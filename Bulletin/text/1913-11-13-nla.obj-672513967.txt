[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was sunset in December.
And the tide was softly flowing ; *
Every cloud was like an ember
Redly glowing.
As we floated on the river
Green cicadas shrilled and chorused,
And a bell-bird, chiming ever,
Thrilled the forest.
All the trees were still and solemn,
Each a sculptured something seeming —
Dryad, naiad, satyr, column,
Softly gleaming.
As we drifted there together,
Through that scene divine, enthralling,
Sometimes flashed a crimson feather ,
Earthward falling.
In the depths the rose-light trembled,
On the surface, ripples breasting,
Lay a fleet of leaves assembled
For far-questing.
Homeward sailed each grey sea-rover —
Hawk or gull from beach or ocean —
Tired of wing—his questing over,
Tired of motion.
0 what mattered fame or money,
Or the woes that set us sighing
To the bee bagful of honey.
Hiveward hieing?
Then came Night—his high throne climbing,
And the sky hung golden-fruited.
And the bell-bird’s sylvan chiming —
It grew muted.
Yet, a bell-bird had this forest —
One ivho sang in shadow ever. . ..
Rowing hard, of him we chorused
On the river.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Spinsterette
Apparently the recent suffragette trouble
began some time ago. In Sex Antagonism
(Constable, per Library, Sydney),
the author, Walter Heape, finds the explana-
tion of the matter in Australia, for it is in
this continent that primitive sex conditions
are still to be studied. The exogamy and the
totemism of the Australian tribes are the
two divergent impulses that are at the root
of sex antagonism. “They exert their influ-
ence on all the laws which govern sex
tions in all social communities, and .are never
divorced from the minds and from the
actions of all normal healthy men and
women.” .Exogamy, the custom compelling
an Australian male black aboriginal to
marry outside his tribe, was a i practical
effort to satisfy a male sexual impulse—the
impulse that leads all males, black or white,
savage or civilised, to pursue the Strange
Female; while totemism, the custom which
arbitrarily determined the relationships of
the individuals of a tribe by the idea that
they were the embodiment of certain natural
objects, arose from a desire to satisfy a
female maternal impulse.
This work is largely a criticism of Dr.
Frazer’s, monumental work on Totemism and
Exogamy, whose conclusions are frequently
challenged from the standpoint of a biologist.
Heape, however, admits the enormous
anthropological value of Frazer’s investiga-
tions.
Sex antagonism is a family war, and as
family strife leads to the most bitter of all
quarrels, so this war threatens to lead to
enmity which may last for many years and
work untold evil on the nation....To most
of us a sex war appears to be an entirely
new experience. For 50 years we. may have
noted the gradual growth of opinions which
have led to a more or less indefinite altera-
tion in the tone of the sexes to each other ;
for the last 25 years we may have recognised
just cause for that alteration and some of
the advantages to be derived from it; but
of late we have been face to face with strife
as selfish, as brutal, as bitter, and as un-
restrained as that- shown in any class war
between men alone, and man’s opinion of
woman has been definitely modified —his at-
titude towards her as an integral component
of society can never be the same again.
Heape believes that environment exerts an
enormous influence on the sexual problems
of the day, and asserts that a drastic altera-
tion in our present environmental conditions
would entirely alter the whole aspect of the
sexual antagonism existing among us. Un-
rest among women is caused by biological
law; the suffragette is primarily a biological
problem. Thus, with an ever-changing
environment, there is no possibility of
elaborating any fixed, permanent law regard-
ing sex relationship in any society. Sex
laws appear to have arisen in the female
mind, and to have been adopted by the male
with such modifications as his natural in-
stincts required. And the civilised male,
like the savage male, has always found a way
out of the stricter laws imposed upon him
by more complicated social obligations.
And he always will.
Getting right down to brutal facts, and
considering the woman merely as a female,
without the complication of love, she is
antagonistic to the man. A girl of 14,
asked what she would like best in the world,
replied that she would like to marry and
have four children, then she would like her
husband to die and she would bring up her
family. This, says Ileape, is the inherent
feminine attitude toward the male before
love is introduced.
Once the children are produced, the
mother desires freedom to bring them up.
The male is no longer desired by her when
once the productive stage of her life is over :
he then occupies only a subordinate place
in her life work, and is, in fact, from a
sexual point of view, only a nuisance to the
woman when that time conies. Such a feel-
ing is constantly to be found in women,
though they themselves often do not recog-
nise the force which is driving them ; they
only have a feeling which, as a rule, they
are ashamed to confess, but it is actually
the same feeling which this girl, speaking of
her natural instinctive desires, thus plainly
expressed.
On the other hand, speaking of the same
primitive stage of civilisation, the male
looks primarily upon the female from a
sexual point of view, and when, either tem-
porarily or permanently, she fails to attract
him, he will look round for another woman
to take her place. These are the bare,
brutal facts. These are the biological neces-
sities which tend to thrust the sexes apart.
The female’s desires, which though comple-
mentary to those of the man for a period
in their joint lives, are quite different from,
and eventually become diametrically opposed
to, his needs end to the natural forces which
drive him. So there we are.
The sex war is waged most fiercely in
times of peace: in times of stress, in the
days of great deeds and sacrifice for pat-
riotic ends, a truce is signed between the
sexes. When man’s and woman’s energies
are most strained, the woman is least fearful
of neglect, least anxious about her influence,
and has least i reason for such fear and
anxiety. In these times of peace and plenty
the suffragette rages—and the male sets out
to stalk the Strange Female. Ilis instinct
is not necessarily morally vicious. His
pursuit is “due to the power of a natural
physiological law which overcomes all other
considerations, braves all abuse, and over-
rides all the rules of social etiquette devised
by the female” —the other female, the one
that stayed at home.
To-day woman is fighting independently
of man: she is conducting her own war.
This is a somewhat rare phase in civilised
woman; *we have long been accustomed to
her methods of using influence with politi-
cians, and especially with the Church, but
to-day she has thrown aside both of these
old-fashioned aids; she feels strong enough
to fight alone. In this respect she is revert-
ing to a primitive condition, and there is
hardly room for surprise that she should
do so, for the war is a sex war, and the
problems of sex are, after those which relate
to food, the most primitive of all problems.
It.is an elemental matter with her; and she
is fighting in a primitive fashion also, for
the sex battles among the Australian sav-
ages were commonly conducted with the aid
of clubs.
So the New Woman is really 4 Very Old
Woman. She was new only in prehistoric
Australia, and probably she wasn’t Very
New then. The suspicion arises that there
must have been times when Adam con-
sidered Eve Rather Old-Fashioned.
J*
But there is a difference between the sex
wars depicted in Frazer’s great book and
the present ones. In the former antagonism
apparently existed between the sexes as a
whole, while in the latter the female army
is largely composed of a particular class of
woman. The authority and power hitherto
held by the mothers of the nation are in
danger of being usurped by spinsters—and
every Suffragette is at heart a spinster.
And serious are the physical and mental
risks run by an elderly spinster making a
hearty habit of bashing policemen or being
hurled out of cathedrals by Herculean ver-
gers. (This habit of hurling out of cathe-
drals will probably lead to bishops providing
many a busted “white hope” with a re-
munerative! and hilarious job as a disguised
verger.) Should the spinsterette succeed in
Winning her war, she will insist on legisla-
tion for the advantage of her relatively
small class of bruised and hunger-starved
dis'turbers of the peace; and, biologically,
this class is superfluous. Their interests
being directly antagonistic to the interests
of the women who are concerned in the pro-
duction of children, spinsterette legislation
will be opposed to the interests of the
mothers. The waste products of our female
population will gain power to and re-
gulate the work of those women who are
of real value to the nation.
These conclusions have to be gathered
from a book that is mainly concerned with a
biological examination of Dr. Frazer’s
theories. Especially -valuable, though hardly
available for elucidation here, 'is Heape’s
suggestion that Frazer and other Australian
scientists have erred by accepting the state-
ment of the Australian aboriginals that they
were ignorant of certain natural facts. It
is on this alleged astounding ignorance that
Frazer based his great theory of the origin
of totemism.
John Musene[?]
John Masefield’s Dauber (Heinemann,
per Dymoek’s Library) is the best of his
narrative poems, though the story suffers,
as all Masefield’s long poems suffer, by its
metrical shackles. In this narrative of a
young artist who ships on a sailing vessel
as painter in order to learn to paint the sea,
who learns, through terrible hardship, also
to be a man, and how to meet his death like
a man, the poet has splendid opportunities
for descriptive work, but fails to make a
work of art of the whole by the necessary
intrusion of rimed prose. A stanza such
as this, inevitable in a narrative poem,
muddies the clearness of his flowing theme :
The watch was called: Dauber might go
below.
“Splice the main brace!” the Mate called.
All laid aft
To get a gulp of momentary glow
As some reward for having saved the craft.
The steward ladled mugs, from which each
quaff'd
Whisky, with water, sugar, and lime-juice,
hot,
A quarter of a pint each made the tot.
Stuff like that comes between stanzas of
genuine inspiration and perfect execution.
The wester came as steady as the Trades;
Brightly it blew, and still the ship did
shoulder
The brilliance of the water's white cockades
Into the milky green of smoky smoulder-
The sky grew bluer and the air grew colder.
South ward she thundered while the westers
held,
Proud, with taut bridles, pawing, but com-
pelled. . . .
To come, after long months, at rosy dawn,
Into the placid blue of some great bay.
Treading the quiet water like a fawn
lire yei the morning haze teas blown aivay.
A rose-flushed figure putting by the grey,
And anchoring there before the city smoke
Rose, or the church-bells rang, or men awokei
And then, in the first light, to see grow clear
The long-expected haven filled with
strangers—
Alive with men and women: see and hear
Its clattering market and its money-
changers;
And hear the surf beat, and be free from
dangers,
And watch the crinkled ocean blue with
calm
Drowsing beneath the Trade, beneath the
palm.
Masefield has re-issued his early Salt-
Water Ballads (Mathews, per Sydney Book
Club), first published 11 years ago. These
are yarns by a sailor-man who happens to
be a poet, not poetry by a poet who happens
to admire the sea. lie tells of: —
The wives and girls they watch in the rain
For a ship as won’t come home again.
“7 reckon it's them head-winds,” they say,
“She'll be home to-morrow, if not to-day.
I’ll just nip home I’ll air the sheets
’N’ Imp the fixin’s ’»’ cook the meats
As my man likes ’•»’ -as my man eats.”
So home they goes by the windy streets,
Thinking their men are homeward bound
With anchors hungry for English ground,
And the bloody fun of it is, they’re drowned!
And of “Bill.”
He lay dead on the cluttered deck and stared
at the cold skies,
With never a friend to mourn for him nor
a hand to close his eyes:
“Bill, he’s dead,” was all they said; “he’s
dead, ’n’ there he lies.”
The mate came forrard at seven bells and
spat across the rail:
“Just lash him up .wi’ some holystone in a
clout o’ rotten sail,
’N’, rot ye, get a gait on ye, ye’re slower ’n
a bloody snail!”
When the rising moon was a copper disc and
the sea was a strip of steel,
We dumped him down to the swaying weeds
ten fathoms beneath the keel.
“ It’s rough about Bill,” the fo’c’s’le said,
“ we’ll have to stand his wheel.”
And of the fine “Ballad of Cape St. Vin-
cent.”
Now, Bill, ain’t it prime to be a-sailin’,
Slippin’ easy, splashin’ up the sea,
Dossin’ snug aneath the weather-railin’,
Quiddin’ bonded Jacky out a-lee?
English sea astern us and afore us,
Reaching out three thousand miles ahead,
God’s own stars a-risin’ solemn o’er us,
And —yonder Cape St. Vincent and the
Dead.
There they lie, Bill, man and mate together,
Dreamin' out the dog-ivatch down below,
Anchored in the Port of Pleasant Weather,
Waitin’ for the Bos’n’s call to blow.
Over them the tide goes lappin', swayin’,
Under them's the wide bay’s muddy bed,
And it’s pleasant dreams —to them —to hear
us sayin ',
Yonder’s Cape St. Vincent and the Dead.
Hear that P. and O. boat’s engines dronin’,
Beating out of time and out of tune ,
Ripping past with every plate a-groanin’,
Spitting smoke and cinders dt the moon?
Port a-lit like little stars a-settin’,
See ’em glintin’ yaller, green, and red,
Loggin ’ twenty knots. Bill —but forgettin',
Yonder’s Cape St. Vincent and the Dead.
They’re “ discharged” now, Billy, “left the
service,”
Rough an’ bitter was the watch they stood,
Drake an’ Blake, an’ Collingwood an’ Jervis,
Nelson. Rodney, Hawke, an’ Hoive an’
Hood.
They’d a hard time, haulin’ an’ directin’.
There’s the flag they left us, Billy—tread
Straight an’ keep it dyin' — recollectin’.
Yonder’s Cape St. Vincent and the Dead.

Canada and Literature
“Left Hand” has something vehement to
say re a cold country where even poetic feet
freeze.
You were asking some time ago what is
the matter with Canada, which has prac-
tically no literature. As a transplanted
Australian (only temporarily so, thank
God), who has lived in this cold country
for more than a year, I can speak with
authority. Canada has no literature be-
cause Canadians liaye no souls. They are
the most villainously commercial people I
have ever met. They speculate, they finance,
they trade, and they gamble morning, noon
and night, and if they wake up with a pain
in the middle of the night they get up and
finance some more. During my sojourn here
I hdve mixed with people most likely to
be interested in literature, yet never have I
heard one word spoken with pride or other-
wise of the literary products of the nation.
The only occasion upon which I heard
Canadian literature hinted at was when a
national poet died. The bard in question
was Pauline Johnson, the daughter of an
Indian chief and a white woman. Her
prose was better than her poetry, which was
Indianised Tennyson, but she wrote some
Indian legends in prose which may live.
The trouble is with the climate, which is
not conducive to poetic feeling. The ghastly
Canadian winters freeze a man’s soul to
death, and the summers in most places are
so short and hot that they either kill a
man’s body or render it too flabby to do
anything much. History shows that poets
thrive best in warm, sunny climates like
southern Europe or Australia. Byron spent
a lot of his time in Italy, and so did Shelley
and others. When in Australia I had the
verse habit, the products of which were
almost invariably rejected by the cow who
answers correspondents, though I occasion-
ally struck him in a sympathetic mood.
Here in Canada I cannot raise the spectre
of an idea. I know two newspapers in one
city which print above their editorial col-
umns the bald statement that they do not
pay for poetic contributions. conse-
quence is that the general public’s literary
standard is shockingly low. American maga-
zine tripe is chiefly read, and of course the
best sellers from Uncle Sam’s land.
Not only is the taste for literature lack-
ing, but it also has the same low standard
in all forms of art. The dramatic companies
of Canada would give any ordinary Aus-
tralian Bill the shivers. I have seen pro-
ductions in Canadian theatres which would
be hooted off any Australian stage. Even
the companies touring wayback towns in
Australia are a hundred per cent, better
than those I have seen here. The actors
here are a poor lot, the plays are varied and
horrible, qnd, the staging the most criminal
thing I have ever seen done to the drammer.
However horrible, the play produced by
Australian mummers, .the acting is always
too good for the piece, and the staging ditto.
Some of the Canadian cities have stock
companies which present a new play every
week. The result of this quick change
business is too vile to detail.
Canada has produced practically no
singers, for voices do not thrive in the frigid
atmosphere, and as to art —I have never
seen or heard of any. There is nothing in
the country to inspire the bard or the artist.
There is some fine scenery, but it is cold
stuff. Imi -firmly convinced that if Henry
Lawson. Victor Daley, B. "©’Dowd or any
other Australian bard had been transplanted
to this atmosphere, they would all have
ceased singing and gone into the real estate
business. I say this because my own poetic
punch (such as it was) is gone, but when I
get back to Australia (which please the gods
will be soon) it may come back. Anyhow I
intend submitting 47 poems a week to The
Bulletin on my return, and if the female
bull who_ reads them turns them down I’ll
kidnap him and bury his lifeless corpse in
ten feet of Canadian snow —so look out.

The following interesting letter is written
“To CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“From May to the end of October, 1912. I suffered
agonies with acute MUSCULAR RHEUMATISM.
My ankles, knees and shoulder joints became
swollen and painful, and the excruciating pains in
my back were almost unbearable. I was in a
helpless condition, could scarcely, stand : to make
matters worse, I completely lost my appetite, and to sleep at night was out of the
question.
“I had the best medical advice and medicines, Turkish and hot salt-water
baths out of number, also was massaged three times a week, but all to no purpose.
“I began to despair of ever being well again, and, as a last resource, concluded
to try CLEMENTS TONIC, I had read so much of it.
“I did so, and I FELT A WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENT. By the time
I had finished my second large bottle the swelling of the joints and pains in the
back left me. my appetite had returned, and I slept well. When I was on my
fourth bottle I felt as vigorous and strong as I ever did in my life.
“I can now go about and enjoy myself with renewed energy, that makes life
worth living. I have only Clements Tonic to thank for coming to my timely
assistance, when all other remedies failed to restore me to perfect health.

A WOMAN'S BIRTHRIGHT!
A CORRECTLY
BUST!
Every woman can have a perfect figure. A deficiency in bust is
readily corrected by Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-Food treatment. The best
evidence is that of those who have used it. It is never-failing. See
what MRS. K. WINGROVE, of Gympie, Queensland, a skilled nurse,
says of its efficacy:—
“After leaving off your treatment I waited several months
to see if the results were permanent before writing you, and
I now wish to say that I think the treatment is absolutely
marvellous. Before adopting it I was only skin and bones,
hut now I am one of the best walking advertisements you
could have. It did all you claimed for it and really more,
and the results were startlingly ahead of my fondest expec-
tations. My health and appearance have improved most
satisfactorily, and I now thank you for urging me to have
the treatment.”
We haven’t room to give you more letters here like this one, but we will send you scores of
them upon request. We possess thousands of grateful testimonials.
Many cases gain as much as 51b. a week, and improvements up to as much as ten inches
have been made in the bust measurements. Guarantee given in every case.
Put up in tablet form, it is pleasant to take, and palatable. It leaves no unpleasant after-
effects, and the results are permanent and lasting. It can be taken secretly.
Free illustrated Book ! Free Trial Sample !
We want you to know just what FLESH-FOOD is, and will gladly give you a free sample,
■lend a 2d. stamp, and let us forward a free trial sample and our instructive book on attenua-
tion, “Lovely Women.” No matter where you live we can treat you successfully by post. All
correspondence is confidential and private, and all our literature is sent closely covered and free

I See Through You.
I see through you! Thank Summer for the
sunlight,
That makes transparent what you call
your skirt.
The oldsters rave. But you are Sydney’s
one light
Amid the ugly sights that sear and hurt.
Your shadow limbs are very fair to view.
While you are in the sun 1 see through you
O Sex Deceiving, Man would not be glummer
If motives were as plain as legs in summer.

SILHOUETTE.
Spring and the Curate.
The breeze doth blow, the bees do hum,
There’s blossom on the tree,
There’s something in the air—-there’s some-
Thing very wrong with me.
My head is buzzing like a hive,
Although I shun the cup;
My bosom seems to be alive
With tigers waking up.
My eye is strange, my gait is coy,
My Bishop looks askance;
I want to simply shout for joy
And leap about, and dance,
And deck my hat with buds a-fire,
And cast aside my vest,
And capture maidens from the choir,
And clasp them to my chest!
What imp thus in my heart doth creep,
Defying prayer and search?
I tell you, I can scarcely keep
From dancing jigs in church!
And when abroad, with mirth unmeet
I take to dreadful crimes,
I’ve winked at ladies in the street,
Not once, but several times!
(To tell the truth, with little art:
Their eyes just opened wide —
They could not see the lover’s heart
Beneath the curate’s hide.)
I can’t tell where the thing may end,
This may not be the worst:
I fear, unless my ways amend,
I’ll go upon the Burst!
So now, as smug as heart could wish,
I toddle from the dean’s
With parcels full of potted fish
And lots of good tinned beans.
With these I’ll stock my pantry shelf,
And till the Spring hath flowed,
Like oyster I shall keep myself
Within mine own abode !
VICTORIA.
TIMOTHY TITMOUSE.
Gipsy Heart.
Oh! I had the heart of a gipsy and you
had the heart for home,
Oh! the heart of the gipsy seeks the trail
though the body may not roam.
I am sick to death of the patch o’ corn and
the checkboard square of loam!
I have the soul of a firefly that some wood-
god lit in play,
While your feet keep close to the girding
rut of the Most Accepted Way !
And I am sib to the restless night and you
to the suave blue day!
A chain has linked us we cannot break, yet
we ever draw apart.
(My blood remembers an old, old trail where
the blue flame fireflies dart!)
While my body bides will you never see
that I die of the Gipsy Heart!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Wooroonora.
The fishes play on the sandy shoals, as the
flowing tide comes in,
And the breezes whisper from hill to hill,
and the hymns of the night begin;
A lone bird cries, and the creeping things
that wake in the dark are heard,
And the winged creatures that haunt the
gloom by the spirit of night are stirred.
In the still sea-arm, far, far from the sea,
the warm tide softly creeps,
With scarce a sigh on the sandy sills, and
silently over the deeps ;
So faintly the shimmer of silver stars in the
shadowy mirror shines,
With no more light than the glow-worm’s
lamp on the dim of the darkling pines.
The scented air of the summer night, like a
bee, with the blooms has played;
And the waft of its wings is a zephyr sweet
as the breath of a sleeping maid ;
While, up from the tide, cool odors rise, to
tell to the dreaming air
That a water-nymph is shaking the mist
from the coils of her starry hair.
’Tis she that is making the young bats flit
and the silver fishes leap ;
’Tis she that is waking the owlets, too, and
the moths from their long day sleep ;
’Tis she that is lulling our listening ears
with the rhyme of her dreamy croon ;
’Tis she that is closing our watching eyes to
the glow of the rising moon.
The silvery sprites in the tide swim low;
the bats and the owlets glide
On silent wings, and the creeping things in
the mossy hollows hide.
The hymn of night is hushed in the swoon
of that crooning song that stills
All sound beside on the sleeping tide, all life
on the slumbering hills.

MOTOR LORRIES
Make Quicker Deliveries at Less Cost
Ilalley and Commer Motor Lorries can cover within a given period six times
the distance of horse vans. That means one lorry is equal to six ordinary
vehicles. Think of the difference. It means a remarkable saving! But, and
this is just as important, Halley and Commer Motor Lorries also cost much less
per mile. That again is a saving!
These Motor Lorries are designed specially for hard, continuous service under
Australian conditions, being fitted with steel wheels, extra large radiators to
prevent overheating, special axles, springs, frames and dust-proof chain cases.
The gear is also a particular feature. It is “fool-proof.” Even in the hands
of the most careless drivers the gear wheels are not liable to “strip” and need
costly repairs.
Ilalley and Commer Lorries may be had with a carrying capacity ranging from
30cwt. to 5 tons. It will be to your best business interests to investigate
these lorries, which have received high awards for excellence in open Competi-
tion.
We will arrange a trial by appointment. Full particulars on request.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tun Bin, in:tin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions. ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addri ssed to
the Editor, bni to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, Tim Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person mug not be.
there; the official always is.

THE DISASTROUS ALLIANCE.
Tiik spectacle of the Conservative of to-day
denouncing the views which he held yester-
day is encouraging, in a way, to advocates
of progressive idras. It is as frequent
almost as the sunrise. For example. Admiral
Fremantle was reported in the Australian
papers (5/11/T3) as having written the
following to. the London Morning Post: —
The Australian Navy is not a tinpot navy ; it is a
force to be reckoned with.
It would have been difficult to find one
Liberal, on the morning on which the above
appeared, who was in disagreement with the
Admiral. Yet the phrase “tinpot navy,”
as applied to a local fleet, originated with
Australian “Liberalism” —with the party
which is now so satisfied in regard to the
uesfulness of a local fleet that it has begun
to claim as its own the policy which led up
to that institution. Protection, compulsory
service. alien immigration restriction,
a graduated land tax, and countless other
essential reforms have been opposed furi-
ously by the people who bedeck themselves
with the title Liberal in much the same in-
congruous spirit as the cannibal islander
dons the garments of some defunct clerical
victim. The M.L. Arbitration Act was duly
denounced by Toryism everywhere on its
°rst appearance; and when B. It. Wise
introduced its prototype to N. S. Wales in
IiMJI he was represented, by the Liberals of
the period, to be a species of criminal idiot.
Arbitration was said in those days to be the
last word in “mad experimental Socialism.”
It was opposed to every tenet of true Liberal-
ism. It tended to degrade free workers to
the position of helots. It essayed the impos-
sible task of abrogating the laws of supply
and demand. It was un-British. It inter-
fered injuriously between master and man.
And so on.
However loudly the alleged representa-
law and order cursed at the different
political and social reforms that were put
forward from time to time, there was always
one section of the community which equalled
them as regards the vehemence of its pro-
tests No Dreadnought enthusiast assailed
the Australian navy scheme with more bitter-
ness than the I.WAV. spokesmen did. When
the U.S. Fleet visited Australia five years
ago the Revolutionists were as apprehensive
of its possible effect on the growing Defence
sentiment of the Commonwealth as the
stoutest of the Tories. The deplorable
lom Mann issued a manifesto 'to the visit-
ors which began : “Comrades and Brothers
of the United States, we know and you also
know that the navies of the world
are utterly inimical to the true in-
terests of the workers, and exist ex-
clusively in the interests of the Dominant
I lutocracy.” And the ex-publican from Lon-
don wound up by warning Australian
workers to have nothing to do with a navy
lest its guns should be used against
them, just as Liberals—such as W.
E. Johnson, M.P.— implored them to
turn the idea down lest the new
navv’s guns should be used to batter
ihe warships of Britain. Liberalism op-
posed compulsory service, originally, on the
grounds it amounted to conscription;
and the I.W.W. took a precisely similar
stand. Liberalism argued, ten years ago,
that alien immigration restriction was an
unjust interference with the rights of one
who. whatever his color, was a man and a
brother. Liberals like Bruce Smith were
particularly strenuous on this point. The
I.W.W. spoke, likewise shrieked and howled,
to the same effect. Between them, these two
sections managed to give the outside world
the impression that, in connection with the
loss of the s.s. Petriana, the Australian
'government had ruthlessly pushed foreign
manners into the raging seas —for no better
reasons than that the visitors were black
and that Australian legislation demanded
that colored seamen should be so mishandled
under certain circumstances. It may be
stated fairly, as a general proposition, that
wherever Toryism in Australia takes up a
stand in opposition to any innovation of
moment, there are to be found, ranged along-
side, the social revolutionists—the people
whose main arguments are the brickbat and
the bomb, and whose idea of sound govern-
ment consists in the overthrow of all laws.
Up to a certain point criminal stupidity and
stupid criminality see practically eye to eye.
The main difference between the attitudes
of the two sections lies in the fact that
whereas the Social Revolutionists remain
irreconcilable in their foolish and villainous
obstructiveness, Liberalism has, as above-
mentioned, a way of becoming converted to
new doctrines, once the electors have declared
definitely for them. The tragedy is that
oiten,. by the time the conversion occurs,
irretrievable damage has been done. For
years the principle of Arbitration suffered
more by assaults from the Liberal papers
than by any other form-of attack. As a
matter of fact, one of the bases of Arbitra-
tion namely preference to unionists—is still
almost as abhorrent to Liberalism as it is
to Anarchy. Yet collective»bargaining, the
diplomacy of industrialism, is impossible
without preference. If negotiations between
the employees and the employers are to come
to anj thing that is worth while, the unions
must obviously be strong—so strong that
anarchic outsiders will find it impossible to
edge m and smash up the negotiations. And
it the employers are to have any hope of a
fair deal, the same state of things must pre-
vail. Unionism must be so strong and so
universal if the masters are to be safe-
guarded that the possibility of a legal levy
by way of penalty, on the funds of any given
union, will represent a genuine menace to
the men. The beneficial results to the com-
munity ot a powerful Trade Union were
S A < r V y i \ forcib ly at the time of the Waihi
(AI.L.) mine row, when a number of I.WAV.
Revolutionists considered that they were
so strong, and solid Unionism so weak, that
they (the Revolutionists) were in a position
to order a strike. They were mistaken. It
tinned out that, despite their own efforts
and the efforts of Conservatism during the
previous half-dozen years, the working men
or the locality were still in possession of
their senses. The would-be strikers were
chased out of the mine, and toil was resumed.
In Maonland, at the time of writing, Liberal-
ism, Conservatism, Toryism, or whatever it
elects to be called for the moment, is reaping
the inevitable reward of its unnatural alli-
ance in the past with the party of disorder
and bloodshed. As the S. M. Herald— the
paper which was most envenomed in its
assaults on Wise’s Arbitration Act —had the
naivete to put it last week :
Australians are watching the progress of the strike
in New Zealand with more than ordinary interest
because the issue which is at stake is one which will
sooner or later have to be faced in the Common-
wealth. Is the principle of the peaceful settlement
of industrial disputes by arbitration or mutual anree-
ment to enduie, or are the workers to revert with
impunity to the clumsy, anti-social, aimless weapon
of the strikef y
If the principle of the peaceful settlement
or industrial disputes by Arbitration is
turned down on a big scale in Maoriland. and
sabotage makes its appearance, and the
Dominion starts to run with gore, papers of
the b. M Herald stamp will be largelv to
-r> ? s they are nlaying the game
ot the Revolutionists now in their opposition
to such forms of insurance against industrial
unrest as are involved in the Constitutional
amendments advocated by the Federal Labor
Party-, so they played the game of the same
undesirable folks in their past assaults on
the Arbitration principle. The M.L. strike

HENARE’S ASSET.
Henabe, of Maoriland, has one valuable
asset, and the earth-hungry are swooping
down on it like a kite on to a dead Malay.
Henare of old had no need to provide for
his latter days. He was often spared any
anxiety in that direction by providing some
enemy with a long meal, of which he him-
self was the principal dish. When he was
the diner and not the dinner', the bush,
streams, dead logs, the ocean and the
cultivation plots supplied him with all
he wanted in the way of food and
shelter. No capital was needed to
work' the scheme, only as much energy as he
and Meri were inclined to use. There is
practically no bush now. Also the eels are
scarce in the rivers, and the white man’s
trawler has scooped up the ocean delicacies,
so that what Henabe once got for the taking
has now to be paid for in hard, cold cash.
But his land is still there, and what little
is left of it to Henare has the covetous
eye focussed on it.
The Church has had a cut or two. Henare,
in some instances, received in return a
weatherboard church and occasional lessons
in the management of a universe by a God
whom he didn’t care two dried eels about.
Sometimes, when HEnare began to compre-
hend that the deal was a tritie lopsided, he
would make a strenuous effort to recover his
asset, but he usually received only a lawyer's
bill for his trouble. There is no record of
the “cloth” ever wanting to swap the land
back. Some of the other methods of obtain-
ing Henare’s asset were just as thievish
if less unctuous. Forty or 50 years ago there
was the “rum and blanket era.”- The quan-
tity of rum and the gaudiness of the blanket
often effected a deal to the extent of thou-
sands of pounds’ worth of land. It is re-
corded of one old chief that, seeing the folly
of the white man in parting so readily with
the precious blanket, he offered to sell to a
squatter a fair slice of the sea. However,
there was no business that time.
Subsequently, “te Ivuwwerment” framed
laws by which Henare was protected and a
number of individuals were provided with
good billets. The Land Court and Board
were established to attend to Henare’s
rights and wrongs. A Government valuation
was made of his asset, and those who were
wolf-hungry for a slice of it were invited to
come on. A deposit was paid, and Henare
was requested to get himself into debt as
rapidly as possible. He generally did this
with great vigor. His casualness was still
with him. The most remarkable thing about
the asset was that as soon as Henare had
been paid for it, its value doubled or trebled.
Lhat may possibly account for the earnest
desire of the squatter to relieve Henare of
the brown man’s burden.
The man who now Ministerially manages
the Maori for Bill Massey and co. has
evolved some new ideas, including a Bill
whereby Henare will be enabled to rid him-
self of his asset much more expeditiously
(ban heretofore. Any Maori may apply to
have him (or her) self This
whitewashing of Henare enables the agent
and the buyer to deal with him without an
inquisitive Board prying into the deal. One
of the first transactions of this kind has occa-
sioned a great amount of comment and heart-
burning. The “successful purchasers” were
the native's own lawyer and a trustee. It is
more in sorrow than in anger that the adjoin-
ing squatters condemn the deal. The sorrow
is for themselves, not for Henare ; they
didn’t get a look in. Then there is the new
Native Land Laws Amendment Act, of 123
clauses. No.. Go allows any minor who has
acquired Native land to be treated and recog-
nised at law as if he or she were 21 years of
age. This, of course, is to allow the two-
months’-old infant of McAcres to deal with
the Fencing Act, 1908, and facilitate that
infant s settling on the land. It is not in-
tended to encourage dummying.
Taking a clean, square view of Henare’s
affairs, it looks as if he is going to be assisted
along the high road of ruin with as much
expedition as possible. Meanwhile the motor-
man, the lawyer and McAcres are having
the time of their lives. But when the last acre
is sold and the last motor-clar scrapped,
Henare is goine- to be very hard-up. And.
being a physically weakened Henare, there
will be an increase in tangis and tears, and
a brown man laid as a permanent burden on
the State. There will also be quite a number
ot white people a lot richer in land and
money than they would be if they owed no
more than they had honestlv and'fairly got
AN INDUSTRY WHICH PRIVATE
ENTERPRISE SHOULD BE PRE-
VENTED FROM FOOLING WITH
ANY LONGER.
From the recently-issued report of the stock
branch of the N. S. Wales Agricultural De-
partment :
A disquieting' feature of the last and present parade
season is the comparatively large number of us’less
undersized, characterless brutes, mostly crossbred,
that have been presented for inspection, even at th*
Royal Agricultural Show or parades. That public
opinion and ridicule are not sufficient to keep such
fro ™ beln £ presented is a clear indication
that the horse-sense of the community requires
awakening. That so-called thorough-bred horses out
of trotting-bred mares, coachers which are half-bred
draughts, ponies whose only qualification is being
under 14.2, draught horses out of saddle mares,
should be used is surely bad enough, but that such
animals should be submitted for inspection at parades
held under the auspices of nearly evCry agricultural
society in the State furnishes much food for reflec-
■Wr!u ' V;/ here ® re far to ° man y entries of all breeds
in the State. It seems more difficult to buy a gelding
than a stallion. The only way to limit this multi-
plication of entries is to tax them.

It is upwards of five years now since The
Bttlletin began to draw attention to the
tact that the horse trade of Australia was
going to blazes. One factor after another
has arisen in recent years to deal fatal
blows at any chance the Commonwealth mav
ever have had of forging to the front in this
important line of business. The S’African
war denuded the country of most of its
contemporary light and heavy remounts.
Japan took further large consignments when
its trouble with Russia started. India.
Ceylon and ‘the East” generally, which had
aiwavs been by way of favoring the Waler
began about this time to patronise the Aus-
tralian horse 111 earnest. The local animal
got one useful advertisement at least mu
of his visit to the wars of the past decade •
namely that, whatever Ins class, and w’
soever ragged and weedy he might apnea,'
his mgs were mostly hatter and his feet
sounder in all circumstances than those of
the average prad which was available from
other lands But Australia, as a nation
gained nothing thereby. Japan has ha i
buyers here ever since its last big war l'ri
vate dealers, yellow, brown, black and'other
vvise in hue, are continually drifting about
the backblocks, and through their agencv
a steady stream of fair to rotten horses
more or less suitable for military purposes'
is for ever pouring out of the country A
usetul object-lesson in regard to the scarcity
of suitable cavalry mounts in N. S. WiPs
< and N. S. Wales more or less typifies‘the
other states) was presented during the
capital-founding ceremonies at Canberra
Some of Australia’s crack light-horse regi-
ments figured in the march past the Gov-
ernor-General. A suburban circus could
not have supplied anything more bizarre than
many of the animals which the warriors
bestrode. One noticed here a lathy 12st
bushman urging forward an intensely light-
weight pony whose proper metier in life
was plainly the draggage of a milk cart •
and immediately beside the anomalous outfit
a bravely-feathered individual on a hairy
heeled steed, giving every indication of being
about SO per cent, cart horse. Similar in-
felicities were rife on all sides, stressing
with depressing persistence the difficulties
which even well-to-do cockies and such-
like labor under in the way of acquiring
horseflesh suitable for military purposes.
The tragedy—and, nationally speaking it
is a tragedy—arises partly from the un-
natural depletion of the Commonwealth’s
horse-supply that has been going on for the
past 13 years, and partly from careless
breeding, which is itself, in a sense, the
outcome of the other trouble. The outflow
is likely to continue —even in the wildlv-
improbable event of the Government impos-
ing something in the nature of an export
duty on horses —till the indigenous remount
degenerates so utterly as to be no longer
worth buying. Obviously, therefore, the
needed move is for the Commonwealth and
the States to proceed straight to the seat
of the calamity, and forcibly reform this
country’s breeding methods. All are equally
interested, from the patriot statesman who
regards the efficient horse as a prime neces-
sity to national safety in war time, down
to the mere trader, in whose eyes the noble
animal is no more than a pawn in the game
of barter and exchange. The Commonwealth
might begin playing its part in this connec-
tion by the establishment of national studs,
such as France, Russia and most other civi-
lised countries have run successfully for
generations. The States should provide
legislation designed to debar blemished and
diseased stallions from being sent about the
country, perpetuating equine wasters at
small fees. The different A., H. and P. Asso-
ciations could show their gratitude for the
heavy subsidies which they draw from the
States by altering their programmes and
prize schedules in such a way as to encour-
age farmers and others to breed animals that
are genuinely of the hunter, or, in other
words, the cavalry class. To this end they
should sacrifice their present system of giv-
ing big prizes to alleged hunters, which are
incapable of getting across any country that
is more toilsome and less circumscribed
than a flat and resilient circus ring. The
hunter type is what is needed, and this is
the animal that should be catered for by
those in authority, irrespective of whether
or no it happens to be a trick jumper at the
particular time it is exhibited —a point
which has been recognised by those in con-
trol of the great English horse shows at
Richmond, the Crvstal Palace and else-
where, from their first beginnings. Private
Enterprise has. been allowed a free hand in
the horse business in Australia for many
years. The upshot of it all is that expert
opinion makes no bones now of the fact that
this vitally important industry threatens to
hit the rocks, if indeed it hasn’t already
done so in great part. The State, or the
Socialistic Tiger, or whatever one may call
it. is evidently about its only hope of sal-
vation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Break of Gauge.
The report of the Uniform Railway Gauge
Conference (held at Melbourne in December,
IUI2, and April, 1913) flutters out of the
Department of Dome Affairs to say the same
old thing with the same old prospects. The
Conference was asked to investigate the ques-
tion of a uniform gauge, from the point of
view of efficiency and economy of working,
bearing in mind the conditions likely to be
experienced in Australia in future. The
important decision of the Conference was
that a uniform gauge would be imperative
in connection with military movements,
should they at any time become necessary.
Dn that the whole series of commercial de-
cisions hangs. And the series is clamorous
for the attention which it is not receiving.
1 hese are the days when the Commonwealth
hears above the howl of party differences
and personal insults in its national Assem-
bly the gibe of the Japanese schoolboys that
their future “home” is Australia. It hears
the cable humming with the news that John
Bull’s Navy, which was the boasted all-
and-all protection of the *‘colonies,” is penned
up in John Bull’s backyard; it hears the
menaces of nations at straining point with
each other, and even the most blatant Empire
Day orator knows that this continent can
ultimately only be saved for the White Man
by the handful of local population. To
that end, nothing is so important as effective
railway communication to the place where
the argument will be conducted. At present
the railways of Australia stagger in a hope-
less way to a collection of dead ends, with
varying gauges to conduct them to their
blank destinations. An army unit rushing
north, say. from Adelaide 'or Melbourne,
would px - obably save time by packing itself
and its guns and baggage into bullock-drays.
In addition to saving time, it would save its
transport officers, to say nothing of its
general, who would require a whole lunatic
asylum after striking the first State fron-
tier. But the uniform gauge must come.
The job *is inevitable. Invaluable time will
be wasted while cheap and vulgar politicians

call each other “body snatchers” and liars,
or punch each other’s noses, or are hurled
into the night by eight-bob-a-day policemen ;
but this great national railway work
has to be done. And so that the
people who have to foot the bill may
get close up to where they stand in
the business, let the report of the Confer-
ence speak. The commissioners “wish to
emphasise the fact that the longer unifica-
tion is postponed the more serious will the
cost become”; and this is how they prove
their case :
The estimated cost of conversion of the 4ft. Bpn.
eauge lines in New South Wales in 1897 to a gauge
of sft. 3in., including alterations to rolling stock,
amounted to £4,260,000, whereas, at the present
time, the cost of the same work is estimated at
£19,319,000. It was also estimated that the cost
of converting the sft. 3in. gauge lines in Victoria
and South Australia to the 4ft. 84in. would amount
to £2,360,500, while to-day this work is estimated
at £7,295,000.
There is nothing wrong with those estimates.
In N. S. Wales, for instance, the track
mileaee to-day is nearly double that of 1897,
and there is a ton-mileage approximately
three'and a quarter times greater than that
of 15 years ago, when the representatives of
the N. S. Wales, Victorian and South Aus.
railwav systems prepared estimates. The re-
port of the last Conference thinly veils a
grave w’arning which has been repeatedly
made, but as far as the tap-room politicians
of Australia are concerned, it falls on ears
deafened by the shouting of the party “whip”
and the riot round the seats of pay and
privilege.
An Object-Lesson for the Citizen who
Disbelieves in the Existence of Trusts.
One A. W. Pearse wrote to the papers last
week in violent disparagement of High Com-
missioner Reid’s warning remarks on the
subject of the U.S. Reef Trust. The some-
what astounding Pearse took the point that
there were no injurious trusts in Australia
—an argument that has been abandoned
largely even by stark Conservatives for the
past year or more. According to Pearse :
The word “trust” is being used now purely for
political purposes. .. .All the talk about “trusts” at
the present time is purely political dodgery, etc.
Though Pearse and people like him don’t
seem to know it, there is at least one trust
in N. S. Wales which hits the small stock-
owner —and Pearse runs a paper allegedly
in the interests of stockowners. This par-
ticular trust is called the N. S. Wales Flour
Millers’ Produce Co., and its operations are
dealt with in the recently-issued report of
the N.S.W. Commission on Food Supply.
No one can be a shareholder who does not
own a mill, and shares are held by prac-
tically every -miller of substance in the
State. The idea is to control the output of
bran and pollard; and very effectively the
job is accomplished. Each shareholder is
pledged to furnish the co. with a weekly
statement of the bran and pollard that he
has on hand. He also informs the co. as
to how much of it is “surplus stock.” The
“surplus” estimate is arrived at in an in-
genious fashion. A price is fixed by the co.,
at regular intervals, for bran and pollard,
so far as the local purchaser is concerned.
If he cannot pay that often-exorbitant price
the unsold produce becomes “surplus stock.”
The co. thereupon takes the “surplus stock”
at a price a trifle less than that which was
asked of the local man, and exports it. As
the Royal Commissioner put it in his Re-
port :
The effect of the company’s operations in exporting
each individual miller’s “surplus” (i.e., the quantity
he cannot sell locally within a fixed time, at the
fixed price) is to make the export trade a lever to
keep up the local price to a level considerably above
what it would otherwise be, and also above that
generally obtainable for export.
A result, manifestly injurious to- the public,
has followed from the formation of this
combine. In the first place, the export of
millers’ offal (bran, pollard and sharps) has
increased. Whereas the average annual
value of exports in this line was £26,928 in
the four years preceding the arrival of the
Flour Millers’ Produce Co., it has swollen to
£35,042 in the four years following that
occurrence. Secondly, the importations
have shrunk—the co. having consistently
lowered prices upon the arrival of imported
stuff, so that the importers were driven to
sell at a loss. Stockowners and poultry
farmers have consequently been smitten both
ways. The local supply has been sent away,
and a supply from other States debarred
from coming in. The running of the stock-
owner’s or poultry-farmer’s business on a
profitable basis has been rendered propor-
tionately more costly, and the increased
charges have naturally been passed on to the
lone-suffering public. It is an interesting
example of the way a trust operates to hoist
prices. And innumerable other trusts are
acting similarly in innumerable other
hvppues of industry: and they get their
chief encouragement from ignoramuses like
Mr. Pearse, who aver blatantly that “all
the talk about trusts is purely political
dodgery.”

Hayseed and Arbitration.
Hayseed, who isn’t generally considered a
humorist, supplies the only visible humor so
far in Maoriland’s serious industrial situa-
tion. Possibly it is because Hayseed isn’t
a' humorist that he can be so humorous —
but that is irrelevant. In a rough-and-
ready way of speaking, the trouble is that
certain wharf and other workers, who either
think they have a grievance against their
employers or are in sympathy with those
who think they have, decline to recognise
the Arbitration Act, and want things fixed
up on other lines. The employers won’t
look at the men’s method, but put their trust
in the Court, and refuse to be on speaking
terms with any organisation that declines
to register under the Act. In fact, it looks
like a higgledy-piggledy scrimmage between
freedom of contract and arbitration —with
the employers battling for arbitration. The
N.S.W. Employers’ Association lately de-
clared that arbitration was a failure; but
this is irrelevant also. At this point Hay-
seed enters —enters hurriedly on his own
or a borrowed horse to volunteer as a special
constable at Wellington to prevent the
strikers from driving a large boot through
the Arbitration Act. If his word is to be
relied on, Hayseed abhors the mere men-
tion of arbitration ; and whenever the rural
workers speak of organising and asking a
Court to act as referee in the dispute be-
tween them and Hayseed in the matter of
harvesting wages and so on, Hayseed snorts
violently through his whiskers, and inquires
what has become of the liberty of the sub-
ject. In fact, judging from his usual atti-
tude, Hayseed yearns to drive a .large
pitchfork into the innards of Arbitration.
Consequently Hayseed, tumbling over his
moke’s neck in his haste to offer himself as
a sacrifice in defence of Arbitration, is a
humorous spectacle, and brightens consider-
ably an otherwise murky situation. Still,
we accept his devotion and pin it in our hat.
It may come in handy for future reference.
Japan, China and Us.
“The Pariah” on Nippon’s atti'ude towards
China, with casual mention of Europe, Aus-
tralia and one or two other unimportant
continents :
Writing in The Bulletin of October 23, “Orient”
says: “The Japanese action towards China is a mys-
tery to me.” Well, two things explain it: Fear and
the latter-day tendency of countries to agglomerate.
The history of China and Japan for at least 16
centuries overlapped. Japan uses Chinese ideo-
graphs ; its religion came through China ; and until
40 years ago Japan made no noteworthy move unless
impelled by China. The literature of both nations
bears this out. China looked upon Japan as its
pupil, and rather a fit subject for commiseration.
When Japan began to assimilate Western civilisa-
tion, China scornfully threw the pupil off, and, later,
had no hesitation in throwing itself confidently into
the war of 1895-6. The healthy drubbing China re-
ceived, and the unhealthy concessions and indemnities
it had to disgorge, opened its eyes to the fact - that
“European” methods had improved the former pupil
tremendously, though it was not until after the
Boxer outbreak of 1901 that China, by an Imperial
edict, admitted that it had been mistaken in assum-
ing the abject inferiority of the Caucasian.
The Chino-Jap war in 1895 was provoked by
"Japan’s meddling in Korea’s business. "As one Japan-
ese apologist puts it: “It was to Japan’s iijTeregt to
reform and strengthen Korea, and to China’s in-
terest to keep the Korean Government “ corrupt and >
weak.” As, a matter of fact, the Japs, were equally
guilty of corruption. They corrupted the whole
Korean Court, with the exception of the Empress,
and, their programme of “reform and strengthening”
included the burning alive of this brave
woman. The scoundrel who- perpetrated the
outrage was found guilty by a Japanese
Court, but was acquitted on the ground that his
patriotism had led him to overstep his duty. A
grateful Mikado then conferred upon him the second-
highest “order” in the land. Japan’s real reason
for interfering with Korea was to annex it, thus
securing a firm footing on the mainland to oppose,
the advance of Russia. The war with China was,
however, a mistake, for Russia forced the victorious
but unfinancial Jap. to forego all his northern terri-
torial concessions and accept a large indemnity
instead. Russia then calmly grabbed nearly all
that Japan had demanded.
Quite naturally the Chinese laid all the blame on
Japan, and their former contempt gave place to
hatred. Up to the time of the Russo-Jap war Japan
was assiduous in wooing the favor of China, but its
diplomacy failed to impress the Chinese. Neverthe-
less Japan cleverly managed to riddle China with
■ spies. This was done in the first instance by the
T6-A Do-bun Kwai, which had the outward seeming
of a reciprocal educational campaign for the training
of Japanese students in China, and vice versa. Japan,
of course, chose the sites of these training schools,
and bore nearly all the expense, with the result that
to-day it has thousands of officers and men who can
speak the official language (Mandarin), and at least
one of the more prominent dialects, of which there
are 18. Dr. Kan-Ichi Asakawa, a noted author,
writes of this move that the Jap. students “compiled
monumental works on the politics, geography and
economics of China, which in their thoroughness and
accuracy are unrivalled in any language.” The
Chinese students, who were bona fide, had no oppor-
tunity afforded them of compiling such works on
Japanese matters.
Meanwhile, Russia, on the principle that the silent
hog gets most acorns, had been making good its posi-
tion in Manchuria Japan, still predominant in
Korea, chattered wildly as the sniffing snout of the
Bear approached his comfortable arbor. The Chinese
dragon was not in the least disturbed. Russia had
occupied Manchuria. Well, she, China, could not
fight him, so good-bye, Manchuria! But not so
Japan. As Dr. Asakawa puts it, “Russian aggres-
sion in these two countries (Manchuria and Korea)
threatened the vital interest of Japan for all time to
come.” All through the diplomatic waste of time be-
fore diplomacy gave place to war, the lying Jap. gave
it out that he was desirous of nothing but the restora-
tion to China of the three Manchurian provinces. As
soon as the war was over, he not only refused to
hand the provinces over, but, in spite of China’s
protest, built railways, which are described by
Asakawa as “commercially useless.” Japan has
not even to this day handed control of the provinces
to China, but has established military stations
throughout their length and breadth, and kept them
in a state of lawlessness.
China thus has no cause to be over-friendly with
Japan, and Chinese leaders look patiently for the
day when their 400,000,000 will be sufficiently well-
trained to launch an army against the pick of Japan’s
50.000,000. This fear of the awful, almost-uncom-
plaining patience of China accounts for Japan’s atti-
tude towards that country. Japan has failed to
placate its erstwhile mentor, and recent and future
Japanese action will be directed to the delaying of
China’s progress. The policy will be to hamper and
pester China all it can. Two instances have been
mentioned in the cables. The shooting of the Jap.
looters and the disproportionate demands of the Jap.
Government are only a few days old. The forced
dismissal of Admiral Li (who was remodelling the
Chinese navy), over the Tatsu Maru 11. incident
(1908), was the other.
In Europe two great movements are keeping poli-
ticians awake at night. These are the pan-Germanic
and the pan-Slavonic activities, which have passed
from the realm of idealists and poets, and are in the
hands of political schemers. The aim of each of
these movements is to gather into one nation all
races kin in language, in blood, and, to a lesser
degree, in religion. As Russia is the head of the
Slavonic movement, it is likely that the first step
towards “the great mission” of Occidentalising the
Orient will be by means of a war with Japan. That
war will not be postponed one day longer than neces-
sary. The recent aggressions and demands of Japan,
added to the Slavonic loss of Adrianople, will serve
to hasten the event. In such a war Japan would pre-
sumably be beaten on land, but its sea-power would
be undiminished. Then what would be Australia’s
outlook ? Japan would have to find a place for some
at least of the 4000 colonists who each month are
directed into Manchuria. The Philippines have been
barred against them. There remain only uninviting
Africa and —Australia. And unless some Ministry
more patriotic than the Cook band of tinkers gets
busy soon, the north of Australia will be painted
dirty brown.

The Holman (N.S.W.) Cabinet still has
the time, if it has the nous, to mitigate the
unfortunate plight of the Labor party in the
Second Chamber. There is no fixed number
of members in the House of Relics, and as
Labor has not had the power before, it is en-
titled now to restore the balance accumulated
against it in half a century. Moreover, the
House is not up to its supposititious strength.
Even if the Government were defeated, it
would still, according to blessed precedent—
precedent of which this paper certainly thinks
mighty little —have the right to nominate
members in order to equalise the handicap.
In Britain every retiring Ministry appoints
peers; and, in the Ma State, Dibbs, in 1894,
after a defeat in the country, nominated
eight members. The Governor, Duff, ’cer-
tainly refused to accept the nominationsbut,
acceding to the claim that the Government
had the right to nominate, he offered to
appoint six. This Governor had been Whip
of the British Liberals for years, and had
been patronage secretary of the Gladstone
Ministries, so he knew the practice in these
matters. The Holman Government ought
to have made its position effective in the
nominated Chamber long ago. Its inertia
has, indeed, been criminal. And if it goes
out of office without repairing the wrong it
has done to the democracy of the State, it
will thereby furnish one more reason why
it should never be given the chance again.

Digby Denham, of Queensland, goes to
London to try his hand at loan conversions.
In view of Cohen’s temper just now, Digby
has a tough job in front of him. especially as
the amount is a cool £14,000,000. And it is
all the tougher because 12 years later another
equally frigid £10,000,000 come due to bother
the man who will be Treasurer then. These
are the times when men see a whole flock of
aged chickens clucking back to the roost.
While Denham is away, too, anything may
happen. Already there is a cloud looming
over the appointment of the Acting-Premier.
Old-man Barlow is most spoken of, for no
better reason than that he always is spoken
of on such occasions. Nobody professes to
think he is the best man ; his chief qualifica-
tions, in fact, is that he is so poor a man
that nobody could be jealous of him. It is a
dreadful system of government under which
it seems ouite the natural thing to appoint
a locum, tenens for such a reason. If Den-
ham applied the same weird principles to
his private butter business, everybody would
say he was quite mad. And no doubt he
would be. Some day the public will wake
up to the fact that it also was quite mad to
permit the absurdity in connection with its
own affairs.

True to its traditions, the Legislative Coun-
cil of Tasmania has refused to agree to the
purchase of the Hydro-Electric Co.’s unfin-
ished undertaking, on the plea of lack of
proper information regarding the value of
the-scheme; The real reason seems to be a
very different and a far more unworthy one
-—not entirely unconnected with the vested
interests of the Ilobart Gas Co. The Solo-
mon Government is hardly likely to fight the
Legislative Council, so the probability is
that the works will be completed by Pirate
Enterprise, which will approach Parliament,
directly or indirectly, for further conces-
sions. Tasmania has had some awful ex-
periences of pirate enterprise in the matter
of public utilities. Some years ago it gave
away the tramway rights of Hobart, and
last year the public had to buy them back
for a pot of money. The main railway line
between Hobart and Launceston was pur-
chased for over a million, and last year it
was proposed to give the V.D.L. Co.
£232.000 for a line that cost only about
£150,000 30 years ago. Yet with all these
examples staring them in the face, the old
champions of vested interests in the Council
continue to play into the hands of private
company-mongers. Sweden has spent
£4,0*00.000 in developing its water-power:
and Switzerland, Germany, France and
other European countries are doing much in
the same direction in order to encourage
manufacturing industries. Tasmania could
have had a 20,000-h.p. scheme for under
£300,000, but is denied it by the selfishness
and crass stupidity of two or three more or
less interested legislators. It is time a
public demonstration was made against non-
representative second chambers. Labor has
had their abolition or reform on its plat-
forms for years, and in doing nothing when
they have had the opportunity, Labor
Governments have failed in their very first
duty to the people.
Australian shipowners might well tear a
page from the logbook of the British Ship-
ping Federation. This Federation is a body
composed mainly of owners, and is a sort of
central authority for the mutual arrange-
ment of all sorts of subjects affecting owners
in the lump. For many years it has been
worrying over the shortage of shipmen, and
has done good work in sending apprentices
to sea. But a lot of factors, have been cut-
ting down the supply of raw material —the
wiping-out of the windjammer, the increased
captures bv the Navy, the expansion of the
foreign merchant-marine, etc. —until the
Federation has at last been driven to frame
up a new rule to counteract the calamities.
This new rule provides that every steamer of
from 400 to 2000 tons gross must carry one
boy and train him, or make a contribution
to a fund for the benefit of others who will
do it; and every steamer over 2000 tons and
every blue-water windjammer must have at
least two beginners. As the press-gang
is (nominally) extinct, and as owners can’t
well kidnap youngsters and ship them off.
the boy will have to be attracted legitimately,
which means that his wages and labor con-
ditions and prospects will have to be made
as good as those of shore lads. It is, of
course, alleged that the sea hasn’t the old
attraction for a youngster. But that is
doubtful. A two-line advt. for a pirate ap-
prentice would bring just as many applica-
tions as ever it did. But modern parents
are more anxious to push their youngsters
along, and a sea-training under recent con-
ditions has been too expensive for the aver-
age father with a crew of kids owning able-
bodied appetites. If, however, the Federa-
tion owners train their boys, instead of
merely making navvies and slushies of them,
there will be an eager rush to fill
up the vacancies. The Australian naval
people have had experience of that already.
At first there was. it was croaked, no hope
of getting young Australia to take to the
sea. and volunteers were for a while very
scarce. Now. even so soon, the conditions
being found satisfactory, there are more ap-
plications than there are vacancies.
The operative bakers in the various States,
having federated their unions, are now get-
ting ready to gather all employees in
minor branches «f the foodstuffs industry
into one body, with councils in each State.
Which is sensible: but unfortunately the
first proceeding of the Victorian branch was
to order a ballot of its members as to whether,
they were agreeable to a general strike for
the purpose of securing “day” baking. Hav-
ing federated, can’t the unions lay their
plaints before Justice Higgins without
striking? There is plenty of time for strikes
later on —in the next world for choice.
The ca’ canny system and the malingerer
aren’t monopolies of the bowyang classes.
Australia’s Public Service has more than its
fair share, and the trouble seems to be in-
creasing. In 1910 the number of officers
who were absent from duty, ostensibly on
account of sickness, was so considerable
that the service was then practically
threatened with the medical inspection of
all officers reported off duty—this to protect
the public’s pocket and secure the proper
performance of the public’s work. In 1912,
in the Postal Department in N. S. Wales,
there were 5942 officers, and 1250 of these,
The Mountain Labored.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Cook (to Mr. Groom): Sit down! Don’t
answer the question. They are like a lot of dingoes
over there. (Interruption.)
The Speaker : Order ! Order !
Mr. Cook: Behave like men. (Uproar.)
Mr. Page : I rise to a point of order. I for one on
this side of the House object to being called a dingo.
(Laughter.)
Mr. Cook : I have not called the hon. member a

Mr. McDonald (Q.) : It is not true. (Interrup-
tion.)
Mr. Cook: I did say that there was a noise like a
lot of dingoes. (Cheers.) —Parliamentary report.
A patriot spake thus to an eager throng:
“Give me the power and / shall right each
wrong.
And Fortune, smiling, on our land shall
look ” —
His name loas Cook.
Lo. I beheld, throughout a continent.
A nation wrestle with affairs of State,
And patriotic cries, where’er I went,
Poured forth alike from groundlings and
the great.
I heard man reason with his fellow man ;
From shore to shore rang out one mighty
screech,
As, daily, from a thousand platforms ran
Rivers of speech.
Consul and Senator keen combat waged.
Doctor and Saint joined hotly in the fray ;
North, South and West and East the battle
raged ;
And ev’ry citizen had much to say ;
Bland politicians talked incessantly—-
It seemed a very battle of the gods ;
Though much they said appeared to me to be
Over the odds.
Then 10, upon the great Election Day,
The day appointed for the mighty test,
Cab, jinker, motor-car and humble dray
Hither and thither sped at the behest
Of rival statesmen whose bold streamers
flared
On wall and hoarding. .. .You can guess
the rest —
’Twere easy spared.
My wife remained at home to mend my socks ;
But forth went I to claim my sovereign
right,
To win my freedom at the ballot-b0x....
I got back home at twelve o’clock that
night.
Or was it two next morning? I forget.
But I had done my duty like a man ;
Helped in the noblest schejjie man’s fashioned
yet—
The Party Plan.
And then a solemn hush fell on the land
(I was content, considering my head,
Next morning). And behold, on ev’ry hand,
Expectancy and hope one plainly read,
Till through the land rang out the herald’s
voice
Telling the upshot of that mighty fray:
“Joseph is consul! Citizens, rejoice !
’lp, ’ip, ’ooray!”
Rejoice I did ; and my prophetic soul
Saw for my country happiness and peace.
For he had reached at last the longed-for
goal.
Now would our corn and oil and beer
increase!
What would it profit else, this strife, this
pain—
A mighty Nation shaken to its soul?
Lans good result, all hope (’twas very plain)
Was up the pole.
Into the Hall of State I blithely went,
Eager to hear the dignified debate —
Grave, reverend seigneurs in grave argument
Engaged, discussing great affairs of State,
Wise counsellors.... But stay! What’s here
amiss?
Are these the honored makers of the Law?
Now Heav’n defend our Party Plan ! for this
Is what I saw :
A yelping, clamorous, unruly clan;
A small, hold, agitated, snapping man:
And, as they raved, his fist he fiercely
shook —
His name teas Cook.

or 21 per cent., were absent for periods of
not. less than six days. Those absent for
periods of less than six days were more
numerous still. Sickness became such a
settled policy, as it were, that investigators
were put to work, and some of the things
they found out would make a corrugated
tank blush. In one State, it was ascertained
that of lJf cases of absence only six were
justified. In another State, a little mouse
from the telephone exchange was visited at
her “sick bed” by a medical officer of the
department. This girl had from the begin-
ning of the year been absent for an aggre-
gate of 80 davs, and on this occasion bad
produced a medical certificate in support of
an application for seven days’ sick-leave.
The. Department’s medical officer found her
sewing busily, but he couldn’t find anything
else the matter with her calculated to pre-
vent her working for the people who were
paying her salary. So serious has this epi-
demic become that the Public Service Com-
missioner has notified the departmental
heads that immediate dismissal of proved
malingerers will meet with his most enthu-
siastic approval. Such plain robbery de-
serves nothing less, and it would no doubt
be particularly appreciated by the thou-
sands of honest people in Australia’s Public
Service who are striving to do a fair thing.
Wade is not our only hero. Arthur Grif-
fith, like Tom Bent of deplorable memory,
is now a full corporal in the Degion. At
every function or meeting he attends we are
told of his boxing and swimming and athletic
doings-—generally of about 25 years ago.
How true it is that the world knows nothing
of its Greatest Has-Beens—-until they have
to fight an election !
The other day Premier Watt, his Minister
of Public Works, sundry departmental offi-
cers and the Melbourne Harbor Trust Com-
missioners decided to deepen the entrance to
Port Phillip Heads to 40 feet in two and a
half years, and to 43 feet by the year 1920
or thereabouts, with corresponding depths, in
the channel up to Port Melbourne. Making
the customary allowance of 12 feet for
“scend” at an ocean entrance, this will per-
mit of a maximum vessel draught of 31 feet
—by 1920! It is an admirable deed to
make one blade of grass appear where none
was before, but the axiom hardly ap-
plies to harbors. They cost so much more
to conjure up than grass, and the enterprise
Iqoks like wicked waste when Nature has
provided ready-made ports close at band.
The other day a South Melbourne con-
stable interfered in a local street fight so far
as to pleasantly advise the combatants to
“drop it and go home.” So scandalised were
they at his unsporting conduct that they and
the spectators set on him earnestly with
stones and bottles. Drawing his revolver,
the menaced official effected an orderly re-
treat, and subsequently proceeded against
the two chief bombardiers on summons.
The Court —honorariums, of course —told
the latter that they were “cowardly scoun-
drels,” and a “disgrace to the city.” and
fined one 10s., and the other, who had a
“record,” 20s! Presumably if the disgrace-
ful cowards had slain the constable, the
honorariums would have told them they were
absolute bounders, and handed them a trifle
from the poor-box.
Ex-Postmaster-General Frazer complained
bitterly in the representatives the other
right that, after he had cut the Western
Electric Co. off the list of tenderers to the
Commonwealth, for retaining £5900 of Cus-
toms refunds which should have been handed
in to the Postal Department, his successor,
'.gar Wynne, removed the embargo on the co.
The money had previously been refunded.
Said Wynne:—
As soon as the embargo was placed on the Western
Electric Co., there was a lock-out among other
people, and it cost the Department more than £ 5000
or £6OOO in thp interval until I had removed the
pmbargo. Now that these people have been allowed
to tender again, prices have come down more than
that amount.
All of which ; goes to prove, of course, the
correctness of the Cook party’s battle howl
that there are no Combines in Australia.
“Trotter”: Nutta Singh was a venerable
hawker in Victoria a month ago. He was a
Sikh', whose religion is an amalgam of
Mohammedanism and Ilindooism. All Sikhs,
by the way, are named Singh, which means
Lion. Well, Nutta Singh passed out quietly
in his waggon, at his camp, two miles from
Charlton. With proper expedition the body
was enclosed in a casket and laid on logs,
and a load of wood was piled round it. A
crowd was drawn to witness the per-
formance, including a number of women, but
only two Sikhs were there. One, as priest,
conducted the service. Kerosene was poured
< n the wood, and as the flames rose the Sikh
who was seeing the other off said : “I pray
God to give this gentleman a first-class
heaven.” All being reduced to ashes, these
were buried : but the teeth were carefully
nicked out. They will be sent to India, and
dron-wfl into th» sacred Ganges. And as I
pondered on it I thought—barring the busi-
ness with the tusks —what a model for our
barbarous funerals, which nowadays trot
briskly to the festering graveyard !

The Quinlan Opera Co.’s 1913 production
of “Tristan and Isolde” fell short of the
same company’s 1912 performance of this
love-and-murder story. There was just as
much love in the recent show, but less mur-
der. In the 1912 production the last scene
was a fair representation of a shambles.
Everyone on the stage was either dead or
dying, or stricken unto .death with remorse.
Also this year’s “Tristan and Isolde” was
weaker in its song for the absence of Agnes
Nicholls and John Coates, who warbled in
the name parts last year. Perceval Allen,
usually a thoroughly reliable mediocrity in
Wagnerian thunder, was overweighted in
the strenuous music which the German com-
poser allotted to Isolde —just to show how
much he loved her. Tristan (Francis
Costa) falls in love with Isolde, or is pushed
into it by her lady-help Brangaene. This
interfering minx (Edna Thornton in the
part) gives Tristan a strong dose of love in
solution, instead of the lysol or prussic acid
which the then love-crossed Isolde had de-
signed for him and herself. King Mark
(William Anderson) has the same sick kind
of place as King Arthur in the story of
Lancelot and Guinevieve. His business is
to forgive everyone, and he did it in a deeo
bass voice to music supplied by Eckhold and
his fiddlers. It was necessary to the busi-
ness of the opera that King Mark, who is
despised by the audience, since he is only
Isolde’s husband, should arrive too late to
arrange for the peaceful elopement of his
wife with Tristan. Like many kings, he is
a person of unpunctual habits. Still, he
arrives in t : me for the funeral of the whole
company. Melot, the mischief maker (Syd-
ney Russell), is the Mrs. Grundy of the
opera. He is an enraged old person in a
straight white wig and wide skirts —no X
ray husseydom for him! Melot fights Tris-
tan (after telling Mark about his philander-
ing with Isolde) and wounds him mortally
in half a round. Prior to this. Tristan and
Isolde have warbled one of Wagner’s great-
est duets for quite 30 minutes. Isolde sang

into the back creases of Tristan’s fat neck,
and, he poured forth his devotion into the
lady’s hair. Eavesdroppers heard nothing
that could be used against either party, for
the orchestra was a magnificent chaperon.
Robert Parker. Tristan’s faithful servant
Kurwenal, was very good. It was a busy
time for hitn when the hero’s death-struggles
were in their crescendo movement. He had to
watch the conductor’s beat, keep Tristan on
his couch without sitting on his chest, and
sing some of the composer’s most trying
dissonances, and he did it without turning a
hair.

“Madame Butterfly” was one of the Quin-
lans’ best efforts. Puccini’s music is the egg-
flip of grand opera. There is just a tang
of something stronger—say burnt brandy—
to make it go to the nose, and hardened
opera-goers industriously blew that useful
organ in the final scene. This tribute to
Jeanne Brola’s powerful acting as Mrs.
Butterfly Pinkerton was well-earned.
Vocally she was better placed than usual.
Maurice d’Oisley, the Lieut. Pinkerton
(U.S.) who flirts through a mock-marriage
ceremony with Cho-Cho-San (“Butterfly”),
is too stout and phlegmatic to do more than
sing his music with careful attention to
business. Goro, the marriage-broker (Syd-
ney Russell), and Prince Yamadori, who
sought the hand of Mrs. Butterfly, were
picturesque additions to the bungalow scenes.
Yamadori looked so much like a handsome
fire screen that it was startling to see him
open his mouth in song. Parker, who has
been buried in Wagnerian beards during the
greater part of the present season, was bare-
faced for once, as the colorless Sharpless. Like
all the good examples in opera, Sharpless
is up against the development of the plot all
the time. Mabel Dennis, whose diction is a
delightful proof that the present company
sings in English, was admirable as Suzuki.
' oghera conducted the orchestra in a manner
that.went far to prove that his good opinion
of himself is often justified by results.

The Adelphi continues to find “For the
Term of His Natural Life” a most profitable
sentence, and up to now there is no mention
of last nights. Between struggles, the
theatre is roping in a flock of chorus angels
for its Christmas “Aladdin.” A melodrama
done in pantomime would have been a
novelty, but the Adelphi is evidently sticking
to the old style.

The latest addition to the Tivoli bill, Eric
Stone, provides a turn that would be very
like Bert Levy’s if it were a lot better than
it is. The caricatures are, however, labelled,
so the public can’t complain. Taken all
round, the item isn’t likely to make the rest
of the programme, and especially the Mullers,
Cooke and Rotherts. Bellora and the Prim-
roses, fade away in despair.

“The Wizard of the Jungle,” at the
Emnress, was the best effort of the Williams
theatres this week. The picture, which is
ouite as good as any other “jungle” film to
dab?, was taken under the eye of Capt. Bona-
vita, and contains some remarkahlv «
scenes. “Thirty Years of a Gambler’s T u

At West’s two big Svdnpv
theatres, the Glaciarium and Olympif ttv
are this week starring “Fortune’s Wheel-
and as the said wheel is always in motion
and the spoke which is uppermost will soon
be under, it is advisable for the public toTe
a move on.

Though “A Butterfly on the Wheel” at
Melbourne Royal is alleged to have been
written by two presumably hard-headed
politicians, small traces of acumen are dis
covered in the four acts. Sentimentality is
its keynote, and all the scenes and the prin-
cipal characters suffer from the disease of
over-emphasis. The heroine, Teggy Ad-
mas ton, is something for cynics to smile at
Her purity is beyond description, and her
artlessness goes to the length of believing
tlmt the ardent companion of piquant
tfße-a-tetes at perilous hours is merely seek-
ing the enjoyment of her conversation" Of
course she affects to be terribly shocked
when her “friend,” Oollingwood. carries his
suit to the verge of impropriety, but her
professions in this regard are no more con-
vincing than her protestations on the same
subject when a Divorce Court barrister’s
rude examination earns the disapproval of
every flapper in the audience. For a married
woman, Peggy seems a theatrical fraud
though, . through Miss Madge Titheradge’s
art. it is. almost possible to believe in her
virginal ignorance of human nature. Col-
li ngwood is not a very natural conception
either; at any rate, he pursues the line of
least consistence wherever possible. Nothing
can exceed the cold and calculating wicked-
ness with which he plans to trap Peggy in
a Parisian hotel, yet when there is a pos-
sibility of a Divorce Court throwing the
lady into his arms, he adopts a stunt of re-
morseful humility and contrives to keep her
joined to her lawful husband. This is a
Part w 7 herein Lewis Waller’s elderly ease of
manner rather suggests the finished philan-
derer than the hot-blooded young seeker of
unseemly pleasures. Waller, however, puts
plenty of force into the earlier scenes,
though his nassion is rather loud, with the
result that his first-aot overtures sound like
a public meeting. The third figure in the
infernal triangle—the aloof husband with
the “career” and the faraway 100k —is
suave]v taken by ITalliwell Hobbes, whose
angrv passage with Peggy in the second act
seems an exhausting display of neurotic
onei'o'v. I- rank TV oolfe is the heavy-tongned
barri«tcr of the third act, while the tall
Beerbohm (Lord Ellerdine) tempers his
natural ennui with an occasional show of
interest in his surroundings. Miss Marianne
Caldwell’s idea of Pauline is pleasantly
middle-aged : and Miss Alma Vaughan’s pic-
ture of Lady A twill is pardonable until her
hnal tumult. The first act has most solid
charm : the character of the third may best
be judged by the circumstance that it causes
most dabs at the female eye.
To-morrow (Friday) will see the last of
A read’a at Melbourne Her Majesty’s; on
Saturday the New Comics are to return to
civilisation in tb« military musical play
called “Autumn Manoeuvres.” The piece is
allegpd to be full of martial ardor, pic-
turesouenecs. and similar intangible assets,
and is understood to noke gentle borak at
J. Bull’s unfortunate Territorials.
This (Thursday) afternoon will be the
one and oDly matinee opportunity of hear-
ing .John McCormack at the Melbourne
Auditorium. For several nights past John
has uncorked his warble at the Tait strong-
hold. and though he has been heard by
crowded houses, there seems no lessening in
the demand for the seductive brand he has
in his throttle. People get drunk on the
Irishman as they do on Wagner and Charles
Garbage, and the average Melbourne flanper
refuses to mention his name without calling
him a darling. John returns to Sydney in a
couple.of days: then, after a series of four
plebiscite concerts beginning on Saturday,
he sets out for Maori]and to tell the local
inhabitants all about Mother Machree’s grey
hair.
The Bulletin still finds no cause for
great joy in “A Day at the Races” at Mel-
bourne King’s. The nlot is a poor pretence;
and with the exception of Bert Le Blanc
and his quaint little female namesake, the
principals, make n> noticeable success at
characterisation. The fat Dutchman of the
troupe merely succeeds in being cheerful

The “cleanness” of “A Day at the Races,”
however, is above suspicion, and the entire

Life at Cripple Creek is being lived once
more at Melbourne Princess’s, where Cyril
Mackay is now the noble Joe Mavfield, forc-
ing public morality on local miscreants with
the persuasive eloquence of his gun. Vivian
Edwards has to shoulder Martin Mason’s
load of perfidy, and he does his job well —
much better than Herbert Leigh does his.
Leigh’s Manuel Alvarez leaves a lot to be
desired. Horace Nightingale as the ochred
Injun. Wahkeetah, contributes his quota to
the artillery practice, and Brandon Cremer
throws himself about as the nigger Ben
White. Miss Elw.vn Harvey is a walking
poster-advt. for the goodness of Belle Gor-
don ; Miss Nell Holroyd is the pride of the
district; and Miss Marie D’Alton satis-
factorily escapes poison as Dynamite Ann
to succumb to her conscience and become a
loud Wowser in the land. Other people take
part in the riot and carry on the fine art of
assassination until their ammunition gives

Melbourne Opera House is the present
refuge of Du Calion, who manufactures

for a short spell on Saturday, and Gene

still demonstrating their skill on the roller
skates; Lillie Langtry keeps her place on

to support Miss Willette Whitaker from the

“The Battle of Gettysburg” was West’s
chief attraction in Melbourne last Saturday.
A thin love story meandered through the
disturbance and got lost in the general blood-
shed ; but the film mainly portrayed imag-
inary or historical incidents in the famous
scrap from which Lee finally withdrew with
all the dignity he could raise at the time.
“The Demand for Justice” and “The Flood
Tide” were likeable dramas, while “The
Melbourne Cup, 3913,” served as the usual
unwelcome reminder of fickle horseflesh and
false hopes.

Of another art show in Melbourne: —
A picture show of interest occupies the Besant
Hall, Centreway, Melbourne. The work is by an Aus-
tralian, who for some years has been winning laurels
away from here. Clewin Harcourt is an artist whose
sanity is very welcome. A tour-de-force is his portrait of
John Brunton, big and burly, his jovial face beaming
and breathing life. One hand in his capacious pocket ;
in the other a cigar, from which the smoke curls
aloft. A virile portrait which proves Harpourt a
powerful painter of strong men. Quite another
phase is “The Smile.” A woman’s head, the subtle
and alluring expression very well managed, yet done
with apparently little effort. Harcourt is also seen
in interiors, rich in color and flooded in warm light.
Here there is no suggestion of muddy pigment. In
the darkest corners there is a feeling of space and
atmosphere. Yet the things are painted with a sur-
prising economy of means; and where a figure is
introduced it is put in au premier coup, with a
full-loaded brush, as in the “Window Seat” and
“The Drawing-room.” Altogether the show is an
exposition of sound craftsmanship and good composi-
tion, and proves that pictures need not be bizarre
to attract the public, even in Melbourne.
“G. R. Q. Wallingford,” at Adelaide Royal,
is still a brisk, unusual play, remarkable
chiefly for its acting. Fred Niblo bustles
engagingly and with magnetism through
what used to be called a “Charles Matthews
part,” though the touches of almost-pathos
are not the least effective bits. Maurice
Dudley and Josephine Cohan play up to him
well, and the whole unnecessarily-big cast
bustles too. At the Tivoli, the Merian dogs
still walk through a village comedy in boots ;
Frank Parish still leaps into barrels and
over chairs ; and the Golden crowd still give
their weird athletic dances. To these are
now added Williams and Rankin, and Doody
and Wright. La France has taken her pic-
ture poses from the King’s, which now has a
well-balanced co. without any surprises.
Picture-shows tend towards the start-
ling. One of them recently boomed a
representation of cholera on the ground that
it was true to life. .The public doesn’t really

want that kind of thing; but it has eager
eyes for the Empire’s Flying scene, and for
the Italian circus-horse “Leap of Despair.”
At the Wondergraph house West’s have
filmed Hawtrey in “A Message from Mars.”
The Pav. has something new —the descent of
an escaped menagerie on a little town.
Animals generally make the best comedians,
and here are lions at the butcher’s, snakes in
the bar, monkeys all over a fruit-stall, and
two full-grown tigers skirmishing in a parlor.
Jill these houses show the Melbourne Cup,
too. The or)en-air Dandies, very strong
vocally, are steadily working their way into
favor. The visiting Dorothea Spinney is
already there^—has, in fact, become a kind of
Society craze. One evening she had a middle-
aged stockbroker in tears over the sorrows
of a B.C. lady in Troy. It is sufficient testi-
monial.
“S.” : Hatter David Storey, of Randwick
(N.S.W.), seems a certainty for at least
another Parliament, but doesn’t look good
for a ’folio should Wade get back. Twenty
years ago he defeated Edmund Barton, now
of the High Court, and has been receding
ever since. His special kink is like Mr.
Dick’s in “David Copperfield,” only larger.
Mr. Dick used to drag a monarch’s head into
everything; Dave drags in his Majesty,
neck and crop; also the Throne and person,
the dear old Mother Land and the whole
llempire. Amongst the thousand things
that David hasn’t got is an ear for music.
One day a German band pitched in front of
his hat-warehouse and struck up “They’re
all doing it.” David mistook it for the
National Anthem, and solemnly drew off
his grey nail-can covering.
“Billy T.”: This is a true story of a fam-
ily that was somewhat conspicuous in a
southern capital a few years back. The
great lady arrived at the gate of a some-
what swagger but very frivolous suburban
establishment in a hansom, carried the
front door by storm, and arrived in the hall
with a clamor of invective that scorched
the wall-paper. She wanted her husband;
she demanded him instantly; and she hinted
that her intentions with regard to him were
homicidal. But fleet-footed emissaries had
gone aloft with the glad tidings, and within
10 seconds hubby was beating a retreat down
the back stairs. A few minutes later, while
the enraged wife was still storming in the
hall, another clamor burst like a bomb at
the front door, and presently hubby fought
down the resistance of a brace of domestics
and bounced into the hall. “I will have my
wife! I tell you she is here! I saw her
enter not 10 minutes ago. Ah, madam!”
He had arrived in front of the raging
matron. His expression was that of a good
man driven to fury by the despicable con-
duct of the one woman he fondly loved. “So,
I have found you ! A pretty retreat for a
respectable married woman! Madam, it is
no use your protesting. I followed you here ;
I saw you enter. You have been in this
nlace some time. May Heaven forgive you.
I never will!” The bluff worked, and the
full strength of her family’s influence was
necessary to prevent the lord and master
taking immediate action for divorce.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The Geelong (Vic.) Theatre got a star attraction
the other day, and advertised him this way:—
THE RIGHT HON.
SIR GEORGE REID,
Lord High Commissioner of Australia,
who is on a short visit from his duties in Great Britain,
will give his Fatnous Lecture -On
“REMINISCENCES ABROAD.”
Sir George is known as the Greatest Orator who
has spoken from the public platfofm, and is
brimming with humor.
Don’t fail to take advantage of this treat, as
Sir George returns to his duties in Great Britain
almost immediately. Admision, one shilling.
It was an astonishing lot to offer for a paltry bob.
“Stargazer”: Miss TitheFadge, as the heroine in
“A Marriage of Convenience,” overacts to a most
extraordinary excess. Yet the effect is not dis-
pleasing. Accepting the whole thing as an unreality,
the unreality of the Comtesse, as depicted by Mies
Madge, develops a peculiar art interest, like a drawing
by Aubrey Beardsley, or a statue by that quaint
Polish decadent whose work was reviewed in the
“Red Page” some time back. Pretty, graceful,
ingenuous, the Comtesse Titheradge has actually all
the qualities we can ask of Dumas’ heroine, but the
complete effect is bizarre, and the Watteau lady shines
like an ethereal, whimsical figure in a fantastical
dream. It is impossible to believe for a moment that
a connoisseur like the Count could have resisted so
piquant and provocative a vision for 10 seconds.
“Rosna” (from Britain): Australian-born Marie
Ldhr and Alice Crawford are decking gorgeous
chiffons in two of the new autumn plays. In the
matter of looks there are few English actresses who
can touch them; and as for acting, the English
beauty-mummer rarely does it, while the two Aus-
tralians at least make a more than praiseworthy
effort. Marie Lohr plays Adele Vernet in “The
Grand Seigneur”—a glorified yellowdrama of the
powder-and-patches period, played at the Savoy. Alice
Crawford is the beauteous lady villain in “Collision,”
at the Vaudeville, Which on present showing doesn’t
promise much of a run. It is an Anglo-Indian
romance of a lovely Radipal charmer (Australia’s
Alice), who makes inflammatory speeches about free-
dom to the dusky population of India, and achieves
(1) a rising against the British, (2) plague for
50,000 people, and (3) wholesale collapse.
Sydney theatregoers have been paying for a lot of
holiday trips lately amongst show managers. The
latest to pack up is John C. Leete, who recently
retired from the Tivoli. He intends to wander for
the best part of a year, through the Islands, China,
Ceylon, India, Britain, France, Italy and Egypt.
He knows k.gypt well and wears a medal or two for
conspicuous service as a railway engineer on one of
the occasions when our discolored brother there-
abouts made some strenuous endeavors to put a head
on J. Bull.
“Early Turn” : The managing director of the Rick-
ards’ Circuit, having accopiplished his own business
circuit of the globe, is once again nearing Australia. In
other words, Hugh D. Mclntosh will soon plant his
foot upon his native heath. He does, not seem to
have captured many English turns while in Fogland,
and he supplies the reason: “If I make an offer to
one of the stars in London I find he is ;booked so far
ahead that it is almost impossible to negotiate with
him. In any case, he would want a fancy salary from
me before he would think of breaking his English
contracts.” Wherefore Hugh D. went on to admit
that nearly all the acts he had booked since he left
Australia had been American. “Naines,” asserted
Mac, “mean next to nothing in Australia. Here I
am, ready to offer a splefidid tour at good terms to
real novelties, and I can’t find them in England.”
He managed, however, to secure one “name” in Ada
Reeve, though, to do her impresario justice, the
clever little lady is certainly no “novelty.”
“Snaffle”: It is incorrectly stated that a race has
never been cinematographed all round until this
Melbourne Cup. A so-called all-round-the-course pic-
ture had been taken of the Liverpool Grand National
Steeple, for one. Ten points were fixed around the
Melbourne Cup course, with cameras and operators
at each. Each operator kept his machine going for
about a third of a minute, using 20ft. of film. In
20sec. the camera covers about 300yds., taking about
320 separate photos. The complete picture, formed
of the results of the 3200 or more exposures, was
shown in Melbourne the same night, the work
between-times being done in the operating house
behind the St. Kilda Theatre.
Alfred Moul, one-time musical critic of Melbourne
Age, and latterly managing-director of the London
Alhambra, is now turning his attention to the
picture-palace business. He is announced as chair-
man of a co. that, is going to do big things in the
British provincial cities. Moul was the most bellicose
musical critic that ever sat in judgment on Mel-
bourne warblers, and in consequence figured in more
than one Collins-street scrimmage. His Argus con-
temporary, Henry Keilev, was, by way of contrast,
the most gentle and amiable of men.
“H.E.S.”: Two Australians figure in large print on
the list of artists in the Aborn Grand Opera Co.,
which is to tour the U.S.A. One —-Evelyn Scotney—
has already made something like a name in grand
opera as a coloratura soprano, and for this tour has
been borrowed from the Boston Opera Co., of which
she is one of the plums. The other star, Ivy Scott, is
our own plump Ivy, of the Royal Comics. On her
travels she has apparently found a voice, for her
former pleasing warble wasn’t nearly up to grand-
opera requirements.
From London: Ethel Irving’s latest enterprise at
London Globe, “Years of Discretion,” does not look
like having a prosperous run. It is a story of a
country widow of 48 who wants to enjoy another
gay and giddy youth in London, and enlists the aid
of rouge, false hair, tight shoes and other things
to make herself look in the early 20 s. All sorts
of flirtations ensue, but eventually the lady has to
give it best, acknowledge the deception and own up
to her real age. Here the familiar long leg ot
coincidence gets to work. Her most ardent admirer
makes a confession that he, too, is suffering
from middle-age, and that his young-looking, manly
form is largely the result of artifice. So the curtain
comes down on Darby and Joan —she knitting in a
loose gown, and he taking his ease in skulLcap and
spectacles. Though Ethel Irving does the transforma-
tions uncommonly well, the whole business is merely
a collection of theatrical effects, offering little
opportunity for real acting. The Times critic takes
another stand, and says in severe language that the
play is utterly opposed to common sense, since
middle-aged ladies don’t go in for Ethel’s frolicsome
juvenilities.
“Harrison O.” : The exploiting of obesity as a stage
asset would seem to be on the increase. At time of
writing, Melbourne has just been parted (I fear, but
temporarily) from a mummer who but for the subtle
humor of his embonpoint would long ago have had
to find some useful job. The same long-suffering city
still harbors a musical-comedy performer whose fat is
her fortune, and a quartette of vaudevillains who, in
their advertisements, mention their corpulence as a
weighty reason why they should be patronised. But
why should beef be paid to rush in where bones
would fear to tread ? Merely because G. Reid hap-
pens to be fat, does embonpoint proclaim the artist?
“Spasmode”: In Jerome Hart’s excellent new
American memoir of Sardou it is mentioned that he
wrote a whole scene into a drama while the piece was
under rehearsal, merely to introduce a clever little
girl. The performers were disgusted, but the fireman
on duty laughed heartily. “He is the public!” said
the satisfied Sardou, and the scene went famously at
night. With the same thought in his mind, Moliere
used to read his comedies over to the kitchen wench,
named Martine. “She’s the public!” he would say.
In gratitude he introduced her in one piece, and thus
immortalised her. I recall another case. Verdi was
nervous over his first opera, “Nabuco.” At the first
rehearsal there were carpenters repairing the theatre.
They hammered their loud applause. “The public!”
exclaimed Verdi, beaming, and he was right.
“Bloggs”: According to London Daily Telegraph’s
New York correspondent (3/10/’l3), when Marie
Lloyd was rebuffed by the Customs people for
attempting to land in the sainted U.S. with Dillon,
her jockey friend, she “became hysterical. Her sister
Alice, who, with her little daughter, had come to
the pier to meet the Olympic, told her not to mind,
but to cheer up. Acting on this advice. Miss Lloyd
opened her valise, brought out a bottle of champagne,
and having obtained assistance in opening it, fortified
herself with a glass.” Wise woman ! There is nothing
like champagne to steel one against the shafts of
the caitiff dressed in a little brief authority. The
consumption of a glass or two makes the jack-in-
office look to the valise-carrier what he is—a con-
temptible worm. The end of the bottle puts him in
his proper place as a particularly hilarious brand of
human joke—one fit but to be presented with the
loud Ha! Ha! of contempt and left writhing in
impotent humiliation.
H. B. Irving has been discoursing about his play,
“The Grand Seigneur,” with which he intended
starting a season at the London Savoy in October.
“I am delighted,” he says, “to have been able to
secure the services of Miss Lohr.’ Although the
period is the French Revolution, just before the
Reign of Terror, Irving describes the play as intro-
ducing none of the historical revolutionists-—no
Robespierre, no Marat, no guillotining, no storming
of the Bastille, no anything of the sort. “It is
really,” he says, “a very strong and romantic love
story, written around the great clash between the
nobles and the people.”
From “Rosna” (London) : The Commonwealth
panjandrums here have presented Ada Crossley with
a gold medal as a reward for warbling “God Save
George” at the laying of the foundation-stone
of the Australian building in the Strand. The metal
bears the Australian coat-of-arms and ar, inscription
to the effect that the bearer warbled bsn/i'e a mon-
arch. But why a medal? Why not a barber’s pole
for a change? It would really be just as useful.
(Continued on page 3).)
It is all fake, fake, fake! Last year
money was dear, and the N.S.W. Govern-
ment paid a higher rate of interest for loans
than it had done for many years previously.
Nevertheless the Treasury, though it had to
pay more interest, charged the Railways less
interest in 1912-13 than in 1911-12. In
1911-12 the rate charged was 3.597 per cent;
in 1912-13 it was only 3.489 per cent. Says
the Railway Commissioner (who simply has
to pay whatever interest the Treasury
charges) : “The effect of this on the average
amount of loan capital invested for the
whole year is. a quite unexpected saving of
£57,450.” One of two things is certain:
either the Treasury charged the Railways
too much in 1912 or far too little in 1913.
The chances are that it charged far too little
in 1913 —which means that the Railway sur-
plus in the latter year was faked to the
extent of probably £BO,OOO. Anyhow, if it
wasn’t faked one year, it unquestionably
must have been faked the other year. When
the borrowing politician talks about the mag-
nificent return from “our permanent and
reproductive loan works,” Cohen knows,
even if the blinded public doesn’t, that the
return can be made magnificent by the simple
process of charging the Department (say)
1 per cent, less interest than the Treasury
actually pays.

Sydney’s absurdly congested Central Sta-
tion, where all traffic runs into a dead-end
on a camel-hump, isn’t adding to its circle
of friends. One day last week, when two
engines were manoeuvring in the yards, one
passed over the points before the other had
got clear of its set. The smash, as smashes
go, was a very trifling one ; but it had the
bad luck to be on the main lines between
liedfern and the Central Station, and it
was three solid hours before the morning
business-trains on the main suburban sec-
tion were running normally again. For-
tunately Sydney has never had a Sunshine
smash; but if it does come it will most
likely be at about that spot, and then traffic

Are ships’ cranes regularly tested, or
are they just allowed to rot un-
noticed? At Rockhampton (Q.), one inter-
Stater’s 15-ton crane smashed lately under
an load, and two days later another
inter-Stater’s 20-ton winch crumpled up
under a load of less than 10 tons. Some
dav a man will be hit on the chin by a
falling 8-ton boiler, and then he will be
annoyed.
"Hookware”: The Melbourne Public
Library is about to re-open as I write. All
the' books have been removed to the new
rotunda, with the dome, behind the old
library. The reading-room is on the floor
of the rotunda, which has three galleries
around for book storage. About 30,000
books are accessible in the reading-room;
others must be applied for. Architect
Peebles designed this rotunda on the model
of Panizzi’s, at the British Museum. The
Melbourne one is octagonal, 115 ft. in dia-
meter, 114 ft. from floor to roof, with the
largest ferro-concrete dome in the world.
Its diameter is larger than St. Paul’s, in
London, 13ft. less than St. Peter’s at Rome,
and only 16ft. less than the largest in the
world, the Paris Pantheon. The weight of
the dome is 1800 tons; mostly it is con-
crete, though there are 148 tons of steel in
it. The lighting is by a central lantern of
30ft., with eight great windows. The read-
ing-room seats 368. Desks and chairs are
of Queensland silky oak, and the whole out-
fit of furniture, costing £4500, was made in
Australia. In the Melbourne library we
have 400,000 books already, and there is
accommodation for another million and a
half.
Mob weapons make an interesting study.
In the riots during the English railway strike
the popular, weapon was the bottle hurled
by hand, and it seems to have been so highly
effective that the troops were driven to reply
with bullets. In Wellington the other day
it was blue metal,, also projected by fist.
Away back in the Sydney strike of ’9O it
looked for a time as though the catapult was
likely to come into general use, and at
Dunedin this awkward toy scored one great
victory. Mounted troopers had cleared the
streets, and swept the mob before them like
chaff before a hurricane. They had just re-
assembled in triumph, when they were
attacked by a regiment of youths armed
with catapults, who projected such a bliz-
zard of glass marbles and iron panellings
the t the horses became unmanageable and
bolted, carrying their riders out of range
and into safety. The general impression was
that the riders were very grateful to the
horses. However, a straight intimation that
any future catapult blizzards would be met
with revolver bullets caused the sudden
abandonment of the weapon. Its possession
was a proof of premeditated violence, where-
as a piece of rock picked up anywhere might
plead sudden impulse. Also, once the rock
was thrown it left no tell-tale implement be-
hind it to ensure a sentence of six months
hard.
It is a wise Governor who knows when
to leave off his belltopper. Liverpool, of
Maoriland, lately got tired of
the cheerful guest who arrives
at top-hat functions wearing
sane headgear, and then pre-
tends to reel with astonishment
and dismay on finding that it
is an occasion for polished
head-tubes. His Ex., noticing
how frequent this sort of liar
was becoming, sent word ahead
on his next official tour that he
intended to leave his own
cylinder at home, and trusted
his hosts would do likewise.
M. V. Murphy, the Adminis-
trator of Norfolk Island —a
cheery official with a wholesome
contempt for his own top-hat—
tells a story of how the Excel-
lency of the day came down to
the island in a cruiser, and
how he and the other handful
of officials had a grave argu-
ment on the windy beach as to
the sort of dress they would
wear to receive the visitor. The
others reckoned it wasn’t safe
to put off without top-hats; but
Murphy looked at the tumbling
sea and the whaleboat, and de-
cided that it was a good occa-
sion for a tweed cap, and he
risked one accordingly. On the
way out, the leaping ocean
pelted the other men’s top-hats
with spray, and made them
worth about 9d. apiece. And
when at last the shore party
clambered aboard the ship, they
found that his Ex. had observed
Murphy’s unconventional tweed cap through
his glasses, and. approving of his choice,
had pulled a similar lid over his own head,
’hen the value of the storm-splashed cylin-
ders depreciated to nil, and the Pacific wind
howled triumphantly.
S.A. Supreme Court has given a sensible
decision in the divorce suit of a woman who
did not come into court with a stainless
Record herself. Her husband left her in
IJO2, to live with another woman. In 1905
she,, too, took another partner, who, how-
ever, died in 1908. Was 'this to bar her
divorce claim in 3913? The Court said No,
ruled that whatever she might have done
was the husband’s own fault, and decided to
help “an erring wife to return to the paths of
virtue” by setting her free.
HE HATED TO BE DISOBLIGING.
LANDLORD : “ What! Leaving so soon, Air. Coughlon? Weren't yer comfortable?”
MR. COUGHTON : "Oh, yes, comfortable enough. The tucker and bed were all right, and
I didn't mind the fleas, but I really couldn’t spare the blood."
The limit was reached at a recent Mel-
bourne wedding, when a bulldog was intro-
duced in the capacity of bridesmaid, or best
man, or something of the kind. Anyhow,
the tyke was to have occupied a conspicuous
position in the ceremony. He was dressed in
a white satin coat with silver fringe, a white
satin rosette at the base of his tail, and a
white satin pom-pom on each ear. He
was the bride’s “purp”—a particularly
hideous brand of brindled bull, with a breast
like an old-fashioned bureau, and out-turned
legs en suite. Unfortunately the officiating
clergyman had conscientious objections to the
introduction of so marked a doggy element
into the sacred ceremony, and struck; so
Carlo was led out, and had his attention
diverted by a cat. When the parson had
performed his office the gay dog was, how-
ever, restored to his proud eminence, and
thereafter was the most ornamental feature
of the festival. Every dog has his day, and
that was Carlo’s day.
The inter-State P. and O. passenger who
endures the cold stare of the long-distance
dukes and their devoted tip-slaves, the
stewards, never suspected how important he
was till the London directors remarked that,
if he was to be spirited away from their
black-labor liners by the Federal Navigation
Act, the whole business would be unprofit-
able. It is pointed out by the lamenting
directors _ that the long-distance duke or
squatter is ridiculously scarce ; consequently,
the humble inter-Stater is required to keep
the line moving and the brass buttons of the
underpaid officer in a proper condition of
dazzle. It is an affecting revelation; still
there doesn’t seem to be any reason why
Australia should neglect its growing mercan-
tile marine in order to keep the Lascar’s
shirt-tails fluttering round the coast. And,
anyhow, the tears are only directors’ tears,
and anyone knows how much real brine they
contain. As. a general rule, a co. with a weep-
ing Board is the safest investment going; a
Board only learns to weep with abandon
when the co. is safely bedded in accumulated
riches and the outlook is rosy. It’s the new
co., with slender prospects and no money,
that is filled with brassy self-confidence and
jov.
“Gordon G.” : Apropos the old Swan Ilill
(Vic.) courthouse just demolished (B.
23/10/’l3). Captain Crawford Pasco —son
of the man who gave the “England expects”
signal at Trafalgar—was the first P.M. For
four years he was a wise sultan over a dis-
trict of some 250 miles. His pet hobby was
to exhibit Nelson’s telescope—the one which
on a famous occasion he applied to his blind
eye. A later lord over the court was Dr.
Gummow, surgeon, parson, coroner and
general panjandrum. He was in command
when the Burke and Wills party passed
through, and entertained the crowd from
September 6 to September 12, 1860. Being
genial and sporting, he made the festivities
exceedingly joyful—so joyful, in fact, that
one of the members of the expedition wound
up by falling on to the bosom of'a teetotal
constable, who promptly availed himself of
the opportunity of marking his disapproval
of the whole affair by running the festive
gentleman in. On the inevitable morning
after, the culprit was haled before the
Court —obviously in a weak state of health.
Dr. Gummow was on the bench. A plea of
guilty was entered. The Court habitues—
and everybody was an habitue in those days
—conferred among themselves; odds were
freely given and taken about the sentence,
and as to whether the Doctor would place
his duty to the Law before his duty to his
guest. But this Solomon did both. To
assuage the feelings of the Law he sen-
tenced the misdemeanant to six hours, and,
in the same breath, stuck fast to the laws
of hospitality by ordering a large bottle
of champagne and various eatables to be
conveyed to the prisoner wherewith to be-
guile the time. The records show that some
fierce correspondence ensued between the
Doctor and the Attorney-General’s depart-
ment, the latter resolutely refusing to pay
the subsequent account. Gummow retired
from the conflict, undismayed; and a few
months later, as president and governing
director of the local hospital, he got the
account passed for payment there. Then
he drained his glass in honor of the At-
torney-General, the local John Hop,
the explorers, and the cause of all the mis-
chief, and settled himself to prepare for his
next joke.
LIFE’S SIX-DAY RACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Mr. J. Joynton Smith, M.LC., dropped the
idea of running the six days’ race, owing to the fact
that the most prominent riders could not be obtained
from abroad, cyclists regarded the event as off for
this season. There is still hope of the race being
run, however. —Daily paper.
There is still hope! Of course! There always is!
Around Life’s Six-Day Track we reel and whiz ;
From Monday morn to Saturday’s last; gleam,
We pedal swiftly in a sweating team.
From light to shadow, and from dark to light,
We wheel upon our solitary flight,
With click of pedals and loud, warring cries
if hen someone wobbles. Our sleep-weary eyes
Are bent upon the track that runs away
Beneath our wheel-rims, smooth, and sleek, and grey.
One drops behind—another makes the pace.
We may not lag upon this Six-Day Race ;
The most the tired may do upon this track
Is just to trail forlornly at the back.
Grim humor this ! From rise to set of sun,
The Six-Day Race is always being run.

When the policy is “To Hell with agree-
ments !” it is just as well to have a good
upstanding agreement ready to send on the
journey. Thus, the waterside workers at
Wellington (M.L.)-, who are out on strike,
made an agreement last year -with the em-
ployers, of which this was part:—
The essence of this agreement being that work shall
always proceed in the customary manner, and shall
not on any account whatsoever be impeded, it is agreed
that if any dispute or difference shall arise between
the parties bound by this agreement, every such dis-
pute or difference shall be referred to a committee to
be composed of three representatives of the union and
three representatives of the employers for their deci-
sion. The decision of the majority shall be binding,
and if no decision is arrived at, the committee shall
submit the point in dispute to some independent per-
son, to be chosen by it, and if his decision is not
acceptable to both parties, then the matter shall be
referred for further negotiation to the Maoriland
Federation of Labor and the employer or employers
concerned.
That was a real clinking agreement to pass
along to the Devil, and to the Devil it
accordingly went.
Parramatta, which has been celebrating its
125th birthday, ranks really as the oldest
town in Australia. It got its first name,
Rosehill, even before Sydney was christened.
Sydney never was christened in a formal
way. Governor Phillip called the inlet Syd-
ney Cove,- and from that the town got its
name haphazardly. The Historical Records
show that Phillip and his officers dated their
despatches from “Sydney Cove, Port Jack-
son,” till June, 1790, after which they be-
gan to drop the “cove,” at first occasionally,
then altogether. Phillip intended to for-
mally name the town on June 4, 1788, the
King’s birthday, so he said; but he never
did it. Dr. White in his journal says that
his Ex.’s intention was to call the town
Albion. Rosehill was so named by Phillip
on November 2, 1788. according to Collins,
but on King’s birthday—June 4, 1791 —
he altered it to Parramatta. For a
while —perhaps even before it was called
Rosehill —it was the Crescent.
Observe the workings of the young
Australian mind. A St. Kilda school-
boy, asked to name the most temperate
country in the world, replied: “Iceland,
because there are no snakes there.”
This week’s ecclesiastical note: —
That portion of ecclesiastical Australia which is of
a sporting turn of mind has been excited at the
prospecc of seeing an Archbishop and a Bishop peel
off their gaiters and have a set-to in public. So far
the meeting has not taken place, probably owing to
some trouble as to the gate-money; but the pre-
liminaries were exciting.
it happened this way. The Brotherhood of the
Good Shepherd is an Anglican “Bush Brotherhood,’’
with headquarters at Dubi.o (N.S.W.), and with mem-
bers working arid portions of the vineyard round
Wanaaring and Hungeriord, where the ordinary cleri-
cal laborer doesn’t venture. Once a year the Brothers
make a “campaign” in Sydney to hold up the pros-
perous city church member and make him shell out
something for the lean men on the track. The Bro-
thers are alleged to be “High” Church. “High and
crazy, Low and lazy,” is an old Anglican saying, and
the “Low” Anglican clergy keep it up by concentrat-
ing in Sydney. Late Archbishop Smith, though a
“Low” churchman, was no party man, and both pre-
sided at the Brothers' meetings and subscribed to
their support. But Archbishop. Wright has “vest-
ments” on the brain, and shies at the sight of a
chasuble. Some of the Brothers don’t wear the
offending vestments, ' but some do; wherefore the
Arch, will have nothing to do with them. Last year
he would not welcoipe to the Cathedral the Rev.
J. O. Feetham, then principal of the Brotherhood,
now Bishop of North Queensland. Governor Chelms-
ford reckoned this was over the odds; he didn't go
much on vestments himself, but he had been outback,
and knew that, whatever opinion the average bush
worker has of parsons in general, he has always a
good word for the Brothers, who are “blokes” like
himself. So Chelmsford started going elsewhere to
church. Just as Sydney was beginning to lay its ears
back for scandal, the Arch, invited Feetham to
preach, “as Mr. Feetham, not as principal of the
Brotherhood.” Then Chelmsford returned to the fold.
This year, Dr. Long—the hefty young Australian
of 39, who bishes at Bathurst, and has charge of the
districts where the Brothers work —scented danger
from afar. The Sunday having been fixed on which
the Brothers were to visit Sydney, Long intimated
several months beforehand that he would like to
preach in Sydney Cathedral that day. The sugges-
tion was accepted with alacrity. Then he casually
hinted that, as the Brothers would be in Sydney then,
he proposed to preach about them and their work.
The Archbishop scented danger, and soon the fat was
in the fire. Long thereupon came down and stumped
Sydney for the Brotherhood. Desperate efforts were
made to persuade Long to ask for the Cathedral for
an afternoon service, when the wealthy Cathedral con-
gregation would not be there ; but he wasn’t taking
any, and an emissary from high places to the Brothers
who wear vestments, promising them “substantial
supnort” if they would discard their glad rags, also
failed. A Sydney paper got wind of what was going
on, and reported some extracts from one of Bishop
Long’s sermons, which, though carefully' veiled, made
joyful reading for those in the know. The nearest
Long got to bare knuckles was at a public meeting,
when, after a panegyric on Feetham. he declared that
“if any bishop said that because he did not agree with
John Feetham in everything he would have nothing
to do with him, that bishop would be a cad.” Syd-
ney Anglicans so enthusiastically declined to follow
Archbishop Wright’s lead that the Brothers had the
most successful Sydney campaign on record, and went
back rejoicing, with over £2OO of the best, as well
as a horse and trap and a motor-cycle.
Meanwhile, clerical circles are chuckling over an
incident of the campaign. The Brothers visited the
principal boys’ and girls’ schools, and at one of the
latter the Brother who did the talking was struck ov
the enthusiasm of a flaxen-haired little maiden, who
missed none of the points, and rapturously applauded
him. He asked the school-ma’am who she was.
“Don’t you know?” was the surprised reply. “That’s
Archbishop Wright’s little girl!’
SLOW.
S HE: “I thought you were going to hiss me when you puckered up your lips then."
H E: "N-no. It was a piece of grit got in my mouth.”
SHE: “Then for goodness sake swallow it —you need some."
A fire in a wood-working establishment at
Wellington (M.L ) last week brought to
light the knowledge that, while workers
along the waterfront were on strike, others
in the woed-turning business were engaged
making hundreds of good, solid, ironbark
batons for the use of the special constables
who were “dealing with” the strikers. Thus
the brotherhood of man gets another adver-
tisement, and the unity of Labor is estab-
lished at the old address.
AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT.
COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE (to client who has been dozing during the verdict): "IVake
up and get out. You're acquitted !”
THE ACCUSED: “Lor' lumme. Wot! Not Guilty?”
Justice seems to be having a rough pas-
sage in the shopping suburb of Prahran
(Vic.). The bench there pretty often con-
sists of five Jay pees—and three of the five
are the mortal enemies of the other two.
The two are understood to be bound by a
solemn oath to cling together and kick the
judicial shins of the three at every possible
opportunity. The three, on the other hand,
exist only to thwart and annoy the two. To
this extraordinary tribunal is brought the
harassed woman who hasn’t seen her kids to
school, and, if she is lucky, the feud on the
bench is blazing up so cheerfully that she can
objurgate the two and escape any conse-
quences, because the majority of the Court
refuses to do anything but listen unmoved.
Lately a sharp-tongued lady took advantage
of the situation to call one of the devoted
pair “an insulting, dirty brute.” And she
wasn’t even made to apologise. The Jaypee
may deserve to be spoken to in this fashion ;
still The Bulletin has a suspicion that re-
spect for law, not to speak of justice, isn’t
improved by the irregular proceeding.
* * * *
Melbourne’s chief human mystery just now
is Frederick O’Neill, the racing identity,
who, having got into holts with certain per-
■sons on several occasions, the other day
strolled into court, planked down the full
amount of the verdicts in ready cash, and
departed smiling as though he had won a
bet. Later he was fined for carrying on en
illegal betting-by-post industry. Also, he
had his bookmaking license confiscated, a
misfortune which drove him to turn profes-
sional backer. Not the least astonishing
thing about him was the fact that he made
this business pay. As a final blow, on the
eve of the Flemington meeting the Melbourne
police charged him with having no lawful
visible means of support, and, on his failure
to appear personally, asked for a warrant
for his arrest. His lawyer said that 12
months ago O’Neill was worth £27,000, that
he still possessed £6OOO, and that he was in
Sydney—though the police took their oath
that he had gone to Perth (W.A.) under an
assumed name. The question that agitates
the community is, What is the matter with
O’Neill, anyhow 7 And if it is anything
serious, where is the sense in accusing him
of being on his uppers, when, as a matter
of notorious fact, that sort of man hardly
ever is on his uppers?
“Billy B.” : I read this in a departmental
report the other day :
A prolific source of trouble in respect to the
health of female telephone exchange candidates
appears to he the lack of proper attention to the
teeth. In a batch of 40 recently, no fewer than
27 were reported as requiring attention to teeth
before their appointment to the Seivice would be
justified.
Now I know why her bright smile haunts
me still.
The higher courts will be called upon
shortly to decide the tangled problem whether
a slot machine which hands out certain goods
is the agent of the owner of the goods within
the meaning of the N. S. Wales Sunday-trad-
ing and early-closing laws. An enterprising
Australian firm recently struck the idea of
making such machines to sell matches and
cigarettes, and amongst other places they
were set up on the Manly boats.
The waterside shopkeepers have been
kicking ever since, and announcing in
a loud voice that a machine which
sells after hours and on Sundays is
an immoral institution; and, apparently as
n result of this agitation, a test prosecution
of the owner of the machines for Sunday-
trading was brought before the lower court.
The prosecution argued that, as the owner
nut the goods into the machine for sale, and
received the cash for them, he must he re-
sponsible for the Sawbath-breaking which
occurred every time a smoke-hungry
citizen used the machine on Sunday; but
after hearing the defence reason that per-
sons who used the machine might be guilty
of an offence, but that the owner who merely
put the machine up for a convenience at
ordinary days and hours Could not be re-
sponsible for their offence, the magistrate
dismissed the information. So the matter is
to go higher, to the glory of Costs; and if
the argument of the prosecution is main-
tained every penny or shilling-in-the-slot gas.

himself an outlaw and a Sabbath-breaker
within the meaning of the Act; while, if it
is decided that the machines may continue-
their ungodly courses, someone may hit on,
the idea of a thrum-in-the-slot beer machine-
which will solve the problem of the closed!

THE CHANGING WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To wear the new draped skirt, as their designer
intended they should be worn, it is essential to flop.
Though the picture of a woman slouching along with
slightly bent knees and head out does not sound very
sensible, there are some who will stop at nothing
where fashion is concerned. —Racing fashion note.
They change their shape from year to year ;
Soft mysteries are lost, or added ;
Where once she curved she now falls sheer ; '
Her waist is closer to her ear.
Has she got thin, or was she padded?
Discover, if you can, where she
Has altered her sweet self so greatly !
Are corsets all the mystery?
A languid air, a bended knee,
These are the tricks she’s mastered lately.
Within, the main essential girl
Remains intact. Outside the plotter
Has changed. There’s not one single cmj
To show where last year’s dearest pearl
Merged into this year’s turkey-trotter.
Thev are a very plastic sex :
Of clothes they need excessive rations ;
No passing fad their witchcraft wrecks ;
Man sadly passes in his checks
And wonders how she meets the fashions.

out bad smells and other nuisances, he
makes a hobby of bowls, and there isn’t a
balder-headed or more “sporting” enthusiast
on the greens in Sydney.
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
The Mayor proposed the toast of the Panama Com-
missioners. Mr. Alva Adams, in responding, said
had Great Britain sent to America a Governor like
George Reid —a man with his statesmanship, his
heart and his high sense of justice—perhaps America
might to-day have also been an English colony.
Press report.
George Reid says he is happiest in his
pyjamas, and has received deputations and
interviewers attired in those unconventional
garments. A man is, no doubt, justified in
studying his own comfort; but a High Com-
missioner surely ought to be careful about
setting a fashion in loose habits.
Addressing Melbourne University Stu-
dents, George Feed dropped at least a dozen
references to his innards into a half-hour
speech. After talking persiflage for a few
minutes, he turned to more serious matters,
explaining the change by stating that he
wasn’t giving an “after-dinner” speech. “You
have not offered me a dinner,” he said sadly.
Later, he recalled that he had gone without
lunch in order to be present. Every topic
he got on to led back to his stomach. “I make
better use of the food I eat than any of you
do,” he said, with evident pride. In other
respects George is little changed. His
monocle, however, is notable by its absence.
He now wears spectacles.
Retiring in December, after 49 years of
service, James Conway, best known of N. S.
Wales public-school teachers, one time of the
Training College, now at Cleveland-street.
He is not due to go out for another 12
months, and probably would not had he got
what he considered fair treatment. The
trouble seems to be that, though for two
years past High School work has been car-
ried on at Cleveland-street, no High School
salaries have gone that way. The N. S.
Wales Education Department seems to be
losing or driving away some of its brightest
men. From Cleveland-street one of the staff
goes in January as Lecturer in History and
English at the Victorian Naval College;
another has just taken charge of the lower
school at Newington, and a couple more are
moving out shortly.
AN UNWEECOME RESURRECTION.
William McMillan, being of opinion that the selec-
tion ballot for a Liberal candidate for Willoughby
was illegally conducted, has decided to contest the
seat independently. His action is universally con-
demned. — Liberal press.
THE OLD LADY (between gasps): “Wot! Not
really dead? An' ter think of all th' lovely
things we've jest bin saytn ’ about yer at

Maoriland’s best-known police magis-
trate, Dr. McArthur, has entered his plea
before the Last Court. He was a kind-
hearted man, who ran his job on broad,
human lines. Fifty-eight years ago he was
born in Glasgow, but his schooling was done
in Melbourne, where he took his M.A. and
LL.D. degrees. Then he put in some years
teaching in South Aus. and Maoriland, be-
fore turning to the law, which he did in
1898, at Auckland (M.L.). His staunch
friend, Richard Seddon, induced him to take
a seat on the Bench of Magistrates, at Wel-
lington, in 1901, and he was senior S.M.

Westralian goldfields are to have an An-
glican Bishop, to be started off on cash
mostly cadged in England. Archdeacon
Collick, of Kalgoorlie, is spoken of as the
first man for the job. He came from Eng-
land a good many years ago, and except for
one short period has been on the fields since
early Coolgardie days—so long, in fact, that
he is now quite a good, broad-minded
Christian. If he does take the billet
someone will have to sit on the diocese’s
cash-box, otherwise he will probably rifle it
some day to relieve a distressed family or
give his charges, the local aborigines, an
extra blanket or a Christmas dinner.
On “The Oldest Inhabitant’s” authority:
Roy Moffitt King, whose wedding with the daugh-
ter of H. A. Preston “Vandorian” has just told us
about, is a great-grandson of William Moffitt, one
of the most interesting of early-day Sydney traders.
In 1826 he established himself in a weatherboard shanty
in King-street as a bookbinder and stationer. Soon he
turned into Pitt-street, where Penfold’s are now, and
continued there until his death. Three daughters
—he had no sons that I know of—were rich when
he died. “Bill” Moffitt did not aspire to country
houses and kerridges ; he lived and died over his shop.
When George Frederick Bowen took up the Govern-
ment of Queensland and found 7j)d. in the safe—N. S.
Wales had collared all the -coin—Moffitt advanced the
impoverished new colony a quarter of a million, and
told them if they wanted any more they might ask
for it. Moffitt’s amusements in late life were few ;
a “cuffer” with his old pal, Captain Watson, of
Trafalgar Lodge, Castlereagh-street—he who gave the
Cook statue to Randwick—was about the limit of his
pleasure-seeking. After business hours, seated in his
Pitt-street doorway, he watched and mused over the
crowds which passed to and fro. He was the first
man in Sydney to put plateglass windows in his shop-
front, and to place flagstones on the footway. The
flagstones were good ones ; they are there still.
Flouting the policy of encouraging Aus-
tralian talent, and stifling the sect’s own
college, the Melbourne Collins-street Church
of the Hardshell Faith resolves to import
Pastor T. G. Ruth from England. A stu-
dent of Bristol College, and pastor of a
Liverpool chapel, this delicate young man
made, it seems, a great impression with a
recent speech in the Leeds Town Hall, and
was thereupon recommended by Spun - , a
recent, and Carey, a former, pastor, now in
England.
James Nangle, who succeeds the late J.
W. Turner as Superintendent of Technical
Education in N. S. Wales, has been more
or less connected with the department for
23 years, in divers positions, from teacher
of geometrical drawing in a suburban school
onwards. He “served his time” as a car-
penter and joiner, polished up his practical
bench-work at the Technical College evening
classes, became a clerk of works, then an
architect, and among other places designed
Marcus Clark’s big fluff emporium near
Sydney Railway Station. He is a Fellow
of the Royal Astronomical Society (Eng.),
a member of a kitful of similar learned
bodies, has written a book on building prac-
tice, and, as he is only 44 years old, has
still time to learn a good many of the things
he doesn’t know about modern educational
methods and the organisation of a big de-
partment.
An energetic citizen is
James Marion, general sec-
retary of the N. S. Wales
Water Waggon party, now
winding itself up for the
local-options battle. Thirty-
four years ago he was born
at Millicent, in the south-
east garden of South Aus.,
and such schooling as was
available to him ended when
he was 11. Then he started to
hustle for a living with a
hammer and a pile of road-
metal. At 17, his muscle
development had advanced
him to the pick-and-shovel
profession, and he qualified
as D.D. (polite for drain-
digger). From that he
moved on to farming jobs,
all the time accumulating such brain
food as he could obtain, until, when he
was 26, he reached Sydney to start on the
real work of his life—social reform. In the
job of pouring scorn and fried language on
the drink devil he has since left marks in
Victoria, Maoriland and N. S. Wales. In
fact, any unusually large dust column may
be suspected of being caused by Bro. Marion
pursuing the old enemy with a whirling and
tireless pump.
If the movement succeeds, and John Mad-
den is appointed Governor of Victoria, he
won’t be the first ex-politician of these parts
to become his Excellency. Weld, who had
been a Maoriland politician—Premier for
some time —was appointed Governor of
Westralia, and afterwards of Tasmania, but
not of the State in which he had done his
political fighting. In fact, when the Colonial
Office decided to reward him with a Gov-
ernorship, it was thinking of some place as
far away as Hong Kong or the Gold Coast;
but, no vacancy offering there, it ran him
into the first job that was available.
Another Bishop Thornton yarn—this one
from “Norbell” :
My father was a Presbyterian, but as he owned the
best horses and buggy at Mount Rouse (Vic.), he
was approached by a deputation of Anglicans and
asked to drive Bishop Thornton over from the rail-
way at Dunkeld, 18 miles away, on the occasion of
the prelate’s first visit to that portion of his diocese.
The old man had his four-in-hand out for the trip,
and duly met the Gaiters at the Dunkeld railway sta-
tion. He conducted him to the turnout, which was
waiting at the pub opposite, and took the ribbons.
But his Grace (or whatever it is) wasn’t quite
ready. “Will you excuse me for a moment,” he said,
“vvhile I go in and have a glass of beer?” “Cer-
tainly,” said dad. Presently his Nibs came out and
took his seat. “All ready?” asked the old man.
“Yes,” said, his Reverence. “Then,” said my dis-
respectful parent, “would you mind holding the reins
a moment while I go in and have a glass of beer?”
And he left his Lordship sitting in the cold for about
half an hour, and then came out wiping his mouth.
“Now,” said he, “we’ll make a start.” The honor of
Scotland was vindicated.
The newly-elected Mayor of N’York, John
Mitchell’s grandson, is more or less con-
nected with Australia, inasmuch as his
grandfather was a former Tasmanian resi-
dent, and sailed in 1853 from Sydney for
Honolulu en route for America, where he
made his home. Attorney-General Irvine,
K.C., is a cousin of his, Irvine’s mother
having been a sister of John Mitchell. The
latter was tried in 1848 in Dublin for trea-
son-felony, and sentenced to 14 years’ trans-
portation. He was first at Bermuda.
Then a shipload of convicts, including Mit-
chell, were sent from Bermuda to the Cape.
But the people of the latter place would not
have them, though they were prepared to
make an exception in Mitchell’s favor. From
the Cape they came to Hobart Town, and
there Mitchell was liberated on parole. 'He
lived at Naut Cottage, Bothwell, where his
family joined him. In 1853 he resigned his
narole, and. after many dangers, reached
Sydney, under the name of Warren. After
waiting three weeks “Mr. Warren” and
family got passages in the Orkney Lass for
Honolulu, and so reached the United States.
Mitchell, who was a solicitor by profession
and a journalist by instinct, followed the
Inky Way in the States.
Hied in England, while on long leave
Edward J. Smith, Deputy-Commissioner of
Stamps in N.S.W. since 1889. Johnson, the
Commissioner, is about 70, and has been ex-
pected to retire at any time for the last fiv
years; so considerable reconstruction is dn t
in the Stamp Duties office. The deceased
Deputy was a great cricketer in his
days, and up to the last took a lively intern?
in the sport.
CHIEF JUSTICE
CULLEN
(N.S.W.).
The septuagenarian Rowland H. Ducker.
recently deceased in Sydney, left property
valued at £71,362. His father, John Ducker,
had been an array officer who took to store-
keeping at Richmond (N.S.W.) in the
’forties of last century. The son. who suc-
ceeded him, had his own way of doing busi-
ness. For instance, if a customer sent in
an order and he found items which he
thought the customer could do without or
could not afford, he simply wouldn’t supply
the goods. By will he left a moderate
amount for Methodist church purposes, but
the bulk of the fortune goes to an only
daughter.
Bishop Thornton, for many years of Bal-
larat, is a duplicate of Bishop Barker, of
Sydney, in some respects. Both were
scholars and impassioned evangelists in the
ranks of the junior clergy in England, but
in later life slackened down to humdrum fat-
ness. In his young days, Thornton, not
satisfied with his pulpit, went on to the
streets of London, and was twice arrested
by the police ; Barker’s attempts to w r in the
“mob” were similarly sensational. Both
worked with pen as well as tongue. Thorn-
ton, whose father was on London Times,
gave better promise as a writer than as a
speaker, and Barker better as a scriptural
interpreter than as an administrator. In
Australia, however, they quite reversed their
old habits, and stood for the proprieties every
time. Finally, to complete the likeness,
Barker remarried at 70; while Thornton, at
7S, takes a new bride.
The Lloyd stock has prospered in N. S.
Wales. George Alfred Lloyd retires at 70
from the post of Chamber Magistrate at the
Glebe. Ordinarily a man retires from the
Public Service at 65, but if certified to pos-
sess special faculties he can stay on till 70.
George acquired his certificate, of course.
His father, a Londoner, bought gold dust
from diggers in the ’so’s, and built up a tidy
fortune. He was also Sydney’s best-known
knock-’em-down auctioneer. Taking to poli-
tics, he beat Jimmy Martin for Newcastle,
and was P.M.G., Minister for Mines and
Treasurer. His sons stuck to Government or
quasi-Government billets._ His namesake,
the young man of 70, is accounted for.
Another, U T. Lloyd, was official assignee
till his death a few years ago. And still
another, C. F. W. Lloyd, is a busy member
of the Insolvency Court. The old gold-buyer
was, however, the most striking one of the
stock. His auctioneering was in its day
unique.
A MATTER OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO KELLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Kelly said it had been predicted by his friends
when he conceived the idea of entering political life
10 years ago that he would be a target for abuse,
and that the country could get on very well without
him. With truth he could say that he had never
regretted the step he had taken.— Extract from tri-
umphal speech made recently by Cook’s Young Man,
at Bondi Junction.
A fine thing now for a bright young man is a Serious
Purpose in life;
It isn’t enough to own motor-ears, and to have a
successful wife;
The friends of Kelly meant well by Kelly, for they
knew all the Kelly tricks,
When they begged of Kelly to just be Kelly, and
keep out of politics.
But Kelly’s hobby was booming Kelly, and he saw
where the big ad. lay;
So he looked as ponderous as he could and he
solemnly stepped that way ;
He hasn’t regretted it since, he says, and I think
what he says is true;
The rise of Kelly seemed great to Kelly, though it
may not seem much to you.
If Kelly’s contented with what he’s got, why, nobody
will object;
The fate of Kelly, to all but Kelly, and some of the
Very Select,
Who prophesied Kelly would come to eggs, doesn’t
matter a tinker’s Oh !
To realise all it means to Kelly, you have to be
Kelly, you know !

The ’Asia’s head office is in London, and the accounts
have the dried burrs of last season on them when they
arrive back in the land where most of the com-
pany’s money is made. The Bulletin would like
the ’Asia better if the accounts didn’t have to do this
voyaging—if, in short, the bank’s home were here
and the profits were mostly distributed in the country
where they are made. Still this paper couldn’t dis-
guise its admiration for this bank even if it wanted
to. The ’Asia is a great institution, well handled—
paying its rank and file no more than it should, of
course, and sometimes less than it might, yet doing,
on the whole, better than most English-owned banks
even in that respect.
When the boom smash happened 20 years ago the
Bank of Australasia winced, maybe, but it didn’t
suspend payment. It didn’t even suspend
dividends. That was a great advt., and there
are not many institutions that gain more from
a good advt. than a bank does. Like the rest, it
no doubt had a pile of depreciated securities on its
hands ; unlike many, it was in a position to bide its
time for realising those securities. Meanwhile, by
greatly reducing its dividend, it was able to use large
sums of current profit to write those securities down.
Then came Australia’s recovery after the great head-
ache-in-the-morning, and, backed by the country’s
marvellous resilience, prices mounted so much that
this bank recovered large debts which had been
written off, and sold foreclosed properties for sums
in excess of their written-down values. Some of
this unexpected profit may have been taken into Pro-
fit and Loss ; a good deal of it was more likely passed
without a word into internal reserves. At the same
time disclosed profits were used to write down the
office-property asset, until bank premises in Australia,
Maoriland and London stood, in April, at only
£21,626, and by this time the entry has probably
disappeared altogether—which means that the bank
has (say) £750,000 of an asset that doesn’t figure
in the books at all. This is another very tidy in-
ternal reserve. Add to that the bank’s big exchange
business, and it is no wonder that, calculated on capi-
tal and visible reserves, profits are big—for the half-
year under review no less than £ll 7s. 2d. p.c. p.a.
And those tall earnings go hand-in-hand with a
very strong cash position. Here are the balance-
sheet figures:—
April, 1912. April, 1913,
Notes., ~ £210,441 £188,472 Dec. £21,969

Premises .. 61,006 21,626 Dec. 39,380
Total liabilities to the public thus amount to
£21,454,978 ; and of that sum just on 40 p.c. is
in liquid securities. Further, compared with the
capital and visible reserves, the debt to the public
is comparatively small; there is only £5 17s. of the
public’s money in the business for every £1 of the
shareholder’s. This means remarkably good security
for the depositors and other creditors, and compara-
tively little risk for the shareholders. That it should
be possible to make such profits on so small a hold-
ing of public money, and with so much of that
money in cash and public securities and on deposit at
short notice, points to (1) exceedingly strong internal
reserves, and (2) an exceedingly valuable connec-
tion. Certainly it might conceivably mean rotten
securities, and a consequent high rate of interest, but
that alternative is out of the question in this case.

The United has got into the collar very satisfactorily.
It wasn’t too willing a worker once; it seemed to
have the old-fashioned idea that hustling wasn’t
quite the thing for a fire-insurance office that wanted
to be perfectly respectable. Between 1895 and 1905
(10 years) it increased its premium income by only
£30,110; in the past eight years it has added no
less than £68,709. Certainly there are lines avail-
able now that weren’t available till lately or only
in very limited quantities—accident insurance and
workmen’s compensation, for instance. Still that
isn’t wholly rcsnonsible. There was a time when
the office that was Australian didn’t stress that fact.
Most times, indeed, it shoved the fact as far into
the background as it could. Nowadays things are
different; and though there are a few that mention
the circumstance only in a whisper, as though it
were some reflection on their parentage, the majority
• —including in a mild way the United—stand upright
and appeal to Australia to help Australian institutions
• —institutions whose directors are here and are known,
whose investments are here and can be looked into,
and whose management can be talked to personally
in case the settlement of a claim isn’t quite up to
the mark.
For a long while the United’s paid capital was
£85,402; and when, in a couple of years, one-third
of that amount had been added to reserves after
paying a 12$ p.c. dividend, the directors thought
the shareholders deserved a little bigger bite. Then
they did a very prudent thing: instead of putting
up the dividend beyond 12$ p.c.—which is quite
conspicuous enough—they transferred £20,000 of
reserves to capital, and at the same time got in
enough new capital to bring the total up to
£120,000. There are now 40,000 issued shares of
£lO paid to £3—which, of course, means a £7
liability. In view of that liability shareholders will
remain much interested in the reserves, which are
the buffer between them and calls in case of any
very bad disaster. Fortunately the buffer is strong.
Theoretically, a year’s premiums are the amount cal-
culcated to cover an average year s losses aiter pay-
ing exes, and providing for interest on capital. Pre-
sent premium income, after deducting the exes.,
amounts to rather under £100,000; hence the
reserves alone are sufficient to pay nearly two years’
theoretical losses. As a matter of fact, they exceed
the losses of the worst three years the co. has had.
Here are the loss and other figures:—

The value of the reserves depends, of course, upon
the quality of the investments. Many a co. which
claims considerable reserves would find that it had
precious little more than its capital if it had to
realise its assets. In this case the deposits, net
cash and public securities represent £188.107.
Freeholds ( £72,244), mortgages ( £21,235) and de-
bentures other than Government ( £33,375) are the
other assets. Interest and rents brought in £lO,lll
last year—a shade under 3% p.c. on the average
funds invested. It is a low return; but, then, the
securities are mostly of the gilt-edged sort, and
while they don’t produce a high return, they are the
only sort that an insurance office ought to have any-
thing to do with. And even if the return is low,
the income from this source provided five-sixths of
the increased amount which the dividend called for
last year, permitting over 90 p.c. of the under-
writing profit to be laid aside for the further pro-
tection of the already well-protected policyholders.

In the beginning this was the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre
Co., with a capital of £170,000, formed to take
over the Australasian patents of the Dunlop tyre
people. For the goodwill £125,000 was paid, and
there were £lO,OOO worth of sundries. The
£135,000 was paid as follows:—In ordinary shares,
£70,000; in 7i p.c. non-cumulative pref. shares,
£20,000; in cash, £45,000. The public subscribed
£BO,OOO in 7 p.c. cum. pref. shares. The growth
of the business was very rapid, and more money
was soon wanted, the big cash payment having bitten
a large hole in the subscribed capital. First 88,000
more cum. pref. shares ( £1) and 20,000 ordinaries
(.£1) were issued, making the total capital
£278,000, and a subsequent £12,000 in cum. prefs.
brought the lot up to £290,000. The ordinaries
were not of the common variety. Mostly ordinaries
go on taking divs. up to any amount the profits can
stand. In this case it is the ordinaries that stop—
at 9 p.c.—while the prefs. go on feeding past their
7 and p.c. In 1911 it was reckoned that the
shares could stand some watering. This was obvi-
ously in the interests of the ordinary shares, which,
having reached their 9 p.c., could not otherwise get
any further benefits from the great prosperity of the
co. Further capital was also needed; and it was
decided that the best plan would be to reconstruct
the co. This was accordingly done. At that time
there were 180,000 cum. pref. and 20,000 non-
cumulative pref. shares. These 200,000 were given
200,000 cum. pref. shares in the new co. The
90,000 ordinaries (limited to 9 p.c.) were given
90,000 deferred non-cum. pref. shares. By way of
bonus 172,500 new ordinary shares were issued—
three for every four of the old pref. shares and one
for every four of the old ordinary shares. Then
,500 shares were offered at par—-one for every
four of the pref. shares in the new co. and one for
every 12 of the non-cumulative (old ordinary) shares.
The present capital is therefore made up as fol-
lows :—-
Cumulative pref. shares .. £200,000
Deferred non-cum. prefs. .. .. 90^000
Ordinary shares . . . , , , , . 230’000
Total £520,000
As mentioned just now, 172,500 shares ( £1) were
issued by way of a bonus. How this £172,500 was
made up was never fully explained. Nominally, after
paying the divs. to July, 1910, the reserves were
£61,878. There was no doubt a certain amount of
surplus profits, after paying the next year’s divs. ;
but how much wasn’t disclosed, no accounts being
issued for that 12 months. Assuming that the
surplus was £30,000, then a.total of about £BO,OOO
had to be found either from internal reserves or by
writing up assets, in order to provide the bonus".
Apparently, among other things, goodwill was
written up. As at July, 1910, “goodwill, trade
marks, patent rights, leases, etc.,’’ stood in the
books at £137,524. “Goodwill’’—plain -and un-
adorned—stands now at £lBO,OOO. There has evi-
dently been some watering there. Freeholds, which
in the old co. stood at “cost, less amounts written
off,” are now in “at valuation.” Probably some-
thing was also added there to help make up the
£172,500. v
Reserves are described in the table as nominal.
So far as tangible assets are concerned, there are no
reserves. Deducting the £lBO,OOO at which the good-
will paper-asset stands, there is indeed a big de-
ficit. Not that the Dunlop patents and business are
not worth money. They are, without a doubt, worth
at this moment a lot of money. But the Dunlop
patents are only an idea, after all; and one idea is
only good until a better comes along. Solid
tyres were good until pneumatics arrived ; and some
day something may arrive which will put pneu-
matics more or less out of the market. That
£lBO,OOO ought, therefore, to be written down out
of profits; in other words, the paper, which repre-
sents so much of the capital, should be gradually
superseded by hard cash or tangible assets. The
new capital, got in when the co. was reconstructed,
has put the co. into an easy financial position. On
mortgages and overdrafts it owes £42,895, to de-
positors £48,187, and on ordinary trade accounts
£16,066; total £97,148. On the other side, stocks
account for £295,820, and hook debts £89,591.
And there are properties and plant.
The “A” (cumulative pref.) shares rank as re-
gards capital and div. in priority to all other
shares. They are entitled to a first bite of 7 p.c.,
and to the profits divided after the “B” (non-
cumulative deferred pref.) shares have had 9 p.c.
and the “C” shares have had 10 p.c. The “A”
shares are entitled to 7 p.c. and the “B” shares to
9 p.c. before the ordinaries (“C” shares) get any-
thing. It takes £2OOO to pay the “A” shares 1
p.c.; so the surplus profits last year were sufficient
to pay these shares another 10i p.c. To pay “A”
and “B” shares their pref. divs. (7 and 9 p.c.
respectively) £22,100 is required; and a profit of
£45,100 is needed to pay the prefs. their div. and
give the ordinaries their 10 p.c. After that £45,000
goes out the cum. prefs. (“A”) score for the rest.

It would be a lot better for the country if this co.
hadn t recovered so fast. Its troubles began with the
boom of the late ’Bo’s and early ’9o’s; and that boom
was due to wild borrowing on the part of Govern-
ments, cos., and private individuals. Money (for
goods) poured into the country, and an artificial pros-
perity was created. Prices sailed upwards accord-
ingly, just as they have sailed upwards of late.
Then came the smash. It would have been
bad enough if the borrowing had merely
stopped; for everybody knows what difference it
makes to a household when its income is suddenly
cut down by (say) one-quarter. But in this case
not only was the borrowing stopped, because nobody
would lend, but the foreign lenders in thousands of
cases wanted their money back. A scramble fol-
lowed ; and, really for the protection of its best
friends, this co., like many another, suspended pay-
ment. Deposits were then “extended”: that is to
say, the co. said it would pay when the property
market settled down and it became possible to realise
without making disastrous sacrifices. Meantime the
shareholders got no dividend, and to make good some
of the depreciation in assets, shares were written down
from £lO to £3. This, of course, was mere book-
keeping. Properties having depreciated (say) £40,000
on paper, it was advisable to square things (also on
paper) by reckoning £40,000 of the capital as lost.
Tears of hard economy followed. Meantime the pro-
pel ties which had fallen into the co.’s hands were
nursed instead of being got rid of at the first spring
in the market. Then came Federation, Protection and
other alleged curses, and Sydney started to look up.
Good seasons followed. On top of good seasons came,
unfortunately, another wild borrowing boom, and
another period of inflated prices. Some of the fore-
closed properties the co. then got rid of; from the
others it derived, and still derives, rents more or
less commensurate with other boom prices. The co.,
re-valuing the remnant of its previously written-dowii
assets, and finding them worth much more than they
had been written down to, decided that it should re-
store its written-off capital. The £3 shares have
therefore been written up to £7, and now another
£1 is being added. During the past year the re-
valuation was extended to the co.’s office premises,
which were thereupon marked up from £6OOO to
£12,000. This adds nominally another £6OOO to
the reserves.
Six or seven years ago the co. resumed ordinary
business, and began taking new deposits, but verv
little has been done yet in that way. Of the present
total liabilities of £54,180, old fixed deposits repre-
sent £47,012 ( £11,016 of which belong to the
society) and only £6327 is on current account and
new fixed deposits. Its own present capital is
£66,705 ; and its own and the public’s money is
represented by these assets:—
Old mortgages £16,429
New ditto 38,969
Foreclosures .. ~ .. 72 812
Liquid assets and office premises ~ 23,016
Total assets .. ..£151,226
The co. has thus hung on to a very solid lot of pro-
perty. What returns it gets can’t be told exactly;
but interests and rents, from mortgages and pro-
perties, brought in £12,622 last year, which is over
8 p.c. on the average assets. But, through tying up
so much money in that way, it hasn’t the funds
available for new advance business; wherefore it sets
out now on a more vigorous campaign after new
deposits. No doubt money can be made that way ;
but a lot can also be lost. It depends on the margin
insisted on between the present market value and the
advance granted. It isn’t likely that there will be
any such smash in values as we had in 1892, because,
although borrowing must stop presently, there won’t
be the clamor for immediate repayment (which
means forced realisations) ; but the shock that will
follow the stoppage of loans and loan works will be
bad enough; and if a droughty year or two come
also, there will be a slump in Sydnev property
especially unimproved and outer-suburban property’
that will make many people feel very siok. ‘ ’

This concern was only a baby when it fell up to its
neck in the broth of the boom, and it isn’t out yet.
It bought suburban estates wholesale, and proposed
to sell them retail; but the boom burst, and ever
since then the co. has been paying rates and taxes
on properties that have been bringing in next to
nothing. When it suspended payment in 1892 it
owed depositors £178,369, and the bank £44,392.
The fumes of the great drunk being still in its head,
it compounded with its creditors by offering to pay
them 4i p.c. interest. Of course, that soon proved
to be out of the cruestion, and a rearrangement had
to be made; depositors were, under the new scheme,
to get 3 p.c., deposits were to be extended till 1918,
and no div. was to be paid till the old debt was
extinguished. For a good many years very little
progress was made: drought hovered around the back
country, and Brisbane wasn’t buying suburban allot-
ments. Six or seven years ago, however, things in
Queensland began to improve, helped very largely by
artesian boring in the wool country and fine prices
for all station products. Sales have, therefore, been
more numerous, and, assisted no doubt by repur-
chase of deposits at a discount, a good deal of the
old debt has been got rid of. This shows the move
ment in more detail:—

Since 1905 £14,500 of debt has been wiped out at
a cost of almost exactly the same amount (book
value) ot properties; and, besides, a trifle under
£3OOO in cash, etc., has been accumulated This
means, or ought to mean, that of late properties have
fetched book values and a bit over—or, anyway £1
of assets have got rid of a trifle more than £1 0 f
debt. But when odds and ends of estates are sold
it is a hard matter to say what their book value
really is. For instance, supposing there are 50
allotments in an estate worth (on paper) £lO 000
and 25 of them are sold, it doesn’t follow that the
other 25 would fetch £5OOO. The book value of the
25 allotments is thus a matter of estimation onlv
On the past eight years’ history the co.’s capital
and reserves should be intact ; but for the reasons
just given it doesn’t follow that 20s. in the £ will
be got for the property assets ; and if they don’t fetch
20s. in the £, then reserves and perhaps capital
will be cut into. The co. has shifted a lot of debt ■
but, all things considered, progress during the past
seven years of State prosperity hasn’t been fast. And
this suggests that the co.’s properties are still only
marketable in strict moderation. Yet it will be
surprising if the co. is able to do even as well during
the next seven years as it has in the past seven. To
those shareholders who hang on there should, never-
theless, be a very satisfactory return of capital in the
long run ; but whether the co. will ever do much
in the way of new business is now doubtfuL

“After providing for management expenses, repairs
and depreciation” profits are £2606. That being so,
the true profits may be understated ; that is, too much
may be written off for the wear and tear of ships, in
which case there is a hidden reserve somewhere about
the premises—which would certainly be very useful,
considering the midget size of the disclosed reserves.
On the other hand, too little may be allowed for wear
and tear of ships, and in that case the true profits
would be overstated, and the dividend would not be
earned. In any case, profits don’t seem to justify
the 7 p.c. As to the amount that is written off, this
may give some help:—

The £72,191 of ship property includes the new
steamer Benandra, to be launched next month, and
the £70,375 six months ago no doubt included some-
thing paid on account, though there was no mention
of it. Anyway, an increase of one new steamer and
only £lBl6 in the book-value of the fleet seems to
dispel any doubts as to whether sufficient allowance is
made for wear and tear—assuming, of course, that
no ships have meantime been sold or lost. The posi-
tion is, therefore, probably quite as good as it looks.
Of the six directors who were on the Board in 1905
only three remain. The other three, besides the pre-
sent general manager, are new blood, and the combi-
nation is pushing things ahead —and they needed
pushing very badly. Unfortunately, the South Coast
isn’t making much progress, so the material for them
to push isn’t of the best.

Building-society business has recovered to such an
extent in Melbourne, and probably deposit money has
been so hard to get, that during the year this society
decided to bring the capital up to £125,000. Con-
sequently 28,639 shares were offered at par (£1),
shareholders having the right to take them in propor-
tion to their present holding. As shares are quoted
at a solid premium (fully paids are worth 295. now),
there was no bloodshed. However, only 24,760 were
applied for, and 10s. a share was paid on each, mak-
ing the paid capital at the end of September
£108,732. Since then another ss. has been got in.
The County of Bourke is one of the many Melbourne
building societies that bit the dust after the smash
20 years ago. When a revaluation was made in
1898, of the £180,876 of alleged assets £62,725
was adjudged to be froth, and consequently the item
was cut down to that extent, leaving £118,151 on
the books. At the same time two-fifths of the
capital was written off; £10,532 of this went to-
wards forming a reserve, the rest to squaring up
the accounts. But things have improved since then,
as this, as well as the first table, will show: —

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-,
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,

tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to

inflated values* The most satisfactory feature is that
so comparatively little of the money lent out has been
borrowed by the society. More than three-fourths of
it is the society's own ; which means that, even if
there were a bad slump and a lot of securities were
thrown on the society’s hands, it would not have to
go in for wholesale sacrifices in order to raise enough
cash to satisfy depositors who, of course, always
choose that inconvenient time to want their money
back.
The promoters of The Mirror, Ltd., have
taken the advice which The Bulletin offered more
in sorrow than in anger (18/9/’l3), and have with-
drawn the old prospectus and issued a new one,
which is much better. Three objections were taken to
the old one. (1) The public, which was to put up
all the money, was to have only the same voting
power in the aggregate as the promoters, who put u(>
no money at all. (2) The promoters, who put up
no money, and took no risk, were to get two-thirds
of the profits after the public, which had put up all
the money and taken all the risk, had got a mere 8
p.c. (3) The managing director, besides getting
£5OO salary, was to receive 15 p.c. on the gross
advertising revenue. Amendments have been made
on all these three points. (1) The public, which is
asked to subscribe for 100,000 shares, is to get a
bonus of one “B” share for every 10 “A” shares
applied for. These “B” shares will come out of the
20,000 which the promoters were to take under the
first arrangement. This distribution of bonus shares
will give the public—nominally, at any rate —an easy
preponderance of voting power. (2) The distribution
of these bonus shares means, if the whole 100,000 “A”
shares are applied for, that the promoters disgorge
half of the profits they had reserved for themselves
under the old scheme. They now get one-third of
the profits in excess of 8 p.c. instead of two-thirds.
(3) The managing director is to get a minimum
salary of £5OO and 15 p.c. on the advertising
revenue, but he is to pay canvassers’ commission out
of it. Probably this was meant all along ; if so, it
was most clumsily put—and put so that the paying-
out could be evaded by the employment of an army
of canvassers on wages. It may, perhaps, be evaded
in the same way now: the clause is very indefinite.
In any case, the basis of remuneration is a bad
one. The managing director should conceivably be
paid a bonus on profits, but not on gross revenue.
Getting a commission on revenue, it will plainly pay
him to accept cut-rate advts., to the detriment of
the co., rather than turn the proposed contracts
down. Still, as remarked before, the changes are
all for the better. If the promoters hadn’t been so
greedy the co. would doubtless have gone off smartly.
As it is, a good proposition may be imperilled.
Broken Hill Block 14 made £12,589 last
half-year, £1294 of it coming from interest. After
deducting depreciation, etc., £10,344 net was left.
The pref. share “interest” absorbed £l5OO, and the
balance was available for dividend, in which prefs.
and ordinaries share alike. A shilling dividend re-
quired £lO.OOO. The surplus of more or less liquid
assets is still a solid £82,266 ; most of this is cash.
The co. is still poking around gouging out what
carbonates it can find in the upper levels. “There
is,” the directors say, “no reason to fear any
sudden drop in production, but the cost per ton of
mining is gradually rising as the ore bodies are
being depleted.” The mine, which is a failure at
the bottom levels, hasn’t enough sulphide ore to
justify the remodelling of the mill, so it sells its
output to the Junction North. There are probably
200.000 tons of this ore available, and, though
16,000 tons have been taken out during the half-
year, an equal amount or thereabouts has been
developed. The co has been looking for another
property, but hasn’t had much luck. The most
promising thing it got into was the Torrington, in
the New England (N.S.W.) district; but that has
been floated off, and on present appearances isn’t
going to make anybody’s fortune.

Great Cobar £5 shares went back last
week to 20s. 3d. The shadow of the annual report
must have been partly responsible for that gloom;
and on top of that fell a poor monthly return. The
co. is handling from 300,000 to 400,000 tons of low-
grade ore, returning approximately £500,000, per
annum. To June, 1912, its output for 12 months
was 6736 copper from 418,313 tons smelted; aver-
age 1.6 p.c., worth only 16s. (copper at £5O). It
was, however, promised that gold and silver values
would pull it out of the slough. But this promise
hasn’t been fulfilled, simply because those values
have shrunk. For instance, October gave 503 tons
copper, 16280 z. gold and 8841 oz. silver, so the
average was only 3.230 z. gold and l7oz. silver per
ton of copper. Total value, say £l5. Now, assum-
ing the copper extraction averaged 2 p.c. (50 tons
of ore per ton copper), the average value of precious
metals per ton of crude ore is only 6s. Values
altogether are so poor that costs have to be cut to
the bone to make the business pay anything at all
over debenture interest.
Occidental, near Cobar (N.S.W.), is try-
ing hard to regain the confidence of the share market.
The last fortnightly report is inspiriting, the average
assay value of 1322 tons of ore hauled having jumped
to 16dwt. 6gr. per ton. Some of the stopes yielded
much bevond expectations, the best assay (from No.
4 level) being 2oz. 13dwt. (229 tons). Face assays in
in No. 4, from which the bulk of the ore was drawn,
have been very variable, but all of the stuff won here
has been of high value. With regard to development,
winzing is to commence from the south end of the 1
shoot at No. 5 level, and a contract has been let to
continue the crosscut in search of No. 6 level. A
fair tonnage should now be available from the big
stopes; but shareholders must be prepared for lower
average values.
From Ardlethan: White Crystal is sink-
ing a new shaft, and has erected poppet heads. There
is a bit' of tin showing yet, but the co. makes no
attempt to raise any ore. The management is play-
ing a waiting game, and you’ll see a gamble later
on. Carpathia is keeping up its output. There s a
dividend or two in sight, and not much more.
Champion is putting an open cut into the hill, and
getting an occasional bit of ore. Ardlethan Options
are doing nothing, and have plenty to do it with.
Wildcat Cherry reports good “milling” stone. This
is evidently a misprint for “filling.” Anyway, they
must be stowing the “ore” below, as there s none
worth mentioning at grass. They have just com-
pleted a tank of 18.000yds., and the man who owns
the land should find it useful some day. Directors
are said to be negotiating for a battery, and that
ought to fetch ’em for a while. Homeward Bound is
a fair little mine—for a working party consisting
of an invalid and his infant son. The Southern
Cross tank (15,000vd5.) is completed; and a 10-head!
mill and other mining developments, such as manaj-
ger's cottage, are doing well. The cottage will also
come in handy for the agriculturist who owns the
land Their best chance was a drought, but the
absurd shareholders will expect a crushing now the
tank has water in it. At the Commonwealth, as
soon as the mullock and granite cut out, they should
be able to report an improvement in values. They
have a notice up: “Any person found taking ore
from this mine will be prosecuted,” but the penalty
for putting tin on to the mine is not stated. Out-
cast is leaving little tin to grow for the chap that
comes along in the next boom. At the Extended two
tanks are nearing completion, one of 4000yds., the
other of 8000yds. As soon as this is done they in-
tend to locate a site for the lode. At Bygoo nothing
much is doing since the options were turned down.
The Big Bygoo shareholders will soon have to take
their gruel. All the shows that didn’t float are full
of talk of what they missed. You ought to hear
them blaming each other: “I’d have sold it only for
you ”
* * * *
In spite of “bad times,” Lake View and
Oroya (W.A.) made a profit of £76,800 for the year
ended June 30, or about £55,000 more than was
earned in the preceding 12 months. Of the revenue of
£BO,OOO a shade over £60,000 was derived from
interest and dividends, £6OOO from retreatment of
Lake View residues, and £7OOO from Queen of the
Hills. Shareholders got 10 p.c. in place of the 5 p.c.
of the previous year, and £40,000 was transferred
to reserve, leaving a carry-forward of £4300. As
expenses absorbed only £3200, the co. cannot be
said to be expensively managed. During the year
over £lOO,OOO was expended on mining properties
or in the acquisition of additional interests, while
calls on shares mopped up £7200. Of this outlay
£35,000 was provided by sales. A full list of the
co.’s holdings and interests is given in the report,
and there are some remarks by T. J. Hoover on the
various shows in which the co. is interested. From
these it appears that the Queen of the Hills is shap-
ing well, the Mountain Queen making fair profits, and
the Oroya Leonesa barely paying expenses. At the
date of the balance-sheet the cash assets exceeded
the liabilities by only £6OOO, though the final 5 p.c.
dividend required £lB,OOO.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) has paid its ss.
div., and is now making a fresh onslaught on the
bears by reports of fair values in the bottom levels.
For all that, prices are high. In December last ore
reserves were estimated at about four years’ supplies,
and the profit 10s. or 11s. per ton. Yet ex dividend
shares are quoted at 50s. Some rich developments
at depth have certainly been reported since Decem-
ber, but the net value of these would not bridge half
the gap. Working profits have averaged under £4OOO
per month for the expired portion of the current
year ; but the dividend absorbed nearly all this, and
administration expenses, depreciation and instalments
and interest due on the co.’s big debenture debt had
still to be provided for.
* * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) has practically
made up its mind to complete its option on the
Yerilla King, but a final decision will not be arrived
at for a few weeks. The property has been worked
off and on for the last eight years, and has produced
about £16,000; the average value has been about
£4 per ton, though the last two crushings, treated
since the option was taken, have returned only 51s.
According to figures given locally, the Ridge’s pre-
sent mine has yielded £548,300 and paid over
£140,000 in dividends. It was at its best in 1910-
11, when the monthly output was about £6500 and
the profit £3OOO. Then returns began to dwindle,
and now that all the accumulated residues have been
treated the monthly yield averages £4OOO and the
profit £5OO. A further reduction is certain before
long.
Lake View and Star is elated over devel-
opments in the bottom workings of the Old Lake View
mine. Last year a winze was started from the 19th
level. For some distance values were poor; but
better stuff was met with lower down, and brought
up the grade for the whole distance sunk —nearly
200 ft. —-to a very satisfactory figure. The continua-
tion of this ore has now been driven on at 2100 ft.
for a length of about 30ft., and values have ranged
from 60s. to 80s. per ton. The shoot in which this
ore is contained was first located at 1500 ft., and
prior to the present development the best values were
exposed at 1600 ft. At 2120 ft. the lode is robust and
well-defined, and looks like going down. It also
appears to have widened. Other parts of the mine
where operations are being carried on are reported to
be keeping their end up, while recent developments
in the Chaffers may, in the opinion of the manage-
ment, prove of considerable importance to the co.’s
;Star lease.
• * * *
Edna May (W.A.) is still being plastered
with reports, Fred Tricks (chairman) and E. Dyason
and Co. (mining engineers) being the latest offen-
ders. Tricks estimates that 15,000 tons are proved
above the 73ft. level. On recent yields the ore
averages 24dwt. Conceding that this is all recover-
able, the co. has 18,7250 z. in reserve. Costs and
development will run into 30s. per ton, or (say)
£22,000, so there is about £50,000 profit available
above the 73ft. level. If the co. buys Duff’s claim
next door, £6250 goes to the vendors, leaving about
20s. per share in sight above the aforesaid level.
Dyason’s work was to say whether Duff’s claim was
of value to the Edna. As the south boundary of
Duff’s is only 280 ft. from the ore channel, and as
the ore underlies one in one, Dyason concludes that
Duff’s gets the ore at between 350 and 400 feet,
provided the lode lives down. To ascertain this, he
recommends a bore on the boundary and the rushing
on of an underlie shaft from the 150 ft. level whenever
that may be opened up. If the ore gets to the
boundary, then Duff’s is cheap at the price, and
Edna May is a better claim than Kalgoorlie con-
cludes. If it doesn’t, there will be a scuttle to
place the Edna baby on someone’s doorstep before
long. ’ #
From London; “A mournful crowd
gathered round the death-bed of the Lancefield and
listened to the chairman’s recital of its performances.
He said that as soon as the sulphide zone was reached
—which was just after the co. purchased the pro-
perty—the extraction became unsatisfactory, and new
treatment was rendered necessary. A good deal of
experimental work was done, and finally a dry pro-
cess was installed at a cost of £50,000. This plant
won £900,000 from 600,000 tons, yet in only one
or two months out of the entire period it was in
operation was the co. able to make ends meet, and
the whole of the £900,000, together with £150,000
of working capital, was swallowed up, and a debt
of £40.000 was incurred as well. The co. was leav-
ing a mine with 200,000 tons of ore in sight of an
estimated gross value of from £300,000 to £350,000,
but such were the present working conditions that
they could not make it pay. If fuel was cheaper
and wages low the mine would be a fine spec, but,
alas! both were dear, and nothing remained but to
pass away. A shareholder complained that he and
others had been lured in the past to put up more
money on extravagant promises. The chairman denied
this, and alleged that only the bank and the London
.and ’ Australian Exploration Ltd. had been bled since
■the preference issue in 1908. Moreing said that the
mine might be made to pay with a new plant and
producer-gas power, but even that was problematical;
and as the amount required plus the sum needed to
wipe off existing liabilities would be £120,000, he
could not recommend shareholders to part up. It
will be interesting to see what will happen to the
property now that the co. is dead and gone.” At
this end a suspicion exists that a few knowing ones
will begin where the deceased left off and do
well out of the enterprise.
“Bar None” (W.A.) : An explanation is
wanted from the Bullfinch authorities as to why
shares tumbled from 16s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. just before
the date of the first Is. dividend. Is it because the
public has lost faith in the management, or is it
because the new manager has sent an unfavorable
report to the Board, disagreeing with the estimates
of his predecessor, the late Fred Morgan? If the
latter surmise is correct, shareholders will probably
be told in a few weeks that the value and quantity
of the reserves are lower than previously represented,
and something may also be added about the
unsuitability of the plant for the ore in the deeper
parts of the mine. It is almost certain that a
damaging report of some sort has reached the Board,
as the market report in Adelaide for the week
ended October 8 showed a turnover of 2600 shares,
for October 15, 4500 ; for October 22, 2400; and for
October 29, 19,900. The stock has not been dealt in
to this extent and knocked back 4s. without cause.
The job of making both ends meet was
accomplished by the Star of the West, Kevington
(Vic.), up to the time it closed its books on Sep-
tember 30 ; but it was a near thing. The directors’
fees are down to £l6 a year, and the secretary’s
screw for six months was £4l, so the co. isn’t, wast-
ing money on frillies. The manager has come back
to the upper workings, where there is plenty of for-
mation, but little gold. The western lode will have
to prove a hero to get the co. out of the ditch. If
that lode fails, the co. will have to sink and blaze
out a fresh track at depth.
Llanberris No. 2 and the Normanby North,
Ballarat, have been lumped together for a fresh float.
The two shows shut down about three years ago, and
would have remained in retirement if the New
Normanby to the south and Llanberris No. 1 to the
north had not got on to good quartz. A lot of
stone has come out of the Llanberris No. 2, as it is
right on the line of the indicator formations of the
district. To reach it quickly the New Normanby
shaft will doubtless be pushed ahead. Whatever may
be the luck of the new co., it starts without any
dead weight of royalty such as crippled so many of
the Ballarat mines in the past.

Maori Queen, Bright (Vic.), now shoves
its two dredging plants into better dirt than was
lifted during the financial year just ended. Records
for that time show up thus: —
No. 1 plant. No. 2 plant.
Cub. yds. dredged .. 325,303 316,879
Gold won, oz. .. . . 912 J 1,054^
Weekly j'ield, oz. . . 17.8 20.6
Average of ground, grs... 1.34 1.6
That the co. was able to pay four ss. dividends on
dirt seems tiptop; but, then, the share regis-
ter is very small. Only £63 was left with the
bankers at the end of the half-year, so there isn’t
much to spare should any breakage of plant occur.
As the dredges are in better dirt, a reserve should
now be built up and an amortization fund created to
provide for a refund of capital when the end comes.
That anguish-stricken document, the
liquidator’s balance-sheet of the Chillagoe Co. (in
liquidation), has been followed by a proposal from
the same quarter to reconstruct the Etheridge Gold
Mines, Ltd. The busted Etheridge Co. was a pup
of the Chillagoe, and it froze up as hard as its parent
because the ore wasn’t there to keep the surface
equipment going. This was the trouble with the
Chillagoe. That co.’s experience ought to have
told the Board that it shouldn’t build a railway and
put a plant on any one of the Etheridge mines until
abundance of ore had been proved. The new
"Etheridge co. is to be in 120,000 shares of 10s.,
issued as paid to 6s. Old shareholders are to have
the right to take up share - for share, and to apply
for any unapplied-for scrip on payment of Is. a
share, and another Is. on application. Thus the co.,
if all the shares are taken up, will start with
£12,000 and the prospects which are being got in
the Queenslander mine. According to the new mana-
ger, No. 3 level there shows well over loz. stone.
If the co. had given ex-manager Mac George the cash
to open the Queenslander, it looks from this as
though he wouldn’t now be cursing his luck (and
other things) in Collins-street. As the Chillagoe
held a big parcel of Etheridge shares, liquidator
Hewitt might have stated whether that co. intends
to renew its investment. On that point the success
of the reconstruction may turn.
Bluff Colliery (C.Q.) has
another half-year, bringing its total to 17. The out-
put for the last lap was 7547 tons, which is better
than the previous one by 2020 tons. The co. seems
fairly well pleased with itself, notwithstanding the
small output. The chairman had a couple of items
of interest to say at the meeting. First, the lease
owned by the "Bluff at Blair Athol, from which mar-
vellous results were expected when the two fuels
were mixed, is to be worked on tribute. The Bhiff
Co. will give a helping hand with machinery. The
other remark of note concerns the Mammoth Admi-
ralty Co., in which the Bluff has a half interest. A
first sample of this co.’s coal sent to the naval folk
caused them to wave their hats, but the second
brought back only a groan. The subsidiary co. then
went out for ten seconds. Now the _ Admiralty coal
inspector has agreed to give it a third trial. Inci-
dentally, the gentleman hinted that the Bluff might
send a parcel of its own product, and learn a few
truths about it.
Re the black-fuel business in Central Bananaland,
the other coal shows range themselves thus. The
Blair Athol, near Clermont, pursues the even tenor
of its way and speaks nowadays “of the usual quar-
terly dividend of sixpence.” The output for September
was 7770 tons, which is slightly more than the
Bluff’s effort for the half-year. The Newcastle, near
the Blair Athol, has just opened its shoulders to
actual coal-getting, and scored 1036 tons for Sep-
tember. Others in Bananaland’s Centre are in the
chrysalis stage.
Adelaide spent Cup week in the throes, of
a mild oil boom, when two cos. Were floated ; one
has £5OOO cash (over-subscribed), and the other
hopes to get £lO,OOO in monthly instalments. So
far, Adelaide has known more about olive oil than
the other sort, and probably it thinks the latter is
as easy to get. Anyway, the poor little amounts
asked for suggest that. Government ‘ Geologist Ward
declares there is no oil in S. Aus, Perhaps he is
wrong; but if he is, it is ‘pretty certain the cos.
will have to go down deep to prove him wrong, and
£5OOO won’t do it.
The Surprise Dredging Co. is happily
named, for Charters Towers was astonished when
an enterprising Victorian surveyor declared the
creek below the Brilliant and St. George mill to
be a highly payable dredging area. It is certain
that some gold exists there, because battery tailings
have been washed down Gladstone Creek for years
past, and the creek itself is auriferous; but why
not sluice a few loads to see what it is. actually
worth? • Borehole tests are notoriously deceptive.
* * * *
Tongkah Compound is making the pace
among Siamese dredging concerns. Its average for
eight weeks is 2.291 b. of tin oxide per cub. yard:
125,250 cub. yards gave 128.6 tons of tin oxid.,.
worth over £ 13,000. On the average less than 1000yds-
were thus required to provide a ton of black tin-
Four months ago it was known that there was a.
run of rich values ahead ; but they are quite excep-
tional. The ground has been well bored, and specu-
lators are advised to get the assay plan which the'
co. has issued. They will then be able to tell pretty
well what is immediately in front of the co.’s one'
machine.
Golden Pole’s heart still beats. Royalty
amounting to £B4 was received-during the half-year
ended September, but it took £lO7 more than this-
to run the show. The co. now has a cash balance of
£973 and stores valued at £605, and is owed £505.
The mine is still under tribute and may be kept
alive by this means for some time to come. Just
how much of the book debts is collectable is not
stated, but seeing that the co.' has a few pounds-
shareholders are asking why the Board doesn’t look
out for something else, instead of frittering away
the balance of its resources in fees, rent, telegrams
and stamps. It did fossick for a new show when it
had a few thousands to spare, but after losing most
of the funds in prospecting delusions, it came to the
conclusion that the quest was a hopeless one.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November 10, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
The comparatively small Sydney contin-
gent that went to Flemington is limping
home in more or less regretful mood. The
poor old public, with its unerring instinct to
back the wrong horses, gave the bookies a
golden Cup this year. A few reminiscences
of the glittering week in Melbourne are
dribbling in from the returned Cornstalks.
According to one observant dame, the women
from the Harbor City held their own at the
Denmans’ ball. Says Mrs. Blank Cartridge:
“The decorations were even finer than the
waratah scheme of last year, for gold and
white lights up better than dark red.
Mrs. Evelyn Beerbohm, who used to be Elsie
Anderson, was, to my mind, the loveliest
woman in the room. Mrs. Leonard Dangar,
Mrs. Frank Osborne, and Mrs. Alfred Turn-
bull were also in the lead for good looks. In
spite of a rather floppy style—-the vogue, of
course —Sheila Chisholm was much admired
by Melbourne’s silver-gilt youths at this
dance. Beads were much worn. Lady Den-
man’s handsome sister-in-law, Mrs. Harold
Pearson,, wore a Cleopatra gown of golden
ones. There was some drapery underneath,
of course. Madge Titheradge looked very
well in a film of green and white chiffon. A
male critic remarked that there was nothing
to offend the most fastidious in this dia-
phanous gown; but I really don’t know what
he meant.”
“Governor Day Bosanquet, of South Aus-
tralia,” says a Sydney man who is just home
from the Cup, “was a sprightly grass-widower
at the revels. In spite of his 71 summers
he went forth to all the dances, and negoti-
ated the one- and two-steps in the most skil-
ful manner. His wife and daughters, how-
ever, took life more quietly in the sub-regal
cot at home.”
Max Meldrum, whose pictures were the
strong meat of the R. A. Society’s show here,
is painting the Gee-Gee’s portrait in his
Privy Councillor’s finery. This is his Ex.’s
best party frock, and it only comes out of its
moth balls about once a year. Meldrum will
also put his powerful brush-work into the
gorgeous saxe-blue mantle of the Michael and
George order, the last word in male millinery,
which will drape the sitter’s shoulders. The
P.C. uniform was one of the sartorial events
of the Cup-week ball at Government House.
It was so much purred over by the Sydney
contingent (female persuasion) that a
reliable eye-witness vows he thought they’d
snip bits off the white satin breeches as
souvenirs of the party.
The appointment of Captain Macnaghten
to the staff of Governor Strickland has not
been officially announced in Sydney at date
of writing, though it’s a sure tip. He is a
lawyer by trade and a militiaman by force
of habit. As area-officer for Woolloomooloo
and its neighborhood, Captain Macnaghten
met the anti-compulsory parent in his
fiercest mood. This mood was reflected in
the cadet, who felt quite certain that a bit
of drill would be fatal to his health. Never-
theless, Macnaghten licked the lads into such
shape that his little lot was considered the
best-disciplined squad in the march of the
20,000 cadets through this city a while ago.
The militiaman—who’ll be an extra A.D.C.
in place of the departed Forbes—is a son
of. the Melville Macnaghten who was
knighted in 1907, after long service as Chief
of the Criminal Investigation Office, Scot-
land Yard.
A garden party, dedicated to High Com-
missioner Reid, occurs at Government
House on November 20. The Strickland
lady and selections from the kindergarten
(now ruralising at Moss Yale) will descend
to sea-level for the occasion.
The civic banquet to G. H. Reid is dated
for November 13. The immense feed will
take place in the Town Hall vestibule, which
will be trimmed with green and gold lights
and garlands of smilax draped so carefully
that no loose ends can flutter into the soup.
High Commissioner Reid’s daughter
Thelma, who is no longer engaged to Mr.
Jack Playfair, is not likely to remain disen-
gaged indefinitely. That minx Rumor whis-
pers that a swain elsewhere is trying to
persuade the Reids’ pretty daughter to say
“I will.”
The wealthy N.S.W. brewery family of
Tooths is slowly approaching this city with
the majesty of a Spanish Armada. ' For
weeks its arrival from England has been
heralded by respectful pars in the local press.
The narty consists of Knight Robert Lucas,
his dame, and a son and daughter. It is
expected to air ye here any moment this
week, and a fashionable hostel is airing the
sheets and putting clean towels in its best
rooms. I believe the Tooths (Teeth sounds
better) are so disgustingly rich that they
can. and do, give away thousands of pounds
to deserving charities without asking for the
change.
General Sir lan Hamilton, who comes
here presently to overlook “Tommy Corn-
stalk,” has, or had, some connections in the
Maitland district of this State. Hamilton’s
elder sister, now an old ladv who writes a
hand as clear as type, is the widow of the
late Col. Scobie,. of the Black Watch. Scobie
was born in this State. His father was a
cocky-farmer in the Maitland paddocks.
Mrs. Ethel Phillips Fox has an exhibition
of her pictures in Anthony Horderns’ art
gallery. _ The gallery, in consequence, is
alive with color and movement. Artist
Ethel Fox dashes on her pigments with a
superb contempt for lady-like or drawing-
room art which must take away the breath
of the veteran Du Faur. That formidable
breakwind between modern art and our
National Gallery is suspected of being more
in touch with the early Victorian “sampler”
period when every detail was pain-
fully attended to by the painter. Any-
how, he looked a sorrowful old gentle-
man as he made his exit from one of the
finest one-artist shows this town has seen
for a long time. A notable example of Mrs.
Fox’s broad and dashing treatment of color
and her unerring technique is “High Tide at
St. Malo.” An Algerian painting full of
life, “Arabs Bargaining,” and some vivid
impressions of Spain and Morocco, are
arresting instances of French influence on
this clever English colorist’s canvas. Some
gems of blue and green pigment represent
Sydney Harbor in all its moods. The artist
is now going to paint the surfing girl at
Manly as she sees her, so the Paris Salon
is likely to hang an Australian mermaid or
two on its walls next year.
The sacred rites of serious opera demand
many things of its petted hero, the tenor.
Notably it insists that he shall show his
emotion in his boots. Thus Spencer Thomas,
as Don Jose in “Carmen,” got deeper into
his shoe-leather as the night wore on. By
the time his temper had reached stabbing-
point, and Carmen’s death-struggle was in
sight, Jose was booted almost to his hips.
Ernest Clerc, who seemed to fall over the
famous Helmsman’s Song in “The Flying
Dutchman,” had some excuse for his rocky
phrasing. The bumping of the craft
on a stormy cardboard (or was it can-
vas?) sea made the luckless stage-sailor
deadly sick. That he stuck to his helm and
didn’t drop “Oh, my” into his chanty is
greatly to his credit. A night or two later,
as the Shepherd in “Tristan and Isolde,”
Clerc, who is obviously not a good sailor, was
on hand at Tristan Costa’s last moments,
when the turbulent tenor heaved like a large
brown breaker all over his death-couch.
This spectacle would have turned the
stomach of anyone who wasn’t feeling too
well after meeting “The Flying Dutchman” ;
and, to be on the safe side, Shepherd Clerc
piped his lay without even turning his head
towards the heaving billow of Costa’s vast
chest.
Fiddler Cyril Monk is going to wed the
tuneful Isabel Varney in December. The
engagement has been simmering gently since
the beginning _ of the year. Miss Varney's
last composition, “The Kookaburra’s Cor-
roboree.” an intermezzo two-step published
by Nicholson’s, is a melodious trifle.
A Miss Smith, of Glen Innes, rather thin
in body, but fat in this world’s goods, came
back in the Medina. She is the N.S.W. girl
who is going to marry Purses Delmar Caven-
dish, of the Mooltan. The Medina’s skip-
per, Notley, with the purser, Mr. St. Croix,
bustled off for an eieht or nine days’ jaunt
on the Blue Mountains, soon after tying up
their boat to this shore.
Mrs. Baronet Ward and daughter Eileen
were mentioned in the Medina’s list of pas-
sengers for Sydney; and the M.L. Tourist
office here believed they passed through this
city for the Horse carnival in Melbourne. As
it happened, they dodged the vaccination nui-
sance by changing their plans, and
unpacked their best hats in the Cabbage
Patch.
Dr. Wohlmann, who knows more than
most people about the domestic habits of
geysers, is just back from England. Pie
returns to Maoriland via this port, after a
year’s absence from his thermal menagerie
at Rotorua. Mrs. Wohlmann and two
youngsters shared the learned house-father’s
trip to Europe.
One of the most popular mariners in the
P. and O. line, skipper Gordon, of the
Moldavia, is taking off his sea boots after 40
years’ service. He married a Sydney woman
in the long ago, and is an ardent apostle of
things Australian. Captain Gordon is an
athlete of some power. He was the one-
time terror of aristocratic wasters who pes-
tered attractive lady passengers—this was
in the old days, when he steered the Cale-
donia into Indian ports. He used also to
be. referee at the annual boxing champion-
ship in Poona: it so happened that he was
always wearing _ his shore clothes in that
vicinity at the time. Incidentally he passed
on his tips on defence to his petty officers —
quartermasters in particular.
Comedian W. S. Percy and his wife are
off to foreign parts this month, via America.
The lively Percy’s pet theme for after-supper
narrative, “the smiling wheatfields and
bumpy roads of this sunny land,” will be
stowed away in the hold.
Tourist-officer A. G. Millington takes
the chair formerly occupied in the
Sydney office of the Maoriland Bureau by
the late lamented Montgomery, Mr. Mill-
ington stepped ashore here last week. He
hails from Wellington.
Mrs. Arthur Lassetter is booked for flight
to the other side of the globe.
Cricketer Waddy, in spite of severe
douches of cold water from Ceylon, has
taken 16 passenger tickets for his party.
They leave in the Macedonia for Ceylon,
where a mixed reception is getting ready to
meet them at the landing jetty. “Your
presence deeply resented” is one of the very
slight tokens of esteem that have reached the
promoter over the cables.
The National Council of Women, with
Mrs. MacCallum in charge, completed its
labors for 1913 in the King’s Hall the other
afternoon. Its labors may be very great, but
the nett profit to the nation from its miles
of discussion can only be perceived through
smoked glass—therefore darkly. An official
dame, who is no longer here, used to say that
she never left a meeting of the National
Council of Women without a severe head-
ache and an abject feeling that she had been
saying “The ayes have it” for no other pur-
pose than to prove that all men are sinners,
and most women fools.
The Minister for Education opened a
playground for youngsters in Victoria Park
on Friday afternoon. This idea of play-
grounds for children has been a dream of
the Free Kindergarten Union for years. Mrs.
Francis Anderson, one of the early organisers
of the Free Kindergartens in this city, was,
with Prof. Mackie and one or two other
battlers for the cause, mainly responsible for
the pioneer ground at Miller’s Point. This
plot was given by the Harbor Trust for the
purpose a while ago. Its success has pro-
bably been a lever to help strong-minded citi-
zens drag another in Victoria Park out
of the Government. The municipality has
a voice in the matter; yet, with wonderful
self-restraint, it won’t put a tax of even one
farthing per head per annum on the juvenile
players.
The new sheds for the accommodation of
surfers at Manly were opened with some
pomp and circumstance the other day. A
brass band, local Mayor Bonner, and the
N.S.W. Minister for Works lent their aid to
the ceremony. Suburban Mayors and aider-
men were almost as numerous as sandflies,
but they mercifully refrained from, getting
up in turn to make a speech suited* to the
size of the buildings. These are invoiced at
£lO,OOO. In time the Village by the Ocean
Wave hopes to repay the Government cow,
which is at present showing signs of going
dry.
The domestic problem and its connection
with a rush of desirable treasures to these
shores is coming to some kind of a climax
on November 12. The meeting, which was
originally earmarked for the Town Hall, has
now changed its address to Farmer’s tea
rooms. If it doesn’t alter its intentions
again, it will have occurred in that building
before this reaches you. The Millions Club
is behind this notion of prepaying your
treasure’s passage from England. After
handing over the money here, you can sit
on the Fremantle shore and claim her for
your own before she’s snatched off by des-
perate women in Westralia.
An English governess now in Sydney has
just had an experience of governessing in the
New Hebrides. She rather liked it, and
found no serious fault with the climate. She
says that the mixed English and French
rule is a failure, so far as the natives are
concerned. The primitive savage can grasp
one set of rules and regulations, but he
can’t pigeon-hole two different codes
in his woolly nut. French laws are more
drastic, and the Condominium Court can’t
iron out the legal creases to the satisfaction
of Brown Brother. A suggestion that Brit-
ain may voluntarily give up her piebald share
in the islands has recently trickled through
the press. If so, it’s because it’s as easy to
make water run uphill as to govern those
isles under the dual control of two countries
with totally different views of the right of
black labor to occasionally call its soul its
own.
Horticultural women might put on their
long-distance specs and take a glapee at
Yanco. Irrigation plots of 10, 20 and 50
acres will be let out on certain conditions to
absentees. The man or woman who is work-
ing in the city can contribute so much a
year for five years—anything from £5O for a
small plot. This money is spent in improve-
ments. At the end of that time, the Govern-
ment, acting on behalf of the absentee and
spending his or her money, should have a
young orchard in bearing, and most of the
heavy pioneer work completed. One of
Sydney’s leading barristers and several busi-
ness men are having irrigation patches pre-
pared—at their own expense, of course—for
future homesteads and orchards. How to
get your young onions and green peas to
market, per can, is also arranged for you by
a paternal Government. Small canning plants
will be erected in each vegetable patch or
fruit area. The Yanco peach, which is said
to beat the Californian, will be picked and
preserved on the snot, and, it is hoped, sold
in Australia at 7d. for a 21b. tin. Its rival, the
Californian, costs lOd. or thereabouts—and
you don t necessarily get half a pound of tea
or a couoon with it either. Peas, beans and
tomatoes may now be said to have a future
Hitherto they have often rotted on the
ground because the cost of transport and
Pago distribution has been prohibitive.
All sorts of things, including the Panann
mosquito, threaten to befall this continent
when the canal is opened. The Royal Steam
1 acket Co. (British) proposes to use the
great ditch for a line of steamers between
Southampton and Australian ports—Sydney
for certain. J
F. C. Allen, who has recently been made
a general manager of the P. and O. i u
London (Mr. Shields is the other G.M.)
may come out to this sunny shore next year'
Mr. Allen is the man who used to be so
popular at the company’s Bombay office. ll e
gets the credit of being the person chiefly
responsible for the settlement of the recent
strike amongst P. and O. officers.
Baritone Stanley Leadley, a pupil 0 f
Andrew Black, was bold enough to take the
Town Hall for his concert the other night.
The Concordia Hall would have suited the
size of the audience much better. Our
municipal barn is a dreary, draughty, echo-
haunted cave to warble in, unless it is well-
peopled. Mr. Leadley has a resounding
baritone of good quality ; also he has stacks
of inexperience as a concert singer. This
inexperience got him down both in the Pro-
logue (“Pagliacci”) and in the High
Priest’s remarks to Delilah. Miss Vera
Watt, a handsome young woman with a
robust contralto voice and an indifferent
memory, was Delilah. Though High Priest
Leadley politely gave her the bigger half of
the score to look over, she lost her place
and forgot her music in the latter end of
the second helping from St. Saens’ opera"
The lady had a bad time altogether. The
programme accused her of “Che fargo senza
Euridice.” Pianist Frank Hutchens.
A.R.A.M. (the precocious Maorilander
who is only just old enough to think
about a vote), was responsible for
snacks from Chopin, Liszt, and lesser
lights. Bryce Carter, on the ’cello,
was a delightful streak of musical fat
im rather a lean entertainment. The
Y.M.C.A. Glee Club was so inarticulate in
its first effort, “Hark, the Trumpet,” that
it might have sung “Hark, the Bluebottle!”
and no one would have known the differ-
ence.
St. Clement’s Church, Mosman, is urgently
in need of cash for a new parish hall. To
help the cause, Mr. Livingston Hopkins
(better known as “Flop” on both sides of
the Equator) lent his generous acreage of
trees and garden shrubs for a f§te and cafe
chantant. Something like £54-odd was
taken before the last Chinese lantern made
its good-night bob to the moon.
Kathleen Darby, the Titian-haired girl
from Maoriland, gave an elocutionary re-
cital in Mosman Town Hall the other even-
ing. Mayor Pigott introduced the lady, who
rattled through an attractive programme to
the satisfaction of the audience. Herbert
Ratcliffe lifted up his baritone voice; and
Miss Dorothy Hopkins, at the fiddle, and
Miss Clarice England, on the piano stool,
also took part in the performance.
Bathurst has caught the centenary feeling.
On November 19 it breaks out in a lunch,
levee, banquet and ball. At the ball the
oldest female inhabitants may perhaps dance
with sub-royalty. At any rate. Governor
Strickland rushes up to the City of the
Plains on November 18, gallops through the
lunch, levee, banquet and pioneer hop on
the 19th, and gets back to town on the fol-
lowing morning.
The Bertie Willsallens have rented the
Walter Germans’ roomy abode at Woollahra
Point from December till somewhere in the
early gusts of autumn.
The North Sydney Hospital’s second
descent on the public for eggs resulted in
the collection of a poor 11 dozen—worth, at
present prices, a bare half-sovereign!
N.S.W. Full Court was last week called
upon to decide an interesting point as
between man and wife. The couple were
residing in a house the property of the wife,
when they quarrelled. She left hubby, in
the matrimonial sense, and he stuck on at
the old address. When called upon to leave
he refused, but invited the wife to return to
their home, which she wouldn’t do. She
thereupon moved for an order to eject him.
The husband took the point that, as a hus-
band,_ he had legal right to enter on the
premises, and, therefore, it -was outside the
power of any Court to eject him—in other
words, to condone the matrimonial offence
committed by his wife in refusing to live
with him. On behalf of the lady, it was
argued that the husband was attempting to
force his wife into conjugal relationship by
seizing her property ; and counsel, relying on
Section 16 of the Married Women’s Property
Act, argued that, by its provisions, a married
woman was given protection in respect of her
nropertv from her husband, among others.
The Court unanimously upheld this
view, and fired the husband out of the
bouse, after going through him for the
Costs.
Yours affectionately.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, November IU, 1913.
-My Dear Yarrie,-
A lot of women could have got all their
Cup amusement at a cheaper rate by simply
•throwing one bucket of water over the Cup
.hat, and another over the Cup clothes. Some
•simple rite of the kind, performed in the
‘kindly privacy of the backyard, would have
•done away with all the crowding, hustling
•and waiting that go to make up the average
woman’s day at Flemington. I have seen
‘nothing more pathetic than the huddled mass
of 1913 Cup dressers that tilled the back of
•the (grandstand, while the distant string of
•horaes, with the bright specks atop, streaked
‘through the everlasting rain. The horrible
•‘siftiell of wet macintoshes tilled the air, and
£he skin coats celebrated the good old days
when they contained their rightful owners by
.giving off characteristic odors. Wet feathers
•drooped •over rage-distorted faces, for the
wretched favorites forgot to hurry, and the
•air-cashless of which the feminine half-crowns
were hike humble foundations went down to
train. The arrival of the Government House
..people at mid-day was the star turn for the
■grandstand fashion-prisoners. The Den-
man leading lady was carefully extracted
‘from a fur coat to show off her brown velvet
•dress. After that the gazers had just time
•to note that Miss Ivnatchbull-Hugessen
•looked smart in blue, and that Mrs. Pearson
was retaining her furs, when down came the
rain attain, and the general scamper to cover
•obsenred the official show.
<Mks Day was disappointing from a pro-
imetiader’s point of view—and what other
Ut«jint of view matters? Cold winds and
sleeting rain brought out the fur coats
again, and, though there was a fine interval
during the afternoon, you had to twist your
neck in the stand to see what was being
worn under the skins. The Denman lady
was easily the best-dressed woman on the
course. The vice-regal gang arrived unosten-
tatiously like a troupe of burglars. They came
in the drawing-room motor —the one that
is all enamel and glass. Just as this chariot
was approaching, and while the V.R.C. offi-
cials were grouped carefully on the terrace
steps, a softgoods emperor swerved into
the vacant berth. The vice-regal engine-
driver had to slow down his illustrious
machine, and roll home a bad second, while
the chiffon potentate and his wife bustled
cheerfully across the lawn. Then the star
performers dropped in casually at the terrace
•■steps, and the women revealed their gar-
ments. Her Ex. was in a black satin suit,
with her glossy and well-groomed hair packed
'under a smart black hat. She skipped up
the stairs with her race glasses slung over
■her shoulder. His Ex. and the grey-clad
Helps had to hustle to keep up with her.
The party headed straight for the saddling-
paddock, and seemed glad to have escaped
the powdered menials for once.
The Rupert Clarke lady looked like a
fashion-plate in a check suit of fawn and
white, fawn spats, patent shoes and a dainty
hat perched on her red hair. Belle White,
in charge of auntie Miller, was a nice poster-
girl. She wore a loose Dutch-blue cloak
hanging away from a deeper blue dress
swathed with a toreador sash of red. Her
own red hair provided the last vivid dab of
color. Mrs. Spencer Brunton, in black and
white, wore two red lines down the back.
Mrs. Peter, of Glenloth station, was in tan.
Father Robinson tramped the lawn blithely
like a good sport, with race glasses girded
on. Judge Molesworth for once came out
without his top hat. I believe this is a
record.
Flemington got its sunshine at last on
Steeplechase Day, and a joyful, brightly-
frocked crowd simply pranced up and down
the lawn. The Denman dame wore a giddy
little dress of cream silk muslin over butter-
colored silk, with a bow of lace aft at the
waist. Nothing could have been more arca-
dian and summery. Neat, gold-buckled
shoes, and a bit of black tulle for a hat
finished off the costume. Mrs. Pearson spread
beautiful blue chiffon plumage. The Bart-
telot dame added to the gaiety of the
course with a black silk gown ; it had side
panniers of brilliant green and gold. Miss
Alicia Knatchbull-etc. was all Dutch blue
and wheat ears. The party haunted the
birdcage and saddling paddock most of the
time. His Ex.’s horse Topmast finished
second in the Steeplechase, principally be-
cause everything else except it and the win-
ner had fallen. The joy of the official crate
■over this mild triumph was touching to be-
hold.
The Rupert Clarke lady caused the usual
and expected sensation by appearing in the
bright sunshine in a white chiffon rig that
veiled her figure. Shoes, stockings, hat.
gloves and parasol were all white and
diaphanous. Mrs. George Reid fluttered
about in white crepe de Chine, with a little
floral coatee on her slim figure. She had
made everybody blink on Oaks Day, when
her straw-colored hair and fluffy white neck
were adorned with purple ribbon. Mrs.
Proutt Webb showed the smallest feet on
the lawn in high-heeled buckled shoes. Nor-
dica blazed in diamonds and ospreys and a
black-and-white satin gown. There was not
a dull dress anywhere. Mrs. Sternberg put
on Venetian red of a tricky cut, and her
sister, wife of Dan Lazarus, of the Bendigo
Jockey Club, walked with her in raddle
blue. Thev looked like two wonderful door-
steps. Mrs. Hogan, in banana tints,
brought her mother, Mrs. Walshe, a sporting
dame of 76 summers, who saw the
long day out and announced that she had
no use for a stupid flat race —steeplechases
were her idea of sport.
The Cup Ball at Government House on
Wednesday night was the most magnificent
thing in its way that has burst over Mel-
bourne for years. (Strictly speaking, it
only burst over the deserving rich —-the
people to whom food is a hobby and free
entertainment a necessity.) The garden was
illuminated with strings of lights, so
arranged that theyseemed to be holding up
the dark tent of Night and keeping Social-
ism at bay. The guests in the slow-moving
string of motors that crawled serpent-wise to
the door were almost hypnotised before they
reached the portico, where fat and gorgeous
footmen showed them exactly where to tread
on the red carpet. Maids unwrapped them
in dressing-rooms trimmed with gold-topped
toilet machinery, and more stout footmen
shepherded them into the blinding brilliance
of the ballroom, which was all gold—like a
pawnbroker’s dream.
G.-G. Denman looked awfully fetching and
self-conscious in his Privy Councillor’s party
costume. In case you don’t know, it con-
sists of white silk knickerbockers, white silk
stockings and diamond-buckled shoes, a coat
fitting skin-tight and thickly plastered with
winking decorations and orders. There were
other accessories too numerous to note at one
sitting. The medals made him look as if he
had won a whole brass-band competition, and
got the best batting and bowling averages in
four suburban cricket clubs. Her Ex., in
blush-pink brocade, a diamond tiara, and
diamond and ruby necklace, was right
enough; but she couldn’t hold a candle to her
husband, who shone out in a room that was
just lit up with diamonds and tickled to
death with ostrich feathers. The Barttelot
dame put a diamond circlet round her head
and wore soft white draperies. All in vain.
His Ex., with all his grocery-orders on,
swept by like a liner on a dark night.
Everybody who has broken into “Society”
was present. Nobodies, who haven’t accumu-
lated enough to buy the necessary golden
jemmy and skeleton keys, wrung their futile
bank-books in far suburbs, and felt mad
enough to go in for Socialism. The struggle
for tickets amongst those who are on the
vice-regal horizon was dreadful. The For-
rest dame (we’re right in the fold now!)
bewailed the absence of Bigjohn, who was
standing by Joseph Cook in the House. Big-
john might have attended in his own Privy
Councillor’s fancy dress, which, by the way,
seemed to contain its owner with great
difficulty at the last' big function. Most
of the nice naval men from the cruiser Mel-
bourne came and danced. Rear-Admiral
Patey was on hand, wrinkling up that big
nose of his in continuous smiles. He cer-
tainly does enjoy himself. Mrs. Manisty
attended in white and silver, with her hus-
band, but insisted on leaving early in order
to run home and interview Baby. Mrs.
Pearce wore green, and Mrs. Andrew Fisher
was in black—perhaps as mourning for
Andrew’s deceased Government.
The Government House party occasionally
rested for a few minutes on the dais under
the blue-and-gold canopy; but they spent
most of the evening dancing briskly. Golden
baskets, heaped with heavily-scented white
flowers, hung by golden chains all round
the room, which was dadoed with pale gold
silk crbpe, stencilled with burnished gold
and bordered with deep gold fringe. The
long windows were open on to the terrace,
which was dim with soft lights and musical
with the splash and ripple of a fountain.
The corridor inside the windows' was lined
with red felt and fitted with palm-sheltered
corners. The big entrance hall, near the
drawing-rooms, had a new cover—soft
mignonette green. It made a fine back-
ground for the gowns. Another favorite
preening snot was in front of the famous
blue-and-white tapestries in the drawing-
rooms. A refreshment buffet was unlocked
from the first dance for the chronically
thirsty ; but the supper really happened at
midnight.
A herd of those interesting people who live
for their -stomachs alone got wind of the
gieat spread, and banked up outside the
closed doors, where they pushed and shoved
like the early-door crowd at a theatre, or
domain dwellers at a soup depbt. Their
anxiety was quite shameless. Footmen with
a sense, of humor occasionally moved the
doors slightly, just to enjoy the agitation of
the massed animals, and then secured the
barrier again with a heartless slam. Eventu-
ally the house party went in by another door,
in order to avoid getting trampled to death,
and seated themselves securely before the
mob was admitted. They looked on coldly
at the stumbling rush. All the little electric
bulbs were tied tightly in pink silk, and
g « v< A off ? gentle blush-light which showed
e plate. Gold candelabra and big
gold tankards were heaped among the orange
trees growing in gold tubs. The food was
all the ravenous scramblers could have de-
sired, and the many who danced blissfully
until the supper gong droned didn’t go
hungry because of the first-comers’ savage
appetites and manners.
The Federal Government House people,
having noted the drunk and disorderly state
of the weather, decided to be original and
hold the customary garden-party indoors. As
usual, the invitations included the great
shadowy mass of people who have to be in-
vited to something or other. If there was a
vice-regal dog-fight on the social programme
they would be asked to that; but, lacking
the dog-fight, the garden-party serves the
purpose. The ton or so of invitations made
the function a horribly difficult one to man-
age. At 3.30, the great invited were wedged
tightlv and progressing at a church shuffle
from the terrace to the doorway, where her
Ex. was doing the handshaking. Once
through the doors, the breathless guests
found food of the tea and strawberry grade
snrpad invitingly on small tables in the ball-
room, while the dining-room had buffets and
more tables. There was enough for the most
voracious. The show was such a success
that the band had to blow the lingerers
away with a charge of Gorsave. The last
glimpse the last guest caught was of a party
of joyous youngsters falling upon the rem-
nants of the feast, under the careful direc-
tion of nurses and attentive footmen.
Audrey Chirnside, who accompanied her
nretty mother, was easily first in the dress
competition. I forget exactly what she wore,
but it was beautiful. Mrs. George Chirn-
side was enveloped in a gown that was all
black and white beads. Mrs. Wallach, in a
sapphire blue frock to match her eyes,
brought Mr. and Mrs. Merton, a couple of
German visitors who have done the Cup-
time social rounds. The John Madden dame
spread handsome crgpe draperies, and
daughter Lesly looked plump in black. Mrs.
Stewart Brunton was in navy and cerise,
and Mrs. Gordon Inglis, from the country,
showed that the smart backblocks matron
knows how to dress when there is a lawn to
decorate. Several stout dames were suffering
agonies from sore feet —the natural result of
a week’s hard going in new patent leathers.
All stout ladies should be given social exemp-
tion certificates for Cup week; to borrow a
sporting phrase, they are not up to their
own weights.
The first polo outbreak was the coldest
entertainment imaginable. Most of the
women-spectators sat in their cars, and shiv-
ered miserably inside their wraps, while the
players themselves put on extra things over
their togs.. Help Burnham was a humorous
spectacle in a sweater with the sleeves cut
away to show his guernsey colors. The gar-
ment also revealed a long and partly sun-
burnt neck and an elaborately tattooed arm.
On top of all this he had tied his helmet
with a chin ribbon. The G.-G. did not play.
Help Pollok Wore a brown loUhge suit and
took walking exercise with a very pretty
girl. Mrs. Henty looked out from a huge
collar of civet cat —a gaudy animal with
tiger stripes. George Chirnside galloped and
smote in the thick of the fray* and daughter
Audrey kept herself warm by applauding.
Mrs. Landale had a tea party on at her
own home; but the other polo dames at-
tended to her hostess duties. Mrs. Everard
Browne (a Chirnside and a polo enthusiast)
poured warm tea for the players. Blue noses
were worn by everybodv, and the gnashing
of teeth reminded me of another place where
the Best People won’t gather, if they can
have a good time without getting there!
It appears that the lady Who was buried
under feathers on Derby Day was not Mrs.
Secretary Guise; that charming young per-
son was then away in the country with her
sick husband. . The unknown lady is hereby
fined five shillings for resembling Mrs.
Guise. But I am bound in self-defence to
add that one woman buried under feathers
looks like any other woman under feathers.
People who are entitled to mention in social
columns should be plainly numbered.
Mrs. Thomas Baker, of the Baker and
Rouse photographic firm, gave a great and
Monous party on Cup Day. And the
McMickings, Riverina squattocrats, heroi-
cally made themselves responsible for a
strawberry tea. just when strawberries were
deliriously expensive.
Captain Waters and his fair-haired wife
invaded the race frivolities. It is unneces-
sary to add that Mrs. Waters’s frocks were
lovely. In early November no woman comes
to Melbourne without such things.
Lady Denman had a birthday last week,
and hubby’s gift was a painting of the
kiddies, Thomas and Judith, by Australian
artist Power. The youngsters are shown
mounted on Shetland ponies, and the lady
(who wasn’t in the conspiracy) has let the
artist know that she considers it bosker, or
words to that effect.
Rear-Admiral Patey has a wife and two
children in England, and the trio will
shortly join him here.
Captain Nutting was quietly married on
arrival m England. The bride is said to be
a nice Irish girl. She is not a beauty, but
has a line figure and is sweetly musical.
Tvr ®. a^es ’ Duckenfield station, on the
N.S.W . side, pervaded Melbourne during race
time with a library of lovely frocks and a
full team of sisters and nieces. The girls
brought their own motors, which they drove
themselves.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
More revelry. On Saturday there was a fete at
Government House in aid of the Lady Victoria
Buxton Girls’ Club. Tea flowed like water, with the
result that tannin-frenzied citizens bought everything
within sight, and swelled the proceeds of the
entertainment to vast proportions. Lady Bosanquet
acted as starter in this charitable orgy, and with her
at the Gate were a distracting regiment of muslined
youth and beauty carrying yellow-bedecked crooks.
(Ihe crooks were intended to be symbolical, I fancy.
Crooks and burglaries have been associated since the
first Aim beginning of things ; and what is a Govern-
ment House fete but one large, altruistic robbery?)
In the ballroom, concerts, variety shows and light
drama raged, with Mrs. Delmar Hall, Mrs. Kvffin
Thomas, Miss Hack, Miss Deeley, Mr. Eugene Alder-
man, Mr. Talbot Smith, and Mr., Frank Williams
as the star performers, and Mrs. Arthur Rymill, Mrs.
George Box and Miss Coles as stage and business
managers. On the lawn were a children’s team parade
and a display of floral parasols. A small Angas
rarsons boy and his partner were attractive hya-
cinths, and the John Downer baby and the Arthur
Cudmores’ daughter won a prize as bluebells. Further
prizes were won by the parasols of Mr Astlev’
daughter, and a Hawker aaiden. Really,'my dear
I draw myself aside at times and wonder if we aro
in Adelaide or in Ragan Rome. If it were not for
our trams, churches and the glimpse of a passing
bishop now and then, I should say the latter soph
is the wild Bacchantic force of our gaiety. *
An annoying variety of whooping cough is devas
tating this city. It attacks, not the young but the
elderly. Few things are more tragically comic than
the spectacle of a stout pater-familias whooping ahnnt
the streets like a child of five.
The S. H. Ayers are back from a wedding trin
through most of Europe and America. Other returned
voyagers are Mrs. Matheson and her daughters
The Bishop Thomases are on their way. They wili
be officially welcomed at the Exhibition on December
1. Meanwhile the F. J. Fishers and the 11. Swifts
have booked London-bound passages for the earlv
New Year. y
Miss Ivy Phillips gave a farewell recital at the
Victoria Hall last week. She is off to Melbourne
Miss Sylvia Whitington, Mr. Brewster-Jones and
Mr. Robyns lent a hand with the programme.
The Charlie Horns’ house, on the Waverley Ridge
Mount Lofty, which has been for sale for some time’
has been bought by a Yorke’s Peninsula farmer. What
plutocrats these bucolics are, to be sure. The modern
West Coast and Yorke’s Peninsula farmer who lacks
a motor-car or two is as rare as truth in Japan
Artist Follen Bishop and his wife, normally of
England, are good enough to be charmed with S A
where they’ve been since February last. In fact they
are beginning to talk of getting their two-years’
tickets extended. Till now they’ve been busy about
Belair and the lower slopes of the hills, and thev
want to get further afield into the real “back
country.”
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

“Wallaby”: I have kissed the Book. The
prisoner at the bar is the ferocious shark of the
Northern waters. A patrol was recently out in the
King and Liverpool Rivers district (N.T.), searching
for nine niggers who had murdered Jim Campbell.
The party had occasion to cross a stream at night in
an old dug-out. Most of them had got over safely,
leaving the bobby-in-charge to follow. Two-feller
binghi were doing the paddling, and the Law sat at
the stern. To balance the craft, it leaned well back.
Half-way across, one Binghi uttered a mighty yell
and dropped his paddle. The Law sat bolt upright,
and the movement probably saved its life, as a shark,
estimated to be about 25ft. long, had come up quietly
under the stern and was evidently about to jump
and have Law for its supper. The man has been
through some scarey adventures, but he admitted
that it was the closest call he has had yet. A
revolver kept the hungry brute away until the scared
nigs with the one remaining paddle reached the
other side safely.
THE DEMANDS OF SOCIETY.
HAROLD: “ Strike me, you're a restless bloke,
Bert. Wodfer want ter borrer me boots
fer?"
BERT: “Well, I'm takin' a lady to er darnce
ter-night, and I finds it orkward on the
feet, not ’ avin ’ nothin' on 'em."
“N. or M.”: About that platypus which
“Leo Lear” has nominated for one of the issues of
the national stamp (B. 16/10/’l3). Why not adopt
Tassy’s old platypus duty stamp as it stands —-
same as it is proposed to do with Westralia’s swan?
The design is simple and good ; it was the work of
Mrs. Charles Meredith, an artist best known by her
two fine volumes of Tasmania’s native flora. She
has also, among other things, some fine studies of
indigenous fish swimming in water-colors round one-
of the rooms in the Hobart Museum ; but these are
less known than they deserve to be. To get back to
the platypus. Has science yet discovered whether the
creature is a mammal, and, if so, how so? It is
lactiferous, but apparently Nature changed her mind
when half through the job. According to one Tas-
manian observer, the lady platypus disgorges a
milky fluid for the sustenance of the family. Has
any Abo.-naturalist information to offer?
“Scrub”: Re dog-ticks and the best way
to save the hound that is attacked. This recipe I
have never known to fail from the Tweed to Cairns.
Give one-half teaspoon of baking soda in half a pint
of milk. Repeat next day with half the quantity of
soda. I do not take any trouble to draw out the
ticks, as the soda kills them ; but if the tick is
drawn out it is best done in the way “C. Lloyd”
describes (B. 9/10/’l3). The tick seems to me tc
cause fever only when not drawn out; if drawn
out it also causes blood-poisoning when the wound
is not properly treated. “Sports” going for a day
or two where ticks are bad will find this a good
thing to keep flhem from fastening on the dogs: one
teaspoon of flowers of sulphur, mixed with a soft
mush and given to the tyke in the morning before
the expedition.

“Flinderino” : Binghi likes his walk-about,
but otherwise takes no pleasure in holidays. I be-
longed to “The Rookery,” a bachelor establishment
on the beach road at Cairns, and Palm Island
Douglas was our general rouseabout. We gave Doug-
las a holiday one Sunday, and invited him to join us
in a fishing excursion across Trinity Bay. Our
flatty had no sails and only one pair of oars, so we
allowed Douglas to take first turn at pulling. It
was a glorious day for a row, although a trifle hot,
and the tide was against us, but nevertheless we
enjoyed ourselves immensely. Douglas was let row
all the way, as it was rather dangerous to change
seats at sea, our craft being small and overloaded.
We got to Brown’s Bay in two hours, and discovered
we had not sufficient bait, so we put Douglas ashore
and told him he could go to Ah Ling’s humpy, which
was about two miles further along the beach, and
get some prawns. On returning with the saltwater
grasshoppers Douglas was told off to gather some
wood and get a fire going for the billy. After that
he had nothing to do until dinner-time, when he was
sent about a mile up the creek to the waterhole to
refill the demijohn with fresh water. We had a
smaller jar, but it contained medicine, and as none
of us was feeling well we thought we’d better not
sacrifice it. After dinner our botanist went ashore
and took Douglas with him, and at 6 p.m. they re-
turned with some beautiful staghorn ferns which the
blackfellow had climbed for; also he had managed
to secure half a hundredweight of tassel ferns. AVe
then commenced the return journey, and Douglas
had the bad luck to strike the last of the ebb tide,
against which he battled until 9 p.m., when our flatty
grounded on the beach outside “The Rookery.” The
following Sunday we proposed a similar excursion,
and told Douglas he could have the day off and come
with us. “No, thank it, please, boss,” he said;
“mine tink it me stay home and work.”

“Kobbi”: Though they don’t mind buying
their bread from the Chow baker and their stores
from Ram Bux, the Hindoo hawker, the Laborites
of Queensland’s back country are liable to take their
unionism very seriously. The other night, at a
Cloncurry township, there
was a strike at a dance.
A “scab” union is being
fomented in those parts,
and when the organiser of
it was discovered on the
boards, the master of cere-
monies refused to order
the crowd to grab its mut-
ton for the next darnce
until the fiend was off the
premises. The crowd
agreed with him, and on
the solicitation of the
local “lathe r,” the
“bogus” bloque left. Then
everything went merry as
a dinner-bell-—until the
M.C. (a new one —the first
one had apparently gone
off to his mine on night
shift) discovered a further
calamity. There were two
“scabs" on the floor! The
merriment dropped dead
immediately; and the man
at the piano refused to
touch another string till
the offenders went. Then
music voluptuous swelled
forth again, and all went
merry till it was time to think of going home to
cut the “crib” for the day-shift.

Rules posted in the Coonamble district
(N.S.W.) for the guidance of cocky-shearers:—
, G) All cockies, before coming on to the board,
shall have their whiskers trimmed.
(2) No cocky shall bring seed wheat on the
board.
(3) In the event of a shearer or a shed hand ask-
ing a cocky for tobacco or matches the cocky shall
instantly produce same.
(4) The cocky shall not shout for all hands and
the cook oftener than five times a day.
(5) The cockies must not complain about the
cut, as cockies are not judges of a cut.
(6) Cockies shall not talk about the land tax,
scarcity of labor, immigration, or the country being-
ruined. ”
(7) All cockies shall wear hay-band bowyangs so
as to enable the shearers to distinguish them from
the boss.
(8) The cocky shall not call himself “the back-
bone of the country.”
Now the cocky might produce a few rules for the
guidance of the other fellow. He might, for in-
stance, require the other fellow, usually himself the
staunchest Laborite in the country, to explain at
least once a day why he punches the cocky in the
eye for casting aspersions on a Parliamentary Labor
party that has turned tail on practically every
plank of the Labor platform.
THE PATIENT SUFFERER.
STOUT PARTY : “ You don't mean to say you put your money on poor old Gooseflesh !”
LEAN DITTO : “Jones told me it would take an awful lot of beating, and he was right.
It took the awful lest beating I ever saw."
“Jan”: Don’t know where “Gouger” (B.
16/10/’l3) got his information from anent porcu-
pines, but it wasn’t from &'-fto,rcupine. His “slow-
footed crawler” can put up 10orl2 miles an hour to
start with. Secondly, on hearing fodtsteps, the animal
does not turn into an animated pincushion, but in-
sinuates himself into a combination of a post-hole
digger and a steam shovel. He can go down six
inches or so in hard soil in 20sec., and keep on sirik--
ing. Even if you catch him up, you haven’t yet got
nim, by a long chalk. If you try to lever him-JOttE
with the point of a pick, you run a good chance of,
breaking the handle before you shift him. If h£T
were harnessed he would make a good holdfast
forest devil. Thirdly, if you feel inclined ..to do him;
a good turn, Iky him on his back, and leave him,-'
when, according to “Gouger,” he is as helpless as a
turtle in the same posture. Fourthly, “Gouger-” can •
have my share of porcupine flesh. It may 'be ail lfe
says about it, but I can’t forget that its owner -
fattens on “stink” ants for choice. Maybe, I’m
judiced, but I loathe tucker grown on stink ants.

“Lagani Namo” : Hans Andersen may have
got some of his fairy stories from Papua. Here’s
one. Ages ago, in the land of the Motuans, two
youths lost themselves while out with a hunting
party. For several days they subsisted solely on
water. They became very weak, and at noon one
day collapsed on an arid ridge (there are no arid
ridges in Papua, as a matter of fact). Both dreamt
that they were in a grove of strange palms, and
they were shown how to strip the frond-sheaths from
these, and get the pink pith for food. When the
boys awoke they were amazed to see that, instead of
being on the arid ridge, they were in a scene the
exact replica of their dream. Each began to de-
scribe the dream he’d had, and this further surprised
them. Urged by hunger, they set about getting some
of the pith; but just as they were about to eat of
it, people from their village found them and gave
them other food. However, one of the boys took a
bundle of the pith home. There he described his
dream to his fellow villagers, who pooh-poohed it,
saying that the vadia was poisonous. Unsatisfied,
the boy went to his grandmother, who was dying,
and after explaining to her that she couldn’t pos-
sibly. live much longer, persuaded her to eat the
vadia-to ascertain if it was poisonous. Grandma
consented, but "insisted that she should be left by
herself in the tiut'for three full days after partaking
of the vegetable.. When the time was,, up, all the
villagers assembled, expecting to find her corpse, and
three of the handsomest maidens were sent to inves-
tigate. Pulling the mats down from the doorway
they peepefl inside, and, behold, instead of a dead,
shrivelled corpse, there was the most h. autifuL young
woman they’d ever seen. Thus had Providence re-
warded her for her self-sacrifice. Of course, the yarn
may not be true, but there is an easy way to test it.
I have plenty of vadia palm here, but I’m short of a
grandmother. Has anybody a grandmother to spare?
“Tom Noddy”: “Gordon G.” (B.
23/10/’l3), gibing at geographers’ blunders about
Australia, quotes from an 1880 edition of Meikle-
john’s book. Meiklejohn has, however, since found
.out, Jfiat Australia has more than one river. He
now mentions eight. He also gives some important
natural-history information. In discussing Australian
flora he mentions the flame trees, “whose vivid red
flowers can be seen for 60 miles.” He’s got better eye-
_sight than I have. Yet in some matters he is still out
of date. For instance: “The rabbit in Australia,
having eaten all the grass in some districts, is now
to climb trees.” Mikejack apparently
know that, having finished off the trees,
jHtnny is nowadays attacking green immigrants.

“F.H.R.”: Apropos cyanide sands, what is
“Quidam” coming at? Does he think I’m wasting
ink over the chance of the kids getting poisoned?
Not me! But the Cows is the; iliing. I’ll bet
“Quidam” a quid that if he saw my old Cherry
quivering in agony before she threw the seven, all
because.-of licking the blasted cyanide tailings heap,
he’d ha’ cried the same as me. Ten quids’ worth of
as good a milker as ever had a teat pulled, and her
rolling fat, and fre couldn’t eat her! Yet we ain’t
all so particular, with meat 4d. a pound. However,
“Quidam” doesn’t say that cyanide tailings won t
poison goats and cattle. They will; but tailings
won’t before they are cyanided. So I guess it’s a
fair thing to blame the cyanide.

PRINCE CHARMING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I am tired, so tired of it all,” I said,
“Of scrubbing and sewing and baking bread.
Year in, year out, there is naught to change,
And the young, wild heart of me longs to range.”
But they said: “Keep watch o’er the rolling down,
For Prince Charming will ride some day to town.”
“I am tired,” I said, “of the country ways,
And the endless ribbon of silent days;
I would have the great world’s worst and best;
I would love to follow youth’s golden quest.”
And they said: “You shall see beyond the skies
AVhen Prince Charming kisses your dreaming eyes.”
“I am tired,” I said, “of the mignonette ;
He shall bring red roses to make me forget
The scents of the old-world garden gay,
This lordly lover who comes some day.”
And the young maids laughed: “But your flower is
rue.
There is no Prince Charming will come for you.
“There are roses,” they said, “for youth’s noonday,
But your youth has burned to its ashes grey.
You have lived too long in the old bush town,
AVith the dull winds moaning across the down,
And a corpse you will be, all stiff and white,
Ere the tapers burn for your wedding night.”

BEALE PIANOS.
The fadl that to-day we are the largest piano firm doing business in the Commonwealth is due solely to the
quality of our instruments.
No effort has been spared in the manufacture of Beale Pianos to reach perfection of tone and ensure
durability. To-day our instruments stand absolutely unrivalled in those respects.
Beale Pianos are specially designed and made to meet all the exigencies of the Australian climate. They,
embody every improvement known in piano construction, and are made under the direct supervision of an expert who
has made scientific piano manufacture a life study. In addition, they possess special features which you cannot get in
other pianos ; such as our permanent steel tuning-system, hexagonal bass-strings, patent cast-in hitch-pins, and our
patent method of building up the casework.
The Beale Permanent Steel Tuning System renders what was hitherto the weakest part of a piano the strongest.
In every Beale Piano the wrest-plank is made of solid iron. The wrest-plank is that part of the piano into which are
driven the tuning pins to which are attached the wires (or “strings”). In every imported piano the wrest-plank is
made of wood, which has to bear the strain (about 20 tons) of all the wires when the piano is in tune. So that in every
piano that has a wooden wrest-plank there is a probability of the wrest-plank splitting and the piano becoming untunable
in consequence. And in every piano but the Beale the wrest-plank is made of wood.
In all Beale Pianos the wrest-plank is solid iron, a part of the iron frame itself.
Write for our special booklets explaining this matter in detail.
We have recently put on the market the Beale Player-Piano. The Beale Player-Piano possesses the finest
mechanism it is possible to produce, fitted in a Beale high-grade piano of handsome appearance. The artistic possi-
bilities of the interpretation of a roll on the Beale Player-Piano are limited only by the artistic temperament of the
performer. The mechanism is so delicately regulated and every control so perfect that it is easier to play than any other
piano-player. ■ . ’
FREE LIFE INSURANCE : We supply, when requested, a Free Life Insurance Policy, without any charge
whatever, to buyers of Beale Pianos. This covers the life of the customer during the course of hire-purchase, and
insures a valuable and saleable asset to the family without further payment in case of bereavement. The Policy is a
purely free gift from Beale and Co., Ltd., so that no other person may claim under it than the person named by the
customer when accepted by us.
All Beale Pianos carry our written guarantee for Twenty-five Years.
A Beale Piano is lower in price, quality for quality, than any other piano you can buy, and in after cost it is
also cheaper, because it requires far less tuning and less frequent expert attention in every way.
PARTS : Should you by accident damage your Beale Piano we can always replace any injured or broken
parts at a very low cost to you, because we are the actual makers, with our factory facilities here in Australia. But if
you buy an imported piano, and it gets damaged, you will find it expensive to repair, because the agents have no fadlory
facilities here and they do not carry stocks of spare parts.

“J.J.C.”; The China boat was moored at
Darwin pier, and I was standing gazing at nothing
over the rail. Then my eye fell on my old Darwin
vegetable Chow as he squatted on his haunches, with
his basket of fruit and nuts on one side, and on
the other a clean sugar bag, with what
looked like dried tadpoles spread out on
it. On these dried tadpoles lie kept an
alert eye. Presently a great number of Chinese
swarmed on to the jetty and surrounded the Chow.
All their interests were centred on the sugar-bag and
the dried tadpoles. Before long-, an old Chinaman
bought 10, and handed a sovereign in payment, and
another bought one and gave 2s. I clambered
ashore with visions of cheap black pearls. I asked
my old cabbage merchant what they were, and he
told me the dried galls of the iguana. “Welly good
medicine,” he explained. “Cure him wind; any
thing. Plenty good.” I had often heard of the
virtues of iguana fat, but of the dried gall never.
The Chow sold right out before I left. And two
bob a time! Gimme the gun!
“Silas Snell” : The fire at Bode’s broke out
at four o’clock in the morning, and Jessup and
Hardy had a tough task, and a hot one, in getting
Mrs. Bode and the little Bodes up at so early an
hour, Bode being away on night-shift at the Si’ver
Star in Black Hill. However, the many Bodes were
rescued, and dressed in a few scant garments lent
by neighbors. Mrs. Bode sat miserably on a stone
by the fence, and watched her home go up in smoke
and flame. At about six o’clock Sandy Macdougal
came along- from his hut clucking sympathetically.
Sandy carried a kettle in one hand and a piece of
bread on a long wire fork in the other. “Eh, but.
lassie, yon’s a great peetv, a verra great peetv,
Ah’m theenkin’,” said he ; “but what’s done’s done, in
a manner o’ speakin’, and sich bein’ so, as it were,
Ali'm supposin’ ye’ll no mind if I pit th' kettle to
boil and be maekin' mesel’ a wee bit toast. Na?
That’s richt, lassie. It's always as weel, mind ye, t’
Mak’ the most o’ a bad job.” And Macdougall boiled
bis kettle and made his wee bit toast at the glowing-
cinders of Mrs. Bode’s burnt-out home.
“Sarto”: “Leo Lear” (B. 11/9/T3) wants
us to believe that almost everything that is, isn’t.
He says there is not a wood-pecker in Australia.
What, then, is the little brown bird that clings to
the trunk of a tree and deliberately pecks for his liv-
ing ? Is it the emu ? Our bell-bird is a beauty, and
a ventriloquist—the only ventriloquist in the bush,
I believe. When you hear his rich liquid-silvery
note don’t fall to the delusion that it is afar off,
because, usually, it is close by. Ours is a bell-bird.
If anybody else has another bell-bird, well and good.
That’s no reason why we shouldn’t have ours. When
one hears at night that weird, long drawn-out “cur-
lew” one can safely bet his socks that the uncanny
wail emanates from the curlew, and not the stone-
plover, as “Leo” would have us believe. Our curlew
is our curlew, and the plover is the plover. If, on
a dark night, “Leo” suddenly breaks the record high-
jump because of what he imagined to be a spook
flitting above him, he may know that it is merely
Mr. Plover hurrying by to keep an appointment with
his best girl. The plover is responsible for a sharj
piercing cry, said to be a sign of approaching rain.
Incidentally, I saw, the other day, a tiny wren pro-
viding for a little cuckoo about three sizes larger
than herself, that had been left on her doorstep.
The cuckoo builds no nest, but allows his missus to
lay her eggs in the nests of other birds. She’s such
a loafer that I’m not sure whether she even lays her
own eggs. Leastways, I call her and her old man
cuckoos. “Leo Lear” may possibly assure me that
they are really’ cassowaries or flying dugongs.
PUPPY’S GODFATHER.
ANGRY HOUSEWIFE : "Now, then, do you
want me to catl the dog after you?”
TRAMP: "Well, now, an' it wouldn’t be a bad
name, lady. Dusty David, Alum; an’
thank yer kindly."
NOT RESPECTABLE, CLEARLY.
MRS. MANGLES (after a long and fruitless inquisition into her neighbor’s back yard):
"It's my impression them people wot's just moved In must ’ave something to ’ide.
Why, I ain’t so much as heard a word outer them.”
“Gil Gunnia” : Outside of Camooweal, on
the border between Queensland and the Northern Ter-
ritory, there is a gruesome but interesting relic of
Brother Binghi’s former habits. In a pine scrub
there, built up among the branches and 10ft. from
the ground, is an elevated cemetery. Seven of the
“houses,” skewered on long- poles and thatched with
bark, remain; but all the former tenants have dis-
appeared. In these tree-“graves” Binghi's deceased
brother was nicely wrapped in bark and covered
with bush and sticks. All his earthly possessions
went with him except his wives, who were appropri-
ated by his blood-brothers; and a host of sorrowing
friends kept the evil spirits moving on. But Binghi
is a most sensitive person, who can’t stand being
laughed at, and as some whites laughed at his tree-
burial he promptly adopted the white man’s in-
sanitary methods, and now goes in for deposit under-
ground—just enough underground to swear bv, as a
rule.
"Gouger" : Here’s a bit of the creed of the
Bloomfield and Daintree river natives. In the first
place, Something made the world, said Something
being shrouded in mystery and not understandable
by the Wisest men. The bat was the first living thing
made. Of tireless energy, infinite cunning, it was
the foreman of Something, with a great task set it
to do. Next born was the moon, which threw out
light then as the sun does now. Then came the
eaglehawk. These three did tremendous things,
shifting- mountains on to the flat country, splitting
ranges in halves and forming rivers and ravines, mostly
to make travelling hard for the black man, who was
yet to come. These dirty tricks were purely mis-
chievous pranks on the part of the bat. But after
many things were done the moon became fat and
lazy, and gave out that it was time to sit down. He also
attempted to joy-ride with the bat’s sister. The
bat s whiskers bristled with anger, and after consul-
tation with the eaglehawk he snuffed out the light
of the insulter. For many days it. was dark, and
the bat went on the loose in the shadows. It was
proved, 100, that the eaglehawk had not been all
that the Hawks’ Social Purity Brigade could stand
for. Anyhow, the bat, after a recovery, became
anxious for work once more, and made the sun to
bring them light. Then the happenings in the dark
were made manifest. Out of chaos had come into
the world most amazing species. Prodigious animals,
great fish, mighty birds, tiny insects, lizards and
other creatures. The bat set to work untiringly to
mate all these strang-e creatures, and gradually dis-
tinct classes of animals and life were arranged, with
Black Brother as the lord of all. Then the bat, his
job complete, sat down and rested. And after a
long experience of his masterpiece I reckon he should
have rested much earlier.
“Celia Lloyd" : Sent a note out to a man
working at a N.S.W. North Coast dairy last week,
but it was returned by the owner of the farm, accom-
panied by the following ~
“Jim left las week an if you no a good man send
him out. We dont want none of yer hemigrand
coves, they dry off cows quicker as milkin masheens.
We would sooner pay a good astralain 15 bob as the
hemigrand ten bob. jim is doin for roylty. hurry up
if you know a man.”
I put it down that Jim had turned anarchist or
suffragette or something with bombs in its pocket,
until next morning I picked up the local rag and
found: “Royalty, Dark Bay, 15.2,” and so on down
to the usual “Every care taken,” etc., etc. Jim had
no attractions for me after that.
“A.G.” : Our N.T. survey party is work-
ing on a traverse of the Adelaide River—a large
stream infested with alligators. Adjoining the river
are some large billabongs frequented by- wild geese,
black and white, partly web-footed. I lately shot
one of these bipeds, and found he had a coil for a
windpipe: the thing made circles just under the skin
on the breast, before entering- the vital quarters of
the bird. When measured the coil was found to be
3ft. Bin. long. Docs any reader know whv and
wha ffor ?
* * • *
“Ess” : Let me enlighten “Leo Lear.” who
says (B. lfl/10/’l3) that he has watched the platy-
pus in many streams and seldom seen them going
with the current, and who asks, “Why don’t, mobs
of them get herded together at the source of rivers?”
Every platypus has a burrow in the bank of the river
or creek where he lives, and he never goes very far
from that. He doesn’t like sunlight, and must have
a dark home to retire to during the sunniest hours of
the day. He always swims up against the stream,
but if “Leo Lear” watches closely he will see duck-
bill feeding back along the water's edge, especially
where there are thick bushes hanging over the water.
In such sheltered places the animal feeds and sports
in the morning and late afternoon. Its habitat
ranges from Tasmania to Southern and Central
Queensland, including Vic., N.S.W. and S.A. So
tar, it has not been found in the Northern Territory.
“Leo Lear” also wants to know if there is any truth
in the bush belief that red robins and platypus in-
habit the same stretch of country. Red robins are
found in all the States and in many localities, in-
cluding right-up North, where a platypus has never
been seen.
“Eddyson” : Daniel Garry built the new
left wing- of his publichouse at Blue Jacket over one
of the many worked-out shallow alluvial claims tZ
perforated the district, because in Daniel’s oninkf
the bit of a hole made “the illegant cellar.’’ Dan Tel
was quite right; you could not have wished for
neater or more commodious underground apartment
foi the ot beer and things. The hob* «,
only about 9ft. deep, and the alluvial had been taken
out m a square block, leaving an oblong cave in the
pipeclay, well shored up with timber, cool d rvi
commodious. Garry let bis barrels down with
block and tackle; he ran neat shelves round ‘the
workings, and stocked them with bottled stuff
large quantities; and the beer at Garry’s came
below, cool and soothing in the hottest' summer dav"
It was about six months after the completion of ,V
new wmg that Mclnerney assumed the dimensions of
a public problem at Blue Jacket. It would seem that
Mae. had discovered the secret of perpetual inebria
tion. He got drunk just when he wanted to ami
remained drunk just as long as he liked, witho,,,
visible means or discoverable sources of sun il
Peter Mclnerney lived adjacent to Daniel Ga*rr V P D
an old log hut. He was a hatter, and called himself
a mining manager in the census paper, inasmuch
he managed his own mining, which consisted main j S
of fossicking adventures up C’ampoven Creek n
was not affluent for long together or for much at '
time, and his perfect and protracted drunks soon b '
gan to excite attention and remark. Drunks that
have no discoverable origin tannot escape general
notice in a place like Blue Jacket, where everybody
knows how much his neighbor’s got and how ’muei,
he holds. Mclnerney had nothing, and he held
great deal. It was a mystery to all; it was i!
matter of almost superstitious amazement to Daniel
Garry of the Sligo Arms. “Howiver d’ veh do ut
Mclnerney?” he would say, standing, his head on one
side, his chin clasped firmly in his right hand and
a look of suffering perplexity in his quaint limp.,
man face. “I don’t know at all. I do not. Here
v’are dthrunk ez a pickle, y’are, an’ divil a Vpenm
spent in me house. Is ut an inspiration, ’r a gift j v
God, ’r what?” Sometimes a whole committee of rl,.
citizens of Blue Jacket would gather round
Mclnerney as he lay in the open, vaingloriously airing
his condition, and hold a sort of inquest in the hope
of discovering the secret sources of Peter’s greatness
But Pete was the still, strong mail in a blatant land
His silence on this subject had a limitless profun-
dity. One day when Blue Jacket had almost
accepted the mystery as a dispensation of Providence
and past finding out, Daniel Garry unlocked his
cellar door and went below, seeking whiskv He
found Peter Mclnerney lying outspread on the pipe-
day floor. Beside him was a bucket, an ordinary
stable bucket, half full of beer, and a leaking bung
in the last tapped barrel explained how the beer
came in the bucket. Peter Mclnerney, too drunk to
apologise, was hauled up bv the head, and tumbled
into a typical summer day. Garry concluded that
he had sneaked into the cellar, and' had been locked
in ; but eight days later Daniel again found his neigh-
bor tumbled on liis cellar floor, infused to the limit
with strong drink, and this time Daniel knew the in-
vasion had not been effected by the cellar door. How-
had Peter Mclnerney broken and entered? A dire
misgiving flashed upon Daniel Garry. He rushed up
the ladder, and out to Mclnerney’s hut. Under a
Wagga rug on the floor he found loose slabs, and
under the slabs a shallow shaft with toe-holes. Down
that shaft Garry scrambled. A small drive, part of
it new made, led under the Sligo Arms, but it ended
in an abrupt and apparently solid wall of pipeclay.
Garry’s candle revealed no opening. Garry put his
hand to the wall to push, and went head over heels
through into his own cellar. The end of Peter
Mclnerney’s drive was a brown-paper partition very
cunningly coated with pipeclay. The mystery of
Peter Mclnerney s drunks was elucidated without
the aid of the Theosophical Society. As it happened,
his hut, too, was built over an old hole, and for two
years Pete had been using the lower hold of the
Sligo Arms as his private cellar.

either wrong or mistaken in saying that crow will
eat snake, alive, dead or otherwise. I have smelt
snakes in all stages of deadness, lying in all sorts ot
open places, even in times of tucker shortage in the
hush, but the crow has always ignored the wireless
call to his nose. And there was no shortage of crow,
either. Perhaps “Sumach” meant the ant. There
isn't a great deal of difference between an ant an'
a crow; not as great, for instance, as between an
ant and two elephants, as “Sumach” may observe
next time he takes his alpenstock and saunters into
the country.

Cask, of Brisbane and thereabouts, has developed
his unionism to a fine art. From close up to
Gympie on the north down to the Tweed on the
south, and from the ocean on the east to the range
on the west, Cork is in a brotherhood which not
only fixes the retail price of grog, but decides what
the members shall pay (nominally) to the brewers
and other wholesalers. Say Blue Snake rum can be
sold by the agents for 18s. a gallon. Tanglefoot’s
union interviews the agents and arranges that the
price shall be 255. ; the extra 7s. is to be a rebate,
to be allowed to Mr. Publichouse only, on a certifi-
cate from the association that he has adhered to its
rules. If he kicks over the traces, and sells any-
thing whatever for less than the price fixed by his
union, bang goes all his rebates, and bang goes his
chance of getting any further rebates until he has
obliterated his offence. It isn’t a ring, or a com-
bine, or a conspiracy or anything unpleasant like
that. It isn’t even a union ; the average Brisbane
Bung was, in fact, horrified at strikes even while, a
few months ago, under orders, he himself struck
against selling the usual brand of schnapps at the
old bottle-price, and charged another Is. for quarts.
It is none of these objectionabe things. It is merely
a trade-protection society. Blewrewin will tell you
so himself.

shouldn’t the Government take on the job ? The
Westralian goldfields used to be cursed with a firm
of Jew interveners who made fruit an infrequent
luxury to the dusty battlers. Staniforth Smith,
becoming mayor, built a municipal market, sent
his town clerk down to lecture to the Backbone of
the Country on the new situation, had the fruit
carted from the railway station daily, and sold
every morning by a municipal auctioneer to retail
greengrocers and barrowmen. Hayseed had only to
put his fruit on the nearest station platform and
address it to the municipal markets, Kalgoorlie,
and in less than a week he got the municipal
account-sales and cheque. No doubt it was an un-
warrantable attack on Vested Interests, but it re-
sulted in (1) a bigger supply of fruit at less cost and
(2) bigger cheques for the anti-Socialistic cocky. Now
that he has got to Papua the same Smith is up to
other mischief. With an eye to a better supply of
fresh food he has established a stud farm and four
or five Government plantations, which appear to be
doing well, contrary to all axioms of sound govern-
ment. While Judge Murray was in England Smith
also started a State hospital, since increased to three
hospitals. I merely mention these matters so that
Joe Cook can keep an eye on him, otherwise he
might be knocking the end out of the rest of the
great Liberal party’s pet theories.
* * * *
“Binnacle”: N.S.W. Full Court has upheld the
opinion of a magistrate that registered steam tugs
are liable to pay harbor and light rates, a matter of
Bd. per ton per year. The Act imposing these dues
was passed in 1871, but it was not until 1911 that a
bill was sent to John Brown, of Newcastle, for dues
alleged to be owing by the tug Stormcock. Brown,
who is Ma’s boss litigant, told the Navigation people
to go to Blazes; but, as there was nobody of that
name prepared, for the time being, to do anything
for. Brown, a stipendiary magistrate was applied to.
To John Brown’s astonishment this party upheld the
Department’s claim, and now his opinion is backed
by the State’s heavy-weight authority. Of course,
Newcastle’s millionaire can go to the High Court,
although, if he were to ask the backers of Duke
Foote for Melbourne Cup where he should go to, the
High Court would probably be the last place they
would suggest.

Poor Jack got a trifle back from the owners the
other day in Sydney. He was a mate who signed
on a ship owned by the Kethels. Anyway, they were
the proprietors as far as the subsequent proceedings
went. After the sailorman had been paid a month’s
wages, and before the second pay-day rolled round,
he was given notice to quit, and did so. But he
could get no satisfaction concerning the cash due.
It appeared that the ship had been sold by the
Kethels and another to purchasers who had made
default in payment, and the steamer was arrested.
Jack, after a while, got weary of going short of the
money he had earned, and, believing a boss in the
hand was worth two in the unknown, towed the
Kethels off to a handy magistrate and spun his yarn.
Then the other side spun its yarn, and the magis-
trate spun his. When he had finished, the Kethels
were urged to pay £lB 12s. for wages due, and
£2 16s. for Costs (w’ho’s al "ays holding out the
hat), or do two months’ hard labor, on the ground
that, as tne transfer of the vessel had not been regis-
tered, they were its owners.
* * * *
“Exile”: Mayor Hennessy, of Melbourne, set out
to base a claim to a knighthood on the overthrow
of the dust devil. And he failed. Now Cattanach,
one of Vic.’s irrigation commissioners, suggests
planting belts of tall trees across the Keilor Plains,
thousands in a row and miles and miles of rows. To
catch the. dust from the northern plains these trees
would need to be as high as the spire of Salisbury
Cathedral. Melbourne’s duet flies Heavenward 200 ft.
in a north wind, and no amount of local watering
or sweeping can keep it away. It is mostly dust
from dry plains, and not from dirty roads. The
only way to stop it is to put that northern country
under irrigation and closer settlement, placing people
there instead of sheep, and setting them to grow
fruit, vegetables and cereals. The dust would be
then employed raising food for the citizens instead
of choking and blinding them. No doubt we shall
have to supplement that to catch the local fiend. In
other countries the old-fashioned macadam is being
supplanted by concrete made with stone, sand and
cement. On a concrete road, mud and dust are im-
possible, and the road improves with age, so that it
can be kept in order for 6s. per mile per annum.
In Califoria, the roads are lightly covered with crude
oil, and when petroleum becomes plentiful in Aus-
tralia it will be used here, too. One reason of the
greatness of France as an agricultural country is
the country’s splendid highways, for which it has
to thank Napoleon. Nap. learnt this secret in his
campaigns in Italy, where the cement pavements of
the ancient Romans stand sound to-day in a country
where nearly everything else has crumbled and
decayed.

The foreign-owned tramway co. which carries
passengers between lialgoorlie and Boulder (W.A.)
is getting a surprise. A few months ago, the Arbi-
tration Court awarded the co.’s employees a wages
increase which did not amount to more than a few
hundreds a year. Immediately the concern’s officials
started a groan of poverty, and the service was put
on such short commons that a public howl was
raised. The Government railway, running parallel,
could have been used to help the people, but for
some unexplained reason it wasn’t. Then motor-car
owners saw their chance, and now ply regularly
between the two mining towns. As the road is
good and not over-crowded they can make quick
runs, and with fares sixpence each way there is
money in the business. No doubt the leather-headed
eo. is whimpering in London about the curse of
Labor rule in Australia. You can always back
Capital to find some curse on the premises when it
over-reaches itself and falls in.
* * * *
“Harbor Watch” (from an English shipbuilding
yard): The latest thing in ship construction is
weird enough to make any old shellback resolve
never again to drink anything stronger than 40 o.p.
rum. It is known as the Monitor Corrugated. The
corrugations run from stem to stern, and there are
about five of them. In dry dock these waves make
it look like an ordinary hull that someone has sat
down on before it has properly set. For this new
outline advantages are claimed far too numerous to
get into one paragraph. On the say-so of the
builders, the ship is steadier in a seaway because
the ridges lessen rolling ; there is an increase of 16
per cent, on speed, with the same coal consumption ;
and (though this bothers me) the hull holds 4 per
cent, more cargo. Also, there is no increase
of tonnage, no vibration, less eddy, more
strength, less propeller slip, and better steering.
The only advantage they appear to have overlooked
is the convenience to the barnacles, who will find it
easier to climb up the steps than mount a straight
up and down side.
* ■» * *
“Norbell”: These few insulting remarks I make
concerning the “handwriting expert” who gives such
confident testimony in the law courts. Again and
again some smug bank clerk, who has had a few
years’ experience checking and comparing signatures,
is sworn as a “writing expert,” and the liberty of
some poor devil in the dock depends on his ipse
dixit. In Melbourne, the other day, Justice Hodges
gave one of these lordly “experts” the following to
go on with: “You are brought here to help the
Court and jury, and now you have told us that you
came here with a view to finding everything you
could find against the accused, and not give the
jury a chance of arriving at an honest conclusion.
It means that you have shut your eyes to everything
that would tend to show that this was not written
by one of the persons charged, and open them wide
to everything that might show that it was.” Usually
the “expert” is asked to decide whether a mere sig-
nature was written by the accused, whom he has
never seen or heard of previously, and probably a
postcard, or a washing list, known to be in the
accused man’s handwriting, is solemnly submitted for
the humbug to base his opinion on. Years ago I
was a “writing expert,” inasmuch as I had been
checking signatures in a bank for a couple of years.
One of the clerks in that bank was tried for forgery,
and half a dozen of his fellow clerks, who had for
years been familiar with his writing, swore that a
certain letter was in the accused’s fist, “slightly
disguised.” I believe their evidence was given
honestly. Yet it transpired afterwards that the
letter was not the accused's, but was written by a
man who had only one arm, and the left arm at
that! Nine times out of 10 the evidence of hand-
writing experts should be treated with extreme
caution; the tenth time it should be met with
poleaxe.

“Strathloddon”: Re “Silas Snell’s” par (B
16/10/’l3), telling of successful gold-getting where
he believes only a goose would have looked for gold
In this burial ground of defunct mines (Castlemaine
Vic.) it is the usual practice, when a mine is sold
off, for the right to clean up in and around the
smelt house, battery, etc., to be sold as a separate
asset. As sometimes I thus gamble in others’ waste
and leavings, I’m one of the silly old ganders. Still
l make beer and other tucker, with sixpence left over
to buy my weekly sauce in a red wrapper.
* * * *
The porter’s yarn at the country pub:—
I'm getting 25 bob a week and tucker on this
job—leastways, I’m getting that from the boss
Last week, on Tuesday (Tuesday’s the busy day)
I harnessed up for 17 cockies; and 1 made a pound
out of that lot. The cocky isn’t a bad sort. He’s
better than the “commercial,” anyhow; that bloke
hasn’t much to give away. Different to the old
times, they’ll tell you, when they travelled around
with their four-in-hands and their grooms. The
cocky is all right, s’long as you get him with others
but they want a decent, liberal bloke to give ’em a
start. There’s old Mr. . If you could only
get a few cockies every day with him, the job would
be a gold mine. Take ’em singly, and when nobody’s
looking, they don’t part much. No 1 I never drink •
if you did you’d have to go in for a pint, instead of
getting the bob or half-dollar. My best week here
was £7 4s. 6d. (Show time), and I’m averaging
£4 10s. Certainly there’s the cap, but caps don’t
leave marks like leg-irons. I’ll climb out of it some
of these days, anyway, and be- a J.P., and buy a
farm —I got my eye on it. Yes, the job ain’t so
bad, only it wants looking after, mind you.
* • * •
Potatoes are giving such prolific crops this year in the
Cabbage Garden —£2 10s. a ton has been the ruling
wholesale price for “best” of late —that many growers
find it doesn’t pay to dig them if they live far from
the markets. Next season, of course, far fewer will
be planted out —with resultant scarcity of supply and
high prices. In both cases the fool farmer, who
won’t co-operate, gets little out of the business.
The Commonwealth Parliament could help these
people and others by following Germany’s example,
relaxing the Excise laws and regulations so that
when spuds become unprofitable as food they could
be turned into industrial alcohol —a policy which
the Fatherland finds pays. Kaiser Bill’s Government
also erects public stills in suitable localities.
* * * •
“O’Phimerty”: If you’re looking for a business
with big profits in it, my tip is second-hand book-
selling. A while back, having finished a course of
examinations, I had a set of standard books on my
hands. Also, I was, to put it in a pleasant way, in
very reduced circumstances. This concatenation (I
wish to use language that shows I passed the exam-
inations) led me to drop my books into a bag and
take them to a second-hand bookseller. He looked
at them while I waited, with an uncomfortable,
pawnbrokery feeling about me, and then offered me
a price so exiguous that it nearly pushed me through
the window. I commenced to argue, and he com-
menced to give the books back to me. Immediate
necessity is the mother of the Devil, so I had to
take his money. A few days afterwards I went to
his shop again. My books were nicely classified and
shelved, with the prices marked in plain figures. I
totted those prices up. The total represented an
advance of 265 per cent, on what he had given
me. And yet the plain figures stared at me naked
and unblushing.

HYMN 2198 CENTRAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh! in this holy vestibule
Teach me to watch 1 teach me to prey 1
Give us this day our daily fool —
To-morrow and each other day;
And to my aid in haste repair
Whether I be a “bull” or “bear.”
The she-bears that the Prophet called
To eat the naughty infants, who
Cried loud the fact that he was bald,
Did just the thing I’d like to do ;
I’d like those bears to tear in sport
The wicked men who catch me “short.”
Oh 1 saints, who sing by Jasper Seas,
Who lift the voices in three sharps,
Take ye my prayer among your pleas,
And sing it to your gilded harps.
The prayer. I pray twice every day:
“Let aIT the markets come my way.”
The stocks I “bull” make skyward rise,
And pay a dividend each hour,
That I may lift adoring eyes,
And publish wide Thy matchless power;
That I may sing Thy praises loud,
And bring to naught the other crowd.
The stocks I “bear” make earthward fall,
That I may “cover” them for naught;
And let them make a daily call
To ruin all the “bulls” I’ve caught.
Remember Thou the prayer I pray:
“Let all the markets come my way.”
And when a mine I do promote,
Let values stay, and lodes persist,
Until I’ve sold out of the float,
And given the tardy “bulls” a twist.
And at all meetings bf the Board
Be present at our table, Lord 1
N.s.w.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.

What a difference stropping makesl
Only those who have used an Auto Strop in comparison
with a non-stropping safety can tell just how much difference
there is—not only in the smooth, close shave which the
sharp stropped blade of an Auto Strop ensures, but in the
simplicity of its use also.
It takes far less time to strop an Auto Strop blade (and so keep it in the pink of condition)
than to put a new blade into a non-stropping safety razor. The Auto Strop is the only razor
that strops itself and consequently „ __ . __. e

POLITICAL
POINTS
The guillotining of the Representatives by
Jokook when the Postal Voting Bill was
being shoved along was made possible by the
absence of Labor-man Catts. Which is
another proof that when the Catts away
the rat will play.
If, 20 years or less ago, anybody had
said of W. J. Ferguson, who suffered prose-
cution and persecution on behalf of the
Broken Hill miners in the big strike of 1892,
that he would, in 1913, stand for a Barrier
seat as an anti-Laborite, the language would
have shaken Nebo’s lonely mountain. Never-
theless, that is the position.
Cable to the dailies: —
The President of China, Yuan Shih Kai, has issued
mandates dissolving the democratic Opposition, and
depriving 300 members of their seats in Parliament,
thus ensuring a constitution of the Legislature
according to his own desires.
"High-handed action,” they head this; and
some of them recall Yuan’s remark when
he did something similar a while ago: “It
may not be the English way, but it is my
way.” It certainly isn’t the Australian
way. As Premier Peake, of Adelaide, could
tell him, the Australian way of getting rid
of an awkward Opposition is by gerryman-
dering the electorates.
It is easier to apply the doctrine of the
survival of the fattest than of the fittest to
the first Cabinet of which George Reid was a
member. In those days he was a natty little
man, fond of a white tie, and if asked
whether to-morrow would be fine was ready
to debate the question from either side. Reid
was Minister for Education in 1883. Alex-
ander Stuart was Premier. Dead. George
Dibbs was Treasurer. Dead. H. E. Cohen,
afterwards on the Supreme Court Bench,
was Minister of Justice. Dead. W. B.
Dailey, Attorney-General. Dead. J. S. Par-
nell, Lands. Dead. F. A. Wright, P.M.G.
Dead. Joseph Abbott, Mines. Dead. Henry
Copeland, Works. Dead. Patrick Jennings,
Vice-President of the Executive Council.
Dead. George Reid alone survives. W. J.
Trickett was a member of that Cabinet, too,
but he was taken in late, and to fill a hole
accidentally punched in it by Jollity. It
was Henry Copeland who became post-
prandially excited; and Mrs. Grundy and
malevolence demanded his resignation. Stuart
therefore doublebanked, taking over Works
for a couple of months till Wright was ready
for the change. That left the P.M.G.-ship
open, and Trickett was then invited to step
in.
When Prime Minister Cook recently took
to _ firing his “closure” cannon-balls, Oppo-
sition-leader Fisher and his followers showed
little wisdom in protesting against the fusil-
lade. Better had they let Cook rush through
every bill he had on hand, in the certainty
that the Senate would coldly “review” this
“hasty and ill-considered legislation.” That
would hasten the decision that must be given
by the electors before any progress can be
made. As it is, Labor is made to appear
obstructive, dilatory and only anxious to
“play the game,” and the country is tired of
seeing the “game” played.
Australian Attorney-General Irvine made
it plain that he is not going after the Aus-
tralian tentacle of the Yankee Meat octopus
till “occasion arises.” Irvine is in the posi-
tion of a general who sees a hostile force
landing in his country and not only doesn’t
declare war but actually supplies it with
coin wherewith to carry on the campaign.
George Reid, at Melbourne last Monday,
remarked that the danger from the Beef
Trust was an increasing one, and went on:
“If the trust manages to knock out Aus-
tralian buyers, the pastoralists will find
they will have to pay back, in future lower
prices, every penny of the enhanced price
obtained when the trust first came on the
scene. These trusts are out to crush anyone
who competes with them.” In spite of even
George Reid’s warning, Irvine doesn’t, how-
ever, propose to do anything. He will just
keep on being an inert icicle until he can't
do anything.
THE APOTHEOSIS OF GEORGE REID.
The fact that it was Cup time had a
marked effect on the political situation of
Australia last week. For' once Cook had
the whole of his party on hand, and Fisher
was short of patts. So Cook was able to
continue his triumphant fandango on the
body of the Opposition while he whirled the
closure whip. But his troubles promptly re-
sumed business at their old address when the
lure of the Cup had vanished and the Bruce
Smiths began to suffer again from nostalgia.
According to press paragraphs, chairman
Piddmgton, who happens to be a lawyer,
is going to wear wig and gown at inquiries
made by the Interstate Commission into the
tariff and other matters. The Commission
is supposed to be a body of plain citizens
appointed to inquire on behalf of the other
citizens into such matters as whether it
isn’t advisable to put another penny duty on
glue. The job has no more connection with
Piddington’s law trade than it has with
his older school-mastering trade; in fact,
not quite as much. That being so, if Pid-
dipgton doesn’t think he is impressive enough
without some theatrical “properties,” The
Bulletin urges him to drop the wig-and-
gown idea and carry along a cane and black-
board.
No one ever suspected William McLinen,
the Knight of the Cloth-yard, of being a
humorist, but he proved his claim early last
week when he explained that, although he
was contesting the Willoughby (N.S.W.)
seat in defiance of Mr. Wade’s wishes, he
was still a loyal follower of Mr. Wade. In
other words, he would show his loyalty to
Wade by doing just what Wade didn’t want
him to do. Wade, no doubt, wonders if his
loyal follower does this before election what
sort of performance he will put up after-
wards.
The Sydney public the other day got a
first taste of a medicine it will have to take
a lot of presently—tramway fares to the
Randwick racecourse and other amusement
places were bumped up. These people were
the first to be tapped because, as it was
explained, “they don’t care what they pay.”
Sydney and suburban tramways gave a
poorer return in the last 12 months than
in any year in the past quarter-century,
excepting only droughty 1902 and 1903. Of
13 sections into which the tramways of the
State are , divided only two earned their
interest; and what surplus they earned
wasn’t quarter enough to make good the
money the others lost. Just on to
a million pounds of borrowed money was
spent on Sydney suburban and city lines
last year; yet the total earnings, after pay-
ing working exes., were £72.000 less than
in the previous year, before the million was
spent.
Melbourne got its first insight into the
peculiarities of the management of its In-
fectious Diseases Hospital about a year
ago, and Premier Watt is only now gradu-
ally piloting through Parliament a Bill to
put the concern on a business-like basis. If
he doesn’t hurry he’ll have something much
more troublesome than a dozen tired, inept
Bumbles to deal with, as certain of the non-
associated councils, which are supposed to
pay for patients sent from their districts,
and to recover the money from patients
or their relatives if they can, have
practically told the management it has
no legal status and can’t sue; and
that they will see it in Jehannud
before they will pay. The shortage at
present is over £lOOO, and the taxpayer will
doubtless have to foot the bill 4n the end.
It. would save a lot of bother, and about a
third of the money now subscribed by
charitably disposed or uncharitably dunned
citizens, if the general taxpayer were made
to foot the bill for all hospitals. The
Samaritan could still pass over his 2d., and
the Levite would have to pay his fair share
of the expense whether he passed by or
stopped at home.
Maldon Ilobb, apostle of Fat, discoursing
at Ballarat: —
A friend of mine, recently returned from Japan
tells me that in every school in that country the
largest map is Australia, and the children are
taught that Australia is the future home of the
Japanese people. 1 am glad both parties agree
defence is not a party question.
Mr. Maldon Robb did not add anything to
indicate that his particular party proposes
to start building the Transcontinental rail-
way from the North, so as to make things
easy for the Jap, when he does come to his
new “home.”
The Party Government curse is having a
great time in N. S. Wales just now. Citi-
zens who think they have a perfect right to
step forward and save the country are
told, when they make a move, that they are
not patriots, but traitors, because if they
stand for Parliament the vote will be split
and the other side will get in, and the coun-
try will be ruined. So the patriot drops
back, and the machine-made candidate steps
forward ; and the public votes not for the
man it wants but for the man the handful
of party wire-pullers have produced. De-
mocracy nowadays consists of government
of the- machine by the machine for the
machine.
The other day Tom Johnson, who bosses
the Ma State Railways and Tramways, de-
cided, in obedience to popular demand, to
place a screw-jack on every tram, so that
mangled human beings should not have to
bleed to death beneath a juggernaut when
they should be in the casualty ward. Sydney
was glad; but it is entitled to feel mad
when it learns that the whole order has been
sent abroad. A screw-jack is a very simple
thing to make. There isn’t an engineering
shon in Australia that can’t turn it out in
dozens —yet the order went abroad.
Still, what can you expect? The Govern-
ment that sacks good Australians and then
gives almost imperial authority to a
foreigner to replace them, encourages the
foreigner to think that Australia is a no-
account place.
With all his faults, Westralian Labor
Premier Scaddan has done a few good
things. He has established a Workers’
Homes scheme and numerous State industries
designed to either curb ravenous monopolies
or provide the public with pure milk and
grog and sundries. The pubs and the dairy
are so far the only concerns showing a
profit; but this is because Scaddan fights
with his fists stuffed into pillows. He has
contracted the habit of starting his enter-
prises with an air of apology and continu-
ing them with an air of pained resignation.
In fact, if it weren’t for the sturdy goldfields
crowd, it is likely that most of the new
concerns would never have been started at
all. What he needs is more backbone. With
that and the Government steamers, he might
have smashed the meat ring nearly a year
ago.
The privately-run “labor exchanges” in
Westralia have had a much-needed overhaul.
“Texas” Green, M.L.A. ror Ivalgoorlie, re-
cently disguised himself as a tramp, and,
having visited most of the registry offices,
gave the House his story. This way of ex-
posing an evil system was needlessly dra-
matic, because everyone knew that both in
Perth and Ivalgoorlie registry offices charge
disgracefully high fees, often resort to low-
down trickery, and occasionally run a Flos-
sie business as a side-line. Nevertheless
“Texas” is forgiven his melodramatics, for
he compelled the Government to take notice
of a sordid “industry,” which should have
been regulated long ago without any compul-
sion. The Westralian experience supports
that of the other States in teaching that the
mere existence of a Government Labor
Bureau is utterly insufficient to meet the
case.
Note from an old campaigner:—
It amuses me to read of the alleged desperate peril
that threatens N. S. Wales Liberalism from the incur-
sion of Independents such as William McLinen, Philip
H. Morton and Scott Fell. Every one of them will
voice the sentiments of the Sydney Telegraph
within a month or so of being returned to the Assem-
bly. Consider the analogy between the case of Onslow,
M.L.A., and (say) Morton, who is contesting Wooll-
ahra, amid shrieks of protest from the Pitt-street
cellar. Onslow found in Jessep, of Waverley, a non-
entity whose one political asset was the Liberal
nomination. Rejecting the idea of fighting Jessep
next time for the nomination, on the excellent
ground that the odds about the holder of the nomina-
tion were about 400 to 1 on, the Camden Park warrior
presented himself as an Independent. The “organisa-
tion” reasoned with him ; the Liberal press appealed
to his better feelings. In vain. He knocked the
unhappy banana-expert out in one round, and has
been, ever since, a staunch supporter of Wade. Philip
Morton-—a far more capable man than Onslow —is
opposing, in the person of Latimer, M.L.A., another
complete nonentity. The man in the average street
dose not know that Latimer exists. He is a
Woollahra haberdasher, and has never tackled a
political question of much greater moment than the
upkeep of his constituency’s roads. In the somewhat
unlikely event of Morton iicking Latimer, he (Morton)
will be just as “true a Liberal”—whatever that may
be—as Onslow or any other endorsed candidate. The
fear that is evidenced by the party bosses, both
Labor and Liberal, at the appearance of men like
Morton and Beeby, is not that they will vote the
wrong way in time of stress. The Beebys are as much
to be relied on for a Radical vote as the Mortons are
for a Conservative one when the numbers go up. It
is the Machine they are all worrying about. Every
Independent win is bound to represent a fresh nail in
the coffin of that anomalous and out-of-date contrap-
tion ; and with its dismantlement the jobs of a herd
of underground workers will be gone.
POSTERITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was no intention when the money was being
borrowed of paying it off in 1915. The problem of
repayment might be left for the larger population of
posterity. —Brisbane Courier.
' There is, as far as I can guess,
No reason we should feel distress
To think the bill for ships and guns
Into so many millions runs ;
If we would keep on facts our grip,
And stiffen out our upper lip,
We soon should clearly realise
We have no cause ter pipe our eyes;
Fer burdens of defence, sez he,
Exactly fit posterity.
And them as say there’ll come a slump
And give us all an awful bump
Had better hold their foolish row,
And suck the teat they’re holdin’ now.
It’s doubtin’ Providence’s grace,
And flyin’ in tIT Almighty’s face
To keep fer ever spyin’ out
Ter see if Slump is round about;
Fer Slump is just the thing, sez lie,
As orter suit Posterity.
And as to taxin’, all agree
It’s foolishness, as you can see;
For where’s the sense o’ loadin’ men
With foolish impersitions, when
Ter pass it on’s the easy way
That wins the fickle mob’s Hooray,
And sends us off, our troubles fled,
Ter press in peace our little bed ?
Fer taxin’s just the thing, sez he,
That’s bound ter suit Posterity.
Why will yer take the dismal view,
And say as things is lookin’ blue ?
If men would rage and worrit less,
And be content to leave the mess
To them who, cornin’ after us,
Would fix it up with little fuss,
They’d find there’s no iniquity
As couldn’t linger patiently
Until we rigged it up, sez he,
Ter settle on Posterity.

NOTIONS
Given a guarantee that Melbourne Cun
race would last 3min. 31sec„ anyone might have
backed Posinatus to stay in front all the way. The
fly-away gelding was expected to fail at the finish
of a fast-run two miles, as he failed in the Metropoli-
an ?' K , E P SO ?? handicap a month ago, and as he
had failed in the Sydney Cup last April. Everybody
knew that Posinatus could set the pace in a big
handicap over any distance from one to two miles,
but the shrewdest of the Sydney jockeys
-i ln c asang the son of Fortunatus and
Whakatiki as a non-stayer. His own pace
had always found him out in the straight
when one or more of his pursuers had bustled him
from the outset. He stayed in front to the bitter
end at F remington the other Tuesday, for the reason
apparently, that nothing had pushed him to his speed-
limit earlier in the race, and he had a bit left to
finish with after making all the running. The differ-
ence between 3min. 31sec. and 3min. 27Jsec., which
was Piastre’s time last year, is very considerable in a
test of endurance. Poseidon took 3min. to
win his Cup on a wet day, and Merriwee romped
through the mud in 3min. 36Jsec. ; but with those
exceptions Posinatus was the slowest winner in 16
years. It is probable that, if Sea Prince had been
given his head when he was running second to the
leader, and wanted to go faster, the result would
have been different. Posinatus would have spun
himself out. There’s a lot of luck in the uncertainty
. racing. But it isn’t often that a horse with a
liking for the lead is permitted to lead a compara-
tively slow-going procession in a Melbourne Cup from
first to last.
Beragoon’s utter failure in the two-miles race is
only one more proof that, to win a Melbourne Cup, a
real good young one is needed. It isn’t sufficient for
a double Derby winner to be the best three-year-old
up to 12 furlongs. The others may be not at all
slippery. Four Derby winners—Newhaven, Merriwee,
Poseidon and Prince Foote —have won the Cup within
30 years, and two of these had both the blue ribbons
to their credit. That’s all. Four other three-year-
olds have got home, but these carried less than the
regulation 7st. 61b., which was Beragoon’s burden.
Radnor had been originally handicapped at 7st. 81b.
All things considered, it is hardly a fair thing for-
any three-year-old to be put above the 7st. 61b. mark
when speedy five-year-olds like Posinatus are thrown
in at 7st. The gelding had earned a 101 b. penalty
for winning in Sydney before going south to capture
the Cup with 7st. 101 b. up. Minus his penalty he
would perhaps have gone faster and fared worse.
McLachlan’s excuse for Beragoon’s defeat in the
Cup was very artles.s. He started with the idea that
he would win if the pace was made merry, as usual,
from the jump off, but “it was a very slow race,
which did not suit Beragoon at all, for he did not
seem to get thoroughly going. So slow was the run-
ning that the horses rolled and bumped a good deal;
even the outsiders, the beginners in big racing, took
things easy.” Then, why didn’t McLachlan get his
mount “properly going” in the lead? As it was, the
colt came back to the birdcage undistressed. For that
matter, a dozen of the beaten horses, so called,
seemed less weary and distressed than the winner.
Of Sea Prince it can 6nly be Said that he blew out.
The English horse was splendidly positioned for win-
ning the Cup if he was equal to the job. He was
never more than two or three lengths behind the leader.
When the time came for him to make his run, he
either declined to do it, or he hadn’t a run to make.
It was Sea Prince, the alleged stayer, who failed most
conspicuously at the business end of the journey.
Posinatus was one of the V.R.C. handicapper’s little
mistakes. The unlovely gee had to carry 7st. 121 b.
in the Epsom, and 7st. 101 b. in the Metropolitan,
but his original Melbourne Cup weight was 7st.
only. In fact, the V.R.C. handicapper treated
Posinatus as a mere sprinter, although he had won
the 10-furlong Birthday Handicap, at Newcastle,
giving to the runner-up, and was placed fourth
in last Sydney Cup. Melbourne people were think-
ing of Posinatus as one that had got off too
lightly, so the 101 b. penalty for winning City Tat-
tersali’s Handicap, at Randwick, was regarded as a
fair thing, though it left him still with the best of
the weights, in comparison with the penalised
Aurifer and Cagou. Some of his not-very-numerous
backers won their money through a mistaken idea
that he must be a son of Positano, whereas he got
the last two, and not the first two, syllables of his
name from his sire, Fortunatus.
The belauded Sea Prince is something worse than
a sour-tempered nag. He is first cousin to an out-
law. His temper explodes in strange noises. On
Cup Day, when he was gently led to his saddling
pen, an hour before the race, he jibbed and kicked
and barked, and was then taken away into the open,
where he walked around quietly enough. Sea Prince
grunts and roars in his rage. On one occasion, when
he was at the starting-gate, with Turner on his back,
the beast stuck his toes into the ground and
squealed like a spoilt kid.
The holiday crowd at Flemington on Cup Day
got its only gleams of real sunshine when the
trusty Bullawarra won the Hurdle Race, and the
favorite, Dunloe, won the Steeplechase. The Clip
winner had, of course, a sprinkling of backers, mostly
visitors from Sydney, and a few punters saved them-
selves by putting a bit on Ulva’s Isle for a place.
But 95 per cent, of the crowd came to grief on
the big event. It was one of the rare Cups in
which none of the placed horses had run first or
second in the A.J.C. Derby, Metropolitan or Caul-
field Cup. “Form” was put to confusion, and when
“form” is confused the public is generally con-
founded.
Age cannot wither Matouree’s aptitude
for putting in his best work at 14 furlongs. The
old battler pulled off the V.R.C. Handicap last
Saturday—a 6 to 1 chance —in accordance with The
Bulletin's suggestion that he and Hallowmas were
a pair of likely ones. It was Matouree’s second vic-
tory in the same event, and the third time he had
been placed. The distance suits. He won the
Waverley Handicap (14 furlongs) at the recent
A.J.C. Spring meeting, and it was on the strength
of that belated return to form that the veteran was
backed down to 2 to 1 for the Hotham Handicap on
Vic. Derby day—and failed, as favorites are wont to
do. The charitable assumption is that the ex-
Victorian had not then begun to feel the benefit of
the return to his native air. And the extra distance
was a consideration, of course. Anyhow, the “rever-
sion of form” could hardly be called startling, seeing
that The Bulletin had anticipated it.
Sea Prince, who won the Williamstown
Cup on Monday, had already accounted for the
Veteran Stakes on Oaks Day in quite the style of the
racehorse he is alleged to be.
* • * * *
Racing men are usually illogical, and the
stewards of Williamstown (Vic.) R.C. are not ex-
ceptions. At the meeting the day after Oaks Day
reports reached their ears as to Loch Maben, which
started in the Hurdle Race at 2 tq 1, and finished
third, a score of lengths behind the winner. The
stewards desired owner C. J. King (N.S.W.) to
bring the moke along for investigation, and, on his
curtly refusing, commandeered the beast, as per regu-
lation, and Overhauled him. They then discovered
that whereas his hind feet were shod with the
customary aluminium plates, his fore hoofs stood on
fairly heavy iron ones. On that they disqualified
owner and geegee for life, and promised to hold a
further investigation the following Tuesday, when
other bricks might be expected to fall. It was cer-
tainly an unusual sort of caper, but it is hard to
see why the horse was disqualified. He certainly
didn’t run as was expected, but it wasn’t his fault.
If he had had his way he would probably have raced
without shoes at all.
* * * *
J. Chambers, the temporary owner of
Posinatus, having leased the five-year-old from his
real owner, early this year decided on a long shot at
the Cup. Having taken that step, he invested a few
hundreds at the long prices then going, and set him-
self to win the goblet. And the rain fought
for him, and gave him the sort of course the gelding
likes. So he won, and the win brought him, it is
said, somewhere about £32,000.
The most outrageous record held by any
Cup horse is that of Golden Shore. This 5-year-old
imported mare has been started by her infatuated
possessor in the Epsom, Metropolitan and Caulfield
and Melbourne Cups, and has finished at the very
end of the procession in all four events.
The biggest Cup winner, perhaps, was a
Yarraside money-lender and ex-pawnbroker. He
backed the Aurifer—Posinatus double to win him
about £36,000 at 600 to 1. Israel only knows
how he stumbled across the tip. Aurifer was more
or less understandable, but Posinatus!

The Fourth round of Sydney First-Grade
Cricket ended in wind and dust that blinded
and parched. In spite of its splendid start of 335
for eight wickets, Glebe only drew with Gordon. Its
lifted its total to 360 ; but with the help of Trum-
per’s 157 not out, Gordon smacked up 260, and at
the close had only six wickets down. University,
74 ahead on the first innings, dismissed Sydney for
a paltry 111, then knocked up 39 for one wicket,
and so won utterly by nine wickets and
two runs. Western Suburbs, with a lead
of 109 on the first innings, closed, and went
for a full-point victory. Fortune clung to the brave ;
Middle Harbor’s second effort was crushed for 66,
leaving the Western team on top by an innings and
40 runs. The previous Saturday saw Balmain only
98 behind Redfern with two wickets down. The
golden promise was, however, not redeemed, and the
innings ended for 191, and gave victory to the
Tattered Suburb by 21 on the first innings. Peter-
sham, too, had to be content with a first-innings win
from Paddington by 79 runs. North Sydney versus
Central Cumberland was a curious affair. The previ-
ous week-end Central Cumberland, all out for 80, dis-
missed North Shore for 61 and made 46 without los-
ing a stick in the second innings. Last Saturday they
lifted the figures to 241 for four, closed, and tried
to hurry North Sydney through the second crushing.
But Middleton smashed and bashed 119, and when
day died North Sydney had made 201 and lost only
four sticks, so Central Cumberland won by 19 on its
first shocking innings. Talk about the irony of fate!
JUMPING JEHOSHAPHAT!
After training on a dozen cigars daily the
American jumping devil Stone cuts loose and

Sydney Stadium.
In the third round of Vic. Pennant
cricket, which finished on Saturday, all the
games were won on the first innings. And all were
won comfortably, except that between East and
’Varsity, in which the Students, or at least
three of them, managed to scrape together 195
to East’s 217. North hurriedly ran up 346 for
five wickets on the first day; then, declaring, they
put Essendon through for 135, and three for 86 in
the second innings, thus winning on the first by
211 runs. Carlton, with 214, found Northcote a
tougher proposition than it expected, and could only
get two points by putting it through once for 15i.
Richmond had little difficulty in beating P’ran’s
first innings’ 148, and declared at nine down for
271, with a distant hope of rushing P’ran through a
second time. The hope failed to materialise. ’Wood
collided with its old enemy, ’Roy, and made 62 —
an apology for a score. ’Roy responded with 202,
which hardly constituted the soft answer that turneth
away unpleasantness. ’Wood has sustained some
severe wallopings from ’Roy of late years, both at
cricket and hoofball, and its committees are wanting
to know why. Certainly ’Wood won last season’s
pennant in the final game with its neighbor, but
that is its only victory in a long succession of
defeats.
THE NOSE-RING.
A RAID ON THE RING BY MELBOURNE
POLICE.
PROMINENT BOOKMAKERS ARRESTED.
—Daily paper headings.
The Maoriland Rugby army in Western
U.S.A. is having a triumphal progress. Up to the
end of last week the wanderers had played and won
11 matches, and piled up 423 points against three.
These were scored by California University when it
was grassed by 37 to a trio. So far, great glory
attaches to California University for having made
that three.
* * * *
Queensland also had a Cup and a Derby
last week, and the event attracted a record crowd
to the Ascot Course (Brisbane). Unlike the Mel-
bourne boil-over, the double event went to the flying
hoofs of the same pracl, Signal Lamp, which started
favorite and lifted its followers to comparative
affluence.
Although the handicappers at Ulmarra
(N S.W.) “Hundred” asked James Paddon to con-
cede anything up to 60sec., the Australian champion
was not out of it by a long chalk. He put up an
excellent performance, and filled third place. The
final landed the coin to J. Vining (60sec.), with G.
Green (50sec.) between the winner and Paddon. The
Ulmarra is the first of a series of N.S.W. Northern
Rivers handicaps which should help to keep the
sport healthy.
Sydney Yacht Squadron was to have sailed
an ocean race on Saturday for the Gascoigne Cup.
But the weather reports counselled caution, so the
fixture was cut out as an ocean race, and a new
course laid down in the waters of Port Jackson. As
it was, the blow was very fresh indeed, and the
water very bumpy crossing the Heads. From the
fall of the flag, Muston’s White Wings looked a
winner, and it was even so, that elegantly-named
craft romping home ahead of Petrel and Sayonara, in
that order.
* * « *
That sometime-idol of Paris, Samuel
McVea, who seems to have lingered superfluous on
the Australian fistic stage, bobbed up at Lismore
(N.S.W.) on Friday night in a boxer versus jiu-jitsu
exhibition. The Japanese art was represented by
“Professor” Stevenson, and the conditions called for
seven bouts. Stevenson won four in
sion, forcing McVea to tap the sign of surrender.
In the fifth the triumphal progress came tgf a sudden
end. As Stevenson grabbed the crouchjj>g McVea by
the neck, that magnificently ugly nigger suddenly
straightened up, swung Stevenson off his feet and
smote him hard and often with both fists. Steven-
son backed off. McVea followed him up and floored
him three times. But the “professor” was game, and
came up once more, and though very groggy, again
dragged McVea to the floor with him. There, Samivel
got a chance, and showered wallops. The “pro-
fessor” turned over on his face and Samivel outer]
him with three poleaxe blows. The crowd is said
to have sniffed, as it considered that Samivel could
have done it before, but wanted to give good value
for the price of admission. Some people are hard to
please. The writer sniffs also, as it is absurd to re-
gard it as a test of the value of either art as a means
of self-defence. The fact that the “professor” downed
a man like McVea four times in quick succession is
fairly convincing. The unfortunate jiu-jitser had
to stand the risk of a knock-out, whereas McVea had
merely to tap surrender. Had Stevenson been allowed
to use the jiu-jitsu knock-out, Samivel would probably
have stayed in Lismore permanently—quietly quar-
tered in the cemetery with a broken neck. This
sort of contest is a farce, and a mighty unedifying
one; likewise, one that should be prohibited.

There was cursing and gnashing of teeth
among Sydney pigeon-fanciers lately. On October 25,
at Hay, 500 birds were liberated to race to Sydney
over an air line 360 miles long. Bad weather came,
and apparently blew the birds so far out of their
course that only three arrived on schedule time.
During the following days stragglers continued to
make their lofts, but hundreds are still missing.
On Saturday an even worse disaster occurred. A
race had been arranged from Mildura (Vic.) to Syd-
ney, and over 1000 birds were sent from the Harbor.
This covey was swelled to over 1200 by consignments
from Camden, Bowral, Goolamon and Cootamundra,
and the whole lot were liberated at Mildura between
five and six o’clock on Saturday morning. The dis-
tance is 508 miles on the air-line. At the time of
starting the weather was ideal, but somewhere along
the line of flight the birds ran into contrary winds,
and not one of the Sydney covey had homed bv sunset
on Saturday. If it turns out as badly as the Hay-
Sydney flight, the lofts will be depleted.
In a friendly family action in Equity,
“Lebbv” Hordern has been permitted to purchase his
late father’s yacht, Bronzewing, for £5OOO.
Cup week in Melbourne was also the week
of mighty bashing, two championship battles follow-
ing one another in quick succession. The first was
the Mehegan-Wells encounter, described in last issue ;
the second was that which resulted in the deposi-
tion of Bill Lang from the heavy-weight champion-
ship of Australia, by Dave Smith, of Sydney. It
was a stirring encounter, but it was also the old
story: moderate hitting power and speed triumphing
over heavy hitting power without speed. Smith was
fast enough to elude or duck past Lang’s long,
straight left, and anticipate his right; also, he was
strong enough to stand what battering Lang could
ladle out, and bear up against the frightful dis-
parity of weight for the long iourney of 20 rounds.
Lang weighed 13st. 111 b. to Smith’s list. 91b., and
so had 301 b. extra of solid meat and toughened
muscle to hurl against his foe. This writer doubts
if Lang fought up to the standard of other davs
certainly he was so painfully slow that, when he
had Smith rocking, he was unable to finish him
Feeling his glory ebbing from him towards the enl
of the fight, Lang went in for a knock-out That
is to say, he took risks in order to score the decisive
wallop. In return, he reaped merely a harvest of
blows that gave his foe many points, and at the
end of the time was a badly-battered, weary fighter
who had lost all but honor. When referee Lawless
placed his hand on the noble brow of Smith, he did
it amidst the applause of some 12,000 onlookers.
Now that Dave Smith has conquered Lang
and won the championship of the continent, there
is no one here left for him to overthrow, ’so the
Stadium is endeavoring to find him a victim of mark
by importing Eddie M'Goorty, who defeated him in
the United States. ln
The return fight at Melbourne between Sid
Burns, the Hebrew, and Arthur Evernden, the Eng-
lishman, was disappointing, The Englishman was
apparently, not in gdod form, or had got his tail
down, or something, and failed utterly to be either
effective or interesting. Burns was equally dreary
and the referee repeatedly admonished them both to
fight more vimfully. At the beginning of the 14th
round Evernden’s towel was thrown in, otherwise
referee Fullalove would probdbly have declared them
both behind on points at the natural end off the thing

The Stone-Summers fight at Sydhej'
Stadium on Saturday night was an interesting ernf-
fiicc, in which brute force, hitting power and fanati-
cism were ranged against dazzling speed, quick wit,
cunning and very limited hitting power. Sol
although Summers had already been defeated at
Brisbane by Stone, the wise ones offered three to one
against the latter. Stone was first in the ring, and
for nearly 10 minutes he sat there awaiting Sum-
mers. His attitude was one of utter dejection; he
looked an excellent model for a study of Judas
Iscariot after he had returned the money. A burst
of cheering caused him to look up and see Summers,
still in jersey and trousers, climbing through the
ropes. Stone was chewing gum. A smile flickered
across his sallow face ; then he huddled up once more
while his opponent languidly undressed. If he
thought to induce nervousness by the delay, Summers
had brought his pigs to the wrong market. Stone
came out chewing gum. He was long, lithe, Hebrew
(and from New York!). He wore loose trunks of
green sateen, which gave a ghastly tone to his trans-
parent, sallow skin. A rather handsome Jewish face,
black curly hair and a Sphinx-like expression com-
pleted the picture. The fair-haired Summers was
of the beautiful pink that indicates the perfectly-
trained Anglo-Saxon. His splendidly modelled limbs
were shown to best ' advantage in his tight-fitting
trunks, and his blue eyes glittered. He weighed
lOst. 21b. to Stone’s 9st. ll^lb. —so he had the
weight, he had the punch, and he firmly believed
he had the Most High behind him.
Remembering how Stone had out-generalled him at
Brisbane, Summers came prepared to take anything
so long as he could get in a body blow that would
wing his fleet opponent. He wanted to get his terrific
punch home in Stone’s wind, and then rough him
out. He was there to win—with the help of God, if
possible; if not, by any old means. The man who
realised it best of the 15,000 present was Stone.
He was caution itself. He was the swinging door in
excelsis. He was fast as he was light; poised on
his toes, he hovered with all the aery grace of Wells.
Summers could not hit him with effect. Even when
he worked Stone into a corner or on to the ropes, the
Hebrew came in and smote him on the nose with the
left, and before he could recover his aim the Jew
had clinched, so that his terrific swings were light as
baby taps for lack of distance. Usually, when Sum-
mers gets into holds, he swings his head in such a
way that if the Lord permits a collision, it is the
other’s face that gets the mark. On Saturday nighi
Summers resorted to his esoteric pugilistic craft at
once. But the other fellow knew too much, and it was
Johnny’s face that got cut. When Summers tried to
palm his opponent's chin back in the clinch, or get
his elbow under the jaw, Stone would wriggle out
and leave the trick exposed. And then he would
return the trick with interest. The sight of a Jew
paying interest moved the crowd to cheers..
As the fight went on, Stone became more elusive,
yet more aggressive. He bounded into the air and
crashed on the nose of Summers with the left. Once
he came down from the sky and right-crossed Sum-
mers so that he literally rocked. He was the .lump-
ing Jehoshaphat—a sneering, smiling Mephistopheles
chewing gum. For every trick that Summers had he
had a foil, and used it spectacularly. In one awful
round he smote Summers seven times, on the nose.
He bashed the gash on Summers’s right eye with
merciless precision. In-fighting found him just as
clever as the long-range hitting, and he landed
uppercuts by the half-dozen. Could he but hit he
were a world-beater indeed. Whole rounds passert
without Summers landing a single blow ; and at last
he stood, with blood-stained face, gazing helplessly
at the bounding, sneering, gum-chewing devil who was
always out of reach. But his reverie was cut short
by another lightning-like charge and a smack on the
nose. In the 16th he did manage to slop in one or
two heavy ones to the body and one to the ;J aw
shook the leaping phantom rather badly. Then bto
slowed down and husbanded his strength for tn
whirlwind finish. And a hurricane finish it was, in
which Summers strove desperately for a knock-*
the only thing that could retrieve the fight. But “■
had no hope. When referee Scott placed .his hand
on Stone’s head that youth bounded three times l
the air, leaped wildly from the ring, ,K lsS j d his
hysterical Jews, and left Summers s blood and n
own chewing gum over their faces.
THE PEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“lou back the P’s to win the Cup,”
Said Jones; “they always win it!”
I looked the list of runners-up;
Thought I: “There’s but one in it;
Prince that’s a P—Prince of the Sea,
A good-class, highly-tried ’un ;
In Prince Foote’s footsteps he will gee,
In those, too, of Poseidon.
Parisian’s another one,
And then, again, Piastre.
I’ve found the P—Persimmon’s son 1”
I dreamt not of disaster ;■
But so it turned out. Cursed be
My thinking-apparatus—
Prince of the Sea was not the P;
The pea was Posinatus.

“Mr. Ocky” : For the third year in succession Gee-
long has won the Australian highest-grade band
championship at the Ballarat Eisteddfod, each time
with a different band. In 1911 St. Augustine’s
Orphanage boys did it—not for the first time, either,
for they were also at the top in 1906. The Munici-
pal won in 1912, and this year it is the Harbor
Trust men. With a population of 30,000 the Corio
Bay settlement thus has three champion bands. Har-
bor Trust also won the big A.N.A. band contest at
Melbourne in January, 1913. Likewise the choral
championship at Ballarat this year was won by
Geelong; also the individual vocal championship for
best aggregate; and the Scottish pipers skirled into
second place. Geelong is wearing an extra size in
hats these times.
“Norbell”: It is so unusual to see a playbill posted
on the side of a vegetable John’s cart that 1
inquired whaffor at Wellington (N.S.W.), the other
day. It was an advertisement for “Quo Vadis,” and
in the evening I went to see the show. A portly
and prosperous-looking Sum Kum Fat was casting
a managerial eye over the “front”; a slant-eyed
Sung Ping Pong sold me my ticket; and the oblique
optics of Ho Ki Pat peered from the operator’s
box to see if his projection was satisfactory. Later
I had a conversation with Sum Kum Fat, and
remarked that it was a good picture. Said my
celestial friend: “Oh, welly good! Mo’ better you
come bimeby nex’ week. Welly good Aim, Cleopatla,
welly good, my word!” But I was in new pastures
before Cleopatla had arrived.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos the development
of playbills, etc. (B. 23/10/’l3). This writer has
playbills of September, 1872, covering Lyster and
Cagli’s opera season, at the Victoria Theatre, Syd-
ney. They are of four pages each, size llin. x
Biin. ; with many advertisements, some light read-
ing, a few reminiscent pars and the opera cast. They
are named “The Entr’ Acte.” Likewise, he has a
file of “The Chorus,” of 1880 and onward, edited
by the late S. H. Banks. His treasures in the way
of playbills include four of performances given at
Windsor Castle by command of the late Victoria.
They have each an illuminated cover, of tasteful
design; then the playbill proper, on perforated-edged
letter-paper; and on the inner part of the back
cover the names of the guests inviced to be present.
Beyond the immediate members of the Royal Family,
no two audiences were alike. The dates and plays
are: Thursday, January 4, 1849: “Used Up,” with
Charles Mathews, Granby, Bellingham, F. Cooke,
Howe, Honner, Clarke, Mrs. Jacob Barrow (late Miss
Julia Bennett) and Mrs. Humby; “Box and Cox,”
with Buckstone Harley and Mrs. Stanley. January
11: “Hamlet,” by Diddear, C. Kean, W. Farren,
Howe, Leigh Murray, Conway, Boyce, Alfred Wigan,
J. Howard, Clifford, Brindall, Vandenhoff (The
Ghost), G. Cooke, Clarke, Mrs. Warner, Mrs. Charles
Kean, and Mrs. Saville. January 18: “The
Stranger,” Charles Kean, Creswick, Howe, Compton,
Keeley, Webster, Lambert, Miss Clark, Master
Meadows, Miss Kean, Miss Chapman, Mrs. Charles
Kean, Mrs. Gill (late Miss Fanny Vining), Mrs.
Keeley, Mrs. German Reed (late Miss P. Horton)
and Mrs. Caulfield; “Twice Killed,” by Keeley,
Howe, Braid, Rogers, Clark, Coe, Mrs. Buckingham,
Miss Mesient, Mrs. Keeley January 25: “The House-
keeper,” by C. Kean, A. Wigan, Buckstone, Web-
ster, Boyce, Cullenford, O. Smith, Worrell, Munyard,
Lindon, Mrs. Kean, Mrs. Humby, Mrs. Clifford ;
“Sweethearts and Wives,” by Frank Mathews, Boyce,
Conway, Wright, Cullenford, Mrs. Gill, Miss
Woolgar, Mrs. Frank Mathews, Miss Ellen Chaplin.
The director was Charles Kean; assistant director,
George Ellis; prompters and stage managers, Fred
Webster and J. W. Gallot. Thos. Greive was the
scenic artist. A little gem, as a playbill, is one of
1872, for the Victoria Theatre, Sydney, “Under the
patronage of the Earl of Belmore and the Countess
Belmore.” “London Assurance” was played, with
Morton Tavares as Sir Harcourt, supported by
George Darrell, W. J. Holloway, John Howe, Harry
Power, William Andrews, Douglas, Melville, Flex-
more, Mrs. Robert Heir (as Lady Gay), Madame
Milthorp and Miss Melville. A musical interlude,
“Dame Europa’s School,” was supplied by Tom
Margetts, and the “Slasher and Crasher” farce by
Andrews, Power, Howe, Douglas, Sweeney, the Misses
Melville and Montague. This bill is printed on per-
forated-edged notepaper, and is one of a few dis-
tributed in the Governor’s box.
“Vagabond”: I’ve just had a dash over to Paris,
and wandered one night into the Folies Bergeres
(which, I may explain for the information of the
wives of those readers who know their Paris, is a
place where a sort of church-bazaar and Sunday-
school entertainment is carried out, and holidaying
church-wardens, taken in). There was a flicltergraph,
and, as this was a part of the show which my know-
ledge of the French language allowed me to enjoy, I
waited and absorbed the lot. The usual printed notice
on the screen announced that the next picture was the
laying of something ; but before I could find out if it
was an egg-laying competition or the French bookies
laying the odds, or a grisette or mignonette (French
for housemaid) laying the table, or the plombier
(plumber) laying on Peau (the water), on flickered
the picture, and to my joyful surprise I found my-
self watching the ceremony of the laying of the
foundation-stone of the Bureau du Commonwealth
(Commonwealth Offices) in Le Strand, Londres
(London). For a moment I was tempted to vapor
mes emotions (air my feelings) in a cri (cry) of
“Coo-ee,” but not knowing the French for the word,
and fearing that le garcong (the waiter) might misin-
terpret the call as an order and bring me an absinthe
(lemonade), I restrained myself and yelled encore.
I may mention that, in spite of this restraint, the
waiter brought me my fifth absinthe, and insisted on
saying, in villainous English, although I told him I
spoke French, that I had called for the “same
again.” It is pongsive, n’ce pas (sad, is it not?)
that the French do not understand their own lan-
guage better.
“C. Ockney” : Says Beerbohm Tree in his recently-
published book, “Abuse of the public is the last
ditch of the disappointed.” If this be true, and I
don’t know why it shouldn’t be, Bernard Shaw is a
very disappointed man; for the London public won’t
take his “Androcles and the Lion” seriously. The
laughter of the first night, being repeated every
evening, has at last so offended the Pshawthor that
in the Pall Mall Gazette he speaks of “a sense-
less, incontinent, indecent, irritating, ill-mannered,
maddening guffawing and brawling, that all but
ruined a carefully-prepared performance.” Finally
the great advertiser sends this message to the British
playgoer: “If you want to enjoy yourself at the
theatre, hold your silly noise.” To which the
public seems disposed for the moment to tell Pshaw
that what really is the trouble is that his own “care-
fully-prepared” noise is silly.
To Forbes Robertson’s complaint that he couldn’t
get the terms he wanted for an Australian tour, -T A.
E. Malone, London representative of J. C. William-
son Ltd., replies that Robertson’s repertory has been
“played to death in Australia, and, as he has no new
plays to offer, we cannot afford to give him the
terms he requires. We shall share his regret if he
cannot go. No one doubts that he would be a
success, artistically and financially; but if we con-
ceded his terms, 'we have our doubts whether our
share would anything like cover expenses.”
The success of the Scottish dialect drama, “Buntv
Pulls the Strings,” has prompted a Welsh piece on
similar lines —“The Joneses.” It pictures life and
character in a little AVelsh village, to which comes
an Englishman who plays Sheol among the villagers
and gives them a taste from his large collection of
forbidden fruits. Matheson Lang plays this part,
and Heaven only knows what his ecclesiastical con-
nections will say about it.
While Bernard Pshaw was still busy rehearsing
“Androcles and the Lion,” it was announced that
he had completed another play in five acts, which he
intends to call “Pygmalion.” “Absolutely no sex
interest,” he says-—“merely a study in phonetics.”
The scene is the porch of St. Paul’s Church, Covent
Garden, which is under the shadow of the big opera
house where Melba and others warble, and where
fancy-dress balls are held when opera is off. Under
the "church portico at midnight a number of fancy-
ball revellers take refuge from a rainstorm, and as
each arrives a mysterious, phonetic voice, that nobody
can locate, gives a truthful summary of that per-
son’s career. It’s a good idea, with humorous
possibilities, strongly reminiscent of W. S. Gilbert;
but it is hard to see how even the wordy Shaw is
going to make five acts out of it.

Our experiment of a couple of years ago of taking the wholesale catalogues of the great English
Manufacturers of Electro-silver and Solid Silver goods, and deducting 20 per cent., or 4/- in the
£, from their prices, was of a revolutiona character, and might have landed us in heavy loss,
but IT DID NOT,
owing to our great output, and so we are continuing the Discount.
It only gives us a bare commission on many lines, but commissions count if numerous enough.

For that wide-awake feeling
No one should be blamed
for over-sleeping any more
than blamed for walking
in his sleep.
Man is only partly con-
scious when he first opens
his eyes after a heavy
sleep. He needs help to
get wide awake at once.
Most men would get up
on time if they only real-
ised the time.
Big Ben makes them realise
it. Thus all who have his help
get up. Try it on yourself.
It will help you to get down to
work on time if you let Big
Ben help you out.
Big Ben is two good alarm clocks
in one —a long alarm that rings for 5
minutes continuously, and an inter-
mittent alarm that rings for 10 min-
utes at half-minute intervals. He
stands 7 inches tall. He’s massive,
well poised, triple plated. His face,
is frank, open, easy to read —his keys
large, strong, easy to wind.
Now if you sleep soundly —and you
do if you are a hard-working man-
use Big Ben. He’s made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S.A., by Westclox. His
price is 12/6, postage 1/- extra. If
you cannot find him in your town,
send a money order to the makers’
Australian office, Westclox, 63 Pitt
Street, Sydney. They will have
one mailed to you at once by the
nearest jeweller.

Healthy, Happy and Contented are the Babies
Fed on Albulactin with Diluted Cow’s Milk.
“ T" T affords me great pleasure to send you a testimonial as to
1 the excellent and eminently satisfactory results obtained
from the use of your valuable preparation, Albulactin.
“Our baby was suffering from a very weak digestion, and
unable to digest cow’s milk, however weakly diluted. Our doctor
recommended Albulactin, and brought us the first bottle along to
try. Within 24 hours a change was noted for the better; and
since then, a period of eight mouths, baby has never looked back,
and to-day, at 10 months’ old, weighs 24 lbs. without his clothes,
has eight teeth, and is almost walking.
“ We have recommended this valuable preparation to another
lady in this town whose baby is suffering from an ulcerated
stomach, and have also passed on to her your invaluable booklet,
‘ King Baby.’ Mr. CHAS. B. PEARSON, Featherstotre Street,
Palmerston, N., New Zealand.
Lady Hardinge (wife of
the British Minister to
Belgium) writes :—“ My
nurse used Albulactin, and
it was most successful.”
Albulactin is sold by all
Chemists, price 3/3d. and
6/6d. per bottle.
Buy a bottle to-day, for
the sooner you start using
Albulactin the better it will
be for your baby.

London New Age has a full-page carica-
ture of our George Reid —monocle, embon-
point, baldness and all. Under runs the
legend, "Sir Joseph Reid.” Is it for this
that George has become the champion dinner-
eater of the largest empire on earth?
“Brolga” : The Bulletin’s article on the
Sermon that was Preached Backwards
and the Well that was Sunk from
the Bottom reminds me that the late
Jack Annear, thrice member for Mary-
borough (Q.), once called tenders for the
“erection of a well.” After that, prior to
sending Jack to the Legislative Council,
they made him chairman of the Commission
to inquire in the operations of the Works
Department.
Sainsbury, head of the Victorian police,
was recently going to dismiss a young con-
stable for step-dancing in barracks, but was
induced to let the unfortunate young Hop off
with a fine of fl. This official habit of dis-
couraging nimbleness is a fatal defect. The
ideal policeman would be as light-footed as a
gazelle and as agile as an ape. Instead of
fines, prizes should therefore be given to
dancing policemen, and nromotion should
pursue the officer who excelled in shinning up
waterspouts. The slow, heavy constable, who
obviously never step-dances or hurries, looks
all right, but unfortunately you can’t cap-
ture a swift, modern malefactor with a
look, or even two looks.
Michael Carmichael, alleged on what look
like good grounds to be one of the famous
Six Hundred, is living at Ballarat (Vic.),
aged 86 years. He was dangerously wounded
in the charge, but was nursed back to life
by Florence Nightingale and her angels.
Subsequently he served in the Indian Mutiny
trouble at Delhi, Cawnpore and Lucknow.
After the old King of Delhi had been taken
prisoner, he got, he states, £3OO as his share
of the spoil, and a sergeant’s stripes for
saving the colonel’s life. Also he got a pen-
sion of 2s. 4d. per day and medals—the Cri-
mean, the Turkish and Indian Mutiny. . The
pension he sold on leaving for Australia in
1866, and as for the medals, he admits hav-
ing pawned them.
When Samuel Thornton (who is about to
marry in England at the age of 78) was
Bishop of Ballarat he achieved the irreverent
sobriquet of “Soapy Sam.” One tale told of
the doctor described how he and his family
were disturbed some time after midnight by
a terrific clamor at the front door. There
were two people at the door, a man and a
woman; one knocking, the other ringing.
They wanted to be married there and then.
The bishop refused the job. The couple
insisted. The bishop still declined. “Oh,
very well,” said the man, “I’m if we’ll
get married at all.” About 12 months later
the woman sued the man for the mainte-
nance of the baby. “It ain’t no fault o’
mine,” pleaded defendant, in reply to the
reproaches of the Bench. “Blame the bloom-
in’ bishop.” And the bishop did actually
come in for a good deal of blame, whether he
deserved it or not.
“Umfaan’s” valedictory address: —
Parson A. R. Edgar’s recent resignation from the
Melbourne Wesleyan City Mission denotes the painful
beginning of the end for a man who, even though
a Wowser chief, had human feelings. As Edgar lies
at the point of grievous sickness, I like to recall the
many broad-minded actions that would hardly have
found favor with most of his cult. In Swanston-
street one night Parson Edgar and I were talking
on a corner. A deadbeat with the counter-lunch
habit stamped upon his countenance approached. His
method seemed to suggest desperation, and it was
fully 10.30. “Gimme a thrum, mister,” he said to
Edgar; “I want a beer bad. ’Struth, I do.” Edgar
dredged his hand into a well-worn pocket, and took
sixpence from the frayed edges. “There, take this,
and get two pints.” The derelict took it and fled.
Edgar turned to me. “But the man was suffering,”
he said ; “I could see that.” I’m afraid not many
of the bigoted faithful who followed his pulpit re-
marks could have behaved in the same manner.
But, then, “Who am I that I should judge?” was
Edgar’s motto.
Simon Degree didn’t know all about
slavery. There’s a cocky over in Maoriland
could teach him some of the fine points.
The other day at the Feilding Court an in-
spector of truancy proceeded against a widow
with nine children, and this is what he told
the magistrate -
Of the nine children the eldest was 13, and the
others 11, 10, eight, seven, six, four, two and one year
old respectively. The woman milked 12 cows for a
farmer. The boy aged 13 milked seven, the girl
aged 12 milked seven, and the employer milked five,
making a total of 31 cows. After milking, the boy
had 18 calves to feed, the girl helping him in his
work, after which (if time allowed) they went to
school. Then the boy had 10 pigs to feed, after
which he had to clean the separator and milking
utensils. His next performance was to clean out the
cow-shed and bails. This constituted the morning’s
work, and in the afternoon it had all to be repeated.
After the work was done they had to forage for
wood, and the widow had to cut it herself. The
work started at 5 a.m., and for this labor the
widow was paid at the rate of Is. 3d. per cow per
week, on the understanding that the maximum
should not exceed 80s. per week, so that in the
winter, when there were onlv a few cows to milk,
she only earned a few shillings per week. Accord-
ing to the arrangement no food was supplied, but
the farmer allowed them a house to live in and sup-
plied them with milk.
The cocky’s generosity in letting the family
have free milk got its reward —the case was
thrown out. Which means that the generous
cocky’s cheap labor won’t be .interfered with.
From the Queensland press gallery: —
Like the rest of them; ' Bananaland Assembly has
its freaks. Land, from a constituency which hangs
on to The Edge, never' west's a starched collar or a
tie of any sort. His shirt suggests that he is
always ready to grapple with ,a hot problem. Hunter
is a good customer Of the small shop which sells
gum. He chews the cud incessantly. Murphy, the
Labor Independent and the £>arty °f one > seldom
keeps a seat in the Chamber warn. He sits all over
the House, and is, perhaps, the most popular member
in it. Bowman’s wheezy laugh is hot heard so often
as it used to be, but his genial grin is still incessant.
Not a member owes the ex-Labor leader a grudge,
though he hits the Government pretty hard occa-
sionally. Luke’s fad runs to khaki coats buttoned
up to the neck. Betting is even as to whether he
wears a shirt. Welsby and Donald Mackintosh
drowse on the benches more than any of the others.
Kirwan’s head of black frizzy hair would be envied by
any Fijian. When he rises to discuss railway matters
the mOp seems to respond to the occasion. Kessel
has an insatiable desire to annoy the Opposition, and
never tires of trotting out the fractured marriage tie
and the busted home. The Ministers are mostly
colorless limpets. When May speaks the House is
sure of relaxation. He simply wallows in mixed
metaphor. Little Larcombe will some day nod his
head off when he speaks. Bob Philp, the “father,”
devotes his time now to smoothing troubled waters.
From pace-maker he has become the affluent peace-
maker. Barrister Ryan, who leads the Opposition,
is by far the most capable Labor chief of late years.
There is liberality in his views, culture in his lan-
guage, force in his personality, crispness in his argu-
ment. He never wastes time in mere words. In
Theodore, from the ’Curry copper belt, he has a
powerful lieutenant, with Lennon, Hunter and Bow-
man, the ablest supporter? of the pyramid.

Does Accuracy Govern Your
Choice in a Rifle ?
YOUR dealer will tell you that one arm’s ability to
shoot a little better than another is sometimes a
matter of prejudice—more often a matter of
difference in cost and therefore workmanship*
Remington-UMC single shot rifles command a
slightly higher price than that paid for any other
hammer type small calibre arm. They are bought in
preference to all others by crack shots all over the world.
There is, for instance, a little more care taken in
the boring and rifling of the barrel in Remington-UMC
single shot rifles than is perhaps considered necessary
in the comparatively low cost arm.
May we send you a booklet explaining simply these and other
technical featt rjs of modern rifle construction. Your name and
address on a post-card will bring it by return post.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it ; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible anil comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them, lhey
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off theni
the strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What
a relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt
w
the ear. It fits the ori-
fice of the ear with pre-
cision and comfort. The
division that runs across
the mouth is to allow the
removal and insertion of
the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lo t
the he a r ing-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-dav. But
if you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (w<*
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without
the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are onlv
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for' Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send' them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order Form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

IN
BANANA LAND
Retiring on six months’ leave, tough old
J. B. Henderson, who has been Queensland’s
hydraulic engineer for the past 35 years.
Henderson, who is long past his 70th "mile-
stone, boasts proudly that he has never once
taken leave of absence in all his official
career of nearly two score years.
“Politicus” : The lately-referred-to Father
Wolf, of Blackall, wasn’t the only R.C. priest
who has been a mayor in Queensland. Gayn-
dah chose for its mayor some years ago
burly Father McKiernan. And Bundaberg’s
most active citizen in municipal matters is
Father Mimnagh, who could be mayor to-
morrow if he had any aspirations that way.
The Queensland Liberal family is not a
happy one. The other day the farmers of the
new Country Party, in solemn conclave, for-
swore the name “Liberal” —to the disgust
of the Courier and kindred organs. Banana-
land farmers don’t love Labor, as a rule, but
they have nous enough to see that a produce-
merchant Government is not likely to be a
good thing for the producer.
John Deane, who passed out at Towns-
ville the other day, landed at Rockhampton
when he came to Queensland from Cork in
1863. He hadn’t put in long in the hamlet
on the Fitzroy when Nash’s discovery of
Gympie attracted him north. Ravenswood
soon boomed, and then “Charters Tors,” as
it was first called. (Charters was the name
of the mining warden at Ravenswood.)
Deane joined in the scramble for the yellow
curse, owned one of the first crushing plants
in North Queensland, backed his faith in
Charters Towers with his dollars, came out
on top, and was rewarded with a seat in the
House of Lucky Speculators.
From the country where the curse roosts:
Southern Queensland is holding its breath with
both hands, and in the silence one can almost hear
the price of butter drop. The whaffor of this is
that the next few weeks will pretty well decide the
success or otherwise of O. C. Roberts’s experiments in
destroying pear by gas. Roberts claims that his
early comparative failures were due to impure materi-
als, and he says that that difficulty is now overcome.
Others are afraid that the practically dormant state
of the vegetable through the winter has made his
later efforts seem more successful than they really
are. Still, after a few weeks of the early growing
season, things look distinctly encouraging. With
summer here, the pear has now tucked up its sleeves
and is about to show this man what it really can do,
and the result is anxiously awaited. Already, after
inspecting Roberts’s work, some men, with large ex-
perience of pear, are adding to their holdings on
spec.
Many long hours have been spent this
Parliamentary session in advocating the
opening up of land by railways. It sounds
well; but already for its population Queens-
land is one of the most heavily railwayed
countries on earth, and yet settlement drags
terribly. Brisbane is growing; but in the
rural parts the only thing that grows much
is pricklv pear. Really the urgent ques-
tion is how to settle the lands already
settled. The Agricultural Department wants
vitalising. Every branch of it is starved.
The Gatton College has not as much as a
laboratory. There are not enough inspectors
to see how many of the dairy cattle are
affected by tuberculosis. The tobacco expert
has been knocked off. There is no organi-
sation worth mentioning to control the ex-
port of produce. There is practically no
irrigation. The breeds of beef cattle are
deteriorating. Cotton grows like a weed,
and will pay as well as maize, according to
the Under-Sec.’s report, yet the industry
is almost extinct. The cry is that labor is
too dear; but the real truth is that a
starved department has no organisation to
set the industry on its feet.
HONESTLY ACQUIRED.
COP (menacingly): “Here! Where’d you git that black eye?”
SUSPECTED PERSON (assuringly): “S’help me bob, a man guv it ter me roun’ th' corner."
COP (disgustedly): “Git outer this with it, then.”
Queensland Department of Public Health
asserts that Brisbane is paying £2BOO a
year for 34,000 gallons of water sold as pure
cow-juice by Tommy Milk-oh. As the total
fines and costs for the year amounted to
less than £5OO, this is a case clearly where
dishonesty is the best policy.
They go a long way to protect the in-
fant in Bananaland. A woman had re-
ceived a child in consideration of payment.
Her house was not registered as a nursing
home. The child died. The woman was
brought before the P.M. —and fined 10
shillings. Looked at on the lowest plane it
was wretched business, because the infant
had just cost the Commonwealth £5.
Outside Rockhampton there is a small
township named Gracemere, which can
claim to be the most represented hamlet
for its size in Bananaland, if not in Aus-
tralia. From almost any verandah in the
place a stone can be thrown into three
State electorates —Fitzroy, Normanby and
Keppel. But for all its representation,
Gracemere has a habit of never asking for
anything—and mostly gets it.
Just at present it is only the white man
who can’t live up North. Fifty years ago.
as a Courier reprint recalls, sheep couldn’t
live there, either. When the explorer
Landsborough was in London he met the
Royal Geographical Society, and told it that
Queensland was fine pastoral country;
whereupon learned members said it was
quite plain sheep couldn’t thrive there,
because the sheep was a woolly beast, and
wool was obviously a protection against the
cold of frigid latitudes.
“Flinderino,” from a dust-heap :
Rockhampton has not had a decent shower of rain
since June, and the resident who owns half a tank
of water has to padlock the tap by night and sleep
alongside with a double-barrelled dog fully loaded.
The State school tanks are about played out, and
the youngsters mostly carry their own drinking
water in a bottle or a billycan. There is a sort of
a service through the town, but the water is undrink-
able in its raw state, being drawn from a stagnant
lagoon. Even the lagoon is becoming tired, and
gardeners are warned off it. There are no meters to
tell tales of the extravagant gardener, but the frogs
serve instead. The inspector prowls around, and
whenever he hears an orchestra of frogs playing a
Wagner overture he rushes the premises with a
summons and subpoenas one or two of the frogs to
give evidence in the case.
“ J.P.K.” : A. J. Foster, 70 years of age,
rifle shooting the other day in Herberton,
put up a score of 97 out of a possible 105,
with regulation targets, at 300, 500 and 600
yards. Forty-five of Foster’s 70 years have
been spent in North Queensland. Straight
as an arrow, gnarled in knuckle and brow,
and full of energy, he looks good for many
more ; and this in a country where the white
man can’t etc., etc.
The appalling climate of the North, which
takes all that is best out of men and women,
continues to sap that grand old virtue of the
South —sectarian bitterness and dog-fight. A
few days back Dr. Shiel, R.C. prelate of
Rockhampton, w r andered out to the far
centre of his district, for the first time, and
found clerical representatives of opposition
camps waiting with the fatted calf in one
hand and three cheers in the other. At one
reception, addresses of welcome were led off
by the Hibernian Society and followed by
the Church of England parson, the Presby-
terian admiral and the Methodist chief of
ordinance. That’s the worst of the North.
Even the Presbyterians have developed a
tendency to become mere Christians.
The New Hen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With a strut the New Hen
Took a stroll round the pen
And addressed a few words to the Rooster at
play;
“How glorious it seems
That our yesterday’s dreams
And our fancies of yore are the facts of to-
day.
“Ah! Once on a time
We thought it sublime
To lav a big nest-ful and bring out a brood,
To cackle and hatch.
To scrape and to scratch,
And spend the day filling our chickens with
food.
“But who would think now
Of making a row
To let the world know she had managed an
egg?
Not one to my score
Can I count, and no more
Can my neighbors. (Just leave me that
maggot, I beg!)
“We smile at the nest.
Our comfort and rest
No „nickens disturb with matutinal cries;
And all I’ve to do
Is to gossip with you,
And to gaze down the future and see the
sun rise.”
The lady came down
From the house with a frown:
“No eggs and no chickens! This never will
do !
The hen that won’t lay
Is a hen that won’t pay—
And the end of that hen (come along!) is
the stew!”
So now the New Hen
Struts no more round the pen
Arraigning all roosters and rooster-made
laws ;
She is one, so it seems,
With her “yesterday’s dreams.”
She is gone, and gone, too, is her busted old
“Cause.”

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP
Brisbane, November 8, 1913
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,
Premier Denham has promised that th
Government shall give a £ for £ snhJa the
exceeding £lOOO, to the Women', pA OO '
tial College, and also £6OO per a ™S
wards its upkeep for the first fw? Um to "
Mrs. Bourne, who has worked like a TVg lB '
or a twin elephant or some other fm?
anima l , can now look for some of that
which is the alleged heritage of the wear?
On Wednesday everybody who i s
body went to Ascot to lose the pittance tZ
the Cup had spared. The effort waVen
tirely successful, judging bv the pxnwct,™’
most of our Very Best wore as theyTft
the course. The Governor and Lady
gregor were there, and succored a hZ
party with a half-time meal. la g
This afternoon, again, the voice of th.
hooky was heard cooing the odds, what time
the tote drew the women punters under it
shaded roof. The public was once L r
separated from its coin. Still the femoi
part of the show was, as a ’rife 'S
frocked which was something to g 0 n 5
Mrs. Blume looked handsomi in a coa t 2
skirt of sand-colored charmeuse, and w
w.th marvellous ostrich plumes. Mrs Boh
McCowan wore a tailored white silk
and skirt, and Mrs. Pearl Kin, da rk Z
a garden-party garment of pale green and
amber Mrs. Peter Murphy, in white chan
a daughter, and Ivo BrenaS
Wl ° ls to married early next month’
smiled from under a hat which exactly
matched the blue of her Irish eyes. M tly
The lasting topic of the week was Horse
with an exalted H. On Tuesday, after the
mostly direful news of Posinatus’s victory
was whizzed over the wires, one of the
florists’ shops hung forth an outward and
visible sign of the mourning within A
wreath, tied with black ribbon, was’ dedi-
cated to Beragoon. “In memory of a dead
cert.” Sympathetic friends gathered and
silently exchanged handgrips with the be-
reaved flower vendor.
The National Council of IVimmen met
yesterday for the last time this year. It is
probable that Mrs. Kingsbury will journey
to Rome early next March to represent the
Queensland Council at the Quinquennial
Congress. Mrs. Smythe, at present in Lon-
don. will be the other Queenslander.
Mrs. C. E. Bright, wife of the Deputy
t ostmaster-General in Melbourne, and
daughter of our Colonel Foxton, died in
Melbourne yesterday. She was quite
young, somewhere in the early thirties, and
leaves two little Australians motherless.
Before her marriage, which took her away
from her home city, she was a very popular
member of the younger set. and seems to
have been equally well liked in the South-
ern ydlage. Her mother has been staying
in Melbourne for some weeks, and the
Colonel went down on Sunday,
Next week Mr. and Mrs. Cockburn, with
daughter Betty of the alluring contralto
voice, leave by the Osterley for Egypt. Mr.
Cockburn is interested in builders and their
works, and naturally wants to cast a criti-
cal eye over Pharaoh’s pyramids. The
family will trip round the Nile for some
weeks, and then on to England.
Mrs. T. G. Rabbets, wife of T. G.
Rabbets, of the Courier literary staff, died
very suddenly on Tuesday morning. She
hadn’t been well for some time, but had
seemed better lately, and nobody expected
the unwelcome Reaper so soon. The de-
ceased lady was intensely musical and a
great lover of children—two virtues worth
encouragement.
Mr. Harry Musgrove happened in this
week to make arrangements for the Julius
Ivnight season. It isn’t often that this
place is dazed with the appearance of a
decent show in November, and as soon as
the inhabitants recover Henry will be
handed the fatted bottle or the three-star
calf or something else spiritual.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Gladstone, which possesses one of the best
harbors in Australia, is to have a long-
sought-after Harbor Board. But it wakes
up late. It should have had the railway that
has been built west from Rockhampton; but
Rockhampton, though less deserving, was
more alert, and the plum went down its
gullet.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Naoj A grain of comment in a bushel of
words. Do some winnowing and try again... .Phari-
see (and others —many others) : We can’t undertake
to return the MS. of unaccepted paragraphs.... Free
and accepted: Cocks has had only one term as Mayor
of Sydney. If there’s waste through want of organi-
sation in the City Council s service, and Cocks’s
scheme of re-organisation is a reasonable one —as it
seems to be—it would be a fair thing to give him a
chance to carry it into effect. It takes a man pretty
well a year to get the hang of things in a big indus-
trial and administrative concern like the City Coun-
cil of Sydney, and to chop him off at the end of the
year looks a good deal like wasting valuable experi-
ence... .C.L.M.: Can’t quote in general terms ; but
if you mention the specific drawing you’ve got your
eye on, the business department will tell you the
price.... D. Tremens: According to the official re-
turns, one N.S.W. smallpox patient has died of the
disease; but after the certificate was lodged it was
explained that there were complications, and that
the smallpox was, as it were, merely the last kick
into the grave.... Salt: Form unsuitable; it runs
away with too much space. . . . Fitz: Typed so faintly
that we had to pay for re-filming the sub-editor’s
best pair of eyes. .. .Rabbo: Will you take the Book
in your right hand and swear it is original 1... . Geo.
S. : Well written, but interest hardly general enough.
... . P. C. Ayr: Commissions are no longer purchas-
able in the British army. The system was abolished
by Lord Cardwell in 1871....P.A. (Longreach, Q.) :
That page is the advertiser’s. Returning verses. Send
them direct, if you like, but we are afraid they are
not likely to hit his fancy... .Nalj: Very lumpy
parody. .. .W.J.C.: Rather dull verse, and the form
isn’t attractive. .. .A.8.H.: Brief burst of riverside
song received. Cheerful enough, but somewhat out
of tune....E.C. (S.A.) : Feeble humor and the ex-
perimental verse-form is very monotonous... .J.E.L.:
Very labored verse. You hammer in your rhymes at
the proper places, and that’s about all. .. . J.F.H.
(W.A.) : Guess you’re a better hand with the pick.
....Boronia: Yours is the third Western poem to go
down to-day with a thud... .Inver G.: Both fail. .. .
R.W.J.: Heavyweight humor. .. .R.M.V. (W.A.) : No
use to us. Try another paper. . . .Donald D. (S.A.) :Un-
suitable. .. .Y.L.: The line that decided its fate —-
“Eyes worth to be praised in a glee.” There are
others, but that is the worst. .. .O’P. (Tas.) : No. .. .
W.K.F.: A faint echo of Rudyard K....M.T.: Too
young and green.... Les H.: Better put that romance
away in a cellar for 15 years or so and let it
mature.... Dead Marine: Never said that the rail-
way steel cargo wasn’t consigned to Brisbane. What
The B. did say was that, since the vessel passed
Cairns, and the rails were wanted at Cairns, that
cargo should have been consigned to Cairns. .. .
Squidge: As Holman says, Wade may be afraid to
produce a decent policy because he knows his sup-
porters wouldn’t stand it That’s where Holman has
the advantage. His followers will apparently stand
anything. . . .E.C.H. (London) : Find out the date of
publication, and we’ll hunt it up. .. .G.V.W. (M.L.) :
Send address. .. .Red Cross: Don’t know the White
Cross League, and its only address, apparently, is a
Sydney post-office box, which is vague and unsatis-
factory. If anybody else knows more about the
league, The B. will be glad of it. It may be a
very good league, in which case this paper wants to
throw a bouquet at it. .. .L. Withall: Thanks for the
Suffragette articles; but they are worthless. The
Pankhurst idea of eliminating venereal disease by
persuading mankind .to become virtuous, may be
ethically beautiful, but it is outside the bounds of
practical politics. .. .Jan: The Bulletin cannot
undertake to acknowledge pars, in this or any other
column. If it set out why every unaccepted par.
wasn’t accepted, there wouldn’t be room to accept
anything. .. .Solfa: Please give your Muse a voice
lozenge.
“Earnest Feeder” recalls some meals
One who calls himself an “Australio-Englishman”
has an article in the London Westminster Gazette
(22/9/’l3) on the towns and cities of the Common-
wealth. Some of his comments are acute enough,
but many show the Briton’s immemorial superficiality
in the matter of Australian information. For ex-
ample:—“in Sydney the best restaurant is on the
top floor of a general store, and is only open one
night a week!” The best restaurant in Sydney—
meaning the one at which the gourmet will get the
highest class of a la carte dinner, provided he is
prepared to pay the price—is still, in all likelihood,
that establishment whose name for years was men-
tioned in the same breath by travelled folks with
the Poodle Dog at San Francisco, the Cafe de la
Paix in Paris, and other well-known bourgeois
resorts. If this is not Sydney’s best restaurant there
are two big hotels, at least, which have a valid
claim to the stakes. Go to the head waiter of one
of them, tell him as man to man that the cost is
no object, and he will see to it that the chef turns
out such a meal as the Savoy or the Carlton would
find it hard to better. The proprietress of . the
other, if similarly approached, would be willing
and able to do likewise. Wandering Englishmen,
“Anglo-Australians” and the like get a totally
wrong idea of the way the big cities of
the Commonwealth feed, by reason of the
fact that in their frenzied rush through this
continent, they only desist from the task of writing
its history to snatch an occasional table d’hote
meal. Table d’hote meals are bad everywhere, as all
food that is cooked in bulk must be. They are
rather worse in Sydney and Melbourne than they
are in London or Paris. But then, on the other
hand, they are much cheaper. In fact, the Austra-
lian public’s stark insistence on cheap table d’hote
food, counled with the facts (1) that the middle-
man is tirelessly bumping up the price of the vic-
tuals, (2) that the Wages Boards have given the
waiters and waitresses living wages, and (3) that
the prevalence of the Wowser debars most of the
eating-houses from getting wine and spirit licenses,
are responsible between them for that most frequent
of tragedies, the ruined mfiitre d'hotel. The food
position, as regards both Sydney and Melbourne, may
best be stated this wav: There are scores of res-
taurants, ranging in situation from the roofs or
top-storeys of stores, to the basements of flats, where
the food supplied is mere sustenance. As against
this there are a few places in each city where the
expert judge of a good dinner can get exactly what
he is accustomed to. But the type of person who
writes most about Australia in the overseas papers is,
of course, one of the last to discover the whereabouts
of these gastronomic paradises.
From an old Parliamentarian in London:
Like Pinero’s, the recent plays of Henry Arthur
Jones have been disappointing failures for the most
part, but he has scored an unmistakable hit with
“Mary Goes First” at the London Playhouse. It is
a first-rate dramatic exposure of the sale of titles to
wealthy social “climbers” in return for their big
donations to party campaign funds, and no more
slashing bit of stage-work has been done for years.
Both parties, Liberals and Tories, are equally tarred
with this brush. It has long been an open secret that
most peerages, baronetcies and knighthoods ore
obtained in this way ; yet smug Britishers hypocriti-
cally hold up their hands at the mere mention of
Tammany Hall. So far as the plot is concerned,
Jones’s new comedy is very slight—just a contest for
social precedence between a couple of ambitious
dames in a country town. The husband of one suc-
ceeds in getting himself made a knight, whereupon
the other, Mary, sets to work to get hers made a
baronet, and does it; so she “goes first.” It is in the
pungent dialogue that Jones scores. By the way, he
gives as a motto or text for his play this quota-
tion from a book on titles written by one Fettle-
worth, and published in 1764: “The claim to prece-
dency is the claim of those who have no other, and
the honors and dignities adjudged by the State serve
but to varnish strategems and pretences whereby they
were obtained.” Thus, bad as conditions are, our
old nobility mostly arrived at their nobleness by
paths in which Virtue wasn’t a more conspicuous
finger-post than it is to-day.

remedies and advice to cure her, for over
three months, but without any sign of the
sores going away. One day I saw the Cuti-
cura Remedies advertised, and reading of a
cure obtained through using Cuticura, I
sent for a sample of Cuticura Ointment,
which I applied as directed. When the
sample was finished I purchased the Cuti-
cura Remedies, and after about a fortnight
you could see that she was much better. I
continued using the Cuticura Remedies and
in three months’ time the trouble had quite
left hor, and although she is now just over
four years, no signs of the trouble have ever
returned.” (Signed) Mrs. J. Dye, June,
1012.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment do so much
for poor complexions, red, rough hands, and
dry, thin and falling hair, and cost so little,
that it is almost criminal not to use them.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment are
sold throughout the world. Liberal sample
of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.
Dr. B. ALLEN’S iu.s.ao
Mexican WALNUT STAIN
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,
mercury, silver, sulphur, etc., and is equally suitable
for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or Moustache.

New Preparation
Causes Big Scare Among Hair Specialists.
My True Hair Grower has a most wonder-
ful effect upon the hair glands and tissues
of the scalp. It is the only remedy for the
hair ever discovered that is similar to the
natural hair foods or liquids of the scalp.
It penetrates the pores quickly, and the
hair soon shows the effects of its wonder-
fully exhilarating and life-producing quali-
ties.
Besides being a True Hair Grower, my
preparation quickly removes DANDRUFF,
and stops FALLING HAIR and ITCHING.
It is known the world over, and I have in
my consulting-rooms upwards of 3000 grate-
ful letters from men and women who have
derived so much benefit from the use of my
True Hair Grower as to compel them to
write and thank me.

“Billy” Lane, leader of the communistic party
that tried to form a new Australia in Paraguay 20
years ago, has been appointed editor of the Conser-
vative Auckland (M.L.) Herald. Lane, after giving
“New Australia” best, returned to journalism in
these parts, and for some years has been pushing his
polished pen in the Auckland paper of which he now
takes command.
“Miss Lucy,” in the S. M. Herald
(1/1 l/’IS), alludes to the appointment of Mr. O’Brien
as Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and mentions that he
is one of a very few who have reached such an
exalted position after having started life as a re-
porter. There are, however, several instances in Aus-
tralia of reporters and journalists having reached
high judicial positions. James Martin, of the Atlas
newspaper, became Chief Justice of N.S.W. ; George
Higinbotham, once a reporter on the Morning
Chronicle, was Chief Justice of Victoria; R. D.
Hanson, a reporter on the London press, Chief Justice
of South Australia; and James Dowling, a reporter
for the newspapers in the House of Lords, was the
second Chief Justice of N. S. Wales. Richard Win-
deyer, reporter for the Morning Chronicle, Times,
etc., if not raised to the Bench, distinguished him-
self as a barrister and Parliamentarian. Nearer our
own time, David Gilbert Ferguson, N. S. Wales
Supreme Court, was a journalist; so was “Dick”
O’Connor, one of the first members of the High
Court. And the list could be easily extended.

“A.L.8.”: The first Queensland pressman to make
an air-flight was R. Evans, of Brisbane Daily Stan-
dard. He accompanied the reckless A. W. Jones
at Ascot recently. E. G. Simkins, of the Courier,
and Ellis, of the Telegraph, followed Evans. Pre-
sently, 1 suppose, any pressman will be liable to find
himself down in the duty book for a hundred-mile fly
for the first edition, but just at present we hang
round the office to get the man’s job in case he
shouldn’t come back in a sufficiently whole state to
resume duty.
“Locust” _ (from London) : Australian novelist
Albert Dorrington, who started spilling ink in The
Bulletin, has the knack of purveying for the
greediest market, and can adjust his facile pen to
the latest novelistic fashions, as a modiste can trim
“confections.” He has just turned out a snow and
ice story, Jack London having made snow and ice
fashionable lately. In this Dorrington plays with
wolf packs and moose herds, elk, caribou meat, Sioux
Injuns, spruce and pine, jamming log-rafts, “the
carnivorous odor from wolves, w etc. The hero is a
young Amurrikan (these stories sell readily in
Amurrika, and are read by the youths in the big
department stores and the young ladies who sell
socks' and corsets).' Into all this Dorrington—-
“Alba Dorion” of old —-drags a motor-car, with
which the hero saves his wife and cheeyild from
the pack of wolves, driving through them and draft-
ing them into sections, just as Bill from Thargo-
mindah would have done on horseback. The yarn
ends with the mournful note of the narked wolf-
pack, followed by the loud curracking of rifles, and
a final purrayer of the mother over her cheeyild.
It’s a grief to Dorrington that the pest-importers
who gave us the rabbit, the tick, the sparrow and
the Scotch thistle didn’t introduce elk, wolves,
Sioux Injuns afid moose. You can’t, he complains,
write a thriller about the number of sheep to the
acre.

Adelaide Labor Herald, by its manager, E. J.
Thomas, has been before the S. Aus. Supreme Court
for “contempt.” A divorce Case is pending against
a popular Adelaide lawyer, and the Herald had
said: “It is freely stated that the lady in the case
has offered to confess, conditionally on another co-re.
being left out of the proceedings.” No names were
mentioned, but the reference was clear, and the
paper’s counsel could only call it “an item of news
in the ordinary course of business,” deny that there
was any intention to injure the lady, and suggest
that it was a case of libel, if anything—not con-
tempt. The Court was in a good humor, and said
a fine of £ 5 would meet the case; but it gave costs
against the Herald, “as between solicitor and
client,” which is a particularly deadly brand.

The suffragettes’ latest production is The Monthly
Bulletin of Women’s Suffrage in Britain. Says the
editress: “We are constantly hearing wails [the
editress’s typiste made it “heaving males,” but it
was altered] from women voters in Australia that
they hear so little of the Movement at home.” Hence
the Monthly Bulletin. The women voters in Aus-
tralia who don’t hear enough of the Movement at
’ome may note, incidentally, that the suffragettes’
telegraphic address is “Voiceless, London.” The
shrieky sisterhood has a sense of humor, evidently.

Died lately at Windsor (N.S.W.) Charles Moss
Davies, once a well-known pressman, aged 59 years.
His father was G. L. A. Davies, who, besides found-
ing the Australian newspaper in Windsor, estab-
lished the Country Press Association, now a flourish-
ing institution. The son, just dead, succeeded
his father in the Australian, and worked it until it
closed down about 15 years ago.

“Hibernian”: With the death of Patrick Ford,
which occurred in New York a month back, goes one
of British Toryism’s most popular arguments against
Irish Home Rule. The anti-Nationalist press got
some of its finest effects by quoting Ford, and then
mentioning that the criminal disloyalist was the
bosom friend of John Redmond and Devlin. I trav-
elled in the same railway carriage with him between
New York and Chicago about 10 years ago, but only
learned afterwards who he was. I remember him as
a small, thin man, with a very broad head, large,
glowing eyes, and the mildest possible manner. The
Boer war was raging at the time, and no doubt
because he mistook me for an Englishman, his com-
ments on the efforts of the invaders were studiously
civil —a contrast to the remarks of the average Yank
of the period. In print he was vastly different.
The columns of the Irish World, which he owned
and edited in New York, fairly sizzled with detesta-
tion of England. For years he provided the anti-
English extremists of all nations with their best
argumentative weapons, and he was the first to lay
down the principle that Home Rule would only be
achieved by force. In a sense he was right. Vio-
lence was the first stage; obstruction in the Com-
mons the next; party pressure the third; and the
end, which looks like being accomplished in 1914,
would probably never have been reached without all
three. It is this lesson which the militant suffra-
gists have taken to heart. The London papers com-
pare him with Rochefort of I’lntransigeant. Their
journalistic methods were alike, but whereas the
Frenchman was a reckless fire-eater, chronic duellist
and ardent platform speaker, the other was physically
timid and a constitutional hater of the limeiight.
W. J. Walton, who has hopes of being the next
M.L.A. for Durham (N.S.W.), began a busy life at
12 years old, when he started selling papers to
help along his widowed mother and her eight chil-
dren. From that he just drifted into a printing
office, got himself apprenticed, and then worked on
the Parramatta Independent (owned at the time
by John Nobbs, M.L.A. for Granville). Next, at
Raymond Terrace, he joined the Gloucester Gazette,
now the property of the sitting member for Durham.
This paper was started by a brother of T. Courtney,
of the Daily Telegraph. Eighteen months
later he was on the Daily Telegraph, and
stayed there for years; after which, with
a few pounds in his pocket, he bought the
Narrabri Age, and battled away through libel actions
and other excitements till he had got together one
of the best plants and most profitable businesses in
the Nor’-West. But he had made things pretty
strenuous, and was glad enough to consider his bank
balance and pull out a year ago.

London has got a new daily paper, the Jewish
Times. It is printed in Yiddish ; and as there are
about half a million Yids around Whitechapel, the
experiment ought to have a fair chance. The price is
a ha’penny, for four pages of seven columns each,
and the editor hopes to “improve the cultural and'
intellectual standard of the Jewish masses and better
their economical situation.” As for profit, he has no
hopes. Isaac never has. He makes his fortune out
of his lotheth.

SIMPLE ACCIDENT CAUSES
RUNNING ULCERS
Whole Leg a Swollen Mass of Inflammation —Bedridden for Months
Together. Every Description of Treatment Completely Fails.
Zam-Buk’s Remarkable Triumph of Skin-growing
and Disease-dispelling.
As a triumph of skin-healing and disease-
dispelling, the victory by Zam-Buk in the case
of Mrs. 8. Clifford, of 67 Gold Street, Collingwood,
Melbourne, is probably without parallel. This
lady says:—“While going upstairs I slipped
and scraped the skin off one of my legs. I
neglected to give the wound any special
attention, and simply bound it up.
thinking it would be all right; but in-
stead of getting better the leg gradu-
ally grew worse, and at the end of three
months it had developed alarming
symptoms. The wound discharged and
presented the appearance of a running
ulcer, the pain being almost unbear-
able. I thought blood-poisoning had
set in.
“The climax came one night, when
my leg got so bad and presented such
serious indications, that I made up my
mind to go into the hospital the next
morning. I did so, and there I was a
patient, undergoing continuous treat-
ment, for eighteen months. The doctors
scraped the bone in the leg, and the
agony afterwards was indescribable.
“In the hospital the doctors applied

her gratitude to Zam-Buk.
the fearful swelling; but their efforts were powerless to do me any good. At last my
leg got so bad that I had to become a resident in the hospital, where the doctors
applied hot fomentations to the wound every hour incessantly for two days.
“Then the doctors resolved to graft some skin over the wound. They did so, but
the ‘graft’ remained on only two or three days, when it came away and a fresh wound
broke out and formed an outlet near the ankle-bone, increasing tenfold my already
overflowing cup of misery.
“I was an inmate of the hospital for a month. I then left that institution for
home, and thankful I was to do so. My mother happened to be talking to a neighbor
about me one day. and telling her how I was suffering. She immediately asked mother
if I had tried Zam-Buk. She strongly advised mother to get a supply, and let me try
it on my leg.
“So mother, fortunately, followed her advice, and procured a pot of Zam-Buk. I
applied a dressing, and under the influence of Zam-Buk the pain ceased almost im-
mediately, the inflammation and swelling subsided, and I could actually feel the
soothing powers of Zam-Buk at work. I continued with the treatment of Zam-Buk,
and applied a dressing every two or three hours, each application bringing additional
relief. After a week of this treatment the wound on the ankle had healed completely.
“It was a harder fight with the larger wound, however, but I knew that my case
was a bad one, and I kept on and persevered with Zam-Buk. The big ulcerated hole
began to contract, the bottom of the wound looked healthier in every way, and at the
end of six weeks Zam-Buk had completed its miraculous work, and the wound was
healed right up wdth clean, new, healthy skin.”

np HE mother gazed with loving pride
I On her two daughters at her side.
One was as fair as fair could be, ■
The name of her was Emily.
The other was a pale brunette,
The name of her. was Margaret.
“Now, daughters mine, confess to me
What like your Fairy Princes be.”
“My Fairy Prince,” said Margaret,
“Shall be as good as I can get.
“He shall be strong, he shall be true,
lie shall have eyes of clearest blue.
“He shall be honest as the sun,
And owe no debts to anyone.
“He shall not drink, or say words rude,
But be respectable and good,
“And rich —as Princes ought to be —
And he shall think the world of me.”
Said Emily, with golden hair —
“My Prince shall have a gallant air,
“To me in dreams he does anpear
Just like a Spanish cavalier,
“And, in the moonlight pale, we dance
Upon the shores of old Romance.
“His eyes are like two starry wells:
In them, he says, my image dwells.
“He’s poor, but he will work for me
And we shall rich and hapny be —
“But, if I love him not, he can,
And must, become a Wicked Man.
“The dreadful deeds that he will do,
O, mother dear, would frighten you.
“He says, in accents passionate,
That in my hands I hold his fate,
“And that my noble womanhood
Will lift him up and make him good.
“But, mother mine,” said Emily,
“I think a Poet he must be.”
* * * *
The mother softly sighed, and smiled,
And said to Margaret: “My child,
“Your Prince, I fear, is far too good
To be as loving as he should.
“He’ll be your slave till you’re his wife —
And then your Master all your life.
“Your little airs and vanities
No longer will his Highness please.
“Your gaiety, and love of dress,
Will seem to him like wantonness.
“One God in Heaven there shall be,
And one on earth —and that is he!
“So you shall be a couple good—
Husband of stone, and wife of wood.”
* * * *
The mother said to Emily:
“Your Fairy Prince amuses me.
“I doubt not he is brave and bold —
I think I’ve met his sort of old,
“With mouth of honey, heart of fire—
He’ll dress you all in silk attire,
“And gratify your slightest whim,
If you will only marry him.
“Your future pathway—to the Moon —
Shall be with golden roses strewn.
“And, when the coin is extra scarce,
He’ll sing your charms in charming verse,
“But much I fear, my Emily,
Your gold like rainbow gold will be.”.. .
The father then came lightly in,
And kissed the mother’s mouth and chin :
Called her “darling,” called her “dear” —
And whispered softly in her ear.
He looked so fine, and fresh, and prim,
His daughters two were proud of him.
He took the mother then aside,
And she came back and si filed with pride.
She said : “My dears, it might be worse —
I kept a --nund out of my purse.
“But choose your Princes as you can —-
I’m married to the Wicked Man.”

The Shattering of an Illusion.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[F to frighten her a fool shouted
“Snake!” Angelina suffered a series of
sensations. Her heart stopped beat-
ting ; something tightened in her head ; her
face grew icy cold, and the blood surged
into her throat —-or seemed to. Later, to
her annoyance, she sometimes found that
her nnderlip was swollen. And this was the
girl Edwin had married and established in a
slab humpy. True, she had never seen a
living snake anywhere near her tiny home ;
still she always expected to. A mouse search-
ing for paste under the sagging wall-paper
sent her trembling to the garden to await
Edwin’s return, and a tarantula emerging
on his nightly rounds caused her to cower
down, afraid to move or speak, her body
tense and the bed-clothes smothering her.
But she would gaze on a dead snake for
hours, poking it with a stick, turning its
head this way and that, and examining its
markings closely. If you wanted to give
Angelina a thrilling time, you only had to
drop, somewhere near her dwelling, a newly-
hilled snake. She never crossed the pad-
docks without expecting to meet a savage
reptile of immense size, and always she had
visions of a tiger snake with sickeningly
flattened head, chasing and biting her. Ed
w in, the venturesome, was always meeting
snakes, and nightly told of horrific encoun-
ters, in which he was ever the victor. Like
Angelina, Edwin was city bred. It is pos-
sible that this had something to do with the
breadth, height and general enormity of
mS ( snakes.
.“Jumped on its head?” Angelina once
cried incredulously. “O darling, how
could you?”
“Well, it was just ready to strike,” ex-
plained Edwin.
“But why didn’t you run away?" Angelina
asked in amazement.
“Run away!” derided Edwin. “Let a
snake escape me!” he added amusedly. “Silly
little girl.’’
“Yes, but you ought to think of —of
others,” whimpered Angelina, hurt and
tremulous. This of course was Edwin’s
moment.
“Why didn’t you bring it home?” she
murmured when sufficiently comforted.
“Too big, darling. Biggest snake I ever
saw.”
It was a Sunday afternoon in midsummer.
Smoke from distant bush fires hung mistily
about the mountains. The air was still and
muggy. Angelina had settled herself in a
vine-sheltered corner with an unread maga-
zine on her knee. Edwin, handling his gun
in the doorwav. said it seemed a pity to
stop in. It was just the day for snakes,
and over behind the Peak the wood-duck
would be sure to seek water. Wood-duck!
Angelina hadn’t seen a wood-duck for quite
a while.
“Do you think there will be snakes?” she
asked presently.
“Sure to,” asserted Edwin, running the
cleaner through his gun. (It might be men-
tioned that a snake in the vicinity was
somewhat exceptional, and Edwin knew it.)
“Then why go?” Angelina’s expressive
eyebrows inquired.
“I like to kill the brutes,” Edwin con-
tinued indifferently.
“Might the wood-ducks have a nest
there?” Angelina asked wistfully.
“Perhaps. I came on 11 little chaps once
with their tails sticking out of the reeds
and their heads hidden.”
Angelina went inside and got her panama.
Edwin smiled.
They climbed the stony ridge side by side,
the dogs rushing on ahead, sniffing eagerly
at every log. A' hare, darting from its cool
resting place, caused Angelina to clutch
frantically at Edwin’s arm, and regardless
of the flies she raised her veil that she might
see dangerous animals ahead.
“What’s up?” asked Edwin, smiling down
at her teasingly.
“Snakes,” murmured Angelina nervously.
“Silly one,” laughed Edwin, as his arm
slipped round her protectingly. “Need
never be frightened with me.”
They crossed the summit and descended
to a reed-covered marsh, with here and
there a still, deep pool.
“This looks a terribly snaky place, dear-
est,” trembled Angelina, pausing to gaze
around.
“All the better,” laughed Edwin torment-
ingly. “We’ll have some sport, perhaps.”
Angelina tilted an offended chin.
“Now what would you do if you saw one
just there?” she asked quizzically, pointing
a slim finger.
Edwin shrugged his shoulders. “Kill it,
of course.”
“Yes, but how?”
“Get a stick and hit it,” yawned Edwin
boredly.
“But suppose it came at you before you
could get a stick?”
“Eh? Oh —er —catch it by the tail and
sling it in the air. Grab it behind the
head,” Edwin finished, with marked indif-
ference.
Angelina stared at him with big eyes,
horror writ large on her small, tanned face.
“Edwin,” she commanded fiercely, “pro-
mise me now, here, this very second, that
you will never, never catch a snake by the
head or tail. Why, if anything happened
to you”—— Her lips trembled.
Distinctly another moment had arrived
for Edwin, and later on Angelina extracted
a promise, given however rather reluctantly.
From a hidden pool two wood-ducks, call-
ing unmusically, rose skyward. Edwin,
snatching at his gun, moved on, the better
to watch their flight, but a piercing scream
from his emotional Angelina caused him to
turn back impatiently. The blood had
scuttled from her face. She stood petrified,
one arm extended, and a rigid finger point-
ing to a spot a yard from Edwin’s boot,
where a lead-colored snake of sensational
length watched him covertly. At that in-
stant the reptile moved and attracted his at-
tention. His gun dropped from his hand,
and with a cry of horror he leaped back-
wards.
“Kill it — hill it,” shrieked Angelina, her
speech restored.
But Edwin only shrank into further re-
tirement.
“Aren’t you going to hill it?” shouted
Angelina, too excited to know how sur-
prised she was.
“Of course I am.” snapped Edwin, pick-
ing up a chunk of crumbling wood and cast
ing it blindly in the vicinity of the five-
footer. The snake glided round a tree and
paused, with head upraised, its tongue dart-
ing in and out.
“You’ll lose it,” called Angelina angrily.
“Why don’t you get a stick?”
“Well, w'atch it till I do,” answered
Edwin, fading into the scrub, quite ignoring
the fact that sticks lay all round him.
“Oh, it’s going,” shrieked Angelina, as the
snake sought safety in some brushwood. “I
knew you’d lose it.”
“Is it gone?” shouted Edwin in the scrub,
where he still searched for a suitable stick.
“Gone! I should think it teas gone,”
rapped Angelina back to him in disgusted
tones. .
Edwin came out. That s a pity, he
said vexedly.
Angelina, who had armed herself with a
murderous stick, did not answer, but her
excitement was so intense that she ap-
proached the snake’s hiding place, poking
it warily. The reptile emergeu on Edwin’s
side, again causing him to cry out in terror.
With astonishing rapidity and glinting eyes
it slid across the open, and yelling wildly,
Angelina flew after it, bringing the stick
down with splendid effect just as it reached
a rabbit-burrow.
After that she moved to a safe distance
and looked round for Edwin, whose shouts
faintly reached her.
On the way home she was unusually
silent. Edwin talked a lot. As the humpy
came in sight she turned to him.
“Why didn’t you kill it?” she asked, more
in sorrow than in anger.
“Well, hang it, wasn’t I going to,”
snapped Edwin savagely, “only you’re
always in such a dashed hurry—never saw
a more impulsive girl in my life.”
Angelina stared steadily in the direction
of the setting sun.
She hummed a little tune but said never a
word.

Port Pirie,
April 19th, 1913.
Some weeks ago I must have caught a chill, and thereafter I suffered agonies from
backache. A friend suggested that I should try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and this I did.
I am now about to state a simple fad, and that is that one bottle of these Pills completely cured
me. This testimonial is entirely unsolicited, and I send it in the hope that it may benefit humanity,
and for no other reason whatever. “The proof of the pudding is in the .eating,’’ and you may
be sure that I am grateful, inasmuch that I am now able to continue my nightly scientific lectures
in ease and comfort.
You can publish this as you think fit.
Yours sincerely,
(Sgd.) CLEMENT L. WRAGGE, F.R.G.S.,

The New Money Disease.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the Boss believed in anything
he fought for it like seven devils,
with all their claws, teeth and
tails. He was a staunch supporter of the
Commonwealth Ten Shilling Note, and, to
boost it up, he paid all the office accounts,
his private bills, his employees’ w T ages, and
anything else he could in “Fisher’s Flim-
sies.” When he scattered the pocket-money
around among the family, each son and
daughter below a certain age received one
10s. note. Those above it received two. or
more. The family voted the Ten Shilling
Note an inspiration. The Boss was pleased.
He had created a sentimental value for the
note.
I, too, was an ardent supporter of the
notes —but I’m not so sure about it now. They
got me into a serious difficulty, from which
I was saved only—but I’d better tell the
whole story.
I was just leaving for a slightly earlier
lunch than usual, when the Boss discovered
that he wanted some notes. He wrote out
a cheque for £4O, and requested me to push
the notes along by buying 80 of them. I
cashed the cheque at his bank, and then went
on to the Commonwealth Bank to get paper
for the gold.
Just as I was hurrying to my favorite
restaurant, terrified that I might lose my pet
waitress, I crashed heavily into someone
coming round the corner. He wont down
heavily, and I reeled back and collided with
two ancient maiden ladies, who broke into
shrill screams of feminine and . impotent
anger, denouncing me as “a brute.” A small
crowd gathered in short order, through the
middle of which struggled the man I had
collided with. We gazed on each other for
the fraction of a second. Then the corners
of my mouth broke down, and he emitted
a gurgle of pleasure.
It was the Great Entrepreneur.
“Well, well.” he said as he shook my out-
stretched paw, “I though I had bumped into
an elephant. Say, let’s go and have some
lunch. There’s a new place down here we’ll
try. Come along.”
We -went.
It was a nice dining-room, and they served
a charming meal, which the G.E. voted as
being good enough for the wife of the Gover-
nor-General. The G.E. was distinctly
pleased. So pleased that he turned on a
second bottle of champagne, and before I knew
half an hour had passed I was horrified to
hear 3 p.m. boom out. The G.E. was
horrified, too. He had an appointment at
2.30, and the fact that he had missed it
seemed to upset him. He hurriedly called
for the bill, and began to feel in his pockets.
After searching them all he cleaned up for
half a crown, which he gave the waiter.
“Gosh, have you any money about you—
I’m ‘fly-blown,’ and they don’t know me here
from a crow.”
“Well, I’ve only about five bob of my own,
but I’ve £4O of the boss’s.”
“Well, that’s all right, old fellow. Settle
the account, and I’ll get you a cheque at the
office.”
“All right; take what you want.”
And I held out a bunch of 10s. notes, from
which he grabbed four; paid the bill, and led
the way to the street. We walked together
to the corner of King-street, and there he
lifted his hat to a young and elegant damosel
in a motor-car. The car slowed down and
swung into the pavement. He turned, and,
holding out his hand, said hurriedly:—
“Well, so-long, old fellow. I’m glad to
have met you again. Say, you must look
me up again, and we’ll have a snack and a
chin together for the sake of old times.”
And he grabbed my hand and shook it
waiunly as the motor-car came to a dead
stop at the kerb. But as he turned away I
exclaimed :
“Just one moment. I must go down to
the office with you—l want some money
from you.”
“Wha-at?” he screamed, turning on me
with a scared, dazed look in Ms eyes. “You
want what?”
“Money,” I said earnestly. Then I
stopped. For suddenly, with a shrill scream,
the Great Entrepreneur threw up his arms,
spun round and went down on the pavement
with an awful crash.
The lady in the motor-car bounded out
and screamed loudly. Mr. John Hop elbowed
his way through the gathering crowd and
demanded of me :
“Phwat sthruck th’ mahn?”
We lifted him into the car and drove at
top speed to the nearest doctor’s. _ There, as
he was still insensible, we lifted him out and
carried him into the surgery. The doctor
examined him carefully, and then looked at
his arm, and found what he had expected,
the signs of a recent vaccination.
“That adjective lymph again,” he mut-
tered.
“Will he live, doctor?” almost screamed
the elegant confection of the motor-car, lay-
ing her hands on the lapels of the doctor’s
vest, and gazing earnestly into the medico’s
eyes.
“Live, of course he will. He’s got the new
disease which is said to be due to some
foreign and unknown germ in this wretched
lymph they’re importing from the ends of the
earth. It affects the heart and spine, and
when the subject is asked for money while
under its influence, he faints, or collapses
outright. If they don’t fall dead, they in-
variably recover. But in a few severe cases
they have been known to drop dead when
asked for money.”
They took the G.E. aw T ay in the car, and I
went down and saw his secretary, a bald-
headed man, with the chin of a railway
engine. He was sympathetic; he quite
believed my story; but the rules of the office
were inexorable. He regretted he had no
money in his own clothes.
“Well, what the Devil am I to do?” I in-
quired. disgustedly.
“I dunno,” said the secretary; Then he
suddenly exclaimed: “I’ll tell you what I
would do if I were you. I’d catch the same
disease.”
I hurled myself out of the office - and
walked reluctantly towards my own place.
What to say to the Boss I did not know.
It was a piece of flagrant impudence to loan
his money to even this bloated capitalist;
but my infernal affability had always been a
millstone round my neck. The nearer I got
to the Boss’s office the worse I felt, and to
keep upright I had to stop three times and
stay myself with whisky and soda. But
in spite of the staying I almost dropped when
the brass door-plate smote me in the eye. I
knew 1 should faint outright when I met the
eye of the Boss.
I walked in and sat down at my desk.
Fortunately he was out, and when he re-
turned I was hard at work, and he dived
into the heap of papers on his desk, and tore
into his work as though he had only another
hour to live. , , . ,
I had been working for the best part of
an hour when he suddenly swung his swivel
chair round and said kindly :
“By the way, you have some money for
me, haven’t you?” ,
“Wha-at?” I shrieked, bounding up and
looking at him with staring eyes and hair
that bristled with genuine horror.
He looked at me in a surprised, almost
dazed manner, and then said very softly:
“The money—the 10s. notes. What on
earth did you think I said?”
“Ten-bob notes!” I howled. Then I threw'
up my arms as the Great Entrepreneur did,
and went down crash.
Unfortunately, falling is not an easy thing
when one does it on purpose. To fall off a
log to order is a first-class test of histrionic
ability. I did it badly, and as I went down
the back of my head caught the corner of
my desk, and I saw a great flash of stars,
and a burst of brilliant blackness.
When I awoke I was in bed and at home.
A damp bandage was round my head. My
wife was hovering around, and a stranger
whom I guessed was a doctor was just read-
justing the sleeve of my left arm. He nodded
with a kindly expression, and faded out. I
turned over on my right side and thought
hard.
Presently my wife went out. I sat up
and tried to get out of bed. But my legs
gave way, and I rolled in again and lay
still. Then my wife re-entered and made
much fuss over me. I asked her to see if a
packet of notes was in my pocket, and was
delighted to hear her say it was.
The third day of my illness the Great En-.
trepreneur came to see me, quite recovered.
We chatted for a while and then he dived
his hand into his pocket, and, pulling out a
slip of paper, passed it to me. It was a
cheque for the amount he had borrowed to
pay the dinner.
“I quite forgot that little item till my
secretary told me you had been to see him.
Awfully sorry, I’m sure, old man.”
I swarmed out of bed and tumbled joy-
fullv into my clothes. Then I sped to the
bank and cashed that cheque, turned the
money into 10s. notes, and made great pace
to the office. The Boss smiled, sent for
whisky, and after a brief chat resumed work.
I sat down and made a start. About 19
minutes later I rose suddenly and remarked
in a horrified tone :
“By Heavens, I don’t believe I gave you
that money of yours. Good Lord!”
Then I pulled the packet of notes from
my pocket and counted out 80 10s. notes, all
new and crisp and clean. The Boss leaned
back and kept count. I turned to go back
to my desk, when I noticed he did not pick
them up. I turned back to say something,
but as I spoke the Boss slipped from his
chair to the floor and lay there in a huddled
heap.
I rang the bell. I shouted for help. I
bounded to the telephone and bawled through
it for a doctor. Then I rushed back and
straightened him out and undid his collar
The accountant came rushing up the stairs
accompanied by a doctor. The doctor went
down on his knees with difficulty, but man-
aged it somehow. When he had made his
examination he asked what had occurred. I
gave him full particulars,
“You sav he collapsed after he received
the money?”
“Yes, just slipped off the chair and went
down in a heap.”
“Then, by heavens, he must go to hospital
—he’s got the new disease in its worst form.”

A RIVER in the sea,
By forelands, beach'd and cliff’d.
The Polynesian Drift
Runs southward silently.
As spoil of wanderings
In lonely realms afar,
’Neath Tropic sun and star,
Strange loot-of-sea it brings.
Green weeds and berries red
Upon its current float,
The kelson of a boat,
A tall ship’s figure-head,
And other things also —
Perchance a drowned man
And dead leviathan.
Slow-rolling, southward go.
With mightier shapes it plays;
Ships, too, have felt its force —
Thrown back upon their course.
And backward sent for days.
The wind-abandoned sail
Falls slack —the helpless ship,
Soft-heaving in its grip,
Fights on without avail!
Upon old Ocean’s breast
An azure way at noon,
A white road ’neath the moon
It streams —a power unguessed.
Oh. soul in ceaseless strife!
Thy cares thou shalt not shift:
There runs a hostile Drift
Somewhere within thy life.
We trim our sails and take
Our bearings o’er the main;
For some ’tis all in vain—
Thev can no Northing make.
Beneath the brazen skv
Thev drift in helpless nlight,
While —engined for the fight—
The strong ships pass them by.
Thus thought I seriously
On a grey day in June —
Unon a white sand-dune
Beside the Tasman Sea.
