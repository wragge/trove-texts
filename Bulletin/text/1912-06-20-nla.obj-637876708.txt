BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and
Antiseptic virtues that have made Eumen-

BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and
Germicide, but cleanses mechanically,
owing’ to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the

A LETTER FROM LILLIPUT.
I have to write a very host
Of letters for to-morrow's post:
But (this is awkward, I confess)
I can’t remember one address,
So, in this rather public place,
I write them now, to save my face.
Dear EVERYONE, I’m busy; but
We always are, in Lilliput.
I’d far more time to write when I’d
A billet on the other side;
Still, fellows write me, day and night,
Or sometimes merely ought to write.
There’s you, dear BRADY, write that you
’LI be absent for a month or two,
And will (forsaking Madge and Winnie)
Woo Inspiration in New Guinea.
This Inspiration, mark me well,
’S a saucy jade, as I’ve heard tell;
To-day she’ll kiss you; then, old chap,
She’ll seek some other fellow’s lap.
So, should you find (among those pearls)
She sticks to you, like other girls,
Pray cable me a word. (Mark you,
I’m after Inspiration, too.)
While I remember it, dear ADAMS,
Pray stick to your smart city madams
Who keep tame cats. Your Sydney tales
c/f supple girls who swim like whales
And are most undemurely kind
Disturb me much. If you don’t mind
My saying so, it’s rough on us
Who pine in exile dolorous,
When you tempt with your Sydney tales
Of dimpled girls who swim like whales,
And when they’re moved kiss like Calypso.
Our ladies never use their lips so,
But know it’s wicked to be kind.
So—well, you see, if you don’t mind
Dear NORMAN LINDSAY, I defend
You night and day, world without end,
From solemn snails and serious slugs
Who still deride the sensual mugs
Of those lithe wenches that you draw,
So round of hip, so strong of jaw.
When critics praise your splendid line,
That sentiment is also mine ;
But, though, of course, you know what’s
best,
\ou still may let a chap suggest.
Does this thought e’er invade vour
noddle? J
“Suppose I get another model?”
If any day it should, maybe,
You’ll hand it a bouquet from me.
These fleshly hoydens flushed with wine
(A physic I would not malign)
Do credit to your master stroke,
But much embarrass feeble folk.
Quite obviously, you know best;
But if a fellow may suggest .
I dreamt last night, dear HUGH
McGRAE,
That Norman, you and I were gay
With three bacchantes (was it three?)
In a deep glade of Arcady.
The hair of one laughed at the sun,
" hich paled in the comparison.
The second’s hair, incomparable;
Was black as midnight in that hell
Where Judas sad reflection chews
With several million other Jews.
The third’s hair started to be black,
then meditated, and went back;
For all about her shapely head
A stinging subtlety of red
Intangible gleamed here and there
And disappeared; and I declare
That that so vague red subtletv
Made her the loveliest of the three*
The odorous air lay half aswoon
With rapture of the afternoon,
And things were going verv well
When I awoke in
™ , . Sa d to tell,
Ihe place in which I found myself
Is this small market-town of pelf
Where things that happen, grave or gay,
Are just the same things every day
I m very sorry that so soon
I left you, that fine afternoon.
In one girl’s hair, as I have said,
A stinging subtlety of red
Somewhat persuaded me to be
Her tutor of theology.
still—ah, me!—alack the day!—
?She S 1,e6I ,e6t ‘ laid Schernes &ang aft agley.

She liked your verses, Hugh McCrae.)
It’s very sad, dear BARR, to note
How it still grows, this country’s throat,
And every year grows drier, more
Hotly absorbent than before.
Than D R nk Bm ’ S higher ’ as y° u know,
than it was just a year ago ;
TW?!, 1 Can>t drink ’ y®"’ ll agree
that this is mighty rough on me.
No-license_ means more grog, and that’s
A thing that hits me in the slats,
Now that my innards won’t permit
Me e en to think of sampling it
When Prohibition comes—ah, me
How very drunk this place will be!
( Th’ inevitable aftermath ! —.
I’m pining ’mid the tents of Gath ;
Pining at every dull hour’s stroke
For your warm-souled Australian folk.
I want to be in Sydney soon,
And write a sonnet to the moon.
I want to sun my heart, and reach
The genial joys of Manly Beach.
I long, with longing kin of pain,
To smell old George-street once again.
I want to see the harbor-lights
That crooned to me on summer nights
A thousand years ago. I yearn
To see the great stars pulse and burn
Magnificently as they lie
On that deep-bosomed Austral sky.
Gd'od gentlemen, this scribe confesses,
He has forgotten your addresses.
He is an exile in the dim
Far distance; don’t be hard on him.
You’ll think of him, like decent chaps.
Nay when you tilt a glass, perhaps
xou 11 think, “He’s very far away, -
Where dusk lags at the'heels of da’v.
He’s all astray, as we suppose,
In Oaroaru, or towns like those
Of grim Otago or Hawkes Bay,
-Where nothing happens every day,
He's in a very lonely place.
We feel for him. God give him grace!”
And he he bids you all good-morrow.
Woo well, dear Joy. The sad minx
Sorrow
Don't know the way to kiss; so shut
Her out of doors, the whimpering slut!
Then may your glass be ne’er a
short ’un !
Yours still,
With all my heart,
(M.L.)

The Ten Best Australian Books
I Suppose you are beginning a little library.
J-lie first shelf will be devoted to Australian
boohs. Let us begin with ten—ten books
written, by Australians, or written about
Australia, that will represent, for you, the
imperishable in Australian literature. His-
tory biography, science, fiction, poetry, or
what you will, these will be in your iudg-
eut for the foundation of
oiu little library. What books would you
choose t One guinea will be paid for the
selection that comes nearest to the list com-
piled of all the selections sent in ; the win-
ning list will represent the nearest approach
to the majority judgment of the readers of
this page ot the works that will live—for
A-ustralians. Lists should be received by
this office not later than July 31. It should
noted that should any books written bv

nentioned, they arc barred.

houses which it passes, and the houses throw them-
selves upon the ’lms. And thus you arrive at “pic-
tonal conception like “The Bumping Cab” or “The
Street Entering a House.” . .
The nearest analogy to the result of the
aims of the Futurists is that of a photo-
graphic plate which has been by mistake
exposed several times, resulting in two or
I three Pictures superimposed on the same
plate. The Futurist attempts to state on
canvas, not in_ consecutive, narrative form
but in a superimposed jumble, the facts ob-
served, the associations awakened in his
teverish brain by those facts, and—say in
the case of a portrait—the emotional experi-
ences and thoughts of the sitter. The
examples, reproduced in an English paper by
color photography, are not so awful as this
definition sounds; though none would run
any risk of being bought by the trustees of
any of our galleries. Thus “Laughter”
shows a fat woman, or portion of fat
woman impinged upon by a multitude of
cate fables. Her laughter evidently pro-
ceeds from too much alcoholic stimulation in
cafe -,. A P otl, er picture shows an interior
• a ui C j l ln which the figures are cut into
jumbled fragments, just as the vision of a
drunken poet would see them. It will be
difficult .for the Post-Futurists to go much
further in the torture of art.

The Necessary Novel
W. B. Maxwell, with a long list of novels,
including the admirable Mrs. Thompson —a
study of provincial middle-class life not un-
worthy to rank with the minor work of
Arnold Bennett, is a writer sufficiently in
earnest to be deliberately dull. In Cotton
Wool (Hutchinson, per Dymock’s Library)
marks an advance in sincerity on his pre-
vious work. It is a dull, detailed, deliberate,
loosely-knit analysis of the egoist. In his
foreword he states his thesis :
‘‘l would say that one of the greatest
evils of our modern civilisation is the steady
increase of egoism. As society is now con-
stituted, a man with a moderate but assured
income can find people who in exchange for
Ins money will perform for him nearly all
the duties of manhood; and, as though he
were something infinitely delicate and ines-
timably precious, he may thus wrap himself
m cotton wool and evade the shocks and
perils of active existence. And the fact
that within the packing of cotton wool all
the best of a man lias perished, and only the
husk of a man remains, seems of no conse-
quence to any of the parties to the bargain.”
His hero, Lenny Calcraft, was well packed
in cotton wool from iiis birth. He gives up
the best years of his life in attendance on his
sick and slowly dying father —surely a strik-
ing example of unselfishness? We see, how-
ever, that the man is too lazy to strike out
for himself, too contented with his position
of pampered pet to break his comfortable
chain He is eminently a likeable chap,
looked up to by all his friends, and condes-
cending to them in the manner of the perfect
png. Marriage being out of the question
while lus father lives, he enters into other
relations with the girl he should have
married; and when he is released by his
fathers death he is too set in his bachelor
groove to undertake the new duty of mar-
riage. Generous to servants, generous in
ins impulses, his comfort gradually en-
crunches upon the performances of his lavish
promises. Installed in the perfect club, lie
drifts about London, immaculately dressed,
the perfect English gentleman—pr loafer.
He woos a wealthy widow; but as the wed-
ding day approaches he begins to find her
disturbing. lor instance, she likes her love-
making served hot:—
“He stroked her fair hair, exactly as he
used to stroke Alma’s dark hair—-with a
gentle cautious touch that could not dis-
arrange it.
“Then, after a minute, lie put his hand
round to the back of her neck, as lie had
done so often with Alma—perhaps wishing
for one of the old thrills, or proposing to
analyse the effects of a new sensation. But
the caress produced such an effect in Helen
that he could not go on quietly thinking
about himself.
“She shut her eyes, threw back her head,
and gasped ecstatically.
“ ‘Yes, do that, Lenny. Oh, .1 like that.
Hold me as if you would never let go of me
I>e rough, and fierce, and dreadful tome....'
say it, Lenny—“l have got you” ’
“‘Yes, I have got you.’
“ ‘Oh, but much more fiercely than that,
feay this —as fiercely as you can: “I have
got you, Helen, you little wretch; and you
shan t get away from me.” ’
“He had let his hand drop from her neck;
but she made him put it back again, and to
satisfy her he was obliged to repeat the
idiotic words that she had invented for him
He considered all this very silly and child-
ish and, it the truth must be confessed, not
altogether nice.”
Naturally the perfect bachelor could not
stand that. Every woman in love wants to
be called “You little wretch!” or “You little
devil!” Only then is she sure he loves her.
But Lenny began to fear that such enthusi-
asm would be rather disturbing in married
hte. The instinct of self-preservation issued
its decree. He fled.
And Lenny decays, growing ever more and
more interested in the husk of himself. A
brief episode with a common young girl
shows him that he is no longer attractive to
the sex that was his only outside in-
terest; and disillusionised, he seeks to pull
up. During a rest-cure, he reads this in-
teresting diagnosis of his own case: “The
entirely self-centred man is always a man
slowly killing himself... .Bachelors do not
usually live as long as married men ; yet no
observer of the world would maintain that
bachelors really take less care of themselves.
JNo. they are always taking care of them-
selves, and it is the care that shortens their
lives. This frightens him; and for a
moment the reader is afraid that the author
will rum Ins terrible sermon by a tardy re-
pentance. But Lenny is too old to reform.
He drifts, drifts, till his old friend calls him
what he has become, “A dirty little cad.”
llien the last development of egoism, mad-
ness. The book ends with a horrible scene
in a madhouse.
Though Maxwell did not so intend it, to
Australian eyes, In Cotton Wool is not so
much an indictment of egoism as an in-
dictment of the social conditions that allow
a man to receive an income for which he has
not worked.
In this rising tide of fiction, how is' the
unknown novelist to keep her head above
water? There are so many fairly good
novels nowadays, so many established names
firmly fixed in the minds of fiction readers,
that a new author, no matter what master-
pieces she writes, has little immediate chance
of reaching the huge reading public. Critics
will give her good notices ; the fiction-read-
ers go on their own unperturbed way, placidly
browsing on their accustomed fart*. Desper-
ately, she thinks out some little notion that
will give her book an odd flavor, a sugges-
tion of strangeness, or, best of all, a hint of
personal appeal. Anonymity has its uses,
but not bare anonymity. She must have be-
hind her a publisher who has command of
sufficient advertising funds to make the pub-
lic interested in the secret, to attribute the
story to this popular writer or that, and to
keep her readers guessing.
The most successful of these dodges is
He Who Passed, dedicated to “M.L.G.,” by
the anonymous author (Ileinemann, per
George Robertson). This book professes to
be the authentic confession of a woman
who, because •of her past, had re-
fused to marry a man who, believ-
ing her unsullied, had fallen in love
with her. She tells us that she felt that she
could not explain to “M.L.G.” the extenuat-
ing circumstances of her upbringing; she
Could not to his face make her apology for
her own life. And now, the palpable fake. Into
this book she. poured her story, in the hope
that “M.L.G.” would read and forgive. It
is apparent from the writing that the woman
knows the man’s address. Having written
her defence, what was to prevent her send-
ing the manuscript to him? She sent it to
her publishers. She may not get her lover’s
forgiveness, but she will get thumping roy-
alties.
J*
But the story, as fiction, is admirably
written. So, too, are other stories. But this
one, thanks to the fake, will be widely read.
The authoress depicts with delightful real-
ism the upbringing, haphazard and cruel, of
a little American girl, the daughter of stage
folk, herself destined to make a name as an
actress. Education she had none, save the
education ( of an exciting and changeful life;
she uncovers the cruelties and the crudities
of stage life with an unsparing hand. Her
code of honor was the code of her environ-
ment: "My idea was that every girl who
wanted to succeed must get some rich man
to help her up the ladder, unless she had
rich relations. It was part of the game of
lile, 1 thought.” So when her chance came,
she took i t,_ and along with it the disagree-
able theatrical manager, whose notice she
had attracted. It was “part of the game”
for her to be his mistress. She was surely
the first actress who achieved her start by a
scream. She had to scream once at the
climax of an act —the scream of a woman
murdered. The play centred in this charac-
ter, who never appeared on the stage. Helped
bv her memories of a sordid tragedy of her
childhood, she made her scream the best line
in the piece. And she took, without too much
squeamishness, the part of the manager’s
mistress, and profited by the alliance. But
gradually she learnt her lesson, and by the
time she met “M.L.G.,” she had lived dowm
her past.
I he book, despite the fake of its origin, is
a very subtle analysis of the mind of a
woman that so long was only the mind of an
unmoral child. And the life she depicts the
author certainly knows —and pictures with
a literary art quite incompatible with her
identification with her heroine.
For its delightful illustrations but not
for its labored Japanese humor will My
Tdcalcd John Bullesses, by Yoshio Markino
(Constable) be liked. This Japanese artist
is, for our tastes, altogether too interested
in the female John Bull. His broken Eng-
lish, occasionally possessing the quaintness
of a child of three, becomes wearisome long
before the end of the book. TVe know what
the Jap thinks of his woman-kind. His
point of view occasionally emerges. “For men
aie fiaud all over the world. Almost every
man is searching the woman’s weak point
to take his advantage One of them asked
me, ‘Do you agree with the dancing?’ ‘Yes,’
I reply. ‘ln England. You may dance with
the .John Bullesses. But with Japanese
women I don’t know. It all depends on
what state of mind they have. . . .They are
trained admirably pure" and sacred! They
are just lik e the electric wire covered with
insulating medium. Perhaps they may have
a strong electricity of the passionate love
inside of their heart, but they are quite safe,
jcou shan t feel their electricity by dancing,
llieir insulating medium is the British pa-
tent.. ...If we want to dance in our coun-
try, first of all we must prepare insulating
medium to cover ourselves absolutely well,
otherwise the dancing is dangerous, for we
might be easily drowned into the silliest
infatuation!’” However, he reports that
several times he fell in love with John Bull-
esses, but “unfortunately none of them could
love me. Unfortunately! One could do
without, the rather foolish, and certainly
“fill’ criticism of the English woman; but
Markino is an artist, and his drawings are
of the daintiest beauty.

‘ J , o e - Th. e place was immune from the ravages of
othpF°ri lal r Stl< ;- Tlge /’ Factor y. .Acts, Mining Laws and
other destructive fauna. Fijian officialdom seemed
to be slumbering and altogether the time was dead
ripe for a masterly exhibition of Private Enterprise
government. It arrived safely. Amongst other
things the co. labored under the delusion that be-
cause it paid a man’s wages, it bought him body and
soul, in working hours and afterwards as well Not
only did it specify the amount of der-rink a man
should put into his mouth, but prescribed also that
he should not have the use of that mouth for the
purposes of singing or playing a musical instrument
r •i er /° ■■ -This *n one’s own house! Good old
Liberty of the Subject, that Private Enterprise says
it loves so much !
Like most wealthy Bull companies, it was intensely
loyal and patriotic in a cheap, clamant way; but
if it loved its dear country much it loved its cheap
colored brother more. Its absorbing love for him
led it to replace a white artisan with a Japanese
whenever opportunity offered. It offered fairly often
Wowser-like, social purity was a strong point
with the co., and any philandering with the brown
belles was punished with deportation for life The
co. loved to glue its eye to the keyhole “in the in-
terest of Public Morality.” Needless to say, the in-
sane attempts to force sexual starvation on a staff
of mostly virile men was a colossal failure. A
series of sensational court cases shattered the man-
agement s dreams; and as various favorites fell off
their pedestals and sat among the wreckage of their
reputations, they were presented with the sack
That started things, and resignations have been pour-
M'g ih ever since. The staff has evidently realised
that unfettered Private Enterprise is plain Sheol,
and it has been getting back to Labor-cursed Aus-
tralia.
In other respects things have been changing.
To-day, for instance, the kanaka has the sympathetic
ear of Fijian officialdom, which until less than
three years ago seemed dead. In those days the co.
was proud and arrogant. It forgot it was only the
P.P.C., and thought itself the Trinity. It didn’t
take the Government into consideration at all. It
maintained its own “calabush” (lock-up) and com-
missioner of police, and the managers acted the parts
of Judges. Boys were sentenced to work overtime
during the week and Saturday afternoons as well, to
the financial benefit and glory of the P.P.C. This
was termed “maintaining discipline.”
At last somebody woke up, and a person with an
axe ordered a sewerage system, sanitary conveniences,
new labor houses, and a new hospital for the kanaka
toilers. Dysentery had been exacting a heavy toll
among the boys, and strong measures were needed to
check it. The “calabush” fell in with a loud
crash. The police commissioner had his title and
his job changed. To-day, if a boy offends, he is
proceeded against in the court, not in the manager’s
office. The co. nearly burst in six places when all
these things struck it at once.
The Tory person is never tired of explaining
that the prevalence of strikes is due to “Labor domi-
nation.” Yet, on this happy isle, where a unionist
is classed with the Devil, labor troubles are not
unknown. Not amongst the helpless whites does the
trouble brew, but amongst the “gentle, obedient
kanakas.” Quite recently the co. wanted to re-
arrange its working hours so as to facilitate shipping
—a reasonable and fair proposition. Brown brother
bucked unanimously. A few hundreds of him had to
be gaoled for a month to settle that argument. As
usual, very little of that affair filtered through the
press.
As to the money that is in this dirt heap. About
18 months ago London Truth printed a par.
stating that the capital of the highly-secretive co.
was £500,000, of which £50,000 had been paid up,
the remaining nine-tenths being “water.” On all
this (my latest information on the point is about
18 months old) it paid a paltry dividend of 35 per
cent., and in addition had returned a beggarly
£135,000 to the shareholders in the form of tobacco
money or bonus or something.

The St. Leger course on Doncaster (Eng.)
town moor, where races have been run for 150 years,
more or less, is said to be the covering of immense
coal deposits. Sanguine estimates of the new dis-
covery promise an annual output of 10 million tons,
and as the Town Moor is municipal property, the
coal mine will have to be worked as an unexpected
development of Socialism. There can’t be any pri-
vate ownership of old Doncaster racecourse and the
wealth beneath.

“Y.Z.”: The outbreak of nerves, resulting from
the burglar invasion, has led to an extraordinary
demand for dogs in Melbourne. A man I met
yesterday afternoon told me he had taken out a
string of five in the morning, and had disposed of
them' all in an hour. He did not say they were his
own dogs. Naturally, no stray dog is safe, and the
metropolitan official who collects loose, lost and un-
owned hounds has a sinecure. Even sausage spaniels
are unobtainable anywhere. The general faith in
Carlo rests on delusion, too; witness the St. Kilda
case of a recent midnight, when a Hebraic cit, in-
vestigating a fearful racket in his back yard, found
the faithful canis familiaris holding down a yelling
John Hop by the neck, while a suspected person in
possession of family jewels reasonably supposed to
have been stolen faded over the garden wall.
“Simon”: Any manufacturer will tell you that foi
durability and price the pig’s top coat cannot com-
pare with the Australian soft-tanned cow-hide
known as bag-leather, nor with the shirt of the
yearling calf. But the public has a strange, linger-
ing belief in pigskin, and a hog-seat will sell an
otherwise brumrny saddle. Practically no hogskins
are treated in Australia, which seems remarkable,
seeing the demand and the wealth of raw material
Perhaps a. good duty would put the industry on its
feet. But even if it did, the old objections would
remain. Pigskin is completely perforated by bristle-
h.oles ’ an<l is therefore porous in the first degree •
also, there is little natural grease in a pig-covering’
i’, 1 " consequence, it is a ready absorber of
weather, for which reason it soon perishes. That's
why you will never find hogskin in boots, though
otherwise it would be suitable.

Gives New Life to the Invalid
An outstanding feature in “Wincarnis” is its
extraordinary power in re-creating lost vitality
and giving new life and renewed health to
those who, after a long illness, are left in
a pitiable state of wrecked health and
shattered nerves.
Renewed Strength to the Weak
Every wineglassful of “Wincarnis” equips
the system with a definite amount of renewed
health and strength that overcomes weak-
ness and exhaustion, and speedily gives to
the whole body a delicious feeling of physical
fitness that is lasting.
Increased Vigor to Brain Workers
When the delicate mechanism of the brain
becomes disorganised by overwork, worry,
or by the ever-increasing demands of
modern business conditions, “Wincarnis”
has an immediate effect in stimulating
the activity of the brain and promoting
additional keenness and increased vigor
to the whole mental system, thereby
ensuring the brain-worker against future
breakdown.
A Wealth of Health to Everyone
To everyone whose health is not as it should
be—to those suffering from Anaemia, Sleep-
lessness, Weakness, Brainfag, Lowered
Vitality, Exhaustion, Nerve Troubles, or who
are merely “rundown” —“Wincarnis” offers a
wealth of renewed health and a progressive
upbuilding of vitality and vigor that will
make the whole system pulsate with new
life. Over 10,000 doctors recommend
“Wincarnis.” Will you try just one bottle?

CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“After touring Japan and In dia two years ago, I returned home with
Bandsmann’s Opera Co., and was attacked with malarial fever, con-
tracted in India.
“I was in bed for four months, suffering at times with ague, and other
severe phases of the disease.
“It did not matter what clothes were put on me, I could never keep
warm. At one time my mother felt that my heart had ceased to beat.
Five doctors attended me, and did a great deal for me, but I did not get
right or strong.
“A lady friend recommended me a large bottle of your tonic, sure it
would cure me.
“I took six bottles, and was never Fetter in my life. To show how
well I am, I have been allotted a loading part in a play about to be
produced. “(Signed) RUBY VIOLETTA MUNRO.”

IMPROVE YOUR FIGURE
Every Thin Woman can be Fully Developed.
Every Fat Person can be Safely Reduced to Normal.
THIN WOMEN
If you are flat-chested, thin,
run down and scraggly—even if
you never had a nicely-rounded
bosom, Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-
food will build you up and de-
velop your figure. Does your
mirror mock you? l-lesh-food
will remove the faults in your
figure by rounding out and de-
veloping the deficient places.
Put up in Tablet form, it is
easy to use and pleasant to
take, and, if desired, may be
taken secretly. Taken under
our directions, it will work wonders for your
appearance.
In many cases bust measurements have been
increased by over ten inches, and the weight
over five pounds weekly. Other cases have
shown an increase in weight of even a pound
a day. The average bust increase desired is
about six inches, and is readily accomplished.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development
to the thousands of chronically thin women
who have despaired of ever possessing a pre-
sentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food
treatment that adds weight and permanent de-
velopment to attenuated women.
FAT PEOPLE
Excess fat injures your health,
impedes your movements, and
makes you the butt of your un-
feeling normal-weight friends.
People who have been fat, and are
now reduced to normal, think
other fat people ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat in-
jure your health and endanger
your existence, it absolutely —-—
destroys your figure and makes you a ludicrous
sight. Why do you stay fat? “ FATCURE”
positively removes excess fat, and will restore
your spoiled figure to decent and pleasing pro-
portions, and is always a sure and lasting cure
for obesity and corpulency. A few doses im-
proves your breathing wonderfully, and the
course of treatment will cure you.
Is the only successful, and, at the same time,
harmless, fat-reducer that has ever been dis-
covered. Its efficacy has been undeniably de-
monstrated in thousands of successfully treated
cases. It is totally and absolutely non-poison-
ous, and can in no wise work any injury to the
general health; though it often reduces excess
weight by as much as a pound a day.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Threnody.
The Welshman’s speed in hitting and quickness
puzzled Poesy, who, however, fought with grim deter-
mination until in the 12th round he was knocked
out by a heavy right on the jaw. Driscoll started
favorite at five to two. Poesy was warned for “but-
ting.”—English pug\ news.
Pile crape upon the poet’s head.
In sporting cables news has come
That strikes all bards for ever dumb:
The Muse of Poesy is dead.
Alack, there seems no room for doubt:
A heavy right upon the jaw
From Jimmy Driscoll’s hairy paw,
And Poesy was down and out.
This is, as everybody knows,
An age of prose—an age of “pros.”
The Muse is beaten by the Pug,
Her inspiration laughed to scorn:
“The foam of perilous seas... forlorn”
Is foam upon a two-pint jug.
The modern world its judgment gave,
And Poesy, we feared, would lose
(Odds five to two against the Muse) ;
And so I dig her lonely grave.
She strove against the brutal bunch
That in this age of callous force
Cares not for Poesy (of course,
It worried her, Jim’s kidney punch!)
The empty victory she scorned,
But battled till the dozenth round,
And in her puny efforts found
That she for “butting” in was “warned.”
Ah, Muse of mine, you were too rash.
You stood a dozen dreadful rounds
To win for me a thousand pounds;
You knew how much I wanted cash.
Your charm was naught to modern men,
Your inspiration vaih, because
The spirit of the age it was,
That referee who counted ten!
An age of cash and bash, God knows,
An age of prose—an age of “pros” !

On An Old Resident.
The death has occurred of an old resident.-
—Regular daily paper item.
Gentle reader, you and I,
Soon or later, have to die.
From this weary world of woe
Residents are bound to go.
(Rank as district residents,
Even kings and presidents.)
For the flesh to which we cling
Is a merely mortal thing.
If the cord of life be strong,
Then, with luck, we linger long.
(Lots of fun and levity
Lead not to longevity.)
But -at last it has to snap,
Letting down the oldest chap.
Cord becomes a slender thread,
Then it breaks, and you are dead,
(Studehts of humanity
Murmur, “All is vanity.”)
On this world’s extensive stage,
Youth is vain, and so is age.
Youth may die and turn to dust.
As for Age—my Word ! it must.
(Princes, kings and presidents
Die like aged residents.)

O.K.
The Derelict.
I paps her on my way to work
And as I hurry home again.
She is not old, she is not young,
She is not fair, she is not plain;
But in her ever-watchful eyes
A something sour and ugly lies.
It seems to me as though she looks
With restless, grim intolerance
Upon the whole wide world, like one
Who sits neglected at a dance,
And knows that she must be alone
Until her hateful life is done.
Gay sweethearts, children, husbands, wives-
A universe of selfish bliss —-
Drift by her window ceaselessly ;
She may not know one lover’s kiss,
Nor man nor child on her depends
Whose hateful world holds only “friends.”
The months merge swiftly into years,
And each of them is like the last;
With dull despair she estimates
The drab, grey future by the past;
And every day some old dream dies
Behind her sad and hungry eyes.
We make a show of sympathy
With those who “fall,” and so are “lost,”
And yet I think that when one comes
To reckon up the final cost,
These “lost ones” should not so much move
Our hearts as she who loses love.

In a City Restaurant.
I saw you to-day in a heated room,
Caught the glance of your serious eyes,
And back it came, like a wildbird’s tune,
Or a late-blown rose in a Queensland June,
The far, blue, star-lit skies;
The water lapping the black-piled wharf,
The coal punt lumbering, the tug between,
And the red port light and the starboard’s green
Where the deep grey river lies.
The bamboos brushing the sodden grass,
The cricket only an unseen song,
Driftwood that parted the star reflex,
Where wanton ripples the still pools vex,
Or a boat wash spreads along.
Back it came like a spicy wind
In a barren land on a brazen noon,
Like a violet patch in a desert set,
Or the rain-drawn sweetness of mignonette,
Or, in storm-wracked skies, a moon.
And I felt the breath of the river rise,
And the kiss of flower and dew,
Faint moth-wings drifting from beds of b100m....
Till my eyes grew blind to the wide, hot room,
And my world held.. .only you !

THE FOOTBALL TYRANNY.
There is a possibility that militarism will interfere with what is perhaps the most popular intercollegiate event of the year—the annual football contest between St. Peter's
and Prince Alfred Colleges. Almost a tone of alarm at that prospect was sounded by the Head Master of St. Peter’s College (Rev. H. Girdlestone) at a smoke social of old
blues on Friday evening. “All cadets will have to parade for inspection by the Governor-General on the date of this year’s football match. I have written to the military
authorities explaining that the Saturday in question is the only possible date upon which the match can be played, and that it cannot possibly be altered. I have let it rest at
that, but if any of you have any influence with the military I hope you will be able to move them.” (Hear, hear.) —Adelaide paper.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vei tisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the haitor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, Tiie Bulletin ”is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

MAORILAND’S PRIOR LIEN
DEBENTURES.
The fact that Maoriland asked for £4,000,000
the other day in London, at over 4 per cent,
interest, and repayable in two years, at-
tracted some attention to Ward’s much
pawn-ticketed isles. Especially the two-year
device attracted attention. There is a trick
in the wild-cat industi’y by which a company
begins with so much capital in ordinary
shares, and then —wanting more capital and
finding its prospects gloomy—it issues pref-
erence shares. It may even issue two kinds
of them —plain preference and cumulative.
People will put up money on preference
shares when they wouldn’t touch ordinaries
with a long pole, for the preference crowd
has a first call on all the assets. The ordin-
ary holders are mad, of course, but they give
way in the hope that the money put up by
the preference push-will save the company,
and incidentally themselves, from ruin.
Later, when things have become worse even
than before, .and money is raised on deben-
tures which have the first claim of all, both
the preference and ordinary shareholders
feel mad —the preference folk because they
lose their first claim, and the ordinaries
because their second claim becomes a third
one. But they both gave way, as mentioned
above, for the reason already indicated.
Later still, when in the struggle for exist-
ence and more money, a new gang of prior
lien debenture-holders is put in front of
wSS’ ori f inal debenture-holders
h iff - Wl i d a ? the Preference sharehold-
ers, nut it is too late to say much. Every-
body is pawning the future in the hope of
redeeming the past. As for the ordinary
tbnf e iu lders ’ they reco & n i s e by this time
K n h 7 are away in the back row. and
they no longer trouble to become wild. When
the final smash arrives, it is probable that
the bank has first claim of all, and the prior
cultv de nn^ tU fi e ' hold a i:s are paid with diffi-
culty, and the ordinary debenture-holders
get a mere scrap, and the cumulative prefer-
ence and plain preference shareholders get
nothing, and the ordinary crowd gets the
boot and calls and possibly abuse. If there
are deferred shareholders at the back of
b V e e ment?o g ned eir position is to ° horrible to
this complicated wild c-atism is re-
called to memory by recent Maoriland financ-
P g - f S°« d “any years ago Maoriland
beg a n to notice that its loans would one day
tall due, and it resolved to take Abbaiiaai
by the forelock. Without waiting for the
d fy °£ redemption, it proceeded to offer its
stock-holders liberal terms for a postpone-
ment. Thus, in exchange for £19,724,400 of
old loans falling due between 1877 and 1900
inrn d t >ei^ l l ade, 3 its creditors, by the year
1900, to take £21,325,302 of 4 per cent
securities falling due in 1929. It postponed
another lot to 1939, and a third lot to 1945.
-Lhe total loss on the deal or dodge or
rn, ggl |t u ? - to i 1 ,90 was nearly £2,100.000.
lhe Dominion kept on at the “Conversion”
business till it has now over £29,000,000
MiPS d ! le 111 over £15,000,000 in
1939, and over £9,000,000 in 1945 By in-
ducing a great mass of its old stock-holders
to exchange their ancient and whiskered
securities, before they fell due, for long-
.,at?p aew one .s, it, in a great measure, saved
itseit from going on the market for renewal
loans, and avoided putting ’ its credit to a
very awkward test. What will happen in
ly-J no one knows, but on present appear-
ances it may be something pretty serious,
lhen, having postponed the early lOU into
the dim distance, Maoriland started to issue
preference shares and debentures. That is
to say, as lenders might not feel too good
about securities repayable after 1929 —the
year when any old thing may happen—it
decided to issue loans repayable before that
iateiul date. . This made the new loans better
xv-irvlrt the 1929 crowd worse.
By 1910, of short-dated or com-
paratively short-dated loans had been put in
f: roat of the big debt of 1929. This looked
about the limit in the way of issuing prefer-
ence stock, but there were other resources
ffinJL 19111 ' the Dominion raised nearly
±5,000,000, repayable in November, 1914, so
these lenders came in ahead of almost all
previous lenders. They were the real prior
lien folk, and looked as if they would be safe,
whatever happened. Yet even tliev have
been beaten out of their position, for, as
already mentioned, the Thriftless Isles have
just borrowed £2,000,000, at high interest
repayable in July, 1914. So these final lend-
ers get ahead of even the lenderk of 1910
and become the copper-bottomed first mort-
gage crowd, hall-marked and with the name
blown in the bottle. And unless another
loan is put in ahead of them they will remain
in that position.

Taking Government and local debts to-
gether, this is how things have grown in
recent years:—
Maoriland Public and Local Debts.
Increase Increase
5 years. per year (average).
1892-1896 .. £4,915,324 £983,064
1897-1901 .. 7,365,947 1;473,189
1902-1906 .. 15,754,777 3,150,955
1907-1911 .. 23,896,642 4,779,328
So it is no wonder that Maoriland has got
down to floating the most temporary kind
of lOU to go on with. And part of the
money it has just raised by such tough ex-
pedients goes to pay for the Dreadnought
winch the Dominion shoved on its unwilling
father Bull ! There is a certain irony
about raising the money for an unwelcome
present by such hard expedients. It is diffi-
cult to avoid the conviction that Maoriland
is approaching a crisis of some sort. It is,
in a sense, the parasite of a parasite. Aus-
tralia borrows locally and in England.
Maoriland borrows locally, in Australia and
m England. Australia is England’s parasite.
Maoriland is Australia’s deputy parasite, or
sub-bug, or secondary flea. Maoriland owes
on its Public Debt account much more per
head than Australia does —nearly £2O more
per head. If local debts are included, the
position is even worse, and Maoriland is
£3O per head more deeply bogged than this
country. A much larger proportion of its
debt is owing to foreign creditors than in
Australia’s case, and the foreign creditor is
always a danger, for his existence puts a
country’s credit at the mercy of foreign
financial complications. A much larger pro-
portion of its debt is unremunerative. Fur-
ther, Maoriland has proportionately much
less money—the kind of money which is the
final argument on the Day of Judgment (or,
rather the Day of Judgment summons). It
has much more than a fifth of the Common-
wealth’s population, and much less than a
fifth of the Commonwealth’s stock of coin.
It has no Government gold reserve as Aus-
tralia has. Its banks have less coin than
the Australian ones in proportion to their
liabilities, Also, its bank deposits have
diminished during the last year, which is
no cheerful sign. The situation of the Aus-
tralian banks is not too good, seeing that,
between March, 1911, and March, 1912, their
deposits only increased by £9,277,512. while
their advances increased by £11,486,534.
This difference of £2,209,022 was a consider-
able strain on their resources. But the de-
posits of the Maoriland banks diminished by
£345,741, while their advances increased by
£3,334,015, which meant that the extra strain
on their resources amounted to £3.679,756.
Maoriland is taking magnificent risks these
days.
RACE SUICIDE.
The Race Suicide goblin had a day out
recently, there being at the moment a
dearth of political news and a partial famine
in other forms of intelligence. The French
vital statistics for 1911 had arrived by
cable, and the figures showed 776,983 deaths
and 742,114 births, therefore the population
revealed a decrease of over 34,000. The
same sort of thing happened in 1907, and
probably on some other occasions. Now, it
is the doctrine of the cheaper variety of
pressman that the only proof of a nation’s
vitality is its constant increase. It must
grow, even if the country has already more
people than it can feed ; in fact, even if it
has twice or three times as many people as
it can feed it must go on growing just the
same. The firm conviction of the stereo-
typed person who preaches the Race Suicide
doctrine is that the chief end of man is to
be a sort of rabbit, and to keep multiplying
till he dies of hunger, or suffocation," or
through skull-fracture, caused by his over-
crowded fellow-man standing on his head to
breathe, or to look at the town clock, or
something. With this idea in view, quite
a number of papers arose a few days ago,
and wrote the epitaph of glorious old
r ranee. There were sunsets and swan
songs and dead leaves in their story. The
hnai rose of summer shed a dying fragrance
over the scene, and there were autumn tints
in it, and suggestions of the Last of the
Mohicans and the boy who stood on the
burning deck. The epitaphs were all much
the same. This, for instance, was from
feydney Telegraph :
r , A 3 h f eat Fr f nc h race is dying. Slowly and
peacefully as yet, but nevertheless inevitably For
unless a miracle happens the decline that has now
begun must prove cumulative and accelerate its pace
as the generations pass. The full meiping of the
loss of 35,000 people to France last year will not
appear until the time when under normal conditions
e 6l r natural increase and the duplicating increase
of that increase might have been looked for.
It is because ' this cumulative loss on the
diminished birth-rate which began back in
the last century is only now making’ its
appearance in the statistics that the nation has
at last ceased to be reproductive. And if decay is
to go on begetting decav. as mathematically it must
after a certain, stage has been passed, the progress
towards vanishing point must become swifter every
year. The one ray of hope, etc.
* * * *
All this sort of thing sets one wondering
whether suffocation is really the legiti-
mate ambition of mankind. Plainly, the
human race can’t go on increasing indefi-
nitely. It has done marvels in that way
during the last century, but in a great many
countries the process will have very shortly
to slow down. If England had gone on
ever since the Conquest at the rate
of the last hundred years, it would
some time this century hold some
five hundred thousand million people, and
the three bottom layers would be smoth-
ered. They couldn’t even get decent burial,
for the top layer wouldn’t dare to stoop,
well knowing that if it once departed from
the perpendicular it would never get a
chance to rise again. Any intermediate
layer of humanity that wasn’t dead would
be mad, and would absolutely refuse to
listen to reason, and would probably bite
those above it. Again, if the expansion of
England goes on for the next 500 years at
the rate of the last hundred, the country will
contain some 28,000 million people, and as
that will be more than 800 to the acre, the
situation is equally impossible. Therefore,
if a stoppage of increase shows that a nation
is doomed, the fair and reasonable inference
is that all nations are doomed, and that as
regards a great many of them, the doom
will have to start working very shortly, or
worse things will happen to them. Barring
the arrival of that doom Europe will be-
come a sort of overcrowded sheep-truck or
Black Hole of Calcutta —a most desirable
place, according to those who hold that
humanity’s one purpose in life is to multi-
ply, and that it must keep on doing it for
ever and ever, or else burst.

The population question ought to be con-
sidered sanely and reasonably, like every
other question. A country wants sufficient
people to defend it, therefore Australia is
grievously under-populated. But it doesn’t
want so njany people that they will become
poverty-stricken, diseased, stunted, bow-
legged and lost to the decencies of life
through living a whble family or two
families in one room. It may be over-
stocked just like a sheep run. It may be
lost in war-time for want of sufficient
defenders, but it may be lost a great deal
worse because the countless myriads of its
people have, through the degeneracy that
comes of congestion and poor living, ceased
to have any value as defenders. A country
begins to lapse into a diseased condition
when it becomes so full of people that it can
no longer feed its own population. Then its
military and naval burdens multiply, for it
has not only to defend itself, but also to be
able, at a push, to defend the countries on
which it relies for food, and to protect its
lines of communication with these countries.
If its enemies can cut off its supplies, then
the more defenders it has the more quickly it
perishes, for every unfed defender is an
additional danger. He represents so much
more call on the provisions while he is
alive, and so much more burial expense
when he ceases to be alive. But even with-
out active war the very thickly peopled
country, with the steady increase of popula-
tion and the habit of depending on foreign
food supplies, is doomed. Great Britain
living on imported victuals, is probably the
most completely doomed of the lot. It trusts
more than any other land to the surplus
food of more thinly-peopled regions. As
these fill up they cease to have surplus
food to sell. It is only about 70 years
since the British Isles began to rely, as
a regular thing, on imported food, and ’this
reliance has increased till they now
trust to the foreigner for about ten
months furnishment of victuals every year
Most of the countries that supplied them 50
years or 60 years ago have now retired from
the business for the reason that they require
all their own wheat for their own consump-
tmn, and several of the countries that are
It - 1 ! n o the business, like the
United States, have every year a smaller
and smaller surplus to spare. The United
Kingdom may not be accused of what
the cheap nressmen calls Race Suicide; but
unless it finds that article it is likely to
strike such a trouble as history has never yet
recorded.
* * * *
To put the matter shortly, the world has
within the last century, come up against ii
problem that it never, so far as history re-
lates, Diet with before. Considering that
England .(and if is not quite an isolated
case) gained nearly three times as much
population between 1801 and 1901 as it
did in all the previous millions of years
since the Creation, the problem is a very
sudden one. If the increase, among the
thickly peopled States with the big birth-
rates goes on for another century at the
same rate, the situation will become utterly
squalid, indecent and unspeakable. Pro-
bably France, which is said to be dying, has
chosen a better part than some of its neigh-
bors. _ It contains about 39,000,000 people.
The increase is almost imperceptible. With
190 folk to the square mUe it has apparently
quite enough. The Frenchman has still
room to breathe, to grow a few trees and
pot-plants, to look out on the open air, to
cultivate most of its own food supply,, to
raise a muscle, which is the thing you carry
a spade or a rifle with, and to consider the
sky without having to stand on top of a
suffocated neighbor or grandfather to do it.
The idea that he is a failure and a ruin unless
he increases till there are 380 of him to the
square mile, and then 760, and then 1520,
and then till there is one of him to every
square yard, and he becomes a heaving mass
like a rabbit pilgrimage, isn’t logical.
Among the empty countries (there are
hardly any of them now) and the thinly-
peopled countries (there are few of them)
the future is for the one that gets people,
provided they are of the right sort. Among
the sufficiently-populated countries the future
is for the one that doesn’t get any more
people. Among the over-populated regions,
the chance is for the one that judiciously
gets rid of people. Perhaps, despite its
long and chequered career, the real history
of France is just beginning. There should
be a great history ahead of a brilliant and
capable race which knows the right time to
commit what the cheap and muddled press
calls suicide. Many nations may yet die
for want of suicide.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Demand for the Importation of
Money.
Tiie commercial class is one of the most
ignorant in Australia, but its confidence in
itself never fails, and its belief in foreign-
borrowing is eternal. This, for instance, is
from the share circular of a Sydney firm,
quoted apparently with approval by the Syd-
ney Telegraph :
It is time the Government suspended local borrow-
ing. All money for heavy expenditure on under-
takings such as railways, waterworks, and other
permanent developmental work should be borrowed
in wealthier markets, as the drain on local resources
is too severe, using up money which would otherwise
be available for private enterprise. To clear the
market of money for railway construction is to
check the settlement which the railways are built to
promote.
Yet even the most commercial person on
earth should be able to see that borrowing
doesn’t, of itself, deplete the local money
market. If a Government raises, say,
£1,000,000 locally, for local works, and
builds these works out of locally-made
material, the £1,000,000 is in the country
when the business is finished just as it was
before the business was begun. In fact, the
position may be said to be improved. 'Before
the work commenced there was £1,000,000 in
the country. After it is finished, the coun-
try contains (1) the same old £1,000,000;
(2) a railway or something of the sort pre-
sumably worth £1,000,000; (3) Government
securities to the nominal value of £1,000,000.
On the other side of the account, there is a
liability of £1,000,000 to the holders of the
securities, but still the money remains, and
the railway is a gain. Of course, if the rail-
wav doesn’t pay interest on its cost —either
because there is too much railway, or a lot
of ill-constructed railway, or some over-ex-
pensive railway, or a great deal of badly-
placed railway—then a serious drain on the
Treasury sets in, and a loss begins to be evi-
dent. And if there are too many securities
in circulation, they may become depreciated
just like over-abundant shares or superfluous
cheese. And if railways are built too fast,
there may be so many men employed on the
job that the rest of the men can’t supply the
ordinary needs of the country, whereupon
the country will begin to import heavily,
and to send away its money recklessly to
pay for foreign goods, and thus become short
of cash. But these are side issues. The
central fact is that “local- borrowing” is not
in itself a “drain on local resources.” It is
not in itself a process which tends to “clear
the market of money.” The things which are
a drain on local resources,” and which “clear
the market. of money” are (1) foreign bor-
rowing, which involves a constant exjport of
money to pay interest, and (2) the importa-
tion of foreign goods, and the export of money
to pay for them. Some of the goods may be
material for railway construction, but these
are not imported because the railway con-
struction money was borrowed locally ; they
are imported because the country hadn’t
sense enough to protect and foster its own
iron and steel industry. These are not points
that are likely to appeal to the commercial
class,_ which is a very dull-witted and self-
sufficient class— -Bartoline Saddletree,
that eminent Auld Reekie merchant depicted
by Walter Scott, was a fair representative
or it. But other classes may possibly con-
sider them.
Jervis Bay Gets a Sort of a Lift.
Certain recent remarks about the creation
of a new port at Jervis Bay (N.S.W.), to
relieve the congestion of Sydney, may be re-
garded here and there as a sign that the
McGowen-HolmaN Government repents of
the ruinous policy of dragging everything to
the metropolis. Jervis Bay, so long and
persistently neglected, shows signs of coming
into fashion as the outlet of Riverina, and
some, people may look on the awakening as
genuine. To The Bulletin it has the ear-
marks of fraud. It looks as if the parochial
hatred of every N.S.W. port that isn’t Syd-
ney had merely been overcome, to some ex-
tent, by the parochial hatred of the Com-
monwealth. When the Sydney congestion
crowd, which was partly Carruthers and
partly Wade and partly McGowen and
other people, toiled furiously to get the Aus-
tralian capital placed at Yassberra, as close
as possible to Sydney, the idea of a Federal
port at Jervis Bay was held out as a bait.
It proved, later on, to be about the poorest,
meanest bait imaginable. The Federal port
eventuated as two or three square miles of
land, with little space for a town, no water
catchment area, no room to dispose of sew-
age, and no commercial opportunities what-
soever. The scrap of Federal territory was
to end at high-water mark, so that at low
tide there would be a strip of State-owned
beach between it and the sea. It would be


impossible to build even a Federal boat-
wharf at the wonderful Federal port. The
Commonwealth was to own a narrow bit of
land down 'to the spot where the highest
wave attained twice a day, but the wet
beach in front and the wet sea that lay
before the wet beach it was not to own. In a
commercial sense the earth would be of no
value to one authority, and the sea would
be useless to the other. It w T as a beautifully
parochial device, but it began to break
down through the dead weight of its own
meanness. Already there have been denjands
for more room, and for sheer shame’s sake
one or two concessions had to be made. The
position of N.S.W., as the State which
started a Federal movement, and then re-
fused to go on with it unless it was bribed
with the possession of the capital, and then
professed to feel itself wronged and insulted
when required to furnish adequate space for
that same capital, became to<3 difficult. It
began to seem probafile (hat, in one way or
another, the Federal city would get a real
sea-outlet at Jervis Bay. Either the attempt
to shut the Federal port in at high-water
mark must be abandoned and a Federal coastal
city must arise, or an attempt must be made
to shunt the reasonable Federal claims by
the establishment of a State port, which
would try to secure the trade of the Aus-
tralian capital. Consequently, there came
about a sudden appreciation of Jervis Bay,
from a purely State point of view,
and a discovery that it is the. true and
natural water-gate of Riverina. As a matter
of fact, so far as the N.S.W. southern coast
is concerned, Twofold Bay clamors much
more loudly for recognition. A Govern-
ment with a large Australian outlook would
have granted all Jervis Bay to the Common-
wealth, and let it create a port there with
the money of all Australia, while it devoted
itself to developing the great harbor further
south, thus giving a chance in life to the
long neglected regions of Monaro and Eastern
Gippsland. The N.S.W. Government isn’t
e«;ual to that sort of Australian outlook.
Still, it can see that there are points about
Jervis Bay as a State outlet when there is
danger of it otherwise becoming a Federal
outlet. And if there was a chance of Two-
fold Bay or Port Stephens becoming a Fed-
eral seaport it would possibly gain recogni-
tion as a promising State seaport also. Thus
out of cussedness comes good—not much
good, but still a little.
A Weary Old Gag.
If N.S.W. isn’t getting deadly sick of the
Liberal yarn re C. G. Wade’s heroism in
refraining from jobbing himself into the
N.S.W. Chief Justice’s billet, or some ffiher
post for which he was flamingly unfit, it is in-
deed a patient -State. The foolish tale,
despite its venerable age, and other defects,
is still regularly trotted out. Thus, at Rand-
wick, the other night, David Storey, M.L.A.,
said: —
Mr. Wade could have appointed himself Chief
Justice, with a salary of £3500 a year and a safe
pension; he could have appointed himself Agent-
General in London, a Puisne Judge, or to some other
comfortable billet, but he preferred to go on doing
his political duty. There was no need to mention
names, but perhaps those present could think of
other politicians on the opposite side of the House
who would not have let such chances slide.
And the Sydney Evening News had the
humorlessness to head the item, “The Honest
Politician” ! N. S. Wales has had a whole
herd of Attorney-Generals sufficiently well
equipped mentally and legally to hold the
Chief Justice’s job without peril of their
efforts creating a riot among litigants.
Want, Reid, W. B. Dalley, B. R. Wise
and Holman are cases in point. None of
them appears to have dreamed at any time
of using his position to snatch that or any
other highly salaried post. Yet they have
never been beslavered as marvels of virtue
and honesty for it. Two important points
in which C. G. Wade differs from them are
(1) that he does seem to have thought of
taking the big job, and thought fairly hard,
too; and (2) that he was utterly unsuited
for it, or for any similar position. This is
no partisan view of his abilities. At the
time the Liberal leader was understood to
be thinking of taking to the Bench no one
bellowed louder than his own party press.
He was hotly assured that no politician with
a shred of decency would do such a thing. It
was suggested that while he was well enough
as a leader, he would be a public calamity
as a Judge. In fact, his pretensions were
daily torn to pieces, and occasionally kicked
and jumped on as well. It was not honesty
that kept Wade from appointing himself a
Judge, though no one suggests that he is dis-
honest. It was the plain fact that he lacks
the mail-clad hide of some prehistoric jungle
beast, without which as?et he could not have
performed the feat. Another consideration
that probably weighed with him. and, inci-
dentally, prevented.the Supreme Court Bench
being deplorably weakened, was the fact that
no one suspected that the immense Wade
majority in the Assembly would be wiped
out. It was recognised that a certain num-
ber of Tory seats were doomed, but the idea
of a State Labor Government was regarded
by Liberalism in N. S. Wales as unthinkable.
Wade certainly expected that, on his re-
turn from the Coronation festivities, he would
still be Premier. Had he known of the axe
that was Leing sharpened for him by the
electors, he might have summoned up the
nerve to act differently. In any case, the
turgid stuff which speakers of the Storey
brand retail about “honesty” and “nobility”
is the most nauseating sort of cant v The
best that can be said for the Mt. Kembla
one in this connection is that, upon strong
newspaper and other pressure being brought
to bear on him, he decided not to take a posi-
tion in which he would have been a tragic
failure.

Labor Party and Cheap Labor Party.
The Fisher Government has decided, as re-
gards the tariff, to stick to its old, apolo-
getic, non-committal attitude on the rail. A
certain section of the party consists of mere
agents, or flunkeys, of the rich Tory im-
porters, and these persons absolutely hate
any interference with the influx of sweated
labor goods, and colored labor goods and
“scab” labor goods. The votes of these
Cheap Laborites have to be considered. So
the usual excuse is put forward that it is
necessary to wait till an amendment of the
Constitution gives assurance that higher
duties will be accompanied by higher wages.
Which is an interesting streak of pretence,
seeing that the wages are going up all the
time, while the duties are not. Thus the
average wage paid in the factories of the
Commonwealth —men, women, girls and boys
all lumped together—was £77 3s. 4d. per
bead in 1907, while in 1909 (no later figures
for all Australia are available at the
moment) it was £B3 Os. 3d. In 1907 the
average for N.S.W. was £BO 12s. 7d. In
1910 it was £B7 2s. Bd. In 1911 it was
£92 6s. lOd, The average wage of male
workers in N.S.W. jumped from £lO2 9s. 6d.
in 1910 to £lOB Bs. sd. in 1911. Meanwhile,
there is reason to believe that wages in
Britain, which is one of our chief competi-
tors, were absolutely going down for part, at
least, of this period. It is known, for in-
stance, that the average pay of railway em-
ployees in the British Isles —which is pro-
bably something of a criterion —dropped from
255. lOd. per week in 1907 to 255. 9d. in
1910, while the work per man was greatly
increased. The evidence on this latter point
is that there were 15,671 fewer employees in
1910 than in 1907, while there was a vast
increase of traffic to be handled, so the re-
duction was probably equal to a full Is. per
week. Another evidence is the record of
strikes in the United Kingdom, which shows •
as follows for the last four years:—
Number of Days Lost Deorease of
Through St rike. Wages.
1908-9 .. 13,608,175 .. .. £6,670,953
Increase.
1910-11 .. 20,141,931 .. .. £1,953,362
In other words, even in the trades which
fought hardest for better pay and conditions
wages were, at the end of 1911, fully
£4,700,000 per annum less than at the end
of 1907. That is the sort of cheap competi-'
tion which the Australian manufacturer, with
an ever rising wage bill and a stationary
tariff, has to face. He got on fairly well dur-
ing the boom, while the gold output was a
record, and the loans were a record, and
crops were magnificent and sold at high
prices. That is to say, when the community,
feeling really pleased with itself, bought an
extra £lOO worth of goods, the local high-
wage manufacturer got perhaps £lO worth
of the business while the extraneous and
mostly British low wage one got, say, £9O
worth. But the boom is dying and competi-
tion will be more keen presently, and then
it will be a very sudden question of higher
tariff, or lower wages, or the sack on a very
extensive scale. For the present, wages con-
tinue rising, while the tariff remains motion-
less. And the Government keeps up the
pretence that the wage question and the tariff
question are alike hung up pending the ad-
vent of the New Protection. It is a thin
pretence, but it helps to postpone the inevit-
able settlement between the Real Laborites
and the Cheap Laborites of the Labor party.
Different Ways of Seeing Things.
The Vic. Optical Association is asking for
a Bill to prohibit the sale of spectacles by
persons who have had no sort-of education
in the business of catering for defective eye-
sights. What is really required is protec-
tion for the public against half-educated
oculists and utterly unscrupulohs opticians,
as well as the hordes of mere snectacle-
mongers, who put glasses in their shop
windows at bargain prices, along with cheap
watch chains, collar studs and “fancy goods.”
Years ago an eminent oculist from Edin-
boro —Dr. Woolf —lived in Melbourne for
a while and did his best to correct the in-
fluence of rival practitioners towards boom-
ing the sale of expensive glasses. Woolf
advised his adult patients, and parents of
children who were submitted to ins inspec-
tion, that spectacles should be a last resort,
rather than a first aid, in cases of weak eyes
and kinked vision. He likened the child
who is induced to “read easily with glasses’’
when the eyesight is not normal, to the limp-
ing youngster who is hastily put into the
way of walking with crutches, and soon gets
confirmed in the habit. Rival practitioners
had no love for Woolf. He rescued many
adults and saved many kids from the toils
of expensive vendors of glasses, which then-
friends the oculists had prescribed. A
strict Government inquiry into the high-
class eyeglass business would probably reveal
a good few cases of commission paid to
oculists on the sale of specs, which are
specially ordered to be obtained from a par-
ticular optician, price two guineas and up-
wards. And in some of these cases the
patients needed no artificial' aid for their
eyes. The temporarily impaired vision be-
came permanently weakened by indulgence
in strong glasses. It is all right for the
Vic. Optical Association to seek “legislative
enactment prescribing qualifications for ad-
mission to the profession,” but when the
Government is stopping the promiscuous sale
of cheap specs, to careless people of limited
intelligence, thereby providing protection for
the V.0.A., the Government should consider
the possibility of safeguarding patients from
those professors of oculistic science who
would thrust spectacles upon them under
threat of awful consequences if they persist
in using the naked eye. The V.O.A. pro-
poses not to lessen the sale of glasses, but
to monopolise it. The evil of its business
is akin to the evil of the chemists’ business.
Customers are never turned away with the
information that they want nothing. And
behind the opticians and chemists are the
licensed doctors and oculists who also make
more money by their humbug than by their
honestly applied knowledge and valuable
skill. The inducement to humbug is the
same in all cases, and it must remain as
strong as ever, until all professional gents
who prescribe for the real, or imaginary,
ailments of the body politic are paid ser-
vants of the Government, with nothing to
gain from their individual patients save
thanks for purely unselfish advice and treat-
ment.

A Ridiculous Bounty.
Fkom “Sturdy Liberal” :
Last week the Australian Government proposed to
provide a maternity allowance of £5 or thereabouts
in respect of each child born and registered in Aus-
tralia, the idea being to create a boom in the birth-
rate. If I am any judge of human nature the pro-
posed measure will have about as much effect as
though Parliament engaged to lavish on each mother
a shop-worn egg or other negligible boon. Delicacy,
snobbishness, shame, self-consqiousness—call it what
you please—will have the effect of keeping about 75
per cent, of the mothers from claiming the money.
And not one single female will be inspired by the
prospect of the fiver to do that which she would not
have done without any subsidy. The child-bearing
industry is one of those which is got affected by a
direct bonus policy.
A few years ago every Liberal of my acquaintance
was strong on the point that the Laborites stood
for the violation of the marriage tie, and free love.
The thing was an article of dogma, a matter not to
be questioned. Nevertheless, I used sometimes to
ask, diffidently, why they advocated these things,
what their object was, where the plank was to be
found in their platform, and so forth. But no satis-
factory reply was ever forthcoming. I figured it out,
after a while, that, if the Labor leaders were not
mad and were in favor of these things, the aspira-
tions probably arose from the unpeopled condition of
the Commonwealth and a natural desire to see that
perilous state of affairs rectified—since with all their
faults, such of them as I had met never impressed
me as Rakes, or even mere Nuts. Of course there
are innumerable ways in which the population of
Australia could be increased by Act of Parliament ;
and why the Laborites, assuming them to be the
morality-spurners we have always alleged, didn’t
long ago put some of them into practice is a mys-
-1 tery to me.
For example, the Divorce laws in the different
States might be amended so as to make misconduct
on the part of husbands no offence. Many a good,
churchgoing father of a family sternly refrains from
the Mormonistic practices of British kings, such as
he who dowered the Empire with the ducal houses of
Richmond and Gordon, St. Albans, etc. He does
this by reason of the pestiferous enactment which
lays it down that the private citizen Who follows the
Royal lead in matters of the heart must presently
appear before a Judge or jury or both, and have huge
quantities of money, smug respectability, public
esteem, etc., torn off him. Remove this disability
and the effect on the upward leap of the birthrate
statistics would be surprising. Affiliation orders,
breach of promise suits and actions for loss of ser-
vice owing to seduction, all operate to limit the
birthrate. So does the practice, applauded by an
unthinking populace and - subtly encouraged by the
Bench, of fathers, brothers and other strong-armed
relatives taking it out of the vile corpus or hide of
the economical amorist who has declined to marry
the girl upon the worst eventuating. If the Labor-
ites had really been the cynical bursters of the moral
code that it was the fashion to picture them in the
days of the anti-Socialistic campaign, and later, they
might have been expected to attend to these matters.
As a sort of side line, the abortion establishments
which do a roaring trade in every other street of our
big cities account for the loss to the Commonwealth
of more citizens in any one year than all High Com-
missioner Reid’s oratory is capable of diverting here
in a decade. The placing of a good sum on the Esti-
mates, to be used fearlessly and intelligently for the
purpose of nosing out and extirpating abortionists
would do infinitely more good to the birth-rate than
the Fisher Government’s scheme of nationalising
the infant industry. But, above all, if the Laborites
are to live up to the reputation they have been given
thev should get busy on the legal reforms indicated
above. As to the £5 bonus arrangement it is simply
absurd ; as futile as it would be to pay each citizen
Id. per annum for eating his meals.

Affable Alfred, in his pre-sessional speech
at Ballarat (Vic.) last week, skated swiftly
and gracefully round Liberalism’s bogus pol-
icy, like the linguistic artist that he is. He
berated Labor soundly—in a large, vague,
windy fashion —but he carefully refrained
from mentioning what better measures his
crowd had up its sleeve. He favored Protec-
tion, with The Bulletin’s proposal of a
permanent tariff board; but he omitted to
explain the kind of “Protection” _ his party
would maintain with avowed Foreign-traders
like Jo Kook, B. Smith, P. Glynn, W. E.
Johnson. Kelly, Fuller and the like in its
ranks. He clamored for an “immediate, ex-
pansive policy of immigration’’; but he said
no single word as to how it was to be
achieved. And in a matter like this a pint of
detail is worth 14 barrels of eloquent but
non-committal oratory. There are reasons
why the silver-tongued one is particularly
unconvincing on the above topics. In all the
years he has held Federal office, he
made no move to accomolish the things he
now says he wants to do at once. There
was the isame need for a tariff board five
years ago as there is now. Yet Deakin
never mentioned it. A live Federal immigra-
tion policy was just as urgent—yet none of
his Governments brought so much as one poor
little immigrant out. The Northern Terri-
tory might have been far advanced on the
road to settlement had Affable made a
start when he should, and so on. It is just
the same old Affable with the same old
hopeless mob of sluggish supporters.
“Tiie Reefer,” from aloft: —
.One of the stock gags since the tragedy of the
Titanic is that it provided an unforgettable lesson to
shipowners regarding their duty to the travelling
public. Mice! During a heavy fog one morning last
week, the Sydney Ferries’ steamer Kaikai, which
had been delayed owing to the dense obscurity of its
track across the up-and-down-harbor traffic, had
emptied into it at Milson’s Point the contents of two
North Shore passenger trains and a string of tram-
cars. Even when the crowd was packed like per-
pendicular sardines there still arose the monotonous
chant of the deckhand, “thirty on, please.” Gang-
ways, saloons, stairways were wedged with people.
Some clung to the boiler casings. Those who had
seats were in danger of being asphyxiated. Now,
here is where the comparison With the Titanic comes
in. Had the Kaikai been run down in the fog the
passengers would have been crushed or drowned in
one homogeneous mass. Of course, it is understood
that the ferry boats can’t go down owing to their
great, bulkhead system, just as in the case of the
Titanic, but, unfortunately, steamers which are
alleged by their constructors to be unsinkable are
like the trousers alleged by tailors to be indestruc-
tible. When the Kaikai reached Circular Quay a
deputation of scared and indignant passengers inter-
viewed the company’s manager, and was staggered
with the information that on his (the manager's) cal-
culated estimate the boat was 200 short of its certi-
ficated complement. Inquiries elsewhere revealed the
astounding fact that the statement was reasonably
correct. It seems that the Government Inspectors
who allot the number of passengers do so by rule of
thumb, or straight jacket, or something. They multi-
ply the feet of deck area (width by the length), add
four stairways, divide the quotient by seven, subtract
one passenger each for the funnel, the binnacle and
the steering apparatus, and the result is the number
for insertion on the license. Whether this number
can actually be crammed on board is a sort of side
issue. Like the Board of Trade rule for the Titanic’s
boats, which was framed 30 years ago, the quaint
study in arithmetic which is the basis for licensing
Sydney ferry steamers is an heirloom from ancient
times, when it was quite lan event for 100 persons to
make an excursion down the harbor as far as Pinch-
gut. And anybody who desires to ascertain how im-
pressive the lesson of the Titanic has been locally
has only to arise and suggest that no ferryboat shall
be licensed to carry more passengers than it can
accommodate with safety and —yes, dash it! —com-
fort, even if the poor widows who own the shares are
driven into the bankruptcy court.
At last it is proposed to add 225 men to the
inadequate N.S.W. police force, and to raise
the inadequate pay by Is. a day. But even
with this addition (if it arrives), the force
will be very weak. It is customary to com-
pare constables with population, and when it:
is shown that there are about as many police
to each 100,000 people here as in some old
world cities, it is assumed that Sydney and
Melbourne and Adelaide are very fairly
bobbied centres, after all. Unfortunately, the
parallel doesn’t hold good. In a com-
munity like Berlin, where there are
86,000 people to the square mile, there might
be one policeman to 10,000 people, and it
would hardly be possible to call out “murder”
at any hour of the day or night without an
officer approaching with all his might round
the nearest corner inside ,60sec. But where
people don’t live several ill a room, and don’t
dwell in five-storey tenements —where they
spread out for the sake of decent breathing
space—the mileage increases enormously, and
several times as many constables are required
if there is to be a reasonable chance to sur-
prise the fleeting burglar. Besides, the Aus-
tralian cop has hardly time to be a cop. He
has a multitude of things to do, but he
seems to be more a compiler of electoral
rolls than anything else, the theory being
that everybody must be on the roll and that
nobody can be expected to take the trouble
to put himself on. Even the most scarce
and rare constable can’t be expected to be in
more than three places at once. So when the
sandbagged citizen, after he has made a par-
tial recovery, writes to the papers under the
heading “Where Are the Police?” the answer
is simple. Three-fourths of them never ex-
isted, and the other fourth, who is very
badly paid, is in bed, worn out after 12
hours struggle with thick-headed electors.
“Squills,” from his consulting room: —
The scheme of the- Federal Laborites to subsidise
maternity is not new. Mrs. Cheng had the notion
a few thousand years ago, and it has cropped up at
intervals ever since. Bertillon, the Parisian statis-
tician, has warmly supported it/ He points out that
each citizen has three chief duties —to perpetuate
the race, to share in defence, and to contribute to-
national expenses. If one escapes the first obligation
the liability under the other two headings ought to
he augmented. Taxation should, therefore, be ad-
justed, to favor large families, by means of con-
cessions and advantages to the parents. Bearing
children is a personal sacrifice which benefits the
community, and should be treated as we do any
other important public work. Modern women,
moreover, realise their economic value, and natur-
ally expect a fair living-wage for services rendered.
Children are plentiful enough in the Cow districts
because of their pecuniary value to the cocky. Let
the State make all children a source of income to
their parents, and race-suicide will pass peacefully
away. The husband will love, honor and cherish his
wife all the more if she can earn a little money at
her own speciality. The dignity of her position
will be raised, ' and her social status will
go up. The high moral hand has been played too
often, and won’t bluff worth a cent nowadays. We
look after idiots and civil servants, but expect
motherhood, like virtue, to be its own reward. The
craft needs to be popularised and elevated to profes-
sional rank. It is a reproductive work if there ever
was one, and its successful financing should present
no insurmountable difficulties. There need be no
suspicion of upheaving society or bursting the mar-
riage-tie, because family life is and always will be
the key of the situation. Put the sanctity of the
home on a sound commercial basis, and it will be
assured. It is perhaps a proposal lacking somewhat
of ethical loftiness, but we are dealing with an essen-
tially practical matter, and in sketching a policy
realism has impressionism beaten all the way.
Fisher’s bid for one locally-manufactured baby is
£5, not even guineas, the recognised unit in live-
stock transactions! An out-size in teddy-bears or a
slop-shop suit would cost as much. And this lavish
remuneration to a woman occupied for nearly a year
in a dangerous calling! If we had a proper sense of
the fitness of things, a mother found guilty of acc#pt-
ing such a fee would be blacklisted for cutting-rates
and deliberately encouraging cheap labor.
The N.S.W. Sliires are about the acme of
crusted Conservatism; and their last annual
report is a holy record for. impudence. First
of all, they sweepingly condemn the old
political policy known as milking the State
cow, and niously hope that this iniquitous
practice will be put down with a big hand.
While preaching this, they are themselves
the last survivors of the State Cow policy,
for they milk the animal themselves to the
Home to the Sun Lands.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All in a land of ice and snow
The strong white warrior stood,
He heard the mountain tempests blow,
The sea in angry mood
Roared on the frost-bound rocks below
To mock his hardihood.
He shivered in the piercing wind,
He heard his children cry,
His eyes with unshed tears were blind,
His throat was hoarse and dry,
For wrath and darkness seemed to bind
The iron earth and sky.
A lean wolf skulked upon the hill
With utter hunger bold,
Save this the frozen world was still,
And Death’s hand seemed to hold,
Like some harsh blade outstretched to kill,
His sabre of the cold.
The white man dreamt of valleys wide
A-glitter in the sun;
All blue, the happy summer tide
With webs of light was spun,
And the warm breezes at his side
With laughter seemed to run.
There was his home, and there had grown
His forehead broad and fair,
’Mid sunny cornlands overblown
With sweeps of kinder air,
Till Asian blackness seized his throne
And wrought his race despair.
Oh, heavy on his burdened heart
The blind white northland lay ;
Somewhere the dappled dawn could part
The curtains of the day,
And all the merry sunbeams start
To dimple down the bay.
The lifeless land, the frozen night,
Death ’neath a leaden sky !
Better to face the clanging fight
Where war’s red eagles cry,
And fronting wide the golden light
To die as warriors die.
He dreamt his dream, his dream came true ;
The white man’s marching tread
Was heard afar, and foemen knew
His mighty arm to dread ;
Where’er his moving banner flew
The broad, green ways were red.
In strong advance, in grim defeat,
He kept his pain-wrung vow ;
Kings knelt before his judgment seat.
Old crowns were on his brow,
And dark with blood was his retreat
When forced to bend and bow.
And ever from the cold, dark land
In wrath he turned away,
Ever the sword was in his hand,
With eager lust to slay;
His legions marched, his ships were manned
To win the warmer day.
On. on, still on! With flags unfurled,
Fields lost, and battles won,
He follows where the wrecks are hurled,
The path he dare not shun,
The white man's trail across the world
From darkness to the sun.

tune of £300,000 annually. And while they
are holding out their buckets for more fluid,
they, or some of them, are engaged in a con-
spiracy to neglect the main roads through
their areas, in order to throw the mainten-
ance and repair of these back on to the
shoulders of the Works Department. How
some of their endowments are apportioned
Heaven only knows. Cases are extant where
the shires cannot, even after the most des-
perate struggles, spend the whole of their
State endowments. There are many in-
stances, too, where they do not exhaust their
rating powers, yet have thousands thrown
at them by the State milch cow-keeper
While enjoying a broad franchise in State
and Federal matters, they have the hide to
print a protest against any widening of the
municipal franchise, and barrack for the re-
tention of the unjust and insulting “oral
tenancy declaration” which the occupier in
the municipal area must swear to before he
gets a vote. Thus the occupier in the latter
area has to chase a J.P. all over the place to
witness to the fact that he swears he is an
honest man, while the occupier’s honesty in
the shire area over the other side of the
street is taken for granted. The sooner the
Government looks into the whole question of
shire endowment and applies a bit of the
anti-milch cow medicine to some of them, the
better.
The Sky-Scraper and the Shack.
Deau Bulletin, —Somebody arose the other-
day with a proposal to blignt the fair aspect
of Sydney with a sky-scraper of 22 storeys—
the daily papers, of course, spoke of 22
stories, as if they meant 22 lies or narra-
tives. Certain people objected to the gaunt
abomination, and other people got up to de-
nounce these people as antiquated folk and
back numbers, and talked as if the giant
building was one of the necessities of civi-
lisation, and to explain how a com-
munity that didn’t skyscrape was lag-
ging in the Dark Ages. On the whole,
the objectors seem to have reason on
their side. Sydney is certainly in diffi-
culties as regards accommodation. It is
the most populous centre in Australia, and
of late it has been growing faster than any
other centre. Being* partially hemmed in
by water, it can’t expand laterally with the
same freedom as Melbourne or Adelaide,
therefore a demand has arisen that it should
grow upwards. This is a very reasonable
demand, but it is difficult to see why it
should do almost all its upwardness in one
place. Sydney is a combination of narrow
ways and lost opportunities. Even in its
main street, which may be called the main
street of Australia, there are very many build-
lngsoMy two storeys high. There are even
buildings only storey high. These repre-
sent an absurd waste of space; also, in
most cases, they represent old age and mould
an j decay.. When a city outgrows itself,
and there is no longer room to swing the
wild cat by the tail on the Stock
Exchange, and people urgently require more
shop and warehouse and office accommoda-
tion, there is no sense in preserving a thou-
sand or more one- and two-storey shacks,
and building* here and there a towering
anomaly. It is like making a regiment of
six giants and 994 germs. The ’scraper
accentuates the meanness of the stunted
tenements at its feet, and they accentuate its
ung.ainliness. It is so high that it requires
a rnty water supply all to itself to furnish
the requisite pressure, unless the man at the
top doesn t wash ; also, it needs a fire brigade
system all to itself, unless the inhabitants
ot the dozen top-storeys are just to burn.
Une sky-scraper can upset the water supplv
and fire extinguishing resources of a city of
a million peonle, and put them to naught.
Apart from that the thing is ugly. It at-
tracts the lightning. It gets in the way of
the wind. The top of it annoys the feet
ot the angels, and the root of it is in the
road of the Devil. And there is no need for
it except such need as Private Enterprise
muddle has created. A State-owned citv of
Sydney s size, with wide streets and build-
ings rising to a uniform height of, say, seven
storeys, would probablv answer all business
reonirements for another 30 years. If it
didn’t, then the whole business part of the
city could be shoved up to 10 storeys, or a
few more cities could be built. TW e are
points about the latter idea. N.S.W/ has
many good coastal sites, and a skv-scraner.
laid flat on its side, wouldn’t make a bad
commeneement of a new city.—Yours, etc.,

4 he other day The Bulletin told of a dere-
lict, charged in Melbourne with being idle
and disorderly, who explained the rubber
shoes on his. feet, and the bludgeon up his
sleeve by saying that he was afraid of being
stoushed by a pugilistic enemy. The police,
of course, hinted that he was a footpad, and
the magistrate said the suspicion was strong
enough to carry 12 months; yet, when he
appealed, a well-known pug. got into the
box and swore that, on account of a trifling
disagreement, he had already favored the ac-
cused with one walloping, and intended to
repeat the proceeding every time they met.
Whereupon the Court cut the 12 months down
to tour, thinking, presumably, that the furi-
ous walloper might eool a trifle in that time

has finished at Sydney Royal, and on Satur-
day ’Kismet,” of Bagdad, begins. So much
has already been written of the latter piece
.oat it needs no further advertisement.
The revised version of “The Blue Bird,”
entitled ’ Nightbirds,” produced for the first
time in Australia by the Firm, at the Cri-
terion on Saturday, is an improvement on
the story of the two kids looking for a flam-
ing cockatoo. The Nightbird of Happiness
that all the male characters are hilariously
seeking is Girl, and they find it in a fashion-
able watering place in Austria. In Rosa-
linda s boudoir her husband’s friend, Dr.
Beincastler, and a Hungarian serenader seek
it vainly; but in the Arum Lily Club, where
innee Orloffsky is giving a ball, the Bird
is in droves, and in the New Age Prison it is
quite easy to put salt on its tail. It is a
pretty fowl, with fine feathers and shapely
legs. Ihough its color is usually pink, its
language is symbolically blue. It lives on
champagne, comes out at night and never
goes to roost. And like the lyre bird, it
dances divinely. But perhaps the male
species, especially the husband of Rosalinda’,
is more like the lyre bird.
* * *
Count Cliquot’s pursuit of the Nightbird
ot Happiness begins on his last night of
freedom, for at six he is due to go to
gaol for exceeding the speed limit. He is
just the sort of Count tb exceed the speed
limit. His loving wife, Rosalinda, naturally
wants him to spend the last night with her;
but his friend, Dr. Berncastler, persuades
him to visit Prince Orloffsky’s ball and
gambling saloon at the Arum Lily Club Of
course, Berncastler is in love with Rosalinda.
But there is a Hungarian Nightbird who
loves her more Hungariahly. The Count had
made the mistake of thinking that he is due
at prison at 6 a.m. instead of 6 p.m. ; and
wt-P°™ e ’. Co . min} L to inform him that the
W hite Maria is waiting, find the Hungarian
who has just told the bewildered Countess
that he prefers coffee in the morning, in the
husband s dressing-gown. They arrest him
as the Count, but allow him to kiss his wife
good-bye. It is the only series of kisses that
he gets, but they are typically Hungarian.
As always happens in the symbolic drama,
fno Countess goes to the ball in a mask,
rnt Countegs s charming maid also goes.
Ihe only way in which the Countess can pre-
vent her husband turning up at the gaol at
b a.m., and causing the officials undue worry
is to have him arrested on another charge,
bhe notifies the police to make a raid on the
gamblers, and all the nightbirds are carried
off to the New Age Prison. Here the crimi-
nals are treated on humanitarian principles
They wear picturesque costumes, have skilly
and cream, their shaving water is filtered
and a rolling staircase is provided for the
use of comedians. The nobleman, who had
counted the heart-beats of the lady in the
mask, discovers that they synchronise with
those of his wife ; and the Nightbird of Hap-
piness is found safely within the cage of
matrimony.
* * * *
Jack Cannot, as the errant Count, is easy
and unctuous, with a voice fully adequate.
As the Hungarian lovef, W. Talleur An-
drews, as always, acts wijth fervor, and sings
with purity and charm. W. S. Percy, who
has an excuse for the frequent changes of
costume provided for its comedian by a gen-
erous management, sufficiently restrains him-
self from buffoonery to be genuinely humor-
ous. His black eye is the enw of every
pugilist present. It is in music of this
character that Miss Florence Young’s magni-
ficent voice has its legitimate chance, and in
the finales and the Hungarian “czardas ”
sung with characteristic abandon, she is
triumphantly at home. Miss Sybil Arundale
looking charming and cheeky, gives the part
of the maid its full value. Her laughing
song is one of the successes. The ballet
headed by Miss Vivian Talleur, is a delight-
ful reminiscence of the classical style. The
introduction by Miss Sybil Arundale (with
Edmund Sherras), of examples of “the
turkey trot,” “the bunny hug,” and other
American ballroom clinches and animal jiu-
Jitsu grips, explains why the United States
police frown at this latest diversion. If the
management can only subsidise a certificated
Wowser to denounce the exhibition as sub-
versive of public digestion or highly con-
ducive to surf-bathing, the Nightbirds will
not go to roost for many months to come.
Another stage era has ended. The Tivoli
has got another “first part.” It is called
-Night in Cairo,” and the clothes are
different, but the inhabitants lie round like
the vanished “Hiawatha” ladies, who went
before, but happily are not lost. Like the
close of Victoria’s Record Reign, and the
end of the Thirty Years’ War, these moment-
ous happenings induce sorrowful reflections
and set the Oldest Inhabitant’s tongue wag-
ging reminiscently. The acrobatic Hans
i axton troupe helped the patrons to bear
the blow on Saturday evening, and the
whirling- Amaranths bounced and sprang
about as it nothing staggering had happened,
r red .Bluett was another mitigating circum-
stance. Ventriloquist Fred Russell, Blake
and Granby (comedy sketchers), and instru-
mentalist Ronald George filled the other
compartments of the bill.

Margaret Cooper, at the Palace (Syd-
ney), continues to dispense the light and
palatable musical sweetbread with all the
artistry of a finished cook. “Hello, Tu Tu ”
her prize piano trifle, is mere thistledown
from a literary standpoint; but, as Margaret
chirps it, the cheery, casual greeting and the
attached nonsense make a scintillating item
which if repeated nightly with full orches-
tra and chorus, would have all Sydney whis-
tling in a week. But, praise be to Allah!
Margaret has no orchestra and chorus, full
or otherwise.

Camera in the Clouds,” the Spencer
film taken from Hart’s aeroplane, is about
the most interesting moving-picture shown
in Sydney since 1912 was born. As the film
unwinds itself, the theatre seems to glide
along; and if beforehand you’ve had a lob-
ster with suitable dressing, you can enjov
the sensation of flying at the cheapest fee
on record. The most striking part of the
him was taken when the machine was pass-
ing over Hawkesbury Agricultural College.
So tar, cows and horses don’t take kindlv to
the visitor, and whenever the machine heaves
in sight, the animals—they look like insects
hundreds of feet below—don’t stop to argue
but quit the screen. As it will nrobablv be
some time before another aeroplane picture
Happens along, the Lyceum is a good place
to go to while this one is present.

phitheatre, should be of particular interest
to the community. They present a new
dance or leap called the Texas Tommy, and
unless the asylum authorities or some such
meddlesome folks intervene it may shortly
be expected to figure in our Society ball-
rooms, to the greater diversion and edifica-
tion _of those present. Bi-Ber-Ti is still
lllusioning vigorously; Florence Wix is as
charming as ever —in short, the show is
doing well.
“Sinbad the Sailor” still ploughs the main
at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, Pie completed
his outh voyage last week, yet the public
interest in his seamanship remains una-
bated.
“The Blue Bird” is still booming at Ade-
laide Royal, beautifully played by a lot of
people. The children are remarkable, several
of them with trifling parts being apparently
good enough to take Gertie Cremer’s place
any time, if that dashing and intelligent little
Principal Boy ever wants a rest. Of the
seniors, Edward Rigby, as Bread, perhaps
gets most out of his part. Hendrie, as the
Dog, gives a good animal-impersonation,
but whether it is just what Maeterlinck in-
tended is another matter. The whole is a
delightful show —though a minority thinks
quite otherwise. At the Tivoli are the ball-
punching Iveeleys and the musical-clowning
Webbs; also, the dainty Fanny Powers has
some unusually good songs, and Aubrey Mal-
lalieu proves that quiet comedy can go just
as well in a variety house as the old explo-
sive “sketch” misbegotten in America. The
King’s has some powerful singers in the
Jourdane four, but is specially strong in
athletics. The Empire, Wondergraph and
West’s are all relying on intense drama-
films of the melo. order; and Adelaide is
bidden to expect a new house, the “Pav.,”
where one can go in for next-to-nothing, and
stay all day.
** * *
AH the clouds of pessimistic expectation
have vanished from the sky at Her Majes-
ty’s (Melb.). The sun of assured success
pours warm rays upon Quinlan and his
grand opera co. Puccini’s “Girl of the
Golden West,” which revives memories of
Tittell Brune, Kingston and Bryant in the
original drama, was revealed on Tuesday
last week, and will be repeated to-morrow
(Friday). Here is an opera after the own
heart of the moderately musical person who
is contemptuous of Donizetti on the one
hand and rather afraid of Wagner on the
other. “The Girl” is more conversational,
and more detailed in its descriptiveness than
“La Bohdme.” To be impressive, it must
be played, rather than sung, for its full melo-
dramatic worth. The fine, hearty acting of
Jeanne Brola in the name part, John Coates
as the “bad-man” tenor, and Robert Parker
as the lurid Sheriff is more important to the
effect than their admirable singing. Samuel,
as the foremost of_ the crowd of miners, adds
another jewel to his crown of usefulness, and
the alert orchestra is always equal to sudden
emergencies. In “The Girl” there are only
scattered hints of the voluptuous melody
that abounds in “Bohbme” and “Butterfly.”
Compared even with “La Tosca,” the music
is quite harshly laconic, but a strong per-
formance (minus women voices in the chorus)
and the charm of ingenious orchestration
commend the opera to a second or third hear-
ing, though it is not the stuff that wears
for ever. Tullis Voghera was the Italian
gentleman behind the baton when the bar-
maid bounced the “boys.”
Both conductors had an innings at Satur-
day’s matinee, the bill ranging from grave to
giddy. “The Prodigal Sop” is a one-act
opera by Debussy, wherein the modern craze
for avoiding aught that resembles an air is
stretched to the limit of permissible duln^ss.
The story is a perversion of a yarn in Holy
Writ. A fond mother embraces the long-
lost boy before his hairy male parent comes
to forgive him. The villagers gather round
to shake things up, and the incident con-
cludes with a tumult of solemn jubilation
and a forest of uplifted arms. Everybody
holds up two arms as though the Prodigal’s
penitent resolution were being carried unani-
mously. The pure and holy soprano of
Agnes Nicholls rang out beautifully in the
maternal character ; Spencer Thomas played
the Prod, artistically; and Hinckley’s noble
basso was, as usual, marred by a foggy dic-
tion. “Hansel and Gretel,” with Knoch
conducting, followed the sermon to young
men. Musgrove’s German co. of vore intro-
duced Humperdinck’s fairy opera to Aus-
tralia, the voices in that instance being
brighter than the stage management. On
Saturday, the production was quite up to the
Quinlan mark, but the voices of the alleged
children—Misses Beynon and Onelli—had
not much snarkle in them. Moreover, thev
were absurdly big for their childhood, and
their attempts at dancing were as heavy as
the leaden-footed frivols of Quinlan’s ballet
in ordinary. Fortunately, their faces dis-
armed criticism, and of the fresh Onelli
warble, anyhow, one may say that it wants
only another lump of sugar in its fluent
soprano to make it charming. Arthur Wynn
as father Peter, was the best of the others,’
whdst none was inefficient. On Monday the
Valkyrie opera was picturesquely mounted
and smoothly played, but it was very
light in tone and much less forceful than
the work of the German co. On Tuesday
the first Aida of the season was to hap-
pen; to-night (Thursday) brings the onlv
performance of “BohSme,” and on Saturday
the repertoire will add “Carmen” to its
length. Eleven operas in two weeks.
On Friday night “Tristan and Isolde” was
uni oiled for the first Australian time in its
complete form, and the unrolling lasted four
hours. To cope with this work, written
when the composer was fairly feeling his
teet in the new operatic way, the orchestra
has to employ its entire box of tricks, and
only strong.muscular voices can hope to sur-
vive its noisy magnificence. “Immense” is
the only word applicable, to the passionate
scene between the lovers in the second act,

when a tremendous storm rages through the
orchestra, and conductor Knoch grapples
with the elements, while Agnes Nicholls and
John Coates send vocal sky-rockets soaring
ceiling-wards. The more subdued love pas-
sages which follow were beautifully rend-
ered, but an axe might be advantageously
applied to the early portion of the third act.
The large and majestic Agnes Nicholls made
a magnificent Isolde, and John Coates was a
Tristan worthy of the illicit love she be-
stowed on him. The rich-voiced Edna Thorn-
ton was an effective Brangaena. Charles

a pleasing Gilda, but her faulty enunciation
(the ex-Australienne is now quite unaccus-
tomed to singing in English) was in marked
contrast to that of W. J. Samuell, which is
almost perfect. This artist provided an ex-
cellent performance, both vocally and his-
trionically, as the unpopular jester. Barring
a tendency to rumble, Allen Hinckley made
good use of his fine bass as Sparafucile, and
the Dook was taken by F. De Gregorio, a
somewhat husky tenor, who sang his solos
in the Dago tongue, and the rest in some-
thing which at times sounded like English.

“0.K.” makes a just complaint:—
Puccini’s “The Girl of the Golden West” reveals
that ingenious Italian musician in his most purely
commercial mood. Coming immediately after a per-
formance of “Tannhauser,” by the Quinlan opera co.,
the soulless audacity of Puccini is quite staggering,
and its place in the order of Quinlan repertoire pro-
ceedings must have been arranged with that end in
view. “Tannhauser,” when first performed, stood for
all that was uncommercial in Wagner’s musical com-
position, and until his more completely mystical
operas came to light, it stood alone. Even now its'
lofty sentiment seems absurdly “over the odds” to
the ordinary opera-going public that likes to feel
good occasionally, but can’t contrive to feel too good
for this world. “The Girl of the Golden West” is
just a mawkishly artificial ’Murkan melodrama set to
tricky music for the entrapment of the ’Murkan
vote. Puccini was going bald-headed for the dollars
when he devised it. He could have found no real in-
spiration in the sordid theme. The heroine of the
play, as Australia remembers her in Tittell Brune’s
impersonation, is a businesslike barmaid disguised as
“a child of nature.” She promotes the whisky in-
terests of the Polka tavern by forming the customers
into a Bible class and teaching them the story of
Jonah and the Whale between drinks. The ’Murkan
beauty of her character radiates from the allegation
that she has never been kissed, even as the nobility
of the mining campers shows in their reverence for
her lovely innocence. Dick Johnson, the boss robber
of the district, proves his natural nobility by neglect-
ing to rob the bar because he is struck on its guar-
dian angel, after which he goes to sup with her at her
private shanty residence, and accepts the loan of her
bed whilst she prepares to doss on the mat before
the fire. Later on, when her frank fleshly jealousy
has landed Johnson in a tight place, she plays poker
with the sheriff (whose amorously honorable inten-
tions spell villainy), and saves the recipient of her
virgin kiss by secreting three aces and a pair be-
tween her chaste stocking and her artless leg. Fin-
ally, she rescues him from the hangboys’ rope, and
leads him away to love-in-the-mist, leaving the boys
to mourn her loss and rejoice in their magnanimity.
The hollowness of this ’Murkan sentimentalism, this
false creation of virtue in a spurious environment,
this delirium-tremens vision of sweetness and light,
is as obvious as the three big drums in Quinlan’s ad-
mirable orchestra. Womanhood, in Yankeeland, has
not beeri a little bit transcendentalised by local man-
hood’s conspiracy of adulation in literature and social
life. It- has merely .been made shrill, assertive,
gaudily expensive and non-maternal in its town-bred
circles. All the same, the Yanks persist in trying to
persuade themselves that a girl in a mining camp
is a wild flower whose perfume fills the souls of the
“boys” with holy thoughts of home and mother, and
is specially elevating when taken with whisky neat.
Puccini’s treatment of the popular national gag in
its typical dramatic guise accentuates the sentimem
talism, and quite explains the opera’s enthusiastic
reception in Noo Yark.

Jansen, who drew a great multitude to
Melbourne’s Town Barn last Saturday,
afflicts his show with the cardinal sin ot
attenuation. It is long-drawn-out, and con-
tains two or three vaudeville turns that
look like superfluities. Jansen himselr is a
notable performer and a swift man of his
hands. The coins and cards that arrive
from Nowhere seem to transpire with more
than the ordinary element of mystery. Even
as regards the tough old poultry that
emerge from space, there is something un-
wonted in the way they transpire. So also
with the more complex tricks —the “Death
Chamber” and the various cabinet feats.
Where the artist fails is in an immature
sense of showmanship. For one thing, the
raiment of his attendants is reminiscent of
the circus; and if the present writer were
on the bench the farcical jugglery act of
De Hollis and Valora would be fined 7d.
and costs for plagiarism or old age or some-
thing.

To-night (Thursday) is the fourth and
last of “The Virgin Goddess” at Melbourne
Itoyal, nor is that stately tragedy likely to
be revived. The play is poetic in verse and
intensely dramatic. It is not lumbered with
a single incident extraneous to the plot. It
holds people with an artistic grip, but
it doesn’t hold them convinced. The situa-
tions are too strong for the performers, and
the awfulness of the feast of horrors is
never fully realised. In the marble court-
yard before the Temple of Artemis, in
ancient Greece, the local jingoes implore the
King to buck up and fight the invisible rebels
at their gates, whilst he, being a pious
pagan, persists in looking to the Virgin God-
dess to give the kingdom peace. His Queen,
Althea, has ordered a member of the war
party to call the King’s red headed brother
back to Artemis, and, when he arrives, it
seems that the lady has always been longing
for an excuse to take this warrior to her
heart. When her wearisome husband goes
into the Temple to pray, she whispers
brother-in-law to follow him with murderous
intent, and when she would call her lover
back it is too late. The King’s blind
mother prowls around the tragedy, asking
awkward questions. Learning that one son
has killed the other, she bids the survivor
kill himself, but he explains that the coun-
try wants him. A priestess comes from the
Temple with the cheering intelligence that
the Virgin Goddess has decreed the rout of the
rebels, provided Ithat the fratricidal Hephae-
stion shall previously slay before her holy
altar the guilty Queen who urged him to
his crime. Hephaestion swears that he and
his country may be wiped out ere he will
sacrifice Althea, but public dissatisfaction in-
creases in violence until Althea begs her
terrible fancy man to do as the Goddess bids.
She goes into the slaughter-house. Heph.
follows with his father’s sword. News comes
that the rebels have suddenly fled, leaving
Artemis at peace, and Oscar Asche totters
from the Temple to tell his blind mother and
the populace in general that Althea is no
more.
Truly a great “acting play,” suitable only
for a public that desires a long, unbroken
thrill of horror if the actors could impart
the thrill. Melbourne is not likely to rush a
mock-Greek tragedy with two hidden mur-
ders, a mournful blind mother, a gloomy
priestess and a miracle in it. Oscar Asche
is strong, but noisy and essentially un-
Grecian in his gory character. Miss Bray-
ton is also too loudly declamatory until she
comes to her last speech. Miss Wetherell is
overweighted as the blind mother, a fine part
in which Genevieve Ward hit the London
press very hard. Miss Elfrida Clement
speaks the lines of the Virgin priestess,
Grimwood is at his best as the peaceful mon-
arch, and Hignett, with only a little to do,
does it very well. The Greek Chorus leaders
lend dignity and boredom to the tragedy by
chanting their verses with a pause at the
end of each line. On Saturday comes “The
Blue Bird” to the Royal.

Bilanderson chose a moment when the
man in the bar is dogmatising on crops and
rain to revive Jo Smith’s agricultural
drama, “The Bushwoman.” It was well
received at the King’s on Saturday night
by a crowd of urban taxpayers, who actually
applauded a reference to farmer Hayseed as
“the backbone of the country.” Although
its main idea is weak, the rlay is not a bad
one of its class. The dialogue, when not as
good as it should be, is not as bad as it
might be, and in construction “The Bush-
woman” is much better than the worst bel-
low-drammer this writer has seen. The
question that has to be decided is: Who
killed brother Binghi? The hero is alleged
to have done it with his little gun ; but the
Law is prevented from taking its course by
a squad of cadets, who hold a bridge after
the manner of Horatius. Beatrice Hol-
loway, as the charming but apparently use-
less daughter of farmer Brandon, wanders
about the country, in immaculate hunting
costume, saving Herbert Bentley frond
death ; and since Herbert is a mummer of
some excellence, her time cannot be regarded
as wholly wasted. Hilliard Vox, as the vil-
lain, dispenses moving insolence by bush
and farm in the haughty accents of a bloke
who has handed the waiter one-and thrup-
pence, and is telling him to keep the change.
Charles Brown, as a military Hibernian, is
just Brown, with a green brogue. Walter
Dagleish’s impersonation of an Australian
agriculturist of unfurnished mind is modelled
on the comic Yorkshire rustic of 1307 bel-
lowdramas. And Frank Mill’s chanting of
the lines of trooper Glennon makes them
sound like recitative from grand opera. On
Saturday night Miss Eugenie Duggan will
return, like a female Ulysses, from her trav-
els, and will no doubt find her public
as faithful as was Mrs. Penelope. Aided
and abetted by Cyril Macka.v, Anderson’s
newly-acquired leading man, she will intro-
duce to notice “Man’s Enemy,” which is
the bottled foe that he puts in his coat-tail
pocket and sits on in moments of abstrac-
tion.

A film that professed to depict Dante’s
polite insanity of a He'll was uncurled at
the Prahran Lyric (Vic.) last week. It
was a humorous production, crammed with
fat, underdressed supers, posing as the Lost,
and offering snapshots of Charon, the Boat-
man, as an attenuated pro. dressed in wavy
whiskers and walloping the rear portions of
the damned with an oar. A subject of pain-
ful interest to many house-mothers was
“Getting a Hired Girl.” Most house-moth-
ers don’t get her. Here and there one gets
a Tired Girl, but even that is only done by
most unusual luck. i
Dear Bulletin, — The line, in my last
rhyme, “Men of Hell and London East,”
commencing “They’re the wives of coves and
colbers,” should have been, “They’re the
wives of Care and Coppers” (or “Want and
Pennies,” etc). —Yours, jumping wild,
Henry Lawson.
It begins to leak out that Senator Smith,
chairman of the U.S. Senate’s investigation
into the Titanic smash, wasn’t the fool the
world was carefully led to believe. Long
before the rescue boat landed, the wires were
being pulled with the object of either burking
an inquiry, or throwing ridicule on it if it
couldn’t be burked. The inquiry couldn’t
be burked, so Smith was made the principal
victim. For instance, all the world knows
that Smith was an ignorant ass who sug-
gested that passengers might have taken
refuge in the water-tight compartments.
What the world wasn’t allowed to know was
that that was Smith’s bitter sarcasm when
he heard of the scarcity of boats.
The Loyalists of Lilydale (Vic.) (for Loy-
alists in this connection kindly read Hempire
Day blitherers) noticed, with a stab of con-
cern, the other day, that the Union Jack
which flies over the local school, in the place
where the Australian flag should be, was
the worse of wear. In a state of turmoil,
lest England should hear about the occur-
rence, they promptly came together and sub-
scribed the money for a new one. This school
is attended by SO or 90 pupils, yet it has
seating accommodation for only 40. About
50 per cent, of the children perform their
daily tasks seated on kerosene tins and fruit
cases. Yet no one dreamed of suggesting
that there should be a subscription to provide
the kids with civilised seats. Figure this
little episode out, gentle or bloated or infuri-
ated reader, and you arrive at the distinction
between an Australian “Loyalist” and an
Australian.
AT POVERTY POINT.
A man whom most playgoers have had time to for-
get died on Monday at Paddington, Sydney—Moses
Benjamin Barrington, otherwise Harry Benham of the
very early “Mikado” shows. He was a fine actor,
but for one reason or another he threw up the game
in middle life. When he died he was only 55.
“C. Ockney”: Quaint statement by theatrical
magnate Charles To-and-Frohman, who had just
arrived in London from Noo York for the hundred-
and-somethingth time: “‘The Pink Lady’ players are
so happy over the success of this musical comedy
that they have introduced a little novelty. They
step down to the footlights and cheer the audience.”
I wonder this has not been thought of before. There
have been occasions when I have made one of about
60 brave souls to sit out an alleged “musical
comedy” from Washington's land, and any little
kindly feeling shown towards me by the mummers
would have been greatly appreciated. But they never
even offered me my money back, let alone cheered.
After 25 years as a showman in Australasia, Charlie
MacAlahon (of the MacMahon brothers) announces
his early retirement, behind a sufficient pile to dis-
courage the approach of the Official Assignee. “1 ve
handled nearly everything in the game,” sa.vs Charles ;
“opera, pugilists, burlesque, drama, circus, balloon-
ists, comedy, vaudeville and pictures. We put on
the first horse race on the Australian stage, 1 forget
how many years ago. That was in ‘The County
Fair,’ at Sydney Criterion. It was a big job, and
more interesting than running John L. Sullivan at
the Opera House, Melbourne.” Since the flicker
boom commenced, Charles Mac. has been planting
film shows in Maoriland, and, on his banker s word,
the exercise has agreed with him.
“Haresfoot”: G. Anderson, who has been lecturing
in Melbourne on India, is a veteran actor, though
he looks more like a soldier. He was in Sydney
in the generation before last. Then he went to
India, built the Corinthian Theatre, and became a
gold mine of information about all the Thespians
known to Ram Chunder’s keeper, such as Charley
Mathews, Mr. and Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis, Appleton,
Bellew, Potter and Dick Roberts, father of H. R.
“0.K.”: One still hears of imported mummers
making scornful reference to the enunciation or pro-
nunciation of Young Australia on the stage, but to
mv way of hearing there has been a great all-round
improvement of late years in the diction of local
talent. It is noticeable, in the first place, among the
self-taught song-and-patter girls who do a turn at
the music halls. The one-time universal twang and
drawl--the habit of sounding a final “y” as though
it were a double “e” (“pitee” or “citee” for “pity”
or “city”) is the exception rather than the rule with
home-bred sisters in the vaudeville business. On an
average they show more refinement of speech and
manner than imported English serio-chronies. In
amateur theatricals the improvement is just as
marked —on the feminine side of the cast. Many
young men talk almost as crudelee and twangilee as
their predecessors did 20 years ago, but their young
lady friends and accomplices have neither twang nor
drawl. Shockingly vulgar accents are heard in the
very best-dressed female circles, not in the ranks of
the stage-struck bourgeoisie. There the aspiring dam-
sels are careful to speak nicely, whilst their brothers
are left to talk as they please. On the professional
stage the diction of the minor character is vastly
different from what it was when musical comedy
first came into vogue. In those days the “one-line”
parts were cruelly spoken, as a rule. Half a dozen
fine girls, billed as countesses and viscountesses,
would twirl their parasols with haughty nonchalance
and exchange remarks in hard unfeeling tones with
an accent which was common to all. They couldn’t
talk for nuts. Moreover, there was a woeful lack of
diction-culture among the few whose talent had car-
ried them into prominent parts. Rose Musgrove was
about the first to strike the true note of refinement
for Australian artists in polite comedy work. Nowa-
days every girl who gets a good part to play, or a
couple of lines to speak, is “nicely spoken.” Her
tone modulation is more finished than her enuncia-
tion, maybe, but she always speaks prettily, Which is
more than can be said for the male mummer. In
short, the Australian girl has been developing her
artistic sense whilst her brother was devoting his
brains to the analysis of form in football, cricket and
horseracing. What is least coarse and stupid in
dramatic entertainment hereabouts gets the enthusi-
astic support of the women. Anyone dropping casu-
ally into a theatre without knowing what sort of
show to expect (I speak solely of Melbourne from per-
sonal observation) could estimate its value before
the curtain rose by calculating the proportions of the
sexes in the audience. If the girls are 8 to 1 in the
amphitheatre and 2 to 1 elsewhere the show is
“classy.” If there are only three girls to every two
boys throughout the house they have come to gloat
over a commonplace bellowdrama. If the boys
vastly outnumber the girls, and are conspicuously
young, the bellowdrama is atrociously bad. These
are signs of the times. Concert music has always
been dependent on women, mainly, for patronage,
but the fact that the most foolish forms of drama
are kept alive by young men is a quite recent mana-
gerial discovery.
“Stargazer”: I delight in the actor-man’s splendid
capacity for accommodating himself to circumstances.
With the average swell-chested pro. what he is. is
best; and now they that lean on the corners and
slope towards the bar counters are asserting with
due emphasis that acting for the cinematographic
gun is the only True Art. This particular one had a
loaded pint, and was flourishing it bravely, but losing
not one precious fleck of froth. “Your Asches,” said
he, “let ’em pose and strut! Wher-r-r will they, be
in feefty yeears ? Dead, sir! Dust, sir ! Unheard,
unknown ! It ees the ac-tor for the peektures whom
posterity will know and honor. Our work lives after
us, sir. We come as shadows, maybe, but, sir, we
do not go as such. We are for all time; no little
brief hour for us. They want me back on the
stage; they beg of me to return; but no, siree, I am
for posterity. ’Sluck!” And the beer went to its
long home.

To-night and for six nights this week, a photo.-play
of Homer’s, “The Odyssey,” will be presented.—
—Announcement in daily paper.
His praise, by many a camp and pyre
Through Greece was wont to ring—
Blind Homer, father of the lyre,
Who taught the world to sing.
Rome’s sceptre swept across the earth;
The Bard’s fame still waxed free.
Rome died; from out her fall had birth
The Age of Chivalry,
And still the Singer garnered praise
For themes that might not cloy—
Sir Homer, he that trolled the lays
Of knights of Greece and Troy.
Time turns his glass: grim-pleased, within
His snow-white beard he laughs,
Amid the Twentieth-Century din
Of blaring phonographs.
“Who is this Homer?” Piping high
Let young Australia say:

If there were such a tiling as a Pure His-
tory Act in N. S. Wales, the two Sydney
morning papers would be well nigh ruined,
by fines imposed for supplying adulterated,
rotten and utterly worthless historical goods.
Thus, for example, the S. M. Herald last
week :■ —
It is an interesting coincidence that the site of
the naval college bears the name of Captain’s
Point, and it lies on the shores of Jervis Bay, named
after Sir John Jervis, who took the title of Earl of
St. Vincent from the battle of that name, in which
he was Lord Nelson’s chief officer. He was captain
of Nelson’s ship, and in her he earned world-wide
fame.
Same flaws in the above are (1), Earl St.
Vincent was never Nelson’s “chief officer,’’
or the “captain of Nelson’s ship.” He was
made a full admiral in 1795 (that is to sav,
two years before the Battle of St. Vincent),
and was always Nelson’s senior. (2) He
and Nelson were on different ships at the
Battle of St. Vincent. Admiral Sir John
Jervis, as St. Vincent then was, went into
action aboard his flagship, the Victory ; Nel-
;Son, who was' his subordinate, and a mere
■common or garden commodore; was in com-
mand of the Captain. (3) It is not cus-
tomary in the British navy for the mere cap-
tain of a ship to be granted an Earldom on
account of a battle, while his admiral is
severely ignored. This obvious truth, alone,
might'have suggested to the Herald the im-
becility of its statement that Jervis was made
an Earl while subordinate to Nelson, who
never became an earl in all his life. All
Nelson got out of the St. Vincent disturb-
ance was some fame and a K.B. decoration.
The sudden revival of the clamor for
colored labor or cheap white labor in the
Northern Territory has brought many
strange arguments and quaint delusions to
light. This, for instance, is one of Dr.
Arthur’s theories re the unfitness of the
Anglo-Saxon for life in the tropics:—
Does Mr. Easton know that the average mean tem-
perature of Port Darwin is higher than that of Cal-
cutta or of Bombay? And does he know of any Eng-
lish persons living in either of these two cities who
dared to try and rear their children in them if they
could afford to send them to a temperate climate?
This writer begs to reply, as a man who has
clamored for a blanket on a cold night at
the Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay, and
has felt none too warm in Calcutta, and
has been glad to warm himself at a fire in
Delhi, has been frost-bitten at Quetta,
that the doctor is barking up the
wrong tree. Ihe children of white peoph
resident in India are usually sent to Eng-
land to be educated, but not because of the
need to find a temperate climate. Anybody
who considers Calcutta too hot in the sum-
mer can reach a temperate climate inside
two days. Ihe first trouble that strikes the
white man m Bombay or Calcutta is that
the vast native population implies native
curt and native diseases, in which respect
India is quite unlike Northern Australia,
lie doesn t like to have his child brought up
there tor the same reason that Dr. Arthur
wouldn t like liis child to be brought up in
the Cowgate of Edinburgh or amid the back
ways of Mapping in London. Then the
white child reared in India suffers from lack
ot the companionship of his or her kind
beemg that there are only about 100,000
iliitish-born people scattered over the vast
country this is a serious matter. Finally,
the British child, educated in India, is
accursed. Because it can’t be kept in a box
or hencoop, it necessarily associates, more or
less, at a most impressionable age, with
natives and half-castes. To have been
brought up in such society is assumed, bv
the white people with a European education
to be almost equivalent to being a liar, a
tinet and a coward—at least, it implies a
suspicion of all these things. If the locally-
educated man remains in India the blight
clings to him all his life and hinders his
advancemnt. So the Anglo-Indian’s child
goes to England to be educated in order that
may be kept'-'away from that alleged desir-
able fellow subject with whom, some Tories
want to flood Northern Australia. Those
who know that desirable fellow subject have
no illusions about him. But if it was simply
a matter of looking for a cool climate, anyone
can find eternal snow in India, and that is
something that England can’t produce.
“Turbo,” from Melbourne :
Municipal councillors and officials here are rushing
round like a mob of ants who have just found some
thmg to eat. A proper power scheme for Greater
Melbourne is likely to be started by the Government
to supply electric juice to run the suburban trams
and trains. The Melbourne City Council, now making
alluring profits from its electric works, proposes to
spend £140,000 on pulling out and scrapping good
machinery to make room for a 2000-k.w. turbo-
alternator, and to fetch water by a tunnel from the
Yarra, and do many other expensive acts that will
keep electricity as dear in Melbourne as it is now.
Everywhere else steam is dying an easy death, but
the M.C.C. clings to this extravagant means of mak-
ing electricity. Directly the Government power-
house is completed the demknd for the City Council’s
stuff at 4d. to 7d. a unit will shrivel up, and then
there will be more scrapping. Melbourne wants
cheap power, certainly, but this is not the way to
get it. The City Council should go slow till it can
buy electricity from the Government power-house at
Yarraville at, say, 25 units a penny. The same re-
marks apply to the excited attempts being made by
one-horse suburban councils to lay electric tram
tracks up every street and lane where 12 or 13 rate-
payers are gathered together. Why can’t they wait
to see what the Government means to do about the
control of the city’s trams? This chatter about the
municipalities working and owning the public utili-
ties is all right so long as the councils do not create
a dozen or more disjointed undertakings. In this
question cheap power is the most important factor,
and that power must come from a big central sta-
tion, managed by one authority for the benefit of all.

time—he is 52 already—and there isn’t a
in Melbourne with such a hold as the
In. S. Wales and Commercial of Sydney have
in the other capital, and none that makes so
strong a sentimental appeal. Besides, the
seat of Government is in Melbourne, and
that is a strong factor; and so is the rabid
State-frights lunacy of Sydney. The bank
has begun its organising work in small first-
floor offices in Collins-street, but for perman-
ent quarters it lias been offered the fine
Bquitable Life buildings for just about half
ot what they cost. Still, as that would cut

£1,000,000,_ Miller is likely to do some very
hard thinking before he closes his fist on the

The question of what is a place—that dod-
dering Methuselah among legal problems—
was resurrected in Melbourne last week.
One Morgan was discovered running a two-
up school on a narrow tongue of land known
as Galatea Point. Being fined £3O, he ap-
pealed to the Supreme Court, and Judge
Wasley upheld his appeal on the ground
that Galatea Point, being accessible to the
public, who were in no way hindered from
approaching it, was not a room, yard, pad-
dock or what not specially occupied by Mor-
gan for educational purposes, and hence no
Place.” Q.E.D. The State appealed, and
C.J. Griffith, after profound thought and in-
terminable argument, propounded the view
that “a place is anywhere, though many
people exhaust their brains in trying to
prove that it is nowhere.” IJowever, he was
by no means sure on the point, and was still
brooding oyer it at latest advices. Consid-
ering the oceans of argument that have been
wasted over this “place” question, and the
immense amount of time and money fooled
away over it, Parliament might do worse
than state once and for all what it means by
a place. It would be sound economy, for
example, to lay it down in definite language
that a place is anywhere to which a human
being can penetrate, with the solitary excep-
tion of Sheol.
“Melb.”: This city, being still flush of
money, begins to talk over a proposal to
run a tunnel, for wheel traffic, diagonally
under the city, from the Spencer and Flin-
ders streets corner to that of Lonsdale and
Elizabeth streets. Something like this is
needed to ease the wharf traffic. The cost
of the tunnel is estimated at only £lOO,OOO,
or £60,000 for the work, and £40,000 for the
buildings that would have to be sacrificed,
which happen thus far to be comnaratively
few. The hilly surface is all in favor of the
scheme, and the gradient would be slight.
Last week the Blue Funnel liner, As-
canius (10,0U0 tons) wished to come up the

Sir, —I beg the hospitality of your [so-and-so]
paper for the following matter: I am the widow of
a soldier. My age is 44 years and I have three
children (boys), whose ages are respectively 14, 16
and IS years. With the exception of a few shillings
brought in by the eldest, I am their sole support.
Unfortunately, after eight years as cleaner in Post
Office, owing to reduction of staff, I am unem-
ployed. I am of good appearance, strong, willing;
also can produce the highest references. Is there
any kindhearted person who will pay my children’s
and my fare out to your country? We would
willingly repay the money by our labor. I appeal to
you—is there not someone who will save a woman
from practically starvation or the workhouse! Give
me a chance and see how grateful I can be.
(Signed) Mrs. Hodgetts.

Surely it cannot be qther than self-demoralising to
a girl to employ her beauty and accomplishments in
luring giddy men to drink beyond their normal re-
quirements.—Melbourne Age on Barmaids.
When lovely girl and giddy man foregather in a bar
Where counter-lunches, alcohol and flies and cadgers
are;
And lie, though disinclined to soak, is made to by
"* the girl
Until what little brain he has is in a hopeless whirl,
The question is: Is she demoralised in any way ?
We rather think.^o —yet are loath to definitely say.
To state a case in point: Young Brown, a Wowser to
the core,
Drifts in and calls for lemonade—one lemonade, no
more ;
The Maid behind the Pump contrives, by soul-ensnar-
ing grins
And other lures, to force on him a surplusage of gins ;
He reels off blithered hopelessly. Should she feel
grief or shame?
Or rather know the pride of one who wins a tricky
game ?
Or, going further still, suppose the whole establish-
, ment
- With leaping elders, roaring drunk, is riotously pent;
Assume that each of them is blind because she made
him
By ogling him until she’d laid his moral ramparts
low; '
The problem that presents itself is this: Is she
defiled
Or ethically lifted by their evolutions wild ?
Ah, surely girls were never made to play a bloater’s
part,
Creating artificial thirsts, among the warm of heart!
Their little hands- were not designed to squeeze tee-
total paws

“4-7,” from the engine-room:—
It may be, as “Mayne Stay” says (B. 9/5/’l2),
that modern hotel-steamers aren’t being built heavier
in scantling and skin in proportion to their increased
size, but somehow I don’t fancy thicker plating is
the proper cure. I’ve got a memory of a thin-skinned
torpedo-destroyer I saw after it had poked its nose
into another ship’s business and carcase. The
destroyer’s bows were crumpled up like a tin hat-box
that’s been run over by a dray, the edges of the
plates were sticking out like straws from a bundle,
and the stem was twisted and bent round and back
till it was pointing more to stern than for’ard. But
the bulkheads held, and that destroyer came into
port under its own steam, travelling stern first, be-
cause it had no bow left. That may sound a tall
yarn, but there are plenty of torpedo men who could
"tell taller ones about what their craft will stand in
the way of knocks. So it seems to me that the weak
point in the huge liners is in the bulkheads. They
are supposed in emergency to stand as much pressure
as the outside skin,' but they mostly won’t. This
isn’t saying that bulkheads or anything else will
make a" ship “unsinkable” ; in fact, any ship will
sink if the hole is big enough.
Adelaide Public Library lias acquired an
odd souvenir of Pitman’s shorthand inven-
tion. Though written by himself, it is not
the system now in use; in fact, except that
it is known to be a copy of the Epistle to
the Ephesians, nobody can read it. His
niece —daughters of Isaac Pitman’s brother
Jacob, who was a South Aus. pioneer—says
that this was an earlier system, and that
when Isaac had invented his,, own, he delib-
erately forgot the .other fellow’s, seem-
ingly nobody else remembers it. So the
neat script has the sort of historical interest
that attaches to an early flying machine that
never flew.

“Supercargo”: State Socialism is rolling
i s old chariot along slowly, but surely. The
day the steamship Darius left Sydney
harbor for Westralia without a protest from
Willie Smith, Bruce Kelly or other stalwarts
of the old Faiths. Yet it was the first
.steamer run out by any Australian Govern-
ment as a trader (not counting, of course,
the N.S.W. Government’s road-metal carrier,
the Kiama). For years it was in the Indian
trade under Currie and Co.’s flag, and is no
chicken. Still, it should serve the Scadden
Government well as a start in its fight
for the public against Private Enterprise
along the Westralian coast. The present is
the first voyage of the Darius with a white
crew.
GOING ON THE LAND.
“But are there grounds for a divorce ?”
“ My dear girl , six hundred and fifty thousand
acres. Co-respondent is a squat ter."
Melbourne Argus was up against its local
Gaud Mayor last week, on account of his
rashness in referring to Melbourne’s higher
gas rate, and lack of taxi-cab ranks, as com-
pared with Sydney. Holding practically a
brief for the defence of Fat Man’s monopoly,
the Argus was naturally and righteously
indignant with Gaud Mayor Davey for not
being thankful for the Gas Co.’s moderation.
As for the taxi-cab scandal, his profound
foolishness nfisht have moved even a vulgar
Radical journal to howls of derision. Cabs
and cab ranks are under municipal govern-
ment. If the blessed Gaud Mayor wants to
see taxis plying for hire like the ancient cabs
with horses at their heads, he can achieve his
desire at the next Town Council meeting.
Apparently the old horse-cab interest blocks
the way, or anotlierffinancial power prefers
the. existing system” only a few
taxis at enormous profits, and the Gaud
Mayor professes a childlike ignorance of the
truth. All things considered, it served the
worshipful dodo right to haye the organ of
dodoism uttering dispraises to his name.
The Age has decided that the barmaid
must go because "a woman can be much
worse than the worst man behind a taproom
counter, and that just in proportion to her
womanliness and charm.” What does the
Age purpose doing with these dangerous per-
sons after releasing them from the bars?
The female who uses her “womanliness and
charm” to make as much mischief as possi-
ble in a bar is not likely to devote her attrac-
tions to saintly purposes when let loose. The
Age, like the ordinary Wowser, adopts
towards Sin the cheap and easy policy of
shifting it. That is how common moralists
employ themselves —they are sin-shifters,
nothing more. The sin they shift out of one
place presently settles down in another, and
resumes business as at the old site. The bar-
maid who is content to be worse than the
worst man for trade purposes is not likely
to be improved by being compelled to change
her spots.
The Bulletin mentions with regret that
lovely woman has been at it again. A South
Australian farmer’s wife, being alarmed by
a truculent vagrant, fired a gun at him and
shot a calf and three fowls.

“Orient”; A Bendigo man, in company
with Americans, English and other foreign-
ers, lately tried to eat through a Chinese
banquet, only described
as a tiffin, at Shanghai.
There were 15 courses,
eaten with ivory chop-
sticks. First a dish of
nuts, as appetisers. Then
roasted water-melon
seeds, also only by way
of overture. Third, a sub-
stantial boiled chicken,
greasy and cold. Fofirth, a
ham course. Fifth (the com-
pany was on its mettle),
sharks’ fins, the real thing,
dished in thick oil. “Is this the
last?” asked the Bendigonian.
“Last! You’re only begin-
ning.” I-le, of Bendigo, felt
like a fat woman clambering
up about 19 little flights of
stairs to the gallery of the Mel-
bourne Bijou Theatre. On the
wall of the top flight some wag
had scrawled, “Half-way up.”
“Oh-h !” groans the fat woman.
The Shanghai lunch proceeded
(sixthly) with cooked birds’
nests, gathered on sea-rocks.
The shark might be dodged, but
it was a sine qua non to swal-
low .some nest. The amount of
agoAy gone through by whites
in (|hina over this dish is in-
calculable. The Bendigonian
unbuckled his belt, sighed and
dug i chopsticks into the thick
tapioca kind of soup made of
sticks, seaweed, feathers, clay
and goodness knows what. The
chopsticks would insist on pick-
ing up an annoying quantity,
the stuff hanging like macaroni.
He protruded his lips and
touched it. Well, you know, it
was none so dusty—as he says.
“All over now, I suppose,” says
the Bendigonian to a bland and
childlike neighbor. “Oh. dear,
no ! Nine courses yet!” Seventh
course, shrimps and green peas.
Eighth, pigeons’ eggs, with
fried walnuts and preserved
green-gage dressing. Ninth,
boiled chicken and bamboo. This is singularly
uninteresting to eat, but the Chinese seem to
relish it even more than chewing sugar cane.
When a little gong sounded for course ten,
the child-like and bland man said: “Ah,
now you have the very top of the pyramid.
We all reserve a corner for this. It is called
eight precious pudding.” It was composed of
rice, sugar, lotus-seed, dates, cherries, raisins,
a fruit called Dragon Eye, and something else
which the man of Bendigo missed, though
he wrote every course down. Eleventh
course, fried shrimps with sauce. Twelfth,
roast duck and fritters. Thirteenth, mush-
rooms with bamboo sauce. Fourteenth,
shrimps again with bamboo sauce. Fifteenth,
bananas and apples. Hot towels then came
round for oil. grease, etc. “Only a lunch!”
moaned the Bendigonian. “Well. I wouldn’t
like to go in for a dinner. I felt like Wirths’
menagerie, including the hymna.”

The Adelaide Criminal Court has been
looking into a case which might make a
picture drama. Camille and Emily were bar-
maids in the same hotel. Camille “had the
misfortune to be convicted about three years
ago for alleged stealing.” Emily kept rub-
bing it in, telling customers (so it is alleged)
that her companion ought to be behind other
and more numerous bars than that of a
saloon. Then Camille saw the color of port
wine and threw things —tumblers she admits
to, but Emily (who should know, having had
her head cut open) says a sodawater bottle
and a brass-mounted syphon. Sentence of
three months was passed, and exit Camille,
remarking pointedly to Emily as she went:
“You said you would send me back to my old
home —and you have.”

The Barrabool, the last of the original
fleet with which Howard Smith founded the
big shipping business, grounded the other
day on the Fitzroy River (Q.), and ended
its career of movable usefulness. It will
spend its extreme old age as a hulk. Cap-
tain Howard Smith came to Port Phillip ini
1851 as part-owner and commander of the:
paddle-steamer Express, which ran between!
Melbourne and Geelong. In 1862 he went to>
England and purchased the steamer Keif,,
which he re-christened You Yangs, and witlii
which he traded between Sydney and Mel-
bourne, mainly with coal and passengers:.
This he followed up with the Dandenong,
which went down in a gale in 1875, and tine
Macedon. The fifth member of the fleet was
the Barrabool, built at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
and a good old profit-maker for the Smiths
for 38 years.
The astounding parson again. One, of the
Methodist persuasion, named Worrall, who
has just returned to Australia from Fiji, has
been giving his views to the daily papers.
A couple of extracts: —
Whatever motives of personal gain may actuate
the Colonial Sugar Company it is clear to a dispas-
sionate observer that the company is , one of the
mightiest civilising forces at present operating in
1 iji. The company is making more than money, for
it is developing nationhood, ancl in so much as it
does this it calls for eulogy rather than condemna-
tion. To suppress such a company would bring about:
a commercial and, indeed, a moral tragedy.
Beyond all controversy the Indian is the coming:
man of the South Seas. However mean his present:
position may be in Fiji, it is undoubtedly
superior to anything previously possessed by
him in India. As yet only about 40 per cent, of
females are found aniongst the Indian population.
When the sexes are numerically equal the increase
of population will be immense. He is microscopically
frugal, unceasingly industrious, and possesses a men-
tality as keen and ruthless as a sword-blade. His
sense of morality is as flimsy as his drapery, and his
self-confidence is measureless.
So the C.S.R. Co. is flooding Fiji with indi-
viduals wfio have as few morals as clothes,
and is acclaimed by Worrall as a mighty
civilising force, the suppression of which
would be a moral tragedy. It is a queer
theory, even for a parson.
Another hoary convention gone bung! A

THE TIGER REPULSED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To get married seemed the sole aim of some
people. It was not the highest aim in life, although
marriage was a good thing. Marry in haste and
repent in leisure, was a true proverb. Too easy
divorce meant Socialism and free love. — Hysteric ’per-
petrated by a speaker at the Women’s Liberal League
conference.
The presidential shemale, from the presidential chair,
Flung this torrential eloquence across the noisy air:
“The Socialistic Tiger!—he has risen from his lair!
“In his undeceiving, palpable, Utopian disguise
He has sought the halls of wisdom for the choosing
of his prize—-
Quick, sisters! —ere he claims us, let us say our fond
good-byes.
“On his coat repose the fragments' of a much-
exploded hearth ;
In his teeth the sacred heart-ties, confiscated on his
path—
Sisters, let us shield our honor from the Tiger’s fear-
ful wrath.
“He is swift and sleek and shameless. Down his
Socialistic maw
Go the Very Best Traditions, stricken low with wan-
ton paw—
Let ns boil with indignation, lest the Tiger eats us
raw.
“He has feasted very largely on the proletarian set;
For the wicked lower orders most persistently forget
Being eaten by a Tiger is a breach of etiquette.
“He has no predilections for the charming, young
and sweet;
Never lived a saintly spinster but he deemed her
good to eat —
The awful beast’s satiety has never been complete!”
There came a relaxation to the eloquential din,
As the Socialistic Tiger from the highway sauntered
in
And viewed the congregation with a cynic’s leering
grin.
He strode across the temple with a velvet-cushioned
tread.
“I’ll be sorry if I linger,” were the hurried words
he said—-
And then, with one prodigious bound, the frightened
tiger fled !
The presidential shemale, with a fierce, triumphal
stare,
Remarked, “I guess that animal received a proper
scare....
Now, what man is there to face us, when a tiger
wouldn’t dare?”

“Te Babarantiko”: In reply to “Tiaki”
(B. 23/5/’ 12) I can tell him that the stingaree
shakes a prolific tail in all the tropical parts of the
Pacific. Once I banged one of the large ones good and
hard with the end of an oar. The ray doubled with
surprising swiftness, and snapped at and bit the oar
like a dog. Not so many years ago the natives used
the sting—and I have seen some of the barbed hor-
rors nine inches long—as a weapon in intertribal
warfare. A dozen or more “stings were bunched
together, with the points well open, and tied se-
curely to the end of a long pole of cocoanut wood
with suitable frills for ornaments. The b.uncli was
jabbed into the body of an opponent, and with a
scientific twist the ends were broken off at the skin
and left in the body. The sensation is said to be
something unique. A cheerful old savage friend of
mine had experienced the sensation, as well as having
his back split open and some of his ribs cut through
with a yam spade, and couldn’t make up his mind
which he preferred. The flesh of the ray, though
not particularly valued as food, is eaten by the na-
tives. The tail, when dried, is highly valued by
missionaries as an implement of chastisement for
female theological students. Applied with energy
to a bare and securely tied-up female it removes re-
ligious doubts in a remarkable fashion. After the
tenth or twelfth whack the colored lady will believe
anything.
“Te Babarantiko”: Brown brother of the
Central Pacific can go on strike with the best of
them. At Ocean Island and Nauru the vessel that is
to take home the time-expired Kanaka laborers often
arrives a’ couple of weeks or even a month late.
This ensures so much longer use of somewhat skilled
labor. Naturally the nigger, who, ever since his
arrival to do manual labor, has been sorry for him-
self and wished himself home again, resented this.
Some months since, when the usual thing occurred,
the time expired Caroline Islanders (200 or 300)
struck work until the arrival of the steamer, up-
wards of a pair of months' later. The employee co.
had to house and feed them meantime. The last
strike occurred in October, 1911, when practically
THE OBLIGING CABBY.
BROWN (in the preliminary stages of a jag) :
“ No, do’n’ wanna cab. Made a rule (hic)
never lake a cab ’nless I'm drunk."
CABBY: “ Well, I'll go on the rank an’ wait
for yer , sir. Ow long d’yer think ye'll be !"
all the Gilbert and Ellice Island boys downed tools
ostensibly because their working hours were altered,
but really in antagonism to sweating. The whole
crowd of strikers was lumbered, and the ringleaders
sent to the Government prison at Betio, Tarawa.
They hung out for a month, but, finding they would
have to remain in prison until they gave in and after-
wards serve their full contract time, they gradually
capitulated. They say now that no more men will
come to work phosphate, and as coeoanuts are plen-
tiful and a season of abundance will reign for about
four years in the Gilbert Group, they probably
mean what they sav.
“Tiaki”: I enter the “takahe” (Notornis
hochstetteri) as being the rarest and most valuable
bird (from a cash point of view) in Australasia, and,
possibly, in the world. A few eternities or so ago,
when the M.L. main trunk line could have been ex-
tended to New Guinea, and, by making a junction at
Samarai, carried through to Bourke, the takahe, to-
gether with several other northern friends of his,
including the weka (Ocydrumus earli) and the kiwi
(apteryx), got the habit of an annual holiday i-n tne
South. But the gradual disappearance of land, under
Neptune’s scheme of resumption, eventually made the
aerial journey extremely difficult, and it was decided
to permanently settle on the islands now known as
M.L. The inducements were many. There were no
cats or dogs to chivvy the new colony, and there
was plenty of good tucker. The result of these
easy-going conditions was that, in a few ages, the
birds lost the art of flying, and became fowl of the
earth. By-and-bye, however, John Maori brought
the dog along, and, later, the white introduced the
cat and the pig. Then Takahe and co. arose and
cursed the lack of foresight on the part of the early
immigrants. Now there are so few left that, if they
cursed in one maddened chorus, the protest would
pass unrecorded. There have been only four speci-
mens of takahe stuffed for the world's museums.
Two are in the British Museum, one in the Dresden,
and the other (purchased by the M.L. Government
for £300) in the Dunedin Museum. By the way,
the Dresden people got their fowl for £llO.
“Mallarapoonie” : The remarks of “Kobbi
(B. 9/5/’l2) on the rotundity and softness of bottle-
trees recall to mind an incident which happened in
the Territory. Soon after the South African un-
pleasantness had fizzled out we began to see the first
Mauser rifles and pistols in the Far Nor -West. Lx-
aetly why the Mauser, in particular, should have be-
come a fashionable weapon among cattlemen and
others in the Western Territory, of late years, I
can’t say ; unless it is. that a sort of innate flashness
prompted its use. The Mauser, with its great range,
and its small, hard, swift, penetrating nickel bullet,
isn’t considered very suitable for shooting bulls or
such other creatures as a cattleman generally deals
with. The buffalo-hunters of the coastal regions
further north have abandoned the modern long-range
rifle for their purpose in favor of the quaint old
Snider or Martini-Enfleld. Where a Mauser or Lee-
Metford bullet just drills a small, neat hole through
bone and meat and sinew without seriously inconve-
niencing its recipient, the , larger, heavier and softer
Martini missile will leave a terrible trail behind it,
while for a creature to be struck at short range by
the soft-nosed 2oz. projectile of the old French-
pattern Snider is tantamount to being met halfway
by a meteor. Anyway, there was a big bottle-tree
growing near our camp, and my mate was anxious
to try the new Mauser rifle which he had recently
acquired. We had been in the habit of pouring Win-
chester bullets into the fat, gouty-looking stem of
the bottle-tree, which was some Bft. in diameter.
And so regular was the tree’s habit of stopping lead
that we considered it perfectly safe for one of us to
stand behind it, and act as marker while the other
shot. This day, both being anxious to see how the
new-fangled weapon comported itself, we prevailed
on Tarpot, a semi-civilised aboriginal, to act as
marker. As a matter of fact, in consideration of
small nuggets of tobacco, Tarpot had acted as mar-
ker before, and thoroughly understood the .rudiments
of the game. Permitting the nigger a due space of
time in which to become ensconced behind the tar-
get, Bill put up the 400 yd. mark, and fired. Almost
instantaneously a horrified and dishevelled nigger
leapt from behind the tree-bole, and, yelling at the
top of his larynx, began careering wildly on the
landscape. Uncertain as to what had happened,
Bill and I brought up to that bottle-tree at the
double. Then we saw. The hard, high-velocity,
nickel bullet had skipped clean through the tree-
trunk at about the height of a man’s breast from the
ground, and, splattering the blackfellow with bark
and splinters as it issued, had gone right on. So
had the blackfellow. In fact, for aught I know to
the contrary, he may be going yet.
* * * *
“K.N.M.”: “Tiaki’s” question (B.
23/5/’l2), about people who are stung by sting-
rays, induces me to arise and plead guilty. I was
with a survey party at Stradbroke Island (Q.) and
we were frequently obliged ito walk through shallow
' water. One day, while carrying
a level and a few other articles
across a stretch of sea 2ft. 6in.
deep, I stood on 'a huge mass of
slime and pie and wet glue and
arrowroot and live quicksand and
Irish stew and eels and infuriated
soup. The level went overboard,
and a half-drowned cove with a
large and very painful gash in
the calf of the leg crawled
ashore. The cook rendered first
aid with a needle and cotton and
a plentiful supply of balsam, and
seven days later I was back at
work. It is not generally known
that the ’ray will give a book-
maker and a barmaid a week’s
start and beat them at eating out
a bed of oysters. How he opens
them I don’t know, for he has a
very soft mouth. Perhaps he just
sits down and waits. The flaps
of the sthrgray, if boiled for about 45min., are good
food. The rest of him is like eating a chapel.
“Tamumu” : What is the view taken, by
experts on the subject, with regard to the date at
which the moa finally disappeared from the scene?
Was the gigantic fowl extinct before the legendary
canoe, with its cargo of dusky living skeletons,
grounded on the shores of Maoriland, or was it still
alive and kicking? I asked Henare, and this is his
account of the passing of the moa: —
When te Maori he come to Aotea Roa, plenty moa
everywhere. Te Maori he frighten at first but by-
and-bye he no frighten. He keep -te moa in te pa
all te same he keep te en and te poaka now. But no
good te moa. One day he hungry. No kai for te
moa, so he catch te Maori piccaninny and clear out
into te bush with him. Te Maori he never see te
piccaninny gain. After that te moa he think te
Maori piccaninny te good tucker. He tell te other
moa and at night they come into te pa and take all
te piccaninny away. Te Maori he say: “No good te
plurry moa. Bv-and-bye no more Maori if te moa
he eat all te piccaninny.” So te Maori he set te
bush on fire, and he burn up all te moa. No more
moa after that but plenty Maori piccaninny.
Unless I can get something to the contrary it’ll
have to go at that.
THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS.
SHE: “ Well , the Rev. Brown was done to a turn to-day , wasn't he'!"
HE : “ oh , I don’t know. When I remember how my mother used to get these things up -”
(And then the usual row commenced.)
“F.A.T.” writes from Thursday Island:
Can you tender me an explanation of the erratic
movements of tides up this direction ? They don t
carry out their duties in accordance with the sylla-
bus laid down in Mother Seagull’s Syrup magazine,
as I think well-behaved tides should do, but just run
ad lib. A tide- commences to run in and acts sen-
sibly for perhaps an hour. Then it takes a fit into
it 3 head and backs out without fulfilling its mis-
sion, and continues to back out for about two days.
Sometimes it reverses these movements, and oc-
casionally it upsets an old proverb by doing both
things at once. Between here and Prince of W ales
Island I have witnessed a motor-boat going full
speed ahead and yet proceeding backwards, which
showed that the tide at that particular spot was
stronger than the motive power of the boat. Yet
a few yards nearer the shore an empty kerosene tin
floated gaily along at about 10 knots an hour in
the direction the motor-boat wanted to go, but
couldn’t. No one seems to know why these strange
upside-down things happen. I suppose the sea has
a reason concealed somewhere about its clothes for
behaving in this wise; but the most earnest search
in the tail pocket of Neptune has. disclosed no par-
ticulars.
“Mallarapoonie,” from au Asiatic sur-
gery :
Is the camel a beast imbued with a vast magnan-
imity, or what ? Abdul came to my camp, m tne
camel-trodden West, one evening, leading a huge bull
by the nose-string. “Would 1 help him cauterise a
fistula in the camel’s hump?” Me made the great
beast kneel, and I examined the wound, it was a
shocking spectacle : an old saddle sore, as a
soup-plate, which had become gangrenous, and eaten
deeply into the creature’s bank. While we knelt
we trussed the camel with ropes, and then the opera-
tion proceeded with true Oriental simplicity. A
bright boxwood fire was burning close at band, and
Abdul, selecting a well-charred stick, steppeu across
and rooted the live end of it into the camel’s sore.
A scream of pain, a smell of singeing hair, and a
flood of dreadful pus and blood followed this callous
act. Time and again, as each firestiek was extin-
guished in the wound, the turbaned torturer crossed
iind recrossed the little space with others in his hand.
The great beast, like an earthquake of meat, writhed
and quivered on the ground, and the roarings of his
agony could be heard a mile away. He looked as i■,
in the impoteney of his rage, he could have con-
sumed the universe. Finally the supply of nre gave
out, and the wound was cleansed. Some hot ashes
and a little tar were applied, and the beast let up.
Then followed as extraordinary a proceeding as 1
have Witnessed. Standing, with arms extended as
if in supplication, the Afghan made a low, cooing
sound such as one might employ to entice a chilu.
The great grey beast, maddened by torture but a
little while before, and with tears of agony still
streaming down his cheeks, came to the man like a
babe in trouble. Abdul raised his face to the mon-
strous head which towered above him, clicking gent 7
with his tongue. Slowly the great jaws, which could
have taken in the man’s skull, and crushed it like an
eg<>--shell were lowered, until the soft, velvety muzzle
touched the Afghan's cheek, and then lie kisseu it.
<tnd the great beast nuzzled the man’s face with loose,
prehensile lips, forgiving, in his dumb camel way,
the cruelty he had been subjected to.
“Jimmie P.”: One cannot help noticing
how detached some of the back countrymen become.
They grow to be part and parcel of Farther Out,
with mighty little uiterest in the outside world.
Met one away West beyond the dry tail of Milpar-
inka (where one has to crawl under the setting sun
to get any further west, and unless you are smart
the edge of the sun runs you down and squashes
you). He didn’t want to know anything about
Russia and revolution. He would not be bothered
listening to the very latest news; but he insisted
on telling me the full details of the story of how,
three years before, he had “bin up” for hittin’ a
Chineeman, and fined a quid. He conducted himself
in court with such abandon and lack of aplomb
that he Was fined an extra fiver. This was the great
upheaval of his life, and he spent his time after-
wards scanning the horizon for stray travellers to
whom he could recount his story. And he flatly
refused to believe that there was such a place as
Russia.

“Jimmie Pannikin” : In the Sunset Land
the emus are getting- so poor that they are easily
run down by even slow-footed outbackers. When
the pedestrian catches up to the exhausted bird it
sits down flat, being too weak to show fight. Emu
skins are fetching from 7s. to 12s. each in insatiable
Sydney, but the killing of the birds is an evil for
which there should be heavy punishment. What
with drought and bird-murderers some of our most
distinctively Australian fowl will soon be extermin-
ated, unless the law rushes in. An obvious move is.
to levy a penalty of great tonnage on the person who.
exports, sells, offers for sale, or is found in possession
of the fur or feathers of any rare and curious Aus-
tralian animal or bird. I would even pursue the
marauders across the sea, and when the outside of
one of our scarce and picturesque creatures was
offered for sale in Egland, I would require George
Reid to gird up his stomach and run swiftly after
the owner, and find out where he got the goods. If
he won't tell his house should be burgled and his
books overhauled.
THEY ALL LOVE JIM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He isn’t good, he isn't fair,
His manners are not over nice,
For little ones he does not care,
And baths with him are not a vice;
But of the scores of men I see
Most loved and popular is he.
He’s just a common, vulgar type,
With ugly hands and shapeless feet,
A guttural and tanyard pipe,
The habits of a city “beat,”
An eye that rather queerly shifts,
And very scarce of social gifts.
Still men are very fond of him,
They turn down many better blokes.
They flock about and shout for Jim,
And- laugh at all his little jokes.
Yet quite a humble man is he —
Night watchman at a brewer-ie!

Frost-bitten epistle from an Australian
in Wellington (M.L.) :
The weather here never is good so far as I’ve seen,
but lately it’s been beyond the reach of language. When
it isn’t blowing harder than a Wellingtonian does
(and that’s saying a lot) it is raining the roof in,
and the only time it isn’t doing either is when it’s
dong both. And cold —-well, it's the worst I’ve ever
refrigerated in, and I know Scotland under a foot
of snow, Holland when the population takes to skates
on the ice-bound canals, and Russia when they make
a carriage-drive of the river. People here laugh out
loud when I mention the cold, and pretend to wipe
the perspiration off their brows and wonder in
audible asides when the heat wave will pass over.
The rain is enough to make Noah Arkbottom take to
an umbrella and goloshes, and the cold would drive
a Polar bear to drink hot whisky. The Weather
Bureau man has an easy job. He has a set of tickets
printed, and leaves word with the office boy to hand
one per day to the reporter, and then he goes and
sits on the stove. It doesn’t matter which ticket the
boy hands out. They only vary from “Wet and
Cold,” or “Cold and Wet,” to “Windy with §ome
Rain,” or “Rain with Some Wind,” with an oc-
casional “Heavy Gales, Wind and Rain” thrown in.
If I get out of the place alive I’m going to Rotorua
there to boil myself in a hot spring for ten genera-
tions.
‘‘The Wanderer”: Let me assure’“Slip-
rail” (B. 2/5/’l2) that women, particularly amongst
the Germans, do work in the fields in the Mallee.
And apparently the work agrees with them, for I’ll
wager no forest of Saxony ever produced girls of
finer physique than some of the Teuton maidens of
the Victorian North-West. Also, his statement that
“the harvester reigneth alone” is boshmuddle and
piffle and Jonah-whale and Ananias-lie and decayed
cock-a-doodle-doo. In the heavy February rains of last
year thousands of bushels of wheat were lost while
still in the chaff heaps. Likewise, if the place is
as prosperous as he says, how does he account for the
failure this year of two of the largest businesses in
Rainbow, the boss wheat (own of the whole district?
As to his final argument, that the girls are educated
above their station and scorn the neighboring
cookie’s sons, let me answer, “Dogs!” They are
left on Dad’s hands because (thanks to our Lands
Maladministration policy) the neighboring sons have
packed their swags and streaked for Queensland or
Westralia.
“Kinny McCullagh”: In his note on Maria
Island (B. 16/5/’l2) “N. or M.’’Prefers to the legend
of Abel and Maria, which, briefly put, is to the effect
that Abel Tasman and Maria Van Diemen (the sup-
posititious daughter of the Dutch East Indian Gov-
ernor) were madly in love with each other. In
order to ingratiate himself with the old man, Tas-
man went in search of new countries, which he was
fortunate enough to find, and he left imperishable
monuments of his devotion by giving the name of
the lady to many of the geographical features of
Australasia. Flinders, Dr. Lang, Marcus Clarke and
others impljcity believed the yarn, and many roman-
tic maidens in their prime have wept over the touch-
ing love-story of Maria and her sailor. But the late
J. B. Walker, of the Royal Society of Tasmania, who
made a specialty of the early history of the South
Seas, discovered in Holland that Tasman was a mar-
ried man when he set out for Batavia ; further, that
Van Diemen had no daughter; and, lastly, that Tas-
man named the aforesaid geographical features after
the Governor’s wife! Thereby, perhaps, hangs an-
other tale! On the other hand, the lady may have
been fat and ugly and elderly and vain and rich, and
Tasman may have been a deep schemer of the sea
with a hatchet to grind.
WESTERN LIFE.
A drover in charge of travelling sheep fell ill
with fever. 'J'he men wired his wife , who
came along, took charge and finished the trip.
FRIEND’S ADVICE PROVED GOOD.
“My son Robert had colds and croup, and my
daughter Nellie bronchitis, causing me considerable
worry,” says Mrs. E. Cleland, “Actonia,” Bruce-
street, Stanmore, N.S.W. “Mrs. Robinson, of Church-
street, Parramatta, told me to try Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy—said she swore by it, and would not
be without it. One large bottle completely cured
them. Now that I know the merits of Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy, I do not worry about taking my
children to a doctor.”*
“Tekelo” : “Machete” (whom I suspect of
being an ex-A.R.M., or something equally infallible)
envelopes in doubt my statement that I worked a
gang of Orokaiva (my handwriting was no doubt
the cause of it being printed “Orekewa”) boys in
Papua. He asserts that it was “a thing unheard of”
for Northern boys to engage as plantation laborers.
Perhaps it was; but things do alter sometimes. No
doubt the Pyramids were once unheard of. Also,
IN THE COW COUNTRY.
FIRST COCKY: “ Herd's had terrible bad luck , ain't he?
Had a couple of his cows drowned , I hear."
SECOND COCKY: “ ’ Tain't a couple of his cows! It's a couple of his youngsters."
FIRST COCKY : “Oh , is that the rights op it? Wonderful how rumor exaggerates things ,
ain't it?"
“Tekelo’s” death is unheard of, so far. If “Machete”
will grab his pen-name and clear some of the jungle
undergrowth which surrounds a certain Ivanosia es-
tate he will find the graves of nearly 20 Northern
boys who perished in a dysentery epidemic last
year. About 100 Orokaivas were employed on that
estate and the dead ones are there yet. If “Ma-
chete” will not be convinced any other way he can
go and exhume the bodies.
“Fezz”: The recent Abo.-writer who
alleged that the crocodile does not perambulate further
inland than the salt or brackish water can never have
travelled beyond the
limits of salt water
himself. In all the
rivers of N.Q. you
will find the scaly
bloke ranging in
length from 18in. in
the upper reaches
and holes to as many
feet when nearing
the coast. In the
upper reaches of the
rivers the nigs take
no more notice of
him than they would
of George Reid, and
will even bathe with
him. But on the
lower reaches they
avoid him. Person-
ally I don’t trust
him anywhere. Set
out to skin one once
and after making a
cut or two went and
disinfected myself.
Have smelt ' abori-
gines eating him, but never tried it myself. Prefer
old whale.

“X.P.D.”: It is quite true, as stated by
“Wal” 9/5/’l2), that the Papuan seldom kicks
his dog. As a matter of fact, brown brother hardly
ever strikes anything or anybody unless with intent
to kill ; he goes the whole animal or nothing. Once,
on the Mamba River, a dog in the canoe gave offence
to one of the brown sisters, said offence being in-
visible to me. The lady uttered a shout of fury,
grabbed the animal by the hind legs, and bashed its
skull for all she was worth on the gunwale. I re-
member only onC occasion when a Papuan struck
without homicidal intent, but in this case the striker
had merely found the lodger in the wrong bed.
Brown brother won’t kill a pig that was reared with
his children if he can avoid doing so. When pos-
sessed by the lust for pork, he looks about for an-
other gentleman who has similar emotions and a
similar or corresponding hog. Then they swap
swine.
“Snell”: The Dawn was of good stock,
and in unusual circumstances could put up an ex-
traordinary burst of speed, but ordinarily he was
merely a fair cow. Time after time Maloney en-
tered the animal for the Waddy Cup and the
Springs Grand Handicap, in the hope that he would
be moved by some unforeseen development to get up
and really get, but results were always the same.
The Dawn had a hide like a mill boiler. Spur and
whip failed to induce him to listen to reason, until
Maloney, in disgust, put the ungrateful quadruped
to toil by the sweat of his hoofs. One morning,
startled by a pair of battling cats, The Dawn got
away with Maloney and the gig, bolted a mile in
something like an Australian record, and brought
up in a hole in Wilkie’s Creek, filled with slurry
from the Quandong puddlers. Within a few minutes
the horse was up to his barrel in the muck, and
still sinking. Maloney, inspired with a new respect
for his property by reason of the last brilliant dash,
startled the vicinity with shouts for help. Men
came from the Quandong. They jammed fencing
and firewood and tram rails under The Dawn. They
dug and tugged for four hours, but the bog was still a
horse to the good. Then chains were run round the
horse, padded with bagging, and a wood-carter’s
team was hooked, on. Something had to give. After
a long pull and a strong pull, The Dawn came out,
and was hauled high and dry, a muddy and contrite
beast. Three months later Maloney again entered
his fancy for the Waddy Cup, furthermore he backed
the animal for every bean he could gather. Maloney’s
faith in his great failure being regarded as a form
of mental derangement, he found layers of the odds
sufficiently numerous and extremely liberal. In the
early part of the race The Dawn was the same old
laggard, but with about half a mile to go, his
jockey produced two feet of trace chain, and rattled
it in the brute’s ear. That settled it —Maloney’s
horse streaked out, and won by one rod and seven-
eighths of a perch. The owner had found that it
was only necessary to rattle a chain in his beast’s
hearing to get out the best that was in him. In his
fevered mind he was fleeing like Aged Henry from
the horrors of the Quandong slurry.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The grey rain falls persistently ; the sky
Is one despair that weeps upon my heart.
From out their ambush impious things upstart
To taunt me with wry mouths and jeer at me.
The ghouls of doom draw near, with liberty
To prey on the spent body of my dream.
Hell’s portals yawn and gape. 1 see them gleam
And glare, a horror in the closing night.
Amid this murk there is no other light.
To guide me to some hiding-place apart.
From out their ambush impious things upstart.
The grey rain falls persistent from the sky.
MAORI LAND.
FRANK MORTON.
A Minister of Gaiety and Razzle.
“Hello” has a vision :
A recent book frenziedly asks the question: “Is
Home. Buie Rome Rule ?” Well, we have Home
Rule in Australia, and the drab result is Wowser
Rule. Here is a continent caressed by the soft hands
of. the sun, .joyously prodded in the ribs every
minute by burly, jovial breakers, garmented by the
blue of happiness—and over all lies the shadow of
gloom, the trail of the holy snail. Here is a race
emancipated from the fog, revelling in sun-tan, a
race at its glorious Spring, its women Latin in their
instinct for apparel, its men Greek in their love for
sport, a race emancipate, where the girl of 15 is a
grown woman—and is treated as a child, a race just
feeling its manhood thrilling through its veins—and
ruled by the ten dead Commandments and the 10,000
inhibitions of narrow piety. Over our theatres, with
their smug, childish vice, the slime of the Wowser
draggles. The happy nakedness of the modern
dancer is not for us. Our Sunday, too lovely to be
entombed in chapel or church, is still the English
Sunday of purposeless loafing and the distended sto-
mach. No theatres are open on the Wowser's day.
Sunday with us is still the one day of the week
when you take the family and the wife to visit your
mother-in-law, or kneel reverently in the garden and
watch the tomatoes grow. It is the day sacred to
the slipper and the dressing-jacket. It is the day of
rest for the safety-razor. And the last tram and the
last ferry meander home to their moorings some-
where about the time the churches come out.
What use in such a grey-blanketed continent for
a Minister of Grace and Elegance? What is wanted,
first, is a Minister of Gaiety and Razzle, a Minister
invariably on his ear, a Minister whose office hours
start at midnight, and who never goes to sleep at all.
The first job for the Minister of Razzle would be
the demolishing of a hundred shops—there are too
many shops, anyway—and the installation on
their razed foundations of cafds, with green
trees in green tubs, multitudes of little white-
covered tables and chairs on a sanded floor, and a
battery of bocks and long green drinks in long green
glasses. There Sydney could sit and dine and sup
and watch the gay crowds saunter by. At
dusk all traffic would be stopped in Martin
Place and at Circular Quay. The whole vacant areas
would be set out with tiny tables and pretty wait-
resses, and the Tourist Department in Martin Place
and the warehouse of Goldsborough Mort at the
Quay would be turned into brasseries. And on the
steps of the Post Office Australian music-hall per-
formers would pirouette and warble Australian poems.
And on the flat roof of every great building would
be a grove of palms, beneath which Sydney citizens
would sit and sip and watch, as far as their atten-
tion was permitted to wander from the multitude of
Girl, the performance of the latest Australian play,
the curtain of which would rise at 12 p.m., and never
come down at all. And the Minister of Gaiety and
Jim-Jam, in his embroidered aeroplane, would make
his nightly rounds, alighting here for a draught
of wine and there to dance a joyous can-can with
the Presidentess of the Woman’s Liberal Terpsichorian
League, all glasses broken being paid for by the de-
partment.
This would be, however, merely routine work. The
Minister’s great chance would come at Carnival time,
when all Sydney would give itself up to revelry;
every citizen not in disguise would be arrested ; the
students of the Art Societies would hold masquerade
balls, from which anybody with too much clothing on
would be chucked out; and there would be a Battle
of Wattle Flowers in Centennial Park !
And every hotel would be closed, and every caff
open all the night, or, in fact, as long as anybody
was awake. And no trams would be allowed to start
for the suburbs till 3 a.m. And every Wowser would
be transported to Paris.
And altars would be set up to Pan at Manly and
Cronulla, and a shipload of assorted Greek nymphs
be imported, and fountains of nectar set up at every
street corner, and the music-halls would fee inusie-
Dulls —not dull theatres, and the Comic Australian
would be Comic, which it couldn’t be. And within
a year there would be nobody left in Europe except
Wowsers.
♦
The Suspicious Anxiety of the Grog
Pusher.
THIS is the plaint of “Mynsa Pinte”
The proposal of the Melbourne grog retailers to do
away from the counter-lunch has led to the publication
of a lot of ill-considered remarks. The heartrending
account of the loss occasioned to Bung by his giv-
ing away the dead ends of loaves and joints from
the dining-room affects me deeply. The one diffi-
culty that confronts me is to discover the gener-
osity. I, myself, am a counter luncher, not be-
cause I am enamored of the lunch, or even the
counter. But a sandwich and a glass of beer are
better than the haughty indifference of the gold-
fanged waitress in the restaurant, even if she is
handing round roast duck and wines. In return
for the beer I pay Bung 6d., and 1 eat perhaps two
slices of bread and one slice of meat. Butter and
a lettuce leaf would not bring the cost of the food
to a penny, while the beer would most certainly not
cost the penurious publican 2d. And the bulk Of
the counter-lunchers drink beer, and eat no more
than my miserable self.
Of course, there are other charges against the
goods supplied, but the final cost in a house doing
a reasonable business is out of all proportion to the
profit. In fact, it is something like a terrier leap-
ing madly in the direction of the whiskers of a large
and prosperous dromedary. Anybody who desires
full illumination on this point can obtain it by
entering into negotiations for the purchase or lease of
a going concern with a city license. The fact of the
matters appears to be that Bung, who is notorious for
his sordid instincts, has become alive to the fact
that his is about the only monopoly that is not
making an extra dip into the increasing wages of
Australians. He cannot easily charge more money
for his liquor, so the counter-lunch appeals to him
as a means of getting a look-in somewhere. In
most cases he would be making one of those blun-
dering, ignorant moves for which the Trade is
famed. But that is hardly worth mentioning. One
does not look for an undue amount of intelligence
amongst a crowd whose callous grab for the last
cent is driving the general community in rapidly
increasing numbers behind the forces of Vinegardom.
Perhaps the most hilarious part of the move to
withdraw the counter-lunch was the stated anxiety
of Bung and Hoops as to the health of his cus-
tomers. The danger, they said, of scoffing food
that had been begermed by the touch of a diseased
browser, was awful! Nothing could be more
magnificent or less convincing. The same Bung
and Hoops often won’t even wash their glasses.
In very many hotels in Sydney, for instance, a glass
or pewter, after being used, is merely slushed into
a sink of. water—often filthy—flicked out, and dried
on a towel that a man in his private home wouldn’t
use to polish his dog, let alone his boots. Not long
ago W. G. McClure, M.D., published a protest
in Sydney, as follows: —
“There is a very real, substantial source of con-
tagion that is allowed by our Health authorities to
exist and persist without let or hindrance. I refer
to the exceedingly faulty, practice in many wine
saloons, restaurants, and even high-class hotels, of
rinsing glasses, mugs and cups in a tank, tub or
bucket of water in which countless other glasses,
mugs and cups have been dipped. The water may
or mav not be changed occasionally during the day ;
that depends largely on whether the bar-tender has
a conscience, and any leisure. .. .Persons suffering
from various contagious diseases frequent public
drinking nlaces. The glass or cup used by them, and
very inadequately cleansed, is handed to the next
comer, and so disease is disseminated.”
But to instal the antiseptic cleansing plan would
cost each Bung a pound or two, consequently the
unanimous silence concernng the danger to cus-
tomers in the. drinking direction leads one to the
brink of suspicion. And when a person hears the
frenzied shouts of Boniface, in favor of abolishing
the counter-lunch for hygienic reasons, then a person
takes a header into the depths of a dead certainty.

A nigger who blasphemed in the dock at
Sydney Water Bobby Court one day last
week, and called the magistrate “cocky, me
boy”—not “old rooster” or “cockolorum,”
but simply “cocky, me boy”—kept the law
busy for a half hour. When tlie dust of
battle had cleared away, the'bill was £5 or
two months for language (including “cocky”)
in court; £5 or two months for language
(much worse than “cocky”) in the Domain;
10s. or seven days for wrecking a padded
cell, and to pay for the damage done to the
cell; six months for battering a policeman,
six months for battering a second policeman;
and remanded for biting a third policeman.
By this time, the nigger could hardly be
seen for language.
THE SPY OF THE FUTURE.
The latest idea is the training of eagles to attack
airships, dirigibles, etc., by affixing pieces of raw
meat to the envelope.
Old Benjamin Short, who died in Sydney
the other day, was the only man who ever
got a seat on the Board of the A.M.P. with-
out being on the office ticket. Present-chair-
man Meeks and ex-director R. J. King were
the official pair in 1892 ; but the poll ran out
this way; Meeks, 34,327; Short, 29,611;
King, 27,383; and half a dozen others no-
where. Short's disability was that he had
been merely one of the society’s canvassers.
But he was so good at the game that he per-
sonally roped in 12,000 policies, and that and
the fact that he was known to practically
every agent in the service enabled him to do
a trick accomplished by no other man before
or since. In his early days Benjamin was a
blacksmith; in his latter days he was chiefly
an unpaid parson of the useful city-mission-
ary brand.

Joe YVard, who is being angled for by the
Commonwealth Liberal crowd in Victoria, is
a native of Melbourne. He was born on
Emerald Hill in 1857, and was taken to
Maoriland when ne was too young to have a
say in the matter. In 1870 be put on a tele-
graph messenger’s cap, but in three years be
gave that strenuous job best, and turned bis
attention to business, etc. Emerald Hill, on
wliich be was born, is now a part of South
Melbourne. Edmund Finn (“Garryowen”)
gave the place its original name.
Lord Deerhurst, who is best remembered
to Australians as the hero of a scrimmage in
Aviv! 3ar Gallagher’s Hotel, Bourke-street,
Melbourne, seems now to be a person of some
importance in England. He has been ad-
dressing the ‘‘Grand Lodge of the National
Conservative League.” Here’s a eem from
ms oratory on the occasion: “This con-
tounded Irish-Radical-Socialist Government
is legislating solely with a view to keeping
themselves in power, and they don’t care a
damn about the interests of the country.”
* jondon lately W. E. Smith, of
the big Sydney printery, and described as
tlie rounder or the business with which he
was connected for 40 years.” Smith, as a
matter of fact, only came in after one
Dennis had had his shingle hung out for
some years. The man who died the other day
hrst joined the firm as a traveller; and he
pushed and he pushed until the shingle said
Dennis and Smith.” Then there was a
sensational two years’ fight in the law courts
between the partners ; but once more Smith
pushed hardest, and Dennis dropped right
out.
Died, at Parramatta (N.S.W.), June 13,
Joseph Louglilin Ahern, Monsignor of the
K.C. hierarchy, an Irishman, aged 64. He
came from the U.S. to Australia nearly 30
years ago, and was a foremost theologian
at the first Plenary Council held in Sydney
in August, 1885. Most of the intervening
•Ff s he spent on the Northern Rivers
(JN.S.W.). In his heyday he enjoyed some
lame, both as an orator and as a musician,
but most of all he shone as an after-
dinner speaker, though lie could do far better
than most people before the time came for
the speeches.
One of those cases which makes the lives
the Bar less miserable came before
N.S.W. Equity Court recently, when the
trustees of the estate of the late James
Rutherford sued the legatees in a friendly
way to determine certain clauses in the will.
Testator was a Bathurst (N;S,W.) squatter
and it took nine eminent horsetails to ex-
plain to. another. exalted equine queue what
was fairly obvious from the beginning.
Costs came out of the estate, as they did in
the case of Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, and the
estate was worth £450,000.
Bill Jones, who Premiered Maoriland for
46 days because King Seddon was dead and
Ward wasn’t there to seize the crown, lias
resigned his High Commissioner’s position in
London. From time to time his term of
office has been extended in a way far from
satisfactory to William. Latterly, when the
Government took to re-appointing him from
month to month he began to suspect that he
was being used as a mere, old threadbare
stop-gap until his would-be successors had
finished quarrelling over his bones. So the
man who threatened to see George V. (then
Duke of York) blowed before he would give
him his suite of rooms at a Wellington
(M.L.) pub, dropped his tools and cabled
Premier Mackenzie that he had left the
office in charge of Martha Washington, the
lady who cleaned up. It was the boundless
upheaval of Jones. The old man returns to
spend his last years in Maoriland.
The railway smash of two years ago was
indirectly responsible for another death only
last week. Carew Reynell, business repre-
sentative of the S. M. Herald in Mel-
bourne, died of uraemic poisoning, after he
had battled against a sharp attack of pneu-
monia. An old kidney trouble developed in
serious form, as the result of the shock he
got in Victoria’s last big railway' sensation.
He Was one of those who were thought
lucky to have escaped “without the least
injury.” But from that time he began to
ail, and he never left off ailing till he passed
out. Carew Reynell became a Collins-street
identity during his 10 years of residence in
Melbourne, and his aggressively hearty style
and genial self-sufficiency had endeared him
to many men. He held his hand out further
m front of him when he met a friend than
any other man of his size in the State, and
he shook even the fin of a casual acquaint-
ance in a way that made a breeze.
H. I. Jensen, mentioned as probable Com-
monwealth Geologist for the Territory, has
a record which even the most disgruntled
can’t throw a rock at. He is quoted
in. Europe as among the foremost
scientific rock-breakers of the day. Jen-
sen was born in Copenhagen, and came
to Australia when he was agpd three. His
mother was the daughter of Ingemann, the
Danish poet. His university career was one
of astounding brilliancy. He won his D.Sc.
entirely on bursaries, secured the David
Svme prize for original research work in
science, and held the Macleay fellowship of
£3OO a year given by the Linnsean Society
until he conceived the humanitarian idea
that someone else might want the cash more
than he did. At the age of 18 he- shared
with Bernard Ingleby the distinction of being
the first, to winter on the ton of Kosciusko.
He .founded in Sydney the first University
Socialist Society, and found that his views
wpre of precious little material benefit to
him. He also worked for six months for
the C.S.R., and has no specially high regard
for the concern. At present, lie is emnloved
in chemical research work by the N.S.W.
State Government.
The heir of the Earl of Ranfurly, ex-
Governor of Maoriland, has secured one of
the wealthy Cooper-baronet girls. The orig-
inal baronet, Dan, married an Australian
native, Betty Hill. Betty was a daughter
of William Hill, and sister of George Hill,
whose daughter married William Charles
Cooper, the present (third) baronet, son of
Dan, the first baronet. The second bart., Dan
also, married a daughter of baronet James
Grant-Suttie, of Haddingtonshire. They only
had girls ; hence William Charles, the second
bart.’s brother, succeeded to the gaud. This
present bart.’s godfather was William
Charles Wentworth. It is one of the second
Daniel’s girls who has married the heir of
Ranfurly.
Norwood, a suburban corporation of Ade-
laide, has conferred its “freedom” —after the
English silliness —on the veteran brewer, E.
I. Smith, who has spent all his days, and
made most of his money, within its boun-
daries. Edwin Smith has always been an
all-round man ; and sporting, religious, phil-
anthropic, financial, political and municipal
bodies all sent speakers to tell the old gentle-
man that he was a jolly good fellow. After
which Smith (who is 82) spoke for 45
minutes without a note. His record includes
five terms as Mayor of Adelaide and five of
Norwood, over 30 year’s in Parliament, and
the presidency of 50 things, from the Savings
Bank and National Park to the local tennis
club. A born worker, he was very largely
responsible for the tramways, the Adelaide
deep drainage system (over 30 years back),
the Jubilee Exhibition and the lake which
was scooped out of the Torrens at the back of
I arliament House.

It is too late for
Stead to sack his
spooks now; but
they played him a
dirty trick for all
that. According to
the London Daily
Mail :
Stead, last October,
in Const a ntinople,
prophesied his own
death. “I know per-
fectly well how I shall
die. I shall go to pri-
son twice more before
I die, and shall end
by being kicked to
death in the streets of
London. This makes
my mind quite easy
when I travel, and I
never insure myself
against risks of any
kind.”
On the whole, the
safest thing seems
to be, if you must
have a spook, to
have one that is in
the insurance busi-
ness, and has to
rely on commis-
sions for a living.
Lnderstood that Acting Justice Rich will
be permanently appointed to the N.S.W.
Supreme Court Bench on July 2.
Thomas Tait, of Sunshine and Richmond,
is proposed as president of 'the Canadian
Grand Trunk line, President Hays being at
the sea-bottom with the Titanic lying on his
chest, . When Tait fled from Victoria after
the Richmond trouble, it was understood
that he wasn’t bolting from his handiwork,
but was retiring to spend the rest of his
days in ease. The situation looks somewhat
different how. His father was Melbourne
Tait, of Montreal, Chief Justice of Quebec,
and the family has a big pull in the land
with the worst railway smash record on
earth.
Minahan, Labor M.L.A. tor Belmore
(N.S.W.), gives away the whole of his Par-
liamentary allowance per medium of the
local St. Vincent de Paul’s Society. Be-
sides, he is said to be “willing” for all
the other preposterous claims the public
makes on its member, so that for the distinc-
tion of representing Belmore he has to pay
probably £6 or £8 per week. The last mem-
ber to try this expensive method was poor
old Edward Terry, of Eastwood, and he
didn’t find it much of a success. Electors
mostly seem to agree with Josh Billings
when he said that a man who works for
nothing earns his wages. The same prob-
ably applies to the man who works for less
than nothing.
When the late W. A. Zeal’s Tory pals
talked about the corrupting influence of pay-
ment of members, the little red ex-President
of the Council mostly held his tongue. After
having a shot at digging and storekeeping.
Zeal joined the “service” under Andrew
Clarke, tSurye.vor-General in the ’so’s. Rail-
way lines from Melbourne to Bacchus Marsh
and Bungaree, and thence to Yandoit and
Castlemaine were proposed and prepared for,
but the'log-rollers got to work ahead of the
railway makers, and other lines were substi-
tuted, including one to Sandhurst via Ivyne-
ton and Castlemaine and another to Ballarat
via Geelong. Zeal’s own idea was that the
change of intention cost the Government
±3,060,000, and, remembering that little busi-
ness, he had an idea that politics hadn’t got
much worse in half a century.
Solomon, the new stop-gap Premier in
Tasmania, doesn’t belong to the tribe of
Judah. In fact, he is so utterly remote from
the tribe that, besides being a barrister, he is
a Methody local preacher, and is generally to
be found on the Wowser ticket.
THE BREAKING OF THE DROUGHT.
W. McDonough, who found Mt. Lyell and
helped his brother to put the first shots into
the great mine, has just died in the Hobart
Hospital. He and a party were out after
gold when he climbed the knob. Like many
another prospector, he didn’t know what he
had stumbled on, and, though the* party
pegged a prospecting area, he sold out for a
trifle, lie spent his last years as a pensioner
of the State and the Lyell Co.
Another Hebrew makes a record. Rufus
Isaacs is the first British Attorney-General
to be given a seat in the Cabinet. Before he
went to the Bar he was on the Stock Ex-
change ; and, though he has a winning way
with him when he addresses a jury or cross-
examines a lady in the Divorce Court, he is
in his real element when dealing with some
complex share-dealing case. It was he who
tied Whittaker Wright up in a knot in the
trial which resulted in that Unhappy finan-
cier receiving seven years’ penal servitude
and incidentally poisoning himself. Later
he had the ticklish job of dealing with
the Ring s libel case. George V. wanted to
go into the witness box and swear that he
had never married the Admiral’s daughter,
but Ike wouldn’t have it. During the past
year his chief occupation has been helping to
settle strikes and playing golf with Lloyd
George and the Master of Elibank at Cannes.
An uncle of Rufus’s was Sir Henry Isaacs,
at one time Mayor of London: and Alfred
Sutro, the dramatist, is his brother-in-law.
The Second-oldest Inhabitant calls for
order:—
F. C. Mason, a long-ago Victorian Speaker, who
might have been Speaker still if his Gippslantl con-
stituents hadn’t sacked him, has got the belated and
cold comfort of being an “Honorable” for evef. The
Speakers at Melbourne have included Beazley, Bent,
Berry, Davies, Duffy, Gillies, Lalor, McMahon, Mad-
den, Mason and Murphy. Four M’s, three B’s, two
D’s a cricket eleven, with a run on three letters for
nine of them. The first was Murphy; then McMahon,
and that was a bitter disappointment for Duffy, who,
Tom Quinlan, of
the opera company.
however, got in
later. Duffy always
prided himself on
having had the ad-
vantage of a train-
ing in the British
Parliament. This led
to a punctilio, like
that of his friend
Bishop Corbett over
the Rubrics*. In spite
of Duffy’s English
experience, Eureka
Lalor was reckoned
the best Speaker of
all. Captain McMa-
hon had been Chief
Police Commissioner,
preceding Standish,
Nicholson, Chomley
and O’Callaghan
Bent was regarded
as gone for ever when
he lost the Speaker-
ship, which he only
obtained by a fluke :
yet another fluke
gave him four years
Premiership. Berry,
like Mason, was
crushed out by his
electorate, and was
pensioned with £5OO
a year. Beazley, a
highly qualified man,
only got a whiff, be-
cause he was a La-
borite. As a Speaker,
Mason was just or-
dinary ; but as
Charles the First he
was the best figure
in one of the fancy
balls.
Vanished from the S.A. railways, Walter
Rutt, Chief Engineer, who has to go, being
70. He is a Londoner by birth, and has
been in Australia since 1869. One of his
first bits of work was under the late Charles
Todd in putting up the Northern Territory
section of the transcontinental telegraph line.
Ilis deputy, who will presumably succeed
him, is J. C. B. Moncrieff, already 63 years
old, and an active Australian since 1875.
His brother, Alex. Moncrieff, is the State’s
Railway Commissioner.
NOT FEELING TOO GOOD.
“I was not feeling too good for months, and being
a sufferer from constipation I tried Chamberlain’a
Tablets and found them really splendid,” writes Mr.
Arthur Bradbury, Provision Merchant, 40 Smith-
street, Collingwood, Vic. “They certainly made me
feel good after I had taken a few doses. Chamber-
lain’s Tablets are the best medicine I have ever used.
I often take a dose, and would not be without
them.”*
A TRAGEDY OF PARIS HATS AND CREAM
PUFFS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The ex-Prime Minister, when his turn came to
speak, remarked on the forlorn position in which he
felt himself, with one solitary male supporter in
such a gathering. With his back to the wall, how-
ever, and with the top of his head showing over some
score of matinee hats, he managed to deliver a grace-
ful speech that was much applauded.
—Report of “Liberal” cream puff function.
To say that those Liberals who have their hands on
the pulse of the electorates in this State are bitterly
disappointed with the policy drawn up by the recent
inter-State conference is to put it mildly. “As com-
pared to what it might be,” remarked a prominent
Liberal this morning, “this policy has the same pro-
portion as a pea has to a pumpkin;” while another
member of the party sums it up as attitudinarian,
latitudinarian and platitudinarian. —News item.
The time was when dear Alfred led his country’s
cheering van,
And with his silver tongue enthused all honest
democrats;
But nowadays our Alfred is a sadly altered man,
Whose ruffled hair alone is seen above the Paris
hats ;
Resistless torrents of weak tea have swept him from
his place;
Ten thousand tons of half-baked scones have fallen
on his crown ;
We hear him chiming faintly still, but cannot see his
face;
He tinkles very weakly like a clock that’s running
down.
One man goes down to ruin with a sudden, startling
roar,
And o’er the awful, streaming brink shocked mil-
lions dare not look;
Another drowns in Paris hats upon a polished floor,
Or slowly starves to death upon the follies of a
Cook ;
Cream pulls and sandwiches, jam roll and cups of
lukewarm tea —-
This food is good enough for Hats both “heavenly”
and “sweet” ;
But Boxers need some stronger fare, and Soft Felts
will not be
Put off with things that don’t contain a trace of
honest meat.

When Denison Miller, of the new Commonwealth
Bank, reads the B.N.Z.’s report he will feel better;
and he needs to feel good for the job he has ahead of
him. This B.N.Z. was so utterly broke in 1894 that
it looked in on the Premier of Maoriland one after-
noon and said there was going to be a smash next
day if the State didn’t put up £1,000,000. That
smash would have hurt the State terribly, so the
£1,000,000 was put up, and another £1,000,000 fol-
lowed it, and then £500,000 followed that —the last
lot in terminable pref. shares. In 1903, after 10
years of successful struggle, the bank had got into a
position to make a new arrangement. The £500,000
of terminable share capital had been repaid a few
years previously; now the State consented to let
£1,000,000 remain with the bank for another 10
years provided that the bank issued to the State at
par £500,000 in permanent pref. shares. That
arrangement was completed, and so matters stand to-
day ; there are 150,000 ordinary shares of £6 13s. 4d.,
paid to £3 6s. Bd., £500,000 pref. capital, and
£1,000,000 of 4 p.c. State-guaranteed stock payable
in 1914. First, the State as holder of the prefs.,
takes 5 p.c., then the ordinaries take 5 p.c., then for
each extra 1 p.c. that the State gets up to a total of
10 p.c. the ordinaries take 2 p.c. But the State
stops at 10 p.c., while the ordinaries may soar as
high as the profits will take them. No doubt they
would have got more than 15 p.c. long ago if it
hadn’t been for the million falling due in 1914 ; but
the management very wisely decided to get, if possible,
a million of reserves by that time, and, though it
looked just about impossible, the thing has been done,
and done easily. And this is the concern which, be-
fore the State “interfered”—practically driven thereto
at the muzzle of the general manager’s gun—had un-
dertaken to pay a flinty Cohen £1,575,000 for a
temporary 61 p.c. loan of £1,312,500.
When Richard Seddon made his last bargain with
the bank, getting for the State £500,000 of pref.
capital, he undertook not only to leave the State’s
guarantee for a million in the business, but to back
the Assets Realisation Board as well ; and the Board’s
unredeemed debentures at the time were about
£1,800,000. This Assets Board had been created
when the crisis came in 1893-4, its job being to first
nurse and then get rid of the most rocky-looking
assets. There is no need to talk again about Maori-
land’s remarkably rapid recovery, first under Ballance
and then under the earlier Seddon. The public also
knew that unless the country broke, the bank could
not now be allowed to break ; and when you can
make people feel like that about a bank you have done
the biggest thing that it is possible to do for any
bank. So the B.N.Z. bounded ahead faster even than
the country ; for no competitor in the chase for new
business had a backing like this. Current profits were
thus available to help the Assets Board unload
quickly ; and the unloading was so rapid that three
years ago the Board was dissolved, and the bank took
over the sediment in the old sink. On March 31 all
that was left to represent the ancient trouble—which
ran into £2,680,000, originally—was £136,356, and
that was made up not of old assets but of purchasers’
balances on the sale of old assets. It has been a
wonderful clean-up, and most of the wonderfulness of
it has been due to the backing of the State. If
there is any doubt about that, consider the different
kind of progress made by the Commercial Bank of
Australia, which didn’t have State backing to help it
out and on.
Going into details, the following makes a compari-
son of a four-year period:—

That biggish increase of advances accompanied by a
bigger shrinkage of deposits doesn’t look any too well.
Maoriland has been booming on a riot of borrowing,
and there is nothing more demoralising to a country
than that. At this bank’s meeting 12 months ago the
chairman warned the country that for the previous
four years the exports had been £2,342,815 short of
enough to pay for imports and interest. If a country
doesn’t pay for its imports with its current produc-
tion, it can do it in only two other ways—bv dipping
into its savings or by choking the creditor off with a
p.n. While the Dominion has had its partly-artificial
boom the B.N.Z. has been in the fattest clover. When
the borrowing stops and the boom stops with it, it is
pretty certain that the figures will show up differ-
ently. For a while when the boom is petering out
and money is getting scarce.a bank can put a good
face on things by shoving up its rate for accommoda-
tion. But in many cases that simply means adding to
an already doubtful debt; and the trouble comes
when the security has to be taken over and disposed
of at a loss. In order to meet that trouble some
banks in good times build up big internal reserves.
This paper doesn’t know whether the B.N.Z. is one
of them. But from the way the bank premises ac-
count has been written down it judges that the
management is prudent and has a bit up its sleeve.

Goldsbrough, ilort and Co. had a bad smash in the
early ’9O s, the financial crisis in this case being
complicated with drought and rabbits. The aroma
that hung around some of the subsequent arrange-
ments and rearrangements wasn't exactly sweet, and
there are old debenture-holders who still feel sore
about the loss of 40 p.c. of their capital, not so
much because the capital went as because wealthy
shareholders escaped meeting the liability on their
shares. Certainly the share capital was cut down
violently too; but nowadays some of it is being
restored, whereas all that the debenture-holders have
got by way of restitution is that the “B” debentures
now receive a fixed 5 p.c. instead of a conditional
5 p.c. Probably there is no other way by which
the wind could be tempered to the shorn debenture-
holder at this time of day.
If Providence had been on the Board of this co. it
is hard to imagine how things could have been
arranged to suit it better. It looked like dreadful
luck to have to _ take over some of the pastoral
properties that this co. had to take over; yet some
of the worst : looking of them must have turned out
best. For instance, the Far West of N. S. Wales
and Queensland, which was mostly a wilderness, with
too much dust and dry hones in its throat even to
howl in the early - 90’s, has been as good as a mint
the last few years. Moreover, when the Australian
Government showed that it meant business in connec-
tion with the land tax and the disruption of hi 0 "
freehold estates, stock-raisers saw that their best
chance was to go out beyond the limits of the free-
hold ; and so the far-out leaseholds, in which this
and one or two similar cos. were heavilv interested,
acquired an additional value. Further, its Mathoura
and other freehold estates were driven on to the
market at a time when the market was most eager
to have them. How much property the co. has dis-
posed of it is impossible to say, because properties
and advances are lumped ; but there must have b ,:, en
very large realisations, which no doubt account for
much of the bloated profit of the past few years.
But the co. can’t sell the same property twice*
hence it is highly probable that recent profits are
abnormal and won’t continue. At the same time it
is also highly probable that the co. has been putting
a bit up its sleeve. As one lot of securities have
been realised, advances have been made on another
lot (or often, no doubt, on the same lot) ; and though
the new owner would have to bring in some cash
prices have been so high that it is quite likely some
of these securities will be thrown on to the co’s
hands again. Whether the co. has an internal re-
serve to meet that contingency, this paper doesn't
know. If it hasn’t, any losses will of course have
to be set against future profits, or be made «-ood
out of visible reserves. Apart from profits on sales,
the co. must also have done extraordinarily well
from its commission business, partly because‘of the
high prices, partly because of the big clips, etc.
The next table shows how things have gone since
the last cleaning-up in 1900 (the figures are as at
March 31 m each case, before the appropriations are
made) :—•

The capital is in £1 shares fully paid. The deben-
ture stock has a first mortgage over the freehold and
leasehold business premises, and has also the security
of a floating charge over all other assets. The bulk
of the reserves which have been accumulated are
m liquid assets; but, as before remarked, there may
be also internal reserves. This and most other
pastoral cos. nowadays take their live stock in at a
fixed low figure, and if the stock lives to reach mar-
ket, the surplus realised over that figure is profit.
Ihe stock now on this co. s holdings might easily he
vvorth £lOO,OOO more than book-value if it were’sold
now; hence that £lOO,OOO represents a sort of
fund to provide against possible stock losses in the
future. Also, it will be observed that the premises
account has been written down hard. The co. is in
the biggest gambling business in Australia; but so
tar as one can tell it has put itself in a strong posi-
tion to meet the hard knocks that are bound to come.
Profits for the past year shown in the table have
subject to the following visible deductions :
"™ t ® premises, plant and reserve investments,
£14,670; bonus to staff and vote for provident fund
£13,461. A further £20.000 has been put by “for
the purpose of building wool stores in Queensland in
the near future.” This sum may be written off later
on ; for the present it is reckoned with the reserves
m the foregoing tables.

In the past decade only one half-year gave a better
result than the past six months; and if you look
at that on the surface it doesn’t seem at all like the
fading of a boom. But, as a matter of fact, a bank
can and frequently does show better profits when the
tide is running out than when it is at its full. When
money gets tight a bank puts up its deposit rate
perhaps i p.c. ; but it rarely pays J p.c. more with-
out charging 1 p.c. more. And when it puts up its
rate for 2-year deposits from 3-J to 4 p.c. it still has
the use of the old deposits at the old rate until the
term for which they were fixed runs out, and that
also tends to make the first few months or the first
year of financial strain a very profitable period.
A J S .°> it frequently uses a good deal of money for
which it pays nothing, and the extra 1 p.c. on that
is all so much to the good. In this case, for in-
stance, the bank holds £330,845 of free deposits,
but it has only £231,836 in liquid assets, and some
of those are earning money, so it is obvious that the
co. is earning money with over £lOO,OOO for which
it is not paying anything; and an extra 1 p.c. on
that amount alone is £lOOO a year. Unfortunately
a bank doesn't usually get cash for the interest it
earns on its advances. This debt to the bank is
merely added on to a liability which is already per-
haps too large, and the trouble only shows up later
on when the insufficient security has to be realised.
That was how most of the banks came to think they
were doing splendidly up to within a few weeks of
the time they had to shut their doors 20 years ago.
Present conditions are, however, not the same as
those which preceded that smash; and no smash
need be feared now, unless other causes get to work.
In those days the banks had been borrowing lavishly
from the foreigner, and it was the foreign depositor
who caused the trouble. This time the banks haven't
been filled up with foreign money ; so there won’t be
any desperate rush from Glasgow and other remote
parts to take their capital out of the country—the
action which previously involved rapid realisations
and a break-neck slump. All the same, the boom
must ebb ; and the fact that a bank's visible profits
are still increasing is no proof that the ebb hasn't
started. Also, it isn’t to be taken as proof that the
banks are going to escape scathless.
The Tasmanian National’s balance-sheet figures
compare with those of 12 months ago in this way:—

The shrinkage of the note circulation is due, of
course, to the Commonwealth note issue. The
£7976 still out no doubt includes many notes which
have been lost or accidentally destroyed ; these will
never be presented, and will amount to a perpetual
deposit at 2 p.c. or whatever the rate of “composi-
tion” payable to the State may be. For the rest,
there are no movements of any consequence.
Earnings in proportion to capital and reserves com-
bined are very satisfactory, provided, of course,
proper provision has been mace for contingencies.
Recent results on this basis:—
Nov., 1907 .. £8 19 3 p.c. I May, 1910 .. £7 19 11 p.c.

The liquid assets held in proportion to total debt are
distinctly on the small side ; but otherwise the posi-
tion is good and strong. The public’s money in the
business represents only £3 2s. for every £1 of the
shareholders’ money; and that is a very safe pro-
portion.

This co. again declares a 10 p.c. dividend and pays
a bonus of Is. a share, at the same time making a
call of Is. There are 20,000 shares of 50s. in the
co. ; and this present transaction will make them
12s. paid. The business is growing very rapidly.
Five years ago the trust accounts in hand were
valued at £394,499 ; now the total is no less than
£1,560,453. Commission earnings certainly haven’t
increased at the same rate, or anything like it; but
that is probably because the general-agency business
isn’t what it was. Still, while revenue from that
source may have fallen off, the growth of the trust
business far more than counterbalances it, because
the trust business is the sort that usually sticks for
years. Also, the rapid movement of the trust figures
is a good sign that the man who proposes to die or
otherwise quit the country is more and more sensibly
disposed to leave his affairs in the hands of an exe-
cutor or attorney who won’t also die or clear out,
and who has put up £12,400 with the Treasurer as
a guarantee of good behavior. This £12,400 is
represented by the certificate of title to the co.’s pre-
mises. Its other investments amount to £11,520,
mostly in public securities and mortgages. The in-
vestments are a very profitable lot. The premises
account shows a return of nearly 74 p.c. on the book
value; and rent and interest combined would pay 10
p.c. on the present capital, without any help from
the business. The other side of the sheet is quite
clean ; the co. has no liabilities at all. The whole
position is thus very pleasant. The assets represent
on their book value 265. per share, and for once in
a way the real value is probably more than the book
value; and not only are the assets apparently very
sound, but the return is exceptionally good—for the
past five years the business as a whole has averaged
just over 25 p.c. p.a. on the present capital. And it
is growing ; yet it wouldn’t be safe to reckon that the
revenue will keep growing in proportion to the turn-
over. Admittedly the trustee co. does a heap more
for its commission than, say, the average auctioneer
or property-agent, yet in view of the big profits dis-
closed by many of these cos. the tendency of the
commissions must be downwards. And nothing is
much surer than that those States which haven’t
already got a public trustee will before long follow
Great Britain and appoint one. Or, better still, the
Commonwealth may take the business in hand. There
isn’t any visible reason why the job shouldn’t be
done by the Commonwealth Bank, which will have
practically all the necessary machinery.

This society had the usual bad time when the Mel-
bourne boom smashed suddenly; but it lived on
husks and barley water for some years, applied its
earnings to the writing-down of over-valued assets,
and thus managed to pull through. In 1897 it was
able to resume ordinary business in a modest way,
and since then it has been going along placidly.
This shows the progress it has made: —
19n2. 1911. 1912.
Capital £16,825 £21,974 £22,113
Deposits and other liabilities 16,539 27.972 33,695
Advances 33,8(3 53,640 56,831
Other assets 986 1,520 4,40 i
Combined capital and reserves amount to £25.959
and the liabilities (mostly deposits) total £33,695;
so the proportion of liabilities is not excessive. The
reserves, are, however, very slight, and what there
are don't seem too good. Anyway, there is a pretty
frequent cut at a contingency fund which forms part
of the reserves; last year, for instance, £604 went
“in adjustment of accounts arising out of sales of
properties in possession.” This paper can’t say
what is the book value of properties in possession ;
apparently these assets are lumped in the item —•
“Loans, £56,831.” If the society can make a loss
of £ 604 on one year's realisations, it would be a
fair thing to assume that the entire bundle of over-
valued properties is pretty large. If so, the reserves
may be wholly fictitious. It is the society’s own
fault if too unfavorable a view is thus taken of its
position ; it could easily avoid giving a wrong im-
pression, by setting out the book value of the fore-
closed properties, even if it isn’t prepared to do the
strictly-proper thing and put them in at present
value. Meantime, in the absence of precise informa-
tion on his point, and with very considerable doubt
hanging over some of the reserves which would be
poor even if no doubt hung over them, the society
appears to have made a mistake in putting the divi-
dend up to 7 p.c. In short, the protection offered
to depositors and other creditors seems ample ; but
the accumulation of profits to protect the share-
holders’ capital is very poor.

Solomon Islands Development Co.,
formed in Sydney in 1908 to make plantations and
grow rubber, copra, bananas and dividends: —

This co. is in Burns, Philp and Co.’s stable; Janies
Burns is its chairman, and Walter Lucas, B.P.’s
islands manager, is its general manager. The co.’s
area isn’t precisely defined, but there are approxi-
mately 48,056 acres contained in six estates—
-28,056 acres freehold (subject to an improvement
clause), the rest leasehold. The capital is in 618
shares of £lOO, of which so far £65 has been called
up; total called, £40,170. Practically all this
money has been put into the estates. The purchase
price was less than half the total; the balance re-
presents buildings and development. Only adminis-
tration has hitherto been charged to Profit and Loss;
and the profit shown above is the net revenue from
sales of produce less costs of administration. Pre-
sumably the men who do the developing also do the
producing, and it must be a pretty tough job to say
how much of the total costs ought to be charged
against the produce and how much should go on to
development account. It seems certain that the pub-
lished statement can’t be anything more than a
rough estimate; but the fairly rapid growth of pro-
fits may be taken as a hint that, to. the best of the
management’s belief, the business is going on all
right. There unquestionably are enormous possibili-
ties in it. Of the 48,000 acres or thereabouts only
202 so far are under rubber and 15 under sisal hemp
—neither lots yet producing—with another 3000
acres or so under cocoanuts (the bananas are cropped
in between) ; so there’s plenty of room for the co.
to spread. But land isn’t the trouble; it’s the
supply of labor that must make the management
think. The co. had only 373 “boys” on March 31,
1912, as against 433 a year before, and “it is be-
coming increasingly evident that the necessary native
workers will have to be secured from other than local
sources,” the directors say. But it’s easier said than
done. Probably because it has seen what is happen-
ing in Fiji the British Government won’t allow any
Solomon Islands developer to bring in indentured
labor, and as far as things have gone it looks as
though the British Government, will take a lot of
shifting from that attitude. With the co.’s present
labor supply it vyill not be able to do much more
than fight the weeds and do the other necessary jobs
in the plantations already made.
But though further development work must be slow
unless the co. has more luck in recruiting, it proposes
to provide itself with more capital for the big job.
One new share is to be offered present shareholders
for every two now held ; this issue is to be at a pre-
mium of £l6 ss. The idea is to steadily call up the
capital on the new shares till, like the original
issue, they are £65 paid. If (as happens pretty
often) a shareholder has only one share, he will have
a chance to tender for the fractions (there will be
44 shares to go that way) ; any surplus realised over
the fixed £l6 ss. will be paid to the one-share share-
holders. The co. certainly wants the money that will
be got from the new issue; before paying the current
dividend it had only £1799 in liquid assets and it
owed £4840.

Still no explanation is given as to why £584 carried
forward in 1910 dropped out of the 1911 accounts
and caused an apparent slump of the profits in that
year. The demand for money has evidently been
brisk lately, and the society has had to go to the
bank for help in financing its customers. This, of
course, while it adds to the profits, adds also to the
risks. The mortgages current on March 31 were
£14,699, so the reserves, though not massive, are
fairly good in proportion to the risks, assuming that
the management has a level head and requires a fair
margin when making an advance. The exes, are
very moderate.
Those 20-year option policies that the
Yankee insurance offices pushed on Australia in the
old gilt-snurred rooster days are beginning to come
home. The favorite canvassing method of those
times was to issue an illustration card to the intend-
ing insurer showing what he might expect, basing
the expectation on “the society’s actual experience
up to 1892.” The comparison that follows shows
what an intending insurer was told to expect and
what he is now told he can have: —
The Bait. The Reality.
Gash value .. <486 12 0 £377 2 6
Paid-up value .. 1092 0 0, 774 0 0
Life annuity .. 37 4 0 23 16 8
The policy was with the Equitable. Naturally the
insurer has turned in his sorrow to Australian offices
to find out how things would have panned out with
them, and he finds that, whereas the foreign office
offers £7l 2s. in excess of the premiums, the
A.M.P. the other day actually paid £125 2s. on a
slightly higher-aged risk, accepted at about the same
time under a similar table. And if the man had
died after insuring with the A.M.P. his widow would
have got some bonuses, whereas with the Equitable
none would have been added in the event of death
during the 20-year period.

The dam is at Umberumberka, and the water will

gravitate to the mines. If there was a steady lift
all the way the pulsing would keep the pipes moist;
with a partly-gravitation scheme the chances are that

it’s the upper part that will taste the Broken Hill

Australian smelters are steadily increas-
ing their output of precious metals. The big six,
which run chiefly on copper ore, produced no less
than £83,000 worth of gold and silver in May:—
Tons.
Oz. Gold. Oz. Silver. Copper.
Mount Morgan 10,050 Nil. 782
Great Cobar i. 5,137 21,261 701

Mount Elliott . . 1,091 1,210 635
Great Fitzroy .. 691 3,262 140
18,358 79,588 2,835
Of these six Chillagoe is the only one producing both
lead and copper; including its 307 tons of lead,
3142 tons of base metal contained some £26 per ton
of precious metals. The two most important Aus-
tralian lead smelters are at Cockle Creek (N.S.W.)
and the Broken Hill Prop., at Port Pirie (S.A.).
The latter produced 6590 tons of lead and 301,1340 z.
silver last month. At Cockle Creek, the Sulphide
Corporation treats large quantities of purchased ore
and concentrates; the latest weekly return was —lead
410 tons, silver 30,2620 z., gold 9330 z. Last year’s
output was: lead 18,271 tons, silver 1,352,9840 z.
and gold 62,9190 z., so they are running lead bullion
containing nearly £2O per ton of precious metals.
The prospectus of the Goodrich Copper
Mine, N.L., contains 30 pages of assay certificates
and the reports of five mining engineers upon an
inoffensive copper-gold mine near Yeoval, 30 miles
from Wellington (N.S.W.). The show is only moder-
ately opened up, and the ore, which averages 2 p.c.
copper and a little gold, will be concentrated and
transported to smelters, as fluxes and fuel are not
available. In the reports of the five engineers, almost
the only thing agreed upon is the “highly payable”
nature of the proposition, though they have also this
in common —their estimates of yield are all based on
a 100 p.c. extraction or more. The estimates of cost
are based on Heaven knows what. This is a sample
of the data on which the public is invited to lay its
money: “The following statement of values is based
on 8 p.c. copper and 13dwt. gold per ton, and is
made on the assumption that milling and concen-
trating machinery is erected on the mine capable of
treating 100 tons per week, producing 25 tons of
concentrates, worth 32 p.c. copper and 13dwt. gold
per ton of ore milled.’’ It seems a pity that the
ore from 100 tons is not going to be concentrated up
to 100 tons instead of only 25, for then the ore
would be worth 128 p.c. copper at least. After an
intricate network of costs is gone through the profit
per week is found to be £ 553. Another man states
that stuff which assayed loz. ldwt. 6gr. gold is “what
I would call country,” which seems to argue that the
show must be fairly rich. The capital is to be
£50,000 in 100,000 shares, 20.000 fully-paid to the
vendors, who also take £3OOO ; but this can be
reckoned as £l5OO, because the second instalment is
to be paid only out of profit.
* * * *
The brightest prospect at Wyalong
(N S.W.) is in the Junction, whose owners are
driving levels at 950 ft. The ore bodies evidently
go further south than the surface indications led the
original prospectors to believe. In the upper work-
ings there was no gold south of the old Junction
shaft; now the best gold is being found over 1000 ft.
south of it. This makes the field hope again that it
has not come to the end of its tether. In order'to
cope with the increased supply of free milling ore, an
additional 10 head of stamps are being erected on
the Junction, and the best stone is still being sent
to Cockle Creek.
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) produced
£403,428 in 1911, and after charging up all expen-
diture for that period and writing £25,500 off
plant and machinery, the accounts show a credit bal-
ance of £4958. This with the Previous unappro-
priated balance of £26,365, making in all,
has been carried forward. Ore reserves are given as
804 269 tons of a recoverable value of £l,zs/,iu»,
which, on the present cost of production mcans a
profit in sight of something under £300,000. But
as nearly all this—if extracted—will be required to
pay off debentures and square up tor interest and a
hundred-and-one odds and ends—administration ex-
penses, taxes, etc.—the present market quotation for
the shares mostly represents what hopeful buyers
are willing to pay for the rather remote possibilities
of the mine at depth.
Aided by a new gas-producer plant, Sirdar
fW A ) has resumed crushing, and last month tieatea
1000 tons for £478. A much larger tonnage is ex-
pected to be treated monthly, but the prospects of
shareholders getting anything seem as tar off as
ever. The show is middling in its way. but has not
proved good enough for a co. with 60,000 shares.
An official circular credits Whim Well
(W.A.) with several rich copper developments m
the’Nos. 1 and 2 levels and adits. The Mur ®* mag ,'
netic plant is expected to start in a few months, and
even if the copper market should fall several pounds
bXv its present height, it is expected that profits
at the rate of £60,000 per annum will be earned
from the lower-grade ore, apart from what ma;y
made from the picked stuff. A heap of 50,000 tons
of 7 p.c. ore, from which £60,000 is expected, is
now awaiting the attention of the new plant. The
mine has surpassed expectations so far but it
still remains to be proved at depth. And that s
where nine copper mines out of 10 go wrong.

The Westralian Full Court has ordered a
refund of £2512 extorted from the Bullfinch Prop
as excess fees under threat of non registration. At
the time of presentation, the to ge eo^had
stamps affixed to the amount of £2OOO, was
on the expressed consideration of £400,000, was
enough. The registrar, however, was not satisfied,
and consulted the State Attorney-General, who de-
cided that the true consideration was not £400,000,
but £lOO,OOO cash and 300,000 vendors shares. Hav-
ing come to this decision, he fixed d uty at £4512,
being £5OO on the cash consideration of £lOO,OOO,
and £4012 on the market value of 300,000 shares,
which he appraised at the same figure as ordinary
shares were quoted at on the day the transfers weie
presented for registration. The agreement between the
vendors (Doolette and Shallcross) 'oC* 1 00 0 °°ca-h ’*as
. lated that, notwithstanding the £lOO,OOO ca. n as
part consideratior, this sum must be invested in the
purchase of 100,000 ordinary shares, which the co.
undertook to supply at par. Obviously there ore, the
co. did not reckon the shares worth mgre than £1
each on the date of the agreement, so the Court
ordered the Government to disgorge the sum men-
tioned, with costs.

scale is in progress elsewhere. lurther north, at
Leonora, the business men have decided to club t -

Burbanks Main Lode (W.A.) has just
paid its fourth div., and brought its total distribu-
tion up to about £12,000. This show is one of the
few going concerns at Coolgardie, and by treating
its own ore and crushing for the public manages to
carry on business at a profit.
Commodore (W.A.) recovered £1540 from
its first crushing of 1500 tons. Deduct the May
costs and a surplus of £6OO is shown. But as the
mill started about the middle of April there is some
more expenditure to be charged up, and when this
is done the real profit will amount to only a hundred

J. 11. Fawcett’s report, which represented
Mount Oxide (Q.) as an undeveloped show, has
caused the option syndicate to change its plans, lhe
original idea was to form a co. in 800,000 10s.
shares; the new idea is to form one of £200,000
in £1 shares, 140,000 shares being “segregated for
mine purchase, flotation and development capital,
while 60,000 are distributed among the shareholders
in the option syndicate. The syndicate won t be wound
up; in fact, it is possible that it may get a further
cut out of the earmarked 140,000 shares.

The Duchess (Q.) railway is now into
the mine and ready to take ore to Hampden for
treatment. A few small creeks are not bridged yet,
but deviations have been made, and the whole line
should be completed by August. The Hampden
smelter should be ready by the end of this month.
Mount Elliott is opening out on 60ft. of ore at the
550t't. level. It appears to be a very large body ot
mixed grade, easily sorted. A value of 20 to 30 p.c.
can be maintained, and it is good smelting stun.
Generally the mine is looking well. Ihe May out-
put was a record, and from the way copper is coming
out, it looks as if the June return will not be far. be-
hind.
At Mount Cuthbert they are only marking time;
but if the reported £50,000 is raised, it will put a
bit of life into the district. Cuthbert has, however,
not the grade of ores that Duchess and Elliott have,
so great care will have to be taken to get the right
class of plant. The first section of the Cuthbert line
(about 40 miles) will be commenced in about six
or eight weeks time. From the end of the first
section a further 25 or 30 miles will have to be
built, and then a six-mile siding laid through rough
country to connect with the mine. This line will
open up some fine pastoral country, and later on will
be carried on to good mineral country. To extend
from Cuthbert to Mount Oxide, some 80 to 100 miles,
would, however, cost a mint of money, and that
route may for the present be turned down as im-
practicable.
General Manager Corbould’s three years with
Mount Elliott having expired, it is reported he leaves
in July for England. It is quite likely that he will
not return as general manager, though he may still
be connected with the co., making Sydney his head-
quarters. Undoubtedly much credit is due to him
for the way he has handled his show. Cloncurry
had for years promised large outputs, but share-
holders got nothing but promises until Corbould took
a hand.

The developments at the Duchess and the
completion of the railway from the Hampden-Clon-
eurry (Q.) have inspired an effort to shake up a
couple of adjoining leases. These have lain idle for
years, after the sinking of a couple of shallow shafts
which didn’t encourage the owners to go deeper. The
Northern Duchess, of 15 acres, has a lode, presumed
to be the same as the Duchess is working. But lode
isn’t necessarily ore, and, though the levels of the
Duchess have a' long way to go yet before the northern
boundary is reached, there are plentiful indications
already of patchiness. The best developments are m
sinking. There is supposed to be a fault on the
southern end of the Duchess, so the lode in the
Southern Duchess, of 10 acres, may or may not be
the one wanted. It is probably the Duke, which has
had a stony career, so far. However, a syndicate is
being formed to acquire a six-months’ option over
the two leases for £4OO down and £l6OO if exer-
cised. The capital is £7500 in 750 shares of £lO
each 200 of which are to be offered for subscription
at par, and 100 issued to the vendors (at par, tacitly
assumed) in part-payment for the option ; the other
450 will be held in reserve. There won t be much
for development work, which is far from cheap m
that neighborhood.

New Brilliant Freeholds, Charters Towers
(O ) has its underlay shaft down about 370 ft. below
the No 4 level. Very little was met with on the
way. The intention is to pick up the make of stone
left at the boundary by the Mills United No. 14
level; the latter is being continued into the Free-
holds at an agreed price of £4 per foot, and when
the shaft is deep enough a drive will be opened west.
The output for last half-year was 9532 tons, which
with 9235 tons of re-treated residues yielded
£32,571. Profit, £15,053. Three divs. amounting
to 2s. od. per share were paid, and these absorbed
£19,652. Liquid assets at the end of the period
totalled £19,262, since which the 17th dividend of
6d. per share has been paid. #
For its half-year Brilliant Extended,
Charters Towers, crushed 19,210 tons for £34,850.
The stone was poorer than usual, and costs rose to
over £2 per ton; hence a loss of £2987. The
future depends wholly on a fairly extensive policy of
development, for present reserves are low in quantity
and qualitv. The hope is that better stone will come
in before 'the underlay shaft reaches 3000 ft. lhis
deepest shaft is known as No. 3; another (No. 2) is
also to be sunk, and various blocks of ground pro-
spected to the east and west of No. 3.

find has been made at Rossville, near Cooktown. A
big flood of last year bit into the bank of the river,
and exposed a face of wash-dirt nearly 12ft. deep.
A shaft sunk a few feet back gave very coarse tin
from top to bottom. Geo. Young and Oliver Hall
are the original prospectors, and lately two others
fossicking some quarter of a mile above the prospec-
tors’ claim, picked up several lumps of oxide weigh-
ing up to 91b. and one of 301 b. Other fair finds have
been made, but as the ground is covered by a dense
scrub prospecting is slow.

Victoria had 54 bucket dredges at wcirk
last year, and it got 59,4980 z. of gold with them
That meant l'i grains per yard or 101-loz. per
acre. The most strenuous dredge turned over 13,000
cubic yards per week; four others passed the
11 oOOvd. mark. Twenty-one cos. paid dividends,
total distribution, £46,486. Running exes, and
maintenance amounted to £156,975. Bi? Piants
cost £284,607. Hydraulic (pump) sluicing was

Garden Gully Consols, Bendigo, is as full
of hone as an egg is of meat. It is tucked away
south on the Garden Gully line, and has the Lansell
influence as well as the names of Quick and Mrost
to buttress it. So far hope is the mam asset tor
while a big formation was hit at 500 ft., it was
about as barren of gold as a Tory policy is of de-
finite proposals. Because of the slides and the faults
and the spurs and the threads the shaft has been
taken down another 120 ft. to see if hopes can be
materialised into one of the big saddle-caps that
made the mines to the north of this baby the best
gold-winners in Bendigo. There is plenty of boodle

pluck is needed to keep the pick going.

Williams Fancy, Berringa (Vic.), has had
poor luck with the half-year’s development, and
stone is so short that 10 head of stamps have been
hung up. The one cheerful spot is south on the
f ancy lode, at the bottom level; but a break is
ahead, and nobody knows yet what there is beyond
that Though nearly £lOOO went in prospecting,
and though the 894 8 y tons of stone handled averaged
onlv a shade over 34dwt., there was a profit of £2BO
Mining and treatment costs were 11s. 10id., and
management exes, were under 6d. The co. was lucky
r getting suction gas and other money-savers in
while it had the cash, for there s only £3OO or so
left at the banker’s now.

Boring at Mount Lyell would have been
dangerous if Chairman Jamieson hadn t snicked m
the Lveil Comstock leases for his co. This business
having been fixed, word has gone round that the
drill is to go out “to determine the trend of the
formations at the bottom level into the Comstock
ground.” There isn’t any certainty that the trend
is not into the Blocks lease nor even that the
shoots live down below where they are proved. They
mav be expected to do so, but replacements like the
North Lveil formations sometimes favor and sometimes
disappoint. The new-development ore body was a help ,
the 1000 ft level a chastener to the geological pro-
phet. Sticht seems to have turned Mount Balfour
down, for he has T. B. Moore out in the snows and
slides of Mounts Jukes and Darwin to se *L J*oSf

“Plat”: Something of a novelty in the
mining line is the Savage River iridium field ex-
tending from 20 to 30 miles south-west of Mount
Bischoff (Tas.). The world’s supply of iridium is
mostly obtained as a by-product of alluvial gold and
platinum. Here the ground is wrought for its
iridium contents, the gold being a by-product. The
distribution of the metal leaves no room to doubt
that it is shed from serpentine country, but the
exact matrix has not, so far, been fixed. The coun-
try is extremely steep and broken; the rocks are of
great geologic antiquity, and, as they became
weathered, the metal slowly trickled down from the
serpentine hills into creek and river beds, where
it underwent a natural concentration. At the north-
west end of the field there are only a few grains of
gold to the ounce of iridium, but going south-west
the river cuts gold-bearing strata, and the gold con-
tents increase to about 4dwts. to the oz. of the
white metal. As the river winds its way to join the
Pieman, the iridium gets poorer, and finally gold
becomes the dominant metal in the river gravels.
It is necessarily a summer field, work having to be
almost entirely suspended in the winter months,
owing to a chronic state of flood, due to the heavy
rainfall —3yds. per annum. Last summer a mild
rush set in, from 100 to 150 men being on the field.
The result of their labor was an output of over
700 oz. cf iridium for the season; quantity of gold
not known. Twenty years ago the metal was value-
less, and the first 'sales were made at 255. per oz.
Next, Colonel Hughes, of Melbourne, bought for a
considerable time at £-2 10s. per oz. Since then
the price has gradually soared up, until this year it
reached £7 ss. Later, however, it had a set-
back to £7 for coarse metal and £5 for fine,
through incompetent agents flopping dirty meta. on
to the principal buyers. No such distinction in price
is made in the London or N’York quotations. thus
again does the producer suffer for the sins ot the
middleman. .

According to the managing director of the
Radium Hill Co. (S.A.), magnetic separation or con-
centration is doing well on the low-grade iron and
uranium oxide mixture of which this co. is alleged
to have large quantities above the 60ft. level, lhere
appears to be enough ore developed to keep the pre-
sent small mill going for 10 years; but no definite
information is available about the money value that
can be taken out of a ton of crude ore containing a
low percentage of uranium. The mill manager has
had instructions to send regular shipments of 15 tons
of concentrates per week to the Sydney treatment
works. The quantity is so small that it will have to
contain a very high value to pay all the expenses,
because there is no other mineral product requiring
more elaborate treatment than radium bromide, lhe
managing director states that a parcel of radium
bromide has been sold for delivery in July, but
nothing is said about weight or value.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement W orks, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings ot
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, thev can apply to the Australian Agents,
W and J. Lempriere, Melbourne; or E. W. Hurst-
house and Co., of Wellington, the agents in New

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Filter is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous, and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly sub-
merged in a tank of slimes or material to be fil-
tered. The drum is covered with a filter cloth sup-
ported on grooves on the drum, which are connected
by means of holes to the interior, to allow the liquid
to be withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the end
of the drum the vacuum pipe passes, through which
the liquid and air are withdrawn by means of a
vacuum pump. The filtered slime is removed
by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth, as it
revolves, is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing
the sucking in of air and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one forming. The residual liquid in the slime cake
is removed by distributing water over the surface ot
the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that the
filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it is
continuous in operation, and has no complication ot
valve to get out of order; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the drum. The Austral Otis Engineering Com-
pany, of South Melbourne, have the sole manufactu-
ring rights of this filter.* » 1

WOMMAN'S
LITTER
Sydney, June 17, 1912.
My Deak Aeini, —
That attractive widow, Mrs. R. Simpson,
a sister-in-law of the smartly-turned-out
“Mrs. Ted” of that name, is engaged to
engineer Lucy, who is something important
in the State Railway and Short of Trucks
Department—the one that leaves the wheat
behind. He is a widower with a trio of jolly
little children, who belong to the cult of
No-Hat and bare feet, with sandals some-
times. Bride-to-be is a daughter of the late
Warden Harry Graves (the wool man), and
has two youngsters of her own to add to the
merry tribe of No-Hatters. The engagement
was hung up in private for a few weeks, but
is now open to the blare of congratulation
by phone or penny post.
Major-General Finn, who once presided
over war councils in these parts, is now
smoking the pipe of peace in Maoriland. He
has returned, by the way, to his retired Im-
perial rank of colonel. The larger tag was
only a local fixture during his trek on the
Australian warpath. The ex-warrior is war-
ily stalking the rainfall in the brisk little
Islands of Quake with his cousin, Mr. Har-
old Finn. Soldier Finn is suspected of con-
templating bucolic pursuits thereabouts, and
is looking the M.L. cow straight in the eye.
Sydney’s auction-hunting section of wom-
ankind is still clawing the air with its post-
mortem remarks re the sale at Ruperra,
Darling Point. This was the roof-tree of the
late Justice Cohen. His wife’s taste ran to
pink and white, and some of the chalk-white
rooms were hung with ecstasies in frothy
lace.
Mrs. Cohen’s bedroom must have given
her a becoming blush, for the decorative
ceiling was a shy pink. Lady Dudley was
also a profound student of rose, in the pale
bud and in deeper tints. She generally
carried hangings of that helpful color with
her personal luggage when she visited up-
country homesteads. The wallpaper of
wealthy Mutton is very often counted
amongst the 477 deadly sins.
The much-travelled Miss Jessie Acker-
mann F.R.G.S. (they handed her this tail
in Edinburgh some time ago), has been con-
cealed from the naked eye in N.S.W. during
the past few months. She has been work-
ing at literary research matter in town and
country, and has put in a long, restful patch
of time under the roof of the Kenneth Mac-
kays (up Wollundbeen way). Recently she
descended, much refreshed, to this town. The
widely travelled lady has been walking up
and down the face of the earth for so many
years that she’d feel at home in a cannibal
isle, provided the residents stuck to yams and
missionary diet. The brainy Jessie loves
nature —it can’t answer back. She has been
off the beaten track of travel so ofthn that
she can sleep like 20 tops in a bed of any
shape, size or religious convictions. If the
blankets are too short, or the iron ribs of the
frame too hard, she merely writes an essay
on its bad upbringing and primitive family
history, and lets it go at that. Also, she sell's
the essay. The ostrich is said to secretly
envy her digestion, and she firmly believes
she has as many lives as 10 house cats —
hence her robust physique after many adven-
t«res in queer holes of the earth. Jessie,
F.R.G.S., has kept a record of her daily
doings for 22 years. She has lectured for
many Governments on most subjects, has
covered 20,000 miles of this planet in one
record year of platform talk, and now thinks
of loafing round the world all of a sudden for
recreation.
Editor Jackson, of the Townsville Stab,
sent a brisk line re the recent ride of baronet
Barttelot through a section of the sunny
Northern Territory. The long A.D.C., who
uncoils himself on the G.-G.’s richly-uphol-
stered suite, is a mighty horseman in his
hours of ease when he can find a steed tall
enough to prevent his feet trailing on the
floor of things. So he snatched un a swag
or its rich relation, jumped on his Rosinante,
and gaily set forth across country to tilt at
Australian experience—windmills being
scarce in the Land of Lots of Time. The
ride of Don Barttelot covered 1236 miles in
easy stages, and he cantered through the
warm glow of 41 sunsets. According to the
Townsville chronicler, Don Capitaine de Gee-
Gee explored the route via Pine Creek, Roper
River. Booroolooloo (which is small brother
to Woolloomooloo and Orroroo) and the
Barclay Tableland to Cloncurry. He makes
hon. mention of Mr. Farren, of Nutwood
Downs; Mrs. Rogers, of Paddy’s Creek; and
other _Northern Territorians who rushed to
his aid when he wanted a change of nag.
The rider Barttelot declares he saw the
finest mob of cattle he ever set eyes on. at
Brunette Downs. He discovered plenty of
water all the way, and traces of other fluids,
met many promising signs of a goodly land,
and pounced on a polo suspect in the shape
of a likely-looking pony at Alexandra. Some
day Overlander Barttelot may fix the dazed
eyeglass of London Clubdom with his glitter-
mg eye, and tell it of a good land far away,
where the biled shirtfront of a worn-out
civilisation can be cast aside, and where a
newer and better race may sit under its
own palm tree, and drink out of its own
waterhole, and think great thoughts in the
shelter of its own anthill. And then London
Clubdom will rise as one man and say, “Bai
Jove.”
Ihe Alan Carroll Child Study Association
still carries on its vigorous warfare with the
woes ot small, weedy humanity. It demon-
strates _ every fourth Friday the wisdom of
developing juvenile bone and muscle out of
the pipe-stem size. Its stronghold is 254
Castlereagh-street, and June 28 is the date
ot the next battle.
The \\ oolloomooloo Day Nursery hopes to
look its milkman in the face with large and
increased orders when the annual ball in its
behalf shakes the rafters of Paddington
Town Hall. The afternoon of July 8 is
fixed for this dance, which is juvenile. It
runs to plain and fancy in its dress, and
Janie Snooks, aged 10 or thereabouts, can
go as Queen of the Earth or Sara Bernhardt,
or merely Jane, as most convenient to her
mother.
Melba bought a charming watercolor (a
Venetian scene), by Arthur Streeton, at the
•k me Arts Rooms (Bligh-street.), during her
recent look-in here. Twenty-five guineas was
the price. Two black-and-white sketches by
Norman Lindsay were purchased at the same
time by the Voice that Breathes o’er Lily-
dale.
“5.R.,” who wrote the par. from Tassy’s

I’onds, asks me to pass in the how-d’you-do

warded his contribution to the plucky little
girl who took sole charge of her brood of
small orphaned sisters and brothers.”
Lady Denman has discovered a clever
woman carver of decorative timber. She is
Miss Ruth Bannister, formerly of Bathurst
and now of Mosman’s terraced heights. For
five years she has been teaching at the Tech.
College (Sydney), where she first studied the
art of tooling wood under Mr. Wilkie. When
Miss Bannister exhibited some of her work
at the Women’s Exhibition, in Melbourne,
the only two papers in this settlement thkt
mentioned the remarkable wood-sculpture, for
which she snatched first prize, were The
Bulletin and the Sydney Mail. Miss
Bannister was not a society amateur. She
was toiling for a crust and a bacon-rind, and
no Personage had then set the hall-mark of
Government House on her work. The Mail,
which I represented in special articles on
the Women’s Exhibition (Melbourne), was so
daring as to publish Miss Bannister’s por-
trait. The Melbourne press handed her its
blessing in warm eulogies. Now the glory of
Government House makes a halo round'the
head of small Ruth Bannister, and all the
local world is her press agent! Her
Feathers has ordered a mantel and over-
mantel of carved timber, for one of the Den-
man homes in the country where the big
strikes grow. Melba has given her both
hands, and offered to exhibit in the right
quarter of Bull (I presume in palatial
premises) the girl’s beech panel of deeply-
carved grapes which caught the eye of her
Ex. as a remarkable piece of actual sculpture
rather than carved wood.
The Clergy Daughters’ School (Waverley)
added a new brick limb to its main body
the other day. Lady Chelmsford declared
the limb to be well and truly finished, and
Archbishop Wright said grace over the addi-
tional floor, and bade it rejoice. Miss
Lenthall is the learned principal of this
scholastic rib of the parson’s daughter.
Twenty-one bowlers who smite the sward
under the colors of the N.S.W. Bowling
Association, whereof the genial Spence is
President or First Lord of the Bowl, are still
dealing out anecdotes of their recent trip to
the Northern Rivers. From this office went
forth “Hop” and Mr. W Macleod to join the
Noble Nineteeen at the wharf. Each man
carried his own weapons—two bowls weigh-
ing about 31b. apiece. The beauteous royal
blue coats with white facings, monograms
en suite, white trousers and snowy shoes—
that dazzled the River bowler, were carefully
concealed in their kits.
Here is an Alfred Jinglesque summary ex-
tracted from “Hop”: “Chief hosts of tour,
managing-director Robert A. Bell and his co-
director, Mr. Rigg, of the North
Coast S.N. Co. Hospitality profuse and
heavily studded with civic receptions. Met
about four feet of water on Clarence River
bar. Struck civic reception in Grafton. Went
to Lismore by way of Casino. Council clerk
Mackenzie (Lismore) lenc his melodious
basso to a concert which came on the heels
of a dinner of great magnitude. At Lismore
Sydney bowlers were beaten. Only reverse
of the trip. Thence to Ballina. At Coraki,
more civic reception. More bowls. Coraki
regarded (by its principal inhabitants) as
the coming capital of Australia. Ballina.
More bowls. More victory. Green drew
well. Bangalow. Bowls and food. Narrow
victory on eccentric green. ‘Hop’ still won-
dering what happened to his first bowl. Mur-
willumbah the Revised. Charming town.
Good hostels. Refreshment for man and
beast up to top-notch. Excursion down the
Tweed River. Frantic excitement at its
mouth. One bowler caught one flathead.
Home to Sydney. Flathead growing larger.”
Hugh McMenamin had the courage to trot
out his pupil, the youthful pianist Alice
Rheinberger, with the support of a full
orchestra under the beat of Arundel Orchard.
Philosophers spoke up in advance of the event
and said: “Blessed are they who are prepared
to lose money with a cheerful countenace.”
But the experiment, which was made last
week in the chilly Y.M.C.A. Hall, was an
extensive success instead of an expensive
failure, as predicted by pessimists, dys-
peptics and other dwellers in barrels and
carriers of lanterns. The orchestra earned
its corn and a bit more, and the girl was
moved to do her best at the keyboard.
Grace Palotta, who grows perpetual youth
and fascinating French hats, was one of the
Op.hir’s best-frocked passengers when that
Orient speeder (or sea-lingerer, I don’t know
which) bustled into Fremantle some days
ago.
If Margaret Cooper had a volcano in her
temper, I fancy she’d attack some of her
worst photos, with a carving-knife or other
artillery. They mostly show a black-haired
dismal type of face with sombre eyes and a
heavy jaw. The real Margaret, musician,
reciter-singer and witch-in-general, is a
lively blonde, with a seraphic smile. Her
first appearance here was pushed out of this
letter by the battering-ram No Space, but
it s_ worth a belated sigh of envy. A foam-
white gown, substantial enough in its outer
filmy drape to be part of a mountain mist,
sparkled with the glitter of gold fringe. The
tunic of this heavenly creation (tunics, you
will have noticed, are cut off in their career
just below the knees) had a floating tail of
white foam. Whenever Margaret sat down,
she carefully lifted this loose end with its
golden glitter, out of harm’s way. The hand
that did the deed was small and dimpled at
the wrist like the pink fist of a child.
Tenor Paul Dufault, of the Eleanora Cis-
neros concert co._, is a French Canadian, of
the blue-eyed Wilfred Laurier type, though
shorter and more robust than Laurier. Du-
tault s good-looking young man face has grey-
ish hair brushed off his forehead in the old-
time Laurier manner (Canada’s leading
frenchman may have taken to the barber's
short clip in front, since I saw his picturesque
thatch in a London street.) Paul Dufault
has a manly, unaffected style that is quite
a continent away from the mincing affecta-
tions of the average foreign tenor —the one
who is the habitual idol of the flapper. He
pitches his lyric voice for oratorio and con-
-I'v,ork’ an d refuses to succumb to the
blandishments of grand opera. “Why leave
work in which I succeed, perhaps because I
like it so well, for opera, in which I might
tail to make a big place?” he asks. Why,
indeed?
The famous Stradivarius ’cello, which the
owner Liebling (of the Cisneros Concert Co.)
is alieged to guard with all the hereditary
artillery of the family, was quite seasick on
the voyage to this continent. “Hop” felt its
pulse soon after it got its shore legs, and I
hear the Liebling Strad. is now in the pink
of condition.
‘'“Musical Crank” sends me this:
Beethoven lovers had a much more satisfy-
ing afternoon at the Town Hall on Saturday
than any of the tens of thousands who went
rorth to see a reed shaken by the wind at
Ascot. Joseph Bradley hasn’t yet been able
to sufficiently repress the brasses of the Sym-
phony Orchestra; but in the Heroic Sym-
phony—written around Napoleon’s latter end
—there was not a thing to complain of; and
after the beautiful pianissimo passages in the
second movement, Beethoven worshippers
would have been quite content to have gone
home and nursed their emotions. There were
other fine things, among them the great
V\ agnerian Iluldigungs March,’ composed to

color.
The Tragedy of No Transport (the same old
tragedy of the tram system round about this
congested port) was in full blast at 5 p.m. on
Saturday. Ascot was the place in which
thousands of citizens wore some of the lea-
ther off their soles looking for the special
trams. Ihese cars evidently belonged to the
len Lost Tribes of the Tramway Depart-
ment. It is noteworthy that ten tribes were
lost out of twelve. But the Department
improved on that, and lost eleven trams out
of twelve. When Hart made his restored-
to-animation biplane whir towards the sky,
the. hills of Botany Bay were indigo blue
against the darkening sky. Crowds poured
out of the grounds of Ascot racecourse after
an afternoon of much waiting. One small
car, black with human ants, crawled slowly
along the line. It was the last df its kind. -
A crowd being very much like a mob of
sheep, and with as much individuality, we
followed a few leaders. Their plan of cam-
paign was to stalk the Lost Specials by walk-
ing along the Botany-road towards La Per-
ouse- _ln cold blood one can see that the obvi-
ous thing was to tramp towards Sydney, in the
nope Ending a car or ambushing that kind
of hired vehicle that grows near the rim of
Waterloo. Instead, we walked away towards
the coming night. Never the ghost of a tram
light flickered on that long black road. One
cab came along, dragged by the final horse of
the world. Scores of people tried to get in-
side it at the same moment. Twenty tried
to get on the roof. Forty-five tried to get on
the horse. Seventy tried to hang on and run
behind. And seventy-five called the driver
eighty different animals because his cab was
only one cab instead of a whole cab-rank.
As we got nearer to La Perouse, the dark
roadside was thick with those who had fallen
by the way, and sat down firmly with their
feet in the gutter waiting to be removed by
the specials they had read about in the morn-
ing papers. When we were near the smell
seaweed that mingles with the perfume
of Botany’s bone-mills, an ancient inhabi-
tant blinked at the Ascot pilgrims over the
edge of her fence. We read her countenance
by the uncertain light of a small kerosene
lamp that filtered through an open door. It
was full of pity, mixed with contempt. The
ancient remarked that no trams had gone on
to Perouse terminus, so she supposed there
were none waiting there. “But if yous want
to find special” (scornful sniff) “trams, yous
might find ’em by now at Bay-street, Bot-
any.” “A pram’d do me, missus,” said a thin
man who was carrying a large, fat child,
and dragging another by the fist. She shut
the door. We returned to Botany. Reached
Sydney about 7.20 p.m. Never want to see
an Ascot aeroplane race again. There’s too
much tram-hunting in its anti-climax.
Ascot raised a small cheer on Saturday
afternoon, when a woman exhibitor of a
model flier climbed the fence that divided
the grandstand enclosure from the flat. Her
narrow skirt made a rapid bolster descent
without any indiscreet revelations of stock-
ing. This enterprising dame’s model ’plane
won the race for aero miniatures, and dashed
over a swan-haunted pond like a toy blizzard.
A biplane such as that in which Australian
Hart didn’t race American Stone the other
day (in the presence of a great multitude), is
an awkward-looking beast to imitate a bird.
It rises from the earth with the noise of an
Eveleigh engine workshop, and rather re-
sembles a young and frivolous showground
booth, gone aloft on the wings of a wild agri-
cultural cyclone. Hart got his air-beater
going nicely with a dull roar from its internals
It made a circled swoop, then fainted quietly
away behind a green knoll. Though Hart’s
machine soared later on, the day was done.
Stone’s monoplane is a perfect lady, with a
neat waist and gauzy angel sleeves,' or some-
thing like the wings of a great horse-stinger
fly. She flirted with the tree-tops and seemed
too rapid for words. Both aviators declared
the weather to be full of angry blasts in the
upper si'irey, so the crowd departed to search
the horizon for the Lost Trams.
Yours at the tired end of a tram-tramp.
VANDORIAN.
The Oriental Hotel.
The Oriental Hotel, in Collins Street,
Melbourne, is growing up. It has sprouted
and towered like Jack’s Beanstalk. A solid
block of several storeys is planted in the
rear, looking insolently over the top, while
arms or wings fold the old tavern in an
enveloping embrace. The roof is a modern
marvel. One small section is a space roomy
enough for an aeroplane landing; meantime,
it is designed for tennis or bowls until the
air creature becomes more numerous. Then
there is a series of open-air courts (still on
the roof), carefully sheltered for roof gardens
and lounges. Also, still on the roof, are
open air bedrooms —solid tents walled off
from the roof garden, but with an outlook
over river and river banks, Botanical Gard-
ens and distant red roofs, sheer to the sea
and its boats.
The ground space indulges in like luxury.
Special supper rooms and cafe have a special
entrance from Collins Street, and open on
to a grass terrace at the back. The terrace
wanders into a garden (in the heart of the
expensive city), full of roses and old-
fashioned flowers. Owner Tewkesbury’s wife
has lived all her mornings for many moons
encouraging these flowers and helping the
mere man gardener curse the carpenters.
Bound this garden is a 20ft. high, wire-
netted fence. Climbing roses have already
mounted 10ft. with much enthusiasm. More
nimble nasturtiums are being sooled on to the
race to flaunt temporary color, while the
roses get in good, solid, serious lasting work.
That caf6 is Dutch; such a darling. Heavy
hardwood rafters on a white ceiling and
dreams of Dutch scenes —all misty blues and
browns and greens on course canvas —let into
the walls. Table linen, bordered with Dutch
blue, and the waitresses’ duplicates of Hunt-
ley’s “Three Little Maids” in Dutchness.
There is a new dining-room, lofty as a
dome, pannelled in Queensland oak, and hung
with cream leather. In the heart of this
nest of feeding rooms is a cunning little
Winter Garden—turquoise green in tone and
French enough to be a room of Ninon
l’Enclos, that fascinatingly naughty woman
who went artistically crazy on turquoise
blues and greens, wore her complexion blonde
and hid her wrinkles under her instep.
The new square block of buildings has
four flats of bedrooms. Each whole floor
kneels to one color scheme, and is carpeted
throughout with the same pattern. A blue
floor; a rose-colored floor; another one
green—the last brown._ Guests can choose
a room to match their complexions. An
hotel clerk de luxe laid on to study eyes
would be an inspiration. “Blue eyes, madam,
and fluffy hair,” he would mutter sotto voce.
“I’ll put you in a rose-colored suite.” His
color sense would be perfect. He’d pick out
a room on the tan-brown flat for the tawny-
haired traveller. What a boon ! The dust
of motor-train and boat would cease to irri-
tate. After a bath, anyhow. The baths in
this luxurious tavern ! Some cost £5O apiece.
Glass screens and every kind of warm spray
and shower carefully tempered to the taste
of the tired Venus or Adonis lucky enough
to perch in this haven.
Maryann is to be treated like Dresden
China. She need not be plentiful—the rooms
are so self-helpful. Every room its own
vacuum cleaner attached to a submerged and
comprehensive setting of tubes. Each room
its hot and cold water on tap in marble
basins. Each room its own telephone (glory
be to Allah, Melbourne has it at last!), and a
bath to every two ordinary bedrooms, most
rooms have their own exclusive tub adjacent,
while the special suites of bath, bed and sit-
ting rooms are millionaire luxuries.
The new building has two miles of new
carpet £2OOO guid. Boches, Melbourne,, are
furnishing.
Kitchens ! —beloved heart of taverns !—are
being built under the eye of Chef Middle-
ton. He is watching hundreds of pounds
spread in luxury for him. An oven like a
large size billiard table was put in by Gather
and Klerr, local makers. It is intersected
and dissected in a way that a switch can
heat or cool any section. Side sprints in
ovens for special food decorate the building.
An ice room and a hot room are gigantic
thermos quarters. Two avenues to the feed-
ing rooms are fixed for the Waiter Going and
the Waiter Coming.*

MANY English and American books of architectural designs have
found their way to Australia, but, upon examination, they have
failed because they were not suitable to our climate.
To meet a long-felt want this series of 78 elevations and 78 plans,
specially designed for Australian environment, has been published, and
should be of signal service to those about to build, whether it be the
modest week-end bungalow or the more pretentious suburban villa.
Descriptions accompany each plan, and . cuirent prices aie
quoted in the estimates, so that, with this book as a guide, one cannot go
far wrong.
Whilst the designs are varied and picturesque, the main idea has
been to produce plans that give the maximum of comfort health and
beauty at the minimum of cost.
Instead of having to decide the all-important question of a home
from a few rough sketches, you may take time to examine and compare
these 78 well-thought-out and carefully-prepared plans, drawn to scale
and exact in evety detail.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, June 17, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Some call him Baden Powell; others make
it Baden Pole; and there are some who say
Baden Pool, mouthing the second part till it
makes a perfect rhyme to “Fool.” Any-
how, Baden, without his bashed hat, wan-
dered on to the large, dreary platform of
the Town Hall, where a blank white picture
sheet patiently awaited him. Something—
possibly it was the sheet —made a mocking
echo. Chief Justice Madden, strewing
flowers of speech before the Pretender—no,
the Defender of Mafeking—was bothered in-
cessantly by the sound of his own voice—a
most unusual thing. The Chief Broomhandle
suffered to a less extent. The balconies were
packed with small, shrill boys, who cheered
at every opportunity, * and warmed
themselves with the fires of enthu-
siasm, while a numebr of very im-
portant people, military and otherwise,
gradually froze to the heels in the
front chairs. A draught which would have
propelled a full-rigged ship at about 12
knots fluttered the ostrich feather decora-
tions of the women and poured down the
starched necks of the men till they looked
blue and dispirited. The management had
indulged in a barrack-like severity of bare
boards, consequently there was not even a
strip of carpet whereon to rest a numbed
foot. A couple of vice-regal chairs remained
empty till the flowery John descended and
• composed himself in one of them. A girl
guide presented the Chief with a much-
ribboned bouquet. As soon as possible, he
handed the pretty things over to a black-
coated Help, who marched off stiffly with
the ribbons blowing over his manly shoul-
ders. Then he set to, and the lantern man
got busy. Picture after picture flashed on
to the screen, and a large, complacent voice
rolled forth such remarks as: “Lion killed
by ME,” “An Outrider—one of MY
sketches.” I waited hopefully, but in vain,
for “Mafeking stamp—MY head on it.”
The most striking thing about Baden
Powell is his large, serviceable voice, which
he doubtless strengthened by his zeal for
private theatricals, ere he undertook his
fine fat part at the Mafeking. Hippodrome.
His reiteration of the word “scout” is a
good dramatic effect. He suits the accent
to the word, and clothes with a sense of
dignity every barelegged nipper in the audi-
ence. After he had done liis turn at the
Town Hall, on Thursday night, and Fuller
had repeated himself most tiresomely, the
vice-regal party fled in two mustard-tin
motors, Auntie Phipps sharing the second
with two blue-edged Helps. An amusing
item of the audience, by the way, was a neat
brunette girleen with a severely boyish hair-
cut. She came under the wing of an elderly
mommer, and a long evening cloak pro-
claimed her sex.. Presumably the close-
cropped damsel is a boy-scout imperson-
atress.
The Liberal League Club, now a two-year-
old, last week shifted ceremoniously to the
expensive flat deserted by the overgrown
Quamby. President Mrs. Deakin was absent
from the function, owing to the serious ill-
ness of her mother; but Alfred himself came
along and spoke bravely amidst a wilder-
ness of spreading hats. Mrs. Fred Eggle-
ston and Mrs. Herbert Brookes both made
speeches, and Mrs. Knox (who used to be
heiress Kathleen McPherson, before she
married the politician’s son) left a seven-
weeks’ old baby to come along and help.
(Hereabouts seems a good place to mention
that anyone who talks politics with a
peaches-and-cream complexion from under a
saucy white Grebe hat ig bound to be a
success, whatever views she advances.)
Miss Murray was another woman who con-
tributed some remarks. In business hours,
she looks after babies in a wholesale way
as a Government inspector. Mrs. Isaacs
fluttered busily amongst the crowd, and
showed the new delights of the improved
quarters. A tea party happened later in
the Mia Mia downstairs. Pasteboards for
same were doled out by a cherry-frocked
maiden, and, armed with these, members
and their friends were enabled to secure
muffins and tea.
Ambrose Patterson, the much-travelled
artist brother of the commercial Pattersons,
has been working busily of late, and the re-
sults are brightening the walls of the Athen-
aeum. Ambrose is a warm champion of the
newest Parisian art, which calls for light
and color all the time. Buyers are breaking
out in red spots among the exhibits, so ap-
parently cheerfulness pays in Art, as else-
where. Harper Bell has carried off a prize
in a delightful glimpse of quiet Williams-
town, where the artist found material for
one or two other fine little pictures. A
stray bright-green English common con-
trasts well with the more sombre Australian
tints. Toorak keeps wandering in and out
to an encouraging rustle of falling leaves
(cheque book variety). The two big pic-
tures of Henley—impressive spectacles by
day and night—are once more on view.
Sundry alterations to the picture of Henley
by Day are improvements in every case. As
for Henley by Night, which was gathered
to Abrahams’ bosom (the bosom of Mr.
Laurie Abrahams) on the first day of the
show, it is a revelation of the Importance of
being Properly Hung. Last year, the same
picture was on show on the same wall, and
because it was “skied,” the effect of its
daring treatment was only half appreciated.
I eople couldn’t break their necks sufficiently
to get the full strength of the scheme. It
had a surface appearance of color riot. Now
that it hangs on the line, Henlev by Fire-
works reveals itself as a well-ordered pre-
sentation of the real thing.
Lilydale feels ropeable re its lively dance,
which hopped successfully in the local hall,
last Friday. Melba was billed as star
hostess, but telephoned 10 minutes or so
before the reception hour to an agonised
committee stating that she was dog-tired,
she had been entertaining Baden Powell all
day, and was too fatigued to venture out.
Melbourne dancers who motored there and
back say the affair survived the blow, and
developed into a charming country dance.
Mrs. Charlie Mitchell left a beauteous recol-
lection in the mind of everybody by reason
of the dress she wore —an orange-colored
sunset gown like a Pauline inspira-
tion. Mrs. Arthur Syme was one of
/r e hostesses, and Mrs. McAlister
(Lucy Syme of yore) also helped wel-
come the people. The flower-valley is a
stronghold of the Symes, and pretty Mrs.
Leoff motored up and made an agreeable
reinforcement of the garrison. The dance,
for a wonder, was not lopsided, the cheerful
Charlie Mitchell tirelessly goading his fel-
low men to take the floor, instead of herd-
mg together and setting fire to tobacco in
secluded places.
The Repertory Theatre Club continues its
careful literature sampling. At next week’s
meeting, in the Austral Salon, G. H.
lynibbs is to lecture on “Goethe’s Concep-
turn of Mephistopheles”—a nice warm sub-
ject for this cold r foggy weather.
St. Kilda set a highly spectacular mayoral
ball rolling, last week. It is the fashion
now at big dances to have promenades, pro-
cessions and dignified special square dances,
all of which take up time and floor space,
and crowd the young dancers out until the
evening is advanced. The St. Kilda Town
Hall, though outwardly a raw, unplastered
pile, is a fine place inside. The domed ceil-
ing was screened like a circus tent with
banners of roses, and the trail of Bagdad
was visible in the green and bronze lanterns.
A raised platform was crammed with the
suburban peerage. Mayor Hughes, in a fear-
-111 ™ rr y state, and his Mayoress, in smart
black and white, graciously received the
bows and bobs of their liege subjects on the
elevated place. The John Madden dame,
who is a citizeness of the seaside realm,
stayed away, but sent her apologies by red-
coated Guy and daughter Lesly, who was
sombrely frocked in black. General Gordon
(who has recently taken up his abode at the
St. Kilda road headquarters) waltzed in the
military fashion of yesterday, with the arm
of his partner stretched straight ahead. One
embarrassed damsel made an effort to de-
press her arm; but it shot out like a piston
rod at the next revolution, and badly scared
some amazed flappers. Parson Hughes, of
St. Peter’s, who belongs to the family, gave
his moral support to the frivol. He is a
sociable cleric, and did not even shun the
Terrible /Trousers function, where he
squatted like a Turk at the supper and re-
frained from crying out “Woe!” or “Alas!”
Burston, the ex-Gaud Mayor, and his wife
also haunted the function. Miss Mackay
looked dazzling in a filmy frock the color of
ripe rock-melon heart. A beauty girl in the
party conducted, by Billy Williams was con-
tained by a maize-colored ninon, into which
she had been packed by hydraulic pressure
—at least, that is the only wav I can
account for the perfect fit. Perhaps she
was boiled to soften her, and then inserted
before she “set” again. The special item of
the evening was the debutantes’ dance.
About e>o buds arrayed in pure white were
led round in twos by self-conscious youths,
while, a limelight man away up in the roof
did his best to throw colored beams on them.
His efforts were only partly successful. One
of the nicest blossoms was Miss Brunning,
daughter of the seedsman. At 10 o’clock
the supper room was carried by storm, and
the victuals put to the teeth.
The officers of the Fifth Australian In-
fantry Regiment are requesting the pleasure
of a lot of people for Friday, June 21, the
longest night of the whole year. The soci-
ety kittens and cats are falling over them-
selves in the rush for cards. Lieutenant
Henry is secretary of the heart-breaking
affair, which will happen in the Prahran
Town Hall.
The. first of the Hyams pupils’ dances
for this season had a gay and friskv hap-
pening at All Saints’ Hall, St. Kilda, on
the 13th. A number of former pupils of
the Hyams sisters, were responsible for the
arrangement of a series of hops, and a strong
committee worked with a will to make the
opening event a success. It was boyful and
joyful. The next is fixed for Thursday,
July 11.
The Art students, who break out every
winter in a masked ball frenzy, have fixed
upon the glorious fourth of July (every good
Yank calls it Julie) as the date for their
annual spree. The Turn Verein Hall will
be the scene of the amiable lunacy.
. Mayor Enabling, of P’ran, cancelled his
civic ball, promised for July 2, on account
of the death of his father, but local society
was not to be baulked of its frivol. The
ratepayers of that suburban city have ar-
ranged a hop on their own for the date
aforesaid, the profits to be given to the
building fund of the Prahran and South
xarra Crbche. The Mayoress has offered to
contribute the music and incidental printing
expenses.
The youngest of the Jarrard sisters (the
others, by the way. are all married) has
become engaged to Clive Fairbairn, son of
George of that ilk.
Dr. Mary Booth has resigned her billet
with the Victorian Government for health
reasons. The energetic worker has had
two good offers of employment in neighbor-
ly States, but is prescribing a holiday for
herselt before she says yea or nay to any
proposition. She departed on Wednesday for
Bananaland for an irresponsible wander
and a complete rest in the wonderful north-
ern climate.
The Weedon wedding caused a mild stir in
some circles. The high contracting parties
were the son of the photographic knight
and the daughter of Dr. Henry. Dr. Strong,
the Australian Church, went out to Illira,
.t* Hilda (the home of the Ilenrys), and
tied the knot carefully at five o’clock. Later,
the wedding party motored into dinner at
X aris Caffi, and, subsequently, there was a
reception in the upper rooms. Collins-strect
was brightened for several foggy hours by
the whirring of lighted motors, and the
hurrying to and fro of wedding guests. The
bride, a dainty figure in cream velvet, cut
ankle-short, got along without bridesmaids.
Xier brother, Lieutenant Henry, supported
the groom. The honeymoon is being mooned
away in Sydney.
Natural hair (that is to say, home-grown
mur) makes the best stage wigs look cheap.
The fascinating little Onelli, who is the
third of Hoffmann’s operatic loves, has a
silky-brown, well-groomed mane, obviously
her own, which she wears coiled on hex-
pretty neck.
Elsie Hall’s pianoforte recital at the Town
Hall was a deadly cold experience for the
~UU or out) enthusiasts who came to do honor
a? ~ e sifted artist. Poor Elsie’s luck in
Melbourne has never been good. This time
it was cruel. The Quinlan opera boom had
carried away most of the audience that might
have been hers, and in her simple white dress
she cut a pathetic figure of loneliness. Ap-
plause was a genuine expression of feeling
from people who were glad of the chance to
warm their extremities. When they were
not banging their hands together, or stamping
their feet, they mostly coughed and sneezed,
and at 20 p.m. they rushed home to rub
liniment on their chests. The Town Hall
or, rather, the concert hall part of it —is a
pneumonia trap at this time o’ year, and if
Board of Health were to prosecute the
Gity bathers for trying to lure their chil-
dren into one of the worst ills that flesh is
heir to, the sentence would be something

Olive Godwin spent three or four days in
Melbourne absorbing operatic hints at Her
Majesty’s, and left for England last
Wednesday. J. C. Williamson and Hugh
Hard are sending her off to the other side
to have a look at things. They count her a
very clever Austi-alienne, who only needs
a wander round to put her amongst the top-
notchers.
Mrs. Rumor again credits a large thea-
trical dame with having captured the heart
and booked the hand of an enterprising pic-
ture showman. The alleged engagement has
not yet been called from the roof garden.
Another outburst of the same unreliable
person is to the effect that a tall stage lady,
who had planned a foreign tour, decided at
the eleventh hour to accept a matrimonial
engagement _ hereabouts. The foreign tour
meanwhile is postponed or something.
A small, howling Oscar Asche and a
pocket edition Lily Brayton were lately
added to the population at the Woman’s
Hospital. They are a fine pair of mixed
twins, and are bearing up well.
The Quinlan grand opera people are keep-
ing the box office busy, even the matinees
getting packed houses. Opera and supper,
with discussion to follow, is the favorite
recreation of the Best People at the moment.
On Saturday, Society had its afternoon tea
in Her Majesty’s lounge, where black-haired
girls with cherry ribbons in their caps hand
round the desirable home-made cakes. In
the theatre, “Hansel and Gretel’’ shared the
bill with “The Prodigal Son.” The Prodigal,
wrapped in a black hearthrug, had a mag-
nificent oratorio welcome home; but the
fatted calf (edible variety) was not visible.
Also, the family manifested no desire to lay
the table, preferring to stand round and
sing at the recovered son in a way that no
really hungry husk-chewen could stand.
Agnes Nicholls was an impressive, bare-
armed mother in purple. When she fell on
the neck of her returned son, various un-
worthy sporting persons who haunt the
ringside, sat up and muttered “Break!”
“Hansel and Gretel” is a musical fairy tale
for grown-up children. The pretty Onelli
girl made a graceful Gretel with two aston-
ishing plaits of glossy hair. She looked
quite small as Antonia, in “The Tales,” but
in this affair she positively loomed. Rosina
Beynon made a plump and pleasing Hansel,
in a blue smock, and sang like an angel in
disguise. She has a cheeky, mischievous
laugh, which is absurdly boyish, and it drew
an answering guffaw from the house every
time.
The boxes were packed with the Very
Best People, who, immediately the show was
over, bundled into their motors and splashed
home through the pouring rain to dress in
hot haste for the evening performance.
Chauffeurs have been simply seething with
rage at the rushes entailed by the opera
co. Some of the performances begin at 7.30,
and that entails more hustling than the oil

remarked to a peevish, half-fed crew of
guests: “That ? s nothing; in Germany some

noon.” Society may yet be driven to bring
its hamper and carve the cold fowl in .the

Jansen, the slim and bright-eyed conjurer
with the dazzling hands, had" a bumper
house at the Town Hall, on Saturday. At
the Collins-street side entrance, an early
crowd of two-bobbers (I mean many people
who paid two bob —not two people who
paid a bob each) waited patiently in the
rain, and the new lounge entrance echoed
with the cries of folk whose money had been
pushed back at them with a regretful hand-
wave. So dense was the audience that the
fierce draughts which inhabit our hall of the
winds had not room to get in any deadly
work. Some of the Most Expensive People
sat in the front rows; amongst them were
Harpers and McKinnons from Toorak, and
others of equal tonnage, who had managed
to evade the grand opera and the new Asche
show. General _ Gordon, with his martial
cloak around him, conversed with a few
mayors and a terrace of generals. Jansen's
clothes are an agreeable feature of his en-
tertainment. One girl declared that she in-
tends to obtain the pattern of his beautiful
stock collar for her tailor-mades.

The University Ball occurred on Thursday even-
ing at the Elder Conservatorium, which is a way
this function has had in the past. There was an
exception to the old rule last year. The Places of
Public Entertainment Act, or something drastic, got
in the way, and demanded that the hall should get
itself licensed if it wanted to be danced in, and
the University considered a license beneath its dig-
nity. '1 he thing made it feel like a threepennv
cigar divan. However, it either swallowed its dignity
or evaded the license, and celebrated its return to its
own domain by making what is usually an excellent
floor as heavy as a bride’s first scone. Government
House and various chancellors and vice-chancellors
shed their patronage on the affair, and the distraught
hosts looked wildly and perseveringly to the needs
of 30 debutantes and their other guests.
Mrs. Wordsworth James, she who patented “Cooee”
as a password, and has it gold-emblazoned on every-
thing, from carpet slippers to vanity-boxes, has
departed to Vancouver for' a brief visit. Her mis-
sion is to take to her son, who is living there, his
prospective bride, who hails from Queensland. She
(Mrs. Janies) is one of the Crabbe family of vour
city. ■ -
Mrs. Fraser and her prettv daughter, who were

The S.P.C.A. had its annual meeting on Monday
last. The Governor occupied the chair, and some
stirring tales were told of animal wrongs redressed
and human brutality punished. The society has
doubled its membership in the past year, anil now
boasts a bank balance of about £4 00.
“The Blue Bird” was responsible for at least
one vast theatre party. The Michael Hawkers filled
up rows of seats in the dress circle on Tuesday even-
ing—from which smiled the Leonard Bakewells,
Tom Barr Smiths, Hopes, Frank Downers, Miss
Bosnnquet, Captain Fletcher and others.
The Alliance Francaise met at the May Club on
Thursday evening, to polish up its French. Mrs.
Gautier, who has been imported from Paris to pound

The South Australian Kindergarten Union gave a
demonstration in the Exhibition Building on Satur-
day. Lady Bosnnquet and a huge troop of children
watched the ceremony, and pronounced it good.
Crowds surged to Cheltenham for the Port Races
on Saturday.
The Adelaide Hunt Club made an early start

POLITICAL
POINTS
Recent attempts to consolidate the
“United” Labor party and the Federation of
Labor in Maoriland have failed. The latter
body has decided to bring itself more in line
with the organising methods of the Indepen-
dent Workers of the World, and Professor
W. T. Mills, the chief dispenser of glad tid-
ings for the other side, has only this to say
about the matter :
The only thing that characterises the 1.W.W., as a
form of organisation distinct from other factors in
the Labor movement, is its tactics, which involve
every possible crime against the social order, and the
power to do harm to the working class.
The back kick from the Federation was a
motion to communicate with all Labor organ-
isations throughout the world “the attempt
on, the part of the alleged Labor advocate,
W. T. Mills, to spread dissent and disunity in
the ittU'is of organised Labor at a time when
they were confronted with a united enemy.”
So brotherly love continues. In fact, it con-
tinues like the very devil.
From a desperate correspondent: —
Under the guidance of Andrew Fisher, the Aus-
tralian threatens to develop into a person who will
earn a precarious living by directing his fellow-Aus-
tralian to the nearest pub. Andrew has done nothing
much towards helping him to start manufactures in
the congested cities, and very little in the way of
assisting him to the Territory. Andrew supports
general strikes, approves of borrowing, thinks sol-
diering a job for half-grown boys, rather likes Fed-
eral railways that double out of Federal territory
like pursued hares, doesn’t mind a capital city with
no water frontage and little water supply, looks on a
high Protective tariff as a suitable fit for a pigeon-
hole, respectfully receives and acts on the advice of
his sworn enemies, and generally blows down the
corridors of Time in a light and graceful fashion,
like the silky seed of his national vegetable. Aus-
tralia has been afflicted with too much of the feather-
weight type of Prime Minister. 1 sometimes wonder
whether Fisher wouldn’t be-a more satisfactory person
if he wore two bricks in his tail pocket.
THE EXPANSION.
Speaking at Lithgow on Monday night, Mr. Joseph
Cook said the cost of running Australia was
£20,000,000 higher than five years ago.
COOK : “ You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Why, when you wuz even years old you
wuz livin' on far less."
AUST. : “But, you see, I grew since then, and
I'm able to earn more and eat more."
COOK : “Oh, I never thought of that."
Why, by way of a pleasant and harmless
gamble, should not Australia try the lottery
loan? The municipality of Paris recently
borrowed £4,000,000 for new gasworks. It
was assumed that 3f per cent, was a fair
thing, but the actual interest is fixed at 3
per cent. The other f per cent, (about
£30,000 a year) provides an annual flutter
for the bond'holders, the biggest prize being
£8000. The combination of thrift and flutter
makes this kind of loan amazingly popular.
WAS A COMPLETE CRIPPLE.
Mr. Charles Lincoln, of Richmond, Tas., was a
complete cripple with muscular rheumatism, and could
not get about. He started using Chamberlain’s
Pain Balm, and after a few applications the pains
were easier and soon left him altogether. He is now
well, is 52 years of age, and earning his living as a
general laborer. We hope that sufferers from Rheu-
matism will not need further evidence in regard to
this liniment.*
From Frank Croson :
The big Australian can get some joy out of the
spectacle of the little Victorian State Frighters stew-
ing in their own gravy. The Commonwealth was
willing to take on the whole work of inducing and
procuring immigration, but the jealous Slates, dread-
ing that the arrangement might pull out another
one or tvvo of their proud tail feathers, would have
none of it. Now they are lamenting because, when
they have got the immigrants, the immigrants will
disregard border-lines which they can’t see, and
wouldn’t have any respect for if they could see.
One Edwin A. Pratt has just published in
London, in Murray’s “Questions of the Day”
series, a book on “The State Railway Muddle
in Australia.” The thing is “an attack on
the ownership and management of railways
by the State.” There is a railway muddle
in Australia; but Private Enterprise and
not the State was responsible for it. It was
in the days before State ownership arrived
that N. S. Wales adopted one gauge, while
Victoria adopted another; and that bulks
more in the railway muddle than all the
other ingredients put together. But Pratt
is pretty certain not to put that saddle on
the right horse.
The Health Act Amending Bill which
Premier Watt is bringing before the Vic.
Assembly will, if fearlessly administered,
completely defeat the up-country municipal
potentate who breaks the health laws and
escapes the consequences because he is what
he is. Watt’s idea is to substitute for the
present Health Board, control by a permanent
head, who will act on the advice of the chief
medical officer. The scheme further provides
for division of the State into six sections,
each in charge of a medical officer who will
do the work now more or less perfunctorily
or completely neglected by municipal officials.
The goat in the path of this reform will be
the furious opposition of municipal poten-
tates. No mayor, however dirty, is ever pro-
secuted under the present system by his
own subordinate, and even a partially clean
mayor will dislike the advent of a new
officer who can prosecute him with impunity.
A GLASS OF WINE WITH CAESAR BORGIA.
“My experience,” continued Mr. Wade, “has been one of gross humiliation. 1 have been goaded by in-
sults from the Chair to retort, so there might be an excuse for giving me my walking ticket, but rather
than give the Speaker that opportunity to chuck me out, I swallowed the humiliation:’’
CÆSPAR BORGIA WILLIS : “ Quickly, notv ; what's it to be—the Cup or the Chuck ? ”
DISPIRITED COURTIER WADE : “ P-p-please, Noble Signor, the Cup."
The Colonial Sugar Trust is not the only
one that defies a Royal Commission. Re-
cently, the M.L. Government appointed a
Commission to get to the bottom of the leap-
ing proclivities of food prices, but when it
arrived at Dunedin a number of wholesale
merchants despatched a Gent. One to in-
form it that they had decided to treat the
subpoenas issued to them with much scoff.
So far as they were concerned, no informa-
tion about food-leaping was obtained. As in
the case of the Sugar Co. at Sydney, the
Commission reported the matter to “the
proper authorities.” Commissions seem to
take for their motto: “Distant axes look the
sharpest.”
Ever since Labor member Poynton,
M.H.R., was first elected, 11 years ago, he
has gone back to Parliament for Grey (S.A.)
without opposition, although most of his con-
stituents are farmers. This time, however,
the Liberal Union is putting up “a pro-
ducer” (McDonald) against him. Port Pirie
will give Poynton at least 1500 votes to the
good, but Northern and West Coast cockies
may be able to wipe out that advantage.
The railway from Port Augusta to the West-
ralian border* runs through Poynton’s dis-
trict, and if there are a few hundred navvies
at work there next April they may turn the
scale.
S.A. Liberal Union has come to a definite
disagreement with ’Siah Symon, and if that
Senator stands for re-election he will have
to run as an Independent, otherwise he won’t
sit. He can hardly join the Laborites for a
number of reasons, though he approves of
much of their Federal legislation. ’Siah
headed the poll in 1901 and again in 1910.
His years are threescore and six, but even at
that age he has the best-paying law practice
in Adelaide, and loses more money by neg-
lecting it for politics than any other S.A.
politician.
“B.”: A characteristic example of the
cheeky way in which “Liberalism” tries to
pull the public’s leg is afforded in the
assaults made by the S. M. Herald and the
Telegraph and C. G. Wade on H. D.
Morton, M.L.A., for the alleged offence of
“ratting” on the Wade party. For the
purposes of their yarn, it is, of course, re-
presented that Morton was elected by the
Hastings and Macleay (N.S.W.) constitu-
ency as a Liberal. He never was. Labor
opposed him with Hugh Bridson; and Lib-
eralism opposed him like the very devil with
Robert Davidson and an army of orators,
from Jock Garland downwards. Yet C. G.
Wade and the rest go on claiming Morton
with the utmost nerve, and pointing out that
had he but been “true to his party,” they
would be in power to-day. There should be
some legal redress against the reckless asso-
ciation of innocent persons with a cause like
Wadeism, as constituting a grave reflection
on the victim’s intellect —something as
though he was accused of habitually associat-
ing. as a matter of preference, with a dead
camel.
At a meeting of the backbone of the coun-
try held at Sea Lake (Vic.), a resolution
was carried:—
No matter if rain sufficient to give the wheat crops
a good start does fall within a reasonable period,
such cannot possibly cause the grass to grow in time
to ensure feed for stock during the winter. We
therefore unanimously agree to request the Govern-
ment to undertake such reproductive public works
in the districts affected as shall enable the farmers
to find employment for their teams and themselves.
Thus does the gentle agriculturist, who
loathes Socialism, turn to Sosh at the very
commencement of his hour of need.
“H. Singemoine”: A writer in Sydney
Watchman emitted the following eerie cry
of grief last week: —
“Australia Day” is madness and mockery enough
in itself, but what have you to say when I tell you
one of our own Public Schools was flying the Aus-
tralian flag on Empire Day and not the Union Jack?
When a public servant with the supposed amount of
loyalty, truth and fear of his God will dare to allow
a religious sentiment to draft out of him all that is
worth keeping in, and wave the Australian flag in
preference to the Union Jack over the heads of hun-
dreds of Protestants, proud to call themselves mem-
bers of the British Empire, I can tell you, anger and
downright sorrow for the future of Australia are the
only feelings one has.
What will the writer of the above have to
say, I wonder, when I tell him the. plain
truths (1) that in England, the home of the
Union Jack, no flag of any sort waves over
the Board or public schools on Empire Day ;
(2) that no official notice is taken anywhere
in the United Kingdom of Meath’s blither-
some festival; and (3) that Asquith,
Britain’s Protestant Prime Minister, has
coldly declined, from his seat in Parliament,
to give any more national countenance to
Empire Day than to Guy Fawkes Day. Pro-
bably when the facts in regard to Britain’s
noisome disloyalty to its own flag and faith
are fully borne in on him, he will inconti-
nently burst —which will, perhaps, be all to
the good.
As a result of a violent public agitation, Vic-
toria’s Receiving Home for Neglected Chil-
dren, at Royal Park, Melbourne, is to be
attended to with the gloves off. A scandal-
ised public now learns that the Weary Gov-
ernment, months ago, received a report on
the matter so scarifying that it did not pub-
lish it. The same Government is still in
office, and its Chief Secretary is still the
same Weary.
A BRITISH JOKE.
“Cheer up , Mister. Why don't yer get things
working and prepare y'r own tucker and
feel satisfied and independent ?”
“Go 'way, go 'way, my boy. Don't yer dare
interfere with other people's principles. I
believes in a little loaf, I do."
At latest advices, 100 niggers are to resolve
whether Taft or Roosevelt shall be the Re-
publican candidate for the U.S. Presidency.
The other delegates to the party convention
have decided. The 300 niggers, like Norman
Cameron, of Tasmania, hold the balance, and
they are eating the food, and drinking the
drinks, and burning the cigars of both
parties, and bursting with provender and im-
portance. Also, they are presumably being
bribed. And when the 100 Jack Johnsons
meet to consult, the political pride and glory
of George Washington’s country fixes its ear
at the keyhole, and tries to find out what
Sambo is saying.
Last Sunday was set aside by the N.S.W.
Government as a special day of Thanksgiv-
ing for the rain. It was much cheaper to
do it this way than to send out circulars to
every Cohen, at home and abroad, notifying
that things were all right again.
THE REAR GUARD.
To obviate any repetition of the accident to the
cadets of a few'days ago, the Adjutant-General has
been instructed to prepare some scheme to safeguard
companies at night.— Sydney paper.
“D.M.W.’s” call to arms:—
Despite the fact that the Maoriland Ministry is
without a majority in the Parliament, it is on the
edge of an opportunity to make itself secure. It will
have to go to the country, of course, but with the
right war-howl it ought to return with a solid major-
ity. Said howl must be Cessation of Borrowing, and
the time is peculiarly fitting for the announcement.
The regular revenue returns are large. The Advances
to Settlers and Workers Department has almost
reached the point when the repayment of loans will
provide it with sufficient capital to conduct all its
business without further assistance from Cohen.
There can be very little doubt that the cry of Honest
Finance, backed by good solid pledges to. eschew the
tents of Israel for ever, would put new life intn
things political from Auckland to the Bluff. But if
Mackenzie and his crowd go to the people with no-
thing more than a roads-and-bridges policy, it is
more than likely that Massey and his non-aggressive
reactionaries will sweep the polls. The time and
opportunity for heading an attack on Lombardy is at
hand, and Minister Laurenson is the man who would
make a hefty leader. He is the best thinker and
the orator of the Government team. Also, he is
a sound democrat, which is a rare thing in Maori
land politics these days.
A PARAMOUNT OBJECTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Snowball, M.L.A., in responding to the toast
of “Parliament, ” regretted that the lads of the Com-
monwealth, under the compulsory service regulations,
were compelled to drill every Saturday. The cricket
and football clubs should take the matter up, and
have an alteration made, so that these lads might take
part in sports. — News item.
I own the day may yet arrive
When we will have to fight
To save our nationhood, and strive
To keep Australia white;
But 1 regard as too extreme
This military training scheme.
I do not urge that it instills
In youthful minds a lust
For bloody war, or that it fills
A parent with disgust
To know that his unhappy son
Is learning how to use a gun.
The scheme, I grant you, at first sight
May seem most wise and sound,
In practice, though, ’tis proving quite
Unworkable. I’ve found
A flaw that ruins it. In short,
The training interferes with sport t

CURING SKIN
DISORDERS.
Treatment to Purify the Blood is
Required.
Those who suffer with eczema and similar
skin disorders require treatment that will
purify the blood. Timples and rashes always
indicate impurities iu the blood. Sometimes
it will be necessary to restrict the diet,
avoiding rich or greasy foods. It is impor-
ant also to avoid rubbing the skin with
greasy ointments, which may clog the pores
and irritate the complaint. The best blood
purifier is Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They
directly and promptly help to make new,
rich blood, which carries health and healing
throughout the body.
Mr. John Treves, of 522 Nicholson Street,
North Fitzroy, Melbourne, tells how they
cured him of eczema that resisted all other
treatment. He says :
“I noticed my skin getting very fiot and
irritable, and gradually eczema appeared
on my arms, and slowly spread all over
them; and also appeared on the front of the
thighs and the backs of the calves. Nothing
would drive away the trouble. As fast as
one part dried off, the eczema would appear
in another place. It looked very angry and
inflamed. I could hardly bear the bedclothes
to touch the skin, and the perpetual irrita-
tion would be maddening. I could not resist
rubbing and scratching the surfaces, but
they always felt worse afterwards. I spent
a lot of money trying for a cure, but no
ointments would ease me. One day a friend
told me that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills were
a tonic for impoverished blood, so I thought
I would take an internal medicine this time,
and with the third box the skin was cer-
tainly less irritable and burning. I bought
a few more boxes, and presently the patches
grew smaller, and I could notice my blood
was much richer. I kept on till they took
away every vestige of the trouble.
Remember, only the genuine Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills cure. Don’t be gulled into taking
something said to be just as good. Of all
dealers at 2s. fid. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d.:

THE ordinary Cinematograph—as used by showmen —is of no use—rather is it
a great danger—in the home, or we would have introduced the Home Cinemato-
graph before. Electricity is available only in certain places, oil lights cannot be
concentrated, and acetylene or any other form of gas is highly dangerous. As to the
him, no sane person would handle the celluloid film, as used by expert showmen, in
his dining-room.
But the Pathe Home Cinematograph, now successfully produced after
years of experiment by skilled experts, possesses NO disadvantage.
The light is produced from electricity generated in the small magneto (Fig.
lb) as the handle that projects the picture is turned. Thus the machine is abso-
lutely independent of any outside means of lighting, and can be used as successfully
in the camp or country house as in the city house. The light is a small electric
bulb and the magneto cannot get out of control in any circumstances.
Pathe Picture Films will not burn. The only non-inflammable films
are Pathe’s and only, these films can be used in Pathe’s Home Cinematograph. You
can be certain that in no circumstances, no matter how young or how careless the
person who handles them, is there danger of fire. Assuredly, Pathe’s Home Cine-
matograph is a big stride in the right direction.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
There is no need to fall into any flutter
of despair over the 24-run defeat of the Australians
by Lancashire. The kangaroo had got out of ins
bound, that s all. Since luesday evening, May 28,
when the Australian crowd licked South Africa with
an innings and a whole day to spare, the team has
been rusiung up and down Fogland in search of a
civilised wicket and looking for weather fit for a
white man to exist in. it found neither. The
games with Warwick, Middlesex (only an hour of
batting by the county), Cambridge and Yorkshire
were all broken and unfinished, owing to weather,
misery and slush. Then after this multitude of
remnants, Australia met the Cotton County. \et,
on the early hard wicket, it was: Lancashire, 146;
Australia, 177. Sundries, once again, helped the
foe in the first half of the struggle, the County taking
23 extras, and the Continent but 10. In the second
effort the County put up 188, only eight sundries that
time. Of that total, scores of 52 and 40 were
notched by men witii such names as Makepeace and
Whitehead, which shouldn't be allowed under the
rule which deals with “obstructing the field.” Aus-
tralia wanted only 158 to win, but rain delayed the
start for half an hour, and then the field was mud
and the light a glimmer. It was risky to send in
the first usual pair, Kelleway and Jennings, as
Gregory did; the circumstances distinctly calling
for a departure from routine. This fact was demon-
strated when Kelleway, just the man for next day’s
tight corner, was dismissed for eight. Whitty, a
tail-ender, was next man, and played out time with
Jennings. The last day found the wicket soft, and
the bowlers assisted by a gale of wind, and Australia
went down in a game of hit-’em-up—seven of the
remaining nine wickets being caught. Sundries
helped to make the County’s winning margin 24 ; off
the bat it was only nine. Australia has met a lot
of the weather it isn't accustomed to, but that is
all in the game. Macartney’s aggregate of 111 (80
and 31) was a fine performance in such a low scoring
affair. One cannot help wondering why Little Mac.
was not tried with the ball, especially in the second
innings. Our bowlers hit the sticks 10 times; Lan-
cashire's, seven times. On July 4, D.V. and weather
permitting, Australia will meet Lancashire again.
This week, following the return engagement with
Surrey, beaten by seven wickets in May, Gregory’s
team should have another easy victory in Somerset.
It was a slushy tussle in 1909, but Australia got
home by two wickets, mainly by the aid of three
of the present team, Gregory, Macartney and Whitty.
Monday next sees the start of the first match worthy
of the title of Test, Australia v. England. Dave
Smith, the forcing bat who made 84 and 68 for
Victoria against England last November, is the
mystery of the team. He has appeared only twice
so far —two and nine not out against Oxford, and 16
against Warwick. If he is in form and a rod in pickle
for next week’s Test, as many believe, the batting
"will be strengthened, while the dropping of Hazlitt
would still leave the bowling numerous and varied.
With that special reservation the office cricket crank,
who has been attending table-rapping stunts of late,
ventures to prophesy that the teams will be as
follows: —
Australia. England.
Gregory Fry
Bardsley Hobbs
Jennings Warner
Smith (or Hazlitt) Jessop
Macartney Rhodes
Kelleway Douglas
Matthews Snooner
E m erv Woolley
Whitty 1 Foster
McLaren Brearley
Carkeek K. J- Smith
Six of this English team have met Gregory’s men
before for counties or M.C.0., or both, and there s
nothing sensational in the performances of any of
them against Australia this tour. Their batting
averages are:—
Aver-
Trulings. N.O. H.S. Runs. age.
Douglas .. 4 60 193 48.25
Hobbs ..2 81 84 42.00
p ry ..2 35 60 30.00
Spooner .. 4 35 115 28.75
Foster ..2 29 52 26.00
Warner . . 3 1 13 25 12.50
Foster and Douglas are the only two “England”
bowlers sampled by Gregory and Co. before the Test.
For Warwick, Foster bagged seven for 121, average
17.28. For Essex Douglas could manage only two
for 107, and for M.C.C. five for 95 and one for 37 —
in all eight for 239, average 29.87.

On the night of Saturday, June 15, a huge
crowd of admirers assembled at Sargent’s Cafe, Mel-
bourne, to do honor to Peter McAlister, and the
only cricketing body not represented at the function
was the Melbourne Cricket Club. The hall was
packed, and enthusiasm ran high and let itself off
in stirring speeches. After some of the surplus steam
had been blown away, Peter McAlister was pre-
sented with an illuminated address and a wallet
containing £2OO, and cheered again and again. A
feature of the night’s proceedings was the great
reception accorded to E. E. Bean, a Victorian repre-
sentative on the Board of Cricket Control. The
memory of the Insurrection of the Six was strong
in the hall, and Bean poured oil on the troubled
flames by reading a cablegram sent to England before
the Six insurrected, and before the gathering of the
so-called “great citizens’ meeting.” This precious
document read: “Three independent bodies endeavor-
ing to form team under the auspices Melbourne Club.
Interview Marylebone and obtain approval. Public
meeting citizens to be held shortly.” The. reply
received read; “Only team authorised by Board of
Control acceptable.” And an interesting fact is that
the reply was received a few days before the “great
citizens' meeting.” Mr. Bean stated that he is pre-
pared to prove everv word he has uttered on the
matter, and give full particulars if challenged, and
that, in any case, Laver’s pamphlet will be replied
to and refuted. So far this writer has not been
able to get a glimpse of Laver’s pamphlet, but
would be charmed to do so. Anyone having a spare
copv will confer a favor by forwarding to “The
Sporting Editor,” Bulletin Office.
This week end will be one of inter-State
football in Eastern Australia. The Maoriland Rugby
League team will rage in Sydney on Saturday, at
the Agricultural Ground. The N.S.W. Rugby Union’s
team will fall on Queensland in the city of eternal
sunshine, and a band of invading Soccer men will
descend on Sydney on Monday and play a Soccer
crowd representative of the whole Ma State. Alto-
gether it will be a great time.
Fresh from the only victory of the season
over the premier team, the Newtown (N.S.W.) Rugby
League crowd was feeling pleased with itself when it
met Balmain on Saturday. So far Balmain had not won
its way to the first flight, and though there was
much talk of its marvellous improvement, Newtown
was not downhearted. In fact, it hardly took Bal-
main seriously—till the team from the Ragged
Suburb let loose a series of beautiful charges that,
although blocked, shook Newtown to the stomach.
But, all the same, during the first half Newtown
more than held its own, sweeping away the head of
every dangerous formation immediately it appeared,
and the first half closed with Newtown leading by 12
to five. After the change of ends Balmain settled
down to work. There was a horrible persistency,
and an increase of speed that worried Newtown
sorely ; and, spite of all, scores kept dropping in, till
the five became 20, and Newtown had failed to add
even a couple. And then the whistle went, and left
Newtown dog-walloped by a team rather far down
the list. The joy of the rout of Eastern Suburbs was
turned to dust and ashes. As for the premier team,
it comforted itself for its solitary downfall before
Newtown last week by falling on North Sydney, and
galloping over it. The figures were 34 points to 7
and the difference in the play seemed greater than
the margin in points. South Sydney accounted for
Annandale by 12 points to five; but it had a fear-
some tussle "to do it, and the youngest team of the
competition played a fine, determined game, strug-
gling like bulldogs. If it keeps on as it is going,
next season will find it in the forefront of the compe-
tition, in spite of its long run of reverses this year.
Glebe had a fairly easy victory over Western Sub-
urbs, by 27 points to five—the Western Suburbs
crowd being apparently short of wind.
The result is to leave Eastern Suburbs and South
Sydney dead level at the head of the procession, with
10 competition points each. Glebe and Newtown are
the second line, with eight each ; Balmain has six,
North Sydney four, Annandale two, and Western
Suburbs none. The Maoriland team is due to make
appearance on June 24, and during the time
it is raging in the land the competition will, of
course, be suspended. There is very much speculation
as to the prowess of this Maoriland team. A dark
suspicion has been seen wandering about at night
to the effect that in Maoriland the League game has
receded considerably of late.
In the Union Rugby division Western Suburbs
came its second cropper on Saturday last, at the
boots of Universitiy, and as Glebe managed to down
North Sydney by 31 points to three, Western Suburbs
fell from its high estate at the head of the competi-
tion, and took a place beside Newtown in the second
line, with 10 points, to the 11 of University and
Glebe. University had nothing to crow about. It
just managed to scramble through in a dishevelled
state bv eight points to three —but it changed history.
Eastern Suburbs belted Manly by 14 points to eight,
and Balmain and South Sydney drew, much to the
astonishment of everyone, and the litter bewilderment
of South Sydney, with 11 points each. South Sydney
is a crushed and dispirited team these days; for the
effect of the great slump is still on it. Newtown
also struck a huge surprise on Saturday in the shape
of a drawn game with the despised St. George,
which scored point by point till the tally was eight
all. So Glebe and University share the front place
with 11 points; Western Suburbs and Newtown have
10 each ; Eastern Suburbs has seven; North Sydney
and St. George six each; Manly five; Balmain three;
and South Sydney one.
In the Australian Rules competition the match of
the day was that between Sydney and North Shore.
The hillmen from North Sydney had overthrown the
Svdne.v crowd with comparative ease, and reckoned
they could do it again. And certainly they made a
brave effort, and for three-quarters held their own
very well. Then they collapsed. Their strength
gave out; and the Sydney crowd rolled down on
them, and also rolled clean over them, till the scores
stood at 54 to 28. The plucky but inexperienced
Rail and Tramways team met the formidable
Y M.O.A. Eighteen, and felt as if an engine had
gone over it —167 points to 13. East Sydney
managed to down Newtown by 46 points to 38 ; but
it was a hollow victory. Not only was it sheer luck
which gave East Sydney the game, but the Newtown
team was playing no less than 10 juniors m a team
of 18 and the fact took all the sweetness of the nar-
row victory from the mouths of the winning team.
South Sydney met Paddington, and struck the
toughest proposition an Australian Rule team has
bumped in Sydney. The Paddington game had all
been mapped out beforehand, and the lads played
it according to plans and specifications, kicking per-
fectly in spite of a hostile wind. South Sydney was
absolutely mystified and spiflieated, and beaten by
106 points to 11. It was terrific. So Paddington
heads the list with 32 competition P ou, t s • Sydney
is runner up with 28, North Shore and Y.M.G.A.
have 24 each; East Sydney has 1.6; Newtown and
South Sydney six; and Rail nil.
Judging by the increased attendances at
the vanous matches, Soccer football is growing in
popularity in Sydney, and if the governing body could
follow the lead of the Australian Rules section and
get some grounds of its own, the game would go with
a boom. As it is, it depends absolutely upon a
small but growing band of enthusiasts to keep it
going—and, considering everything they have to con-
tend with, the enthusiasts do wonders. The Rawson
Cup on Saturday supplied a couple of surprises.
Granville, which so far could score nothing better
than drawn games, got Canterbury down on Saturday
and kicked five goals to two ; and Glebe, one of the
top-notch teams of the competition, which, till last
Saturday, had never been beaten, bumped Newtown
and was belted decisively by three goals to nil. So
Sydney now heads the competition with eight points,
and Glebe is second with seven. Balmain and Gran-
ville have six each, Newtown five, Canterbury four,
and the warship Drake three. The Association Cup
is now a certainty for either Balmain or West Syd-
ney, which are together with 13 points, the near
rivals, Garden Island and Northern Suburbs, being
away to the deuce with six only; while the rivals
that are not near are hull down on the horizon. The
leading teams have both unbeaten records for the
season, and great will be the excitement when they
meet.

When the Maoriland Rugby League team,
which is to descend upon Sydney this week, was first
picked, hope did not soar high in the League’s bosom.
It was considered almost unrepresentative, as it is
to consist mostlv of North Island players, and mostly
of Auckland players at that. The critics were not
backward in remarking that it would not make a
decent mouthful for a Kangaroo crowd. However,
on Saturday last, its stock soared up a bit. It had
enjoyed no practice together, but it met and over-
threw, by 38 points to 16, a team representing Auck-
land, which, just now, is about the toe-ball hub of
the Shaky Isles. The redoubtable Francis was in
command, and he will continue to hold office as Lord
High Admiral or Chief Cockalorum during the raid
on Australia.
* * * *
The other Rimby League teams are get-
ting very tired of “D ly” Messenger. During this sea-
son the mighty hooter has hoofed 46 goals and scored
four tries in 10 matches, thereby notching 104 points
out of a total of 223 scored by the club. At the
present time Eastern Suburbs League team plays to
feed Messenger with opportunities, of which he makes
the best possible use. And a large section of the
public grows weary of the single star player idea
carried out to the bitter end.
S.A. Football League has fallen under
that benevolent despotism which used to be thought
the ideal kind of government. “Jim” Anderson has
been succeeded as chairman by “Ted” Cleland, who
is likely to be a K.C. shortly, and disqualifications
go on his sole judgment. Some extracts from his
reply to a recent petition for remission of sentence:
“I have carefully reconsidered the whole matter.. . .
I had regard to the previous good records of the
players, but I cannot, however, regard the alleged
leniency of the umpire as a matter which I can fairly
take into consideration. The disqualifications differed
for the following reasons; Edwards at the outset
acted in self-defence, but became involved in what
was, for the time being, a* fight. Oliver was the
original aggressor, although probably he also acted
on the impulse of the moment. As the aggressor, I
imposed upon him a slightly more severe sentence
than on Edwards. Mahony acted neither in self-
defence nor on impulse, but, being some distance
away, in mv opinion deliberately, and without any
excuse whatever, ran forward and struck Edwards. I
therefore imposed upon him a somewhat more severe
sentence than that imposed upon Oliver. I greatly
regret that the circumstances compelled me to act
as I did, and further that I cannot conscientiously
remit any portion of the sentences.”
The N.S. W. Rugby League proved itself
somewhat injudicious recently over the Farnsworth
affair. The judiciary body of the League has been
shooting hard in a laudable endeavor to suppress
fisticuffs, rough play, language a-.id general disorder,
and has been doing splendidly. Practically the whole
of the trouble is now confined to the junior grades,
in which the players are, to a large extent, irre-
sponsible boys. The respect shown the referee by
the First Grade players to-day is tremendous, and
most of them address him as Mister when occasion
demands that they should approach him. All of
which is as it should be. But only last week the
committee came down crash on a club which had
played two ’bailers who were not qualified by resi-
dence to be picked, and also dropped like a tower on
the two players. They were retired to the barracker-
line for a period of 12 months, and the club was
stripped of the competition points it had scored with
the aid of the pair of unqualified youths—which hits
the club just exactly where it lives. While this was
being done the 1-arnsworth affair was coming along,
and when it burst quite a number of people were
dazed by the explosion. A few weeks ago William
Farnsworth suddenly packed his traps and journeyed
to Brisbane, to reappear about 10 days later as cap-
tain of the Brisbane League team raiding Ma’s capi-
tal. The team received two awful drubbings in Syd-
ney, and then departed without Farnsworth, who had
gone back to his club, Newtown. With it he played
against Eastern Suburbs, and helped much towards
the overthrow of the premier team. Then the air
was split with a hoarse roar of general indignation
demanding why Farnsworth and Newtown were not
dealt with. Of course, the explanation is simple
enough. The N.S.W. League had loaned Farnsworth
to the Northern body with a view to advancing the
interests of the game; and it certainly was to the
interest of both Leagues to have a strenuous struggle
between the two State teams. But, in spite of the
loan of Farnsworth, the Queenslanders had no hope
and gave a wretched exhibition, and the League has
fallen on both sides of the fence.
Owing to the sending of 18 Sydney
Rugby Union players to Brisbane the Sydney council
decided to suspend the First Grade fixtures for June
22 and 29. As, of course, the absence of the stars
would give younger lights a chance to shine the coun-
cil's determination roused intense hostility among
the players who, so far, had not had much chance.
The hoarse roar that hit the Council's ears turned its
heart to water, and it hastily called a meeting of
clubs for Friday (to-morrow) night to decide what
should be done." If the Union sticks to its original
intention there will be war, strikes and wholesale
secession, although secession doesn’t appeal to players
as it used to, owing to the fact that the League has
more good players than it can place every Saturday
afternoon. But there is little doubt that the Union
will bend to the storm, and allow the competitions to
continue —with disastrous results to the clubs which
are just now on top of the scheme of things.
Hoofball in Melbourne on Saturday was
a dreary circumstance. The chiefest game was be-
tween South and ’Wood, and a 24,000 crowd viewed
the episode with mixed feelings, due chiefly to the
League’s folly in appointing as central umpire a
man who had hitherto figured only as boundary
ditto. This writer hates to berate a citizen who
doubtless does his best and who could not hope to
please were he the angel Gabriel himself, but he
desires to state, in a cold, measured tone of voice,
that the man was as incompetent as it was easy
to be. Because of this the game developed into a
rough wandering scrimmage. Only once did the Mag-
pies give a flash of their beautiful systematic play,
and though the Red-and-Whites marked better and
excelled in passing, their lamentable goal-shooting
almost lost them the match. In the second quarter
the ’Woodmen were disheartened by losing their best
rover and having a forward injured. Then a rain-
storm swept the ground, and thereafter all was dis-
gust and wretchedness and misery. Scores, South:
four goals 16 behinds; ’Wood, four goals eight be-
hinds. ’Roy, on its own ground, hoped to emulate
St. Kilda’s feat by downing the great ’Dons, but
miscalculated somewhat. The “Same Old” ran
away in the last quarter, piling on 32 points to one,
and were winners by 56 to 25. The Students started
badly, but put up a great struggle against Carlton.
Still, the 19 points they lost in the first quarter
were still debited to them when the bell rang—sB to
Carlton's 77. Richmond also kept Geelong on the
move, and for a brief few minutes in the last quarter
led by a point or two, but the Seasiders, who have
lively hopes of semi-final honors, made the dying
moments of the game all their own, and won by 54
points to Richmond’s 40. Melbourne visited St.
Kilda to interview Essendon’s conquerors, and at once
took charge of proceedings, swept the Saints off
their feet, and deposited them where sinners are
supposed to dwell —in the mud ; with a tally of 55
points to 24. With the first half of the round of
home-and-home matches complete Essendon now
boasts seven victories, South, Carlton and Geelong
six each, Melbourne and ’ltoy five each ; while Col-
lingwood, with four, cannot afford to lose another
match. Saints, Richmond and ’Varsity are outed.
In the Ass. North had the soft snap of the day,
Melbourne City, and gathered it in with 89 points
to 23. Brighton, by piling on 19 points to one in
the last quarter, knocked P ran s calculations and
ambitions endways, and rose a step on the ladder
with a score of 39 points to 34. Scray performed
the obvious in walloping ’Town —102 to 23. Essen-
don narrowly escaped another licking, from the feet
of ’Cote, notching only 70 points to the Brickies
65 The funniest match of the day was at Bruns-
wick, where Port negligently trotted round and
casually acquired seven goals nine behinds —51 points ;
Brunswick almost monopolised the play, but its
hopeless incapacity to kick where it intended very
nearly brought the disaster it deserved. The man
at the board made its score five goals 23 behinds—
-53 points, which gave it the win, but was nothing
to brag about. ....
Though the grounds were soft on Saturday to
start with and falling showers didn’t make them any
harder, accidents were more numerous than ever.
'Wood lost its rover—now lying in bed, mce ms
club mate, with a broken shin bone —and nad an-
other man damaged. A Southerner had ni.
broken. 'Roy's chief forward was ruptured badly,
and its wing centre was also sent away in an
lance. Ton's rover was carried off the held uncon
scious. Carlton lost one man, with a fractured
shoulder, while another had the small bones ,ot ms
hand broken; and there were many minor injuries.
Some of these calamities were due solely to over
strenuous “play," but others must be put
charging, kicking in the ruck, and general, reckless
plunging around.

The contrast in the personality and
methods of the two imported billiardists, Higgle a
liarverson, gave some interest to tneir
Alcocks Parlor (Melb.), last week, but as an cxhi-
bition of their best work it was a failure. Higgle tor
a long time couldn’t get going, and liarverson, with
a start of 1000 in 9000, scored nearly twice as man}
poims as the better man. The more earnestly the
Englishman tried to make a game of it, the more
he dropped behind. At last he put in a masterly
break of 400 odd, which seemed to relieve his nnnd
of the awful fear that he had lost his punch. It
was the first week in Melbourne of both players, s ind
Ilarverson’s form promised well for future engage-
ments. This week and next 1 red Lindrum and Wil
liams have the floor at Alcock’s. #

The omission of Wolawa from the list of
Melbourne Cup entrants brought re :oicing to the
bookmaking camp last week, or thereabouts. bast
year, Wolowa demoralised the opposition so com
pletely at times that the speculative punter always
coupled this animal as the Melbourne Cup end of the
double; and its omission has burnt thousands of
pockets, and caused the said punters to realise th t
at all times Moses has the big end of the stick, But
it is demonstration thrown away.

The wandering band of Australian bowlers
in England is getting the lustre oi' early success
knocked right off it. It trampled the first eight
clubs right into the grass, but in its meetings with
the next seven—up to last week end it went down
every time, and lost all the symmetry of its features.
There is a whisper the local cognoscenti that
the entertaining is doing its deadly work, for, as
everybody knows, these bowlers—especially since the
voung strong men took to it —are perfect whales
for refreshments. So apparently the rovers will have
to take a tight pull on themselves.

Cricketer J. R. Ilobbs is making the most,
iournalistically, out of the recent tour of the English-
men in Australia. While the tour was in progress
he wrote a weekly letter for the London Evening
News, and immediately on his return to London he
published a shilling book on the subject. Now he is
hard at work writing “Tales of the Tour” for another
London evening paper, the Star. The funniest ex-
perience of the trip, he says, occurred in Toowoomba
Town Hall, where the Mayor and the assembled
company made a mess of “For They Are Jolly Good
Fellows,” and ultimately broke down._ Hobbs tells
stories of some “conceited Australians” he met, of
Melbourne barrackers, and the predominant Australian
passion for gambling. At one place, after 24 hours,
be was invited to visit a certain brewery, with a
broad hint that it would be made profitable to him
to recommend this particular brew. Hobbs says
this was “particularly amusing” to him, as he never
drinks beer.
The motor cycle record book is a very
scarred and scratched volume these times. The
latest worry is one Graves, who, if he continues as
he has been doing of late, will shortly need one of
the things he is named after. On a 7-h.o. Excelsior
motor-bike he has established from a flying start on
the Plaza del Rey track, California, 24 new world
records. Here they are for inclusion in the book: —

These -new figures represent an average speed of over
90 miles an hour. It now looks as if a speed of
100 miles an hour on a motor-cycle is within measur-
able distance.

A remarkable team record was recently
put up in Maori land, in the Southland Motor Asso-
ciation’s Petrol Consumption Test by riders of 31-
h.p. B.S.A. motor-cycles, which ran into first, third
and fourth places. The winner, J. Davies, put up
216 road miles per gallon, and, later, won the
championship on the same machine —a fully-equipped
B.S.A. Roadster. Friend Davies beat the previous
record by miles, did the fastest time, and demon-
strated that, on his machine, anyhow, the cost per
mile of running at high speed is no more than at
low speed. Which is amazing.*

BROUGHT GENUINE RELIEF
FROM CONSTIPATION.
“Some twelve years ago,” writes Mr. G.
Bevear, Ogilvie Street, Blayney, “I was a
sufferer from rupture, and as Nature needed
some assistance, being more or less consti-
pated, I found nothing so good for genuine
relief as Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and
I always keep them by me for use. As a
family remedy I can also recommend them.
At Blayney I am a resident for 43 years,
and well known. You can use this testi-
mony.”
Nature often requires a little assistance,
and if this assistance is given at the first
indication, much distress and suffering may
be averted. Mothers especially should guard
the health of their children, and inculcate
regular habits from infancy.
As a family remedy for costiveness, Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills have a wide repu-
tation. They are mild in their action, caus-
ing neither weakness or sickness, and do not
gripe.
To overcome constipation, take from one
to four pills regularly until the bowels move
daily, and are restored to healthy action.

Hemorrhoids
Piles, or hemorrhoids, are one of the most weakening of
troubles to which mankind is heir. The victim is careless
and neglectful of the disease at first because the pain is slight
and the bleeding may only occur occasionally.
Before you become a chronic sufferer, use a remedy which
removes the disease, that is, take a course of Andrew Mur-
phy’s Pile Pills, which are sold by all chemists and store-
keepers at 3s. per box, post free. People who have suffered
for years marvel at the instant relief experienced from their
use. They cure permanently.
If you cannot obtain Andrew Murphy’s Pile Pills locally,
order direct from the Sole Proprietors: ANDREW

BENEDICTINE
“T.L.”: Can endorse “Homer’s” remarks
(B. 6/6/’l2) anent the American’s hustle
compared with the Australian’s quickness.
As a swift workman, the Australian beats
the American out of sight, and the Bull per-
son comes a bad last. I write from experi-
ence. The anti-Australian feeling was de-
veloped in S’Africa long before the farm-
burners’ visit to that country, and Bull, not
Boer, was responsible for it. The simple
fact was that stodgy John Bull could not
successfully compete with the men from
Ivangarooland in the Transvaal labor
market, and so he disliked them. I’ll allow
that the men from Kansrarooland. especially
the Victorians, helped to intensify this dis-
like by their meanness. Numbers of them
lived like Kaffirs or Chows. The land boom
had lately happened, and the hanks and
building societies and bubbles and shindy-
cates and wild cats had lately burst, and it
appeared as if they were trying to restore
lost fortunes. Also, many of them had rela-
tives to maintain, back in the country which
the borrowers had temporarily wrecked.
S’Africans thus came to misconstrue Aus-
tralian hustle, combined with meanness, into
the belief that Australia was a pauper
country, and the hustlers poor, unfortunate
devils who were afraid to lose their jobs;
and it has been left at about that ever since.

sales have exceeded by many thousands the record of any other car during a like
period of its existence. That is because it offers a value greatly exceeding any-
thing heretofore attempted in the industry. A comparison of equipment, specifications
and construction details with those of any other car at near its price will verify this
statement.

Veteran Howard Vernon and his young wife were
billed for a show in Port Said on the day when the
Australian contingent of Olympic Gamesters touched
at that ungodly place on their outward trip.
Now that the mischief is accomplished, a number
of ex-residents of Bagdad have begged to state that
all the bowing and scraping and salaaming at the
“Kismet” dance wasn’t a bit like the real thing. It
must be a painful reflection for the enthusiastic mas-
queraders that they went through a preposterous per-
formance in a ridiculously incorrect manner.
“Philoyid”: Miss Caroli, of the Quinlan opera, is
Miss Julia Davis, a brilliant Sydney Jewess, who is
helping Lalla Miranda to hold up Australia’s end.
Miss Davis went to study in France and Italy three
years ago. After spending a while on the concert
platform, she slid into opera, and has already tasted
applause in Britain, the Continent and S’Afriea. She
is remarkably like Patti. Patti told the lady so
herself, and she ought to know.
When newchums come along presently with the
remark that they saw “Ben Ilur” in dear old Lon-
don just before they left, their supercilious compari-
sons can be taken with an ounce of salts. Two of
the principals in the Drury Lane revival of “Ben
Hur” are well known to Australian playgoers.
Arthur Wontner, described as “somewhat lacking in
the necessary physique,” has the name-part, and
Miss Ethel Warwick, who didn’t strike this country
as being either a forcible or an experienced actress,
is the seductive Iras.
.1. Bull’s dramatic censorship, which is the jest
of all Europe, lately received a loud scoff from a
comparatively obscure character by the name of
Cowen. Cowen wrote a play entitled, “Tricked,”
and submitted it to the censor for perusal. He had
the joy of having it prohibited. Later on the un-
abashed person pushed his work, unaltered, under
the nose of the censor, but this time the title was
changed to “Quits.” The jest was disgracefully
successful, for the censor licensed the drama on
which he had put his official kybosh a few weeks
previously. Now people are asking what his kybosh
is really worth.
Winifred James, who went to England and wrote
a book, lost her aged father a few weeks ago. Not
many of Winifred’s acquaintances in this city knew
that she had a parson for a pater until they read of
him as the Reverend Thomas James, of Torquay.
The venerable James —he was 82 when he died —
was the father, too, of “Fred Lindsay, the Stock-
whip King,” who cracks his Australian weapon at
the music halls in Fogland, and has been royally
commanded to do it in the private presence of
George Five. There seems to be a steady demand
for stockwhip cracking in the old countries, and the
brother of Winnie James earns lots of salary at the
business. The wonder is that no girl has been
brought up to it. The Queen of the Stockwhippers,
with golden hair a-hanging down her back, would be
a “bill-topper” of the first magnitude.
“Storky” : Martin Harvey is to follow in the foot-
prints of Oscar Asche and 11. B. Irving. Harvey was
a member of Irving’s Lyceum co. as far back as
1887-8, and it was really with the assistance of his
old chief that he wriggled off on his own account.
He and his wife (Nellie Desilva) and William Havi-
land and Amy Coleridge (Haviland’s wife) availed
themselves of the London vacation to form a small co.
and pursue the nimble bob into the provinces. Irving
lent them wardrobe, props., etc., for something like
half a dozen plays—“ The Corsican 8r05.,” “Lady of
Lyons,” “Ruy Bias,” “Othello,” “Don Pedro de
Bazan ” and “The Two Roses” —and they relied on
the stock scenery at the various theatres booked.
The combination, known as the Lyceum Vacation Co.,
with Harvey and Haviland 'topping the bill, opened at
Bristol, where the business panned out so well that
the season had to be extended. After playing several
other towns the co., still drawing good business, had
to quit and resume with Irving at the Lyceum.
These vacation tours lasted for five or six years.
Then Harvey launched a co. of his own, with his
savings, plus a backer, and is now a front-ranker of
the “legitmate melodrama” school in London.
“J.F.H.”: When London finds a new dramatist the
managers are like a flock of sheep after a bell-wether.
A young fellow named Macdonald Hastings is in that
position just now. His “New Sin,” originally pro-
duced at an experimental matinee, made a big and
instantaneous hit. It has been put on for a run at
the Criterion, and looks like turning out another
“Kismet.” Another piece of his, “Love and What
Then ?” has scored a success at the Playhouse, with
Cyril Maude and daughter Margery in the prin-
cipal parts. Those are all the plays that Has-
tings has written so far, but he has accepted
commissions from managers that will keep his brain
crackling for long ahead. Most dramatists, when
they score a success, have only to open a drawer and
make a selection from the rejected manuscript plays
of bygone years; but Hastings has nothing in the
drawer —he has only taken to the business during
the last few months.
“Morgana”: Has anyone heard of Captain Jack
Kelly now appearing in Scotland in a stockwhip
turn, and billed vastly as “a brother of the famous
Ned Kelly, the Great Australian Outlaw”? To me.
he has all the appearances of a champion bosh. His
charming wife seems to be able to do her bit in the
same line also. In the Glasgow Weekly News she
details the following thrilling episode which she
alleges occurred at the “famoOs Sydney Show' Ground
last year.” “I was appearing with my husband in
a riding and stockwhip turn before an immense
crowd, when the horse I was riding became un-
manageable and bolted straight for the fence, the
other side of which was a precipice over 50ft. deep.
I gave myself up for lost, when, just as the horse
was about to rise for the fatal leap, my husband
lassoed him round the neck with his stockwhip, and
checked the brute in time.”
“Cockaigne”: Beerbohm Tree’s Othello starts the’
Reminiscents. No great Othello, it seems, between •
Betterton and Edmund Kean. Betterton got his !
traditions from Davenant, and Davenant knew actors ’
who had been allegedly instructed by Shakspeare.
Although a hostile critic (they were desperate par-
tisans in those days) described Kean’s Othello as a
spiteful nigger wench in short petticoats, it was un-
mistakably grand. His rival, Kemble, said : “I
didn’t see Mr. Kean, but Othello.” After Kean
there must be a hark right on to Brooke for a great
Othello, He and his chum Forrest were mighty,
alternating Othello and lago. When Booth and *
Irving alternated them in London, both Olhellos
were said to be indifferent, and both lagos good. At
the end of this run Irving washed off the Othello
paint, exclaiming: “Quoth the Raven !” I■■
daresay Rignold’s Othello is next to Brooke’s in
Australia—Rignold or Asche, who is of the Salvini
type. Salvini’s in Italian was a great London sue-,
cess, desperately barbaric, Sullivan played Othello
in Australia without distinction, but his lago was *
splendid. Brooke greatly excelled in lago. Feehter’s .
lago was good, and his Othello bad, a great disap- >
pointment after his Hamlet. One or two ladies ,
have attempted lago in England and America. Wil- '
son Barrett’s Othello was better than might have .
been expected. McCullough gave a powerful im-
personation of the Moor.
“Orient”: Consul-General Hwang, after being twice ;
baulked, has at last severely lectured Melbourne.
First time the talk on China was announced, he ■
hauled off, because he did not know whether to run ;
up the dragon flag or the stripes. Twelve hundred
people rolled up to his lecture, but brother Ah Chows
didn’t roll up worth 1 Id. They accpse him of sitting
on a rail over Our Glorious Revolution. However,
he goes in now up to the elbows —of course. I
never listened to such a significant harangue. Baden
Powell’s is a mere fly on the wheel by comparison.
Hwang is the only Chinaman that ever I heard speak
with fire and passion. The others have all been icy,
steely cold. Educated in America, Hwang even has an
American accent —very like Wilbur Chapman, of the
mission crowd, only ever so much more animated,
quieksilvery and declamatory. , “Qhiria is on the
move, people!” he rang out, almost with a shriek.
The people had not time to reflect on the bites under-
lying his eloquential pouring forth. “Justice!” he
cried. “The Australian gates must be unlocked to
Chinese just the same as to Americans, Germans or
French.” Terrific applause, though I heard someone
at the back say “Death to Australia!” Personally I
am not yet convinced that the Chinaman is up to the
Jap, but am absolutely sure that no Jap could imi-
tate American spreadeagle oratory like Hwang.
Alfred Boothman, for many years leading man
with Alfred Dampier what time Walter Baker was
the scheming villain of the show, is lecturer at a
picture entertainment in Masterton, one of Maori-
land’s “dry” towns where the incurable inebriates
are sent by their relatives in the hope that they will
drink themselves to death as quickly as possible.
“Screen”: An excellent 1100 ft. film of Ambrose
Thomas’s opera of “Mignon” is being shown in Aus-
tralia. This work was acted on the last night of the
former Paris Opera Comique. There is a mock fire.
The audience unhappily mistook a real one for the
mock article, and 150 perished. The authorities re-
solved that a church should be built there, but it is
again a playhouse. The Melbourne Theatre Royal
was burnt, February, 1872, after a performance of
“The Streets of New York,” which ended with a fire
scene. The fire smouldered in old scenery for nearly
five hours. New r theatre opened next November.
(“H.0.”: A play which has been written round
Elizabeth of England by the French dramatist
Moreau has been produced in Paris, with Bernhardt
as Liza. The Once Divine Sal provides what is, seem-
ingly, a fine study of a lady who isn’t the Liz of his-
tory. What seems to strike the critics most is Sara’s
stage bosom, alleged to be equal, for stage purposes,
to anything of the kind produced by nature. The
audience sees a good deal of it, too, the corsage
being open to the waist in front. For this, at any
rate, there is historical justification, as Harlay de-
scribes the original lady as receiving the French Am-
bassador “bared in the chest to the girdle, thus dis-
playing a bosom no longer beauteous.”
“Lawyer Bill”: Have lived the last 10 years on
stations in the N. Territory, so went to the Sydney
“pictures,” expecting to be introduced again to
some old friends. But everything was quite new to
me. The corroborees are farcical. A lot of
station “boys,” painted as no buck was ever yet
adorned, meander round in a God-help-us fashion.
The old lubra playing the digeru-doo (the bush
piano) is the only natural thing in the mob. The
attack on the “settlers” is, however, the limit.
All the niggers in the Territory mustered together
could not be got to attack five or six armed white
men in daylight. They might take it on about
“piccaninny daylight,” but hardly then if they
thought the other fellow was awake. They make
me cross, these misrepresentations of a good coun-
try.
Pierre Berton, the French actor who turned stage
experience into wealth by writing “Zaza,” appears
to have made a bloomer with his new play,
“Mioche.” The heroine is a giddy actress, like
Ziiza, and she also falls in love with a gentleman
outside of the profesh. They meet on a mail
steamer, in fact, and he is a young English duke of
serious tendencies—a Wowser duke. She happens to
be dying of phthisis, so he gives up his cabin to the
sick charmer, and soothes her last moments by read-
ing the Bible to her. Being dead, the lady is com-
mitted to the deep in the fourth apt. The manage-
ment tried to cut this last, act, but the author ap-
plied for ‘an injunction against the curtailment bf
his play, and the interment at sea was duly per-
formed. The audience, however, d d the funeral
scene, and snorted at the rest of the entertainment.
Paris might accept a well-behaved' young English
dook as a dramatic hero, but only on the condition
that he mustn’t Wowse. Frenchmen never Wowse.
“Theorbo” : The Quinlans give only 14 operas, and
Melba gave only 12. What an Ocean of Music is
sacrificed! Here js a catalogue of the grand operas
produced by L.vster in Sydney and Melbourne in the
benighted generation before last: “Aida,” “L’Afri-
caine,” “Barber of Seville,” “Ballo in Maschera,”
“Bohemian Girl,” “Carmen,” “Cenerentola,” “Crown
Diamonds,” “Don Giovanni,” “Dob PaSquale,” “Din-
orah,” “Elisir d’Atnore,” “Ernani,” “Faust,”
“Freischufz,” “Guarfiny,” ‘‘Gustavus,” “Huguenots,”
“lone,” “La Juiye;” “Lily 'of Killarney,” “.Lucia,”
“Lucrezia Borgia,” “Lurline,” “Luisa Miller,” “Lo-
hengrin,” “Maritana,” “Martha,” “Matrimonio
Segreth,”, “Mose in EgittoA “Norma,” “Nosse di
Figaro',” “Oberon,” “Prophete,” “Puritani,” “Pi-
pele,” “Rigoletto,” “Rose of Castile,” “Robert le
Diable,” “Semiramide,” “Sonnambula,” “Satanella,”
“Sicilian Vespers,” "Traviata,” “Trovatore,” “Wil-
liam Tell.”
“Melb.”: Placards notifying the auctioning of the
Sir Henry Barkly Hotel, at Richmond, on the Yarra
Bank, remind me that Harwood, the comed > *j t
the pub for awhile and got plenty of excitement out
of it. A terrific flood came, swelling right P of
first floor windows. Says Harwood. |°o , to
water hadst thou, fair Ophelia, and shifted to
Boobier's Hotel, in Little Bourke-stieet, | Ruck,
of the old wooden Princess s. Although Li > T,,ii e t
a little farther down, with Romeo Lane and Juliet
Terrace, was unsavory, yet Boobier s was qu>h »
fashionable hotel, very similar to the first Menzie
Hotel, in Latrobe-street, built by Governor L
as his private mansion. Here the great btar .
through their courses at d 1 nner, such as • •
Brooke, Sisters Gougenheim (the Geoghegans;,
Catherine Hayes and Anna Bishop.
At Goulburn (N.S.W.) the fizzy Holman
the other day flouted all history by declaring
that until Australia was prepared to buna
a navy to match the navies around it, tne
people shouldn’t waste money oni a ■
iron ship. Also, no doubt, Switzerland
shouldn’t have a field army of 200,000 men
!nd a reserve of 300,000 until it can raise a
fighting strength of 1,000,000 men with a
reserve of 4,500,000 the sa . me ,f-f G w a
has. Likewise, Balmain shouldn t have
ferry until it can get one as big as the Noi tl
Shore, and little Willie shouldn t wear trou
sers because his fathers would be too big
for him, and N.S.W. should go without an
Attorney-General until it can get one to
match the British legal potentate.
“Vigilans” : The External Affairs Depart-
ment has opened a Northern Territory office
in Collins-street. Melbourne. A huge brass
plate notifies the passer-by that the 527,000
square miles are represented within, but the
office-well, it is a cellar, and is Presided
over by one man. It is a cold, drear),
miserable place, with scant information ami
literature years old. A man who was wan
dering about the pit told me he did not
think the country could be developed by
white labor, and he laughed at the I ederal
Government for appointing men to expert
positions who know little or nothing ot tropi-
cal conditions; and I didnt hear anybody
argue the points with him. It this is the
way the Government intends booming the
Territory, I am sorry for the Territory.
“Chasuble”: The fine Congregational
Church in Victoria Parade, Melbourne, is
just demolished. It was built in 18(0, and
its original pastor was the Rev. S. C. Kent,
from Sydney. He turned to the Church of
England, and long held the pastorate of St.
Silas’, South Melbourne. The thnpmes fell
off so much that presently the R.C.’s, bought
the building in the Parade, and used it for
the out-patients of the neighboring St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital; but they found that it didn 1;
suit. Not very far away was Chalmers
Church, of the Presbyterians. This, also,
was bought by the R.C.’s and pulled down,
and the very stones were built into a con-
vent hard by—pleasant revenge, because Dr.
Cairns, pastor of the church, was especially
bitter against the Catholics. His beautiful
pulpit cost £250. The nuns gave it to then-
good friend, Mrs. Bon, a Presbyterian, widow
of a Western squatter, and it now adorns a
church out among the sheep and the sunsets.

ONE OF MANY TESTIMONIALS.—
ķ
Yamala,
Frankston, 3rd January, 1911.
Messrs. Philips & Pike, Melbourne.
Dear Sirs ~~
I send you herewith my cheque for the
Aerogen Machine, which you supplied to
me, as per your account enclosed.
The light is perfect and the installation
the simplest possible and most conveni-
ent. We find that anyone can manage
it with ease and complete safety, and it
has brought a very definite joy to my
house here in the complete banishment of
the kerosene lamps. Our servants are
content, and the cost seems likely to be
much lessened.
With many thanks,
Very truly yours,
(Signed) JOHN MADDEN.
AEROGEN SAFETY GAS can be used for HEATING and COOKTNG with best results.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped. Name
and address must appear on MSS. No liability is
undertaken re contributions voluntarily submitted,
whether sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will
be returned unless stamps accompany.
Mallet: Observe tbat, while you don’t
say, “'lo liell with all agreements!” you “do con-
demn unions for signing industrial agreements
which provide for service in a future that may be
tull of cnanging conditions.” (Jordially disagree
with you. This country wants big industries built
up on sound lines, and big industries can t be built
up if the men who run tneni can't figure ahead as
to costs for more than 24 hours. It’s very pleasant,
no doubt, for the worker to be in a position to drop
m on tile boss at any moment, regardless of agree-
ments, and demand another bob a day; but the
boss s uncertainty about the future may cost the
worker more than he gains in the long run. And
it certainly costs the country a heap more.. . .
5.11.: Small boy joke, like most of its class, not
humorous—merely imbecile... .Don Q.: Once more,
we don't mind boiling down the sprawling MS. of
the new-chum contributor; but when the MS. goes
on sprawling year after year we get tired \ ery
Old Subscriber: it egret that a long course of reading
iias left you so dull. Have looked at the paragrapn
top and bottom, and regard it as the most inoffen-
sive item in the week s paper—milder even than
the condensed milk advt Joseph Parr: Certainly
lie believes it. When you become a little more ad-
vanced in your studies you will believe it also. It
is all a matter of education A. Chandler: The
first suggestion was invented by the writer and pub-
lished in The Bulletin some years ago. Are the
others also borrowed?. .. .A Savage: Impossible to
•say. Take it to one of the leading violinists....
K.G.: Yes; apply to the Registrar, Technical Col-
lege, Ultimo, Sydney... .Talia: Might do if severely
condensed. Trilie sugary in parts, but improves
greatly towards end. Cut the rather tiresome intro-
duction, hurry up the old storyteller, stop him say-
ing “Wa-al, ’ like Salem Scudder, and generally boil
down one-half. You might start your blue pencil
on the final “Thanky, yes, I don’t mind if 1 do.”
that moist tag is 01d... .M.A.R.: Perhaps it is
only .fair to state that we rather like the Ladies’
1 oiitieal Ass, and have tethered it to a pigeonhole
until we find a spare hour wherein to trim its joy-
ously long ears... .Lewis K.: No admittance here for
the old-established “comic” family. Try and pro-
cure shelter for it in a more benevolent paper—
one of the sort that has ivy trained over its right-
thinking porch, and runs a religious column, and
keeps an Aunt Kate permanently employed Con
, : Idea fairly good, but treatment raw General
Notice: “A Bush Tragedy,” “The Bunyip’s Toll”
and one or two more straggling foolscap poems of
the gumtree order have been marked with the fatal
blue A, and buried in the office tomb, free of charge
m the presence of the Office Undertaker. “It that
is written on both sides of the paper and gone in the
feet shall not prevail.” R.i.P. No flowers
Loyalist: You do not find the target often enough
and your hitting power is not great W.P.: Dear
old “Hellfire Jimmy”! What a splendid fellow he
was! He could drink faster, fight harder, and make
fiercer love than any other man in the regiment.
Men loved him, women adored him, children throttled
one another for the honor of sitting on his knee,
and animals crowded round to lick his hand or his
ear. And yet (poetically speaking) he could not
keep track of his feet! Well, well! It’s a queer
world !... .Arthur: Don’t be impatient. At 16 years
the time is not yet ripe. Poem is a fairly satisfac-
tory one of the under-age variety D. 8.: Can't
desert with y0u....L.K.: Some descriptive lines in
it, but the general effect is chaotic. Have put it
thoughtfully aside for the Day of Repairing, which
comes a day or so before the (office) Day of Jud°‘-
ment. . Arthur II.: No use to u 5.... Panhandle
1 ete. The bottle story is a steal, though you may
merely be an innocent receiver of the goods. .. .Bush-
whacker : You can demand your own, but not the
other fellow’s. .. .Wagga: What is the point?....
Harry J.: The story of the drunken bushman who
ate a raw sheep’s liver in mistake for blanc mange
raises a twinge of doubt in the office Northman:
Yes, we noticed that statement, re the Territory,
that “there is no precedent in history of the per-
manent settlement of people from northern latitudes
within the Tropics.” Well, Queensland is building
a precedent now. And the Dutch did something that
way in Africa; part of the Transvaal is in the
Tropics. Also, the British are trying it in Rhodesia
and the Spaniards have done well at the job for 400
years or so in America. If you mistake the Spaniard
for a warm weather man try Old Madrid in mid-
winter. By the way, a good part of the Territory
isn’t in the Tropics.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
Lance M.: An unclean and purposeless joke. Some
jokes are dirty, yet clever, but when a person sud-
denly calls out _ “Bonedust” in the middle of a great
wilderness it isn’t clever. Anybody can suddenly
call out “Bonedust” in the middle of a great wilder-
ness ... .C. Richards: Idea for picture received. And
almost the same day an old art contributor in your
State sent along almost exactly the picture you de-
scribe. The very name of “Iceberg” Irvine was
bound to suggest it A.C.C.: Atrocious art, thin
gag... ..Jorum: Your doctor looks scarcely human,
and_ the other man has the outward semblance of a
devil.... A.C.M.: That pass-the-hat gag has turned
up 1000 times in a dozen different forms. ... R.R.:
It isn’t a caricature—only a page of face and some
outlying suburbs of hair 8.C.M.: Just lament-
able. .. .A. Waters: It had our unfavorable considera-
tion. .. .W.H.: Why make the publican a fiend and
his customers a pair of horrors, or two shocks? Why
not make them ordinary human beings?... .C.P.S.:
Pictures with a kangaroo and a lion on them have a
tendency to become monotonous.
Another sliprail was let down the other
day to enable a youth to escape from learn-
ing to defend the white blood and save it
from extinction in Australia. A Broken Hill
miner refused to allow his son, liable to serve
as a cadet, to attend at a notified place for
medical inspection. The aid of the police
court was invoked, and the theorist was fined
£lOO. Then he appealed on the grounds that
medical inspection wasn’t military service ,
and that the prosecution had not proved that
he had refused to allow his son to attend
drill. The Full Court upheld the plea with
costs against Australia, which is matter for
enthusiastic congratulation in Tory and
Black Australia circles.
The waiter is a poor, flat-flooted scuffler
with a fearful appetite for tips. A natural-
ist would describe him as “one of the order
of wingless but ambitious birds that are
always trying to fly, but only succeed in
skimming lightly along the surface.” When
he goes at top speed, the black tails of his
dress suit stick out behind like the rudder
of an aeroplane; and there are almost in-
variably soup stains on his white breast.
Sometimes he unconsciously misleads and
enrages people by his remarkable resem-
blance to. a human guest; then he doesn’t
get the tip for which his soul hungers and
his pocket yawns. The waiter will some
day become extinct. Someone will invent a
perfect food-fetching device which will not
put its thumb in the soup, or fawn for tips,
or use stifling hair-oil. That day is not yet.
The electric waiter has recently been
patented by an Australian; but it seems to
be no more than a clever, order-recording
device which requires the collaboration of
the grease-spotted skimmer or tip-swallowing
scout before the food can be swung under
the expectant feeder’s right ear and dumped
before him. Consequently, the contrivance
cannot be described as perfect.

The Message of Sanatogen
No preparation of its kird has ever achieved such
a reputation as Sanatogen.
Many causes have contributed to this unpre-
cedented result.
Pre-eminent among them is the constant prescrip-
tion of Sanatoyen bv the medical profession which,
as a body, has awarded it the highest praise. More
than fifteen thousand doctors have written in the
most enthusiastic terms to describe the benefi s they
have obtained from the use of the preparation
which The Medical Press and Circular states "has
strengthened the physician’s hand a hundred-fold.”
Everyone knows now that it gives
To the Sick —Health
It does this by its power of revitalising the
nervous, vascular, muscular, and digestive systems,
which it rapidly restores from a condition of depression
to one of normal action.- By virtue of its composition
—pure milk casein in chemical combi cation with
organic phosphorus, an essential constituent of the
brain and nervous system—it feeds the brain and
ne ves, it improves the condi’ion of the blood, it helps
the stomach todigestother food, and it therebv develops
and strengthens the muscles. In this way it gives
To the Weak —Strength
and that delightful feeling of returning vitality which
tells the sufferer that he has conquered til disease
which had conquered him, and is once more on the
road to health, and the p' ssibility of taking up his
life again where he had laid it down.
Sanatogen, however, does even more than this.
It has its message for those whom disease has not
touched. Everyone is capable of increased vitality and
vigour. By feeding the vital centres Sanatogen gives
To the Healthy —Vigour
so that work becomes a pleasure, toil becomes enjoy-
ment, and the whole system takes on a feeling of
buoyancy, alertness and energy which is as delightful
as it is unusual.
Sanatogen’s merits have not only been eulogis'd
by the medical press, and by the medical profession*
but have also been endorsed by hundreds of the bes -
known men and women who have testified to the
cures it has wrought in their cases.
Sanatogen may be obtained from all chemists.

Andrew Wilson. Please mention this paper, and

The Inky Way.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: According to my count,
the oldest newspaper employee in Sydney is John
Hayes, who has been connected with the Evening
News and Town and Country for 54 years.
There is money in the “trade” paper if the lever
gets into the right hands. Little Sydney Fairplay,
which for four years has been holding up Bung’s end
of the argument, remarked to its shareholders the
other day that in six months, to the end of April,
there was a profit of £346 on the paid capital of
£2105, with £lOO extra for contingencies; and,
following that, a dividend of 10 per cent, for the
past year was laid on the counter.

There was no issue of the vigorous, not to say
furious, King Island (Tas.) Record between March
20 and May 25. On the latter day the editor told
why. He had announced his candidature for the
Central Ward of the municipality, when “a fiendish
plot was set afoot.” Whilst strolling along the
main street, he “was, without warning, and con-
trary to all law and order, most treacherously seized
by a constable and four other men, who, after a
desperate struggle succeeded in handcuffing him,
strapping his legs and carting him down to the
jetty,” and subsequently he was “safely lodged out
of the way in the New Norfolk lunatic asylum.”
When he was released the election was all over, and
somebody else was alderman. Still, he bears no
malice. He merely remarks that one of his op-
ponents is a “widow-robber” and another is a “dirty
little devil,” while a third person is no worse
than “infamously immoral and sexually insane,”
though, to be true, they all “blackened their shriv-
elled souls with the vilest perjuries.” As for the
Mayor, the editor glories in the fact that some
time ago he had the joy of pulling the potentate’s
nose. Journalism on King Island is not a dead busi-
ness.
A branch of the London Institute of Journalists
has been formed in Sydney “for social purposes.”
This makes the third separate press gang operating
in the city, the other two being the Australian Jour-
nalists’ Association and the Writers and Artists’
Union. Of course, members of the two last-named
are mere literary bushwhackers, as Mr. Ileney, the
editor of the S. M. Herald, very properly hinted
when he said at the inaugural meeting of the tony
English infant that “at present there was no organi-
sation in Sydney available to all journalists for the
welcoming of distinguished visitors, press or other-
wise, or for the speeding of parting friends.” This
deplorable weakness on the part of ordinary Austra-
lian writers, and such-like blokes, will be remedied
just as soon as a charter arrives f ™ m T ® i; sts ’<]i s .
wherever the London Institute ot J° ur
penses certificates to “colonial” branches.

Some London papers of our time
fancv and others in extreme old age. The ®
Chronicle, which had Charles Dickens and Victorian
Chief Justice Higinbotham on its reporting staff,
lived to the age of 98, and then breathed its last.
W. T. Stead’s daily, preceded by much trum-
pet-blowing, remained with us only a month. ine
Tribune kept on going for a couple of years at a loss
of a quarter of a million to its wealthy Liberal M.P.
proprietors. The Morning Star, of which John
Bright was part-proprietor, had a career of 13 years
and a couple of eminent editors —John Money anc
Justin McCarthy. The freshly-pegged-out Evening
Times buzzed for a very brief spell, and closed amuu
a lamented disappearance of £BO,OOO. Some Tory
M’s.P. owned it. #
Jerusalem and journalism seem incongruous. Many
pious Christians will probably be surprised to hear
that newspapers are now really printed and pub-
lished in the Holy City. But the editors of Jerry
have their difficulties to contend with. Here is the
lament of one of them : “Owing to the disturbed and
unsettled state of the country and to the great
scarcity of experienced compositors, in consequence
of the steady emigration from Palestine, we have
lately been unable to publish the Truth regularly.
We know some papers that are never able to publish
the truth at all, although the country is quiet, and
there are plenty of experienced compositors avail-
able. However, the editor of the Jerusalem Truth is
making arrangements that will enable the paper to
“appear more punctually in future.”
According to Cecil Harmsworth, who chair-
manned the proof-readers’ annual dinner in London,
Andrew Lang, of all the authors of the day, writes
the most illegible fist, while Conan Doyle turns out
the neatest and most beautiful copy.
New York Life has caused grief and pain to the
Inky Way burglar. Like The Bulletin, Life copy-
rights its pictures and letterpress, and like The
Bulletin frequently has its original productions
stolen. Not long ago, New York Mail and Express
reprinted some illustrations from a foreign publica-
tion which had burgled them from Life. The last-
named arose in desperation and hauled the receiver,
who is always as bad as the thief, into the courts.
There it was held that when a newspaper reprints
anything from another publication, with or without
credit, it is incumbent on that newspaper to know
that the matter is not copyrighted unless the said
newspaper wishes to have damages bounced out of
it under the American Copyright Act. This was the
long-hoped for reply to the argument that the onus
of ascertaining whether matter was copyright lay
with thief No. 1. The Mail and Express fought the
matter right up to the highest possible horsehair,
but there was no escape. The Judge said, in effect,
that he would be unable to sleep with a clear con-
science until the publishers of Life had been handed
$1043. As there was nothing else to do the account
was duly met.
The proposition to bring Joe Ward from
Maoriland as a “Liberal” leader for Aus-
tralia is a silly-season joke. Maybe there
are syndicates that would be glad to have
Baronet lou for directorates and that sort
of thing ; for he browses affably among the
platitudes that shareholders feed on, and is
a useful advertiser. As a politician, how-
ever, he was approaching disaster for a good
many years before he struck it, and there
is no second time on earth for him.
LEISURELY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What Mr. Deakin shows is that the party is going,
its own way, and leisurely and thoroughly, about the
work of drawing up the policy. —Sydney Telegraph.
Now let us sing a song that’s new,
And let us sing it measurely,
About the patriots who do
Their work so very leisurely.
They hold it as a precious gift—
Yea, they regard it* treasurely—
Never to waste in mad unthrift
Their minds, but use them leisurely.
It gives them happiness supreme,
And it affects them pleasurely,
To loaf and hesitate jand dream
And do their duties leisurely.
And only the elector’s toe,
When exercised quite pressurely,
Can make these chronic idlers go
About their work less leisurely.

IN
BANANA LAND
Governor Macgregor opened the Port Alma
railway line amid gush tremendous. Port
Alma is Rockhampton’s latest struggle to
pretend to be a port. The Central Queens-
land town is one of Australia’s many marine
blunders —like Townsville, Maryborough,
Brisbane, Melbourne, Launceston, Perth and
ever so many more. The early settler, or
magnificent pioneer, or primitive ass (he
answers to one name as well as to another)
had one incurable fault. He had no faith
in the future of the country. He always
believed in following a river up till he reached
fresh drinking water, and till he was able to
ford the stream without getting drowned
above the waist. Then he remarked that
vessel of 100 tons would be able to get up
this far, and that there would never be any
bigger vessels in all the country’s history,
and he said in the memorable words of
Johnny Fawkner (or was it Batman?):
'“This is the place to build a village.” He
never saw beyond a village. Even when he,
by chance, struck Sydney it wasn’t the har-
bor, but the wretched Tank Stream that
attracted him. Rockhampton struggled
long and expensively with its river, and the
end was worse than the beginning, for
vessels grew in size faster than the stream
could be dredged. Then a sort of outport
was made at Broadmount, away down
towards Keppel Bay, but it decayed
almost as soon as it was born be-
cause the water was too shallow.
Port Alma is a sort of final effort, but
there is reason to suspect that the water at
Port Alma is also too shallow. The trouble
is this: If a port is made near enough to
Rockhampton to be a suburb or adjunct of
that town —so near that Rockhampton can
still hold the trade —the water isn’t deep
enough for fhe vessels that patrol the coast
nowadays. And if the port is made at deep
water it will be so far from Rockhampton
that the place will set up for itself, and the
pleasant, picturesque town away up the river
will be eclipsed. The strictly logical idea
would be to shift the metropolis of Central
Queensland to Gladstone. If Central Queens-
land put its whole soul into making a sea-
port somewhere about Gladstone, it might
grow a city twice the size of Brisbane, for
Brisbane is also a muddy misfortune or
miscalculation, planted too far up a shallow
river, and it has its Port Alma or Broad-
mount at Pinkenba. But Rockhampton hesi-
tates to make the plunge, and throw away
its 2d. in the hand for the almost certain £1
that is in the bush. So Central Queensland
hasn’t any port in active service that is
worth mentioning.
A Northern editor unbottled a great, sad
truth the other day. Ills periodical appeal
to subscribers, etc., to part up promptly,
this time concluded as follows: “A country
newspaper business cannot be rum without
money.” Alas, it can’t be even beer.
The foolish struggle for the Savings Bank
business begins to grow ridiculous. Already
Bananaland is hustling for offices for its off-
spring. At Rockhampton it is housed in the
Lands Office pro tern. At Mt. Morgan it
wants to steal a bit of land (and the best
corner at that) from the school-youngsters’
playground. In Brisbane, a block at the
corner of George and Elizabeth streets has
been bought for £6OOO for a head office. In
the outer parts of Bananaland, the school
teacher is threatened with the extra job of
savings bank officer. Extra pay is not threat-
ened. Soon there will be more banks than
pubs—banks, too, where even a deposit of a
bob will be thankfully received. So far, the
public hasn’t quite dropped to the cause of
this tremendous anxiety of the State to pro-
mote thrift. When it discovers that the State
wants the money in order to sink it in “per-
manent and reproductive” works that Cohen
has evidently grown a bit anxious about, the
public will probably decide to put it in the
tote.
BROWN : “ You" 1 re drunk, Jones.”
JONES: “ Y're liar, Brown. If I wash sober, y' wouldn' be game shay T wash drunk.”
The curse that Queensland’s cheap-nigger
party fastened on the North is still coming
home to roost. Mackay found its fourth
leper the other day, and all four have been
Kanakas. Almost simultaneously, it hung
a Cingalee for the murder of Mrs. Ching,
Mrs. Ching being a white woman who reared
a piebald brood in a Chinaman’s den in the
sugar country.
Douglas Rannie (one-time Government
Agent in the South Seas), in “Adventures
Among South Sea Cannibals,” paints a lively
picture of an old English “Resident,” George
de Datour, of Aore (1885). Rannie was
dining one day with Latour, when the latter’s
son suddenly announced : “Father, a dog has
Come in at the gate.” Latour, without a
word, picked up a rifle and shot the dog (a
native’s cur) dead. Over each gate-post
Latour had mounted a human skull, and
human thigh bones (crossed) were nailed
underneath. On a tree adjacent hung this
printed information: —
NOTICE.
Dogs and niggers are forbidden to enter inside the
Portals of this Gate. Any Dogs or Niggers found
therein will suffer the Penalty of Death.
George de Latour, British Resident.
Not long after, Latour and his son were
both murdered by natives of Aore. Neither
dogs nor niggers will stand too much of a
good thing.
Brisbane’s Speedy Home Building Society
(B 6/6/’l2) had a short life and hot a merry
one. It wanted Quensland to send in its
shillings ostensibly to buy homes, a lottery
being held to decide who should get the
pooled shillings and the homes. It wasn’t
necessary for the winner to buy a home,
wherefore the society might just as well have
called itself the Quick Beer Association or
the Rapid Jimjams Club. What this paper
had most to complain about, though, was that
the society proposed to give the winner only
half the shillings; the other half it kept to
pay for wear and tear of brains and hide.
The Registrar of Building Societies also
reckoned that this part of the scheme was
over the odds and hinted things to the pro-
moters ; whereupon the latter consulted
Stumm, K.C. Stumm’s opinion was so de-
cisive that The Bulletin now receives the
society’s assurance that the beautiful scheme
has been dropped.
“Frank Kyra”: An Archbishop has been
spending a week in Bundaberg, and while
he was there the drought broke ; whereupon
a local newspaper announced that the poten-
tate had prayed for rain, and “it is gratify-
ing to note that his prayers have been an-
swered.” It was at this same Bundaberg
that Dan Barry claimed to have had the
same luck. That time, too, an Archbishop
had prayed for rain, but it hadn’t come.
Then all the churches had prayed, yet
drought still afflicted the land. Dan
Barry arrived with his show. There
was. a rotten house the first night, and
Daniel, in the usual speech, deplored
the famine, and promised to try his hand
if Bundaberg would roll up better next
night. It rolled; and a grateful Dan, at the
end of the show, said he would now retire
and wrestle. Whether Dan wrestled,
nobody knows, but, anyhow, rain started
to pour down next day, and it went on pour-
ing with such energy that Dan reckoned it
safer to clear before he was either drowned
or shot.
One hopeful sign of the times at the Bris-
bane Anglican Synod was the fight put up
for Australian autonomy in Church matters.
Another sign, of ominous portent, was the
repeated use of sporting parlance by the
clergy, the. Chancellor himself speaking of
“side-stepping” an opponent’s argument,
while another very exalted functionary re-
marked., “I’ll bet long odds —at least, I
would if the Archbishop were not present.”
The assembled parsons also battled fiercely
for the principle of a minimum wage, de-
nounced sweating and even hinted that
strikes had their uses. We shall soon have
the Anglican clergy applying for affiliation
with the A.W.U.
Frigidity.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a selfish frigidity about our worshippers
which is hindering the increase of our congregations.
—Archbishop of Brisbane.
We are almost quite devoid
(Brethren, do not be annoyed)
Of the poor Dissenter’s cant and weak
acidity;
But, in pacing up the aisle
Of our proud cathedral pile,
You’ll be charmed to note our polish and
frigidity.
Little do we make pretence
To a super-eminence
Over other sects that battle with
acridity ;
But in one thing we surpass
Ev’ry creed of ev’ry class —-
In the length and breadth and depth of our
frigidity.
It’s “Good morning” to the Few,
But the common churchy crew
We never seek to know them with
avidity ;
For the watchword of the clan
Of the tony Anglican
Is a high-falutin’ bearing of
frigidity.
Other churches make a boast
Of their converts, and the host
Of the worshippers who vouch for their
solidity.
But their brag begins to fail
When you ask them: “In your pale
Have you anything approaching our
frigidity.”
No ! We never warm at all;
If a brother trip and fall
Not a single eye among us shows
humidity;
For our progress from the womb
To the cold and callous tomb
Is a study fine of orthodox
frigidity.
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, June 15, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah, —
The masked ball was a huge success from
a monetary point of view, though the tact
that naif the dancers wore masks and the
others didn’t gave it a haif-and-halt Ex-
pression when viewed from the gallery, ller
Ex., with Private Secretary Blyth, arrived
early, and from the stage watched the
gliders. Said stage was chastely arrayed in
palms. Mrs. Premier Denham and her two
daughters, Mayoress Raymond, Mrs. Did-
dams and other members of the committee
worked like fairy godmothers for a host of
Cinderellas and their best boys. The Bris-
bane Concert Band added a glad _ note to
the festivities, and what was lacking else-
where was to be found in, an adjacent tent.
Walter Thurlow, as Pygmalion, scooped
the men’s costume prize ; and pretty Nancy
Miller, as a Cow Goddess, left all competi-
tors at the turn for home. Two red dom-
inos danced together all night, and disap-
peared when unmasking began. The smaller
one showed just the tip of a very pretty
chin. Rumor, who is an unreliable lady of
the cat persuasion, walked late on the tiles
that night, and told the other felines that
the masked lady was a dame of recent mar-
riage, whose husband is away. And
next day all the cats gathered over an
afternoon milk, with a dead mouse floating
therein, and discoursed at great length.
The big hall was very bare on the follow-
ing evening, when it was given over to the
children for their ball. Only about 60 of
them were on the floor, although twice that
number huddled under the gallery. . Eady
Macgregor was an early comer and a late
stayer, and Mrs. Pagan, MrS. Holmes a’
Court and Mrs. Diddams fed and cheered the
youthful crew. Little Miss Miller, whose
father is the West’s Pictures Miller, won
the girl’s prize. Mayoress Raymond’s little
son, a self-conscious Beefeater, collected the
trophy in the other division.
On Monday night the Hello girls, and
others who come under Federal rule, held k
jolly little dance in the Cafe Majestic. Mrs.
Dick was there, beaming on “her girls.”
Last night the Arcadians held theii’
second hop this season, in St. Mary’s
Hall, Kangaroo Point. Allan and Stark’s
Swimming Club pranced on Wednesday.
This city will be; horridly exclusive dur-
ing August. The Governor-General has
taken, for a fortnight, Merthyr, New
Farm, where Chief Justice Griffith resided
some years ago. About the same time,. too,
the Chermsides will descend upon us in all
their glory.
Colonel and Mrs. Hopkins entertained d
large party at their home on Wednesday,
Ahout 100 heroes and die-hards sported the>r
impressive millinery in the throng, hnd the
regimental band coaxed alluring waltzes apd
two steps out of martial and other instru-
ments.
One of the flickergraphs here has
“Camille,” as played by the divine Sarah,
on its list. llow old is Sarah? Someone
said 08, and if that is true, she should be
envied by every woman over 30 on this
elderly globe. Her figure would do credit
to a weaner.
An engagement is announced which is
not causing any great surprise in this ham-
let. The star roles are allotted to Philip
Frankel, and Miss Stella Cohen, of Bondi,
The gentleman once trotted for Parliament
—it wasn’t exactly a run—and got a place.
That is to say, there were two candidates
for one seat and he came second. His first
wife was a sister of the lady to whom he is
now engaged.
Died, yesterday, pretty Mrs. Hugh Sim-
mons, wife of the minor Canon of the Angli-
can Cathedral. She was widely popular in
Church and charitable circles. Heart
disease was the cause of death. It is a
strange circumstance that the best heart
often gives way earliest, and the hardest
one lasts longest.
The Lt.-Gov. of Papua has been sojourn-:
mg awhile with, the Holmes a’ Courts. He
leaves for his piebald dominion on Monday.
. Percy Brier and Lucy Baker, both musi-
cians of note, gave a pleasant little concert
m Paling’s rooms on Wednesday. Late
comers found standing room only, and the
fact, that they were satisfied is a proof of the
merits of the performance.
“Passers-By” has ousted “Evervwoman”
from Mis Majesty’s. It is said not to be a
morality play, which will make it doubly
welcome.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

The Wine of the Barley.
FOR countless generations Ale has been a favorite beverage.
It was drunk in Egypt 3000 years before the Christian
era; it was known and appreciated by the ancient Gauls;
it was the favorite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and
is still the premier drink of the most alert and active peoples of
the world. It was the drink of the lusty and strong, the “doers”
in the history of the past.
Cascade Ale is akin to the ale of old England, for it is rich
in the qualities that promote health and strength. That its merits
are appreciated by those most competent to judge is proved by
the rapidly-growing sales in every part of the Commonwealth.
Sold at all first-class hotels and stores.

IF YOUR DAM IS
DRY, BUY A SCOOP.
Now is the time to buy a Scoop to clean out all the mud and silt—
Now is the time to make that Dam bigger—make it hold more water
when the rain does arrive.
A McPherson Scoop cuts its way quickly and cleanly in virgin or
ploughed soil, and is extremely light on the horse. Body is pressed cold
from one solid piece of steel —hot pressed trays are weak at corners. A
McPherson Scoop has Steel Runners and Detachable Handles.
I Want a Barrow !
“A good Barrow, something quite out of the ordinary; one that stands
plenty of knocking about.” To anyone requiring such, we offer
A Tubular Steel Barrow
whose specialty is “standing rough usage”—easily lasting out three or four
wooden barrows. Trays are pressed from a solid plate of toughest steel,
without’ seam or rivet —thus they have much greater strength than riveted
trays of equal thickness. Note how the tubular
handles pass round in front and protect the
wheel when dumping. The Barrow

“In Australia there is no grass and the
sheep eat rock-salt.” —Extract from an Eng-
lish school-book.
Premier Mackenzie, of Maoriland, on his
late chief:—
Joseph Ward’s Dreadnought offer had made
Europe pause.
But the pause of Europe on that occasion
was nothing to the paws of Israel.
When N.S.W. Attorney-General Holman
had to be saved the other night from a crowd
of alleged unemployed, he must have re-
marked inwardly that it was sharper than a
serpent’s tank to have a toothless child.
Haying busted the loan market in the
struggle to keep, say, 50,000 people employed,
the 50,0015 t person, immediately the loans
run short, calls him a “cow” or words to that
effect, and wants to hit him with a sandbag.
Incidentally, one of the crowd which at-
tacked Holman is, the writer believes, an
acquaintance of The Bulletin’s. He called
in at the office a few days ago, and an-
nounced his intention of murdering Minister
Griffith.
At latest advices, Abdul and Pietro are
still fighting hard, and one or other of them
is lying hard. Ten days ago came through
news of the usual victory—this time at Zan-
zur—when
Fourteen battalions, with artillery and cavalry,
quitted Tangier, and seized the Zanzur Oasis, after
bayonet tin" the Turks out of the hills to the south-
ward. After a sharp fight on the western edge of the
oasis, the Turks were expelled and pursued, after an
engagement lasting five hours.
On June 10, Rome reported that —-
The Turkish trenches, after the fighting, were
filled with corpses. In all, about 1000 Turks were
killed. One Italian officer and 29 men were killed,
and eight officers and 252 men were wounded.
Then Abdul, who is not quite so clpse to the
world’s telegraph offices, sent along his ver-
sion—or, at least, the Central News corres-
pondent with him did. He said that Abdul:
Attacked Castle Lebda, on the coast, 00 miles
south-east of Tripoli, on Wednesday, and drove off
the Italians, who left 1500 dead. The Turks lost 50
killed and 150 wounded.
Truly it is a mixed business.

Thcßoyal Commission
in their final report on Tuberculosis,
recently issued, clearly showed that
the chief danger to child life resulted
from the use of infected cow’s milk.
To quote one extract : “The Evi-
dence we have accumulated goes to
demonstrate that a considerable
amount of the tuberculosis of child-
hood is to be ascribed to infection
transmitted to children in meals
consisting largely of the milk of
the cow.”
When the mother’s milk is not
available, the “Allenburys” Foods
form the best substitute, as they are
practically identical with healthy human milk
in composition, nutritive value and digestibility,
and are absolutely free from all harmful germs.

“AboUt seven years ago, I got eczema and
havfe had it nearly every winter* off and on*
since then. My head and ears, nose, lips and
chin were one mass of sores, and I was
(SC
ashamed to let anyone see me.
My head, ears and face broke

touched them the water rati

the flesh off myself with
scratching.
“I read of the Cuticura treat-
ment in the paper, and I
thought I would try the Cutir
cura Soap and Ointment. I
sent for some and after I had
washed myself two or three
times and applied the Cuticura Ointment,
they eased the itching. I continued with the
Cuticura Soap and Ointment for about three
months, which I found cleared my skin wori :
derfully. I had suffered seven years and had
tried ever so many things all to no advantage;
until I tried the Cuticura Soap and Ointment;
and wa? entirely cured: I'hey made my skin
soft and beautiful; everything being cleaned
away. My skin is now quite clear, and there
has Weil no indication of the sores coming
ba’cfe;. 1 shall be glad for any sufferer from
fesdh trouble to hear of this, for Cuticura Soap
and Ointment certainly cured me.” (Signed)

Some glaring conspiracies of trainer and
jockey the owner or jockey v. “the stable” (not
to mention the common everyday efforts of owners
to hoodwink the handicapper and victimise the
outside public) are observed on the toteless turf of
late. Everybody seems to be disgusted except the
stiffeners and the racing stewards, who make no
sign. Recently it happened at a Melbourne suburban
course that a horse carrying £5OO of stable money
receded violently in the betting before the start, and
finished nowhere. In which instance the jockey, pre-
sumably, was running his own swindle. But as a
rule the system of robbery adopted is less obvious
to the uninitiated. A small stable investment,
obtrusively made, brings the stiffened gee ta a price
that offers easy hedging-—through discreet Ikey
mediums —to the original investors, and the get-out
is accomplished without creating any suspicion to
speak of. The well-backed stiff ’un passes as having
been beaten on its merits, and ranks as “overrated” or
“unreliable” until it brings off a big coup for ite
wily managers. From this particular kind of turf
evil the public would be almost wholly protected by
the tote. The machine takes a deceitful investment
from an owner, but it does no “hedging” for him.
And owners are not addicted to throwing away con-
siderable lumps of money in the hope of stalling the
public off their good thing when at last it is on the
job.

Harry Motton, the N.S.W. rifleman who
gathered in last Sydney “King’s,” journeyed away to
Townsville to make a raid on the Queensland
“King’s.” And he saw it through, too, although the
weather conditions were all against an old ’un. He
scored 228 points against Walker’s 224 and Arm-
strong’s 223, and started for home in triumph.

The United States and Canada have gone
dizzy over the selection of their teams for the great
Olympic road-raee round Lake Malar, Sweden. This
190-mile spin has roused such enthusiasm throughout
North America that the American Olympic Commit-
tee has chartered a steamer to take the teams and
their supporters across the damp, dreary Atlantic.
During the currency of the sports the whole crowd
will be independent of hotel accommodation, and live
on board the ship, which has been chartered for 46
days. The games start on June 29, and conclude, on
July 1, and in this road-race about the only great
cycling country that is not properly represented is
Australia. The trouble is, of course, that most of
our best road-racers are, in the eyes of the Olympic
Council, professionals; and the Australian amateur
bodies did not seem to be very keen on getting to the
spot, judging by the lack of effort to raise the neces-
sary funds. The N.S.W. governing body was the only
one that made any attempt at all; all the rest just
let the matter slide. There was plenty of coin avail-
able for the purpose if the various governing bodies
had taken the trouble to rake it in. They didn’t,
and Australia, as far as that road-race is concerned,
is up the spout.
The cable announces that Carl Morris,
sometime pugilistic White Hope from Oklahoma
(U.S.A.), has gone back to work. This horrible
happening appears to have been directly brought
about by the walloping sustained at the hands of a
gentleman named Stewart, of Brooklyn, in a 10-round
scrap at New York. Morris was not badly knocked
about; but he was convinced that as a White Hope
he hadn’t a possible. He felt he had made a mis-
take in leaving the engine cab. The clicking of the
rails called him, as it does every railway man at
some time or another. And the voice of the road
happening to blow along when Morris was suffering
from acute pugilistic disappointment, he heaved the
gloves into outer darkness and went back to his
locomotive, after a chequered ring career which
lasted about a pair of years.
HONK!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hot way for the Motor! Way for met
I am the Dominant Car! Behold!
They start and tremble, Scatter and flee —-
The timid and weak, the braiie and the bold,
When 1 make my hdrSh, imperious sign:
“Honk! honk! honk!” And, the road is mine!
They love me nbt in the Crowded town.
In the roaring streets Where I force my Wav,
Where the clanging cars go up and down,
And the clattering hoof and wheel all day;
I thread the mazes, I twist and call,
With my “Honk! honk! honk!” and I leave them all.
They love me not in the leafy lane,
They love me not on the King’s Highway;
They clear my path and their wrath is vain,
They love me not, but they all obey 1
And what care I though they stare aghast,
When “Honk! honk! honk!” I go flashing past?
Who rides with me shall have scant desire
For smooth, mild paces and lounging ease,
When swift —as swift as a running fire,
We dash by hedges and whirling trees,
And white-faced cottages all a-row,
Crying, “Honk! honk! honk!” as we onward go.
Now singing my vibrant sbng I flee,
Down long roads humming, by quiet Ways—
Faster and faster, till road and tree
Are swimming past in a stleaming haze ;
A cloudy whirlwind of dust and sound,
And my “Honk! honk! honk!” rings ail atound !
Mine is the joy of speed; I fly,
The white road leaps to my humming wheels
All blurred and rushing, it flashes by—
A grey web whirling, that spins and reels
Away in the smoking dust behind,
And my “Honk! honk I honk!” rings down tlie Wind.
I leap—l rock—like an unchained blast;
I storm along where the high-road leads,
And I toss the miles behind as fast
As a praying nun might drop her beads ;
With a rushing scream the wind goes by,
And exulting “Honk! honk! honk!” I cry.
They shrink, they stare, as I flashing pass,
Smoothly—sudden and swift as Death—
A glint of metal, a gleam of glass,
A rush, a roar, and a smoking breath—
Grey, settling dust on my reeking trail—
And “Honk! honk! honk!” like a distant waill
’Tis a god that guides me. Erect and still.
He goads me, flying, to greater speed ;
He checks, he curbs me as fits his will,
As the rider checks his frothing steed.
I pant, I quiver, I chafe and throb,
And my “Honk! honk!” dies in a husky sob.
Fain would 1 dare and the gods defy,
As the captive breaks his galling chain;
Mad with the rapture of speed to fly,
Impetuous, headlong, a hurricane—
Sweeping resistless, while over all,
Rings “Honk ! honk ! honk ! ” like a demon-call!
Ho! wdy for the Motor! way for me!
I am the Dominant Car t Behold I
They Start and tremble, Scatter and fleS)
The man and the beast, the young and the old,
When I make my harsh, imperious Sign :
“Ilonk ! honk ! honk 1” Ho t the road is mine !

Solid Breech, hammer-
less. The only pump
gun made bottom ejecting.
The big advantage of this
important feature is appar-
ent to every sportsman.
There is no opening at top,
sides, or rear —ONLY AT
BOTTOM of solid breech.
No dirt, rain or other for-
eign substance can reach
the working parts. The
solid breech also protects
the shooter’s eyes and face
from all possibility of in-
jury that might result
from defective shells,
etc.
Without question, the
safest and most depend-
able pump gun ever used
in the field.

Don’t Throw Your
Safety Razor Blades
Away.
The reason most men will not continue the use of
Safety Razors is only on account of the blades being
blunt. While an ordinary razor requires stropping
before every shave, a safety razor blade only needs
sharpening ever}' third shave, having a much finer
edge. It is really unnecessary to buy new blades
when the old ones become blunt. We' guarantee to
sharpen every Made sent to us, to your "entire satis-
faction—to give you an easy, smooth, delightful
shave. To prove our statement, send us one, two, or
three blades, plus 2d. postage, and we will return
them sharpened, free.
Please note that our charge for sharpening your
blades, and guaranteeing them, is 1/6 per dozen, and
2d. for postage.
P-S.—lf you do not own a Safety Razor, secure
one of ours ; it is the most reliable and cheapest on
the market. Post free, 4/9 each complete.

Young Artiste . . .
PRAISES
DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY.
I wish to tell yon how much benefit I have received from the use of Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery. In my work my throat often becomes irritated from
strain and theatre dust, and often it would be impossible for me to go through
my part if it were not for the benefit I get from a dose or two of Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery. Also, on two occasions I have been so unfortunate as to con-
tract a heavy cold, and on each of these occasions Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
helped me at once, and soon rid me entirely of the trouble.
I think there is nothing like it, and always have a bottle at home, for dur-
ing the coming winter I look to it as my safeguard against the throat chills con-
tracted so easily when leaving the heated dressing-room, and going into the
chilly night air.
I assure you I will always recommend it to all my friends.
Yours sincerely, (Signed) ELWYN HARVEY.
SAFEGUARDS from WINTER’S ILLS.

WHEN THE WOWSERS RULE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[WONDER what the world will be like
when the Wowsers run the show.
And there’s only gingerbeer to drink, and
nowhere jolly to go?
When everybody is home by eight —the time
that the curfew tolls —
And family prayers, by Act of State, are
forced upon ribald souls?
What a terrible Day of Gloom will be the
Sunday we used to know !
When Wowsers shriek of the Coming Doom,
and the Sulphur Worm Below!
And, under toe naw, to chapel or church
with our family and our wife
‘ We’ve got to go —or at once be sent to a big,
brown gaol for life!
And —Heaven forbid ! when all the pubs and
the restaurants of old,
Wherein we spent long, joyous nights, and
lavished our good, reel gold,
Are shut for ever, and changed by Law to
Bethels and mission-halts,
Where the plate goes round m a dizzy way
and a stodgy Preacher bawls !
And how will it be when the theatres stand,
deserted, and locked and barred,
And even the harmless German Band is ban-
ished from our regard?
And the picture shows (which “demoralise,”
according to Wowser views).
Are turned into “camps of exercise” for the
use of the Knee Drill crews?
And all the tobacconists’ shops are shut, and
smoking is made a crime;
And the man who trafficks in “cake,” or
“cut,” if caught, will be “doing time.”
And racing is made the Great Offence —its
punishment Death, of cc.urse —
With a trifle of Boiling Oil for those who
wager about a Horse !
And bathing—especially in the surf —will be
discouraged by Law;
And everybody, who possibly can, must grow T
hair over liis jaw !
And all the women will be compelled to garb
them in fearsome togs,
Decreed by Law and designed, of course, by
Wowser-President Bloggs!
And all the statues that fill (he park, and all
the pictures so nude,
That caused such anguish and pained remark
in the Early Wowser brood,
Will all be broken, or burnt, or draped, or
painted over again
By Wowser Artists, inspired, of course, by
the choicest Wowser brain!
And all the papers will be suppressed tlia*
have any sense of fun,
And editors wlio’ve perhaps transgressed will
be blown from a great big cun.
And all satirical bards and scribes will be
dropped in the raging main ;
And w T oe to the wretch who jokes or jibes in
the day of the Wowser’s reign !

Wolgan Valley.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WOLGAN ! So far as I knew it at all,
I knew it only as some remote
place on the Sydney-side of the map
of Australia, which produced kero-
sene shale, with industrial troubles as a side-
line. Then a man or two, not over-much
given to bursts of enthusiasm, said it was in
a valley not to be surpassed by anything in
the Rockies of America for rugged grandeur.
Go to the Tourist Office in Sydney, you say—
they will know something of it there. But
they don’t —it is off their track. The Rail-
way Guide won’t help you either. There is
no State line to Wolgan. Away back in the
supplement you will find a mention of it
among the coach routes, with the informa-
tion wrong. Take train to Wallerawang
and thence coach to Wolgan, says the Guide ;
and that much is right and possible. But
there is a better way. Take train to the
new station at Newnes Junction, and if you
have the luck to strike the Junction on the
right day you will find a train of some sort
or other running, or at least doing its best
to run, on the Commonwealth Oil Corpora-
tion’s private line.
The name given to the Junction tells part
of the story of the Commonwealth Oil Cor-
poration, hereinafter called the C.O.C. For
years and years before the spouting oil-wells
of America were worked, Scotchmen dis-
tilled burning oils from kerosene shale. Over
40 years ago this shale was found in N. S.
Wales, and whenever anything is found a
Scotchman is bound to turn up before long
to see whether maybe there is money in it.
There was money in this—in moderation —
and the N.S.W. Shale and Oil Co. was
formed. This concern worked deposits at
Hartley Yale and Torbane. But it worked
them in only a modest way, and made no
millions. Then happened along a Scotch
chemist named Sutherland, and he had imag-
ination. Perceiving that there were vast
quantities of the shale of a quality twice and
thrice as good as the average worked in the
Scotch refineries, he secured the property of
the old company and large areas of virgin
shale land in the Wolgan Valley ; and then
he went to talk to English money about his
find. That was seven or eight years ago. In
some way he got into touch with Newnes,
who made a fortune out of Tit Bits, and
with other rich London newspaper people;
and an alluring prospectus snared about a
million of money. The promoters ‘ couldn’t
be bothered talking in less than millions.
And that was a bad thing. A campaign of
dreadful extravagance began. The engineers
picked upon Wolgan as the chief centre of
operations. But how to reach Wolgan was
the problem. There was no railway there,
and the country to be crossed to reach it
was the wildest in N. S. Wales. But had
not the company millionaires at its back?
So a survey of a line was started. As the
surveyors got to work they found that unless
they riddled mountain after mountain with
tunnels, and bridged gorge after gorge, they
could not build a line that any ordinary
engine could haul a load over. So a special
brand of engine had to be adopted as part of
the scheme —an engine that wouldn’t rebel
at a grade of one in 20 or 25. and had no
stupid prejudices against a 5-cliain curve.
There is such an engine, the Shay ; but the
weird apparatus has a rooted objection to
travelling more than 10 miles an hour,
though the last arrival is said to do a head-
long 12. Unfortunately this one wasn’t
waiting for us at Newnes Junction.
No doubt w T e were lucky that there was one
waiting at all. Last week a train had left
on Wednesday and Saturday. This week,
for the sake of variety, it left on Tuesday
and Thursday. But, whenever it leaves, it
leaves very gradually. Timed to pant out
of the station at 1.30, the Shay hauled out
its small train, consisting of a few huge oil
tanks and an elongated passeliger-box, at
. 2.30. Still it made most excellent time. It
lis 30 miles from the Junction to the head
'of the line, and we got there by 6.30. Com-
ing back, we were not so precipitate. We
left at 8 o’clock, and were landed at 1.25.
Anyone with a taste for mathematics can
figure out that we did an almost exact 5+
miles an hour.
All these things, and a few more, explain
why Wolgan Valley isn’t on the tourist
route.
For 20 miles you wonder why you came.
You try to persuade yourself—and you have
plenty of time to do it in—that this thicket
of mostly-stunted gum timber has some
compensating charms. You start from
Newnes Junction, the highest point on the
Western line. You have climbed already
the Blue Mountains, and left behind you the
wonderful glimnses of azure valley, purple
ravine and many-hued cliff. Then you leave
the characteristic beauty of these Blue Moun-
tains, climb still higher through sparsely-
timbered country to the Junction, and toil
higher yet into this scrub. Away, to the left
you can see traces of the once famous Zig-
Zag, on the AVesteru line, now cut out by
the engineer. In the right season, you tell
yourself, this scrub would be very beautiful,
for there are clumps of waratahs by the
thousand ; but their time of glory is not yet,
and you have to imagine their crown of
crimson. Now and again through a break
in the hills you catch a misty glimpse of dis-
tant blue ranges, with a flash of red cliffs in
the afternoon sun. But at the 19-mile post
you are still wondering whether it was quite
worth while. Then the guard, conductor
and factotum acquires a more confident tone.
Great domes of weathered sandstone, fling-
ing their points above the highest trees,
give warning of a change. Soon the domes
begin to take fantastic shapes. Yonder is a
Chinese pagoda. The layers of sandstone
have been sandwiched between layers of iron-
stone. The bed has been tilted up into a
peak. Countless frosts and a million winters
have eaten away the rock, the sandstone
faster than the ironstone —and see now your
pagoda! For the next 10 miles you wonder
why you did not come before. And instead
of cursing the gradual Shay, you thank your
stars that such grandeur is not flying past
you and a scurrying motor-car.
Away down in the depths of a ravine the
now-exulting conductor points to a white
scar on the brown face of the sandstone.
“We shall be down there presently,” he says.
You wonder how even the plodding, patient
Shay will do it. You begin to swing around
towers and crawl along the sides of for-
tresses. You look behind you, and there is
no visible way of retreat. You look ahead,
and there is no visible opening to your
prison walls. Twice, neither by worming
their way along precipices nor by climbing
could the engineers make progress, so they
bored a path through the encircling wall.
Coming back, before you enter the long tun-
nel, you may drop comfortably off the train
and walk through the gorge at its narrowest
part. You can stretch out your arms and
touch the walls on either side. No man has
measured the height of the cliffs and domes
that rise above you. Away down in the
valley, a surveyor’s shirt waves in front of
the C.O.C.’s refinery works. That isn’t much
of a cliff, but the surveyor who trimmed off a
sapling and tied his linen to it found that
it was 1800 ft. above the level of the creek
that swirls along a bouldery, gravelly bed at
the foot.
Out in the jungle of Java is the well-pre-
served Boro Boedoer temple, the mightiest
ruin of “the East,” the great cupola at the
apex surrounded by scores of smaller
cupolas, each at one time the shelter of a
carved Buddha. Now, in the distance of this
Wolgan Valley, you approach great fantastic
shapes that utterly dwarf Boro Boedoer, and
cupolas beside which the surmounting
cupola of the Buddhist monument is a mere
inverted spinning-top. Five hundred feet up
a sheer wall of cliff there is a ledge that
seems wide enough only for a goat track, yet
it serves as foothold for a grove of forest
gums. Then up beyond the fringe of green
rises the sheer wall again, it may be another
500 feet; and at the top perhaps a crest of
green.
You have definitely taken now the eastern
side of the canyon, and the train creeps
along an ever-winding track scratched on the
face of the broken range. For once and once
only the gorge opens out into a valley with
an arable flat at the bottom of it; then, as if
suddenly ashamed of her placid mood. Nature
threw, up a rugged peak, the Wolgan Moun-
tain, in the midst of the fertility. Then the
valley closes in again, and foot by foot you
get closer to the stream that tumbles along
its broken course at the bottom. Boulders
big enough to furnish the stone for a city
warehouse have crashed down and driven
the water hither and thither. Here above
you is a cliff-face pitted as though with
smallpox in the days of Pharaoh; there is
ene fluted. Here the molten ironstone has
taken weird shapes, and as the yellow sand-
stone has crumbled, the black intruder stands
out like Chinese lettering 50ft. long. A tree-
less ravine adds its trickle of water to the
Wolgan stream, and away up the recess the
eye follows a grove of tree-ferns, some of
them pushing their crowns 25ft. up towards
the light. It is an hour to sunset, but
already the valley is in deep shadow, and
the white straight, stems of the towering
gums by the creek-side stand out against the
deep purple of the far embrasures.
One twist more, unnoticed among hun-
dreds. and the straggling township of Wol-
gan begins. At its widest the valley here is
not 200 yards across ; often there is no level
ground at all. So the cottages either crowd
along the creek or perch on the hillsides
when they rise the least urgently. If they
perch, a “flying fox” brings them water from
the indispensable creek below. Thus for two
miles they straggle along—very poor places
mostly, bark huts very many of them. There
is one hotel, and when you know it you
know another of the reasons why Wolgan
isn’t on the tourist route.
Another twist or two, or maybe a dozen

Mrs. Stapleton, who recommends
Bile Beans to all sufferers.
1 WAS a great sufferer from rheumatics,”
* says Mrs. A. Stapleton, of 136 Forbes
Street, Sydney. “It caught me most
severely in the back, legs and hands,
and the pain was so dreadful that it was
impossible for me to get about. Sharp
twinges would shoot through the affected
parts with torturing effect. My back
and limbs swelled up enormously,
and 1 used to dread anyone to come
near me for fear they would touch me.
Even the slightest pressure, as from
the bed-clothes, would cause me great
agony.
“ 1 suffered thus for a long time with-
out getting ease from anything. Bile
Beans being recommended to me as a
proved cure for rheumatics, I started a
course, and presently I was conscious
of great relief. The twinges grew less
in their violence and frequency, the
inflammation and pain left the parts, and
the swelling went down. Altogether I
felt very much better, so 1 continued with
Bile Beans until I was quite recovered.
“ Bile Beans are a grand medicine, and 1 have also found them a
splendid remedy for biliousness. I suffered terribly from this complaint
and severe headaches, which used to prostrate me for days together and
render me unfit for anything. A course of Bile Beans completely cured me of these distressing
troubles, and now a dose of Bile Beans keeps me free from them. From my experience 1 can

—you lose count of contortions as you
worm your way among these mountains—
and the 0.0.C.’s works are ahead of you.
As usual, there is a mountain behind and a
cliff in front —the modest cliff with the sur-
veyor’s shirt fluttering 1800 ft. above the
stream level. That cliff forms part of a
molehill through which the C.O.C. designed
to drive a tunnel five miles long. _ Like most
things designed by the C.0.C., it is less than
half finished. And like many of the things,
it was probably designed wrongly. I don’t
know how much was spent on these works
and the means to reach them, but we can be
safe and put it at a million. To-day they
are either unfinished or idle. Not a wheel
is turning. In the township they tell you
at one twist of the creek that it is a strike;
at the next that it is a lock-out; at the inter-
vening boulder that it really doesn’t matter
which it is—the works are all wrong, and
would have had to be closed down, anyway.
For a fact, the affairs of the C.O.C. are in the
hands of receivers, and no man knows how
the deplorable business will end.
So more than half the cottages are empty,
and the wrecks of scores of others strew
the little patches of wild-growing cosmos;
and only a caretaker or odd mechanic wan-
ders over the works. Great brick retaining
walls that cost tens of thousands prop up
retorts and stills and filter presses and kero-
sene vats and naphtha tanks that cost a
hundred thousand. There are half-finished
products everywhere. What could be
rushed through and made marketable has
nearly all been shipped, but there is a blue
lake of 40,000 gallons of kerosene in the
huge tanks still waiting shipment. And in
the bottom of the shallow tanks are millions
of flies. The bush is thick with them; the
oil attracts them; and a touch of it does the
rest. Alongside, the foundations for a
500,000-gallon tank; electrically-driven re-
frigerating plant capable of making 80 or
90 tons of ice a day, and accommodation for
another of the same size ; provision every-
where for growths, and instead of growth,
atrophy, rust and rapid decay. And that,
and the boarded-over windows of the white-
washed cottage with the bark roof and the
neat garden, are as sad as the graveyards of
infants.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SAM had a head similar to a goat gazing
through a hole in a wool mat. His
whiskers stuck out like the bristles in
a yard broom. He was tall enough to bump
his top hair as he came through a door.
Sam did any job that found him out, and
caught him not ready to dodge. His leisure
Sam spent within earshot of popping corks
and the grind of the beer-pump. Sam’s view
of life was mostly gained through a glass,
as though he was practising to use a tele-
scope. Sam spent most of his time waiting
for someone to say “Have one!” It was
like making a proposal of marriage to a
maid of 35 —odds on the affirmative.
Sam had a dog named Zip. Zip stuck
to Sam almost as close as his whiskers. He
we 5 a sort of tool of trade, for he helped to
earn Sam many a pint. Zip had been edu-
cated to rush at strangers’ legs, showing his
white teeth, with the lip lifted like a dis-
gusted girl. Just when the stranger had re-
conciled himself to losing a mouthful of
limb Sam would step up, and lift Zip with
his boot right through the door or window.
He really only kicked the atmosphere, for
Zip leaped at the right moment, but even
kicking the atmosphere has a strengthening
effect on the leg. Sam was usually moist-
ened after that.
One night Sam and Zip were resting in
front of the refreshment house, when a man
with gauntlet cuffs and pants, and a long
coat that fitted as though he worse corsets,
and a handkerchief in his sleeve, minced
into the front bar. He carried a kit-
bag, an overcoat, and a pair of suedes.
Zip looked at Sam, and winked. Sam
swung his kicker like a fighter try-
ing his punch, or a bowler warming up.
He patted Zip on the spinal column, and
heaved a sigh of anticipation. Sam wiped
imaginary froth from his hirsute decorations,
as he followed the trail of the fashion-plate
into the lair of the pewter and the cork-
screw. At the appointed time Zip made his
rush, with his teeth open like a rabbit trap.
He made a dive at the turned-up pants, and
as usual Sam hoisted Zip out into the
street as though he was a toy balloon float-
ing in the breeze. Sam stood by waiting
for the profuse thinks and the polite invita-
tion. He stood on one foot and then on
the other and coughed, and made the usual
weather notes, but the stranger never once
referred to the fact that Sam had a hole
in his whiskers. It was the same as taking
a girl to a jeweller’s, and buying her a cake
of scented soap for a present. It was plain as
pimples are the sign of spring that the stran-
ger was not anxious to cultivate Sam’s ac-
quaintance. After licking his lips and doing
the patience act, Sam began to get irritable.
He had gone in by the early door, and the
show was late in starting. In desperation
he asked the stranger if he intended to do
it up. The man in the nice clothes an-
swered with telegraphic brevity, “Not
much!” and continued to say nice things
to the vestal virgin who mixed the drinks
that Sam was not enjoying. Sam felt
his leg twitch. He would have liked
to make the pretty boy follow Zip on an
excursion through space, but was not natur-
ally vindictive.
After a while the visitor walked out, with
Sam making rude remarks behind him. At
the door a sudden impulse seized Sam.
He couldn’t help it any more than he
could have sidestepped the measles. Sam
grabbed the stranger’s kit-bag, and, taking
two steps, swung his leg. It was a lovely
drop-kick. The bag soared gracefully into
the air, like a crow taking the wing. It
flew with the speed of a wireless message
through space. A blurred line marked the
kit-bag’s aerial course, and it disappeared
over the horizon as completely as a resolu-
tion to save money. The stranger’s eyes and
mouth expanded in astonishment. Had
this been an ordinary yarn he would have
wiped the floor with Sam. But this is the
exception that proves the rule. The visitor
only looked as surprised as though he had
just inherited a million.
When Sam realised what he had done he
felt sorry, and wanted to explain. But the
stranger would hear nothing. He took £2
from his pocket and told Sam he wanted
him to play with Carlton. Sam did not
understand, but took the gold ones on chance.
Later on the new arrival explained that he
had been sent to scour the back country
for players, and he persuaded the kicker to
sign on, though Sam didn’t know the rules
of football from the Lord’s Prayer. Still,
he meant to try it. The stranger, who in-
troduced himself as Joe, brought Sam and
Zip down to town. He took Sam to a horse-
clipper, and had his fleece removed. They
stuffed a new kapok mattress with the fur
that came off Sam. When his face was
smooth Sam looked just like anybody, ex-
cept that he was big as a man multiplied by
two. He was an out-size in humanity.
The rest of the week Joe spent in teaching
Sam the rudiments of the game.
On the day Carlton played Essendon, the
mountain of flesh appeared on the green
grass in a neck-to-knee costume. When
the game started Sam just bogged in. He
got off his balance, and fell on men no
matter what colors they wore, and they
were removed from the field for first aid,
crushed and breathless. Sometimes Sam got
the ball, and, putting his toe into it, the
bag of wind went flying over the fence, but
never in the right direction. Several times
the ball was punted into a neighboring sub-
urb, and the game was held up till they
sent for another. Small boys picked up
heaven-sent footballs next day. When the
players bumped into Sam they cannoned
off like rain from a greased board. The
match itself resembled more a hand-to-hand
battle than mere sport, and the scores were
even with a few minutes to go. By an ex-
traordinary sequence of accidents Sam got
the ball about half-way down. It seemed
an impossible shot. People thought it might
be done with a rifle bullet, but not with a
football. The public never expected Sam to
kick that goal. But readers of this record
of events do expect a development of this
sort, and they must be obliged. With all
his strength of limb Sam booted the ball.
The impact was so severe that the thing
blew out like a motor-tyre on a country
road. But the flabby leather bag had plenty
of driving power behind, and it flew on its
way right between the posts, and drifted
out of sight like a cloud of steam. The
yell that greeted Sam’s kick was louder than
the thunder of the surf with a sou’-wester.
It was as though someone had stuck a
match in a fireworks factory. Carlton won
the game by Sam’s goal. In consequence,
the opposing partisans took to the umpire.
This is the unwritten law of the game.
The umpire dashed for safety, with the
crowd a good second just behind his heels.
He sprinted for the door of the pavilion, but
found it locked. He turned like a mouse in
a corner. What chance did he have against
that mob? Not a hope. They began to
bump the umpire about. A fair creature
dashed from the crowd, with a white face,
and hung about his neck, shielding him
from the blows. It was the umpire’s best
girl. Just then Sam saw how things were
going, and shoved his way to the front.
With one steam-hammer kick, the door fell
into kindling wood. Sam shoved the baited
umpire through, and swung round to keep
the crowd of man-hunters back. One bar-
racker, with the mania on, came at Sam,
but he was changed into an airman in-
stantly with the aid of Sam’s boot. A
second also flew without wings, and a third
soared gracefully into the background. The
next man was in so great a hurry to get out
of the danger zone that Sam just skimmed
his coat-tail. That was the downfall of
Sam. There was so much driving power
behind the kick that did not connect that,
when it struck space, Sam lost his equili-
brium, and threw a back somersault inside
the door. He uncoiled himself, and got up,
limping, with his knee out. The crowd had
melted away. Sam saw the umpire and his
girl in holds, tasting each other’s lips. Zip
came up and licked his lfand.
Next day Sam and Zip started to walk
home. Sam was not craving for any more
football. It was too much like hard work.
He landed back at the pub. in time for the
race meeting. In three weeks he was again
surrounded by his whiskers, which grow
rapidly in a favorable atmosphere.

How much those accidents offend.
Your tongue, I hasten to admit,

And, what to you must seem absurd,
You cannot understand a word.
When I desire to have you know

“I think the weather fine to-day.”
Nay, worse; for aught that you can tell,
Instead of suchlike platitude
Of simple sense, I might as well
Be saying something very rude —
Or something that is far from true,
And maidens shouldn’t listen to.
How vainly people laud the style,
“That speaks the tongue of every land”;
My pencil would but raise a smile,
My brush she would not understand,
Though endless canvas I should spoil
With water, black and white, or oil.

Appears to mock my anguish, in
The boast of Esperanto’s scope,
In speech, to make the whole world kin.
O, Universal Language, weak,

Stay! I have stumbled on a thought
That fires anew my flagging nerve;
Where art and language come to nought,
The touch of nature still may serve—
Softly I kiss her little hand—
Ah, maiden, now you understand!

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR SPECIALISTS.
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True H*lr-Growlng Compound
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time—yet the hairs came
not. I had given. up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
, fl ™> yet soft, black growth Z W
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound I hold over one thousand letter! from pSe
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
Sfl y lt: is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others—but Ido assert
