Far Countries
Madeira: Old and New , by W. H.
Koebel (G. Bell and Sons) gives a well-
illustrated account of an island which is
Madeira
really a Land of Laissez Faire,
and might easily have been
the original of Tennyson’s lotus-land “in
which it seemed always afternoon.” The
climate is excellent, the scenery beauti-
ful ; there are flowers in profusion, and
the Madeira wine is still amongst , the
best in the world. The people are igno-
rant, it is true; but peaceful, polite *and
agreeable. Repose is an art which they
have cultivated to perfection. Time has
no value to them; everything is done
leisurely. A letter addressed to a place
distant a couple of miles #away may take
the Post Office a day or a week to deliver
—it is all a matter of chance. In the
water, however, the natives display
activity and skill which command pro-
found respect. The book is divided into
two parts—-the first consisting mainly of
a translation from a sixteenth century
history of the island which provides
some interesting anecdotes of ancient
inhabitants. Captain Cook called there
in 1 / 68, and battered the fort outside
the capital in return fer an insult to the
British flag, but came back afterwards
and lived quietly on the island for a while.
His house is now occupied by Dr. Grab-
ham, and the author states that next to
Grabham the name of Reid is amongst
the best known in Madeira. It would be
safe to bet that people named Grabham
or Reid would do their best to annex the
limelight on any part of the earth.
Florida has not the same appeal as
Madeira to the seeker of dreamful ease ;
but according to Florida Enchantments.
Florida
by A. W. and J. A. Dimock
(per Dy mock’s Jibrary), it holds
bigger bait for the sportsman. The
crocodile and manatee are the largest
game, dolphin and tarpon fishing afford
excitement, and there are plenty of other
things to kill. I his book is a record of
the fishing and hunting adventures of a
party on the Homosassa River,, en-
riched with a large number of photo-
graphs which are worth looking at. The
fauna of Southern Florida is passing
away, the wilderness is disappearing be-
fore advancing civilisation, and of the
Seminole Indians there is left only a
cowed and cringing remnant of less than
three hundred souls.
Around Afghanistan, by Major De
Lacoste, a French traveller of much ex-
perience in Asia, not only describes the
Afghanistan
places and people he met
on his journey round the
border of Afghanistan, but gives a dis-
interested view of the problems in which
that country is concerned as a pawn in
the game between Russia and Britain.
The translation of the Major’s narrative
is simple yet picturesque, and the book
(from Pitman and Sons) is extremely well
printed and illustrated.
Among the Wild Tribes of the Afghan
Frontier, by Dr. T. L. Pennell (Beil and
feons), throws more light on the character
and manners of the hardy folk of the
Indian Marches than Major De Lacoste’s
travel story, though it is not so attract-
ively written. The doctor was in charge
of a medical mission station in the north-
west for sixteen years, and writes with as
full and intimate knowledge as any
European could gain of the people who
have so often made things lively for the
British. Like the Hindus, the Afghan
Mohammedans are intensely religious j
the mullahs (preachers) are their real
rulers, and the ascetics—fakirs or sadhus
are proportionately as numerous and
repulsive as in India. Dr. Pennell was
fascinated by these strange followers
° Simple Life, who represent
the embodiment of the religious ideals
of the East, and in order to learn
something about them, became as one
of them, adopting their dress and habits,
and travelling about amongst them
for some time.' He learned that a
native was treated with scant cere-
mony by Anglo-Indian officials. Even
when he called on a missionary he had to
stand waiting for hours in the sun until
the sahib found leisure to see him,
whereas a European visitor would have
been invited to a seat inside. “ If we
English realised how much pain we often
cause our Indian brethren, not so much
by what we say or do as by the way we
say or do it ... a great cause of racial
misunderstanding and ill-feeling would
be removed.”
Bell and Sons send another illus-
trated work emanating from a medi-
Persia
cal mission —:Behind the Veil
in Persia and Turkish Arabia.
by Mrs. Hume-Griffith and her hug-
band. In addition to the usual guide
book information, there is a great
deal about the women of Persia, who
seem to have a particularly bad time, and
are reckoned of very little account. The
worm will turn at times, and when roused
there is hardly anything dreadful that
a Persian woman will not do. There
was once a famine in the land, and it
came to pass that a certain man of high
position had made a corner in corn, and
refused to sell at anything but famine
prices. Finally, he was arrested, tried
and condemned to death. The Shah
wished to make the punishment fit the
crime, and at'first, no doubt, thought of
“something with boiling oil in it,” but a
happy inspiration came to him—lie
handed the unfortunate man over to the
women of the Court. They kept the
James A. Patten of his time in their
quarters, and cut him to pieces with
scissors—a little every day—till he died.
Australian Fiction
In the far off days of our youth we read,
surreptitiously, the yellow-paper-covered
history of the great and varied adventures of
one Jack Harkaway. Jack did everything
well. In a cricket match at Oxford he made
a century, bowled most of the wickets, and
threw a man out from the long field. In all
manly exercises he was an adept, and, in
addition, he was the soul of honor, “ a
gentle and perfect knight.” Blest if he has
not been reincarnated in the person of Tom
Elliott, in The Thunder of the Hoofs , by
Dr. W. H. Lang ('per Dymock’s Library)—
and is doing some of the old things over
again ! Like Dr. Lang, Tom is a Scotchman,
and, after exhibiting his prowess as a
cricketer, he performs splendidly on horse-
back, with the gun, and the fishing rod. : He
is very keen on horses, and bets a good
deal ; eventually goes broke, and is cut off
without a shilling by an angry father. He
comes to Australia, and, strange to say,
his best girl and his worst enemy alsc
reach this benighted land, and locate them-
selves . near him. Assorted adventures
result in hero overcoming villain, and win-
ning best girl—as in the days of Auld Lang
Syne.
The Thunder of the Hoofs would not
have satisfied Dr. Lang’s versatile rela-
tive, Andrew, what time he wrote the
Ballade of Railway Novels,” for then he
said with emphasis :
Give me your villains deeply vile.
Give me Lecoq, Jottrat and Co.,
Great artists of the ruse and wile,
Miss Braddon and Gaboriau.
This story is all very obvious and ordinary,
and we liked the Doctor better in The
Romance of Australia.
Sweet Isabel of Narragoon (Greening and
Co.), by Lionel Laggard—presumably a
nom-de-plum, as the lady in the pic-
ture said the other week—begins with
the mystic word “Coo-ee!” In any pro-
perly constituted novel that word should
place the reader at once in the heart
of the Australian Bush. An outsider, Horn-
ung, once allowed a preposterous heroine to
“coo-ee” in Rotten Row, and the book
died young. Sweet Isabel observes the
proprieties “the shrill, far-reaching cry
came from one of two horsemen who,
after riding through a stretch of un-
dulating forest country in the Port Phillip
district of N.S.W., now the State of Victoria
in the young and proud Australian Com-
monwealth,” etc. These two blades take up
a run, one of them falls violently in love,
and strange complications ensue ; there are
bushrangers, blacks, bad whites, snakes,
bush-fires and race-meetings well mixed up,
and everything comes out right in the end-
including the villain, who is duly hanged.
Laggard is not too slow; he knows some-
thing about the country, and the story goes
with a bang as soon as he gets his characters
started, but he might have dispensed with
“the quaint and curious oaths ” of one of
them. We are told “ he had gathered some
of them from old plays, others were scrip-
tural or classical or of his own invention.”
Bob Acres could have told him liow 7 to make
a better lot.
A nod is as good as half a column to a
blind horse, so it is only necessary to say of
The Buchjumper 1 (per G. Robertson and Co.)
that it is Nat Gould’s latest. j
Sleeping Out
In certain climates, much is to be said for
the conventional bedroom, and under some
circumstances it may even be allowed that a
grate full of red coal is fair and desirable
company. In Australian houses, however,
one needs no more than a balcony or a
verandah, with stars and other friendly
things overhead and round about one, to
make sleep-time pass comfortably. Of course,
occasion is, even on this genial coast of ours,
when a south-east wind (like that, for in-
stance, which sometimes follows on the post-
equinoctial migration of sea-mullet) slants
the rain till there is no dodging it, and com-
pels one to take up his bed, and shoulder
his rug, and seek shelter. In normal years
these visitations are rare occurrences, and
for many nights in a month no violent rush
of rain disturbs the couch of the sleeper-out,
and he is visited only by the gentle dew
from Heaven.
Imported habits die hard, as is instanced
by the fact that the top-hat still uplifts
itself in silken insolence above the cli-
maiically-appropriate soft fedtr and straw
head gear of our city streets. To borrow a
term from Oliver Wendell Holmes, what the
Australian character needs is depolarisation,
and it is needed in more things than the
stuff and fashion of our clothing. Why is
Asia always the East with us—to ask an old
question over again ? And why do we con-
tinue all our days, and all our time, to talk of
England, Ireland and Scotland as “Home ” ?
When we recognise that the North is North
and that the East is East, and that this con-
tinent of wide horizons is something more to
us than the mere abiding-place of birds of
passage, we shall be less of a curious and
casual people wandering about a country,
and not knowing what to make of it.
Under the new order our residences, like
our clothes, will be adjusted to Australian
conditions, and the architects of the future
will fashion us residences with most of the
dormitory space outside instead of inside,
and we shall give the pure night air a chance
to feed our lungs, and redden our blood, and
lend the resilience of steel to our nerves.
I live on the heights of North Sydney,
just far enough away from the midnight
trams and trains to mute their rattle to a
not unpleasant murmur. Some trees still
stand in the vicinity—old, staid gum trees,
that seem eternally immersed in thought-
brooding, waiting, wondering. In the whole
country side there is no soil to which the
roses take more kindly than to that of the
gardens which lie within scent of the balcony
where I sleep. By day the air is pure, by
night it is purer still. No dust drifts down
to charge the atmosphere, if one except
the unseen, impalpable ever-falling dust of
ruined meteorites.
The sleeper-in devotes that interval, which
intervenes between going-to-bed and going-
to-sleep, to mental visioning, introspection,
reviewing the events of the day,. or taking
thought of the morrow. At times the night
is hot, thick with humidity, and sleep comes
tardily. He is surrounded by walls ; he is
dominated by a ceiling. He feels himself
oppressed by man-made conditions, and walls
and ceilings seem to divide him from some-
thing of which he is part and parcel—the
trees and the stars and the breathing earth.
As a recipe for inducing slumber the sleeper-
in sometimes counts sheep. The sleeper-out
in a similar necessity counts the stars.
Consider how restful and soothing it is to
lie down beneath the benediction of the
studded heavens instead of walls of brick
and mortar and a ceiling of lath and plaster,
to have trees and gardens and the universe
around, about and above one. What have
the planets, the stars, the constellations,
done to us that we should every night shut
our doors on them and put them away from
us '(
Every lover of fine achievement must, at
some time or other, have given a thought
to Napoleon’s splendid battalions as they
marched down the road of France. Every
night the sleeper-out is fronted by star-
legions sweeping westward—a universe on
tlie march, and that is surely a much finer
sight than is even a mental vision of the
great Emperor and his army. Sometimes,
when the winds are still, and Ihe trees are
still, and there is only the shrilling of a
cricket on the air, and the night is too
beautiful for sleep, he lies, face upwards,
and wonders whither the stars are marching,
and Who said “ Forward ! ” to them, and
Who shall cry “ Halt ! ”
I think some souls are so fashioned
that they move;, breathe, and have their
being more fully at night than by day. I
do not mean the spoiled night of the city,
but the stainless lady of open spaces.
I knew a singer (within recent years,
with a jest on his lips and a smile
in his eyes, he exchanged his lyre for a
harp, and his laurels for a halo) who every
night, for many months, opened his door
when other folks closed I heirs, and went out
to walk the dark ways till dawn. He told
me that he loved the darkness better
than the daylight, because the daylight
always imposed limitations—showed him
the end of a street, the height of
a hill, and the littleness of man. Night,
on the other hand, helped him to
escape from the tyranny of limitations.
Beneath its magic all roads became endless,
and hills grew so high that on the- crest of
some one or other of them a star seemed to
sit as on a throne. He left some suggestion
of night’s power over him in the following
lines : . .
I love the Night and every little breeze
She brings, to soothe the sleep of dreaming trees.
I love the Night! Bright Day the soul shuts in ;
Night sends it soaring to its starry kin.
It is a moment of mystery, of wonder,
when the sleeper-out awakes in the silent
hours and realises that the city is asleep.
All the windows within the radius of his
vision are lightless, no footfall sounds in his
ear—all is stillness, all is life in suspension.
Then, suddenly, it may be a meteor Hashes
through the sky, lives a crimson second, and
fades ; but, flashing and fading, teaches the
lone watcher of the night that there is no
such thing as cessation in Nature—that the
Universe is still on the march. Perhaps he
feels with Browning that
; God’s in His Heaven,
All’s right with the world.
I would like to say something about moon-
light as it appears to the sleeper-out, and
about the trees in the moonlight—how alien,
withdrawn and native to another world the
white magic makes them appear; and I
would like to say a word, also, about the
dawn, and to tell how the old earth tries to
rub the sleep out of her eyes at sight of it;
but a bird is singing, and it is morning.

800 pages of descriptive matter, of which
150 are devoted to Australasia. Judging
by the latter, it is a well-written and trust-

Bad Results of
Tram Accident.
The Case of Mrs. Mackie.
Nothing but good can result in giving to the
public some hint as to the various incidents in
which Mrs. Kate Mackie, of No. 2 Stanley-street,
WoolloomwWoo, once played a prominent part.
In beginning her story, Mrs. Mackie said :
“ The ups and downs of life experienced by me
since arriving from Kilkenny, fifty years ago,
would make interesting reading, and I must say
that, taken altogether, I have a great deal to be
thankful for.”
“Yon have had your share of bad luck, as well
as good luck, like most people,” suggested the
pressman, who had called on a mission of enquiry.
“ Indeed, 1 have, and I consider the worst mis-
fortune that befel me was in connection with an
accident that happened two years ago, when I
was unfortunately the central figure. I intended
visiting Lavender Bay, and when I got as far as
Circular Quay in the tram, I was in the act of
alighting, when the car started off, and I was
thrown on to my face and hands on to the road.
A notable bump, such as 1 got, does not agree
with a woman well up in years, and my system
suffered severely from the terrible shock I received.
I was thrown out of gear altogether, and it looked
for some time as though the consequences were
going to be very serious, for I might have died.
My nerves were fairly broken up. To give you an
idea of the fright I received, I may tell you that I
have not been in a tram since. I have a positive
dread of them. I believe if I boarded one of them
now I would take a fit, mv aversion is so strong.”
“ Perhaps you are still'suffering from nervous-
ness ? ”
“Oh, don’t you believe it; for I was not long
in getting something that attended to my troubles
m respect to nerves, and I chanced to read of it—
Clements Tonic—in the papers. The advertise-
ment I read appeared before me one day, like a
beacon acting as a guide to a mariner in distress.
Lhe case fitted in with my own in some respects,
and something whispered to me that Clements
Tonic was wliat I required to put my system to-
gether again. And, believe me, sir, I was fear-
fully weak and ill, not a vestige of strength
remaining in my body. It must have been dread-
ful for other people to see me shaking like I did,
and I could not have written with a pen for any-
thing. But how wretched I was at night, not a
wink of sleep ever coming to my relief, while the
thoughts that ran through my brain were some-
thing horrible. The same round of things went
on from day to day—no appetite for breakfast,
dinner, or tea ; a head that felt like bursting with
aches from daylight till dark, and then on through
the night; when I stood up, a giddy feeling that
made things appear to be turning around in tin
room ; terrible pains in the chest, and no life or
energy to help me withstand it—no wonder I felt
that I would rather be dead than alive.”
“Yes ; there is not much to live for when one’s
trials are so great.”
“And another thing I suffered from for years
was palpitation of the heart, and had tried nearly
every known medicine in the hope of getting
relief, but no—not till I bought some Clement-
Tonic, and then I certainly did get something foi
my money. And, oh ! what a joyful surprise it
was when I at length realised that my nervous
affections were commencing to subside, for the
possibility that threatened of being a confirmed
invalid for life became more remote as each bottle
of Clements Tonic was finished. The constant
twitching of the nerves at last gave way to a
steadiness that had hitherto been unknown to me,
and in every respect (in regard to my digestion,
especially) I was reaping benefit each clay. 1
thanked God for my good fortune in coming into
contact with Clements Tonic, as it was undoubt-
edly the one remedy that saved me. My illness
had pulled me down a lot, but through sleeping
so and eating so well, under the influence
of my latest medicine, I picked up wonderfully,
and was soon as right as could be.”
“This can be published, Mrs. Mackie?”
“ Yes ; in any form your mind suggests.”

The story
told by parents who have
cured their children with
SCOTT’S Emulsion is al-
ways one of intense
satisfaction. Mrs. Hale,
23 College Street, Bal-
main, N.S.W. writes (Au-
gust 1908) : “My little
daughter Lilian was deli-
cate from birth, and was
such a poor, sickly little
child that I really thought
we should not be able to
rear her. She made very
little progress for the first
twelve months, but we
then tried
scorrs
Emulsion
which built her up and did
her good where every-
thing else had failed.’*
Recoveries like this are the best
proof that there is something in
SCOTT’S which makes it different
from (and far superior to) any-
thing else, and every other emul-
sion, for wasting children. This
“something” is the power to cure,
and it is derived from the
high strength and perfect
purity of the ingredients
and their perfect and
palatable combination
by the unique SCOTT
process. Of all chemists

The Way of It.
What a race we had run, Young Ambition and I !
How tired were we from the glare and the heat !
How hard were the stones that had blistered our
feet !
And all of it ended so soon with a sigh !
Came Love, with the tenderest quizzical smile,
With cynical mouth and a cute little wink,
Said he, “’Tis more comforting here, don’t you
think? ,
Just lay down your burden, dear lady, awhile !”
He moved my dea,r burden, what time the sun
setting
Had gathered my dreams in a halo of gold
Ambition trailed off into gloom that is cold,
And I fell asleep, all my troubles forgetting.
I woke—and I shivered-! the dusk was so deep !
The gold had all vanished, the sky was dull grey ;
“Oh, what have you done with my dear burden,
say?”
But Love for reply merely snored in his sleep.

Morning.
Bright the rising sun
And the waking maiden,
With her life begun
And her heart joy laden ;
Hope and dream combine
Like the sunrise shine.
Like the sunrise shine
Over field and meadow
(Or a wand divine
Parting grief and shadow),
Hope and dream combine
In a rapture fine.
Maiden sweet and fair
In love’s garden lying,
Roses in her hair
Where the dew is drying,
Hears the happy thrush
Sing with scarce a blush ;
Hears the blackbird cry,
Of his mate departed
Smiles to hear him sigh,
He’s so broken-hearted,
For the world is wide,
Birds on ev’ry side.
Noon.
Shines the afternoon.
And the glowing bowers
Raised to shelter June
Dreaming on her flowers ;
Shines the woman’s face
With a softer grace.
Birds among the trees
Laugh and flutter mating ;
While the southern breeze
Bends to blossoms waiting,
Wakes them with a kiss
From a dream of bliss.
Roses pink and white,
Roses redly burning,
Flash upon her sight
Set her bosom yearning
(To her throbbing breast
Roses red are pressed.)
Soon her lips are crushed
By a royal lover,
She who never blushed
Glowed and thrilled all over,
She who never sighed
Hid her eyes and cried.
Night.
Sweet, the gentle night,
Savior of the weary.
Closing glare and light
From the eyelids dreary.
Night, upon thy breast,
Lull thy child to rest!
Shut the morn away,
Hush the moon’s shrill crying,
She hath done with day,
She hath tired of flying,
Bid Life’s tumult cease,
All she begs is peace.
Not a hope remains
In her weary bosom,
Not a red blush stains
One leaf of the blossom
Love’s warm lips caressed
Clinging to Night’s breast.
Shut the morn away,
Hush the noon’s shrill crying,
She hath done with day.
She hath tired of flying ;
Shut away the light,
Leave her here with Night.

The Castle.
Many years I heard a clatter
Of a castle building, building,
And it slowly rose in beauty
With its carving rare and gilding !
And for years it went on waxing
In its grandeur and its splendor,
And they scribed its marble pillars
All with legends old and tender.
And I said, “ When it is finished
I will rest ine in my leisure,
It shall be a proud asylum
For my contemplative pleasure.”
And I joyed to hear the clamor
Of the workmen strong and steady,
And I said, “My lordly castle
Will in little time be ready ;
It shall be my Age’s solace.
It shall be my Labor’s crown
Lo ! There came a crash of thunder—
’Twas my castle falling down !

From a Village comprising model streets, model homes, model
schoolrooms, and a model factory; from a Village, in fact, from
Which all that can suggest dust, drudgery, and Weariness has been
altogether banished—from such a Village is it surprising that there
should come the purest, most Wholesome, and most palatable cocoa
that the World has eVer tasted ? In short, is it surprising that
“'BournVille *’ Cocoa —the ideal product of ideal labour conditions —
should prove itself to be at once the most nourishing
and the most popular of all home beverages ?

TT ISN’T WORTH WHILE; A WORD TO
ALFRED DEAKIN.
Alfred Deakin—that honest, brilliant, erratic,
intensely patriotic, enthusiastic, nervous, hesi-
tating, rash, wandering, painfully-slow, painfully-
sudden man whom everybody likes and nobody
quite trusts—seems almost on the verge of hang-
ing himself again. He hanged himself once (politi-
cally) along with Duncan Gillies. He hanged
himself once along with G. H. Reid. On each
occasion he was cut down before he was dead, and
his marvellous vitality brought him to complete
life again. Now every effort is being made to
persuade him to hang himself along with Joe
Cook. Deakin is an older man than he was, and
can’t stand hanging with the impunity of his
earlier days. And a great deal depends on the
kind of mate that a man hangs himself with. He
might hang himself with Duncan Gillies and
survive. He might hang himself with George
Reid and survive. It doesn’t necessarily follow
that he could hang himself with Joseph Cook and
survive.
■»•***
The Bulletin is quite willing to admit that
Deakin has received a vast amount of provoca-
tion. The Labor party is fair enough and honest
enough in its dealings with the country. In its
dealings with its Parliamentary allies (and such
an ally as William Lyne, for example, though
Lyne doesn’t sign the Labor pledge, is a far better
and far more advanced Democrat than many of
the Labor men) its conduct is often little short of
shameful. A constituency goes through three
phases. First it is Tory, and returnsa horrible back-
slider of the Bruce Smith persuasion. In that
period of its development Labor has generally left
it alone as a hopeless proposition. But the
Democrat of the Lyne, Deakin or Hume Cook
order gradually converts the constituency, and a
time comes when it returns a respectable Demo-
crat. Then, when the heaviest part of the work
is done, Labor puts up a candidate. Labor is a
hard master, reaping where it has not sowed, and
gathering where it has not strawed, as the Scrip-
ture puts the case. And the result is that either
the Democrat who stands outside the Labor ranks
has to retire, or else he and the Labor candidate
split the Democratic support, and the old Tory
backslider gets in on a minority vote, and the
cause of progress is lost. The result of the Labor
policy is that soon there will be no room
in Federal politics for good Democrats like
Lyne, Chapman, and Hume Cook ; and yet
there will be room for rampant Tories like
Bruce Smith and the other Cook (Joseph).
There will be no room for Deakin and Trenwith,
yet there will be room for Sayers and Chata-
way and St. Ledger. There will be a great
scarcity of space for Mauger, yet there
will be lots of accommodation for Bigjohn
Forrest and Pulsford and Albert Gould.
And one point which specially infuriates those
good Democrats who find themselves shoved out,
or in danger of being shoved out, by Labor com-
petitors, is that the Labor party is, in some
respects, most horribly Tory. It is, in some
respects, the party of cheap labor, low wages,
sweating and nigger and Chinese employment.
For the Labor party admits Freetraders into its
ranks—those hired minions of the importing
capitalist, who want to freely admit into Australia
the products of Chow and Jap and Hindu and
Kanaka cheap toil, the products of foreign non-
union labor and foreign sweated labor, and foreign
labor that works 12 hours a day for 2d. per hour,
in order to undersell and destroy Australian
industry and to kill off the decently-paid
White Australian workman. It is galling
to good Australian Democrats like Lyne
and Chapman and Hume Cook, who have
been for Australia all the time, to find their posi-
tions threatened, on the ground that they are not
good enough Democrats, by Freetrade Laborites
who are only disguised agents for the products of
the sweated nigger, and the sweated Mongol, and
the cheap non-unionist all the world over. It is
galling even for Deakin, who, with all his
brilliance, is not nearly so reliable a Democrat as
the men above enumerated. And yet, despite all
provocation, it isn’t worth Deakin’s while to
touch the unclean thing, and associate himself
with the political leprosy of Bruce Smith and
Joe Cook. He is, or should be, far too big a man
to go among the dogs and the monkeys and the
swine of politics. It would be far better to apply
for the High Commissionership, and retire from
the political arena for awhile. Then he might
return in better days, when things had so far
sorted themselves out that there would be scope
for his talents and his patriotism and his legitimate
ambitions.
■* * * *
If Alfred Deakin goes into coalition with
Cook and his friends there are certain sacrifices
which are inevitable. The first of these is the
Federal progressive land-tax, and it is regrettable
to notice that Deakin, in making the first
approaches to the Tory-Foreign-trade party, has
already thrown this overboard. He has joined
those who say that Federal land-taxation wasn’t
“contemplated” when the Constitution was
drafted; and that “contemplation” theory is
founded on the impudent proposition that the
people are bound, not so much by the contract
which was submitted to them and accepted by
them, as by the unsupported statements of various
people, to the effect that certain people, many of
whom are now dead, inwardly intended that the
Constitution should mean certain hidden things
which they never had the courage to pro-
pound to the nation, and which the nation
never endorsed. Alfred Deakin, as the
first sign of his unfortunate sloping towards
the political cavern of Cook, now regards
the graduated land-tax as a purely State matter.
Yet he can’t but know that a great part of his
owjn State is being made an unpeopled wilderness
of grass through the accumulation of great estates,
and that because of the great estates the popula-
tion is being driven away, until Victoria is little
better than a dying community. And because of
the property-elected Victorian Upper House —•
which, by reason of its property basis, is able to
defy the people —the State can’t get the progres-
sive land-tax which is necessary to its salvation.
To leave that matter to the State, when the State
is powerless, is merely adding insult to injury.
The Victorian Upper House defied the popular
will, as expressed in the People’s Chamber, by
rejecting the Woman’s Suffrage Bill for the best
part of 20 years; and if it was so brutally
retrogressive over a measure which didn’t
affect its pocket but merely its prejudices,
it is easy to imagine for how many scores
of years it would refuse to recognise the
popular will in the matter of a progressive land-
tax, in which its pocket is most intimately con-
cerned. In this matter it is impossible for
Alfred Deakin to join himself to Joseph Cook
without selling his own State to bondage, poverty,
misery, scorn, depopulation, backsliding, and a
poor and contemptible hinder seat among the
members of the Commonwealth. Victoria, which
led Australia until land-monopoly dragged it
down from its high estate, looks to Deakin, whom
it has regarded as its noblest son, to save it from
becoming the poorest and least-thought-of mem-
ber of the Union. It looks to Deakin to do this,
even though he should thereby lose a political job
or billet. And it isn’t worth while for Deakin to
keep a job or billet and sell the State which gave
him birth and raised him to honor.
* * * *
Again, it is impossible for Deakin to coalesce
with Cook save on the understanding that the
tariff is to remain unaltered, and that also isn’t
worth while. Such an understanding would mean
that the N.S.W. iron industry and theN.S.W. oil
industry must be thrown overboard, along with
many other possible industries. It is a grievous
fact that N.S.W., the State which owns these
great but dying enterprises, returns various
Foreign-trade members who want to butcher the
interests of their own country for the profit and
benefit of the foreign importer. It is an especially
grievous thing that there are various Foreign-
trade members of the Labor party who are ready
to kill these Australian industries, and to leave
the white Australian workmen hitherto employed
in them to starve, in order to boost the interests of
the U.S. Steel Trust or the employer of the cheap,
non-union, 12-hours-per-day nigger who pro-
duces oil in Borneo or Burmah. But even
amid all these complications and provoca-
tions it isn’t worth Deakin’s while to join
the anti-Australian Cook in this matter. The
salary would be there, and the portfolio; but
the portfolio would have blood on it—human
blood, the blood of the starved workmen and their
starved wives and children. Even if there is the
same blood on the Labor party’s portfolio that
wouldn’t make things any better for Deakin.
* ► * *
And, once more, it is impossible for Deakin to
join with Cook without associating himself indis-
solubly with the proposed Dreadnought swindle
and robbery. In that matter Deakin has already
gone much too far, but to join with Cook would
be to go so much further that any return would
be impossible. The proposed Dreadnought busi-
ness is plain robbery, fraud, stealing, embezzle-
ment, shortage in the cash, burglary, pocket-
picking, misappropriation of the trust money,
malversation, breach of faith and confidence trick.
To quote the language which Deakin himself
has used as a reason for not proceeding
with the progressive land-tax, the people
haven’t been consulted about it at a general
election. When the last Federal election hap-
pened “it was never contemplated” (to quote the
words which the Cook crowd is so fond of em-
ploying when it tries to point out that the
framers of the Constitution intended to leave
direct taxation to the States) that the Federal
taxpayers’ money should be used, without the tax-
payers’ consent, for the purchase of a warship for
England. The taxpayers have already done their
best to express their hostility to the absurd ea
by failing to subscribe more than a miserably
petty amount to the Dreadnought Fund, by allow-
ing Dreadnought meetings to lapse for want of
attendance, and by refusing in every way to
countenance the insanity. Any Government
which, under such circumstances, takes the
people’s coin without getting the people’s consent
per medium of a Referendum or a General Elec-
tion, and diverts it from the ordinary uses of
Australia into a subsidy for Britain, will
be as plain and ordinary a thief, and as
much deserving of gaol, as the clerk who
is short in his cash, or the solicitor whose
trust funds are missing. And for a man of
Deakin’s standing, this sort of thing isn’t worth
while.
• • * »
Lastly, if Deakin joins Cook, and thereby does
the thing that isn’t worth while, he must sacrifice
many of his best and noblest ambitions. If the
idea of raising much money by a progressive land-
tax is sacrificed, and the idea of obtaining further
revenue from the tariff is abandoned, then the
revenue will be less. And if the idea of fooling
away millions on the sensational presentation of a
Dreadnought to Britain is adopted, then the ex-
penditure will be a great deal more. And because
of this dislocation of the finances something must
go overboard. Either it will be necessary to sacri-
fice defence, or to indefinitely postpone the
annexation and development of the Northern
Territory, or to abandon the building of the two
most essential transcontinental railways. In one
way or another, the interests of Australia must
be thrown aside in order that a Cook-Deakin
coalition may destroy Australian industries for
the benefit of foreign workers (many of them
niggers, Asiatics and non-unionists), and embezzle
Australian revenue in order to present an un-
authorised ship to a country which doesn’t want
the darned old article. That sort of thing may
be good enough for Cook, but for Deakin—the
nervous, eloquent, brilliant, wandering, shifty,
but always at heart honest and patriotic Deakin
—the game isn’t good enough. It would be better
for Deakin to take the High Commissionership,
or to go on the Bench, or to go on the land, or to
return to journalism or the law, or even to retire
into obscurity and to pose as a monument of
national ingratitude, than to come to such a poli-
tical ending. The ending would be a fitting close
for the careers of many men, but it wouldn’t be a
fitting close for the career of the well-beloved
Alfred Deakin. In his case the thing is dis-
tinctly not worth while.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Word to Littlejohn.
The well-known Mr. Littlejohn, of Sydney (no
relation to Big John Forrest), who is one of the
most reliable Jeremiahs that the city possessess,
has again been bathed in woe over the alleged in-
juries and disabilities which Capital has to endure
in Australia. Because of these injuries and dis-
abilities, it seems, that terrified object, Capital, is
again fleeing from the country. But this sort of
thing isn’t new ; in fact, it has happened so often
that it grows burdensome. An impression begins
to grow on this paper that Mr. Littlejohn is a
morbid, soured, thankless and ill-balanced—not to
say ramshackle—grumbler, and that he doesn’t
know when he is well off. In fact, this paper is
so convinced of that fact that if the Littlejohn
person will gather up his duds and leave for
England, and give a bond in the sum of
£IOO that he will stay there or in adjacent
parts of Europe for the rest of his days,
it will gladly pay for his ticket (first-class and
by the best vessel on the line). It would
be a good thing for Australia if an ungrate-
ful cuss like Littlejohn, whose chief joy it
apparently is to object to the country which keeps
him in an affluence that he would probably never
attain anywhere else, should leave it; and his
departure would be very popular. On the other
hand, England is quite good enough for Little-
john.- In that country taxation is now fully £1
per inhabitant per annum higher than in Aus-
tralia. Littlejohn has been grumbling bitterly
at the Australian tariff, so it would perhaps be a
great benefit to him to try a country where there
is rather less of a tariff, but where the ruling power
has devised several hundred different methods of
direct taxation, till it has got things down
so fine that it has a special tax on house-
agents if they let furnished houses at a rent
exceeding 9s. 7d. per week. But though taxa-
tion is already so high in England—the place
that would just suit Littlejohn—it is going
to be increased, and if Littlejohn started now
he would get there just in time to pay his share of
the increase. That is one reason why The Bul-
letin is so anxious to buy his ticket. There has
been so much trouble of late that Britain has a
huge deficit, and it wants to raise another
£IG,GOO,OOO a year by extra taxation. So it is pro-
posed to raise £2,850,000 by new estate duties,
another £500,000 by increased land-tax, £G50,000
by increased stamp duties on share transactions;
to put another £G, 100,000 on liquor and tobacco,
and on rich men, like Littlejohn, who own
public-houses; to increase the income-tax on
a sliding scale, till a man with over £SOOO a year
will pay Is. Bd. in the £—which would be rough
on persons like Littlejohn ; to take, in addition
to the heavy estate duties already levied, and in
addition to the new estate duties that are pro-
posed, 20 per cent, of any increase in the value of
land, with a special tax on undeveloped land, and
on the supposed value of minerals unworked, but
alleged to exist; also, to levy taxes on motors,
motor-cycles, and petrol, and to do various
other matters. All these things would cheer
up Littlejohn if he went to live in England.
The new liquor and public-house taxes are so
tremendous that it is alleged that two big English
breweries will be struck- with £104,745 of extra
taxation per annum ; and as their united profits
last year were only £61,300, they say they can’t
pay the money. In fact, they seem to allege that
their capital may be driven out of the country,
and they may have to bring the wreck of their
fortunes to Australia, or some such place, and
start afresh. And according to the cable, one
big London hotel will have £G2SO a year
added to its license fee and a smaller one
will pay £4250 a year extra. Both the pubs
will also be driven out of the country for
certain. These painful circumstances would
justify Littlejohn in fleeing to England at this
juncture, if only to stem the rot that has set in.
The new British exactions, combined with a
slump of £115,000,000 in the year’s commerce,
would seem to have aroused Britain to sudden
fury. Apparently the people have realised that
unless they abandon their Freetrade, or partial
Freetrade, system, and proceed to make the
importer pay in dead earnest at the Customs
House, the burden of innumerable petty and
vexatious direct taxes will pile up and up and UP
till there will even be a tax on cats, with a
specially heavy duty on tortoiseshell cats, and a
possible rebate on the tailless Manx variety,
because there is less of the Manx pussy. So
things have begun to happen. The first chance
that the English people had of expressing their
views, after the announcement of the new taxes,
was at the Stratford-on-Avon election. At last
general election Captain Smith, Liberal and
Freetrader, was returned by 4321 votes, against
his opponent’s 4173. Smith resigned on a small
dispute with his party over military matters, and
asked the electors to declare their continued con-
fidence in him. They didn’t. They gave 5374
votes to a new Protectionist candidate, and Free-
trader Smith could only rake up 479 supporters.
This so disgusted Smith that he has turned Pro-
tectionist himself. These events suggest another
reason why people like Littlejohn, who object so
bitterly to the Australian tariff, should hasten to
England and settle there. By using all due
velocity they might reach London just in time to
meet a Protectionist tariff, and an income-tax of
Is. Bd. in the £, to say nothing of the estate
duties, the land-tax, the 20 per cent, tax on the
unearned increment, the poor rates, police rates
and all the sundries. (Land in England, it must
be remembered, pays about 10 separate State
and local taxes, and the local taxes reach to
about 7s. in the £.) But it is satisfactory to
remember that, even if Littlejohn goes, there
are plenty of people who are willing to remain.
Australia is a fairly good place to Hive in. The
prosperity of a country can be gauged to some
extent by its banking profits, and one notable
Australian bank —the Australasia—has just shown
that its profits for the last two years were over
£400,000 per annum. That is almost equal to all
the profits made by all the banks of India, where
none of the conditions which so annoy Littlejohn
are to be found. The figures suggest that Aus-
tralia is a rather decent place for the capitalist.
If Littlejohn doesn’t think so there is nothing to
prevent his departure. This paper will buy his
ticket.

The Tasmanian Surprise.
Old Tasmania has been struck with the shock of
its life by the election of a dozen Labor members
to a House of Assembly which numbers 30 all
told. This nominally leaves Captain and Premier
Evans with a following of 18, but when indepen-
dents and sundries are deducted, the probabilities
are that Premier and Ancient Mariner Evans will
find himself in a very poor minority. And yet, so
far as State Legislation is concerned, the Tas-
manian Labor party has achieved little or nothing.
The property-elected Upper House—the House of
Dodery—is still strong to reject every Democratic
measure that comes before it, and to keep Tas-
mania down in the rut of poverty, illiteracy,
backwardness and decay which has been its regu-
lar habitation ever since the House of Dodery
first existed. The hope of the future lies in the
State Labor party throwing its weight and
influence into the Federal Unification and
Reconstruction movement. The idea of that
movement is that the people of the Com-
monwealth should, by a popular vote,
hand over to the Australian Parliament all the
State powers, privileges, assets, debts and mis-
cellaneous liabilities in one stupendous deed of
centralisation, and thus leave all the Houses of
Dodery stranded high and dry on the rock of
oblivion. Then the Australian Parliament is to
divide the Commonwealth into smaller and more
manageable States, and furnish each with
a Legislature of one House, based on adult
suffrage and having such powers as it is fitting
that a State Legislature should possess. Tas-
mania is so small that it is almost certain that in
its case there would be no subdivision. The island
State would remain, in that sense, as it is. The
change would lie in the fact that, perhaps on
January 1, the whole powers of the present House
of Assembly and the present impossible, obstruc-
tive, property-elected House of Dodery would
cease, and Tasmania would be governed from the
Federal capital instead of from its own capital at
Hobart. Then, perhaps on March 1, the man-
date would come to elect a new Assembly on
pure adult suffrage lines, with no impos-
sible, property-elected House of Dodery as
an appendage, and the island would resume
business at the old address, but under brighter
auspices. The interval need not be so long as
that which now ordinarily exists between the end
of one session and the beginning of the next; the
only difference being that during the interval
Prime Minister Fisher or some such person would
be at the head of affairs, instead of an individual
like Captain and Premier Evans. Then when
Parliament met again the old burden and curse
and dead-weight would be gone, and Tasmania
would be free to work out its own salvation. In a
mere three months the island would have risen
from the dead. Even if the Labor party secures a
powerful majority in the House of Assembly, it
can do little on the old State lines while the pro-
perty-elected Upper Chamber is on hand to throw
out all its reforms. It may do even less good than
Evans would do, for the Upper House will pro-
bably throw out in its case mere routine measures
which it would pass if they were introduced by an
Evans —throw them out by reason of sheer
cussedness. But as a missionary force, preaching
the Unification and Reconstruction gospel to the
people, it should be in a position to do great
service. The great point about the Unification
and Reconstruction movement is that it doesn’t
require the consent of the House of Dodery.
4,
The Empire’s View of the Australian
Defence Problem.
One of the contentions that the Joe Cook or Hired
Defence party advances as a reason why Australia
should not build and man war vessels of its own,
but should rather subsidise the Ma Land to keep
it inviolate, is that the mercenary policy is essential
to prevent the break-up of the Empire. It is sug-
gested that the uprising in the Pacific of an Aus-
tralian fleet would be a prelude to the bursting up
of that area on which the sun is unable to set.
Fisher and Deakin and those who think with
• them on naval questions are represented by the
Hired Defence crowd as going, in the most
mule-headed fashion, right against the opinion
of every other portion of the Empire, spurred
on thereto by a malign wish to do injury
to the glorious institution which B. Smith
lives to boost up. Loose-tongued people like the
dreadful Johnson, M.P., say this sort of thing
aloud in public places. They openly accuse the
advocates of an Australian fleet of an in-
sensate ambition to train Australian guns on
British ships. And others, who are more


cautious, whisper the same slander in private.
They represent the cowards and crawlers of the
community, who seek to avoid responsibility,
and the danger of personal service, and the burden
of paying our fair share of the cost of naval de-
fence, by presenting Britain, amid tremendous
applause, with one scrappy ship, and leaving Britain
to find the men and officers, and experience and
knowledge and capacity for management, also the
cost of maintenance and repairs. On the other sid.e
of the question there is the fact that the Cana-
dian Government, headed by that fervent Im-
perialist, Wilfrid Laurier, was so impressed
with the sanity of the Fisher naval proposals
that it decided, a few days ago, to pay the policy
the high compliment of imitating it in the
Dominion. And this is how a typical Crown
colony views the question. The extract is from a
Times of Ceylon editorial (28/3/’O9): —
Calm consideration should show us that Australia cer
tainly, and Canada probably, would be much wiser to set in
earnest about protecting their own shores than to present
one or more Dreadnoughts to the British Navy. Facts
need to be broadly faced, and unfortunately this is what
a good many keen patriots prefer not to do when they
are dealing with British Imperialism. It would be
criminal folly for Australians to believe that a gif t of Dread-
noughts to the Royal Navy would ensure that, under any
and all circumstances, British ships, British officers and
British men would be sent to the Southern seas to defend
Australia from attack. A mere glance at the relative
strength of naval armaments in Europe will show how
impossible it would be even to-day for any very consider-
able section of the British fleet to go so far afield as
Australian waters, and it will be still more difficult when
Germany’s strength approximates more nearly to the
money she is spending and is prepared to spend and to the
enthusiasm of the German nation for a powerful fleet.
Japan is always the potential foe of the Australians, and
the mutability of international policy, and the instability
of treaty relations, are sufficient reasons for mistrust of
an ambitious and numerous people at present leagued
with Great Britain in ties of amity and mutual interest.
If Australia will develop the policy of an Australian navy,
which Captain Cresswkll adumbrated, and which has in
part been given effect to recently, she will be doing a
real service to her own people and also to the Royal navy.
A fools’ paradise is not a place in which to live when its
deficiencies as a residence have been found out and
enlightened. Australians must have learnt from the in-
creasing difficulty with which Britain is able to stave off
German challenges of naval supremacy, and the bitter
hostility with which a powerful section of the House of
Commons invariably greets all increased naval expendi-
ture, that they are not justified in leaving the defence of
Australia to the British fleet.
The country where the Times of Ceylon hangs
out has everything to gain and nothing to lose if
the British fleet is augmented at the expense of
Australia. The bulk of its population will never
train into soldiers or sailors. The island’s whole
prosperity and safety depend on the supremacy
of the British navy. Yet the white men who run
the paper are driven against their own personal
interests to laud the worthiness and reasonable-
ness of Australia’s ambition to rise in defence
matters above the standard set by Cingalee
coolies and Indian babus. For niggers, protection
by a suzerain Power for a cash consideration is
well enough. But that is no policy for a self-
respecting white community, and none recognises
it more warmly than the white men who dwell in
black communities. And if one of the Joe Cook
type told them not only that it was a sound
policy for white men, but also that any other
sort of policy was “disloyalty to the flag,” they
would regard the speaker as a very mad person
indeed.

Neglected Melbourne.
Melbourne’s port accommodation is a topic that
permeates the columns of the local papers these
days. The said accommodation is shockingly
served and shockingly neglected—especially for
corpulent, deep-sea vessels of great tonnage.
These aldermen amongst steamships are furnished
with berthing space comparable in badness to a
cheap and scanty dosshouse. They have really
only the Port Melbourne Railway Pier at which
to tie up and slumber; and it not infrequently
happens that, when a small herd of obese liners
call at the same time for a night’s lodging, there
are not enough bunks for the would-be bunkers.
The result is that the first half-dozen of the herd
are served with bedding of a sort, while the rear
guard are forced to suspend on the doormat, as it
were, until a bed becomes empty. This leads to
bad temper and wounded feelings. Yet, if the
pier accommodation is silly in its poverty, the
docking ditto is insane in its antiquity and
unsuitableness. Apart from the private, fairly
modern, but small docks on the Yarra, there
is only the Alfred Dock at Williamstown
which can pretend to be a dock at all.
Even it is utterly out of date —it has never been
improved or enlarged since its birth in 1874,
and it is only adequate for the indispositions of
the mere dinghies in marine architecture. It is a
mere 450 ft. long on the bottom, and, if it were re-
quested, in an emergency, to succor a sea-going
pub like, say, the Morea, it would have to sub-
edit the palace by nearly 100 ft. to get it, or
a bit of it. comfortably tucked in, or else take it
as a serial, 100 ft. or so at a time. Practically
every large steamship that sneaks warily into
Melbourne’s front room would find the Alfred
Dock too short for it, and probably too narrow.
The consequence is that Melbourne, being un-
able to provide a decent boarding-house
or hospital for the boats with the mammoth
equators, is degenerating into a mere port of call.
Other cities have plentiful docking accommoda-
tion, but Melbourne has practically none. It is
obvious that its indifference, or the Government’s
indifference to its needs, will hinder its reputa-
tion, its trade and its possibilities as a naval port
—that is, in the long run ! But the Murray
Government turns to the subject of port-improve-
ment with an indolent eye, and doubtless observes
that the run has quite'a long time to run yet.

An Absurd Proposal.
From the Sydney Morning Herald (5/5/’O9): —
Mr. Deakin’s position is now the centre of interest. Is
he likely to come into line with Mr. Cook, and heartily
join hands with him in the coalition, without which
progress is impossible? YVe see no reason why he should
hesitate for a moment.
It suggests that the Herald isn’t in the habit of
reading its own news; so that it is ignorant of
the radically diverse political opinions of the
party leaders whom it wants to bring together.
There is but one condition on which two poli-
ticians who have committed themselves as deeply
in the press and on the platforms as Deakin and
Cook have can coalesce — viz. , a shamelessly cyni-
cal jettisoning of principles on one side or the
other. No party which holds Cook, B. Smith,
W. E. Johnson, and Willy Kelly can, without
arousing the derision of the whole of Australia,
hold a man with the Defence views of Alfred
Deakin. Cook, B. Smith, Johnson, Kelly and
the rest have pronounced so definitely against citi-
zen service—or, as they term it bitterly, “ conscrip-
tion”—that any attempt on their part to back down
and acquire new Defence views.must stultify them
utterly. The position is the same on the Aus-
tralian navy question. Johnson— he who hails
from Lang—has given it as his sober opinion that
anyone who panders to this scheme is a “dis-
loyalist,” imbued with a bloodthirsty intention
of turning on the Motherland, and blowing her
ships out of the sea. And to this theory Willy
Kelly has said “ Hear ! Hear!” in a voice shaken
with emotion ; and B. Smith has endorsed it, and
promised to do all he can to avert the ultimate
disaster by bringing the entire force of the British
Empire League of Australia to bear on the situa-
tion. Furthermore, this weirdly illogical crew
lias chorussed that, as a matter of fact,
no Australian navy, manned by Australian
sailors, can, in any case, ever be of the
slightest value to those who own it, or in
any way dangerous to a civilised enemy. (This,
on the general Freetrade and Anti-Sosh principle,
that the Australian, as such, is necessarily useless
and incompetent.) Also, it has dwelt with a sort
of joyous scorn on the appalling thrashing an Aus-
tralian “ mosquito ” or other fleet would get if it
ventured to tackle an in vader; and i t has insisted on
the futility of this rich country, with its population
of nearly 5,000,000, dreaming of defending itself for
“another half-century at least.” These are the
insane Defence opinions that Alfred Deakin
must father if he throws in his lot with the Cook
faction. Cook and his allies talk “fiscal peace,”
and the fact is thrust forward as an allurement to
Deakin. It is doubtful, however, (1) if the
CooK-ites are sincere when they do so, (2) if they
will be allowed to be sincere by those who put
them where they are. A sample of the way the
Freetrader who has not got the sweets of office
dangling before him as a reward of his fiscal apos-
tacy takes the proposed De akin-Cook alliance may
be found in a letter of A. G. Huie’s which the
Sydney dailies published (6/5/’O9). Huie wrote :
There has been a good deal in the papers lately in favor
of a Cook-Df.akin alliance. It is easy enough for some
people to talk about what they think should be done.
There is another side to the question. How will the
people regard it ? Can such a union command public
confidence and respect? All our experience is against
such a conclusion. ... I have not the least doubt that
any further rapprochment of Freetraders and Protec-
tionists will be a bad thing for Freetrade. When men
like the members of the so-called Liberal and Progressive
League want to work with Freetraders, it is evident that
they are hard pressed. ... It has been pointed out that
Protection is a form of Socialism. If we are to oppose
Socialism, it must be on Freetrade lines. Mr. Cook must
look to the democratic Freetraders.
And a lot more to the same effect. Which ex-
presses the attitude of a big section of importer-
dorn with much accuracy. And herein there is
the additional factor to be considered, that
Deakin —while there still remain tariff anomalies
to be rectified—cannot declare consistently for
fiscal peace. Deakin and his following, and Cook
and his following are completely at variance
over the Navigation Bill. If Deakin lets
the Bill go by the board he will violate
a score of pledges; if Cook supports it
he will be justifiably assailed by the Anti-
Sosh press as a turn-coat and a prevaricator and a
dishonest knave generally. In any Deakin-Cook
combination that is not going to he hopelessly at
loggerheads, either Deakin must turn State-
Frighteror Cook must drop being anti-Australian.
Either contingency is too painful and unlikely for
consideration. And the Sydney dailies ask
Deakin to put himself in all these wildly false
positions in the cause of Anti-Sosh—in the cause,
that is to say, of the policy which Deakin de-
nounced three years ago as a “flagrant elec-
tioneering bogey ”of G. Reid’s. The idea of
Alfred Deakin throwing overboard, at the in-
stance of the papers which have always reviled and
misrepresented him, all the doctrines he has been
preaching since last Federal elections, in order to
battle for a political creed which he has con-
sistently denounced as fraudulent humbug, reads
like a joke pure and simple—and not even a good
joke at that.
The Gospel of Discontent.
The trial for sedition of Henry Holland, at
Albury (N.S.W.), reeked with astounding state-
ments by all parties ; but easily the most amazing
of them all was that of Crown Prosecutor Lamb,
that it is against the law “to promote discontent.”
Mr. Lamb stated that this was ruled by Chief
Justice Fitzgerald, so it came under the heading
of “Judge-made law.” (Justice Pring, at this
same trial, went out of his way to declare that
there was no such thing as “Judge-made
law.”) But Lamb carefully forgot to state
why an Australian should be jugged because
an Irish Judge made an asiniho statement. For,
if the alleged learned Judge ever ruled anything
of the sort in the way indicated by Mr.
Lamb, he was much more fit to ornament
a lunatic asylum than adorn the judicial
bench. Such a ruling is calculated to bring
all government and all legal luminaries into
utter contempt. Without discontent there can be
no human progress in any direction. The impulse
to lead a better life is the result of profound dis-
content with the life being actually led. Accord-
ing to this remarkable ruling, every preacher
of religion or ethics, every school-teacher, all
doctors who lecture on how to our
race and lengthen our lives, are criminals. These
progress associations of which we hear so much
are illegal bodies —they exist to promote discon-
tent. According to his own prosecutor and the
ruling of Chief Justice Fitzgerald, Mr. Wade
himself, when he stirred up the Willoughby
electors to discontent with the See Government,
should have been gaoled as a promoter of discord.
Even the position of Mr. Lamb itself is doubtful.
If he did not actually promote discontent in others
he practised it in his own case. There was a day
when he was making a very fair living as a capable
law reporter. But he was discontented with that
station of life to which it had pleased God to call
him, and by practising his discontent in a practical
way he became a barrister and attained to affluence.
In fact, Mr. Lamb is one of the worst examples of
discontent. The whole theory is absurd, and if
the statement had anything to do with Holland’s
conviction, then Holland has been persecuted
and not prosecuted, and his sentence is a crime.
Meanwhile it is difficult to imagine any sentence
that is long enough to suit Lamb’s case, or any
gaol big enough to bear any reasonable proportion
to his enormity. A man who tries to put down
discontent —the one thing that keeps the world
moving and improving, and without which every-
thing would be dead with a dead ness that no lan-
guage can describe —is a public enemy of such a
bad kind that there is no other public enemy like
him.

Another Locked-up Land Swindle.
Melbourne Age lately put its finger on another
detail of the ghastly farce of land settlement in
Victoria the shepherding of grazing leases.
While Bent was blathering about his gilt-edged
Closer Settlement scheme, and while Murray
talks vaguely about doing something to settle the
lands, the blessed State has actually 3,402,530
acres of good soil held under grazing lease—
that is to say it has enough land practi-
cally locked up to support 12,000 families. If
the State leased these lands at something like
their honest value Or at a competitive rental,
lots of farmers would enthusiastically take hold
and put them to their full use, but the fool
State merely asks a rent of from Id. to
3d. per acre per annum, and the lands have
been allowed to drop into the hands of specu-
lators, who put them to practically no use,
but merely hold for a “rise.” When the in-
creasing scarcity of land, or the advent of popula-
tion, has brought about this “ rise,” the specula-
tor can select from 200 to 900 acres—according to
quality—at from 10s. to £1 per acre, and by marvel-
lous generosity— he is allowed to deduct the rent he
has paid through the previous years off the purchase
price. The result is that his speculation costs him
nothing, and he has the use of the land for many
years for nothing, and then ends up by getting
the freehold of a great area of it at about one-fifth
or one-tenth its value. And even when this
swindle is completed the State by no means re-
covers possession of the rest of the lease. The
lessee’s wife, and every one of his sons and
daughters who are aged over 18 may each select
from 200 to 960 acres on the same terms of raving
lunacy. Also, the lessee may, by departmental
permission, sublet or transfer the surplus part of
his lease—at great profit to himself. All these
leases expire automatically on December 29, 1920,
but by that time there won’t be much unselected
land left. An instance is given of the blastiferous
folly, or swindle, of the whole proceeding. Around
Hamilton, in the rich Western District, no less
than 77 of the leases comprise over 1000 acres
each, and aggregate nearly 100,000 acres. The
rent the State receives for this huge area is just
£393 ss. 4d. per annum ; at least, that is what it
ought to get, but the arrears at present amount to
£179 2s. 3d.—one lessee of 1204 acres at £5 os. 4d.
per year is actually over three years behind.
The State never dreams of ejecting the
man who doesn’t pay. So the position is
that the State is actually .leasing that
principality at one penny per acre per annum,
in a district where the private landlord gets 30s.
per acre per annum ; it doesn’t even get the whole
of that paltry penny ; and when the land is finally
selected at tiie absurd price of from 10s. to 20s. per
acre, the asinine State hands back its penny of rent
to the selector, who has had the use of the land
all along. Of course Hamilton isn’t the only dis- .
trict where this swindle has been worked ; it goes
on all over the State, over three-and-a-half million
acres ! Even Fisher’s proposed land-tax will not
correct this swindle —only the hanging of the
House of Fat Landlords could do that—but, by
reason of its being levied on an honest estimate of
the unimproved value, it will suddenly abolish
quite a lot of shepherding, and indirectly induce
the settlement of perhaps 2,000,000 acres.
Two Millions Sterling to Save Some Papers’
Faces.
A Reuter’s message which was published (5/5/’O9)
drove yet another nail in the coffin of the Dread-
nought foolishness. It stated that British Prime
Minister Asquith had mooted a conference be-
tween the self-governing Dominions —
To discuss the naval and military defence of the Em-
pire, with special reference to the proposals received
from Canada, Australia, and Maoriland.
The Times, in a leader applauding Asquith’s idea,
betrays considerable knowledge of the state of
affairs in Greater Britain when it remarks that-r-
It lias become increasingly clear, as the mails bring
fuller accounts of the Dreadnought movement, and the
state of public feeling' in the Dominions, that while all
parties and sections are eager to assume some greater
share of the responsibilities of naval defence, there is con-
siderable doubt and disagreement concerning the manner
in which the share of each can best be assumed.
And another great daily notes that: —
The Dominions will certainly prefer to spend their own
money in their own way, but there is no reason why the
respective fields of expenditure should not be marked out
by agreement, so as to secure the maximum benefit for
the Empire as a whole.
Naturally, since the above constitute a frank
admission that there is no “ unanimous and over-
whelming enthusiasm” whatever in the self-
governing dependencies on behalf of the absurd
presentation Dreadnought scheme, the Sydney
Telegraph, which has alleged that there is, and
is hopelessly committed to that view, grows
alarmed. It said, agitatedly, on the morning it
printed the foregoing items :
Australia, however, cannot leave the Dreadnought
scheme to any such conference. The definite offer must
go to the Motherland, conference or no conference. What
the Motherland chooses to do with it is her concern, and
will bo a lit subject for the conference to discuss.
Of course, to leave the consideration of the
“Dreadnought scheme” to any sane conference
would mean that it would fall dead at once. It
has been evident for weeks that Britain wants
something more rational than Dreadnought money
from the outlying parts of the Empire. Asquith
has spilled the coldest of douches on M.L.’s
frantic offer of “ a Dreadnought—or two, if neces-
sary,” by telling that CoHEN-mad spot that its
proffered vessel, or vessels, will only be con-
ditionally accepted. The London correspondent
of the only Sydney newspaper which is running a
Dreadnought fund of its own, alleged, the week
before last, that the basis of the whole agitation
was nothing more than a move on the part of the
BALFOUU-ites to put the present British Govern-
ment out of office. Even assuming that Britain
yearned for Dreadnoughts from the outlying
States of the Empire, there is the painful con-
sideration that these countries can’t build them,
and don’t propose to man, repair, or maintain
them. Moreover, they simply propose to borrow
or burgle the money and have the vessels built on
British slips. But there are none of the latter
empty, nor are there likely to be for an indefinite
time to come. Still there remains the frantic
allegation—so far as this part of the Empire is con-
cerned—that it is so wild to hurl a Dreadnought
at the Motherland, whether the latter wants it
or not, that it won’t rest comfortably till it has
done so; and, further, that it has offered a Dread-
nought “in spirit,” and that it will be disgraced
if one doesn’t go, no matter how often or how
strongly any Imperial Defence Conference pro-
nounces against it. There has been a world of
daily newspaper noise in this regard, but it is
hard to see where and when the Australian people
have committed themselves to the giving of any
Dreadnought. Andrew Fisher, Prime Minister
of Australia, has denounced the movement from
the start as hysteria, and refused to be associated
with it. Both Wade (of N.S.W.) and Murray
(of Victoria) condemned it till they were seized,
figuratively, by the scruff of the neck,
and run, by their journalistic masters, into
the Jingo cave. The other State Premiers
are, and always have been, frankly hostile.
As to the alleged hankering of the people to buy
their defence in this way, for six weeks the morn-
ing dailies of N.S.W. and Victoria have been
booming the proposal wildly. They have, given,
among them, many hundreds of pounds worth
of free advertising space to it. There have been
meetings in a host of Town Halls, Little Bethels,
and Abernethy Tabernacles on behalf of the
movement. And what has been the response to
these efforts? WLen there are deducted from
the Fund, as it stands, the £40,000 promised by
Messrs. Hall, Dangar, Buchanan, and Hor-
dern, and the further £IO.OOO promised by
Hordern in the impossible event of a
second Dreanought being offered, and the
£IOOO of Allen Taylor, we find that the people
—those who are represented as being mad
for the scheme—have weighed in with the amaz-
ingly unimpressive sum of £15,000. To gauge
the paltriness of this contribution in a rich and
generous community like this it is only necessary
to consider that in one day and in one city the
hospitals scored recently in the neighborhood of
£lo,ooo— nearly two-thirds of the sum the Dread -
noughters have taken a month and a half to
garner in from the general body of the populace.
Items like the following, clipped from a recent
issue of the Telegraph, are significant
At the meeting of the Newcastle municipal council last
njo-ht the Mayor, Aid. J. 0. Reid, said that, so far, he had
received no subscriptions tow&rds the Diendnpujrnt
Fund, and he did not intend to take any action in the
matter unless he was given the support of the aldermen.
And this:—
Morke.—At a meeting of the Boomi Shire Council the
Lord Mayor’s appeal for the Dreadnought fund was held
over for one month. , Cr. Scott dissenting.
Also this :
Walcha.— The postponed Dreadnought meeting fell
through here on Thursday, owing to the small attend-
ance.
And in the face of this sort of thing, the dailies,
which have engineered the fiasco, the
effrontery to call it a “national movement, ’ and
clamor that the country shall foot the bill for it at
any price. The truth is that it has been, from start
to finish, a Tory newspaper movement. The
papers have dropped in badly. Their present
pleasing idea is to charge Australia with the task
of saving their faces in the matter. It is suggested
that the Commonwealth shall blew £2,000,000 on
a Dreadnought it doesn’t want to provide, for a
Government that owns it is going to be pro-
foundly embarrassed with the gift if the thing is
forced on it. The Australian people are asked,
as it were, in the sacred names of patriotism and
duty, to pay the fine and Costs "of their news-
papers’ drunk. It is confidence business of the
most patent and shameless brand.
Our Daily Sausage.
Within the last few weeks two Anti-Socialistic
farmers of considerable tonnage in the Vic.
Western District have been haled before the
Court to answer charges of forwarding diseased
meat to Melbourne. One farmer was heayily
fined ; the other’s case broke down on a technical
point. The diseased meat in question was sick
pig, and in each case an attempt had been made
to'deceive by cutting away the diseased portion of
the animal. All through the year, an enormous
amount of meat, dead and alive, is sent to Mel-
bourne from the country districts. The live por-
tion is usually fairly sound as it has to pass
muster at the city abattoirs. But the dead section
of the trade is something worse than horrible. At
one time it was almost impossible to write about
it without feeling ill; but since the introduction
of stricter inspection things have slightly im-
proved. The improvement, however, is so com-
paratively slight that the man who eats anything
in Melbourne except plain beef or mutton, from
a good shop, pretty well takes his life in
his mouth. The consumer of either pork or
German sausage takes just about the same risk as
a man in a flying machine. For it is the pleasant
custom of the Anti-Socialistic farmer to try and
smuggle his uneatable dead meat down to the
city ; and when the inspector stops the smellful
stuff in transit, the farmer roars loudly about
“inquisitorial methods” and “interference with
trade.” All the old, worn-out bulls in the dairying
districts, with flesh resembling doormats, are shot
down to Melbourne or one of the other big towns.
Some time ago, when the Melbourne inspectors
were unusually active, the trade turned to
Adelaide, and there was a fearsome rush of old
bulls to the Western District markets while the
Adelaide buyers were about. These old bulls are,
of course, uneatable as beef; but they are chopped
up, and form the basis of the well-known and
popular German sausage. Venerable and almost
equally tough cows go the same way. There
is also a constant procession of dead meat
which was once old boar or elderlv sow or
other ailing and decrepit swine; that, in a
living stage, were useless for sale-yards pur-
poses. The buyers for the big bacort factories
take all the good pig 3 ; the sausage vendors in
Melbourne get the rest. The largest, oldest and
The Message of Fat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The leader of Deform arose upon his hinder limbs
To give his Tory message—and the listening
Bills and Jims,
According to their mental states, called out
“ Plooray ! ” or “Rats ! ”
Or stamped and yelled, or groaned, or just sat
dumbly on their hats.
“’Ear, ’ear!” “Quite right!” “Hooray!”
remarked the brainy, old J.P.’s
Arranged along the platform with their hands
upon their knees.
“’Ear, ’ear!” the fat, old farmers gruffed, and
cheered him with their boots,
And when he spoke of Socialists the ladies
screamed “ The brutes !”
All up and down the scale of shrieking Anti-
Sosh, and such,
.His Nibs the orator went wild ; he talked exceed-
ing much
Of crying needs and freedom—yes, of freedom
and of slaves,
Of blind and blithering Labor fools, and scurvy
Labor knaves.
And in the midst of all this talk plain William
Smith got up,
And plunged from out the sweltering pack to go
and take a sup
At Murphy’s pub. The leader stayed and went
on talking there—
Wild prophecies, and wilder plans, flag-flapping
and hot air.
“ Hooray ! ” the meeting shouted —and Plain
William ambled out
To seek a pub and pal, and shout another kind of
shout!
And, as he stumbled down the steps and through
the crowd outside,
He met Jim Brown. “ Wot ho !” said Bill, and
Jimmy Brown replied,
“ Ho, Bill ! That bloke kin talk orright—’e
must ’ave made a hit.
Tell us wot ’e was talkin’ of!” Plain William
thought a bit,
And looked up road and down in a bewildered
kind of way,
“Why, blimey, JIH,” he growled at last, “the
blighter didn’t say 1”

Our boys in England are giving further
evidence of the enduring vigor and activity of the
race. An activity which, directed by a high form
of wisdom, that inspired by D.C.L. Whisky for
choice, is irresistible in progressive achievement.
D.C.L., the scholarly brand, is known to the wise
as the guiding spirit of beneficent activities.
least toothsome boar that this writer ever saw was
sent to the city in this way, and realised a re-
markable price. His proper destination was a
bone and manure mill; but the label on him was
that of a city produce-salesman. To dodge the in-
spectors, the farmers now, as the cases mentioned
indicate, use their skill to disguise the age and
health of the dead meat; and it thus possible to
get a lot of rubbish past even the most watchful
officials. The trade in “slinks” (newly-born
calves) is still flourishing mightily. Thousands of
these abominations go down to Melbourne every
year from the dairying districts ; and the carcases
brihg such good prices that it may be suspected
that a fair proportion of them masquerade as
prime veal, the balance being converted into
Frankfurts and other sausages. The flesh of the
“slinks” cannot possibly be wholesome, as the
calves are killed either immediately after birth or
within three or four days. But no one seems to
trouble about the matter, and Melbourne eats its
daily sausage calmly and contentedly.

for Goalishin, et sed.
On Monda it reminded Alf that he was fated ter meet

His “ Noo Pratection,” it assured him, was puffetly

N.S.W.’s precious Closer Settlement Act is leak-
ing in another place. The measure permits cer-
tain, applicants who acquire land under its pro-
visions to reside in the nearest town, and occupy
their holdings per medium o'f deputies. Regarded
superficially, this provision looked a beneficent
one—it was intended to give the prolific sort of
cocky a chance to have his numerous progeny edu-
cated ; also to allow the weak or fragile descrip-
tion of Hayseed to get proper medical attention,
etc. But the land-speculator chuckled gleefully
when he saw what that provision was loaded with,
and forthwith set out to give country Land Boards
an awful time. Wagga Board had a particularly hot
morning lately while dealing with the Gobbagum-
balin resumed area. In one typical case, the alleged
landholder was running a lucrative business in
town, and submitted as his deputy a youth of 76.
The dummy—pardon, deputy—was to receive ss.
a week, and all the rabbits he could run down.
The Board looked askance at the 76-year-old, and
the landholder instantly brought out another line
of goods, warranted “only 70 last birthday.”
The weary Board didn’t think he was exactly the
sort of make-shift backbone the country wanted
either; and while the holder went cheerfully off
to dig up some more wreckage, the Court bogged
into a very lop-sided case under the share system.
(Here again the nominal holder was a Wagga
business man.) Later, the Board made ominous
remarks about “dummying” and “sweating”;
also it couldn’t help thinking that, given a little
more rope and just a trifle additional pliability
on the part of the Lands Minister, the Act was
capable of achieving some surprising results.
From the S. M. Herald (30/4/’O9): —
A correspondent has written with regard to an experi-
ence of two young men who applied for a conditional
purchase lease on the North Coast. They approached
the Lands Department, asking for details of available
settlement land in that locality. To this they received
no official reply, but the post brought them circulars
from two firms of land agents. . . . The opening-
paragraph of one ran : “ We have been informed by the
Under-Secretary for Lands that you are desirous of select-
ing land on the North Coast,” etc. . . . The outstanding
portion of the letter, after the information that the Under-
secretary for Lands had informed the firm that the young
men were applicants, was a paragraph which stated that
this firm had had a surveyor on the land for some weeks,
and he had picked out the best blocks of 1280 acres each, and
on the payment of a fee of £SO the applicants could have
a 1280-acre block. “We may mention that there will be
no balloting. Each client will be allotted a separate
block, either to take or leave, as he decides.” . . . Mr.
McDonald, Under-Secretary to the Lands Department,
when seen on the subject of the letter, said it was a
common practice for agents to make application to the
Information Bureau of the Lands Department for the
names of persons desiring to secure land, and the in-
formation was willingly supplied; the Department was
glad to furnish it as an aid to the work of settlement.
The members of this particular firm were people who had
been formerly connected with the Lands Department....
Now it seems to be up to the Minister for Lands
to inform the Information Bureau that it exists to
help the small man who is looking for land, and
not to steer large fees into the pockets of a class
of which this country is tired and very mistrust-
ful. He might then whisper to the Correspond-
ence Branch, or whatever it is dubbed, that it
exists to answer letters sent to the Department,
and not to hand over the work to the above-
mentioned unnecessary agents. Likewise, he
might impress upon the controllers of this institu-
tion that £SO is a heap of cash to the average land-
seeker, and would be better employed in almost
any other way than in fattening land-agents.
That would be about as much as a Deform Minis-
ter could V>e expected to do in a term of three
years ; but if he had any spare time he might
emphasise the fact upon all and sundry in the
smellful premises in Spring-street, that they can
and should do for the landseeker everything that
the agents do, and do it for nothing.
The abounding impudence of Private Enterprise
was exemplified by a request lately made to Vic.
Minister of Agriculture Graham by certain
butchers, who are also meat-exporters and owners
of cold stores. Wholly ignoring the fact that the
State, by running the city cold stores for some
years at a great loss, had built up, extended and
organised" the meat export trade to the great en-
richment of these same butchers, the conscience-
less flesh-merchants demanded that the State
should not further compete with them. Not only
that, but they wanted the Government to stop
the Geelong Harbor Trust from erecting stores.
Fortunately Graham gave little satisfaction,
being “anxious not to let the producer and con-
sumer be squeezed by private companies,” and ad-
mittedly fearful of a ring. The deputation referred
to Swinburne’s half-promise to accede to their
wishes; but Graham replied that Swinburne
wasn’t in office just now. Remembering the evi-
dence lately given in Westralia as to the capers of
the “ meat ring ” and the haunting suspicion as to
the existence of similar dodges in other cities, one
is staggered at the assumption of these “enter-
prising ” butchers. Furthermore, considering that
the meat is produced, not by them, but by the
pastoralists and farmers of the State, and that
English and Australian citizens in general are the
consumers of the said meat, the assumption by
these chop and steak pedlars that they are the
only persons to be considered was something
stupendous. But it was so like Private Enter-
prise.

The cadets of the N.S.W. Western District
wanted last week to go to Bathurst to shoot for a
prize shield. The Defence Department refused
to pay their fares on the ground that it wasn’t
its business to spend public money in that
way. Then the Tory press of Sydney took a joint
and several fit, and denounced the Australian
Government for its meanness, and said things
would have been different if the cadets had been
under State control. 'Now the question arises:
If, as alleged, the N.S.W. State Government
would have given the N.S.W. cadets free
passes on the N.S.W. State railways if the
cadets had been under State control, why
didn’t it give them free passes even though
they are now under Federal management? The
cadets are the same, and the railways are the same,
and the blessed old State Government is the same.
The only change is in the substitution of Federal
for State control, and if that makes the State
Government so mad : and wild and mean as to
make all the difference, then it is a very mad,
wild, mean State Government.
Pakeha, from Ward’s Dominion :
One must naturally feel proud of the prosperity of his
ndtive land when, with a population of less than a mil-
lion, Maoriland can cheerfully offer the Ma Country a
couple of Dreadnoughts without taking a breath between.
When I heard of Joe’s offer my buzzom swelled. When I
glanced at the figures in the Maoriland Year Book it
swelled more. Our great financier, Joseph Ward, finds
himself in the unpleasant position of having to renew a
little p.n. for £3,133,238, which fell due on March 31, and
to a man who has to borrow £2,000,000 annually to keep
afloat, and some more for Dreadnoughts, this is a fairly
stiff contract. Another sample of his genius for govern-
ment is his determination that, with unemployment rife
throughout the Dominion, this is the ideal time to effect
the much-needed retrenchment in the civil service. He
announces that he will save a quarter of a million by
dismissing State servants. But the slump is not yet
severe enough to warrant any reduction in the Cabinet
allowance, though last year it spent £14,692. It is by
statute allowed £B9OO and 30s. per day expenses when it
is away from Wellington. It appears to have been away
from Wellington very often. Last year Joseph and his
crowd voted £20,000 for a superannuation fund, and the
Premier is now busy pushing the greybeard with the tall
plug-hat on to the' fund, while the greybeard with the
ordinary hat goes into the gutter. Ward’s first move in
the direction of retrenchment was the dismissal of 100
men from Addington railway workshops without a
moment’s notice; and, according to the manager of the
works, 75 per cent, of the dismissed are married men. It
is rather irritating to hear the cant about the “sound
business man,” thte *“ financial genius of the last
Administration,” in face of the fact that in
10 years the Public Debt per head has risen
from £6l 9s. to £7O 17s. 6d., and annual taxation
has grown from £3 13s. lid. per head to £5 os. 4d. When
the Affable One got back from the Colonial Conference he
told us he had a great surprise. It consisted of the news
that Mr. Edwaiid VII. wanted us to be called a Dominion.
Joe’s talk of Dreadnought-giving has not been received
with any enthusiasm, In Wellington, it is regarded as
something between a crime and a joke ; but rather more
criminal than humorous. In Christchurch, Tommy Taylor,
M.H.lt., is holding an anti-Dreadnougbt crusade, and
gaining strength every day. Other politicians, who have
stood off to watch which way the cat blows, are now
rushing to support Taylor ; and co-operation with an
Australian navy is now the popular cry. The most
pleasing event of late was that a huge meeting in Ward’s
own electorate overwhelmingly declared its total want of
confidence in the Government and all the Government’s
doings.

Discussing “In the Ranks” (29/4/’O9),
which migrated from Sydney Palace to M.L., via
Newcastle, on Wednesday, a Bulletin writer
observed that either the play had changed or he
had undergone an alteration since he first saw it
at London Adelphi, a matter of 15 years ago ; and
he went on to suggest that it had been modernised
and otherwise altered by the present producer.
Mr. Allan Hamilton assures us that this is not so.
The play was presented in Sydney as G. R. Sims
wrote it. The Bulletin hastens to record this
depressing truth, and to notify to all and sundry
that in this, as in other Allan Hamilton shows,
the public is handed the real dramatic goods
without any adulteration whatever.

“ Lucky Durham,” a posthumous work of
the late Wilson Barrett, was staged at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday night last. It is a melo-
drama, and a poor one at that. Coming after a
play of the calibre of “The Hypocrites,” its
technical and literary demerits stand out with
queer abruptness. Form, action, and the proba-
bilities go down with heavy thuds before Dur-
ham’s crying needs in the way of picturesque
situations. It is hard to credit that any successful
business man was ever so verbose as is the hero of
this drama. The brief time his temperament per-
mits him to spare between orations would result
inevitably in his fortune expanding as slowly as a
Dreadnought Fund. Admitting that for stage
purposes the colors require to be laid on with
a bold hand, it is nevertheless overdoing it to
represent even one who has made his pile, in
America as so imbued with the spirit of fantastic
romance as to deliver an address to the portraits
in a picture gallery. Yet Durham does it.
He would deliver an address at anything.
On the credit side, the play deals with a
problem of undying human interest ; it has
some tense moments, and—when Durham is not
speechifying at length—it goes with a craftsman-
like verve and “ snap.” “ Lucky Durham ”is an
interesting, and, in spots, skilfully-constructed
work, marred mainly by the fact that the author
was unable, when writing it, to shut out the allur-
ing vision of himself as its leading character ; and
so, after the fashion of most actors who write their
own parts, he was impelled to give himself far too
much work. He puts himself on to bowl, and
thereafter is unable to summon up resolution to
take himself off ; and the result is prejudicial to
the dramatic team as a whole.
As for the plot, Lord Mountfallon has,
in his hot youth, met, deceived and abandoned
Mrs. Durham. The curtain rises to discover
John Durham, offspring of the union, consorting
with the identical social set to which his father,
Lord Mountfallon, belongs. Tricksy fate ulti-
mately lands father and son in the same house-
party during Ascot week. Durham, despite a
meticulously honest character, has contrived
somehow to become a millionaire in America at
an early age. Meanwhile his worthless male
parent has gambled and revelled away the entire
Mountfallon patrimony. The state of affairs
sentimental at Ascot is that Durham is in love
with Miss Vallerton, the daughter of his wealthy
host; that Lord and Lady Mountfallon wish their
son Reggie to marry Miss Vallerton, and so save
the family fortunes ; and, incidentally, that Lady
Mountfallon, in her ignorance, wants Durham to
wed Margaret Steighton, her daughter and his half-
sister. Mountfallon, maddened at the attention
Durham is paying to Miss Vallerton, threatens to
proclaim the truth about his base birth. Durham
saves him the trouble. The situation is too
striking to be missed. Selecting a commanding
position in the garden, he cries aloud, “I am
Lord Mountfallon’s illegitimate son.” Miss
Vallerton testifies to the unusualness of thissortof
episode in Ascot week by swooning against an
adjacent wall. In the next act the inevitable
mortgage deeds make their appearance, and there-
after they pervade the play. The end is tame,
but soothing to the right-minded. Durham,
having taken over the whole of the mortgage on
Mountfallon Castle, fixes a day to enter into posses-
sion. The hour approaches, and the soon-to-be-
dispossessed owner is shown enduring well-merited
anguish. Durham arrives with his mother, and
—delicacy not being his strong suit —informs her
before Mountfallon that henceforth she is the
mistress of the pile, and that her betrayer is a
pauper and a mere cipher. But Mrs. Durham
possesses a heart of gold. She heaps coals of fire
on Mountfallon’s head, and prevails on her son to
hand back the property to his villainous sire in an
unencumbered state. And about here Miss
Vallerton projects herself with much enthusiasm
into Durham’s arms, and the curtain falls.
The acting is notably level and good
throughout. One of the Sunday papers re-
marked that “Mr. Beatty works like a Trojan.”
That expresses it nicely. He fairly toils. And
it is necessary that he should. The feat of carry-
ing off, with an air, John Durham’s lines, freighted
as they almost invariably are with a dead weight
of obviousness and platitude, calls for all that an
actor may possess of resolution and energy and
address. Almost at times this sound performer
causes us to forget the flagrant unreality of the
rdle he portrays. Not so much for the effects that
he achieves as for the banalities that he so skil-
fully avoids, Beatty’s performance in “Lucky
Durham” calls for warm commendation. John
W. Deverell (Reggie Steighton) provides a delight-
ful little sketch of a London youth-about-town.
The temptation in this sort of part is to over-
play for the edification of the groundling. The
Criterion Reggie is no bleating asylum-candidate,
but, for the most part, a perfectly likely young
man of his class and period. James Lindsay is
ideally suited in manner, temperament and ap-
pearance to portray Vallerton. Gaston Mervale’s
Lord Mountfallon is a finished study. Miss Emily
Fitzroy is excellent as Lady Mountfallon ; Miss
Harvey ( TT elen Vallerton) and Miss Deverell
(Margaret (Steighton) do well; and Miss Hilda
Meade makes a success of appearance as Mrs.
Durham. The mounting and staging are satis-
factory ; though why the Vallerton’s house at
Ascot (which town lies amid pine-clad downs, a
good eight miles from any stream) is represented
on what the S. M. Herald (10/5/’O9) calls “ a reach
of the River Thames ” passes the comprehension
of this scribe.

As this paper goes to press a one-act drama

The Bulletin will have no opportunity of dis
cussing him yet awhile. On Saturday Miss
Tittell Brune is to reappear on the abandoned
site of “An Englishman’s Home,” in “The Girl

predicted that she will observe “Hell !” to the
ecstatic joy, as heretofore, of a whole host of
worshippers from topmost gallery to bottom-most

Nothing has occurred to mar the prevail-
ing harmony at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. Jack is in
good health, so is Jill; their respective parents
are well, and the minor characters are taking their
usual quota of nourishment. Seats are booked
ahead for days. The only complaint that is
heard issues from the box-office man, whose strong
right arm grows tired, betimes, raking in the
shekels. Life in this favored playhouse may be
described as one Glad Sweet Song, into which no
jarring note or deadhead or other undesirable cir-
cumstance enters.
“Out on the Castlereagh,” ,Mr. J. Clar-
ence Lee’s four-act Australian comedy-drama,
will be repeated on Saturday afternoon next at
Sydney Palace. The Playgoers’ Dramatic Club
will produce the bantling.

It was not till Bengough was nearing the
end of his season that Sydney began to appreciate
him. Then it rose up and gave him excellent
houses. So the cartoonist resolved to extend his
stay for another week. He will finally fade away
after the 15th.
The canned hilarity of Harry Lauder is
still on tap at Sydney Lyceum, where his voice
can be heard nightly warbling“ She’s ma Daisy.”
In writer’s opinion, Mr. Lauder is an over-esti-
mated party, and the captain’s song from “Pina-
fore,” by the Sullivan quartette, is a much more
enjoyable number. Some of Spencer’s bellow-
scopes are objectionable from a matrimonial
point of view. Man is depicted as an individual
who usually leaves his wife when another woman
with a more artistic hat heaves in sight. This is
immoral teaching and should be shut down upon.

West’s Pictures have left the Sydney
Glaciarium, which will return to the business of
providing real ice skating. The Pictures will
open at the Palace this coming Saturday night,
when there will be an exhibition of Victor Sar-
dou’s drama cinematographique “La Tosca.”
This ought to be worth going to see, as it was
played for photo, purposes by artists of the
Comedie Francaise, who, whatever else they may
be, are certainly not slouches.

Fred Bluett has come back to Sydney
Tivoli to cheer up the patrons, but otherwise the
show continues to be Chung Ling Soo with
trimmings. The Sydney season of the placid
magician terminates about May 21, and the mis-
guided few who have not yet seen him produce
the lady from the meat-safe are hereby urged to
repair that omission. Grahame and Dent, the
Two Bells, Cull Pitt, Baby Watson, and some
others revolve round Chung, and assist the
programme to extend from eight to something
after 10.

Possibly the chronomegaphone, which has
been showing Harry Lauder by sound and sight
at Adelaide Town Hall, does less than full justice
to that much-boomed comedian. At any rate, if
it were the only evidence produced when he is
seeking an engagement, the last two noughts of
his alleged £lOOO a week would be in grave
danger. The Invasion pictures, while quite life-
like, suffer badly from a want of explanation
slides. The French film-fakir always rams home
his story with even utterly unnecessary explana-
tions — “The Faithful Dog brings the Lost
Child home to bis Sorrowing Parents,” and so on.
The English purveyors explain only in a pro-
gramme slip, which doesn’t get read till after-
wards, and thus the puzzled spectator sees herds
of fighting men rushing violently down a steep
place into the sea, without any definite idea of
who is which. In another part of the Town
Hall Weiss is playing billiards with Lindrum.
Walter Baker and Miss Ross have given
individual satisfaction at the Royal in a
very moderate melodrama; and Miss Mabel
Hardinge, who played a lady with a past, once
more strikes this writer as being personally a
young lady with a future. At the Exhibition,
Miss Martha Bruggernann, a Conservatorium star,
has farewelled amid enormous enthusiasm, and
the Kilties’ band is making thunderous music
(varied by national dances) in that roomy build-
ing. The Tivoli and the Empire and the
Olympia are always busy ; and now a big new
rock-floor skating rink helps to keep Adelaide
from being dull of evenings.

The Chapmaft- Alexander Evangelical Vau-
deville Company, now performing in Melbourne
halls and churches, is working its little mission on
approved circus lines. The huge posters on the
stations and'walls and hoardings do not show a
bare-backed female waltzing on a horse, nor the
shrill Alexander, with a purple nose and clown’s
habiliments, cutting a Christian caper; but they
are a blaze of insane headlines and large red appeals
to the sinner to “come to Jesus.” The troupe
has hired the largest motor-car in Melbourne, sur-
rounded it with a tremendous transparency adver-
tisement, and goes whooping through the city at
night, creating a fearsome pious disturbance and
clamoring in flaring letters to the public to roll
up, tumble up, or otherwise arrive. The estab-
lishments are crowded where Dr. J. Wilbur
Chapman is giving his quaint revival monologue,

and Chas. M. Alexander, the silvery tenor,
is singing Sanlcey hymns with comic varn-
ions and both are juggling the collection

he can keep three collections in the air at one and
he same moment.) These imported serio-comic
salvation specialists look like actors, and act like
actors. Each performance is elaborately stage-
managed, each performer has his specialty and his
Deculiar “business,” and the whole scheme is a
sort of negro-camp-meeting appeal to the hysteri-
cal interspersed with lilting songs, amusing turns,
and funny stories. Dr. J. Wilbur K. Chapman s
life-sized photographs are all over the shop. Chas.
M. Alexander’s shrewd, but otherwise trivial,
countenance is also conspicuous on the outward
wall, and the ordinary worldly pro. and the usua.l
theatrical show are under a cloud. The evangeli-
cal comedians may not clear Melbourne of sin,
but they relieve it of a good deal of money, the
love of which is the root ot all evil.

“The Man from Outback,” who is own
brother to the “ Squatter’s Daughter,” and first
cousin to all the noble heroes of Australian melo-
drama that ever were, has seemingly caught the
fancy of the Andersonian public at Melbourne
King’s. His other name on the bill is “Stock-
whip and Stirrup,” and those two national
emblems are embossed upon his character. He
presents all the appearance of having escaped
from a circus, 'bringing some of the educated live-
stock with him. In fact, he commands the con-
fidence of the audience from the moment of his
arrival at the Muster Camp at Penimbla Cattle
Station, and one feels that the plans of the
local cattle duffers are doomed to defeat as soon
as he states that the “ downing ” of duffers
is his special diversion. Four acts and
14 scenes are required for the fulfilment
of his perilous mission, but the issue is never m

doubt. The flourish of orchestra that preludes
Ins entrance is prophetically triumphant. Even
when he is bound with ropes and dragged into the
boundary hut to be burnt alive there is no blink-
ing the fact that he is much too beautiful to die.
In a London bellowdrama the same young man
would be chloroformed and laid out to be crushed
by a steam hammer, or a steam roller, or, per-
chance, a railway train, and in either case his best
girl would rescue him in the nick of time from a
horrid death ; but this is a real Australian ro-
mance, and’ his salvation is accomplished by his
dawg. Also his horse comes in handy. The
faithful Towzer scales the roof of the hut, descends
the chimney, and unties the rope knots with its
teeth, whilst the horse wanders on and waits for
his master to turn up. The two animals have
seemingly detected the fire from afar, and con-
sidering that the flames don’t happen, but are
merely painted on the back of the hut and illumi-
nated by a limelight man, the intelligence of
those opportune dumb creatures is the more re-
markable.

Apart from the picturesque heroism of
Roy Redgrave, who never confronts imminent
danger without languidly lighting his pipe, and
the sensational revelations of Bert Bailey, and
the occasional deeds of violence in the first three
acts, this new production is not very entertaining
to some people. The dialogue between the minor
horrid characters is nearly as dull as the scenes of
unmitigated comic relief. A thin plot is unduly
spun out and crudely padded. However, the
people who want somethingmore reasonable than
“The Man from Outback ” are in a tremendous
minority at the King’s, and the crowds who love
such bellowdrama, and naturally prefer an Aus-
tralian atmosphere of fiction to an English ditto,
are numerous enough to keep Ironbark Jim
rolling down a precipice every evening until
further notice.

Miss Tittell Brune’s last Sunday in Mel-
bourne is to-night (Thursday). When that very
versatile and exceedingly fortunate young actress
has said good-bye to Jacky, Davy, Lively and the
rest of them at Silver Creek, she will say good-bye
to the audience. It was in “ Sunday ” that she
met Melbourne for the first time, some five years
ago, at Her Majesty’s, and in “Sunday ” she is to
make her adieu. One sees the best of Miss Brune’s
comedy, and the worst of her forced sentimentality
in this faded play. She, for her part, is an im-
proved actress (though she has lost some of her
youthful attractiveness) since her earliest svvear
delighted the local ear. And Mrs. Brough is a
gain to the performance. Otherwise the company
has weakened considerably, and the end of the first
act is tame by comparison with what it used to be
when Mervale was the bad young man who made
unholy love to the rowdy angel of Silver Creek,
and Cuyler Hastings was the good young man
who shot him very dead. It says much for Miss
T. Brune’s popularity that “Sunday ’’has stood
so many revivals with a deteriorated cast.

“An Englishman’s Home” comes to Her
Majesty’s on Saturday, with the advantage of a
more prolonged series of advance notices than it
got in Sydney. Melbourne is apparently disposed
to think of Major Du Maurier’s play as an unin-
tended suggestion of what may happen to an
Australian’s home if he doesn’t prepare for the
unexpected to happen. Anyhow, the man in the
street has heard enough about the matter to know
that “the play that has roused the Hempire is
neither a farcical comedy nor a dramatised version
of “Ruleßritannia.”
At Melbourne Princess’s, a revival of
“ Sweet Nell of Old Drury ” is billed for Saturday.
The Nellie Stewart season has only a few more
nights to run—the advt. says—so in order that
they may run on lines of assured success, Sweet
Neil is going to shake her curls at a new King
Charles, and a new consignment of courtiers.

At Melbourne Royal the joyous career of
“The Girl Behind the Counter” will end to-
morrow (Friday) night, and seats for that tuneful
occasion are being booked with avidity. Between
the departure of the Clarke-Meynell-Gunn opera
co. for other boards, and the arrival of the Oscar
Asche co. from London, a short interval has to be
filledin. “ Struck Oil ” is going to fill it. “Struck
0il,” with Maggie Moore as Lizzie Stofel, was
such a periodical drama at the Royal in days of
yore that there was a story of a ship’s captain
who dropped into the house once a year for ten
years in succession and never struck anything
else. And when his tenth annual arrival at Mel-
bourne port had renewed his acquaintance with
the Stofels once again, he wanted to know whether
the management would ever produce another
piece. Of late years the revivals of the ancient
’Murkan drama have been infrequent. In fact
Melbourne has aged considerably since it last
heard Maggie Moore play her mouth organ to H.
R. Roberts, who is reappearing as the old John
Stofel, father of the above.

“ 0.K.” : What I most liked about
Shackleton’s lecture (at Melb. Town Hall) was its
unconscious way of deceiving one for a while as to
the greatness of the last act in this drama of
Polar Expedition. What time the lecturer was
showing how three men went forth to locate the
Magnetic Pole it seemed that their dreary job
must have been the most dangerous and thankless
part of the contract. One thought of Shackleton
as of a military commander-in-chief in a com-
paratively comfortable position, directing a small
body of troops to go to a given spot with little
chance of getting there, and less chance of return-
ing alive. When it appeared that they did get
there, and were afterwards duly picked up by the
Expedition ship, as per arrangement, the figure of
Shackleton loomed large in the background for
the first time. Then came the pictorial narrative
of the six men who trudged down south, with
Shackleton personally in the foreground. Each
picture was colder and more bleak than its pre-
decessor, until at last one saw the hungry six
standing by the Flag which marked their turning
point in a wilderness of snow. Without insisting
on the fact, the speaker made it clear that the ex-
plorers had reached the extreme limit of possi-
bility if they were to get back to their nearest
dep&t. They had no time to spare if they vvere
to return alive to the stored pony-meat, which,
by the way, was tainted when they got it. They
might, of course, have eaten one explorer so that
the other five might Get There, but apparently
this expedient was considered too drastic. There
was no word painting of the difficulties to be
overcome and the dangers to be averted ; no
pausing to expound dramatic situationsand compel
applause from the audience. But in their appeal
to one’s imagination the dramatic force of those
snowscapes on the screen was irresistible. They
ought, of course, to be the final illustrations of
Shackleton’s simple yarn ; but, as he is not yet a
practical showman, he supplements them with
some comic-relief pictures of penguins and things,
instead of sandwiching the comedy into the drama
and bringing down the curtain on its climax.

“ 0.K.,” from Melbourne :
It seems that the scheme of a Repertory Theatre—
whereof Miss Madge Mclntosh is the moving professional
spirit—will he practically managed in all respects by the
J. C. Williamson firm if 'the guarantors can raise £4ooo—
in Sydney and half in Melbourne. The firm will
undertake to form the Repertory Co. and all the inciden-
tals to production, supplying extra artists when occasion
requires, for as long as the money suffices to keep the
thing going on a bare payment of expenses. But £4OOO,
after all, isn’t much of a provision against a series of
financial failures—not enough to give the “ literarj 7 play
a fair chance of a slow and steady growth in public favor.
And the venture is pretty certain to be a persistent
failure if the amateur promoters of the guarantee fund
are to have any influence in the direction of affairs. Coin
will go like smoke if the risky experiment is run on the
most risky, instead of the least unsafe, lines as regards
the order of the repertory. To begin with the most “ad-
vanced ” of the comedies in view would be to court a repu-
tation for crankiness, and d n the innovation from the
start. The wishes of some of the guarantors are bound to
clash with the ideas of a Williamson management based on
treasury receipts. If the clamorers for rapid changes of
bill are to be listened to, the Repertory Theatre is doomed
to die young. In short, the scheme can live only on the
support of the people who will contribute nothing to its
foundation. The Repertory Theatre, if brought about,
will not supply a ready-made want, but will have to try
to create it. Browning is mentioned as one of the play-
wrights whose works are to be staged. Well, if the
literary banquet is opened with a course of Browning, all
the people who have merely looked in to sample the fare
will rush off to a musical-comedy to get a cure for indi-
gestion. On the other hand, a bit of Bernard Shaw might
tickle their fancy.

“ Mireille, a Story of Provence” was
ushered on to West’s cambric at Melbourne
Olympia last week. Like “The Arlesienne,
shown some time ago, it is a love tragedy, which
saves up all its pathos for a few final flickers of
well-rehearsed sudden death. The death throes
of the passionate maiden in the belfry of a cathe-
dral are well done. Other pictures that were
pictured on Saturday included “ Mahometans at
Home, ” depicting the solemn Mahometan cere-
monial of being alive ; “Winter Sports in Stock-
holm,” showing how winter can make men glad ;
and “The Liverpool Grand National of 1909,”
which moved every “sport” and punter in the
audience to applause. Just now, West’s is issuing
booklet programmes of the “Drink” drama,
which will point its moral at the ardent spiritual-
ist on Saturday next.

Numbered among Tait’s thrills at Mel-
bourne Glaciarium on Saturday was the topic
of “ Niagara in Winter,” the huge natural
pomp of which causes a little fatigue. In
fact, the succession of extravagant marvels
ip jce-forms and tumbling water is apt to
pall on the sight to such an extent that the view
of, say, a turnip or an umbrella is demanded as a
restorative. “ Pompeii, the City of the Dead,
was another candidate for approval on Saturday,
and looked so utterly dead that ordinary death
seems a form of vivacity in comparison. Other
new arrivals comprised “The Oasis of Zibene,,
“The Special License,” and “The Poor Mans
Daughter,” which last demonstrates how a poor
damsel’s rise to affluence is marred by the
hasty and unreasonable decease of her “popper,
who is a magnate in the rag and bone trade.

Last week’s remarks upon the programme

whirligig of time brings her back.

at Melbourne Town Hall. After which she will visit
Sydney and other capital cities of the Commonwealth,
with a round of Maoriland to follow'. J. and N. Tait, who
take the management of Amy Castles this journey, have
arranged a comprehensive tour of smaller towns for the
much advertised songstress. Thus far her notoriety, which
is now ten years old, has not been exploited in the country'
districts. There’s a lot of money waiting to be piled on
the altar of her Australian fame. In Victoria, at any
rate, a good many thousands of people believe that Amy
Castles is the most renowned singer under the sun, and
the Taits desire to give as many as possible of them a
chance to express their belief at the pay-box.
On several Saturday and holiday nights of late “ the
police ” have, niade an unexpected display of vigilance as
regards overcrow'ding and blocking of the gangways
at Melbourne Royal. Yet the Board of Health,
and the police and the ushers, and every intelligent
student of the. situation must know' that a hundred occu-
pants of standing room at the back of the dress-circle, for
instance, would do nothing to prevent the escape of
the audience that a theatre is licensed to hold. On the
contrary, they would probably help to clear the way for
the crowd by pushing open the escape doors and prompt-
ing the ushers to fasten back the doors of the main exit
before the panic had choked the corridor. To be stand-
ing at the back of the d.c. when a cry of “Fire!” rings
out is to feel that you are all right anyhow. The people
in the front row' of the gallery are the doomed victims
when a theatre>gets ablaze. The few w'ho are standing at
the back of the dress-circle—a space large enough
to accommodate five times as many standers as
ever get there—retire in double quick time, after
shouting “Keep your seats! Don’t be alarmed!” to
their ill "fated pursuers. There is, of course, one element
of danger in the “standing room only” section of the
audience, and that is the danger of some of them sitting
on the steps of the gangways. The reprehensible citizens
who squat themselves on their neighbors’ only avenues of
escape, and would cause the avenues to be blocked with
fallen bodies if a rush set in, are almost invariably women
—poor creatures who have sat so much during the day that
they haven’t strength to stand in the evening. The police
have a right to see that the management of every theatre
keeps its gangways cleared for action ; but this matter is
always attended to at Melbourne Royal without any
prompting from aggressive constables.
Little Miss Irene Dillon, the soubrettish Melbourne
o-irl who got her first professional engagement in the
“ Mother Goose ” panto., is off to America with letters of
Williamsonian introduction to New York and London
managers. At Vancouver she was offered a local engage-
a fair salary, it is said, but she decided to go
further and try her luck. There’s no lack of self-confi-
dence about Irene. Besides, she carries her mommer
with her, and mommer has the financial wherewithal for
a pleasure tour around ; so Irene can afford to consider
the work-and-wages question at her leisure.
The cutting of Jack Wren’s connection with the Mel-
bourne Theatre Royal management should effect a distinct
improvement in the tone of the audiences. Wren’s name
at the top of the advt. tended undoubtedly to disincline
many people of the respectable class from attending the
house, w'hilst It attracted a lot of the “ toughest sub-
jects in the citv. People booked their seats for the d.c.
or front stalls' in fear of the company they might en-
counter. During the few months when Wren was sole
lessee and ran the show on his own (renting the theatre
from the firm of which he w'as a member), the d.c. crowd
brought an atmosphere of pony and trotting meeting
with it. The impurity of the Turf was perceptible at
a glance, and the odor of Wren’s defunct tote could be
smelt with the naked nose. Such a collection of evil-
looking bloke and loud womankind was gathered at the
performances of “ The Lily of Killarney and other of
Wren’s musical pieces! Judging from their comments on
the old operas, they would have been more interested in
the artistic merits of a “cronk ” glove-fight. They
mostly expressed an audible opinion to the effect that
“ Jack Wren didn’t know much about this ’ere gime when
he took it on.” And they were quite right, notwithstanding
the awkw'ard air of managerial wisdom that the boss
assumed when he sat in a private box, supported by his
relatives. However, he seems to have learned enough
about, the “gime” to abandon all idea of‘ever becoming
one of its shining lights. The other week he dropped out of
the firm, and left Rupert Clarke, Meynell and Gunn to
carry on the business.
“Snell”: There was an attempt to make “Diana of
Dobson’s” an object of Labor sympathy at Eight Hours’
time in Melbourne ; but the appeal didn’t work. Diana
was a legitimate call for sympathy as the sweated em-
ployee of Dobson, but when she came into her little lot
of money, she blossomed instantly into a “hit of class”
and squandered her gilt in high living with terrible
swells. In the last act, Diana contracts to marry her
well-bred adorer, who is passing poor on £6OO a year, hut
it is assumed that both have learned to regard this as an
ample fortune by reason of a few weeks’ experience of the
gnawing need of mere bread and jam. The play ends
here, with the assumption that all is well with Diana.
But reformations based on empty stomachs do not sur-
vive on full ones, and the girl who did in her own pile in
a month’s flutter, although pressed with every reason for
frugality, will certainly do in that £6OO when the night
she fasted on the benches in the park becomes a mere
memory.
A subscription was lately being raised in London for
“The Great Maekney” of yore. He did nothing but
blacken his face and sing topical nigger songs, with catchy
refrains, to his own banjo accompaniment, but he
reigned as “ The Great Maekney ” for about 30 years, and
hung on to his old reputation long after his incisive
voice and his personal magnetism had weakened. He
finally retired from the British public gaze—with a large
fortune, it was said. The fortune, big or small, has
slipped through the fingers that twanged the ole banjo,
and Maekney, in his 85th year, is very hard up. The
appeal lately made on his behalf is precty sure to bring
money enough to keep him out of destitution, for London
has a long memory for stage celebrities. As a phrase-
maker, or populariser of a phrase, Maekney is immortal.
The burden of his most successful song was “ We’re all
bound to go the whole hog or none”; and the world,
seemingly, has listed the minstrel’s doctrine among its
golden rules. To “go the whole hog” is a modern dic-
tionary expression. [A later report alleges that Maekney
has departed for the Golden Shore.]
One is reminded again that Miss Ola Humphrey, the
nice-voiced actress at present occupying an unreasonably
obscure position in “An Englishman’s Home,” is
privately a litterateur of some eminence. She composes
stories for an American paper, and a Melbourne journal
prints alfull-page photo, of the lady in the throes of com-
position. She is seated, expensive penholder in hand,
before a neat litter of cream note, apparently sterile of
literature ; as she is robed in a thunderous kimono, illus-
trated by a mob of tormented dragons or other imagina-
tive live stock, it would almost appear that the picture is
a snapshot of an unsuspecting sitter. But appearances
are so deceptive. Even the lady’s appearance of “throes
of composition ” may he deceptive.
“ Sweet Nell of Old Drury ” was brought to mind at
Singleton (N.S.W.) a week or two ag-o, when a carrier was
charged under the statute of Charles 11. with doing un-
lawful work on Sunday, viz., carrying a traveller’s samples
from the railway station to a hotel. He was fined ss. or
two hours in the stocks. The magistrate advised him to
pay the fine, as it would take some time to prepare the
stocks. The fine was paid, which was a very foolish pro-
ceeding. It is 100 chances to one that there wasn’t a per-
son in Singleton who knew how to make stocks. More-
over, the Act didn’t authorise the Law to keep the
prisoner in custody while the stocks were constructed.
It assumed that the stocks were always on hand. Any
attempt to detain the defendant while a carpenter was
building stocks would have been unlawful imprisonment,
and it would have been possible to recover damages.
“10-2-4”: In one respect alone are the probabilities
strained in “After the Opera,” the Sydney Royal
curtain-raiser. I refer to the attitude of the police who
discover Follett dropping from Deva’s first floor window
late at night. They are inexorable till he tells them that
“there is a woman in it.” Then they briskly shut up
their notebooks, apologise, and instruct him to pass
on. French policemen would probably have done
that; not so British ones. Under French law miscon-
duct of the sort Follett had been up to is
punishable by arrest and imprisonment. For divorce
purposes the guilty pair need to be caught “ en flagrant
dilit." The odious job of catching breakers of marriage
vows devolves on the police, and they hate it. They have
to he driven to this duty at the sharp end of the disci-
plinary axe, so to speak, and wherever possible they see
nothing and know' nothing. The view of the average
Briton is that his divorce laws aren’t rigid enough. He
has a strong leaven of Puritanism in his make-up w'hich
causes him to be obsessed with a lingering feeling—no
matter how gay his own life may be —that all other
offenders deserve the stake, or worse. In the eyes of
a British law-officer the fact that a man caught
dropping from another’s front window had pleaded,
by way of justification, that he had been carrying on with
the window-owner’s wife, would have aggravated the
situation rather than smoothed things over. It is a
1000 to 1 that the excuse would impel the policeman to
run his catch in (even if he believed his story) as a kind
of moral lesson. The unlikely conduct of the British
police is about the only sign of its French origin that I
can discern in this cleverly Anglicised play.
“0.K.”: One night lately a detachment of Mel-
bourne Trades Hall luminaries visited Her Majesty’s to
consider the matter of sweated labor, at Dobson’s, and
hear the interesting dialogue between Diana and her
onetime employer, Jahez Grindlay. The Trades Hall
men had seats in the reserved stalls. Further hack, in
the plain, ordinary stalls, sat ex-Premier Deakin with his
wife and daughter. Deakin seemed very much tickled
by the frank commercial utterances of Grindlay, whereas
the Labor representatives mostly missed the satire.
There’s everything of the draper, but very little of the
insufferable snob about Grindlay. He candidly rejoices
in the fact that he bought his baronetcy, reckoning it a
profitable business advt. “at the price.” He’s a bit of a
wag. When he said, “Those whom the King delights to
honor, you know, his Majesty’s loyal subjects delight to
patronise,” the smile on Deakin’s face was particularly
affable. Probably he was thinking that the fat and fer-
vent loyalists in Australia would be less wearisome if
they took an unclouded Grindlay view' of titular “ dis-
tinction,” and didn’t try to “kid” themselves that a
self-made man is the noblest work of God.
“ Hamer” : An English paper comments upon the sad-
ness of seeing Ellen Terry playing subordinate parts, and
takes it for granted that it is the loss of her money that
compels her to remain on the boards. Probably it is the
loss of her money that keeps Ellen Terry on the boards
in subordinate parts, but that doesn’t say that she
would leave the stage if she were affluent. People sel-
dom leave the stage voluntarily, and it’s often difficult to
drag them off. If Ellen Terry still had her money, she
W'ould probably continue to be leading lady at her own
expense. That would be sad both for the public and for
the memory of her past performances ; and it w ould cer-
tainly not give her much happiness to realise that she
had become a failure and an out-of-date. There are lots
of sadder things than the sight of Ellen Terry playing
subordinate parts. • , »
“Vulcan" : Ballarat veteran Robson, who adjudicated
at the recent Commonwealth Eisteddfod, was an active
first-believer in the vocal possibilities of Mrs. Melba. He
and others in the days ’way back organised the first
concert to raise money for Nellie Mitchell’s deportation,
and raked in a dazzling £O7. That, of itself; was sufficient
to take a life-rest on, but he’s been busy looking for
another Melba ever since, and is still optimistic.
Some interesting facts were disclosed in
the hearing of an abortive action brought by a
Perth (W.A.) bill discounter against the local
R.C. bishop, on three promissory notes for £220
in all, drawn by a priest who is now dead, and
endorsed with the forged signature of the de-
fendant. The bishop’s private secretary, giving
evidence to support the allegation that the
deceased priest was a forger, stated that he saw
him sign the bishop’s name to a cheque (duly paid
by the bank) which was drawn on account of the
business ,of the Morning Herald, a Perth
newspaper. The priest in question was
the managing director, and his bishop the
chief shareholder, in the journal, now defunct.
A bishop as the controller of a newspaper issued
under the common worldly name of Morning
Herald, is a disquieting revelation, anyhow.
When a weekly publication frankly proclaims
itself an organ of sectarian opinion, it is no sort
of fraud upon the few outsiders who may read it.
It doesn’t profess to discuss public affairs or re-
port passing events from any but a particular
church point of view. Put a daily paper that
calls itself the Morning Herald, and is run by a
bishop and priests, practically sails under false
colors, and invites sectarian War in journalism.
Had the R.C. Bishop of Perth’s blessed organ
played upon public credulity with sufficient clever-
ness to obtain a wide circulation, it must surely
have led to the appearance of a Daily World, or
what not, under L.O.L. domination. In which
case, doubtless, the police news of the rival rags
would have been startlingly contrasted, the case
of John Brown or Patrick Murphy appearing very
large or very small according to sectarian circurc*
stances.
THE ACTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Just as the busy world prepares to play,
After long hours of work for living w'age —
Muffled against the cold, in waning light,
The Actor leaves his home at close of day ;
Now' it is time for him to take the stage
And help to pass the weary hours of night.
The dark grey hour that severs day from night
Finds him, at ease, preparing for the play,
With paint and powder, symbols of the stage.
Thus, nightly, in strange garb he earns his wage ;
Oft working in the sunshine of the day,
To fashion pieces played in whiter light.
Ready to act, he steps into the light,
Bows to. applause that greets him ev’r.v night—
(How small the favor shown to him in day !)
So onw’ard, to the finish of the play,
The Heroine and he, the Hero, W'age
War against countless odds at ev’ry stage !
And so behold ! The wooden garish stage
Takes on the softer glow of day-time’s light,
And we, who watch the strife the puppets wage,
Forget the world outside is plunged in night.
Lost in the sweeter sunshine of the play,
Until the curtain falls, for us ’tis day.
But cometh to an end the longest day,
Although it only be upon the stage.
The curtain drops and finishes the play,
The stage is but a stage, no scene, no light—
Once more the Actor steps into the night,
Nearer, by one whole day, his w’eekly wage.

In response to many inquiries induced by
“Moorabinda’s” par re the curative virtues of
dugongoil and lard, The Bulletin has ascertained
that these articles can be obtained from any re-
putable chemist. If the chemist should not happen
to have the goods in stock he can always secure a
supply by return of mail from his wholesale house.
Extract of dugong is vended in the following
forms : dugong oil, emulsion of dugong oil (con-
taining 50 per cent, of the oil reinforced with
various aiding chemicals), dugong lard, dugong
ointment, and dugong rheumatic cure. If any
local chemist declines to obtain these for any pur-
chaser, this office will give the name of a firm
that will supply through the post. Probably the
reason why dugong oil is not so well known as cod
liver oil is because it - is a purely Australian
product. The prices range from Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d.
for the various sizes.
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY.
Policeman : “ Don’t you know you musn’t skate

Boy (after several falls): “ Who’s skating ?”
A Sydney daily paper advt. that should
romp home an easy winner for the Complete
Candor Stakes:—

x Lady, means, view mat. Dreadnought, G.P.O.
He has no means and no prospects, and dreads
nought that is female provided she has means.
And he doesn’t even, after the usual fashion of
his kind, describe himself as a gent!
“ Fifczwilliam ” : The daily papergram has
frequently remarked last week that “the Ar-
menians are still being massacred.” For some 20
years, to my own knowledge, this statement has
appeared in the newspapers at least twice a week
and sometimes oftener. I kept no records prior
to that date, but my grandmother—who is dead
now, poor thing—told me that it had been just th 6
same as long as she could remember—say for
about 60 years. So it is evidently the normal con-
dition of affairs. In addition, whenever things
are dull on the “ Bourse ” (don’t know where that
is), or there is a slump in Russian Jews, or Kaiser
Bill sends a telegram, or doesn’t send a telegram,
time-and-a-half men are put on, and we have
“Armenian atrocities,” which, I apprehend, are
a superior class of massacre. Just now, in spite
of the fact that the Turks are otherwise engaged,
we read of some particularly atrocious massacres.
Now, what I want to know is, how ever does the
supply of Armenians keep up with the demand ?
I have never been to Armenia, and so long as
God gives me strength, have no intention of
going; but on the map it is quite a small place.
So, unless Armenians are imported from other
centres, it is evident that the industry would
have died from sheer inanition many years ago.
The obvious remedy is, of course, to put a pro-
hibitive duty on Armenians, and the Sultan can
make what use he likes of this statement. My
knowledge of Armenia made some money for me
once. A seedy-looking man in black clothes
called at my office and announced that he was an
Armenian Christian, and asked for a donation to
his church. I was so affected by his story that I
gave him sixpence. Then a horrid doubt assailed
me. There was nothing about him to show that
he really was an Armenian. So I whistled to
him, and he came back, and I asked him had he
ever been massacred. He smiled in a sickly
fashion and said “No,” and I was so indignant at
being imposed upon that I felled him at one blow,
and demanded my money back. In the excite-
ment of the moment he gave me 2s. 6d. It was a
very simple test, of course, but it would not have
occurred to anyone who did not know a lot about
the history of Armenia.

The “Old Soldier” discusses foreign
affairs:—
“ Trotters ” (B. 22/4/09) seems alarmed at the idea that
Germany “Is determined to possess Holland,” etc. There
is good reason for the German idea that the Rhine is a
German river, since 400 miles of its course is through
German territory. It would be surprising if Germans did
not try hard to secure interests in Antwerp and Rotter-
dam, which are really the ports through which the whole
oversea trade Of the rich mining and manufacturing pro-
vinces of Westphalia, Elsass, and all south-west Germany
must pass. As to “ the chances of a struggle between
France and Germany for Belgium and Holland,” the two
countries have been fighting this issue at short intervals
for 300 years and more. It began when the Hollanders
struck for their independence, and went on all through
the Thirty Years’ War, and the wars of Louis XIV. and
the first French Empire, and only came to an end with
the French collapse in ’7l. Holland is for all practical
purposes German now 7 , in race and language. Its experi-
ence of British alliances in the past has not been
encouraging. The Queen of Holland is married, by the
advice of her Ministers, to a German, and her
daughter will be brought up as a German, and any out-
side pressure will almost certainly force the country to
join the German Confederation, which can pro-
tect it against any Continental Power.- What could
Britain and France do? It is very doubtful whether
Britain, in spite of Haldane’s boastings, could embark two
complete army corps, or 60,000 men, in a month
after the order u’as given to get them ready.
Long before that the Belgian army, which is not to be
despised for its size, would be in motion to hold the fron-
tier against the French, and there would be six or eight
German army-corps between Luxemburg and Belfort
with their cavalry W'ell across the frontier, and their
heavy siege guns being hurried up by railway to crush
the forts between Nancy and Epinal. That would give
the French something to think about. What would be-
come of the British expedition in such circumstances is
hard to say. The German staff has an idea that it would
land in Jutland, and has made elaborate arrangements to
keep it there till it'can be manoeuvred into a corner and
forced to capitulate. “Trotters” has rather a curious
idea about an alliance, or something of the sort, betw'een
“ the United States, Japan, China, Britain and France ”
to prevent Germany getting hold of the Netherlands East
Indies. How long wrnuld such an alliance last, and what
would the people of the United States say to it? It is a
question whether a white man’s country is really very
much the better for having great populations of niggers
subject to it. What has Britain gained by having the
East and West Indies and South Africa? Nothing but
W'ars which have given its armies a training of doubtful
value, w'ith a great waste of possibly useful lives.

The other day Yic. railroad expert Tait
learned, with .amazement, that the Adelaide ex-
press had been delayed 100 minutes through the
stationmaster (the sole official) at a small Western
District place called Armstrong falling asleep.
This overworked employee has, it would seem, to
be more or less on duty the whole 24 hours, and
has to sleep at the station with an alarm clock at
his ear. The first thing that might strike an
ordinary Commissioner in such a case would be to
so arrange matters as to give the wretched em-
ployee a little sleeping time of his own. But Tait
is an extraordinary Commissioner —quite extra-
ordinary. What he did was to ukase that “in
future heavy sleepers are to be debarred from
responsible positions on stations.” If he will but
keep at it, Tait may presently produce the ideal
railway employee—one who won’t need to sleep,
eat or drink, who will make one suit of clothes
last a generation, will get through his work in the
open air, and perform 50 different jobs at once
with his hands while he rings the bell with his
feet.

An Age report of a burglary in a Mel-
bourne Jewish household concludes with an asser-
tion that the housebreakers “helped themselves
freely at the larder, and demolished the better
part of a ham.” Perhaps the good, non-porkful
Hebrews kept the ham lest any Christian burglars
should drop in. There are no Hebrew burglars.
A WISE RULE.
He : “ You were very proud last night in town,
you wouldn’t recognise me. I saw you twice.”
She : “ Oh! Then that accounts for it. I never
recognise people in that condition.”
“I.” : To term the Law an ass is to cast a
serious reflection on a comparatively sensible four-
footed animal. In proof, what self-respecting,
long-eared beast of burden would ever dream of
wording a charge like this ?
That accused, together with divers other evil-disposed
persons to the number of 500 and more, on the fourth of
January, 1909, at Broken Hill, being then armed with
sticks, stones, and other offensive weapons, unlawfully,
riotously, and routously did assemble together to disturb
the peace of our Lord the King, and, being so assembled,
gathered together, and armed as aforesaid, did then and
there unlawfully, riotously, and routously make a great
noise, riot, and disturbance, and did then and there
remain and continue assembled as aforesaid, making
such noise, riot and disturbance for a considerable time
to the great disturbance and terror not only of the liege
subjects of our said Lord the King there being and re-
siding, but of all other liege subjects of our Lord the
King then passing and re-passing in and along the King’s
common highways therein contemptuous to our said
Lord the King, &c.
And what the Law meant to say was simply that
T. Mann had whooped things up at Broken Hill
and raised a dust.
THE BORROWED SHIP.
Mr. Dacey, speaking at Botany, said : “ The Dread-
nought that some people propose to give ought to have
three balls on its flag.”
Adelaide has opened two more electric
tram-routes —making five so far. Scarcity of cars
is the chief difficulty. The local output is only
two a week, and the new lines use them all up for
ordinary traffic. The football season has already
brought some ugly crushes. The present car will
hold 70 people at the very most, and a procession
of even ten of them makes little difference when
10,000 people want to get away from an “ oval ”
at the same moment. It is proposed to build a
few bigger cars by the time the “semi-final”
crowds assemble.
“Croson”: This
Turkish uproar in-
terests me, but I
have few hopes
from it. The Turk
is still the same
old Turk he was
when he first slop-
ped over into
Europe. His un-
clean mosque shave
altered no whit
these many cen-
turies; his bridge
over the Golden
Horn from Stam-
boul bazaars to
Galata is the same
dilapidated wood-
en contraption it
ever was ; and he
still toils up the
stepped streets
from Galata to
Pera though he
thoughtfully pro-
vides ponies for
visitors to ride, the
while he boots per-
spiringly behind.
But the thing that
impressed me as
most typical when
I last saw him was
his method of
watering liisdusty,
dog-pestered
streets. It was
August, and hot.
One brownish in-
dividual led a pony
up the titamboul
hill from the whar'
towards St. So-
phia ; .behind the
four-legged beast
was a cart wheron
was lashed a bar-
rel ; at the rear of
the barrel was a rubber hose with a rose at the
end ; and behind the rose walked another brown-
ish human holding a string and swinging the rose
from side to side. He distributed the water im-
partially over the street, the mongrels, and him-
self. It was all so futile, and sq hopeless, and so
Ottoman.

The Melbourne G.P.0., in refuting a
charge of mislaying valuable correspondence,
lately uncovered the operations of a juvenile
Rothschild. The institution had been accused by
a well-known city firm, in the usual magnificent,
off-hand manner, of losing heaps of correspond-
ence; and in order to clear its character it set a
regiment of detectives on to the spoor of the pro-
perty. Whether by instinct or by a highly-
trained sense of smell the trackers were not long
in finding their way to the lair of the firm’s office-
boy. There they rescued the absent literature,
which had got stranded through lack of the neces-
sary postage. It seems that the youth had rifled
the wealth that had been adhering to the en-
velopes, and, with care and frugality, was laying
the foundations of quite a large fortune. He also
laid the foundations of quite a large hiding—and
probably got it.

“Hamer”: The temperance person pays
a tribute to the allurements of alcohol in
the names he gives his drinks. He is
probably not responsible for the christening
of “ginger beer,” “ orange champagne,” and
such things, but his own special concoctions
he dubs “ wines,” “ales,” and similar attrac-
tive names. One of the fraternity recently
induced me to partake of what he called
a “milk whisk.” I fancied that it might
be a milk punch or a “ tiger’s milk’’--which
is a sort of fortissimo milk punch ; but it
turned out to be an ordinary milk shake.
By using “ whisk ” instead of “ shake,” the
best part of the name was dragged in. But
I paid this temperance enthusiast with his
own coin. By specious arguments 1 in-
duced him to go into a bar with me, and
I advised him to try cherry brandy. To
one used to the hollow mockery of temper-
ance nomenclature, the “cherry” was an
evidence of mildness, and my temperance
friend, who, in spite of his assumed know-

afterwards.
If Melbourne’s Board of Shirks is skimpy
in the quantity of Yan Yean it supplies to citi-
zens it is at least generous in the matter of
quality. For his yearly payments the householder
gets not only water, but mud, worms, fish, and an
eel or two, and the other day a thrifty housewife,
drawing a dipperful to flavor the family soup, was
overjoyed when a lively black snake, over a foot
long, ejected itself from the tap. Some interfer-
ing person sent the snake to the Board. The
Board merely yawned and said it wouldn’t charge
the lady anything extra for the reptile; also it
advised her never to put her mouth to the tap
when she felt thirsty. Furthermore, it remarked
that there were several reliable filters on the
market, and it would be happy to supply one at
50 per cent, increase on cost price. The lady
hasn’t replied as yet.
A “ROYAL” WAGE.
THE JAP CONSUL
At the usual fortnightly meeting of the Windsor Board
of Guardians the relieving officer reported that the wife
of one of the employees on the Royal farm at Windsor had
had to be sent to the asylum. The husband had offered
to pay 2s. per week towards her maintenance.
A Guardian : “ What are his wages ? ”
The Relieving Officer: “Seventeen shillings and six-
pence per week.”
Mr. Mitchell: “ Does that include a freecottage ? ”
The Relieving Officer: “No; he has to pay 4s. 3d. a
week rent, and he has a family to keep.”
Mr. Mitchell: “Then I think they ought to be paid
better wages. English nexus item.
Seventeen shillings and sixpence a week !
Blessed indeed are the humble and meek !
“They shall inherit the earth?” That is true:
They get the earthiest labors to do—
Tending of cattle and shearing of sheep,
Ploughing and harrowing, sowing, to reap
Tares for the workers and crops for a clique—
Seventeen shillings and sixpence a week !
Seventeen shillings and sixpence a week !
Try to imagine it! Vainly I seek
Words that may paint to these happier climes
What this dole means through England’s hard times.
Is it a matter for any surprise
That the “ bold peasantry ” sickens and dies ?
That it is painfully anxious to flit,
Seventeen shillings and sixpence to quit?
Seventeen shillings and sixpence a week !
“ Royal ” employment I shall not bespeak
While plain Democracy offers to me
More than twice that, as a minimum fee.
Grant me this boon, I beseech you, O Fate—
Let me walk wide of the Windsor Estate !
Let me continue these waters to haunt!
Seventeen shillings and sixpence, avaunt!

The Truth Must Stand.
You know the proverb, “A lie has no
legs ” —it cannot stand when put to the test.
If the public try an article advertised to
possess certain merits and the advertised
merits are found to have “ not a leg to stand
upon,” that article cannot gain in the public
favour. Sunlight Soap has steadily gained
in the public favour from the date of its
-'ntroduction, and long ago it attained, and
: t continues to maintain, its pre-eminent
position amongst Soaps of having the largest
sale in the world.
VERTIGO.
Habits play havoc with the body. Food habits,
drink habits, worry habits. They affect our flesh
and bone, and cause no end of trouble. The
stomach weakened with excess of food, the liver
clogged with accumulated bile, the brain poorly
nourished with impure, stagnant blood—the
result is vertigo. Remove the cause, cleanse the
stomach, help the liver, clear the brain. The in-
fallible remedy for your trouble, FRANZ JOSEF
Natural Aperient Water, if taken daily before
breakfast, in small, pleasant doses, will repair the
damage. It will clear vour liver, give you a clear
head, and drive away the dizziness forever.

The vaporous mystery as to who wijl
undertake the opening of Will Dyson’s picture
show has resolved itself into the solid form of Mr.
George Reid. The representative Funny Man of
politics—who is obviously the right person to in-
troduce the- attraction of Will Dyson’s wicked
caricatures of Senators and sich —has promised to
df> the deed on Tuesday, 25th, at 3 o’clock. That
will be the day before the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment re-opens, and members of the two Houses will
doubtless attend the function in force. Furlong’s
Room in the Royal Arcade is the chosen
rendezvous. Meanwhile the artist has to deliver
his lecture on black-and-white drawing in general
and caricature in particular. The discourse
comes due on the night of the 13th, the date when
the present issue of The Bulletin is published.
HIS TROUBLE.
Mother : “ What’s the matter now, Tommy l
Fighting again, or have you lost the shilling
I just gave you l ”
Tommy: “ I’ m financially embarrassed!"
Mother: “ What do you mean?”
Tommy: “I-I sw-swallowed the shilling?”
What hairsplitters these churchmen be !
At South Melbourne the Anglican community is
rent like a bit of wet blotting-paper over the
question whether the sacramental wine should or
should not contain any alcoholic properties. It
wrestled with the matter at great length, and
finally allowed the fermented article at matins,
but restricted the morning worshippers (who
start at 11 a.m.) to the unfermented wet goods.
Presumably there will now be a hefty rush to
matins, although that service entails the discom-
fort of early rising. Somebody, writing on this
difficult subject, remarked that it didn’t really
matter, as the average communicant didn’t take
enough to wet a fly’s feet. That man hadn’t
attended many communions. When this writer,
in his early Maoriland days, used to infest the drink
section of divine service, lie was horrified at the
awful gulps that some of the communicants
took at the cup; and one cold, grey morn-
ing this led to a disreputable scene. A deep-
drinking but pious Canterbury squatter, who
had ridden some miles to attend the service,
had found the air rather keen ; and being in a
hurry to get away to his breakfast he placed him-
self at the extreme left of the chancel, where the
curate usually started. The curate handed him
the goblet with the remark: “Drink this cup.”
And he DID. The butt-end of it rose steadily
higher and higher till it was within 10 degrees of
the zenith. Then the curate grabbed at the vessel
and tore it from the communicant’s hands, spill-
ing what the squatter had not drunk over his
riding trousers. Then he filled it up again, and
passing it to the second worshipper, kept his
hand on the stem all the time. He had only one
bottle of wine, and the first man had made a large
hole in it.
London is fonder of its criminal associa-
tions than Sydney is. Having had to alter the
whole locality in which the gallows at Tyburn
used to stand, the London County Council is busy
perpetuating the memory of the old choking
machine. Even an old stone inscribed “Half a
mile from Tyburn Gate ” is being preserved,' and
let into the front of a local bank. As for the
hallowed spot itself, the exact location of the man-
and-woman-slaughter-factory has been determined
“as the result of considerable research,” and the
place has been marked by a stone with a fancy
picture of the gallows itself inset in brass, and the
proud legend “ Here stood Tyburn Tree, removed
1759,” in great brass letters set in granolithic.
There is something quite Chinese in this reverence
for the death-bed (so to speak) of one’s ancestors.

The devices of the opium-smuggling China-
man are various. Sometimes they are vain;
sometimes they are not vain. One searcher
noticed a slight scratch on a lamp-bracket in
the saloon of the Prinz Waldemar, lying at
Sydney Circular Quay. He looked closer, and
found a cupboard built into the saloon wall, the
door of which was the lamp-bracket. The cavity
or orifice or plain old hole was full of opium. In
Melbourne, a passenger was detected owning a
trunk with a double bottom. The staples in the
trunk were really screws, which enabled the false
bottom to be removed, and the inward space was
crammed with the drug. In a different category
was the experience of a Sydney officer of Customs
who noticed a bland Chow carrying a watering-can
along the deck, in full view of everyone. The
officer casually glanced at the can as the son of the
Central Flowery Land trotted past. He wasn’t
surprised—the Customs men are past being sur-
prised at anything. The can contained £3OO
worth of opium. And a careful search hadn’t dis-
closed a tin on board the ship.

“N.” : One Rugby, of Tasmania, writes
at great length to the Argus re the lost continent
of Atlantis. He scouts the assertion
of the London Times that Plato’s
Atlantis meant Crete. An Egyptian
priest of Sais told Solon that beyond
the Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar)
there was the sunken island or con-
tinent of Atlantis, about 2000 miles
ong by 1000 broad. Soundings prove
the existence of that great plateau.
Indeed the cables might have been
hardly possible without it. The pla-
teau is covered with volcanic debris.
The lack of indentations on the coasts
of France, Spain and Morocco prove
that there was a breakwater, and At-
lantis was the breakwater. Traditions
of Atlantis abound among the people
of those coasts, and also abounded on
the American coast. Most important
of all are the discoveries made in
Yucatan, Mexico. A high civilisation
existed there 11,500 years ago. It
was derived from Atlantis. The pre-
sumption is that Atlantis was sub-
merged by a volcanic convulsion 9000
years ago. The Atlanteans were great
navigators. They dealt and fought
with the Cretans, etc. They had a
magnificent temple of Neptune. Bacon’s
New Atlantis is in the Australian direc-
tion. Altogether a mighty subject.
Long ago the N.S.W. Education
Department should have taken the step
it is now taking to put down the scan-
dalous imposition of presentations to
inspectors presentations of plate
sometimes, of money other times,
and, on one or two occasions, of silk
hats and mounted walking-sticks. An
inspector who was leaving the service had his
presentation, as a matter of course ; but in recent
years inspectors who were merely shifting from
one district to another expected the silver plate,
or purse, or at the very least the hat, stick or
travelling bag. Teachers who would have liked
to serve the “bloke” with one on the napper
handed out a sovereign and looked pleasant the
while, lest word should be passed round, and that
teacher should become a marked pedagogue and a
thing of loathing to all inspectors. The heads of
the Department now announce that they have
closed down on the flagrant imposition.
“ Trotter ” writes :
Mrs. Zebina Lane hands me, through her London pub-
lisher, a little book descriptive of her railroad trip through
Siberia, only a few months ago. It confirms what I have
written in these pages more than once, that Russia will
become too. strong for Japan in Manchuria. The Inter-
national. Sleeping Car Express leaves Vladivostock once a
week. The Government train goes three times a week.
Berths for the express are booked even three months
ahead. Being at Hongkong early in May, Mrs. Lane
found she could not get one of these berths till the end
of July. She decided to take the Government train from
Vladivostock, and declares that it is just as good as the
other, I never read anything more profoundly suggestive
than the account of her summer trip through Siberia.
She says it was a thing of unmingled delight, like a
beautiful dream ! The little book is crammed, as one
may say, with compressed thought. Such a revelation
of the growing greatness of Siberia, with its entrancing
natural phenomena in mountains, rivers, forests and
flowers. Most vivid sketches, also, of the population.
“ Adelaide It has been remarked before
that one of the chief delights a South Australian
experiences when r,eading The Bulletin is to find
unexpectedly that Sydney or Melbourne does not
possess some valuable thing which Adelaide has
liad for years, and never dreamt that a civilised
community could not have—female suffrage,
a progressive land-tax, an absentee-tax, a public
trustee, cheap law, and so on. Even in small
things Adelaide leads, it seems. I add to the col-
lection this week (B. 22/4/’O9), a comic suggestion
that boys should “ follow the horses” in the hope
of keeping the streets cleaner ; and last week an
agonised wail for numbers on motor-cars, so that
"ASK MY BROTHER AM I A LIAR ?”
In connection with the reports recently received by the Minister for Defence re the presence of Japanese
spies in Northern Queensland, that ponderously funny paper, the S. M. Herald, solemnly asked the Jap
Consul for his opinion, and, on the sole strength of that official's denial, the Herald declared the whole affair
to be utterly absurd.
GRANNY : “ And I may rely on you immediately ringing me up should Japanese spies
arrive here l ”
THE JAP CONSUL : “ Oh, certainly, madam."
the corpse could identify the road-hog who slew
him. Well, both these things—registered and
numbered motors, and street orderly bins, with a
small army of dustpan and broom attendants —
have been matters of course in Adelaide for years.
You may add the totalisator, trial of young
criminals in a separate court, cheap fruit, a fish
supply not in the hands of Dagoes, penny tram
fares, and—oh, send over a Royal Commission to
pick up points from quiet little Adelaide 1

The widening of Oxford-street, Sydney’s
patent death trap, has been at last decided on,
and the work will, it is expected, be commenced
this year. So far as actual labor is concerned, the
job only consists in the pulling down of an in-
toxicated collection of hovels and humpies which
straggles along the edges of the thoroughfare. The
real difficulty lies in the enormous values which
the landlords place, not on the actual tenements
—many of them are beneath the contempt of the
white ant —but on the land underneath them. The
prices demanded run into hundreds of thousands
of pounds. If the owners had paid rates and
land-tax on the stupendous figures they demand,
the case would not be so bad, but they haven’t.
Therefore, the proceeding is powerful evidence in
favor of a system whereby every owner shall value
his own land for taxation purposes, and the
Federal and State Governments, and the muni-
cipality will have power to acquire it compulsorily
at the owner s valuation without any 10 per cent,
added for “ disturbance.” Every man should put
the “ disturbance” money on to his valuation ; if
everybody did so, the only result would be that
the valuation would be a little higher, and the rate a
little lower, and things would be equal. Another
aspect of the Oxford-street case is that it furnishes
a powerful argument in favor of a Greater Sydney
municipality. Paddington, Woollahra, Waverley,
Bondi, Randwick, and Coogee will all gain
through Oxford-street being changed from a crack
into a street; yet, because these places are separate
municipalities, they will pay nothing towards the
improvement. And that sort of arrangement is
an ass.
The new Protection of Children Act in
England absolutely prohibits smoking by boys
under 14. It came into force on April 1, and
pretty well every policeman in the country was
neatly sold by some kid with a lighted match and a
chocolate cigar. Also the Act prevents any woman
from entering a bar with a child ; and already a
new calling is springing up—that of the “minder,”
who will hold baby on the pavement while mother
gets her gin. Also the law forbids the leaving of
any child under seven in a room with an un-
guarded fire; and an enormous trade in high
fenders is the result. But, unfortunately, it
does not prohibit the deadly flannelette.
“Dagonet” Siti:s has collected the published
incineration-cases for the first 12 weeks of this year,
and among children under 14 only, the records
shows 417 deaths from burning in the United King-
dom alone. Flannelette was definitely stated as
the cause in 95 oases, and suspected in most
of the others.

“ Melb.” : A jubilee report, just issued by
St. Mary’s Anglican Church, Melbourne, digs up
old recollections. The present Dean Vance, as a
spirited young cleric, started this church in 1853,
with a £5O subscription from Throckmorton, the
lighterman. Throckmorton went near to being the
ideal of Jerrold’s “Man Made of Money,” who
only had to peel a banknote off his chest. A Mel-
bourner of that era uttered the unique saying,
“I’m sick of making money.” There were
400 ships in Hobson’s Bay, urging to get rid
of cargo, and rotting their bottoms out.
No railway from Sandridge till the next year.
Men like Throckmorton, Grave, the sailmaker,
and Wilson, of the Argus, were all but stifled
with cash. When Vance had wheedled his £5O
out of Throckmorton, and gathered npsome more,
he went to the celebrated George Francis Train,
then a merchant in Flinders-street near the Eliza-
beth-street corner, and bought a zinc building for
a church. Throckmorton’s was a big brick build-
ing next to Cole’s Wharf. No trace whatever
remains. Mrs. Throckmorton was the most dash-
ing leader of Melbourne society before Mrs. Mai-
leson. She was annoyed by a horribly bitter
article called “The Poodles,” written by Geoige
Paton Smith -in the Age, and reflecting upon the
gentlemen of her coterie. The celebrity of this
article was a press tradition for many years. The
word “poodle” came into vogue, but has gone
out. Not exactly “dude” or “Johnny,” but
something akin.
THE OPTIMIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. G. H. Reid has accepted the position of patron of
the newly-formed Optimists’ Club of New South Wales.—
News item.
Yell “ Hip hooray.” Dry all the tears ;
Squirt paeans from the concertiner ,
Shout everybody lengthy beers ;
Adopt a debonair demeanor ;
Although you find another boy
Your Sunday girl has been and kissed,
Just laugh and dance and sing for joy
With Reid, the Optimist.
Weep not at Foreign-trade’s defeat;
Nor heed the Dry Dog’s protests squeally ;
He yet may learn to swim, and beat
All records held by Cecil Healy.
Laugh loud as frequent grow the gaps
Upon the fading Tory list;
Some day again you’ll triumph—p’raps—
’Neath Reid, the Optimist.
No hurt the Optimist can sting,
For, in the end, all things he says ’ll
Come right. He’ll simply dance and sing
When trustees all his cash embezzle.
Such folk but laugh if men they meet,
Their noses should most rudely twist.
They never know when they are beat,
Like Reid, the Optimist.
And now there is a chance that they
Will cease from loud, in terror, shrieking
When pompous politicians say
That revolution, red and reeking,
Will come if Fisher’s party hold
The reins of office in their fist—
We yet may gather in our fold
G. Reid, the Optimist.
No more he’ll say “ Hear, hear," when Smith
(That’s Bruce) is howling of the Hatters ;
No more the Petriana myth
He’ll use ; but mention other matters.
In future, George will not insist
On fish that badly putrified is,
For now he is an Optimist,
And G. H. Reid upon our side is.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES.
“ Bob ” : “ Wang” (B. 1/4/ 03) is wrong
in stating that “ in agricultural districts plough-
ing matches find much favor.” Time was when
furrow-turning contests were held yearly in every
farming district. But that was when the plough-
man walked along between the stilts of a single-
furrow implement hauled by two horses. Nowa-
days, except along the coastline, multi-furrow
ploughs are used, and one man steers the imple-
ment by screws and levers, and not by handles,
as of old. He also has to tend the four, five or
six horses required to draw the sod-turner.
Ploughing matches are now as scarce as reaping-
hooks, and only two districts in Victoria hold
regular annual events. “Wang” is mostly
wrong again when he writes that “the
cocky in whose field they are held shakes
hands with himself. A good ploughing match
saves him pounds.” Ploughing match committees
usually select the most even-surfaced paddock
procurable. Then the champions and beginners
proceed to transform it into a series of hills and
hollows that promise destruction to harvesting
machinery. Match ploughing may be pretty ; but
high crowns and deep finishes, which frequently
rCsemble drains, are not favored by practical
farmers. After the competition the level paddock
resembles a much-rooted and half-ploughed field,
with fancy trimmings here and there. It takes
some work to level it up to proper shape again ;
and by the time the job is finished the cocky isn’t
shaking hands with anybody.
“Hera,” from Maoriland : What’s this
about a cedar splinter (B. 25/3/’O9) ? Cedar is
cedar and kauri is kauri, but a splinter may serve
for a toothpick. When I left the bush last
Christmas I had to pass where the Kauri Timber
Co. was working the kauri in the Mangakahia
Valley. A toothpick lying in the creek-bed took
my fancy, to probe a hollow tooth I had. When
I rode up to it on my Maori weed I could just
look over the top of it. I measured it with my
axe handle. Fifteen feet long, 10ft. diameter,
meaning a paltry 30ft. in girth. I haven’t got a
book of logarithms handy, but it’s somewhere
near 18,000 superficial feet, worth where it lies
£77 10s. When it gets to the mill, which it will
before next summer, it will be handed out in
planks and such like building material in exchange
for a cheque for £l5O. If they made it into
window-sashes and doors, the cheque would help
quite a little to pay for our Dreadnought.
A DIFFERENT NIGGER.
“ Weren't you the man to whom I gave a meal,
and who stole my fowls'!”
“ No, mum, that was m’ twin hr over; he am the
black sheep of d’ family.”
“R.8.W.”: As to weird pub nomencla-
ture. In High-street, Golden Square (Bendigo),
is the "Dew-drop Inn.” Other quaintly-styled
Bendigo hostelries are the "Olive Branch,”
“Noah’s Ark,” “Durham Ox,” “Rock of
Cashel,” “Brian Boru,” and the “Five Tuns.”
In Benalla is to be found “The Five Alls,” illus-
trated by (1) parson (I pray for all); (2) soldier
(I fight for all); (3) lawyer (I plead for all) ; (4)
doctor (I cure all); (5) toiler (I work for all). At
East Loddon are the “Hit or Miss” and the
“ Shoot ’em Flying.” Near Mansfield, and at the
mouth of one of the finest trout streams in Vic-
toria, the “ Hunt Club” Hotel allures the passing
toper. The name suggests a design to pursue the
trout on horseback.
THE PRODIGAL FATHER.
Hard Working Elder Son (recognising derelict drifting out of the sunset): “Damn it,
here’s the old man turned up again. And I suppose he'll expect me to keep him till he
gets another job.”
“T.A.W.”: Referring to the controversy
anent the speed of bush-fires. During the par-
ticularly disastrous fires which occurred in the
Riverina district some four or five years ago, the
flames at times travelled at almost incredible
speed. The heat was terrific—the thermometer,
even in places far removed from the fire area,
touched 118°, and in one or two instances 119J°,
in the shade —and a raging westerly gale chased the
flames eastward like a tidal wave. Many times
the fire was observed to travel distances of one to
two hundred yards in a jump, and in one case it
leapt from one hillside to another, a distance of
almost a quarter of a mile, in a flash. Borambola
Station, up the river from
the township of Wagga
Wagga, was encircled by
four-chain firebreaks, which
the management thought
rendered the property quite
safe, but the flames simply
took the breaks in their
stride. The Murrumbidgee
river, also, offered not the
slightest bar to the progress
of the fire, which crossed it
backwards and forwards in
several places. The home-
stead at Book Book Station
was surrounded by a high
and thick green hedge,
which it was thought would
afford some hope of saving
the buildings, but the flames
licked up this defence in a
few seconds, and the home-
stead and out-buildings were
totally destroyed. The occu-
pants fled with the clothes
they wore and the station
books. In many cases
families were only able to
save their lives by taking
refuge up to their necks in
tanks and dams, and it was
out of the question in most
cases to attempt to rescue
more than a few articles of
clothing. One man indeed,
was unable to do even this
much ; the fire reached his
holding during the early
hours of the morning, whilst
he was still in bed, and
when it had passed over the
only worldly possession he
could boast of was his night-
shirt. A well-known resi-
dent of the district, Mr.
James Angel, had some
half-an-hour’s start on the
fire, and raced it on horse-
back from Lake Albert to
Humula, a distance of about 15 miles. He killed
a good horse in the performance, and only won by
a short head, and was then forced to join his
family in a near-by creek to save his life. Of
course, these cases are scarcely parallel with those
mentioned by “ Milky White ” and “ Dandalup,”
where the fires travelled through heavily-timbered
country, but they are interesting as showing the
speed at which bush-fires —or rather plain-fires—
can skurry along under favorable circumstances.

“ Silas Snell” : I have been studying the
bushy’s horse on Gippsland tracks, and wish to
place on record a discovery I have made. The
average bushy’s neddy on Gippsland back tracks
is a sociable brute who wants to make the acquaint-
ance of every stranger on the road. He will
always accommodate himself to your gait if he
overtakes you, and if coming in the opposite
direction he invariably stops on reaching you. If
you do not stop, too, and exchange compli-
ments and Conversation with the man on
top, the horse is visibly disconcerted, and
tries to get after you. Herein the Gippsland
prad simply reflects the habits and customs
of the natives. Old nags are so broken to the
trick of suspended animation on meeting friends
and strangers, and so convinced that everyone
wants to stop and talk about crops and climate,
that the ancient Gippsland prad is useless in a
dense population. A sawyer from Gembrook
tried to ride such a horse along Swanston-street,
Melbourne, the other day, and after his mount
had conversed with three policemen, introduced
himself to a pieman and a dentist’s commission-
aire, and frightened a woman into hysterics by
trying to whisper in her ear, the teetotal eques-
trian was arrested for l>eing unduly intoxicated
when in command of a turbulent steed.

“ Gip ” : Ants have their troubles like the
rest of us. I amused myself oh a sunny morning,
not long ago, watching a few of them fighting
stubbornly with the unexplainable. Some very
light particles of fat, skimmed from “stock,” had
been thrown out in a shady spot. The ants found
and attacked them with enthusiasm. Taking a
largish piece in his nippers, one would start off
for home, gradually making his way on to the
warm garden path. As he progressed, his burden
grew lighter, till at last it dissolved into nothing-
ness. The astonishment of the ant was variously
expressed. Generally, with uplifted whiskers, he
asked distractedly of the atmosphere “ Whaffor?”
All the herd of ants stood stock still, and did a
puzzling think before returning to the fat and
starting the annoying performance all over again.
And when an ant had lost his bit, of fat three
times he generally charged his neighbor with
stealing it, and then ant-Sheol broke loose.

A sporting item : On April 30, 1810, the
first horserace in Australia was run. The course
was at Parramatta (N.S.W.), and the two
horses (only two) contesting were named
Parramatta and Belfast. The race was won
by Parramatta. The chronicles state that
the proceedings of the day were enlivened
by cock-fighting, wheelbarrow-racing and jump-
ing in sacks. A publican gave enough calico
to make a chemise for a prize “to be run for by
three vestals of the current order,” that is, cur-
rency lasses. The race caused great amusement.
There were but six publicans in Parramatta in
those days—James Larra, Andrew Nash, John
Piesley, Andrew Snowden, James Wright and
Mrs. Ward—and the five publicans and the one
publicaness did good business.

“ Tarcoola ” : I hereby award the Associ-
ated Liars’ belt, medal and clasp to John Pasmore
for his par (B. 8/4/’O9) re the Murray cockatoos
which learned to talk from an escaped captive
bird. No talking or whistling bird that returns
to the wild from civilisation is ever allowed to
live and contaminate its relatives with its garru-
lousness. When the latter first hear the returned
wanderer ask to be “scratched” or what not,
they fall off their resting places in sheer amaze-
ment, and then bolt like Judkins fleeing from
whisky. After putting some distance between
themselves and the freak (who meanwhile is
wondering if they have all gone daft) they hold a
council of war, and eventually return and tear
Mother’s Darling to pieces. To prove the truth
of this, just sit in a quiet corner of your garden
one day and watch Jack, the magpie, defend him-
self against his wild brother who persistently
endeavors to wipe out the incessant gabbler for
the honor of their joint kind.
THE CIRCUIT HORSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Billy Giller had a cottage in a little one-horse town,
Where there dwelt a missionary, well—we’ll call him Mr.
Brown.
He was working up the circuit, which was deep in debt
and sin.
Billy used to work at odd jobs for the butcher, Mick
O’Flynn.
Billy’s backyard and the parson’s were divided by a fence,
Old and broken were the palings, and of not much
consequence.
Through the gaps old Billy used to poke his head to get
a view
What his neighbor did and didn’t, what his neighbor
ought to do.
Billy had a horse and kept it rolling fat and shining clean,
But the parson’s horse was seedy, and the parson’s horse
was lean !
Many masters he had served with, men of manners rough
and strange,
And he thought when taking Orders there would come
a blessed change.
He could jump and he could gallop when his heart was
young and gay ;
He was old—but ’twasn’t age that made him hold his
head that way !
Though the years his limbs had stiffened, ’twas the lack
of oats and chaff
Made him look as sour and sorry as a little skim-milk
calf!
True, he had a pious master, one who never cursed or
swore,
Exercise and fresh air also ; yet he wanted something
more !
Slowly in the circuit buggy, sadly did he trot along
Out on visits, country tea-fights, sometimes “ Services of
Song,”
Tea-fights, at which brothers sat, and sisters smiled and
poured them tea;
Coffee-suppers, where the pastor and his flock fed
sumpt’ously ;
Then there came, when feasting finished, choice selec-
tions by the choir;
All the time the old horse hungered standing by the post
and wire 1
Billy Giller wasn’t honest, as the strictest notions go ;
He’d been “had” for cattle-duffing, and had done a year
or so !
But within him was no meanness; one thing touched
him to the heart,
’Twas his equine neighbor’s sufferings, and he strove to
take his part.
On a shining Sunday morning, when all Nature seemed
to laugh,
And the circuit horse was eating some apology for chaff,
Billy Giller stood and waited, knocking at the parson’s
door.
It w'as opened, and the pirson stood and smiled, and
nothing more.
Half-bewildered was the good man, but he thought he
guessed aright—
Doubtless, here, a soul in darkness sought assistance to
the light.
Rousing sermons he’d been preaching, must have
reached his neighbor’s ears,
And a conscience-stricken sinner was about to melt in
tears.
But no sign of tears showed Billy, he was mutt’ring,
wond’ring still
How to start without much swearing, and he hardly had
the skill ;
There he stood, and looked like thunder, never even said
“Good-day”—
Thinking, glaring, mutt’ring, fumbling fpr the proper
words to say.
“D'ye think that this’ere Jesus ” (out it came all in a
burst),
“ Who, ye say, wuz kind and friendly even to the ver3 r
worst—
D’ye think that this ’ere Jesus, if ’e ’ad a ’orse down here,
’E ’ud starve it, starve it, starve it, cuz a ton of chaff wuz
dear ? ”
Very red the parson’s face grew. Billy walked out to the
gate,
But, like other great reformers, he had spoken rather
late ;
For the horse’s days were numbered—glad to quit, he
bade adieu
To the church and to the circuit—’twas the best thing
he could do !
SHAW NEILSON
“ Peterkin’s ” tale :
Dave was as decent a cove as ever put lips to ’is pint,
and ’ad a good grip at eighteen bob a week and keep. 'E
might ’ave got over the odds p’r’aps two or three times a
week, but in between whiles ’e was as good as any
Christian, and a dashed sight better than most. But ’e
’ad one weakness. *E let ’isself be inflooenced by the
Bible-bangers, and they persuaded ’im to take on some
nameless drink-cure rubbish. As’s missus’s cow was near
calvin’, ’e thought ’e’d give the stuff a trial, sos to
make sure of bein’ ’andy when the thing ’appened.
So every night and mornin’ ’e used to go round to the
’ouse of one of them no-beer cranks and drink some of the
cure and ’ave somethink interjected into ’is arm with a
syringe. F’r about two weeks ’e never ’ad a drink, but
then as the calf ’ad arrove and looked ’ealthy, ’e thought
’e might as well come back to beer. Me and several other
gennelmen was in this bar the very evenin’ ’e came in.
We was all on pints, and it was a real pleasure to see Dave
as ’e smelt ’is, and weighed it, and ’eld it up against the
light. Then ’e swallowed ’arf of it and put down ’is mug.
I never saw a bloke’s face change like Dave’s did. ’E
says quickly, “ That’s rotten beer,” and goes ’astily to
the door. We all tasted ours, but they was all right, so I
drank the rest of Dave’s, and found it the same as ours.
’E came back presently, looking pretty miserable, and
’ad another go, but ’ed only got quarter through it when
the same thing ’appened again, so ’e went ’ome. F’r
about a month ’e tried ’ard to get back to ’is old self
again (’e was a fair cow to persevere), but it was no go.
You see, they’d put some stuff into ’is blood that made ’im
sick every time ’e tasted beer. No matter ’ow much ’e
tried to drink, it was all waste of good stuff.
Dave lost weight, and got a nasty look about the eye.
Stands to reason any sociable bloke like Dave would
miss ’is old cobbers, for it was rotten standin’ by and
seein’ others enjoyin’ ’emselves without bein’ able to take
a ’and ’imself, so ’e gave up tryin’, and used to waste ’is
time doin’ odd jobs at ’ome for ’is missus. I went to
see ’im once or twice, and ’e told me ’e wished
’e was dead. The days seemed twice as long to ’im as
they used to (it’s wonderful ’ow a beer or two makes time
fly), and ’e ’ankered after the clink of glasses and the
sight of the red and yellow labels on the bottles. Dave
’ad rather a pretty way of puttin’ things. It was ’orrible
to see a man driftin’ like that, so I advised ’im to try
salts to clear the poison out of ’is blood, but ’e said ’e’d
tried thaltand several other things besides.
The end came even more suddint than we expected.
Dave cut ’is throat, and the coroner said there was
nothink to indicate the state of ’is mind at the time.
Tint I understood. Poor old Dave 1

F. 0. Robinson. Proprietor
“Kondar” writes :
We have been 12 months on our lease in the Backblox,
where the call of the wild is still heard. Here, strange
forms flit or slither around o’ nights. The phalanger was
our first visitor from the bush.. We are sufficiently civil-
ised to possess a pantry, and have a fruit-dealer who calls
every fortnight. On nights when the back verandah
door stands open, Mr. Phalanger takes stock of our apple
supply. Failing apples, he favors the,sugar-bag. He has
also tested quinces, but they are not to his liking.
We are on friendly terms with wood-adders, bats,
lizards, gohannas (not too friendly with these gentry, they
like eggs too well), hornets and wasps. The wood-adder
chases moths about the ceiling at night, and amuses us,
when he makes a catch, by bashing it against the wall.
We often catch the bats to put them out of doors again.
T’other night we noticed two little spider-like insects on
the back of a big vampire specimen—bat vermin, no
doubt. During the heat-wave about New Year, the
waterbag was swarmed daily by thirsty hornets and wasps.
Many rare (to us, at any rate) specimens are noticed.
One is an immense brown moth with a white slash or
stripe right across from one wing-tip to the other.
Another is a dainty satin white moth, wings pink-edged,
the upper half of body a bright pink, with black dots like
buttons all along where pink top and white under part
meet. A big beetle measures lfin. in length and an inch
across, and its lovely colors are laid on in bars, bronze-
green and gold underneath, and a bronze maroon with
gold on the back. And there are many others. Wild
dogs, rabbits, hares, and game of the feathered variety
are all plentiful hereabouts, and of varying degrees of
unfriendliness.

Another imported pest smuggled itself into
Australia lately, when several logs from the
Malay Peninsula, on being sawn through, were
found to be bored in all directions by a small
beetle, since identified as one of the Bostrychidae,
similar to the Rhizopertha of the apple tree, and
hitherto unknown here. As the importer has
already passed some similarly bored timber into
use, and as it has been made up into furniture, it
looks as if another curse had got a permanent
foothold. And to have Bostrychidae about the
premises sounds awful.

“ A.H.A.” speaks :
A yarn yclept “The Referee” (8., 22/4/’O9), is here-
by disqualified for five reasons : (1) A water-tube boiler
won’t explode. You may burn a tube and cause a
small local escape of steam, but that is all. (2) The
safety-valve is automatic. If Old Nick himself was at
the wooden end of the shovel, about 10 percent, increase
over the normal pressure is all he could manage. (3) A
boiler pump is always on the move, the fireman only
regulates it. He doesn’t jerk in an hour’s supply in a
minute or two. (4) When the engine started “ racing,”
what was the matter with the steam stop-valve? (5) The
only approach to this tale is the case of an engineer who
found a vacuum in a boiler. He hauled it out and killed
it with a hammer before it could bite him. Perhaps the
proper explanation is that the narrative fell out of the
“ Abo ” column by some accident.
CONSOLING.
The Victim: “Good God, man, that's the wrong
tooth you've got hold of!"
The Dentist: “ Oh, well, now I’ve got hold of
him I’ll have to get him out. Then I’ll take
the other one out and only charge for one
extraction.’’
THE BEAUTY OF THE FALLING DUE.
Town Friend : “My word, I like this effect of the falling dew I”
Cocky : “By gum, that reminds me! I believe the mortgage is up to-morrer.” (Runs into
the house to examine his papers.)
“ Larrakeyah ” : The Bulletin prints
(11/2709) G. J. Bruce’s letter on a White Aus-
tralia, and remarks that “a vigorous correspon-
dent like this is a cheering person to meet.” Now
G. J. Bruce wrote in Batavia on January 21, and
by the very spirit of his letter it is plain that all
his knowledge was gained in the few hours during
which his boat stopped at Port Darwin, lie states
that P.D. is almost entirely in the hands of
Chinese, with a few Japanese, Malays, Indians
and other Asiatics to back them up, and a few
aborigines to do their little odd jobs. Such a re-
mark is absolutely untrue. It is a dashed Ananias
and a Gehazi. Of the four principal stores, three
are run entirely by white men. The three hotels
are run by whites. The two banks, the cable-
station, the railway, the post office, the butcheries
are all run by white men and in white interests.
It is doubtful if there are 300 Chinese in
P.D., but there are over 500 whites. G. J.
Bruce also calls attention to the fact of
the Government bonded stores being run
by Chinese coolies. Before his letter was
written the coolies had been sacked, and
the work is now done by white men. All
Government tenders have the clause,
“White labor, when possible, must be em-
ployed.” In the majority of cases nowa-
days, Chinese tenders are higher than
those of white men. As to it being a
matter of local notoriety that in Port
Darwin white Australians have to call
themselves Ah Smith, Ah Jones, etc.,
to get a living—well, it is a matter of local
notoriety that there are persons so called; but the
names are given in derision, because the said coves
(or blokes) are in favor of a piebald Australia.
Twenty years ago, the Chinese in Port Darwin
outnumbered the whites by six to one. Ten years
ago, they were three to one. To-day, the whites out-
number the Chinese by nearly two to one. Arid the
greatest increase is in white women and children,
whilst the greatest decrease is in Chinese women
and children. The figures for December 31, 1906,
were: White children, 275; Chinese children, 91;
white women, 170 ; Chinese women, 20. Someone
has been pulling G. J. Bruce’s leg, and it is a
marvel that the miserable old limb didn’t come
right off.

“ Janor ” : Re most pleasurable bush toil
(B. S/4/’O9). Like “ Huffin-Guffin,” I’ve had ago
at bark-stripping, but I can’t enthuse over it as
he does. It is hard on the hands, and produces a
chronic kink in the neck. Also it gives to the
grafter no glowing sense of achievement. For
ideal bush work give me the falling of trees. A
keen axe, a good forest, and Australian weather,
and a man can sail in and enjoy his job. Tree-
falling is not all manual work either. There is
only one direction to fall a tree in with a mini-
mum of chopping. Having determined that, and
the width of scarf required, you chop out the
belly scarf squarely facing the direction of fall, and
then the back scarf lets her go with a crash, and
the stately vegetable is yours. (By the way:
How is it that many bushmen use the word
“calf” instead of “scarf”?) I’ve taken on all
sorts of bush work, and for clean, healthy and
joyous toil I plump unhesitatingly for tearing the
whiskers off the earth’s countenance. For
pleasant is the ring of the blade, the flight of
chips and the aromatic air ; and a mighty satis-
faction is the prostrate giant.
“ Kola ” : It is a pity “ Cict ” (B. 22/4/’O9)
did not discover his little 3in. eel a bit sooner.
Then he would have found him climbing steadily
up his alleged 90ft. waterfall. The elvers that
come up the Hopkins and the Barwon (Vic.) have
to negotiate falls, and I have watched them at it.
It is marvellous the way they edge up, crawling
along ledges, and making little darts upward when
they get the chance. “Cict” has jumped at a
wrong conclusion when he talks about eels pairing
before they leave for the sea. They don’t; and
that blows out his second argument. If “Cict”
had been at Port Campbell (Vic. west coast) a few
weeks ago, he would have seen shoals of eels
fighting to get out of the river across a bar of sand
that blocked their exit to the sea. A gang of men
cut the bar through, and thousands of big eels
poured out into the ocean—to pair, spawn and
die. So “Cict” had better take a day off, and
spend the morning collecting some further novel-
ties. The afternoon he can devote to collecting
the £5 he owes me. I promised that fistful of
coin to anyone who procured me an eel with eggs
in her. Such a fish has never yet been caught (the
eels in the sea are at such a depth as to be un-
catchable); and “Cict” has now a chance both
for pelf and fame. If he doesn’t produce his
eeless with her eggs, I shall fine him the £5, as
aforesaid, with Costs.
THE LAW-BREAKER.
“Hullo, Jim! Been defy in' th' law? ”
“ Yes, called th' missus a bloomin’ liar."
The Federal Government has put its foot
down on a proposal to import stoats and weasels
from Britain to chew up the Australian rabbit—
also imported from Britain. Even in England
the stoat and the weasel are classed as vermin,
and the Lord only knows what' they would be-
come in the great wild spaces of Australia. Any-
how, the Fisher Ministry isn’t taking any chances,
and, having heard that the pastoralists proposed
introducing this addition to our imported pests, it
issued a proclamation prohibiting the arrival of
the animals.

Westerner: Your inaccuracy is painful. For
instance, you tell how “ Rason’s boss, A. E. Morgans,
grabbed the Premiership and gave Rason a port-
folio,” and on that you build a thrilling story of
how Rason, when Morgans went out, put up a sort of
record by crossing the floor and securing a portfolio
under the next Premier. It is an interesting story, but
there is no record that Rason was ever in Morgans’

A great diversity of
opinion exists among the

Melbourne has lost one of its notorious
“fighting” Orangemen in Rev. George Tregear,
who has gone West. Collecting girls was Tregear’s
hobby. Almost any sort of Flossie could get free
board and lodging at the Reverend George’s
expense by stating that she had escaped from the
washtub at a R.C. institution, and telling an
’arrowing tale of the machinations of Rome.
Tregear was horribly taken in by his collection of
girls, but no matter how many of them went back
to Flossiedom, the next applicant always had a
Protestant helping hand held out to her, and found
a hospitable, but bigoted, knife and fork awaiting
her.
The letter of “ Mac ” :
N.S.W. Premiers, since Federation and the practical
elimination of external responsibilities, have broken
down through overwork, or said so. John See, with a
farmer’s early training, the shoulders and arms of a
champion wrestler, the constitution of a locomotive, and
the business experience of a man of very large affairs, re-
signed the Premiership, after 38 months and 17 days.
Waddell, without facing Parliament, escaped leadership,
after two months and 14 days. Carruthers, just returned
with a majority, pleaded breakdown, after 37 months and
two days ; and now Wade, footballer and 50, reckons
he is ruining his health and his family prospects
by retaining office. But Wade has overworked himself in
the voluntary job of principal nuisance to the Common-
wealth. And Wade has only been 18 months Premier.
Parkes was Premier five times for an aggregate of 11
years, and then had to be chucked out. For 30 years he
strenuously led one side of the House or the other.
Martin, three times Premier, never wearied. Robertson,
five times Premier, headed Governments for nearly five
years and didn’t complain. Dibbs never pleaded exhaus-
tion, and, after five years, Reid was as fresh as a daisy.
Premier Wade may be seeking a refuge, and concocting an
excuse. In Chief Justice to his family, he may find it
necessary to take certain strong measures.
The divine Nellie Melba will be 44 years
old on May 19.
From “ Politicus ” :
The only member of the Victorian Labor party with
Ministerial experience is A. R. Outtrim, of Maryborough,
who was Minister for Mines and Forests in the Munro
Government; Minister for Mines, Forests and Defence in
the Shiels Government; andlater, Minister for Mines, Rail-
ways, and Water Supply for McLean. Outtrim is a native
of the Mile End-road, London, that Harry Rickards sings
about, and came to Australia as a youngster in 1852. Ho
has been many thing's by turns, and sometimes several
things at once, and nothing- long. At latest he de-
scribes himself as a mining investor, but he
has also been a pupil teacher, book-keeper, manager
for Cobb and Co., a wine merchant, an auctioneer,
a legal manager, an auditor, a commission agent,
and other matters and substances too numerous to
mention. He was elected to Parliament for Maryborough
in 1885, and has sat tight ever since. As Minister for
Mines Outtrim did much to develop the Korumburra
coalfields, and the little township of Outtrim is named
after him. When the Labor Party come into power in
Victoria the little man from Maryborough will be a safe
tip for the Mines Ministry, provided he is still on deck.
“ Mahoofc ” writes :
Re the discovery of the Coolgardie goldfield “ Dan-
dalup ” (B. 15/4/’O9) states the case misguidedly. Long
before Arthur Bayley 7 applied for the reward claim, he
and Ford were disfiguring and dry-blowing the face of the
gully that is now known in the Old Camp as Fly Flat.
They had all set out from Southern Cross (not per horse, as
stated by “ Dandalup,” but on camels), and as for
well, the only fodder along that arid roure is a vile variety
of saltbush that is disrelished by the heroic steed.
Bayley was in the habit of visiting the Cross at irregular
intervals to realise on the gold won, replenish the com-
missariat department, and arraign himself at the bar of
Beer. A boon companion of Bayley’s at the Cross was
the Windsor and Rainhill slaughterman, Deeming, who
was then engine-driving at Fraser’s Extended. Bayley
made no secret of the fact that he was on good gold,
but preserved a rigid silence as to his and Ford’s
whereabouts. Several futile efforts were made by
prospecting parties to locate them. It was said at one
time in the Cross that the outcrop of quartz which
marked Bayley’s Reward was found by a party which had
followed, but missed, Bayley’s tracks ; that Ford was
attracted to the spot by the noise of the knapping and
dollying of stone ; and that, on returning, he acquainted
Bayley, who straightway rode to Southern Cross and
applied for the Reward area. Bayley 7 married in Perth,
and came across to Victoria, where he purchased the
Avenel sheep station, in the north-east. There he passed
out about eight y 7 ears ago.
One of the few good results of Bent’s
Closer Settlement Act is the Inebriate Retreat at
Lara (Vic.). When George Fairbairn, of the
Vic. squattocracy, sold his Lara estate to the
Bent Settlement Board, the Bent Government
was advised to take over the homestead and 040
acres thereabouts for Retreat purposes. It is a
luxurious establishment, and the cases that go
there for “cure” are able to “knock off the
drink ” under most consoling conditions. Premier
Murray paid a visit of inspection to George
Fairbairn’s old home last week, in company with
the Vic. Inspector-General of the Insane, and the
Premier’s feeling remarks in reply to an address
of welcome were probably unprecedented utter-
ances from a man in his political position. He
told the retreaters that “he knew from personal
experience what the curse and degradation of
drink were ; but he knew also that a man could
rise above them.” And he “ hoped they would
look back to this institution with the same feel-
ings which he entertained towards a similar
institution.” There have been other Australian
politicians who might have qualified themselves
to serve as encouraging examples at a temperance
meeting, but Murray is the only one who, by
force of character and force of circumstances, has
attained the peculiar eminence of a Premier
among emancipated slavey of the bottle.
MISTER HOLMAN, OF N.S.W. STATE
LEGISLATURE.
Country correspondents of Sydney news-
papers have discovered a new field of information.
“ Mr. John Smith, who was junior railway porter
at Slapup Gully, has been transferred to a similar
position at Chinaman’s Flat.” Excepting the
names, the above appeared in the telegraphic
news of one of Sydney’s “ great dailies ” a few
days back.
HOW IT IS
DONE.
At the Labor demonstra-
tion in the Olympic Grounds,
at Botany on Saturday, Mr. T.
Brown, M.P., towards the’close of a
spirited address, became a little carried
away. He was urging: that, in spite of Labor’s
victories, it should relax no effort. “ You must not
rest in a fool’s paradise,” he said, “ but keep your powder
dry, put your shoulder strongly to the wheel, and make every
post a winning one.” J
Premier Price is still in a very precarious
state of health, and his colleagues fear that he will
not be well enough to meet Parliament in July.
So long as he lives the influence of his name will
keep the Labor party true to the Labor-Liberal
Cabinet. Should his illness prove fatal, however,
the remaining days of the combination will be few.
Tom Power, wisest, brightest and kindest
of Australian sporting scribes, has for years been
carrying welter weight-for-age—or whatever it is—
somewhere concealed in one of his organs. This
was excavated a week or so ago, and Tom, who is
recruiting in a Sydney private hospital, will be
twice the man for twice the time when he comes
out shortly and unloads his honest brogue on the
rejoicing air.
The death is announced of Mrs. Berry,
the second wife of the late Graham Berry, who
was many things in Victoria in his day and
generation—-Treasurer (six times), Chief Secre-
tary (four times), Premier (thrice). Minister for
Trade and Customs, Speaker, Agent-General, and
all the time good patriot. Berry came to Victoria
in 1852, and entered into business in Prahran.
Pie commenced life in politics as an “ agitator,”
and frequently told his wife, a very small and tidy
woman, that she should go to Government House
‘‘someday”; but the little woman died before
Berry achieved political greatness. In 1869 he
married the second Mrs. Berry, now deceased.
She was the daughter of Mr. John B. Evans, of
Geelong, Victoria.
Frank Hann, the Westralian explorer, has
made a ripple on the surface of events of late.
He was attacked by certain (or uncertain) niggers
out in the wilds, and his cheery remarks to the
effect that, if he could have got within range of
the dodgy aboriginals, he would gladly have shot
them and brought back their heads as trophies,
were regarded in church and bun-fight circles as
shocking observations. But Hann isn’t really
the wild man of the woods that some
people imagine, though his stories are thrilling
at times, and when he gets fairly started
even that other famous explorer, Oarr-Boyd,
bows his hoary head in shame. Westralia’s ex-
plorers are a queer job lot, but Hann is perhaps
the best; of them. He is a game battler and a
genuine path-finder, which is more than can be
said for some of the bar-room loafers who draw
the W- stern State’s money as mining pioneers.
Hann receives £250 per year from the Mines De-
partment, and is given a string of camels and a
roving commission to look for gold. F. S. Brook-
man, lecturing to the London Anthropological
Institute, showed some lantern slides of native
skulls, and was asked to forward one to the In-
stitute as an exhibit. Brockman passed the re-
quest on to Hann, who obtained the skull of a
long-deceased nigger; and this was sent on to the
London Institute some months back. Now,
partly through this event, an impression has
arisen that Hann is a professional head-hunter of
the deepest dye.
A letter from the West :
Back to civilisation, after eight years in Marble Bar and
other remote Westralian nor’-west places. Dr. W. J.
Durack. The doctor graduated at Sydney University,
and went across to the Great Sandy State, where the
Duracks are big men in the cattle business. The young
man was appointed medical officer in charge of the
Government hospital, and soon found his feet. His dis-
trict embraced the whole of the Pilbarra goldfields, some-
what larger in area than the State of Victoria, and when
a mail was too damaged to be carried to the hospital the
doctor had to be taken to him. Some time ago a couple
of mates went out shooting kangaroos, turkeys, bunyips,
bogeys or jim-jams. A double-barrelled gun went off
unexpectedly and blew about ten separate pieces off one
of the shooters. The much-battered sportsman was
taken to an adjacent camp, and a messenger set off
to apprise the doctor at Marble Bar, 175 miles dis-
tant. Without a moment’s hesitation, young Durack
started off, and although it was the height of summer, he
got over the sparsely-watered track in record time. The
man was found alive, but not much more. After patching
his patient up temporarily, the doctor hoisted him into
the crap and got him safely into Marble Bar, where he
eventually recovered. The Duracks are an old pastoral
family in N. S. Wales, and were the first to overland
cattle to the Kimberley district. They were nearly 2J
years on the road with the first mob, and as a result the
Argyle, Ord River, Denham, and other stations were
taken up and stocked. One of the ancestors of the family
was a Marshal of France, but the name was then Du Rnc.
They have done a lot of pioneering in Westralia. Two of
them were murdered by blacks in the Kimberley district,
whilst a third narrowly escaped a similar fate. He rode 70
miles without a break, and returned with a police party
to bury the dead. Dr. Durack is now revisiting Sydney
before resuming graft in the Nor’-West.
The editor of Sydney Telegraph had a
narrow escape last week. It seems that Germany
has dark designs on Holland. If the Dutch
Succession fails, Holland will disintegrate. If it
does that, Germany will seize, the Netherlands.
Then Britain will go to war with Germany, and
the Germans will swoop down on Australia, and
then, through the destruction of Sydney,' the
King-street editor will lose his job for a certainty.
All this horrible chain of events has been frustrated
by the birth of an heiress to the throne of the
country where Miss Hook came from, and the
editor breathes again. Still, when one remembers
the number of childish ailments that even queens
are heir to, to say nothing of the chance that the
Kaiser may drop a brick on her head at any time,
the position may break out again before anybody
has time to know where he are.

It is time we began to think about greater matters. I
urge that Australians should learn to think, not from a

Australian point of view.— Bruce Smith (261h1'09).
Oh be jubilant, Australia—rise and make a joyful bleat,
e6 fe C . rOSS autumn landscape upon large abundant
For the days of dz'ead are over and our victory’s com-
plete—
Yea, doubt is dead and gone ;
We have won a mighty battle—sound the trumpet, beat
the drum,
have knocked the Anti-Sosbers into Kingdom-blanky-
Come.
Let the land arise and maffick, let us cymbalise and
strum—
Bruce Smith is marching on !
He has joined Australia’s Army—yea, abandoned Anti-
Sosh,
Flinders-lane has lost its statesman representative of
splosh ;
He has jumped upon his credo, till it now resembles
squash—
Cobden’s faith he leaps upon ;
Wherefore cheer—yea, burst the welkin with your
thunders of applause ;
Lo, the shiny-hatted Tory calls for larger views, because
They will help to snatch Australia from Perdition’s
gaping jaws—
Bruce Smith is marching on !
They were dark, the days behind us when we fought the
bitter fight,
When we toiled for our great country—when we strove
to keep it white—
Little then we thought of seeing such a soul-uplifting
sight °
As we argued pro and con. ;
But the Foeman hath surrendered—he hath spoken loud
and clear,
He hath shouted his repentance in Australia’s startled
ear; ■
Wherefore spread the blessed tidings ’round the staggered
hemisphere,
Bruce Smith is marching on !
He has turned his back on shoddy—on Ram Chunder and
the Chow,
He has learned to think Australian ! Things will rush
and clatter now
Since this leader super-human agitates the fiscal plough—•
Yea, the long, long fight is won ;
Let the Nation lift an anthem that will rend the stars
apart—
Sing! Confound you, sing like demons from the cellar
of your heart;
See, the way lies plain before us—he has found the
missing chart—
Bruce Smith is marching on !
Nevermore our faith shall falter as we plod unto our goal,
He has healed us of our troubles—we are resolute and
whole ;
Chant a dirge for Fat, the fallen. Toll like all Jebannum,
toll!
Yea, Fat is spent and done ;
Tremble, Wade ! Thine hour is fleeting. Insects all,
your doom is near—
We have raised at last a champion—see our Moses, stern,
austere ;
Thro’ the wilderness of Hansard he shall lead us year by
year—
Bruce Smith is marching on !
So be jubilant, ye peoples, bound with swift and frequent
feet,
For our foemen let us dig the grave and sew the winding
sheet
For the hoof of Revolution—hear it rushing in the street,
As in ages old and lone.
The Tory’s tower is fallen, and his trumpet and his drum
Are silent as the kingdoms that have gone to Kingdom
Come,
But a clarion voice is telling of a new millennium,
And Smith is marching on.

The WILD CAT COLUMN
The revenue returns for April are to hand, and,
on examination, they pan out this way
State Revenues for April.
April, 1908. April, 1909.
N. S. Wales.. £1,179,588 £1,156,529 Dec. £23,059
Victoria .. 660,019 696,937 Inc. 36,918
Queensland.. 476,908 487,431 Inc 10 523
Westralia .. 280,273 270,267 Dec. lo’ooe
Tasmania .. 72,231 89,817 Inc. 17,586
There are three credit and two debit balances, and, set
one against the other, they show the five Sisters who are
awake (Sou’stralia wakes only once a quarter) to be
£31,962 better off than they were this time last year.
Although the cake, as usual, has been unevenly divided,
the family should be a little happier than it was 12
months ago, for on that dreary occasion Westralia owned
the only surplus, and the thing was only worth £305.
But the year’s figures, so far as they are available, do not
compare favorably with the corresponding slab of this
continent’s financial past life :
State Revenues for Year so far.
1907-8. 1908-9.
£ £ £
77. S. Wales (10 months) 11,839,990 11,308,325 Dec. 531 665
Victoria (10 months) 6,972,514 6,810,213 Dec. 162 301
Queensland (10months) 3,759,920 3,882,758 Inc. 122’838
Westralia (10 months) 2,771,486 2,613,973 Dec. 157,513
Tasmania (10 months) 829,688 782,732 Dec. 46 956
S. Australia ( 9 months) 2,705,789 2,577,351 Dec. 125’,438
Last year, all six States showed increases over the ’O6-7
period, the total improvement amounting to £1,808,987
This year, the only State of the half-dozen whose ledger
isn’t a horror is Queensland ; and Bananaland’s credit
balance this time is only £122,838, whereas last year it
added up £290,628. Between them, the other five States
have gone down hill to the extent of £1,026,873. (On
account of S.A. only waking up once a quarter, only the
religious State’s nine-months’ figures are included. The
family may now be represented as grouped round
Sou’stralia anxiously waiting to know if she at least has
some small change left over.) By simple addition, we
find that the difference between being £1,808,987 to the
good, and £1,026,873 to the bad, is £2,835,860. From
that, plane off Queensland’s one thin shaving of £122,538
and the coffin lid is level at £2,713,022. And that’s a
simple sum that should cause everv good Australian to
grieve a little.
Regarding expenditure, the only States for
which the figures are available are N.S. YV., Queensland,
and S.A. There is no cheerfulness in the revelations so
far as Queensland and Ma are concerned. (Sou’stralia’s
figures for 1907-8 went to sleep on the road)
Expenditure for Year so far.

N. S. Wales (10 months) 10,478,452 11,227,119 Inc. 74S 667
Queensland (10 months) 2,951,497 3,389,217 Inc. 437,720
S. Australia (9 months) 2,284,377
That represents added gloom to the extent of £1,186,387
for two States alone. And, on the whole, it’ is
just as well that the other Sisters are not anxious
to tell the amount of their bills; it kinder softens
the blow. It is worth noting how the people of
financial “Reform” in N.S.W. have continued their
immense loan drunk. For the first ten months of 1906-7
the loan expenditure was £1,082,608; for the first ten
months of 1907-8, it. was “Reformed” until it reached
£1,764,255 ; and now it has been further “Reformed” up
to £2,493,BlB—which is an advance of £729,029 on last
year’s blot, and £1,411,210 more insolvent than the 1906-7
term.
In this small matter, it is worth while to con-
sider the position of N.S.W. separately, and assemble its
figures in one lot in order to form some idea of where the
Wade-VVaddell combination is drifting to. Here is the
condensed argument:—
Financial Position of New South Wales.

Extent to which things have gone to the Dogs £1,151,923
Add increased Loan expenditure .. .. 729 029
Complete extent to which things have gone
to the Devil £1,880,952
If the two remaining months of the year run on the same
lines as the previous ten, this will be the final result on
June 30: —
Ordinary Expenditure .. £14,828,543
Deficit 1,258,553
Loan Expenditure .. .. 2,992,582
And with this stupendous prospect ahead Premier
Gregory Wade and his Treasurer, Waddell, seem quite
unmoved. The Deform Government seems bent on
making the biggest and most incapable monetary smash
in N.S.W. history.
* * * *
Prime Minister Fisher’s scheme for a
Federal note issue looks more unsatisfactory the
more closely it is inspected. Fisher reckons that the
Commonwealth can absorb and use about £4,000 000
worth of Federal paper, and if the private issues of’the
banks are cancelled there seems no reason why, under
fair conditions, it should not do so. If the very foolish
and useless and costly half-sovereign were abolished and
replaced by a 10s. note, the Commonwealth should use
even more paper money than the amount mentioned
And the half-sovereign should be abolished. The wear
and tear of gold coin that is in constant circulation is a
woeful loss, and it seems especially woeful when one re-
collects that the wear is quite needless ; so long as the
public knows that the note it uses is represented by a
sovereign, and that the coin is available if wanted,
it would be satisfied, and the constant handling
and rubbing away of the actual money till it reaches
the stage when total disappearance sets in is wholly
unnecessary. And the half-sovereign, which is a thin,
frail little coin, with much wearing surface and little
body, is especially wasteful and wearable. Assuming that
this coin was retired and boiled down, there should be
immediate room in the Commonwealth for £5,000,000 or
£6,000,000 of paper money, provided the experiment re-
ceives fair treatment.
Unfortunately, it will require very careful legis-
-1 ition to make sure of fair treatment. Notes are always
wandering into banks, and if the banks are allowed, in-
stead of paying them out again, to insist on giving their
customers gold, while the3 r dump the Government
paper down on the Treasury counter and holler for
cash in exchange, there will be very little note
circulation, and what there is will be a pre-
carious animal. Queensland certainly runs a success-
ful State note issue, hut the banks were allowed to drive a
desperately hard bargain with the Government before
they would help to circulate this paper money. Fisher
talks of an issue of £4,000,000, against which the Federal
Treasury would hold £1,000,000 in gold. A million might
not be enough, if the banks were allowed freedom to con-
spire against the scheme. And even then the Govern-
ment would only have the precarious use of £3,000,000,
which, invested at 3& per cent., would supply an income
of about £lOO,OOO a year net. This money, it is pro-
pounded, is to be spent on reproductive works, and the
profits of these, if any—it is wonderful how unproductive
some reproductive works are—will go into the Treasury
and, presumably, be used for more reproductive works.
As the Commonwealth has always paid for its works
out of revenue, this means that the profit of
the note issue will be used as revenue. It will not form
afund to accumulate at compound interest and wipe off
the State debts, or anything 1 of that sort ; therefore the
security set aside against the notes will not increase in
any way. And the revenue which the device is supposed
to produce (£lOO,OOO a year) looks very small considering
the trouble and the possible risks.
Against this device of Fisher’s The Bulletin
again advances its proposal that Australia should adopt
the Canadian banking system, whereby the banks are re-
quired to hold 40 per cent, at least of their cash reserves
in Government paper, and that the money thus acquired
(less 20 per cent, set aside as a reserve against any sudden
emergency), instead of being used for public works,
should be set aside as a sinking fund to accumulate at
compound interest for the extinction of the public debts
of the States. The principal reasons why it prefers this
scheme are these :
(1) It would yield much more money. The mere ex-
change of 40 per cent, of the banks’ cash reserves for
federal paper means that the Government would get the
use of about £10,000,000 in coin, and the notes in actual
circulation would greatlv increase this amount. Putting
the figure, however, at £10,000,000, and allowing fora
gold reserve of £2,000,000 against the notes, the Federal
Government would h ive the use of £8,000,000.
• J he , u P kee P of the circulation would cost less than
in 1 isher s scheme, for a very large proportion of the
notes would lie in the banks’ strong rooms and suffer no
wear and tear whatsoever.
(3) There would be hardly any possibility of any con-
certed attempt to demand cash for ruinouslv large
parcels of notes. If a bank’s cash reserves fell, it could,
of course, demand gold for as many of its notes as would
prevent its holding of Federal paper going above 40 per
cent., but that would be a small matter.
(4) The Bulletin’s scheme would be much more
strongly fortified and entrenched than Fisher’s. Fisher
proposes to issue £4,000,000 in notes, cash for which can
demanded any time, and to hold against them, say,
£1,000,000 in gold, which reserve will never increase. It
is quite possible to conceive circumstances under which
such a reserve would be insufficient. The Bulletin pro-
poses an issue of at least £10,000,000 of paper for which
cash can t be demanded to any great extent or in any
sudden fashion. Against this liability it proposes a
reserve which, even in its first year, will equal
£2,000,000 cash and £8,000,000 in State securities—
in short, a reserve of 100 per cent. ; and through the
operation of the law of compound interest this reserve
would increase until it consisted of £2,000,000 in gold
and hundreds of millions in State securities.
Therefore The Bulletin claims that its scheme
would be vastly the safer and more profitable of the two.
And t here would be about it no suspicion of a charge that
the profits of the note issue were being used as revenue *
therefore it would look more honest. Fisher’s scheme’
suffers from the incurable drawback that the profits are
to be spent on reproductive works, and the Government
of the moment would define wbat are “reproductive
works.” And when some of them had finished defining
the proceeds of Fisher’s note issue would be liable to be
diverted to very strange purposes indeed.

There is a possibility that the wild action of
Premier Joseph Ward, of Maoriland, in offering, with-
out the authority of Parliament or the people, one’or two
first-class battleships to Britain, will be the last straw
that will break the camel’s back. Ward’s utterly insane
borrowing policy has made a diseased boom in Maoriland
such as even that country lias never known before. City
land values have rushed up till, in the little capital of
Wellington, a ramshackle wooden house, perched on a
sort of shelf or niche cut in the side of a hill, with a pre-
cipice rising up behind and a precipice dropping down in
front, costs more than a stone cottage, with an acre of
level ground, in the outskirts of Sydney or Melbourne.
They have rushed up till the owner'of one allotment in
the business part of Wellington has been asking more for
his bit of land than the same sort of place would be worth
m a. good business part of either of Australia’s two big
cities. And at the same time the same owner has been
trying surreptitiously to sell the property at 33 per cent,
reduction in Melbourne ; and Melbourne, speculative as it
is, has howled with mirth at the proposition. The owner
dare not out his price in Maoriland,'lest the visible slump
should start the first beginnings of a panic, and thus
prick the boom bubble, and the values of all his other
properties should go down with a crash; but his desire
to unload outside Maoriland, even at a great paper sacri-
fice, is pathetic. Bank of New Zealand shares have been
boomed up till the dividend at one time represented less
than 3 per cent, on their nominal value. The Maoriland
financial institutions are reported to be loaded with
securities on which they have advanced money at wild
and hilarious valuations ; and now Premier Ward speaks
to them severely, and says that they must produce more
money to lend on more wild and hilarious valuations, or
else he will find other banks to compete with them.
Maoriland borrows £2,000,000 or more per annum in
London, Sydney and Melbourne, in order to keep the
boom afloat, and in order to get this money it often
pays rates of interest which no Australian State
dreams of, bad as some Australian States are.
One circumstance which has helped to postpone
trouble is the fact that Maoriland has hardly any
renewal loans to float. Years ago it did, at serious loss,
a huge “conversion” operation, whereby a multitude of
small loans, falling due at a multitude of early and in-
convenient dates, were converted into one great loan of
nearly £30,000,000, falling due in one great shock or heap
in the year 1929 ; while two other memorable slabs of
liability happen along in 1949 and 1945. This costly post-
ponement helps to keep the Maoriland finances off the
rocks, for it is quite possible to borrow £2,000,000 as a
new loan in any given year, while a demand for a new
loan of £2,000,000 together with £3,000,000 for the re-
newal of an old loan would break the back of Cohen, the
overburdened camel. But Maoriland is now up against
these propositions: (1) that its land boom values are
tottering ; (2) that its Premier has been reduced to using
threatening language to the hanks to drive them into
finding more money to lend to keep the boom afloat; (3)
that the country has got into the habit of borrowing* even
more than £2,000,000 a year—in fact some years it gets
nearer to £3,000,000, which is an awful figure for a State
with less than a million people.; (4) that London has a
slump on hand and both Melbourne and Sydney fancy
that lean times are coming, therefore the sources of
Maoriland’s loan supplies threaten to dry up to some
extent; and (5) that this time, of all times, is the time
that a maddened and irresponsible Premier has selected
to commit the country, without the authority of either
Parliament or the people, to an extra liability of about
£2,000,000 or £4,000,000. It isn’t a good occasion for
taking risks of that sort. If Parliament absolutely re-
fuses to find the money, Joseph Ward will look about the
smallest person in the British Empire. And if it doesn’t
refuse, this extra liability may precipitate a financial
downfall in which very many millions of Maoriland’s
alleged wealth will disappear, and before the ruin is
cleared up many of Ward’s present supporters may be
found amid the crowd at the side-door of the soup-kitchen.

Victoria, after a lengthy spell of financial
sobriety, has started loan-mongering again, and has bor-
rowed £1,500,000 in London U per cent. It seems a
strangely superfluous proceeding when all things are
considered. For instance, Victoria has over 3,400.000 acres
of good land which it has let out, mostly to wealthy men,
on leases that won't expire till 1920,‘at rents varying
from Id. to 3d. per acre. And the State doesn’t get even
these beggarly rents, for the lessees (mostly affluent men)
have a right, before the leases expire, to buy up large
areas for themselves and large areas for their wives
and children at prices which range from 10s. to £1
per acre, and all the rent they have paid is to be reckoned
as part of the purchase money. As the rent is part of
the purchase money, it follows that Victoria is gettingno
rent at all. Now this land, which the State of Victoria
gives away to affluent men at no rent at all,
is the sort of land which the private owner
lets out at a rental of from 20s. to 30s. per
acre per annum. Call the private owner’s rent 20s.
per acre per annum, and you strike the fact that Victoria
is fooling away, as a gift to affluent and undeserving
citizens, about £3,400,000 every year. In return for this
it gets great empty spaces, * depopulation, poverty,
misery, and a steadily declining position among the States
of the Commonwealth. And, being hard-up through
giving all this land away rent free to affluent and un-
deserving inhabitants, it is reduced to borrowing
£1,500,000 in London at 3J per cent.

The giant Australian office has just celebrated its sixtieth
birth-year by adding to its funds the immense sum qf
£l,o76,22o—approximately, half the price of a Dread-
nought. The past decade has seen an increase in ifs
funds of 61.7 percent. ; in policies of 59.1 per cent.; a/d
in annual income of 45.9 per cent. You can’t qlll
figures like that dull; they have an 18-carat gleam/m
them that attracts the eye like , the window-show <f a
good jeweller’s. But the extra gilding has meant e/tra
outlay, for management expenses have moved up fom
13.9 per cent, of premium receipts, in 1907, to U.f> in
1908. The actuary’s report breaks it gently this /’ay:
“It will therefore be seen that notwithstanding the
large increase in the volume of new business and tlf fact
that the entire establishment cost of the London ranch
has been included in the general expenses of th/year,
the expense rate has only been fractionally incjfased.”
It is certainly better than a heavy increase ; but these
figures should be going astern.
On the basis of total income, also, the year’s
expense rate does not compare favorably wit# its near
relations

That is a rather precipitate retreat from the figures of a
year ag - o, and . still more so from those of?l901, which,
however, was a record year, and not easy tolive up to.

A glance at the last three columns shows how safely
things have gone since 1895 ; also it shows how slight the
fluctuations have been for the last three years. The
gradual fading of the policy loans item is a pleasing cir-
cumstance ; and the gradual increase of the pro-
portion of the funds represented by public securities
continues. In 1905 only 6'9 of the Society’s cash was
invested in this way ; in 1905 it had climbed to 26'6 ; 1906
saw it at 29’2 ; and the records for 1907 and 1908 have
been, respectively, 31’6 and 32T. Certainly, it does not
make for large interest earnings ; but while our share of
the Universe holds together that 32T is absolutely safe.
It is worth while chipping a few’ pence off profits for the
peace of mind that reflection brings. The assets taken
into account in the foregoing include, besides the insur-
ance fund, the reserve to provide for depreciation of
securities (.£140,509, as against £123,158 a year ago).
During the year, £19,759 has been added to this fund and
charged against revenue ; so that has been w’ritten
off during the year, in addition to the i£20,955 of writings-
off charged to revenue direct. As against the £19,759
which has been added to the depreciation fund and
charged to revenue account, £11,077, being surplus on
properties sold, has been included in revenue account.
The giant’s baby is doing “as well as can be
expected.” (The words of the actuary are “making
satisfactory progress ”): —

The cost of leg-roping new business has come down sub-
stantially ; last year, an outlay o/ £BB 14s. lid. was
required ; this year the figures are £66 7s. per cent.—
which is an improvement of £22 7s. lid. per cent. But
though the results are better, a suspicion still lingers
that they aren’t good enough, and that the industrial
business would have been better left alone.
The giant’s surplus for the year was £850,945,
out of which £732,445 will be distributed in bonuses.

Interim bonuses have been paid, which brine the total
for the past term up to 36'8—which is a trifle better than
the handsome 36’5 of 1907. The story of the A.M.P. is a
very lone and magnificent narrative in figures, and it
reads opulently. If the office has failed in some respects
to quite keep up with the record of the past, the responsi-
bility probably rests with the foolish London office ex-
periment. The institution went there to struggle for
business in an overcrowded market, just in time to be
present at the great commercial slump and to pay its
share of the gorgeous new taxation which Lloyd-George
has invented.

By the time the Australasia’s accounts reach Australasia
they are comparatively ancient banking history. The bal-
ance-sheet for the half-year ended October, ’OB, is only just
to hand from London ; and now the first week of May lias
fled past us, and th 6 clerks are busy adding up the figures
for the term ended April, ’O9; these figures will reach us
in a footsore condition about November, when the year
is drawing to a close, and iced drinks are among the
necessaries of life. So far as some banking figures go, the
Commonwealth travels in the guard’s van at the end of
the train, and has a magnificent view of the coun-
try the rest of the caravan has passed through
before it. Looking at the profit column of the above
table, the pendulum seems to have swung back pretty
evenly this term. The October, ’O7, profits (£188,750)
were £38,713 below those for April of that year (£227,463);
April, ’OB, saw a return flight to £212,029 ; and now Octo-
ber,’oB, balances with £187,691 —or within £1059 of the
October, ’O7, amount. It is remarkably even. The re-
covery of debts which had been written off as bad pro-
bably accounts for some of the recent heavy' increase in
profits since about April, ’O7 ; but the real facts cannot be
extracted from the published figures. The extra 2 per
cent.which was added to the dividend first in October,
’O6, and paid as a bonus, is still continued in that way,
though the fact that it is the fifth of the series looks as if
it is the sort of extra plum a shareholder might count on
without being considered reckless.
On the basis of capital and reserves, the earn-
ings for the term show a decrease, though they are still
exceedingly handsome. A comparison with some preced-
ing half-years :

The liabilities of the bank amount to £lB.l74,BB4—which
works out at £5 12s. Bd. for every £1 of the shareholders’
money ; also, the proportion of the liabilities represented
by liquid assets is a shade over 32 per cent. The steady
writing down of premises has brought the value of the
bank’s domicile down to £l9s,l27—which is £44,445 less
than in October, ’O7. Nearly £lOO,OOO has been lopped off
this item since October, ’O5, and, at the present rate, the
thing will be utterly wiped out about 1922. Presumably,
however, the big and prosperous’Asia would never con-
sent to bring out a balance-sheet in which its magnificent

The C.S.R. Co., since last balance, has increased its capi-
tal from £2,500,000 to £2,850,000, by the issue of 17,500
£2O bonus shares. To make up the cash to pay for these
shares, £350,000 of reserves has been capitalised. The
reserves—on paper, anyhow—now look very shrunken
when compared with the bloated figures of past years ;
but reserves are rarely what they seem, and those of the
C.S.R. are no exception to the golden rule. One matter
worthy of note is that the co. has £500,000 put away as a
fund for replacements and depreciation, vet there is
strong reason to suspect that it pays for all “depreciation
and replacements out of current earnings, and that
there is no liability whatever against this fund. In
other words, it is suspected of being a real reserve
fund, thinly disguised lest too much attention should
be drawn to the bloatedness of the monopoly.
It is interesting to note the remarkable regularity with
which this big concern, year after year, just earns—on
paper—a little more than its dividend ; and then, when it
decided to pay a jubilee bonus to its shareholders, how
profits sprang up £50,000 like the Jumping Frog after the
shot had been emptied out of it. The co., this half, has
not only abbreviated its accounts, but has presented
them in a somewhat different form. On the chairman’s
authority, the alterations are “devoid of importance”;
they have, however, the effect of making it a little more
difficult to draw comparisons between this and previous
terms, with a view'to getting at the things the balance-
sheet doesn’t talk about. The following is as near as this
paper can get to the viewpoint which the fuller details of
other reports made rather easy of access :

Iho Callow Revolving Hand Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it lias already done In America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
Improved extraction In the mills. At Hroken Hill It has
been especially successful. It Is an unqualified success as a
line ivet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it Is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With It there Is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine Is a travelling hand or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum ox er which the ore and Its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt Is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to lie screened.
The machine is fully protected by patent rights. For
further particulars apply to the Austral Otis Engineering

The steady-going Union Trustee Co. this year produces a
lulanoe-lhent showing a decrease in profits of £033 as
cuiupared to last year ; hut either things are better than
they look, or else t he Chairman was wearing his rose-
tinted glasses at the annual meeting, for at that solemn
fundi n he broke the new* to the assembled shareholders
that a 0 per cent, dividend had only been avoided by the
narrowest margin. The glad news, however, was over-
shadowed by an “if," and Shukspeare aside—there
wasn’t much virtue in It: " If, In the year now being
entered upon, they could secure an average number of
estates, they would be able to add another 1 per cent, to
Iho dividend.... That rate could have been paid this
year, but It was thought better to wait a little longer,
and make more certain that when It was increased there
would be little likelihood of It ever being lowered. The
dwlreof the directors was that shareholders might rely
on a regular half-yearly return on their Investment In the
company's shares." The paid capital of the co. is large
t<* the business: £73,882 (or £1 per share) has been called
tip, ami shareholders are liable for a further 10s., anti
another £1 In case of liipiidatlon. Of the £82,004 worth of
assets, only £9090 is In real estate, and £21,777 is In mort-
gages ; the h dance is in cash, public stock, and similar
things. The size of the capital and the quality of the
assets (which are set forth in detail) make fine security
for clients; also, the man gement seems to possess an
admirable gift for making haste slow ly. Take it all In all,
the Union looks as if it deserved the new business and

Tliis theatre, which was for so long the home of
lllan'olt, can see its road clear till about 1912, when May-
nell and Ounn's five-years’ lease expires. The Koval is
about the most centrally situated of the Melbourne
theatres, and it should by rights have been a brick-arid-
umrtar gold-mine to its owners. The building, however,
i« on leased land, and a heavy Old Man of the Kea in the
shape of a ground rental of £lBOO per year sits ever on
the roof; and it takes oceans of limelight and mnnv
quarts of heroine's hitter tears to raise ttiat amount of
money. The Royal would seem to be immune from
moths, rust, and the other devourers of worldly wealth,
for nothing has been written off for depreciation since
the middle of 1900. In palliation of this, it must be men-
tioned that undivided profits have and are being applied
to the reduction of the overdraft Incurred by reason of
the alterations made to the property in 1905. During the
PJJJ* l *rm that dead weight, has been reduced to £3394 ;
»un, the hero will have to swell round a good deal to wipe

‘Manor”: The graves of recent Gippsland wild
cits are monumented by deserted and played-out dredge-
noughts, and they are fairly numerous aiong the water-
Jf*!* 1 )' the hills. A very wild feline of the* hunch was
the Nicholson River animal, which won about 250 z. of
gold for nearly two years' work, and ended bv leaving
its waged,oilers unpaid. The last .lodge of the hopeless
'Wedging co., when calls are dead, is a tribute arrange-
ment, under which the tributers collar all the gold if the
gross yield does not pan out wages ; if the clean-up is
over that level the co. comes in fora percentage. But
the yield is never within coo-ee of wages. F'rinstance,
the Dargo dredge’s last paddock returned 11s. per week
per miner. Worse still, the final flutter of Ihe Bulum-

“E.” writes: —At the present moment the
copper market shows a decided inclination to jump, and a
further rise may possibly cause the Great Australian Ex-
ploration to reconsider the decision to close down the
smelters at the end of the month. The Chillagoe Co. has
also found it necessary to temporarily discontinue copper
smelting, and the northern fields become more desolate
every day. Chillagoe has a metallurgical problem to
face in the treatment of the copper ore from the Daintree
property, recently acquired. An appreciable amount of
bismuth in the ore makes it inadvisable to smelt direct
to blister copper, as this product becomes practically un-
saleable when it contains little more than a trace of
bismuth as an impurity. The probabilities are that the
ore will be smelted with lead matte, which will have the
effect of collecting the bismuth in lend bullion, giving it
a market value, and at the same time deeiease the
amount of lead, otherwise valueless, in the matte and in-
crease the percentage of copper.
During 1908, Mount Morgan (Queensland) pro-
duced £1,017,360 worth of gold and copper. The yellow
metal was worth £610,870, or two-thirds of the total.
The monthly average for 1«08 was £81,771. which makes
the returns this year look indifferent. Mount Morgan
depends on ricli stopos to maintain a high average, so
when everything lias neon made secure again at the 860 ft,
level the returns are likely to improve. To show how
much tlie copper ore recently smelted has shrunk in
value, the return for August, 1008, may he compared
with that of last month. The two months had
practically the same tonnage (16,780 tons for August,
1008, anil 16,008 tons for April, 1000), yet during
August, 1908, the copper furnaces produced iso
tons more copper and twice as much gold os com-
pared with April, 1000. hast mouth's furnace reoovery
averaged £3 7s. 6d, (20 per cent, copper and S7dwi.
gold); so, judging by the very moderate mottle shown in
the last report, the immediate outlook i« not a lilt too
cheerful. It l» Mount Morgan’- ambition to become
practically self-fluxing by the use of lluxi* from
th- Many I'vuks, which contain a little copper. Tin-linking
of two,,- at mines with a railway, and the Imppy union of
sllicioue vvitu Utile r*-e in the smelter, opens a new era In
Queensland mining history.
Mills’ United (Charters Towers, Queensland)
made a half-yearly profit of £13,003, front 26,878 tons of
stone, which returned the high average of £1 6s. 3d. per
ton. After payment of three dividends amounting to
£45,000 and dividend-tax of £2260, the cash balance
stands at £15.630. There isn't much to growl at,
although the decline In cash and ore reserves during
Inst half-year Indicates the way things are going.
Recent crushlngs have not been so good as usual,
although, of course, the last clean-up of £6860 from
1683 tons leaves a handsome profit, Development work
has not been satisfactory In the large art a of ground
between No. 13 and No. In levels. The rise between these
levels will, however, facilitate a thorough test of the reef.
Tlterc is, unfortunately, a lot of white barren quartz, and
these big blanks have caused the Day Dawn to ba called a
freak reef. The hanging wall reef and the extension of
both sections into the adjoining North Brilliant Freehold
are of the same patchy nature. But a reef that can con-
tain so many blanks, and yet produce such a large ton-
nage of rich stone hardly deserve- to he called a freak.
The Carrington United (Charters Towers,
Queensland) is doing better than of old. The half-
year's work was 2460 tons of ore crushing 16307. and
112 tons concentrate- worth £6393. The debit at the
beginning of the half-year wan £6851, of which all but
£665 has been wiped off! To assist. In this, copper on hand
realised £ll2O and calls £1597. The actual working profit
for the term was £2288, pint the net value of the concen-
trates produced, which are estimated to give a net profit
of £2160.

“E.” writes:—They are trying to float a
Dreadnought of their own in the North, and if reports
are reliable the new tin show bearing this title
should soon be launched. The only surprising thing is
that the prospectors should be willing to part with a pro-
perty like this—a 70ft. shaft, a lode said to be 10ft. wide,
and crushing 13J per cent, of tin. This promising pros-
pect Is about live miles front Coolgarra, and is close to the
Burns shaft. The flotation is in the hands of Brownlie, of
Chillagoe, who got off the Tommy Burns; and the £5
dividend of the latter should help the Dreadnought along.

New Brilliant Freehold (Charters Towers,
Queensland) has connected' its shaft with No. 7 level on
the m -in Day Dawn reef. A current of air is clearing the
muggy atmosphere through the long levels to Mills’
United. The output will probably soon increase, for_ the
mine lias two good blocks of ground available, from No. 8
to the Mexican boundary and between No. 7 and No. 6 on
the hanging wall reef." But both sections require an
ex 1 tnsion of levels, winzes, rises and other development
work to prepare the mine for extensive stoping. Apart
front this, the N.B.F. has a lot of development
in hand on its own account from the shaft, and in con-
junction with Mills' United diamond drill bore. A recent
crushing returned £1872 from 887 tons. Pfeiffer's Day
Daw n is on the western side, and although poor returns
and a call have discouraged the market, a good deal of
interest Is manifested in the deepening of the underlie
below No. 9. This level has been driven east and west
with somewhat patchy prospects through a reef Ift. wide.
The Inst crushing only averaged £ll,llO, w hich was not
enough to pay expenses.

Queensland's production of lode and stream tin
has shown a remarkable decline. No dotiht many big
mines such as Smith's Creek, Stannary Hills, ant) the
Vulcan have been unproductive, which may account for
the slump in the value of the last quarterly return of lode
tin to £19,682 as compared with £58.728 for the corre-
sponding quarter last year. Last year’s return was 4825
tons, valued at £312.191, Which shows that it wasn't
metal but black tin oxide, worth between £7oand £BO per
ton. Queensland makes a poor show considering that its
surface tin bearing area is one of the largest in the world.
Probably better things are in store ; at any rate some new-
rich discoveries and the re-starting of Smith's Creek and
Stannary Hills inspire that hope. The Tommy Burns
continues to give splendid battery returns and big divi-
dends ; a small syndicate can do very well out of a pro-
duction of a few tons of carefully picked stuff per day.
The trouble is to get pack-horses to carry the ore over a
few miles of rough country to the battery. Values will
probably stick about £9 a ton for some' time. A dis-
covery has also been made at Coolgarra (frvinebank), and
a return of 13J per cent, has been obtained from 100 tons.
This show has been named Dreadnought.
Great Fitzroy copper (Rockhampton, Queens-
land) is to have a new water-jacket furnace of Australian
make and design, which will give the Fitzroy works a
capacity of about 800 tons per day. It is something to
get a furnace adapted to a particular class of ore, and the
smelting of 36,262 tons of ore in the original furnace for
an average recovery of 2 "91 per cent, copper, and 33dwt.
of gold in copper matte, show s what has been done during
the past 12 months. Smelting and mining costs are
approximately 325. per ton, but it should be observed
that there are many expenses, such as convert-
ing matte into blister copper, and refining the
latter, that are left out of the calculation. At
present the production of copper is about 1000 tong a
year, and directors, managers, and the London office are
rather a heavy tax on such a small output. Great
Fitzroy is an immense irregular-shaped ore body, and its
i*°‘AV a °!“ ? ther n,ines - il ® generally silicious nature
, . five it some resemblance to Mount
Morgan. At the deepest level (300 ft.) copper assavs are
i" e but cold assays show a decline! The
level < sft, overhead has a face proportion of basic ore
* hlch accounts for the low costs of smelting. No doubt
some selection of ore has been made to counterbalance
low prices, but, for all that, this biff copper show should
give a good account of itself.

“ Quan ’: The Great Australian mine and
smelting works at Cloncurry (N.Q.) are closing down on
June 1. This is a nasty knock for Cloncurrv, for the

the chief support of the field for some time.

At the Kangiara mines (N.8.W.), the general
manager s report shows tliut the company had realised
*Blll2 from the sale of ore up to March 31. Ore •* m
sight' is put down at *166,000. This ore “in sight "is
partly on the surface and partly below. The mine is
developing excellently us far as gross values go. The
management sums things up thus: " The great bulk of
i?i*T mixture of the two (i.e. copper and lead
sulphides). . . . and can easily be diessed by water con-
centration or smelting, whichever is deemed advisable
later on. ‘ Concentration will undoubtedly get rid of the
gnnguu matter in the lode. It is difficult to understand
what can be done with a mixed concentrate when the
company is not marketing any mixed ore locally. More
especially as much of this ore is described - by the
in ne reports as “clean." That the smelting of
mixed ore cun be successfully carried out is
instanced by the Ohlllsfoe Company (N.Q.). There
a much more difficult metallurgical problem has been
solved tlian Kangiaru promlsvs to be. Nacessar.v con-
ditions are an elaborate plant and large tonnage,
hangiura lias yet to develop far below Its present depth
(I >oft.) before It can produce the latter. A lead furnace,
built at Moris Dock in 188(1, lias been Installed at Hie
mine, but Is not likely to go outside its province, w hich
is to make lead. Further, only 3(KWi tons of oxidised ores
are reported, anti when these are exhausted the reign of
the furnace will lie over unless a roasting plant Is
acquired. Much apace has recently been occupied by the
management In oombating some Imaginary “ xlno bogev,"
ri'e greatest trouble caused In ibis direction Is when eftio
blende replaces the more valuable minerals. Asregaids
treatment—the handling of xina ores on furnace charges
is quite well understood! Also, Australian metallurgists
show otliers the way us regards the concentration of such
ores.

Kangiiun in its first report thrown out an esti-
mate of ore reserves valued at A total of 3133
tons have heen raised for 266 ft. of driving and the sloping
done above the 110 ft. level. The 803 tons sent to smelters
was worth *8402. or about *lO 11s. Od. per ton ; and
2330 tons on dumps are roughly valued at *14,322, say an
average of *0 per ton, which is hurdly rich enough to
stand charges on mixed copper-lead ore. It I* estimated
that there are five times as much ore above the
110 ft. level as that taken out, so after includ-
ing large quantities of low-grade ore worth £3 10s.,
the reserves ore brought up to *166,000. This may he
near enough to the mark, hut it is not at all easy to get a
clear Idea of the profit. Copper and lead mines are in the
habit—when times are dull—of taking out Kangiara’s
little lot, just to keep things going. Mungana (Queens-
land), for instance, produced *122,000 worth of copper,
lend, nnd silver last year for mighty little profit. Sonic of
the Broken Kill mines have been struggling with mining
and smelting costs for years, and have exhausted an
enormous pile of ore without paying a single dividend.
Kangi .ru is in a small way ; yet It calmly estimates a 60
per cent, profit on gross values, some of which do not
exceed £0 per ton of ore.

lie Kyloe Copper Mine (Adaminaby, N.S.W.).
Development work at No. 3 level continues satisfactorily,
but this is of little Interest compared with the fact that
the main shaft is nearing the depth at which No. 4 will be
driven. The lode is expected within a few feet of the
shaft, No. 3 Is out 400 ft., and after passing through the
prill ore has been in stuff which should be profitably
handled by the long-talked-of mill. Above No. 2 level
the mine is supposed to contain 12,000 tons worth 6 per
cent, copper, and there is a heap on the surface. This
makes about the tonnage required to muintain the pre-
sent output 12 months. No. 3 being a good level, the
position looks encouraging, provided the stopes realise
the reported values. The present working scheme is to
keep the mill going on prill ore from above No. 8 until
the mill is running. The ore is ehalcopyrite contained
by a clean quart!! gangue, so no difficulties are in the way
of making a good concentrate. Treatment consists of
hand sorting the prill ore, heap roasting, and re-
verb. smelting, with an nddition of limestone. Fines
are blast roasted in a MacMurty pot. Products from
furnace are matte carrying 66 per cent, copper, and slag
running 2 per cent, copper. High silica slags are made
by forming a quantity of liquid slag in which lumps of
silica are floated, the copper values being leached out by
the corrosive action of the liquid slag. Taking the
capacity of the mill (to be constructed) at the estimated
daily tonnage (60 tons) and the working tonnage of the
furnace (6CJ per week is a favorite), there is little room
for an increased output of copper. Future expansion
will depend on what amount of prill ore No. 4 level con-
tains. Apart, from an increased output there is room for
some profit by acut in exes. Present method of concen-
tration (hand -sorting) is notoriously expensive. Adminis-
tration and other charges outside the working account
look heavy enough to strangle a much larger show.

Giulia Copper Mine (N.S. W.) is confining itself
to development. In company with other N.S.W. copper
shows, Cadia has been worked in a haphazard fashion for
many years, blit now seems to have adopted a fairly busi-
nesslike policy. The keeping of an intelligent system of
mine accounts used to be regarded os quite unnecessary,
and individual eoiU have been merely items requiring a
vivid imagination. New management has commenced,
nnd stoping and smelting operations have ceased. Pros-
peels are now being investigated. The mine has 120,000
tons of 4 per cent, ore developed and an odds-on chance of
finding more. Mining operation* are hampered by the
excessive timitering required. This it due to the fact
that the company is under agreement not to break the
overburden. Further, the lode has a flat underlie, and
no filling is available. Treatment by the present reverb,
plant is knocked on the head by excessive consumption
of fuel. Too little sulphur and too much alumina make
it a doubtful blast-furnace proposition. It is hoped the
present development work will result in the removal of at
least one of the difficulties, and indicate a policy which
will permit of profitable working.

“ Widgeon In B. 29/4/ 09 it is stated that the
479-ton output of the Great Cobar (N.S. W.), for March,
is easily a record for the new plant. It it doubtful
whether such output is that of the new plant, lor
during the past few months about 14 of the furnaces at
the Lithgow works have been dismantled and their
bottoms smelted in the one or two furnsccs left standing.
Ilow much of the March output came from those bottoms
is not disclosed, but as the furnaces from which they
came have been working uninterruptedly for years, it
should be considerable. Your conclusion of a 20,000-ton
tonnage is apparently incorrect, as being based on wrong
assumptions. Until definite information as to the pro-
Krlion of the output attributable to the old furnace
ttoms is supplied, disbelief in the capacity of the new
plant to satisfactorily treat the ore will doubtless con-
tinue.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
, T _ Sydney, May 11, 1909,
My Dear Arini,—
This is the kind of thing that is liable to leap
across one s matin egg at one any day these troub-
le® times. I rent it from a daily paper last
Monday. Rev. W. Nicholson, one of the visiting
American evangelists, was speaking at Collina--
wood Town Hall B
Hell is a place of death, the terror of kings, and the
king of terrors. It is a place of death, and still they never
the Jt is a living death. It is dying and dvirig, and
yet there is no cessation of life. It is a place of physical
suttering. Man s memory will make it Hell, when his
past sins awaken and appear like 10,000 mirrors around,
when death makes life so horrible that men would com-
mit suicide ; but there is no suicide in Hell. Memory
will be awakened • but there will be no whisky to still
the memory. All the glories of Heaven you would sell
for a glass of beer, a game of cards, or a night at the
opera. When you open your eyes in Hell you will have
an adequate idea of these glories that will make your Heli
awful. Oh ! the anguish of memory thus aroused ! You
are lost* lost, lost, and in Hell for ever a<rain and a train
If you had all the millions of the world in Hell with you
£u U it, oUld £ lv e every million to get one more chance
Oh . the anguish of your soul in Hell. When you remem-
ber that, you will shut your eyes. You will try to stop
thinking; but all your efforts will be unavailing You
will renumber your mother’s t ars, and your father’s
prayers will haunt .you. Ob, God ! the horror of recol-
leetmg . My God ! what,a sensation when you awake in
Hell!
“ The_Great Experiment,” a story in the cur-
current Lone Hand, deals with this subject along
JNieholsonia.li lines. The writer tells how a band
of mining men delved over-deep in their quest of
knowledge. They penetrated beneath the very
Root of Evil itself, with horrid results. Consider
this :
There was yet another blood-curdling howl from the
borehole ; but we had heard so many of them by this
time that we stood our ground.
“We’ve holed through into some place,” said Daniels
triumphantly “Now then, haul up, and we’ll find out
the meaning of it all. Go ahead.”
v y«, all gathered round in absolute fascination and
' va, l t f d - v T here was a look of expectancy in every face,
and the light overhead shone down on five ashen visages
and one—that belonging to Tanjia Topee—of greyish blue.
And as we stood there the drill was drawn out, and
attached to it was a freshly-severed Tail ! It
was covered with a horny incrustation, as if it
had been japanned, and at the end of it was a
spike The drill had severed it just at the root, and
brought it away impaled on the point. Daniels made a
snatch at it, but at the same instant he dropped it with
fearful imprecations. Ic was worse than red-hot. And
as we listened petrified and spell-bound, I heard a deep
bass voice howling in a strange, uncouth language aima-
rentl.y halfway up the borehole.... FF
“ That’s Syriac,” said Venables briefly, and then, with a
shriek of terror, he galloped for th * shaft.
We waited for the tenth part of an instant, and saw a
horrid-looking head and face, which might have been
human only for the indelible traces left by 6000 years of
hre and blasphemy, come up out of the hole
Both conceptions are absorbing, not to say en-
thralling. to persons of imagination. The framers
of them visualise the awful locality they discuss
with crystal-clear eyes. Plainly no boiling caul-
clron or red hot meat-hook in the entire demesne
is hidden from them. And vet religious folk as a
whole dissent. Rev. Edgar, of the Methodist
Church says that Brother Nicholson is too
Jund for him; and another cleric avers that he is
‘‘ashamed ” of one who could draw such an inartis-
tically ghastly picture. For my part. I was always
taught as a child that “ Hell-fire ’’—the eternal
borne that awaited the little girl who called her
brother a “ pig-dog ’’—was just such a spot as is
indicated above. Whenever I think on this
dreary subject X picture it that way now—namely
as no pleasure-resort, but rather as a place which
closely resembles the bookmakers’ ring at Rand-
wick on a warm summer’s day. Why is it then
that I am constantly meeting people who argue
that theologists of the Nicholson brand deserve
to be arrested and smartly punished for using
threatening language in a public place? This
attitude strikes me as both illogical and unfair.
One J. W. R. Clarke writes to the newspapers
denouncing the cruelty of some persons in high
positions who robbed the Shackelton expedition’s
Esquimaux dog mother of her puppies when they
were only a month old. Two offenders are
named ; Lord Dudley got one pup and Admiral
Poore another. The third puppy was intended
for Queen Alexandra, but it was stolen, and that
left the mother a bereaved doggess. Then there
was a voice heard in Ramah. as the Scripture has
it—the voice of Rachel barking for her children
and refusing to be comforted.
Mayoress Allen Taylor, in grey raiment—not
the dismal grey of the pessimist, but the silver
grey that, according to the optimist, lines the
darkest cloud—watched Sydnev Comedy Club do
a play in aid of her Thirlmere Endowment Fund.
The chieftainess’s cheerful silver grey hat, how-
ever, obstructed the view so effectively that several
persons became pessimists for one afternoon only.
For the play was a matinee performance.
It was also in the ‘‘ immediate presence”
of the Dudley Excellencies, who seemed to
spend a pleasant Saturday afternoon watching
Esmond’s “When We Were Twenty-One,”
played by amateurs. Her Ex appeared in London
smoke or mole chiffon, and her bright, bird-like
eyes glanced from under a hat (with a chou) of the
same murky shade. Sydney was beginning to
think she had none but white or pale lavender
garnitures. The comedy was well acted on the
whole, and prettily produced. Of the four princi-
pal men who are supposed to be on the shady side
of forty, only two made up to look their parts
The other two stayed young and salad-like. The
women in the cast were weak, and their perform-
ance tottered a good deal on its feet. Miss E.
Hellyer, as a French maid, was the best, and
Miss G. Eaton, who made one minute’s appearance
in a highflyer part, was very promising. Richard
the Imp—the same young ’un that played the
romantic young scaler of walls in “ Fantasticks ”
—is an awfully good emotional mummer, and his
curious lisp helps in the boyish rdles, but he ought
to see to it that he hasn’t got adenoids or some
such. He appears to have a barricade in his
voice, and says“di” for “I,” and other of his
vowel sounds seem to butt against nasal or other
obstructions. The Austral Orchestral Society
treated the crowded house well, and the fund
ought to be materially fattened.
Education Minister Hogue and Mrs. Hogue,
Miss Margaret Harris and Mrs. Rutter were in
the appreciative audience.
Mr. J. M. A. Ilott, of Maoriland, has been in
Sydney for a space. This tall, clean-shaved
young man, with the nice ties and boots and well-
stored intellect, is the bridegroom-elect of Miss
Gertrude Kidman, eldest daughter of Cattle King
Sydney Kidman, of Australia generally. The
now engaged brace first met whilst Miss Kidman
was touring in Ward’s Own Country some three
Vears ago. She has more recently been a year
floating about European capitals, and the
fact that she might have paced the wedding march
With a peer had she chosen is too Well known to
call for excessive reiteration,
.The past week has been enlivened socially by
little else than Dreadnought matinees, Judging
from published figures, the entertainments don’t
appear to have been frantic financial successes.
1 hus the show at the Theatre Royal, which
over £2OO when in a replete state,
yielded, when confectionery and programme
moneys were deducted, but £125. And the other
houses told a like tale. Mrs. T. H. Kelly, an in-
defatigable worker and expert organiser, put her
back into the business right valorously. She is
the one woman in Sydney capable of galvanising
such functions into life. Yet they didn’t
galvanise worth mentioning. People who;
if Dreadnaughtiness is a sign of Imperial-
ism, should have been there, stayed away as
assiduously as those names one naturally looks for
on the Mayor’s Fund remain off it. The feeling
? n to the latter appears to be not so much
mdifferentism as anger. Everywhere, during the
past ten days, I have been meeting unlikely folks
—hardshell Empire Leaguers, Persons of the
.Bulldog Breed, and so forth —who become red
with passion at the least mention of the
Fund, and argue violently that something pain-
ful ought to be done to the originator of
it in recognition of his criminal folly in
bringing “disgrace on the State.” The one
cheering item that outstands from the whole
sorry business is Mr. Abbey Dangar’s recently
given assurance that in the likely event of the
Dreadnought Fund money being handed back to
as many of the donors as can be identified he
will give his promised £lO.OOO to the hospitals.
After all, ten thousand pounds expended in that
admirable fashion were ample compensation for a
little good-natured laughter, at our expense, from
the other States.
The late Mr. Ernest Favetic was elected in
London a F.R.G.S. on the lGtli of November, the
day of his funeral 1 As it chances, his Fellowship
holds good, although he is not here to be congratu-
lated on it.
At Paris House, Sydney, the sound of revelry,
like the brook, goes on for ever, but on Friday
night there was an extra bang in it when a large
number of the best people connected with the
printing industry foregathered to do honor to Mr.
Alexander Moir, a partner and director of the
firm of Morgan and Smith, hereinafter to be known
as Messrs. George Morgan and Co. Mr. Moir was
starting out for a holiday scamperthrough America
and Europe, and the company determined that he
should not go away empty. It has been said that
the British people have a genius for colonising;
but their greatest talent lies in the direction of
eating and having a good time. The feast at
Pans House was up to the best traditions of the
race. On Monday, feeling much set up by the food
he had received, Mr. Moir, accompanied by his
wife, got safely away in the Makura for Vancouver.
Among the departed trippers who left by the
India on Saturday last was Mrs. B. ]NT. Stcdman,
of Manly, and her two children. The lady’s des-
tination is Marseilles, in the south of France,
where the party will be met by Mrs. Stedtnan’s
parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Binns. late of Stan-
more. Mr. Binns is one of the partners in the
firm of Saxton and Binns, made famous through
Australasia and beyond it by the fact that the
other partner, Mr. Saxton, is owner of Sydney’s
fastest white-winged flyer, the beautiful yacht
Awanui. Mr. Binns’ taste runs to motors, and
from Marseilles the party will overland through
France per their own cars, one of which is an
enviable structure with sleeping apartments, and
generally fitted up like a luxurious yacht—only it
sails over the land. This is the ideal'way to travel.
All unheralded, from a social point of view, the
roller-skating season started in Sydney a few days
ago. Do those, I wonder, in our midst, who
delight to do things for the sole reason that they
are done in London, know that in that sombre
village roller-skating is the latest craze. To
Olympia, a huge barrack of a place in the
West Kensington district of London the whole
fashionable world repairs dailyjust now, and rolls'
like mad. Prince’s Club, the famous ice-skating
resort, is deserted. According to a London
paper:—
Bridge is in danger of losing its grip. The theatre is
threatened with partial desertion. The club is faced
with desolation. Instead of playing Bridge in the after-
noon, ladies are rinking at Olympia. Instead of yawning
over the papers at the club, the stalwarts of the Guards'
are adding strength to their muscles and grace to their
carriage by rinking at Olympia. Instead of making a
dash for Bond-street as soon as the House is closed, the
younger stockbrokers take a taxi to Olympia and join the
rinking throng.
Follows an imposing list of duchesses, mar-
chionesses, and countesses who rink; also, by way of
giving a final cachet of smartness to the new move-
ment, the news that “Mr. Tod Sloan, the world-
famed jockey, is to be seen rolling gracefully any
afternoon.” and likewise “all the most popular
musical comedy actresses of the day.”
Cartoonist Bengough cartooned Minister Hogue
on Saturday night as a lavish dispenser of schools.
Schools were pulled out of his pockets with the
prodigality of eggs or coins from a conjurer’s hat,
whilst the accused—l mean the cartooned —sat
blushing in a front seat. Another cartoon —one
body with the beads of Deakin, Lyne and Cook—
was agin the Government, whilst a strident voice
from the gallery said things about the. Beast
in Revelation, and assured “Alfred” that he
“ couldn’t do it.’
Soprano Rosina Buckman is one of the few
damsels who can wear a motor bonnet without
looking bold or old or just disastrous. The long-
faced or prominent-nosed girl mustn’t let that
garniture inside her house. But Rosina in her
dark green motor bonnet is quite an ornament to
the Bengough company.
The “ Englishman’s Home ” co. leaves on Thurs-
day for Melbourne, so the people of that wicked
city will soon know the joy of seeing the home
life of Myrtle Villa, and listening to Geoff
Smith’s recital of the wild jag on which he went
with another gay dog. It was a jag that lasted
from early one morning till long after midnight,
by which time “there wasn’t much chynge left
out of a sov.” Then there’s the shriek of the
shell. The shell has a speaking part. Meantime
the Ola Jane and Kolker pair of the co. are re-
hearsing another curtain-raiser, “The Queen’s
Messenger,” The present one is rather gruesome.
Oneof the most distanyu picture hats I’ve seen of
late is that worn by Mr. Bert Gilbert, when he
is masquerading as. a puffect lady in “Jack and
Jill.” It is black, with black plumes, has an arch
tilt at one side of the brim, and is gifted with a
coy depression at the other. It is really too smart
a hat to wear when you are saying nasty things
about the other woman. With a covering like
that on your peak of thought you would feel
kindly disposed towards all women, and would
merely remark that Mrs. Drink water is a very
worthy domestic Woman, but quite without taste
in hatting or fracking,
We have something to look forward to at the
next Royal Art Society’s show. Mr. Chung Ling
Soo, the juggler, has commissioned the miniature
portrait-painter, Miss Justine Kong Sing, to paint
his portrait.
Two actresses, well known to us by name, have
put up the bridal Song .of Thanksgiving. Ethel
Barrymore, of the U.S., married a Mr. Griswold
Colt, son of Colonel Pomeroy Colt, who is
described as a well-known Boston millionaire;
and Maudi Darrel, the English musical cornedy
artiste, wedded quietly at the end of March a
Scott sh landowner called lan Bullough. Mr.
Btillough is half-brother and heir of Sir John
Bullough, said to be the only young man of fashion
who ever voluntarily accepted a knighthood.
Most Australians ; who went Boer-baiting in
S’Africa ran across John Bullough. He was at
Capetown on his perfectly splendiferous yacht at
the time that the trouble commenced. When the
carnage began, and typiloid and enteric victims
were dotted all over the land, he transformed his
craft into a hospital ship, received the fallen
soldiers on board, and paid all exes, out of his own
capacious pocket. When the Government offered
him the same decoration it bestows on pro-
vincial mayors, a- shriek of amused ecstasy
soared up from his . friends. But, the y.oung
man accepted the gaud in a spirit of humorous
toleration ; and confounded gibers by point-
ing out to them that, in a sense, it placed
him in a very unique position indeed. The
prying chronicler mentions. that-. Miss - Darrel
registered her age as 26, and her bridegroom gave
his as 23. The lady changed,her name in a long
chinchilla coat worn over a silver grey skirt and
lace blouse.
From a friend in M.L. :
I supposed j'ou have heard that Melba says she lias dis-
covered a most wonderful contralto at Stewart Island in
the person of a Miss Thomson, daughter of the people
who keep the accommodation house at Half Moon Bar
Melba tried her voice at the urgent'request of a friend'
and told the reporters that it licks creation or bangs
Banagher, or words to that effect. Mr. Lemmone told
me that it is a marvellous voice in every way, a true con-
tralto of about 2£ octaves compass. Miss- Thomson is
about 22, pretty, and with a good stage presence; s 6 if
shehas brains in the same ratio as her other gifts she
ought to think herself very lucky Stewnrt Islander’
Ada Crossley, in fine voice, looking as fresh as a
spray of white hawthorn and robed, in ivory
eharmeuse, fulfilled her promised concert for
certain charities at the Town Hall on Saturday
night. Her freshness is remarked upon solely
because she had only arrived in Sydney from
Maitland less than two hours before the pro-
ceedings began. All the well-known music
lovers and a formidable contingent of music lovers
who are not known filled the hall, and the
charities will benefit by the sum of £2OO. Mayor,
Mayoress, Sonny Forster, and the Laytons were
amongst those on the sacred strip of carpet in the
forefront of the hall. The (Jrossley-Mueckes
leave for Adelaide on the road to England on
Thursday next.
In “Lucky Durham,” Miss Harvey, as Helen
Vallerton, is lucky in her hatting. 'One of her
head-suits is a large pale blue Ottoman hat
wreathed with pink roses, and sporting long
streamers. The second is pale pink, with a big
cluster of hand-made grapes. It is worn with a
pink linen suit. The third creation is a mushroom
shape of prunella tulle,.and is massed with violets
with one deep pink rose on the edge of the brim. ’
Concerning dances: I note that the Sword and
Rose Dances (at the return of the Crusaders) and
the Pyrrhic Dance may be acquired from a
recent! v-arrived teacher. They sound attractive.
Mrs. Malcolmson Boult, of the highly educated
feet, is the teacher. In partnership with Pro-
fessor Holst, of Leigh House, the lady will also
impart all society dances, stately old English and
French measures, as well as Russian, Hungarian,
Polish and Asiatic capers.
Subscriptions to the Hospice for the Dying sent
m response to something I wrote about the insti-
tution in a former letter stand as follows Mrs.
Mann, three guineas; a gentleman from Queens-
land, five pounds; a friend in Victoria, one
guinea; Mrs. Gibson, one guinea; a well-wisher
from Gunnedah, five pounds.
I’ve got a suggestion to offer the Dominion of
Maoriland. It will save the community two mil-
lions if accepted. Instead of giving two Dread-
noughts to Great Britain, let the Dominion give
one Dreadnought and Amy Bock.
A golden jubilee (which isn’t a very common
thing even among the long-lived Australian
people) was celebrated at “Berylea,” Forest
-Lodge, recently. The people accused of the deed
were Mr. and Mrs. William Shearsby. They
were married in 1859, at that very ancient fane,
St. James’ Church, by Rev. Robert Allwood, and
the pair have resided in Sydney ever since. The
husband arrived in Melbourne by the ship Ralph
Waller in March, 1855, and the wife was imported
with her parents in the ship Calcutta in 1838.
Maorilanders seem to be simpler folks than their
adroitness in luring loan money from abroad
would suggest. A few months ago a serving-
damsel turned up at a leading hotel in one of
Joseph Ward’s leading towns, and by the simple
process of signing herself Campbell-Bannerman
attracted to her the entire nobility for miles
round. They entertained her at dinners and
lunches, asked her to stay with them, and lent her
money. Ultimately she decamped, taking with
her much borrowed cash, and enough unliqui-
dated bills to burn down a city with.
Those who had entrusted her with good
red gold didn’t get it back; and the bilked
traders never connected with their goods or the
monetary equivalent thereof. Now another quaint
fakir has turned up. She also was a servant.
Being left alone in the house in which she served,
she took the occasion by the forelock and hypothe-
cated the furniture. With the coin so-raised she
entered upon a life of romance and mendacity.
Under t.he name of Percy Redwood, she wooed
and won a maiden in a far distant town, and actu-
ally married the girl before discovery came. She
got for her trouble free quarters, a quantity of
free food and liquid stimulus, much applause
and excitement and limelight, and, finally, that
wedding-scene which so appeals to the female
heart whether it happens to beat at the time
beneath a chiffon blouse or a fancy waistcoat. As
Amy has pleaded guilty to obtaining coin under
false pretences, it is likely that for some months,
(even —conceivably—years), she maybe prevented
from deceiving the credulous of M.L. When her
time is up she will—if she decides to stick to
a life of hood-winkery—assuredly recommence
operations at the old address. The Land of the
Moa is a gift and a blessingand a source of income
to such as she.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture of the most desirable Motor Tyres and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,” and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to tie certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, May 10, 1909.
My Dear Yarrie,—
A one-time glowing social light has dropped out
into the vasty darkness—dead Knight Graham
Berry’s widow. She was the second Mrs. Berry,
and took up the step-mother job when sjie
was not very much older than her youngest
step-daughter. She also introduced several very
pretty daughters into the world at a later date,
girls who had more than a soupqon of a leaning
stageward. One married a Melbourne journalist
of note, who migrated to Sydney, and she, after
a lengthy flutter on the boards, subsided into
sedate matrimony. A younger daughter, who
let off some of her yearnings in recitations and
private theatricals before getting an engagement
with the Nance O’Neil co., also dropped back
into quiet married life. One daughter married
medico Clarence Godfrey, and some small Godfreys
are perpetuating the Berry beauty. The second
choice of Graham Berry was a lovely woman in
her day, and a most charming hostess. Her happy
knack of getting just the right score to her cute
little dinners made her beloved of the social mas-
culine butterfly. After her husband’s death she
was left with little of the wherewithal for enter-
taining. The beggarly £5OO a year that was doled
out in pension to Grafter Graham was stopped at
his death, in spite of friendly petitions for its con-
tinuance to his widow. All she got from a bitterly
economical Government was an appointment as
registrar of births, deaths and marriages.
Kings are crowned and deposed in America, the
Presidential prestige glows and fades in the Yoo-
nited States, and the vast populace remarks
“Hurrah” with more or less.violence, yet the
atmosphere, here, across the Pacific, has not been
disturbed by so much as a flicker of a prawn’s
front tail. Uncle Samuel’s country is new—
though not so brand new as Us—but already it is
crusted with precedent and tradition. Mr. Taft,
succeeding Mr. Roosevelt, smashed a long-endur-
ing Constitutional habit at the first swoop.
Custom decreed that, while driving from White
House to the Capitol, the deposed President
should sit on the right hand in the open imposing
carriage with the incoming President on the left.
Then, on the drive from the Capitol back to
White House, the situation was reversed. Taft
broke the custom by leaving the deposed President
Roosevelt kicking his heels on the Capitol steps
while he (Taft) took his wife proudly
along. Mrs. Taft is the first woman to drive
thus to White House and take a consort’s place
in the regal procession. The incoming and out-
going President couplet has been the fashion ever
since the time of Washington, except that, when
Washington went in, there was no outgoer,
because George 111., who was the real departer,
refused all invitations to be present. Mrs. Taft
is a inuch-liked woman, very graceful and charm-
ing, and happily imbued with that necessary
virtue, tact. Another change in this coronation
was forced by the tempestuous whim of the
weather. The ceremony has been always put
through on a dais half way up the million Capitol
steps at Washington. Above and below and all
round surges the sea of populace. A blizzard of
horrible intensity rushed Washington on this day.
Roads were blocked, incoming trains were snow-
bound, and when they moved at all they were
only shoved along by the curses of the passengers
who couldn’t get to the show. Half the populace
of the States was swearing with vigor and freezing
bitterly miles away from the fair. The show
itself was forced off the platform, and the cere-
mony worked out in an inner Council Chamber.
The new President came forth immediately he
was materialised or new-born for the view of the
freezing, blown-about populace.
Mr. Taft, it seems, resigned his post one time
in his Secretary days. The resignation happened
four years ago, yet never a breath of it became
public (even in the eager wolfish press of the
States) until a month or so ago. Three men alone
knew of it—President Roosevelt, Secretary Taft,
and Cortelyou (the man who engineered the Taft
campaign). After a visit to the Philippines, Taft
suggested strongly and vigorously the establish-
ment of Freetrade between those islands and the
States in the matters of cotton and tobacco. This
view was considered disastrous by the Government.
Roosevelt wrote a private friendly letter—a tactful
intimation —to Taft that he was howling in an
unpleasing way, and barking up the wrong tree.
He was even told that he was chasing the wrong
rabbit. He was asked to please be quiet. Where-
upon Taft shooed his typewriters and assistants
out of his rooms, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and,
with his own bare, unaided hand, wrote six fools-
cap sheets of furious resignation. Roosevelt re-
ceived the screed, turned down the corner, and
scribbled, “ Dear Taft, Fiddle-de-dee.” Cortelyou
delivered the answer gently and smoothly, and
the war was declared off. That was four years
ago.
“Secretary,” in United States lingo, has the
same meaning as Australian “Minister.” Our
“Secretaries” are usually in a minor position to
Ministers. In Britain, however, they have Secre-
taries. Even Haldane is only Secretary for War,
which doesn’t sound much better than if he were
Clerk for Rows and Disturbances.
A cry against Taft used to be that he only used
youth—very young youth—for any work of his.
Strangely enough, the only Secretary he has re-
tained of the old Cabinet is Wilson, a grim, grey-
haired Scotchman frae Kilmar-r-nock.
The Hammond-Cleggs (or Ham-and-Eggs, in
the language of the irreverent) always pursue the
fashions with a brass band. Following the (for
once, sensible) idea of a cottage on the far sand-
fringe of the bay, the Ham-Eggs have a gorgeous
humpy at Sorrento. Its mock-mediaeval turrets
and its flag-flying in vice-regal splendor evoke
envious sneers from more modest land-crabs.
“Missus” is young and frockily girlish., and
gives her full-fledged daughters, ‘'Dollie'’ and
“ Billie,” long tethers. The girls prowl round
the beaches and the ti-tree scrub in the happy
freedom of Parisian gowns and hair dressed after
the fashion of the Queen of the May ; and alto-
gether show just how a sea-beach recreation laze
should, be befrilled. Having just returned from
abrawd, they ought to know.
“Sosso,” who got his poker length into em-
barrassing limelight in an almost forgotten divorce
imbroglio, has taken unto himself a wife. The
bride's sister. Miss Potter, made much journalis-
tic stir awhile ago by sueing a defaulting fiance
for fracture of promise.
Another of the Horsham Tom-Youngs tangles
her feet in the silken web. Miss Elsie Young had
scarcely thrown the last shoe after sister Mab and
her Healey husband before she had promised an-
other six-footer of a banking man the privilege of
settling her future millinery bills and being her
Permanent Car Fare. The maiden, hovvever, has
promised papa to let this year spin out before the
next marrying. Gillespie, who holds the wealth
of the Wiinmera natives in the hollow of his
hand, is the man who has annexed the Young
“ r|,/> ‘
A certain much-discussed and be-frocked
feminine, who had a well-known somebody in her
train, is departing. Her villa is to let. Every
woman in the suburb has been to inspect that
house, and came away bitterly disappointed at the
unsensational and tame look of the deserted estab-
lishment. Probably they expected to find gar-
goyles and Venuses gambolling in horrid clamor,
or a mysterious coulcur-de-rose tinting the atmo-
sphere. The only trace they found of a personal
touch was a small grave and exquisite miniature
tombstone erected to the memory of the dog Fluff.
At last the curious have ferreted out the iden-
tity of the anonymous donor who has figured con-
tinuously on musical lists all the winter. The
Unknown dashed off a trifling contribution of
£lOOO, and opened the subscription for a permanent
orchestra. Various distinguished people added
to the haul. Melba bought the brasses (normal
pitch). The Rumfords butted in before they left,
and Paderewski came up like a Trojan, whereas
Kubelik was tried and found wanting. Many
private musical enthusiasts have added their mite,
and things begin to look hummv for orchestral
matters in this city, but so far no one had found
the orginal donor. It appears he is one Lee—a
quiet, retiring, cultured man, who knows as much
about music as the Pleiades.
Shackleton’s Antarctic Expedition lecture at
the Town Hall panned out £407 odd for Mel-
bourne Hospital fund. And he 1 gave a second
lecture, mostly gratis, and the rest for charity,; at
the Glaciarium, where the views of illimitable
snow-topped ice seemed peculiarly appropriate.
Shackleton’s lecturing experiences hereabouts are
a satire on the results he achieved with a lecture
given for his own profit somewhere in England.
The profit turned out to be a loss. The hall cost
£5, and the attendance numbered 25 in the
shilling seats, but two members of the audience
were paid for by Mrs. Shackleton, so their
“bobs” didn’t count.
Shackleton gave an unrehearsed glimpse of him-
self as a commander at a Melbourne lecture.
“ Put on the next picture,” he dropped in a quiet
aside at a moment of hitch. He orated for a few
minutes to his audience and glanced at the sheet
—still vacant. “The next slide, please,” came in
calm, quiet aside, and then a further flow of talk.
Another glance at the sheet—still vacant. “ Put
on that picture ! ” barked Shackleton, in a voice
that made the whole hall jump. It was not loud,
—but its tense, terse strength was a quality
unique. The belated picture rushed on deck with
a terrified jerk, and Shackleton dropped back into
his usual attitude of calm.
Shackleton does not orate. He appeals to the
imagination by forceful suggestion. He is laconic
and dryly humorous. His talk brought up a
memory of Frank Norris’s book, “ A Man’s
Woman.” In all probability Norris, who was a
life-long invalid and just out of his twenties at
his death, had never seen the snow stretches
of Alaska ; but his pictures of North Land and the
grim eating up of endless snowy miles by
men and dogs are a biting, living reality.
Shackleton shows pictures of men pushing
through vast, white emptiness in a motor. In a
few years, when specially-prepared and chemi-
cally-warmed explorers flit over by airship and
descend on the spike of the South Pole, they will
look down in wonder at the places that the old foot
explorers crawled painfully over, covering the
ruggeds and depressions in a line like indefatigible
black ants.
Roy Redgrave, after his various dashes as
beauty man with the only Tittell, has at last
found his sphere, and King’s is suffering from
swelled head over the acquisition of its new lead-
ing man. Andersonia could scarcely have a more
ideal hero. Roy’s hair curls to a nicety, and he
was apparently born with patent leathers on his
ladylike feet. Just now he spends his spare time
posing for beauty photographs and doing “fancy
work.” This is no accident of genius. He
must have been specially created to look
lovely in bellowdrama. His hero instinct is
unerring. Whatever hard-worked coup any
other Outback on the boards manages to
pull off, Roy the hero appears, immaculate
and curled, on the instant, presses his hand
to his heart, and is It for the applause. Bert
Bailey, a tired bushman, is author of the bush-
ranging play co-author with Ironbark-Bill
Duggan, brother of Eugenie. Bailey owns the
dogs who do stage tricks and save the hero
from a burning grave. The leading dog even
has an understudy. Bailey has been for a
solid six months perfecting the star dog in
his part (he dashes down the chimney of a
locked hut, and bites through the bonds of his
fainting master). On the first night Star Dog got
stage fright—the yells from the gods and the
blazing lights knocked the poor dog mummer all to
pieces. Whiz came Understudy Dog from the
wings, leapt down the chimney, and bit the slip-
knots. At the critical moment (on the first night)
when Star Dog refused to act, Mrs. Bert Bailey,
who was sitting in the dress circle, burst into
tears. She is a pretty, very young matron, and had
been followingauthor-hubby’s anxietiesfor months,
and the anti climax was too much. There is special
cleverness in the training of these dogs. A real
trick dog show on a stage has the trainer along-
side with his will concentrated on his doggies.
Bailey has to leave his dogs to their own intelli-
gence. He is their master, but they have to make
a pseudo-master of the beauty hero while Bailey
looks to his own part. “Outback” has a
mummer horse added to its menagerie. Neddy
comes on alone, rushes to the hut door and noses
open the latch —pretty cute. It is not all beer
and skittles acting as impresario for four-legged
mummers. One night a stage hand hit a too
frolicsome dog on the nose. Yelp went the dog,
and dashed wildly for the stage door (at the
King’s, huge doors open back into a circular
lane) and was gone like a streak of lightning
back to his kennel in Fitzroy—just at his cue, too.
With the winter comes music, showered on
one’s devoted head among the soul-inspiring
draughts of a co-00-ld Town Hall. When some
genius of enterprise- builds a large, comfortable,
warm place for the perpetuation of melody he
won’t need to expend so much energy in adver-
tising his stars. The Mallinsons are the last
billed people, and Mrs. Mallinson’s delicate
and artistic recitals of sweet small songs
will be packed into the Masonic Hall. The
acoustics of this place are three different kinds
of shocking, and only suitable for the brassy
blaring of a band. Mrs. Mallinson, who was Mel-
bourne’s Mrs. Steinhauer before her marriage, is a
Dane and a most personal friend of Danish Queen
Alexandra of England. She sings in cosy inti-
macy to the Queen in her boudoir, therefore
is her position in London assured. It does
not need that to give her standing here.
Her last recitals in Melbourne were full of charm.
The only thing to cavil at was Too Much Mallin-
son. The lady sang only her husband’s songs,
and always to her husband’s accompaniment.
Mallinson’s songs are sad and weird, and are a
continuous sobbing of melody on one string, so
to speak. They made the last part of the pro-
gramme feel like the forced propping up of a
dripping wet blanket. Husband Mallinson put
his soul into the organ of a Melbourne church in
the earlier clays, when he carried olf Mrs.
Steinhauer. It is understood that the lady of the
duet will remain in Melbourne, and take up the
Jansen duties at the Conservator! nm what time the
Swedish lady is taking another fond look at her
native land and visiting the tomb of Charles XII.
Exiles do clan together. We are becoming
musically Swedish in correct Conservatoire circles.
Prof. Peterson’s dimpled little wife came from
the land where the sun does its all-night
stunt in shining, and folks from the icy North
collect round the Conservatoire like moths.
Laver, the beauty musician, with a soulful yearn
in his Mozart face and hair, perpetrates a concert
in the Town Hall on May 17, with the Car-
michaels holding up the red plush seats in the
front row. Brahms, Chopin, and Tschaikowsky (it
is easier to sneeze that composer than spell him)
are to be the warm-colored backbone of the pro-
gramme, with the icy proposition of a Beethoven
orchestral overture to prevent the backbone taking
fire. The scarlet-colored composers have their
outlet through Laver and the piano.
The Wilbur Wright airship that the Taits are
bringing to this eager land arrives at Fremantle
about the same time as Amy Castles. There is
some suggestion of the two combining and travel-
ling together from Fremantle on Current 54 x
Monsoon F., with all chiffon propellers a-waving.
In which case it’ll turn out as Castles in the air.
The Beauteous Porteous—he of the cherubic
face and silver hair—has deserted his post as
Mercury to the Taits. The Clarke-Meynell-Gunn
firm has annexed him. He tours Maoriland with
the “ ’Ooks of ’Olland.”
The ball that Mrs. Green and daughter Florrie
gave to their pupils at the Town Hall last Decem-
ber was worth £lOO to the charities, realised from
the sale of balcony tickets. The attraction of
these annual juvenile dancing displays seems to
increase, rather than diminish. Four Melbourne
institutions—the Foundling Hospital, the Homoeo-
pathic, St.- Vincent’s, and St. Hilda Jewish
Ladies’ Guild—divide the £lOO equally.
Mrs. Ann Neate, who had pushed her existence
three months over the century, died at South
Richmond the other day. She was born in Eng-
land on 4th February, 1709, and arrived in Aus-
tralia in 1856, landing at Portland with her hus-
band and six children. Up to three or four
months ago the old dame enjoyed excellent health.
She left 11 children, and almost a nation of other
descendants. Her youngest babe is now an infant
of 62. As a shining example to the modern
matron who alleges that maternity is an awful
strain on the constitution, Mrs. Ann Neate should
have a statue to her memory erected in the middle
of Collins-street. Her list of victories — i.e. , the
names and dates of the 11 children —should be
carved on the pedestal of the statue, each of the
11 being credited with her or his number of pro-
geny.
The mummers in Melbourne just how are
athletically inclined. The Princess’s people club
together to fence with the foil and bring gracious
lines into their figures. The Theatre Royalties
lean mostly to pugilistic seances, and King’s is
stark staring mad on cricket. It reminds one of a
story of Benson—F. R. Benson —that actor-
manager who tours the provinces in Fogland, but
never plays in London. The Benson people are a
happy family, and the hemales of the company
are cricket mad. They play cricket anywhere
and everywhere, and play Shakspeare mostly on
the boards. So it came to pass that Benson’s
London manager got a wire from the big man,
somewhere north:. “Send along good left-hand
bowler to play Mercutio.”
“ Rosna ” discourses in the picturesque city of
Adelaide :
Their Exes, have now had their patronage seized upon
by everybody and every body (prithee, mark the distinc-
tion !) in South Aus. They have opened and shut seasons
by the dozen, and sampled every brand of melody that
has been within oijr gates. They were on hand to wel-
come Lieutenant Shackleton on Saturday morn, and on
Monday eve her Ex. went along to view that goodly
institution, the Buxton Girls’ Club, where the working
girl can dwell in comfort for a few insignificant shekels a
week.
If you would be kind enough to speak to Pluvius in an
angry and authoritative manner, we should be greatly
obliged. Thrice hath he done his worst to wreck our win-
ter elo’ and worked grievous wrong upon us. For the first
day of the Cup meeting he wept copiously all the morn-
ing ; then, when the race-crowd emerged, thick-coated
and booted, be retired to sleep, and only let down another
gentle torrent or so on their millinery as they homeward
wended their profane way. But for Cup day he sur-
passed himself. He got in a fine, new set of deluges and
tipped them headlong over Morphettville, until the races
were aquatic sports, and the crowd had to swim about to
keep itself warm. Their Excellencies, like gallant souls,
were there both days. They came in their motor, and
were towed to the vice-regal box by. sundry aides and
things. Herself was decked out in a wondrous silky
mauve frock concealed beneath a long cloak. One of her
nice twin damsels was in pink cloth and some charming
brown millinery, and the other in a heliotrope confection,
with a flowery toque. There were other frocks, in spite
of Mr. J. Pluvius. Mrs. Dave Fulton was a dream in
black and white ; and Mrs. Clem Hill had a skirt of rather
large blue-and-white check, and a smart little, tight-
fitting blue coat. The Tom Barr Smiths had a tea, or a
luncheon, or some other variety of food and drink, and a
section of the partially-drowned populace foregathered
thereunto.
We have had Shackleton fever. The attack was sharp,
but the loss of life was not important. The Polar bearo
(I mean hero) came along and lectured to us at 35., 2s.
and Is. in the Elder Hall on Saturday and Monday, and
there wasn’t a spare seat on the countenance of the box
plan for days beforehand. What time Mr. Ramshackleton
wasn’t holding forth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, all
the learned professors in the State were standing round
with their alphabets trailing after them, and holding his
hand. But personally I regard him as an unsatisfactory
lion.- He didn’t emit one roar concerning the price of
sealskin jackets at the Polar Emporium, and he wouldn’t
say how high the Pole is, or how long it takes you to get
up it. We don’t even know whether it is greased or not.
Our Mayoral folk are going to repeat the great kiddies’
ball that was such a charming circumstance of last season.
The University ball warns the budding maiden to get
her frills and furbelows into training for the end of this
month. A whole procession of pretty girls threatens to
burst upon an under-manned and over-girled State on that
occasion.
There came home, the other morn, Mrs. Rasp, widow
of that fortunate Charles who once, on a lucky day, cut a
valuable slice out of Broken Hill. Mrs. Rasp has been
shaking hands with the ancient landmarks in her native
Kaiser-land,.along' with her sister, Miss Kleversahl. The
latter demoiselle has a g-ood voice, which was trained by
Marehesi herself.
We can now ride to Paradise by electric tram. The
glad fact was duly celebrated by an exciting ceremony on
Saturday, when banners waved, cars blossomed as the
rose, and Mr. Goodman wore his best Sunday clothes.
There is something beautifully indefinite about our
electric cars, by the way. If you board one in
North Adelaide to go to Kensington, you are
just as likely to land at Payneham or some
other locality more exciting than adjacent. The
conductors live in a thrilling atmosphere of uncertainty,
and, I understand, never know where they are going till
they get there. The car bloweth where it listeth.
And we are still having trouble over the subject of the
tram and train lines that disport themselves side by side
down King William-street south. The railway says it
will be jiggered (whatever that may be) if it will move to
South Terrace, and the Tramway Trust doesn’t care
much, anyway, and has offered to run on the footpaths,
or any old wav. And the smile of the undertaker is loud
in the land. Now a meeting has hurled itself bodily at
the authorities to ask them to push the railway off the
landscape, and what the outcome will be goodness knows.
“Braw Scotch nichts” are chronic in this locality at
present, owing to the presence of sundry large “Kilties,”
who are making music at the Exhibition. The first night
sundry local bands came out of their lairs to escort the
kilted ones on their perilous journey to the hall, and the
blare of the wild bagpipe was all over the land.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.

Nearly all cough medicines that are offered
for sale simply control the cough—that is all.
There is nothing healing about them. This is
where they differ so greatly from Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy. When the mucous lining of the
throat becomes congested, when the lining mem-
brane of the bronchial tube is inflamed, or when
the most delicate tissues of the lungs become
affected, then Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy
shows itself superior to all other medicines, be-
cause of its healing and strengthening properties.
Its power to control congestion and inflammation
puts it in a different list from any other cough
medicine. Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy soothes,
heals and strengthens. The cough disappears, for
the cause has been removed.*
IMPORTANT TO
DYSPEPTICS
The Right and Wrong Ways
of Treating Indigestion*
How One of the Worst Cases
of Indigestion on Record was
Cured.
The old way of treating stomach troubles was
to give the sufferer with indigestion something to
relieve the pain and to help digest the food.
But this never cured indigestion. It simply
couldn’t. The weak stomach of the dyspeptic
doesn’t need something to help it digest food. It
needs strength to'carry out the digestive processes
itself. That’s the point of curing indigestion.
Make the stomach strong enough to do its own
work. That is the Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills way.
The tonic treatment; with them restores all the
conditions for healthy digestion by furnishing the
stomach with an abundance of pure red blood
and sufficient nervous energy. As the processes
of digestion are controlled by the blood and nerves,
it necessarily follows that this treatment is direct
and certain in its action, and the stomach becomes
strong enough to do what it ought to do.
One of the worst cases of indigestion on record
is that of Mrs. M. J. Copes, 28 Carlton Street,
Chippendale, Sydney, who was cured by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. The following statement
made by Mrs. Copes to a reliable reporter will
bear the strictest investigation. She said :
“Some while ago I began to suffer with indi-
gestion. I had to be very careful of what I ate.
The least morsel would choke me and give a cold
feeling at the chest and between the shoulders. I
couldn’t touch boiled meat, it would have to be
grilled and very little at that. My head would
ache terribly, just across the forehead and over the
eyes. If I stooped I could hardly recover myself,
and every object would seem to be running round
me. I couldn’t do much reading or sewing, 'as
everything looked blurred. On a hot day I’d be
regularly done up. I’d feel too ill to look after
my housework. I was always languid. I got
washy looking and seemed to have no blood in
my face or hands or body. I felt thoroughly run
down and wretched in my spirits. Sometimes
I’d sleep very badly: and be drowsy all day. I
was suffering this way on and off for twelve
months at least. Then I read about Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills and decided to give them a trial. I was
rather discouraged with the first box, but the second
box made me a little better. The headaches got
less severe, and presently I felt a lot brighter and
more energetic. I began to eat fairly well, and be-
fore the fourth box was finished I was on the high-
way to a steady recovery. I could sleep well and
the color began to creep back to my face. Now my
health is very good.”
The price is 2s. fid. per box, 6boxes 15s. 3d., and
if you have trouble in getting them, send a postal
note for the amount to the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Co. of Australasia Ltd., Sydney, and they

POLITICAL POINTS
“ Harrison O.” writes :
In the report of Alfred Deakin’s recent Brisbane oration
the Melbourne Age described every interjector as a “dis-
loyal Socialist.” When Alfred was meandering: through
Fisher’s land-tax proposals without saying anything defi-
nite, a member of Che audience requested in a tired sort
of voice if he (Alf) would support Andy’s proposals for a
tax. This harmless person with a justifiable thirst for
information was dubbed “a disloyal Socialist.” When
Deakin touched on the Deadhorse myth and spoke of our
pride in the British navy, “vigorous dissent was ex-
pressed by the disloyal Socialists present.” This sort of
thing makes me tired. How did the Age’s “Special
Reporter ” know that the interjecters were Socialists ?
Was it because some of them had red hair? Is a man
who has red hair a Socialist ? Is a person who interjects
at a public meeting a Socialist ? Would such a person, if
he had the opportunity, lay despoiling hands upon the
Marriage Tie? Why is a man who does not believe in the
I'eadhorse myth a Socialist? Are all Socialists of necessity
disloyal? In what way are they disloyal? What’s the
matter with the Age, anyhow?
LEARNING THE NOBLE ART.
The Old Lady : “ What does a little fellow like
you want to bother about that for; and your
old father the champion of the world, too ? ”
Australia: “Now, stop your screeching; the old
man mightn’t always be champion, or he might
die , or I might grow up. So I’m going in
for a bit of the noble art.”
The trials of the men accused of breaking
the peace at Broken Hill have concluded, and a
Draconian Judge sitting at Albury (N.S.W.),
with a farmers’ jury to assist him, has handed out
sentences varying from one to three years. But
Tom Mann, the hired imported organiser—Tom
Mann, once of the Beer-and-Water" public-house
in England—has got off. The Manns of this
world—they of the Beer-and-Water public-house
—are marvellously ingenious at getting off while
other and better men fall in.
“ F.C.” writes :
Compare Britain's intentions for financing' her Dread-
noughts with the selfish proposals of some Australian
Jingoes. These latter first wanted to borrow the coin,
and then gradually liquidate the debt by duties on tea
and kerosene—taxes that wouldn’t affect their own class
to any special extent. Britain promises to double that
portion of its income tax that the essentially wealthy
man pays, to touch the motorist by a £25 registration fee
on top of a duty on petrol, and to tap the man of means
in a variety of other ways. Of course, it can’t get much
more out of the poorer classes—they haven’t got it—but
considering how often and unremittingly Britain dips a
hand into the Fat Man’s pocket, the wonder is that capi-
tal hasn’t been driven out of the Cold Country long ago.
The Murray Government’s commission of
inquiry into Bent’s land purchases begins to look
very bogus. It is now stated that the scope of
inquiry will be widened to include (at further ex-
pense in time and money) a lot of direct evidence
or hearsay allegations as to Bent’s private in-
terest in the matter of “ the WerribeePark Estate
purchased from Mr. Chirnside.” But rumor has
it that the Closer Settlement Board intends to
take all responsibility for the purchase of the
Chirnside property, which fact is well known to
the parties who profess to be bloodhounds on
Bent’s track. Moreover, it is understood that the
Werribee job hasn’t turned out to be a bad job
anyhow. It seems to be dragged in mainly as
whitewash for Thomas B.
On May 15, Theodore Bruce, ex-Mayor of
Adelaide, and a rank Conservative, will fight out
a contest with J. W. Styles, an ex-Methodist
parson, who is Labor candidate for the Upper
House seat vacated by Kirkpatrick, the new
Agent-General. Bruce is a member of the Tram-
way Trust, and Styles, besides being Mayor of
the democratic suburb of Thebarton, is secretary
of the Tramway Employees’ Union. In this con-
nection the struggle acquires fresh interest,
because the Trust compelled one of its drivers
(Leaves) to resign because he declined to withdraw
from the Thebarton Council, to which he had
been elected. At the last two by-elections for the
Central districts Labor candidates were elected.
This time a slump in the Labor vote is alleged,
but the fight is expected to be very even.
The type of person who, in the past, has
been wont to vote Ereetrade and Anti-Sosh with
much regularity has taken of late to vigorously
disowning one or both of his creeds between
whiles. Thus the S. M. Herald last week in-
advertently accused the N.S.W. Liberal and
Deform League of being Ereetrade. Back came
this heated repudiation (10/5/’O9) from the secretary
of the slandered institution :
In dealing with “Federal Parties—Prospects of Fusion ”
you say: “ There is the association known as the Liberal
and Reform League—Freetrade in its aims.” Now, this
is entirely incorrect. Freetrade is not, and never has
been, one of the aims of the Liberal and Reform Associa-
tion. The association is formed on an Anti-Socialistic
basis.
And Sydney Sunday Times’ special correspondent
in Melbourne delivered himself thuswise the dav
before J
Practically, we are all Socialists, more or less, and the
mistake of the Labor party is that it thinks it has got the
letters patent for all the Socialism the world knows. No
reasonable-minded person would oppose the Labor party
on mere Socialistic grounds.
The trouble with the Cook crowd is that it doesn’t
know for the life of it what grounds to oppose the
Labor crowd on. It fears for its political life to
be openly Foreign-trade; and its bogus Anti-
Sosh business has been seen through. It looks as
though the glad day will soon dawn on the
Commonwealth when a newspaper will be cast in
heavy damages for describing B. Smith as other
than a convinced Protectionist and a red-hot
Soshite.
“Dreadnoughter”: Apropos this Joe Cook-
B. Smith policy of buying defence from abroad, I
hereby rise to suggest: (1) That all Australian
police forces be summarily abolished, because they
are inefficient as compared with the London
.T. Dunns, and hence unnecessary and pregnant
with disloyalty and disaster to the Empire;
(2) that the Motherland be asked to police
Australia in return for an annual subsidy to
be paid the Commonwealth ; (3) this force
to be trained and controlled from Scotland
Yard, London, on the understanding that,
in the event of a rush of crime, to the
heart of theEmpiah, it may be withdrawn ;
(4) the prestige of the noble British John
who, for a hundred years has braved the
area and the cook, would have such a de-
terrent effect on Australian criminals that
but a small force would be required, and
would, of course, consist of old and worn-
out men, to match the blessed squadron.
P.S. —I do not want a title.
Somebody has found time to analyse the
proceedings before the special court which sat at
Tam worth (N.S.W.) to consider the Peel River
land resumptions. The witnesses were asked
over 50,000 questions and gave over 50,000 replies,
and they took 46 court days, or eight weeks, to
do it. Counsel spent 32 hours in addressing the
Judge, and if the ultimate result had been deter-
mined by averaging all the various valuations,
the decision would have been just as likely to give
satisfaction as was the actual verdict. It has
taken about 12 months to get as far as the case
has got, and it will be about another year before
the la id is cut up. At this rate the big landlords
of N. iW. will be dispossessed by 2000 a.d.
On May 12 the Price (S.A.) Government
attains the age of three years and 290 days—equal
to the term for which the Jenkins Government
existed. Now the only S.A. Ministry which ex-
ceeded it in length of days was that of
C. C. Kingston, which lived nearly 6£ years.
Price has the distinction of never having
had to face a no-confidence motion and
of never being without a substantial majority,
whereas Jenkins dragged on a precarious
existence amid much sorrow and tribulation, for
he was seldom more than one vote, and that a
very wobblesome vote, away from destruction.
Once he only escaped defeat because Livingstone,
now M.H.R., had given a pair in a division to the
whips of both sides, and so was not countable when
the critical time came. In those days, strange to
say, John Darling, of Broken Hill fame, was co-
operating with Tom Price in the endeavor to
shoot Jenkins out of office.
Some Yic. politicians—including an ex-
Premier (not Bent) and a member of the Murray
Ministry—are said to be interested in the local
scheme of storing wheat for famine prices, which
is being financed by a Melbourne bank.
A MISSIONARY JOKE .
I have recently visited China, and was astounded at
the progress made since my last visit. With their rapid
assimilation of European ideas and vast population they
threaten in time to swamp Asia and Europe. The only
way to prevent them leaving their country is to Christ-
ianise them. We must send out more missionaries.
China (receiving missionary and having learnt
his object): “A welly good joke. You welly
muchee make me laugh)’
Amazing outburst by Spruce Myth at a
recent Deadhorse meeting :
It was not England that wanted money—she could get
100 millions in the market to-morrow —why a Dread-
nought should be given but to show the world that if
Germany should attack England she attacked the British
Empire.
Said that Sydney Mayor Allen Taylor’s
Dreadnought disappointment was suggested to
him by a young man on one ot the dailies, who
now shudders every time he looks at the list, and
keeps out of the mayoral sight as much as possible.
“D.W.M.” : Apropos your leader (8/4/’O9)
on “The Eternal Trader,” the following from
Gardiner’s “ Outline of English History,” which
is the text-book at my small boy’s school, may be
of interest. It occurs in Chap. I. :
Then the Roman army went away. The Romans had
been attacked by their enemies, and they wanted their
soldiers to come home to defend Italy. The Britons were
left to take care of themselves. Unfortunately for them
the Romans had not taught them how to fight. They
and their fathers had lived so long in peace that they did
not know how to keep off an enemy. They were attacked
by wild and fierce tribes. .. . These ... came amongst the
Britons plundering and killing. The Britons had always
been defended by the Roman army, and, feeling quite
helpless, they wrote to the Roman General to bring his
soldiers back. The General did as he was asked ... and
then went away for ever. The Piets and Scots returned.
A people which cannot defend itself is likely to meet with
no mercy.
It is the sort of baldly tragic passage that is going
to be written about Australia in the near future,
if the Cook-Neild politicians who favor mer-
cenary-purchasing for an indefinite period get
their way.
Interesting item from the preface of the
volumes concerning Australasia in Stanford’s
“Compendium of Geography and Travel,” pub-
lished in 1907 by Edward Stanford, of Long Acre,
London, and written by J. W. Gregory, F.R.S.,
D.Se., and professor of geology in Glasgow
University :
Since Chapter I. was in print, there has been a marked
change in r.he British attitude towards Australian naval
policy. The view that Australia could give more
efficient aid to the Empire by developing her own navy
seems to be rapidly spreading in this country [Britain].
It has been supported, amongst others, by Lord Brassey,
Admiral Fitzgerald, and Mr. Richard Jebb. The more
sympathetic appreciation of the Australian attitude is the
more satisfactory, as discontent with the existing
arrangement seems to have been growing rapidly in
Australia. A formal guarantee that Australia would not
remain neutral should the United Kingdom be engaged in
war would probably remove many British objections to
the development of an independent Australian fleet; and
some of the critics of the British official view do not seem
to realise that Australia is under no constitutional neces-
sity to render assistance to the Empire in case of war.
J. M. Jolly, described as “a well-known
electrical engineer, connected with theconstruction
of the new Adelaide tramway system,” gave the
Anti-Sosh papers some information they didn’t
relish when they interviewed him, last week, on his
return to Australia after a six months’ tour of
Germany. Asked as to the march of Sosh in the
Kaiser’s dominions :
He said he was amazed at the grasp Socialism has on
Germany.
“ It is everywhere.” said Jolly, “and it is extend-
ing year by year.” And then, deliberately and
coldly, this professional man, who had had the
best of opportunities to learn the strength of the
subject he was discussing, delivered himself of
this heterodox statement:—
The workmen’s unions are wonderfully strong. They
have made Germany a paradise fur the working man.
Questioned regarding the Dreadnought move-
ment, he replied :
Among the deep-thinking people this agitation was re-
garded as merely political flapdoodle.
After which, presumably—though it is not re-
corded—the information-seeking reporter departed
and kicked himself thrice in an inaccessible spot.
A lot of the women who applied for elec-
toral rights at registrars’ offices in and about
Melbourne were seen to tear up the documents.
Being questioned, they said they had registered
their names, and didn’t want to be troubled with
“ a receipt.”
Victoria’s Minister of Water Supply,
Graham, is a sanguine person, with more faith in
his fellow-farmers than he has any justification
for. When Irrigation Expert Elwood Mead
returned from inspecting the Hunter and Lachlan
settlements in the Ma State, he told Graham that
about the only impression he had received was the
need for further increasing productivity under
irrigation in Victoria, particularly in the Northern
areas, where Graham and the Rodney farmers
belong. And Graham optimistically observed
that he “hoped ” that when the Eastern channels
were completed the said productivity would be
increased. Not a word about an irrigation rate
on the acreage served; nor about a tax on the
increased values given to the land by the State-
supplied water. Graham’s “ hopes ” are likely to
be as barren as the unused paddocks of the Rod-
ney “irrigationists,” or as Elwood Mead’s efforts
to get his bosses to inaugurate a real irrigation
policy.
Treasurer Twaddell hinted broadly at
Narrabri (N.S. W.) that the next estate that his
Government intends resuming is Killarney.
Killarney is a fertile and extensive tract of coun-
try which supports a good many thousand sheep,
and at the same time strangles the prosperity of
the entire surrounding district. It belongs to
Buchanan, the aged patriot who hurled a promise
of £lO,OOO into the Dreadnought hat last month
after dining at the Union Club. Buchanan’s
enthusiasm in the cause of Empire does not impel
him to voluntarily dispose of his huge mass of
earth. By waiting till the law forces him to
part with it, he will get a much better figure; and
though the Government pays the enhanced price in
the first instance, it gets it back ultimately from
the settler, so everyone—or nearly everyone—is
happy. Apropos the thought obtrudes itself that
Buchanan would have shown himself a better
Imperialist had he whole-heartedly taken £lO,OOO
off the agreed-upon value of Killarney and thrown
it open to the Empire’s sons on that basis. That
move might have been less spectacular than bang-
ing a promise on to a club dinner-table so that
every champagne bottle in a radius of 10 feet
leapt with startled admiration ; but it would have
been far more genuinely patriotic.
YELLOW FEET UPON THE ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Listen, O my brothers, to the whisper of the future ;
And shoulder manfully the white man’s load.
You can hear amid the laughter and the babble of your
cities
The sound of yellow feet upon the road !
Blue eyes, and grey eyes, our hearts their torches light-
ing.
Shall horror glare where only love-light glowed?
Are your sweethearts worth the winning, and their white
souls worth the keeping?
’Ware the slinking yellow feet upon the road !
’Tis a lotus-land for dreamers, of sun, and wine, and
honey.
’Twill be a bitter reaping we have sowed.
Cease the songs a moment, and listen, listen, listen !
To the sound of yellow feet upon the road.
When the pouring hordes from Asia strip the stricken
land before them !
When Hell is loose, its hoofs with murder shod !
The dead will then be blessed who lie s ghtless and un-
hearing ;
Spurned by the j'ellow feet upon the road.
Stricken streets and shambles, where only laughter eddied,
Blotted sands where spray'-soft beaches showed ;
Only shall .you meet them with hand upon the trigger—
Those shuffling yellow feet upon the road.
To-day is but a lost day; to-morrow leaps upon us.
Darker with each sun the years forbode.
O listen to the whisper and the menace of their coming—
Those hastening yellow feet upon the road.

POISONOUS HUMORS
In the Blood Overcome by Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills.
Mr. Thomas J. Cranwell, a young farmer, of
Rockbank, near Melbourne, writing from the
residence of his parents at Footscray, states how
blood poisoning set in his arm and extended all
over his body, which the doctor’s treatment failed
to counteract. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
however, afforded him speedy relief. The result
of the first bottle exceeded his most sanguine
anticipations. Read what he says:—
“It is a little over twelve months since I suf-
fered from hinvkl poisoning, the result of a cut on
I
Mi. .. -Ci-..iiwell.
(From a photo.)
the right arm, which I
neglected, and from the
arm it extended all over
my body. I was in a
dreadful state, and the
pain was intense. I was
under the' doctor for
months, but I did not
Seem to be progressing
under his treatment. At
length, seeing Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills
extensively advertised I
thought I would try
them, and procured a
bottle. The result of the
first bottle was beyond
my most sanguine ex-
pectations. I continued taking them until every
trace of the poison had disappeared, and now I
am healthy and in splendid condition to-day,
thanks to Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. I have
recommended them to all my friends, for I think
there is nothing like them, not only as a blood
purifier, but also as the best remedy for diseases
of the stomach and liver.”
As a perfect blood purifier, Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills have a world-wide reputation, and
thousands of instances are on record of their
efficacy to overcome blood disorders. Pimples,
boils, and blotches are minor forms of impure
blood, which, however, should not be neglected.
When the blood is in an unhealthy state, other
ailments are more or less present, for unless the
blood is . pure, it is lacking in that energy by
which the organs of the body perform their
functions.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The strenuousness of the struggles put up by
the Union Rugby crowd in Sydney this season has had
the effect of making a serious gap in the receipts of the
League. So far Union Rugby has far outclassed the game
of the League, notwithstanding the admirable exhibition
put up by the “ Kangaroos” (just returned from Britain)
when they walked over N.S.W. at the Agricultural
Ground. The contest between Glebe and Newtown, two
weeks ago, was a great sight, but it was eclipsed on
Saturday last by the sledge-hammer contest between
Glebe and University. In the words of the barracker,
Saturday’s match was a real blanky bonzerina—a boshter
of the most bonzer type. The gods in Olympus struggled
for the Uni., but the stars in their courses fought for Glebe,
and Glebe scrambled through—by one solitary point. But
what a struggle it was ! Uni. played the last of the game
with two men short and one very groggy. Had the blue-
and-gold team remained intact, the chances are that it
would have won ; for, although Glebe got the best of the
scoring, the advantage was most of the time on the side
of University. The record was six to five.
Like Glebe, South Sydney has won the first
three matches of the season, and begins to bulk big on
the horizon with six points to its credit in the competi-
tion On Saturday it fairly crushed Balmain in spite of a
vigorous resistance, in the course of which the scrunched
ones got off some really beautiful passing' rushes and
dribbling charges. It was sheer meat and bone and the
weight thereof that blew out the light of Balmain by 16
points to six. Manly received its first poke in the eye
this season, when St. George managed to down it by six
to five, after a rather spiritless game in which the Village
team did not play up to its previous standard and seemed
to forget its defence. Although no one expected the
Sydney crowd to bold its own against Eastern Suburbs,
not even the most virulent backer dreamed of it being
walloped by 18 points to five. This was a horrible down-
fall ; but, horrible as it was, it paled into insignificance
compared to the shocking way Newtown treated North
Sydney. The Premiers got North Sydney on the ground,
closed with it, broke it up, fell upon it, and then dragged
it round by the hair till time ran out, and the score stood
at 35 to six. Western Suburbs was out of the hurly-burly
with the bye and two certain competition points.
The result of the upheaval is the continuity of
Glebe and South Sydney in the front rank, with six com-
petition points each. Eastern Suburbs, Balmain, and
West are close up with four each ; while Newtown is
bracketed alongside Manly with three points. Univer-
sity, Sydney, and St. George have each a pair, while
North Sydney has a large, round, circular O to its credit.
In the Soccer division, Rozelle, the unbeaten,
is top dog with eight points, having walloped Garden
Island by six to two. It was the good order and dazzling
speed of the Rozelle forwards that withered up Garden
Island. Pyrmont, hitherto unbeaten, struck trouble on
Saturday, when it only succeeded in making- a draw with
Granville. The score was two goals each. This, of
course, gave Rozelle the lead by one point in the compe-
tition, and there is weeping and wailing and spitting of
curses out Pyrmont way. Although Glebe managed to
down Newtown by three goals to two, it is still suffering
from the effects of that previous defeat, and accompanies
Sydney and Ultimo in the third row with five competition
points. Balmain beat Sydney by one to nil, and Ultimo
and Western Suburbs played a scoreless draw. The
Powerful blotted out Northern Suburbs by three to
nothing.
The Westralian Soccer team was at Newcastle
on Saturday, where it got the hide walloped off it by the
Northern Union (Soccer), the home team winning by four
to nil. But it must be urged in mitigation that the
Westralians were too freshly off the sea and railway
journey to make a good showing. They will probably
exhibit better form at Sydney Cricket Ground on Satur-
day (15th).
* * * *
Rugby League prospects are not too bright
when a display by the returned Kangaroos against a team
representing N. S. Wales can draw only about 2000 people
on a perfect afternoon like that of l ist Saturday. In the
struggle to keep warm in the Cold Country, the Kan-
garoos developed remarkable celerity at getting off the
mark, and before the bulk of the home team realised that
the game had started, the returned contingenters had
scored 10 points. But when N.S.W. did wake up, it made
little difference ; the Kangaroo score just bounded up to
17 to nil. There'it froze until half-time. N.S.W. pulled
itself together at the resumption and came near to scor-
ing, but failed at the critical moment. The ’Roos began
to leap again. The home men were practically helpless,
and the ’Roos rushed the score up till it was 43 to nil. At
this stage they eased off, and apparently resolved that
the other fellows should get some points. The paralysed
Waters did not rise-to the occasion at all rapidly, but
before the day of grace expired they managed to score a
couple of goals, thus making the figures 43 to 10. As one
’Roo remarked, “ There was no blessed fun in it! ”
The Sydney Australian Rules footballers are still
suffering from inability to get grounds where they can
charge for admission, and thereby' get a little capital to
go on with. They have crowded houses, but as the shop-
keeper said of the push that had taken refuge in his door
from the rain, “there’s no money in it!” If the Aus-
tralian Leaguers could get some enclosed grounds to
play on the game would probably boom. The Y.M.C.A.
and Paddington clubs are showing splendid football,
which is about the best advertisement the game can get,
and the number of clubs is increasing steadily if slowly.
Y.M.C.A. downed Newtown on Saturday- in a manner
that gave the game a great lift among the spectators.
The combination was well nigh perfect, and the way the
whole team fed one man who happened to be in the right
position to score was wonderful to see. So was the score,
which finally stood at 88 to 13.
• * * »
In Melbourne on Saturday the bottom fell out
of the Tanks of God, so football was less scientific
than it might have been. About 16,000 spectators flopped
on to South’s ground to supervise the concussion between
“ Skinner’s hirelings ” and Carlton, which latter combin-
ation, smarting under its defeat by ’Varsity, was in no
humor to stand any nonsense. But the red-and-whites
were equally serious. Though the day and the ground
favored the lightweight Carlton forwards, they could
make no impression on the solid southern backs, and
the first quarter found their tally' but 13 points to
South’s 20. The other three terms were repetitions of
the first, save that the northerners got ever
further in arrears, and the play became ever more
sloppy and accidental, and when, at bell-ring, the
Carlton barraokers saw 28 to 45 on the board —against
them—they pondered in smothered rage on the unac-
countableness of things. Carlton encounters’Wood next
Saturday, and if it fails to emerge top dog, the barrackers
will certainly go dotty. Attracted by the certainty of
shelter from, the rain, an equally large crowd suffused the
Melbourne ground, where the Red Legs collided with the
“Same Old.” At half-time, the soaked Essendonians
swam off to their dressing-room with 39 points to their
credit, while the Melbourne 18 splashed through the pools
to their clubroom, 15 to the bad. After a change and
a wipe-down the locals bogged in as well as the mud
would let them and levelled the points to “40 all,” but
thereafter sank away into a slough of slippery hopeless-
ness. Essendon finished 20 points to the good—67 to 47.
’Woods visited St. Kilda and avenged last season’s unholy
walloping, though their lamentable kicking—3 goals 11
behinds to 3 goals 5 behinds—didn’t encourage them to
put on any side. The Magpies played no less than five
new men, and the result seems to have justified the
policy. Flushed with their Carlton victory and strength-
ened by their two best wing players the Students invited
Richmond to meet trouble on the claypan at East Mel-
bourne. The yellow-and-blacks came and left the
trouble behind them. From the bounce the fray
was uproarious, four players being temporarily laid out.
The disturbance was a furious and ill-regulated piling up
of minor casualties. ’Varsity, toiling in the rear through-
out the piece, only raised its supporters’ hopes for a brief
splash at lemon time. Richmond took victory home
with it by five points—42 to 37. Geelong came up to
’Rov and returned as usual, that is to say, ’Roy won by
88 to 28.
In Association matters, P’ran’s policy of attract-
ing League stars seems to be giving the usual return to
the man who splashes capital on his business —the first
fruits are early and showy, but there is no guarantee
about the later crop. Having thrashed the premiers,
’Scray, P’ran invited ’Town to come and get licked,
and ’Town came and got licked accordingly, though
P’ran’s margin—s 6 points to 52—wasn’t anything to crow
over. Brunswick spread itself —mostly in the mud—in a
vain effort to snatch the laurels or parsley or whatever it
is that ’Scray wears, the occurrence being enlivened by a
willing but untidy disagreement among the bar-
rackers. ’Scray finally accomplished 58 points to
Brunswick’s 50. ' The feat of the afternoon was performed
by Preston, which has acquired an ex-Collingwood
systematise and is being taught to play football in an
organised fashion. Right from the start the brick-builders
grabbed the lead, and stuck to it; and though the men
from the tramway suburb spread themselves recklessly in
the last quarter, the end of it all was, Preston 52 points,
Essendon 38. Brighton was at home to North, and after
a strenuous time managed to gain such credit as there
was in defeating that lamentable team, by 44 to 32. The
regrettable Ports welcomed Northcote to their abode,
and negligently totted up 12 whole points to ’Cote’s 36.
Then darkness and oblivion supervened.

One Cowell, a St. Kilda (Vic.) footballer,
created a pained impression recently when appealing to
the Vic. Football League against the refusal of the St.
Kilda Club to grant him a clearance that he might play
with Melbourne. He was discreet, and indulged in no
coarse accusations. He merely stated, when pressed for
his reasons for desiring to leave St. Kilda, that the club
was subject to strange fits of aberration, temporary
paralysis and peculiar play. He begged to be released
from such suspicious associates. The League retired for
meditation, and after much wrestling refused the appeal
and carefully announced that it had not been influenced
or impressed by the assertions of the appellant. In fact,
the League expressed its regret that Cowell “ had intro-
duced such matter into the inquiry ” ! None so blind, etc. !
* * * *
Sydney formed an Aerial League the other day,
with a view to fostering the study of the aeroplane pro-
blem. Exactly how the League intends to proceed is not
plain, for it certainly hasn’t got any money to burn, and
money is just the thing that is required. The great
trouble the inventor is up against is the question of how
to make his vessel rise in a business-like fashion. At
present all aeroplanes have to start by running some
distance along a road, or a railway track, or something,
in a horizontal direction. And that has got to be reme-
died. The successful aeroplane will rise perpendicularly,
and descend likewise. This point may make little differ-
ence as long as flying machines are small things made to
carry one man and a bottle of grog, or two men and a
decanter. But for real aerial navigation the ship that
has to slither along the face of the earth before taking to
its wings is an impossibility. Just try to imagine pro-
pelling an aerial craft the size of the Kyarra along the
surface of the ground to get its planes to exercise their
lifting power ; or, worse still, imagine that stately craft,
after having winged its way across from Westralia, finish-
ing up by running son e distance on the solid earth,
smashing trees, cottages, fences and cowsheds as it
goes. If the Aerial League can get hold of some money
with which to make experiments, it will find plenty of
bright young Australians who have been worrying at the
problem, and who have ideas, and ideas worth testing, on
this very phase of the matter.
* * * *
“ Vulcan ” : The pressing international problem
of how to comfortably smash t’other fellow from a bird’s-
eye elevation was seriously approached in Sydney re-
cently by the formation of an Aerial League with an
initial membership of 125. Primarily the League’s objects
are the study and dissemination of the latest aeronautic
information and the practical encouragement and trial of
local inventions in that line. Indirectly it will look after
Australia’s defence. The matter is a very pertinent and
far-reaching one for this country. Many scientific
authorities now agree that the evolution of the air
machine is swiftly discounting the modern battleship as
a defensive and offensive factor ; and some go so far as to
lay it down that, should the present progress in air-
ship improvement continue for the next year or
so, the most modern warship of to-day will be
dumped on to-morrow’s scrap-heap of oblivion beside
Nelson’s three-deckers, the muzzle-loader, and Troy’s
wooden nag-. Consider just what this Comparative per-
fection of the flying machine would mean to Australia.
Under such conditions, provided we kept abreast of them,
this country would enjoy absolute immunity from attack
in force. With the flying machine as the one effective
offensive weapon against a defensive one of similar kind,
our one risk, a few years hence, would be from an aerial
invasion ; but as our nearest possible enemy is over five
thousand miles away, this might comfortably be rele-
gated to the dim future. True, an invading force
by sea might carry such machines, but, in the
nature of things, the limit in this line would jbe
narrow indeed, and considering that, for the cost of our
just-ordered three torpedo destroyers, we could equip
ourselves with over 200 aeroplanes (which run to about
£lOOO each at present), such an attempt isn’t likely to be
undertaken, much less to succeed. As under these con-
ditions the present system of coastal defence (forts, guns,
etc.) will suddenly become'obsolete, the equivalent cost
of their expensive upkeep and renewal could, even on
present figures, be diverted to the building and equip-
ment of a cloud of 5000 or more aeroplanes. With such
an aerial host, swelled by a few thousands of privately-
owned sporting flyers, we could laugh at creation. That
Australia isn’t, necessarily behindhand in aeroplane evolu-
tion is proved by the fact that half a dozen machines at
least are awaiting the proposed Federal investigating
committees, and,that Maxim, the Wrights, Chanute, Prof.
Threlfall, and other flying experts agree that the present
aeroplane progress is solely due to the discovery of its
first principle in the box kite invented by* Laurence
Hargrave, of N.S.W:, a memberof the new league.
The above is worth printing as an interesting
opinion ; but this paper is very doubtful of the era of
peace being ushered in by the aeroplane. The thing is
in its infancy, but there are men in Australia who have
studied the matter and believe that, in the not very
distant future, aeroplanes of 2000 tons burthen will be
soaring through the air. It is merely a case of finding
the means of generating the power. The really heavier-
than-air skyship will not be driven by propellers. It will
travel by gravitation, rising to great heights and then
swooping down the side of an obtuse triangle. By
ah adjustment of planes it is possible to compel an aero-
plane to travel several miles while descending only a yard
or so when speed has once been got up. Under such con-
ditions the world would become a very small place indeed,
for 200 miles an hour would be a very moderate speed for
such a contrivance. The passengers will be inside, pro-
tected by steel walls from the torrent of air that will
stream over the shooting missile, and breathing, not the
outside atmosphere, but compressed air carried for the
journey. Sydney to Melbourne in two and a half hours
will probably be considered a nice, easy journey within
the next 50 years. Then, of course, Berlin will be only
three days’ journey from Sydney—which fact will bring
a lot of unpleasant possibilities in its train.

The baulking, falling, and running off of' all
starters in recent Steeple at Warrnambool (Vic.) has
parallels. At Flemington once each one of six starters
struck trouble, but one—Castanos —succeeded in a second
effort, and finished alone. Same course saw Schoolboy
the only one of a field of ten to pass the judge, and,
strahgeiy enough, at a subsequent meeting at Mary-
borough Schoolboy got round where his eight opponents
failed. Nineteen years ago, at Randwick, every nag in
the race mulled things, but Grafton and Reubenwere re-
mounted and finished as named.

Owner of Lutteur 111., winner of latest English
Grand National Steeplers identical with “Jim’’Cognac
Brandy Hennessy, who toured Australia a few years ago.
He made backing horses profitable—mostly through sheer
luck —while here, and took a couple of Australian nags
home with him. He is particularly successful in lepping
races, and was fifth among last year’s French winners,
with £10,150 ; this a-top of £3983 secured on the flat.
Lutteur was bred by M. Gaston Dreyfus.

That famous M.L. sire. Nelson, died the other
day, aged 28. Nelson in his time secured many big prizes,
among them three successive Auckland Cups, and, during
a visit to Australia he won V.R.C. Essendori and All-Aged
Stakes, and finished second to Trident in the Australian
Cup and to Abercorn in the Champion Race. The dead
nag was by King Cole from My Idea. He sired many big
winners—among them Sea Horse.

Someone having time and patience, which might
have been put to better use, has gone into the matter,
and announces that Grafton’s progeny have so far this
season gathered 139 races, worth £20,000 ; thus again is
top place among sires this year assured for Grafton.
Backers of the elusive racing quadruped col-
lected a little of their own from Patrick Moses at War-
wick Farm, on Saturday, when Ryde, Storey, Grist, Wee
Laddie and Blue Book shaped as their form at recent
Randwick meetings promised. Warwick Farm course —
with its long straights at the back and the finish—gives a
good horse a chance ; but there is yet a big surplus to
pull up. Some Moseses are already on their way to
England “for a trip,” and several others contemplate
following almost immediately. Your layer of the odds
never goes so far afield holiday-making unless he has had
a particularly rich haul.
Adelaide’s Cup wetk took a lot of Victorian
and Westralian sportsmen, with a very occasional Sydney
visitor, over to the Morphettville course. It was, on the
whole, a bad time for backers ; but with the tote, a loser
always has the satisfaction of feeling that his friends get
the money, even if he doesn’t. The chief feature of the
sport was the success of.local owners of good repute, who
race for the fun of the thing. These are more numerous
in S.A. now than at any previous time for the last 30
years, and they are having a good innings. The Good-
wood Handicap was a fine win for“ J. Rowen’s ” True Scot.
The weight (9st. 101 b.) was a record for the event, and the
time (lmin. 14 3-ssec. for-six furlongs) was only a fraction
of a second outside record. Dividend £6 45., and Edward
Simms’, Glucose paid £ll odd for being second. In the
S.A. Stakes (for two-year-olds) Balmoral bowled over the
highly-fancied Glenfalloch, and then in the Leger R.
Hawker’s Tiercel, with 4 to 1 laid on him, went down
before an up-country colt previously winner of nothing
better than a maiden race. Finally, in the one weighi-
for-age race of the week, Dr. Bennett’s Waipuna, a
.Maoriland purchase, beat the much-boomed Trafalgar,
and paid a £l4dividend. So- Waipuna became favorite
for the Cup, though Moorhouse’s Willy Wally had also a
late run in the market. Kooringa scored a highly-popu-
lar, but quite unexpected, win for S. J. Jacobs, paying
£lB odd, and the Willy Wally people got their money
back. In fact, the most striking feature of Cup day was
that all the six events paid a dividend, on the second
horse, of the invested pound and a trifle of silver over as
consolation. If the horse that finished fourth in the Cup
had been first instead, the dividend would have been £2OO.

The return of Wright and Alexander, the
Yankee reps, who failed to win the Davis Cup in Aus-
tralia last year, gave the American Lawn Tennis an
opportunity to blow off its spare liver. The paper
doesn’t screech that the Yankee players didn’t get a fair
deal ; but it gets badly bushed over the alleged “ terrific
heat ” during the progress of the tournament. A sample :
“ It was so hot that to sit in the sun for any length of
time was to get scorched, and it was not safe to carry
matches or other inflammables on one’s person ! ” The
general remarks of the returned wanderers are that in
future struggles for the mug they will be absent; and
they opine that Australia will hold the trophy for quite
a long time.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union made a great fuss
over the opening of the season on Saturday, and knocked
the University undergrads’ foolishness right out in the
first round. Shackleton’s Nimrod rolled over the dusty
billows between Sydney and Coogee, followed by
penguins, sailors and alleged Esquimaux dogs, all riding
on wheels. A representation of a Dreadnought jeeringly
inquired if the beholder had paid up. Napoleon flirted
with the Duchess of Dantzic while dodging the bill for
the laundry work on his trousers. A hideous rabble of
assorted nations and communities howled their various
jargons while they rode over the dusty ways to Coogee,
till at last they ran into a shower of rain, and then—what
a scatter ! But it was all for the best ; the 300 who con-
tinued on to Coogee had all the more to eat.

The Australian XI. made a very encouraging
start on English soil by wiping out Nottingham by an
innings and six runs. Evidently some of them can play
as well as growl.

“ Adelaide” : Can any faith be placed in stage
wrestling challenges? Probably not; and yet if the
young German, Willie.Kopich, who was strangled by the
Jap jiu-jitsu expert at Adelaide Tivoli the other evening,
did not long for gore, and come within half an inch of
borrowing it from his late opponent’s nose—well, he must
be a very fine actor. Allerdale Grainger, a former Agent-
General for S.A., was referee, and, being slow in giving a
decision, utterly failed to hold the angry house, which
did not understand that the strangle-hold is allowed in
the barbaric Jap game. (In fact, as The Bulletin hassaid
once for all, it includes all those tricks which Man agreed
to drop about the same time that he came down from the
trees and began to walk upright.) Illogical, like all
angry crowds, the gallery yelled to the conscientious
referee, “ You ought to be .yellow yourself! ” The tension
was relieved by a larger German, who announced that he
would take on the Jap himself, with no holds barred.
(Loud and prolonged cheering.) This ensured another
big house for next evening, but the crowd saw little. The
lfbstone expert-at-the-game got the 14-stone fair-wrestler
where he wanted him in about two minutes, and started
to screw his head off, till he acknowledged defeat. There
was a new referee. He had not Grainger’s oratory. “ The
professor has carried out the undertaking what he under-
took,” was his verdict.

A dull, slow, stodgy fight of 20 rounds was put
up when Tommy Jones, of Sydney, met Frank Thorn,
champ, feather, at Melbourne Athletic Pavilion, the other
night. The fight consisted mainly of reiterated tired
assaults by Thorn, and prompt, if nervous, responses by
Jones. Jones simply poked out his left like a pot-stick
or a tent stake or any similar hard, inanimate object,
and stopped the assailant, with his nose in sudden contact
with the wooden duke or mauley. Thorn, who is a tough
and active combatant when at his best, was at his lowest
and slackest on this occasion, and about as interesting as
a wet-day funeral. When the pair had revolved slowly
for 60 minutes, the referee started out of his long reverie,
and declared it was Jones’s on points. Possibly it was,
but both deserved the hoarse bellow of public disapproval.
The fight was all the duller for the fact that a brace of
unknowns, Green and Melrose, had just fought 10 rounds
of swift and brilliant stoush.

The language that Dibbs used over Chicago has
been eclipsed by the virulence of the remarks that
feather-weight bruiser Thorn used about Melbourne. He
hasn’t damned it—he has done worse, and accused it of
unfairness, petty spite, uncharitableness, and the spitting
habit. Thorn was eminently dissatisfied with the referee
at the Athletic Pavilion, who, he says, continually
cautioned him without stating whaffor, and created an
impression in the pugilistic mind that if he hit the
opponent he would be disqualified for life.. Writer didn’t
see the scrap, and cannot therefore say anything about
it ; but he does know from bitter experience that fight-
ing gentlemen are a very touchy lot. Bruising does not
make the moral epidermis thick.

Briefly, Catarrh is inflammation of the lining membrane
of the nose and adjoining passives. It the inflammation is
not arrested it invades the ears, throat and lungs, destroys
the senses of taste and smell; impairs the sight and hear.ng ;
causes baldness and rots away the frontal bones of the skull.
Dyspepsia and Consumption can also be direct y traced as
starting from the catarrhal discharges. The Ramey Medi-
cator is designed to treat the affected parts by direct applica-
tion. By its use, medicated air is slowly forced through the
nostrils and head ai.d into the lungs. Our iuhalent is a disin-
fectant containing carbolic acid, Dong-stand, ng cases of
Catarrh, Deafness, Headache, Asthma; Neuralgia, Coughs,
Bronchitis, Colds, I.a Grippe, etc., yield readily to the hea.-
ing properties of our treatment. It kills the germs and re-
stores normal conditions. \lt is a well-known fact that our
method of treating catarrh and kindred ailments is endorsed
by thousands who have used it. Why p.y a >pecialist a large
sum of m ney for doubtful resuits when you can cure yourself
by this simple home treatment? The Ramey Medicator is

CLOSER SETTLEMENT ACT.
Peel River
TAMWORTH a A
district, bstate
THE part of the Peel River Estate, recently
resumed by the State Government, has been
subdivided into
232 Farms.
Of these, 213 farms will become available for
application on
7th June, 1909,
under the provisions of the Closer Settlement
Acts, and the remaining 19 farms on
14th June, 1909.
The farms available on 7th June range in area
from 133 g acres to 1280 acres, and in value from
£1299 19s. 9d. to £3376 Bs. 2d. The remaining 19
small farms are situated within from 2J to
miles from Tamworth, and range in area from 3
acres to 8 .acres 2 roods 30 perches, and in value
from £3O to £7B 3s. 9d.
Full particulars and directions for applying,
together with Lithographs and descriptions of
the various farms, may be obtained free of cost on
application, by post or otherwise, to any Crown
Land Agent in New South Wales, or the Infor-
mation Bureau, Department of Lands, Sydney.
The area available is situated in the Tamworth
Land District, on the south-western bank of the
Peel River, and is distant from two to 20 miles
from the important and rising town of Tamworth,
which has a population of about 9000 within a
radius of five miles from its centre. Tamworth is
situated on the Great Northern Railway Line, 282
miles from Sydney. Newcastle, which is the
nearest seaport, is on the same line of rail-
way, 178 miles distant from Tamworth. The
Great Northern Railway Line passes through the
Estate for four miles, and the line from Tamworth
to Manilla traverses the northern part for about
nine miles. Gidley Platform is situated on the
northern part of the Settlement Purchase Area,
and Duri Siding on the southern portion.
The average rainfall at Tamworth is about 27
inches. A permanent water supply is provided
by the Peel River, to which the area has a front-
age of about 16 miles ; there are also numerous
creeks and watercourses intersecting the Estate,
as well as a number of permanent watefholes. In
addition, water can be obtained by sinking and by
conservation in tanks and dams.
The climate is good and very healthy.
The great bulk of the land is level and undulat-
ing, and is from 1240 feet to 1550 feet above sea
level; the remainder is hilly and mountainous,
rising to a height of 2400 feet.
The land offers opportunities to every class of
farmer. It is suitable for grazing and mixed
farming. The principal uses to whichitmay. be
put are the cultivation of cereals (particularly
wheat), breeding and fattening of sheep and cattle,
pig and poultry farming, and dairying. Parts of
the Estate are also eminently suited for lucerne
growing.
Terms: 5 per cent, deposit; balance (including
principal and interest at 4 per cent.) in annual
payments of 5 per cent., spread over a period of
38 years.
Persons who lodge applications for any of the
farms referred to herein will be allowed a refund
of half the rail fare paid by them on their visit of
inspection, and on any journeys they may require
to make to appear before the Land Board in con-
nection with their application. Successful appli-
cants. their families, and such belongings, includ-
ing live stock as were in their possession
immediately prior to the making of the applica-
tion for land, will be carried at half rates, provided
that, in the case of live stock, it lie not more than
sufficient for the land acquired. Persons desirous
of obtaining concessions in respect of railway
fares may obtain a form from any Crown
Land Agent in the State, which must be given to
the Railway Station-master when obtaining a
ticket, or, if unable to obtain a form, must ask the
Railway Station-master to take their name and
address, amount paid, and number of ticket.

ACETYLCNC BICYCLE LAMPFORS/ii
Guaranteed Equal to any Higher-Priced Lamp Sold.
WE have not the slightest hesitation in recommend-
ing this WONDERFULLY CHEAP ACETY-
LENE GAS BICYCLE LAMP to ALL CYCLISTS
Since their introduction thousands have beeri sold, not
fine of the purchasers being dissatisfied. The prin-
ciple is the same as the higher-priced Lamps ; the
water is stored in the upper chamber, and is turned
on to connect with the Carbide chamber by means of
the distribution pipe by turning on the water regula-
ting valve at the top. Special attention has been de-
voted in the manufacture to ensure the most essential
feature in Acetylene Gas Lamps, namely, that there
is; NO LEAKAGE. In this respect our Lamp is far
away superior to the large number on the market,
which allow 1 some of the gas to escape, consequently
are more bother than they are worth, and of no prac-
tical use whatever. Our ACETYLENE GAS LAMPS
have all the good features you could desire in a Bi-
cycle Lamp--fitted with Reflector ; very massive look-
ing ; and most heautitully finished and HIGHLY
NICKELLED. Honestly worth 15/- We guarantee
every Lamp, and, further, will refund amount in full
if any purchaser is not in every way satisfied (an re-
ceipt of the Lamp. If you want a good, strong, reli-
able Lamp at a reasonable price, sit down right now

Non-legal folk who were present in the
Perth (W.A.) Criminal Court, t’other day, felt
quite queer about the head when Justice Rooth
asserted that he did not know that a copy of the
Kalgoorie Miner before him was a copy of the
paper aforesaid. The judicial position taken up
was that a copy of a paper cannot purport to be a
copy of a paper until the editor or other respon-
sible person is dragged before the Court to prove
it. Which suggests all kinds of weird possibilities.
Presumably in his Honor’s mind a sky can only
purport to be a sky when the Creator, or other
responsible person, has been subpoenaed and has
sworn to its authenticity. But, of course, in a
case like that, his Honor could get no proof, and
would have to be content with the miserable
doubt that it might not be a sky at all, but an
elephant or a side of mutton. Life surely cannot
be worth living under such conditions. A steam-
roller might be a wind-storm, a lead-pencil might
be mixed bathing, and so forth and so on.
A Melbourne divorce case, tried last week,
suggests that lovely woman is none the better for
being married very young. A glassblower, with
a verra Scottish name, testified that he took his
Eliza to wife when she was a girl of 15, and he a
boy of 18. During the honeymoon the bride
stayed out all night for the alleged purpose of
nursing a sick friend, and the habit of nursing
unknown friends and coming home with the
milk seems to have grown on her. But there
were nights when she came home to late supper.
On one of these occasions she brought two strange
men with her, apologising for her husband’s pre-
sence when he tried to stop the intruders. Hubby
was merely a person who “was living there,” she
said, so the two gentlemen brushed him aside and
took possession of the house. Next morning the
glassblower lost his wife for good. She removed
herself to a larger house (in Lonsdale-street),
where some other ladies are living, and where
gentlemen can call in for supper free from moles-
tation by unexpected husbands.
A bonus on fruitfulness, in the shape of a
remission of income-tax to fathers of families, has
always been a favorite idea of Premier Murray, of
Victoria. Usually the idea has showed no pro-
mise of blossoming into law, possibly because it
was rooted in poor soil; but of late it has been
developing somewhat, and threatens to bear fruit
any day. Premier Jack Murray will drag his idea
under the notice of his Cabinet at an early date—
that is, if he can drag himself to drag it. Of late
Murray has been showing signs of great ex-
haustion, and his dragging power has been
limited.

Business, Robbery, etc.
A number of years ago the Independent Order
of Foresters came here from Canada to do life insurance
business. It charged very low rates, but it reserved the
right to raise its rates at any time it pleased, and so the
person who insured with it because it charged less than
the Australian offices was liable to suddenly find himself
charged a lot more than any’ Australian office would
dream of asking. And if that event happened he
must pay the extortion or else lose his policy and all the
money he had parted with in the past, for the 1.0. F. gave
no surrender values whatever. Thus the very low rate
was liable, unless the insured person made great haste
and died, to prove a gold-brick and a confidence trick,
likewise a spring gun and a man-trap. The balance-sheet
showed that the amount of the policies issued was not so
very- far short of that for which the A.M.P. was then
liable, while the assets were a mere fraction of those
which the A.M.P. then .held. This Canadian institu-
tion advertised largely, and it seemed to expect
first-class notices in return for its advertisements.
In quite a number of cases it got first-class notices, and
the manner in which it roped in sundry politicians of the
day and used them for advertising purposes was a
lamentable affair. The Bulletin was the first Australian
paper to denounce the 1.0. F. root and branch, and the
astonished manner in which a certain clerkly person
pointed out that, considering the' ailvt. the concern had
sent down, this treatment wasn’t the sort of thing: the
1.0. F. expected, was an interesting' business. The 1.0. F.,
though it really travelled on aslight variation of the utterly-
busted assessment system, professed enormous,sc,orn for
what it called the “ old line” offices, sucli as the A.M.P.,
and explained with a pitying smile that hostile criticism
was engineered by the “old line” offices out of bitter
and uncontrollable jealousy. It had a Red Indian
with a name like Ornithorhyncus as general manager at
headquarters, and it got lengthy accounts into some
foolish papers about his towering stature, his command-
ing eye, his high forehead, and the magnificence of his
chest measurement. Presumably, these were paid for.
It sent out an overbearing and ill-tempered manager or
representative of some sort; also a little, round, fat,
plausible Canadian individual, who seemed to be advance
agent or supercargo or scene-shifter to the institution, or
something like that. It l.eld meetings, and'got orators
to deliver speeches about it, just as any other cheap-jack
business might do, and;there are rumors that it even had
a magic lantern on the premises. In fact, it was a sort of
H iring apple-stall with a,blazing torch at each, corner as
compared with its steady, business-like rivals. '
Some of the Australian States had laws whereby
a new life insurance concern had to deposit a fairly large
sum with the Government before it started to do busi-
ness. These States have at lease a shred of security
for the policyholders’ money, but not enough to
make very much difference. New South Wales had no
such law. But it had the assurances of the overbearing
and ill-tempered person, and the little round, fat, affable
wanderer who was here to-day and gone to-morrow, and
the Red Indian in Canada, and a lot of other function-
aries that (1) the chief Australian office of the 1.0. F.
would be in Sydney ; (2) that Australian moneys paid to
the Order would never be removed from Australia ; (3)
that all claims would be paid in Australia without refer-
ence to Canada ; and (4) that the Order would never quit
Australia, but would stay and grow and flourish here like
a green bay tree, and be a continuous shade to policy-
holders.
Of course the wretched concern broke all these
promises. It has gone away and taken the money of the
foolish N.S.W. insurers along with it. When a policy-
holder dies—well, Canada is a distant place for a poor
and probably ignorant widow to collect money from.
And if the 1.0. F. says briefly that the policy has been
forfeited, or says that there isn’t enough proof of death,
or proof of identity, or proof of claim ; or if it simply
refuses to pay, or neglects to even answer the applica-
tion, what then ? The chance of a poor widow getting by
sea to Vancouver, and all the way by rail thence to
Toronto, and then supporting herself there for perhaps
six months while she conducts heavy law proceedings foi
the recovery of her money, isn’t any chance worth men-
tioning. The man who was foolish enough to put his
money in the 1.0. F. deserved to lose it, but it is rough on
his widow. The legal system which permitted the 1.0. F.
to pervade this country was a disgrace to the States
which were responsible in the first place, and to the
Commonwealth which was responsible in the second
place.
This isn’t the first case in which the foolish
Australian has trusted his money to the foreign life
office. And of the foreign life offices which have taken
his money—to quote only a few cases—the Eagle is gone
away, so is the Scottish Metropolitan, likewise the
Equitable and the 1.0. F. And when a foreign concern
goes away it may leave an agent to pay claims, or it may
simply tell the widow to walk to Toronto or New York or
London or Edinburgh.for her money. The unwisdom of
dealing with branches of remote offices while there are
big safe Australian concerns available is a very great
folly indeed.
Watson’s Bay’s great struggle to attract Sydney
visitors to its sand and rocks took the form of a wild-beast
show over half a century ago. That was long before
Sydney Zoo was started. The menagerie was near where
the obelisk now stands, at the back of the old Jack
Robertson property, and for a while it was a great draw.
The owner of the menagerie, one Billan, died and left the
speculation to his widow. She found the business
unmanageable, and not being able to dispose of the
animals she poisoned them, and sent the skins to Sydney
Museum. She had one tame lion cub, which used to
gambol about the rocks, but the local dogs conspired
against it and wiped it out.

BEALE Grand Prix PIANOS.
« ■'.. >• ■'•■ y-
ii V 3% l.' * -1;:}8 - . . -.
The following Awards were made to the Beale Pianos at the Franco-British
Exhibition, 1908 :
GRAND PRIX
FOR TONAL QUALITIES AND GENERAL EXCELLENCE.
A piano must, first and foremost, be a MUSICAL Instrument; that is, it must have a resonant, clear, sustaining tone of the first quality,
ihis award, then, particularly emphasises that point—it is “for TONAL QUALITIES and General Excellence.”
THREE GOLD MEDALS:
ONE GOLD MEDAL FOR EXCELLENCE OF CABINET WORK. After tone, the next essential in a Piano is durable and handsome
ca met work. You want your Piano to be a handsome piece of furniture, in addition to being a first-rate musical instrument.
MEDAL EOR IRON AND STEEL WORK. A considerable amount of iron and steel goes into the construction of a Piano,
nt le eale Grand Prix Pianos we use our own patent steel tuning system, which is immensely superior to the wooden system of imported pianos.
ONE GOLD MEDAL EOR FACTORY ORGANISATION. Necessarily, high-grade goods can only be turned out of well-equipped, well-
organise actones ; and the award of a gold medal for our factory organisation signifies that in this respect also we are in the very front rank.
A large number of other piano-makers competed, including the oldest and best British and French houses.
These awards cover every essential point in a piano, and in each case Beale and Co. secured the HIGHEST award. Remember that there were
no less than four separate juries concerned in these decisions, and after them the Grand Jury. It would be impossible to have better proof of the
exceptional quality of the Beale Pianos. In addition, eminent artists and composers inspected with great interest, and tested our horizontal and
upright pianos. Every one of them expressed high satisfaction.
We make all parts of our pianos in our own factories, thus having complete control throughout of the quality of the materials and workmanship
and saving many profits. n
BEALE PIANOS ARE GUARANTEED FOR 25 YEARS.

The MULTIPLYING and VANISHING BILLIARD BALL TRICK.
UNIQUE BILLIARD BALL.
By far the best, and most effective billiard
ball trick ever invented. This is a superior
method to any other billiard ball trick ever
yet performed. The pecularity of it is that
the balls can be given for examination as
they are produced, to show they are solid.
The performer having turned up his sleeves
and shown his hands empty, gives a minia-
ture billiard ball, about one inch in diame-
ter, for examination. The audience being
satisfied, he takes it in his left hand and
passing his right hand over it shows two.
Again a mystic pass, and there are three,
which he shows are quite solid. The audi-
ence now see, to their astonishmet, four
balls. These gradually vanish one after the
other, till there is only one left, which is
again passed round for examination. An
adequate description cannot be given of this
most delightful effect. If is one of the
prettiest little sleights seen for a long time.
The billiard ball set is made in *• ivorine,”
and can be made in any size. The illustra-
tion will give our customers some idea of
the efiect that can he obtained with this complete set. The sleeves are turned
back whilst performing- this trick the whole time, the hands shown empty, and
at any minute, whilst the trick is being performed, the balls can he passed for
inspection.
This trick requires no sleight of hand, and can be performed by any person.
The balls can be made to multiply or vanish at the will of the operator.

The Edison Amberol Records
Are Ready NOW!
THIS is another wonderful thing brought about by Thomas
A. Edison—the world-famed inventor of the Edison
Phonographs. Having brought his Phonograph to a
point where not even the most critical could ask for improve-
ment, he multiplied its entertaining ability by two. He
produced what is now called the Amberol Record, which plays
twice as long as the old style. The size of the record is
unaffected, and there is no diminution of the pure rich tone
which lovers of music so appreciate.
The AMBEROL Records
play for four minutes, and this fact enables us to offer numerous
selections that would have been spoiled by cutting down.
Amberol Records can be played on any Edison Phonograph
except the “ Gem.” All that is necessary are two simple
attachments, the prices of which are as follows :
For In Australia In New Zealand
The Records will cost 2/- each in Australia, and 2/6 in New Zealand.
Now that the new Horn Equipment is in vogue, the Edison
Phonograph is perfect, and r.aiders with a delightful accuracy
each light and shade imparted by the maker of the record.
Call on your nearest dealer to-day. He will gladly let
you hear the new records, and supply you with a detailed list
of the seventy Amberol Records now available. Write us if
you do not know a dealer.

A Splendid HEALTH 8 PLEASURE TRIP
BEAUTIFUL SCENERY.
CAIRNS is an ideal resort for the
invalid, for the tourist, and pleasure-
seeker* Australia has not any winter
trip to compare with it* The round
trip from Melbourne to Cairns and
back can be done in 27 days, Sydney
to Cairns and back in 20 days, Bris-
bane to Cairns and back in 14 day's*
The Red Bluff, Cairns Railway, North Queensland.
IT is a generally admitted fact that what
is known as the North Queensland Win-
ter Tour takes a high place in the regard
of the traveller. And justly so. Pos-
sibly in no tour in or around any portion of
the Australian continent are there such
opportunities for recuperation and rest.
They that have already accomplished the
tour have returned and have spoken—and
they have spoken in no mean voice. What
they have seen they have described fittingly
and without embellishment. They have left
their records of balmy days passed in
luxuriant ease upon the deck of a steamer ;
they have excited their less fortunate
brethren by descriptions that seem fabulous
distortions. Yet their statements bear the
impress of truth.
Now, allied to Queensland’s natural
beauties, and its wealth of mineral riches,
is its increasing tourist traffic, more especi-
ally that from the southern capitals along
the coast to Cairns or Cooktown. It may be
said that this traffic, already of considerable
advantage to the state more immediately
conce. nod, owes much of its growing influ-
ence to the admirable facilities provided in
travelling by the within-mentioned Steam-
ship Companies, whose vessels, all fitted with
the comforts and conveniences that people
have learned to look for in the best hotels,
have inspired a totality of regard for their
safety and general excellence that is scarcely
exceeded in any other part of the world.
In the first place, the tour opens up to the
inquiring visitor a country that is climati-
cally unfamiliar to the Southerner. While
in Victoria, for instance, one experi-
ences the variations in temperate condi-
tions to which one is accustomed, in Northern
Queensland one is transported to the novel
charm and delight of the tropics, with their
luxuriant vegetable arborescent growths.
Here, where flowers and trees owe much of
their vitality to unremitting care and atten-
tion, there they flourish in untrained and
unassisted grandeur. Here, where at this
season of the year the sky may be overcast
and the days be grey and sunless, there they
are revelling in tropical sunshine from blue
skies flecked with scarcely a cloud for days
on end. Here, where our nights may be
chilly and unappealing, there they are
pleasantly cool and have all the seductive-
ness of a dream. The contrasts are legion
and interesting ; but the significance of that
remark will only be appreciated by the
northward-bouqd tourist. That fortunate in-
dividual steps on board one of the steamers at,
say, Melbourne, and about 10 or 12 days
afterwards is breathing the bracing atmo-
sphere of Cairns, while enjoying to the full
the inestimable scenic resorts of the sur-
rounding country. Yet, the passage up is
itself by no means the least of the attrac-
tions ; for to laze upon a steamer for 10 or
12 days, and just eat and sleep and talk—
indeed, submit to a glorious indolence amid
the ever-changing effects of sea and sky—
has its appeal for all. In truth, the trip is
not too long to be monotonous, especially as
the frequent ports of call along the route
provide opportunities for little jaunts ashore
to view some of the chief objects of interest
in the neighborhood. Neither is the trip
too short to prevent the formation of those
little shipboard friendships ; the exchange
of views and opinions ; and the arrangement
of pleasant little parties for all manner of
excursions. In fact, this side of the question
is of no inappreciable importance. One con-
sorts with one’s fellow-men without the re-
straints to intercourse that are rigorously
regarded in the cities; one acquires the
knowledge that Australia is not one’s native
State, but a great island continent, waiting
to be explored and to be understood. That
inexpressible parochialism that comes from
long residence in a spot; that instinctive
narrowness that is bred by an unchang-
ing environment; each ceases to be—
each is scarified out of the being, so to speak,
by the influence of travel. The parochialist
becomes a patriot, almost a cosmopolitan ;
the Victorian, the Queenslander, the Wes-
tralian, each representative of his State, with
his State’s characteristics full upon him, loses
his title and becomes an Australian. On
such a trip as this, one mingles with the
other ; one sees in the other much to admire,
much to interest, much to respect—the bar-
riers of foolish misconceptions and mis-
beliefs are down. The fact that these ex-
tensive trips further the great ideals of
national amity and unity is not the smallest
recommendation of the North Queensland
Winter Tour.
It is after the steamer leaves Brisbane,
and heads northwards, that the traveller
enters the ocean within the Great Barrier
Reef, and, amid placid seas and bright tropi-
cal sunshine, passes for a few days an envi-
able existence that is all too short. Ever
and anon a bold, rugged headland grows
from an indefinite blur ; assumes shape and
color ; then glides past, to be succeeded by
long stretches of glittering white beaches,
backed by verdure-clad slopes. Again,
numberless islands complete a succession of
marine pictures, scarcely excelled in pictu-
resqueness in any part of Australasia, if in
the world. And, as the steamer ploughs its
way ever northward, the traveller maybe
reflects that it is well to be alive
and possess faculties sound enough to
appreciate such delights. Eventually,
of course, he disembarks, regretfully retro-
spective on the charm of the last few days,
perhaps even ready to assert that the steamer
has been over hasty in its passage. But
this feeling soon disappears as he becomes
acquainted with the beauties tropical
Queensland has to offer. Here is a land
that is, in some ways, ineffably strange.
Here he sees, growing in tropical profusion,
the fruits that he is accustomed to purchase
in the shops of southern cities; here is
the home of the banana and the pineapple ;
here are thousands and thousands of
acres of sugarcane under cultivation by
stalwart white Australians. Here is tropical
Queensland as it is. Watered by broad
and plentiful water-courses; indubitably
wealthy in timber and mineral resources ;
unsurpassed in climate at this season of the
year; magnificent in its abundance of moun-
tain and river scenery, it supplies to the
jaded visitor a northern Paradise and a
refuge for health, rest, and recreation.
Tropical Queensla d—indeed much of
Queensland that is not strictly tropical—
must be seen to be realised as a potent
factor in the growth of the national life.
Cairns is picturesquely situated, has a
healthy climate, and the temperature in
winter seldom falls below 50°. Good accom-
modation can be obtained at a reasonable
tariff, and the fishing is excellent. A trip to
the Barron Falls, and gorgeous scenery
about that part of North Queensland,
should not be missed.

IN BANANALAND
A Brisbane correspondent writes :
There died last week Dr. John Thomson, P.M.0., of
Queensland. “Jock” Thomson, as most of his friends
called him, was a well-known figure here. Bluff and
grim, he qould be a good friend as well as a very rampant
foe. His association with military matters dated into the
back of beyond, and in his way he did much to encourage
the youthful. Australian to prepare for the good fight.
The deceased.piedico was also a leading light in scientific
affairs, and the Royal Geographical Society had in him a
valuable friend;
He married Miss Mowbray, the daughter of one of
Queensland’s first lire escapes, and leaves a family of
three—Mrs. Ricardo (widow of Percy of that ilk), Dr.
Jean, and Dr. Jack Mowbray Thomson. The funeral was
a big gathering of soldiers, sailors and citizens, most of
whom genuinely sorrowed for the old chief. Jock was
by no means as old as he looked, passing in his checks at
merely 62. It is said that his motor had much to do with
the nervous collapse that finally developed fatal complica-
tions. Deceased was a son of J. Thomson, M.D., surgeon
and botanist. He graduated at Edinburgh, and came to
Brisbane in ’75. He was President of the Medical Board
and about a dozen other concerns of a like nature.
The recently-deceased Speaker Janny
Leahy wasn’t nearly as wealthy as was generally
thought. He left £11,704 behind him. Still very
few politicians leave even one-tenth as much.
For persistency and unwearying serious-
ness the Public Bun should be awarded to one
John Memonitch, of Queensland. John cherishes
an idea that the Queensland Government is in-
debted to him for certain exploratory and mine-
prospecting services, and each year he forwards a
gradually expanding bill to the Federal Prime
Minister, with a request that that individual will
use his influence to get the matter settled. John’s
claim now amounts to £11,724,678 4s. 10d., cover-
ing remuneration for certain alleged gold dis-
coveries, interest on the value of all minerals
produced in Bananaland for nearly 50 years,
travelling expenses and sundries. Failing pay-
ment in 14 days, John will take proceedings, or
beer, or something. There ought to be some con-
sideration for a fanatic of this calibre. If he is
a bore, he is at least a mammoth bore. In fact,
he is almost an artesian bore.
One time Charters Towers was the scent-
bottle of the North —the scent-bottle and guano
bag and bone dust depdt and broken-down
garbage cart, and all the rest. Now the smell
belt goes to Townsville, the place where Robert
Philp spent so much borrowed money as
some payment for his seat. The sanitary
depdt at Rose Bay is an unspeakable hot-bed of
typhoid. Recently the whole of Bishop
Frodsham’s family and household were down
simultaneously with the disease. The three-
quarter mile space between this evil spot and the
centre of the town has not been without cases for
ever so long. A town that would return a dis-
credited politician of the Philp order, and a
harmless back-number like old man Hanran,
might be expected never to wake up ; but this is
not so. The councillors have revolted against
their municipal smell, and have decided to make
of their dead aroma a stepping stone to higher
things. In fact they have resolved to buy a
garbage destructor, and the first thing they should
burn therein is Philp’s political reputation.
CASUAL ALGY.
ALGY : “ Poor old Bert, he’s dead. I attended, his funeral in 1900.”
HENNY “No, no—that was his Wedding.”
ALGY : “Bless my soul, you don’t say? But it’s quite probable. I paid very little attention to
what the clergyman was saying.”
Brisbane got something like a reminder of
the old Kanaka-importing times the other day,
when the steamer Van Spilbergen, from Batavia,
called in with 200 Javanese and Malay coolies en
route for New Caledonia, where they are to work
on certain coffee plantations belonging to one
Bowden. Brisbane felt sort of thankful that its
days of importing cheap discolored labor were
gone—at least, most of Brisbane did.
The Queensland Women’s Electoral League,
a Tory hen political organisation, is fighting shy
of the People’s Progressive League, which is the
Kilp-Phidston affair. At a meeting called in
South Brisbane, the other night, to form a branch
of the new concern, a prominent hen said that the
crowd to which she belonged wasn’t going to
allow itself to be swallowed by the P.P.L.
What with people writing to the papers to say
they don’t belong to the new affair, and people
writing to say they wouldn’t be seen dead with it,
and other people saying they don’t think much of
it, the offspring of Kilp and Phidston seems
likely to fill an early grave.
Between Mount Perry, in the Upper Bur-
nett, Bananaland, and New Rawbelle there is,
according to Digby Denham, an area of country
equal in size and richness to the Darling Downs.
In a journey through it of 216 miles he only saw
25 people ! It is fit for close settlement, but the
squatters hold it all now. Not for nothing, of
course; they’re too honest and patriotic for that.
So they generously pay rent at the rate of per
acre, and in some parts they go as high as l|d.
Nevertheless they’ll have to make room for people
when the State gets a move on it and builds the
necessary railway, and cuts up the land to make
room for population.
The Relic.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PLAIN fare enough the Diggers’ Arms
Provides its guests at Poppet Head.
There now drowse arid cattle farms
On sites where once the wine ran red
To ardent dreams of golden streams,
Whereto the feet of men were led.
Above the gable of the door
An ancient lamp swings to and fro—
A beacon on a friendly shore
To call down where the miners go ;
But now no wight comes through the night—
They mine in spheres beyond its glow.
Yet there I foupd, beside the bgr,
An old and crusted relic sat;
His aged eyes, on scenes afar,
Smouldered beneath his worn felt hat,
As lonely here he drank his beer.
And brooded in his beard, and spat.
He did not quickly condescend
To drink with me in friendly way ;
His ponderings of doleful trend
Were harping on a former day ;
And when at last he spoke, the past
Imbued his pessimistic lay.
“ The world,” he grumbled to his beer,
“ Has gone to glory hereabout.
Brisbane has growed, or so I hear.
But all the country’s petered out.
It’s lost the lead and run to seed —
And won’t recover, I misdoubt.
“ The bloomin’ land ’as gone to pot!
Men nowadays is merely weeds
Who don’t know ’arf what we’ve forgot,
An’ modern mates is broken reeds.
The rotten show ’ad got to go
When minin’ duffered on the leads.
“ ’Ere, in this pub of Bill Malone’s,
I’ve seen the bar all chock-a-block—
Macs footin’ it to bagpipe drones, ~
An’ Pats an’ Cousin Jacks a-floclc ;
All full o’ glee an’ spendin’ free,
An’ never carin’ what’s o’clock.
“ But now look round ye, an’ ye’ll see
Only a bagman or the like ;
They’re startled if a crowd of three
Inside these same old doors should hike—
Some silly clown comes up from town
With san’widge basket and a bike.
“ Aye, them was days. They’ll come no more l
The country’s on the downward grade.
It’s worse than in the time’s afore
The find o’ gold its prospecks made ;
They’ve gone their ways, the rousin’ days,

I felt decadent, small and mean.
Judging his ancient throat was dry,
I called the freckled pewter-queen,
That she might pass another glass
Of good she-oak to damp his spleen.
Trusting his pessimistic vein
Would mellow in his cups, thereat
I left the rest-house of the plain
Wherein the crusted relic sat;
Though still forlorn, his eyes of scorn
Smouldered beneath the worn felt hat.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP-
Brisbane, May 8, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The tourist season has commenced, and on
Thursday five vessels deposited 700 passengers in
our midst. They were bound north, to the land
of brightness and warmth, where the Children of
the Sun hang out. The town looked for 24 hours
like a personally misconducted Cook’s tour.
No one talks of anything but rowing just now.
Crews of Herculean oarsmenswarm the streets and
make merry on every hand. And the girls are all
wearing blue, and training hard in their little
tubs, and booking dances by the dozen for next
week’s balls, after the inter-State eight contest.
Those who don’t talk sport discourse scandal,
and the topic of the hour is the alleged indiscre-
tions of a legal light and his latest goddess—bar
one. And when Hebe’s bones are picked bare and
the legal light’s brief is torn to ruins, the talk veers
to the case of a certain Benedict who has allegedly
succumbed to the charms of a dainty little beauty,
and deals with the report that the beauty has two
husbands already.
The greatest and most, brilliant vice-regal event
that Brisbane has ever seen is over, the thousand
and one lanterns that twinkled like glow worms
in the gardens are extinguished, the turkeys and
hams are merely skeletons, the tents have been
folded, the garlands and the staghorns and the
flowers have faded, and the 1250 feet that trod the
slippery floors or the carefully garnished gravel
are resting after their labors, and their owners are
telling each other how plain their very dearest
enemy looked. The gown chosen by her Ex. was
a trail of white satin, upon which some lovely lace
and a suspicion of shell pink were cunningly
blended. The prettiest of the 16 debutantes was
Miss Sydney Jones, a particularly graceful miss,
who fluffed in a white charmeuse frock and carried
a sheaf of . lilies. Misses Flowep and H. Love
were a creditable pair of runners-up, while among
the common or garden lot, Mrs. Tyson Donnoly
in chene silk, and Mrs. Arthur Feez in a confec-
tion of begonia satin over a flimsy Frenchy lace
robe, about took the tea cake.
Following close upon the heels of the ragging
incident, when a local naval enthusiast was perse-
cuted by a senior Government official, comes an-
other unpleasant story of the Service. This time
it is our old friend the money-lender who is in-
volved. He is said to have a little business
arrangement with a potentate of a certain depart-
ment, which arrangement stands him in good
stead. On pay-day he may be seen laden with a
heavy brief bag, into which he has just dropped
his spoils. The modus operandi is described as
being very simple, and merely consists of a sud-
denly deferred treasury, with the result that the
entangled father of a family with rent coming
due has to raise the wind somehow. And the
cormorant’s luck in being on hand just when there
is a chance to do business is said to be marvellous.
His feet are unbeautiful on the stairs, but they
are very regular there. This isn’t a joke, or any-
thing like that, and in all earnestness I commend
the matter to the attention of the Cabinet. I’ll
guarantee that, if it takes the trouble to look into
things, it will find in certain quarters a most
curious record of irregular pay-days.
Manager Simonson, of the Bland Holt co., was
the victim of a painful accident on Thursday. He
went up to the gallery to quell an uproar, and
amid the vicissitudes of the fray that he found in
progress he was thrown down and had his knee
injured.
On Friday evening there was a great and glori-
ous gathering at the Johnsonian Club to bid fare-
well to their departing Exes. In the matter of
decorations, supper and music little was left to be
desired, and there was a sound of revelry
that revelled into the hours that are sacred
to the burglar and the belated cat. By
a strange coincidence, the guestess of the
evening, Lady Chelmsford, hostess Lukin
,and songstress fyjtewy. Narelle all appeared
wrapped in palest 'mff sjitin charmeuse. But
the singer aforesaUrAKs;d'in the matter of shine,
with a blazing bolero and front panel of steel and
silver. The vice-regal diamonds included the
famous stars and the collar. Mr. F. A. Watson,
lately with the J.C.W. co., sang sweetly, but the
fact that Dr. W. S. Byrne (who plays Chopin as
few can play him) was put down for a humorous
musical sketch was a poor compliment to the
musical taste of the guests. Miss Chubb, who
was to have warbled, didn’t ; but Miss Hilda
Roberts tickled the piano to some purpose.
Oh, friend of my heart, are you strong ? Can
you bear a shock? Well then, know that our
cricket representative, Roger Hartigan, has no
more right to his first name than you or I. In
reality, he is just plain “ Michael Joseph,” as any
other Irishman might be. Only he early dis-
covered the importance of not being Mike, and
covered it up. No mere “Michael Joseph ” could
ever have forced his way into an international
team.
On Saturday afternoon all the world and his
wife—and friend—visited Government House
and drank tea, and ate ice-creams on the
gravel, shook hands with the Governor in his
grey clothes and hat, and her Ex. in a cham-
pagne confection and a grey top thatch, and
generally whiled the hours away. It was an ideal
day, and every one had a cheery “ don’t-care-a
damn-if-the-wife-does-see-me air, that was quite
engaging. Harrie Higginson (just home from
Sydney), Mrs. Gilbert Wilson (fresh from her
triumphs with the Toowoomba Liedertafel), and
Miss Evelyn Newton (just off to marry her naval
commander) held little receptions of their own.
Mrs. William Collins, of Mudoombah, is visiting
Sydney this week, awaiting the arrival from
Maoriland of her mother, Mrs. Fitzhardinge
Roberts.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
“ Old Pirate ” : It is about time that Cap-
tain J. B. Robertson got his biography written
up. He is a seventy-four, and still in ship-shape
condition. Despite his 60 years at sea, he is hale
and hearty, and the people of the North and
those who drift round the coasts of Papua know
him as well as the folk of Brisbane know their
unlovely G-.P.0. He can tell you all about black-
birdingin the days when that enlightening business
was carried out with an axe in one hand and a
curse in the other. The late Earl of Pembroke—
he who helped to write the travels of “ The Earl
and the Doctor ” —might have sat at his feet and
learned wrinkles about South Sea Bubbles, not to
mention the Brown Girls of the same South Seas.
Just for a spell he went ashore and did what
soldiering was to be done in Maoriland be-
tween ’64 and ’74, and stuck his anchor
into many obstreperous natives. Then lie went
to Fiji, clothed with some sort of brief naval
authority, and incidentally repatriated about 1000
natives of what was then the benighted land of
Papua. These staggered brethren had been taken
away from their homes for their souls’ good by
beneficent persons whose ways couldn’t bear care-
ful police-court inspection. Of later years he has
been labor-recruiting in the same parts, but under
different conditions; for it is understood that the
strenuous days, when the recruiter simply sur-
rounded his nigger and took him away by the
hair, are quite dead and gone. Now old Captain
Robertson has gone to England on a visit to the
King and other friends.
“ Qg ” : “ Vigilans’ ” remark re the native
Queenslanders rooted objection to farming (B.
22/4/ 09) holds good in other places besides Tiaro, and
is easily explainable. Youmayobservethetendency
on all sides. It only exists among the sons of the
original selectors who took slices of land out of
the big leases. These men stocked as many cattle
as they could on their own country, and their
surplus ran free of charge on the stations. Their
sons were brought up from their earliest days to
“muster,” “cut out,” and ride anything with
four legs. Now the leases are falling due, and the
country is being cut up and taken possession of by
farmers from other States and from other parts of
Queensland. The natives, who could steer a horse
over any part of their district in the darkest night,
find farming tame after the eventful life they have
led. I know a case where a man of this class took
up a selection recently, fenced it in, and for a year
stuck to dairying. Then old habits reasserted
themselves. He “chucked” farming with em-
phasis and a sigh of reliqf, and went boundary-
riding out West. About the way the overflow of
a selector’s herd run on stations^ —in one case I
know of a man who owned five acres of land, and
yet had over 200 head of cattle and 100 horses.
He was cheerfully prepared to swear, if necessary,
that the whole lot ran on his five acres, but the
statement was unconvincing somehow.

THE TRAINING OF PRODUCERS.
POULTRY YARDS AT Q.A. COLLEGE, GATTON, SOUTH QUEENSLAND.
BY J. D. FITZGERALD.
As the teeming populations of the Northern
Hemisphere are looking to the new countries for
their raw products—their food, meat, butter,
wool, hides, tallow —so the possessors of a mag-
nificent country like Queensland are always sure
of a foreign market for their products. No mat-
ter how rapidly their energies' may develop pro-
duction, the hungry world is waiting for more.
The home market, too, grows apace. As the dif-
ferent communities composing the Australian
Commonwealth develop their industries on special
lines, so the spaces which are open for the new
populations to occupy will always attract the
primary producer ; and the more settled portions
will provide an inexhaustible market in competi-
tion with, and in addition to, the markets of the
world. The organised Australian nation faces
the future with a newly-awakened consciousness
of coming commercial and political greatness.
The Protective tariff established on the inaugura-
tion of the Commonwealth has had two significant
results—(l) It threw down the internecine barriers
created hy separate State tariffs, and decreed
freedom of exchange, trade and commerce through-
out Australia ; and (2) it shut out, in many lines,
the products of foreign nations which employ
cheaper labor at wages lower than the high
standard fixed by Australian sentiment, as
essential for the growth of the nation; and
allowed industries to be established which were
formerly impossible owing to the competition of
cheap labor in foreign countries (and to the policy
of “dumping” abroad in order to maintain home
prices).
The establishment of native home industries
means much to our primary producers. It means
employment—(l) of capital, (2) of labor, and (3)
of professional skill. When a man invests his
capital in a community by starting a woollen
factory, or iron works, or by opening a gold or
a coal mine, he immediately sets in motion the
belting of a vast piece of machinery. Suppose a
hundred men are directly employed at decent
wages, in any of these industries. Average their
family at five, and you get 500 people provided
for. Then, from this central point, employment
of labor and capital spreads concentrically. The
butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker, the
doctor, undertaker, lawyer, banker, hotelkeeper,
the printer, fruiterer—and, further out atilQ the

orchardist, the farmer, the primary producer in
all branches come in for the benefits which the
establishment of an industry brings.
Australia has made a beginning with the manu-
facture of woollens. Within a reasonable time
she should be one of the greatest producers of
cloth the world has ever seen. In six years end-
ing 1906 Britain imported wool from the Com-
monwealth to the value of £52,728.607; France,
£19,863,703; Germany, £14,625,602; Belgium,
£9,525,527 ; and the United States of America,
£3,204,741. The production of this enormous
wealth meant the employment of thousands of
Australian workers in bush-work, shearing, wash-
ing, pressing, handling the wool on the wharves,
But, as our own woollen manufactures grow
apace, there will be 10 times the number employed
that are now employed in the wool industry from
the pasture to the ship’sside ; because the handling
and ad the processes will not only call for more
men, but the additional propess of manufacture
will employ managers, weavers, and mill hands.
clerks, engineers, overseers ; and the hundred and
one tradesmen who go to form the staff of
a woollen mill, together with the dependents
enumerated above bankers, bakers, doctors,
chemists, butchers, lawyers and laborers.
To-day, the mills which make our splendid wool
into cloth are in Bradford, Lille, Roubaix, Dort-
mUnd, Oberhausen, Bielefeld, Belfast, Man-
Chester. In time our own workmen, our own
capitalists, will work up the raw product, and ex-
port the finished article. When that time
arrives—and it is fast approaching—the farmer
and primary producer of Queensland- will
have their home markets enlarged a bun-
dred fold, and will still have the foreign market
in reserve. I saw an example of the rise of a
great manufacturing industry. In 1897 I visited
the picturesque old town of Detmold, in West-
phalia (a few hours ride by train from Berlin),
where sleepy old forests exist to-day which may
have rung with the clashing arms when there came
the shook of -the meeting of the legions of the
Roman Varus with the Cheruskian tribesmen of
Arminius. Around this sleepy old town a ring of
great and busy manufacturing towns has sprung
up with swift growth, nursed into life, youth and
splendid manhood by the Bismarckian policy and
tariff of 1878. Within a few miles of the forests,,
in which deer are roaming, there are the monu-
mental stacks of hundreds of chimneys, the clang,
of a thousand hammers, the whir of a thousand
wheels of industry.
And what has been the result ? The farmer’s
son is no longer a serf of the soil. The enlarged
market supplied by the .growing industries made
his father’s farm a fortune, not a mere livelihood.
The capital thus acquired went in education for
his children, and in improved farming processes

for himself The increased capital which
the enlarged market brought him was in-
vested in the growing industries of the neighbor-
ing town, while, the sons became scientific farmers,
skilled mechanics, industrial chemists, small em-
ployers, manufacturers, and-even rich merchants,
bankers and professional men, This was the:
policy which enables Germany to build Dread-
noughts and to put four million armed men on a
war-footing in a week. This was done by education
in all branches and careful preparation in advance.
And this is what Queensland is doing with her
State Departments, highly organised, pursuing
their bold course, careless of the taunt conveyed
in the word “Socialism.” This is what her
schools are doing vyith their bursaries, exhibi-
tions and scholarships';' her technical school's, her
teaching of mining arid-metallurgy ; her agricul-'
tural and tropical culture colleges. This is what
makes her the country par excellence to which the
emigrant may turn with confidence, knowing that
her progress is ever onward—that she is developing
her marvellous resources by patient preparation,
by patriotic policy, by training her youth for the
battle-ground of industrial expansion. It might
be well to describe one of the means which the
State has provided for this advancement,
The Queensland Agricultural College is situ-
ated at Gatton, about 58 miles from Brisbane.
Appurtenant to it is a farm of 1692 acres of land,
carved out from the virgin forest. Four hundred
acres of this have been cleared and brought under
crop. The farm and college buildings (including
living houses and teachers’ residences) occupy a
commanding situation on a sandstone ridge.
which runs across the centre of the property, and
the buildings, which are 80ft. above Lockyer
Creek, are splendidly equipped, and lighted by
electricity. The appurtenances consist of: —
1. Farm, garden, orchard, and vineyard.
2. Cowshed, stable, tool room, harness room,
implement shed, two silos, barn, and black-
smith’s shop.
3. A stud of high-class Clydesdale horses.
4. A dairy factory, with refrigerator, pasteur-
iser, milking and cheese-making machines.
5. A dairy herd of 130 cows, including Ayr-
shires. Jerseys, Holsteins, Shorthorns, Devons
and Grades.
6. A piggery, with 250 Berkshire, Yorkshire,
Tam worth and British black pigs.

Candidates must be at least 14 years of age
when they submit themselves to the entrance test.
This test consists of an examination in reading,
writing, spelling, arithmetic, and English compo-
sition, with such optional subjects as the theory
and practice of agriculture, the elements of botany
or chemistry, and practical agriculture. Testi-
monials as to character must be produced, and
medical certificates as to health. The main aims
of the system are set out in the official report as
follows .
The CoUeye is purely agricultural. The training,
studies, and work of teachers and pupils are all planned
to the end that they may help young men to a knowledge
of the methods and reasons of successful farming. There
is no thought of making learned men ; but-no effort will
be spired.in aiding the development of useful ones. The
claims made, for general culture and mental discipline,
separately considered, in course of study, we feel safe in
ignoring. There is both culture and discipline in daily
work faithfully done and lessons honestly learned, though
work and lessons relate only to the future occupation of
the pupil.
Each pupil actively participates in all the operations of
a well-conducted farm. The art of agriculture is taught
in such a manner as to fix the habit of work in the student,
as well as to give familiarity with the practical details of
farm life. All the operations of the College Farm are
planned with a view to the educational wants of the
students and the upbuilding of the agriculture of the
State through experiment; but strict regard is had to

economy and the profitable outcome of all farming-under-
takings. The labor system here outlined, besides giving
familiarity with actual farming, fixes the habit of work at
that time in trie life of the man when character is formed
and habits become second nature. The lesson in the
lecture-room is emphasised in the work of garden, field,
and dairy; thus the chemistry of books and of the
laboratory becomes something real when the application
of ft is^ e ?, n in Cl } ltivated soils and growing crops.
The College plays an important part in the improve-
ment of agriculture. Agriculture is, first of all, the
creature of experiment. The most scientific and carefully
planned methods must be marked “doubtful” until
sanctioned in the practices of farmers. To young com-
munities like Queensland much of the old in general agri-
culture is new, requiring adaptation and the Confirmation
of actual experiment. Few farmers have the equipment
of means and education required in conducting accurate
experiments on special lines. The experimental work of
the College follows lines laid down in the general
practice of farmers of the State ; but, while following', it
also leads. The work properly includes cultural tests of
standard crops; trials of new and promising sorts ; the
effects of different manures uporiVarious crops ; trials of
grasses and forage plants; tests of different stock foods in
the production of milk and meat; the growth of fibre
plants ; researches into the scientific and economic ques-
tions involved in the production of butter and cheese ;
improvements in dairy stock ; methods of silo-making and
the manufacture of ensilage; the analysis of soils ; the
chemical analysis of manures, natural and artificial, and
of the various products of the farm, garden, and orchard.
There are two college semesters : (1) July to De-
cember (21 weeks), and (2) January to June (22
weeks), with a midsummer and tt midwinter
vacation. The first and second years include the
following subjects :—Arithmetic, botany, elemen-
tary science and physics, business correspondence,
and bookkeeping, veterinary science, elementary
chemistry, mensuration, drawing, farming, gar-
dening and mechanical work, animal husbandry—
(a) breeding and feeding of animals, (6) study of
horses, cattle, sheep and pigs, their improvement
by breeding, (c) principles and practice of hand-
ling and judging animals; bee-keeping, poultry-
raising, wool-classing; the third year includes
agriculture and stock-breeding, bacteriology, agri-
cultural chemistry, veterinary science, industrials,
animal husbandry (as above), dairying, wool-
classing. “The work is so arranged,” says the
prospectus, “that all varied operations of the
farm and shop are encountered by the student in
the course of the year. As students advance in
the course, opportunities for special work will be
afforded those who may wish to concentrate their
efforts on chosen subjects.”
Four bursaries are given annually to candidates
from 14 to 16 years of age, “ of sound constitution
and in good health,” who have been two years
resident in the State, and this entitles the winner
to free board and instruction as a resident student
for three years. The yearly charge, which covers
tuition, board, washing, room, rent, and lights, is
£27, or a little over 10s. per week. Each student
must have two suits of working clothes, two white
suits for dairy, one or more suits for Sunday wear,
two pairs strong boots, one pair slippers, one dark
apron for laboratory work, hair brush and comb,
clothes brush, one small mirror, one bag for
soiled linen, sufficient sheets, towels, pillow-cases,
and change of other clothing to last two weeks.
All bed clothing, including mosquito-curtain, to
be found by students. Students’ rooms are fur-
nished by the College with bedstead, mattress,
one chair, table, and lights.
There is also provision at the College for
“special-course students,” limited in number,
who may take up such subjects as poultry and
bee-farming; dairying in all its branches ; general
orchard work; genera] farm work ; pig-farming
and bacon-curing.
These students must attend all lectures in con-
nection with any of the above special subjects.
The fee for any special course shall be £2 25., pay-
able in advance.
The staff of the College consists of Mr. John
Mahon, principal; Mr. P. M. Pitt, licensed sur-
veyor, English and mathematical master, secretary
and librarian; G. B. Brooks, farm foreman;
E. H. Youngman, superintendent of dairy; M.
Jordan, assistant farm foreman ; Jas. Carew,
horticulturist; W. Hindes, poultry expert; Jas.
Lyle, engineer; H. Aberdeen, carpenter; W.
Strath, blacksmith. And the visiting lecturers
are J. F. Bailey (in botany); G. Tucker (in veter-
inary science); E. H. Gurney (in chemistry).
It would be of absorbing interest to the reader
if space permitted quotations from the report of
the Principal for the years 1907-8, showing the
splendid work done, and the experiments carried
out for the benefit of the whole of the agricul-
turists of the State of Queensland. Moreover,
here are elaborate tables of experiment in respect
to the producing capacity of dairy cattle, which

Young Woman Found in Awful Con-
dition with Scabies—Body a Mass
of Sores from Scratching—Tried
Many Remedies for Seven Weeks
—Result Was Discouraging, But
ITCHING TORTURES
YIELDED TO CUTICURA
“While I was doing missionary work
In the lower portion of several cities I
found it necessary to know a little of
the efficacy of a few medicines and
after a while I found that a little knowl-
edge of Cuticura was about all I needed.
One of the very bad cases I had to deal
with was that of a young woman who
had come to us not only broken in
spirit but in a most awful condition
physically. Our doctor examined her
and told us that she had scabies (tne
itch), incipient paresis, rheumatism,
etc., brought on from exposure and the
effects of her ragged-edged life. Hex-
poor body was a mass of sores from
scratching and she was not able to
retain solid food. We tried many things,
a good tonic was prescribed and baths
with a rubbing of lard and sulphur. We
worked hard for seven weeks and you
can imagine how discouraged were
when, after all that time; we could see
so little improvement. One day I hap-
pened to see a Cuticura advertisement
telling how a little baby had been
cured of a bad case of skin eruption,
and although I had but 97 cents (four
shillings) with me, I bought a cake of
Cuticura Soap and a bottle of Cuticura
H,esolvent. When I reached home I
was like a child with a new toy, and we
bathed our patient well and gave her a
full dose of the Resolvent. She slept
that night better than she had since
she had been with us and the next day
I located the price of a box of Cuticura
Ointment. I am not exaggerating
when I say that in exactly five weeks
this young woman was able to look for
a position, being strong enough to work
and full of ambition. In another
month she left the home, strong and well.

“0.K.”: Our local theological discus-
sionists, who are just now worrying over the
question why the Churches are empty, might get
an idea on the subject from Liang Lan Hsung,
the Chinese Consul-General, who has been hold-
ing forth in Melbourne, In China, as the yellow
gentleman lately remarked, there is no sectarian
bitterness, seeing that Confucius —500yearsB.O.—
founded a religion of toleration which is practi-
cally the very reverse in sentiment of the Christian
religion. An “earnest Christian” is necessarily
a combative dogmatist and a missionary at heart,
with the result that since he broke up into several
different varieties of dogmatists, he ' as developed
into various brands of missionary, a id the pore
heathen—where the pore heathen has any think-
ing capacity—finds him equally perplexing and
arrogant in his teachings. Confucius, so far from
exhorting his earnest followers to go forth and
preach his gospel to every people, taught them
to refrain from troubling about other persons’
religious beliefs if they didn’t want to be “con-
verted” themselves. Therefore, all the successive
generations of Chows, from Confucius’s time right
up to date, have regarded toleration as the first
law of religious nature. Nothing in the history of
Christianity seems more ridiculously sinful to an
educated “ John ” than the Crusades in the first
place, and the Catholic-Protestant rival massacres
of later ages. As for the humorless animosities of
modern sectarianism —on which priests and par-
sonsthrive, and whereof parsons complain that they
are getting the worst of the deal —the Chow dis-
misses them with a bland smile. He doesn’t stoop
to consider the warring claims of the European
societies that waste so much money in trying—or
pretending to try—to change his religious convic-
tions. He doesn’t take the “ missionally ” man
seriously. The most ignorant of the Chinese,
which is to say an immense majority of them,
draw no distinction between the “missionally”
sort of “ foleign devil ” and other sorts of “ foleign
devil.” If they did, they would be “ allee same
as Clusaders,” trying to rid their own particular
Holy Land of infidels. But Confucius—soo years
B.C. —filled their land with the notion that holi-
ness has religious toleration for its bed-rock.
Which is an unfortunate fact as it happens. If
Liang Lan Hsung uad come out here to preach
religion to the pore “ Klistians,” he might have
done us a bit of good, although he, tongue in
cheek, inconsistently urges those of his country-
men who have adopted “ Clistianity ” to take a
hand in the combative game, and do all they can
towards passing the Bible around Lilly Buck-
street.
War may be sheol—but even temporary
sheol is preferable to the degeneracy that mani-
fests itself in the clothing of dogs. Europe and
some of America have now slid down to the level
where a Something dwells which gets it food and
shelter by designing and making fashionable gar-
ments for the animal that barks and scratches it-
self on the mat. When people arrive at that
stage, a big trouble is urgently needed to shame
and shock them back to ways of sanity. Thus
far, no delving scientist antiquarian has dug out of
ancient Rome anything that can give this yarn
many points :
A leading dog-’s tailor in Paris has issued his winter-
novelties circular, which shows that canine fashion has
undergone certain modifications. A chic tailor-made
mantle replaces last year’s sealskin jacket. The new
mantle is specially designed to protect the dog’s chest
when accompanying his mistress in her carriage or motor-
car. Fido’s handkerchief is now carried in a little purse
attached to the leash. The lady experts whose specialty
is canine hairdressing have decreed that the Parisiennes’
pampered pets must use the same perfume as their mis-
tresses. The jewellery most in request for aristocratic
dogs this winter will be gold bracelets, ornamented with
diamonds, attached to the forelegs. The collar is fre-
quently enriched with precious stones. Footwear for
dogs has been condemned, as it made the pet’s feet look
large. Smart motoring dogs are now provided with
automobile goggles and hoods to protect them from dust.
The pity is that when a big war comes the worst
of the suffering will fall on the man or woman
who has to toil hard for a precarious crust, and
whose dog goes about, unashamed, in a perfectly
nude condition. The male and female degenerates
would be able to fly to foreign parts with Fido in
his embroidered pyjamas. But it is good to think
that their term of exile would probably be em-
bittered by the thought that the beast’s lunch-
bangle was left in his jewel-case, and his silk
handkerchief taken by a soldier to clean his gun
with. And it may be that when next the Prus-
sian hordes bombard Paris the first shell will
burst on the premises of the dog-tailor, and scatter
his collection of dog-fashions to the four winds.
Thus an Old Soldier :
The first note of war against Australia will be the
booming of the enemy’s cannon. Formal declarations of
war are things of the past. Borne in its heyday kept a
special college of heralds to proclaim war. One of these
hetalds was despatched with a gauntlet which he, with
great ceremony, threw down before the king of the
enemy’s country, and then he delivered his verbal declar-
ation. Louis XIII. sent a herald to proclaim war against
Spain. At different times, Sweden versus Denmark, and
England v. Holland went to war on the same terms. But
that was long ago. Now each country tries to get in the
first blow. Australia’s only rule should be to get ready,
keep ready, and watch possible enemies. To wait till
war is declared against Britain and till the news is cabled
here is to provide a funeral.
“Bobstay”: Winston Churchill, of the
present British Government, has introduced a
Bill to stop marine insurance gambling by per-
sons who heavily insure overdue ships in which
they have not the remotest interest. A vessel is
posted as overdue, and that is a signal for 200 or
300 people to insure either for or against her, at
rates that run up to 90 guineas per cent. This
gamble often prevents the owners from covering
their legitimate risk. So W. Churchill is stepping
in. But it isn’t only the outsiders who gamble”.
About ten years ago a sailing ship left a British
port for a South American one. Before it left
the owner explained to the skipper that he wasn’t
in any dashed hurry. The skipper could loaf as
much as he liked. A few weeks’ fishing on
the equator, it was suggested, would be a nice
sport. The vessel was posted as overdue with re-
insurance at 15 guineas per cent. The owner
grabbed all the money going. The vessel became
more and more overdue, and insurance went up
to all sorts of prices per cent. The owner took
all the business that was going. The ship
never turned up to this day, and the owner,
when last heard of, was looking for a feed
at a Salvation Army soup kitchen. That
man’s experience was something akin to the
thing that befell a Bristol (Eng.) shipowner
some 60 or 70 years ago. At that time the Eng-
glish seaman was a superstitious animal, and he
had the Friday superstition worse than any other.
An atheist shipowner decided to cure him of it.
He was getting a new vessel built, and the keel
was laid on a Friday. The vessel was launched
on a Friday. Also, it was named the Friday. It
was impossible to find a captain named Friday to
command, but an able seaman who said his name
was Friday was included in the crew. The vessel
sailed on its first voyage on a Friday, and it was
never heard of again. So the Friday superstition
became worse than ever in Bristol. That owner,
it is said, died very poor, on a Friday.

TO KEEP YOU SICK!
THE first impulse of persons who find that they are ailing in any way is to
plunge into a chemist’s and purchase a box of pills or a bottle of some, patent
medicine. . . Failing to get more than temporary relief from this they then
consult a doctor, and he writes a prescription which more than likely calls for the
same medicine, only in a different form from what the patient has already taken.
The same result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that this
doctor didn’t diagnose the case right, and then goes to another, with the same
result. And so on.
Oup modern medical system Is a foolish system. We practically pay
our doctors to keep us ill. Their prosperity depends not on our health,
BUT ON OUR SICKNESS ! . . . To-day very little Is known of medicine
and its use. The wisest doctor can do but little more than clear out
the system op accelerate the action of the liea.pt. When h.e lias done these
thing's he has reached the end. MEDICINE CANNOT MAKE STRENGTH.
Now, just study yourself for a moment. The failure or breaking down of any
organic function means that it has not strength to do its work. If there was any
nourishment in medicine it might bring about a healthy change, but you know there
is not. Drugs, medicines, stimulants, narcotics and antidotes are POISONS, not
food. Food is needed to build up new energy. Electricity is nerve food, nerve life.
No pain or debility can exist in a body charged with Electric Lifej you can have
no Weaßness, no Inactive Parts, no Rheumatism, Indi-
gestion, Constipation or Kidney Trouble, if you fill your
body with it, because the life generated by this grand force gives health and
strength to every organ, and

vwho are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It is most comforting in allaying Irritation,
lij the Throat and giving Strength to the Voice, and it neither allows a Cough nor Asthma to become chronic, nor Consump-
tion, to develop. Consumption is not known where “Coughs” have, on their first appearance, been properly treated with this
medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose or two is generally sufficient, and a complete
cure? is certain.

Some day there will arise a writer who can do
the story of the cigarette the justice it deserves. The
struggle for supremacy among cigarette-makers has been
as fierce as any that ever raged in the world’s history ;
and it is going on to-day with even more fury than ever.
Just now the pride of place is undoubtedly held by
Abdulla and Co., Ltd., of 9 New' Bond-street, London,
whose Turkish, Egyptian and “ Americaine ” smokes are
sweeping the board. ■ The secret of successful cigarette-
■ making is the maintenance of an unvarying flavor,
aroma and purity. The Abdulla crowd owes its success
to the infinite variety of its flavors and the unswerving
regularity with which they are maintained. Probably
the finest and most delicately-flavored 'cigarette in the
world is Abdulla’s No. 1 Special Turkish. It leaves behind
itabouquetsodelicate.sofleetingandintangible, that the
smoker hardly knows whether it is something he tasted,
heard or smelt. But the charm of it is eternal. All the
Turkish cigarettes are delicate and have that transient
bouquet. But human taste is infinite in its variety. Some
people prefer more body and less aroma, others like the
aroma and the bodj'. For these Abdulla and Co. have
rung the changes on Egyptian tobacco, so that the grades
rise frpnr a smoke that is hard to distinguish from a
Turkish up to something that is full-flavored and strong
enough to satisfy even the confirmed pipe smoker.
Prominent among these is the Special Egyptian, No. 18—
a richly-flavored cigarette with plenty of body, packed
in boxes that look like real ivory surmounted with a red
and green seal, and sold at Bs. 6d. per 100. It is
one of the blends that the company is most proud of.
All this applies to the cigarettes made from Oriental
tobaccos. There is another great smoking world, how-
ever, which likes not Asia or the flavors thereof, but
which loves the arotna-less tobacco of Virginia with its
distinctive flavor. These are catered for in the VAmeri-
caine ” varieties. As mentioned before, w'hat has made
the Abdulla cigarette the world’s favorite is the loyalty
of each class of smoke to its distinctive flavor. No. 1
Turkish Special is always the same. The man w'ho has
been charmed with its haunting flavor has no fears that he
will never experience it again, like the listener in the Lost
Chord or the consumer of the Lost Drink. By
keeping enormous stocks ranging over the crops of
several years, and by employing highly-paid scientists
to look after the young plants, and graft, cross and fer-
tilise them to produce certain results, the Abdulla people
are able to reproduce any flavor they may have acci-
dentally'discovered. For a cigarette flavor is not made—-
it is found by accident, like a gold-mine. But, unlike
the mine, when once found it can ahvays be maintained
if the manufacturer spends the necessary time, trouble
and money' on it. Space does not admit of goint- into
this matter further, but any smoker who is interested can
obtain samples at any' good tobacconist’s. In the event
of any difficulty, the" smoker may communicate with Mr,
Flockhart, York Chambers, Market Street, Sydney, who
will supply' the name of the nearest tobacconist who
handles these goods.*

THE THERMOS FLASK.
EVERY Squatter, Motorist, Yachtsman, and everyone whose work or pleasure
takes them out into the heat or cold, will find the celebrated THERMOS
FLASK invaluable.
It keeps hot drinks hot for 24 hours and cold drinks cold for days.
Fill it up with a pint of hot tea in the early morning, and when you
feel you would like a drink of hot tea, it is there just as when you poured
if in. Just the same with an iced whisky and soda, or any other cold drink.
Thermos, Invaluable for Infants.
Here, there, everywhere you go a Thermos proves its utility. In the
nursery it is invaluable.
In the park, away from the nursery, Thermos gives hot milk, clean —
fresh —health-giving. No trouble at all to carry.
At eventime or early morn soothing hot liquids always ready. No trouble —
no preparation —if your nurse has a Thermos.
The sick room lacks proper equipment if a Thermos is not to hand.
Workers with hand and brain, from navvy to monarch, use Thermos. Every
and anyone must recognise that Thermos is invaluable, indispensable; on
pleasure bent or on work intent Thermos is invaluable just the same. Depend
on yourself for a cooling drink, a hot drink—Thermos will provide both—a
drink that is fresh and inviting and can be had just when you want it. The
man, or woman, provided with a Thermos Flask waits no one's pleasure only
his or her own.
Makes a splendid gift from one friend to another, or for a wife to give to
her husband. j
THERMOS FLASK, nickelled finish, and covered with plain leather, to

inside of 18 days, and it takes the second pr ze
in the same competition with three Ministries
formed inside 26 days. But in another branch of
the struggle Westralia, which saw four Ministries
come into office in one year, scoops the pool, and
holds the fort against ail comers.

The Milk Foods closely approximate in composition to
human Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant
They are as easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns-
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Allenburys” Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

Night and day, until the strength is entirely
exhausted, and that dreadful word “Consump-

That’s a common story, familiar to the people of

Grand Dairying Country, indeed, is MOUNT
LARCOMBE ESTATE, which we are now
subdividing. To the dairyman, the most import-
ant question is one of water, and this is answered
most satisfactorily at Mount Larcomhe. The
average rainfall there is 43 inches, and every
block is permanently watered by running streams.
The flats are very fertile, splendidly adapted for
maize, potatoes, and lucerne. The hills are
warm and sheltered, and the whole Estate pro-
duces those rich luscious grasses that njean a
big butter yield.
MOUNT LARCOMBE
is divided into areas to suit purchasers, whose
fares we pay from any part of the States.
Very low prices—ten years terms —no survey

THAT’S ALL
and then you will be sure of getting a whisky made from the
purest materials, a whisky best for health and best for pleasure ;
and with a uniformity of flavour, which can only be guar-
anteed in a whisky offered by the proprietors of a distillery
devoting their whole production to their own brand.
The proprietors of the Stromness Distillery,
which is the oldest, farthest north distillery, have
been making 0.0. (Old Orkney) for generation
after generation. 0.0. possesses that delicate
flavour and exquisite aroma so rarely to be found
in whisky; and as they always hold in their own
bonded store a ten years supply, you can always
rely on getting it exactly the same, no matter
in what part of the world you are.
If you have any difficulty in obtaining 0.0. please write direct
to the distillery giving name of your usual store.

The Poet’s Kiss.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
yg COMEDY—a tragedy—
/V A broken head , or egg—
£ And some of us would laugh to see
A blind man’s wooden leg.
So much that seerneth sad is gay—
, That seerneth weal is woe —
That, till it’s sung , I cannot say
If this song’s sad or no.
Her freckled face was small and sweet,
Her large grey eyes were sad ;
Through cold and slush, and dust and heat,
She slaved to help her dad.
By ridges brooding ever now,
And gullies deep and dark,
She milked the everlasting cow
Out there at, Stringybark.
It was a fearsome life indeed,
That few might understand ;
Her only pleasure was to read
The poets of the land—
The songs of drovers far away,
Of love, and city strife ;
And Men that Might Have Been—’twas they
Who brightened her young life.
And when the evening milk was set,
And poddy calves were fed,
And when she’d cooked what she could get
For Dad and Tom and Ted,
And when she’d penned the calves and brought
The morning’s firewood in.
She had a rest (as so she ought)
And read The Bulletin.
There was a bard who sang the Bush,
The ocean wide and wild,
The bushmen and the city push—
She’d read him when a child :
He sang of Hope and grim Despair,
Of backs bent to the rod,
Of fights for freedom everywhere.
And—oh ! he was her god.
He sang of gaunt bushwomen slaves,
Of bush girls sad and lone ;
Of broken hearts and lonely graves
(Of others’, and his own);
He sang of many a noble deed,
And many an act of grace :
And, all her life, since she could read,
llhij’d longed to see his face.
She pictured him with hurtling eyes,
And heavy hair thrown back
Frdtn gloomy brows'so worldly wise
Ahd sadly on the rack.
A wasted form—transparent hands
That angels might caress :
A heart that ached for many lands,
clean but careless dress.
She longed to take those hands of his,
Attd, with her spirit, bow,
Attd itiSs them, if she dared not kiss
His lips, or gloomy brow.
She longed to look into his eyes.
And ash him, with a sigh,
If they might meet in Paradise —
And then go home and die.
They’d three green seasons after brown
(So runs the world away) ;
They sent her down to Sydney town
To have a holiday.
In fear and trembling—yet with joy—
In fluttering hope and doubt,
And, eager-hearted as a boy,
She sought her poet out.
She found him too, no matter how,
Nor does it matter where ;
The gloom upon his grimy brow
Was hidden by his hair.
The poet’s words were thick and slow,
The poet’s chin was slack ;
His bloodshot eyes were burning, though,
And one of them was black.
His clothes were careless, right enough,
But they were far from clean,
And he was, briefly—in the rough—
The Man He Might Have Been.
He heard her worship with a laugh,
Her sorrow with a frown—
He scrawled a drunken autograph,
And borrowed half-a-crown.
The sky is lead—storm-waters whirl
Down gullies deep and dark,
And there’s a disillusioned girl
Far out at Stringybark.
And, after all, there is a chance,
* This is a song of woe—
’Twas sung to buy a pair of pants,
And that is all I know.

“Fair Sweating.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
bay was in midnight quietude,
except for the soft siss of fine rain and the
dripping of water from the leaves of the
fig-trees. There was also a sound of wavelets
churning up the beach, or gurgling among the rock
fissures.
The road at the back of the bay dipped between
two hill bosoms, and from these eminences could
be seen the myriad lights of the city, like a star-
spangled sky come to earth.
Along the road came a Blot. It came with a
shuffling gait, broken and sodden soles squelching
water. The collar of the Blot was turned up. the
shoulders hunched, and the head sunk as if to
escape some of the rain. Yet there was a definite
purpose in its walk. It passed through the break
in the stone fence, and from a tree it dislodged a
bundle. Securing the parcel, it descended towards
the beach, and at length knelt before a crevice in
the rock, groping forward with its hands. Then
came a check.
“ ’Ere, wot ye’re doin’ ’ere ? ” the Blot ex-
claimed, angrily.
It paused for a reply, but none came.
“ Yer’d better git aat uv ’ere, an’ quick, let me
tell yer! ”
Still there was silence.
“Are yer cornin’?” And then “There’ll be
trouble if yer don’t come aat. Now, then, I carn’t
be waitin’ all night. Yer knows yer can’t do what
yer likes here. We has rules.”
There was only dead stillness. The Blot stood
up and looked helpless. Then it retired to a ledge
a few feet off, and placed its chin on its palm and
stared at the crevice. A few minutes passed by,
and then it said in an injured tone of voice :
“ S’pose yer don’t know it’s mine, or yer
wouldn’t do it.” After a space it added, with a
deeper tone of injury : “ Yer carn’t ’ave any right
feelin’s, or yer’d git aat when I speaks to yer like
a gen el man.”
Time stole on, and no reply came to the gentle-
man’s speech.
“ Somethin’’ll ’appen to yer if yer don’t git
aat.”
The fear of consequences brought no response.
“ Yer don’t know, but I ’ave friends, and one of
them might be a pug. See? Coves like you
ought to be burned.”
The rain hissed, and the leaves dripped, and the
wavelets swished.
“ Yer’ll be sorry for this, you see. I might do
somethin’ meself if yer don’t git aat.”
A voice from a crevice on the upper tier of
rocks called, “Wot’sther matter, Willy?”
“Oh, nothing!” Then, after a pause, “Only
some cove ’as copped me doss.”
“ Fire ’im out,” advised a thicket of ti-trees to
the right.
“ Bash him wif a rock,” urged the roots of the
Port Jackson fig.
“ I will in two minutes if he don’t git aat.”
Comments then arose along the foreshore, the
boulders and crevices passing on the news to the
pittosporums and eugenia longifolias that some
bloke had copped Willy’s doss. The two minutes’
limit went by, and 10 minutes stole past in silent,
measured paces, yet still the Blot sat with its
chin in its palm.
“ It’s me own doss,” it said. “ I bought it.”
Then the voice of the disputed doss spoke :
“ What did yer give for it?”
“Wot’s that ter do wif you? You mind yer
own business and git aat uv it.”
“Serves yer right, Willy,” said the roots of the
Port Jackson fig. “Yer should keep better
hours. It’s past twelve—l ’eard the post-office
clock more’n half a hour ago. No wonder yer
gets yer doss jumped.”
“It’s all right for yous coves ter talk, but a
feller has to bum or starve, and I has to bum for
more’n meself.”
Interest seemed to peter out then. Within a
quarter of an hour the Blot said, limply, “Yer’d
better git aat.”
“Whodid yer buy it of?” asked the crevice
that had been jumped.
“ Stinker Williams. Hey, Stinker ! ”
Then the big boulder directly beneath cried,
“ Hello.”
“ Come ’ere.”
The Boulder gave birth to a second Blot, which
clambered up.
“ Didn’t I buy this doss uv you ? ”
“ Yuss.”
“ Here’s a cove wot jumped it then.”
“ Give’s er match and le’s look at ’im.”
The feeble flame of a vesta leapt out and lit up
two eves in the crevice.
“ Oh,” said Willy. “ It’s you.”
“Yes, it’s me,” said the voice belonging to the
eyes.
“ Who is ’e ? ” asked Stinker.
“ It’s the cove wot wanted me to ’ave dinnerwif
him at Paris ’Ouse, You know ! We went ter
Sargeant’s instead, an’ he finished fust and says
he would pay as he went aat. You know ; I told
yer all about it. A feller tossed me aat, and then
kicked me.”
“ Well, wot yer makin’ a fuss about? Yer got
wot yer wanted, a fat feed, didn’t yer? ” said the
voice within the crevice with keen sarcasm.
“ Why did yer take me to a toff place, then ? ”
asked the aggrieved Blot.
“Did yer want a fourpenny feed? Great
Christopher, a man like you didn’t deserve a feed
at all. I’m not takin’ any fourpenny feeds, any-
how ; at least, only w’en I’ve got ther fourpence.”
A murmur of approval came from the ti-tree
and Port Jackson fig. ' The Blot lost prestige,
and then the voice from the crevice said to
Stinker:
“ Wot did ’e give yer for the doss?”
“ He bums fer me.”
“ ’Ow much ?”
“ Three bumpers en a long beer every day.”
“Oh !”
The disputed crevice cogitated a time, and then
asked :
“ Will yer bum for me, then ? ”
“ ’Ow much ? ”
“ Six bumpers en two long beers.”
“It can’t be did,” said the Blot, decisively.
“ Tell yer wot, I’ll give yer one bumper and ’alf
me beer at 11 o’clock. I wouldn’t do it only I
wuz brought up well, en I git rheumatiz.”
A few minutes passed, and then the voice in
the shelter said, “ All right! ” And the crevice
was delivered of an object.
The Blot picked up its bundle and wormed it-
self out of sight, muttering, “It’s er blinded
shame ! It oughter be written about in the
papers. I wish I ’ad a nob on me.”
Then he raised his voice.
“ Some aw yous coves wots got nobs on yer
oughter write to the ’Erald, or the Telegraff,
erbout this sort aw business. It’s fair sweatin’,
that’s wot it is. I’ve bought this doss oncet, and
it’s not fair that I’ve gotter bum fer another cove
to git it. If ever I gits another cove in me doss
I’ll ’eave a rock in, if I git a monf fer it. If this
cove ’adn’t got aat, I’d ’ave let him ’ave one
quick. I wouldn’t’a’minded on’y I got rheu-
matiz. A lot uv these coves wot comes jumpin’
dosses oughter be thrown in ther bay.”
This observation appeared to rouse the ire of
the object who had just sold the doss.
“Chuck it naow, chuck it. If I ’ear any more
uv yer tongue, I’ll ’eave a rock in on yer.”
“I’m not talkin’,” said the Blot.
“ Does any uv yous blokes know where’s another
doss ? ” the object said.
“ Yer’ll find a place the other side of Stinker’s
boulder. Yon know, the doss that bloke ’ad who
wuz taken to Little Bay wif bubonic or somefing.”
It was the roots of the Port Jackson fig which
gave the information.
The object was absorbed by the boulder, and
peace settled on the bay. The wavelets swished
up the sand, the rain sissed softly, and the water
dripped from the leaves of the trees.

LIVER TROUBLE
Suffered for Years —Domestic Duties were a
Burden—Many Treatments Failed to Cure.
If you consider for a moment the importance of liver health in your
internal economy, you will realise that a medicine which will tone up and
correct the liver is a prime necessity to you. Your liver takes charge of
all the food juices from your stomach
and bowels, and transforms them into
rich red blood. It filters all poisons
and waste products from your food and
from your blood, and also provides a
fluid called bile, which plays an impor-
tant part in intestinal digestion.
The most reliable way to keep your
liver healthy is to take Bile Beans, the
most successful remedy for biliousness
and indigestion, and all ailments arising
from disorder of the liver and stomach.
“ For the greater part,of my life,” writes
Mrs. M. Tuohy, of Franklin Street, Ade-
laide, S.A., “I have been a great sufferer
from biliousness, headache, indigestion,
and palpitation, and I find nothing to give
me speedier relief than Bile Beans, Even
from the contents of the first box I felt an
improvement, and, continuing the course,
the biliousness and headaches gradually left
me, and I was ultimately perfectly cured.
Since then I have no need to have anyone in attendance in Iny house, as i am per-
fectly able to do my own household duties, and 1 never felt better in my life.
I had tried every kind of medicine in search of relief, but each and every one
failed to do me any good. My greatest pleasure now is advising friends and neigh-
bors, who may be suffering from biliousness or any liver trouble, to waste no time
in experimenting, but get a box of Bile Beans-—the ever-reliable liver medicine.”

Who Sails.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHO sails to the World’s End all its ways
shall see.
The Dawn burns red, and his will grows
fierce, to take
A wizard’s path through all of its realms there be
Swiftly, for pleasure-tide, ere the heart may break.
Like clouds in a swinging mirror, hour upon hour
In pictures passing. Ways of the World sweep by-
Grey witches, watching for gods in the misty
shower
Of a forest-fall, their curved claws raised to the sky.
Lonely clouded rivers, restless, empty of balm,
’Twixt rifted and moonwhite banks; tiger-
princesses and slaves ;
Black kingdoms, sanded and drowning in deserts
beyond the palm,
Pale weed-swathed phantom cities rising from
glittering waves;
Or crupnbling towers, whence Lords-of-the-
Maimed weave spells
To gather the soul to Peace,, where the senses rust;
Or towns all silken, murmurous, singing with
caravan-bells.
Come quench your dreams in the Mart. . . and its
hurrying dust;
Or dark imperious loves by their casements set,
With mother-of-pearl in the midnight flower of
their hair :
Lanterns of flaming silver, and glances, shadow-
and-jet, -
Dream-litten, bended to hold him who halts not
there—
Whose way is swift from these to the colored
waves
Scarred by the winds and crossed with foam like
snow,
Or paths through red buds threaded ’twixt green-
lit caves
In smoky valley-hearts where the gipsies go :
Till he last sad way where wizards
sleep
And color dies ; where the path is blurred with
rain
And the baying of years from the mist grows
near and deep,
Like wolves in a land forgotten, to fade again,
Where snow-peaks rise, as the South-lights dance
and reel;
Where bergs glow white ; where sharp ice bites
the shore;
And grim with menace, chiller than glittering
steel
The stars of the Pole rise up from the ocean-floor,
And shrouded Gods-of-the-World steal round, to
sow
His doom, who sail to the End of the World dare
bend ;
Like veiled hills moving, stealthy, hooded with
snow
Ranged in a closing circle they bring the end,
They drain the freezing veins of his body bowed,
Each lured to his life’s red flower like a ghastly
bee.
Their lips are like splintered ice as they pierce
the shroud. !
Who sails to the End of the World all its ways shall
see.
Their eyes are whiter than cloud.
Who sails to the End of the World all its ways shall
victoria.

My Moan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LET me wail in your ear, Bulletin,
because I’m very tired, and no one will
listen to my ravings. Don’t tell me it’s
all as old as ink, because it’s all new to rawness
with me.
I’m tired of dragging up in the mornings and
lighting the kitchen stove —tired of kerosene-tin
buckets—tired of cows. Oh Lord, how sick I am
of cows and cowbells, the spotted calf and the
white heifer, and every other kind of cow and calf
and heifer ! I’m going to spit in the face of the
next cow I see, and throw a clod at its tail.
It makes me tireder when town people look
down their noses and maunder about “keeping
occupied ” and making the best of things. How’d
they like living amongst cow-bells and box-trees—
and cows ? In my dreams I always see cows and
scrubbing brushes chasing me. I always want to
see what’ll’ happen when they do catch me, but
it’s always time to get up before we get into the
straight.
I’m sick of currying cold mutton; the mere
sight of a tin of curry powder makes me feel as if
I were going to have a tooth out. Some day,
when I’ve-got-£5,-and am rich. I’m going to take
out all the bread tins in the house and hammer
them into hieroglyphics. I feel it might make me
young again, j shouldn’t mind dying and going
to Hell a bit; it’d be a change, and it couldn’t be
hotter than our kitchen.
Sometimes o’ nights I go outside, where I can
smell the faint indescribable odor of grass and
earth, and the wind seems to blow away the per-
fume of dish-water which always hangs around.
What devil invented dish-water? Instead of
working, I think of the old days before my nails
were broken and a chronic redness had come on
the fingers that somebody used
I’d like to put on an evening dress again,
though the sun has made me the color.of weak
coffee down to high-water mark. I’d like to go
to dinner at the Australia again, and eat indiges-
tible nice things, and drink that greeny liqueur
which I think is beastly nasty, only nothing
"Vould make me say so. I’d like to go to the
theatre again with some silly ass to buy me choco-
lates and souvenir fans, and say how nice I looked
(though it was never true), and put on my cloak
with that you’re-the-only-woman-in-the-world air
I used to know. I’d like to see men in magpie
again; I’m sick of malt shirtsand yellow trousers.
I’d like to have some vacuous idiot offering me
a chair and tea, and bringing me roses, and, if he
were very nice, I wouldn’t mind sitting on the
seat in the little park at the Lavender Bay steps
with his arm round my waist.
It ’d do my heart good to hear quick, high-
pitched voices again and cackles—only the fowls
cackle in the bush. I’d like to hear the old vapid
talk about theatres and novels and dresses, and
the latest story, and be where no one ever men-
tions weaners and worms and fowls and vege-
tables. I’m sick of the dreary bush common-
places about recipes and babies and husbands—
it’s always babies and husbands in the bush. I'm
sick, sick, sick of everything.
There isn’t even enough water in the creek to
drc \vn myself in, and the clothes-line’s wire, and
I don’t fancy a leg-rope to dangle from. A leg-
rope smells of cow, and besides it seems that you
ought to hang yourself upside-down with a leg-
rope. And the trigger of our one gun won’t work.
If you want to know my opinion of the bush,
it’s “ Damn ! ” There !
MERINO.
The Left Arm of Thothmes
the Third.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE had gone out of his way to say many
unkind, if, indeed, not actionable things
about the Old Gods ; and before you speak
unkind things about persons or gods, you ought to
be sure that they are dead. The living might hit
back. Sometimes even the dead hit back, and
when the dead hit back they hit very hard.
Otherwise he had done very little to disturb the
serenity of the gods, old, dead, or living. He was
a small button of a clergyman, with big, round
spectacles and a flat, flat hat. And being a fol-
lower of a Man who wfmt to wedding breakfasts,
and even, on occasion, provided the wine, he
clothed himself in funereal black and drank the
bride’s health in ginger-ale, neat. But his sermons
were calculated to give the Old Gods the jumps.
He had conceived quite a personal hatred of idols,
and Moloch and Baal aroused in him all the fierce
resentment of an angered sheep. ,His campaign
against these gentleman aroused quite a simmer
of Anglican excitement, and it may be that an
echo of his denunciations was carried to the ears
of the persons most interested.
Otherwise how explain the happening in the
British Museum ? .
Of course, you won’t get the custodians to speak
about it. It was hushed up for a number of
reasons, and the papers were busy just then with
the bye-election. (Smith was elected, but that is
a side issue.
It began with a remark by a candid friend.
“ I say,” he broke in on the parson’s denuncia-
tions of the idols of antiquity, “it’s all very well
for you to revile those old jossers of antiquity, but
have you ever seen ’em ? ”
“No,” said the curate, startled.
“ I have.”
“Where?”
“In the Antiquities room of the British
Museum.”
“ Impossible ! ”
“Not the old chaps themselves, but their
statues. You know the old Egyptian kings were
worshipped as gods—and for all practical purposes
they were gods. Before you say anything more
about ’em you might have a look at ’em—or, at
least, all there is left of ’em ; and if the remnants
of those enormous statues don’t make you think—
well, perhaps, hardly that; but, at least, you’ll
be a little more chary in future about insulting
the civilisation that made ’em.”
So the clergyman went to the British Museum,
and betook his big round spectacles and his flat,
flat hat to the Antiquities Hall. And there, for
the first time, he stood face to face with Antiquity.
And as he gazed on that scrap of the olden
world he shivered. He was so little, after all.
Those enormous fragments of colossal statues
frightened him. He felt himself in one of those
horrible dreams where everything is enormous
and you are shrunk to a diminutive and stifling
atom. In front of him was a stupendous head,
from a colossal statue of Amenophes tlm Fourth,
a capitalist who ran antiquity about 1500 8.0.
The card on its base informed him that the statue
had so stood behind the vocal Mernnon in Thebes.
And lying on a long granite pedestal in front of it,
stretched out with a clenched fist as tali as the
parson was the enormous left arm of xhothmes
the Third, a Fat Man. of the XVIII. dynasty,
B.C. Something Tremendous. It was of black
stone, polished by time, the fist clenched as if
eternally about to strike, the muscles of the nuge
arm rigid with the tension of the threatened
smashing blow.
The clergyman gasped as he took the stupen-
dous thing in. “ Vhat a smack that okl josser
could have given !” he murmured.
But, though ill at ease, he .remembered his olfl
hatred of graven images, and there, in the late
afternoon, alone amid antiquity, he repeated his
libellous statements concerning the idols and gods
of the olden time. It was absurd, of course, for
the clergyman would be undistinguishable fiom
the soil in a hundred years, while that vast arm,
with its fist clenched in divine anger, would
menace the world till'the world itself dissolved.
What followed is difficult to discover. By some
means the clergyman, forgetting the closing hour
and undiscovered by the attendants, was locked
in the British Museum. Probably he went to
sleep behind the columns of the Temple of Diana
of the Ephesian? ; but he must have wakened, too
late, and tried to make his way out. But even
then, in that darkened hall of the ancient world,
he doubtless remembered his hatred. Arid it
seems likely enough that in the loneliness of the
great, closed, silent building he repeated his
opinion of Antiquity.
All that is certain is that next morning his life-
less body was found flung against a sculptured
fragment of a column of the temple of Diana of
Ephesus, his flat skull even flatter than in
life. As for his flat, flat hat, it was practically
crushed into nothingness.
And the attendants, after noting the position of
the body, and cleaning the blood off a naked
nymph upon the base of the column, looked in the
direction from which the liorce had come that
flung the body there. At the other side of the
wide hall they noticed the enormous black left
hand of Thothmes 111. The cement that had
supported the arm on its granite base was cracked
and shattered, almost as if the arm had moved ;
and on the huge, still-clenched fist they dis-
covered a fragment of splintered glass, subse-
quently identified as part of the clergyman’s
spectacles, and a bloody matting of clergyman’s
hair. And it seemed to them that the fist was
more tightly clenched, though, as no photographs
had been taken of the arm, this could not be
corroborated.
It would seem wise that when you insult any-
body you should make sure that that person s
fists are of the ordinary size.
