The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’66 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’66
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’63 Hermitage
The ripening period of 1963
at Coonawarra was
unusually humid, which
seems to have added
subtlety to the wine, giving
it greater delicacy, yet
with a deeply satisfying full
flavour. It may well prove
to be the best Australian
Hermitage ever.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
matured for four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’65 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’65 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

AS WE descended the stairs of the
restaurant where, in an upstairs room,
the ABC had with some lavishness
launched its tentatively titled public
affairs program “Tonight” we saw the
ABC’s head drama man David God-
dard and TV playwright Pat Flower
having a quiet lunch together.
Nineteen-sixty-six, which saw the
beginning of “Australian Playhouse,”
may have been the ABC’s year for
drama; 1967 is certainly “Tonight’s”
year. The ABC has shown or produced
little local drama this year.
However, the ABC’s head of tele-
vision, Ken Watts, agreed that
“Tonight,” with invisibles in the budget,
could cost $1 million a year for a five
nights a week half-hour program.
Whether “Tonight” succeeds or not,
it is becoming clearer that even the
ABC, with its assured income, is finding
it difficult to find money for all its
fields. Perhaps when Mr. Keith Sin-
clair, the Prime Minister’s new cultural
aide, begins work he will find the ABC
lining up behind the well-established
cultural mendicants.
•
HARDLY had the Duke of Edinburgh’s
plane touched down at Canberra when
it began. From the “Sydney Morning-
Herald”: “The Duke: ‘Are you RAAF
wives?’ Bystanders: ‘No, Waafs.’ The
Duke smiled broadly.”
If royal wit has not sharpened or
reporting of royal events grown any
better, it is now obvious that it is
extremely easy for members of the
royal family to have private visits to
Australia; in fact, embarrassingly so.
Perhaps we should try to be just a
little bit more obvious about ignoring
them.

MELBOURNE
Where do we go
for our Blue
Ribbon Security?
THERE HAS always been a fine Pres-
byterian security about Australia’s
largest hotel, the Victoria Coffee
Palace, with its more than 600 rooms.
One knew as one entered its tasteful
portals that here was an establishment
that possessed no bar. Many of us, with
our loved ones, went there from all
over Australia, because we knew that
here was an establishment where our
eyes would never fall upon any creature
tainted by drink.
It is painful to have to report the
news. Our Victoria, the mighty tem-
perance establishment in Little Collins
Street, is seeking a licence for its res-
taurant. Here was the home for all
our Church conferences. The Temper-
ance Associations always had their
lunches at the Coffee Palace.
Your correspondent has seen the
demon make its insidious intrusion
little by little. Over the past three or
four years application has been made
for special functions. It has been noted
that sherry, sweet and dry, has been
served for some official lunches. Well,
on February 1, an announcement was
made that the profit for the previous
12 months has slipped from $166,716
to $160,900. So the directors, apparently
needing a drink, decided to vote for a
liquor licence.
The news is now out that 851,711
shareholders voted for the move and
only 61,508 against.
There was only one strong voice
against, the former head of the Pre-
mier’s Department, Sir John Jungwirth.
He said the Victoria had a tradition of
87 years that no alcoholic liquid should
be sold on the premises. “We would
rather profits remained as they are than
seek higher dividends and a breach of
principle. You will lose many old
friends,” he warned.
Oh, yes, the directors said the liquor
was just for serving in the restaurant,
so that they could compete with the
other hotels. There would be no public
bar and no liquor would be served in
the bedrooms. However, old hands like
us are sceptical. Once the demon gets
through the back door its frightful
influence will spread.
The tragic thing is that the Victoria
is the last of the great coffee palaces.
You must understand that the 1880 s
was a rich and beautiful temperance era
in Melbourne. The Government was
known as “the greatest moral show on
earth, ’ and we developed a passion for
turning vast hotels into coffee palaces.
We had the Victoria Coffee Palace, the
Grand Coffee Palace, St. Anne’s Coffee
Palace, and the Melbourne Coffee
Palace. Ah, but the Victoria was the
first of them all. The Victoria was
started by that rapacious land-boomer,
the Hon. James Munro in 1880. Munro
was the leader of the Temperance Party
and Premier from 1890 to 1892.
He was President of the Total
Abstinence Society and the Victorian
Alliance for the Suppression of the
Liquor Traffic. He was, according to
Michael Cannon in “The Land
Boomers,” also a committeeman of the
Toorak Presbyterian Church and the
Independent Order of Rechabites. With
much blowing of Presbyterian and Tem-
perance trumpets, the Victoria was
opened in 1880.
Very soon it was paying a steady and
splendid 10 percent; so was the other
coffee palace, the Melbourne, in Bourke
Street. Melbourne’s greatest hotel was
the Grand in Spring Street (now the
Windsor), built in 1884. In 1886, our
friend, the Hon. James, brought out a
prospectus, formed the Grand Coffee
Palace Company with a capital of
£250,000 with 50,000 shares at £5 each.
Here was a hotel, 154 bedrooms, with
six sitting-rooms and seven bathrooms.
The grand opening as a coffee
palace was one of those never-to-be-
forgotten moments in the history of
temperance. There was a great ban-
quet for distinguished citizens and
shareholders. The Hon. James Munro
was in the chair. On this day he wore
a Lock coat and in his buttonhole was
a blue ribbon, which indicated that he
was a member of the great interna-
tional movement of total abstainers. At
the climax of his speech, he paused.
With great solemnity he drew from his
top pocket a long piece of paper beside
his blue ribbon. Then he reached in his
pocket for a box of matches. “Well,
gentlemen,” said he, “this is what we
think of the liquor licence.” He put
the match to the licence and as it
burned there was clamorous hurst of
cheering right around the dining-room.
It is recorded in the official history
of the Windsor that as the liquor
licence burned “the anticipation of
good fortune for the lot of them went
up in smoke.” The next day the ads
announced the sale of tea, scones,
beef-tea, malt extract, and fresh milk.
However, in the full flush of victory
the Hon. James, along with another
famous temperance land-boomer, Little
Jimmy Mirams, was already raising
money for that unbelievable piece of
Victoriana, the Federal Coffee Palace,
the greatest, most exotic hotel Aus-
tralia had ever seen. It opened in time
for the Centennial Exhibition in 1888.
It had its own ice plant in the base-
ment, gas light on all floors, and even
electric bells. Over the doors were the
letters “Restez Ici” and “Soyez de
Bien Venu” with two massive females
each with one breast. They are still
there and many of us have always
thought it wasn’t a nice-looking Pres-
byterian situation. Anyway, both the
Federal and the Grand went into the
red in the ’nineties and began appealing
desperately for liquor licences. The
Federal became the Federal Hotel and
the Grand did not recover from the
burning of that licence until 1920, when
it refurnished as the Windsor. Your
correspondent doesn’t remember what
happened to the Melbourne, but it is
no longer there. Alas, St. Anne’s also
went the way of the others. It is now
owned by the Catholic Church and
is a girls’ hostel.
So you can appreciate the tragedy of
all this. The Victoria Coffee Palace was
our last hope. Where do we go now for
our blue ribbon security? Our hotels
now stay open until 10 p.m. Restaurant
licences go even later, and we have a
nightclub which has a licence until 3
a.m.
It has all happened in the past few
years. It is awful to have to tell you
that there are movies on Sundays, petrol
can be sold legally any hour of the
day or night, seven days a week. Why,
before the war, the granting of a licence
to a restaurant was something that
simply wasn’t done; now they all have
them.
But, worst of all, stripping has come
to Melbourne. There are topless go-go
shows in South Yarra and St. Kilda.
The Lido in Russell Street is also
featuring topless girls. This used to be
a decent town. Just to give you an
example, two years ago a bus company
started a special for tired businessmen.
They drove to Sydney, saw all the strip
joints at the Cross, and then returned
in time for work again on Monday
morning.
This no longer operates and we hear
that N.S.W.’s Chief Secretary has been
cleaning up the Cross. Don’t you see
what will happen? Soon a Sydney bus
service will be running executive bus
trips to see the sin in Melbourne.

Cardin, All
Among the
Wool Boys
THE AIR-CONDITIONING may
have had something to do with it, but
it was our distinct impression on arrival
at the Australian Wool Board's 7th-
floor office in Sydney that Pierre
Card in’s heart, covered thickly with
layers of pink shirt, grey flannel waist-
coat and double-breasted jacket, was
not really in his conference with the
young Australian designers.
Afterwards a lady from the Wool
Board apologised for the heat, and said
wait till they were in their new office
on the 37th floor in Australia Square,
there would be lots of lovely air-
conditioning. (We will have to wait
a long time: next day the AWB said
they were already in their new office
in George Street, what on earth was
she talking about?)
The Master, despite two sun-baking
sojourns to Bondi Beach, a stone's
throw from his hotel, retained a white
complexion (unlike his business part-
ner, Monsieur Oliver, who showed
signs of peeling at the edges). Except-
ing Trent Nathan, the young Australian
designers all shared a similar pallor
that we supposed came from dedica-
tion to their profession and this was
accentuated by heavy eye make-up
one girl had a heart-shaped beauty
spot and their colorful choice of
clothes for this historical meeting. Miss
Pat Benson, who works for Mr. Nathan,
wore an amazing four-tiered off-the-
shoulder dress in purple with green
spots. Mr. Nathan himself wore a
Pierre Cardin-ish high-buttoned jacket.
Monsieur Cardin spoke pretty good
English, but had difficulty understand-
ing other people’s. This led to frequent
misunderstanding, followed by long,
edgy pauses until Mademoiselle
Micheline Fried from the French Inter-
national Wool Fashion Office could be
found to interpret for him.
A (by comparison) spirited exchange
took place when his male model
bounded in wearing the New Cardin
Look for Men: a pale grey Space Age
romper suit tucked into silver ankle-
length gurnboots and fastened with a
vicious-looking silver zip.

worn?” asked one young designer. “Is it
for casual wear?”
“Why that you don’t like it?”
responded Monsieur Cardin rather
aggressively. “Ho, I see. You like the
tie and collar and,” with a shade of
scorn, “if you are not ready for change
you don’t like. If you cannot advance
it is not good.”
Well, did Mr. Cardin think zips were
the next in-thing for men? “Why else
my name becoming so strong in the
country? Because people likes all the
idea. If they don’t like, I am not here
in Australia. If you like my fashion you
wear it.” Zips for Mr. Cardin? “For
me? But I am old man —but, of course,
in the country for casual I wear. When
you go to the beach you do not wear
evening dress. When you go to the bath
you do not wear bathing dress, huh?”
This was followed by another diffi-
cult moment when Monsieur Cardin
unzipped the back of a dress with
built-in silver metal necklace and brace-
lets to reveal a naked girl. Did M.
Cardin not believe in underwear?
“Underwear? What is ze underwear?
Un-der-where. What does this mean?”
It transpired he did not disbelieve in
it, but actually couldn’t be bothered to
put his girls in it when changing for a
fashion show.
The couturier then sent for his cos-
tume classique, but a voice in the next
room whispered it had not been packed.
He disappeared to check. In the break
a public-relations man said he didn’t
know if any of the young designers
wanted to get stuck into Mr. Cardin?
Yes, said Mr. Nathan, he did—well, he
might have five minutes after. No, said
a public-relations lady sharply, it
should be thrown open for general con-
versation.
And so it was, beginning with the
girl in purple and green spots inquiring
if Mr. Cardin designed something too
way-out for his clients, would he hold
back—that is, not put it into produc-
tion? No, he never held back. Oh,
fabulous, breathed Miss Benson. Well,
said Mr. Cardin, if you are not creating
you are not exciting. If you are not
exciting, you are normal. Miss Benson
groaned. Oh, God, she didn’t feel nor-
mal. Her difficulty was everyone else
did. And why does Mr. Cardin restrict
his production to one showing twice a
year? asked Mr. Nathan, who shows
four times. Because, said the interpreter
severely, it icosts 120 million francs,
that’s why. Just tot that up and see
what it would work out to.
Cardin exited quickly into the next-
door office. We followed, our hopes of
animated conversation with him not
too high, and discovered that (1)
he really designs for his good friends
the Press, (2) he thinks Coco Chanel
an old, stupid woman, (3) Australian
designers are delightful, (4) Australia
is very nice, (5) he has travelled
everywhere in the world, (6) Italy is
his favorite place and (7) he cant
wait to get there . . .

SPORT
Twilight
of the
Olympics
THIS COLUMN CLOSED for repairs
some two years ago after a lone appeal
for commonsense in deciding the size of
our 1964 Olympic Games team, which
seemed more suitable to a nation of 50
million. Now the Australian Olympic
Federation itself has asked for the 1968
team to be more in keeping with our
numbers and abilities.
The Olympic giant’s ankles may not
know it, or show it, but the organism
is sick and the Olympic Games are
doomed. The diagnosis: dinosaurism.
Prognosis: a lingering but certain death.
The original Olympic Games were a
fine idea in tribal Greece, BC. But
when Baron de Coubertin moved to
revive the Olympics in AD 1896 his
timing could not have been worse, nor
the world further from the Golden Age
of Greece which motivated him.
Thirteen nations tested his theories at
Athens in 1896. By 1936 there were
nearly 50 nations competing at Berlin.
Post-Hitler, and three Olympiads later,
the world gave it another try when
nearly 60 nations sent 4500 people to
London. Next year about 120 nations
will send more than 10,000 to Mexico
City, and by 1976 the affair will have
become so big that few nations outside
the U.S. and U.S.S.R. (and no develop-
ing nation) will be able to afford the
gamble of staging an Olympic Games.
The concept has already degenerated
into a huge financial risk for any City
Government, a gamble which a turn of
international cards might convert to a
loss that Games prestige would suffer,
too. We hear that 16 U.S. cities will
bid for the 1976 Games—but how many
elsewhere?
A legacy from the past (the Olympic
scene is littered with them) makes the
gamble riskier. From Los Angeles,
1932, we have the notion that Olympic
athletes cannot be billeted but must
have a satellite village built for them,
enabling them to mix freely. (Rome
added the fences to prevent the sexes
mixing too freely.)
Baron de Coubertin’s ideal was a
gathering “unmindful of national
rivalries, jealousies, and indifferences.”
The nations’ response was to keep an
unofficial points score by which,
since 1952, the Games have become a
U.S.S.R. v. U.S. struggle, presumably
to prove whose “thought” grows better
muscles. Yet to come, the Africa-Asia-
West struggle.
Consider the “amateur” aspect of
the Games, to be tested as never before
at Mexico City, 7000 feet up, in rare-
fied air. The International Olympic
Committee has allowed a four weeks’
acclimation in the home countries. This
rule is already being broken in most
countries which can set up training
camps at that altitude. It will cruelly
affect the chances of competitors from
lowland areas who, for one reason or
another, cannot manage acclimation—
perhaps half the 1968 competitors.
And, finally, how modern are the
Modern Olympics these gigantic
four-yearly Olympic circuses which in-
clude contests on horses, ice-skates,
skis, and bicycles, in sailboats, canoes
and kayaks; but not in, on, or with
anything more mechanised than a fire-
arm?
If testing human strength and endur-
ance is the factor, why horses, why
sailing boats, why pistols? We are not
so much questioning the validity of
these individually as wondering about
the general validity of a sacred Dino
known as the Olympic Games.
It must seem to many as it seems
to us, that if this lumbering fossil ever
had any value, it has passed: that today
the Olympic beast sits too heavily on
world amateur sport and smothers its
progress: that it would be preferable
for, as economists put it, the more
viable sports to offer a superior god to
their young aspirants.
The present offer might be vocalised
as, “You have won the right to rep-
resent your country at the Olympics.
Go join 10,000 sailors, weight-lifters,
Graeco-Roman wrestlers, pistol-shooters,
horse-riders, ice-skaters, and even a
few of your own sport, in a short,
sharp orgy of international rivalry
which will make a better man or woman
of you. Don’t steal any radios. Swear
to march only when the manager lets
you.”
World amateur sport would be much
better served if the individual sports
each held their own world champion-
ships, yearly, in a chosen city especi-
ally hospitable to that sport and
equipped to stage the titles without im-
possible strain. In this, athletes would
see more of the world, and more of
the world would see championship
athletic meets of various kinds; even
the poorest parts of the world. And no
champion-to-be, anywhere, would have
to wait four years, and perhaps pass his
peak, before getting at least one crack
at the world title for his event, in his
sport.
There is already a Winter Olympics,
usually held on the other side of the
world from the main Games but con-
sidered a part of it. This separation
does not seem to harm the Olympic
image. To break down the giant gradu-
ally, we suggest, for a beginning, annual
Track and Field, Aquatic, Stadium, etc.,
Olympics before final separation into
individual sports.

MASTER
Wine of the Month:
A Ministerial
Favorite
MY MARINATED FRIEND Mr.
Graham Kerr says, “When in doubt,
choose a White Burgundy.” In-fact, I
believe that it is his favorite wine. He
points out that it is a white wine so
full of flavor yet so smooth in style
that it can be enjoyed with almost any
foodstuff. Indeed, I have just returned
from a dinner of beef-rolls in beer and
we chose a White Burgundy to accom-
pany it, which it did in a most Good
Companionable way.
Some time ago I wrote about White
Burgundies and mentioned that Hough-
tons was a ministerial favorite. And
more than one minister, for I can
remember serving it to General Nasu-
tion some years ago, and I recollect
that he liked it very much. He has since
gone on to other things.
Anyway, the Houghtons White Bur-
gundy is my Wine-of-the-Month. It is
made chiefly from Semilion with a
slight Tokay additive. The grapes are
grown on sandy loam soil, the Marri
country of the Swan Valley, and are
picked when very ripe. There is no rain
after Christmas in that country, and
during the ripening period tempera-
tures are often maintained at 105
degrees F. The grapes are picked in
late February or early March and have
a most emphatic Australian character.
You can almost hear the pupils in a
wine-appreciation course reciting “I
love a sunburnt White Burgundy.”
The resulting wine is big and rich
and round and full-flavored. Max Lake
describes the “powerful honey and spice
bouquet, full golden color with an
occasional tinge of green, soft rich flavor
. . .” and I can’t put it better. What is
more, there is plenty of it—about 30,000
gallons a year. Once upon a time this
was enough for the whole of Australia,
but year for the first time the wine
was rationed and eventually was
unavailable for three months.
It was for many years the only
White Burgundy in Australia, being
first vintaged in 1937. It was called a
White Burgundy because of its obvious
affinity to the big round wines of the
Cote de Beaune and the so-called Cote
de Mersault, in the Bourgogne area
of France. And though today there are
many other styles of White Burgundy,
it is still probably the most distinctive.
Many of the following wines are
lighter, perhaps even crisper, and do
not have the same suggestion of sweet-
ness, yet there is no or very little sugar
in the wine. The impression of sweet-
ness comes from its rich full flavor
and low acid content.
Houghtons White Burgundy is a
wine of great character and is made
by a winemaker of great character.
Jack Mann has entertained, enlightened,
and exasperated thousands of wine-
lovers through the years. His father,
George, started at Houghtons in 1910.
Jack joined him in 1922 and took over
completely as winemaker in 1930.
That makes this year’s vintage his
46th.
Houghtons has a history going back
to 1832 when an Indian army colonel
of the same name regimented the first
vines. The Fergusons took over in
1859 and held the land for many
years, the Emu Wine Company buying
it out in 1951.,
One sometimes feels that Jack, being
of a conservative nature, is not too
sure about the new regime as yet. Once
he makes his mind up, he never changes
it. He is an avid Western Australian
and, like the Cornishmen who talk of
their visit to England, he shudders at
the thought of ever seeing the rest of
Australia. He once went to South Aus-
tralia, but cut his visit short. “I just
couldn’t stand the pace.”
His White Burgundy undoubtedly
gets much of its full, richness from the
ripeness of the grapes. Jack always
picks at 15 degrees Beaume or over.
Not for him the ethereal delicate
whites, though he does deplore harsh
treatment of material. A power-that-
was once sent him a Whitehill Crusher.
Jack disliked the machine and refused
to use it. This correspondence ensued:
“How’s the Whitehill Crusher?”
“As good as the day it arrived!”
Eventually, when Jack was compelled
to use the Crusher, he labelled his
White Burgundies with the mysterious
initials W.C. He now uses a different
mill.
Jack is often slightly outraged at his
reputation. “They say I’ve never been
a beer drinker! That’s not true. I
tasted it once! The only trouble with
Western Australia is the water. We have
to purify it with a little Chablis.”
He lives in a house by the winery,
surrounded by his large indulgent
family, subscribing to his three loves,
Chablis, Christianity, and Cricket.
(One of his sons, Dorham, is a State
Government viticulturist and another,
Tony, leg-spins for the Western Aus-
tralian cricket team.) He is a magnifi-
cent host, and his wife, Angela, can cook
a splendid meal in entirety from their
own garden and produce.
His favorite remark about wine,
repeated at the slightest provocation,
is:
“It should be Glowing with life,
Blessed with refinement,
Adorned with flavor.”
The world of Jack Mann could be
described in the same terms.


MARLEY
TO THE
RESCUE..
Modern industry must have water to survive. Millions
of gallons of it. An endless flow of pure fresh water,
every hour, every day. But surely all this water must
run out sometime? That's where Marley comes to the
rescue. Marley Cooling Towers throughout Australia
are saving water for industry. Water that can be
re-used ove.r and over again. In fact the figure is a
staggering 2.5 million gallons saved per minute. That's
a lot of water. And that's one more reason you should
look to Email-Marley for <your next cooling tower.

The End of
Do-it-yourself?
IT is to be hoped that the news
that Mr. Holt has bought a
couple of aides will be followed by
more and more adaptations of
government to the particular
stresses of our times.
The idea that a Prime Minister
can do it all himself is quite alien
to contemporary experience. If a
Prime Minister —or any of the
other busy Ministers - attempts
to be a one-man band, it usually
means that he confines himself
only to crisis and to the routine.
He leaves undone that forward
thinking toward the future shapes
of problems and the future uses of
government that represent Aus-
tralia’s greatest single political
need.
Mr. Holt’s modest appoint-
ments may do little more than
help clear his desk and get a few
new things going. However, he
should be pleased by the reaction
to his first step in introducing a
more contemporary style into
Australian government. A few
years ago the narrow-minded
would have attacked him for
extravagance, just as a few years
ago they might have attacked him
for his recognition that he has to
go on showing his face in the
nations of Asia. Perhaps Aus-
tralia’s do-it-yourself days are
ending. ' ' *
In this it is important that the
Prime Minister should set an
example. If he sets a more con-
temporary style, this strengthens
the hands of others in the
bureaucracies of business and
government. Perhaps setting an
example in style is the greatest
single use of a Prime Minister: if
he looks toward the future he is
likely to strengthen the gaze of
others. Good speeches can some-
times have more profound (if
immeasurable) effects than legis-
lation. Here there is still little
sign that Mr. Holt is learning to
get beyond the habits that made
him one of the good chaps in
Parliament the backslapper’s
smile and the ability to gabble on
without saying anything very
much.
He needs something more than
a good speech-writer or two,
although he certainly needs them,
What he needs is the knack of
drawing out of intellectuals,
within his own bureaucracies and
outside them, their conceptions of
what Australia should now be
about. In a sense the real problem
of Australian politicians is that
they have to find new functions,
and a new rhetoric and new
ideals. Without this, most of them
will go on appearing as awful to
the electorate as they now do.
What most dangerously slows
down change in Australian
politics is our continuance of the
system of appointing Ministers
only from Parliament. This can
work well for the House of Com-
mons, which is the kind of place
in which able men can fill in their
time congenially while waiting for
office, but servitude in the Aus-
tralian Parliament is not so
attractive to able men. Very few
Australians would oppose a change
to a system in which a Prime
Minister would form his cabinet
from whatever talent was available.-
Except Members of Parliament.

Brave Words, Little Action
From ALAN REID in Canberra
On June 22, 1965, addressing the Newcastle Workers’ Club, Opposition Leader
Gough Whitlam advocated disaffiliating unions with executives hostile to the ALP.
The Boonaroo-Jeparit incidents demonstrate why such action is necessary not only
from the ALP’s viewpoint but from the wider aspects of national interest.
Boonaroo and Jeparit are Australian
National Line ships. The Government
wants to use them to take supplies, in-
cluding military supplies, to Australian
troops fighting in Vietnam. The Sea-
men’s Union is prepared to take the
ships only if they carry non-military
supplies.
Or, to put it in the simple, homely
language reported to have been used
by William McDonald, Secretary of the
Marine Stewards, across the table at
an ACTU conference to E. V. Elliott,
of the Seamen’s Union, “the seamen
are prepared to take Christmas pudding
and hampers to the troops in Vietnam
—at penalty rates but you are not
prepared to give them the means to see
they are alive to eat them.”
Labor has recognised the principle
involved. Though an implacable oppon-
ent of the war in Vietnam, former
Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell, in
a speech subsequently endorsed by an
ALP Federal Conference, addressed the
Australian servicemen in Vietnam dir-
ectly from the floor of Parliament. He
said, “In terms of everything that
an army in the field requires, we shall
never deny you the aid and support
that it is your right to expect in the
service of your country.” These were
brave words, but when the test came
Labor was lacking in its duty.
Though the ACTU, which Labor
regards as its industrial wing, courage-
ously made a decision which amounted
to an instruction to the Seamen’s Union
to take military supplies to Vietnam in
the Boonaroo, Labor maintained a
frightened silence until Mr. Whitlam
was provoked into interjecting across
the chamber of the Representatives that
Labor had not changed its policy from
that enunciated by Mr. Calwell.
Some academics believe that Com-
munist influence upon the Labor Party
is overestimated. They claim 10 detect
few examples of how Labor policy has
been moulded by Communist pressures.
But what the academics overlook is the
effectiveness of the Communists in per-
suading the ALP not to give its backing
to those sections of Labor policy which
could damage or lessen Communist
power within the unions.
It is worthwhile looking at how
Communist influence has been exerted
in the Boonaroo-Jeparit incidents in
such a manner as to thwart successfully
aid of a realistic kind being given by
the ALP to uphold the authority of
the ACTU. It is almost a classical
case of how that influence is exerted.
Though it supports the Communist
Party enthusiastically and publicly at
election times, the Seamen’s Union is
affiliated with the Victorian ALP,
power base of the Communist-influ-
enced section of the Labor Party.
A man who played a large part in
the Seamen’s decision not to man ships
carrying military supplies to Vietnam
is Mr. B. Nolan, Victorian secretary of
the Seamen’s Union. Mr. Nolan is a
member of the State ALP executive.
On Friday nights, Mr. Nolan sits
at the Victorian ALP executive table
with Mr. Calwell and Dr. Jim Cairns,
both prominent Labor parliamentary
leaders. On one occasion recently Mr.
Whitlam in his new role as Opposition
Leader sat at that table and undoubt-
edly listened to news that either came
to him directly from Nolan or from
those influenced by him.
For the rest of the week, Mr. Nolan
sits at conference tables with Mr.
Elliott, who, in 1952 (in the Seamen’s
Journal of March of that year), made
the proud boast that he had kept fellow
Australians short of supplies needed for
their military protection. Addressing a
Berlin meeting of the World Federa-
tion of Trade Unions, Elliott said: “No
Australian ship has taken troops or
supplies from Australia to Korea (dur-
ing the Korean War) and the Govern-
ment has been forced to use Air Force
planes for this purpose.”
Take a look at what happens. If
the Seamen’s Union attitude is con-
demned by the ALP parliamentary
leaders, Mr. Nolan is attacked. But he
sits on the same ALP executive as Mr.
Calwell and Dr. Cairns. It would be
all very embarrassing for everyone "if
Labor tried to live up to the Calwel-
lian assurance to servicemen.
So, Australian Navy crews, some of
whom have already done service in
Vietnamese waters, have their leave
cancelled so that they can take to Viet-
nam ships that Seamen’s Union mem-
bers should take; the ACTU is left with
no more public support than a minor
interjection in Parliament by Mr.
Whitlam; and the academics continue
to insist that there is no discernible
Communist influence upon the Labor
Party.
No wonder Mr. Whitlam told his
1965 audience that unless Labor was
prepared to acquiesce in the political
subversion of the Labor Party it had
no alternative .to disaffiliating unions
with executives hostile to the ALP.
Seamen's E. V. Elliott
Atomic Energy
As co-discoverer of the element plu-
tonium, Dr. Glenn Seaborg, chairman
of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, seemed entitled on his recent visit
here to toss about some drastic ideas
on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy
for Australia.
The ideas were not unfamiliar to the
AAEC men at Lucas Heights nor to
anybody who has been following the
research programs of the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission, but as they en-
visage “open air” as well as under-
ground nuclear explosions they raise
acute questions for an unsuspecting
public.
What sort of things have the nuclear
men in mind? To start with, they say
it would be feasible to blast a canal
from the sea to the Hamersley iron-
ore project in W.A. Seaborg said the
U.S. had the right atomic explosives
to do the job and that planning for the
underground operations involved could
be initiated at once. The job itself
couldn’t start until the necessary modi-
fications were made to the limited
nuclear test ban to which Australia
subscribed, he admitted: and the
climate of public opinion would have
to be favorable.
Other possibilities for open-air ex-
plosions include the formation of deep
craters, rubble chimneys, dams, and
new harbors, but at this stage atomic
scientists concede that radioactivity
would at present limit their use to areas
where population densities are very low,
as in the north of Australia.
Some of the other projected peace-
ful uses of nuclear energy: to stimulate
the recovery of natural gas from tight
deep rock formations and to create
underground storage reservoirs near the
big consumption areas to meet peak
demands for gas. In the U.S. an experi-
mental explosion “Project Gasbuggy”
is planned for a gas field next year,
and approval has been sought for two
more.
The other projects in the “Plow-
share” program include one to develop
a technique for fracturing copper-ore
bodies, which the U.S. Commission
thinks holds promise for metal recovery


from low-grade ores whose mining by
conventional methods is uneconomic.
Progress in the program has been
slowed somewhat by the Limited Nu-
clear Test Ban Treaty, which is aimed
primarily at limiting atmospheric con-
tamination from testing nuclear weap-
ons. Deeply buried, fully contained
explosion tests can be carried out, but
there are restrictions on cratering-type
explosions.
There’s a growing interest, particu-
larly in minerals circles, in the pos-
sibilities of Plowshare-type experiments
being carried out here. The AAEC is
convinced that, in time, the peaceful
uses of nuclear explosives could find a
specialised but very important role in
the development of the natural
resources of Australia.
Ice Scramble
Not so long ago, ice-cream was some-
thing that you bought in a milk bar;
nowadays by far the greater part of
Australian ice-cream sales are through
supermarkets in cut-price bulk £ gallon
cans that were seldom seen three or
four years ago.
And people are buying so much
more of it. In the past three years,
Australian ice-cream consumption has
gone up by more than 50 percent. But
the jump in sales has not brought any
prosperity to the ice-cream companies.
The ice-cream war has seen some of
the most violent retail battles of recent
times.
The war began in earnest when
British Tobacco (the W. D. and H. O.
Wills cigarette companyj decided to
protect itself by diversifying into other
activities, one of them ice-cream.
Already there were signs that a
battle was brewing as smaller operators
had moved in under the guard of the
big producers of that time Peters
and Unilever and began to promote
their products.
Devondale Cream Pty. Ltd., the
company which had cracked the N.S.W.
Milk Board’s cream market in 1960,
in Sydney, by knocking the cream price
down from 3s. 7Jd. a half pint to
2s. 6d., also pioneered the move into
grocery and supermarket outlets for
ice-cream in N.S.W. After winning the
cream battle by 1961, Devondale began
ice-cream manufacture in Sydney, from
Victorian cream, and eventually was
sending ice-cream back to the Victorian
market by road.
But the recent assault by British
Tobacco has been the main reason for
the latest round of cut-throat pricing
(and it is an assault that has cost British
Tobacco quite a lot of money).
Half-gallon cans of its ice-cream sell
for as little as 35 cents in some super-
markets compared with prices around
90 cents for old-established brands in
the milk bars.
British Tobacco’s own brands are
Frozo, Sunkist, and Diamond (in West-
ern Australia), but it also has a big
shareholding interest in Toppa (in Vic-
toria) and Devondale (which was
brought closer to the fold last week in
the big loan deal and a national pro-
duction agreement under which Toppa
will make for Devondale in Victoria,
and vice versa in N.S.W.).
But the old-established makers have
replied very strongly. Unilever added
Jerseymaid to its Streets and McNivens
brands; Peters has Penguin, Buttercup,
Victor, and Alaska; and Dairy Farmers
added Golden Valley as its cheaper
brand.
But there are other brands in Coles’
and Woolworths’ supermarkets also
battling it out and they are made
especially for the retailers by various
producers. So Toppa and Devondale
make Farmland ice-cream for Coles,
and Sunnybrook makes Flavourjoy for
Woolworths.
But the war has not ended there.
Now the big makers are fighting a
new battle on the flavored ice (less
than 10 percent butterfat) front.
British Tobacco’s brand is Swerl,
Devondale’s is Devon Dip, Sunny-
brook’s is Scoop, Peters is Countdown,
Toppa’s is Country Club, and Streets
is Dairy Dessert.

Tight Fisted
There are good grounds for saying
that the Commonwealth is being tight
fisted with research money. This is
especially so in relation to its general
research grants. In the three-year pro-
gram just ended, the universities got $6
million, and for the triennium begin-
ning this year it has been kept at $6
million. Hence the protests, especially
Victoria’s.
However, there are other sources of
research money and these are increas-
ing. There is a 35 percent increase in
the general recurrent grants to uni-
versities and a proportionate increase
in research money fom general uni-
versity budgets. The universities are
committed to maintaining this propor-
tion.
Under present arrangements, the
Commonwealth shares with the States
the responsibility for raising research
money on a $ for $ basis. As a com-
promise, however, the Commonwealth
early this year offered to take over
entirely the more expensive Australian
Research Grants Committee program
of project grants if the States will look
after the united general grants.
This proposal would mean the Com-
monwealth was contributing $9 million
to research this triennium against $5
million last time apart from its con-
tribution through general university fin-
ancial assistance. Senator Gorton’s
offer might have been expected to be
eagerly grasped by the States. It saves
them $2.5 million after all. Indeed,
W.A., S.A., and Queensland have
accepted it and Tasmania probably will
come along. Led by Sir Henry Bolte,
Victoria and N.S.W. have, however,
continued their noisy battling.
Possibly the Victorian Premier hopes
to make the Commonwealth the scape-
goat in the affair, especially as he faces
an election soon. He may hope to
squeeze yet another concession out of
the Commonwealth.
One unfortunate fact being over-
looked in this devious and noisy poker
game is that the limited funds avail-
able are being redirected. The Research
Grants Committee money, expanding
under Commonwealth patronage, goes
almost entirely to senior university
people. The squeeze is on the post-
graduate students the Ph.D and
Masters candidates who rely on the
State-financed general research grants.
That is where a possible new brain
drain could arise.
The research dispute is, however,
only one of several which are likely to
come up in the future. Later this year
there is certain to be a big clash over
university salaries. The Federation of
Australian University Staff Associa-
tions has a claim in with the Uni-
versities Commission for academic pay
rises from 11 to 14 percent. There has
been no rise since the beginning of
1964, when a 10 percent rise was
granted.
Members of the Universities Com-
mission and Senator Gorton, Minister
Senator Gorton
for Education, all agree that the present
claim is a modest one and believe it
should be granted. But they anticipate
strong opposition from the State Gov-
ernments and might let the States take
the full opprobrium for refusing to pay
their share.
Meanwhile, the Commonwealth is
steadily moving more deeply into other
fields of education. Annual grants for
science laboratories go up from $lO
million to $12.5 million, and within
four years the Commonwealth should
have science-teaching facilities up to
what it regards as an acceptable stand-
ard. Its similar $l2 million annual
grants for technical school building may
have to go on into the middle of next
decade, but they, too, will tail off after
that.
The Commonwealth’s involvement
with teacher training is likely to grow.
In the next three years with Common-
wealth money the number of places in
teacher training colleges will increase
by more than 50 percent, and 1973
should see the completion of this pro-
gram.
The new Colleges of Advanced
Education will probably take until the
1980 s to build up. There are plenty of
new fields for the Commonwealth to
enter and Commonwealth officials talk
freely about them—library facilities at
all levels, educational TV, and, of
course, State aid to independent schools.
Meanwhile, with financial burdens
the Commonwealth will be demanding
corresponding influence. People in
the Department of Education have
plenty of ideas about how State educa-
tion systems should be reformed—one
senior official will be pushing to have
teacher training made independent of
the State Education Departments, for
instance.

lennis liii
Many sports organisations throughout
Australia envy those in the “lucky”
State, New South Wales.
There licensed clubs and their poker
machines can provide the money for
everything from a headquarters build-
ing to keeping the sport alive in lean
years.
N.S.W. tennis has been a notable
standout, so when the State’s LTA
admitted last week that it was ljving
hand to mouth and decided to levy its
48,000 members 50 cents to $1 each,
it was natural to wonder why.
The LTA in New South Wales has
its headquarters and championship
courts at White City, below Kings
Cross, and for many years has been
trying to erect a prestige clubhouse
there with the idea of getting a liquor
licence and the bonanza poker
machines from which great profits
could flow for the good of tennis
generally.
In one of those “who’s in charge”
disputes which plague so many amateur
sports, the White City ground members
got a liquor licence for their club, but
had to move and rebuild nearby, out-
side the grounds, where it reopens in
some grandeur this week.
The LTA committee, having proved
it was “in charge,” has sold some
ground to Sydney Grammar School,
and leased some to Ampol for a service
station, but with tennis in N.S.W. show-
ing an administrative loss of $2OOO a
month, the committee needs a miracle
to start on the $BO,OOO clubhouse which
must replace the present rambling
White City structure before a licence
can be secured.
It is still possible that the LTA com-
mittee, having changed its mind about
“open” tennis, may unbend further
and give in to its White City ground
members, who have offered to lease all
but the centre courts, release other
courts when needed for championships,
and share their clubhouse and profits.
Obscene Art
Victoria seems in danger of losing its
laurels as the banning State after last
week’s “obscene art” case.
Victorian artist Ronald Upton’s
painting “Oops” was found obscene
within the meaning of the 1964 Police
Offences Act in Victoria, but a charge
that he had assisted in its exhibition
was dismissed by Mr. Smith, SM, in
whose opinion “Oops” was not obscene
in its context as part of an art-gallery
exhibition.
Unlike the Chief Secretary, Mr.
Rylah, who once judged a book on
“teenage daughter” standards, Mr.
Smith was satisfied that “people who
attended such exhibitions (as Upton’s)
were those who had a great knowledge
and interest in art.”
In the setting, Mr. Smith could not
say that the painting would tend to
deprave or corrupt people attending
the gallery or their children.
In a similar case in Sydney, artist
Michael Brown, having appealed
against a December sentence of three
months’ hard labor for delivering an
indecent painting, is due to appear
again on March 13 on an “exhibiting
obsence paintings” charge. His solici-
tor may seek an adjournment until the
appeal has been heard.
Meanwhile 34 fellow artists donated
40 paintings to raise funds for Brown’s
defence, and sales and donations have
brought in a total of more than $l3OO.

The National RQISBS has a 17/sl 7 /s i.p.s.
speed for dictation, plus a faster 3 3 4 speed
for finer musical effects.
And when headphones aren’t being used,
sound pours forth from a large 6" cabinet
speaker, not a tiny one in the mike. The
National plays longer, too. Its “auto-
reverse” gives 3 hours’ playing time, so it’s
ideal for meetings or long play classics
sessions at home. And when you’re dictat-
ing, you can switch to “auto-voice” to
capture your words and not your pauses.
So why lavish more on a 1-speed dictating
machine? $189.95 buys you a National 2-
speed, 9 transistor RQISBS tape recorder,
that does much more.

Going Down in the West
The Liberal Party’s Perth division on
March 14 will try group therapy on a
sickness that has been building up for
many months.
. The divisional conference agenda, the
notice paper tells delegates, “will be
confined to discussion on general
matters of Party policy, including the
Party image. Priority will be given to
hearing delegates’ views on these sub-
jects . . . This is an important meeting.”
The State Liberal Party’s weaknesses
became apparent even to its most stub-
born apologists before the Federal elec-''
tion, when campaigning candidates had
to fight off attacks on issues that were
not in their territory but were strictly
State affairs. This was reflected in the
election figures; the West was the only
State not to swing toward the Liberals.
The statistics showed that the voting-
had gone hardest against the sitting
Government Members only in safe seats.
This was read as a measure of the
Western Australian voter’s discernment:
he expressed his token anger at such
slights as the Commonwealth’s rejection
of the Old, but where it really mattered
—in the marginal seats —he voted pro-
Government.
This complacency is all the more
misguided in view of the hammering
the State Government took in the last
session of Parliament. The ffabby-
mindedness that has followed undoubted
successes in mining and industrial
enterprises prompted the Government,
acting upon the advice of its public ser-
vice, to take on groups who have
traditionally been sympathetic to
Liberal ideals.
At the last session of Parliament,
several Bills were defeated or diluted
by back-bench rebellions, and this
reflected badly on the State Premier,
Mr. David Brand, who has been the
leaven in the Liberal bread over the
past 15 years or so. In many ways he
has been a copybook Premier, with a
demeanor and charm that has nicely
balanced the big-business image built
up by Mr. Charles Court in his
relentless and successful quest after
industrial development.
Shielded from the shake-outs that
changes of Government bring, the
State’s bureaucrats have been having
a field day. Swashbuckling public ser-
vants, for example, are despoiling
Perth’s No. 1 natural asset, the Swan
River. They have yet to admit that
another 100 acres of river will be
alienated to the freeways, whose
expense grows in proportion to their
ugliness, forcing the Government to
postpone their completion until more
money becomes available.
Mr. Brand has been a now-dis-
illusioned scapegoat for this slow and
painful grinding of government that
touches the man in the street, at the
same time being left far behind Mr.
Court as he reaps the glory of the
State’s shop-front progress. The State
Government has been compared with
a board of directors, blithely running
the place with the minimum deference
to the shareholders.
Behind it all lies breakdown in com-
munications. The Liberal Party’s
organisational hand has never been
allowed to know what the parlia-
mentary hand will do next (it reached
a point at one stage where a State
President and a State Premier did not
speak to each other). Simultaneously,
the public service is taking a stronger
grip on the reins of government and
drawing away from the people; and the
Government, in turn, is finding it more
and more comfortable to keep the
people at arm’s length.
Money, and a resolve to spend it in
a politically expedient way, could
swing things between now and the next
State election. But this money is not
available, so the Government will find
it hard to hit upon some action that
will bring the voters back. The State,
with a rather Texan swagger, is
anxious to tell how well it is pro-
gressing yet, sadly, Western Aus-
tralians themselves are not fired with
the same enthusiasm. The Government
has everything to gain from laying a
few more cards on the table.
Tourist Draw
Other rocks than Ayers are luring
American tourists to Australia, and the
founder of the Lapidary Club move-
ment here, Jack Taylor, says it is time
our tourism boffins realised it.
As a “for instance,” he points to a
coming visit by 71 members of an
Alaskan gem and mineral club, who will
arrive in two contingents in April and
June to gem-hunt, in air-conditioned
coaches, from Sydney to Rockhampton.
Only one tiny facet of the several
hundred thousand rock-hunters in
North America, the Alaskans scanned
“visit Australia” ads in vain, finding no
mention of their interest among the
aboroo posters we spread abroad, and
eventually found Jack Taylor by letter
and by chance.
Taylor, blunt and direct, suggests that
our tourism people take the Alaskans
aside, discover the address of their
movement’s national magazine, and
insert some ads in it, showing the wide
range of Australian gem stones.
Visiting Americans will find around
125 lapidary clubs in Australia, with
some 12,000 members so far. As the
movement grows, many country shows
are including competitive sections for
lapidarists in their annual exhibitions.
Sydney’s Royal Easter has not gone so
far, but now has & gem-stone display
among the arts and crafts, a move likely
to be followed in other cities.
“For fun, and. rarely for profit” is
the rock-hunter’s capsule explanation of
his hobby’s attraction, which includes
not only the outdoor search but the
workshop skill of cutting, grinding,
polishing, and mounting. The profit,
says Jack Taylor, could be tourism’s.


INDONESIA
By DONALD HORNE
WE were sitting in the anony-
mously smart gloom of the
Ramayana Bar, red furnishings
glowing softly in the light against the
black. We might have been anywhere
in international hotel-land, but we were
in the Hotel Indonesia. The English
businessman was telling me that he was
in Djakarta for five days. That would
give him enough time, he said, to report
on its economic potential.
A drink later, having been in Djakarta
for one day, he already seemed pre-
pared to sum up. “This country is boom-
ing,” he told me, as he reached for
another peanut. “There’s a great poten-
tial here. Look at all these new build-
ings they’ve put up.”
I got out of the air-conditioning into
the warmth of mid-afternoon. Motor-
scooters, Holdens, trishaws, jeeps,
lorries, and Army tanks seemed to be
reticulatirjg in the roundabout like dirty
water in a fountain. A few contem-
porary-style buildings (mostly foreign-
built) stuck up above the red-tiled roofs
and the scruffy paddocks. One of them
a Sukarno fantasy was dead, still-
born, a black skeleton of steel.
I walked along the potholed pave-
ment of the wide boulevard that
Sukarno had wanted to turn into his
East-West axis. Drivers were washing
their trishaw wheels in puddles of mud.
The department store rose from the
dust of what looked like a cattleyard,
most of its floors empty. And beyond
was the big paddock, marked “Freedom
Square” on the map, tufty with unkempt
grass and weeds. Monuments rose from
other paddocks, topped by statuary that
looked as if it had been designed by the
art director of a boys’ adventure maga-
zine. How could even an Englishman,
who was summing up Indonesia’s econo-
mic potential on a five-day visit, be so
looney as to find metaphors of national
enterprise among this rubbish? I saw a
note of the old currency lying near one
of the puddles. Nobody had bothered
to pick it up. It was a leftover from
Sukarno’s great spending carnival.
The Muslim New Year was coming
and parts of Djakarta were littered with
the paper of exploded fireworks. All
Djakarta seemed still to be littered with
the remnants of exploded Sukarno. It
was almost impossible to discuss any-
thing else. “First> the political settle-
ment, Mr. Horne.”
Under Sukarno, Djakarta was a huge
court, in which the courtiers conspired
against each other, gossiping about
themselves and Sukarno with an extra-
ordinary vehemence and private frank-
ness. They still gossip as if Sukarno
still controlled his court. When a much-
heralded speech by Sukarno was broad-
cast it proved cautious and hedging. It
was like listening to a disappointing
episode in a famous radio serial,
A Minister of State relaxes on a
banquette . . . “No, Mr. Horne, we
don’t want to kill him. He still wants
to kill us, but we have had enough
killing” ... At an embassy party the
guests gossip only about Sukarno . . .
When I go to see Cosmas Batu Bata,
one of the six co-chairmen of the presi-
dium of KAMI, the Student Action
body, he* sits up stiffly in his cane chair,
fresh-faced but stern, and hands me a
page torn from a notebook: “1. Rem-
nants of the Old Order must be com-
pletely exterminated. 2. Political
stability as soon as possible. 3. Stability
in the economic field.” Who are the
remnants of the Old Order? I ask.
Sukarno and his supporters. What do
you mean by exterminated? Killed? He
flicks his wrist. Yes, of course, kill him.
The Western Press has been im-
patient for Sukarno to be deposed,
quicksmart. But the wiseheads who have
been nagging the new leaders of Indo-
nesia to hurry up about it have ignored
the intricacy of the moves by which the
new leadership has been caging Su-
karno, and then carefully plucking him
■ of power, feather by feather, but with a
respect for legitimacy.
Whatever happens to the man
Sukarno, surely Sukarno is now dead.
The fun of military and economic
adventurism, the gay escapades of
power, the bright rainbows of global
importance have collapsed into a
puddle of inflation and debt. Whatever
tragedies of poverty and faction may
still be enacted in Indonesia, it may be
impossible for 20 years, for a whole
generation, to find the funds to erect
such a crazy facade again.
Who would put up the money? The
Russians summon Indonesians to Mos-
cow, insisting on prompt repayment.
The non-Communist creditors gather
in Tokyo, in Paris, in Amsterdam,
reading lectures on pragmatism, and
offering concessions by dictating policy.
The Japanese flock to Djakarta, ex-
pectant and determined, moving into
its economy to help make it work.
Although a Djakarta editor assured
me that** “our economy has been much
better in the past fortnight,” the econ-
omy may swivel around desperately for
several more years while the good-
housekeeping measures the creditors
enforce lead to popular discontent.
But a country like Indonesia can still
function even when it does not meet
the standards of economic stability of
developed societies. Where it must meet
international standards is in its inter-
national economic policy. And here
it is in the hands of its creditors.
An ebullient belief that Indonesia
has something to show the world sti *1
exists. But as long as it does not burst
into military extravaganza, what does
that matter? After Indonesia I visited
six other Asian States and in each of
them there was also a belief that each
State had something to show the
world. What one hopes is that, for a
while, Indonesia will scale its ambit-
ions down a bit, think of itself as a
South-East Asian power first and dis-
play its initiatives fruitfully in that
region.
In one sense the definition of
Indonesian purpose was what most
of the conversations I had in Djakarta
were about. What was Indonesia now
to do? Some of the discussion was
still confounded by the claptrap of
post-Sukarnoist terminology, especially*
in the more lusty fanfares in the news-
papers. ELIMINATE THE DEVIAT-
ING AND HYPOCRITICAL PRAC-
TICES OF THE OLD ORDER AND
OTHER CRIMINAL COUNTER-
REVOLUTIONARY ELEM E N TS
IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE
NEW ORDER. Sukarno’s habit of
'sloganising now lives on in the mouths
of his enemies, but it . seems to exist
mainly in print. In conversation there


and A USTRALIA
The next 20 years
is a return to cooler language and a
persistent usage of the word pragmatic.
“The era of Great men is over. The
Nkrumahs and Sukarnos are finished.”
I heard this not only in Djakarta, but
in Singapore, Saigon, and Seoul. There
is a boredom with the old nationalist or
Afro-Asian rhetoric, the mere drum-
ming-up of words. But in Djakarta the
rhetoric of modernisation and of social
justice still comes haltingly. Like the
leadership in Burma, Sukarno had
turned his back on giving even lip
service to the aspirations that improve-
ment of material conditions for ordinary
people is an essential task. He preferred
the heroic style to the pragmatic un-
finished monuments in weary paddocks
rather than filling in the potholes in the
streets and left such a verbal legacy
that some of those who now want to
be pragmatic are nevertheless not quite
sure what to say.
In the new generation, although they
were brought up on Sukarno’s battle-
field of words, there is more under-
standing. It is a delight to find how
resilient to the bombast of their lead-
ers young minds can be. It was even
a delight to find that when a Djakarta
editor brought his son with him “so
that he can see an Australian,” the son
was dressed like an Australian teen-
ager and remained coolly aloof toward
the conversation of his elders.
Boisi Liok, representative of the
“independents” on the presidium of
KAMI, talked to me in a typical
student’s bedroom, bed unmade, books
scattered around, the sign “Casino
Royale” scrawled on the door. He spent
some time in a kibbutz when he was
overseas and hopes that KAMI’S final
role will be to take the spirit of
modernisation to the villages. Every
night, he says, his group of students
meet and they discuss Modernisation.
“First, a Mentality Revolution! Then
an Organisation Revolution.” The sky
suddenly falls down on us in a black
storm and a cannonade of rainwater
adds emotion to what he is saying.
He speaks pleasantly and softly, let-
ting the rainwater provide the emotion,
sad eyes in a long triangular face com-
plemented by a student’s grin. It is
somehow heartening when he com-
plains of student apathy. All most
students want is a job, a house, a car,
he says it’s as if Indonesia were a
Settled Society. Indonesia, he says, must
become a . . . what is the word? . . .
like the American West? Pioneering? I
suggest. Yes, Indonesia must become a
pioneering society, like the American
West. Like Australia, too, I suggest.
Yes, Indonesia must become a pioneer-
ing society like Australia.
With other students it is also en-
couraging to hear a familiar conversa-
tion —"of the conflict between the
generations. There are the older RSL
types, the generation of Freedom
Fighters, reliving battles, and the
young, with new and different enthu-
siasms. The generals? There were too
many generals, was the answer, too
many generals living in the past, but
the students I met seemed to trust
Suharto. “Suharto cares for the pea-
sants.” After Sukarno? “After Sukarno
we must not sink back into the corrup-
tion.”
To be a nation of more than
100,000,000 people, however exaspera-
ted by poverty, is to see oneself in the
world in a way Australians cannot
imagine. Although military show might
rust away it seems unlikely that Indo-
nesians will lose their understandable
sense of self-importance. Here both the
Malaysians and the Filipinos may be
in error when they put up their own
schemes for regional co-operation.
When the Indonesians are ready to
talk about regional co-operation it
seems likely that they will have their
own ideas. They may not just say me
too to President Marcos, and certainly
not to Tunku Abdul Rahman.
Some of the Indonesians I spoke to
were more interested in regional co-
operation with Australia and New
Zealand than with Malaysia and the
Philippines. They even discussed defence
pacts “between the oceanic powers.”
When I told this to a Filipino Senator
in Manila (where the claim to Sabah
is still going strong) he was shocked.
“Why,” he said, “we are all one race!
We are all Malays. We show ethnic
similarity!” To the Indonesians this
ethnic argument may no longer be
conclusive. Australians and New Zea-
landers may not be Malays: but they
are skilled, adaptable, “westernised,”
and prosperous.
After the Japanese war and the col-


lapse of colonial empire, we Austra-
lians had to reorient ourselves to the
fact that our nearest neighbors were
the Indonesians. We began doing this
20 years ago and, although there were
no doubt many crudities in the way
in which we jolted into this reorienta-
tion, crudities of both love and hate,
we have got on with the job. For some
Indonesians, reorienting themselves to
the fact that their most important
neighbor is Australia, and that this
matters, is something with which they
have been concerned for merely 20
weeks, if that.
There was the continuing tradition
that we had supported them against
the Dutch (and a continuing hatred
of Sir Percy Spender’s attitude to Indo-
nesia when he was External Affairs
Minister), and an official friendship
•which because of the skill of our
official policy survived the Con-
frontation. (Our Embassy wasn’t
stoned.) But somehow, whatever the
"...the era of Great Men is over"
map said, we were not really there,
next to Indonesia, or if we were, there
was some doubt as to whether we had
any right to be there. We were an old
thing, an anomaly that history might
correct when it got around to it. When
I suggested that some Indonesian uni-
versity should later set up a School of
Australian Studies, as we have Schools
of Indonesian Studies, this seemed too
revolutionary for even the exponents
of the New Order.
With some of those I spoke to, how-
ever, including the most influential,
there seemed to be something of an
uncertain reaching out toward Australia
. . . not the outstretched hand holding
the begging bowl but a kind of reach-
ing toward the future, to a common
humanity, and to a destiny in which
the ordinary people of Indonesia might
be acquainted with those amenities in
life that are now so humdrum among
us.
It is perhaps in this spirit that we
should now begin to approach Indo-
nesia. For 25 years (although official
policy has been more subtle) many
Australians have seen South-East Asia
mainly in terms of crisis, even of im-
mediate catastrophe. The period in
which this represents a useful approach
may now be ending. We have, in fact,
already introduced many refinements,
extended many friendships, but behind
it all there has often been a sense of
insubstantiality: that present friendships
b l o wn out hy later cataclysm.
„ , , .
Perhaps they will be. The area is
still unstable. But we know how to act
things go wrong. We should now
start thinking about what we should
do if things go right. As part of the
crisis approach, we should make our
alliances and send off our exneditions;
we are now even beginning- to make
some sense of our military forces. But
apart from really revolutionising our
armed forces so that they are truly
Australian in conception (and this is
something we should be doing now)
perhaps we have taken the crisis
approach about as far as it need go.
It does not necessarily harm crisis
planning to plan also for the possibility
of friendship. To take a crude example:
when I visited a Vietnamese village in
which the Australian sth Battalion was
conducting an interrogation, although
the villagers were confined into IN
and OUT trays of barbed wire en-
closures as they went, one by one, to
sit in the schoolroom with Vietnamese
interrogators to see if they would pass
their examination, the band was play-
ing “Just a Spoonful of Sugar Makes
the Medicine Go Down,” the dentist
and doctor had set up their tents, and
a couple of diggers were mixing up an
oildrum of Instant Cherry Punch Mix.
It is possible that the great crises
for Australia are a generation or more
away, not necessarily in a Communist
context (what will “Communism” be
in 20 years?), and perhaps at present
unimaginable. It is even possible that
crisis may not exist for us if by that
time we have really learned to behave
naturally in our geographic environ-
ment, to act as if we are ourselves.
Here the present changes in Indo-
nesia may be of overwhelming import-
ance. Imagine what a difference it
would make if, whatever the internal
problems of Indonesia, our two nations,
given the differences that arise between
even the matiest of nations, remain
friendly for the next 20 years.
In this time tens of thousands of
Australians might have established con-
tacts with Indonesians and at all levels
Australian and Indonesian organisations
might be dealing with each other. One
can say that there are many ways in
which this would do the Indonesians
good, but consider also the even greater
good it would do us. It is by develop-
ments such as these, not merely by
diplomacy or by military expeditions
or by trade, that Australia is losing
its provincialism, its sense that the
really important is far away, and
developing a new sense of national
identity, in which the really important
seems to be here at home. This is
what is meant by saying that Australia
might become “Asian.”
Which would liberate the imagina-
tion of young Australians more? To
continue to serve their two-year term
in the ghettoes of Earls Court? Or to


spend a couple of years working in
Indonesia, among Indonesians?
South-East Asia is not, of course, a
kind of sanatorium to which Austra-
lians go for a cure. With the Indo-
nesians, as with other nations in South-
East Asia, we must find out what ways
they want us to help them, and then,
perhaps, be choosy about which of
them we pick. With so many things
to do, it is sensible to choose those
which might be the most use, and
which can actually be achieved.
But we must also look for the ways
in which Indonesians can help us.
In economic matters these would be
hard to find: in strategic matters, Indo-
nesia is important. In matters of the
spirit, of attitudes to life, the Indo-
nesians, like other peoples in South-
East Asia, can cross-fertilise our
world-views and our culture so that
perhaps finally, in our part of the
world, we can between us give that
novelty and extension to human con-
sciousness that it would now seem that
Europe is not likely to provide.
One hesitates to write so optimistic-
ally . . . the unity provided by anti-
Sukarnoism might snap and after his
final removal Indonesia might fall to
pieces ... or unity might survive at
the cost of the pragmatism about which
people boasted to me in Djakarta . . .
or the pragmatism might again be-
come the cunning of everyone in for
his cut, salting away what he can when
he can . . . One remembers that the
massacres after the failed coup added
to the horrors of the 20th century, a
century rich in horror, and there is
no final guarantee that such mon-
strosities might not recur . . . and
also that the poverty of the peasants
in parts of Java has become alarmingly
self-generating, apparently irrevocable
In the suburbs where the generals
live you see a peaceful, prosperous
upper-class suburban villa, well
designed, nice garden, children’s toys
at the door . . . everything normal
except for the army tank on the lawn,
its gun swinging slowly like an ele-
phant’s trunk, and for the sub-machine-
guns poking out of the garage instead
of the handle of the motor mower. It
was from pleasant houses like these
that men were pulled across the neatly
trimmed lawns, killed, and then
mutilated ...
It is easy enough to be sceptical
about the future of Indonesia, especi-
ally when it is or perhaps more
exactly Djakarta is still passing
through a political revolution. When I
sat with some students who were plan-
ning a demonstration, one of them was
introduced as “a fine poet and fighter,”
another as “painter and revolutionary,”
another as “perhaps the best of our
younger poets and very brave.” There
they were, so young, so good-humored,
puffing at scented cigarettes a
“Hang Sukarno” demonstration in the
morning, a poem written in the after-
noon, a tutorial on modernisation of
agricultural techniques at night.
Perhaps it is this combination of
good humor, liveliness, and serious pur-
pose that both provides some of the
hope for Indonesia and something of a
SUKARNO... with his cap off
reminder to us. When I visited one of
the newspaper offices it was certainly a
reminder to me that a determined spirit
sustains hope. By almost anybody’s
standards the office was alarmingly
inadequate: reporters’ bikes were parked
behind their desks, next to the clatter
of the composing room; circulation had
been cut from 45,000 to 30,000 because
newsprint was short; the paper could
run to only four pages. But like other
post-Subandrio papers, refreshed like
desert flowers after rain, there is a
springing into life: the paper represents
ldea, it is built around a concept of
what things should become. When we
were a struggling colony we had papers
like that, too.
Mochtar Lubis is a startlingly con-
fident embodiment of such hope. It was
night when I visited him. Unlike many
other genuinely brave men he looks a
hero—six feet high, handsome, an
entrancing smile. The flash of fireworks
exploding in his garden lit up a strong
and generous face. He is a man who
once defended the paper he was editing
with his fists and was later a prisoner
of Sukarno’s for nine years. His deter-
mination to say what he thinks, to be
his own man, may have got him into
trouble in any society. But he is still
bouncing with schemes. A writer,
painter, sculptor, an amateur flyer, radio
engineer, he bursts with life.
A couple of days later, as we bounced
along the potholes to have lunch at a
Chinese place Lubis wanted to try
out, he told me about his magazine . . .
about the newspaper he is starting . . .
about radio stations ... As a result
of a chance remark of mine he began
thinking about starting an advertising
agency. It occurred to me that this was
something an Australian could under-
stand. Improvise. Give-it-a-go. It is not
all that long since we started advertising
agencies with equal insouciance.
On my last afternoon in Djakarta I
visited the house of a servant of some
Australian friends. His little cottage
was part of a huge “village” submerged
behind the streets of rich people’s
houses, but sprawling over acres, a huge
village inside a suburb, entered by
criss-crosses of tiny lanes. In some ways
the cottage was the humble home of a
faithful servant in an English village,
imitating with poignant modesty the
furniture of the Master; in other ways
it pulled at my own memories of being
a country boy in Australia, of poor
people keeping up appearances.
It was desperately clean. On the wall
of the tiny front parlor there were two
oil paintings and a framed collection of
family snapshots: on the mantelshelf
there was a snap of the favorite son,
the eldest, now in Singapore, playing
with a combo. It was the afternoon of
a feast day and there was something of
the enervated atmosphere of an Aus-
tralian suburban Christmas afternoon, a
lull between excitements.
The flowers were in small silver vases.
On the little wooden table was a freshly
ironed tablecloth. Two little fish swam
in a jam jar on the chest-of-drawers.
Dominating the room was an old
dresser, filled with treasures —unmatch-
ing plates, colored glasses, bits and
pieces. We sipped orangeade and ate
slices of sponge cake, while the master
of the house sat on one side of his
chair clasping his hands, laughing ner-
vously yet sensitively. His son had
promised to come home from Singapore
... he hadn’t arrived . . . what had
happened to him?
It is one of the specialties of our
age to categorise the differences between
human beings. Perhaps it would also be
fruitful for us to examine our simi-
larities.

The White-Collar Unions
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
LAST year J. S. Baker, an official
of the Postal Clerks and Teleg-
raphists’ Union and publicity offi-
cer for the Australian Council of
Salaried and Professional Associations,
. issued a report analysing the white-
collar scene in Marxist terms:'
“. . . Because of the repressive feudal
elements that have been grafted into Aus-
tralia’s system of industrial regulation,
so wrongly called Arbitration, white-
collar workers may have to campaign
in a very broad way.”
Baker indicated the direction of this
“broad way” when he claimed that
white-collar organisations have a
greater power than manual workers for
causing inconvenience because their
members are in control of key service
industries: transport, hospitals, and pub-
lic facilities.
Labor historian Dr. lan Turner
believes that white-collar unions must
inevitably grow more political in charac-
ter. He suggests that the advance of
automation will create a mounting mili-
tancy in white-collar organisations and
that the late 1960 s and early 1970 s
will be for the office worker what the
1890 s was for the manual worker.
Mr. Ray O’Dea, a leading industrial
advocate and research scholar, claims
that there are now more white-collar
than blue-collar workers in Australia.
In factories, for example, the number
of non-manual workers rose by over 50
percent between 1949 and 1959, whilst
the number of manual workers rose by
only a little more than 20 percent.
“White collar” is a term generally
applied to jobs which are primarily non-
manual in character. In this area the
most common occupation has been
clerical, but the fastest-growing group
is now the professional, technological,
and managerial, who in a generation
will amount to perhaps 25 percent, by
which time these occupations will rate v
higher in the statistics than the clerical.
Nearly 60 percent of the blue-collar
workers are unionised, but of the
1,500,000 white-collar workers only
about 30 percent are organised in their
unions or professional associations. The
reasons for the relatively low percentage
of union membership may be guessed:
the higher status of non-manual jobs,
their higher pay and better working
conditions, the closer relations between
employer and employee, and the atmos-
phere fostered in some firms that it is
bad form for “staff men to give their
loyalties to a union.”
There are strong economic and social
forces working against white-collar
employees and in favor of the white-
collar unions. The first is the fact that
many office workers have lost the
superior economic position they for-
merly held. In terms of wage rates,
overtime, annual leave, working hours,
long-service leave, and superannuation
the blue collars have made relatively
larger gains in the post-war period.
Meanwhile, the security of clerical
workers is challenged by automation,
electronic data processing, and com-
puters. For clerical workers with un-
impressive educational qualifications
working in banks, insurance offices, and
the offices of large manufacturing and
retail companies the future is as bleak
as the grey faces of electronic machines.
For professional and technological
employees there is the feeling that with
money and organisation they can win
handsome gains through arbitration.
The Professional Engineers’ case, which
ended in 1961, was perhaps the greatest
victory ever won by an Australian
white-collar group. The legal battle
lasted a number of years and cost the
Australian Professional Engineers’ Asso-
ciation more than $160,000, but the
salary gains won were so high that the
Commonwealth Government almost
passed special legislation to attempt to
block the application of the award to
many public servants.
For all of these reasons the white-
collar unions, disguised by a bewilder-
ing array of names and initials, expect
the next decade to be one of growth
and conflict. In explaining the signifi-
cance of the various white-collar
organisations it may be best to begin
with the so-called “umbrella” institu-
tions. The four chief ones are usually
introduced by their initials, ASCPA,
HCCPSO, APSF, and CPA.
The Australian Council of Salaried
and Professional Associations (ASCPA)
has 39 affiliated organisations, of which
the largest are the Federated Clerks
(also affiliated with the ACTU), the
Australian Bank Officials, the Australian
Teachers, the Australian Insurance
Staffs, the AESDA (Architects, En-
gineers, Surveyors, and Draughtsmen
of Australia), and the Municipal
Officers.
ACSPA has aspirations to be the
ACTU of the non-Public Service white-
collar workers. The secretary of ACSPA,
R. D. (“Barney”) Williams, who is
also secretary of the Bank Officials, is
working hard to have the organisation
publicised and promoted in the unions,
in the ALP, and before the Arbitration
Commission and Government.
Williams has constantly promoted a
concept of three peak union bodies: his
own, the ACTU, and the High Council
of Commonwealth Public Service
Organisations (HCCPSO). The latter
“umbrella” body was set up in the early
19205, more than forty years before
ACSPA, and affiliation is restricted to
unions whose members are Common-
wealth employees, but there are more
Commonwealth employees outside than
inside HCCPSO. It has no full-time
officials.
The third “umbrella” organisation,
the Australian Public Service Federa-
tion (APSF), is composed of the State
Public Service organisations, and its
affiliates are declining in membership
and importance, compared to Federal
unions. It is trying to gain recognition
before the Federal Ai'bitrat'ion Commis-
sion and has dropped hints that it might
one day join the ACTU. APSF lost
prestige in the white-collar field when
it sided with the State and Federal
Governments after the Professional
Engineers’ judgment of 1961.
The Council of Professional Associa-
tions (CPA) has eight affiliated organi-
sations, including about 20,000 mem-
bers from the APEA, the AESDA, and
the Professional Officers of the Com-
monwealth Public Service. It claims to
be entirely non-political.
Three white-collar groups may be
roughly distinguished as operating in
the field of politics and strategies. The
pacemaking one is led from the left and
is anxious to build the power of
ACSPA beyond that of a consultative
and co-ordinating body. Now that the
ACTU seems likely to be beyond the
control of the Communists and their
allies for many years, the capturing of
ACSPA and the extension of its power
and prestige are major Leftist targets.
Communist Party theoreticians be-
lieve that automation and a relative
decline .in salaries and conditions
vis-a-vis manual workers will create
fertile conditions for militancy. Prob-
ably they will continue to promote the
idea of three peak councils of employees
—ACPSA, the ACTU, and the
HCCPSO—and attempt equality with
the ACTU.

Leftists is that the secretary of ACSPA,
“Barney” Williams, is a Whitlam-line
ALP supporter and an opponent of the
Victorian Central Executive of the ALP
and its policies. So far there has been
little conflict between the Lewis-Baker
faction and Williams, but if there is a
major clash between Whitlam and the
extreme Left of the ALP, ACSPA will
suffer a serious political fracture.
But whilst the political tensions are
considerable the industrial problems
which white-collar unions face are a
source of unity. Chief among them is
the insecurity created by automation.
Sometimes called the “white-collar
proletariat” (in one issue of the Insur-
ances Staffs’ journal the term “white-
collar. serfs” was used), the clerks of
banking, insurance, large manufacturing
plants, Government departments, such
as Taxation and Supply, and large re-
tail stores face a difficult future. It has
been estimated that every electronic
computer puts 35 people out of work
and changes the kind of work done by
another 105.
Individual unions are attempting to
negotiate for severance pay, for transfer
agreements, and for retraining programs
with firms about to introduce new elec-
tronic processes. Some research has
been conducted by the ACTU and the
ACSPA into the general effects of auto-
mation, but mainly what they have dis-
covered is that no union organisation
can handle the problem by itself. A
co-ordinated and flexible administrative
apparatus involving Federal and State
Governments, industries, and local
offices and plants is necessary to handle
the multiplying cases of redundancy and
the necessity for retraining sub-
professional workers.
The growing pressures on clerical
workers to organise for their own pro-
tection may be matched by the need
for white-collar workers of higher
qualifications and skills to win, by Arbi-
tration and collective bargaining,
salaries something near those earned by
professional men in private practice.
More cases like the Engineers’ case are
likely to be found soon, but they cannot
be fought without money and the dis-
cipline of organisation. Such organ-
sation will, in turn, have signficant poli-
tical consequences for those able to ex-
ploit it.
It is hard to imagine them as union-
conscious, but, with the threat of elec-
tronic data processing on one side and
Blondie on the other, the Dagwood
Bumsteads of the world must unite if
they are to survive the next ten years.


OVERSEAS
Trading with our neighbors
NO matter what happens to Britain
and the Common Market, Aus-
tralia could go broke unless its
trade with its neighbors continues to
rise by huge amounts. There is a good
chance of building up this trade by the
leaps and bounds we need to keep up
a reasonable level of economic growth
in Australia. For that growth we need
money to be able to buy capital equip-
ment, and it is far more important to
get it from exports than from attract-
ing capital into the country.
Australia’s continued success in Asia
depends heavily on something we can-
not control Japan’s ability to con-
tinue expanding at a rapid pace so that
it continues to need imports of Aus-
tralian raw materials.
With the European and U.S. markets
at least in doubt, it looks like Asia or
else. Prospects of doing well with our
neighbors vary widely. Our “big
three” nearby trading partners —Japan,
China, and New Zealand—demonstrate
the widely divergent prospects, with the
Japanese being on an economic up-
swing, the Chinese concern about their
internal political problems adding a
touch of uncertainty to a basic trade
level that seems secure enough, and
with the New Zealanders in the sort
of depressed condition unlike a modern
Western economy.
To a large extent, geography is bunk
in international trade; prices and
freight rates matter most, and these
are not necessarily related to distance.
Fortunately, the items that Japan is
now buying so heavily from Australia
are largely those in which freight rates
do vary with distance and we are
closer than many rivals.
A lot has happened in the past ten
years; Australia’s exports to neighboring
countries in Asia and to New Zealand
last year were almost one-third of our
total exports about three times the
proportion of a decade ago. Although
this has been mainly because of Japan’s
increased buying of Australian raw
materials, there have been some strik-
ing rises in sales of manufactured
goods, too.
But while exports have jumped, Aus-
tralia’s neighbors have only managed
to lift their share of Australia’s imports
from 11 percent to about 18 percent,
and there is mounting pressure from
.two of them, Japan and New Zealand,
for Australia to do a lot better than
this.
JAPAN "...thoroughly bad deal"
At present we sell Japan about two-
thirds as much again as we buy from
there; the Japanese consider this a
thoroughly bad deal. Their trade
negotiators are well aware of Aus-
tralia’s dependence on exports to Japan.
Lately the situation has been getting
worse. In the latest five months, the
proportion of Australia’s imports that
came from Japan actually fell below the
ten percent mark to which it had risen
in 1965-66.
So while Australia’s recent exports to
Japan had risen 27 percent, the trade
the other way dropped by 11 per-
cent; and Japanese officials are re-
ported to be “most concerned” about
the damage done to their trade to Aus-
tralia by Australian tariffs and support-
prices. It is hard to take the Japanese
complaints too seriously when Japan
runs a very comfortable trade balance
with the world at large that is listed for
even further improvement under the
latest economic plan. In any event,
Japan buys from Australia because we
have what she wants at the right price;
if we bought nothing from Japan, she
would still be a customer. Anyway, we
are now Japan’s second-biggest market.
But there is no denying the impor-
tance of Japan to Australia, as trade
between the two countries has increased
remarkably since the first Australia-
Japan Trade Agreement was signed al-
most 10 years ago. This year Japan
will become indisputably Australia’s
biggest customer; last year the Japanese
bought more than 17 percent of Aus-
tralia’s total exports, or just a fraction
less than Britain. Iron ore, coal, man-
ganese, and the other raw materials
that Japan needs as fuel for her in-
dustrial advance will lift this propor-
tion considerably in the coming years
no matter what happens to our falter-
ing wool export figures. It won’t be long
before Australia depends on Japan for
something like one quarter of her ex-
ports.
The trade has not only increased;
it has substantially changed in charac-
ter. From the old system of selling wool
and wheat and buying cotton textiles
in return, Australia’s trade with Japan
is getting much more “horizontal” (by
exchanging more finished and semi-
finished products) as is normal between
developed countries and despite the
recent huge raw material export de-
velopments. In proportion, wool’s share
of Australia’s Japanese exports had
fallen from about 80 percent a little
more than 10 years ago to little more
than half last year. And Japanese ex-
ports of cotton textiles to Australia now
make up less than a quarter of Japan’s
sales to Australia compared with
almost three-quarters 10 years ago.
Japan’s main exports to Australia are
heavier manufactured goods like motor
vehicles and machinery, whose propor-
tion of Japan’s total sales here has
risen from less than a third three years
ago to more than a half last year. Aus-
tralia buys more steel from Japan
than from any other country.
There is no doubt about the import-
ance of Japan for our primary products.
Japan is now our second biggest market
for sugar, our second best customer for
cheese and of casein, and our meat sales
there jumped by more than half last
year. And the chances are for increas-
ing Japanese buying of Australian food.
But it is in the huge mineral develop-
ments that Australia’s growing export
trade with Japan depends most heavily.
A year ago, we had never exported any
iron ore to Japan; in three years, Aus-
tralia will be supplying about a quarter
of Japan’s total iron ore imports under
existing contracts (and more are likely
to follow), and exports of bauxite and
manganese ore to Japan are also mount-
ing.
Australia has replaced the U.S. as
'Japan’s biggest coal supplier, with
seven million tons last year and more
to come, and the Japanese estimate
Australia will provide more than half
their import demand of coal in 1966-67,
and almost two-thirds by 1970.
Japanese unhappiness about our level
of imports has not prevented them
from investing increasing amounts of
cash in Australian operations even
though Japanese exchange control is
so tough that most investments have
to be paid for by funds earned from
export sales to Australia. This fortun-
ately coincides with Australian efforts
to find a source of capital to replace
the flow from the U.S. and the U.K.
which has been so disrupted by official
measures. Japanese investment in Aus-
tralian industry has been almost exclu-
sively in areas that relate directly to
Japan’s imports or exports.
But striking enough as the changes
in Australia’s trading relations with
Japan have been, and will continue to
be, Australian businessmen and officials
do not yet seem to have fully realised
their significance; the official Common-
wealth statistics of trade with major
groups of countries lists Britain sepa-
rately, and has a section on North
America, but our biggest customer,
Japan, still stays among the “all
others.”


CHINA "...not so temporary”
First of a series. This wee!.
Michael Baume discusses “The
Big Three ” Japan , China,
New Zealand. Next week Peter
Samuel reports on the
economy of Indonesia after
his recent visit. Other surveys
will follow.
WHEAT. Apart from that, Austra-
lia’s trading relations with main-
land China barely exist. Wheat
usually makes up about 80 percent or so
of Australia’s exports to China, and we
usually sell the Chinese about six times
what we buy from them. The only
other items of any consequence we sell
to China, apart from wheat, are wool
and wool tops, a bit of steel, and some
manufactured metal goods. The only
things of any consequence we buy from
China are textiles (particularly cotton
and silk grey goods) and clothing.
There seems to be little scope for
any dramatic rise in Chinese exports
to Australia, as the products are gener-
ally not very up to date in styling and
there are few things we need available
for export although in some lines
like shoes the Chinese have done very
well. And at present, delivery times are
most unreliable. But the Chinese wheat-
buying campaigns that have not only
solved Australia’s wheat-surplus prob-
lems but even brought about a shortage
after last year’s drought (we had to
reduce our sales to China), are largely
misunderstood in Australia. These are
not lucky and unusual contracts but
part of a lasting economic strategy
(which, “by the way, now seems far
more related to questions of economics
than to political strategy).
The wheat trade is not as temporary
as it may look; it has not depended
simply on the natural disasters (floods
or drought) that seem to afflict some
part of China almost continually. Even
though these may have been a stimulus
to early purchases and last year the
drought in the northern provinces
helped stimulate demand the basic
Chinese economic strategy is aimed at
the country continuing to be a large
wheat importer. To get a part of this
trade Australia will have to offer deals
better than those the Canadians arrange
(fortunately the Americans are out of
the running), and the Canadians have
far friendlier relations on other levels
with Peking than Australia.
China’s importing strategy with wheat
is that even if and when the Chinese
agricultural sector becomes efficient
enough to be able to make the country
self-sufficient (a most unlikely prospect
in the first place) the proper role for
China to then pursue would be to
export large amounts of her rice pro-
duction, for which she would get reason-
able export prices, as there is no world
surplus of rice and for which there
is no likelihood of one developing that
could force rice prices down to absurd
levels in international trade. This means
that China would then import wheat to
provide food even if she theoretically
were growing enough food to supply her
population. The economic reasoning be-
hind this is that world wheat prices are
artificially low. and are maintained there
by the governments of wheat-producing
countries. It is simply a better economic
proposition for China to sell expensive
rice and buy cheap wheat. This means
trying to convince rice-eating Chinese
that they should switch to eating more
wheat products - a task made easier
by the political system there than it
would be in other economies. There
are other factors, too. The transport
problems involved in moving large
amounts of food from growing areas
into the big population areas like Shang-
hai for local consumption are so great
that it is often easier and cheaper to
import it from Australia or Canada.
China’s total grain imports, shared
mainly between Canada and Australia,
total about 5 to 6 million tons yearly
(against local production of about 200
million tons) to help feed a population
between 700 and 750 million people.
There has been a slowing down in
the rate of expansion of Chinese exports
and imports with the rest of the world
in the past year or so, but the figures
are healthy and still point upwards.
The slowdown has been blamed by some
observers on the need for so many
workers in the export industries to
devote so much time to the cultural
revolution and “reading the works. of
Mao.” However, foodstuffs consumption
per head has increased, for instance,
even though there is still not really
enough food to go around.
The third five-year plan began in
January, 1966, but so far it has been
very difficult to get any solid informa-
tion about its progress. The Far Eastern
Economic Review reports that the
Chinese have confined themselves to
talking about “a very healthy situation”
on the economic front, with new
in production and construction, the
Chinese Press has .not had much to
say about economics recently. Some
observers say that the existence of a
fully comprehensive five-year plan is
rather doubtful, and that most likely a
framework with a set of priorities has
been worked out. And the political tur-
moil of the last few months may ..have
disrupted that, anyway.
Other commentators believe that
agriculture now accounts for about two-
fifths of China’s total output and about
half of the State budget. About 80 per-
cent of the population are said to live
in the countryside and 70 percent of
the labor force is in agriculture.
Agriculture is the basis of the economy
and provided SU.S.BOO million of
China’s exports last year, having
doubled in three years. And with the
rapid increase in China’s fertiliser
industry, the rural sector is expected to
make increasing contributions to indus-
trial development both internally and
by providing foreign exchange.
The Cultural Revolution is reported
to have had some effect on the Chinese
economy, but it could have been over-
stated. And in any event, the “excesses”
of the movement are generally said to
have been corrected in those sectors of
Chinese economy which run such things
as export industries. But while China’s
political problems with the Moscow
Communists have affected trade with
the Eastern bloc (last September the
Chinese closed their exhibit at the Leip-
zig Fair because of East German “Mos-
cow line” criticism of the cultural
revolution), it has had no real impact
with Australia, except that some Aus-
tralian businessmen were unable to
visit China on a buying trip recently.
Europe and Japan are the major
sources of China’s industrial goods now
that the Soviet bloc is out of favor.
Britain has been the biggest supplier,
closely followed by West Germany, then
France and Italy, all of which have
been increasing their sales sharply at
least until the disruption of recent
months. Chinese exports to these coun-
tries are mainly agricultural and min-
eral raw materials.

NEW ZEALAND "...difficulties"
THERE has been an awful lot of
talk about doing more trade with
New Zealand; there is a 14-
month-old Trade Agreement; last week
the two Governments agreed to extend
it in what could be a significant way
for manufactured goods and a N.Z.
Trade Mission is now tripping around
Australia trying to sell its wares. But
there are simple difficulties standing
in the way of this trade ever doing
well. The New Zealanders have little
to sell that we want (although we
probably do need some things like
dairy produce that we don’t realise we
need) and they have no money to
increase their buying of Australian
goods. There is every indication that
Australia-New Zealand trade will fall
following the Holyoake Government’s
recent severe restraints on the rate of
growth of the N.Z. economy.
It will take more than controls to get
N.Z. out of its mess. N.Z. depends
for its export income on primary pro-
ducts whose major market, Britain, is
not only in a recession, but may also
soon enter the Common Market; the
price of its wool (mainly for carpet-
making) has been knocked on world
markets by excellent new synthetics;
and rival countries have been selling
lamb cheaper than N.Z. can. And on
top of that, N.Z. is being hit by higher
shipping freights to its three major
markets Britain, Australia, and
Japan.
But the reason for the present crisis
is not simply that the prices of N.Z.’s
exports have fallen by more than the
Government had gambled when it let
the economy run on too fast for so
long or even that the drop in capital
inflow from the U.K. under the Wilson
Government’s restrictions presented an
unexpected burden on the balance of
payments. The N.Z. economy had been
on the wrong track for years. Not only
have New Zealanders been spending
more than their external earnings could
stand or their internal economy could
satisfactorily supply, but the Govern-
ment has also been over-ambitious about
the level of spending it could main-
tain without damaging the economy.
There are plenty of economists in New
Zealand who want to see a devaluation
of its £. And if N.Z. does devalue, a
good time to do it may be July 10,
when the country goes decimal. This
could reduce Australia’s export income
from N.Z., and it would give N.Z. ex-
ports a greater chance in Australian
markets because they could become
cheaper.
The N.Z. economy may take quite a
while to recover its momentum; the .
restraints were imposed because New
Zealand was living far beyond her
means. But the New Zealanders say
that one reason their “means” are so
small is that Australia does not buy
enough from them.
The most important thing about N.Z.
in Australia’s trade is not how much it
sells but what it sells. N.Z. is the
biggest single export outlet for Austra-
lian secondary industry, taking about
one-third of its exports, which is far
more significant than the fact that only
about six percent of Australia’s total
exports go there. Despite the continued
import restrictions, these manufactured
exports (which make up about three-
quarters of our N.Z. trade) have been
increasing steadily; in the past four
years they have gone up by almost one-
third. Twenty million dollars’ worth of
motor cars, $25 million of iron and
steel, and $7 million of copper products
made up the largest items in New
Zealand’s $125 million purchases of
Australian manufactured goods last
year.
Australia’s imports from N.Z. have
been going up at the same rate, but
the amounts involved are so much
smaller. But if Australia buys only a
little from New Zealand, it is a very
important little, as it makes up about
two-thirds of New Zealand’s exports of
manufactured products (although less
than 3 percent of its total exports,
which are mainly agricultural pro-
ducts); the bulk of this was in pulp*
paper, and paper board.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Facing the Music
By PAUL FROLICH
THE Sydney Symphony Orchestra
subscription series for 1967 begins
this week. A week or two ago the
ABC had a satisfactory number of
people uncomfortably queued up out-
side its offices for 24 hours or more
waiting for possible cancellations. This
sometimes seems to be taken as evidence
within the ABC of the excellence of its
concert management.
However, there are some indications
that the seemingly immutable patterns
of the past couple of decades are chang-
ing. Now might be as good a time as
any to look again at some aspects of
the ABC’s role in Australian music-
making.
With unflagging pride in size as an
achievement, spokesmen for the ABC
often claim that it is the “world's
largest concert management.” This may
be true. What is true is that the ABC
occupies a near-monopolistic position in
this field in Australia.
In other centres there are usually
some half dozen competing manage-
ments. In London or Munich there
might be simultaneous concerts by two
or three performers of world status,
given comparable support by patrons,
critics, and the Press, publicised from
comparable budgets.
This isn’t likely to happen in Aus-
tralia. Musica Viva in chamber music
manages a number of concerts almost
as monopolistically, but not in competi-
tion with the ABC. There are a few
smaller managements who present
serious musicians, but fhey are some-
times artists who have not landed an
ABC contract or who will not accept
ABC terms.
' Sir Charles Moses, when he was head
of the ABC, often said that the Com-
mission had not entered the concert
field for any reason other than that it
had to do so. This is historically true,
but this does not mean its activities
cannot be criticised or that their mono-
lithic character need be perpetuated.
Younger music-lovers, brought to an
awareness of music through school
broadcasts, school concerts, and youth
concerts, may accept the situation with-
out, I fear, suspecting that any other
way of music is possible.
As for artists, most c*f them hope for
ABC engagements and are chary of
setting up in apparent opposition to the
colossus, so jeopardising prospects of
later, more lucrative, contracts. Control
of artists’ itineraries is of less obvious
interest to the public, but is frequently
the subject of private complaints from
artists who find they are allowed insuffi-
cient time to rehearse, practise, and
relax between arduous engagements in
widely scattered centres.
Control of repertoire is a frequent
point for unfavorable comment by
critics and visiting artists alike.
Although Mr. John Hopkins, as Direc-
tor of Music, has brought some fresh
air into programming, the general struc-
ture of symphony concerts and recitals
remains almost unchanged. The success
of the more adventurous Promenade
Concerts proves that concert-goers are
not all conservative, but overseas artists
may still find that half the repertoire
submitted by them has been rejected
and that they are billed to perform
works which either bore or irritate them.
A very serious result of the ABC’s
absolute control is its effect on artists’
free time. Local instrumentalists of any
competence are usually members of one
of the ABC orchestras; as such they
work long hours, undertake country
tours and have little leisure for private
music-making, for study or for teaching
and coaching. The final effect of this
has become obvious in the growing
shortage of well-trained young players
to fill vacancies in these same orchestras.
Overseas artists, whose presence could
be of greatest value to our musical life,
rarely find an opportunity for other
than platform appearances. A great
violinist, for example, whose fame might
be based on the interpretation of
sonatas, ought to give a half dozen
sonata recitals and to spend the rest of
his time in Australia holding master
classes and playing chamber music
with our leading players. Instead, such
an artist is made to play concerti with
four different orchestras on at least six
occasions, give five or more recitals,
which include a leavening of hackneyed
virtuoso pieces and spend much of his
remaining time being interviewed, tele-
vised, and flown around the capital
cities with an odd trip to a country
centre.
At the end of his tour, and in a state
of exhaustion, such an artist has met
ABC officials, conductors, and a few
favored socialites; he knows nothing of
Australia, less of our musicians, hasn't
taught anyone anything, and is, all too
often, glad to be gone.
I appreciate the ABC’s belief that it
is its function to give concerts, not to
run our musical life. However, by the
very rigidity of its policy it does, in
fact, run our musical life and gives
little scope to anyone wishing to depart
from the beaten path. There are today
some great artists—Enrico Mainardi is
one who comes to mind—who avoid
formal concert engagements as much as
possible and who are happiest when
communicating their experience to
younger musicians and music-lovers
through classes, demonstration lectures,
and the like. It may fairly be argued
that activities of this kind are the proper
function of universities and conserva-
toria, but the ABC is probably the only
body which could afford to do this sort
of thing regularly.
During my musical pilgrimage last
year I became sharply aware of
apparent anomalies in the ABC’s
method of selecting overseas artists and
I heard much criticism, some of it bitter,


of the ABC. As a successful manage-
ment, the Commission’s policy-makers
have a dual problem: to engage the best
artists and to present seasons of popular
appeal. If an artist has once toured
Australia, has been proved amenable
and to have audience-appeal, the
temptation to re-engage him or her must
be hard to resist.
Each new artist needs a publicity
build-up, and may, after all that, prove
difficult to get on with or unpopular
with subscribers. Hence good artists—
as Brendel, Arrau, Menuhin—have little
difficulty in getting their agents to sell
the ABC yet another tour. Unfortu-
nately, the same often goes for lesser
artists who also receive repeat contracts
to the exclusion of greater ones, still
unknown to Australian listeners.
In Europe I heard brilliant per-
formances from artists such as pianists
Joerg Demus and Eric Heidsieck, con-
ductor Peter Maag, contralto Anna
Reynolds, all unknown to our audiences
and, apparently, unsuccessful in obtain-
ing contracts to tour here. In other
cases, early caution led the ABC to wait
for an artist’s fame to mount. Such as
Regine Crespin, Vladimir Ashkenazy,
and David Zinman, whom they would
probably like to engage now, have
moved into a bracket of very high fees
and now have calendars so full that it
is almost impossible to entice them to
Australia.
Another rather curious aspect of ABC
artist-management is the treatment
given to artists who come here under
their own steam. When Lili Kraus
toured independently in 1959 she was
given one engagement, to play in the
picture theatre in the Sydney suburb of
Lindfield. Helen McKinnon, a fine Aus-
tralian singer, whose lieder recitals are
acclaimed throughout Europe, was
heard in a single recital from Brisbane
during a visit home a few years ago.
Equally irritating is the ABC belief
that fulsome publicity will so transform
a mediocre performer that he will not
only become acceptable to a steadily
more critical public, but that he will,
in fact, turn into a better artist. This
attitude was much more blatant in the
early years of concert-giving when the
almost unknown Georg Schneevoigt
was billed as a “celebrity,” but it still
happens as it did recently in the case
of conductor Gunnar Staern, who was
no more than competent. Europe today
is full of exciting younger conductors,
as is America, many of whom could
make valuable contributions to our
musical life and whose worth is known
from recordings; surely we would prefer
them to publicity-created “celebrities.”
ABC conservatism shows itself in
various ways, one of the most obvious
being manner of presentation. One of
our recent visitors, French flautist Jean-
Pierre Rampal, is a leading exponent
of baroque music, particularly chamber
music. His performances of flute con-
certi were, of course, splendid and very
welcome; less welcome were his con-
ventional recitals, accompanied by a
frequently inappropriate piano, when,
ideally, he should have played in
ensemble with some of our own leading
string and wind players, who, in turn,
might have benefited greatly from such
an association. .
There are evidences of a more en-
lightened policy. There has been con-
siderable encouragement given to our
own composers and we have been able
to hear some truly avant-garde music
from other countries. But the isolation
suffered by our creative artists is little
relieved by the ABC. Our composers
still need scholarships or grants to take
them overseas for learning, when visitors
to our shores could be influencing our
life more strongly. Sir William Walton’s
visit was welcome, but Walton’s is no
longer the music of today. Why cannot
we, as audiences elsewhere, be exposed
directly to the impact of musicians such
as Boulez, Stockhausen, Messiaen, Bern-
stein, Hentze?
As far as I know, the ABC has done
an excellent job of musical education in
Australia and the field they’ve had to
cultivate has been so immense that the
lack of enthusiasm for some forms of
music—such as opera—should not lead
one to condemn all their other work.
Policy on this or any other matter is
bound to please some and displease
others; that does not, of itself, make
the policy discussed either good or bad.
The thing that might prove bad, in
the long run, is any preoccupation with
a particular form of music-making, any
conscious limitation of the range of
music and music-makers offered up to
us, the listeners.
ART
Shouting Too Loud
Robert Williams. Watters Gallery,
Sydney.
Larger Works Suitable for Public
Spaces. Gallery A, Sydney.
ARTISTS are an intransigent lot;
though the air is still reverberat-
ing with the notions of Patrick
Heron, now safely back on his farm in
Cornwall’s Zennor, that the problems
of modern art are concerned with the
non-figurative disposition of flat colors
over the picture plane, asymmetry, and
a recomplication of a surface growing
too simple and bland in American
painting, artists simply don’t see them-
selves as a band of scientists solving
problems set by Matisse or, more flat-
teringly, as a troop of Galahads seeking
a brightly colored and rather flat Holy
Grail.
Indeed, Mr. Heron’s theory and
practice give little recognition to the
idiosyncratic artist who does not see
himself as part of a problem-solving
tradition, and though his lectures in
Perth and Sydney must rid us of pre-
judices about English caution, effete-
ness, and evasive good taste (which he
would translate into prudence, subtlety,
and discrimination), he disregards art
as “The Man-Made Object,” which is
also the title of a collection of essays,
dealing with objects from paleolithic
flint axes to fountain pens and Burn’s
paintings of holed sacking, edited by
Gyorgy Kepes and just to hand.
Of course, Mr. Heron is not the
single-minded zealot he might appear:
he struggles manfully to see color as
such in Ben Nicholson, and in early
1966 wrote the introduction to a cata-
logue for an exhibition of Miss Eliza-
beth Allen’s patchwork pictures in
fabrics, which resemble Persian minia-
tures and Matisse interiors. Born in
1883, she was not. “discovered” until
1965 in a tiny house in Suffolk.
So there is hope for Robert Williams,
who is on a road where the signs are
not flat and luminously colored: having
taken a fleeting glimpse of Francis
Bacon and surrealistic uses of collage,
he juxtaposes glossy cut-outs of plush
automobile interiors, glowing with
promises of pneumatic bliss, with
hairy monkeys, mice, and foxes to
evoke the idea that the car is the
Golden Calf and its worshippers mal-
formed sub-humans and downright
apes. The trouble is that Williams is
too young to be a Moses and the
Promised Land is far off. Still, he is-
capable of producing nasty unease
with a mouse atop a crushed car bleed-
ing oil or with a torn drawing of a
child’s face beneath a car’s interior
of glowing baby blue, fn others the
wreckage of cars or machinery, in
bitter fierce colors, is roamed by
crouching monkeys or stalked by a fox,,
but the presentation is too relentless
and too obscure; why should the
breasty males in Mr. Australia look so
hermaphroditic or a strong-man in
another work be given an hydroce-
phalic, collage head?
One work, Bend It, that looks at
Cezanne and Bacon, suggests another
style by which he might render his
macabre intensity more telling; at
present he shouts a little too loudly
for one to hear the message.
Once one thought Lanceley’s Ethos,
back from a tour of the Continent
with the Recent Australian Painting
show, and composed of paint, rusted
tin, and plastic oddments, was a shouter,
but though it distressed unsophisticated
denizens of minor cities in Northern
Europe, it now looks quiet enough and
one sees how orthodox are its rhythms
beneath the flotsam and jetsam.
Gallery A has conceived an exhibition
of large works seen before as being suit-
able for public places —as they are —but
it is clear that seeing good works again
is not a question of deja-vu: the works
are re-seen and rediscovered. Lanceley’s
colored, solid wooden construction with
a white umbrella adumbrates his skit-
tish prints, recently at the Hungry
Horse, and the sado-masochistic quali-
ties of Hessing’s Cemetery of Days are
more apparent —a bit like Alan Davie’s
erotic forms seen through a romantic
mist. That Klippel’s sculpture of ascend-
ing wheels and rings so poised that they
seem about to rotate is made of dis-
carded parts now seems irrelevant; and

what once resembled a volte-face by
Reddington from his loose, frothing,
abstract impressionism to his brittle,
severe, and solid forms now tends to
look like a slight turn on the Redding-
ton highway. Rapotec’s slabby, grey
tree-trunk against an eroding golden-
brown sky, once explosively urgent, now
looks antique, especially against Janet
Dawson’s The Milky Way, where
streamers and patches of delicate and
luminous color pour centrifugally with
an asymmetric vitality and respect for
pictorial flatness that would please

ELWYN LYNN
THEATRE
Heady Albee
A Delicate Balance. Edward Albee.
Russell Street, Melbourne.
IN more cosmopolitan cities, theatre
is cruel one minute and absurd the
next, but does seem to sustain a
certain fevered brightness. In Mel-
bourne, most of the time, it is merely
a quaint convention, with about as
much relevance to the contemporary
scene as Morris dancing. Then, just
when you’ve attended the launching
of the dozenth lead balloon and are
entertaining the possibilities of more
heady distractions, along comes a play
which vindicates the medium single-
handed. And in recent years they’ve
usually been written by Edward Albee.
While “A Delicate Balance” hasn’t
the immediate impact of “Virginia
Woolf,” it has greater depth and
subtlety. The play is dominated by-
Agnes, a formidable and intelligent
American matron with an extraordinary
way of embroidering her words. Every
sentence is a consummate piece of
needlework, elaborate in design, fine in
execution and oppressively feminine.
Agnes talks continually, but not without
purpose, as she uses words in an attempt
to maintain her delicate balance—the
precarious stability within her threat-
ened home. Her sister, Claire, is a
middle-aged drunk, who in contrast to
Agnes keeps up the slurred patter of a
nightclub comic. And Tobias, Agnes’
husband, says very little at all.
While the trio live with their prob-
lems rather than each other, at least
it’s home. The balance is endangered
by new arrivals. Henry and Edna are
nominally Agnes and Tobias’ best
friends. But, like many social friend-
ships, the relationship is based mainly
on habit. Yet, when Henry and Edna
are suddenly and literally terrified by
the emptiness of their lives, they seek
haven in their friends’ home. Tobias
and Agnes make an effort to accept
this state of affairs, but their daughter,
who arrives home following the failure
of her fourth marriage, bitterly resents
the intrusion. Regressing into hysteri-
cal childhood, she demands that they
leave. But the guests insist that their
lifelong friendship gives them “rights.”
(One wonders how “friends” in the
audience were feeling.)
The third act finds the imperious
Agnes strangely quiet, as she insists
the time has come for her husband to
make decisions. She has, she believes,
become a matriarch by default, in that
all her life she has abided by Tobias’
non-decisions. Now their non-friends
have arrived bringing with them their
nameless terrors, and she insists that
Tobias makes the decision as to
whether or not they stay, or whether
or not the daughter stays. She gives
no indication of what she expects, and
under the pressure of this silence Tobias
disintegrates. The play ends as it
begins, with Agnes embroidering
thoughts on the remote possibility of
her going mad, and Tobias mixing
Claire and himself a drink at the
cocktail cabinet that dominates the
stage like an altar.
The play is not simply about the
responsibilities of friendship. It is about
the difficulties of the selfish seeking
love. Albee’s characters nurse their
spiritual injuries and ignore the pains
of those around them. Yet, the drunken
sister, neurotic daughter, introspective
husband and father, and pseudo-friends
all demand understanding and love.
Richard Prins built a set that almost
smelt of being lived in. Twenty years
must have passed within its walls be-
fore the curtain rose. He deserves a
lot of credit for the play’s obsessive
atmosphere. Patricia Kennedy is an
actress of strongly characteristic and
often irritating mannerisms. But she
found her perfect role in Agnes, and
we’ll see few better performances this
year. Having praised Brian James ful-
somely in the past, I feel justified in
being very blunt on this occasion. His
performance was disastrous. Instead of
a middle-aged, middle-class introvert
he gestured throughout. By the time
he reached the outburst in Act 111,
he had nothing left him but a grotesque
apoplexy.
PHILLIP ADAMS
FILMS
Open Country
Duel At Diablo. Director, Ralph Nelson.
A Big Hand For The Little Lady.
Director, Fielder Cook.
The Oscar. Director, Russell Rouse.
ALL the ingredients of the standard
Western are used in “Duel At
Diablo”—the harsh desert country-
side, rendered lethal by an Indian
uprising, the ambush, the attack at
dawn, the group of antagonistic white
men—or rather non-Indians, since one
is a Negro-—forced into collaboration in
the face of danger. But director Ralph
Nelson serves up the old hotchpotch
with a new and piquant flavor.
Nelson, who gives promise of develop-
ing into an interesting and individual
director, has a direct and realistic
approach to his work. His uncompro-
mising view of human nature and
behaviour saved “Lilies Of The Field”
from being merely a pleasing fairytale,,
and in this new film there is an equally
clear recognition of the complication of
motives that influence behaviour. He
faces four-square the brutality of the
story. There is no romantic glorifying
of violence: knives draw blood, skin
cracks like roast pork after Indian tor-
ture by fire, and the man involved in
a brawl does not walk away as brisk
and unmarked as a male model.
Nelson is still feeling his way a little.
His subjective camera sequence of the
man dying of thirst is imaginative but
utterly out of character with the rest
of the treatment. Perhaps one of the
greatest dangers now is that he’ll be
taken too seriously.
You’d think you were set for another
conventional Western in “A Big Hand
For The Little Lady,” which opens with
shots of a wagon tearing across the
open plain at the breakneck pace that
horses in Westerns (but nowhere else)
can keep up 26 hours a day. But once
it has established what it is talking
about, which it takes an absurdly
long time to do, the film moves indoors
and stays there.
Actually, it would have made a cute
television play, with its superficial but
funny observations on human greed, its
O. Henryish twists of plot, and one hour
would have kept its director from
meandering. A quintet of rich West-
erners meet every year for a ritualistic
poker game; a stranger with gambling
fever joins in but has a heart attack
before finishing a big hand, which is
taken over by his loyal wife. Fielder
Cook tries desperately to get away from
the smoky card-room, but the sequences
there are the significant ones; Lee
Garmes’ charming photography tries at
intervals to add spaciousness to the
movie, but returns thankfuly to the
small group and the close-up a re-
warding task with faces like Jason
Robards, Joanne Woodward, Henry
Fonda, and Charles Bickford to look
at.
Alas, Holywood seems to have lost
its talent for making the best bad pic-
tures in the world. “The Oscar” isn’t
exuberantly entertaining, merely sour
and predictably bitchy. The story (told
in flashback, of course) is of an actor
of negligible talent, and undiscoverable
personal magnetism, who has clawed his
way to an Academy Award nomination.
My total lack of interest in the central
character —he isn’t even an anti-hero —
and my impatience at the gullibility of
his victims were hardly enough to purge
my soul with pity and terror or with
any emotion more elevated than a desire
(gratified some two-thirds of the way
through) to get up and go home.

PERTH FESTIVAL, THEATRE
Fresh Breeze
FOR its first three weeks, .Perth’s
Festival lay in the cultural dol-
drums, enthusiasm and interest
lapping only gently at her sides. Then
along came a fresh theatrical breeze,
Joan Littlewood’s London Theatre
Workshop creation “Oh, What a
Lovely War,” and suddenly the scene
became more cheerful.
Executive officer John Birman re-
fused to say if the Festival would
finish in the red or black, but said
there were “favorable” indications.
The Aboriginal dancers made a big
impact, culturally and socially, and
earned $ll,OOO. The Perth Regional
Ballet, giving a diverse program at the
University’s Sunken Garden, has drawn
enthusiastic crowds, while Festival
films, notably “The Pawnbroker” and
Olivier’s “Othello,” have done well.
But the big news of the final two
weeks was undoubtedly “Lovely War”
at the Playhouse. Publicity described
this show as “total theatre,” a now
worn and meaningless phrase. But for
this play the description is correct.
“Lovely War” is a tragedy. “Lovely
War” is a pacifist play.
Ten men. and four women dressed
in Pierrot costumes of the Great War
era performed a multitude of fast-
moving scenes splashed with tunes that
set old men with RSL lapel badges
foot-tapping in the aisles. But, as a
backdrop to the fun, slides of war
scenes, gassed men, trench warfare,
mud, horror, and death were flashed
beneath a moving news tape of rising
death tolls.
The incompetence, the wretched
uselessness of war gradually came
through. The audience began to laugh
less as the play progressed, shocked by
the realisation that the play was pre-
senting historical fact and not imagina-
tive fiction.
Next morning, newspapers headlined
stories of the rising Vietnam casualty
roll. Seen against a background of
Western Australian apathetic affluence,
“Lovely War” is a potent play with a
message for 1967, resurrecting fears that
history might yet repeat itself.
The production by Edgar Metcalfe
was, barring a little slackness in the
first half, world class. Metcalfe leaves
Perth soon for Britain after a three-
year stint that injected local theatre
with new life. “Theatre in W.A.?” he
said, “is a bloody awful profession.
Our standard compares favorably with
the best of English repertory but com-
munity leaders ignore us.”
Similar thoughts were voiced by
Birman’s offsider, lan Channell, who
announced his resignation as the Fes-
tival was ending. Channell was recruited
from the U.K., will go to the Eastern
States full of frustration after three
years in Perth and angry with the atti-
tude of the W.A. Government and
Perth City Council toward culture.

BOOKS
Hefner’s Lucky Dip
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Playboy Annual. Edited by Hugh
M. Hefner. Souvenir Press. $7.35.
THE first 300-odd pages of this
volume are a raucous fanfare
for the libido.
Early in the book we are inundated
with Helen Gurley Brown’s inane in-
sinuations about “Sex and the Office.”
(Surely Helen Gurley Brown must win
the prize for the most crashing sexual
bore of the century?) We are also
subjected to an article entitled “The
Literati of the Four-Letter Word,” by
Leslie Fiedler, an article as bad as it
sounds, in which the author waves a
pretentious cloak of literary criticism
to sneak in a lot of coy smut. Fiedler
and Mrs. Brown deserve to be roped
together in the same bed to see who
eats whom.
Mixed in with the erotic junk are
some good pieces: notably a .savage
and seamy tale by Calder Willingham:
“Bus Story,” an icy evocation of a
seduction. “Anthony from Afar,” by
Bernard Wolfe, is the moving account
of a man who is unable to make the
grade socially or otherwise in Holly-
wood, and whose handsome and inanely
smiling face conceals a despair and
lack of confidence which eventually
lead to suicide.
John Clellon Holmes’ article, en-
titled “Revolution Below the Belt,” is
a very fair article about sex: he derides
learned critics who affirm in the wit-
ness box that “Lady Chatterley’s Lover”
is not sexually arousing because it is
a work of art. He questions whether
erotic literature can harm a person,
anyway. Admittedly, he goes off the
beam when he says that the release
of sexual energy from the “darkest
cellars of the consciousness” may cause
a revolution through which modern
man may become whole again. This
sublimation of thwarted religious
drives into sexual expression seems to
me just as dangerous as sublimating
sex into non-sexual activities.
Another significant article is by
Alfred Kazin: “The Love Cult.” He
attacks the misuse of love, both in the
spiritual and physical sense, as a
panacea for the ills of the world. He
points out that love has been made an
obligation rather than a discovery by
“psychiatrists and counsellors and min-
isters saying ‘Love, you monsters!
Love, dammit all, love! Do you want
to rock the boat and destroy us all?’ ”
Without specifically referring to it, he
has a hit at Auden’s famous line “We
must love one another or die.” It is a
pretty poor state of affairs when human
beings embrace a concept of brotherly
love merely to save their own skins.
Love, he says, has become security, a
status symbol, in a universe increas-
ingly devoid of meaning and spiritual
significance. Modern man is trying to
place on personal relationships a
weight which is too heavy for them to
bear. Meaninglessness does not become
' any more palatable by being shared
meaninglessness.
There are interviews with Schweitzer,
Martin Luther King, and Nabokov.
Schweitzer emerges as a rather windy,
moralistic old bore full of the “Love,
you monsters!” bit satirised by Kazin.
It is too good to miss quoting: “Apart
from that there is the bomb. I want,
before I die to see all atomic weapons
banned, no matter who makes them or
what especial name they give them.
This is the only possible hope for man-
kind if we are to avoid self-destruction.
Already I have fought against this in-
sanity for several years with my friend
Bertrand Russell and others.” One point
that all the hate-the-bombers steer clear
of it is that without the fear of the
bomb there probably would have been
a major global war between America
and Russia years ago.
Bertrand Russell has a fairly sound
and predictable article later in the book
entitled “The Conflicting Ideologies of
East and West,” in which, among
other things, he tells us he sent a tele-
gram to Khrushchev at the time of
the Cuba crisis, begging him not to
attack. Nikita sent a reply and took
Russell’s advice. Actually one wonders
just how much the cause for peace is
assisted by these famous, windy old
voices, using world peace as a horse to
ride their egos on.
But the interview with Martin
Luther King goes much better, and he
emerges as an impressive figure. Per-
haps his youth assists him, but far more
feeling for actual people comes out of
his interview than emerges from the
mouths of some of the old warriors for
peace. The interview with Nabokov goes
well, also. An impressive, intelligent,
and modest man, whose conversation on
paper has all the dexterity of his writ-
ing, manipulating words like precision-
timed glass puppets. If only all the
contributors to “Playboy” were as
agreeable!

man Army and the Nazi Party, 1933-
39. Robert J. O’Neill. Cassell. $9.20.
THE debate on the German
generals’ role in Hitler’s Third
Reich continues. It began in the
early ’fifties with the historians Sir
John Wheeler-Bennett and Professor
Gordon A. Craig; it later obtained a
new impetus through the memoirs and
biographies of several German key
figures. Now it has been resumed by
a young Australian Army officer and
Rhodes Scholar, who spent two years
Adolf Hitler
of intense research in Oxford on the
relations between the Nazis and the
generals before World War 11.
The author has interviewed some of
the surviving generals, including Hai-
der, Manstein, and Speidel; he has also
drawn on the valuable unpublished
papers of Field-Marshal von Weichs,
now deposited with the German Federal
Archives, and has added many excellent
photographs.
Dr. O’Neill is less concerned with
individual pen-portraits of pro-Nazi
and anti-Nazi officers than with the
basic relationship between Party and
Army. How did it happen that the
Army from being an obstacle to Hitler’s
ruthless policies of aggression became
in the end his obedient tool? How was
it possible that the generals did not see
through the Fuhrer’s deceptive vtiles
and subterfuges? They were no match
for Himmler’s and Goering’s sinister
intrigues which, for instance, enforced
the retirement of General von Fritsch,
the Commander-in-Chief, on an entirely
groundless charge of homosexual mis-
demeanor. (Though eventually a mili-
tary court acquitted Fritsch “on the
ground of proven innocence,” the news
was never published, and in spite of
pressure put on Hitler by some of
Fritsch’s colleagues no complete
rehabilitation was ever granted.)
During the first fifteen months of
the Nazi regime the Army was


threatened by the growing ambitions
of Roehm’s Stormtroopers, the para-
military Brownshirts. There is evidence
that Roehm wanted to relegate the
Army to a mere “training school for
the German people.” In a letter to the
generals in February, 1934, he boasted
that “the conduct of war, and there-
fore of mobilisation as well in future,”
was “the task of the S.A.” Five months
later Roehm was shot on Hitler’s orders
and the outcome of the purge of June
30 decided the power struggle in favor
of the Army, for which the Fuhrer had
far-reaching plans.
In those early years generals like
the impulsive von Blomberg and the
ambitious Reichenau concerned them-
selves mainly with the adaptation of
the Army to the Nazi Government,
whereas others such as the old-type
conservatives Fritsch and Beck devoted
themselves to the rapid increase of
the size and the standards of efficiency
in the Army. When these two groups
clashed, Hitler often reacted as an
onlooker, sometimes as an adjudicator,
until in the end he broke them both
imposing his iron will.
While the conservative elements
among the generals hesitated and
fumbled, the expansion of the Army
soon meant the influx of thousands of
recruits and junior officers indoctrinated
by the Party or the Hitler Youth.
When the Fuhrer brought off his coups
in the Rhineland in 1936 and in Aus-
tria two years later, these younger
people were impressed by the enthusias-
tic reception given to the Army by the
masses. At the same time they were
oblivious to the terrible dangers of a
major war which still haunted the
memories of some generals. Yet even
they did not realise the “dreadful
significance” of the transfer of the
Supreme Command from the senile
but honorable President von Hinden-
burg to the dynamic and unscrupulous
Hitler. In fact, for some years the con-
centration of the major political power
in the hands of one man and of the
obligation of the Army to his will
largely escaped the notice of the senior
officers of the German Army.
During the first few years of his rule
Hitler did not interfere with the
strategic planning and the organisa-
tional work of the Army leaders. But
when, in 1936, he succeeded with the
sudden reoccupation of the Rhineland
against their advice he began to
despise their cautious reluctance. After
the enforced resignation of von Blom-
berg, Hitler abolished the post of
Minister of Defence and made himself
Supreme Commander with the inferior
General Keitel as Chief of the High
Command of the Armed Forces. Keitel
simply abandoned his loyalty to the
Army in favor of the Party and acted
as Hitler’s devoted and unquestioning
tool “Lakaitel” (Lackey-Keitel), as
some of his more critical colleagues
used to dub him.
When, in May, 1938, Hitler gave the
Army leaders his firm intention to deal
with Czechoslovakia by force by Octo-
ber 1, General Jodi 'commented in his
diary: “The whole contrast becomes
acute once more between the Fuhrer’s
intention that we must do it this year
and the opinion of the Army that we
cannot do it yet, as most certainly the
Western Powers will interfere and we
are not yet equal to them.” But Hitler
pushed their half-hearted resistance
aside, and by mid-August drew their
attention to his prophetic gifts, pre-
dicting that as long as Chamberlain
and Daladier were in power there would
be no European war over the fate of
Czechoslovakia.
After this General Ludwig Beck, the
Chief of the Army General Staff, sub-
mitted his resignation to the Army
Commander -in - Chief, General
Brauchitsch, whom he had tried in
vain to win over for a united opposi-
tion to Hitler by the Army leaders.
Beck, who six years later was to play
a tragic role in the abortive onslaught
on Hitler’s life, realised that there must
be limits to military obedience when
it meant obeying orders that could only
ruin the nation.
The bulk of the generals were com-
petent technicians, afflicted with a high
degree of blindness in political affairs,
Dr. O’Neill takes a more lenient view
of their attitude than some other his-
torians. He points out that “they
simply lacked the necessary sensory
organs to see that the nature of the
Third Reich had made the Army the
only possible final arbiter to Hitler.”
While agreeing that the crux of the
matter lay in the training of the Ger-
man officers he does not regard this a
matter for censure, “for what nation,”
he argues, “has ever prepared its
soldiers to deal with the civil govern-
ment whenever it should act in a man-
ner which the soldiers judge to be
contrary to the national interest?”
A combination of factors determined
the history of the German generals
before World War II as one of missed
opportunities, of frustration, and
fatality. Few people familiar with the
period will be inclined to quarrel with
Dr. O’Neill’s final verdict: “The forces
acting on the Nazi Party enabled it to
pursue its own policy with little need
for compromise with the Army, while
the Army was subject to an over-
whelming number of influences which
combined on many levels to make it
subservient to its political master.”

Collected Poems. Louis MacNeice.
Faber. $6.60.
BY any standards Louis MacNeice
was an enormously productive
writer. His collected poems alone
—without his radio plays, his prose
works and criticism, his translations
from Goethe and Aeschylus —run to 600
pages of closely but not meanly
printed pages, and this fine new
edition doesn’t gather together all the
poems that MacNeice wrote. His loyal
editor, E. R. Dodds, has simply chosen
to preserve that part of his lyric out-
put which MacNeice himself is known
to have most highly valued. “Collected
Poems” supersedes an earlier collected
volume and adds to it the five books
that go from “Ten Burnt Offerings”
(1952) to “The Burning Perch” (1963),
the volume that ' appeared a few
months before MacNeice’s death. Much
previously unpublished work is included.
MacNeice’s productivity is insepar-
able from his subject matter and his
style. He quickly freed himself from
the tinkling Sitwellisms of his juvenilia
and “Blind Fireworks” (“The lugu-
brious, salubrious seaside” and other
such pieces surely owe something to
“Facade”) and his characteristic tone
of voice emerges as early as 1926.
One of his youngest poems begins:
Trains came threading through my
dozing childhood,
Gentle murmurs nosing through a
summer quietude,
Drawing in and out, in and out, their
smoky ribbons,
Parting now and then, and launching
full-rigged galleons
And scrolls of smoke that hung in a
shifting epitaph,
while one of his very last poems begins:
It does not come round in hundreds
of thousands of years,
It comes round in the split of a wink,
you will he sitting exactly
Where you are now and scratching
your elbow, the train
Will be passing exactly as now and
saying It does not come round,
It does not come round . . .
The use of language here has hardly
changed over 35 years, and very little
of the view. Both are relaxed and
casual. One might say that MacNeice
is a poet with a voice and a vocabulary
which at their best fuse to become a
style.
MacNeice’s language has none of
the concentration of a Mallarme or a
Hopkins, and his view of reality is as
easily inclusive as Eliot’s, say, is ex-
clusive. Hardly any historical event of
the time goes unrecorded in his verse,
either directly or indirectly, and more
than any other poet of his generation
he has the novelist’s eye, where Auden
has the brilliant intellectual’s mind and
the moralist’s instinctive knowledge
for the right moment for the message.
This book shows clearly enough that
MacNeice could write about anything.
Donegal, India, Iceland, Italy, his pri-
vate life, his friends: the list on this
level is as long as the contents of the
book. Most subjects seem to have been
available to his imagination, probably

because so few were rooted in fear or
any other psychic tensions. He doesn’t
seem to have had to fight against an
excess of sensibility, gentility, or inhi-
bitions of any kind to win his poems’
subjects. Consequently, there is little
sense of growth and development in his
work beyond the processes of aging;
no sense of drying out or of sudden
waves of expansion and development.
Only, in his duller moments, of a highly
and easily sociable soul growing garru-
lous and rather long-winded and
muddling and muffled. MacNeice is as
uncommitted as- far as subject matter
goes as he was apparently uncommitted
politically in the ’thirties. But certain
themes recur, some subjects pre-
dominate.
If he, too, frequently asserts that life
is the great thing, “and that dying
had better be left to take care of itself
in the end,” it is, nevertheless, the per-
vasive sense of latent peril and
imminent loss that so finely tempers
his excellent last poems, and especially
“Charon,” a poem whose strength is
gained from MacNeice’s refusal to
sacrifice his characteristic tone and
manner (“If you want to die you will
have to pay for it”). The auto-
biographical element binds his work
together, though he is the poet of atti-
tudes rather than of experience; a poet,
like so many of the moderns, of state-
ment.
LIKE all prolific poets, MacNeice is
an uneven writer, sometimes simply
slapdash, sometimes sluggish, sometimes
repetitious. In art everything has to be
paid for, and MacNeice paid for his
fluency with facility and a rambling
discursiveness that robbed some of his
work of energy and clarity. The decline
that set in at one stage of his career
can be seen by comparing “Autumn
Journal” (1938): —still one of the best
and perhaps most underrated poems
the ’thirties produced—with its sequel,
written fifteen years later. “Autumn
Journal” is full of living detail and
sharp pieces of observation. Its tone is
one of relaxed control:
And now the wood pigeon starts
again denying
The values of the town
And a car having crossed the hill
accelerates, changes
Up, having just changed down.
And a train begins to chug and I
wonder what the morning
Paper will say,
And decide to go quickly to sleep
for the morning already
Is with us, the day is today.
That is the ending of section 5, but
one can open the poem at any point
and lines of a similar freshness and
individuality will impinge on the mind:
My dog, a symbol of the abandoned
order,
Lies on the carriage floor,
Her eyes inept and glamorous as a
film star’s,
Who wants to live, i.e., wants more
Presents, jewellery, furs, gadgets,
solicitations
As if to live were not

Its sequel is amiable enough for
those who can take all kinds of poetry
in their stride; but it lacks clarity and
cleanness of impact, and it is not one
of the poems on which MacNeice’s
reputation will rest.
MacNeice remains after Auden the
finest poet that the ’thirties produced.
He lacks Auden’s way with words, his
idiosyncratic brilliance, and the back-
ground of ideas of his verse is thinner.
But his artistic impurity—like Auden’s
—is a source of his strength in the way
that Mallarme’s or Stevens’ aesthetic
purity is a source of their weaknesses.
He is best remembered by “Autumn
Journal,” the famous shorter lyrics like
“The Sunlight on the Garden,” “Bag-
pipe Music,” “Prayer Before Birth,”
“Cradle Song for Eleanor” among the
early pieces, and among the later work
“Charon,” “The Habits,” and “Thal-
assa,” and not only because it is the
last poem MacNeice is known to have
written. One of his most characteristic
best-known lyrics is “Snow” and it
could well serve as an epigraph to his
whole work:
World is crazier and more of it than
we think,
Incorrigibly plural. I peel and por-
tion
A tangerine and spit the pips and
feel
The drunkenness of things being

Teacher in Distress
By JOHN BAXTER
The Joys of Possession. Ray Mathew.
Chapman and Hall. $3.85.
ANYONE who has lived for more
than a month in one of the more
parochial Australian country
towns need not be told that, for a
schoolteacher, existence there is one step
removed from hell. Still retaining some
shreds of student idealism, he finds
himself chained to a social and educa-
tional system diametrically opposed to
all he has been led to believe is worth
achieving. An outsider both by his own
instincts and the wishes of the com-
munity, he is, nevertheless, expected to
occupy a set and severely circumscribed
social position. The system of teacher
placement used in this country is one of
the more iniquitous examples of
bureaucracy rampant and there is prob-
ably a good novel in the effect that it
can have on a complex and sensitive
character. Unfortunately, “The Joys of
Possession” is not it.
Although the author has had some
experience as a teacher, the main
character in his novel bears little
resemblance to any known variety of
educator. Posted direct from Sydney to
a minute country town, James Thomp-
son soon becomes embroiled in its com-
plex social life, managing to become
the object of the affections of Edna
Kruse, wife of the town’s major citi-
zen, and the lover of her “companion,”
Judith Pearse. The story wanders more
or less aimlessly through a visit to Syd-
ney, a brutal abortion for Judith and
a great deal of intricate social chatter
without seeming to get anywhere.
Thompson carries on a voluminous but
unrequited correspondence with a girl
in Sydney and there are long conversa-
tions with some faceless country folk, -
but the general effect is one of mooning
motionlessness. It comes as something
of a shock, therefore, when the last
chapter brings us a maniacal multiple
homicide with sexual perversion thrown
in, like the obscene tag line to an
unfunny dirty joke.
All this is told in the sort of careless,
half-conversational language which one
had hoped was now largely abandoned
by both stage and novel to the TV
melodramas. “The Joys Of Possession”
reads, in fact, like a rather dated play,
a sort of Chekhov-in-the-Bush. “He wore
a suit and tie in a town of summer shirt-
sleeves. Above his collar—starched—he
was sweating, gracefully; a handker-
chief, hidden in his fist, dabbed him
dry . . . ‘James! Yes, yes —James, I do
like to know my boys by their first
names. Friends—that’s what a young
teacher needs . . ” Even the prose
reads like stage directions, and the set-
tings have the stiff, faded look of
amateur backdrops.
One looks in vain in Mr. Mathew’s
book for any of the ruthless intensity
that illuminated Kenneth Cook’s “Wake
In Fright,” in which a similar character
and premise were examined with skill
and insight. Cook evoked the genuine
terror felt by the intellectual faced with
a world he neither knows nor under-
stands, the basic suspicion of people
who work with their hands about those
who do not. Perhaps Mr. Mathew- has
been away too long from the country,
from teaching and from the sort of
people he writes of. (He has certainly
been away a long time from the world
of procuring abortions—his details here
are circa 1945 and lamentably out of
date.) A little more accuracy in details
such as this and “The Joys Of
Possession” might have been better, but
even this would have done little to save
what is basically an empty and sterile
work.

Mocking at Union
THE 14-months-old N.Z.-Australia Free Trade Agree-
ment has disappointed the hopes of its promoters and
confirmed the doubts of its critics. As a step toward
eventual economic union between the two countries, it has
so far proved a mockery. Far from working to redress the
heavy balance of commodity trade against N.Z. in a year
when this was sorely needed, the scales tipped slightly the
other way. Total trade between the two countries edged only
an inch higher, in trading air fouled by acrimonious squab-
bling between cross-Tasman commercial paper and pulp
interests which the respective Governments should have
stifled at the start.
Last week the Ministers of Trade of the two countries
were trying to get a belated solution to the squabble, which
is clogging up the development of trade in forestry pro-
ducts the main area for which the agreement is framed
to get a big expansion. Also, in an effort to widen the num-
ber of industries coming within the scope of the agreement,
Australia is now to allow its Minister of Customs and
Excise to permit at his discretion the entry under by-law of
goods from New Zealand whether they are included in the
schedule to the agreement or not. N.Z. will offer similar
facilities for by-law entry.
How will this work out in terms of trade expansion? On
the face of it, the chief beneficiaries look likely to be N.Z.
exporters of manufactured goods, because whereas our own
manufacturers will continue to be stuck by N.Z.’s rigid
import licensing system, N.Z.’s will face no such obstacle in
exporting to Australia. On the other hand, it does nothing
to facilitate the entry of N.Z. rural products to the Aus-
tralian market. This must be done sooner or later if N.Z. is-
to get the most out of the agreement. The N.Z. trade mis-
sion here now may proudly display its manufactured wares
with accompanying statistics around the Australian capitals,
but really its chances of capturing much of the Australian
market are pretty slim. It is not just a question of their high
cost output in a country of short production runs. N.Z.
manufacturers would do much more business here if the
Dominion had a more realistic exchange rate. In Australian
currency terms the general level of N.Z. export prices is too
high.
The leader of the mission may well say that it is tougher
for N.Z. manufacturers to penetrate the Australian than the
U.S. market, but then the U.S. dollar and the N.Z. pound
are birds of a feather. They are both over-valued in terms
of our dollar. The other side of the coin is that Australian
exports are cheap in N.Z. currency terms, and this makes
N.Z. an easy market for us. Put in terms of tourism, for
example, New Zealanders, benefiting by getting more Aus-
tralian dollars for their pound than they deserve, can travel
and holiday here for a song, whereas in terms of Australian
currency our tourists in N.Z. have to pay the earth for
everything. N.Z. could do more export business and reap a
much bigger harvest from Australia from visible exports
as well as tourist income if the pound’s value were cut.
"Peaceful" Competition
FREE enterprise has always been a rather ridiculous
slogan. Business has always accepted that it has to work
within the context of a set of laws aimed at preventing
people from engaging in robbery and fraud. Beyond this it
has increasingly accepted the necessity for an economy in
MEN AND MATTERS
THE retirement last month of 93-
year-old Percy Hunter as chair-
man of Southgate Investments
and the decision last week of 85-year-
old Mr. James Burns to step down as
managing director, while retaining the
chair of Burns Philp (following only a
few months after octogenarian Mr.
Joseph Mitchell retired as general
manager) have not robbed the over-
eighty brigade of all their top jobs in
Australian public companies.
At 82, and still presiding over the
group of as many electrically connected
companies he founded fifty years ago,
Mr. Oliver J. Nilsen now reigns un-
challenged as the grand old man of
Australian company chairmen. There
is no hint of his handing over at Oliver
J. Nilsen Ltd., either. When he does,
the line of succession in the business is
secure. His son, Mr. O. V. A. Nilsen,
now in his late fifties, is managing
director of the parent and other com-
panies, and his grandson John, a mere
boy by these age posts, is manager of
the South Australian subsidiary. Also
closely connected is Melbourne legalite
C. G. Hooper, a director of the parent
company and also chairman of J. C.
Williamson Ltd., who has been a friend
of O. V. A.’s since his Melbourne
University days.
Le Grand Pere has admittedly been
cutting back his business activities in re-
cent years, but
apparently more
his business than
other interests,
which range
widely over club
and sporting
lands, Rotary and
the Danish com-
munity. He re-
tired from the
Melbourne City
Council (he was
Lord Mayor in
1951 - 52) two
years ago and also from Neon Electric
Signs, which he started in 1936.
Mr. James Burns’ retirement as man-
aging director of Burns Philp will give
him a bit more time to add to the
three days a week he already spends on
his Bowral property “doing a laborer’s
job.”
AT the other end of the age scale, a
spectacular young developer
named Alan Bond was behind the
recent share flurry of Perth’s old estab-
lished music house, Musgroyes. His
takeover talks were prompted partly
by the company’s headquarters being fh
a part of the city ripe for drastic re-
development, and partly by his grow-
ing organisations’ need for a public
company base. But all was shelved

while Bond announced his latest scheme
—building a new office block on Saint
George’s Terrace as part of a s2m.
plus building plan by his companies.
Bond, the 29-year-old principal of
Progress Development Organisation,
came out from England at 13 and
started as a signwriter, setting up his
first company in this field at 19. He was
Australia’s Jaycee delegate at the Paris
convention in 1959, and followed this by
a world tour, where he picked up some
of his real-estate ideas. On his return to
the West he bought 200 blocks in the
hills and within a few months had built
a name as the State’s boldest and most
controversial developer. His flair
attracted the interest of a number of
British investors—as well as the ire of
many Perth realtors and town planners.


which there is a degree of public ownership and a large
element of overall planning of incomes, of the level of
economic activity, of the directions in which the economy
develops. There will be disagreement in matters of detail
whether particular measures are right or wrong, go too far
or not far enough. But there is agreement with the prin-
ciple except on the unimportant political extremes
that some sacrifice in individual economic freedoms is neces-
sary in order to gain the greater advantages which derive
from pragmatic, carefully conceived public policies of con-
trol and intervention.
If there remains, however, any sense in the free enterprise
slogan, it refers to the way .in which business is conducted
within the context of these laws and policies. It should mean
business competition free of mollycoddling restraints, organ-
ised by established groups. That, of course, is how Americans,
who popularised the term, saw it.
There are too many signs of stupid fear of competition
and a failure to take this sort of free enterprise seriously.
Last week, to take a small example, we were told by the
Tobacco Trade Council that the so-called “price war” in
cigarette retailing had simmered down. The prospect of a
beautiful price-peace presumably lies on the horizon. Behind
these loaded terms lie a whole heap of silly prejudices as well
as an unjustified defence of vested interests.
When it comes to trade negotiations, New Zealand’s pro-
tective instincts are sure to be pandered to as well. So they
were indeed in the arrangements made in Wellington last
week. Disputed markets are to be shared out by bargaining
between companies rather than by competition in the market-
place. Mr. McEwen complained about New Zealand pro-
ducers wanting to “rock the boat” in Australia. The audacity
of these people, trying to take advantage of the fact that
they can produce things like trees and milk products more
efficiently and cheaply! But to criticise these strange restric-
tive arrangements for forest products is not to say there
was no progress in the talks generally. The possible widen-
ing of the scope of the agreement as a whole is most* wel-
come. It is soon to be applied to the motor industry and
possibly chemicals.
A Little Knowledge . . .
THE Dutch Philips company’s takeover of Pye of Cam-
bridge (which incidentally gives Philips a very large
stake in the Australian electrical industry) underlines
the point that stock exchanges, unlike a statutory body, are
powerless to take effective action against companies when
they get their legs pulled.
The London Stock Exchange had asked Philips how they
had suddenly appeared just before Christmas as the holder
of almost 10 million shares in Pye when they had denied
any share buying on their behalf only a little while before.
In summary, the letter (which should be read in full for
its best effect) said that although Philips told some North
American brokers earlier in 1966 that it “might be inter-
ested” in acquiring large blocks of Pye shares, it did not give
them specific instructions.
Philips told these brokers that it had no objection to their
trying to buy a large holding of Pye “on behalf of certain
financial institutions known by them to be on friendly terms
with us” and “we realised . . . that we might incur some
moral obligation to these institutions.” And because of the
business relationship between Philips and these groups, “if
one of us acted in a manner which inter alia assisted the
other then ... it would be understood between us that if any
loss was incurred . . . the other party would take this into
account at a later date, probably in connection with another
business transaction.”
Philips claim that while they had “some knowledge” of
the building up of this holding, they had no idea of its
magnitude until the shares were offered to it on December
23. And so it could say “no” when asked if it had been
buying. Business morality can be interesting.

and station wagons running last September, a registra-
tion analysis disclosed . . . Some 2039 fully assembled
motor vehicles were imported in January, value $2.9m.
the biggest number since 3124 in June last year.
Retailers may be going along with the better motor
vehicle situation: January’s retail sales, seasonally
adjusted, rose 8 percent above those for January, 1966,
on the same number of shopping days.
The trading banks’ new and increased lending com-
mitments reached a peak $1365.7m. in 1966, 23 per-
cent more than 1965; February (1967) commitments
averaged $25.9m. a week, against January’s $23.1m. .. .
Savings bank deposits added $40.3m. in January (they
rose $18.7m. in January, 1966) to total $5511.7m.
The all groups export price index at December, 1966,
was 3.7 percent lower than at the previous December;
wool, sugar, and metals proving the worst offenders . . .
Wool prices held during the latest week, although there’s
a trend toward buyers’ favor.
For the markets: Many industrials (especially
automotives and electricals) certainly appeared a little
firmer as Australian share markets closed last week. Yet
this finishing sprint could scarcely disguise the con-
tinued, quiet, general retreat on fairly moderate turn-
overs. Special situations, like Email and Bellambi from
opposite sides, play their expected part. Metals remain
decidedly patchy.
A modest degree of cheerfulness has brightened
London, on rather light dealings, however. British Motor
Corporation is after 3000 workers . . . Wall Street
again looks mixed on very selective trading; the market
is seeking more economic incentives.
For companies: Personalities, for a change,
stole a few of the headlines ... At Burns Philp, 85-
year-old Mr. James Burns decided to relinquish his
managing directorship and to continue as chairman, a
position he has occupied since 1922 . . . Following the
death of Sir Reginald Fogarty, Carlton and United
Breweries’ chairman and general manager, Melbourne
solicitor Mr. Edward Cohen becomes chairman, and an
old brewing hand, Mr. Brian Breheny, general manager.
Most of the giants were absent from the reporting
field, with exceptions from the retailers . . . The expense
of new developments did not* deter Myer Emporium
from higher earnings and bigger sales in the half-year to
January . . . Tax losses from its Marcus Clark take-
over helped Waltons to record profits of $2,296,713 in
the same period; store-for-store sales showed a marked
increase . . . Adelaide’s Miller Anderson, in which Wal-
tons now has an interest, recovered strongly, but not
enough for an interim dividend . . . Tenders for the
sale of Cox Bros, closed to the tune of an $BOO,OOO loss
in the first half of 1966-67, double that for the first
half of 1965-66 ... In Sydney, Winns is earning slightly
more, while Buckinghams holds last year’s levels with-
out being able to venture any interim payment.
Not remaining entirely silent, BHP announced the
building of a s4m. tar distilling plant at Newcastle, in
association with U.S.A.’s Koppers Co. . . . The steel
group’s new Port Kembla blast furnace will be com-
missioned in 1971, not 1968.
Petrol marketer H. C. Sleigh is buying, for about
s6m., U.S.-owned Phillips Oil Products and will gain
about 100 service stations; Phillips’ liquefied petroleum
gas section may be sold by Sleigh to Shell Oil of Aus-
tralia.
The shippers sounded somewhat divided . . . Better
results for Adelaide Steamship were aided particularly
by subsidiary improvements, notably from Adelaide
Ship Construction ... A loss by the 60 percent owned
Associated Steamships meant an. overall drop for
Mcllwraith McEacharn; most of its other sections are
improving . . . Howard Smith, with, of course, many

diverse activities, is holding a 10 percent dividend for
1966.
One major financier kept the pot boiling . . . Normal
earnings from the Ajax insurance subsidiary, whose
profit went from $369,112 to $686,142, brought lAC
(Holdings) up by 12£ percent to a peak $5,062,944;
dividend goes from 11 5-6 to 12 percent . . . Mer-
chant banker and investor Development Underwriting
pushed its interim from to 4 percent when six
months’ profit went from $111,014 to $124,145
Vehicle and General Insurance saw lower earnings fol-
lowing unfavorable claims and will await the full year
for a dividend.
Coming right out of the blue, electrical equipment
and appliance maker Email thought it necessary to give
early advice of a doubled profit for 1966 (at about
$1.4m., the best since 1960); the final dividend is now
eagerly awaited . . . Doubling talk comes also from
Simpson Pope in Adelaide a half-year’s earnings of
$526,000 against $234,806, after very small tax and
various lighter provisions; the dividend waits.
It’s looking up, too, for Olympic Consolidated Indus-
tries, 15 percent ahead of the comparable December,
1965, earnings . . . Car forging sales lagged for Aus-
tralian National Industries and directors don’t predict
much improvement; seven months’ profit fell slightly on
6 percent lower turnover from the group.
Builder E. A. Watts Holdings appears likely to pay
an enhanced 12 percent dividend for 1966-67; the in-
terim has become 6 percent and the first half’s turnovers
moved up . ... “Package” designer and constructor
Paynter and Dixon expects another good year, indicat-
ing such by bringing the interim from 8 to 8£ percent.
“Housing imbalance” between the States is supplier
John Mcllwraith’s phrase to explain why the year’s
profit won t advance . . . Carrier Air Conditioning has
fetched dividend rate from 9 to 10 percent by a 5 per-
cent interim, anticipates a favorable current year, but is
prudently restrained about 1967-68 . : . A lower result
for 1966-67 is actually forecast by Johns Hydraulics, yet
without affecting the 10 percent dividend ... A bevy of
timber merchants, Vanderfield and Reid, Duncan’s, and
Softwood Holdings, chorus poor results; Melbourne’s
Timber Holdings, though, earned more on lower sales.
So far as British Tobacco seems concerned, the food
front never stands still: its offer for Golden Poultry
Farming Industries, worth $2.25m., is being considered
by GP’s directors . . . Results from ice-cream and pie
maker Toppa Holdings may have given British Tobacco
pause lower profits led to a passed dividend . .
Competition did not retard Queenslander Provincial
Traders; group sales climbed 13 percent to permit a
“higher” level of earnings and confirmation of an 11
percent dividend rate . . . Chicago’s Beatrice Foods is
acquiring part of Henry Berry’s confectionery and food
subsidiary Red Tulip Investments.
Rayon yarn maker Courtaulds could only earn
$669,559 in 1966, representing 4.9 percent on capital;
it manages a 4 percent payout . . . Carpet Manufacturers
is already preparing for a higher 1966-67 dividend on
better sales and profits.
Extractors are few, but choice . . . Esso Exploration
and Production Aust. proposes a four-well drilling pro-
gram on an Oil Search Papuan farmout . . . Tin and
wolfram miner Aberfoyle has returned with a 1\ percent

Stocking-up for a Boom?
By CROESUS
AFTER a subdued performance for
most of last year, industrial pro-
duction has picked up well in
recent months. Allowing for seasonal
influences, the last few monthly output
figures were very good indeed, that is,
with a few notable exceptions like build-
ing industry materials. The rising trend
also looks to have a strong momentum
in improved business confidence and
freer retail spending, which have
prompted some economists to go in
boots and all in forecasting a swift
return to buoyancy in the economy.
In last week’s issue I raised the
question whether lagging private invest-
ment might put a brake on the
upswing. Now, what about the possible
influence of stocks rebuilding in the
recent rise in industrial production and
the prospects for its going into much
higher ground this year? As in con-
sidering the outlook for private invest-
ment, in the case of stocks we come
up against a paucity of statistics.
Obscurities in the area of measur-
ing and forecasting the marginal effi-
ciency of capital, seen in last week’s
exercise as the key to forecasting fixed
private investment, are grave enough.
No wonder they deter our statisticians.
They are not alone in this, according
to “The Economist” of February 25,
which made the following observation
in an article jibing the U.K. Govern-
ment on its relative neglect of private
investment: “In countries like Japan
the planners clatter out on their com-
puters complicated estimates of the
productivity of new capital investment
in the various sectors of the public and
private domain; in Whitehall nobody
has any idea about the marginal pro-
ductivity of capital anywhere!”
Surely the difficulties in measuring
stocks are not nearly as formidable as
for the marginal efficiency of capital.
Yet, in confronting this exercise in sift-
ing out the effect of stock movements,
we find that where the field of statistics
for stocks is not bare, its crops are too
out of date to be much use. At present
we have no official industry-by-industry
figures for stocks, not even any up-to-
date ones for industry in general. The
best the authorities can manage is a
quarterly figure for what they call “non-
farm stocks.” The latest of these to
come out of Canberra is for the Septem-
ber quarter last year, now many months
old (I understand the December quar-
ter figure is due any day now). It is
high time we had a monthly national
picture of stocks, issued with the
monthly production figures, to include
stocks being carried by wholesale and
retail trades, as well as by each indus-
try. I’m reaching for the moon.
Meantime, down on earth, I have to
settle for a private enterprise job done
by the ever useful Australian Industries
Development Association, which once a
year turns its statistical armory on to
the published accounts of public com-
panies to extract the figures for stocks
and compare them with yesteryear’s.
The resulting synopsis, covering a series
of industries, is admittedly sadly out of
date. The one for 1966 to reach me
this week refers mostly to companies
(about 700 in all), whose latest stocks
figures relate to June 30 last year, that
is, eight months ago. Not much use, you
say, to economists looking for clues to
industrial trends over 1967 in figures
for output these past few months. Yes,
but a good many of the companies in
the sample did report later than June
30, which would bring the average date
a little nearer the present than that.
I’ve always had my doubts about
the usefulness of this AIDA annual
survey of stocks but, faut de mieux, it
is a straw, the only one we have to-
dutch at, anyway, for industry-by-
industry details of stocks movements.
Also, apart from the figures, AIDA’s
interpretation and projects are always
relevant. Its general finding this time
is not as startling as some of the details
given for the 19 industrial groups. It
confirms what the official figures for
non-farm stocks tell us, that last year,
when factory production increased at
only one-third the rate for 1965,
stockbuilding was the lightest since
1962, a poor year for the economy. Last
year’s increase of only 4J percent for
the whole sample of 702 companies

compared with a rise of 13 percent the
previous year, from a rather bigger
sample. Taking account of the 44 per-
cent increase in the wholesale price
index over the year, and also of the fact
that many companies in the sample
valued stocks at cost, a rough calcu-
lation suggests that the quantum of
stocks could have increased very little,
if at all, last year. On a per capita
basis it would seem to have fallen.
Many observers don't look on either
the slower growths in stocks or the
lull in the economy last year as all
that tragic. Some, such as AIDA, see
the present lowish stock level through
rose-coloured glasses. It says that stocks
probably started to build up in the
second half of 1966 but went down
in the Christmas spending rush. It
considers most industries would have
started off 1967 “with not much more
than essentials to keep activities
moving at a cautious rate.” In that
case, it thinks that “once there is any
indication of a return to confidence in
the economy, restocking should add to
an upsurge of productive activity.”
That is definite enough for anybody,
though it is surprising, perhaps, that
AIDA has not yet sensed the return of
confidence being hailed by so many
people. It could have added, of course,
that stockbuilding could also have a
lifting effect on imports. Like industrial
production, these have crept up to well
above the level of a year ago and could
bear careful watching later on if the
economic going gets as good as the
optimists think.
bearing in mind that the
figures are not representative of the
full calendar year 1966, the variations
from 1965 stocks experiences in the
various industrial groups hold useful
clues, or at least confirmation, for
evidence from other sources (for stock-
brokers, say) of where the biggest rises
in output and profits are likely to come
in a full-throated upsurge in the
economy.
As one might expect, the biggest
reversal of the 1965 stocks trend was in
the motor industry. Whereas stocks of
the distributors of vehicles and parts
increased by 19.1 percent in 1965, they
dropped by 2.5 percent last year. On
the motor manufacturing side, stocks
actually increased a shade (by .5 per-
cent) in 1966, but they’d risen by 12.3
percent the previous year. Other big
swingers were machinery, machine tools,
etc., from plus 26.2 to minus .2 percent;
paper from plus 14.7 to minus .2 per-
cent, electrical equipment from plus
14.2 to minus .1 percent, and “other
metalworks” from plus 24 to plus 3.4
percent. Overall, the stocks experience
of the non-manufacturing groups (in-
cluding retail motor distribution and
wholesale, woolbrokers, pastoral, ship-
ping, and mining) has about the same
experience as manufacturers’. The varia-
tion in the stocks of the non-
manufacturers was plus 11.4 to plus 4.6
percent, and for the manufacturers from
plus 13.7 to plus 4.4 percent.


Bargains among the Retailers
WILD CAT

MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
LOOK at the retailers! They are
all doing a lot better (except for
the Cox group, which hardly
counts these days), and seem certain to
do a lot better yet once consumer
spending really begins to move again.
Last week’s interim report from Myers
that directors expected group net profit
to rise despite having to absorb the
pre-opening expenses of the Northlands
and Burwood shopping centres, along
with the bullish news from Waltons, fol-
lowed the previous week’s profit in-
creases from Grace Bros.
Despite its appeal for all followers of
the counter-cyclical buying theory, this
is a group that the stockmarket still
does not like at any price. Apart from
a lift from Waltons shares on the re-
sult (but they are still very low his-
torically), share prices for the big re-
tailers are still at bargain-basement
levels. This is an ideal situation for the
long-term investor. For the latest im-
provements have taken place when the
trade is still unnaturally tough (look
at appliances).
The Myer result could suggest some
recovery in profit margins following
the previous year's cut. It follows the
chairman’s, comment last November
that sales were up 4.8 percent in the
first quarter, but it is understood that
the group had a fairly happy Christmas,
which may have done quite a lot for
profits.
NOT even the market’s continued
uneasiness about Waltons’ guaran-
tee of the “difficult” debts of the
FNCB-Waltons Credit Corporation
could stop the shares rising 8 cents on
the announcement of the group’s one-
third profit rise for the January half-
year. Even though the good news of a
$560,000 profit rise was due entirely to
a $l.l million cut in the tax bill, there
is far more to it than simply a big
tax saving because of the Waltons take-
over of Marcus Clark’s huge $4 million
tax losses.
A look at the pre-tax picture shows
that Waltons did quite well without
all these accounting changes. The lat-
est half-year (which includes the peak
Christmas and New Year sales periods)
resulted in a pre-tax profit of $2.47
million compared with $2.86 million in
the previous year. In the first place,
now that the Credit Corporation is no
longer consolidated, Waltons only re-
ceived a dividend from it. The effect
of this on the figures is significant.
The latest pre-tax profit would have
been $2.97 million had the Credit Cor-
poration been consolidated into the
accounts as in the previous year. And
that would have meant a $llO,OOO rise
in the company’s pre-tax profit, despite
all the costs of acquisition of Marcus
Clark which were met out of the half-
year’s profit. This is only a modest 4
percent rise, but at least would have
indicated the group was doing better.
But this is having your cake and
eating it, too. Half the Credit Corpora-
tion has been sold, and the money has
presumably been earning cash in the
meantime. In fact, the company only
benefited from Waltons Credit Corpora-
tion to the tune of $195,000 in tax-free
dividends, instead of $700,000-odd in
pre-tax profit; its “share” of FNCB-
Waltons’ pre-tax profit would have
been about $350,000.
In effect, the sale of half of the
Credit Corporation has meant that
Waltons put in a pre-tax result that
was down about $230,000, including
Waltons’ share of the Credit Corpora-
tion’s tax which is not a bad result
at all. And the Marcus Clark tax
losses are going to keep Waltons’ net
profits looking good for quite some
time. As it is, the latest result gives a
percent earning rate on the com-
pany’s capital, which was increased last
year by a heavy note conversion. As
we said at the time, the company’s 12J
percent dividend does not look to be
in danger.
But apart from all that, the Marcus
Clark stores could even be a moderate
contributor to profit themselves; their
sales have jumped by a quarter under
Waltons’ control. But the market
would no doubt like to hear how Wal-
tons’ Melbourne headquarters store is
going; Mr. John Walton junior went
down to Melbourne some time ago to
solve some problems there.
The Waltons group, more than any
other major retailer, stands to do best
out of any future return to overtime
working in industry, as its customers
are almost entirely wage earners. So
the market in its shares will no doubt
be keenly tuned to official statistics on
this subject; unfortunately, the latest
employment figures are far from cheer-
ing. But if the economic recovery does
ever gather momentum, overtime
figures should increase.
PROVINCIAL TRADERS has a
habit of being in a newsworthy
industry, even if it is not in the
news itself. Market disappointment that
Provincial did not receive any increase
in its margarine quota at the recent
Agricultural Council meeting can now
be offset by the good result the com-
pany announced last week. And the
British Tobacco takeover bid for
Golden Poultry could suggest all sorts
of interesting propositions about Pro-
vincial Traders, whose “Dixie” chickens
The Chartist says:
INVESTORS who were happily “riding home on the pig’s back” in 1964 and
1965, when the share price of ANDERSON MEAT INDUSTRIES LTD. rose
to a high point of 85c, must feel anxious now they are travelling downhill.
Already prices have fallen to 37c during the past week, close to the first target
of 38c, which coincides with the 1962 support level. The overall top suggests that
they could decline even further to approximately 30c, where support would be
forthcoming from the range of trading in that area during 1961/62. The past history
of this stock shows very sharp declines and reactions, and the current position
indicates an extremely weak technical situation with market strength well below
average, which should be avoided by investors. A long period of consolidation
around the base levels will most probably precede any recovery. Once again this
stock illustrates the value of selling on the break of the steep 85 percent intermediate
uptrend during March, 1965. Last sale price on 3/3/67 —37c.

make up a large proportion of the
broiler trade.
On the other hand, British Tobacco’s
extension of its existing interests in
the broiler business (giving it domin-
ance in Victoria and W.A.) could mean
the same sort of uncomfortable period
for other members of the industry as
has happened in the ice-cream war.
And takeovers are cheaper when rivals
have been run into the ground. Pro-
vincial is in an intriguing position what-
ever happens.
General industries, the
Metters group, is certainly looking
like the odd man out in its end of
the appliance business. Email’s doubled
profits, Simpson Pope’s “solid progress,” .
and the excellent result from Malleys
suggest that things may be getting bet-
ter in this industry than the 20 percent
profit fall from General Industries indi-
cates.
But General Industries had done a bit
better than expected in the previous
year, so the situation may have been
self-correcting. The Email result, in
which the previous year’s savage profit
fall has been more than made good,
clearly indicates an improvement in the
industry (as well as some long overdue
reorganising within the group). The
previous year’s fall had been due to un-
satisfactory results in hhme appliances
and industrial air-conditioning.
It is also clear that things have been
much improved in air-conditioning, but
no matter how improved the market
may appear at the moment, the Carrier
Air Conditioning interim report (that
also came out last week) carries a warn-
ing about the future along with its in-
creased dividend, higher half-year profit
and expectations of a better result for
the full year. The company’s comment
that, in view of the postponement of a
number of major construction jobs, the
order intake for 1967-68 may be less
than was expected earlier is most sig-
nificant and not only for rival air-
conditioning contractors like Email.
If big building projects are being
“postponed,” it could be that some of
the listed building companies may face
a leaner time, along, with those com-
panies that have been doing so well
out of the high level of non-housing
construction. Paynter and Dixon’s
higher half-year profit and dividend
was despite a lower value of work
carried out. But E. A. Watts is still full
of orders, and has decided to increase
its dividend, too.

Long Views in a Quiet Period
By PELIAS in Melbourne
FOR those with a short-term view
of the market, this is not the best
time of the year to be recommend-
ing shares; those individuals who are
self-employed or of independent means
are getting their tax bills and to raise
the necessary cash they are selling out
some of their market holdings - or
are using any ready cash to pay tax
rather than brokers. And it is a dull
period for market news, too, as March
sees the end of the interim report season
and news or expectations of the full
year’s result do not arouse the market
for some months. The market always
performs weakly during this period
if it doesn’t actually fall, it at least
levels out after rising strongly before-
hand: this was the case in 1961 and
1963. For 1967 it has already shown
a downtrend; it has been drifting grad-
ually lower since the second week in
January and there does not seem to be
much resilience. Not that there are
many sellers; it is just that there are
few buyers.
So any stock is likely to fall and not
regain its price until May or June. But
this fall in the market usually presents
some bargains for investors with a
longer view. One solution seems to be
to select stocks which have already
fallen or are historically low (self-
employed taxpayers and everyone else
prefer making a profit to a loss if they
are raising money to pay bills), or to
concentrate on stocks that are in a clear-
cut recovery situation (apart from what
should theoretically be relatively high
buying pressure, sellers will be reluctant
to liquidate their holdings if they seem
sure of increasing in value within a few
months).
One of the companies in the latter
category is Dural Leeds Holdings Ltd.
The 50 cent shares sold as high as $2.50
in 1964. Last year they fell to 90 cents
after the release of the disappointing
1965-66 results and since then they have
recovered to the present level of $1.12.
The severe 1965-66 setback, a result of
slackness in the building industry, cut
earning rate about 10 percent to 23.1
percent. The recovery expected in the
current year should restore earning rate
to the level where it will again provide
a double cover for the 15 percent divi-
dend. This would warrant a higher price
for the shares, which are currently yield-
ing high at 6.7 percent.
The interim report from the group
said sales were 10 percent better in the
December half, while profit- showed a
larger rate of increase. The result
apparently covered the full year’s divi-
dend requirement. The company makes
blinds and awnings, aluminium ware
and plumbers’ fittings. The latter
activity, being connected with copper
prices, is the one doubtful spot in the
group. Variable copper prices affected
this activity in 1965-66 and could well
do so again this year. However, any set-
backs would be easily offset by the im-
provement in the more important opera-
tions and plumbing products, at worst,
could only take the top layer of cream
off the group’s recovery trend.
There should be some short- 01
medium-term gains in Shelton
Industries, toosetter and die-
maker. The 50 cent shares, floated off
at 65 cents each in 1965, are currently
fetching 84 cents on the market and
yielding an acceptable 6 percent from
the maiden 10 percent dividend. Profits
were steady in the first half of the cur-
rent year, but there seems no reason
why operations in the current half
should not give the full result a boost
and improve on the 1965-66 earning
rate of 23 percent.
The company services several indus-
tries; the largest swag of its business
comes from its operations as an auto-
motive engineer. The present and ap-
parently continuing recovery in the
automotive industry should send more
business Shelton’s way. The recent
interim report said there were extensive
orders on hand, implying that the order
book was fatter than at the same time
last year.
The group has been extending its
factory (at Huntingdale) to increase
efficiency and improve the flow of work.
The plant is already one of the most
modern of its type in Australia; its pro-
ducts are well known for their high
quality.
It would seem that earning rate this
year could be somewhere between 25
and 30 percent and, if so, a higher price
than that present ruling on the market
would be warranted. The extensive
cover for the dividend will leave plenty
of scope for an increase or for a cash
issue if directors decide to undertake
expansion, which seems inevitable for
this small but highly successful group.
The market has yet to evaluate Shelton’s
potential properly.
A STOCK which can hardly go
any lower is the long-stagnant
cotton spinner, weaver, and gar-
ment marker Davies Coop. The shares
have varied in the 25- to 30-cent level
for ages now and are currently buyable
at 29 cents. As they are 50-cent units,
the yield is an attractive 6.9 percent.
The company’s period of stagnation
appears to be over dividends'were
resumed last year at 4 percent, a
reorganisation and modernisation pro-
gram is substantially complete, and
profits should Abe higher this year.
In the December six months, net
profit dipped from $695,000 to
$507,000. Many shareholders failed to
take notice of the facts behind this
dip and the shares dropped to 25
cents before recovering again. In the

first place, the lower result was after
writing $130,000 off for non-recurring
expenses; in the second, it was after
a tax jump from $llO,OOO to $316,000;
in the third, full 1965-66 profit was
only $641,000 because of a tax jump in
the second half and a large provision
for future tax; finally, directors said
quite plainly that the full result in the
current year would exceed the previous
figure.
The half-yearly result represented
an annual 8.6 percent on capital. Earn-
ing rate in 1965-66 was 5.4 percent.
The chances of a dividend lift this
year are not remote. Moreover, the
company should start to see substanti-
ally higher profits from its reorganisa-
tion and modernisation soon. This has
involved the installation of highly
efficient weaving and dyeing equip-
ment, a concentration of increased
weaving production into only two mills,
and a general re-thinking by the board
on how to extricate the company from
its stagnant state.
They appear to be succeeding. The
group is definitely emerging again as
a fair profit-earner and dividend-payer.
It is hard for the market to recognise
or even believe this because the stock
has been such a hopelessly mediocre
performer for too long a time. It will
eventually wake up and investors who
, . , • , . i i
have bought in at the current level
will be able to reap their reward. At
such a low price, a mere two-cent
rise will return a profit after brokerage.
A NOTHER stock which could see
par before the year is out is
Brown & Dureau, basically an
importer and exporter. The $1 shares
jumped from 52 cents to more than 60
cents last week after the release of the
interim report, but they should setde
back (o cen , lev ' el> where they
w jp be g God buying. The company is
sure to pay a dividend this year, prob-
a bly fi ve percent, which was the distn-
bution for three years before the drastic
1965-66 loss forced an omission.
This was entirely caused by the un-
profitable operation and the closing
down of the weaving mill. In the latest
December six months, profits are known
to have exceeded the $ 150,000-odd
earned by all other divisions of the
group in the full 1965-66 year.
jf pro fits in the current half are at
the same level as in the December
period, earning rate for the full year is
going to come out somewhere between
25 and 30 percent, or more than double
anything the company has achieved for
years. This seems astounding, but it
must be remembered that the group will

*e 1965-66 loss. Hence, the situation
will be only temporary, but it should be
good enough t 0 take the shares back to
par
Whether they get that high or, not
wiU pro b a bly depend on the board’s
dividend policy for this abnormal year,
There is little doubt that the payout
will at least be resumed at five percent,
However, in view of the high earning
rate and the fact that shareholders have
missed out on a year’s dividends, direc-
tors may decide to make a much larger
payout. A fair figure, as far as share-
U o f ders are concerned, would, of
course, be 10 percent,
Whatever happens, there is little
doubt t h a t the shares will be fetching
f ar more than 60 cents in a few months,
The CO mp an y’s exit from the weaving
industry (if only because of the benefits

q£ losses and the improvement of
liquidity) would warrant a higher price,
j k e textile game is divorced from the
group’s main business and one in which,
as a sma ll. t ime operator, it should never
have been involved. The efforts of the
board should now start producing better
results than have been seen for some
time.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Whale Runs with the Wheat
WHEN the whales were running,
Whale Industries Ltd. used to
get in there and shoot like hell;
it is using the same techniques in its
new role as a farmer. But, instead of
whales it is wheat; it is putting every-
thing it has into wheat as hard as it can
go. It recently harvested Australia’s
biggest-ever wheat crop from one
property, it has been selling off cattle
and sheep in order to put more acres
under wheat, and it looks like riding
the Government-supported wheat situa-
tion as long and as hard as it can.
The big question is whether wheat
can continue to be a sensible proposi-
tion, for if the traditionally grazing men,
who switched to it for a quick cash
crop to tide themselves over after the
drought, decide to stay in wheat for as
long as it is worth while, there could be
a run of wheat surpluses sufficiently
embarrassing to force some official
action.
But while the wheat is running,
Whale Industries is going to run with
it for all it’s worth. And if wheat does
lose its appeal in a few years’ time, the
chances are that stock prices will have
subsided to reasonable enough levels
after the drought for Whale to build
up its cattle and sheep activities again.
In other words, given reasonable
seasons, Whale should be flexible
enough to do well, as it makes the most
of its farming opportunities.
Gurley Station, near Moree, was pur-
chased in July, 1959, as diversification
from the company’s original whaling
activities, which were obviously going
to terminate very shortly as the num-
bers of humpback whales diminished.
In good seasons, wheat, linseed, and
sorghum are grown, and sheep and
cattle run on the stubble and on the
land not farmed. There is no reason
why it could not all be farmed, and
present company policy is to increase
farming areas. To implement this, the
station held a reducing sale in February,
1967 (an unusual situation after a
drought), at which 8700 sheep were
sold at a satisfactory price. This re-
ducing policy was one reason the
1966-67 wool clip, sold at Newcastle in
September, was down from 390 bales,
grossing $61,000, to 320 bales, realising
$53,000 gross.
rpHE company normally regards Gur-
ley as being in a secure rainfall
area, but the 1965-66 drought was very
general in N.S.W. and few wheat and
grazing districts escaped. The drought
made sowing impossible in 1965-66,
when Whale suffered a large loss. Fairly,
widespread rains in mid-1966 allowed
farmers to plant wheat for a rapid
rescue of their financial position. Whale
planted 22,000 acres to wheat and
290 to linseed, which yielded 670,000
bushels of wheat (almost double the
1964 harvest from an acreage that had
gone up 50 percent), and 138 tons of
linseed (or about half that of 1964, the
last preceding harvest). This wheat yield
of 30 bushels to the acre was very good,
considering the lack of moisture in
the early part of the season and that
some new acreage was sown. A better
variety of seed, a new release of
Gamut, was planted.
The harvest, completed in Decem-
ber, could not be wholly accepted
immediately by the Grain Elevators
Board, whose receival and storage
facilities are inadequate, as Whale
directors constantly remind share-
holders. This, therefore, involves the
company in considerable expense for
its own storage, and delays in the
receipt of proceeds. To date, almost
80 percent of the wheat crop has been
delivered to the Board, and the bal-
ance should be delivered within the
next month. The estimated proceeds of
this crop, coming to hand in the cur-
rent financial year, are $620,000, net
of freight, Wheat Board and Grain
Elevators Board charges, and exclud-
ing future deferred payments. Whale,
naturally, incurred a loss for the first
half of the current year, as only a
small proportion of the 'wheat pro-
ceeds was included, and no valuation
was placed on the wheat and linseed
not delivered at December 31.
have issued a very full
interim report, forecasting a profit of
$275,000 after depreciation and tax for
the full year to June, 1967, which is
far more realistic than simply approv-
ing an unaudited loss of $56,931 for
the half-year to December 31, 1966.
They made no promises about a divi-
dend increase, but the earning rate
which that predicted profit represents,
18.3 percent on capital, clearly pro-
vides scope for a more generous hand-
out than the 5 percent of the past
three years.
Whale’s overdraft of only $BO,OOO at
1966 balance date, compared with a
cash position at 1965 balance date,
would have been the envy of most
drought-stricken farmers and graziers.
That overdraft will be well and truly
eliminated by the wheat proceeds.
Losses associated with winding up the
whaling activities depleted stockholders’
funds by $830,000, but the task was
completed by 1964 balance date and
the company is now solely a station
owner.
The 1962 loss of $441,000 was
followed by three modest profits, which
did not attract tax. The drought
created a loss of $144,000 in 1965-66,
cancelling out the previous year’s profit,
and increased tax losses to something
like $284,000. The projected profits for
1966-67 apparently would attract some
tax, and the company should be subject
to full tax liability in 1967-68.
Gurley is described by the Board as
probably the largest farming operation
of its type in Australia. With a couple
of good seasons under their belts, direc-
tors are likely to buy other properties
to expand operations. They would have
to do something with surplus funds,
and this is the alternative to paying it
all out to shareholders. In addition,
their present real estate is unencum-
bered and could provide substantial
loan funds for expansion. The possi-
bility of buying other stations is de-
terring Whale Industries Ltd. from
changing its name to something more
appropriate. Executives say that
“Gurley” would not be a suitable sub-
stitute for a name which misleads in-
vestors of short memories and new-
comers to the investment scene, if
additional stations were bought.
Meanwhile they are open to suggestions
of a more suitable name.
To justify the present market price
of par, the market appears to expect
a dividend of up to eight percent from
1966-67 profits, which would leave more
than half to be ploughed back.
The Chartist recommended Whale-
Industries at 42c last October, suggest-
ing a short to medium term projection
to 60c. This sort of level would prob-
ably need a 10 percent dividend rate,
which seems likely in the foreseeable
future. In the event, the shares climbed
to 57c before returning to their 50 cent
par, which is still a good haul from
the pit of 25c in December, 1965. The
recent interim report gives a firm un-
derpinning to the market. The pros-
pects look fair provided the seasons
are likewise.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Is Sleigh's Price Excessive?
IT is rather strange that three of the
five companies which were selected
as high-yielding leaders are depen-
dent on the transport industry and the
last two on road transport to a large
extent. It may be that this analogy is a
little strained, because we do not know
what proportion of Olympic’s and
H. C. Sleigh Ltd.’s customers are pri-
vate motorists. So far as Sleigh is con-
cerned, it is apparent that motor spirit
represented about one-third of Aus-
tralian refinery products and the next
single largest item in the list of pro-
ducts was furnace fuel. It would seem
then to be a fair guess that the most
important influence on the volume of
Sleigh’s sales is the number of motor
vehicles on the register.

Over the period that these statistics
cover, the market price has been cut
in half, dividends per share have been
reduced by 20 percent and earnings per
share by nearly 25 percent. Today the
shares are selling at 60 cents, which
would indicate a dividend yield of 8.3
percent, but because earnings and divi-
dends per share were identical in 1965/66
this means that the earnings yield was
also 8.3 percent. That is, the shares are
currently selling at 12 times 1965/66
earnings. As has been pointed out
before in respect of other stocks, there
are many analysts who would suggest
that, after such a record of declining
dividends and earnings, the price is
excessive if it exceeds ten times earn-
ings. A price which is 20 percent higher
than the maximum suggests that the
market generally is expecting a strong
improvement in the very near future.
;r pHE business was commenced in 1895
and at first took the form of a ship-
ping agency. However, from 1913 its
main activity has been the petroleum
division. The present public company
was formed in 1947.
Purr Pull Oil Industries was acquired
by an issue of shares in 1954; the com-
pany then seems to have avoided the
takeover field for five years. In the
latter quarter of' 1959, however, three
bids were made. Only the one, for
Hardie Rubber, was successful. Six
months later H. C. Sleigh was itself
the subject of a bid from its major
Australian competitor, Ampol Petro-
leum. This bid was rejected and shortly
afterward Sleigh issued ten million
deferred “B” shares to “overseas trade
associates.” An issue of deferred “A”
shares had been made in 1956, but the
“A” shares do not carry any voting
rights.
In 1965, following the conversion of
the 4.9 million notes into shares, another
ten million deferred “C” shares were
issued, and on this occasion it was indi-
cated that these shares had been issued
to Martin Properties Pty. Ltd., a wholly
owned subsidiary of California Texas
Oil Corporation.
As will be shown later, the issue of
these twenty million shares, with their
variable dividend rights in the future,
completely changed the investment
potential of H. C. Sleigh’s ordinary
shares.
The distribution of refined petroleum
products is the principal activity of the
H. C. Sleigh group. Since 1965 crude
oil has been purchased direct, with
Australian Oil Refining Ltd. refining it
under an agreement. H. C. Sleigh
also has a 25 percent interest in

an aeronautical division. The rubber
division now is only 30 percent owned
by H. C. Sleigh, as recently a 70 per-
cent interest was sold to the Lirestone
Tire and Rubber Company of U.S.A.
It would appear that the export
division accounted for about 17 percent
of the total group turnover in 1965/66,
but it is, of course, not possible to sug-
gest that a similar contribution was
made to group profit by this division.
In 1964/65, the sales of the Hardie
Rubber group represented nearly 27
percent of total group sales. From
these figures, one can only guess that
the petroleum division contributed
about 50 percent of total sales
revenue.
From gallonage figures given in the
company’s annual reports and the gal-
lonage figures produced by the Petro-
leum Information Bureau of total
Australian consumption of petroleum
products, it would appear that H. C.
Sleigh’s market share has been
declining:

Unfortunately, this is rather super-
ficial, for the figures for Australian
consumption include items such as
refinery fuel, bitumen, solvents and
other products, which it could be
assumed that H. C. Sleigh’s petroleum
division does not handle.
However, from the point of view of
assessing the future prospects, it seems
the possibility of H. C. Sleigh making
any significant inroads into the market
shares of its competitors is rather
remote. While the chairman of Ampol
has suggested that there will be an
increase in the prices of motor spirit
in the not too distant future, the fact
that price control still exists (and is
continued voluntarily in the States
where actual control was abandoned
many years ago) suggests that compe-
tition will still tend to limit any growth
in margins to the wholesaler.
Over the past five years, Australian
consumption of petroleum products has
been increasing at an average annual
compound rate of nearly 9 percent,
motor spirit at about 6J percent, and
vehicles on register at about 5J percent.
It seems likely that similar growth rates
can be expected for at least the next
five years.
The full implications of Sleigh’s s6m.
purchase of the Phillips Oil Products’
chain of service stations I shall consider
in my summary article next week.
UNFORTUNATELY, whichever way
you look at it, H. C. Sleigh’s overall
margin on sales has been steadily de-
clining over the past five years. Trading
revenue as a percentage of group sales
has fallen from 12.9 percent in 1961/62
to 9.8 percent in 1965/66, while net
profit before tax as a percentage of sales
has fallen from 7.3 to 4.1 percent. If
sales revenue is estimated to increase at
the rate of 9 percent per annum and the
decline in the trading revenue margin
continues, then actual trading revenue
in 1970/71 will be less than in 1965/66.
Reported earnings in 1965/66 were
$3,056,000 approximately, and there-
fore the dividend commitment was
covered about 1.2 times. The conver-
sion of notes in June, 1968, will add
about $243,000 to the 10 percent divi-
dend requirement from 1968/69 onward,
but the main increases will occur after
1970/71, when the “B” deferreds (from
July 1, 1971) and the “C” deferreds
(from July 1, 1972) may be converted
into ordinary shares, adding $1 million
to the 10 percent dividend commit-
ment.
The difficulty in seeing any prospec-
tive increase in dividends per share for
at least the next six years makes it
impossible to suggest that the shares are
underpriced at the present level of
around 60 cents. Investors should watch
the trends in per share earnings very
closely. In the first half of 1966/67, net
profit before tax increased by less than
4 percent on the previous corresponding
six months. This rate of increase will
need to be maintained for the next six
years if the 10 percent dividend rate is
not to be in danger from 1972/73
onwards.

Growth for Bowen Basin Coal
UNDER the stimulus of a rising
export market for coking coal, the
prospects of companies with hold-
ings in Queensland’s Bowen Basin coal
areas seem likely to attract considerable
attention. Since exports first began from
the Moura field to Japan, in 1961, they
have shown a steady increase and are
now running at about If million tons
per annum, or about one-fifth of Aus-
tralia’s total coking coal exports. Under
existing contracts, Bowen Basin exports
will reach six million tons by 1970 and
prospects for a further increase look
good.
Estimates of future Japanese require-
ments for imported coking coal vary
considerably. About the middle of last
year, the Japanese Ministry of Trade
and Information forecast that by 1970
the Japanese steel industry would
require between 21.5 and 23.1 million
tons of imported coal. Of this total,
Australia was expected to supply about
12 million tons, or around 52-55 per-
cent of import requirements. In
October last year, the Joint Coal Board
estimated Australia’s exports of coking
coal in 1970 at 13 million tons on the
basis of existing contracts. However,
Japanese steel industry authorities con-
sider these estimates to be conservative,
and a figure as high as 20 million tons
by 1970 has been mentioned.
Currently the supply position in
Japan is tight, with the U.S., previously
the major supplier, shipping a declining
proportion of Japanese requirements.
Japanese steel companies have been
turning to European countries for
urgent supplies, but these are considered
as essentially short-term stop-gap sup-
pliers, in view of the long distances and
high freight costs involved.
B Y comparison, Australian coking coal
can be landed in Japan at attrac-
tive prices. In this regard, Queensland
coal has the edge over N.S.W. sources,
not only because of the shorter dis-
tances involved, but also because of
lower rail-freight charges and a greater
use of cheaper open-cut mining
methods. One comparison of ocean
freight costs to Japan from Sydney and
Gladstone showed that the latter had
a 20-30 cents per ton advantage, de-
pending on the size of carrier em-
ployed.
Although the N.S.W. Railways offers
special concessions for export coal,
these are at a fixed rate; in Queensland,
rail charges are on a sliding scale
inverse to volume. When the new
Kianga - Moura - Gladstone railway is
completed in 1968, shortening the dis-
tance from 190 to 111 miles, the charge
for an annual haulage of two million
tons will be $2.65 per ton, falling to
$1.90 per ton when the annual rate
reaches three million tons. By compari-
son, the N.S.W. concession rate for
export coal hauled over 111 miles is
now fixed at $4.35 per ton.
In addition to the prospects for a
further growth in exports to Japan from
the Bowen Basin, the Joint Coal Board
believes that Queensland will play a
significant part in supplying the coking
coal requirements of a greatly expanded
and widely dispersed Australian iron
and steel industry. Current consumption
by the local steel industry is running
at over 6.5 million tons per annum; the
Joint Coal Board expects this to reach
9.5 million tons by 1970. BHP has fore-
cast a figure of around 12 million tons
by the mid-19705.
'J'HE scramble to secure prospective
coal areas in the Bowen Basin has
intensified over the past year. Eighteen
authorities to prospect and seven mining-
leases have now been taken out. In
attempting to assess the prospects of
particular companies with holdings in
the area, it must be remembered the
type of coal varies considerably. There
are large resources of low-volatile coals,
ranging from anthracites and semi-
anthracites through to hard and soft
coking coals. It is the medium-volatile
coking coals at Moura and Blackwater
which are currently being developed on
a large scale. This type of coal com-
mands a premium in. export markets
and constitutes the main coal import
requirement of the Japanese steel
industry.
Relatively small tonnages of soft
coking coal are now being mined at
Kianga, in the Bowen Basin. The
Japanese are now importing somewhat
less than two million tons of soft coking
coal per annum from New South Wales
to supplement local supplies. However,
prospects for growth of exports of this
type of coal are limited by comparison
with hard coking coals.
In addition to coking coals, smaller
tonnages of steam-raising coal are also
produced in the Bowen Basin, mainly
at Callide for the Calcap power station.
Additional coal of this type will be
required as the Collinsville power
station is brought into operation toward
1970 and as the capacity of Calcap is
expanded. In the Dawson Valley, Mount
Morgan Ltd. operates a colliery which
produces a non-coking coal for its own
smelter requirements. Mount Isa Mines
is also supplied with coal for its smelt-
ing operations by a subsidiary, Bowen
Consolidated Coal Mines Coal Ltd.,
which operates in the Collinsville dis-
trict.
To date, the development of the
Kianga-Moura coalfields since 1961 by
Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Coal Co. Pty.
Ltd. overshadows all other operations
in the Bowen Basin. In addition to
its 13-year contract for the delivery
of 29.7 million tons of Moura hard
coking coal to Japanese steel mills
from April, 1965, the company signed
a further contract in December, 1966,
for the delivery of 15 million tons over
a ten-year period commencing April,
1968. Annual contract deliveries will
then rise to 4.5 million tons.
Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui Coal is
owned by Peabody Coal Co. of
America (58 percent), Mitsui and Co.
Ltd. of Japan (20 percent), and Thiess
Holding Ltd. (22 percent). Thiess
originally owned the Kianga-Moura
leases and, under the terms of the sales
agreement, it receives an agency fee

of 20 cents on each ton of coal pro-
duced in excess of 600,000 tons. This
agency fee will rise to $780,000 when
throughput reaches 4.5 million tons.
However, due to development costs
and loan commitments, TPM may not
be in a position to pay dividends to
its three shareholders until around
1970. At this stage it seems reasonable
to expect that net profit will exceed
$1 per ton of coal sold.
Additional contracts would increase
the profitability of the venture, al-
though further capital expenditure
would be required ,to develop addi-
tional capacity. The chairman of
TPM, on his return from Japan last
December, stated that Japan’s steel
industry had asked his company to be
prepared for a production of 8 to 10
million tons annually, or double exist-
ing contract requirements after 1968.
In order to supply such require-
ments, the company is considering the
possible development of a coalfield in
the Ramsay area north of Moura, and
production of semi-hard coking coal
from a deposit near the Kianga soft-
coking coalmine, in addition to in-
creasing output from Moura by both
open-cut and underground mining. In-
cidentally, TPM also hold a contract
to supply around 250,000-300,000 tons
of coal a year to Queensland Alumina
Ltd., commencing this year.
'J'FIE other major hard coking coal-
mine in the Bowen Basin is at present
being developed by an American com-
pany, Utah Construction and Mining
Co., which holds a 10-year contract to
supply 13J million tons to Japan, be-
ginning next year. Utah is also a one-
third partner in the Mount Golds-
worthy iron ore project, but there has
been no indication of Australian par-
ticipation in the Blackwater project.
Other listed companies wfiich hold
authorities to prospect for coal in the
Bowen Basin include BHP, the Asso-
ciated Oil Group (through its mining
division), Bellambi Coal, Mount Mor-
gan (in partnership with Coal and
Allied Industries). BHP, which holds
a 70-square-mile prospect near Black-
water, has expressed optimism about its
prospects of discovering high-grade
coking coals, but considers that years
of test drilling will be needed to prove
the deposits.
The Associated Oil Group has been
granted five authorities to prospect for
coal in the Bowen Basin, at Tfieodore,
Bluff, Gibihi, Dingo, and North Dingo.
The Theodore area (63 square miles)
is considered by the group to have out-
standing potential as a major source of
steaming coal for power generation at
Callide, and also in Southern Queens-
land. In the Bluff, Dingo, and North
Dingo areas, covering 320 square miles,
the Associated Group has been carry-
ing out exploration with Marubeni-
lida of Japan, which holds an option
over coal exports from these areas.
Boring surveys conducted to date have
indicated the possibility of large
reserves of low-volatile coal in the Bluff
and North Dingo areas, in the order of
70 million and 100 million tons respec-
tively. Bulk samples of these low-vola-
tile coals have been shipped overseas
to test their suitability for blending with
other coals used in the steel industry.
At Dingo, anthracite similar to that
found in North Vietnam exists. With
North Vietnamese supplies to Japan
now less dependable, the new source
at Dingo could be developed at an
early stage. The Gibihi prospect (58
square miles) is considered interesting
in view of. its location a few miles
south of Moura, but, to date, no reports
on testing of this prospect have been
issued.
As yet, no reports are available on
the likely results of testing being carried
out by Bellambi Coal in the Comet
and Bluff areas and the Mount
Morgan-Coal and Allied Industries
joint exploration venture in the
Baralba-North Dingo area. Bellambi
has a 1434-square-mile prospect near
Comet, and 14 square miles north-east
of Blackwater and north of Bluff,
Mount Morgan is the holder of the
730-square-mile prospect stretching
from Baralba to North Dingo.
COMMODITIES
Producer Buying in London
ALL four London Metal Exchange
base metals markets have been
receiving the attention of pro-
ducers’ buying agents recently. In the
case of tin the position is as before,
with the buffer stock manager holding
prices by his very presence, without the
need for actual buying.
Producer buying has been important
in zinc for many months, although pro-
duction cuts have reduced the need for
market operations recently.
In lead, heavy buying by producers
ran down stocks to such an extent that
prices quickly gained about £stg.s a
ton to £B3 at one stage. This technical
situation is not likely to last, however,
and producers will face heavier buying
if they wish to hold prices or slow the
rate of fall.
And, too, there have been widespread
reports that a producer has been buying
copper. This news was greeted with
considerable surprise, for copper prices
at present might be thought high
enough to please any producer. Cer-
tainly, though, copper has developed
marked weakness in the past few weeks.
As the basic position caused by heavy
U.S. and Chinese buying for military
use has not changed, there is a good
solid base for price support. Short-term
developments -helping copper down have
included the settlement of the Congo’s
dispute with Union Miniere and its
Belgian parent. This will free large
stocks of copper —said to total 80,000
tons —for shipment to consumers.
Cushioning the effects of the cut in
supplies, and so of the resumption, has
been the long supply pipeline between
mine and fabricator. Another bearish
point is the addition of several new loco-
motives to Zambia’s rail system.
TANTALUM ore prices have con-
tinued to creep higher in Lon-
don this year, and are currently
quoted about 2000/- stg. a unit. This
is nicely above the level in November
about 1800/-.
The market range has narrowed from
240/- to 100/- This may reflect a
steadier trend. It has been forecast
that the market would level at around
2000/-, which is just under three times
the price ruling 18 months ago.
The main U.S. producer of tantalum
metal, Fansteel, recently raised prices
15 percent. The company pointed out
that use of tantalum has doubled within
the past three years. This reflects in-
creased demand from aerospace, chemi-
cal, and electronic industries.
Greenbushes Tin NL’s troubled West-
ern Australian operation is the main
local source of the mineral. The rapid
rise in prices since the company’s for-
mation has probably lifted tantalite into
first place, over tin, as its revenue
source;
THE conference of world sugar pro-
ducers and consumers in London
this week comes at a time when
the sugar market is gradually assuming
a new look. Although it would take a
brave man even to say that there will
definitely be a significant price rise
sometime this year, the outlook is
becoming more bullish.
The level of free market prices is
vital to Australian producers, despite
the fact that only a small proportion
of our sugar is actually sold on the
market. Many contract sales are also
at free market prices. In fact, the sales
to Japan, our largest customer, are
below the London market price.
The important factors this season will
, be Cuba’s crop and the world stock
position. If Cuba produces rather less
than expected, and stocks have been
reduced by sales for non-food purposes,
the market situation will change. Sugar
will bear watching.
ANNUAL world production of oil
has almost doubled in the past 10
years, rising 8.8 percent to 1697
million tons last year. The U.S. is
still by far the world’s largest single
producer with an output of 462
million tons last year.
North America supplied a total of
510 million tons, the Middle East 471
million tons, the Sino-Soviet area 292
million tons, Latin America 240 mil-
lion tons, Africa 129 million tons, and
the Far East and Asia 35 million tons.
A total of 54 countries now produce
significant quantities of oil.

The pattern’s becoming rather familiar a slowly wilting

of each week. The retreat still looks pretty evenly divided
among the main index sections. BHP has tried hard, but had
to give 2 cents to $6.28. On the way back G. E. Crane dropped
35 cents, finishing at $5, while Bellambi lost a heavy 25 cents
in reaching $1.45. Rothmans cannot hold: this time 16 cents
were taken off, bringing the price to $1.82. On reports, Email

The
Catholic
Church
...and Freedom
of Enquiry
The Church is always something of a
mystery and a paradox. From many aspects
it appears to be holy, yet from other aspects
it is seen to have many faults. The reason
for this is that the Church is at one and the
same time both human and divine. It is a
meeting place of God and man, and while
God and the things of God are holy, man
himself is often not.
We should be ashamed of faults within
the Church, but we should not be surprised
at them. They are the faults of men and
women who belong to it. Even the twelve
Apostles chosen by Christ were not without
their faults: one denied Him, another
betrayed Him.
Yet, with all the faults of its members
so evident, the Ghurch possesses the true
faith revealed by Christ. It has His
authority to teach men, to govern them, to
make them holy and to lead them to
eternal life. The Church makes this claim,
not in any partisan spirit, but from a genuine
desire to bring the Christian message of
salvation to all. The Church is infallible for
the very, reason that all its members are so
fallible and so capable of falling into error.
Nowadays thousands of people are look-
ing afresh at the teachings of the Church in
order to discover and to do the will of God.

MAN ON THE LAND
A Few Kinds of Dairy Subsidy
IN 1959, eight years ago, the Com-
monwealth Government set up a
committee of inquiry into the
dairying industry. The main recom-
mendation of this inquiry was that the
dairy subsidy should be “phased out”
over a period of 10 years and that
assistance to the industry should take
the form of improved research and
extension, and the provision of loans
to enable uneconomic producers to take
up some other activity. The 10-year
period is nearly over and the dairy
subsidy is to be renegotiated this year
in July.
The chances of the subsidy being
removed are, we would say, pretty
remote. Indeed, as things are, the choice
is between continuing it at the present
level (about $27 million a year) or
increasing it slightly.
We refer to the 1959 inquiry because
it is indicative of the entire farm
subsidy problem the world over. It is
a far, far easier thing to create a sub-
sidy than to remove one. Nearly always
the principal reasons for introducing a
subsidy become submerged and lost.
New reasons are found for continuation
and, let us be frank, the new reasons
are not always invalid. They are gen-
erated rather than invented.
The dairy subsidy (the $27 million)
is not, and never has been, the only
subsidy enjoyed by the dairy industry.
This needs to be said because there
appears to be a general idea among
the public that it is.
Two submissions from the industry
have been made to the Commonwealth
Government. One, from the Dairy
Industry Council, seeks continuation
of the subsidy at $27 million. The other,
from the Australian Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union, seeks to have it lifted
to about $36 million. This subsidy is
the direct one and dates from 1943.
From 1944 to 1950 it ranged between
$8 million and $l6 million a year. Since
1951 it has always been around the $27
million mark a year.
,r JPHIS direct subsidy came into being to
permit dairyfarmers to pay Arbitra-
tion Court award wages to employees.
With mechanisation and the change-
over to bulk handling, the number of
employees on farms has, in fact,
dropped since 1943. This has not had
any bearing on the rate of subsidy.
This, too, is a world-wide subsidy pat-
tern. The money which once went to
pay a farmhand goes to buy the
machine; some employee, in some
industry, somewhere benefits. This,
anyway, is how the argument becomes
rationalised.
In Australia, as in the United States
at an earlier period, the displaced farm-
hand, now an industrial worker, wants
to buy cheaper margarine and in time
his voice grows louder. Margarine
quotas in Australia are a second form
of subsidy for the dairying industry,
worth about $lO million a year at
least, and are probably the most vulner-
able from the farmers’ point of view.
Yet none of these things is really
the biggest subsidy to dairying. The
biggest subsidy, which is not a subsidy
from the farmers’ viewpoint, is the
butter equalisation system which dates
from 1926. This, basically, is the sys-
tem whereby the Australian consumer
pays a high price for butter to permit
exports to a world market which pays
a lower price. If it were not for butter
equalisation, the Australian consumer
could probably buy butter at around
35 cents a pound instead of 50 cents.
'J'HE foreign exchange earned by
butter, about $lOO million a year,
is one justification for this. There is
another reason which may or may not
be a justification. Without the butter
equalisation system the framework of
dairy industry organisation would alter
drastically. The Australian Dairy Pro-
duce Board itself and the various dairy-
farmer organisations have all been
created and fashioned on the assumption
that butter will be exported. More than
this, they have been created and
fashioned over the years on the assump-
tion that the London market will be
the principal export outlet.
The industry is not as unaware of
changing patterns in world trade as
some of its critics would infer. This is
why, probably, both the submissions
before the Federal Government in 1967
are considered, by some farmers, to be
“cap in hand.” The dairy organisation
leaders, however, are aware of what
could accompany a higher subsidy
demand.
It should be rather obvious that if
the Government is to continue to sub-
sidise the dairy industry heavily, then
some form of production quotas could
accompany the subsidy. Other countries,
notably the U.K. and the Scandinavian
countries, have quotas. A proposal on
quotas was made, in fact, by the 1959
committee of inquiry. Nothing came of
it but, presumably, the proposal is still
in the Government files and could be
produced. It provided that each farm’s
quota could be sold, along with the
farm (like a taxi licence), When the
farm changed hands. A newcomer to
dairying, if he thought he could make
a go of it, would simply have to buy a
quota plus farm or the quota itself,
without the farm, which he would be at
liberty to transfer to another farm.
This suggestion was rejected on the
ground that it would lead to undesirable
trafficking in quotas.
This would seem to imply that, dif-

Acuities in the industry nothwithstand-
ing, some farm quotas might have been
worth a great deal indeed. Some, true,
would have been worth a little or
nothing.
It can be taken for granted that
farmer organisations will resist quotas
with the same fervor that they seek sub-
sidies; in the case of dairying this might
be called having your butter and eating
it, too.
The recent butter versus margarine
controversy was very good for the public
relations firms engaged by the Dairy
Board and Marrickville Margarine
respectively (one of these PR firms
being an offshoot of the other, interest-
ingly enough), but both sides indulged
in a good deal of exaggeration. Like
wool and synthetics, butter and mar-
garine will have to learn to live with
each other. Neither has any moral or
ethical ascendancy over the other.
It is a hope, perhaps a forlorn one,
that both dairyfarmers and the Govern-
ment might give a thought to the idea
of cheaper butter on the home market.
Implementation of production quotas
as suggested by the 1959 report could,
in theory, bring this about, provided
the quotas allocated included an
accurate forecast of export demand and
price. It must be conceded that there
are plenty of ifs in this suggestion.
There is another one namely, the
extraordinary conclusion drawn from a
number of dairy industry surveys. These
surveys have shown, to the satisfaction
of the dairy industry which commis-
sioned them, that a reduction in the
home price of butter would not result
in increased consumption.
Why bother with these expensive
surveys? Why not put some NZ butter
on sale in the supermarkets at, say, 40
cents a lb. and see how it goes? As
dairyfarmers would want to lynch us for
saying this, if anything came of it, we
amend it to suggesting that they put
Australian butter on sale at the same
price, over a given period, to prove or
disprove the entrenched dairy industry
belief that lower home prices are no
solution to their problems.
JOUTTER equalisation itself comes in
two parts. The older part is the set-
ting of a high home price to permit sales
(or dumping, in the N.Z. view) over-
seas. The newer part is the Common-
wealth Government guarantee of a
final equalisation payment to the fac-
tories (mostly co-operatives), which
absolves them of the risk of over-
paying farmers following a world price
drop during the year’s trading opera-
tions. Is this a subsidy? It depends on
the point of view and, at any rate, is
flexible. It need not be a drain on
Government (taxpayer) funds if the
world price remains steady or rises.
Unfortunately the world trend in butter
prices seems downward.
Ignoring, in this exercise, the general
run of farmer subsidies which all
farmers, including dairyfarmers, enjoy
(superphosphate bounty, sales tax,
income tax benefits, etc.), the two sub-
missions from dairyfarmers come to
about the same thing in our view
roughly $6O million each. If this were
distributed equally, which it is not,
of course, it would mean that each
farmer gets about $2O per week. In
fact some get more and some less,
depending on production. Here we have
the heart of the subsidy problem: for
those genuinely uneconomic and im-
poverished small producers the subsidy,
irrespective of its overall size, is not
really of much assistance. In those areas
where poverty and distress exist, a
program unrelated to any commodity
marketing device may be more
appropriate.

The Costs of Mastitis
THE dairy subsidy, costing $27 mil-
lion a year, creates much talk.
Far less fuss has been generated
over the years by the udder disease
mastitis, which apparently costs an
equivalent, or even greater, sum. How-
ever, this subject seems likely to en-
gender plenty of hot discussion in the
near future. It is now recognised by
the veterinary science profession here
that the disease reduces a cow’s pro-
duction by at least ten percent and that
somewhere around one-third of the
dairy cows in Australia are infected at
any one time.
Surveys reveal a fairly wdde varia-
tion in incidence. That is to say the
disease is worse in some districts than
others and more cows are infected on
some farms than on others. But, be it
noted, the disease is not found on a
few' farms. One survey in the Brisbane
milk supply area showed that every herd
was infected and in some of the herds
every cow' diseased. The overall
average for the area was 46 percent of
cows infected. A Western Australian
survey produced a figure of 33 percent.
On the other hand, as mentioned, some
farms have a clean bill. For instance, a
study of farms in the Moss Vale district
of New' South Wales found that 14 per-
cent of the herds were mastitis-free.
More such surveys need to be done to
define the extent and precise incidence
of the distease. This is one of the re-
commendations of a special committee
appointed by the Australian Veterinary
Association. It w'ould like to develop
and promote a national policy for con-
trolling mastitis. The committee’s
report is published in full in last
month’s issue of the “Australian Vet-
erinary Journal.”
'J’HE idea seems to be that surveys
would turn in such shocking findings
that farmers would be moved to apply
more diligently the existing, proved
control measures. Also, they would
provide State authorities with irrefut-
able facts and solid arguments to lay
before Treasury officials. With more
money, State Departments of Agricul-
ture, for instance, could furnish better
diagnostic facilities, appoint staff speci-
fically to assist in and develop control
projects, and launch a massive “farmer
education” campaign.
On the lack of laboratories the com-
mittee’s report is blunt: “It is impos-
sible to contemplate appreciable con-
trol of mastitis wdthout increasing
laboratory facilities of the bacteriologi-
cal examination of milk. There seems no
valid reason for withholding such facili-
ties, which may be best arranged on a
regional basis.” To the non-veterinarian
reader it is not altogether clear how
the proposed regional diagnostic labor-
atories would be used to assist in con-
trolling the disease. How'ever, there is
a dark hint buried further down in
the report that they could be used to
police some sort of penal system. “If
the farmer is faced with the possible
rejection of unsuitable milk, he will,
of necessity, become more mastitis con-
scious, and his co-operation will, in most
cases, be ensured,” the committee exults.
Why it should be desirable to pena-
lise a dairyfarmer whose cows unfor-
tunately have mastitis is not clear,
either. It seems rather like kicking a
man when he is down. The farmer
has already lost ten percent of the
total potential production of each
infected cow. Elsewhere, the report
mentions that mastitis in dairy cows
cannot be said to constitute a public
health hazard. On this matter the com-
mittee ends up lamely remarking that
a high cell content in milk is “aestheti-
cally undesirable.” But as the old say-
ing has it: “What the eye doesn’t see
the heart doesn’t grieve over nor the
stomach worry about.” The vets them-
selves admit that it is quite impossible
to suppress mastitis completely. The
report does point out that sub-cfinical
infections, which also severely curtail
a cow’s production, are common. Since
the farmer cannot detect these cases,
the proposed regional laboratories
would be able to locate them for him.
The farmer-education angle would
seem to be the more, reasonable ap-
proach to the problem or it may
even be tackled more effectively by in-
creasing the dairy subsidy. This would
enable the farmer to employ more
hands or better-quality labor without
reducing further his already lowly stan-
dard of living. One of the main rea-
sons why mastitis is not under effec-
tive control at present is because each
man is required to milk too many cows
at once. As a result, he doesn’t have
enough time to apply thoroughly the
several necessary hygienic and other
precautionary measures. Milking-shed
procedures for preventing the frequent
occurrence of mastitis were devised years
ago. Dairy scientists are happy with
them and some farmers at least under-
stand them, e.g., about 14 percent of
the farmers around Moss Vale are ap-
parently milking their cows in the ap-
proved manner.
More money and effort need not be
spent researching the disease. Greater
awareness of how much mastitis costs
wmuld probably provide most of the
motivation needed to cause farmers to
practise the routines rigorously enough
to achieve an acceptable level of suc-
cess. If further impetus be needed,
“Mrs. Jones” and the margarine in-
terests will surely give it. Moreover,
synthetic “milks” and “creams” at
competitive pi ices are now freely avail-
able on the shelves of American super-
markets. It is presumably only a matter
of time before the Australian house-
wife will have these alternatives offered
to her also.

TEKKE-KHATCHLI
From the Persian-Russ : an border comes
th : s classic rug. Called KHATCHLI
(CROSS) because of the cruciform panel-
ling and used for hanging over the en-
trance to nomadic tents (yurts) it is
ideal for all modern and traditional
decors.
EVERY ORIENTAL
CARPET HAS A
STORY TO TELL
When you next view an Oriental rug
study it, closely. It is no ordinary
carpet, but a handwoven original,
as individual as the weaver who
made it. It reflects both the person-
ality of the weaver and the charac-
teristics of the place where it was
made. Those rugs woven by the
nomads who wander the lonely
spaces in north-east Iran combine
simple geometric forms and deep,
sombre colors os the bold, colorfui
weaves of the Kashgai tribes reflect
the sun-baked plains of the south.
The graceful floral forms of those
elegant jewel-colored rugs from the
cities are symbolic of a garden in
an arid land.
We stock only carpets made under
authentic conditions. You'll find
one to fit your individual story,
whether you pay $BO or $4OOO. each
chosen for its particular merit. If

LETTERS
Singapore Opposition
Mr. Bonavia’s article in your issue
of February 11 should have been
entitled “Should Singapore Have An
Opposition?” instead of “Singapore
Without Opposition?” for the writer
makes the categorical statement that
“There is today no effective, organ-
ised political Opposition in Singapore.”
And if the title had been rephrased
one would expect a search for the basis
of an Opposition, rather than the as-
sumption that the reason for the lack
of an Opposition must lie in the delib-
erate policy of government, the per-
sonalities of Ministers, and the at-
mosphere of clubs.
Nothing in the article suggests there
is anything for an Opposition to do, and
the absence of an “Opposition” is
treated as the absence of a piece of
political furniture required if Singapore
is to keep up with the Joneses.
In w'hat country and in w'hat situa-
tion has it been suggested that Gov-
ernment should create an organised
Opposition where its critics, on their
own, cannot find persons or policy to
create an effective Opposition?
Mr. Bonavia gives praise so un-
stintingly to the PAP Government, the
quality of its leadership, and the effect-
iveness of its policies that it suggests
that he, as a Singapore citizen, would
not find reason to join an Opposition.
It cannot, nonetheless, be denied that
feelings of wariness, if not trepidation,
in relation to Goverment do exist,
though they are largely confined to the
English-educated intellectuals.
But Mr. Bonavia assumes that
because the feelings exist they must be
justified. This assumption of the right
of the intellectual, qua intellectual, not
only to be consulted, but to be accepted
as authoritative, and to be autonomous
in determining the extent to which the
urgencies of national survival, political
or economic, should impinge on their
w'ay of life, is a major factor in their
attitude to Government.
Decision on the use of power and
indecision in the search for truth are
considered as the respective political
spheres of power of Government and
intellectual; and from this distinction
arises a defensive attitude of non-
involvement, and a wish to co-operate
in nation-building without involvement
with the Government which is the
chosen instrument of nation-building.
Is there any communal or class group
which feels in Opposition and cannot
form an Opposition? As there was in
1954 when, in spite of the active hos-
tility of the then Colonial Govern-
ment of Singapore and its powerful
Special Branch, the PAP was formed
to reflect and remedy the frustration
of nationalists, Chinese-educated and
workers, against an unfree, unjust, and
unequal society. The PAP did not look
to the Special Branch, to the person-
ality of the Governor, or to the climate
of Tanglin Club as a justification for
self-liquidation, and they won through
to power by purely political and con-
stitutional means.
To suggest that there is the mono-
lithic monotony of a one-party State
with a one-track mind in Singapore is
unrealistic. The PAP back-benchers
have been more effective critics of their
own Government than ever the Barisan
Socialis have been since 1963.
And, above all, the Government
knows, and no one better, and tries
to inject their knowledge into the
mind of those whose attitude Mr. Bon-
avia reflects, that there is, underground
in the Red shadows, a group which
sees itself not as an alternative Govern-
ment but as the only legitimate al-
ternative Government, and which can
only be kept out of power by effective
Government.
The problem of Singapore is not
one of restraining the too much zeal
for nation-building among the few,
but of increasing the too little zeal
among the many.

Asian Communism
The second paragraph of Mr. Clark’s
letter (8., Feb. 25} contains two
"interesting” assertions. One is that
Communist insurgencies are caused by
excessively harsh and crude methods of
anti-Communist repression. This is fac-
tually false, and is merely a variant of
the tactical Leninist propaganda stunt
that Communist insurgencies are always
defensive. The second assertion is that
if Lim rather than Lee had come to
power the latter would have been
"forced” to side with Communist insur-
gents. There is not a shred of evidence
to support this and much evidence
against it. The fate of anti-Communist
social democrats such as Lee under
conditions of Communist control is very
well-known from ample precedents.
Their ruthless persecution in Vietnam
at the hands of the Indo-Chinese Com-
munists both before and after the break-
down of French colonial rule is, per-
haps, a good indication of what would
have happened to Lee if Mr. Clark’s
present political mates had had their
way in the ’fifties and if Malaya had
been handed over to the Communists.

The Melbourne See
Mr. Grant does well in trying to fos-
ter discussion (8., Feb. 25) on the
subject of Roman Catholic hierarchical
succession in Melbourne, but does he
really believe that no “suitable local
candidate for this appointment could
be found”? Let us rather discuss the
positive side of his letter.
In the Dogmatic Constitution on the
Church (par. 13), the Fathers had this
to say: “. . . each individual part of
the Church contributes through its
special gifts to the good of the other
parts and the whole Church. Thus
through the common sharing of gifts
and through the common effort to
attain the fullness of unity, the whole
and each of the parts receive increase.”
Further, paragraph 37 of the same
Decree declares: “An individual lay-
man, by reason of the knowledge, com-
petence, or outstanding ability which
he may enjoy, is permitted and some-
times even obliged to express his
opinions on things which concern the
good of the Church . . . Let them
(sacred pastors) willingly make use of
his (the layman’s) prudent advice . . .
(sacred pastors) for their part, aided
by the experience of the laity (the
parts mentioned in par. 13), can more
clearly and more suitably come to
decisions regarding spiritual and tem-
poral matters.”
Other sections of the documents
similarly deal with the free flow of
advice and experience between the lay-
man and his Bishop and vice versa. A
part of this dialogue must refer to
choice and succession of Bishops, and
our future elected lay Synod must be
able to offer advice and recommenda-
tions on such appointments. Then,
drawing on our own cultural heritage,
we will have no need for imports such
as Mr. Grant suggests.
TIMOTHY CARTER
Lane .Cove (N.S.W.)
Peace?
In the light of THE BULLETIN’S
position on Vietnam, the statement in
your editorial of February 25 that:
“It is in Hanoi not in Peking or
Moscow . . . that the final decision to
cool down the war will be made” fairly
leapt at the eye.
Such a belief implies that you recognise
that we have taken up arms not against
China or Russia but against the North
Vietnamese. What threat they pose to
the security of the United States and
its allies and in particular of Australia
and New Zealand is hard to imagine.
Our support of a puppet government
headed by renegades from the other
side and our participation in the sys-
tematic destruction of the country and
its people with all the marvels of our
principal ally’s technology evokes
memories of France, Norway, Poland,
and the Ukraine of the early ’forties.
Adolph come back, all is forgiven!

Colombo Plan Aid
Professor Tregonning argued (8., Feb.
4) that unless a graduate of an Aus-
tralian university were willing to
actively remedy the deficiencies in-
herent in the biased nature of his train-
ing he would be unsuitable for service
in his own country.
This, of course, is applicable to
limited cases only. In medicine and
agriculture his point is especially per-
tinent. There is a scattering of subjects
with varying degrees of relevance or
irrelevance, each requiring its own
amount of “correction.”
From my own experience I realise
that the professional education em-
phasised by Prof. Tregonning was a
very important part of the Colombo
Plan Scholarship. But this was not the
exclusive aim. The environment and the
extra-mural activities presented by
Australian universities, and the country
as a whole during , long holidays, are
invaluable for the new light they throw
on the more familiar things at home.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
The Present
Holdings
Scrutinised
AFTER THE SHAKE-OUT last week
I was hoping that the market would
be placed on a more even keel. My
hopes were in vain. More, probably, on
a falling market than on any other
market, one has to continually scrutinise
the portfolio. Consequently, it seems
timely to look at my own portfolio in
some detail.
Starting at the top, Gold Mines of
Kalgoorlie is a somewhat dismal intro-
duction. I didn’t have time to gather
breath last month when the shares sud-
denly dropped 20 cents. Always in-
fluenced by devaluation rumors, I’ll
bide my time at this point. Eglo also
has been disappointing. Yet the pros-
pect of a good interim report and a
further increase in profits stops me
from selling this stock.
Buckinghams was one of the few
stocks to move against the market last
week. Although only a 2 cent rise, this
represents a 15 percent increase in the
value of investment. On this subject of
percentage rises, an even more signifi-
cant move was the rise of 1 cent in
the Amalgamated Petroleum 41 cent
paid shares. Who can resist a 20 percent
rise in the market? I earned 15 dollars
on the sale of these shares at 6 cents.
Unlike Buckinghams, Coles does reflect
the present tone of the market. A better
market should see an increase in the
share price.
The interim report of Fire Fighting
was not over-exciting. Probably worth
more than par in the medium term, I’ll
settle for 51 cents this week. Hanimex
had my seal of approval attached to it
last week. Likewise, Waugh and Joseph-
son still looks a good prospect.
A few mining stocks in the portfolio
reflect the reappraisal of that side of
the market. Kathleen seems to have lost
its glitter, but could come again on any
announcement about its uranium leases.
Although the wolfram price shows no
sign of faltering, the same could not be
said about King Island Scheelite shares;
however, I’m not greatly concerned
about its price fall.
I’m quite happy about the heavy-
weights in the portfolio Pioneer
Concrete, Tooheys, and Dunlop. This
last mentioned has been getting favor-
able treatment from the giant (or
should I say knight) of all brokers.
My views on oil shares have been
fairly fully expressed over the past
month or so. Thus the explanation for
three of them in the portfolio.
The latest addition to the portfolio
was Rothmans. Bought at $1.82, I was
hoping for a quick profit at a price a
little above $2. This target proved too
high and I ended up selling them at
$1.95. A profit'of $ll is better than
nothing. So much for the past.
As for the present, I’m looking at
Bali Plantations to provide a lift to the
portfolio. This is more a case of invest-
ing in two commodities rather than the
share itself. Cocoa and, more recently,
copra have risen in price, a contrast to
most other commodities. Cocoa is up
about 70 percent from the price a year
ago, while a $5 increase in the copra
price has just been announced. Even on
its past financial record, Bali Planta-
tions deserves more than a casual
glance. Dividend rate was raised from
8 percent in 1962 to 10 percent in
1964, and has remained at this level in
the past two years. Thus, at 51 cents,
the stock also scores on the income
aspect.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
4000 Amal. Pet. 41c pd. 6 $llB.
200 Rothmans 1.95 $382.
500 Fire Fighting 51 $249.
BOUGHT

Hi
s.
colour me black
Some people think black is for the birds.
But if we thought about it that way, your tyres might
be more expensive, or less reliable.
You see, we make carbon black. And right now we’re
introducing our E.P.F. to the trade. To manufacturers
that means Easy Processing Furnace —to you it can
mean better and more economical rubber products.
So to us, black is anything but a dull subject. We’ve
done, and continue to do, some pretty exciting things
with it. Long ago we added an enthusiasm that hasn’t
let us be content just to make quality carbon black.
We’ve researched product improvements, developed
new products. And 80% of our laboratory staff engaged
on quality assessment have been with us since our
beginnings seven years ago. That’s experience.
Result? Continuing technical advances that will let
rubber compounders’ imagination take flight—always
at a benefit to the customer.
So say bye-bye blackbird, and, next time you think
of black, will you think of us?

i*ER & SONS, LTD.
When you pour yourself a Johnnie
Walker you have more than 40
‘single’ whiskies all in one glass
because it does take that many fine
whiskies to make one Johnnie
Walker. That’s the secret of
Johnnie Walker’s smoothness and
mellowness. And 146 years’ skill in
blending. These different whiskies
come from all over Scotland. Rich,
characterful Glenlivets and
Highland malt whiskies tangy
with the faint taste of smoke from
peat fires. Smooth, rounded Islays.
And clean, fresh-tasting grain
whiskies from the Lowlands. Some
of these whiskies are matured as
long as fifteen years none less
than five. All very smooth. Very
mellow. No wonder Johnnie Walker
is the world’s best-loved Scotch. In
miniatures, 5 oz. and 13 oz. flasks,
13 oz. and 26 oz., square bottles.
