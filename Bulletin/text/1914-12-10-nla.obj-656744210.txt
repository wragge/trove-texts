Hudson's Eumenthol TootH Powder
SECURES SOUND WHITE TEETH AND A HEALTHY MOUTH.
Some practical reasons why Hudson’s Eumenthol Tooth Powder
should be used for Cleansing and Preserving the Teeth.
BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues
that have made Eumenthol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but
cleanses mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the teeth so wonder-
fully, and wards off decay as no other preparation for the teeth
can do, or will do, without affecting the Tooth Enamel.
BECAUSE the Committee of the British Dental Association
recommends Powder in preference to Pastes* Liquids or Soaps for
cleasing and preseiving the teeth.

Pearls and it!locks 1 Livers
Among the jetsam thrown up on Austra-
lian beaches from English publishers of
we may, here and there, find treasure,
(Mostly, however, as Sydney surfers find, it
is bullock’s liver, deposited by Corporation
punts just outside the tbrpe-mile limit.
Many puntloads of bullock’s entrails are
wafted to us from the English publishers of
poetic garbage.) The pearls that the sea
has are often flawed, yet worth keeping.
Rose Macaulay, author of The Two Blind
Countries (Sidgwick and Jackson) does not
fling us bullocks’ livers: she proffers us
pearls. She manages by the cunning use of
common words to convey a dim impression
of indubitable poetry. Yet, strangely
enough, her work is marred by a lack of
melody, a crudeness of form that discord-
antly jars. Consider “The Thief ”:
When the paths of dream were mist-muffled,
And the hours wereS dim and small
(Through still nights on wet orchard grass
Like rain the apples fall),
Then naked-footed, secretly,
The thief dropped over the wall.
Apple-boughs spattered mist at him.
The dawn was as cold as death,
With a stealthy joy 'at the heart of it,
And the stir of a small sweet breath,
And a robin breaking his heart on song
As a young child sorroweth.
The thief’s feet bruised wet lavender
Into sweet, sharp surprise ;
The orchard, full of pears and joy,
Smiled like a gold sunrise ;
But the blind house stared down on him
With strange, white-lidded eyes.
He stood at the world’s secret heart
In the haze-wrapt mystery ;
And fat pears, mellow on the lip,
He supped like a honey-bee ;
But the apples he crunched with sharp white
teeth
Were pungent, like the sea.
Arid this was the oldest garden joy,
Living and young and sweet.
And the melting mists took radiance,
And the silence a rhythmic beat,
For the day came stealing stealthily,
A thief, upon furtive feet.
And the walls that ring this world about
Quivered like gossamer,
Till he heard, in the other worlds beyond,
The other peoples stir,
And met strange, sudden, shifting eyes
Through the filmy barrier.
—Rose Macaulay.
Her book contains half a dozen poems of
this eerie kind : the rest are but blurred echoes
of that linlf-dozen. Yet room must be made
for her tramp :
He had a beard like a dandelion,
And I had none ; -
He had tea in a beer-bottle,
Warm with the sun;
He had pie in a paper bag,
Not yet begun....
Most of T. Sturge Moore’s verses in The
Sea is Kind (RieEards) are bullocks’ livers,
classical corpse-verses, coldly and correctly
laid out. From this big book but two things
have life in them, a pretty conceit of inno-
cent happiness and a tragic picture re-
painted. Here is his “Chorus of Greek
Girls.”
We maidens are older than most sheep,
Though not so old as the rose-bush is ;
AVe are only as pretty as that.
We are gay as the weather, our minds are deep
Like wells, as any boy tells
By the blushes he dares not kiss.
The hills are fond of our chat.
AVe dance and shake ,like ringing bells, . V'-;
Till our hair tumbles out of our hoods.
The boys are away in the woods
Hunting the boar or the bear.
But joy is here- as well as there;
Pretend to fly
Up into the sky,
Jumping with both feet together—
Holding out like wings
Your sleeves and things.
Feeling as light as a feather,
We don’t wonder whether
The day is long
Or the night short,
Since all our thought
—Big as the song
Of a brown, fussy bee—-
But just fills the flower which we
Each call “Me.”
Horace Holley, author of Creation; Post-
Impressionist Poems (Fifield) has poetry
within him, when he is not deliberately try-
ing to be post-impressionistic. He can paint
a picture, as this of “The Dreamer” :
God the Father in His easy chair, pondering the great
book of Vision,
Lets fall a casual hand the while He broods tremend-
ously the word ;
And on his little stool beside the human child, rest-
less for play,
Takes the slack fingers in his busy -grasp,
Fondles them, tracing the great, grave, philosophic
lines and wrinkles,
And rubs his cheek against the palm, kissing it all
over with a sudden fondness ;
But fallen from his little stool, and crying aloud,
Pulls at the casual Hand and whimpers for a word, a
glance,
All in vain, now and for ever :
For God the Father is quite lost in the terrible endless
A r ision, „
And from the height whereon He broods sunk in His
easy chair,
Only the casual Hand falls down, the slack, forgetful
fingers,
Tear-wet or kissed, gently relax, nor close the Book,
nor lift the child.
And he can cunningly embody an impres-
sion—this, of “The Blue Girl”
She does not walk, like me;
She swims, an undulation, a perfumed water, chang-
ing, changing.
When she is gone I try to think of her,
But dream and all desire turn inward, empty—
Her passing burns no steadfast line upon my vision
To recreate her beauty from,
Beauty, like life itself, lost in its own rhythm.
Perfume and water.
Others I could dream of, and loved my dream far
more than woman.
She alone I must havg, the beautiful,
Like perfumed water, flowing, flowing.
Max Weber’s Cubist Poems (Elkin Mat-
thews) are ruthlessly gyroscopic. His first
poem begins with this exciting line: —
Cubes, cubes, cubes, cubes,
which sounds easy. He has poems upon his
kitchen, on his Chinese teapot, on dead birds
and on Buddhas. Here and there- some
poetry escapes from his cubes. In "Haze”
he actually captures and reveals an elusive
mood. One example will sumce: it is en-
titled “I Wonder” :—-
Many men, many women,
Young and old people.
1 sat with them gazing'.
With them 1 laughed at the picture-story.
Now the St. Mark’s in Venice, and gondolas,
Now scenes of industry in Arabia,
A picture story ended.
Many sat, men and women gazed
And laughed, and now absorbed.
A tragedy ; feats of bravery,
And now the life- of the Belle-terra
Another story ended.
Naive orchestral strains
And she passed out.
I sat, I watched, I laughed
As all did laugh and watch the story,
Though no more was-1 alone.
She was with me,
She whom I never had seen,
But the one glance of her was a breath of Paradise.
She whom l never had known,
She who had gone three stories since.
She of a multitude who then passed out.
She had left me a vision and perfume of love.
But one glimpse of her I had,
And saw the sun shine an eternity.
And my yearn for her,
Now my yearn is pain.
Who is she?
Where is she ?
Why can’t she be mine?
If she but knew, 1 wonder —-
If she but felt, would she have come to me?
Another story ended.
A new tune played,
The people come and go,
She had long since gone,
And I see her passing out ,
Another flower of love I smell.
The memory of her face and form I kiss. ,
Where is she now ?
Will she ever return?
Who is she ?
My yearn is greater
And my heart aches....
There’s a lot more yearn and a lot more
wonder and a lot more mis-punctuatibn ; but
this will do for Max Weber. He gets his
effect, but surely he could have achieved his
effect more artistically, and with more
economy? The fault of these cubist poems
is that they are not mathematically cubic.
Their shape is too wilfully irregular. .. .
something of the shape of bullocks’ livers.
The Futility of Progress
Guglielmo Ferrero, the historian of The
Greatness and Decline of Rome, is struck
with the parallel between the United States
and ancient Rome. “For what we, men of
the 20th century, call ancient civilisations,
were really, when they flourished, new and
young civilisations, with but few centuries
of history behind them; and so are the
American civilisations of the present day.
For this reason, we find in ancient civilisa-
tions, on however much reduced a scale,
many phenomena which are now peculiar to
American social systems; while we should
look for them in vain in European civilisa-
tion, which has more right to call itself
ancient civilisation than have the civilisa-
tions! of Greece and of Rome.” Heiice his
volume, Ancient Rome and Modern
America, a comparative study of morals and
manners (Putnam, per Dymock’s Library).
Ferrero allows his theory sometimes over-
much to sway his interpretation of modern
conditions ; but the point of view of an his-
torian of ancient civilisations confronted by
the blatant fact of America gives rise to
some interesting suggestions. Thus he finds
for the long reign of Diaz in Mexico the,
same reason as there was for the dictator-
ship of Augustus in Rome: each dictator
seemed alone capable of ensuring a wise
government and of preventing civil wars.
But there is always this great difference
between the ancient and the modern civilisa-
tions; our civilisation is a mechanical-
scientific civilisation, while the ancient civil-
isation was above all things an artistic
civilisation. The ancients did not invent
the steam engine, because they did not
want steam engines. In fact, “they ab-
stained from inventing and constructing
machines, not from lack of knowledge but
from lack of will. The effort seemed to
them useless, nay, pernicious.” Why? Be-
cause they desired quality, not quantity.
J*
“Consuming little, and content with a life
of simplicity and poverty, the ancients had
no need to produce much or to produce at
great speed. So they had no requirement
for machines. The few simple machines,
which the hand of man or the muscular force
of domestic animals can operate, sufficed.
They had no need of science to help them
to construct new machines of greater size
and power. They had no need to work at
high pressure. They could work slowly,
with their hands and with few simple
instruments, and with them produce beauti-
accurate arid finished articles, which
aspired to a lofty and difficult ideal of per-
fection. Accordingly art occupied in the
ancient world the position which science
occupies in modern civilisation. It was not
a refined luxury for the few, but an ele-
mentary and universal necessity. Govern-
ments and wealthy citizens were obliged to
adorn their cities with monuments, sculp-
tures and pictures, to embellish squares,
streets and houses, because the masses wished
the cities to be beautiful, and would have
rebelled against an authority which would
have them live in an unadorned city; just
as nowadays they would rebel against a
municipal authority which would have them
dwell in a city without light.... If the
quantity-ox u,e tilings produced by the indus-
try of the ancients was small their quality
was refined and excellent. The contrary is
the case in the modern world. The euantity
of the things which modern industry, thanks
to electricity- and steam-driven machinery,
produces is prodigious. No century ever
witnessed the realisation of the miracle of
abundance in a more marvellous way. But
the ugliness and the crude vulgarity of so
many objects are the price we pay for the
abundance of our times.” We go in for
quantity, not quality—and naturally we have
to pay the price—in ugliness. “We cannot
have a great deal in this world, and have
that great deal beautiful.”
This contrast is seen even in literature.
“How little the ancients wrote and read com-
pared with ourselves! The press did not
exist ; paper, now the cheapest of materials,
was a rare luxury. . . .Consequently, the
number of persons who could provide them-
selves with books was very small, and such
persons were found only among the elite of
culture or of wealth. The only oppor-
tunities of reading the people had were
afforded by the public notices, and by the
laws engraved on bronze or marble tablets.”
And even the few who wrote could not
write much. Conciseness and brevity were
the two necessary qualities in times when
paper was dear, and every copy of a book
had to be prepared specially by an amanu-
ensis. It was, therefore, the circumstance
that the ancients wrote so little that enabled
them to write so well.
J*
From his survey of the two Americas Fer-
rero believes that the decadence of the
Roman Empire is beginning in our modern
world. His well-known theory is that the
disease that killed the Roman Empire was
excessive urbanisation. “Neither the at-
tacks of barbarism from outside nor those
.of Christianity from within would have pre-
vailed against its might and its massive
weight, if the strength of the colossus had
not been already undermined by this internal
cancer.” And this is the cancer that is
found eve'nvhere in the world to-day, and
chiefly in Australia.
The first'serious, universally felt symp-
tom of this excessive urbanisation is the rise
in the cost of living. “The cities grow bigger;
industries increase in number and in Size.;'the r
luxury arid the needs of the masses, crowded
together in the cities, augment. On the other
hand ? there is no proportionate increase in
the productiveness of the land. And so the
increase in wealth is accompanied bv an in-
creasing scarcity of the fruits of the earth ;
and the things which serve to clothe and feed
us—cotton, linen, hemp, wool, cereals, meat,
vegetables—nearly all rise in price much
more than do manufactured goods. This ex-
plains the scarcity that vexes the cities in
proportion to their growth in size.” Ferrero
finds this phenomenon most apparent in those
countries that show the largest disproportion
between, the progress of the country and that
of the cities', between industrial progress and
agricultural progress. He instances the
United States ; he might even more emphati-
cally have instanced the Commonwealth.
Yet this grave evil breeds its own cure. The
cost of living in cities has only to rise suffi-
ciently high to render living in cities unbear-
able to a sufficient number of their citizens
to drive those citizens back to the land. The
Roman Empire fell because Rome and the
great cities refused to take the necessary
steps to bring about a natural equilibrium.
By mearis of great public works and free
distributions of food, Rome made life arti-
ficially easier for its citizens —-at the cost of
increasing the taxes on agriculture. The col-
lapse. of the Empire was thus inevitable.
This is the mistake that modern civilisation
must learn to avoid. This is the lesson that
Ferrero finds in the 'smash-Up of the Roman
Empire. The rise in the cost of living “is a
salutary and beneficent visitation. For it
puts a natural brake on the growth of cities
and their luxury, and keeps the population in
the fields, where the rise in the price of
living brings profit, greater comfort and im-
proved living in its train.” All artificial
measures which pretend to mitigate this evil
must therefore be pernicious.
J*
The question whether we are better people
than the ancients affords Ferrero opportunity
for some ingenious speculation. He finds
that we are braver than the ancients. Our
control of fire, formidable machines, elec-
tricity, explosives, etc., our exploits in the
air, on the sea, in mines, have steeled our
temperaments to quell our heritage of blind
and instinctive fear. War is the supreme
test of courage ; and modern war, as we too
well know, is infinitely more terrible and
awe-inspiring than the war of the ancients.
The men who fought at Marathon had no
need to be as courageous as the men who are
fighting now in Europe. And, since we are
less cruel than the ancients, our superior
courage is thrown into greater relief. But if
we are more courageous and more humane,
we are in no way more sober or more tem-
perate. “As far as these virtues are con-
cerned the ancient world cuts a much better
figure in history than does the modern. The
motlern world eats and drinks to excess....
The only intoxicating drinks known to the
ancients were wine and beer, the wine they
always drank mixed with water. They did
not know alcohol ; they did not know , tea,
coffee or tobacco. We can assert positively
that drunkenness was the rarest of vices in
the ancient world, while frugality was the
commonest of virtues.”
The reader will find, in this stimulating
work, occasion for thought in Ferrero’s theory
that machinery produces only apparent
wealth, not real wealth; that a machine-
civilisation, such as characterises the. modern
world, results only in the increase in man-
kind’s needs without the possibility of fully
satisfying them; that it is, in short, this
modern ideal of progress that is responsible
for the wide-spread discontent with life. The
theory is carefully argued, but at, too great
length for exposition here.
The War
Germany and England, by J. A. Cramb,
professor of Modern History', London (Mur-
ray ; 35.), consists of the incomplete text of
a series of lectures delivered by the author,
whose death in October, 1913, precluded-
their revision. Gramb's theory is that “the
forces which determine the actions of empires
and great nations are deep hidden and not
easily affected by words or even by feelings
of hostility or friendship. They lie beyond
the wishes or intentions of the individuals
composing those nations.” Hence the pre-
sent conflict could no more have been pre-
vented than a volcano could have been
plugged. The fault of the English has been
their complacent ignorance of German litera-
ture, especially England’s colossal indiffer-
ence to German history and German politics,
Not a' page of Treitsclike’s greatest work has
been translated —and Treitschke is the voice
of the modern German soul. Bernhardi’s
book is derived directly from Treitschke. Its
distinction is that it represents a definite
attempt to understand not only how Ger-
many could make war on England, but why
Germany ought to initiate that war. Eng-
land is the only enemy. Her mere existence
as. the British Empire is sufficient provoca-
tion to the Iluns. According to the Trussing
School of History England is the great robber
State. She exists still, but her sceptre is
falling from her nerveless handsGerlnany
is ready to snatch it from her. .Who else
could be the inheritor of this moribund
empire?
Cramb has no patience with the pacifists—
his book was published last June. A careful
examination discovers, for him something in
war that escapes the tenets of pacificism.
The persistence of war in spite of what seems
its uifreason—-“this extraordinary paradox in
human history”—shows that there is in war
something that transce'nds reason; “that in
war and the right of war man has a possession
which he values above religion, above indus-
try and above social comforts.” And he finds
in all the wars waged by England from the
14th century there has been, one governing
idea, the idea of Empire. “....Here, then,
we have this transcendental force governing
the wars of England. And if we turn from
England to Germany we find the same ele-
ment which transcends reason governing the
wars of Germany.”
And the source of that German Imperial-
ism was Heinrich von Treitschke. He has
incessantly pointed his nation onwards to a
war with England, to the destruction of Eng-
land. And his influence has gone on steadily
increasing until the present day. It is curi-
ous to learn that, like Nietsche, Treitschke
was Slavonic in origin. His ancestors were
Czechs; While yet a boy an illness left him
incurably stone deaf. His fate forced him to
become a writer instead of a soldier. His
fame as a lecturer was the greatest in the
history of Germany. He preached the great-
ness o_f Prussia, the glory of an army which is
a nation, and of a nation which is an army.
His conviction was that the greatness of
England, social, political, intellectual and
moral, was a sham. Her Empire had been
built up “by the hazard of her geographical
situation, the supineness of other nations, the
measureless duplicity of her Ministers, and
the natural and innate hypocrisy of the
nation as a whole.” But the triumph of the
German world-dominion, established by brute
force, will not be merely a material dominion.
It will be a triumph of “German culture” ;■
and, according to the Germans, this implies
“truth instead of falsehood, German sincerity
instead of British hypocrisy.” Well, we know
now the meaning of German truth, German
sincerity, German culture!
This book is an unbiassed and authorita-
tive examination of the unseen driving forces
that have brought about this world-catas :
trophe.

somely produced by Constable at 6s. a

that they come in every conceivable useful

AFTER filling the magazine and throw-
ing a cartridge into the chamber of
this rifle all that it is necessary to do to
shoot it ten times is to pull the trigger for each
shot. Being loaded by the recoil it is very easy to

the joy of life. On others you feel just as dull.
When these depressing feelings are upon you, you
don’t want to eat, you don’t Want to work, you
don’t want to do anything ! The truth of the
matter is, you have a touch of biliousness, or in
other words, your liver is out of order and digestion
disturbed. On such occasions, it is not really a
case for the doctor, it is merely a case for one or two
Cockle’s Pills

that their fame soon spread all over the world. If this is one of
your “ don’t-want-to ” days, get a box of Cockle’s Pills at once;
take two to night and to-morrow
you will feel like a new man.

in England in 1840 and many of the letters on

to see if the results were permanent before writing you, and
I now wish to sav that I think the treatment is absolutely
marvellous. Before adopting it I was only skin and bones,
but now I am one of the best walking advertisements you
could have. It did all you claimed for it and really more,
and the results were startlingly ahead of my fondest expec-

satisfactorily, and I now thank you for urging me to have
the treatment.”

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Soldier Libertine.
[The author has followed the popular pronuncia-
tion of Libertine.]
Oh, he was very handsome
When he went to the war—
Ilis eyes would haunt an angel—
They’ll haunt the pure no more,
lie’s sleeping out to-night beside
The old road to the Rhine,
From me who should have been his bride,
My Soldier Libertine.
1 hope they shot the brute before
lie looked in French girls’ eyes
I like to think that he went pure
From me to Paradise ;
Or to the Hell he strove to win
Through women, lies and wine.
And all the girls he led to sin
My Soldier Libertine.
I hope a bullet set him free
From all his lofty pride,
And he had time to think of me
In pain before he died ;
I hope they did not mangle him—•
He was so tall and fine—
I never saw his eyes grow dim —
My Soldier Libertine.
And he hath left a son behind
Beneath the Southern skies,
Perhaps to grow with Satan’s mind
And angel-haunting eyes.
And he hath left a bonny girl,
His bonny girl and mine,
Perchance to fall as once 1 fell,
My Soldier Libertine.
His heart was lik<| to Satan’s
Before he went to war;
His eyes would haunt an angel—
They’ll haunt the good no more.
He’s sleeping far away beside
The old road to the Rhine,
Who ne’er kept faith with any bride —
My Soldier Libertine.

HENRY LAWSON.
The Dead City.
Here was Her city; and I walked Her
street,
Seeing its sights, nor man nor woman seeing,
But hearing pass the catlike pad of feet,
With never glimpse of cat nor human being,
Nor movement in the shops, nor serving folk,
Nor wares that living people buy and sell.
“Some crazy god, in whimsy, plays a joke,
And I, as chosen victim of his spell,
While yet alive, am doomed to traverse Hell.”
Such was my musing. Then, lest I be dead,
I felt my heart. It throbbed with hollow
rumor.
I pinched my flesh. It whitened and flushed
red.
I tried to laugh, accordant with my humor.
But no laugh came, or just a woeful noise
As if a dead man sang a comic song,
A sound that giants make to dreaming boys
Before they spit and roast them. Wliat was
wrong ?
I felt my lips, I pulled them open wide,
Only to bare the chattering teeth inside.
And yet I was not frightened. If I were
A live man dead or else a dead man living
[Seeing Her face the while), I did not care;
Where hope was none how could there be mis-
giving? .
And so again I walked the street. Again
The squad of velvet footfalls padded by,
Till sullen Night came down like some dull
pain,
Some ache too rooted deep to meed a sigh.
Night settled on this city, where the Past
Had made a deed of dreams too rich to last.
And as I walked the city street, it seemed
The sounds beside me took on spectral form —-
The form of things that men in madness
schemed,
And steeled their hearts to compass. Like a
swarm
Of filthy mutes, they nightmared at my side,
With ciutchless fingers clutching at my heart,
And from their eyes, like fishes’ eyeballs, tried
To urge me to their service in the mart,
To shopkeep for their glory and restore
The worship they had known but knew no
more.
I understood it all. A rush of life
Swept through my veins and set my heart on
fire.
The city, sick of petty merchant strife,
Had found the measure of its mean desire.
The worthless toiling and the fruitless end,
It had at last proved these and proved them
vain,
“The worst being now, can any worse por-
tend?”
It asked itself, and then, without a pain,
It heaved one last and unrelenting breath,
Giving what soul remained of it to Death.
And I. remembering many bitter things,
Remembering life that made a mock of loving,
With surging hate too deep for utterings,
Too large to spill its store in sick reproving,
I fled that city as a man distraught,
Nor stayed my flight nor ever looked behind ;
The future, liowsoe’er with perils fraught,
Would drive, I hoped, this city out of mind,
And give me healing But, in epitaph,
Across the city cracked a dead girl's laugh.
MAORILAND.
BERNARD INGLEBY.
How Annoying!
The nature poet, all forlorn,
Must sit inside and lo! the morn
To pay a man of bulk and brawn
To push around and mow the law-n.
The idle man of bulk and brawn
Would much prefer to lo! the morn;
The nature poet, all forlorn,
Would count it joy to mow the lawn.
’Twixt 10-ing morns and mowing lawns
The world is full of groans and yawns;
But joy and sweet content would fill it
Did we but have the other’s billet.

The action of the lather on the beard is to
remove the oily covering on each hair. Then
the water can get at the hair to soften it.
So the one logical place to mix the lather is on
the face, where every motion of the brush not
only works the lather up but works it in. This
Colgate Way —without the cup —makes unnecessary
the “ mussy ” rubbing-in with the fingers.

MADE IN GERMANY.
In days which are now fortunately dead, and
which might be a great deal deader without
doing the race any injury, the doctor used to
divide a disease into sections. Thus, when
he got hold of a consumptive girl, he gave her
one bottle of medicine for the cough; one for
weakness; one for the habit of perspiring at
night; one for depression of spirits; one for
cold feet;'one for the hectic flush; one for
expectoration ; and one for the pain in the
stomach region. In fact, the faint but
well-filled patieiff' ' had a bottle for
everything except the consumption itself.
Somewhat reminiscent of this sort of medi-
cine-man is the Freetrader who attempts,
without doing violence to his own theories,
to find out why Australia can’t get along
under the present tariff save by perpetual
borrowing. The Sydney Telegraph is
strong on this line of inquiry, and on Decem-
ber 2 it published a brief article as follows :
“MADE IN GERMANY.”
In to-day’s issue*we begin the publication of a
series of articles on German and Austrian trade
with New South Wales, the result of a careful and
comprehensive inquiry. The object of the inquiry
has been to discover what we buy from the enemy
countries, and what chance there is of our taking
advantage of the war and the consequent temporary
cessation of these imports to establish the corres-
ponding industries among ourselves. The articles
which we publish to-day examine the general posi-
tion ; they will be followed by other instalments
dealing in turn with each particular branch of indus-
try—the iron trade, wool and clothing, chemicals,
building materials, etc. Taken together they will
provide in a readable and accessible form the infor-
mation needed to understand a subject which is,
perhaps, more talked about than studied, but which,
more than most subjects, can only be usefully dis-
cussed in the light of facts and figures. Those
facts and figures we have made it our business to
collect, and to collect impartially, without allowing
any fiscal theories to affect the inquiry. As is the
case in all really impartial investigations the facts
collected will supply arguments for all sides. Both
the Protectionist and the Freetrader will find wel-
come material in to-day’s instalment, and in those
which will follow. Our own interpretation we shall
reserve until we have placed all the facts before our
readers.
Then it set out on its inquiry by showing
how many wells, and post-holes, and door-
ways. and rabbit-burrows, and round
orifices for putting in the middle of
cannon, and how many thousand back-
yards, and blank spaces for setting round
the leader page of the Telegraph we import
from Germany, and why we do it, and how
we can or can’t avoid doing it with _or
without upsetting the Telegraph’s theories,
as represented by the newly-imported
editor, David D. Braham.
* * * *
It is hereby suggested that the whole
energy of the community should be centred
on the big question, and not on the symptoms
or the side issues. Australia has nominally
borrowed some £300,000,000 from Britain,
yet it hasn’t received one penny in coin from
Britain. All it has received is goods, and
it bought them with its lOU because they
were cheap-labor goods. Its existence for
at least 40 years has been a struggle to
enjoy -Bs. or 10s. or 12s. per day wages, and
yet to get goods made at 4s. per day rates.
In the process it has so starved its people
of employment that it has only a fraction of
the population it ought t« have. It has
pawned posterity for a thousand years ahead
in order that one loafing generation might
live easily, and boast that this is a great
country, and shirk the problem of
showing how the worker may be made com-
fortable and contented by his own efforts.
Within the first 10 months of the present
year the Commonwealth imported £9,000,000
worth more than it exported. The
difference was provided for by foreign
loans. And all the interest on public
and private foreign debts (something
like £14,000,000) was also provided for
out of foreign loans. That is to
say, : the country pawned its children and
their happiness and their hopes and their
prospects and their posterity and their souls
at the rate of £2,300,000 per month, in order
that it might wear American boots, and
drink German liquors.
* * * *
The wise men (or pessimists) who say
that the foreign loan policy must lead to
disaster are always met with the plain and
simple reply that it hasn't led to disaster.
The statement is perfectly true. During
the first 10 months of this year, as already
mentioned, Australia had the luck to borrow
enough abroad to cover all the interest on
its foreign debts and give it, in addition,
£9,000,000 worth of imported goods with
which to go on a burst. Therefore it had
a great time, and said that its policy had no
flies thereon. In fact, the borrowing country
had a much bigger “jag” than the lending
country. If the thriftless land could always
keep on borrowing enough to pay the interest
and something over, until the annual lOU
runs to £900,000,000 or so, then the loan
policy would be vindicated for several gen-
erations. But no one can guarantee—no
one can even hope—that the policy will
last. If the_British loans give out on Janu-
ary T, 1915, the chances are that by
December 31, 1916, wages will be down to
ss. a day, and many optimistic politicians
will be looking for a crust in a dust-bin.

There is no opportunity for years of intri-
cate controversy in _ Braitam’s Sydney
Telegraph about the importation of broad-
brimmed . boots from Baden, or about the
balance of trade in the matter of shoe-horns
and verandahs. and dog-kennels from
Schleswig-Holstein. The essential point
is that, unless imports are reduced
by about £25,000,000 per annum the
Commonwealth must continue to slither
down the road to perdition. Should
it happen, by reason of the war, that Bri-
tain can’t lend us any more money, perdi-
tion may come sometime next year, and the
banks may burst, and the mercantile houses
close up, and the high-born dames of Dar-
ling Point go out to domestic service. This
might not seriously affect Editor Braiiam,.
of Sydney Telegraph, who could presum-
ably go back to his old job in London, and is
consequently able to take a dispassionate
and philosophic view of things, but it would
be rough on the high-born dames of
Darling Point. If, by doubling or
trebling the tariff, a stop could be nut to
the ruinous drain of money to pay for im-
ports, and the ruinous flotation of foreign
loans to pay for imports and for the interest
on previous loans and imports, then there
would be time to consider Braham’s learned
dissertations upon the details of the case.
Anomalies might be adjusted, and the dis-
crepancies inherent in the duties on tele-
graph poles from Siberia, and currants from
Greece, and synthetic bell-toppers from
Germany might be considered in an
atmosphere of calm. But while the
country is losing work and acquiring
foreign debt at the rate of £2,300,000
a month it is advisable to do some-
thing right now. Calm is “off.” When
the ship is sinking it is best to stop the leak
at once, and deliver the lecture on naval
architecture afterwards.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tommy in the Marble Halls.
It is an unfortunate circumstance that very
many people yearn to be kind to somebody at
some other person’s expense. This is the
beginning of the sermon. The text follows
in the shape of a political paragraph which
has wandered through all the Australian
papers
INDIAN EMIGRATION.
Vicekoy’s Statement.
The Premier has received, through the Secretary of
State, the papers relating to the support offered by
the princes and peoples of India in connection with
the war.
The Yxeeroy of India, in opening the proceedings
of the Legislative Council on September 9, made the
following statement, on the question of Indian emi-
gration to British Dominions ;
“I appeal to the Indian public to view this ques-
tion in no narrow light. India has her rights, but
so equally have the colonies and dominions. Should
it be decided to negotiate with the Colonial Govern-
ments I am confident that they, with their strong
Imperial instincts, will meeet us in no mean nor nig-
gardly spirit, providing that we on our side show
our readiness to meet them half-way. The fact that
in a few weeks’ time our splendid Indian soldiers
will be fighting side by side and shoulder to shoulder
with our colonial fellow-subjects against the common
enemy is a guarantee of fair and generous treatment
on both sides in a controversy of this nature.”
It was almost inevitable that the services
rendered by Indian troops in the present
war should be used as some sort of an argu-
ment in favor of the admission of colored
peoples and colored cheap labor into Aus-
tralia and other places. The craze for
colored cheap labor is incurable. Australia,
in proportion to its scanty population, is
doing as much as India—probably more
than India—for the Empire, and it doesn’t
ask, by way of return, for any special con-
cessions in India. (The white population
of India is being steadily Wiped out by
colored competition, yet tjhe white man
doesn’t complain.) Nor does Australia ask
that Japan shall relax its strenuous system
of exclusion because of the Brito-Jap
alliance. Still the uprising of the brown
immigration problein was bound to happen.
It is a pity that the Viceroy didn’t view the
problem from the other own end
—and recommend that his own class should
make sacrifices by way of setting an ex-
ample. In a country like Australia, where
every man and woman has a vote, it is im-
possible to admit the Indian without making
him. in every respect, the equal of the
white. Our people don’t know exactly how
this work is to be done without disaster,
and it desires enlightenment. If the Indian
Government will make the native in every
respect equal to the white intruder, so that
he will be eligible for the position of Gov-
ernor-General, or Commander-in-Chief, or
any other big job that is going, then Aus-
tralia may acquire a better idea of the in-
wardness of the arrangement. Supposing
John Bull will even stop Kipling from
sneering at the Eurasian in very bad verse
and a darned sight worse prose; or will
offer a Hindu a portfolio in the British
Ministry: or will give his own white
Tommy Atkins of England the free run of
the aristocracy’s marble halls as a
reward for his valor, and regard him
as an equal and a possible candidate for the
hand of Lady Clara Vere de Vere, the
situation will be more intelligible. Nobody
supposes for a moment that the boss Eng-
lishman will, because of the services done
by a handful of Indian troops in the war,
regard the gentleman of Hindostan as any
more qualified than he was before to com-
mand the local army or to control the local
Government. As for letting him blossom
forth in England, that is unthinkable.
There isn’t a word, and there won’t be a
word, about Ram Dass being any more
fitted than of olji to be Prime Minister in
succession to ASquitii. The daughter of
an Asiatic royal line which can trace its
pedigree back to times when the Guelphs
and the Cobtjhgs weren’t invented will be
no shred nearer to marriage with a Prince
of Wales after the war ends, even though
2.000,000 valiant Indian soldiers expend
their blood and their bones on the battle
line. It is difficult to see why “the
Dominions” should be asked to reconsider
their policy of keeping the community white
while the British policy of keeping the royal
family and all the big jobs of the Empire
white undergoes no reconsideration. The war
is a common burden, and all the Empire is
helping to carry it. Nobody has yet shown
why one part of the Empire or one class of
the Empire should specially reward another
part or class because they all humped the
load mutually. But if there is to be a special
reward it might he well to begin by lifting
Tommy Atkins to the level of his white
fellow-countryman who dwells in marble
halls, and by making him eligible for mar-
riage with Lady Clara Vere be Vere —
who would then become Mrs. Henry Smith.
Giving the People a Good Time.
The State Labor party in the N.S.W.
Legislature does no more to-day by way of
justifying its existence than it did yester-
day. It used to be an article of solid faith
among the Primitive Methodists of Corn-
wall (England—not Tasmania) that a good
man might with impunity commit more sin
than a bad man because “the Lord forgives
much to his elect.” After the same fashion
the N.S.W. Parliamentary crowd in office
appears to have convinced itself that it can
be more Tory than the Tories, also more
unjust, more /narrow, more unscrupulous
and more lop-sided—so long as it calls itself
“Labor.” The fact has often been men-
tioned that it has thrown overboard, with-
out shame or apology, almost every big
national item in its programme- —the re-
duction of borrowing, the sinking fund on
old loans, the application of new loans only
to works which will pay full interest and
sinking fund, the decentralisation, the solvent
finance, the abolition of the Upper House,
and the public ownership of land. The idea
of combining decentralisation and the public
ownership of land by the establishment of
State-owned cities at the Closed Ports, to
the possible detriment of the private land-
lords and trade monopolists of Sydney, fills
it with horror. Whatever influence it has
on tariff matters appears to be always
thrown in the scale on behalf of the
foreign cheap or “scab” or colored laborer
and the rich Tory importer, and against
Australian industry. It is an enthusiastic
patron of the Private Enterprise money-
lender, and it has a strange yearning to
even hand over the work of railway build-
ing to its irrepressible Private Enterprise
friends in England, Norton, Griffiths &
Co. It compulsorily forced down the price
of wheat, which must have been a blessing
to wheat-speculators who had contracted to
sell for future delivery at low prices and
found themselves faced with scarcity and
high prices. The constant pampering of
its friend Nielsen with an immense salary
for doing nothing in particular in America
has become a scandal. It is not much less
of a scandal tha.t the head of the Govern-
ment is now the unabashed supporter of
the Private Enterprise bookmaker as
against the Socialistic tote. It was the
same gentleman who, some years ago, airily
brushed aside the matter of a party supporter
who had done some very strange things
with the electoral roll; the case was defined
as “mis-directed enthusiasm,” or words to
that effect. Another member of the N.S.W.
Ministry—the Attorney-General—has re-
cently given way to excitement be-
cause Australia’s leading Labor paper drew
attention, in unguarded language, to the
fact that he refused to prosecute a political
friend or acquaintance on a serious charge.
The visible case against the political friend
or acquaintance consisted of evidence given
in open court at the preliminary hearing,
and the case for him consisted of evidence
submitted privately and not subjected to
public scrutiny. A strike, which is wholly
illegal according to the party’s own indus-
trial law, has been in progress for 26 weeks,
and a beaming Minister said the other day.
that “in not taking drastic action he
thought he was acting in the best interests
of the people.” As regards another case
in which fines had been imposed for an un-
lawful strike the same person stated cheer-
fully that “no steps had been taken to
enforce the penalties.” Unless the evidence
is all a sham and a fraud, one consistent
feature, and only one, sticks out in the
N.S.W. State Government’s policy—a
tendency to buy the support of enough
people to make the re-election sure, even- if
the support has to be bought by shameful
waste of loan money, by winking at influ-
ential monopolies, and by bearing lightly on
the law-breaker when he is numerous' and
liable to make political trouble. Tbej key
of the whole situation is loans, because when
wages are paid out of loans it isn’t neces-
sary to consider the value of the -work
done. The present crowd gets the votes
and Posterity faces the payment, and a
good-hearted Ministry can make the wages
any amount per day so long as the borrow-
ings last. “The way to keep in office,”
said a notable N.S.W. Labor politician
when the loan boom was starting, “is to
give the people a good time while you are
in office.” He said nothing about the pay-
ment of the bill for the good time.
Incidentally he was himself a Sydney
landlord.

The Unwise Policy of Waving the
Jemmy.
The verdict of history will probably be that
Germany’s passion for braggadocio put it
back for a century. France’s three-year
training system was hateful to a people
which loves to make and save money. The
nation would never have swallowed it had
German publicists and politicians been able
to gag themselves on the subject of “the
German Michael,” the “clenched fist,” and
so on. In the end France was literally
bragged into the formation of an army so
numerous and so efficient that it has been
able already to fight to a standstill the
Fatherland’s allegedly invincible troops.
The British Liberal Party is essentially a
Peace Party. The nation has to be, figura-
tively speaking, belted under the ear in a
public fashion before it will adopt the offen-
sive against anyone. Germany never gave
the pacificists a chance to be pacific. Its
melodramatic rot about “the Day,” and its
tireless assertions that the German navy
would wipe the British fleet off the ocean,
defeated all the efforts of the Little Navy-
ites in the House of Commons. The steady
volume of skite which flowed from Berlin
had the effect, ultimately, of creating a
Jingo junta in a party which had never in
its history known anything of the sort.
Britain still clings to the voluntary-service
system. When the War began the recruit-
ing sergeants badly needed the help of a
national stimulus. The blatant conceit of
Germany supplied it. The Kaiser’s refer-
ence to French’s “contemptible little army”
was the best of spurs. The impudence of
the phrase, applied by a warrior who had
never seen blood shed unless at manoeuvres,
to an army which had been up to its neck
in real warfare all over the world most of
its long and gory life, impressed the nation’s
sense of proportion; and Kitchener’s new
army swelled at an astonishing rate. At
the time of writing German envoys are
struggling to win the moral support of the
United States. It is not forthcoming in
quantities worth mentioning, though that
country teems with people who have no
affection for the British Empire. The chief
reasons for Germany’s failure in this cam-
paign are that it is the only European danger
to Monroeism, and that it has bellowed its
intentions and opinions in this connection in
the old, familiar way. Bernhardi and the
rest have so persistently vociferated their
contempt for the action of the U.S. in
“devoting their attention to money-making,
in order to save the 300,000,000 dollars
which they spend on their army and navy,”
that the Yankees are getting uneasy. A
cable of last week mentioned that the Pro*
The Reaper.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Who is this untiring toiler,
Reaping late and reaping early—
When the light of sunset reddens,
When the dawn is pale and pearly?
Sure, with such tremendous labor,
He should find his task a trial;
For his hours of ceaseless reaping
See the hands around the dial!
Tell me where his scythe was fashioned.
Tell me this; and tell me, prythee,
Where the blade was forged and tempered,
In what famed and ancient smithy?
Mark his arm-sweep ! Mark his shoulders !
As he reaps on hill and hollow,
Mark the gracious grain before him,
And the fallen swathes that follow!
Yet I think he reaps unseeing
(Either that, or most unkindly),
Since he spares not eared or earless,
And pursues the furrows blindly.
Is there then for him no leisure?
Must his arms be ever reaping?
Craves he not a while of resting?
Feels he not the need of sleeping?
Careless of the wind and weather,
Careless of the cannon’s rattle,
Nought can stay him, stay his
Hours of peace or hours of battle.
You war-makers, you world-masters,
Flashing far your shining sabres,
Are your bowels void of pity?
Is it well to load his labors?
All the Wide World is his harvest;
And, in spite of tears and sorrow,
Fields that he but reaped this noon-tide
He shall reap again to-morrow.
Broad the swathes that lie about him ;
Ancient is his task and endless ;
Yet ’tis said by some: “What folly!
He is friend unto .the friendless.”
Seek no further knowledge of him ;
Fill your round of life with laughter;
For who sees the Reaper’s visage
Looks through saddened eyes thereafter.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1914.
EXTRA AND SPECIAL ISSUE.
The Ordinary Issue of The Bulletin
will be published on the usual date.
fessor of Economic History in the Prince-
town University has predicted that no
matter which side wins the European wai,
the United States is certain to have trouble.
“America,” he says, “is sure to be confronted
with the abandonment of Monroeism or the
need of fighting to maintain it.” ±he U.b.
is not likely to increase its futile
army immediately, but it is bouna to do so
later on, and Germany will have its rooster-
like vanity to thank for it. _ The burglar
who makes a success of his job is the one
who is able to conceal his pride in his pro-
fession sufficiently to keep silent, at least
until the enterprise is finished. It is Ger-
many’s misfortune that it has been bragging
so deafeningly during the last 20 years, that
the world’s police know as much about its
plans as it does itself.
The Resumption of Shipbuilding.
Most people find it difficult to realise, in
this early and troubled hunk of the twen-
tieth century, that Australia was once a
shipbuilding country of no small importance.
There was a time when Hobart rivalled
Glasgow in ship construction, and when
great liners —as great liners went in those
days—were put together even at nlaces like
Twofold Bay and Jervis Bay and Port Ste-
phens, where nowadays there are scarcely
facilities for constructing a bark canoe.
Then a lot of complications came to pass.
Iron ships took the place of wooden ones,
and it was discovered that Australia, with
all its great natural resources, had no iron
industry worth mentioning. The gold boom
and the loan boom—especially the latter —
rushed up wages to a figure previously un-
heard of, and as no one thought of putting
a duty on imported ships and dredges to
balance the discrepancy between Australian
loan-boom pay and European pay, the Aus-
tralian ship-building industry died out. The
couhtry sang "Rule Britannia” as usual, but
it forgot the sea and the sea-faring ways
and went into the cow business. Such
vessels as were built here were petty craft
which it was almost impossible to import
because they couldn’t face the long sea
voyage. Everything else was bought
abroad. To-uay the Government still pur-
sues the policy of Freetrade in ships and
dredges, but it is uoing a little to restore the
old trade by having some few Government
ships put together at Cockatoo Dock, Syd-
ney and elsewhere. The results are not so
cheering as they might be. It is alleged
that the local Cockatoo Dock ship is two
years late in its construction as compared
with similar ships ordered in England. (The
two years is probably an exaggeration, but a
certain amount of lateness appears to be
beyond dispute.) The Prime Minister’s ex-
planation is to the effect that the building
of big vessels had become so completely a
lost art in this country that men had to be
sent to England to learn it —hence the delay.
But if, through tlm free importation of ships
and dredges, there is to be no work for these
men in Australia except what the Govern-
ment can provide, it was hardly worth while
to send them away for educational purposes.
Nobody is likely to take the building of big
ships seriously if it is only a very occasional
public job paid for out of loans. There is
a tendency to make the best of the job while
it lasts, and it is tainted with the curse that
hangs over all loan jobs—the feeling that the
wages and expenses have no necessary con-
nection with the value of the achievement
because the bill is Posterity’s affair. So
when the exigencies of war made it neces-
sary, in the public interest, to hustle the
work at Cockatoo it was promptly hung up
by a demand that double wages should be
paid for night duty—not wage-and-a-half or
wage-and-tliree-quarters, but a full 40s. in
the £■ A staggered Government said it
couldn’t afford so much, and a wholly
illegal strike ensued. The demand for
double wages and the strike were no
very valuable contributions to the
defence of Australia at a time of stupendous
crisis, but then, as already mentioned, the
free importation of ships and dredges has
made the shipbuilding industry a jest, and
the loan habit has made Government works
partly a subject of mirth and partly a pauper
or relief expedient.
The Super-Quack.
One reason why The Bulletin wants the
electors to answer Yes to the Fisher
party’s Referenda questions is that the re-
moval of the Trade and Commerce clause
may lead to a Commonwealth Pure Advts.
Act —a reform which none of the States
appear likely to undertake themselves.
Every day one can read advts. calling on
men to consult this, that, and the other
“specialist” in “private diseases” and
undertaking a cure in “four to eight days
without the use of mercury.” The so-called
“private disease” which is ordinarily treated
with mercury cannot be cured, even by the
most modern methods, in eight days or
eight months. The irreducible minimum is
three years, and no honest doctor will pledge
himself to eliminate all traces of it even in
that time. The effect of an advertisement
such as the above is disastrous to the in-
dividual and to the community. The ignor-
ant class of sufferer hurries off in quest of
his quick and easy cure. He pays his
money, and, maybe, is actually made to
appear better, the achievement of tempo-
rary effects of the sort being a notoriously
simple matter in cases of syphilis. Mean-
while he remains as great a menace to him-
self and his associates as before. His
health continues to be steadily undermined.
He approaches nearer and nearer to the
stage when no treatment can avail him.
And he is liable to infect those who come
in contact with him. Other advertisers, or
sometimes the same advertisers, offer in ad-
dition to a half-crown gout cure, and a
dirt cheap specific f.or alcoholism, a “Rup-
ture Treatment, 30 days, 55.” A truss
will keep a rupture in place for 30 days, or
300, provided the patient goes on living.
But the only cure is by operation. The
unfortunates who are encouraged to think
otherwise go in needless misery, if not in
peril of their lives. If a man made a
practice of poisoning the community’s tanks
the Law'would deal with him, and it w’ould
not be deterred by the discovery that, under
a delusion, persons paid to have their tanks
infected and their lives destroyed. There
is no material difference between the man
who poisons people on a large scale, and
the man who offers a bogus cure for one of
the most dreadful diseases in existence.
If the State was a logical entity, which it
isn’t, it would treat this kind of '“specialist”
like the murderer he is, and it would deal
with the person who claims to abolish rup-
ture, for 55., without an operation, as one
guilty of doing serious bodily harm and
taking money by a wilfully false pretence.
Dry.
“Ricardo” writes:—
The American Union has now 13 prohibition
States: Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, North
Carolina, West Virginia, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Washington, Colorado, Arizona and
Oregon, The last four were added to the preceding
nine by a recent vote. More than half the popula-
tion of the U.S. is under either general or local
prohibition; for in almost every State there are no-
license counties. Thus, Texas, with a population of
3,896,104, has 3,409,476 under no-license. And
the movement spreads. A trade newspaper, Bar
and Buffet, says: “The temperance sentiment is
sweeping like a great prairie fire-through the coun-
try.”
To which may be added a few conclusions
concerning the operations of prohibition in
Kansas, after 34 years, by Royal E.
Cabell, formerly United States Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue. They were
made public by him a few weeks ago. He
selected Kansas because, as he says, “it is
the only State in which prohibition amounts
to much”:—
According to the 1910 census statistics, Kansas
had in its State hospitals 172.30 insane per 100,000.
Seventeen license States [quoted] had better records.
....In the matter of insane with alcoholic psychosis
admitted to hospitals during 1910, the census report
shows Kansas behind 13 license States [quoted] with
4.41 persons thus admitted per 100,000 of popula-
tion. .. .As to pauperism, official census figures put
Kansas with her rate of 43.49 per 100,000 behind
10 license States [quoted] Kansas’s record in the
divorce line is worse than that of 31 license States
[quoted] according to the latest census figures avail-
able —those for the period 1898-1902, after 20 years
of prohibition. Her average annual divorce rate per
100,000 was 286. In percentage of divorces granted
to wives for drunkenness, 1887-1906, Kansas ranks
even with Idaho and South Dakota (license States),
each having a rate of 3.1 per cent. The Kansas rate
is worse than that of 15 license States [quoted]
In number of juvenile delinquents per 100,000 in
1910 Kansas, with a rate of 25.68, was behind 16
license States [quoted] ... .When it comes to number
of prisoners held for homicide the 1910 census
figures indicate that Kansas, with 11.36 per 100,000,
was worse than 24 license States [quoted]... .In the
number of life prisoners per 100,000 in 1910, Kansas,
with 4.49, made a worse showing than 37 license
States [quoted]... .In the number of prisoners of all
kinds the 1910 census figures put Kansas, with her
rate of 90.34 per 100,000, behind 17 license States
[quoted]... .The number of savings depositors in a
State in proportion to the population of the State
would seem to be a fair barometer of thrift. Judged
by this, Kansas is more improvident than 33 license
States [quoted]. The report of the Comptroller of
the Currency shows that the average savings deposit,
per depositor, in the United States, in 1913, was
439.07d01., while the average savings deposit, per
depositor, in Kansas was 231.69d01.
After that, if prohibition prohibits, what
species of benefits does it confer?
Compulsory Wheat.
The plunging fashion of the N.S.W Gov-
ernment’s wheat-purchase scheme threatens
to get on the nerves of the community,
First it was proposed that the State
should compulsorily buy up the entire loaf-
harvest of N. S. Wales at ss. per bushel. Some-
body pointed out that nearly £4,000,000 in
cash would be required for the opera-
tion, and the Holman Government hasn’t
even £4,000.000 of shortage or deficit. This
was a sort of a difficulty. It was also pointed
out that there was nobody in the Holman
combination who was accused of any special
knowledge re wheat-dealing. Next the Gov-
ernment was invited to explain what the
whole trouble was about, seeing that N. S.
Vales is likely to have far more wheat
than it requires this year. Whether the idea
was to prevent the farmer getting the cur-
rent price for liis goods for the profit of the
Treasury (though the artisan and the bar-
rister still get their current price), or
whether there was a scheme by which the
State Government should annex the Federal
Government’s job of controlling trade and
commerce, or whether it was thought worth
while to rob the producer in order to secure
the vote of the consumer, or whether the
State Government hadn’t realised that meat
and not wheat is the staple food, of this
country, or whether there was a device for
starving the other States by holding up the
N.S.W. wheat surplus, or whether there
were certain wheat speculators who had
sold at a low price for future delivery in a
rising market and wanted to struggle out of
their very bad bargains, or whether it was
simply a case of a very Government
flying round in a misguided attempt to jus-
tify its existence by buying up all the oats
or broad beans or coal-scuttles or sideboards
or cows or bookcases in the commun’ty—
who can tell? At all events the N.S.W.
State Government’s compulsory wheat-pur-
chase scheme, which represented a liability
of nearlv £4,000,000, and a serious infraction
of the Constitution under which the Aus-
tralian Government controls trade and com-
merce, was to have been rushed through the
Sydney Legislature in one sitting. Then
it drifted away into partial obscurity. It
didn’t rush. The Government, apparently
finding that it had leaped at its £4,000,000
liability too recklessly, explained that it
didn’t really pledge itself to buy the whole
crop. The frenzied farmer asked how he
was to know whether his crop was or was
not ear-marked for compulsory purchase, and
whether he was the man who must sell to
Holman at ss. or the bloke who might sell
in London at 6s. 6d. He received a loud
silence in reply. And nobody really knows
where anybody stands.
According to latest advices the troubles of
that poor, emaciated brute, the Australian
capital at Canberra, are not all owing to
Victorian animosity or Federal hostility.
The capital area is small and dry. It
depends mostly on the Queanbeyan and
Molonglo rivers. These gather their waters
in N.S.W. territory. The State cow and
the parochial horse and the disunited and
anti-Federal sheep wallow in the upper
streams and pollute them. As a matter of
pomp and dignity the N.S.W. Government
won’t hand over these catchment areas in
order that the Federal authority may keep
the State goat and the provincial ass. out of
its drinking supply. And the Federal
authority has doubts about a city which
must drink any kind of water that an
extraneous power likes to give it. So it
proceeds slowU
From the Australasian Journalist of
25/11/T4 (page 4) :
Senator F. G. Pearce, the Minister for Defence, is
still considering the question of appointing a jour-
nalist or two on the staff of the Censor to supply the
necessary knowledge of the technical side of news-
paper work, which the system shows itself to be so
sadly deficient in at present.
There is not a newspaper in the Commonwealth
which cannot tell the most amazing stories of the
doings of the Censors. There may be very good
reasons for the actions taken, but they do not appear
on the surface, and no explanations are ever offered.
Things are allowed to be published in some papers
and are rigidly excluded from others. This is said
to have happened in papers published in the same
cities. There appear to be no underlying principles,
nor co-ordination; no continuity of policy, nor any
basis at all.
Each Censor appears to exercise his own individu-
ality. If the instructions ’poured out from time to
time by the Censor were literally applied, there
would apparently be no war news, excepting when it
related to victories of the Allies.
The best way to prevent volunteering is to keep out
the news of the reverses which must occur in such a
war as the present before the enemy is finally crushed,
and in this the Censors are succeeding admirably.
Australia would have been up in arms almost to a
man before this if the public had not been so con-
sistently pap-fed on the marvellous number of Ger-
mans and Austrians who have been killed.
The London Times has several times pleaded for
the relaxation of the censorship, and a few days ago
it gravely announced that it was glad that Great
Britain was awakening to the seriousness of the
struggle. Ye gods! This after 10 weeks of the
bloodiest war in history, and the grimmest struggle
for the very existence of the Empire! We must win,
but a sense of false security fostered by the Censors
will lengthen the struggle.
There are 63 Censors in the Commonwealth, and
according to a statement by Mr. J. Jensen in the
House of Representatives, in reply to a question by
Mr. W. F. Finlayson, they are paid the following
rates per annum: Deputy Chief Censor, £750; Deputy
Censors, £550; Senior Assistant Censors, £500; and
Junior Assistant Censors, £4OO. The pay seems ade-
quate for the eight hours a day they are required to
work. With the stiffening supplied by the inclusion
of a few journalists, it is quite possible that the
system might be made a little less objectionable.
Once Britain really does set up a joss, never
by any chance does the joss get walloped.
Typical josses are Punch, the Royal Acad-
emy, the Boat-race and the Cecil family.
The profundity of faith reposed in these insti-
tutions is simply. Britannic. An Australian
daily paper quotes the late J. A. Cramb,
Professor of Modern History at London, on
the subject of the late Lord Salisbury :
In the matter of Germany he foresaw point by
point her development, and marked but the exact
lines which that development took —from the Kiel
Canal right on to those batteries and Dreadnoughts
concentrated there.
Yet Salisbury was the man who, in 1890,
at a moment when “his primacy in his own
party was unchallenged.” sold Heligoland to
Germany. A habit of mind similar to
Cramb’s prompted a member of the recent
deputation from the Commons to say that
Lord Hugh Cecil was the greatest man in
the House. This was honestly said, by a
man of intelligence, of a House which con-
tained Asquith, John Simon and Church-
ill. ‘ Some similar feeling explains the
toleration of Balfour. This quasi-brilliant
but futile attitudiniser . was endured for
years because he was a Cecil, and therefore
honest and disinterested. Forced in the end
to realise that this joss had to be removed,
Britain did no walloping, but slid a dull and
reliable Scot into the vacant place. Even
Burghley, the famous Minister of Eltza-
beth, did nothing, realiy. Ho had the Cecil
quality of absolutely disinterested patriotism,
but that was all. His most notable achieve-
ment is really typical of this _ family ot
pedants and instinctive ecclesiastics. It was
his marriage to Mildred Cooke, “the most
learned lady of her time.” But these nuptial
exploits by no means entitle Ckamb to
classify him with Pitt, or even Boling-
broke. Only the joss spirit could account
for such a classification.
An attempt to compile a new table of
weights and measures for war news: —
The time is ripe for a classification of the various
war authorities relied on by Australian dailies. On
a recent Sunday “15,000 British” were drowned by
German Official Wireless. The “wireless” quoted is
a joke—except to Germans. On a subsequent Sunday
came a Matin report of several German army corps
“engirdled in a ring of steel.” Le Matin is an
imposing-looking sheet with ornate offices in the
centre of Paris and big hoarding posters all over
France; but it is run by a gang of Yankees, and is
utterly unreliable. The Echo de Paris was quoted
on the preceding day. This paper, along with the
Liberte, the Libre Parole, the Patrie, La Presse
and the Courrier du Soir may likewise be classed as
needing confirmation in such matters. The Excelsior
is run by Pierre Lafitte. He is a bright young man
who believes himself to be a compost of Harms-
worth and Napoleon. His journal in some ways
imitates Harmsworth’s London Daily Mirror. It is
untrustworthy. Rea onably reliable sheets are the
Petit Journal and the Petit Parisien. Each of
these papers has a circulation of over three millions
daily, and costs a sou. Le Temps is so-so. The
two dependable papers of Paris —after all, two is a
big allowance for one city—are Le Journal and Le
Figaro. The Figaro was Gaston Calmette’s paper,
and it was in its offices that Calmette was murdered
by the wife of Joseph Caillaux —an event which
bore out the dictum of Gibson Bowles that “there
never was a thoroughly satisfactory person named
Joseph.” Of London war authorities the Daily Mail
and the Cocoa (Radical) Press are unreliable; the
Daily Telegraph reliable ; the Morning Post doubt-
ful ; the Times used to be better. Any report from Rome
is almost certain to be a lie, and ranks with Yankee
“news.” The telegraphic source is often of more
importance than the journalistic. For instance, the
Exchange Agency and the Central News are to be
relied upon; others, much better known in Aus-
tralia, are under suspicion. Absolutely reliable are
the reports of the British Official Pi ess Bureau and
the Petrograd Official Communiques. So also are the
Paris Official Communiques, save that they are written
in a rather more ornate fashion. Copenhagen and
Dutch reports are sometimes true, but more often
untrue.
The Peacock appeal to Victorian
farmers to sow as much wheat as possible
this year—as if they would do anything
else,. with the prospect of high prices,
provided they can get hold of the seed —
lias brought forth fruit of a sort. A number
of persons have addressed the Minister of
Agriculture saying they have no land and
no wheat and no experience, nor any horses
or implements, but they have sums ranging
up to £IOOO which they propose to invest
in wheat-growing, and they want to be led
to a desirable paddock and be provided with
seed and everything, and have the
whole process explained to them, so that
they can take off their coats and raise 40
bushels to the acre. Nothing could be
simpler. Any fool can grow wheat, just as
any untrained duffer can make bread or
build boots, or produce cloth from wool.
The average city man, who knows nothing
of the country, firmly believes that he can
go on the land and do as well as, or better
than, the human cauliflower who has been
there for years and years. Perhaps one
in 10 succeeds, after paying for his
experience; the rest don’t. For the plain
truth is that wheat-growing, except in a
few favored parts, demands more capital,
greater experience and harder work than
any other rural industry. Victoria’s 1915
wheat yield won’t be increased by 100
bushels as a result of Peacock’s “appeal”;
but generous assistance to the Northern
and North-western farmers, in the shape of
seed wheat and fodder for their stock while
they are putting the crop in, and the blessing
of a straight railway line to a port which
isn’t so far off as bloated Melbourne, might
easily mean an extra yield of several million
bushels.
The Yankee —at least under President
Wilson —is a poor friend, despite all the
familiar gags about the re-union of the
Anglo-Saxon race, and the blood that is
“thicker than water.” During the last few
weeks the U.S. Government has decided
that the proposal of certain South Ameri-
can republics to declare a neutral zone round
the .coast and keep all combatants off —
which would, of course, give authority to
the U.S. and Brazilian and Argentine and
Chilian fleets to chase the prowling German
commerce-destroyer over the horizon —can-
not be entertained. Britain, with its num-
erous possessions in the Pacific and the
Atlantic, all of which would be at the ser-
vice of its .allies, doesn’t require to steal
uninhabited islands on the South American
coast as naval bases, so apparently the sug-
gestion of .the so-called Latin republics was
wholly friendly to the Allies. Again it
has beep announced that the obscure little
United 'States army of about 90,000 men
can’t be increased at this crisis lest it
should seem that Uncle Sam: was arming
against Germany. Incidentally, the sailors
of the U.S. fleet have been ordered to leave
off singing “It’s a Long Way to Tipperary”
—presumably lest it should annoy the
Kaiser. President Wilson appears, one

way and another, to be so much addicted
to peace that he is hardly worth having as
an acquaintance in these stormy days. Yet
his country is simply yearning to sell us
goods and take our cash in exchange. And
N.S.W. is paying Commissioner Nielsen,
Holman’s old colleague, £4 a day, together
with a vast sum for office expenses, travel-
ling expenses, railway expenses, and em-
ployees’ salaries, to represent the Ma State
in Wilson’s country.
The War and the Frost and the
Impecuniosity.
There has been a dull week of carnage, with
few outstanding features except heaps of
dead bodies. At both sides the Prussian
Brute has been shoved a little way back.
On the Belgian border a cottage on a hill,
which has been taken and re-taken by all
parties for a month, has at last fallen to
the Allies. Probably there is no cottage left
by now, and as for the baby which used to
lead a happy life in the kitchen it has van-
ished. A great silence now prevails about
the German capture of London and Paris
and Calais and Warsaw —especially Warsaw.
The Russian is getting into his stride, and
bringing up another few thousand men every
few minutes, and the German can now
hardly disguise the fact that in Poland he
is fighting for his life. The Czar’s army is
drifting into Hungary, and the Hungarians,
whose troops are away protecting the route
to Vienna, have appealed to that Emperor
who can never be found these days, asking
if they are to be eaten up by Bears without
any real show of defence. The Emperor
who can never be found doesn’t appear to
have replied. The Turkish invasion of Egypt
seems to have dissolved into mist, and the
threatened invasion of Russia has gone the
same way. At least, the latest news was of
a muddy and terrified person with a fez
fleeing towards Van. Winter has fallen
heavily on Europe, and the Bear, who finds
in winter his familiar element, is the most
joyous of the fighters. The three small mem-
bers of the Alliance are not feeling too good.
In Belgium the whole population is on the
verge of starvation. Servia has abandoned
its capital city to the Austrians —in fact,
after four months’ bombardment there was
hardly anything to abandon —but its army is
putting up the usual heroic scrap at the old
address. Montenegro holds out a battered
and ruined hat for contributions “in cash or
kind.” It hasn’t lost a battle, but about
one-third of the male population has perished
in the process of winning battles. The other
two-thirds is as cheerful and strenuous as
ever, provided it can get a plate of beans
now and then ; but, as it hasn’t been able to
plant any crops or do other payable work for
a long time, the King, aged 73, inquires with
anxiety if his richer allies can lend some
food and a few cartridges. The naval battle
is still postponed owing to the backward
and lurking habits of the German
navy. Still it was reckoned last week
that already Britain had lost 17 vessels (five
of them of 12,000 tons or more), while the
Germans have lost 32 (the biggest being
9350 tons), and have quite a number of
craft bailed up in neutral harbors. A cer-
tain amount of smash has happened among
smalt French, Russian and Austrian vessels.
This sort of thing would have been called
real naval warfare 100 years ago, but now
things are on so large a scale that it is only
regarded as a preliminary row or peevishness
among the small deer of the sea. It is a sign
of the times that Germany has apologised to
Portugal for certain acts of hostility. Four
months ago Germany wouldn’t have apologised
to all the heavenly host. King George V. has
paid a visit to the fighting line —the first
British monarch to go there since the days
of George 11. and the battle of Dettingen.
And amid all the frost, and the bloodshed,
and the heaps of dead, and the obliteration of
cities, and the upheaval of nations which are
putting even old grandfather into the fighting
line; and the lack of time to bury the
deceased, and the utter starvation of commu-
nities which, a few months ago, were among
the richest in the world ; and the appeals of
poor but valiant kings to their richer allies
for the loan of a gun and a bag of flour—-
certain women of New York have held a pro-
cession by way of protest against the war.
And, no doubt, they chewed gum while they
proceshed.
Richmond (Vic.) City Council lias_ a
municipal gymnasium connected with its
swimming baths, and now it opens a

Auckland (M.L.) indulged in a Belgium
Week recently, during which Carrie Moore
and an attractive consignment of theatrical
maddens occupied a gaily-decorated lorry,
from which they sold flowers and kisses.
The latter were priced at a guinea, and for
that sum gay young sparks were invited to
mount the lorry and kiss any girl in the
bunch. It called for more pluck than cash
to climb up and take delivery of the goods.
All the same, over £9O was realised on the
first day in this way.

A somewhat ragged version of “The
Mikado” occupies Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
till Saturday, when “Patience” starts a
three-nights’ run. For the final perform-
ance of the season (December 16), theatre-
goers are now choosing their favorite opera
by ballot. Ruth Lincoln (Yum Yum) and
G. Villiers Arnold (Pish Tush) are the
most satisfactory members of “The Mikado”
cast —Ruth on account of her charm and
animation, and G. Villiers because he makes
an holiest and successfiil effort to realise
the character. His make-up is excellent and
his repertoire of “attitudes queer and quaint”
would cover a whole gallery of fans. With
admirable restraint Charles Walenn (Ko-
Ivo) refrains from painting his nose red and
introducing a slapstick; otherwise his inter-
pretation is perfectly free. Frank Wilson’s
Mikado can sing well enough, but that is
the end of it. Edward McKeown is sweet
and heavy as Nanki Poo, and Albert Kavan-
agh, as Pooh-Bah, unconsciously plagiarises
Bantock’s Rajah of Bhong. Dorothy Vane
can only be described as a dusty Pitti Sing,
or she was on the night this paper saw her;
and Ethel Morrison (Katisha) makes a half-
hearted attempt to disguise her good looks
and sings her music with considerable expres-
sion. But the best member of the cast is
the chorus, and if the principals would live
up to the standard set by that efficient
body, this show, like the others in the co.’s
repertoire, would be many degrees better
than it is.

On .Friday the “Seven Keys to Baldpate”
will be returned to the caretaker at Sydney
Criterion, and on Saturday the admirable
Niblo company will introduce to a Sydney

based on a chewing-gum foundry, or arsenal,
this paper hopes it will not be an elaborate
advertisement to popularise a disgusting
United States habit.

In “The Philanderer,” staged by the
Gregan McMahon co. at Melbourne Athe-
naeum on Saturday, Barney Shaw success-
fully sustains the role of comedian without
forgetting that his stipendiary job is that
of wit and philosopher. The comedy doesn’t
display any remarkable craftsmanship, but
Shaw manages to extract much original fun,
while exercising his sententiousness to the
full limit permissible in a four-act show. The
main personage is Leonard Charteris, the
tender page in the life stories of Julia Craven
and Mrs. Tranfield, and the bored hero of
other sultry adventures, who, despite his
languors and superiah manners, strikes one
as a cold-blooded, common canoodler more or
less disguised beneath a Shaw education.
Anyhow, he is the mouthpiece of Barney’s
learning throughout, and is the wicked
weapon, forged with levity aforethought, to
puncture the amour propre of two heavy
fathers and the fat-headed inventor of a liver
complaint. The last mentioned, Dr. Para-
more, is the most useful man in the play,
inasmuch as he serves as a chopping-block
for the author’s medical prejudices and pro-

For its owner dead was he,
Yet it stood on its neck with a smile well-bred

vides a refuge for artful Julia Craven, when,
having lost her Cliarteris by inferior diplo-
macy, she looks for fresh flats and conquests
new. Played by PI. Chubb, Paramore was
not a convincing person. Chubb’s idea is
that to win success in love a doctor would
doff his scientific solemnity and affect the
vacuous gaiety of a pierrot. The two
fathers, Craven and Cutlibertson, were inter-
preted by Gregan McMahon and Hugh Rose,
the former neatly picturing the effects of a
torpid liver, while the latter, called upon to
suggest a testy temperament, disobliged
with a sketch of an indignant public speaker.
Nicholas Joy was fluent as Cliarteris, but
his over-studied coolness suggested that his
philanderings with Julia and Mrs. Tranfield
had never even the excuse of a decent emo-
tional appetite. Miss Beatrice Day revealed
a fine insight into the character of Julia;
Miss Handley had the minor part of Sylvia;
and Mrs. Jerrold Joske’s nervous mismanage-,
ment of voice and hands was not compatible
with the repose demanded of Mrs. Tranfield.
The scenery was as accurate as the limited
stage would allow, but the general color
scheme and the furniture of Acts I and IY
would probably give the learned author a
bilious attack. Next Saturday a somewhat
different McMahon co., including Miss Day,
will devote its attention to “Peter’s Mother.”

Saturday will see the final flutter of “The
Girl in the Taxi,” at Her Majesty’s (Melb.).
During the greater part of next week the
theatre will be closed while preparations are
made for the upheaval of the “Cinderella”
panto, on the 19th inst.
* * * *
The attraction at Melbourne Princess’s
this week is “The Girl Who Took the Wrong
Turning,” urged thereto by her own discon-
tent and the soft words of a dubious charmer
from London. The latter female gets in her
deadly tongue in Act I, and nearly another
act passes before the Girl’s sailor-lover
learns that she has gone to see life through
a wineglass darkly and needs to be Saved.
Mariner Bill thereupon gyabs his faithful
parrot and a day’s commissariat in a large
bandana, and goes to London in search of the
Sophie of his choice. After much trouble,
mainly due to Bill’s unruly desire for com-
bat, the soiled dove is rescued from a gilded
aviary and restored to tfie small cage she
occupied in the country. Miss Dorise plays
the girl; Conway is the 1 dauntless seaman;
and Miss Gresham, cast for a person of
precipitous character, might pass for a fast
lady in Geelong. There is nothing to be

The chief item of news from Melbourne
Bijou this week is the reappearance of
Josephine Gassman and her cullud retinue
in a fresh outbreak of song and niggah non-
sense. Sam La Mert, whistler and mimic,
is a welcome addition to the Bijou brigade,
and the patter and parodies of Ray and
Ray are very bearable. Reg YVykeham and
Pressy Preston have dropped “My Friend
Smith” and are trying the effect of a new
sketch, “Not in These” ; while the Noo Yark
Comedy party continues to squash all oppo-
sition in the matter of humorous quartette
singing.
At Melbourne Tivoli J. YV. Rickaby is
repeating his libel on the common cop, and
continues to demonstrate the humors of a
battered London swell. Alfredo fiddles
trickily as before, and the arrival of the
Maze acrobats is noted with approval, tem-
pered by commiseration for the ungainly
character who tumbles from various heights
with monotonous frequency. Three other
newcomers who provide a mixed song and
tango turn call themselves the Soho Trio.
Why they should carry this name no man
knows.

Nigel Brock’s Green Dandies maintain the
cheerful tenor of their entertainment at St.
Ivilda (Vic.). Excepting a recently-added Bel-
gian fiddler, who escaped from Antwerp with
his knowledge of Wieniawski and other com-
posers unimpaired, the Dandies are the same
old attractive party, with Renn Millar head
ing the heavy vocal division, and Messrs.
Mack, Walton and Graham performing feats
of valor in the humorous department. Mack
and Graham are repeating themselves
successfully in selections from the comic
classics, hut Walton has been lately caught
in the act of exploding some fresh jests in
the faces of the audience, and will probably
be court-martialled and shot for conduct
unbecoming a Green Dandy.

Still another Melbourne picture show: —
On the evidence of the picture show at his Collins-
street studio, Leslie Wilkie deserves a medal for
conspicuous gallantry in the field of portraiture.
Barring some minor landscapes and a pleasing study
of a whiskered patriarch, all Wilkie’s efforts depict
robust young flapperhood in various stages of pre-
sentableness, from fancy raiment to complete undress.
The Clothed Damsel is generally nice enough to eat,
and the large quantities of Undressed Kid, lolling
about in emergency attitudes, and trying to temper
their nudity by grabbing a book or a dish of fruit,
are calculated to turn a Wowser into a Cannibal
King. “Muriel,” with her pink scarf and the lips
of a young enchantress, looks like the pearl of tins
pictorial harem; but “In the Foyer,” “Lucrezia,”
“The Blue Shoe” and several others are taking demon-
strations of beauty in an unripe state.
New shows and amateur shows are having
an innings in Adelaide. The Appendreena
Society, which generally ■ plays to invited
audiences, repeated “Eliza Comes to Stay”
at the Star (which is the old Tivoli) before
the most brilliant audience that house has
seen for a long time. Proceeds to the Bel-
gians. Von Treuer was again the slap-dash
hero of the Esmond sentimental comedy, and
Zoe Reid the unlikely heroine who changes
from gutter-girl to charmer —and back —
with such rapidity. The first rain for
months beat on the iron roof and damaged
the first act, but the rest went audibly and
well. The Repertory Theatre, too, revived
Moore’s “Strike at Arlingford”—which
seems to be a breach of an implied contract
to stage only the unknown. The unsatis-

sketches of the elderly butt so dear to the

The King’s has got in Davis and Gledhul

side, where it needed strengthening. Others
are Ella Airlie at the piano; Phil Percival,
who brings in some jokes that need censor-
ing; and the unpretentious comic-singer, Ted

Branscombe’s Dandies continue their open-
air career serenely, and the most striking
film in sight is the historic “Birkenhead”

“Melody”: The intense patriotism of the
average German teacher probably drives him
or herr to teach the pupils the dear old grunts
of the Fatherland, and a good working know-
ledge of said grunts is probably essential if a
young singer intends to storm Europe. But
when she’s at home amongst her own folk,
let us have English—or, if not English, the
melodious French or Italian. An emotional
German love song with its “achs” always
gives me the idea that somebody is trying to
express her disgust at the state of the drains.
“W.D.” on Paris in war time: —
Kipling says we always remember places by a
smell, and in “Lichtenberg,” perhaps the most com-
plete of liis lyrics, he tells of an Australian trooper
to whom came suddenly on the African veldt the
perfume of the wattle in the rain. But I shall
always remember Paris now by a sound, and the old
associations of smell will be submerged. All the
chief instruments of noise were gone. All wheeled
vehicles had been taken for the army, and all horses.
In the Quartier de l’Opera, the world’s hub of merry
sounds, there were no chattering consommateurs at
the round little tables in front of the cafes, and no
music came through the caf6 doors. The struggling,
vituperating cochers, forever going under in a mighty
swirl of traffic, were silent at last. The cries of “La
Presse,” “La Patrie” and “La Liberty,” the whip-
cracks and protestings, the hoots and com-
plicated threnodies of the unending streams of
cars, the heat, rush, wealth, cold, sweat, penury,
sorrow and joy, and everything else that once made
up this intricate and ever-rushing dynamo of human
energies had vanished. The streets were silent and
empty, but the sidewalks were thronged. Except for
children and a few stunted males the people on
them were women, and they all kept walking onwards,
not because the shopwindows were closed, but because
the crowd was preoccupied. Talk there was and
enough of it; but. governing all the main motifs of
the city’s life, and overpowering it like an inter-
minable diapason, came the ceaseless shuffling of
feet—the sound that will recall Paris to me all my
days.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Monkbarns”: About 60 years ago John
Dunn was a London favorite, giving an
imitation of a nigger performer whom lie
called Jim Crow Rice. Dunn came to Aus-
tralia with his wife, two little daughters
(Rosa and Marion) and a son (John,
junior). Dunn himself made good in Mel-
bourne as a low comedian; and Rosa
developed so quickly that she took leading
juvenile parts at the age of 13. She was
the original in Melbourne of the Colleen
Bawn, and was unrivalled for pathos. She
broke her professional engagement with
Barry Sullivan in 1863 by marrying L. L.
Lewis, corn broker, and was replaced by
Rose Edouin. Marion Dunn came forward
in an almost equally rapid way. She was
not equal to Rose, but had a sprightly turn
lacking in the other. Somewhere about her

last appearance before marriage was in
Gilbert’s “Vivandiere, or True to the Corps,
at the Melbourne Royal. There was a popu-
lar quartette, including a skit on Mont-
gomery, by Marion Dunn, Maggie Stewart,
Alice Woodbridge and Alice Bray. Marion
married Marcus Clarke in 1869, she being
22 and he 24. This caused an estrangement
with Rosa which was never quite healed.
Marcus and Marion looked a delicate couple,
but their four sons and two daughters are
all doing well. Marcus died in 1881. Mrs.
Clarke, who died the other day, ultimately
settled for a number of years in the old Dis-
trict Court house as Registrar of Births,
Marriages and Deaths.
Fanny Whiteside Brough, whose death is
reported by cable, was born in Paris in July,
1854, daughter of Robert Brough and his
wife Elizabeth Romer, She made her _ first
appearance at Manchester in 1869 in a
panto written by her Uncle Boh. While
there she also played Ophelia to the Hamlet
of Barry Sullivan. She had a very active
and successful career, and, in later years, as
president of the Ladies’ Theatrical Guild,
devoted herself to the improvement of the
position of her sisters in the profession.
She was a sister of Australia’s old friend,
Robert Brough, and off the stage was Mrs.
R. S. Bolevn.
Harry Roberts has got into harness again,
this time with a company of his own to go
north. “The Prince Chap” and “Hans the
Boatman” are on the bill. The last time
Roberts was exceptionally busy was when
he produced “Du Barry,” on Nellie
Stewart’s recent reappearance in Sydney
Royal. The fine work done then was largely
due to Roberts’s experience in producing the
piece with Belasco in the United States.
“Masetto”: Fanny Whiteside Brough, just
dead in London, saw 45 years on the stage
and about 60 of mere life, and in that respect
scored better than most of the family. With
the exception of Lionel, who got as far as
72, Fanny’s relations died unfairly early.
She had a very wide range of parts, but her
conspicuous hits were Mary O’Brien in the
“Real Little Lord Fauntleroy,” and Mrs.
Egerton Bompas in Pinero’s “The Times.”
She played with (amongst others) Potter
and Bellew, Hare, Kendall, Harris, Hawtrey
and Alexander. Boleyn, whom she married,
was a player too, but he was never more
than Fanny Brough’s husband.
“Piccadilly”: Sydney Tivoli “Follies” is
the first revue Australia has seen. “Come
Over Here” was merely a bastardised
musical comedy. The Mclntosh production
is the real thing, witli two defects: there
is too long a wait before it comes on ; and
current doings are not sufficiently empha-
sised. ■ All turns before an “event of the
evening” should be just calculated to keep
the house going till the train-missers have
arrived. It seems a pity to waste A 1
Hermann, as a turn, when he might be
getting in fine work in the real part of the
show. He is the ideal man for. such an
act as Hugh Wright’s in “Kill that Fly”
at London Alhambra, where Wright did the
“Guy” song in front of the curtain.
Plermann is one of the few who has got
the “bang” to do the act. Therefore ram
him in and let people properly enjoy him
instead of having to wonder all the time
whether they would sooner have him finish
or have the revue come in and interrupt him.
“Theorbo”: If I rightly gauge who
“Masetto” (B. 3/12/T4) is, he knows more
about St. Francis’s, Melbourne, than I do.
So I accept his statement that Giorza’s
Masses are relegated to the lumber-room.
Yet it is very few years since I heard one
of them at St. Francis’s, and it would be
30 years after Giorza deposited it there. I
was surprised that the uncongenial Giorza
had written a Mass, and learned that the
archives contained another. On my hearing
of the one it would not astonish me to find
both fumigated and brought to light again.
Giorza is, at any rate, not more operatic
than Haydn. If the work I heard is. aban-
doned it can only be for a lack of originality
in a delicious pasticcio, suggestive of
Mercadante. Apart from pious feeling, I
never heard a more delightful. Mass than
Giorza’s. Pius X. condemned such as
Giorza, Mozart, Haydn, Weber, Gounod and
Guilmant at one pop, but Pius X. doesn’t
count now.
The father of Mischa Elman, who accom-
panied his son to Australia, has told the
N’York Jewish Tageblatt what he thinks of
the place and the people. There is nothing
of much consequence or interest in the
He searched in vain in Sydney and Mel-
bourne for poor Jewish quarters. But he
found something else in Melbourne; a won-
derful Chazan, or Singer of the Ritual——the
Rev. J. Lenzer. Even in the United States,
where the best-paid men are, it would be
hard, he says, to find Rabbi Lenzer’s equal in
this respect.
“Harrison O.”: Barry Lupino vouches for
the truth of this. A mummer was notified
that after the end of the month the show
would try to stagger along without him, his
trouble being not that he loved art less, but
that he loved beer more. The pro. played
the part of a judge, who, in the trial scene,
condemned the hero to transportation. On
the last night of his engagement ’s’Onor re-
fused to listen to anything against the noble
youth, and discharged him without a stain
on his halo, to an accompaniment of cheers
from the gods. Still, the histrion’s revenge
was not worth much, as the appearance in
the next act of the hero working in a con-
vict settlement was accepted without
comment. The anachronism, solecism,
anomaly or plain imbecility which a
bellowdrama audience will not accept has not
yet been discovered.

“Boh”: What’s the matter with the com-
poser of “The Girl in the Taxi”? There
isn’t enough exit music to get the
chorus off the stage, and the rear rank
has to tread on the others’ heels to get clear
before the dialogue begins. I am told that,
when the show began, the chorus people
managed to get out before the melody
drained away; but, perhaps as the result
of a long run, the girls seem to be getting
footsore. At any rate, they don’t step
out as they used to. Ladies are
still “dressing the stage” when they
should be back in their dressing-rooms, and
now and then the click of a high-heeled shoe
or the ghost of a sigh gives a real homey
air to the piece. I remember how Bert

St Albans, while he was on his way to
London. The car skidded and over-turned,
and he had his shoulder dislocated. But, his
most important mishap was the one in which
Lady Tree narrowly escaped death. Her
face was so knocked about that it was feared
she would be disfigured for life. With truly
feminine fortitude she sat motionless, leaving
her seemingly devastated features untouched,
till a surgeon of note was reached. He fixed
her up, ultimately, so that most of the
of the calamity were obliterated.
Parliament takes an evening off
Federal politicians destroyed a large pile of pro-
visions in a “good-bye” dinner to Ryrie, M.H.R., at
Commonwealth Parliament House week. The
burly Liberal, who is leaving for the Front by an
early troopship, was toasted in a manner that frac-
tured official decorum at an early stage of the pro-
ceedings, and left party foes temporarily bubbling
with good-fellowship. After the food and the inevi-
table speeches the evening slipped into laughter and
song. John Thompson, invariably silent in the
Reps., warbled a ballad, and the voices of ex-Speaker
Johnson and Senator “Curly” Keating were raised
in recitation. Warrior Ryrie himself supplied an
effective whistling solo, and Prime Minister Andy
Fisher positively beamed when the whiskers of
Livingston, M.H.R., parted in a ;soulful tribute to
the Wee Deoch and Don is. The hit of the evening
was an impromptu imitation of a great pianist by
the fingers of “Billy” Hughes on the tablecloth.
The company was visibly touched by a member’s
pathetic elocution anent, the “Blue Ribbon in Her
Hair.” Finla.vson, M.11.R., was particularly affected
by this item, which was the only notice his favorite
token received during the whole entertainment.
The City Council of Sydney made an
heroic effort the other day to get one wages
board for all its employees, except its clerks
—clerks being unworthy of a wages board,
or too giddily affluent to need one—but
failed. The Council’s employees number
2300, of whom 1089 are working under one
wages board and 340 under another, leaving
less than 300 to be considered; yet, alto-
gether, the Council has to observe 19 awards
whereby different employees get holidays on
different days, different rates of overtime,
different hours and different conditions.
Some have to be paid at the job they are
engaged upon, and others at the Town Hall;
and some have to be paid in the Council’s
time and some afterwards. A dozen different
unions shrieked wildly against any alteration
in this muddled arrangement, and one, the
Municipal Employees’ Union, which aims at
including all kinds of municipal employees,
and supported the proposed change, was
loftily told' that it was “unique in the
history of unionism to find employees coming
to the court to assist the employers.” The
many-voiced shriek prevailed, and the 19
awards will continue to puzzle the City
Council’s paymaster. But Justice Heydou
gave a distant assurance that things might
be altered in 1916, when the Laborers’ Award
—which controls the conditions of the 1689
employees referred to —expires. The 19
separate arrangements seem boundless
insanity.
A curious Yankee philanthropist is men-
tioned in the cablegrams. The story is that
Charles Slingsby, who owns a large estate
in Yorkshire (England), badly wanted a
son. Thereupon his wife, who was living at
Vancouver (Canada), had a son who was
still-born. But the child of Lilian Anderson,
of San Francisco (U.S.A.), was substituted
for the deceased infant, and under the name
of Teddy (not Teddy Bear) was passed on
Charles Slingsby as his heir, to the grievous
detriment of Charles’s two brothers. Dr.
Fraser, of San Francisco, says he attested
to Teddy’s bogus parentage, not for pelf or
lucre, but out of regard for Lilian Anderson’s
“good name.” Now he deliberately blights
her good name and calls himself a lying hound
into the bargain, by going back on his story.
A plausible idea is that the Yankee doctor
was naid for the first'story, and has been
paid for the second anecdote, and if he gets
some more payment he may tell a third yarn
which will be quite unlike the other two.
This narrative has no relation at all to the
case of the lady at Marrickville (Sydney),
who fell down dead last week on account of
an escaped monkey ; nor the fact that some
scoundrel —probably a German —has tried to
poison the water supply at Cairns (N.
Queensland). But there seems to be no
doubt of the truth of the assurance that
British soldiers have been ordered not to
carry with them picture postcards which hold
the Kaiser up to ridicule. The obvious idea
is that the Kaiser is already so ridiculous
that it is absurd to labor the point.

The cheap failure achieved by De AVet
seems to be due to the motor-car. The
horse is still a noble animal; but it isn’t
the whole circus any more. Providing the
motorist is willing to spend his tyres like
water and take risks, the whirring engine
can be hurled across bad country at a speed
that makes the hoofed contrivance look
silly ; and it can keep it up long after the
machine with the fiy-wliisk at the stern has
fallen down dead of exhaustion and become
vulture-food. If De Wet had secretly
accumulated a park of armored motors he
might have been going yet and playing
•Hades. But, apparently, he was a mere
horse-general to the end.
NOT PLAIN TO THE EYE.
LANDLADY (to Smith, wio objects to his chop): "I give you good plain food, and you’ll
have to be content with it."
SMITH : “ Good plain food? But it isn't pain. Confound it, madam , it's almost invisible."
From the N.S.W. Parliamentary reports:
Colonel Onslow asked if it was not a fact that
there were among the unemployed young men who
should volunteer for the war, instead of making a
nuisance of themselves in the street.
The obvious reply of the young meu is that
the war has been raging now for. some
months and Colonel Onslow is still in our
midst. Colonel Onslow doesn’t go,, pre-
sumably, because he can’t get a brigade.
They don’t go, presumably, because they
can’t get commissions. The ideal patriot
is Colonel Onslow’s Labor friend, Larkin,
M.L.A., who, though almost middle-aged,
and married and the father of a family, and
one who had never known the .glory of
wearing a military uniform, joined the
ranks as a private immediately war was
declared. But patriots of the Larkin
stamp are rare; and because they are. rare,
the only safe policy is universal service—a
reform which would rope in all classes,
from Colonels down to wharf-lumpers.
* * * *
Apparently Servia, the valiant little
country which grows pigs, is not doing too
well. It had been mixed up in two wars
in two years before the present trouble
started. Then an Austrian subject shot an
Austrian prince in Austrian territory, and
Austria made that fact the excuse for a
third Servian war, out of which the present
world-wide complication developed. Servia
was up to the neck in battle before France
or Britain or Russia started. By reason
of its remoteness no French or British
troops came to its aid as in the case of
Belgium. Except for the help of a handful
of mountaineers from Montenegro the brown-
clad army had to hoe its own row. In
proportion to its population Servia put a
bigger force into the field than any other
combatant. Still it was the side-show or
forlorn hope among the Allies. The Serb
capital faced a four-months’ bombardment,
until at last it is little better than a heap
of hot dust. Belgrade being unfortunately
placed with only the Danube between it and
Austria, can be pounded to pieces from
Austrian territory. Twice the Servians
made a great effort to break into Austria
and stop the attack, but the odds were too
heavy. Now the Austrians have scored
their one and only success, inasmuch as they
have occupied the coal-scuttleful of ashes
which was once a picturesque old Roman
city. It isn’t much of a triumph seeing
that the capture only represents a few
square miles of ground, but it is rough on a
gallant little nation of pig-raisers. No other
community is so devoted to the side of bacon
and the hog’s trotter. Its great national
hero, Milosch Obrenovitch, who drove out
the Turkish oppressor and became the
founder of a line of kings, was a trader in
swine. Possibly it was his hog-knowledge
which specially qualified him to deal witn
the Turk —that person being a good deal of
a debased animal himself.
THE LEISURED LIFE.

“Callan F.” sees salvation ahead :
Numbers of Australians, myself included, accepted
commissions in our old volunteer army for what I
may term Government House purposes. The uni-
forms were attractive. Some of them were beautiful
—more especially the mess costumes of the Lancer
regiments. To make money as a civilian by day, and
to be privileged to dress the part of a cavalry officer
by night—this was the end of our desires. Speak-
ing for myself—and I represent a considerable body
of opinion—l never wanted to fight anyone. Being
driven to it, I helped on one occasion to put it across
some indifferently-armed Indian tribes-men, and I also
engaged reluctantly with the Boers. But this Euro-
pean trouble is different. Had I suspected it was
coming, no spectacular considerations on earth would
have got me into a uniform.
I am not influenced merely' by the consideration
that the German system of compulsory service has
somehow evolved, despite the prognostications to the
contrary of our advocates of a volunteer army, a
most dangerous lot of soldiers. My reluctance does
not emanate entirely from the discovery that, under
a fiscal policy of rigid Protection, these misguided
people have built? up tremendous industries, which
render them difficult to assail economically, and which
have enabled them to put into the field of battle
guns and other armaments of a most lethal descrip-
tion. Apart from these manifest perils there are
others almost equally horrible. Take rheumatism.
Such is my dread of it that I would sooner absent
myself from a Government House dinner-party than
go to it in a damp tunic. Imagine a warrior, with
a constitution like mine, having to stand, not for a
few hours, but for days and nights, in a trench
three-parts full of water and ice! A draught gives
me a cold in the head which lasts at least a week,
and leaves me a wreck. The Front appears to be all
draught—-an unceasing southerly filtered through an
ice-chest.
In brief, the proceedings of the past two months
have dispelled my illusions with regard to a military
life. I propose to send in pry papers without delay,
taking the point that to enter the lists against pro-
fessionals—as these miserable Germans unquestion-
ably are —-would endanger my amateur status. And,
doubtless, others will follow my example.
But all need not be lost as regards uniforms.
There remains the Consular service; and for freedom-
loving volunteer officers, revolted at the carryings-on
of soldiers trained under the compulsory system, it
should afford a congenial harbor of refuge. I may be
met with the argument that all the consulships are
already filled. Granted! But cannot others be
created? There are scores of places which might
usefully be represented. For instance, the Republic
of Andorra, Monaco, Tonga and the Liberian Republic.
It is true that the Andorrans are no travellers. But
what of that? One of them might come to Australia
and desire to be shown round ; and, meanwhile, there
would be the more time for his Consul to engage in
reproductive work of benefit to the community. The
great need is that the Consul should be effectively
uniformed, and so both impress the represented party
and do credit to the latter's native land. Who
better fitted for such a service than an ex-volunteer
officer ?
Mr. Asquith lately remarked: “This is a war of
small nationalities.” He might have said, with equal
truth, “of multitudinous consulates.” When the
wretched business is over and the German Empire
dissolved, there will be consulships for all. The gay
uniform of the Consul for Schleswig-Holstein will be
seen at socials, and that of the representative of
Herzegovina at afternoon At Homes. And never again
will peaceful citizens be offered the choice between
death and public odium as a reward for helping on
the cause of the Beautiful and the Picturesque.

“The Snake” : Uncle Sam spends half his
time these days telling us through his nose
that “blood is thicker than water.” I wish
he would make it mud instead of blood. It
would mean as much and be a change.
Mysterious cable messages keep arriving
about one Casement —Sir Roger Casement.
“Many people demand that he should be
deprived of his pension.” His crime is not
specified, but it is safe to assume that he is
at his old game of atrocity-mongering—this
time probably in relation to the British
troops. Casement started in the lower ranks
of the Consular service. After spending
about 15 years in Guinea, the Gaboons,
Congo Free State and such places, he got
along to Para and Putomayo. From Puto-
mayo he went to London with frightful tales
of atrocities committed on rubber-getting
Indians. The rubber was owned by British
companies, and the British “Cocoa Press”
(Daily News, Chronicle, etc.), ever
delighted to hear of anything atrocious
done by Britons abroad, hailed Case-
ment as a bringer of good tidings.
There was nothing else much doing
in the news line, and Putomayo Indians
were daily grilled, fried, boiled, flayed and
vivisected at a halfpenny a time until at
last a Commission was appointed to inquire.
Casement gave evidence, and he fried the
Indians all over again. A leading Spaniard
from the arraigned locality came over speci-
ally to London to say that Casement was
every kind of a liar. Finally, everybody
except the Cocoa crowd got so sick of it ail
that they compromised by firing the Spani-
ard and giving Casement a knighthood.
Now the Cocoa people are in the position of
having to explain him away. At latest
advices “his friends suggest that he is suffer-
ing from mental derangement.” It may be
true. Fifteen years of the “pegs” and
sweats of Guinea and the Gaboons are
enough to unsettle any man.

You detect a lady fair,
With those alabaster limbs
That attract the early hims.

Here they flap in dressing-gowns;
Through the Norfolk pines that stand
’Twixt the asphalt and the sand.

’Neath the trees you’ll notice more !....

Each green breaker as it curls
Shows the sea is full of pearls.

When the war is finished, and the
Kaiser has hanged himself, and the in-
demnity has been collected, and the terri-
torial readjustments have been fixed up, it
may be advisable to take some stock of the
habits and methods of royal marriages. Ihe
prevailing theory is that a sovereign should
only marry into a royal family. It may
be a reigning family or it may be a de-
posed institution; still the halo of royalty
hangs round it even if it is deposed, and it
is still eligible, provided it is in the
Almanacii de Gotha. Germany has about
ten times as many royal families as all the
rest of Europe put together, therefore
almost every dynasty in Europe is largely
German, and is loaded down with German
connections and hangers-on. The royalties
of Britain, Belgium, Holland, itoumania,
Greece and Bulgaria are mostly German.
William of Wied, the temporary king of
Albania, was wholly German. The Danish
and Spanish and Russian dynasties are to
some extent German. The rulers at Berlin
and Vienna are almost wholly German. The
German influence, by reason of the multi-
plicity of its potentates and the amazing
number of its inter-marriages, is everywhere.
When the war is over, as already suggested,
and the Kaiser has hanged himself, as
already hinted at, one of the conditions of
peace might be that, when a new State is
established, like Roumania or Greece or
Bulgaria or Albania, no German need apply.
There are plenty of good soldiers and states-
men in Europe and Spanish America who
would gladly take the job.
Another condition might be that every
prince of Europe must marry a girl
of his own country. There are nc
end of nice girls in England, Scot-
land, Ireland or Wales that a British
prince might marry, and there is absolutely
no necessity to rake Prussia, Bavaria,
Wurtemberg, Baden, Hesse, Mecklenburg-
Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the king-
dom of Saxony, the grand duchy of Saxony,
Oldenburg, Brunswick, Saxe-Meiningen,
Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Anhalt,
Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-
Rudolstadt, Waldeck, Reuss (elder branch),
Reuss (younger branch), Schaumburg-
Rippe, and Lippe in order to find him a
wife. In Ireland especially there are
maidens who can show descent from kings
who were old and respectable when most
of the Saxe and Schwarzburg and Schaum-
burg crowd were in the bear-and-hog state
of civilisation. By some unexplained set of
circumstances the Almanacii de Gotha, a
purely. German publication, has come to be
recognised as the authority as to who is
royal, and eligible for royal marriage, and
who is not. So it disqualifies the descend-
ants of Roderick O’Gonor of Ireland, while
it includes petty German nobodies whose
forebears owned a few square miles of
ground and lived on brigandage. Why this
German document should be held as more
authoritative than Old Moore’s Almanac,
or Poor Richard’s Almanac, or the
Bloody Irish Almanac, or the Old Far-
mer’s Almanac is an open question.
HELPING HIM JUT.
MR. BORER-DE-BORER : “ You know there was
something, you know, I wanted to say to
you, you know, and it's gone quaite out

MISS TIRED-TO-DEATH : “It wasn't ‘Good
night,' was it?"
“Don Q.”: Re Caldwell’s machine gun
(B. 26/11/’l4). I don’t know the weight
of this Australian death-dealer, but if it is
as light as the Lewis gun which the United
States army adopted some time ago, the
holding in reserve of a few thousand of the
weapons for use in tight corners ought to
be worth the consideration of the Allies.
During the scrap in Vera Cruz a few
months back a big Yankee seaman, grow-
ing impatient at the tameness of the pro-
ceedings, seized one of these Lewis guns
in his arms and galloped along the street
pumping lead into everything that got in
the way. The demoralising effect of the
bayonet charge was nothing to it. The only
objection to running amok with a quick-
firer of this type is that it eats up as much
ammunition in half an hour as can be manu-
factured for it in a day, and a gun with-
out ammunition is no goed to any army.
RAISING TROOP.
In mentioning the extra duty on beer in his War Budget, Lloyd-George said that “every half-
pint a man drank he would be contributing to the war.” —London news item.
FIRST BOOZY PERSON : “Lesh pay f'r anusher sol-jah.”
SECOND DITTO: “ Nonshensh. Don ’ lesh be mean at a time like thish. Lesh raish

“Man-o’-War Steps”: What a coldly
respectable person the modern bluejacket is !
I met the type the other morning promenad-
ing down George-street, Sydney, with a
severe-looking lady who was obviously his
lawful-wedded wife. He himself wore the
aspect of the Sunday-morning churchgoer.
And he was a fair sample of the elderly men
of the fleet one sees about the streets. The
younger men drink occasionally, but no
harder than the suburbanite on his weekly
or monthly night-out; more often they are
discovered in newsagents’ shops selecting
picture-postcards to send to “the young
ladies they are engaged to.” This change
has come over the fleet since Australia did
the fair thing and undertook its own defence,
instead of hanging on to the blue skirts of
Britannia by hiring a few old pots and pans
for a miserable £200,000 a year. The
Imperial service man who had to leave his
wife on the other side of the world, because
he couldn’t afford to keep her comfortably
in Australia on his moderate Imperial pay,
was practically encouraged to adopt riot and
bachelor revelry as a shore pastime. Now
the sailor’s “doxy” only gets an occasional
airing on a blue serge arm, the limb being
mostly monopolised by a nice girl or a
married lady who will Stand No Nonsense.
There is material for two sermons and a
moral comic opera in Our Navy.
* * * *
“Solomon Malaprop” : I see that “epileptic
insanity” is mentioned as a defence in a
rather notorious case. I once, in my
stormy younger days, tried a plea of
“apoplectic impecuniosity.” I forget the
result.
* * * *
What a mad, weird thing civilisation is !
While thousands of valuable white men are
being buried in nameless graves or trenches
in one part of the world, in another the
best resources of the law are detailed to
elucidate the death of a casual and unvalu-
able Chow, of uncertain age and similar
habits. The Chow is, or was, Him Fung,
of Lilly Buck-stleet, Melbun, whose remains
were discovered under a pile of rubbish on
a lonely part of Fisherman’s Bend, near the
mouth of the Yarra. The only fact so far
scratched up is that Him died from wounds
in the lower part of the stomach. Apparently
he had been run over by a vehicle of some
sort; and the theory is that he was one of
an opium-smuggling party, and either fell
or was pushed out of the vehicle before the
expedition had reached its proper conclu-
sion, and being then somewhat in the way
was removed and planted so that the busi-
ness in hand might be carried out as per
plan.
Nothing ever happened but somebody
found out that Daniel had predicted it. A
Jewish-Englishman, writing in the Melbourne
Herald, says that the Kaiser’s downfall is
foretold in the 11th Chapter of the Book.
Out of the fog the Bull-Moses ex-
tracts references to the Kais r and his
sons, to Belgium and the rest of the Allies.
to Austria, likewise to
German militarism and
arrogance, not to men-
tion neutrality and
“the Crown Prince
especially.” It is as
clear to the meanest
understanding as the
connection between
iEsop’s Fables and the
occurrence of red rust
in a wheat crop at
Nevertire; nevertheless
it satisfied Jewish
Englishman that
Daniel had his eye on
William the Hun when
he w,as talking of Dar-
ius the Mede. “Even
the duration of the
war,” says Daniel’s
latest interpreter,
seems to be indicated
in the 11th and 12th
verses of the 12th
Chapter.”" This dis-
covery makes the heart
of The Bulletin sad,
since the verses imply
that the Kaiser will be'
desolating Europe for
1290 days, and that
peace will not be
declared for 45 days
after the armistice. If
however, the trouble
should be still going strong 3i years after
the date of the German attack at Liege, The
Bulletin may begin to think that Daniel
knew something.
* * * #
The other day, if the cable speaks sooth,
there were assembled in one tent not far
from the Belgian fighting line the King of
Great Britain, the King of the Belgians,
the President of France, the French
Gommander-in-Chief, the British Commander
and the British Minister for War. And no
German air-shark dropped a bomb on the
outfit. These are the chances which never
recur. In Napoleon’s campaign of 1813—
the one which ended at Leipsic the
Austrian general Schwartzenberg was
fighting a desperate rearguard action against
the French, and in the scuffle the
Emperors of Austria and Russia and the
King of Prussia, who were inspecting
operations, were left behind by accident on
a hill. A hundred soldiers could have taken
them, but they sat down behind a herb,
and General Vandamme, for lack ot
information, passed on —to strike utter ruin
when Schwartzenberg got his second wind.
Fortune knocks at the door once. It it
doesn’t open she passes on and leaves her
unmarried daughter sitting on the doorstep.

A quaint recent advt. in a London paper
set forth that the advertiser was willing to
adopt a Belgian orphan —“Must have
hands.” Yet, after all, it is the Belgian
orphan whose hands have been cut off by
some Prussian beast who most requires
to be adopted by a kind and stodgy family
at Peckliam Rye.

The while her chop is grilling ;
And gurgle in his winning way :
“I trust that you enjoyed the play?”

Then Johnson reads about the war,
Of butchery and panic,
Of sieges, fights, the dreadful roar
Of cannonades satanic.

John Tweed, maker of the statue of
Captain Cook which Andrew Stenhouse has
given to St. Kilda (Vic.), proves that
flowing curls, a velvet coat and a shabby
home are non-essentials in the real artist.
He is tall, dark-moustached and good-look-
ing, carefully groomed and dressed, and lives
in one of the beautiful old houses along the
Chelsea Embankment- —a quarter which has
probably housed as many famous men as
any part of London. When Tweed, now
verging on 40, was very young, Rhodes
saw and admired his work, and a great
deal of it is in South Africa, including a
“colossal” statue of Rhodes himself. His
studio is a kind of resting place for minor
royalties and people of the sort. There
are so far only two editions of the St.
Kilda statue, the other being at Whitby,
Cook’s birthplace in Yorkshire. The Cook
statue recently unveiled in London is not
by Tweed, but by Brock —inventor of that
bride-cake decoration which faces Bucking-
ham Palace and is called the Queen Victoria
Memorial.
COMFORTING.
THE CHEERFUL GIRL: "I'm so glad you're
going, Charlie; I think it perfectly lovely
to die for 'one's country."
The will of Alfred Stokes, who years ago
represented Forbes in the N.S.W. Assembly,
has been proved at a little over a quarter
of a million. The estate is not to be real-
ised for 21 years, the income meantime
going to four sons and a daughter. Prac-
tically all the wealth came from the old
Forbes goldfield, where Stokes’s first deal
was in potatoes. There was not a spud on
the diggings. Stokes heard that there were
some on the road. He rode out to meet the
teams, bought the lot, and doubled his money
before nightfall.
Prince von Billow, who has been sent as
German Ambassador to Rome, has a cosmo-
politan reputation for charm of manner, and
so on. He is still remarkably good looking,
and he is regarded as a fine musician in a
country of musicians. Hardly anyone else
could have achieved the position he has,
taking all the circumstances into considera-
tion. He is the Charles Dilke of Germany.
As a young man he was attached to the
German Embassy at Rome. His chief’s wife
was young and beautiful. Von Biilow ran
away with her and, after the divorce,
married her. Within a year they were
moving in Berlin society once more, and
within another year he had been offered and
had accepted a diplomatic position of con-
sequence.
John B. Whitty, formerly of Lewis and
Whitty, has died at Beechworth (Vic.),
aged 78. The partners began to make
blacking in a small way in a by-street in
Fitzroy something over 40 years ago. The
tariff helped them along, until now there
probably isn’t a kitchen and laundry in the
Commonwealth that doesn’t take in some
article of Lewis and Whitty manufacture.
Barrister Maxwell, who was one of many
Liberal candidates for the Evelyn (Vic.)
State seat, made a cheerful admission dur-
ing the fight. Speaking against preference
to unionists, he said: “The men who defend
this preference are as guilty as the men I
defend every day.” .Somebody asked the
candidate to explain why he defended the
guilty, and so helped injustice; but the real
point is that, supposing preference to be as
wicked as Maxwell’s most murderous client,
the man who defends it is even then as good
anyhow as Maxwell is himself. And Max-
well hasn’t a poor opinion of his own
goodness.
There is a lot of fighting blood in Colonel
Ilyrie, of the House of Reps., who was
banqueted by his brother members before
leaving for the big trouble with the Light
Horse. His grandfather, Stewart Ryrie,
was a Commissariat officer during the
Peninsular War, and fed the army at
Waterloo. The ,Colonel’s mother was a
daughter of Lieutenant Faunce, Adjutant
of the 4th Regiment, stationed in Sydney
in the first 'thirties; and her mother was a
daughter of Kenneth Mackenzie, Colonel of
the regiment at the same time. Adjutant
Fa mice's father was a general in the army,
and an aide to the King. Commissariat-
officer Stewart Ryrie’s first wife was a sister
of General Stewart, of the 3rd Buffs, who
was acting-Governor of N. S. Wales for If)
days in December, 1825. When the General
entered upon his job he found a crowd of
men lying under sentence of death. lie

Chief Justice Way is to have a statue —
bronze, no doubt—erected to his honor in
the grounds of the Adelaide University, of

Not unlikely the monument will appear
during the Baronet’s lifetime, for the money
has already been subscribed.
Died last week, Daniel Whelan, one of
the oldest lightkeepers on the Australian
coast. He was in Green Cape lighthouse
(N.S.W.) early in 1886, when the Ly-ee-
moon crashed on the rocks. The vessel broke
in halves and the fore part drifted near
enough in-shore for keeper Whelan to get a
line aboard. By this means many of the
passengers were saved ; yet the lightkeepers
buried 80 of the drowned in the “Ly-ee-
moon” cemetery, hurriedly laid out near by.
For his conduct on the occasion of that
disaster Whelan received several rewards
from the Humane and kindred societies.
Barrister Herbert Angas Parsons, who is
to “take silk” at an early date, is the most
charming speaker in the South Aus. Parlia-
ment. Ilis father, the late John Langdon
Parsons, was the most delightful orator of
his day in Adelaide. Angas Parsons is a
descendant of George Fife Angas, “founder”
of South Aus., and has inherited some of
the Angas family wealth. He is a partner
of Paddy Glynn, K.C., son-in-law of Slang-
don Bonython, proprietor of the Adver-
tiser ; a leader of the outer Bar; president
of all sorts of institutions running for the
good of the community, and aged 42.
THE RAISER'S PREMATURE MEDAL.
Small medallions bearing a portrait of the Kaiser and an inscription describing him as “King of Eng-
land,” taken from dead Germans after the battle of Mons, have been exhibited by wounded British
soldiers at Bishop Stortford, says the Hertfordshire Mercury.
The Kaiser as Kins; of England occupies one side of the medallion. ’The other side is
invented to show that the coin will serve any emeigency.
Anglican Bishop Barlow, of Goal burn
(N.S.W.), who has resigned his apron and
gaiters on the ground of ill-health, was the
first “colonial” clergyman to be made a
bishop in Australia.
Henry Carey Hangar, “father” of the
N.S.W. Leg. Council, has obtained leave of
absence for the remainder of the session
on the ground of ill-health. He is in his
85th year; and has been 40 years in politics
—in a sort of way. The runners-up in the
Council are Henry Moses and Dr. Creed,
nominated by Alexander Stuart in 1885.
Moses was in the Leg. Ass. in 1860, and is
the oldest parliamentarian in harness. Dr.
Creed was elected in 1872.
A. M. Betts, the 70-year-old Mayor of Goul-
burn (N.S.W. ), and a solicitor since 1866, has
accepted an invitation from the Auckland
Anglicans to be their guest at the approach-
ing Marsden Centenary in Maoriland. On
Christmas Day, 100 years ago, Marsden
visited those parts and preached to the
Maoris in English, on the text, “Behold, I
bring you glad tidings of great joy,” the
sermon being explained afterwards by a
native who had vegetated in N. S. Wales.
The Goulburn man is a grandson of parson
Marsden. Each of Marsden’s girls—Anne
Elizabeth, Mary and Martha- —had 1280 acres
of land granted to her as “clergyman’s
daughters.” Mary married John Betts, of
Parramatta, and A. M. Betts was their son;
Martha married Josiah Betts, of Hassan’s
Walls and Itegentville. Mary’s land grant
was at Vale Head, Molong. The home-
stead still in the possession of the Betts
family, was at one time an inn kept by
Charles Henry Cobden, brother of the Eng-
lish Freetrade crank and corn-law agitator.
“Jeames’s” pickings:—
The new Earl of Erne was one of the first
British prisoners captured in the war. A Sydney
paper said, apropos his accession to the title, last
week, that “he is noted as one of the handsomest
members of London Society.” The fact is he re-
sembles a Caran d’Ache caricature of an English
nobleman. He is middle-aged, tall, very bald, fair,
nronocled and with an expression of countenance
which suggests boredom and over-whelming arro-
gance, but is really only an indication of vacuity.
The thing he is most noted for is his foot. It is
about the biggest in England. Two of the hand-
somest men in Society have just been killed—young
Wyndham (only son of George Wyndham and the
Countess Grosvenor) and Captain Banbury (only son
of the baronet-M.P.). Banbury—tall, dark, fine-fea-
tured, slim and with the waist of a girl—was the
sort of Guardsman “Ouida” depicted. He was a
well-known steeplechasirg figure, and rode the winner
of a Grand Military at Sandown a few years ago.
The limelight has fallen on Dr. Scheidel,
manager of the Portland (N.S.W.) Cement
Company. His tactlessness in allowing
himself to be appointed employers’ represen-
tative on a wages board was typically Teu-
tonic, and gave rise to questions in the
Assembly by Colonel Onslow, and to letters
of protest in the papers. Scheidel was in
England when the war broke out. He says
he tendered his resignation to his directors,
and that they handed it back with the inti-
mation that he was regarded as so poor a
German that he might be relied on to
advance the fortunes of a British trading
concern. The directors didn’t put it in
those words, of course, but the effect was
the same. And so he returned and resumed
the helm at Portland. He visited Germany
on the same trip, but is silent as to what
his fellow-countrymen said to him. Prob-
ably they remarked that any German who
controlled a cement business in an enemy
country was good enough for them.
Francis Conway Mason, ex-Spealter of
Victoria, whose appearance would have
entitled him to be executed in error as
Charles I. had he been around Whitehall
250 years, ago, has just been reminded of
old times in the Legislative Assembly by
being appointed “official visitor” to Mel-
bourne lunatic asylums.
There is an elusive sort of element about
parsons. The well-advertised Yarrington,
of Sydney, was one who contributed to the
Song of the Three Holy Children about a
certain pub (no address given) where boys
pervaded the place in a fearsome state of
grog. Then he discoursed greatly on
opium dens (again no address given). And
last week two motor drivers sued the
reverend for £7 each for hire of vehicles
on Federal election day. They said he had
fixed a time for payment, but, like the
public-house that was full of drunken
infants and the unfindable opium den, he
failed to materialise. A cold, hard
magistrate made an order against the
scarce or invisible preacher with the
alternative of two months in his Majesty’s
skilly palace.
THE BEAR'S XMAS DINNER.
As foreseen by the office prophet.
If the recent Victorian elections did
nothing else they at least revived interest in
one unsuspected ancient —Michael Tuohey,
who, almost 60 years ago, was one of
Peter Lalor’s lieutenants at the Eureka
skirmish. Michael was captured on that
occasion, but was afterwards acquitted.
He got into the limelight once more, and
the hospital, through indulging in an argu-
ment about the candidates for ex-M.L.A.
Holden’s vacated seat at Warrenheip—
Clarke (Lib.) and Hogan (Labor). As
the “ex-rebel” is 84, a broken ankle and
severe shock don’t improve his chances of
reaching a ripe old age.
SYDNEY FLAPPER, MELBOURNE PEACH!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The best advice that can be given to song-writers
eager to produce a marching song for our Australian
troops is—Don't forget the Girl !
—Sydney Telegraph.
I loved a nice girl in the backblocks,
Another I loved in town ;
There was one that I ought to have married,
And another who turned me down.
But now that I’ve gone and enlisted,
And I'm far from women and wine,
I like to remember their kisses,
And I hope they'll remember mine!
Sydney flapper, Melbourne peach,
Surfing maid on Manly beach,
Tart who used for me to wait
At the lamp-post, five past eight;
Outbade girl upon a farm
(Left her—never meant no harm!),
Girl who didn’t trust the men,
Tom who must be in by ten,
Girl I meant to make my wife,
Girl I wouldn’t —on my life!
All I ask of you is this;
Vqii’t forget my good-bye kits!
There's a chap—for a girl we were rivals—
But he didn’t enlist, the cow !
She chucked him for me in my khaki—
But I bet she is kissing him now !
My troubles! as long as there’s others !
And one of the bunch will be true:
There’s only one girl in Australia—
Yes, Kiddie, I’m thinking of you 1
Each chap for his Kiddie is fighting;
And that is the reason we'll win.
So, Kiddie, I’m wanting your letters—
You'd better address ’em “Berlin”!
Go slow on the other chaps, Kiddie,
Just wait till I get my V.C.
But I swear from the last night you kissed me
One girl has got tickets on me !

This Company is being formed for the purpose of acquiring the KHEDIVE TOBACCO PROPRIETARY KIMITED, who possess a valuable secret for
improving’ Australian-grown Tobacco Leaf in its manufacture, thereby imparting to it the main characteristics of the well-known \ lrgiman .Leaf,
which has such an enormous sale. , . , . , _ , A , .
For the purpose of co-operating with the AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO FARMER m making a lucrative market tor his crop.
For the purpose of encouraging the improvement of the quality of AUSTRALIAN-GROWN LEAF. nmDWTrrv
For the purpose of demonstrating to AUSTRALIANS that an excellent article, whether it be a PIPE TOBACCO, a CIGARETTE, 01 a CIGAR, can
he made of AIJSTRALLVX-GROWN inanufactuiecl in AUSTRALIA, under AUSTRALIAN CONDITIONS, by AUSTRALIANS, and incidentally
to encourage AUSTRALIANS to smoke it.
For the purpose of vastly reducing to the consumer the COST of a luxury which has become a necessity. . , . .. . . f
The spacious factory of the Vendor Company, which has become notable for the phenomenal strides it has made, particulailj in its output ot
The Well-known “LUBA” Tobacco
is equipped with a complete, up-to-date plant. The secret process which lias already been mentioned, has enabled the Company to produce Tobacco
which is the equal in every way to any quality now on the market, at greatly reduced price to the public. A special line is a working man s Tobacco,
flake cut, in tins, at 6d. per tin, wiiich has, under the name of “LUBA,” thoroughly caught the popular fancy.
Samples of . the Tobacco manufactured under the process may be seen and
tried at 9 Jones Lane, off Lonsdale Street, Melbourne.
The new Company will acquire, w r ith the Khedive Tobacco Proprietary Lim-
ited, the contract which binds the manufacturer to the Vendors for a period of
10 years. This gentleman has had a world-wide experience in the manufacture
of Tobacco, and is the inventor of many appliances now in great vogue in some of
the world’s largest factories, and incidentally the discoverer of the secret process
referred to.
When it is realised that over £500,000 is made as net profit annually by
factors and manufacturers of tobacco in Australia alone, the great opportunity
to make a handsome profit for the shareholders in this new Company must be
apparent, since it operates under the following favorable conditions
(a) The supply of a working man’s Tobacco, packed in beautiful tins,
flake cut, and sold for 6d. to the public.
(&) No import duty on Australian-grown Leaf, which is in itself a fine
margin of profit.
(c) The ability to manufacture tobacconists’ own brands at reduced
prices, giving retailers a greater benefit.
( d ) The actual experience, on which the figures quoted below are based,
on present capacity, shows a net annual profit of 25 per cent, on the
total nominal capital.
(e) The intention of the Company to further encourage the sale of its
Tobacco by launching a GENEROUS CO-OPERATIVE SCHEME,
by which the retailer will share in the net profits to the extent of
10 per cent., which will be distributed annually amongst the trade
as a bonus.
The following is a carefully-checked estimate of the whole cost of production
of tobacco under the new process by the Khedive Tobacco Proprietary Limited :
DR. —To ISO tons prepared tobacco per annum, including
labor, material, ingredients, boxes, labels, show-cards,
excise, etc., at £BOB/16/- . . . . • . . .£55.584 0 0
Management, travellers, etc. . . . . . . . . 1,800 0 0
Advertising . . . . • • • • • • • • • • 1,000 0 0
CR. —180 tons prepared Tobacco per annum, sold to trade
at average price of £4Ol per ton . .£72,180 0 0
Balance, Net Profit . . 13,70(5 0 0
£72,180 0 0 £72,180 0 0
When it is known that there is no need whatever to import tobacco in any
form into Australia, a glance at the official figures supplied below is positively
appalling:—
Unmanufactured Leaf imported last year
from all countries, principally the United
States of America .. .. ..15,805,4421b., value £701256
Manufactured Tobacco imported last year
from all countries, principally the United
States of America . . . . . . . . 1,442,9711 b., value £108.388
Total 17,249,4131 b., value £809,674
Australia can produce the whole of this, and it is only a matter of constant
culture to ensure the highest quality.
The public and press of Australia are now proclaiming the opportunity to
exploit Australian industries. This Company will allot parcels of shares, how-
ever small, to enable every Australian to participate in the profits of this Aus-
tralian enterprise.
FURTHER EXPLANATION OF OBJECTS.
No. 1. To take over as a going concern the business now carried on at
No. 9 Jones Lane, off Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, in the State of Victoria,
bv Khedive Tobacco Proprietary Limited, under the style or Arm of
“Khedive Tobacco Proprietary Limited,” and all the assets and liabilities of
the proprietor of that business in connection therewith, and, with a view
thereto, to adopt the agreement referred to in Clause 3 of the Company’s
Articles of Association, and to carry the same into effect with or without
modification.
No. 3. To carry on the business of Manufacturers of and Dealers in
Tobacco, Cigars, Cigarettes, Matchlights, Pipes, and any other articles
required by or which may be convenient to smokers, and of snuff grinders
and merchants, and to carry on the business of hairdressers, and buyers,
sellers, manufacturers, importers, exporters and dealers of or in tobacco,
cigars, cigarettes, snuff, pipes, matches, fusees, lights, walking-sticks,
umbrellas, tins, canisters, cardboard and other boxes, hair and other
brushes, combs, razors, scissors, soap, sponges and other toilet requisites,
newspapers, periodicals, magazines, playing cards and fancy goods, and any
other articles commonly dealt in by Tobacconists.
No. 5. To develop, manage, improve, farm, and assist in developing,
managing, improving or farming any landed or other property belonging
to the Company, or in which the Company is interested, and for that
purpose to grant, and agree to grant, leases of every description, and to
make advances and to enter into guarantees, and generally to make such
arrangements as the Directors may consider expedient.
THE LEADING WHOLESALE BUYING HOUSES of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia have placed large hulk orders for the popular “LUBA”
TOBACCO. As an example, a few daps ago 10,000 tins were sent to Adelaide, 10,000 tins to Sydney.
THE NEW TARIFF TABLED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THURSDAY, hi/ the Prime Minister, places this Australian Company in the
happy position of being very much better protected by increased Customs duty than formerly, both as regards manufactured and unmanufactured' tobacco. This
substantially increases the value of investment in the new Company, and gives a substantial advantage over all tobacco imported or made from imported leaf.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The miserably prodigal State Government
of N.S.W., which wails about its misfortunes
as if it and not the Australian Government
was carrying the war burden, has been hav-
ing quite a good time, though it doesn’t seem
to be aware of the fact. During the first five
months of the present financial year the
revenue has been £213,982 more than it was
for the corresponding five months of last
year. The revenue has kept expanding
steadily ever since the great trouble started,
and it is establishing another record in the
State’s history. But the Holman push
(though it has no war expenditure to pro-
vide for, and though it gets its Federal sub-
sidy of 255. per inhabitant per annum
whether times are good or bad. so that it is
in no way affected by any decline in the Cus-
toms and Excise revenue) has contrived to
increase the expenditure by £310.335. or at
the rate of over £60,000 per month. So the
outgoings are fully £900.000 ahead of the
income, and the deficit is nearly £lOO,OOO
worse than it was at this date last year.
These are supposed to be times of economy,
when people make some, small sacrifices for
Hie defence of the Empire, but Holman’s
idea is always to keep expenditure well
ahead, and whenever he gets £2 in extra in-
come he “blews” £3 in extra outgoings, and
poses by reason of his liberality as the
friend of the worker. So despite all his
new imposts he is nearer the verge of the
precipice than he was a year ago. There
seems to be no cure for Holman, except obli-
teration. The craving to purchase popu-
larity at the expense of posterity is a disease
that can only be remedied with an axe.
’Sh all right—fill ’em up again! Scad-
dan’s revenue in Westralia for November
was £369,225, and his ’spenditure £453.379.
That is to say, for everj’ 20s. he received
lie spent 255.; which means that this genera-
tion paid the policeman’s wages for about
54 days in the week and then forged the
baby’s name to an lOU for the other 14
days. For the expired five months of the
financial year the revenue was £1.821.218
and the expenditure £2,211,863. so the total
drift towards perdition in 21 weeks was
£390,645. And to make it ouite clear that
he regards himself as recommissioned by the
country to drift into debt for the police-
man’s wages and such-like odds and ends,
Scaddan shows that the receipts last month
increased by £5OOO. while the expenditure
was pushed up by no less than £27.000.

That margin of £71,324 between profit and
dividend is wide; and it is quite likely
that a fairly-wide margin will be needed.
It isn’t possible to guess what profit this
bank will lose in exchange alone this current
half-year; but put the earnings at £40,000
less than the recent average, and you are
probably within the mark. There may
be losses to provide for also in connection
with money advanced to the foreigner on
goods carried in foreign bottoms; but the
chairman told the shareholders that he
didn’t expect the total would be “material.”
This seems to be borne out by the profit
disclosed for the six months. The man-
agement should by this time have a pretty
good idea of its probable losses, on account
of both the war and the drought; and if
it expected them to be serious, it would
surely have put some of that £71,324 of
surplus profit up its sleeve. The profit
actually disclosed is under £5OOO less than
that for the corresponding part of 1912-13;
and this seems to be the best of tips that.
s-> far as the management can see, all
reasonable contingencies have been pro-
vided for, and that the current half-year’s
disclosed profits won’t bump hard enough
to take anybody’s breath away.
And, after all. there don’t seem to he any
terrible contingencies to lie provided for.
The wool clip is mostly hung up. and lower
prices will have to be accepted. That is
had. but it would be infinitely worse if a
drought had robbed tis of 25,000.000 sheep.
That would mean a serious loss of capital
and earning power. As it is. the flocks arc
almost unaffected; for though we have had
a drought lately, it was mostly a wheat-
growers’ drought, due to a dry winter and
spring, and it takes also a dry summer
(which we haven’t had) to flatten out the
pastoral country. In (lie early ’nineties
there was a slump in the markets and a
had drought: hut even those two things com-
ing together were not sufficient to cause the
leg financial trouble of those years. The curse
of those times was that hanks and mort-
gage cos. couldn’t see their customers
through. They were being themselves
pressed, and they had to squeeze in return.
This time nobody dreams of squeezing the
banks, whose position is so remarkable that
without turning a hair they can even under-
take to lend £10,000.000 or £12,000,000 in
gold to the Commonwealth. This B.N.S.W.
had on Sept. 30 £30,722,127 on deposit. Its
liquid assets were no less than £21,779,989
—coin, bullion and immediately convertible
securities. There is consequently no
need and apparently no thought on
the bank’s part of squeezing the
customer who is making an effort to pull
through. The Bulletin hears from
N.S.W. country districts of a few fore-
closures, and some correspondents have
urged a moratorium in consequence. But
the mortgagees in such cases are private
lenders. If there are any serious number
of such foreclosures the position ought cer-
tainly to be considered by the Government.
Meantime this paper proposes, seconds and
carries unanimously a motion recognising
the national services rendered by this and
other Australian banks in standing to
country customers and giving them a
chance to win through. If the wool-market
situation gradually eases, as it promises to
do, and if the next wheat harvest is even
fair, the banks will be eased of their extra
load. Meantime they can carry it comfort-
ably. In fact, if Bloody Bill had consented
to postpone his plan for butchering his
Empire till the Australian banks were quite
ready, he couldn’t have made a better choice
of time for carrying out the contract.

Even though the disclosed profits are £7OOO
less than they were in 1913 and £lO.OOO less
than in 1912 (when some contingency funds
were supposed to have been brought to light),
the co. has nothing to complain about. Making
a liberal cut off the £40,520 to add to the
unearned-premium reserve, the profit would
still be much in excess of 20 p.c. on the capi-
tal ; and half that capital has been provided
out of reserves during the past four years.
Altogether the co. has had an amazingly
prosperous seven years or so; in the last
three years alone it has made just upon
twice the total amount of the capital put into
the business. Of course, there has been first-
class management—a far-seeing management,
too, which didn’t hesitate to make an appeal
for Australian business on the ground that
the Queensland was an Australian co. But
there has been a certain amount of luck as
well. Anyhow, the co. had the good fortune
to be hatched into the world in the nest of
Burns, Philp and Co.; and few Australian
cos. have enjoyed a greater maiia than that
one. So the Queensland passed safely
through those early years which are fatal
to many fire and marine insurance cos. Yet,
with all its advantages, it was 15 years
before it was able to rake together £40,000
of reserves of all sorts, and in spite of almost
painful moderation in the matter of divi-
dends during that period. Then, as usual
with these cos., success, when it came, bred
success in such abundance that you could
almost swear it must be a pest of some sort.
This shows some of it:—•

Parliament also has helped. Laws relating
to workmen’s compensation and such like
have been enforced, and these have added to
tlie pile of premiums. Generally speaking,
also, this business has brought the expense
rate down. Employers’ liability business, for
instance, comes in, as a rule, in nice large
lumps.
Except that the premiums have gone on
growing, the past year’s figures are poorer
than usual of late. In the first place, fires
have been numerous. Droughts and other
adverse conditions notoriously increase the
inflammability of insured property. Hard
conditions in the country must also have in-
creased the cost of getting business. So far
as the war is concerned, these figures are
probably not much auected by it. As things
turned out, there ought to have been some
profit in the war risks taken at high rates in
August; but one would judge it likely that
that profit is held in suspense in view of the
risks still current. For this year the co.
will do surprisingly well if it shows anything
like the same figures. Fire losses threaten
to be larger; marine and employers’ liability
premiums threaten to be considerably
smaller. However, things would have to get
far worse than they are likely to get before
the shareholders’ 121 p.c. would be in danger.
Last year interest and rents supplied all
but £4149 of the dividend : and as about two-
thirds of the investments are public securi-
ties and bank deposits, the war tends rather
to improve the earnings from this source
than otherwise. The other third of the in-
vestments consists of freehold, which appears
to have been well bought. There are no
mortgages; apart from the freeholds, all the
assets are liquid. The co. which can make
an average of even 20 p.c. and still hold its
principal like that must surely reckon this a
very good world in spite of the fact that
William the Swollenhead is still in it.

In the beginning there were Henry Jones
and A. W. Palfreyman and an idle jam fac-
tory at Hobart. Jones and Palfreyman
scraped together a few pounds and made the
idle factory busy. Then, having almost col-
lared the Tasmanian trade, they got interests
elsewhere; and after that they witnessed
the distressing spectacle of businesses in
which they were interested fighting one
another for raw material, and wasting money
to get custom. They were much too keen
to put up with that; and this co. was the
result. It was formed, not to buy up the
various businesses, but to invest in the
shares of the cos. which owned those busi-
nesses. The various businesses still have
their independent existence. There are
Henry Jones and Co., Ltd., of Tasmania;
and the Australian Jam Co., Ltd., of Mel-
bourne; and H. Jones and Co. (Sydney),
Ltd.; and Hoadley’s Proprietary, Ltd., in
Melbourne; and the Peacock Jam Co., Ltd-
in Sydney—in all these and perhaps others
the co. has either a controlling or large
interest. In fact, it usually owns all the
shares. The effect is that, while the separ-
ate cos. maintain their identity, there isn’t,
nominally, any combine. On the other hand,
all the good results of co-operation are
secured by the fact that the directors of this
co. control the subsidiary cos.
Now and then a curse is heaved at
the co. for being a combine, and the majority
of a Commonwealth Commission lately found
that Jones’s operations in connection with
the fruit-export business of Tasmania were
no good to the producer who wanted to be
independent. It is fairly obvious, also, that
the management itself has been a bit nervous
of the law relating to trade combinations.
Still, every co-operative concern, if it does
any good at all, is only going to do it
through cutting down the pay or profit of
somebody, and there is no crime in that.
This particular concern may give the grower
less than he sometimes thinks he ought to
have. He may actually get less than he
might sometimes get if the subsidiary cos.
were all chasing him to buy. But by cut-
ting out waste, as it unquestionably has
done, and by pushing markets abroad, it is
certain that this one co. can afford in the
long run not only to pay the fruit-growers
more, but also to supply either a better or
a cheaper article.
It doesn’t follow, of course, that the pro-
ducers or the consumers actually get better
treatment because the combination can
afford to give it to them. Pretty often a
combination wants to collar the savings for
itself. In this case* it can at least be said
that the dividend has been kept exceedingly
moderate. Certainly the profits disclosed
last year were sufficient to pay 10 p.c. And
that may not be all. As before remarked,
this co. nominally owns no factories: it
only owns shares in factories. Consequently
it shows its income, not as profit on manu-
facture. but as dividends from investments.
The accounts of the subsidiary cos. are not
published; and those cos. may be either
dividing every possible penny or banking up
reserves wholesale. If they are banking up
reserves, of course they are simply adding to
the hidden profits and reserves of this co.
What (he investor may want to know is
“What security is there for my money?”
The accounts show 20s. in the £, phis about
2s. per share for reserves. But it doesn’t
follow that there are tangible assets for the
lot. For instance, at the start, when the
.capital was £400,000 (it is now £550.000).
the tangible assets were reckoned at about
£308,500. That meant £91.500 of paper or
goodwill: and there has probably been some
in subsequent purchases. However, it isn’t
much use considering what the tangible
assets are worth in a case of this kind. If
things get so bad that they have to be
realised, factory plant and tools and build-
ings don’t usually fetch much. You have
to look at this thing mainly as a going con-
cern : and in view of its good margin of
profit, the fact that its products are every-
day lines, and its very capable management,
there probably are few more solid. The
co.. besides its Australian connection, has
financed a factory in S’Africa and at latest
it was considering California.

There’s not too cheerful a time immediately
ahead of this concern, either. So far this
season a mere handful of wool has been sold
in Sydney; and the prohibition against
export is so comprehensive that even (lie
Japanese ally has only been permitted to get
his few bales by convincing the Government
that the stuff, raw or woven, wouldn’t go
past Japan. Now and then there have been
small spurts in the English market; and to
be on the soot a fair number of growers who
usually sell in Australia are shipping to
London. Others are holding on here, and
stacking at the station, the scours or in the
Sydney stores. There is no profit in all
this for people like Harrison, Jones and
Devlin. If wool is shipped unsold it means
a dead loss to them ; if it is held and sold
here in driblets at low prices it means big
overhead and miscellaneous charges, and
poor commission earnings to pay them with.
The position as to some other lines is even
worse than as to wool —ask, for instance, the
poor beggar who denends more or less on
rabbit-skins.
Fortunately the co. recognised that it had
too big a load of interest to carry comfort-
ably in bad times. Ilence the old mortgage'
has been worked down; and for some lucky
reason or other advances were reduced so
much during the past year that the co.’s
“other debts” fell from £126,328 to
£66,900: —-

But even £153,733 is a solid lot to he
owing. The nature of the security is of
course not mentioned, It may be pastoral
property or it may be wool and produce sent
for sale. There certainly is no reason why
a pastoral co. should lose money on either
of these classes of security; yet, somehow,
the experience of such cos. in advancing on
pastoral property has often been bitter.
What this co.’s £153,733 would be like if
you cut it up The Bulletin doesn’t know.
It is the thing you have to chance. For the
rest there are these comfortable facts: (1)
in 10 years the profits have totalled
£170,784, and only £86,000 of it has been
taken out of the business, the balance going
either to write down assets or increase
visible reserves; (2) it hasn’t been thought
necessary to write down any assets for six
years past, though there have been ample
surplus profits for the purpose if it had been
thought necessary; and (3) there was a
margin of £5198 of profit in excess of the
dividend last year, and there is a reserve
(though not in cash) of £lO,OOO for equalis-
ing dividends. On the other hand, the
steady shrinkage of profits during the past
four years isn’t calculated to make one rush
these shares with much enthusiasm. Of
course store wages, etc., have been rising;
but other cos. in this business have been
under the same handicap and still haven’t
shown the same unpleasant drift.

Faith, besides moving mountains, sometimes
pays big dividends. This co. had faith.
It believed that Victoria, though very sick
after the big boom, would “come back” and
recover its punch. So, besides nursing its
own assets as far as possible, it bought the
assets of various other Vic. building societies,
convinced that prices would steadily recover,
whereupon it would be able to sell out at a
profit. Thus inspired it has bought the
corpses of the Lygon Permanent, South
Melbourne, City of Prahran, Premier,
Planet. Economic and Melbourne Perman-
ent, and it is kept busy selling off their
assets, mostly on time payment, and in
making advances, largely to people to build
on land sold to them. Naturally, having had
all these wholesale transactions, its figures
have changed considerably :

First, as to shareholders —(1) What is their
security like? (2) What are their profit
prospects? The worst feature is the very
large increase in advances, etc., during the
year. It is the comparatively new advance,
from which little has been whittled by repay-
ments, that is most liable to cause trouble in
a slump. If a security is thrown back on
to a mortgagee’s hands after the mortgagor
has been paying instalments for two or three
years, it doesn’t matter much, for there isn’t
likely to be serious loss of principal when
the thing is sold. But it is very different
when the advances are new. Certainly dur-
ing the past year values have not been
generally booming in Melbourne, so the large
aggregate of advances made by this co. may
have been on a moderate basis. Otherwise
the co. might easily have laid the foundation
for serious losses. No doubt it will use every
effort to keep the present people in possession,
so long as they show any inclination to do a
fair thing. Its ability to adopt this plan
thoroughly depends on whether its own
■depositors want their money or not. De-
posits now amount to £3(38,1)20; total liabili-
ties. including mortgages, etc.. £435,809. The
assets are £047,452 —practically 30s. for
every £1 owed by the co. But, though that
would be satisfactory enough, assuming a
fair valuation of assets, the position is still
better, seeing that only a poor little £23,077
of the lot consists of miscellaneous and fore-
closed properties. The only two properties
held of any consequence are in Collins-street,
and they are valued together at £81.005.

Enough money is wasted each year through faulty
power transmission in many power plants of Aus-
tralia as would comfortably pay the salaries of at
least three State Governors. This waste of good
money (if it goes on in your plant) can be stopped
at little cost —by equipping all your drives with
•Pioneer,” the all-Australian leather belting.
“Pioneer” gives best results under all conditions. It
works in the ore mines of Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie,
the sugar mills of North Queensland and Fiji, in fac-
tories in the Philippines and Japan, and in thousands
of private plants. Let “Pioneer” work for you—it
runs slacker than any other belting, and this g-ives
greater power conveyance with less strain on shaft-
ing and friction on bearings. Every foot of “Pioneer”
is the centre cut of a flawless Australian ox hide.

ROYDS, LTD., Investors’ Advisers, Challis House, Sydney
£542,709, consists of loans on mortgage and
balances due on sales; and, as before ie-
marked. the bulk of this is probably secured
by assets far in excess of the reduced
advances or balances now owing. Ihe
depositors’ position therefore should give not
a moment’s uneasiness. And presuming,
therefore, that the depositor wo.rt disturb
his money, the society will be in a position
to nurse all its securities; and we needn t
have a doubt about the ultimate recovery of
values. Profits may —pretty certainly will
—ease off: but note that if half of them
were clipped oft there would remain enough
to pay the 8 p.c. dividend. *
That distressful concern, the Australian
Motor Cab Co., now the A.M.C. Co., which
has never paid a dividend in its six years,
but has made such losses that half the
capital has been written off, is in more
trouble. The most visible result so far is
the retirement of the manager and secre-
tary; whereupon some amazing stories _ are
told. Presumably the directors —a solicitor,
a barrister and one business man—will call
a meeting at an early date to give share-
holders a chance to carry a vote of confi-
dence in them or otherwise.
The Bulletin lately drew attention to
Hie fact that in 1913 Australia imported
£530,000 worth of tin plate, and this paper
affirmed once more that the country, having
abundance of coke, sheet iron and refined tin,
should tackle the tin-plate industry on its
own account. This matter has now been
brought before Minister for Customs Tudor,
and a request has been made for a bounty.
Almost simultaneously it was asked that
pig iron should be given a bounty of 10s. per
ton. But bounties won’t do. There must
be effective protection for galvanised goods
and hundreds of other secondary or manu-
factured metal products. The yarn that
bounties are preferable to duties springs
from the tariff sinker, who knows quite well
that the Australian bounties on wool tops
and pig iron have failed to do what was ex-
pected of them because the insufficiently pro-
tected weaver and the worker in metal never
got a chance to buy and work up the tops
and the metals.
The Zinc Corporation, which had sold all
its output to Aaron Hirscli and Son, Ger-
man metal dealers, asked Justice Sergeant
in England last week to say whether the
contract, which ordinarily wouldn’t expire
till 1919, was merely suspended, or whether
the war had terminated it. The Judge
remarked that the matter ought to go to the
highest court in the country ; meantime, so
far as he was concerned, the co. mustn’t act
on the assumption that the contract was
terminated. This practically blocks the co.
from going ahead with the scheme in which
it was interested for establishing zinc works
in England.

Great Britain Sluicing (N.S.W.), which
had partly closed down before the war, was
only care-taking in the last three months of
its half-year to the end of October ; and that
ate up £202. Apart from this, however,
there was a loss of £96. The once very pro-
fitable co. has used up its old ground, and is
now back on its third lot of purchased odds
and ends. There would, nevertheless, still
be money in the business had the old rates
of wages and prices for tin prevailed. But the
one have gone up and the other have come
down ; and even though the co. can now find
a local marxet for tin concentrates, it doesn’t
see how it can make ends meet at present,
except by letting tributes.

The market seems to have got a bit
excited over recent developments on the
east_ side of Great Boulder (W.A.). As
previously mentioned here, various makes of
ore have been found in this part of the
property during the last 20 years, and
occasional payable patches have been got;
but the aggregate result has been disappoint-
ing. One or both of the two shoots
recently cut at depth in boring from the
adjoining Perseverance lease, or the lode
recently costeened on the surface in the same
locality, may come to the rescue of what is
officially admitted to be a dying mine; but
nothing but strong faith in things unseen
could justify the present prices.
Magnet (W.A.) is coming on. Besides
being the home of the Empress and Galtee
More, it has under its roof several shows
which have prospects. The Fingall people
have optioned one—the Sirdar—from which
returns up to 40s. per ton have lately been
obtained. Interests in others are being
sought, and the field is now talked of ,as
one with a future. Its permanency at depth
has, however, still to be proved, and this is
a fact of importance that buyers and
intending buyers had , better note.

£22o!* in stores; but it owed sundry
creditors £5ll. The on. made a clear profit
of £6003 for the six months, but paid £3OO
more than this amount in two Is. divs.
and State div. duty. A new make of ore
has been struck in the north end of the No.
2 level, and the values exposed are expected
to extend to the surface and in depth. As
the shoots are no shorter at No. 2 level
than they were at No. 1, the shaft is being
deepened to 300 ft.
* * * *
Meekatliarra (W.A.) is not doing so
well. Early in the year it was turning out
£30.000 worth of gold a month, and as most
of its mines were either improving, enlarging
or getting entirely new treatment plants, it
was. reckoned that a big increase in output
would soon result. But, instead of doing-
better, several shows have gone back in
their returns, and the total yield has fallen.
The Fenian is still first on the list of
producers, with a monthly output of nearly
£lO.OOO. To date it has yielded over half a
million sterling., and has put more than half
of that into the pockets of shareholders, of
whom there are about a dozen all told. The
deepest workings are at 800 ft.. where
developments are said to be all right.
£30.000 was recently spent on new plant,
and more outlay under this heading is to be
undertaken shortly.
Golden Ridge (W.A.) will probably not
keep the undertaker waiting much longer.
►Shareholders were urged to buck up at the
half-yearly meeting, but at the same time
they were plainly told by the chairman that
there was nothing to look forward to at
depth. Several short runs of low and
medium grade stuff had, he said, built up
the attenuated reserves a bit. but the
chances of the mine continuing as a profit
earner more than another half-year were
not good.
* * * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) has resumed
mining at the Victorious Ora Banda, and
hopes to get the new sulphide mill on the
property going in a week or two. The c<>.
is also doing a little work on the old Good-
enough lease at Menzies. This show was
once a fair producer, but when the original
prospectors sold out it crumpled up. Later
on the late-lamented and once-prosperous
Queensland Menzies ruined itself in trying
to make money out of it.
* •* * *
Galtee More (W.A.), the next-door
neighbor of the Empress at Magnet, has
been optioned by a Melbourne crowd. The
mine has been worked for 15 or 10 years,
and the 11.000-odd tons treated has averaged
about 335. Od.
Oroya Black Range (W.A.) is nibbling
at a group of leases in the neighborhood of
Hancocks on the East Murchison field.
* * * *
Great Fingall (W.A.) has abolished the
night shift and is economising all it knows.
Adelaide Enterprise (W.A.) is again
having trouble with its plant. This and
the scarcity of gold in the ore make the
outlook darker than ever.
Golden Butterfly (W.A.) has explained in
a tearful sort of way that things are at a
standstill because the oxidised ore reserves
suddenly gave out and the sulphides were
not sufficiently opened up to enable milling
to be continued. Values so far met with
in the sulphide zone are declared to be
“satisfactory,” but in 01) cases out of 100
a vague assertion like that is blown out by
the treatment plant.
Manager Williams, of the Edna May
(W.A.), tactfully puts his cards on the table
under date November 2, together with a
choice set of mine plans. The latter dis-
close that the reef was hit by the 225 ft.
crosscut pretty well on the fat part of the
bend in the reef, which came out more pot-
bellied than at the corresponding point at
150 ft., with the ends tapering sharply. On
the measurements given 8000 tons are
proved, and Williams seems to add another
4200 tons for “probable.” Later work amply
justifies this estimate and a bit more.
Williams’s other cards are ore reserves at
150 ft., 27,750 tons, and 12,200 tons still left
in No. 1 level. Total reserves are roughly
52,450 tons, with values ranging from
41s. 6d. to £5 3s. per ton. Gross value of
this bonanza, £230,728; net value, about
£171,000. And as the 150 ft. level had a
shoot 261 ft. long, there isn’t any special
reason (as the country is soft at 225 ft.)
wdiy that length shouldn’t be attained in
the new level. From the field the whisper
travels that the rich stuff round the cross-
cut is shortening. Even so, there is quite
enough rich ore to keep values vei’y steady.
In the past 32,315 tons have yielded
33,8920 z., worth £135,563, or 83s. lOd. per
ton. Out of that £66,418 has gone in divi-
dends, or 31s. per share, with another 3s.
coming for Christmas. With it all it’s hard
to count £7 per share in sight even by
dumping in “probable” ore of the same
extent at the No. 3 level as is proved in
No. 2. More stamps are to go up. a bigger
dividend will be paid on the larger output,
and the shaft is to be whacked down. These
are desirables from the shareholders’ stand-
point ; but they mustn’t forget that the
man with the gun has his finger on the
trigger.
After having turned out 820,2510 z. gold
and paid £1,283,000 in divs., Long Tunnel
goes to rest among the mining gods of the
Victorian Walhalla. When the Pearsons,
11. E. Rowe and A. Harvey shut up the old
co., Harry Hartrick, of Walhalla, stood
sponsor for the mine. As there was labor
to be thought about, and as Herman,
Government Geologist, had a programme,
the State backed the show to the tune of
£15,000 conditionally on an equal amount
being shelled out by shareholders. This
£30.000 lias brought £lO,OOO worth of gold.
This doesn’t even smell like a profit in the
distance, so the gentle shareholder has
w r ound the shroud round the old mining-
giant and let him slip off to his eternal rest.
Summed up, it’s the old story that gold is
richest near the surface, and that the State
is usually au ass to come in when Private
enterprise goes out. Incidentally 150 able-
bodied miners want a job. and the second-
hand machinery gang have a plant to gorge
over.
As New Langi Logan. Ararat, is having
its usual six-monthly flutter, some figures
as to this rake's progress may be dropped
in with advantage. The capital called up
is £101,0(51 ; of this £15,000 went to the
promoters, and £11,252 to the North Langi
and for land. Working account chewed up
£49,004. and plant and buildings took the
balance of £26,000. So far, therefore, the
only chaps who have seen a div. are the
floaters and the artful Ballarat pirates who
know, through spies, far more about the
inside of the mine than the manager does —
or, anyhow, know it sooner. (.’alls have
sizzled down to 4d. per month, and the
water pressure has conveniently dropped to
91b. This and the joining-up with the old
shaft is the flimsy base on which a syndicate
is puffing up the market, no doubt with the
intention of skating out of its holding on
the rise. If the puddlers get on the move
it will help them in this scheme. The idea
is to get the puddlers going, but there isn’t
much chance of a great deal in this way
until a lot more pumping is done. That
costs money, and if the first machines of
wash don’t go over an ounce it will take a
12-inch hardwood prop to keep the roof of
the market up. If they do, and if bores
under the Cathcart gutter from the No. 2
shaft drive give good prospects, the market
will be brisk —for a while. It won’t be remem-
bered for the moment that bores never mean
much; if they did. Great Southern Consols
would have been a div.-payer years ago.
The Hampden-Cloneurry (Q.) is up
against it, and has issued a circular to its
500 employees, telling them that a voluntary
offer to accept 25 p.c. less wages is their
only hope of keeping their jobs. The idea
is to knock off this 25 p.c. while standard
copper is below £54 per ton, rising 5 p.c.
for every £l, until at £59 the employees
would get their present pay. The last 500
tons of copper, tin* manager says, realised
£4S 10s., and cost £54. Very early in the war-
proceedings this paper recommended a scheme
by which it hoped all big Australian mines
might be kept open. It was assumed, of
course, that metals would not be saleable',
and it was suggested that workmen should
accept reduced wages, with coupons entitling
them to deferred pay if the metals, when
realised, brought more than the figure which
it was then hoped the Governments might
advance in paper money. Nothing, how-
ever, came of it, and it is mentioned now
merely as a hint to the miners of North
Queensland that, in The Ruixettn’s
opinion, the times demand a concession from
(hem. But not necessarily the concession
asked for. It is too crude altogether. The
basic £54 may be the fair cost of producing
copper; but the co.’s statement is not con-
vincing on the point. It includes £lO ss.
for “mining development, machinery and
plant and capital expenditure, etc.” This
figure must be more or less arbitrary.
But, anyhow, supposing we accept £54 as
a base, why should there be a reduction of
one farthing in the wages on by the
co. when the price of copper is £54 or over?
When copper falls to £53, it might be a
reasonable thing for the men to voluntarily
agree to a 5 p.c. reduction, so that the loss
to the co. might be shared. But the co.
asks the men to accept a 20 p.c. reduction
when, on its own showing, and without any
reduction of wages at all, it would be mak-
ing a profit of £1 per ton, after providing
for depreciation, development, etc. It isn’t
a fair thing.
* * * *
Hampden Cloncurry estimates that it has
‘>0.020 tons of copper in four mines. Hamp-
den is credited with 3370 tons. Duchess with
8750. Macgregor with 5400. Trikilano with
2500. On the figures the Macgregor is the
lowest-grade show: its estimated 5400 tons
copper are contained in 77.000 tons ore.
This shows only a little over 7 p.c.; hence
mechanical concentration in some form or
other is certain to be adopted. Hand-picking
is suggested for a start. The Duchess isn’t
by any means a big mine; it has only 61,000
tons of ore blocked out in four levels, but the
grade averages over 14 p.c. Trikilano has
20,000 tons developed averaging 124 p.c.
The reserves total 249,000 tons in half a
dozen mines separated by considerable dis-
tances, so that apart from the rich streak in
the Duchess there isn’t much to admire.
* * * *
Wallaroo and Moonta (S.A.), where the
wages always follow the copper market, has
had to prune its pay-sheet. The directors’
fee is lopped 20 p.c. with the rest. A con-
tract lias just been let to open the lode from
Taylor’s shaft (Wallaroo) at a vertical
depth of 2670 ft. There are 20 fathoms to
sink and a crosscut to drive before the lode
will be reached. Values at 2550 ft. run
about 4 p.c. copper, so there isn’t anything
sensational in these deep levels.
* * * *
At Charters Towers the New Brilliant
Freehold is just about holding its own. The
credit balance of £11,384 compares with
£10.441 12 months previously. During the
past half-year the Freehold crushed 5111
tons for £18,662, which includes a clean-up
of the battery plates. The Day Dawn
formation is played out, and even the latest
discovery on the hanging-wall side isn’t
much more than payable. Attention is now
being turned to the old Brilliant formation,
which, however, is disturbed by a dyke near
the Blocks’ boundary. The Freehold will
continue to sink below No. 8 level, and it
is just possible that in prospecting near the
dyke it may pick up profitable stone. The
co. has about Is. 6d. per share in hard cash,
and its interest in the Burdekin mill is
valued at £2363.
Rev. W. Davey, a retired Methodist
minister., bought a house and a bit of laud
in Maldon (Vic.) tor £2OO. Tributors
secured the right of muting in his back
yard on a royalty of 15 p.c. of all gold
won. In two months they had crushed 12
tons for lOSoz., and the rev. gent, lifted £(>•>.
A. F. ■ Showers’s jaunt to the Philippine
Dredges wasn’t time wasted, nor was .John
McWhae s trip to London. The latter placed
serin while Showers put bis finger on dredge
troubles. No. 2 dredge seems to have struc-
tural complaints, and all the working parts
appear to have got incrustations through
taking too much local water. Tumblers have
been wrong, ground has been shallow, and
output has been coming down. Still the
Philippines Dredge people are hopeful—
though for them it looks a long way to Tip-
pet a ry.
Shareholder: (1) No. (2) No. If the
N.S.W. Companies Act were not a thing
to be ashamed of the answers would be

TO THE SOLDIERS.
LORD KITCHENER’S MESSAGE.
The public of Sydney has been waiting
ever since the cables came through stating
that the British Expeditionary Forces had
proceeded to France, for the full text of
Lord Kitchener’s advice to each member of
that historic company. It has now been
cabled out, and one of the chief of all sen-
tences in it, and fraught with great mean-
ing, reads: “Your duty cannot be done
unless your health is sound.”
Health to the soldier fighting for his
country, or to the civilian fighting the great
trade battles at home, is essential. A
healthy army should be a successful army,
and Captain H. E. U. Burke, formerly of
the “Third King’s African Rifles,” British
East Africa, states that Clements Tonic is
the ideal nerve medicine for the soldier on
active service, or recuperating after severe
illness or fever. It is the medicine that has
always been to the front throughout Aus-
tralia, and its effect upon weak or sorely-
tried nerves is little short of miraculous.
All chemists and stores sell it everywhere.*
Otard Brandy
15 YEARS OLD

Cognac, where Francois 1., King of France, was born.
This Chateau now forms the cellars and premises of
THE MAISON OTARD-DUPUY. For sickness or

to equal.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, December 7, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
No one doubts the courage of a king who
dared to u.ty precedent by bringing a civil
action for slander against his traducers. So
there seems to be no special reason why
George V. should not take pot-luck among
the shells, except the sentimental effect of
bis presence upon T. Atkins. The Prince of
y is with the army, and his next bro-
ther is said to be taking chances on board
ship in the North Sea —described on old
maps as the German Ocean. If a huge dis-
aster, or series of disasters, happened, our
next King would be Henry Ninth, now
aged 144.
Governor Strickland is bringing eldest
daughter Mary to town for the big Red
( ross rally in the Hall of the Municipal
bathers this (Monday) eve. The huge corro-
boree created a fiex'ce demand for seats.
Last week the committee went into ambush
in consequence, and stealthily doled out the
pasteboards with due regard to the fact that
°ur Hotel de Ville is not constructed with
elastic sides.
The Women Painters’ Show suffered from
the plethora of art that made a simultaneous
dash to reach the public eye, and sales were
small. A. Hedle.v Parsons sold a couple of
small bits of scenery, but outside that and
the mild plunge by the Gallery Trustees,
little business was done.
Mabel Barling, who has a fancy for zoo-
logical specimens, is a clever youngster who
mav some day go far as a beast painter.
Just liow she covers too much canvas with
lean lions. On one pictui’e she asks, “Are
the Lions Hungry?”—a “Sign of the Cross”
episode. You may safely tell her they are.
Mabel’s animals, depicted in the catacombs,
are not merely hungry, but properly starved
and in ravenous trim to attack the calves of
Julius Superbus.
Mayor Betts, of Goulburn, a gi’andson of
Parson Sam Marsden, is tripping to Maori-
land. Just a hundred years ago the
Dominion was favored with a brief taste of
the Rev. Samuel’s sledge-hammer rhetoric
when he rounded up Brown Brother in the
North Island. Auckland Anglican clerics
are, therefore, going to hold a Marsden cen-
tenary party on Christmas Day, and grand-
son Betts has been asked to be present.
A Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Consuls would fill an immediate want. The
chief sufferers are the official representa-
tives. of Belgium and France. These victims
are immolated nightly on the altar of some
Patriotic fund. Committee ladies, egged on
by a desire to have a good spread on the
official carpet, where the large, fat leather
chairs are drawn up together, regard these
unfortunate people as their legitimate prey.
The Cause is urgent, however poor tlie
entertainment may be.
The plain citizen can yawn and sneak
home before the junior pupils have finished
their heartrending efforts to sing the “Mar-
seillaise” for the fourteenth time in 24 hours.
But the diplomats, marooned on a cold blue
island of Axminster, have no such luck.
There they sit- —French Consul Cliayet, dis-
guising his sufferings behind a patient smile;
Belg an Consul Watteeuw clasping his opera
hat under his arm before depositing it ten-
derly on the carpet. They know that if each
iteny is encoi’ed three times, and if there
are 30 items oix the programme, they must
remain till the last Boy Scout has personally
hurled his defiance at the enemy and Stood
on the Burning Deck. Hence the ui’gent
need for a Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Consuls.
Miss Enid Turton, a daughter of one of
the dix-ectors of the Winchcombe-Casson wool
company, was wed to Neville Read the other
evening. The ’gi'oom is a son of Dr. Richard
Read, of Wahroonga. The Turton family,
which is diminishing by matrimony, makes
Clifton Gardens its headquartei's. The same
sea-splaslied tavei’n often shelters the Jinx
Allisons, of Coomoo Coomoo station. Mai’-
joi'ie of that ilk (LTarry Laxxder will tell you
what “ilk” means! was one of bride Enid’s
maidens at the altar.
Robert Dickie Watt, the shy Scotchman
who is Professor of Agriculture at Sydney
Uni., is engaged to Madge Forsvth, a Rand-
wick girl. When the Ayrshire man first
arrived here and turned his broad Scotch
accent on local society, it could only infer
that he was “vei-y naice” in a subdued whis-
per. But he has made some progress since
those callow days, tie was well under 30
at the time.
Where are the dolls of yesteryear? A
good many thousands of the sawdust belles
are probably interned at Sonneberg, in the
Thuringian Foi’est. There’s a great scarcity
this Christmas of the special waxen idol that
comes from the German village whei’e two-
tliirds of the population used to be doll-
makers. Sonneberg’s specialty is the nude
lady with flossy hair and arms and legs that
move up and down. The cherubic Sonne-
berg baby-doll is another prime favorite with
little Australians, but I’m told it is rather
hard to locate just now. Tliat is our
chance. We needn’t fall back on the
American article if Australian women could
be trained in the profitable business and
the Commonwealth Parliament would
guarantee them some protection.
The youthful Evelyn Chapman got 75
guineas out of the cautious old gentlemen
who buy for the National Gallery. “Blue
and Gold” is the fanciful name of her paint-
ing. The pretty Sydney girl had her first
lessons from Dattilo Rubbo, the picturesque
person who specialises in depicting the
wrinkles of old age. Since then she has
studied two years in Paris.
Dr. Scot Skirving is among the passen-
gers by the incoming English mail steamer.
*le was offered numei’ous war-jobs, or,
rather, jobs at mending damages done by the
wai% but all of them demanded a longer
absence from home than his practice would
allow.
Henry Lucy, the aged and very dull Lon-
don journalist, has again been drivelling
over the sorrows of the rich. The Rich are
Lucy’s friends. The ci’owned heads of
Europe are his pals. To the British aristo-
cracy he is a faithful watchdog or soup-
hound. Paying a week-end visit in Kent
(you know at once the friend was a Per-
sonage), Lucy discovered his host’s great
loss. Briefly, his horses had been com-
mandeered by the British Government
within 24 hours of the war. “Out of the
eight,” said the sorrowing master, “there
were six I wouldn’t have been tempted to
sell by an offer of £lOOO each. They gave
me £250 for four, £7O a head being the
maximum price allowed by the War Office.
That I didn’t mind” (didn’t he!), “but they
took away my daily companions, who would
feed out of my hand, and who turned round
with big loving eyes to look at me when I
entered the stable!” Picture Lxicy’s sobs of
sympathy that a wealthy Englishman should
have to suffer so much for his country! Why
didn’t the man offer £3OOO in cash to buy
the animals back?
The George Earp domicile, Uig Lodge l ,
on the terraced heights of Point Piper, where
the Nor’-easter tears the hair off your head
or anybody else’s head, was lit up with the
usual illuminations the other moonlit eve.
The mixed bazaar, garden party, concert aiid
fireworks display was opened by Goveimor
Strickland. A Rose Bay parish building
fund, in connection with Parson D’Arcy
Irviiie’s cure of souls, was the cause. Help
d’Apioe slid down a toboggan on a bump-
proof matti-ess to show how easily winter
sports can be carried on in the depth of
summer, and a large attendance of local
suburbia lingered round the cracker display.
Next afternoon the show continued, with a
Maypole dance and a brass band. Mrs.
Earp looked after the events under the brim
of a Dolly Varden hat. Mrs. Harry Finn
and titian-haired daughter Moya did their
best to push the proceedings along. Mrs.
Neville Mayman lent her aid to a stall,
which also enshrined pretty Olga Roth as
saleswoman.
The final performance of “Pinafore,” at
Her Majesty’s, gave Gladvs Moncrieff, the
new Queensland soprano, a great oppor-
tunity ; and the most jaded playgoer in a
crowded audience had something unusual for
his money in consequence. A young girl,
with a sweet, pure voice, no mannerisms, and
a charming stage presence, Gladys was the
ideal Josephine. After the knowing-looking
comic-opera ladies, who are generally too
busy sending honeyed smiles to their gentle-
man friends in the stalls to worry about
the?i stage business, a genuine Girl is worth
a bouquet.
Gi*ace Watson, writing from the other
side, asks: ‘.‘Are you getting scare cables
telling you of London’s fear of Zeppelins?
As a matter of fact, London is as calm and
unruffled as the Y’arra at Twickenham Ferry
—if you know where that is. Just now I’m
up to my eyes lecturing in an honorai-y
capacity for the Victoria League. To-
night I’m going to speak-up to 300 soldiers’
wives in the roughest part of London. Per-
sonally I prefer the slums—for lecturing
only. Local color is right, of course; but
the local smell is rather overpowering....
Believe all you l’ead of the enemy’s cruelties.
The mutilation of little Belgian babies, to
be seen in London by those who want proof
of these horrors, puts the enemy outside the
pale.”
This letter l-eached me from an address at
a post-office box in an obscure town in South
Africa. No money or evidence was enclosed.
I have altered the names for fear of a
ruinous libel action :
Kindly insert the following article in your papers
as follows. A Mrs. Afrikander, who is residing in
Sydney, is not a widow, as she is representing herself
to be. She absconded from here with a man bv the
name of Christian de Wet Browne.
And, furthermore, she has a 13-months old baby
with her. [Here follows a dreadful libel on a certain
Van Jones, who is said to hang out in the obscure
Boer town where my correspondent has a box at the
post-office.]
Kindly let me know the cost of Insertions and
will remit you the money without delay.
Yours faithfully, Anne Boercat.
The business manager says that the money
must be sent in advance, and that he can't
give credit to a lady in a box at a post office.
All the same, the letter made me feel
pleased. Evidently mv influential contribu-
tion to this paper is read in far countries,
and “Vandorian” is more important than
she was aware of.
The Innes-Noad family is about to con-
tract an alliance (this has the genuine court-
chronicle flavor), through daughter Cecily
with a British tar. The groom has the
attractive name of Shelley Stuart, and is a
lieutenant on the Encounter. This ci’aft, by
the way, is passing nearly all its quarter-
deck marines along to the local moneyed
girl. Skipper Lewin married Miss Ruth
Dangar a few months ago, and there are
others. Cecily is a niece of Spruce Myth,
M.11.R.
Organist Truman produced a festival of
his own compositions in the Town Hall the
other evening.
The ’phone at Baldpate Inn, which has
been working overtime at the Criterion, will
soon take a well-earned rest. Another ’Mur-
kan play is to follow. In the audience the
other evening I noticed young barrister
Nicholas, who lately married an Adelaide
girl. They met on the long, wet trip to the
other side.
Roy E. O'Halloran, ixow of this town, is
going to wed Miss Jessie Ilyern, of Moonee
Ponds, in Victoria. The young man is a
son of solicitor E. W. O’Halloran, of Adel-
aide, and a nephew of Colonel Ilawkei’, of
the R.A.G.A.
The Australian War Contingent Associa-
tion in London has been having a family
row, at a time when peace would be more
useful to the cause. The squabble surged
round the appointment of a man as hon.
seci’etary to the women’s section. A strong
protest came from Australian women in
England. “When the United Kingdom is
calling for men to go to the front, it is no
time for an Australian committee to invite
a man to carry out duties which, even in
peace time, are more within the province of
a woman.” George Reid’s L.d.v was appealed
to, as the referee who should dislodge the
male person from the unpaid billet. Nothing
startling had happened when the last mail
left Tilbury.
Workers in the multitude of Red Cross
Societies have their lighter interludes. One
strenuous organiser of socks and woollen
comforters was rushed at by a gasping
feminine acquaintance the other morn. “Can
you tell me the exact date when the war will
end?” she said. The Red Ci’oss angel mod-
estly disclaimed any exclusive information
oil this seething question. “Oh,” said the
other, “I thought the Red Cross workers
were sure to know. I thought it was part
of your ti’aining!” Even Kitchener must
be weary of denying imaginary interviews
with American reporters as to the exact day
when a disappointed Kaiser will commit
suicide by hanging himself to the gas-fittings
of the banqueting hall at Potsdam.
Mrs. Harry Rickards has, as usual, booked
the Town Hall crvnt for her big Christmas
dinner to the poor. The late Rickards in-
stituted this annual feast, and his widow
keeps iqi the benevolent scheme.
Dorothy Little, of this town, is engaged
to Lieutenant Eardley Wilmot, of the
Encounter. I can’t tell you where this craft
is at present, because if I did the Censor
would bury the remark under the G.P.O.
foundations. The young man who has bee*n
i-ecently annexed is described as the second
son of the late Colonel Sir William Asslieton
Eardley Wilmot, Bart., of London. It’s
unfortunate that bai'onets can’t pass round
a helping of their little bit of glitter to
second sons; but since they can’t, the re-
flected splendor must suffice.
Popular young George Mai'ich, son of the
potentate of Paling’s, has disjoined himself
from the Sydney sharebrokery to which he
has hitherto been attached, and has nailed
his own signpost to the wall.
The N.S.W. Theatre League, which throbs
with budding amateurs, is going to produce
“In Honor Bound”—a one-act drama by
Sydney Grundy—and “The Truants.” This
outbreak, which is in aid of the Pati’iotic
locker, takes place in the Repertory Theatre
on December 12 and 14.
Miss Kate Macarthur King is booked to
say “I will” to A. J. Webster, of Armidale,
on December 12. The ’groom’s father man-
ages the Commercial Bank at Paddington—
where the trams thunder down the dusty in-
cline and cheap dogs disperse like spray
before the flying wheels. The Nice Girl
belongs to the well-known woolly Macarthur
clan on mamma’s side of the house.
Birrell Robertson has arranged an open-
ing scene or speech-making to introduce the
late Miss Emily Meston’s pictures to the
public. I hope the time is opportune. But
the recent orgy of canvas is still fresh in
our seared memory. Still, A. B. Piddington,
K.C., who opens the show as I nail this
missive together, will do his legal best to
spread a little suitable oratory on the Meston
brush-work. Anthony Hordern’s Fine Art
Gallery is the place.
The long-threatened Dolls’ Carnival fills
the Town Hall with its sawdust and glassy
stare this week. For two days, December 11
and 12, the show will display its wares, and
the show ladies will chase the public for
every copper that hasn’t been melted out of
it for the Patriotic funds. The proceeds go
to the Alexandra Hospital for Sick Children,
which finds its subscriptions languish in
these stormy times.
Oswald Anderson, the song-writer who
has been on the other side for some time,
gets a welcome back this week. The At
Home will be strictly musical and the meal
of melody will be laid out by Mrs. Charles
Walshe in Paling’s Concert Hall.
Who is Sylvia and what is she? This
digression might be turned on to Fashion in
its present uncertain mood of smiles and
tears. Heart-rending descriptions of summer
sales that are going to slaughter softgoods
turn out to be less disastrous —to the sales-
man —than might be inferred. Prices keep
up to a sound commercial level. The best
proof of the confidence of Woman in the good
years to come is the spirit of self-sacrifice in
which she buys herself a New Hat at fre-
quent intervals. After paying a few sove-
reigns for a rose and a fluff of tulle, and stab-
bing it with a hatpin, Woman awaits with
fortitude the end of the enemy’s machina-
tions.
The Sydney Liedertafel goes on its quiet
way without threatening to climb Olympian
heights. The recent concert was a fair-to-
raedium effort, with Elgar’s music, sung by
the full strength of the Lieder voices, as the
best item in a mediocre programme. Con-
ductor Arundel Orchard was in charge, and
Laurence Godfrey Smith attacked the piano
in his usual masterful manner. In fact, the
piano fled before him like the German Land-
sturm —the old warriors with spectacles—
when the Cossack sticks a pin into his horse
to promote velocity, and charges for all he
is worth.
A matinee ball for youngsters is going to
happen in Sargents’ on December 12. The
usual fancy sets are likely to create a fren-
zied desire on the part of two-thirds of the
infants present to appear as Belgium or
Britannia. Poor little Servia, which has
been stubbornly kicking out invaders since
the end of July, isn't so well advertised, pos-
sibly because her national garb is less spec-
tacular. Poland, which is almost in tatters,
too, is likewise a bit behind the door when
fancy rags are being handed out. The funds
from this juvenile party go towards filling
the hungry with good things on Christmas
Day.
Miss Mills, a daughter of J. Y. Mills, had
her trip to England smashed by the war.
The plump little soprano came back a while
ago to her native gum-tree. She has been
doing the inevitable thing since her return,
and warbling for the Patriotic locker. This
brings in no dollars. Still, the musicians
who are scratching up gold-dust for the
Cause ought to have a good time in the
sweet by-and-bve. I only hope it won’t turn
sour by being kept too long. Anyhow. Miss
Mills will uplift her voice in the Charity
Club show this Wednesday. The cash goes
towards Christmas hampers for the wives
and kiddies of Tommy Cornstalk, who is
now, with Pharaoh as an ally, scanning the
Egyptian horizon for the Unspeakable’s fez.
The young school marms who toil round
the Free Kindergarten schools are already
in the throes of breaking-up parties. By
way of having a high-brow entertainment to
themselves, there’s the annual soiree in St.
James’s Hall on December 14.
Miss Braddon was 77 years past her
cradle in Octobei-. She is still turning out
saleable novels, and flung off her 74th plot,
embroidered with pleasant fiction, in 1913.
Miss Braddon is a fond memory of days
when the whole world seemed gay. and the
Young Pei’son l-ead Audrey’s Seci’et”
by the flickering light of secreted candle
ends. Some embittered American critic
said that her stories were all the same, and
that the heroine could be identified by the
pi’ofusion of jewellery on her forearm, and
the fact that she was seen kissing the villain
in front of the mysterious bureau, while her
three husbands lurked behind it with murder
in their souls. And Bret Ilarte scoffed at
her with a l’ather inferior scoff in his_ “Con-
densed Novels.” The lady’s home in _ St.
John’s Wood is the Mecca of youthful scribes
who like to sit at the feet of the kindly old
story-writer. She has consistently dodged
the interviewei’, and has never figui-ed in the
self-advertising which invades even modern
nursing on the stressful battlefield. Her
picturesque brother, Premier Braddon, of
Tasmania, said her writings were “rot.”
The Sisters of Mercy, who rule over St.
Brigid’s Orphanage at Ilyde, have under
their care 100 parentless children, for whom
they ask me to make the usual Christmas
appeal. You can be good to them in money
or in kind.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER,
Melbourne, December 7, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie, —
pororthy Sternberg, of Sydney, was duly
married the other evening to Leslie Benja-
-1111 a * s a son of Ben jy Benjy,
ex-May or of Melbourne. It is no good say-
ing it was a quiet wedding. I know the
phrase is expected of me. But it wasn't
quiet. It simply couldn't be. There was too
much money floating around. Also, too many
relatives. Likewise too many Hebrews —
wild. gay. lads who would find it
difficult to suppress their hilarity at an ex-
amination in bankruptcy. The bride wore
pink—pink cheeks, pink dress, pink shoes
and stockings, pink everything. She looked
sweet, but the old Peruvian adage, “Pink
duds, poor luck,"’ proved itself, yet again, in
her case. The tyre of her car burst, or the
differentials fell out, or the tank exploded.
Anyhow, she was kept waiting for fully
a quarter of an hour in the St. Kilda-road
while the evening breezes blew her pink tulle
veil about, and the multitude gathered
around and made remarks. Then another
car transpired, and she was enabled to haste
to the wedding. The subsequent meal was
at the Grand Hotel. There were shoals of
yachtsmen at it—friends of the bridegroom,
who is a confirmed sea-dog—and the waggish
salts, with true maritime wit, plastered the
happy couple's luggage with big labels in-
scribed “newly married.” Yet there are folks
wbo say that the sense of humor of our race
is slowly atrophying. They left in the end
for Port Somewhere or other. I tried to get
the correct address so that the yachtsmen
might call on them and have a few more
jokes, but for some reason they were reticent
on the subject.
Dr. Tom Dunhill is on the way to the elu-
sive Front. Although only a little over 30,
Dunhill is already well up towards the fore-
most rank of Victoria’s surgeons. He
has made goitre his speciality, and
has been so successful in his operations
(which have to be effected without anaes-
thetics) that he is in demand all over Aus-
tralia. A few months ago he married a nice
girl, who is also on her way to the Front
with healing inclinations.
_ More excitement. Mrs. President Warreii-
Kerr is calling a conference of all the
Ladies Benevolent Societies ; and, as though
to add a final touch of delirium to the
function, the Mayor is to be in the chair.
Preparations are afoot for the Australian
1 niversities’ Musical Congress of 1915 —
the first that Australia will have known.
The Ilennessys and others —chiefly of the
long-haired division —propose to meet and
make remarks on the subject this week.
Sassiety, surfeited with soldiers, is turn-
ing lightly to horses. A number of local
noble-women have dashed aside the half-
finished sock and jettisoned the incomplete
Balaklava helmet, and started making
bandages and sun-hats and bearing reins
and firing-irons, and even curbs and splints
and strangles, for the furtherance of the
comfort of man’s best friend. A complete
set of blind staggers is the sort of thing a
horse appreciates on the long road to
Berlin, especially when made by busy fingers
in the homeland. Miss Maude Harvey is
the leading spirit in the new movement.
On Saturday, December 12, it is to be pushed
along by an “Eastern Entertainment.”
I suppose this means a sort of Asiatic
vaudeville show. Anyhow, it is to be at the
Austral Salon, and Minister Pearce and I
are to be there, and Rose Seaton will sing
Edwin Arnold’s “With Sadi in the Garden”
to the bitter end. unless stopped ; and Mr.
Hunt will play Mirza. and Maud .Tolliffe will
be a dancing girl. The horses will get the
proceeds; the rest of us will be satisfied
with the fame.
The St. Kilda Dandies have scored a
Belgian refugee as solo violinist. His name
is Cor-de-Bly, and he was in Antwerp when
it fell. An earlier violinist fiddled while
his native city burned. The Dandies’ new
acquisition showed better taste. He simply
fled. lie was staged for the first time in
the open air before a Belgian Flag Curtain.
He is young and more or less beautiful, and
wears a decoration which is said to have
been forced upon him by King Albert. He
has an affecting sadness of mien, and gives
a powerful impression that his strong heart
is breaking as he draws soft, searching
sounds from his instrument. He also closes
his eyes in a soulful, yearning manner, and
in other respects comes well up to
expectations.
St. Kilda has its statue of Captain Cook
all set up. Perhaps it ought to have been
on the higher ground of the Esplanade; but
Andrew Stenhouse, who presented it, wanted
it before his own house, from which it is
divided by the public road, and that didn’t
seem a large thing to allow. Of course the
design doesn’t please everybody. The legs
have a rather ungraceful straddle, and
suggest Gulliver letting the Lilliputians
through. The costume is Gulliver all over.
Cook gazes over the expanse of Hobson’s
Bay. In his right hand he holds a pair of
compasses, and in the left apparently a menu
or a card of the races.
Writes my Adelaide correspondent:—
The popular Van Doussa brothers, Alfred and
Louis, possibly the best-known South Australians
living outside the city, have had to get busy with
the idiots who, on account of the inherited name,
accuse them of being in wireless communication
with Berlin and things like that. “Wo don’t know
anybody in Germany,” the brothers say pathetically.
“We have no interests there; and we can’t even
speak the language.” So now the newspapers are
bearing crops of apologies from men and women who
have been curtly requested to “prove it,” but pre-
fer to get out and get under. Meanwhile Simpson,
Mayor of Adelaide, has curtly refused to call a
public meeting for the hounding down of similar
good citizens; and lt.C. Archbishop O’Reilly applauds
the refusal. The South Aus. “German” population
mostly dates from 1848, and (except in a few
villages) has intermarried with others so freely that
the third generation neither talks, looks nor thinks
anything but Australian.
The “Federal” Art Exhibition, much damaged this
year by N.S.W., which ignored the Adelaide show’s
long-standing claim to November, has closed after
running a quiet course. Private buyers bought
several small flower or landscape bits, but are mostly
giving their spare cash to war funds. S.A. Art
Gallery, in the pretty-general absence of inter-State
claims, spent its usual little lot on Adelaide men,
taking a good, characteristic wharves-on-the-Seine
by Will Ashton, and a hills landscape by the
steadily “coming” Gus Barnes.
Melba pronounced, while here, on the voices of
Miss Kleinschmidt (Clara Sei'ana, professionally
speaking), Gladys Cilento, and a contralto from the
Lower North; and George Brooke, of Melbourne,
who is with the Dandies. She also listened to
pianist Cahill. She thought highly of them all, o’r,
at least, someone says she said she did.
The Way memorial fund stands at over £4OO,
and on Monday afternoon, at the Children’s Hospital,
the presentation was made to the Chief Justice as
president. The money was spent on a memorial cot
for the Colton-Campbell ward, a portrait of the Way
dame and a few minor gifts. Provision was also
made for a memorial window at Christ Church,
Strathalbyn—the pleasant township where the good
lady spent most of her life.
The University authorities have formally per-
mitted Professor Watson to visit the war. He is
above the age limit, and so is going on his own
account. Dr. C. IT. ICelleway, of Melbourne, will be
Professor of Anatomy in his absence. Incidentally,
Professor Portiis, who took Professor Henderson’s
place while he was on vacation, has returned to
Sydney.
The police have resumed the offensive in the
matter of uncovered hatpins (though, as a fact, these
weapons are now as rare as auks), and officers spend
arduous days in Rundle-street looking for guilty
slaves to last year’s fashion. It is a great time for
the suburban burglar.
Dean I oung and his daughter are back from the
U.S. after six months’ absence. Which reminds me
that the 11. K. Collisons, who have been for a good
many years at Mount Gnmbier, are settling in
Craters.
On last Saturday the Annual Fete at the
Children’s Hospital transpired, and the usual big
cheque materialised.
The opening of the State Parliament was
comparatively exciting—not so much so, pos-
sibly. as the bombardment of Lodz, but still
in that class. A thrill ran through the
Assembly when it was known that a Royal
Commissioner had to be appointed to swear
the new members in, there being no Speaker
on hand. Governor Stanley’s speech was
short since it was necessarily all about
Finance, and State Finance is no subject to
talk much about if there are ladies present.
In the Council J. M. Davies was put back
into the chair in due course, and Frank
Madden was once more chosen Speaker of
the Assembly, and Justice Ilodges was con-
gratulated on the skilful manner in which he
had sworn in new members while the chairs
were empty. The President’s wife gave a
tea-party afterwards. She wore some 'tapes-
try vesting in her black frock, and a black
bonnet, which had the words Virtue and Good
Sense inscribed all over it. Lady Stanley
was there in a Tuscan straw head-protector
or helmet, with a profuse garniture of
cherries. It suited her admirably. For that
matter, everything does. George Turner’s
lady wore a yellow brocade petticoat, seven
inches deep, round an otherwise sedate and
matronly black gown. A train shied at it.
so I am told, and nearly destroyed a new
brass band. So I won’t complain about it
further. Our Mayoress looked trim and neat
in navy blue, with a bright cockade in her
hat. Farthing, M.L.A., shone from the re-
cesses of his top hat to his shoe-tips, and
East Melbourne girls gathered round in large
numbers and yearned at him. Many of them
had canvassed on his behalf at the recent
elections, and so had a certain right to yearn.
Another who attracted a goodly host of
yearners was the Vice-Consul for the Nether-
lands. He is a really lovely creature —
young, pink-cheeked, bright-eyed—such a one,
in brief, as any girl would leave her happy
home for, assuming always, that he had a
better one to offer her.
Everybody’s doing it. Even the Mel-
bourne Shakspearian Society is giving a
patriotic concert to-morrow (Friday) night.
For myself, I am thinking of organising a
patriotic concert on behalf of the Cocos
Islanders —as a mark of sympathy. The
Eastern Extension men have few excite-
ments. There are neither pubs nor picture
shows in the place. The fact that there is
not a bailiff or process-server on the island
ill compensates for the total absence of news-
papers. The only way the Cocosites learn
of the world’s murders and so on is by pick-
ing up a barrel of old papers that has been
charitably jettisoned by a passing steamer.
And then, the S.vdney-Emden fight was pro-
moted, as it were, at their very doors. One
of the most dramatic episodes of the war was
staged before their thrill-famished eyes.
What happened? Their usual rotten luck
pursued them. The Germans on the island
ordered them into cellars. They saw prac-
tically nothing of the historic duel. If ever
men needed sympathy they do. My idea
is to collect enough money to buy the ser-
vices of a set of strolling bellow-dramatic
players for them, or to stock the island with
jaguars, or maroon on the beach one or two
of the bands which have started in Australia
since the war. Anything to give the poor
boys a little badlv-needed excitement. What
do you think of the notion, my dear?
The Gleeson pupils’ concert duly came off
last week. The Auditorium was almost full
—a remarkable tribute, either to the popu-
larity of Miss Gleeson or to the affectionate
relations existing between the pupils and
their friends and relatives. It is question-
able if the crowd was due to love of Art.
since at the time the Town Hall, the
Masonic and the Athenaeum were all at the
mercy of musical shows of one sort of
another. The pupils first presented Miss
Gleeson with a watch, and then got sternly
to work. Isabel Beddell. an East Melbourne
girl, startled the house. One heard it say-
ing “Gracious me!” and “There now!” on
all sides. She has the physique of a Clara
Butt. The voice isn’t quite the same, but it
promises to be, when it grows up, and what
more can a voice do? Another charming
feature of the entertainment was Ella
Elliot’s soprano.
Hoyt’s Olympia invited the local Great
World to view the screening of War and the
Woman last week. We went along hoping
for the worst in the way of up-to-date blood-
shed. but were merely shown the story of an
aviating French girl who loves the son of a
Servian. After flying busily about the Bal-
kans for a while she comes to rest in her
adored one’s arms in the lurid light of a
blood-red battlefield. It was affecting, but
it didn’t contribute much to Sassiety’s know-
ledge of war-conditions.
Mrs. Rogers Thompson. Empress—l mean
Mayoress—of Malvern, gave a party last
week. Her consort helped to entertain the
thousand and odd loyalists who turned up.
The Crokers were there, and the Norman
Bayleses and the Fairbairns and the Apple-
tons, and Fanny Dango Mackay (in the most
beautiful clothes), and Mrs. Henry Noyes
(who gave the X-rays outfit to the hospital
ship), and Mrs. Carty Salmon, and a heap
more. A very new Caulfield Mayoress—
Mrs. Fred Eggleston—looked a dream, and
so did Mrs. Dutton Green, who rules over
Brighton. There were flowers, food, tea. a
band—but, as I said before, it was a mayoral
party.
Arthur Streeton has been painting the
Buffaloes, and intends to show the results in
Melbourne very soon.
Arthur A. Burch, of Sydney and the Auto-
matic Telephones Co. (he bears up pluekd.v
under the accusation of being a son of Dr.
De Witt Clinton Burch, free-born citizen of
Grand Rapids, near Chicago. U.S.A.),
was married on November 27 at St.
Jude’s Vicarage, Carlton, to Miss Muriel
Wayne Sidebottom. She is a daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. William Sidebottom,
of Estcourt. St. Kilda-road, Melbourne
(C.0.A.). When all the names and
addresses of the parties and their relatives
are placed on end they stretch from Port
Phillip Heads to Hobart, where the bride’s
father was M.L.A. for 10 years. The new
Mrs. Burch is 20 years young, and she pos-
sesses a 17-year-old sister who has just
become engaged. Both girls have been accus-
tomed for years to drive their own motors
and repair the same when necessary, being
the holders of several of the higher degrees
conferred by local garages or car-mining
establishments. To see the younger one take
a carburetter to pieces, mislay the screws in
the petrol tank or elsewhere, and at once
supply all deficiencies with hairpins and bits
of string, is to get an insight into the march
of mechanical genius in woman. When not
driving or repairing cars the girls of this
family play violins, paint, draw, sew, knit,
talk, go to theatres and concerts, eat. sleep,
and so on. As you say, a busy lot, my dear.
To get back to the wedding. It was a quiet,
almost noiseless, affair, but for the machine-
gun effect of the champagne corks. It
occurred at Estcourt, the chief Sidebottom
mansion. The bride looked angelic in a
white cloth coat and skirt. When all was
over she'left with her husband on a brief
motor-trip. Her relations and friends had
hardly time to dust the house and change
their costumes ere she was back again and in
the midst of another reception. And, finally,
she left for Sydney and the Rose Bay home
of her telephonic spouse wearing a navy-blue
silk dress and a bonnet with an embroidered
blue travelling veil which reached to her
knees, and other effects too numerous to
chronicle. She is going to Tasmania for the
next race season.
The Percy Chirnsides are battling fiercely
to keep their 17-year-old son from going to
the front. The boy’s pretty mother has
routed him several times already, and his
father holds a strategically offensive position
in the affair; but the bloodthirsty lad per-
sists in his intention.
The Adelaide Register (4/12/T4) adver-
tised the birth of a son to Mr. and Mrs.
Glasemann, of “German New Guinea.”
Except that there is no such place, the inti-
mation may be taken as correct. The
mother used to be Martha Bruggeman, the
singer.
The big Conservatorium matinee at Her
Majesty’s in aid of the Red Cross happened
on Saturday. Several Governors and Con-
suls were there. Lady Stanley showed the
tip of her nose and a hat brim from the
dark of a box. Tommy Cochrane, the sec-
retary of the movement, dived in presently,
and gave her a huge bunch of pink lilies.
lift locked adorable in grey clothes and a pink
shirt. A pink shirt, unless worn with a
red tie and magenta socks, is one of the
most alluring male embellishments I know.
The Hennessys were there, as. indeed, they
always are. They are as indispensable to
these functions as the band. There were
also a number of Germans —chiefly in the
dress-circle. They must have come for the
music. They wore the sort of .clothes that
one associates with music. Pretty girls in
expensive frocks carried rose-sprays about
and sold them to the highest bidders. Mrs.
Oswald S vine sat at the head of the stairs
in receipt of moneys for sweets, programmes
and posies. Fritz Mart conducted his
"Pierrette"—an opera full of individuality.
Roberts, as Pierrot, and Miss Warman, as
Pierrette, gave the thing a professional air.
An amateur performance of an act from
“Madame An got" was full of Society maidens
used to drawing-rooms but very much at sea
in a stage chorus. Chorus girls know how
to stand and move. The only other item
was a bit from “Orpheus,” a tremendous
attempt by Oonservatorium girls. Randolph
ISedford’s daughter sang well, in a large
contralto, and looked well likewise. She
repelled, in a most convincing fashion, the
wily advances of Eurydice (M iss Kirk-
caldie), who lather wailed in her singing,
but was adorably draped in white.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.


£.lOO REWARD
SCHWEPPES LIMITED.
TO THE PUBLIC—
We are instructed by our Clients, Schweppes Limited, the well-known Manufacturers
of Mineral Waters, to make the following statement in consequence of false and
malicious rumors having been spread that they are a German Linn.
The original Jacob Schweppe was a Swiss, who having been in partnership with
two other Swiss citizens (the original founders of Soda Water), at Geneva, as artificial
mineral-water manufacturers, from the year 1760, came to London in 1794 to set up a
similar business for himself by processes which, with modifications and improvements,
are still followed. Schweppes’ products attracted great attention from the Medical
profession in England, and the increase of his business led him to take three Englishmen
into partnership by deed dated 14th May, 1798, under the style of J. Schweppe & Co.
Jacob Schweppe himself retired from active management in 1799, but the partnership

identified with excellence and purity of the Waters supplied. In 1834 the business was
acquired by the father of the present Chairman of the undertaking, the name being

Sydney,
1/th December, 189%.
Helidon Spa Water Co.
Dear Sir,—
The following is analysis of the sample of
your mineral water left with me:—■
Organic Matter . . . . Traces
Oxide of Iron and Alumina Traces
Chloride of Sodium . . 2.99
Carbonate of Sodium .. 212.14
Carbonate of Lithium . . 2.68
Carbonate of Calcium .. 7.35
Carbonate of Magnesium .. 3.39
Silica 0.29
Total . . .. .. 228.84
Total solids on evaporation 233.01
The difference, 4.17, being carbonic acid driven
off on ignition.
This water contains more lithia than any of
the European Spa Waters, except that from the
Murquelle, at Baden Baden, which contains lithia
as chloride, and it is also much richer in car-
bonate of sodium, though Birresborn, in Prussia
and Bilin, in Bohemia, approach it.
This water would be used as an antacid and
diuretic, the latter effect being due to the lithia.
I remain, yours truly,
WILL A. DIXON, f.i.c., p.c.s.
. We now give an explanation of the
virtues of some of the salts which the
water holds in solution:—
Bicarbonate of Lithia. —An alka-
line which has solvent powers on Uric
Acid, forming with it a soluble salt, thus
destroying concretions. Purifies the
blood through the kidneys.
Carbonate of Sodium. —For gouty
and uric acid diathesis. Assists the
action of the biliary organs, checks food
fermentation.
Chloride of Sodium. —A gentle stimu-
lant to the liver and secretions. In-
creases the action of the skin, promoting
perspiration.
In conclusion, we briefly submit that the con-
sumption of Helidon Spa gives health and com-
fort to all who use it. Indigestion is instantly
removed, restlessness gives way to a calm feeling
of tranquillity, a refreshing sleep is often in-
duced, feverish thirst is allayed at once, and
when the water is taken with milk in the morn-
ing, a marked improvement in health will follow.
It must be remembered that no water hitherto
discovered is so retentive of carbonic acid gas,
which makes its persistent and sparkling efferves-
cence more agreeable to the palate, and also
more grateful to the stomach.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Outcast”: The professional cannibals of
the Gulf of Papua baptise their canoes in much the
same way as those of the Solomons (B. 4/6/’l4).
In the Purari Delta, when a new canoe is to be
launched, a cassowary, a pig and a man must be
killed at the launching, and the craft painted with
their blood. The same thing occurs in the Aird
Delta. There is no waste, however. The fresh meat
is passed out to the kitchens and roasted with sago.
The only proviso is that the gentleman who has done
the actual killing is debarred from having a share
of that particular dish, although he can even things
up by eating somebody else’s kill. In the Fly River
the hall mark of fashion for a new canoe is the
addition of two or three “fresh” heads to the usual
gear.
BROTHERS IN MISFORTUNE.
GENT (on left): “Damn the Kaiser !”
GENT ( on right): “D—ash the Kaiser.”
“Alamon”: In the Northern Territory it
is still fairly common for half-caste children to be
eaten; though if the baby survives for a week
there is no more talk of a feast, and the child
takes its chance with other piccaninnies. In common
with most Australian niggers those of the N.T. have
a weakness for the kidney-fat of an enemy—so
pronounced a weakness, that even within the last
ten years two cases of fat-stealing have occurred
within 20 miles of Darwin. But cannibalism in the
N.T. is nearly always a religious ceremony. Cer-
tainly the eating of half-caste children and the
kidney-fat of enemies is -excused on “religious”
grounds—the first to destroy 1 tlebil-debils, the second
to obtain double strength and courage.
“J.R.K.”: I was out with a couple of
blacks (N.Q.) a few days ago, and put some
Prussian culture on to one of the porcupine family.
Presently a strong odor of roast pork pervaded the
atmosphere. It came from the cooked ’pine. After
a lot of yabbering from the abos., I sampled the
basis of the odor. It was not unlike pork, but more
delicate in flavor. The next time The Bulletin is
entertaining visitors, just drop me a line and the
menu shall have something new in game.
“Avis”: The Cape Barren goose is dis-
appearing. He is good eating, and the pot'makes a
poor nest. Being migratory he cannot be preserved
cither. About November he and the missus come to
the continent from their home on an island group
off the Tasmanian coast, where the}' nest amid wild
crags and wilder storms. In the spring, when the
young can fly, the birds are off, striking mainland
about Cape Otway, then making for the plains of the
Victorian central-western district. There they fre-
quent the lakes and marshes, over which they fly
almost as fast as the black duck. Great flocks used
to be seen about Streatham, Lake Bolac, Woorndoo,
Skipton and Cressy. But not now'. Much farther
north there is the more familiar goose, which lays its
eggs on the continent, and high old times Binghi
has had with them.!
* * * ♦
“R. ,T. 8.”: I got hold of the real Mackay
the other day, and it made me feel good to be an
Australian. ’Twas in the hills that lie back of
Morwell (Vie.). Darby and Joan, some 30 years
ago, secured a slice of the range, which Govern-
ment had opened up for selection. Fighting against
droughts, bushfires, floods and other little things,
they made a decent little home by the time they
W'ere, in an ordinary way of speaking, old enough
to have lost all interest in hard yakker. The
couple, however, reckoned they should be doing a
bit more for the family, so they selected a block
further up the range, on a track that would send
cold shivers down the back of a rock wallaby. I
met the old lady when she had just returned from
a Melbourne hospital, after a six-months illness. As
she gazed over across at the sun-touched ridge where
the fire-tortured timber sprawled about in grotesque
attitudes, she spoke of her plans. “There’s a bit
of picking-up to be done over there this summer,
and there’s the gully to be ‘brushed’ again. It
takes a lot of keeping down. But a bit of scrub
isn t going to get the best of us—as long’s we’ve
got health and strength.” The Australian is a
loafer, all right.
* * * *
Lagani-Namo”: Here and there around
Papua and elsewhere among the South Sea Isles
where disc shell money is made, the natives have an
ingenious drilling contrivance. This consists of a
wooden spindle, 20 inches long, tipped with a
splinter of flint, passing through a thin stone or
liaidwood disc 4ft. Gin. in diameter. A rotary motion
is imparted by means of a string attached to the top
and wound spirally down to a cross head which is
worked up and down the spindle above the disc.
Usually the discs are about Jin. in diameter, and as
thick as a sixpenny piece. They are strung in
lengths of from, say, a foot to a fathom, according
to kind. The pink Papuan money is the most valu-
able—practically 10s. per foot. It is made, by the
women of Tatana (Port Moresby) and at Surlest,
hundreds of miles further S.E., from the lip of a
shell resembling in shape and size a Sydney rock
o}ster. Latterly, several Europeans have gone into
this shell-money manufacture, and their up-to-date
methods are gradually driving the other mints out of
the business. On one occasion some enterprising-
white spielers got a lot of composition counterfeit
made in Germany and Birmingham, but the natives
turned the duffers down with indignation and threats
that ended the industry in its uninnocent youth.
* * * *
“Lifeline”: I was lying on jn.v back in
4ft. of water and using my hands as fins. My toes
pi otruded, and I was regarding them placidly when I
noticed a green wall rushing at me. The wall was
gemmed with a bald head bisected by a thick black
moustache. I struggled for a foothold ; but the Manly
backwash was too strong for me. I floundered half-
way between the prostrate and the upright, and next
moment I was buried in sand and water. A log of
wood hit my shoulder and an unshod horse kicked me
in the back and fled. It was three months before I
rose and wiped the ocean from my eyes. I stood with
the Pacific swirling round my chest and plucking at
my legs. I sneezed reflectively and then lay down
again. Far above me a small white cloud sailed across
a field of blue. I was regarding this with pleasure,
when the hind end of an elephant went past me going
seaward. It was the bald gentleman going out to do
it again. My attention was distracted by a pretty
stranger in a green bathing-cap. She looked friendly,
but there was a husband or a brother or something at
the other end of her arm. “Look out!” growled
somebody, and the bald gentleman shot past me in a
smother of foam. Seen from the rear he was another
elephant. A gigantic caterpillar came pouring my
way. I jumped and let it go under my armpits. The
pusher of the moustache floundered past me outward
bound. “Sorry I missed that one!” he grumbled and
jumped suddenly like a frog. His large, fat feet fol-
lowed him pinkily into the g'reen, and I mentally
composed his obituary notice. The ocean had one of
its calm spells, and the heaving carpet of water spread
out flatly while the colored human tacks waited with
their backs towards the shore. The wheeze and
thump of the band on the beach wandered thinly
across the waters before the sea once more gathered
itself together like an old horse coming at a fence
The crashing fall of the first big wave for two
minutes stirred up the people wallowing in the
shallows and momentarily blotted out the ocean
advance guard, now washing itself half-way to Maori-
land. The pretty girl in the green cap was most
upset. Her feet emerged from the water (where she
had been carefully hiding them), and were seen to
be large. The bald gentleman, inward bound once
more, slid beachward like a train, shoving his spark-
ling moustache before him. I noticed that the sun
had got at his arms and cooked them nicely. I
could have made a good imitation of him with a
round of corned beef. Further reflections were cut
short by the ocean, which slapped me heavily on the
back like an old friend and threw salt in my eyes
like a cheerful lunatic. I got them wiped clear again
only to see the usual hind-legs of the usual elephant
making- out to where the breakers came from. I
threw myself on my bed of water, and there was a
sudden chorus of warning shouts. A big wave was
coming! I struggled madly for mv feet, but they
refused to come down to the sand in time. The
white tusks of the wrinkling breaker flashed above
my head, and a projectile thrown by a German siege- •
gun smote me fairly in the chest. The world of sun-
shine was extinguished with a roar, and I fell back-
ward into choking silence with an octopus as big as
a cow fastened firmly to my seven-and-sixpenny bath-
ing suit. After many shots the interminable bald
gentleman had torpedoed and sunk me at last.
“Boronia” : If any Abo-culturist has difti-
culty in getting some of the trees on his fruit ranch
to bear let him try this dodge. Bore an inch hole
about a foot from the ground in the trunk of the
dilatory vegetable, and fill it up by driving in
tightly a piece of dry wood about l-16in. diameter.
After this treatment a fruit tree often becomes alive
to its responsibilities, and realises that its job in life
is to grow fruit, and not merely leaves and timber.
A MODEST REQUEST.
CUTHBERT : “ Well, madam , there's no need of losing your Cemper ver it. It isn't as if
I asked you to prepare an elaborate repast for me. An informal breakfast would
have suited me. Good morning, madam. Good morning."
“Moana”: One of the most remarkable
spots in Maoriland, although it is but little known,
is a place called Curio Bay, down south. When the
tide runs out a visitor has an impression that he has
come upon a submerged forest, for extending right
down to low water-mark (and probably far beyond
it) the beach is dotted with tree-stumps. As a
matter of fact, there is not really a scrap of wood
on that beach, everything there being solid stone.
Evidently away in the forgotten past the sea swal-
lowed up the adjacent bush and promptly began to
turn it into rock. Exactly what has been responsi-
ble for the remarkable petrifying process is not
known. Also, it doesn’t very much matter.
* * * *
“Ivuscobin” : Who says birds don’t reason?
There’s a patch of South African torch-lilies grow-
ing in my garden. I was struck by their beauty
when at the Cape, and brought over a number with
me. Now, I’ve watched the sun-birds in Kaffirland
sucking the lining out of the long flower tubes by
clasping the plant by its stem, just below the
blossom, and then dipping their beaks into the store
of nectar. For a couple of year* the bell-birds
and white-eyes of Maoriland gave the flowers a wide
berth; then one bright morning I discovered a score
of them feasting on the lilies, and they’ve been at it
ever since. The strange thing was that they tackled
the blossoms in exactly the same way as the birds
of South Africa, although there are no M.L, flowers
kin to the torch-lily in shape. Did the feathered
Maoris just reason the way out for themselves, or
did a stray bird arrive from S’Africa to tell them
how ?
* * * *
“Outcast”: I don’t know anything much
about the Fijian yanggona, or kava, as it is called,
but I do know something about gamada (Piper
methysticum ) in Papua, and from what I can learn
from black brother it seems that the chewing of it
is absolutely necessary in order to produce its peculiar
qualities. The drug, or drink, or whatever you call
it, is really more of a stimulant than a narcotic,
and is known and used only in a small district of
Western Papua. It contains a large proportion of
the active principles of cocaine. In Papua it is,
when used ceremonially (and there is a sort of
ceremony attached to its use on certain occasions),
chewed by small boys under the rank of initiates.
The Kiwai, unable to get alcohol, has taken to
gamada with great vigor, and a debauch on it will
breed more snakes than a night or two of “pinky.”
Too much gamada gives a very bad “morning after”
feeling, and continued indulgence produces lasting
effects. During the “jag” the young man on the
spree can’t use his legs, and sweats like the ceiling
of Tophet. In the old days, anxious to keep a good
thing to themselves, only the older men were allowed
to drink gamada, and it was and still is forbidden
to women. I have heard from Fijians and Samoans
that the Papuan variety of the booze is infinitely
stronger than in their parts.
“Wang”: The just-dead Mrs. Lauder, of
South Melbourne, an old-time friend of Gordon’s,
religiously preserved a few relics of the bard. One of
them is a stockwhip alleged to have been made by
him from greenhide. I wielded it the other day, and
as an old hand the weapon appealed to me. It is a
fine bit of work, the handle as well as the thong-
being of the plaited cowskin. Stockmen, as a rule,
are mightily proud of their whips, and Gordon’s
would excite the admiration of the most critical of
them.
“Pick”: The bush-grafter’s notion of
Tophet is a wet jungle full of land-leeches. Ticks,
scorpions and bulldog ants are taken more or less in-
differently ; but against the leech all fortifications
so far invented have proved ineffective. On the axe-
man’s first step into the shadows of a jungle, the
enemy, in regiments, lurches forward to attack him,
and the covering that will keep them out hasn’t been
made. They puncture the skin so delicately that they
are not felt until, over-gorged, their clammy bulk
slides earthwards. Then the menu knows that it has
a troublesome little rivulet of blood to stanch, and an
HIGH JINKS.
P. M.: “What is your name?"
DILAPIDATED FEMALE (who is quite a fre-
quent visitor at court): “ Hangel."
P. M.: “ Where do you come from?"
D.F.: “Heaving."
P. M.: “H’m! How did you get here?"
D.F.: "J ist slithered down a rainbow."
P.M.: “Very good. Three months for sky-
larking."
itching wound. And the rivulet takes some stanch-
ing.' Left to itself, or if you wash it with warm
water, the puncture will ooze blood for 24 hours.
What I haven’t fathomed about these leeches is where
they get to in dry times. Not one can be found
between the Dan and Beersheba of Jungleland then,
but the first shower brings them loping after a
bushman in droves.

THE FLUTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
How kind it is of somebody in the office across the
way
To play a cool and trickling- flute on such a burning
day.
It doesn’t matter about the tune, be it martial music
even,
Or a dreary dirge from a death-bed’s verge on the
thorny way to Heaven,
Or a fairy jig, or a wedding march, or a gloaming-
lullaby,
As long- as the flute like a magic lute scrawls notes
of the sea and sky !
It brings the crest of a high brown cliff, with •
yellowy grasses waving,
And the languid lave of a golden wave the base of
the brown scarp caving:
It brings the sweep of a big, clean sky, a-swim in a
world of summer,
A seagull’s winging to ocean’s swinging, or a polien-
buskined hummer ;
Pink-tipped flowers in dusty grasses, petals thirsty
on dip and lea,
A scent of clover, the landside over, and a moist
wind from the sea!
Now it sings like spume to a jutting rock, and
gurgles in unseen hollows ;
Now it rustles leaves round a cottage eaves, the
haunt cf the darting swallows ;
Now it dies almost, as a breeze’s ghost, in a wood
by the sun forgotten ;
Now it sips in bliss, like a stolen kiss of a clouded
moon begotten ;
Now it sinks to valleys and cries its tale of the
sparkle of reach and breaker,
Where the noon is hot on the garden plot, and fierce
on the lucerne acre!
How kind it is of somebody in the office across the
way
To play a cool and trickling flute on such a burning
day!

“Snell”: It was in Starvers bar. Tim
lialin slouched in and leaned on the door jamb.
He had not shaved this week, his hair suggested a
shearers’ strike, and his clothes —what there were
of them—matched his face. “Will yeh marry, Miss
Carter?” said AVhalin. The new barmaid hit the
bottles more fiercely with her rag duster, and her
back hardened. “I’m sayin’, Miss, most polite,
would yeh be marryin’ me, did I ask yeh?” Miss
Carter did not turn. “This is a pub,” she said,
“not a matrimonial agency.” AVhalin slouched for-
ward, and leant on the bar counter. “ ’Tis small
matter what it is, I’m thilikin’,” said he. “But
presumin' it’s a pub, ’n’ lavin’ other exthraneous con-
siderations out, iv the Question, will yeh marrv wid
me this Chewsdee?” “What’s your drink?” snapped
Mary. “Have it and git.” “I’m a poor wan wid
drink. For the moment ’tis not refreshment I'm
askin. Will yeh be Mrs. Whalin?” “I will not. I
never saw you before.” “You saw me Sathurdav, V
I was here Thursday, ’n’ lasht night, V again t’ day,
n now Im askin’ yeh will you marry wid me?”
Certainly not!” She looked Whalin up and down
disdainfully. “I’m a bit particular what I marry,”
she said. “And ye’d not marry me?” “J would
not. Get work and buy soap.” “ ’Tis the nade iv a
wash, is it?” He returned in half an hour. He had
had bath. “Will yeh marry me now?” said he.
“A woolly goat? Never!” she said. “Is it me bit
iv hair in the way?” said Whalin. He went out
again, and had a hair-cut and shave. Once more
lie appeared before Starver’s new barmaid. “Maybe.
Miss, ye’ll give the matter consideration now,” said
he—“meanin’ the marriage iv the two iv us, one
wid the other?” “I wouldn’t marry such a scare-
crow if there wasn’t another man on earth.” He
looked down at his clothes. “ ’Tis a mighty par-
ticlar woman y’are, Miss Carter.” It was four'before
AVhalin returned, and he was wearing a whole suit
and good boots. “Wanst more,” he said, “will yeh
look me over?” “And why should 1?” she asked
superciliously. “Wid a view to marriage,” said he.
Get out of my bar, she said, “or I’ll have you
arrested for stealing those things, you tramp.” “Then
1 understand you’ll not have me in anny clothes?”
said AYhalin. “ ’Tis a pity yeh put me to the
throuble iv borryin’ me brother’s suit, ’n’ him needin’
it fer Bourke’s funeral.” “The cheek!” she said.
“Thank'you for nothin’, and when I marry it’ll be
with a man who can keep me, not a lurcher. Get
out!” “Tut, tut, tut!” clucked Whalin calmly.
Ye’re the hard girl to a bargain.” He went out,
and did not return till next morning. He was
carrying a canvas bag, which he dumped on the
counter. He waited an hour and a half with exem-
plary patience, and when at length they were alone
he said. “Touchin’ me financial standin’ ’n’ status,
there’s two thousan’ siven hunthred sovereigns in the
bag. ’Tis all I cud dthraw out. But you’d wish t’
count it over, would yeh? Me far-rm beyant is

Lagani-Namo”: Some Papuan peoples
are sooty-black, but most of them are a pale bronze.
The former, instead of tattooing, cicatrise their
skins by way of enhancing their beauty. By con-
tinually removing the scab which forms over these
cuts, a raised weal gradually forms. Onlv the light-
skinned people tattoo. Each village has its own
designs. They are sometimes simply ornamental,
but some are significant of deeds of prowess. The
pattern is first drawn on the skin with an ink made
of soot and a fragrant gum. The subsequent prick-
ing-in is done with a thorn fixed in a stick.

O.C.C. ’: What's your record in thunder-
storms? Also your longest roll of thunder, your
vividest flash of lightning, the size of the biggest
hailstones, and the hugest number of cows or per-
sons struck and killed? My own experience of the
Australian thunderstorm is that it is nearly as unre-
liable as Holman’s policy. Thus, in four years ]
never saw one storm in AV.A.; then, along- came
ihreo in two days. At Katoomba (N.S.W.), since
September this year we have had 28 distinct am!
•more-or-less impressive storms to date, Nov. 20.
'The largest, hailstones I ever saw fell at Leura two
years ago. They were solid, irregular-shaped chunks
of hard ice, thousands of them, as big each as a small
hen-egg; a few ran to duck-egg size. In August,
1902, in Melbourne, a similar phenomenon struck
that city ; it is talked of yet. The first stones that
fell looked like tennis-balls and broke through gal-
vanised-iron roofs. Melbourne Town Hall clock on
the north face suffered severely, while thousands of
glass-houses out Richmond way looked like the

“Boronia”: The Scaddan (W.A.) Govern-
ment is, amongst other things, shy of a sound
forestry policy. An expert from the Indian Forestry
Dept, recently paid a visit to our jarrah and karri
patches and regarded them with an admiring and
contemplative eye which almost burst from its
lunges at the amazing wastefulness of the mills and
cutters. In return for the information that his De-
partment received for teak £l2 10s. per load in the
round, he was assured that the best timber in W.A.
is allowed to go for Is. 6d. per load. Whereat he
collapsed, and had to be fanned with a sleeper. He
now probably regards the West as a huge lunatic
asylum.
“Alainon : If the Commonwealth really
wants to economise in the Northern Territory it
might start by wiping out the Aboriginal- Protectors.
They cost about £6OOO per annum, and don’t protect
worth sixpence. During the three years that the
Territory has known them white and Asiatic high-
livers have found lubras just as easy to obtain as
ever; half-caste children have been murdered at
birth as of yore; opium and grog have been child-
ishly easy for the blacks to obtain ; and those who
offered respectable employment to Bing-hi have found
the utmost difficulty in securing him. The recipe for
getting Binghi as an employee is not i> lie’s capacity
to offer him a decent job, but the fact of being a
personal pal of one of the protectors. Tn all the
circumstances I hold them dear at the sum they are
costing.

bas just been destroyed by the adventure
of my poor brother-in-law. He was visiting
an adjacent suburb the other Monday, when a large,
frantic woman rushed out of the side gate of a pale-
blue cottage. She had nothing on but a few imag-
inary parasites bred of rum. My brother-in-law
instantly stripped off his overcoat (new for this
winter) and enveloped the suburban Godiva, and
passed her into the care of a man who had exuded
from the same gateway. The man towed the woman
indoors, and my poor brother-in-law waited at the
gate for his overcoat. He waited 20 minutes, and
then assailed the front door. He assailed it for a
quarter of an hour, and there was no response. He
went to the back door, and pounded there for
another 10 minutes. Then a head bobbed up over
the dividing fence, and a kind “lydy” said: “If you
want your overcoat, mister, you better see the p’lice.

Ben was good enough to restore the pawn ticket.
THE HONORED DEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wandered in the graveward where
1 lie white stones stared beneath the sun,
And saw a simple fellow there,
Arranging pebbles one by one
To make a cross upon a mound.
With blooming daisies set around,
Tlie grave was all so neatly kept,
The kneeling man so full of pains,
, t seemed to me a husband wept
Above a wife’s beloved remains ;
And as I stopped his work to view,
I spake with him a word or two.
Oh, no, ’twas not his wife, he said,
Mho lay below, for ever still;
It was a bloke, and he was dead,
And furthermore his name was Bill.
“There’s none I know” (his eye was dim)
“Could strop a razor blade like him !”

RITA MOYA discourses on
NATURAL BEAUTY,
and how to obtain it.
To-day every woman of taste and refinement avoids the use of cosmetics or made-up
toilet preparations which give an artificial appearance. The fresh, natural complexion that
few women have, and every woman desires, is best obtained by use of original ingredients
already at hand or which can be obtained from any reliable chemist. My advice is to avoid
the use of most made-up face creams, rouge and beautifying preparations. They are usually
obvious and often disappointing. If you will get only the proper original ingredients you will
be satisfied with the result. Insist on having what you ash for. If the chemist does not
happen to have it in stock, he can immediately get it from his wholesaler.
Good Shampoo Important.— The hair should
be allowed to breathe, and the greasy film
around each strand must be removed with a
mild non-alkaline shampoo. Soaps should be
tabooed. The very best solution for the pur-
pose can he made by dissolving a teaspoonful
of stallax granules in a cup of hot water. It
stimulates the scalp to healthy action, and at
the same time leaves the hair in that soft,
fluffy condition so much admired. Any chemist
can supply you with an original packet of
stallax, sufficient to make 25 or 30 shampoos.
Magic for Superfluous Hair. —It is astound-
ing the number of women who suffer from
unsightly growths of hair on the face, and it
will come as a piece of good news to know
that there is a simple substance known as
powdered pheminol which will remove it im-
mediately and permanently. Mix a small
quantity into a thin paste with a little water,
and apply to the objectionable growths. In
two minutes all trace of the hair will have
entirely vanished, and your skin will be as
soft and smooth as a child’s.
To have Smooth, White Skin all through the
Winter. —Does your skin chap or roughen
easily, or become unduly red or blotchy? Let
me tell you a quick and easy way to over-
come the trouble and keep your complexion
beautifully white, smooth and soft. Just get
some ordinary mercolised wax at the chem-
ist’s, and use a little before retiring as you
would use cold cream. The wax, through
some peculiar action, flecks off the rough, dis-
colored or blemished skin. The worn-out
cuticle comes off just like dandruff on a dis-
eased scalp only in almost invisible particles.
Mercolised wax simply hastens Nature’s
work, which is the rational and proper way to
attain a perfect complexion, so much sought
after, but very seldom seen. The process is
perfectly simple and quite harmless.
Tor Dry, Irritating and Dandruffy Scalps.
• —Nothing can compare with the following
recipe for the above condition, and until you
have rectified any trouble in this direction it
is useless to expect the hair to grow healthy
and vigorous. Mix a package of boranium
with J-pint of bay rum, shake the bottle well
and allow to stand for 30 minutes, then add
i-pint cold water and strain. This simple
home remedy will stimulate the hair roots to
their normal functions, resulting in a beauti-
ful growth of new hair.
Rouge Not Necessary.—lf you must add a
little color to the cheeks please do not use
rouge; it is always so painfully obvious that
women of refinement have now discarded it
for ever. There is a little-known substance
called colliandum obtainable at most chem-
ist’s, which can be used in its place. It gives
a perfectly natural tint and defies the closest
scrutiny, besides having the undoubted ad-
-vantage of not rubbing off.
The Powder Puff Passes.—A persistently
shiny nose, or a dull, lifeless complexion
drives many a woman to cosmetics and conse-
quent despair. And all the time a simple
remedy lies at hand in the home. Get from
your chemist about an ounce of cleminite,
and add sufficient water to dissolve it. A
little of this simple lotion is Nature’s own
beautifer. It is very good for the skin and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lasts all day or evening, renders powdering
entirely unnecessary and absolutely defies
detection.
Miscellaneous Hints. —For lips inclined to be
rough or harsh use a soft stick of prolactum.
An ideal complexion soap is one called
pilenta. It contains no free alkali, and is as
near neutrality as science can make it.
To make the eyelashes grow long, dark and
curling, massage them gently with mennaline.
It is quite a harmless substance, and will not
injure the eyes.

“Milmeridien”: The American fraud of
teaching impossibilities by post is making
great headway in Australia, where at least
one correspondence college now advertises
its ability to train people to write short
stories they can sell. Says the advt.
If you have a vivid imagination, and the powers
of observation fully developed, you possess natural
talent for short-story writing, and all you need is
training to earn guineas with your pen.
If any man thinks he can teach another how
to live on story writing lie’s a fool, and if
he says he can without thinking he can he’s
a rogue. A knowledge of human nature—
which only ourselves can teach ourselves—
is not mentioned in the advt., nor is the
necessity for a vocabulary mentioned either.
The storywriter is not made by anybody;
he is born, and after that he makes himself
It’s up to me to advertise offering to teach
anybody the topography of the moon in six
lessons by telegraph. I know nothing of the
moon, and it probably hasn’t any topo-
graphy ; but little difficulties like that shall
not put me out of business.
“H. 0.”: “Y.Z.” (B. 19/11/14) objects
to black-and-white artists giving us war pic-
tures of “horsemen tearing athwart the land-
scape,” because in these days “war is more
a matter of deep calling unto deep.” Is it?
It seems to me, a boarding-house war-
expert of several months’ standing, that one
of the most remarkable features of the dis-
turbance is the quantity of in-fighting. The
German siege guns did a certain amount of
damage to the Liege forts and the architec-
ture of Rheims, but the really deadly scrap-
ping has taken place in trenches, sometimes
so close that the opposing forces could ex-
change insults, and dozens of important
positions have been carried by cavalry
charges. No modern war has yielded so
many picturesque melees, and Caton Wood-
ville in his finest frenzy could not do justice
to them.

The owner of a suburban garage, while
speeding on one of the fleetest of his cars,
was challenged by an armed sentry, near
Sydney, the other evening. His cut-out was
working, he failed to hear the challenge, and
the sentry shot him. The episode recalls
an offer made lately to ex-Australian Fred
Leist by the London Graphic. The money
was very big indeed; the accessories were
two motor-bikes ; and the duty was to ride
on the bike which was not being repaired,
from _ the Flanders coast to the front, do a
drawing, and rush back again. Leist, with
the far-ranging vision of the artist, foresaw
the armed sentry, the challenge drowned in
the inferno of the cut-out, the very prob-
able corpse, and he turned the offer down.

A long wrangle between the two morning
papers in Wellington (M.L.) has come to an
end. When the big waterside strike was on
The Dominion (Tory) went baresark in
accusing the strikers of sedition, tearin’-me-
uniform and assorted wickedness, and asso-
ciated The Times with the villainy. The
Times scorned the allegation and asked its
loathed contemporary for heavy damages for
libel. At the hearing the jury disagreed,
despite the squadron of eminent wigs en-
gaged to make things clear. Then the job was
started afresh, and again the jury could not
make up its mind. In despair, the news-
papers caane to an amicable settlement. The
Dominion undertaking to assure The Times
that its rejmarks were of quite a friendly
nature, and regretting that any person should
have thought otherwise. To prove its sorrow
it hands over a purse of sovereigns to that
gluttonous and incapable party, Costs. If
there had been less horse-tail and more horse-
sense in the first place, Costs would hardly
have been mentioned.

S. Australia’s new llansaro staff has
finished its first session amid compliments—
such as those of Chief Secretary Bice, who
called the results “magnificent.” Before this
year the daily papers took it in turns to
contract for Hansard. Th<} new combina-
tion is headed by Sincock (previouslv of the
Advertiser) as director, with Fred .Johns
and Cockburn (both Register) as leader
and assistant-leader. In, practice, Johns is
mostly responsible for the Assembly,
Cockburn for the Council, and Sincock for
the many Committees and Commissions.
* * * ■*
London Times (Id.) .made a profit last
year of only £6072, or f/13,499 less than in
the previous 12 months, when the price was
twopence. Daniel Disraeli Braham, lately
a director of, the Times, will have to do a
lot better than that for the Sydney Tele-
graph or there will be a row.' The Tele-
graph’s profit last year was £49,795, and
£56,892 in. the year at the back of that.
Mrs. Jeanne F. Young, secretary of the
Effective Voting League in South Aus., and
chief exponent of this system of Parliamen-
tary ballot, writes an occasional political
leading article for the Adelaide Register,
Her husband, A. H. Young, is a valued mem-
ber of the editorial staff of the Advertiser,
the opposition journal, and does most of the
reviews for Langdon Bonython’s paper, with
which he has been connected for 30 years
or more. Mrs. Young was an intimate
friend of that brilliant woman and reformer,
the late Catherine Helen Spence, who left
her the effective voting campaign as a
political legacy.

“The Oldest” : An ancient Australian prin-
ter little heard of now was Arthur Hill, who
published Hill’s Life in New South
Wales in 1832. Its price was 5s. per quarter.
Said the prospectus: “It will be left to the
elder journals to teach philosophy and deep
politics. Hill’s will give the politics of the
Mother Country and the colony in the way of
narrative and fact rather than discussion.
Trials which afford amusement as well as
information will be fully reported. It will
comprise chiefly matters of amusement. His
Excellency having sanctioned the opening of
a theatre in Sydney, a space in Hill’s Life
will be set apart for a correct report of the
amusements of the house. Select and original
poetry, particularly of a humorous kind, will
occupy a first place.” By way of starting
the humor there was a poem on “The
Printer”
Who is it, gentle reader, who,
That labors hard on pleasing you,
By telling all that's strange and new,
And very often what’s untrue?
The Printer.
The paper lasted six months, and then was
absorbed by the Weekly Observer, and
within a year the founder was dead. In the
old Sydney Sandhills Cemetery stood a stone
with the inscription :—
To the Memory of Arthur Hill, Printer, of Sydney.
Died March 22, 1834. Aged 50 years.

“O’Phimerty”: The first newspaper in
Tasmania was The Derwent Star and
Van Diemen’s Land Intelligencer,
started by Governor Collins in 1810. It ran
only a few weeks. Though only a quarto
leaf with a broad margin, it found local
stories scarce and filled out with weird items
from all over the world. It contained this
first press notice of a Tasmanian wedding:
“On Monday, 26th ult., R. C. Burrows to
Elizabeth Tucker, both late of Norfolk
Island. They had cohabited together 14
years, verifying at last the old adage—better
late than never.”

“Nemo”: Moving-picture producers per-
sistently misrepresent pressmen. Whenever
an unfortunate scribe has to be dragged into
one of their productions he is always shown
taking voluminous notes in a ledger or day-
book of most uninteresting occurrences. In
real life notebooks are discarded in the earli-
est cub-days. After that any old piece of copy
paper is good enough. Sometimes sparse
notes are scribbled on the back of a washing
bill or the space dt the bottom of the letter
sent by the .young man’s most popular bar-
maiden. Stiff cuffs made an excellent sub-
stitute for copy paper, but they are not in
vogue these days. Thank Heaven, stiff linen
collars are left to us. If you are suddenly
put on to a job where it is imperative to
take notes, off with your double collar, take
the notes, replace the millinery at the close
of the job, then return to the office to write
up your story with the main points of it
securely fastened round, your neck.

“Pica De Vinne” : The Egotist, of Port
Lincoln, was the fourth paper published in
South Aus. The previous ones were the
South Australian Gazette, Colonial
Register, and Southern Advertiser. The
motto of The Egotist (“’Tis I”) was evi-
dently adapted from the late W. Shakspeare’s
“Hamlet.” The production was of four
pages, each carrying three columns, 12 inches
long; price, 2/6 per copy. Ads. under six
lines were charged £ 1 Is. per insertion;
every additional line Is. extra. The first
number was published on May 14, 1839.
After a few issues dissension broke out and
the paper ceased publication. The editorial
remarks of the first issue were as follow:
“We unblushingly proclaim that we are an
Hireling Press, retained at an enormous
salary by Charles Smith—at the present
time the best-abused man in the Province. He
is answerable for all we write. At the
same time we are not his serfs and bound to
do his bidding. We will not write him up.
We only consider ourselves bound to prevent
others from unjustly crying him down. If
ever (and we hope we never shall) we find
him in the wrong, we resign the editorship of
this paper. As regards our political creed
our motto will be: ‘Fear God, honor the
Queen, have charity to all men.’” Charlie
Smith had a monopoly over the paper, for
no news of any kind was contained therein
without reference to that “best-abused”
gentleman. After the Egotist passed into
oblivion. Port Lincoln was without a paper
for 60-odd years.

AT SEA.
TFor The Bulletin.]
The hawsers and ropes flap noisily against the
masts.-— Finn writing in Melb. Age of voyage of
Expeditionary transport.
The hawser flaps against the mast,
The rudder’s high and dry ;
And, safely garnered in "the past,
The water-smoke sweeps by.
Hey! my jolly, jolly boys,
We know a sailor’s joys,
When the anchor’s in the cabin and the tempest tears
the sky.
The cable-chain is round the screw,
The decks yield to the blast;
Down under hatches, me and you
Make the winch snug and fast;
H<»y! my jolly, jolly boys,
Who can sing a sailor’s joys
Till the anchor’s in the funnel and the hawser bangs
the mast!
Victoria. DOG-WATCH.
MUTILATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Blathers, M.P., blithers,
Or reverend persons spout,
We take our noted records
And have to wrestle out
The meaning of the tangle,
And what it’s all about.
The “er’s” we never mention;
We fix the erring phrase,
Insert the “h” omitted,
And doctor, many ways,
The tangle of the verbiage—
And yet we get no praise!
For Blathers seeks his paper,
And, turning o’er the page,
He reads with satisfaction
The things that, I’ll engage,
He did not say, but meant to ;
Then flies into a rage.
Declares he’s misreported,
And damns us six times dead,
Tearing, at various moments,
His paper and his head,
Because, perchance, we mentioned
Something he really said!
We have to bear their malice,
Keeping our feelings dark.
But we some mighty speakers
Would for all ages nark
If papers would but publish
What really they remark!

No one can tell exactly what a headache portends. It may be
indigestion: the beginning of brain-fag, or worse, but the first
cause is always the same —a disorder of the blood vessels and
nerves in the head.
For immediate relief of the first cause take Chamberlain’s
Tablets for the stomach and liver. They act quickly on the stomach,
liver and bowels and relieve the whole blood system, thus letting
the nerves “down a peg” and giving rest to the brain.
You get up in the morning rested, refreshed, and filled with
healthy energy after taking

THE DOCTOR’S DECREE
Prevention is better than cure—therefore if you would avoid disease, have
the Preventive always at hand.
Hycol
Disinfectant
is the most powerful known. The admixture of a very little Hycol with
water makes a strong disinfectant solution in which
germs cannot live therefore its great importance
as a preventive of infectious diseases.
Hospitals and Institutions, &c., as a matter of
course, use Hycol, for it is their safeguard and a
necessary part of their equipment. Do not let
disease overtake you—meet and combat it by always
having Hycol at hand.
Hycol is NON-POISONOUS, NON-IRRITANT,
and is TWENTY TIMES STRONGER as a germ-
killer than Carbolic Acid,

PRACTICAL PRESCRIPTION AGAINST
STOMACH ACIDITY.
BY A SPECIALIST.
“Nine-tenths of all cases of stomach
trouble nowadays,” says a leading specialist,
“are caused by too much acid. In the be-
ginning the stomach itself is not diseased,
but if this acid condition is allowed to con-
tinue the acid is very likely to eat into the
stomach walls and produce stomach ulcer or
cancer, either of which may render a radical
surgical operation necessary, even to pro-
long life. Therefore an ‘acid stomach’ is
really a dangerous condition, and should
be treated seriously. It is utterly useless to
take pepsin and ordinary stomach tablets.
The excess acid must be neutralised by the
administration of an efficient antacid. For
this purpose physicians nearly always re-
commend taking half a teaspoonful of
bistirated magnesia in a little water after
each meal. Large quantities may be used if
necessary, as it is absolutely harmless. But
be sure to get the bisurated magnesia, as
other forms of magnesia have not the same
action in the stomach as the bisurated, and
frequently do more harm than good.”*
A Simple Recipe for Clearing
the Complexion.
Exposure to hot winds and sun makes tlio
nerves and muscles of the face tired and life-
less. and the skin shrivelled, wrinkled and
unhealthy.
If anyone with a sallow, blotchy, wrinkled
or pimply complexion will only take a little
trouble in following the directions here given
they will find a marvellous improvement in
their complexion. Get some Puritol Wax
from the chemist or draper, and apply at
night, washing off in the morning with warm
water and soap. Then lap a little cold
water 10 times upon the face with the hands,
allowing it to get thoroughly round the
closed eyes. The treatment should be fol-
lowed out in every detail to ensure success,
and undoubtedly accounts for many of the
clear complexions so much admired by those
who do not yet know the secret. See that
you get the right kind, it wall not injure the
most delicate complexion.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
A FALLING STAR.
FATHER MARTIAN: “ What ho, my son, the
planet Kaiser seems like to lose his contact
with the earth."
SON MARTIAN : “Let us to our halls then,
father, and prepare a banquet for his
reception .”
FATHER : "N ay, my son, what the earth can-
not stomach WE have no room for."
Hugh Mahon is titularly assistant-Minister
for External Affairs, but he is really all the
Minister there is. Arthur, of Bendigo, who
rose to high Cabinet rank after but a year
or so in Parliament, has been too ill ever
since the elections to be even sworn in. Ilis
trouble is a bad heart affection.
. In the idle South Australian lobbies they
are already naming the Labor Cabinet which
will appear after the elections next March :
Crawford Vaughan as Premier and Treas-
urer ; “Jack” Verran, Blundell, Coneybeer or
Derry, in the House of Assembly; and A. W.
Styles, with .T. I*. Wilson or J. 11. Vaughan,
of the Legislative Council. Harry Jackson
will be Speaker.
“Ricardo”: 1 hope I’m no curmudgeon:
yet I assert positively that the marriage of
recruits for this war ought not to be allowed.
A heap of girls are freezing on to soldiers to
get national allowance as wives or widows.
If is said that over 200 of these marriages
have occurred in Melbourne alone —say 1000
all over Australia. Is it not an imposition V
In any case, Australia will growl, over the
taxation. Don’t let us exaggerate it by hav-
ing to maintain a lot of girls—cunning girls
in some cases —as wives through the war, or
•as pensioners through their widowed lives.
- These are the last lots of votes, polled
for Indi. taking that: Vic. Federal district as
an example:--
Federal Election.
Liberal ..14,900
Labor ..15,519

The inference is that Laborites ■ were too
tired or too uninterested in “State” affairs
to go and vote, or the financial feats of State
Labor Premiers Scaddan and Holman have
stunned them; or the insignificance of
“State” Labor representatives, as compared
with Federal, has choked off the more
democratic Liberals and unorganised Labor-
ites. Anyhow, there is the problem for
Labor to think over. It ought to have
gained three of the five seats comprised, in
Indi, and it didn’t win one.
“Melb” throws ink at a fetich
Like many another, Dennistoun Wood, lately dead in
Tasmania, was never tired of expatiating on the
superior intellectual calibre of Parliaments in his
time. He flourished in Victoria amid Aspinall, Berry.
Chapman, Evans, Francis, Fellows, Gillies, Grant,
Gray, Duffy, Haines, Heales, Don, Higinb'otham, Ire-
land, Langton, Lalor, M‘Culloch, Nicholson, Micliie,
Owens, O’Shanassy, Service, Sladen, E.' Syme and
Verdon. To be sure, the present calibre is not like
that. But calibre isn’t everything. We can admire
the calibre of the German guns. But that’s no good
to us. What side is the gun on? That’s what counts.
Before payment of members our Parliaments consisted
almost wholly of “the gentry’’—intellectual, perhaps ;
literary, maybe ; but knowing little of the hard things
of life. So they juggled away the public lands and
left that reform as well as Protection to come from
men who had been too busy thinking" to remember a
few superfluous aitches.
With Labor on top in the Federal Par-
liament, and a Liberal Government offering
the democracy the head of the Leg. Council
on a tin dish, the Argus is even more
out of it all than the Age was a
couple of years back. The Leg. Coun-
cil is its only hope, the one rock
casting a little shade in a blasted
land; yet the Argus must mother
Peacock’s Government, and help to
hatch its legislative eggs like the
hapless duck that hatched the eggs of
the rattlesnake only to be bitten to
death by its own foster family.
N. S. Wales sowed wheat on
20,488 farms last season, and 3682
of them report a total and 5303 a
partial failure. The worst disaster
was in the Central-west plains, which
run out from Yass and Dryberra
towards the sunset, and in the River-
ina ; but even in the coastal district
there was more or less starvation in
three farms out of 10, on the north-
ern tableland in eight farms out of
100, and on the central tableland in
nine farms out of 100. There was,
in fact, but one district in
which there was no failure to
speak of —a district in which all
the sorts of failures, including the
very partial species, ran to only 2
per cent. And that, of course, was
the southern tableland, where the
Monaro is and the Australian capital
ought to be —and would be if the
greedy Sydney importer hadn’t
pulled the strings in favor of a back-
yard capital with one hand while he
manipulated his German invoices
with the other.
The crowd that accused Britain of forcing
Germany to go to war gets a smack in the
mouth from Maximilian Harden’s German
“radical” journal, the Future :
Let us drop these mistaken attempts to excuse Ger-
many’s action....We willed it. We do not stand
before the judgment seat of Europe?. We acknowledge
no such jurisdiction. Our might shall create a new
law in Europe. . . . Her object is to hoist her flag on
the channel which opens and closes the way to the
Atlantic. When this is done she will voluntarily close
the war.
The Bulletin took up the same attitude
once. It was a good while ago, and it had
just stolen a hat-full of tigs. The man who
owned the garden was big and hairy and
most objectionable, and he filled up the only
convenient way out. The Bulletin assured
him that, having taken the figs, it closed the
incident. It is scarcely credible, yet it is
painfully true, that the big, hairy and most
objectionable man laughed and proceeded to
recover the figs and use violence of an un-
mentionable character.
The Fisher Government’s new tariff
Proves to be merely a slightly increased
revenue scoop. The Government hates to
seriously reduce imports because the duties
on them yield income. It takes no stock
of the outstanding fact that Australia is
importing so much more than it can pay
for that it is only by borrowing £23,000.000
or more per year abroad that it prevents
the country being drained of its last shilling
in payment for United States boots and
similar sundries, while all these millions’
worth of work and wages and population
are lost to the country. The increases
proposed aren’t even sufficient to balance
the. rise of wages since the last tariff was
devised. The Australian is amazingly
careful to adjust the weights every year
for the bob-tailed moke in the Melbourne
Cup. but the adjustment of the weights
as between high-priced industry here and
the low-priced article elsewhere he regards
as a matter of no real importance. What
the case calls for is a Bill of one clause
which will raise all duties 100 or 200 per
cent. —small discrepancies to be argued
about later on.
The little people of the Melbourne City
Council managed to maul a gun of the
Greater Melbourne armament the other day.
The Greater Melbourne Council that must
come is certain to find a more distant site
for stockyards and abattoirs; but the dying
City Council is doing its best to make
removal so expensive that it will be delayed
for reasons of cost. Last week the Council
voted £Bl,OOO for “improvements” to the
abattoirs which are misplaced. Of this
amount £13,000 is to be spent immediately,
and the other £68,000 would be, too, only
the Council is short of money.
AT THE MARCH FAST.
HE : "Chawming sight — what?"
SHE: “ Aren't they lovely! If I were only a man I'd be wilh them, wouldn’t you?"
The war hasn’t reached Britain’s own
territory, so that country has had better
luck than Belgium, France, Servia, Russian
Poland or Austria. Still there is a certain
amount of excitement, as witness this state-
ment of the position :
The new British regulations for the defence of the
realm are contained in a Consolidating Act which
was published lust night. This Act gives the
Admiralty and the Army Council virtual power to
abrogate all the ordinary liberties of the subject, and
invests the authorities with absolute powers to do
whatever they think necessary for defence.
All rights to private property disappear for the
time being, and the leaders of the defence forces are
empowered to commandeer any land, buildings, fac-
tories, workshops, and to send the inhabitants to any
particular district.
The rights of jury trial cease, and courts-martial
are empowered to inflict upon any civilian the death
penalty, penal servitude, or a lesser punishment.
Those cheery folk who hung up the construc-
tion of an Australian warship at Cockatoo
Dock, Sydney, with a demand for double
wages for night work haven’t struck the
Real Thing yet.
A HINT TO THE OLD FIRM.
Practically the whole of the drugs, medicines and
materials have been made in Australia. Some ner-
vous people feared at the outset that the withdrawal
of such great quantities of medical supplies would
leave a serious shortage in the Commonwealth. This
has not been the case. Many articles had never
before been made in Australia. The authorities pay
a warm tribute to the splendid manner in which the
druggists Of the Commonwealth proved their capa-
city and resourcefulness when this supreme, unprece-
dented demand was made upon them.
—News item from Melbourne daily.
AUSTRALIA (to one of the firm): "Don't you
think it's about time you took down that
old sign of yours?”
The trouble about General de Wet is that
it is hardly possible, with any semblance of
logic, to hang him without also hanging Sir
Edward Carson.
The leading feature of the Australian
financial statement is that the deficit of the
year will be £13,088,315. Of this £11,742,050
is war expenditure and £1,346,265, the re-
sult of a general failure to make ends meet.
Getting down to details the current revenue
is expected to be £23,273,000 and the current
expenditure £37,583.715. The gap is to be
filled by the exhaustion of the old surplus,
by the issue of Treasury bills, and by a huge
loan from Father Bull in London.
The Gleu Huntly (Vic.) branch of the
P.L.C. has embodied its latest idea in this
resolution:—
That it be a recommendation to the lion, the
Minister of Defence that with a view to democratising
the citizen army the early inauguration of a system
of electing officers is desirable.
There is a democracy of a sort about the
idea; but, with a system of popular elec-
tion, what chance would Glen Iluntly give
a cold manipulator like Kitchener of getting
at the head of affairs? In the best of all
possible worlds, the selection of every sort
of official might safely be left to the crowd.
In a world that is no better and wiser than
it ought to be, the crowd is likely never to
know the men who are best fitted for more
than half the jobs that have to be done. In
fact, the men wouldn’t be the best fitted if
they were the sort that a crowd knows and
loves to listen to.
Orange Snowball, M.L.A. (Vic.), full of
election-pride, said “he hoped in the coming
Parliament men would be found sufficiently
numerous to restore to our children that
priceless heritage, the Bible; for he
trembled to think what would be the result
were the giving of Bible teaching in State
schools much longer delayed.” Puffball,
who. “trembles to think of the result” of
continuing to bar Bible education in State
schools, might, while he is waiting, note the
effect of Bible-edueation on Wilhelm 11.
The Fool of Prussia said recently: “When
I have to make any decision, I ask myself
what the Bible would teach me to do. in
that particular case. It is to me the
fountain from which I draw light and
strength.” . With this example before him,
Snowball is now requested to tremble so
much that lie will look like shivery grass in
a topsail breeze.
OUR CHANGE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our chance is now. If tbe woollen industry in the
eastern United States were made to rely largely upon
Australian wool, their interests would be strongly
against the re-imposition of a duty on wool. — 1\ f.
Quinn, assistant N.S.W. Commissioner in the U.S.
Quick, friends ! An opportunity is fleeting,
A glorious chance which we should not allow
To pass unnoticed, like some mothers’ meeting—
Our chance is now!
This world-wide war, in some respects so baneful,
Has caused a slump in wool, the Lord knows how!
But, if we re smart, that slump may be made gain-
ful—
Our chance is now!
The ne'er-to-be-enough-be-rated Teuton
Can’t get our wool (and serve him right, the
cow!) ;
Let us refuse to longer help the brute on—
Our chance is now!
For years and years our wool we’ve been exporting
The t atherland’s huge factories to endow,
While our best energies have turned to sporting—
Our chance is now!
V hat s that?. . . .Oh, dear, no !. . . .We could never
use it,
Or manufacture—all that talk’s pow-wow.
Besides, our export trade—we mustn’t lose it!
Our chance is now!
The German market’s gone ; but over yonder
Our Uncle Ham is kicking up a row
Because he can’t get wool; so let us ponder—
Our chance is now!
Now is the time, as Nielsen’s junior tells us,
To face the future with unruffled brow,
And buy from Uncle Ham all he can sell us—
Our chance is now!
It may be true that in the States United
Our wool's made up by Ilogstein and his frau.
But what of that ? I'm sure we’re all delighted :
Our chance is now!

SOFTENING THE BLOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A defeated candidate for the Victorian Parliament,
an ex-member, complains that an elector, “probably
in derision,” has sent him a cage of young cockatoos.
Derision, is’t ? Let’s try the feat
Of reading latent meaning in it.
A member sad has lost his seat
Although he tried again to win it.
He gets next day, from “Lord-knows-who,”
A matronly old cockatoo,
With fiery eye and strident tongue
And half a dozen of her young.
No, not derision! We can see
The act in generous relation.
Here’s comfort for the late M.P.
In his pathetic isolation.
For while the cockies screech and hiss
His late companions he’ll not miss.
By killing one a day, the whim
Will gently break his loss to him.

ROZELLE LADY RECOMMENDS DR.
MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS AS AN
EXCELLENT REMEDY.
Mrs. Hannah Donoghue, 9 Catherine
Street, Rozelle, writes: “I am a firm believer
m Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for Rheu-
matics. At times I have been affected in the
arms, wrists and muscles, and know that
your remedy is what I need to dispel any
likelihood of an attack on the slightest pre-
monition or symptom appearing. They seem
to rehabilitate the system, and I would never
be without them. This is my experience
after taking a dose or two of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. In fact, I recommend
them to my neighbors and friends. You have
my consent to use this testimony for publi-
cation.”
Rheumatism is generally regarded as one
of the most difficult ailments to relieve, but
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have been
wonderfully successful by driving the poison
out of the blood, and restoring the joints to
their original suppleness.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
This is apparently the attitude (con-
densed) of N.S.W. Premier Holman in regard to the
totalizator: —•
(1) That it must not be considered, because it
wasn’t put in a definite form on the party programme,
though anything else that wasn’t on the programme
may be considered.
(2) That the majority of the people are in favor
of it, but that in this case the opinion of the majority
doesn't matter.
(.3) That the money which the tote would vield to
the Treasury wouldn’t help the Treasury, no matter
how badly it wants money. (N.B. —Any other money
would help the Treasury.)
(4) That it is “a forgotten subject,” though why
a forgotten subject should cause so much fuss and
have the support of the majority of the people it is
lnii'd to say.
(5) That “something must have happened” to
cause a sudden movement in support of the Social-
istic tote. At the same time nothing special has
happened to cause any sudden desire to support the
Private Enterprise bookmaker.
(6) That no one supports the tote unless he has
“good reasons” for doing so. (Presumably, as
Holman opposes the machine, and can hardly class
himself as a person with bad reasons, he is indulging
in bitter irony, and means that the supporters of the
tote have been corrupted by the insensible and non-
existent implement.)
(7) At the same time, though the bookmaker is
alive and rich and wide-awake, and, presumably no
more scrupulous than other forms of Private Enter-
prise, nothing is said about any form of suspicion
resting upon his supporters. Their unbounded purity
is taken for granted.
It seems to be a case of Begging the Question.
The 1915 Sydney racing fixtures have
been split between A.J.C. (14), Roseliill (13),
Moorefield, Warwick Farm and Canterbury (nine
each), Tattersall’s Club (four), and Hawkeshurv
and City Tattersall’s (two each). The list takes up
every Saturday throughout the year, and also eight
public holidays. This war’s playing up H—l!

There are 11 licensed racecourses within
40 miles of Sydney, and, outside the 40-miles’ limit,
507 licenses have been issued in N. S. Wales for
horse-racing, pony-racing and trotting on 387 courses
for the year. All that the Government gets out of
it, in the absence of the tote, is £1221. McNoses’s
revenue is estimated to be slightly higher.

YY eights for Sydney’s principal summer
races were declared last week. The A.J.C. runs the
Villiers Stakes (one mile) on December 19, and the
Summer Cup (one mile five furlongs) on December
26. _ Tattersall's Club will decide its six-furlong
Carrington Stakes on' December 30, and its mile-
and-a-half T. C. Cup on January 1. 1915. For the
Villiers the following little bunch mav supply the
place-getters: Murringo (6st. 71b.), Tofua (Bst.),
Allaru (fist. 91b.), Tmshi (7st. 111 b.). Giru (7st.
111 b.), Chid (7st, 111 b.). The Summer Cup entrants
that read best this week are Murringo (fist 71b )
Allingam ite (6st. 131 b.), Attora (7st. 1111,.) —if
brought from Victoria, Lochano (Bst. lib.), Posin-
atus (9st.), Alured (9st. 51b.), Sir Vive (fist. 101 b.).

One of the best-known hardicappers in
Australasia is J. E. Henrys, of Maoriland. The
recently-run M.L. Cup was the 24th for which ho
had fixed the weights, "and the big. meeting was one
of the most satisfactory from a handicapping point
of view that the governing club lias had.

The men’s competitions for the Dunn
Challenge Shield were commenced in Sydney on
Saturday, but had nothing very attractive to offer,
except perhaps the pace of F. Madelev, of the South
Sydney Club. He cut out the lOOvds.' in to 1-lOsec.,
and the quarter in 53see. On the day, South Sydney,
holders of the shield, had a lead of five points.
* * * *
The sleeker sex is moving into the
athletic arena with more boldness yearly. She rows
as a professional or amateur, shoots at the butts,
boxes (there’s a more or less authenticated yarn
that in Sydney women have fought for money for the
delectation of blasiS bookies and others—kept very
quiet, of course), plays cricket, billiards (for a
crust, in some instances), hockey, tennis, golf, bowls,
is not afraid to tackle swimming and diving records,
and runs and walks for side-wagers or prizes, or
both. And now, at Ballarat, sister has had a mount
m a handicap pony race.
To keep right in the fashion with brother she
wrangles at her council board, and sets clique
against clique. Just at present the N.S.W. Ladies’
Amateur Athletic Association is calling each other-a
cat in connection with nominations for events at the
Dunn Shield meeting held on Saturday at Svdney.
There were two races for women—BBo-vds. walking
championship of Australia and 100yds. sprint cham-
pionship. The former was won liv Miss White in
smin. 7see. and the latter bv Miss Mace (she was
also third in the walk) in 124 sec.

Miss Atkinson has been granted a license
by the Victorian Trotting Association to ride at its
fixtures. She is expected to appear on the various
Melbourne courses. Meanwhile she made her debut
at the Miners’ Races, Ballarat, on November 28.
There she rode her pony Valaze in the Miners” Han-
dicap, and came in second last. Of course she was
loudly cheered. She wore a divided skirt, white
blouse, cream sash and a “boxer.” She tried again
in the Redan Handicap; hut was unplaced, partly
because she sot badly away. Some years ago Miss
Ronzio, of Melbourne, well known in the hunting-
field, applied for leave to ride in a Caulfield Steeple-
chase, but was refused. Since then women have per-
formed over big jumps at agricultural shows, and,
that being allowed, it’s hard to see where a line is
to be drawn.

February 1 is tentatively agreed upon bv
the principals as the date for the sculling match
between Ford and Felton. Two hundred pounds
constitute the stake, and the roof of the Parramatta
river provides the area of scuffle.
* * * *
The tussle for the eights’ chn'mpionship
of N S. Wales was won on the Parramatta on
Saturday by the holders—Enterprise. The other
starters were Leichhardt (who finished second) and
Ba main. Enterprise more or less, loafed home, for
although the boat passed the judge’s nose only about,
a length ahead of the pursuing barge, the oarsmen
were never extended on the voyage. Balmain was
signalled later in the evening.
The McCoy-de Ponthieu match at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night was an absurdity. De
Ponthieu took a brief but indisputable hiding, and
then signalled to his seconds to cast his dish-cloth in.
Nelson-like, they turned a blind eye upon him. His
gestures grew frantic. Anxious though the gallant
little band in his corner were to dispute the affair
to the last ditch, they could not choose but see.
The towel came in .to the accompaniment of a
blizzard of hoots from the experts in the back seats.
De Ponthieu explained afterwards that he had a sore
throat. It is interesting, medically, to . note that
swollen tonsils and cold feet produce the same effect
on occasion.
Astonishment fit the completeness of Jeff
Smith’s failure against Mick King was the dominant
note in N.S.W. boxing circles last week. The popu-
lar view appears to be that if Smith was as well as
he looked, and if his hands were as sound as he said
they were, over-weening self-confidence was to blame
for the tragedy. Smith certainly fought like one
who had only to step in, swing a sledge-hammer blow
or two, and achieve a massacre. He regarded King
as a fellow War Lord did Belgium. People who do
this sort of thing mostly fall in. The best answer
to those who claim that Smith hit King frequently
is the fact that King is not dead. Had one or two
of Jeff’s terrific haymakers landed. King, however
armor-plated, would have had a hole driven through
him. As things were, King emerged without an
abrasion, and he was fresh enough to fight the 20tli
round with a full pressure of steam up. lie may not
repeat the performance it Smith elects next time to
box more and scrap less, but the odds should never
again be four to one against him this side of middle-
age.

The Mehegan-Volaire dispute at the new
Brisbane Stadium ended in gloom. The controversy
had been raging about one minute —in the course of
which the Caul had hooked the Melbournite on the
chin, belabored him about the body, and smitten him
on the right ear—when the trouble happened.
Mehegan fell or was knocked down. Volaire sprain*
at lnm and hit him on the back of the iiead. The
referee gave the fight to Mehegan. Volaire burst
into tears. His manager, Mr. Aueinelli, smacked his
face. Tlie distracted pugilist's sobs increased in
volume. He was led wailing from the ringside.
1 lie crowd swore. The only satisfied party was
Hiighie Mehegan, and ho would have preferred a
different ending. The audience was provided, as a
salve, with a contest between two local warriors.
PETER KEMP reminisces about old
time sculling.
Freddie Welsh, lightweight champion
of the world, was well beaten last week by Joe
SliugTue, unless the U.S. cablemaii lies. As the
bout was only -a 10-round hue it does not count in
the records. In* fact, about the only outcome will be
to ruin Shugrue’s chances of getting good odds
when he persuades Welsh to meet him for the cham-
pionship title. Shugrue is the best lightweight
Australia has seen for many a year. Like so many
coming pugs, he is a Yid—-an R.C. Yid. He makes
the sign of the cross before commencing each fight.
Johnny Summers did the same, but he overstressed
the practice. Johnny not only crossed himself at the
beginning and end ; of every round, but at each
knock-down which he scored. On ;Sueh occasions he
apparently prayed that the enemy would not be
suffered to get up. The Australian crowd regarded
it as an attempt to load the dice or something and
got rather sick of Johnny, but the unobtrusive
religionism of Shugrue left him popular to the end.

A joker collected his reward in the Blue
Swan the other night. Raising his glass he ex-

Ma’s representative Eleven for the South
includes five colts, which is cheering. At time of
writing \ ictoria had not selected its champions, but
in the bunch from which the team will be collected
there are also a number of new stock. The two
XT’s will meet on December 26. Vic. follows the
match with one against S.A. on January 1.

“Stumps”: The selection of the N.S.W.
cricket team to play against Victoria and South
Aus. seems to show that the game in Australia is in
the doldi urns. The vacancies made by Trumper,
Carter, Hordern, Cotter, Barbour and others are not
adequately filled, the selectors, having to dig up A. J.
Hopkins to make a decent bowling side. But while
several good names are missing Ma’s team looks, on
paper, more than equal to the southern crowd, ’vic-
toria has lost Armstrong and Ransford; S.A. Clem
Hill and Crawford; and neither side has adequate
colts coming on.
Fred. Midlane, one of Maoriland’s best
batsmen, announces his intention to throw his pads
off for good. He started in 1897, at Wellington
(M.L.), and promised so well that, when he settled
in Sydney, in 1902, Maoriland was open to a mild
bet that it would, within a reasonable time, have a
representative in the Australian XI, Up till 1908,
when he left the Commonwealth, the hope had not
nearly matured. This season (to time of writing 1 )
Midlane has scored 260 runs for once out.
The recent match between Canterbury
(M.L.) first 11 and the Colts provided a surprise for
the big guns. Having first wallop the inexperi-
enced people smacked un 220. Then they fell upon
the reps, and outed them for a paltry 103. Encour-
aged by this the youthful team returned to the
sticks and smote the Reps.’ bowling to the several
winds of Heaven. One boy, named Butler, accumu-
lated 107 and then gracefully retired. When time
ran out the juniors were tearing along at the rate of
355 for six wickets. They won on the first innings
by 57 runs. It was their busy day.
Sydney’s champion school cricketer, T. M.
Taylor, was in smashing humor last week. Playing
for Newington College r. St. Ignatius’ he scored 125
out of 313, and followed this-up with 227 out of 325
against Scots’ College. As a result of Taylor’s on-
slaughts Newington College is having the time of its
life in the (treat Public Schools battle for the pre-
miership.
The inter-State junior cricket blow-out
at Sydney at the year-end will bring 1 to the pitch
teams from Victoria, South Aus., Queensland (for
the first time), and N.S.W. A novelty is that
players must be under 25.
Playing for North Sydney against Gordon
on Saturday Hopkins came to light again with five
wickets for 30—three bowled. Randell, who has
been showing form for Middle Harbor, bagged seven
for 59—four bowled. Also, he caught a man out,
so Sydney's team was his meat, in a manner of
speaking.
The top scorer in First-Grade Cricket at
Sydney on Saturday was Trenerry, of Paddington,
who is one of the colts selected by the N.S.W. Asso-
ciation to practise for representative games, lie
accumulated 83.
“Aristide”: “The dry fly,” to which the
swift, clear streams of the Monaro (N.S.W.) are
uniquely adapted, is held, hv those who know, to
easily outclass driven grouse or partridges, rocketting
pheasants, tandem-driving, the flushing of snipe and
woodcock, or any of those sports which essentially
demand intense dexterity. Henri Petit, whose book,
“La Truite de Riviere,” may one day rank with
Issaak Walton’s, observes that the trout “is like a
dainty princess,” to which may be added that the
taking of such a fish other than by the “dry fly” is
1o brand oneself in culture and refinement for some-
thing in the nature of a German. The “dry fly” theory
is based upon the fact that at the beginning of the
season the trout takes up a position in the river
which it never varies by even (lie fraction of an inch
until the season’s close. It is a curious illustration
of Darwin’s discovery of the struggle for survival
that if tin's trout is taken another of exactly similar
weight will seize the vacant place, hi a “dry fly
stream” great hatches occur of the ephemerae which
one sees flying, dancing and floating upon the water.
The successful fish, that has battled tor and won a
good place, is in a spot where nourishing quantities
of these tiny flies pass over his head, lie lies at the
surface of the water, and as those he lilacs pass by
lie raises his head slowly and sucks them in. The
problem for the dry-fly expert is to imitate these
microscopic realities by the artificial, and to do so
not. in the matter of form and color alone but in
their movements as they alight, repose upon and leave
the surface of the water. Perfection in easting is the
merest of sine qua nous. ft is probably as difficult
to take the fly off the water without disturbance and
in a perfectly natural manner as it is to put it on.
The greatest of ail difficulties is to control and avoid
“the drag.” In the case of the tinv artificial article
there are some 60 feet of line trailing away, and this
lies across every kind of intervening current, swirl
and cross current. If the linfi is caught in any one
of these currents it will, failing the most subtle and
delicate handling, cause the fly to “drag,” and then
the trout “goes down,” and sport with that fish is
over.
* * * *
The opening of the tunn.v-fishing season
is imminent in N. S. Wales —if there can be said to
be any particular season for this sport. The favorite
place is Port Stephens, the magnificent natural har-
bor which successive Governments have neglected in
the interests of Newcastle and Sydney. The tunnv
fisherman is of a different type from the rock-hopper.
His outfit costs him about LI 00. Launch hire runs
to a fiver a day or more. On the other hand, lie
gets the goods. Within a few minutes of reaching
the Heads and starting to troll he will he into a
big fish—a tunny, Spanish mackerel or kingfish
from 15 up to 30, or perhaps 40, pounds—and for the
rest of the day it is one long fight with these mon-
sters. The strength of the lines and easts, and the
number of hooks used are limited by the Catalina
(U.S.) Club, with which the local Fly-Casting Club
is affiliated. This gives the fish a chance. In fact,
they get more than a chance. Two out of three
break loose before they come to the gaff even when
handled by such experienced anglers ‘ as Gorrick or
Maitland. The bait is a garfish tied with thin wire
to a single hook and spun behind a slowly-moving
launch, .at a distance of a hundred feet or more.
When the fish strikes the launch is stooped or backed
as required. The fisherman has no need to use his
eyes for information as to what sort of prev lie has
touched. The manoeuvres of the different‘fish are
absolutely distinctive. Thus the funny fights in
short, sharp jerks like a particularly distracted
sehnapper ; the Spanish mackerel goes off in one long
unstoppable rush, for three or four hundred feet,
and then sounds, and so on. The latter is a fine
eating fish. Cut in steaks and fried it is as good
as anything we have in the sea.

Champion swimmer “Billy” Bongworth
showed a return to form at Sydney on Saturday
From scratch he cut out the third heat of the 100yds’
in 59 3-5 .seconds, and won the final in 58 3-5 seconds’
Longworth looks like being the Ma State’s best water

The awakening of the amateur swimming
section in Sydney has caused (he League of Swim-
mers to shake up its energy department, in the hope
ot producing a professional swimming . carvival
Frank Beaurepaire (Vic.), Oscar Dickman and Alec
Wickham (N.S.W.), and other shining fish will be
invited to line up and compete for fame. Profit will
help to make fame palatable.
The Automobile Club of Australia, the
Sydney motor-men’s union, wound up its year on
November 30 with 499 members, which is 56 ahead
of the figures of 12 months ag'O. Members got into
their new club-house in Phi Hip-street late in the
year. These new quarters cost £15,000. The Club
had a few hundreds put by, and on these and its
generally respectable appearance it managed to effect
a deal. The old premises in Challis House would
have cost £5OO this current year, and the club gets
the much-better accommodation for another £lOO
or so in interest, etc.
The coming 48 hours’ League of Wheel-
men spin at Sydney at the end of the month will
have an inter-State flavor from Victoria, South Acs.
and Maoriland. Looking beyond its handle-bars the
League secs itself running a six days’ teams race
at Easter-time.' The prospects of a cycling revival
next year are favorable, but many a good prospect
lias been laid to rest before next year. Next year
is a wonderfully elusive beast.
There is another big motor-cycle speed
event in the air. The 1914 T.T. race, near (ioulburn,
was such a success that it has been decided to repeat
the experiment early next year in Victoria. The
distance is still undecided. This year’s course was
100 miles, hut the England Tourist Trophy, whose
name Australia borrowed, is well over 200 miles, so
some riders are sticking out for something more
strenuous than a 100-mile course. The only things
known for certain are that there’s going to be a
T.T. ; that if will be in Victoria ; that there will be
a “senior” for machines of over 600 c.c., or about
4-h.p.) and a “junior” ; and, finally, that it will he
on an “island’’ course, Vie. motorists having been
scared off out-and-home races by the disastrous smash
in their last big event.
According to latest trade figures, these are
the tallies of the different makes of ear (commercial
and pleasure) : Austria, 23 ; Belgium, 15 ; Denmark,
5 ; England, 67 : France, 94 : Germany, 9 ; Holland,
2 ; Italy, 22 : Russia, 1 ; Spain, 2 ; Switzerland, 9 ;
Sweden, 5; United States, 52S ; Australia, just one
less than Russia. The United States are responsible
for 63 makes of motor-evcles, England for 32 ;
France, 18; Austria, 16; Italy, 6; Switzerland, 5;
Belgium, 4 ; Denmark, 3 ; Australia, same as cars,
except that one or two firms have got as far as build-
ing a frame on to an imported engine. The three
best-sellers among cars are all American: and a
Yankee cycle also tops the list —with 60,000 for last
year.

The Oodnadatta statioiimaster flatly con-
tradicts Capt. White’s statement (B. ]9/11/’i4) that
pigeons sent to Oodnadatta for the race back to
Adelaide are usually left unfed on the wav up and
cn arrival, and that the S.P.C.A. should look into the
whole surroundings of the race. He claims that he
looks after the birds like a father, that they always
start on their 600-mile journey full of smiles and
hope and birdseed, and that if they mostly fail to
arrive anywhere—which is an admitted fact —it is
the Act of God, or the Kaiser, or hawks or some-
thing, and not his fault. Bird-expert White and the
railway man can now fight it out between them.
An extraordinary coincidence occurred in
the Flying Squadron's race on Port Jackson on
Saturday. The event was sailed in two heats, five
in each to start in the final. In the first heat, the
rounding buoy got adrift, and short cuts enabled
boats in the rear to get up to the leaders; some
even scrambled home among the place-getters. . The
five winners in this heat were then allowed to
compete against the five winners in the second heat
(which was properly sailed), and, curiously enough,
heat them and divided the prize money ( £2O).
Natural!v, there will be a protest. Whether it will
he heard above the howling protest against the rise
in the price of beer is another matter.
“Dally” Messenger, the one-time idol of
Sydney’s Rugby grounds, is qualifying' for a marine
reputation. On Saturday he appeared on Port
Jackson at the tiller of Kismet, and won the first
heat inutile Sydney Flying Squadron’s race.
Bag-hunters can take this as correct, and
then oil the guns for the Northern Territory. T. J.
Beckett, inspector of aborigines up there, is the
authority, lie says that on the lagoons round the
Big Banyan, on the Alligator-river, wild geese settle
in uncountable flocks. Recently he rode past
millions of them, and writes that the noise of their
Pinions as they rose, mingled with their loud, flute-
like honking, was as the sound of a great storm.
The natives say that all they have to do to get geese
is to climb up into the trees and knock the birds
down as they fly over, or follow along the tracks
of the flights and pick up the exhausted as they
fall. That portion of the Alligator-river is a perfect
paradise of a hunting ground.
Donald Currie, a veteran bowler, of
Carlton (Vic.), died recently at the age of 85. He
arrived in the southern State over 60 years ago, and
was one of the earliest members of the Victoria
Bowling Club. He “skipped” many a team for
('arlton.

Kaiser Willy lias caused trouble in
Bowlerdom. If he had been securely leg-roped and
gagged six months asm there would have been held in
Sydnev next Easter the biggest thing' on earth in the
shape of bowling tournaments. But with so many
players at the front or going there, and in conse-
ouenee of the g'eneral upset, the present feeling is
that it will be expedient to postpone this great
gathering.

The Davis Cup contests played in Eng-
land and the United States resulted in the Australian
and Maoriland Tennis Associations netting a profit of
£3500 between them. Tennis, therefore, is one of
the few Australian field sports in affluent circum-
stances these days. For all that, the future of- the
Davis Cup is wrapt in gloom. The British Empire
can’t go on with- it during the crisis, and the U.S.
may claim the utensil bv default. Brookes (for cer-
tain) and Wilding (probably) won’t be defending
again, and the chance of Australia helping to hold
the mug seems remote and visionary, like the road
from Berlin to Tipperary.
George Pearce has done excellent work as
Defence Minister. He was the first man
in that office to take off his coat and get
right inside the job. lie is always at work,
but his thoroughness is his snare. Few
men can stick as he does without paying for
it sooner or _ later _ with a breakdown. If
lie 'escapes, his savior will be his simplicity
of life., and the fact that his only vice lives
in a cigar box.

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper over each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age. whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grev or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easv to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, of younger years.
Dr. B. ALLEN’S <u.s.ao
Mexican WALNUT STAIN
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,
mercury, eilver, sulphur, etc., and is equallv suitable
for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or Moustache.

Butcher: (1) Up to four or six months
a lamb ; then a weaner up to 12 months ; a hogget
up to two years ; after that a sheep. (2) After 12
months a calf becomes a steer or heifer ; a steer is
entitled to call itself a bullock when' it is" two years
old, and a heifer becomes a cow after its first calf,
usually at two years old. But if you’re a butcher in
practice, anything up to a 20-year-old is lamb....
H.R.: They’re hopeless. .. .Angus McA.: Wilhelm
respectfully rejected after earnest consideration....
Townie: As you say, there is nothing much wrong
with the N.S.W. State wheat-farm idea except the
methods proposed. You could say the same for re-
lieving the distress among rabbiters by putting them
to make boots, or for using up the unmarketable wool
by turning unemployed wharf-laborers on to blanket-
making. ... Londo: It is an old theme, and you treat
it in the conventional way. .. .M.E.W.: No market
here. It belongs to an Aunt Martha Column. .. .
J.L. (Melb.) : Take your spurious Village Black-
smith and dive into the scrub with our spears
whistling round y0u.... Elsa M. G.: You almost
make a low-comedy goddess of her when you bewail
the fact that you hadn’t seen her teeth. .. .Lola G.:
Yes, war is “savage, sinister, bleeding, red.” AVould
you expect it to be mild and pleasant like the parish
priest when he attends the euchre party and dance?
.. . .Curious (M.L.) : Written in all sincerity by a
real man and printed because it entertains a lot of
readers, including practically all the regular versi-
fiers. lie probably has as big an audience as any
man writing. .. .Sydney Heymanson (V.) : Good shot,
Sydney! You’re a promising 11-year-01d.... Edith
W. It.: Address the Kaiser direct. .. .L.A.D.: It’s very
bad, and we haven’t the remotest idea what it's all
about. .. .Periscope: Dive !. .. .Paddy-m.: Senile decay,
... .Carissima: Tom Moore all over again. There is no
market for gentle dicky-bird verses nowadays. .. .
Violet M.t No Eagle or Lion to-day, thank y0u....
F.C.F.: All well below standard. .. .G.C.A.: All fail
in a genteel manner. .. .It.M.V.: Cast 0ut.... Gladys
M. P.: No, Gladys. .. .Bellerive: They're not Allies,
so here goes, and curse the Censor: —
Hard times prevaileth through the drought and the
War
Among the poor and unfortunate the wolf howls at
the door ;
Europeans may starve, but ’tis a glorious place
To the monopolizing bands of the mongolian race,
In the victoria market you can plainly scan
A doz Chinese stall holders to every whiteman ;
Despite the hard times ’tis a glorious place
To the monopolising bands of the Mongolian race.
....Coot: If she was 95 years old when she died
how did she manage to be born in “the year Queen
Victoria ascended the throne” ?.... Sydniensis: Too
indefinite. ...Bodysnatcher: Thanks... .H.AV.11.: No
reason why you shouldn’t try; not enough interest
in first par. ... Hilaris Kaneiry: You're talking
through your hat. . . .C.W.W.: Henry Lawson’s lines
were written for The Bulletin towards the end of
the Russo-Jap. war. A slice of them:—
Though Russian hope seems shattered, and though
Russia’s star seems set,
It may mean the dawn of Russia, and my hope’s in
Ivan yet.
Hold them, Ivan! Staggering bravely underneath
your gloomy sky!
Hold them, Ivan! We shall want you pretty badly
by-and-bye. . . .
Never Briton watched for Blucher as he’ll watch for
Ivan yet!
. ...Esseff: Three hundred words on a triviality like
that! How much of the language would you leave
over if you saw something really interesting?....
Martha: Hardly enough general interest. .. .Ander-
son: It’s an old music-hall song. The chorus opened,
“Australia, that’s the little son—John Bull, junior,”
and closed, “The world could hardly do without
young John Bull.” A.L.8.: Don’t know that
roosters swim creeks; it depends upon what is on
the other side A.C.P. : Don’t think you need
worry Zwanzeur: “The Snake” didn’t suggest
that the Belgian was a drunkard. His idea was that
the Belgian drinking his beer in good digestible quan-
tities was a well-nurtured individual. Don’t you
think so?

“drawings.”) Harry H.: Scratch, scratch,

Too trifling.
It seems to liave been tlie dread of what
his own people and press would say if he
backed out spurs-first that finally drove the
actor-manager of Europe to stage “Arma-
geddon, or Little Willy’s Good-Night.” J.
Ellis Barker, in the Nineteenth Century,
recalls that —
when one diplomatic failure followed the other in
quick succession, when at last it became generally
recognised that he habitually threatened but did not
act, Germany’s leading men sarcastically referred to
him as the Friedenkaiser, and began openly to call
him a coward. After his second failure to overawe
France by raising the Morocco Question. the ultra-
patriotic Post of Berlin referred to him as a poltron
miserable in leaded print. His friends and his own
family, especially the Crown Prince, openly showed
their disgust that the Emperor’s bold words were
never followed by suitable action. Many leading
Germans began to despair of the Emperor and of the
future of their country.
So the great drama was staged in the hour
of desperation by a henpecked warlord who
didn’t want to go down to history as William
the False Alarm, and his juvenile lead, the
Crown Prince, proved to be an heroic messer
in his part of general. If *he Berlin Post
isn’t gagged and bound it should be gibbering
impressively by now.
Ex-Judge Chomley, who was 57 years in
the Vic. public service, and died last week,
had the remarkable record of never having
lost a day’s work through illness. Possibly
his even temper had something to do with
his good health. Nobody ever saw him so
much as ruffled in court.

A HAPPY BALD-HEADED
MAN.
Well-known Politician Nearly Bald Now
Has New Growth of Hair.
Tells How He Did It.
A certain politician, well known on account
of his baldness and ready wit, surprised Ms
friends by appearing with a new growth of
hair. Many of his old friends did not know
him and others thought he had a wig. On
being asked how he did it, he made the fol-
lowing statement: “I attribute the remark-
able growth of my hair to the use of the
following simple recipe, which any lady or
gentleman can mix at home: To a half-pint
of water add loz. of bay rum, a small box

Apply to the scalp two or three times a
week with the finger tips. It not only pro-
motes the growth of the hair but removes
dandruff, scalp humors, and prevents the hair
from falling out. It darkens streaked, faded

glossy. These ingredients can be purchased

SCOTT'S
I* MELBOURNE •
For the Christmas
Holiday Season
there is no place where you can have the advantage of a
modernly-conducted hotel, combined with the sumptuousness and
convenience of your own home, as .you can at “Scott’s.” It is
but four months ago that the entire rebuilding and reconstruction
of Scott’s Hotel was completed, and now it is recognised by the
most superior people as the finest hotel in Australia —for comfort,
convenience and service.
Perfectly ventilated, with exceptional natural light by day, and
the latest of convenient electric lighting for night use, each
room has its own private-attendance ’phone, and hot and cold
water service is installed in bedrooms.
There are also delightful sitting, lounge and writing rooms and
“ARCADE” and “ROOF” SMOKING LOUNGE, which, like all
other rooms, are sumptuously and most comfortably furnished.
The cuisine is par excellence, and music is rendered by the
Hotel Orchestra.
“Scott’s” is most conveniently situated to Railway Stations,
Passenger Steamship Wharves, and Buildings and other Places
of Public Interest.
Suites may be arranged for, including private sitting-room,
bedrooms, bathroom, etc.

As was anticipated, the mean A ictorian
landowner has grabbed the latest chance ot
passing on to the general body ot taxpayers
the burdens he ought to carry. hnnselt. llie
other day Portland shire decided to reduce
its rate from a paltry Is. 3d. in the £1 to a
shameless Is. in the £l, on the ground that
the Hoads Board “had taken over the main
roads”! If ever a State Premier needed a
reason for abolishing the corruptive muni-
cipal subsidy, there is one for I eacock here.
Again the United States person rushes to
the assistance of England. An old-estab-
lished leather firm of Leeds (England) re-
cently received a letter to this effect, from
“11. AY. Forbush, 533-541 Canal-street, New
York: —
Gentlemen,—Present reports indicate that the Ger-
man army is altogether too successful, and is gradu-
ally getting nearer England. . ... ,
If their success continues, invasion ot the Brititm
Isles will follow. Leather stocks will then be confis-
cated. Would it not be better to ship it to me, and
get something for it ? . • ,
I sincerely hope that nothing like this will happen,
but, if it does, I will say that 1 will buy anything
in leather, sole, harness, upper, dressed or undressed,
and rough leather, you many choose to ship me, pay-
ing cash for same, at one-half of to-day s market
price.
Same could be shipped by any boat to me at Boston,
New York City preferred, or Philadelphia, insurance
to be paid by you.
I have arranged for cash to handle large quan-
tities, but this cash is available only if we van buy
cheap enough. . ,
Of course, you, know our sympathies are all with
England, but the reports here are that Germany is
cleaning up everything, and we sincerely hope that
no such contingency may arise, but I thought I would
write this to you' that you may depend on me in
case of urgent need.
And this half-price leather person’s sympa-
thies “are all with England” !
Germany had a world-wide scheme for
boosting trade and culture when the Kaiser
seized sword and firestick. It took the
form of a syndicate for the supply of news
abroad, and was the subject of a warning
from British Ambassador Goschen to his
Government. To private subscriptions of
£25,000 per annum the Foreign Office added
£12,500, and the 'whole lot was put at the
disposal of the Secret Service for the pay-
ment of subsidies to foreign newspapers. It
was originally intended to scatter German
journalists broadcast, Avith instructions to
get busy; but, ultimately, it was decided that
it would be better to fall back upon gentle-
men Avho are already in touch with the
respective editorial offices, and who could
seiwe German interests without attracting so
much attention. It looks as though some of
those gentlemen were discovered on the press
of dollar-mongering Uncle Sam.
“A.H.A.” : Happening to possess a handy
Commonwealth ten-pound note —such a thing
occasionally happens even in war-time —and
requiring change, I asked at my bank for 10
one-pound notes. Instead of receiving
the neat-sized Commonwealth publica-
tions I was presented with 10 notes printed
by the English, Scottish and Australian
Bank for issue in South Australia, but taken
over by the Commonwealth and botched up
to serve for national use. Apparently new,
too, since the teller took my lot from a bundle
he had just received. AA T hat’s happened to the
CoramoWealth note? Now is the time for
the GoA r ernment to popularise its neat little
scrap of paper. It can’t do (his while all
sorts of notes are being issued, even though
the S.A. note has got a beehive and a lot of
bees on it. It’s unfair to the tellers, too.
With notes of a dozen different sizes in use
the tellers are bound to miscount, and in
nearly every case the miscount will be
against themselves. AYhich naturally pre-
judices them ; and in their turn they prejudice
the public.
“Kodak” supplies an ocean beach film :
The man, who wasn’t quite shapeless, hut would
be presently, stood on the beach and waved his hand
in kingly fashion at the sea. The hand, which was
freckled, was at the far end of a mottled bare arm,
for the man was loosely contained in a thin blue
bathing-suit. A clinging Canadian would have held
him together better; but he chose, in the perverse
way fat men have, to wear a thing that allowed him
to sag in every direction. He was probably a
merchant-duke in his clothes; in the bathing-suit he
was merely a comic robber-baron out of a panto-
mime. Needless to say, he was bald in a pinkly
defiant way that suggested suicide by sunstroke;
and the sun was doing its best to oblige him by
pouring down its rays on the pink dot that was his
head.
Far out to sea a smoking tug soared and sank
gracefully in the vicinity of two long, low smudges
that seemed to be waiting an opportunity to do
something horrible. The fat man Avaved his hand
in their direction, and the ocean roared like a lion,
and fell down in a tumbled heap like a ghost, and
crawled hissing like a snake to his feet, which it
kissed reverently ere retiring swiftly backwards like
a practised Gold-Stick-in-Waiting.
“Rubbish punts!” snarled the fat surfer, and
shook his fist at the smudges wallowing blackly in
the. sun-glare far out from the sloping, golden sands
they intended to profane once more. “Filthy
rubbish punts filling up the sea with all the d —d
rubbish in Sydney! Savages I call ’em! D’ye
think I’m going into the surf if they fill it up with
dead cats? Why, 1 came in on a breaker this morn-
ing with two dead cats! AYhen the tide turns the
d—d things will come back riper than ever with
whatever those brutes are dropping in now! I tell
you I’ll give the whole game best if they’re going
to keep on ruining the beaches this way instead of
burning the stuff and turning it into light and
power!”
And the humble, roaring ocean that was being
forcibly fed with garbage fell down with a deafening
roar for (lie millionth time since sunrise, and rushed
impetuously to his shapeless feet, which it kissed
passionately with white lips. I could almost hear
it whispering: “Darling! don't leave me! It isn't
my dead that I am giving up—it is the Sydney
City Council’s!”
Dixon, the Australian maker of many
cordials, tells a story of his last visit to
Germany, three years ago. lie Avas in
Europe that time to introduce one of his
largely-advertised lines. “My first visit to
the Customs.” he says, “avus to get the
duty fixed. I Avaited three days, and they
told me 13s. a dozen —about Avlmt aa'c sell
it for in Australia. I said I couldn’t bring
it in at the price—the rate was prohibitive.
The officers smiled. AYell. surely you
understand that that’s Avhat it’s intended
to be.’ Then they whispered in my ear
that the raw material would be admitted
free if I liked to build a factory in the
country. The Avhole secret of Germany’s
Avhizzing industrial progress was explained
in about three sentences.”

Here, Madam, is the Gift for a
man —a Gillette Safety Razor
You can hunt a long time without finding anything that he
will thank you for so sincerely. You may be sure that he
will use it, to make his shaving simple and easy, to
economize his time and save his money.
Using a Gillette, he will have a velvet-smooth shave in three
minutes every morning and a grateful regard for your
thoughtfulness in giving him so practical a gift.
With a Gillette, a man can shave quickly—without any fuss
or bother—without having to strop his blade. He gets a
comfortable shave without cuts or irritation-it is perfectly
safe.
He gets a really clean shave—the blade can be adjusted to
suit the stiffness of his beard and the tenderness of his skin.
A Gillette Razor makes an Ideal Christmas Gift for any
man-Father, Brother, Uncle, Cousin or a near friend.
Do your shopping early—buy him a Gillette to-day .
There are many styles to choose from, in handsome leather, silver and
gold-plated cases from One Guinea to ten. British Made. Sold every-
where. Write for illustrated and descriptive Booklet.

The Spirit of the Child
The Spirit of the Child
By T. C. WOLLASTON.
PRICE FIVE SHILLINGS.
Ist Edition, JUNE,. ’l4.
2nd Impression, SEPTEMBER, ’l4
This artistic book of 228 pages
measures Si x6J inches. It contains
five full-page illustrations in color, and
six in black and white. Handsomely
blocked in gold and attractively boxed.
Price 5/-, or 5/4 post free.
This is a book such as is rarely met
with and one which is rapidly making
new friends. Australian children will
welcome “The Spirit of the Child,
because it will amuse and interest them.
It was written for them by an Austra-
lian father, and is sure to please. Read
this Review, and judge for yourself:
This is a beautiful book. Not merely in print-
ing and binding and general effect. The thought
is beautiful, and the expression of the thought
moves with beautiful grace. Here is nothing
patronising or adroitly shallow; not the easy
confidence of the expert, but the serene, deep con-
fidence of ripe comprehension that has realised
itself untarnished. The book purports to be a
collection of letters written to his children by a
father on his travels. He writes naturally, with
an unfailing, tender reverence. His love of nature
is a real thing that glows on every page. There
is nothing namby-pamby about the letters. They
are written to intelligent children who can think
in good English. The genuinely bewitching illus-
trations help the story. The good effect of the
opening pages is dplicately sustained throughout.
There is nothing that jars in the book. An
amazing thing. , , . ,
The book is delightfully fresh and singular and
sweet, and lam enthusiastic about it. Get it for
vour children if you do not want it for yourself.

overcomes Brisbane’s greatest menace.
Proprietor,
T. M. AHERN.
IN BANANA LAND
On a proposal to enable members of the
Expeditionary Force to exercise the franchise
by proxy, Philp proposed to give them two
votes apiece. The old plural-vote supersti-
tion dies hard.
“Ess” on an old scrap of history:—
I was interested in the history of Hornet Bank and
its massacre, and when passing through in 1895 I
inspected the premises and made inquiries. The story
T pieced together was this. The blacks broke into
the house at daylight. Whilst they were at their
awful work one of the girls escaped and ran to the
woolshed. The blacks followed and dragged her out
by the hair and killed her. (The old house was
pulled down about the beginning of ’95, but the
woolshed was still standing, though sheep had long
given place to cattle on the run.) Jimmy Frazer,
then about 14, and a brother were sleeping in the
one bed. The brother was killed with a nulla, and
Jimmy was stunned. He rolled out and under the
bed, where he lay till the blacks had left the
house. Then, snatching up a bridle, he ran down to
a horse which was grazing in a paddock at the foot
of the hill. The blacks, who had been waiting
about, went in pursuit. No one had ever succeeded
in catching this horse outside of a yard, so Jim’s
chances looked too slight to be worth anything.
On the bridling of the doubtful beast without the
loss of a moment the fugitive’s life depended. The
horse stood as quiet as a lamb. Frazer sprang on
to his back and galloped him at a three-railed
fence. The horse smashed through the top rail and
landed on its nose. Though bare-backed the young-
ster stuck to his seat, and, quickly pulling his mount
together, galloped away and escaped. He was the
only survivor, the recently-deceased Billy being at
Ipswich at the time with a team. The victims were
the mother, four daughters, three sons, the tutor and
two male employees. The survivor, hatless and boot-
less, first rode to Eurombah, a squattage 12 miles
away ; afterwards he went on to Ipswich, 320 miles,
covering the distance, with only two changes of
horses, in three days. With his brother Billy, who
was loading his team at George Wilson’s store, he
started back almost immediately, the return journey
being completed in the same time with three
change of horses. Standing at the graveside of his
mother and sisters, with an uplifted tomahawk in his
hand, Billy swore that he would never rest until
he had sunk it in the head of the blaekfellow who
was the cause of the murder. And he did it. He
lived to be nearly 83, but he had many narrow
escapes. Once, whilst riding through the bush, a
spear, hurled down from the branches of a tree,
plunked through the rim of ' his cabbage-tree hat,
grazed his shoulder-blades and stuck.into his saddle.
There’is much of interest in the history of the Frazer
brothers that has never been published. Billy Frazer
gave the story of his life to Ashton Murphy, of
Mitchell, with instructions not to publish till after
his death.
President of the Senate Givens has seen a
lot of Australia since he struck it as a 17-
year-old boy from Tipperary 34 years ago.
He was a tin packer in Ilerberton’s early
days ; a tinstreamer at the Tate ; an under-
ground man at Gympie and the Towers. He
overlanded from Hughenden (Q.) to Kim-
berley (W.A.j in 1885 as a big lump of a
boy of 22, and got to Hall’s Creek to find
that the rush had been and passed over.
Sadly lie and his mates turned back to
Hughenden and were five months on the
track. Givens, like Speaker McDonald, will
have none of the wig and gown of the Presi-
dency, and runs the Senate in ordinary
clothes just like a white man. He has suc-
ceeded through quickness, persistence and a
general likeableness, and he doesn’t care
how far it is to Tipperary, Australia having
been too kind to him to permit him to be
homesick.
Administrator Gilruth, of the Northern
Territory, in his latest report says he is
not surprised that land settlement is not
progressing in the North while the southern
States still have plenty of country to offer
and make liberal grants of cash to advertise
inducements. But he gets several yards
outside his job when he expresses the opinion
that it “is not altogether to be regretted”
that the farmer with capital does not go
North while there is still land to be secured
in the South. The eminent horseleech there-
upon enumerates some of the alleged dis-
advantages of the settlers’ life in the
Territory. He says Darwin is 12 days’
journey from Sydney; that mails are
infrequent; that “the amenities of civilisa-
tion as known to most Australians are
absent” in Darwin, and “the South, with its
climate, friends and pleasures, keeps call-
ing.” Also, he states that if the Northern
European and the Anglo-Saxon were “in-
duced to come to the Territory by the most
liberal concession and labor treatment, the
likelihood is that as soon as many had saved
a fair amount of money they would remove
to the South.” Isn’t two thousand a year a
lot to pay a stinking-fish purveyor for the
Territory ?
OCULAR PROOF.
DENNIS: "Good mornin ', Mrs. Murphy, an' is Pat at home , sure?"
MRS. MURPHY: “Sure, where are your oyes, Dinnis Dinny? Isn’t that his shirt for-
nenst ye bangin' on the loine?"
The old, old story, as told once more in
the House of Reps.:—
Mr. Maloney asked if it was the intention to put
any more men to work on the Federal capital before
Christmas?
Mr. Archibald informed him that if room could
be found for any more he would be pleased to do so.
Mr. Page said that the Minister recently stated
his intention of putting more men on. As a conse-
quence there were many unemployed waiting for the
work.
Mr.. Bamford: “THOUSANDS.”
It is a familiar yarn. Thousands of men
waiting for a chance to build a dry and
hopeless metropolis out of loans, while the
miserable Low Tariff country borrows
£20,000,000 or £25,000,000 a year abroad
to pay for Yankee sharp-pointed boots and
German chemicals and sundries, in order that
its own artisans may be unemployed.
Denham is battling against a gang of
mutineers; Blair is sick; Welsby and
Macartney announce that they won’t stand
again ; the Licensed Victuallers have deserted
in a body. It certainly isn’t what you
could call a very cherful outlook for
Liberalism.
“P.F.”: Consider the “official” motors of
Queensland how they grow. Wullie Ividston
purchased the first. The Denham Govern-
ment followed suit and bought several. Then
the heads of Departments came along and
demonstrated that they couldn’t live without
rubber tyres. Next the Mayor of Brisbane
had to get one. Now the aldermen want
another. The only thing left is for the
wretched taxpayer to also demand a joy-ride.
Then our motto will be: “Socialism in our
time and motor-cars for everybody.”
The report of the Prickly Pear Commis-
sion, just tabled in the Bananaland
Assembly, is 140 pages strong. The
Commission visited India, S’Africa, the
Canary Islands, Sicily, Italy, Barbary,
Malta, Syria, Egypt, Germany, the United
States and Honolulu. Opunta Vulgaris did
no visiting; it simply stayed at home in
Bananaland, captured a few more ten
thousand acres, and covered it with bristling
spiked helmets.
Premier Denham announced a day or two
ago that, commercially, things in Queens-
land were back nearly to normal. The
butter business may be all right; but
Denham ought to ask the wool people how
they find things. Sales were fixed for last
week, and brokers in the South were called
off so that the Queenslanders might have
every possible chance; but, for all that,
competition fell down dead, and plenty of
lots couldn’t extract a bid. In other cases
only a poor sd. or Gd. was forthcoming. It
was thought that as the Japanese embargo
had been removed there might be a little
more briskness in the market; but
apparently it made no difference. In fact,
it is said now that the Japs, have been
buying in their small way all along in
anticipation of the action now taken. Things
may be a little improved by the lifting of
the embargo on merino exports to the United
States; but Uncle Sam’s arrival won’t
stiffen prices a great deal.
It was only in July that A. J. Stephenson,
of Ipswich’s old-established Times, was re-
warded for his paper’s long-standing blind-
ness to Liberal defects; and now he is dead.
Membership of the Council has been one of
Queensland’s most fatal diseases lately. Out-
side his devotion to Freemasonry, Stephen-
son was essentially a “local” man, and he
battled and bustled, with valuable results for
most things that the boss of A local paper is
reasonably expected to patronise. In Assem-
bly elections he had poor luck, and only
succeeded when the late Tom Cribb carried
him in on his broad shoulders.
In the Reps, last week Jokook was hand-
ing out some toffee to W. G. Higgs concern-
ing his (Higgs’s) abilities. Whereupon:—
Mr. Riley: The hon. member is only just begin-
ning to recognise his ability.
Mr. Cook: I have always recognised it a great
deal more than hon. members opposite have done.
Mr. Riley: I hope the hon. member will recognise
it when we come to send him to London.
Mr. Fisher: Hear, hear.
A tip, or a quip?
The Flute.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How kind it is of somebody in the office
across the way
To play a cool and trickling flute on such
a burning day !
It doesn’t matter about the tune, be it
martial music even,
Or a dreary dirge from a death bed’s verge
of the thorny way to Heaven,
Or a fairy jig, or a wedding march, or a
gloaming lullaby
As long as the flute, like a magic lute,
scrawls notes of the sea and sky!
It brings the crest of a high brown cliff,
with yellowy grasses waving,
And the languid lave of a golden wave the
base of the brown scarp caving,
It brings the sweep of a big clean sky a-swim
in a world of summer,
A seagull winging to ocean’s swinging, or a
pollen-buskined hummer,
Pink-tipped flowers in dusty grasses, petals
thirsty on dip and lea,
A scent of clover the landside over, and a
moist wind from the sea.
Now it sings like spume to a jutting rock,
and gurgles in unseen hollows,
Now it rustles leaves round a cottage eaves,
the home of the darting swallows,
Now it dies almost, as a breeze’s ghost in a
wood by the sun forgotten,
Now it sips in bliss, like a stolen kiss of a
clouded moon begotten,
Now it sinks to valleys, and cries its tale
of the sparkle of reach and breaker,
Where the noon is hot on the garden plot,
and fierce on the lucerne acre !
How kind it is of somebody in the office
across the way
To play a cool and trickling flute on a
burning, sultry day!
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, December 5, 1914.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
The one effervescent item in a week’s cup
of dullness was the Patriotic carnival for
which “Snowy” Baker was responsible. It
commenced in the early afternoon with a
procession, which was ornamented and made
beautiful by a generous helping of actors
and actorines, either members of companies
playing in Brisbane or temporarily engaged
in exhorting us to higher things. It seems
sacrilege to add that in the same procession
marched a body of black-trackers, headed by
an aboriginal “pug” (as he was described
to me) named Jeremiah Jerome. In addi-
tion, there were motor-cars decorated and
disguised as men-o’-war, aeroplanes, sub-
marine elephants and so on. Two of them
represented the Sydney and the Emden, and
fought upon the field in deadly humor.
The Stadium at night was crammed, so
much so that organiser Baker had portions
of the roof removed to reduce the pressure
of hot air. The entertainment consisted of
exhibitions of boxing, jiu-jitsu, hat-trimming
(one of the French boxers won this contest,
my dear, so you see they can be useful as
well as pugnacious), pie-eating (one boy ate
44 pies in as many minutes ; I was sorry
he could not swallow the remaining half of
the fifth pie ; it seems a pity to waste food
like that) and a corroboree of blacks. When
I tell you that the proceeds from the day’s
outing amounted to over £2200 you may
gather that it was a great time in the old
town.
The Governor-General and his lady and
T ady Doris Blackwood attended the show in
the afternoon and again in the evening.
Others who watched the proceedings were
Lieut.-Governor Arthur Morgan and daugh-
ter, Captain and Mrs. Clopet, Mrs. Page
Gray, and Mayor Jenkinson. The Lieut.-
Gov.’s lady was too unwell to attend, but
sent her entire sympathies.
Nudgee College building fund has still a
few odd chinks to be filled up, so another
f@te and sale of work happened on Thurs-
day. Lady Doris Blackwood removed the
lid of the affair with the encouragement and
assistance of Archbishop Duhig.
To-day (Saturday) another carnival (this
is nearly the last, my dear) in aid of the
Mater public hospital, the General hospital,
the South Brisbane Bed Cross, and the
Patriotic Fund rampaged at Mowbray Park.
Similar outbreaks on a smaller scale simul-
taneously burst forth at Mrs. Sparke’s home
at Ascot (this was for St. Augustine’s new
site fund), and at Mrs. Spencer Howie’s at
Clayfield (for the Belgian babies).
On Wednesday evening some of our lead-
ing artists gave a concert, the money from
which was to provide Christmas dinners for
the poor. As only about 50 citizens, includ-
ing the Mayor and Mayoress, attended, the
poor, presumably, will have to scratch for
their Christmas turkey and champagne. It
was a fine concert, but concerts are not edi-
ble. Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, Lena Hammond,
Gladys Frost and others performed; but
when the poor get the balance-sheet minus
even the gravy, the way they'll perform will
be a treat.
“Rosna’s” note from London:—
Dr. Eustace Black is the latest young Australian
medico to go to the Front with the British Army
Medical Corps. He’s a son of John Black, an Adel-
aide pressman, and has been collecting germs and
other experiences in London for a year or so after
practising for two years Outback in Queensland.
As doctors who go to the Front are to get a
free passage to any part of the world at the end of
the war, there’s an added inducement for our doctors
and doctoresses to take the trip to France.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Dock On, a well-known Cooktown Chow,
informs the local Independent that China
has 20 million men ready to sail to assist
the Allies. No wonder the Kaiser’s
moustache is getting a downward twirl!
“Norbell” : City dwellers don’t get half the
'joy out of the drama that playgoers do in
the woolly West. The Hyphen-Howler
Dramatic Co. was playing “Uncle Thomas’s
Cabin” at Barcaldine (Q.). Things dragged
on comfortably enough until the final act.
The ancient coon was slowly turning up his
toes to slow music, with all the accustomed
ceremony. Just here one of actorinas
let loose a word or two that caught Uncle
on the raw. The corpse was regalvanised
into life in a twinkling, and he tackled the
lady with murder in his eye. Then Simon
Degree resurrected and sent in a McCoy
corkscrew which landed on the point of
George Harris’s jaw, whilst Cassy and Eliza
settled a long-standing difference of opinion
in full view of the audience. Topsy laid
lawyer Marks out with the auctioneer’s ham-
mer, and in no time the full strength of the
company was at it in deadly earnest. Even
the saintly Little Eva hurried back from
Heaven to “word” the call-boy. I refuse
to repeat the word. Eventually a brutal
policeman was called in to ring down the
curtain. The audience wanted to howl him
off, declaring it was getting the best show
of its life.

The Return of

q Tulle is so soft, so delicate, so
dainty, so feminine in its loveliness —it imparts
sucii youthful appearance to the wearer —that
nothing could stem the tide of its return to

to ask for “Rainproof Tulle”—say “‘Dy-
namo’ Rainproof Tulle, please,” and look for
the name on the card on which the Tulle is wound.

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones —
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste thej'e would be no
further need of sermons, preach-
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth” is the dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all' tooth decay. Pebeco
Tooth Paste arrests this acidity of
the mouth —even destroys the
acid-producing bacteria them-
selves.
You have not settled the
problem of your teeth by merely
keeping them white, clean and
polished. Pebeco Tooth Paste
will SAVE them.

„ Soldiering having become fashionable, two
rival rifle clubs have started in Melbourne,
and Defence Minister Pearce is to be asked
for assistance with guns, etc. The Bulle-
tin doesn’t mind, so long as no hurt is done
to Australia’s compulsory system. For the
present the most necessary extension is in the
direction of more ships, and the money that
should go that way must not, above all
things, be used to buy limelight for mere
social climbers, who find the present army
regulations of Australia too democratic.
On a recent Sunday Sydney was pla-
carded with: “Terrible Disaster: 15.000
British drowned.” The source of the re-
markable story (German Official Wireless)
is the one and only joke Britain allows it-
self about the war. These messages are
caught .out of the air from Berlin by
Marconi House in the Strand, and are
printed by the dailies to cheer things up.
According to them Britain’s entire fleet has
been sunk 18 times, Australia is in a state
of civil war, and the aggregate of British
troops annihilated amounts at the present
moment to more than 25,000,000.
It seems that some British soldiers are
also servants yet. Rider Haggard’s nephew,
Lieutenant Mark Haggard, who died in
battle after doing excellent work, had bis
retainer in the best old manner. He
“charged the Germans at the head of his
company, lie and bis soldier servant out-
running the other men.. ..and after killing
three soldiersVhe fell mortally wounded and
was carried away by his servant.” It is
one of the practices that compulsory service
is going to make very difficult; and this is
part of the reason why compulsory service
is so,bitterly contested by “the best people”
in Britain—that is to say, the people who
don’t want to do without their soldier-
valets.
Concerning a French bull-ant:—
The cables say that Joseph Caillaux is on a mission
from France to South America to capture German
trade. Australians will mainly know him because
his- wife murdered Gaston Calmette, of the Figaro.
Inter alia, he is credited with being one of the few
humans whp understand international finance, and hence
his mission.* He is ever ready to fight anything, at
any weight, and once he starts it is “all in,” the
wells poisoned, and no prisoners taken. lie did what
the Kaiser’s armies failed to do, for in defending his
wife he took on tffe entire French nation and laid it
' l° w - He is ugly, but women like him, and he
reciprocates heartily. Hence the bulk of his troubles.
But it probably matters little to him, as the only
things he cares about are women and fighting. His
type is hopelessly antipathetic to the French and
theirs to him ; but despite a mutual loathing they
have got to have him, as he can’t speak any other
language. His present mission, by the way, may
ultimately lead him to Australia.
Archdeacon Boyce, of Sydney, escaped
from Germany and celebrated his arrival in
London by publishing a pamphlet on “An
Early Australian Worthy, Thomas Moore,”
who gave his name to Moore College and
Moorebank (Liverpool). Born over 150
years ago, he arrived in Sydney as carpenter
of the Britannia, a vessel of 276 tons, in
1701. . Later on-—in 1796 —he decided to
settle in Australia. Governor Hunter ap-
pointed him master boat-builder, and gave
him a house, which stood opposite the pre-
sent fire station in George-street North.
Two years later he was made a member of
the Vice-Admiralty Court, and about the
same time Governor Hunter gave him a
grant of 470 acres lying between Petersham
and Cook’s .River. After that he was heard
of as a shipowner and the holder of a large
grant of land at Liverpool, where he resided
and became Chief Magistrate. Dying in
1840 he left all his property to the Anglican
Church, a part to provide a Theological Col-
lege. and a part—his North George-street
houses—as an endowment for St. Andrew’s
1 Cathedral.
Of one of England’s great men :
Britain is rich at the moment in remarkable men,
and John Simon, its Attorney-General, is amongst the
first three or four of them. He has only just turned
40, yet His lightning rush to fame has been a theme
of the Bar for years. To make his career the more
remarkable, his only asset is his astonishing mind.
The words have been over-used which might otherwise
have described the clearness of it. All his jury ver-
dicts were won simply because the 12 men never saw
anjdhing so clearly as the case Simon presented to
them. He has broken many, possibly all, records at
the Bar. Thus his silk gown arrived at the age of
35, and he had never appeared in a criminal case
till after he became Attorney. All other young advo-
cates have “tried it on the dog” in the form of
defending and prosecuting criminals. Simon has
never defended anybody. Had he wished he could
have been Lord Chancellor at 39, when Loreburn
retired. Nowadays many good judges think that he
will one day get the world’s greatest prize and become
Prime Minister, but his lack of personal magnetism
will probably hamper him. Outside work his main
intercsts-in-life are his children, with whom he.spends
all spare moments at Banbury, near Oxford. He also
takes the barrister’s usual tentative interest in pic-
tures, and is well informed on these matters.
“Coot”: To those who think that the
present war is singular in atrocity, I com-
mend Tolstoy’sj “War and Peace ” A few
sentences:—
On the l2th June, 1812, the armies of Western
Europe crossed the frontier, and, the war began.
That is, an event took place contrary to
all human reason and all human nature.
Millions of men committed against one another
so great a mass of crime—fraud, cheating, rob-
bing, forging, the issue of false money, plunder,
arson and murder —that the annals of all the criminal
courts of the world do not muster such a sum of
wickedness in whole centuries, though those who
committed these deeds did not at the time regard
them as crimes.
How well the following fits in with the
astonishing effort of the Belgians—who, it
must be remembered, were not soldiers in
the European sense of the word —when the
war began :
The decisive element in the success or failure of
an army, and particularly in the case of a national
uprising against an invader, is to be found, not in
the strategy or tactics of the commanders, but in
the spirit that animates the army or the people. To
find the value of a fighting force you must multiply
the number engaged by the spirit that moves them.
Tolstoy, by the way, spoke as an expert.
He was an artillery officer at the siege of
Silistria, and put in 12 blood-stained and
insanitary months at Sebastopol.

This is “Wincarnis” —the
wine that gives New life to
o
the Invalid —New strength
to the Weak —New blood
to the Anaemic —New vigor
to the “Rundown” —and
New health to everyone.

Here are a few reasons why YOU should take “Wincarnis”
If you suffer from Anaemia, Weakness, Sleeplessness, Nerve
Troubles, Brain-fag, Exhaustion, or if you are “Run-down” —
“Wincarnis” will give you new health, new strength, new vigor, new
vitality and new life. Just as water revives a drooping flower —so
“Wincarnis” gives new life to the weakened body. Because “Win-
carnis” is a Tonic, a Restorative, a Blood-maker and.a Nerve-food —
all combined in one clear, delicious beverage. It strengthens the
weak —revives the exhausted —cheers the Depressed—gives new
blood to the Anaemic—-vigor to the Fatigued—new vitality to the
“Run-down” —s lee p to
the Sleepless —and new
life to all whose health
is not as it should
he. The effects of “Win-
carnis” are immediate.
You can actually feel it
doing you good. You
can feel it flooding your
system with new health, new strength, new vigor, new vitality and
neiv life. “Wincarnis” does not merely “whip up” the vitality only
to lower it still further afterwards—but it ogives you a solid, sub-
stantial, definite amount of additional health and new life that will
remain for a long, long time after you have finished your bottle of
“Wincarnis .Don’t continue to suffer needlessly. Make up
your mind to get a bottle of “Wincarnis” to-day. Be
sure you get “Wincarnis.” Be particularly careful not to
be tempted to accept a wine tonic containing cocaine

or other drugs. “Win-
earnis” is the only wine
tonic of any repute
that does not contain
drugs. That is one
reason why over 10,000
doctors recommend it.
Will you try just a
bottle ?
“The Wine of Life."
Begin to Get Well TO-DAY.
To-day is the best day to begin to get well. Buy a bottle of “Wincarnis” from your Wine Merchant or Licensed Chemist or Grocer
and take advantage of the new health and new life “Wincarnis” offers you. But be sure you get “Wincarnis” ; don’t waste your
money and risk your health by accepting a substitute. “Wincarnis” is prepared only by Coleman & Co., Ltd., of Norwich, England.

If the Britisher swims out of debt on
drink, the Australian may yet smoke himself
out. A return handed to the House by Cus-
toms Minister Tudor shows that between
1909 and 1913, the number of cigarettes im-
ported into the Commonwealth rose from
44,242,000 to 06,810,400, w’hile the consump-
tion of the locally-made article sprang from
710,427,074 to 1,211,010,229. Import duty
amounts to £52,628, and excise to £419,282
—not far short of half a million a year.
In the struggle to give or to pretend to
give a preference to Britain, the new Com-
monwealth tariff falls into a few absurdities.
For instance, wood-pulp, out of which print-
ing paper is made, is fixed up this way:
Foreign, 5 per cent.; British, free. Now,
wood-pulp making is an industry peculiar to
a country with great forests of soft timber;
and as Britain hasn’t got them, it no more
makes wood pulp than Thargomindah makes
icebergs.
Of all the Yankee hot-air merchants who
have talked lately about the war, Taft has
had the worst luck. He had just announced
that “the United States would refuse to
allow the annexation of Canada or any un-
justly oppressive treatment” (by-Germany, of
course), when the report of a Congress debate
dropped in. And then it transpired that,
supposing Germany knocked out Britain,
France and Bussia, the mighty nation that
was going to stick it up single-handed has an
army of 85,000 and a militia of 120,000, that
60 per cent, of these failed to qualify in rifle
shooting, that even Mexico has more field
guns, that the torpedo supply of the Navy is
one for each tube, that for the deplorably
insufficient artillery the stock of ammunition
is still more deplorable, and that the Navy
(now third-rate) has only 58,000 men out of
its complement of 100,000.


Suffered Six Months. Used Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. Rash
Gone, They Also Healed Two
Boils on Neck, and Abscess.
“Amyville,” Castlereagh St., Singleton,
N. S. W. —“I unfortunately contracted the
barber's rash, which had spread all over my
face, and I suffered through this for about
six months. I was recommended by a
friend to try the Cuticura Remedies, which
I did with good results. I used Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment as directed,
and in about two or three weeks the rash
was gone. I tried other remedies before but
was unsuccessful with them all.
“I had two boils on my neck and I used
the Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
on them. I also had an abscess which had
given me great suffering for a week, and
;.rter using the Cuticura Remedies for two
or three days it broke and healed up well
after.” (Signed) A. E. Stewart, October,
1912.
FOR PIMPLES AND BLACKHEADS
The following is a most effective and eco-
nomical treatment: Gently smear the af-
fected parts with Cuticura Ointment, on the
end of the finger, but do not rub. Wash off
the Cuticura Ointment in five minutes with
Cuticura Soap and hot water and continue
bathing for some minutes. This treatment
is best on rising and retiring. At other times
use Cuticura Soap freely for the toilet and
bath, to assist in preventing inflammation,
irritation and clogging of the pores, a com-
mon cause of these distressing eruptions.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment are
sold throughout the world. Liberal sample
of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

AN/EMIA

TF' you are run-down, easily exhausted and out

A SENSE of satisfaction is experienced
every time one wears a pair of Ros-
tock boots, and from this consciousness
of their fine quality springs a natural and
legitimate pride. One feels that they will
contribute to ease and elegance on the most
exacting occasions, and one knows that their
high quality will be recognised every time
they are handled. This sense of satisfaction
is the inevitable effect of the choice leather
and beautiful work so conspicuous in every
pair of Bostocks. They are the cream of
imported boots.
Special shipments have recently arrived at the
leading stores, and ladies should call before the

The vicissitudes of a bangle finished a
chapter in the High Court the other day. A
Sydney lady some time ago lost a wrist
decoration valued at £35. It was discovered
in the establishment of a pawnbroker, who
declined to hand it over without the consent
of a man named Williams, the poppor. How
Williams came by it, and what he proposes
to do about it is not known, he having dis-
appeared like a beautiful dream or Jo-jo,
the dog-faced boy. There being a deadlock,
litigation began, with a District Court action
by the owner of the trinket. The pawn-
broker countered with an interpleader action,
and the result of that was in turn upset by
the lady. The scion of Israel then obtained
a prohibition against the District Court
Judge from a Supreme Court Judge, which
subsequently the Full Court outed. Next
the High Court took a hand and exploded
the Supreme Court Judge. (Knock off here
for refreshments.) The case now stands
that the lady is at liberty to commence an
action to prove she owns the bangle, the
pawnbroker to pay all costs. The ancient
sign of Lombardy is wilting at the prospect.

The switching-off of London’s brilliant
electric lights, so that no ground-plan guides
may be given to marauding Zeppelins nosing
out the British Museum and Westminster
Abbey, recalls that the pioneer electric
lights of London were displayed outside the
Gaiety Theatre no further back than 1878.
British scientists derided the new illuminant.
One of the greatest of them, Professor
Erasmus Wilson, said: “With regard to the
electric light, I think I might say without
fear of contradiction that when the Paris
Exhibition closes the electric light will close
with it, and very little more will be heard
about it.” It recalls the unlucky prediction
of Sir Roderick Murchison, the greatest
geologist of his time, that it wouldn’t be
worth while looking for gold in Bendigo at
a greater depth than 500 feet.

The Massey Government threatens to sool
Socialism on to the close-fisted monopoly
which has been for years running the Maori-
land fish trade; and, as usual, the anti-
Socialists have quite forgotten to join in a
howl of protest about it. Although the
waters of M.L. teem with splendid fish, the
supply has been so well regulated by the
monopolist for the benefit of himself that
the consumer has had to pay as much as
Bd. per lb. for his meat from the ocean pas-
tures. The same conditions have prevailed
in the oyster trade. Recently the Govern-
ment. although it knew that the remedy was
nationalisation, imported the services of an
expert from Canada, Professor Prince, who
told it what it knew already, with
the addendum that Maoriland, in addi-
tion to supplying its own demand plentifully
and cheaply, should be a big fish exporter.
As a beginning the Government has decided
to nationalise the industry, and incidentally
establish an oyster-canning establishment at
The Bluff.
* * * *
“Hamer”: The N.S.W. Government pays
an expensive official to give expert advice to
farmers regarding tobacco culture, in order
to encourage that industry, but what’s the
good? A man who went into the business
several years ago is now up against the pros-
pect of having no use for his plant for a year
or so. When he commenced operations there
were three buyers on the market prepared to
take his leaf. Later, as the result of the
usual understanding, there w r as only one
buyer, and, as you might expect, the price
gradually shrank, until finally the grower
was informed that he had better suspend
operations for a year or so, no more leaf
being required in the meantime. Despite this,
agriculturists, notably in the Yanco district,
are being induced to start tobacco-growing.
It is up to Ashford, N.S.W. Minister for
Agriculture, to make inquiries into the busi-
ness. If Australia can’t produce the right
sort of leaf, why encourage agriculturists to
make fools of themselves and w T aste the little
substance they’ve got? If Australia con
produce the right sort of leaf, why are tens
of thousands of pounds’ worth of foreign leaf
coming in? Or if it is merely a question of
properly curing the crop, how does the De-
partment propose to protect the grower when
he has learned the knack of it? It surely
doesn’t reckon lie’s protected when there’s
only one buyer in the field, does it?
THE QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AVe would ask our good friends, who state that
linseed meal makes their birds too fat, what would
happen if they gave a little less?
—Defiant advertisement.
No matter where you start you get round to war
and Empire sooner or later.
—Recent visitor, describing Australia's loyalty.
England! They wait your answer!
IVhat are you going to do?
Fusilier, gunner, lancer
All wait for a word from you!
Are they too fat, the layers?
Answer with “No” or with “Yes” !
Stuffed, they might still be stayers—
But what if you gave them less?
England, the world is waiting
Full-armed with lightning and steel!
Strike, strike these cowards prating
Foul words of Linseed Meal!
Speak fox - thine ancient glory.
And millions thy name will bless!
“Too fat!” so inns the story.
But what if you gave them lessf
England! as ships still issue
From every port of thine,
Guard well thy pi'eeious tissue
Like jewels all a-shine!
Fowls of the Empire, tell them
All's well 'neath your feather-dress,
That fed, you’ll lay, and shell them —
But not if they give you less!

STRENGTH COMES
not from What You Eat,
but from What You Digest.
Take onf
twenty MIK'iTES
BEFORE.
AND
ONE
V AFTER.
Most people eat all kinds of food without
discrimination. Pew stop to think what that
food does for them. This is the first turn on
the road to dyspepsia. Reckless disregard of
the proper choice of foods, rapid eating and
improper mastication are the unquestioned
causes of all stomach disorders.
There is nothing more revolting than a
dyspeptic stomach—the very vat for putrefac-
tion—sending forth its poisons throughout
the entire system, depressing the brain, be-
fouling the breath, souring the taste, deaden-
ing the muscles, incapacitating the liver and
kidneys for their work, debilitating the
heart, choking the lungs, and clogging the
bowels.
All of these disagreeable and dangerous condi-
tions are due to the improper digestion of food
and the consequent assimilation of poison. What
else can be expected? If the food lies in the
stomach, if the system is constipated, fermenta-
tion is the natural outcome. It shows itself in
sour water risings, belchings, heartburn and pain-
ful breathing.
There is only one way to relieve this condition.
If the stomach refuses to digest your food, put
something into it that will. Dr. Sheldon’s Diges-
tive Tabules are nothing but digestives. They
work when the stomach will not.
These TABULES are sold everywhere at 1/6 for a tin containing 36 Tabules,
or 2/6 for a tin containing EIGHTY TABULES. Buy a tin, eat a good square
meal, and then take the TABULES according to directions, and note the result.
You will forget all about it if you are not careful, for there will be NO I AIN or
disturbance, and the food will be DIGESTED just as it used to be when your
STOMACH was WELL and STRONG. Furthermore, your stomach will soon be
restored again, if you keep on taking them, just as thousands upon thousands of
other stomachs have been by the sole and exclusive use of DR. SH ELDON
DIGESTIVE TABULES.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SMITH is a very stupid man;
He lives next door to me ;
He has no settled scheme or plan
Of domesticity.
He does not own a gramophone,
Nor rush for morning trams,
His garden paths are overgrown,
He seldom entertains.
In all our staid suburban street
He strikes the one false note.
He goes about in slippered teet,
And seldom wears a coat.
He shows no taste in furniture,
He never goes to church ;
His ways our district prim and pure
Seem, somehow, to besmirch.
I don’t know how he earns his biead,
’Tis said he paints or writes ;
But frequently, I’ve heard it said,
He works quite late at nights.
His servant told the girl we’ve got
He makes a lot of pelf.
It seems a pity he will not
Strive to improve himself.
She’s quite a pretty girl, his wife.
Our women-folk declare
It is a shame she spoiled her life
With such a perfect bear.
And yet she seems quite satisfied
With this peculiar man ; _
And says, with rather foolish pride,
He is Bohemian.
He has the crudest views about
Respectability;
I’ve often heard him laugh and shout
On Sundays after tea;
While our select suburban clan
Pass him the stony stare.
Smith is a very stupid man,
He doesn’t seem to care.
He will not join our tennis club,
Nor come to may’ral balls,
Nor meet the neighbors in a rub
At bridge, nor pay them calls.
He just delights to scoff and sneer,
And feign to be amused
At ev’rything we hold most dear —-
What wonder he’s abused?
Although he’s ostracised a deal
He never makes a fuss;
I sometimes think he seems to feel
He ostracises us!
But that, of course, is quite absurd ;
And, risking the disgrace,
I sometimes say a kindly word
When I pass by his place.
But still, although one likes to keep
One’s self a bit select,
And not be, so to speak, too cheap,
I’m “broad” in that respect.
So oft, on sultry Summer eves,
I waive all diffidence,
And chat across the wilted leaves
That garb our backyard fence.
But. oh, his talk is so absurd!
His notions are so crude.
Such drivel I have seldom heard;
His mode of speech is rude.
Pie mentions “stomach” in a bark
You’d hear across the street.
He lacks those “little ways” that mark
A gentleman discreet.
And when I speak of great affairs
His mind becomes a blank.
He shows no interest in the cares
Of folk of noble rank.
And should we chat of politics
He sneers at Parliament,
And says the modern party tricks
Were by the Devil sent.
It seems he has some foolish scheme
To right all social wrong;
Some silly plan, some idle dream
To raise the fallen throng.
I tell him if we change our plan
All enterprise must end —
Smith is a very stupid man;
He does not comprehend.
Good books, as I have often said,
He mentions with disdain.
Marie Corelli he’s not read,
Garvice, nor yet Hall Caine.
He talks of writers most obscure:
Like Virgil, Carlyle, Kant,
Whose works no scholar could endure.
His reading must be scant.
In art he is a perfect dunce,
That’s plainly evident.
I recollect I showed him once
A Christmas supplement.
He asked me if it was a joke.
Although the thing was grand!
I knew the moment that he spoke
Smith didn’t understand.
Pie lacks all soul for music, too;
He hates the gramophone ;
And when we play some dance-tune nei
I’ve often heard him groan.
Pie says our music gives him sad,
Sad thoughts of slaughtered things.
I think Smith is a little mad;
Nice thoughts to me it brings.
Now, I have quite a kindly heart;
Good works I do not stint;
Last week I sooke to Smith apart,
And dropped a gentle hint.
He will Jbe snubbed, I told him flat,
By neighbors round about,
Unless he wears a better hat
On Sundays, when he’s out.
Last Sunday morn he passed my place
About the hour of four;
A smile serene was on his face, .
And on his head he wore
The most dilapidated hat
That I have ever seen.
“This ought to keep ’em off the mat,”
He said. What did he mean?
I wish that Smith was not so dense.
He seems to have no vice;
He’s educated —in a sense— ■■
And could become quite nice.
Still, there’s a certain “genteel” brand
That marks the cultured man.
Smith doesn’t seem to understand ;.
He’s such a stupid man!

A Widow Three Times.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f I HE hotel people put me in the room
next to where the servants slept. I
had been asleep, but I woke with the
hum of women’s voices, and feeling that I
was so tired for sleep that I’d die if I didn’t
lose consciousness somehow. Then I began
to realise that it was the women’s voices
that made me so feverish. I was almost
singing out: “Shut up and go to sleep!”
when I remembered that they were ladies,
and that I had been advised to try and be a
gentleman. One voice was young and fresh.
The other w y as thick with worldly experience
—the voice of a woman who Knew Things.
“But Dick is not that sort of cove,” said
the young, fresh voice.
“What do you know of each other?” said
the worldly voice. “’Cepting that you have
the sun shinin’ out of yer, and he wears
pink socks. Wait till yous are married a
few munce, an’ you’ve got tired of livin’ up
to his opinion of yer, an’ he don’t care
whether you admire his socks or not. Wait
till he comes home for dinner, an’ you an’
the woman next door have bin talkin’ too
long about yer aches an’ pains, an’ he has
to go back to work with a bit of bread and jam
in his ’and. Then you’ll know what men are.
I should know. I’m a widder three times.”
“How can you, Lena !”
“Well, I know. That’s why,” said the
experienced voice. “Of course I don’t want
to discourage yer.”
“Of course not.”
“But it’s as well to know what men are
beforehand.”
Then there was silence for a while.
“All the good I knows of men,” went on
the voice of the woman who Knew Things,
“is not much, ’cepting that we can’t do with-
out them, an’ when we gets one for our very
own we’re on’y gettin’ what we deserves.”
“I suppose there are good ones as well as
bad ones,” said the innocent voice.
“No, there ain’t; an’ a good job. If yer
really did meet a good man an’ married ’im,
it would be awfully monotonous livin’ with
’im. There’s on’y the bad an’ the not quite
so bad, an’ give me the bad one of the two,
as he’ll give me some occupation' like the
flea on the dog that keeps him from remem-
berin’ he is a dog, as the sayin’ is. But
there are three holy terrors that I wouldn’t
marry if they were the last men on earth.”
“Who are they, Lena?”
“There’s the man who grows a beard but
shaves his upper lip; an’ there’s the man
who is always rubbin’ his hands together
when he meets yer; an’ there’s the cove with
pretty lips—‘kissin’ lips’ I calls ’em. The
first one is a shinin’ light an’ a public bene-
factor, but he is ’ard as iron with his own
fambly. The man who is always washin’
his ’ands without soap an’ water, like a
shopwalker who says: ‘What department,
madam?’ an’ all the time he’s wonderin’
whether you’ll spend £l5 or give a lot of
trouble for a reel of cotton —is worse than
the cove who won’t grow ’air on his top
lip. You never knows what devilment he’s
up to. As for the other cove —well, I
wouldn’t trust him two seconds with another
woman unless I put ’im in a straight west-
coat first.”
“Were your three husbands like those?”
“No. Whatever their faults was they
had good, honest, ugly faces. I was never
particularly attracted to your good-lookin’
coves. Not but what I had a ’ard time with
them more or less. But marriage is all right
if you only manages them in the right way.
I ’ad to manage my blokes differently. Tom
couldn’t bear contradiction. If he said black
was white I learned to agree with him. He
was a boundary-rider. We went to
Wantagidery, an’ we lived on an out-
station. First day he said at dinner, ‘Why
the ’ell don’t you put salt on the meat?' an’
he got up an’ went into the skillion to get
some. The people before us used to keep
everything in treacle tins to keep away the
ants. He came back, an’ he put some of the
salt on mine as well, an’ I thought it tasted
bitter, an’ I said, ‘This isn’t salt.’ An’ he
said, ‘Do you think I don’t know salt when I
sees it?’ I didn’t say anything, but I didn’t
eat any of it by good luck.”
“What was it, Lena?”
“Strychnine,” said the thick voice. “He
was my third.”
“Will you marry again, Lena?”
“It depends. I’m not keen on it, but if
the right cove comes along it’s as good as
bein’ slavey in a pub. There’s one thing
you want to remember when you gets
married, Rose—if you wants some money to
buy something new, don’t come straight at
him for a pound or two. Beat about the
bush, as the sayin’ is.”
“How do you mean?”
“Well, like this. S’posin’ yer wants a
hat. Don’t say, ‘I wants a ’at, Dick.’ Say,
‘My, you do look bad this mornin’. What-
ever is wrong with you?’ He’ll say, ‘Oh,
I’m all right.’ An’ you say, ‘lf I was you
I wouldn’t go to work to-day. I’m sure
you’ve got what Mrs. Smith has. It’s goin’
about.’ An’ he’ll probably ask what is wrong
with Mrs. Smith, an’ you’ll say,‘’Ow do I
know when I can’t go an’ see her?’ An’
he’ll say. ‘Why can’t you go an’ see her?’
An’ you’ll say, ‘Because I’m such a sight
with my hat. I look a regular fright in it.
Everybody knows me by it half a mile off.
Not that I care bein’ a laughin’ stock for
meself, but it’s you I’m thinkin’ about, Dick,
because I know it must be miserable for
you to know that everybody is laughin’ at
me.’ I’m only sayin’ a hat, Rose, but you
can get most anything that way.”
“Oh, it won’t matter tome. Dick isn’t mean.”
“No, some coves ain’t,” said the thick
voice, reflectively. “Poor Arthur had his
faults, but he wasn’t mean either.”
“What was Arthur’s fault?”
“Oh, Arthur believed in jewey jitsy.”
“What’s that?”
“It takes two to do it. One has to jewey,
an’ the other to jitsy.”
“Is it a game?”
“It’s not exactly a game, unless it is for
the one that jeyreys.” .
“I don’t understand.”
“It’s knowin’ ’ow t,o upset a big, strong
man though you are only a little, weak
woman. That’s jewey jitsy.”
“But you can’t do, that.”
“I know you can’t. It’s on’y a theory

“Well, you can’t help yourself very well

that it s lor the benefit of the weak people,
but it s always the strong people who

that the one who jitsies has to let herself.

quite pleased with himself. If it was called
anything else but jewey jitsy I’d a got a
divorce easy.
“Still it’s nice to know that your husband
knows how to take care of himself,” said Rose
But can they take care of themselves?”
asked Lena, “it’d have been all right for
Arthur it lie had stuck to jewey jitsy on me,
but one day he met a man at the White

but j.rom wliat I could make out they both

There was a little pause.
“Arthur never jeweyed after that,” added
Rena, thoughtfully.
You wouldn t think he would give up
because lie met a man better than himself,”
said Rose. “Dick wouldn’t.”
“I don’t think Arthur would have either

It seemed that that would finish the good-
mght talk, but after a long silence Lena

“Was Jack your first V”
“Yes.”
“What happened to him?”
“Nuthin’ happened to him. He died,

Hose showed no further interest, and a
long silence ensued. Then Lena spoke again
she were more asleep than awake.
It was some Latin word he died of,” she
said. “The doctor said that if he couldn’t
drink a glass of water and blow his nose at
the same time he would never get better. I
said to Jack at the time that he might have
said right away that he was incurable as to

Hell on Earth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was hot and dusty enough outside the
works; inside—well... -
All day long plumes of thin, brown
smoke streamed from the stacks. From the
very tallest came an occasional cloud of
white steam, telling of the valves that eased
the enormous boilers when the pressures
mounted under the dogging of the flames.
At night the stacks cheered up all the
countryside, and when the blast was at its
height you could read the quaint, scrawly
advertisements on the straggling fences at
the roadside.
We were allowed inside only after several
consultations and inspections. The time-
keeper viewed us with a cold and hostile
eye, and the little knot of dust-slirouded
men outside the gates advised us urgently
to put our cigars out before we entered;
otherwise they would not be responsible for
the consequences. Cigars were thrown
away, but the one Scot in the party who
had only just “lit up” cannily extinguished
his weed and put it into one of his waist-
coat pockets. Then we entered, in a snow-
storm of impalpable powder, and the roar
of the machinery hit us like a solid thing.
Overhead, GO or SO feet up, ran a spidery
railway on trestles, and every 30 seconds
came a thing that looked like a gigantic
steel crab, cautiously feeling its way along
the curve until— Click-Crash! At the
poppet-head-like “loop” the crab momen-
taiiiy stopped, rocked and fell backwards
like a girl in a faint; in its fall discharging
about Jocwt. of limestone into a shoot that
received it with a yell and sent it hurtling
down amid loud and continuous applause
into the arms of a truck that then jolted
onwards to the grinding-mill. The crab-
iilce conveyer overhead, without pausing,
swooped round the loop in a graceful semi-
circle, and scudded away throuch the air
across a big dam nearly half a mile off,
white its successor went through the per-
formance detailed above and tore after it
iLJZ?" a m e, ' f a- Ct ex . am Ple of “follow your
ieadei. Treading gingerly over huge piles
of steel and stone; plates, ingots, bars,
(roughs, cups and cylinders of adamantine
hardness and Titanic size, we came to the
mighty shed where (it seemed) Antaeus,
imceladus and Briareus were serving their
sentences for the famous rebellion against
Jove. Amid a noise which reminded one of
the 40-feet breakers thundering on the rocks
of the storm-swept Leeuwin, we stole gin-
gerly in—-and stopped ! At our very feet,
in a pit like to that of Avernus, a roaring,
raging, chained devil was bounding up and
down in rage—smashing and crashing stones
against the sides of the pit with a force and
energy that shook the ground. The pit was
lined and shod with solid steel, inches thick,
and the smoke of the tortured stone ascended
in a thin, acrid-smelling steam. Where
the small bones and fragments went we
could not see, but everything disappeared
as the dancing fiend went madly round and
round his lair. Going a few paces in, we
saw a dozen gigantic bodies, or cylinders, of
steel, rotating steadily in clouds of dust;
and from them came a thunderous booming
sound, accompanied by a continuous and
almost terrifying “Thud-thud-thud” that
seemed to shake the scantlings of that enor-
mous shed .' Each of those revolving Titans
carried in his belly tons and tons of chrome-
steel balls about as big as a water-polo
ball; and. of course, as the cylinders swiftly
rolled round, the balls inside rose and fell
and fell and rose, like gigantic hailstones
rebounding—one from another and all from
the bottom of the cylinder! A rattling,
rasping, ague-stricken devil shook out a
barrowload of broken stone into a hopperful
of clay, and the mixture was promptly
dumped into a gap in the floor, where a con-
veyer took it swiftly overhead and dropped it
into the feeding apparatus that supplied the
grinding Titans with their meal—“meal,”
indeed, for that is the technical name for
it whence it was taken by a most ingeni-
ous system to the incineratory. As we
stepped out of the great shed another
chained and caged devil in his pit was
thudding like Beelzebub macerating sinners
for All-Devils’ Dav!
The adjoining shed was full of machinery.
Everything was going round and round or
up and down ; what was not doing that was
sliding to and fro. Our guide swore that
there was a quarter of a million pounds’
worth of plant in the shed, and so appalling
was the noise and movement that even the
Scotsman forgot to question this fine and
large estimate. We left that place under
the impression that we had struck the
engine-room of the Mauretania which, some-
how, had run ashore in the Ultimo Power
House and got “mixed up.”
All this time the impalpable powder was
getting in its deadly work. It got worse
when we crossed into the opposite shed,
where they told us they bagged the finished
article ; and by the time we reached one of
the receiving sheds (which happened to be
empty and was getting a clean-up—a rare
thing in that place) we looked like millers
after a hard day’s struggle with the flour-
bags. Here they showed us a machine that
dumped the cement, weighed and measured
—I had nearly said counted —it, and then
checked off the number of sacks filled. The
stuff was brought down to this part of the
works by an Archimedean screw about 300 ft.
long, and then raised to the roof, or what
answered for the roof, and shot into the
blessed calculating-machine below. Through
the fog we could see the machine working,
with the ease and celerity of a cash-register
which in a sense it is, as it accounts for
every bag of cement manufactured.
Like the gentleman in the New Testament
who was alleged to have left the best wine
to the last, our guicje had left the most
thrilling sight to the last. After examining the
piles and piles of old and worn-out material
which lay on every hand —especially the
worn-out balls which had been reduced in
many instances to poly-angled lumps 0 f
metal about as big as a walnut —we made
for the furnaces. Ph w! Hot wasn’t the word'
We got our first taste of it when exploring
the cavernous recesses under the huge tubu-
lar bodies that began at the wall of a huge
shed to the right and ended in the queer-
shaped flaring smoke-stacks on the left. Be-
tween the right and the left might have been
120 ft., and all about the floor between were
strange, groaning moving gears, and chains,
and transporters, and conveyers, and pullers,
a»ud beltings, and shaftings, which took sonic
dodging. The heat struck downward as we
moved along, and here and there we caught
a glimpse of falling showers and sprays of
burning fire —the incinerated coal and' lime
and “meal” as it fell out of the furnaces.
Climbing up a gigantic staging we came
to the mighty kilns themselves— vast
cylinders of steel, painted red, and lined
with fire-proof brick, slowly turning, turn-
ing, turning on their enormous bearings. The
biggest one was about 126 ft. long and 12ft.
in diameter, and it weighed about 350 tons’
They were all tilted a little, so that any-
thing in them, as they turned, would work
down towards the end where the white-hot
slag dropped. A man with a thing like a
large slate—only, instead of slate there was
blue (poison-bottle blue) glass in the frame
—gave us it and bade us look in. We looked.
What we saw was a weird pale-blue world
of jim-jams, slowly rotating and falling into
ruin, yet constantly being renewed. The
world itself, as it went round, kept on
crumbling. A continent, or three or four
ranges of mountains, would slide down into
a sea insufferably disturbed. Then the next
continent would topple over and fold into
nothingness! The whole atmosphere was
whirling and swirling in an ecstasy of
motion as the gigantic air-blast roared
through the flaming furnace. The blast
spread and swayed and played through the
gases of that belching inferno just as the
fiery sword played round the gates of Eden.
Showers of incandescent material kept on
erupting into the atmosphere, and as they
fell into the pit it seemed as if countless
hordes of flaming devils rose up and grasped
them in that living fire. These, of course,
were the supplies of material which would
eventually emerge from that heat of 3000
degrees in the form of slag or ash, which,
again ground up, would become the plain
ordinary Portland cement of commerce. But
at that stage, and in that atmosphere, they
looked like the homing of the Lost Souls
to the Abode of Everlasting Fire. It was
an inspiriting spectacle and the Scotsman
waxed enthusiastic to the man with the blue
glass. “Losh, mon,” said he, “yon’s a bonny
sicht! The bur-rning fiery furnace of
Nebuchadnezzar was a fule to ’t! Think o’
yere sins, laddie, think o’ yere sins! There's
no eight hours' dag in Hell."
Now, who but a Presbyterian would ever
connect Hell with a rotating blast furnace?

What a Father
Says :
“I like Remington?UMC Arms
and Ammunition because I want
my children to enjoy the benefits of knowledge
in the use of fire arms. Not only will this
afford them much sport and recreation, but,
should occasion demand, to defend their home
or their honour. Accidents in handling fire arms
come through ignorance of them and I want my
children to know how to use them. And for all
of the above reasons I want them to have arms
that are modern, that have a solid breech and
ammunition that I know is reliable and accurate.”

there is no proprietary preparation which has achieved such an enormous success
as Beecham's Pills. And it is worthy of note that their remarkable popularity
is not confined to one class of people nor to one country their splendid reputation
is world-wide. The explanation of this extraordinary success lies in the fact that
Beecham’s Pills always do good. They are specially prepared for dealing with
disorders of the digestive organs, and the relief they afford is both speedy and
sure. “Whether the trouble is due' to sluggish liver and constipation or an
enfeebled state of the stomach, an intelligent use of
Beecbam’s fills
will soon correct the faulty conditions. By gently eliminating all unhealthy
Accumulations, and stimulating the stomach to normal efficiency, a great im-
provement in the general health is quickly brought about. The appetite
improves—discomfort after meals disappears and there is no more flatulence or
biliousness. A box of Beecham's Pills is an excellent investment. It pays to
take them. A trial is all that is necessary to convince anyone that as a cure for,
and safeguard against, digestive ailments, Beecham's Pills
Are secettd_ro jVotie.

No need to be foolish
just because it*s Xmas
Every sovereign contains twenty whole shillings at Christmas time just the same
as all the rest of the year. Good value to the purchaser of presents means good
value to the recipient.
Shop until your feet are “ready to drop off”—and you find ho better value for
money than the Onoto self-filling safety fountain pen. Nor will you find a present
which is at once more tasteful or of more permanent service.
A good fountain pen is. always acceptable. An Onoto is thrice acceptable,
because not. only is it a pen of unsurpassed quality, but it has the two added
advantages: 1. It fills itself in a flash from any ink-supply. 2. It cannot leak,
because a simple turn of the “head” renders the Onoto a sealed tube.
The Onoto needs no filler. It cleans itself in filling. It can be carried in any
position without ever shedding a drop of ink.
Have you ten relatives or friends you want to make happy? Get TEN Onotos!
Make a note to get the all British

him to see to the posting. The Onoto is designed with, a nib to suit every style
of handwriting, and if the nib selected is unsuitable it will be exchanged.

The
Importance
of *
Efficient
Insulation!
The importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings are fully borne out by actual test, and, further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
