FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

HIS BOOKS
The Australian Novel
It is often said that Australia’s best
novelists go abroad and write about
people in other countries because Aus-
tralia is dull. The cities lack glamor, and
nothing happens in the bush. Yet some
of the greatest novels in literature would
have been equally great with Australian
characters and a bush background.
“Madame Bovary,” for example. We
produce plenty of Madame Bovarys ; un-
fortunately, we haven’t produced any
Flauberts. Hundreds of novels arrive
at The Bulletin office from overseas
every year, and nearly all but the worst
(the worst being usually those which
depend for most of their allure on pic-
tures of life in expensive London and
New York night clubs and restaurants,
Riviera hotels, and so on) would have
been just as interesting and meritorious
if they had been about Australians. This
applies equally to British, American and
Continental publications.
The foregoing is not to say, of course,
that some Australians, living in Australia,
are not doing first-class work. In the
writer’s opinion, the best novel of horror,
the best animal story and two of the
best war-books of recent years have been
by Australians who are now in Aus-
tralia. But, speaking broadly, our litera-
ture is suffering from an inferiority com-
plex. Consider a couple of recently-
published best-sellers—one French, one
English—whose principal characters live,
talk and behave like Australians
whom most of us have met either per-
sonally or in the law reports of the news-
papers.
Social Types
Lovat Dickson is publishing at 7s. 6d.
a volume a translation by Warre B.
Wells of Jules Romains’s “Men of Good
Will.” The translation is so masterly
that the reader forgets for pages at a
time that the original is in French. Like
Balzac and Proust, Romains surveys
every class. How closely the Parisians
in Book 111 ( Children’s Loves ) resemble
the inhabitants of Sydney or Melbourne!
The students are own brothers to our
undergraduates. They are mostly poor
—sons of schoolmasters, farmers and the
like —and their conversation is that of
careerists of their sort the world over.
They are concerned chiefly with things
of the mind related to the examinations
on which their future careers will depend.
And with girls. One of the most en-
chanting chapters is that in which Jallez
describes his innocent passion, as a child
of 14, for a schoolgirl of the same age.
Thousands of Australian undergrads, have
experienced his emotions, but no Aus-
tralian writer has expressed them yet.
Australia has had homicidal perverts
like Quinette, who figures in the two
previous books, and who, in this one, is
driven to offer himself as a police spy by
an urge analogous to that which often
brings a murderer to the scene of his
crime, or forces him to talk of his crime.
“Twisted Clay” is the only Australian
novel, so far as the writer knows, in
which one of these unhappy beings is
handled with complete understanding.
Duroure, the artillery colonel, who
talks rubbish about the way the next war
will be fought; Allory, the bogus critic ;
the newspapermen, politicians, policemen
—all are as familiar as the people in the
house next door.
“Nice” Murderesses
Mrs. Belloc Lowndes is a pastmistress
of suspense. The tempo of her stories
is slow ; but fate is slow. There is in-
evitability in the way her over-feminised,
under-sexed young women drift into
difficult positions, and then into murder.
In the last two novels by her which were
reviewed on this Page (“Letty Lynton”
and “Jenny Newstead”), the central
figures were beautiful girls who found
life too much for them, and turned to
crime. The same girl reappears in An-
other Man’s Wife (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.).
Delia Seaton adores her husband, the
handsome Test cricketer, and doesn’t
dream of being
unfaithful to him
till he loses his
money and is
crippled. Then
her thoughts turn
to another man.
So she leaves a sleeping-draught at her
husband’s bedside, and almost persuades
herself that she is sorry when he takes
an overdose. But the other man has a
wife. Presently Delia finds an oppor-
tunity to poison the wife. Through it
all she remains kind, considerate, ami-
able, everything that women call “nice.”
Mrs. Lowndes has a kind of affection for
her murderesses ; or it may be that she
forgives them because she understands
them so well. Anyhow, she usually
allows them, as she does Delia, to make
their exits without shame or suffering.
In Another Man’s Wife, as in Chil-
dren’s Loves, there is hardly a situation
that mightn’t have arisen in Australia, or
a character who mightn’t have been born
here. What is it that differentiates the
works of this excellent,* though limited,
English writer and of the,. Trench master
so sharply from anything that is being
done by Australians here or overseas?
In the first place, they are without pre-
tentiousness. They don’t try to show
what clever people they are, how much
they know and how beautifully they can
write ; they keep in the background, and
their characters reveal themselves in
actions and remarks which are sometimes
intelligent, sometimes stupid. Their
knowledge of life and of the natures of
the people they describe is shown in the
negative manner of the black-and-white
artist who knows what lines to leave
out; Romains makes no mistakes in his
huge canvas, Mrs. Lowndes Very few in
her little one. Knowledge is the basis of
literary power; knowledge not only of
the secret processes of the human heart,
but of the behavior and social, political
and religious conventions and prejudices
of the people described. The bad writer
is like a movie director; he doesn’t
bother about the mistakes, provided he
can satisfy the 90 p.c. to whom mistakes
mean nothing.
How Not to Do It
Ringmaster, by A. B. .Sherlock (Heri-
tage ; 7s. 6d.), is about an Australian
middleweight who finishes champion of
the world without a defeat.
The author has no more than a movie
directors knowledge of championship
boxing,' and he knows nothing whatever
about boxing in Australia. Neill Frost’s
manager, Daintry, is heir to a dukedom,
and talks like it ; and his charge’s dic-
tion is no less correct. When Neill —as
an unknown—-has his first fight in Sydney
it is against “the best Yank middleweight
we’ve had out here for years. He’s won
every contest so far.” On the great
night: —
Conley, in a flamboyant robe, came
gaily down the aisle with a following of
five. But Neill and Daintry had long
ago decided that one second was enough.
Neill does everything that no Australian
pug has ever done or ever will do-—has
himself ballyhooed as “a fully-qualified
doctor who had successfully reset a spar-
ring partner’s broken nose” ; paints in
water-colors, and in Sydney “visits the
Art Galleries and spends hours ponder-
ing problems of light and shade” ; takes
a long holiday in the country, and (at a
time when he can boast a more impressive
record than Vince Dundee has now, or
than Les Darcy ever had) agrees to meet
“that new Melbourne fellow, Doughty.”
As a story it is quite a good effort, but
as a picture of the life which the author
is trying to portray it is preposterous.
Successful novelists are never tired of
giving priceless advice to beginners in
their art. It is, “Only write about people
you know inside out,” and it is offered
inferentially in every book they write.

“The Bulletin” v. Australian Glass
An advertisement in the Melbourne “Age”
of December 12, 1933, headed
AUSTRALIAN GLASS
Manufacturer’s reply to criticism
and signed by the General Manager and
Director of the Australian Glass Manu-
facturers Company, Limited, contained an
inference that because the Company did
not advertise in “The Bulletin,” that paper
made an attack upon the operations of
the Company.
I now have “The Bulletin’s” assurance that
such was not the case, and that the
• Editorial policy of “The Bulletin” is in no
way dictated or influenced in the slightest
degree by the Advertising Staff of the
paper, and that the Editorial Staff of “The
Bulletin” expressly refrains from having
any knowledge of the business transactions
of the Advertising Department.
I therefore unreservedly withdraw any
statements appearing in the said advertise-
ment which might reflect on the good
name of “The Bulletin.”
E. A. SMITH,
Acting General Manager,
AUSTRALIAN GLASS MANUFACTURERS CO., LTD.
humously in 1931. They are presented in
chronological order, and are invaluable
accordingly as a guide to Lawrence’s
development as a literary artist.
Some of the earlier tales might almost
have been written by Chekhov. “The
Thorn in the Flesh,” a picture of bar-
rack life in Germany, and “Daughters
of the Vicar,” in which a mining village
and its inhabitants are re-created so that
you feel you could touch them, are
obviously based on direct observation.
“Fannie and Annie,” the story of a
lady’s maid who returns to her native
village to marry a collier, has the same
quality of concrete reality. But as you
delve deeper into the volume something
intrudes between the reader and the thing
presented. The writing becomes easier,
the passion of the writer more intense ;
it seems to sob and sway and rend
itself ; but the more it does so, the more
the characters and even the scenery begin
to slip away. You view them through a
veil that becomes steadily denser as it
becomes more highly colored. Finally,
in the novelettes you do not feel you
are in the presence of human beings at
all, but of elemental forces. You forget
the names of the characters and even
their sexes. They wrestle and fight and
scratch at each other’s souls and lacerate
each other’s bodies in a sort of sound-
less battle. In this phantasmagoria dia-
logue and the objects of ordinary life
appear as irrelevancies. The landscapes
are not real landscapes at all, but visions
seen in mystical ecstasy.
What had happened to Lawrence? It
seems that he had become discontented
with the role of realist and had become
a Man with a Mission, the Messiah of
a new order in the realm of sexual rela-
tions. Revolting from a world given
over to materialism he sought to revalue
love and destroy its traditional property
basis. Men and women must love along
the lines of their biological natures, with-
out regard for the conventions. The
effect on his art was to turn it into some-
thing suspiciously like tract-writing. The
message of his tracts is not stated but in-
herent, as a rule. But in “Mother and
Daughter,” one of the last of the stories,
he seems to be painting an illustration to
a chapter from a work on psycho-
analysis. It is needless to say that this
is a job that a Freud can always do
better than the literary artist, for the
literary artist is concerned with depict-
ing how human beings behave, not with
what their behavior means.
If the above analysis is right, Law-
rence was a sort of inverted Tolstoy.
Until he became a moralist Tolstoy
wrote works of acknowledged greatness.
When he became a moralist he wrote
tracts which are now forgotten. Never-
theless, Lawrence’s writings should
prove a mine to the future student of
modern society. In them are to be found,
described in the burning language of a
poet, every inversion, perversion, intro-
version, phobia, obsession and psycho-
pathological condition that afflicted the
minds of his troubled generation.
M. G. S.
Orthodoxy Hits Back
There are nine chapters to Orthodoxy
Sees It Through (Arthur Barker ; 7s. 6d.)
and a special Foreword by the editor.
Sydney Dark, in which he condemns
Modernism and the “intellectual in-
dividualists” who have the temerity to
inquire into things which are too high
for them.
Mr. Dark is “amazingly amused” at H.
G. Wells, also at “the Russells, the Hux-
leys and the Joads of this world,” and
their assumption that those “who call
themselves Christians are either humbugs
or half-wits.” Mr. Arnold Lunn, who
provides the contribution on the New
Religions, is even more severe upon
Wells, and he dubs the Huxleys disciples
of the “Just-Say School” who “do not
argue—they tell you.” He holds that the
Modernist starts out on his search after
Truth with his reason in chains, and so
comes to a morally sticky end.
One of the best-written chapters is by
Father Darcy, who scarifies the New
Morality. This writer is even more severe
on the New Moralists than is Mr. Lunn
on the Modernists. He indignantly
denies the New Gospel that human
actions are the product of economic con-
ditions, and delivers resounding blows at
those who would fracture or even ease
the marriage-tie.
The only woman writer—-Miss Ruth
Kenyon—deals with the New Economics.
She presents ably and fairly the progress
of the war between capitalist and Com-
munist economics, and urges a new
system of Christian economics—recalling
the old gibe about Christianity being the
perfect creed if people would only prac-
tise it. Orthodoxy insists that “goods
shall be used to serve the ends of good,”
hard economics being relegated to second
or even to third place.
Two other arresting chapters are
Orthodoxy and the new Societies, (J. G.
Lockhart) and that on The Universe
(Rev. A. E. Baker). From eighteenth-
century Liberalism to twentieth-century
Leninism Mr. Lockhart passes in brief
review the tasks, the failures and the
successes of Orthodoxy vis-a-vis the
Revolutionary Spirit. He contends that
the League of Nations itself, if it is to
live, must seek to practise orthodox
tenets, not merely give them lip-service.
This, it may be observed, is no small
order. Mr. Baker lays himself out to
tackle the New Universe and its pro-
claimers. His is the hardest task of the
lot: he is contending with Science, on
the one hand, and the Spirit of the Age
on the other. But it is excellent reading.
Other contributors include the Rev. Dr.
Kirk (the New Psychology), Martin Shaw
(the New Music), Douglas Jerrold (the
New History) and R. Ellis Roberts (the
New Novel).
O. C.
Pamela Travers
It must be ten years since Pamela
Travers went to London. In her youth
here she was versatile and skilful, and
the overshrewd suggested that she was
just another pen-name for Frank Morton.
Steadily, through the last ten years,
Pamela Travers has been proving that
she is nobody’s pen-name.
Apart from the breezy journalism on
which she lives —her “Letters from
Russia” will soon appear in book form—
Pamela Travers has been uttering her
own vision of life, using original verse-
forms of increasing subtlety and power.
In recent decades, many poets writing in
English have taken Verlaine’s broad hint
that rhyme should be suggested, not em-
phasised. The reader should be made
aware of a flickering, rhymed pattern, not
jarred by hammer-strokes. W. H. Davies
has sometimes chosen to rhyme sidelong:
And when the landlord’s merry daughter
Heard their rough jokes and shrieked with
laughter,
They threw a muffler of rare fur
That hid her neck from ear to ear.
Then Wilfred Owen, in the couplets of
his powerful “Strange Meeting,” used
assonance throughout, instead of rhyme:
groined and groaned. Later still, Ber-
tram Fliggins, in his “Confrontation,” has
used the half-rhyme for a pause, nature
followed by date.
Directed towards a new bondage, a new
freedom, these devices and a score of
others are all used to-day by poets
capable of the most exacting Spenserian
stanzas or intricate Gilbertian pattern.
Among them is Pamela Travers. Gently
daring, not in the matter of rhyme only
but in the wayward metre, she writes a
girl’s “Prayer in a Field,” with stanzas
like these, the first and last:
Saint Anthony, my little cow
with the sedate and comely air,
you remember? Her horns were round
and bent like thorn boughs, and there were
dun shadows patched upon her grey,
that when she moved
along the bushy dappled ways
you could not tell her from the wood;
....Have you no girl, Saint Anthony,
to bend back into Heaven’s lawn
and kiss until your mouth is dry
for a bowl of milk or spring water?
If you’d been under a girl’s cloak,
Saint Anthony, now
you’d know the thirst in Michael’s throat
and bring me back my little cow.
This was one of four poems by Pamela
Travers in Alide Monro’s striking new
collection, Recent Poetry. To possess
more of her work you need to have been
an assiduous clipper of reviews, such as
the short-lived, masterly “Irish States-
man” and the current “New English
Weekly.” Long ago, her published verse
will have amounted to a bookful, but it
seems she is her own severest publisher’s
reader, rejecting and postponing. The
first book of her selected poems will be
important.

A Satchel of Books
Dorothy Whipple’s Greenbanks, which
was a Book Society choice in 1932 and
has since run into several editions, has
now been added to Murray’s Fiction
Library. Those who have not yet made
the acquaintance of the Ashton family
should take this opportunity of meeting
them. The book sells at 2s.
Robertson and Mullens have published
The 38th Battalion, A.1.F., by Eric
Fairey, at 2s. 6d. This Victorian bat-
talion was formed in March, 1916, and
its training was done in the bush near
Bendigo. It reached Le Havre before
the end of November, went up the line
at once, and entered the trenches in the
Houplines area on December 1. The
battalion’s history is traced in detail from
that date to its last fight on Sunday,
September 29, 1918. There is a full
nominal roll and W. M. Hughes has
written a foreword.
Drum Madness, by The Edingtons and
Marianne Barrett (Cassell; Dymock’s ;
7s. 6d.), is a thriller with Tahiti as its
venue, and a lot of writing like this:
Soft, scented air. Hot, enervating days.
Moon-flooded nights.
Blazing, life-giving sun. Torrential, death-
dealing rain.
Blinding light. Dense, sinister shadow.
The loss of the Bora-Bora pearl causes
all the trouble. In the end the heroine
takes strong measures:
Before Ariitea could drag herself to
her feet the lash descended.
Once ! Twice ! Three times !
Streamers of red sprang out about the
golden body.
Under these ministrations the owner of
the body produces the pearl and the
yarn ends. Not bad as a story, but the
affectations do their best to spoil it.
Love and Forget, by James Wedg-
wood Drawbell (Collins ; 7s. 6d.), is the
title of the first, and best, of the 18
stories in this volume. Like the others
it is sentimental; the hero is going blind,
but the American married woman who
meets him on a pleasure cruise in the
Mediterranean and wants to exchange
him for her husband doesn’t know it.
He resists for her own good. A feature
of all the yarns is the dialogue, which is
singularly alive. Also most of the end-
ings are smart in the manner of the late
lamented O. Henry.
Broken Music, by Morna Mactaggart
(Nicholson and Watson ; Bs. 6d.). The
charm of this story of a pre-war girl
who marries a German lies in the tense
writing, in the observation of character
—and particularly of German character
—and in the suave tolerance of the
writer in all circumstances. Emily’s life
in Germany with Kurt and her children
has its sorrows ; but there are compen-
sations. It ends with the marriage of
Emily’s children. She is back in Ger-
many again.
She had lived without Kurt and with-
out children, then she had lived with them,
and now she must learn to live without
them again. But an old woman had been
left to her, who happened to be two
things—the best friend she had had, and
in need of her.
It will never make a movie, being
studiously adramatic, but it is very like
life.
Monsters and Powers of Darkness, at
2s. 6d. each, are welcome additions to
Philip Allan’s celebrated “Creeps” series.
Lord Dunsany and Cicely Fox Smith,
the writer of sea stories, are among the
contributors to the second anthology of
marrow-freezers.
Twelve Jews, edited by Hector Bolitho
(Rich and Cowan; Rawson’s, Melb.;
155.). Eleven of them are Epstein,
Ehrlich, Freud, Mond, Proust, Rathenau,
Disraeli, Reinhardt, Trotsky, Luzzatti
and Weizmann. The only financial genius
is Lord Bearsted —which tends to con-
tradict the opinion held in some quar-
ters that if all the Jews were massacred
the world would automatically recover
from its economic difficulties. If Jews
are pre-eminently acquisitive, what are
Freud, Trotsky, Proust, Ehrlich, Rein-
hardt and Epstein doing in this galley?
The fact is the so-called acquisitive in-
stinct is merely the will to power, and it
can take the form of a conquest over
the problems of art or of science just as
well as over business rivals. Philip Lind-
say’s chapter on Freud is disappointing ;
he has obviously only a journalist’s
qualifications for dealing with one of the
most significant figures of the century.
Australia’s Backyards, by R. H. Mil-
ford (The Macquarie Head Press;
7s. 6d.). If an Englishman had been
guilty of this sustained diatribe against
everything Australian, from Darwin
round by Wyndham and Broome to
Perth and thence back to Darwin via
every important centre in the Common-
wealth, Mr. Milford would be the first to
bellow with fury. Bellow is the word.
He lives in a seething passion of moral
indignation. To read him is like listen-
ing to a senior member of a London
service club talking about Communism.
He was in Adelaide when what he calls
“the maniacal bodyline bowling” was
being exploited.
If anyone expressed to me their opinions
of ‘ this form of savagery they were told
that the only way to stop it was—retalia-
tion, and that it would be effective to
bowl straight at the centre of the English-
men’s foreheads.
“The Adulteresses of Darwin” is the
heading of his first chapter, and
“Through the Modern Gomorras” intro-
duces Adelaide and the large coastal
cities. There are maps which show his
wanderings, and some interesting photo-
graphs.

ON A WONDERFUL WICKET.
Mr. Collier arrived in Melbourne for
the Loan Council meetings with the re-
port that his Government would not be
able to keep its deficit down to the
agreed-upon figure, £750,000, and that
the Commonwealth Bank would have to
carry it to the extent of another £40,000.
A friendly newspaper had preceded him
with the assertion that “it is impossible
to balance the State Budget owing to ex-
cessive Federal taxation.”
Federal taxation is excessive in the
sense that the Lyons Government is get-
ting more revenue than is necessary for
the functions it performs. The proposed
distribution among the States of
£2,000,000 of its surplus proves that. But
the sufferings of Westralia are not con-
spicuous, though its Government is
always pleading a poor mouth. It is the
taxpayers of N. S. Wales and Victoria
who have most right to grumble. Mainly
out of the revenue they provide Westralia
received a special payment of £600,000
last year, which was more than half of
the total (£1,128,500) it collected in State
taxes. The £600,000 was additional to a
Commonwealth contribution of £473,400
towards State interest and sinking fund,
and to Westralia’s large share of the
£2,000,000 handed out for Federal-aid
roads. In short, the Collier Government
received more in grants from the Com-
monwealth than it raised in taxes.
The Victorians anticipate a deficit of
£920,000. It would be embarrassing if
they demanded compensation on the same
scale and threatened to secede if they
didn’t get it.
On one industry which has escaped the
depression Federal taxation is a trifle
light as air. Just before Mr. Collier left
Perth it was announced that Westralian
gold production for five months to the
end of May was valued at £2,164,870
Australian, of which the premium
accounted for £1,064,562. It was an-
nounced also that 10s. shares in the
Sons of Gwalia had advanced in London
from 13s. in June, 1932, to 545. and
that dividends and bonuses were expected
to go to ss. a share p.a. And in Mel-
bourne Mr. Collier learned that Wiluna’s
monthly surplus had gone up from
£52,000 to £54,000. To both these British
companies the State Government lent
money (it lent the Sons of Gwalia
£40,000 free of interest), and its loan to
Wiiuna was guaranteed by the Com-
monwealth.
Commonwealth tax on the dividends
paid by these companies and others
which are doing so famously is Is. in
the £. State imposts are Is. 3d. in the
£, plus 15 p.c. super-tax, l|d. in the £
for hospitals, and 9d. in the £ emergency
tax —for three months of the present
financial year emergency tax was sus-
pended. State duty on all company divi-
dends last year realised £168,600 —just a
little more than Wiluna’s quarterly
surplus.
Every week or so a stout and amiable
mining investor arrives in Perth from
Britain. In his own country he is accus-
tomed to pay income tax at a flat rate
of ss. in the £ and a surtax on £2OOO and
upwards—on an income of £20,000 sur-
tax alone has been £4681. The affable
gentleman invariably pays his respects to
the Government, and is generally en-
tertained at a dinner where compliments
are exchanged. At the latest of these
functions the Labor Minister of Mines
assured the wanderer and British in-
vestors in general (“goldbugs” and
“guinea-pigs” in other days) that they
had nothing to fear from his Govern-
ment. On no account would it follow
Canada in demanding 10 per cent, of the
value of gold won, or imitate Maoriland
(that country charges an export duty of
15s. a fine ounce), much less copy Hert-
zog and Smuts. Those hidebound Dutch
Tories took 52 p.c. of the profits of 17
gold-mining companies operating in their
country last year—£lo,22s.ooo out of
£19,516,000.
Gold at £8 10s. a fine ounce —a price
which admits of 4dwt. stone being worked
at a profit—and Commonwealth tax only
Is. in the £1 of dividends! And from
the Government which collects it the
State which produces nearly all the gold
is getting more than it raises in tax-
revenue and is demanding another half-
million! It would be a frightful thing
for the taxpayers of Westralia and the
shareholders in Westralian goldmines if
the rest of Australia let the secessionists
have their way.
A DEFENCE DEPARTMENT ON
THE DEFENCE.
“No surprise would be caused in well-
informed quarters if the Ministry announced
its intention of arranging for a visit to Aus-
tralia of a high military authority from Britain
to advise upon a policy for the development
of the Defence services.”
If this inspired item were genuine it
would represent one of the most shock-
ing confessions of ineptitude that a
modern Government has made. The
Commonwealth has spent a fortune ac-
quiring policies for the development of
its defence services:
Kitchener Report (1910).
Henderson Report (1911).
Report of Royal Commission on Navy
and Defence Administration (1918).
Jellicoe Report (1919).
Salmond Report (1928).
About a year ago W. M. Hughes organ-
ised the Defence of Australia League,
and it promptly evoked the Pearce
Report (1933). This report foreshadowed
“a squadron of four effective cruisers
in full commission, with requisite air-
craft, a destroyer leader and four.
destroyers in full commission,” together
with “sloops for use as minesweepers in
war-time,” all necessary bases and
equipment and “a trained personnel to
maintain the efficiency and mobility of
the squadron.”
As regards the army,
Much is required to be done to place
things on a satisfactory basis. The Gov-
ernment considers that no further time
should be allowed to pass without taking
steps to rectify matters.
The present position is that the R.A.N.,
which in 1919 numbered 28 vessels in
full commission, is now down to two
cruisers and four destroyers in com-
mission, plus some ships tied up to buoys
and looked after by caretakers. The
army, for its part, could not muster
enough officers and men in any city of
the Commonwealth to deal with a riot.
It has been revealed that barely 20 sol-
diers would have been available had the
Westralian Government solicited Com-
monwealth help during the anti-foreign
outbreaks on the goldfields.
Since the end of 1914 the Common-
wealth has been through a war in which
Australian officers and men, ranks and
ratings, covered themselves with glory.
A number of senior officers emerged
who were equal to the world’s best, and
many are still alive. Lieut.-General
White, for example, who was recognised
by the end of 1918 as probably the most
efficient staff officer on the Western
Front. And the Defence Department
now says there is not one man in the
Commonwealth capable of advising the
Government on Australian defence!
The only shadow of an excuse for
importing an adviser is that there have
been advances in mechanised warfare
during the past 15 years. But for the
past 15 years the Government has been
sending army, air-force and naval officers
to England to do advanced war courses.
Even assuming that such a man as Lieut.-
General White has allowed himself to
get behindhand as regards mechanisation
(and nothing is less likely), there is thus
an army of staff officers available to put
their recently-acquired knowledge at his
disposal. And the Lieut.-General, and
others whose names will occur to any
student of defence, have one of the most
valuable of all assets from the standpoint
of advisers on local defence —knowledge
of local conditions.
But it is improbable that the Govern-
ment has any intention of importing “a
high military authority from Britain.”
The Salmond Report on the state of our
air defences was so devastating that no
one wishes to court another like it. The
newspaper communique is simply a her-
ring drawn across the menacing Alan
Casey track.
“ECONOMIC NATIONALISM.”
It is the fashion to call it that now, and
to hold it responsible for all the ills that
have come upon the country. But it
may not be a bad thing for us when
the confused world has sorted itself out.
After all, Britain was the mother of
economic nationalism. It was under a
system of Protection which considered the
heeds of Britons first and all the lime that
Britain became the wealthiest country in
the world. Under Freetrade, its progress
was not nearly so great as that of other
countries during a like period under Pro-
tection, which has been specially kind to
the U.S.A. and to Australia —though in
Australia it has been misused by political
spendthrifts who regard the tariff as a
revenue-producing instrument rather
than as a means of fostering Australian
industry.
Some people point to the U.S.A. finan-
cial disaster as a practical anti-tariff
lecture. But the troubles of the Ameri-
cans have come mostly from an improper
use of Protection. Its benefits were such
that they piled up more wealth than has
ever been seen in a single country, and
gambled with it in a manner which would
have made the degenerate Roman Empire
blush. The extent of this gambling may
be gauged from the figures of the U.S.A.
Senate’s Banking and Currency Committee,
which announced a few weeks ago that
the net income of 437 New York Stock
Exchange members in 1928, at the peak
of the boom, was £69,000,000 sterling,
and their gross income nearly
£140,000,000. In 1929, 1,124,608,910
shares were turned over in the mad
paper race for wealth.
Australia, like other countries, can never
be self-contained, but it should be more
self-reliant than it is. The thought of what
would happen if a hostile nation cut off
our oil-fuel, transport-vehicle and textile
supplies is enough to make a sensible man
shiver. And our fuels mainly come from
countries which buy little from us. What
we cannot make should be the subject of
quid pro quo agreements —“you buy
from me and I buy from you.” But such
bargains should always be driven with
the knowledge that a home market of
fully-employed workers is the best and
safest, and that the most difficult and
burdensome drain on resources which
we have to meet are external interest
payments.
In the decade between 1919 and 1929,
as C. V. Potts, president of the N.S.W.
Chamber of Manufactures, has pointed
out, factory employees in the Common-
wealth increased from 340,000 to 452,000,
say 30 p.c. The wages paid in the manu-
facturing industries when the depression
struck us were £90,000,000 p.a. against
£42,000,000 in 1919; and £80,000,000,
50 p.c. more, was being put into raw
materials than ten years previously.
This is the sort of development that
needs to be encouraged. If there were a
population here big enough to consume
half the land produce which now has to
be exported, much of it to be worked up
in overseas factories, there would be little
talk of depression or fear for the future.
There is plenty of money available for
expansion—the banks have huge deposits
which they are prepared to lend for in-
dustrial development. How easily this
money can be freed is shown every time
a Government loan is raised. Allocations
these days always have to be rationed.
It would be much better if some of this
cash could be put into industry which
would give permanent work, instead of
into relief schemes. That it is not in
demand for that purpose shows that there
is something radically wrong with con-
ditions of investment. Taxation is too
heavy, and there are too many tax-
gatherers ; political and industrial con-
ditions are insecure. Investors have no
incentive to assist industrial expansion
while seven Treasuries tax profits and
some tax the tax-money paid to others,
and while lawyers and politicians meddle
in the arrangements of employers and
employees.
More commonsense and good feeling
are needed to bring Australia to a condi-
tion of reasonable self-dependence. It
can only be done by the application of
the doctrine of a fair thing all round—
fair prices for raw materials, fair wages
for a fair day’s work and a fair deal for
industry from Governments.
CHAIN STORES.
IThe Bulletin’s articles on this subject have
started a flood of contributions which would
spread over several pages if they were all
printed. Room is found for two, giving the
case for and against. The first is from Vic-
toria; the second from N. S. Wales.]
FOR.
Where are those returned-soldier toy-
makers (B. 6/6/’34)? In Victoria the
chains are putting them into business.
My sympathy goes out to the poor
soldier’s widow and daughter ; but chains
always buy direct from the manufacturer
(this is held to be another crime they
commit). Perhaps the R.S.S.I.L.A will
claim a pension for the widow.
Chain stores have never yet shown
how much they have appreciated the
value of goods, but I will pick one line.
The standard tin of talc powder was Is.
or Is. 3d. a few years ago. To-day an
excellent tin of talc can be bought for
6d. The chains place such huge quanti-
ties in one order that it is economically
safe for a manufacturer to make the line.
I know of chains that buy dies and
tools for their suppliers.
A Canadian report is mentioned. I
will wager that worse conditions could
be found in any small store in the metro-
politan area where a family is employed.
It is almost impossible for the inspectors
to check them up, and father or uncle
pays what he pleases.
Chain stores are subject to inspection
any minute, and I cannot call to mind
any of them being fined, although I am
sure it would have received excellent
publicity. I have before me the wages
scale of one of the largest variety chains.
It employs no one under the age of 16.
Girls commence with 16s. 6d. a week in
N. S. Wales and Is. more in Victoria.
As for the large percentage of girls to
men, some allowance must be made for
male supervision. Would you like to be
served with a shaving-stick or a cake of
soap by an able-bodied man who would
be better employed in developing the
country?
Labor is backing the chains for two
reasons: (1) They set a high standard of
treatment to employees. (2) They supply
good articles at a reasonable price.
The chains in Australia to a large
extent take the place of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society of Great Britain, whose
direct sales, irrespective of its fac-
tories and banking, exceed £100,000,000
p.a. Labor, as always, will not be down-
trodden and forced to pay fictitious
prices for goods produced and distri-
buted inefficiently.
It is correct that the U.S.A. has en-
deavored to grapple with the problem
and failed. Trying to make water run
uphill is a difficult and expensive job.
Tock-Tock.
AGAINST.
By selling only stock lines and sizes
chain stores ensure a quick turnover.
They are content to leave odd sizes and
lines to the ordinary retailer, who must,
therefore, carry a large stock to ensure
even a small turnover. Chain stores em-
ploy their huge capital to obtain reduc-
tions in cost price for large-quantity pur-
chases. They then cut the price to the
public, and the public patronises them,
not bothering about the annihilation of the
retail trader. But it ought to bother
about it.
It is not in the interest of any country
that honest, hard-working traders should
be ruined. They are a useful section
everywhere, and in many parts of Aus-
tralia the storekeeper has been as truly
a pioneer as the farmer and grazier.
Obviously, the amount of business done
by a chain store greatly exceeds that of
a retail store. Thus, when a chain store
opens in a district it will eventually
cause two retail stores to close. Then
the property-owner suffers; no keen
businessman will open up in proximity
to a chain store. And with the retail
trader goes the commercial traveller,
since the ’chain buys direct from the
factory.
And by employing girls and women in
place of men chain stores increase the
number of adult unemployed. The girls
have no really intelligent work to do —
they merely wrap up the parcel and hand
back the change. This results in bore-
dom on the part of the salesgirl. There
is no friendly human contact between
seller and buyer—a definite, though in-
tangible, loss.
In Britain companies controlling more
than a certain number of stores are
taxed for each further store they open.
In America several States have refused
to allow chain stores to open within their
boundaries.
UNDERGRAD.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
These Be Our Leaders!
The Loan Council’s show in Melbourne
was a repetition of previous perform-
ances, except that there were more bluff
and humbug.
The Prime Minister opened it with
a turn in which he offered to let the
State Governments have £2,000,000 out
of his Government’s accumulated surplus
of thrice that amount. He did not say
that a distribution of functions that
admits of a central Government which
is anything but economical having so
huge a surplus while provincial Govern-
ments, no more extravagant, have annual
deficits is all wrong and should be radi-
cally altered. And no one pointed out
that it is utterly rotten finance for one
authority to raise money by taxation and
hand it over to others to spend. No
one was thinking of reform.
Mr. Lyons explained that no string
would be tied to the gift. His Govern-
ment, however, yearned to do some-
thing for unemployed youths, and hoped
that as much as possible would be spent
in a “vigorous effort” to help them.
Some of the gentlemen present thought
of the promises they had made to public-
service organisations. All refrained from
committing themselves.
The States’ deficits were discussed. The
Commonwealth Bank had been assured
that the 1933-34 litter would not exceed
£8,340,000, but a bit more was asked for
to accommodate Victoria and Westralia.
It was admitted, nevertheless, that the
actual total might be £850,000 less. Con-
cerning the deficits for 1934-35, it was
suggested that the Commonwealth Bank
should back them to the extent of
£7,200,000, although, thanks to the loan
conversions and sinking-fund opera-
tions, the six Governments will have
£1,600,000 less to pay.
At this stage a cold wind began blow-
ing from the direction of the bank. The
Prime Minister seized the opportunity to
scurry away to Tasmania, Earle Page
and party having booked passages for
Launceston and a party squabble being
more important than the nation’s busi-
ness.
The Prime Minister did not come back.
In his absence, the Premiers, after exhi-
bitions of temper, said they would
reduce their deficits to a total of
£5,880,000, and the Commonwealth
Bank Board agreed to discount Treasury
bills to that extent, subject to an equiva-
lent amount being funded. It dryly
added that it would give no undertaking
for the subsequent year.
Then loan programmes for works were
produced. It was decided to go on the
market for £11,600,000, plus £11,000,000
in hand. Reduction of taxes, conditional
on employment being given, is an alter-
native to borrowing for “works,” which
has failed in boom times and bad times
alike, but it wasn’t even mentioned.
Neither was the other alternative of Gov-
ernment loans to concerns capable of
expansion, after the model of the advance
to the returned soldiers’ woollen mill at
Geelong.
How destitute of leadership this nation
is! How barren of ideas are its seven
Governments, whether they call them-
selves U.A.P. or Labor!
, »
Future of the Wine Trade.
The vice-president of a big Australian
wine concern arrived back from the
U.S.A. last week with cheering news.
French wines are out. Australian wines,
particularly sparkling wines, are being
accepted by the American people in prefer-
ence to any other.
Thirty-odd years ago, when J. F. Archi-
bald laid down his first cellar of S. Aus-
tralian chablis and burgundy, The Bul-
letin prophesied that the wine industry
—then extremely unfashionable—had a
future as great as that of the wool indus-
try itself. The climate and country requi-
site for the production of high-class wines
are even rarer than merino-sheep coun-
try ; and in a world which has just been
given a demonstration of the perils of
prohibition there should shortly be a
great market for our sound wines. For
.over quarter of a century methods of
production have been improving, and a
stage has been reached where many of
our beverage wines can challenge com-
parison with all but the classic vintage
products of Europe.
This is an industry in which there
should be no necessity for mark-time
agreements for generations to come.
Provided we send the best in every class,
and nothing but the best, the non-wine-
producing countries will take all our
vignerons have to sell. The chief require-
ment is for Governments to leave the
industry alone. Federal Governments
should confine themselves to seeing that
no wine leaves the country which is likely
to give the trade a bad advertisement
overseas, and State Governments to see-
ing that bad wine isn’t retailed locally.
The strongest argument for prohibition
here has always been the factor which
did most to make it a byword in
America—liquor which was cheap and
deadly because it was unmatured.
If our State Governments wanted to
serve the cause of real temperance they
would first make the selling of poison in
the guise of wine an indictable offence,
and then legislate to make sound wine
as easy to buy as it is jn wine-drinking
Continental countries, which provide les-
sons in temperance to most white British
communities.
♦
The “Right” to Secede.
Boulder City councillors have followed
their Kalgoorlie brethren in declaring that
if Swanland breaks away the goldfields
will remain in the union; and both
national-minded municipal bodies are
being roundly abused by the Perth seces-
sionists, who have a gift that way. Still,
if Swanland is entitled to secede, though
the electors of Westralia (44,800 against
19,691) “agreed to unite” with the people
of their sister-States “in one indissoluble
Federal Commonwealth under the Crown
and under the Constitution,” it cannot
logically object to the goldfields and the
north-west and the far north seceding
from Swanland. If there is any validity
in the “principle” these separatists in-
voke, it may surely be invoked against
them.
Nevertheless, the goldfields, should
they ever. be called upon to make a
choice, will be in a position to rest their
case on solider grounds than the “right”
to secede. As a part of the Common-
wealth they are clearly entitled to
remain within it. The loyal Virginians
had the same right when secessionists
overran most of their State, and the loyal
Virginians exercised it.

A Jury Disagrees.
On the dark evening of May 10, Mon-
crieff Anderson, an invalid pensioner
camped in a “hovel in miserable sur-
roundings,” met a violent death. Years
ago his skull had been fractured, and
the injury “sometimes affected his
head and ears.” He was at the
Wagga municipal water trough with his
23-year-old wife. Bystanders, hearing a
noise and shrieks from Mrs, Anderson
of “Crieff is shot! Crieff is murdered!”
found him with a bullet through his head.
Mrs. Anderson said she had seen a
“pink flash”—nothing more. She asked
the police whether they had found £5
on the body ; then she said “They robbed
him as well.” Later, according to the
police, she admitted voluntarily that she
had lied when she said that she and her
husband had disposed of a rifle found
in the trough. She had, she declared,
taken it on her husband’s request to
shoot cats;
If I shot him it must have been an
accident. I think the gun got caught in
my coat.
The £5, the police said, was in her
possession.
All this was brought out in evidence at
the trial of the woman for murder, to-
gether with her admission that she had
written passionate letters under a false
name to and about Edward Morey, con-
victed of the murder of one Smith, at
whose trial her husband had been a
Crown witness. Morey was called as a
witness in the woman’s case. He said
he had never seen her before the sight
of her in the dock.
Two doctors declared that accused was
not insane, but mentally retarded, with
the intelligence of a girl of 14. She had
married at 14, a sister declared, and had
a baby a few months later. From the
dock, in an unsworn statement, she told
a new story —that her husband, return-
ing from an absence with bloodstained
garments, had confessed to the murder
of a man (presumably Smith) with whom
he had quarrelled, and threatened to
kill her if she told the police;
that Anderson had prompted the writ-
ing of her letters, and importuned
her to help convict Morey ; that on the
night of the tragedy her husband smacked
her across the face (“He had been drink-
ing heavily”), and that at the well “she
heard a click and saw a rifle.”
I grabbed it and I don’t know what
happened next.
She said that her previous untruthful-
ness was due to the police frightening
her.
The jury, after being , locked up all
night, could not come to a decision.
Said Halse Rogers, J.: “It is unfortunate
that a trial of this nature should end in
a disagreement of the jury.” There is
to be another trial, and meantime Morey
is appealing.

“Germania, Unlimited.”
The president of the Reichsbank is the
latest to demand the return of the Ger-
man colonies. He says it is the only solu-
tion of the transfer problem which has
prompted Germany to declare a “mora-
torium” in respect of foreign-loan pay-
ments ; meantime, if Britain retaliates,
Germany will break off all intercourse
with the British Commonwealth of
Nations. “Tacitus,” replying to “Feng-
Shui” (B. 13/6/’34), advances other argu-
ments why the colonies should be re-
turned. They will not convince Austra-
lians ; neither will the threats of Dr.
Schlact:—
Every student of geography knows that all
countries in the moderate zone of the Southern
Hemisphere suitable for colonisation by white
people were acquired by a few European
nations long before the German Empire came
into existence in 1871.
It is true that Bismarck was originally
opposed to the acquisition of colonies. Not
because he did not recognise their importance
to the Fatherland, but because he desired
above all other things to consolidate the power
of the newly-created Empire and, therefore,
desired no overseas entanglements. In the
early ’eighties, however, he supported a
colonial policy and sanctioned the acquisi-
tion of colonies in Africa and the South Seas.
Unfortunately for Germany the only countries
still unclaimed by European Powers were in
the tropics. Some of these were obtained by
treaty or purchase—not by conquest. South-
West Africa, the only country in the sub-
tropics—a sand-box not desired by Briton or
Boer of that period—proved to be unsuitable
for European settlement to any large extent.
Except Samoa, all the colonies acquired in
the ’eighties were undeveloped, largely fever-
stricken and with no trade to speak of. The
task devolved upon the German nation to open
up these countries with harbors, roads and
railways, to bring the land under suitable cul-
tivation and the native population under good
government. This latter led to trouble such as
the Herero War in South-West Africa, but other
nations have experienced the same difficulty.
One need only instance the Zulu and Ashanti
wars and the French wars in Morocco and
Dahomey.
But the colonies progressed under German
administration, as has been shown by such a
British Empire-builder as Sir Henry John-
stone. Togo and Samoa were self-
supporting in 1914, New Guinea almost self-
supporting, and several others on the high-
road to prosperity and on the way to supply
Germany with a large part of her requirements
in tropical products. “Feng-Shui” mentions
2 p.c. as the colonies’ total share of Ger-
many’s huge foreign trade in 1914. Really a
good proof of their ultimate importance in
Germany’s economic system.
As for the statement that only 25,592 Ger-
mans were settled in German colonies prior
to the war, how many British settlers were in
adjacent British colonies, how many French
in adjacent French colonies, and how many
Belgians in Belgian territories? Most of the
nationals of those countries likewise prefer
temperate climates for permanent settlement.
German emigrants had to renounce their pre-
ference and become good settlers in foreign
countries.
“Feng-Shui” further asserts that the painful
loss of its colonies has only just been brought
before the German public by Nazi propagan-
dists, but in this he is mistaken. The German
Colonial Society and its president, Dr. Schnee,
a former Governor of German East Africa,
have never ceased to keep this subject promi-
nently before the people. Virile races need
colonies, and Germany needs them just as
much as any other nation; far-seeing states-
men recognise the justice of her claims to her
colonies as being the best sphere into which to
direct German energy and activities.
Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles,
the German colonies had to be transferred to
the League of Nations and the latter appointed
mandatories temporarily to administer its trust.
As some mandatories already have large terri-
tories of their own which they are unable to
populate, the day may come when they may
consider it a fortunate circumstance to be able
to relinquish their task and to be relieved of
what to them, at best, can only be a heavy re-
sponsibility and a costly encumbrance.

Mussolini’s Way.
Australians wouldn’t care to be ruled
by a Mussolini, but the Duce certainly
does things. Ruling a poor country
about a third larger than Victoria, into
which 41,000,000 people are packed, he
goes vigorously ahead with industrial and
land-settlement policies. In five years
he has moved nearly one-sixth of the
Italian workers from their home districts
to where they can find jobs. Although
his debts are great and his trade balance
always on the wrong side, his imports
of raw materials grow.
His land-settlement plans are striking.
While Australian politicians look gloom-
ily on land prospects and think about
restriction, Mussolini has put 40,000
people on reclaimed areas alone between
June, 1930, and December, 1933, while
in the maintenance of main roads
1870 families have been provided for per-
manently. A recent Naples subdivision
has given the country another 1400
farmers.
The leader of the Italians intends to
do more in the next five years. He seems
to have the solid backing of the workers.
They probably like him better because
his public-works expedients run more to
civic beautification, rural improvement
and the establishment of key-manufac-
turing plants than to the shifting of sand
and the construction of cement sewers
which appeal to the imaginations of Aus-
tralia’s Stevenses and Argyles.
♦
Stevens and Small Beer.
Things like the chain-store menace, the
extraction of a fifth and utterly immoral
tax from people drawing income from
other States and even the impudent de-
fiance of its own regulations by lottery-
promoters leave the Stevens Government
unmoved. But when the Stuart Doyle
concern, whose moving-picture palaces
dot the Sydney landscape, found itself
threatened with competition in the build-
ing line, the Government sprang to at-
tention. It straightway appointed an
accountant to advise it whether it should
forbid such competition, and told him that
if he had any difficulty in getting evi-
dence he could be given the powers of
a Royal Commissioner.
Mr. Marks, the accountant, had no
difficulty in getting evidence. None what-
ever. Eighteen counsel, 39 organisations
and 84 witnesses poured it out for him.
The Chief Secretary detached his own
private secretary to supervise the pro-
ceedings, and Mr. Marks required 6000
words to name and thank the Govern-
ment which appointed him and the
people who rushed to give unsworn tes-
timony. Apart from open-court sit-
tings, there were unreported meetings,
at which “material information of a
most confidential nature was readily sup-
plied,” and a museum of 414 exhibits,
including newspaper cuttings and Acts of
the State of New Mexico —it takes ten
foolscap pages to contain the catalogue.
At the end of 54 sittings, Mr. Marks
was able to “approach my recommenda-
tion with a full recognition of the im-
portance of the issues involved.” A mere
40,000 words now printed at public cost
suffice for him to explain that “the in-
troduction of legislation to restrict the
licensing of additional picture theatres in
Sydney is not required.”
There are 15 men in the Stevens
Ministry, several of them accountants.
If they cannot arrive at decisions on
matters like this without calling in
accountants from outside, it is a poor com-
pliment to their industry and their ability
to govern. It may be that Mr. Stevens’s
soft heart inclines him to be charitable
towards the poor moving-picture poten-
tate ; but there are far more deserving
objects. Business people in the vicinity
of Circular Quay, who have been half-
ruined by the diversion of the harbor
traffic over a ten-million-pound bridge,
could well do with a little practical sym-
pathy. So could the people who are pay-
ing taxes to meet the losses on the bridge.
They are being saddled with another cool
£700,000 to house hundreds of public
servants, some of whom should surely
be capable of giving the Government
simple advice on simple questions, should
it need such advice.
♦
The Falling Birth-rate.
The Australian birth-rate is still falling.
Natural increase of population for the
first quarter of 1933 was 14,937 ; for the
first quarter of 1934 it was 13,153. Rates
of natural increase were 15.04 per thou-
sand in 1921 ; 7.9 in 1933.
Even the increase which does take
place does not depend entirely upon the
incidence of births. Since 1901 there has
been a 57 p.c. improvement in the sur-
vival rate of those over three-score years
and a 54.2 improvement in the over-50
quota.
The decline in births is most notice-
able in States with blqated cities and bad
unemployment figures. Queensland, where
there is a better balance between city
and country, and (perhaps as a result) the
smallest proportion of unemployed, shows
the only State improvement in March*
quarter birth statistics.
The position is well illustrated by N.
S. Wales developments in the past six
years. In 1928 Sydney had 1,066,000
people against 1,417,000 in the rest of
the State. During the six years from
Jan., 1928, to Dec., 1933, there were
296,410 births; 176,310 were in the
country and 120,100 in the metropolis.
Yet the population of the country has
declined to 1,378,000, while that of the
Huge Wen has increased to 1,235,000.
Every batch of immigrants from the
country to Sydney suburbs makes things
worse. In 1928 the metropolitan birth-
rate per 1000 was only 1.87 less than that
of the whole State on an average. Now.
it is 3.05 less, and Sydney’s 1,200,000
people are producing only 17,000 young-
sters a year against the 27,000 produced
by the 1,400,000 in the country.
If present trends continue, Australia.
Queensland possibly excepted, will
become more and more a land of old
people, which is a bad thing in a new
country.


SOCIETY
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“X.S.”: Second thoughts are not
always best in the view of the Fitzroy
(Vic.) police. In that lively suburb it
is not uncommon for a woman to give
her husband in charge for assault and
then withdraw the case as soon as she
gets in the witness-box. One dame, a
constable protested, had done it four
times in recent months, and it brought the
force into contempt. The P.M. expressed
sympathy with the police, and even tried
to induce the lady to repent of her for-
giveness, but it was no use. “We. were
both as bad as each other,” she confessed.
"No good, ole man; it’s sish o’clock. Can’t y’ shee?”
“We both did things on the spur of the
moment, and I gave him in charge on the
spur of the moment, too.” Case with-
drawn.
“Ibn el Issar”: The cables are exer-
cised over the fact that in Southern
India, where the Hindu faiths are prac-
tically unassailed, general sacrifice of
animals is in progress, designed to stay
the progress of Silala, the inflictor of
small-pox. The streets of some of the
towns are described as reeking with
blood from the cut throats of the ani-
mals. Yet the writer is game to swear
that 90 per cent, of the folk who have
given themselves up to this welter of
slaughter are vaccinated persons who
have imbibed a fair amount of education
from the rule of the Sirkar and yet go
back to the old gods when mass terror
breaks out. It is an old habit, by no
means confined to India. The beliefs
and superstitions of a hundred thousand
years inevitably prevail with a primitive
people, no matter how much modernity
has done to brush them aside.
* * * *
“Green Park”: The cabled news that
Lady Haig has been granted a suite of
apartments at Hampton Court Palace
calls attention to a pleasant English cus-
tom. The country is dotted with alms-
houses for the lowly poor, founded in
the long ago by private individuals. For
the more exalted folk there is provision
not only at Hampton Court, but at Wind-
sor, St. James’s Palace and Kensington
Palace. The accommodation is free,
though tenants have to furnish their
rooms themselves; in addition to the
housing they have the use of the gar-
dens and grounds. Most, of those bene-
fiting are soldiers of some distinction or,
as in Lady Haig’s case, their widows or
immediate relatives.
* * * *
“W.L.”: Old mariners who know the
Coral Sea will find it hard to swallow the
story that an obscure French navigator
has found a new island up there. Every
part of the sea, which is only about
100 miles in width, has been crossed and
recrossed by pearlers and their tenders.
The reported position of the new island
is given as 50 miles north-west of Booby
Island light and within 50 miles of the
Papuan coast, which would make it right
on top of the Cook Reef and close to
Proudfoot Shoal, where there is a light-
ship. It seems very doubtful that an
island six miles long, with palm-trees on
it. has waited all these years to be dis-
covered by an itinerant sailor in a junk
which, at latest reports, was being towed
into Thursday Island, having capped the
discovery of an island with that of a
reef. The crews of the Moresby,
Geranium and other navy survey ships
will be interested to hear what they have
missed in the Coral Sea.
“Hamer”: Clocks have a queer hold
upon human imagination ; you soon come
to look on them as old friends. It may
be this curious characteristic that filled
me with satisfaction when I saw that the
old clock of the Balfour Hotel is to be
reinstalled in the new building in Eliza-
beth-street. For 40 years that timepiece
has been a landmark ; it arrived when
Elizabeth-street was an almost near-
suburban thoroughfare, lined with board-
ing-houses, and it seems a part of Sydney.
Amongst other things, I can remember
casting many a nervous glance at it as
a schoolboy, wondering if I was late for
a pantomime, consulting it in my youth
when bound for love-trysts, and regularly
checking my own timepiece by it in later
years. I suppose that thousands of Syd-
neyites share the same queer feelings
about our old friend.
* * *
“General Prac.": A Ceylon murderer,
it is cabled, hit on an unusual means of
slaying his spouse ; he chloroformed her
as she slept. I can find only one case re-
motely like it in criminal records, that of
a French girl who poured chloroform
down her husband’s throat while he was
having forty winks. We read in novels
and see on the films a good deal of bunk
about anaesthetics —“the handkerchief
was pressed over her nostrils, and she
knew no more.” Without the aid of a
“What made you buy it, Joe?”
“Well, it’ll be a novelty to have something in the house the wife can’t chuck
at me.”
gang of bruisers no anaesthetist could put
a healthy woman to sleep against her
will, but there have been many cases of
suicide with the stuff, either by inhala-
tion or swallowing, and quite a few
doctors have sad reasons for hating its
very name. Well handled, it is a good
amesthetic, and its portability must have
made it a godsend to country doctors in
the old days. But I doubt whether any
of us would grieve to see it go for good.
Strangely enough, child-bearing women
lap it up without harm in the most amaz-
ing way.
“Hamer”: The sale of Wigram
House at the corner of Castle-
reagh-street and Hosking-place,
Sydney, for £52,000 stirs some
memories. On the site was the first
regular home of the Athenaeum
Club, a Bohemian institution until
it was amalgamated with the Im-
perial Service. Less than 30 years
ago it was the jumping-off spot for
Sydney’s last duel, arranged be-
tween a journalist and a Pole. A
line of cabs like a funeral proces-
sion went out to the ponds at Cen-
tennial Park, and came back again
for pies and coffee, after the prin-
cipals had exchanged shots and the
seconds had decided that honor
was satisfied. Neither of the duel-
lists knew that there were no bul-
lets in their weapons. Hosking-
place is itself historic. It once had
a terrace of houses on each side
and was Sydney’s theatrical street.
The Stewarts’ Sydney home was in
one of the houses ; here Nellie, as
an infant, played on the doorstep
with her dolls. Next door Walter Baker
was born.
“L. 1.8.”: A floating mine, a derelict
of the war, blew up some mili-
tary cadets in Europe the other
day when hauled ashore. The Ist L.H.
had a similar experience when El
Arish was occupied by the Anzac M.D.
The squadron I was with was the left-
flanker and first into the town ; the re-
mainder of the brigade was on the other
side of the wadi, with the rest of the divi-
sion following up. There had been no
opposition, and our squadron-leader had
sent a patrol down to the beach to nose
round. Suddenly there was a tremen-
dous explosion, and the sergeant in com-
mand of the patrol was blown to bits.
The version 1 got was that a mine laid
by the submarines which were always
trying to trap our monitors had drifted
ashore, and the victim had been foolish
enough to do something with one of the
triggers.

“Overprint”: The assertion by postal
serang Brown that a black stamp he
is issuing will be “unique” (B. 20/6/ 34'
by reason of its color moves me to de-
rision. Many years ago I became for a
brief period the owner of a number of
“triangular Capes,” black as the grave.
They had been part of the collection of
Trichardt, P.M.G. of the Transvaal.
When he and his fled before Plumer’s
advance on Pietersburg, he left his treas-
ures locked in a safe in his fine farm
homestead. My regiment included men
of many parts, and I wasn’t surprised
when I heard the lock of the safe had
been picked five minutes after we occu-
pied the farmstead and the books of
stamps abducted. H.Q. quickly issued
a trumpet blast ordering officers to
recover these stamps at once. “Troops”
were accordingly informed that ghastly
pains and penalties awaited those
having the stamps and not returning
them forthwith; the only result I got
was the discovery of a handful of
triangular and other early Cape stamps
on my bed-roll that night. Realising the
danger of holding them, I entrusted the
stamps to an old cobber who was return-
ing to Cape Town with his regiment, en
route to Australia, asking him to post
them to a given address. He took them,
all right, but forgot the rest of his in-
structions. Trichardt was rumored to
have recovered their value (£20,000)
from the British Government after the
war.
“Philatel”: I don’t know why black
should be regarded as hopelessly unsuit-
able for stamps, though the reason why
the Westralian authorities chose it 80
years ago is obvious —to emphasise the
black swan. The bird, as far as I remem-
ber, gradually lost its sableness in subse-
quent issues of postage stamps, but it re-
mained a genuine black on the revenue
stamps for a great many years, even till
after Federation, and there was no pret-
tier stamp in Australia. The most gro-
tesque stamp ever issued here was Charlie
Frazer’s creation when he was Labor
P.M.G. —an outline of the continent
with a huge kangaroo sprawled across it.
How any designer could ever have been
induced to perpetrate such a monstrosity
was a puzzle, but Frazer was genuinely
proud of it and ordered such an immense
stock that it lasted for years after his
death in 1913. Indeed, some of the higher
denominations are still used for parcels.
PURRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I detest the smoodgiiig type of politician who
purrs around electors like a tabby cat.” — Mr. 1\ F.
Luuylilin, M.L.A.
In days of old, when warriors bitted
Their way to place and fame,
The race was mostly to the swift,
The battle to the game;
Against the doughty arm that swung
The mace with vim intense,
Ihe scheming 'brain, the witching tongue
Supplied but poor defence.
Now knights no more o’er fields of gore
Are seen their chargers spurring,
A safer way to keep your job
Is found in smoodging to the mob
And purring, purring, purring.
Whoe’er to Parliament would win,
No matter when or where,
Must needs have votes to put him in
And votes to keep him there.
The iron hand, that knew no law
When out to smite and seize,
Has yielded to the iron jaw
(And neck) in times like these.
Crude stoush and scrap are off the map,
With war-cries wild and stirring;
The thing that counts, the stuff that pays
The best in these more genial days,
Is purring, purring, purring.
To state your views in terms exact
And straight-flung words denotes
A lamentable lack of tact
In one who’s out for votes.
Far better to remember, friend,
And lay it to your soul,
The fewer people you offend
The more you’re like to poll.
No better tip to boom your scrip,
It goes without averring,
Than honeyed hints of what you’ll do
For those who keep their faith in you,
And purring, purring, purring.
And each man thinks, when halls grow hot
With yap and hustings buzz,
It’s what he wouldn’t do but what
The other fellow does.
He takes his oath to tricks so low
He’ll never bow the knee —
Because we never see, you know,
Ourselves as others see.
Now, Heaven save us from the knave
Who public life is slurring
By snooping round and keeping sweet
With those to whom he owes his seat
By purring, purring, purring.

T. THE R.


“Findy”: All I had ever read of spirit
messages and voices from the past came
back to me on a recent Sunday morning
as I was passing Taronga Park, Sydney. A
radio set was playing a catchy nothing-
in-particular when suddenly the music
stopped and a voice announced drama-
tically : “Ladies and gentlemen, Mafeking
has been relieved.” Tumultuous applause
and hysterical cheering followed, and 1
passed on my way wondering whether
modern science had reached far enough
back into space to bring the voices of 34
years ago. It was the small boy of the
house who undeceived me. He insisted
that what I heard was merely a broad-
cast of the talkie “Cavalcade.”
“X.S.”: Touching “insulting words.”
A woman at South Melbourne was
charged with using such about the Bench.
“The words I used was ‘You beauties,’ ”
she remarked. His Washup smiled gently
and fined her two pounds.
“Old Hand”: Touching this “Australian
accent,” I have come to the conclusion
that no such thing exists. I have never
"That Cuthbert person thinks himself a lady-killer. All he does is make me
feel sick.”
yet detected the “wyte” for wait or the
“plyte” for plate, which some people
talk about. 1 heard Lord Burnham speak
at the Adyar Hall in Sydney, when
several of us laid ourselves out to note
any difference of speech from pur own
and could find none worth speaking of.
I have listened over the air to the King,
the Prince of Wales, Ramsay MacDonald
and many others, also President Roose-
veil and other Americans. The Ameri-
can accent was marked, but all the others
might have been ordinary Australian
speakers. It is much the same with Eng-
lish actors ; the late Dion Boucicault, to
quote only one instance, spoke as we do.
* ❖ *
“Lansdowne”: These cheerfully in-
accurate cricket-writers again! Dr. Bar-
bour records that “B. H. Lyon, who
batted so well for the Gentlemen at
Lord’s, is captain of the Gloucestershire
eleven and has hitherto been principally
known to Australians as the man who
wrote that Bradman has no strokes.
The Lyon who criticised Bradman was not
8.H., but his brother, M.D., a rising
barrister, who plays, or did play, for
Somerset. And M. D. Lyon, certainly
never said anything so foolish as that
Bradman had no strokes, although he did
exult, a trifle prematurely, at the dis-
missal of the Australian champion for a
small score after some of his phenomenal
early successes.
“Camberley”: The accommodating
spirit of pawnbrokers in Portsmouth
where junior naval officers were con-
cerned (B. 20/6/’34) was never confined
to naval depots. There must be a good
many old gentlemen in the junior service
—and as many young ones —who have
had cause to bless the name of Atten-
borough when they were cadets of
Sandhurst. When a pleasant evening
in the West End was sought the
impecunious cadet took his prismatic
compass and mapping instruments to the
obliging firm and received the standard
advance of two pounds. It was always
understood that when the cash came in
the instruments would be redeemed, their
stay in pawn rarely exceeding two or
three weeks.
* * =i= . *
“Heresone”: Touching the query about
“whinger” (B. 13/6/’34), “winjer” was
accepted slang for “grumbler” at Q.
Uni. a few years ago, and probably still
is. I have seldom heard it elsewhere,
and no one who uses it seems to know
the derivation.
“T.Y.1.”: Mention of Elizabeth Farm,
at Parramatta, built in 1793, as Aus-
tralia’s oldest building (B. 13/6/’34)
is a reminder of our comparative new-
ness. In the city of Sydney there are only
four buildings a century old ; the oldest is
the Commissariat store in George-street,
designed and partially erected in 1809,
and completed by Macquarie in 1811-12.
The District Court in Queen’s-square
dates from 1819, and the old Mint build-
ing belongs to the same period. St.
James’s Church in King-street was
only partially completed when the first
service was held there in 1822. Out-
side the city proper is Wentworth’s
home at Vaucluse, dating, in its present
form, from 1829. Mosman’s Barn was
erected in 1831. The King-street Supreme
Court falls a little short of the cen-
tury. From the ’thirties, too, come
Jamieson House and the row with
the tall windows and taller doors on the
opposite side of Jamieson-street. Among
the buildings ranked by most Sydney-
siders as ancient, St. Philip’s, on Church
Hill, goes back to 1848 only, and
the dormer-windowed Admiralty House
wasn’t erected until the ’fifties. Green
Oaks, Mort’s old home at Darling Point,
was completed in the ’forties.

“Runa”: Of course children love
bloodthirsty games (B. 20/6/’34). In
my youthful days at a school in Gis-
borne, Poverty Bay, M.L., the favorite
game was “Te Kooti,” wherein the deeds
of that doughty old warrior, as related
by our parents, were enacted by boys and
girls with great enthusiasm. The role of
“Te Kooti” was allotted to each one in
“C’mon, and over a quid!”
"Can’t possibly do it, ole chap,
unless you can change a fiver.”
turn, as it carried the privilege of dis-
posing of all opposition, demanding any
property from the other players, and
generally riding roughshod over the com-
pany. To finish up, each child was
ordered to bring a selected gift, invariably
something to eat, to propitate the next
day’s “Te Kooti.” We played it year in
and year out.
“Kerys”: Touching the appetite of
children for horrors, a M.L. lady once told
me of a poignant experience of her very
early youth. She was spending her school
holidays at an Auckland city parsonage.
A murderer was to be hanged next day,
and, as in those benighted times all exe-
cutions were public, and the scaffold, at
the corner of Queen and Victoria streets,
had been for days an object of consider-
able interest, she and the vicar’s daughter,
both 12-year-olds, determined to witness
the final scenes. Setting an alarm-clock
for 5.30 on a midsummer morning, they
rose and ascended to the attic, which
commanded a fine view of the free show.
The pair knelt at the window for half
an hour, and their exploit might have
passed unnoticed had not they both
shrieked with horror at the crucial
moment. One of them fainted and
finished up the sensation by falling back-
wards down the narrow stairs. A per-
turbed clergyman came home to discover
he was not the only member of his
family with a ghastly memory to live
with.
“The Antiquary”: The barney as to the
remote origin of Melbourne’s name isn’t
likely to be settled through Vic.’s cen-
tenary efforts. Of course, the city com-
memorates the British Prime Minister of
a century ago, Viscount Melbourne,
whose father took his title from the name
of the Derbyshire village where he had
his country estate. The hamlet figures in
Doomsday Book as “Mile-burn,” and in
other ancient records as Mill-burn, and,
since there were a brook and a mill there
when the great survey was made, it’s a
reasonable inference that Melbourne was
originally Mill-bourne. An alternative
explanation is that the name is an abbre-
viated corruption of “Michael’s-bourne,”
signifying the boundary of the Church of
St. Michael, for a church dedicated to
that saint stood at Millburn in Saxon
times.
#
“Craiser”: I once wrote a story about
a young man who suffers from con-
genital adiposity. He goes to the
tropics a thin youth, but his here-
ditary disposition grows; and when
his fiancee comes up to marry him, he
having concealed his physical state, she
finds him weighing 17 stone. Luckily
she had been concealing from him that
she was going the same way, and they
marry and grow happily fatter together.
I submitted this yarn to an editor.
He rejected it —quite rightly, I now
know. But a few years afterwards 1
started to read in a magazine a story
that seemed to be familiar. The setting
was Sydney’s North Shore, but as I read
on I realised I was reading my own plot,
w jth unimportant modifications. The
wr iter was the aforesaid editor. An
unconscious trick of memory, no doubt,
* * * *
“15th ’Ants”: Touching this anti-air-
craft shooting (B. 13/6/’34). I wonder
how many remember the large flight of
German aeroplanes that appeared in
broad daylight on the morning of Boxing
Day, 1917, flying exceedingly low and
very erratically over the lines of the 41st
Division in the Plontello sector of the
Italian front? Field-guns were hastily
laid on, and all hands in the division
grabbed rifles or revolvers and fired
furiously at targets that were not easy
to miss as they swayed unsteadily over
the treetops. Some half-dozen came
down, and from their pilots we gleaned
an explanation of their crazy antics. A
British squadron had bombed and almost
obliterated a Fritz Christmas-leave train,
and orders for a retaliatory raid had
arrived when the pilots were finishing
their characteristically thorough Christ-
mas celebrations. The two captured war-
birds that I saw were both well oiled.
“Jobber” on the long arm:
A cobber serving in the Boer War became
friendly with an Imperial man. My pal came
home, losing all trace of his friend. Fighting
under Chauvel, he got his issue, and was
put on a camel ambulance; the case in the
sling on the other side of-the camel turned
out to be his Tommy mate of South
Africa. After the Aussie’s return home, he
went back to his job with the Irrigation Com-
mission, where he had a lot to do with soldier
settlers. A new batch was sent up to the area,
and, as accommodation was a bit limited,
the boss told my pal he would have to let one
of the newcomers dig in with him. The new-
comer duly arrived —the same old soldier!
“S.V.”: Local philatelists are all agog
over the projected centenary exhibition
of rare stamps in Melbourne, a show
valued at £500,000 being expected.
Philately is a strange obsession. At the
last exhibition held in Melbourne some
years ago, collectors went pop-eyed over
a South American stamp whose value
lay in the fact that the printer, on this
occasion only, had reversed the water-
mark. It was priced at £5OOO. Possibly
he did it on purpose. It was a trick
frequently practised by the British North
Borneo Co., which administers a pro-
vince of the Empire bigger than Vic-
toria. Being hard up for cash, it
issued a succession of stamps with at-
tractive animal designs. Most of the
issues had a stamp or two with some
defect or other, and collectors the world
over sought them.
“R. Volt”: S. J. Chatfield was rid-
ing the four-year old Jeremal across a
damp bit of roadway near Parkdale rail-
way station (Vic.), when the animal
screamed, reared and fell dead. It was
found to have been electrocuted by a
vagrant voltage from the S.E.C. supply.
When a gang attempted to hoist the
carcass into a lorry by means of a steel
chain and winch, there was a pyrotech-
nic display. Chatfield escaped unhurt.
He was perfectly insulated by the saddle,
a rubber coat and rubber boots. The
only vulnerable parts of his anatomy
were his bare hands, and it happened
that that morning he had changed the
usual leather reins for a rubber pair.
ARTISTS ALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mannequins, according to Melbourne’s leading
dress designer, are artists who are born, not made.”
Poeta nascitur —how many a time,
Recalling it, with honest pride we’ve burned,
We blokes and coves who build the lofty
rhyme!
Non fit —an art like ours is never learned.
’Twas destiny that we should sweep the lyre
And pen the stuff that down the ages spins,
Compound of joy and sadness, tears and fire.
And faith! it’s just the same with manne-
quins.
Some crafts may be acquired by rote and code,
But others only the high gods bestow:
The trick of shaping villanelle and ode,
The knack of wearing frill and furbelow.
Fates, it may be, or fairies dealt our cards
Before we’d passed the age of safety-pins;
And some were earmarked there and then for
bards.
And some were preordained for mannequins.
We sing because, like birds, we needs must
sing,
And (if I know our tribe) we ever shall;
They pose and preen, parade and sway and
swing,
Because it’s absolutely natural.
None in this vale of tears may dodge his lot,
And if yoju think the corn that’s in the bins
Lured us to minstrelsy you’re off the spot—
We bards are born, not made, like manne-
quins.
Some with glad rags, some with glad rhymes
enthral;
But whether rolling eyes or dimpled chins
Suggest our trade, we’re artists—artists all,
From poetasters up to mannequins.

POLITICAL POINTS
One of Lang’s latest charges against
the Stevens Government is that it has
“twisted the moratorium law to suit the
moneylenders.” But who twisted the
moratorium law to suit the moneylender
that advanced £13,700 to the “Labor
Daily,” and who was the moneylender?
J. T. Lang.
Lyons spends a lot of time in Tas-
mania, and it looked queer to see him
rushing over there from the Loan Coun-
cil, with its work not half done and a
row with the Commonwealth Bank be-
“Anyhow, you can’t say we’re not in
the same boat now, Earle.”
ginning. He has been suffering from a
painful form of eye trouble; but that
wasn’t the reason. Earle Page was set-
ting out on a political tour of Tasmania,
and the P.M. wanted to get there at the
same time.
Relatives of old-age pensioners are not
now to be compelled to disclose their
incomes so that the department may de-
cide whether they can afford to help
them. This will mean dismissing 50 Gov-
ernment clerks and presumably another
amendment of the Act (there have
already been a dozen or so since 1931);
but an election approaches, and politi-
cians must be careful.
Single electorates with preferential vot-
ing might have saved the Nats, in the
Speck. But for P.R. they could not have
lost the seat that Pearsall (Ind.) won in
Franklin or the one that went to Becker
(Fed. Lab.) in Wilmot. Neither would Car-
ruthers, the Douglas Credit man, have
slipped in for Hobart. In the counting
of primaries none of the three got any-
where near his quota. Preferences capri-
ciously exercised (and not exercised) put
them where they are.
Melbourne’s new Milk Board actually
has some consideration for consumers.
Anyway, Kendall, the chairman, has
advised them that s£d. or 6d. a quart is
a fair retail price for bottled or un-
bottled in Melbourne, and “there is no
reason why people should pay more.”
There is no reason in Sydney either,
except the existence of the blessed “con-
trol system” introduced by Lang and
meekly continued by Stevens. Since it
arrived the consumer has paid 7d. a quari
for country milk and Bd. for suburban.
Weaver, the N.S.W. Minister of
Health, who proposes a free distribu-
tion of milk in Government schools, has
struck two snags. Cow-farmers supply-
ing Sydney refuse to let him have it for
less than lHd. a gallon (apparently they
would rather throw it away), and the
Teachers’ Federation won’t help unless
the milk is bottled. Weaver says he will
get it in spite of them.
S. M. Lock, who is distributing Pen-
fold’s wines in the U.S.A., has arrived
with the welcome report that the Ameri-
cans like the things our vintners sell,
particularly sherry and sparkling, and
that we have a great chance of captur-
ing the market. Banks are helping im-
porters of Australian wines with cheap
money, and indirectly helping to redress
the balance of trade, which has always
been heavily against Australia. The ad-
vantage on Uncle Sam’s side was nearly
£30,000,000 sterling in 1928-29.
The absurd central council of the State
C.P. continues to make Victorians grin.
It has “expelled” Dr. Harris, the party
leader in the Upper House, because of
“his refusal to sign the nomination
paper, as required”; and, to be consistent,
it should have expelled the C.P. Assem-
blymen who are admitting the “unen-
dorsed” Martin to their meetings in
defiance of orders. But it has left the
annual conference to deal with them.
Now it has cut off supplies to the Aus-
tralian C.P. organisation as a preliminary
to “winning Wannon, Bendigo and Indi
from the U.A.P.” It couldn’t win on a
Phar Lap if he were racing a mule.
While “protesting against two of the
unity proposals,” S.A.’s P.L.P. (remnants
of Hill’s Government) is willing to drop
the fight with Lacey’s A.L.P. There are
still two factions (Bardolph’s and How-
ard’s) to be heard from, the manufac-
ture of Labor parties having become one
of S.A.’s secondary industries.
The Langsters are running C. H. Han-
kin again for the Martin by-election.
W. V. McCall, who would be M.H.R.
for East Sydney if his party had been a
bit more energetic on election-day, is the
U.A.P. man, and the scholarly J. A. Mc-
Callum is taking a chance for the Fed.
Labs. All three are above the average,
and young as candidates go, though Mc-
Callum was wounded in Polygon Wood.
McCall is only 26.
South Africa has taken up the Aus-
tralian idea of a home-made Governor-
General, and is discussing the succes-

“Keen resentment is expressed by State Premiers at the attitude of the Commonwealth

sion to the Earl of Clarendon. General
opinion is that Smuts is the man. The
pro-Empire party sees in Smuts a sheet
anchor in the stormy days that may be.
Republicans, open and veiled, would
welcome the disappearance from active
politics of a formidable adversary.
Associations of taxpayers, which sprang
up when it seemed that the middle-class
might be taxed out of existence, have
been holding a Federal conference in
Sydney. They have been useful in many
ways; for example, in emphasising that
£6 a second is being taken from the
people’s pockets, and in pressing for
abolition of Federal land tax and the
6 p.c. slug and for uniformity in income-
tax laws. But, as W. M. Hughes told
them with a flash of his old fire, they
can never achieve very much while Aus-
tralia puts up with “dual government.”
Delegates to the taxpayers’ conference
learned with delight that the assessors
in the N.S.W. Taxation Department had
formed a branch union and were asking
for an award. The news engendered
wild hopes, which were dashed when it
was learned from a trustworthy source
that there was no chance of a strike.
The contempt in which modern Gov-
ernments hold Parliamentary control of
the public purse was illustrated when
Bruxner brought in a bill to “authorise
the erection of administrative and other
office accommodation for the Railway
Department at Wynyard station,” Sydney.
The foundations and half the frame had
been built.
As a reward for putting in a Labor
Government, Tasmania is to have an-
other salaried Minister —the fifth. Other
boons promised by Premier Ogilvie (not
O’Gilvie, as the “Age” calls him) include:
Annual increments to civil servants; re-
storation of half their pay deductions; a
round-the-State road; full work for the
unemployed at proper rates; relief for
soldier-settlers; establishment of a Bureau
of Commerce, as in Queensland, and of a
State Arbitration Court, and abolition of
high-school fees.
And every member of Mr. O’Gilvie’s (no,
Ogilvie’s) party of 14 “is irrevocably
pledged to the carrying-out of the policy
in its entirety.”
Many Tas. Nats, (ladies, perhaps) did
not trouble to mark their overlong ballot
papers in the order of their party prefer-
ences. After giving their man No, 1 they
voted alphabetically. Thus, when sitting-
member Atkinson (Nat.) was excluded
from the Wilmot count, 195 of his second
preferences went to Becker, the Fed.
Lab. man, and only 157 to Neil Camp-
bell, the Nat. Minister, and 75 to Cam-
eron, another Nat. Becker’s name was
next to Atkinson’s on the list. Campbell
and Cameron were elected, along with
ex-Premier Lee. But for the waste they
would have carried Best in with them ;
as it was, Becker beat Best by 46 votes.
There were results almost as fantastic in
other electorates.
Before the election A. G. Ogilvie de-
monstrated to his own satisfaction that
Tasmania was nearly broke under this
cursed Federation, and possibly it would
go bung if it had to find the money for
all his gaudy plans. But he has a better
notion than that. His round-the-State

owe me I’ll leave, and if you do
I’ll leave anyhow; so what are you
going to do about it?”
road, he says, “falls naturally within the
scope of the Federal-aided roads policy,”
and before the Speck secedes he will
press its claim for a special grant of
£1,099,536, and “possibly increase it in
the light of later information.”
A pleasing ceremony was witnessed in
Sydney last week when Mr. W. H.
Whiddori, “Hon. Director of the Golden
Chest” and seller of shares in Govern-
ment lottery tickets, bestowed on the
Golden Jest five crisp hundred-pound
notes. (Golden Jest and lottery shares
were mingled in ads. for the last Jest, and
it was announced that the committee was
paying.) Mr. Whiddon was made a life-
governor of institutions nourished by the
Golden Jest and “presented with an easy
chair.” Surely a superfluous gift for an
old gentleman so obviously living in
Easy-street.
Bruce, in London once more, describes
as “fantastic” the story that he claimed
to be speaking for the British Govern-
ment regarding import quotas at a con-
ference attended by Pease, Queensland’s
Deputy-Premier. Now the chairman of
the Commonwealth Bank Board has
denied two assertions of the same Pease:
(1) that the board delivered an “ulti-
matum” to the Premiers “that we must
arbitrarily allocate £1,500,000 out of the
£2,000,000 Commonwealth grant to meet
deficits,” and (2) it “forced a reduction
of estimated deficits from £6,750,000 to
£5,880,000.”
No stipulation was made that any por-
tion of the £2,000,000 should be applied
to reduction of deficits; or that deficits
should be limited to any amount.
Pease denounces the “arrogant overlord-
ship” of the board. He is perhaps an
authority on arrogance, though his com-
petency as a reporter may be questioned.
[For any political matter requiring a signa-
ture, J. E. Webb and J. B. Dailey, of 252
George-street North, Sydney, are responsible.]

When William Genge Webster, of

who are in their nineties. All three were

ber when Newcastle was mainly bark
huts.
If not as keen on Douglas Credit as
Carruthers, who is in for Denison (Tas.),
Edward Brocker, elected in the Labor in-
terest for Franklin, has pronounced lean-
ings that way. Like Carruthers, he is
English ; a 40-year-old mechanic with a
job at Cadbury’s. Brocker is a well-read
man with an attractive speaking voice.
P. J. Jansen, a Dutch mining engineer
who arrived in Sydney the other day,
brought news of Arthur J. Wyly, brother
of Bob, of Sydney C. G. A.J. has just
celebrated his silver jubilee in the service
of a powerful Dutch gold-mining con-
cern in Sumatra. He passed through the
assay office of E. W. Hawker, of Adel-
aide, was at the Boulder Perseverance
Mines in W.A., and drifted into oil-
treatment work in Mexico and gold-
treatment in France before the Dutch
East Indies called him.
A friend’s tribute:
Jimmy Osborne, as he was known to wide
circles in Sydney, Melbourne and London, had
an extraordinarily lovable and interesting mind
and nature. He was a grazier by inheritance
—the youngest son of Pat Osborne, of Curran-
dooley, he had owned Bowylie, near Yass, for
quarter of a century—but he touched life at
many other points. As a young man he fell
in love with Maud Jeffries, who was then
starring in Australia with Julius Knight, and
joined the company to be near her. He was
a good amateur actor and the possessor of a
beautiful voice and articulation, and when
he was given a chance to play lead in “Mon-
sieur Beaucaire” in Sydney, as Knight’s under-
study, he made a success of it. He was
educated at Rugby and had served in the
Boer War with a British cavalry regiment. It
left him permanently lame and caused his
rejection for the World War. After his mar-
riage to Miss Jeffries he devoted himself chiefly
to beautifying and improving his station. Like
other members of his family, he was devoted
to racing. A natural wit and raconteur, he
was one of the most popular members of the
sporting set in the Union Club, and the Bad-
minton Club always made him an honorary
member when he went to London. He is
survived by Mrs. Osborne and a son, Bed-
ford, who has been looking after Bowylie
for several years.
C. J. Kenny will shortly cease to be
housekeeper of Vic. Leg. Assembly. He
has housekept for 49 years, and can
remember when the commanding figure
of Peter Lalor filled the Speaker’s chair.
“N’lmporte”: Kate Baker, who re-
vived the memory of “Tom Collins”
(Joseph Furphy) when that writer was
in danger of being forgotten, is now at
work on a scheme to immortalise him at
Shepparton (Vic.), where he lived for 20
years, and where “Such Is Life” was
written. A tablet in or on a building is
suggested.
Frank Tate, Victoria’s former Director
of Education, who has just had a birth-
day, is one of Australia’s busiest septua-
genarians. He was chiefly responsible
for the visit of librarian Ralph Munn,
of the Carnegie Corporation, who has
been saying such hard things about
our public libraries. At 71 Tate is
doing more strenuous work as president
of the Australian Council of Educational
Research than could be expected of
most men of fifty.
Last week, while Reg Weaver, M.L.A.,
was threatening if necessary to milk cows
himself in the interests of the thirsty

threatening to milk cows.
Weaver is the Stevens Government’s chief
th reatener, some qualifications being a
powerful voice and a terrifying mien
when roused. He got into the Assembly
years ago on an inspiring slogan—
“ Weaver Won’t Wobble.” True to his
word, he hasn’t wobbled from that day
to this. As Minister for Health, he
spends a good deal of time refusing to
wobble on the subject of the State lot-
tery, which his chief regards as Satanic.
His task has been made more difficult
of late by reason of the fact that the
thing is slumping and has caused a worse
slump in direct giving to hospitals. Hence
his chronically enraged appearance.
This is how the frail, shy young man
who has just become Professor of Eng-
lish at Sydney Uni. looked to Will

English literature. Some of his assets as
a lecturer, apart from an intimate know-
ledge of the work, are an engaging voice
and manner.
“8.5.”: When chief stewardess Phil-
lips, of the E. and A. line, went through
Sydney Heads on the China-bound Nel-
lore the other day, she began her 300th
deep-sea voyage. Sailors say she is the
world’s most-travelled seawoman. She
has been on the job since she was left a
widow during the Boer War. She stuck
to the Kyarra when it was comman-
deered for transport work* in the World
War, figured in a bout with a U-boat,
nursed on the Wyreema in the influenza
epidemic and was aboard the Kanowna
when she hit the neighborhood of Wil-
son’s Promontory. She comes from
Queensland.
“Jeames” on some persons above-
stairs :
Prince Serge Obolensky, co-re. in James v.
James, the cause celebre of the moment in
London, had a job in Sydney 10 years ago.
Tall, handsome, dark-haired and blue-eyed, he
was a typical Oxford product, like his friend
Prince Youssoupoff, the slayer of Rasputin,
whose wife got libel damages recently
from an American film company. Prince Serge,
who, with his cousin of Melba’s last opera
company, was ruined financially by the Russian
revolution, had a job here with Vickers Maxim
which eventually took him back to London.
There he married an heiress. The husband
of Mrs. Edward James, the lady in the case,
who is one of the beauties of the day, is the
immensely rich son of Mrs. Willie James.
The Jameses’ principal country house is in
Sussex, near Goodwood. Edward VII., as
Prince of Wales, used to stay at Goodwood
House, which is on the Chichester side of the
racecourse, till its owner, the grandfather of
the present Duke of Richmond, objected to
some of the guests nominated for the meeting
by H.R.H. From then onward Edward always
stayed with the more latitudinarian Mrs. Willie
James.
A. J. } Villiers, the Australian pressman
who shipped before the mast on a sail-
ing-ship as a means of getting copy, did
so well out of the book and movie which
resulted that he has been able to buy
the Georg Stage, a Norwegian wind-
jammer. She sails from Plymouth for
Australia in September with British boys
as half her complement.
“Lex” : Norman Lockhart, who aban-
doned his job as N. S. Wales Registrar
in Bankruptcy last week amid the lamen-
tations of Bench and Bar, is a brisk,
dapper, absurdly young-looking little
man to have been retired on the ground
of age. It inspired E. J. Loxton, K.C.,
to some caustic remarks on the stupidity
of a system which leads to the scrapping
of such men in their prime. Lockhart
went to England early in the war, joined
up with the R.F.A., and got an 0.8. E.
He is a cadet of the Sinclair-Lockhart
family, which has offshoots in M.L. as
well as in Australia. The present (12th)
baronet, for example, was educated in
M.L., and his mother’s father was Cap-
tain Power, of Sydney.
Commander H. T. Bennett, R.N. (ret.),
goes as hydrographer with the Common-
wealth expedition to inquire into trans-
port and shipping facilities for opening
up the Barkly Tableland. Nobody knows
the terrain better. He commanded
H.M.A.S. Geranium when she sounded
the northern waters, and before that he
surveyed for the R.N. off the coasts of
the Sultan of Brunei, in Borneo. Bennett,
in addition to being a seaman, is a first-
class film photographer. He did interest-
ing work amongst the ’gators and the
blacks in an amateur capacity which later
gained him a job with Herschell’s.
“Old Scot”: Frank Shew, of Scotch
College, Melbourne, who has died at 83,
was one of those oddities who at times
make great schoolmasters. He lacked the
mysterious quality which enables some
men to impose dead silence on a class the
moment they appear. His almost com-
pletely bald head, which resembled a
brown egg, would be bowed over his
work, when he would suddenly become
aware that indiscipline was afoot. This
was the signal for him to leap to his feet
and denounce the offenders; and his
system worked. He was a student at
Scotch for seven years, and a teacher for
53, and almost to the day of his dearth
he made,a practice of revisiting his old
haunts.
“D.”: Max Baer is the first heavy-
weight boxing champion of the world
who has won the title after starring in
the movies, the first Jewish world cham-
pion that America has produced, and the
only one since Jack Johnson with a sense
of humor. “Last up’s a sissy,” Max’s
blithesome remark to Camera as they
grovelled on the canvas together, was the
kind of joke Johnson would have cracked
if anybody had managed to get him
down. When Tommy Burns threatened
to throw an inkpot at him in Sydney
Johnson pointed to a child aged six or
seven whom he used to take about in his
car. “There are ladies present, Tahmmy,”
he cried chidingly.
Eric Leslie Callaway, of Sydney, who,
at 30 is manager of Tooheys, was born

way, the umpire, and Sid Callaway, an
uncle, played for Australia. His father

and business responsibilities bodylined
him.

For 20 years to the close of accounts
in 1929, divs. averaged 15.8 p.c. But
the quick post-war development of the
business,followed by the collapse of prices,
increased the risks and reduced earnings,
and the div. fell to 2| p.c. for the two
years to the close of accounts in 1933.
Of the £2,400,000 of capital, £1,149,151,
which brought with it £761,113 of share
premiums, was gathered during the half-
dozen years to the end of March, 1930.
The new money, together with over a
million of borrowed funds, was put out
largely in advances on stock and station
properties, etc., all over Australia. To
protect these advances, £420,000 was
whisked away to inner reserves at the
end of March, ’33.
During the last term all sections of
the business contributed more to the
pool, and not much, if any, of the
£420,000 just referred to was required.
For the nine months to the end of March
wool averaged £2O Bs. 6d. a bale, or over
82 p.c. more than the average for the
three preceding seasons. Sheep and cattle
prices were up, too. So, although the
co. sold and shipped 9122 fewer bales
(318,035), there was a spring of £107,030
in gross earnings:—>

paying debenture interest and sending an
extra £lOOO to the provident fund, the net
result sprang £118,846, reaching 8.1 p.c.
on capital as against 3.2, 2.6, 4.7, 9.5,

The money that came in was invested
mostly in liquids, up £603,217, which
nearly twice covered the floating debt.
Properties and stock (the co.’s own runs)
were down £23,161, notwithstanding the
rise in prices. The growth of £29,454 in
premises, etc., was due to the erection of
a new wool-store in Brisbane, completed
since the close of accounts.
The fully-paid pound shares fetched
51s. 3d. five years ago ; they dropped to
18s. 6d. before Britain went off gold, and
rose from 275. 3d. to 325. over the last
12 months. The return at 325. is 3.7 p.c.
on a 6 p.c. div. basis, or 4.3 p.c. on a
7 p.c. distribution. To pay the debenture
interest and 7 p.c. on capital would call
for 4.1 p.c. on total funds (debentures,
capital and reserves combined).
For the coming season the Australian
clip is estimated at 3,146,000 bales (up
151,000), though the dryness outback in
N. S. Wales and Queensland may mean
an early revision of the figures. The
statistical position of fine wool is favor-
able, but the attitude of Germany and
Italy with regard to national trade
balances, etc., makes prices very un-
certain.

claim of £2674 in respect of the lapsed
lease was charged direct to reserves;
other claims in connection with this lease
are to be similarly dealt with when de-
termined. Greater Union and Films
(Holdings) are said to have earned a
profit, but not enough to pay a div.
A clear view of the position is blotted
out by a network of interlocking cos.,
over whose figures a curtain is kept
drawn. Wljen Union Theatres went
into liquidation, the four holding
cos. in which the public is interested
(Greater J. D. Williams, West’s, Spen-
cer’s and Amalgamated) formed another
group, chief of which was Greater
Union, to take over the assets. Greater
Union’s * original paid capital was
£18,000; it issued another £70,000 for
debts taken over, and put out a further
312,000 bonus shares. The £400,000 of
capital thus arrived at was held as
follows:

Not less than 20 p.c. of the net earnings
were to go to the liquidator of the old
business until trade creditors were paid
in full. So Greater Union would need to
net lj p.c. or more to pay a 5 p.c. div.
At the beginning of 1933 Hoyts and
Union linked up their city interests
through General Theatres Corp. There-
upon Australasian Films (formed in
1913 to do the hiring, etc., for the old
Union Co.) went into liquidation, and
three new cos. —British Empire Films,
Cinesound Productions and General
Theatres Supplies—took over the busi-
ness. The shares in the three are held
by Films (Holdings), Ltd.
The recent inquiry into the industry
in N. S. Wales resulted in a recommen-
dation that there be no restriction in
granting licenses for picture theatres. So
three of the big American distributors
and the Hoyts-Union group, which has
bought the Universal Film Co.’s pictures
for 1934, have an open field in which
to fight their trade battles.

Trade generally was better last year;
yet Foy’s had to fight hard to hold busi-
ness, owing to competition from chain
stores, which had recently set up in the
neighborhood, and others. Gross earn-
ings (£216,041) fell away £8223. A
tight hold was kept upon exes. (£223,431),
which were pulled back £6293 ; still,
the net result was £7390 on the wrong
side, though it was £12,001 better than
the previous year’s. That leaves out of
the reckoning an unexplained addition
of £10,868 (£16,800 in the previous term)
to the capital assets reserve (now
£27,668) ; so the co. may have done a
bit better.
The trouble began with reconstruction
of the main premises about seven years
ago. The old building, together with
£112,500 of reserves, was demolished.
The new one, which cost a lot more than
was expected, included an extra five
storeys, and the board went to its bankers
for most of the money, raising the over-
draft to £349,337 at March 15, 1931.
The work interfered with earnings, and
the 5 p.c. bonus was jettisoned in ’29,
leaving the div. at 10 p.c. It dropped to
8 p.c. in the following year. Then slump
gave earnings a nasty jolt, while taxa-
tion and the weight of the overdraft made
it impossible to get overhead back in
proportion, and losses have been re-
corded for each of the last four years.
Still, there was an encouraging im-
provement in the financial position dur-
ing the last term, thanks to addition to
the capital assets fund and allowance for
depreciation, etc.:

To clip £39,980 off the overdraft
(£298,573) and carry an extra £13,549 of
book debts, the stocks item was reduced
by £29,477, and £7260 was added to the
amount coming to trade creditors. On
fixed assets £13,610 more was written
off than was spent. The spring in the
more or less liquid surplus (£86,876, in-
cluding stocks, the most vulnerable point
in the co.’s armor) was £17,087.
Turnover improved towa'rds the close
of accounts, and the market expects that
payments to the prefs., which it prices
at * 19s. 3d., will not be long delayed.
Allowing for the statutory cut, there will
be £47,800-odd, approximately 3s. 6d. per
share, coming to them at next balance.
This and the overdraft may stand in the
way of the ords. for a while. They are
priced at 14s. as against 11s. 9d. a year
ago. The net tangible cover is £3 9s. 1 Id.
prefs. and 275. 3d. ords.

Though this big Fiji merchant and plan-
tation-owner earned enough to again pay
its pref. div., plus 4 p.c. to the ords., dur-
ing the last term, the pound ords., cov-
ered by net tangibles with a book value
of 255. lid., have fallen to 16s. 6d. in the
market. The return at that price is 4.8
p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis. Chief doubt
is what effect the fall in the price of
copra, upon which activity in island trad-
ing largely depends, will have upon the
future of the business.
Over the half-dozen years to the close
of the latest accounts, the London price
of South Sea copra fell from £27 to
£7 ss. per ton, the slip during the last
term being £4 15s. Gross earnings, which
were £166,785 in 1928, fell to £106,953
last year, when the contraction was
£4910. There was little change in exes.
(£76,154). Including £3473 dropped into
the insurance fund (£38,573), there was
enough to pay the pref. div. and show a
trifle over 4 p.c. on the £520,407 of ord.
capital as against 4.8, 2.7, 7.9, 11.5, 12.2
and 11.6 p.c. back to 1928.
The outlook for the current term is
mixed. A substantial portion of the
co.’s business is not dependent upon the
copra industry, and in these districts
prospects are reasonably good, while
losses experienced in the copra areas
during the last 12 months are not likely
to be recurrent, the chairman says. Still,
unless the price of copra rises enough
(speaking generally, it is now below cost
of production), it may become neces-
sary to use a major portion of the re-
to write down the book value of
the assets concerned. But unless condi-
tions become worse, the 4 p.c. div. may
not be interfered with.
Over the two years to the close of
accounts in 1932, £35,000 was openly
struck off the book value of plantations,
and reserves were tapped for a further
£12,400 to meet hurricane losses —fire
risks are cbvered outside in the ordinary
way. Here is the position as balance-
sheet figures show it:

For the first quarter of this century
divs. and bonuses together averaged ap-
proximately 15 p.c. The bonuses (Is.
per share) were mostly capitalised,
£ll,OOO being thus provided during the
15 years to the end of Oct., 1925, when
the gifts ceased. Then, to furnish funds
for the erection of new premises, etc.,
£19,593 of fresh capital, which brought
with it £24,458 of share premiums, was
gathered, raising paid capital, to £49,593
(its present figure) in 123,983 £1 shares
paid to Bs. At the end of April it was
visibly supported and assisted by £64,091
of reserves. So the two combined need
net only 2.6 p.c. to pay a 6 p.c. div. on
capital alone, or 3.5 p.c. to pay an 8 p.c.
div. ; and that disregards whatever profit
there may be from the trust and agency
business, growth of which can be ex-
pected to continue.
Last year £693,426 of new business
(£96,788 less than in the previous year)
was put on the books, and capital dis-
tributions to beneficiaries totalled
£619,892, leaving the net growth in trust
funds at £73,534:

Gross earnings were £l2ll better, and
exes, were £1 per cent, lighter, the net
result being 9 p.c. on capital as against
8,8, 13.7, 17 and 16.9 p.c. back to 1929.
So shareholders’ prospects of a bit better
than 6 p.c. appear to be bright enough.
At 14s. 9d. the scrip returns 3.2 p.c.
on a 6 p.c. div. basis, or 4.3 p.c. on an
8 p.c. distribution. The cover is 18s. 4d.

This Melbourne co. manufactures bis-
cuits and other foodstuffs. One of its
subsidiaries turns out ice-cream and an-
other handles dehydrated fruits and vege-
tables. Of the spring of £11,262 in last
year’s net earnings, £8096 came from a
reduction in the charge for “rates and
taxes, including provision for taxation,
£2725.” Whether in the previous and
preceding years the taxgatherer over-
charged the co. or the co. overcharged
itself in this respect is not stated
in the report. The leap of £62,819 in
gross earnings (£90,177) and of £51,557
in exes. (£75,685) was due mainly to an
alteration in the method of presenting the
accounts. However, the £14,492 of profit
claimed was enough to pay a full year s
pref. div. and show 4.2 p.c. on ord.

A CARPENTER
A HEARTY, cheerful man he is, and he
attributes much of his peace of mind to the
fact that he has been a member of the A.M.P.
for many years, and enjoys the security that
membership gives.
“I early found out,” he says, “that all the well-to-do
people in the community were members of the
A.M.P., and that I could be a member on exactly
the same terms as any of them. I decided that if
the A.M.P. suited a man with a large income it
would suit me and my income. It gave me a good
feeling to think that my shillings were just as care-
fully invested and protected as the other fellow’s
pounds.
“It pays a man to join the A.M.P. when he is young.
My policy, in which I invest £2/17/- a quarter,
would be worth £947 to my wife if I died to-
morrow. I think that every working man should
join the A.M.P. It gives him a solid sense of
security.”
Good advice. The wise man will ask the nearest
A.M.P. office to send an experienced counsellor to
talk things over with him; or he will write for a copy
of “Investing in Happiness,” which tells how the
Society helps its members.

capital. But payments to the prefs. had
fallen behind, so £12,000 of the arrears
was wiped out, leaving £15,000 (= 3s.
per share) still to come at next balance.
There are 100,000 of them, 6 p.c.
cumulative, which advance with the ords.
beyond that rate. Prospects of their slate
being cleaned are encouraging. Hence
the market prices the scrip (fully-paid
to £1) at 28s. as against 16s. 6d. a year
ago. Allowing for the final div., the
return at 28s. on a 6 p.c. div. basis is
4.5 p.c. plus arrears (Is. lOd. per share).

The book value of fixed assets was re-
duced by £24,940, rolling stock (in at
£18,765 at the previous balance) having
disappeared from the sheet. This and a
reduction of £8479 in debtors’ balances
and the year’s surplus earnings enabled
£13,443 to be added to stock, £3050 to be
snipped off the trade debt, £12,600 off
mortgages, etc., and £15,664 off the over-
draft, thus lightening overhead. The
year’s improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£52,835) was £36,262.
After the trouble in the ’nineties it
took 18 years for the div. to climb to
5£ p.c. Then the war provided new
opportunities, trade was opened up with
Southern Asia and 10 p.c. was paid for
the three years to 1920. For the next
decade the average was 7.4 p.c.
By suspension of forward dealing in
gold shares —it was one result of the
Tullamore affair —Sydney Stock Ex-
change has sought to protect the un-
sophisticated gambler against himself,
just as it did in connection with indus-
trial stocks early in 1930. If the Gov-
ernment tests at Tullamore had been
made early instead of late, much trouble
would have been avoided, of course. But
for the Government to sample every
prospect before it is offered to the public
would be no effective guarantee against
the kind of trouble that has occurred.
The best way out appears to be for the
Legislature to provide a sufficiently
strong deterrent.

Australian Mining Trust has taken
over the Brown Hill slimes, Kalgoorlie
(W.A.), on “favorable terms.” One dump
of 1,000,000 tons is expected to average
33 grains, and another of 800,000 tons 31
grains, giving the two dumps combined
an approximate value of 12s. per ton,
the chairman says. Horseshoe’s work-
ing costs are around 2s. 2d. a ton.
If the trust can approximate this figure
there should be a tidy profit in the dumps.
The co. has optioned the Commodore,
Islington, Islington South and Lady Cen-
tral, Meekatharra (W.A.), and has its eye
upon a tin show in N.Q., where, for the
expenditure of a few thousand pounds,
41,000 tons of ore is expected to yield
a profit of £61,000. For every share
held, those on the register got 150 shares,
fully paid to 10s., in the Forsayth Co.
(Q.), the trust’s first offshoot, last year.

Giandarra’s Kiandra (N.S.W.) property

R. S. Richards, member for Wallaroo
in the S. Aus. Assembly, says co-opera-
tive work goes on steadily at the old
Wallaroo-Moonta mines, where 50,000
tons of payable stuff is handy, and only
about one-third of the co.’s 5000 acres
has been touched. The low price of the
metal is the trouble.

Large deposits of high-grade dolomite
have been proved at Smithton, on the
n.-w. coast of Tas., and the Australian
Magnesium Co. is preparing to work
them. A factory, in which the various
magnesium compounds and their by-
products will be produced, is to be put
up near by. Later the manufacture of
metallic magnesium, light and heavy
magnesium carbonates and oxides, etc.,
may be undertaken. An experimental
plant has been in operation for some
months, and satisfactory results have
been obtained.
Edna May (W.A.) Amalgamated has
been launched in Melbourne with a
nominal capital of £200,000 in 4s. shares,
of which the vendors take 173,500
paids, and 600,000 have been snapped,
mostly by shareholders in Australian
Gold Development. The co. is to un-
water and develop the Edna May
group, Westonia, which closed down in
1922 owing to water trouble and high
costs. Later two unsuccessful efforts
were made to raise enough capital to
reopen the mines. N. S. Stuckey and
T. R. Victor figure that there is at least
160,000 tons of free milling stuff, aver-
aging between the 810 ft. level
and the surface. With gold at £8 an
ounce (Australian currency), and allow-
ing £31,000 for contingencies, this is
expected to yield a profit of £350,000.
There are three proved lodes, and hopes
are that development will disclose a lot
more payable ore.

Norseman (W.A.), to the surprise of
many and to the dismay of the bears,
produced £lO,OOO worth of bullion last
month, and has declared a shilling div.,
payable July 30. High-grade ore is

No. 4 level. The co. recently issued

Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) did well in

£114,215 of profit was £5589 better than
the 1932 figure and nearly double that
of 1931. Four Is. divs. were paid, and
the market is expecting a bonus when

Great Boulder (W.A.) continues to pay
3d. per share quarterly. When the new
mill, now being hurried to completion,
is in operation, shareholders should get
a little more. A comprehensive report
by Ernest Williams is expected to reach
the London board shortly.

London’s strong liking for North Kal-
gurli (W.A.) continues. Ore reserves at
471,475 tons, averaging 9.2dwt., are im-
pressive for a venture of this size, and
they are steadily growing. The output
will shortly be increased from 3500 tons
to 5000 tons a month, and profits are
expected to respond.

Lancefield (W.A.) was listed in Lon-
don for the first time on May 16, and
sterling prices ranged from 9s. 6d. to 10s.
The old Lancefield produced about
360,0000 z. of fine gold and some silver
from 1,000,000 tons of ore. About
430,000 tons of now-payable stuff is said
to have been left behind. Ore treatment
is scheduled to begin early in 1935.

On the advice of Theo Leonard, for-
merly field super, for Great Boulder
Prop., S. Aus. Oil Corp. has taken a six
months’ option over the Wiluna Ajax,
north of the Moonlight group (W.A.).
The lode, from 10ft. to 30ft. wide, runs

Including £13,098 brought forward,
N. Kalgurli finished its last fiscal year
with a p. and 1. credit of £34,834, or little
more than sufficient to pay the 6d. div.
just disbursed. Here is a co. with a
mine capable of furnishing 10,000 tons
to 15,000 tons a month for treatment
content to jog along with an output of
only 5000 tons. It is a strange policy,
and, what is stranger still, shareholders
don’t appear to mind.

(1) Yes, reduced earning power. (2) The
market, which expected a lift in the div., paid
quarterly, has got tired of waiting. (3) As a
long-term investment, and subject to political
developments, yes. C.B.S. for preference. (4)
If nationalisation is to be made a prominent
political issue, yes. (5) Industrials....
Inquirer: If safety of capital is important, keep
out of any concern which does not disclose its
financial position. Speaking generally, the
higher the return the greater the risk
W.C.P.: (1) A gamble. (2) Speculation with
fair prospects. (3) An investment A.K.M.:
See B. 5/7/’33 ... .H.C.M.: (1) Encouraging;
co. netted 10.3 p.c. on capital last year, and
paid 7 p.c. (2) You may have to wait for
a while, but prospects look bright enough.
(3) Appears to be fully priced.... Sawyer Bill:
A long-term speculation. The investments
belong to shareholders, not bondholders. See
B. 20/5/’34 H.C.W.: Immediate loss may
prove to be the smallest in the long run....
W.G.: You are liable for the full amount of
the share (face value) as and when called upon,
but for no more. Forfeiture must be for the
benefit of the co., not the shareholder. Ques-

OBJECTS
The company has been formed for the purpose of acquiring from the vendor
company gold-mining leases at Westonia, Western Australia, numbers 3447 (24
acres) and 3308 (12 acres), as well as application for gold-mining lease number
3467 (12 acres), comprising in all 48 acres, together with all plant, buildings, tools,
piping, rails, timber, stores, etc., at present on the properties. It is proposed to
unwater the mines, erect a new power and treatment plant, and to pursue a
vigorous policy of developmental work.
The leases to be acquired by the company embrace the workings of the well-
known EDNA MAY, EDNA MAY CENTRAL, EDNA MAY DEEPS, EDNA MAY
CONSOLIDATED, and McCAHON’S GOLD MINES, which, up to the time when
operations ceased, had produced 294,4630 z. of gold from 412,273 tons. The value
of this output on the present price of gold in Australian currency would be approxi-
mately £2,500,000. Prior to closing down some very handsome dividends were
paid, but the exceedingly high prices of all mining requisites following the war
period, and the extremely adverse effect of the Burnside Award, which would have
involved the companies in considerably increased wages, caused all the mines to
close down. Adding to their difficulties, the Edna May Company, which controlled
the pumping plant for the field, closed down with all ore reserves depleted, and owing
to the heavy costs of mining and excessive pumping charges the remaining mines
were unable to carry on profitably with gold at the old standard price of 84/- per
ounce. These mines were wet, but little trouble was experienced in meeting the
maximum flow of water, and with the installation of a modern pumping plant it is
not anticipated that any great difficulty will be experienced in unwatering and
coping with the existing flow of water. According to the reports of Messrs. N. S.
Stuckey and T. R. Victor, the estimated ore reserves to the 8 I Oft. level are calculated
on a conservative basis to contain approximately 160,000 tons, averaging 1 I
Future developmental work will doubtless disclose considerably increased ore reserves.
As all the ore is free milling, a very high extraction is assured.
LISTING ON STOCK EXCHANGES
Applications will be made in due course to have the shares listed on the Stock
Exchanges of Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth.
MINING ENGINEERS’ REPORTS
The reports of the following well-known mining engineers are contained in the
full prospectus, and may be inspected at the registered office of the company or
at the offices of the company’s brokers.
Mr. Thomas R. Victor, Mining Engineer, Melbourne.
Mr. N. S. Stuckey, Mining Engineer, Perth.
ORE RESERVES AND SURPLUS
Taking gold at £8 per ounce in Australian currency, the approximate surplus
likely to be shown from the estimated ore reserves is as follows:
160,300 tons containing 90,5000 z £724,000
LESS estimated cost of unwatering and other capital and
preparation costs, including costs of power plant,
standard mill, cyanide plant, breakers, etc £BB,OOO
Mining and milling £255,000
Contingencies £31,000 £3 74,000
Approximate surplus £350,000
These figures are confirmed in the report of Mr. N. S. Stuckey, Mining Engineer,
and late mine manager of the Edna May Deeps, and supported by Mr. T. R. Victor.
Mr. Stuckey’s intimate knowledge of the Edna May properties cannot be questioned,
because he was on the field from the time when work commenced from the grass
loots until the mines closed down in 1922. No provision has been made for probable
Extension to existing ore reserves, which should result from future developmental work. |

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Lazy River”
An old-time melodrama, with a few
modern touches, at the St. James. The
background is an American river in ter-
ritory where the smuggling of Chinese is
carried on —the contraband being
dumped overboard in chains when a
revenue cutter appears. Another modern-
istic feature is a gaol-escape sequence.
The hero (Robert Young) and comic olf-
siders are ex-convicts. The village hero-
ine, complete in artless straw hat, is Jean
Parker. The villain, a grim, unsmiling
Chinese, owns a river. steamer. He and
his minions are derided at intervals by
the comedians, and finally one of them
saves the hero from the fate of the
smuggled Chinese above-mentioned, and
the villain is dragged off to expiate his
crimes.
“Men in White”
It is odd in the film which follows
“Lazy River” to find the dastardly
Chinese reappearing, with no facial differ-
ences worth mentioning, as a benevolent
doctor. If the talkies are ever killed it
will be by this kind of thing. There are
so many of them and so few stars, so
much underplaying and so little make-
up, that most performers are virtually the
same in every production. In “Men in
White” we have Clark Gable and Myrna
Loy looking, talking, dressing and be-
having as in dozens of previous films.
In the days of the legitimate drama an
actor such as Charles Hawtrey, who
could be himself on the stage, was a
delightful rarity; almost everybody is
doing it on the screen, and the spec-
tacle is getting monotonous.
The interest, apart from the clash of
temperaments between the rising young
doctor and the rich girl to whom he gets
engaged, depend on the drama of the
sick-room and operating table. If you
want to see how patients are anaesthetic-
ised, given injections and carved up in
the best U.S.A. hospitals see “Men in
White.” It has few other excuses for
existence.
“The Crime Doctor”
This picturisation (and Americanisa-
tion) of a Zangwill novel, which heads
the bill at Sydney Capitol, tells its story
very directly and effectively. An emi-
nent crime investigator (Otto Kruger)
whose wife (Karen Morley) loves another
man (Nils Asther) frames his rival on a
murder charge. The achievement, it is
suggested, is an example of the “perfect
crime,” but as its details depended on
a concatenation of fortuitous circum-
stances the crime expert did not require
to be abnormally clever. However, the
acting is good and the interest doesn’t
flag. A defect in the casting is the use
of Asther, whose foreign accent is pro-
nounced, to impersonate an American.
“Keep ’Em Rolling”
Benny Walsh (Walter Huston), of the
U.S.A. Field Artillery, looks after a gun-
team horse named Rodney. Rodney
goes to France. All the other horses in
his team are shot, and Benny, after being
wounded, mounts Rodney, who hauls
into action by himself a piece of ord-
nance that looks as if it weighed a couple
of tons —also a fully-furnished ammuni-
tion limber.
Not only did this marvellous little
animal substantially assist America to
win the war as described, but it carried
on in the gun-team for another 18 years.
A hard-hearted major ,then declared that
Rodney must be sold, whereupon his
sweetheart jilted him and Benny went
a.w.l. with the steed. The major, to
get his fiancee back, pulled wires and
had Rodney put on the retired list and
Benny appointed as his groom.
In the cast of this pathetic opus are
“the officers and men of the 16th Field
Artillery, U.5.A.,” who give some stir-
ring demonstrations of battery drill.
Why Graham McNamee Smiles
One of the many reasons for the
smirk which eternally decorates the fea-
tures of “The Talking Reporter” may be
observed at the Capitol this week. The
monologuist presents scenes of ruin aris-
ing out of a fearful earthquake that re-
cently destroyed “Whangane” in Maori-
land. No more appalling convulsion,
says Mr. McNamee, has devastated M.L.
for 40 years. The damage done ran
into millions. The pictures may have
been taken at Napier in February, 1931 ;
but they might equally be mementoes
of the San Francisco ’quake, which
natives of that city prefer to call “the
fire.”
“Miss Fane’s Baby Is Stolen”
A film at Sydney Liberty which is
inspired by the American kidnapping
racket. Dorothea Wieck is Miss Fane, a
widowed screen actress who adores her
infant' son. When he is stolen from his
sumptuous nursery, Miss Wieck regis-
ters grief in a series of hysterical out-
bursts, which, while exactly what one
“ROMAN SCANDALS" AT SYDNEY STATE.
Emperor Valerius (Edward Arnold ) has an unprofitable dicing session with Eddie
Cantor. The Princess Sylvia (Gloria Stuart) in the offing.
would expect from a screen actress, are
extremely tiresome to watch. The police
take charge, and the audience is given
interesting glimpses of a nation-wide
organisation employing every imagin-
able method of search and propaganda
to defeat , the kidnappers. Alice Brady,
as a genial farmer’s wife and mother of
a horde of children, eventually rescues
the infant. Her cheerful naturalism con-
trasts strongly with the tempestuous be-
havior of Miss Wieck. There is nothing
exciting about the kidnappers. They are
just petty criminals who lose their nerve
as soon as the law gets busy.
It’s a morbid effort, but the onlooker
feels that this is just what does happen
in most U.S.A. kidnapping cases.
“Show Off”
Spencer Tracy is the exuberant hero.
He thinks he can run the railway com-
pany in which he is a clerk more effi-
ciently than the president. Conceit
impels him to pose as a wealthy man
outside office hours, and Madge Evans
is swept off her feet by his artifices. After
marriage he gets into debt, and is sacked
for a piece of impudent meddling which
costs his company a lot of money. Madge
returns to her mother and Tracy goes on
the American equivalent of the dole.
Of course, he makes a brilliant come-
back, and the fade-out finds him the same
loud-voiced skiter as he was at the begin-
ning.
As; a study of a fairly common type of
social pest, the film has a certain value.
It is also very well acted.
Sundry Shows
F. W. Thring’s invasion of Sydney com-
menced officially on Friday night, when,
at the New Tiv. (it used to be the “Grand”
Opera House), “Collits’ Inn” —music by
Mrs. Varney Monk, Harry Jacobs and
Howard Carr ; libretto by Tom Gurr —
was spread before the audience upon a
revolving stage. The piece is rather more
intelligently constructed than are most
imported musicomedies, and its Austra-
lian flavor is strong and unmistakable.
Gladys Moncrieff’s pleasant voice is at
the disposal of Mary Collits; George
Wallace and John Dobbie provide
chuckles by the dozen, and Robert
Chisholm and Claude Flemming keep the
plot alive as a gallant officer and a gal-
lant bushranger respectively. Most
popular vocal number on the opening
night was “Australia,” and the best spec-
tacular feature an abo. ballet, as effec-
tive in its way as the totem dance in
“Rose Marie.” The rotating stage not
only obviates scene-shifting delays but
gives continuity of action. Soon no
modern theatre will be without one.
“Collits’ Inn” promises to be no less
successful in Sydney than it was in Mel-
bourne.
* * #
“Elijah,” conducted by Sir Hamilton
Harty at Sydney Town Hall, was more
commendable as an orchestral than as a
choral performance. The choir was not
completely dominated by the conductor;
the band was. The dramatic character
of the music was well realised, however.
Laelia Finneberg, as principal soloist,
showed to less advantage than on former
appearances. Her voice is a trifle light
for oratorio. Walter Kingsley’s Elijah
was impressive, and Evelyn Hall and
Lionello Cecil were adequate to their
respective tasks.
* * *
Sir Jlamilton Harty’s farewell to Syd-
ney was said at the Town Hall on Fri-
day night in a recital of which Wag-
nerian music—“ Ride of the Valkyries,”
“Tannhauser” overture, prelude and
finale , from “Tristan and Isolde,” “Sieg-
fried’s Death March” and “Forest
Murmurs”—provided the backbone.
Cesar Franck’s D Minor Symphony was
another notable item. At a late hour
the conductor announced that the “Walk
to Paradise Gardens” would be given as
a final encore, but that those who had
trains to catch could go before it started.
Nobody stirred. Sir Hamilton glowed
with pleasure, and the audience had a
feeling that it had risen to the oppor-
tunity of paying a pretty compliment to
the conductor who has given Sydney
such pleasure.
*
Those who heard Austral for the first
time at the grand finale on Saturday at
the Melb. Town Hall doubtless went
away satisfied, but samplers, of the ear-
lier concerts were uneasily , aware that a
glorious singer was fighting two antagon-
ists —a most exacting programme and an
overtaxed throat. In one of the last
items she stopped, explained that she
could not finish and substituted another.
Taking the season as a whole, however,
it is doubtful if Melbourne has ever
been treated to a finer display of the
art of the dramatic soprano. Next
month Austral returns to sing in two
speciality symphonic concerts. In the
meantime, the entourage, includ-
ing Amadio, Lambert and a
tuner, will invade 20 rural centres
in a touring car, accompanied by
a caravan bearing a grand piano.
* * *
Dorothy Hutchison, a dark-
haired Melbourne damsel who
was with Pavlova for a space,
provided a programme of mixed
items and varying merit at the
Garrick last week. Her own
dancing belongs to the orthodox
school, but is none the worse
for that. Dancing resembles
architecture in that it depends for
its effects, not on resemblances to
natural phenomena, but on the
perfection with which it over-
comes problems of balance, poise,
movement and arrest in space and
time. Miss Hutchison fulfilled
this specification admirably in all
but a few of her turns, but in
some the beholder was made to
hold his breath with fear lest the
thing would not just come off.
However, the evening passed
without serious mishap. A Papil-
lon to the music of Kreisler
was the best. A group of Chopin dances
brought out a ballet arranged by
Madame Saronova, and Phil Marks was
the local Novikoff who clapped a pair
of magnificent thighs right skilfully.
* H- H-
“The Mocking Bird,” produced by the
Sydney Players’ Club at St. James’s Hall,
is by Lionel Hale, whose “She Passed
Through Lorraine” was staged recently
by the same group. It deals with an
escaped prisoner who falls among a
household of supposedly reputable
citizens, and reveals them as a collection
of shams and rogues. Cedric Kempson,
as the. fugitive, was full of zest and con-
fidence. As Nina Champion, an artist’s
daughter, Mary Hickey was thoroughly
at home. John Gaden was a little incon-
sistent as the clergyman.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Dick the Driller”: The question as
!o whether snakes burrow their own holes
(B. 13/6/’34) is not likely to be settled by
slapdash bush naturalists who are too
tired for scientific field research and con-
fine themselves to wild surmises in the
papers. The best-known of the burrowing
snakes is Elaps centrifugalis. It frequents
the sandy ridges on which bush pubs are
usually built. It has a hard spine on the
end of the tail and, erecting itself on this,
spins rapidly on its axis, with the result
that it sinks its shaft in no time. Many
other species of snake are less industrious.
These are accustomed to requisitioning
the services of E.c., the latter’s fee being
paid in frogs, a point on which it always
insists. That is why it is rarely found at
any distance from waterholes, again a
usual accompaniment of bush pubs.
* * * *
“John Richards”: Plagues of grass-
hoppers have been reported from the
centre of the continent, locusts from the
north; here at Port Hedland (W.A.) we
have a plague of frogs. Torrential rains
recently caused the formation of a five-
million gallon lake. Very soon hundreds
of thousands of frogs, from an inch to
an inch and a half long, started hopping
out of this. They invaded in hundreds
“Now, if you’re good boys and suck up all your slops, maybe some day you’ll
be talkie stars like them.”
the homes of the townspeople. Nobody
escaped ; wherever you went you saw,
felt and heard frogs. Even up the top of
a lighthouse tower, approximately 50ft.
high, they were found. Dry easterly
winds made the frogs seek damper quar-
ters, and a rush was made for ringside
seats around the insides of the tanks.
So far most of them are hale and hearty,
but one wonders what is going to happen
when they die.

being ; these noisy gatherers of eucalyp-
tus berries have cleared the leaves from
many of the gutterings, which now pro-
vide them with handy drinking troughs.

“Python”: In spite of all authorities,
including “Herpeton” (B. 18/4/’34), I say
a snake can eject food which it has com-
menced to swallow. Have seen several
instances of grass-snakes throwing out
small lizards when disturbed. During
’2O half a dozen of us bailed up a 10ft.
carpet-snake in the old weaner-yards on
Moonah Creek, Walgra station (Q.). This
fellow had a rabbit half-down his throat.
He had got as far as the thing’s hips
and his neck was swollen and glistening
with its tension. Poked with a stick, he
spat the half-swallowed rabbit out as
neatly and as quickly as “Dai R.” would
eject a tainted oyster.

“Tom Willie”: Between spells of
grumbling about the weather on Monaro
(N.S.W.), the only truthful member of
the party (myself) earned sneers by re-
porting that he had seen a black snake
sheltering from the cold westerly behind
a messmate log. Bill, who was de-
pendent on me for cigarette-papers,
said he had killed a black snake
one June in the snow. He offered
to show proof. In the pouring rain we
walked three miles to his hut and saw
the record scratched into a plank near
the fireplace. Don’t know whether winter
stupefies them before they are able to
bury themselves, but snakes are often
found in the snow on Monaro.

“Airline”: “Mho’s” willy-willy was
well off its course (B. 4/4/’34). It is un-
usual to encounter these windstorms as
far south as the Speck. The most spec-
tacular and unexpected one I ever wit-
nessed found me on the low ridges
of the Everard Ranges (S.A.), a few
miles north of the Minerby opalfield.
It was raging hot, without a breath of
wind, when, with an earsplitting report,
about a quarter of an acre of mulga van-
ished skywards in a churning cloud of
dust. There was no warning whatever,
and from my point of vantage it was
obvious that the disturbance had struck
vertically.
* * * *
“F.Y.7”: That Gordon setter which
sets snakes (B. 13/6/’34) recalls a fox-
terrier writer owned on a Barcoo station
in the days when Tom Mcllwraith was
consul. Whisky by name, he accounted
for many crawlers, but lived long and
died an honorable death by a merciful
bullet. Though the apple of the family
eye, whenever he bagged a snake his life
became a burden to him for hours after.
Only treatment for snake-bite those days
was to fill the patient with whisky and
keep him moving. It was impossible to
tell whether Whisky had been bitten
after one of his turn-ups, but we took
no chances. He rejected the liquor with
biting invective on the only occasion we
tried to administer it. After that we
confined ourselves to keeping him on the
move for hours, the junior members of
the family taking turns. Every attempt
on his part to snatch a few moments of
"Struth, she’s wearin’ winkers!"
snooze was followed by a mobilisation
of the nursery, and he was urged on his
unending round again until it was certain
all was well.
* * * *
“Uncle Ben”: Was interested in that
simple way of catching crows on a sheep-
skin (B. 23/5/’34). There’s another way.
When you see a crow on a stump, get it
looking you in the eye, then walk round
and round. It can’t take its eye off you,
and eventually screws its neck.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: It doesn’t matter much who
invented the canvas water-bag ; what is
wanted is something that
is proof against the dry
winds. I rode out from a
western N.S.W. station
one morning with a full
bag under the horse’s
neck, and when I got off
for a drink miles out on
the run the bag was
empty. A hot wind, keep-
ing the outside of the bag
dry, had caused the eva-
poration. That sort of
thing has brought about
many a tragedy, the vic-
tim discovering too late
that the winds had sucked
the last sup. The west-
erner’s water-bag usually
has a thick leather pad on
the side that rests against
the horse’s chest; when
not protected in that way
the water isn’t as cool as
it should be, and has a
salty taste. But the out-
side is bare to the wind.
Perhaps if another bag,
made of tanned kangaroo-
skin with the hair on,
were slipped over the canvas, it would
answer the purpose.
“Ibn el Issar”: Anniversary of the
death of Mahomet last week reminds me
that he was about the only founder of a
religion who admitted animals to his para-
dise. The favored ones numbered seven.
They are: The Dove which nested outside
the cave in which he hid when fleeing
from Mecca and deluded his pursuers into
believing that no human could be there ;
El Kaswah, the female camel whose speed
and staunchness bore him safe to Medina ;
Barak, the mare on which he ascended to
heaven ; Baalam’s Ass ; the Dog of the
Seven Sleepers ; the Ant which Solomon
extolled for its industry ; and Jonah’s
Whale.

“Emel”: Scarcity of bush blossom in the
past summer affected Vic. orchardists as
well as apiarists. Parrots, unable to feast
among the flowering eucalypts, attacked
the apples. Green-skinned varieties were
safe, but among the red-skinned, even
though far from ripe, they worked havoc.
The ground beneath such trees looked
like the door of a church after a wedding.
* * * *
“D.E.” (B. 30/5/’34) began it. What
were the birds that Bernhardt saw?
“Stock Inspector”: Galahs undoubtedly,
and I daresay the “prairie” was in the Southern
Riverina. Between Uardry station and the
Galah (aptly named) these rose-breasted cocka-
toos would rise in thousands. Occasionally
when they flew low they obscured the
horizon.
“Kia-Ora”: Sarah’s birds were galahs. I
won’t vouch for their filling the sky, but they
certainly present a magnificent spectacle, occa-
sionally seen on the banks of the Macquarie
River, as, perched on a dead tree in hun-
dreds, they convert its bare branches into a
delicate pink mass.
“Eggsact”: The birds which so impressed
Bernhardt must have been galahs; but farmers
in the mid-north of South Aus. don’t echo
her transports. In seeding time enormous
flocks of galahs make havoc of the early crops.
While they are feeding several birds act as
look-outs. At the least sign of approaching
danger these sentinels give the word, and up
they go, uttering loud, shrill cries. It is when
they bank to circle round the feeding grounds
that the delicate rose-pink of their under-parts
—throat, breast, tail and wings—is dazzlingly
revealed.
“N.C.D.”: Obviously “D.E.” has never
been in western N. S. Wales and seen the
glowing beauty of the pink-breasted galahs as
they rise from the ground in their tens of
thousands. It is a familiar sight in the
Bourke and Brewarrina districts, and also in
a lesser degree in the north-west. Another
most beautiful sight is the polished emerald-
green of a flock of budgerigars as they rise
from their feeding grounds in the early morning.
“A.R.”: Australians who have witnessed the
flaming loveliness of galahs on the wing take
such spectacles for granted. The birds Bern-
hardt saw may possibly have been gaily-hucd
parrots, but at a distance the plumage of
galahs shows up more brilliantly than the
plumage of parrots.
“O’B.”: “D.E.’s” query might be answered
out Longreach (Q.) way. Periodically the gay
little green-and-yellow lovebirds rise in
thousands on the plains, and their formation
and flight are timed to a minute. They truly
are a brilliant sight.
“Morgan”: I suggest that Sarah saw native
finches. Motoring through the Murray Flats in
mid-January, 1931, we put up great mobs of
these little birds —yellow underneath, with light-
green backs. Allowing a bird to each corner
of a square foot, many of these mobs covered
more than four acres of ground. To my know-
ledge they ranged from Murray Bridge to
Lake Frome.
THE BURNING QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Around the city bars and ’cross the hash
Voices are raised in controversy hot
Concerning whether Larwood’s done his dash
And bodyline its final knock has got.
We nature-lovers do not care a jot;
A vastly more important problem takes
Priority with us. Our Gordian knot
Is whether kookaburras slaughter snakes.
Will Dr. Page and Lyons cease to gnash
Their teeth and ’gainst each other darkly
plot
Before the general election clash?
Will Lang and twitt’ring Scullin ever trot
Again in double harness? Ask me not.
Such trivialities my Muse forsakes.
She finds a more engrossing riddle, what?
In whether laughing jackies swallow snakes.
Is it a hardy myth we needs must smash,
A rank delusion that must go to pot?
Say, is it fact or fable, truth or trash,
The jovial bird descendeth like a shot
On ev’ry serpent that his eye can spot
And deals therewith as hungry men with steaks,
Or war-time Diggers with a “dash-and-dot”?
Do kookaburras really prey on snakes?
What is the Council’s ruling? Will they blot
It out, along with other punctured fakes?
Or vote it proven, fair and square and squat?
Is it beyond dispute or is it rot,
The yarn that kookaburras feed on snakes?

MIDFORD.


“Dr. Watts”: The ingenious German
has been thinking up something new
about the bee which promises to add a
little more variety to the romance of war.
The usual professor has discovered that
bees have pigeons done to a cinder in the
matter of homing instinct and can carry
tiny rolls of writing for a considerable
distance. He suggests that o.ps. in future
wars be equipped with bees, a box of which
would be much handier to cart about
than a basket of homers. The bees would
be released with information for the guns
in the rear when telephone lines had been
cut and the strafing put human runners
out of the question. Several drawbacks
suggest themselves. The insects would
only be workable in summer. Since loud
noises cow them—every bee within miles
crawls under the bed when a thunder-
storm is raging—the deafening thunder
of an old-man bombardment would cer-
tainly put them out of action. Then there
would be the temptation to stop and have
one with another bee at flower patches
encountered on the way back with the
message.
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“Byrk”: Sheep may look stupid, but
I’ve noticed that woollies turned on to
fallow to eat the weeds —black oats, etc.
—will always leave one stalk in each
tussock to seed, thus ensuring a supply
for future germination. Any other Abo-
liar noticed this?
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“Cudgerie”: Mickeries (B. 6/6/’34)
are still common in parts of western
Queensland, but they are generally
known as timbered soaks. The bailing
“Ladies and gents., someone’s weighed in light. There’s sixteen acceptances
and on’y fifteen presents.”
gear, consisting of a weighted pole bal-
anced on a fork, a rod and a bucket, is
called a whip, and is worked like the
spring dolly common on mining fields
for crushing hand-picked stone. Near
Cloncurry I have known one man
to water 300 head of cattle daily during
the heat of summer. The ancient device
was in common use in China and Egypt
long before the birth of Christ.
“W.E.8.”: The other night about ten
o’clock I heard cawing outside, and ran
out, to see a flock of crows flying over-
head. Next night the same thing hap-
pened. I’ve never seen crows abroad at
night in this N.Q. district before. Any-
body ever caught Kelly on a nocturnal
raid?
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“O’B.”: If “Ichua’s” lady'friend (B.
30/ 5/ ’34) had fainted earlier in the piece
her friends could have pried her loose at
once. This has been
proved often in the
caves at the Blue
Mountains (N.S.W.)
when a tourist gets
stuck in a tricky
place. He usually
grows panicky, and
his muscles swell with
strain, but as soon as
he faints, and deflates,
the rest is easy.
¥ ¥ ¥
“M u 1 y a n”: No
creature in the bush
has more difficulty in
getting a standing
drink than the flying-
fox. It picks a place
where there are pro-
jecting snags, a half-
submerged log or a
branch of a tree that
hangs low over the
water. After alight-'
ing on the object, it
works its way down
till it can reach the
water, and afterwards
works its way back
until it is high
enough, with four or
five feet of air space
below, to take off.
When a mob is trying
to breast the bar
simultaneously, or some returning meet
others going down, there’s a noisy dis-
pute for the right-of-way. In N.Q. hun-
dreds of flying-foxes are taken when
drinking by crocodiles.
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“Humpybong”: The fact that two
clients of a two-up school in a Sydney
suburb so entangled themselves in black-
berry bushes in trying to escape a police
raid that they had to be treated at a
hospital for injuries reminds me of a
happening during the Easter sailing car-
nival in Moreton Bay (Q.) years ago.
The closing night was celebrated in royal
fashion on Sandgate beach with bon-
fires and beer. One of our number be-
came so exhilarated that, after spending
half the evening trying to jump over the
bonfires and falling into most of them,
he took a flying leap .into a patch of
prickly pear. He was hauled out look-
ing like nothing so much as a grizzly
bear which had just had a haircut, since
he was wearing shorts. Getting the
spines out was a problem. Burning them
off with firesticks led to violent protests
from the patient. Picking them out by
hand was not to be thought of. Finally
someone had the brilliant idea of getting
a huge roll of what was known in those
days as diachylum plaster. This was
warmed at the fires and carefully pasted
on the sufferer. When it had cooled, each
section was pulled off, bringing all the
spines with it. Since d.p. sticketh
something closer than a brother, pulling
the stuff off was greeted by our hairy
patient with blasphemous ingratitude.
However, we warmed to our task, and
“What d’you mean when you say you’ve been double-crossed?”
“I’ve just been jilted by the Siamese Twins.”
half a dozen held him down until the
cure was complete. He never thanked
us for sending him home to the wife of
his bosom more like a human being than
a fretful porcupine, and nowadays, when-
ever I meet him, his greeting conveys the
sense of sullen dislike always exhibited
by those to whom one has done an un-
solicited good turn —or a solicited one,
for that matter.
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“W.P.T.”: An experienced bushman
will never put dogwood on his fire; the
smell is vile. Still, that of a crushed wattle
seed is worse. I trod on one on a damp
rock, and for hours after I blamed the dog
for rolling in something dead. At a little
dance-hall on N.S.W. South Coast a
couple of hobbledehoys dropped seeds
around the hall. In a few minutes all
the dancers were taking fresh air; they
remained outside until a bushman located
the trouble. Another evil-smelling plant
is the wild damson of N.Q. The fruit
is delicious, but the smell of the tree (it
can be detected half a mile away on a
damp day) drives all thought of eating
away.
“Akeake”: “Cachalot” (B.
30/5/’34) is too dogmatic.
The toothed sperm whale
(which, incidentally, usually
averages 70ft. and has never
been known to exceed 84ft.) is
more than a match for the
killer, principally because of
his ability to “sound” deep and
to remain down for a long
time. But a pack of killers
will attack him, particularly if
he gets into shallow waters,
and there is any number of
records to prove it. As for
toothless humpbacks, fins,
blues and southern rights, the
powerful killers flash 20ft. or
30ft. out of the water and
crash down on their victim’s
body until he is exhausted. As
he lies on the surface with his
huge mouth gaping, the pack
launches itself at the vulner-
able tongue mass; and it’s good-night
for the whale.
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“Lanus”: Stalled at the boundary
fence last summer I came across a new
kind of goanna. It was about lOin. long,
nigger brown in color, and, instead of
the usual flat, shiny scales, it had a
knobbly covering exactly like that of a
pine cone. The head was very wide at
the back and triangular in shape. Having
no means of preserving the beast, I had
to leave him. Had never seen his like
before.
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“G.R.R.S.”: On a backwater of the
Lambo River at Bruthen (Vic.) hundreds
of swans and other water-birds swarm.
On June 3 two pelicans settled there.
Next day only one was to be seen ; the
other was found dead on the bank of the
lagoon with a mussel clamped over the
end of its bill. Although Mr. Pelican
had battered his bill until it was broken
and bloodstained, he couldn’t shake the
mussel off. He died of starvation.
¥¥* ' ¥
“Erua”: No Maoriland surfer ever
worries about sharks. There are beaches
common to all the country where one
may wade out several hundred yards
in an even depth of water, and
thousands do. Even in the Bay of
Islands, where launches pass hourly
with enormous mako sharks or hammer-
heads strapped to the hull, bathers are
unperturbed. Shark attacks in M.L. have
been few. An Auckland citizen lost a
leg in the harbor many years ago, and
St. Clair, Dunedin’s surf beach, has one
fatality to its discredit. “New Zealand
Jack,” a famous “tame” shark of the
early days, accounted for a child in Wel-
lington Harbor.
“Travel Stain”: I learn from Black
Brother once how to live a bit longer.
Digging out orchids in the dense scrub
back of Herberton (N.Q.) we lost touch
with social life and wandered away from
water. That became serious to me,
although brother Binghi didn’t seem to
care. At last, however, he concluded
that I needed a refresher, so he took my
tomahawk and chopped down a scrub
palm, hacked off the top and gave me the
milk-like pith to chew. I wasn’t troubled
after that.
* * ¥ ¥
“Alex.”: Kites are used by the natives
of Samarai (Papua) to catch long-toms
—game fish which abound there. The
kite, lightly constructed of palm leaves,
is flown from a canoe so that a tuft of
cobwebs attached by a string to its tail
is made to skip upon the wavetops like
a flying-fish. The long-tom, which fancies
flying-fish, snaps at the lure and entangles
its long teeth in the fluff.
* ' * ¥ *
“Yarragundry”: Snarer’s” cyanidingi
efforts (B. 30/5/’34) were hailed with
derision in the best cyaniding circles. A
disreputable acquaintance of mine whom I
have had to bail out on several occasions
gave me the up-to-date method. Raisins
are split, cyanide is inserted, and the
whole is coated with hot beeswax to
render the bait waterproof. A tack
affixes the raisin to the tree, it is incon-
spicuous, and baits not taken are gath-
ered up and used indefinitely.
¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
“Trinity”: Queer fish are the skippers
and the skip-jacks of Trinity Bay (N.Q.)
and the seas adjacent. The small skippers
stay or are left on the mud when the
tide goes out, breathing air and using
their fins like flippers to make back to
the sea. They can spend an hour in the
air without discomfort. In this they
resemble the lung-fish of the Mary and
Burnett rivers. The skip-jack is larger
than the skipper, about the size of a
flying-fish, for which it is often mistaken
when it breaks from the water and sails
along on the surface. But the skip-jack
doesn’t fly—he motors, using his tail as
a propeller. This is the only part of him
that is in the water, and it must vibrate
at an astonishing rate to carry the fish
along at such high speed.
THE PASSING OF THE YEAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There came an elfin summons o’er the hills at
break of day,
A sound as of a silver fife blown faintly, far
away;
And the waving grasses listened, and the care-
less insects heard,
And the message came to each bush bird.
And from the south, as at the call, there blew
a chilly wind
That cried “O Sun, be on your way, for
winter is behind,”
And the dancing grasses shivered, and the
insects paused in fear,
And the birds fell silent, far and near.
The swallow and the winterfiack are headed
for the north;
Beneath the red and golden leaves new buds
are peeping forth;
Gone are the darting butterflies that frolicked
with the grass,
And the last warm winds of autumn pass.
So stoke the fire, and fill the bowl, and let the
winter come!
From it we fear no mortal hurt, what though
our hands be numb.
Its reign, though boisterous, is short, and soon
the woods shall ring
With the first clear clarion of spring.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
DRAFTING-GATE CLASSING.
“Murrawong”: The age at which a
sheep ceases to be profitable varies in
different districts, and depends also on
whether the animal is used purely for
wool or as a dual-purpose animal. It
should be fairly evident that scraggy old
“rosellas,” bare on points and bellies, and
cutting only a hatful of short, thin wool,
are not worth their keep, yet hundreds
of graziers leave the culling for age to
Nature, unmindful of the fact that, if they
had got rid of the aged sheep earlier, they
would have more grass in the dry spell,
especially around waterholes where the
old ewes are to be found.
In some districts before a sheep reaches
five years the wool begins to show signs
of running out. The britch and neck
folds are the first places to be affected,
but the trouble quickly extends. The
wool loses its crimp and runs straight
and doggy, .taking on a hard, stary
appearance. The breeding of the animal
has a lot to do with this early degenera-
tion. Some strains are noted for it, and
fine-woolled sheep are affected equally
with the stronger qualities. The local
origin of the trouble may be found
among the rams and checked to a cer-
tain extent by culling all harsh-handling,
stary, wiry-fleeced sheep. Scores of men
excuse such rams on the ground that,
although the sire’s fleece is undoubtedly
run-out and faulty, he still gets good
lambs. Certainly he may, and they may
be good hoggets, too, but the fleeces of
his progeny will start to deteriorate while
other sheep of the same drop are still
growing good-quality wool.
Certainly all aged sheep should be
shorn as a separate flock and not mixed
with the younger sheep. The classer may
be able to keep the short and doggy
fleeces out, but the piece-pickers cannot
be expected to do so. The result is a
good line of broken or pieces spoiled by
the inclusion of short, thin and doggy
wool. One of the shrewdest sheepmen
I ever met used to declare that he did
most of his wool-classing with the draft-
ing-gate, and his advice could be gener-
ally followed with advantage.
BULL MITCHELL AND SHEEP.
“Haddington”: Despite “J.R.D.” (B.
30/5/’34), “bull Mitchell” is excellent
sheep feed. I have one paddock 10,000
acres, which carried 9000 wethers from
December to April. Now the feed is dry,
it is stocked with about 4500 ewes and
lambs ready to wean. They are as fat
as seals. About three-quarters of the
paddock is under bull Mitchell. In my
opinion, bull Mitchell grass and its seed
is easily the best feed we have, although
we possess curly Mitchell, Flinders,
button and various others. It is my ex-
perience on the N.Q. downs that sheep
do better in big paddocks than in small
ones, provided the country is well
watered. All stock like to change their
beats, and big paddocks save the trouble
of shifting them.
About March this year, blowflies were
bad, but we had no trouble at all. The
only reason I can think of why that
should have been is that our sheep had
more exercise and were healthier in pad-
docks of from 10,000 to 17,000 acres.
SHOW-FLOOR SURPRISES.
“Doubleyouay”: Strange how wool
opens up! I notice the following, and
wonder if others agree. A line on the
show floor looks more even m lengm
than in the bin, also finer. Broad 64’s in
with 60’s for safety look out of place ;
the shorter, bright, light fleeces you
“pushed” match all right.
Again, the very deep-stapled seems to
shrink, while the cobwebby stuff stretches.
In sheds I’ve found wool so shafty it
looked too long for its quality—but on the
floor it looks right; I’ve made lines that
seemingly had no length at all in the
bin, but they’ve got it when the bale is
opened.
’Ware fatty and yellow fleeces; they
catch you every time. Buyers drag them
out and put them on top of the bale.
They look like stones. But in lines they
look better, especially the yellows, which
become near-white. Lack of contrast,
presumably. Put wool where it fits!
Repacked wool, nice in the dealer’s
store, opens up bedraggled and without
bloom.
An odd sweat insults a clean line of
pieces more than all the sweats in an
all-in job.
Wool from a loose-soil district ( e.g
Gascoyne, W.A.) is brighter in the bin
than that from hard stony ground (e.g.,
Murchison, W.A.) on the floor. The
bigger dusty tip of the first is doubtless
responsible.
WOOL TYPES.
“Kai Te Pai”: I differ from “Dead
Finish” (B. 16/5/’34) about wool types.
He assumes that the depression was
responsible for the broadening of the
types and producing heavier and
lengthier staple.
From close observation I have no hesi-
tation in saying that the damage to the
fine-wool industry of Australia occurred
during the period of peak prices. One of
the greatest curses in any country is the
dealer whose only god is profit, and to
him must be apportioned a fair share
of the blame. The pastoralist has an
incentive to improve his stock ; the dealer
doesn’t need to care. Margin is all he
has to worry about.
When clips as much like hair as wool
brought fabulous prices there was a
general slackening in the improvement of
the flocks, and many growers excused
their lapse by saying the coarser type
had greater utility value.
The keenest sheepmen I have met are
to be found in the West Darling, where
they battle under greater disabilities than
on the safe inside country. A large pro-
portion of the owners up till 1930 em-
ployed a sheep-classer. One owner I
know aimed for a flock of sound-con-
stitutioned, large-framed sheep carrying
a fleece round about a 72 count. He
had 1500 ewes up to that standard, and
this year his clip has averaged 121 b.
Generally speaking, the finer the wool
the weaker the constitution (this is most
noticeable after a drought), but it is the
duty of breeders to overcome this. Fme-
wool supremacy is a matter of national
concern. Ought there to be organised
supervision in the mating of sheep?
When you hear men boasting about
never having paid more than a guinea
for a ram it seems reasonable that such
fools should be “separated from their
folly.”
LARGE WHITES V. OTHER BREEDS.
“Whakatu”: I must say “Kirby” on
pigs (B. 17/4/’35), knows what he is talk-
ing about. Having killed pigs for curing
all my life, for export and otherwise (L
handle personally thousands every year),
I know that English preference is not for
the Large White. The pigs which have
been topping the English markets are
Tamworth-Berkshire crosses. The first
three shipments from the Hawke’s Bay
works realised 7+d. per pound, plus 25
p.c. exchange. When the market dropped
to s|d. pigs of this breed realised 6.9
pence per pound, plus 25 p.c. They were
competing with the Large Whites.
The Large White is being pushed on
the farmers of Maoriland. It is all
right from a killing point of view lor
porkers to 851 b. or 901 b. After that they
start to grow and do not come into their
own until they reach the 1601 b. or 1701 b.
mark. As “Kirby” says, baconers for
the export trade should be between 1151 b.
to 1401 b.; the Whites are wanting in
light weights of that standard. They
have a good flitch, and that is all
to them, except that when they or their
crosses meet their fate at the hands of
unskilled men or methods, their blemishes
can be partly removed with the knife.
Not so the Tamworth or Berkshire or
the Berkshire-Tamworth cross. When
these pigs are badly killed they show it.
The most valuable parts of a pig
(especially a bacon pig) are the flitch and
hams. No other pigs carry the hams of
the Berkshire, and the Tamworth can
compete with the world for length of
side.
Large Whites are prone to sunburn
and show the marks of fighting very
easily.
HANDLING WEANERS.
“Poddy Dodger”: Weaners —cattle,
sheep and horses —need opposite handling
from that given to older stock. Old
’uns should never be kept in the yards a
minute longer than need be. Weaners
must be kept there till they’re hungry
and thirsty enough to make their thoughts
leave mother. With calves it is at times
advisable to break the rule of not keep-
ing stock two nights in the yard. It
might be necessary to keep those little
fellows that long to bring them to a
proper frame of mind for handling on the
track.
A rule with older stock is that the
lead should be steadied for the tail. That
is reversed with weaners. The tail must
keep up with the lead. It is fatal to
try to hold the lead for the tail. They
might be steadied ever so slightly ; but
when they show an inclination to split,
they must go in a body and the tail must
pace it with the leaders. The first wean-
ing road rule is “Hold them in a mob.
Don’t let them spread.”
If weaners spread, the men handling
them might as well go home and play
marbles. They have only a celluloid
dog’s chance of putting them together
again while they are running. Weaners
have never been taught to turn. They
drive straight ahead in an effort to race
away from the man who is guiding them.
Till they have been taught to turn it is
much easier to handle them as one.
The danger is, when they are racing,
that the leaders might strike a gully. If
one leader stumbles and falls the others
will pile on him, making a devil of a
mess.
(Continued on page 24.)
BEATING THE RABBIT.
“Valerin”: Under favorable conditions
“Granova’s” claim (B. 6/6/’34) that fumi-
gation is a cheap and effective method
of dealing with rabbits holds good. In
small netted paddocks, where burrows
are not too big and rabbits plentiful, a
couple of men with dogs can clean up.
Where rabbits have got a good hold
fumigating is not a success. The diffi-
culty is to get the fumigant into pockets
and dead-ends in the larger warrens. Gas
issuing from the openings ■is no proof
that it is penetrating into all recesses.
Another problem is to control loose
rabbits which at night open up the closed
burrows.
To get satisfactory results it is neces-
sary to go over the area several times,
which makes the process costly.
I have seen country fumigated until a
rabbit could not be seen. A few days
later they were there again.
As an adjunct to decoy poisoning,
fumigation is of undoubted value in mop-
ping up,strays. And on sandhills, where
rabbits burrow down 20 feet, a tank-
plow, followed by fumigators as soon as
any openings show, gets the best results.
“Pick”: When every other measure
against the rabbit failed on Billilingra.
Currandooley, Manaar and Gidleigh, of
the Southern Tableland of N.S.W., the
owners wire-netted their rabbits in and
then dug them out within the enclosure.
The success of that plan induced all the
landowners of the region to follow suit.
Gradually the freezing works and can-
ning factories ceased operations. They
stand now as monuments of a dead in-
dustry. Where the bunnies once swarmed
in myriads not one is now to be found.
BREEDING AND PRODUCTION.
“C.P.”: “W.D.McC.” (B. 6/6/’34) is
side-stepping. Production and percent-
age of butter-fat are two different things.
In B. 16/5/’34 I distinctly stated
that butter-fat percentage was derived
from breeding. Had “W.D.McC.” taken
the trouble to read further he would
have seen the following:
But as the Friesian and Ayrshire give
much more milk there may not be so much
difference in the total butter-fat per cow.
If the farmer can grow his balanced
ration on his farm so much the better,
as long as it does not cost him too much.
Most farmers cannot do this at all times,
and some buy concentrates. The great
secret is to know what to buy.
I remember one using maizemeal at
£lO per ton to balance up his ration
when he really wanted a high-protein
concentrate, which he could have bought
for not more than £B. When he finally
did this his cows responded at once.
“W.D.McC.’s” statement that the best
fat producers in the Old Country are
the Scottish Ayshires has nothing to do
with the subject, even if it were true.
Neither has his reference to Mr. W.
Gunn’s 190 Ayrshires.
On that ideal farm of “W.D.McC.’s,
instead of the ton of hay in reserve
being oaten I should much prefer it to be
lucerne.
The rest of his remarks are sound
enough, though why he should have
missed lucerne is rather remarkable, as
this is the king of all fodders for balanc-
ing a ration, and, with, good rainfalls,
stands alone as the dairyman’s best
friend.
DEALING WITH WEEVILS.
“Ceres”: The first essential in protect-
ing matured and well-dried grain from
weevil infestation is a systematic clean-
up. Waste grain must be burnt; walls
and floors of barns in which grain has
been, even temporarily, stored must be
swept and sprayed with kerosene. Second-
hand bags must be brushed thoroughly
inside, dipped in boiling water and dried,
and any machinery given the once-over.

S. H. PRIOR MEMORIAL PRIZE
To recognise the services to Australian literature of the late Samuel
Henry Prior, editor of “The Bulletin” for 18 years, his son, H. K. Prior,
has provided £lOO per annum for a prize, to be known as the S. H. Prior
Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work, together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain ail property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.
Any bona-fide Australian resident or any person born in Australia,
New Zealand or British South Pacific islands will be eligible to enter, for
the competition, novels which must be the original work of the entrant and
previously unpublished, either wholly or in part, in book or serial form.
Manuscripts must be submitted under a nom de plume, and the true name and
address of the author must accompany each entry in a sealed envelope, which
will not be opened until the judges have made their decision.
The judges’ selections will be final, and competitors must accept as
binding the trustees’ decisions on other matters arising out of the contest.
The trustees, whose address is 252 George-street, Sydney, reserve the
right to withhold the prize if no novel submitted is, in the opinion of the
judges, worthy of an award.
Grain stored in tightly-fitted bins is
less liable to attack, as there is little varia-
tion in moisture content, and the amount
of carbon dioxide produced by the wheat
is calculated to prevent insect develop-
ment.
Should, however, weevil appear in
grain, fumigation with carbon bisulph.
is recommended. Pour the liquid into a
shallow tray on top of the grain, or on to
the grain itself. If the container is
reasonably gas-tight use four pints to
each 1000-bushels capacity, irrespective
of the amount of grain in the receptacle
being fumigated.
Carbon bisulph. is highly explosive and
inflammable, so keep lights well away
while fumigating.
Bagged wheat in barns is more liable to
be infested than that in bins. Barn floors
should be boarded or concreted, and all
cracks or openings closed to keep rain
out. As a barn is not as gas-tight as a
tank use four times the dosage of carbon
bisulph. as in a silo or tank.
Bagged wheat should be stacked on
the floor, leaving a clear space one foot
wide round the edges.
Grain for seed must not be fumigated
with carbon bisulph. for more than 24
hours, when the silo or tank should be
opened up to allow the fumes to escape.
Before bagging and storing seed wheat
it should be treated with 2oz. of copper
cai'bonate powder per bushel, mixed so
that every grain is finely coated with dust.
Copper carbonate is poisonous and can
only be used for seed.
PROPER CLEARING METHODS.
“J.R.L.”: Ringbarking is often looked
on by forest lovers as a wicked destruc-
tion of timber. It should be simply the
destruction of useless timber. All on my
property are instructed to carefully drag
away all logs and rubbish from under
kurrajong and other fodder trees, so as
to prevent their destruction by fire.
Suckerers carefully preserve all seedling
kurrajongs, thousands of which come up
at the base of the dying ironbarks.
More destruction of good fodder trees
goes on here in Central Queensland in the
(“desert”) forest areas than anywhere I
have seen. In the green-timbered coun-
try the fodder tree chopped off in drought
hasn’t a chance against the eucalypts,
and dies. Fallen timber tends to protect
grass ; it is impossible to eat out most
paddocks covered with fallen timber, as
enough grass always escapes to reseed the
ground. Also the decaying timber pro-
vides a source of fertiliser for the grass
and prevents erosion by water.
With belts of pine, scattered cabbage-
gum, kurrajong, bauhinia and other fodder
trees, and fat sheep instead of poor speci-
mens, properly treated country looks
good compared with the miles of mono-
tonous box and ironbark forest too thick
to carry a decent head of foliage above.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Deekay”: When fencing in clayey
country always put the clay back into
the hole last. Thus grass grows much
less easily near the posts, and much
fencing is saved during bushfire time.
“C.J.S.”: Try this antidote for curly-
leaf on peach- and nectarine-trees, and
black-spot on apricof-trees. Dig in lightly
around each tree about 21b. of slack
lime while trees are bare. When leaf-
buds start to form, dig in 41b. sulphur to
each tree without disturbing the roots.
“A.G.T.”: When a super.-box bottom
plate in a seed-drill loses a corner, try
this: Cut a piece of sheet iron slightly
larger than the hole and make two
double snip cuts on two sides. Adjust
the patch in position in the bottom of
the box, the back edge under the head-
ings that hold the plates. Then bend the
edges of iron between the snip cuts down
and force them up under the plate.
“W.D.McC.”: Tell “Agricola” (B.
6/6/’34) that an old bicycle or motor-
cycle tube will save his horses from chaf-
ing. Cut into suitable lengths, pull over
the chain, and fasten at each end. It
will not get hard with dust and sweat
like the strip of sacking.
t£ “Energetic”: When the cows are
going off” try milking them this way.
Legrope the first cow and start her. She
will only have a few squirts, then a long
wait. Legrope another cow, and start
her. Then go back to the first, and she
will have her milk all ready for you.
• When finished with her legrope another
before sitting down to the second, and
so. on. You will find there is not a
minute wasted waiting.
“A.G.T.”: Broken spokes in machine-
wheels can be avoided by keeping them
drawn up to even tension and the nuts
tight. Fill cavities worn by ruts in the
wood rim with washers, and place an
extra-large washer next to the nut to give
a greater bearing surface.
“Wrash”: A handy tool for digging
up long roots like parsnips or carrots, or
for cleaning out narrow post-holes, can
be made from bedstead angle-iron. To
a foot-length section screw a two-foot
wooden handle. Round off the end with
a file. Bevel and sharpen its edge. Drill
and fit a foot-pressure step through a
bolt at a convenient height.
“Bill R.”: This is a sound pickling
recipe: Cut the meat into convenient
pieces, rub coarse salt thoroughly into
each piece and pile it to drain on a bench
for 24 hours. Arrange the pieces in a
cask. For every 1001 b. of meat pour
over it a pickle of 71b. salt, loz. each of
saltpetre and cayenne pepper, a quart
of treacle and 8 gallons of water. In
three weeks, after washing off all salt,
hang the meat in the sun to dry. Do not
leave it out after sundown.
“Home Vet.”: Include in your first-
aid kit a large-size magnifying-glass and
a small looking-glass to aid in the dress-
ing or cleaning of a wound, or in the
detection of foreign matter. Often a life
depends on proper cleansing. The glass
is also just as good for handling first-aid
cases in the home. Minute splinters can
be quickly fastened on to without any
undue “fossicking” or pain.
“Dowerin”: You can prevent break-
age of the bars of drill harrows by
inserting a length of No. 10 soft wire
in the drag chains. Twist the ends lightly
together. When the bar meets an obstruc-
tion likely to cause damage, the wire
pulls undone.
“Jimrnac”: A Bananaland cheese
factory has put renewed life into the
dairy-farmers of the border mountain
country. Tests disclosed (in that locality)
that milk from cows feeding on the ridge-
grown grass is superior in curd and
carries less whey than milk from cows
pastured on the flats. Consequently, the
cheese manufacturer has arranged to buy
all ridge-fed milk, has built a factory and
has guaranteed a good price.
“0.X.0.”: Whiteness in animals is
associated with softness. This may be all
right in beef cattle, but even there der-
matitis (sun-scald) causes trouble (as it
does in pigs of that color). With horses
it is often noticed that white hooves are
far more liable to sand-crack, cracked
heel and many other hoof maladies than
dark hooves. There is probably some
justification for the old-time breeder’s
saying: “One white hoof, buy him ; two
white hooves, try him; three white
hooves, deny him.”
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Causes of enzoitic pneumonia in calves ?
(2) Treatment? (3) Prevention? —1761.
(1) Pneumonia in calves may be due to either
lung worms or bacteria. It is assumed that you
refer to the latter. The complaint usually fol-
lows white scours, which affect calves up to 10
days. Infection may take place either through
the navel or from dirty feeding utensils and
infected yards. (2) Not economical unless calf
is valuable. After navel infection, it is of no
avail. Starve for 24 hours; then give whole
mother’s milk with (once only each day) one
teaspoonful of commercial formalin till scour-
ing ceases. Once symptoms of pneumonia
are noticed a cure is unlikely. (3) (a) Isolate
sick calves from healthy ones. ( b ) Build new
calf pens, etc., and use these only for healthy
calves, (c) Allow calves to suck the mother for
several days, (d) Feed calves on whole fresh
milk (warm) for at least two weeks, and gradu-
ally change to skim-milk, (e) When the farm
is widely infected, add one cupful of lime-
water and one teaspoonful of formalin to, each
gallon of milk. If constipation ensues, dis-
continue the formalin, (g) Keep all feeding
utensils clean and scald before using. ( h ) See
that cows calve in clean paddock. Ligate navel
cord with piece of string dipped in iodine,
and treat cord stump with iodine.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
VI. — Windjammer Days and Ways.
Before the days of aeroplanes, the only
way of getting to Australia, apart from
arranging to be born there, was by wind-
jammer. Windjammers carried three or
four masts (the first, second, third and
fourth), several acres of canvas, one
skipper, three mates (the jigger, the
spanker and the driver) and a full com-
plement of greenhorns and shellbacks.
The skipper whs always a small, under-
sized man, yet he was invariably capable
of cowing the biggest bully on the ship
with a look. His voice, quiet, yet in-
cisive, was always obeyed without ques-
tion. If he said “Send Yankee Charlie
aft,” Yankee Charlie went aft without
stopping to argue. If he happened to
be aft already when spoken to, that was
just his bad luck.
The mates were hulking brutes who
made life unbearable for the crew.
They were possessed of a mania for
making the vessel look pretty. No
sooner had the men turned in for the
night than the order would be given, “All
hands on deck to trim sail.” It seems
unreasonable that men should be asked
to trim a sail in the middle of a howling
gale. One would think that such jobs
would be more easily performed while
the ship was in port.
But tasks such as this were the daily
lot of the man who shipped before the
mast. If he didn’t like it he could ship
abaft the binnacle or behind the rudder,
or in some other part of the vessel, but
if he shipped before the mast he was
simply asking for it, and deserved all he
got. ■ .
In addition to sail-trimming, a sailor
also had to be able to sing a chanty and
run the easting down. No one nowadays
knows exactly what an easting was, but
any old shellback was capable of run-
ning one down. The chantymen, who
were also known as . “The Roaring
Forties,” were very necessary men in a
windjammer. Their job was to sing the
captain to sleep, and to whistle for wind
when the ship was becalmed. No one
was considered a real sailor until he had
rounded Cape Horn half a dozen times
and was frozen so stiff that he justified
the term “a hardened seadog.” He then
qualified for the dog-watch.

HEBE.
From childhood it had always been
her one ambition to serve in a bar. No-
thing seemed more soul-satisfying to her
than the task of handing out cooling
drinks to thirsty men. Parental opposi-
tion, however, robbed her desire of ful-
filment, and she grew up a dissatisfied
woman, with her ambition unrealised.
For years she
lived in despair,
sullen and dis-
contented. Why
should she waste
her life in uncon-
genial occupa-
tions when the
one career she
longed for was
denied her?
At last the
great idea came
to her. If she
could not dis-
pense drinks in
someone else’s
bar, why not start
a bar of her
own?
Friends spoke
of the evils of
drink, of the dif-
ficulty of procur-
ing a license and
of the power of
vested interests
but she heeded
them not.
Starting in a
small way, she
quickly came to
the forefront of
the trade, and
she now owns
her own herd of
Jerseys and controls over a score of milk
bars in the city and suburbs.

“Ho applied for the position, stating his age
to be 16, but it was later discovered that he
was 18 ."—Brisbane paper.
Reminds me of the family next door.
The kid is seven, except when he travels
by tram or goes to the pictures. Then
he is four. His mother is round about
40, but she tells everybody she’s going
on for 30. The poor old man is the
exception. He’s only 42, but he looks
every bit of 60.

THE VICTIM.
The dying man looked up at his com-
forter. “Yes,” he sighed, “I’ve had my
cross to bear —been dogged with ill-
health all my life. First I had a nervous
breakdown through worrying over some
horrible pains in my stomach. 1 knew it
was cancer, but the doctor said it was
beer,
“I’d never shave, for fear of anthrax,
and I’m sure 1 had a floating kidney. At
times the thing’d get tangled in my wind-
pipe and almost choke me. My lum-
bago and indigestion nearly drove me
mad. I had varicose veins as big as the
high-pressure tunnel, and my blood pres-
sure must have been 1001 b. to the
square inch.
“All the time the doctor would do
nothing for me. Said I was all right. 1
turned to whisky for comfort, and got
the horrors. Went to the quack again
yesterday and he said suddenly, snap-
pish-like :
“ ‘What’s wrong with you, my man, is
that you’re a victim to hypochondria.’
Didn’t even break it gently. I turned
white; then I laughed hard and scorn-
fully.
“‘A fine sort of doctor you are,’ I
said. ‘All these years you’ve been say-
ing there’s nothing wrong with me, and
now you tell me I’ve got hypochondria.
I suppose I’ve had it all along, and you
were too dumb to see it.’
“He laughed callously, and I gave him
a reproachful look and staggered out, a
broken man. Then by an act of Pro-
vidence I was knocked over by a tram.
“Too right, I’ve had my cross.”
Sregor.

IN MEMORIAM.
Though I’m an absent-minded fool

And overcome with grief;
Absorbed indeed in deep remorse
I sent myself a wreath !

(1) What is the tennis rule regarding a player
who reaches across the net and strikes the
ball in play with his racquet, returning it be-
fore it has crossed the net ? (2) In the
case of a “screwed” lob which lands in his
court and bounces back over net into striker’s
court —if receiver’s racquet touches ball before
landing back, but in doing so crosses net, who
gets the benefit of the point 3 —2005.
(1) A player may not reach over the net to
play a ball unless it be a ball that has already
crossed the net, bounced on his side of it and,
owing to excessive spin, bounced back again
on to his opponent’s side. He is then entitled
to reach across and touch the ball with his
racquet. So long as he does not touch the net
with his racquet, or any part of his body or
person, the return is a good one. (2)
The receiver would win the point whether
his racquet came in contact with the ball while
on his own side of the net or on his opponent’s
side.

What is the position in regard to the taxa-
tion of annuities in Tasmania ? —2036.
Annuities are taxed in full under the Land
and Income Tax Act, no deduction being
allowed where annuities have been purchased
in respect of return of capital or any other
item (Sec. 54, vii). Annuities are taxed at
property rates, except where it is clear that
they are payable out of income from business
sources.
What is the income-tax rate in the Northern
Territory, statutory exemption and deductions
allowed ? —2029.
' A statutory exemption of £2OO is allowed
to all taxpayers other than companies and
absentees. Where income is derived from both
personal exertion and property the deduction
is made first from property income, and excess
(if any) is allowed against personal-exertion
income. Rates are: Personal exertion, 4|d. in
the £1 up to £BOO, 7d. in the £1 over £800;
property, 9d. in the £1 up to £BOO, 13id. in the
£1 over £BOO. Company rate is the same as
for individuals. Concessional deductions, i.e.,
children, medical expenses, life assurance, super-
annuation, gifts, etc., are identical with Federal
scale.

What are angel sharks, and are many species
to be found in Australian waters? —2033.
Sometimes called monk-fish, these are mem-
bers of the family Squatinidce, a group tran-
sitional between sharks and rays. The Body is
depressed and flat like that of a ray, and the
greatly enlarged pectoral fins form an imperfect
disk; but they are separated from the head,
instead of being united with it as in rays.
Further, the gill-openings are on the side of the
neck, as in sharks, instead of on the lower
surface. The commonest Australian form is
Squatina australis, which occurs in shallow
waters south of the tropics, and attains a
length of live feet. Another Australian species,
S. tergocellata, is known from a single small
specimen trawled in deep water in the Great
Australian Bight.
During 1917 and 1918 investigations were
made at the Sydney Technical College by Profes-
sor H. G. Chapman with the object of obtain-
ing “races” of yeast that would produce more
rapid ripening of dough in breadmaking. I
understand that he was successful. Can you
give me (1) a brief description of the Chapman
method of growing yeast and (2) its advantages
over the older methods ? —1429.
(1) In the “Australian Encyclopaedia” Prof.
Chapman described his method: One ounce
of hops was placed in about three quarts of water
in an enamel bucket, and the mixture boiled 20
mins.; the liquid was then strained off. When
the temperature had fallen to somewhat above
155 deg. Fahr., 21b. of crushed malt and
of flour were added to the liquor, and the
mixture was maintained at this temperature
for two to five hours. The wort was
strained from the extracted malt, and its
volume made up with water to just less than
lgal. by filling up to a mark on the bucket;
it was then poured into an enamel stewpan, in
which the gallon formed a layer of about an
inch on the bottom. The stewpan was heated
until the wort boiled vigorously, the lid was
placed on, and the contents allowed to cool.
When the temperature reached 80deg, Fahr.,
yeast from the previous stock was added. This
mixture was beaten for five minutes with an
egg-whisk that had been rinsed in boiling water,
and the heating repeated an hour later. The
yeast then stood for 15 hours in the covered
stewpan, the temperature being maintained at
80deg. Fahr.; when it was uncovered the stock
for the next growing was removed after gentle
agitation of the stewpan to mix the settled
yeast with the liquor. (2) This method of grow-
ing yeast insures it against noticeable contamina-
tion of the wort with moulds or acid-forming
bacteria. The aeration insures more rapid mul-
tiplication, since the rate of multiplication of
yeast-cells in each growing is about 10 times.
Only in this way has it been possible to obtain
a sufficient weight of yeast to ripen the dough
in five or six hours. With less yeast in the
sowing the final weight of yeast per gallon is
less, though the rate of multiplication is faster.
(1) To what family does the shrub known as
Tonga bean, wood, which grows in N.S.W.
coastal areas, belong? (2) What other species
belong to the same family ? —2039.
(1) It belongs to Apocynacece. (2) Principal
members of the species are Alyxia, a small
genus ranging over Malaysia and southern Asia;
A. buxifolia, a low, rigid, seaside shrub
ranging from Westralia to N. S. Wales;
and Wrightia saligna, a small tree found in
Queensland and northern Australia.
(1) Is bore casing made in Australia? (2)
Number employed in Australia in the manufac-
ture of all kinds of piping ?— 2OlB.
(1) No. (2) Cannot say, as pipes are made
of steel, iron, copper and various other metals,
as well as earthenware, and pipe-making is a
branch of many industries.
(1) What are the functions of the Pharmacy
Board of N. S. Wales ? (2) How is the board
appointed ? —2044.
(1) The board administers the Pharmacy
Act, 1897, Poisons Act, 1902, and Police Often-
ces Amendment (Drugs) Act, 1927. Adminis-
tration of the Pharmacy Act involves super-
vision of the registration of apprentices and
pharmacists, conduct of preliminary and final
examinations, and regulation of the practice
of pharmacy generally. Under the Poisons
Act and Police Offences Amendment (Drugs)
Act, the board regulates the sale of poisons,
narcotics and narcotic substances. (2) The
members are eight registered pharmacists, elected
by the whole body of registered pharmacists.
(1) Most successful method of preserving
timber ? (2) Details of the process ? (3) De-
tails of Boucherie’s and Kyan’s processes ?
2099.
(1) Probably that of creosoting. (2) One
method consists of placing the seasoned timber
in an airtight cylinder, exhausting the air and
then admitting the creosoting oil at a tem-
perature of 120 degrees F. and 1701 b. per sq.
in. pressure. After maintaining the pressure
for a short period the oil is removed from
the cylinder and the timber allowed to dry.
(3) Boucherie’s process consists of forcing
copper sulphate along the fibres until the
timber is thoroughly impregnated. It is useful
in preventing dry rot, but if the timber is
exposed to humidity the salt will dissolve
and be carried away. Kyan’s process consists
of injecting mercury into the pores
of the timber. It is effective against dry rot
and, to some extent, against ants and sea
worms.
What is pterygium ? Does it affect the eye-
sight, and how can it be remedied ? —1946.
The term is applied to a triangular fold of
the conjunctiva, or external mucous membrane
of the eye. It extends towards the cornea at
its inner or outer side, and is practically con-
fined to the region not covered by the lids.
The lesion occurs most commonly in elderly
persons, but exposure to weather extremes and
dust particles may start the trouble at any
age after maturity. Although vision is not
materially affected, there are the disfigurement
and interference with movements of the eye.
It can be removed by operation.
What causes warts on hands and legs, and
how can they he removed? —1923.
Though multiple warts are usually attributed
to lime deficiency in the system, little is known
of the actual infective cause. Contagion is
possible from case to case and from one
location to another in the same person, but
the germ or virus has never been isolated.
Unlike simple, isolated warts, which are treated
externally, this type needs internal treatment
for permanent elimination. Take limewater
with milk thrice daily between meals, and
include green vegetables and cereal foods
freely in the diet. Milk of magnesia should
be taken as an aperient each morning. The
larger warts may be treated with a daily appli-
cation of salicylic acid in Cbllodion.
(1) Cause of cramp in the legs ? (2) Pre-
vention and cure ? —lB6B.
(1) Faulty circulation and uric-acid accumu-
lation in the system. In old age a restricted
blood flow and high blood-pressure may be
associated with the complaint. (2) Avoid long
standing and physical extremes, take frequem
aperient salines, and keep the part warm. After
a tepid soda bath at night, massage the affected
limbs upwards with equal parts of methylated
spirits and olive oil. A liniment may be
smeared on occasionally if the trouble persists.
What is the lowest temperature ever artifici-
ally created ? —2096.
At the University of California last year Prof.
W. F. Glaque and D. P. MacDougall devised
means of creating a temperature 459.4 deg. F.
below zero. Since then experimenters in Hol-
land claim to have produced temperatures
within 1-42,500 th of a degree of absolute zero
(491.4 deg. F. below zero).
Is there any matter in space ? If so, how
much does it weigh ?■ —2097.
As nobody has been in interstellar space
exact information is not available. Dr. Edwin
Hubble, of Mount Wilson Observatory, U.S.A.,
published last year a computation that the
matter in space weighs one hundred million
million million millionth of an ounce per
cubic inch. He added that this is five million
million million times less matter than exists
in the most perfect vacuum modern physicists
can produce in the laboratory.
What are (1) the theme, (2) the plot, and (3)
atmosphere as applied to a novel ? (4) Is
“local color” the same as atmosphere ? —2042.
(1) The idea the story is designed to demon-
strate. (2) The sequence of events dramatically
arranged to exemplify the theme, rising to its
climax and verifying itself by the characters
and their reactions to the events. (3) The
mental environment of the characters. (4)
No, it means only the topographical setting of
a story.
What is arrack ? —2140.
A beverage made in the East Indies from
fermented rice, cocoanut juice or other veget-
able substances. At its best it is transparent,
and of the color of straw, and has a peculiar
but agreeable taste and smell. It contains 52
to 54 per cent, of alcohol.
What nations worshipped Baal, and where
did the god stand in their mythology ? —2132.
He was the chief male deity of the Phoeni-
cian and Canaanifish nations. The first peoples
to worship him did so on mountain tops —
Horeb and Sinai were used by the Midianites
and Amalekites respectively, Mt. Peor by the
Moabites, Carmel by the Phoenicians, and Her-
mon by the Canaanites of the jnterior. Baal
stood for the life-giving power of the sun, while
Moloch represented the sun’s destructive in-
fluence. Later both were united under the
name Melkart, who became the supreme
Phoenician deity.
Principle of the Woods dual-power car ?
—2OBB.
The power plant consists of a small gasoline
engine and an electric motor-generator. The
car starts as an electric by a finger-controlled
lever on the steering wheel which connects a
battery to the motor. At any advanced position
of the electric lever the first movement of the
finger-controlled gasoline lever starts the engine.
As this lever is moved forward the car runs
more on gas, until, at a certain point, the
electro-motor ceases to act as a driving force.
At any speed over 6 m.p.h. the electro-motor
may be run as a generator for battery charging.

Here is
New Hope
Indigestion seems to start so simply.
Just a little fulness after meals, perhaps
a little wind rising from the stomach
and a sense of drowsiness and perhaps
slight headaches.
But as the machinery of digestion
breaks down we quickly see the result.
Pain after meals, awful griping, dis-
tressing fulness, sour wind, sallow
spotted complexion, biliousness, bad
taste in the mouth. The acid griping
pains get worse as your indigestion is
neglected and soon you become to
dread gastritis or ulceration of the
stomach. Be warned.
A MEW-PRINCIPLE REMEDY
GIVES QUICK RELIEF
We do most seriously urge those
with even slight symptoms of indiges-
tion to start at once with De Witt’s
Antacid Powder.
Even in the short time it has been
available for the public, the testimony

in many cases, have tried everything to
end their indigestion misery without
success.
Read these few extracts from a host
of letters and you will realise indiges-
tion, no matter how serious, can be
overcome.
Duodenal Ulcers.

might make a song of sorts, but we can’t see
a poem in it J.R.M.: Afraid we can’t de-
tect the humor R.M.: You have a sprightly
touch, but that particular poem has, been
parodied to ribbons... .G.S.: It’s the sort of
glowing verse that should be folded in a cocked
hat and presented in a bouquet—for one

for ordinary consumption... .R.T.8.: You
bank too much on adjectives and participles
and not enough on rhyme aqd metre... .J.H.S.:
My life is like a cataract that rushes
Seething- to a cauldron
Of self-annihilation.
Your verse is that way, t00....A.5.: Metre

“goo-goo curls” anyway? A.D.8.: It
doesn’t get past, although we have read worse
parodies of Tennyson J.C.: You show feel-

that needs improving. Incidentally, get the
idea out of your head that acid comment is
a necessary ingredient of criticism... .C.A. :
“To My Dog” and “The Blind Man and His
Dog” are both certified as good honest dog-
gerel DJ.H.: The grave mood suits you
better than the gay, but you’re still a long way
off print E.R.M.: There’s no need to be
discouraged; anyone who’s written one good
bit of verse may write another. And keep
in mind that a good proportion of
what is rejected is very near the border-line.

A.H.: No value in such homely reflections

F.A.8.: Whether bluecap wrens are polygynous

O’er miles of ground:

able... .E.F.G.: The plot is old, and it wasn't
very good when it was new N.McF.: Not
up to scratch 8.H.: Labored J.H.W.C.:
Good propaganda, but it doesn’t make a
story E.W.: Sorry we can’t give our bless-

it wrong. It was “sea-dog” not “sheep-dog.”
M.J.McN.: The final point is hardly worth
all the trouble... .M.D.S.: Not far off, though
the idea is old H.J.M.: Not very convinc-

the type of yarn wanted A.H.N.: You’ve
deserted your usual style for one that is
forced and humorless... .H.G.: Try it on
Bancks. Would make a good plot for Ginger
Meggs and Min....M.M.: Well, brevity is
always a redeeming feature J.D.S.: Not up
to standard... .F.C.8.: Off our beat....

“Middle Passage”: The “pilot’s two
fingers” (B. 6/6/’34) must have been a
poor second to the “first mate’s nip.”
The old Liverpool tradition about the
latter dates from the days of the West
Coast Trade. When masters and first
mates returned to Liverpool after land-
ing their cargo in the West Indies, the
skipper was taken into the owners’ room
for a glass of wine ; the mate was escorted
by the head clerk to the nearest snuggery,
where convention demanded the special
nip of best Jamaica. This measured four
fingers and a thumb. The thumb was
placed, extended, point downwards on
the table and the four fingers ranged
above it. Mates on the West Coast Trade
had to be exceptionally hefty fellows
with large and capable hands, so it can
be realised that the nip was not one for
weaklings.

“A.H.S.”: With a few Light Horse-
men who were on camel escort in the
Jordan Valley during the battle of Am-
man, I saw a British ’plane brought
down by a single bullet. As it was
well behind our front line, the blame
was laid on an Arab marksman. The
bullet knocked a hole in one cylinder,
breaking the connecting rod, and the
broken rod smashed the timing shaft.
The ’plane was loaded with four bombs
in racks between the wheels; the pilot
dared not risk releasing these, and landed
with them. He tore his undercarriage off,
and the bombs dug a hole in the ground
about a foot deep but didn’t explode,-
though what he said about sniping Arabs
was hot enough to explode anything.

“Plug”: That tribute to the virtues of
the tall silk hat (B. 23/5/’34) reminds me
that a London “Times” of 1797 records
that John Hetherington, “a haberdasher
of the Strand,” was required to find
sureties for £5OO for “a breach of the
peace and inciting to riot.” John’s
offence was that he had invented the silk
hat —described by the watch as having
“a shiily lustre and calculated to frighten
timid people”—and caused the commo-
tion by wearing it in the street. Wit-
nesses swore that several women had
fainted at the sight, children had
screamed and dogs yelped. Further, a
son of cordwainer Thomas was trampled
by the mob and had an arm broken.
John pleaded the Briton’s inalienable
right to wear what headdress he pleased,
but the defence fell on deaf ears.

“Barber-Chirurgeon”: It gives one
pleasure to realise that the medical pro-
fession is returning to the practices of
a century ago, when, if a patient was
brought in with his throat cut, the first
thing to be done was to bleed him. The
principle has been repeated in the latest
development of treatment for asphyxia-
tion ; it consists in administering carbon-
dioxide, deadliest of all asphyxiating
gases. London’s police are now equipped
with a small apparatus enabling them
to administer the gas to the apparently-
drowned and those rescued unconscious
from burning buildings. The gas speeds
up the breathing rate, which means that
the patient absorbs more oxygen than he
would otherwise have done.

A letter from London:
The season opened with a bang and the
waving of Sir Thomas Beecham’s baton. “The
Ring” is being done in its entirety, and Covent
Garden is jambed tight with enthusiasts will-
ing to undergo five hours of Wagner at a sit-
ting. Beecham sugars the pill by an hour off
for dinner, and it’s quite the thing to see
ladies with their escorts in full evening togs
crossing streets like St. James’s in broad day-
light on their way to food. They put the
clock back an hour here, so what is normally
seven is only six by the sun.
On the opening night Beecham told some
chatterers to “shut up,” and everybody is going
about smiling broadly. The little man with the
beard is magnetic.
John Woods has finished his - “Charley’s
Aunt” tour, and has a choice of repertory or
musicomedy. Mary MacGregor has been play-

married Fay Ainsworth) is running rep. at
Windsor and having his actors simply snatched '
from him by West End managements. Marie
Tempest is going strong. Margaret Rawlings

on its bill.

The Steering Column.
FORD V8 COMES THROUGH TEST WITH
FLYING COLORS.
(By FRED BERRY.
Henry Ford, twenty-five years ago, made motoring history
and laid the foundation of a huge personal fortune by building
a car for the man of modest means.
Conventions held no terrors for Ford or his designers, and
were ruthlessly swept aside, the ultimate result being a tribute
to remarkable foresight.
“Lizzie,” as she used to be called, has
earned a wonderful reputation for faith-
ful service, and the new V 8 Ford tested
this week over The Bulletin course
well upholds the family tradition.
There is little resemblance between
the old Model T and the latest car so
far as body profile and mechanical lay-
out are concerned, but the engineer finds
V8 standard sedan, tested by The Bulletin over a strenuous course.
still the old virtues of extreme simplicity
and faithful workmanship.
The motorist cannot, nor does he re-
quire to, make adjustments of tappets,
carburettor or ignition, and the material
used throughout is warranted to be the
best that the Ford research engineers can
evolve.
The car tested was a Standard V 8
Sedan, previously used for demonstra-
tion purposes, and no attempt had been
made to tune the motor to improve per-
formance.
The car was driven by E. Poole, of
Hunt Bros. The speedometer reading
stood at 2476 miles, and inclusive of
driver, observer and passenger the out-
fit weighed 32^cwt.
Heavy rain for two or three days had
made the test course difficult in many
places.
In busy city traffic it was at
once evident that acceleration and
manoeuvrability were of a high standard,
the car responding in a resolute fashion
to the slightest throttle opening, while
steering appeared to be of the same high
degree of accuracy.
Leaving Parramatta (15 miles) and
approaching Baulkham Hills, a heavy fog
was encountered. It persisted for a
further 20 miles and rendered visibility
at speed almost an impossibility.
First measured test was conducted near
Windsor (35 miles), where the car, slowed
down to 15 m.p.h., was put into neutral
and allowed to coast down a slight in-
Ingenious distributor of VB, showing method of adjustment.
cline. After it came to a standstill the
distance was checked and found to be
704 yards, proving beyond doubt that all
bearings and transmission gear were free
and that alignment was correct.
Approaching Richmond a test of maxi-
mum speed was made, the measured mile
being clocked in 47 l-ssec., an average
of 76.3 m.p.h. During this burst the car
held the road splendidly and the engine
gave no indication of pinking or rough-
ness.
Continuing through the Richmond
Valley, steeper grades were the order of
going, but no difficulty was experienced
in negotiating this section in top gear
with ample reserve of power.
Kurrajong—the notorious test hill —
was next to be faced for a timed climb
of a little more than two miles, and
here the V 8 proved its tremendous
power. The time occupied from a stand-
ing start was 3min. 18sec. —a splendid
effort. Despite the four acute bends in
this difficult climb, enforcing a speed
reduction to between 10 and 15 m.p.h.,
the average from a standing start worked
out at almost 30 m.p.h., and, although
driven hard on corners, the outfit sat on
the road in a safe manner, with a dis-
tinct absence of swaying or rolling.
Descending the hill on the returri jour-
ney a detour was made over typical clay
roads through Grose Vale. Along
this greasy section, with the speedometer
around the 40 mark, the car showed no
inclination to skid or wander.
Heading cross country from Richmond
along Castlereagh-road the most critical
tests of the series were then made —slow
running and acceleration. Here the car
covered 350 yards first in top gear as
slowly as possible and then accelerated
for a similar distance with throttle hard
down.
Slow-running section was clocked in
3min. 38sec., an average of 3 1-3 m.p.h.,
while the 350-yard “accelerated” was
covered in 19 seconds —averaging 38
m.p.h., and crossing the finishing line with
the speedometer almost on the 60-mark.
The next test involved acceleration in
top and second gears from a steady 10
m.p.h. to 30, and again the V 8 showed
excellent results, the times taken being
7 3-5 and 4 4-5 seconds respectively. A
further test was then made accelerating
from a standing start to 50 m.p.h.
through all gears. The time occupied was
but 12 2-ssec., proving conclusively the
high power developed by the V 8 motor.
Through Penrith and cruising along
the Western-road on the return journey
the mechanical braking equipment was
tested. The car
pulled up from a
speed of 25
m.p.h. in 28ft.
Petrol con-
sumption for the
whole test, cover-
ing 115 miles,
was 5|- gallons,
averaging 22.5
miles per gallon
(36 1-3 ton miles
per gallon), which,
taken in conjunc-
tion with an aver-
age speed, inclu-
sive of all tests,
of 351 m.p.h.,
could be regard-
ed as an excellent
all-round perfor-
mance.
Final test of steering involved measur-
ing left and right locks, the turning circle
in both cases being 37 feet—a comfort-
able “one lock” turn in a standard width
roadway.
The eight-cylinder V-type motor has a
bore of 3 1-16 inches and stroke of 3i
inches. It is rated at 30 h.p. R.A.C., but
develops a maximum of 85 h.p. at 3800
r.p.m.
Set at 90 degrees the two banks of four
cylinders are cast en bloc, using L-head
valve arrangement. Compression ratio
is extremely high—6.3 to I—but is made
possible even when operating with
second-grade fuels by the use of a com-
bustion chamber of new design together
with detachable cast aluminium cylinder
heads. A short, sturdy crankshaft, 2in.
in diameter, balanced both statically and
dynamically, is used, and the connecting-
rod bearings, almost 2in. long, ensure
long life and freedom from trouble.
Split skirt aluminium pistons are fitted
each with three rings, the gudgeon pins
being fin. diameter, full floating type,
honed and polished. Valves are of special
heat-resisting steel, mushroom type,
turned in one piece and without clear-
ance adjustment, thereby eliminating the
possibility of faulty setting.
Fuel is drawn from a rear tank by
means of a mechanical pump driven
from an eccentric on the camshaft and
delivered to a dual downdraft carburet-
tor, equipped with dual hot-spot mani-
fold, resulting in easy starting, great
power, low petrol consumption and even
distribution of mixture to the various
cylinders.
To the carburettor intake is fitted a
highly efficient air purifier and silencer,
while the carburettor itself is entirely
automatic in action, all adjustments re-
maining permanently correct unless wil-
fully tampered with.
Coiband-battery system of ignition is
used, incorporating a new and trouble-
free type of distributor, vacuum-con-
trolled and driven directly off the cam-
shaft.
The power unit is suspended in the
chassis on three live rubber supports,
thereby preventing engine vibration from
being transmitted to chassis or body.
Furthermore, engine radius rods (an ex-
clusive Ford development) serve to keep
the motor in its exact position while per-
mitting the rubber mountings to function
freely.
Transmission is through a single-plate
dry clutch to a three-speed gearbox with

gear pinions being provided for in both
top and second. Final drive is through
open propeller shaft to three-quarter-
floating rear axle, with differential of
spiral bevel type and a ratio of 4.11 to 1.
Chassis is of double drop “X” type,
with “X” members continuing to end of
side members —an extremely rigid layout.
Brakes are internal expanding, mechani-
cally operated, on all four wheels, while
the hand brake is coupled by separate
rods to rear wheels alone.
Semi-reversible worm and three-tooth-
sector type of steering is fitted, with self-
adjusting thrust bearings, the reduction
ratio being 15 to 1.
Generally impressions gained during
this strenuous trial were that the V 8
would readily comply with any demand
made upon it by even the most critical
motorist. With ample reserve of power
the instant response to throttle-opening
makes driving a distinct pleasure. Steer-
ing is good without being unduly sensi-
tive, while suspension and riding quali-
ties are at once comfortable and safe.
The all-steel Australian body is of
good workmanship, thoroughly con-
structed and nicely finished. Hardware
and internal fittings are of good material,
while the armrest fitted on the driver’s
side serves to lessen fatigue on long runs.
“LEADED” PETROLS.
The news that three additional major
oil companies propose marketing
“leaded” petrol will gladden the hearts
of many Australian motorists.
Sinoe automobiles were first intro-
duced the engineer has been one jump
ahead of fuels at his disposal, and in
racing practice, or when driving “hotted-
up” stock cars for speed competition, a
doped or mixed fuel of some description
has invariably been used.
The possessors of 1934 models
equipped with special anti-knock cylinder
heads and combustion chambers have
little reason for worry, but earlier models
have, in many instances, a nasty habit
of pinking when running uphill or driven
under heavy load, occasions when the
driver requires all the power he can get.
Pinking, as distinct from mechanical
knocking, is definitely due to detonation
of portion of the gas mixture in the com-
bustion chamber, waves of gas striking
the cylinder walls at high velocity giving
rise to that familiar metallic sound.
Ordinary petrols unmixed with some
“anti-knock” medium can only be used
successfully up to certain definite com-
pression pressures before pinking begins ;
and, while modern combustion-chamber
design has to some extent reduced the
evil, it was not until research chemists
evolved tetra-ethyl lead that the problem
was finally solved.
Tetra-ethyl lead is not a fuel in the
accepted sense. It is an oily liquid which
when added in small quantities to petrol
acts as a catalytic agent during the pro-
cess of combustion, reducing flame rate,
and so positively preventing pinking in
any motor. The quantity of tetra-ethyl
lead added to petrol varies according to
the basic “anti-knock” properties of the
fuel to be treated and to the knock
rating required of the final mixture, but
the average used is approximately one
volume to 3000 volumes of spirit.
When “leaded” petrol was first
marketed on a commercial basis a scare
was raised on the grounds of potential
danger to the public due to lead poison-
ing should the fuel be burned by large
numbers of cars in congested areas. Also
it was prophesied that engines would be
seriously damaged by its continued use.
So persistent were these rumors and re-
ports that exhaustive tests were conducted
by the R.A.C. (London) and other recog-
nised authorities.
The result of these tests proved beyond
doubt that, so far as lead poisoning of
the public was concerned, no risk existed,
the pollution of the atmosphere with
carbon monoxide when burning any type
of petrol being a much more serious
matter. Had there been any foundation
for these claims, any evil effects would
have been evident long ago, for in 1931
more than 2,000,000,000 gallons of
“leaded” petrol were consumed in auto-
mobiles in the U.S.A. and Canada alone.
Years of use have also shown that
engines require no greater care and cost
no more to maintain than when running
on ordinary fuel, for, though valves and
combustion chamber may be found to
be colored when dismantled for inspec-
tion, the efficiency of the various units
is in no way affected.
As “leaded” petrols are usually dyed
in order that they may be distinguished
from straight fuels, numbers of motor-
ists refrained from using them, fearing
that damage to the engine or choked
fuel lines would result. There is no occa-
sion for alarm on this score, for the
minute quantity of completely soluble
dye necessary for coloration can do no
more actual harm than perhaps stain
the carburettor or a leaky petrol union—
really an aid to the motorist in detecting
loss.
SPEED LIMITS AND SAFETY.
English motorists, freed from bondage
a little more than three years ago when
the absurd 20 m.p.h. speed limit and its
attendant police traps were abolished,
have been staggered by the terms of the
new Road Traffic Act, wherein the speed
limit is to be reimposed.
If figures count for anything, the Min-
ister of Transport, in sponsoring this
measure, has stepped off on the wrong
leg, for 27 years of practical experiment
have shown that a speed limit of 20
m.p.h. does not reduce either the number
or percentage of accidents, and that such
a restriction leads to so many injustices
and to so many abuses that it becomes
a subject of contempt among motorists.
Finally, police, in order to operate these
speed traps, must be taken from their
more useful work of protecting the public
against crime.
To the end of 1930, when speed limits
were abolished —except, of course, for
local limits imposed by municipal autho-
rities—2B fatal accidents per 10,000 re-

gistered cars occurred yearly. For the
three years without speed limitations
26 fatal accidents were noted for each
10,000 cars, and the annual total of
deaths was reduced by 487.
The U.S.A., with its 27,000,000 cars in
use, demonstrates in a practical manner
the positive necessity for keeping the
traffic stream moving at speed by em-
ploying police to patrol the highways,
and either book up or sidetrack potterers
travelling at less than 40 m.p.h.
Italy has hundreds of miles of toll
speed roads on which motorists, after
paying dues, can travel at any speed
desired without police supervision. The
accident rate on these highways proves
conclusively that speed is not the whole
reason for disaster.
STANDARDISED CONTROLS.
As a general rule few motorists have
occasion to change over from one car
to another, but an emergency may
demand such an experience. Should this
happen at night the average motorist
would be hopelessly at sea in the method
of driving. Only a fortunate few have
either the knack or knowledge required
in manipulating the many types of con-
trols with precision and certainty, and a
motorist not so equipped becomes not
only seriously embarrassed but a poten-
tial danger to other road-users.
The outstanding weakness in auto-
mobile design lies in lack of uniformity
in essential fittings and in standardising
controls.
Taking first the gear-lever, which may
be either to right or left of the driver,
there are to-day at least 12 different posi-
tions in which the four speeds may be
shifted when driving the car. First speed
ahead in one type is in exactly the same
location as reverse in another, while first
gear is in diametrically opposite posi-
tions on two popular makes. With
modern automobiles using automatic
clutches, synchromesh gears and free-
wheeling deviceSj gear-changing is a lost
art. Once a forward gear is selected the
others are foolproof and almost auto-
matic in operation. There are, however,
90 p.c. of “crash” type gearboxes still in
use, and lack of standardisation, together
with the haphazard location of the foot
throttle, is a matter demanding the atten-
tion of designers.
Regarding bodywork and fittings, the
position is almost as bad. In this connec-
tion Australian distributors should imme-
diately take stock of the situation in order
to arrive at a standard arrangement next
year. A cursory examination of half a
dozen leading makes reveals many varia-
tions in practice. That a door can be
opened by turning the handle left and not
right, or that the locking-pins can be
freed by moving up instead of down, may
appear trivial, but it may be the differ-
ence between life and death in an emer-
gency.
Apart from this serious aspect is the
waste of time in fumbling when operat-
ing doors and windows of unfamiliar
types, a matter that with proper co-
operation in design can be easily recti-
fied.
Tail-lights, save in those States permit-
ting switching on from the dash in con-
junction with headlights, are also a source
of worry. Not only does switch loca-
tion vary to an absurd degree, but switch
types are legion, each variety demanding
its measure of practice in making the
contact.

“CLASS-B” PUBLIC ADDRESS POWER
AMPLIFIER.
7 #
Suitable for many purposes where amplification of speech
or music is required, and capable of 20 watts output.
Uses of amplifiers are innumerable,
and include theatre sound equipment,
the augmentation of dance orchestras,
hotel call systems, announcement of
train departures and arrivals, and all
forms of public speaking. In the coun-
try radio dealers are using amplifiers for
a thousand and one purposes. The most
interesting seen by the writer on a recent
The “Class-B” public address amplifier
and turntable assembly.
tour was in Macksville (N.S.W. North
Coast). It is by the courtesy of Mr. C.
J. Czisz, designer of the P.A. system
illustrated here, that technical details
are made available. The assembly is
built into a iin. angle-iron frame 22in.
wide, 9in. deep and 30in. high, with all
joints welded. At the base is fitted a
horizontal section for the record turn-
table platform, measuring 22in. x 18in. x
6in. The turntable and motor are
mounted on 4in. board, together with the
pick-up arm, motor-switch, pilot light
and needle container.
Power Supply.
Behind the turntable assembly is the
power supply, with filter chokes, high
voltage transformer, electrolytic con-
densers, heater transformer and 83 type
mercury vapor rectifier. The panel above
this section (14 gauge black crackle
finish aluminium) contains the faders
and gain control, key switches, H.T. and
L.T. switches, pilot lights for both cir-
cuits, H.T. voltmeter (0 to 500) and mil-
liameter (0 to 150). This milliameter can
be used as an individual plate meter or
may serve as a volume indicator when
connected in the B+ lead to the output
valves.
Controls.
The first fader on the left is used to
control input from any outside source.
Next to this is the microphone battery
switch, which, in the “off”, position, also
breaks the microphone amplifier plate
supply.
The next control to the right is the
microphone fader, then a selector switch
to cut in at any section of the amplifier.
The remaining controls are the pick-up
fader, headphone switch and the 500,000-
ohm gain control.
Circuit Details.
The top compartment holds the ampli-
fier units, including a two-stage speech
section, of which only one stage is nor-
mally used. This first section is carefully
screened to avoid audio interaction. On
the right of this is the 24A audio valve,
and behind it the choke in the driver
plate lead. Next in order are the 59
driver valve, the “Class-B” driver trans-
former and the two 59’s in “Class-B” out-
put. In order that the amplifier may be
used as a modulator, an alternative
tapped secondary transformer is provided,
this being mounted alongside the output
transformer for the auditorium-type
speaker. All the high-voltage wiring and
leads to the microphone, pick-up, heaters
and 240-volt A.C. supply are done in
shielded lead-covered cable. A further
precaution is similar treatment for the
grid and plate leads up to, and including,
the first audio valve. The plate voltage
to the microphone amplifier can be
adjusted to suit requirements, and the
screen voltage on the 24A is 25 volts
above cathode, this being rather critical
to a point. Special fader potentiometers
are used, these being Philips logarithmic
type with a total resistance of 50,000
ohms. As these are shielded, substitutes,
if used, should be shielded similarly. By
this precaution in the early stages the
hum level is kept very low. A system of
push-buttons between the valves on the
top rack operates jacks to control the
plate milliameter.
The Microphone.
This is rather unusual, but very effec-
tive. It consists of a midget dynamic-
type speaker ( minus baffle) rewound for
a six-volt field excitation and used with
an input transformer having a secondary
impedance of 11,000 ohms. It is con-
nected by a four-wire shielded cable to a
five-pin speaker plug and socket as indi-
cated in the diagram.

PUSH-PULL 2A3 AMPLIFIER.
Power amplifiers are of interest to
many constructor readers, and particu-
larly to country dealers with a demand
for public-address equipment. The cir-
cuit diagram illustrates a “Class-A"
amplifier using type 2A3 valves, cap-
able of developing 15 watts of audio
power. The frequency response is com-
parable with that of the average modern
broadcasting station. Either a radio and
pick-up input or microphone input is
provided, these being used separately or
at the same time by mixing. Thus, by a
separate level control, a musical back-
ground may be superimposed upon
announcements if desired. The dual
potentiometers may be replaced by two
for each input, with the movable con-
tacts connected. The potentiometers
should be of the logarithmic type. From
the faders, the input is taken to a type
’56 valve which is coupled by means of
a high-quality push-pull input trans-
former, such as the Ferranti AFSC, to a
pair of ’s6’s. This stage is followed by
a double push-pull transformer (AFSCC)
coupling to two type 2A3 valves.
Power Supply.
For power you require a conventional
rectifier-filter system, with a 5Z3 rectifier.
Electrolytic condensers are used through-
out the power supply, as the plate voltage
to the 2A3 valves is 300 volts. Negative
bias is applied to the grids of the 2A3’s
by means of the 600-ohm 20-watt re-
sister and 10 mfd. by-pass in the negative
lead of the power supply. The bias is
adjusted so that a milliameter in series
with the plate supply to the 2A3’s reads
80ma. with no signal input. To prevent
any possibility of parasitic oscillation, it
is advisable to earth effectively the
chassis of the amplifier, metal arm of the
pick-up and the casing of the turntable
motor. Reference to the diagram shows
that an output transformer with two
ratios is suggested, to suit the voice coils
of different loudspeakers, but the method
of coupling depends mainly on the
speaker, or speakers. All values are in-
dicated in the diagram, and for “Class A”
operation such an amplifier will be hard
to beat.
“BULLETIN” TEST REVIEW.
( Manufacturers’ products considered worthy of attention will be regularly
reviewed in this section .)
'‘All-wave” receivers of varying quali-
ties have been tested by the writer since
the demand for this type arose in Aus-
tralia, and an appreciation has been ar-
rived at of the forethought, careful
mechanical and electrical design and
extensive laboratory equipment which
must lie behind the really efficient high-
quality all-wave receiver. The subject
of this, the first Test Review, the Tasma
Model 185, is worthy of the highest
praise.
After having heard several of these
receivers in action in country towns
during a recent tour of N. S. Wales,
and been impressed by the remarkable
absence of spurious noises, such as valve
hiss and faulty switch contacts, the writer
decided to put the Tasma Model 185
through its paces in his laboratory. Any
receiver which will give satisfaction
in these circumstances is good, for the
laboratory location is one of the most
unfavorable in Sydney. Tasma 185, from
the time it wa§ switched on, gave an
excellent impression.
With the prevailing winter conditions,
the broadcast band brought to light sev-
eral inter-State stations in daylight hours,
and at night the dial found every Aus-
tralian station, together with Maori-
landers and foreigners. A change to the
short-wave bands showed remarkably
easy and foolproof operation, tuning in
these ranges being done with all the
facility of the broadcast range. At this
time of the year, FYA Paris is audible
between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on 25 metres,
and the Tasma 185 excelled anything the
writer has yet heard in reception of this
station. Daventry, Moscow, Berlin,
Americans and countless others, includ-
ing American amateurs using telephony,
were logged with surprising ease. There
are all-wave receivers that are in-
sensitive on the short-wave side, and
require a long external aerial for good
pick-up, but the Tasma 185 is quite sen-
sitive enough for use with inside aerial,
this being also ample for reception be-
tween 200 and 550 metres.

Modern Transmitter
Technique.
Link coupling between R.F. power
amplifier stages ensures the maxi-
mum transfer of energy from one
stage to another. It is applicable to
all types of transmitters, broadcast
or experimental.
Broadcast engineers and experimental
transmitters are investigating the advan-
tages of link coupling, as introduced by
the technical staff of the American pub-
lication “Radio.” Much higher efficiency
between stages is obtained with this sys-
tem, but the adjustment, being very dif-
ferent from the capacity coupling method,
can be confusing. The circuit diagram
given here and the following instructions
will clarify the procedure. A triode
neutralised single-ended stage is indi-
cated, the values of capacity and in-
ductance being dependent on the fre-
quency range.
First tune C 2 to a point known to be
off resonance. Place the coupling loop
round the centre of the plate tank coil
of the preceding driver stage. Place the
other loop at the “cold” end of the grid
coil LI. Note the reading indicated by
the grid milliameter (MAI) with the
plate voltage disconnected, filament
heated, and centre-tap connected to B
negative. Then tune Cl until a maxi-
mum reading is indicated by MAI. Next
tune C 2 until the plate milliameter
(MA2) shows a decided dip, and leave
the condenser at this position. Then set
the neutralising tap at the approximate
position for correct neutralisation on
L 2, and vary the neutralising condenser
(NC) for the maximum reading on
MAI. Cl must be reset for each setting
of NC to bring the grid current back to
maximum. The highest reading of grid
current during this compensating adjust-
ment is the point of correct neutralisa-
tion. Tuning C 2 through resonance
should show no sign of flicker on MAI,
otherwise the stage is not neutralised
and adjustments must be repeated, but
with a different setting of the tap on L 2.
When all adjustments have been made
satisfactorily, plate voltage may be
applied, and C 2 tuned until MA2 shows
minimum current.
Using this coupling method for experi-
mental purposes, an R.C.A. 210 running
at 25 watts is ample to fully excite a
Mullard SW/2 with 200 watts input.
D. B. K.
A Self-modulated Test Oscillator.
Following on publication of details of
a modulated oscillator suitable for lining
up receivers at the signal frequency,
many requests have been made for
specifications of a similar oscillator for
465 kilocycles, the intermediate fre-
quency used in the majority of super-
heterodynes to-day. A modulated low-
frequency signal is necessary in order to
peak intermediate stages correctly, other-
wise one can tune LF. transformers for
hours without hitting resonance. The
oscillator illustrated is of the Hartley
form, but with a large grid condenser
and high value of leak for self-modula-
tion. The grid condenser is .002 mfd. and
the leak one megohm. The coil is wound
on a 2in. diameter former with 240 turns
of 34 silk-covered wire, and tapped 75
turns from the grid end. Using a stan-
dard variable condenser, .00036 mfd.,
465 kc. will be reached with the con-
denser about half capacity.
To determine when this is so, the
second harmonic may be listened to on
a broadcast receiver at 930 kc. (wave-
length of 3UZ, Melbourne, just above
2GB on the dial), and the fundamental
will then be on the usual intermediate
frequency, 465 kc. Condenser C 3 in the
diagram may be any large capacity, such
as .002 mfd. Any general purpose
medium impedance valve will be suit-
able.
SHORT-WAVE PROS AND CONS.
Split-stator for All Waves.
The chief difficulty encountered in the
design of the all-wave receiver is that of
providing suitable capacity to cover all
frequencies. If a small condenser is
used, such as .00015 mfd., two switch
sections and coils are required to cover
the normal broadcast range between 200
and 550 metres. This is an inconveni-
ence. If a larger condenser is employed,
enabling coverage of the broadcast range,
as with the usual broadcast receiver,
this capacity renders tuning difficult on
the short-wave bands. Even if you have a
special slow-motion tuning dial, the ratio
of capacity to inductance is far too large,
with consequent loss of signal strength.
The remedy lies in the split-stator vari-
able condenser as used in the “Wide-
World Three” receiver. On the short
waves the smaller capacity section alone
is in circuit, the extra stator section being
shunted when tuning between 200 and
550 metres. Thus a medium ratio tuning
dial may be used with full efficiency on
all wavebands.
Unsuspected Trouble.
Many constructors of short-wave re-
ceivers at some time or other experience
trouble in the nature of lack of oscil-
lation, either in an oscillator in a super-
heterodyne or a regenerative detector.
A case in point, applying to the former,
is an example of how the least-suspected
component can be the cause of the
trouble. The superhet was of modern
design, with wave-change switching in
place of plug-in coils. Oscillation was
present over the lower frequencies, i.e.,
“80” and “40” metres, but was absent
on the “20”-metre range. Everything
was carefully checked over —no wiring
mistakes, and all leads as short and
direct as possible. Finally the cause of
the trouble was located in the wave-
change switch, faultless in itself so far
as the mechanism was concerned. This
switch had a lengthy metal frame, with
the various “decks” well separated, and
was fixed under the chassis by a tapped
plate at the control end. Although this
mounting of the switch fratne, metal to
chassis, to all intents and purposes
formed a definite earth connection, when
the frame was earthed at both ends the
oscillator functioned perfectly and
smoothly over the highest frequency
range.
Which Oscillator Control?
Short-wave enthusiasts often argue
the merits and demerits of screen voltage
potentiometer versus the “throttle” con-
denser means of controlling oscillation
in a regenerative detector. Each method
has advantages and disadvantages. The
screen potentiometer varies the D.C.
voltage applied to the screening grid of
the detector valve, and, by doing this,
varies the amplifying abilities of the
valve. Regeneration depends on the
amplification, and so this method pro-
vides a sensitive and very smooth form
of control. It is essential, however, that
there is exactly the correct amount of
feed-back coupling into the grid circuit,
otherwise the sensitivity falls off consider-
ably. Because of this it is difficult to
wind coils to an accepted standard with-
out adopting a great deal of “cut and
try” on the number of feed-back coil
turns to use, so that the very edge of
oscillation will occur at a screen voltage
permitting extremely sensitive detection.
With the “throttle” condenser connected
between the feed-back coil and earth, the
screen-grid voltage can be fixed for most
efficient detection, and then the regenera-
tion may be adjusted by varying the
amount of external feed-back.
The number of turns on a plug-in coil
is not critical, because the variable
capacity rectifies any mistakes made.
“Throttle” control of regeneration has two
interrelated disadvantages. Operation of
the control has a serious effect by detun-
ing the grid circuit, and the amount of
feed-back varies considerably over even
a narrow tuning band. Thus there are
two interlocking controls, and both must
be adjusted constantly as a wide range
of frequencies is covered. Probably the
most satisfactory arrangement is to use
the screen potentiometer control with
screen-grid feed-back by means of a
cathode tap on the grid coil, as in the
“Wide-World Three.” This is the con-
ventional electron-coupled oscillator cir-
cuit first introduced by Lieut. J. B. Dow,
U.S.N. If the tap is properly located, it
is possible to tune across three or four
hundred kilocycles without touching the
regeneration control. The detector may
be maintained at, that very highly sensi-
tive point just beyond the threshold of
oscillation over the whole range. Once
a circuit is so balanced, a change of
valve may necessitate a slight change in

In France a radio dealer supplied a
faulty all-electric receiver. The purchaser
was electrocuted, and the dealer, his
salesman and his installation mechanic
were condemned at Amiens to pay 80,000
francs to the widow, the same amount to
the daughter and a further 10,000 francs
to the parents of the deceased. There is a
great deal to be said for the rigidity of
(he Australian electrical regulations,
which are carefully observed by most
radio manufacturers.

A permanent radio link is proposed for
the new Liberty broadcasting station,
U.S.A. The transmitting equipment will
be at Bedloe’s Island, New York, and
because of intense harbor traffic cannot
be linked with the city studio by sub-
marine cable. The programmes will be
fed to the transmitter by a special short-
wave channel from the mainland.

“Class-B” valves in radio-frequency
amplifier circuits are the latest in extreme
economy for battery receivers, accord-
ing to “Popular Wireless” (England).
Experimental circuits suggest the use of
a “Class-B” push-pull R.F. amplifier, pre-
ceded by an R.F. pentode, and followed
by a “Westector” detector, driver and
“Class-B” audio output. It is claimed
that such an arrangement will provide the
“completely quiescent” receiver.
English amateur transmitters appar-
ently have a fair field for the application
of apparatus in semi-commercial capaci-
ties. In Australia any suggestion of
amateur enterprise is frowned upon as
“revenue-pinching.” Three amateurs -in
Kent gave good service to the Hythe life-
boat brigade by supplying a receiver
tuning to the coastguard and aircraft dis-
tress wave-lengths, resulting in the saving
of many lives by prompt attention to
urgent calls. In U.S.A. amateur stations
are looked upon as a national asset in
time of flood, hurricane or earthquake.
Maoriland also has its well-organised
Amateur Emergency Corps.

Broadcasting stations in Europe and
America are testing the effects of ver-
tical radiating systems instead of the
hitherto accepted horizontal aerial wire
array. It is reported that much more
satisfactory coverage of a defined service
area is obtained, and that fading is
greatly minimised. In some cases the
vertical radiator consists of a metal
superstructure upon a wooden base, the
metalwork of the structure being the
actual radiator. In others, the arrange-
ment is a high, wooden lattice tower,
with a metal cable stretched through the
centre. The idea might be worthy of a
trial in this country.

An interesting story of the life of wire-
less-operators on lonely Willis Island is
told by Messrs. Hooper and Coley, who
for the past 12 months have been in
charge of the A.W.A. station there. A
peculiarity of the island is that the herald-
ing of an approaching storm is invariably
denoted by a curious swell on the sea.
On one occasion a cyclone tore right
across the island at a rate of 70 m.p.h.
in a spiral direction, advancing at a rate
of 20 m.p.h. Turtles provide an interest-
ing diversion, and after marking one
turtle it was found that she made three
trips to the island, with 12-day intervals,
to deposit eggs. Bird life exists in pro-
fusion, and among these winged inhabi-
tants are to be found frigate-birds and
gannets, the larger species attacking the
gannets in flight and forcing them to
disgorge their catch of fish.

Subjects of general interest arising from sub-
scribers’ problems will be dealt with in reason-
able detail, and circuit diagrams will be pub-
lished where possible.
Every inquiry must be confined to one
subject.
I recently bought a B eliminator, described
as designed to use a type ’BO rectifier. Examina-
tion of the rectifier socket shows the plate and
grid terminals connected together. Is the
description correct ? \.
Possibly the eliminator is one of the home-
made variety and
originally used a
201 A, with grid and
plate connected, as
a half-wave recti-
fier. If the filament
winding is sufficient
in amperage to
heat the type ’BO,
this can be used in
the socket, the two
plates then being
used as one in half-
wave rectification.
Is it possible to
fit a .dynamic
speaker to a receiver
of 1928 vintage, using a 71 A output valve;
and, if so, what is a suitable type ? —2.
A D.C. dynamic speaker with a 2500-ohm 1
field could be used in the accepted way. The
2500-ohm field should be connected in place
of the filter choke (30hy.) now in the power
supply, and the speaker input transformer must
be suitable for the valve. A transformer for
a type ’45 valve will serve the purpose. Alter-
nately, a dynamic speaker with field excitation
from the 240-volt A.C. mains, with vacuum or
dry rectifier, may be used.
Will a potentiometer connected across the
filament of the detector valve in a short-wave
regenerative receiver (battery operated) assist
reception ? —lB.
Yes. The grid leak is removed from its usual
position across the grid condenser, and the
“bottom” end is connected to the moving con-
tact of the potentiometer, as illustrated in the
diagram. The potentiometer, being directly
across the filament, will draw a small current,
but this will not materially affect the filament
supply. The potentiometer is adjusted to the
smoothest oscillation point.
I am making a three-valve receiver of the
battery type, but with plate voltage from a B
eliminator. Is there any advantage to be gained
by using the old-fashioned movable honeycomb
or spiderweb coils ? —4.
There is an advantage in being able to vary
one of the coils —the aerial coupling coil. If
this is tuned and variably coupled, it assists
selectivity and DX capabilities. A fault of
modern receivers is that the aerial coupling is
neither one thing nor the other, and the same
fixed coil is expected to suit any aerial system.
I have been experimenting with a B elimi-
nator of the Ford coil kind, and have suc-
ceeded in making a small set work with it
after a fashion, but there does not appear to
be much power available. How can I improve
the efficiency ? —6.
Trouble is due to the fact that insufficient
power is being used for excitation. One and
a half volts is not enough; four or six volts
should be used on the coil.
1 am very interested in home recording, but
before spending money on apparatus would
like to profit by others’ experience. Is there
anyone in Sydney who has had success at it ?
—7.
Home recording is quite satisfactory provided
a high fidelity audio amplifier is used.
s H.M.S.,” writer of short-wave notes for “Aus-
tralian Radio News,” obtained good results
with recording of overseas stations, such as
Daventry and Paris. “H;M.S.” is M. Sheffer,
care Sheldon Drug Co., 131 Clarertce-street,
Sydney.
Where can an up-to-date list of the world's
chief short-wave broadcasting stations be
obtained ? —l6.
Swains, Pitt-street, Sydney, stock the “Radio
Amateur Call Book,” an American magazine.
This contains a directory of all amateur trans-
mitting stations in the world, and also a large
commercial section headed “Who’s Who on the
Short Waves.”
Will a two-volt battery valve operate from
one dry cell, or must two cells be used with
a potentiometer to reduce the voltage ? Also,
is it necessary to use a condenser with the
small A.C. motor in “A.R.N.” l/6/’34. ? —17.
Two cells will be necessary with a series
resistance to drop the voltage from three to
two volts. A small 20-ohm rheostat will do.
No condenser is necessary with that type of
A.C. motor.
How many amateur transmitters are licensed
in Australia ? —l9.
Approximately 1200. The number is increas-
ing monthly. Majority of licensees remain
active.
Qualifications necessary to obtain a license
to experiment in amateur transmission ? —2O.
Examinations are held regularly for the
amateur operator’s proficiency certificate at the
Wireless Branch, Radio Inspector’s Office, Hay-
market Post Office, Sydney. Subjects include
theoretical and practical knowledge of radio
fundamentals, including transmitters, and the
sending and receiving of international Morse
at 12 words per minute. A knowledge is also
necessary of correct operating procedure.
Write to the Radio Inspector for a sample
examination paper.
Please illustrate a circuit for a three-valve
T.R.F. short-wave receiver with bandspread.
The valves l wish to use are PM 14, PM4DX
and PM24A. Detdils of coils are wanted ?
27.
The circuit diagram shows a short-wave
receiver of the type requested. Band-spreading
is done by using a small variable capacity, C 3,
in shunt with the main tuning condenser, C 2.
C 2 and Cl are equal in capacity and may be
anything from .00014 to .000175 mfd. A
three-plate midget will do for C 3. Tuned
anode coupling to the R.F. stage, thereby
feeding D.C. through the detector grid coil,
means that the condensers C 2 and C 3 must
be carefully insulated, being 135 volts above
earth. A 23-plate midget may be used for
C 4, which is the oscillation control. The aerial
coupling condenser A.C. is a two- or three-
plate midget. Coil specification suggested is:
14 to 28 metres: Grid coils, five turns 26
D.S.C.; reaction coil, four turns. 26 to 50
metres: Grid coils, 12 turns 26 D.S.C.; re-
action coil, seven turns. 48 to 90 metres: Grid
coils, 24 turns 26 D.S.C.; reaction coil, 12
turns 28 or 30 D.S.C. All coils wound on
Hin. diameter ribbed plug-in formers.
Where can a list of the broadcasting stations
in Australia be obtained ? —B.
Send 2s. 6d. to the Postmaster-General’s De-
partment, Wireless Branch, Treasury Gardens,
Melbourne C. 2, for the complete list. Monthly
amendments and alterations are sent for the
year, the list containing also the rapidly in-
creasing number of experimental (amateur)
transmitting stations.
What strength may be expected from a sen-
sitive gramophone pick-up ? —2l.
There are so many factors to be considered
that it is almost impossible to give a definite
answer. Roughly, a moderately sensitive pick-
up will give an output comparable to that from
a single valve receiver used about 10 miles
from a broadcasting station, so that if you
use a broadcast receiver with a detector and
two audio stages the audio amplifier portion
used for pick-up reproduction will give as
much volume from a record as you would
obtain from the local station.

PENALTY DOUBLING.
Having survived a course of lessons
and diligently studied your textbooks, you
possibly feel you are a contract graduate.
You know all about your opening bids,
your take-outs and your raises ; the forc-
ing response is a valued friend, but how
are you on your penalty doubles? Have
you any idea whether you show a profit
or a loss on them? Perhaps by nature
you are a sporting doubler, especially
when opponents have called game. The
tradition seems to have been handed
down from auction days that there is no
harm done in doubling a game contract.
For years it has been known by the de-
ceptive title of the “free double,” but the
habit, if indulged in, is likely to cost you
dear.
Just consider it this way. With
reasonably good players, if two partners
are allowed to exchange information and
finally arrive at a game contract, they
are not likely to be far short of it.
Unless they have run into a frightfully
bad distribution, you won’t put them
down more than a trick. That is 200
vulnerable, or 100 not vulnerable. Against
that you run the risk of a redouble from
a clever player, which may net him a
further 360 points. Should the cards break
badly for you, he may make an over-
trick, thus earning another 200 or 100.
You are therefore risking the loss of 560
points for a possible gain of one or two
hundred. Lastly, by your “free double”
you may place for the declarer the only
outstanding cards which would be likely
to worry him.
Don’t think that I am averse from all
doubles. Far from it. It does not do
to have the reputation of never doubling,
because it will encourage the opposition
tp bid up and talk you out of games or
useful part-scores. But I want to impress
on you that the biggest penalties are
nearly always obtained from doubles of
smaller contracts. There are two prin-
cipal situations to be reckoned with.
One is where a couple of bids have been
made by the opposition, and you can see
that they are an obvious misfit. Penalty
points are often missed here through
waiting for your opponents to get further
into trouble. The second situation where
the chance to double is often missed is
when one of the opposition has made an
overcall of your partner’s opening bid.
Bear, in mind that, it being an opening
bid, your partner holds at least two and
a half tricks in defence against any oppos-
ing declaration. Accordingly, if you have
four or five playing tricks in the oppo-
nent’s bid, including two or three trump
tricks, your proper procedure is to double.
Of course, it may not be left in. Your
partner may take it out, or your oppo-
nents may decide to seek cover, with
sometimes surprising results.
Here’s a case, taken from actual play,
where an inexperienced player might miss
the double. Perhaps he would call two
no trumps, which would be a very bad
bid, or three no trumps, which is not so
bad. The one big reason for preferring
the double on this occasion is that your
prospective penalty looks greater than the
value of the game you probably can get.
With both sides vulnerable, the bidding
in this instance went:
S W N E
IS 2H ?
You are sitting North, and you hold:
K, 6
V—A, J, 9, 7
4—Q, 10, 3
*-K, J, 4, 2
The , first , thing is to try to place your
partner’s hand. To justify his original
bid. he; should hold something like A, Q
or A, J in spades, with ace of diamonds
or ace of clubs, or possibly he has Q,
J, 10 to five spades, with both the minor
aces. In any event, West is in a bad way,
and should sustain a severe penalty. All
this is an obvious inference. Well, the
double is made, and quite ordinary play
makes nine tricks for North-South ; that
is, East-West are penalised 1400 points.
West had made quite a reasonable vul-
nerable overcall, having due regard for
-Mr. Culbertson’s “Rule of Two and
Three,” but found himself sandwiched
between two strong hands, and his
partner with nothing.
His hand consists of:
♦ —x, x
V —K, Q, 10, x, x
—K, J, x
*— A, Q, x
A very powerful selection, and one on
which an informatory double is usually
a much better bid. However, in this
instance it would not have mattered, as
over the inevitable redouble from South
East must pass, and West’s attempt to
extricate himself with two hearts leaves
him no better off.
When a first-class player doubles a
game contract, it is always on the assump-
tion that he can set the declaration by
two tricks at least, and that he and his
partner are not sacrificing a game in
doing so. Of course, if it becomes evi-
dent in the bidding that the opponents
are three or four tricks out of their
depth, while he is certain of game, then
the penalty is weighed against the game
and the decision made.
The confusion of the penalty with the
informative double is not so rife to-day,
on account of the prevalence-of teachers
and textbooks. In the example already
given there should be no doubt in South’s
mind as to what North means when he
says “Double.” South has already
announced his suit, so North cannot want
to hear about it again. North is saying:
“Partner, we can defeat this contract for
a penalty bigger than any game we may
have between us.” This is the natural
and commonsense interpretation of any
double after the doubler’s partner has
made a bid.
Let us review another penalty double
which looks sound enough to meet with
a better fate. It occurred in a contract
game between four fairly good players.
North had been sitting for a couple of
hours with most of the refuse of the
pack, so that must be some excuse for
his light opening bid. Here are the
hands: —
x, x, x, x
V-J, X

THE BIDDING.
N E S W
1C Dbl. 2H P
2NT P 3S P
4S Dbl. P P
Over North’s light opening bid East
has the requisite honor tricks for an
informatory or take-out double, but his
distribution is bad. He has no escape
suit in case of a redouble, and few play-
ing tricks in any suit his partner may
name. Also, the hand looks powerful in
defence, and is the type on which it often
pays to keep quiet. As it happens, distri-
bution beat it in this instance, but that
was partly because of the original take-
out followed by the business double.
Returning to the bidding, you will
notice that South was undeterred by
East’s remark, and made a forcing take-
out. West is under no restraint to pass,
and North, feeling rather guilty, ex-
presses remorse with two no trumps. East
now awaits developments. South still
hopes for a game, and, knowing that
North will pick the better of the major
suits, makes him choose. East now wakes
up, and ranks the ultimate four spades as
an affront; even with the very probable
blank hand from his partner, a one-trick
set seems assured. Nevertheless this busi-
ness double is even more unsound than
the previous take-out double on the same
hand. It can’t set the contract more than
one trick; there is the risk of the re-
double, and, finally, it definitely locates
all the missing honors for North and
South.
West’s opening lead is a small diamond,
won by the ace, and, for want of some-
thing better, returned to put dummy in.
On the first trump lead, East, of course,
ducks. South finesses the nine, and after
that the rest is easy. The hearts are set
up, trumping the third round. A diamond
is discarded on the club ace, the trump
brought through again, and East’s hand
is for sale after making the two red aces.
The hand is quoted, not as an example
of play, but to demonstrate some good
bidding by North and South in the face
of interference, and also two rather
thoughtless doubles by East. It is testi-
mony to the advisability of saying nothing
when you have nothing constructive to
say

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Redditch came into his own again in
the Wanda Steeplechase at Caulfield.
Fred Hoysted, the trainer, re-enlisted the
services of Hynes, and for this former
Sydney horseman Redditch gave a fine
display, romping home seven lengths in
advance of The Cracksman, with Wid-
giewa a moderate third. For half the
journey Redditch was not at his best;
brush fences appeared to bother him
whenever encountered. But at the post-
and-railers and logs opposite the stand he
revealed the old vim and brilliance. Tak-
ing off half a length behind (and between)
two leaders, he passed them in the air,
skimming the obstacle so closely that his
surcingle almost touched it. Thereafter
no rival could get near Redditch.
Improving on his form at the V.R.C.
Birthday meeting, The Cracksman beat
the remainder of the field easily enough.
He was runner-up to Redditch in. the
1933 G.N., when ip receipt of 2st.
Weights on July 14 will favor The Cracks-
man to the extent of only 41b. as com-
pared with last year, and there is small
likelihood of the tables being turned.
His victory in the Toolambool Hurdle
suggests that Prismatic will take a lot of
beating in the G.N.H. This horse cap-

AS L.B.W,
tured the A.J.C. Hurdle of 1933, and in
Victoria the Rossendale gelding has done
fairly well on the flat. C. T. Godby
bought him for J. A. Phillips, the book-
maker. Prismatic smothered the leaders
over the last three furlongs of the Tool-
ambool Hurdle, and scored like a cham-
pion. Star God came from a long way
back to run third, and may have an out-
side chance in the National. Oldhome,
on whom McMenamin, from Sydney,
was having his first ride, was well placed
at the turn, but tired. A stable-mate,
Prime Seal, surprised by running third.
Oldhome has lessened in favor for the
National, but he has a lot of pace, is fit
and may have been in need of public
jumping practice. Hynes expressed dis-
gust at the form of Our Comet, who did
not tackle the hurdles with confidence.
Don Zealley made the same complaint
regarding Sarokos.
In the National Baanya is called on to
concede Prismatic 91b. Admirers of the
Tas. candidate believe that he is equal
to the task. Baanya is held in such high
esteem as a galloper that punters accepted
9 to 4 about him in the Richmond
Handicap, despite his 9st. 21b. Soon
after the start Baanya’s saddle slipped,
and for the rest of the journey Jim Munro
practically was out on the withers of his
mount; yet Baanya ran third to Hostile
and the pacemaker, Eagle Eye. Winner
has just had his attention turned to
middle-distance events, and McShortodds
felt emboldened to lay 16 to 1. Con-
sidering the amount of gilt that went
west over Baanya he could well afford
to do so, but after the race there were
the usual grumblings: “Laid my full
book,” “Winner was my worst,” and
so on.
Chelandric, bought for 1400gns. at the
Sydney sales in 1933 by C. B. Kellow, let
his even-money supporters down with a
thud in the second division of the Minook

Handsel, a Brazen colt. Chelandric
wasn’t in the humor for galloping. First

ter of Constant Son, scoring by half a
head from the Tasmanian crack juvenile,
Beaudekin, with Red Ray another half-
head away. A protest for interference
was dismissed. First and second horses
are trained by Bert Price, who piloted
Flash Jack to victory in a G. N. Steeple,
and is a son of D. J. Price.
* * * *
It’s becoming fashionable in Sydney
for horses to run well one week and fail
ingloriously at their next outing. Of
course, horses are not machines; still,
the public would like to see the stewards
afford owners and trainers opportunities
of advancing reasons for the eccentric
displays.
Turbine, holder of the seven-furlong
record at Randwick, won the A.J.C. June
Stakes in an impressive manner. Five
days later he finished at the tail of the
field in the Botany Handicap. In those
races he was piloted by Pratt. In the
Dundas Handicap at Rosehill on Satur-
day McCai;ten had the mount. Sec-
ond fancy at fives (some backers got
sevens), Turbine beat little ‘ Bill Wedge-
wood and the favorite, Persian, point-
less. There was no inquiry.
Backers of Turbine went solidly for
his stable-mate, Miss Notava (5 to 1), in
the Rosehill June Handicap. Ridden by
Pratt, the chestnut mare set up a winning
lead turning for home, and the result
was not in doubt over the last two fur-
longs. Mountain View was a poor
second, and Regal Star, who proved too
much for his small pilot, third. Old
Tangible showed dash in the early stages,
but Polette and Mayonnaise were
failures.
Backed from fives to 6 to 4, the Mar-
conigram colt Short Wave, trained by
E. D. Lawson, gave Pike an easy ride in
the first division of the Juvenile. The
owner, Dr. T. S. Kirkland, has hopes
G f t hi s fellow developing into a Derby
proposition. The bookies scored heavily
over the victories of Pavarti in the sec-
ond division and of Cylanta in the Par-
ramatta Mile. Each started at 20 to 1.

Chatham has been handicapped at lOst.
91b. for the Epsom, lOst. lib. for the
Caulfield Cup and lOst. 81b. for the Can-
tala Stakes ; and in each case he is en-
titled to every pound. But how many
followers of racing would place Winooka
within 21b. of him in the Epsom, as the
A.J.C. handicapper has done? Even the
51b. between them in the Cantala Stakes
seems hard on Winooka, considering his
poor American form. Another harshly-
treated horse is Soft Step, the Queens-
land colt, rising four years, who is
weighted to carry 9st. in the Melbourne
Cup —the same as Limarch, 21b. less than
Hall Mark, 71b. less than Rogilla and
101 b. less than Peter Pan. What has Soft
Step done to warrant such treatment?
Waikare beat him in the Queensland
Derby.
Attractive-looking doubles at the
moment are Whittingham (Bst. 121 b.) or
Waikare (Bst. 21b.), and Rogilla (9st.
111 b.) or Topical (Bst. 111 b.) for the
Epsom and Metrop. ; Rogilla (9st. 101 b.)
or Wheriko (Bst. 71b.), and Peter Pan or
Hall Mark for the two Cups.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Walter Browning met his master at
Leichhardt in Haban Singh. Said to weigh
only 15st. 21b., he seemed stones heavier
than Singh (14st. 41b.); all the same, he
was tossed about like a medicine-ball
until he made the lighter lad submit to a
Boston crab in the fourth. Singh, prior
to this, had squeezed out of every hold
put on him. After winning the fifth from
start to finish the Indian picked Brown-
ing up bodily in the last and slammed
his way to a very popular victory.
Woodfull’s Men
The second Test at Lord’s called a halt
on Saturday night with England 440 for
the first innings and two Australian
wickets down for 192. The Englishmen
batted from Friday morning to close on
3 p.m. on Saturday, scoring at the rate of
48 runs to the round of the clock. With
just three hours to bat, Australia aver-
aged 64 runs per hour. Grimmett and
O’Reilly were comparatively harmless.
Wall, as usual on this ground, did well,
while Chipperfield achieved additional
glory by dismissing Sutcliffe, Hammond
and Wyatt, a formidable trio.
Though Walters, relieved of the cap-
taincy by Wyatt, batted in his best form
for 82, England’s first five wickets went
for 182, Chipperfield snaring Sutcliffe
and Hammond for 3. Then followed
a fine stand by Leyland and ’keeper
Ames, the Yorkshireman reaching 109
before Wall bowled him, and Ames
going on to 120 before McCabe sent
him back. The stand saved England
from a collapse and tired the bowling
sufficiently to allow Verity and the
tail-enders to add an invaluable 50
for the last wickets. Ames, by the way,
is the first English stumper to reach three
figures in a Test. Australia’s best is 74
by Blackham, unless we count in Mur-
doch, who was taken to England as first
Aunt Sally for the 1878 team. His best
Test score was 211. Wall, badly backed
by his fieldsmen again, nevertheless got
through with 4 for 108. Chipperfield’s
figures were 3 for 91. Grimmett and
O’Reilly each took an expensive wicket.
Woodfull opened for Australia with
Brown, Ponsford being in bed with ’flu.
The pair had 68 up when the skipper
was bowled by Bowes for a plodding
22. Brown had been going along in great
style, and he and Bradman had the score
to 141 when Bradman, who had been
going for the bowling from the first, was
caught and bowled off a hanging ball
from Verity for a sterling 36. McCabe
followed, and played out time with
Brown. Mac was 24 at stumps and
Brown 103, both n.o.
Each side dropped several chances, but
the fielding was good in other respects.
Outstanding was the failure of the Eng-
lish fast bowling, which Australians are
alleged to dread. Fames was taken off
after 43 runs had been knocked off him.
Bowes was persevered with, but finished
with 1 for 71. Slow left-hander Verity
(1-24) looked easily the most dangerous.

Footbrawl
Like other promising games this sea-
son Melbourne’s chief scrap on Saturday
—Carlton v. St. Kilda on the latter’s
ground —proved a dud. Going off with
a concerted attack, backed by accurate
marking, the Blues swept the Saints into
the basket, and kept them there. At the
finish, Carlton owned 166 to St. K.’s 108.
Davey, Huxtable and Cashman did well
for the Blues, and Watson and Penny for
the others. Some 30,000 witnessed the rout.
Melbourne went out to Footscray and
surprised the Tricolors, capturing 91 to
’Scray’s 44. Richmond put it over Haw-
thorn to the tune of 110 to 81, and Col-
lingwood similarly dealt with North
Melbourne —112 to 86. The best game
drew only a meagre 20,000 to Fitzroy,
where Essendon matched point for point
with the Maroons throughout a fast and
exciting scuffle. Fitzroy won on the bell
by five points —102 to 97. Three special
trainloads of barrackers journeyed to
Geelong to hearten up South Melbourne,
but found the job too heavy. The loss
of Diggins and Reville seems to have
put the wind up South. Still, Geelong,
as a composite team, is hard to beat at
home with Todd, Metherall, Molony,
Hickey and Quinn doing their best. A
crowd of 14,200 coughed up £350 to see
the Pivotonians score 106 points to 77.
* * * *
Rugby Union matches in Sydney on
Saturday did little to reverse positions
on the table, but several of the clubs
are keeping within striking distance of
the semi-finals, only four points separat-
ing the leading quartet.
Randwick defeated Drummoyne at
Coogee by 19-3, getting five tries, two
converted by Larnach-Jones, to Drum-
moyne’s one. University’s forwards won
a hard game against Western Suburbs by
16-10, scoring three tries to two and
adding a p.g. to two conversions. Wes-
tern crossed twice, Barnes converting
each time. St. George drew with Parra-
matta, 6-6. Manly had a fairly easy
trot against East, 27-15. Northern
Suburbs took on Newcastle in the bye,
and was just trounced by the coalies,
22-20.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Rugby Union has shown
little enterprise in picking its team to
meet Queensland in Sydney this week-
end. With the All-Blacks looming in
the near distance and the need for de-
veloping the tons of young talent seen
every Saturday, one would have thought
a few of the new stars like Richards and
Bedford, to name only two, might have
been given a gallop. Not so; Ross
and Malcolm have both been preferred
for the key positions of full- and half-
back. Both have been great players,
but are definitely on the down grade.
The omission of Cowper is another bad
break, and generally the side is far from
reassuring.
# *
The star turn of the League games was
the battle between those ancient adver-
saries South Sydney and Eastern
Suburbs at the Sports Ground. Playing
a man short most of the time, the
Southerners made a gallant fight of it
before going down 14-10 ; they had been
eight all at half-time. Unbeaten Western
Suburbs had an easy run with Balmain,
and whanged the wheat-lumpers by 23 to
8. St. George also piled on the points
against Newtown, prevailing by 32 to 14.
None of the above is a circumstance to
what North Sydney did to the University
club. At the close of the tragedy the
board showed North 46 (10 tries) to 10
(two tries).

Woodfull’s Men
Australia carried its first-innings score
against the Gentlemen at Lord’s to
230, after six had gone for 164.
The invaluable Grimmett again batted
well (24). Read (2-61), Holmes (3-31)
and Brown (3-45) took the wickets.
With 53 runs against them, the Eng-
lishmen did better in the second in-
nings, Walters batting well for 40 and
Lyon, of Gloucestershire, having a hearty
whack for 67. Holmes (67) and Robins
(64) also showed a bold front, and there
was 287 on the board when Clay was
stumped by Barnett off Grimmett. Wall
took 2 for 65, making his total for the
match 5 for 114. Grimmett got another
four wickets and Ebeling a couple in
each innings.
Australia made the 235 wanted to win
for the loss of two wickets, Barnett (16)
and Ebeling (31). Brown and McCabe
then got together and defied the bowlers,
McCabe flaying them unmercifully for
105 n.o. in as many minutes, his fifth
century. Brown collected a neat and
quiet 62. Read and Brown took a wicket
each.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Up to the end of the
match with the Gentlemen, Australia’s
record shows seven wins of the 13
matches played, the others being drawn.
Comforting is the evidence that the
alleged batting tail is non-existent, all
the team, with the exception of Fleet-
wood-Smith, having averages of over
double figures, while on half a dozen
occasions, as in the Gentlemen’s match,
the bowlers were called on to put their
side in front with their batting, and did.
McCabe has taken the limelight Brad-
man monopolised in 1930. He has strung
up five scores of over 100 in 15 innings
and an aggregate of 1136. Most pro-
mising among the unconsidered batsmen
of the team is left-hander Barnett. He
has proved himself fit for the best com-
pany, and, since he is as good an out-
field as he is a ’keeper, may see a Test
match for his batting capacity alone.
And O’Reilly and Grimmett, with 56
and 67 wickets thus early on the
tour, have done nobly. Wall’s 25 do not
suggest that he is up to his 1930 form,
though he is always at his best in the
big stuff.
* * $ *
“Statist”: Seventeen individual cen-
turies and over scored in the first 13
matches by the Australians in England is
quite encouraging, especially as they are
shared among seven men. In 1930
only six men topped the three figures
during the whole tour. Ebeling,
Bromley and Chipperfield, all of whom
field close in, the first and third in the
slips, have taken nine catches each.
McCabe is credited with seven, O’Reilly
and Brown with five, Grimmett and
Bradman * four, Woodfull and Kippax
three, F.-Smith and Wall two, and
Darling and Ponsford one. Of the
’keepers, Oldfield has caught 10 and
stumped nine, Barnett’s figures being’
eight and nine.
sj: H* % :j:
“Aigburth”: Larwood’s contract with
Notts expires this season. He is likely to
find a refuge with the Lancashire League.
One interesting question is whether Notts
will play the rebel in the county’s
match against Australia at Trent Bridge
on August 11. It is to be hoped that
it will, if only to settle the question of
whether he is really a destructive bowler
to Australians in England.
He He He jjc
“Fleet St.”: London “Daily Sketch” is
telling a glittering tale of Larwood’s
future. A syndicate has been formed to
amalgamate the North of England and
Midland Leagues and play gate-money
cricket. In addition to Larwood, Brad-
man, McCabe and other leading Austra-
lian and English players are to be roped
in to form a galaxy of stars. True or
not, it is an old tale. In the early days
of the last century Lillywhite and others
formed the All England Eleven, which
made tours of England before county
matches had been organised, playing all
and sundry, and against odds if neces-
sary. The money was so good for a bit
that other organisations on the same
lines sprang up, until dog finally ate dog.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: Fames, an amateur
and a Cambridge man, has told the world
how, when he had a job at Leyton in a
bank, he was a.w.l. for two days watch-
“I simply loathe playing against a bad loser. Don’t you, Mr. Ropata?”
“Dunno. Never play against te loser any kind."
ing the 1930 Australians play his county.
Realising that it wasn’t much good going
back to the bank after that he resigned,
banks being bowelless beggars, and de-
cided thereafter “to concentrate on
cricket.” It would be interesting to
know how the young gentleman lives—
he being a public character, the inquiry
is quite legitimate—by concentrating on
cricket as an amateur. The only refuge
writer knows for cricketers who desire
to make their living out of the game
without being stigmatised as profes-
sionals is as secretaries of county clubs.
“Wisden” does not mention Fames as
secretary of Essex.
* * * *
“Leyton”: We are threatened with
some more cricket frightfulness. London
“Daily'Mail” has issued a national appeal
for a cricketing song with a chorus to
become the cricket national anthem. The
prospect is an unpleasant one. Anyone
who has been exposed at rowing and
other functions to the Eton boating song,
bellowed by individuals who have never
been within a hundred thousand miles of
Eton, and wouldn’t know a Tug from
an Oppidan if they saw one, will shudder
at the very notion.
* * * *
“No Ball”: Mailey’s cricket simile
representing a smiling ferret waiting at
the mouth of a rabbit burrow for its prey
(B. 23/5/’34) reminds me of something
1 l'ead in the “Australasian” about 35
years ago. The writer was telling of
Ernie Jones’s fast bowling, and how one
ball hit W. G. Grace in the ribs, with
the result that the batsman “glowered
through his beard.” Granted that the
Old Man had luxuriant whiskers and a
not particularly sweet temper, I have
never been able to see how he glowered
through his beard unless he stood on his
head.
Footbrawl
“Fitzcray”: Victorian football heads
are upset at the increasing number of
casualties in the game. One sensible
theory to account for it is that the exces-
sive amount of training, massage, etc., now
the fashion with teams, gets the players
too finely drawn, with no reserves to com-
bat extra strain. That may be said of
other games, including cricket. Super-
training, massage, electric treatment in
nursing homes and kindred fantods were
unheard of a few years ago, yet the list
of sick and sorry in touring teams was
much smaller than to-day. Rugby foot-
ball and even tennis are in the same cate-
gory as regards over-preparation of
players. The intensive methods needed
to get a man fit to run 100 yards in
lOsec. are out of place with athletes re-
quired to keep bullocking for three-
quarters of an hour at a stretch.
* * * *
“Huon”: Victoria still goes gaily on
its way of pinching promising Australian
Rules footballers from other States. The
annual match at Launceston between
North and South Tassie was attended by
hordes of mysterious folk from over the
water, who missed no opportunity -of
whispering the most prominent players.
Chairman Miller, of the Tassie League,
flew off the handle after the match, and
said that he had refused a Victorian
scout permission to interview one player.
In spite of this, the gladiator was fur-
tively got at later, and will play in Mel-
bourne next season. Other instances
were quoted, and feeling ran so high that
the sCouts can be considered lucky that
they didn’t have to swim back to the
Cabbage Garden.
* * -j,-. *
“E.S.”: The retirement of S. Milton,
the N.S.W. representative Australian
Rules player, reminds me that the little
chap has a goal-kicking record which even
the better-advertised cracks of Victoria
and South Australia should find it hard
to improve upon. In 16 years’ first-grade
football the Eastern Suburbs player has
landed 1166 goals. Of these, 151 have
been kicked in inter-State matches, and
usually against much more formidable
sides than the Ma State can muster.
“Stand Off”: Sydney will see some
first-class Rugby from the end of the
month to the last week in August.
Queensland will open the campaign with
a return match with N.S.W. on June 30
at Sydney Cricket Ground, a second
game being played the following Monday
at North Sydney Oval. In the two Bris-
bane matches early in the season the
States finished level, N.S.W. winning the
first 26-23, and the home side the second
by 21 to 12. But the big excitement will
be the opening match between N.S.W.
and the All-Blacks at Sydney C.G. on
August 4, followed by another on the
Monday, probably at the Showground.
The next Saturday sees the first Test
between Australia and the visitors at
S.C.G., and the tour ends with the second
at the same place on August 25. On
August 15, 18 and 22 the tourists will
play Queensland at Brisbane, an “Aus-
tralian XV” at the same place, and a
match with Newcastle on the way back
to Sydney.
* * * *
The All-Blacks, who make their Syd-
ney landfall on July 28, will be bossed
this year, not by Billy Wallace, as Was
anticipated, but by A. J. Geddes, one of
the big chiefs of the game in the Shivery
Isles, an ex-holder of the coveted post
of president of the N.Z.R.U., and a
selector to boot. Unlike many of his
contemporaries, the new manager never
cut a figure in big football, though a son
was in Australia with the 1929 All-
Blacks.
¥ H* v 'I-
“Old Q.”: A notable scoring feat was
put up in M.L. Rugby the other day
when that great winger Bullock-Douglas,
here in 1932, scored 23 of Wanganui’s
26 points in a match with Taranaki,
notching five tries and converting four.
Against Queensland at Brisbane in 1907,
F. C. Fryer, of Canterbury, scored the
whole five tries credited to his team and
converted one, making the score 17 to 11.
* * * *
“Losskakkel”: Rugby footballers the
world over will note the retirement from
big football of Ben Osier, the South
African stand-off half. It was not that
he was a great player alone, but as
skipper of the ’Boks he evolved a tac-
tical scheme which made South Africa
practically undefeatable, if it did much
to destroy the most attractive features of
Rugby. His scheme demanded a heavy
and powerful pack able to get the ball to
him. That done he kicked into touch
down the field for a line-out, and the
movement was repeated. Near the enemy
line Osier either had a drop at goal—
and he was a deadly shot—or relied on
his big, bustling forwards to break
through the opposition for the few yards
needed to score a try.
* & * #
“Gate”: The state of armed neutrality
between city and country League foot-
ball organisations in N.S.W. (B. 6/6/’34)
continues. When the country staggered
the townies by taking steps to prevent
the latter “stealing” country footballers,
though they themselves have acquired
half the best players in the metropolis
by enticing them with jobs, the harbor-
side crowd hit back. It has been a prac-
tice of country clubs to ring in Sydney
chaps for Sunday matches. Having also
played in Sydney on the Saturday, the
individual was often returned on the
Monday so dilapidated that he was not
much use to his club for that week, any-
way. This is to be stopped, save when
an official clearance is granted, and that
is going to be as easy to get as ice-cream
in Jehannum.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: Rugby Union football
has been making headway in the U.S.A.
Cambridge University recently paid a
flying visit to the States and played four
matches there. As a consequence, an
Eastern U.S. Rugby Union has been
formed.

“Divot Digger”: Saturday will see the
first of this season’s N.S.W. golf cham-
pionships, the foursomes, to be played at
Kensington. Holders of the title are Jim
Ferrier and G. Thompson, but there are
some tough pairs among the opposition,
including Fawcett and Bettington.
Queensland will be represented for once,
the pair being J. N. Radcliffe and S.
Francis. Radcliffe is a very high-class
player, who has seldom been able to
show outside his State, where he has won
the open, amateur and foursomes cham-
pionships, the last in 1933 in partnership
with Francis.

“Oakleigh”: With a view to improv-
ing its finances, the Victorian Golf Asso-
ciation is revising its constitution, chief
feature of this being a new method of
levying contributions from affiliated
clubs. These will be classified according
to membership strength in the country
and standing and location in the metro-
politan area. The old “associate” clubs
of Melbourne will pay 2s. 6d. per mem-
ber and Is. 6d. for provincial members.
Metropolitan clubs not ranked with these,
and within a 30-mile radius from the
G.P.0., part up Is. 6d. a member. Coun-
try clubs with 100 members or over will
pay three guineas a year, and those with
a membership under three figures two
guineas. This revenue is to be devoted
to establishing a central office, helping
along the work of green research, and
employing a professional to tour coun-
try clubs and advise on course architec-
ture and layout.
“Sandringham”: Melbourne stages an
annual golf match between teams of pro-
fessionals and associate players which
might well be imitated elsewhere. This
year’s was played at Royal Melbourne
between teams of 12 a side, the associates
being given a concession of six strokes
while playing from the forward tees. The
pros, won eight of the singles and all the
foursomes. This puts them one up in
the series, which began in 1923.
“Marino”: Rufus Stewart made a wel-
come reappearance in big golf the other
day when he won the close championship
at Adelaide. Stewart has been handi-
capped by illness during recent years,
and practically rose from a sick bed to
play. The opposition was strong, includ-
ing McMahon, W. P.ymill and Legh
Winser, but Stewart won by 3 strokes,
his card for the 36 holes being 145.
“Hoylake”: The Oliver Kay-Gaisford
pair, who left Maoriland some time ago
to clean up the women’s golf champion-
ships in Britain, have had a very bad
spin. The latest news of them is that
Miss Kay went down in the Scottish
women’s championship played at Berwick.
Her opponent was Mrs. Coats. Either
the Maorilanders failed to strike form
or else the standard of women’s golf in
Britain is far higher than ours. On this
side of the world Miss Kay was in a
class by herself.
“Indooroopilly”: Queensland women
golfers have been indulging in their
annual jamboree, and the entries re-
ceived in Brisbane, especially from the
country, have beaten all previous records.
The singles champion last year was Miss
Hood, winner for the eighth time, who
defended her title this year. Founded
in 1922 with three clubs, the union has
now 47 on its list.
“Britannia Deserta”: The effects of the
continued drought in Britain are produc-
ing conditions not pleasant to contem-
plate, not the least of them being the
damage done to the golf greens. The
other day the chairman of the London
Water Board roused metropolitan golfers
to a wild Cockney fury by threatening
to cut down the water supply to the clubs
by 10 per cent. He pointed out that
forty million gallons a day was used
in and about London by golf clubs, this
being one-seventh of London s total con-
sumption for all purposes.
Racquet and Bawl
The Australian Davis Cuppers won
through in their semi-final with France,
but, as Wellington said of Waterloo, “It
was ad- d near thing.” The winning
of the doubles meant that only one of
the remaining singles had to be taken for
victory. This time McGrath went down
before Merlin, who seems to have come
on into a champion since last season.
Crawford, after a start which set the
nerves of his supporters on edge, downed
Boussus in five sets. The Parisian bar-
rackers gave a shocking exhibition of
partisanship. The other semi-final was
won by the Czechs, who downed Italy
three to two. Our fellows will have to go
to Prague to meet them, and they are a
tough lot, especially on their home
courts. However, the match will not be
played until Wimbledon is over —some
time before July 16.
“Cut Shot”: Wimbledon drew 118
entries for the men’s singles alone, nearly
every country in the world being repre-
sented. Crawford, who holds the title, is
in the top half, which includes Shields
and Austin. Perry is in the second half,
and with him Von Cramm, Wood and
Stefani, who knocked him out of the
French championships. In the women’s
singles 86 have entered. Helen Jacobs
is ranked first.
“Top Spin”: The tennis world is un-
dergoing reconstruction these days. Nor-
man Brookes has come back with his
proposal to create a Davis Cup Pacific
zone, with Australia, • Maoriland and
South Africa in the south and Japan,
China and the Philippines in the north.
This project dropped out when first ad-
vanced a couple of years ago because
South Africa, which really doesn’t belong
to the Pacific at all, gave the idea a miss.
“I’ve tried swinging from the shoulder. Would you suggest
my swinging a little higher?”
“Yairs —try from the neck.”
Italy and Greece also have come along
with a proposal for a Mediterranean
championship which each country would
control in alternate years. The I.T.F.
threw out the suggestion with all the
emphasis of Demetrius refusing to in-
clude more than one mollusc in a plate
of oyster soup.
“C.C.”: They are playing at Wimble-
don on what is practically an English
equivalent of the alleged Great Austra-
lian Desert. The drought which has
racked Merrie England has led the
average Englishman to sigh for what,
as a beverage at least, he has never
regarded with any favor previously. As
a result, supplies of water for golf, tennis
and cricket grounds have been curtailed
and Wimbledon courts are like an Aus-
tralian ant-bed court with a few whiskers
on it. Worse than that, a new grub,
described as a “leatherjacket,” has started
eating the roots of what grass remains.
The job of locating these creatures and
extracting them individually from the
turf with as little damage as possible is a
greater problem than who will win the
All-England championship.
“Queen’s Club”: Helen Wills-Moody,
who dropped out of big tennis following
on her injury in the American national
championships last year, announced the
other day that she will try to come
back next season. The lady is in London
for Wimbledon and the Davis Cup
matches, and is to write about them.
Recent rulings on the amateur status will
make her a professional unless she can
plead she is a professional journalist.
However, that should be easily fixed, as
it has been on so many other occasions.
Miscellaneous
“Blade Sight”: A fine example of con-
sistency in rifle-shooting must be credited
to F. R. Agate, of Edgecliff (N.S.W.)
club. In an inter-district match at Anzac
range, Agate scored 591 out of a possible
600 at six ranges, from 300 to 900 yards
inclusive.
“Rickety Kate”: The action of the
Australian B.C. in refusing the applica-
tion of Victorian bowlers to be allowed
to invite an American team to Mel-
bourne for the centenary shivoo (B.
20/6/’34) is a pretty instance of snob-
bery. True, the International Bowling
Board will not grant affiliation to the
American B.A. because its players accept
cash prizes, but that does not prevent
American teams being entertained in
Britain and British teams playing in the
States.
“Hotham”: One sign that General
Depresh is retreating is the revival of
polo in several of the States where the
game has been officially on the peg for
some time, Victoria in particular. The
Vies, are staging a Centenary Gold Cup.
and a team of Maorilanders is already
arranging for accommodation for man
and beast, while Honolulu is also discuss-
ing the trip. Queensland and N.S.W. will
be there, and South Australia is sending
two teams, one of them the Mt. Crawford
side.
“The Gaffer”: A couple of new track
records went up the other day, of course
in America, where these things will
happen. Cunningham, of Kansas Uni.,
covered the mile in 4min. 6 7-10 sec.,
beating Maorilander Lovelock’s world
figures of 4min. 7 3-ssec., made in the
States some months ago. Eastman, the
Olympic half-miler, ran the 880 in lmin.
49 8-10 sec., beating his own best by
1 1-lOsec. Lovelock will be captaining
an Oxford-Cambridge team against one
from Princeton and Cornell in July, and
will have a chance of retrieving his lost
laurels. Victoria’s Horsfall will figure
among the Britons in the quarter and the
long jump.
“Spinnaker”: Borrowing a leaf from
Melbourne’s book, Sydney yachtsmen are
adopting the six-metre class, of which we
saw such an attractive specimen as Too-
gooloowoo II on Port Jackson some time
ago. The Melbourne yacht’s plans are
to be adopted as the basis for the Sydney
craft, one of which is already under con-
struction, while several others are spoken
of. The Sydney boats will be modified
for local racing by the addition of a
coach roof and full cabin fittings so as
to permit the use of the craft as a
pleasure cruiser as well as a racer.
“Kick Starter”: The Isle of Man T.T.
races provided another triumph for the
Norton machines, which won in two of
the three classes. J. Guthrie won the
Senior at 78.01 m.p.h. and the Junior at
79.16. The Lightweight went to J. H.
Simpson, who rode a Rudge and averaged
70.81 for the 266-mile spin. Much was
expected of Stanley Woods, winner
of several T.T. races and rated the
best road rider in the world. He
recently left the Norton team to ride
the Husqvarna, a Swedish 348 c.c. two-
cylinder job. He had no success, though
one of his new firm’s machines, ridden
by G. Nott, was third in the Junior event.
W. Balgarnie and Keith Horton, of Vic-
toria, represented Australia in the races,
but neither caught a place, though the
first-named was 13th in a large field.
“Freewheel”: The people running the
Victorian Centenary Thousand wheel-
race are leaving nothing to chance.
Dunlops’ agents in Europe have been
combing the chief European cycling
countries for riders willing to make the
trip and have a shy at the £2500 prize-
money and the Myer Gold Cup. The
route of the race has now been shortened
some 40 miles by cutting out a section
of the last lap from Sale into Melbourne,
making 157 miles and total distance 1069.
The chief hurdle to overcome as
far as Continental riders are concerned
is that the race will be run on a handicap
basis. However, there is plenty of money
going for backmarkers who make good,
and the trouble should be overcome.
“Wick”: The Scotsmen of N.S.W..
Highlander and Lowlander alike, are
hereby warned to present themselves at
Sydney Glaciarium on Monday, July 2.
at 2 p.m., to rejoice in the first curling
match on record betw'een Victorian and
N.S.W. sides. Melbourne already had its
club, and a team is bound for Maoriland
to play at Dunedin. Heroic efforts of
the N.S.W. Highland Society, led by hon.
sec. Geo. Morice, have resulted in the
assembly of a team of N.S.W. curlers to
meet the invaders.

Tullamore Reactions
For about three weeks there had been
noisy rumors in Pitt-street about the
assay values of Tullamore Gold, N.L.,
a concern developing a show in western
N. S. Wales beyond Peak Hill. For
some time there had been steady
bearing. Last Wednesday the Mines
Department reported that assays issued
by the co. in the past —on the strength of
which the 55.-paid shares at one stage
touched 34s. —were “not representative,
and were misleading.”
The C. 1.8. has taken a hand, and deal-
ing in the shares was suspended on
’Change from Wednesday till Friday.
Forward buying in all mining scrip has
been prohibited by the committee.
In the first annual report, published in
February, ore blocked out was estimated
at 11,270 tons, assay values ranging
between 28.4dwt. and 34dwt. A circu-
lar recently issued put the average of all
assays at 31dwt. In a report on develop-
ment up to 15/8/’33 an assay taken by
geologist G. C. Gibson was stated to have
gone 8-ldwt. All of 34 samples taken by
the Mines Department last month have
shown less than 3dwt. gold to the ton.
Later assays made by the directors
and F. H. Jackson, the co.’s consulting
engineer, tallied closely with the official
figures.
If the latest samples show the true
value of Tullamore as a mine, it means
tragic losses for many punters. The
total capital put into the show by
the original shareholders was only
£37,500, but at one stage the market
value was over £200,000, and vestibule
gossip hinted that that figure would be
doubled. It was a front-line stock
amongst N. S. Wales gold shows.
The whole business has been a ghastly
shock to the mining market. On the
other hand, it may imbue speculators
with a little badly-needed caution. A
crash was due to come, though in this
case it came from an unexpected direc-
tion. It is a fact that many mines with
definite prospects ahead of them and
proved values have often been neglected
in favor of developmental gambles. Even
in N. S. Wales, where confidence was
shaken most by the Tullamore dis-
closures, there are concerns that are
actually pulling ore for good returns
which are overlooked in the market.
Idle Men and Idle Money
In respect of the March quarter it was
estimated that around 22 p.c. of Aus-
tralian registered trade-unionists were
unemployed. Certainly that compared
with 26.5 p.c. during the same part of
1933 ; but in 1927 the figure was only
7 p.c.
The figures take no cognisance of un-
employed youth, either. Helped by the
recovery in wool prices and those
secondary industries which were assisted
by exchange and the tariff, we made
definite progress towards re-employment.
But private enterprise and world prices,
together with the restoration of con-
fidence after Lang went out, can take
most of the credit. There has been singu-
lar lack of imagination and energy on
the part of the powers that be in their
efforts to get those on the dole back into
the jobs they understand.
Makeshift jobs on “public works”
seem to be all they can think of. Unless
the “works” pay they add to the tax-
payers’ burden in the long run. The
Bulletin has suggested that, instead of
borrowing for “works,” a programme of
taxation-reduction should be introduced
in order to give private enterprise—the
most useful employer —every chance to
extend business and increase staffs.
Gold-mining has absorbed a large
number of men in Australia, but, though
big sums have been withdrawn from the
investment market and gone into new
gold gambles, a lot of it will never be
put to work. Many new mining shows
won’t get past the testing stage, whereas
thousands of pounds will have passed
through the hands of company pro-
moters and market operators.
The recent scare precipitated by the
crash in Tullamores may emphasise the
wisdom of putting money into new in-
dustrial concerns. New industries are
“Good on yer, dad; but it wasn’t that barrowman that gave me the bad two
bob. It was the bloke over there”
badly needed. Money is as cheap as
it has ever been in the history of the
Commonwealth —which goes to show
how much capital there must be lying
idle.
With land and commodity values and
old debts sadly out of balance, full re-
covery can only come through a rise in
prices or the adjustment of debts. A
recovery in prices would follow an
industrial revival.
Unwilling and Unpaid
Not the least unpleasant feature about
unemployment-relief tax is the means
used to collect it. The private employer,
as collector, has been made the unwilling
and unremunerated agent of the taxation
office. He is the one who has to put up
with any unpopularity aroused through
the incidence of the tax; he is the buffer
between taxpayer and commissioner.
In large businesses collecting these
taxes is a definite expense. Special officers
are employed ; and if tax is not deducted
from the salary or inter-State dividend
payment the onus is on the firm to
account for it.
In N. S. Wales, at least, the statutes
regulating relief tax are extremely com-
plicated. This is particularly so where
inter-State payments have to be made.
It is not unlikely that, to be on the safe
side, a harassed bank official would rule
in favor of the tax commissioner in his
State, and where two State commissioners
are fighting for their grab out of one lot
of income the taxpayer is frequently
overcharged. The bank officer is again
the oppressor —and the scapegoat —as far
as the taxpayer is concerned.
The system has not dispensed with any
civil servants. But an objectionable job,
contrary to all principles of fairness, has
been foisted on to private enterprise by
tyrannous legislation. The burdens of
taxation are enough without the addi-
tional and unrewarded task of doing the
tax commissioner’s work for him under
regulations which are often unfair and
never clear.
From July 1 the maximum overdraft
rate charged by the Bank of N. S. Wales
and the Commercial of Sydney will
be 5 p.c. The associated banks of Vic-
toria restrict their reduction to primary
producers. The new maximum rate is
the lowest ever charged for ordinary
overdrafts in Australia, and compares
with the two-year deposit rate of 2f p.c.
fixed as from last April. The cost of
advances in the Rural Credits Depart-
ment of the Commonwealth Bank, which
is partly subsidised from profits on the
note issue, will be reduced in July from
4 p.c. to 3i p.c.
H= * * *
Sydney food prices at the end of May
were 28.2 p.c. above the July, 1914, aver-
age—34 p.c.. higher than those of any
other Australian capital. Brisbane was
next with a net increase of 24.7 p.c. over
the 20-year period, followed by Mel-
bourne with 23.1 p.c. Perth was nearest
to pre-war levels with 10.9 p.c. During
May there was an average increase of
0.8 p.c. in all capitals over the previous
month’s figures ; Melbourne showed the
biggest upward movement with a* 2 p.c.
rise.

After research costing £1,000,000,
Imperial Chemical Industries is to spend
£2,500,000 on a plant for the hydrogena-
tion of coal at Billingham (Eng.). Capa-
city will be 100,000 tons a year, and the
plant will treat bituminous coal and tar.
Production is expected to begin at the
end of this year; from April, 1935, a
preference will be granted to home-pro-
duced motor spirit by the British Gov-
ernment equal to the difference between
the duty on imported oil and any excise
payable on the home product.
* * * *
Early next month the Liverpool to
Birkenhead tunnel, 170 ft. below the
Mersey (Eng.), will be opened for traffic.
It is two miles long, was started in 1925,
and cost a bit over £7,000,000. The
tunnel is by far the greatest thing of its
kind in the world; it will be able to
cope with 4150 cars an hour. At present
ferries take 15 to 20 minutes to carry
cars across the river; through the tunnel
the journey will be minutes. It has
cost a good deal less than Sydney’s
bridge. Ventilation, one of the biggest
problems, is attended to by giant fans,
fresh air being blown in through the
floor and stale air being drawn off at
the roof.
* * * *
“Wodgil”: Ten or twelve years ago
Perth papers featured advertisements in
which Kalgoorlie house-agents offered to
sell dwellings (wood-and-iron and plain
iron) to south-west and wheat-belt
cookies, delivered on rail to their nearest
station or siding. Photos, of the shacks
were included in the ads., and “firm”
prices quoted ; they ranged from £4O to
£lOO. A brisk trade in portable dwellings
sprang up ; hundreds were shifted from
Kalgoorlie, Boulder and the Mile. Now,
with gold at £8 10s. and wheat down
below 35., Kalgoorlie has a housing short-
age, and many of the cockies would like
to send their purchases back.
*. * * *
Melbourne City Council is nibbling at
a proposal for dealing with its extensive
white elephant the Eastern Market,
which occupies most of a block on the
corner of Bourke and Exhibition streets.
The market’s glories have departed since
the trade drifted to the Western Market,
though there are still bird fanciers,
second-hand booksellers and herbalists
in the vast, rambling enclosure. The
council has been asked to finance a Radio
House, into which the Broadcasting
Commission promises to move its goods
and chatterers. As the area is 300 feet
by 400, an ornate palace of the arts is
in the realm of possibilities, but there
are plenty of councillors who are shy
of the project in the present depleted
condition of the civic cashbox.
%. * * *
“Tops”: Though further official wool
sales have been postponed till August,
Queensland reports a lively trade in
passed-in clips, Japan buying well at prices
which are reckoned to be better than the
cost of a long hangover, with storage
and other charges to meet at the resump-
tion of the sales. Belgium has been tak-
ing some fellmongered stuff, but not as
much as usual, while skin wools have
had quite a good market, the demand
coming from France. There the Mazamet
fellmongers treat wool and hair skins of
all types on a wholesale scale, reselling
to French and foreign millers.
* * * *
“Cru”: Returned travellers are telling
us that Australian wines have already
made a reputation in the United States.
But one danger threatens: it has been dis-
covered that thousands of gallons of in-
ferior American wines are being bottled
and sold as Australian. Send no wine to
America except in bottles? Unfortunately
there are obstacles. Apart from freight
considerations, some wines travel far
better in bulk than in bottle, the heavier
types especially. The genuine ports and
sherries of Portugal and Spain, like the
Madeira product, which is returning to
favor, invariably go to England—their
chief consumer —in bulk. There is no
question about the bottling at the other
end, though Australian producers have
had cause to complain of double-crossing
in the past. On the other hand, it is doubt-
ful whether any of the lighter vintages of
France and Germany now leave their
native land save in bottle, though there
was a time when the so-called “claret”
was shipped in bulk from the Gironde
in large quantities, mostly to Scotland.
We produce some very good wines of
the Medoc and Burgundy type, and, since
they are beverage and not liqueur wines
and are likelier to be in better demand
than the heavier types, these should not
be shipped in bulk.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Anthropologist Forsooth!
“Kaloa”: The Commonwealth’s latest
plan for dealing with the northern native
murderer is to have him tried by “an
anthropologist or some person who has
made a study of aboriginal life and cus-
toms.” In Australia, an anthropologist
is usually a young and academic graduate
who has spent a few months in abo.
camps studying what he conceives to be
local custom and human natural history.
Most of those whom the Minister knows
as having “made a close study of abori-
ginal life” seem to be missionaries.
Under the new ordinance, the appointee
will have the option (denied to the high-
est Judges of the realm) of imposing the
death sentence or not on murderers, and
he will be the arbiter as to whether native
law and custom mitigate the offence.
The basis of his knowledge, since no
tribe has a written law, obviously must
be what the elders and the lubras
tell him, and as they are likely to be
interested parties in cases of true tribal
murder, and as there are a lot of things
from which killing springs which they
dare not tell him for fear of spirit anger,
the lore which he will gather will some-
times be fiction.
Purely tribal murder of whites or Asia-
tics is comparatively rare in the N.T.,
and can be dealt with only by keeping
white men and strangers out of tribal
country or having an experienced dis-
trict officer permanently on the spot. The
kind of black murderer who gives most
trouble is the cheeky, Darwin-educated
boy who has gone bush with an idea that
Fanny Bay is a rest-home, and able to
tell his friends that the worst that is
likely to happen to them if they spear
a policeman is several years under a dry
roof with plenty of good food. The way
to deal with that type of slayer is not to
hand him over to a tender-hearted theor-
ist to try. Too many lives of prospectors
and police are at stake.
“Lancewood”: Mention of the arrival
of James Armstrong, a nonagenarian, in
Queensland in 1864, “long before the
Canoona rush” (B. 13/6/ ’34), post-dates
the discovery of payable gold there. The
rush was in 1858. I know, because my
father, who had spent five unprofitable
years on the goldfields of N.S.W. and
Vic., supplied the needs of the miners by
carrying stores from Rockhampton with
a bullock team. But the gold soon
petered out.
* * * *
“D.E.”: I see one of the Wiluna Co.’s
leases is called the Bulletin (B. 13 /6 / ’34).
Thirty years ago in the same region there
was a Bulletin Hotel, kept by a certain
Webb. Webb was a mate of Henry
Lawson, and used to produce with pride
a copy of verses in which Henry sang
the attractions of the Bulletin Hotel.
Mining camp after mining camp was
snuffed out in the slump which hit
Mulgaland about 1910, and I suppose the
Bulletin Hotel shared their fate.
# # * *
“Buang”: When I was young, Rider
Haggard’s “King Solomon’s Mines” told
of vast limestone caves in which former
African potentates sat preserved for ever
by the action of the dripping water,
which encased them in lime. Now, fact
repeats fiction. One Hall-Best, trekking
from Salamaua to Bulolo (N.G.), is re-
ported to have found large limestone
caves near Mapos. They have evidently
been used as sepultures for centuries
by natives, for hundreds of corpses, well
preserved by dripping limewater, sit in
them, chin on hands and elbows on
knees.
* * * *
“N’lmporte”: Apart from being a well-
regarded medico and an expert on mos-
quito extermination, Phillip Sylvester
Clarke, dead at Cairns, was no mean
ichthyologist, whose opinion was more
than once the deciding factor in a case
of suspected “dynamiting” of Reef fish.
He owned his own fast launches, and it
was his habit to walk out of his consult-
ing-room to be next heard of at Thursday
Island or Cardwell. He knew every fish
on the Reef as few people did, and was
a bait expert whom all fishermen sought.
Once he and some of his family were
wrecked on a Barrier isle for nearly a
week. Their staple diet was watermelon.
* * * *
“Wandana”: North Australia has
many “lost” and skeleton towns. In the
Gulf district, once-flourishing cities
with large populations, Normanton, Croy-
don and Georgetown, are now only
shadows. Of Golden Gate, a town whose
streets the diggers walked in battalions,
there is not even a chimney left. The
old wooden Anglican Church there was
dismantled some time back and sent up
to the Torres Strait islands. Some of
the private houses in these northern
mining towns have big strong-rooms with
fireproof doors, relics of the days when
they served as banks. Somerset, on Cape
York Peninsula, was another place
destined to be an important seaport town.
Survey plans may be seen with streets
duly named. With the exception of the
remains of the old Government Resi-
dency, nothing remains of it.
* * * *
“Malakuna”: Depression has hit primi-
tive man in New Guinea, too —with
rather unexpected and beneficial results.
No longer can he satisfy his passion for
European things, so he is turning back to
the “fashion b’long before.” There is a
revival of the earthen-pot-making indus-
try along the n.-e. coast and of the former
system of barter and exchange, in which
the pots were an important item. This, in
turn, means a more extensive use of
large canoes for the often-hazardous
voyages that primitive trade entails. All
discarded native crafts have benefited ;
Tami Island bowls change hands for pigs
and string bags, and the kela clay pots
are displacing the enamel dish, tin bucket
and iron saucepan of the trade-store that
had supplanted them. In the change
from old to new the people could not, in
face of European contact, retain the old
arts and crafts ; and thus went the old
economic order and its natural occupa-
tions which Providence invented to keep
the Kanaka out of mischief.
H= * * *
“Sailor”: “Papaki” (B. 6/6/’34) says
that the man who treats an abo. or a
Kanaka “like a man or brother” generally
suffers for his pains. It’s not the man
who treats them like fellow-beings who
suffers, but the man who hands out the
sheep-dog treatment —a pat or a kick to
“When did Bill get hurt?”
“Do you know when last ’possum season opened?”
“Yes.”
“Well, he got hurt just after it closed.”
suit his mood. Understanding and kind-
ness will make an abo. or Melanesian a
willing friend. I have worked Kanaka
boat crews and labor lines up to four
hundred men, and in years of experience
I’ve never had more than half a dozen
who wouldn’t give me a fair deal when
treated like sane human beings. A “honey
tongue and a velvet glove” is missionary
stuff, and doesn’t work with black or
white. Anyone handling natives should
begin by forgetting the schoolbook non-
sense about “primitive people.” Some of
them are about as mentally primitive as
a British elder statesman.
* * * *
“Nilotus”: With copra prices gone to
Gehenna planters in New Guinea have
to scratch for a living. The N.G.
Planters’ Association has now launched
an enterprise in the Admiralties which
may mean happier days later. The great
idea was to find out at what rate a
trochus shell grows. On a bare reef
were laid 5000 small trochus shells under
two inches in diameter, between October,
1933, and January, 1934, at the rate of
1200 shells a month. In April, 1934,
over 2000 shells were lifted for inspec-
tion. Some were already up to 3* inches
in base diameter. The lowest measure
was 2J inches, and that for only 505
shells. This means that the trochus,
given favorable conditions, grows much
faster than has hitherto been supposed,
and can be transplanted. That cannot
be said yet of pearl shell, in spite of
many expensive experiments.

“Hambledon”: Who knows how the
first cocoanuts arrived on Barrier Reef
islands, or rather the most common
means of arrival? They did not originate
always in the same manner, nor are they
indigenous ; otherwise all islands might
be expected to bear them. While Green
Island is thickly planted with them, Low
Island has one or two. In the north Hope
Island has none ; neither have the Capri-
corns in the south. Yet all are typical
coral isles of oceanic origin. The most
accepted view is the cocoanuts floating
on the waters have been thrown up and
have germinated ; another theory is that
natives brought them as diet —or as
dessert to help out the diet of enemy
ribs. In a few cases, such as at Aurid
Island in Torres Strait, they were
planted by white traders in civilised times.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Poinsettias blazing against a background of
dull blue curtains enlivened the platform at the
City Hall for the reception to Jean Batten.
The body of the great hall was full, and
crowds lined the approaches to the building.
A bouquet of camellias and Toowoomba
violets was presented to the guest by Mayoress
Jones, and after Mr. Jones and others
had said their words the visitor and a chosen
few were taken upstairs to the Mayoress’s
reception-room, where there were tea and
sandwiches and music. Here a bunch of pink
rosebuds was handed to Miss Batten as a
tribute from two M.L. women.
The rest of the flying girl’s stay was filled
in with a party run by Captain Bird at
Lennon’s, an affair at the Town and Country
Women’s Club (president Merna Gillies usually
manages to gather in any distinguished visitor),
a cocktail gathering at the United Service Club
and dinner at the Bellevue with the Aero
Club.
Roses and poinsettias brightened up the Bris-
bane Women’s Club when Dr. F. M. Robert-
son talked to members of the Authors and
Artists’ Society about prose and verse. The
lecture was punctuated by songs (Mrs. Cowell
gave one, and one came from a youngster
named Harrison with an amazingly good bari-
tone) and recitations by Mrs. L. Wragge.
Merna Gillies played accompaniments. Presi-
dent Stanhope Hobday was assisted by his
wife in receiving the guests. In the audience was
poetess Emily Bulcock, who pinned a deep-red
rose in the collar of her fur coat.
A cameraman provided an impromptu touch
of comedy at the Mater Ball. After care-
fully arranging the debs, and their swains,
Deputy-Governor Blair and his lady, the
Mayoral Joneses, Dr. and Mrs. L. McKillop
and Dr. and Mrs. Windsor in a semicircle, while
the dancers looked on in a roped-off square
behind the group, the poor chap advanced
to press the bulb, tripped, and knocked his
camera flying. With no word, but a very
bitter look, he gathered up his apparatus and
left the stage.
The 28 debs, were charming, and the value
of their coaching at All Hallows’, where they
were taught to curtsy, to manage their trains
and to carry their bouquets properly, was
evident.
Mayoress .Tones, with a stunning wine-red
velvet coat over her black frock, and Mrs.
McKillop, handsome in black velvet and white
fur, were in the group on the platform, where
Archbishop Duhig’s black gown and small
scarlet cap added a picturesque touch. The
legal and medical fraternities were well repre-
sented. One of the most admired matrons was
Mrs. Ainsley Clowes, with her young face
and white hair. Dr. Jim Ryan acted as
escort to his Bachelor of Arts sister Mary, who
looked delightful in black velvet with touches
of turquoise blue. Jim is on the staff of
the Mater Hospital. Barrister John Seymour
danced a lot with his wife, who was radiant
in cream. A draped cream frock also en-
wrapped Mrs. J. Greene, the ex-Mayoress,
whose curtsy to the Deputy-Gov. would have
graced Buckingham Palace.
Red stickers are blossoming among the pic-
tures hung at the Queensland Art Society’s
show. Dr. Jimmy Duhig will carry away
several pictures when the show closes.
Talking of art reminds one that the work of
the late Bill Hart is on view in George-street,
at Celtic Chambers. Mrs. C. Powell is look-
ing after the exhibition, which includes water-
colors and some beautiful black-and-white
sketches. Copies of the book written by
Jessie Stevens, and illustrated by Hart, are on
sale. Some of the leather work is magnificent.
Mrs. Watson, of Tandawanna station, and
daughter Cecily have been in Brisbane doing
some shopping. At the end of the year Cecily
is to wed Jack Dyson. Lola Rouse, of Too-
woomba —her mother was one of the Clen-
dennings, pioneers on the Downs —is to be a
bridesmaid.
The Matrons are busy arranging for their
ball, and a gorgeous affair it is to be. There
will be more debs. —the supply seems inex-
haustible this year—and one of them is to b 1
Cecil Bell. The Bachelors’ Ball also is loom-
ing, but no date has yet been settled for it.
Five young things gave a ball at the Belle
Vue on the same night as the Mater shivoo,
and entertained about 150 guests. The hos-
tesses were Joyce Davies, Noel Stephens, Peggy
Richards and Florence Walker, all of whom
came out last season, and Nancy McWhirter,
who did the unusual thing by being a deb. at
the dance she assisted to launch. She was
complete with bouquet and train, and her
frock of white crepe chevreuse shov/ed a short
cape. All the hostesses wore floral wristlets
as distinguishing badges.
The Morell lady, who seems to be enjoying
the Queensland sun, gave a dinner party at
Lennon’s, and afterwards took her guests to
see “The Gay Divorce.” Brisbane has been
so thankful for a flesh-and-blood show at last
that the theatre has been packed nightly.
Mrs. E. M. Ralph is president of the Anzac
Ball committee, which has decided to have the
hop on August 3, probably at the City Hall,
as a big crowd is expected. There is to be
a bridge party in _ the Mayoress’s reception-
room on July 6 in aid of the' ball fund.
Elwyn, youngest daughter of the late Wal-
ton Kent and of Mrs. Kent, of Toowoomba,
is to face the altar in August with the eldest
son of the A. C. V. Blighs, of Condamine
Plains. The bride-to-be is a member of one
of Queensland’s most prominent. pastoral
families. Bill Kent, of Jondaryan, is a cousin,
and the family for years has been associated
with the progress of the Downs. The young
couple will start off at Bostocks, Brookstead,
near the property held by the paternal Bligh.
Last Thursday Ruth, only daughter of the
Dick Godsalls, was married to Teddy O’Brien,
whose family has had almost as much to do
with the development of the Downs city as
have the Godsall clan. Doreen Hooper
travelled up from Brisbane to act as brides-
maid for her school friend. The newly-weds
went off to Honolulu.
Verna Rudd is to leave soon for New
Guinea, where she is to marry J. Graham.
Her brother Neville gave a party for her at
the Belle Vue.
Mrs. William Davies
and her sister Margaret
Wylie have been spend-
ing some weeks in Bris-
bane. Before they
returned to Melbourne
they gathered up about
100 friends and enter-
tained them at a bridge
afternoon. Poinsettias
and marigolds made the
reception-rooms look
warm and gay, and
autumn leaves and
golden nasturtiums
cheered the tea-tables.
The whole of the
Greater Brisbane area
has been declared a
sanctuary for birds,
beasts and plants, with
the exception of de-
clared pests. So the
tripper who leaves
newspaper oddments
and scraps of food at
the scene of his picnic,
and then roots up and
carries away ferns and
flowering shrubs, will find his style cramped.
Ruth Portrate is spending a few weeks in
Brisbane with her people before she joins the
Fuller Opera Co. in Melbourne. Nearly four
years ago the Queensland girl left for Eng-
land. After a course of study she struck a
job with the Carl Rosa Co. and toured Eng-
land.
The Gavan Duffys are spending a few quiet
days in Brisbane at the Belle Vue. Their
son, Father Guy Gavan Duffy, is with them,
and the whole family is waxing enthusiastic
about the Queensland sun and the beauty of
the gardens. On most afternoons the lady is
to be found with a group of old friends gath-
ered round her, sipping tea and exchanging
reminiscences.
Tom Stephens and Babette Ferguson,
members of the Repertory Society, have
announced their engagement. This is the first
serious romance that has blossomed in the
society, and members are very interested. The
wedding is to be at the end of December.
Mrs. Hannah Culpin, wife of Dr. Millice
Culpin, snr., and mother of Dr. Ernest Culpin,
Brisbane, and Dr. Millice Culpin, England,
also of Miss D. E. Culpin, principal of Fair-
holme College, Toowoomba, and Mesdames
J. H. Simonds and P. Campbell, died last week.
She was 86, and had been in Queensland since
1890, when she and her husband came from
England. In March the pair celebrated the
65th anniversary of their wedding. One son,
the youngest, was killed in France.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Paddington Town Hall has undergone
beauty treatment. It now has creamy
walls, fluted pillars that run almost to
the ceiling, flattering lighting and high-
set loges. The United Service Institution
was the first to fall to its lure, and staged
its ball to the Randle Fords in the old
building that in past years always shel-
tered the military shivoos.
Flags draped the balconies of the loges
and the coat of arms over the door ; the
orchestra alcove, arranged as the deck of
Canberra, flew the Admiral’s. Blue and
red mess-jackets added to the color of
the night. Brigadier-General Phillips and
his wife —her frock was the shade of
Maori greenstone—received the guests,
who arrived on a fanfare of trumpets.
Joan Henning and Margaret Allen made
their curtsy to the Admiral’s lady, whose
lime-green moires flew a stiffly-befrilled
cape. Col. and Mrs. Spain were among
the dancers; so were the Captain
C. J. Pope couple, a huge taffeta bustle
bow finishing the waist of her black
taffetas. Mrs. Hector Clayton wrapped
her shoulders in a poinsettia-red velvet
scarf; otherwise she was Patou pink.
Mary McGowan’s burgundy velvets had
diamente shoulder-straps. Mrs. Harold
Vale wore Chanel-blue crepes. The
Mayoral lady came on from another
ball, and the Feakes couple after listening
to “Elijah.”
The Rotarians are good friends to
lame children. They adopted them about
four years ago, and it was through
Rotary’s interest that the present N.S.W.
Society for Crippled Children came into
being. This year 1300 overflowed D.J.’s
ballroom and danced so that the coffers
might be filled. The Lieut-Governor
and his lady came to the party, her
black brocaded velvets an ideal back-
ground for the presentation posy of deep-
red roses. The Julius lady murmured
the names of the six debs., and Rotary
president J. S. Duncan brought his wife
in long-sleeved anemone-pink satins and
young daughter Joan with puff sleeves
on her blue crepes and blue flowers in
her hair. The knightly Tom Bavins
(he’s president of the C. C. Society),
Mrs. Muscio and Dr. R. B. and Mrs.
Wade were in this group. Valerie Bavin
trailed long-sleeved lupin-blue laces
with an all-round high neckline, embel-
lished in front with a spray of white
hyacinths.
Among her treasures the Lieut.-Gov-
ernor’s wife has now a de luxe volume of
Lawson’s poems; the Rotarians gave
it to her at their ball. It has a
beautiful hand-tooled leather binding.
Percy Leason’s drawings enrich its pages,
and the club’s metal badge is inset on
the back of the attractive morocco-
leather case that holds the gem. The
debs., too, each got something to re-
member the night by—a dainty pearl
bracelet.
Nobody waited for Premier Stevens to
open the Sheep Show ; they just started
to go on Thursday and kept on going on
each of the three days. The show gets
more fascinating every year. After say-
ing its yearly “Hullo” to the merinos this
Letter was introduced to the English
breeds, and found there isn’t a possibility
of pulling any wool over their eyes.
The two women exhibitors got prizes.
Joyce Dawkins, of S. Aus., wasn’t visible,
but Jean Harrison was seen quite early
on judges’ day, polishing up the coat of
her shorn ewe. By 11 a.m. each day
women in smart tweeds and luxurious
furs were leaning over pens, reading cata-
logues and watching the judging, many
seeming to know as much about the
matter as their male escorts. Mrs. Eric
Campbell talked with her father, William
Brown, who hails from Young; Joan
Austin, of Hay, was glimpsed, and
Katherine Body, very excited over
father’s rams having carried off the grand
champion ribbons, kept her mother com-
pany.
The sheep-dog trials also had their
audience. The dogs are lovely things.
They watch and follow the movements of
the trainer’s hand as closely as members
of an orchestra follow the conductor’s
baton. Here the spectators were of the
matey order, and called out to each other
across benches criticisms of the men put-
ting the dogs through their paces—never
of the dogs.
Phillipa Stephen and Margaret Allen,
very trig in jodhpurs and brown tailored
jackets, acted as mounted line officials
on the opening day of the N.S.W. Polo
Association tournament. Seldom in the
Australian history of the game has the
weather been so perfect. And, although
everyone came prepared for the worst, in
the way of rugs and wraps, they enjoyed
the best, and Kensington was soon a
blaze of reds, yellows and blues in cos-
tume, scarf and coat. Mrs. Jimmy Ash-
ton, not yet able to walk without
crutches, watched her sons play, and was
one of the many picnic-tea hostesses.
Mrs. Venour Nathan’s caped suit of
mulberry velvet sported a very upstand-
ing collar. Melbourne girls Valerie
Purves and Catherine Ramsay were in-
terested onlookers, Valerie’s tam-like hat
flaunting a flaming pompom. Mrs.
Gordon Brady was there, and Brays and
Finlays gathered in force. Camden
medical Crookstons brought daughter
Suzanne in a green velour hat and
daughter Jacqueline hatless.
There are a friendliness and a we-all-
know-each-other air about' R.S.P.C.A.
dances that make them enjoyable. Always
the hall is decorated with posters of dogs
and cats and other domestic animals.
Of this year’s absurdities, Audrey Rus-
sell’s panel of monkeys forming the
initials of the society was the most divert-
ing. Under it the Lieut.-Governor and
his lady held court, three pink gardenias
lending a touch of color to her platinum
laces. President W. Acocks and Mrs.
Acocks and the Commander Farncombe
couple stood by, the first lady wearing
black with distinction, the second trailing
jade-green velvets topped with a pleated
cape that spread fanlike as she moved.
White hyacinths were the favorite flower ;
Mollie Street pinned many sprays of
them on the corsage of a black-and-gold
lace gown that ended in billows of tulle
about her feet. Organising secretary Miss
Compton Legge’s gold earrings were very
long, of great beauty and great age.
Jean Marie Adams married her Vin-
cent John Flynn at St. Mary’s, which
was decked with hyacinths and lilies, on
a fine morning of last week. Rector of
St. Aloysius’s, Father Kelly, had to catch
an early boat to town to be in time to
do the knot-tying. Magnolia satin cut
on mediaeval lines sheathed the bride,
who was further adorned by a veil of
Honiton lace, draped Madonna fashion
about her head, and a sheaf of arum-
lilies. All honey-gold velvet from head
to toe was her sister, Mrs. James Flynn,
the only attendant. There were rejoic-
ings afterwards at Holyrood, the Strath-
field home of the bride’s parents.
Charlie Westmacott got back to Syd-
ney last week after doing the rounds of
the capital cities, making listening-in a
pleasure to the radio enthusiast. At the
moment he is enjoying the delights of
the country as decanted by his friends
the Venour Nathan couple at their
Bowral stronghold.
This pencil drawing has for its sub-
ject Elizabeth Conlon, one of Sydney’s
clever young sculp-
tors. Hobart Tech,
was her first work-
room, and director
Dechaineux found
her work so good
he enlisted her help
on the Hobart
Memorial. Later
she came to Syd-
ney, and studied
under Ray n e r
Hoff, in whose
studio she has now
worked for six
years. At the
moment her
thoughts and
hands are busy on
the Anzac Mem-
orial. The South
Australian Mem-
orial is another on
which Elizabeth
has left her mark,
under the direction
of Mr. Hoff.
As many unin-
vited as invited
guests went to St.
James’s, all joyous
with poinsettia and
sweet-peas to see
the wedding of Rita
Buckland. The
bride, who was
given away by her
brother, wore a
princess gown of
magnolia satin which drew in its
wake a court train lined with Patou-
blue taffeta, its corners embellished with
true-lovers’ knots in forget-me-nots and
orange-blossom. The veil of old-rose
point lace fell in soft folds from a slim
wreath of the same flowers. In the
bouquet were tuberoses, white hyacinths
and lily-of-the-valley. Picturesque and
gravely intent on the job in hand was
the trainbearer, little Dawne Stranghorn,
in poke bonnet and toe-length ruched
pink taffetas. There were five ’maids,
two rustling Patou-blue and three Chanel-
pink taffetas, and bride’s sister (Mrs.
Doris Clayton), as matron of honor,
walked in softest blue sprayed with silver.
All wore halo hats in silver lame, knotted
about with a ribbon the shade of their
dress. The ’groom, Captain C. W. C.
Thompson, wore uniform. So did his
male supports and many of the guests.
After the wedding the waiting crowds
outside got their thrill. The flashing arch
of steel reached to the door of the car,
and, before the guests had emerged, the
wedding chariot had been drawn by 13
uniformed soldiers to the Australia. Here
the wedding feast was spread, and toasts
were drunk by 150 guests.
The A.B.C. symphony concerts ended
in a blaze of glory. The Town Hall was
filled to overflowing, and the dressing
was as expensive as on the other three
nights. The Apostolic Delegate (or
“Delicate,” as one little tot calls him),
Monsignor King, and Dr. Giles were the
guests of the Commission, and sat in
the Clock Gallery along with the C. L.
Joneses and Major Conder. At the end,
when the applause quietened down and
he could make himself heard, a limp but
happy-looking Sir Hamilton Harty
thanked the people for their support, and
praised the orchestra for their hard work
and co-operation. When the hall emptied
itself, he slipped away quietly to the
broadcasting studios, and over a dish
of tea with Major Conder listened-in to
the cricket.
There’s no doubt about Will Ashton’s
ability to “draw a house.” The crowds
that besieged the Macquarie Galleries on
the first day of his all-Australian exhibi-
tion proved it, and Arthur Stigant’s open-
ing speech proved that his knowledge of
painting doesn’t end with the pigments
used in facial make-up. Mrs. Ashton
wore a collar of cheekah on her
brown coat. Mrs. Stigant was serene
in black. Among the onlookers were
the medical Huff Johnstons and the
Charles Reids. Dr. Gordon Pait brought
his sister. Mrs. W. H. Mackay, Dora
Jarrett and Melbourne’s Valerie Purves
were an attractive trio.
The infant son of Lieut.-Commander
and Mrs. Oliver had an unusual christen-
ing the other day. It took place on
H.M.A.S. Penguin ; padre Tulloh, of
the flagship, officiated, and the bell of
the Adelaide was used as a font. The
christening cake was a work of naval art,
being topped by a baby slung in chain-
hooks.
The central figure was guarded by his
two sisters, and his correct deportment
was admired by his god-parents, Lieut.-
Commander and Mrs. Blacklock, Engi-
neer-Commander and Mrs. Doyle, Lieut.-
Commander and Mrs. Mackenzie, Drs.
Gibson and Hughes and their wives and
other family friends.
The Limbless Soldiers’ Assoc, and the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital benefit
by Vacuum Oil’s dance. “Major
Plume” was prominent in the decora-
tions, but the co.’s gargoyle was
the central figure. There were 700
dancers, and those who wished could
have a peep at the pedigree pom. which
was the prize for the guessing competi-
tion. All the highlights of the co., includ-
ing general manager H. B. Cowles and
his wife, came to the party. To sec.
Bonnie Harrington was due much of its
success.
The widow of Major-General Wil-
liams, who was Director-General of our
army medical services for many years,
arrived in Sydney from England last
week and is staying with her sister-in-
law Mrs. Monte Severn. Both the Wil-
liams children have made successes of
their life. Gwen, whom Sydney remem-
bers as a pretty flapper, is now a pro-
minent Elstree figure. She began as a
film actress, and then turned to directing.
When she arrives here to produce talkies
for foreign as well as local consumption,
she will bring British artists with her ;
the bulk of her acting talent, however,
she expects to find in Australia. Her
brother has had a distinguished career
in the Indian Army and now commands
a battalion.
Mrs. Monte Severn gave a party for
her guest at Alplington on Sunday, and
various members of the Steven family
turned up, including the Supreme Court
Judge, who, by reason of his official
position, is regarded as the local head
of the vast clan.


Melbourne
Chatter
The injury to a jockey and the death
of Gravelines in the Wanda Steeplechase
were dark splodges upon Saturday at
Caulfield. Otherwise the day was per-
fect, the sun shone and there was no
wind to disarrange carefully-groomed
locks. Everybody wore flowers, the most
popular being orchids or violets. Mrs.
William Mann, of California, had her
posy mixed with synthetic gold berries ;
she was in black, with bunches of fur
trimming her sleeves from shoulder to
elbow. Escorting this U.S.A. visitor was
Mrs. Norman Robinson, whose bucca-
neer headpiece was tamed with a neat
pulled-forward movement, and whose
silver fox carried a spray of lily-of-the-
valley. Mrs. Percy Blackbourn’s black hat
carried a green wing, and under her suit
was a blouse whose stripes ran at cross
purposes. Mrs. Forbes Mackenzie was
wrapped in a fur coat and a little brown
velvet hat. Mrs. Massey Burnside’s black
coat had a notion for slimness with rows
of darts down the back. Elaine Pearce
wore her panther jacket, and Peggy
Ahern was dressed in a tweedy manner.
The opening of Parliament happened
on a freezing grey afternoon. Early
arrivals got the best seats, the 2.30-ish
ones having to stand. One woman proved
a distraction by hoisting herself on to a
precarious footing on a ledge and twist-
ing herself uncomfortably round a pillar.
Until the arrival of Lord Huntingfield’s
retinue, Major R. T. A. McDonald’s
medals and twinkly buttons were the
brightest spots in the Council Chamber.
The Hon. Sara Vanneck made her firsjt
public appearance since her attack of ap-
pendicitis. The Mayor, in his grey stock,
and his lady, in her scarlet coolie hat,
gave a thrill to a Salvation Army lassie
by sitting in the same row with her.
After the brief formalities members took
their friends on a tour of the huge and
rambling building, up to the roof, down
to the catacombs, through rooms where
merry old men cracked jokes round
crackling fires, through offices stuffed to
the ceiling with papers. Visitors who
had no cicerone stumbled into a Cabinet
meeting by mistake or found the
Speaker’s room, where the owner had,
with relief, parked his wig.
In the library one came face to face
with the Speaker’s mother, Mrs. Black-
burn, wearing her amethyst necklace.
Wending their way through cold passages
were Premier Argyle and his wife, she
tall and trim in a tailored suit and silver
foxes. The Peacock lady, in a black
suit, hit the trail for her sanctuary with
its view of traffic and wet green lawns ;
lingering in the company of a radiator
were Mrs. Austin Embling and Mollie.
By every men’s group octogenarian G.
M. Prendergast was hailed with “Hullo,
young George! ” Tea and ices were
served aloft in the usual dining-room,
and, judging by the prevailing odor, the
law-makers were to have onions for
dinner.
Guests who travelled to Ranelagh for
the club dance found three blazing fires
ready to chase away the numb effect of
a cold drive. In between dances every-
body got into coats ; in fact, some people
counteracted shivers by actually dancing
in their wraps. Mrs. Jack McComas
wore a dull-surfaced black dress with
a scarlet organdie coatee all primped up
with frills to match her scarlet slippers.
A cunning arrangement of straps fas-
tened Mrs. Cal Hoyt’s purple cape. Mrs.
Jack Goulding wore a halo band of
sweet-peas in her hair, and a gown of
cyclamen-pink. Three lilies hung from
a single stalk upon the up-to-the-throat
neck of Penelope Stead’s green velvet.
Mollie Hawke’s chiffons were whisked
with green and white, and Margaret
Cockran’s pale-pink satin revolted at its
tubular narrowness by bursting into petal
frills in the region of the knee. Mrs.
Pat Cahill’s ice-blue taffetas were a
mooring ground for cartwheel sleeves of
white organdie. Frills down the back
and handful of blue-and-green leaves
were blown upon Mrs. Harold Herbert’s
chiffons.
Though the International Club’s after-
noon last week was less crowded than
usual (the telephone had rung all the
morning with regrets from victims of
colds) there were eleven nationalities re-
presented. Mrs. E. C. Dyason wore an
elegant and utility combination of black
suit and oyster satin blouse, a spray of
amber pansies being a feminine touch
to counterbalance her severe “postilion”
hat. “The Russian Background as I Saw
It” was the subject of her lecture, which
transported listeners by haphazard rail-
ways through Petrograd and Moscow
down to the Ukraine. So lacking is
Intourist in a sense of punctuality that
if a train is on time you know it is
yesterday’s, running late. Special guests
of the afternoon were Miss E. Haffer-
berg, Madame Mima Heseleva and Dr.
Patkin. Madame has no desire to re-
visit her native country. She escaped
12 years ago in the clothes she wore,
carrying only some precious music and
a few hidden jewels.
Mrs. Borhaven was there with sketches
of Nansen and Ibsen; she’s searching
for men to interpret her countrymen at
the International Centenary Pageant.
Mrs. Mortill is also on the pageant com-
mittee ; she’s wondering how to be tact-
ful over the Russian flag. Others present
included Mrs. Krisog; a Polish repre-
sentative, Madame de Tarczynska, and,
from Greece, Mrs. Nicholades and Mrs.
Raftopolous.
The Educational Committee of the
Victoria League arranged an entertain-
ing evening at the League’s domicile,
with Dudley Glass and his talk on “The
Story of Opera” as chief attraction. Mr.
Glass struck out with “Once upon a
time there was a child called Opera”....
and sustained interest by sparkles of
humor and illustrative gramophone
records. He always has an answer ready.
Someone begged a hint on how to write
an opera. Dudley said first you get an
inspiration, then you get a libretto, then
you go ahead. Another spokesman with
a glib tongue was H. W. Allen. The
Masson lady offered a vote of thanks.
The eye travellling round the room en-
countered a monotony of black, for to
be sombre in dress or wrap seemed the
inclination of every woman present. Mrs.
Arthur Hordern’s beautifully waved
head was noticeable. The Mackey lady,
in a lame coat over black, brought Beth,
whose upstanding halo plait was poised
above black matelasse. One vivid splash
was Mrs. Fred Thiel’s poinsettia, pinned
to the sable collar of her Persian lamb
coat, and another was a nimbus of green
under Mrs. F. W. Faulkner’s black Per-
sian lamb. Mrs. D. H. Dureau was well
wrapped up among her minks. In the
absence of Lucy Rowe, Mrs. J. A. Gunn
carried on the job of secretary.
The profile belongs to a clever girl,
Giselle Steinle, who has come out to
Melbourne to join her mother and sister
Lorie. Giselle was educated in Switzer-
land, where she wound up her schooling
by gaining a diploma for eurhythmies.
In Hanover she collected more diplomas
for German dancing and physical cul-
ture, and at the institute of Dr. Bess
Mensendieck she did a special course
of beauty culture, which included two
and a half years’ study of anatomy and
physiology. A new development of Dr.
‘Mensendieck’s work is a clinic started
by her pupil Doris Reichmann for the
scientific exercising of babies from the
age of three months. Miss Steinle studied
at the clinic, which has been in existence
long enough to show what well-made
children the exercised babies grow into.

The army people are expressing re-
grets in various ways at the transfer-
ence of Captain and Mrs. J. E. Barrett
to Newcastle (N.S.W.). At a dance in
the drill hall, officers of the 15th Brigade
presented Mrs. Barrett with a silver tray
—Jackie got only drinks and thumps on
the back, for when he marries and when
he retires are the only occasions when
a man in the services may accept pre-
sentations from his brother officers. For
Rip (mostly Airedale) there was a large
and succulent bone tied with the bat-
talion colors. This has since been
gnawed, buried and exhumed, and will
be polished and engraved to occupy a
niche of honor among Captain Barrett’s
trophies in his Newcastle smoke-room.
To the dance Mrs. Barrett wore white
matelasse. Colonel Morshead’s wife
came wrapped in black lace.
Recent good-byes for the popular
couple included a cocktail-mixing given
by Colonel and Mrs. Williams, bridge
parties at the homes of Major and Mrs.
E J. Milford, Captain and Mrs. A. J.
Boase and Captain and Mrs. B. J.
Andrew. Afternoon shivoos for Mrs.
Barrett were handed out by Mrs. Cruik-
shank, Mrs. John Corby, Mrs. D.
Crombie, Mrs. Alan Steele and Mrs. G.
R. L. Adams. On the 30th the couple
hope to leave at crack of dawn by road.
To show their appreciation of the
home-coming of daughters D’Arcy and
Judith, the W. S. Lawrys gave a cock-
tail party on the late afternoon of the
day of the Monterey’s arrival. The girls
have spent several months travelling in
the U.S.A. with their grandmother, Mrs.
W. S. Lawry, of Sydney. D’Arcy’s
powder-blue suit with its three-quarter
coat went with a navy taffeta blouse and
flat little hat. Judith was in turquoise, and
Mrs. Lawry’s patterned georgettes peeped
through apertures in a nonchalant coat
of Afghan-brown. Guests included the
lan Haywoods, of Adelaide, Mrs. Nor-
man Robinson and an American girl,
Janet Jackson, who were among travel-
lers on the Monterey.
The Joy Bells Ball for the orthopaedic
section of the Children’s Hospital has
always been held on the first Monday in
July; this year the date falls on the
second. Pictured here by Jack Cato, with
her neck snug in the silver fox, is the
organiser, Mrs. Wallace Mitchell. Every
year she gives a Christmas-tree to the
Orthopaedic Hospital at Frankston. And
each Christmas her presents increase in
numbers, for in place of the 32 children
of four years ago there are now 88. Mrs.
Mitchell is the mother of seven sturdy
young Australians.
Bendigo has been buzzing with excite-
ment over the sale of the old Lansell
home, Fortuna. Buyers collected from
as far afield as N’Yark and S’Africa;
dealers were there in swarms, and the
modest individual who had hankered
after a rug or a piece of crystal was
quite out of her depth in such experi-
enced company. There were 2600 lots,
one an 1885 Paris Exhibition bedroom
suite, all brass, glass and claret-colored
curtains, which cost 880 guineas. The
bed weighs Bcwt., and the person who
wakes up in its massive depths is plunged
straight from dreams into a limpid Lake
Como in oils. Another suite overflowed an
enormous room with satinwood in Shera-
ton design. The reception-rooms were so
stuffed with furniture that with the
crowds surging through them there was
scarcely room to breathe. Europe is
the destination of the garden statues, and
a foundling home will acquire the chil-
dren’s see-saw. It is fitted with special
gadgets to regulate weight and keep the
youngsters from falling off. The pic-
tures will be exhibited and sold in Mel-
bourne Town Hall in August.
The sale lasted a week, and every day
there were a dozen police to keep an
eye on things generally. The auctioneer’s
hammer and “going, going, gone”
marked time with the “thump, thump” of
the battery on the mine, for George Lan-
sell built his home on the site where he
made his fortune. But for the tall trees
planted 50 years ago, the view from For-
tuna would be a drab expanse of dumps
and tin roofs.
Bonnie Byrne and Ainslie Meares
decided to vary the fashion of afternoon
weddings and sought an evening blessing
from the Rev. C. Wood in Melbourne
Grammar School chapel. The bride’s
parchment satin gown stood an invasion
of rucking upon its train and on its
sleeves from elbow to wrist, and, plucked
from a few centuries ago, a Medici collar
of Brussels lace stood up stiffly upon the
V-necked corsage. The shower bouquet
was a mingling of azaleas, white camellias,
orchids and lily-of-the-valley. Bride’s
sister Bessie, Barbara Shields, Jule
Kiddle and Joan Macrae were a four-
some of ’maids in moonstone-blue satin.
Around their shoulders were wisps of
tulle capes, their heads were coroneted
with lame bandeaux and their hands were
hidden among delphiniums, wallflowers
and pansies. Confetti flew at No. 9.
The doings of Adelaide:
At the Uni. ball, 20 debs, were presented to
Lieut. Governor Murray, who had to face the
galaxy of beauty unsupported, his sister, Miss
Murray, being down with ’flu. The difficulty
of making a graceful bow in a skin-tight frock
was demonstrated by the debs. R. R. P.
Barbour (president of the Uni. Sports Assoc.)
received the guests with his wife, who wore
blue and white patterned organdie. Lud Mayor
Cain was there with his daughter, Mrs. H.
Dunstan, the lady in black lace veiling silver
tissue, edged with a ruche of black silk.
Douglas Mawson’s lady was a striking figure
in black marocain relieved with gold lame.
The Uni. Dance* Club held a hop in the
refectory, which was decorated with autumn
flowers. The joint presidents, Dr. and Mrs.
Rex Matters, received the guests, Mrs. Matters
wearing a smart white silk figured in black, with
a red corsage spray. Several of the profs, and
their wives shed the light of their presence,
and gathered round the huge log fire at the
end of the room. Mesdames Wilkinson and
Williams both chose black chiffon velvet. Mrs
Pennycuick wore Lido-blue silk lace. Mrs. A.
E. V. Richardson was gowned in black and
silver. Her guest, Miss Fleming-Dunstan, of
Melbourne, was in green georgette with frills
of black lace.
At the R.S.A. headquarters the Legion of
Frontiersmen entertained Mrs. W. Dollman and
members of the women’s committee of the
recent ball. Major T. Griffiths handed Mrs.
Dollman a silver cake dish on behalf of the
Legion, and Rosalie Dollman received a crystal
necklace donated by Colonel A. K. Wendt,
for having sold a record number of tickets.
Mrs. Geoffrey Angas Parsons, of Pewsey
Vale, invited a number of girl friends to her
home for bridge and afternoon tea. The guests
made a motor picnic of the outing and lunched
by the wayside en route. The recent bride,
wearing a smart frock of black matelasse,
received her guests in a drawing-room fragrant
with roses.
The Housewives’ Association commenced
Housewives’ Week by visiting Seppeltsfxeld,
where they sampled the wines and were enter-
tained at luncheon.
Fom the West:
Architectural students and fully-blown plan-
drawers gathered at the Embassy for the
T-square Ball. Deputy-Governor Mitchell and
his lady put in an appearance, her beige laces
semi-concealed with musquash and followed by
Miss Kidson’s Wedgwood-blue silks. Knight
Talbot Hobbs joined the v.-r. party with
daughter Betty, who was enmeshed in honey
laces. The Waldie Forbeses were in the
official circle, and Cedric Evans wore the
A.D.C. cloak.
M.L.C. Old Girls trod a somewhat congested
measure at the Y.A.L. Hall, the floor being
crowded. Early wattle made a bright splash in
the supper-room, and balloons, caps and what-
nots cheered the ball-room. Principal Gertrude
Walton pressed presentation roses against
trailing black Chantillies; president Lorna
Dickson’s auriferous earthy browns would have
gladdened the eye of a prospector; Lorna
Booth did secretarial duties in clinging moon-
light blues; Joan Harford scintillated silver
sequins on coral radio crepe; May Camm
swished floral taffetas in tutumn tones, and
Betty Luce ran a silver stripe down her sapling-
green matelasse.
Strindberg’s “The Father” made his bow to
audiences for a couple of nights at the Little
Theatre. Roger Merrybridge carried the brunt
of the work in the name part and made the
character appear feasible. Verna Jones played
the ruthless wife, and Melva Bartlett did well
in the strait-jacket scene of the last act.
Mary Forrest sipped her way into citizen-
ship with a 4 to 7 o’clock party at her parents’
home. Mrs. John Forrest met the flowing tide
of guests with a smile above navy-blue geor-
gettes,- and Mary ranged her brown Angoras
alongside sister Elsie’s red-and-white-flecked
marine blues. Molly Mahood stepped from a
mailboat to the party in time to announce
her engagement to Charles McGlew, of Seaton
Ross, Beverley.
Joy Fordham and Heather Coalstead hostessed
the Pleiades Club’s musical evening. The club
choir, trilling its initial song under the baton
of Max Rutter, met with approval, and splo
items were roundly applauded.
S.A.’s Moulden lady said au revoir to Perth
with cocktails shaken at the Savoy. The ball-
room flaunted poinsettias, wattle and Geraldton
wax, with milady at the entrance nestling a
posy of violets at the shoulder of her long
black velvet coat. Guests were asked to turn
back the hands of time 25 years and re-celebrate
the hostess’s coming-of-age.
The Speck speaking:
To provide prizes in mathematics and Eng-
lish the women graduates held a bridge party
in the A.W.N.L. rooms. Olive Mahoney and
Merle Weaver did the honors, and Uni. folk
and their friends turned out in strength. The
McPhee lady was congratulated by all on her
husband’s knighthood. She was president.
Edith Eleanor, youngest daughter of the J.
J. Coupes, Prospect-place, and John Barton
Salmon were married at St. John’s Baptist
Church. The bride’s frock of heavy ivory
satin was sent out from London by her aunt,
Mrs. Casely. The neckline was cowlish in
front and descended in a deep V at the back.
Winifred Coupe and Joan Salmon attended in
deep apricot frocks, with copper sashes of
ring velvet falling in long ends at the side, and
two small attendants were in organdie of the
same deep yellow, with copper sashes. Festi-
vities followed at the bride’s former home.
Launceston Players brought their last show,
Milne’s “Fourth Wall,” to the Hobart Theatre
Royal, and produced it for the benefit of the
Child Welfare Association. Dr. W. K. Mcln-
tyre acted: his wife was producer.
Many farewell parties were given in honor
of Mary Johnson, of Launceston, before she
left to be married in Berlin. Her mother,
Mrs. Landon Fairthorne, hostessed a sherry
party, and there was a cocktail party at the
Brisbane, where Berenice O’Brien was hostess.
A bridge and handkerchief party was given
by Beverley Evans at Ivanhoe, and a com-
mittee of the bride-elect’s friends gave a dance
at the Bridge Club’s rooms.
Mrs, Wordsworth is in Hobart on a visit
to her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ross Reynolds,
to cool off in her native air after the climate
of India. She brings her small son.

HE.E.NZO
as a money-saving
remedy for chest and

ďfgsdfgsdfgsdfgd
Here’s a wonderful money-saving recipe for a family cough mixture that is equally good for
children and adults, and is far better than the usual made-up cough mixture you could buy. Order
from your chemist or store a two-shilling bottle of concentrated HEENZO. Add the Heenzo to
sweetened water, according to the easy directions on the bottle, and you will have a supply equal
to eight ordinary-sized bottles of the usual ready-mixed cough remedies that would cost up to £l.
Heenzo does NOT contain any poisons or harmful drugs. Therefore, it can be given with perfect
safety to the youngest baby. You will be delighted with the speedy way HEENZO soothes sore
throats, eases the chest, and banishes coughs, colds, croup, influenza, bronchitis, and whooping
cough. Always have Heenzo ready in the home for the first sign of a cough or cold. Remember,
an ounce of prevention is better than a ton of cure.
Every Leading Chemist and Store in Australia sells

THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
The Abolition Party
Its programme is: (1) Abolition of
State Governments ; (2) rehabilitation of
the youth of Australia, who are the future
of Australia and the first line of defence.
I appeal for funds to support the Aboli-
tion party. All funds will be acknow-
ledged through the various newspapers
[but not this one]. —J. A. D. (N.S.W.).
Appreciation
I received your letter containing infor-
mation re our dynamo and the motor
required to drive it. Your Service De-
partment must be one of the finest infor-
mation services in the world. I could
not have received better, more compre-
hensive or more practical advice had
I seen a consulting engineer—and it
costs nothing. It has borne out my firm,
and often-expressed, opinion that The
Bulletin is the one paper that has not
become a habit, but is eagerly looked to
each week. —O. W. H. (Q.).
Looking After the Lads
Westralia is doing it per medium of a
Boys’ Employment League. Up to May
13, 3624 lads had been placed in posi-
tions, 2700 in the country. As these lads
went to individual farmers, there were
virtually 2700 volunteer tutors for 2700
lads, who were paid wages and keep
while they learned. Leaving out the pro-
duction-value of each lad, the saving in
sustenance is reckoned at £46,800. This
work was accomplished by a staff which
averaged under two, plus the services
of a volunteer. —F. T. C. (W.A.).
School-teachers’ Pay
“Dominie’s” arguments (B. 16/5/’34)
are stale to me. I heard them in South
Aus. in 1916, when I
started teaching on £BO
a year. They are say-
ing the same things
now, though salaries
are almost double and
living costs almost half
(never mind your in-
dex figures; I know
what I paid for clothes
then and what I pay
now). As for the type
of person attracted to
the profession, there is
not, taking it on the
whole, much difference.
He or she who wishes
to teach will not drive a plough, or
draw teeth, or sell might-be-silk under-
wear. And it is a significant fact
that there are more applicants than
jobs in the Education Departments in
all the States. — Cabberlie (S.A.).
Amend the Criminal Laws
I feel sure that every thoughtful per-
son who has read it will warmly approve
of your able article “Shall Killers Go
Free?” (B. 20/6/’34). There is no
shadow of doubt that our criminal laws
are far behind the times, and urgently
require amendment.
I suggest that there should be a con-
ference of Attorneys-General and chiefs
of police to go thoroughly into the ques-
tion and to frame a bill that would make
these laws up to date and uniform
throughout all the States. As one who
has had long experience in political life,
I believe Mr. Stevens will find that the
Governments of the other States will be
only too glad to fall into line —T.
Waddell (N.S.W.).
Dental Board and Dentists
The N.S.W. Dental Board has asked
Parliament to grant to it the powers of
a royal commission. It already has the
powers of prosecutor and Judge as far
as the individual dentist is concerned,
and if it thinks police assistance neces-
sary to its investigations, police assist-
ance is available ; but this isn’t enough,
I can remember when the welkin rang
with shouts for a royal commission to
investigate the operations of a Dental
Board —not the present one, of course.
Are we to go Soviet step by step? —
Yankitout (N.S.W.).
About two-thirds of the members of
the N.S.W. Dental Board are practising
dentists. Under the present Act the
board has extraordinary powers ; never-
theless, it asks for more. A royal com-
mission is practically always headed by a
Judge or a K.C., selected for his aloof-
ness from the matter to be investigated,
as well as his high professional standing.
Such an attitude could scarcely be ex-
pected of a semi-public board ; and I
daresay there are very few dentists with
legally-trained minds. I know of none
on the present board. Solicitors accused
of professional offences are haled before
a tribunal whose impartiality is beyond
question. Why not the same right for
dentists?— Dental Nurse (N.S.W.).
Optometrists and Oculists
In “Victoria’s Eyes” (B. 16/ 5/ ’34) it
is stated that when an optometrist detects
pathological conditions that may be attri-
butable to blood, nerves or some other
disease, he sends the patient to an oculist
or some other specialist.
It takes a graduate in medicine at least
two years of concentrated practical
and theoretical study to become an
eye-doctor worthy of the name, able to
diagnose with any certainty the early
stages of many pathological ocular
lesions. By what process does an opto-
metrist, trained in testing sight for spec-
tacles, become competent to detect early
pathological conditions at the only stage
at which they are worth discovering,
namely, before vision has become
noticeably affected?
By all means give the optometrist
his due (thumbs down to the quack
optician), but it is wrong that the public
should be given the impression that he
is as competent as a doctor to diagnose
disease. Skilful as many optometrists
are at measuring refractive errors, when
it comes to anything but the more
obvious forms of ocular pathology
“Having eyes they see not, neither do
“What’s biting him? It’s lions we’re after!”
they understand.” How can they?—•
M. B. (N.S.W.).
Air Defence
The Bulletin is of the opinion (B.
30/5/’34) that a larger aerial training
force can be built up in Australia. I
agree with it, and, apart from possible
volunteers who have had no flying ex-
perience, I am sure there are many in
the same position as myself—ready to
train if given a chance.
Holder of an “A”-class license, a
Bachelor of Engineering (and therefore
in a position to understand the latest de-
signs in petrol- or oil-engined aircraft),
member of a rifle club, 31 years old and
physically fit, I’m prepared to train if the
Defence Department will send to my
district—and to any city or important
aerodrome—at the same time each year,
for a certain period, one or more
machines, instructors, doctor and ground-
engineers. A definite time each year
would have to be fixed to admit of
businessmen making their arrangements.
My proposal would permit holders of an
“A”-class license to be given, say, four
hours’ dual instruction and then the
necessary three hours’ solo to renew the
license each year. .This could then be
followed by aerobatics, night- and blind-
flying. The training would fit a man to
become a reservist, to be called up in the
event of war.
Many men have allowed their “A”-
class license to expire for several reasons
—financial, distance from aero clubs and
the like. If war came the present train-
ing machines and all other aircraft would
be called up for active scervice ; im-
ported machines would arrive, and there
would be very few trained men avail-
able to handle them.
It seems a pity that men once trained
at their own expense should be pre-
vented by ordinary circumstances from
keeping fit to help their country, especi-
ally as with very little expenditure the
annual manoeuvres of the R.A.F. could
be made to incorporate such training.—
J. H. L. (N.S.W.).
A.B.C. and Performers
Glad to hear that the Broadcasting
Commission has a “fair scale of mini-
mum wages” for radio actors (B.
20/6/’34); still, I know a performer who
got £3 3s. for 12 rehearsals and a per-
formance. Also a lady who was called
upon for three rehearsals and a perform-
ance and was paid one guinea. Speakers
seem to be worse off than anyone else ;
the standard fee is apparently one guinea
in the daytime and £1 11s. 6d. at night.
For these amounts the individual may
have to spend days in research, prepara-
tion and typing or copying. Compare
them with the fees paid to the “barris-
ters” in the “Consider Your Verdict”
series ; they get £2 2s. for reading into a
microphone, for a matter of seven or
eight minutes, a plain piece of English
which they have not had to prepare. The
Commission seems to be asking us to
form a trade union.—Ekim (N.S.W.).
Hospital Lights
I had an accident, and was taken to
a South Aus. country hospital. Every-
thing was of the best except this —the
lights were nothing short of a torture.
Bare, unshaded electric globes blazed in
the middle of the wards and private
rooms, rendering it impossible for one
who had to lie flat on his back to read
after dark. The only way I could get
any relief from the glare was to keep
the eyes shut under the sheet.
I have an old grievance against hos-
pital lighting. Years ago, enteric stretched
me out, and after I was discharged from
hospital I found that my eyes were very
wonky. “Been working a lot under arti-
ficial light lately?” asked the eye-doctor.
“No,” I replied. “I’ve been in hos-
pital” “That’s it,” he snapped. “An
unshaded electric globe blazing right
above your bed night after night, eh?
Well, it’s glasses for you for the rest of
your life.” I’ve since been amazed to
find how many people can date their
having to take to glasses from a spell in
hospital.—H. A. L. (S.A.).
Denial
A recent Bulletin reference to Mr.
John Curtin’s political experiences con-
cluded by stating that “he has found
the great personal popularity of old Wat-
son a heavy handicap in Fremantle.” I
could wish that that statement was true,
because it would be most comforting to
feel that people among whom I have
lived for some 40 years hold me in such
regard, but unfortunately your remarks
are untenable and, in my opinion, a re-
flection on the electors I represent. You
certainly infer that the electors were so
stupid as to elect a man whose views
they did not share merely because they
liked him. Surely a low estimate to
place on those electors’ intelligence.
The fact is that Mr. Curtin and the
National candidate lost the seat because
they stood for a discredited, ineffective
and costly system of political buffoonery
which has landed this country in a piti-
able morass. My success was not due
to personal popularity at all, but was
due to the fact that it gave the electors
the opportunity of registering their dis-
approval of coterie, mechanical politics,
and you may be quite sure that, given
the same opportunity, the people of Aus-
tralia would have registered the same
vote. Surely the recent European and,
indeed, world developments proclaim the
collapse of the whole effete political
structure. — W. Watson (W.A.).
The Censor’s Blue Pencil
The curious anomalies of film censor-
ship were driven home to me when I
fidgeted through an alleged English
comedy in which every line of dialogue
had been written, and every foot of
film taken, around a central theme of a
pornographic play on words and atti-
tudes. There was a great-number of
children and youths in the audience who
must have asked what the “plot” was
all about. A few days later I saw where
more or less harmless pictures had been
cut.
I have been in a position to see cen-
sored portions of films in the cutting-
room. Yards of leg-showings that would
mean nothing to the innocent have been
deleted, whereas permission has been
given for bar-room jokes to be bellowed
from 1000 screens. Five thousand feet
of film has been made around one word
with a double-meaning.
What are we to do with our censor-
ship? Are we to have a censor who sees
a nasty inference in an undraped leg and
yet fails to detect the jokes of harridans
on the lips of blonde screen futilities?
Or are we to have one educated in the
ways of this wicked world who would
know just how much Little Emily should
know? — Eric Bedford (N.S.W.).
No Use For It
I have no use for the accepted design
for the Melbourne centenary medal. On
one side is an electricity pylon, which
most visitors will not recognise until
they have taken a trip beyond Essen-
don; on the other are a ram’s skull
and a grain of wheat. A grain of wheat
seems mean at a time when the unsold
surplus is so big that Herbert Gepp says
the Mallee farmers are on the verge of
Bolshevism; a silo would have been
better. And even admirers must admit
that the skull is inadequate. Most people
would feel more kindly towards a plain
leg of lamb. — Atheling (Vic.).
Back to Byzantium
Is Australia going the way of Rome and
Byzantium, which became mere machines
for supplying a howling mob with holi-
days and sport and free feeds before
more virile and serious-minded peoples
overwhelmed them? Judging by the
atmosphere of the press, it is beginning to
look like it. Modern readers are a little
shocked and amused to read that the
control of Constantinople at one stage in
its history fell into the hands of two
sporting bodies, which devoted themselves
almost entirely to chariot-racing and the
racketeer business. But can we claim
to be so far away from this state when
we find a paper like Melbourne “Argus”
devoting two-thirds of its main articles
on its principal news page to Australia’s
batting against Lancashire, Australia’s
tennis in Paris and a Geelong football
match, the only other items worthy to be
squeezed in at the top of the page being
a list of new peers, the expulsion of a
correspondent from Germany and an
argument between Messrs. Lyons and
Page.
Only a week or two ago a Sunday
newspaper announced that 240 barristers,
solicitors and other highly qualified
persons had applied for a job in Sydney
worth five pounds a week. Yet I have
been trying for five years to find even
one person who is competent to regulate
a grandfather clock and mend properly
an antique chair. Moreover, I have dis-
covered that, though there are hundreds
of persons anxious to work in the garden
for 10s. a day, there is not one in 40 of
them who knows even the rudiments of
the job. They can usually push a lawn-
mower, and that is the end of it.
Most of us are apt to sneer at Russia
with her shock industrial troops and her
passion for making a fetish of work ;
but if we do not look out the Mosko-
vitches will survive, while Australia is
remembered only as a race of effeminate
sport-watchers whose lack of sense of
proportion made the hitting of a little
ball with a piece of wood the absorbing
national mania, while the country starved
for artisans.—E. &O. E. (N.S.W.).

Wool Yarns No. 6.
Through the Mill
Have you, Dear Reader, any idea, when you choose
a suit or dress material, what has gone into its
manufacture? What has happened to it as it passed
through the mill? Why it is good? Why it appeals
to you? If not, let us give you. . . .but a small idea,
certainly. . . .but one that will let you see some
of our problems .... and yours.
TAKE WOOI .AND YARRA FALLS
Take wool. . . .and Yarra Falls, the largest textile
mills in the Southern Hemisphere. Yarra Falls uses
18,000 bales of wool, and turns it into 2,500,0001 b.
of yarn and 1,750,000 yards of woven fabrics
annually. It has mill floor-space of eight acres; plant
and buildings representing a capital investment of
over £800,000; and employs 1250 skilled operatives.
In short', Yarra Falls is in itself a great Australian
Secondary Industry, and, as such, is of interest to you.
As an Australian, wool, of course, interests you. You
will see plenty of it at Yarra Falls. Here, in the
sorting and blending rooms, are great heaps of it.
£5OOO worth passes through the mill every week.
Raw wool is greasy, so first' Yarra Falls scours it,
removing grease and dirt and foreign matter, making
it soft, snowy, fleecy. This the ' Carding Engines”
take in hand. These card the wool, open out and
intermingle the fibres and remove impurities, and
deliver the wool in the form of a long, continuous
sliver. This sliver goes to the Noble combing
machine, which combs from it the shorter fibres,
or noils, and delivers for spinning the longer
fibres, or “tops.”
In the Yarn Departments, these tops are spun into
yarn. Yarn for weaving and yarn for knitting that
is, after being dyed if colours are required; and it is
as well to mention that Yarra Falls produces 1 200 solid
shades and 3500 tonings in its yarns! The weaving
yarns with which we are concerned—are produced
on machinery which gradually draws out the fibres,
reducing the diameter of the ’sliver” and simultane-
ously twisting it slightly. The completed single yarn
is then twisted into 2-, 3- or 4-ply yarn as required,

and finally wound on to large warp beams the
“warp” of your material.
The weaving looms of Yarra Falls are wonders to
behold. Over, under, through, between the threads
of this “warp” the “weft” threads fly, following
uncannily the pattern arranged by the designer, pro-
ducing Twills and Fancy Worsted Suitings. .. ,

Wool Crepes. . . .Wool Georgettes. .. . Then there
are inspections for defects. Dyeing Yarra Falls
offers you, Madam, 600 exquisite shadings in piece-
dyed materials, fast-dyed with British dyes Shrink-
ing all Yarra Falls materials are pre-shrunk Milling,
Cropping, Pressing. . . .
Specify YARRA FALLS Materials
Those are some of our problems, some of the things
we have to look to in transforming the raw wool into
finished materials for Australian men, women and
children to wear. That we have tackled them
successfully is evidenced by the growth of Yarra
Falls in the 16 years since it was established. For
Yarra Falls operatives know their jobs. They have
been “Through the Mill.” And your material prob-
lems? They are easy of colution. When ordering
your next suiting or dress material, just specify
“YARRA FALLS” And your material problems
will be solved.

THE SENTRY IN THE ’TWEEN-DECKS.
BY J. H. M. ABBOTT.
PRIVATE WILLIAM UTTING, of his
Majesty’s New South Wales Corps,
stood at “attention” on the quarter-
deck of the transport Neptune and
listened in amazement to the insulting
description of his person, character and
ancestry offered to whom it might or
might not concern by Mr. John Gilbert,
the red-faced master of that uncomfort-
able vessel.
Over the starboard bulwarks the white
cliffs of Dover reared themselves against
the cloud-flecked blue of a breezy day
as the ship stood over towards the coast
of France, with every sail set and drawing
and the breeze making pleasant music
through the tautened cordage of the
rigging.
The scarlet-jacketed young soldier, fully
equipped for guard duty, stood rigidly
upright, though swaying slightly to the
motion of the ship, whilst Captain Gil-
bert flourished a telescope at the object
of his wrath. Up at the poop-rail, above
his head, one of the officers of the detach-
ment, a pale and bilious-looking young
man, stared down in resentful astonish-
ment at what he saw.
For’ard of the sentry was the stout
barricade stretching athwartships from
bulwark to bulwark, behind which the
female convicts were taking their turn of
the daily dose of fresh air and exercise
prescribed for them under the regulations
of the surgeon-in-charge, Dr. John
Harris.
“Ye herring-gutted lobster,” roared
Captain Gilbert, “I’ll teach ye to make
eyes at them women. Leave the deck.”
“Can’t be done, sir. I’m here till th’
corp’ral relieves me. Anyway, I on’y
gave the woman her ’kerchief what’d
blowed across th’ fence.”
“Ye’d answer back, would ye? Ye
swine!” bellowed the commander, step-
ping forward with the telescope raised
threateningly above his head. The soldier
immediately raised his musket to the
“charge.” Then came a cool remark
from the edge of the poop.
“Pray, restrain yourself, Captain Gil-
bert. The sentry’s quite right. I wit-
nessed the incident myself. In any case,
he may not leave the deck without orders
from his superior officer —which you are
not, sir.”
Captain Gilbert strode wrathfully to
the weather poop-ladder and ascended
it with haste. The officer—he was a
subaltern—turned to confront the angry
master as he gained the higher deck.
“Damme, Mr. Macarthur, I’d have ye
to know that I am the master of this
ship. If I order any man off the deck, he
must go.”
“And I’d have you to know, sir, that
I am officer-of-the-day, and that no
sentry can leave his post without my
orders. I’ll thank you not to interfere
with the soldiers. They are no concern
of yours, sir.”
“Ye’ll hear more o’ this, sir. I’ll
report ye to Captain Nepean.”
“Report and be d d to you!”
replied Lieutenant John Macarthur, turn-
ing on his heel and walking aft.
A few incidents of this run from Lon-
don to Portsmouth were related one even-
ing by Surgeon Harris when dining
with Baron Alt, the Surveyor-General.
The Baron inhabited an eligible mansion
of wattle-and-daub, distinguished from
most of the private houses of Sydney
for the reason that it had two rooms, to
say nothing of a lean-to at the back.
“Ach, my tear Dogdor,” the Baron
remarked as he hospitably ladled
another filling of punch into his friend’s
glass, “we had hoped so mooch for the
arrifal of the Segond Fleed, and have
been greadly disappointed. Such a stade
of signess, such hardships, such mor-
dality! Mistress Magarthur has told me
about the voyage which they began in
the Nebdune and finished in the Sgar-
borough.”
The surgeon, a healthy-looking young
Irishman of thirty-six, waved his church-
warden at the Baron and nodded
vigorously.
“The Neptune! Good Gad, my dear
Baron, an accursed ship! I was in her
myself at the beginning of the voyage,
but, thank God, I managed to get out
of her —though the ship I came on in,
the Surprize, was no East Indiaman
for comfort. Have you heard of all
the trouble Mr. Macarthur had with the
fellow who was to have brought her out
—of his duel with Captain Gilbert at
Plymouth?”
The Baron shook his head.
“No, I haf nodings heard. I peg of
you to blease dell me of Mr. Magarthur
and this man Gilbert.”
So Dr. Harris related some of his
experiences of the beginning of the
Second Fleet’s dreadful voyage.
“When first I came aboard at Graves-
end, Baron, I found that Captain Gilbert
and Mr. Macarthur were already at
loggerheads. On the passage round to
Plymouth they scarce exchanged a word
—except angry ones —and one morning,
in the Great Cabin, very nearly came to
blows. I saw the whole affair.
“Captain Nepean, who was in com-
mand of the troops, was writing in the
Great Cabin, when Mr. Macarthur com-
plained to him that existence was almost
impossible in his sleeping cabin owing to
the stench from the convicts’ quarters.
Surely to heaven, he observed with heat,
Captain Gilbert could make some dif-
ferent arrangement! Just at that moment
who should come in but the master of
the ship.
“ ‘Damme,’ he says, ‘what the devil’s
this tin-soldier grouching about now, Mr.
Nepean? I’ll write to the War Office
and have him turned out of the ship.’
“Naturally, Macarthur, who’s not got
the sweetest of tempers at any time, flared
up, and told the ruffian he was an inso-
lent fellow and should mind his busi-
ness. Upon which Gilbert put his hand
to Mr. Macarthur’s breast and gave him
a push. ‘Get out of the way!’ says
he.
“They nigh came to blows at this,
but Captain Nepean interfered and
begged Macarthur not to proceed to any
extremities, as the ship was under way.
He had no doubt Captain Gilbert, after
cooler reflection, would apologise.
“We didn’t get to Plymouth for a week,
owing to faulty navigation, for we didn’t
know where we were until we saw the
Land’s End. Then we put about, and
in three days got into the Sound.
“As the ship was about to anchor I
observed Macarthur come out of the
cabin on to the quarter-deck and look
about, as if in search of someone.
Presently he espies Captain Gilbert
a-standing behind the rail at the break o’
the poop, roaring and bellowing orders.
Immediately, with a very white face and
lips compressed, Macarthur runs up the
poop ladder and makes his way towards
the skipper.
“That gentleman, who, if not refined
in character, knows how to be refined
in methods of insult, turns his back upon
the Lieutenant as he observes him
approach, and walks down the other
ladder to the quarter-deck.
“I saw Macarthur mutter something
and smite the rail with his hand in a
spasm of rage. Then he hastened down
the ladder and confronted Captain
Gilbert on the quarter-deck, where
Captain Nepean and several others were
standing.
“ ‘Sir,’ roars Macarthur, ‘you’re a
d ——d scoundrel!’
“Gilbert gets very red in the face and
makes a step toward the other, as though
to strike him.
“ ‘Go below, sir! ’ he roars.
“ ‘Not till I’ve had my say,’ retorts
Macarthur. ‘You’ve behaved like a
blackguard, Mr. Gilbert, to my wife and
myself,’ he sings out. ‘You’ve no breeding
—no manners. I hold you in contempt!’
“ ‘Be d d to you, you whipper-
snapper!’ bellows Gilbert, purple with
passion. ‘I don’t give a tinker’s curse for
your airs. I’m to be seen ashore, sir—
wherever you choose.’
“ ‘Good! ’ cries Macarthur. ‘The
Fountain Tavern —by the Docks—at four
o’clock,’ he says as he turns on his heel
and goes into the cabin very wrathfully.”
“Ach, himmel!” grunted the Baron.
“And a duello dere was? Did you see
this engounder, Dogdor?”'
“Faith, then, I didn’t. I’d no desire
to get mixed up in the affair, for I’d a
very well-grounded suspicion ’twouldn’t
be long before I had trouble of my own
with this blackguard captain.”
“And the duello —was anybody in-
jured?”
“Devil a one of them. A shot each,
and it was over. Reconciliations. Mutual
apologies—and so on. But ’twas no time
at all at all before there was more
trouble. And myself consarned this
time—or partially consarned.”
“I am all addention, Dogdor.”

“Well, a few nights after, not having
been very well all day, I'd gone to bed
early, when Mr. Macarlhur comes to my
cabin and requests me for to take
charge, as he was going ashore to fetch
off Captain Nepean, the master of the
ship having declared his intention of
sailing immediately. So off he went, and
L rolled up in my blankets, a-praying for
a quiet night.
“But about half-past nine 1 was.
awakened by the sergeant of the guard,
who begged I’d turn out to endeavor to
quell a riot amongst the women. I got
out of bed, put on some clothes and
went to the women’s quarters, where I
found the two sergeants holding a girl,
who swore vehemently she’d be the death
of two or three women at the end of
the room. I desired the sergeants to
let her go, as 1 thought she would not
dare to put her threats into execution ;
but, by Gad, she flew at them like a
tigress. We held her again, and I told
the sergeant to bring me a pair of hand-
cuffs, which he did, with the armorer
to put them on.
“Captain Gilbert, who’d only been
waiting for this, bellowed down the
hatchway several coarse and vulgar
observations —I’ll spare your ears, me
good Baron. ‘Who’s that making such
a racket in the ’tween-decks?’
“ ‘ ’Tis me,’ I replies.
“ ‘And who the devil are you, d n
ye?’ he shouts.
“ ‘Dr. Harris,’ I tells him.
“ ‘Well, who the hell gave Dr. Harris
authority to take command in my ship?’
“I told him I assumed no command,
either in the ship or the corps—that
I was now obeying my officer’s direc-
tions, and let me see who would hinder
me.
“He let out a howl of rage and
jumped down the ladder. He took hold
of me by the chest and d d me and
Captain Nepean several times. Then he
ran into the women’s room, and called
out to them they were used in a most
cruel and barbarous manner. I told
him he ought to be ashamed of himself
for his misbehavior ; and he went for the
sentry, grabbing him by the throat and
damning him.
“ ‘Don’t shove,’ said the sentry, a
young fellow named Utting, ‘or I’ll run
you through.’ But Gilbert would not
leave the man alone. He opened his
breast, damned the sentry again and said,
‘Why don’t you run me through?’
“I interfered, and told him he ought to
know better. Finally I got him to leave
the ’tween-decks.
“I thought everything restored to peace,
and went to put on the remainder of my
clothes, but was again alarmed with his
swearing at the sentry. He had brought
down the lieutenants to be witnesses to
the sentry’s threats, which, of course,
were very proper to the man’s duty. I
appealed to them, as King’s officers, to
know whether a sentry placed by an
officer of marines would ever suffer them
to drive him about as that poor fellow
was by the master of a merchantman.
“They felt the conviction of my words,
turned about, and went on deck. I went
up with them, where I sustained much
scurrility and abuse from Captain Gil-
bert, which I did not think proper to
reply to at that time. Lord, he was a
beauty!”
“Ach, der schweinhund! And was he
punished for his ill-conduct, Dogdor?”
“Well, he was finally got rid of by
Captain Nepean’s appealing to his
brother the Under-Secretary, who hap-
pened to be at Bath, and to whom he
sent me by post-chaise to make an
appeal. A Captain Trail was sent down
to take over the ship. But he was little
better than Gilbert. The Macarthurs
were driven by him out of the ship, and
continued the voyage in the Scarborough.
I was able, I’m glad to say, to exchange
into the Surprize. In the Neptune, dur-
ing the voyage to Port Jackson, under
Captain Trail’s gentle treatment 183 men
and 12 women died!”
“Ach, Gotti And how was it with
your own ship, the Surprize?”
“Oh, we lost only eighty-five.”
* * * *
At daylight on January 3 in the year
1800, the barque Advocate, Captain John
Gilbert master, dropped down on the
tide from Sydney Cove to the southern
end of the Sow and Pigs reef, just within
the Heads of Port Jackson, where she
brought to at anchor. Presently she
hoisted the signal indicating “Escaping
prisoners discovered aboard,” which was
repeated from the signal station at the
.South Head to the one on the eminence
above Sydney Cove where, a couple of
years later. Governor King began to
build the still-unfinished citadel of
Sydney which was named Port Phillip.
The naval officer’s boat went down the
harbor, and in due course returned to
town carrying in the sternsheets the run-
away convicts and the master of the
Advocate, whose presence had been de-
manded by the Governor. Three days
later, the Advocate departed for Bengal,
her commander having given bills on his
owners in London for a considerable
sum of money in forfeiture of the bonds
into which every merchant captain was
obliged to enter against the possibility
of his vessel being used by prisoners as
a means of escape from the penal settle-
ment.
On the evening of the day on which
the Advocate had been detained, Ser-
geant William Utting, of the N.S.W.
Corps, took rum and tobacco with Mr.
Timothy Dignum, the gaoler of the
prison in George-street. They had met
by appointment at the licensed house
conducted by Mr. lobias Linklatei
opposite the gaol wall, known as The
Black Hen. And this is the deposition
of Sergeant Utting as to the day’s doings,
in so far as they concerned Captain
Gilbert’s ship.
“Toby,” he said impressively to the
gaoler, “ye’re a true genius—nothing less.
Them three fellies you picked out done
the job beautiful. We fitted ’em out wi’
red jackets, an’ took ’em aboard wi th
search-party that boarded the Advocate
in the Cove afore she dropped down to
th’ Heads. On the way down th’ bay
they slips below an’ throws th’ jackets
out of a port into the boat. When we
come down there, o’ course I finds ’em
an’ takes ’em along to Johnny Gilbert.
“ ‘ ’Ere,’ J says, ‘Cao’n, they says
you hid ’em aboard y’self, bein’ short-
’anded. Wot abart it?’
“Curse! You never ’eard no one
curse like ’im. Knows nothing abart
’em, o’ course. But that yarn won’t
wash, I tells ’im—’e’ll ’ave to signal for
th’ Naval Hofficer. Well, ’e raved an’ ’e
swore ; but ’twasn’t any use, an’ by-n -
bye he’s brought up afore Cap’n Hunter.
Th’ Gov’nor’s pretty short wi’ him —tells
him he’ll have to forfeit his bond of
£5OO, an’ tells th’ secketary to make out
the bills. Cap’n Gilbert signs ’em, an’
goes down to th’ boat. On th’ way down
I reminds him of old times aboard th’
transport Neptune ten year ago, an’ con-
grattylates ’im on th’ fine ship ’e’s got
now. ’E gimme a look.
“ ‘Wot’s the game?’ says ’e. ‘Wot
d’ye know about th’ Neptune?’
“ ‘Hinside an’ hout,’ I says. ‘Many’s
th’ time I been sentry on th’ ’tween-
decks,’ I says—‘outside th’ women’s
quarters.’
“ ‘Ye dog! ’ he says, reckernisin’ me.
That’s all ’e says. ‘Ye dog!’ But ye
should ha’ ’eard th’ way ’e said it. It
done me good.”
“Them lags, though?” queried Toby
Linklater. “Won’t they cop a lashin’?”
“In coorse they will,” laughed Gaoler
Dignum. “But 1 knowed enough for to
’ave ’em ’ung. A sore back’s better’n a
stretched neck hany day o’ th’ week.”
Long Reef.
The lines of the ocean surges
Pass here with the pomp of kings—
Blue crest that the south wind urges,
White wave that the north wind brings;
And ever the reef-line turns them
To towering ranks, ablaze
With wrath for the power that spurns them,
Who have come by the storm-king's ways.
Oh! red are the bold cliffs, glistening
In the spume that is battle-smoke,
Red cliffs that have waited, listening,
Since the first strong battle-stroke,
To the blows of the vanguard hurling
Its weight on the sullen foe,
To the cries of the lost waves swirling
In caverns cold below.
The ships,* in their bravery passing,
Steer wide where the reef runs clear,
Where the baffled breakers, massing,
Charge in with a throaty cheer.
Ah! green are the fields, and quiet,
Inshore from the iron heights,
But the people hear the riot
Of the struggle on stormy nights.
Since ever the ocean’s waters
Came under the sea-gods’ care
And the spurs of the sea-gods’ daughters,
The Long Reef has been there;
Since ever the dawns came slowly,
Like maidens shy, to wed
The Day, in a passion holy,
The high cliffs have been red
With blood from white flanks at the onset,
When the sea-gods’ daughters ride
Wild waves to the charge in the sunset,
And the Long Reef moans where they died—
Where the steeds that are ocean surges
Met death with the pride of slaves,
And the moon in her beauty merges
Her light with the mist of their graves

“BLUE NORTH”
H. DRAKE-BROCKMAN
This strongly-written first-novel holds
the color and romantic appeal of
fortune-seeking on the West Aus-
tralian pearling grounds in the days
when that glamorous life made its
irresistible appeal to the adventurous
of all kinds and classes. “Hand-
some John Fordyce, throwing off
the petty ties binding him to his
society-obsessed lady and the social
life of the South, adventures into the
blue North in search of complete
freedom among men. He finds it
there, but only through the agency
of Woman—a wanton his handsome
figure attracts at one of the pearling
outposts, and who, when he breaks
from their one-night liaison, takes a
fiercely-jealous revenge on a pretty
little waif of the outpost, with unex-
pected results for herself, for the
waif, and for the man she sought to
hurt. A feature of the novel is the
realistic presentation of the pearling
life, spiced with adventure, rich
finds and sometimes violent action.
A very colorful picture of pearling
up and down the blue waters of the
Nor’-West.

BY “HAMER.”
BRADLEY dropped from the end of
his rope of blankets and as his
feet touched the ground shot him-
self outward. In a split second he was
lying under the cover of some tall cab-
bages in the gaol garden.
He lay there for a moment, with heart
seeming to choke him by its quick beat-
ing. It seemed incredible that he should
have come so far without being de-
tected, yet there was no sound of an
alarm. On the wall above the warder
nonchalantly came to the end of his
beat, and stood outlined against the
starry sky.
Directly he turned, Bradley, lifting
himself no higher than was absolutely
necessary for movement, made a short
dash and dropped again when instinct
told him that the warder had reached
the end of his beat and would be re-
turning. It took merely a few such
dashes to bring him to the lower wall
surrounding the prison vegetable garden.
He was very cautious now, waiting the
exact moment when the warder’s back
was turned as he looked inward upon
the gaol yards. It came ; and, dropping
over into the lower ground where he
could move screened from observation,
Bradley was free.
“As free as a rabbit with all the dogs
in the neighborhood on his tail!” he
soliloquised bitterly.
Strangely, the hopelessness of escape
did not present itself to him until he
was outside the walls. In all the delect-
able dreams which had led him to this
desperate venture, his thought had gone
no further than the freedom that could
be his once the cage was broken. Now
he saw the hazards, the almost futility,
of that freedom. He would be recap-
tured—that was fairly certain—and a
penalty for his escape would be added
to the few months he still had to serve.
He wished he had stayed in his cell.
Still, there was some satisfaction in
feeling free, if only for a little time.
Now he had his liberty he would make
it last as long as possible.
Clothes were the first consideration.
If he was still wearing prison garb when
morning came there would be no hope
for him. He moved away quickly, plac-
ing distance between himself and the
cage from which he had broken.
The world seemed full of dogs. Bradley
hated dogs now more than he had ever
hated them in his life. He was chased
out of three premises by animals
which only revealed their presence when
he seemed safely within the fence. A
big fellow, one of those accursed Alsa-
tians, he thought,, had kept a strip of
trouser-leg which would be a dead put-
away if it was found and linked up with
the name of an escaped convict.
The glad thought that, after all, fate
was helping him came when a half-
opened gate led him to a door that had
been left open; a cautious entrance
showed him the interior of a house
laundry, with linen set out to be aired.
In the midst of it, on a coathanger, was
a suit of clothes.
The dim light was sufficient to let him
see also a safety-razor and some old
toilet accessories piled on the window-
ledge beyond the washtubs.
The sound of footsteps approaching
along the path by which he had come
made him seek cover in a corner behind
some hanging bed-sheets. The new-
comer paused only long enough to turn
the key in the door he had shut behind
him, and walked through, oblivious of
the intruder.
Bradley wasted no time. He took
what he wanted and fled.
In a creek in the park he shaved with
an old razor and a mirror that was part
of the loot.
“I look like a parson!” he exclaimed.
“The Reverend Stonker Bradley! ” There
was something amusing about it, but it
wouldn’t be amusing if he were caught.
The escape from prison and the theft of
a parson’s rig-out would be linked, he
imagined, very quickly. His one hope
was to get as far away as possible with-
out allowing himself to be spotted.
He walked straight and hard when he
found a good road, thankful that there
were not many passing vehicles to drive
him to cover. He dared not seek a lift
from people who would be bound to
talk. When he reckoned that he had put
ten miles between himself and the scene
of his escape he felt more comfortable.
It was probably because he was
heavy with sleep, and less alert, that the
motor-car caught up to him before he
could slip aside from the road. The
driver pulled up. “Out early, padre."
he remarked genially.
Bradley felt he had to play the part
for which his clothes had cast him. He
did not know much about it; his meet-
ings with parsons had been rare, and
his knowledge of their habits had been
derived from the vaudeville stage, but
he would chance it.
“The business of the Lo-ord calls at
all hours,” he droned.
“That wasn’t your car, live or six
miles back, was it, padre? The single-
seater at the side of the road?”
Heaven seemed to have provided a
first-class explanation for the fugitive’s
presence on the road. “It was, deah
brothah,” he explained hastily.
“Had a breakdown?” asked the
driver sympathetically. “Perhaps we
could fix it for you. It wouldn’t take
us quarter of an hour to drive back
with you. If not, we could give you a
tow to the garage at Bungerville. Going
there, I suppose?”
“No, no, deah brothah.” The idea of
going back had caused him some agita-
tion. “The car is—ah —hopeless, I fear
—feah. I can arrange to have it—ah—
attended to. My—ah—mission is be-
yond Bungerville.”
“By jove, you must be the padre who
was coming out to my sister’s place for
the marryin’. My name’s Dowling,
brother of Mrs. Burton, of Craiglea.
Jump in, padre! Lucky we happened
along. It’s a hell of a —pardon, padre!
it’s a pretty long step to Bungerville.”
It was because Bradley was dog-tired
that he fell into what he soon realised
was a trap out of which escape would be
difficult. The men in the back seat
genially made room and friendly hands
dragged him in as though making up his
mind for him. Yet their few remarks
were full of respect for the cloth he was
wearing.
Bradley was so weary that the motion
of the car and the cramped comfort of
his cushioned seat soon lulled him to a
doze. He woke up spasmodically, how-
ever, and during a wakeful interlude, his
eyes still closed, heard the driver mur-
muring to the man beside him:
“They expected him to arrive by train,
I think. My sister May, you know, has
a deny on the local parson because he
drinks a glass when he wants it. She
told me she was going to invite this
padre. Met him in Sydney. From what
she says he’s t.t. and the right man for
the splicing.”
“Doesn’t seem a bad chap, for a
parson.”
“Hates licker like poison.”
Bradley stirred. The scream of the
brakes and some shouting shook him up
in time to see the narrow averting of a
smash with a heavily-laden truck which
had veered out ahead of them. “Close
call, that! ” exclaimed the two men beside
him in one breath.
“Damn close!” agreed Bradley.
They looked at him curiously. Bradley,
remembering his part, added hastily, “The
Lo-ord was with us, deah brothah!”
Strangely enough, it seemed that there
evolved an added respect for the parson
who could swear.
When they arrived in Bungerville and
pulled up at a refreshment shop, the
driver suggested tea. They would have
breakfast when they got to Craiglea, he
said.
Bradley was thinking hard. He was in
a mess. When he got to Craiglea the
parson he was supposed to be would
turn up, and there would be an exposure.
He cogitated on ways of escape, includ-
ing making a bolt for it from these
friends. Finally he decided to allow
matters to go on and await a more for-
tunate opportunity.
Only Johnson was drinking tea with
him. He had hardly wakened to this fact
before Rogers came in. When the latter
sat down Johnson got up with a brief
“Excuse me a moment.” Watching him
surreptitiously Bradley saw him make
direct for the hotel.
That was the reason for all the signs
and looks he had noticed. It was tea,
out of deference to the parson ; but the
others were quietly getting all the beer
they felt they needed. Blast ’em!
Bradley’s suggestion that he should
try to hire a car for himself was scouted
by the hospitable Dowling. You couldn't
get a car in, Bungerville, he explained.
The stranded car? Dowling said he
had arranged with the local garage for it
to be towed in and attended to.

It looked as though someone was
going to be astonished later on.
Several times Bradley contemplated a
leap from the car, but it was travelling
too fast.
Crajglea, a roomy homestead at which
the whole neighborhood seemed to be
gathering, did not at once present the
troubles he anticipated.
“Dear Mr. Sampson, it is so good of
you to come all this way,” said the tall,
austere woman who came to greet him,
looking at him keenly through her
glasses in a way that showed that she
was, providentially, short-sighted. “It
must have been tiring. I would hardly
have known you!”
“Travel —ah —makes some —ah—change
in the appearance, deah sistah!”
“Oh, yes ; and you must be weary and
hungry. We thought you would come
by train. I’ve only just sent a car to
the station for you. You got my
cheque?” she added in an undertone.
“Ye-es. Thanks, deah sistah.” Hope
sprang in Bradley’s breast. The only
person who might be expected to know
he was an impostor was short-sighted.
The real parson would not arrive for a
time, at least.
The open door of a big lough boy in
the room into which he was shown for
a spruce-up showed an array of suits,
one of which would not immediately
be missed. A quick change and a hur-
ried departure were in his mind. His
disappearance would create astonish-
ment, but....
His hand upon a suit was suddenly
withdrawn as the door opened.
“Going to have a brush-up myself,”
said Dowling genially. “Breakfast is
waiting for you, padre.”
Bradley found himself gripped as by
a nightmare. There was always the idea
of seizing an opportunity to steal away,
but whenever he made an effort to lose
himself Mrs. Burton called him to intro-
duce him to some fresh arrival. She
was showing him off. A desperate idea
of abandoning the suit notion, jumping
into one of the cars parked before the
homestead and driving off, ignoring the
astonishment of the assembly, was
checked in a similar manner as he
stepped down from the verandah.
“It is very near the time for the cere-
mony, dear Mr. Sampson,” said Mrs.
Burton. “It is to take place in the draw-
ing-room. Would you like to see the
arrangements?”
Bradley went cold. He had dreaded
the arrival of the real parson ; but if the
real parson did not arrive or was very
late, he, Bradley, would be expected to
perform the ceremony. The bride was a
nice girl, and the ’groom seemed a decent
young chap. It would be criminal.
Then an idea came to him.
“It is—ah —careless of me, deah
sistah,” he said. “I left my—-ah—prayer-
book in the car. Is there some township
where”
“Oh, don’t worry about that, Mr.
Sampson,” returned Mrs. Burton cheer-
fully. “I’ll find a prayer-book. We are
religious people,” she added proudly.
Desperately Bradley sought to make
use of the opportunity of her departure.
He was in the room with the lough boy,
and, with a suit hurriedly gathered, he
hastened to the window, only to find that
the wedding party grouped outside made
escape that way impossible. It was then,
as he stared bewildered out of the win-
dow, that he saw the real holy man
arrive.
In the confusion, Bradley made for
the door. He might get out. ...
He was held spellbound. “Here are
the books, dear Mr. Sampson,” he heard
Mrs. Burton say.
“But I have my own books, Mrs.
Burton,” the rev. gentleman returned in
astonishment. “I am ready at once ; but
first may I have ten minutes alone? I
like to prepare myself with silent prayer
for an occasion like this.”
“Why, certainly. In that room, Mr.
Sampson. I’ll see you are not disturbed.”
Bradley hid himself behind the door.
It closed a minute later, and Bradley
found himself facing an astonished
minister of the gospel who saw before
him something like a comic edition of
himself.
“What’s this?” exclaimed the clergy-
man sharply.
The thoughts that flooded Bradley’s
mind drowned coherency. He found
himself telling the parson everything,
pleading with him for a chance.
He scarcely believed his ears when he
grasped what the minister was saying:
“The conventionally right thing to do
would be to hand you over to the police.
I’m not going to do that. I’m going to
let you escape.”
“You mean it?” Bradley gasped.
“Listen,” the clergyman went on.
“In that suit of clothes you have in your
hands you can get away unnoticed. Start
to change now and be quick. And here’s
a pound.”
“No, mister.”
“Take it, and go straight. I can’t be a
party to stealing, but borrowing doesn’t
matter; so promise me to return the
clothes you are taking. Return them as
soon as you can. You can send them
back anonymously.”
There was a kindness in the parson's
voice that made Bradley’s feel as though
it was melting. He was not used to kind-
ness.
“I’ll do that, mister,” he said eagerly.
“You’re a sport.”
“Too much of a sport, I am afraid,”
the clergyman said. “But I’ll have to
answer for it. When I have left the
room slip out and get away ; and God
go with you!”
Bradley was a sport, too, in his way,
and he experienced a thrill of righteous-
ness a few days later as he posted back
the pawn-ticket for the ten-guinea suit
he had borrowed from the loughboy.
Shakspeare Harry’s Runner.
BY CON DREW.
I WAS mixed up with footrunnin’
onct. It was years ago, when the
Botany Handicaps was boomin’.
Boomin’, you ask me? Why, the
first prize was close on a thousand, and
the winner generally got another thou,
from his backers and a rake-off from
whoever drew him in Adams’s sweep.
Nearly everyone had a runner or two
in them days. They used to keep ’em
smoked away in trainin’-camps at
Botany and Richmond, and give ’em
secret trials.
It was Shakspeare Harry who intro-
duced me to the game. He pulled me up
one mornin’ when I was doin’ a stroll
on the sunny side of Pitt-street.
“What would you think of an un-
seasoned bloke who could run a hundred
yards in even time?” he says.
“I’d think he was a liar if he told me
he could do it,” I says ; for in them days,
when runners stood almost upright on
the mark, the ped who could slide over
a hundred in ten seconds was reckoned
a wonder.
“This bloke ain’t a liar,” says Shak-
speare. “I seen him do it yesterday
He’s in my camp out at Botany now.”
“It ain’t Ted Lazarus or any of then:
blokes, is it?” I asks.
“It ain’t,” says Shakspeare.
“He must be pretty good whoever he
is,” says I; and I goes to move away.
There was a pug I’d promised to meet.
“Don’t be in such a hurry,” says Shaks-
peare. “You’re in on this.”
“In on what?” I says.
“You’re halves with me in this ped
I’ve got. We’ll get a hatful of money
with him.”
“I ain’t in nothin’. Peds ain’t in my
line. If it was a fighter now”
“Fighter!” snorts Shakspeare. “You’ve
got fighters on .the brain, and there ain’t
room for anythink else. Now, listen.
This chap I’ve got comes from W.A., and
no one knows anythink about his runnin’
abilities. He ain’t even well known in
the West, because he’s never appeared in
a perfessional go over there. Now, what
I have in mind is to get him well and
match him with one of them medium
runners.”
“Why not keep him for the Botany
Handicap?”
“Because entries has closed, and I’ve
only had this ped of mine a few days.
No, we’ll have to match him with some-
one.”
‘‘You’ll have to match him, you mean.”
“Both of us will match him. We’ve
been lucky together with fighters, and
we’ll be lucky together in the footrunnin’
business. I’ll take you out to Botany
now.”
When Shakspeare was set on a thing
he took a deal of shiftin’. I agreed to
come into the scheme, and he took me
out to his camp and gave me a knock-
down to his ped. The name was Charlie
Regan.

Next day we gave him a trial. There
was no doubt about him being a bang-
up runner. He slipped over the hundred
in a yard worse than evens.
“He did it in ten to a tick yesterday,”
says Shakspeare. “He’s a bit stiff to-
day.”
‘He’s all right,” I says. ‘‘l’m satis-
fied.”
Well, we got Regan into pretty good
trim, and then we matched him for £5O
a side with a nigger who was trainin’ in
a camp about a mile away from ours.
I only seen him onct before the race.
He came over to our camp with his man-
ager to get the measurin’-tape that
Shakspeare had borrowed from the heads
at Botany runnin’ grounds and had
forgot to return. He was a fine stamp
of a man, and looked every inch a
runner.
When they had gone I says to Shak-
speare, “This bloke looks likely.”
“He’s only jist a runner,” answers
Shakspeare. “I’ve seen him in action
often. That tale his manager put up
about wanting the measurin’-tape to
check the Botany track was all me eye.
You can bet long odds that they’re goin’
to measure off a private run of their
own.”
i Shakspeare’s words come true. Inside
of a week word dribbled in that the nig.
was trainin’ on a private track and was
doin’ wonderful time. There was always
a lot of wild rumors floatin’ round about
the marvellous track work the different
runners were doin’, and I didn’t take
much notice. But when Regan arrived
with the news one day that the black
had ripped over the hundred in a yard
worse than evens, the same , as him, I
didn’t feel too gay.
“He must be pretty good,” I says.
“He’s only jist a runner, I tell you,” .
Shakspeare. come back. “Don’t you
bother, youf head about nothin’. Leave
the worryin’ to me.”
We had further proof that the nigger
was breakin’ the watch about three days
later, when a bookie strolled into the
camp and squats himself down on our
only chair.
“I was passin’ this way,” he says, “and
I thought I’d drop in and see how you
was gettin’ on.”
“Make yourself at home,” says Shak-.
speare.
The bookie pulls out one of them joss-
sticks he called cigars and lights it.
“They tell me,” he says, “your bloke
Regan is doin’ remarkable trials. If I
wasn’t makin’ a book on the match I’d
back him meself. As it is, I’ve got to
lay him to equalise me book.”
“What price will you lay him?” asks
Shakspeare, winkin’ at me.
“Evens,” came back the bookie.
“Don’t stint yourself!” says Shak-
speare.
“You bet an even fifty on the side,
didn’t you?” says the bookie.
“That was before I heard about the
track work the nigger’s doin’,” Shak-
speare says. “I’ll take your 7 to 4.”
“You will not," says the Tommy. “I
ain’t a Santa Claus.” And with that he
floats away.
He came back again, though, two days
later, and, after a lot of arguin’, Shak-
speare takes his £6O to £4O.
He hadn’t been gone more than half
an hour when our scout dashed in with
the news that the nigger had done a
hundred in ten seconds dead.
“Strike a light,” I says. “No wonder
the Tommy was anxious to bet!”
Shakspeare turned to the scout. “Sure
you made no bloomer?”
“Certain,” says the scout. “I checked
me watch this mornin’.’’
“All right,” says Shakspeare, and then
he turns to me.
“You can be out of that bet if you
want to,” says he.
“I’m in,” I says, “and I’m stoppin’ in.”
“Good!” says Shakspeare. “The nig-
ger ain’t won yet.”
Well, the day of the match came
round, and we took Regan down to
Botany. The nigger was already there,
and a crowd of .sports and bookies had
rolled up to see the match. The nigger
was a red-hot favorite. His price was
7 to 4 on ; Regan’s was 6 to 4 against.
We could have got set to £5OO at that
price if rwe’d wanted it.
Just before they lined up a bookie
friend of Shakspeare’s breasts up to him
and says, “1 wouldn’t put no more
money on Regan if I was you.”
“Why?” asks Shakspeare.
“Because you’ve got no chahnce,” the
bookie says. “Yesterday the coon done
the. hundred in nine an’ four-fifths. I’m
fellin’ you this because you did me a
good turn onct, and I wouldn’t like to
see you do your money cold. I clocked
him.”
“What price is our bloke now?” says
Shakspeare.
“Two to one,” came back the Tommy,
Shakspeare pulls a roll of frogskins
out of his pocket. “Put them on Regan,”
he says ; “and if you take my tip you’ll
back him for a motzer yourself.”
With that he turns away and the men
got on their marks.
“This is where I get separated from
a lot of coin,” I says to myself as I
watched the starter. Then a thought
struck me, and I leant over to Shak-
speare.
“You haven’t squared that nigger, by
any chance, have you?” I says.
“I ain’t squared no one,” says Shak-
speare. “Anyway, it’s too late to talk
about squarin’ people now. They’re
away! ”
I never seen a better start. Almost
with the flash of the gun they left the
mark together, and for the first twelve
yards there couldn’t have been an inch
between them. Then the nigger forged
ahead. He was a yard in front of Regan
when they had travelled thirty yards, and
at fifty he had increased his lead
to three.
Regan would have to give him three
yards in fifty! Me heart slid back a
beat.
“We’re gone!” I says.
“Are we?” says Shakspeare. “Just you
wait a second.”
Almost as he spoke Regan cracked on
the pace. He flew like an arrer from a
bow. At eighty yards he was a yard
behind the nig. and gainin’ at every
stride. At ninety he drew level. For a
tick they measured, strides together. Then
Regan slid to the front and beat the nig.
by half a yard.
Talk about a boilover! The black’s
crowd thought he’d been bought, and
threatened to string him up. They would
have manhandled him if blqkes in the
crowd hadn’t took his part. A gang of
Sh if ties who had been bettin’ among
themselves got into holts with one an-
other, and the place was like Donny-
brook.
While the argument was at its height
the bookie who had invested Shakspeare’s
money came back and give him a hand-
ful of. notes. We collected Regan and
beat it for the camp.
After tea that night I Says to Shak-
speare, “You was always pretty certain
that Regan would beat that nigger, eh?”
“I was,” said Shakspeare.
“In spite of the wonderful times he was
doin’?”
“No,” he says, “because of the won-
derful times he wasn’t doin’.”
“As how?” says I.
“Easy enough,” says Shakspeare. “Be-
fore I gave his manager the measurin-
tape I cut a yard or two out of the
middle and fixed it together again. That’s
what beat the nigger.”
Monochrome.
Grey hangs the sky; the earth is grey;
The cocks call faint and far-away,
Like windy clarions in a dream.
Along the path pale puddles gleam,
And bent old men go trudging by,
Beneath the waste of empty sky.
Grey waggons piled with brushwood pass,
Their wheels like velvet on the grass;
Beside the gutter's silver brink
The rain-wet fences, black as ink,
Drip down upon the lilac loam.
Where laggard ducks go waddling home.
The quinces and ' the fig-trees bare
Float palely in the ashen air;
Dead, sodden leaves are on the ground:
Dead leaves, dead leaves are all around!
My feet push through; they make a sound
Of waters splashing; 1 am drowned
In these dead leaves! Their wine-rich
breath
Flangs heavy on my heart like death.
1 move; the sky moves with me, too;
The greyness pierces-through and through.
No light is there. O dull despair!
1 am dissolved upon the air;
Of this grey day a very part,
The dead leaves cold upon my heart.

1 have won to the shrine of shadows, and 1
am alone, alone!
1 have gazed at the god’s forbidden face and
the . bugles of doom have blown
From the dusk of the dreadful garden, where
the blood-swol’n upas thrills,
To the drums of the dead men beating under
the fairy hills.
1 stand at the blind road’s ending, but I am
no more alone,
And the moon is a mist-like lady out of a lyric
blown.
Ah! heart of my heart, bend closer, heart
of my heart that thrills,
Calling love’s merry laughter down from the
morning hills.
QUEENSLAND.

THE BERNARD
CRONIN STORY-
WRITING COURSE
10 LESSONS.
Mr. Cronin’s course is a masterpiece of
expert practicality. The components of
a story-—theme, plot, openings, dialogue,
characterisation and description the
very names of which excite the imagina-
tion, and the awe, of literary aspirants,
are considered in detail with a wealth of
illustration and practical advice that at
once removes many of the more serious
obstacles from the path of the beginner.
The instruction is given in ten lessons
and three supplements. Mr. Cronin’s
own enthusiasm is so great, his sympathy
so large and his handling of the practice
work sent in so competently confident
that the interest of his pupils never flags.
Those Who have a real flair for writing
very soon make a good job of every
piece of work they send in. They are
helped the more inasmuch as they are
never kept waiting for their revised work.
It is true that pupils have to work.
Mr. Cronin is not content with less than
the best they can: do ; and neither are
they allowed to rest content until he has,
by instruction and illustrative revision
of parts’ trained them to polish and re-
polish until the whole is a finished piece
of work truly, expressive of the writer’s
intention and individuality.
Later, in the advanced lessons, the
pupil is sometimes asked to return to an
earlier story, and in the light of his—
and frequently her—added experience
and increased knowledge improve it to
publication standard, Mr. Cronin is
most insistent, however, on his pupils
submitting to editors none but good
work. Not, of course, the best they ulti-
mately will do, but work of such a stan-
dard as will preclude the possibility of
their being classed by editors as per-
manent mediocrities.
The results are becoming increasingly
apparent. Some are given in detail in
“Friendships,” copies of which can be
had on request.
In addition to teaching story-writing,
Mr. Cronin criticises the MSS. of writers
who have had only a limited success.
This critical service has proved of great
value to many whose work, through
minor faults of construction or presenta-
tion, has just failed to get publication.
Mr. Cronin’s Story-writing Course is
fully described in an illustrated pamph-
let, “Writing to Win.” Copies will be
sent post free to any reader of The
Bulletin who would like one. Those
specially interested in the criticism of
MSS. or in the writing of newspaper
articles and paragraphs are requested to
mention the fact.

nard Cronin, c/o E. H, Welford, 398

A Practical Course for
Practical Men and Women
PELMANISM is concerned with personal attributes and quali-
ties. which are fundamental. They may be sleeping or only
partly developed, but they are in every normal individual.
Pelmanism develops them, separately and together, so that amongst
other things concentration is made easier by quickened perceptions ;
natural energy enormously increased by interest, and prompt
decision justified by soundness of judgment.
Amongst these attributes and qualities are:
Concentration
Judgment
Decision
'ower
Initiative
Self-Confidence
Presence of Mind
Organising Power
Cheerfulness
And a Reliable Memory.
The development of these strong, positive, vital qualities contributes
to one’s earning capacity, and makes it possible to live intelligently
in the present and build strongly for the future.
The People Who Take the
Pelman Course
There is only one kind of man who takes the Pelman Course,
but he is found in every calling and in every walk of life. He is
the man who wants to excel, who will not be deterred by circum-
stances, who will live intelligently and strongly, the man who will
reach out and take the good things that every age and every
occupation offer to him who has the wit and courage to take them.
AN ACCOUNTANT states that Pel-
manism has shown him “how to
overcome that paralysing feeling
of inferiority.”
A SHOP ASSISTANT reports that
he has secured a better position,
and attributes this to Pelmanism.
A FARM-WORKER writes: “Thanks
to Pelmanism, I am feeling more
confident and more alive.”
A MANAGER reports an increase
in Self-confidence, “which has
brought me the respect of my
colleagues.’"'
AN ENGINEER writes: “I feel
especially an increase in Self-confi-
dence, which gives professional
status.”
A CLERK writes that he has im-
proved in memory, concentration
and will-power, and that his mind
is quicker and more alert.
A WOMAN CLERK writes: “I can
concentrate for quite a long period
without my mind wandering. I
observe things far more quickly,
and have ever so much more confi-
dence in myself and my abilities.”
A TEACHER writes: “This Course
has had a remarkable effect on my
physical and mental health. What
pleases me most is the certainty
that I have lost my fear. My
Self-confidence has returned, and
my whole outlook on life seems
to be reconstructed.”
A BANK CLERK writes: “This
Course has enabled me to see
clearly what I want in life and
how to get it. It has taken me out
of the rut.”
Thousands of similar letters from all
over Australia and New Zealand
could be printed did space permit.
“pELMAN I S M,”
says Dame
Sybil Thorndike,
“gives mind-exercise
scientifically. It not
only improves, but
actually discovers,
qualities that would
otherwise have re-
m a i ned dormant.
Pelmanism gives a
mental clarity and
alertness that sees
opportunities an d
uses them rightly.”

“Pelmanism,” says
Lord Riddell, “is
rapidly becoming
part and parcel of
our daily lives.”
Lord Riddell did
splendid work for
England at the
Peace Conference.
His War Diary ex-
cited great interest.
“Pelmanism,” Dr.
Norwood, of tlie
City Temple, Lon-
don, says, “is sound
Psychology and an
admirable system of
Mind-training. Pel-
manism teaches that
man has the key to
his own career and
enables many to
find the key itself
which, for want of
self-knowledge, had
gs
lain undiscovered.” l)r. *. VV. Norwood, D.l>.

I HEARD A DOZEN RADIOS
THEN I PICKED A TASMA"
WANTED a radio set which would get me EVERY station —
distant as well as near—and 1 wanted to hear Interstate
broadcasting just as clearly as the local.
“I wanted a set which would mind its own business, so that I
could turn a dial and bring in what I wanted. Tinkering round,
ringing up for a man to ‘fix’ something, apologising to my
guests for funny noises, etc., do NOT appeal to me.
“1 wanted a set which LOOKED as good as it sounded. A cabinet
which required no excuses—one which I could be proud of, and
one my friends would admire. t
“I wanted, finally—because money matters to me—a set at a
moderate price. Well, I saw them all, heard them all, com-
pared them all—and bought a TASMA. It gives me perfect
reception ALL THE TIME. All the stations I want come
through easily and clearly. Fve got 100 per cent, reception and
all I demanded. Fve got a Tasma.”
