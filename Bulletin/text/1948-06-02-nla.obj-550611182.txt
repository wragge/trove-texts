SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS,THE GATEWAY TO BRITAIN
SOUTHAMPTON, primary passenger port of the United Kingdom, home
•5 of the great liners Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary, is, to thousands
of visitors from overseas, the gateway to Britain. At Southampton visitors
receive their first impression of the country, and when they leave Southampton
bids them farewell. From Southampton the Pilgrim Fathers set forth in
the Mayflower on their quest for the New World. From here, also, during
World War 11, millions of Allied servicemen set forth to free the world
from oppression. .
The recorded history of Southampton begins with the Roman invasion,
when it became a settlement and a port. The remains of a Roman fort
established to protect the river entrance can be seen to this day on.the bank
of the River Itchen. After the decline of the Roman Empire the Saxons
controlled the settlement at Southampton known to them as Hamwic or
Hamptun, from which the name of Hampshire may have been derived

Southampton was destined to pass through many stormy phases before the
present era began. The town was ravaged by the Danes and later occupied
by Sweyn of Denmark, whose son, the famous Canute, is said to have
£buke/the waves at Southampton, resulting only in the wetting of the
It was during the Norman regime that Southampton really began to
flourish, when a medieval town took shape and was surrounded by walls,
which can still be traced and portions of which are in a good state of
preservation. Owing to its excellent harbor, the town continued to grow
j n size and importance. The fleet of the Crusaders was partly assembled in
the port under Richard Cceur-de-Lion, and in the reigns of Edward 111
a nd Richard 11, it was one of the chief ports of embarkation for troops
engaged in foreign wars. Again in 1415 Henry V marshalled his army

WOUNDED BIOGRAPHY.
Douglas Goldring in The Last Pre-
Raphaelite (Macdonald), a life of
Conrad’s collaborator Ford Madox Ford,
is willing to wound and not afraid to
strike. And since those who are chiefly
stricken are women in general, Americans
and Conrad, his book is likely to trans-
form readers who are women, Ameri-
cans or admirers of Conrad into some-
thing like bulldog ants.
Mr. Goidring’s antipathy to the female
sex arises from the fact that two of the
ladies who figured in Ford’s life have al-
ready written books about him, and these
memoirs do not, he feels, do justice to
his late friend: “I doubt if any woman,
however loyal %nd affectionate, however
clearsighted and perspicacious, can ever
see a man, especially so elusive and com-
plex an individual as Ford, except in
the slightly distorting mirror of her own
emotions.” Upon thi,s monstrous state-
ment, which would imply the unfitness
of women for fiction as well as biography,
Mr. Goldring may be left, with a certain
amount of male sympathy, to the lionesses
whose rage he will arouse.
Since what remains of the unfortunate
biographer will undoubtedly be torn to
pieces by American reviewers, on this
count, too, he may be left to his fate.
Such statements as “It is in no sense a dis-
paragement of Americans in general, or
of Ford’s American friends in particular,
to point out that there is something about
Europeans which eludes the comprehen-
sion of the transatlantic mind” will doubt-
less be regarded as sufficiently disparag-
ing ; all the more so since Ford, as a
novelist, was more or less ignored in
England while the Americans gave him an
income, a home and a reputation. It will
also doubtless be noted that even Henry
James, whom Ford worshipped, becomes,
when he annoys Mr. Goldring, “our
American guest.”
As to the charges against Conrad, which
trail through the biography like a
wounded python, there is no need to do
more than quote in rebuttal Ford Madox
Ford. Mr. Goldring, beginning his on-
slaught, writes:
In spite of his partially German origin,
his French sympathies, his long residence
in the United States, Ford remained an
essentially English writer, just as Henry
James remained essentially American and
Joseph Conrad essentially Polish.
There is, of course, nothing really
criminal in being Polish; but let Ford
speak:
He [Conrad] was a gentleman adventurer
who had sailed with Drake. Elizabethan:
it was that that he was. He has been called
Slav; he has been called Oriental; he has
been called a Romantic. He was none of
these except on the surface, to his grocer.
....The irresistible feeling one had about
him was that he was practical, that the
last thing that he was was a Slav. For
the Slav, to be true Slav, must be as help-
less as is a newborn kitten, a greyish
sprawling object, mostly jelly. A sort of
Dostoieffsky!
Mr. Goldring, continuing, touches on
his theory that Conrad’s letters —those
marvellous pictures of the struggle and
triumph of genius—drove Ford Madox
Ford to a nervous breakdown:
In all his letters written about this time
Conrad harps on his favorite theme of
misery, depression, ill-health, distaste for
any form of literary exertion, agonising
struggles to discover the mot juste, titanic
wrestling with an implacable fate, and his
general “morbid condition.” As Ford was
extremely impressionable these incessant
caterwaulings from Conrad must have had
a thoroughly bad effect on his own “state
of mind.”
“Caterwaulings” is, of course, almost
irresistibly provocative. As is a sub-
sequent reference to “moaning and wail-
ing.” But, quoting again from his
Joseph Conrad, let Ford reply;
It is most characteristic of Conrad that
when, after five years, he and the writer
got to the last paragraphs of Romance and
when the writer had written: “For suffer-
ing is the lot of man,” Conrad should
have added: “But not inevitable failure or
worthless despair which is without end:
suffering is the mark of manhood which
bears within its pain the hope of felicity,
like a jewel set in iron.” He had the mark
of manhood!
But Mr. Goldring is at it again. One
of Ms extraordinary remarks is, “Had
Conrad spent his childhood in England
he would have gained much from the
nursery commandment to ‘look on the
bright side’.” Looking, then, on not quite
the brightest side of Ford’s association
with Conrad, he observes:
Occasionally, owing to Conrad’s iras-
cibility, or to Ford’s irritating manner, the
two friends would quarrel and have
“words.” The “words,” we may be sure,
came mostly from Conrad, as Ford suf-
fered acutely from anything in the nature
of a scene. Even the mildest tiff seems to
have prostrated him for days. •
“Words” there may have been; but
hardly, if we are to believe Ford Madox
Ford, even allowing for some humorous
understatement, of a “prostrating” kind:
There ensued a desperate wrangle as to
whether saffron had any flavor —in the
course of the consumption of curry. Con-
rad declared that saffron had no flavor;
the writer, that saffron was one of the
most strongly-flavored of all possible herbs.
Conrad swore that he had carried whole
cargoes of saffron; he had spent his life
in carrying cargoes • of saffron; he had
known no other pursuits. The writer on
the other hand had given more saffron to
diseased poultry than ever Conrad had
carried Conrad’s eyes flashed danger-
ously; his white teeth under his drawn-
back moustache. We both contemplated
Calais Sands. Someone changed the con-
versation to pearls In all our ten thou-
sand conversations down the years we had
only these two themes over which we quar-
relled: as to the taste of saffron and as to
whether one sheep is distinguishable from
another.
This sort of backchat between Mr.
Goldring and his own hero could go on
for ever; but presumably enough has
been quoted to show that Mr. Goldring
has himself fallen into the trap which he
fears besets the path of women writers:
seeing Conrad, if not Ford, “in the
slightly distorting mirror of his own
emotions.” Mr. Goldring’s “basic quali-
fications” for the art of biography, of
being “at least both English and a male,”
are, it appears, intensified to the point of
being a disadvantage.
There was, of course, no need for all
this peevish and insular banging of the
mighty shade of Conrad. Mr. Ooldring,
essentially, is merely wounded because
Ford’s reputation was swallowed in
Conrad’s. That, since Conrad turned out
to be one of the greatest of all English
novelists—in some respects the greatest—
was inevitable; and Mr. Goldring might
as well have accepted the inevitable as
Ford himself did, with a rueful and
humorous grace. To prove that Ford
was an estimable writer on his own
account it was not necessary to suggest
that Conrad was the devil in person.
Whether or not The Last Pre-
Raphaelite will succeed in establishing
a separate reputation for Ford —he has
always been conceded outstanding merit
as a stylist—remains to be seen. If the
specimens of his poetry quoted (the sort
of “free verse” written in the Imagist
period and amounting, as poetry, pre-
cisely to nothing) are overpraised and if,
as far as his fiction is concerned, one
hesitates to accept the assertion that he
had “genius,” Mr. Goldring will at least
persuade most readers that Ford’s
Tietjens novels, based on his experiences
in the 1914 war, are worth examination.
And, rather surprisingly, he will also
persuade the reader that The Last Pre-
Raphaelite, with all its faults, is a bio-
graphy both creditable and enjoyable. It
would be a pity to be aroused by Ivlr.
Goldring’s wounded extravagances to
the point of hurling his book out the
window, or into the nearest Feminist
Club, or across the ocean to America.
For the biography, if somewhat cumber-
some in style, is genuinely interesting ;
and not only in an incidental way, be-
cause it brings in Henry James (accept-
ing with delightful courtesy presentation
copies of Ford’s books without, it appears,
ever going so far as to read one of them)
—not only because it brings in W. H.
Hudson, Wells, Galsworthy, Shaw, Ezra
Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Gertrude Stein
and other notabilities or notorieties, but
because it is remarkably successful in its
central purpose as a portrait of Ford
Madox Ford.
Ford was a very curious character. He
began life, in 1873, as Ford Hermann
Hueffer. With testamentary benefits from
two rich uncles in view—hopes never,
alas! to be realised —he became, at an
early age, Ford Hermann Joseph Leopold
Hueffer. Then, adding to his name the
lustre of his maternal grandfather, the
pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox
Brown—who figures captivatingly in Mr.
Goldring’s biography as an old gentle-
man perched near the ceiling on a barrel
as he worked at an enormous canvas
that reached right across the longest wall
of his studio—Ford became Ford Her-
mann Joseph Leopold Madox Hueffer.
Finally, after the 1914 war, all this was
simplified—not before it was time —to
Ford Madox Ford.
The changes of name are significant.
Ford was a wayward and elusive per-
sonality, given to making rash statements
about his schooldays at Eton ; an institu-
tion which he did not attend. Occasion-
ally, by way of variation, he spoke of
the “old days” at Rugby—another school
at which he was unknown. Mr. Goldring
is right, and very pleasingly human, in
refusing to be aroused to moral indigna-
tion at these flights of fancy, but his'
wrath at the term “pathological liar”
might have been reserved for the “liar.”
For Ford was, it is certain, a little mad:
mad with the desperation of a man bom
among the geniuses of the pre-
Raphaelites, chosen for collaborator by
the genius Conrad, thrust among men of
genius and great talent when he edited
the “English Review” (the contributors
to the first issue included Conrad, Hardy,
Henry James, Galsworthy, Hudson,
W. H. Davies and H. G. Wells), and all
the while feeling that his own talent was
unequal to the great company it kept.
When a man calls himself, as Ford did,
“the finest stylist in England” he may,
conceivably, mean it; but more likely
he is whistling to keep up his courage.
Few of his contemporaries, says Mr.
Goldring, liked or admired Ford. That,
in his lifetime, was understandable; his
uneasiness among great men revealed it-
self sometimes in undue familiarity, some-
times in malice and most frequently in
insufferable patronage. But, as revealed
in The Last Pre-Raphaelite, he emerges as
a pathetic character; “this rather miser-
able exceptional man,” as Wells called
him. Possibly that was why he left in-
structions in his will that no one was to
write his biography. Mr. Goldring’s justi-
fication for ignoring the commandment
is not only the “public interest” that he
claims, but that Ford comes out of his
book as not only pathetic but gallant.
He fought in the trenches; he brought
out one of England’s greatest literary
magazines; he wrote books all his life ;
he won success (in America) at the end;
he never lacked style. And, after all,
Conrad must have liked him.
Essays by Jung.
A minor pleasure to be derived from
Professor C. G. Jung’s Essays on Con-
temporary Events (Kegan Paul), trans-
lated by Elizabeth Welsh, Barbara
Hannah and Mary Briner, is the rolling
of tremendous polysyllables. The late
Adolf Hitler is described on page 15 as
“a prodigious personification of all human
inferiorities” ; and on page 30 the totali-
tarian State of Hitler or Stalin is summed
up as “the agglomeration of all the non-
entities of which it is made up.”
Besides indicating the kind .of verbal
music—or, at any rate, noise—to be en-
countered, these two thundering phrases
serve also to illustrate the subject-matter
of the book and the doubts and de-
lights which are aroused by Jung’s appli-
cation of psychoanalysis to politics. For
the totalitarian State is undoubtedly an
“agglomeration of nonentities,” but
whether or not Adolf, was really “a pro-
digious personification of all human in-
feriorities” is open to question. Jung
himself qualifies his dictum by adding
that Hitler was “cursed with the keen
intuition of a rat or a guttersnipe”—
which seems merely an evasive way of
saying that he had genius of a kind. It
would take, after all, a tolerably pro-
digious rat to shake the foundations of
the world.
We find, later on, that Professor Jung
thinks that Germany, surrendering to
the mythical archetype, was possessed by
Wotan, the god of storm and frenzy;
and here, without explicitly stating so, he
is surely implying that Hitler was an
embodiment of that nasty and violent
deity. Adolf would, therefore, be not
so much “a personification of all human
inferiorities” as a personification of
Wotan ; he would have not a “rat’s in-
tuition” but that of a German god.
But this theory, if more acceptable
than the first, has its own weakness.
Reading Jung, as when toiling through
the works of other psychoanalysts, one
has at times the uncomfortable suspicion
that he is merely stating commonplaces
in metaphysical language ; that he is go-
ing a very long way round to come back,
essentially unenlightened, to the point
from which he started: that Hitler was
an unpleasant man who led the Germans
into war, that the Germans are a peculiar
and warlike people, and that the ways of
man are mysterious.
And the conclusions, sometimes, appear
not merely commonplace but erroneous.
Psychoanalysis always sounds impres-
sive :
The upheaval of mass instincts corre-
sponds to a compensatory move of the ,
unconscious. Such a move became pos-
sible because the conscious state of the
people had become estranged from the
natural laws of human existence. Because
of industrialisation, large parts of the
population became uprooted, and they were
herded together in large centres. And be-
cause of this new form of existence —with
its mass psychology and its social depen-
dence upon the fluctuation of markets and
wages—an individual was created who was
unstable, insecure and suggestible.
But if, as it appears, Jung is trying to fix
industrialisation and the decline of re-
ligion as the cause of modern wars, one
cannot help recalling that, long before
Watt and the steam-engine, people fought
very happily, and persistently, with
swords and bows and arrows.
One prefers, on the whole, Wotan ; or,
better still for an explanation of war,
the chapter where Jung talks quite simply
and like a layman about the “combative
instincts” of mankind.
One piece of information at least, and
an extremely valuable one. Professor Jung
has learned from his practice as a psy-
choanalyst, and he applies it with equal
force to the “totalitarian demons” and
the “terrible childishness of reformers”:
the fact that “all that can really be ac-
complished is an infinitesimal step for-
ward in the individual’s moral nature.”
All About Trains.
As a means of rendering the younger
members of the family absolutely insuf-
ferable The Australian Book of Trains, by
J. H. and W. D. Martin (Angus and
Robertson) has much to recommend it.
The large, handsome volume contains,
it is true, dozens of photographs as in-
nocuous as they are attractive: photo-
graphs of all types of trains, of course, in-
cluding one of the engine named Essing-
ton Lewis, which the authors refer to in
the text, not altogether tactfully, as “this
breathtaking monster” ; photographs of
great bridges and viaducts ; of sinkholes
in the Nullabor Plains, of Stanley Chasm
in the Macdonnell Ranges, of Mrs. Arneas
Gunn’s Roper River, of the rugged Haw-
kesbury country of N. S. Wales—all of
which amount, roughly, to a pictorial
survey of Australia.
But, chiefly, it is a book of information.
All about trains; Everything about trains.
And he who reads it will inevitably bail
his parents up in a corner and ask them,
with an air of triumph, “Do you know
that the cowcatcher is practically obsolete,
and do you know why?” “Do you know
some day we may see train-ferries
on Sydney Harbor?” “Do you know
that in one stretch of 300 miles in the
Nullabor Plains the ground level varies
less than three feet?” “Do you know, and
if not why not, what the dead-man’s
handle is?” “Do you know that the N. S.
Wales Railways lost £200,000 through
thefts last year?” “Do you know that
water for the first N. S. Wales locomotives
was supplied by a milkman at Is. 6d. a
cartload?”
Since any normal man, subjected to
such a barrage of invaluable information,
will undoubtedly leave home, it might be
better, perhaps, to read the book yourself,
herd the children into a corner, and drive
them mad.
And, indeed, to anyone who has read
this compact, comprehensive and com-
mendable compendium, the gratuituous
divulging of information is tempting.
Very tempting. Do you know, for in-
stance, why one electric train never bangs
into the back of the one before it? Do
you know how the Spirit of Protest got
its name? Do you know that South
Australia was the first railway system to
provide roller-bearings on every wheel
of a locomotive.and tender? . ..

Racing greyhounds reach their
prime when they’re 30 months
old and usually remain at their
peak for 3 seasons. Occasionally
a good dog will compete with
equal success as a flat racer, and
in the field, and finish his career
as a useful hurdler. Most famous
Australian dog of all time was
“Terminus” which was whelped
in 1923 and won the Australian
and N.S.W. Waterloo Cups in
1925, the Victorian Waterloo
Cup in 1926 and the N.S.W.
Waterloo Cup in 1927. The most
famous “aged” dog is “Mick the
Monk”, who won hurdle races in
1940 and, as a 9 year old today,
is still racing.

What are liquid assets in a balance-
sheet ?
Broadly cash and all those things
which can readily be converted into
cash. No hard-and-fast rule can be
laid down as to which are liquid and
which are riot —apart, of course, from
cash and public securities. Thus
“shares in other cos.” might be very
liquid in some cases and hard-frozen
in others. There is also, generally,
a doubt about stock, which, as a
matter of fact, may be harder to sell
than the premises in which it is
housed; and the latter are never re-
garded as liquid.

umpires during a match ?
(1) The referee shall award a

ment, and at the first offence shall
either caution the player or order him
off the playing enclosure. For the

(2) Chief duty of the touch judge is
to indicate and hold up the flag
where the ball has been kicked out

goal-post and signal whether a goal
has been scored; and must inform
the referee when he observes foul

PEPPET PIECE
By
CEILMANN
UNLESS otherwise engaged (which
is, no doubt, always likely enough,
fortunately), the Recording Angel,
at least, could hardly have helped
hearing them coming into their heritage
for the day.
Laurie Fiji, his wife Nellie, their little
girl Bell, and Bell’s dog Leo. Making
along the edge of the lagoon towards the
sandhills and the beach ; and all of them,
including Leo, breaking the stillness with
their voices, and surely amazing it and
the Recorder with the color of their
language.
Not altogether impressive heirs to
such a heritage. Brown skins of their
blackbirded ancestors well enough for it;
but dressed in cast-off-looking clothes
helping to make them seem to shamble
along in their single-file order, as they
had emerged by the track through the
scrub of paper bark ti-trees and those bur-
lesques of trees the gnarled old banksias.
Coming out into the wide-open from
where the fringing straggle of lantana
ends the scrub and the sand takes over,
Laurie in front with his big surf-board
on his shoulder, then Nellie, then Bell.
Nellie carrying a half-kerosene-tin bucket
with the swimming togs and fishing-lines
in it. Their clothes of sorts hanging
loosely on them. A march of scarecrows,
Dog Leo, by contrast, superbly dressed
in his liver-red coat. By contrast, too,
extravagantly alive. Racing about, bark-
ing. Toeing-up spurts of sand in his
twisting gallop. A fiery outrider with
the morning sun on his coat; starting up
flights of seagulls and making the swift
sandpipers race for their lives at his
ringing voice.
A week-day: hence the whole horizon-
circled world empty but for them and
the primitive things belonging to it. A
still world touched with unreality. Caught
in light flung from over the border of
insanity. A vast amphitheatre half-
enclosed by the circling line of distant
low ranges. A world in itself. The
stained lagoon its heart drunk in a pool
of wine. The dun sand a damp path
along the lagoon’s weedy brim, rising
back to the clean white sandhills. Wide
blue sky; the sun swimming in it in
his waves of gold, and a thin, wind-fluted
spear of cloud pointed up from the
south. Over the sandhills the beach, the
sheer humped headland and the sea; and
the black rock of the Island in its white
wash a couple of miles offshore.
A far immensity cast in stillness; so
that the voices of the shamble-trudging
trinity and red Leo sound like echoes or
ventriloquism. Singularly oathy Echo;
peculiarly profane Ventriloquist. A
general gabble; but the free swearwords,
by the particular physical strength be-
longing to them, singling out by them-
selves. Seeming to go skipping like flung
pebbles across the dark lagoon. Surpris-
ingly, without striking brimstone sparks
on it. Not even making a ripple.
The flotilla of two and a half pelicans,
the couple of older birds and the young
one, paddling away purposefully but
without any hurry. Evidently in no great
haste to ' get out of earshot. Perhaps
they’ve been so well brought up that they
wouldn’t know. Maybe they’ve never so
much as heard of a censor, or a Customs
man, or a Judge. Or perhaps they may
even do a bit of swearing themselves at
times; banging the boards of their bills
together when the fishing isn’t so good.
And—who knows? —perhaps the im-
agined Recording Angel might weigh such
reasons as poor fishing, and other things,
at least an ounce or two in the balance.
Or perhaps he, the Recorder, really
doesn’t worry very much about jotting
down the sayings of such inherent sinners
as old pelicans, or red Leo, or even the
single-file making away from the lagoon
to their right, heading up over the climb
of the wind-smooth sandhills towards the
beach,
After all (one so good himself and
reasonable as the Recorder might feel),
they are only Laurie, and Nellie, and little
Bell, and Leo. They seem to have a great
liking for swearing (the Recorder might
think); but is that, honestly, anything for
my Book? Phew! (he might say), that’s
a bit ripe, especially from one Bell’s size ;
but what can you expect when they take
one her age to listen to their kanaka
Salvation Army entertaining and saving
souls outside the pub-and-store? Not to
be wasting good ink and wearing out the
overworked quill, surely the right point
is: Are they swearing at Us ? Quite
obviously they are not. They are swear-
ing at everything. They are just swear-
ing.
I AURIE is swearing about his new
J' surf-board. He’s quite wrong about
it, of course. It’s not at all the best
so-and-so surf-board ever made, so help
him; not by a long shot. Anyone can
see that that’s just nonsense. It’s certainly
a very nice piece of cedar, with a beau-
tifully traced pattern in the grain, and
not so badly shaped considering the tools
he had. But look at that split in the
back end of it! And those axe-marks,
You needed at least an adze, Laurie. The
best surf-board in the world my foot,
Still, if you think it’s the best, Laurie,
what else is it?
And what more are you swearing
about? By the living Harry and so
forth, tke best day for going out to the
Island this (decidedly singular) year, so
help you, etc. What about last Tuesday?
As a matter of fact, last Tuesday was the
first really perfect day for going out to
the Island since Captain Cook himself
was along this way. Seas like rolling
mountains to ride up over on your
board. As you’d have known yourself,
Laurie, if you hadn’t been otherwise em-
ployed up the River, trying to draft that
cleanskin heifer out of Thompson’s
Jersey herd. They don’t teach you things
like that at the Salvation Army. Plenty
of fencing and ringbarking and corn-
pulling and other jobs in your line, too,
Laurie, if you would only get over your
slight distaste for work. Not that- that
isn’t understandable,
And as if you could have got away
with it, anyhow. There isn’t a cocky
on the River that wouldn’t know a
Thompson Jersey on sight. You’d have
ended up down in Maitland jail, along
with Pullet Days, that’s what would have
happened to you. You’d have had some-
thing to swear about then. Swinging a
hoe in the jail vegetable garden, like poor
old Pullet, with a warder perched up with
a rifle on the prison walls. You’ll cop it
properly one of these times, Laurie, if
you don’t take a pull.
And you, Nellie. Harping away harder
than ever now you can see the Island
from the ridge of the sandhills. Surely,
woman, if the man wants to go out there
the best thing’s to let him go and be rid
of him. You’d have been rid of him for
quite a long time if he’d managed to draft
that Jersey heifer. Really, Nellie, you at
any rate should have known better. In-
stead of urging him on ; because you’d
like that green parasol in the pub-and-
store-shop-window. What on earth use
would a green parasol be to you, anyway,
Nellie? So you could put it up to go
from the tent to the chooks’ pen when
it’s raining? And be carrying with you
for that flash Mary Levuka to see when
you go past their place with Laurie?
And because you just like green.
Well, yes, Nellie.
But the Island out there. As you say,
there are sharks, and one of these days
one of them might get him ; but it isn’t,
as you choose to express it, that anyone’d
think he had a so-and-so of a woman out
there. Not a stray mermaid within fifty
miles of it. Just as you can see it away
out there for yourself going down the
sandhill slope to the beach. Round and
black like a priest’s hat that’s' been
dropped in the sea, with the waves smash-
ing about its rim. Nothing but a bigger
black .rock than those fallen down this
side of the headland, where you’re mak-
ing for, to undress.
And as for Bell (it may be hoped the
Onlooker would conclude), a pumice-
stone cut on a heel with the sand work-
ing in it all the way calls for some sort
of salve. And for red Leo ; well, what
are dog licences for if a dog can’t swear,
if he wants to, at seagulls and pelicans
and sandpipers and rolypolys? After
all, they, and the crashing surf, and the
wind, and Echo in the headland are all
making a fair bit of noise at him.
Thus the Recorder (it may be hoped).
At all events, red Leo is still racing about
unchecked in his free independence as
Laurie lets his surf-board fall on the sand
and the three of them go in to their un-
dressing place among the high rocks.
Nothing much to take off, any of them.
Laurie pulling off his grey-flannel shirt
and old Working trousers and sandshoes,
Nellie and Bell getting their washed-out
print dresses over their heads. The
clothes thrown in a rag-heap on a flinty
ledge of the rock.
All three of them changed from more
than their clothes. A difference visible
about them. Entering into their beings.
Stirring the earth-drawn moods in their
bodies. Changed creatures. Adam and ‘
Eve and what came after; before some
of the stock took a bleaching.
LAURIE filling his lungs and making
his muscles stand out on broad
shoulders, till he looks like a sculptor’s
model for an Apollo. Slapping saddle-
muscled strong thighs. Stamping his feet
up and down. Combing his black hair-
waves back through his fingers. A
lighter-formed statue in bronze beside
him. Nellie’s pointed hands on her
slightly sharp hips. Going up on tiptoes.
arching her body forward towards him.
Shaking her cropped brown hair. Both
of them looking on all they see of each
other, and finding it good. Little Bell,
with no such time to waste, changing at
once into her red scrap of bathing rig.
Laurie in grey trunks, Nellie cased in
her fondness for green, they come out
again on to the beach. Two of her
fingers hooked in the top of his grey
trunks, Nellie has given up the fight
against his going out to the Island. Look-
ing anxiously out over the fairly high
seas running. No antagonism, but a
tinge of fear in her voice: “Mind you
watch yourself, Laurie. Bad sea soon,
that.”
Laurie laughing. At her; at the sud-
den thunder of a big breaker; at the
challenge shouted in his ears. Sure of
himself. Making her hang on and run
with him to meet it. The surf-board a
red feather on his brown shoulder.
Laurie going straight on, out with his
high-held board through the breakers. In
his element. Throwing the buoyant board
on to the waist-deep wave. Forcing his
way up and over the crest. No lines with
him. Nothing. Whatever his quest may
be at the Island it isn’t fish. What is it,
today, or any other of the days he’s gone
questing out there? The Island a bare
rock ; low enough for the high seas to
wash most of it; but bigger and higher
by a good deal than it seems from the
beach, though only a speck in the im-
mensity of its setting.
Laurie riding high and going suddenly
out of their sight from the beach. High
on the next crest and over. A dot out
there getting smaller, till it’s lost altogether
against the background of the rock, long
before he reaches the Island.
AT his Island, Laurie will come up
out of the sea. Climbing with his
board up ledge-steps on the lee side.
Going up the sloped top to where the
centuries and the seas have balanced
hurled rocks in a cairn at the higher end.
A wall-shelter from the wind. There the
hot sun drying and warming his body.
Laurie looking back to the wind-speared
cloud pointed high now from the horizon
to the south. By the height of it knowing
he had better be getting back. Not want-
ing to go. Not yet a while. Not want-
ing to break out of the spell that brought
him here. A magic much too strong for
you, isn’t it, Laurie? Going back through
what drowned ages, to what other far
specks of islands scattered over the
Pacific?
This rock is black, and the magic black.
Working its spell on you as the day goes
forward and the weather in the sudden
south is making up. The wand in the
hand of a painted magic-maker, springing
up in front of the cairn. Not old Prospero
in his gown. No Ariel fluting here. Noth-
ing fanciful at all, Laurie. The elemental
rock a drum for the crunching thunder of
the sea. The wind finding wild strings
in the air to play on. Heady warmth of
the sun. Drowsy salt smell of the rime.
Curved smoothness of the rock. The
cairn a shade for your head. Good to
lie here with the warmth of the sun creep-
ing over you. Tasting the sea in your
mouth. A bit of a sleep, Laurie. A part
of the rock.
NELLIE and Bell and tireless Leo tiny
toy specks away along the beach
in the hunt for seaworms. “ ’Bout five-
shillings-worth,” Nellie reckons, in the
tin. Bending down over the little tigerish
faces sticking their heads up through the
wet sand as the wash runs out. Hooked
fingers jerking the long bronzed seaworm
from his quicksand home. Bell as adept
in the quick knack of it as Nellie.

CIRCUS.
Arc-lights and sawdust, perched on a
bench the children
With tiptoe faces and mouths at O
For paint and pulleys and piebald horses,
Seals and clowns and the to-and-fro
And roll-me-over of barrel-organ music.
An egg-shell dazzle —a paper hoop.
“Mother !” “Father !” Words like pop-
corns
Exploding wonder. “He jumped right
through !”
Change the cloth for a garden backdrop,
Enter the Dancer to a waltz-time tune.
How candid cheapness plucks at the heart-
strings !
Remember the garden ? Oh love, the
moon !
Enter the willowy Hunter, courting
His dove, his darling, his fugitive one.
Faster the music , brighter and brighter,
Into the hoop. Together. And gone.
Here comes the jungle, padding on the
sawdust:
Lions and tigers, tremendous, sly,
Rearing, towering, crowding round him.
ENGLAND.
Man, with his whip of wisdom high.
Clawing, tearing, spotted and sinister;
Smell of the jungle. Serpent and beast.
Into the hoop with them, out to the cages,
Bolt shot home and padlock fast.
Somersaulting wonder. False-nosed pie-
face.
Jumping-jack with his mouth turned
down,
With stock-in-trade of tears and laughter,
Beloved, clumsy, woebegone clown.
Here is he whom we come at last to —
Pay your shillings and take your seats
The Greatest Show on Earth awaits you —
An age-old mummer with a bag of tricks.
Everyman , listen, there’s a circus story —
Enters the bell-tent a noble lord,
Monocled dandy, exquisite gentleman,
Yawns as he watches, a trifle bored.
Sweat, clown, clutch at a heartbreak antic,
The false-board trapdoor gapes to Hell,
Strain for the hoop if you hope for
Heaven,
Who comes is Death, and he’ll have his
will.

OLD PETER.
Old Peter across the hills has wandered
home
To a canvas-chair on Callemondah’s cool
Verandah; across the epic of the years
Has gathered eighty winters in his beard
And wisdom in his hands.
His thousand curses lie involved in fur-
rows ;
His thousand dreams with the grey smoke
lose their way
On silence, and his one great love, with
the wind’s
Warm sound in the grasses, rushes sing-
ing down
His blood and leaps like fever to his eyes.
When cattle in the casual hills call dumbly
Through the trees and with awkward
shuffles humbly seek
The valley in the afternoon, he counts
Their silhouettes against the gully twi-
lights,
Follows them along the track and sees
Them through the sliprails; with a cap-
tured gesture
QUEENSLAND.
Of brown hands slaps them into the
clicking bails
And talks of bitter seasons he remembers.
Of death and dust, of sharp bone break-
ing the hide.
And crows encircling desolation. Beyond
These silky-oaks he built his first defence
Against a wilderness, and deigned to
stay;
Mastered his span of earth in a way and
rode
The hills till the land gave up its secrets.
harshly.
And the farm was won.
And now from riding his boundaries this
side
Of heaven old Peter has wandered home,
v and rivers
Of sunset, flushing the channels of the
clouds
In final flood, deluge hill and valley.
Earth and the heart, with a god-light of
regret.

CAT E R PILLAR Dteset
tractors help shift 3,000,000 yards of over-
burden to win 1,000,000 tons of coal!
Dominant in'the extracting of 333,400 tons of coal per year from
the Muswellbrook Open Cut Mine toils a fleet of "Caterpillar” D 8
Tractors and "Caterpillar” Earth-Moving Equipment, operated by Thiess
Bros. Pty. Ltd., one of the largest contracting firms in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Working week after week, month after month, these "Caterpillar” Diesels
are mustered to maintain a regular output of over 2,000 tons of coal per
working day. This has entailed a shifting of 3,000,000 yards of overburden,
the hauling of huge s Super Rippers and Scrapers employed over the flint-
like surfaces. Also the powering of tireless Front End Loaders and Dozers,
operating to win for the industries of Australia no less than 1,000,000 tons
of coal in less than 35 months.
Transporting the coal from the open cut to railhead calls for "Caterpillar”
No. 12 Diesel Motor Graders. These maintain existing roads, cut and grade
new areas as the work progresses, repair road damage caused by the ,wear
and tear of heavy machinery around the immediate approaches of the
mine and construct drainage ditches around the cut.
Here is still one more project of vital national importance demanding the
nigged construction, tireless energy, easy mobility and sustained power of
"Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors and "Caterpillar” Earth-Moving Equipment.
And Thiess Bros. Pty. Ltd. add their name to the thousands of contractors
who, in every part of the world, have proved that "Caterpillar” Diesel
Tractors can "buy” themselves with fuel-£’s saved whilst giving that
dependable performance which keeps the contract always ahead of
schedule, no matter how immense the task, or how gruelling the terrain.

ASTONISHING MARSHALL PLAN.
London “Economist,” in a
striking article cutting through
the mass of Kremlin-made pro-
paganda against the Marshall
Plan, has set out the essential
character of the Plan as it will
no doubt pass into history—one
of the most inspiring efforts in
the interests of humanity that
the world has seen.
“Men lose their capacity for
astonishment very easily,” the
“Economist” comments; with
the Plan now in actual operation,
approved by Congress and the
ships already sailing with sup-
plies from American harbors, its
“fabulous quality” is lost sight
of.
Hitherto sharply critical of
American policies, the London
publication now suggests that
people, especially the peoples of
Western Europe, “should
attempt to renew their capacity
for wonder,” so that they might
return to the U.S. “a gratitude
in some way commensurate”
with this “act without peer in
history” ;
“In time of peace, in order to
aid nations geographically re-
mote and politically separate
from the Americas, at a time of
great internal shortages, the
United States is ready to give
away over five billion dollars’
worth of commodities as the first
instalment of a wider pro-
gramme, to give them for peace-
ful economic reconstruction and,
save for minor exceptions, to
give them without political con-
ditions of any sort.
“A year ago,” the “Economist”
adds, “the project would have
been inconceivable —Congress
was then making desperately
heavy leather over only 400
million dollars for aid to Greece
and Turkey. Ten years ago
such an initiative would have
driven the nation en masse into
the arms of the America First-
ers. And search back as one
may through the annals of the
United States or of any other
Power, there is no record of a
comparable act of inspired and
generous diplomacy.”
Commenting further that “it
will be difficult, after this de-
monstration of international
solidarity, to go on repeating the
old jibes about American iso-
lationism, the old complacent
references to American political
immaturity,” the “Economist”
declares that, instead, “the
American public, in its eagerness
for information, its sustained in-
terest in foreign affairs, and in
its acceptance of positive and
onerous international responsi-
bility, is rapidly qualifying for
the title of the least isolationist
and self-absorbed of peoples.”
The “Economist” remarks on
the speed with which the bill
was passed through Congress:
“How often in the last 20 years
has the reaction of democracy
come too little and too late;
but this time the initiative has
been captured and held by the
party of freedom.” It rightly
names Russian actions —especi-
ally that in Czechoslovakia just
prior to the Congress debates —
as in part responsible for the
“breakneck speed, by American
standards,” with which the ap-
proval was given.
Just as significant, however,
was the fact that this should have
happened in a Presidential-
election year, despite which the
speed, in fact, practically broke
all previous Congress records.
The Senate opened its debate
on March 1, passed the mea-
sure on March 14, turned at
once to the aid programmes for
China and Greece-Turkey and
finished with approving them on
March 30. Next day the Bill as
a whole came before the House
of Representatives and the same
day was passed by 329-74—“ a
far heavier majority,” N. Y.
“Times” commented, “than had
been dreamed of two months
-N. Y. “Herald Tribune.”
AND EVERYBODY’S WATCHING IT!
earlier.” And a far speedier;
many had expected the debates
to go on for months, if only to
prevent Mr. Truman gaining
any political kudos from the suc-
cessful working of the plan be-
tween now and the November
elections.
A day later (April 1) House
and Senate conferees met to iron
out differences between their
measures (the House had
plumped heavily for including
Spain, but this was now
dropped). They worked until
midnight, and next day their
agreed measure was ready. The
House passed it by 318-75. The
Senate roared its approval in a
voice vote. And the day after
(on April 3) Mr. Truman put his
signature to it.
Summarised, this is what was
agreed to;
European Recovery Pro-
gramme. Economic aid for 16
European nations to the end of
June, 1952, is authorised; for
the first 12 months, beginning
April 1, the amount is set at
$5.3 billion. An independent
Economic Co - operation Ad-
ministration, responsible to the
President, is created to handle
the programme. Recipient
nations will be required by
treaty to co-operate to remove
trade barriers and stabilise their
currencies.
China aid. For the next 12
months $338 million in economic
aid, $125 million in military aid.
Greek-Turkish aid. For the
next 12 months, $275 million in
military aid.
While the China and the
Greek-Turkish aid allotments
have definite military purposes,
the London “Economist” article
makes the important point that
the main measure approved, the
European Recovery Programme
(Marshall Plan), involves no
military or strategic commitments
whatever, though there are cer-
tain reciprocal financial and
other such undertakings by the
countries benefiting. Altogether
the measure was approved as
originally conceived, a “funda-
mentally constructive and paci-
fic” effort; as the “Economist”
emphasises, a measure “for the
peaceful economic reconstruc-
tion of Europe.”
Congress made the aid con-
ditional on “strong production
effort, expansion of foreign trade,
creation and maintenance of in-
ternal financial stability” among
the participating European
countries. The preamble to the
E.R.P. Act adds: “It is further
declared to be the policy of the
United States that continuity of
assistance provided by the United
States should at all times be de-
pendent on continuity of co-
operation among countries par-
ticipating in the programme.”
As well, there was the pro-
vision of certain undertakings to
be entered into by the various
countries separately. This did
not come out at the time of the
Congress discussions, but a state-
ment on it was drawn from Sir
Stafford Cripps in the House of
Commons on May 6. His state-
ment is worth giving since cabled
versions of it were somewhat
confused:
We have signed a Letter of
Intent, and it contains four points,
which are as follows. First of all,
that we adhere to the purposes and
policies of the Economic Co-operation
Act; secondly, that we intend to
conclude a bilateral agreement with
the United States of America in
accordance with the Act; thirdly, that
we will take the necessary steps to
make deposits of sterling proceeds,
commensurate with the dollar amount
of assistance furnished under the
grant, in the Special Account that
will be opened into which will be paid
the sterling equivalent of the dollar
grants for the goods that are, of
course, subsequently sold in this
country; fourthly, that we have
signed the Convention for European
Economic Co-operation which set up
the O.E.E.C.
By these we are bound and by
nothing further. The next stage will
be for us to enter into a bilateral
agreement with the United States of
America, and that has not yet been
negotiated, much less signed.
When the time comes to discuss it
we shall have, of course, to consider
carefully what obligations we under-
take. The provisions of the Act of
Congress deal with agreements by
which the participating countries will
agree to do certain things themselves.
There is no suggestion of any outside
control over their economy, nor, I
am sure, is any such thing contem-
plated under the Act.
Commenting that “for the sake
of peace in Europe, it must be
hoped that, as the Plan develops,
its pacific character will become
more and more obvious, Russian
opposition will decline and the
effectiveness of Communist op-
position be hamstrung by grow-
ing economic prosperity,” 'the
“Economist” raises the question
as to whether then, under such
conditions, the U.S. Congress will
be prepared to vote the further
appropriations necessary to con-
tinue the Plan through its four-
years schedule: “Will Congress
find the Plan a sufficiently worth-
while end in itself? Will the
prospect of continuing a pacific
effort of international reconstruc-
tion be compelling enough to call
forth further dollars?”
The answer, it holds, now lies
in one thing only—the way in
which the European nations
themselves go about their work
of recovery; “The operation that
lies ahead is one that calls for the
last reserves of energy and skill
in the Sixteen Nations If the
results in 1949 are to be different
from,those of 1947, the Sixteen
must fulfil their side of the bar-
gain by solving together in the
closest collaboration the prob-
lems which eluded them as long
as they acted separately in 16
jealous and independent sove-
reignties. If they so act, there
is a chance of the Plan succeed-
ing in Europe. If they do not
their failure will spell the end of
Congressional interest and with it,
in all probability, the loss of the
later appropriations.”
As to that, N. Y. “Times” has
published a long, detailed report
from a staff correspondent in
Geneva, the sum of it that, with
the exception of Italy and Ger-
many (both special cases), every
one of the countries participating
in the Plan has made greater
progress towards restoring pro-
duction than in the comparable
period following the earlier war.
The recovery, moreover, is
shown to have been most
marked in industries most im-
portant as a foundation for
general recovery: “Europe is by
no means dissipating its resources
in making useless trinkets.”
The big recovery already
made, the N. Y. “Times” report
adds, has largely been brought
about by “important measures of
international co-operation among
European Governments and in-
dustries,” matching the Marshall
Plan itself in dwarfing anything
of the kind hitherto known.
Anti-strike Law.
Introduced in America last
year to curb the abuses of over-v
grown labor-union power acting
against the community in general
—particularly through public-
utilities strikes like Sydney s gas
strike —the Taft-Hartley Act has
been reported by a special Con-
gress “watchdog” committee to
be working well.
Among the findings of the
committee on the first six
months of the Act were the fol-
lowing :
Most officers of unions have
filed non-Communist affidavits,
and in many cases members have
compelled officers to do so or
removed them.
A growing number of jurisdic-
tional strikes are being settled
without necessity of formal
action, and prevalence of such
strikes is declining.
Strikes, in number, in man-
days of idleness and in total
number of workers affected,
have steadily declined in each
successive month since the law
became fully operative on
August 22, 1947.
U.S. Showdown Note.
What has been called here the
American “showdown” Note to
Russia figured in considerably
varied and much-compressed
versions in cables, smothered in
a great deal of confusing com-
ment by interested parties and,
especially confusing, the Krem-
lin “acceptance” of the Note as
an “invitation” to a U.S.-Soviet
meeting to talk out “differences.”
As an example of that con-
fusing of a very plain business,
the “S. M. Herald” (May 12)
came out with a four-column
front-page sensation heading :
“Russians Agreed To Talks With
U. 5.,” sub - headed “Settling
Differences At Conference.” The
opening sentence of the cable-
report under those headings
(datelined “London, May 11”)
was : “The Soviet Government
has accepted a proposal from
the United States that the two
countries should open dis-
cussions' to settle the differences
between them, Moscow Radio
announced last night.”
Actually the Note, delivered
in oral form by U.S. Ambas-
sador at Moscow Walter Bedell
Smith, was the bluntest possible
denunciation of Soviet policies
and tactics. It has often been
contended that neither of the
two World Wars would have
started if other Powers had made
unmistakably clear to Germany
how they would react: the
American “showdown” Note
was designed to leave no pos-
sible doubt, or excuse for doubt,
in Russian minds regarding the
position taken, and to be main-
tained, by the United States.
That was its entire purpose, and
it could not have been plainer
or blunter.
The Note is of such outstand-
ing importance that it is here
given in full, as it was stated to
Molotov by Ambassador
Smith:
Two years ago during my initial
conversation with Generalissimo Stalin
and yourself, I stated as clearly as
possible my estimate of the inevitable
reaction of the American people to
the continuance of a policy by the
Soviet Government which would
appear to have as its purpose the
progressive extension of the area of
Soviet power.
At that time I pointed out that
it would be a grave misinterpre-
tation of the fundamentally pacific
character of the American people to
believe that they would not react
strongly and vigorously to the pro-
gressive domination by one country
of its neighbors and the clear threat

BY APPOINTMENT TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING
to the world community which such
actions would imply.
I emphasised at that time that the
United States had no desire whatever
to see the world divided into two
major groupings, nor to divert a large
part of its income to the maintenance
of a military establishment which sue
a world situation would necessitate in
elementary self-defence.
It seemed apparent then that such
a line of policy as that described
could lead inevitably to a crystallisa-
tion of the non-Soviet areas ot tne
world whose people would quite un-
derstandably feel themselves progres-
sively threatened by such develop-
ments.
It seemed also inevitable in such
a case that the United States, as the
strongest nation in this community,
would be forced to take a leading part
in this movement and to divert a
large portion of its energy, which
by preference our people would preter
to utilise for assistance in the recon-
struction of the ravages of the war
to the maintenance of a military
establishment adequate to meet the
developing world situation.
Unhappily the apprehensions I felt
at that time have been realised.
Since that date Soviet policy in
Eastern Europe has produced the
reaction which was predicted. The
situation which has resulted is obvi-
ously one of great seriousness.
The European community and the
United States have become alarmed
at the implications of Soviet policy
and are drawing closer together in
mutual self-protection, but only m
self-protection.
It is for this reason that my Gov-
ernment desires me to outline to you
with complete clarity and frankness
the position of the United States
Government.
There should be no mistake about
the determination of the United States
to play its part in these co-operative
movements for recovery and sett-
defence. The concern and the deter-
mination of the people of the United
States have been intensified by tne
inexplicable hostility of the Soviet
Government to the European Re-
covery Programme —a measure whicn
in its inception and subsequent de-
velopments is so obviously only a
measure of American assistance t
reconstruction on a co-operative bas
without menace or threat to anyone.
The situation which has been pro-
duced by the actions of the Sovie
Government or by political groups
obviously under its control, and tne
natural and inevitable reaction on tn
part of other countries, including tn
United States, to these actions is
obviously one of great seriousness.
My Government has no idea what
conclusions the Soviet Governmen
has reached concerning the present
attitude of the United States. It ha
noted that the picture of this attitude
given by the Soviet press is dangei-
ously distorted and erroneous.
Whether or in what degree the mem-
bers of the Soviet Government them-
selves believe this distorted version,
my Government has no means o
estimating. For this reason 1 wish
make plain certain points on whicn
my Government considers it extremely
important that there be no misunder-
standing at this time.
(1) The policies of the United States
Government in international questions
have been made amply clear in recent
months and weeks. They have the
support of the overwhelming majority
of the -American people. They win
continue to be vigorously and firmly
prosecuted.
It would be a grave error if others
were to assume that domestic con-
siderations, such as the forthcoming
elections, would in any way weaken
the determination of the United States
to support what it believes to be
right. The American people have
always known how to separate
domestic and foreign policy at the
proper moment.
Similarly, my Government is aware
that Communist organisations here
and there have been disseminating
propaganda to the effect that a forth-
coming economic crisis in the United
States will soon produce a radical
change in American policies. It is
hoped that no one will be so foolish
as to forfeit the chances of progress
toward world stability for the sake
of an economic prognostication which
has been proved wrong time and tune
again. Even those who persist m
believing such a prognostication must,
at the very least, realise that an
economic crisis would not affect in
any way our basic productive
capacity, nor our concept of the
basic factors underlying our foreign
policy.
It must be emphasised that the
present state of world affairs involves
issues which the people of the United
States consider to be vital to United
States national security and the world
peace. No one should deceive himself
as to the seriousness of United States
policy with respect to these issues.
(2) On the other hand, my Gov-
ernment wishes to make it unmis-
takably clear that the United States
has no hostile or aggressive designs
whatever with respect to the Soviet
Union. Assertions to the contrary
are falsehoods which can result only
from complete misunderstanding or
malicious motives. United States
policies have been so devised that
they «annot possibly affect adversely
the interest of a Soviet Union which
seeks to live at peace with its neigh-
bors and to refrain from attempts
to exercise undue influence, directly
or indirectly, in their affairs.
In fact, many of the elements of
United States foreign policy to which
the Soviet press takes such strong
exception today would never have
come into existence if it had not been
necessary for the United States to
aid other countries to defend their
own political integrity from attempts,
on the part of Communist minorities,
to seize power and to establish
regimes subservient to foreign in-
terests. Should these attempts cease,
the necessity for some of the mani-
festations of Uitited States foreign
policy, which apparently are unwel-
come in Moscow, would cease with
them.
The present state of United States-
Soviet relations is a source of grievous
disappointment to the American
people and to the United States Gov-/
—Washinxlon “Post."
“HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY, DEARIE?"
ernment. As far as we are concerned,
it represents a painful and undesired
alternative toward which we have
been driven, step by step, by the
pressure of Soviet and world Com-
munist policy.
We still do not despair by any
means of a turn of events which
will permit us to find the road to a
decent and reasonable relationship
between our two countries, with a
fundamental relaxation of those ten-
sions which today exercise so unhappy
an influence on international society
everywhere. As far as the United
States is concerned, the door is always
wide open for full discussion and
the composing of our differences.
My Government earnestly hopes
that the members of the Soviet Gov-
ernment will not take lightly the
position of the United States Gov-
ernment as here expressed. They
have it in their power to alleviate
many of the situations which today
weigh so heavily on all international
life. It is our earnest hope that they
will take advantage of these possi-
bilities. If they do, they will not
find us lacking in readiness and eager-
ness to make our own contribution
to a stabilisation of world conditions
entirely compatible with the security
of the Soviet peoples.
Atom Developments.
The cabled U.S. official an-
nouncement that “three atomic
weapons of improved design
had been successfully tested in
the Marshall Islands —“a mile-
stone in atomic development,”
with 10,000 men reported as
having taken part in the tests
represents part of what U. S.
News-World Report” has des-
cribed as the development on a
vast scale of the atom industry
in the U.S. “for purposes of both
peace and war.” Similarly the
earlier announcement of the
building at California University
of a giant cyclotron 20 times
larger than any existing atom-
smasher and alone costing
$19,000,000.
Stating it is a develop-
ment about which little is
known, the authoritative publi-
cation reports that “atomic
energy, without people quite
realising it, is growing into a
big new industry that can com-
pare with some of the other big
industries of the country.” Out-
lays for wages, raw materials,
new plant and equipment are at
a yearly rate of nearly
$500,000,000, and are due to go
up to $674,000,000 in the year
beginning next July. Construc-
tion of new factories, labora-
tories and housing for atomic-
workers is going ahead at
dozens of places throughout the
U S The payroll has already
reached 60,300 employees in the
industry, and is still expanding.
A report to Congress by
the United States Atomic
Energy Commission tells of
products added to the original
line of atom bombs and of ex-
pectations, including commer-
cial power from the atom within
two decades, treatments of major
diseases, aid to farmers and in-
dustry from atom by-products
and also new and handier wea-
pons of destruction. Chairman
of the commission David Lilien-
thal has stated that the U.S. had
“served notice to the rest of the
world that it intended to widen
its atomic lead still further.”
Radioactive isotopes, says the
report, are being mass-produced
for the first time. These are
materials such as carbon, iodine
or phosphorus that are radio-
activated in atomic piles, so that
they give off a steady stream of
radiation waves'. Principal uses
are in treating disease, as tracers
in medical research, as controls
in manufacturing processes.
Nearly 2000 consignments have
been sent to hospitals and re-
search laboratories, and 14
foreign countries are due to get
shipments.
Atomic medicine for treat-
ment of a variety of maladies,
including thyroid disorders and
some skin diseases, is being de-
veloped. Also aids for industry
with radio isotopes as tracers in
industrial processes. These
tracers, for example, can be
used to control thickness of steel
or aluminium sheets in rolling
processes. They can detect im-
purities in steel, leaks of soluble
gases. They can speed new pro-
cesses for making oil from coal.
Agricultural aids, too, are antici-
pated from wider use of isotopes
to investigate plant growth and
plant and livestock maladies and
help in producing healthier
crops and farm animals.
The report sees commercial
atomic power, at the present
rate of development, in sight for
the late 19505. The power is
expected to be in the form of
electricity generated from heat
of special atomic reactors. A
practical pilot plant for creating
such electricity from the atom
will probably be perfected for
use by industry within eight or
10 years. Commercial use of
atomic energy then could follow
in the succeeding decade, and
could be widespread by 1968 in
areas without a near-by supply
of coal or oil.
On the destruction side,
atomic-bomb production is being
changed to a sort of assembly-
line procedure. Output of
bombs is being kept up while
capacity for building them is
being increased. Many scientists
who worked on the war-time
bomb and returned to their uni-
versities afterwards are now back
aiding research.
Construction of plants, living
quarters and laboratories for the
atom industry in general is run-
ning into big money. There is a
$90,000,000 programme for
building research - laboratories
alone. At Hanford, Wash., a
small city is being erected for
15,000 atomic-workers, and the
plutonium-producing plant ex-
panded, the cost exceeding the
$350,000,000 that went into the
Hanford war-time installation.
At Los Alamos new construc-
tion includes public utilities,
nearly a thousand homes, new
weapons-research facilities, en-
larged bomb-production facili-
ties, with $23,000,000 more to be
spent on building in the year
ahead. A comparable pro-
gramme at Oak Ridge is ap-
proaching completion.
In addition, a metallurgy
centre is' going up at Miamis-
burg, Ohio; a basic nuclear-re-
search centre is started on the
site of former Camp Upton,
N.Y.; a $15,000,000 atomic-
power laboratory is under way
at Schenectady; and the “atom-
smasher” of record size is being
built at the University of Cali-
fornia.
Research to produce more
products for the atomic industry
is meanwhile going on in a
dozen major laboratories. One
is working on a small atomic
power-plant for propelling air-
craft, another an atomic engine
for ocean liners and warships.
Others are developing atomic
tools for industry and research,
and further products are almost
certain to result from basic
nuclear research by university
groups in three new “national
laboratories” at Chicago, New
York and Oak Ridge, as that re-
search produces a clearer idea
of just what the atom can do.
Dragnet Digest.
Palestine Less Popular. —Mr. Tru-
man’s remarkable acrobatics are not
the only twists on Palestine. N. Y.
“Times” reports what its dispatch
calls “a dramatic shift in the attitude
of Jewish displaced persons in West-
ern Germany.” The report states:
“Whereas until three or four months
ago a vast majority of these D.Ps.
wished to go to Palestine, 80 per cent,
of them now say that they want to
go to the United States, and they
specifically add that they do not want
to go to the Holy Land.”
* * * ♦
The Voluntary System. —No doubt
rather reluctantly, the British
Labor Government’s Political and
Economic Planning Committee finds
Socialism a little lacking in one re-
spect: “On average there is need for
two and a hall children a family
[to keep up Britain’s population], so
that the proportion of families with
three, four or five children will need
to be substantially increased. This
enlargement has to be secured by
voluntary means.”

Abdullah.— Not the Bul-bul Amir;
another Abdullah probably holds the
key to the fate of Palestine. By the
report of a British Middle East ex-
peit, in a London “Times” letter,
Abdullah is decidedly unlikely to have
ever made some of the statements
attributed to him in cables; the ex-
pert refers to him as “a good and
wise King.” An article by Abdullah
himself, published in an American
journal and made an “Unearned
Addition” some months back, sup-
ports that view. N. Y. “Times,” also,
takes no cheapjack view of him.
Abdullah’s kingdom of Trans-Jordan
was actually an original part of the
Palestine mandate. Britain set it up
as a separate Arab country in the
’twenties. And, says N. Y. “Times,
“Close ties remain between London’s
Foreign Office and King Abdullah.
The British pay the bills (£ 2 ,p o °,oW
yearly) for Abdullah’s Arab Legion,
by far the strongest Arab army in
the Middle East.”

Doubts on Japs. —Reporting from
Tokyo, the “Christian Science Mom-
tor’s” chief correspondent Gordon
Walker has stated that disclosures of
big-scale “hidden Government
manipulations have “fostered serious
doubts as to the degree to which
many Japanese political leaders are
accepting democracy.” Information
made public “indicates clearly that
at least some of the more influential
leaders in Japan today are striving
not only to block democratic ad-
vances but to revive or retain the
old system which brought war in the
Pacific.”

dent reports that before the elections

United Americas. Briefly sum-
marised, the results of the Ninth
International Conference of American
Republics at Bogota, Colombia,
were: (1) An organic pact for the
inter-American system, now to be
called the “Organisation of the
American States.” The pact is a loose
Constitution which codifies and com-
presses all previous inter-American
accords. (2) An anti-Communist
resolution, approved unanimously. It
states that “international Communism
is diametrically opposed to liberty,
and “deliberately foments civil strife,
internal strife and economic in-
stability.” It calls on the American
nations to take “all necessary measures
to impede and uproot [Communist!
activities.” (3) An inter-American
Defence Council. This will be a per-
manent committee of top military
men to consult on collective security
and mutual defence arrangements.

Communist Rights— ln his so-far
very successful campaigning for the
U.S. Republican party’s Presidential
nomination Stassen has strongly ad-
vocated outlawing the Communist
parly. To the cry that this would
not be in accord with democracy,
Stassen (as reported by “Christian
Science Monitor” correspondent Ros-
coe Drummond) replies that, just as
U.S. citizens, under the Bill of
Rights, have the right to carry arms
but do not have the right to form
themselves into an armed organisa-
tion or into a private army, so, while
citizens have the right to talk, write,
and advocate in behalf of Com-
munism, they do not have a Con-
stitutional right to organise in behalf
of Communism when such an organi-
sation is “a subversive arm of a
foreign Power.” Thus Stassen be-
licves it is desirable and Constitution-
ally possible to outlaw the Communist
party organisation without denying
to any American his rights of free
speech, free assembly, and freedom
of the press.

An absolute “must” in
new buildings to-day
Today’s architect is fully aware that he,
perhaps more than anyone else, can pre-
vent fire from taking its toll.
That is why, while the building is
still on paper, he eliminates fire as a
hazard by specifying “Grinnell Auto-
matic Sprinkler” protection.
Your architect today also knows
“Grinnell” meets the highest profes-
sional standards that he could demand.
Every “Grinnell” installation is tail-
ored , . . can be made a blended part
of a building’s design.
The services of Wormald Brothers’
experienced engineers are available to
architects, and managements interested
in “planned fire protection” for new
buildings.

EMPIRE THOUGHTS.
Although bitterness has never been a
British failing, the British nation may
warrantably have felt bitter when it sur-
veyed the world on Empire Day. During
three years of the “peace” that brought
merely a cessation of strife in one form
and an eruption of it in others, nothing
has gone right with the one country that
saw the wars through from the first shot
to the last.
Its domestic situation is bad and may
grow worse. That, at least, is the report
from Sir Stafford Cripps, the intellectual
leader of the body of doctrinaires into
whose hands Britain fell when its elec-
torate swallowed the Labor-socialist dope
previously swallowed by Australians.
The immediate financial consequences—
the only consequences so far analysed or
perhaps analysable—were losses of 30
millions sterling in a single year on
“nationalised” coalmines and airlines.
In a burst of candor Mr. Shinwell ad-
mitted that he had taken charge of the
coal case without bothering his head
about the medical history of the patient
or anything like that. He did not admit—
none of these socialist quacks ever does —
that there was anything wrong with the
treatment; and the treatment is to be ex-
tended to the iron and steel industries,
which, considering the very fine produc-
tion records these industries have estab-
lished in very discouraging circumstances,
looks perfectly mad. Meanwhile Mr.
Strachey, an accomplished wordspinner,
does his best to reconcile the people to
a monotonous diet and to answer the in-
terjector who asks him plaintively for an-
other war “so’s we can get something
decent to eat.”
Abroad, the position is, if anything,
worse. The changes that three years have
brought are staggering to those who can
remember the great ceremonies and the
mighty displays of power with which the
Empire celebrated the old Queer’s
diamond jubilee, India, “the brightest
jewel in her crown,” has gone, and with
it Burma, so recently and painfully re-
conquered, and Egypt. Palestine, a prize
of the 1914-18 war, has been abandoned,
not to the Turks, from whom the Im-
perial armies took it, but to the Arabs
and a few hundred thousand Britain-
hating European Jews, who owe their
very presence in the region to the bene-
factor they revile, and whose terrorists
threaten the life of the Foreign Secretary,
if not those of the King and Queen and
the Heiress Presumptive themselves.
Latin American republics serve de-
mands on Downing-street for the
“return” of “unredeemed” territory
they never owned. It is becoming
common to read in some cocksure rag
or to hear from some radio oracle that
the only two Powers now in the world-
picture are the United States and the
U.S.S.R., and that the only thing left for
Britain to do is to side with the one—in
the process accepting dictation of
monetary policy as well as foreign policy
—against the other.
A poor destiny for a country which
had become great in every sense of the
word centuries before America ceased
to be inhabited wholly by savages and
Russia by barbarians whose Tartar over-
lords had the odd habit of building
pyramids of skulls to commemorate their
victories. It will not be accepted.
A great survival value Britain has al-
ways had. It may have a greater survival
value still than either the U.S.A., which
in the ’sixties went very close to separa-
tion into hostile Slave and Free States,
and the U.S.S.R., which has extended its
lines dangerously, and which has, still to
endure the shocks inseparable from the
death of a dictator and the efforts of
perhaps a score of Amuraths to succeed
Amurath and keep down the subject
peoples—Finns, Poles, Czechs, Slovaks,
Ukrainians, Rumanians, Bulgarians, and
right across Asia to Korea —which hate
the whole outfit. Apart from the Asiatics,
over 400,000,000 of them, who have
known the benefits of the British peace,
and have by their own free choice re-
tained the association —a touching and
magnificent tribute, even should separatist
tendencies prevail in the end —there are
70,000,000 people who speak the English
tongue, are loyal to the King and all he
stands for, and will hot see his heritage
wasted, his and theirs. And seventy
million English-speaking people can’t be
wrong, nor can they be put down or rele-
gated to insignificance.
Nor is Britain’s situation as bad as it
might have been. It would be immeas-
urably worse had Neville Chamberlain
yielded to the imbeciles who urged him,
often with foul insults and imputations
of personal cowardice, to make his Britain
—still in the painful process of recovery
from the first German war, in which the
flower of the nation perished, and the post-
war depression—to become “the knight-
errant of the human race”; to speed to
the rescue of Red Spain, at the price of
alienating all the Catholics in the
Americas, and dear old Czechoslovakia,
which seven years after Chamberlain’s
death fell to the Reds without a
struggle.
When Chamberlain judged that there
was no alternative to war a united Empire
stood behind him, except for the Com-
munist pollution, and the non-totalitarian
world agreed that the Empire’s cause was
just. It reacted in that spirit. And the
hour of danger brought the Man —a Man
whose words to his people were “I have
nothing to offer but blood, sweat and
tears.” He knew his people, that Old
Man, the old “Tory,” and their response
to his appeal to their pride of race and
country and the spirit of sacrifice will be
preserved always as one of the high
heroic chapters of history.
Instead of a Churchill Britain might
have had a Chifley. He would have
addressed his adjuration to “the workers”
and promised them everything they asked
for, together with a resumption of the
war against “the capitalists” once the
foreign foe was defeated. Britain in its
extremity was spared the invocation of
cupidity and class hate ; but the “policy,”
devoid of moral principle, has been in
full operation in Australia. It has led
to foreign relations —first with the Dqtch,
and now with the Greeks —being dictated
by Communists from the waterfront, and
to sections of “the workers” employing
methods of ape-like malignity against
fellow-Australians, Judging by the result
of the prices-and-charges referendum, the
Australian people has had more than
enough of these measures and methods
and will welcome the first opportunity to
consign the Cfiifleys to a situation in
which they can never again sunder the
nation and add to the other evils they
have inflicted on it.
Watch and Ward.
By any standard of past British demo-
cratic Government it is utterly wrong
that Mr. Ward should have been per-
mitted since last January to retain
control over the two departments of the
Crown which he administers. The more
upright his conduct, the greater his
capacity for his office, the more promptly
should he have wished to hand over his
portfolios until the charges in the New
Guinea affair were disposed of.
At a press conference Mr. Chifley re-
fused an inquiry into allegations made
against this Minister, and added that:
He watched the administration of Gov-
ernment departments pretty closely. All
Ministers consulted with him on admini-
stration. “I do not believe the charges
against Mr. Ward and never have. I have
complete faith in Mr. Ward’s honesty.”
Then he quoted one sentence out of
Judge Stacy’s summing-up.
One sentence; there were several
others, including an observation from the
Bench which hits the mark in the question
all-important to the people at large;
The history of the case (said Judge Stacy]
started in 1944, and this gigantic fraud was
not shown up until December, 1947. One
cannot help but wonder how it could last
so long. There were rumors at an earlier
stage....
Yet the Prime Minister kept “a pretty
close watch” on departments, and even
now he has nothing but “complete faith
in Mr, Ward.”
There are only two deductions to be
made from this attitude. Either Mr.
Chifley is indifferent to an amazed and dis-
satisfied public opinion, or the standards
he looks for in the conduct of State affairs
are utterly different from those traditional
in the public life of a British democracy.
It does not matter for the moment —and
The Bulletin is not here concerned with
the point—whether the evidence given
against Mr. Ward was true or false, or
whether there was a conspiracy or not
(which has yet to be tried). What does
matter, and matter seriously to a demo-
cracy concerned to preserve the upright-
ness of its elected rulers and the highest
standards of public administration, is the
revelation that because of the Prime
Minister’s personal confidence in one of
his Ministers, that Minister is allowed to
continue in office while charges invidious
to his administration are not yet disposed
of.
The Judge in comments on the Garden
forgery case said: “Mr. Ward might have
known nothing about the matter at all;
he might have been involved as Garden
had sworn, or he might have had some
inkling But he is not on trial.” And
again: “If the whole of Mr. Ward’s
evidence was false and if they (the jury)
believed that he was concerned in the
matter ‘up to the neck,’ how would that
affect the [present] issue?” —the issue
which the Judge had expressly fined down
to the question whether or not Garden
committed forgery in the alteration of and
signature to one definite and produced
letter.
Mr. Chifley’s attitude in this matter
is of the gravest moment to every Aus-
tralian, and not least to his own poli-
tical reputation. Taking the most ele-
mentary and personal reaction from it,
it does not seem to matter to him that
administration of the Department of Ex-
ternal Territories has not been cleared —
and it must be cleared —of allegations of
most dangerous laxity that cannot be
ignored. Not so did Mr. Chifley’s erst-
while leader, John Curtin, treat im-
putations against departmental adminis-
tration when he suspended Mr. Ward
from his former office of Labor and
National Service while investigation was
made of alleged extraction of documents
from an official file in the “Brisbane
Line” case. Not so did Mr. Menzies, in
the Administration which preceded Mr.
Curtin’s, treat the charge that his Minister
for Customs, Mr. Lawson, had leased a
racehorse from a citizen who was in-
terested in a Government licence to
manufacture motor-cars. And who was
more active than Mr. Ward in con-
demnation of Mr. Lawson, resigned
though he had, in that instance?
This administration which Mr. Chifley
“watches pretty closely”—is it of so high
a standard, and does Mr. Chifley himself
admit of no laxity? For more than 12
months Opposition speakers have been
rebuffed in every effort to expose Com-
munist infiltration of Government de-
partments. Mr. Chifley’s stereotyped
reply to questions is either that published
allegations in the Press have quite escaped
his attention, or else that he is satisfied
from private or departmental inquiries,
and so much is enough. He is due to be
reminded specifically of leniency in his
“watching,” and of misstatements in
admission of faults, which are gravely dis-
turbing at this juncture as revealing an
atmosphere of indifference in the highest
quarters:-
Last April Mr. Chifley was confronted
with a fully-documented charge in the
House against an inspector in Mr. Chifley’s
own Land Sales Control sub-department
of the Treasury who, as a law-clerk, had
been formerly convicted in 1940 on 10
charges of forging, uttering, and false pre-
tences. On release from prison this man
sought employment in the N.S.W. public
service, was rejected, applied for employ-
ment with the Commonwealth Public Ser-
vice (Land Sales Control Board), was
accepted, and shortly became the personal
delegate of the Commonwealth Treasurer.
In a delayed, written reply, Mr. Chifley
said he had ascertained that “one of the
officers” in the L.S.C. Office had served a
term of imprisonment for “an offence of
the nature referred to by the honorable
member.” He had been appointed to work
‘‘for which his known qualifications
appeared to fit him.” The question of his
future employment was “receiving atten-
tion.” “He is not now acting as a dele-
gate.”
Last November (as Mr. Beale, M.P., told
Mr. Chifley in Parliament) “a high official”
in the Prices Branch was prosecuted on a
blackmarketing charge over the rent of a
house. Certain Crown witnesses against
the accused, who had already furnished
written statements concerning the commis-
sion of the offence, refused to answer
questions on the ground that they might
incriminate themselves, and the case col-
lapsed. Mr. Chifley had no answer to
make to these representations.
There has been the gross ill-treatment
of innocent and estimable citizens in
the Australia First internments, notably
in the cases of Bath and Harley Matthews.
Presumably Mr. Chifley watched all this
travesty of justice “pretty closely.” The
Keane Trunks Case, if “watched,” was
never fully investigated publicly. Then
there are the frequent instances of in-
efficiency and misbehavior in Govern-
ment departments and “boards”—fuel-
rationing provided a recent example.
Add the great extravagance in post-war
Government departments, as well as the
enormous inflation in the Commonwealth
civil service—all at a cost to the com-
munity in money and manpower. This
aspect of administration, if we can take
Mr. Chifley’s word, he must be watching
“pretty closely.”
On what standards, therefore —it must
be asked —does Mr. Chifley judge the
competency and rectitude of administra-
tion under his leadership? What does
“watching administration pretty closely”
amount to if the New Guinea affair
could go on for three years without the
Minister-in-charge being aware of it or
the close-watcher, either? And when did
Mr. Chifley first hear of it (“I never have
believed the charges,” he says)? He must
have known of them when he met Dr.
Evatt in Sydney on Dr. Evatt’s return
from abroad last December ; when in New
Zealand he received that Evatt telegram,
“All quiet on the Western Front”; and
when he met Dr, Evatt again on return
from New Zealand, Did he never, from
then onward, at any rate, have any stir-
rings whatever of doubt whether Mr.
Ward should or should not temporarily
relinquish control of his two depart-
ments?
One suspension did ensue all right.
The State executive of the A.L.P. had to
get busy last month, “after friction for
some time past,” with the Darlinghurst
branch of Mr. Ward’s East Sydney elec-
torate, of which Garden was president
last year. It suspended the branch “while
full investigation is being made of its
affairs.” This was a step “most unusual
and done only in exceptional circum-
stances,” commented one official.
But to “Labor” the standards of ad-
ministration of a party branch are appa-
rently of much more concern than those
in administration of national affairs.
Western Union.
Quite apart from any wider significance
it may ultimately have as part of a scheme
for European Union, the agreement
signed a few weeks ago by Britain, France
and the Benelux States is an important
step towards European and world re-
covery. The countries concerned form a
bloc of a magnitude that cannot be
ignored, with resources that are formid-
able by any standards.
The total population of the group is
107 million—highly industrialised and
with a fine standard of technical skill.
Numbers do not mean everything, but,
excluding underdeveloped China and
India, only the United States and Russia
exceed that figure. In industrial re-
sources the group is well supplied with
all the requirements of heavy industry
except oil. Current figures are of little
value in this respect, but a glance at
pre-war statistics will bear out the claim.
The coal production of the group in 1938
—not a record year, but fairly typical of
pre-war production —was 315 million
tons, about 2\ times that of Russia and
not much short of American output for
that year.
British mines were responsible for
most of this output, but France contri-
buted 46 million tons, and Belgium and
Holland between them almost as much.
From the iron-mines of the group 50
million tons of ore was won in 1938,
France supplying the lion’s share, 33 mil-
lion tons, Britain 12 million and Luxem-
bourg five million. Portion of the
French and Luxembourg production
went to Germany, but the iron and steel
industry of the five Powers turned out
in 1938 nearly 16 million tons of pig-iron
and over 20 million tons of steel. These
figures were lower than the peace-time
output of the United States, but higher
than that of Russia.
In the engineering and shipbuilding in-
dustries the group is very strong; except
for America’s mammoth war-time pro-
duction, Britain has always been the
world’s most important builder of ships,
and that industry has been one of the first
to recover from war-time conditions.
Holland’s shipyards have a considerable
output; before the war she ranked fifth
among nations, two of the countries that
exceeded her production being Germany
and Japan, whose return to pre-war
figures is not likely to be rapid. Then
there is the shipping industry; Britain
is still the biggest ocean carrier, and the
merchant fleets of France and Holland
play an important part in the economy
of those countries.
As to textiles and light industries the
group is remarkably equipped, and
Britain, France, Holland and Belgium all
possess specialised branches of industry
turning out goods which command
quality prices in any market.
The strength of the Western Powers
does not end with a recital of the re-
sources of the home countries; the four
main partners are all colonial Powers.
Holland’s' rich possessions in the East
Indies, although not yet recovered from
the effects of Japanese occupation and
subsequent political upheavals, are still
immensely valuable and must be ranked
high on die list of her national resources.
Britain, France and Belgium between
them control the whole of colonial Africa,
with the exception of the Spanish, Portu-
guese and Italian possessions, and are
pushing ahead with vast plans for the
development of that continent. Oil is the
main deficiency in the home resources
of the group; but they have a big voice
in the control of the oilwells of the world.
The full significance of Western Union,
political and economic, is not yet clear;
difficulties and pitfalls are bound to be
considerable. But the potential strength
of such a union is impressive.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Labor" Should Resign.
The Chifley Government on Saturday, in
the overwhelming rejection of its request
for permanent Federal price-control
powers, received from the people a crush-
ing vote of no-confidence. Any Parlia-
mentarian less pachydermatous, less pig-
headed and less adhesive to a Socialist
trade-union machine than Prime Minister
Chifley would immediately consider resign-
ing. It is quite clear that the people are in
no way opposed to continuance of price-
control in circumstances reasonably de-
manding it; but they are angry and
resentful at the Socialistic intent that is
the motive behind Canberra “Labor’s”
demand for more powers,
Chifleyism and Communism stand in
the way of economic recovery in Aus-
tralia. Both are violently afflicting the
people’s nostrils. Taxation and “controls”
are killing initiative, and it is plain that
only vigorous private enterprise can do
the job of housing, feeding and clothing
the people adequately and developing the
country.
The decisive “No” vote in all States
at Saturday’s referendum ballot means
(says Dr. Evatt now) that the electors
prefer that price-control should be ad-
ministered by the States. How chastened
is he in his views!
It means something more in Barton and
in the Prime Minister’s constituency of
Macquarie, in both of which the Govern-
ment’s Socialistic request was hfeavily de-
feated. Mr. Chifley took a few days off
before commenting on a vote which, not
only in Macquarie but throughout Aus-
tralia, flatly rejected his representations as
stated on the eve of the poll: (1) that per-
manent price-control was necessary, (2)
that it could not be left to the States and
(3) that the Government had no ulterior
motives in asking for this permanent
power. All the battery of propaganda
about rack-renters, about chaos from an
abandonment of Canberra regimentation,
and about the pure-souled Socialist ideal
of protecting people, “whether they agree
or not,” was in vain. People assessed it
at its true worth.
The Chifleyites know now what is in
store for their socialisation programme,
which they have made the plank of their
political existence, as exemplified by the
Bank Grab Act. They are on the way
out. Their leader forfeited all trust in
himself when, last year, he pretended that
he had a mandate for socialisation be-
cause (as he said), although it was not
mentioned at the 1946 elections, it had
been on the “Labor” platform for 25
years, and the people must therefore have
voted for it when they elected “Labor”
to office.
Not only in that particular, but also in
its toleration of the Communists’ de-
predations—and its readiness to act as
host to these deadly political parasites—
has the Chifley “Government” betrayed
this democracy. The electors are justified
in their refusal to trust that “Govern-
ment” with any further powers whatever.
If a general election were held tomorrow
the Canberra Socialist crowd would go
out on their necks. This referendum was
never anything as detached and unpoli-
tical as Mr. Chifley and Dr. Evatt pre-
tended. It was a test of the Govern-
ment’s standing with the people, and was
taken on the best ground the Govern-
ment could choose. A “Yes” victory
would have been received by the Socialists
with shouts of rejoicing as a warrant
for pressing on with every socialistic
scheme on the “Labor” platform.
By the same token Mr. Chifley ought
now to abandon his bank-confiscation
Act, reconstruct his “free-medicine”
scheme in frank co-operation with the
medical profession, and insist with the
unions upon higher man-hour production
as a fair return for improved union wages
and conditions. But he won’t; nor will
he interfere with the Communist pro-
gramme for sabotaging Australian in-
dustry in the interests of the same revolu-
tion at which (in its Canberra guise) the
electors have just thrown a heavy brick.
In the result he will shatter the
“Labor” party as well as his “Govern-
ment” ; and many in that party, uneasy in
advance, must have registered a lively
resentment by voting “No” on Saturday
—especially in Queensland.
Swing-back in South Africa.
“J. 8.8.” on another polling-day:
News of the defeat of the Smuts Government
by Dr. Malan’s Nationalists caused some excited
London correspondents to cable forecasts of
South Africa’s early secession from the Empire.
This is extremely unlikely. There is nothing
new or surprising about the landslide; it simply
reproduces a situation which arose nearly a
quarter of a century ago, when Malan’s former
chief, General Hertzog, defeated Smuts, who,
first as Botha’s lieutenant and for five years as
Prime Minister, had been on the Government
benches from the formation of the Union. When
Hertzog took office in 1924 there were gloomy
prophecies of withdrawal from the Empire and
of an end to British influence in South Africa.
They came to nothing; Hertzog attended the
Imperial Conferences of 1926 and 1930 and
was ofle of the framers of the Statute of West-
minster, of which he said: “It lays a deep and
enduring foundation for national co-operation
by members of the British Commonwealth.”
The question of a Union flag raised bitter pas-
sions, and the Labor party, on whose support
Hertzog depended, as Malan will on that of the
Afrikaner' party, refused to agree to a flag which
did not recognise the British tie, with the result
that the Union Jack was included in the design.
The Nationalists certainly claim a Republic
as their ultimate objective, but the election was
not fought on that issue, and Malan has given
a specific undertaking not to attempt its intro-
duction without a referendum. The narrow
margin of his victory would hardly encourage
him to attempt this, much less to break his elec-
tion promise. In any case a two-thirds majority
of both Houses would be necessary to bring
about such a change, and he does not possess
that strength.
Considered dispassionately, the Nationalist win
is really a post-war swing-back to something
more like the normal peace-time set-up in South
African politics. Among Europeans—except for
a small number in Cape Province, colored races
do not have the vote —people of Dutch descent
outnumber those of British stock. In both
World Wars they rallied behind Smuts in suffi-
cient numbers to ensure South Africa’s playing
an effective part in the Allied cause; but in the
last couple of years, as in the early 1920’5,
there has been a reaction against Smuts’s pre-
occupation with Imperial and world affairs. The
outstanding characteristic of the old Boers was
their desire to be left alone. In their descen-
dants this trait shows itself in an isolationist
policy, linked with a suspicion that the English-
speaking element of the population aims at
swamping the Dutch.
This feeling was brought out strongly in the
Union Parliament about six weeks ago, when
Nationalists bitterly attacked the Government’s
immigration policy—nearly 30,000 immigrants
went to South Africa last year, most of them
from Britain. The Nationalists raised a cry
reminiscent of Australian Labor during its Oppo-
sition years—the newcomers were taking jobs
and land from the native-born; they would
lower the living standard; and so on. National-
ists also opposed South Africa’s participation
in the scheme to absorb displaced persons; anti-
Semitism was the main reason.
Distrust of the outside world has not been
lessened by U.N.O.’s attitude on two matters of
vital interest to South Africa —the future of the
mandated territory of South-west Africa, and
the position of the Indians in Natal. Almost
every South African now regards South-west
Africa as irrevocably part of the Union, and
Smuts, as one of the architects of U.N.0., prob-
ably has to accept—though unjustly—some of
the blame for the Assembly’s refusal in 1946
to agree to its formal incorporation into South
Africa. On the Indian question, too, South
Africa was snubbed by U.N.0., Our Foreign
Policy concurring.
Another factor that may have contributed to
Smuts’s defeat was hfs precipitate recognition of
Israel on the eve of the election; South Africa’s
100,000 Jews are not among her most popular
citizens. Malan is heartily anti-Semitic, and
Smuts’s hasty action, while not gaining him a
single Jewish vote —he had them already—may
well have lost him those of some of his former
supporters. The closeness of some of the results
—his own seat was lost by only 224 votes —
shows that a last-minute swing could easily have
been decisive.
In Opposition Dr. Malan has been bitter and
critical. He opposed the war throughout, and
fought the 1943 election on a peace-with-Ger-
many ticket, which was soundly defeated. This
time his platform was rather vague. He advo-
cates white supremacy, but opposes immigra-
tion, especially from Britain. He has a nebulous
plan for segregating the natives into reserves;
his opponents ask where the land is coming
from, as there are nearly 9,000,000 natives. The
Indians he proposes to send out of the country
—a difficult matter, as they number about
250,000, and were mostly born in South Africa.
He has threatened to dissolve the Communist
party and clean the Comrades out of the public
service; it is probable that he will do something
about this. He has also hinted at withdrawing
from U.N.0., a less likely action.
Like many before him, Malan in power will
probably be a somewhat different man to Malan
in Opposition, particularly as his majority is so
slim. The alliance with Havenga’s Afrikaner
party is not entirely cordial; a few unpleasant-
nesses that cropped up during the campaign
suggest that the two parties will not be in agree-
ment on all points of policy, and compromise
will be necessary. And whether or no Smuts
himself retires from politics, his party is still
strong enough to wield a big influence in South
African affairs.
Attack on Conciliation.
The Communists have only been waiting
for the referendum campaign to be over
before starting their next attack on the
community. It is pretty clear that they
mean to hold Australian industry and
householders to ransom by denying coal
generally and gas in the cities in order
to:
Procure amendment of Dr. Evatt’s
“streamlined-arbitration” system so as to
make Conciliation Commissioners entirely
subordinate to the unions.
Get all legislation—State or Federal —pro-
tecting the community against strikes abol-
ished.
The A.C.T.U. is, of course, lining up
with them. The headquarters staff of the
Communist strike-gang is now concen-
trating in Melbourne.
The thing they dislike about the Con-
ciliation Commissioners is that some
of them have refused to deal with a dis-
pute while the applicant union is on
strike. Commissioners, it is claimed,
should be compelled to revise any detail
of awards which the strikemongers dis-
like ; a union is thus to be free to strike
against such an award so long as it con-
tains anything less than a union has
demanded. “Union representatives” have
“called on the A.C.T.U.” to “ask the
Federal Government” to make this
“urgently-needed” amendment. So much
for Dr. Evatt’s scheme to prevent disputes.
The Communist union bosses have
already got the A.C.T.U. with them to
the extent of “warning those responsible
for legislation”—that is, those of his
Majesty’s Governments concerned —that
“anti-strike legislation” (such as Hollway
in Victoria and Hanlon in Queensland
have used to quell revolutionary strikes),
along with punitive provisions in the
Federal Defence Projects Act and the
Crimes Act, “constitutes a direct challenge
to ‘Labor’,” and “will be resisted with
full industrial strength.”
In face of the threatened gas shortage
in Melbourne the Victorian Government
has had to approve regulations reducing
the calorific value of gas in order to
stave-off rationing. On top of this, Mel-
bourne gas-workers—dutifully picking up
the Red torch from the Sydney men —
banned all overtime, forbade union mem-
bers to relieve staff members away on
annual or sick leave, and recommended
that no further negotiations for a settle-
ment be held under Conciliation Com-
missioner Blackburn, who has refused to
grant arrogant claims by the union
covering double margins, long leave and
preference to unionists.
Conforming, the Plumbers’ Union has
refused the Melbourne Gas Co.’s request
for permission to employ 60 dilutee
tradesmen, although the company repre-
sented that because of shortage of fully-
qualified tradesmen it could not give ade-
quate service to gas-consumers.
Hollway comments that he is watching
the position and he “hopes wise counsels
will prevail.” He will not, he declared,
“be deterred by any bluster of Com-
munist trade-union leaders who are en-
deavoring to retain their positions by
stirring-up trouble.”
Wool and Wealth.
Brisbane wool-sales closed last week with
Queensland price records broken —96|d.
a pound for greasy—and buyers rushing
the final catalogues with bids averaging
5 p.c. to 1\ p.c. above the previous week.
Sydney sales opened on Monday on a
slightly subdued market, though there
was evidence that the run of high prices
was far from finished. It’s all very nice
and comforting to read that wool will
probably earn more than £l4O million
for Australia this season, but wool men
are not so pleased. Mr. Langmore, the
Longreach (Q.) man whose fleeces made
that 96? d., said wool prices were too
high ; growers would sooner have a stable
(if lower) price than a fluctuating one,
and somewhat bitterly remarked that, in
any case, they were only handling the
wool for the taxgatherer.
Others aren’t happy, either —notably
the Bradford wool trade. In London, as
in Australia, Russian and Russian-satellite
buyers appeared with large orders and
elastic limits, though how the wool is
to be paid for isn’t entirely clear. Brad-
ford has to pay the high prices or face
idle machines, since France, Switzerland,
Norway, Japan, Italy and America are
all hungry for wool. And Bradford is
affected by the awful lassitude of Aus-
tralian wharfies, the languid turn-round
of ships slowing wool deliveries, so that
many firms have to buy on a spot basis
in order to get supplies to keep the
machines running.
London “Economist,” somewhat
startled by the rising prices, considered
the question of whether wool was being
bought as a sort of substitute currency
by countries whose normal currency is
depreciating, and remarked:
It is, however, difficult to assess the extent
of such dealings—if indeed they have
occurred. There are undoubtedly some
speculative forces in the market, though it
is doubtful how far they are fostered by
currency considerations alone. In a rising
market buyers usually tend to purchase
more than their immediate requirements.
British eyes are on the Soviet invasion
of the wool-market. It is doubtful if
Russia ever bought more than 30,000 or
40,000 bales of Dominion wool in any
year before the war, whereas, even before
its appearance at Brisbane, it had bought
around 150,000 bales this year. The sus-
picion is that either Russia is building
up stocks as part of a preparation for
war, or she intends an attack on world
textile markets .with a planned export
scheme —in pre-war days the Soviet did
this sort of thing on a minor scale with
wheat.
American woollen manufacturers are
no happier than Bradford about the posi-
tion, as is obvious from the subdued
American interest at recent Australian
sales. All the same, the American Wool
Council has its eye on the “cold war”
and the possibility of it becoming a “hot”
one, and has taken the trouble to issue
an estimate of “army wool uniform
fabrics and clothing required for an army
of 1,500,000 men, and partial reserves for
an additional 800,000 men,” based on
what the Quartermaster-General ordered
in June, 1940—18 months before Pearl
Harbor:
Scoured wool required in various grades.
44’ s 13,212,0001 b.
50’s 3,052,0001 b.
56’s and 58/60’s .. .. 23,658,0001 b.
60’s 16,359,0001 b.
64’s 41,227,0001 b.
97,508,0001 b.
The A.W.C. somewhat drily observes that
the foregoing is “presented as a matter
of information; not as any indication of
possible further requirements by the
armed services.” As far as U.S. civilians
are concerned, it is said they will resist
the higher prices for wool clothing which
must follow high prices for raw wool,
and either buy fewer clothes or turn to
synthetics. Australian growers have
heard these threats about synthetics be-
fore, but the United States is somewhat
fickle when it comes to clothing styles
and materials. Still, wool is almost as
badly needed as food throughout the
world, and nations concerned with de-
fence must regard it as a first-priority
munition.
Sustained demand is for the finer quali-
ties, of which Australian production is
falling. The yield of 64’s and finer fell
by about 40 p.c. between 1940 and 1947,
and so far there is no sign of any strong
increase—any old ewe is worth her weight
in gold today and buying fine-wool
breeders is almost out of the question;
mutton and lamb prices are at record
levels.
All in all, from the Australian view-
point, this may be pleasing enough, and
the Federal Treasurer, who, as Prime
Minister, is now gloomily contemplating
the referendum count, may find his dis-
appointment eased by the flood of tax-
money wool will earn. The grower’s
pleasure is tempered by thoughts of that
same tax-flood, and he can expect more
demands from union? based on reports
of record wool-sales ; generally speaking,
the grower will have a little more money,
but it won’t enable him to buy fencing-
wire, iron, veterinary supplies and a
thousand other things necessary for long-
delayed improvements because they are
not to be had. And pound-notes won’t
feed sheep if next season is dry. One
thing is clear: wool is once more proving
itself the best asset of a country posses-
sing, in many respects, more good luck
than good management.
Neglect of the North.
The shire of Cook, in North Queensland,
covers an area the size of Victoria and
has a population of 1132 people. Much
the same can be said of other areas up
north. North Queensland has so many
riches awaiting development that, were
the area ’in, any other continent, history
would tell of the wars fought for it.
History very nearly had to record an in-
vasion of the Japanese in 1942, when
North Queensland was —as it still is—a
vital Australian frontier. Yet the 1947
census showed that, whereas the popula-
tion of some larger centres like Cairns
and Townsville had increased, that of the
rural areas had fallen to an alarming
extent —alarming, that is, to anyone con-
cerned with the Australian future.
With something of this in mind, and
stirred by the apparent neglect of the
British Food Mission to examine their
country, 64 delegates of various organisa-
tions from Ingham to Cooktown and the
hinterland met at Cairns to see what
could be done about it. Every delegate
told what his district could do, what neg-
lect it had suffered, what it wanted —
ranging from claims to be able to feed
all Britain to a hope that Canberra might
make it a tax-free area. Blame for the
neglect of the North was put upon Bris-
bane and Canberra and resolutions de-
manding that the neglect should cease
forthwith will eventually reach their re-
spective pigeonholes in both cities.
This neglect is nothing new; it has
been going on for 60 or 70 years. Old-
time Governments neglected the place
with as much enthusiasm as do present-
day Governments. The reason is obvious
enough—it is so far away from seats of
government as to be, except at election-
time, a distant foreign land.
The cure is as obvious as the reason.
North Queensland should be a State, with
its own Parliament and administrative
offices in some central spot —on the coast,
perhaps, but preferably inland, since
coastal capitals tend to drain population
from the inland —collecting and spending
its own revenue in its own area and bend-
ing its energies to attract land-settlers,
artisans and capital from overcrowded
parts. But the impulse to this must come
from the North itself. It can go on send-
ing complaints of neglect and demands
for attention to Brisbane and Canberra
for the next 100 years and it will get
exactly nowhere —except, possibly, into
the hands of an alien race.

POLITICAL POINTS
There are no flies on Roy Morgan, who
conducts the Gallup polls. He correctly
predicted decisive “No” majorities in all
the States, with, relatively to total effective
votes, Queensland first, Tasmania second
and his own State, Victoria, sixth. It
required courage, as well as analytical
skill, to plump for substantial turnovers
in South Australia and Westralia, foi
these States gave Dr. Evatt his only
“Yes” majorities 196,294-191,317 in
S.A. and 140,399-128,303 in the West—
at the 1944 referendum. The Common-
wealth “No” vote was estimated at 62 p.c.,
and it looks as if the rather astonishing
young man will be very near the mark in
every case.
If the referendum vote is repeated at
the general election next year, as it may
be, there will be only the shadow of a
“Labor” party left. Taking adverse
majorities as a guide, with heaps more
“No” votes to come in, gone will be
Chifley (5000), Evatt (9000), Pollard
(6000), Dedman (3000), Riordan (3000),
Lemmon (5000), Barnard (6000), Scully
(5000) and Chambers (2000); and, among
the private members, Fraser (10,000),
Fuller (4000), Mulcahy (5000), Daly
(13.000) Haylen (15,000), Langtry (4000),
Williams (11,000), Falstein (6000),
Lazzarini (2000), McLeod (12,000),
Lawson (17,000), Conelan (22,000),
Edmonds (4000), Hadley (31,000 —yes,
31,000), Gaha (7000), Duthie (6000),
Sheehy (14,000), Russell (9000) and Burke
(15.000) “Poor old Holloway” would
doubtless become leader of the remnant,
and “poor old Holloway” couldn’t lead
a horse to a trough.
A bad quarter-hour is in store for
Holloway in addition to the bad quarter-
hours he and all the others experienced on
Saturday night. At the session beginning
today he will be called upon to explain
what control he had over Garden during
the four years when Garden, though part
of the Labor and National Service outfit
(Holloway) for four years, was accepted
as one of the staff of Transport and
External Territories (Ward), with the
privilege of throwing his weight about.
Hopes that there would be British
Commonwealth unity on at least one
issue, Palestine, were shattered by Smuts,
who, in the jargon of modern diplomats
and “diplomatic correspondents,” gave
“unilateral” recognition to Israel. There
are 100,000 Jews in the Union, and they
run a dozen publications and a Zionist
Federation with 500 or 600 “branches or
correspondents,” so the old P.M. was
just bidding for the Jewish vote. The
manoeuvre did him little good and lots
of harm.
Smuts’s recognition of Israel drew the
anticipated announcement from “authori-
tative circles” at Canberra before the
veteran—always “Slim Jannie” to the
veldt —lost his office and his seat:
The Commonwealth Government is likely
to grant provisional recognition for two
important reasons: (1) The Jewish State
controls an important coastal section of
Palestine, (2) Australia needs to recognise
an authoritative body to ensure protection
of Australian nationals [and presumably
the sanctity of Calwell-avenue, Tel Aviv],
McGirr is expected to weigh-in with
delaying “reasons,” four at least:
(1) The Kogarah by-election.
(2) Kogarah is in Dr. Evatt’s electorate
of Barton, and so is Hurstville, represented
by the doctor’s brother, who is McGirr’s
Assistant-Treasurer and Housing Minister.
(3) Rejecting the urgings of Chifley-Evatt
and McGirr-Evatt, Kogarah and Hurstville
voted cruelly against the prices-and-charges
racket, and the adverse majority in Barton,
nearing 9000 on Monday, may reach 10,000.
And there was, of course, the failure of
Abie Landa and Maxie Falstein to hold
Coogee for the Cause.
Queenslanders were astonished at
Hanlon’s advocacy of a “Yes” vote. They
wondered why the man had failed to
realise that it would infallibly mean a
Miners’ Federation ultimatum to Chifley
to “crucify” the Blair Athol venture, in-
deed any other attempt by Queensland to
develop its vast coal deposits and so free
itself from the Communist-bossed N.S.W.
coal tyranny whose production figures,
and the general consequences to transpoit
and industry, are worse than ever. The
people remembered what Hanlon forgot,
also remembering the criminal Com-
munist blockade of their State ; and their
answer from the Border to the Gulf was
a resounding “No.”
A disappointing animal known as
Shannon has had another race in
California his eighth. After his
solitary win a correspondent caught a
glimpse of “Australian Vice-Consul
Kenneth Pring holding a handful of tote
tickets,” and heard him say to American
reporters, "Now you can understand why
we Australians were so interested in this
horse.” What other Australians can’t
understand, especially after a bitter half-
hour with their income-tax assessments, is
why “Labor” is keeping a staff at San
Francisco and what it can possibly find
to do.
Dennett, the Victorian Minister of
Agriculture, supporting the case for lift-
ing State Ministers’ and members’ pay, as
presented to the judicial committee going
into the question, said some crisp things:
Members can claim up to £l5O of elec-
tion expenses as exemption from taxable
income. But a disclosure of actual expenses
might mean a rebate on the one hand and
a prosecution on the other.
As for defeated candidates, I am sure
some of them stand just to get tax
deductions.
Other people prefer making well-adver-
tised gifts to charity.
A skeleton, a gold tooth, a gold wristlet-
watch and “a rotted 12-bore shotgun”
have been identified as having belonged
to “a well-known bookmaker’s clerk.”
Getting a military call-up at Broken Hill
in 1942, he went out into the bush and
destroyed himself. Didn’t anyone tell the
fellow?-—but that doesn’t matter now.
Let the curtain fall on the hapless inno-
cent ; and a bookie’s clerk, too!
Is a State measure providing for prefer-
ence to ex-servicemen in the State public
service invalid to the extent that it is in-
consistent with the Federal Re-establish-
ment and Re-employment Act, which
also purports to give preference to ex-
servicemen? The question is being tested
before the High Court, the complainant
being a warder at Pentridge—he is not
an ex-serviceman, and for that reason was
not recommended for promotion. Strange
that two Parliaments could differ so in
enacting preference for soldiers! On
preference for unionists perfect unanimity
prevails.
Results of the 40-hour week and unpeg-
ging of wages show up in retail prices,
which have reached an all-time record.
Between April, 1947, and April, 1948,
weighted average for the six capital cities
rose from 1084 to 1207. Chifley, when
warned in advance of what would happen,
scoffed at it as a capitalist bogy.
Nothing is as full of sound and fury
as a N.S.W. “Labor” Minister tackling
a mere taxpayer or a spokesman for a
politically weak section. For example,
Finnan, lately translated into Minister for
Labor and Industry and father of a bill
to force deliveries of perishables. Find-
ing some shopkeepers “defiant,” Haddock
told them they’d come to heel or he’d
have their businesses “examined,” with
special attention to their trading licences.
This was just after Communist-inspired
gasworkers had refused to “deliver” gas,
and left housewives to battle with back-
yard fires in the teeth of freezing wester-
lies and rampaging ’flu germs, which
failure of “delivery” caused four known
deaths. Nobody was punished for that /
The N.S.W. Water Conservation and
Irrigation Commission is to permit the
Rice Marketing Board to allow the Rice
Equalisation Association to arrange for
the growing of rice “on a limited number
of holdings” in the Wakool district “for
the next four years.” But only men
“already equipped with rice-farming
plant” need apply. Anyone hoping to
buy a pound of rice as a result had better
stick to spaghetti.
According to the Commonwealth Hous-
ing Director in Queensland, 9316 houses
were built there last year and 38,034 in
Australia nearly 90,000 in Australia
since June 30, 1945. Ah, the “90,000
in three years” that McGirr promised
N. S. Wales! Identified at last.
The Victorian Chief Justice has held
that a wages-card signed as a receipt must
carry a State duty-stamp if the amount
exceeds £2. It cost an employee 555.
and what the appeal cost to find it out.
Natural accompaniment of the Com-
munist-caused coal shortage and strikes
and threats of more, the boom in air-
travel and air-freights goes on. Three
major airlines are transporting 80
to 100 p.c. more passengers than
a year ago, smaller lines still more;
and A.N.A. is carrying nearly twice as
much freight. It’s got State Premiers and
railway-union bosses horribly worried, the
former about their railway systems, and
the latter about their meal-tickets’ jobs.
Campaigning against the prices-and-
charges ramp, Fadden saw more of the
Commonwealth than any other speaker,
and his 13,000-miles travelling left him
too tired and worried to rejoice much at
the victory in which he had an honorable
share. Worried, because he came upon
evidence of declining production every-
where. And he knows that can’t go on
without Australia careering into serious
trouble, though paper money accumulates
till it reaches the sky.
The glut of Federal public servants in
Melbourne has led to a difficulty at the
old M.U.1.0.0.F. building in Swanston-
street. Priority tickets had to be issued
to T.-A.A. officials so that they might get
to their offices via the building’s two lifts
instead of being crowded out by the
swarm from Supply and Development.
Gilbert would have enjoyed the spectacle
of the bureaucratic ants jostling one an-
other to reach their rubber-stamps, and
would have delighted in versifying the
official instructions: “Delay due to ele-
vator congestion will be regarded on the
same plane as any other travel factor
associated with the journey from home to
office.”
“Labor” made a sorry showing on the
platform, as well as in the polling booth.
It was infatuated folly not to use the ’flu
epidemic as an excuse for scratching
Ward for all referendum engagements,
especially as he showed temper, vomited
threats of what he was going to do to
the press and reduced the McGirrs to
despair by beefing out demands for One
Big Parliament. Cries of “Timber!”
assailed him even on his own stamping-
ground, Darlinghurst. Here, however,
they were silenced in deafening Doric by
Senator Grant, whose shout of “Eddie
War-rd’s incorr-rruptible an’ ye know
it” could have been heard at Woolloo-
mooloo. The author of Through Six
Jails was in great voice.
The Secretary-General of U.N.O. has
sent his assistant to London with a mes-
sage expressing grave concern at the effect
indecision about Palestine will have “on
the usefulness of U.N.0.” Why to
London, when the British Government
has, vainly, warned U.N.O. all along that
its proposals for Palestine must have
force to back them up? And what is
the “usefulness of U.N.0.” anyway?
Calwell, blithering along in his usual
way: “We haven’t got the power under
the Constitution to socialise even a lolly-
shop.” And if they had they haven’t
got the ability to run one.
Chifley’s attitude to Communists is
that they are merely supporters of a
“philosophy” and must not as “workers”
(that is, Chifley supporters) be “cruci-
fied.” The Attlees decided on a purge.
Mild as it was, they struck “difficulties”
as soon as they brought the unions into
the discussion. For instance, if a civil
servant resigned from the Communist
party, what then? “Out he goes,” said
Attlee. “Then out must go your Food
Minister, Strachey,” replied the unions.
Deadlock ensued. Again, a dismissed
Commo demanded a formal trial, with
legal defence. The Government objected
that this would entail formal'prosecution
and it couldn’t allow secret-service evi-
dence to be called. Deadlock again.
Somebody must have been busy taking
soundings about Beasley and Makin get-
ting back into Parliament when (or if)
House numbers are increased. Anyhow,
Canberra announces that neither will try
a comeback because neither’s health will
stand it. Better to say that they won’t
return because the electors wouldn’t
stand it.
Melbourne “Age,” commenting on
“the revelation that the Commonwealth
Employment Service is costing £943,911
a year in wages, salaries and expenses for
1499 employees,” holds that “it will
arouse an emphatic demand for drastic
reduction.” The “Age” will be disap-
pointed. One of the most startling aspects
of this regulated community is the sheep-
like acceptance of inflictions. Nowhere
is this more evident than in the big cities.
Go to Martin-place, Sydney, any wet
evening and watch the sodden queues
waiting patiently for buses that either
arrive 30 minutes late or not at all. In
silence they stand ; in silence they take
their drenched bodies into the buses. In
silence they pay fares double what they
paid when the city had real transport
services—privately-owned, of course —
which ran to time.
One of those Sydney “columnists”
(“S. M. Herald”) was moved to reveal
that he had been reading “Russia and
Us,” issued by “the Australian Russian
Society,” which “seems to be doing a
better job for the Reds than their own
party publications”:
What should specially interest McGirr is
that his Housing Minister, Mr. Clive Evatt,
is President of the Society.
It should, especially as McGirr sent his
Housing Minister, who is also his
Assistant Treasurer, to welcome De
Valera to Sydney. Another “columnist”
(“Sun”) was inspired by a New York mes-
sage to ask a related question:
Who gave the vote on behalf of Aus-
tralia against a British resolution at the
Status of Women Commission which pro-
tested against the refusal of the U.S.S.R.
to allow Russian wives to join their British
husbands?
That would be Mrs. Jessie Street, the
twice-defeated “Labor” candidate for
Wentworth, and of Sheepskin s-for-
Russia celebrity. Mrs. Street is “Senior
Vice-President” of “the Society.”
Always ready for a crack at Chamber-
lain, Sydney “D.T.” discovered that
“for years before World War II the
democratic” (i.e., flapper) “press and its
foreign correspondents were almost alone
in warning the world of Hitler’s and
Mussolini’s preparations for war, of the
danger of the Munich policy,” but
“Chamberlain’s guilty men” ignored them.
Since less than a twelvemonth elapsed
between the signing of the Munich agree-
ment and the outbreak of war the strip-
tease press couldn’t have been at that
particular “warning” for years. And
at Munich Chamberlain did at least
save us from being dragged into a crazy
war for dear old Czechoslovakia—a war
of which the flapper press approved.
Rumors of a change in the color of
the note issue are about again. Advo-
cates say it would catch blackmarketeers.
It might, but wouldn’t it be rather unfair
to politicians who might want to pay
accounts in notes kept at their offices for
punting or for purchase of a car.

“Craiser”: There are various ways in
which legends are built up around virtuosi,
and every entrepreneur knows how valu-
able they are. When Pavlova arrived in
Melbourne it was announced that she
would observe the tradition of her
Russian birthplace by allowing herself to
be carried over the threshold of His
Majesty’s by the first man who greeted
her at the theatre. One of the Taits
gallantly performed the office; but, if
the truth be known, the old Russian cus-
tom was the bright invention of a press-
man who was down on the wharf at her
arrival. Pianist Eileen Joyce, making a
triumphant tour of her native Tasmania,
was reported as saying she didn’t know
how old she was and was going to search
for her birth-certificate when she visited
her birthplace, Zeehan. All she could
remember was that she had been cradled
in half a kerosene-case—an ancient cus-
tom on Tasmania’s west coast. Actually,
Miss Joyce happens to be one of the
few distinguished women who have sup-
plied the date of their birth to the editors
of Who’s Who in Australia. It is given
as November 21, 1912.

“Findy”: These yoomanitarians!
Federal Minister Ward told a Sydney
Domain audience that he was “appalled”
to find that New Guinea natives killed in
an air-crash had been treated as freight
and paid for at so much a pound. He
had stopped the practice. I should have
thought the essential point would have
been to find out if the plane was over-
loaded ; whether the passengers were paid
for at so much a nob or so much a pound
seems irrelevant. I weigh more than
“Dear me. I'm afraid your intended Won't be here —a Miss Lizard
grabbed him!”
most New Guinea natives, yet when I
travel by air I always feel it a little unfair
that I, with my meagre 10 stone, am
allowed only the same amount of luggage
as a 16-stoner, although we are both
charged the same fare. The Australian
airline that decides to introduce the
poundage basis for air travel will get my
support every time. So, incidentally, will
the tailor who institutes a sliding-scale
for making suits; on the present flat-rate
basis the small bloke helps to pay for the
acres of material it takes to cover the
o.s. customer.

“C.Q.”: If Lord Tennyson had been so
indignant as to mutter “Damned imperti-
nence ! ” over Bradman’s allegedly sending
a message that he was too busy to see
him at Lord’s, the grandson of the poet
must be more easily insulted than his
father was. I unwittingly insulted the old
boy on an occasion. He was to present
me with a medal for, among other things,
my alleged knowledge of his father’s
poems, revealed in a State-wide exami-
nation. In a state of acute perspiration
I mounted the dais and was introduced to
his awe-inspiring person by the voluble
chancellor of the university where the
function took place. My awe of the
second Tennyson was almost as great as
if it had been Alfred himself, and in my
perturbation I shook hands with the
chancellor first. This grave breach of
savoir jaire or amour propre or some-
thing didn't perturb his Lordship in the
slightest. He patted me on my well-
oiled head and said he was pleased to
know I was interested in his dad’s poetry.

“Dong”; Struck by what seemed a
simple recipe for “little cakes” on a
packet of flour, I looked to see if the
wife was out of sight and reached for an
egg-beater. They were remarkably palat-
able, and the little lady had never had
such a pleasant surprise, and now that
I’ve had six months’ Sunday-afternoon
practice she has classed them as “culinary
epics,” with the understanding that she
shall enjoy the sinkers as long as she
doesn’t give away my secret. Last week-
end I had just finished baking and had
to make a quick exit from the kitchen,
tell my wife some friends were coming
up the path, and assume a preoccupied
air looking for ticks on the dog. Later,
as the visitors acclaimed the cakes, my
wife’s guard dropped for a second and
she absentmindedly announced: “Yes,
Dong made them.” She gave a horrified
gasp, realising that the layer of golden
eggs would henceforth be broody. The
male visitor saved the situation: “Is that
so? My specialties are Ningadoos. Use
a gem-iron for them, oven 450. But have
you ever tried lamingtons?” And there,
for some unaccountable reason, the
womenfolk commenced hooting with
laughter.

“R. Volt”: What finished off that first
Atlantic cable which helped to provide
a handle to “Jem’s” paperknife (B.
26/5/’4B) was an electrical miscalcula-
tion. Engineers had had no experience
of long cables and thought a high voltage
was necessary to push the juice across
the Atlantic. A few days after Queen
Victoria had exchanged greetings with the
then President of the United States the
thin copper line became mysteriously
silent. Its insulation had broken down
under the stress of the electric current,
and a million-pounds’-worth of copper,
iron and gutta-percha lay inert on the
ocean’s bottom. Electricians have since
learnt to use currents so small that they
are measured in terms of decimal points
of milliamperes. Consequently instru-
ments have had to become so sensitive
that a fresh problem has arisen from
the disturbances likely to be incurred
from earth currents, auroras, tram power-
houses and even metal objects like
watches carried on the person. This has
again been solved by a multitude of
screening devices. I was once in charge
of a station where the hairlike spring of
metal which conveyed motion from a
vibrator to the needle-like glass siphon
which spurted ink on to the moving tape
of the recording instrument was subject
to the slightest temperature changes. I
noticed the phone girl had a ruddy mop
of hair with a curl that never varied, and
I invited her to sacrifice a thread of it
in the interests of science. Made into a
spiral it worked like a charm, and the
temperature trouble vanished. For a long
“ They're two Canberra civil servants on different salary grades!”
time I thought only red-headed girls
could perform the office, but it turned
out that blondes and brunettes were
equally effective.

“Bo”: The imprimatur of ladyship was
once based on reactions immediately fol-
lowing a careless waiter’s tipping of a
plate of mulligatawny over a newly-done
perm. But there is a severer test. Frail
human that I am, my glance was arrested
by the brace of striking blondes standing
talking on a city corner. They were
dressed smartly, but nothing overdone ;
they looked sophisticated, but not bold.
They parted ; one, essaying to cross the
street, stepped out in front of a parked
truck. She paused, looked back and
added a reminder of some future en-
gagement to her friend. The friend
glanced at something behind the truck,
looked at the blonde standing on the
road, pointed to her stockings and
shrieked something. The blonde on the
road glanced down in panic, thinking her
nylons had laddered. Then the muni-
cipal water-truck surged past. As the
wave of propelled water swept gutterward
it completely submerged the blonde’s
platform-soled suede shoes ; she made a
wild leap for the pavement, but suc-
ceeded only in landing in the miniature
river which carried debris to a high-
water-mark around her hocks. I was
generously prepared to allow even a lady
a mild “damn.” The blonde took one
glance at her ruined trilbies, then at
the water-truck sailing unconcernedly on
its way, and in a voice like a tenon-saw
going through tin she spat out: “The
bloody swine—he did that on purpose!”

“Martin Haley”; Beatrice Grimshaw’s
mention of “Innisfree” (B. 21/4/’4B)
recalls the fact that, when Yeats first
wrote this poem in 1886 or 1887, it con-
sisted of two verses only. The second
verse was much the same in the better-
known version, but the first was very dif-
ferent. A comparison between the
original verse and its present form is a
tremendous lesson in craftsmanship.
Originally it ran:
I will arise and go now and go to the island
of Innisfree,
And live in a dwelling of wattles, of woven
wattles and woodwork made.
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a yellow hive
for the honey-bee,
And this old care shall fade.
That verse is nothing above the ordi-
nary ; what replaced it has the magic of
fine lyricism.

“C.A.G.”: In 1942 our unit went from
Gunnedah to Melville (W.A.), where it
staged whilst awaiting news of its ulti-
mate destination. Hopes for the Middle
East ran high. After a month of specu-
lation came a phone-call from Perth L. of
C. notifying receipt of urgent code mes-
sage from Barracks, Sydney, which had
to be collected personally. In the
absence of the C.O. the Security Officer
ordered the staff car, glamorised himself,
and for company took the also glamor-
ised Padre. With sparkling eyes the S.O.
prophesied to his companion; “This is
it! ” Arriving at a palatial Mount Lavflley
home where Sigs were roughing it the S.O.
received the cryptic message, and rushed
with all speed to another posh dump to
have it decoded. Shortly afterwards he
emerged, leapt into the car, and ordered
a speedy return to camp. The very
curious Padre tactfully refrained from
questions, but as they re-entered Melville
Camp the S.O.’s language showed little
respect for the cloth. The Padre made
allowances when he read the message;
“Notify immediately whereabouts twenty-
three latrine pans missing Gunnedah after
your departure.”

“Uco”: Anomalies in book prices (B.
26/5/’48)? In a Sydney bookshop I
found on the bargain counter a volume
of verse by an Australian poet of a previ-
ous generation. Well-bound and in good
condition, it was one of a limited edition
and bore the author’s autograph on the
flyleaf. Price one shilling. I carried it
off in triumph, and later in the day men-
tioned it casually to a collector of Aus-
tralian. “Autographed by Fizgig?” he
asked. “Yes,” I replied, “and a few
words of best wishes and the date.” “Bad
luck,” said the collector. “The real prize
to look out for is a copy of Fizgig’s works
without an autograph. The blighter
signed the whole bang lot.”

“J.K.”: Adam Lindsay Gordon a
minor poet (B. 5/5/’48)? In the Gordon
Memorial Cottage at Ballarat hangs a
letter from Teddy Roosevelt stating that
he and his family had long been admirers
of Gordon’s verse. A poet who has had
nearly 50 editions of his work published
in Australia, England and America can
hardly be classed as a minor poet.
Gordon has several memorials in England,
two memorial cottages, Ballarat and
Dingley Dell, two statues, a bust, a
plaque, a memorial-stone at Mt. Gambler
and thousands of memorial trees grown
from seed from the tree over his grave
at Brighton (Vic.), “Uco” might tell us
how many minor poets have a bust in
the Abbey.

“Nakh”: The confidence-man’s tech-
nique doesn’t vary much. A Hindu
farmer, after 17 years of hard work as a
Mallee farmer, sold his farm for £1470
and came to Melbourne to buy a ticket
to his homeland. While walking down
the street with a friendly hotel acquaint-
ance he picked up a wallet with £5O in it.
He had no sooner picked it up than a
second man came up and claimed it.'* This
chap was as friendly as the first and
offered to form a syndicate and put the
£5O on a neddy. The syndicate duly won
£l5O on their first wager, and the co-
religionist of Gandhi was even more de-
lighted when, a few days later, the com-
pany had won a cool £6OOO. The book-
maker, however, wouldn’t let them see
the color of their money until he had
seen the £2OOO that had been allegedly
wagered, so the Hindu handed over the
whole of his savings. The money had a
miraculous effect —his partners promptly
vanished.

“Plop”: In the tram I found myself
opposite my old French teacher, still
toting the derelict Le Roi des Montagues
she used to shake at us —probably just
from sentiment, for by now she could no
doubt quote it backwards. I thought, as
I watched her, of the old days. She was
the one who, in the course of a year,
was alleged to have eloped in turn with
five of our male teachers, old Stinks alone
remaining wedded to his work. More
memorably, she was the one who had
made me write out “Rosbif (m), roast-
beef” 200 times. But, looking back, I
realised that of all my teachers she had
done something for me, for I could go
into a French restaurant and yell for
roast sirloin. She looked up, recognised
me, beamed and then let fly, in unadul-
terated French, with what I took to be a
greeting, as amazing to me as to my
fellow-passengers. At last she and the
vehicle paused, and uttering a hopeless
“bonjewer” I shot out through the door
with my tail down like a chien’s.
DRY ARGUMENT.
“Referring to a notice in Brisbane City Hall
asking people not to take lemonade bottles upstairs
and throw them at the speaker, Mr. Menzies said
‘I regard that as the last exquisite touch of cour-
tesy.’ — : News item.
When to the sessions of persuasive speech
Orating chaps attend the City Hall,
They ask no suave-voiced chairman to beseech
A fair and open go from one and all,
For, see, the poster that’s a master-stroke:
“No bottle-shying at the verbose bloke.”
1 can recall a meeting once in Warwick
Where Billy copped a ripe egg in the eye
And spake some oaths in manner truly Doric
To him who acted so offensively;
But nothing of the sort, you understand,
Occurs today in fair Bananaland.
And do I not remember R. G. Menzies
Was scrap-ironed once in Ward-ruled Darling-
hurst
When hecklers, moved to vent their several
frenzies,
Howled like hyenas evermore accurst?
That sort of thing no one would ever dare
To emulate in Brisbane’s King George Square.
Ah, no! When politicians ope their throttles,
Addressing crowds in Hanlon’s sun-kissed
town,
They fear not eggs, nor cabbages, nor bottles,
Nor Reds, nor jeers, nor disapproving frown,
No thud of hammer or the swish of sickle,
Since Hanlon put the Comrades into pickle.

MASTERS OF TIME
“Lord Luvus”; I see that Mr. Calwell
has been at it again. Haydn James,
chorus-master of the J.C.W. Italian opera
and a fine musician, recently discovered a
lovely voice in Apalonia Sapalis, a 31-
year-old Latvian singer brought to Aus-
tralia as a “displaced person” and now
working in the kitchen at the Heidelberg
(Vic.) Military Hospital. “It is a great
pity,” he said, “to leave her hiding, in a
kitchen.” Thus Mr. Calwell: “Australia
has a right to expect that these people —
no matter what their skill or attributes —
will give their services for a period of up
to two years in some branch of the Aus-
tralian economy in which labor is scarce.”
He forbade Apalonia to leave her job
to launch on a career as an operatic
singer. Mr. James’s remark he stig-
matised as an “impertinent observation,”
and darkly added, “Even at this stage
I could change my mind about allowing
J. C. Williamson to bring an Italian opera
company ,to Australia.” If Mr. Calwell
is Australia speaking in the first state-
ment, is he also Australia speaking when
he voices a mean threat against a
theatrical company? It might be asked
whether Miss Sapalis would be serving
Australia’s economy better by washing-up
dishes than giving it beauty with a voice
claimed by an expert to be good. It
was a greater authority than Mr. Calwell
who said that man may not live by bread
alone.

“Thistlebank”; Just heard two reasons
advanced, both unofficial, to account for
the shortage of nurses in at least one big
Melbourne hospital. Situated on the out-
skirts of the metropolis, it houses chronic
cases chiefly. The reasons given are that
the hospital is “too far out,” and that
few, if any, student medicos attend. Some
of the big country hospitals experiencing
similar trouble attribute their difficul-
ties to the same causes, with emphasis
on the lastnamed. It’s said that big city
hospitals, nearer the bright lights and
with large and regular attendances of
young male medicos, are seldom short
of staff.

“Ron J.”; When a Melbourne account-
ant lost his umbrella on his way to work
he blamed everybody but himself. Bus-
men, railwaymen and fellow-travellers
were, generally speaking, all rogues,
thieves and liars. His mood suddenly
changed when his wife rang to say that
the umbrella had been picked up in the
train by a Mr. Jones who worked in a
city emporium. The accountant spent
two hours roaming over a seven-story
store for the purpose of interviewing 12
Mr. Joneses on the staff. None of them
knew anything of the umbrella or the
message. He ranted worse than ever,
but by way of contrast there was a re-
freshing chuckle from a trio of his work-
mates who, in a spirit of mischief and
revenge, started the hoax by telephoning
the accountant’s wife.
“Lance Quad”: Once more the foul
canard has been published, this time by
cartoon (B- 26/5/’4B), that ladies of
embonpoint are apt to trample their
dancing partners to death. The theory
that a heavy woman must necessarily be
a heavy dancer is as false" as any theory
can be, for when a plump woman dances
she is generally astonishingly light on her
own feet and never dances upon her
partner’s. Next time that artist goes to
a dance let him consider the build of the
wallflowers thereat.

“Clooter”: The sight of Merino rams
in Martin-place somewhat astonished
those Sydney citizens who happened to
sight them this week —a living sheep
being to Sydney citizens almost as strange
a phenomenon as a fresh egg or a strike-
less week —and, always ready to attend a
show of any kind, many made it their
business to inspect these peculiar animals.
They appeared as a sort of curtain-
raiser to what the city could have re-
garded as a national “wool week” ; wool-
selling auctions opened in Sydney on
Monday, a sheep show began on Tuesday,
accompanied by sheepdog trials; stud-
sheep sales will follow next week. This
was accompanied by the usual radio and
press articles, and sundry persons —includ-
ing me—discovered themselves possessed
of ideas about wool and sheep and wrote
“ It's just a touch of frostbite."
te their favorite editor about it. All of
which would be good if it wasn’t so
transitory. Presently the show and wool-
and sheep-sales will be over, the kelpies
and Border Collies will vanish and the
only sheep left in Martin-place will be
the human ones being dumbly drafted
into the conveyances provided for them
by a more-op-less benevolent State. For
the most part their only concern about
sheep will he the price of lamb-chops, and
that’s enough to rttake the mildest house
wife in the city swear. But it proves
how divorced from the land Australia’s
biggest city is when the spectacle of a
few sheep can excite almost as much in-
terest as would the apparition of an
empty house.
* * * *
“Iron Baron”: One of the things that
have puzzled visitors to Whyalla, South
Australia’s shipbuilding centre, is the
empty half-acre or so fair in the heart
of the place apparently reserved for no
other purpose than to graze five or six
kangaroos. All round it are the new,
modern buildings, and thousands pass it
every day. The ’roos, blase animals who
would probably be scared to death if
turned out in the saltbush, bask in the
sun or disdainfully accept chocolate or
biscuit from passers-by. They’re to be
disturbed, the Town Commission intend-
ing to buy the block and build thereon
a Civic Centre —picture theatre, two
lesser halls, shops, offices, municipal
chambers, women’s rest-room —to cost
about £65,000, and revenue from which
will be used to provide the town with
other amenities. I suppose it’s all in aid
of progress, but I can’t help thinking that,
since Whyalla now has adequate water —
brought by pipeline from the Murray 230
miles away—it would have made a bonny
little park and resting-place for both the
townsfolk and travellers awaiting the
buses to Whyalla’s suburbs and Port
Augusta railhead.

“Zake”; Dwellers in Sydney’s outer
suburbs who observe an anxious-looking
fellow going around collecting all the
butter-boxes he can lay hands on will be
wrong in assuming he is a blackmarket
operator in them —he’s only the owner of
a milk run, who reckons each box worth
quarter of a minute to him. Sounds
idiotic, but it isn’t. The Milkos’ Union,
run on lines to delight the Commos, has
been conducting a blitz against vendors
who finish their run late, it being, under
the Milk Board regime, an offence for the
milk-cart to be on the streets beyond a
certain hour. Our milk-vendor stopped
a £l2 fine when one of his milkos to
whom he has to cough up £2 p.w. over
the award wage to stop him going else-
where finished his run quarter of an
hour or so late. So, to save the milko
going right round the back of the house
to the servery, he has been humbly peti-
tioning his customers for permission to
nail a butterbox somewhere on the side
fence, inconspicuous yet handy to the
front gate. If he saves 15 seconds on
each house his total on 200 is close to
an hour, and then he can laugh at the
inspectors.

“Flathead”; My hypo curdled when I
read “F.S.’s” statement (B. 19/5/’4B) that
Helen Keller started when a press-
photographer fired his flashlight some
distance away because her “tactile sense
is so amazingly developed that she felt the
heat of the combustion.” I admit that
the flash-bulb has heat —it prompted that
old gag among press-photographers of
unscrewing their bulb with a handkerchief
and then giving it to someone to hold —
but assuming that “F.S.’s” enigmatic
“some distance” is at least 10ft., then
the heat emitted by the bulb would
approximate that of Barrenjoey light-
house as felt on Norfolk Island. A more
feasible explanation may be that at the
time of the flash, folk standing very close
to Miss Keller, her guide, for instance,
gave the usual slight jump, and naturally
she sensed that and responded.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”; Astonishment of Parisians
that an Empire issue had been raised by
the attendance by invitation of a British
royal couple at a race-meeting and a
night-club on the Sabbath is not sur-
prising. One of the charming spectacles
of the art cosmopolis is Sunday morning.
Tens of thousands of damsels and
their boy-friends, baskets loaded with
comestibles and wine, start off for
Fontainebleau, Versailles or one of the
numerous woods made famous by genera-
tions of artists. A proportion much
larger than the congregations that file
into Melbourne’s churches duck into the
Notre Dame or one or other of the
numerous churches, dip their fingers into
the holy font, make a genuflection, take
a pew for 20 minutes’ worship and then
go out to catch train, tram or ferry and
spend the rest of the day in recreation.
They have been doing that for centuries,
and the Sabbatarian outburst from Scot-
land must have caused them innocent
amazement. It just shows how little
countries living cheek-by-jowl with one
another and served with radio, films,
newspapers and all the latest forms of
modern communication really know
about each other.

“S.S.”: Our army was equipped for
all emergencies. We received an urgent
call that a woman was having a baby a
bit before its time. It was a desolate
spot, and the rain had been spilling con-
tinuously for a week. The river was
swollen and a car could not cross at the
normal fording places. We took a Field
Ambulance and an amphibious jeep. The
ambulance was halted at the river; we
got the jeep across, negotiated a rough
track, collected the woman and an agi-
tated husband, made a successful re-
crossing of the river, transferred the
woman and her husband into the Field
Ambulance and delivered her at the hos-
pital about five minutes ahead of
schedule. ‘‘Operation Midwife” we
called it.

“Muskeen”: Some of those early
Romans (B. 19/5/’4B) maintained pools
stocked with voracious moray eels, and
offending concubines thrown therein were
gone in seconds. Whenever an old Sena-
torial bird pondered sentimentally over
some departed wench he would order an
eel-pie, which, in the circumstances, was
an even choicer bit than a nightingale’s-
tongue pasty.

“Macnell”: One hundred and eighty-
three years ago Nelson’s Victory was
launched at Old Single Dock, Chatham.
Last month Admiral Sir Algernon Willis
relievQd Admiral Lord Fraser as C.-in-C.
Portsmouth, and hoisted his flag in
Victory, which, since 1889, has been
flagship of the station. A summary
of the stout old ship’s story is a
recital of English history. First job
was flagship of Admiral Keppel; there
followed a succession of famous names
—Kempenfelt, Howe, Hood, Jervis and,
in 1797, the battle of C. St. Vincent.
After being nearly wrecked in Lagos Bay,
she helped to blockade Cadiz and was
shortly afterwards paid off and her name
struck off the Navy List. For two years
Victory was a convict hulk, until, after
a thorough reconditioning in 1803, she
was commissioned as Nelson’s flagship.
After Trafalgar she refitted and assisted
at a Dunkirk operation—the evacuation
of Moore’s troops from Corunna. In 1812
she finally paid off at Portsmouth, where
she’s been since. In 1903 the old ship
was rammed port side amidships when
battleship Neptune parted her tow, per-
haps in a fit of spite at going to the ship-
breakers. Neptune’s ram pierced the hull
at the exact spot where Nelson died in
the cockpit, displacing the oaken knee
that, as shown in the famous picture, sup-
ported the dying Admiral. In 1941 a
Nazi bomb blew an 18ft. hole under her
port bow. Next year naval preparations
for the Normandy landing were planned
aboard, and on VJ. Day in 1945 the old
battler was floodlit for the first time. In
January, 1946, the personal standard of
Princess Elizabeth was broken at the main
when she lunched on board with the
C.-in-C. and senior officers of Portsmouth
Command.- The 24 guests sat at a table
in Nelson’s dining-cabin.
THE NEW WEAPON.
“Nagging is one of the most effective weapons
women possess. Properly applied in unison, naming
could surely be as powerful for us as striking
apparently is for men.” —Sydney paper.
In olden days when menf olk’s merest wishes
Were law, a woman’s meek suggestion might
Still carty weight if she with tasty dishes
Could satisfy her master’s appetite.
Ere long the fatal power of their beauty
'Was realised by shrewd patrician vamps
And subtly used to turn men from their duty
Or make bold heroes puppets in their camps.
Then in the golden age of chivalry,
Milady on her pedestal with glances
Aroused her swains to knightly rivalry
When for her sake in jousts they levelled
lances.
Today, in undertaking most men’s jobs,
Our mastery she openly derides
And us of our ascendancy she robs
As off to work she walks in swinging strides.
And yet while we could muster up dyspeptics
Whose hearts could not be won with tasty
food,
And number in our ranks some bitter sceptics,
Immune to love, our chance to rule was good.
But now, alas! the boldest may turn pale
For once our women drop their wiles to nag
Not all our strength and science will prevail—
In next to no time we’ll be in the bag.

Palestine.
“Ek Dum”: The battle for
Palestine continued along con-
ventional lines during the week,
even to the futile political moves.
These, even if they succeed,
only carry the seeds of further
and more widespread trouble.
During the week the Russians
hastened to establish a “mission”
in Tel Aviv as the result of
their recognition of the Jewish
State of Israel, which now holds
about 600,000-700,000 people in
an area equal to a medium-sized
Northern Territory station, virtu-
ally all of them immigrant. They
represent an accession to a popu-
tion equal to that of Queens-
land and Tasmania put together,
already established on 10,000
square miles, including much
desert, when the Jews be-
gan to come. The Russian mis-
sion is not there for nothing.
It will provide a means of im-
porting large quantities of
materials covered by diplomatic
privilege because, in the present
state of affairs, the mission will
have to be defended and the
Jews certainly will not raise any
objection.
South Africa also recognised
Israel, and this no doubt had its
effect at the Union’s election, for,
although there are' a leaven of
fine loyal Jews in that country,
there is more than a sneak-
ing hatred of their race among
the Dutch and many British
owing to the fact that many of
the foreign “Jew” immigrants
who came in in 1920-22 were
unmasked in the 1922 rebellion
as Russian agents —bloodthirsty
wretches who in many ca'ses
were not Jews at all and who
came specifically to foment in-
surrection and set the black
races against the white.
Dr. Evatt’s Silence
The Australian Government,
as on most embarrassing mat-
ters, has been silent and in-
active, pending, presumably, the
holding of the prices referendum.
But the subject did not go un-
illuminated, for there arrived
fresh from the press during the
week a copy of Dr, Evatt’s new
book of lectures on the United
Nations. In the preface to, this
work, dated March, 1948, the
Doctor relates that, as the result
of a “general resurgence of
hope” and the “quickening of
the whole tempo of proceedings”
in the U.N.O. committees, “the
plan for the government of
Palestine, with separate Jewish
and Arab States, an overall
economic union and special
United Nations trust system for
Jerusalem and Bethlehem, was
adopted after a thorough in-
vestigation of all the relevant
facts and circumstances.” He
says that “this was further evi-
dence that the Assembly was
willing and capable of dealing
with one of the most difficult
and urgent problems affecting
international relations.”
Dr. Evatt rejoices at the
work of U.N.O. led by himself
in regard to Palestine, which was
evolved as the result of the
appointment on October 21 last
year of a commission, by 40
votes to six, with 11 abstentions,
to observe and report develop-
ments. This committee consisted
of Australia, Brazil, China,
France, Mexico, Netherlands,
Pakistan, Poland, U.S.S.R.,
United Kingdom and United
States. The U.S.S.R. and Poland
refused to act. At present most
members of this body are ob-
serving each other rather than
the Palestinian operations, and
at that with anger and dissension.
Among them, perhaps, Aus-
tralia (i.e., Dr. Evatt) is the only
one who could be got to agree
that such proceedings “establish
that the Assembly has more than
lived up to the expectations of
those who endowed it with addi-
tional powers, and has in a criti-
cal period sustained the hopes
of mankind in the future of the
United Nations.”
Impartial observers of that
congeries of moneywasting and
quarrelsome bureau cra t s
Ministers have ceased apparently
to attend most of its perform-
ances—are more inclined than
otherwise to believe that the
peace of the world would be
greatly served if the whole ex-
pensive excrescence were blotted
out of existence. All the pur-
pose it at present serves is as a
stadium for political intriguers
in which those who want to can
get at each other’s throats.
The Arab Viewpoint
There can be no agreement in
Palestine except through force
majeure or the submission of
one racial side to the other. And,
as the Arabs form two-thirds of
the population and have been
providing nearly all the natural
increase through births, it is un-
likely that they will or can give
in. Furthermore, they undoub-
tedly have a moral claim to the
country, since the Jews have been
out of possession of its govern-
ment since a.d. 135 or there-
abouts. At least five-sixths of
the Jewish immigrants have no
drop of Palestinian or Asiatic
blood in their veins for 10 gene-
rations back, and the policy of
the United Nations is in flat con-
tradiction to its anti-colonising
platform, upon which Russia and
Australia in particular profess to
be uncompromising.
Arab opinion, too, has har-
dened.
The Arab Note which was read
to the Security Council on May
27 by Dr. Naji Al-Asil, the
Iraqian representative, sets out
the viewpoint that the Jews, in
establishing the State of Israel,
deliberately flouted the peace
resolution of the Council which
was accepted on April 17. It
accused the Jews of ignoring
the truce and attacking and con-
solidating themselves in Jeru-
salem, leaving the Arabs no
alternative save to take co-ordi-
nated action to preserve the in-
terests of Palestine Arabs, includ-
ing those of 250,000 displaced
Arabs, and to restore peace and
order.
The Note added that if the
Arabs had been convinced that
last week’s cease-fire order would
not lead to other attacks the
situation would have been dif-
ferent. But they obviously lack
confidence in the ability of the
U.N.O. authorities to make the

cease-fire effective, and raise the
following questions:- —
Is the cease-fire order likely to
reduce the flow of Jewish immigrants?
Will it stop the importation of arms
for the Jews? Will it stop terrorist
violence and assure the safety of the
Arab population.
Faced with this and an accusa-
tion by the Israelian delegate
that the Note constituted a flat
and defiant rejection of U.N.O.’s
pleas, the Security Council took
its usual step in such cases —it
adjourned.
Meanwhile American papers,
nearly all Jewish-controlled or
strongly influenced by Jews, de-
mand the lifting of the arms em-
bargo, and poor old Britain,
cursed with its Attlee Socialist
Government, which is nearly as
ineffective in crisis as U.N.O.
and Canberra, is receiving a
drubbing for carrying out an
agreement to support the Arabs,
without which the Arabs would
long ago have been under the
thumb of Russia and leagued
against the United States and its
vital oil interests.
The British Government has
made it clear that it would obey
U.N.O. decisions in the matter,
but it was not ready to obey
them till a decision had been
made specifically.
Cease-fire Ordered
A development at the week-
end was the issue by the
Security Council of another
cease-fire order for a month.
This time it was linked with a
four-weeks arms embargo ap-
plied to both sides. This order
was brought forward as the re-
sult of a resolution moved by
Great Britain which provides,
also, that if either side violates
the order the imposition of
sanctions will be considered. The
order calls for assent by both
combatants by 9 a.m. today.
The scheme is likely to prove
ineffective, although it was based
on agreement between the British
and U.S. Governments. This is
shown by the moving by Russia
of an abortive motion to dis-
cipline the Arabs, proclaiming
them the implementers of a
threat to peace and calling for
sanctions against them only.
It is, as usual, certain that
Russia will go its own sweet
way, and if it feels inclined to
build up Israelite strength dur-
ing the Sabbatical month it will
do so. Every possible move will
be made to turn Palestine into a
Russian puppet State.
The Military Side
On the military side the de-
velopments were mainly strate-
gical. The Jewish coastal State
has been hardened into a nut
which has either exuded or mas-
ticated all its internal Arab re-
sistance. The Arabs had be-
gun to converge on this central
kernel from all directions.
Though in some cases they are
almost or actually within sight
of main objectives, including Tel
Aviv, the main fight was still in
front of them.
Both sides are fighting the
normal types of campaign in
such circumstances, applying
Clausewitzian principles. The
method of the Jews is the
approved one of keeping a hard
core to their defence while
choosing one of the enemy points
of pressure and trying to break
it down. This has the advan-
tage that it does not disperse
strength, all sections but the
main point of offensive resistance
being defended as passively as
possible. The Arabs, on the
other hand, have the advantage
of much larger forces, several
routes, a lateral railway running
within easy distance of. even
their most distant potential front
and feeding into it along the
whole width of their advance.
This gives them a fine mobility
in supply-lines—when their sup-
plies come within reasonable
distance of fighting areas.
The Jewish policy does not
look like one of their own de-
vising. Their national forte has
always been defence to the last
gasp in fortress areas, and it will
be surprising if the final phase
is not decided on a siege basis.
So far in generalship—despite
the opposite impression created
by press reports —the Jews ap-
pear to have come off best. The
Arabs have been delayed by the
necessity of conquering Jeru-
salem and cleaning up their lines
of communication. But the Jews
have chosen as their main point
of offensive-defence the supply
road to that city from Tel Aviv.
On that road a bitter struggle
was in progress at the week-end
—one which might be deter-
minative of the whole war .if it
establishes the moral ascendancy
of one side or the other. The
Arabs still had to take New
Jerusalem, though the old city
and its small force had surren-
dered.
Arabs’ Defence Policy
So far in their operations the
Arabs have shown themselves
somewhat careless of manpower
and ammunition, and diffuse in
their operational adventures, at
a period when they had no
more immediate major objectives
than to reduce a very lightly-held
isolated fortress and carry on
what was tantamount to a de-
fence of their end of the supply
line from the coast to the Holy
City.
The spirit of the general run
of the Arab people is shown by
the , correspondents’ messages
suggesting that in the Arab parts
of Palestine mostly within
sound of the guns or sight
of marching troops “life is
back to normal.” Villagers
crowd the bazaars, while in the
fields the harvest is being col-
lected as if the war were 1000
miles away.
The Jews, if they can maintain
and increase supplies, and more
especially if they can benefit in
time by the mysterious loan
which President Truman is
said to have promised Dr. Chaim
Weiszmann, have at present the
thick end of the stick. The Arab
Powers are scarcely in a position
to establish an effective block-
ade of Palestine ports. And Arab
lines of communications, despite
the local advantages of the
lateral railway, are long and
difficult, especially in the summer,
which is now on. In Bagdad
and Aleppo this month tempera-
tures of 110 in the shade are
quite normal.

What a South African Parliament with-
out Jan Christiaan Smuts will be like
can only be realised by imagining a
Federal Parliament without Billy Hughes.
Neither phenomenon has ever occurred
before. Smuts was elected to the first
Union Parliament in 1910 and became
Minister of Defence, Interior and Mines.
That gives him a record of 38 years,
all but nine of them spent on the Gov-
ernment side of the House and including
14 years as Prime Minister. A bitter
opponent of the British during the South
African war —he was commander of the
Boer forces in Cape Colony—he became
on the establishment of the Union a
staunch advocate of the Imperial tie.
With Botha, he suppressed the De Wet
rebellion in 1914, went on to conquer
German South-West Africa and led his
country’s forces in East Africa until he
was appointed to the Imperial War Cab-
inet in 1917, When Botha died in 1919
Smuts became Prime Minister, went into
Opposition five years later when Hert-
zog’s Nationalists came to power, but
joined in a Coalition Government as
Minister for Justice in the depression
years. In a life filled with big moments
Smuts’s really Big Moment came at the
outbreak of the Second World War. Hert-
zog stood for a policy of neutrality;
Smuts, advocating an immediate dec-
laration of war against Germany, car-
ried a no-confidence motion against his
leader, became Prime Minister for the
second time, and pledged South Africa
to the Allied s cause. Recently Smuts
has been advocating closer co-operation
between the British Dominions; his per-
sonal defeat and that of his party last
week came at a time when his prestige
outside his own country was as high
as ever. At 78, it seems unlikely that he
will attempt a comeback.
C. H. Peters, who has resigned from the
managing - directorship of Robertson
and Mullens in Melbourne partly for
health reasons and partly to write books
himself, has helped authors to launch their
brain-children for close on 50 years. His
first book will be one of reminiscence,
and it ought to be good. Since he first
started trundling truckloads of books
about a Melbourne bookshop he has
known pretty well every author
who has been in Melbourne, Aus-
tralian or imported. As £ , publisher, he
helped to push Mrs. /Eneas Gunn’s We
of the Never Never into its multitudes of
editions and helped her second volume,
The Little Black Princess, off the slips
with a resounding splash. One of his
discoveries was Ernestine Hill, and he
brought out the de luxe edition of Mary
Gilmore’s poems. His only interlude
from bookselling was in World War I;
he fought in France with the 38th Bn.,
gaining a Military Cross and a “mention.”
A bundle of energy, he organised Aus-
tralian Authors’ Week in 1927, is presi-
dent of the Victorian Booksellers’
Association and past-president of Legacy
and treasurer of Melbourne Tech. He
is 59.
Last week it was announced that Air-
Commodore Frank Whittle had been
recommended for an award of £lOO,OOO
in recognition of his contribution to jet-
propulsion flight. The award is to be
tax-free, and accountants have been flat-
out ever since trying to calculate what
sum would have had to be granted to
leave £lOO,OOO after deducting tax. It
is the traditional lot of an inventor to
wait a lifetime for recognition; Whittle’s
reward comes to him at 41. Going from
Leamington College to No. 4 Apprentices
Wing, R.A.F., he won a cadetship at the
R.A.F. College, Cranwell, and passed
through with a distinguished record. Fol-
lowed service with 111 Fighter Squadron
and as flying instructor and test-pilot,
after which he went to the Henlow School
of Aeronautical Engineering. Since then
jet-propulsion has absorbed most of his
time; thres years at Cambridge specialis-
ing in mechanical sciences can be counted
as part of his long-range plan, and from
1937 to 1946 he was on the R.A.F. special-
duty list working on a gas turbine for jet-
propulsion. The first flights of Glostef
planes fitted with the Whittle engine were
carried out in May, 1941, and it is safe to
say that his research has put Britain ahead
of the world in jet planes.
Stratheden passengers had their share
of good music on the recent trip to Aus-
tralia: three great musicians entertained
them gratis. Colin Campbell Ross, com-
poser, pianist and conductor, the new
organist at St. Paul’s Cathedral, Mel-
bourne, led the trio. The other two were
John Amadio, flautist, and A. G. Mar-
telli, ’cellist, of Perth. Campbell Ross
started playing the piano as a seven-year-
old and the organ eight years later.
In the Middle Ages ecclesiastical art
was the rule rather than the exception.
In Melbourne an example is an event, and
a 12ft. by Bft. fresco recently un-
veiled by the mayor of Brunswick at the
Congregational church in that suburb
aroused much interest. It is a modern
work depicting a brawny workman en-
closing in arms of terrific proportions the
Twelve Apostles and a few penitents who
have taken up their cross ; a group of dic-
tators is gathered around a chessboard
fighting for world power with armies
marching and symbols of the various
“isms.” It is the work of Leonard French,
a 19-year-old student of Melbourne
Technical College. He has obviously gone
to the modern Mexican school for in-
spiration and has done the job without a
join, a feat said to have been done before
only by one Mexican fresco painter.
French is a signwriter by profession.
Leopold George Dyke Acland, dead at
Christchurch, M.L., had a life of adven-
ture. Apart from active service in South
Africa and World War I, he had other
thrilling moments. On one occasion he
was out with an English officer and a
native sergeant to destroy a tiger that was
annoying peasants along the fringes of
the jungle in India. Catching Acland
unawares, the tiger pounced on him, but
fortunately the sergeant with a lucky shot
disposed of the tiger with the loss of an
arm to Acland. Relating his feelings
while in the clutches of the animal he
said he felt little concern apart from
the stinking breath of the tiger, which
had been dining off a dead horse before
deciding to change his diet to man. Once
on a small steamer on the way from New
Guinea Acland had as a shipmate Major
Neild, whose “gift of the gab” in the
N.S.W. Assembly had earned him the
name of “Jawbone.” Neild bet he would
argue the head off him, and the argument
lasted 48 hours with scarce a stop for
meals or sleep. Result; a draw.

bourne, silver-haired, gently-speaking
Frank Gibson, M.L.C., the chemist who
has held the office of Mayor in Fremantle,
a tight Labor constituency, for 26 years;
no small achievement for a Liberal. Now
an elder statesman of pharmacy, he was
entertained in Melbourne by the associ-
ated pharmaceutical organisations of
Australia. He was born at Egerton, out
Ballarat way, in 1879, when goldmining
was in boom. Not even a stick is left
today of his native village. Apprenticed
to A. G. Curthoys, uncle of former Mel-
bourne “Argus” editor R. L. Curthoys,
he qualified at the Melbourne College of
Pharmacy in 1902, then went west.
WESTRALIAN M.L.C.
opened a pharmacy at Cue, served a
term as Mayor of Leonora, migrated to
the coast in 1914 and set up as an
apothecary in Fremantle. He first be-
came its Mayor in 1919 and held office
till 1923. Back jn his robes three years
later he has hung on to the mayoral
chains ever since. His daughter is the
wife of Hal Colebatch.
Ethelbert Ambrook Southee, principal
of Hawkesbury Agricultural College
(N.S.W.) for the past 27 years, was and
still is a serious tennis-player, but the
mixture of humor, benevolence and
knowledge which makes up his character
comes from (a) doing a job he likes and
( b) living in beautiful surroundings at the
H.A.C, at Richmond, an old township on
the Nepean which has its own aura of
SOUTHEE OF HAWKESBURY.
history, beauty and adventure. Southee
was born at Cootamundra 58 years ago,
went to Sydney High School and Sydney,
Oxford and Cornell (U.S.A.) Universities,
collecting such things as his M.A. (Oxon.)
and B.Sc., and B.Sc. Agric. He was
N.S.W. Rhodes Scholar in 1913, won a
double-blue at Oxford for Rugby .and
athletics, and betweeh studies found time
to join the B.E.F. in 1914. He saw that
war out in Belgium, France and Italy,
gathered an 0.8. E. and a wife and took
charge of Hawkesbury, In the intervening
years thousands of his students have
gone on the land? into public and private
agricultural services; a goodly propor-
tion served in 1939-45. Southee’s gift is
that nobody forgets him, and he, despite
whatever changes time might bring, for-
gets nobody. It is enough to say of him
that his term there has made Hawkes-
bury’s reputation such that a diploma in
agriculture or dairying from that college
is highly respected throughout the
world.
Stan Phillips, “the man who has handled
more gold of the Bendigo goldfields than
any other man this century,” has com-
pleted 50 years as batteryman at the
North Deborah gold-mine. He has seen
more than £1,000,000-worth of gold pass
through his battery during the last nine
months. He still has a few years to go
to catch up to his father’s record; the
old chap worked in the Bendigo mines
from the age of nine until his death at 66.
H. E. Richards, N.R.M.A.’s new secre-
tary, began his career as a ship’s de-
serter. Dilating his heart in a boy’s walk-
ing race in Perth, he shipped on doctor’s
advice as cabin-boy in a British
barque. The ship was three years
out from Glasgow, and when the promised
run home developed into passage to Callao
in Peru, for cargo back to Singapore,
the crew, acting on the logical conclusion
of no ship, no more sea-time, decided to
burn her. Unfortunately the cabin-boy
didn’t rate inclusion in the plot, and, hear-
ing flames crackling in the oil-room be-
side his hammock, he gave the alarm, and
the fire was scotched. In the China Sea
they tried again. With the second mate
and bos’n standing guard with rifles over
the holds they’d fired with kerosene, young
Richards decided that sticking to the ship
would benefit neither his skin nor his
heart, and in exchange for the keys of the
rum locker he was allowed to lower a
dinghy. Passed by the Russian fleet en
route to disaster in Port Arthur, the “de-
serter” was picked up by another wind-
jammer, landed in Singapore, where he
joined the Straits Tin Trading Co. to earn
his passage home, but stayed 19 years,
ending as manager of the company’s
Penang branch. Followed service in
France with the King’s Own Yorkshire
Infantry, and a dose of mustard gas.
Back in the Straits, his children’s health
compelled an exodus, and in 1923 he
opened a soap factory in Waterloo, Syd-
ney. Two years later he joined N.RM.A.
as chief clerk, becoming asst, secretary
the next year. Main concern now is the
projected 1500-car park under Hyde Park,
though cars are forgotten when a four-
master berths in the Harbor.
A novelist figured in Air Force Week
in Melbourne. He is Flight-Lieutenant
Ivan Francis Southall, D.F.C., chosen by
the R.A.A.F. to typify Coastal Command
Day. It is a far cry from novel-writing
to submarine-sinking around the English
coast and in the Bay of Biscay, but his
110,000-word novel. Thou Shalt Not Pass

Women's Letters
From Sydney
There’s everything from, the cobweb of
Limerick lace to wrought-iron in the Arts
and Crafts show in the Education Gal-
leries. The show was opened last Friday
by Professor Waterhouse, standing on the
dais behind a wrought-iron railing, kicked
by a wrought-iron gate, and reminded that
tempus fugit by a wrought-iron clock on
the wall. This year’s display is vibrant
with color, so that from the exhibits of the
Double Bay studio in the outer gallery—
the gay hangings, the smooth weave of
the fabrics—to the saucy dolls in their
glasshouse at the lower end of the inner
room the visitor is in an atmosphere of
blithe creations.
Lace-making and silver craft show prob-
ably the fewest devotees. Dorothy Wager
has a case of jewels in antique settings;
evejj a Medici might not have despised the
small jewelled dagger brooch. There s
some Limerick lace, and there’s an exhibit
of point lace, both worthy of any trous-
seau. Marion Darsow’s miniature garden
and her flower arrangement were admired
by all.
The hems of long frocks and fallen
autumn leaves swished together as the
guests walked from their cars —parking
became quite a problem—to All Saints,
Woollahra, for the marriage of Margaret
Christmas to Gerald Hewson on Monday
evening of last week. The 200 guests
were later entertained at Romano’s, which
was reserved for the occasion. Scotch
whisky and champagne flowed magni-
ficently,, and at 2 a.m. the party was only
starting to break up. Brother George
Christmas gave the bride away, and Betty
Goodwin and niece Gail Goodall were
the bridesmaids; best man was Finlay
Munro, formerly A.D.C. to Sir Leslie Wil-
son. At Romano’s Margaret’s mother,
Mrs. Hi P. Christmas, and the Frank
Packers received the guests.
Margaret carried arum-lilies and wore
her veil wreathed in orange-blossom just
a week arrived from Paris. These two tra-
ditional bridal touches were admired by
guests and onlookers. So was the wedding-
frock of rich ivory satin with its medieval
neckline gleaming with pearl embroidery.
The skirt was long and flowing and had
the train cut into it. The veil was an
exquisitely fine affair of Brussels-lace
mounted on silk tulle. Mellowed by 100
years, this family heirloom was loaned by
Miss Dot Waine, a friend of the Christ-
mas family. Off-the-shoulder frocks of
white organza, the skirts very full, the
necklines soft with fichus, were worn by
the bridesmaids. Bride’s mother, Mrs.
H. P. Christmas, looked the ideal hostess
in oyster-grey chiffons rich with steel
and silver beading.
Vinia de Loitte, “Ada and Elsie” of
radio fame, columnist Jim McDougall,
Minnie Love, with many stars in their
train, are putting on an afternoon and
evening performance for the Women
Writers’ parcels for Britain. June 4,
Macquarie Auditorium are the time and
place. A Parcels for Britain auction will
be a feature of the evening show. Have
you anything you. can spare for this
auction?
As a charmer of audiences Glenda
Raymond has little to learn. This Vic-
torian girl, who goes off to Milan for
five years’ study, sang to a crowded Town
Hall last week. The voice, in spite of
the restraining grip of laryngitis, rose in
triumph in a mixed bill which included
“Depuis le Jour,” “Una Voce,” “Chris-
topher Robin,” “One Fine Day,” and,
with David Allen, duets. At the very
end of a long, long list of encores slim
young Australia in her gleaming white
satin frock, panniered, and bright here
and there with a flower embroidery,
sang inevitably “Home, Sweet Home!”
In this State of acute house shortage,
the line “Give me my lowly thatched
cottage again” struck to the deeps.
Gay as a field of spring flowers
was the frock worn by pianist
Eunice Garland, of the prettily-shaped
head. The bodice was slim, and bared
on one shoulder; the skirt was full and
about ankle-length.
Nobody had thought to put any deco-
ration on the Town Hall stage, which
looked so cold that the spotlight might
easily have been taken for the Aurora
Australis. Noticed were Mr. and Mrs.
Rogers, of Vacuum Oil, the C. R. McKeri-
hans. Hector Crawford, Professor and
Mrs. Fawsitt, singers Peggy Bell and
Gladys Verona. Gladys is enthusiastic
over Glenda’s future. Professor Fawsitt
was eulogistic over “Depuis le Jour.” But
it was Mrs. Harald Bowden who had the
last word. She applauded vigorously
during the concert, she waited to see the
singer, and then said “There’s nothing
now to do but fold our tents like the Arabs
and silently steal away!” Then she sud-
denly laughed ; and added: “But I don’t
think the Arabs are doing that.”
Benno Moiseiwitsch commences his
season in the Town Hall tonight. And
until you have heard this pianist play
the music of Chopin, you haven’t really
heard Poland’s poet of composers. Any-
way, Benno, with his magnificent head,
his air of dignified leisure (as though
hurry, after all, was only for commerce
and the market-place), was the subject of
a few parties in Sydney last week. He
was just thawing out after his tour of
Maoriland —a very successful one. Even
director Arthur Tait admitted that. A
nice, cosy get-together for press and
music was held in the boardroom of
J.C.W.’s offices. Pianist Trixie Tange
(Mrs. Evans) .was there, and Mrs. Harald
Bowden, and Mrs. Arthur Tait brought
along a bright smile and just the right
degree of “new look.” Moiseiwitsch, a
very proud father, talks of daughter
Tanya’s success in stage-designing. She
designs the sets for many Covent Garden
operas for Noel Coward and Cochran
shows.

If only the solemn U.N.O. elders at
Lake Success could be transported to
the Sydney Town Hall on June 21 they
might learn a lot about uniting the nations
of the world. According to the Folk
Lore Association of Australia it can be
done by song and dance. And what’s,
more, they are out to prove it yet again
by the Folk Lore Festival. On June 21
and 22 all the nations of the earth,
seemingly, will disport in amity on the
floor of the Town Hall while wellwishers
will sool them on from the galleries.
Russia, Spain and Austria, England and
Wales, Scotland and Ireland, Latvia and
Finland, Denmark and Sweden, Maoriland
will air their national costumes, shake out
their flags, sing their songs. Clement
Hosking will direct the Folk Song choir.
Ailsa Applette will be the organist.,
Up from Melbourne for the University
sports, the P. L, Colemans, with son
Kevin. Theirs was a rush visit, but one or
two theatres had a chance of viewing Mrs.
Coleman’s good and always very femi-
nine frocking. She sings a paean in praise
of the good manners of this city’s shop
and hotel staffs. They motored south
again in the teeth of Sunday’s bitter wind.
From London:
Australia had St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields
for its Anzac Day celebration. De Witt
Battye, of Newcastle, gave the address from
the text: “And a young man followed
him.” The Duke and Duchess of Glouces-
ter were both there, the latter looking 100
per cent, better than when she left Aus-
tralia. Viscount Montgomery, fresh from
Berlin, looked grave and showed none of
his normal sparkle, but Air-Marshal Tedder
arrived vigorously, whilst that veteran Field-
Marshal Birdwood, nearing his ninetieth
year, came simply bouncing everywhere like
a 16-year-old schoolboy. The Cowries were
not one whit different from their old selves.
Viscount Bruce looked tired.
All things point to the success of the
Lute Drummond testimonial matinee on
August 5. On that date the Theatre
Royal will be the gathering-place of
Sydney’s brightest talent. The bill
to be presented includes the Bodenweiser
Ballet, singers James Wilson and Betty
Spicer, fresh from Melbourne Opera
triumphs. Actress Jean Robertson, the
A.B.C.’s Frank Clewlow are having a
hand in the brew, of which Wilfred
Thomas will be compare. There is a glit-
tering constellation of radio, stage and
opera stars. Mrs. Florence Taylor is tHe
president of the committee. Mrs. A. E.
Grace, Josephine Marks, Strella Wilson,
and Alice Prowse are taking keen and
active interest in the progress of the testi-
monial.
The English Speaking Union, to the
pleasure of whose music circle Lute often
contributed programmes and intimate
little talks, the Queen Victoria Music
Club and almost every music and drama
group in the city are arranging subsidiary
entertainments to swell the total of the
final effort. There is already about £2OO
in the fund. Nor do Lute’s friends and
pupils in London forget her. Lady
Gowrie is patron of the fund, and old
students such as Ken Neate and Joan
Hammond are arranging suitable expres-
sion of their appreciation.
From Melbourne
Councillors and their wives held a late-
afternoon party in the reception-room at
the Town Hall to bid au revoir to the
Lord Mayor, Sir Raymond Connelly, and
his wife, before they left for England xn
the Stratheden. Small pink begonias,
cyclamens and autumn foliage made the
floral background. Sir Thomas Nettle-
fold, who will act as Lord Mayor until
a new one is elected, presented the guests-
of-honor with a pair of silver entree
dishes copied from an eighteenth-century
design. Lady Connelly’s French-wool
frock was in pale-mignonette green ; there
were graduated flat tucks on the full skirt
and the bodice was slim-fitting. Her
black-velvet bandeau hat had clusters of
pastel-blue and mauve feathers at one
side. Mrs. V. Solly wore an aqua-blue
frock beneath her black Persian-lamb
coat. Mrs. J. S. Disney covered her black
frock with a silver-fox cape stole} her
hat featured white feather wings. Mrs.
O. J. Nilsen had brown hat and acces-
sories for her almond-green ensemble
and cocoa-fox furs. Mrs. W. J. Brens put
a glow to black suit and silver-fox furs
with the gaily-striped taffeta on her black
hat. Mrs. J. W. Ferguson’s black suit was
worn with an osprey-trimmed matching
hat. Mrs. Gordon de Lisle highlighted
her grey suit with a pastel-pink straw
hat. Mrs. Mac Hume’s black broderie-
Anglaise frock was ‘worn under a fur
wrap. Mrs. Burns Campbell was tailored
in grey and wore black accessories.
Here is Shirley Browne, who made a
pretty bride when she was married at
St. John’s Church, Latrobe-street. Shirley,
only daughter of Professor G. S. Browne,
chose a gown of ivory-moire taffeta, the
bodice of which was fastened with tiny
crystal buttons to the neck, which was
finished with a Peter Pan collar. The
full-flowing skirt ended in a train, and
her filmy-tulle veil was caught to the
head with a coronet of orange blossoms;
her bouquet was of gardenias, white
nerines and azaleas. Attending the bride
were Betty Phillip and Pat Kingsley-
Norris ; both wore slim-fitting frocks of
delphinium-- blue French velvet; the
skirts, gathered at the waistline, fell in
soft folds to the floor. Their bandeaux
of velvet were finished at each side with
velvet flowers in the same tonings as their
frocks and they carried posies of cycla-
men-toned nerines. Their silk mittens,
made a charming touch. Bridegroom is
Colin, the second son of Mrs. E. Baldwin
and the late Padre Baldwin ; his brother
Harry was best man and Tom Austin
groomsman.
Professor Browne gave a reception at
Grosvenor, Toorak. Assisting him to re-
ceive guests was Mrs. Baldwin, whose
ensemble and hat were in mist-blue ton-
ings. Mrs. Harry Baldwin’s smoky-blue-
wool coat was worn over a scarlet-wool
frock; her hat of smoky-blue-felt was
trimmed with soft veiling. Janet Bowen
Pain’s beech-brown-crepe ballerina frock
was worn under a dyed-ermine jacket,
her hat was a wreath of pink-and-orchid-
toned French roses on silk crinoline straw.
Mrp. Bernard Heinze’s cloche hat and
tailored coat were black, her furs silver-
fox. Mrs. Desmond Hollywood’s Char-,
treuse-moire taffetas were cut on bal-
lerina lines. Mrs. W. J. O'Grady gave
distinction to a jacket-suit of apple-green-
wool romaine with a veiled hat in a
deeper shade of green. With General
Kingsley-Norris, who proposed the toast
of the bridal couple, was his wife, smart
in black and small floral hat, Mrs. T.
Alan McKay contrasted her black jacket-
suit with touches of blue and repeated the
blue note in the feathers trimming her
black hat.
A newly-decorated Tivoli was the set-
ting for the gay and romantic “Marinka,”
which began a new era of entertainment
at this old playhouse. Sonya Yarr, as
the Countess Landovska, wore many
lovely gowns ; t one of the most beautiful
was of old-gold satin banded in a deep
tone of brown. Kathy Barr, in the title
role, wore one stunning gown of pale-
blue chiffon which had the long skirt
finely-pleated from high waistline to hem.
Norman Lawrence, as Prince Rudolph,
raised a pleasing voice in several catchy
melodies. Gladys Moncrieff, who was
acclaimed as she took her seat, adorned
her silver-foxes with purple orchids.
Mrs. Garnet Carroll embellished with
sequins in a deeper tone her purple gown.
Mrs. Frank Martin also bedecked her
black chiffons with glittering sequins.
Lady Linton, who was accompanied by
her son Dick, included in her party Joy
Beattie. Mrs. Frank Tait set off her
titian coloring with a black ensemble.
Mrs. Fred Irvine chose a filmy-black
chiffon-and-lace gown worn over silver
lam 6 ; Zara Davies’s lovely gown was of
shot-green taffeta ; Margot Henry wore
with her pink-chiffon strapless frock a
matching sari over her dark hair.
To welcome home their son and
daughter-in-law, Dr. and Mrs. Kennedy
Burnside, and their infant granddaughter,
who have just returned from England,
Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Burnside, of Toorak,
gave a cocktail-party and buffet dinner
at the Australia. Mrs. Burnside greeted
her guests wearing a lily-of-the-valley
green-crepe jacket suit and brown Arctic-
fox cape; her upturned swathed satin
turban in the same delicate shade of
green had a side cascade of green, brown
and amber ostrich feathers. Mrs.
Kennedy Burnside wore a tailored black
suit and topcoat. Lady Chauvel’s full-
length dyed-ermine coat was worn with
a brown hat; Lady Beaurepaire covered
her soft-pink frock with a dyed-
ermine coat, and with it wore a soft-
green velvet off-the-face hat; Mrs.
Martin Wang, wife of the Chinese Consul,
wore a national dress of rose-pink crepe
and a silver-fox cape. Mrs. A. G.
Warner’s black-crepe jacket had grey
squirrel to top it; her small black hat
carried fine black veiling. A hip-length
black Indian-lamb coat, black frock and
black coq-feather-trimmed hat were Mrs.
H. Sellers’s choice. Mrs. Balcombe Quick
chose a sage-green wool-jacket suit and
matching felt hat; Mrs. A. E. Coates
sported a white French beret with her
black Persian-lamb coat.
James and Janet Bowen Pain celebrated
their ninth wedding anniversary with a
late-afternoon party to which over 100
guests were invited. Venue was the
Matthew Lang cellars, made gay with
lovely autumn flowers. Janet’s long frock
of cigar-brown crepe had frills of creamy
Alengon lace at the neck and sleeves;

trimming of matching ribbon bows en-
circled her Edwardian hair-do. Lady
Fraser’s hyacinth-blue ostrich-feather hat

invited almost 150 people to Menzies’ to

tailored suit, pastel-blue gloves and coq-
feather-trimmed black hat, received the
guests. Lady Olivier wore a full-length

brimmed black felt hat was trimmed with
black velvet bows. Mrs. W. J. Hutchin-

BRADMAN
By A. G. Moyes.
It is fitting that the appearance of this book should coincide
with what must be Don Bradman’s last season in cricket.
No man has captured the imagination and affection of the
cricketing public or benefited the game more than Bradman
has, and his biography will be welcomed by cricket-lovers
and sportsmen all over the world.
Of particular interest are the detailed comparisons made
between Bradman and those outstanding cricketers of the
past who might challenge his supremacy, such as Victor
Trumper. Many other personalities stud the pages of this
book, which is coloured by vivid descriptions of the glorious
and exciting innings that Bradman has added to the history
of cricket. • Price 10/6 (post. 4d.).

Since the war ended the trend in busi-
ness has been increased sales at high
and higher prices. This is the result of
scarcities of materials and labor, com-
bined with good seasons, a buoyant
national income and “full”—perhaps over-
full” —employment at high and rising
wage-rates. Last year merchandise came
forward in better volume from both local
and overseas sources, though quality was,
for the most part, below pre-war
standards.
For retailers it has meant continuance
of a sellers’ market with expanding turn-
over. Here are percentage changes in
aggregate sales of 22 Sydney stores com-
pared with the corresponding period of
the previous year:

1947- +23.0 +17.1
Sales for the 12 months to June 30 last
were over 91 p.c. above the 1938-39 level,
owing largely to rising prices, which are
still on the up-grade.
This big, well-handled, progressive and
more-than-century-old universal provider
shared in the general experience; its sales
were a record in both volume and value.
But owing to the complex nature of
the business—stocks, which range from
hardware to fashion goods, include many
slow- as well as quick-moving lines, and
country as well as city sales figure largely
in turnover —the management hais a wider
range of problems to contend with than
most other traders.
Abolition of War-time (Co.) Tax took
some of the sting out of advancing costs,
which were aggravated by introduction of
the 40-hour week. Net earnings
advanced £13,164, making the improve-
ment £44,107 over the last three years.
That was after allowing for depreciation
(£61,909, up £5090 last term), and adding
£11,240 to the, tax reserve (£399,138).
The £158,868 of profit was easily the
best since the present co. bought the busi-
ness from the Hordern family for
£2,900,000 in 1926, It was a shade over
7 p.c. on the £2,000,000 of share capital,
of which £750,000 carries a cumulative
7 p.c,, subject to a T2\ p.c. cut under the
N. S. Wales Interest Reduction Act of
1931, with the right to advance with the
ords. from a minimum 5.8 p.c. to their
original contract rate. The distribution
was kept at an all-round 6 p.c., and the
£38,868 that remained lifted general re-
serves to £186,726. In addition there are
allowances for depreciation and altera-
tions totalling £221,606 —further modern-
isation of the store will be undertaken
when materials and labor are available.
The financial position continued to im-
prove :

The more-or-less liquid surplus (£946.214)
was £52,232 stronger than at the previous
balance. Stocks (up £483,559) catch the
eye; they are more than twice the 1937
figure. The growth, due largely to the
rise in prices, is also an insurance against
further price-lifts, scarcity of some lines
and delays in delivery. Last year’s lift to
this item was met mostly by addition of
£458,860 to the amount coming to credi-
tors, etc. —the etcetera is an unspecified
provision for contingencies.
With prices and costs still rising and
gross margins narrowed by official edict,
continued expansion of turnover will be
necessary if profits are to be maintained.
The cost of living has risen steeply over
the last six months. Whereas lifts of Is.
in the basic wage were common in 1947,
rises since have been at two and three
times that amount. These wage increases
are an element of income as well as costs,
but the greatest addition to the national
income is the expanding return from pri-
mary products —wool, wheat, metals, etc.,
are expected to bump up the figure by
well over £lOO million for the year to
June 30 next. The pressure of purchas-
ing power will tend to lift spending and
prices to still higher levels, for a while at
any rate. The best way to cushion this
all-round inflationary pressure would be
to increase local production. Release of
some non-productive manpower now in
Government employ for productive enter-
prise would Ije a big help in this direction,
and so would cuts in -present high rates of
co. taxation, which conflict with incentives
to increase production. The alternatives
are a continued rise in costs, prices and
imports, all of which threaten much
trouble later on.
Price of the co.’s scrip has remained on
a fairly even keel in the market, which
counts on maintenance of an all-round
6 p.c. div. On this basis the ords. at
295. 9d. and the prefs. at 30s. each return
approximately 4 p.c. Excluding the re-
serve for depreciation, etc., net tangible
cover is 58s. 3d. prefs. and 225. lid. ords.

Caught between the nutcrackers of ex-
panding costs and fixed charges for in-
creased services, profits of the trustee
cos. are being compressed. How long
the squeeze will continue depends largely
upon how soon the growth in costs can
be checked. And it is difficult to say
at the moment exactly when costs will
reach their upper limit; much depends
upon the course of prices, which is still
upwards, though there are signs of the
grade becoming easier. Still, when we
settle down to more “normal” conditions
it will be a very different equilibrium
from that prevailing pre-war. The
“Wild Cat,” therefore, believes that the
time has arrived, and that the trustee cos.
have a strong case, for revision of the
basis on which their charges are levied.
These charges are anchored by legisla-
tion, and Have remained unchanged since
the closing decades of last century. On
the other hand costs have risen, and
continue to rise, on the floodtide of infla-
tion, which has been accelerated by two
world wars and by a maze of socialistic
and other legislation, while earnings have
been retarded by the official blanket
thrown over capital values and rents and
by the Government’s frequent turns of
the cheap-money screw.
The alert and enterprising Union, which
set up in Melbourne 63 years ago, is
now second-biggest thing of its kind in
Australia. It enjoys strong connections
in pastoral circles, and has branches at
Sydney, Brisbane, Townsville, Too-
woomba, Rockhampton and Albury, with
agencies at London and Glasgow. The
Albury office was opened last term. Over
the last two years net earnings have
averaged only £8313, compared with an
average of £10,499 for the six years to
close of accounts in 1946, and £13,098
for the six years before that.
The co. doesn’t broadcast the volume
of trusts on its books, but gross earnings
from all sources stepped up £7557 last
term:

Exes, (up £9564) took all the gain and
£2007 besides, leaving the net result at
£7310, poorest for the last 34 years. It
was 5.3 p.c. on the £137,500 of capital
as against 6.7, 8.5, 11.2, 7.1, 5.3, 5.8, 7.6
and 10 p.c. back to 1940. On share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves com-
bined) the £7310 was a mere 3.2 p.c.
Still, the div. was kept at 6 p.c., and the
board gives no hint that the rate is likely
to be reduced. During the 1947 term
the co. was engaged in litigation before
the High Court, against whose decision it
has appealed to the Privy Council, where
the case is due for hearing at an early
date. It is not clear whether legal costs
have been included in exes, or covered
by provision for contingencies made be-
fore writing 4he p. and 1. figures into the
published accounts..
At end February capital and reserves,
together with provision for taxation, etc.
(£15,145), were represented by freeholds
£148,060, Government securities £74,090,
cash £19,956 and debtors’ balances £l6lB.

The co. is in the woolbroking, pastoral-
finance, stock- and station-agency and
merchandise business in Victoria and
southern N. S. Wales, and has been since
1889, and it was a proprietary concern
for many years before that. Last term
the story was again one of a good season
and high and rising prices; a happy
combination that occurs at rare in-
tervals. It tends to obscure the effects
of high and rising costs upon the national
economy as well as upon net earning
capacity in rural industries,'which is a
matter of average rather than individual
annual returns. Also, as the eye sweeps
down the profits column in the table, it
is well to remember that £470,000
of fresh share (£375,000) and premium
(£95,000) money was gathered during the
four years to the close of accounts in
1941, Each pound of capital had the
support and assistance of 255. 3d. of
reserves in 1937, as against 10s. 6d. at end
March last. Still, the co. is well-equipped,
financially and otherwise, to win what-
ever returns are to be had from this class
of business.
Australia’s wool cheque for the 10
months to end April last was £43,546,323
heavier than for the corresponding period
of the previous season, though there was
little change in the number of bales sold:
10 Mths. Average

1948 .. 2,453,186 120,392,901 38.97 d.
The average price per pound was 54.9
p.c. above the average for the whole of
the 1946-47 season. And the 1947-48
figures include only 16,232 bales bought
by J.O. as against 37,281 bales for the
previous period. Livestock also fetched
very high prices.
The co. sold an extra 937 bales, but
the carryover (25,410 bales) was 14,460
bales heavier, due to the effect of strikes
on shipping. Gross earnings from all
sources (up £53,315 after providing for
bad and doubtful debts, etc.) reflect the
improved price position:

1948 .. 83,048 332,894 279,699 84
The jump of £40,790 in exes, was due
mainly to wage and price lifts and partly
to extra provision for taxation (£25,500,
up £6500). After sending £6OOO (up
£3000) to the staff fund, the net result
benefited by £9525, reaching £47,295, or
7.5 p.c. on capital as against 6, 4.5 and
4.5 p.c, for the three preceding years.
The div. was lifted from 6 p.c. to 7|
p.c., making the average 5.8 p.c. over
the last decade. The narrow margin be-
tween earnings and distributions suggests
that provision for contingencies has not
been skimped.
Here are balance-sheet figures:
1940. 1942. 1947. 1948.

Cash, etc. .. 9,005 34,535 16,230 167,802
The shrinkage of £73,484 in advances and
growth of £151,572 in cash, etc., reflect
season and prices. The amount coming
to creditors (up £102,894) includes clients’
balances on current account.
The immediate outlook is for another
good season, though how long present
prices for wool and livestock will con-
tinue it is difficult to say. The recent
appearance of Russia as a buyer at Aus-
tralian wool sales, after an absence of
about 20 years, and the importance
attached to textiles in the British export
drive, together with continuance of
American aid to Europe, are encouraging
factors. Despite cuts in the U.S. tariff
on Australian wool purchases on U.S.
account have dwindled; for the nine
months to end March last they were 16.9
p.c. of our total exports of greasy wool
as against 31,8 p.c. for the corresponding
period of the previous season. Increased
purchases by U.K. filled the gap. From
the producers’ point of view rising costs
and high taxation are nuts that will be
difficult to crack when nature and markets
become less kind.

74TH ANNUAL MEETING OF
THE COLONIAL MUTUAL LIFE
ASSURANCE SOCIETY LIMITED
“Last year cash payments from our three Depart-
ments to policy holders amounted to £3,167,926 or
more than £lO,OOO on every working day of the
year,” said the Hon. Sir Harry Lawson, K.C.M.G.,
the Society’s Chairman, in presenting the Annual
Report on 26th May.
“Since its inception the Society had paid over
£51,000,000 to its policy holders.”
o
o
Record New Business
During 1947, Sums Assured under new Life
Policies amounted to £32,497,874, over
£5,000,000 more than the new business
written in 1946. This was gratifying in that
it was a good indication of the growing appre-
ciation of Life Assurance in general, and of
The Colonial Mutual Life in particular.
The total income of the Society also reached
a new high figure of almost £9,000,000.
ë
Investments Growing
Interest rates on securities in
which it is sound to invest Life
Assurance Funds remained low
throughout the world. The Board,
however, was very conscious of
the vital necessity of a reasonable rate of interest being
earned upon the Funds entrusted to it by policy holders.
The Society had invested £1,269,285 (2.6% of its assets)
in carefully selected Company Shares. A further avenue
of investment was House Purchase finance. The total
amount now invested in homes was £3,058,366.
1937 1947
Expenses Remain Low
In a year when the cost of
goods and services had risen uni-
versally there had been no
marked rise in the Society’s ex-
penses of management.
During 1947 the total Funds of
the Society increased (by the
record amount of £4,132,684) to
£47,755,395. And here the Chair-
man drew attention to a fairly widespread misconception, in
that Life Assurance Funds were often referred to as Reserves.
C 2
Reserve Funds
When a manufacturer or trader spoke
of Reserve Funds, he usually meant
the resources which he had over and
above the capital he normally
required for his business activities.
His Reserve Funds were his
margin of safety. Life Assurance
Funds frequently were thought to
be of the same nature. Actually,
a Life Assurance Fund was the amount required to meet
inevitable payments to policy holders.
Bright Future
In conclusion. Sir Harry said Life Assurance was
flourishing as never before. Throughout the ages
men had always desired and searched for security.
The idea of Life Assurance had done much to fulfil
this desire, and while there had been a great develop-
ment of State social services, such as old age and
widows’ pensions, the demand for something more
than these basic benefits was growing at an increasing
rate. This co-operative Society was well equipped
to undertake this type of service to the Community.
It was difficult to imagine any organisation that could
provide these services more efficiently and cheaply.

“Yowi”: Silver Valley, a few
miles from Herberton (N.Q.),
is to be given another over-
haul. A third of a century
ago rich silver-lead deposits
there were responsible for
the erection of smelters, the
employment of 400 men, and a
township that boasted three
hotels, a like number of stores
and a couple of butchers’ shops.
A German-financed co. that
looked like getting, something
done was wound - up when
World War I became a fact.
Along with other highly miner-
alised areas nearby, Silver Valley
has been in the doldrums since.
Recently Cairns businessman
Harry Thompson acquired a
number of leases in the Herber-
ton mineral belt, and got a
southern mining expert to look
them over. One result is that a
southern co. has taken an option
over six leases at Silver Valley.
Thompson also believes that
adjacent tin areas can be worked
at a profit. He reckons it won’t
be long before Herberton is
back on the map again as a pro-
ducer.

“Birre Gurra”: Activity on
the Tennant Creek (N.T.) gold-
field, which is just starting to get
back to pre-war level, will be
given a fillip by recent crush-
ings—794 tons from the Whippet
yielded 2586 ounces, and 508
tons from the Skipper 2112
ounces. Jim English, part-owner
of the Whippet, has confirmed
press reports that a Melbourne
syndicate had offered £200,000
for the mine; but despite the fact
that he and his partner secured
the then-abandoned lease for
£lOO the offer is likely to be
turned down. Although there is
still a lot of tax-free gold in the
Whippet, a sale at the figure
mentioned would evoke whoops
of delight, as well as a sheaf of
assessment-forms from the tax-
gatherer. It is only in compara-
tively recent times that miners on
the Tennant have realised that
they have to go down a bit for
the best ore.

North of the Harbor.
There is no single picture at
the North Sydney Art Society’s
exhibition at Mosman Town
Hall likely to set alight the adja-
cent parts of the Harbor —a
stretch of water that has seen
many artists. Nevertheless it is
the most impressive exhibition
seen for some time in Sydney.
Lance Solomon’s “Page River,
Gundy” and “Black Mountain”
are not his best work, but still
are stamped with his individu-
ality. “Black Mountain” is sub-
dued, with a hint of drama in
the dark skyline, and the other
painting, fuller and richer, is
an observation of the bend of a
river, with white running water
and trees painted in the distinc-
tive Solomon manner.
Erik Langker’s “Evening,
Ball’s Head,” is small, balanced,
concise, with a gem-like quality
in the clarity and perfect bal-
ance of grey sky and harbor
water. Howard Ashton’s “Grey
Range” is the best of his exhibits,
showing hills and meticulously-
observed grim rock, to which
light and the necessary alchemy
of composition give drama. An-
other Ashton painting, “Sunlight
Hill,” has the same ruggedness
without the quality.
Paintings by Hanke, Richard
Ashton, James R. Jackson,
Douglas Pratt and A. J. Sher-
man are, more or less, cross-
sections of their known work.
Rufus Morris, with “Early
Morning Loading, Kiama,” has
a good concentration of color,
character and realism, and Hilda
Proudfoot’s “A Study,” which
conspicuously lacks grace and
balance, has, at least, an almost
uncomfortable vitality. Her
work indicates that problems of
technique trouble her more than
lack of perception. Alan R.
Grieve’s “The Fisherman,” in
spite of some remarkable crudity
of execution, has force, a little
poetry, and a wine-dark sea.
Not only at Mosman, but in
movements such &s the Kuringai
Theatre Guild and the Inde-
pendent Theare at North Syd-
ney, there is ample evidence of
the value of spontaneous local
organisations in the arts. The
north side of the harbor is for-
tunate in having these activities,
and, in the long run, Sydney as a
whole will be the richer for
them.

The first thing that strikes the
eye on entering the exhibition of
the Art Group of the Bread and
Cheese Club at the Velasquez
Galleries, Melbourne, is a nude
by Charles Compton with one leg
apparently severed at the knee.
This is an illusion produced by
foreshortening—Mr. Compton is
a careful, academic painter
whom nobody would suspect of
emulating the moderns. Henri
Adelstein, who displays a bone-
less “Study of a Woman,” is the
only member who belongs to
that persuasion. The rest of
the show ranges from good to
bad and mediocre. Bertram
Bryning has an attractive study
of the Brisbane River, and in
“Quiet Evening, Lome,” A. J.
Salmon has sensitively caught
the soft tones and mystery of
twilight on the ocean.
"Marinka."
What with a lightning face-
lift and the importation of this
romantic operetta, Tivoli
regulars would hardly know
their Bourke-street playground.
The action starts in an open-air
theatre in Connecticut and then
adjourns to the Schoenbrun
Palace gardens, where the sad
tale of “Mayerling” unfolds
itself with more or less musical
embellishments to a happy end-
ing. A solemn note is struck
by Leslie Victor, done into a life-
like reproduction of the late
Emperor Franz losef, pacing his
palace musing on the future of
his empire and the amorous ad-
ventures of the heir apparent.
The celebrated Rudy is in the
hands of Norman Lawrence, a
baritone with an American
accent, no great acting ability
and a voice that is good in parts.
Kathy Barr, as his inamorata,
helps to wreck the Austrian
Empire with a sweet soprano
and an artless manner. Alec
Kellaway, looking extraordi-
narily like his screen relation,
is Bratfisch, the prince’s cabby,
and provides most of the comic
business as an admiral in the
Imperial Navy. Sonya Yarr, as
a former mistress of the heir
apparent, supplies an American
translation of a Russian countess
and gets any of the laughs left
over.
The male chorus works its way
through the military costuming
of the Austrian Army and sings
one good chorus, “Old Man
Danube.” Martin Rubinstein,
Laurel Martyn and an admirable
corps de ballet give several
scenes artistic distinction and,
as a Hungarian delegation to
the Imperial throne, provide a
model for all such functions.

Chico Marx has been added to
the current “Vive La Venus” at
Sydney Tiv. Divested of the
glamor of the screen and the arts
of the film producer he turns out
to be an amiable bloke who does
eccentric things with a piano,
reminisces about his childhood —
when his chief occupation was
chasing chickens —and makes a
leisurely appeal to an audience’s
heartstrings. His performance
on the piano suggests that, if
things had been different, he
might have been a great virtuoso.
Films.
“The Naked City” (Sydney
Victory): A fine study by Mark
Hellinger of New York and its
people, a murder and the Law
in action. Barry Fitzgerald, as
the sleuth, eventually stumps
home in the small hours like a
tired old bulldog with the rat in
his teeth.
“An Ideal Husband” (Sydney
Embassy): An excellent English
production of Oscar Wilde’s lan-
guid comedy.
“The Black Arrow” (Sydney
Lyceum): Has the schoolkids
hoarsely barracking for marks-
men who can split an infinitive
at 50 paces, and for Dick Shel-
ton (Louis Hayward), who
speaks Olde Englishe and emits
a steady beam of chivalry.
“If Winter Comes” (Sydney
Liberty): Walter Pidgeon and
Deborah Kerr in their worst
effort to date. Gloomy, with
two deaths, a matrimonial de-
sertion and a suicide.
“Forever Amber” (Sydney
Regent) and' “Duel in the Sun”
(Sydney State): Technicolor
marathons highly recommended
to those who like raspberry
syrup and whipped cream well
sweetened with sugar.
A stack of dusty, cobwebbed
gargoyles give “Uncle Silas”
(Sydney Esquire) a faint air of
mystery that could be dispelled
in ten minutes by any keen
vacuum-cleaner salesman. The
audience does suffer a mild
though, at the hands of
Paxinou, villainy in
French, a real witch who likes
to hurdle tombstones singing
snatches of the Marseillaise.
“Good News” (St. lames):
For whom?
A.B.C.'s Vocal and Con-
certo Competition.
In winning the N.S.W. final
from two other pianists and
three singers 19-year-old Laur-
ence Davis was able to call on
sufficient technical brilliance and
interpretative feeling to offset the
showiness of his pianism—as he
matures he will no doubt realise
that a Moiseiwitsch, a Schnabel
or a Barere has no need to
bolster his art with exaggerated
swayings and keyboard creep-
ings. Such a warm, vital and
gay work as the Mendelssohn
Concerto No. 1 in G Minor ad-
mirably suited the young pianist’s
temperament, and he made the
most —almost too much —of it.
Leonie Stredwick played the
First Movement of the Rach-
maninoff No. 1 Concerto in F
Sharp Minor —not as spectacular
as the second but perhaps finer
in merit—with studied skill
and considerable forcefulness.
Michael Mann’s reading of the
Second and Third Movements of
the Mozart Concerto No. 24 in
C Minor, K 491, was instinct
with refinement; a sensitive
grace in particular marked the
slower passages.
Of the singers, Doris Dale’s
coloratura, although adequate as
to flexibility, was unable to cope
with the emotional depths of
Ophelia’s Aria from Thomas’s
“Hamlet.” loan Sutherland re-
vealed a voice of excellent
quality, with a range over the
best part of three octaves, in
“Elizabeth’s Greeting” from
“Tannhauser.”
The orchestra under Eugene
Goossens gave solid support to
the soloists, and, as its own solo
contributions, conjured up some
of the florid grace of seven-
teenth-century France, with the
Cortot arrangement of Cou-
perin’s Concerto in the theatri-
cal style, swirled with great zest
through De Falla’s “Fire Dance”
and wound up an excellent con-
cert with the lively Polka and
Fugue from McWeinberger’s—
no, Weinberger’s—“Schwanda
the Bagpipe-player.”
Erna Berger.
In her first Melbourne con-
cert Erna Berger was heard only
in “wordless singing.” As one
instrument in an orchestra of 80
she gave a staggering demon-
stration of her technical re-
sources. In subsequent solo con-
certs at the Town Hall she
showed her paces in the
emotional field and did it over
a wide range of compositions.
Starting off with the “Exsul-
tate lubilate” of Mozart, sung
flawlessly and sweetly and with
a constant smile in the lovely
“Alleluia,” she passed on to
Schubert’s “Heiden Roslein,”
handled with delicacy and
obvious pleasure; “Du Bist
di Ruh,” slow in tempo but with
increasing feeling; the “Ave
Maria,” in which the rich and
subdued piano work of Henri
Penn blending with the magnifi-
cent mellow voice of the Berlin
soprano momentarily turned the
Town Hall into a cathedral;

Mr. Chifley would agree that the
most inappropriately named horse
seen at Canterbury on Referendum
Day was Dinna Say No.
One person who must welcome the
many special-weight events introduced
by the S.T.C. is the club’s handicapper
lan Peaks; they’ve lessened his labor
by about 50 per cent. Of the eight
races at Canterbury, three were Mixed
Stakes and another a fixed-weight
Maiden Stakes for three- and four-
year-olds, with the youngsters carry-
ing Bst., the others 8.8, and the
gentler sex receiving a 31b. allowance.
Though sometimes criticised for over-
doing it, the S.T.C. really does a good
job in fulfilling its natural function
of catering largely for the poorer-
class animals, many of whom would
be lucky to get a start, let alone a
look-in, at Randwick. On the other
side of it, the club’s £BOOO double to
be run at Rosehill in July should
add a bit of class to the usually de-
pressing scene of winter racing in
Sydney.
Of the various special-weight win-
ners on Saturday, the most im-
pressive was Snow Star (W. Cook), a
particularly handsome grey colt, hav-
ing only his third start in a race,
running greenly, yet fighting on very
gamely, when seemingly beaten, to
down Jannock (a coming winner) and
Dalston in The first Ashbury Mixed
Stakes (6f.). All three were, as
maidens, on the 7.7 mark, and
they provided a fine finish, with only
a neck and a half-head in it.
Snow Star is by the imported stal-
lion Rogerstone Castle, few of whose
get have raced here as yet. Standing
at H. G. Raymond’s St. Albans Stud
(Vic.), Rogerstone Castle is a grey
horse, tracing back through his sire,
the 2000 Guineas’ winner Mr. Jinks,
to The Tetrarch.
The second Ashbury Mixed went
to the Beau Vite gelding Zipper (N.
Sellwood), with the speedy Cognac
second and University third. Yam-
boon, a. three-year-old full-brother to
Katanga, finished very generously to
defeat Chessman and Rockfellow in
the Maiden Stakes. The Campsie
Mixed Stakes (Ilf.) saw Hemi-
sphere (J. Thompson) just shade Our
Bill and Barita ; slightly different
tactics might have won the race for
Our Bill.
The Flying Handicap produced a
sensational, and very nearly tragic,
finish. Nearing the post, Puffham
(G. Moore), up with the leaders, sud-
denly crashed fair in the path of the
oncoming field. Most avoided him,
but Granite (D. Weir), trying to jump
over, stumbled and dislodged his rider.
For a while it looked very nasty, both
fallen riders having obviously been
kicked around by following horses;
fortunately they got off lightly, Weir
with a bad shaking and Moore with
a broken collar-bone. Puffham had to
be destroyed, and it seemed unfortu-
nate that this should ' not have been
done on the spot, instead of having
the game old galloper led away out of
sight when he was obviously suffer-
ing greatly, and a hopeless case.
Meanwhile the scrambling finish
had resulted in the nearest to a triple
deadheat seen since the camera has
been in operation. The repeatedly
disappointing Star Vite, receiving a
71b. allowance for R. Selkrig, won by
a half-head, with Glencrag and Mir-
rigen deadheating for second. Dough-
nut finished close up, suggesting that
he is ripe for a win over a longer trip.
Following on the good form he
showed in the Newcastle Cup, Rifle
was a convincing winner of the Can-
terbury Park Handicap (Ilf.). Roa-
tom made most of the running
and beat all but the winner. Very
partial to Canterbury, Rifle is a six-
year-old son of the Victoria Derby-
winner Hua. Topweight Codicil, re-
ceiving a 71b. allowance for appren-
tice R. Coles, was favorite for the
Handicap, but managed only a dis-
tant fourth.
By far the easiest winner of the day
was Cumnock, donkey-licking Nessus,
Young Douglas and others in the six-
furlongs Two-year-old Handicap ana
giving J. Thompson the first leg
his customary double. In f ro . nt fro ™
the outset Cumnock cleared right out
in the straight to win officially oy
10 lengths. Cumnock had had only
one previous start, returning a similar
performance at a provincial meeting.
Disappointment of the race was
favorite High Planet, making a
thoroughly poor showing.
The ninc-furlongs Welter was won
quite comfortably by Skilled (K.
Barratt) with Alkestu second, but the
camera couldn’t separate Parfait and
Drummer Boy, who split third money.
* * * *
At Mentone on Saturday some 40
points of moistness descended during
the morning, stewards examined the
track a little before midday, declared
it unsafe and the meeting was aban-
doned. The fair number who paid
their admission, which was, of course,
refunded, had probably their last look
at the course. The Government has
decided that there are too many clubs
and too many courses in Melbourne,
both are to be reduced to four, and
Mentone and Epsom are to be used
for training purposes only.

As a first move in an antbdoping
campaign, the A.J.C. some time back
appointed Miss J. Kimble as its
Analyst, provided her with a labora-
tory and packed her off to study over-
seas methods. Since her return, the
club has made a regular practice ot
testing a couple of horses, chosen
more or less at random, at each of its
meetings. Last week stewards con-
ducted an inquiry, following Miss
Kimble’s report that a swab taken
from Frontal Attack at Randwick on
May 8 had shown traces of a drug.
The horse had started favorite and
run a very close third. The outcome
ot the inquiry was that the horse and
his trainer, R. Denham, have been dis-
qualified for life. Concerning the
owner, H. J. Cooney, stewards pre-
pared a report for the consideration
of the committee.
New Zealand-bred Frontal Attack
must be something of a hoodoo horse.
He was originally owned by Alex.
Higgins, leading trainer in India until
disqualified by the Bombay Turf
Club. The horse was then bought
by one G. Frank, subsequently
warned off by the A.J.C. With the
A.J.C.’s approval, Frontal Attack was
then purchased by Cooney, making
his first venture as an owner.
* * * *
The Irish gelding Spam, which was
out here a year or so back and was
absurdly boomed to near-favoritism
for the Melbourne Cup, recently
plodded his way to victory in a three-
miles hurdle race at Cheltenham
(Eng.). That’s his right element.

Members of the field-events section
of the Olympics team had a final
workout at Sydney University Oval
on Saturday; they leave by ’plane on
June 19. Morris Curotta was the out-
standing performer, covering 400
metres in 47sec., to set a new Austra-
lian record. The previous record was
47£sec. set at the 1938 Empire Games.
The best recorded anywhere in the
world this year is Jamaican Herb
McKenley’s 46.95ec., and Curotta
might have bettered that, but for in-
dulging in some backchat with
an over-enthusiastic spectator (his
brother) nearing the finish.

The Australians in England:
Usually regarded as something of a
preliminary Test gallop, the match v.
M.C.Q. at Lord’s did nothing to ease
the miseries of English selectors; the
tourists won by an innings and 158
runs. It was the eighth success in a
row —seventh with an innings to spare
—and bettered the efforts of any of
the 18 Australian teams that had pre-
viously toured England.
Typical Manchester weather washed
out the first day’s play v. Lancashire
at Old Trafford. When it eased on
the second day the Australians, sent
in on the damaged pitch, again
showed that “stickies” are their weak-
ness. They were out for 204, their
second-lowest of the tour, the other
being 101 (also on a wet wicket)
against Yorkshire, Lancashire started
well with four down for 129, but were
all out for 182. At stumps on the
final day, the tourists, enjoying
improved conditions, had lost four
wickets for 259. Out of the draw
was born a hero, and a ray of hope
“Was that you whistling , Joe?"
for England, in 19-year-old Malcolm
Hilton, who got Bradman for 11 in
the first innings and 43 in the second.
On the beautiful Trent Bridge
.Ground, where the first Test will be
played on June 10, Nottinghamshire
made a poor start against the tourists,
being out for 179 in a little over three
hours; “sundries” was one of their
best men, contributing 27. Bowling
for the first time at something like
top speed (and on Larwood’s home
ground, too) Lindwall took six for 14
in 15 overs.
* * * *
As it was reported in the financial
columns of London “Times”: “Mr.
Don Bradman had luncheon with the
Council of the Stock Exchange yes-
terday, and visited the floor of the
‘House.’ Dealings were suspended
temporarily while a mock game of
cricket was played (with paper balls).”
The V.F.L. position has sorted itself
out somewhat, with Fitzroy, six wins
and a loss, on top, Essendon, Mel-
bourne and Footscray in the four, and
Collingwood and Richmond hanging
round ahead of the lower orders. St.
Kilda has lost all seven games it has
played. On Saturday it was more
like water-polo, and Melbourne
skidded and splashed to a 15.12-7.9
win over Carlton; Fitzroy smothered
North Melbourne with mud and
points, 9.20-7.8; Footscray slithered'
over “Sowth,” 8.12-3.10; Richmond
"“Tigers” turned otters and downed
Hawthorn, 12.14-9.11; Collingwood
kept play in the shallows and wal-
loped St. Kilda, 10.18-4.12; and Gee-
long swam up to Essendon, were
down 5.3 to 1.3 in the first lap, then
dived deep, astonishing the ’Dons and
themselves by winning 14.15-12.11.
* * * *
In Union, Manly downed Randwick
27-11, by depriving the Randwick
backs of the ball and tackling wingers
Slattery and Martin determinedly
when they did get it, while on the
offensive side Barry, Walker and the
two Davises combined smoothly.
Clarrie Davis, on the wing, scored
three tries.
East beat Parramatta 14-6, despite
the good hooking of Wallaby Kearney
for Parramatta. McLellan, centre,
was outstanding for the victors. St.
George snatched victory from North,
19-16, in a last quarter-hour; Drum-
moyne beat University, 21-12, also in
a determined finish; and in a very
poor game West and Eastwood fin-
ished 8-all.
♦ * * *
Flyweights Jimmy Hogg and Theo
Green, each weighing Bst., furnished
a very fast fight at Leichhardt, but
Hogg’s greater experience was too
much for Green. Green, a nephew
of Australia’s former bantam and
featherweight champion Jackie Green,
attacked at all times, and his double-
barrelled body batteries often pro-
pelled Hogg all round the ring. How-
ever, Hogg’s right to the chin in
round five nearly settled the issue, and
Green’s left eye was so badly swollen
at end of round six that referee Art
Mawson declared Hogg winner on a
technical knockout.

Make Way For Enterprise!
There is a widespread feeling
among the community that Aus-
tralia at the present time “isn’t
trying” in the matter of achiev-
ing the maximum of production
and prosperity, as well as
national advancement. There
are too many “controls,” too
much political manoeuvring, too
much trade-union interference in
government, too much Com-
munist treachery in trade-
unionism, too much taxation for
production incentives to be keen,
too many shortages that tend to
create other shortages, and far
too little economic co-operation
between the various sections of
the community. An excess of
paper-money in circulation is
also partly responsible for the
lazy momentum of post-war pro-
duction.
There is little question that
the ascendancy of the “Labor”
Government in the national
political field during and since
the war has been largely respon-
sible for this derangement of the
economy and breakdown in out-
put. There has been a swing to
the Left, and a preoccupation
with the “class war” and with
Socialist “ideals” of easy living
which, however impractical or
otherwise they may have been
at the start, have been grossly
corrupted by Communist influ-
ence and militant trade-
unionism.
Whatever form social security
may be going to take in this
country in the future, and what-
ever the level of wages is going
to be, any new milestone in
social betterment that may have
been reached, on paper, by
“Labor”-Government action will
be maintained only by far
greater production by the com-
munity as a whole. And there
seems to be no doubt at this
juncture that the productive
forces of the country can only
be restored to an efficient and
maximum condition by the re-
introduction of vigorous private
enterprise, unfettered except as
regards major national policy.
Socialism this country does
not want —absolutely obvious
from Saturday’s vote. We should
play round with socialistic
theories no longer. We have had
a too-long period of experimen-
tation in socialism in which there
has been no real betterment of
the conditions of the community
—only more foolish idleness,
more fictitious money-creation, a
greater spread of incomes, per-
haps, but a general decline in
living standards.
The Chifley Government has
had many indications from the
people over the past year that
they have had enough of Can-
berra Socialism. The people
don’t want the nationalisation of
the trading banks. They have
almost furiously rejected the
idea of permanent control of
prices by the Canberra bureau-
crats. Only where there has been
offered a definite material re-
ward, possibly of vanishing
character, has there been any
tendency on the part of the com-
munity to support the Govern-
ment, and then it may have been
only a shortsighted section that
has responded.
The Government has relied on
a payroll form of “full employ-
ment,” upon social - security
schemes, upon higher money-
wages, upon a shorter working
week and the like as bait to
influence the people in approving
a scheme of socialism for Aus-
tralia. There has been a great
inflation in the number of Com-
monwealth civil servants “em-
ployed” by the Government, in-
volving a waste of manpower to
begin with and an obstruction
to private enterprise through the
greater exercise of “controls” by
Commonwealth bureaucrats.
There has been a huge waste
of manpower under the Chifiey
regime, a great reduction
in working hours, an infla-
tionary rise in money-wages
and a disastrous fall in output
per man-hour. Socialistic experi-
ment has been largely to blame
“I can't afford to throw it away, darling , at two-and-six
an ounce.”
for this, especially as socialism
has been accompanied by the
evils of trade-union indiscipline
made into a major problem by
deliberate Communist treachery
against the community.
No wonder the people appear
to be “not trying.” Private enter-
prise, to which we obviously
must turn again for the indus-
trial rehabilitation of the
country, has been hindered and
discouraged for the past six
years’. The attitude of the in-
dustrial saboteurs, of the natur-
ally lazy and the avaricious,
has stood in the way of the best
and most encouraging organisa-
tion of the brains and the
energies of the community.
As Saturday’s huge vote in
rejection of Socialism clearly
indicates, the whole people must
now set a course towards the
maximum and most efficient pro-
duction, making full use of the
improved industrial techniques
that should have been developed
since war started, with the wage-
earners of the community being
rewarded according to the in-
crease in output per man-hour,
and with the proprietary and
managerial side of industry shar-
ing in prosperity in that smaller
proportion that was usual
even in the days before 1939.
But competition, volume of pro-
duction, etc., should be the con-
trolling factor in business earn-
ings, not arbitrary and unfair
price-controls and penalty taxa-
tion. It would seem that wage-
earners, having been granted a
40-hour week, will have to be
content with what they’ve got in
the way of money-wages and
similar “improved conditions”
until industry, by increased pro-
duction, is able to back up those
paper - money “improvements”
with something real.
The swing must now be to-
wards private enterprise as the
employment-giver and produc-
tive mechanism of the com-
munity. What good may have
been achieved, on paper, in the
way of social progress should
be allowed to stand on the
statute-book where wage-earner;?
are prepared to work in support
of their improved conditions.
The workers have more say in
the government of the country
than they have ever had, and
they must awake to a realisation
of their productive responsibility.
But it is best that natural
economic forces be allowed to’
reign again in industry, and
that private enterprise be per-
mitted to exercise its powers of
discipline in industry, just the
same as trade-unionism has been
able to exercise its offsetting
powers for years past. Full em-
ployment is not achieved by put-
ting out-of-works on a Govern-
ment payroll. Each “employed”
person must be productively
occupied for the country to
function properly. And no good
is achieved by giving Canberra
ownership or control of vital in-
dustries when the only art Can-
berra understands is that of poli-
tics, its only technique that of
red-tape.
It is to be hoped that, in the
way of social security, Austra-
lians over the past decade have
nominally gained something.
But that nominal gain plainly
can bnly be converted to reality
by restoring full initiative and
incentive to private eriterprise.

FROM DAKAR TO LINGAYE
The Story of H.M.A.S. Australia
By "MACNELL"
The Washington Naval Treaty
was responsible for the dismant-
ling and sinking off Sydney
Heads of the R.A.N.’s only
battlecruiser, H.M.A.S. Aus-
tralia, in April, 1924; and the
Navy then found its ships in
;ommission reduced from 25 to
13. The Naval Board, faced
with the obsolescence of most
of its cruisers, decided to buy
from Britain two cruisers of
10,000 tons each, the maximum
allowed by the Treaty. As a
result, Australia and Canberra,
heavy cruisers which were to do
outstanding work in the coming
war, were commissioned in
England in 1928.
Australia was a powerful ship,
designed for long - distance
convoy escorting. Her eight Sin.
guns, with a range of 14 miles
and a broadside weighing nearly
a ton, were a match for anything
but the heaviest warships, and
bet 32 knots allowed a rapid
change of position to meet a
raider threat.
Her peace-time duties followed
the usual pattern—New Guinea
and Singapore in winter, Hobart
and New Zealand in summer.
Wherever she berthed, with the
White Ensign aft and the Com-
monwealth Jack forrard, she was
Australia’s seagoing ambas-
sador.
There is a naval saying that
a ship is judged by the smartness
of her boats ; she is judged not
less by her company’s prowess
ai sports. In the Mediterranean
in 1935, just before the Abys-
sinian war, Australia, sole repre-
sentative of her country, in a
Fleet regatta challenged and
beat the boats of the entire Medi-
terranean Fleet. The next re-
gatta, for the first time in re-
corded history, she did it again.
She was at the end of ex-
change duties with cruiser
Sussex then—from earliest days
the R.A.N. has been an integral
part of the Royal Navy, ex-
changing men and ships so that
both forces have always worked
in closest collaboration—and
shortly after winning her second
regatta, Australia, in company
with cruiser Sydney, left Alex-
andria for home.
The value of exchange duties
was to be demonstrated a short
two years later. Prior to Japan’s
entry into the war all but one
of our major war vessels were
to serve with the Royal Navy in
widely-separated oceans, arid
they slipped into the British fight-
ing units easily and efficiently.
With war, one of the earliest
actions of the Government was
to place its naval forces at
Britain s disposal; and by June,
1940, after convoying the Sixth
and Seventh Divisions across the
Indian Ocean, Australia, under
command of Captain R. R.
Stewart, R.N., was operating in
the Atlantic with powerful
British forces.
Her first major operation, after
patrolling as far north as Nor-
way, began at misty dawn on
Monday, September 23, 1940,
when three groups of the British
Atlantic Fleet, including battle-
ships Barham and Resolution,
aircraft-carrier Ark Royal, four
cruisers and 10 Fleet destroyers,
rendezvoused off Dakar. The
object of “Operation Menace”
was to install General de Gaulle
and a Free French force and
evict the pro-German Govern-
ment, thereby preventing a pos-
sible future occupation by Ger-
man forces.
Free French pilots in two
Luciola aircraft took off from
Ark Royal for Wakam aero-
drome, their purpose to win-over
the local Air Force. They had
as little success as the emissary
who approached the harbor
boom in a motor-boat and drew
the damaging fire of shore bat-
teries.
Meanwhile Vichy naval forces
were sighted preparing to leave
harbor. The defenders meant
to fight; and Vice-Admiral Cun-
ningham, R.N., decided that the
situation required that British
ships close and engage. At 1000
(10 a.m.) the Fleet altered course
to close the land.
With Fort Goree on its cliffy
headland rising into prominence
and the sand-barred harbor en-
trance in view, Australia sighted
a group of Fantasque-class de-
stroyers slipping northward.
The cruiser at once disengaged
station and stood at high speed
towards them. She flew the in-
ternational signal: “Return to
harbor,” and flashed in French:
“Return to port. If you do not
I will open fire.” This per-
suader was emphasised by a 4in.
shot across their bows.
While the chase was on Aus-
tralia was the target for every
shore battery in range, possibly
attracted by the huge Common-
wealth blue ensign whipping
from her main truck. Their fire
was'bad.
The cruiser’s bulk and waiting
turrets were too much for the
destroyers, which turned for
home. Australia resumed station
on the Battle Fleet.
Cunningham was reluctant to
open with his main armament,
as such action would alienate
whatever sympathy with De
Gaulle might exist ashore. But
with destroyer Foresight, screen-
ing to port of the battle line, hit
by shore batteries, and 8-incher
Cumberland collecting a salvo
in her engine-room that left her
one engine and auxiliary steering
from aft, his patience was giving
out. At 1608 another destroyer
was sighted clearing harbor to
the northward ; the Admiral sig-
nalled Australia to attack.
There were no polite pre-
liminaries. At 1624 the cruiser
had her target in her range-
finders, the cocked snouts of her
high-velocity guns sniffing across
the water,
A score of glasses waited. The
first broadside fell short, the
second right and the third blew
the enemy’s mast and half her
bridge over the side. She was
firing back, guns and torpedoes.
Before Australia’s smojce had
blown astern, the transmitting
station had allowed for the
enemy’s course alteration, the
distance run during the opening
broadsides and wind-resistance
to the shells. The next triple
salvo crashed. Its first shots were
over; the remainder fell in a
smother of steel and bursting
explosive along the destroyer’s
length. Captain Stewart ceased
fire, leaving a British destroyer
to take the Frenchman’s sur-,
render.
It was apparent that opera-
tions would be extended, and to
ensure sea-room for the night
Cunningham reformed all ships
and withdrew seaward.
At 0910 next day, Tuesday,
ships were informed that the
Admiral would attack with
Group Three (the battleships).
Fleet Bombardment
A battleship’s broadside is a
fearsome thing: nearly eight
tons of armor-capped metal
hurled at a velocity of 2000 ft.
per second. On the bridge the
gun-blast explodes in a yellow
flash. The blast flaps trouser-legs
and clutches hair with an un-
seen hand, crashing against ear-
drums with a physical pain. A
big puff of brindle smoke spits
at the sky. Quickly the muzzles
lower to the loading angle, emit
a reptilian hiss as compressed
air blows out burning residue,
and then spout a dirty grey
cloud of gas.
Up and down the great ships
steamed, a chain of eruptions
pacing them ashore. Australia
was firing, too, at merchant ship-
ping and an enemy cruiser under
way in the harbor. Visibility
was bad, and the enemy ships
merged with their land back-
ground, so that the bombard-
ment was directed mainly at an-
swering gun flashes.
For an hour it went on, then
surface fire lifted and Ark
(Continued on page 35.)


ABORICINLITIES
“Mat’s Mate”: It was a cold dusk and
a heavy rain, and when we sighted the
woolshed and, about a quarter-mile away
over a rise, a homestead light, Mat said
“Come on,” and led the way to the lighted
kitchen. Around the table sat six or
seven people, at its head a man as big as
“ While yer going past , Joe, touch up that
bit we missed."
Mat. “We was wonderin’,” said Mat, “if
we could sleep in your woolshed t’night.
Me mate here has a pretty bad cold.”
“No fear,” said the big man. “Last bloke
I let do that went lightin’ a fire an’ nilly
burned it down.” “We won’t light any
fires,” Mat promised, “It’d only be till
mornin’, on account of me mate’s cold.
If it was a fine night we wouldn’t ask y’.”
We saw sympathy in some of the faces
turned to us, but not in his. “Get t’ hell
out o’ here,” he roared. “I’ve had
enough o’ you loafin’ track blokes
an’ ” We headed into the night
and, half a mile up the road, camped in
a patch of scrub. About two hours later
Mat was yelling and kicking the front
door of that homestead and I was doing
the same at the back. People, dogs and
the big man rushed forth, most of them
in pyjamas. “Hey, mister,” howled Mat.
“Your woolshed! Your woolshed!” The
big man ran forth into the mud and the
wet, wet night and ran madly up the rise,
his people behind him and us following.
“What’s wrong? What’s wrong?” the
leader howled. “Nothin’,” roared Mat,
“we just wanted to tell y’ it wouldn’t burn
on a night like this.” Then we fled into
the darkness.
* * * *
“Trade Wind”: Most South Sea islands
show their jewellery in the front window,
but in some years of wandering Kieta,
in Bougainville, is the loveliest spot I’ve
dropped pick in. We went in to land the
Administrator on an inspection tour. The
sea was as flat as a river, and the gentle
ruffling of the s.-e. trade wrinkled it like
a prune. Across its surface spearheaded
tracks of scores of flying-fish stretched
like miniature arterial roads, leading us
in a narrow throat where densely-green
mountains cooled their heated shoulders
in the water. There was no wind here,
and we passed within stone’s-throw of
the big leaves of palm, pandanus and ban-
yan, hanging shining and still, like leaves
forged of heavy metal. In places on the
hillsides clusters of flowering poin-
settia blazed against the green in drapes
of motionless flame. Through, and the
District Officer’s bungalow edged slowly
into sight from behind a garden that was
a riot pf tropical flowers —reds, blues, yel-
lows and whites, a kaleidoscope of color
patterned on the stretching green. A
cable’s length from where a pier stalked
on spindly legs into the sea the anchor
plunged through blue enamel and laid
its spinal column of chain in full view
along the six-fathom bottom. All day we
explored tide-bared reefs, gorged on fresh
paw-paw, bananas and pines. With the
incoming tide quickening into paws of
water at the reef’s edge and crawling
over thirsty sandbanks, we returned to
the ship. Long veil-like shadows chased
the sunset up the sky, and at the foot
of the darkening hills the semicircle of
beach gleamed faintly, like an illusion.
* * * *,
“Horseless Horseman”: There’s no
doubt about the swimming-power of a
seal. On April 15 last, when the worst
gale in years was experienced at Gabo
lighthouse, we struggled down on foot
from Mallacoota to Bastion Point, oppo-
site Gabo, to view the tremendous surf
running. An awe-insipiring sight it was,
though you couldn’t face the wind with
your eyes open. As the mountainous
walls of green water crashed on the rocks
before dashing up the cliff-side
we noticed fish —a foot long
they seemed, and the shape of
sand-mullet —leaping at times
above the curling crests. Next
we caught sight of a seal in their
'wake. For an hour that seal
played in the breakers, some-
limes in the column of water as
it was about to topple on the
rocks. Then, at the last moment,
with a dart be would turn and
dash seawards to raise his head
casually above water and swal-
low a fish.

“C.E.”: Old man Saunders
was waiting on the
verandah when the district new-
comer sauntered up. “Dry,” he
greeted the young bloke. “Could
do with a shower. Must be three
weeks since the last.” “Yair,”
agreed the other absently. “Got
t’ have rain pretty often round
here,” Saunders went on. “It
don’t soak in much on the
slopes.” The newcomer nodded
disinterestedly. “They tell me
they play football here some-
times,” he mentioned. “Some
seasons,” answered the old
bloke. “Wouldn’t be surprised
if this winter sets in early. Not
that the last was a cold rain,
but the next will be. Don’t
want a downpour, mind y’.
’Bout an inch’d do.” The new-
comer interrupted to wave 'a
hand at the paddock opposite.
“That where they play footy?” he in-
quired. “Needs grading, doesn’t it?”
“Never get a grader on it till it rains,”
Saunders scoffed. “Country’s too dry.
Why, that crop o’ mine’s showin’ it
already. Thought last night we might
get a. shower, till the wind swung
around.” The newcomer turned thought-
fully. “Well, I’d like t’ see them get a
team,” he declared. “Steady drizzle’d
be better,” contradicted the old farmer.
“Aw, y’ mean football. Gripes, that’s the
trouble with you young ’uns nowadays,”
he snorted, “Y’ can’t think of anything
but flamin’ sport.”

“Jurumudi”: I see that, according to
Mr, Ernest Typson, secretary of the
Malayan branch of the British and
Foreign Bible Society, the good book has
replaced beer, and hymnals ousted hang-
overs, amongst North Borneo headhunters,
whose favorite form of entertainment be-
fore Christianity taught them better
things was beer orgies. It used not to be
such a pleasant beverage as beer in my
“I know something about art—used to do a bit of tattooing
days. The Nofth Borneo native, if he is
a man of substance, treasures gusi, large
Chinese jars of ancient lineage for which
he often pays enormous prices. In some
tribes the gusi is used as a burial vault,
and the jar is suspended from the roof of
the communal longhouse with the body
of the deceased inside it. The cadaver
deliquesces, and after a decade or so
there is nothing left but a clear and in-
offensive liquid. On festival occasions
the jar is tapped and the fluid mixed with
toddy, the rice drink with a kick which
makes the Bikini bomb seem like a
cracker. Men, women and children be-
come completely sozzled until the
supply of grandma is exhausted. It is
firmly believed that in imbibing the de-
parted’s essence the tribe acquires his or
her virtues, so the orgies are just as much
religious ceremonies as the missionaries’
hymnals. The substitution of beer for
the ancestral tipple marks a distinct rise
in Bornean civilisation.

“Dong”: That sweeping statement that
the whale’s blubber underwear enables
diim to “withstand the pressure and. in-
tense cold of great depths” (B. 19/5/’4B)
W'ould have scuttled some British scientists
who have just completed a sizable freeze
employed on the most modern whaling
“factory”-ship in the Antarctic. While
they had to examine each whale caught
for migration-markers, their main job
was trying to get a clue on how the whale
can sound so deeply and how he manages
to change pressure so quickly without
developing the “bends.” They may have
struck oil, and if they did Britain is
certain to keep it secret, for it may ex-
plain how to prevent pilots’ “blackouts”
and help to solve the biggest bottleneck
in the supersonic-aircraft business.
* * * *
“Bosun’s Mate”: Tell “Ex-Bluenose”
(B. 19/5/’4B) that whales seldom sound
deeper than 100 fathoms, though they
can stay submerged for nearly 45
minutes. As with a deep-sea diver, water-
pressure forms nitrogen bubbles in the
blood, rapid release of which in a quick
ascent, in the diver’s case, brings on the
dreaded bends. The whale overcomes
this by utilising his muscles —they are a
very deep-red color —as reservoirs of
oxygen, which, while increasing submerg-
ence periods, also retain bubbles and ex-
hausted blood, preventing their access to
the general circulation.

“Blime”; By perseverance and hard
work Mac had carved out a property for
himself, extended it, and just reached the
stage where he needed regular help when
things got tough in the labor line. Un-
daunted, he worked from daylight till
well into the night to keep the place going,
occasionally dashing over to a neighbor
to lend a hand with urgent seasonal work.
It was late shearing-time when another
SOS came from his harassed neighbor,
and, donning shearing clobber, Mac
hurried oyer. Running sweat like a
fountain, and worn with backache, he
was still swinging the machine a week
later when visitors strolled in, and began
yarning. “No, I’d say there’ll be no re-
duction in tax for a long time,” an-
nounced one loudly. “But wages are
good.” * Mac’s knuckles showed white,
and the sweat dripped faster. “Now take
this chap,” continued the visitor, indi-
cating Mac. “He’ll collect over fifty bob
a hundred for this, but they tell me he’ll
pay almost half of it back in tax.” Mac’s
jaw was set tight as he jumped for an-
other woolly. “Y’ know, it wouldn’t sur-
prise me if tax goes up.” The voice was
rambling on when the boss dashed in
from Mac’s let-out pen. He paused to
listen, then turned accusingly to the
visitors. “Hey, you two’ll have t’ talk
about somethin’ else,” he ordered, “or
go outside. Gripes, I don’t want any
more o’ me sheep’s ribs crushed in.”
♦ * * *
“Betcha”: For some years owners in
these parts have been complaining of the
increase in pest grasses. Horehound,
corkscrew, peppercress and others which
once showed only in isolated spots are
now rapidly taking over large areas. The
reason puzzled me till I struck old Bill
on the subject recently. Bill’s near neigh-
bor was holding forth on the menace of
his rampant red grass. “Yair,” nodded
Bill. “I’ve seen that stuff through your
fence, but it don’t come on my side.
Fact, I don’t have none o’ them noxious
weeds an’ things.” I looked at the hat-
racks Bill was droving. “Don’t have
much grass, either, do you. Bill?” I
asked. “Gripes, no,” he replied. “Me
stock watch the ground all the time, an’
soon’s a bit shoots up they grab it.”
“Rabbits?” I queried. “Hundreds of
’em,” he nodded. “They keep me place
bare as a road.” So that’s it. Twenty
years ago there were no weed pests around
here. And 20 years ago this area swarmed
with rabbits. Rabbits that ate every green
thing that showed up. They stripped the
young blackberry plants, climbed the
prickly-box to eat the bark, and nibbled
young horehound and red grass down to
the roots. Rabbits that starved the sheep
and the weeds.
* * * ♦
“Old-timer”: Deep in the scrub east
of Pinnaroo (S.A.) Macginnis was in his
tin shack just about to settle down to tea
when he heard a call. He went to the
door and peered into the night and yelled,
“Wahoo! Who’s that?” Far to the
north a faint voice answered, and Mac-
ginnis’s two dogs rushed madly out of
sight, shrieking challenges. Mac. waited.
Then he yelled again. This time the
voice came from the west. Mac. struck
out, yelling. He heard his dogs some-
where toward the south and then a voice
in the north-east, “Gripes,” Mac. mar-
velled, “I’m ruddy well surrounded.” He
chased that shifting voice all round the
compass for the next half-hour and in
the end managed to capture a lost new-
chum on a weary horse. “The bleedin’
’orse,” panted the newchum, “wouldn’t
go the way I wanted. Proper wooden-
head, he be.” He fell off and stood
stiffly. “Whyinell,” demanded Mac.,
“didn’t y’ jump off an’ walk when y’ saw
me light?” The newchum was horrified.
“Yon’s Mister Urlee’s ’orse,” he said.
“Lent ’un to I to ride into Pinnaroo, ’e
did. ‘Don’t ’ee lose ’un,’ ’e says, an’ I
never. Mister, did I got off ’un I never
’ad got back again.” Mac. started to
laugh—until it dawned on him that he’d
have to catch one of his own horses and
spend half the night leading the new-
chum home. '

“Canina”: If your willpower will let
you part with it this weather, the hot-
waterbottle is the answer to a newly-
acquired puppy’s nocturnal protestations
at having been shanghaied from his
family circle. Fill the bottle with warm
water —don’t use hot, as it will render
him liable to a cold —wrap it in a cloth
in the bottom of his box and he’ll utter
one yelp of appreciation and settle down
for the night. After a couple of days,
when he’ll be used to his new surround-
ings, you may have your bottle back.
The only time I’ve seen the scheme go
haywire was when a pup saw strong re-
semblance in the ancient nobbly water-
bottle to his late mother and commenced
a tentative nibble. A little later he let
out a wail of disillusionment, and after
being wrung out and revived with a sip
of 0.P., firmly took possession of our
only kangaroo rug, a stronghold h? favors
to this day.
A STORY FROM THE PAST.
This is the yarn once told
Of a bullocky of old
Who sat in sullen silence on the road;
And those who passed him by
From him got no reply
As he sat still and brooding by his load.
Bogged axle-deep in clay,
In a disheartening way,
He’d flogged his team until their lazy hides
Were criss-crossed with the cuts
That marked their hides like ruts
And dug a mesh of channels down their sides.
He’d worn his whip to shreds.
Used the handle on their heads,
And once or twice had tried them with his
boot;
But, stubborn as a judge,
They still refused to budge,
And belting them with saplings bore no fruit.
So there in patient state,
Like Job brought up to date,
But heart as cold and hard as granite stone,
He sat without respite
All day and through the night;
Sat there beside his team, aloof, alone.
Sat there beneath the sun,
Until the day was done
And all the stars came out above the team;
Sat while his bullocks lay
Still having their own way
As in a fancy picture or a dream.
By day and starry night
That bullocky sat tight,
As also did his loafing bullocks, too,
Until, on the fifth day,
He suddenly gave way
To shocking bursts of language worse than
blue.
It set alight the scrub, *
Burnt down the nearest pub,
And seared a swagnjan’s hair right off his
head;
Burnt all the fences down,
Threatened the nearest town
And singed the kangaroos before they fled.
Then, so the story goes,
The team were on their toes
And racing down the road like antelopes,
Taking each hill and rise
As fast as swallow flies,
And like a whirlwind shooting down the
slopes.
Thus is the story told:
That bullocky had a cold
And sat in frantic silence on the track
Until he found again
His magic art profane
When like the roar of hell his voice came
back.
VICTORIA.

Employed by
“Billy T.”; Monty has bought a jeep,
and the township has heaved a collective
sigh of relief. Hitherto when his old Chev.
appeared in the main street anyone com-
ing towards him would either pull over
near a tree and stop or shoot up a side
lane; while those behind, far from show-
ing any inclination to overtake the aged
vehicle, would slow down and dawdle
behind until Monty’s route was estab-
lished, In this manner it had been pos-
sible to reduce the risk of disaster, though
the presence of strange drivers often led
to keen speculation as to whether they’d
emerge intact at the other end of the
street. This was not because Monty is a
bad driver —he is a good one —but be-
cause of his conviction that the only
proper place to spit in public is in the
gutter. He is, of course, much too polite
to spit across the vision of a fellow-pas-
senger, so when he feels that expectora-
tion is upon him he swings swiftly across
the road and expels the substance in the
gutter on the wrong side. Despite the
number of times trucks and limousines
have turned catherine-wheels and landed
with their noses stuck in shop doors as a
result of this passion for personal hygiene,
nothing can convince Monty that his
habit has any connection with traffic
rules; hence the unanimous joy over the
fact that now, thanks to left-hand drive,
Monty may spit to his heart’s content
without crossing the road.

“Horseless Horseman”: One of the
worst scares a man can get in the bush
at night is when you’re looking for a set
rabbit-trap and the next thing you know
there’s a rattle, a snarl and something has
gripped you by the leg. A wild domestic
cat, of course, caught in the trap, but it
happens so infrequently that you forget
about the occurrence until the next time,
as I did the other night. As the enraged
outsize in felines clawed violently at my
leg, the lantern went out, and as I moved
back the cat and trap came with me.
Luckily I fluked swiping this furry fury
over the head in the dark with the setter
and escaped the usual severe scratching.
But I couldn’t relight that lantern for
shaking.

“Bo”; It was about four miles from
the township that we struck the bullocky.
His timber-jinker was empty and his
team, still yoked, stood patiently waiting.
The bullocky, his face just lathered —
the brush he had just put down looked
as if its hairs had been supplied from
the tail of one of his team —was standing
directly in front of the near-side leader.
A cut-throat razor was open in his hand.
The conductor of oxen looked at us des-
pairingly. “This adjectival son of a
misbegotten blank,” quoth he, with that
touching affection which man reserves for
the animals of burden which serve him,
“keeps droopin’ his blasted eyelids. How
the hell does he expect a man to shave
himself? C’mon, Baldy, blank you, wake
up! ” —and he applied a gentle persuader
with his boot to the nearest available
piece of oxen-hide. As Baldy’s eyes
turned lugubriously on him his lord took
a swift look at his reflection in the open
orb and then made a swipe down his
face with the blade. “Smashed me
mirror,” he volunteered. “Got to spruce
up a bit to go into town.” From the
burst of beautiful Australianese that fol-
lowed us down the road I gathered that
the mirror had started to blink or that
Baldy wasn’t keeping his head still.

“Shamuseen”; On the evidence of their,
lacklustre eyes I’ve always found it easy
to believe that the fish inhabiting artesian-
“I say, nigger! Tell me if you notice any spoor,”
bore-drains were stone-blind. The old
hands’ contention that the fish arrive via
the bore-casing from the Stygian darkness
of the earth’s interior seemed to corrobo-
rate the theory. However, my belief is
now somewhat shaken as the result of
playing a spotlight on the surface of a
pool at a bore mouth one dark night.
First a few stragglers, then a swarm, nosed
into the lighted circle, clearly indicating
that their eyes were not insensitive to
light. Allowing that they are not blind.
Nature must employ some smart engineers
to evolve a visionary apparatus capable
of adaptation from a subterranean world
of darkness to the lighted surface environ-
ment.

“B. A. Ker”: He was a satirical
humorist who nicknamed ti-tree “mother’s
glory,” for, with the possible exception
of the thick-girthed, red-wooded varieties,
ti-tree is not so hot as fuel —in both
senses. But Empire Day never fails to
awaken in me a nostalgic affection for
the branches and scrub of the maligned
wood. In our barefooted days ironbark
saplings, box-gum, wattle —anything
burnable went into the making of a
“beaut bonfire,” but nothing else turned
the lofty pyre info an immense “flower-
pot,” with sparks cascading to exhilarating
heights, as did a generous topping of ti-
trees. I doubt whether the modern kid
gets as much fun out of his quid’s-worth
of fireworks as we did from a handful
of tom-thumbs, a catherine-wheel (which
always seemed to fall off after the third
gyration), one basket-bomb (invariably
saved till last) and constant replenishings
of ti-tree scrub. Then, after the last twig
had finished flaring, came the potato-
cooking ritual. Nothing in the world
tasted so delectable as the charred, in-
digestible messes of spud we dragged
from the embers. Only once we admitted
to finding them slightly unpalatable; but
it wasn’t until Puddin discovered that
the fire had yielded more Irish apples
than had been thrown in that we began
to wonder. I still remember Dad’s alarm
when he found we’d been eating the
dahlia-bulbs that he had dumped on
the rubbish-heap over which we always
built the annual bonfire.
“King Is.”: It is a long call from
“Mic-O-F.’s” submarine cable laid in
1935 connecting Vic. and The Speck (B.
21/4/’4B) back to the first undersea wire
between those two places. On Sep-
tember 29, 1857, the first tick-tack passed
under Bass Strait, the terminal points be-
ing Melbourne and Hobart. The first
public message covered Hobart produce
prices ; flour £33 per ton, wheat 14s. 9d.
to 15s. per bushel.

“Gravelsnatcher”: A popular former
State Governor, long since returned to the
Old Dart, has lately been giving the Big
State some good publicity. I wonder if
he ever mentions Bill Tree. Bill was
managing a station out from Marble Bar
when the vice-regal party came through,
and a lack of education or knowledge
of the ways of cities didn’t prevent him
from doing the right thing. “Come right
in, your eglegency,” he welcomed the
Governor to his banner-and-bunting-
bedecked bungalow. “Come in an’ meet
the family. This is me missus—she’s
just cooked yer dinner. These Te me
daughters. This ’un’s Emma, she’s be-
spoke. This ’un’s Jane —she ain’t. Now,
wot’ll y’ have? We got gin, w’isky, wine
—anythin’ y’ like ’cept that flamin’ beer
—I can’t stand the stuff.” His “egle-
gency” took a genuine liking to the bush-
man and extended an invitation for
dinner at Government House if Bill ever
came to Perth. Within a year Bill did,
and duly presented himself at the portals.
The lackey at the door, with what he con-
sidered tact, fobbed the old chap off
with the tale that his “eglegency” was
out, but he’d take a message. When the
joke reached the Governor’s ears a very
crestfallen doorman was dispatched to
Bill’s lodgings with an apology and an
invitation to tea. Bill received the mes-
sage when he returned that afternoon
after sampling Perth’s beer, and “the
flamin’ stuff” had got the better of him.
That evening the unbespoke Jane arrived
at Government House with Bill’s regrets
and the written explanation that he had
a “helluva gutzake.” The Governor en-
tertained Jane and sent her back with his
regards and a gravely-worded message—
also written—that he hoped Bill’s gutzake
would respond to treatment.

“The Rabbiter”: Here’s a problem for
the Council. While cleaning out the
homestead spouting on a South Gipps-
land farm we found, in the decomposed
leaves, four young live frogs. The only
scrub, tree or vine was feet away from the
roof ; yellow as butter and about an inch
long in body and legs, those hoppers
didn’t look the tree variety either. Any-
one know how the stragglers got up there
or how they apparently grew up in the
spouting which a score of magpies regard
as their permanent roost?
* * * «
“Anthropo”: A notable thing about
the aboriginal in his primitive state was
the homogeneity of the race. Nowhere
else in the world has there been a people
spread over so vast an area which so
preserved the characteristics common to
all. A native of Sydney Cove differed
in no material respect from one of Port
Phillip, or of Albany, or of the Swan
River, Shark Bay, King Sound, Darwin,
or the Kulkadoons of North Queensland.
All had the same heavy brows, the dark
liquid eyes, the bottle nose, the wide
mouth. Nor did the Aruntas of the
Centre differ other than that they mostly
lacked the physique of the coastal tribes
because of a poorer standard of living. In
the matter of language all the various
tongues and dialects can be traced back
to the same common roots. Thus, as just
one example, the bat used for propelling
the spear was to the tribes of Port Jack-
son the “wo-mera.” To the tribes of the
Swan River it was the “merra.” Similar
gradations of the word “merro” can be
traced right round the continent. In the
matter of beliefs it was considered a
purely local fantasy when Sydney blacks
expressed the idea “black fellow die, jump
up white man.” But the idea was also
held at Port Phillip—Buckley, Australia’s
wild white man, owed his life to the
belief held by the Geelong tribe that he
was the white reincarnation of a recently-
deceased warrior. At Albany and the
Swan the same belief held sway ; in 1839
Lieut. George Grey was somewhat em-
barrassed when an ancient dame of the
York tribe hailed him as her son returned
from the dead, with appropriate kisses
and embraces. In warfare against the
whites it was a common trick to coax a
white, armed with a gun, away to a
lonely spot on the pretext that he would
be doing a great favor to the hungry
blacks by shooting something. Then, just
as soon as he fired, and was for the time
unarmed, he would be killed with spear
and waddy. This trick was recorded in
the 1830’s at places 1000 miles apart—at
Portland (Vic.) and Bunbury (W.A.).
TROUT COUNTRY.
I’m saving up my ration and I’m tuning up the
car,
But getting gear together is the toughest job by
far;
For I’m going back next summer to where
the Micalong
Joins the Goodradigbee with a ripple and a
song.
The brown may lurk in mud-holes but the
rainbow fights the best
With his tail around the current and the rapids
on his breast,
And that’s in broken water where the wild
white horses ride
The mountain creeks and rivers in the heart
of the Divide.
So we’ll hump our drums and travel till the
broken cattle-track
Peters out in rock and gully and there’s neither
house nor shack;
And we’ll leave those blokes with caravans
and fancy camping-gear
To flog the fished-out water that we’re leaving
in the rear.
Oh, where Franklin and Bimberi and the
Gingera look down
On the foaming silver, torrent with its eddies
deep and brown
We’ll be lighting up the campfire and we’ll
wield our slender rods —
Happy, yes, and humble on the threshold of
the gods.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Wool Qualities.
“Mouton”: Statistics show
very plainly that the quality of
Australian wool, especially in
some parts, has deteriorated
tremendously, and the war-time
appraisement scheme is some-
what to blame. The limits set
by the scheme for valuing did
not make much difference in the
value of crossbred and Merino
wool of average quality. Good
medium-type Merino fleece
wool, that is, 64’s, was valued at
about 31|d. limit, while average
crossbred had a limit value of
something like 26jd. As the
crossbred had a much higher
clean-scoured yield it brought
under appraisement, very little
less in the grease than the
Merino, consequently the farmer
preferred to grow crossbreds,
since they produced better
lambs. This was encouraged
by authority because lamb was
urgently needed, while wool was
in surplus supply.
Conditions are different now.
In the auction sales there is a
vast margin in limit values. For
example, 46’s quality is valued
at about 33d., and 64’s Merino
of good type is valued on a limit
exceeding 90d.
This vast margin, if it per-
sists, must have its effect, and
we can expect lesser production
of low-grade wool. It is to be
hoped that this will occur, be-
cause Australia has no serious
competitor in the production of
good Merino wool, though many
countries can, and do, produce
crossbred wool in great quanti-
ties, as they do fat lambs.
We urgently require fat lambs
for export, and the British as
urgently need them. But
the wool industry is worth
much more than the fat lambs,
and there is no reason why the
wool trade should be prostituted
for a trade that will, in the end,
only be secondary to wool,
Southdowns for Lamb.
“Pat O’Day”: On country like
the western slopes of the N.S.W.
southern highlands a fine type
of fat lamb can be grown in a
normal season —the country is
open, well-grassed, fairly cold
in winter and averages 20 to 25
inches of rain. It is generally
considered to be fine-wool coun-
try, but the lamb-breeder can
do well by taking the following
factors into consideration: (a)
Natural winter grasses provide
plentiful and cheap grazing for
the preferred Corriedale-cross
ewes—“cheap” meaning that ex-
pensive supplementary fodder
isn’t necessary if some conserved
fodder is held on the place ; ( b )
the ewes should be carefully
selected, good lamb types, carry-
ing nice comeback fleeces, strong
and mated with British rams,
preferably Southdowns. Given
a fair run the lambing should
run out around the 85 p.c. mark.
One fat-lamb breeder there
intends to use an improved
method in selling his fat lambs.
He bought a line of five-year-
old Corriedale-cross ewes and
mated them for a May lamb-
drop. The lambs will be sold hi
4i months’ time, prior to the
ewe-shearing. This will ensure
that lambs are not separated
from their mothers at any time,
and there will not be the set-
backs of extra yarding, drafting
and shedding. The lambs will
be left with their mothers till
the last minute of loading them
on a motor-truck for dispatch
to a country-town market.
Wool will be the next return
from the ewes. The final pro-
cedure is to join them in Novem-
ber to Southdowns again, when
they will probably command
their purchase price if sold in
lamb, and their condition kept
up-
Sanded Horses.
“Myrrhee”: Test by placing
a shovelful of manure in a
bucket, filling with water and
stirring until the manure is
broken up. Allow it to settle
and slowly pour off the water.
Add more and repeat until all
the manure is poured off. The
sand will remain and a dessert-
spoonful or more will mean
danger. Give the horse a small
bran-mash at morning, midday
and evening. Next morning give
a drench consisting of 11b. of
honey stirred into H pint of
warmed fresh milk. Feed lightly
on damped bran and chaff and
then mix the following powders,
divide the mixture into 12 equal
parts and give one powder in
damped feed morning and
evening for six days: Soda
bicarb. 6oz., sublimated sulphur
6oz,, bitartrate of potash 3oz.,
and powdered nux vomica l|oz.
Horses that have been spelling
for some time on sandy country
should be given a routine test
for sand before being put to
work.
More Beef?
“A g r i c”: A Queensland
cattleman has summed up the
needs of the' industry if more
beef is to be produced. His
formula is (1) reduced taxation,
(2) security of tenure, (3) proper
and sufficient transport, (4) ade-
quate and reliable labor, (5)
eradication of cattle-tick.
Crippling taxation leaves little
or nothing as a reserve against
bad seasons and has robbed the
industry of all incentive to pro-
duce to maximum capacity.
Without security of tenure,
lessees cannot incur expenditure
of large sums on water and other
improvements. As for trans-
portation, 25 years ago a cattle-
man could be certain of rail
transport if the season set in dry
and he wanted to move stock to
agistment country, or for sale,
but-today the Queensland rail-
ways cannot handle all the fat
cattle available. Labor? No
young men are being trained as
successors to stockmen nearing
the allotted span; they can get
their £lO to £3O a week at Mt.
Isa or some similar enterprise,
“Say ‘Moo!”
and the grazing industry is bank-
rupt of labor.
With the wiping out of the
cattle-tick, this cattleman esti-
mates that Queensland herds
could be increased by a million
head. Enough has been learnt of
insecticides to wipe out the tick,
and all that is lacking is the will
to tackle the problem in the right
spirit. Not one of the cattle-
men’s problems is likely to be
solved by politicians unless they
show far more interest in the
industry than they have done.
But until they are solved it is
useless for Ministers to keep
talking about the world’s need
for more beef. Talk may fatten
politicians; it won’t fatten a
steer.
Feeding Dogs.
“Ngaduri”: Concerning feed-
ing of pollard to dogs opinions
vary; some claim that deaths
and/or scouring ensue. Deaths
will follow improper and insuf-
ficient mixing of the mash;
scouring will follow a too-sloppy
mixture. But if mixed properly,
pollard is a good safe carry-
over between rabbit hunts. Pour
about a gallon of hot milk over
an equal part by bulk of
chopped-up mutton-fat. Stir till
-all the fat is melted, and whilst
stirring add the pollard gradu-
ally until the consistency is like
that of thick porridge. A jam-tin
full of pollard for each dog is
fair measure. Make sure all the
lumps are broken up and serve
while hot. Dogs will fatten on
the mixture ; but it is not recom-
mended for the hunting pack or
sheepdogs in hard work un-
less a good quantity of meat and
table scraps is added after the
final mixing.
Don’t throw away rabbit car-
casses when you have more
than the dogs can eat. Hang
them out to dry. Even months
afterwards the dogs will relish
these “dehydrated” rabbits, I
feed my dogs every evening;
but a good feed —as much as
the dog can eat —every two days
is sufficient. If dogs are not in
work, let them have a good run
round night and morning and
feed them on the chain. Young
dogs learn quickly, and if this
procedure is adopted very little
trouble will be experienced with
chain-shy dogs.
Irrigated Lucerne.
“Sundowner”: From trials by
Vic. Department of Agriculture
at Werribee extending over 30
years, it seems that layout for
irrigation by flooding should be
on the border system. Optimum
size of bay depends on soil,
slope, sidefall. At Werribee
bays 10 chains long and half a
chain wide gave good results.
Grading within the bay should
be as nearly perfect as possible
and adequate drainage provided.
After a thorough preparation
of a clean seedbed, sow 81b. to
101b. per acre of good local
lucerne seed of Hunter River
type. Shallow sowing is best;
spring sowing for southern Vic.,
autumn sowing for the north.
Use at least a bag per acre of
super, and topdress annually
with at least a bag per acre.
Watering must be ample. Utilise
the lucerne by cutting for hay,
silage or green stuff rather than
regularly grazing; cut in early
blooming stage after watering.
Lucerne can be very profitable —
up to 6? tons of dried hay per
acre were obtained at Werribee,
about five cuts a year.
Oats for Poultry.
“K.W.R.”: In feeding trials
at Werribee Farm (Vic.) birds
on oats as the sole grain ration
averaged 170 eggs each ; those
receiving wheat, oats and barley
as 2-1-1 laid 157 eggs each;
those on wheat only laid 151
eggs; those on barley alone 144
eggs. Oat-fed birds thus pro-
duced an average of 19 eggs
more than wheat-fed birds.
Because of their husks oats
do not contain the same amount
of nutrients per pound as wheat,
so this deficiency is offset by a
one-sixth increase in the weight
of the grain issue. Oats are
much bulkier than wheat, hence,
when being measured instead of
weighed, almost double measure
must be used to provide nutrient
equivalent of wheat.
From the economic viewpoint,
oats at 4s, 6d. a bushel are as
cheap as bagged wheat at 7s. 9d.,
but only good-quality oats with
a bushel weight of at least 341b.
should be used for poultry-feed-
ing. They can be used as one-
third of the grain ration, while
ground oats represent 40 p.c, of
the mash.
Repairing Cracked Pip«s.
“J.J.A.”: A temporary repair
can be made to a broken or
cracked water-pipe so long as it
is not under too much pressure
by forcing pitch or stiff roofing
tar into the fracture and then
binding with adhesive-tape.
If, however, the pipe carries
high pressures the metal can be
cleaned with a file or emery,
then clean wire wound tightly
and closely around the pipe
covering the crack, and the wire
covered with solder.
For underground pipes which,
because of moist conditions or
cramped quarters, aren’t easy to
get at, a layer of cement around
the cracked portion will cure the
leak.
Cleaning Paint-brushes.
“Bill C.”: Hardened paint-
brushes can be cleaned by boil-
ing in soda solution, but the job
is tedious, and the bristles will

be injured if the solution is
heated beyond 160 deg. F. for
any length of time. Amyl ace-
tate, a liquid much used for dis-
solving celluloid, will speedily
dissolve hard paint or varnish
without harming the brush. It
may then be washed out of the
brush with turpentine, but naked
lights should be kept away from
the amyl acetate.
To soften old paint on timber,
etc., so that it may be scraped
off, swab the surface with a mix-
ture comprising two parts of
liquid ammonia and one part of
turpentine. Repeat if necessary.
Lifting Water.
“Wem”: When it is necessary
to use a centrifugal pump to lift
water more than 10ft., the prob-
lem is that it is practically im-
possible to keep a belt tight
enough to drive such a pump
on a vertical drive, as the
weight of the belting causes
it to leave the lower side of the
pump pulley. To overcome this
will need a counter-shaft across
the top of the well with two idle
or loose pulleys, over which the
belt is passed on its flat and
then as a horizontal drive to
tractor or engine some eight or
10ft. from top of the well. I
have seen such an arrangement
driving a pump over 60ft.
down a well in this manner.
Irrigation.
During the past
few years some Greeks have
taken up small holdings adjacent
to the Queanbeyan and Mo-
longlo Rivers and are now pro-
ducing quantities of excellent
vegetables. They have installed
their own pumping plants, and
the gardens are an education in
the value of the skilful use of
water. Results achieved have
been outstanding, bearing in
mind the modest amount of capi-
tal outlayed, but, of course,
steady and consistent work is a
vital part of the programme.
Irrigation pays, and we must
make more extensive use of the
springs, underground water and
running streams that are avail-
able in Australia if we are to
develop a sound rural economy.
Belt-dressing.
“Radian”; I have used resin
and oil as a belt-dressing (B.
3/3/’48) and don’t hold with it
at ail. Resin is all right in dire
emergency; but it does shorten
the life of a belt. For leather
belts nothing is better than
draught castor-oil warmed to
blood heat and brushed well into
the leather. Don’t run the belt
for a short time after dressing
or it will slip like blazes. Once
the oil has soaked in it will set
up a surface which will last for
months and also prevent the
leather from cracking.
The best dressing I know for
composition belting is scorched
rubber. Take a piece of old
motor tube —not synthetic rub-
ber —hold it in a pair of tongs
or on a piece of wire and set
fire to one edge of it. With the
rubber burning, wipe it evenly
along the belt surface, keeping
the coat as thin as possible and
avoiding lumps. This surface is
durable and does not harm the
belt. Camel-hair belts are best
treated with a trade preparation
especially made for the purpose
and protected by patents.
As for cotton belting the least
said the better. This stuff
changes length with every
change of weather. When
a cotton belt slips, which it most
certainly will, use resin, use any-
thing you can lay your hands
on, it will slip just the same.
Hints for the Farm.
“Horseless Horseman”: Give
the classer a chance at shearing-
time and clean those roof-
windows over the wool-tables.
Glass-stains and crusted bird-
droppings are best removed by
rubbing with a worn penny;
the glass itself is' best cleaned
by washing with a rag and raw
metho,
“Mr.”: Run several deep
furrows at right-angles above
the gullyhead to retard and
diffuse the flow of water, but if
the gully continues to come on,
block it at the farm boundary
by breaking down the end and
sodding the cavity with bags of
good soil in which grass seed
has been mixed. Protect the
sown area from stock until the
grass is well established, and
keep a watch on it to prevent
a future breakaway.
“Wilco”: The loganberry is
suited by Queensland and N. S.
Wales conditions, and will crop
heavily. Plant them 6ft. to 8ft.
apart, against a netting fence
4ft. or 5ft. high, and tie them to
the fence as necessary. The
suckers should be attached in the
same manner. They are pruned
after each crop, the previous
year’s canes which have borne
fruit are cut right out, and the
new shoots allowed to develop.
“W. Court”: French and
butter beans are soon killed by
frost, so in parts of Queensland
where they are sown during the
winter months to escape the
bean-fly they must be above
frost, or be protected from it.
Messmate logs burning to wind-
ward of the patch will smoke
well and stop frost.
“Radian”: When an engine
dies under load and fails to de-
velop full power without appa-
rent reason check the exhaust
system for carbon blockage. A
few days ago a diesel engine had
the driver worried. Fuel system,
compression and timing were all
right; but a check on the ex-
haust revealed a 3in. bore re-
duced to almost lin. by carbon.
With the block cleared it was a
different engine.
“C.A.A.”: Where timber or
furniture has been badly dam-
aged by borers it should be re-
placed. In the case of light in-
festation inject flight holes with
a solution of one part paradi-
chlorbenzene in 10 parts of kero-
sene. A syringe will force the
liquid into the tunnels.
“Bill C.”: Many throw in
bits of corrugated-iron to kill
hydrochloric acid for soldering,
but scrap zinc gives better re-
sults. It can be obtained from
the cells of exhausted torch or
radio B batteries.
“Rad”: When fitting wooden
split-pulleys place a layer of
emery-cloth round the shaft
first, then clamp the pulley
firmly on top. This will usually
eliminate the slip so common to
wooden pulleys.

As Nellie reckons it, “More
than good three mile” along the
beach before the tin is near-full
with its eight- or ten-shillings-
worth. Feeling the wind gusts
strengthening from the south,
and so without much hope get-
ting the line and putting a piece
of new-caught worm on the
hook.
Bell back on the dry sand
helping Leo dig through to the
other side of the earth. Leo
carrying Bell’s fishing line in his
mouth when they set out to
catch up with Nellie, fishing her
way along, going back every
hundred yards or so for the tin ;
keeping an eye on the weather
making up ; looking out from it
to the nothingness of the black
rock Island and along the curve
of the beach to the headland.
Not worrying much about her
Laurie. Expecting to see him
emerge any time from the sea.
The fish, as she’d known, fled
from the bluster and threat of
the southerly weather. Nothing
biting but small trevally. As
Nellie looks on them, feed of
fish for tea and Leo. Not what
a few dozen big black-nose whit-
ing would be. No resemblance
at all, in fact, to a green parasol.
Still the best part of a mile
to the headland when the wind
brings its forerunner shots of
rain from the darkened south.
Bullets of rain that strike on
bare neck and legs. The sea
gusted up in tossing whitecaps.
No sign amongst them of
Laurie. Or out at the Island or
along the beach.
THE tropical storm gathering
heavier violence. The gusts
sweeping the sand into racing
streamers rising low all along
the beach like a driven mist.
Nothing misty about its gritty
cutting at the bare skin. Bell
going along blindly before it.
Leo slinking tail down from its
hard whipping. Nellie with the
square tin acting like a sail on
her shoulder.
The rain pelting down heavy
before they get back to the head-
land. Adding its undertone of
hissing to the wild orchestra of
wind and sea. Making short
work of the sand-mist’s gambols.
Hardening and pitting the beach
underfoot. Pelting bare heads
and backs like driven shot.
In through the rocks to their
dressing place. Calm, even warm
in there out of the wind, though
the rain comes driving still
through the open above.
The tin of seaworms and the
few trevally on top of them
stowed under a ledge, and
Laurie’s clothes with them, they
get out of their wet swimmers.
The rain a fresh shower on their
bodies. Making Bell look like a
plump brown Cupid. Nellie’s
rounded shoulders and breasts
glistening like washed bronze.
Eve, with the daughter the old
chronicler must have clean for-
got. Carved out of the smooth
granite rocks about them. Pieces
from the piles and pillars of
stone going up to the racing grey
roof of cloud.
They put on their scraps and
shapes of coverings ; Nellie her
sandshoes; both of them their
cheap print dresses'. And there
they are as they were. Dressed.
Out on the higher part of the
beach Leo crouching with his
back to the rain still giving him
a whipping. They stand near
him, looking over the savage
waste of sea to the rain-shriven
and surf-shrouded Island.
Nellie a shrivelled hag with
the age of the wind and rain,
twisting and washing her hair
like short tails on her head.
Her bag of a dress sagging down
wet at the back ; blown against
her side by the wind as a shape-
less cloth over her bones. A
bony hand up keeping the rain
out of her eyes. Straining to
stare at the sea’s fight against
the leashes holding it from
bursting up in its' rushing anger
to engulf the world. Bell, cling-
ing on to her other hand, a
whimpering rag of a girl.
Suddenly, as hag Nellie sees
the black mark on the sea,
“Laurie! Him!’’
A wild cry breaking above
even the sea’s and the wind’s
and the rain’s tumult of smash-
ing and shrieking furies. A
cry like a scream in a dead
room. Her hand jerked away
from Bell’s wet paw. Fists
clenched beaten together in a
hag’s tattoo above her head.
“Him ! Him /”
There again he is; coming
over the top of the sea. The
board showing out clear above
it in the white lacing of wave-
crest. Now thrown clean into
the air ; the board standing on
end and falling forward. Down
and lost out of sight.
THE hag has gone from the
high beach. There is no
hag. Nellie is a mad laughing
naiad. She has her breasts
squeezed in her hands. Gripping
something of life, as he is.
Twisted side-on with him by the
wrench of the wave. Out with
him, fighting down its violence.
Defeating it. Riding cloud-high
over it. Spearing down the
steep sides.
She can see his face. Laugh-
ing, with the sea at his will. To
Nellie, part of her. The man
part. Laurie.
She is laughing and crying to-
gether, Tears washing the
lighter rain down her face.
Clapping her hands. As mad as
he is, and the sea. She is life
incarnate, fleeting now down
across the beach to where the
current is taking him clear of
the headland.
She loses sight of him alto-
gether from the lower beach;
but she has no fears whatever.
“He get ashore orright, that
Laurie.”
No laughing mixed with her
crying now. There he is, neck
deep, waist deep, knee deep;
coming ashore. Carrying his
red board. His shoulders and
chest glistening wet iron. One
great arm bent holding the
board like a feather. White
teeth showing in a grin.
No ; no god or kingling of the
sea to Nellie. Not now. Com-
ing up through the wash shout-
ing part-breathless at her. Laugh-
ing at her. Throwing the board
on the beach and bending down
to feel at his bruised knees and
ankles'.
To Nellie, nothing godlike at
all. No. That fair bloody cow
Laurie! Frightening the damn
life out of a woman like that.
She is not Eve tempted by any-
thing so incredible as a fruit on
a tree. She is Nellie tempted by
that great wet apple his broad
rear. She pulls her rag of dress
up. She runs knock-kneed over
and plants a kick on the broad
expanse of it. Stumbling off-
balance, Laurie turns in surprise
and quick anger. Stopping and
drawing back like a dog with a
cornered cat pawing at it.
KJ ELLIE shaking her fist at
i him. The wife of his tent
repeating her wifely chorus:
“You go out to that Island
again! You go out to that Island
again! ” With what would hap-
pen if he did. Words maybe
familiar enough to the Record-
ing Angel, the patient R.A.
Certainly familiar enough to
Laurie. A simple meaning in
them for him. That he’s back
from the Island. Back with
Nellie.
Bell and Leo a whimpering
huddle as the pair of them go
past to the headland. Nellie
getting the tin of seaworms and
fish ; Laurie pulling his flannel
and trousers on over his trunks.
They come out and all go
again up over the sandhills.
Trudging along the lagoon in
dragging single-file in the grey-
clouded light, to the track in
through the ti - trees. Any
Watcher of them free now to
turn elsewhere. Too tired, all
of them, for any words, strong
or otherwise.
They go in at the end of the
track, leaving their heritage-for-
a-day as it was given to them.

The Soviet Enters a Davis
Cup Team.
Moscow’s great Sportsplatzski
Stadium was packed for the tie
between Australia and the
U.S.S.R. Not one seat was
vacant. This was not strange,
as there weren’t any seats.
Only the week before M. Vod-
kavitch, the Commissar for
Forests, had suffered a severe
rush of lead to the head because
of two things: the target set for
hardwood production was two
thousand million super feet be-
hind schedule, and inquiry had
revealed that his nine bank
accounts in various names had
increased in the aggregate over
the past year by one and a half
million roubles, and that this
had coincided with his granting
a syndicate of Latvians permis-
sion to cut out without royalty
four complete State forests. M.
Vodkavitch had made the fatal
mistake of not splitting. There-
after any Soviet citizen found
with a splinter in his finger was
given an extended holiday in
Siberian saltmines for criminal
waste.
An hour before the Aus-
tralian team was due on the
courts a 24-course, meal, com-
plete with vodka for each course
served straight from concrete
bottles, was put on for them with
Joe’s special compliments, ac-
companied by a warning that the
skipping of even one course, or
the toast to Joe that was to go
with each, would be viewed by
the champion of liberty and bul-
wark against oppression as a per-
sonal slight.
The team, though slightly tight
at the belt after it, was still sober
at the finish, though the big
aspidistra in the tub near their
table was starting to hiccup as
they left in the American jeep
specially placed at their disposal.
The political commissar who
escorted them was chagrined to
find that the 40 m.p.h. ride to the
Stadium with elliptical wheels
hadn’t had the slightest effect on
them —after all, how was he to
know that the Australians had
often ridden in Sydney trams?
Play was delayed for an hour
while the great standing con-
course, workers and their guards,
were subjected to an hour’s
tirade by relays of political com-
missars against the filthy war-
mongering plutocracies which
arrogantly sent alleged sporting
teams to defile the Soviet’s
sacred soil and to try to carry
out what they really came for —
to spy on the U.S.S.R. They
got an additional half-hour on
the, matchless standard of living
enjoyed by the happy Soviet
workers as compared with the
slaves in such capitalist countries
as Australia, where they had to
work a 72-hour week and were
shot for absenteeism.
M. Stalin was there —the
whole 28 of him. The umpire,
four line-umpires, two ball-
boys and 21 other officials were
all the image of Joe. The Aussie
team had variously heard that
the Fiihrer was actually in the
crowd, and that he was enjoying
an attack of angina pectoris at
Yalta. Perhaps his loving sub-
jects had also heard the latter
rumor, for no pot-shots were
taken at any of his doubles.
The Soviet team wasn’t the
one originally chosen. Their star
singles-player, Yasilivitch Muk,
with the second singles string had
earlier gone to Stockholm to
play Sweden, accompanied by
the usual two secret police.
There, the team and its guards
saw a gas bath-heater and had
its use explained to them.
"Turn the OTHER handle to get out!"
When, on top of this, they were
allowed to use an electric-toaster
the team, plus its guards, refused
to return to the Workers’
Paradise. The substitute team
comprised two Outer Mon-
golians, the Uzbek champion
and a Georgian, who was de-
grade champion of a Stalingrad
collectivised offal'factory. He
was included as a compliment
to Joe.
As the first Australian player
walked on to the court
an N.K.V.D. man seized
the eight racquets ffom under
his arm and sawed off the
handles, leaving only a two-inch
grip. This, he explained, was
purely a security measure against
the possibility of the handles
being hollow and secreting a
miniature atom bomb to be de-
posited later in the Kremlin.
As the Australian captain hit
his first service attendants on
each side of the net pulled a
rope, causing the net to fly up
about a foot. When his Mon-
golian opponent served they
slackened and dropped it. Every
time the visitor went up for a
■smash several hundred blown-up
paper-bags were burst simul-
taneously.
Despite these and other handi-
caps, such as being permitted to
play only from the end of the
court where he had the sun in
his eyes, and having to make his
shots only on the backhand—
this latter in deference to the
Kremlin—the Australian was

on his own service when M.
Vyshinsky held up his hand and
announced that the Soviet would
apply the veto to further play in
the first singles, and that it would
also claim a forfeit, the Aus-
tralian having played with a
racquet not strung with red gut,
as was prescribed for everyone
playing on sacred Soviet soil.
After having been thoroughly
searched by two N.K.V.D. men
the Australian team manager
was allowed to approach the
Deputy Foreign Minister,
“But this is preposterous!” he
protested. “There are no rules
in the Davis Cup which provide
for a veto.”
M. Vyshinsky frowned. “M.
Stalin makes his own rules!” he
replied sternly. “And, perhaps,”
he added, “teams from the so-
called Democracies would do
less squealing if they were to
absorb some of that true spirit
of sportsmariship that has made
the Soviet Union justly famed! ”

“The Channel Country”
I can confirm what “C. Punch” said
about the “Channel Country” in the s.-w.
corner of Queensland (B. 12/5/’4B}.
I started my working life in 1900 as a
drover’s boy for Kidman in that country,
which I know well. It is difficult for city-
dwelling Australians to understand what
the Georgina, Diamantina and the
Cooper are like. Those rivers do not
flow along in well-defined channels —
they are really a series of waterholes.
They come down when there are big
rains in North Queensland, every three or
four years—we hear a great deal about
the droughts in inland Australia but little
of the compensating floods.
The floods fill the large waterholes,
which may be five miles or more long,
100 yards wide and 50ft. deep. Then the
floods spill out over great blacksoil plains
which may be 20 or more miles wide and
just as long. The floodwater flows on
into more waterholes. Sometimes it
runs out into an overflow lake 10 or 12
miles away from the main flow of water.
These sprawling, sluggish and straggling
rivers flow down for 900 miles into Lake
Eyre, 39ft. below sea-level.
You can ride across those rivers in a
dry time, and hardly know you have
crossed one,' but come back in flood-
time and you’ll wade ankle-deep through
30 miles of water.
To develop, that country we’ll have to
weir those large waterholes —the country
is too flat to dam. Weiring a large water-
hole puts at least another 30ft. or 40ft.
holding capacity on to it. Then with
sprinklers we must irrigate those great
blacksoil plains and grow fodder to
hand-raise cattle. We must open the
channels between the waterholes, and
stop the water running to waste over the
fertile blacksoil plains.
The cattle industry in Australia is as
improvident and wasteful as a blacks’
camp. In Queensland and the N.T. we
allow 50 acres to the beast, but with
irrigation we can fatten four beasts to
the acre. Queensland alone could carry
30,000,000 people.
Perhaps the largest waterhole in
Queensland is big Callidgewarra, which
is right on the edge of the Simpson
desert and at the junction of the Mulligan
and the Georgina. It is 18 miles long,
100 yards wide and 60ft. deep, I have
often mustered cattle around there. A
few miles away is the overflow lake of
Moncconie, from which I have seen
taken after a flood 3000-head of fat
cattle and 600 horses. After a flood
herbage of all kinds springs up. I’ve sat
around the campfire and heard Kidman
bawl “This is the best cattle country in
the world.” He made the basis of his
millions in that country, which has only
Sin. of rain a year. We should be rais-
ing, with irrigation and fodder-fattened
cattle, enough beef to feed the whole of
the British Isles.
From Bourke to Milparinka, over the
Warrego and the Paroo, which in flood-
time run down into the Darling, is also
channel country. Then there is the
Bulloo, which, in flood, spreads out in
the north of N. S. Wales into a great
plain 90 miles long and 15 miles wide.
I was out that way last year. All that
water and flooded country is wasted. I
went with the mailman north of Tiboo-
burra on to the Cooper and saw tons of
water going to waste. At Nappa Merrie
on the lower Cooper the waterhole is
five miles long, 250 yards wide and 60ft.
deep, summer level. These figures are
official. That hole could be weired and
irrigated to support a cluster of families.
It would do our politicians more good
if they rolled up their swags and looked
at the inland instead of tripping over-
seas. — Michael Sawtell (N.S.W.).
Enterprise, Private
How’s this for a bit of private enter-
prise in a country which, according to
Mr. Pollard, will be a socialist Common-
wealth within the next 10 years?
At Wongan Hills, which is part of
W.A.’s dry-farming area, Eric Smart re-
cently seeded 2000 acres within four
days. He used six tractor-combines,
working day and night, with 16 men on
the job at all times. A complete repair
plant to deal with possible breakdowns
stood ready on the edge of the paddock.
Super., seed-wheat and fuel were kept
delivered to just the points required to
minimise delay. For this one 2000-acre
paddock 1000 bags of superphosphate,
24 drums of fuel and 670 bags of seed-
wheat were required. A mobile cooker
with an expert babbler attended to the
feeding of everybody.
All this is only part of Smart’s pro-
gramme. In all he expects to crop
17,000 acres in various parts of W.A.,
using 15,000 bags of super, and 7000 bags
of seed wheat. Last year his organisation
—he is really a sort of collective farmer —
produced 83,000 bags of wheat. This
year he hopes to do even better.
Everything at,the head homestead is
run by electricity. There is good hous-
ing for all employees and good pay.
There are no labor troubles, and Smart
speaks enthusiastically of the co-opera-
tion he receives from all hands.
It’s heartening to realise that despite
salary grabs, ' bank grabs, the gerry-
mandering of the Federal electorate,
monstrous taxation and the threat of
socialism and conscription of labor, there
are still Australians who refuse to be
discouraged.—W. C. C. (W.A.),
Widows’ Pensions
A good deal of publicity is
given to the plight of war widows
suffering from malnutrition and what-
not because of inadequate pensions.
"Going to cook us with garlic! How horrible !”
Without belittling their claims, I’d say
they are fortunate in comparison with
widows whose husbands died from
natural causes —often as a result of over-
strain in civilian life during the war.
Hundreds of young war widows were
able to remain in jobs, even allowing for
breaks when a baby was born. Quite
often these young matrons were living
with parents who were only too happy
to co-operate in the matter of caring for
children while the young mother kept at
her job. I understand that an allowance
of £4 12s, 6d. per week is made in the
case of a war widow with two children.
On the other side of the picture, I
know of a woman who, wishing to be
independent, struggled for years to keep
a family of four. The two elder children
have gone into service and, her own
health being impaired, she had to apply
for a pension. She receives £4 ss. a
fortnight, out of which she has to pay
rent and care for two growing boys.
She now has to sell what few assets
she has accumulated to keep pace with
clothing requirements.
If young matrons who, by their age,
should be in their prime are suffering
malnutrition and want on £4 12s. 6d. a
week, what must be the situation for
those older women who have had to
struggle on alone for years, and now
receive less than half that amount?-
Welfare (Q.).
Selling Stamps
Before our P.M.G. adopts that ex-
cellent suggestion of selling stamps to
dollar areas (B. 12/4/’4B) a few lessons
could be learned from New Zealand,
which has increased its revenue con-
siderably by the sale of stamps.
Since the end of the war, M.L. postal
authorities have issued two special sets.
First, there was the peace series of eight
and, more recently, the four to com-
memorate the centenary of the founding
of Otago province. Both sets had a
remarkable sale, and sound administration
allowed a quick change of cash.
Before the date of issue hundreds of
roneoed slips detailing the price and par-
ticulars of stamps in the set were sent to
many overseas countries noted for their
philatelic interest. This itself brought
heaps of cash into the country.
But these stamps had a ready appeal.
They had something Australia does not
seem to be concerned over. Each was
of two tones which did not clash, and
when pasted together in a stamp-album
gave the collector something to exhibit.
Australia has produced dozens of
special issues in the last two decades, yet
none has been of the two-tone variety.
Each was with one tone and frequently
the set had the same design—a contrast
to M.L., where each was a completely
different scene.
When the designer of the two New
Zealand series endeavored to submit
entries for a recent Australian Set he was
“scrubbed” because he was not an
Aussie.— -Waddlin’ Willie (Vic.),
Trades-Hall Corner
A year ago active boxing trainers in
N.S.W. got together to discuss what could
be done when a lad is injured fighting
and thus prevented from carrying on his
everyday job. They formed what is
known as the “N.S.W. Boxers’ and
Trainers’ Guild,” a non-profit, non-com-
pulsory outfit for the benefit of tem-
porarily-injured pugs.
If a fighter cares to join he pays in
threepence in the pound from his gross
“gate,” with his trainer contributing the
same amount from his “10 per cent.”
When his tough time comes along, the
boxer receives from the guild enough to
tide him over. Several Sydney boxers
are thus benefiting at present.
Executives of the guild, men like Ted
Milmo and Ern McQuillan, know their
cauliflowers and are engaged in training
fighters every day. Recently, however,
from well outside the ropes—in fact,
from as far afield as the Milk and Ice
Carters’ Union, the Chemists’ Union and
the Ironworkers’ Federation—came a
group of high union officials to set up
what is known as the “N.S.W. Boxers’
and Wrestlers’ Association.” They asked
trainers to join and Jack Dunleavy said
he might be interested. He could not turn
up for the first .meeting of the associa-
tion, but found next morning that, al-
though absent, he had been elected
treasurer.
He declined the compliment. The new
treasurer is the Milk and Ice Union’s
Mr. Thompson, who, in the “Tribune”
for May 15, is quoted as speaking on a
deputation his association had sent to
Chief Secretary Baddeley asking for a
Boxing Control Commission. Mr.
Thompson declared:
Mickey Tollis, who was vice-president of
the association, was forced to go to Vic-
toria by those who sought to make him
forsake his union principles.
If there is to be a Boxing Commission
it should be composed of those actively in
the game whose first interest is boxing
and the welfare of fighters, and who
would be more at home in the Stadium
than in the Trades Hall. That seems to
rule out Mr. Thompson.— Plop (N.S.W.).
Recruiting Lilli
- When applications closed on April 30
for the new R.A.N. special-entry cadet
midshipmen only 20 18-year-olders had
applied for the 15 vacancies. A few days
later the Navy rushed into print with a
press statement that “100 inquiries had-
been received for the new entry.”
No reference was made to the poor
response. Applications are still being re-
ceived despite the earlier announcement
that April 30 was the closing date. Little
effort was made to publicise the special-
entry cadet midshipmen. Few knew
about it.
The poor response is a contrast to the
400 who annually seek the 28 vacancies
for the normal cadet entry. But this is
known to all Australia.
Until the Navy reorganises its recruit-
ing and publicity set-up a general im-
provement cannot be expected. As
“Jemac” stated (B. 12/5/’4B) there is
more than ample field to sell the Navy,
and until that is done there will not be
the keen competition there should for a
service offering so much to the adven-
turous Australian youth. —W. J. (Vic.).
“Danger” Money
The quickest way to boost Navy re-
cruiting (B. 12/5/’4B) would be to pay
“danger” money. Diver’s mates on
stranded Reynella—-hands who worked
the air-pump, lowered tools, etc., to the
diver under her hull —were last week
awarded 30s. an hour “danger” money.
A sum of £25,000 has already been paid
to the crew by Conciliation Commissioner
Hamilton Knight. It would take the
naval A.Bs. on frigate Condamine who
manhandled Reynella’s wires, respliced
parted strands and labored to haul her
off on midnight tides just under two
days to earn 30s. The naval pay of two
gunners who attempted salvage before a
diver arrived was Is. 3d. an hour. But
then they only laid T.N.T. beneath the
ship’s hull, one lighting a time-fuse and
scrambling 50ft. up the bow ladder be-
fore the charge exploded.
Reynella ran aground in good weather,
which held until she was off, towed by
the Navy. The fact is that apart from
the diver himself (Jim Johnson, who
recovered Niagara’s gold and patched
Wanganella in Wellington harbor) there
was no danger attached to the x whole
business other than that usually asso-
ciated with serving the sea. —Macnell
(N.S.W.).
The Fighter
The men made Barney a shop-steward
because he was a “good, fighting
unionist.” In the three years he had been
there he had been the prime mover in
four strikes and seven stop-works.
It was undoubtedly through him that the
factory amenities had improved out of
sight.
There were hot and cold showers in tiled
shower-rooms, each worker had a steel
locker, there were bubbler drinking-
fountains, a small cafeteria with modern
electric urns and grillers, tiled lavatories
and a man employed to keep all these
things in good order. “It’s a pleasure
to work in a place like this,” the em-
ployees said.
Barney thought of all this with a sense
of pride as he knocked off work. On the
way home in the train he pondered
over what might still be achieved. Per-
haps the firm could be forced to instal
louvres in the windows or provide a free
issue of toilet soap. He was still think-
ing of this as he left the train and walked
home.
Barney lived in an old terrace house in
an inner suburb. The roof leaked, the
wall-paper was peeling, several stairs
were rotting away. His wife cooked on
a worn-out gas-stove in a six-by-four
kitchen, she did the laundry in a battered
wash-house with cracked tubs and a rusty
copper, she hung the washed clothes in
a yard measuring 25ft. by 12ft. Barney’s
three children played in the street, there
being no room in the yard and lithe in
the house for doing homework.
Home, Barney, “the organiser” and
fighter, settled down to read the paper,
his mind still revolving round the point
of what he could force the boss to do
in JJie way of providing “amenities” for
his fellow-workers. — Old-timer (N.S.W.).
War Gratuity
I got a preview of “nationalised”
finance when I applied for release of my
War Gratuity to buy a pastoral property,
including a house. My reasons met with
the approval of the gratuity officer, but
my financiers, a well-known firm of wool-
brokers and station-agents, did not. The
War Gratuity Act, 1945, stipulates the
“approved institutions” through which
blood money can be paid —banks, insur-
ance companies and building societies.
I pointed out in vain that no building
society wants to finance 12,000 acres.of
cattle country that the woolbrokers are
the logical people to do so, and that they
are authorised by the Federal Govern-
ment to lend money for this purpose at
approved rates of interest. It seems 1
must allow the said Government to keep
on using my few quid at per cent,
until 1951, while I pay 4\ per cent, on
an overdraft. — Faarex (N.S.W.).


“Fruhlingsglaube”; and the light, trip-
ping music of “The Trout,” imparted with
more obvious pleasure and dramatic
facial gestures.
- In the Brahms panel Miss Berger’s
voice ranged from deep feeling to joyous
abandon, and at all times seemed flawless.
But the highlight of the evening was
the hackneyed “Caro Nome” of Verdi,
sung with almost closed lips and-ven-
triloquial effect in one place and with a
skill that made it a new experience for
the most hardened fancier of opera.
"They Walk Alone."
Max Catto’s “They Walk Alone,” at
Sydney Independent, has something of the
grim suggestiveness of “The Lodger.”
Both plots leave the method of murder
to the imagination, which, at the Indepen-
dent, is sufficiently primed by the howling
of a murdered boy’s dog, by the organ-
music preludes to each killing and by
the excellent acting of Lyndall Barbour.
As a religious fanatic who, seduced when
young, uses her attraction for men to
revenge herself, she is the perfect foil
to the sane solidity of Diana Perryman’s
Bess Stanforth, wife of an English farmer.
Some scenes, where the wife confronts
her maid with suspicion of her crimes,
are as taut as a fiddle-string, and when
Trader Faulkner, youngster of the family,
finds the maid in the darkened living-
room and she whispers “Not here —in the
barn” (the scene of her latest murder)
the string almost snaps.
Tom Farley, the farmer, was as solid
as his part, and Shirley Falconer and
Clark Mackay, as the young lovers, held
their end up, though Mackay could have
made more of his first kiss with the maid
—it fixed her character, George Simpson-
Lyttle, as the father, was understandably
harassed by the malign undercurrents
stirring his standard home. The pro-
duction is excellent.
"Under the Counter."
A disturbing feature of Australian
public life today, according to Mr. A. H.
Dennett, Victorian Minister for Agri-
culture, is the tendency of so many people
to belittle men in public life. He was
speaking at the annual dinner of the Vic-
torian Dairy Farmers’ Association, and
the toast was appropriately drunk in milk,
of which there was an abundance at
the dinner.
Quite right. It must be most dishearten-
ing to such men to be made targets for
malicious attacks by that queer element
which seems to consider that nobody
in this country should be successful.
There should be a law about it. If there
were such a thing as justice in the land
Miss Courtneidge would get at least six
months, with or without handcuffs, for
doing just that thing which Mr. Dennett
deplores so much, and doing it at such
a respectable institution as Melbourne
His Majesty’s, And, what’s more, she
does it with an abounding vitality and
unabashed good humor that makes the
offence all the more disturbing. Mr.
Frank S. Tail and Mr. John H. Tail
should get three months as accomplices
and be bound over, and Mr. J. Nevin
Tail (London) should be extradited and
made to stand his trial for having sent the
lady over.
In any decent socialistic country
"“Under the Counter” simply couldn’t
happen. The Politburo would fix that
up inside 10 minutes. Mr, Lloyd Lamble’s
despicable caricature of the Cabinet
Minister who can get anything done if
Miss Courtneidge wants it, and gets her
diplomat-lover transferred from Paris to
London only to find that some under-
strapper in another department has
shifted him to Burma, wouldn’t be per-
mitted. We haven’t got that far in
this country —yet —and only a miserable
fifth of the population are public men
or civil servants,'so the poor chaps will
just have to put up with Miss Courtneidge
until the season closes.
Melbourne Repertory Theatre, at
Middle Park, which is appealing for 1000
fresh subscribers to keep it going, has
been giving its present members good
laughing measure with “Tony Draws a
* Horse,” Lesley Storm’s lightweight
comedy about the three-year-old child
who shocks his father by decorating a
wall with a picture of a horse in full
anatomical detail and causes his mother
to desert her family and go home to her
mother. The scales at the Mint wouldn’t
be upset by the amount of psychology
there is in the opus, but its breezy humor
was breezily put over by Tom Sutterby
as Grandpa Parsons, Edwin H. Dean as
a Bumble with pretensions to the Lord
Mayoralty of London and particularly by
Nancy Fryberg, whose knowledge of
stagecraft made the fuming Mrs. Parsons
the core of the proceedings. Wallace’s
Australian opera “Maritana” will be the
co.’s next production.
Royal’s bombers flew in to attack. The
British line regrouped and withdrew out
of range.
Next morning at 0840 Cunningham in-
formed his ships that on the next run-in
Barham was to engage battleship'
Richelieu (partly hidden behind a sand-
bank in the harbor entrance), Resolution
Fort Goree and Australia enemy
cruisers.
The British Fleet again drove in, this
time sweeping so close that details of
enemy craft were clearly distinguishable,
and altering course together so that con-
centrated broadsides from all units were
delivered at the turning-point.
Dakar harbor wore a mane of smoke
and flying spray. Richelieu and three
Vichy cruisers were returning our fire,
with destroyers dashing across the line
of fire laying smokescreens. Australia
picked a heavy cruiser, . which joined in
willingly. The Frenchman’s splashes were
colored purple, and his first salvo fell
1000 yards short. Australia opened with
a deflection triple salvo at 26,000 yards
(13 miles). Her second salvo fell short,
the next straddled. A pillar of flame
shot from the French cruiser, and her
guns fell silent. A few minutes later, as
Australia heeled on the outward turn,
two 6in. armor-piercing shells exploded
in the engineer’s store and wardroom
galley. Damage was superficial, but
almost immediately afterwards her Wal-
rus plane, which had been spotting fall
of shot, was shot into the sea. Though
her crew bailed out, they were not seen
again.
With the Admiral’s signal “Cruisers
withdraw,” Australia made smoke and
retired.
Meanwhile Richelieu had a huge hole
punched in her bow by a 15in. shell, and
had got home on Resolution. In addi-
tion a submarine had sneaked out at
the height of the action and slipped a
torpedo into Resolution’s belly. She
limped to seaward listing so that the
barrels of her ship-side 6in. batteries
dragged in the water.
The Admiral decided that in the face
of such opposition landing of the five
infantry companies the Fleet carried
would be impossible, and the whole group
withdrew to the south. On Thursday
Barham took Resolution, in tow, and at
seven knots the Fleet set course for
Freetown, arriving at 0800 on Saturday,
September 28, On Monday, Australia,
with Ark Royal and three destroyers, set
sail for England and her Atlantic patrols.
After rescuing nine out of 13 of a
crashed Sunderland’s crew in a full gale
in the north Atlantic—a squadron of
Sunderlands flew over her when she re-
turned to Plymouth in 1945, to show they
still remembered —and having a dud
3000-pounder keep her bare bottom com-
pany in dock in Liverpool, the cruiser
sailed as one of the escort for a South
African convoy. Early in February, 1941,
she rounded the Cape and set course
east for Fremantle.
Australia’s part in the European war
was exercise-stuff compared to what she
was heading for, when, after leave, she
left Sydney for island operations. These
at first embodied patrol and escort work,
and her first major action occurred when,
in company with Hobart and Chicago,
she fought off heavy attacks by land-
based bombers from Rabaul attempting
to clear the way for an invasion group
.headed for Port Moresby during what
came to be known as the Coral Sea
Battle.
Guadalcanal
A few months later, on the night of
August 6, 1942, Australia was heading
for the Solomons in company with U.S.
naval and marine forces. Her command-
ing officer, Captain (now Rear-Admiral)
H. B. Farncomb, told his ship’s company
that the force was to attack and capture
Tulagi and Guadalcanal. Zero hour was
tomorrow’s dawn, Friday.
Australia was guide-ship of the bom-
barding screen escorting the Guadalcanal
transports, with sister-ship Canberra
bound for Tulagi.
A naval bombardment is one of the
most destructive weapons known. Four
Bin. cruisers, firing rapid broadsides, can
rid themselves of 250 rounds every
minute. Using fire-control instruments
that allow for own and enemy speed,
alterations of course, roll of the ship and
even the delay in muscular reaction when
the director-layer’s brain tells him to
press his trigger, weight of fire against
a fixed target ashore is directed with
devastating accuracy.
The Allied cruiser squadrons swung
into line opposite Guadalcanal’s beaches.
Each ship carried her liaison army bom-
bardment officer, who told the gunnery
officer his targets. Twin turrets trained
on the bearing. The only sound was an
order spoken an the bridge, the occa-
sional clang of engine-room telegraphs,
a whir as each turret shrugged after the
changing bearing, and the swish of water
down ships’ sides. Out to seaward the
transports lay waiting. Then, at a given
signal, the whole line let go.
Three broadsides were in the air before
the first one landed in geysers of coral,
sand and smoke. As each target —gun
emplacements, foxholes, ammunition
dumps—was smothered, fire was shifted
with swift facility to the next, until a
writhing pall shot with the flashes of ex-
ploding shells covered the beach. Again
and again the salyoes roared, not the
indeterminate mumble of haphazard
firing, but the timed crash of controlled
broadsides.
Now the landing barges went in, like
tadpoles with white tails moving in per-
fect formation for the beach.
With bridgeheads established, the
enemy’s counter - attack developed—
fighters, bombers and torpedo-bombers
that kept guns’ crews, unshaven and un-
washed, closed-up for days. But, though
Canberra was shelled and torpedoed off
Savo Island, Australia came through un-
touched. *
There followed a series of landings and
bombardments, all much of a pattern—
Arawe, Cape Gloucester, Hollandia, Biak
and Morotai —with a brief visit to Sydney
for leave and replacement of worn gun-
barrels.
With increased A.A. armament and
radar equipment that was to save her
life time and again, Australia steamed
north to be in at the invasion of the
Philippines.
Suicide-bombers
Captain E. F. V. Dechaineux, R.A.N.,
assumed command on March 9, 1944,
and in Hollandia Commodore (now Rear-
Admiral) J. A. Collins relieved Rear-
Admiral V. A. C. Crutchly, V.C., R.N., of
command of the squadron, flying his
flag in Australia.
With the stretching array of the U.S.
Third and Fifth Battle Squadrons, Aus-
tralia opened her bombardment of Leyte
at 0925 on October 20, 1944. A deluge
of shells poured on to the beaches, and
that same morning General MacArthur
landed from U.S. cruiser Nashville.
All day and night the guns were in
action, battleships, cruisers, destroyers
and exploding bombs combining in a
tumult.
Tired, Australia’s men saw the
dawn —and four Jap planes that fell
headlong out of the sky upon them.
The old ship was ready. Pom-pom-
layers rested the bombers in their cross-
wires like flies in a web. Multiple lines
of tracer reached out and nailed them.
H.-e. shells stitched into the planes and
burst in a rippling chain of detonations
that tore them apart. One plane kept
coming. Fire was concentrated on this
target, but, though riddled and torn, the
plane dived on until it struck the foremast
above the director control-tower, explod-
ing in a ball of flame that seared the
bridge. The bomber, still blazing, fell on
top of “B” turret before bouncing into
the sea.
The pilot had done a full job. Com-
modore Collins was seriously injured.
Captain Dechaineux died two hours later,
30 men were killed or later died of in-
juries, apd 61 were wounded.
In a “tarpaulin-muster,” about 600
men of Australia’s company threw in
enough to offer each dead man’s depen-
dants £4O.
At 0730 that morning, when Admiral
Kinkaid boarded the ship to inspect
damage, he ordered her to leave the area.
In company with U.S.S. Honolulu,
escorted by destroyer Warramunga and
three American destroyers, she sailed for
Manus and the U.S. base at Espiritu
Santo. The Americans refitted her with
typical speed and efficiency, and on
December 4 she was back in Manus, her
new commanding officer Captain J. M.
Armstrong, R.A.N. On December 9
Commodore H. B. Farncomb hoisted his
pendant aboard.
Lingayen Operation
End of 1944 found Australia again in
Leyte Gulf, all hands sweating on ammu-
nition, oil and stores. The tempo of the
Allied advance was beating faster, with
bombardments, air attacks and heavily-
supported landings rolling the Jap to
the northern limits of Luzon Island like
toothpaste in a tube. About midnight
she took up station in the vast concourse
of shipping heading for Lingayen Gulf.
These forces, combat and transport, com-
prised six battleships, 10 cruisers, 127
destroyers, 108 assault transports, 166
L.S.Ts. and many more craft of all kinds,
including minesweepers—altogether 833
ships and landing-craft.
In late afternoon of New Year’s Day
the first messengers of a disturbed enemy
appeared. West of San Jose on Panay
Island a single Jap plane broke through
the destroyer screen, zoomed high in the
sky, fell off on one wing and drove
straight as a die into the packed mass
of planes aboard carrier Ommannay Bay.
The lot flamed almost as one, and with
the ship trailing a curtain of flame over
the water she was sunk by torpedo two
hours later.
The day the bombarding-group formed
up off Lingayen’s 15-mile-wide mouth
was one of constant alarms, and Australia
was first hit at dusk. In Sydney her Sin.
guns had been fitted with radar barrage-
directors, which made hits a mathe-
matical certainty. Six Jap bombers came
in low over the sea. The cruiser opened
with Bin., and three planes simply dis-
integrated. Fire was concentrated on
the others, but one got through. There
came a bull-throated roar from a super-
charged engine, and a moth-winged shape
rocketed across her bow. It banked
sharply, roared down and exploded it-
self in the after-funnel. P 2 4in. gun’s
crew were practically wiped out by flame
and bursting ready-use ammunition.
Next day S 2 4in, gun’s crew on the
opposite side was completely wiped out.
Three planes pierced her barrage. One
crashed into the starb’d side, and the 16in.
naval shell it carried gouged a wide hole
in her decks. Again burning petrol
caused most casualties.
On January 7 Australia disengaged
from the bombarding group and steamed
to sea to bury her dead.
Early morning of the Bth brought two
twin-engined bombers from shore. Pom-
poms again got the first, about 50 yards
from the ship. The other plane, though
shot into the sea, skidded in and ex-
ploded against the ship’s side under the
bridge, ripping a 14ft. hole in her plates.
Bulkheads held, and she continued in
action, though with speed reduced to 15
knots and firing her big guns only to
starb’d.
Attacks continued with, undiminished
ferocity, and it seemed not so much a
matter of whether she’d be sunk as just
precisely when. U.S. battleship New
Mexico had her bridge wrecked by a
Kamikaze. The commanding officer and
Lieutenant-General Lumsden, Mr. Chur-
chill’s personal representative with
General MacArthur, were both killed,
while Admiral Fraser, C.-in-C. of the
British Pacific Fleet, narrowly escaped.
The Kamikaze attacks were so severe, bad
weather impeding counter-measures, that
by 1910 (7.10 p.m.) on January 9 the
only undamaged ships in the whole fleet
were Pennsylvania, W§st Virginia, Port-
land and Australian cruiser Shropshire,
though only three craft had been sunk.
Noon of that day, with landing-barges
unloading on the beaches, brought Aus-
tralia two more attacks —her last.
One plane fell on to a gun’s crew,
knocking out the gun and killing all its
crew; the other tried to dive on the
bridge. The pilot missed his aim, just
cleared the port high-angle gunnery-direc-
tor, skimmed under the foreyard, caught
his wing-tip on a mast stay and slewed
into the foremost funnel. Luckily his
bombs failed to explode.
Thus, with Nip planes making pin-
cushions. of her funnels and a good
part of her top-weight blown off, Aus-
tralia withdrew from Lingayen. She was
accompanied by U.S. cruiser Columbia,
herself hit four times by Zombies, and a
flood of commending signals. From
battleship West Virginia: “Commodore
Farncomb. You and your fine ship can
certainly take it. All hands are deserv-
ing of commendation. We are proud to
be associated with you.” Commander
Task Group 77.2: “Your gallant conduct
and that of your ship has been an in-
spiration to all of us. Sorry to lose you.”
The cruiser suffered 113 casualties —44
killed or died of wounds and 69 wounded.
The old ship, with her crew, was over-
due for a rest. She returned to Sydney,
gave leave, and in June, 1945, under the
arrangement whereby Australian dock-
yards were used for urgent repairs to
Allied ships engaged in northern opera-
tions and heavily damaged craft were
sent to England, Australia sailed for
Devonport, to be met there by the squad-
ron of Sunderlands which remembered
her seamanship long years before.
Refitted, guns tested and replaced where
necessary, all the latest modifications of
radar- and gunnery-control instruments
gained through war experience incor-
porated in her hull, she returned to
Sydney in February, 1946, and took up
her duties in the Japanese naval occupa-
tion force. At time of writing, the
gallant old craft, 20 years old, still wears
the flag of her former commodore, now
Rear-Admiral commanding the Australian
Squadron.
