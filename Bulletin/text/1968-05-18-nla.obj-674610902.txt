IS ■ I®;
If you have a worn old roof you
probably don’t dare think about it. Until
there’s a storm in the middle of the
night. Then you worry. But someone’s
found the answer to your problem, with
the most versatile of all metals, Alcoa
aluminium.
It’s'a good-looking, neat-fitting roofing-
tile, called Pgrmatile, made by Hunter
Douglas Ltd.? from Alcoa aluminium.
Permatile roofs come in four smart
colours. Attractive, and resistant to
corrosion and damage, the tiles fit
neatly over the top of your old
corrugated iron, asbestos cement, or
slate roof. This system avoids the mess
normally associated with roof
replacement.
Because they’re made from Alcoa
aluminium these tiles won’t crack, chip
or rust. This roof is only one tenth the
weight of a conventional tile roof and
reflects heat your house will be
cooler in summer, warmer in winter.
Maybe you’re not re-roofing your home.
But you should ask about the
advantages of aluminium in any
building products you plan to use, or
manufacture. Call your nearest Alcoa
regional Sales Office for the facts to
get on top of your building problem.

One more week
1970 AND ALL THAT
SIR ROBERT Helpmann arrived back
in Adelaide last week sounding quite
aggressive. Sir Robert is the director of
the 1970 Adelaide Festival of Arts, and
he quickly took the new Premier, Mr.
Hall, to task for saying that Australian
people had been too preoccupied hack-
ing out an existence in a harsh envir-
onment to think too deeply about cul-
ture. Sir Robert remarked caustically
that Mr. Hall’s thinking was “fifty
years out of date. I thought the pion-
eering days were over. There was more
culture in Australia when I was a boy.
It seems to have got lost on the way.”
Sir Robert was very tight-lipped
about his plans for the 1970 Festival.
He said he has “acts” selected for it,
but that he was a little nervous about
adequate venues. “When the time comes
I shall announce the whole shooting
match, and not before,” he said. As
for the Festival Board of Governors, Sir
Robert proves to be the martinet,
probably to the Board’s considerable
surprise. He announced again that he
would quit as director if there were
too much interference.
THE PRICE TAG
WHETHER or not Sidney Nolan’s
Burke and Wills Leaving Melbourne is
worth the $35,000 art dealer Barry
Stern says he has sold it for or whether
even it is, as Mr. Stern claims, “the
greatest painting produced in Australia
this century” are arguments we will
leave to swim along the sherry at the
next round of gallery openings. What
we wanted to know was: how much did
Nolan originally sell it for? The answer
ca'me from Kym Bonython, in Adelaide,
who sold the painting to Stern for
“considerably less than $35,000.”
Mr. Bonython says he acquired the
painting from Nolan about 1952 for
the equivalent of £100 — although no
money changed hands. “It was like
this: I’d bought one of Nolan’s Central
Australian landscapes and when he had
his first exhibition in London he asked
me if he could borrow it. Somehow
it was sold by mistake, but, as the pur-
chaser was the Tate Gallery, Nolan was
understandably reluctant to ask for it
back. I agreed to let it go so long as
he later replaced it — and that’s how
I became the owner of Burke and Wills
Leaving Melbourne.”
The painting remained in Bonython’s
private collection until he sold it to
Stern late last year to help finance the
new Bonython Art Gallery in Sydney.
About its high-priced resale he says,
“It puts me in a difficult position be-
cause . . . well, frankly, I find it diffi-
cult to believe. The price I sold it
for was the highest I thought it would
bring in my lifetime.”
All of the criticism and speculation
(“Lunacies of the market,” said Patrick
McCaughey in the “Age”) leaves Barry
Stern unmoved, who says his critics
can “go and jump in the lake.” He says,
as a result of the publicity, he has
already sold enough paintings to cover
the cost of the full-page advertisment in
the “Herald” in which he put the paint-
ing on the 'market.
His unnamed purchaser will take
delivery of the Nolan this week, but if
he’s not satisfied Mr. Stern will buy
it back. “All my paintings are sold with
a money-back guarantee,” he says.
WHEN THE PROTEST SAGS
PETE SEEGER didn’t sing his civil-
rights anthem “We Shall Overcome”
at his Melbourne concert this time
round. Nor were any of Bob Dylan’s
angry songs in the program. Instead,
Seeger emphasised love songs and reflec-
tive songs, introducing more quiet
humor thari we yesteryear lefties had
expected. For the messianic figure is
a little older and seems a little sadder.
Pete Seeger ... a Pollyanna?
Perhaps he’s changed because American
protest has changed and made him feel
anachronistic. (He confessed privately
to wondering of late if he’d been a
Pollyanna.)
His songs have been sung by millions,
and armies of protestors have marched
to the rhythm of his strumming. But
“If I Had a Hammer” became a hit
for Trini Lopez and the point was
missed; for all the chorusing of “Blow-
ing in the Wind,” the war in Vietnam
was escalated; and while the theme of
“Where Have All the Flowers Gone”
has been taken up by the flower people,
one suspects that Seeger would have
little sympathy or understanding for a
universal love based on the ingesting of
chemicals.
Nor did his songs save the initiative
of the Civil Rights movement for
Luther King, who’d lost out to the
Stokeley Carmichaels long before his
assassination. It’s hard to think of the
Black Power boys wasting time with
folk-songs.
Seeger has been a sort of singing
Gandhi for two-thirds of his 49 years,
trying through his songs to synthesise
all the good causes into one. All people
of all colors, he argues, are folks just
like us, and to prove it he sings a
sermon made up of songs from a score
of cultures. This combination of dis-
ciplined simplicity and an almost grim
integrity seems absurd and cloying to
many.
The true Seeger is probably a little
of both. He is an intellectual who has
chosen to live innocently, and this is
as incongruous in one sense as a sophis-
ticated painter producing primitives.
But his purpose, he argues, has been
to achieve better contact with his many
audiences through complete clarity. For
many years he’s been an embodiment
of liberal aspirations and his songs have
not only been an expression of
America’s last decades but an influence
on their outcome.
As a concert performer, he is unique.
Not handsome, and no great singer, he
can hold an audience better than any
Dietrich or Garland, without lighting,
make-up, costumes, sets, or orchestra.
Who else can teach 3000 people to sing
a song they’ve never heard before, in
just a few moments a song in French
or Nigerian or Spanish? And having
done so, have them sing descant and
bass as well as the melody?
No two concerts are the same, each
following Seeger’s own mood and that
of his audience. And there’s always
innovation. Before he went on stage in
Melbourne he crossed the road from
his motel to a golf course, where he
picked up a few scraps of polythene
agricultural pipe. Then he rang his tour
promoter, borrowed some tools, and
made some flutes. “I learned how to do
this from a. Jew,” he told the audience,
“who’d learned it from an Arab.”
Ultimately, I suppose, it must be

PHILLIP ADAMS
THEY MADE IT
“JUST TO PROVE it can be done,”
those railway tracklayers, mostly Thurs-
day Islanders, who were expected to
outdo America’s 2.88 miles of track
laid in 11 hours by putting down more
than four miles of the new Mt. New-
man railway track in one day (B., May
4), did it last week. With a machine
developed on the site they put down
896 tons of rails and 19,050 sleepers,
anchored, over 4.35 'miles in one day,
from 6.10 a.m. to 5.50 p.m. Now as
to that question of Aborigines’ laziness
ATMOSPHERIC
IT MAY NOT be in the London
Bridge class, but, in the interests of
music, a Sydney doctor has built an
elaborate piece of instant tradition into
his house on the North Shore. Dr.
Ronald Rivett is harpsichordist for the
Sunningdale Baroque Ensemble of
Castlecrag, a group of musicians who
play medieval and 18th-century music
in a suitably old-world setting.
In order to provide the right
atmosphere for the ensemble’s con-
certs, Dr. Rivett has added to his house
a wing painstakingly constructed to
simulate an 18th-century music room
— with oak panelling shipped from
London, gaslight lamps taken from a
cottage in Hampton, in England, a
chandelier, and candelabras. The room
manages to be in architectural harmony
with the rest of the house because
Dr. Rivett took similar pains over its
construction 12 years ago.
An enthusiast about things Eliza-
bethan, he gave the exterior a Tudor
air; used handmade sandstock bricks
from a Macarthur cottage at Narellan,
sandstone and a portico rescued from
other demolished Colonial buildings,
and stained-glass windows.
“A bit of a hotchpotch, I’m afraid,
but a lot of old English houses are
done in a mixture of styles, too. I cer-
tainly wouldn’t build this way if I
were doing it now, though. Beside the
fact that it’s not a very economic
process, you can’t really justify such
wholesale fakery — despite the fact
that all these high-beamed ceilings have
proved very good in this climate. At
the time, I didn’t like any of the new
houses which were being designed,
whereas I do now.
“We added the extra wing because
we’d been holding concerts in the main
part of the house, and there just wasn’t
enough room. We weren’t going to
make the wing as big as we have,
though — it sort of got out of hand/’
Out of hand or not, its effectiveness
is so dramatic that concert audiences

have admitted to an “other-worldly”
feeling once inside.
Dr. Rivett, bearded and disconcert-
ingly younger than one might expect,
first saw the carved wainscoting set up
in a north-west London antique shop.
It had been taken from a house
demolished in 1956 to make way for
the American Embassy building in
Grosvenor Square. “It’s Louis XVI-style
carving supposedly don'e later.”
The Sunningdale Baroque Ensemble
dates back to 1962, when Dr. Rivett
bought his harpsichord. “I saw them
being made in a factory in London, and
I bought a clavichord, which was all
I could afford at the time. I got the
harpsichord later, then I met Ralph
Edwards, one of the musicians, at a
Recorder Society concert, and we got
together a group. By the end of 1963
we were doing well enough to hold
concerts, and last year we moved into
this room.”
The past, it seems, has a peculiar
potency, for the ensemble’s 1968 sub-
scription series has already been filled
“by a cross-section of people from all
over Sydney.”

A CROWD SCENE
THAT WASN'T IN THE SCRIPT
IT’S James Mason they’ve come to see,
really, acting out the last scenes of the
film “Age of Consent.” But all the
master provides in the way of action
is a couple of atmosphere shots involv-
ing a quiet intellectual sneer into
camera and a shuffle to avoid some-
one. This is taking place in Kym
Bonython’s Art Gallery in Paddington,
which, when opened a few months ago
with a classy black-tie party, provoked
local residents into anti-gallery action:
that is, they lobbed eggs at departing
guests. This time they complain to the
police, well, it’s all that high-voltage
power, see, going into that place for
that film thing, and it’s mucking up our
telly. And we don’t like the noise
they’re 'making, either. “Well, you
can’t blame them,” says Gerald the
security man, “they can’t even see James
Mason.” A small group of women,
however, is having a good try tonight:
they have sneaked through Kym Bony-
thon’s back entrance and are coming
closer to the star. Gerald is obsessed
with the way they’re looking at the
food. He hopes, Gawd he hopes, they
don’t touch it. If there’s one thing he
hates about his job, it’s throwing
people out.
Mr. Mason isn’t quite himself to-
night. He is surrounded by Carmen
curlers, Kleenex, powder, varnish,
ironing-board, and other feminine
paraphernalia, which give a sudden
homely appearance to the gallery hung
with thousands of dollars’ worth of
tapestries. He thinks it’s the flu coming

The leading lady “looking terrible ” and members of cast and crew
on. He would give anything, he cries
with unexpected emotion, anything to
soak for hours in a decent bath. He
tried in that box thing that passes for
a bath at the Town House, with knees
up to chin like this flinging himself
into foetal position impossible. Actu-
ally, this is turning out to be what
Mr. Mason calls his beard year. He’s
got one now, he had one for his last
film, “Mayerling,” and he’s going to
need one for his next, which is Chek-
hov’s something or other. This frantic
demand upon the Mason chin leaves
him unmoved. He raises a bored eye-
brow and, in that surgical voice of his,
says certainly not, it’s not dyed and it
doesn’t itch.
The sliding door opens and in bounces
American actress Peggy Cass, very much
her funny self tonight. In the States
she is a big showbiz name, and all her
friends will just die when they see
“Consent” and hear her 30 words, and
not even in the same scene as James.
But she wanted a holiday and she
wanted to be with that beautiful man,
so here she is, with a broken nose she
got in Tahiti, one day’s work, 200 bucks
a week spending-money, and a woman
out there with orange hair called Hazel
wanting to know if she’d go on her
television show. Say, who is she, and
why is everyone grinning? It is
explained that Hazel Phillips, who is
all black feathers and fur and accom-
panied by producer Judy Petrie, all
see-through white woollen crochet and
diamante, has a lunchtime show. She
was also at Dunk Island with them and
they got to know her well, Mr. Mason
walks gloomily away and says,
“Remember, you came on this trip for
fun, Peggy.”
For Michael Powell, directing the
film, the going is slow, but he’s a bit
reticent about the subject. “Consent”
has already taken more than 40,000
manhonrs to make, what’s another
dozen or so? Producer Michael Pate
wanders around. He has problems, boy,
does he have problems. Stars must be
allowed their little idiosyncracies, sure,
but sometimes it’s more than man can
stand. Jeeze, there’s Mason’s co-star,
Helen Mirren, in a golf cap and jacket,
and underneath that her Chesty Bond
T-shirt inscribed Executive Producer,
“Age of Consent.” A fun idea thought
up by someone for the cast and crew,
but an edict went out that no one
should wear it on arrival at Sydney.
Kinda lowers the tone, said manage-
ment.
And tonight hell, it’s the first big
Press thing they’ve done tonight
Mason’s leading lady turns up looking
ten ..he. A pained look comes into
Michael Pate’s eyes. He would like to
think a star would know how to dress
for an occasion such as this. Miss
Mirren produces a three-inch wad of
pictures taken on Dunk Island. Every-
one crowds round. “Oh, Jeeze,” groans
Mr. Pate, trying to get them on to
Phase II of the evening, into buses and
up the road for a meal and drink,
“Jeeze, now no one’ll move.”
Eventually they turn off the 6500-
wattage lamps, to Kym Bonython’s
relief: his electricity bill is already $l5O
a week, he’s gonna have to charge
people to come here in future. They’re
giving him a mention in the film. Why
not? asks Michael Powell. He deserves
it. And everyone trails off to the pub.
Peggy Cass is howling over the man
who’s furious because his wife has gone

America’s capacity
for renewal
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
WITH THE most open race for the
Presidency within the memory of most
Americans, the United States is again
showing that enormous resilience
which enables it to survive stresses that
would shatter lesser democracies.
What is being debated in America
now is the shape of America’s future
role in the world. That this role may
be determined as much by external
events as by the wishes of Americans
does not lessen the achievement that
this superpower nation, despite mas-
sive demands and tensions, can still
conduct such a complicated public
controversy about what it is supposed
to be and not fall to bits.
It is not just America’s size and
strength that give it this capacity to
renew itself, but some of the spirit of
the place, even some of those things
that Americans themselves, in their
present passion for self-laceration, are
inclined most to criticise. Part of the
reason for this resilience is that very
impulse to do good at which, at times,
we all sneer as if doing bad was a
better ideal. Another part of it is a
toughness, even a violence, that,
although seeming to threaten democ-
racy, may nevertheless be an import-
ant or even necessary part of
democracy’s renewal. With this there
combines an acceptance of the idea of
change that not only distinguishes the
modern world from the traditional
but that also distinguishes America
(and Japan) from the rest of the
world, so that we may have with us
now already the looking-glass-land of
the world’s probable future. And along
with this, and sometimes conflicting
with it, there is the underpinning of
an institutionalisation of the conserva-
tive view of freedom (organisational
order and the rule of law), the liberal
view of freedom (tolerance), and the
libertarian view of freedom (anarchy).
Compare the way in which the
Americans are shifting position on
South-East Asia with the way the
French shifted their position. In the
first place it is worth remembering
that what took the Americans to Viet-
nam was a lot of French dirty wash-
ing. The French had failed in their
short-sighteclness and self-interest: they
were a’colonial power who had made
a mess of /things. What took the
Ameripahs tp Vietnam was not simply
the self-interest and ideological con-
victions that ; saw “world Commun-
ism” as, a global threat to America
but also that' desire to do good on a
grand scale that had already led to
America’s greatest successes the
restoration of prosperity and stability
to Western Europe and to Japan.
When things went bad in Vietnam for
the French, this produced the begin-
nings of an instability that, when
joined -by the agonies of Algeria,
cracked the French political system,
so that the French had to get a new
way of running their country. All that
is going to happen in America is that
there will be a new President.
Even the shift in position on South-
East Asia need not necessarily be as
melodramatic as some critics predict.
A return to “isolationism” is possible,
but unlikely. (Even traditional Ameri-
can isolationism was not a true isola-
tionism but a limit of active concern
to Latin America, the Pacific, and east
Asia: they left the rest to the British.)
What seems almost certain is an aband-
onment of the idea that America can
itself frontally combat an externally
directed insurgency within another
country. But out of the present violence
of debate on this question in America
it is just as likely that there will come

not a flight from responsibility but a
new definition of it.
It is the violence of political debate
in America that sometimes terrifies
democrats of the liberal conservative or
straight liberal kind. The fundamen-
talism of the Right in the early 1950 s
(McCarthyis'm) made liberals for a
while despair of America, just as the
fundamentalism of the anti-Vietnam
movements now makes liberal conserva-
tives despair. Yet in both cases what
seems to happen is a purge of excess,
leading to its exhaustion. The men of
the centre wait their time, then, out
of excess, contrive change. From these
disturbances one learns not that
America is notably fundamentalist
most societies are 'made up largely of
backward-looking conservative forces
but that America can change, and that
it can change in that most painful of
all ways, by affronting established wis-
doms.
Part of the present high tension in
America is that so much change is
happening at once. Both the threat in
Vietnam and the threat to the dollar
are interruptions to the consideration
of the even more fundamental threats
to existing ways involved in the Negro
crisis. Understandably, but unfortun-
ately, the dollar crisis has at present
been “solved” by not thinking about it.
They think about it enough in the
Administration, but both in public de-
bate and in Congress there is a kind
of somnambulism on this question, even
although it already seriously threatens
the future of world trade. It is on mat-
ters connected with the general financial
underpinnings of their material progress
that the American mind is almost uni-
versally conservative.
There see’ms no final doubt that
Americans will “solve” the Negro crisis.
Being what they are, they finally have
no other option. For the second time
in its history, America will then offer
the world a vision of a new kind of
society. But it will not help those
causes of interracial acceptance and
the elevation of the underprivileged
that, along with the developments of
technology and technocracy, seem to be
what humanity’s immediate future is
going to be about if concentration on
the Negro crisis means that America
ceases to play a role in South-East
Asia. Out of the present quest for
national redefinition there may come
a new creative energy that can see the
connections between the two.
As mankind moves toward the year
2000 it would seem obvious enough
that while the world will become smal-
ler, the differences between rich nations
and poor nations will increase; at the
same time others will begin to follow
the lead of the Japanese (although they
will be well behind them) in demon-
strating that prosperity is not just a
Question of race. In these processes
America will remain of supre'me im-
portance. Still likely to be envied by
the nations of Continental Europe, it
might find itself, more and more, fol-
lowing the central streams of history
in the company of Japan.

AUSTRALIA
The back bench revolt:
Build up defence
IN A RARE compliment a Govern-
ment Member said last week that The
Bulletin had done more thinking on
defence matters over the past year than
the whole of the Government. “But,”
he added, “we’re at last trying to right
that.” Indeed, last week saw the level
of argument on defence policy reach
a new intensity, following on from the
empty statement by Defence Minister
Fairhall the previous Thursday. Sens-
ing the dissatisfaction, Prime Minister
Gorton moved with what is as yet
uncharacteristic speed to fight for the
new tack he is trying to get the Gov-
ernment to take.
At Wednesday’s meeting of Govern-
ment Parties he said that the Menzies
concept of forward defence, legitimate
in its day, may have to be abandoned
Chipp—vote now
Turner—crossroads
Jess —no time
Bate—heart says
St. John —survival
Howson—own feet
and that unless Australia could get
iron-clad guarantees from the United
States that it would immediately come
to the assistance of troops in Malaysia
or Singapore in the event of armed
conflict, Australia should not itself be
committed to maintaining troops there.
This was in line with his statement to
the New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr.
Holyoake, that Australia was only com-
mitted to keeping troops in Malaysia
until 1971, though of course it is a
flat contradiction of all the assurances
given by External Affairs Minister Has-
luck on his January visit to Kuala
Lumpur, Singapore, and Djakarta,
when he went out of his way to empha-
sise the irrelevance of the British with-
drawal to Australian action.
In the past the United States has
refused to give anything like the guar-
antee that Mr. Gorton says he wants.
Even in the most confident days of
American South-East Asian policy,
President Johnson’s spokesmen made it
clear that “Commonwealth arrange-
ments” did not involve them. Since
the announced British withdrawal, they
have been equally firm in rejecting any
suggestion that they move in. The
ANZUS Treaty calls for assistance only
in the event of direct threats to partner
countries, and does not bind each to
the other’s treaty arrangements with
third parties.
Johnson’s successor is even less likely
than he to agree to the open and un-
conditional backing of Malaysia-Singa-
pore commitments. Mr. Hasluck, sup-
ported strongly by his Department, is
still fighting to maintain the infantry
battalion in Malaysia and augment it
with the necessary logistics, people, and
equipment which the British currently
supply. Defence Minister Fairhall, once
a supporter of Hasluck in this, appears
recently to have thrown in the sponge.
The Prime Minister seems increasingly
determined to pull out these “garrison
troops,” limiting Australian help to
training, advisers, and equipment. He
speaks of maintaining forces in Austra-
lia which could possibly be flown into
Malaysia when needed.
In the External Affairs Department,
however, they argue that there is a
world of difference between promises
of dispatching troops and in their
physical presence in an Allied country.
As with American and British troops in
West Germany under NATO arrange-
ments, the credibility of any commit-
ments entered into with Malaysia and
Singapore would be vastly greater and
more effective as a force for stability in
the region if the troops stayed there on
the ground. They also argue in Exter-
nal Affairs that nothing would implant
in Asian minds the image of Australia
as an insignificant and impotent force
more than an Australian withdrawal
simultaneously with the British.
But, at this stage at least, it looks as
though Hasluck has been isolated and
that the troops will be brought home.
Within the limits allowed, the defence
establishment is fighting a rearguard
action against this. Speaking at the
Liberal Party’s backbench Defence
Committee, the chairman of the Chiefs
of Staffs Committee, Sir John Wilton,
said that Australia’s strategic planners
would “view with dismay” abandon-
ment of “forward defence” as the guid-
ing policy in Australian defence deci-
sions. He agreed that were the U.S.
to withdraw troops completely from the
mainland of Asia, Australia would be
unwise to keep them there. But he said
it was possible that a withdrawal from
Vietnam might result in an enlarged
American military presence in Thai-
land. The domino theory wasn’t neces-
sarily right. And there was no need to
help it along by an unnecessarily ad-
vanced commitment to pull out our-
selves.
Some Government Members are
working at a semantic device to smooth
politically the abandonment of “for-
ward defence.” They say that “forward
defence” will remain, and that only our
“forward posture” will be abandoned.
They reject the term “Fortress Aus-
tralia” as a description of what they
urge, saying that we would, by acqui-
sition of modern transport planes and
an enlarged airstrike and Naval cap-
acity, be able to exert power in South-
East Asia without having troops on the
ground.
Another group admits frankly that
they believe the only realistic policy is
for Australia to pull in its horns and
limit military policy to defence of Aus-
tralia itself (“Fortress Australia”) and
(somehow or other) “protect” our sea-
lanes to trading partners. This group-
believes in close co-operation with
South Africa. Senator Magnus Cor-
mack, veteran Victorian Liberal, ex-
pounded the view of this group in
Parliament last week, and he is alleged
to have an influence on Government


policy through membership of the so-
called “Whip’s room junta,” which
meets late in the evenings over a bottle
of whisky in the office of the Liberal
Party Whip, Mr. D. Erwin. Their range
of influence is said to include Mr.
Gorton and Mr. Malcolm Fraser.
But the main dispute within the Gov-
ernment relates to the priority rather
than the shape of the future defence.
Though he has sometimes been ambigu-
ous in the matter, Mr. Gorton has
fairly consistently expounded a develop-
ment-before-defence view of the alloca-
tion of the nation’s resources, thereby
implying a halt in the defence build-
up as initiated by Sir Robert Menzies
and carried through by Mr. Holt.
At the Government Members meet-
ing he said that defence had to “stack
up realistically” against other demands
on the Government, implying that it
should not consume a larger proportion
of the nation’s resources than the pres-
ent five percent. In the Treasury, the
Prime Minister has powerful support.
Financial purists, and oriented in their
thinking to Europe and North America,
in the Treasury they tend to write off
Australia’s neighbors as hopeless, unim-
portant mires of corruption and ineffi-
ciency, on which we should not
“squander” defence or economic aid.
But to Mr. Gorton’s sense of priority
the Government backbench rose in
almost unanimous revolt. Improbably
led by sacked Navy Minister Don
Chipp, they rose one by one to chal-
lenge the view that defence could be
given second priority. Mr. Chipp had
put on the agenda of the meeting an
item stating that the defence vote for
next year be determined now rather
than at Budget time, so that it would
get top priority as well as providing
some advance guidelines for the Ser-
vices who will otherwise be operating
without the framework of a plan; since
none has been produced to replace the
three-year program which lapses next
month.
Mr. Chipp’s theme was that the Gov-
ernment had to be preoccupied, with
defence. In what colleagues said was
the best speech of his political career,
he roused the meeting to unpreced-
ented applause and chair-clapping.
Every backbencher who then spoke in
the debate followed the anti-Gorton
line.
Mr. John Jess: “We (the Govern-
ment) talk as if time is at our dis-
posal. It is not ... we can plan our
priorities without waiting for the Five-
power Conference.”
Mr. P. Howson:- “It is clear that
whatever happens, Australia will have
to stand on its own feet much more
than in the past, and this will require
more money for defence.”
Mr. J. Bate: “The heart of Aus-
tralia says that we will go into (South-
East Asian) countries, spend those
enormous sums of money, and deny
ourselves many of the things we want,
so that we can defend this country.”
Mr. H. Turner: “As to cost, must
we throw away $lOO million on use-
less dams in Queensland and Western
Australia and then claim that we do
not have the money for defence? Must
we have an inefficient economy with
flaccid industries through a tariff policy
that results in feather-bedding? The
situation that Australia now faces is
different from any that it has faced
before. We stand at a crossroads?”
Mr. St. John: “First and foremost
I wish to reject the heresy that any-
thing is more important than our sur-
vival as a free nation. Our defence
policy is and must remain a matter
of first priority in our thinking and in
our budgetary appropriations . . .
(only) if we were living in a lotus land
or a fools’ paradise could, we afford the
luxury of placing first our national
development.”
Mr. Fairhall, who only adopted the
Gorton line on defence priority for his
formal statement after a fierce fight in
Cabinet, was clearly encouraged by the
onslaught of the backbench and re-
turned to the fight in ending the debate.
Having made obeisance to Cabinet
policy by rehashing the familiar phrase
that “national development underlies
whatever we do in the field of de-
fence,” he gave vent to his own feel-
ings: “Ours is a big country far away
from friends. We are living in one of
the most disturbed areas of the world
... we understand clearly that new
responsibilities are coming up. They
will impose new burdens upon us.” Im-
plicitly dissociating himself from the
official Government line, he said: “The
House (as opposed to the Government)
has accepted them, as I understand
from the debate in the past few days.”
The Prime Minister
Tempting factors
in a 1968 election
By ALAN REID
THE DECISION on whether there
will be an election this year is the
responsibility of one man the Prime
Minister. He may listen to the advice
of others. But he holds the commission.
At present the most popular occupa-
tion in Parliament House is guessing at
the answer since there is nothing
more important to parliamentarians
than elections. But the answer can only
be guessed at. If Gorton has discussed
the advantages or disadvantages of an
election this year ahead of the normal
time, which would be toward the end
of 1969, with any of his senior Minis-
ters, they are maintaining a discreet
silence. The probabilities are that Gor-
ton has not yet made up his mind.
Looked at from one angle, there are
no major advantages to him in an
election this year. He has a majority of
39 in the House of Representatives
more than sufficient to protect himself
against restiveness on the part of indi-
vidual backbenchers, the fortunes of by-
elections, and the other vicissitudes to
which a Government’s parliamentary
majority is always exposed. And indi-
cations are that Labor will be in as
dishevelled a state (if not worse) in
1969 as it is at the moment.
On the other hand, there is the
understandable human element that a
Gorton elected as Prime Minister by his
parliamentary followers after the death
of Harold Holt would probably like to
be a. Prime Minister by the vote of the
people. And there is also the possibility,
politics being what it is, that by 1969
Labor will not be in its present state
of disorder.
Then there are Liberal-Country
Party relationships. With the McEwen-
McMahon vendetta these are in a sensi-
tive position. Except when he inter-
vened during the Holt succession
struggle, to announce that neither he
nor his Country Party colleagues would
serve in an administration headed by
McMahon, McEwen has made his at-
tacks indirectly and hence endurably
from the Government’s viewpoint. But
there were occasions during this parlia-
mentary session when it appeared that
After the Budget, the electors?
McEwen’s vendetta might be conducted
on the Government’s front lawn instead
of its back garden. Gorton would prob-
ably prefer a public demonstration of
the intensity of the feud to be given
after rather than before an election.
There is another factor that might
exacerbate Liberal-Country Party feel-
ings even more extensively: the coming
redistribution of Federal election
boundaries. Even under Sir Robert
Menzies, who had built up a very tight
control over Party relationships, the CP
created very real difficulties. When it
rejected a previous proposal for elec-
toral redistribution, Menzies was placed
in the position of having publicly to
abandon the recommendations in the


Parliament, knowing well that if he did
not do so the Country Party would vote
against them, even though it might
mean the downfall of the coalition.
Although factors like these could
tempt Gorton into an early election, at
a guess I would say that Gorton is
keeping his mind flexible, prepared to
jump in either direction according to
circumstances. There are signs that his
coming Budget in August will be de-
signed with an eye to electoral consider-
ations. But this is insurance rather than
intention. If, as appears to be likely,
the Budget is framed with these elec-
toral considerations in mind, Gorton
will probably make up his mind some
time after August.
There is good sense in this delay.
After its recent upheavals, following
Gough Whitlam’s resignation and re-
contesting of the Labor leadership,
Labor will probably go quiet for a
while. There will be ripples but no
waves. The waves, however, could
come after the June State Conferences
of the ALP. Such is the Labor mood
that at these conferences anything could
set the waves rolling. For example, the
Victorian ALP executive has invited
Whitlam in his role of Labor Leader
to attend the Victorian June confer-
ence. But Whitlam has decided to boy-
cott the Victorian ALP executive and
all meetings held under its auspices
while Victoria is under its present ALP
management, which it will be in June.
If Whitlam perseveres with his boycott,
that could raise big waves.
With his Budget safely launched,
Gorton would be in a position to assess
the amount of trouble he could expect
from the Country Party against the
advantages given to him by fresh Labor
turbulence. If he decided that the elec-
toral position was such that he could
get a majority in his own right as a
Liberal in the House of Representatives
(he would need to pick up only three
extra Liberal seats to achieve this) he
might well decide on an election.
He would not be completely out of
the redistribution storm; he would still
be in a minority in the Senate, where
Country Party Senators could deter-
mine the outcome of a Labor-backed
vote; but he would be in a far stronger
position to listen to the advice of the
Country Party, the junior partners in
the coalition, without bending before
it.
There will continue to be specula-
tion for quite a long way ahead on
the possibilities of an election this
year instead of in the scheduled 1969.
But, guessing like everyone else, my
feeling is that no one will know, as
distinct from guessing, until August. It
will be then that Gorton will make up
his mind.
Japan-Australia Co-operation
Only one point drew blood
LAST WEDNESDAY, old Mrs. Matsuo
made a final TV appearance and
returned to Japan. Meanwhile, 46 lead-
ing Japanese businessmen moved on
from the bland formalities of the sixth
Japan-Australia Business Co-operation
meeting in Canberra to the supposedly
more meaty meal of the inaugural
Pacific Basin Economic Co-operation
Committee meeting in Sydney; there,
they hit a stone wall in the form of
Federal Treasurer McMahon.
Mrs. Matsuo had touched the heart.
The goodwill spread to Canberra.
While businessmen reiterated, though
politely, their familiar stands on tariffs,
making it quite clear that neither was
prepared to budge, Government spokes-
men from both camps were congratu-
lating each other on how few problems
the tariffs had in fact created. If there
were no signs of an intended removal
of protectionism, there at least seemed
to be a tacit agreement to remove it as
a formal issue between the two
countries. Thus the Japanese allowed
the Australians to make all the public
statements on the car-dumping issue
and accepted the tariff increases on
their cars without recourse to the once-
threatened confrontation before the
Tariff Board.
Mr. McEwen has disappeared from
the scene. Mr. Sinclair, his deputy,
magnanimously recognised the need for
Japan to protect its agricultural indus-
tries. The Japanese praised the Aus-
tralian Government for its scrupulous
fairness and utmost rectitude. The
drums and trumpets of the preceding
weeks had given way to masked for-
malities.
Even the car industry responded to
the climate of bonhomie. Instead of the
predicted flare-up, the meeting between
Ford’s managing director, Mr. Bourke
and Nissan’s president, Mr. Kawamata,
produced from Mr. Bourke the delight-
ful suggestion that Mr. Kawamata
should convey to his Government the
eager wishes of the Australian motor
industry to export or assemble or manu-
facture in Japan. Mr. Kawamata
advised patience; there were many
problems to solve in this direction; it
would be some time yet before such
eagerness could be translated into a
reality. In the meantime there was the
much-repeated Japanese claim that 90
percent of its imports are free from re-
strictions to be considered. On the other
hand, 76 percent of all imports into
Australia came in duty free which
all the Australian party agreed was a
“wonderful” opportunity for Japan to
increase its sales to Australia.
There were the usual gestures about
cultural treaties, and both sides agreed
to press their Governments to draw up
some formal ones on matters of trade
and navigation and taxation. A new
agreement covering transport and travel
between the two countries was thought
desirable, and the Japanese suggested
that monetary and foreign-exchange
problems could be eased if they were
allowed to set up banks in Australia.
This last point drew the only blood of
the meeting. It had been suggested
before, but this year, for the first time,
the Australian banks beat it firmly over
the head.
There was no mention of joint ven-
tures between Australia and Japan. Mr.
Hasegawa, president of Sumitomo
Chemicals, seemed somewhat irritated
but undeterred by this, and he took off
to explore the possibilities of this neg-
lected subject on his own account. For
a start, his company is already import-
ing large quantities of Australian baux-
ite at high cost, and it would be much
better from his point of view if a joint
company could process the stuff in Aus-
tralia. And jointly owned petro-chemical

plants could use Australia’s natural gas

At the opening of the meeting in
Sydney, Mr. McMahon made it quite
clear that the status quo of the Govern-
ment’s economic policy was, immovable;
protectionism would stay, despite all
the insidious talk of free trade; there
could be no consideration of the estab-
lishment of foreign banks in Australia;
and, although, “we welcome the move-
ment of foreign capital to Australia,”
on the subject of removing it again “we
reserve the right to say yes or no should
some difficulty emerge.”
In a largely predictable week of
Japanese - Australian communication,
there was the novelty of observing just
how seriously the Australian delegations
took it. In Canberra, there appeared
the most representative group yet sent
to such a meeting, and they arrived
surprisingly well prepared to smoothly
counter Japanese proposals. In fact, the
very blandness of the proceedings was
the achievement from the Australian
point of view, reflecting, as it seemed, a
closer approach to mutual appreciation,
if not understanding.
Privy Council appeals
Poor compromise
IF, IN THE years before Federation,
the Founding Fathers had been able
to exert a little more pressure on the
Imperial Government when drafting
the Australian Constitution, the prob-
lem would never have arisen. If, in
more recent years, State Attorneys
General had not been so jealous of
their rights, the anachronis'm of the
Privy Council as Australia’s highest
court of appeal would have been ended
completely last week, but, as past ex-
perience has shown, the States can be
very stubborn on matters affecting
their own sovereignty, and the Federal
Government has had to compromise its
plans to abolish Australian appeals to
an English court.
Before Federation the draftees of the
Constitution wanted to abolish the
Privy Council, considering it a relic
of colonialism that the new nation
could well do without, but the Imperial
Government insisted, and the States’-
righters of the time were not all in
favor of losing the wisdom of the
Judicial Committee’s learned members.
Retention of the Privy Council at that
time was one of a nu'mber of com-
promises that made Federation possible.
Last week the Privy Council (Limi-
tation of Appeals) Bill passed through
the Senate after three days of forensic
debate. Honoring a Government
promise made to the 65-odd percent of
Australians opposed to the Privy Coun-
cil, the Bill makes the High Court of
Australia the final appellate court for
any matters involving Federal laws or
interpretation of the Constitution. But
the Bill allows appeals originating from
litigation under State laws to be taken
all the way through the State Supreme
Court to the High Court and, if the
lawyers advise it and the client can
afford it, on to the Privy Council.
The trouble with the compromise is
that Australia will now have two classes
of litigant: one who is involved in a
matter involving a Federal law, and
one who wants to appeal in a purely
State litigation. A strange situation in a
legal system that lives by the principle
that justice must not only be done, but
must be seen to be done.
Last week in the Senate, Deputy
Opposition Leader Sam Cohen, QC,
tried to remove the anomaly by intro-
ducing an amendment preventing any
appeal to the Privy Council from any
Federal or Territory court, including
Cohen QC ... lost amendment
the High Court. Describing the Bill as
a “very unsatisfactory half-way house,”
he warned that the Government was
wandering into a “new sea of diffi-
culty.” Litigants would never under-
stand why their appeals could not go
beyond the High Court, while the man
down the street was preparing an
appeal to the Privy Council.
Senator Cohen pointed out, too, that
the legislation was extremely complex.
Litigants would probably prefer access
to both Courts, and so any marginal
cases e.g., those which might involve
Federal and State laws would need
long and involved preliminary argu-
ment on jurisdiction.
The problem with Senator Cohen’s
amendment, said Works Minister Sena-
tor R. C. Wright, was that it would
block off the Privy Council to State
litigants who chose the High Court for
their appeals. Senator Wright seemed
to be in an embarrassing position. The
former “rebel,” newly promoted to
Minister, is one of the Government’s
best legal brains; in the past he would
have gone through the Bill piece by
piece, clause by clause, revealing any

faults in the legislation. But since he
was promoted to the Ministry he has
had to defend legislation rather than
criticise it.
Senator Wright tried to point out
that, if the High Court was to be the
ultimate court of Australia, appeals
from State courts should be allowed to
pass through the High Court to the
Privy Council if necessary.
If litigants were forced to make a
choice, he said, they might by-pass the
High Court and go to the Privy Coun-
cil. Thus, the amendment might increase
the flow of litigation overseas. But
under the Government’s legislation,
Senator Wright said, most litigants
would be happy to end the matter in
the High Court, knowing the Privy
Council was still open to them.
Even though Senator Cohen’s amend-
ment was lost, and the Bill passed, the
problems have not disappeared. The
States might act to abolish their own
right of appeal to the Privy Council,
but this seems most unlikely while they
can appeal to the Privy Council from
a High Court decision. The time may
not be long before the Commonwealth
will have to step in and, in Senator
Cohen’s words, “do the second half of
the job.”
New Guinea
Mini-Ministers
IN TWO WEEKS the second Papua
and New Guinea House of Assembly
will meet in Port Moresby for what
the Australian Government sees as the
Territory’s next important transitional
.stage; and once again it remains to be
seen exactly how far-reaching this will
be. To express even so mild a doubt is,
of course, to risk instant and general
rebuke. External Territories Minister
Barnes followed a backbencher’s line
last week with a marvel of inverted
logic, calling reporting on P.-N.G.
“‘Press censorship” by which Australians
did not know New Guineans’ true feel-
ings. Earlier, the Press was assailed by
Mr. McLeay, MHR for Boothby, who
had just visited New Guinea for the
first time since 1943 and found there
had been “tremendous development.”
Mr. Boothby began with a complaint
about a newspaper headline which
read, “Freedom for New Guinea 30
Years Away Barnes,” and said the
word conjured up slavery, which does
not exist in New Guinea. Independence
was the question, and “independence
could be several generations away . . .
the vast majority of the people of New
Guinea do not want independence.
When independence does come to New
Guinea it will come at the instigation
of the people themselves; it will not be
forced on them by Australia. Every

Australia, a journalist, or an academic
shouts about independence it seems to
me that he is doing a bad thing for
the people of New Guinea . . . Papua
and New Guinea is fundamentally an
agricultural country. Obviously the
Territory needs some form of secondary
industry and investment in some other
fields. But who will invest his money
and talents in the Territory if these
shouts for independence are continually
heard?”
This fragment of a Member’s speech
contains in a few words most of the
fundamental gaps in understanding be-
tween MPs and the organs of com-
munication. Perhaps journalists see too
clearly not only the difference between
“freedom” and “independence” as head-
line material, but also that a conserva-
tive Parliament is bound to proceed
too conservatively unless prodded; that
it is absurd for anyone to say what the
people of New Guinea may want, one
to ten years in the future, or when they
might want it; that “some form of”
secondary industry is not good
enough; and, finally, that if a large base
of educated, sophisticated people were
really essential to self-government, then
Australia would have been a colony
longer.
Considered in this context, does the
coming “next transitional stage” in
New Guinea go far enough? Future
plans are expressed in the Papua and
New Guinea Bill being carried through
Federal Parliament in time to be law
when the House of Assembly in Port
Moresby opens. They are largely based
on a report from a Select Committee
of the New Guinea House of Assembly,
and were put before the Fourth Com-
mittee of the UN General Assembly
last December. It did not query them
very much, there was not even a “what
happened then?” to the quick sentence
in the preamble: “Progress was made
in the development of the Territory in
the 1920 s and 19305.”
The last years of the 1960 s are to
be different. They will be the years of
the Executive Government. The Terri-
tory will be governed by the Adminis-
trator, three official Members of the
Assembly, and seven “ministerial
members,” acting in concert as the
Administrator’s Executive Council.
The new Assembly will establish a
standing nominations committee of five
elected members. This committee will
consult the Administrator to agree on
the names of the seven ministerial
members. The agreed list will then be
submitted to the House of Assembly for
approval, and then the Minister for
External Territories will make the
appointments and allocate the minis-
terial members’ functions.
“Subject to the duty and responsi-
bility of the Administrator, acting on
behalf of the Australian Government,
to administer the Territory, the Council
would be the principal instrument of

policy of the executive government.”
As explained to the UN, “Because the
ministerial officers could not be exer-
cising the full executive authority and
responsibility which is the universal
characteristic of those elsewhere who
are designated ministers it was agreed
that the term ‘ministerial member’
rather than minister be used.”
The mini-Ministers “will be respon-
sible with the (expatriate) departmental
head for overall departmental activities
and for the framing of policy proposals
including proposals for expenditure.”
They will introduce and have the car-
riage of legislation in the House, and
generally represent their department
there. If they disagree with the depart-
mental head, the Administrator will
make a decision. And the departmental
head will retain responsibility for “the
management and public service aspects
of the conduct of the department.”
If this “significant step toward the
introduction of a ministerial system”
(together with the assignment of up to
ten assistant ministerial members to
work with various departments) had
been proposed as a very short-term
affair it could have been accepted easily
as transitional; but there is no limit on
it; it might continue until the next
elections, or the 1976 ones, or later.
What really remains to be seen is
whether an enlarged Pangu Pati will
have any or many men on the Executive
Council. If not, what will its reaction
be? Will the ministerial members be
“tame cats” or will they dare to have
differences with expatriate authority?
What diplomacy will be used in exercis-
ing decisive power?
How Canberra sees the answers to
these questions is revealed in many
phrases in the Papua and New Guinea
Bill . . . “allocation of functions would
be approved by the Minister and these
functions could be reallocated from time
to time ... to meet possible contin-
gencies the Bill will authorise the
Governor - General to terminate an
appointment if after report by the Ad-
ministrator to the Minister the Gover-
nor-General is satisfied that this would
be in the public interest.” This “you
fella behave, or else” legislation is more
likely to provoke than to stimulate.
Protection for the present set-up might
have been phrased in 'more simple terms
liad there been sufficient awareness of
how overbearing the words might sound
outside Canberra.
Contrarily, Mr. Barnes has done well
to accept the Select Committee’s re-
commendation: Territory participation
in budget framing. The Executive Coun-
cil will at least advise the Administrator
on budget policy and planning, and a
budget standing committee of five
elected members will be able to channel
further suggestions from the House to
the Administrator. There was a notion
that the Assembly should control the
34 percent of revenue raised in the
Territory, but the Select Committee felt
that ordered development would be best
served “at this stage” by a single budget.
Again in the legislation there is no time
limit on the advisory arrangement.

OVERSEAS
Saigon: a bruise to be prodded
and pressed
THE VIET CONG brought a new sort
of war to Saigon last week and the
textbooks on guerilla warfare may well
have to be rewritten as a result. It
is nothing like so dramatic or preten-
tious as the Tet attack last February.
Both militarily and politically it is,
so far, a modest affair. Yet, this is
just where its danger for the Saigon
Government lies. The Viet Cong could
not sustain the Tet offensive because
it failed to provoke widespread popular
support.
By contrast, the present attack could
develop into a permanent war, part
conventional, part guerilla, against the
South Vietnamese capital. Significantly,
the Viet Cong have used their troops
more economically this time. Other
towns have been attacked by mortars
and rockets, but only Saigon has been
properly attacked from the ground as
well.
The Viet Cong troops in and around
Saigon are also being used more
cautiously. Within the city they are
split into guerilla groups of a dozen
or less in the crowded poor areas, where
they most easily find cover. The bigger
units (the Americans have not yet
released their estimate of how many
in all) are at the city edges. From
there they can make panic-producing
probes and can also withdraw when
counter-attacked. It is the passivity
of most Saigonese toward both the
Viet Cong and the Government that
has made the Viet Cong strategy both
possible and necessary. Saigon, from
the Communists’ point of view, is
not an abscess ripe for lancing but a
bruise that is to be prodded and pressed
until the discomfort becomes demoralis-
ing.
The talks in Paris between America
and North Vietnam, with the con-
sequent nervousness of the Saigon
Government about the future, have
made Saigon the obvious place to
apply this pressure.
Paradoxically, the Viet Cong’s work
is made more difficult by the absence
of any strong sense of community in
this city. All energies are kept for the
preservation of the family. This is the
secret of the Vietnamese resilience
People of Hue sift through the wreckage of their homes. Now Americans are
uncovering the mass graves of South Vietnamese killed during the Tet offensive
through the years of war. A sort of
spontaneous social decentralisation has
taken place which has freed people of
all but their duties toward family.
The people who appear most to feel
the full sadness of events are the young,
whose ideals have not yet been out-
weighed by responsibilities of family
self-preservation. Spotty schoolboys
carrying Red Cross banners have been
trying to reach the civilian dead and
wounded, who would otherwise lie
ignored in the middle of the fighting.
A group of Buddhist students who look
after 10,000 refugees just outside Saigon
have to wrangle their way through both
Government and Viet Cong positions
each time they bring in food and
medicines.
The Viet Cong clearly hope that
people like these, vulnerable to the
horrors of war and uncertain of the
virtue and capacity of their own side,
will finally come to accept the political
settlement to the war that the Com-
munists will publicise in the months
ahead. The truth is that neither the
Saigon Government nor the Americans
have yet thought up ways of countering
the psychological and political challenge
that is the major weapon in the Viet
Cong’s attack.
The Saigon Government’s dilemma
is nicely expressed in a recent official
order that allows the Saigonese for the
first time to build shelters against
rockets and mortars. Shelters are now
legal, says the order, but they must not
be so strongly built that they might
one day be useful to the Viet Cong.
Horror at Hue
ALL WARS have their atrocities, but
some are more horrible than others. In
the American Civil War the South had
its Andersonville; but the North, too,
had its prison camps, where conditions
were only slightly less inhumane. World
War II saw the bayoneting of wounded
men in their hospital beds; it also pro-
duced the gas chambers and the living
skeletons at Belsen. The Vietnam War
has produced the savagery of the much
publicised shooting of a bound Viet
Cong prisoner by General Loan in Feb-
ruary; but it has also produced the
horrors of Hue.
Here, according to an official Ameri-
can report, more than 1000 bodies of
people executed by the North Viet-
namese in the Tet offensive have been
uncovered in 19 mass graves. Some were
shot; some were beheaded; some were
mutilated; and, in a category of its
own, some were buried alive. This was
not revenge. This was sadism.


U.S. Presidency
Homespun Hubert
HUBERT HORATIO HUMPHREY
is very likely to be the next President
of the United States or so the polls
proclaim and the professionals con-
fide. But somehow, even on the cam-
paign trail, the prophecy does not quite
carry conviction. It is not just that,
from every platform he graces, the
Vice-President regularly achieves the
miracle of making even Lyndon
Johnson sound sophisticated. Worse
than that, he is totally and irremediably
old-fashioned.
“By golly” begins one sentence.
“Good grief” opens the next. And, while
the young members of the audience are
still giggling, there he is gaily announc-
ing, “Oh, my, what a rascal I was in
those days.” It is not that Humphrey is
unprofessional; if he were he would
never have got where he is already in
American politics. It is simply that the
whole performance and presentation is
firmly rooted in a dying political
tradition.
What Humphrey symbolises and
represents is, in fact, an America that
is rapidly passing away. He is the last
of the homespun heroes, the final con-
tribution of the small town to modern
urban America. When he rousingly
declares, “Oh, boy, we Americans are
a bunch of doers,” he really believes
it, and for a moment it is indeed as if
cost-effectiveness or program-analysis
had never dared to complicate the
whole business of national administra-
tion.
It would be rash, though, to under-
estimate the effectiveness of his appeal.
He can never turn a crowd on in the
way Bobby Kennedy can, but there are
few, at least among the middle-aged
and the elderly, who do not come away
from his meetings looking all the better
for having heard him. He is the great
banisher of doubts, the remover of
fears, the booster of confidence. The
politics he talks could easily belong to
a radio revivalist preacher on some
inspiration hour.
He has, of course, come a long way
since he provoked a whole mass of
Southern delegates to walk out of the
1948 Democratic convention by insist-
ing, in a fighting speech, that a civil-
rights plank be written into that year’s
Democratic platform. But the progress
has been more political than ideological.
On three separate days last week
(in his first serious bout of campaign-
ing to win the Democratic nomination)
the Vice-President appeared before a
variety of audiences. The first was a
gathering of unskilled trade unionists,
the Building Service Employees’ Union
(which means the men who operate the
nation’s lifts). Before Hubert Humphrey
even came in it was clear that in this
setting he could do no wrong.
There was, indeed, a splendid
moment when an overenthusiastic
member demanded the distribution of
campaign badges and was gently repri-
manded with a “Yes, Brother, we’re
going to have some Humphrey but-
tons, but let’s try to do it right. We’ll
pass the resolution endorsing him first
and then we’ll hand out the buttons.”
There wasn’t perhaps much that
Humphrey could do to damage him-
self after that.
Two days later, however, it was a
rather different story. The 1,600,000-
strong United Auto Workers’ is per-
haps the most sophisticated trade
union in the world. This time the Vice-
President’s opening cry, “It’s great to
come here and see all the lovely
brothers and sisters •- it’s just great,”
evoked an embarrassed rather than
an enthusiastic response.
As an audience the 3000 UAW dele-
gates wanted something more than a
stroll down memory lane, and a nos-
talgic conducted tour of their past joint
triumphs together was all that Humph-
rey had to offer them. He left with-
out an endorsement and, even worse,
with a shrewd suspicion (confirmed
the next day when Bobby Kennedy
appeared before them and got a hero’s
welcome) that he had been replaced
in their affections by another.
Nor was there any identity of res-
ponse in the three Western States
Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska
to which the Vice-President took his
case and his appeal. Before the grass
roots troops the precinct workers
of Colorado he was on the whole a
success, even if some of them did look
slightly taken aback when he sud-
denly announced, “Lyndon Johnson is
as much a casualty of the Vietnam War
as any of our men who have been
wounded in battle.”
In the simple, sparse, rocky moun-
tain country of Wyoming he also
plainly warmed the hearts and cheered
the spirits of those attending the State
convention. In a lunchtime speech he
achieved, as he sometimes can, an
eloquent peroration on the old-time
virtues that would have done Elmer
Gantry credit.
But in Omaha, on the Nebraska-lowa
border, he had a much rougher time
no doubt partly because a dinner
audience that was having him with its
coffee had already had Bobby Ken-
nedy with its fruit cocktail.
The doubts that Kennedy had raised
about the future direction of the U.S.
somehow found a less than satisfying
answer in Humphrey’s rousing affirma-
tion, “I’m one who wants to speak out
for America,” or again in his almost
defiant cry, “I don’t think the Ameri-
can people will respond to leadership
that exaggerates the difficulties we
face and thereby terrifies the public.”
It is this kind of tone, which is creep-
ing increasingly into his speeches, that
is perhaps the saddest aspect of
Humphrey’s decline as a public figure.
The politician who years ago could
claim to be the greatest liberal fighter
of them all is now not above announc-
ing, “I den’t think we want anyone in
this election trying to build himself up
by running America down. I’m not one
who intends to sell my country short.”
The prairie expanse of forehead and
the dark, circumflex eyebrows still
dominate the face, at 56 the hair may
be grey at the roots, but care has clearly
been taken to keep it dark at the ends,
and the sudden emphatic gestures retain
the same strange spastic energy they
always had. He is endearing, he is
engaging, he is even amusing. Why,
then, the doubts about him?
It must be because he has clearly
settled for so much less than he was
capable of becoming. His ways may
always have been quaint—and in public
he was certainly no less effusive in the
Hubert Humphrey's campaign for Democratic nomination has begun as a stroll
dozen memory lane


past than he is nowadays. But he was
never before what he symbolises today
—the candidate of the Party organisa-
tion regardless of the rank and file’s
choice.
If Hubert Humphrey does win the
Democratic nomination in August (as
virtually all the soothsayers are now
predicting), his career may yet offer a
final ironic twist. He could achieve the
further miracle of emerging even
against Richard Nixon as the candidate
of the old-line politics—thereby bxfing-
ing about an unexpected “triumph for
modern republicanism.”
Britain
Unpopularity
contest
WHILE Mr. Wilson’s adversaries inside
the British Parliamentary Labor' Party,
many of them members of his own
Government, were anxiously consulting
one another over last weekend about
whether, when, and how to get rid of
him, the Prime Minister was at
Chequers with only his private staff to
think out how to hold on.
The local elections were far worse
for Labor than anybody expected.
Under Mr. Wilson’s leadership the
Party has met a catastrophe of 1931
proportions. Yet one thing is sure: the
Prime Minister will not take Mr. Dun-
can Sandys’ advice and go back to the
country. The Conservative leaders, in-
cluding Mr. Heath himself, know per-
fectly well that no Prime Minister in
his right mind would commit political
suicide. With the present electoral
swing, most of Mr. Wilson’s Cabinet
colleagues as well as the Prime Minister
himself would lose their seats.
On the other hand, two sets of cir-
cumstances might compel the Prime
Minister to go, even without volun-
tarily seeking elections. The first would
be a split within his own Party, so that
his majority in Parliament itself would
disappear. The second would be if his
own Party disowned him.
There is, of course, a strong disin-
centive for MPs to risk a Party split
which would deprive most of them of
their seats. On the other hand, the
Government is alarmed at what is cur-
rently being called a Shinwell syn-
drome: the feeling expressed by 83-year-
old Emanuel Shinwell last week that
if Mr. Wilson clings to his compulsory
incomes policy it would be better to
bring down the Government than
break with the unions and deprive the
movement of its working-class base.
Left-wing fundamentalists have con-
sistently rejected statutory incomes
restraint, but Mr. Shinwell belongs to
the Right, and defections from this side
could be serious.
The alternative threat to Harold
Wilson, that the Party itself might
British Prime Minister Harold Wilson may be unpopular, but polls [?] his Labor
Party is even more so
choose another leader, has certainly
gained currency since Thursday’s poll.
Many middle-of-the-way politicians,
inside and outside the Government, are,
for the first time, beginning to consider
this a practical possibility. But how
would this happen?
The quick way of replacing him
would be if a sufficient number of top
Cabinet colleagues refused to go on
serving under him. But it would seem
that this danger has receded after the
recent Government changes.
And, while constitutionally the
Prime Minister could be sacked any
day by a motion of the Parliamentary
Labor Party withdrawing confidence
and deciding to select a new leader,
unless the vote had been secured in
advance, which would require rare
political stage-managing, it seems
almost inconceivable that a body of
men, including over 100 Ministers,
could be prevailed upon to raise their
hands publicly to repudiate their
leader in the knowledge that he
might survive to be revenged.
During the inter-ministerial row last
December over arms to South Africa,
Mr. Wilson had privately let it be
known that, if his authority was chal-
lenged, and the Party seemed in danger
of collapsing, he would be bound to
advise the Queen to dissolve Parlia-
ment. The Palace was inclined to think
that the Queen would have no option
but to grant Mr. Wilson’s request for
dissolution, since her first Minister was
the only authentic voice of government.
Since then, some back-benchers are
understood to have sought further
elucidation from the Palace. They have
come away with the impression that,
if an alternative leader were shown to
be capable of speaking for the Cabinet
and of commanding a parliamentary
majority, the Prime Minister’s threat
of dissolution might no longer operate.
In any event, few MPs feel that in
present electoral circumstances the
threat could be taken seriously.
Given the intrinsic advantage of be-
ing in office, there is, however, good
reason why Mr. Wilson, if he keeps his
nerve, can remain at No. 10 long
enough to preside over the predicted
economic recovery and even, as his
supporters still fervently hope, over
another electoral victory. His critics
would say the rot has gone too far
and the Party cannot be rescued under
his leadership. But the Prime Minister’s
backers retort that recent public opinion
polls show that the Party is more
unpopular than he is.
French students
Paris burns
THE CARCASS of a car or something
was burning on the corner of Boulevard
St. Michel and Boulevard Montpar-
nasse. It was 2 o’clock last Wednesday
morning. The fire brigade rushing to
the spot met a long convoy of black
lorries filled with helmeted police
armed with shields and long riot trun-
cheons. Moving toward the corner of
Raspail, the convoy was overtaken by
screaming ambulances. A major drama
had just been avoided: the police had
thrown tear-gas bombs into a cafe that
was then locked. The Red Cross had
to break in to save people from
asphyxiation.
Yet this scene of night violence was
not typical of Tuesday, which, com-
pared with its bloody predecessor, was
relatively quiet. Its main feature was a
long march across Paris by some 25,000
students. Prevented by vast numbers of
police from entering their own district,
the Latin Quarter, which looked like
a besieged fortress, they trekked for
hours through the capital, chanting
slogans, marching up the Champs-
Elysees and then back to the Left Bank.
There seemed to be a tacit agreement
between the organisers, the Union
Nationale des Etudiants de France, and


the police to avoid clashes. Only to-
ward midnight, when the students tried
to enter their district, did fights flare
up and the atmosphere resemble that
of the day before.
Bloody Monday, May 6th, was quite
a day. It witnessed the most violent
demonstration the Latin Quarter has
known, at least since the war. The
Government hoped to deal with a
handful of extremists. It had to cope
with 10,000 students, on this occasion
determined not to yield. Though the
police were out in impressive numbers
and armed to the teeth, they did not
have it all their own way. Some of the
students had helmets and sticks. Cobble-
stones answered tear gas. From 3 p.m.
to well into the night it was a per-
manent struggle with skirmishes, battles,
and tactical retreats. Streets were un-
paved to provide ammunition, cars over-
turned as improvised barricades.
Boulevard St. Germain between the
Deux Magots and Odeon was no place
for stroking tourists. The figures speak
for themselves. The police claimed 345
casualties in their ranks. At least 500
demonstrators were wounded and 422
arrested.
Demonstrations are usually much
more violent in Paris than in any other
west European town. The reason seems
to be . that violence breeds violence.
France has shown once again that it has
a domestic force de frappe of the first
order.
With its Gardes Mobiles and its
Compagnies Republicaines de Securite
(the initials allow the demonstrators to
chant the slogan CRS-SS) France has
the troops needed for a civil war and
its various regimes have often used
them ruthlessly. The classical questions
about who started the violence and who
was within the law are in France only
a part of it. The police did not enter
the Sorbonne on May 3rd until they
were called for, and on Monday they
were handling an unauthorised demon-
stration. But once French policemen get
going, they are not particularly tender.
The many eyewitness reports of passers-
by beaten up, people sitting in cafes
getting a taste of truncheons, and iso-
lated demonstrators thumped to the
ground testify to that.
The efficiency and ruthlessness of
repression has as its counterpart, in the
long run, an improvement in the tech-
niques of street fighting. The angry
young men who went out on Monday
were spoiling for a fight.
But it was on the preceding Friday
that the trouble had really started. For
reasons that are still not quite clear,
the rector, M. Jean Roche, decided on
the historically unprecedented step of
calling the police into the Sorbonne.
The Government complied, probably
very willingly, convinced as it was that
unrest among students was limited to
small groups, M:o the so-called enrages
of Nanterre the new faculty of Arts
built in a slum suburb of Paris.
It must have thought that a show of
Overturned cars are the new barricades of Paris
force would solve the problem amid
the applause of the rest of the student
body. The calculation proved entirely
wrong. The closing of the Sorbonne,
the brutality of the repression, the stiff
sentences passed against demonstrators
had the opposite effect. The movement
gathered momentum, it spread to the
provinces, it attracted the support of
a number of lecturers and professors.
It is easy to see why the Government
miscalculated. The revolutionaries of
Nanterre are undoubtedly a minority.
The various groups—the followers of
Mao and of Che Guevara, the admirers
of Trotsky and the less precise seekers
after some kind of socialist society
are deeply divided among themselves.
But the Government did not grasp that
their mood of rebellion, their rejection
of the established order, corresponded
to the mood of a wider student com-
munity.
Swollen by the population bulge, the
French universities are now undergoing
a revolution of numbers. There are
now some 600,000 students, more than
twice as many as at the beginning of
the 19605. But changes in methods,
syllabuses, and approach have not kept
pace with numbers. The harshest
critics describe the universities as fac-
tories for misfits. Everybody agrees
that they are no longer suited to the
needs of the moment.
Many students fall by the wayside.
Even those who get a degree are not
sure of a job. Students do not worry
only about being squeezed lemons at
40, they worry about their immediate
prospects. It is not surprising that the
movement of protest started among
Arts students. It is not just that students
in sociology or philosophy are more
concerned with the meaning of society;
it is among them that the future unem-
ployed are more likely to be found.
Obviously many of today’s rebels will
be absorbed tomorrow and be con-
cerned only with climbing into the
establishment or getting their slice of
affluence. But they are still young
enough to listen with sympathy to
slogans about the overthrow of the
established society. The truncheon did
the rest.
The Government was not alone in
misjudging the situation. The Com-
munist Party made the same mistake.
It went on vituperating against tiny
ultra-Leftist “grouplets” when its own
young supporters, or ex-supporters, were
already flocking to mass demonstrations.
It is here that the French case adds a
twist to the international analysis of
student unrest. It was generally assumed
that whereas students in Prague or
Warsaw fight against a political order—
against the remnants of Stalinism —
students in western Europe or America
rebel against a society, that their revolt
is the other side of the coin of poli-
tical consensus. With a Republican
indistinguishable from a Democrat in
America—the argument ran —with one
Harold resembling another in Britain,
with Italy governed by a centre-left
(and the Communists tempted to join),
with a coalition ruling in Bonn, the
protesters have no alternative. But
France was seen as the exception to the
rule. Here there was a gaullist govern-
ment and a hostile opposition, including
the Communists.
It is significant that the rebels of
Nanterre have treated the Communists
as part of the establishment, part of the
consensus; and the Communist Party did
its best, at first, to justify this judg-
ment. Like the Government, it was
overtaken by events and, to its dis-
comfort, overtaken on its left.
By midweek, after yet another
peaceful march on Wednesday night,
there were some signs of appeasement.
The politicians had at last managed to
grasp the importance of what had
happened. General dc Gaulle said
something vague about the need for
order and the need for change. The
National Assembly discussed the subject
in a special session. Naturally, students
alone cannot change society. They
cannot even reform the system of higher
education. But they can act as a spur
or an eye-opener. And Paris was
awakened last week.


Ten faces of
Australian big business
By MICHAEL BAUME
AUSTRALIA is perhaps a unique
showcase of styles of doing business.
While there are typical corporations in
America or Japan or Britain, there is
no such thing as a typical way of doing
business in Australia.
It is not only that such a large pro-
portion of business is in foreign hands.
More of business in Canada is foreign-
owned than in Australia, but there the
Americans predominate. In the Austra-
lian showcases there are both the
American and the British styles and
now the Japanese style as well.
On top of this, the economy has
been jumping around so vigorously that
even in the Australian-owned businesses
no consistent style has developed. What
link is there between the new mineral
company and the old pastoral firm?
The big insurance company or the
retail chain? The new manufacturing
firms and the government-controlled
enterprises that were characteristic of
Australia long before “nationalisation”
was thought of?
We give here a quick run through
ten of the faces of big business in Aus-
tralia. But all we give is ten examples.
Behind each face there is another face,
and another.
THE BRITISH
THE MAJOR difference between
British and American companies here is
not the easily observable fact that
American companies often earn more
profits on their investment here and send
bigger proportions of it back to the
States. There are completely different
philosophies involved that produce com-
pletely different types of companies.
And on the score of profits, many Bri-
tish companies’ major role locally
seems not so much to make large pro-
fits but to maintain trading links with
Britain. Australia’s continued depend-
ence on Britain as a supplier of so many
items of capital equipment, despite
heavy Japanese and Continental com-
petition, probably rests in part on these
trading links that are paying off in far
more significant ways than in profits
for local subsidiaries.
And, in any event, much British in-
vestment in Australia was defensive
rather than aggressive; it was to protect
and develop an existing market as local
tariff laws made things increasingly
tough for imports rather than the start-
ing-from-scratch, looking-for-the-best-
opportunities sort of investment from
America. So the Americans dominate
some of the fastest-growing sectors of
the economy.
But the main difference in philosophy
is that the British invariably regard their
Australian subsidiaries as local com-
panies to be staffed and run as such by
the locals; the Americans invariably re-
gard them as links in an international
chain to be staffed and run by members
of their international management team
for the greater glory of the international
corporation.
A typical example of the British
philosophy is Unilever (it is half owned
by the Dutch, but its chairman is always
British). Here the local subsidiary,
which plays such a dominant role in
detergents, toiletries, ice-cream, mar-
garine, and prepared-foods business, is
run by 58-year-old Garth Barraclough,
an Australian whose four-man board of
directors is made up of local men. Uni-
lever’s world-wide policy is the “isation”
one; “Australianisation” of the local
company is complete. Its independence
from its parent is beyond the wildest
dreams of most American local
tnanagers, although it has to submit its
really big capital projects to Britain for
agreement. But provided the parent
company gets a reasonable return (and
reasonable seems to mean that it leaves
about 70 percent of the profit in Aus-
tralia for reinvestment here), the British
seem to leave the company pretty much
alone (although it does proffer a great
deal of technical advice which is keenly
sought after by the locals).
Local top management have never
had to go through the mill of working
their way around the international cir-
cuit to get to the top; they all had to do
a bit of a spell overseas (Barraclough
himself had seven years running the
Philippines operation), but their future
has always been with the Australian
company unless they wished it other-
wise. And all of them knew they could
get the top jobs here if they were good
enough; that these would not be going
to some international man just passing
through for a few years.
Everyone knows Unilever’s products,,
even if they don’t know Unilever:
Rinso, Omo, Lux, Persil, Softly, Sun-
light, Velvet, Lifebuoy, Vim, Handy
Andy, Rexona, Pears, Pepsodent, Sun-
silk, Rosella foods, Stork and Fairy
margarines, Continental soups, Minit
meals, Deb, Surprise peas, Puffin cake
mix, and Street’s ice-cream are all Uni-
lever’s.
But how efficient is Unilever? It is in
a tough field, and it follows all the
modern rules of ’management, hiring
bright boys from the universities, having
its own intensive training schemes. But
in recent years its results have been
fairly pedestrian in view of the mil-
lions of dollars invested in the business;
last week the company at last reported
a much improved profit following the
years of problems that came with some
rapid expansion during the early 19605,
when it took over Streets and Rosella.
Last week’s news of a 1967 sales rise
to $88.4 million and a 30 percent rise
in profit to $3.3 million still meant that
the company was earning only 3| cents
on every dollar’s worth of sales and
at the rate of 7.7 percent on the $4l-^-

TEN FACES
million invested in the company. This,
it complains, is “only 'modest.”
But this “modest” return is largely
because of the low profits the company
is still making on its takeovers in
food and ice-cream (in Streets last year
the company provided almost three
times as much in depreciation of its
assets than it declared in net profit,
and with Rosella depreciation was
twice as much as profits.)
The British parent company does
not appear to be nagging too ’much
about the time it is taking for these
two enterprises to come good; this
acceptance of the fact that projects
take time to pay off is one thing the
British have in common with American
companies out here.
THE AMERICAN
SO WILLING are Americans to wait
for profits that most Australians who
have joined in joint ventures with
Americans here have had a pretty
disappointing ride for much longer than
they bargained for; four or five
American “partial takeovers” in the
local chemicals and fertilisers industries
have resulted in depressed profits and
share prices for the Australian partners.
And the same goes for the Australian
companies that joined with Alcoa, the
Aluminium Company of America, when
it started up here (at the invitation
of its local partners) seven years ago;
it has yet to pay a dividend. (But if
it follows the pattern of its predeces-
sors, like General Motors-Holden’s, the
dividends will be very big when they
do eventually come.)
Alcoa is a typical sort of American
co’mpany in Australia in many other
ways; its senior staffing is very much
along the international corporation
lines, with the top men spending their
three or four years here as part of
Alcoa’s A. C. Sheldon
their journey up the international
ladder. True, half the board of direc-
tors are Australians but then Austra-
lian interests have a 49 percent stake
in Alcoa’s bauxite-alumina-aluminium
complex and none of them are
executives, anyway. All the executive
directors under Harvard - trained
managing director A. C. Sheldon are
Americans and it seems pretty unlikely
that an Australian would ever get so
high in the company unless he joined
the international Alcoa set and took
pot-luck about where he was sent.
There are Australians in charge of
several departments in the company,
like personnel, advertising, market
research', economic analysis, and the
'mining operation. But the key jobs are
all filled by Americans and there is a
clear limit on how high a man can go
in Alcoa if he insists on staying in
Australia.
But there is rapid growth in the
company nonetheless; its rate of expan-
sion has been staggering for a company
that only produced its first ingot of
aluminium four years ago.
Alcoa is also typical of an increasing
number of American corporations that
are going into joint ventures with Aus-
tralians. Developmental projects like
Hamersley iron, Mt. Newman, the
Savage River, Bass Strait oil, Gladstone
alumina, and Weipa bauxite are all
joint ventures (some with British inter-
ests, too) with American partners.
There are still 'many American corpora-
tions, like General Motors-Holden’s,
Ford, and Chrysler, that are very much
on their own, but they are growing
steadily less typical of the American
face of Australian business.
THE JAPANESE
TEN YEARS ago there was hardly a
Japanese company of much con-
sequence in Australia; now they are
playing a major role in Australia’s
external trade. Mostly this simply
reflects the increasing trade ties between
Australia and Japan; but not entirely,
as companies like C. Itoh are far
more than just agents in Australia for
Japanese companies. They are trading
companies that sell Australian goods
throughout the world; Itoh is probably
the biggest seller of Australian wool
and much of this goes to Europe. In
addition, Itoh’s representative chain
through Asia and the islands acts as
a distribution agency for Australian
exporters as well as Japanese ones.
The magnitude of the job now being
done by N the Japanese trading companies
is staggering. Eleven years ago, when
its local subsidiary was established,
Itoh’s turnover was about $lO million
in Australia; it is now 12 times that
at $l2O 'million (of which wool makes
up about half). And as well as being
a trader, it also has taken a stake in
financing some Australian develop-
mental projects, with a 2J percent stake
in the Mt. Newman iron-ore scheme,
an interest in a salt project in W.A.,
C. Itoh’s Takeo Masuda
and in prawn fishing off the Northern
Territory.
Japanese trading companies have a
character of their own; they are not
only merchants but also develop
markets, stimulate manufacturers to
cater for them, invest in raw-materials
operations, and provide finance for
customers. C. Itoh is a typical “So Go
Sho Sha”; it runs its Australian opera-
tion through its astute local managing
director, Mr. Takeo Masuda, much as
if it were at home in Japan.
There are many Australians on the
staff, some in senior positions. But it
is a Japanese company and its character
remains so, even to the Japanese style
of venerating age by paying salaries
more in keeping with maturity than
responsibility. It seems unthinkable
that an Australian would ever get to
the top of this company; no Australian
could become so Japanese.
THE MANUFACTURER
THERE IS a caricature of Australian
companies showing them as dull,
unimaginative, uncompetitive (always
looking for a cosy market-sharing deal
rather than full-blooded competition),
whose only initiative is in grabbing
overseas patents to make locally the
products that have been invented over-
seas, whose management is generally
both pigheaded and incompetent, and
which' only exist at all because of the
featherbedding given by the Customs
tariff.
The caricature may have been right
not so long ago; it is less and less so
nowadays. Increasingly, Australian
industrial companies are becoming
more efficient (at least within the
limits set by the economic situation in
which they are set), are coping with
increasingly competitive conditions, are
trying to do more of their own develop-
mental work on their products (even


though they still depend for the bulk
of their initiatives on overseas), and
are adopting modern management
techniques. They still have a long way
to go. But, if Email is a typical
example, they are at least trying.
Email, the maker of industrial electri-
cal equipment (like meters) and con-
sumer durables (stoves and fans and
so on) is a fairly typical Australian
industrial company that has been going
through an agonising readjustment in
recent years to bring itself out of the
caricature class into the “efficient”
group.
It is a big business, employing about
6000 people, of whom 1300 are in its
factory at Orange, the largest decentral-
ised industry in Australia, where the
company has at last overcome the prob-
Email’s A. Burton Taylor
lems involved in its acceptance of the
eternal non-verity that it’s wise to
decentralise.
To some extent, Email is still a bit
dull; its “image” is far from dynamic;
its reports to the public shareholders
are drearily presented. It still depends
heavily on foreign licences but it is
doing a great deal of work locally,
even if the bulk of it is in adapting
foreign designs to suit local conditions;
it has solved its management-control
problems by making, of its own accord,
the same sort of revolutionary changes
in its organisational structure that BHP
paid some U.S. management consultants
to recommend, so the autocracy set up
by the tough man who built the com-
pany into its leader role, the late Joe
Carroll, has been replaced by a smooth,
modern American - style committee
system under its new boss, Alvin Burton
Taylor. But it has been a hard struggle
to get Email into modern dress after
Carroll’s death left the usual legacy
of problems that follow the rule of a
tough man whose major skill was in
building up his company. Email, like
the rest of Australian secondary
industry in its massive developmental
stage after the war, needed tough com-
pany builders more than anything else.
Now the need for them is gone. Now
the need is for more managers to run
the structures so hastily erected, and
the transition from builders to man-
agers has been a particularly difficult
one for Australia to make, mainly
because there has been no management
tradition. That was the problem with
Email; it is probably being solved fairly
well.
It is symptomatic that Taylor came
from outside the company to take
control of Email; Carroll had not left
the group with a logical successor.
Moving across fronT'Rheem Australia
(where he was managing director after
20 years with the company), Taylor
has had 10 years at Email reorganising,
developing, pruning.
It was also symptomatic that Email’s
shares should have been so dull for so
long in the stockmarket; the bulk of
Australian industrial shares have been
poor performers in the markets in
recent years. But even this is changing
now and while Email’s 50-cent shares
were only 36 cents two years ago, they
are now up around 80 cents. For the
co'mpany’s style is changing. It is no
longer the play-it-by-ear sort of show
that so many other Australian com-
panies still are, staffed by friends and
relations of the boss; now, its managing
director (inevitably an accountant;
accountancy and law have a lien on
Australia’s top management jobs)
recruits staff that is university trained
or is doing some sort of tertiary educa-
tion. The company is not nearly as dull
as it makes itself out to be.
THE FINANCIER
LAST YEAR Australian life assurance
companies had to work out how to
spend about $340 million; this year
the AMP alone will probably have to
spend about $2OO million. All of a
sudden, the life offices have become
massive sources of capital, playing a
major role in providing loan funds to
the Government, cash for city property
developments, finance for companies,
and even a bit of money for national
development.
There are real problems involved in
getting the money out into the right
sort of investment; the way the life
offices are falling over themselves to
pay absurd prices for city redevelop-
ment blocks in Sydney and Melbourne
shows that there is plenty of competi-
tion involved in this spending (exacer-
bated by the hordes of British develop-
ers who are also trying to grab all the
good development sites they can in the
cities).
So the monumental dullness of life
assurance companies (that once was
relieved only by the energy of their
salesmen) has been replaced by a new
eagerness to spend the money that is
rolling in to thetn, largely as a result of
the sudden burst of superannuation busi-
ness, as most companies are now pro-
viding some sort of scheme for their
employees. Clearly the busiest of them
all is the AMP, the venerable 119-year-
old institution whose annual meeting
was held last week, and which has led
them all into the new fields of providing
finance for development with a social
conscience that far outshines that of
many of its smaller competitors.
The AMP has committed $ll million
to the Mt. Newman iron-ore project;
it is involved in financing the Savage
River iron-ore scheme, natural gas
pipelines, Gove bauxite, various land-
development schemes and is a major
pastoralist through its Stanbroke
operation.
By the end of last year its loans
to companies on debentures or notes
totalled $l5O million; it had lent
The AMP’s Keith Steel
another $490 million on mortgage; it
owned properties valued (conserva-
tively) at almost $2OO million and
shares that cost more than $2OO mil-
lion (and are probably worth many
millions 'more at their present market
value). It has become the 20th biggest
life office in the world.
So it is important for an Australian
company seeking cash to be able to
satisfy the life-office investment men
that it is a good investment; increasingly,
the fate of companies is depending on
how they rate as investment risks by
the life offices.
And who are these men? The chief
executive of the AMP Society is 51-
year-old Keith Steel, a man who worked
his way up the company structure from
office boy in the sort of romantic rise
that is becoming less and less probable
as 'more and more companies (the AMP
included) set their recruitment targets
to much higher than they did pre-war.
Now it helps in the race for advance-
ment in the AMP’s bureaucracy if you
are a university man; life assurance
salesmen need not apply.
Now the life assurance companies are
bristling with bright young men who


TEN FACES
are working their way up the hierarchy,
taking training schemes, doing extra
degrees. Life offices are no longer the
preserve of dreary actuaries and thou-
sands of clerical assistants; now the
image is more that of computer pro-
grammers (the AMP is the biggest
commercial user of co’mputers in Aus-
tralia).
THE RETAILER
AUSTRALIAN retailing is not just a
melange of closures and collapses, des-
pite the disasters of Reid Murray, Cox
Bros., Marcus Clark, and so on. It has
gone through a revolution in recent
years that has brought magnificent suc-
cess to some companies as the others
have gone down. The prime example
of the new wave in retailing is Grace
Bros., the company that discovered the
suburbs and is making its fortune with-
out one inner-city store. Its seVen big
suburban shopping centres encircle
Sydney, setting off a trend that Mel-
bourne’s Myer’s, South Australia’s John
Martin, and, lately, Sydney’s David
Jones’, have followed with impressive
results.
But Grace Bros, claim no credit for
deciding to lead a revolution in shop-
ping habits; they were forced to the
suburbs, they say, because traffic con-
gestion, even pre-war, was beginning
to clog up access to their Broadway
store and because the Government re-
sumed their city building in York Street
(and probably did Grace Bros, a good
turn; its three floors of shops in the
19305, in what was mainly an office
block, had never done really well,
anyway).
It was not until the mid-19505, when
building restrictions were lifted, that
Grace Bros, could begin its suburban
move in earnest. From being a dreary,
small company, Grace Bros, has become,
with Myer’s, a leader of the industry.
Yet there is nothing exceptional about
Grace Bros’ “Mick” Grace
the backgrounds of the men who run
Grace Bros. Apart from the chair-
man and managing director, Mr. B. A.
(“Mick”) Grace, whose father started
the business 84 years ago, the top men
in the company all came up the hard
way, sweeping behind the counter
during the Depression, all with fairly
moderate educational careers and none
of whom could afford the luxury of
going to university, before getting a job.
But now that the company is so big'
and successful, Grace Bros, is looking
for a different kind of person; it is not
absolutely necessary to be well educated
in order to get on these days in Grace
Bros., but the company is trying to
attract more and more university
graduates into the industry and no
longer regards retailing as a skill that
can be just as easily picked up by boys
who leave school at 15. And the com-
pany’s rapid expansion (it now employs
6000 staff, compared with 1100 only
14 years ago) has meant that there are
plenty of middle-management oppor-
tunities, and it is getting good-calibre
people to fill them. This is despite the
problems in convincing graduates or
good-quality Wyndham boys that re-
tailing is a worthwhile career (apart
from the week bogy!).
But now the big question is whether
the new-organisation men who are
coming into Grace Bros, will be able to
sustain the dynamic pace set by the
men who came up the hard way. It is
a question of great relevance to a great
deal of Australian business.
THE WOOL MAN
THE MOST distinctly “Australian”
companies in Australia are the wool-
broking-pastoralist-merchant organisa-
tions, like the mighty Elder Smith
Goldsbrough Mort group that is now
being so thoroughly forgotten about
while the minerals boom goes up and
up. Yet, in balance-of-payments terms,
Elder Smith at the moment is alone
worth more to the country than all
the minerals projects put together. Out
of Elder’s total turnover of $566
million last year, more than half went
in exports; its wool turnover was $2OO
million (more than a quarter of the
Australia total); its livestock sales
totalled only a little less; it sold $5O
million worth of properties; $97
million worth of merchandise, $5B
million worth of rural goods and farm
machinery; it did $47 million worth of
general trading and then managed on
the side to lend about $95 million to
farmers, run a shipping agency, a
travel agency (with turnover of SBJ
million), a trustee company, and some
sheep stations. It also has some invest-
ments, including a 40 percent stake in
Lensworth Finance and a small interest
in the Gove bauxite project. Out of all
this, which was probably a lot less than
it would have been but for the drought,
it made a profit of almost $6 million.
Elders is concentrated mainly in
South Australia and Western Australia,
H. C. Schmidt
although the merger
six years ago with
N.S.W. - based
Goldsborough Mort
brought large east-
ern States activities
into the group; its
board of directors
reads like a list of
the top men in the
Adelaide establish-
ment, and it fol-
lows the quaint old habit of old-style
co'mpanies like the Bank of N.S.W. and
the AMP Society of having no execu-
tives on the board at all; its general
manager, H. C. Schmidt, is, like the
other senior executives, a product of the
company.
THE MINERALS MAN
NOT ONLY is Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia the biggest and most diversi-
fied mining group in Australia at a
time when mining is boo'ming but it
is also the nation’s 'most rapidly chang-
ing company. In the past five years,
its assets and profits have both trebled,
to $370 million and $l5 million res-
pectively; five years ago almost all its
profits came from lead, zinc, and
uranium; now these make up less than
half as the company’s stake in booming
new industries like iron ore, beach
sands, and aluminium, and its j big new
developments in copper, acids, fer-
tilisers, and chemicals have spread the
company into a 'major mining and
industrial complex.
But it is nonetheless typical of
the remarkable leaps forward going
on right through the minerals industry;
the developments that are the basis of
the boom are also bringing rapid
changes to the companies that are par-
ticipating in the’m. The question yet to
be answered is whether these companies
are able to cope with the demands now
being made on them; it is not just a
CRA’s Sir Maurice Mawby


TAA’s John P. Ryland ... a tradition of freedom
question of whether there are enough
skilled operatives, like geologists, to go
around (there aren’t) but whether man-
agements can rise to the occasion. If
CRA is a typical example, the prospects
are that they can.
The company’s style is recognisable;
in most of its major operations it is in
partnership with other interests, so that
it gets the best of all worlds. It has
54 percent of Hamersley Iron in
partnership with Kaiser of the U.S.,
with whom it is also in partnership
with its massive bauxite-aluminium
developments; it owns one-third of
lead-zinc miner New Broken Hill, 75
percent of Sulphide Corporation, half
of Broken Hill Associated Smelters, 51
percent of Mary Kathleen Uranium,
23 percent of Cobar Mines, two-thirds
of Bougainville Copper, 53 percent of
Interstate Oil, and 27 percent of a
W.A. nickel prospect. This “partner-
ship” style is now fairly typical of the
whole industry.
These associations are vital in help-
ing the company fulfil the role required
of it in putting up 'major plants to
process the minerals it extracts, such
as its iron-ore pellet plant (and plans
for metallised agglomerates) and its
alumina refinery at Gladstone.
But the most important feature of
its part-ownership pattern is that it is
only partly owned by Australians; all
but 15 percent of the company’s capital
is held by the British Rio Tinto Zinc
Corporation, a company that was
formed six years ago out of the merger
of Consolidated Zinc with Rio Tinto.
This underlines the foreign influence
throughout the industry.
Nevertheless, its chairman and chief
executive, Sir Maurice Mawby, is very
much an Australian mining man, and
despite the presence of RTZ’s powerful
boss, Val Duncan, on the local com-
pany’s board, it gives the appearance
of being an Australian-oriented com-
pany. Of course, there are areas of
possible conflict, such as in uranium
and rare earths where RTZ has big
deposits in other countries that it may
prefer to exploit before it mines its
Australian deposits. But CRA denies
this and strongly asserts that it is doing
its best for Australia at all times.
THE GOVERNMENT MAN
PRIVATE bureaucracies are often
more inefficient than public ones; pub-
lic enterprises are often more enter-
prising than private ones. In Australia,
Government instrumentalities have got
a pretty good business record (provided
they are clearly distinguished from the
departmental businesses like buses and
railways, which are run on such drearily
Public Service lines).
Trans-Australian Airlines is the prime
example of the well-run, profitable
Government enterprise, where the only
important differences separating it from
private enterprises are that it has no
shareholders (having an appointed
Commission instead of an elected board
of directors) and that its bureaucracy
is a lot more efficient than that of many
private-enterprise ones.
It may be largely due to TAA’s luck
with its management (its tough ex-pilot,
ex-Ansett man, general manager John
P. Ryland has been the boss for 13
years) that it has managed to remain
so independent and competitive, so
unpublic servicy; that in the 20 years
or so of its existence it has managed
to create a tradition of freedom from
Governmental control—except for the
oppressive restraints on freedom of
activity under the. two-airline systems
that appear to have been far more to
TAA’s disadvantage than to its private-
enterprise rival, Ansett-ANA.
To some extent, TAA is also lucky
because there is something about the
airline industry that attracts good
people and makes them loyal and
enthusiastic —despite the remarkable
disadvantage that TAA’s governmental
status means that its senior salaries are
ridiculously low in a private-industry
context.
There are many ex-pilots in TAA’s
management, but there is plenty of
scope for anyone to progress; perform-
ance is the criterion of promotion, not
seniority. And despite the specialist
divisions within TAA, the management
keeps its eyes open for able young
people it can shuffle around for mana-
gerial experience. Its flexibility is one
of the main features distinguishing
TAA from the Government service.
THE CONTINENTAL
THERE are very few Continental-
owned big businesses in Australia, but
there are plenty of big businesses run
by Continentals now living in Austra-
lia that have a distinctively different
style about them.
The Continentals’ greatest impact
has been in the clothing trade and
property development; their style is
still that of the tough one-man show, as
few of the many companies they have
created in the past 20 or 30 years
have emerged into that state of develop-
ment which calls for managers of
companies rather than creators of them.
Many of these Continental companies
suffer on the stock exchanges because
of investors’ fears of what will happen
to them when the tough man dies or
retires; Osti without Thee'man, Stocks
and Holdings without Graf.
Typical of the Continental face is
Stocks and Holdings, the project
Stocks and Holdings’ Erwin Graf
developer company through which
Hungarian-born Erwin Graf, still in his
40s, has done so much to change the
look of Sydney. He is the tough man
at the top of the company he built
up from nothing (he arrived here
owing £2O) in only 18 years. His style
is dedication and energy; seeing oppor-
tunities and taking them. Graf’s com-
pany, which started off building small
factories in 1950 and switched to push-
ing up the cheapest form of housing
(seven squares of fibro on cheap land),
was the first of the project builders on
any scale, the first to build a city
mixed development (the Park Regis is
a Stocks and Holdings project), the
first major arcade redeveloper, the first
to put up town houses, and it has rid-
den the home-units boom for all it is
worth.
But Graf sees no special Continental
flavor as such about his company; his
being a European gave hi'm no special
advantages in bulding project houses
or flats for other Continentals (he com-
plains they are harder to deal with
than Australians); his staff is not
heavily European; his board is split
about 50-50 between Australians and
Europeans in nu'mbers but in power
it is all Continental, it is all Graf.


A new chum
on the
Murrumbidgee
By BRIAN HOAD
Last century a "new chum" from England might go to the Riverina for a
year or two to get his colonial experience. Brian Hoad, a Londoner, recently
spent a few days following one of his predecessors down to the Murrumbidgee
area to see how things had changed.
“Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters”
“THE RAIN —well, I heartily wish a
plague on it. It rains every day and
all day and every night, too. The
plains here have been quite soaked
through and through and resemble
more a vast straggling marsh than any-
thing else. What with all the incon-
veniences of a bush life in matters of
meat and drink and living, the question
appears to be now how one is to pre-
serve his health without falling a prey
to rheumatisms, malaria, and fever.
The bush life is not suited in any sense
to city folks; and no real city folks
could ever become enamored of it.”
So a “new chum” down on the
Murrumbidgee of the 1870 s lamented
his voluntary exile from rolling gentle
Shropshire and the seasonal jollifica-
tions of Dickensian London. A dreary
and dismal time he had of it, too: the
muddy waters of the Murrumbidgee
were undrinkable unless mixed with
stronger liquids, the hotels were
“wretched,” the bark roofs leaked, the
bread and cheese were rotten, the
mutton uneatable, the servants per-
petually drunk on vile brandies, and
the “solitariness and anxieties of bush
life” wearied him unto death. He did
not stay on to see the change that
started to come about some 40 years
later, and still continues.
From a bird’s-eye point of view the
land fed by the waters of the Murrum-
bidgee appears extraordinarily ordered
and controlled for such an overtly
untamable continent. The vast plain
with scarcely an undulation is layed
out with geometrical precision
squares, oblongs, triangles, parallel-
ograms dissected and linked by the
straight lines of roads and canals; toy
sheep in neat pastures, papiermache
trees in neat orchards; Walter Burley
Griffin towns in neat circles, though
growing a little ragged round the
edges.
On the ground it’s all a little more
confusing. Sitting under one of the
7000 Burley Griffin trees in Leeton
on a hot afternoon in early autumn,
for example, one could engage an
attractive piece of pure Calabrian ex-
traction in idle conversation as she
delicately picks the last tenacious grape
pips from between the toes of her
stained feet. Yes, she has been treading
the grapes this afternoon. Yes, lots of
people tread the grapes in Leeton.
Yes, they are very fond of wine there,
in fact they drink twice as much wine
per head of population as the national
average, and their vines are almost un-
believably prolific. Other statistics
creep in—non-British stock make up
60 percent of the population of the
area—“though all but four have be-
come Australian nationals just as soon
as possible”—one in three weddings in-
volves an interbreeding of the separate
stocks, and with Anglo-Saxon inhibi-
tions undergoing such a dilution it be-
comes less surprising to learn that they
marry earlier, have more children, and
fewer miscarriages than the rest of
Australia.
A more unnerving confrontation is
with the scimitared black bills of some
sacred ibis in the middle of a Murrum-
bidgee rice paddy—a displacement in
space and time to the pea-green irriga-
tion channels of the middle-Nile in the
Middle Kingdom to the lotus swamps
of the temple of the ibis-headed god at
Heliopolis.
One could not expect the peony-
cheeked farmers of the Murrumbidgee
(the rose does not do justice to this
hearty breed) to be so waylaid by anti-
quated memory mechanisms of the Old
World. Nonetheless, they hold the ibis
in respect. They may slaughter the
rice-eating galahs as they puff up in a
pink cloud, they may lay in ambush
with their carbide cannons at the ready
as an army of 10,000 squawking white
cockatoos prepares to attack. They
take eager pot-shots at the wild duck
and despise the bald and bandy coots.
But the ibis is inviolate. No deification,
as yet, no brazen images erected bn the
sluice gates, but a basic metamorphosis
from bird—through marsh—to water.
The 'farmers would pour scorn on
any suggestion of the occurrence of
pantheistic nonsense. They are too
solidly in favor of the old-time
prophets, particularly when it comes to
a sermon in church or chapel. Isaiah
32:20 is a grand old favorite of the
Rice Growers’ Co-operative: “Blessed
are ye that sow beside all waters.”
They have their latter-day prophets,
too —Sir Samuel McCaughey’s vision
splendid: “The waters of the Common-
wealth, if placed on the surface of the
ground so that they could be used for
irrigation . . . would be of more value
to Australia than the discovery of gold;
for gold will eventually become
exhausted while water will continue as
long as the world.”
And if there’s one thing guaranteed
to ruffle the placid affluent life down
there—and indeed, of late, make the
farmers feel quite sick in the stomach
—it is the thought of all that water
running down rivers to the sea. They
know far deeper than we the essential
goodness of the transformation that
the waters dammed back at Burrunjuck
has brought about on that frightful
rotation of fevered marsh and burnt-up
desert. And it’s no good our arguing
otherwise. Arguments of international
trade, of world surpluses of wheat or
cotton or rice or canned fruit, balance
of payments and defence problems just
don’t seem real when you’re bringing
in yet. another record harvest, barbe-
cuing your yearling steaks under the
willows, and cracking another cask of
last year’s vintage. And they don’t
make sense when the high priests of
the CSIRO, of the Leeton and Yanco
Research Stations are pollinating and
grafting and inseminating, casting their
statistics into a computer as their fore-
bears at Heliopolis cast entrails into the
sanctified flames to ensure that all shall
be made clear how next year the earth
shall be more fruitful than before. The
same optimistic enthusiasm is at work
that caused the early pioneers of Mur-
rumbidgee irrigation to plant willows
in such flamboyant profusion and to
choose to grow rice in eight inches of
water for five months of the year,
revelling in their victory over nature
and their good luck.
And that’s the rub, really. The dams
have replaced the shadoofs. The com-
puter has made the study of entrails
dispensable. The Murrumbidgee is very
much of our time, whether it manages


A plain laid out with geometric precision
Cotton —revelling in another victory?
Vines —and thirst —unbelievably prolific
to accept the fact or not. The rice is
being planted by low-flying aircraft
these days, the cotton is defoliated be-
fore harvesting with one of that mon-
strous brood of chemicals designed for
war. French machines control the
fermentation at the wineries, American
machines pluck and gin the cotton,
Japanese machines mill the rice to a
starchy neutrality, and synthetic chem-
icals replace the goodness so lost.
Time, in the towns, has swept the
bark roofs away to make room for rows
of bright new shops bursting with
bright new products of a technological
age. One is hurried past the dark brown
entrance halls of new chums’ wretched
hotels—where the dusty palm guards
the dirty cedar stairway to the chamber
pot under the massive creaking brass
bedstead—to the synthetic confines of
the übiquitous motel. There, all dreams
of “country” breakfasts fade for ever
as you scrape the butter and the honey
from tiny plastic coffins and poke dis-
consolately at the tea-bag in the alum-
inium pot. There has been no sun-
kissed bird-sung awakening down on the
Murrumbidgee, only the roaring com-
bustion engines of the early departures
and the choking cloud of carbon mon-
oxide injected under the badly fitting
door.
Superficially, it would seem, the
people of this surprising Eden are at
one with themselves and today. And
yet I do not think they are. I suspect
that they are seeking the best and
shunning the responsibilities of both
worlds, no matter how unconsciously.
They show it in a simple and very
practical way. To the Federal Parlia-
ment they send a quietly bucolic mem-
ber of tbe Country Party and to the
State Assembly from which all financial
aid and water flows they send a tailor-
made politician, sharp, smart, city-born,
city-orientated, and enviably irrepres-
sible. “You’ll never shift old A 1 from
■down here . . . Do you know he was
the only Labor MLA to raise his
majority in the last election.” Albert
Jaime Grassby is as potent a water
symbol as the ibis, and undoubtedly
more effective.
Grassby and his wife, Lenore, are as
different from the people that have
elected them as chalk from the local
ewe-milk cheese. And they have
assumed the mantle of the role put
upon them with the required panache.
Lenore likes to see A 1 looking smart.
She likes to send him off to Sydney on
a hot summer’s day in a cool, white
suit, white shoes, white tie and all. A 1
is equally particular about how Lenore
appears —and black hair piled high
above black lace piled high on a black
“maxi” most certainly appears quite
stunning. But then A 1 has plenty of
scope for choice; Lenore runs the local
fashion boutique. She buys her stock
from the trendy young designers of
Melbourne, whom she thinks make
Quant look like an old hat.
In the circumstances, it is Lenore
who is expected to plunge herself into
the latest fashion first, and the other
ladies of the Murrumbidgee are ex-
pected to follow. On an ordinary day
in Leeton or Griffith the citizens appear
much the same as they do in any other
country town, but with A 1 and Lenore
in residence one can never be quite
sure just what’s hanging up in the
cupboards.
And if it’s haute couture which is
shipped up from Melbourne, it is good,
plain money' that flows down from
Sydney. The new $42 million Blower-
ing Dam will start storing up the flow
of the Tumut River this month and
the N.S.W. Government has drawn up
a $2O million program “aimed at en-
suring that the waters are used to pro-
vide optimum benefit through the
Murrumbidgee Valley.” Associated with
this will be the Coleambally irrigation
area, where a thousand new farms and
a new town are expected to be born,
doubling the output of the present
Murrumbidgee area, combining with
it in some 30 years to form a com-
munity of 100,000 people with a farm
output of $lOO million a year.
It is quite appalling to think of this
great scheme being carried through a
murky sea of faltering political and
economic systems on a simple wave of
optimism. It is ennervating to consider
tbe future of the Western world’s
primary industries when the big shake-
out is over. But prophets of doom are
shouting into the wind when they shout
down the Murrumbidgee. There, the
people are fresh from facing the only
horrible fate they know of. They have
watched the level of Burrunjuck
steadily fall over the past few years.
There have been nasty allusions in the
Press to death by “strangulation”; the
sheep were said to be dropping off like
flies; the Rice Marketing Board
solemnly announced that $5 million
worth of rice had been lost. On
March 11 the water from Burrun-
juck ceased; it was 10 percent full and
that feeble flow had silted up. For the
first time in its history, the Murrum-
bidgee Irrigation Area was in the grip
of an official drought.
We went down there a few weeks
later expecting in all innocence to see
the worst —the willows stripped of their
leaves to feed the dying flocks, the
decomposing carcasses, the withered
crops—a sobering wasteland. When
we arrived it was raining, with new
chum’s “straggling marsh” somewhat in
evidence; the clay soils, somewhat
taken by surprise, not knowing quite
what to do with the water falling on
them. The farmers were not at all
happy; the crops—which had not
withered—were ready for harvesting
were it not for the rapidly forming
mud-baths outside. The willows trailed
in all lushness and those poor dead
sheep were now rumored to have been
venerable ewes fit only for the dogs’
home. The peaches and apricots were
already in their tins, the citrus still
green and sprightly on their trees.
And the rice grain looked so rich and
heavy that the stalks were showing
every indication of collapsing under
the strain—“We should bring in 200,000
tons of paddy rice this year . . . Last
year there were 210,000 tons, but that
was an all-time record . . . Do you
know these fields bear the heaviest
crop in the world?” And who would
not have felt glad that another Mur-
rumbidgee harvest had been brought
safely home?


A bigger roll for actors
By SANDRA HALL
ACTORS’ EQUITY is not much given
to cheery pronouncements about its
union members’ welfare. So when it
says there are 100 actors earning as
much as $2OO a week, the estimate
assumes a certain significance.
It is qualified, of course. Things
aren’t as good as they may look from
the rosy picture built up by the now
regular announcements about such-and-
such’s film or so-and-so’s new television
series (“the films are taking small
numbers for a few days’ work and a
lot of daytime TV programs don’t
always employ professional actors”).
Nevertheless, actors who a few years
ago were regaling a largely indifferent
public complaints about their
battles against artistic extinction now
have more work than they’ve had since
the end of actors’ Dream Time—the
era of the radio soap opera.
“Four years ago,” says Actors’ Equity
Hector Crawford packages
in Melbourne
All-Australian “Skippy” (left) has sold widely
overseas. Actors like Ron Haddrick (top) are
working hard in Sydney, the main scene
president Hal Alexander, “that 100
would have been down around the £2O-
--week mark, because television didn’t
take up the slack after the radio
serials were taken off.
“Actors existed with commercials,
and some industrial films were made for
conventions—a lot of actors worked in
those.”
Now the options are both contrast-
ingly numerous and more inviting. A
boom in theatre restaurants keeps
almost 100 actors permanently
employed in Sydney alone; there are
two new repertory companies, the
multi-faceted activities of the ABC,
ATN’s stock of local series, those
packaged by Hector Crawford Produc-
tions and NLT, the “Skippy” series,
“Riptide,” and the current attempts to
revive the feature-film industry.
“Two Thousand Weeks,” the only
wholly Australian effort of the four
films under way so far, has a cast of 29,
including four in principal parts, while
the Michael Powell-James Mason film,
“The Age of Consent,” with a fairly
small cast, employs seven Australian
featured players.
A larger cast of Australians will be
used in “The Drifting Avenger,” the
Japanese Toei Film Company’s East-
meets-West exercise—the most bizarre
of the cinematic happenings of the past
few months. It’s a Japanese Western to
be shot near Tamworth with four Jap-
anese actors and 23 Australians.
While it’s unlikely that any Aus-
tralian stars will be born just yet out
of our actors’ modest participation in
internationally financed films shot here,
one young actress, Penny Sugg, stands
to do well out of Goldsworthy Produc-
tions’ plan to follow “It Takes All
Kinds” with two more low-budget films
next year, and six the following year.
She has been put under contract to
appear in three of these films —the only
local player the company has signed so
far, although “It Takes All Kinds”
employed 27 Australians in featured
roles and 312 as extras. All were hired
on a daily basis, the featured actors
averaging three days’ work each, the
extras one.
“The basic Equity rate a player re-
ceives for five days’ work on the films
is $275,” a spokesman for the company
said. “But this depends on who the
actor is. It doesn’t matter about the
size of a role. An actor in a bigger
part gets no more than someone in a
small role, if they’re both being filmed
over the same amount of time. But
we are willing to pay more for actors
with bigger reputations. Rates are
negotiated individually.
“We’ve contracted Penny Sugg, be-
cause she showed a lot of promise in the
first film.”
The next, “Witness To A Killing,”
goes into production in August with a
budget increase of $130,000 over “It
Takes All Kinds” ($300,000), and the
same policy about using American stars
as insurance.
This kind of thinking also prevails on
“Riptide,” with Ty Hardin as the
resident American star, but the all-
Australian flavor of Fauna Productions’
“Skippy” doesn’t seem to have ham-
pered its success in the rest of the
world. It is being screened in Britain,
Holland, Finland, Canada, and Japan,
and has been sold in Germany, France,
Malta, Kenya, and Gibraltar, filming
of a second series of 39 episodes has
begun, and a feature film is scheduled.
In its first year of production, the
series used about 200 actors altogether,
with its average of four guest players
per episode, and the five actors who
make up the series’ regular cast—Ed
Devereux, Tony Bonner, Lisa Goddard,
Ken James, and Garry Pankhurst —are
fully employed on it.
They’ll automatically go into the
feature film, and Devereaux has become
a shareholder in Fauna Productions.
“I intend to have a share in everything
I do from now on,” he said in a recent
interview. “In every future feature
film, I will organise my contract in
such a way that I’ll be paid a certain
amount to do the film and will also
share in the profits.”
Few other Australian actors are con-
templating security in such grandiose
terms, but it is at least becoming a

Something
for
nothing!
by Peter Boxall
Eastern’s Regional Manager
Strolling through a city store this
week, I was given a free sample pack
of cigarettes. "It's not often you get
something for nothing these days,” I
mused.
Which brings me to a new idea of
Eastern’s, literally something for noth-
ing; a free sampling of the U.S.A. for
you en route to Europe via Mexico.
Let me elaborate. On Qantas' Fiesta
Service you can pick up an Eastern jet
in Mexico City or Acapulco, cross the
U.S. and rejoin a Europe-bound flight
at New York, or any other Eastern gate-
way, for no extra cost in air fare.
A typical route takes in New Orleans,
Atlanta, Baltimore and New York, with
stopovers to suit, and the VIP service
no money can buy—because Eastern
provides it with a smile for free.
Your travel agent will gladly help you
decide on a route from numerous
stopover possibilities, all packed with
individual interest.
This is Eastern's way of introducing
more and more people to more and
more of the States . . . and it’s an ideal
opportunity for you to see the U.S.A.,
at no extra air fare, on your way to
Europe. It’s not often you get some-
thing for nothing these days, so call in
and talk to your travel agent about
Eastern.
See how much better
an airline can be.

possibility in a profession which has
been without it for so long.
ATN’s new and lavish daytime series,
“Motel,” will have a cast of 17, its new
drama series about a boxer is expected
to have a regular cast of seven,
“McGooley” has six, “Mavis Bramston”
has six, the ABC’s “Contrabandits” has
five, “Bellbird,” running four nights a
week, has about a dozen, and Hector
Crawford’s “Hunter” and “Homicide”
also have casts of contracted regulars.
Some of the repertory companies pay
top salaries of $9O, augmented by the
fact that actors don’t have to face the
discomforts of touring and can sand-
wich in other daytime jobs between
rehearsals —and the theatre restaurants
offer the same freedom.

Sydney have been, appearing there for
the past five years, in productions which
enjoy a standard six-month run. “We
keep more or less a stock company,”
the theatre’s publicity officer explained.
Yet actors who survived the post-
serial slump to compare their radio
days with the current boom say the
past was more lucrative, if an actor
had the stamina.
Penny Sugg’s first
film role earned
her contracts for
three more. Syd-
ney actor Owen
Weingott is also
busy in TV,
theatre, and radio
“In those days, a topline actor
worked constantly,” says Ron Haddrick,
who is at present appearing in the
Old Tote’s season of Australian plays.
“He worked five days a week, and a
couple of nights, as well. And he
probably got ulcers into the bargain,
but he made a lot of money.”
Haddrick and other actors complain
about the amount of unpaid prepara-
tion they do for their television roles,
and at the fast pace and low cost at
which some of the daytime television
programs are produced.
“For a ‘People in Conflict’ or an
episode of ‘The Unloved,’ you go in for
a three-hour rehearsal one day, then
two days later you go straight into the
studio, run through the first segment
once, then tape it,” says Owen
Weingott, a Sydney actor who works
in theatre, radio, and television.
“You’re paid on an hourly basis for
the amount of time you spend in the
studio. And that, 5 of course, doesn’t
take into account all the work you did
at home.
“Another thing, after I’ve done an
‘Unloved,’ I’m kissed off from that
series for four months. Otherwise, the
characters just become unbelievable.
“You could theoretically do a
‘Homicide’ and a ‘Hunter’ once every
two months, although it doesn’t really
happen that way.”
Constantly juggling his opportunities
as he must, an actor often finds art and
economics incompatible, especially in
the theatre. “You don’t get paid while
you’re rehearsing a play, which means
you have to work doubly hard once the
play is running—doing film narration
and television to make up 'for the
rehearsal time when the money isn’t
coming in,” Haddrick says.
Weingott complains about employers’
unwillingness to negotiate salaries
above the basic Equity rate. “Equity
keeps trying to push the minimums up
higher, yet the higher they push them
up, the less negotiation we’re able to
do.
“All actors are being treated as if
they’re on a par, regardless of the size
of the contribution they’re making to
the production.
“There’s no philanthropic feeling
behind the proliferation of local tele-
vision. It happened because the Ameri-
cans suddenly put their prices up.
Before they did, stations here could
get world-class shows for as little as
$5O0 —shows that cost something like
$30,000 to produce. And when that
stopped, it became cheaper to make
local shows, rather than buy American
ones.
“At the moment, writers and actors
both feel they’re not getting enough
for their contributions. But the pro-
ducer, on his part, reasons that he’s
taking the risks and isn’t willing to pay
out any more.
“It’ll stabilise as we all get used to
working with the medium, and mean-
while we shouldn’t res( .it one another.”
In order to take advantage of the
developments in their profession, most
actors are finding it necessary to move
to Sydney. Although Hector Crawford
Productions are based in Melbourne,
almost everything else centres on
Sydney. Even the theatre, which used
to divide itself equally between the
capitals, has shifted its emphasis. J. C.
Williamson’s still keep their head office
in Melbourne, but first auditions are
held in Sydney, and the scene in Sydney
is so active that no actor can afford to
ignore it for long.
The odd . man out of all this is the
young actor. Parts for people under
30 arc limited, and television, the most
truthful of all media, doesn’t accept
a 25-year-old playing a 45-year-old.
Unless he makes an early name for
himself, the first years are going to be
the toughest for the young actor now
looking for a doorway into the industry.
But the signs are that the effort will
prove worth while.

What is a regular army officer?
Cadet officers want an active career out of doors and a cult of manliness and toughness grows easily among them
By AN EX-OFFICER
A former Regular discusses
the best and the worst of the
life Australia offers its
professional soldiers
WHAT KIND of man is the Regular
Army officer who fights in the jungles
of Vietnam or wherever else he is
asked to? What are his origins? How
is he trained? Most importantly, what
makes him accept assignments regard-
less of the political debate in Australia?
In a survey of the social status of
various occupations carried out at the
University of Sydney, “Regular Army
Captain” was given fairly low status by
the general community in comparison
with occupations such as engineer and
doctor. Doubtless his social status
would rise if the nation were to be-
come involved in a full-scale war such
as World War 11. However, the
Regular officer is likely to remain' “a
hero in war, forgotten in peace.”
There are historical reasons why the
Regular Army officer in Australia has
comparatively low status. Australians
have always tended to believe that
defence is important only during time
of war. After World War I the Aus-
tralian Imperial Forces were disbanded
and a citizens’ military force (a
’militia) was organised with a very
small Regular Army cadre to train
this force. Popular esteem for this cadre
was fairly low, probably because mili-
tary training requirements were not
particularly complex. World War II
was fought by forces composed mainly
of volunteers, although a volunteer who
has served for more than three years
could well be classed as a regular.
In 1949 a small Regular Army was
formed by the Labor Government.
Once again during the Korean War a
force consisting in part of inadequately
trained volunteers was sent overseas.
The inadequate' National Service
scheme of the 1950 s did nothing to
dispel the cadre concept of the Regular
soldier. The lengthened period of
National Service (two years) intro-
duced in 1965 was a victory for the
Regular Army because it was at last
recognised by the politicians that a
period of twelve 'months was required
to train a soldier adequately. In addi-
tion, the expansion of the Army after
1965 gave further impetus to the “pro-
fessional” concept of the Regular
soldier. The remaining cadre role, in
relation to the present CMF, could be
further reduced were the Government
to recognise the inadequacy of the
CMF as it at present exists.
The Regular officer’s low social
status is probably due to the nature
of the task he is involved in. He is
usually seen, especially since the Viet-
nam War, as a “professional in vio-
lence” compared to the glamorous citi-
zen soldier who is a defender of
freedom. The Regular’s social and intel-
lectual isolation from the com'munity in
general also contributes to his low
esteem by civilians.
However, the social origins of the
Regular officer probably play a very
large part in society’s assessment. Most
of them co’me from lower-middle-class
city families with added representation
from all other classes in the community,
excluding the establishments of the
capital cities and graziers’ sons. Nearly
all of them are native Australians,
with a small but increasing minority
of migrants. After the British with-
drawal from “East of Suez” the pro-
portion of Englishmen may soon in-
crease. The lesser-developed States
industrially, Queensland and Western
Australia in particular, tend to be over-
represented proportionally. A very
small percentage of officers are the
sons of professional soldiers, but to
have an officer father is certainly no
guarantee of selection for officer train-
ing.
Catholics are probably over-repre-
sented in relation to the Australian
population for two main reasons. Firstly,
the Army offers financial security for
a soldier’s family despite the hazardous
nature of the job. He knows that, no
matter what happens, his family will
be looked after. Secondly, he en-
counters no anti-Catholic bias such as
exists in business and some professions.
Broadly speaking, then, the picture
is of an individual making his way up
the social ladder.
What makes him enlist in the Army
rather than try his luck elsewhere? A
large number have already served in
the school cadets and liked the type of
life. Some were seeking financial
security. Some “always wanted to be an
Army officer.” Nearly all want an
active athletic-type career out of doors.
All have a strong belief in the neces-
sity for Armed Forces and the need
to defend Australia.
The selection procedure for officer
training is extensive and rigorous. It
takes at least two days in all and con-'
sists of interviews and outdoor tasks
involving ropes and poles, as well as a
medical examination and written
aptitude tests. The applicant 'must be
in very good condition physically, have
an IQ in the top 20 percent of the
population, and have exhibited leader-
ship potential either at school or later.
He probably has not done particularly
well at examinations due to a greater
interest in sporting activities than in
study. The selectors tend to look for
an all-rounder, who is gregarious and

a dominant personality. A large number
apply for officer training, but only a
small proportion are selected.
There are several avenues of entry
to officer rank, both from civilian life
and from the ranks of the Regular
Army. Most officers have passed
through Officer Cadet School at Port-
sea on the tip of the Mornington
Peninsula in Victoria (officer cadets
assisted in the search for the late Prime
Minister Holt’s body soon after he was
reported missing). The course at
Portsea is one year of military studies,
is extremely rigorous physically, and
contains little general educational
work.
The more leisurely four-year course
at Royal Military College at Duntroon,
near Canberra, combines military study
and university-level academic study in
arts, science, or technology. It was
co'mmonly considered that graduates
from Duntroon would automatically fill
top Army positions, but graduates from
the more recently constituted Portsea
are challenging this primacy as the
first of their graduates are attending
the Australian Army Staff College. The
future of OCS and RMC is uncertain,
as they may be amalgamated with the
RAAF Academy now at Point Cook,
on the western side of Port Phillip
Bay, and with the RAN College at
Jervis Bay, east of Canberra.
It is relatively easy for the soldier
to rise from the ranks, provided he
meets the usual requirements. Many of
the graduates fro'm Portsea have
previously served in the ranks. Other
officers have come from the CMF
officer corps and from the national
servicemen Officer Training Unit at
Scheyville, which is to the north-west
of Sydney.
The officer cadet on graduation from
a military college becomes associated
with his graduating class during the
remainder of his career. He can com-
pare his progress with his classmates’.
Their careers continually recross. How-
ever, their order in class on graduation
does not bear much relation to future
success.
During his career the officer is
required to spend some time in a
variety of positions, both command
and staff. He also spends a lot of time
attending Army courses. Consequently,
the boy who expected to spend most
of his life outdoors finds himself spend-
ing much of it at a desk. The con-
tinual rotation between jobs is supposed
to make the officer more versatile, but
some officers complain that they find
themselves doing jobs for which they
are highly unqualified.
The officer, while working, is expec-
ted to pass promotion examinations to
captain and then to major (the latter
examinations are at university-level
difficulty). Promotion examination
syllabuses tend to be re'mote from the
realities of professional life, but in this
respect they are certainly no worse
than most other professions. The
emphasis tends to be on reproduction
of rote-learned material, which is based
on the fact that the officer must be able
to think quickly under the pressure of
combat. The ARA officer is trained as
a specialist in jungle warfare and there
is no doubt that other armies could
well learn from him.
An ambitious officer attempts to
qualify to attend Army Staff College,
located at Queenscliff, across The Rip
from Portsea. The officer cadet at
Portsea can literally set his sights on
staff college, visible across Port Phillip
Bay. The six-month course at Queens-
cliff is supposed to fit the officer to
hold higher positions in the Army
hierarchy. However, there is some
cynicism over the appropriateness of
the syllabus. It is certain that most
graduates are unaware of many modern
management techniques and are defi-
cient in professional education. In the
fields of financial administration and
the psychology of training, in particular,
he is abysmally ignorant.
By the time of his graduation from
Queenscliff an officer’s reputation is
well established. From the date of his
graduation from military college he
has been the subject of annual assess-
ments of his performance as an officer.
The seniority system of promotion up
to the rank of major is still used,
and this is an archaism in a society
where there is a shortage of outstand-
ing talent. However, after attending
staff college his promotion to the rank
of lieutenant-colonel and more senior
ranks is said to be based on merit as
established by the continual assess-
ments. In fact, his chances of promotion
depend, as they do in the civilian world,
upon a variety of factors personal,
organisational, and sheer chance. A
specialist tends to have less chance of
promotion than does the generalist.
Officers from the combat arms, such
as artillery, have greater opportunities
than those from the services.
What kind of an organisation is the
Army? How does it compare with
civilian firms? It tends to be organisa-
tionally conservative. Innovation is
often difficult to introduce. The failure
to make the pentropic division work
was probably due to this conservatism,
as much as any inherent defects in the
concept itself. Likewise, military tech-
nology tends to lag behind civilian
technology by several years. The Army
could be innovatory as it has been in
the past. Army equipment has always
been its best when simple, versatile,
and reliable under a wide range of
conditions. The Willys jeep is a good
example.
What does the Regular Army officer
do during peacetime? A large amount
of his time is taken up carrying out
administrative tasks devised by civilians
in order to make the Army more like
the Public Service. The Regular soldier
complains that the Public Service tail
wags the Army dog, especially in the
fields of equipment accounting and
finance. The Regular officer also
spends some time in activities con-
nected with the community; for

The relation of the Regular Army
officer to the CMF still tends to be a
vexed one. He is expected to spend
some time being a member of the cadre
staff which supports the CMF. The
CMF member secretly believes that
the Regular is a Regular only because
he could not find a decent job in
civilian life. The Regular member
knows that the CMF member, being an
amateur, could not be as efficient as
he, a professional. This problem was
partly overcome by a recent decision
of the Military Board to apply ARA
enlistment and commissioning standards
to the CMF. However, the problem that
remains is how to train a part-time
soldier to the same standard as a full-
time soldier. Although the Military
Board allows a certain period of grace
in the event of call-up of the CMF tc
allow units to become combat ready,
it is recognised by all that these periods
of grace are unrealistically short.
To the Regular officer, the Army is
a complete style of life. It is said that
the Army acts for the serviceman in
every role except wife. If this is so, ii
has arisen because of the serviceman’s
segregation from civilian life and his
subsequent social isolation. Unfortun-
ately for both the Army officer and the
community he serves, the cantonment
idea of a closed Army community has
enjoyed vogue among Army planners.
Puckapunyal camp, in Victoria, is a
prime example of deliberate isolation of
the serviceman and his family. Some
camps are, therefore, a male confra-
ternity plus dependents, a few service-
women and civilian employees. The
servicewomen usually occupy clerical
and related occupations. The public
servants are tolerated provided they
sympathise with the serviceman’s special
problems. Finally, the long hours which
most Regular officers work tend to
isolate them further.
Like most people, the Regular officer
believes he is underpaid. No one has
ever produced any conclusive evidence
as to whether he is or not. From
personal observation I believe that,
while on non-combat duty, junior and
field officers are probably adequately
paid. Above the rank of lieutenant-
colonel, like his Public Service counter-
part, he is poorly paid compared to
similar positions in industry.
However, when it comes to combat
duty he is woefully underpaid. The
problem is how to assess a man’s worth
in the face of possible death and how
to pay him adequately. It is well known
that the casualty rate is usually higher
in the infantry corps, but no extra
allowances are paid for infantry service.
To my mind there is no doubt that
allowances for combat duty must be
paid along the lines of the U.S. Army.
To pay British-style allowances is in-
congruous when our soldiers are far
more likely to fight alongside American
soldiers than British soldiers.
Social life is regulated fairly heavily
by Army protocol, which does not dis-
tinguish clearly the official and private
spheres. The officer is expected to
behave appropriately at all times in all
social situations. Rules are laid down
about dress and etiquette. (Hair is to
be kept short.) Mess life tends to be
formal and clublike.
Regular officers tend to be strong
family men by inclination. However,
frequent separations from wives and
children can strain family stability. In
addition, the chronic shortage of suit-
able Army married quarters in certain
areas places an unfair strain on a man
already placed in a difficult situation.
As to be expected, officers tend to
marry wives from the same social class
as themselves. It is commonly said that
wives marry the Army as well as their
husbands. Wives’ social participation is
usually limited to meeting other
officers’ wives, and much conversation is
devoted to Army matters such as post-
ings. Their main task in life is to
manage the details of family life and
be prepared to move often. Overseas
postings such as Malaya, where servants
are available, compensate for the worst
postings back' in Australia.
Most officers tend to spend most of
their recreation with their families, car-
washing, and lawn-mowing, as do other
suburban Australian males. Heavy
drinking is probably more common,
often due to the cantonment nature of
many Army camps and separations.
Few of them read much or at a high
level. Television and newspapers are
their main sources of information. Few
speak foreign languages (other than
those who attended the foreign-
languages school at Point Cook). Their
general cultural level is lower than
officers from the British and the United
States Armies.
The officer lacks a passionate inter-
est in political objectives in a war. He
tends to be detached and sceptical. At
the same time he is usually well
informed on “current affairs,” which
are required study in promotion
examinations. At elections he usually
votes Liberal in the unfounded belief
that the ALP would reduce the size
of the Army. He has an interest in the
mechanics of politics but tends to be
naive about the real nature of political
activity.
It _is more than social habits or
training which make the Regular Army
officer; he has a set of beliefs, articula-
ted or unconscious, which shape and
are shaped by his behaviour. He
accepts the logic of war and considers
pacifism self-evidently unworkable. He
believes in a cult of manliness and
toughness. He has a desire for military
activity rather than war per se, which
he may see as an unfortunate con-
comitant of military activity.
However, it is his dedication to his
profession which sets the Regular Ar'my
officer apart. He is a technocrat dedica-
ted to the efficacy of the Army and
he tends to be mildly distrustful of
those not as dedicated as himself. He
fights because it is his career commit-
ment to fight. He says proudly, “I am
a professional soldier.”


What’s wrong
with us?
ARTHUR KOESTLER ventures a new diagnosis
of the human predicament and "the
unholy mess we have made of our history /#
IF ONE looks with a cold eye at the
mess man has made of his history,
it is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that he is afflicted by some built-in
mental disorder which drives him
toward self - destruction. We know
that among social ani'mals fighting is a
ritual which stops short of serious
injury. The prey that the predator kills
always belongs to a different species.
Murder within the species, on an indi-
vidual or collective scale, is a phen-
omenon unknown in the whole animal
kingdom, except for man and a few
varieties of ants and rats.
Evidently something must have gone
wrong at some point in the evolution of
homo sapiens. But when we &sk what
it is that has gone wrong, we usually
get the dusty answer that all evil stems
from the selfish, greedy, aggressive ten-
dencies in human nature. That is the
explanation that has been offered to us
for the past 3000 years by Hebrew
prophets, Indian sages, Christian moral-
ists, and contemporary psychoanalysts;
but, speaking in all humility, I find this
answer unconvincing and unsupported
by the historical record.
What the record indicates is that, in
the major disasters in our history, indi-
vidual aggressiveness of selfish motives
played an almost negligible part com-
pared to unselfish loyalty and devotion
to tribe, nation, religion, or political
ideology. Tribal wars, national wars,
civil wars, religious wars, world wars
are waged in the purported interest of
the community, not of the individual, to
decide issues that are far removed from
the personal self-interest of the com-
batants. No doubt the lust for rape and
plunder provided delightful incentives
for a minority, but for the great maj-
ority the primary motive was fanatical
loyalty, to the point of self-sacrifice, to
Icing and country, leader or group.
In other words, the main trouble with
man appears to °be not that he is an
excessively aggressive creature but an
excessively loyal and devoted creature.
He seems to have a stronger biological
need than any other species to belong,
to attach himself to a person, a group,
or idea, to transcend the claustrophobic
confines of his self. He cannot live
alone and he cannot leave alone.
One possible reason for this tendency
may be the protracted helplessness and
dependence of the human infant An-
other reason may be the increased de-
pendence on solidarity and co-operation
of our primate ancestors when they took
from the forest to the plains and turned
into carnivorous hunters of prey bigger
and faster than themselves. Primate
societies living in the wild are also held
together by strong bonds, and groups of
the same primate species living in dif-
ferent localities may also develop dif-
ferent traditions and customs. But the
cohesive bonds within pri'mate families
do not grow into neurotic attachments,
the cohesive forces within primate

Copenhagen recently accepting the

Russell, and Sir Laurence Olivier.
groups do not attain the intensity and
fervor of tribal feeling, and the differ-
ences between primate groups of the
same species do not lead to violent
conflicts. Only in homo sapiens did the
cohesive forces within the group develop
into fanatical loyalty to tribe, totem,
and its later symbolic equivalents; and
only in our species did the repellent
forces between groups develop into
intra-specific warfare.
What I am trying to suggest is that
the aggressive, self-assertive tendencies
in the emotional life of the human
individual are less dangerous to the
species than his self-transcending or
integrative tendencies. Most civilisations
throughout our history have been quite
successful in taming individual aggres-
siveness and teaching the young how
to sublimate their self-assertive im-
pulses. But we have tragically failed to
achieve a similar sublimation and
canalisation of the self-transcending
emotions.
The number of victims of individual
crimes committed in any period of
history is insignificant compared to the
masses cheerfully sacrificed ad majorem
gloriam, in blind devotion to the true
religion, dynasty, or political system.
When we speak of “blind devotion” we
implicitly recognise the uncritical
nature of the self-transcending urge in
forming attachments to a person, group,
race, flag, or system of beliefs.
Every man is an island, craving to
become attached to the mainland—or
an atom with a free valency in search
of chemical bond. A privileged minority
may achieve self-transcendence through
the “oceanic feeling” of the mystic, or
the cathartic experiences mediated by
the pursuit of science and art. But
history shows that for the vast majority
of mankind the only outlet for this
longing to belong is a primitive form
of identification with a social group
and with the system of beliefs which
it represents.
There is an essential difference be-
tween such primitive identification and
the mature forms of social integration.
Integration preserves the autonomy
and responsibility of the individual in
the social whole; identification implies
a partial or total sacrifice of both, a
surrender of the critical faculties and
of moral responsibility. In some respects
it represents a regression to infancy
or even to the “womb” of the Church,
as the saying goes; in other respects it
resembles the hypnotic rapport; in
extreme cases it produces the phenom-
ena of mass hysteria in overt or latent
form. One need not be physically pres-
ent in a crowd to be affected by crowd

mentality; it permeates the whole intel-
lectual climate, like radioactive fallout,
even in the privacy of one’s bathroom.
Thus during most of human history
the self-transcending urges of the indi-
vidual could only express themselves
through devotion to a narrowly defined
group, with which he identified
himself to the hostile exclusion of other
groups; as a result, the disruptive forces
have always dominated the forces of
cohesion in our species as a whole.
The main peril of self-transcending
devotion is that it frequently acts as
a vehicle for a vicarious, unselfish kind
of aggression. We enter into an identi-
ficatory rapport with the hero on the
movie screen, and as a result hate the
perfidious villain; our anger is a
vicarious emotion experienced ,on
behalf of another person who does not
even really exist, and yet we produce
all the physical symptoms of a true
emotion. Similarly, the emotion dis-
played by a crowd of demonstrators is
an unselfish type of emotion derived
from the identification of the individual
with the group.
When alone, man is inclined to act in
his own interest, regardless of others;
when identified with a group, the situa-
tion is reversed. The egotism of the
group feeds on the altruism of its
members.
Human history is pockmarked with
the scars of this infernal dialectic. As
to its origins, some clues are perhaps
provided by the biological factors pre-
viously mentioned—the long infantile
dependence and strong social inter-
dependence characteristic of our species.
There is also the peculiar ability of
the human brain to sustain belief-
systems, rooted in emotion, which are
incompatible and in frequent conflict
with its reasoning faculties. The result
is the split-minded, quasi-schizophrenic
mentality which seems to be inherent
in man’s condition and is reflected in
his absurd and tortured history.
Let me mention briefly two further
factors which seem to be equally basic
to the human predicament. The first is
the emergence of language as an exclu-
sively human blessing and curse.
Language promotes communication and
understanding within the group; but it
also accentuates the differences in tradi-
tion and beliefs between groups, and
erects separative barriers between tribes,
nations, regions, social classes. Accord-
ing to Margaret Mead, among the two
million aborigines in New Guinea, 750
different languages and dialects were
spoken in 750 villages, which used to
be at permanent war with one another.
Even more dangerous, however, than
the divisive effect of different vocabu-
laries is the power of language to
crystallise the implicit habits and ways
of life of different communities into
explicit doctrines and moral impera-
tives. If the citizens of Lilliput had
not been blessed \vith language, they
could not have fought a war on the
question on which end to break the egg,

because they would not have been able
to transform a habit into an ideology.
Equal in importance to the discovery
of language and of the use of tools is
man’s discovery of death. But we should
rather say: the discovery of death by
the intellect and its rejection by instinct.
Instinct takes existence for granted and
cannot conceive of non-existence. The
refusal to accept death as a natural and
final phenomenon became a dominant
motive in all human cultures, and a
paradigm of the split mind. It popu-
lated the atmosphere with invisible
presences, most of them malevolent or
at least capricious and unpredictable,
who had to be propitiated and appeased
at a heavy price.
The institution of human sacrifice is
a phenomenon curiously neglected by
anthropologists, although it is found in
every part of the world at the dawn
of civilisation, and even at the height
of pre-Columbian cultures. It is epito-
mised in one of the early chapters of
Genesis, where Abraham prepares to
cut the throat of his son out of sheer
love of God. The übiquity of human
sacrifice is one of the earliest manifes-
tations of the paranoid trend in the
human psyche. The forms changed, but
the trend persisted throughout the holy
massacres of history, culminating in the
genocidal enterprises of our time. Even
the promise of eternal life was offered
only to a small minority of mankind,
at the price of eternal torment for the
vast majority. Paradise was an exclusive
country club, but the gates of hell were
open to all.
There is, of course, a reverse side
of the medal. Devotion is not always
misguided, language produced the
treasures in our libraries, the discovery
of death is the foundation on which
pyramids and cathedrals were built.
However, we are now concerned not
with the glory of man but his predica-
ment, and today that is the more urgent
subject; it has achieved an urgency as
never before. History is accelerating at
an unprecedented rate, like the mole-
cules of a liquid that is coming to the
boil.
The contemporary equivalent of the
Writing on the Wall are the diagram-
matic charts of the exponential curves,
representing the various explosions that
surround us: population explosion,
knowledge explosion, communications
explosion, and the explosion of explo-
sive power. We may have seen these
curves in learned magazines, but none
of us has seen a curve representing
progress in theoretical and applied
ethics. The reason is presumably that
there is no progress to report since the
days when Buddha sat under the ban-
yan tree, waiting for his oxcart.
In contrast to the exponential curve,
which shows at first a slow, then an
ever steeper rise until it seems to
rocket into the sky, the missing ethical
curve would show a blurred, wavy line
with inconclusive ups and downs, and
would never get off the ground. This

contrast provides us with a simple over-
all view of our history; it reflects the
consequences of the split mind.
Evolution proceeds by trial and
error, so we ought not to be surprised
if it turned out that there is some
construction fault in the circuitry that
we carry inside our skulls, which would
explain the unholy mess we have made
of our history. The ultimate cause may
be the exceptionally rapid growth of
the hominid brain in the course of the
past half-million years a phenomenon
which seems to be unique in evolution.
The brain explosion in the second
half of the Pleistocene seems also to
have followed the exponential curve
which has become so familiar to us—
and there may be more than a super-
ficial analogy here, as both curves
reflect the phenomenon of the accelera-
tion of history on different levels. But
explosions rarely produce harmonious
results, and the evidence seems to indi-
cate that in our case the result is
insufficient co-ordination between the
phylogenetically old areas of the brain
and the new, specifically human areas
of the neocortex, which were super-
imposed on it with unseemly haste.
A distinguished neurophysiologist,
Professor Paul Mac Lean, has coined the
term “schizophysiology” for this dis-
orderly state of affairs in our central
nervous system. While our intellectual
functions are carried on in the newest
and most highly developed part of the
brain, he says, our effective behaviour
continues to be dominated by a rela-
tively crude and primitive system, by
archaic structures in the brain whose
fundamental pattern has undergone but
little change in the whole course of
evolution from mouse to man.
The consequences of this built-in
schizophysiology range from so-called
normal behaviour, where emotional bias
distorts our reasoning only within
tolerable limits, through neurotic and
psychotic disorder in the individual, to
the collectively held beliefs in irrational
causes to w'hich w'e are emotionally
committed in blind devotion and
militant enthusiasm.
The question is, as Bertrand Russell
once said, how to persuade humanity to
acquiesce in its own survival. The
thermonuclear reaction, once invented,
cannot be disinvented, and the Pandora
boxes of biological warfare are just
waiting to be opened. One cannot play
Russian roulette for long.
The biological evolution of man
seems to have come to a standstill, at
least since Cro-Magnon days; since we
cannot in the foreseeable future expect
a change in human nature to arise by a
spontaneous mutation, our only hope
seems to be to discover techniques
w'hich supplant biological evolution and
provide a cure for our collective ail-
ments. Recent advances in the sciences
of life seem to indicate that once man
decides to take his fate into his owm
hands, that possibility will be within
his reach.


BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
Our best customer’s health
HOW THAT the Japanese captains
of industry and kings of commerce are
departing from their week or so of
talks in Australia on co-operation (and
a bit of business, too), the realities of
Australia’s close links with Japan are
even more apparent. So, too, is the
extent of Australian dependence on
the continuing health of the Japanese
economy. But how healthy is Japan
(quite apart from the threat that
exists to all trading countries if the
world money situation is not solved
permanently fairly soon)?
At present Japan is going through a
period of balance-of-payments prob-
lems. Last year (the 12 months that
ended in March, 1968) the Japanese
balance of payments suffered a $U.5.700
million deficit; next year, as a result
of restrictive measures now being taken
on the internal economy, particularly
on consumer demand, this deficit is
expected to be cut in half but it
will still be a deficit, even though it
will not be a very large one in the
context of Japan’s existing overseas
reserves of $U.5.1900 million or so.
This deficit is not due to any failure
of exports to match imports; the trade
surplus of $U.5.1200 million in 1967-
68 was only turned into a balance-of-
payments deficit by the $U.5.1430 mil-
lion payment made for “invisible” im-
ports like insurance and freight and
for a $U.5.470 million outflow of capi-
tal. Next year the trade surplus is
expected to improve to $U.5.2000 mil-
lion, giving a current account surplus
of $U.5.600 million, which will be offset
by a big rise of $950 million in the net
capital outflow.
(Japan is keen to expand its over-
seas investments and one of the points
made at the Australian meetings by
Japanese businessmen was that they ex-
pected more joint ventures here with
Australian companies.)
There seems little doubt about
Japan’s capacity to increase its exports
like this; its 32 percent increase in in-
vestment in capital equipment last year
and its 20 percent rise in manufacturing
production at a time when consumer
spending rose at about 15 percent in-
dicates a clear scope for mounting ex-
ports, particularly as Government re-
straints (through higher interest rates
and limits on bank lending) will hold
back the consumer sector this year.
But these anti-inflationary measures
will also almost halve the rate of
growth in Japanese gross national pro-
duct from last year’s 13.7 percent to
7 percent. For the future, Japanese
forecasters expect an average annual
rate of growth in real gross national
product of between 8 and 10 percent
during the next decade, so that by
1977 Japanese GNP in real terms will
have doubled. As the Melbourne brok-
ing house of lan Potter and Co. says
in its latest circular: “These are heart-
ening signs for the Australian investor
in raw materials stocks that are supply-
ing the Japanese market” even
though this' year’s rate of growth is
so severely reduced.
What does all this mean for Aus-
tralia? The Potter circular says: “It
means that with strong growth pros-
pects the Japanese must continue to
.require our raw materials and that
Australian-Japanese trading links must
grow closer. The Japanese will make
every effort to expand their export
trade and fill the ‘technological gaps’
in the Australian manufacturing sector,
for example in electronics. This will
be done through a variety of ways,
joint ventures in manufacturing, and
through direct exports. It means that
a rising standard of living in Japan
could well result in increased Japanese
demand for certain of our agricultural
commodity exports such as meat. It
could also lead to some restraint of
the competitive ability of Japanese
manufacturers if inflation as reflected in
the rise of the consumer price index
is allowed to increase too rapidly.
(The latest forecast for the index in
1968-69 is plus 6.1 percent.) Also it
means that both countries must, in their
own interest, develop close commercial
relations in order to jointly participate
in the gradual awakening of the vast
S.E. Asian market.”
Qantas
Freighter war
THE BIG headlines about Qantas were
of the great, square office blocks it
plans to plant (at a cost of $lB million)
as its new headquarters on the site of
its old Wentworth Hotel in Sydney.
But the really big news about Qantas
as an airline was the small item re-
porting the immediate start of a cargo
jet freighter service to London via Asia
and Europe.
Until the weekend’s flight, Qantas
had been out of the freighter business
to Britain ever since it made a boo-
boo eight years ago by converting old
super Constellations into freighters
after replacing them with jets on its
passenger routes. Freight clients did
not take to the scheme at all; it was
days quicker to get their freight loaded
into the cargo holds of a jet than to
go by the all-freighter piston-driven
Constellations. After a while the project
folded.
Then, at the beginning of this month,
Qantas started the first transpacific
freighter, providing a once-a-week- ser-
vice, leaving Sydney on Friday nights
and leaving San Francisco the same
day (thanks to the date line) on the
return trip. It used an all-cargo Boeing
707/338C aircraft (the big one) that
it could convert to passenger use for the
rest of the week. The service signifi-
cantly increased the sorts of goods,
particularly on pallets, that could be
sent by air freight, as the aircraft can
carry 35 tons of bulky cargo, even in-
cluding motor-cars, and Qantas began
Qantas ... new Sydney headquarters
a big advertising campaign to promote
the idea.
But only four days after the first
Qantas Pacific freighter flight, BOAG
jumped in to announce that it was
planning to introduce the first jet
freighters on to the Kangaroo route
to London, and that they would go
into service in October (also with
338 Cs), providing two services a week
from Sydney, on Mondays and Fri-
days, and from London on Wednes-
days and Saturdays, calling at Darwin,
Hong Kong, Calcutta, Dubai, Frank-
furt, and Bahrain or Kuwait. Said
BOAC’s sales manager John Ward-
ropper: “The rapid growth in the use
of air freight between Britain and Aus-
tralia has made it obvious to BOAC.
that aircraft entirely devoted to this
type of business are necessary on this
important route. The large capacity of
these giant freighters will be a great
help to exporters and importers of


large machinery, computers, and indus-
trial equipment. They will be capable
of carrying consignments up to 80ft. in
length.”
Qantas came straight back into the
fight; two days later, without any
preliminary drum-beating, it announced
it was “extending” its jet cargo
freighter service (by then only one
week old) to London via Asia and
Europe on the following day, Friday.
And that it would run a twice-a-week
service on Fridays and Tuesdays. This
means that when BOAC get their two
on the route, jet freighters will be
going to London on Monday and Tues-
day, with two on Fridays (the most
popular day for air freight).
What was not so evident from the
Qantas announcement was that the
new freighter service to Britain would
not take up the whole aircraft as in
the Pacific flight, but would allow for
about half the normal passenger space;
instead of the 70 tons a week that
two full freighters would provide, the
service will accommodate 32 tons a
week of cargo on the passenger decks
(which still gives it all the freighter
benefits of palletisation and bulky
loads). Nevertheless, it is a significant
move; it was not so long ago that the
airlines were wondering how they would
fill the big cargo holds of the Boeings,
let alone thinking about putting cargo
in the passenger cabins.
And there are reports that Qantas
is now keen to buy a huge air freighter,
the Lockheed L5OO, which will be able
to carry 140 tons of cargo non-stop for
3500 miles, when they are available in
1971 or so. Lockheed claim that this
aircraft, the civilian version of the CSA
Galaxy, the world’s biggest aircraft,
will push air-freight costs down to two
cents a ton-mile, presenting shipping
with a real challenge.
MEN AND MATTERS
SINCE THE future of nickel is the
future of stainless-steel it comes as
something of a welcome reassurance
in these heady days of the nickel boom
to learn that Australia’s largest pro-
ducer of stainless and other special
steels, the 85 percent owned BHP sub-
sidiary Commonwealth Steel, is' also
planning a big bright future for itself.
A $l2 million revamp and expansion
scheme has been carried out at the
company’s Waratah, Newcastle, plant
over' the past three years; the U.S.
business consultants Cresap, McCor-
mick and Paget have been and gone
to leave a streamlined management set-
up as from May 1 this year; and a $lO
million expansion program for the
Unanderra, Port Kembla, works is now
under review, to include cold rolling
and finishing facilities of stainless-steel
sheet up to 60 inches wide a product
which can be turned out at present by
about- three companies in the world.
Heading the new management team
is Desmond Wittwer, who, at 41, is two
years younger than the average age of
his fellow executives. He has been in
Douglas Travers
Desmond Wittwer
the BHP fold for 25 years, as a tech-
nical trainee in 1943, a draftsman at
the Whyalla shipyards in 1950, shipyard
superintendent in 1958, and then an
increasingly rapid ascent through the
positions of naval architect and ship-
yard manager to a brief period as Sir
lan McLennan’s personal assistant in
Melbourne before coming to temporary
rest again as managing director of
Comsteel late in 1966.
Wittwer sees the recent management
structure shake-up at Comsteel as the
key to the company’s future expansion
and success. The changes were made
to achieve higher standards of planning,
control, and communication through an
overall policy of direct accountability,
direct responsibility, and direct
authority. At Comsteel, initiative is no
lost or lamented ideal, but the basic
assumpton on which the entire structure
of the firm has been re-erected.
One of the most immediate calls on
initiative is in the court of Douglas
Travers, who joined Comsteel in 1962,
and is now the new marketing manager.
Following the recent expansions, Com-
steel’s capacity is in t the region of
140,000 tons a year; current production
is approaching 90,000 tons a year.
Faced with this excess capacity,
Travers is throwing much energy into
exports, which ,at the moment account
for 10 percent of Comsteel’s sales, even
if it means paring profit margins.
But about half the current sales are
accounted for by stainless and it is in
this field that Travers foresees good
prospects for the biggest sales expan-
sion, for, as he points out, consumption
of stainless per capita in the U.S. is
1\ times that in Australia. It is a
question of opening up new markets by
popularising new applications. And
that, coupled with the company’s pros-
pective stainless expansion at Unan-
derra adds up to one of the few econ-
omically sound realities of Australia’s
current nickel scene.
PRINCE PHILIP, while out here for
the Commonwealth Study Conference,
will have the last say as to who gets
his prize for the top original Austra-
lian design being given by the Industrial
Design Council of Australia which the
late Essington Lewis, in one of his
many acts of industrial wisdom, was
mainly responsible for getting off the
ground ten years ago. HRH won’t pro-
nounce his verdict until May 31 in
Melbourne, but before then the lion’s
share of the job of selection from the
93 submissions will have been done by
half a dozen interstate notables in
fields ranging from university adminis-
tration and industrial designing through
to industry, architecture, and retailing
in the streets of Adelaide. The uni-
versities will be covered by Ross
Hohnem, secretary of the ANU, who
will be deputy chief judge, and Sir
Robert Blackwood, Chancellor of
Mcnash, general manager of Dunlop,
and former Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at Melbourne University.
The industrial designer concerned is
Adrian Knapp, of Sydney, who was
one of this country’s first industrial
designers and has been nominated by
the Industrial Design Institute of Aus-
tralia. The Institute of Production En-
gineers has called on lan Fullerton,
Brisbane manager of Mclllwraith
Industries, and the Royal Australian
Institute of Architecture has named
Walter Bunning, the architect of the
National Library in Canberra, as its
man. And just to emphasise what the
Industrial Design Council is purporting
to do in this essentially practical exer-
cise, lan Hayward, joint manager
director of Adelaide retailer John Mar-
tin, is also in the line-up as represent-
ing the Australian Institute of Manage-
ment. If these fellows can’t manage to
agree —and this looks highly likely
judging by their manifold interests and
the Catholip selection of submissions —
at the finish HRH will have to cut a
caper of his own, which won’t come
amiss to him.
Trade
Pulling up socks
THE ROAD ahead for Anglo-Austra-
lian trade has always looked downhill
for us, what with Britain obsessed with
its chances in Europe and the latter’s
agricultural industries ready to cut into
our British markets on a signal from
Brussels. But Britain has never con-
ceded the fact that the re-orienting of
our export markets in northerly direc-
tions held dire implications for its ex-
ports to Australia. We have, in fact,
been taken for granted on a sort of
trade-follows-the-flag notion and the
idea that with so much built-in invest-
ment in its branches and subsidiaries
here Britain has secured itself in-
definitely a rising flow of orders for
its raw material and components
supply and for their fixed investment
needs. With a margin of preference

tion) British manufacturers have never
had it so good.
But instead of redoubling their
efforts in these propitious circum-
stances (made all the more so by our
putting the rod to Japanese backs)
some of their exporters, apparently,
have lapsed further into lethargy. At
least that’s the view of the chairman
of the British National Export Council,
Sir Derek Pritchard, who last week
accused many of them of failing to
maintain proper standards in meeting
orders from Australia. He advised such
laggards in the British trade drive: “If
you can’t pull your socks up and do
better, get out and leave the market
to those who can do the job properly”
else a prejudice be created against all
British firms.
Yes, even if we want to see sterling
strong, Australia doesn’t owe Britain a
living. Sir Derek seemed to be talking
in that spirit. He is looking for a re-
surgence of Britain’s industrial strength
once it “breaks out of the cage in
which the economy has been pacing up
and down for the past twenty years or
more,” with concomitant searching for
new trade and investment opportunities
in Australia. Neglect of proper stan-
dards for and attention to the Aus-
tralian market now could imperil that
further prospect.
By the same token Sir Derek thought
that Australian exporters appeared to
be neglectful of the British market and
he advised us to send more trade mis-
sions there rather than to regard our
export trade with Britain as a lost
cause. This criticism should be taken
seriously here. Even if Britain does go
into the Common Market, that coun-
try will still be the best springboard
to hand for developing our export
trade with Europe.
Superannuation
The Downing plan
IT IS A BIT difficult to decide what
the Institute of Public Affairs likes least
about the implications it, sees for the
economy in Professor R. I. Downing’s
proposal for a contributory national
superannuation scheme. Under the
Downing Plan, income on retirement
would be governed by past earnings
(adjusted upwards for changes in
average earnings through the com-
munity). A maximum income of $53
a week would be paid to all married
couples whose past inco’mes averaged
$BO or over. Couples with past incomes
lower than $BO would receive a retire-
ment income of $4O. The scheme would
be financed by a 6J percent levy on
employers’ payrolls to yield $BOO mil-
lion a year, with employees contribut-
ing on a graduated scale to a maximum
four percent at earnings of $BO a week
and over to yield another $4OO million.
One of the things worrying the IPA,
which is more abhorrent of high taxa-
tion—even that of a transfer income
nature —than most of us, is that, on
its calculation, the sche'me would in-
volve an increase of 25 percent in
taxation. It also objects that the scheme
would push the proportion of cash
benefits to GNP here higher than in
practically any other country, that is
to about 11 percent. Its final big ob-
jection is that it would divert re-
sources into consumption and away
from growth and development.
These objections apart, the IPA
thinks we should forget about the idea
and concentrate on removing the
pockets of poverty that still exist, such
as: “the chronically ill, deserted wives,
some elderly people paying rent, and
large low-income families,” instead of
thinking of providing benefits “for those
who don’t really need them and are
able to look after themselves.” More
than anything else, however, before
encouraging industry to shirk the
responsibility for urgent social benefits
reform, we must have a full-scale
inquiry into the needs of the com-
munity, to get the real facts over the
whole national canvas. With that in
hand and if it is shown that substan-
tial sums are required from industry
to correct the position, industrialists
would face up to it with a song in their
hearts, we hope.
Business visitors
Now for the French
AUSTRALIA has turned suddenly
beautiful in foreign eyes. It is not even
winter in the northern hemisphere (the
only time we ever get a visit, usually)
and the businessmen are still pouring
in. This month we’ve had the Ameri-
cans on a Commerce Department-Pan
American trade mission; the Japanese
(two planeloads of top men) for various
conferences, delegations to the Pacific
Basin Economic Co-operation Commis-
sion, and now the French are coming.
Next month a 26-man French trade
mission led by M. Rene Sergent, chair-
man of the Franc-Sterling Committee,
will visit Australia, representing ten of
the nation’s biggest banks and 15 of
its largest industrial organisations. So
it looks as if investment as well as in-
creased trade is in French minds.
Already the mission has been pretty
thoroughly briefed in Paris for its 31
weeks in Australia.
Beating this mission to the gun this
month have been two visits by leading
French bankers on their own account;
the chairman, general manager, and
assistant general manager of the Banque
Nationale de Paris (M. Henry Bizot, M.
Pierre Ledoux, and M. J. Jean Dromer)
were here early this month, and the
chairman and international manager
of the Credit Commercial de France

Roquefeuil) have just completed a
four-day visit.
These two are big guns. The Banque
Nationale de Paris is among the big-
gest “non Anglo-Saxon” banks in the
world and is certainly the biggest in the
Common Market, with representation
in 50 countries, and is particularly in-
volved in the Pacific area. It has been
financing a large slice of the Australian
wool trade for years, but now is direct-
ing its interests more into financing
French industries in Australia. There
is some scope for this despite the Aus-
tralian Government’s refusal (re-
affirmed by Mr. McMahon last week
to an impressive gathering of Japanese
and American bankers) to allow foreign
banks to operate branches in Australia.
The Credit Commercial de France
men did not confine their discussions to
bankers; they were just as interested
in the banking “fringe” of finance and
hire-purchase companies where several
foreign banks have set up in business
with local partners in recent years.
U.S. capital
Controls to go?
A STRONG campaign by American
business to get rid of governmental
restraints on capital investment over-
seas is to begin in earnest this month
at a convention of the American
Bankers’ Association. Removal of these
restraints would be of major signifi-
cance to Australia, not only as a stimu-
lant increasing our capital inflow but
also to halt the mounting numbers of
U.S.-owned corporations that have
been raiding the local capital market.
The campaign was set off a couple
of weeks ago by the Chase Manhattan
Bank (the Rockefeller bank), which
complained that these controls “do not
solve the balance-of-payments prob-
lems” and that their continuation would
produce “a downward spiral of world
trade.” And according to large num-
bers of American international corpora-
tions the downward spiral has already
started, as U.S. corporations’ growth
overseas has been substantially slowed.
Their argument runs that the short-
term benefits to the U.S. balance of
payments by restrictions on investment
overseas will be more than offset in
the long term as their effects on the
growth and profitability of U.S. over-
seas-owned corporations are reflected
in a reduced ability to repatriate profits.
Increasing numbers of U.S. business
leaders are reported to be making
removal of these controls a condition
for financial support to this year’s
Presidential campaigns by the leading
contenders. The vice-president of one
large international corporation has been
quoted as saying: “The price for sup-
port of any candidate this year is a
pledge to remove foreign-investment
restrictions immediately upon assump-
tion of office next January.”

LET'S HELP JAPAN INTO
AUSTRALIA'S
CAPITAL-GOODS MARKET
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IN PLAYING the tariff issues cool and
getting down to the brass trade-tacks
of the large captive markets for British
and U.S. exports to Australia, the
Japan-Australian business talks in Can-
berra last week made a lot more sense
than any previous ones. The path for
more Japanese sales of capital-type
goods has not been cleared, by any
means, but at least there is now a better
mutual understanding of the main block
to them and of why Japan has neces-
sarily had to clash headlong with Aus-
tralian manufacturers if it was going to
make progress in its penetration of the
Australian market as a whole.
Given the present large captive areas
of the market for Britain and the U.S.,
for its part Japan is only too fully
aware that unless something gives in
that area the only way for it to increase
its share of our capital-goods market
is to establish its own captive sources
of demand, that is, to get more goods
here under the heady title of “direct
investment in companies,” one to which
Custom Department officials are likely
to make a more generous response when
considering by-law entry treatment
(that is, duty waivers) than to such
goods exported to Australia, to the non-
affiliated business arena by Japan, and,
for that matter, non-aligned firms from
Britain, the U.S., or anywhere else. The
federal director of the ACM, Mr. R.
W. C. Anderson, referred last week to
the fact that 76 percent of Australian
imports came in duty free and that
Japanese exports were largely left to
compete in the non-captive areas of the
Australian market where all too often
they clashed headlong with Australian
manufacturers.
The gentlemen at the British High
Commission know this better than any-
body else, or at least they should, even
if they don’t advertise the fact, when
trying to justify the retention of
imperial preferences. Until Japan man-
ages to establish its own captive markets
for capital goods here, as Britain and
to a lesser extent the U.S. have done so
successfully over the years, its penetra-
tion of them, at least in the private
sector, is bound to be slower than its
adverse balance of payments with Aus-
tralia warrants. In any case, and
especially in the light of the large area
of our capital-goods market from which
it is virtually excluded by the British
and U.S. hold, the very least we should
do, if only to ensure the continued
expansion of our exports to Japan, is
to put allcomers on an equal tariff
footing.
Sir Paul Chambers, retiring chair-
man of ICI, gave all the clues needed
for anybody who wasn’t aware of all
Sir Paul Chambers
R. W. C. Anderson
this, in Melbourne last week, when he
said that: “We could show in ICI the
extent to which investment overseas has
expanded ICI at home.” Here he may
have been thinking more of the supply
of industrial, chemical, and textile
materials from ICl’s factories in Bri-
tain to ICIANZ its subsidiary here
than of the supply of plant and
equipment. But materials, components,
plant, or what you will, in some
measure the expansion of ICI and a
multitude of other firms in Britain
derives from the group’s captive orders
from ICIANZ. Nor, of course, is ICI
an isolated case. A multitude of British
branches and subsidiaries operating
here achieve the same sort of trade
fertilisation and hence growth for their
parent and other group companies in
Britain. Naturally, the use of established
trade rather than capital links with
other group companies accounts for
most of it at present when the curbs
on direct investment from Britain to
Australia have drastically reduced its
flow.
Sir Paul Chambers left no doubt
about the importance to Britain of
getting direct investment to Australia
going again. He saw it as “seed corn”
for the generation of Britain’s exports
of machinery and semi-manufactured
goods. However, from what he said,
Britain’s restrictions on such investment
are not likely to be relaxed for some
time. The more immediate question for
him seemed to be whether curbs on
portfolio investment would also be
imposed.
Private British investors are still
pouring money into Australian stocks
and shares and it is anybody’s guess
what this is costing Britain’s balance of
payments. The sum must be a heavy
drag in the uphill climb toward the
distant plateau of external surplus.
Clearly it is being permitted to run
on in the hope of eventual return of at
least a good part of it swollen by sub-
stantial capital profits. Sir Paul
Chambers seemed to think it would
only be stopped if Britain’s external
situation became desperate, while last
week’s “Economist” suggested another
sterling crisis could be just around the
corner, and gold speculators seemed to
agree. In Sir Paul’s view this could
happen in the next five or six months
(he is not looking for much improve-
ment in the balance of payments before
October or November). However, when
ultimately confidence returns to Britain,
so also, he thought, would be a lot of
the portfolio investment here: “There
would be a turning back by many
investors to the British market.”
With the international monetary
situation still in a high state of flux
it seems unlikely that lasting confidence
in Britain’s position is going to improve
overnight or indeed for a year at least
—the “Economist” has even been asking
whether Mr. Wilson’s head is worth the
price of another devaluation. In the
interim and if they are allowed to
British investors seem likely to keep
pouring money into our markets and
would hardly be tempted to repatriate
it if another sterling devaluation should
ensue. Indeed, a lot of the money
coming here from Britain over the past
year appears to have a more contented
than heated look about it. Witness the
orgy of takeovers being perpetrated to
get hold of permanent assets in Aus-
tralia. Probably because we want to
keep as much of the inflow here for
keeps, nobody, not even Mr. McEwen,
seems at all worried about this orgy.
Thus it isn’t so surprising that the
Americans have also taken a cue from
it all the talk of its recent official
trade mission hasn’t been of trade by
any means and that one or two more
vocal Japanese have been canvassing
the takeover and joint-venture attrac-
tions as sure ways to get on the direct-
investment bandwagon.

The econamy: Australian retailers had their best month
on a seasonally adjusted basis in March . . . the prices of
well over half the fully assembled Japanese cars
imported to Australia are expected to rise by $lOO-400 within
a month. Locally produced oil may put up the price of
petrol by 1.7 c a gallon next year, warned Minister for
National Development, Mr. D. E. Fairbairn . . .
The ITlOrketS .* The weakness evident early in the week
turned into a substantial downturn by Friday in London,
when the “Financial Times” industrial index suffered its
biggest daily fall since last November, bringing the
week’s loss to points from the May 3 peak of
482.9, about equal to the percent fall that took place in
July, 1966, just before the “squeeze.”
Peace prospects continued to dominate the New York
stockmarket, with cautious trading pushing share prices
slightly higher, despite a nervous day on Thursday
as rumors of Russian troop movements near the Czech
border and fears of a rough ride for President’s Johnson’s
tax bill brought some heavy profit-taking.
As Australian share markets edged cautiously forward (the
Sydney share price index rose by 4.08 points to 554.91),
the chairman of the Stock Exchange of Melbourne, Mr.
C. T. Looker, returned from Europe convinced that
overseas buyers will continue to invest in Australia . . .
but in Melbourne, also, Sir Paul Chambers, leading British
industrialist (ex ICI) optimistically forecast a reversal
of the flow of British portfolio investment, as confidence
in the British economy returned . . . Some nervousness was
evident early in the week on BHP and WMC prices,
and the shares weakened to $22.50 and $11.60 respectively,
before rallying to about 50c short of last week’s final
prices. BHP closed at $23.80, WMC at $12.40. But
other nickel prospects, North Kalgoorlie and Great Boulder
firmed on news of an extensive nickel search . . . The
Murphyores debut gave stags a 140 percent profit, with the
shares hitting $4.30 on Thursday, and only slight
reaction to $3.90 on Friday’s close.
Companies .’ N.S.W.’s biggest brewer, Tooth and Co.,
overcame industrial trouble and a sharp increase in tax
liability to produce a 12 percent lift in profit to $5.5
million. Dividend was augmented to 17 percent, pre-
viously 16J percent . . . Fairymead has lifted dividend
from 6 to 7 percent, after more than doubling profit to
$580,000 in the year to December . . . but Gibson and
Howes went one better, and trebled profit. Its dividend
increased from 5 to 6 percent . . . Better results in
traditional soap and detergent activities and further
improvement in Rosella foods, projected Unilever group
profit 30 percent up on higher sales in 1967 . . .
Downtrend in PGH profits in the December half has been
arrested by a substantial recovery in the March quarter;
at the three-quarter mark, profits are slightly ahead of
the preceding year . . . Still drought affected, Tancred’s
meat business managed to return a profit in the December
half, which was better than the previous corresponding
period’s $77,000 loss . . . Improved trading for wool,
hides, and skins merchant Wilcox Mofflin in the three
quarters of the year could bring an increased dividend,
directors say . . . W. G. Watson has returned to interim
payments with a five percent dividend following better
half-year trading.
A. G. Healing incurred a $544,000 loss in the December
half, compared with $737,000 in previous corresponding
period . . . National Cash Register Co. Pty. Ltd. suffered
a sharp reverse of profit in the year to November, from
$2.15m. down to $359,000 . . . Stirling Henry’s trade
losses are $J million, according to evidence given before
the Equity Court, where the company has asked the court
to restrain the Sydney Stock Exchange from suspending
quotations of Stirling Henry shares . . . Anderson’s Seeds
lost $344,000 in trading for the year to December, com-
pared with profit of $127,000 in the previous 15 months . . .
ACF and Shirleys Fertilizers expects steady profit for
the year to September.
Mount Isa doubled its interim dividend from 4 to 8 per-
cent, indicating a higher distribution for the full year
to June 30 and suggesting a much better annual result
than had been forecast earlier . . . W.A. beach sands
miner Western Titanium lifted profit from $665,000 to
$933,000 in the year to January . . . Profit of Kathleen
Investments rose $28,000 to $586,000 in the 1967 calendar
year, but the 25 percent dividend was not covered . . .
BHAS has started producing zinc from its new $l6
million plant at Port Pirie . . . An interim dividend lift
from 4 to 4 \ percent was announced by New Redhead
Estate and Coal Co. ... A one-for-two par issue three
months after flotation will be made by Petroleum Securities,
as opportunities exist for investment of $375,000.
This week’s nickel find was by CRA-Anaconda at Higgins-
ville, 36 miles south of Kambalda, the most southerly
in which nickel sulphide intersections have been reported.
No values were given . . . Metals Ex. deepened its No. 2
drill hole, abandoned earlier, and struck 5.27 percent nickel
... A one-for-four issue at $1.50, seven times par, by
gold miner North Kalgurli, will raise million to finance
exploration of the promising Jones Sco.tia leases in con-
junction with Great Boulder . . . Indications of a major
silver ore body have been reported by Silver Valley in
the Armidale district of N.S.W., with a top value of 7840 z.
of silver to the ton assayed . . . Announcement of a one-
for-four par issue and placement of 400,000 shares at $3.45
premium was the occasion for Vam to confirm a rich
copper ore body at Mt. Oxide.

Some signs of
nervousness
in mining
WHO WOULD believe it? BHP capit-
alised at just over £200,000. Well it’s
true it happened in 1885. The com-
pany had just been floated, was rela-
tively unknown, and its shares were
selling at below par. However, it didn’t
last long. The word about the wealth
of the Hill soon spread and when it
did BHP shares were on their way. At
the end of 1885 the £2O shares paid
to £l9 were available at a meagre
£l3/10/0 four months later in
April, 1886, they were bringing £45
and by the end of the year they were
up to £73. They continued to rise
through 1887 and by the year’s end
they were commanding £175 apiece
in the market place. However, this
gain, rapid as it was, was nothing to
what was going to happen. The year
1888 opened with a bang. An epidemic
of mining fever gripped the country.
Men risked their all to get rich quick.
Investors were so excited that “a syndi-
cate would be formed, and, while the
promoters were away pegging out the
ground, the secretary would be in town
preparing the share scrip and pros-
pectus. When the promoters returned
to town they would find the prospectus
already before the public, the shares
over-applied for, and scrip selling in
the street at a premium.” Under these
conditions, BHP became an overnight
sensation. Finally on February 24
they hit £413. This was the peak.
The bubble broke and the shares fell.
To this day that record of 80 years
ago still stands. And optimistic as I am
about the prospects of BHP, I see no
chance of the shares getting up to even
one-tenth of their 1888 high. At least
not for a few years, anyhow.
A company that appeals very much
at the moment is Slater Walker Securi-
ties. The company, though it has only
been in the country for 17 morphs, is
quickly becoming known, and over the
past few months, the market has been
giving its shares the full glamor treat-
ment. They are now selling at 4.5 times
par and give every indication of going
even higher. Still, if its going to keep
up with its U.K. parent it’s still got a
long way to go. The U.K. company
started off in 1963 with $1 million and
today it has a capitalisation of over $5O
million. Both of these are takeover
merchants —but in the best possible
way. They only take over companies
which have sound assets, depth in
management, and prospects of organic
growth. Once a takeover has been
effected, the acquired company runs
along just as 'before. The only dif-
ference is that it is helped when and
if necessary by financial and any other
required know-how. The system so far
seems to be working very well and, as
the group expands, it seems reasonable
to assume that it will work even better.
Companies within the group undoubt-
edly will be able to offer each other
mutual advantages. For instance, it
would seem logical to assume that of
the companies taken over already,
Bramac and Plastalon would probably
find advantages in working together.
Other companies that have been taken
over by the group include Wancol
(through which the company got its
back-door listing), Tunleys, Thomas
Brown, and Lithgow Collieries. More
companies will be taken over as the
year progresses but, judging by the
interim report, the company seems well
able to cope. The report revealed a
one-for-five bonus, a dividend increase
from 8.75 percent to 10 percent, an
earning rate of 17.2 percent for the
eighteen months to December 31, and
a forecast that the earning rate will
show a significant improvement in the
current year.
Another company whose shares will
probably show an increase this year
is H. H. Webb. The company is in
the field of diecasting and mouldings
and is a large supplier to the funerals
industry. Although profit declined last
year and again this half-year (though
not by much) the shares look as though
they have been marked down too
severely. They are currently 41 cents
less than their high in 1967 and are
even 19 cents lower than their high for
this year. I bought 200 for recovery.
At the time of writing the mining
market is showing signs of nervousness
and so am I. I sold off three of my
miners, Mineral Deposits at a profit of
$142, Mining Traders for a profit of
$72, and my old mate Amalgamated
Petroleum for a gain of $9B.

How far down will it go?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
YES, IT IS nerve-racking, this waiting
for the market to crack and wondering
how much higher it will go before do-
ing so. And there is no doubt that it
must go over the top sooner or later.
But the important questions of when
and by how much are a bit harder.
The reality is that the downturn, when
it comes, will be sharp if only because
of the large number of investors who
are now playing the market on tech-
nical grounds; once the charts point
down they will all be falling over them-
selves to get out, just as they have been
falling over themselves to get into the
market while it has been going up.
On the other hand, there are good
reasons why the market leaders should
not be allowed to fall too far—quite
apart from the proposition that they are
probably worth considerably more,
sooner or later, than the prices that are
now being paid for stocks like BHP,
WMC and even high-flying CRA. For
when the once-and-for-all British rush
into Australian mining shares subsides
(as it must eventually) into a steady de-
mand for them, there will still be
SOME steady buying from Britain.
There seems little doubt that in the
early stages of any downturn, the tech-
nical sellers and their profit-taking
associates will provide a supply of
shares that will exceed the waning de-
mand. But when they eventually move
out of the market, the prospect is for
a continuation of steadily rising prices
toward the long-term targets that have
been set for some of these glamor
stocks, like $l5 for WMC and $3O to
$4O for BHP. So long-term investors
could well feel there is some merit in
riding out the temporary ups and downs
that are a basic feature of the stock
market.
But when will it all hpppen? There
is no sign that the British have ended
their rush, as last Friday’s usual profit-
taking at the end of the London account
period was not too disturbing to the
market although it did push several
issues down. This week should be safe
enough, but next week could be uneasy
as the market has very little to look
forward td from its idols in the near
future—and booms feed on the pros-
pect of good news. For both BHP and
WMC have already come out with their
sensations for the month.
One thing- seems likely; the coming
“adjustment” in the mining market
should not have any depressing effect
on the industrial market. On the con-
trary, it may stimulate it as investors
switch out of mining into industrial
shares, which generally seem very
moderately priced.
NO MATTER \ how nervous many
local investors are getting, there are
some whose confidence is reflected in
their risking very large sums in the
stock options market. Last week’s
options lists looked chock-full of con-
fidence (apart from the 40,000 “puts”
on Oil Search that just about doubled
the number of calls taken out).
Following the lead of the man who
made something like $300,000-odd on
an investment of about $250,000 in
about 100,000 BHP options over the
past six months, there has been a great
deal of activity in Western Mining
Corporation, with 31,000 options being
taken out last week alone. Another
heavyweight in demand (apart from
the usual calls on BHP) was Peko-
Wallsend, with about 14,000 options
taken out.
But the most striking feature of the
options market has been the sudden
rediscovery of the attractions of in-
dustrial stocks. Last week H. C. Sleigh
and Olympic Consolidated were the
second-highest traded stocks, with
15,000 options taken out on each of
them.
THREE CANDIDATES for possible
takeovers were in the rumor market
last week Australian Development
NL, Big Sister, and Drug Houses of
Australia. The good sense that a Peko-
Wallsend bid for Australian Develop-
ment would make was mentioned on
our mining page last week. But it now
seems unlikely that Peko is initiating
any moves that way at the moment.
It seems more probably that Peko is
not in any hurry; Australian Develop-
ment has a lot of hard work ahead of
it getting its new equipment working
and looking for an extension of Peko’s
rich Juno orebody into its property
(which is on the cards).
But this does Hot remove the com-
The Chartist says:
BRAMBLES INDUSTRIES LTD. is a promising industrial stock on technical
grounds for further growth potential. It has been very much a cyclical issue since
1960 and an interesting trendline study. The period of consolidation from 1966 to
1968 has taken the form of a head-and-shoulders base reversal pattern. Prices over
the past few weeks have broken topside from an upslanting wedge which suggests
a rather powerful move. Some resistance will be encountered about the $l.BO level
but a minimum probable move to approximately $2.40 is indicated with the possi-
bility of a further move to $3.00 for the longer term. Last sale price on 9/5/68,
$1.64.

pany from the category of being in
imminent danger of acquisition. Apart
from its Tennant Creek gold mine, and
the shallow copper prospect it has un-
earthed nearby (whose significance may
turn out to be greater than the market
realises at present), the company has a
joint W.A. mineral venture with Con-
west. So Australian Development looks
a likely proposition for one of the big
foreign mining groups looking for a
stake in Australia.
If such a bid came, it is almost cer-
tain that Peko would counter-bid to
protect its own role at Tennant Creek.
And with the premium now on Peko
shares, it would be an inexpensive pur-
chase in capital terms.
The Big Sister rumor, which has
brought a rapid rise in the company’s
shares from as low as $2.25 earlier this
year to $3.60, mentioned Unilever as a
possible spouse, but this is not so;
Unilever sees no merit in taking over
a company that would leave it com-
peting with its customers in the baking
business. It seems much more likely
that one of the big baking groups, like
Westons, Allied Mills or Fielders would
be more interested in getting off with
Big Sister.
The Drug Houses rumor appears to
be simply an extension of the inevitable
discussions about what Washington
Soul Pattinsons is going to do with all
the money it has made in the market,
particularly on Western Mining, and
whether it intends doing anything with
the massive premium on its $1 shares
now that they stand at almost $lO.
There would be some logic in Wash-
ington Soul’s taking Drug Houses,
whose record has been far from impres-
sive. There would also be something
of an irony involved; Drug Houses re-
cently sold off its chain of Hallams
chemists because it couldn’t make a go
of them and this would now remoVte
any legal obstacle from the path of
chemist shop operator Washington Soul
getting DHA.
The Melbourne Market
There is plenty
of business
THE BULLS did not have it all their
own way last week, but trading so far
this month has been about its most
active ever. In the first week of May
the average turnover in the market was
more than three million shares, which
contrasts with the average daily turn-
over of 2.2 million in February last;
this is easily a record for any five trad-
ing days. The top daily turnover of
3.3 million shares, traded on May 3,
was pretty near the all-time high of
3.5 million on February 6, itself double
the best trading day in 1966. As meas-
ured by the all-ordinaries index, share
prices have risen, by 20 percent this
year, but the more faithful reflection
of the market’s performance lies in the
upswings in metals and oils. The Mel-
bourne metals index has advanced 54
percent and the oil index 53 percent
since the beginning of the year, 'and
hardly a day goes by when minerals
do not monopolise the top ten places
of shares traded on a value basis.
There’s no place for Cassandra in
this market, any set-back in prices of
minerals being held strictly temporary.
Anybody essaying a realistic long-term
appreciation of the long-term earnings
of mining companies, or doubting the
lasting qualities of the flimsiest minerals
proposition laced with the thought of
owing some responsibility to clients
passionate for capital gains, is likely to
be laughed out of court; any attempt
to relate historical trends in metals
prices or likely economic prospects to
current share prices is regarded simply
as old hat.' Those brokers away in
London whipping up fodder to feed the
boom or recently returned to tell of
their success, as the chairman of the
Melbourne Stock Exchange was last
week with tidings ‘of more and more
money to come indefinitely, have haloes
on their heads. Those staying at home
are getting as rich as sin in the wake
of the overseas excursions. The only
people who ought to look out, accord-
ing to Mr. Looker, are small Australian
investors, who shouldn’t rush in even
if overseas angels and others don’t fear
to tread. Not that we’ve heard of any-
body, big or small, having had an
order turned back, though some firms,
such as J. B. Were and Son, are, one
believes, still sticking to their old-estab-
lished rules for dealing in mining shares.
Some gratuitous advice as to the pos-
sible lasting quality of overseas support
for our share markets has also been
offered by a couple of potable over-
seas visitors. Early in the week Sir Paul
Chambers, the retiring chairman of ICI,
out here on a farewell visit to the
board of ICIANZ, which he is also
leaving, suggested not only that over-
seas support could wane but that it
could in the circumstance of a British
economic recovery go into reverse,
whatever the future of the freedom of
flow of overseas private capital invest-
ment from Britain. For his part, Lord
Brown, Minister at the U.K. Board of
Trade, talked of possible curbs in the
ignominious terms of whether the out-
flow “got out of hand.” He admitted
that it is very difficult “to know the
size of this investment within a short
period of it taking place.” Obviously,
it is anybody’s guess what will happen
on this front, but on balance it would
seem that a degree of caution is appro-
priate.
ELMACO 50-cent shares have had a
poor trot since they were listed at
80 cents in 1965. Apart-from the odd
sale shortly after the float at a cent or
two over their issue price, they’ve been
consistently well under it, that is until
last week, when they were bought up
to 87 cents. On one occasion in 1966,
when they perked up to 75 cents on a
takeover rumor, the Stock Exchange
apparently thought it incredible enough
to buzz the secretary. Earlier this year
they were down to 61 cents, at which
price they gave a dividend yield of just
over 9 percent on the 11 percent pay-
ment (the prospectus estimate which
has been met each year so far) and a
yield of about 20 percent on the 1966-67
earnings rate of 24.4 percent, which
itself was a slight improvement on the
previous year’s of 20.8, when profits
were affected by the settling in process
at the company’s new Huntingdale fac-
tory. With news of a lift in profit in
the half year to December 31 last in
hand (but not supported by any
figures), these yields looked attractive
and the shares started an advance which
could well continue.
Early on, Elmaco wasn’t exactly a
favorite of The Bulletin, but it may
now be right to revise that opinion in
the light of recent developments and
its establishment as a good earner and
payer. The most interesting develop-
ment was its takeover of Ring Grip Ltd.,
one of the companies nurtured by
Australian United Corporation (inci-
dentally, Elmaco itself was floated under
the aegis of lan Potter and Co.), and
the acquisition by a Ring Grip sub-
sidiary of the brand name and trading
assets of Sturdee Electrical, a Mel-
bourne - based electrical accessories-
manufacturer. The upshot of all this is
that Elmaco now has about 45 percent
of the Australian market for electric
accessories (these are not the whole of
its stock in trade, however, as it has a
strong plastics section and specialises in
toys, fluorescent lighting accessories, and
other industrial equipment, as well).
The sweetener in this direction, of
course, is that since March there has
been a big lift in prices of electrical
accessories from which the group can
reckon to gain considerably. In fact,
one calculation puts the additional
overall benefits from the price increase
and the additional share of the market
at about $150,000 at current sales rates,
which would give a very pleasant-
looking advance on last year’s net profit
figure of $366,000. Possibly the dross
in this golden prospect is that the recent
acquisitions must have cost the group
finances rather dearly in liquidity terms,
because they were financed internally.
The company looks a bit under-capital-
ised as it is, or at least did before the
Ring Grip adhesion. Anyway, it looks
very much on the cards that once the
shares get above the dollar mark, say,
the board will be thinking seriously of
coming to shareholders for more cash,
which they would have to do on pretty
favorable terms, say a rights issue at
par. At present the shares are rather on
the low side for such an exercise, but
taking everything into consideration it
might not be long before the price was
right for its successful accomplishment.

Behind the balance sheets
The good value in Email
EMAIL LTD is not a dramatic stock
these days, but it is good value. It has
had most of the recovery in share price
it is likely to get, the past 18 mont s
rise from 36 cents to present levels
around 84 cents does not leave very
much foi further capital appreciation
before the company gets back to its
proper level of around a dollar (and
the Chartists say that it has to pass
through a very heavy resistance level
to get much above 85 cents). But
Email shares bring a handy income and
prospects of moderate capital apprecia-
tion as its profits steadily improve.
~,. . . r
And they are improving After a very
sick year in 1 965, Email Ltd has re-
habilitated itself pretty well, even
though it is not advertising the cure.
The company feels it now has the
key to success with appliances, and
industrial air-conditioning is producing
satisfactory results, although this is a
longer haul; these two areas were the
source of trouble in 1965, when profit
fell to approximately half its usual or
'expected level.
Since the bottom fell out of this
market in 1956, every appliance maker
has been struggling, and Email was
close to despair, but its struggle has
paid off handsomely. The dreadful de-
pendence on domestic appliances has
been relieved, by concentrating on in-
dustrial products and engineering. The
business now , breaks down about 60
percent industrial products and engin-
eering, 40 percent consumer products
and commercial cooking and heating
equipment.
But through concerted effort, new
techniques, venturing into new product
areas, and new models, it has made
considerable progress in consumer pro-
ducts in the past two years, increasing
sales, market share, and contribution to
group profits. For instance, four years
ago, Email changed its old design com-
pressor manufactured for refrigeration,
under licence from Westinghouse, and
results are much improved.
It has also had the courage to pull
out of unprofitable ventures like Perma-
Sharp blades and Brooks Robinson’s
glazing and shop-fitting business.
In the 12 months to December, 1967,
Australian official statistics reveal a
very healthy growth in production of
washing machines, up 13 percent,
household refrigeration up 8 percent,
retail sales of electrical goods generally
up 5.3 percent. On the other side of
Email’s business, electric motors pro-
duction for Australia rose 10 percent,
so economic factors were favorable to-
ward Email, which took advantage of
them.
The recovery of the past two years
has been impressive. Profit in the year
to December, 1966, recovered from
$617,000 to $1,459,000, if capital profit
of $91,000 is excluded, and both the
provision of $400,000 for the loss on
the associated company Coramic Aust.
Pty. Ltd. and the $351,968 write-back
of provision for fluctuation in stock
values and other sundries are extracted.
The profit advance was made after
writing off against profits the $186,000
bad debt with H. G. Palmer, because of
its size and special nature, although
doubtful-debts provision was ample to
cover this.
The latest result confirmed the re-
covery, being $1,920,000 profit, ignoring
the capital profit of $262,000. The very
satisfactory earning rate of 17.5 percent
allowed acceleration of the dividend to
11 percent, after a couple of lean years.
Capital profits of over $1.3 million
have been obtained on realisation
mainly of investments, and some fixed
assets, too. The company felt it could
liquidate some of these listed invest-
ments, and there should be some profit-
taking this year. The proceeds from
these sales can go quite a way toward
the SIJ million programmed to be
spent on the Waterloo plant to make
carburettors under licence, to fulfil
long-term contracts for Chrysler, and
the current ratio in recent years has
shown quite a flush position.
Adjusting profits for minority inter-
est, and excluding investment income,
the tax provided each year looks in
line with standard rates, but the expen-
diture on the carburettor plant, most
of it in 1968-69, some perhaps next
year, should bring significant tax relief
this year. The financing should be
solely from internal sources, so there
will be no strain on profits in the
interim until the plant is profitable.
No indication has been given in pub-
lished accounts as to the magnitude of
capital expenditure in recent years, and
the subtraction of the HP motor divi-
sion from group accounts on the June,
1966, merger with A. J. Chown’s sub-
sidiary, Brinsmead Pty. Ltd. (now an
associate company, with 50-50 percent
ownership), disguises the growth which
would normally be discernable in fixed
assets, shown in consolidated accounts
at around $9 million. But there was
heavy expenditure involved in trans-
ferring the major appliances to the
Orange factory, and $750,000 (of which
$350,000 is on buildings) is now being
spent on an expansion of the consumer-
products division in Orange.
The Carmichael-Parkinson ranges
and stoves was amalgamated with the
consumer-products division at Orange,
to utilise the factory to better advant-

age, and balance production over the
seasons of the year.
Email has affiliations with more than
30 overseas concerns in England, Ger-
many, Switzerland, Italy, Japan, and
America, for the manufacture of their
products, and agency agreements with
another 40. Principal brand names of
Email products are Westinghouse,
Emmco, Eicon, Corox, Carmichael,
and Lennox.
One of the most interesting could be
the 1966 tie-up with the American
Meter Company under which Email is
licensee for gas meters and products
suitable for domestic and industrial
application, which will enable Email to
take advantage of natural-gas usage.
This could be a source of considerable
income in the next few years, as two
States adapt to natural-gas usage.
Export markets in the Pacific and
South-East Asian areas are not of great
magnitude yet, but exports doubled
in 1967 on 1966 figures, and this year
and next year might bring significant
benefits in profit and export rebates for
tax purposes. The company is looking
to Europe, especially U.K., as a market
for such items as small circuit breakers
and tubular heating elements for
ranges, where Australian methods are
well advanced, and it has some patent-
able ideas.
The company has invested large
sums (a gross $2.7 million in 1967
accounts) in associated and non-listed
companies (subject to a $300,000 pro-
vision for fluctuations in investment
values) to allow flexibility and sensible
diversification. Not all have been happy
experiments. An excursion into tiles
with ACI (Coramic) cost the company
about $1 million in losses. Technical
problems and strong competition
prompted the company to merge with
the U.K. Richards Tiles’ interest in
Victoria (Richards is currently merg-
ing with Johnson in the U.K. to create
the largest tile group in the world), and
Email has only a 12£ percent interest.
The group is currently operating suc-
cessfully, with expectations of a satis-
factory return in future.
Email’s 50 percent interest in Brins-
mead is flourishing. It also has a 50
percent interest in Dymo Australia Pty.
the labeller which made $BO,OOO in the
year to June, 1967; a 50 percent inter-
est in BX Plastics Australia (formerly
British Xylonite) which was losing
money, but in the current year under
new management is said to be profit-
able. The 40 percent shareholding in
Formica Plastics, making laminated
plastics at Thornleigh (N.S.W.), and
the half interest in TR Services
(switchboard and intercom equipment
on rental to client under a service con-
tract) are probably the biggest money-
spinners among Email’s associated
interests.
Investment income represented an
abnormally high percentage (48 per-
cent) of group profits in 1965, but in
the past two years it has been about
13 to 14 percent. The return on book
value of associated investments was 10.7
percent in 1967 (up from 7.8 percent
in 1966, probably when Coramic blot-
ted the record) whereas the return on
listed investments is always less than 6
percent on cost, and in 1967 was less
than 3 percent on market value. The
market value of listed investments was
$4,536,000 at balance date, compared
with book value of $2,251,000, hence
the temptation to realise the paper pro-
fits, and put the funds to more con-
structive use in manufacturing and
associated interests.
The company at December 31, 1967,
had loaned $l.l million to associated
companies, the expanding ones like
Brinsmead probably taking most of the
17 percent increase in 1967.
Gross trade debtors fell 15 percent,
and provision for doubtful debts repre-
sented about 8 percent in 1967. Gross
stocks were 16 percent higher at $17.7
million, subject to a SIJ million pro-
vision for fluctuations in stock values.
The hire-purchase subsidiary, Allied
Credits, had amounts due and to
mature of $7 million, less $1.4 million
income yet to mature and doubtful
debts. It finances group sales to whole-
salers.
Among current liabilities, provision
for research and education $1 million,
and provision for warranty on goods
sold $1 million, have existed for years,
and illustrate the accounting conservat-
ism of the organisation. Although the
company announced years back that it
would charge research against this
provision instead of against profits, it
has continued to charge day-to-day ap-
plied research against profits, and these
are believed to run something like $|
million a year. It is very often difficult
to differentiate between applied re-
search and product redevelopment or
redesign, but it looks as if Email always
takes the conservative view, and has
used the $1 million as a depository for
surplus profits.
The only capital move in recent
years was the one-for-four bonus in the
flush year of 1956. Beyond a dividend
increment or two, no benefit seems in
the offing from the company, which
still has plenty of fat. If and when the
investments are liquidated, the com-
pany could once again turn to share-
holders for the means to finance associ-
ated activities.
Meanwhile, the stock offers a respect-
able income return of 6.7 percent on
last year’s dividend of 11 percent, and
10.7 percent on earnings. Contribution
of the improved profit trend is strongly
evident in the early months of 1968, so
the investing public can take pleasure
in the restoration to respectable profit-
ability of a one-time leader.

Security analysis
The lead in Horton’s pencil
G. H. HORTON, born in Chicago,
spent his youth as a maker and repairer
of pipe organs and plied his trade work-
ing for circuses up and down the U.S.
Horton left the sawdust and tinsel be-
hind in 1913, co'ming to Sydney with
$2O in his pocket at the age of 28,
working first as a piano tuner and then
turning back to his old trade among
the pipe organs. In 1919, he went into
business with three associates, one of
whom was N. J. Howes, making music
rolls for the then booming business of
pianolas. Today, G. H. Horton & Co.
Ltd., which became listed as a public
company in 1947, is in the capable ,
hands of the second-generation Howes
and Hortons H. J. A. Howes is
chairman and his brother, N. J. V.
Howes, is a director, while N. W. Hor-
ton is managing director and his
brother, P. D. Horton, is an executive
director. G. H. Horton remained a
director of the company until his death
in 1967 at the age of 82.
The music-roll business became a vic-
tim of the depression of the 19305, al-
though the company continued to 'make
the product in limited quantities until
as late as 1961. To keep the struggling
business afloat, the decision was made
to get into a more basic bread-and-
butter line, and in 1932 a licence was
concluded with Columbia Ribbon and
Carbon Manufacturing Co. Inc. of the
U.S. to make carbon papers and type-
writer ribbons in Australia. Manufac-
ture commenced in 1932, and the die
was set for G. H. Horton to become
the largest manufacturer of carbon
papers and ribbons in Australia. The
association with Columbia down
through the years has proved most
fruitful, for the U.S. company is a
world leader in its field, enabling G. H.
Horton to keep in front. In 1937, the
co'mpany commenced to make lead
pencils.
On a turnover and profit composition
mix, pencils constitute about one-third,
carbon papers one-third, and the bal-
ance is in typewriter ribbons, computer
ribbons, magnetic ribbons, computer
tapes, paper rolls for adding and calcu-
lating machines, and carbonised rolls.
Although market shares are difficult to
estimate in this territory, it would ap-
pear to be the case that G. H. Horton
has about 40 percent of the carbon-
paper market in Australia, about 50
percent of the ribbon business, and
about 40 percent of the pencil market.
In brand names you are probably
familiar with “Columbia” and “Cum-
berland” in the pencil range, and with
“Columbia” in carbon papers and rib-
bons. The group has a 100,000 sq. ft.
factory complex at Lane Cove (Sydney)
on an eight-acre site, sales offices in
Melbourne (where some partial manu-
facture is carried on), and also in Bris-
bane, and is represented elsewhere in
Australia by agents. Group employment
is about 330. There has been a com-
pound annual rate of growth in sales
of about 8 percent over the past decade,
but it has now steadied down to about
5 percent,
Traditionally, carbon paper consisted
of high-quality paper imported from
the U.K. with 100 percent rag content,
in which a mixture of hot waxes, oils,
and pigments was applied to the sur-
face of the paper. The wear of the
carbon paper was limited by the
amount of wax in the paper, and in
typing some of the surface material
came off after each use, giving the
typist a smudgy i'mprint on her hands,
which was messy and unsightly. In the
19505, solvent, carbons were invented to
increase the wear of the carbons and
avoid the messy hands. As typists are in
short supply, it is not surprising that
solvent carbons are fast taking over
from waxed carbons. The cost is 50 per-
cent as much again as the waxed car-
bons in the case of solvent paper
carbons, and twice as much for plastic
solvent carbons; the wear goes up at
least three times for the new paper
carbons and five times for the plastic-
film carbons.
Solvent carbons are made up of a
mikture of synthetic resin and nodules
of ink suspended in a solvent, and this
coating of resin-ink solvent is applied
on paper or polyester plastic film. The
wear in these carbons is balanced by the
thickness of the coating and the amount
of ink in it. G. H. Horton commenced
to 'make solvent carbons in 1961 and is
one of the only two Australian manu-
facturers the other is the Lamson
subsidiary Caribonum. In addition to
scooping the pool on solvent carbons,
Horton makes a full range of the tradi-
tional waxed carbons and one-time
carbon paper, which is a waxed product
used in business forms.
Office-machine ribbons are made of
cotton, nylon, or silk, which is imported
in wide bulk form and the fabric is
slit, sealed so it won’t fray, inked, and
then processed into myriad types of
ribbons and spools. It is traditional that
the people who make carbon papers
also handle ribbons, and G. H. Horton
also leads its competitors in this pro-
duct area. A new line currently being
imported, but which should go well, is
the supply of magnetic ribbons used in
the magnetic coding of bank cheques.
Computer ribbons, which are used in
the computer print-out process, are
another growth line and this already
accounts for about four percent of
group annual sales.
The lead pencil is a very old form
of manufacture, with commercial pro-
duction dating back to about 1564 in
the first Elizabethan era. But the pencil
does not contain lead and never has.
The modern pencil dates back to 1795,
when Conte, a Frenchman, mixed fine-
ground clay and graphite into a thick
paste from which the leads were
moulded and then baked at very high
temperatures. This made possible the
manufacture of pencils of varying de-
grees of hardness. An HB pencil con-
sists of about one-third clay, while the
lead in an extremely hard drafting
pencil, such as 9H, is over two-thirds
clay. G. H.' Horton uses clay from
Dubbo and other areas in Australia,
graphite from Ceylon and Korea, and
American cedar wood. For colored
pencils a composite of pigments, waxes,
and clays is used.
G. H. Horton’s pencil subsidiary,
Columbia and Cumberland Pencil Co.
Pty. Ltd., is 66 2-3rd percent owned,
with the balancing l-3rd of the capital
held by British Pens Ltd., which con-
trol Cumberland Pencil Co. Ltd., U.K.,
Britain’s largest producer of colored
pencils. The English company acquired
its minority holding in 1959. The range
includes “Derwent” colored pencils for
artists, which are available in 72 colors
and are imported from the U.K.,
“Columbia Copperplate,” a 14-degree
range of black lead pencils, “Lakeland,”
available in 24 colors, “Coloursketch,”
a 12-color range, “Black Edge,” and
“Columbia” carpenters’ pencils and
“Columbia” cosmetic pencils.

Earned for ordinary reached
$lBB,OOO in 1960, and there was a slid-

was a culmination of post-recession
blues and the disruption to the com-
pany by the transfer of the whole
manufacturing complex from Waterloo,
where it had been located since the
19305, to the new factory at Lane
Cove.
The 1968 interim announced a rise
in profit for the six months to Decem-
ber, 1967, compared with the corres-
ponding period in the previous year. In
the pencil division, sales are very
seasonal, reflecting the demand for sup-
plies by the education authorities at the
start of a new school year. In the other
company activities, sales are on a more
even balance throughout the year.
The last capital issue made by the
company was in April, 1961, which
took the form of a bonus of one-for-
five. Shares are not always easy to come
by, as the top 20 shareholders, includ-
ing members of the Howes and Horton
families, control about 70 percent of
the equity capital. At $2.60 there is an
attractive dividend yield of 6.2 percent.
The price earnings ratio is 8.4.

The cold feet in Westralian
THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN
beachsands miner Westralian Oil Ltd.
is recovering from the most' drastic
share-price setback experienced since
the company beca'me a market favorite
about five years ago. That it has been
such a market favorite is the main rea-
son for the severity of this reverse; it
had been taken up as a good, reliable
low-priced stock by investors who were
then to be frightened out by the com-
pany’s March decision not to pay an
interim dividend. On the day of this
announcement the shares, which had
gone as high as $1.45 this year, tumbled
to 85 cents.
An analysis of the facts available
shows that this selling was more the
result of cold feet than cold calcula-
tion. By the company’s own assessment
the dropped dividend means simply that
“we reverted to our previous routine of
paying only one dividend a year.” Al-
though at least two brokers Potter’s
in Melbourne and Poynton’s in Perth
have recommended Westralian Oil
as a good buy since then; the shock of
the March announcement has not worn
off. And this announcement is yet to
be followed up by mellowing news from
the company.
Reasons given for dropping the
interim dividend were that profitability
was being affected adversely, firstly by
sterling devaluation and secondly by
the fact that only one dividend would
be received during the year from the
associate company, Western Mineral
Sands Pty. Ltd.
Sterling devaluation means a poten-
tial 14 percent cut in the profitability
of contracts with British Titan Products
Co. Ltd. This long-term contract was
originally the backbone of Westralian
Oil’s beach-sands business. It was signed
-at £stgs f.o.b. per ton for 70,000 tons
•of ilmenite over five years from 1961;
this was renegotiated on the same
iterms to end in 1971. The importance
•of this contract to Westralian Oil has
diminished considerably, as the produc-
tion figures show. When originally
•signed, it meant virtually the whole
of the production; on the 1968 esti-
mated figures it will represent 68 per-
cent and on 1969 figures 53 percent of
total ilmenite produced.
The point at issue now is whether
£stgs is $12.50 or $10.75. The company
is negotiating with British Titan Pro-
ducts for some compromise, which
should be reached soon. Even if no
compromise is possible, and the contract
continues on the basis of £stgs meaning
the post devaluation figure of $10.75,
then it should not have such a trau-
matic effect on profits that the share
price should be slashed in anticipation.
Assuming net profit to rise in proportion
with sales volume; net profit for the
current year would be $765,000 on pre-
devaluation exchange, $712,000 on post-
devaluation figures, compared with last
year’s $547,000. November devaluation
could affect, on this year’s production,
less than half the 70,000 tons contracted
to be sold. And compromise on price is
likely soon.
The other point of only one divi-
dend being received this year from
Western Mineral Sands smells of a
red herring. This was simply a matter
of the way the two companies’ financial
years overlapped, and would have
been known and presumably allowed
for well in advance. Western Mineral


CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

A MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF COMPANIES
Sands is owned two-thirds by Australian
Titan Products Pty. Ltd. and one-third
by Westralian Oil. In announcing a
higher group profit for 1967, ATP
pointed out that this was from higher
dividend inco’me and that Western Min-
eral Sands doubled its payout to
$300,000. So what Westralian Oil lost
on the swing it would more than pick
up on the roundabout. Apart from the
one-third equity, which stands to yield
a doubled return, Westralian Oil gets
a 50 cent per ton royalty from Western
Mineral Sands.
Since announcing the dropped
interim dividend, the company’s chair-
man, Mr. Edgar Elvey, has been in
Japan talking with buyers and potential
buyers. This is being followed up cur-
rently by samples sent from Capel to
Japan. Earlier trial shipments have gone
to Japan, and directors have said they
expect to market the whole of their
additional tonnage at satisfactory prices.
Expanded production is planned for
more efficient development of the ore-
bodies at Yoganup, 10 miles in from
the Western Australian coast near Bus-
selton, on what was once the shoreline.
Two grades of il'menite will be mined,
with the new grade averaging 55-56
per cent titanium dioxide.

Oil was the main hope in 1954 when
the late Mr. Stan Watt, a Kalgoorlie
Chamber of Mines graduate, who
became a printer, set up the company
with Perth solicitor Mr. Ralph Stod-
dart, who is still on the board. However,
it was quickly realised that the com-
pany did not have enough capital to
explore for oil, and in 1956 the com-
pany went into the minerals sands busi-
ness at Yoganup and Capel (where
Western Titanium operates). The stock-
market first saw the glamor potential
of this industry about 1963, when the
share price had been as low as 15 cents.
The obvious prospects have attracted
15,000 investors, most of them small
investors. The first setback came in
1964, when an expected dividend did
not eventuate; the second has followed
the dropping of the interim dividend.
Apart from its beach sands, the com-
pany holds several oil tenements. These
include a one-eighth interest in pet-
roleum exploration permits number 36
(offshore in Bass Strait, near Torquay,
from Wilson’s Promontory to east of the
entrance to Port Phillip Bay); number
53 (onshore in an east-west slab inland
from Wilson’s Promontory); as well as
one-fifth in number 548 (on the coast
south of Geelong). A 97| percent stake
is held in the Northern Territory in
oil licence number 1 (on the Western
Australian border south of Bonaparte
Gulf, with the Alliance Group having
2\ percent gross royalty interest in pro-
duction). And in Western Australia,


Ever been caught
by a boom ?
There has never been a time in Australia’s history when people ha
been as wine conscious as they are now.
But the great upsurge in interest, coupled with a dry year, have c
shortages of many of the best wines Australia produces.
One of the things about a boom, when the goods are in short supp
is that standards can slip.
Orlando’s standards will not slip.
For years, in anticipation, we have been thinking ahead - planti
areas and new varieties, developing and exploring new techniqui
equipment - and we will continue to do so.
But even so, current demand has outstripped us.
If you find difficulty on occasion in obtaining your chosen Orlar
table wines, we hope you will remember that while we would like
advantage of the boom, we are utterly convinced that it is more
important to preserve the quality that has achieved such high
recognition of our wines at home and abroad.

Westralian Oil is 100 percent holder of
permits to explore numbers 106 H
(11,600 square miles in the Kimberleys)
and 253 H (5200 square miles in the
promontory north of Derby).
No major work has been carried out
in any of the areas in the past year,
although the company’s annual report
notes that photo-geological studies of
the sedimentary areas in the Western
Australian tenements are nearly finished.
These are on the fringes of what are
considered promising areas, although
Westralian Oil do not hold what appear
at this stage to be the prime tenements.
In another year or so the whole oil
perspective, of the Kimberley area par-
ticularly, is likely to have changed as
offshore exploration gets under way be-
tween the Ashmore Reef area and the
coast. From this point of view the com-
pany has “bottom drawer” attractions.
But beach sands production is
basically Westralian Oil’s industry, and
it is to this sector that the investor must
look. Of beach sands, lan Potter and
Co. say: “The industry now receives
the highest rating by investors and
many companies are selling at more
than 20 times their expected earnings
in 1969-70. This partly reflects the
general mining boom, but also inves-
tors’ appreciation of an industry in
which large increases in output are
taking place under stable prices.”
From a market viewpoint, Westra-
lian Oil has suffered from over-
exposure, picked out as an attractive
and safe stock by a number of brokers
and finance writers. This aggravated
what, on analysis, must be regarded as
panic selling. The company may have
an ace or two up its sleeve. In the
market there are rumors of a deal with
Consolidated Gold Fields of Australia;
it is assumed this would be a scheme to
take up the new upgrading techniques
being tested by Western Titanium and
to be adopted by the exciting new-
comer Murphyores Holdings Ltd.
Westralian Oil also have a stockpile of
leucoxene, its mining expenses written
off, but they are still unable to find a
market.
If Westralian Oil shares were worth
$1.45 earlier this year, they are worth
no less now. A strong case can be made
out for them being over-valued at that
price, with many investors probably
unaware that they are dealing in 20-
cent units. But in the current market
climate, particularly for mining stocks,
this company has the ingredients of
excitement; increasing production and
potential; a toehold in the offshore oil
areas that are likely to be in the news
in the next few months; and the like-
lihood of less dampening announce-
ments soon to be made.

THE LAND
The right size for rural holdings
AFTER all these years, Australian rural
industries should have a pretty good
idea of the optimum size of land hold-
ings for successful operation in the
various parts of the country for the
diverse agricultural and pastoral activi-
ties.
All we've got in the way of a national
compendium in this field is the series
currently being issued by the Common-
wealth Statistician on the sizes of rural
holdings in various States. It gives no
clue to how much profit (or loss)
accrues to the holdings. So why don’t
the various State Departments of Agri-
culture employ some university students
studying the subject to go around in the
vacations to supplement the new
volumes with some facts on profita-
bility? Even on a sample basis they
would be highly useful with so much
thought of reallocating agricultural
resources in the air. The only way we’ll
achieve the optimum usage of agri-
cultural and pastoral land in Australia
is by rationalising it on the basis of
profitability experience related to hold-
ing sizes and type of commercial pro-
motion. 1
Of course, such an exercise is far
too big and time-consuming to get our
rural industries off the costs and prices
hooks of their present profitability
troubles; but since so much is already
known about the commercial organisa-
tion of rural industry by its own organi-
sations as well as Government Depart-
ments, the Treasury in particular, a
nationally organised assault on the
problem could easily throw up some
useful angles even on the shorter-term
aspect. Anyway, what is needed is a
comprehensive study relating profita-
bility to the holding’s size and form of
commercial organisation over the whole
of our rural industry, as a basis for a
long-term reassessment of the deploy-
ment of our rural resources.
On the heels of Mr. LeCouteur’s
criticism of over-fragmentation of graz-
ing properties into uneconomic units
(8., May 4), and the National Council
of Woolselling Brokers’ mooting of the
establishment of wool villages, where
industry services would be centralised
to avail woolgrowers of the full bene-
fits of containerisation (an idea which
seems to get bogged down somewhere),
a Victorian farmer, Mr. Campbell Cur-
tis, of Meringur, has come up with a
suggestion for the formation of wool
communes. It has been ventilated as
a counter to a recent proposal that
the Federal Government should buy up
uneconomic holdings in the wool indus-
try and resell them to other growers
to achieve more economic sizes of hold-
ings. The implication behind the latter
is that, as foreshadowed in the Dairy
Industry reorganisation scheme, some
woolgrowers (more particularly, as it
happens, soldier settlers in the high-
rainfall areas) would be pushed out of
the industry or at least forced to take
dependent jobs with the remaining
proprietors.
Turning his face against that pro-
posal, and also Government subsidies
for wool, Mr. Curtis embraces recon-
sideration of both holdings’ size and
commercial organisation in his com-
munes proposal designed to restore
profitability of small woolgrowers. The
upshot of it is that groups of small
farmers would pool their assets to make
a single unit to be operated communally
by them. Under this plan amalgamated
holdings would be formed into a com-
pany or co-operative. Thus, it is
claimed, would current disadvantages
suffered by individual proprietors be
mitigated, including over-capitalisation
of properties, high and rising operating
costs (economies of scale working
there), poor borrowing powers, and
general limitations on expansion.
As he puts it, “If groups of perhaps
three to six or even more small farmers
were to group their assets and operate
their capital, including land, as one
unit (and with formal agreement be-
tween the members as to the method of
operating the resulting company), then
a very significant move in the total
productivity and efficiency must result.
It is quite patent that capital could be
effectively focused by this 'means in-
stead of being dispersed as it is now
over a number of parallel operations.” -
He also points to numerous other ad-
vantages, such as arising in the event
of a member wanting to pull out, when
it would be easy for the group to
finance the acquisition of his land. He
admits that operating within the limits-
of a company or a co-operative would
require a new discipline from farmers
used to operating independently, but
counters that “unfortunately the land-
holder engaged in high-intensity farm-
ing in the wool industry is faced with
an unpleasant choice. Either he may
relinquish some of his individuality in
order to remain on the land, or he
must be prepared before long to lose
his vocation, his land, and his freedom
of operation.” In other words, let us
say, he will be swallowed up by one
of the big landed corporations, possibly
with the aid of ever-willing assistance
from life company funds, which have
been so active this past year or so.
Agrisearch
The measures of success in beef
TORRID TIMES lie ahead for the
beef cattle studs. Will they continue
to base their values on the mystique of
the show ring or be guided by the
needle-point on a scale? The Australian
Committee of Animal Production,
which draws its authority from the
Standing Committee on Agriculture,
has dared to formulate an objective
plan for selecting breeding stock. It is
based solely on measurable traits of
real economic importance. A further
sub-committee has been appointed to
devise a practical method of recording
and certifying the performance of beef
cattle breeding stock. The committee
has already firmly recommended that
“State Departments of Agriculture col-
lect and assess data to the point where
a choice of stock can be made.” By
implication this committee, consisting
of geneticists and other scientists, is
saying that it knows of no other
grounds for preferring one beast to
another.
In sepulchral tones, the committee’s
report makes it clear that superior
beasts exist only in the eye of the be-
holder or studmaster. In fact, the shape
and appearance of an animal bear no
correlation to the amount of red meat
that can be cut from its carcass. Dis-
section studies have shown consistently
that the distribution and size of the
muscles are virtually identical in all
beef breeds, regardless of extreme
variation in the outward appearance
of the animals. This holds for Brah-
mans, too, which even a blind man
could distinguish from the British
breeds.
Neither do appearances provide any
hint of the animal’s efficiency in con-
verting feed to meat, or any informa-
tion about its reproductive capacity.

However, the experts concede that the
absence of horns and deformities are
features that the eye can readily per-
ceive and which may be associated to
some extent with economic meat pro-
duction.
Superior animals can be recognised
only by certain measurements; and if
there is any debate, it should be directed
toward which particular measurements
are the most helpful and how they
should be made. The commercial beef
producer and the butcher are primarily
weight-watchers. They want to know
the weight of the calf produced, its rate
of growth after weaning, the degree of
“finish,” and the percentage of muscle
in the fat-free carcass. The producer
is also very interested in the fertility
of his cattle. He doesn’t want to pay
a lot of money for a bull that is nearly
sterile or carry cows that can’t con-
ceive.
Calf weight reflects the dam’s milk
production and maternal ability. For
meaningful comparisons the calves
should be weighed at not less than six
months of age and should have been
born within three months of each other.
The calves of heifers must be matched,
seconds with seconds, and so on. Rate
of growth after weaning is a particularly
pertinent measurement. It indicates an
animal’s inherent efficiency in feed use
and ability to thrive under the prevail-
ing conditions. This measurement
should be taken over the period from
when the weaners first begin making
steady weight gains until they have put
on at least 1001 b. Standard procedures
for mustering and weighing will have to
be laid down and adopted by every-
body, but the animals need not be
fasted.
Finish can be measured in milli-
metres fro'm the thickness of the back-
fat. The ratio of muscle to bone in the
fat-free carcass is not so readily ascer-
tainable, but the experts say it varies
widely from one beast to another and
so is a very fruitful source of improve-
ment in beef production by selective
breeding. Research will be continued in
the hope of finding an easy method of
deriving this ratio in both live and
slaughtered animals. Measurements
made on the shin are some guide.
The committee would like to see
studs set up a system for exchanging
groups of ani'mals so that their perform-
ance can be compared under identical
conditions. Certification of the fertility
of bulls offered for sale would be an-
other desirable development in the in-
dustry. A major break with the past
could be made immediately if studs
simply provided figures on the rate of
post-weaning gain only. It will be even
more interesting to see the rate at
which studs install scales and submit to
having their beasts weighed under offi-
cial scrutiny.
The merino studs didn’t exactly fall
over themselves some 15 yfears ago in
a race to buy fleece-weighing scales
when a similarly scientific system of
selection was presented to them. And
at the outset they were pro’mised that,
if they adopted the proposals, they
could double or even treble the rate of
improvement of the merino as a wool-
grower. The beef man, on the other
hand, cannot be given an equally attrac-
tive target at this stage, because the
heritabilities of the several traits con-
trolling meat production are not known
precisely. The figures for heritability
can only be calculated after enough
data of the type indicated by the com-
mittee has been collected.
Pressure will be exerted on the beef
studs to accept selection by measure-
ment when feed-lot production methods
become more common. Margins for
error in this line of business are pretty
mean. Guesswork 'must be minimised.
A difference in dressing out of three
percent can break a man. An equally
critical calculation is how long the
cattle will have to be maintained in
the feed-lot to reach market weight
with the right degree of finish. Vital
considerations such as these are going
to emphasise measurement right along
the line.

Plenty of
good things in
the hock shop
IT OCCURRED to me that amidst
all the drum-thumping and bugle-
blowing going on about our reds
lately, we have forgotten about the
whites, some of which represent the
best value in the country.
I like red wine, too. I like Australian
red wine, for its flavor and robustness,
for its quality and character, and for
its future a future that the present
de'mand will not compromise, I trust.
But lately I’ve had it brought home
to me that we make some damn fine
white wine, too.
Equipment may have something to
do with it. Many of our companies
are quick to use some ite'm which is
being tried with success overseas. A
lot of this new equipment is applied
better to white-wine making than red.
Great reds, with all the inherent
development of zonal varieties most
suitable for the soil and the wine-
maker’s tradition of simple skill, are
less affected by new ideas and develop-
ments.
This does not 'mean that the reds are
lacking or that there is no progress
being made with them. It means
simply that the other results are more
obvious and apparent. More is hap-
pening.
I split the whites up into two broad
categories, those that most of the
shows use. Chablis and white burgundy
style as one class, hock style as the
other. In the former we use varieties
that are most suitable in our climate
and are proven material in Australia,
semilion (or Hunter River riesling) and
white shiraz (or ugni blanc, white her-
mitage, trebbiano, St. Emilion). In
addition, varieties such as white pinot,
verdhelho, and the blanquette of the
Hunter are proving most adaptable for
this style, and we shall see a lot more
of these in the future.
The classic hock-style wine is that
■made from rhine riesling. In addition,
we make some fine wines of this type
from traminer, Clare riesling, and
frontignac. Even the übiquitous semilion
can be used, if carefully handled, as
hock material, though the result lacks
the fragrant floweriness of those wines
made from the other varieties.
But we have been using these grapes
for years, you say, what are you carry-
ing on about?
In the first place, as I have said,
they seem to be making them better.
In the chablis/white burgundy cate-
gory, Lindeman’s, McWilliam’s, and
Penfold’s have worked wonders in the
past ten years. Regard the 3270 white
burgundy that Lindeman’s f made last
year, an outstanding soft, full-flavored
white wine that will still develop. It
cost $1.45 then. In spite of all the
flavor and bouquet there, it was still
delicate and fresh. Then the 365 pinot
riesling of any year from Penfold’s
and the Anne rieslings from McWil-
liam’s. Ignore the names, the riesling
is a euphemism for semilion and is not
to be confused with rhine riesling. The
smaller makers of the Hunter, Drayton,
Tyrrell, Elliott, and Tulloch, all make
excellent semilion wines, most of which
benefit from a couple of years bottle
age.
But there are other grapes and other
areas. Penfold’s have evolved a distinct
style with their blanquette grape over
the past ten years, and now these wines
are unique, with their full fruit flavor
and tart finish. The verdhelho of
Lindeman’s is used to fill out se'millon
of a light year, or it can be made
separately, as in ’67. Both of these
wines are full of flavor, yet both
remain delicate, with no hint of coarse-
ness.
Houghton’s and, recently, Orlando
are also doing wonders with semilion.
Though their wines are fuller and per-
haps softer, they are balanced and have
pronounced style. They are not quite
as delicate as the others, but the flavor
compensates.
A lot of this has come about by the
use of bag presses and centrifuges. The
bag press, though awkward to fill, is
undoubtedly extremely gentle with the
material. The centrifuge removes all
waste matter from the juice. Delicacy
is the result. There has also been much
work done to eliminate oxidisation. The
result freshness, delicacy, preserva-
tion of flavor.
And it is not just a matter of the
best wines being handled this way. Try
Penfold’s white burgundy and Dalwood
chablis, which still sell for less than
a dollar a bottle. Try the Linde'man’s
two number wines. I have been drink-
ing a lot of these wines lately, and I
am continually gratified by their
quality. Pity they had to raise the
price.
The advances are even more spec-
tacular in the second category, the
hock style. Gramp’s have been spend-
ing a great deal of money on equip-
ment. They were the first to develop
in a big way the controlled refrigera-
tion-pressure-tank system in the early
’fifties, and the remarkable Barossa
rieslings were the result. Now they have
the CO2 press, which, in my opinion,
will further affect and improve our
standards. A comparatively simple piece
of equipment, designed, I believe, by
a Scottish engineer in South Africa, this
press handles material so kindly that
the extracted juice is almost clear
CONNOISSEUR
TABLE WINES
NOTES FROM LINDEMANS
CELLAR MANAGER:
During these days of table wine popu-
larity, it is fashionable to decry ports,
muscats and sweet sherries as a hang-
over from the unpleasant past when
fortified wines represented the cheapest
form of alcohol, and quality in many
cases was very low.
And yet, how much these people are
■missing. It can truthfully be said that a
man cannot consider hi'mself a con-
noisseur of wine until he appreciates
port and other dessert wines. Not, mind
you, to drink in large quantities, but as
after dinner drinks in lieu of concocted
liqueurs, or, for that matter, on any
other occasion.
The Corowa-Rutherglen area, straddling
the River Murray in the southern Riv-
erina, is famed for the quality of its des-
sert wines, and is probably the foremost
area in the world for production of
superb liqueur-like muscats and frontig-
nacs.
Lindemans have been established at
Corowa for nearly a hundred years, and
our two main vineyards there are “Fel-
ton” and “Southern Cross” with the
winery itself within the town limits.
Here are produced our Flor Sherries,
Cream Sherry, Macquarie Port and
Raisin Liqueur Muscat, each a uni-
form blend of aged wine.
This uniformity and consistency of style
is obtained by blending the wines pro-
gressively over many years in a modi-
fied solera syste'm, whereby different
wines of different ages are brought
together for the final blend. In turn
each of the base blends is kept to a
constant age, quantity and style by
topping up with younger wine, as each
draw-off is made.
We have recently commenced mai'ket-
ing a little of each of some of the oldest
soleras in the various blends, identifying
the wines by the number or identity of
the Corowa solera.
Solera RFI contains tawny port, and
its wine is marketed as “Reserve Tawny
Port RFI.”
Similarly Reserve Muscat 1625, Re-
serve Amorosa Cream Sherry Z9S, Re-
serve Madeira 1940 and Reserve Amon-
tillado Sherry ZB9BA.
It is impossible to give an age to such
wines, but all are extremely old, with
the Muscat 1625 probably the oldest.
All the soleras have consistently won
Gold Medals and Ist prizes at the vari-
ous Royal Shows, and in ’many cases,
a Gold Medal when young is manda-
tory for any wine to be even considered
for admission at a later stage to the
solera.

enough to bottle. Well, I said al’most.
John Vickery at Leo Buring’s is res-
ponsible, too, for an outstanding range
of rhine rieslings and rhine riesling/
semilion blends. George Kolarovich, one
of the most thoughtful 'makers in the
country, has brought the Kaiser-Stuhl
rhine rieslings to the fore. Ben Chaffey
with his Seaview wines, and Cyril
Henschke up at Keyneton, are other
makers of delightful rhine rieslings.
And watch for the new Coonawarra
rhine riesling from Mildara.
But that grape doesn’t have the Hock
shop to itself. The Penfold’s traminers
and traminer riesling blends consistently
take top awards, and Henschke’s
frontignac won a Gold and best white
or something at the last Melbourne
Show. These are all top wines of tre-
mendous merit. And I believe they are
getting better all the time.
In the second place (I haven’t for-
gotten), those wines from overseas that
I have been tasting are pretty awful.
Though some of the reds from Chile,
the Argentine, Spain, Portugal, and
Italy have much merit, the whites have
had none. They are either sulphurous
or oxidised. Flavor is flat and un-
appealing and most of the wines are
coarse.
Even so'me of the export German:
and French wines are poor, and seem
to be getting worse as the American
demand builds. Some of the name
German whites I’ve seen recently are
third-grade material tasting like lolly
water. Which doesn’t mean that I
don’t respect their great wines. A top
German hock or moselle is still a
supreme pleasure; a top white burgundy
still makes me yearn for millionaire
status. But many of their other wines,
fa’mous names and styles included, are
no better than many of the wines that
we are making today, and most of them
are not as good.
Which doesn’t mean that I don’t
think we can get better. With all the
new methods and processes available
(and still being used) I would still
like to see some wood maturation
taking place with the white burgundy
wines. The great old wines of Great
Western and the Hunter all spent some
time in wood, and these wines are
still the ones that got nearest to that
lovely full honey character so much
desired. I would still like to see more
depth of palate, intensity of flavor if
you like, in the middle of the rhine
riesling wines. McWilliam’s are the only
ones to have done this yet, in my
opinion, and they did it with sauvignon
blanc.
Finally, a word for the sponsor.
Much of this improvement is due to
the show system and individual judges.
There is some healthy dissatisfaction
with some aspects of the circuit, but
no one should deny some of the con-
tributions made. The Fairbrothers,
Fornachons, Seabrooks, and Komons
have done a great deal in recent years
to encourage and abet this improvement
in standards, and I, for one, am grate-
ful for it.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Getting the most out of music
By KENNETH ROBINS
FAR TOO much orchestral concert-
going in this country has developed into
a rather dreary ritual. Dispirited audi-
ences file into civic auditoria chained
by the tyranny of the subscription
ticket and settle down to a performance
in which the only animation is shown
by the conductor.
Admittedly the average age of our
concert subscribers precludes any rap-
ture, careless or otherwise, but there are
youngsters in the orchestra itself who
have adopted the outwardly phlegmatic
mien of their older colleagues. I am
not suggesting that they do not play
the notes, for indeed they do, and very
well, too, but their reluctance to allow
any flicker of involvement to show on
their faces creates a barrier between the
players and the audience as it surely
must between the players and the music.
On the whole, recital audiences
exhibit 'more vitality and this could be
due to the obvious involvement of the
performer, for, if I am right in my
theory, the communication with the
audience under these circumstances
would then be stronger. Nevertheless,
even recitals by celebrities are all too
predictable. The. technique will be
fluent, the presentation beautifully
calculated and stylistically sound, and
sadly the effect can be arid; for per-
fection often carries with it a corres-
ponding chill. This is not to deny that
the greatest thrills of the season will in
all likelihood come from the concerts
sponsored by the ABC or the Musica
Viva; for the orchestra is still capable
of being galvanised into memorable
essays by some conductors, and in
recitals and chamber music we will
hear performers of the first rank.
Yet the fact remains that the lack of
involvement by our audiences in the
established concert series is obvious.
The real evidence of our musical 'mat-
urity is in the altruism which prompts
the work of our indigenous groups such
as Norman Johnston’s Oriana Singers,
Charles Colman’s Leonine Consort, the
University groups, the Schubert and
Mozart Societies, and the musical may-
hem (courageous or misguided, depend-
ing on your point of view) of the dedi-
cated International Society for Con-
temporary Music. These folk attract
audiences which are far from apathetic
and although the performances range
from the chaotic to the immaculate,
the audience involve'ment is always
genuine and palpable.
Surely the only excuse for commit-
ting one’s body to discomfort in a con-
cert hall in the most inclement season
of the year is to gain something which
cannot be experienced from the gramo-
phone, for, with the exception of the
work of contemporary composers, most
music of significance see’ms to be avail-
able on record. What one does gain
from attendance at a concert is pri-
marily a unique experience; unless the
performance is recorded it will never
be heard again which, of course, could
be a tragedy or a blessing.
The other aspect, that of liaison or
involvement, is more difficult to ana-
lyse. Many people are inclined to rub-
bish this notion with cries of “mystic-
ism” or “romantic nonsense” but I am
convinced the conception is valid. That
an audience of active listeners is a
genuine stimulus to most performers
is incontestable, and few of them, the
performers that is, will be convinced
that the audience plays no part in the
performance.
I feel this state of affairs is more
likely to occur in an intimate atmos-
phere; the aesthetically pleasing sur-
roundings of Sydney’s Cell Block
theatre, for instance, see'm to promote
e'xtroversion on the part of the most
taciturn of our instrumentalists. How-
ever, I have seen an audience in the
Sydney Town Hall electrified by the
sight of the London Symphony Orches-
tra storming on to the platform: so if
our professional musicians would re-
nounce the idea that it is un-Australian
to show enthusiasm for the job, we
could look forward to the larger halls
always being centres of delight.
What is important to Australia’s
music is what we do and how we do
it in Australia. This is not a parochial
attitude; we are no longer isolated
from the great stream of Western music
and it is time we hopped off the bank
into the water. What is equally import-
ant, is that we are seen to hop off the
bank.

Theatre
Repaying a public loyalty
By ROBERT WARD
Green Julia. Paul Ableman. Theatre 62,
Hilton.
The General. Leonard Radic. AMP
Theatre, Adelaide.
y-K-Mvn-T-A 4-tit a i j j
CONTEMPLATING the sudden
rn
emergence of Adelaides Theatre 62 as
a genuine, working, professional theatre
company, one cannot help stopping
short of exaltation to wonder if the
miracle will last. When Theatre 62
commenced in 1962 it was really just
another theatre group, albeit with its
own theatre, and a permanent director
in John Edmund, who in those days
earned some kind of a living through
the Theatre’s associate drama school.
During the first six years of its existence
it presented some 45 plays, but hap-
hazardly, I always felt. Occasionally
there would be lay-offs when other com-
pames would use the theatre. The stan-
dard of presentation varied from quite
good to muddling, and the program
was conventional.
In 1967, with the addition of Richard
Davey as a director, one could see signs
of increasing activity, but this was cer-
tainly not enough to prepare one for
the sudden emergence of Theatre 62
to the pre-eminent position it now
holds. For 1968 they plan 18 produc-
tions. It is strange to think that while
the affluent and subsidised South Aus-
tralian Theatre Company cannot see its.
way clear to employ a permanent group
of players, Theatre 62 has worked
itself to the position where-it not only
has a company of six players and a
director but also such luxuries as a
publicity manager, a splendid new
coffee lounge for patrons, and a new
and comfortable foyer. It is the kind
of develop'ment one would really have
expected only in a larger city, and it
is the result of hard work and tenacity,
and a satisfied and loyal regular audi-
ence.
At the moment the company has two
productions playing: Paul Ableman’s
“Green Julia” in the main theatre at
night, and Leonard Radic’s “The
General” at lunchtime in the AMP
Theatre.
“Green Julia” is really Paul Able-
man’s first play, following specialised
work for Peter Brook’s Theatre of
Cruelty. It is not at all a profound
dramatic work, but it is very funny and,


in John Edmund’s production, very well
played, although the production falls
down in final polish by ill-chosen
furniture and objects. This is a beset-
ting fault at Theatre 62, for there never
seems to be enough attention paid to
detail and design.
Leonard Radic is a Melbourne
journalist. His “The General” is a one-
act play in which a retired English
Army officer believes that World
War 111 is about to break out and that
he will shortly be called to lead Eng-
land to a glorious victory. His family
is somewhat disturbed by the extent of
the General’s delusions, and privately
decide to have him committed to a
mental hospital. While they are lead-
ing the conversation around to the
subject, a dispatch rider arrives with
orders for the General which require
him to report for duty forthwith.
I suspect that one is supposed to draw
all kinds of fascinating metaphysical
and political conclusions from this play,
but I must say I couldn’t. In fact I
found it a rather pointless, implausible
exercise. Gordon Poole’s General, how-
ever, has a nice blustering manner, and
June Hefferan’s ’mini-skirted secretary
is sweetly adenoidal. On the whole it
is an adequate performance all round,
with Jonathan Leigh’s production work-
ing very smoothly. The Orderly Room
set is a bad mistake. It calls for a
standard of realism only a really first-
class scenic artist could achieve effec-
tively, and one must ask whether it is
necessary at all to mount such elaborate
sets for lunch-hour one-acters.
ADELAIDE, the exciting capital of
Australian culture, has always been
rather proud of its taste for enduring
works of art like the “William Tell
Overture,” Hans Heysen tree studies,
and Terence Rattigan plays. So you
will understand that it’s hard for us
to accept radical innovation or ex-
periment in theatre. On the contrary,
and especially with classics, we’ve come
to expect and respect the standards of
Henry Irving, played small. Well, it
seems things have changed overnight.
Innovation is with us, for the South
Australian Theatre Company, nee
Elizabethan Theatre Trust, has inven-
ted mini-Shakespeare.
Mini - Shakespeare happens when
“Macbeth” plays one hour and 22
minutes, and when, after interval,
“Hamlet” takes another hour and some
17 minutes; when the producer’s pro-
gram note tells us the play “gains in
concentration,” and when everyone
gets out in time for coffee, just be-
fore 11 p.m. It is the absolute in
abridgement and I think it is worthy
of a tribute from the international staffs
of “Reader’s Digest.”
One rather vulgar private critic sug-
gested in the foyer afterwards that
is was less mini and more emasculated
Shakespeare. But then he came from
interstate. Most nice people, including
the Press, were delighted with the
grand job SATC and the producer,
Richard Campion, had done. For in-
stance, only the most popularly known
soliloquies were left in the text, and
these were nicely given without any
tedious academic regard for metre,
rhythm, or color, just plainly and
bluntly. Furthermore, there was no
trouble about characters, because too
little of the text remained for there
to be effective delineation, argument,
and development.
The actors were dressed in skivvies
by Onkaparinga, slacks by Kentish,
and a few lengths of curtain material
draped nonchalantly around their
shoulders. For special effects, as with
Polonius, there were tight trousers, a
balaclava, and what looked like a
piece of blanket. Then for regal dis-
play, and displaying a nice sense of
the fitness of things, modernity was
put aside for the more appropriate
robe and papiermache crown. It was
splendidly economical.
But to be plain and serious, this
production was a shamefully inept
exercise. Tasteless, crudely acted,
badly moved, it was quite worthless
as an introduction to live Shakespeare
for high-school students. It would
probably never have received critical
notice had it not been presented to
an adult and paying audience at the
Teachers’ College theatre at the end of
its touring season.
How much it cost in Elizabethan
Trust cash to produce and send the
cast on tour through the State, I don’t
know certainly enough to provide
every high school visited with an Argo
recording of the two plays.
Films
Breaking with
the past
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
La Guerre Est Finie. Director, Alain
Resnais.
Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner?
Director, Stanley Kramer.
RESNAIS, whose “Last Year In
Marien’bad” showed New Wave film-
making at its most affected and e’mpty,
seems now to have developed into an
articulate, original, and individual
director. “La Guerre Est Finie” is un-
doubtedly one of the most impressive
films seen this year.
Resnais’ preoccupation has always
been with time and memory, the inter-
action of the past on the present. The
theme reaches its highest expression in
this story of a Spanish expatriate who,
since the Civil War, has been working
with a small band of loyalists to re-
store political freedom to Spain. But
he is tiring, aging; he realises that their
noble struggle has degenerated into a
foolish, dangerous game. Yet he cannot
give up, much as he wishes; to do so
would make nonsense of the values that
have sustained hi'm for most of his
life. In the end he leaves on yet another
mission to Spain, which may well be
his last.
It’s a perceptive and moving study of
a man’s inability to break emotionally
with a past which he intellectually rea-
lises is dead and gone. Particularly im-
pressive are the scenes between the
burnt-out revolutionary and the young
hotheads enthusiastically mouthing the
familiar battlecries. In Yves Montand,
Resnais has found the perfect embodi-
ment of his central character, with his
wry humor, disillusioned dedication,
and basic despair.
The love scenes are beautifully con-
trasted; the man’s casual tumbling of a
willing young girl is shown as purely
physical, whereas the sequence of his
love-making with his true lover (Ingrid
Thulin) has both passion and poetry.
Stanley Kramer’s reputation as one of
the profound thinkers of American
Yves Montand and Genevieve Bujold
in “La Guerre Est Finie”
cinema will hardly be enhanced by
“Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner?”
although it’ll probably make more
money than all his other movies put
together. Not that it isn’t a very pleas-
ant movie, with smart dialogue and a
most attractive cast; but it reduces an
explosive subject racial intermarriage
to the level of a sophisticated
comedy, wisecracking and shrugging
away a problem that can only be solved
by facing it and, if necessary, fighting
about it.
Katharine Hepburn and Spencer
Tracy play resolutely liberal parents
who are nevertheless taken aback when
their daughter, following their precepts
rather more literally than they like,
announces she’s going to marry a
Negro. Well, everyone’s so pleasant that
you just know it’s going to turn out all
right, particularly since the Negro holds
all the winning cards. He’s strikingly
handsome, beautifully 'mannered and
dressed, is an official of the World
Health Organisation, and an authority
on tropical medicine. In fact, he’s a
ruddy marvel, and the wonder is that
he bothered with this rattle-brained girl.

CRAFTS AND COMMUNICATIONS
MAN WITHOUT WHEELS
ARMED WITH two years’ supply of
photographs and $4000 worth of
camera equipment, two young Sydney
freelance photographers have begun
publishing a bi-monthly magazine
called “Rucksack,” which will “por-
tray man in a more natural scene than
the one he has synthesised.”
In an editorial which must appeal
to the pioneering spirit which people
keep saying is hidden beneath the grey
suit of the Australian city dweller,
Gary Steer and John Davis continue:
“Ideas shape action. If we can reveal
the joys of involvement in action, we
will have achieved our objective . . .
The experience of carrying your own
food and shelter fascinates. Indepen-
dent of the trappings of a more binding
social system, you are free to travel,
to explore ... to satisfy an innate
curiosity about the world in which we
live.”
The fact that its editors believe in
being independent of society’s trappings
is evidenced by “Rucksack’s” very
existence. Both gave up jobs — Steer
was a public relations officer for the
Royal Agricultural Society, John was
a chemical engineer — to bring out
a magazine that costs $600 an issue
to produce.
“We’re printing 2000 copies,” Davis
told us. “If we sell all those, we make
a small profit. We can’t tell from the
first issue because we gave a lot of
copies away to make people aware of
us. But we’re sure we have the market.
There are so many bushwalking,
canoeing, and rock-climbing clubs here
and in New Zealand — 80 or 90 in
the Sydney metropolitan area alone.”
All is accomplished in a necessarily
rambling old house on the North Shore,
which is home to both the magazine
and its editors—although the magazine
seems to have captured the lion’s share
of the accommodation. The walls are
papered with pictures of rock-climbers
in various stages of precariousness, and,
downstairs, Davis and Steer have in-
stalled a darkroom to process their
photographs. “Actually, we started
the magazine partly as a market for
our pictures. Outdoor photographs
are our main interest, but up to now
there haven’t been many places where
we could sell them.”
Both were at university when they
decided photography held more
interest for them than either Arts or
chemical engineering. Steer is still
carrying on a part-time Arts course
and Davis completed his course, work-
ing for a time at CSR.
“It was a narrow field, the same
things, the same people, so I gave it
up. I had to give up a few of my ideas,
too, of course — no more high rent,
expensive car — liabilities like those.
You have to work your guts out if
you’re going to do something like this.”
“All kinds of people belong to bush-
walking, canoeing, and rock-climbing
clubs,” Davis said. “The majority are
young people, but,” he added, unrolling
a beautifully detailed large-scale color
map, “this was sent to us by a retired
music professor who’s 76. It traces a
53-mile canoeing trip he did down the
Hastings River.”
Gary Steer is 26, stocky, well built —
the antithesis of John Davis’ ranginess.
Steer likes to photograph wildlife, while
Davis is a rock-climbing expert who’s
scaled everything from the N.S.W. Art
Gallery to Ball’s Pyramid, which rises
1800 feet out of the sea on Lord Howe
Island.
And could they define the fascination
of climbing? “It’s physical and mental
exercise,” Steer put in. “And heights
fascinate everyone. Also, it’s the chal-
lenge of starting from the bottom of
something. That goes for anything —
climbing, photography, or publishing
a magazine.”
THE ZERO STATE
NIKHIL BANERJEE is due in Aus-
tralia this week to give a series of sitar
recitals, and the publicity handouts
contain a copy of a criticism from “The
Times,” London, from which the follow-
ing extract on the aim of Indian
music is taken: “A kind of purposeless-
ness is what it strives for, an approxi-
mation of the zero state. After all else
is explained the answer to a final ‘why’
can only be an experience of totality.”
This mystical flight seems to be an-
other example of the commodity which
has upset the parents, or the girls, or
both, at Manly High. It seems an odd
way to approach an age-old art which
is a perfect wedding of freedom and
discipline; to treat it as an incitement
to euphoria is a sad reflection on the
artistic mores of our time.
What we expect to hear is a great
musician and instrumentalist doing
something which is not divorced from
what Charlie (The Bird) Parker did
in Minton’s in Harlem or what Johann
(Sebastian) Bach did in the organ loft
of St. Thomas’ in Leipzig. The lan-
guage will be recognisably the same
although the accent may be widely dif-
ferent.
The only type of person who is
likely to stomach “The Times” man’s
effusion would no doubt comment,
“Man, that’s for real” which, of course,
means the opposite.
EVALUATING THE EPILOGUE
WHEN the Rev. Douglas Tasker uses
the word “mass” it’s usually as an
adjective for media. For Tasker, a
crew-cut, plain-clothed Presbyterian, is
director of Victoria’s Christian Televi-
sion Association, an organisation dedi-
cated “to make the widest and most
effective use of radio and TV in carry-
ing the churches’ witness to the com-
munity” and “to the establishment of
a Christian Communications Centre for
research into the best religious use of
fcnass media for the development of a
theology of communication.”
Apart from sponsorship, Australian
churches have the use of free statutory
time amounting to 13,000 hours a year
on commercial radio and 1000 hours
a year on commercial television. De-
ploring the technical ineptness of the
religious material that fills most of these
availabilities, Tasker warns the churches
that “in the modern world of publicity
and public relations no institution can
avoid being evaluated and compared
with others engaged in similar tasks.”
Preaching the audio-tactile gospel of
McCluhan, Tasker has applied elec-
tronic techniques to evangelism im-
pressively. Since 1959 there have been
more than 1000 CTA programs, rang-
ing in length from 30 seconds to 30
minutes, and they’ve been generally in-
ventive and sometimes controversial.
Normie Rowe sang his banned ver-
sion of “It Ain’t Necessarily So” for
CTA, There have been programs com-
piled frotn violent newsreel footage and
candid man-in-the-street interviews.
Joyce Grenfell, Barry Jones, Bob
Dylan, and Len French have made ap-
pearances, while Tommy Hanlon, cos-
tu'med as a clown, contributed a half-
hour feature on satire and humor in the
New Testament. Now Graham Kennedy
is considering a Tasker script.
Deploring amateurism in television,
Tasker insists on paying the many pro-
fessional actors who appear in such
programs as “Religious on the Cam-
pus,” “Pulp Religion,” and “Is God
Dead?” In fact, Tasker is so dedicated
to professionalism that he’ll program an
eloquent agnostic in preference to an
inarticulate Christian.
CELLAR LIBERALISM
UBU FILMS, the Sydney outfit which
is the most assiduous maker and pusher
of underground films in Australia, has
just taken delivery of another batch of
the American product for screening in,
presumably, selected cellars.
Bulk of the new program is made up
of films by Bruce Connor, a 35-year-old
god of the underground generation.
Among his films to be screened in Aus-
tralia are “Looking for Mushrooms,” a
color drug fantasy; “Report,” an irrev-
erent comment on President Kennedy’s
assassination (“one person in every
15,000 is likely to have an epileptic
seizure as a result of watching this
film”); and a short called “Breakaway,”
in which a young woman dances naked.
“It is believed that the censor has
shown new liberality in allowing the
dancer’s breasts and pubic hair to be
seen,” huffs a UBU handout.
Connor made the film with a $10,000
grant from the Ford Foundation, which
might be taken to indicate a new liber-
ality in philanthropy.

Art
When art is
in the choice
By ELWYN LYNN
Marcel Duchamp. Art Gallery of
N.S.W., Sydney.
THERE ARE odder aspects to Marcel
Duchamp, born in 1887 and still mak-
ing his life an ironic antidote to art,
than that the Mary Sisler collection
of 78 of his works, notes, and ready-
mades comprises more than a fifth of
his life work. In 1946 he said that he
had abandoned painting in 1912 he
began in 1902 because “I was inter-
ested in ideas not merely in visual
products. I wanted to put painting once
again at the service of the mind.” Paint-
ing was too retinal; even Matisse was
insufficiently cerebral for Duchamp.
Ducha’mp, who had painted in a
squashy Cezannesque mode, that would
have made him a pioneer-hero in Aus-
tralia, had good reason to tire of his
own flaccid paintings well represented
in this selection; but in 1911 and 1912
he had changed styles, here anticipated
with the clarified Cubism of Apropos
of a Little Sister, to produce the
Futurist-Cubism of Sad Young Man in
a Train, The King and Queen Sur-
rounded by 'Swift Nudes, and the two
versions of Nude Descending a Stair-
case, the second creating such a suc-
cess de scandale in New York’s Armory
show in 1913 that it became the most
cartooned painting of the century.
Duchamp stopped painting and began
to make those remarks so suitable to
our present situation ($40,000 asked
for Drysdale’s The Cricketers and
$35,000 got for Nolan’s Burke and
Wills): that success destroys and art
becomes a status symbol with fine re-
sale value. Commercialisation see'ms to
have destroyed the foundations of
another of his complaints the treat-
ment of an artist as the last word in
divinity.
Though Duchamp became the coolest
artist around, all that he said and did
was highly personal; in his ready-
mades, ironical laws of physics, and in
the presentation of his urinal, bicycle
wheel on a stool, snow shovel, and hat-
racks (now in “editions”) he had a
new detachment akin to that of Noland,
Warhol, or Syd Ball. When he is funky
it’s not to make the flesh creep as does
a Kienholz or a Conner (his decayed
body on a sofa is now repulsively fas-
cinating visitors to the Tate); his pink
falsie on black velvet, called Please
Touch, his hand-made mould of the
female form undivine, and his chastity
wedge are like all his witticisms, mildly
amusing trifles. But savage satire was as
outside his program as was emotional in-
volvement; however, puns, like Fresh
II id me for his french window and
anagrams like Anemic Cinema for his
camera, don’t wear well and his female
pseudonym, Rrose jSelavy (C’est la vie),
as an alter ego must make any psycho-
analyst ask about his renunciations and
lack of commitment.
The detached attitude has led to the
neglect of the artistic features of ready-
made, and Dada and Surreal objects
have been treated as merely didactic.
Duchamp is not preaching on Decent
Design with his ready-mades; he is,
on the other hand, no clown for the
Dali set, but plays an important part
in serious culture, and if he stresses
the superiority of life over art, this is
not because he thinks ready-mades just
symbols of experience and protest.
When his Urinal of 1917 in glossy
editions today was rejected as
plagiarism, he alleged that the art was
in the choice. “He took an ordinary
article of life, placed it so that its
useful significance disappeared under
the new title (Fountain) and point of
view created a new thought for
that object.” That art is choice he
emphasised by imposing a limit on the
number of ready-mades he would select.
Two large glass cases contain the
documentation (!?) of his The Bride
Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even,
begun in 1915 and left in a “definitive
stage of incompletion” in 1923; locked
between sheets of glass, it is now in
Philadelphia, but the Sislef collection
contains the studies of the Malic
Moulds (to represent the bachelors)
and they give some notion of what
Duchamp means by a non-symbolic
cerebral art.
We cannot go into all that here;
it needs to be noted that Duchamp
was much influenced by Picabia’s and
Ernst’s “mechanical” paintings and that
Duchamp’s own influence had to await
the propitious moment, about 1958. He
had clearly influenced Matta, Gorky,
Johns, Rauschenberg (his Trophy II is
dedicated to Duchamp), and Olden-
burg. Duchamp’s ball of string between
metal plates with an unknown rattling
object inside recalls Oldenburg’s buried
“sculpture” in New York last year.
Art’s hidden mysteries. His Rotary
Demi-Sphere of 1925 in this show and
his Rota-Reliefs of 1935 anticipate
kinetic art, his Coeurs Volants pre-
dicted Vasarely, and his Bottle Rack or
Hedgehog foreshadows the serial repeti-
tion of much modern sculpture. No
one can now look at the Mona Lisa
without adorning her with Duchamp’s
moustache, and, if you can, you must
know that he did exhibit an unadorned
print of her labelled “Clean-shaven.”
He is surrounded by myths, so here
is another. Art he thought too much
revered. “I’m an agnostic when it comes
to art. I don’t believe in it with all the
mystical trimmings.” A few months
after his Melbourne showing we had
vicars saying that they were agnostics
when it came to God’s existence. Like
lots of people of all worlds, they can
do without the mystical trimmings.


Child’s play
War games, almost a perennial ... cowboys and Indians
or simply goodies v. baddies
IN A changing world, the games that children play are
changeless and eternal. Hopscotch, marbles, tag, skip-
ping, cowboys and Indians, dressing-up . . . they’re a
few of the many games of simple improvisation which
outdistance commercialism and have their own secret
“seasons,” appearing magically one morning in parks,
playgrounds, and streets and then disappearing for a
while as if banished by some bush-telegraph alert. With
minor variations the scene is the same everywhere; these
children, though, were photographed in Sydney.

Dressing-up the irresistibility of imitating adults
Skipping- to a dozen or more different verse chants
Hopscotch with unwritten rules handed on through
generations of children


Water playtime’s endless fascinator
Tea party where adults see themselves

Marbles one of the most durable of boys’ games

BOOKS
Dr. K. and “the Micks”
By PETER COLEMAN
Intellectuals and Politics. Frank Knop-
felmacher. Nelson. $2.95.
IT IS A PARADOX of conservatism
that many conservatives do not recog-
nise some of their best allies. One of
the greatest British conservatives was
David Hume, but Dr. Johnson walked
out of the room in protest when Hume
walked in, and Edmund Burke only
agreed to speak to Hume because
civility and the deplorable “liberal state
of society” required it. The trouble was
that while Hume defended political
conservatism more deeply than Johnson
or Burke, he was also an intellectual,
a sceptic, an atheist. The conservatives’
abuse of Hume was outdone only by
the revolutionaries who, in France,
sponsored a special “History of Eng-
land” in an attempt to undermine
Hume’s powerful counter-revolutionary
influence.
It would at first glance be difficult
to find two more different men than
David Hume, the Scottish Calvinist
turned sceptic, who reflected on the
English Revolution and the Crom-
wellian Rule of the Saints, and Frank
Knopfelmacher, the Czech Jewish
refugee turned agnostic, who reflects on
East European revolutions and the
Rule of the Commissars. Yet both
reached similar conservative conclu-
sions about politics; both attacked the
corrosive influence of the Intellectuals
in the one case, the fanatical Cal-
vinists, the Cromwellians, the Saints,
the murderers of Stafford; in the other
the revolutionaries, the fellow-travellers,
the apparatchiks, the liquidators; and
both have been defamed by conserva-
tives for their pains in Knopfel-
macher’s case it would be hard to find
a Communist who has been defamed
as abominably as Knopfelmacher was
by some conservatives during the
Knopfelmacher affair at Sydney Uni-
versity a couple of years ago.
One cannot push the similarity too
far. Hume developed his political ideas
in his “History of England” while
Knopfelmacher’s method is the analysis
of types; one was a philosopher and
historian, the other is a psychologist
and ’moralist. Now that he has at last
produced a book of his essays, it is
possible to begin to judge his present
position.
The leading study in “Intellectuals
and Politics” is the essay of the same
name. It is long and hard to sum-
marise, but the essential argument is
this: the intellectual, unlike the expert
or the scientist (who may also be
intellectuals) is an easily recognisable
type peculiarly concerned with “criti-
cism of life,” with “the destiny of
man,” with “critique” to use three
of the standard phrases. “He is a
skilled wielder of verbal symbols and
concepts for the purpose of moral and
political discourse.” In other words, he
lives for general ideas and is a good
talker or writer. He is often hopeless in
practical affairs, his characteristic poli-
tical response is dissent, and he
flourishes under capitalist conditions
which loosen traditional bonds, stimu-
late freedom of thought, and provide
efficient means for the dissemination of
ideas.
The intellectual tends to fall into
one of three categories the revolu-
tionary, the bohemian, the sceptic. The
revolutionary intellectual is one whose
critique has led him to commit hi'mself
to a usually violent transformation of
society. He then ceases to practise
critique and becomes a technologist
of revolution. He is a self-destructive
(the culmination of his intellectual
career is abandoning the intellectual
life) and self-hating (he subordinates
himself to the proletariat or some other
group). If circumstances favor a revolu-
tion as in Russia, the new regime
crushes intellectuals and pro'motes
apparatchiks who have a real interest
in ideas but, as enforcers of orthodoxy,
not as free-wTeeling critics. If circum-
stances do not favor revolutions, as
has been -the case in the democracies,
the position is more complex. In the
’thirties, ’forties, and early ’fifties, the
Comintern purged the intellectuals and
promoted apparatchiks in the Parties
and “friends of the Soviet Union”
prelates, generals, scientists, or pre-
apparatchiks in the fronts. But since
the death of Stalin the revolutionary
intellectual has come into his own
again. He is an emissary of foreign
revolutions, loathes his own society,
including its “corrupt” working class,
and practises unending faction fights
(“Trotskyists, Maoists, Castroists,
anarchists, and plain nuts overlapping
with the non-revolutionary bohemia, are
held together only by their violent
hatred of capitalist democracy and by
a vague sort of love for the New
Emergent Forces”).
One of the distinctions Knopfel-
macher makes is between the revolu-
tionary intellectual and pre-apparat-
chik who, he says, is commonly confused
in Right-wing and anti-Com’munist
circles. The former, however squalid
his causes, is a sort of idealist who
may privately worry about defects in
Knopfelmacher . .. defamed by con-
servatives for his pains
the Soviet Union: if approached in
the right way, Knopfelmacher seems,
to 'believe, he may be rescued; the
latter is a status-craving opportunist
who sees in the Soviet Union’s cor-
ruption an opportunity for his own
advancement: he is a hopeless and more
dangerous type. It is easy to recognise
the two types in any big organisation,
not only in the Communist Party.
The second type of intellectual, the
non - revolutionary or “alienated,”'
bohemian revolutionary is not com-
mitted to a course of political action.
He is more critical, more sophisticated,
than the revolutionary and is usually
a better writer. He is the pro'moter of
the great ideology of permanent protest
and of alienation as the necessary
condition of intellectual life. According
to Knopfelmacher, alienation is an anti-
intellectual state, which induces not
proper critique but “distorting defen-
sive critique” from which flow “anxiety
and guilt-distorted rationalisations and
fantasies of punishment, release, and
revenge.” His characteristic attitude is
the empty gesture and his character-
istic language is ‘\vith-it” jargon.
The third type, which I have called
the scepfic, is the intellectual wbo is
neither alienated nor conventional, who
does not believe in an ultimate gim-
mick such as revolution which will
solve all problems, nor in permanent
protest without any rational program
of change; whose underlying state of
mind is concern and preoccupation
with the fragility of our institutions;


whose style of thought is ascetic,
autonomous, detached. The task of the
university teacher, according to Knop-
felmacher, is to cultivate this style of
thought, to arouse the impulse to
critique in the complacent, and to
cultivate ascetic analysis among the
alienates. This section of the essay is
the briefest and most disappointing: it
is only an outline and is vitiated by an
absurd choice of exemplars of the style
of thinking he means he selects
Lytton Strachey of all people! and
he writes as a man who has freed him-
self from the styles of thinking he
criticises but has not yet clarified his
new standards.
But, as if to compensate for this,
his next essay “Catholics and Com-
munists” is an illustration of what he
means. It is one of the best on this
subject I have read. He writes as an
outsider of both, although he once
had a short period in the Communist
Party in the Nazi period and he has
flirted with Catholicism: “Our culture,
our 'morality, our future as bearers of
the European civilisation are unthink-
able without the spirit of Catholicism,
which radiates from the Church’s ritual
and symbolism and from the history
of her martyrs and saints.” But the
study is about the Church’s attitude
to Communism and, in essence, he says
the traditionalist opposition to Com-
munism is sound but based on false
premises, whereas the liberal Catholic’s
“softness” on Communism is unsound
although based on correct premises.
Both commit the “seminarian fal-
lacies” that Communism is to be under-
stood in terms of its doctrine and this
doctrine is a variant of enlightened
secularism. In fact, totalitarianism does
not spring from Marxism and is the
ene'my of enlightened secularism. He
takes the 1937 encyclical of Pope Pius
XI to illustrate that although the Pope’s
hostility to Communism was of the
greatest significance, the understanding
of Communism in the encyclical is
much inferior to that of, say, Trotsky’s
“Revolution Betrayed,” also published
in 1937. The Pope, for example,
attacked Stalin for abandoning
restraints, preaching equality and
secularism at a time when, in fact,
Stalin was imposing the tightest
dictatorship the world had seen, institut-
ing systematic inequality and pursuing
policies not based on secular science
but on psychotic irrational ruthlessness.
The encyclical even compared Mexico
and Russia, as if the anti-clericalism
of the one was akin to totalitarianism
of the other.
The liberal Catholic, on the other
hand, Imagining that Communism is
a variant of rationalism, welcomes “dia-
logue” with it, which, in Knopfel-
macher’s view, is a betrayal of the
Church. “When Christ met the
adultress he forgave her, but he did
not enter into a dialogue on the pos-
sible virtues of sexual licence. When
Christ met the apparatchiks of the
Judean Church he castigated and
exposed them in parables of the most
uncompromising ferocity.”
But although Knopfelmacher rejects
the doctrines of both traditionalists and
liberals, he celebrates the Church’s
traditional role, in particular the con-
tribution to Australian political life of
the group which, with deliberate
abrasiveness, he calls “the Micks.” If
the Catholic liberals, he says, under-
mine the confidence of “the Micks,”
the Church’s influence in Australia
“would then rapidly come to an end.”
In a too brief sum'mary like this,
one cannot do justice to all Knopfel-
macher’s detailed arguments, particu-
larly when it is largely in the details
rather than the substantial points that
I disagree with him. (There are chap-
ters on Weber, on “Tolerance,” and
on “Conscience and Freedom,” which
have been published before in maga-
zines and which I have not mentioned.)
The book is one of those rare absorbing
things, the work-in-progress of a rest-
less mind, which leaves you wanting
to know what the next development of
his ideas will be. It also illustrates the
sort of intellectual excitement of which
the petty followers of Dr. Johnson and
Edmund Burke at Sydney University
helped to deprive their students.

American Art Since 1900, a critical
History. Barbara Rose. 281 plates,
37 in color; 320 pages. Thames and
Hudson. Hardcover, $5.50; paper-
back, $2.50.
SINCE the mid-’forties the new art of
America has produced an unprece-
dented phalanx of lively critics, ranging
from those like Sidney Tillim, William
Rubin, Robert Rosenblum, Lucy Lip-
pard, and Barbara Rose, who wish to
associate formal analysis with content,
and those like Clement Greenberg and
Michael Fried, whose narrow formalism
Miss Rose finds obnoxious. To one
side, ignored except for ritual maledic-
tions, stand Thomas Hess and Harold
Rosenberg, the champions of art as
crisis and the work of art as the
anxious object.
None of the accompanying critical
confrontation is found in her book
published last year, but in “Artforum”
(Feb., 1968) she attacked the formalists
for ignoring subject-matter and to the
question of why Greenberg could de-
scribe Picasso’s Charnel House without
referring to the grisly content she replied
that it was a matter of sublimation of
political issues -because Fried and
Greenberg (who was apparently an
old-time Trotskyite along with Rosen-
berg), so frustrated in their political
idealism, have turned to a criticism that
eschews any subject-matter. She
accuses Fried of a polemical virulence
in art criticism that uses the language
of Marxist cussing as well as the
Marxist ploy of condemnation by
reference to the social origin of ideas.
She could have noted the other
“Marxist” twist with Rosenberg in the
“New Yorker” (July 29, 1967), dis-
missing the new flat abstraction because,
with its lack of comment, it appeals to
the uncommitted middle classes.
Of Fried she points out something
more important, that he thinks art not
associated with the mainstream as
diversionary and his belief that those
who support the new, inevitable abstrac-
tion could not really support any other
kind of contemporary art; to do so is
just “bourgeois liberalism” and indulg-
ing in “nothing more than promiscuity
and irresponsibility verging on
nihilism.”
Miss Rose condemns the linear or
cyclical theory of modernist art that
she attributes to Greenberg and then
indulges in some virulence of her own:
“Criticism at present is dominated by
an element of the disenchanted Left,
led by Rosenberg and Greenberg, which
has managed to achieve a rapproche-
ment with the society it once rejected.
Traumatised by Stalinism, anaesthetised
by McCarthyism, and pacified by afflu-
ence, it has found a home, and a com-
fortable home at that in art criticism.”
They take criticism seriously in
America and such vehement espousals
of causes may be evident when Green-
berg visits Australia in May and June.
(His initial lectures will be at the Uni-
versity of Sydney, May 17, and at AMP
Theatrette, 8 p.m., May 21); but Miss
Rose’s book is a history as cool as her
husband’s Frank Stella’s thoroughly
formalist painting. There is more his-
tory in the early part and more evalua-
tion and interpretation in the last
chapters, but she simply reports on
Dine and Oldenburg, and her chapters
on architecture and sculpture are
mainly reference summaries.
The only other book in this field is
Sam Hunter’s of late 1959; his treat-
ment, more concerned with the artist
as person and with the varying intel-
lectual climate, shows how Miss Rose
indulges in some hindsight with Stuart
Davis and the optical twitches in Mon-
drian from her vantage of having lived
through Pop, Op, and the New Abstrac-
tion. She has had the advantage, too,
of Milton Brown’s 1963 book on the
Armory Show of 1913, but she gives
insufficient importance to Demuth’s
diaphanous watercolors that look for-
ward to Morris Louis’ stains. Apart
from that the survey is just short of
excellence. Like Hunter, she deals with
the attacks by the regionalist Benton on
the evils of internationalism (it all
recalls 1967 in Australia) but Hunter
does it with more understanding and
more stylishly, for Miss Rose is in such
a rush to be with the moderns that she
doesn’t often write so well as she does
on the refugee artists of the war years:
“To the dingy proletarian loft culture
of New York came the glittering cele-
brities of modern art whose names had

been legend and whose reproductions

Outstanding in her account is a fine
discussion on the rise of painterly
abstraction from Plofmann and Gorky,
the role of surreal auto'matism and
heroic imagery in the origin of abstract
expressionism, the relationship she finds
between Pollock, De Kooning, Gorky,
and Motherwell and how Rothgo, Still,
Newman, and Reinhardt were pre-
cursors to reductive abstraction. It is, in
fact, an art history that convincingly
shows the connections between works
of art; in comparison Henry Geld-
zahler’s “American .Painting in the
Twentieth Century” is little more than
a compart’mented catalogue.
As an anti-formalist critic she dodges
the issue when she says that post-
abstract-expressionist painters were
sceptical of communication through
abstract forms—a view that abstract
expressionists held to be not only pos-
sible but necessary; however, in her dis-
cussion, for example, of Morris Louis
she does suggest that the new abstrac-
tion has a content, however elusive.
She cannot trace the multiplicity of
influences, but she does indicate how
U.S. Pop was not Dada and how
Duchamp influenced Jasper Johns. She
deals with most of the abstractionists
in the Two Decades of American Paint-
ing of 1967 and adds Olitski and Darby
Bannard, but, despite her pleas for
catholicity, she gives but half a page to
12 realists (admittedly, she illustrates
five) and remains thoroughly main-
stream herself; no oddballs or mavericks
interrupt the ritual roll-call of honored
names.

The Heroic Journey of John McDouall
Stuart. lan Mudie. Angus and Rob-
ertson. $5.95.
MUDIE MAKES no effort to minimise
the defects of his lifetime hero, who,
thus presented, emerges somehow as the
more heroic for being little (five feet
six inches and weighing less than nine
stone); drunken when not on duty (and
perhaps sometimes then); plagued by
illness, probably a gastric ulcer; at times
irascible. Yet he was a superb leader
of men, a loyal and ungrasping servant
of both private and governmental mas-
ters; brave, conscientious, and most
engagingly delighted by natural phen-
omena of many kinds, both s'mall and
great.
Stuart ca’me from a family of soldiers,
but, because of his size, chose civil
engineering as a career. In 1839,
perhaps inspired by Sturt’s published
journals, he arrived in South Australia,
where comparatively little is known of
him until, in 1844, he joined Sturt’s
Mudie ... his lifetime hero
last expedition as draftsman. Sturt
thought highly of Stuart, who, while
never questioning Sturt’s leadership,
stored up for his own future a deter-
mination to avoid the sort of mistakes
he saw then. As Mudie says: “Each of
his expeditions would have more the
nature of a foray than of a campaign.”
Stuart on his journeys eschewed
everything likely to slow him down. For
him there would be no semi-permanent
depots, heavily laden drays, flocks of
potential meat to feed and drove, or
“flowery” journals. His men dried
bullock meat and carried it in their
packs. Somehow though, he always re-
mained, almost mystically, the leader.
A few men who could not accept his
rules and rule defected from various
expeditions —with a couple of excep-
tions he seems to have been well rid
of them, and those who remained nearly
all kept his memory revered until they
died.
Chambers and Finke, private pas-
toralists, financed Stuart’s 1858-59
sorties, during which he explored in the
Torrens basin and west of Lake Eyre.
In 1860, again with private backing, he
pushed north-west with only two com-
panions and 13 horses. He reached Cen-
tral Mount Stuart (he had wished to
name it Central Mount Sturt), which,
by his reckoning, was the centre of the
continent. He then retraced his steps
and rode north through the Murchison
and McDouall ranges to a watercourse
he called Attack Creek. Here the
apparent hostility of local tribesmen and
the punishing nature of the country
decided him to return to Adelaide. He
arrived in October; and in November,
1860, equipped this time by a grant
from the South Australian Government,
Stuart was off again, with 11 com-
panions and some 70 horses.
During all Stuart’s expeditions his
health would seem to have fallen far
below the standard one might suppose
essential. If his companions suffered
from meagre rations, he suffered more,
because scurvy affected his teeth so
that he could not chew dried meat or,
often, the native herbage and vege-
tables that somewhat ameliorated the
condition in the other men. He was
often too blind to survey efficiently
himself. Pain from his ailments was
torturing. On this triumphant journey,
his dream of crossing Australia from
south to north sustained him on his
trip toward the Indian Ocean, but only
his responsibilities to his party and
backers seems to have kept him going
(often by horse “ambulance”) on the
return trip. Yet he achieved what he
had dreamed of and without loss of a
man, indeed with amazingly few losses
of horses.
For various reasons his reputation
suffered a rapid decline soon after
the heady celebrations of his safe
return, and he died in England in
1866, aged only 50 but broken in health,
nearly blind, probably suffering a form
of brain damage. The building of
the Overland Telegraph Line along
the route he pioneered completely vindi-
cated Stuart and is his best monument.

Censor's games
At the risk of becoming a regular
stick for Beverley Tivey’s back, may I
again take issue with a re'mark made in
her film review, this time one concern-
ing Mai Zetterling’s film “Night
Games,” currently running in Sydney.
It is regrettable that the usually cauti-
ous Miss Tivey should have been taken
in by the tale currently circulating that
this film was cut by only 74ft., less than
one minute. A quick check with over-
seas sources would have revealed that
“Night Games” in France ran 104
minutes and in Britain 102 minutes,
whereas the local print runs for only
95 minutes. The print showing in Syd-
ney was rejected once by the Australian
censor,-sent to New Zealand for screen-
ing, where it was cut yet again, then
returned to the local distributor for
“reconstruction” before being passed,
with cuts, for local consumption. The
74ft. referred to was, I imagine, the
additional amount deleted by the cen-
sor from the distributor-engineered
“reconstruction,” a theory supported by
the fact that, in a previous case of this
kind - Roger Vadim’s “The Game Is
Over” the same distributor adver-
tised that “only a few seconds” had
been cut, when actually the film was
some minutes shorter than overseas ver-
sions. After a number of complaints to
the theatre manager, this piece of mis-
information was deleted from advertise-
ments.

Indiap Ocean threat
“Observer’s” article on the “Indian
Ocean threat” (8., May 4) tends to
ignore recent major changes in the
Near and Middle East and the conse-
quent reality. Russian-deployed con-
ventional armaments control the Suez
Canal and with it the Red Sea. She has
made overtures and supplied arms to
Somalia. Now she has plans which em-
brace friendship with both India and
Pakistan. Russian vessels with Indian
or Pakistani harbors at their disposal
are but a short cruise from Colombo
and Trincomalee. A serious threat to
the whole of the Indian Ocean looms.
Meantime Red China, not to be out-
done, gets to the heart of the matter
by entrenching herself in Zanzibar
the “zan” of Tanzania a position
calculated to dominate Mombasa and
Dar es Salaam. We can now look for a
Russian leapfrog from Mogadishu to,
most probably, Madagascar, with its
colossal natural harborage for war ves-
sels. The line of fire brings South Africa
into the picture.
South African supply and repair bases
in the event of the developments pic-
tured would, in friendly co-operation
or alliance with us, have an inestimably
high value in countering any threat to
Western Australia from the Indian
Ocean. Equally, they secure our sea-
borne commerce line to Europe. In the
Indian Ocean, in fact, we face a two-
fold covert danger in which, in friendly
concert with us, South Africa is prob-
ably the key to our survival.

Joke bloke
I would like to correct a statement in
Denis O’Brien’s article “What Makes
Australians Laugh?” (8., May 4). He
states: “Strains of the joke blokes still
survive in such random examples as
Joliff’s (his spelling) cartoons in the
‘Australasian Post’.” I wish to say I
have never drawn for the “Australasian
Post.” My characters Saltbush Bill and
Witchetty’s Tribe have appeared ex-
clusively in “Pix” magazine for the
past 22 years. Incidentally, The Bulletin
can take the credit or blame for
publishing my first outback cartoons
back 34 years ago.

Kangaroo slaughter
“This does not mean that unlicensed
shooting (of kangaroos) does not take
place” seems too mild a comment from
N.S.W. Warden Ranger Rogers (8.,
May 11) when figures given in Federal
Parliament last week by Mr. Cox,.
MHR, seem to imply that, any time
now, this animal will survive only in
zoos and small wildlife sanctuaries. No
animal could survive a constant kill rate
of up to 10 million a year.

British books
The comment in “One More Week”
on British publishers (8., April 27)
over-simplifies the situation. It is true
that 'many American textbooks have
been adopted for first-year university
courses in Australia. British books
hitherto have not been very suitable
for this particular audience because the
first-year course as it is known in Aus-
tralia has not so far existed in Britain.
But in all other areas of tertiary educa-
tion British books are widely and in-
creasingly used. Now many new uni-
versities have been set up in Britain and
these are using something like the
first-year course which is common in
Australia. British publishers have, there-
fore, for the first time, a direct stimulus
to produce books for these courses and
this is one reason why British publishers
have sent a mission to Australia.
