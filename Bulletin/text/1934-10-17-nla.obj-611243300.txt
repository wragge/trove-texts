The Week’s Best: —
THAT DISTURBING
CHARACTER,
GENIUS
A world that
seems pleased
enough to accept
literary utterance
for its statement,
regardless of its
voice, ought to be well satisfied with the
translating of Jacob Wassermann’s novel
The Goose-man. It was probably done,
as most things are nowadays, with a
machine.
The novel’s theme is an examination
of the character of genius, as shaped and
revealed by conflict with the conven-
tional, or, as it is called, the normal, run
of mankind. It is a representation widely
removed from that given in all such
pretty things as Esther Meynell’s “Grave
Fairytale” and “Quintet,” or the musical
delicacy “Lilac Time,” through which
genius wanders metamorphosed into
something between a moonstruck water-
lily and a gigolo. Wassermann sees the
character in question as a tremendously
mortal thing; a driven, hag-ridden being;
a walking fire of soul fastened to a body
as traitorous as it is superfluous: the
natural pariah of conventional society.
The conflict
which he stirs
about this (musi-
cal) genius has
nothing ori g i-
nal to it. Genius
of much more
genial nature than
his Daniel has
been percussion
to precisely the
same sort of con-
fl ic t whenever
and wherever it
has appeared
among a conven-
ti o n - flattened
people. There is
no point in shirk-
ing the plain
truth about it: it
is a kind of char-
Brian Pentan.
acter which does outrage. The mere
physical appearance of it is usually quite
enough. That poet’s eye in a fine frenzy
rolling is wholly comfortable to contem-
plate only when it is dead and the organs
are drooling it to a cathedral crypt or the
brass band which Lawson, being deaf,
asked for is blaring it out to Rookwood.
Alive, it represents something which must
be put down, banned and prosecuted, as
in that silly police seizure of the “Art in
Australia” issue of Norman Lindsay’s
drawings, and the Customs House ban-
ning of such of his books as are published
overseas, a fate that might have attended
even such a book as “Landtakers” if it
had been first published abrOgd, and
might even have happened to it here if
the mostly self-appointed representatives
of conventional propriety were quite as
audacious as they are foolish.
AUSTRALIAN
NOVELISTS
MIGHT COPY?
A more impor-
tant aspect of
W a s s e r manh’s
novel, having our
own attempts in
mind, is the num-
ber and the individual excellence of his
minor figures. Daniel—called the Goose-
man after a statue of a man with a
goose under each arm: a fine figure for
genius! —-is set up in a symbolical and very
well depicted provincial German com-
munity, not unmusical, but conventional
in its music as in its morality. It serves
well enough to provide the necessary
surround of opposites and complements
whose reactions illuminate the drama of
Daniel’s bewildered life. On these Was-
sermann—in common, of course, with
all first-rate novelists—lavishes an in-
terest and a passionate attention to de-
tails that has hardly anything like a
counterpart in the work of even the best
of our own earnest but fearfully hasty
writers.
It is largely for what it does on this
plane that “Landtakers” is so important
a contribution to literature in Australia.
Penton was clearly interested in the pro-
jection of his minor figures, and as clearly
gave more than ordinary care to avoiding
monotony of resemblance among them.
There is evidence of the same interest
in Henry Handel Richardson, whose
Cuffy is as fine almost as her Mrs.
Mahony; but even in such good ones
there is hardly the sensation of dramatic
effectiveness given by these buzzing, mali-
cious or puzzled satellites of the Goose-
man —the conviction that almost any
one of them could have been a major
figure in an Australian novel. This is,
of course, not a heedless disparagement
of Australian writing, but a comparison
made possible and even inevitable by the
very fact that our writing is beginning
to look strong enough to stand it.
Of Wassermann’s numerous minors,
the eccentrics are exceptionally well
represented: figures that stir, among other
sensations, an admiration for their
maker’s fertile ingenuity, the best of them
Phillipine, the novel’s evil genius, an
exciting figure of malignancy. The other
women, most of them sacrifices in
Daniel’s hag-driven progress, are also
finely done, though the author does use
them most blatantly as means to an end
—in general, to display the futility of at-
tempting to share the burdens and blows
of the driving hag; and, in particular, in
the* mad Phillipine’s destroying of
Daniel’s whole-lifetime compositions, to
point the ultimate Inevitable bitter futility
of genius Itself, a spectacular climax to
Ihe drama or an ironic gesture, as the
reader prefers to have it.
The novel suffers constructionally
from a rather clayey mid-part, and it
closes with the author dabbling in a
juvenile sort of wool-gathering ; but it is
a satisfying, in many places an impres-
sive, piece of fiction.
A JEW IN
SEARCH OF
SALVATION
Wassermann,
Again, in Sal-
vation, by Scho-
lem Asch, the
translating is no-
thing to sing
about, unless per-
haps a dirge for
what had been a
labor of love and
has become a
labor. It is, however, a fresher-looking
job than the other.
Whether the novel was written before
or after the vast “Three Cities,” of last
year’s translating, is not stated, but
either it was written first or it
was a recreational piece following that
colossal accomplishment. This other is
comparatively slighter fiction—-inciden-
tally, so much like some other fictional
treatment of Continental Jewry that one
reader with a passable memory suffered
a sense of having read it before. The
fact, possibly, is that this inspired young
Jew, who deviates from direct allegiance
to the Rabbinical theocracy and be-
comes unofficial Rabbi to the rabble, is
a legend of those outlandish places of
Europe where the Race seems to re-
semble more the Outcasts than the
Chosen of God.
Like Wassermann, Asch casts his scene
back 100 or so years, but, as Wasser-
mann also does, he invests it with such
an air of present actuality that it bears
little relationship to what is ordinarily
designated historical fiction. Certainly,
in some aspects, the novel is as remote
as antiquity: its people’s theology is
plain Old Testament, and their state of
existence —despised, harried, , fearful —
would seem, but
for the recent his-
tory of Germany,
to belong to an
age of barbarity.
But similar re-
moteness could
conceivably per-
vade a realistic
novel set in
Bour k e ; and
neither it nor the
author’s deliber-
ate 1 y repetitive
mention of dates
suggests that he is
writing of any
but things he has
personally wit-
nessed and ex-
Scholem Ascii.
perienced. It might well be a com-
mentary on Jewry in Europe at the
present day, not so much concerned with
“Christian” persecution as with Jewry’s
internal religious state of being.
The novel opens with a light, almost
a graceful, even a humorous depicting of
that briefest of all human springtimes,
the childhood of a Jewish boy in such
insular European Jewish communities as
this one on the banks of the Vistula: a
little book in itself, so finely and beauti-
fully done that a busy enough book-
taster could read it twice, and passed re-
luctantly even then to the other two parts
of the narrative.
The business in these is the searching
to his spiritual core of the figure thus
lightly given into the reader’s affection.
Forced by circumstance to adopt a
more lowly path than that of the Rab-
binical theocracy which attracts and en-
gulfs his father and brother, his simple
integrity captures the following of the
rabble. Set up by them as an unofficial
Rabbi, he becomes centre to a legend of
miracle-working, lacks the strength to
deny it or get out of its tangle, and suf-
fers temptation by it, and self-scourging
and reproach before finding the way,
pointed by his own faith, to reconcilia-
tion and salvation. Whereupon he dies,
happily enough.
The writer does not wholly overcome
his own temptations. He overdramatises
the piety of this central figure, and he
falls into melodrama in his search for
spectacular effects. Nevertheless, the
novel leaves a clean impression of fresh-
ness and simplicity, in strange contrast
with that heavy opulence that hangs
about his “Three Cities’! and about so
much of the great Jewish contribution
to contemporary literature, probably the
most outstanding group work of the
present times.

From Sponging
to Robbery
Authors who
received that cir-
cular of the Aus-
tralian Literature
Society men-
tioned by “F.S.”
(R.P. 10/10/’34) must have been deeply
impressed. As an example of printing
the document is an object-lesson to
printers, as a fount of domestic informa-
tion it sets a desirable precedent for pros-
pectus writers, and as a piece of redoubt-
able hide it merits adoption by the De-
fence Department.
The society, as stated in the benevo-
lent publicity given to it by “F. 5.,” pro-
poses to hold in Melbourne next month
an exhibition of books by Australian
writers. There is nothing dubious about
that intention. The society’s circular-
appeal to authors, however, embodies
also this memorable passage:
We hope that after the exhibition you
will allow your books to remain as a
donation for the library of our society,
but if you desire them to be returned to
you we will do so provided you send the
necessary postage.
Well, imagine—and if this is not appo-
site I should like to be told why it is not
—imagine another sort of society hitting
on a like scheme for holding out a help-
ing, not to say a grasping, hand to Aus-
tralian etchers and addressing to them a
circular couched in similar terms. The
most probable outcome would be that
every etcher would try to illustrate the
thing and sell it as a joke. The sugges-
tion, in fact, is plainly ridiculous, and it
is so simply because it is utterly un-
thinkable.
Against that, it is doubtful if there is
a single writer in the country sufficiently
independent or assertive of ordinary
rights to tell this Australian Literature
Society that, if it wants a library with his
books in it, it should buy those books,
or, alternatively, go to the devil.
Still, in this attempt to provide a
library for itself at the expense of Aus-
tralian authors, the society can at least
plead the warrant of first-class example,
that of the Governments of the country.
These do not stoop to appeals to
authors: they simply rob them out of
hand. In order to fill out the shelves
of the various public and Parliamentary
libraries they compel every author to
forego the profits on sundry copies of
every book he has published in Aus-
tralia. The more expensive the work is,
the more, of course, is he mulcted of.
These various Governmental institu-
tions must have their copies of his work
free, and it is even made obligatory on
his publishers to be accessories in this
plain act of robbing him, as no Govern-
ment would dare even attempt to rob
an etcher (copies of every etching haven’t
to be sent to the art g alleries \ or a
danana .g ro wer, black-pudding maker or
any other producer in the community.
The writer, being servile and dependent
enougd t 0 stand it, an d worthless as vote-
dait, can be confidently relied upon to
put up with tb j s shameless robbery, or
wdb anything else that is considered bad
enough for him.
It is about time all these peo ple realised
j bak an au thor has to live, and that he is
a producer deserving enough of his coun-
Governments to buy their
cop j es G f his books, and for literature
soc [ edes to refrain from sponging upon
however desirable to all concerned
the formation of libraries may be.

RONALD MCCUAIG.
Pornography ,
or What
Have You?
I am interested
in C. H. Rolles-
lon’s roar (R.P.
19/9/’34)on three
counts. Firstly, he
says he was
brought up among the men and
women who were the active ele-
ments of the Irish Literary Renais-
sance. Secondly, he says they left
a legacy of Irish loveliness. Thirdly, he
asserts that the modern Irish writers have
perverted that legacy, besmirched it with
filth, and one at least has gone out of
his way to paint it over with the lowest
and most degraded colors.
Now, if Mr. Rolleston was brought
up among the giants, real and imagined,
of that renaissance, he learnt very little
from them, because they were not, or
the best of them were not, concerned
with leaving a legacy of Irish loveliness,
or Irish ugliness either, but with depict-
ing the life around them with the greatest
degree of truth that was in them.
Landscapes are apt to contain dung-
hills as well as other objects more con-
ventionally associated with ideas of
beauty, and the Irish Renaissance was
only a renaissance because the active ele-
ments in Ireland put the dunghills in
along with all the other objects. Scores
of Irish writers before them had left the
dunghills out, with the result that they
missed making the renaissance.
For some reason or other, the adoles-
cent Mr. Rolleston didn’t notice that,
far from the Irish people and most of
the Irish critics perceiving that it was a
renaissance of Irish purity and beauty,
they thought it a very filthy and disgust-
ing libel on their country. They said
precisely what Mr. Rolleston says about
the modern Irish writer —that those
writers treated their subjects obscenely
and held a distorting mirror up to the
fair faces of their fellow-countrymen.
Synge’s “Playboy of the Western
World” caused exactly the same thrill
of horror as Mr. Rolleston now gets
from contemplating “The Puritan” of
Liam O’Flaherty; and I think it was
over the former play that Mr. Rolleston’s
contemporaries nearly pulled the Abbey
Theatre down about the ears of the
actors who tried to perform it. Nearly the
same thing happened at the Playhouse,
Melbourne, only a few years ago.
George Moore, who is another of Mr.
Rolleston’s active elements, was little better
treated! His trilogy of reminiscence,
“Ave,” “Salve” and “Vale,” was regarded
as revolting ; and even more so was his
account of how he gave a literature to
Texas, which was printed in the “English
Review” later. It was regarded as an in-
sult, not only to Erin and the Irish, but
to readers who believed that this earth
still contained some beauty and purity
and that Ireland had her fair share of
it; and this is precisely the opinion
Mr. Rolleston now has about Liam
O’Flaherty.
Of course, it may be that the modern
Irish writers are really filthy and dis-
gusting and deliberately pornographic,
and that Mr. Rolleston is more discern-
ing to-day than the people who said the
same thing about the gods of his renais-
sance ; but I refrain from giving him my
verdict until he defines such words as
“loveliness,” “purity,” “beauty,” “deli-
cacy” and so forth. These words are
available equally to artists and confec-
tioners.

More on the
Literary
Snobocracy
Cecil Mann’s
article on literary
societies (R.P.
26/9/’34) g o t
right down to the
guts of what is
the Old Man of the Sea riding the Aus-
tralian writer. He asks, in effect, what
have writers to do with these la-di-da
yops who live on literature, not by litera-
ture, and the answer is nix. Further to
his views is here the opinion of one who
for long has been attempting to earn a
crust with a pen.
Proof of right to be heard: In boun-
dary-riders’ camel carts, in station kit-
chens after long days at work over a
red-hot stove, - in stockmen’s huts and
even on tucker boxes under the stars I
managed to produce six novels con-
sidered good enough for publication by
a first-class London publishing firm, and
good enough for such literary journals
as the “Times Literary Supplement,” the
London “Bookman” and the New York
“Bookman” to note favorably. The
novels were planned and written and
polished without thought of fortune
or social advancement. They were pro-
duced by the aid of hurricane-lamps
and slush-lights blown out by windstorms
and blotted out by flying insects ; pro-
duced when my body was frozen in
winter and tormented by mosquitoes and
heat in summer. There was no one to
advise, and the opportunity did not exist
to curry favor with a publisher’s repre-
sentative. My work stood absolutely on
what merit it possessed. I accomplished
something without being related to a
Judge, a M.P. or a family constantly in
the social limelight.
From this experience it seems to me
that the whole substance of the matter
is this: A writer has two paths from
which he must choose. If he wants to
earn a living with his pen he will have
no evenings to spare for literary meetings.
If he desires tinsel fame he must buy a
boiled shirt and a bottle of hair oil, and
join all the literary societies.
I have no objection to these societies
as such. The members may drink beer
or strychnine, whichever they prefer.
The study of literature is ever mentally
elevating, which should be the prime rea-
son for the formation of any literary
society. If they embrace other objects—
the boosting of mediocre work, self-
boosting and relation-boosting ; permit-
ting men and women to set themselves up
as masters of literature and masters of
the art of criticism ; and directing public
attention to work the merit of which has
failed to drawn any attention but their
own —it is time that some working writer
should tell them to go somewhere and
take a running jump at themselves.

A Satchel of Books
If a better boys’ book than Comman-
der H. C. Brewster’s Pearls of Papua is
offered this year it will be an uncom-
mon good one. The book, illustrated by
G. K. Townshend and finely turned out
by Endeavour Press (55.), is a stirring
story of three chaps who successfully
hunt pearls in North Australian waters
until a hurricane wrecks their boat;
then, escaped on a raft, they land un-
armed on Papuan shores, stagger through
miles of mangrove swamp, find them-

selves, through the good services of the
parrot Pinkoi, adopted by natives, and,
pushing on, encounter the bow-and-
arrow pigmy cave-dwellers of inner
Papua, and fight with these oddities
and others before embarking on a dark-
nights-only voyaging by canoe down one
of the longer rivers. The tale is simply
but breathlessly told, with a ring of truth
to it. This Page recommends it with-
out qualification as a manly, healthy,
certain-to-satisfy book for boys, and one
capable of casting a spell also over any
normal adventure-loving adult.
Mississippi Jimmy, by Clem Yore
(Bodley Head ; 7s. 6d.). Wherein young
Jimmy Gay pursues through violent ex-
citements the vendetta inspired by the
killing of his dad by the Riders of
Death. An uncommonly well-told Wild-
Wester.
They Called Him Death, by David
Hume (Collins ; 7s. 6d.), may live up to
the jacket pronouncement, “If Hume
can’t thrill you no one can,” but as the
copy forwarded for review has pages
missing here and there, these columns
suspend judgment. Of course, it might
be a new idea for making these darned
things more mysterious.
Methuen and Co. are engaged in in-
viting distinguished Englishmen of all
castes, professions and political affilia-
tions to contribute to a symposium, If
/ Were Dictator. Lord Dunsany’s version
to hand (Booklover’s, Melb.; 3s. 9d.) is,
like his stories, fantastic, capricious,
somewhat romantic and at the same time
often highly suggestive and touched with
a whimsical humor. Dictator Dunsany
is deeply concerned with his subjects’
teeth, their habit of throwing away the
best part of their wheat and devouring
the rubbish, to the detriment of their
digestions, and the contempt compositors
display towards the ideas on punctuation
of authors. Statues to living politicians
are to be erected at the public expense,
but with the proviso that there shall be
engraved on them some quotations from
the model’s speeches, to be chosen by his
opponents ; a verbal incinerator will be
established for the cremation of words
which are habitually abused, such
as “imperial pint,” which deludes the
drinker into imagining that he is getting
more beer than from an unadjectival
pint, whereas the reverse is the case ,
and so forth. Dunsany’s dictatorship
does not pretend to be comprehensive,
but the comprehensive ones, like Plato’s
Republic, have just as many holes in
them as the incomprehensible ones.

WILL THERE BE WAR?
1 he death of Alexander of Yugoslavia
was in keeping with Serbian tradition.
Nearly every Serbian prince and king
since Black George raised the banner of
revolt against the Turks in 1804 has
either abdicated or been murdered.
The greatest sight in bleak Belgrade,
where the funeral bells are always toll-
ing and the dull thunder of the rolling
Danube permeates the streets, is the win-
dow in the palace from which the naked
bodies of King Alexander and Queen
Draga were flung in 1903. All day
groups of tourists stand outside the
palace, which looks like the Queensland
Club, while guides point out the spot
marked “X,” and sheepskinned guards,
with bayonets a yard long, stand stolidly
at attention at the gates. That Alexander
was an Obrenovitch. The Alexander shot
last week was a Karageorgevitch. It is
traditional for the crowned head of one
family to be “removed” by the other and
for the head of that to pick up the crown.
The only departure from tradition in
the latest* murder was that it was per-
formed by a Croat on foreign soil, and
that it involved as well an elder states-
man of France who has been the chief
mentor of Yugoslavia for years.
Everything is French in Belgrade—it is
hard to tell the local money from French
currency. French is spoken everywhere.
The army is French-drilled. Every
major political crisis since the war has
been preceded by a visit to Paris.
The Croats have no reason to love the
French or the Serbians, but for that
matter they have never had reason to
love any of their rulers. Pinched in an
area between the two great tributaries
of the Danube and the Adriatic, they
were liberated when “the ramshackle
empire” went to pieces. Liberation runs
as regularly in Croatian history as assas-
sination does in the rival royal families.
Ever since the Czechs drove them out
of the Carpathians 1300 years ago some-
body has freed them of their bonds every
few generations, afterwards claiming the
wages of friendship and trying to im-
pose another language on them.
Apart from the disturbances caused by
these continual changes, the natural
conditions in which the Croats live
tend to make them a bad-tempered
people. The rivers are wide and
gloomy and in winter they freeze. The
country is so cold that the lean pigs
which they drive over ice-covered tracks
in the oak-groves to dig acorns grow
wool on their backs. Most of the illiter-
ate village inhabitants are indigent and
landless. In the towns there are factories
which yield huge profits to the rich —
among them members of the royal family
and military leaders—but the employees
work a 100-hour-week for a shilling a
day. Influenza takes a regular toll.
Rarely does one pass a village without
black flags. The bargain sale of coffins
—with prices marked down as a draper
marks down stockings—is a normal sight
towards the spring, when mortality falls
off.
Discontent has befen accentuated dur-
ing the past decade by one outstanding
cause. Emigration used to be a staple
industry in Yugoslavia. Thousands went
to the U.S.A. and sent back annually
anything from £6,000,000 to £10,000,000
in Uncle Sam’s dollars. It kept the
Croats and the Slovenes on their feet.
Since depression struck the world, the
exiles have been coming back, inured to
American conditions but without dollars.
They become the inevitable prey to the
Green Peasant International and the
Communists, who sometimes form 75
p.c. of the village populations and help
to prepare the rest for the next liberation.
During the first few years after pillaged
Serbia became the largest Balkan nation
and ceased to look across the Danube to
foreign Austrian soil, which for centuries
had been saluting its frowning forts with
cannonshot, the Croats and Slovenes had
a rough time. Apart from their other
troubles, their resources were carried off
to develop the purely Serbian industries
of the south. This was not achieved
without incident, but the Skupshtina—
the local Parliament —and King Alex-
ander both had a way with them. Free-
dom of the press was interdicted. Liberty
of speech was confined to the Best
People.
The murder of Stephen Radich, a
revered Croat leader, on the floor of Par-
liament brought crisis. The King went
to Paris, and on his return declared a
dictatorship. Politics became almost a
civil war. Last July the vice-president
of the Croat Peasant party was mur-
dered. The quarterly of the Royal In-
stitute of Foreign Affairs says:
The glaring resemblance in this case to
the procedure at the murder of Professor
Sufllay and the unsuccessful attempt on Dr.
Budak has convinced public opinion that
terrorism is the deliberate policy of the
regime.
When the victim had been buried be-
side Radich, his colleague, Dr. Trum-
bich, remarked: “1 shall have the same
end. Murder is an old practice of the
Serbs.” The Terrorist wing of Croats
didn’t waste words. They planted a
bomb in a Government desk, sent an
infernal machine to a Judge, drove the
King out of his summer residence in
South Croatia and polished off a Minister
or two and some traitors. The Marseilles
assassination came in natural sequence.
France will not lightly pardon the
murder of Barthou, author of the con-
scription law of 1913. The Yugoslav
Government will exact all the punish-
ment it dares to exact from Croats in
general. The Croats may rebel, and if
they do Italy may be involved, since
the port of Croatia is Fiume, Italian
territory since 1924. Bulgaria, too,
will be uneasy. But there are now no
military empires to quarrel over a royal
corpse and to drag democracies into their
quarrel. Germany and Austria have
been reduced to impotence in the Bal-
kans ; Russia may intrigue but can-
not fight; France and Italy have learned
that war is a mad game in which the
winner loses. If the assassin’s bullet
starts another, which seems unlikely,
Australia will not be in it.
A BIG-CITY GOVERNMENT.
Australia expects the U.A.P. and the
C.P. to do their duty by becoming
jointly responsible for its government
while the times remain critical, and the
rank and file of both parties are will-
ing ; but the negotiations for an agree-
ment failed. Not because policies and
objectives are irreconcilable —if, indeed,
they differ at all—but because cordiality
was lacking on the part of the leaders.
It was a case of
I do not like you, J.A.L.;
The reason why 1 needn't tell.
And of
I do not like you, Dr. Page;
Your presence puts me in a rage.
Each distinguished statesman gets on the
other’s nerves.
The Prime Minister entered upon the
negotiations very reluctantly. Melbourne
“Age” says they were “forced on
him by strong outside influences, after
he had announced his intention of form-
ing his Ministry from within his own
party.” The C.P. leader asked for a
Tariff Board inquiry—
To ascertain the items in the schedule
protecting industries which add unduly to
the cost of others, and which produce
insignificant quantities and absorb little
labor, so that concessions may be avail-
able for trade treaties with customer
countries.
This would have committed the Govern-
ment to nothing, and if, after many
months, the Tariff Board reported that
there were land industries in this, cate-
gory the Agrarians would have dropped
the subject like a hot coal. Mr. Lyons
proposes, in any case, to negotiate “trade
treaties with customer countries.” But
the inquiry he would not have.
The C.P. asked for Cabinet represen-
tation in proportion to its numbers in
the House. It has 15 Ms.H.R. ; the
U.A.P. claims 32, but is by no means
sure of two of the Liberal and Country
Leaguers from South Australia. The
Prime Minister would not go beyond
“three portfolios, one of which may be
Vice-President of the Executive Council.”
He likewise refused to let Dr. Page rank
as “deputy-leader of the Government,”
though the man was that in Mr. Bruce’s
time, and though, in the terms of the
proposed agreement (“the leader of the
U.A.P.,” be he Mr. Lyons, Mr. Menzies
or anyone else, “to be P.M.”), he could
never be Prime Minister. Dr. Page was
to come in fourth behind Mr. Pearce, a
subordinate member of the Bruce-Page
Ministry, and Mr. Menzies, who has
never been in a Commonwealth Cabinet.
This was ungenerous; and acceptance
would have been humiliating. Fellow-
Agrarian Bruxner figures in N.S.W.
“Hansard” as “Deputy Premier and
Minister of Transport.”
So Mr. Lyons is to carry on, if he can,
without the majority which the electors
refused him. Mr. Latham, Mr. Perkins
and, of course, the defeated Mr. Guy
are out of the Government; Mr. Men-
zies, Mr. E. J. Harrison and Mr. Hughes
(as Vice-President of the Executive
Council) are in it. Mr. Gullett returns
as “Minister without portfolio directing
negotiations for trade treaties.” Senator
Brennan replaces Senator Lawson. Sena-
tor McLachlan moves from External
Affairs to the P.M.G.’s Department.
And, though half the U.A.P. members
are returned soldiers, Mr. Parkhill, who
has never been exposed to any explosive
missile more dangerous than a cracker,
becomes Minister of Defence. Mr. Marr
remains in the Ministry, but at the end of
the Prince’s tour he is to be thanked and
dismissed with a knighthood.
Five members of the Government
come from Sydney, five from Melbourne
(six really, though one sits for Geelong)
and one each from Adelaide, Ipswich
and Devonport. Mr. Pearce is assigned
to Perth, but he rarely shows his face
there, and at election-time —to the delight
of his latest party—he made himself
scarce. There are four lawyers in the
Ministry and four professional politi-
cians, but no woolgrower, no wheat-
grower—nobody who can speak for the
Australia that lies beyond a bit of the
coastal fringe. Country interests are
totally unrepresented.
This queer Big-City Government will
not last. But this does not mean
that another general election will be
necessary when it falls or fades away.
There is no reason worth a rush why
the U.A.P. and the Country party should
not come together under a leader con-
genial to both. It won’t be Mr. Lyons,
and it won’t be Dr. Page, but those
gentlemen do not exhaust the possibili-
ties, though they may exhaust the
people’s patience. There are other
gentlemen.
MILLIONS DON’T MATTER.
In his Budget speech Premier Stevens
reported that N.S.W. Government rail-
way operations for the year to June 30
had resulted in a loss of £2,632,570. On
his own showing it Was really £BOO,OOO
more, for “Government contributions
towards losses on developmental lines”
are included in “earnings,” and they
amount to £BOO,OOO a year. There is also
an annual “reimbursement of loss of
revenue in connection with the coal-
settlement agreement” ; it amounted last
year to £45,277, the Auditor-General
notes. Mr. Stevens went on to say that
operations for the current year—again
with the “contributions” and the “reim-
bursement” reckoned as revenue—were
expected to show a loss of £1,534,770.
On the same day the Premier was
asked by a supporter whether it was
true, as asserted in the Labor press,
that there had been “considerable in-
creases in the salaries of some of the
higher officials in the Railway Depart-
ment.” He replied that the pay of
railwaymen receiving up to £750 p.a.
was “regulated by the Court.”
With regard to those earning higher
salaries, the question is within the jurisdic-
tion of the Commissioner. The Govern-
ment, as a Government, has nothing to do
with the regulation of pay.
But when pay is “regulated” at the ex-
pense of the taxpayers the Government
ought to have something to say about it.
It is the taxpayers who have to meet
the enormous losses on these Govern-
ment railways, so when fat hogs are
greased they foot at least part of the
bill.
Subsequent to the Premier’s disavowal
of responsibility, the Minister of Trans-
port read to the House a circular in
which the Commissioner admitted that
“certain heads of branches” had “had
their salaries brought up to the salaries
paid to their predecessors during the
previous seven years.” The gentleman’s
own salary had already been raised to
the boom-time level, less the financial-
emergency cut. A singularly ill-timed
gift, considering that the railways were
then running away with practically
£3,500,000 p.a., and that, with relief tax
deducted, drivers of mail and express
trains have been reduced to £4 13s. 6d. a
week, while guards are getting £4 and
£3 17s. 6d. and signalmen as little
as £3 Bs. Id. ; but at least the thing
was done openly, and the people can call
the Government to account. Over the
non-elected Commissioner they have “no
jurisdiction” when he in effect gives
away their money.
By way of justifying the rises to the
“certain heads of branches” it is stated
that “their duties were greatly increased
by the reorganisation effected in January,
1933, when the present Commissioner
took office.” It seems that the Commis-
sioner’s personal staff was increased also.
For 1933 the average number of per-
sons employed in the offices of the Com-
missioner and the Secretary was 144,
compared with 115 in 1932, whereas the
number of permanent-way men declined
from 7600 in 1932 to 7352 in 1933.
Somehow it recalls Admiral Scott’s signai
to his squadron when he was ordered to
suspend all firing practice and get ready
for a water-picnic: “Paint-work seems
more important than gunnery ; so come
in and make yourselves look pretty.”
The Stevens Government is fond of
referring to the progress made in every
direction since 1931-32, the year in which
N.S.W. Labor went off its head, as if
that were a fair standard. Victoria has
had no Lang, so the Argyle Government
lacks that excuse for making tedious and
misleading comparisons. Ft produced
its Government railway report for 1933-
34 two or three weeks before Premier
Stevens hailed the “reduction” of his
railway deficit to £3,432,500 as a brilliant
achievement, and went into no trans-
ports about it. On the contrary, it
obviously regarded the financial result
as a serious matter for the State, and
newspaper comments on it were in the
same strain. Yet the debit balance was
small compared with the thing for which
the accountant Premier awards such
credit to the accountant Commissioner:
£735,100, reckoning in Government con-
tributions as earnings, and £1,229,900
without them. And “revenue for the year
was the lowest since 1919,” while reduc-
tion of interest and exchange consequent
on the loan conversions (from which
Victoria has so far benefited little)
amounted to only £90,600, as against
£516,400 in N. S. Wales. Moreover, the
Victorian system derived no advantage
from the State Transport Regulation Act
—its Transport Board did not assume
office till May, and has made no
appreciable changes even yet.
N. S. Wales has had the blessings of
transport regulation since 1931. To
force passenger and goods traffic on the
railways every device that can be
thought of is resorted to, short of knock-
ing people on the head. Almost every
day paragraphs like these appear in sober
newspapers like the “Morning Herald” :
The activities of Government transport
officials on the Western-road are in con- •
stant evidence in this locality, which is just
over the 50-mile limit. By day and night
lorries and cars are stopped and permits
and contents are inspected. This in what
we once fancied was a free country.
At Casino a man named Jordan was pro-
ceeded against for carrying three persons to
Grafton races. The police said he had not
been paid by the passengers. Fined £2.
Replying to a question asked in Parlia-
ment, the Minister said that junior
cricketers were forbidden to travel to the
grounds in motor-lorries when other means
of transport were available.
So much for these methods of extorting
business, though volumes could be
written. And the present railway man-
agement has been favored in other ways
which the Government that praises it
so fulsomely does not mention. Com-
pared with 1931-32 its wages and salaries
bill was down £804,660 in 1932-33 as a
result of Commonwealth arbitration
awards and the State Public Service
Salaries Act. In 1930-31, when employees
under Federal awards had their working
week reduced from 48 hours to 44, the
cost was reckoned at £165,000 p.a.; these
men are back on 48 ' hours. The de-
partment pays no taxes, though its com-
petitors are skinned alive, and it is appa-
rently ceasing to pay rates —at all events,
the item “municipal and shire rates,”
which figured in the books at £97,800 in
1929-30, got down to £5600 in 1932-33.
And so far from putting down £1,000,000
a year for depreciation, which a private
concern with a capital of £141,000,000
would certainly be expected to do, it
mentions the word only in connection
with its refreshment-rooms branch, and
then debits that luckless enterprise (losses
for two years, £32,100) with a mere
£B3B. It is even getting interest-free loans
from the Government “to cover abnor-
mal expenditure on tracks and rolling-
stock” —£800,000 this year, £1,250,000
next year and £1,250,000 in 1936-37.
Mr. Lang has been a wonderful asset
to the U.A.P., but it has traded on him
long enough. The people of 'N. S. Wales
have shown that they can take care of
the gentleman, and they are tired of
being told that they ought to be humbly
grateful because things are not so dread-
ful as when Langism was at its worst,
and about to burst. They are sick of
seeing an exploded demagogue trotted
out as a bogey to excuse inaction and
justify insolence. Nor will they go on
submitting to deprivations and imperti-
nences in the name of transport regula-
tion when the financial results are so
ghastly, though good enough for a Gov-
ernment which oozes self-satisfaction
and unctuous rectitude.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Wool Situation.
It is unsatisfactory, to say the least.
Figures issued by the National Council
of Woolbrokers show that from July 1
to September 20 279,789 bales of greasy
were sold at auction for £3,600,000,
£l2 16s. 2d. a bale. The sales in-
cluded 119,789 bales of last year’s wool,
held over through postponements. For
the same period last year, 354,817 bales
were sold for £6,327,420.
This September there was no wool
Derby of half a dozen ships crammed to
the hatches. Total shipments for the
quarter were only 4325 bales; Sydney
shipped 984. In Sydney, according to
Goldsbrough Mort,
Value of turnover, as compared with the
same period of last season, shows a de-
crease of 88,934 bales and £2,337,101 in
value. Total wool sold to date is 132,611
bales; value, £1,695,066.
This included private sales.
Though the public has been told re-
peatedly that the market is getting
stronger, the average September price
for greasy was 8.79 d. per pound, or
£ll 16s. 4d. per bale; the average for
the July-September quarter was 9.13 d.
per pound, or £l2 16s. 2d. Too big a
margin for quality alone to account for it.
Turnover this season originally was
estimated at 3,146,000' bales (scoured
included), of which five-sixths have
yet to pass through the auction-room.
The N.C.W.S.B. aimed at' offering
1,549,000 bales before Christmas. Bris-
bane was budgeted to offer 100,000 bales
at its first two sales. The official return
shows 2518 bales sold to the end of
September ; this does not include carry-
over wool. Victoria, S.A., W.A. and Tas-
mania were put down to get rid of
675,000 bales before the end of the year ;
so far they have sold 52,011 bales of
this season’s cut designed for auction, and
carry-over sales are unlikely to double
the figure ; private sales won’t increase
it much either —in Sydney they are about
one-twelfth of the auction total.
Auction sales to end of the September
quarter represented about a seventh of the
turnover last year; less than a tenth of
the estimate this year. A lot of wool
is being held back or passed in because
there is a feeling that “things must im-
prove,” that “there will be a big rise
for certain in December”; but there
is no supporting evidence. London
prices, though demand has strengthened,
were lower at the last sale than on the
closing date of the previous series. There
has been a slight improvement in October
at Melbourne and Brisbane; the wool
at Brisbane was freer from vegetable
and dust than at the September dis-
posals.
Unless there is a welter of buying from
now onwards Australia is likely to have
a smaller wool cheque this year than in
any depression year, except perhaps
1930-31. But no Government seems to
be worrying, though all our Governments
are concerned, in various ways, and
there is no representative of our greatest
industry in the new Lyons Government.
«
Garden, M.H.R.(?).
In a few days Mr. J. S. Garden will
arrive at Canberra as member for Cook
(N.S.W.). A defeated Communist candi-
date for Sydney in 1925, he will appear
in the House as a follower of Mr. Lang,
who once attacked him as a “Moscow
delegate and an apostle of piebald Aus-
tralia.” If permitted he will “swear” or
“solemnly affirm” that he will be faith-
ful and bear true allegiance to his
Majesty King George, his heirs and suc-
cessors according to law—the King of
whom a paper “published by J. S.
Garden” wrote:
The King of England differs from the
Czar, who was a cold-blooded criminal,
in that he is entirely useless as a ruler. He
is a superfluity, an ornament, a mouth-
piece, a mere decoration... .He has fallen
as low as it is possible for a king to fall.
To fall lower would be to cease to be a
king and become a jester.
An original member of the House of
Representatives was expelled for an at-
tack on “this bloody and accursed Em-
pire,” And Hugh Mahon was never a
Communist, as Mr. Garden was; had
never boasted that “Revolution” had
“stepped on the stage in Australia,” never
gloried in being a member of the execu-
tive committee of the Communist Inter-
national. For one wild utterance Hugh
Mahon, thrice a Minister and a father
of Diggers, was sent back to his con-
stituents, and they rejected him. How
can the House suffer, without challenge
and adequate guarantees, the presence
of a person who, on the face of it,
bound himself to “observe the strictest
discipline and most complete devotion to
the Communist International”?
The Constitution of the Common-
wealth is very clear on these questions:
44. —Any person who (1) is under any

Melbourne’s Tramway Trouble.
Melbourne is learning what communi-
ties let themselves in for when they set
up transport monopolies. The Gov-
ernment Railway Department and the
Melbourne Tramway Board have
frowned on competition, and on the eve
of the centenary celebrations and the
visit of the Duke of Gloucester the
board found its organised employees,
among whom a Red element has been
active, dictating to it. In this ex-
tremity the Government turned to those
who are usually regarded as the Tram-
way Board’s natural enemies for help
and said it would mobilise all private
transport facilities if the need arose.
The Tramway Employees’ Association
last month asked that its members should
be paid time and a quarter during the
royal visit and the centenary celebra-
tions, ‘‘plus Is. margin.” The board
replied with an assurance that the men
would share in the extra profits earned
during the rush period ; would, in fact,
be generously treated for any special ser-
vice rendered with goodwill and effi-
ciency.
A meeting held on Sunday, Oct. 7,
attended by about a fifth of the members,
decided that wages must go up 2s. a day
all round, and stay up, and that working
shifts must not exceed eight hours. The
board announced that this would in-
volve a 10 p.c. increase in the staff and
an addition of £164,000 p.a. to the wages
bill. Demands refused.
The union executive thereupon made
plans for a “stopwork meeting.” It was
arranged that no employees should report
for duty on Oct. 16, thus leaving Mel-
bourne tramless.
The tram-men are walking right into
an open shaft. They have grievances
which ought to be examined. Their com-
plaint about shifts being juggled to evade
award payments certainly calls for refu-
tation or amendment. But throwing Mel-
bourne’s traffic into chaos at a time of
national celebration is insensate folly.
No strike ever succeeds which hits the
general public.

Sampans and Sense.
“Dungeness”: The persistent presence
of Japanese working vessels in the
waters of the Great Barrier Reef and
Torres Strait has created a situation
which will need all the commonsense of
which the Commonwealth Government
is possessed.
Premier Forgan Smith has been legally
advised that there is no doubt as to
Queensland’s ownership of the islands
along the Barrier Reef. Admitting this,
admitting Australia’s rights and the rights
of each State concerned to every island
and islet from Lady Elliott clear round
to the Dampier Archipelago, it does not
affect the present question in the least
degree.
The popular view of the Great Barrier
Reef is a sort of breakwater dotted with
picturesque islands, running close along
the N.Q. coastline. In actual fact, it is
a vast collection of coral cays, separated
by deep channels and submerged under
heavy surf from half-tide to half-tide.
One may sail through its waters for
weeks without .sighting land, for months
without coming within three miles of an
island.
On the usual northward steamer
track, the traveller sights no part of the
true Barrier mass until he has voyaged
for 600 miles within it and has reached
Hinchinbrook Island, north of Towns-
ville. Then he sees to seaward —only
from half-tide to half-tide —Bramble
Reef. Eastward of Mackay the Queens-
land sea boundary is 160 miles off,
across Swain’s Reef; at the Whitsunday
Passage more than 75 miles; at Towns-
ville over 30 miles. The nearest point to
the coast is 12 miles off Cape Melville.
In 20,000 and more square miles of Bar-
rier waters, rich in marine products,
there is not sufficient dry land to justify,
under the three-mile limit, a claim to
even a twentieth of it.
So there is nothing to prevent Japan-
ese or anyone else from bringing a
10,000-ton mother ship, or half a dozen
such, to any amongst a hundred anchor-
ages which are safe for nine months of
the year, and from operating from each
of them 50 or more working power-
boats. There is- nothing to prevent such
vessels from replenishing supplies and
gear from overseas vessels of their own
or other nationality—except, of course,
Australian. Nor is there the slightest
justification for any Government, State
or Commonwealth, to demand from
them a penny for customs duties, light
dues, harbor dues, license fees, excise,
income tax or otherwise, or to interfere
with them in any way so long as they
keep beyond the three-mile limit from
mainland or islands.
It is obviously unjust and unreasonable
in such circumstances to continue the
heavy imposts under which Australian
operators suffer at the hands of State
and Commonwealth alike. If these Aus-
tralian waters are to be exploited in
wholesale fashion, as appears to be the
case, Australians should be helped and
encouraged to secure a generous share of
the treasures which Nature has laid upon
their own doorstep. As matters stand,
they are the only people in the world
who are being taxed and hampered for
attempting it.

The Diggers and “The Bulletin.”
Dear Bulletin, —Following considera-
tion of the 1933-34 annual report of this
organisation, annual State Congress, just
concluded, resolved unanimously to place
on record its appreciation of the ser-
vices rendered by Bulletin Newspapers,
Ltd., in various ways during the 12
months under review.
I have much pleasure in conveying the
text of this resolution, and would add
that I personally and those associated
with me on the staff at this branch head-
quarters desire to record our special
thanks for the great assistance given us
by you on many occasions.—Yours faith-
fully, R. L. Hadfield, State (N.S.W.)
secretary, R.S.S.I.L.A.

Efficiency in the Customs.
The efficiency of our Customs Depart-
ment is unquestioned. Periodical sales
of seized goods augment the Common-
wealth revenue to a considerable extent,
and the zeal with which officers pounce
upon banned books is a thing to be ad-
mired.
It is true that every city possesses a
few people whose appearance bears wit-
ness to the fact that illicit drugs get into
the country somehow, but this is not the
fault of the Customs. Goodness knows
its officials search the luggage of return-
ing tourists and visiting stage celebrities
conscientiously enough! That the stuff
gets in is due entirely to the fact that
the smugglers don’t allow the officials
to see it. If they did it would imme-
diately be seized.
But the department’s strongest point
is in the realm of schedules, lists and in-
ventories. Give a Customs man an in-
ventory and he will be happy for hours.
Make it out in duplicate and you’ll keep
two officials happy.
The latest example of efficiency is
afforded by their treatment of Titania’s
Palace. This wonderful monument of
patient industry combined with art has
been exhibited by Sir Nevile Wilkinson
throughout the world, and negligent Cus-
toms officers in other countries, whilst
showing personal interest in the work,
have not troubled themselves officially
about it.
Not so our men.
As soon as the Palace reached Sydney
a demand was made for an inventory of
all the many thousand tiny parts that go
to make up the magnificent work. Pro-
tests that there was no such list in exist-
ence went for nothing. One had to be
compiled.
It is only natural to suppose that after
a lifetime of collecting Sir Nevile will
be on the lookout for buyers for the
Tutankhamen horse in Oberon’s study, or
the Benvenuto Cellini figures in the
Throne Room. The inventory will ensure
that in such a contingency the depart-
ment will lose no revenue, unless of
course it occurs to Sir Nevile to substi-
tute for the items sold cheap copies from
a junk shop.
And in any case, think what a won-
derful time the officers will have in
checking the list at the end of the tour!
«
A One-man Veto.
Questioned in Parliament about his de-
partment’s rejection of the plans for the
£250,000 theatre proposed to be built
in Sydney in opposition to the Stuart
Doyle “quasi-monopoly,” N.S.W. Chief
Secretary Chaffey seems to have lost
his temper. Anyway, he let fly at the per-
sons who aim at challenging the “quasi-
monopoly” (the expression of the Royal
Commissioner appointed by Mr.
Chaffey’s Government); “men animated
by the spirit of money-making,” he called
them. This is a poor imitation of Mr.
Lang in his most hysterical mood —not
that Mr. Lang would resort to it in this
case, for the building-trade unions are
all protesting against the veto on the
plans.
C. Bruce Dellit, the architect, states
the position as he sees it':
Mr. Lee, M.L.A., requested the Chief Secre-
tary to take my plans to the House for perusal
by members. The Minister refused.
These plans were rejected by his department
on grounds of “public safety.” The Minister
said that if he approved “life would be en-
dangered,” that “people would be caught like
rats in a trap,” and so on. The plans have
been the subject of opinions by three lead-
ing architectural and building authorities, Pro-
fessors Wilkinson and Hook and A. H. Martin,
who unanimously agree that they amply secure
public safety. Obviously, in view of these
widely differing judgments, there is a definite
necessity for further discussion, and the
Minister, instead of preventing this, should
welcome it.
In the administration of the Theatres and
Public Halls Act, 1908, under which the plans
were rejected, the Minister is assisted by an
architect attached to his department and a
representative of the Board of Fire Commis-
sioners. It is the duty of the architect to
peruse all plans submitted and to report to
the Minister, who makes the decision.
From the Minister’s ruling there is no appeal.
The departmental architect is, technically, the
sole arbiter. The Minister, not being a
technical man, must necessarily be guided by
his architect’s advice or take the responsibility
of ignoring it and permitting work to proceed.
Surely there should be a body of technical
experts to whom reference may be made should
the architect or owner submitting a proposal
feel that he is being harshly treated.

“Recommended to Mercy.”
From the reporters’ table:
The Boles case (B. 3/10/’34) was rare in one
respect. It was murder with an eyewitness,
and a revoltingly brutal murder at that. Yet
the jury virtually forbade the exaction of the
death penalty.
As a newspaperman I have “done” every
murder story in Victoria for nearly 20 years,
and to my mind Governments have made the
rod for their own backs. They have rigidly
refused to consider the abolition of the death
penalty, so juries have become a law unto
themselves and declared against capital punish-
ment.
Owing to the general tendency to shirk jury
service, every section of the community with a
bit of “pull” has pressed for exemption, until
juries in Victoria are almost exclusively drawn
from the artisan class. Ninety per cent, of
them belong to the political party which places
the abolition of capital punishment on its
fighting platform. Such jurymen enter the box
with conscientious objections to the death
penalty, and these find expression either in one
of the absurd manslaughter verdicts which
have been a feature of Victorian murder trials
since the Angus Murray execution or in a
recommendation to mercy that the Executive
dares not ignore. If it did we would have re-
peated a series of incomprehensible acquittals
on murder charges, such as followed the last
imposition of the death penalty for murder.
There are other sidelights on the working
of trial by jury in Victoria which may explain
many inconsistent verdicts. Since the depres-
sion came to dwell with us there has been bred
a sullen hostility to the police in industrial
districts. This is due to the use of the uni-
formed constable for the seizure of their poor
goods and chattels for unsatisfied debt.
Even worse, the uniformed police are used
for evictions. All this breeds in the class from
which our juries are recruited an animus
against the police and the law they represent,
which finds its outlet in “spite” verdicts.
Another explanation of many “not guilty”
decisions is the hostility of the public to
police methods in obtaining “statements” from
suspects. Though there are vehement official
denials of third degree on American lines, the
public knows that suspects are taken to police
headquarters and questioned for hours by re-
lays of detectives, without any charge being
laid against them. Juries reject “confessions”
extorted from prisoners at the end of such
gruellings.
Mend the system we must, for we cannot
end it. Exemptions from jury service should
be drastically revised with a view to restoring
its ancient status of trial by one’s peers and
extending the onus of this public duty to all
classes of the community. Accused persons
should be freed' from illegal detention and
cross-examination without legal assistance.
Most important of all, the police should not
be used to collect bad debts for moneylenders
and landlords.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Shrewsbury”: I note that
Eton is among the English G.P.Ss.
to which a frozen lamb is to be
forwarded from these parts, and
I can’t help wondering who will
eat it. When Henry VI. founded
the school he arranged that 24
poor scholars should have free
lodging, clothing and teaching
there. The clothing included a
gown which the “Collegers” (as
opposed to the Oppidans) still
wear. The King also provided
12 sheep a week to feed the Col-
legers. It was inevitable as time
went on that the Oppidans should
begin to look down upon the Col-
legers. They referred to them as
“Tugs,” from their supposed
habit of tugging at tough mutton,
and “Tugs” they remain to this day.

"Kingsley T.”: A nomadic person,
appearing before a Brisbane beak on the
charge of having stolen a train ride,
waxed almost indignant when he was
told it was no use entering Queensland to
look for work. “I didn’t come to look
for work,” he said. “I came because I
like the climate.”

“Rouge Dragon”: Another world-
famous dynasty came to an end when
the “Empress” Nichoperu-Commenu-
Palaelogu died the other day at 74. The
lady traced her pedigree back to Con-
stantine and those who ruled the By-
zantine Empire after him until the Seljuk
Turks brought it down in ruins. Queen
Victoria, who had a deal of respect for
claims like these, suffered one of the few
rebuffs of her life when the descendant
of royalty, invited to Court in London,
refused to go unless received with the
full honors due to a reigning Empress.
As this rather cut into Queen Vic.’s cake,
the Byzantine lady was given a miss.
* * * *
“One Eye”: I feel grateful to Field-
Marshal Milne, who explained to an
Australian audience the other day that
his habit of wearing a monocle was not
swank but due to the fact that, like
hundreds of other men, he has one nor-
mal eye and the other off the centre, so
to speak. In his day the wearing of
spectacles meant a plough for Sandhurst,
so his crammer told him to wear a
monocle in his bad eye. The examining
quack took no notice of what he thought
a bit of youthful flashness, so Milne
passed without trouble. I am like
the F.-M. in that, while my left eye is
normal, the right is not. Hence I have
to wear double spectacles with one eye
covered by a bit of useless window-pane
glass and the other by an expensive
pebble. If I were to take my courage in
both hands and wear a monocle every
braying ass of my acquaintance would
make life a misery for me.

“Tailspin”: The first aeroplane con-
structed and flown in Australia (B.
3/10/’34) was Capt. John R. Duigan’s
machine, built and flown by him in 1910.
Duigan was a native of Mia Mia (Vic.).
His craft was a pusher biplane, built on
the lines of Farman’s machine, fitted
with a Melbourne-made engine and
dressed in cotton-and-rubber fabric. It
weighed 1401 b. The machine, intact
except for fabric, is now preserved in the
Melbourne Technological Museum. Dui-
gan went to England, served with the
Australian Flying Corps in the war and
won the M.C.
“Hamer”: Bill Hart, who is still able
to practise dentistry in Sydney, was
risking his neck in air flights four years
before that W.A. ’plane was flown in
1914. When he took off from Parramatta
“Macphairson’s a fule, lass! Tuk ma tae a Jacobites’ gatherin’, as he ca’d it.
they were nae Jacobites—they were a’ R-r-rechabites!”
(where the machine had been made in
his backyard) for Windsor, he had a
brother with him. The flying itself was
not so bad, but Hart admits that he closed
his eyes when landing. He opened them
to realise thankfully that he was safe on
earth, and then remarked that after a cup
of coffee they could fly back again. The
brother said he was going back by train,
whatever Bill liked to do ; even to-day
he will not go into the air. Bill himself,
although he was in the Air Force in Pales-
tine, is not altogether at home in the
modern ’plane.
“Ike Hollar”: The refusal of Port
Kembla (N.S.W.) bricklayers to work on
Sunday, despite an award of Industrial
Judge Cantor, recalls a suburban incident.
Blogkins, a municipal employee, directed
to do some toil on the Lord’s Day,
objected and was sacked. The dismissal
of a man for sticking to his religious
principles became a leading local ques-
tion. The parson proclaimed from the
pulpit that it was men like Blogkins who
made the British Empire what it is, and
added that he was proud to have Blog-
kins’s children in his Sunday school. A
sympathetic bookmaker headed the sub-
scriptions which led to Blogkins being
handed a substantial cheque, whilst pres-
sure of public opinion caused his rein-
statement in a better job than his old
one. Blogkins, however, was dropped
suddenly by the chief enthusiasts after
the parson made an appeal for a special
appearance at church of the sturdy ad-
herent to principle. “Nothing doin’,”
said Blogkins. “Not on Sunday. I
always go fishing on Sunday.”

“S.T.S.”: S.A. has been doing a bit
of excavation on Egyptian lines. John
Ridley, inventor of the harvest reaper,
was a miller, and his engine, which
ground the first bag of flour that the
infant province produced, was given a
place of honor in the Jubilee Exhibition
of 1887 ; after which it utterly vanished.
When it was wanted for the approach-
ing centenary, the memories of veterans
were drawn upon. Finally, it turned out
that the historic piece of machinery had
been used in building up the mounds on
the Jubilee Oval below the old building.
It took five days to locate and exhume it.

“Marton”: Even the “Age” has been
forced to the conviction that Melbourne’s
“Cook’s Cottage” is far from being what
it was first represented: that the navigator
never lived there and that the evidence he
ever set foot in it is of the slenderest. The
facts, it decides, were not fully known
when the cottage was bought for removal
to Victoria, which “shows the need for
adequate investigation before historic
relics are purchased, however laudable
the impulse.” It does. But when the
“Age” claims credit for squelching “the
deplorable error of judgment and lapse
of taste which sought to have the cottage
erected on the grounds of the Public
Library,” I am not quite sure that I
follow it. If the alleged historic relic
i 3 a good deal of a fraud, what does
it matter where it is (or isn’t) erected?
Cynical persons may suggest that the
Yarra-bank, where so many fairy-tales
are spun, would be the ideal site.
“C.Q.”: The only evidence to suggest
that Cook ever spent a night at the cot-
tage to be re-erected in Fitzroy Gardens
boils down to a letter written by
him on Jan. 30, 1772, and superscribed
“Grand Ayton.” He might have stayed
in his father’s dwelling for the week-end,
but he might just as easily have put up
at a friend’s or at an inn, for the
tiny cottage has about as much
accommodation for guests as a movie
sound cabin. None of these things really
matters, however. The cottage is a charm-
ing example of eighteenth-century archi-
tecture, and will be an ornament to the
Gardens. Even if it is definitely proved
that the discoverer of Victoria never set
foot inside it, it will go down in history
as “Cook’s Cottage,” just as the Pro-
clamation Tree at Glenelg will go down
as the tree under which South Australia
was christened, although my great-grand-
mother tried to spoil the sport by point-
ing out, 25 years after the first ceremony,
that the original tree had been chopped
up for firewood many years previously.

“Chuck”: Prince Henry, one learns,
was safeguarded against all untoward
happenings at Fremantle and Perth by
the unobtrusive presence among the
cheering crowds of a score or so of de-
tectives “selected for their ability to
wear morning and evening dress.”
“Ability” seems a Strange and somewhat
invidious term. Many people don’t wear
ceremonial attire with easy grace or as
if they were used to it, but apparently
’tecs thus camouflaged must do so or
else they will be suspected of being ’tecs.
The old idea that such officers of the
law belong to a distinct and easily recog-
nisable type dies hard. “You don’t look
like a sheep-herder,” says one of O.
Henry’s detectives to that engaging
character “Black Bill.” “But you look
like what you are to me,” returns the
other. American sleuths, 1 gather from
the talkies and other sources, generally
wear derbies or black bowler hats. But
in Australia I doubt if the popular con-
ception of a detective is any more accu-
rate than that picture of a bookmaker
with which black-and-white artists always
insist on presenting us.

“Electrical Engineer”: If “General
Prac.” (B. 19/9/’34) gets in the road of
a lightning discharge, his executors will
have a practice to dispose of, no matter
whether he has been kiln-dryed or soak-
ing for the previous 24 hours. The wet-
ness of a human body is not a con-
tributing factor to susceptibility to light-
ning. A charge is built up on a cloud,
and this induces a charge of opposite
sign— i.e., if the first charge is negative,
the induced charge is positive—-on an-
other cloud or on the earth. If the
latter, a concentration of charge will
take place on a prominent feature of
the earth beneath the cloud, such as a
tree, hilltop, power-transmission line,
house or whatnot. If the charge is suf-
ficiently great, the insulation of the air
between these points breaks down
and a discharge of lightning takes place.
Keeping in mind all the chances, I am
rather surprised when a man is so un-
lucky as to be struck, especially as fully
90 p.c. of strokes take place from cloud
to cloud. “General Prac.’s” theory fits
in better with the days when mirrors and
reflecting surfaces were carefully cov-
ered up when lightning was about and
when it was deemed dangerous to carry
metal objects during a thunderstorm.

“R.W.8.Y.”: Unless my memory has

“D.E.”: It is asserted, though it seems
hardly credible, that Mrs. Fowler, aged
59, accused of making away with a
gentleman friend, aged 79, at Barry
(N.S.W.), is the first woman ever to be
charged at Bathurst with murder. I
don’t know how long criminal sessions
have been held at Bathurst, but it was
proclaimed a town in 1852, and became
entitled to call itself “The City of the
Plains” in 1885. The most notorious
murder case of the century in which a
woman figured in the dock was that of
Martha Rendall at Perth in 1907. She
[looked after several children for her
paramour, and was accused of having
tried to poison the lot with spirits of
salts. One died, and she was convicted
and sentenced to death. Before the
charge was laid the agricultural editor
of my old rag, pressed into service as
an interviewer, called to see her, and
came back wCh the report that she was
a soft-spoken, matronly person who
loved children (“as nice a woman as I
ever met, sir!”), and that the C.I.D. had
blundered. The night before execution-
day the consciences of many State poli-
ticians smote them. They drew up a
petition to Nanson, the Attorney-General,
a long, cold person, who had been a
pressman. Rightly or wrongly, it was
said that he read the petition impassively,
tore it into a dozen pieces and tossed
them into a waste-paper basket, saying
grimly, “Rubbish—this woman shall
hang!” Anyway, she did hang.
BACK TO THE ARMY AGAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. W. M. Hughes has accepted office in the'
Lyons Ministry.”
I’m back, in a tricky collar and a tony
billycock hat,
It’s ten long years since they threw me out on
my ear, but what of that?
Though long a prophet unheeded, a leader with
none to lead,
You can’t keep a good man always down,
comrades, you can’t indeed.
Back into harness again, Joseph,
And keen as ever of brain;
Though scarce as spry as in days gone by,
Back into office again.
I'm seventy, true, but you know who’s who and
what’s what, too, my son;
Lloyd George’s turn may come next perhaps—
he is but seventy-one.
“I can’t come back,” Jim Jeffries groaned when
he took his quantum stiff.;
But that doesn’t go with chaps like us—we
Taffies are sterner stuff.
Back near the throne again, Joseph,
Where once it was mine to reign.
Pearce, you old twist, give us your fist,
We’re cobbers and mates again.
They gave me the dirty chuck-out; they
bumped me out of the ship;
But I bided my time, being never the sort
that rushes the kip.
1 founded another party, but the darned thing
wouldn’t gee;
And they’ve taken me back to their hearts once
more, the good old U.A.P.
Back to the tart-shop again, Joseph,
And the reason, I’ll say, is plain,
For the road looks rough and the old dog’s
tough.
Back to the spotlight again.
I’m here when my country calls me, though
my old-time Digger hat
Has gone long since to the discard —there’s no
more use for that;
I’m here because it’s conceded, when it comes
to running the show,
I’ve fairly forgotten more than the whole of
the rest of you know.
Back to the old caboose, Joseph,
Back to my true domain;
Thirty years erst since I entered it first,
Back to the Army again.

“Selma”: The discussion about belief
in the existence of hell as a preventive of
perjury reminds me of an incident in a
Maoriland court. A 10-year-old youth
was produced as an important witness in
a domestic upheaval. When asked his
views on truth-telling the prospective wit-
ness stared stolidly at the Bench. “I sup-
pose you know what happens to little
boys who tell lies,” remarked the Judge
helpfully. The youth regarded him with
a suggestion of contempt. “Nothink’s
never happened to me,” he rejoined with
the air of one speaking out of a long ex-
perience. Turned down as a witness on
the ground that he was “incapable of
understanding the nature of an oath.”

“Fierce Light”: The stickybeak pub-
licity stuff perpetually featured in English
newspapers about all the intimate doings

But it looks as if it is to be carried to
even worse lengths here. The ladies

“Mudurup”: Perth “Sunday Times,”
placed under option to the “West Aus-
tralian” proprietary, has had only two
quartpot bosses, of curiously different
types; one Cornish, the other Scotch.
F. C. B. Vosper, an uncommonly able
writer and speaker, set it going in 1897.
Vosper, who once wrote a “Prospec-
tor’s Handbook,” might have found a
real goldmine in his newspaper had
he lived, but he died at 32, just as
he was starting his campaign for the first
Federal Senate and looked likely to top
the poll. McSmith, of the Kalgoorlie
“Sun,” and a partner, quick to realise
the possibilities of Sunday newspaperdom,
secured the property for a song from
Vosper’s widow. The emotional Tommy
Walker was the first editor under the new
regime. He had six successors, all of
whom are still alive, before McSmith
decided to take over the job himself a
few months ago. The now-extinct Kal-
goorlie “Sun,” run for many years in
conjunction with the “Sunday Times,
saw three of its editors get into Parlia-
ment —Hugh Mahon, Wallace Nelson and
Tommy Walker. McSmith was hoisted
into the Westralian Assembly on the
shoulders of the “S.T.” 20 years ago, and
has stayed there ever since.

“Cayenne”: 1 can supply a mate for
“Findy’s” fruitologist (B. 3/10/’34). Our
signwriter’s shop is adorned with a
rough picture showing a back view of
the artist at his work. The word “sign-
ologist” appears underneath.

“Spook”: Not only pagans and
Malays safeguard their temples and im-
portant buildings by burying human
beings under the foundations (B.
3/10/’34). There is plenty of evidence
that many of the early Christian churches
were reared on a similar foundation.
The great Minster of St. Mary’s at York,
which dates back to Anglo-Saxon times
and still retains some scraps of carving
and moulding of that period, is sup-
posed to be one. It was essential in these
cases that the victim should be a virgin.
No powers of evil could approach a
building over which the wraith of a
young person of unblemished character
kept everlasting vigil.

“Maurice Mix”: One of the many
difficulties which beset old-time station
managers in the back country was the
classification of his visitors, a point which
decided whether they came to the house
or went to the hut. Clothes and means
of conveyance meant nothing; Tyson
was no dandy, and travelled with a pack-
horse. I never made a mistake, though I
had some close shaves, and I was guided
by a simple rule. If a stranger, after get-
ting off his horse or jumping out of his
buggy, came forward in an open manner
and introduced himself, an invitation to
the house followed. Cards of introduc-
tion were no good —they only meant
commercial travellers or insurance
agents. We gave them a feed, though
not a drink. And the fellow who
shuffled about and never gave a direct
answer or asked a direct question, who
never looked a bloke in the eyes or
faced him, was told to get rations at the
store and camp on the creek.
“Bruton”: Poet Laureate Masefield,
one of the centenary guests, expressed
on landing in Westralia a keen interest
in Dampier’s Archipelago, which prob-
ably few Westralians know except on the
map. The interest, one gathers, was
partly provoked by the thought that if
Dampier had hit any more promising
part of Australia than the Nor’-west
colonisation of the continent might have
begun nearly 100 years before it did. It
almost certainly would have, too, if Dam-
pier had been as optimistic as Cook. For-
tunately or not, he wasn’t. On his first
voyage to New Holland in 1688 he found
its shores repellent and the people “the
miserablest in the world,” lower than
Hottentots. After his second voyage
in 1700, when British Admiralty officials
were already discussing the possibilities
of a settlement in New Holland to off-
set Dutch influence further north, Dam-
pier repeated his earlier impressions, and
“W-w-w-what’s your name?”
tersely stigmatised the natives as “much
the same blinking creatures.” His report
settled any chance of the colonisation
of Australia being started on the west-
ern side. Some have blamed him for
pessimism, but, after all, his views
were identical with those of earlier
Dutch navigators—Pelsart not only pro-
nounced the natives “obnoxious and un-
friendly” but the land “barren and
accursed.” Dampier, of course, was far
from being a great navigator like Cook,
but as a close, accurate and unwearying
observer of all that came under his rov-
ing eyes he was a long way ahead of
any seaman of his time.
“Tom Willie”: A
new Enoch Arden,
even more philoso-
phical than the ori-
ginal, turned up the
other day in a
southern Queensland
town. He had gone
away, as a man will
sometimes, and re-
mained away for
years ; his wife had
taken another mate.
Husband No. 2 an-
swered a knock at
the door and got the
shock of his life
when No. 1 asked if
his missus still lived
there. Recovering
himself, No. 2 ad-
mitted it. His ex-
planation that the
lady and himself
had been assured
that the visitor had
died in Charters
Towers was accepted
in an entirely friend-
ly spirit. And
Enoch, professing
reluctance to disturb matrimonial feli-
city, went on his way again.
* * * *
“L’F.”: I disagree with the contention
that women will drop athletics once it
is established that they promote hairiness
(B. 3/10/’34). Woman has been regu-
larly told since first she went in for
tennis, cycling, golf and swimming that
any of these activities would ruin her
complexion and figure. None the less,
girls did all these things in increasing
numbers without appreciably diminishing
the density of their admirers. I suggest
that the whiskered fraus at the world
contests would have needed razors just
as much had they never engaged in any-
thing more strenuous than domestic
duies. As long ago as the ’nineties papers
like the “Young Ladies’ Journal” were
sprinkled with advertisements for specifics
for making girls less hairy and figures
more womanly,
* * * *
“A.J.S.”: “Sealed Pattern,” in draw-
ing attention to a slip concerning busbies
and bearskins (B. 16/9/’34), is himself
not meticulously accurate. He states
that busbies are worn by the R.A., but
it is only the Royal Horse Artillery
branch of H.M.’s Royal Regiment of
Artillery that is so adorned. The three
remaining sections, R.A., R.F.A. and
R.G.A., wear the ordinary helmet. Pos-
sibly even the R.H.A. busby is now
doomed, since the Horse Gunners are to
become “mechanised units.” In that case
one of the world’s most inspiring spec-
tacles —a Horse Artillery battery at the
gallop—will become only a memory.
* * * *
“H.M.”: “The Movement” in its Lang
days runs singularly short of ideas, as
evidenced by the chief banner displayed
at Sydney’s Six Hours Procession. The
old Eight Hours agitators coined a very
good slogan ; the Six Hours successors
could think of nothing better than to
collar and mutilate it. The banner pro-
claimed the principle of “Six Hours’
Work, Six Hours’ Sleep, Six Hours’ Rec-
reation.” What was to be done with the
other six hours wasn’t stated.

“Pardon Me”: There is a good deal
more in the Sherlock Holmes cult than
has met the eye of “Say 99” (B.
3/10/’34). An American doctor made
a pilgrimage from St. Louis and suc-
ceeded in identifying the house in Baker-
street in which Holmes lived—in spite of
the fact that Conan Doyle was hardly
ever in that thoroughfare. There is also
a French publication entitled Vie amour-
euse du Medecin Watson. In Spain both
Holmes and Raffles have been seen on
the stage together. Another interesting
item for Sherlock Holmes addicts is that
Holmes and Watson started life in the
author’s manuscripts as Sheringford
Holmes and Osmond Sacker respectively.
This shows the importance of names to
writers of fiction. It is hard to imagine
a Vie amoureuse d’Osmond Sacker.
* * * *
“J.C.” sends a line from Peru:
This question of the Cornish bonfires (B.
9 and 16/5 /’34) is interesting, for a similar
festival is observed here in Huancayo, Peru,
and on June 24, too. Questions as to the origin
of the feast elicit nothing more than “Because
it is customary,” and the present-day priesthood
knows little or nothing of the origin. From the
identity of dates in the two hemispheres it
seems probable that we can trace a Christian
influence. But why the festival should be on
St. John’s Eve in both Northern and Southern
Hemispheres is not so easy to explain. In this
locality actually it marks the end of the har-
vest and the beginning of the threshing, but
it can hardly be said to conform to any
season in the Andean altiplano, where, accord-
ing to the railway brochures, it is perpetual
spring.
ODE TO A MERINO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The design for the Hacarthur centenary stamp,
to be issued next month, represents a merino ram,
with a background of plains gierging into the
distant mountains.”
Finest of all our fauna, also smartest,
You hit the eye more pleasingly, old chap,
Than that huge ’roo which some forgotten
artist
Sprawled so untidily about the map.
What though your forebears came across the
ocean
From storied Spain or Saxony afar.
There’s nobody can cavil at the notion
We made you what you are.
I looks towards you —and to you, Macarthur;
Rightly your memory the land reveres,
Seeing you peered into the future farther
Than any other of our pioneers.
You builded well, determined, stern, unbending;
Your record isn’t one to lightly die
(Albeit I hold it quite beyond defending,
The way you treated Bligh).
Horned monarch of the plains and proud
begetter
Of numerous remunerative flocks,
’Tis time we stuck your picture on a letter
And dropped it gently in a pillar box.
A better ad., I’ll say, you’ll guarantee us,
A fairer emblem prove across the sea
Than either the Macropus or Dronneits
Novce Hollandicv.
Merino king, what worthier regalia
Than you for coat-of-arms or crest or
plaque?
For many a rolling year you bore Australia
To opulence upon your massive back.
And, though the outlook mayn’t be quite
the brightest,
I utterly refuse to entertain
The least uncertainty, the very slightest
Doubt that you will again.
N.S.W.
MIDFORD.

POLITICAL POINTS
The defeat of Byrne, Carroll and Mc-
Donald for the Senate is a nasty knock
for Queensland Labor, which regarded
them as certainties. They were 16,651
votes behind the U.A.P.-C.P. three when
the primaries had been counted; but
they expected to get nearly all the 41,654
votes distributed among the other six
candidates —three Douglasites, two Ind.
Labs, and a Communist. As it hap-
pened there was a lot of cross-voting,
which noticeably favored Cooper, the
Digger ; so Crawford and Foil go back
and Cooper will accompany them in
seven months or so.
On House of Reps, voting Queens-
land Labor ought to have won the three
Senate seats with ease, but its central
executive disgusted many “comrades” by
picking the ticket itself. Now they are
saying “Serves you right for not taking
a ballot!”
Labor got the bulk of the Douglas
Credit preferences nearly everywhere
In Fremantle, however, they reduced the
Labor man’s majority of primaries over
the U.A.P. candidate from 2500 to 1000.
The U.A.P. candidate was a lady. This
supports the impression that Douglasites
are mostly young and impressionable.
Excluding loan operations, the N.S.W.
Government had a debit balance of
£2,022,500 for the September quarter.
Revenue was down £434,070, and expen-
diture up £90,630; in the jargon of
Australian Treasurers there was a “re-
gression” of £524,700. But the public
is assured that it needn’t worry; Mr.
Stevens will see to everything.
The Alsatian-dog question will bring
down an Australian Government yet. A
clause in the N.SrW. Pastures Protection
Bill providing for the sterilisation of
Alsatians kept in sheep country led to
the bitterest debate of the session and
to the defeat of the Government on a
non-party vote, 13 Ministerialists cross-
ing the floor. Much was said of the
cruelty of the proposed proceeding ; but
it is really more cruel to keep the hounds
cooped up in Sydney and Newcastle,
which the bill permits.
What’s the matter with all those coun-
try U.A.P. members of whom Lyons so
lately bragged that they were more repre-
sentative of inland Australia than Page’s
“Of course, a fellow can change his
mind when he’s got to.”
lot? He hasn’t put one in his Ministry.
If the Ministry is not a makeshift he
must (1) think meanly of them, or (2)
mistrust their loyalty. Seemingly it is
iust makeshift and make-believe.
There are two Eric Harrisons in the
U.A.P., and both were soldiers; it is
the younger Eric who has become a
Cabineteer. When he went after the
nomination for Wentworth (N.S.W.) in
1931 his supporters urged against his
opponent, Arthur Manning, who had
been Whip to Bruce-Page, that a wheat-
grower couldn’t understand and deal with
the problems of Bondi. Now, as repre-"
sentative of a district in which the larg-
est farms are those of the Knoxes and
Fairfaxes at Bellevue Hill, Eric the
younger has been appointed Minister for
the Interior.
Both Eric Harrisons served in the 1918
campaign on the Western Front as artil-
lerymen. The Eric not elevated was a
soldier for 27 years before he got in for
Design for a uniform for the new
Minister of Defence.
Bendigo: he was Director of Military
Training in 1914; Director of Military
Art and Commandant at Duntroon;
Commandant in Tasmania ; on the Gen-
eral Staff at the War Office, and Director
of Military Operations and Intelligence
at C.M.F. headquarters. In Parliament
he has made arresting protests against
the neglect of the national defences. So the
Defence portfolio was reserved for Park-
hill, who has directed many general elec-
tions and could be trusted never to falter
if assailed by Mrs. Guppy and Mrs. Clup-
pins of the Ladies’ Irrational League.
Napoleon, when First Consul, used
to keep the members of his Government
working at night. In reply to a remon-
strance he said, “We must give the
people the worth of what they pay us.”
According to Lyons, Latham, now back
at the Vic. Bar, was a bit like that.
At Cabinet meetings Mr. Latham was a
taskmaster. When late at night he was
often willing to go on and on with dis-
cussion of the nation’s affairs, I was often
grateful for the presence of my friend
Pearce, who would tie up his papers and
make ready to depart.
So there is nothing Napoleonic about
George or Joe. No danger of those com-
fortable old pledge-and-caucus boys
working themselves to death!
The unemployed are beginning to
worry the Tas. Labor Government. De-
fending it at Glenorchy, Premier Ogilvie
said that since it came in the weekly
amount paid in “charitable relief” had
increased from £964 to £3OOO. The cry
of the Labor politician used to be: “Men
don’t want charity ; they want work.”
Victoria dropped £1733 on the Gov-
ernment chalet at Buffalo last year. A
poor showing, but not nearly as bad as
Kosciusko makes, despite its liquor
license (Buffalo is “dry”); £36,270 has
gone west at Kosciusko in five
years. All such places should be
leased to the highest bidders. Com-
paratively few taxpayers have oppor-
tunities of staying at them, and it is un-
fair to make the majority pay for the
minority’s pleasure.
Supporting Lyons’s refusal to let Earle
Page rank next to him, “S. M. Herald’
explains that Page is “politically unpopu-
lar,” and that a Lyons-Page Ministry
would have been “politically unpopular”
on that account. Popularity, it seems, is
embodied by Lyons himself, to whom
his own State has sent one supporter in
the House of Reps., having rejected
three, and by Pearce, who is so adored
by Westralians that he didn’t shed the
light of his countenance on them during
the election campaign. Granny is
perfectly serious. The old girl never
jokes.
Brisbane’s Lord Mayor has a new car
It cost £llOO, is “upholstered in royal
blue throughout and is magnificently
sprung.” The carpets are “velvet pile” ;
the seats slide to any angle, and “cigar-
lighters are provided.” Newspapermen
trying the wireless set picked up all local
stations easily, and “the automatic-speak-
ing tube functioned perfectly from the
rear seat.” An illuminated arm directs
following traffic. The car is to carry the
Lud Mayor and party to Melbourne for
the centenary celebrations, 2600 miles
there and back. His Lordship is a
Labor politician.
There is a D. Clyne, formerly a trade-
union organiser, in the N.S.W. Opposi-
tion, and when the name appeared twice
in the list of aspirants to State Labor
nominations it was thought that the
member for King was reverting to a
practice of more spacious days when
politicians stood for two or more seats.
But it transpires that there is another
D. Clyne, a school-teacher, with designs
on Ashburnham. Each was an easy
winner, so there will be two Declines at
the election which Stevens is to hurry
on —naturally, since there were 185,436
votes between the U.A.P.-C.P. and Labor
totals (Dein’s and Dunn’s) at the Senate
election.
Just 13 months ago Captain Fred
Aarons referred scornfully to W. M.
Hughes as out of the limelight and flick-
ering from candlelight to candlelight.
Now the restless old gentleman is a
“You can get to Babylon by candlelight.
And not a bad place either”
Minister again. Attorney-General from
September, 1914, to October, 1915, and
thenceforward Prime Minister till Feb-
ruary, 1923, he hadn’t enjoyed a taste of
office since that date. Yet there is a fly
in Billy’s beer. He is subordinate to
Pearce.
There will be no dearth of aspirants
to the Sandgate seat in Queensland
Assembly when Sizer quits it. Already
five C.P.N. candidates are in the field,
including J. P. Fry, a Digger, who was
M.L.A. for Kurilpa for 14 years. Labor
supporters are not joining in the rush.
Sandgate is safe for the other side.
Prince Henry, it is recorded, slept little
during the night he spent on a Westralian
train. The railway authorities were rest-
less, too; they had men constantly
examining train and track. No doubt
the rattling and swaying disturbed the
passenger’s slumbers, but the carriers
were kept uneasy by memories of a day
“My brother has told me all about the
wonderful train you provided for
him. Wouldn’t it be thrilling if this
were the very one?”
in 1920 when the heir apparent’s coach
and the Premier’s were derailed in a
smash that just missed being tragic. It
was the unluckiest day in the history
of the Westralian railways, which, down
the years, have been remarkably free
from accidents.
Lang’s Badly is greatly concerned
about what he calls “the intrusion of
the Communist party” in the affairs of
the N.S.W. coalminers, which, it seems,
is “having a serious effect on the organi-
sation.” “I am going to sit on no rail,”
Mr. Badly hotly declares ; “it is a party
which works by miserable intrigue and
rotten propaganda.” Come, come, Mr.
Badly! Have you ceased to be a Friend
of Russia?
Having budgeted for a deficit of
£1,100,000, the special Commonwealth
grant of £286,000 being included as
revenue, Premier Forgan Smith solemnly
undertook to reduce taxation. “When?”
all Queensland asked; and Foggy re-
plied, with still greater solemnity, “When
taxation can be reduced, having regard to
the finances of the State.” It is dismally
like the 20-year-old promise that Labor
will support immigration when all unem-
ployed Australians have been “absorbed.”
British Labor has rebuffed its revolu-
tionary socialists by voting 15 to 1
against “uncompensated confiscation
when the State takes over key. industries.”
A member of the party executive ex-
plains that it was to silence the fears of
the workers, “who are sometimes more
concerned about their small investments
than the capitalists are about theirs.”
Very likely, and one reason may be that
the workers are better acquainted with
the politicians who propose to take
charge of their savings.
Having arranged to spend a vast sum
on an unnecessary bridge over the Bris-
bane River, Queensland Labor is con-
sidering a plan to prevent the river wip-
ing parts of Brisbane off the map —as it
has done more than once —by damming
the Stanley River, on the headwaters of
the Brisbane. The scheme is estimated
to cost £2,250,000 at the present value
of money; what the actual cost' will
be nobody knows. But the project is
approved of by people who have no use
for the bridge.

White, 46 ; Casey and Francis, 44 ; E. J.
Harrison, 42 ; Menzies, 40.
Hughes is the only Commonwealth
Minister who couldn’t join the A.N.A.
Menzies, Brennan, White and Gullett
were born in Victoria ; Parkhill, Stewart,
Marr and E. J. Harrison in N. S. Wales;
Francis and Casey in Queensland (Casey
is a native of Brisbane, though he has
spent very little time there) ; Pearce and
McLachlan in South Australia ; Lyons,
of course, in Tasmania.
Dead at 57, Lauchlan Mackinnon, only
son of the Mackinnon who was g.m. of
the “Argus,” and himself one of the
proprietary. Grounded at Uppingham
(Eng.), he put in two years on the
“Scotsman,” and married the g.m.’s
daughter, who survives him. He was a
lieutenant in the Royal Army Service
Corps during the war, after which he took
his father’s place as partner in Wilson
and Mackinnon. A leading Victorian
polo-player in his youth, he owned a
good racehorse in Epilogue. Two of his
three sons are on the “Argus” string of
papers.
Lord BLEDISLOE, Maoriland’s G.-G. —in Melbourne for
the centenary celebrations.
From an old acquaintance:
Known affectionately as “Young Lauchy,”
to distinguish him from his father, “Oid
Lachy” —their names were spelled differently—
Mackinnon grew up with the “Argus” office
but not of it. The old man was a Scotchman
from the Isle of Skye—hard, humorless,
but kindly and just. “Young Lauchy” was
one of the boys—-a rich man’s son in the best
sense. His share in the “Argus” came not
from his father but from his mother, who was
an adopted daughter of Edward Wilson,
founder of the big paper. Wilson left a great
part of the paper’s profits to Melbourne chari-
ties.
As Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Alex-
ander George Wales will commence press-
ing the hands of such centenary visitors
as may arrive after November 9. Until
that date Gengoult Smith will continue
to do the handshaking. The new wearer
of the bunnyskins is a contractor by
trade and has been nine years a city dad.
Twenty-seven councillors sat round the
lighted candle for an hour, according to
the tradition which allowed that time for
a councillor to ride in from outback
places like Heidelberg or Essendon, and
Wales had seven votes to the good.
Vic. Judge Foster, who has declared
hell ultra vires, was, prior to his eleva-
tion to the Bench, one of Melbourne’s
foremost intellectual Radicals. He was
also a tennis-player of the first rank.
When he took his seat on the Bench, he
was given to understand that tennis-
playing in competition games was as
undignified as adherence to minority
political faiths, and he had to push his
racquet, with his political views, into
cold storage.
Adelaide’s Langdon Bonython, who
turned 86 last Monday, is the oldest
knight in Australia, and one of the
oldest in the Empire. He was knighted
36 years ago.
The busy life of William Mclntyre has
ended in Brisbane at 72. Born in N. S.
Wales, he joined the staff of the Mer-
cantile Bank, which was absorbed by
the Commercial of Sydney. From 1915
to 1927 he managed the Brisbane branch
of that bank before retiring and going
into business with a son as a partner.
He was president of the Brisbane Cham-
ber of Commerce in 1930.
Lord Bledisloe,
the retiring Gover-
nor - General of
Maoriland, now in
Australia, is lord
of three manors in
Gloucester and
Verderer of the
picturesque Forest
of Dean, which
lies in one of the
loveliest corners of
England. A bar-
rister, he sat for a
Wiltshire seat in

pire’s greatest
authorities on land
matters, and was
chairman of the
British Royal
Commission
on Land Drainage
and of the Im-
perial Agricultural
Research Confer-
en c e in 1927.
Maoriland will re-
member him for
his gift to the
Dominion of the
old Residency
where the treaty of
Wait a n g i was
signed, and Rugby Union footballers on
both sides of the Tasman tor his dona-
tion of the Bledisloe Cup.
The head of the great Horlick malted-
milk concern, in which Australia has an
interest which is bound to grow, is dead
in Paris at 54. He was the eldest son
of the founder of the business, who was
a baronet; his son Peter —an only son —
becomes the baronet. Sir Peter is now
in Sydney as chairman of Horlick’s Aus-
tralian co. His father had wide sporting
interests, and the son has inherited them ;
at Eton he captained the Rugger team,
shone at Eton’s wall game and was also
president of the Eton Society. He was
trained for Horlicks in America as well
as England. This is his second visit to
Australia.
Sir Nevile Wil-
kinson, at present
in Sydney with
Titania’s Palace, a
miniature marvel
which took him 16
years to complete,
is a descendant of
the Irish giants.
Six - feet - five is
rather tall for a
fairy godfather,
but he has certain-
ly proved one to
crippled and needy
children, for whom
he has collected
over £40,000. As
Ulster King-of
Arms, he is Regis-
trar of the Order
of St. Patrick and
guardian of the
fountain of
heraldry in Ire-
land. He saw ser-
vice with the Cold-
stream Guards in
the Boer War and
again in the Great
War, including the
Gallipoli campaign.
He will have a
birthday on Oct.
26 —his 65th.

15th Battalion, and was badly knocked
on the Somme in 1916. Patched up* he
was taken on the strength of the Aus-
tralian Flying Corps, and was with it
for the rest of the war. He is a C.Q.
sheep-farmer.
Senator Tom Brennan, taken into the
new Lyons Ministry, is one of a remark-
able family from Strathfieldsaye, near
Bendigo. One brother is Frank,
Labor member for Batman ; another is
Billy, political leader-writer for Melb.
“Argus,” who is not nearly, as con-
servative as Tom nor as radical as
Frank. Anna, a sister, is a barrister.
Tom, a proof-reader on the “Argus,”
made his way to the sub-editor’s desk
and stayed there till he qualified as a
barrister. His most notable legal achieve-
ment was his defence of Colin Ross.
While he was in the “Argus” office a
fellow-Minister, Harry Gullett, occupied
an adjacent chair as Melb. rep. of the
“S.M.H.”
The return to Canberra of Stacey, the
member for Adelaide, will be welcomed
by habitues of Parliament House.
Stacey’s feud with Brian Penton, the
political writer and novelist, had reached
an interesting stage when the election
interrupted it. Penton’s enemies hope
that the massive Stacey will take up the
pursuit again and finally rid them of
Penton by falling on him.
George Michael Prendergast is 80 years
old, has been a politician for 40 years and
has served in 15 Victorian Parliaments—
there have been 32. To mark the triple
event his party entertained him at lunch
last week and said nice things about its
old leader. He was born in Adelaide,
and that he has lasted so long is a
tribute to his toughness or to the com-
parative placidity of Victorian politics.
Since Peacock died he has had no con-
temporary in Spring-street with whom
to exchange memories of Gillies,
Deakin, Jimmy Patterson and George
Turner. Willie Watt, standing at his
first election, ousted Prendergast from
Melbourne North in 1897.. Even then
Prendy looked old enough to be Watt’s
father, but as a politician he has long
outlasted Willie.
John Masefield, whose expression of
perpetual astonishment makes him

Palace to Sydney.
readily identifiable when he leaves the
harbor of Melbourne University and
goes abroad, ran true to form when he
encountered daily-paper interviewers. He
was courtesy itself, and answered every
question, but when the pressmen went to
write him up they found they had gained
scarcely enough for a short par. English
biographers have had no better luck. A
recent work on the poet sets it down
that he was born in 1878 at Ledbury,
Herefordshire, was very miserable in his
boyhood (for reasons not stated) and at
13 joined the training ship Conway. Then
for a year or so he tramped England
and America till 1902. when he helped
to organise an exhibition of British
painting at Wolverhampton. After that
he went into weekly journalism, and then
into literature.
H. L. Archdall, senior police magis-
trate, will shortly retire. He is 66 and
the kindest of mortals. He has had a
varied experience of Queensland, and
served in most of its big towns.
Ray Parer, who with the late Mc-
Intosh made a spectacular flight from
London in ’2l, is a competitor in the
centenary air race. As on the last occa-
sion, Parer is making his effort on a
shoe-string. His is a second-hand ’plane
which he has himself got into some sort
of form to essay the most strenuous air
feat yet attempted. The Parer-Mclntosh
flight was, as Bruce said at the Royal
Aero Club dinner, “the most romantic
of all.” The ’plane, a tiny affair, was
tied up with wire and string, and neither
Parer nor Mclntosh had a five-pound
note to see them through. They used to
land with just enough to cable their
backers for some cash for a feed and
more petrol, and this went on the whole
journey. Since then, Parer has been
earning his living flying in New Guinea,
and now he is staking everything on the
big race. Every Australian will wish
him luck.

The slip in last year’s figures was due
mainly to a special adjustment of ac-
counts with the smelters at Port Pirie.
Metal prices strengthened a trifle, and
the exchange premium, which accounted
for the whole of the profit from mining,
and more besides, was steady at' £25 per
cent. Fewer crudes were hauled, but
they were mined and milled at less cost,
the ore was richer, and the aggregate lead
content greater than for the previous
year. Also, more was received for zinc
concentrates (they are sold under con-
tract to Electrolytic Zinc and Imperial
Smelting Corp.) and there was a further
reduction in smelting charges, thanks to
the advance in recoveries, etc., at Port
Pirie, where recent achievements have
attracted attention overseas.
After making the adjustments already
referred to, the board figured net earn-
ings £20,459 short of the previous year’s :

Investments .. .. 106,855 85,906 80,671
£117,225 £240,673 £220,214
The difference between the profits
claimed and those shown in the intro-
ductory table represents unexplained
additions to reserves. The £220,214 was
equal to ss. 6d. per share, and 55., as
against 3s. in the previous year, was
distributed ; the outlook is less uncertain
than it was a year ago.
Excluding the mine and plant, but in-
cluding £771,805 invested in shares in
cos. in allied industries, the net improve-
ment in the financial position was
£18,674:

That was after spending £41,663 on
plant, in at £1,215,127 ; the mine is un-
changed at £83,694. Since 1927 approxi-
mately £lOO,OOO has been spent on sink-
ing a new main shaft, £371,137 on flota-
tion and other plant, installation of which
is not yet complete, and £lOO,OOO has
been invested in a central power scheme.
It is all part of the plan to lower costs
from the high level of the post-war boom.
What has been achieved in this way
over the last five years the following
table shows:
1929. 1933. 1934.

The total cost of extraction, treatment
and development was lowered by
Is. 5.6 d. a ton last year, making the
drop since 1929 13s. 2d., to which wage
adjustments also contributed. Nearly
half of last year’s stone came from below
the 1070 ft. level, and assayed over 16
p.c. lead.
The metal content of the concentrates
and percentage of recoveries compare as

The figures do not include recoveries
from the lead residues, or the lead in
the zinc concentrates or the zinc in the
lead concentrates. It is all a fine testi-
mony to the efforts of the staff to lower
costs and help earnings.
Ore reserves are unchanged at
3,500,000 tons, and there is a lot of
payable stuff, already partly proved by
the drill, outside the measured area.
What the future holds for lead it is
difficult to say. Production still runs
ahead of consumption, and the London
spot quote for the metal was £lO ss.
last week-end as against an average of
£ll 16s. 7d. for the year to June 30 last.
The market prices the pound shares
at 755. 6d. as against 645. 6d. a year
ago and 51s. 12 months before that. At
755. 6d. the immediate return is 6.6 p.c.
on a 25 p.c. div. basis.

To have built up in 22 years a retail
trade organisation in which over four
millions of money is now invested was
the extraordinary achievement of Sydney
Myer, founder and governing director
until his death on Sept. 5. The foun-
dations of the present business were laid
in 1911, when he bought a controlling
interest in Wright and Neil, Bourke-
street. Capacity to look ahead, to
live and work with extraordinary energy,
and to surround himself with able
assistants were among his outstanding
qualities. Lee Neil, who contributed
much to the co.’s success in the past,
fills the gap, and executives have all been
trained in the business ; so continuity of
the policy which has put the co. where
it is appears to be assured.
Progress was most marked during
the second half of the last term,
when structural alterations were out of
the way. The mills at Ballarat (they
were bought in 1918, and keep the co.
supplied with fashion cloths, underwear,
etc., at manufacturers’ prices) helped to
swell the pool, and so did the Adelaide
business (it used to be James Marshall
and Co., whose ords. were bought in ’2B
at 30s. apiece), which sent along 6 p.c.
as against 5 p.c. the year before. After
meeting some non-recurring expenditure,
and making a partial restoration of the
20 p.c. salary cut of 1930, the net result
was £8736 better. It was enough to
pay the pref. and staff-partnership divs.
(together £64,583) and show 9.3 p.c. on
the £1,725,000 of ord. capital as against
8.9, 8.2, 5.1, 10.9, 14.6 and 15.5 p.c. back
to 1928. The div. was kept at 6 p.c., and
£46,000 was set aside to meet the
next tax bill when it arrives ; hitherto
no such provision was made.
The market notes this and the cen-
tenary celebrations, which should give
the current term’s earnings a lift, and
prices the ords. at 335. 3d. as against
16s. 6d. three years ago. At the higher
figure the return is 3.6 p.c. on a 6 p.c.
div. basis, or 4.8 p.c. on an 8 p.c. distri-
bution, which appears to be well within
reach. The 9 p.c. cum. prefs. (there are
655,450 of them) at 365. 6d. return 4.9
p.c. The net tangible cover is -£4 ss.
prefs. and 295. sd. ords.

flected in balance-sheet figures:

in the more or less liquid surplus
(£285,183, including stocks but not shares
in other cos.) was £52,928.

prefs. are not subject to the N. S. Wales
Interest Reduction Act, the co. being
registered in England. In front of share-
holders is £500,000 of first-mortgage de-
bentures, secured on the co.’s freeholds—
£lo,ooo, making £40,000 in all, was paid
to the trustees of the sinking fund during
the last term. These were issued in ’27
to help finance the new building ; they
mature in ’39, and the interest has been
reduced by statute from 6 p.c. to 5 p.c.
At the end of July the floating debt was
£221,881 ; it includes an unspecified
amount on overdraft and something for
contingencies. Fixed charges, therefore,
pressed heavily upon reduced earnings,
which fell short of pref. div. requirements
for the three years to the close of ac-
counts in ’33, and the ords. (they had re-
ceived a steady 10 p.c. for the nine years
to the end of July, ’29) went without for
the first time since the present co. took
over the business in 1897.
During the last term, the London buy-
ing organisation was overhauled, savings
were made in other directions, and a
mord vigorous merchandising policy was
pursued. Also, there was a better de-
mand for high-grade goods, for which
the co. continues to enjoy a wide repu-
tation. Net earnings more than doubled,
despite fiercer competition, which in
some quarters took the form of so-called
“free gifts,” a policy at which Farmer’s
looks askance. The £70,339 netted was
enough to pay the pref. divs. and show
7.5 p.c. on ord. capital, and 5 p.c. was
distributed.
Prospects of further improvement in
the figures are encouraging. The market,
therefore, prices the ords. at 235. 3d. as
against 16s. 7d. a year ago. The return
at the higher figure is 4.3 p.c. on a 5 p.c.
div. basis, or 5.1 p.c. on a 6 p.c. distri-
bution. At 255. and 275. the first and
second prefs. yield 4.8 p.c. and 5.1 p.c.
respectively. The net tangible cover is
£6 2s. 2d. first; £2 11s. Id. seconds ; 31s.

The co. operates three plants in S. Aus.
and one at Geelong (Vic.), and has a
£90,000 share interest in Cresco Fer-
tilizers (W.A.) as well. The contraction
in last year’s figures was due to (1)
keener competition, which means price-
cutting, and (2) shrinkage in the demand
for super. Owing to disappointing spring
rains, fewer acres were planted with
wheat and there was less grain in the
ears: —•

The average price was 2s. 9.5 d. per bushel
as against 2s. 11.7 d. for the previous
season, which meant that farmers gener-
ally were unable to buy enough super,
to apply heavy top-dressings, notwith-
standing the Federal wheat bounty and
a fertiliser subsidy of 15s. per ton.
Although the co. branched out into the
manufacture of sidelines with a measure
of success —dusting and atomic sulphur
were put on the market, and copper car-
bonate will be presently—gross earnings
(£83,284) fell away £30,277. Exes.
(£60,608) were pulled back £26,376, due
mainly to the absence of provision for
depreciation, for which liberal allowance
is said to have been made in former
years. After paying the pref. divs. (to-
gether £6690), enough remained to show
a shade over 2.5 p.c. on the £625,450
of ord. capital as against 3.1 p.c. and 1.6
p.c. for the two preceding terms. The
div. was lowered to 2\ p.c., making the
average for the last five years 1.3 p.c.
A feature of the accounts is that since
1930 debtors’ balances have been re-
duced by £368,302, which is a fine testi-
mony to the efforts of the farmers to

After a 12-years’ wait and loss of four-

lopped off in 1925 to cover fire and other
losses and rub out £BO,OOO of goodwill—
the ords. have got into the picture with

The table summarises the p. and 1,
figures of the parent, which owns the
scrip (£480,527), or all but a fraction of
it, in two manufacturing subsidiaries,
Lincoln Spinning Mills and Lincoln
Knitting Mills ; and until the close of
accounts in 1931 it owned little else.
After that it undertook distribution of
the subsidiaries’ outputs. There were
savings, and, as conditions improved,
prices and stocks became less trouble-
some, to the benefit of earnings.

The property, which is situated at Kanowna, comprises 96 acres and has
been very favorably reported upon by H. E. VAIL, ESQ., M.lnst.M.M., M.1.M.M.E.,
Consulting Engineer to Wiluna Mines, Ltd., Triton Gold Mines, Ltd., Western Mining
Corporation, Lake View and Star, Ltd., etc., also by the -last manager of the mine,
John Trenfield, Esq., of Wiluna, W.A. Mr. Vail, in his report, states inter alia: "I
considered the prospects sufficiently attractive (many years ago) to equip the main
shaft with a pumping plant, and at considerable expense removed the water and
inspected the underground workings ... a large winze or underground stope below
the No. 3 level was unwatered and sampled which averaged one ounce per ton over
a width of sft. Free gold was visible in the ore, and the reef appeared strong and
likely to continue to further depth. There was no means of determining the length
of the shoot without an expenditure of a considerable amount of money in plant and
development. At that time mining was at a very low ebb, and we decided not to
undertake the necessary expense and the mine was abandoned without any exploration
work being done. So far as I know, it has not since been unwatered. 1 consider
the results of sampling in t'he underhand stope sufficiently encouraging to warrant
further exploration, and, if the lode continues in depth and can be proved to extend
laterally, maintaining the widths and values then exposed in the underhand stope, it
WILL DEVELOP INTO A MINE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE. MY RECOL-
LECTION OF THIS POSSIBILITY IS FAVORABLE.

11 Millions Were Spent to
Make Her Comfortable
When she sinks back in her Holden-bodied car,
she rides in comfort and safety that an invest-
ment of £i, 5 00,000 makes possible. Without
the vast production and far-reaching rami-
fications of the Holden organisation, motor-
car bodies of Holden quality would be within
the reach of only the few—instead of the
thousands who own and enjoy them to-day.
The main Holden plant at Woodville, South
Australia, covers 40 acres, including 1,000,000
square feet of covered space. Plant and mach-
inery to a value of over £700,000 are installed
in these buildings, in which are carried huge
stocks of Australian timber, leather, steel, etc.,
and other raw material. In all, more than
£1, 5 00,000 is invested in this plant, which
employs 3400 Australians.
The plant has over 20 departments, and as
each Holden body passes through these depart-
ments, it receives no less than 1213 progress
inspections before being “ O.K.’d” for delivery.
No wonder “Body by Holden” carries such a
wealth of meaning—both as the product of a
vitally important Australian secondary industry
—and as a refinement in motoring comfort and
pride of ownership.

"—Yes, the Society will
Convert the policy into
AN ANNUITY”
THE Society’s counsellors, visiting amongst
members, frequently find that members do not
know of their privileges in regard to annuity
payments.
Any member of the Society has the privilege of
converting any sum assured payable at death (Table
A.) or any Endowment Policy (Table J.) into an
annuity, payable for any term he may elect, i.e.,
for 5, 10, 15, or 20 years after the claim has arisen
or the policy has matured. Both the original sum
assured and the accrued bonuses may be applied in
this way.
Amounts of Annuities (payable quarterly) which
may be obtained in exchange for each £ 100 of
assurance, and Bonuses are:—
Annuity payable
for
5 years
10 years
1 5 years
20 years
Amount per
annum.
£2l 17 8
£lll7 8
£ 8 12 0
£ 6 19 4
Thus, a policy for £l,OOO, to which Reversionary
Bonuses amounting to £5OO have been added, may
be exchanged for an Annuity of £1 78/5/- (in four
quarterly payments)'for 10 years.
Experienced counsellors will be glad to explain this
privilege to any member or intending member living
within reasonable distance of an A.M.P. office. To
others the Society will gladly send full information
by letter and booklets.

ASSETS £93,000,000
INVESTED IN THE COMMONWEALTH AND NEW ZEALAND
Because values in the big reef at For-
sayth (N.Q.) are too erratic. Forsayth
Gold Mines has decided to gouge out
the profitable stuff, which is expected to
return about £12,000, and then suspend
operations there until the drill shows
whether the ore-body is worth exploring
at depth. Interest now centres chiefly
in the co.’s option from Australian Min-
ing Trust over the Ingliston and Com-
modore, at Meekatharra (W.A.). These
properties are on the northern extension
of the main porphyry dyke. M. R. Mc-
Keown says they offer two possibilities:
(1) extension of the auriferous forma-
tions between the reefs or leaders already
worked, which means large-scale mining,
and (2) production from small but rela-
tively high-grade reefs, which appear to
have yielded about half an ounce to the
ton. Shareholders are not likely to be
asked for any more at present.
* * * *
At long last a start has been made at
the old Croydon goldfield (N.Q.). Gold
Mines Development, with Cliff Rutledge
supervising operations, has pumped out
the old Mountain Maid, one of the
bigger outside mines, which produced
nearly £BO,OOO worth of gold in the
’nineties. It has been worked to about
300 ft. The co. is banking on what was
left becoming payable with gold around
£8 an ounce. The line was productive for
a: length of about 1000 ft., with a reef
ranging to sft. in width and carrying lots
of gold-bearing stringers. A new float
on the main Golden Gate line of reef
will probably be the next attempt to
liven up the field.
* * * *
New Gympie Gold has touched 250 ft.
in sinking towards the Phoenix slates,
which should be got as soon as the big
conglomerate, now showing, is left be-
hind. A number of quartz veins and
leaders have been passed through, which
means that the co. has definite quartz for-
mations to crosscut for as soon as they
get the plumbago slates; in many
cases plumbago was the agent that trans-
muted buck reefs into jewellers’ shops on
this field. It is the evidence of reefs in
this shaft that again started the rush
for leases on the Great Northern area.
* * * *
The new field at Lol worth, near
Charters Towers (N.Q.), is holding inter-
est, mainly because of developments
along the Mons Meg line of formation.
Besides the decent crushings out of the
Meg, the Midas claim has just come to
light with 25 tons from a surface cut
which yielded 1250 z. ; another 50 tons
is going through.
3*e s{c H: ♦
Sydney interests have obtained an
option of purchase for £175,000 over the
Ingliston Consols Extended, which in-
cludes the Fenian, at Meekatharra
(W.A.). Dr. Larcombe has run the rule
over the show, but his report is not yet
available. The mine has been worked
by a private co. which has handed out
about £400,000 in divs., and development
and equipment have been paid for mostly
out of profits. The Extended has been
worked to a depth of 1380 ft. over a
length of 800 ft. The main lode channel
is a shear zone in greenstone complex,
associated with a porphyry dyke, which
averages from 40ft. to 50ft. in width at
the 1365 ft. level. It is at the northern
end of the lode that the future of the
mine lies; developments suggest that
values have petered out at the southern
end. A feature of the ore-body is the
presence of a mass of rich but narrow
interlacing spur veins. The increasing
size of the dyke on the lower levels has
been accompanied by a falling off in
gold values, and the two combined have
made further development by hand-drill-
ing methods unprofitable. With modern
machine drills, geologist F. G. Forman,
of the Westralian Mines Department,
considers there is fair chance of success,
particularly in lateral developments
northward on the upper levels. He also
says “the dyke is deep-seated, and there
is no likelihood of it ‘cutting out’ within
the limits of economic mining.” Still,
the tenor of the lode below 1380 ft. re-
mains to be proved. It looks like a show
requiring modern equipment and pro-
bably a lot of capital.
* * * *
Lady Miller has left the stocks in Adel-
aide with a nominal capital of £120,000
in 2s. shares, of which 650,000 have been
taken by the public and 250,000 paids
plus £20,000 cash by the vendor, leaving
300,000 shares in cold store. The inten-
tion is to open up and develop the Lady
Miller, Norseman (W.A.), from which
43,360 tons, averaging a shade under
sdwt., was taken between 1907 and 1915,
and to prospect two areas (18 acres each)
to the north and west into which the
Lady Miller lodes dip and pitch. F. J.
Coote figures that there is 21,200 tons,
averaging 7dwt., waiting to be broken
above No. 1 level (down 114 ft. on the
underlie, or 84ft. vertical), and another
34,500 tons of 12dwt. stuff between that
point and the winze in No. 2 level (300 ft.
on the underlie, or 238 ft. vertical). With
costs at 255. a ton, the profit from that
lot is put at £106,000. In addition there
is 6600 tons of 4dwt. tailings on the
southern end of the show. Prospects
centre largely in how a parallel lode,
95ft. west of the Lady Miller formation,
will open up, and upon the possibilities
of the Veni Vidi Vici lease to the north.
At a depth of 60ft., prospectors got some
rich returns from the parallel reef, the
extent and value of which have yet
to be proved. The area to the north
holds the greatest possibilities. Here
there is 6600 tons, averaging 15dwt.,
above the main level, with no walls show-
ing, and over 25,000 tons probable 14dwt.
stuff if the lode lives only to the same
depth to which it has been worked
further south. Whether recent develop-
ments at the Norseman, immediately to
the north, will be repeated in this co.’s
area remains to be seen.
* * * *
Golden Valley (W.A.) is a prospecting
concern with a nominal capital of £BO,OOO
in 2s. shares, of which 600,000 are
offered and underwritten at -jd. each
( = £1250). The vendor takes 70,000 paids
plus £13,000 cash ; the other 130,000
shares are in pickle. The property con-
sists of 96 acres, including the old Golden
Valley mine at Kanowna, on the East
Coolgardie field. The show has been
opened up to 300 ft., where the stone aver-
aged lOfdwt. In a winze below this level
ounce stuff was disclosed over a width
of sft., and the reef appeared to be
strong underfoot. H. E. Vale, John
Trenfield and W. J. Cummings all reckon
that the mine has sufficient prospects to
warrant further exploration.
* * * *
Coolgardie (W.A.) is being given
another chance. Commonwealth Mining
and Finance, one of the De Bernales
group, is installing new plant preparatory
to bogging in, shallow and deep, at Bay-
leys, and is confident that it is on a
winner. Also, the New Venture Co.,
with less cash, has sponsored two flota-
tions. Lesser lights on the field are
fairly numerous, and all are tipped to
blaze before long.
* * * *
Gold Exploration, Ltd., the new
£2,000,000 Anglo-Aust'ralian concern
which holds a controlling or large in-
terest in a number of big enterprises,
announces that it will shortly float
several Kalgoorlie subsidiaries. No.
1 will probably be the Blue Cap,
including a bit of adjacent country as
makeweight. The Blue Cap is a small
block sandwiched between Lake View
and Associated ; it was worked by the
long-defunct Central and West Boulder
Co., and was bought some time ago
for £36,000 from a local syndicate by
some of those who now control Gold
Exploration.
* * * *
Anything on the Westralian goldfields
with a past has been or is about to be
floated. One of the latest is the Little
Doris at East Mt. Margaret. It started
producing about 30 years ago, and after
successive owners got a bit of gold it
was abandoned.
* * * *
Westralia’s State Treasurer has bud-
geted for a little more taxation from the
gold-mining industry. The new im-
post, which takes only a small bite
out of profits, is expected to add
£BO,OOO a year to consolidated revenue.
The mineowners are not complaining,
but speculators are.
Jk * jfc
On the recommendation of its general
manager, J. Atkinson, Burma Malay Tin
has exercised its option over the Briseis,
at Derby (Tas.). The intention is to
float a subsidiary, Briseis Consolidated,
with A. Wilson as mine manager and a
working capital of not less than £75,000,
to handle these and probably other de-
posits in the district. Tribute parties,
which were knocking out decent cheques,
are now employed on day labor. The
work of turning the Ringarooma River
back to its old course has been started,
and H. G. Carter has gone into the ques-
tion of rebuilding the Cascade Dam, the
bursting of which spelled disaster in
1929. It was then figured that there was
over 5,300,000 c.y. of deep drift and
overburden, containing 3770 tons of t. 0.,
remaining to be sluiced. The old Briseis
Co. handed out over half a million in
divs., but costs increased as the wash
went down, and no divs. were paid after
1920.

“Bachelor Bait”
. Stuart Erwin, as slow-spoken, as diffi-
dent and as dismal as ever, runs a large-
scale matrimonial bureau which flourishes
mainly because Erwin has remarkable
talents as a writer of advertising copy.
He takes the business very seriously.
Not so seriously is it taken by Skeets
Gallagher, legal adviser to the concern
and possessor of a flood of sentimental
oratory which he gets few opportunities
to unleash. Berton Churchill is a poli-
tical boss and racketeer who tries to buy
the business, but is repulsed because
Erwin reckons he wouldn’t run it straight.
Rochelle Hudson is the beauteous secre-
tary who loves Erwin. There are O.
Henry twists to the story, and plenty of
opportunities are given for the airing of
Erwin’s characteristic brand of humor.
Eventually Erwin does sell out to
Churchill. While the sale is being effected
the premises are raided and the fittings
destroyed by the axes of the District-
Attorney’s myrmidons. Returning for
one last glimpse of his erstwhile kingdom,
Erwin, who knows nothing of the raid,
puts the havoc down to the effects of the
new management. “I knew he wouldn’t
run it efficiently,” he murmurs sadly.
Gallagher’s oratory, used to convince
Erwin that he ought to marry Miss Hud-
son, works so powerfully on Gallagher
himself and his divorced wife (Pert
Kelton) that they decide to remarry. At
Sydney Capitol.
“Spitfire”
Spitfire is Trigger Hicks, a mother-
less run-wild girl who lives in a.
rough community in the mountains
of North Carolina. She has acquired
the faith that moves mountains by
the study of a packet of Sunday-
school text-cards she snooped out
of a preacher’s pocket. She heals
the sick and raises the dead, or at least
believes that she does. A disillusionment
in love robs her of her faith, and the
mountaineers, who mentally seem to be-
long to the Stone Age, decide to kill her
because she fails to save a baby’s life.
Katharine Hepburn plays the difficult
role of the wild girl, and instils into it a
certain amount of charm and feasibility,
abetted by Ralph Bellamy and Robert
Young. The mountaineers are grotesque
caricatures. There are one or two very
impressive stage pictures unspoilt by
redundant dialogue, and these, coupled
with Miss Hepburn’s, talent, lift the piece
a little out of the ruck. At Sydney
Capitol.
“Little Miss Marker”
Child-actor prodigies are apt to prove
tiresome. Shirley Temple, the five- or
Tom Walls and Ralph Lynn in “Cup
of Kindness,” Sydney State.
four-year-old (accounts differ) leading
lady of this film, doesn’t; but then it’s
doubtful whether she does act. More
likely she just plays, and she charms
because of the evident enjoyment she
gets out of her game. She seems de-
lighted and surprised that she should be
allowed to do what she wants and that
grown-ups should join in her play.
The story is just the sort to show her
to best advantage—a rather childish fan-
tasy, but a fantasy which lies near the
bounds of possibility. The child is left
with a rather morose and soured book-
maker as security for a 20-dollar bet—
she’s a marker. Horse loses, father sui-
cides, bookmaker and his pals adopt
Robertson Hare in “Cup of Kindness,”
Sydney State.
the marker. The working out of the
story is unusual. The child dreams of a
world peopled by the characters of King
Arthur’s Court, and names the gangsters
after the story-book knights. They stage
an Arthurian party for her.
Adolphe Menjou, as “Sorrowful”
Jones, her benefactor-in-chief, finds a
better role than he has had for some
time. Towards the finish, when he gets
a new suit of clothes, he tends to de-
velop into the usual Menjou, but he
earlier gives a convincing picture of a
cynical gambler. Charles Bickford,
slightly uncomfortable in the fooling,
and Dorothy Dell are others. At the
Prince Edward.'
“The Old-fashioned Way”
W. C. Fields is manager and high
panjandrum of an American touring
troupe of the ’nineties, and the story
provides a comical burlesque, though at
times the action drags. Fields’s most
notable contribution is a conjuring act.
He’s a great conjurer—as Australia re-
members.
“One Sunday Afternoon”
At the Civic. An entertaining film
about a man who bemoans the fact
that he didn’t marry the other girl—till
he sees her. A Cavalcadish sort of story,
and the genus is becoming tiresome.
This one runs from 1900 to 1933, and
none of the characters seems to age more
than three years ; their clothes change,
that’s all. Gary Cooper is the chap who
marries Frances Fuller but who wishes
he’d married Fay Wray, and Neil Hamil-
ton the one who married Fay but
wishes he’d had a brighter idea.
“The Roof”
Another of those British detective
stories which take a long time to pass a
given point. The players seek to
achieve naturalness by underacting, and
forget that the most essential factors in
this type of film are brisk movement
and thrilling suspense. This, too, spans
a long period, starting on August 1,
1914, and drifting down to to-day. There
are two crimes—a murder and a robbery
—and just a faint hint of romance.
Sundry Shows.
Delysia made her bow to Sydney at
the New Tiv. on Saturday night, and had
no difficulty whatever in pleasing an audi-
ence so ready to be pleased that it gave
her on her first entrance the sort of recep-
tion that belongs to a very old favorite.
Whether this catholic friendliness of
Sydney first-nighters has its roots in cos-
mopolitanism or good humor none can
say, but it vastly pleases mummers and
gives an atmosphere of genial intimacy
to the subsequent proceedings.
Delysia thoroughly appreciated her
welcome, and repaid it with a worthy
performance. She deals in the humor
that lies in a glance, an inflection, a ges-
ture, and she has fun at her fingertips.
Faultless of figure, she wears superb
clothes superbly. She sings little songs
whose words don’t very much matter in
a voice which, though sweet, is not in
itself remarkable, and makes them
cameos of comicality. But she cannot
be described. She is Delysia, and there
is only one of her.
“Mother of Pearl” is two little one-act
plays followed by a farce. First act is
Pineroish, second Gilbertian, third not
worth identifying. Straus’s music is sand-
wiched into the action neatly and un-
obtrusively. Usually a play with music
is better sung than acted. That cannot
be said of this production. Frank Har-
vey, Phyllis Glen, Campbell Copelin,
Robert Coote and Harold Meade are
among those who give Delysia the sort
of support her talents deserve. Scenery
is splendid, dressing ditto and production
(Mr. Harvey’s responsibility) everything
that could be asked for.

Having given several thousand school
children a grounding in orchestral music
through the agency of Prof. Bernard
Heinze and the symphony orchestra,
the A.B.C. has been essaying to continue
the process of musical education with
its military band, not quite so successfully
as in the initial experiment. Conductor
Stephen Yorke, on the afternoon The
Bulletin attended Sydney Town Hall,
seemed to find his timetable a bit
cramping, with the result that his little
disquisitions on the band instruments and
on the compositions to be performed
were hurried and seemed perfunctory.
George Robey in “Chu Chin Chow,”
Sydney State.
With possibly one exception the selection
of music were suitable—“ William Tell”
overture, Dvorak’s “Humoreske,” a pot-
pourri from “The Gondoliers,” “The
Blue Danube” waltz, Bucalossi’s “Hunt-
ing Scene” and some rousing military
marches, all played crisply and com-
petently. Raymond Beatty laid down his
clarionet to warble Keel’s “Trade
Winds” and the “Mandalay” of Oley
Speaks. The dubious item was the first
movement of the Grieg pianoforte Con-
certo in A Minor (pianist Henri Penn,
uniformed in the scarlet of a bandsman).
Grieg wrote a hundred things that could
preferably be chosen to introduce the
characteristics of his music to a young
audience; moreover, the piano part was
at times overwhelmed by the band.
Sydney’s most promising offset to
Adelaide’s Philip Hargrave is David
Maddison, who has the bulge on Philip
in the matter of age, being but seven.
At Sydriey Con. hall on Thursday night
Master Maddison showed that he had
mastered musical foundations by playing
Bach and Handel in workmanlike fashion
and smoothly negotiating the cross-hand
skips of a Scarlatti sonata. Also, he
essayed Beethoven’s sonata, Op. 14, No.
2, and put good style into the opening
allegro. The youngster has a sense of
Wallace Beery and George Raft in
“The Bowery,” Sydney Plaza.
rhythm, and evidently enjoys his music.
With such a flying start in technique he
is to be envied whether it is his destiny
to climb to fame or not.
Melbourne is expected to keep three
companies and an orchestra of 40 in
bread and butter at the Apollo, and it
was a wise decision of Ben Fuller to
throw Johann Strauss’s hitherto unheard
“Die Fledermaus” info the grand-opera
procession. Strauss’s gay and lightsome
piece might be described as human
opera; conventional modern musical-
comedy is its degenerate offspring. It
opens with Gabriel von Eisenstein, a
gentleman of independent means (Ben
Williams), returning home to inform his
wife Rosalinda (Thea Philips) that he
has eight days to serve in gaol for a
breach of traffic rules, or something of
the sort. As Browning Mummery, a
singing master, has just previously
climbed through the window and made
advances to the lady, and, departing,
promised melodiously to return, this in-
formation is received with equanimity.
A highly amusing trio then ensues be-
tween Williams, Philips and that ex-
tremely capable buffoon Octave Dua as
Dr. Blind, the lawyer.
The next act repairs to the ballroom of
Count Orlofsky’s palace, and drags a
trifle, but is redeemed by the inter-
polation of a ballet to the tune of
Strauss’s special claim to fame, “The
Blue Danube.” The last act takes the
action to the prison-director’s office,
where Eisenstein comes to serve sentence,
only to find his spouse’s lover doing the
sentence for him. This act is genuinely
funny. The whole company showed a
remarkable talent for natural fooling
which, considering the deeds of blood
and darkness they have hitherto been
engaged in, was as surprising as if they
had suddenly turned out to be first-class
heavy-weight lifters, sword-swallowers
and contortionists. In this respect, Ben
Williams was as excellent as Booth Hit-
chens, and Browning Mummery and
Bernard Ross were as good as either.
Appleton Moore was admirable as a
drunken warder, but the palm goes to
Francesca Duret as the lady’s maid.
In view of the reception given to the
piece on Saturday night, the Fullers
could do worse than play the rest of the
Italian operas in their repertoire in bur-
lesque. Not much change would be
needed.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Ela”: Someone wrote in The Bul-
letin lately that the Papuan is the true
democrat. Reading some evidence given
in a Port Moresby police court by a
native shop assistant, I am not so sure.
Asked if he was in the habit of wrapping
up all goods purchased, or apparently
purchased, he said he was. Parcels for
gentlemen were done up in brown paper ;
for other people newspaper was con-
sidered good enough. One wonders what
his definition of “gentleman” was.
Possibly that of the waiter in Surtees’s
“Soapy Sponge”—“a gent, who always
keeps a box of cigars and a decanter of
port wine on his dressing-table.”
* * * X
“Gema”: Apropos of horses and
sudden death'(B. 19/9/’34), at Glenferrie
(Centenaryville) 30 years ago a train
dashed through a railway crossing, and a
waiting horse reached out for his harp.
The owner made himself immortal by
saying that he had never seen his nag
wait for a train to run over him before.
* * * *
“W.P.T.”: At La Perouse (Sydney) I
watched a cheeky magpie set itself alight.
After diving repeatedly at a picnic party
near the obelisk he flew off with a box
of wax matches. Investigating the con-
tents, he burst into flames and flew off in
the direction of the golf course, using
language that he must have picked up
on the links.

“Tripod”: Spinifex is useful for other
things besides “spring mattresses” (B.
26/9/’34). For thatching bough-sheds
and breakwinds it surpasses even blady
grass. Laid on and then beaten flat with
a sapling it wears itself into a thick mat
which keeps out the sun and dust, but
allows plenty of fresh air to enter. Owing
to its resinous nature, a spinifex hut
should be built away from the camp-
fire, otherwise it may disappear in some-
thing resembling a lightning flash.
“Williami”: The hot-stone-walking
Fijian (B. 19/9/ ’34) is misreported. The
fire-walking is not a perennial attraction
at Suva; the only Fijian isle where the
rite has ever been practised is Kadavu,
about 60 miles south of Suva. The per-
formance takes place only on rare and
special occasions, such as during the
visit of a great white chief. Professor
Laby notwithstanding, they do walk on
the hot stones with bare feet, and not'
on wet mud-stones. A long trench 4ft.
deep is dug, and white-hot stones are
thrown in. To prove that these stones
are the dinkum article, the walkers be-
fore entering the trench throw dry leaves
into it. The leaves never reach the
stones ; they burst into flame from the
heat and go up in smoke. The walkers
jump into the trench, trot along the
stones, dance and half squat down. They
turn back and leave the trench at the
point where they entered it. Their feet
are as soft as the feet of a newly-born
baby. Not more than one in 50 Fijians
at Kadavu can perform the miracle, and
no Fijian anywhere else can.

“R. 0.8.”: Exiled kookaburras (B.
22 /8 / ’34)? I was one of the early ones
to advance on Villers-Bret. in April,
1918. Just on the outskirts stood a large
chateau, in the grounds of which was
an enormous aviary where many varie-
ties of birds were kept. The morning
after we established ourselves near by we
were delighted to hear the laugh of Jack.
Quite a few Diggers should still remem-
ber that place.
“Dinah Mite”: Touching these kooka-
burras that won’t laugh. When Bill
Anderson put on his “Squatter’s Daugh-
ter” at the Melbourne King’s he had a
pair of Jacks legroped to the scenery to
supply “atmosphere”—and laughs, it'
possible. On the first night the spotlight
man trained a pencil ray on them, and
“Reminds me, Dave, I got t' get some o’ them things fer mum."
the pair broke out in a hearty cackle
of hilarity. But that was the only occa-
sion during the run of the piece on which
they laughed. Bill Anderson attributed
it to their having heard the comedian
on the opening night.
* * * *
“S.G.”: One of the best examples
of protective coloration I have encoun-
tered is a small spider which frequents
the belar scrubs of s.-w. Queensland.
He makes the fissures in the bark his
home, and so exactly do his markings
resemble those on the bark that, unless
he happens to be disturbed, it is impos-
sible to locate him. - He is quite aware of
the fact, too, and takes a lot of shifting
from his hiding-place.
* * * *
“Waranbini”: Landowners in the
Bowral (N.S.W.) district are complaining
that wombats “have increased alarm-
ingly, and may become a greater menace
than the rabbit.” The wombat has
disappeared from many of its old-time
haunts, and is already a curiosity to most
Australians. Two exceptionally-favored
localities are Bowral and Batlow. A
few years ago the Batlow P.P. Board
was paying for as many as 1500 scalps
a month. Then the bonus was abolished,
members declaring that the animal, after
all, was “only a doubtful nuisance.” The
crime laid against it is breaking through
netted fences, leaving gaps for rabbits
and hares. Away from such barriers
and cultivation paddocks, the wombat
is a peaceful and harmless animal. It is
also useful; stockmen declare that the
skin makes the best leather for seats of
saddles and is more durable lor boot
soles than common leather.
* * * *
“R.R.”: Sam Anderson gave the abo.
equivalent to a horse-laugh when told
about “Sa Tiko’s” par. (B. 26/9/’34)
asserting that after 30 years Binghi s
sight becomes unreliable with close-
range focussing. Sam is as black as
black, and is the most prolific batsman
in Kyogle (N.S.W.) district cricket, hav-
ing been a consistent high-scorer for
more years than most of the younger
generation can remember. No one
knows his age, but it is estimated vari-
ously at from 65 to 75. Sam isn’t an ex-
ception, either. Bob Yarry, Wiangarie’s
star trundler, is an aggressive bat and
an almost flawless fieldsman, and it’s
problematical whether he will see 50
years again.
* * * *
“Abatwar”: In a consignment of
cattle lately treated at the Brisbane abat-
toirs were two beasts that beat the Com-
monwealth meat inspectors. Outwardly
they were in good condition, and the
post-mortem failed to reveal any trace
of disease of flesh or organs ; but the
bones presented a problem. Instead of
white they were of a light chocolate
color. Disease, or were they merely
freaks? They were condemned, any-
way.
* * * *
“Tom Willie”: “Timothy Tywire” is
wrong in assuming that a bushfire travels
slower than the wind (B. 3/10/’34); it
really moves faster. On a still day it
may reach a speed of 20 miles an hour. I
remember a windless day when a great
bushfire swept through the Junee
(N.S.W.) wheat district to Combanning,
10 miles from Temora, and burnt thou-
sands of acres of crop. Old hands said
that the fire would stop at Old Junee-
road—two chains wide and cleared —but
it jumped the road on its own wind and
licked up the crops, burning horses to
death—they couldn’t be unharnessed in
time. Doesn’t “T.T.” know that a fire-
break is always burnt against the wind?
If the fire didn’t create an opposing
draught stronger than the prevailing
wind, how could this be done?
* * ❖ *
“Megaptera”: Whales in Queensland
waters, is it? Every year great schools
of humpbacks cruise northward in March
and April, making a passage from the
Antarctic, to breed in the equatorial
waters north and east of Papua. In
September and October they return again
with the youngsters, down all the east
coast and southward of Tasmania, to
the Antarctic Drift. They are then in
poor condition, for tropic waters contain
little food for whalebone whales, al-
though the toothed sperms thrive there
on squid and octopus. Humpbacks run
up to 50 or 60 feet, and blow a short,
broad double “spout” of breath vapor,
arching the back as they blow —hence
the name. They are of little commercial
value, the whalebone being short' and
the blubber thin. Most of the steamer-
passenger yarns anent terrific combats
witnessed between threshers and whales
are really dependent on a glimpse of
love-making between a pair of hump-
backs, slapping each other with their 13-
foot flippers and floundering about at
the surface. The remainder are attacks
by killers —really fierce, cannibal dol-
phins, the most formidable beasts in the
seas. The thresher is a shark with an
elongated tail which would make about
as much impression on a whale as a
dogwhip would on a hippopotamus. Its
purpose is to stun small fish, not to
wallop .whales.
* * * *
“Marsh”: I’ve never sampled “Red
Bill’s” waterhen (B. 19/9/’34), but the
fowl’s little brown cousin that inhabits
waterholes and lagoons after storms
makes fine “goose-feed” in W.Q. Not
much bigger than a pigeon, the little
red-legged waterhens are quite on a par
with squab or wild duck as a delicacy.
One peculiarity is their sense of smelling
a storm. They’re here to-day and a
hundred miles away to-morrow. Does
anyone know where the birds get to in
a drought period? Binghi doesn’t.
* * * #
“Airline”: “Fish soup?” said the boss
incredulously. “And mighty good at
that. Where’d you get the fish from?”
A fair question, seeing the nearest river
was 50 miles away. But Joe, erstwhile
shearers’ cook, merely grinned and
pointed to the bore-drain on which we
were camped. “Bobbies!” he said
laconically. Being a secretive sort of
cove, Joe never divulged the exact recipe
of his tasty concoction ; but boil them till
the bones go to the bottom of the sauce-
pan, strain off the liquid, add a little
condensed milk to it, a pinch of herbs,
salt and pepper to taste, and you won’t
go far wrong. Judging by the hole in
the butter that day, Joe may have added
that, too, but he always was extravagant.
* % sjs H*
“Bait Caster”: Let “Turn Turn” (B.
3/10/’34) continue to rage because many
Aboliars assert that fish invariably swal-
»low other fish head first. He says that
the live bait is swal-
lowed tail first, and
bases his assertion on
the fact that he has
done a lot of fishing
for game fish in the
Solomons. All that
he proves is that he
is a better fisherman
than observer. The
most-noted writers on
big-game fishing, in-
cluding Zane Grey,
record that fish like
tarpon and swordfish
invariably swallow
their bait head first,
though they may have
caught it sideways or
tail-on. It is this
habit which causes
many big fellows to
toss the bait away be-
fore they are hooked
—the preliminary grab
has shown something
.suspicious. “R ur u”
(B. 29/8/’34) gives a
simple explanation of the process. Fish-
ing for swordfish in the Indian Ocean,
he has noted that the bait is killed at the
first grab, turned and swallowed head
first. Many other authorities give the
same explanation.
* * * *
“Ela-Tauna”: The natives of the
Kumusi (Papua) are a curious lot, being
disrespectful to each other in speech and
manner. Particularly the women. They
are expert linguists in a certain vocabu-
lary coined by the constabulary. It’s not
uncommon for a wife charged with adul-
tery to be ordered from the court for
interrupting her husband’s evidence with
a few “no fears.”
* * * *
“Tom Willie”: White cockatoos (B.
19/9/’34) don’t roost in dead trees, but
use them only for observation purposes.
When King Cocky and his subjects
in a dead tree at “close-up dark” his
majesty has a well-considered plan in his
royal nut. You can bet that his bed-
chamber, in the form of a leafy tree, is
near by ; and he is either contemplating
his next breakfast or locating a late
supper. Cockatoos are the latest-feeders
among the bush birds, bar the jacky; and
cocky, like jacky, will often fly home in
the early darkness none the worse for
the day out with his cobbers.
* * * *
“Marron”: “Kali” (B. 12/9/’34) has
missed a treat. They must have had a
surfeit of fish at Cocos, or else been
ignorant of the albacore’s culinary value ;
otherwise the fish wouldn’t have been
used for manure. Many of these deep-
sea fish are caught by the snapper boats
operating from Geraldton (W.A.); they
are not heaved back into the blue, either.
The fish is cut crosswise into slabs about
an inch thick and smoked. Cooked after
the manner of fillet of cod, there is no-
thing nicer, and I’ve sampled most
varieties, of smoked fish.
TRAMPIN’ BACK TO MELBIN WITH
ME SWAG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1 was in th’ desert country at the back o’
Camooweal,
Pokin’ round among th’ sands in search of
gold,
Wen the wireless in th’ township brought that
magical appeal,
An’ it wasn’t long before me swag was
rolled.
’Twas me old home town that called me; T
was quickly under way—
You can bet your boots me footsteps didn't
lag.
Though a long road lies before me, l will git
there some fine day,
For I’m trampin’ back to Melbin with me
swag.
Trampin’ back — trampin’ back o’er th’ tong
an’ lonely track,
I'll be on the spot w’en Melbin celebrates;
Into Bourke-street I will wander, an’ a bob or
two I’ll squander
Drinkin’ pots o’ “Vic.” an’ “Carlton” with
me mates.
I keep thinking of th’ city in th’ days now past
an’ gone,
An’ I picture how a feller would enjoy
Sinkin’ one or two at Hosie’s an’ a stroll up
Little Lon.,
Or a journey down th’ “narrers” of Fitzroy.
I ’ave done a bit of ridin’ on a pushbike as
a kid,
An’ I useter own a decent sorter nag;
But I now am forced to foot it —I have neither
moke nor grid—
So I’m trampin’ back to Melbin with me
swag.
Many cars go whizzin’ past me as along th’
road I stroll,
But not one of them will give a bloke a lift.
Still, I’m not th’ least bit worried—l keep
headin’ for me goal;
Though I’m gittin’ on in years, I still can
shift.
Th’ ole frame keeps growin’ weary as I grimly
plod along,
An’ me knees are stiff an’ seem inclined to
sag;
But me purpose it is steadfast, an’ th’ will to
win is strong,
As I’m trampin’ back to Melbin with me
swag.
Trampin’ back — trampin’ back, with a big an
weighty pack,
An’ no fear of bein’ lumbered on ‘‘th’ vag.”;
W’en th’ Dook lands in October {if 1 manage
to keep sober)
I’ll be trampin’ into Melbin with me swag.

oughly bad egg. Dad didn’t wait for
any more. Pulling the earphones from
his head he glared angrily around
him. “Cripes!” he cried. “That ain’t
no fairy story. Why, three parts of the
cows in these parts are like that!”
* * * *
“Pourri-Pourri”: Everyone knows
that one of the great obstacles to civilis-
ing fairly primitive peoples is their intense
belief in devil-magic and witchcraft,
whether they are professed Christians or
not. Papuan and N.G. authorities can
speak feelingly on This subject, and they
“Tog y’self up like a sin-shifter, Joe, an’ it’s easy!”
are only two instances in a hundred.
Kenya Colony is tackling the problem.
It is collecting the numerous witch-doctors
on the great Lumbwa native reserve and
deporting them to a spot hundreds of
miles away where they will be ringed
about by alien folk who know little about
them. What the poor beggars will do
for a living outside hard work goodness
only knows. Probably they will set up
a sort of Macquarie-street, and share
what business there is out among them-
selves.
“W.P.T.”: Do birds commit suicide?
Recently I saw an injured magpie fly
straight at a stump, hitting it with ter-
rific force, and fall to the ground dead.
Its neck was broken. Another time I
saw a kingfisher dive from a great height
to a flat rock. Its head and beak were
smashed to pulp. Both looked like cases
of suicide to me.
* * * *
“Froggo”: Moving a stone in the
rockery I turned up something new in
the frog line. It was only an inch and a
half long, evidently fully grown. Color
was a delicate, almost transparent,
creamy-brown, with a few burnt-sienna
outline markings; queerest feature, a
heavily-defined brilliant red cross on the
back. Any Abo. naturalist know it?
* * * *
“Greek God”: Don’t see “Laetitia’s”
need to travel up the Fly River (N.G.)
to see a horde of fireflies shed their
igcandescence about the landscape
(B. 12/9/’34). With a party I was
hiking through a North Queens-
land scrub between Gordonvale
and Yungaburra one moonlit night.
We came to a part of the Little
Mulgrave Valley so closed in that
the moon’s pale light
hardly penetrated, but
literally lighting up the
scene was a mass of
phosphorescence that
towered to the height
of the casuarinas along
the river’s course.
When the awe had
passed everybody knew
all about it. It was merely millions of
fireflies that covered branches and twigs
of the she-oaks. Even the most coarse-
grained of us became poetic.
# * * *
“Old ’Un”: As far as I can gather,
there isn’t much to choose between Port
Moresby and Sydney nowadays. Port
has the advantage, indeed, that there
are no nerve-racking trams or earbiters
anxious to give you a moral for the lars’:
but otherwise—well, take the case of
Leoni-Gago, a lady of Tatana, charged
with shoplifting from four stores in
one morning. She had two confederates
with her, in the approved professional
style, and these concealed the stuff she
handed them—where, heaven knows,
since the P.M. native ladies wear nothing
but a shortish grass petticoat. The goods
lifted included silk bloomers, groceries,
face powder and rouge. The lady’s com-
plexion and that of her friends would
be the rich brown of a Christmas pud-
ding, so the choice of the last two items
should intrigue these anthropologists we
hear so much about. The loot was
located in a canoe in which the party
was preparing to sail for home. In
King’s Cross or Surry Hills taxis are the
vogue, one understands. The result of
it all was six months’ hard for those con-
cerned —more than the average Sydney
beak is game to hand out.
* * *
“Deg.”: Tame quails surprise the visi-
tor to Keppel Island (Q.). These small,
plump birds run everywhere through the
grass, and will approach; humans to pick
up crumbs of bread. The place is a bird
sanctuary, and the quail have been, often
known to invade the kitchen of one of
the two permanent residents. Sea-curlews
are very plentiful on the island. They
have a slightly different cry from the
southern variety. Sea-eagles are numer-
ous, soaring over the beaches. When
the net is drawn it is common afterwards
to see a plethoric eagle on the beach,
too full of discarded fish to do more
than hold its wings well out from its
body.
“No meana da harm, meesta;
I joos’ broughta da knife to
cutta da pack!”
“Mag”: If touring or camping out on
Fraser’s Island (Q.) and you are stuck
for a gadget, just search amid the flot-
sam cast up on the main Pacific beach.
Recently a Maryborough party motor-
trucking to Indian Head had a bad blow-
out. They had no spare tyre, and it, looked
like a ten-mile walk. But a search on the
beach discovered a Dunlop tyre and
tube sound in wind and the right size.
It was put on enthusiastically, and did
30 miles without squibbing. It is now
on view in a Maryborough shop window.
* ❖ * *
“Larrapinta”: I’ll back “Wodao” when
he says that the abos. won’t camp in
ironstone country (B. 19/9/’34). In
1886 I was camping on the stony table-
lands west of Dalhousie Springs and
north of Uacumba, Centralia.
The abos. had warned me
against camping on this class of
country; that night I saw the
reason. An old-man dry thun-
derstorm came up, and the light-
ning darted in crackling streaks
along the ground. Hastily shift-
ing camp into a dry creek-bed,
from it I watched a most hair-
raising display of celestial fire-
works. The flashes danced over
the stony ground, raising spurts
and streaks of dust with a noise
like volleys of rifle fire ; next
morning the mosaic pavement
of the tableland was covered
with black streaks, ridges and
furrows where the lightning had
been playing. It convinced me
that Binghi knew what he was
talking about, and thereafter I
avoided ironstone country when
thunderstorms were about.

“L.H.S.”: Have always cre-
dited the frill lizard with a true
Australian love of the sun, but
hadn’t suspected him of indulg-
ing in aquatic sports until re-
cently. “Frill” was “sunning”
on a log near a river bank when
I noticed him. Presently he moved to
the end of the log and executed a perfect
swallow-dive, then swam back. - After
further sunbaking the performance was
repeated, and so on for about a quarter
of an hour.
* * * *
“Arc. forsteri”: “Bogaduck” is right as
to the aggressiveness of bull seals at
mating time (B. 26/9/’34). But as
patient husbands and doting fathers they
set an example to all mammalian crea-
tures. Their wooing methods are abrupt,
but once the families arrive—towards
the end of November and the beginning
of December—they treat their harems and
babies with the utmost tenderness and
affection. The nursing mothers quarrel
savagely amongst. themselves, and have
no hesitation in putting it across the
other cats with teeth and flippers. The
bull separates the scrapping, scolding
ladies, gathers up the bleating pups and
stands by until they are being fed once
more. A month and more of this sort
of domestic strain, spent without food
and added to the previous job of beat-
ing off gay young bachelor interlopers,
reduces him to a haggard shadow of his
former portly self. Were he not a very
paragon of husbands, he would forswear
matrimony for the rest of his days and
live as do the bachelors and flappers of
his race —until their turn comes —a merry
life of fishing and jollity. It is this same
excellence as house fathers which led to
the almost complete extinction of the
species over a century ago, at the hands
of the most ruffianly set of international
rascals who ever infested the blue seas,
and to the ruin of what might have been
a valuable Australian sea industry.
* * *
“Rindy”: Time had brought one dis-
ability after another to the aged cart-
horse, the last being the loss of every
hair in his tail. Big-headed, gaunt and
spavined, the truncated cone made him
the last word in equine absurdity, and
left him the prey of every tormenting fly.
Friends contrived to meet the situation.
They tied to his tail-stump two-foot-six
of rope, and at the end of that a Turk’s-
head brush. Dobbin was a fly-flicker
again. It was a sight to see him lumber
up to anyone willing to make an audi-
ence and give his artificial tail a couple
of preliminary wangles before swishing
a tormentor.
* * * *
“Yo Ho, etc.”: The cabled news that
a new R.N. survey sloop named The
Torch is being commissioned for Pacific
waters will recall to old B.N.G. hands
who happen to be still living the original
craft of the name and her hospitable
wardroom. For many years she cruised
round the Western Pacific, esteemed by
all who knew her. Then one day it was
decided to take her to Sydney for a sur-
vey. The way of it was this: The
appointed authorities were inspecting
the ’tween decks below the waterline
when the carpenter noticed a suspicious
sweating in one of the plates. Jabbing
it with his finger he was staggered when
the digit went through and was followed
when withdrawn by a jet of water.
Experts decided it was quite impossible
to rivet a small plate over the hole, since
the strake itself was just a crust of rust.
Here a tiffy got a brain-wave. Cadging
a champagne cork from the wardroom
steward, he had himself lowered over-
board in a bowline, having first soaked
the cork in hot water. The hole was
easily located, and the champagne cork
shoved in until the flat-sided mushroom-
top was firmly jambed against the plat-
ing by the pressure of water outside.
Inside, the others had ready a steel washer
which they slipped over the hot cork,
and this, expanding, held the job taut and
trig as a post-captain’s fancy bit. At
Garden Island and Cockatoo the idea
was the admiration of the 'dockyard folk,
but the surveyors insisted on some hun-
dreds of pounds’ worth of new plates
going into the hull before the ship
cleared for England.
THE TANIWHA
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[The taniwha is the Maori bunyip.]
By the gloomy tides of Milford Sound
Men tell of the taniwha,
Of its gasping breath, like a hunting hound,
Of its scaly feet on the stony ground:
But nobody knows what Sutherland found
That night by the Maori pah.
Old Sutherland long had lived beside
The peaks and the beaches bare.
And his story went that in the tide
A taniwha grim he’d oft descried
Which came, he reckoned, his steps to guide
To something hidden there.
Saurian grim of the ancient times,
In bony armor bound,
It knew the place where the rock path climbs,
Where Maori singers made their rhymes,
And the bell of a long-lost whaler chimes
With a faint and ghostly sound.
The taniwha came to Sutherland’s place,
And thrice it circled there,
Like some loathly hound in a grisly chase;
Faster and faster became its pace
Till a candle gleamed on the old man’s face
And his old eyes bent to stare.
The taniwha signed to Sutherland then;
It swung its scaly tail,
Its blood-red eyeballs Hashed again
As it led the last of the Lonely Men
Over the beach by the tui’s glen
■ And away where the shadows sail.
Sutherland went with the ghostly thing,
Alone in Milford Sound,
Round by the rocks where the spectres sing
And the glassy tides in the moonbeams swing;
But none, till the Day of Reckoning,
Will know what Sutherland found.
By the rugged rocks on that lonely shore
Old Sutherland’s sleeping well.
And Sutherland’s taniwha comes no more
Where the west winds sigh, where the high
peaks soar,
And the drowned crews lie on the. ocean floor
By the old lost whaler’s bell.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
WOOL TYPES.
“Murrawong”: “Sheepo” (B. 3/10/’34)
is correct in assuming that I still want a
64’s merino regarded as medium type
and a 70’s as fine. It is also truth that
“the only difference in spinning capacity
between these two types is in what the
buyers think.” The difference between
a 60’s and a 64’s —actually a smaller
margin than the other —also depends on
the buyer’s thoughts, yet “Sheepo” pro-
poses to share the small margin between
strong- and medium-type sheep and hand
the greater range over to one type —
the fine wools.
In any case, 60’s, 64’s and 70’s are
definitely recognised types, whereas
“Sheepo’s” proposed “common . 60’s”
and “super 60’s” mean different things
to different people and nothing whatever
to the average man.
My standards may be wrong, but they
tally with those of leading wool-valuers
and -buyers. I am also in accord with
the types shown in The Bulletin Wool
Card, which I suggest as a common
basis of comparison.
If “Sheepo” went through the bins of
all the repackers and mills in Sydney he
would hardly find two principals with
exactly the same ideas and limits. It is
not so much that their views of spinning
counts vary as that they sort to certain
types to suit individual buyers or branches
of the trade. The chance visitor or new
man at the game who sets his standards
by any one repacker’s types is storing up
trouble.
The only method by which any finality
can be reached at shows is for a central
body of experts—representatives of
brokers, buyers and the Government
wool expert —to select actual samples of
wool as standards for each section-
strong, medium, fine and superfine.
Samples of matched types could be avail-
able for classing and exhibition at every
sheep show, so that any cocky who felt
he was being victimised would be able
to place the responsibility where it be-
longed.
SHEEPYARD TECHNIQUE.
“B-Gar”: It’s not the type that matters
so much as the condition of the yards
and their environment. Yard-builders
should give the bugle-type a wide berth ;
watered or unwatered it’s the kind that
helps to make wool dusty.
Money spent on watering facilities is
returned the first year. No sheepyard is
complete without a spray. More dust is
picked up in the wool in one day’s pre-
shearing drafting in unwatered yards
than in 12 months in the paddocks.
Spray the yards first, rake up and
burn all refuse and then spray again
before the sheep enter. Spray when dust
clouds rise during drafting.
Paddock brakes should be erected for
lamb-marking, but when graziers think
no harm will ensue from using the
general yards for marking there should
be no stinting of strong disinfectant in
and around and on the rails of the mark-
ing pen. Once a day is not enough.
Marking refuse is often left as fly bait.
It should be raked up twice daily, and
burnt. No yard should be a blowflies’
home.
Under the law a dairy and its environ-
ment have to be kept scrupulously clean.
Health inspectors would get a shock if
they had a peep at some drafting and
lamb-marking yards
. N ? B razie . r ever a “l* r0 “6 h
keeping yards germ-free. A large per-
cenfag| J f deaths from unkn own causes
cou i d bc traced to yards full of disease.
IS DRENCHING FUTILE,
“Sheepo”: Graziers will hear with
alarm the statement of Dr. Clunies
Ross, officer in charge of the McMaster
Research Laboratory, that it is futile to
use any known drench to cope with most
internal worms in sheep,
Dr. Ross told the C.S.I.R. that fluke
could be counteracted by the use ol a
carbon tetrachloride drench. Hcemonchus
contortus, familiarly known as the
“barber’s pole,” and an inhabitant of the
fourth stomach, could be controlled satis-
factorily by several drench solutions,.but,
with the exception of these two and
hookworm (Monodontm trigonoceph,
11 , was hugely a was e
use an y known drench,
“ore startling is the a nouncc-
JP ent |hat something like m ,
thc 110 mllhons ot shce P ln Australia
are infested with some variety of worm.”
One of the outstanding features asso-
ciated with the treatment of worms is
the casualness of graziers. Many don’t
drench at all, even for treatable worms.
A post-mortem is hardly ever held.
Undoubtedly some sheep are more re-
sistant to worms than are others. I’ve
personally drenched sheep and lambs
only twice with an arsenical solution,
and later evidence suggested that the
patients had been freed of parasites. I
have likewise drenched half a dozen
times, with “reliable” mixtures, bluestone
and an arsenical solution. Relief was nil,
SELECTING RAMS.
“Valerin”: There are several ways of
doing the job.
Some buy up the rejects from an ad-
joining station. Others keep the best-
looking ram lambs out of the flock at
marking time. I knew one man who had
1200 rams to mate with his 5000 ewes.
Another kept the pick of the ram lambs
which “broke” when being brought in
for marking. He considered these adven-
turers had more masculinity than the
tame ones who followed mother into
the yard. Many years ago I saw an old
Irishman, with the aid of a jackeroo,
selecting his flock rams. The jackeroo
caught an aged sheep and declared him
too thin on top. “What rot!” thundered
his boss. “Luk at me! Bald as an igg, and
every wan of me childer with heads of
hair ye cudn’t get a pair of shears into!
Lave him be!”
PAY AND CALL THE TUNE.
“Warramulla”: “Jumbuck,” “Murra-
wong” and “Valerin” all agree that con-
tract shearing is the whole cause of
shoddy work in the woolsheds, but is
this strictly accurate?
There are contractors whose only idea
is to get through the job quickly and with
a minimum staff. Still, the person who
employs and pays them is the primary
cause of slumming. He who pays the
piper can call the tune, but if the price
he pays is not fair he should blame him-
self for unsatisfactory results. You can-
not expect a made-to-measure suit at a
hand-me-down price.
Very few of us relish the job of going
over a board, and fewer know where to
pick up a satisfactory team. The con-
tractor can do these things for us. If
he is worth engaging he should be worth
a price that will show him a profit. The
owner then should see he does do satis-
factory work in every department, and
have enough rouseabouts. Squealing
afterwards gets nowhere.
A clause in the graziers’ contract
form with contractors provides for a
stipulated percentage of shed-hands to
shearers, as “Jumbuck” wants, and it
rests with the employer to see that the
contractor provides them. Amongst the
worst contract-offenders in our district
are unqualified selectors and selectors’
sons, who are getting around with two-
stand plants. It is no wonder complaints
are made about the get-up of our smaller
clips.
The remedy is in every case in the
growers’ own hands, without reference
to any body or organisation. Pay the
price and call the tune.
BEATING THE ARGENTINE.
“Valerin”: From what I have seen
of chilled beef in. the principal markets
of Great Britain, we shall have to legis-
late the scrub bull out of action. No
matter how well prepared and handled,
inferior beef has no hope of compet-
ing with the Argentine product.
Gov.-Gen. Lord Forster, visiting a rich
inland district, remarked to me: “What
magnificent cattle country, and yet I have
never tasted worse beef!” The remark
would apply tb nearly every part of
Australia.
The first step is to suppress the use of
inferior bulls for breeding, and this can
only be done by prohibiting the use of
any but pedigree sires with a certificate
of soundness.
“The 0.D.”: “Rich. J.” says (B.
3 /10/’34) that “inconsistency has always
been our trouble,” and that “the root of
the matter lies in breeding methods.”
There’s another factor worth attention,
i.e., fodder conservation following pas-
ture improvement. The ideal for Smith-
field is a beast that has never stopped
growing, and without the factor men-
tioned a check must occur somewhere.
The English and Argentine cattle-
raisers maintain the growth of their beef
every moment from birth to death, and
the Australian must do the same.
Pasture improvement can be so man-
aged that good body-building grazing is
available throughout the year —on the
severer tablelands there are new pasture
grasses that are nutritive and succulent in
the depth of frosty winters. With fodder
conserved against a dry spell, or any
other grazing failure, the cattleman who
knows his job should succeed.
One of our worst hurdles is the Aus-
tralian’s unwillingness to be told. He
lives in a “lavish land” most of the time,
and simply will not make provision for
the bad parts of the year.
PICKING THE PROFIT-MAKERS.
“W.D.McC.”: “Bahb Dwyer” (B.
26/9/’34) is sound when he advocates
testing to select producers, but the test
must go hand-in-hand with conforma-
tion, or else in a few years “8.D.” will
have a herd of ugly nondescripts.
Recently, when judging a type and
utility class, a miserable old Jersey, to
whom I could only award 25 for points
for conformation, had a production test
showing 5201 b. of butter-fat, which
brought her into third place. The owner
took me to task. I asked how long he
had milked her, and he said 10 years, but
admitted that she had never bred a heifer
worth a d . She never will—her
figure precludes it. My experience over
40 years has been that, by and large, the
good-looker is the good producer, and it
is quite possible to select a good herd on
looks alone.
In 1918 I owned 60 head that earned
over £3OOO in 52 weeks. It took five
years to put them together, and they cost
up to £44 per head, but were worth it.
All were purchased on conformation.
Test by all means, but have confor-
mation as well if you want profit-makers.
“H.D.8.”: Tell “Bahb Dwyer” (B.
26/9/’34) that I used the word “score-
carding” in judging a dairy cow in the
wider sense, as summed up in my last
sentence —“Conformation is certainly not
a mere matter of show points.”
Agreed that there are exceptions to
every rule, but you will find that cows
with good conformation are mostly better
producers than those without it.
I am not acquainted with English
judging methods, but so long as we have
classes in our Royal Shows such as the
Peters Prize, which demands both con-
formation and production, we need have
little fear of the “pretty” cow displacing
our producer.
Certainly, continual testing is the only
way.
GRASSHOPPER BAITS.
“Rone”: Grasshoppers in plague pro-
portions are estimated to be extended
over an area of 32 million acres of
N.S.W. These ’hoppers, which are from
a few days up to four weeks old, are
the hatchings from eggs laid late last
autumn, and have been on cold storage
over winter awaiting warmth of spring
days to do the incubation trick. And
judging by the myriads observed the eggs
must have been 100 p.c. fertile. These
pests only remain in the ’hopper stage for
about six weeks, when a few days are
taken to develop a set of wings, by
which means new pastures are sought
and devastated during a further six
weeks. Then the female lays up to 400
eggs and dies, thus completing the cycle.
The only chance of controlling the
pests is whilst the insects are wingless
and feeding in swarms. An attractive
bait is prepared as follows:
Take
241 b. bran (2£ kerosene tins),
2-1- gal. water,
41b. molasses,
1-lb. arsenite of soda.
Tie the soda arsenite loosely in hessian
and suspend it in the water, which has
been brought to the boil, until all poison
has dissolved. Add the molasses and stir
thoroughly (21b. of black treacle will do
instead of molasses).
Measure the bran on to or into some-
thing which provides ample space for
mixing ; add the poison slowly, thoroughly
turning the bran to saturate every par-
ticle. A 6 x 3 sheet of flat iron placed
on a bag sheet of a larger size makes a
good mixing floor. A flat-mouth shovel
or spade should be used for mixing, or
alternatively the job may be done with
the hands, which should be smeared with
vaseline, pushing a little up under the
nails to prevent burning from the
arsenite.
My experience is that the best results
are obtained by preparing the bait late
in afternoon and spreading early in
morning.
Take what may be lifted from a tin
with the fingers without compressing, and
broadcast over the area covered by the
swarm. A few throws should be made
ahead of the swarm in the direction of
travel.
The bait, of course, is poisonous
to stock and poultry in large quantities,

RUDYARD KIPLING
Collected Dog Stories
With 113 Illustrations by G. L.
Stampa. 7/6.
An interesting detail about this
collection of stories is that it includes
“A Sea Dog,” a new tale by Mr.
Kipling which has not appeared be-
fore. Many people will also be inter-
ested to note that “Thy Servant a
Dog,” which had such an enormous
success when it first came out, is also
included, and that the whole volume
is illustrated by Mr. Stampa’s inimit-
able drawings.

“His latest novel and his best, there

Beneath the unprovocative realism of the
story there is always a sense of the poten-

and through it there run a pattern and a
rhythm of which the attentive reader will
gradually grow aware This is a book

but spread as advised it would be almost
impossible for it to do any damage ex-

“Valerin”: In fighting ’hoppers the
Australian cocky might take this tip from
the Boers and Assyrians. They plough
furrows round their crops into which the
young insects fall; with a tarred-bag
lighted they are then destroyed. In the
flying stage the swarms are diverted from
the crop by smudge fires of heaps of
weeds, which are collected round the
paddocks for that purpose. These
schemes are effective when the ’hopper
supply is moderate.
SILAGE.
G. W. Walker: As .a close friend of
Anthony Brunskill, I know that “St.
Andrews” (B. 26/9/’34) is incorrect when
he says that A.B. never made silage till
he was a comparatively wealthy man.
Mr. Brunskill admits that he met with
misfortune on the land prior to 1893
because he neglected fodder conserva-
tion, but when he leased Allonby he
made the money to purchase the estate
by making silage. He never failed to
put down pit silage in all flush seasons
afterwards.
Mr. Brunskill describes silage as one
of the cheapest forms of fodder. He
declares that it can be made for 3s. to 4s.
per ton, but if you include the expense
of making the pit and emptying it the
total cost would not be more than Bs.
to 10s. per ton. 1 make this statement
on Mr. Brunskill’s authority.
Fodder-conservation competitions were
initiated by the Sydney R.A.S. in 1926.
Official figures show that that year the
total production of silage in N. S.
was only 12,000 tons, while in 1932, after
a few years of the competitions, it was
65,000 tons. As Mr. Brunskill pointed
out, pit silage should be on every farm
in the inland areas, made in the flush
seasons from surplus crops—even self-
sown wild oats —although he agrees that
lucerne silage is best.
If every wheatgrower saved 100 tons
of pit silage there would be two million
tons next year, and it is the aim of the
R.A.S., a§ well as of country agricul-
tural associations, to set some such figure
as this as their objective.
“X.T.”: If the discussion which I
started on silage (B. 5/9/’34) has done
nothing else, it has shown how amazing
some of the misconceptions about it are.
“Sorghum,” who advocates internal fumi-
gation, for instance, is evidently a highly
practical farmer, yet he does not under-
stand the elements of fodder conserva-
tion or the simple chemical processes in-
volved in pit storage.
It seems to me that fodder conserva-
tion should be compulsory on all Crown
leases which grow a storable surplus of
crop, and financial institutions could do
a great deal by assisting farmers to make
a reasonable provision of reserve feed
against dry seasons.
There is no art in making silage be-
yond having an accessible pit which can
be economically tapped with a waggon
in well-drained ground. And the pack
must be tight, the pressure as even as
possible and the top built to shed flood-
water, though it is astonishing how little
water can penetrate a properly-made pit.
“Hope Vale”: A silage pit costs a
quarter as much as a hayshed. Hay must
have a shed if it is to be kept in good
condition for years. Silage and hay both
cut into sheaves with a binder. Silage
is harder to cart, owing to greater weight,
but this is offset —no expense is incurred
for stooking. The pit can be covered in
a day by two men with horses and scoop.
Granted that silage is hard to get out
of the wrong sort of pit, it can be fed
direct to stock without waste, whereas
hay has to be cut into chaff and trough-
ing provided. Even then wind will blow
away a great deal. Lastly, hay depre-
ciates rapidly in value, due to mice and
weather, and silage not at all. I’m all
for silage, having regard to its special
purpose.
TUBERCULOSIS IN PIGS.
“Large White”: The Queensland Meat
Industry Board has some startling figures
showing the prevalence of this scourge,
which is responsible for the condemna-
tion of more carcasses than all other com-
plaints put together. The chief source of
infection is alleged to be milk, and some
farmers are cutting it out altogether and
making up the protein balance with
meatmeals or vegetables. When milk
does not form part of the ration there is
also need for minerals, especially calcium
and phosphorus. Sterilised bonemeal is
best.
Whilst immediate action should be
taken by owners to have their cows
tested for tuberculosis, heating the milk
to 178 deg. for a quarter of an hour will
render it safe.
Apart from the need to weed out in-
fected porkers, cleanliness, including
plentiful disinfecting of sties, and the pro-
vision of a clean grazing paddock with
plenty of fresh air and sunlight are the
best preventives.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“E. 0.5.”: When shearing-machine
emery begins to lose its cutting powers
it may be revived by rubbing it briskly
with a steel-wire brush, such as is used
for cleaning files.
“Hagus”: With strangles prevention
is better than cure. My experience of
years leads me to believe that if a
dessertspoonful of Stockholm tar is put'
on the back of the horse’s tongue and a
little rubbed on the nostrils once a week
it will never get the disease.
“Billy See”: When the bottom rusts
out of a corrugated-iron tank don’t
throw it away. Reverse it and put a new
bottom in what used to be the top. Here
the iron will still be almost as good as
new. Use a lighter gauge of flat than
the original. Cement inside if desired.
“Rix”: A little dust in the wool will
easily depreciate its selling value one
penny per pound—a loss of £133 on a
flock of 4000 sheep averaging 81b. of
wool. Frequently this is an annual loss.
Most of the dust gets into the wool as
the sheep pass through the yards. It
pays to instal an overhead tank to
water the yards before use in dry
weather. An efficient plant can be con-
structed for £6O or less, and will require
little upkeep and no further outlay for
many years!
“Horsey”: The reason why “Dead
Finish” (B. 26 /9/ ’34) found sale in the
grease most payable is simple. Buyers
are not keen on buying scoured wool.
Their sorters are trained to handle
greasy lines, but are not always experts
in scoured. When long distances make
freight a consideration it is best to
use a dust-removing machine, the opera-
tion of which should cost about |d.
per lb.
“Valerin”: Never put lambs or weaners
on wheat stubble. No matter how care-
fully the crop has been harvested, enough
grain is left to cause digestive trouble
and loss. Older sheep are unaffected
unless the grain is in large quantities.
“Nicholas”: It is natural for a pig
to rub itself. If posts are provided for
the purpose the fences will be saved
and wear and tear minimised.
“S.G.”: The difficulty of holding a
wire and driving home a staple at the
same time can be overcome by the fol-
lowing simple gadget, which is made
from a piece of piping about 6in. long:
One end of the pipe is heated to a red heat
and a staple forced into the opening. A
few taps with a hammer will close the
pipe around the staple (care being taken
not to close the opening too tightly).
Staples fit snugly into the end loop or
pocket and can be driven into the post
with little trouble.
“Rix”: Shorn sheep counting-out pens
should be of timber, high enough to make
it impossible for the wildest sheep to
jump out. Once a shearer sees a sheep
escape from his pen he will not be easily
convinced that he has not lost several
others in the same way—a suspicion
which is not conducive to shed harmony.
“A.F.”: “Frank K.” (B. 3/10/’34) says
any farmer can grind phosphate rock on
his farm. Nauru and Ocean Island rock
is as hard as granite, and requires special
and costly machinery to reduce it to
powder. No ordinary mill will touch it.
“In its natural state” (unground) it is not
a fertiliser. If “Frank K.” wants any
more facts about rock phosphate 1 advise
him to write to the British Phosphate
Commission, Melbourne.
“Walkabout”: Cattlemen are joining
the anti-Alsatian protest. The other day
one of the imported tykes, near MaCkay
(N.Q.), mauled and killed an 18-months-
old heifer. Attempts to drive the killer
from the carcass were futile until the
owner prescribed a dose of lead.

THE DUKE’S WIT.
“Perth is chuckling over a flash of wit
from Prince Henry. The Prince is something
of a raconteur, and a couple of stories, alleg-
edly of royal origin, are already going the
rounds of the Perth clubs.”— Sydney “Sun.”
Eloquent testimony of the Duke’s
ability as a raconteur comes from Adel-
“You will be surprised, sir—you’re the father
of quadrupeds!”
aide, where our amiable visitor related an
amusing episode which happened just
prior to his departure for Australia.
It appears that the Duke was week-
ending with the Bishop of , and
boiled eggs were served at breakfast. An
impecunious curate was unfortunate
enough to receive as his portion an egg
which had apparently been overlooked
for some considerable time. Not wishing
to offend his host, he was struggling
manfully with it.
The Bishop remarked “How is your
egg, Mr. Simpkins?” (that being the
curate’s name).
“Well, my lord,” stammered the
curate, “it is—er—good in parts.”
When Prince Henry told this story the
audience was convulsed, and soon the
whole city was helpless with laughter.
Another example of the Duke’s ready
repartee that is causing much amusement
in the clubs related to a punning con-
test that was held one evening on the
Sussex. When thq Duke’s turn came he
was set the word “potato.”
Like a flash the Duke responded: “I
got up potato clock this morning.”’
Uco.
THE PAWNTICKET PHORT.
France, the cable says, is working on
the principle of armor in place of men
“Here you ore, mate!"
and has built a line of frontier forts that
will defy any gun. We seem to have
heard something like that before; but
in the Pawnticket Phoolproof Phorts I
have myself invented something which
will not only defy an enemy but destroy it.
The basic idea is huge rubber de-
fences, air-lined. The enemy’s shells
strike this mass of defensive material
and are knocked back in a double
sense. Each phort is so constructed that
it “gives” sufficiently to take the force
from the projectile’s flight; and then
there is the rebound. The shells, before
they have time to explode, are bounced
back on to the attackers’ lines with disas-
trous results.
The enemy may then decide to take
the position by assault. What happens?
The line of attackers, coming full tilt,
hits the india-rubber fortification with a
bang. It yields ; but only for a moment.
There is an instant rebound and the un-
fortunate men are bounced back on to
the bayonets of their second line. The
second line, going on, is bounced back
in turn. The more lines there are, the
better.
After that, all that is necessary is for
the defenders to send out parties to col-
lect the remnants of the enemy. The
war is over, I collect my royalties, and
everybody is happy.
It will be, so to speak, a triumph for
bounce.

MORE PATHOLOGICAL
RESEARCH.
“Pink Elephantiasis.” —An ailment
peculiar to those constantly handling
“schooners,” though they may not neces-
sarily lead a nautical life. Spots before
the eyes is a common symptom, and when
these disappear more are demanded by
the patient. The duration is variable, but
a big change will be noticed after there is
no more small change. On the morning
following the attack, the patient’s whim
of breakfasting at the chemist’s may be
indulged.
“Calfiovitis.” —One of the developmen-
tal, if not entirely mental, diseases of
male adolescents. The onset is charac-
terised by a goofy feeling under the
collar, temporary loss of speech, palpi-
tation and occasionally facial rubescence.
Loss of appetite is common. If .the
patient is kept in a darkened room his
condition will be found to become much
easier. Symptomatic are the alternating
attacks of cheerfulness and extreme mor-
bidness, while as many as 14 sighs to
•he minute have been noted in serious
cases. If frequent attacks occur with
increasing severity, marriage will effect
an instantaneous cure.

-CUTTING THE RECORD.
A large Brisbane firm recently made a pre-
sentation to two men who, in the words of the
managing director, “have grown grey-haired
during their half-century in the firm’s employ.”
The flapper typist in our office can
beat that record hollow. A brunette to
start with, she’d only been here three
months when we noticed she had grown
brown-haired. Two months later she
grew pale-yellow-haired, and from some-
thing I overheard yesterday I’m willing
to wager that she’ll grow auburn-haired
before the month is out.
And yet there’s no talk of a presenta-
tion. p

The wife wants a new frock for the

I’d like her to get that cotton one we
were looking at; it’s so neat and simple.
But she prefers a more elaborate affair,
made of silk, with flared skirt, new style
sleeves and what-do-you-call-it around
the neck. Of course, she’d look all right
in that one ; still, I prefer the other. It’s
so simple, and simplicity is the keynote
of good taste.
Her friends advise her to get the silk
one. But they’re all wrong. Damn
them! They don’t have to pay for it!

PEEPS AT THE PROFESSIONS.
VIII. —The Engineer.
The Engineer on land and sea
Seems almost a necessity.
The. train won’t to, the ship won’t fro,
Unless he’s there to make ’em go.
Rivals uncertificated
Say his value’s overrated,
Pointing out there’s this about him :
Stone Age men got on without him.
(Envy prompts such murmurings,
For that applies to heaps of things.)
Engineers may be divided into two
main classes —Civil and Uncivil. There
are, of course, engineers who make
things, such as aeroplanes, cigarette-
lighters and mousetraps, or drive things,
like locomotives and merry-go-rounds;
but, speaking generally, these two terms
cover all types.
Uncivil Engineers are subdivided into
Marine, Military and Mining Engineers.
Civil Engineers
are not w e 11-
named. They often
do things which in
anyone else would
be considered most
uncivil.
For instance,
hardly a week
passes without a
Civil Engineer
throwing a bridge
across a river or
pushing a tunnel
through a mountain. It goes without
saying that Civil Engineers are abnor-
mally strong men, or they wouldn’t be
able to do these things, but it seems
rather unfair that they should presume
upon their strength, knowing full well
that there is no one on the other side of
the river capable of throwing the bridge
back, or, beyond the mountain, strong
enough to thrust the tunnel back.
One of these days two rival Civil
Engineers will come face to face across
a river, and will hurl bridges back and
forth at each other until both die from
sheer exhaustion. That’ll teach ’em to
live up to their names!
The Uncivils are also badly named.
Most of them are quite civil. Ask any
girl who has tra-
velled on a luxury
liner for her
opinion of Marine
Engineers and she
will assure you
that they are most
polite. Ask any
stoker and he may
corroborate this.
Marine Eng i-
neers are almost
always Scotsmen.
The few who are
not soon pick up
the language.
Then there is the
Military Engineer.
There is some
doubt as to what
he does, but obvi-
ously no army
would be complete
without him. This
is particularly true
of the Australian
Army. He helps
to swell the num-
bers on parade; and, of course, there’s
the uniform.
The Mining Engineer is in a class of
his own. He has mastered the profes-
sion in all its intricacies. All other
engineers have to be on the spot to do
their work. The Civil Engineer can’t
throw a bridge across a river unless he
has a river to operate on. The Marine
Engineer almost always has a ship to
hold his engines, and even the Military
Engineer does whatever he does under
cover of military organisation.
The Mining Engineer, however, with-
out stirring from his office in Pitt- or
Collins-street, is able to report on mines
as far distant as New Guinea or Cochin
China.
In fact, the more distant the mine the
better he is able to report.

THE EXPLANATION.
The waterworks' flag was at half-mast

And it had us all wondering who’d

dead.”

mant”—all occasionally show signs of activity.
The only large M.L. volcano believed to be
definitely extinct is Egmont. Tarawera and
White Island must be added to the list of
dormant volcanoes.
Melbourne “Herald” recently conducted a
competition in which prizes went to the persons
who most nearly picked the positions 12 foot-
ball learns would occupy at the end of the
season. How many lists would have to be
sent in to ensure getting one right ? —3734.
The number of possible different arrange-
ments of 12 teams is 478,997,600.
I always understood that if fingerprints were
left on a highly-colored article it was found
that when this was photographed the repro-
duction of fingerprint characteristics was not
at all clear and could not be definitely used by
the police. A scientific journal states that this
difficulty has been overcome. Can you tell me
how ?— 3827.
By a method invented by Prof. Henry Brose
and C. G. Winson, of University College, Not-
tingham. They discovered that if a fine powder
of anthracene or phosphorescent zinc sulphide
is sprinkled on the ridge of an imprint on a
highly-colored article and then exposed to dark
ultra-violet rays, the powder retains the ultra-
violet light. It thus becomes phosphorescent,
and when a photograph of the article is taken
the phosphorescent light negatives the highly-
colored background, and the fingerprint ridge
characteristics are clearly reproduced. The
phosphorescent powder has also been found
useful by the English police in the detection of
lorged notes. The phosphorescent ray shows
up certain characteristics in a genuine note
which fail to appear on a forged one.
(1) Can a Maoriiander or resident of the
Solomon Islands enter for the S. H. Prior

Zealand or the British South Pacific islands or
a bona-fide resident of any of these places for
the two years preceding the closing date. (2)

(1) What is the condition of the roads in the
Mandated Territory of New Guinea 3 (2) What
are the houses there, especially those occupied
by new settlers, usually bi/ilt of? —3755.
(1) Roads suitable for vehicular traffic have
been provided mainly in the vicinity of the
larger settled areas,. and, with the exception of
some hundred miles of good road on the east
coast of New Ireland, do not afford access by
vehicles to areas distant from ; the points of
settlement. (2) Usually of sawn timber, obtain-
able from several small sawmillihg plants in
the Territory. Many persons who take up
land for plantation purposes are content, how-
ever, in the first few years to reside in dwell-
ings made of native bush material with roofs
thatched with palm fronds. These • homes’ are
very cool and healthy to live \in, , although
possessing certain disadvantages.
How is ethyl chloride obtained ? What are
its uses ? —3797. -
By passing hydrogen chloride into alcohol in
the presence of anhydrous zinc chloride , and
condensing the product, which passes'over in a
cooled receiver. Ethyl chloride is a colorless,
ethereal liquid, boiling at 12deg. C., which is
soluble in alcohol and only sparingly so in
water. It is used as a local or refrigerating
anaesthetic in dentistry and minor operations,
and also as a general anaesthetic Tn place of
nitrous oxide. .
What form of dramatic art is a' farce 3 Is
it the same as a comedy or burlesque 3—3791.
A farce is defined as. a stage play which makes
no pretence of holding the mirror up to nature,
aiming at exciting laughter by means of absurd
situations and extravagant buffoonery. The
province of comedy is to reveal ~ the humorous
interplay of character upon character, and that
of burlesque is to caricature some particular
fashion, style or human type. r ;
On what date is Dingaan’s Day celebrated
among the Boers in South Africa, and what
does it commemorate 3—3802.
December 16, the anniversary of the decisive
defeat of Dingaan, a' Zulu chief, by a. small
force of Boers under Eretorius in 1838. The
cause of the conflict thus-brought to a close
was the massacring by the Zulus of a party of
Boer settlers.
(1) Books containing reference to the Congo
Basin as regards animal life, type of country
and inhabitants, etc. ? r (2) Could such material
be used in a novel 3—3718.
(1) “Across the Great Craterland to the
Congo,” by T. A. Barns, F.R.G.S., F.R.S.
(E. Benn,'Ltd., London); '“From- the Congo
to the Niger and the Nile,” by the Duke of
Mecklenburg (Duckworth and Co., London);
“George Grenfell and the Congo” (two vols.),
by Sir Harry Johnson, G.C.M.G.. K.C.8., D.Sc.
Cambs. (Hutchinson and Co., London); also
the “Encyclopaedia Britannica,” under
“Congo.” (2) Yes, quite a lot of “local color”
in novels seems to have been obtained from
such sources.
Where can l find some authority for the
statement that the second Pitt sent into France
quantities of forged assignats ? —3691.
In Frankl and Hopkins’s “Romance of the
Bank of England,” published in 1933, it
is stated definitely that “the British Govern-
ment had manufactured a quantity of French
notes called ‘assignats’ (on paper specially
prepared at mills in Durham), and got these
circulated in France with the object of under-
mining French finance.” See also S. E. Harris’s
“The Assignats” (Harvard University Press,
1930). These volumes are in the N.S.W.
Public Library, Sydney.
How to make a lily-pond ? —3820.
Excavate soil to a design (rectangular, square,
oval, round, etc.) and pack in 3in. of concrete.
Cover this with a mixture of two-parts sand
and one-part cement, working it thoroughly into
the base. A final coating of thin cement will
make it fairly leak-proof. Where land is of
a clayey nature add wire-netting for reinforce-
ment with the first mixture. The pool will need
several washings to get the lime out of the
structure. Then place soil in the pool to a
depth of 2ft., set the plants and, finally, slowly
fill with water so that the soil will not be dis-
turbed. Bright-flowering annuals set around
the pool will brighten the surroundings, especi-
ally when the water-plants are not in bloom.
How to rid a lawn of clover and dandelions ?
—3812.
Sprinkle sulphate of ammonia on the clover;
it will probably burn the grass, but the green
sward will revive under regular watering.
Dandelions must be extracted bodily with a
forked lifter, making sure to get the tap-root.
How to propagate thyme? —3799.
By seed sown in shallow boxes covered, with
glass; by. division of the old clumps, using the
young, strong growth; and by layering. Layer-
ing is preferable. For the last-named process,
spread out the old plants, cover with light
loam and water regularly. In four or six weeks’
time dig up the old clump and subdivide, when
the small limbs will be covered with young
fibrous roots.
In a history book I came across the Latin
phrase: “Prceceptum munus annalium reor, tie
virtutes sileantur, utque pravis dictis factisque,
ex postcritate et infamia metus sit.” What is
the English translation and where is it from ?
—3823.
It is from Tacitus’s “Annals,” Book 3, and
reads in English: “1 consider it to be the chief
office of history that the virtuous qualities of
men be not unrecorded, and that evil words and
deeds may incur the fear of posterity and
future ill report.”
What are “essential” oils and what are their
characteristics ? —3BlO.
Oils which possess the odors in a concentrated
form of the plants or vegetable substances from
which they are obtained. These oils are gener-
ally contained in a special gland or cell within
the plant. The essential oils are generally in-
soluble in water, but they dissolve freely in
alcohol, ether or fatty oils. They contain a
large proportion of carbon which causes them
to ignite easily, but as a rule they leave no
permanent grease spot. They possess an aro-
matic smell and a hot 'burning taste, and can
be distilled unchanged.
How to remove warts? —3665.
Isolated warts may be removed with caustics
or by excision, medical supervision being re-
quired in the latter case. Paint simple finger
warts daily with a saturated solution of salicylic
acid in collodion, carefully avoiding the sur-
rounding; skin during treatment. If the growth
persists, substitute glacial acetic acid for a time,
makifig the application with a pointed wooden
match o’f glass rod. Meanwhile, anaemic debility
with lime deficiency in the system demands
attention. Lime-water (one or two tablespoons
in. a- glass of milk) may be taken with meals
twice or thrice daily.
Was a law ever passed in England against the
use of cosmetics ? If so, can you give me a
brief outline of it? —3681.
Yes, in 1770. The Act stipulated: “That all
women ,of whatever age, rank, profession or
degree, whether virgin maid or widow, that
shall from and after such Act impose upon,
seduce and betray into matrimony any of his
Majesty’s subjects by means of scents, paints,
cosmetic washes, artificial teeth, false hair,
Spanish wool, iron stays, hoops, high-heeled
shoes or bolstered hips, shall incur the penalty
of- the law now in force against witchcraft and
like misdemeanors, and that the marriage upon
conviction shall stand hull and void.”
How is the area of a steam ,piston computed
in ‘‘circular inches” ?— 3605.
Multiply the diameter of the piston, in inches,
by itself. For example, if the diameter of the
piston is 6in., the area in circular inches will
be 36, whereas, the area in. sq. in. will be
28.2744. To convert sq. in. into circular in.,
multiply by 1.27324, and to convert circular in.
into sq. in., multiply by 0.7854.
(1) Tool suitable for cutting “blue-metal”
stone? (2) Price, and where obtainable? (3)
Any bo,oks-on this subject? —36o9.
(1) A claw bit and ;holder. (2) 14in. claw
bit and holder, 3s. 9d.; extra bits, 3s. per doz.,
from Nock and Kirby, Sydney. - (J) You should

Purchase, Bs. 3d., Dymock’s, Sydney.
Approximate capacity of water delivered per
hour by a single-acting 3 in. pump, l\in. stroke,
working at 31 strokes per minute? —3sB3.
- 56 cub. ft. per hour, or 349 gallons. A deduc-
tion of from 5 to 15 p.c. should be made
for slip, depending on condition of pump.
Can you recommend “Dr. Annandale’s Con-
cise English' Dictionary” for general use, par-
ticularly in regard <■ to accents and pronuncia-
tions ?. What are the more important features
of this dictionary ? —3654.
,It is- a very good abridged dictionary. The
pronunciation of all words is given phonetically,
even to the declensions of each word, and the
quantities of the vowels are shown clearly and
simply. The supplement includes notable names
in fiction, mythology, etc.; a pronouncing
vocabulary of Greek, Latin, Scriptural and
other ancient names; a pronouncing vocabu-
lary of modern geographical names; a select
pronouncing list of modern biographical names,
and other useful references. .

THE PALETTE
One of the most interesting collections
of etchings by Australians got together
in recent years is on show at the Lawson
Gallery, Sydney. Sydney Long is at his
best in “The Lake, Avoca” and “The
Deserted Selection,” and shows also three
very effective aquatints. The graceful
line of Douglas Pratt delineates glimpses
of Sydney and other parts of N. S. Wales.
J. B. Gordon’s sound architectural draw-
ing is exemplified in “Burdekin House”
and “Towers of St. Andrew’s,” and his
“Old Timers, Berry’s Bay” is well com-
posed. Squire Morgan and Bruce
Robertson are represented by some of
the best of their work.
A so-called “collective” exhibition
of pictures at the Fine Arts, Mel-
bourne, isn’t collective but segrega-
tive. There are four groups or schools,
and they have each been separated from
the others. In the modernists’ bay Grace
Crowley has applied the cubist method to
architecture, and Rah Fizelle has done
the same to human beings, with the
result that the buildings look as if they
were made of cardboard and the human
beings look as if they were made of con-
crete. The academicians are in the middle,
and include a brittle nude by Charles
Wheeler which made present critic feel
suddenly in sympathy with the concrete-
mixers. The Meldrum group includes a
serene self-portrait by Meldrum, a still-
life by Justus Jorgensen and some Euro-
pean landscapes which should be a
lesson to the modernists, for they are
strange without striving to be strange.
Norman Lindsay, who monopolises the
fourth subdivision, illustrates this fact
in “Love,” a large pen-and-ink draw-
ing. Lindsay’s facility has here been
employed to state a biological or
psychological truth which, however,
has been more accurately and exhaus-
tively defined by Freud and D. H. Law-
rence. This, in fact, is the only valid
criticism that can be brought against the
art of Norman Lindsay, and not the
moral one which has been used by Mel-
bourne critics.
Vic. Artists’ Society has opened its
spring chamber of horrors and beautie:
at Albert-street, the horror being out of
all proportion to the beauty. “Blossom
and the Old Barn,” by Norah Gur-
don, and “Inverloch Blue,” by Aileen
Dent, have some charm about them.
W. A. Dargie is represented by
portraits in which the sitters don’t
look in need of artificial respiration,
and the “Dr. Julian Smith” of W. B.
Mclnnes is a good likeness, though lack-
ing the atmospheric qualities of the
artist’s best work. There are space and
airiness in John Rowell’s “The Little
Silo,” and W. Lister Lister captures some
of the glitter of light on leaves in “The
Shadow Across the Path.” Syd Long’s
familiar romanticism is unvaried in
“Narracan Landscape,” and hot light is
manifest in Dora Serle’s “Pear Tree.”
W. A. Dargie’s “Nude” is the best in
the exhibition ; in fact, it is either the
only one or the writer has forgotten the
others or only thought of paint instead
of human beings in looking at them. In
“The Mishap at the Devil’s Kitchen, Bal-
larat,” Alan T. Barnardo depicts a rider
shielding his eyes from the spectacle of
a team of gallant horses going over a
precipice ; but he lacks the skill to give
us the emotion of the spectator of the
tragedy. Most of the other exhibits are
like the speeches of orators who start
talking before they know what they in-
tend to say.
Leslie Wilkie, director of Adelaide Art
Gallery, has brought back from his Cen-
tralian expedition with the scientists a
batch of half-length oil paintings of
natives. Though necessarily quick
studies, they have all the smooth ’finish
of the old-timer, yet are no less life-like
than the work of the modernists. The
versatile Michael O’Connell has at
Preece’s gallery, Adelaide, a show of linen
fabrics, colored and hand-stamped with
his highly original designs. The human
figures are borrowed from nightmare,
and the present critic likes him best when
he either imitates a Greek frieze or is
content with a mere pattern on Indian
lines. His is the kind of work which
makes '’omen enthusiastic but leaves
men cold.

EMERGENCY MEASURES.
CORRECT ACTION IN A CRISIS.
BY FRED BERRY.
UNDER normal driving conditions and provided' everything
goes well, the modern car can be driven safely by the
average schoolboy, but as both machine and driver are fallible
the time may come when, due either to some mechanical defect
or a human error inside or outside the car, skill and resource
will be demanded if disaster is to be avoided.
Only long experience at the wheel enables fivers to act
by instinct in such circumstances, but a few words of advice to
the novice and those of moderate experience may be helpful.
Fully 90 per cent, of driving emergen-
cies are avoidable and directly under the
control of the individual concerned. Even
under the most favorable conditions, a
driver should not relax from a subcon-
scious vigilance. The steering-wheel must
always be held in the correct manner,
loosely, but in such a way that instant
and positive control is assured in the
event of a burst tyre, steering derange-
ment or skid, and a keen lookout must
be kept the whole time the car is in
motion.
Skids of one sort or another are pos-
sibly the most common mishaps to be
Why cornering at speed leads to accidents. Note car
travelling “slow” (right), steering wheels following curve
exactly. Steering centre of fast car (left) departs from centre

met with while driving, and in this con-
nection it may be said that' the condition
of the tyre equipment has an important
bearing upon both the cause and result
of the skid. The man who incautiously
drives with smooth tyres, devoid of pat-
tern on the tread, especially upon greasy
roads, is surely asking for trouble.
Further, the more worn the tyre the more
difficult will be the driver’s task in cor-
recting a skid.
Fortunately, the rear of the car skids
more frequently than does the front, but,
even so, it is almost certain that the
novice driver will get the wind up the
first time he is called upon to correct the
trouble. Provided, however, he acts in-
stantly and steers in the direction of the
skid, he need not fear an accident, and a
little deliberate practice will soon teach
him just how much wheel to give and,
what is equally important, when to let it
back in this emergency.
Skid Control.
In steering into a skid we will assume
that the car is travelling along and, due to
the greasy condition of the road, the rear
portion of the car makes a sudden dive
tor the left ditch. As soon as this motion
is felt the front wheels must be turned
left, towards the gutter, and the quicker
this is done the sooner will the skid be
corrected.
Front-wheel skids are, fortunately,
rarely met with, and there is no situation
short of a broken steering connection
which leaves the driver so utterly help-
less. Should, however, it ever fall to your
lot to handle one of these fearsome and
hair-raising skids, let go the four-wheel
set of brakes and slam on the rear set
(usually the hand brake) with all your
might, for all that can helpfully be done is
to reduce speed with the greatest possible
dispatch. While this is going on, the
steering-wheel must be centralised and
moved gently a few
degrees only from
one side to the
other until you feel
(with the utmost re-
lief) that you have
caught the steering
again and the car
is in control.
Remember ever
afterwards that the
mere fact of hav-
ing developed the
front-wheel skid
proves you had
driven too fast for
the condition of the
tyres and the road
at that particular
time, and that you
were entirely to
blame for the mis-
hap.
Safe Braking.
While on the subject of brakes it will
be of interest to motorists to learn that
they can be of great assistance in reduc-
ing recoil after striking an unexpected
bump or ditch in the roadway. Many a
driver on meeting an obstruction of this
nature has simply shut his teeth, hung
grimly to the wheel, and taken what was
coming, to the ill content of the rear
passengers and at the risk of breaking
sundry springs. When this situation arises
again, just as the rear wheels are about
to strike the obstacle jamb the brakes on
fiercely for an instant and release them
again as soon as the object is passed.
Naturally one cannot expect to get past
without a considerable thump, but the
line of action indicated may mean the
difference between merely a good shak-
ing up and a broken skull for one of
the rear passengers.
Perchance it may come your way to
be forced to drive over some living object,
and you should be conversant with the
correct method of manipulating the
brakes in this emergency. The natural
instinct of a driver is to apply the brakes
fiercely in an effort to pull up in the
shortest possible distance. This plan is
wrong. Immediately the object has
reached the wheels all brakes must be
freed in order that the car may roll
smoothly. With the wheels locked or
braking fiercely anything between the
tyres and the road will be dragged along
and mangled, \vhile with the brakes oft
the wheel load alone is supported.
Many motorists can call to mind hav-
ing passed over snakes basking on the
road, only to see them scurry to the bush,
apparently unharmed. Next time the
opportunity presents itself, apply the
brakes vigorously as you pass over the
wriggler, and see what a good snake you
make of him.
Out of Control.
The possibility of a car bolting during
the descent of a steep hill is a perpetual
source of anxiety to the nervous driver,
MOTORIMPRESSIONS —1914 MODEL
with the result that touring is robbed of
much of its charm. Almost every acci-
dent of this nature can be traced to either
gross carelessness or overconfidence, for,
provided the driver takes the simple pre-
caution of engaging second gear at the
hilltop, there is but a remote chance of
any trouble on the way down.
The nervous driver should know that
even should the car get out of control on
the way down prompt action will in-
variably save a severe smash. As soon as
the driver feels the car getting away—
perhaps the brakes are very wet or have
failed —he must instantly try for a lower
gear. Release the clutch, roar up the
engine, and slam the gear lever into the
next low position. No half measures, for
you have only one chance of recovery.
Should this plan fail, make straight
for the nearest bank; but there is a right
and a wrong way even to take this dras-
tic step. Don’t ram the car head first
into the wall, but just before striking
swerve slightly away so that the machine
skids and the whole side takes a glancing
blow. This will mean that fenders and
footboards take the shock and crumple
up gradually without doing extensive
damage to the chassis or exposing the
passengers to much risk.
Free-wheeling.
In cases where drivers are operating
cars equipped with free-wheeling units
there is a further and extremely rapid de-
cision to be made. Obviously when free-
wheeling is in use no retarding influence
of the engine is possible, and as the suc-
cess of the foregoing instructions depends
almost' wholly upon using the motor in
this manner drivers of modern cars must
press firmly on the accelerator pedal, and
pull the free-wheel control into “conven-
tional” drive before putting into effect the
measures set out in handling a bolting car.
It should, however, be mentioned that
one of the outstanding advantages of
free-wheeling equipment is that even in
this supposed emergency the gear lever
can be placed into low-speed position
before restoring control to “conventional”
drive, the only preliminary necessary
being to advise passengers to hang on
while the change-over is made.
When a Limousine Is Not a Sedan.
Very few motorists have more than
a passing knowledge of body styles or
names as applied to modern cars, being
content to group them under the three
general headings of sedans, tourers and
roadsters.
In the early days of motoring manu-
facturers were more concerned about
making the mechanical end of the busi-
ness a success than with passenger com-
fort or body style, and as a consequence
the “dogcart” body was the order of the
day. As progress was made mechani-
cally, customers demanded various new
body styles, and the limousine, coupe,
saloon, brougham and others were de-
veloped.
So confusing became the use of these
terms that the British Engineering Stand-
ards Bureau got busy and set down a
standard for future reference.
The limousine and brougham are dis-
tinct from sedans in that they are in-
tended to be chauffeur-driven, being
equipped with a partition between pas-
sengers and driver. The limousine has
a window at the rear of the back doors
—that is, four windows in the rear com-
partment, while the brougham has only
two. The sedan, intended to be owner-
driven, may have two or four doors and
four or six windows, and has no parti-
tion between driver and passengers.
The coupe, a two-seater body, has a
fixed roof, wholly enclosed, and two
doors, and usually a rumble seat at the
rear for spare passengers or luggage.
Few cabriolet bodies are seen in Aus-
tralia. In this type of totally enclosed

Motor Oddities.
“Lignum”: In France in 1917 I saw
a motor-car built by Panhard-Levassor.
A priest owned and drove it, and it had
been in the possession of his family
since 1897. The makers, so the owner
informed us, kept the car in good
repair free of charge; in fact, so great
was their interest in this machine, which
was the sole survivor of the cars made
by them in the nineteenth century, that
they were prepared to exchange it for
a new model at any lime. Recently I
saw an account of this identical vehicle
taking first prize at Olympia for the
oldest and best-conditioned car, so
apparently Panhard-Levassor had suc-
ceeded in making the swap, and this old-
stager is now having a well-earned rest in
their museum.

“Kripple”: The most elaborate and
effective radiator I have seen used with
a motor-engine was one rigged up by a
shearing expert at Maneroo station
(C.Q.). Drought had brought about a
breakdown in the water-supply for the
steam-plant, and a car-engine was set
up on a wooden frame alongside the
boiler, which was used as a radiator by
connecting the blow-off cock to the
motor and back by pump-circulation
through an opened safety-valve. The

at an even suitable temperature through-
out the shearing without a drop having

“G.F.D”: We were speeding along the
Moonie-road (s.-w. Queensland) t’other
day when there occurred a terrific crash.
Sun-visor and windscreen were smashed
to bits. We pulled up as soon as
possible, thinking the war had started
again. Attracted by a noise we looked
overhead, and saw a large eaglehawk
rapidly gaining height; on investigating
further, we found a rabbit minus his
head on the running-board of the car.
The hawk must have been enjoying his
lunch on a dead box-tree leaning over
the road when we disturbed him.
How Driving Methods Affect Tyre
Economy.
The average motorist fails to appre-
ciate the tremendous influence of care-
ful driving upon the effective life of
his tyres. Variations in driving methods
largely account for the wide differences
in mileage obtained when using the same
model car and the same make of tyre.
Owner-drivers who habitually obtain
high tyre mileage will readily believe the
above statement, but it is not so easy
to convince the man who fails to obtain
the consistent big mileage that his friends
get that the trouble lies with his driving.
In this connection an interesting test
was recently carried out overseas by the
Dunlop Co. Thirty drivers were put in
charge of 30 cars of the same model,
fitted with the same make and size of
tyres, and all set to drive over the same
route in the same driving time. The 10
best drivers obtained an average of
20,231 miles out of their tyres, as con-
trasted with the average of 10,773 miles
by the 10 hardest drivers. The 10 medium
drivers averaged 14,958 miles. Of the
30 cars in test, five drivers obtained only
from 7200 to 9400 miles from their
tyres, seven ranged from 11,800 to
13,700 miles, another seven got from
14,300 to 15,800 miles, while six got from
16,100 to 18,700 miles and five obtained
from 20,700 to 27,600 miles. The varia-
tions were not caused by faults in the
tyres, but faults in driving.
Rough braking, rapid acceleration, bad
cornering, unskilful use of clutch, non-
avoidance of stones, ruts, etc., all con-
tributed towards the results.
New Process for Rejuvenating Old
Motors.
Owners of older-model cars, particu-
larly those fitted with a low-compression
type of cylinder head, will be interested
to learn that, due to research carried out
by one H. Weslake, of Twickenham
(Eng.), it is now possible to considerably

bought because people want them in their
homes..

Metal snravintr is not new to this coun-
rneiai spraying is not new io inis euuu

consists of passing a wire of either alu-

minium tin zinc or whatever metal is
to be used through a special pistol, which
melts the wire by oxy-acetylene flame
and delivers it in the form of Spray to
the surface to be coated. This coating
is high y resistant to mechanical wear,
and will not flake or crack. By using
aluminium inside a cast-iron cylinder
head greater thermal efficiency is Ob-
mined by reflecting and radiating back
into each fresh charge of gas heat which
would otherwise be dissipated by passing
through the metal head into the cooling
water.
The effect is quite different from that
when an aluminium cylinder head is
used, for in such cases the advantage
secured is solely a matter of high heat
conductivity, permitting extremely high
compression pressures to be used with-
out knocking or detonation.
Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom centre in
technical or abstract features, but rather in personal experiences or
achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over specified
routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the present mechanical
condition of cars after years of use are matters of extreme interest. Huge
annual mileages, old driving licenses, and perhaps low car numbers support
claims to experience, while many drivers, with characteristic Australian
ingenuity, have made interesting emergency repairs.
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver covers the
greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been confined to
racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic, hundreds of miles from
repair shops, has worked miracles in order to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to' “The Bulletin” and recount their
experiences.

TUNED AERIAL INPUT FOR SHORT
WAVES.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
To obtain the utmost possible signal strength in short-wave reception the
aerial system should be tuned either completely or approximately to the
frequency covered by the tuned circuits at signal frequency in
the receiver. Even a high and well-insulated external aerial system is
relatively inefficient if untuned.
Though the principle to be dealt with
could be applied equally well to normal
broadcast reception it is of vital import-
ance for the short waves. More and
more people are listening on the short-
wave channels used for international
broadcasting. Many are enjoying good
results, and the overseas stations during
signal peak periods are heard quite well.
Fig. 1.—lllustrating the arrangement of
the doublet with transposed feeders. For
general short-wave use, responsive at the
frequencies mostly used, A1 and A2
should each be 35 feet long, with feeders
71 feet long. Alternatively the feeder line
can be of twisted insulated wire.
(See text.)
Other listeners are not so fortunate, and
fall into a class by themselves, dis-
appointed with the offerings of the short
Fig. 2.-The aerial tuning and coupling method used by the
writer. An old plug-in honeycomb coilholder with small
spiderweb coils comprises L3 and L2, with variable coupling.
L1 and L2 are fixtures, L and L3 being the coils changed for
various bands.
waves and under the impression that the
business of searching the dials is a waste
of time. They should not lose heart.
Assuming that the receiver is not at fault,
there is the human element. Tuition in
the ways of receivers and the vagaries of
short waves can rectify this failing.
Next comes the aerial. Is this really
a good aerial for the purpose, or is it
just a piece of wire doing practically
nothing? Many listeners obtaining fairly
satisfactory reception are unaware of it,
but the results obtained may be due solely
to a good receiving location, where the
signal is not absorbed by masses of metal
in surrounding buildings, and the aerial,
'although external, is merely “shock ex-
citing” the receiver. It is a conductor
of minute signal energy to the receiver,
but that is all. If it is an oscillator at the
signal frequency in addition to a con-
ductor, it tells a very different story in
the raising of weak signals above the ruck
of background noise, and there are back-
ground noises in 99 out of 100 locations.
The writer has recently tested thor-
oughly the difference between short-
wave receiving aerials tuned to the re-
quired frequency and the usual “any
old length” single wire untuned systems,
and the results obtained with the tuned
systems must be heard to be realised.
The difference in reception is remark-
able. Those seriously interested in con-
sistently effective short-wave broadcast
reception will do well to digest the fol-
lowing details.
Doublet Aerials Give Improved
Reception Results.
The ideal aerial is one which will pick
up maximum signal voltage with a mini-
mum of electrical noise and interference.
To achieve this, both the aerial proper
and the lead-in need special considera-
tion and treatment. The lead-in does its
work best when it is simply a transmis-
sion line and is so designed that it is in-
capable of picking up local electrical im-
pulses. The aerial itself should be the
only collector of energy. Most of the
electrical interference originates fairly
close to the ground, so that the collector
should be placed as high as possible, and
the earth connection dispensed with en-
tirely. Fig. 1 shows the arrangement
of the doublet type of aerial with trans-
posed feeder line. The aerial itself con-
sists of the two sides, A 1 and A 2, which
are of a predetermined length, accord-
ing to frequencies desired. The length
of A 1 and A 2 for an all-round system
suitable for general use should be 35ft.,
with the feeders 71ft. long. Every two
feet the feeders are crossed over, held
clear of each other by transposition
blocks as shown.
No manufacturer has yet produced
these blocks in Australia, though the
writer has suggested the need for them
repeatedly. They can be made from
hardwood, boiled in paraffin wax.
Dimensions are 2in. by of fin. or
wood. Slots are cut at an angle as
illustrated so that the feeder wires will
grip at the cross-
over and the blocks
remain securely in
position when the
feeders are pulled
tight. In no cir-
cumstances should
dubious insulating
material be used.
Fibre is out of the
question, sheet
bakelite is risky
(unless it’s the real
stuff) and hard
rubber will de-
velop surface leak-
age and deteriorate
with exposure.
Isolantite is the
best of all, but
blocks of this ma-
terial are to be
seen and studied
wistfully only in the advertising pages of
overseas radio journals.
The writer adopted a simple substitute
for transposition blocks, and, although in
theory it is not so good, in practice there
is no difference or loss noticeable. This
is the twisted feeder method. Twisted
lighting flex will not do. After a little
exposure to the weather, the rubber in-
sulation, covered only by cotton, per-
ishes, and heavy leakage and shorting
takes place. If, however, lighting cable
for outside wiring is used, there will be
little fear of trouble for a long time. No.
14 V.I.R. wire has been used success-
fully, twisted evenly by stretching the
two wires out, secured at one end, plac-
ing the other ends in the chuck of a
hand-drill, and twisting them together in
a matter of seconds. The writer uses
doublet aerials fed thus for transmission,
with feeders carrying over an ampere
of R.F. current, without leakage. What
is good for transmission is good for re-
ception.
The crossing-over of the wires by twist-
ing is even more effective than using
blocks, as the number of blocks in a line
is necessarily limited. The advantage of
blocks is that bare instead of insulated
wire can be used.
Coupling to the Receiver.
Though the writer has found a twisted
feeder doublet to be an effective noise-
reducer and signal-raiser by connecting
one feeder to the aerial terminal and the
other to earth (no actual earth used), far
better results are obtained with a pro-
perly designed coupling. The receiver
using a small series capacity direct to
the grid circuit of the R.F. or detector
stage should be altered to use an aerial
coupling coil. The feeders are connected
to this with marked improvement.
Tunmg the System.
In early radio days experimental
broadcast receivers used two- or three-
coil plug-in arrangements with variable
coupling for the aerial coil. The aerial
was invariably tuned. To-day any
such arrangement would only satisfy
the keen experimenter, but a modi-
fied type of such a coupling could

The two sockets are for the doublet connections. One rotor plate of the
variable condenser is bent slightly to short the condenser at full capacity.
undoubtedly be worked into modern re-
ceivers. With short waves the benefit of
aerial tuning is much more marked than
on waves between 200 and 600 metres.
With the feeder line connected to the
aerial coupling coil tuning can be done
by including a series variable condenser
debtor^and e nTR V F sta S S e an reson-
ance B in the aerM circuit with the grid
circuit will prevent the detector from
oscillating, unless the coupling is very
loose. Fig. 2 shows how the coupling
is arranged to overcome this trouble, with
Figs. 3 and 4 showing the scheme in use
on the actual receiver. The receiver is
the writer’s Wide-World Two, modified
especially for amateur-band work. The
coil L is the detector grid coil, wound on
a four-pin former. LI is arranged per-
manently in position so that L plugs
through it into the coil mounting. LI
has four turns of 26 D.S.C. on a 2in.
diameter former. On the side of the re-
ceiver is an old-fashioned two-coil plug-
jn honeycomb-type holder. L 2 is perma-
nent, and is made in the form of a small
spiderweb fitted with pin and socket, and
is l|in. diameter with five turns of 26
D.S.C. This coil is connected to LI, and
the link between may be any convenient
length.
L 3 is the movable aerial coil, like L 2

to suit the complete range from 10 to

turns, the next seven turns and the largest

D. B. KNOCK.
RADIO AND UPLIFT.
A Maoriland university professor who
returned to his home in Dunedin recently
after a sabbatical holiday abroad told
an interviewer that he found England
and Scotland completely transformed.
The whole intellectual and cultural tone
of the people had been raised ; men with
whom he did not expect culture to be
associated spoke quite freely of the works
of the great masters in literature and
music. The whole nation had been sub-
jected to a great educative influence.
This professor is a Scot. Before he
went to Maoriland he taught history at
Aberdeen University, where he had
gained his D.Litt. Moreover, for many
years he has lived in Otago, which is
Scotcher than Scotland, and more seri-
ous-minded. All Maorilanders regard
Australians in very much the same light
as the English see the light-hearted Gaul.
Otago considers the remainder of the
Dominion flighty and frivolous. When
words come from Otago, and, moreover,
from a professor in that province’s uni-
versity, Australasia can safely bet that
they have been weighed meticulously. .
It is safe to assume, therefore, that
the learned doctor had good reason for
his statement that something wonderful
and ennobling has happened to Blighty.
That marvellous something, he says, is
radio! It becomes a public duty to dis-
cover why broadcasting should so purify
the soul and elevate the intellect in Great
Britain, while in Australia (and presum-
ably also in Maoriland) it has had no
effect of the sort worth writing home
to mother about.
Of course, it is just possible that the
assumption that all we antipodeans have
escaped being improved by radio may
be incorrect. It may be that in univer-
sity circles the leaven has been felt; that
lecturers in mathematics no longer let
their talents stray into computations of
what will win the Epsom and that a pro-
fessor of geology or two have been weaned
from foxtrotting and bridge. But the
great seats of learning (the universities,
not the stouter professors, are meant)
have lost the common touch—they are a
cloistered world apart.
For the rest of us, with all the good-
will in the world towards one’s fellow-
men, could any truthful person say that
in the 10 or 11 years we Australians have
been exposed to broadcasting we have
profited intellectually or spiritually?
Nay, nay. But in England and in Scot-
land (also possibly in Wales and in Ire-
land) the people climb from height to
height. Why?
An attempt to wrest the secret from
the available annals of the 8.8. C., which
controls all broadcasting in G. 8., yields
not very informative results. The tone
of 8.8. C. programmes is almost uni-
formly high, but not higher than those
of the A.B.C. In the matter of conscious
attempts to educate and elevate by means
of talks, lectures and commentaries, the
A. seems to have it all over the
B. in range of subjects and number
of speakers. In Australia the national
stations devote less of their programmes
to music than does the 8.8. C. The Brit-
ish Commission’s weekly flood of music
—almost all highbrow and with a big
percentage of ultra-modern and even
futuristic compositions—is awe-inspiring.
The average Australian owner of a radio
receiver would feel like selling it if he
took it to London, after one glance at
the “Radio Times.” But the English and
the Scotch lap up this enormous stream
of music, and ask for more. The Welsh
seem to be catered for-by special pro-
grammes of their own music printed in
their own language, which, doubtless,
they lap up—sweet little things such as
“Ewch a mi’n 61 i’r dolydd” and “Cen-
wych y Clychan,” inspired by which they
march from strength to strength.
The B;B.C. caters, so its sponsors say,
for “the best in the English mind,” but
Mr. Cleary and Major Conder and the
other grave seigniors who run the A.B.C.
can put their hands on their hearts and
sincerely swear that they are doing all
that in them lies for the Australian mind.
Why don’t their efforts do us more good?
Can it be that there is a Gresham’s law
in radio as in currency, and that base
stuff edges out superior? We have as
good a national broadcasting service as
Britain has in all that matters for the
purposes of this comparison, but we have
also a multiplicity of commercial stations
not always concerned with what is best
in any sort of mind. We could stand a
bit of improving—there’s no nation that
couldn’t —and if the advertising of chew-
ing-gum and face-cream is shutting us off
from uplift—well, it would be hard to
lose “Tarzan,” but something will have
to be done about it.

Amateur Chatter.
Nations would surely do well to
pay more attention to the international
aspect of amateur radio communication.
Though a U.S.A. general declares that
Japan is America’s greatest danger,
numbers of U.S.A. amateurs on the
7mc. band are nightly calling and work-
ing Japanese stations in typically friendly
amateur manner. The League of Nations
should recognise that amateur communi-
cation is a powerful antidote to war talk.
Delegates to the League should impress
on all nations the advisability of giving
the amateur wider frequency bands and
better facilities for his overseas hand-
shaking of fellow-men. Radio amateurs
are mostly enthusiastic youngsters, and
our present young men will be the future
rulers of the world.
The most terrific electrical storm re-
corded for years hit Sydney on Sunday
evening, 30/9/’34, and wise people
earthed their aerials and quit the shack.
Writer had just finished erecting three
doublets, apd couldn’t complete earthing
arrangements quickly enough, when the
first hefty discharge took place in the
near vicinity. Static was audible for
hours previously on 28mc. —a sure sign
that something was cooking up in the
sky.
DX has been good on 7mc. In the
early morn, 5 a.m. to 7 a.m., Europeans
are romping in, and sundry weird ’phones
in queer languages may be heard
strongly. The Englishmen’s description
of French amateur ’phones as “spitch”
is well realised upon hearing the bedlam.
Writer was hailed by G2ZQ in Black-
heath, South London, and pleasantly
surprised to find that Jack Scott, ex-
VK2NR, of Sydney, was at the key.
VQ4CRL, of Nairobi, Kenya, was also
hooked. VK2XO, Bellingen, North
Coast, N.S.W., who normally lives on
3.5mc., is called nightly by U.S.A. ama-
teurs on 7mc. Skip prevents 2XO from
being heard in Sydney after dark on
7mc.
A brief chat with FM4AA, in Tunis,
North Africa, elicited the information
that VK’s are coming through well there,
despite the European QRM medley. It cuts
both ways, for in the afternoon in Aus-
tralia, although a few Europeans may be
heard strongly on 7mc., they are mostly
blotted out by Americans and local QRM.
The Spaniards appear to put the most
consistently strong signals over, morning
and afternoon. Some activity on 28mc.
should be forthcoming now that the 12
months’ R.S.G.B. test has started, but, so
far, silence, except for locals and har-
monics. Meanwhile, the 14mc. midnight
Australia-England channel is anxiously
awaited,' and, according to previous
years, signals should show up at any
time now. UIXU, near Vladivostok,
U.S.S.R., is putting a strong signal into
Sydney on 7mc. around 8 p.m., S.M.T.,
but the note is I.C.W. hash, and not easy
to read. He says some VK’s are strong
there. VPIZZ, at Labasa Radio, Fiji,
reports on every VK heard, and says that
the telephony from VK’s 4JB and 4JU
is a pleasure to listen to out there. As
for ZL’s, the way they work anywhere
with anything shows that Maoriland is
undoubtedly the DX paradise.
Frank Lambert, VK6FL, of Albany,
W.A., has a strong, peculiar signal in
Sydney nightly on 7mc. The character-
istic note is due to a rotary converter
from D.C. supply.
With the Melbourne centenary con-
test in full swing, overseas stations of all
descriptions may be sorted out of the
medley. 14mc. has shown up well.
VK2YT was heard in touch with U9AF
around 9 p.m. G2VQ was heard strongly
at 9.30 p.m., also OA4G ; and OH3NP
Finland was worked. On 9/10/’34,
VK2HZ visited writer’s station ; and a
remarkable number of American first dis-
trict stations were heard, and some
worked, on 14mc. between 9.30 and
10.30 p.m., S.M.T. Unusual for this
band at night.

What’s What in Radio
Reported from San Francisco that a
rancher possesses the unique gift of being
able to hear broadcasting without any
of the usual apparatus, due apparently
to some trait of his nervous system. In
view of the recent discovery that the
human brain has a definite wave-length
response in the region of 3,000,000
metres, this may be an instance where
nature forgot to add four noughts, with
the result that the brain frequency is in
proximity to the wave-lengths used for
broadcasting, 200 to 600 metres.

Until the Duke of Gloucester leaves
Australia for Maoriland on December
10, the B-class broadcasting stations will
be radiating descriptive accounts of every
function associated with his visit. A
series of link-ups of all B-class stations
has been arranged, so that listeners every-
where will be able to tune in to their own
local station, whether the broadcast is
coming from Adelaide, Melbourne, Can-
berra, Sydney or Brisbane. The network
thus constituted will be the most compre-
hensive yet organised, involving the use
of thousands of miles of telephone lines
every time the various stations are con-
nected. The B stations for once in a
way have pooled their resources. An-
nouncers and commentators will be
heard over stations with which ordinarily
they are in rivalry.

American listeners recently heard the
graphic broadcast of the stratosphere-
balloon ascent from Rapid City, South
Dakota, when three army officers tried
to reach a height of 15 miles. As the
balloon was radio-equipped, listeners
heard a description commencing with
suspected trouble, leading to the ripping
of the balloon envelope and culminating
in the jumping of the occupants to safety
by parachute. The expensively-equipped
gondola crashed to earth, completely
wrecking all the valuable instruments,
save a spectroscope which was suspended
by its own small parachute.

Have you yet described a superhet con-
verter with amateur bandspread and C.W.
beat oscillator, A.C. operated? —l4B.
No, but the converters described in B. I /8/’34
need only a bandspread condenser of four or
five plates in parallel with the oscillator gang
section for this purpose. The C.W. beat oscil-
lator is impracticable in a converter, as the
beat is arranged in a short-wave superhet in
conjunction with the second detector. The
broadcast receiver with which the converter
is to be used could be easily adapted thus.
An all-wave superhet with regeneration for
C.W. will be described in a week or two.
(1) Can / use a Ferranti AFS audio trans-
former as a push-pull transformer by connect-

to form an electrical centre-tap ? (2) When an
output meter is connected to an output valve,
for example a 45, does this mean that the
secondary is connected between P and B maxi-

described ? —149.
(1) This method of using an ordinary trans-
former for push-pull is workable, but it is
better to use variable resistors in order to
obtain a careful balance of the secondary. (2)
Cannot quite get your meaning. The coup-
ling transformer in the output meter is a pro-
tection. The primary connects directly across
the speaker transformer primary in any case.
(3) .0005 mfd. is correct. The capacity was
omitted from the circuit diagram.

Advice is required on the choice of a small
battery headphone receiver for all-wave work.
I am prepared to put it together myself, and
have considered a one-valve arrangement much
advertised. As the receiver is for Central
Queensland, l feel that more than one valve
is necessary for good results. What do you
suggest ? —152.
The best receiver for you in the circumstances
is the Wide-World Two (B. 15/8/’34). This
uses modern 6.3-volt indirectly-heated valves,
and suits you, as you intend to use a 6-volt
accumulator to be charged from a car gene-
rator. Cohen and Burrows, Royal Arcade,
Sydney, specialise in kits of parts, or complete
receivers. A single-valve affair would be a
sheer waste of time.
/ am using a four-valve superhet, with 57,
57, 57 and 47 valves, and Magnavox 2500-
ohm speaker. It is desired to use headphones
alternatively with this receiver. How can this
be done ? / have 4000 -ohm headphones and
an output transformer with various ratios.
This transformer is rated to carry no more
than 20 milliamperes D.C. current. —-154.
Normally, the output transformer cannot be
used, and the easiest way of using headphones
is by using the primary of the input transformer
to the speaker as the audio choke, and a 1-
or 2-mfd. capacity condenser for choke-capa-
city coupling the ’phones. A volume control
can be connected across the ’phones. One
side of the ’phones will connect to the con-
denser and the other to the chassis, or B
negative.
My receiver is an Astor 6-valve neutrodyne
using Philips A 609 valves throughout. Would
much alteration be necessary to use screen-
grid valves in the R.F. stages, and would there
be much advantage ? —156.
Provision would have to be made for screen-
grid voltage and complete screening of the
individual tuned circuits. Philips A642's could
be used with advantage, these having a higher
amplification factor than the A6o9’s. The
alteration would be advantageous if done cor-
rectly.

THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
“Hopeless, Broken Men”
I met one of them last week in Mac-
quarie-place, Sydney. His careworn face
would have drawn pity from a Sphinx.
He had a shirt, but no singlet; shoes,
but no socks —and the shoes were holed
through to the ground. He was work-
less and hungry.
I could only satisfy his immediate need
for food, but as I gave him my small
coin it occurred to me that he had had
no difficulty in finding a job on Anzac
morning, 1915, or another at Lone Pine.
And he had three years’ constant work
in France. Men like this broken Anzac
memorial saved us. Did we deserve to
be saved?— Ezekiel (N.S.W.).
Diggers on the Track
This sub-branch of the Returned
Soldiers and Sailors recently made a
move with the object of bettering the
lot of the Digger on the track. Our
objective is to obtain food and clothing,
at the expense of the Government, for
every Digger travelling the country in
search of work. At present various sub-
branches bear this expense, handing out'
thousands of pounds’ worth of food and
clothing yearly to necessitous and deserv-;
ing cases.
Our sub-branch is of opinion that the
production of a soldier’s discharge should
be sufficient to enable him to obtain sus-
tenance at any town on the track. The
work of judging individual cases and
of issuing food and clothing could be
undertaken by the police, or it could
be placed under the control of sub-
branches. We care not through what
channel our object is attained as long as
the Diggers wandering the country in
search of work are assured of food and
clothing from the country for which they
fought.—For Darlington Point (N.S.W.)

High Speeds on Curves
Allow me to return “Puff-Puff” (B.
26/9/’34) to the rails. Any train will
roll if it has to follow a snaky course ;
and it has to on the Sydney-Newcastle
section. So he can hardly blame the
department for that. As far as safety
goes, how many accidents have occurred
in N.S.W. on account of high speeds on
curves?
Chairs are not necessary. They are not
used in the U.S.A. or Canada ; and . as
for eliminating hazardous curves it can’t
be done. Not on Hawkesbury Bank
anyway. Such curves are covered by
speed restrictions. I’d like “Puff-Puff”
to show me the curve which is not
banked —or (technically) super-elevated.
The Duke arrives at Spalding.
His notion that high speeds will rip the
spikes out is a fallacy. The effect of a
C 36 hitting a curve at speed is that most
of the sprung weight is concentrated in
an almost vertical direction on the out-
side rail —not horizontally, as is com-
monly believed. —Ex-Loco (N.S.W.) V
Defence and the League
Why should necessary armaments and
the League of Nations be considered as
rival means of defence? Neither has
succeeded notably, and they may both be
futile ; but judged by results to date the
League of Nations has rather a better
chance than another cruiser and a few
aeroplanes. No doubt this is because its
efforts are indirect. Peace, like happi-
ness, is a by-product, and the League’s
usefulness for defence is a by-product
of its workaday routine. Its public
meetings are merely shock-absorbers.
Of course, there can be no actual
assurance against war. But the pessi-
mists who say that nothing can be done
are defeatists. The League may be a
forlorn hope, but so was the idea of Eng-
land in the Dark Ages. England was
not united by force, nor by fear, but by
the commonsense of its people, and even
in the dark ages of to-day the League
has a sporting chance if the people think
The Duke arrives at Ouorn.
so. Its worst enemies are those who, like
H. G. Wells, sneer at its weakness and
thereby make it weak. They clamor for
a super-Government, but Britishers will
not tolerate a super-Government. All we
can do is to protect ourselves as best
we may by old methods of armaments,
and to reinforce our protection by giv-
ing the new idea every chance as well. —

The Abo. Problem
What Professor Elkin calls “the very
careful estimate” of the abo. population
in 1788, published in the “Commonwealth
Year-Book” (B. 3/10/’34), was guess-
work —about as valid as an “estimate”
of the standard diet of the moon-men,
considering that a great deal of Australia
was never seen by whites until three-
quarters of a century afterwards. Even
to-day, with faci-
lities for fast tra-
vel and the whole
country explored,
the enumeration
of some existing
tribes is mere
guesswork, and if
Professor Elkin
doesn’t know it
he doesn’t know
much about the
North.
Mr. Elkin tells
us that “anthro-
pologists do not
interfere with
tribal customs,
but study their
meaning and
social function.”
The very pres-
ence of a non-
initiate within a
tribe in its pristine
state is enough to
inhibit some of its most important cere-
monies and divert the attention of the
tribe from its rigid routine. I defy any
grown anthropologist to gain a know-
ledge of a local language sufficient to
enable him to do effective research work
without a long course of study —when he
does learn, he is usually the stone on
which all the tribal leg-pullers whet their
humor. There are some excruciating jokes
in the works of the authorities whom Mr.
Elkin cites which only a blackfellow or
one who had lived his childhood among
blackfellows can appreciate.
Isolation of remaining wild tribes from
all white contact is the only thing that
will save them. The professors can have
the, camp and mission abos. to practise
on. — Yeni-punyamai (N.S.W.). - ‘
Making a Little Do
In a Victorian court recently the magis-
trate had reason to “express his surprise
at and admiration for a family that
could live respectably on £1 18s. 9d. per
week.” It became the turn of other
people to express their surprise at the
magistrate. One correspondent wrote to
a Melbourne newspaper:
My entire income consists of a pension
of £3 a fortnight. My rent is 15s. a week, \
and on the balance we have to manage
—myself, wife and two young children.
We do not claim to live wildly, but with
every care we have sufficient.
A woman chipped into the argument. She
and her husband have sustenance work at
30s. a week, and they are not in debt:
We have bought everything, including
wood, and my man has' never gone to
work ill-fed or ill-clad. But we have
never gone out to amusements. I have,
never bought bread, because a sack ol
flour costs only 16s. 6d. and lasts almost
seven weeks. ' ■
She adds that she asks for “no praise. '
She is “not proud of being a dole-
worker's wife.” But Australia has
reason to be proud of people who are
doing so much on so little. They deserve
a better fate than to be oh the dole.—
Newpoor (Vic.).
Best in the World
“El Verdugo’s” article (B. 19 /9 / ’34) is
a new development of the inferiority
complex now so popular amongst some
of my fellow-countrymen ; it has re-
placed the superiority complex with
which I was familiar in my childhood,
passed in the fair city of Adelaide.
In those days when we built a post
office we built one large enough for a city
five times as populous. When our fore-
bears laid out their parks they made
them huge enough for the children of a
million-city to play in. We were the
proud owners of an estate which ran
from the Antarctic Ocean to Port Dar-
win. We spent a lot of money on it
and ran a railway into it, and believed
that it was destined to flower and flourish
and be a wonder in history. Later we
discovered that it was mainly desert and
that fertile South Australia was a ridi-
culously small portion of the earth’s
surface.
But we didn’t say that we were lucky
to be alive at all considering how
much worse off for fertility were the
people in the Scilly Islands. We pushed
out in other directions. A manufacturer
started to build motor-bodies.
Presently people all over the
country were scooting about
in cars whose bodies had
been made in Adelaide. We
also helped to make a navy
and an army- and a White
Australia policy.
In other words, we be-
lieved in ourselves; and if
some of the belief was
founded on faulty premises
it spurred us to action, some
of which was fruitful, and it
saved us from sitting down
like Mr. “Verdugo” and con-
templating our empty stom-
achs and assuring ourselves
that at least they were not as
empty as that of a starving
Chinese coolie. We thought,
in short, that we were the Best
in the World or, at any rate, could
make ourselves such. As a result
of so thinking we certainly improved,
on the standards of our fathers,
•and if things have gone a bit awry at
the moment they won’t be made better
by accepting the dreary mentorship of
Mr.-“Verdugo.” .
Mr. “Verdugo,” in short, is a bit of
an old fogey. We had plenty of old
fogeys in the old days in Adelaide, but
they weren’t as vocal as they seem to be
at present. —F. S. S. (S.A.).
The Old School
Whatever else Brisbane Grammar did
for “N.S.L.” (B. 3/10/’34), it didn’t de-
velop his memory very accurately.
Records for ’99 and 1900 show that
junior teams played in State-school fix-
tures—and in others less democratic. His
references to cadet privileges are unfair.
The school cadets were a crack corps
supported on. a subscription of tuppence
a week ; it was armed because it armed
itself. It proved itself invincible on
the rifle range.
The Sargood Shield competition among
all the public schools of Australia came
to an abrupt end when B.G.S. won it in
straight years. The Intercolonial Schools
Trophy went the same way. The Empire
Shield was not won while “N.S.L.”
was at school —the competition didn’t
exist them. The trophy was not a tor-
toise-shell crescent; it was a shield in
1903 and 1907, plus the cup presented
by the King in the latter year. “If there
was coaching, it was kept dark.” Cer-
tainly not from me. I was an emer-
gency for the 1907 team, and I used
to get 16 hours a week of it for weeks
on end. The team got more.
“N.S.L.” says the “Grammar” tradi-
tion “hung on a few big names—T. J.
Byrnes leading.” Well, let’s look at the
Upper School-of the year before he went
there.' There were 61 boys in it, so when
the war broke out all of them must have
been over 30 ; 39 succeeded in getting
to the front; nine were killed and a
good many wounded —some seriously.
Twenty-one “snobbishly” went as privates.
• Among-the 61 I find these names: A.
C. Davidson, g.m. of the bank of N. S.
Wales; Brigadier-General Jim Cannan,

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
There were many racing sensations at
Caulfield. Perhaps the most thrilling was
the Caulfield Guineas triumph of Theo.
In 1933 this event resulted in a boil-
over, Palphar (16 to 1) easily defeating
Hall Mark (5 to 4). It is rather amazing
that Theo, winner of the A.J.C. Derby
in such meritorious style, should have
been allowed to go out at 25 to 1 remem-
bering that his owner, Ned Moss, bets
on a big scale. However, Moss seems to
.have shared the public view that Theo
was urtsuited by a journey of a mile.
At the. half-way stage Theo was last,
with Sir John as companion. He came
on the scene like a whirlwind at ihe
half distance, overpowered Jack Holt’s
candidate, Hyperion, and scored by
three-quarters of a length, with Aztec
half a head behind Hyperion. The place-
getters were quoted at 25 to 1, 33 to to 1
and 16 to 1 respectively. The most
astounding Caulfield Guineas result in
history.
Titanium, the 6-to-4 favorite, was
“ridden into the ground” after being
hampered in the first two furlongs. He
moved up close to the pacemaker,
Radiant Star, along the railway side, but
too much energy had been absorbed in
the process, and Titanium was well-
Bert' ‘’'"The Dukes coyunq here v

beaten at the turn, fading right out.
Dark Sky, next in demand to Titanium,
had every chance, but simply wasn’t good
enough on the day. Arachne may be
forgiven, as she did not have the best
of passages. If he had not run out wide
at the straight entrance, when suddenly
rushed to the front, Great Legend might
have been placed, and Farndale did well
to get fourth, after being nearly down
on his nose at the three-furlong post.
Though Foulsham, the Caulfield
trainer, must have been chagrined over
the downfall of Titanium, whom he has
decided to spell, he had reason for
satisfaction at Aztec putting forth a
splendid effort from the half-mile, which
almost carried him to the front just be-
fore Theo asserted himself. Hyperion
revealed his very best form since his
arrival from Westralia several months
ago, and Holt soon may be rewarded for
his perseverance with this son of Pan-
theon.
Holt had won the previous event, the
Caulfield Stakes, with Hall Mark, who
never was in finer galloping trim. The
trainer expected Kellow’s chestnut to
make a creditable race of it with Chat-
ham and Rogilla ; but when commenting
on prospects he remarked, “Chatham is
a wonderful horse.” The reputation of
Chatham has not been lessened by his
defeat. He made all the running, and the
determined opposition of Rogilla for
seven furlongs prevented any slackening
of speed.
Meanwhile, Dempsey was biding his
time with Hall Mark, three or four
lengths behind the favorite. Dempsey
delights in riding a race in this fashion.
Half-way down the straight he launched
a challenge which Chatham could not
resist. They had a tussle which will be
remembered for years to come. Chat-
ham shifted out a trifle, but Hall Mark
would not be denied and won on the post
by a head, Rogilla being three lengths
farther off.
On a track which was somewhat dead
because of heavy rain on the Thursday
and Friday, Hall Mark covered the nine
furlongs in lmin. 51fsec., which is only
three-quarters of a second outside the
course record for the distance, estab-
lished by Chatham in the corresponding
event last year. After the Stakes Hall
Mark would have been favorite for
the Caulfield Cup if the bookmakers
could have known definitely whether he
would start. He won’t.
Carrying 161 b. more than his Cup im-
post, 7st. 51b., Sir Simper landed the
Toorak Handicap in a manner for
which there is no parallel in the history
of the race. Five furlongs from home
he was last of a strung-out field. How
Dempsey ever managed to make up the
lost ground with Sir Simper and beat
Hostile by half a head is an insoluble
puzzle. Journal was a close third. Sir
Simper is “one out of the box,” and,
with ordinary luck in running, he ought
to account for Rogilla in the Caulfield
Cup at a difference of 331 b.
Broad Arrow (6 to 1) captured the
Herbert Power Handicap in meritorious
fashion. Never farther back than third,
he cut down Panto a furlong from home,
and came on to win impressively from
St. Valorey (12 to 1) and Gaterina (8
to 1) in 2min. 20|sec. for the 11 fur-
longs—pretty good time on the day. The
Sydney Cup winner has thrived in Mel-
bourne and is a very fit horse.
But what is to beat Sir Simper for
the Caulfield Cup? With 7st. 51b. he
looks to have a mortgage on it. His
most dangerous opponent may be Farn-
dale, who will yet prove himself a good
colt. Sydney form looks a bit better
than Melbourne form, so Broad Arrow,
Journal and Waikare must be respected.
This Page fancies Sir Simper, 1 ; Farn-
dale, 2 ; Journal, 3.
* * * *
“D.E.”: Hall Mark covered a mile and
a furlong in lmin. 51|sec. Theo took
lmin. 40!sec. to traverse a mile. Time
may not be an exact guide, but you can’t
disregard it. Theo is now all the rage,
but I suggest he has yet to prove himself
in the same class as Hall Mark.

Trainer Peter Riddle and jockey W.
Cook will remember City Tatt.’s meet-
ing at Randwick pleasurably. Riddle won
a double with Satmoth and Medallist;
Cook rode three winners, Hurlstone,
Satmoth and Medallist.
Satmoth (7 to 2) is hard to beat when
he hits the front and is allowed to bowl
along at his leisure. He was in City
Tatt.’s Handicap, and at the finish he
was going away from Deputy Ruler and
the favorite, Roxburgh. Roxburgh was
asked to give Satmoth too much start
over the last half-mile ; but the little grey
will be all the better for the outing.
Backed from 20 to 1 to half those odds,
the Heroic mare Porcia had an uncom-
monly easy victory in the Flying Han-
dicap. She was expertly handled by Tom
McGrath’s apprentice Murphy, who
comes from Victoria. Bim Boy and
Bronze Hawk filled the places ; Dame
Moab, who started favorite, made a dash
at the Leger but could only run fifth.
There was an excuse for Legislator, who
looked nice and bright. He was in
trouble early and had to be checked
several times.
Timekeeper Kerr has a tophole colt
in Medallist (6 to 4), who made hacks
of the others in the Two-year-old.
Medallist cost 425 guineas; he is by
Legionnaire from a Magpie mare, Smart
Bird.
The Maoriland-owned Capris (6 to 1)
proved too good for the opposition in
the Three- and Four-year-old. High
looked a winner at the Leger, stumbled,
and Capris worried him out of the prize.
First Son, third, is worth keeping in
mind, and King’s Head showed enough
pace to win* on suburban tracks. The
favorite, Gothlin, cut up badly.
Both divisions of the Novice were
brisk betting mediums. In the first,
Hurlstone, by David, carrying Otway
Falkiner’s colors, scorpd at eights from
Family Pride and Slinger, and High
Cross proved a good thing for the second
division, as the price—6 to 4—indicated.
There were protests in both heats ; both
were quickly dismissed.
Ridden by an unknown apprentice,
Ward, who weighs sst. 71b., the Wind-
bag mare Chatterelle (10 to 1) ran away
with the Club Welter from Archmel and
Ramrod. The favorite, Tatyoon, was
badly away, was rushed up to the leaders
in the first half-mile, and compounded
at the turn. Dromos was fourth after
getting a bad passage ; and Cynical was
another to meet with a lot of interference.
Chatterelle is trained at Canterbury by
F. W. Adams. Early backers got 25
to 1.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Some rattling good wrestling was seen
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday when
Gus Sonnenberg defeated Tony Felice in
four rounds, and Ali Bey (15st.) accounted
for the much lighter Oki in three.
Sonnenberg in particular shaped like a
champion. At Leichhardt, Burmister did
a lot of clowning with Lurich, and was
adjudged the loser in the fifth round
after the “wrestlers” and the referee had
fallen through the ropes. Sonnenberg
could beat Lurich and Burmister in the
same ring.
The Nineteenth Hole
W. Bolger, the 24-year-old professional
at Oatlands club, near Sydney, staggered
all and sundry by winning the open golf
championship of Australia at Rose Bay
links with a card of 283 for 72 holes.
This equals the open championship
record shared in Great Britain by Sara-
zen and Cotton, and is seven better than
the previous best Australian figures. In
view of the varying nature of golf
courses, comparisons may be odious,
but the young player took the lead
from the beginning, and held it through-
out the four rounds —an unheard-
of feat’. For the rest of it, he defeated
the mighty Sarazen, who can call him-
self world’s champion if anyone can, by
three strokes. J. D. Spence, of Leura,
with 288, was third, and Kirkwood
fourth, with 291.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: The line-up for the
Australian open championship at Rose
Bay (N.S.W.) was not as formidable as
was hoped. In addition to the absence
of the Australian amateur champion,
Hope, Rufus Stewart was prevented by
illness from turning out. Ivo Whitton
was also an absentee, and the pair will
be hard to replace.
* * * *
“Brassey”: Sydney is threatened with
yet another golf club —none of your nine-
hole municipal affairs, but a really posh
show. A group of Chatswood people
is sponsoring the scheme, and has
its eye on 42 acres of ideal golfing
country a mile west of Chatswood rail-
way station. Well sheltered and varied
in contour, much of it is well grassed
already, offering opportunities for more
than one natural fairway.
* * * *
“Huon”: The Tasmanian golf cham-
pionships provided no surprise. Left-
hander Len Nettlefold, who had been
ousted in 1933 after winning for three
consecutive years, came back by defeat-
ing the title-holder, G. A. Brown, 4 and
3, for the amateur title. The fight for
the professional honor has long resolved
itself into a family feud. J. Robertson
had the better of it until 1932, when
his heir outed him. Since then the young-
ster has held the fort, his last victory
being 3 and 1 over 36 holes of match.
* * * *
“Smashie”: Mrs. Halstead, of Green-
wich (U.S.A.), was recently granted a
divorce because her husband made fun
of the way she played golf. There is
an Australian golfer who has as good a
case. A middle-marker, he yielded dis-
gustedly to his wife’s entreaties to teach
her the game. In six months the lady had
reached such proficiency that now, when
the old man asks her humbly to partner
him in a foursome, she tells him to hunt
up someone his ov/n class and not spoil
her game.

Footbrawl
In the presence of 65,000 Richmond
and South Melbourne met again in the
Vic. League’s grand final on Saturday.
Game was hard throughout; the Tigers
were better in the air, and all through the
piece gave the impression they were going
for a fixed objective regardless of any op-
position. And that was how it went.
South launched flying attacks, only to be
brushed aside. Starting the third quarter
with 6 goals 5 behinds to the Tigers’ 10
goals 8 behinds, the Red-and-Whites
finished the term with 6 goals 11 behinds
to 16 goals 11 behinds, and the game was
over. Final scores: Richmond, 19 goals
14 behinds (128 points); South, 12 goals
17 behinds (89 points). The defence on
both sides was fine: Bolger, Sheahan and
O’Neill for Richmond ; McKay and Aus-
tin for South. The Tigers’ centre line,
Geddes, Zscheck and Judkins, was
superior all through. But victory was
mainly due to the clever scouting and
tireless persistence of Martin, roving, and
Titus, forward. Nash got six goals for
South, Pratt but two, bringing his sea-
son’s tally up to 150. This is Richmond’s
fourth premiership.
“G.M.”: Richmond and South were
wonderfully well-matched in physique.
Richmond averaged 12st. 4|lb. in weight
and sft. 10|in. in height, as against
South’s 12st. 91b. and sft. lO^in.; average
ages, 25| and 25|. There were six six-
footers in Richmond’s team and five in
South’s. The tallest man picked was
Harris, of South, who attains an altitude
of 6ft. 2in. Kelleher, on the same side,
was the heaviest with 14st. 101 b., all
muscle. Judkins, of Richmond, sft. s!in.
high and 9st. 101 b. heavy, was the short-
est and lightest of the 36.
S.C.E.G.S. (or “Shore”) took out the
senior athletic championship of the
N.S.W.G.P.S. after a close tussle with St.
Joseph’s—there were 15 points between
them. Best performances in the senior
division were by Finau (New.), with wins
in the 120 hurdle and shot putt; Porter
(St. J.), who took both the sprints, the
100 in 10 l-ssec., and Shetliffe, of
“Shore,” whose 6ft. high jump was the
only new senior record.

IN QUEEN ST BRISBANE
Under the Whip
Inglis and Cos. held a small sale of
bloodstock in Sydney after the spring
meeting. The best price was 300gns.,
given for the three-year-old colt Imitate,
by Baralong (imp.) from the Magpie
mare Mimic, R. Wootton appearing as
the buyer. Moss, owner of the A.J.C.
Derby winner Theo, put up Antique, for
which he paid 600gns. two years ago,
and let him go for 30 guineas.
* * * *
“Walkabout”: Birdsville, in far south-
western Queensland, must hold at least
one world’s record. The other day, ama-
teur rider W. Brok, in the ten races on
the programme of the B.A.R.C. meeting,
scored nine wins and a second. No
walkovers; all good fields.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Auditor-General’s report
on racing revenues shows how hard the
sport has been hit by slump and over-
taxation. The peak year was 1928-29,
when the course admission tax returned
£129,712. Next year it was down to
£86,000 —leaving out odd figures—and
the drop continued with £76,000 and
£71,000. Last year the barometer rose to
£78,000. Similarly, in the 1928-29 period
the tote bite was £193,986. This dropped
successively to £142,000, £122,000 and
£104,000, with a rise to £IIO,OOO last
year. Bagmen’s fees fell from £31,273
in 1932-33 to £28,904 last year, and 79
fewer licenses were applied for.
Ins and Outs
“Funiculi”: All the Australian crick-
eters save Bradman reported on the
Orient liner at Naples last week, and are
now well on their way home. Bromley
is fit again after his operation, and will
hop off at Perth for a bit to stay with
his people. All the players will be seen
in action in the Woodfull-Ponsford bene-
fit match at Melbourne in November,
Bradman, of course, excepted.
$ * * *
“Stanley”: That query as to whether
South African Christy’s £4OO p.a. for
coaching Queensland colts is additional
to a salary from a sports store which is
utilising his services (B. 10 /10/’34) is
easily answered. It is not, the Q.C.A.
providing £225 and the store and others
the balance. Christy has been cabled
£IOO for fare and expenses, so is doing
fairly well.
:[c * * *
“Brass Addler”: The Australian
cricket States are sitting back in that
state of blissful anticipation which marks
a family when the news comes along that
Great-aunt Ermyntrude has died without
making a will. In other words, the Board
of Control has announced a preliminary
distribution of the profits from the Aus-
tralian Eleven’s tour of England. Vic
toria, Ma and South Australia each get
£4BOO ; Queensland’s whack is £3200, and
Tassie and Westralia take £I6OO each.
“Tenth Slip”: Sydney will get a
glimpse of the N.S.W. members of the
Australian Eleven in a match for the
benefit of Sydney Blind Association to
be played at S.C.G. on November 13.
Harold Heydon, of the N.S.W.C.A., and
Fingleton are organising the sides, and
other notable men in the world of
cricket are lending every assistance. Play
begins at 1.30 p.m. on the Tuesday, and
as the Australian players must leave for
Melbourne for the Woodfull-Ponsford
benefit match the fc flowing day they
should be glad of a bit of practice.
❖ * ❖ ❖
“Tenth Slip”: Following the Woodfull-
Ponsford testimonial match, which begins
on November 16, the Sheffield season
opens with a N.S.W.-South Australia
clash in Sydney on November 23.
From there the S.A. players go on to
Brisbane, and the Queenslanders are
moving heaven and earth to get South
African Christy out in time to play in
this game. Other States are willing to
waive the three-months’ residential quali-
fication in the South African’s case, but
he will be cutting things very fine.
“Hat”: The Rest of Australia team
to meet the Australian Eleven in Mel-
bourne next month is already being
picked. A likely lot are: Richardson
(capt.), Badcock, Lonergan, Tobin,
O’Brien, Nagel, Alexander, Fingleton,
Chilvers, Hill, Andrews and Easton
(’keeper). One man certainly wont be
picked. That is Ron Oxenham, who
has already been getting bags of wickets
in Queensland.
* * * *
“Snitch”: Maoriland has got the pip
very badly over what it considers Aus-
tralia’s neglect of All-Black cricket. The
Islanders think Australia might boost
them along by sending at least a .State
team over the Tasman every year. But
if M.L. considers what a full season Aus-
tralian cricketers have even in a Shef-
field Shield season like the present, they
should realise how difficult it is to pay
such visits. When there is a team from
overseas in addition, no amateur crick-
eter of class in this country has time to
do any work for six months of the year.
"Go and see Kirkwood if you like. John, but I’m staying here. He's
much funnier.”
Besides, M.L. is pernickety. Last year
the B. of C. literally scoured Australia
to pick a team for M.L. after the Aus-
tralian XI had departed. When it at last
had scraped together a mob and sent
the names to the All-Blacks, the latter
cancelled the invitation. Some people
are so hard to please.
The Nineteenth Hole
A lot of interesting golf was seen in
Sydney last week. The N.S.W. amateurs
wiped the floor with the Victorians, the
latter winning only one match of six,
when Williams beat Jim Ferrier. Vic-
toria scored in the foursomes champion-
ship of Australia, A. W. Jackson and
M. Ryan beating McKay and Ruwald,
of Killara, with a card of 151. In an
exhibition match before the champion-
ship meeting got going Sarazen and
Kirkwood beat Esplin and Mackenzie,
4 and 3. Sarazen went round in
69, two better than the Kenso par
At-Manly young Ferrier and Hattersley
<>ave the visitors a better go, being all
square at the 16th. The Americans won
the last two holes.
“Sandringham”: Six months ago
The Bulletin announced that Sarazen
and Kirkwood would not be allowed by
the Victorian G.U. to play on any of
the registered Victorian goll courses be-
fore the centenary golf tourney, on the
ground that prior appearance would
affect the gates. This has duly come
to pass, and the visitors have been
notified that if they try to stage
a show on an unregistered course
before the big affair their entries foi
this will be cancelled. The gate plea
is puerile. To all golfers the preliminary
appearance of the two lamous play,.is
would be like a gin and bitteis beloie
dinner, giving an extra zest for the feast
to come. It is a case of the poisonous
old inter-State jealousy. The Sarazen-
Kirkwood visit was engineered in N. S.
Wales, and that 'was enough.
:\i *
“Westward Ho”: The final of the Eng-
lish women’s golf championship at Skeg-
ness, which is near the place where King
John lost his luggage in the Wash, was
won by Phyllis Wade, of Bournemouth,
4 and 3. The fair Minoprio was
knocked out after staggering her early
opponents with her eye-blasting toggery
(B. 10/10/’34). Like a cuckoo, she
changed from her bird-of-paradise array
to a suit of solemn black. Of course,
the English girls got their breaths back
and were able to play golf.
“Carnoustie”: One reason why golfers
from other States are shy of visiting even
big events like the Australian champion-
ships these hard times was confided to
writer by an ex-Victorian now in Sydney.
He figured out that a Melbourne man
entering would part up £lO for fares.
Board and keep would take another ten-
ner for 10 days in Sydney—a modest
estimate. Caddies and balls would be
cheap at £5, and entry fees would
come to 30s. Leave £lO for extra meals
and the nineteenth and there would be
little of £4O left to go to the Cup with.
* * * *
“Lakeside”: The American profes-
sional team, reaching Sydney on Novem-
ber 6, will meet a team of N.S.W. pros,
on November 7 and 8. The showman
of the circus promises to be Louis
Diegel. Something of an eccentric, he
is a tremendous driver and a deadly
putter —a not very common combination.
His putting stance is one of the world’s
wonders, and people have been known
to cross the American continent to see
it. With in-toed feet, his elbows are
held at right-angles to his body, and, as
he is long in the wing, the effect is mirth-
provoking. The stylist of the team is
Cooper, whose swing is as near perfec-
tion as poor humanity can hope to
attain. Others are Runyan (capt.),
Shute, open champion of Britain in 1933,
Craig Wood and Laffoon.
sjc * * *
“Moucher”: Those derelicts who al-
ways hang round golf links, especially
the public variety, include, nowadays, as
many grown men as small boys in their
ranks. Their objective is the same, the
stealing of “lost” golf balls and the re-
sale of them to golfers, who are really
participes criminis. One of these gentry,
presented at court in Sydney last week
and given a paltry 14 days in gaol, had
the hide to plead that he was a profes-
sional “golf-ball finder.” He carried a
pair of field glasses, and after watching
the finish of a smack into the rough at
Moore Park—his h.q—strolled over and
“helped” the player to look for it. When
nabbed, he had a lot of “lost” balls in
his pockets. He admitted that his duties
as a “finder” kept him on the links from
4 a.m. to 6 p.m. and said there were 30
other professional finders on Moore Park
alone.
“Corso”: After the exhibition match
at Manly, Sarazen-Kirkwood and Ferrier-
Hattersley, the big crowd was treated
to an unusual interlude. Sarazen gave a
driver to be put up to auction lor the
benefit of Manly Cottage Hospital. It
brought 16 guineas.
* * « *
“Shirley”: A. J. Shaw has won the All-
Black open for the sixth time in nine
years with a score of 288 for the 72 holes.
Another pro., N. Bell, was runner-up with
293. Shaw seems in a class by himself
in M.L. golf. The Bledisloe Cup for the
amateur with the best score in the open
went to Bryan Silk, whose card showed
296.
* * * *
“R.R.”: Another contribution to the
list of unusual golf incidents. Playing
at Kyogle (N.S.W.) a player was struck
on the leg by a ball. Everyone lost sight
of the thing, which could not be located.
The struck player reached into his trou-
sers pocket for a match, and found the
pill there. It had rebounded from his leg,
struck his golf bag, and cannoned into
the pocket.
Racquet and Bawl
“Westchester”: Fred Perry continues
on his wild career in the U.S.A. Last
week he won the Pacific Coast cham-
pionship at Berkeley (Cal.). Since he
beat Crawford at Wimbledon, Perry has
won everything he has gone after, in-
cluding the All-American title and all
manner of minor events throughout the
U.S.A., for the smaller the chickenfeed
the better the young man seems to like
picking it up. There is a hint of stale-
ness in the fact that a Yankee unknown
named Budge ran him to five hard sets
in the final at Berkeley. The opposition
he will meet here will be pretty tough,
as far as the visiting contingent is con-
cerned, and the Englishman will need to
be careful.
* * *
“Snort”: N.S.W. tennis heads are
fuming again. Months ago, when the
visit of an English women’s tennis team
was fixed, M.L. arranged for the girls to

play there. In the meantime, Ma had
fixed up a series of matches with
the tourists for the dates arranged by
M.L., November 15-16. She wrote the
All-Blacks suggesting it would be a sport-
ing gesture for them to cancel the M.L.
show and shove the visitors along to
make a Sydney holiday. The M.L. coves
icily refused. So there is nothing for it
but to ask the A.L.T.A. for the November
21-22 dates, and that is being done.
He * ❖
„ “Top Spin”: N.S.W. tennis heads have
decided to cut their admission prices for
the coming State championships. On
the first day, November 24, the price will
be 6s. to 2s. for the men’s matches. For
the next three days 2s. will be charged
for admission to the saddling paddock,
with 2s. extra for the stands. The semi-
finals on November 29 and 30 will cost
from 7s. 6d. to. 2s. The hold-up on the
final day is to be from 10s. to 2s. This
means a drop of ss. for the swank seats,
which in the past have been 15s.
•I* *l®
“Cash Amateur”: Australian tennis
addicts were mildly startled at the news
cabled last week that Von Cramm, the
German amateur, had played the profes-
sional Nusslein and beaten him in what
is styled a “professional match.” If this
is so, the German drops out of the ama-
teur ranks, since the International Federa-
tion some time ago refused to counten-
ance even exhibition matches between
amateurs and paid men, and it is hardly
likely that a special dispensation was
granted. Tilden at the end of the season
counted the German the best' amateur
playing, not excluding Perry. Certainly
he has made wonderful progress during
the past few years.
* * * *
“Noils”: What looks like another
bang for the Australian wool industry is
reported. American experts have discov-
ered a new method of covering a tennis
ball with a woollen preparation which
will never wear out. Hitherto superfine
merino has been used for the covering
of the best balls, and, good as this is, it
does not last for ever. The new pro-
cess covers the ball with a knitted wool
instead of the closely-woven cloth. As
the old coat wears away, a new nap
grows in like a constant growth of wool.
Strands in the cloth open every time the
ball hits the court, and the cover remains
fluffy right to the end, instead of wear-
ing bare and rendering the ball unplay-
able. It is a mixed yarn, and somehow
reminds me of the gentleman who tried
to lift himself off the floor by his own
braces.
“Sworder”: Tennis is going back to
the Middle Ages for inspiration. Writer
has told aforetime of the great two-
handed swords of those days which con-
tained a tube with a loose quantity of
quicksilver. This helped the raising of
the ponderous weapon by running down
to the hilt, and added great weight to
the blow by racing down to the point
when the stroke was made. An Aus-
tralian firm is to market a racquet on the
same principle, though another make
has been before the public for some time.
The tube of quicksilver is in the handle
of the racquet, and the moving metal
acts just as it did in the ancient swords.
* * V t-
“Amateur Pro.”: The English L.T.A.
has a motion tabled for its December
meeting which may have a very far-
reaching effect among the affiliated bodies
of the Empire if it is carried. It is to
prohibit players in any way connected
with the manufacture or sale of sports
goods from figuring as amateurs or
representing England or Britain in tennis
contests. If passed, the rule will knock
out such stars as G. JP. Hughes in Eng-
land. In Australia nearly every first-class
player will go into the discard. It is being
urged that the affiliated Dominion bodies
may pass “domestic” rules exempting
their players.
Miscellaneous
“Blade Sight”: The N.S.W. King’s
Prize, shot off this year at Anzac Range,
near Liverpool, was won by F. R. Agate,
of Sydney, by a single point: Agate,
343 ; F. C. Mason, another Sydneyite,
342. The scoring was tremendous
all through the meeting—early in the
week Agate got 43 consecutive bulls
in one match. It means that with
the new ammunition the size of the
bull’s-eyes will have to be reduced. At
many ranges the trouble is to keep off
the black.
“Hookworm”: As everyone in the
southern States knows, North Queensland
is peopled by a race of tropical-disease-
stricken wastrels who either fall victims
early to malaria or Weil’s disease or are
blown to pieces by Black Hand bombs.
Some of these people actually had the
audacity to hold a four-oared boat race
on the Johnstone River between Innisfail
and Cairns clubs—yes, they really have
clubs there —when the N.Q. champion-
ship was won by Cairns, a place which
rivals Singapore for tropical heat and
can give it 20 degrees any day on the
humidity scale.
* * *
“Quarter Butt”: Horace Lindrum, who
is to meet Joe Davis in a snooker tour-
ney at Melbourne early in November,
says that if he beats the redoubtable Joe,
who is England’s snooker as well as bil-
liards champion, he will go back with
Joseph to England. Horace holds world’s
snooker records and plays a fine all-
round billiards game as well. He should
draw well in England, where snooker
is much more popular than it is here.
* s;c * *
“Backwoodsman”: After months of
cogitation the committee appointed by
the Australian Bowling Council to re-
draft the laws of the game has presented
its report. There are no details yet, but
every sane person interested hopes that
provision has been made to pay the
travelling and housing expenses of
players touring in other States or abroad.
Incredible as it may seem, State or Aus-
tralian representatives under present con-
ditions have to find everything them-
selves. Members of Rugby Union and
Olympic teams, among the rigidly ama-
teur sporting organisations in the world,
are allowed these expenses without
question.
* :Jc :[i
“Comber”: The N.S.W. life-saving
heads are again considering sending a
team abroad to give exhibitions, and a
committee has been appointed to weigh
pros and cons. Many inquiries have
been received from overseas countries,
and if a trip is decided on invitations
will come in by the dozen, particularly
from South Africa and California. It
is proposed to send a team of 20, and this
would be a very expensive proposition,
especially if the tour is to more than one
country. However, with sufficient guaran-
tees the tour should go off well, and the
othersiders would get good value for
their money. Nothing like the elaborate
showmanship of the Australian surf life-
savers has ever been seen in any other
country, and the Americans especially,
who love that' sort of thing, should rush
it.
* * * *
“Third Base”: Once more we are being
told that an American baseball team will
visit Australia shortly. We have heard
the tale so often that everyone is dubious
about it, but this last furphy may be the
lucky one. An American shipping poten-
tate residing in Sydney says he is arrang-
ing for a visit from a mixed team of
professionals from the American and
National Leagues in January. The
team will play in Sydney, Melbourne
and Newcastle. What is certain is
that Ma State ’bailers will have a run
against the baseball team of the Ameri-
can cruiser Augusta at Petersham Oval
on Monday next. The Yankee carries a
big crew, and, as she is flagship of the
American Asiatic squadron, has had
plenty of practice against Japanese teams,
which are very high class.

Indigestion in its early stages shows
its presence by attacks of heartburn,
wind, belching, palpitation or griping.
Later come the more serious agonies
of dyspepsia, gastritis, colitis and
ulcerated stomach, duodenum or bowel.
The stomach has been wonderfully
protected by Nature to withstand abuse,
but there comes a time when neglect
of small disorders upsets the whole
digestive system. Tne acids of the
stomach actually attack the fabric of
the walls, and vomiting, continual thirst
and severe pain indicate that ulceration
of the stomach has set in.
Serious though these complications
are, Nature will heal the ulcers if she
is given help. De Witt’s Antacid
Powder is especially prepared to help
in this healing work.
Firstly, it neutralises the excess acid
which the stomach continually produces,
and allays the irritation.
Secondly, the ulcers are coated with
a film of colloidal-kaolin. So finely
powdered is this kaolin, it is easily
spread over the entire surface of the

Address
version at the Apollo, Melbourne, last
week was mainly notable for the crystal
singing of Thea Philips as the hunch-
back’s daughter. Appleton Moore’s Rigo-
letto was equipped with an excrescence
of moderate dimensions on his shoulders,
had a large boil on his leg and in the
famous monologue rose to great heights
of declamation. Ben Williams’s Duke of
Mantua needed a patent of rascality, but
his singing was excellent.
“Hamlet” in modern dress by the
Little Theatre people in Melbourne
turned out to be just as interesting as
“Hamlet” in the faded duds Allan Wilkie
used to hire from J. C. Williamson's
wardrobe. After all, the only people,
including Shakspeare, who have ever
worried about the historical anachro-
nisms in his plays have been university
professors. Jack Wiltshire wore plus-
fours, smoked cigarettes and donned
evening dress to shoot Polonius with an
automatic, all the while holding the
attention of the audience. Frederick Mc-
Mahon was an admirable Polonius, and
drew almost as many laughs as H. N.
Gregory, who was an outstanding First
Gravedigger.
Melbourne Tivoli programme has
gained generally in variety and partially
in quality by the arrival of the 25 inter-
national stars picked out of the world’s
casket by Frank Neil. The funniest con-
tribution is Joey Porter, who looks like
a slimmed Hitler and has a thoroughly
original style. Alec Halls, who comes
from the Wintergarden in Berlin ; Hope
and Ray, who hail from the Casino de
Paris; and MacDonald and Graham,
whose last address is given as the Zieg-
feld Follies, are also on the bill with-
out being all over it. But the most stag-
gering item is the scene where a Digger
all in silvered khaki makes a pacifist
appeal before a cenotaph for the world
to come out of the valley of death into
the garden of love, said garden being
populated entirely by semi-naked girls.
His query to the nations, “What the hell
are you fighting for?” is ambiguous in
the circumstances.

Several effects entirely new to the
musical ears of Brisbane were heard at
the Grainger-Austral recitals in Brisbane’s
Albert Hall. Mrs. Grainger and a few
locals smote percussion instruments with
vigor, and, in the lady’s case, with grace.
Several laurel wreaths encircled the
Grainger brow at the conclusion of a
series of “historical chambermiusic
recitals”: and a few certaiiUy were
earned by E. R. B. Jordan, who had been
sitting up o’ nights wrestling with the
musical literature and manuscripts for-
warded by the volatile Percy. At the
first recital Lena Hammond sang a
Belgian folk-song of the twelfth century,
with viola and 'cello obbligato, and with
the violin coming in softly after each
phrase. The phrasing was unique, and
only a vocalist with good lungs could
struggle with it, as five sentences have to
be exhaled on each single breath.

Brisbane Repertory staged a show in
aid of the funds of the Repertory
Theatre Society Orchestra; and, in spite
of the fact that the orchestra well deserves
some recognition, the public stayed away
in large numbers. Two one-act plays,
“The Second Guest” and “A Marriage
Has Been Arranged,” were on the pro-
gramme, and some excellent character-
acting was done by W. A. Blake and
Loftus Hyde in the first, and by Cecil
Carson and Esther Jones in the second.
Assisting vocal artists were Connie Swan,
who uplifted a sweet soprano, and Lou
Lambert, whose baritone has lost none
of its charm. The orchestral programme
included the second movement from
local lad Erich John's “Ursula” Sym-
phony.

if France Quits Gold
The premium on gold is the factor
which has revived many abandoned
Australian mines and led to the discovery
of some new fields. Last week the Lon-
don and Australian prices of the yellow
metal touched new records. Yet the
pound sterling expressed in U.S. dollars
was unusually strong.
This has puzzled many mining people.
When depreciation of the £ occurs it is
reflected in higher prices for gold and
gold currencies. In other words, sterling
will buy less gold or less gold currency.
When the dollar was a dollar—that is,
100 pre-war cents’-worth of gold—fluctu-
ations in the sterling price of gold were
in direct sympathy with the sterling price
of dollars. The 60-cent dollar is now
a rubber measuring-stick the same as
the pound. But the superstition of try-
ing to gauge the depreciation of sterling—
and the trend of the price of gold—by
comparing its exchange value with dol-
lars dies hard.
The franc is the one important cur-
rency still tied to gold. It is the true
yardstick. One golden sovereign is worth
124.2 gold francs. During 1933 the
closest sterling ever got to this parity was
90 francs to the pound ; the farthest it
drifted was to 78 francs. In June, 1934,
the average was about 77 francs, in July
~6{-, while at the middle of last week
the quote was 74. Here is the explana-
tion —or the chief outward symptom—
of the high price of gold.
The Australian price of the metal is
roughly 25 p.c. above the London rate.
The question intriguing many specu-
lators at' the moment is what will happen
to the London price if France leaves
the gold standard and allows its cur-
rency to drift.
The franc can’t appreciate much above
gold parity. As far as sterling is con-
cerned, if the present London-Paris rate
reflects the state of indebtedness between
the two countries, then that ratio should
be fairly well maintained, the further de-
preciation of sterling depending on how
far the paper franc drifted from gold
parity.
There is one factor which would be
liable to cause temporary confusion.
That is the flight which would take place
from the franc. As happened when the
dollar parted from gold, there should be
a strengthening of sterling so long as
any large-scale conversion of French
securities into English ditto was under
way. That, however, would be a passing
phase.
France’s export's for the first half of
this year averaged lower than at any time
since the war. Britain’s still show an
upward movement —practically the only
trend of its kind in Europe, and one
which is viewed rather enviously by
gold-standard countries on the other side
of the Channel.
C.B.S. Has a Centenary
Australia now has two banks a cen-
tury old. The pioneer was the ’Wales.
In 1834 the Commercial of Sydney
was born as a co-partnery in the Pul-
teney Hotel, with William Macpherson,
Treasurer of the day, as chairman.
On the board was Potter Mac Queen,
who that year welcomed Governor
Bourke to Segenhoe with an array of
“144 great Durham bullocks yoked to
18 iron ploughs on one side and, on the
other, 18 drays yoked with eight bullocks
to a dray and eight pack platoons of
other cattle loaded for the outstations.”
The hungry ’forties saw half the capital
written off ; but in 1848 the co. was in-
corporated under special Act, and since
then shareholders have never failed to re-
ceive an annual div. Gold was good to the
bank. In 1853 it established a London
office, and by 1860 it had eight branches
in N.S.W. and two agencies in Queens-
land. Then a financial storm struck the
latter State, and floods and droughts
made the ’sixties miserable in N. S.
Wales. Nevertheless, the bank celebrated
its 40th anniversary with its capital multi-
plied to 16 times the original amount.
When the disaster of ’93 came, the
bank held £9 15s. lOd. of the public’s
money for every £ of its own. It closed
its doors to reconstruct. It opened as a
new co. two days later, able to meet all
its obligations and to pay a 5 p.c. at
the end of the year.
It has been fortunate in its men.
Edward Knox, chairman in the ’forties,
and his descendants have had nearly a
century’s connection with the board (E.
R. Knox is deputy chairman). T. A.
Dibbs joined the service in 1847, became
g.m. in 1867, retired from the job in
1915 and died, still on the board, in 1923.
During his reign the number of branches
grew from 30 to 250. George Judah
Cohen, born the year in which Dibbs be-
came an employee, took the chairmanship
when Edward Knox died in 1901, and
was still in office when the bank paid
£2,217,000 for the Bank of Victoria in
1926. He retired a year or so back.
To-day, the paid-up capital of the
C.B.S. is £4,739,000, with reserves at
£4,300,000. Its branches number over
370.
A Relic of the ’Nineties
“Mulletah”: In the feverish quest for
gold-mining specs, some queer old pro-
positions are being rehashed. A Sydney
group has rounded up a bunch of Mur-
chison (W-A.) relics, among which is
one that, in its day, was harder to solve
than a rhabdomantic rebus. It was dis-
covered in 1892 blooming amid the salt-
bush with a 14oz. golden jewel lying
loose upon its milky-white siliceous
crown. There were three in the find,
and the division of the slug with a toma-
“Want any powder for cleanin’ yer bath with, missus?”
“No —1 never use it.”
“Cripes, won’t even y’ best friends tell yer?”
hawk and spawling hammer caused bitter
enmity among them, each maintaining he
was about an ounce short in the reckon-
ing at the shanty bar. They sank a few
feet on the spot, but the stone was spot-
lessly white.
In course of time Magnet was pleasur-
ably paralysed by the arrival of a mag-
nificent young Scotchman. / He was fol-
lowed by a waggonload of high-grade
furniture, bed- and table-linen, big-game
guns, fishing tackle, boxing-gloves and a
Soccer football, together with all appur-
tenances of a gentleman’s residence.
Many of his possessions were pinched by
the Mirroo-barlo blacks, who, traded the
loot throughout the countryside for
tobacco.
Big Scotty had never seen a mine in a
life that had been principally occupied
with stalking deer and following other
pursuits of a landed gentleman. He
took up the management of the golden-
topped show for a co. formed in Scot-
land, put on men, had a battery and
complete plant installed and started to
sink a main shaft. His reports to Scot-
land caused ructions among the hard-
headed gentlemen of the board, for the
figures proved that the deeper he sank
the shaft the nearer he was getting to
the surface on the other side of the
lease. But the big lad was honestly hog-
rooting for gold. The erratic conduct
was on the part of the reef.
When at length the main shaft had
been sunk so “deep” that daylight could
be seen at the “bottom” on the other
side of the property, and the only hope
of “sinking” further was by means of a
balloon, the directors in Scotland wound
the thing up. The reef was more re-
nowned for its amazing concave struc-
ture than for its gold, and I’ve often
wondered whether there ever has been
another one known like it.
The trade balance for July-August has
a sickly complexion reminiscent of the
bad old days. Exports for the two
months dropped in value about £1,500,000
sterling—wool dispatched, outside tops,
was worth only £1,939,000, against
£4,278,000 last year for the same period.
Imports increased about 30 p.c., from
£9,200,000 to £ 12,400,000-odd. Com-
modity balance, which last year was
in our favor £367,000 sterling, was
£4,577,000 sterling against us. The gold
and specie position remained about the
same as last year —£1,110,000 on the
right side. So that our total debit was
£3,468,000 sterling (£A4,335,000), instead
of a credit of £1,480,000 sterling, which
made politicians rejoice in 1933.
Gold price has touched a new high
level; Australian gold-mining scrip has
slumped. Which shows just how much
the market’s appraisement of the in-
dustry depends on the industry. Specu-
lation to date has been buoyed largely
by the eagerness of punters to dabble at
any price in the hope of passing the
scrip on; in the surfeit of good, bad
and indifferent floats lately nearly every-
one has been able to get in on the
ground floor. The market on the second
and higher floors has therefore weakened
considerably.

Maoriland recently became short of
oranges, and the embargo on the Aus-
tralian fruit was lifted temporarily. Now
Australia is short of spuds ; the price of
£l6 to £24 a ton ruling in Sydney has
attracted the eye of Maoriland farmers,
especially those in the Canterbury dis-
trict, where there is an abundance of the
vegetables. The danger of introducing
“powdery scab” from M.L. is said to be
the reason for the Australian taboo, but
a “conference” is to be arranged. Ordi-
nary duty on potatoes is £2 10s. a ton.

Those who have had the privilege of
inspecting Beale’s piano factory at
Annandale (Sydney) will be sorry to hear
that trade has been so bad that £105,000
(half the ord. capital) is to be written off.
Pref. shareholders are to be asked to
forego their div. arrears and accept a 5
p.c. div. hereafter (participating up to 8
p.c. with the ords. in good years). Trad-
ing losses are easing somewhat: £23,884,
£14,494 and £11,624 respectively over the
last triennium. The business was founded
in 1879 by an Irishman, Octavius Beale ;
he was killed a few years back in a car
accident when over 80 years of age. The
piano-factory is the largest in the British
Empire, and the product is 100 p.c. Aus-
tralian. Frames are produced in the fac-
tory from rough metal, veneers and other
timbers are worked up from the log—
the co. is probably the largest customer
of the Australian cabinet-timber cutter—
while screws and piano-strings are also
made on the premises. Beale and Co.
was one of the first really successful Aus-
tralian manufacturing concerns. Wire-
less, which had a tragic effect on the
demand for pianos, is now being turned
to account.

The banks have made a further reduc-
tion of \ p.c. in interest rates on fixed
deposits for 6-, 12- and 24-month terms.
One-year deposits now earn only 2| p.c.

Australia’s short-term debt amounts to
£82,267,000, mostly in Treasury bills.
From October 15 the interest charge on
this form of borrowing has been reduced
to 2 p.c. In June, 1931, when Lang was
in office in N. S. Wales, the rate was
6 p.c.; July, 1931, 4 p.c.; Nov., 1932,
3± p.c.; Jan., 1933, 3* p.c.; Feb., 1933,
2f p.c.; June, 1933, 2\ p.c.; April, 1934,
2} p.c. The saving to the States from
the latest cut amounts to £127,000. Pri-
vate banks holds nearly £30,000,000 in
Treasury bills.

Even the Customs Department is
stretching a point for the cen/eenary,
Tourists who bring cars into Australia
and take them away within 12 months
have hitherto been obliged to deposit the
equivalent of duty and sales tax with the
Customs and recover it on leaving the
country. The duty very often has been
substantial, and the finding of if incon-
venient. Guarantees by banks and
approved insurance cos. will now be
sufficient.

Latest estimate of the U.S. wheat crop
is 497,000,000 bushels, as against an aver-
age of 886,000,000 bushels for the quin-
quennium to 1931. Rainfall in the
Argentine has been too heavy in some
parts, and may affect yields. In Europe
the yield is about 16 p.c. lower, exclud-
ing the Russian crop. Overseas and in
Australia prices show signs of firming
again.

Melbourne Milk Board is making an
all-round cut of a gallon. The
farmer now gets from 9|d. to 10d..a

ever heard of the Sydney Milk Board
reducing the price?

Australasian Catholic Assurance Co.,
one of the most progressive young life

site for a home in King-street, Sydney.
The frontage to this thoroughfare is'
114 ft.; that to York-Street is 58ift. The
old buildings are to be demolished and a
new seven- or eight-storeyed structure put
up. Price paid for the freehold was
£50,000 cash.

David Jones, Ltd., the big Sydney de-
partmental store, is only four years
younger than Melbourne. The concern
celebrates its 96th birthday with a 10 p.c.
div. —proof of keen management in these
uncertain times. Not only does the co.
sell goods that others make, but it weaves
cotton, silk and other cloths at its Marl-
borough-street factory, afterwards mak-
ing them into garments. The old George-
street store is to be reconstructed at a
cost of £BO,OOO.


NORTH OF
TWENTY- EIGHT
The N.T. Election
“Kaloa”: There was a crispness about
Ihe N.T. election absent in the South.
Having only one newspaper the three
candidates had to share it. It backed
Nelson, the sitting Labor man, who
promised that “if Labor is returned
it will complete the North-South
Railway,” while “roads and feeders
must be built also.” He also diverged
from the general policy of Labor
by advocating “adequate home de-
fence—shore guns and bombers” ; and,
while he was all for white Australia
within limits, he promised to force the
“removal of the shackles of the Abori-
ginal Ordinance,” a tyrannous piece of
legislation which prevents half-caste
electors from having a drink. With these
promises and undertakings to have mis-
sions inquired into, indentured labor in
the pearling fleets abolished and wild-cat
mining schemes squashed—there were
some cold shivers in the North at that —
every “flotation to have the hall-mark of
the Government Geologist,” he contented
himself, adding self-government by an
advisory council of four for discount.
His Independent opponent weighed in
with “Be Sane, Vote Blain,” tendered an
apology for “being isolated in a distant
part of the Territory,” and gave pledges
to put gold-mining on its feet and to
found workingmen’s clubs, “where a man
can get all the newspapers of the Com-
monwealth every fortnight and sit down
and converse, with all the privileges of
city clubs at workers’ rates.” He wants to
educate the younger generation “both
practically and theoretically” and “send
them to the goldfields for trips,” and he
is for free and elective government of the
Territory and an import embargo on
Asiatics and peanuts. Blain looks like
winning. Probably it was the trips to
the goldfields that did it. The third
candidate was barely heard of.
“Eudlo”: “Marburg” (B. 3 /10/’34)
was wrong about Dr. Emil Hirschfeld,
once German Consul in Brisbane. He
was very much alive last time I saw him.
In the confusion just after the war he
was reported dead, but the cableman
erred, and some years afterwards he re-
turned to Brisbane to join his son in
practice there.
* * * *
“Q.C.R.”: A 75-year-old cripple of
Westwood (C.Q.) was wheeled the half-
mile from his home to the polling-booth
last month in a wheelbarrow. But they
do strange things in that region. At
Wycabah in one election long ago
somebody pinched a candidate, pretended
to get lost with him, and thus precluded
him from holding a much-needed meet-
ing.
* * * *
“J.Q.”: One Queensland citizen earns
£269 a week by the sweat of his brow,
or, as the Taxation Commissioner ele-
gantly phrases it, by “personal exertion”
—we have no millionaires. The Tax
Commissioner’s report shows that this
Croesus is not a pastoralist, as he is listed
under “miscellaneous occupations,” and
he got only £B9 from property. He had
to pay £5131 in State tax alone.
* * * *
“Dungeness”: Dunk Island, between
Cardwell and Mourilyan, where the late
“Beachcomber” Banfield lived, is being
organised as a tourist resort. The pro-
posal is to put £20,000 into a tropical
hotel. The island is about five miles
long, picturesque, and with a couple of
700 ft. wooded peaks on it and a good
natural water supply. There is an anchor-
age for large vessels, and plenty of boat
shelter in the s.-e. season. My brightest
memory of it is of racing to the Ban-
field house for a pair of trousers where-
with to attire the Viking figure of an
absent-minded young Englishman of
nudist proclivities who lived on Thorpe
Island, near by. He had come to pay
a call and had forgotten his own.
* * # *
“Bluey”: Queensland shows as a field
for sideshowmen are not so unprofitable
as “Hugh G.” (B. 26/9/’34) would have
us believe, nor do the police harass
the legitimate tentman. At the big
Exhibitions the “freelance” is the
real problem, both to police and
show authorities —the type of adven-
turer who owns a few sticks and a port-
able “roll down,” who pays neither
license nor ground fees, and plays any
game, from “ludo” to “banker,” until
caught. Speed devices were never more
popular, and the newest craze —water
dodge-’em boats —wins the blue easily as
a money-spinner. The sideshow business
may not have recovered its pre-depresh
vigor, but the just-concluded season in
the North proves that the glamor of
Canvas Town, with its motley of spruik-
ers. midgets, pugilists, snake-charmers
and vaudevilleans, still holds an irresist-
ible charm for the crowd.
« * * *
“W.L.K.”: Walter Lucas (B. 3/10/’34)
is not correct in accusing me of “loose
talk.” The word “Kanaka” is taken
from the French word “Canaque,” as
was stated correctly in a recent Bulle-
tin. In Fiji over 25 years ago, the late
Louis Becke told me that the word was
first used in connection with Bobby
Towns’s Queensland recruits in the
’seventies. All Pacific Islanders on
Queensland plantations, from Bundaberg
to Cairns, were Kanakas; no other term
was ever applied to them. And they
were not all Melanesians. Towns re-
“Where did you pick up the boy friend, Mary?”
“Catchum that pfeller in hollow log.”
cruited from even the islands in Torres
Strait, and New Guinea was extensively
worked until ’eighty-five.
* * * *
The end of the Glass Ball discussion:
“Margo”; If “Beachcomber” (B. 19/9/’34)
likes to call at Evans Head, near Lismore
(N.S.W.), he will quickly discover the origin
and use of his glass balls. There Jim Paddon,
known to the world as a sculler, weaves lobster
traps from native bamboo. These, amazingly
neat and finished, are baited with pieces of
fish, weighted with a stone, and then attached
to the much-discussed objects. The stormy
weather of two or three weeks ago took heavy
toll of them.
“Wob”: Let me inform “Tripod” and
“Beachcomber” that the glass balls which
find their way to Whitsunday are almost as
plentiful around Port Stephens (N.S.W.) as
politicians’ promises at election time. Till a
few years ago lobstermen used cork floats to
buoy the ropes on their pots. Then the
balls were introduced as being more easily
seen. They were first a Belgian product, but
are now made in Sydney, and cost about £1
a dozen. Different fishermen paint them dif-
ferent colors. We lost 18 pots after one
south-easterly gale.
sfc H: ❖
“Plaster”: “Maggoty’s” tale of having
to go 130 miles for sand (B. 26/9/’34)
reminds me of the time we were form-
ing Bathurst Downs, between Tobermory
and Lake Nash, on the N.T. side. After
our first bore was complete they decided
to put up a concrete tank. We got a
cement worker from the coast, bought
bags, borrowed tarpaulins, hired a team
and put it on to cart sand from the
Georgina River at the ’Dangie. One
afternoon the cementer, tired of waiting
for the waggon, went for a stroll. Within
half a mile of his camp he found better
sand than that being carted 70-odd miles.
If “Maggoty” has to go 130 miles for
sand he is in the centre of a sandless
circle with a diameter of 260 miles. That
would cover an area of approximately
a bit over 50,000 sq. miles. I would
recommend “Maggoty” to take a bit of
a stroll some Saturday afternoon.
“Vic”: All Queensland is not en-
tranced with the scheme for the
£2,000,000 bridge across the Brisbane
River, which already is bridged in two
places within the city area, or with the
project to carve out a Central-square
which will make the Roman Forum look
about the size of a suburban backyard.
Godfrey Morgan, member for Murilla,
remarked in the House the other day
that these huge outlays (not far short
of £3 per head of population) called for
protest while the locking of rivers in
the outback and the joining of western
railways to those of the N.T. and N.S.W..
as a drought-protection measure, re-
mained to be done. But Mr. Morgan
won’t stem the tide of expenditure in
the metropolis.

“Gryllus”: Biologically, the hordes of
grasshoppers which afflict N.S.W. and
Queensland are the Nemesis which re-
venges the destruction of the prolific
bird-life, particularly of plain-turkeys and
the straw-necked ibis. Nevertheless, a
noble and forgiving army of ibis has
appeared near Goondiwindi (Q.), and is
doing valiant battle with the foe. An
ibis consumes on an average 2000 young
’hoppers daily, and a big flock runs up
to 100,000 birds or more. In the interests
of the future, ibis and turkeys should be
protected rigorously, and systematic
entomological work should be carried
out to locate the breeding-grounds of
the ’hoppers, with a compulsory destruc-
tive treatment of these areas before each
hatch.
* * * *
“Yalla Yalla”: Queensland is adding
another air service to the half-dozen links
which bind its country towns. It is being
organised by a woman —Mrs. E. M.
Kelly, now in the south-west on behalf
of her. company looking over proposed
connections between Cunnamulla, 80l-
lon, St. George, Goondiwindi, Inglewood,
Warwick and Toowoomba. Capital is
being raised locally. I’m going to have
a fly on that route just for sentiment’s
sake, because my first trip over the west-
ern part of it was made on top of a
load of wool, with one of the last of
the convicts.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Brisbane soon will be as abandoned as one
of those cities of the plains mentioned in the
Scriptures. Those who aren’t packing for Mel-
bourne and the cen-/een-ary are hieing to
Charleville to view the air race.
Mrs. A. H. Whittingham is off to Melbourne,
partly for the celebrations and also to fare-
well her aunt, Mrs. Dick Casey, who is calling
in at Cairo en route to the Continent and
England. Mrs. M. S. Herring will break her
journey south in Sydney, but will stay with
Wilfred and Mrs. Fethers in Melbourne lor
Cup week. The Fred Eagers are motoring to
Melbourne, while Claire Godsall and Peggy
Bell go to the Narrigo.
Mrs. Margaret Curran had her first play.
“Blue Monday,” produced by the Toowoomba
Rep. Society recently. The theme is the effect
of a drop in the basic wage in the home of
a worker with a family of eight. Dorothy
Walker captured all the honors as Irene (“14,
but old for her age”). Dorothy is little older
than that herself, but she inherits her ability
from her mother. Una Hall was the mother
of the family, and A. W. Chessell took thjj
role of the wageplug.
Mr. and Mrs. F. Tritton are back Irorrt
Colombo, via Singapore, Japan and China':
They were to meet their daughter, poetess
Nelle (Madame Nadejine), at Colombo, but
her boat was late. Nelle is coming on by the
Romola.
Enid Dixon and her new husband, Frederick
Treuthardt, Peggy Chauncey and Wilf Spargo
helped to greet the Russian ballet on the
Nieuw Holland. Algeranoff and Elsie Tresshar
are among Enid’s best friends, and Peggy, of
course, was with the ballet in Pavlova’s day.
Algeranoff is to lecture on Japanese dancing at
Peggy Chauncey’s studio.
Black-haired, slim-ankled Olga Spessiva, the
prima ballerina, weighs 951 b.; a fact for which
Vilzak, who twirls her in the air quite a lot,
must be grateful. She is an attractive creature.
Of the 35 members of the bajlet, five or six
previously toured Australia with Pavlova.
The just-formed Brisbane branch of the
Overseas League held its first gathering at the
Lyceum Club. Our Sir Leslie was unable to be
present, so the vice-presidents, Mrs. Isaiah
Lahey and Miss M. K. Jarrett, received the
guests. A committee helped with the arrange-
ments, and Cecile Pritchard arranged
the musical programme.
The committee of the National Art
Gallery is trying to raise £lO,OOO by
public subscription to keep the John
Darnell bequest from lapsing. It will
have to come in at the rate of £2OO per
week. The Golden Book in which sub-
scribers’ names will be written
is a lovely thing, bound in
dark-red morocco. The front
cover is a sheet of plated gold
set round the edge with
Queensland gems, and the in-
side leaves are of fine hand-
made paper. Each leaf will
be decorated by an Australian
artist. Donors of £5O or more
get a page to themselves.
Dark-haired Ellen Mary
Ferricks said her “I wills”
at St. Andrew’s Church, Creek-
street, to Raymond Alec
Sankey Fraser. The newly-
weds each have a right to
place B.Sc. after their names.
Helen Munro was chief brides-
maid, and the other two ’maids
were Sybil Marton and Trixie
Ferricks.
Peggy Menzies, the golden-
haired lass who is in such
demand for charity mannequin
parades, is sporting a new
diamond ring, bought by Colin
Dight, elder son of the G. W.
Dights, of Yetman station, Inverell, N.S.W.
Betty Persse, daughter of the De Burgh
Persses, of Wyamben station, is packing her
trunks. She is going off to Cairo with Mrs.
Dick Casey.
Although they enjoyed themselves thoroughly
in America and England, Pat and Ella O’Shea
could not bear to think of a Melbourne Cup
being run and they not there to see it. They
will reach Melbourne in time for the big race.
Quite undeterred by the telegraphed news
that the Duke of Gloucester took the floor
with two out of a possible 70 dancing partners
at a Perth hop, hundreds of Brisbane girls are
hoping to foxtrot with him. Marjorie Wilson
is a certainty; State Commandant Ralph’s
daughter Eileen is odds-on for second choice;
but who of the vast number of debs, who
emerged at the recent United Service Ball will
be chosen still remains a mystery.
Two rinks of lady bowlers from Brisbane
and another from Rockhampton are going
down to take part in the centenary carnival.
The Dowager Lady Swaythling, one of
London’s hostesses, is coming out to stay at
our Government House. The lady is on 22
committees in London, including the Air
League, the English-Speaking Union, the Alli-
ance the Girl Guides, and a few
more, including a Food and Wine Society.
She does much work for hospitals and the
St. John Ambulance.
Hazel Murphy, chick of the Ashton Murphys
(many Bulletin readers will remember his abo.
sketches), married Jack Gardiner last week.
There was the usual round of bride-teas
before the ceremony.
Queenslanders were thrilled that the Duke’s
first dancing partners in Australia included one
damsel in which this State could claim a
proprietary interest. She was Betty Griffiths-
Bowen, and her father, Commander “Rowley”
Bowen, was stationed here in the days before
the war; he married a Brisbane girl, Corinne
Bruce Nicol. A bullet cut a groove in his
head at Kabakaul (New Guinea) in Australia’s
first fight.
Joyce Duncan, who at first had planned
to marry Frank Macfarlane in England, altered
her mind; and when the Hobson’s Bay sailed
Joyce was aboard proudly flaunting a shiny
new wedding ring. The bridegroom is one
of the engineers on the Ballarat, and his boat
got in just two days before the wedding,
which took place at St. Andrew’s Church,
Lutwyche, on October 10. Jessie Hill was
bridesmaid, and Bill Macfarlane best man.
The Country Women’s Association is raising
funds for the purchase of a wireless set for
the A.1.M., and No. 5 district has made this
its objective for next year. Gatton branch
has sent along five guineas, and Toogoolawah
has promised a donation. A really good wire-
less set would be of immense help to the
A.1.M., and the C.W.A. could not have thought
of anything more useful to give that very
necessary organisation.

An Industry woven into the
very fabric of Australian
National life, and invaluable
to the primary producer—
the manufacture of Linseed
Sheep Nuts and Linseed Oil
Meal by Meggitt, Limited.
Whether pastures are dry
or green, the feeding of
Meggitt’s results in a heavier
and improved fleece, better
carcases of mutton and
lamb, and a higher lambing
percentage.
Meggitt’s products contain
30% of digestible protein
and also approximately 7%
of laxative medicinal linseed
oil, which acts as a tonic
and conditioner, prevents
impaction and other diges-
tive troubles —and, in the
case of ewes, maintains a
free flow of milk, so that
lambs will be generously
nourished.
For
Improved
Dairy
Production
Thousands of dairy-farmers,
both pure-breeders and owners
of grade herds, feed Meggitt’s,
because they obtain profitably
increased yields.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Members of the London Empire
Society on their way to the Melbourne
centenary had a glorious week in Syd-
ney. They all liked Randwick, and those
who won thought our horses wonderful.
Knight Kelso King and his lady threw
open the doors of Quambi to them. The
visitors were whisked up to the Blue
Mountains and saw the wonders of
Jenolan. They ate a sandwich (or maybe
it was peanuts) over at Taronga amidst
the lions and the tigers. They paid a
visit to the monkey house, and came
back to cocktails and savories at the
Men’s Pioneer Club. Here they found
much to marvel at in the huge paintings
(they hang in three rows on the walls)
of the founders of Australia’s first
families.
But’ the biggest party the visitors
attended was the Empire Society’s annual
reception. They met the Governor and
Lady Game, and each woman guest
found a posy attached to her name-card
on the supper-table. Golden tulips
marked Lady Moore’s place. She, as a
descendant of Batman, is perhaps the
most important woman visitor. But Mrs.
Arnold Dixon is also among the
notables. Her family were the former
owners of Captain Cook’s cottage, and
she is to unlock its door at the centenary.
She’ll be glad when this is over, for the
key is a big responsibility and is always
on her mind even if it’s not in her hand-
bag. Mrs. Whittle and daughter Norah
are flower enthusiasts, and squeezed in
many visits to our Botanic Gardens.
Mrs. M. E. Halliday brought black lace
and tulle to the shivoo. The Caton
couple, now of Jersey but formerly of
Rhodesia, author Marshall Smith, Percy
Burrell, A. D. Mellish and the genial
G. A. H. Chapman were also among the
pointed-outs.
The Empire Society’s annual reception
revolved around Sir Philip and Lady
Game, who made their first public ap-
pearance since their return from Eng-
land, and the visiting members of the
Royal Empire Society of London. Lady
Game looked cool in blue-and-white chif-
fons, and the Governor boasted that he
hadn’t made a speech for five months—
“an enviable record, and I don’t want to
break it.” However, he did say a word
or two to the three little girls, winners
this year of the society’s prize essay
competition. President Kelso King and
his lady welcomed the guests ; her gown
of black matelasse had a swathe of tur-
quoise-blue crepe on the corsage. The
Mayoral lady lit up her black velvets
with silver bands. Olive King looked
well in vintage-red satins. Lieut.-Com-
mander Gifford had one of his hap-
piest smiles. The Roy Hendys and the
Frank Cranes were among the merry-
makers ; Mrs. F. W. Wheatley, Mrs. J.
W. Tattersfield and Mrs. McEvilly
Jordan were others noticed in the
crowded rooms.
The most important visitors to Sydney,
according to the children, are Sir Nevile
Wilkinson, who has brought Titania’s
Palace, his daughter Guendolen, now
grown-up and a Girl Guide, who did see
the fairy, and does still see them, for
she comes from Ireland, the home of the
little people. She cleans all the silver,
and there’s lots of it in the Palace. Sir
Nevile’s wife, Lady Beatrix Wilkinson,
made the fairy garden, full of trees,
flowers and green lawns. But she also
acts as charwoman to her Fairy Majesty,
and does all the washing. With 16
rooms, this is no light day’s work. As
one item there are the towels, with their
embroidered crowns and the fairy coat-
of-arms. The Wilkinsons are staying at
Government House, but soon 52
Macleay-street will house them.
On Thursday, Governor Phillip’s birth-
day, the city flew its flags. The Women
Pioneers flew theirs over the portrait of
the man that hangs above the mantel-
piece in their clubrooms. Members also
made a pilgrimage across the road into
the Gardens. Here, outside the rim of
the fountain basin that is the base of
the Phillip statue, Mrs. Lingham, the
president, read a short address, then
calmly walked the plank thrown across
the fountain basin and placed in posi-
tion the society’s wreath (on the same
day Mrs. Hope Johnson placed one on
the shrine in the tiny Church of St. Mil-
dred’s in Bread-street, London). The
wreath was tied up with the society's
colors, green, gold and black, and nest-
ling on the laurel leaves were five wara-
tahs. The minute of silence over, the
little company recrossed Macquarie-
street. Back in the rooms, gay with
waratahs, red geraniums, arum lilies and
blue cornflowers, the toasts were “The
King,” “Phillip” and “Our Ancestors.”
Between the
toast-drinking and
the informal
lunch, Captain
Clemens and an-
other visitor on the
way to the centen-
ary festivities, Mrs.
Dreaschfield, found
much to interest
them in the pictures
of landings and
foundings of the
various States and
in the rows of de-
lightful miniatures
of Australia’s earli-
est pioneers that
hang from slim
brars rods around
the walls.
By motor-car, by
ferry and by ’bus
they went, 2500 of
them, out to Manly
to see golf masters
Sarazen and Kirk-
wood. Manly’s
own Ferrier was
an attractive figure.
He was the tallest
player, and his
brown shirt, plus-
fours, socks and
shoes blended with
the shining brown-
ness of his hair
(“He makes me
think of a nice
smooth seal,” said
a woman in the
crowd). Kirkwood
could be easily
picked out by his royal-blue sweater,
He wore slacks, as also did Hat-
tersley, while Gene Sarazen, plump
and good-natured looking and much
shorter than any of the others, smiled
on everyone alike. In the excite-
ment of the game husbands forgot they
had brought wives and left them high
and dry. Boys got separated from their
best girls. The rushing from green to
green or from tee to tee the not-so-slim
non-golfer found good for her figure,
and the slim good for her appetite. But
Mrs. Sarazen sat quietly on the club's
balcony, and looked at as much of the
game as she could see through the secre-
tary’s glasses.
On Thursday the rain spoilt what was
to have been one of the social events of
the week. Only about 800 diehards
turned up to see the play at Rose Bay.
And again the most interested spectator
sat on the club’s verandah until the end
of the game.
Australia is the poorer through the
death of Dr. Dan Kelly, a great surgeon
and a true friend. Of late years cancer
research took up much of his time, and
the Mater Misericordiae Hospital at North
Sydney, which he had nursed from its
infancy, will miss his cheery presence
and skilful hand. He was a tall man,
and a companionable one, and apart from
his work he was as light-hearted as a
schoolboy. His wife was Mildred Coffee,
Frank Coffee’s daughter; she and three
sons, Kevin, Donald and Lincoln, are
left sorrowing.
Here is a George Johnston drawing
of Janet Thatcher, whose engagement to
Geoffrey Ashton put an extra bead on
the champagne cup of Race Week. Both
families are delighted, and when Mrs.
Jimmie rang up her husband in London
to tejl him his excitement over the glad
tidings nearly caused a breakdown in
the service. Janet comes from Double
Bay, and is the only chick of the F. W.
Thatchers. She rides and plays tennis,
but surfing is first favorite, with ski-ing
at Kosciusko a close second. She prefers
biographies to novels. At the end of the
week she goes oft to Melbourne for the
centenary. Geoff is the third son of the
James Ashtons, but lives at Markdale
with his polo-playing brothers.
The Orthodox Greek Church had a
distinguished congregation on Sunday.
The Governor came; with him M.L.
Gov.-Gen. Lord Bledisloe and Com-
mander Gifford. The Navy and the
Army sent figures in gold-braided uni-
forms, wearing decorations ; the Con-
suls of many nations attended in full
levee dress. The occasion was a requiem
mass for Alexander, King of the Yugo-
slavians, and Sydney’s Yugoslavs came
to pay their last obeisance to their ruler.
The catafalque, covered by a pall
over which the Serbian flag (red, white
and pale blue) flowed, stood below the
altar on the floor of the Cathedral. On
it were two large wreaths, and surround-
ing it lighted candles. Flanking the cata-
falque were Australia’s flag and the blue
and white of Greece. Seven little girls
in their blue-and-white school tunics and
seven small white-robed boys, a narrow
band of black on their white girdles,
kept watch on each side during the long
service. J , •
Archbishop Timotheos officiated, his
golden vestments rich with embroideries.
He wore his pectoral cross and his v*/.r
decorations. But for reading the Bible
he took off his golden crown, ablaze
with jewels, and put on the high
black priest’s headcovering, similar to
that of the assisting Archpriest
Nicolaides. During the service were
sung the Hymns for the Dead written by
the first Fathers of the Church. They
have come down unchanged through the
centuries.
Delysia is the talk of the town.
Packed from floor to ceiling was the
New Tivoli for the opening night of
“Mother of Pearl” ; not a vacant seat
anywhere. Everybody wore her best
dresses, her best jewellery, and added
orchids, tulips or lily-of-the-valley as a
decoration. Garlands of flowers and
drapings of Union Jacks and tricolors
intensified the enthusiasm. Between the
act's badged men in the foyer and the
vestibule said “She’s just as fascinating
as she was in T 7 and TB.”
There was an allure in Delysia’s pale-
pink-satin neglige with its clouds of tulle ;
romance in the black velvet with its
spreading skirts and period hat. But
audible was woman’s intake of breath
at sight of the deep, midnight-blue
sequinned gown. This fitted her like a
skin (with her figure foundation garments
aren’t necessary), and a flip of her heel
turned its train into a slinky snake or
an eddying pool of glowing blueness
about her feet.
Mrs. Oliver Osborne, the George
Walkers and Theo Marks sat together
in one box. Mrs. Thring wore orchids
with her vivid-green laces. Mrs. Toby
Brown’s tulips came from Binalong for
the occasion. Mrs. Robert Dixson’s
orchids most likely came from Elwatan’s
gardens. Mrs. Harold Vale’s crepes were
aquarelle-blue. Mrs. Sep Levy, the
Douglas Levys and the Pat Levys met in
the foyer. Kelso King’s lady wore black
laces. The Sam Horderns, Mrs. Ellis
Fielding Jones, Mrs. Spencer Brunton
and Mrs. Eva Wunderlich were notables
in the crowded house. Hera Roberts
wore a slim-sleeved cream lace coat
with her black lace skirt, and Ann
Rodgers invested black velvets with
distinction.
A big crowd welcomed Delysia to
Sydney, among them many Diggers who
had seen her during the war days. Some
brought flowers to the station, others had
them sent to her hotel. At the cocktail
party in the afternoon guests repeatedly
told her they had seen her, and where.
Delysia had been at Mrs. Jimmie Dixon’s
wedding, so it didn’t take the two of
them long to pick up the threads of their
old friendship.
The glamorous one’s slimness was
emphasised by her black cloth tailored
frock, with which she wore a jade-green
velvet scarf and hat. In evidence, too,
was the snake-like Arab anklet. Her
make-up is unusual. Her eybrows are
two slim lines that almost meet her hair.
She uses no powder, but her eyes are
smudged in with eye-blue. She is inter-
ested in people, loves the theatre, all the
luxurious and expensive things of life,
and all animals, but especially dogs. She
doesn’t do physical jerks, but she rides.
All this she tells the inquirer with a
friepd-making smile. Her bracelet, her
rings and her cigarette-case she handed
round to be looked at. They are made
of tiny mosaics of sparkling mirror.
Alice Nikitina, the dancer, gave her the
cigarette-case, complete with her name
and the message “You will see in this
mirror someone who is tremendously
dear to me” on the inside.
Dr. Bernardini, the Apostolic Delegate,
will open the All-Australian Fete at the
Town Hall on Saturday at 3 o’clock.
Money goes to the Cardinal Cerretti
memorial chapel and to charities.


Mebourne
Chatter
Lord Huntingfield opened the early-
Vic. show at 3 p.m., and at 4 p.m. he
took the lift to a lower floor in the Com-
monwealth Bank Building to open a loan
exhibition of paintings. The room was
so packed that if was almost impossible
to breathe and quite impossible to see
the pictures. One of the smartest people
present was Lady Anderson, wife of the
Orient Co.’s chairman, who stepped off
the mailboat that morning. Lady Ander-
son is tall and slim ; her white hair was
visible under the tulle crown of her
large black hat, worn with a black gown
patterned with floral sprays. Her daugh-
ter Hermione .wore her hair beautifully
curled, and in her ensemble successfully
combined aquarelle-blue with nut-brown.
Mrs. Russell Grimwade wore a white
camellia upon her brown coat. J. S.
Kenyon was there in a dignified frock
coat and Dr. Maloney in two pairs of
glasses, one on the bridge of his nose
and the other on the tip. John Longstaff
chatted with Captain Lawrence, who is
something of a connoisseur of pictures.
Lord Huntingfield, R. H. Croll and
Daryl Lindsay enjoyed a joke together.
Noticed also were Mrs. Webb Gilbert,
Mrs. Frank Andrew and Chancellor
MacFarland lingering near his portrait
by Longstaff.
Lady Huntingfield, who has been a
pillar of support to the Blue Triangle
Movement, came to a dance for the
Triangle funds at Fairholme, East St.
Kilda. Accompanying her were Lady
Bledisloe, wife of the Gov.-General of
M.L., wearing oleander-pink lace, match-
ing slippers and a white fox wrap from
which her fair head emerged. The Hon.
Sara Vanneck wore one of her favorite
shades of brown with a high neck and
crinkled cape. Mrs. Barry Thomson,
who organised the dance, was all ice-blue
for her lace dress and threequarter-
length chiffon coat. Mrs. Harold Clapp’s
black taffeta expanded into an exciting
bustle and a gold-fluted bib. Mrs. Edgar
Dye s black velvet was twinkly at the
neck and fur-winged upon the sleeves.
Mrs. James Roach hung a blue cape
upon her floral gown ; Win Kellow was
also floral clad, her dress running to a
square neck and a brief train. A present
from the committee to Lady Bledisloe
was a grandfather native bear. Lady
Huntingfield received a spotty tiger with
long whiskers, Miss Vanneck took home
two little black boys and the Fuller lady
a lion whose wiry mane looked fierce
next her silver fox.
With the visiting bridge players as its
nucleus, a cocktail party revolved at
Bndgehaven. Host Hugh Joske and Mrs.
Ken Rodda put a kick (which they called
Mae West) into pinky, foamy and very
cold drinks. Unbeaten champions N.S.W.
captain J. Griffiths and his partner Colin
Cadwallader looked like the youngest
people in the room. Mr. and Mrs. M.
M. Phillips were there. Mrs. Myra Mil-
hngen had an eye obliterated by a
naughty black hat. Tasmania’s skipper,
Miss Sale, wore a spotty blue frock. (The
game little Apple Isle by a misunder-
standing sent a team of women to com-
pete in open championships.) A Tasma-
nian player, Mrs. Claude Boag, wore furs
with a beige suit. Ballarat’s Mrs. Mitchell
wore a flattened brown hat with Persian-
green ; also in green were Vic. A-grade
pennant players Mrs. Hider-Smith and
Mrs. Eric Mish. Mrs. H. C. Nicholson
has no high and mighty ideas about
flowers ; she wore a pink geranium in
her lapel. Others present were Lionel
Jamieson ; Dr. Tonkin, who came late
and seemed partial to cherries; Mrs. J.
K. Johnston, already dressed in black
velvet, a white camellia and a wee black
hat for the evening skirmish (in the Syd-
ney women’s team); Mrs. Norman Mc-
Cance, in a brown tailored suit, and Mrs.
V. Chisholm, in dusty-pink and an Eton
crop.
Major and Mrs. Walter Berry invited
a* large number of their friends to wind
up Caulfield Guineas Day with cock-
tails. The hostess was very summery,
despite the. chill air of late afternoon,
in her chiffons patterned with sprigs
of green, gold and biscuit. The scent
and color of spring flowers made things
joyous in lounges and dining-room.
Among the guests were Mrs. Cleve
Pratt with Shirley and Valerie, Colonel
and Mrs. Morshead, the Frank Harpers,
Mr. and Mrs. H. Devine, the D G
Lumsdens and Isobel, Frank Stogdale
and Dr. and Mrs. John Down. Mollie
Moseley, who is spending a holiday
with Mrs. Berry in her Grange-road
home, wore a gay frock upon which
tones of lipstick-red predominated.
A committee of matrons is arranging
what promises to be a very well-organ-
ised dance in Earl’s Court to entertain
500 seamen from the visiting warships.
The matrons, under the auspices of the
A.N.A., have risen to the occasion purely
in the cause of hospitality. They have
no hankering for publicity, and are all
reputable citizens with a sympathy for
youth which is not so pronounced in
other and higher social circles. If the
500 invited maidens have enough sense
not to revolt against being chaperoned
they should have a jolly evening—though
the susceptible ones may suffer from
broken hearts when the warships steam
down Port Phillip.
The drooped shoulder line and simple
coiffure affected by the ladies of
the early-yictorian era are here shown
by Josephine,, only daughter of Mrs.
Percy Webster, of South Yarr<*. Miss
Webster’s name was one of those called
by (he very correct gentleman in side-
boards, spats, stock and pearl pin who
announced each demure young woman
who swept her hooped skirts upon the
dais on the opening day of the early-Vic.
exhibition. The Hon. Sara Vanneck
displayed a moss-green satin gown, a
Paisley shawl and a prim sun hat. Mrs.
H. Parbury’s headpiece was a black pill-
box with a saucy minx of a red feather.
Margaret Graham, in a swish-swish of
white muslin over her crinoline was one
of the girls who sold catalogues in the
main body of the hall. Miss Webster's
portrait is by Jack Cato.
For weeks there has been a stealthy
scratching round the roots of family
trees, for applicants who wished to repre-
sent pioneers at the Pioneer Ball had to
produce proof of an ancestor who settled
in Vic. before 1860. Settlers who in-
vested in pastoral leases and kept diaries
or were mentioned in the newspapers
made things easy for their descendants,
but adventurous spirits who dashed about
the country chasing bushrangers (or
practising that profession) and sowing a
wild oat or two have caused their off-
shoots some anxiety as to the soil which
nestles round the root of the family tree.
Lucius Conolly has disturbed some
dust in the Titles Office on his job of
checking applications of 50 families, but
all passed muster. At the rehearsals of
the pageant, quadrilles and polka crino-
lines were worn, though not the old-
world dresses, so that the space neces-
sary could be gauged. The ball revolves
to-night in the Melbourne Town Hall.
A long room in the Commonwealth
Bank Buildings woke up one morning
last week to find itself completely Vic-
torian. Wallpapers and wide skirting
boards put in specially for the exhibition
are of the type fashionable in the last
century and provide a suitable back-
ground for a series of rooms arranged
with the help of partitions. The King
and Queen showed their interest in the
Victoria League by making a present to
the people of this State of a needlework
panel depicting Queen Victoria’s pet dogs
and a macaw, and this has pride of
place. There are many lovely pieces of
furniture, Sheffield plate, china and
jewellery. What reflections of bobbing
curls and sparkling eyes are locked in
the memory of a silver dressing-table
mirror lent by Mrs. Treacy! A four-
poster bed hides under quilted coverings
(of modern material but in an old-
fashioned sprigged design), and at its
foot is a brass warming-pan. There are
numerous fire-screens, movable on their
stands or sliding along the mantelpiece
so that grandmamma could toast her
toes and keep the glare off her eyes.
An elaborate brass canary cage swings
above one of the drawing-rooms, a re-
minder of some little songster who lifted
up his voice as his mistress sang “Ben
Bolt.” There is a smuggler’s rum-bottle
—it makes a beautiful lamp—and among
the embroideries is the “iron hand ip
the velvet glove,” a whalebone waist-
restrictei covered with little bows and
biocade. A comical riding coat seems
to be made of the same material as an
ordinary striped mattress, and our flat
hats of to-day provide quite as much
head-covering as some ancient pimple
stiaws anchored with bows under the
chin.
Cook s cottage has taken shape in Fitz-
ioy Gardens. The high tin enclosure has
come down, the only protection now
being a fence of spiked iron pickets.
Those who have watched its growth are
hoping that the cottage will not be open
to the public, for it would probably
topple down after an invasion of several
hundred feet upon its narrow wooden
stairway. In the living-room-kitchen is
a pothook over a wrought-iron grate
where (so we are asked to believe) Mrs.
Cook boiled her kettle. Her oven (if
she had one) has disappeared. The
plaster behind has been smoked to a
turn by the reconstruction workmen boil-
ing their billies at smoko time—the. ori-
ginal plaster could not be preserved.
Judging by the height of the doors the
Cook family must have been short.
There is a cupboard-like room off the
kitchen, and upstairs one bedroom and
a room just big enough to hold a small
bed. Perhaps it was occupied by seafar-
ing James between his voyages. An
effort was made to preserve the creak in
the stairs, but it’s a temperamental board
and won’t always perform its trick.
The poor horse who lived in the Cook
stable (which is built in one with the cot-
tage) must have had a monotonous time,
for the door has no separate upper sec-
tion for him to Watch what went on in
the world without. The stable floor of
stone, brick and mud, brought out in
sections, has not lost its aged look in the
reconstruction. At the front door, which
is opened with an enormous key, there’s
a mounting-stone. Cottage flowers and
ivy have been coaxed to take root in the
garden.
Here is a photograph by Broothorn of
the Hon. Sara Vanneck, who, with her
parents, Lord and Lady Huntingfield, will
welcome the Duke of Gloucester to Gov-
ernment House on his arrival in Mel-
bourne. Miss Vanneck has made many
friends in Australia. She enjoys the pur-
suits of the younger folk and follows her
mother’s footsteps by taking an interest
ill welfare activities. When occasion
demands she can make a speech as well
as many an older and more experienced
orator.
Dr. Doris Gordon, of M.L., was guest
of honor one evening last week when
Dr. Roberta Donaldson gathered medi-
cal and other learned people to her
favorite club. Dr. Gordon is a gynae-
cologist, and came to Melbourne for a
special two weeks’ post-graduate course
at the Women’s Hospital. In 1927 a
Society of Obstetrics was formed in M.L.
for the purpose of getting enough money
to establish a chair of obstetrics at Otago
Uni. Dr. Gordon was assistant-secre-
tary, and the effort raised £31,000. At
the party the doctor gave an interesting
lecture upon her work. Hostess Dr.
Donaldson has just completed three
years as president of the Medical
Women’s Society.
“Die Fledermaus” is grand opera in
modern dress. Browning Mummery gets
up to the singing master’s pranks in larri-
kin shoes of brown and white, a beauti-
ful plum-brocade dressing-gown and a
giddy little fez. . Thea Philips as Rosa-
linda trails a blossom-pink and spring-
green neglige, is swathed in gold lame
with sleeves draped in fitch furs, and
claims her husband from a jolly-looking
gaol in a brown dress and threequarter-
length coat patterned with what looked
like broad arrows. Francesca Duret bobs
about in royal-blue, a blaze of silver in
the vicinity of the triangular porthole at
the back. Ethel Earl risks her lovely
while satin among puddles caused by the
gloriously inebriated governor of the
gaol (Booth Hitchen) turning glasses up-
side down. Gwladys Garside as the
prince possesses good square shoulders,
but cannot disguise her undulating curves
under men’s evening clothes. There’s a
comical servant in purple-and-orange
livery (conventional musical - comedy
attire which would do equally well for
a brigand) who performs antics with a
bottle of Madeira. Ben Williams sprays
his white tie, white camellia (plucked
from the mouth of an innocent boar’s
head) and long-tailed suit with eau-de-
Cologne before cutting prison and going
to a ball instead. “The Blue Danube”
is danced by eight girls in frills and frills
of powder-blue net.
Stars with a night off are always to
be seen in the right-hand boxes of the
Apollo. Enthroned opposite on Satur-
day night were Harold Luxton and his
lady, she in a squirrel cape. One of the
most striking figures in the circle was
Mrs. Alfred Fowler ; her white gown had
a slice of black velvet running crosswise
over the bodice. The J. Plottels were
there, she in a dyed ermine cape. Mrs.
Chilvers was handsome in a long coat of
Persian lamb; Mrs. W. Griffiths wore
lace of a rusty red, and Mrs. Riebusch
was followed by a train of black velvet,
with ermine pelts strung across the shoul-
ders. Mrs. Sam Harcourt’s green frock
wore an elongation of train, and Mrs. R.
H. Rickards mixed blue satin and, white
fur. Among the younger folk were Agnes
and Marion Thomas, one in a brown
cloak, the other lost in Arctic foxes, and
both wearing lily-of-the-valley. Mrs.
Leslie Benjamin wore a slim gown of
turquoise, and ermine tails bobbed upon
the cape of Clare Englander’s toe-length
black velvet coat.
Chancellor MacFarland conferred
honorary doctorates of Letters and Engi-
neering respectively on John Masefield
and Sir John Cadman, the ceremony
being concluded by a tea party for the
intelligentsia. The Poet Laureate and
Mrs. Masefield are guests of the Warden
of Trinity College and Mrs. Behan.
Melbourne people who returned from
foreign parts last week included the
Richard Turnbulls, with their son Mac-
kay (daughter Anne remains at school
in England); the J. I. Hendersons, with
their son and daughter ; Marie Langridge,
who is unpacking her trunks after two
years spent abroad ; and the A. C. White-
laws, who were met by their son Lionel
and his bride, who was Sheila Vincent.
St. Margaret’s headmistress, Miss D.
Gibson, has tales to tell about the P.E.N.
Club, which met this year in Edinburgh.
All nationalities are represented by its
4000 pen-pushing members. The club is
an outlet for young reactionaries, and is
a scrapping-ground where people with
the loudest voices have the best chance
of being heard.
Pat Wenzel was another homecomer
on the Otranto. She has brought an
extraordinary bracelet to which a globu-
lar ornament the size of an apricot is
attached. Such adornments reflect the
scenery fore and aft, a decided advantage
when somebody very dull and boring
is approaching from the rear or the cause
of the family feud takes an unexpected
diagonal turn across the street.
Priminister Lyons opened Chevron,
Melbourne’s newest hotel, with a cere-
mony round it's swimming-pool. He and
T. JJastie spoke of monuments of pro-
gress, and a troupe of swimmers and
divers (international, Australian and
Vic. champions) made “pool records”
and christened the onlookers with their
splash. In her freak swimming display
Lola Scott did strange things like sewing
under water, figure eights, duck and sub-
marine-diving. After the building had
been inspected afternoon-tea was served
in the dining-room.
Mrs. Monckton Synnot and her daugh-
ter Patricia have arrived from Eskdale,
Corfield (Q.), to have a look at the way
Melbourne celebrates its centenary. To
welcome her friends Sheila Creswick and
Mary and Jean York Syme, who have
lately returned from abroad, Miss Syn-
not gave a luncheon party at the Alex-
andra Club.. Guests were directed round
a flower-strewn table by the hostess, who
wore a citron-shaded suit and a touch
of white near the throat and the shallow
crown of her hat. Sheila Creswick and
Mary Syme paid respects to the wintry
day with navy-blue suits, and Jean Syme
was all brown and cocoa fox furs.
Rivalling the “lollysticks” which are
making Melbourne look like a huge
giggle-park are the decorations of the
Town Hall. Never a very beautiful piece
of architecture at any time, it is now dis-
figured by clusters of what seem to be
cocoanuts strung along every line of the
building. Melbourne can now indeed
boast that it possesses a Town Hall “with
knobs on.”

Why this
STOMACH
REMEDY,
always succeeds
In order to make a complete recovery
from Indigestion, Gastritis or Stomach
Ulcer your treatment must reach the
root cause of the mischief. It is because
* Bisurated ’ Magnesia does this with
amazing efficacy that it has held the field
for over 20 years as the supreme remedy
for stomach troubles. There arethousands
of men and women who have enjoyed
good digestion for years simply through
the restorative power of ‘ Bisurated ’
Magnesia.
GASTRITIS ended after
29 years.
Mr. H. P. Martin, Corn &
Seed Stores, High Street,
Kelvedon, Essex, writes
*'l have suffered with gas-
tritis for the last 29 years
and have had two opera-
tions and been in 5 hospitals
. . . Seeing your advertise-
ment for ‘Bisurated’
Magnesia I bought a bottle
and am pleased to tell you
I got free from pain almost
at once ... I can eat my
food without fear of pain
and am better in health
than I have been since I
was 20 years of age.”

‘Bisurated’ Magnesia
BROUGHT INSTANT RELIEF I
Mr. Bulman.of Hull writes:—
“My -wife suffered stomach
trouble for fifteen years, tried
nearly everything possible
without relief until she tried
'Bisurated’ Magnesia which
worked wonders. There is
nothing to beat it, and after 1
what I have seen her suffer,
absolutely prostrated with,
pain, I think it my duty to
sufferers to let them know
of your wonderful remedy.
Advice to Sufferers.
Perhaps you are even now dreading
your next meal. Then why not make it
the occasion for putting ‘ Bisurated
Magnesia to the test ? Get a bottle of
‘Bisurated’ Magnesia, powder or tablets,
from your chemist and take a little after
your meal. Eat what you fancy. The
result will be a revelation to you. The
customary pain and wind will not occur
and digestion will be completed with
ease and comfort. ,

Diana and Rosemary Cooke are being
introduced to young Melbourne at such
a rate that they are finding it difficult to
sort out faces and names. Their cousin
Judith Burston gave a dance in their
honor at her Toorak home, where lounge,
hall and closed-in verandah were deco-
rated with gorgeous flowers. The hostess
performed introductions in loquat-
yellow ninon, and her sister Erica was
frilly in patterned crepe, the reds in the
design being repeated by a halo band
of buds and berries. Diana and Rose-
mary, who are both slim brunettes, chose
different shades of blue for their frocks,
and their mother’s lace gown was blue in
yet another toning. Adelaide visitor Mrs.
Guy Lendon wore swamp-green satin out
of which sprang a bunch of lily-of-the-
valley. Hilary Hay’s dress was of a more
pronounced green. Alison McArthur
and Alison Dalrymple had similar ideas
about black for the backgrounds of their
swishing taffetas. Stripes in several colors
ran diagonal races up and down Suzanne
Reddiford’s satin crepe.
Among the gorgeous new materials
being stitched in expensive dress salons
is a silky weave for evening wear striped
with narrow velvet ribs. Other stuffs
show metal stripes of varying thicknesses,
and some intricate weaves have a silken
background which rises in blisters among
little pools of silver or gold. There is
less fur around the collars of evening
coats, which are usually threequarter-
length or else dragging the floor in a train.
Trains on evening dress have had their
wild impulses clipped closer to the heels.
To trim day clothes buttons are being
made of bamboo with gilt edges as a
change from chromium, and of cork,
which is highly successful cut in flat
squares with streaks of gilt near the
corners.
The carriage to be used to transport
royalty per rail is undergoing a course
of beauty treatment at North Melbourne.
It is the State Governor’s car, was built
20 years ago, is 71ft. long and is com-
fortable if not luxurious. If he’s so
minded the Duke may dodge the dining-
car, for there’s a complete kitchen next
door to his lounge-smokeroom. His
sleeping apartment contains two beds,
each with a limy-green cover of taffeta
brocade. There are presentable ward-
robes and mirrors, and the car runs to
two bathrooms. A person of moderate
size may sit in the bath quite comfort-
ably, and his head would clear the
shower with an inch or two to spare.
Sally Ann is up on her perch, and
doesn’t intend to come off it until after
this year’s frisks. She will parade on the
Henley lawns in her starched muslins,
she’ll visit at least one warship and will
stand for hours waiting for a glimpse of
perhaps a horse’s mane as the royal pro-
cession files past. Sally Ann can afford
to snap her fingers at the “Situations
Vacant” in the daily papers. She’s saved
her wages for months, and her bloom
of youth may be wilted by the time
another royal personage visits these
shores. A woman in Hawthorn adver-
tising for a parlormaid at 35/- got one
reply; another who offered £2/5/- for
a cook has persuaded her husband to
eat at his club. A Malvern ad. for a
housemaid at 37/6 was totally ignored.
After a trial which lasted into the sixth
day, Mrs. Fowler was found not guilty
of the murder of an old man at Barry
(N.S.W.).
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The sun shone brightly on the arrival
of the Duke of Gloucester. Huge crowds
lined the streets and cheered him on his
arrival at the Town Hall; a civic wel-
come was tendered to him on the dais
outside. The Duke’s reply was brief
but very clear.
In the afternoon the Duke went to
the Show accompanied by the Governor
and Lady Dugan with their staffs—
quite a large party. In the evening there
was a dinner party at Government
House, a big affair to which Govern-
ment officials and their wives and Rear-
Admiral W. T. R. Ford and the captains
of the visiting squadron were invited.
The whole party afterwards went' on to
the Lud Mayor’s Ball in the Town Hall,
where about' 1500 were present. The
huge organ was concealed behind an
ancient castle with battlements and an
immense gate in the centre. On either
side the organ galleries were hidden by
a forest of palms, and in front on the
stage a garden of gorgeous real flowers
and flowering Judas trees looked quite
realistic. Mrs. Frank Harcus designed
the decorations.
The Duke was received downstairs by
Lord Mayor Cain and the Acting-Mayor-
ess (Mrs. H. Dunstan), whose pale-blue
satin with a fine silver stripe ended in a
train. H.R.H. was escorted to the dais,
decorated as a bower of roses. Others
in the royal party had arrived before
him. Lady Dugan was frocked in black
lace cut on slim lines with diamond
ornaments. Miss Murray, sister of the
Chief Justice, chose amethyst lace. Mrs.
R. L. Butler wore black lace, and her
pretty daughter Jean danced in white
satin with white camellias down the back
of the bodice. Mrs. George Ritchie’s
emerald-green marocain had white
flowers on the corsage.
The country people in the city got an
eyeful of the Grenadier Guards’ Band
in all its glory. It's arrival caused great
excitement.
Owing to some mistake on the night
of the Government House dinner and
ball, the naval and military men were
under the impression that uniforms were
to be worn, whereas ordinary evening
dress was decreed. As a consequence
several stranded wives waited in the
foyer for husbands who had dashed
home to change.
On Saturday morning the Duke
attended the Adelaide oval, where over
8000 Boy Scouts and Girl Guides gave
him a rousing reception and Cubmaster
A. A. Barber, of Renmark, received the
Scout Gold Medal of Merit. H.R.H.,
who wore a grey lounge suit, departed in
an open car, smilingly acknowledging the
tremendous cheering on all sides.
Immediately after luncheon Keith
Minchin arrived at Government House
with two koalas, Oswald and Gertrude,
with their six-weeks-old baby Percy. The
Prince had expressed a desire to see them.
Mr. Minchin took 100 feet of film.
An unrehearsed incident was supplied
by Gertrude. While the Duke was
feeding Oswald with gum leaves she
raced off with her baby on her back and
commenced to scramble up a large tree
on the lawn. She was captured by the
detective-inspector from Scotland Yard
about three feet up the trunk.
Later in the afternoon the Duke
played polo at Birkalla with members
of the Adelaide Polo Club. He cap-
tained his own team, which included
Captain Arthur Curtis, Frank Downe-
and Cecil Bray. They played triangular
matches with the A and B teams selected
to represent the State at the Centenary
Games. H.R.H. rode F. W. Porter’s
Phil, R. P. Teesdale Smith’s Sesame and
E. W. Hayward’s Ruddle. He played
a hard-riding, vigorous game, taking part
in six chukkas and scoring three goals.
There were many amateur photo-
graphers in the members’ stand, and the
two schoolgirl daughters of Mr. and
Mrs. Frank Young were thrilled when
H.R.H. posed for them with a smile.
The whole affair was informal. The
Duke sat on the steps of the dressing-
shed between chukkas chatting with
T. E. Barr Smith.
In the evening, with the members of
his staff, the Prince attended the Citizens’
Committee Ball at the Town Hall, given
to entertain the officers of the visiting
warships. After being received, the Duke
went out on to the balcony and waved
to the crowd, who responded to Lud
Mayor Cain’s call for three cheers.
The Regimental Ball of the 43/48
Battalion was a cheery affair held at
the Embassy. Uniforms were as gay as
frocks, and small parties, preceded by a
dinner, were the order of the day. The
ballroom was decorated with flags, and
supper was served in cabaret style at
small tables around the room. Lud
Mayor Cain was present; Mrs. J. M. A.
Durrant danced in wine-toned wind-
swept velvet, with beige lace corsage;
Mrs. Roy Burston chose shell-pink satin
fitting to the figure ; Mrs. W. Fowler-
Brownsworth, almond-green flat crepe ;
Mrs. D. V. J. Blake, russet-red marocain
cut on long lines. Mrs. Gregory Bruer’s
sea-green windswept satin was caught on
the shoulder with diamente clips.
WESTRALIA.
Five hundred pairs of feet took the
floor at the Weld Club, which stands in
need of a house-full sign when 350
souls have crossed the threshold. The
crush cramped the style but not the en-
thusiasm of the dancers, and the ball
went on for a couple of hours after
scheduled time. North- and south-west-
ers were there in full force ; the Ernest
Chenerys came from Dirk Hartog Island
(her royal-blue matelass£ trailed the
floor); the C. J. Phillipses were there with
daughters Pat and Helen ; Carnarvon’s
Mrs. Harry Calder wound a length of
mustard armure from chin to toe ; Mrs.
Henry Cooke’s weblike black laces were
finely, spun ; and Judy Clarkson strapped
green velvet crosswise over her black
Chantillies.
Karrinyup Country Club was massed
with daffodils for its Show Week dance,
and warmed the chill of the wind with a
huge log fire. Mrs. Gilbert Elliot was
there, swinging black floral georgettes ;
Mrs. Rex Norrie clasped diamente at the
bottom of her black armure; Molly
Arundle glittered a chromium girdle on
green lace ; Mrs. Lindsay Male’s white
taffetas swished a circular train; the
Stan Brearleys were in the throng, the
Walter Saws, the John Rogers, the
Meachems and the Craigs.
Two country lasses announce their en-
gagements to men far distant. Erica
Patterson, of Pinjarra, is off this month
to become Mrs. Stewart Douglas, and
Corry Bunbury, of Busselton, has
promised her heart and hand to John
Coote, of Berwick (Vic.).
TASMANIA.
The Naval and Military Ball of Laun-
ceston’s Show Week was quite a cheery
affair at the Albert Hall. The Governor
was there, but his lady was down with
the ’flu. In the v.-r. party were the
Military Commandant, Col. Whitham,
and the Mayor and Mayoress.
Launceston Grammar School’s dance
was staged in the Albert Hall, and was
a well-run affair. ’Flu had upset the
arrangements for fancy sets somewhat,
but only the organisers knew that. The
head and Mrs. Adams received the
guests with Miss R. Richardson, Mrs.
Hare and Mrs. Dougharty, brass-hats of
the organising committee. Lounges were
prettily furnished and decorated under
the long gallery, and the stage was
turned into a comfy drawing-room with
easy-chairs and attractive flower decora-
tions in big brass bowls.
Jean Ewart celebrated her 21st birthday
with a party for young things at the
Imperial, Hobart, where the lounge was
decorated with spring flowers and a big
log-fire kept the cold at bay. The
hostess’s frock of ivory ring velvet was
worn with a short coat of blue moire
velvet.
Mrs. Hugh Armstrong gave Mrs. W.
W. Giblin’s friends an opportunity to
welcome her home from Africa at the
Queen Mary Club. The tea-tables and
the reception-room were done with pale-
salmon amaryllis and maple foliage.
Mrs. Armstrong, in black and beige,
stood with the guest of honor to receive
everybody. Mrs. Giblin’s suit of grey
soft woollens had a wide scarlet belt
under its pouched bodice, and was worn
with a wide flat white collar and a low-
crowned black-and-white hat.
Margaret Bennell and John Watson
were made one at St. Andrew’s, Launces-
ton. Bridegroom’s forebears came to
Australia in very early days, and gave
their name to Watson’s Bay, Sydney,
where they settled. The bride’s frock was
of needle-run parchment lace. Her little
cape was fastened with a spray of
orange-blossom (worn by her mother at
her wedding), and her wide-brimmed hat
had a spray of velvet blooms. The
bridegroom’s gift was a bracelet which
once belonged to Marie Antoinette, and
which has been in his family for gener-
ations. Joyce Mason, the bride’s cousin,
’maided in coral-red crepe with hat to
match.
Olga Heathorn and Len Nettlefold
were married at St. Clement’s, Kings-
ton. The bride’s dress of white heavy
satin was cut on long straight lines. to
the knees and then flared into a long
train. The tulle veil fell from a wreath
of orange-blossom round a cap effect of
tulle. Bridegroom’s sister Molly ’maided
in white lace with a sash tied in a big
bow at the back and a halo- of white
hyacinths. Two small train-bearers wore
long white organdie and silver frocks,
with haloes of white daisies and orange-
blossom. Mr. and Mrs. Heathorn after-
wards entertained guests at the clubhouse
on the links.
Zelda, third daughter of the late E. O.
and Mrs. Bisdee, Lorely Banks, Melton
Mowbray, and George Dick, son of the
late Ronald and Mrs. Dick, Sandy Bay,
have announced their engagement.
Ciceley Shoobridge, taking under wing
Dorothy Pixley, is off for a trip to India,
where she will stay with her sister, Mrs.
Birch, at Calcutta most of the time.

Whitewashing the Singleton.
BY
DR H.L. TONKIN
Some years ago one often heard some-
body ranked as a very poor player on
the ground that “he leads singletons.”
How opinion has changed!
Don’t run off with the idea that the
possession of a singleton makes it im-
perative to lead it. But the improvement
in modern bidding and play has led to
its being recognised that the singleton,
led under proper conditions, is often the
only lead to set a contract.
The late Dr. McAdam once wrote an
entertaining and informative article en-
titled “The Singularity of Singletons.”
He delved into the works of all the
bridge masters, collecting opinions for
and against this lead. Some condemned
it out of hand ; others were just as en-
thusiastic over its possibilities, but
neither produced much evidence to sup-
port their say-so. Mr. Sidney Lenz said :
“The idea that it is a lead shunned by
all good players is quite erroneous. With
hands of the proper type, it is at times
not only the correct lead but, in fact, the
only lead.”
Dr. McAdam himself was convinced,
as the result of his researches and experi-
ence, that if the lead were made judi-
ciously it should prove a most valuable
defensive measure. He added that its
employment should be a matter of re-
cognition and not of guesswork.
Mr. J. R. Adams, in his textbook
“Defence at Auction Bridge,” gives the
correct conditions for making the lead.
The leader should hold one more trump
than is required to stop that suit, he
should have some indication that he can
put his partner in to return his singleton
lead if the first trick is lost to his side,
and he must have a partner who will
understand the lead. The writer gives
two hands to illustrate these points.
Here is the first:
West bid and rebid the diamonds, and
was supported by East; the contract
went eventually to South at four hearts
doubled. As may be seen, any lead ex-
cept the singleton club allows South to
make his contract. The point is, how-
ever, that West has the ideal hand for
making the lead. He can stop the trumps,
and if the opening trick is lost, he is
fairly certain that he can put his partner
in later to return his shortage. That
brings us again to the other condition
emphasised by Dr. McAdam. If two
players have bid and supported a suit,
and one of them opens another suit at
trick one, that card is almost certainly a
singleton. Another thing to be driven
home is this. If West opens his singleton
club, no matter what card North puts
up, East should play low. With nine
clubs in sight, and the fact that he can
place his partner with at least five
diamonds, and probably four hearts, the
club must be from a shortage; hence
no good can come of playing his queen.
The next hand illustrates this even better,
although it is not a good example of a
holding from which to lead a single-
ton : —
South, playing auction, bid three
spades, and West opened with his lone
nine of hearts. North (dummy) put up
the ten, and East, quite wrongly, covered
with the queen. With 11 hearts in sight,
the opening nine is either a singleton or a
doubleton. This means that South has
ace and another or ace bare, and no pos-
sible good can come of playing the
queen. Although the single heart lead,
with intelligent co-operation, can defeat
the contract, the opening of the long
club suit, as Adams points out, can set
it two tricks. East must be careful,
however, to keep his small club to get
out with, after being put in the lead with
the diamond or heart.
Defence Against Bluff Bids.
The problem of defence against psychic
bidders has often been discussed.
Various overcalls and doubles have been
suggested, without providing a satis-
factory solution. In Melbourne, it has
been proposed that a special signifi-
cance should be attached to the call of
one no-trump over any opposition suit
bid. Up to lately that bid has been used
as a sort of interference by one who may
hold no stopper in the opponents’ suit,
but is provided with an escape suit, in
case of a double. In good company,
however, the bid is no longer of much
use. The opposition is frequently able
to pick the escape suit from its own
distributions, and go on to bid game or
slam, as if the no-trump had never been
called.
It is now suggested that this one no-
trump overbid should be used to cope
with the psychic bidder. For instance, if
North deals and passes, East passes and
South (third in hand, the most favorable
position for a bluff opening) says one
club. West should bid one no-trump with
the following meaning: My hand con-
tains about two and a half honor tricks :
I think this club bid is a psyche, be-
cause it is the call I would have made
myself. This may prove useful after a
trial in practice ; at least it shows that j
the bluff bidder is causing the more staid !
and mathematical players a great deal !
of worry. My own belief is that the best
defence of all is mutual partnership con-
fidence. If your partner bids, trust him
until you have reason to do otherwise.
If he supports your call over an opposi-
tion bid, go to your limit just as if the
opponents had passed. That is, believe
your partner in preference to the oppo-
sition. It is not that I think the bluff bid
has no place in the game. No first-class
player can afford to be honest all the
time. But the trouble with most psychic
addicts is that they will pick up hanc,
after hand which permits of a logical
constructive call, and go to any lengths
to avoid bidding it honestly. Therein lies
their weakness.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
P.M. (Parkes, N.S.W.). —The writer
you mention is very entertaining, but I
think that his theories are unsound in
practice, so I cannot advise you to follow
them. It Would be far more profitable
if you put in your time studying the
works of Culbertson and Sims.
“Misdeal” (Toowoomba, Q.). —The
four-five no-trump bid is used by prac-
tically all the best players in Sydney. It
is not so much that it makes slam-bid-
ding easier, but it is definitely of service
in preventing a pair contracting for r
losing grand slam. As far as the little
slam is concerned, I think that, apart from
freaks, there is never more than one
ace missing, and losing little slams are
bid by pairs who fail to take distribu-
tion into account.
T.S. (Willoughby, N.S.W.).—You seem
to be at the awkward stage which a
number of contract players pass through.
It is ridiculous to say that you cannot get
a partner to suit your game, and hence
do badly. Get lessons from a good
teacher, or persuade some experienced
player to watch your game, and you will
learn some of your own weaknesses.

READ WHAT THIS WONDERFUL
TONIC FOOD DID FOR OTHERS
Think what it can do for you and yours!
A DOCTOR SAYS
“I have some very nice things to
say about Roboleine. It is the
finest preparation I have come
across. I had a case recently of an
infant who was declining rapidly.
They tried everything at the Clinic
with no avail. All I did was to
cut down his .feed and put him on
Roboleine. He picked up almost
immediately and has never looked
back since. I shall be delighted
to recommend wherever possible.”
A NURSE SAYS
“I feel I must write and tell you of
the wonderful results obtained from
Hoboleine in the case of a child of
4 years suffering- from very severe
kidney trouble. When I took charge
of her after leaving the hospital,
she could not walk or keep any food
down. She had absolutely no flesh
on her bones and her skin was a
pale yellow. After 2 weeks on
Roboleine she had gained in weight
and her appetite had greatly im-
proved. Now, 8 weeks later, she is
a strong, healthy child, firmly and
well covered and is soon to com-
mence school.”
The secret of Roboleine’s success is the RED and YELLOW BONE
MARROW that it contains, together with “VITAD”, which is the
essence of cod liver oil without the nauseating taste. Combined in
a special way with other of Nature’s own body-building foods such as
“CREAM OF MALT”, EGG YOLK and LEMON JUICE, the MARROW
and “VITAD” put Roboleine in a class of its own. There can be no
substitute for Roboleine. Only small doses of this delicious food are
required to achieve the remarkable results described above, so that it
is very economical in use.

A Severe Study of This Incurable Complaint: —
FISHERMAN'S HAND
BY CLAODE CATFISH.
Boat, Beer, etc.,
by Scorfield.
44 T NOTICE,” said Snodge, throwing
I another bottle into the harbor,
A “that they’re putting pylons up on
that bridge near Flinders-street railway
station in Melbourne as part of the wel-
come to the Duke. What,” staring at
me as if I had anything to do with it,
“are they going to do here ?”
“Well,” I suggested, “what better could
they do here than take the pylons down?”
“I was read-
ing,” Snodge con-
tinued, “how a
cure has been
discovered for
surfer’s ear.”
“I’m glad to
hear it,” I said.
“I was dumped
myself once down
there. You know
those seas that
crash on to St.
Kilda beach”
“Did you ever
hear about fisher-
man’s hand?”
Snodge interrupted
Snodge.
“What the devil has that got to do with
the Harbor Bridge, or surfer’s ear,
either?” I asked.
“Nothin’,” said Snodge, “except that
you might be able to cure things like
them, but you can’t cure it. Did I ever
tell you about the bloke that wanted to
eat the bait?”
1 DECLINED to answer. The boat was
anchored. A zephyr laden with a kind
of myrrh and frankincense wafted over
us from the Woolloomooloo waterfront.
A distant swell of sound came softly to
us from the direction of the Zoo. I
made my back comfortable against a
rowlock, and took an oath never to
bring more than eight bottles with us
again—anything over that and Snodge
seems to get talkative.
“There’s no doubt,” he proceeded,
using the gunwale as an opener, “they
run in all shapes. Take yourself, for
instance. Who’d think to look at you
now that I met your wife in Pitt-
street on Friday?”
“Listen,” I said savagely, “if you’ve
got to say something, for God’s sake say
it. This is a boat. We’re supposed to
be fishing. What the hell has Douglas
Credit got to do with it?”
“Douglas Credit?” said Snodge. “I’m.
not talking Douglas Credit.”
“Well, you sound damn like it,” I
said. “Anyhow, you met my wife in
Pitt-street on Friday?”
“That’s the idea,” Snodge agreed. “I
met your wife in Pitt-street and I said
to her, ‘Are you looking for Claude?
There he is,’ I said, pointing to where
you were bowling along ahead. ‘The
bloke with the suit on. You can tell
him anywhere.’ ‘Yes,’ your wife said,
‘you can tell him anywhere, all right,
and you can tell him nothing.’ ”
“What about the bloke that wanted to
eat the bait?” I asked.
“I’m coming to him,” said Snodge.
“As I was saying, they run in all shapes.
Who’d think to look at you now that
you were that sartorial vision of Pitt-
street?”
“What,” I asked savagely, “what-
about-the-b 1 o k e-that-wanted-to-eat-the-
bait?”
“This about him,” said Snodge. “When
I met him I picked him for a fisherman,
because he looked the dead spit of what
you look like now —a sort of a cross
between a mangy
dingo and one of Jack
Lang’s starving bank-
ers. Fish,” Snodge
pro ceeded, thought-
fully ; “fish ; it’s mar-
vellous how fish
affects the human
mind. There’s coves
I’ve seen whipping the
New England trout
streams that you
might say fish affects
in a noble way. By
the look of them I
should say they get
themselves all rigged
out in their kit-and-
tackle in the morning
and then they have
someone varnish them,
kit and all.
“ ‘Did you ever hear about fisher-
man’s hand?’”
“You’ve heard,” said Snodge,
“Peter Dawson singing about the
fishermen of England? Well, when
I was over there I watched them at
it. They were fishing off the pier
at Brighton for sole, dressed to
the nines, every bloke with a towel
and washbasin behind him, and a
little bell on the tip of their rods
to tell ’em when they had a sole on.
“Beautiful,” said Snodge. “Beautiful!
That’s how fish affects some people. It
uplifts. Now take yourself.”
“Damn myself!” I shouted, “What-
abouttheblokethatatethebait? ”
“.... using the gunwale.
UUJELL, as I was saying,” said Snodge,
Tv “we’d got a couple of miles down
the river when I sung out to him above
the nojse of the engine:
“ T say,’ I shouted, ‘did you bring the
bait?’
“ ‘Bait?’ he says.
“ ‘Yes,’ I says, ‘bait. B-a-flaming-i-t,
bait! ’
“ ‘No,’ he says, ‘no, I didn’t bring the
bait. I thought you had it.’
“ ‘Thought! ’ I says. ‘You know what
Thought done?’
“After that we shut up. Fishermen, I
was thinking to myself, they run in all
shapes, but, by cripes, I’d have sworn he
was one! So would anybody. I’d met
him more or less by
accident while I was
waiting in the Prince
of Wales for the
time the Hawkesbury
train was due to
start, and anyhow we
ended up arranging to
go together. I asked
him if he was a fisher-
man, and he said he’d
done plenty of it in
his time up on the
Rivers. He was, too
—of a kind.”
C NODGE picked out
>3 a clear place in
the sky, and drank.
“Well,” he said, “we
sat on the bank all
Saturday night, with
the bream poking faces at us and gigging
us about leaving the bait in the train, and
when Sunday morning came the flaming
leatherheads started hopping about in the
trees singing out, ‘Got tackle, got your
tackle ?’ Have you ever heard ’em?
‘Got tackle, got tackle, got your tackle ?’
that’s what they sing out.
“It' takes something to get me,”
Snodge boasted, “but by the suffering
frost I bit at that. I up and yelled at ’em:
“ ‘Come down here and I’ll tackle
you! Call yourselves birds! Why,
strike me pink, me old woman’s hat could
fly the blasted socks off you!’
“I felt a bit better after that,” Snodge
went on, “and I was going to have a
friendly word to the other bloke —we
hadn’t spoken for nearly sixteen hours
by then —I was sort of going to make it
up to him, when just as I’d finished
apostrophising the blasted birds damn
me if a flaming great gull doesn’t swoop
down in front of me very eyes and pick
a fish out of the water as big as a
blasted dog.
“Well, I went berserk. I started to
jump up and down like an intoxicated
goat, and when the flaming gull spread
his wings and sailed over me head I
yelled at him, ‘Who the hell do you
think you are? Smithy?’
“It just shows you,” said Snodge, “the
effect the sight of fish can have on a
man. Anyway, I’d overlooked that this
other bloke’s name was Smith, and he
thought I was talking about him. He
“ ‘Damn myself!’ ”
gets up and comes over, with his right
sleeve flapping about in the breeze. I
told you, didn’t I, he had his right hand
off? That’s what I was coming to —
fisherman’s hand. I tell you they can’t
cure it.”
«THANKS,” I said. “Damn interest-
-1 ing. We’ll have to be doing a
break in another ten minutes or so;
there’s only three bottles left.”
“As I was saying,” said Snodge, open-
ing one, “the bloke comes over. The
sun was just starting to go down over
the hills with a sneer on its face, and
we’d wasted a damn good week-end. But
this bloke come over —they seem to
breed ’em like that up on the Rivers —

he just come over and said as if nothing
had happened, ‘Don’t you think we’d
better soon be eating them prawns?’
“Prawns? What prawns?” I said.
‘“The ones I’ve got in me bag,” he
says, and he opened it up and fished
them out, two pounds of them, starting
to turn red.
“ ‘Why, strike me purple,’ I bellowed,
‘they’re the blasted bait!’
“‘Bait?’ he says, ‘bait? What d’yer
mean, bait? Them things won’t go off!’
“Well, then, I took a tumble to him.
“ ‘Where did you say you done your

“ ‘Up on the Northern Rivers,’ he says.
“ ‘I don’t suppose,’ I says, ‘there’s any

A Penetrating, Vibrant Brevity: —
THE BITTER FRUIT
BY
JESSICA
NHEIL.
Sniffy was an
angel now, so the
lady from the mis-
sion said.
Funny about
Sniffy being an
angel.
UQ UCH a sweet idea, 5 ' sighed Mrs.
Davis over the fence, “for his
little playmates to carry him to his
last resting-place. So fitting, somehow.”
That’s what I think,” Mrs. Morrison
agreed heavily, “and it seems specially
right that my George should be one. He
and Bertie were such close friends. And
in death they were not divided,” she fin-
ished ambiguously.
Mrs. Davis planted her elbows more
firmly over the palings. Her face hung
over the fence like a lugubrious moon.
“Beautiful wreaths they’re sending to
the house. Bertie looks like a angel,
lying there so peaceful with the flowers
all round him. Dear little chap. How
we’ll miss him.”
Mrs. Morrison gave a sympathetic
moan.
“I’ll miss him as much as anyone. He
was always around here with his bright,
happy little ways. It did your heart good
to see him.”
Neither recalled the times Mrs. Mor-
rison had yelled across the street to
Bertie’s mother to keep her dirty brats in
her own yard. In the orgy of sentiment
in which they revelled, all else was for-
gotten.
IN his own private domain, a tumble-
* down toolshed and storehouse of un-
wanted household goods, George pon-
dered about Sniffy. Funny about Sniffy
being dead. Funny. When his mother,
her voice unctuously gentle, had said,
“Poor little Bertie is dead, dear,” he had
demanded suspiciously, “Bertie who?”
Funny about them all calling him
Bertie. Nobody called him Bertie ex-
cept the teacher.
Dead. What did it feel like to be
dead? George stiffened himself and
closed his eyes, but it was no use. He
couldn’t imagine himself dead, and yet
Sniffy was dead. He and Sniffy had been
talking together only a few minutes be-
fore Sniffy had gone up the street and
had run in front of the tram.
George felt a vague lingering regret
that he hadn’t seen the accident. He
remembered one he had seen. A beaut
car smash ; blood and broken glass every-
where, and a man who swore terribly..
Sniffy knew some beaut swears. He and
George practised them often.
George thought about the dead things
he had seen, dogs, cats, birds, a horse
once, stiff, with legs outstretched and star-
ing eyes. Would Sniffy be like that?
George looked at the spiral marks on
his hands where he had pressed them into
the old wire-mattress on which he sat. He
and Sniffy had once stripped themselves
and rolled on it until they were patterned
like the pictures of the Maoris in the
teacher’s history book. Sniffy had better
marks because he was fatter. And Sniffy
was an angel now, so the lady from the
mission said.
Funny about Sniffy being an angel.
heard with a thrill of im-
portance the news that he was to be
one of Sniffy’s pall-bearers. He knew
what pall-bearers did. He and Sniffy had
watched them often
from the vantage point
of the cemetery fence.
On the morning of
the funeral George
went to school. His
mother had given him
permission to stay away, but he couldn’t
resist the opportunity of impressing
the other fellows. The teacher was
extra kind and gentle to him, so he as-
sumed the air of melancholy that she
seemed to expect. Out in the playground
he swaggered a little and surrounded him-
self with magnificent mystery. He was
(he most important figure since Plugger
Jones came back from the reformatory.
The other fellows were frankly envious.
The headmaster had refused to allow the
children to march to the cemetery. They
could line the road as the cortege passed
the school, but he would not have the
minds of young children harrowed.
George had heard his mother telling
Mrs. Davis about it. He had no notion
what the words meant, but to repeat them
increased his own sense of superiority.
/"JEORGE dressed carefully in the
, afternoon. His socks were new,
with the tops turned in so the colored
part would not show; his boots were
polished as never before.
The lady from the mission had decreed
that they should wear black trousers and
white blouses with black armbands.
"White for the pure childish spirit that
has left us,” she said piously, and re-
membered not that Sniffy had been the
most errant lambkin of her difficult
flock.
George and the other youthful pall-
bearers sat in the tiny front room of
Sniffy’s home. The air was heavy with
the scent of jonquils and violets. A
strange nervousness seized George. He
looked along the row of boys all trying
to assume a fitting air of solemnity ; at
Fatty Taylor, who was succeeding best
of all.
George fumbled in his pocket. “Here,”
he whispered to Fatty, “feel this.”
The unsuspecting Fatty seized it and
immediately uttered a startled “Ow!”
George giggled. The trick had worked.
He and Sniffy had thought of it just a
few days ago. To stick a cork full of
pins, cover it with a handkerchief, and
get someone to grab it. And Fatty had
grabbed. George giggled delightedly
again.
The undertaker gave a scandalised
“Hush!” and looked at them with melan-
choly disapproval. In a low voice he
explained to them their duties.
George sat bolt unright in the front
seat of the car that followed Sniffy. He
did not look at the lines of staring chil-
dren, though he was fully conscious that
they all saw him.
«I OWER it carefully and slowly and
then step back,” the undertaker
said.
It was easy. Sniffy wasn’t heavy at
all. And what a snifter box it was
Faintly, as George’s eyes traced out a
lovely golden scroll, came the mumble
of the preacher’s words, “ashes to ashes.”
Thud.
Thud.
What was that? They were throwinc
dirt in on top of Sniffy.
Something in George’s throat swelled
and threatened to strangle him They
couldn’t do that to Sniffy. They couldn’t
leave him there. It was cold and wet

How a Cyclone Fence
will help you
“Cyclone” is not a
“type” of fence, but
is our registered
trade mark and can
only be legally ap-
plied to fencing
manufactured by us.
jl/l OST likely you do not realise how your
old post and wire fences are reducing
your profits. The need for constant repairs
costs you money for materials. What is
worse, it takes up valuable time that should
be spent in PROFITABLE work with your
stock and crops.
A “Cyclone” Fence ends all that because it
NEVER need's repairs. Its immovable Ring-
lock Joints stand every strain. Its HARD-
steel wire is indestructible. Those two
features—features which no other fence can
give you—make “Cyclone” practically
everlasting.
There is the correct type of “Cyclone” Ring-
lock for every class of fencing (sheep,
lambs, cattle, horses, pigs). For paddock
subdivision—whether temporary or per-
manent—“ Cyclone” Ring-lock fence stands
alone. Post the coupon for FREE catalogue

up a hammer. Perhaps if he banged

A Dramatic Sketch of Tautened Nerves: —
THE MAN WITH
THE AXE
BY HARRY PAOLL.
Was that a scream ? Yes, by God, it
was! From the house, too !
He trailed the axe, and looked. What
the devil was the matter? What could
be the matter ?
WHEN she heard the click
of the latch she dropped
“Primitive Passion” and
looked through the window.
The man who now closed the
gate behind him walked slowly
along the crescent path toward
the door. She sniffed her dis-
appointment. She’d hoped the caller
was somebody she knew. This man
was a canvasser, no doubt. He was
poorly clad. Not radio or insurance.
Those men were of neater appearance.
Should she answer the door?
She stood up, and when he knocked
she opened the door a few inches and
peered out. He was a youngish man,
strong-looking, and hadn’t shaved for a
couple of days. She waited for him to
speak. But he raised his old hat first —
very courteously, she decided. A natur-
ally-performed action, not a mere after-
thought.
“Good afternoon, missus,” he said.
“I’ve called to see if you have any little
odd job you can give me. A bit of
gardening, perhaps?” He pointed to the
flowerbeds.
She shook her head. Gardening was
George’s week-end pleasure. Mustn’t
touch the garden.
“No little job at all? I don’t want
much pay. I’m glad to get a bob, or
even sixpence.”
She was sympathetic, but what could
she do? Then she hesitated. There was
the wood —a ton of box blocks. Some-
body had to split them, and certainly
George didn’t like wood-chopping. He
got cross and swore savagely. She said,
slightly hesitant: “Would you split
wood?”
“Certainly! ”
“I’ll give you two shillings if you’ll
—well, there’s a ton in the backyard.
1 really don’t know how much you
should do.”
“I’ll give you your money’s worth,
missus. Where is an axe?”
“Go round the side,” she told him.
“You’ll see the wood and the axe there.”
“Thanks, missus.”
She closed the door and listened to
his plodding steps on the asphalted side-
path.
Presently she heard the crack of the
axe on wood.
SHE was about to take up her novel
when a sudden thought stirred.
Had she been unwise? She was alone.
She went to the rear of the house, to
the enclosed porch, and, parting the win-
dow curtains an inch or two, glanced
down the yard. He was swinging the axe
steadily.
There was an old easychair under the
window. She sat on the arm and medi-
tated. Then she went back to the front
door and opened it a little. This was
a relief. It brought the world nearer.
She returned to the arm of the chair
and took another look at the man. Still
working. What a pleasant time George
had when compared to hers. Day after
day she was left to fill in the hours as
best she could while he was in the city
meeting people and enjoying ever-varying
experiences. No, marriage wasn’t com-
plete happiness. Nothing was, of course.
Reading—one tired of that. Gossiping
to neighbors—she’d never deliberately
cultivate such a proletarian habit. Go
out for a stroll about the streets —that
grew wearisome. Same streets; same
shops. Sickening. Silly thing to do.
She frowned and compressed her lips
He couldn’t know she was alone in the
house. She needn’t worry. For all he
knew there were half a dozen burly men
with her. He wouldn’t risk anything un-
pleasant. Still, she had been foolish.
That was her impulsiveness again. Just
because he raised his hat nicely. Might
be simply one of those oily rogues far
worse than uncouth men. Only the other
day hadn’t a hawker ransacked a Brigh-
ton house? Pretended to hawk cheap
kerosene. A woman alone couldn’t do
much. She was of nervous temperament,
too. Even George admitted that. Highly
strung. One could scream, of course.
Well, here was a queer thing! By her
foolish action she had tied herself to
the house! She had imprisoned herself!
She could not go out while he was there.
Suppose she did go out. She’d feel
easier, but ten to one when she returned
he’d be gone with everything he could
carry away. Besides, there was his
wages.
Kidnapping! That was done only in
America. But local crimes! That case
of a murdered girl in pyjamas. Appar-
ently had had her head smashed while
she was sleeping. With an axe, too,
wasn’t it? What a gruesome thing if
a man smashed you with the very
weapon you’d given him! Dirty beasts,
men. Some men. What caused their
crime? Did it sweep over them sud-
denly? Or did they ponder over it —
brood, like perhaps this man was doing
even now; thinking, “Now I’ll just chop
for a while to allay suspicions, then I’ll
sneak up quickly, and before you can
say Jack Robinson”
SHE clutched the curtains. What a
stupid person she was! Perhaps
she read too many of those morbid
books. Or something anyhow. Just
because she was alone here and he didn’t
even know it. Besides, if she watched
from here he couldn’t very well steal in
unexpectedly. She’d be out the front
door like lightning. What things did
happen in life! No need to go to novels
for occurrences. Bodies burned piece
by piece in stoves ; bodies in culverts ;
bodies under houses. There must be
many, many murders never discovered.
Girl disappears. Perhaps just ran away ;
perhaps white slavery ; perhaps secretly f
murdered. Who could tell? But men
didn’t come into a house deliberately
to commit murder. Passion crimes, most,
murders were. What was that word?
Path-path-pathological —yes, sex path-
ology, that was it.
No, a man just thinks, “Here is a
chance ; I wonder can I rob this place;,
and get away with the proceeds?” He (
wouldn’t want to encounter opposition,
even from a defenceless woman. That
would be accidental. For instance, put
yourself in his place. Just drops the axe,
thinks “Here’s my chance; she might
be in a front room,” opens the porch
door and creeps in to steal.
Yes, and perhaps sex, after all. You
don’t know what fearful sleeping de-
pravity lies behind a man’s eyes. George
says that’s true. Read Forel, George
says. A German, wasn’t he? You rub
shoulders with them, George says, every
day. Lust is the most frightful thing...

The curtain grew taut, the rod slipped
from its socket and fell, and the curtain
slithered along her face. She uttered a
sharp, piercing scream.
THE man swung the axe vigorously.
* He wasn’t accustomed to axe-wok,
but splitting box was child’s play. After
a time his actions became automatic, and
he began to think evenly as he swung
his arms. He’d broke into a little luck
at last. How many refusals came before
this one opportunity? How many beastly
insults? You had to put up with some
rotten people. Surely to God a man was
entitled to ask for work! Well, two bob
was two bob. He’d give this young
woman a good money’s-worth. Might
as well split a few logs extra to make
certain. Nice young woman ; rather
skinny and pallid, but genuine. Damn
these blocks with knots in! The old
axe wouldn’t be much use for anything
but splitting wood. Fancy chopping
against the grain with it!
Two bob. That raised the problem
whether to spend the two bob some way
or do as Barney suggested. Barney was
a wonderful battler and knew what he
was talking about. Two bobs’ worth of
a good cheap soap. Then you cut it up
into small squares, wrapped them neatly
in colored paper and hawked them at,
say, sixpence a square. Say sixteen
squares. Sixteen sixpences. Eight shil-
lings. That was four hundred per cent,
profit, wasn’t it? Building up in that
way you might get a few bob together
in a few weeks. Enough to start hawk-
ing properly. Fish or fruit. On the
other hand-^—
Was that a scream? Yes, by God, it
was! From the house, too!
OE trailed the axe, and looked. What
11 the devil was the matter? What
could be the matter?
He saw her white face at the rear
window and her frightened eyes. Seemed
to be appealing to him. Horrified about
something. He took a few irresolute
steps forward, carrying the axe.
She screamed again, louder than be-
fore. Something was wrong. He broke
into a run, and a third scream made his
blood run cold. He dashed to the back
door. Perhaps it was only a fit, but, by
God, it might be something tragic! He
grasped the knob. Her voice within
shrieked:
“Murder! Help! Murder!”
He sprang inside.
D OLICE-CON ST A BLE HEGARTY,
* in civilian clothes, strode discon-
solately along the street. He was peeved,
and rightly so. He considered himself
to be the finest centre half-forward in
the force, and yet he’d been omitted
from the team selected to meet Railways.
That damned Hellings and his jealousy,
of course. Well, he’d play no more foot-
ball ; he’d resign from the club ; he’d
Hegarty stopped. Was that a woman’s
scream? Sounded like it. Came from
this house. Hubby belting her, probably.
Not a police business, and perhaps she
deserved it.
Another scream. Confound it! An-
other. Suddenly he poised himself as a
trained athlete will, tense and alert. He
had heard a word he couldn’t ignore.
“Murder! Help! Murder!”
He dashed through the gate. The front
door was open. He heard a confusion
of sounds, dominated by a series of
short, sharp screams. He rushed down a
passage, his eyes gleaming. He saw a
young woman crouching by a chair under
a window, her face livid with terror. A
shabbily-clad man with a gleaming axe
in one hand stood before her, reaching
out with his disengaged arm. •
With powerful jerk and expert thumb
pressure, he rendered the axe-arm power-
less. The axe dropped from the numbed
fingers. Then, with commendable celer-
ity, Hegarty slipped a perfect hammer
lock on the other arm.
The woman clung, half-swooning, to
Hegarty’s shoulder.
“Oh, thank God! Thank God!”
“I’m a policeman,” he said grimly.
“What’s all this about?”
“Oh, this awful man! He ran in and
attacked me. Oh, the fiend!”
She began to pour out a disjointed
story, and Hegarty soon gathered suffi-
cient for him to comprehend the whole
business.
“I see!” He put a vicious pressure on
the man’s arm. “By God!” said Hegarty,
“this means a long stretch for you, you
swine! ”

OPIUM AND CABBAGES.
BY FRANK WALFORD.

“A cliaffbag.”
‘‘Oh, a cliaffbag? And what's in the
chaff bag ?”
“Cabbages?'
“A nswer my question !”
AT this time in Queensland’s
yesterday a police cutter
stationed at Cairns was the
latest addition to the small craft
of the North. She had been designed by
the Department of Public Works, and
looked it.
“Built by a carpenter and rigged by
a, bishop, from the look of her,” criti-
cised Hoppy Lamond. “I’d love to see
her trying to push that bluff bow through
the water. Why, I’d swim faster than
she could sail.”
“I don’t know,” said Captain Tom
solemnly. “She might be a surprise
packet. The Lamia certainly would have
the heels of her, but you might have to
get something faster than that herring-
gutted schooner of yours to be safe.”
“Humph,” ejaculated Hoppy scorn-
fully, and poured himself another rum.
ANE morning in June, when the light
south-east winds blow by day and
a clock calm prevails by night, Hoppy
Lamond came sailing into the Johnstone
River to seek Captain Tom. He moored
his vessel beside a sandspit just inside
the bar, and was pulled upstream by two
of his Kanakas. He found the Lamia
anchored in the fresh water of the south
branch of the river, with her skipper loll-
ing on the hatch reading Keats.
“Chuck that novel overboard,” he
bawled, “and get a man a drink.”
Captain Tom laid down his book and
grinned. “Tough luck for you, Hoppy ;
but you know I don’t keep liquor on
board.”
Hoppy climbed over the combing and
fished a bottle of rum from under his
loose tunic. “I know that, Tom, so I
brought it with me. Get up a chunk of
ice and some slops for yourself and we’ll
talky-talk.”
“What’s the trouble, Hoppy?” asked
Captain Tom, sipping his limejuice.
“I want your advice, and perhaps your
help. It’s that dam’ police cutter. She’s
haunting me like a family ghost. Wher-
ever I go she bobs up a few hours later.
That’s not so bad, because I can lose
her whenever I please. She can’t sail,
her crew don’t know the reefs, and by
the same token they can’t handle her
either. The real trouble is that somehow
they’ve got wind about a cargo of opium
I’m to run into Cairns. That’s why she’s
dogging me round. I must lift it on
Tuesday week, and she’s bound to be
on the spot.”
Captain Tom scratched his nose
thoughtfully. “Where are you picking it
up?”
“It’s to be dropped from the Man-
churian and Malay Company’s boat,
tied to a buoy. They’ll heave it over
when I sail past them, and I’ll pick it
up a little later.”
“I can’t quite get what you’re scared
about. You’ve got the heels of that
police abortion.”
“I know that.”
“Well, as long as you get away with
it they can’t prove anything, and suspi-
cion never hurt anybody round these
parts yet.”
“It’s not that, Tom. They’ve got reli-
able information that I’m to land the
stuff. Even if I dodge the police cutter
I'm almost certain to be stopped by that
blasted gunboat, or searched when 1 sail
into Cairns.”
“Call it off altogether.”
“Then they lose the stuff. The
steamer’ll be searched at Townsville, and
the opium pinched by the Customs!”
Captain Tom laid a finger along his
nose. It looked a tough problem.
THE Manchurian and Malay Com-
-1 pany’s steamer Samarcand was

ville when she sighted three small sailing
vessels at seven o’clock one morning.
One was a white fore-and-aft schooner
which sailed past within half a mile with
her sheets eased. Three miles astern of
the schooner lumbered a grey cutter with
two waves rolling outward from her bluff
bows. A couple of miles to wind’ard of
both, a graceful black yawl slipped
quietly through the placid water with a
huge gaff-topsail aloft.
Suddenly the schooner rounded into
the wind, came about and headed south-
west with the wind abeam. Directly
astern of the steamer she was shaken into
stays, where she hung for some minutes
with her canvas flapping. Then her head
paid away and she romped north before
the wind, followed by the cutter. The
yawl continued on her way.
ON board the schooner Hoppy was
busily engaged attaching three
buckets by their handles to a light coir
kellick-line. When they were fastened
to his satisfaction he dropped them over
the port combing, where they were hidden
from view of the pursuing cutter. The
effect on the schooner’s progress became
marked as he slowly paid out the line ;
and the pursuer began to overhaul her.
Down the wind came, an exultant shout
as this fact became manifest to the cut-
ter’s crew, and they clumsily set a small
topsail.
Five hours later the cutter was foam-
ing along half a mile in the schooner’s
wake and steadily creeping nearer.
Within seven hours she had reduced the
gap to a bare quarter-mile, and a hail
rang out.
“Heave to!” came the order.
“Get those buckets up,” snapped
Hoppy to a Kanaka. “What’s up?” he
yelled to his pursuer, while two boys
hauled the trailing utensils on board.
“Heave to!”
“What for?”
“I want to come aboard.”
“Righto! Wait till I get some of this
canvas off her.”
The little schooner rounded into the
wind and hung in stays while the
Kanakas dropped her sails. She was
under bare poles by the time the cutter
had come alongside, dropped a couple
of fenders and made fast.
“What’s the meaning of this?” fumed
Hoppy as a sergeant of police and two
constables climbed on board.
“We’re going to search your boat,”
said the sergeant shortly.
“Search my boat!” protested Hoppy.
“What do you want to search my boat
for?”
“That’s my business,” retorted the ser-
geant, and went below, followed by the
constables.
A YELL from one of the cutter’s crew
brought them on deck again.
“They dropped a bag over the side,
sir,” said the man, “right up in the
bows.”
The sergeant ran for’ard and peered
into the clear water, but could discover
no trace of the jettisoned bag.
“If it’s still afloat we’ll have drifted
past it by this,” explained the cutter’s
skipper. “The wind is setting the boats
north. Most likely it’s well astern now.”
“There’s a float over there, sir,” called
the other member of the crew, pointing
astern, where a small spar was visible
fifty yards distant.
“Put the dinghy over,” ordered the
cutter’s skipper, “and see what it is.”
The two men launched the boat and
paddled across to the bobbing float.
They tied it to a ringbolt in the stern-
post and paddled slowly back.
“What’s tied to that piece of wood?”
inquired the sergeant as the dinghy drew
alongside.
“A chaff bag,” replied Hoppy sulkily.
“Oh, a chaffbag? And what’s in the
chaffbag?”
“Cabbages.”
“Answer my question!” thundered the
sergeant. “What’s in that bag ?
“I told you,” replied Hoppy. “It’s
only cabbages.”
“You won’t gain anything by playing
the fool,” said the sergeant. “Get that
bag up on deck here,” he called to the
crew of the dinghy. “We’ll soon see
what’s in it, though it’s not hard to
guess.”
A CONSTABLE dropped a rope’s-end,
and one of the men passed a couple
of half-hitches round a line which
stretched downward from the spar.
The line, hauled on board, was fol-
lowed by fifteen feet of Europe, with a
bulging chaffbag lashed to a bowline at
its end.
“Now we’ll take a peep at your cab-
bages,” commented the sergeant with
elaborate sarcasm, and slit the bag from
end to end with his pocket-knife. Out
rolled two dozen cabbages, accompanied
by a piece of old chain which evidently
had been included as a sinker.
The sergeant gasped. “What’s the
meaning of this tomfoolery?” he de-
manded.
Hoppy gazed at him glumly, and
picked up one of the cabbages.
“You’ve bruised it,” he complained.
“I told you they were cabbages. Why
did you handle them so roughly? We
won’t have any decent vegetables for
tea now.”
“The stuff may be inside the cab-
bages,” suggested one of the constables.
“We’ll soon see,” said the sergeant.
“Rip ’em all open down the centre.”
“Don’t you hack my cabbages about,”
exclaimed Hoppy in alarm. “They cost
me sixpence each in Cairns. There’s
twelve shillings’ worth there. Someone
will have to pay for them if they’re dam-
aged any more.”
“Cut them open,” said the sergeant
brusquely, and the two constables care-
fully sliced each vegetable in halves.
“Why did you throw them in the
water?” inquired the sergeant after a
pause.
“To freshen them up.”
“Why didn’t you tie the line to the
rail?”
“I never thought of it,” replied Hoppy,
slapping his thigh in disgust. “Crumbs,
it’s a great idea, though. I’ll make a
note of it for the future. Have you any
suggestions about cooking them?”
The sergeant snorted and turned away.
“Search this boat from end to ned,” he
ordered. “We saw him stop and pick
up some stuff from that steamer. It’s
aboard somewhere.”
It was then nearly 4 p.m.; and until
the fading light heralded the advent of
night the search continued. Reluctantly
the sergeant decided that nothing con-
traband was on aboard, and gave orders
to his men to return to the cutter.
“What about those cabbages?” asked
Hoppy.
“What about them?”
“Who’s going to pay for them? You
can’t board an innocent trading craft and
destroy its stores. What am I to give my
men for their tea? Two of them are on
diet and must have fresh green vege-
tables. You can’t destroy twelve bobs’
worth of cabbages like that and get away
with it. Who’s paying for the damage?”
“Send your account in to the Gov-
ernment,” snarled the sergeant as the
cutter’s head fell away.
HOPPY made sail without replying.
When the two boats were about a
hundred fathoms apart, he hailed the
cutter.
“Luff her a minute,” he shouted. “I
want to speak to you. It’s important.”
Obediently the cutter’s head came up-
wind and the schooner ran down to her.
“What’s the matter?” asked the ser-
geant.
“Come aboard,” said Hoppy. “111
own up.”
After ten minutes’ manoeuvring the
cutter once more lay alongside the
schooner, and the sergeant and his men
clambered on board.
“Well,” he said gruffly, “where’s the
stuff?”
“What stuff?”
“The opium,” replied the sergeant
testily. “What stuff did you think 1
meant?”
“I don’t know. I didn’t think about
it at all.”
“You said you were going to own
up.”
“So I am.”
“Get it off your chest then.”
Hoppy stared gloomily at the deck.
“I told you a deliberate lie, sergeant,”
he confessed.
“1 know that. What’s the truth of it?”
“I said that two of my men were on
diet.”
The sergeant started savagely. •
“It’s not true, sergeant. I was only
trying to bolster up my claim for the
damage to my cabbages. I’ll call my
crew aft, and you can see for yourself
they’re quite healthy. 1 lied to you.”
The sergeant glared at him with crim-
son cheeks.
“Did you bring us back here to tell
me that?” he inquired ominously.
Hoppy lifted innocent eyes. “Yes, ser-
geant. I couldn’t have slept a wink to-
night with that wilful lie on my con-
science. I simply had to confess.”
The sergeant appeared in imminent
danger of apoplexy.
“And, sergeant, I also lied about the
price of the cabbages. They were marked
sixpence each, but I got the two dozen
for eleven shillings. I can’t rob the
Government; eleven shillings will square
the damage.” j•,
Twice the sergeant attempted to say
something, but the sentences refused to
leave his lips; he was incapable of
speech. He stared angrily at Hoppy, who
met his gaze with the bland eyes of a
child. Then the sergeant turned to his
constables. They were gazing straight
ahead of them with impassive features.
“Get on board again,” he snarled with
an effort. “I won’t forget this, Lamond,”
he added, as he turned to follow.
“I hope not,” replied Hoppy suavely.
“Eleven shillings will be the claim. I
trust you won’t forget.”
Twenty miles south of Cairns Hoppy
was stopped by H.M. gunboat Kestrel
and searched again. He bore the indig-
nity patiently, but complained bitterly to
the lieutenant in charge of the boarding
party about the manner in which the
police had damaged his cabbages. “They
deliberately cut them all in halves,” he
said indignantly.
NEXT evening the gunboat’s com-
mander boarded the police cutter at
Cairns and listened to the story of the
search for the opium.
“He had the opium on board all right, ’
said the sergeant positively. “We saw
him pick it up.”
The commander shook his head
thoughtfully. “He did not have the
opium,” he rejoined quietly.
“Didn’t have it!” ejaculated the ser-
geant. “Why we watched him round
to and grapple it.”
The commander shrugged. “That was
just a little pantomime,” he declared.
“Ask yourselves why he allowed you
to overhaul him.”
“He didn’t. We outsailed him. Our
craft simply flew along when we set her
topsail.”
“You’ve certainly got a fine little
hooker here,” said the commander men-
daciously, “but she can’t outsail
Lamond’s schooner. The only boat in
these waters which has the heels of her
is that black yawl belonging to Harka-
way.”
“His yawl’s certainly a clinker,” ad-
mitted the sergeant. “I was watching her
as she sailed past while we were after
Lamond.”
The commander stiffened in his chair.
“Do you tell me that Harkaway
near while all this was happening?” he
asked.
“Not exactly. He was about two miles
to win’ard of us when the Samarcand
passed.”
The commander forgot his dignity and
whistled. “That’s your man,” he said.
“This business with Lamond was merely
byplay to keep you busy while Harka-
way picked up the opium and got clear.
Hoppy deliberately led you a dance, tow-
ing an anchor or something overboard
to let you catch him. The bag of cab-
bages was designed either to waste more
time or to fool you wantonly, I can’t say
which. Anyway, you can accept my word
for it that Harkaway got the opium;
by this time it’s safe in some Chinese
shack or other.”
The sergeant had the last word. “I
don’t think he was towing anything,” he
said stubbornly. “We sailed him down.
This little craft’s a deal faster than you
think. She simply flew with that topsail
up.”
«T OM ” said Hoppy, after he had en-
-1 tertained his friend with a detailed
account of the adventure, “there’s no
doubt you’re a genius. There’s only one
thing that’s worrying me.”
“What’s that?” inquired Captain Tom
Harkaway lazily.
“I lied to the sergeant on the second
occasion. The cabbages didn’t cost me
eleven shillings ; they were stale ones,
and I got the lot for five bob. Do you
think I should tell him?”


THE BERNARD
CRONIN STORY-
WRITING COURSE
10 LESSONS.
Mr. Cronin's course is a masterpiece of
expert practicality. The components of
a story-—theme, plot, openings, dialogue,
characterisation and description the
very names of which excite the imagina-
tion, and the awe, of literary aspirants,
are considered in detail with a wealth of
illustration and practical advice that at
once removes many of the more serious
obstacles from the path of the beginner.
The instruction is given in ten lessons
and three supplements. Mr. Cronin’s
own enthusiasm is so great, his sympathy
so large and his handling of the practice
work sent in so competently confident
that the interest of his pupils never flags.
Those who have a real flair for writing
very soon make a good job of every
piece of work they send in. They are
helped the more inasmuch as they are
never kept waiting for their revised work.
It is true that pupils have to work.
Mr. Cronin is not content with less than
the best they can do ; and neither are
they allowecj to rest content until he has,
by instruction and illustrative revision
of parts, trained them to polish and re-
polish until the whole is a finished piece
of work truly expressive of the writer’s
intention and individuality.
Later, in the advanced lessons, the
pupil is sometimes asked to return to an
earlier story, and in the light of his —
and frequently her—added experience
and increased knowledge improve it to
publication standard. Mr. Cronin is
most insistent, however, on his pupils
submitting to editors' none but good
work. Not, of course, the best they ulti-
mately will do, but work of such a stan-
dard as will preclude the possibility of
their being classed by editors as per-
manent mediocrities.
The results are becoming increasingly
apparent. Some are given in detail in
“Friendships,” copies of which can be
had on request.
Jn addition to teaching story-writing,
Mr. Cronin criticises the MSS. of writers
who have had only a limited success.
This critical service has proved of great
value to many whose work, through
minor faults of construction or presenta-
tion, has just failed to get publication.
Mr. Cronin’s Story-writing Course is
fully described in an illustrated pamph-
let, “Writing to Win.” Copies will be
sent post free to any reader of The
Bulletin who would like one.
Newspaper Articles and Paragraphs.
Those specially interested in the criti-
cism of MSS. or in the writing of news-
paper articles and paragraphs are
requested to mention the fact.

nard Cronin, c/o E. H. Welford, 398

to a Man s Career
DR. NORWOOD says that “ A Proper Grasp of
Pelmanism Would save any life from Futility
Amongst,the many Australians who have achieved distinction in Great
Britain, none is regarded more highly, either there or in Australia, than Dr.
Norwood. Dr. Norwood is the Minister of the City Temple, London. He
has travelled much, has had a wide experience of men and of life, is a keen
observer and a great thinker.
lJr. J . W. Morwoodj I».U.
Of the City Temple,
London.
“Pelmanism,” Dr. Norwood says, “is
sound Psychology and an admirable
system of Mind-training. It is more
than mere Memory training. There is
no co-ordination of knowledge without
a retentive memory, but the mind is
more than memory. It involves the
whole man.
“Pelmanism reduces to a coherent
system what every person who lives
intelligently and strongly must at least
partly carve out for himself. A proper
grasp of it would save any life from
futility and would cause many to dis-
cover powers latent within themselves
of the existence of which they had not
dreamed. It teaches that man has the
key to his own career and enables
many to find the key itself which, for
want of self-knowledge, had lain un-
discovered.’'
Amongst other well-known Pelmanists
are:
msst
iOru KirUiell.
Rord Riddell.
Sir Arthur Quiller-
Couch.
Dame Sybil
Thorndike.
Rady Keehle.
Rord Baden-
Powell.
Sir Herbert
Barker.
Sir Herbert
Austin.
And many others.
Pelmanism does, indeed, bring out
the mind’s latent powers and develops
them to the highest point of efficiency.
It strengthens Will-Power; it develops
Personality; it gives Courage, Initiative,
Forcefulness and Determination. It
banishes the defects which interfere
with the efficient working of the mind,
and in their place it develops such
attributes and qualities as:
concentration
*3
ow
Initiative
Self-confidence
Presence of Mind
Organising Power
Courage
Cheerfulness
and a Reliable Memory.
The development of these strong,
positive, vital qualities contributes to
one’s earning capacity and makes it
possible to live intelligently in the
present and build strongly for the
future. What is of equal importance
is that there is increased happiness
and a keener appreciation of the
beauties of Nature, the Arts and Life
generally.
In a sentence, Pelmanist's live a
fuller, happier and more successful
existence.
This is borne out by the letters re-
ceived from those who have taken the
Course, some extracts from which are
given here:
AN ACCOUNTANT states that Pelmanism
lias shown • him “how to overcome that
paralysing feeling of inferiority;”
A STUDENT writes: “I.have now an aim
in life. I have become more Observant. My
Concentration is more developed. My
Imagination lias increased.’ -
A SHOP ASSISTANT reports that he has
secured a better position, and attributes
this to Pelmanism.
A FARMWORKER writes: “Thanks to
Pelmanism, I am feeling more confident
and more alive.”
A MANAGER reports an increase in self-
confidence, “which has brought me the
respect of my colleagues.”
AN ENGINEER writes: “I feel especially
an increase in Self-confidence, which gives
professional status.”
A TYPIST says that she has abolished
groundless fears, and now leads a much
happier life.
A CLERK writes that he has improved
in memory, concentration and will-power,
and that his mind is quicker and more
alert.
A DOCTOR writes that he has improved
his powers of Observation. Concentration
and Memory, and has increased his Self-
confidence.
AN INSURANCE CLERK writes:
“Financially I am over 'M per cent, better
off than before: mentally and physically I
am hundreds per cent, better off.”
A WOMAN CLERK writes: “I can con-
centrate for quite a long period without my
mind wandering. 1 observe things far more
quickly, and have ever so much more con-
fidence in myself and my abilities. My
thoughts are far more orderly.”
A TEACHER wxdtes: “This Course ba-s
had a remarkable effect on my physical
and mental health. What pleases me most
is the certainty that I have lost, my fear.
My self-confidence has returned and my
whole outlook on life seems to he recon-
structed.”
A CARPENTER says Pelmanism has
helped him both physically and mentally.
Peltnanism is scientific development of
Mind, Memory and Personality.
The 'Pelman Institute is a world-wide organisation
of 30 years standing. Its headquarters are in London.
There are 650,000 World Pelmanists; 31,000 are in Australia and New Zealand.
A CLEROVMAN writes: “I have experi-
enced much benefit, and wish I had under-
taken the Course earlier in life. -Had I
known at the. age of 30 certain things
which I know now—largely through the
Pelman lessons —I think I could have
avoided one or two painful, nervous break-
downs . . . To summarise (and employ a
fashionable word). I think 1 have gained a
better orientation towards life.”
A BANK CLERK writes: “This Course
has enabled me to see clearly what I want
in life and how to got it. It has taken me
out of the rut. It. has shown me that,
whatever the circumstances may be. life
holds infinite possibilities of enjoyment and
improvement.”
Thousands of similar letters could be
printed did space permit.

SHEEPSKINS FOR BOOKBINDING
Instead of casing its books in orthodox cloth binding, The Endeavour
Press has tested the possibility of using tanned Australian sheepskins
for the purpose. The result is a remarkable credit to local crafts-
manship. A special autographed and numbered edition of Brian
Penton’s “Landtakers” has been produced in this richly unique bind-
ing. Specimen books can be viewed in Sydney at Dymock’s, David
Jones’s book counter, Moore’s Book Shop and Preece’s Book Shop.
As the edition is confined to 23 copies only, all first impressions, it
will doubtless be a source of interest to collectors of limited and
special editions. The price is two guineas each, and Bulletin readers
who would like to procure one of these valuable books should write
to any of the above retail shops or direct to
The Endeavour Press, 252 George Street,
Sydney.

The Tasma “190”
This receiver is a 5-valve
battery - operated super-
heterodyne designed for
the “Out Back’’ listener.
The receiver is one of the
most popular in the Tasma
range, and is noted for its
splendid tone and EX-
TREME economy in bat-
teries.
The Tasma ‘180”
Everyone can now afford
a Tasma ! The “180’’ sells
at an extremely low price,
yet employs 5 valves in a
superheterodyne circuit,
uses full-size parts, is
housed in a large crafts-
man-built cabinet and in
every way is a typical
Tasma product.
«lj|E’S the radio repair man. When the set starts making weird noises or
li doesn’t want to play, you ring him up, and he comes along to fix
things. Awfully nice man, too. Used to be in and out of here a lot before
we bought the Tasma. ...
“In a way, I miss that man. Told me such a lot about radio . . . said more
than once that if everybody built sets like Tasma he’d be out of a job. My
husband heard that—and he bought a Tasma.
“No need for the repair man now, poor chap. Nothing ever goes wrong.
You simply can’t work it to death. It just goes on behaving perfectly all
the time. No matter what station you want you simply turn the dial—and
there it is . . . right on the dot! And so clear! . . . Marvellous radio!”
Mrs. Brown’s set is a Tasma “135”—a 5-valve superhet that brings in every
Australian station she wants. Apart from the tone, the cabinet is the thing
that she is most proud of. Ask your nearest radio dealer to let you see and
hear a Tasma “135” and you will share her enthusiasm.
Full information on any Tasma receiver can be obtained from any
leading dealer, or direct from the manufacturers, THOM & SMITH,
LTD., 55 Dowling Street, East Sydney.
TheTasma “Voyager”
A remarkably efficient 7-
valve all-wave superhetero-
dyne. This set, as well as
being capable of picking up
at full volume practically
every Australian and New
Zealand station, will re-
ceive the world’s short-wave
broadcasters.
m
The Tasma “195”
Here is a receiver that
works with equal effici-
ency from either A.C. or
D.C. current
Its range, its selectivity, its
ease of tuning and its ex-
treme NATURALNESS of
tone are things that need
demonstrating to be
appreciated.
