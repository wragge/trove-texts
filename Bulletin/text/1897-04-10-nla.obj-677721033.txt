Olive Schreiner’s New Book.
‘ Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland is a
Tract—a South African Tract. A Tract is a
thing which, like the moon, shows you only one
side : which places natural law on a Procrustean
bed of artificial theories—lopping it here, stretch-
ing it there, suppressing, and adding, and em-
bellishing until the Thing That Is is made to look
like the Thing That Never Was, and earth and
sea, sun and stars, gods and men, the whole con-
ceivable universe, are demeaned and distorted in
the reductio ad' dbsurdurn of one puny intelli-
gence. Taking him by and large, Man is a slow
old clock, whose morality-hands move very tardily
indeed round the vast dial of Time. So the Tract
just anticipates a little, and when it is ten o’clock
in the morality morning it shoves the hands round
to half-past four o’clock in the afternoon—or what
it imagines is half-past four o’clock in the after-
noon—which doesn’t help things any, and is apt
to spoil the temper of the clock. In a dozen
words, the Tract is admeasurement of the infi-
nitely great by the standard of the infinitely little.
In one word, the Tract is a Lie.
* » * *
Follows that, considered as Literature or Art,
Olive Sehreiner’s tract is a failure. It fails
because, however true in fact or intention, it is
false' in method and results. And the author’s
dominant sex, which has been balancing for the
last fifteen years, now asserts itself as female. Her
literary vitality is waning, her literary hysteria in-
creasing. The intellectual plane of her new book is
but little above that of ‘ Marie Corelli ’ —to whose
envenomed jealousy Olive Schreiner has hitherto
risen easily superior. But one machine-god is no
better than another, and all are fatal to truth—
that is, to Art. Olive Schreiner uses a god to
attack men and ideas she does not like, and puts
Words into his mouth to suit herself. ‘Marie
Corelli ’ uses a devil to attack men and ideas she
does not like, and puts words into his mouth to
suit herself. The method is the same ; only Olive
Schreiner’s ideas are better, and, under the cir-
cumstances, there is more sense in denouncing
Cecil Rhodes than in denouncing black-hearted
critics. But with just as much reason and just as
much artistic effect gods and devils could be used
to attack Olive Schreiner and ‘ Marie Corelli.'
* * * *
: tAs an ad captandum argument, as a shriek to
the Nonconformist Conscience of Great Britain,
Olive Schreiner’s tract may have a striking suc-
cess. One ponders with interest how the Rhodes-
cajoled Stead will like being hoist with his own
petard, and proved by Scripture (not to mention
facts) to be the accomplice of robbers and mur-
derers. For ‘ Peter Halket ’ is a very skilful
appeal to the low religious order of mind which
swamps the British community. And it has right
on its side, and justice, and much actual truth—
and a god of the most approved pattern to ex-
pound them in simple language which can hardly
fail to drive conviction home. Really, the Non-
conformist Conscience ought to squirm to some
purpose. But such an appeal was unworthy of
the Olive Schreiner who wrote ‘ The Story of an
African Farm.’
4
When the story opens Peter is sitting all alone
beside his fire, and not feeling very well. Facb is,
Peter is lost, and has had no tucker since morn-
ing. He has a flask of brandy, but it is only a
small flask, and bad brandj r . And the longer he
sits the less well Peter feels.
* » » »
Peter is a young man—under 21; with pale
blue eyes, slanting forehead, a weedy carcase, and
no intellectuals worth mentioning—a good poten-
tial Salvation Army captain, in fact. His busi-
ness is to hunt niggers in Mashonaland, and his
employers are the Chartered Company, alias
Rhodes and Co. The niggers have been
hunted for a considerable area around lonely
Peter, and just at present he is engaged with a
dcWen others carrying provisions to one of the
troopers’ camps on ahead. The Mashonas’ kraals
have been burnt, the male occupants more or less
slaughtered, female ditto ‘dealt with,’ and there
is not much fear of attack. Nevertheless Peter
was sent out this morning to act as scout —and
Peter got lost, as weedy young fellows with slant-
ing foreheads occasionally will. But he knows
his mates will come and look for him in the
morning, so he has made a fire, and sits over it in
a sad, hollow fashion, thinking of home- and
mother, and taking a nip of brandy at intervals.
* * * *
Now, what follows seems meant as the natural
sort of bad dream resulting from inferior brandy
on an empty stomach. Peter is a visionary kind
of cuss, and between the brandy and the empty
stomach and the thoughts of home and mother
and the weak intellectuals he evolves a beautiful
trance, and his mates have a job to wake
him when they find him in the morning.
And here is where the author’s art fails : for the
incidents of the trance are represented with all
the detail and definition of reality—not only to
Peter, but to the reader ; and, moreover, incidents,
thoughts and language are often beyond the range
of Peter’s knowledge, and such, therefore, as he
could not possibly have dreamt, no matter how
bad the brandy. For dreams cannot transcend
the dreamer: the unconscious brain cannot
originate ideas of which it has not previously
acquired the material. Thus, many 12th century
Europeans dreamt about the Crusades, but none
ever dreamt about kangaroos. And even the

hypnotist must build on a basis of previous know-
ledge. He can say to his subject: ‘ At ten o'clock
to-morrow morning you will write a letter to
So-and-so, asking him to call here ’ —and a good
subject will do it. But not if se has never learnt
to write.
* • * m
Peter Halket—his second name is Simon —is
apparently modelled on the lines of the old
original Simon Peter who Jives in the Acts of
the Apostles. This Peter also ‘ fell into a
trance ’ on an empty stomach. . He used to board
at a place in Joppa, and one day when
his soul abhorred hash rather more than
usual he got up from the table and went on
top of the house and fell asleep in disgust—while
the landlady remarked to the servant-girl on * the
airs these fifteen-drachma boarders do give them-
selves—and him with only one decent gaberdine
to his name, and if he doesn’t pay this week I’ll
pack him off as sure as my name’s Mary
Moses.’ But Peter on the housetop was having
a delicious dream. He thought he saw a big sheet
coming down from the sky, full of all kinds of
toothsome beasts and birds just jumping to be
cut up and thrust on a gridiron. And Peter
thought he heard a voice telling him to get up
slick and have quail on toast; and Peter didn’t,
so the big sheet was hauled up again. But pre-
sently down it came anew, just as full and just as
tempting, and the voice recommended Peter to
awake and arise and try some haunch of venison
and black currant jelly—and Peter wouldn’t. So
the sheet was hauled up a second time. But Peter
dreamt he looked so hungry and miserable that
down the sheet catne once more, and the voice
urged Peter to be a man and give his un-
biassed opinion about the lobster curry, any-
way— and Peter wasn’t game. So it was
‘Going, going, gone,’ and ‘the third time i.s
final,’ and Peter was given best as a bad
job, and the sheet was drawn up and stayed
up. And then plates rattled in the kitchen down
below, and Peter woke with his mouth water-
ing and his nose smelling the last odors of the
hash wafted from the washing-up.
* * * *
That is the old .original Simon Peter’s story of
his vision, and there is truth in every line of it.
The first thing a hungry man dreams of is a good
dinner; and the sheet, and the venison, and the
lobster—these were all within Peter’s previous
knowledge. But the new and spurious Simon
Peter [Olive Schreiner’s Peter Simon, with the
name just a little altered so as to avoid an action
for colorable imitation of trade-marks] doesn’t
think, in his trance, of the things he would like
to eat, or the things he knows all about. He
thinks of but we shall see as we go along.
* * * *
Mind, there is no direct statement that it is a
trance. The reality of the hollow Peter slides
imperceptibly into the dream.
From the darkness at the edge of the koppje a figure
stepped out into the full blaze of the fire-light.
Trooper Peter Halket looked up at it.
It was the tall figure of a man, olad in one loose linen
garment, reaching lower than his knees, and which clung
close about him. His head, arms, and feet were bare.
He carried no weapon of any kind ; and on his shoulders
hung heavy locks of dark hair.
Peter Halket looked up at him with astonishment.
“ Are you alone? ” he asked.
“ Yes, I am alone.”
Peter Halket lowered his gun and knelt up.
“Lost your way, I suppose?” be said, still holding his
weapon loosely.
“ No; I have come to ask whether I may sit beside
your fire for a while.”
“Certainly, certainly!” said Peter, eyeing the
stranger’s dress carefully, still holding his gun, but with
the hand off the lock. “I’m confoundedly glad of any
company. It’s a beastly night for anybody to be out
alone. Wonder you find your way. Sit down! sit
down 1 ” Peter looked intently at the stranger ; then he
put his gun down at his side.
The stranger sat down on the opposite side of the fire.
His complexion was dark ; his arms and feet were
bronzed; but his aquiline features and the domed fore-
head were not of any South African race.
* * * *
The hospitable Peter asks the stranger to have
a drink—
He took the small flask from his pocket and held it out.
“ I’m sorry there’s so little, but a drop will keep the cold
out.”
The stranger bowed his head ; but thanked and declined.
(Seems ‘ Cape smoke ’ isn’t ‘ class enough ’ for
celestial palates.)
Peter raised the flask to his lips and took a small
draught; then returned it to his pocket. The stranger
folded bis arms about his knees, and looked into the fire.
“ Are you a Jew ? ” asked Peter, suddenly ; as the fire
fell full on the stranger's face.
“ Yes ; I am a Jew.”
“Ah,” said Peter, “ that’s why I wasn’t able to make
out at first what nation you could be of ; your dress, you
know ” Then he stopped and said, “ Trading here, I
suppose ? Which country do you come from ; are you a
Spanish Jew ? ”
“ I am a Jew of Palestine.”
“Ah!” said Peter; “ I haven’t seen many from that
part yet. I came out with a lot on board ship ; and I’ve
seen Barnato and Beit; but they’re not very much like
you. I suppose it’s coming from Palestine makes the
difference.”
» * * •
Then the hospitable Peter regrets the absence
of tucker—
“ I’m sorry I haven’t anything to eat to offer you ; but
I haven’t had anything myself since last night. It’s
beastly sickening, being out like this with nothing to eat.
Wouldn’t have thought a fellow’d feel so bad after only
a day of it. Have you ever been out without grubf”
said Peter cheerfully, warming his hands at the blaze.
“Forty days and nights,” said the stranger.
“ Forty days 1 Phe—e—w ? ” said Peter. “ You must
have had a lot to drink, or you wouldn’t have stood it.”
* » * *
Then the hospitable Peter makes conversation—
about women, of course —and recounts some
African experiences in the wake of the Chartered
Co.
“ It wasn’t such a bad life, though. I only wish I was
back there again. I had two huts to myself, and a couple
of nigger girls. It’s better fun,” said Peter, after a
while, “ having these black women than whites. The
whites you’ve got to support, but the niggers support
you! And when you’ve done with them you can just
get rid of them. I’m all for the nigger gals.” Peter
laughed. But the stranger sat motionless with his arms
about his knees.
“You got any girls?” said Peter. “ Care for niggers ? ”
.“I love all women,” said the stranger, refolding his
arms about his knees.
“Oh, you do, do you?” said Peter. “Well, I’m pretty
sick of them. I had bother enough with mine,” he said
genially, warming his hands by the fire, and then inter-
locking the fingers and turning the palms towards the
blaze as one who prepares to enjoy a good talk. “One
girl was only fifteen ; I got her cheap from a policeman
who was living with her, and she wasn’t much. But the
other, by Gad ! I never saw another nigger like her;
well set up, I tell you, and as straight as that— " said
Peter, holding up his finger in the firelight. “She was
thirty if she was a day. Fellows don’t generally fancy
women that age ; they like slips of girls. But I set my
heart on her the day I saw her.”
* • * *
And Peter relates how one day he came home
and found his best girl talking to a nigger; and
how a little time afterwards, when there was more
‘ war ’ in Matabeleland, both girls basely deserted
him, taking all his ammunition and his old rifle;
“ And do you know,” said Peter, striking his knee, and
looking impressively across the fire at the stranger ;
“ what I’m sure of as that I’m sitting here? It’s that
that nigger I, caught at my hut, that day, was her nigger
husband! He’d come to fetch her that time ; and when
she saw she oouldn’t get away without me catching her, she
got the cartridges for him ! " Peter paused impressively
between the words. “ And now she’s gone back to him.
It's for him she’s taken that ammunition! ”
Peter looked across the fire at the stranger, to see what
impression his story was making.
“ I tell you what,” said Peter, “if I'd had any idea
who that bloody nigger was, the day I saw him standing
at my door, I’d have given him one cartridge in the back
of his head more than ever he reckoned for 1” . . ..
“You’ve been in the wars, too, I see,” said Peter
bending forward a little, and looking at the stranger’s
feet. “ By God ! Both of them!—And right through!
You must had a bad time of it?”
“ It was very long ago,” said the stranger.
* * * *
[Olive Schreiner used to have a savage wit—a
sort of saturnine appreciation of the incongruous
—but little humor at any time. Now, her sense
of humor seems gone altogether. At several
points already in this narrative the contrast
between Peter and the stranger has been pushed
over the edge of climax into an anti-climax of
smiles ; and now ! ‘ It was very long ago,’
said the stranger. . . . ‘ It’s not the first time
he’s done that r Pat,’ said a joking friend when
Q. Warden Mowbray kissed a back-blocks
bride. ‘Ah, begorrah, thin,’ said bridegroom
Pat with a heave of his shoulders, ‘ an’ divil a bit
oi care—if he hasn’t done it racently.’ . . . Or—
‘Pray, young woman, what is your name?’
‘Sarah, if you please, ma’am.’ ‘How long have
you been married?’ ‘ Married, ma’am ? ’ ‘Yes,
married.’ ‘lf you please, ma’am, I had a mis-
fortune, ma’am,” replied the girl, casting down
her eyes. ‘ What, have you not been married ? ’
‘No, ma’am, not yet.’ ‘Good heavens! Dr.
Middleton, what can you mean by bringing this
person here ? ’ exclaimed Mrs. Easy. ‘ Not a
married woman, and she has a child ! ’ ‘lf you
please, ma’am,’ interrupted the young woman,
dropping a courtesy, ‘ it was a very little one.’—
Mr. Midshipman Easy.~\
• * * *
They sat quiet in the blaze for a while.
Then Peter said, “ Did you see any niggers about yes-
terday? I haven’t come across any in this part.”
“There is,” said the stranger, raising himself, “an old
woman in a cave over yonder, and there is one man in the
bush, ten miles from this spot. He has lived there six
weeks, since you destroyed the kraal, living on roots and
herbs. He was wounded in the thigh, and left for dead.
He is waiting till you have all left this part of the country
that he may set out to follow his own people. His leg is
not yet so strong that he may walk fast.”
“ Did you speak to him ? ” said Peter.
“ I took him down to the water where a large pool was.
The bank was too high for the man to descend alone."
“ It’s a lucky thing for you our fellows didn’t catch
you,” said Peter. “Our captain’s a regular little mar-
tinet. He’d shoot you as soon as look at you, if he saw
you fooling round with a wounded nigger. It’s lucky you
kept out of his way.”
“The young ravens have meat given to them,” said
the stranger, lifting himself up ; “and the lions go down
to the streams to drink.”
Ah—yes said Peter ; “ but that’s because weean’t
help it! ”
* • • *
Then the stranger takes up the tongumg and
enquires who gave Peter the piece of land which
is his reward for trooper-service. ‘ Why, the
Chartered Company,’ says Peter. ‘And’who
pave it to the Chartered Company?’ ‘Why
England, of course.’ ‘And who gave it to
land ? ’ ‘ Oh, the English said it was theirs and
of course it was.’ And Peter affirms that the
niggers went with the land, and that they are
rebels, and the stranger wants to knows whether
Armenians are rebels, and Peter says ‘no, they
are on our side,’ and ‘you see, if we don’t help
the Armenians the Russians would ; and we’ve
got to prevent that: they’d get the land ; and it’s
on the road to India.’ And the stranger, having
stressed the contrast between Britain weeping
over the murdered and outraged Armenians, and
Britain murdering and outraging the Mashonas
and Matabeles, leaves the moral lying nice and
loose for hypocrites to pick up if they dare.
* * * •
Then the stranger goes on to tell Peter stories—
about an old woman and a young one who
escaped the English slaughter, and how the old
woman starved herself to death so that the young
woman might bring forth her baby, and Peter
happens to have met that identical young woman
with her baby—he had a mate with him . . . and
she was young and pretty . . . and, well . . ,
they didn’t shoot her ; and about a Cape minister
who denounced Cecil Rhodes from the pulpit;
and about many other things—dragged in regard-
less of proportion or probability. And gradually
a great change is worked in Peter Simon. Before
the stranger came he has been considering how he
would float a big mining company and become a
multi-millionaire like Rhodes : now he offers to
join the stranger’s company, which seems to con-
sist principally of poor and afflicted persons who
die off before the regular insurance-table age.
And then—
A curious warmth and gladness stole over Peter Halket
as he knelt; it was like when, as a little child, his mother
folded him to her: he saw nothing more about him but a
soft bright light. Yet in it he heard a voice cry, “ Be-
cause thou hast loved mercy—and hated oppression "
When Trooper Peter Halket raised himself, he saw the
figure of the stranger passing from him. He cried, “My
Master, let me go with you.” But the figure did not
turn; And, as it passed into the darkness, it seemed to
Peter Halket that the form grew larger and larger: and
as it descended the further side of the koppje it seemed
that for one instant he still saw the head with a pale,
white light upon it: then it vanished.
And Trooper Peter Halket sat alone upon the koppje.
* • * •
Here endeth the first part of the story, com-
prising about seven-tenths of the whole. Its
artistic falsity should be apparent. Th 6 characters
and scenes have to be real and natural, or there is
no force in them—they uselessly beat the air. And
they do actually pretend to be real and natural,
and the author strives hard by many clever little
touches to make them seem so. But the trance
kills the unity. Even conceding the point whether
Peter Halket would dream in such fashion, he
could not possibly dream such things—things
alien to him, above his capacity, which he has
never seen or heard of. So" the reader falls be-
tween two .stools. Halket’s hands pull him this
way, and Schreiner’s voice that way; he drops
the substance, yet cannot reach the shadow ; the
wolf’s eyes persist in glaring under grandmam-
ma’s nightcap. The result is a target missed, un
coup manque.
The second part dates a few days further on.
Under the river bank, Halket’s companions have
caught the identical nigger the stranger men-
tioned—the precise one, as Peter believes, who ran
away with his best girl, and into his head he has
vowed to put a bullet. But Peter is not the Peter
of yore. He has been a changed man since that
night on the veld. And when the martinet captain
announces that the nigger is to be hanged in
the morning Peter is suddenly moved to protest,
and preaches his captain a sermon about the duty
of loving one’s black brethren, winding up with
an appeal to let this particular black brother go
free. When the captain gets all his oaths out he
announces a slight change of programme—Peter
will shoot the black brother in the morning. But
in the night Peter gets up and lets him loose ; off
he bounds ; out comes the captain with his re-
volver—Pop ! —and Peter goes into a trance for
good. He is quietly buried ; and the Chartered
Company asks no questions. End of Trooper
Peter Halket of Mashonaland.
4— _
And so passes away Olive’s glory—unless
‘ Peter Halket ’ has been written recently, and is
not identical with the big book (‘From Man to
Man,’ the projected title) on which she was said
to have been at work for meditative years. Olive
is 34 now, and a woman, and married, and her
golden days are over. Much she may write that
is strong and interesting as compared with the
work of others : little, surely, that can favorably
compare with her own. For the flash and fervor
of divine youth have left her, and she is a woman,
and married, and 34. How sad that any clever
person should ever be married and 34, when there
are so many dull persons who are unmarried and
merely 21 or so ! But, after all, to have written
Ihe Story of an African Farm ’ is glory enough
for any single individual. What millions of un-
distinguished embers glow and fade before a clear
jet of flame lightens humanity like that magni-
ficent book !

But few of noted specialists have sprung- into pre-emi-
nence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Coilins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally*a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed iu an
acute or chronic case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best friend
and benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair both
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or the proper enjoyment of life if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidneys, *loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently accompanied by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of middle-aged
men, as well of young’ men, his success has been almost
invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female complaints,
liver, lung, chest,/throat, stomach, bladder, kidney and heart
disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele and kidney troubles.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
FREEDOM.
Thus said the Gods : “Let us bind the soul of man in
chains lest he become a God even as we.” So forged they
the fetters of love and fear and hope and hate and faith
that no man might be free.
How shall a man unravel
The skein of >things aright,
Untouched of joy or travail,
Undazed of any light?
How shall he outline surely
From all illusion free
The bare Truth veiled obscurely
In all that seems to be ?
When Faith hath ceased to cumber,
When Fear hath failed to quell,
When Death is one with Slumber,
When Heaven is one with Hell.
When Love’s last link is broken,
When Hope’s last lure is slain,
Shall wake the word unspoken
That trembles in his brain.
Unspurred of fierce ambition,
Un vexed of vain desire,
The wail of weak contrition,
The wave of fruitless ire ;
Through the vast Cosmic Temple
His thought shall wander free,
Till Truth has laid the kernel bare
In all that seems to be.
Queensland.

Those big brown eyes
With fervors flashing bright
From fires behind, that to my own each night
Responsive rise! —
Dearer to me by far
Are they than gold and flawless rubies are,
ijf Those big brown eyes.
To purblind eyes
A blur of blending blue
Appears the loveliest scene man ever knew —
Seas smudged with skies —
Until the lens before
Them rises to cast bursts of beauty o’er
The purblind eyes.
So big brown eyes
Have shown to me the truth
Of love, of life, of passion and of youth ;
The mantling lies
Have flown the world since I have seen it through
Those big brown eyes.

THE POWER OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE.
“The strong God Circumstance.” — Vedas.
A raindrop fell from the asphodel
Deeps of the summer sky ;
In the scoriae bed on Vesuvius side,
In the lambent lap of the lava tide
It sank to die.
A raindrop fell in the snowy bell
Of a fairy flower ;
It glistened and gleamed in its beauty there
Like a diamond decking a forehead fair
In the bridal hour.
A raindrop fell in a sheeny shell
By Oman’s wave ;
It softly slept ’neath the watery whirl
Of the dreamy deep and woke—a pearl
In Ocean cave.

LAST NIGHT!
Last night, when the moon rose—round and
white—
Over the crest of the distant hill,
You sang your song to us there last night
When the sleeping world lay hushed and stiM.
Oh, why did the scented breezes shake
The oak-trees’ foliage then ? I vow
It was that the envious birds should wake
And hear your song ’neath the leafy bough !
They say, in this sunlit Southern land
The birds thereof have been silent long ;
Why they sing no more I understand—
For you have stolen the wild birds’ song !
Ah, I saw the bright stars wane—and swoon,
And heard the murmurous night-wind sigh !
You sang your song—and the placid moon
Trembled and paled in the soft grey sky.
You sang last night, and the saddened bird
Away to her leaf-hid nestlings flew,
Knowing their music would ne’er be heard
Since Heaven had given their songs—to you !
N.S.W.
THE BREAKER.
Maoriland has finally got level with
Stephen Bosher, or thinks it has, and he is to be
duly hanged. Bosher is supposed to have broken
into the house of old Jones at Petone, and mur-
dered him and his wife, after first blinding them
with pepper. Almost the only direct evidence
against him was that of his wife, and to make her
an available witness the police patiently dug out
the fact that Bosher had a previous wife living,
got him two years for bigamy, and nullified his
second marriage. Then the alleged Mrs.
Bosher No. 2 proceeded to tell things,
with the above result. The first suspicion
about the bigamy arose through Bosher, while
drunk, making ill-regulated observations to
his second wife ; if he had been a sober, teetotal
man the murder of old Jones, of Petone, might
have remained unavenged for ever. Bosher, by
the way, was quite sober when he killed Jones.
Apparently it wasn’t drink that caused the
murder, whereas it ' certainly was drink that
brought it to light, so the usual moral lesson
doesn’t come in here at all.

SATURDAY, APRIL 10, 1897.
The Provincial Standpoint.
Edmund Barton, the leader of the Federal
Contention and probably the most influential
Federationist in Australia, has definitely
thrown in his lot with the semi-provincial
crowd which desires to keep the railways of
the mainland under five conflicting manage-
ments. This pronouncement may not un-
likely turn the scale in favor of provin-
cialism ; things were otherwise so evenly
balanced that it is just possible Mr. Bar-
ton’s voice might have turned it either way.
The reasons given by the Federal leader for
his decision are singularly unsatisfactory ; in
fact, they could serve rather better as reasons
for federating the railway systems than for
keeping them in their present state of chaos.
They suggest that the great advocate of
Federation has studied the legal and con-
stitutional aspect of his subject a great deal,
and the financial aspect of it very little
indeed. According to the Sydney Daily
Telegraph’s report, Mr. Barton’s theory is
as follows :
It was a pleasure to find that such a large number of
members of the Convention thought that the railways
should remain the property of the States. There was one
argument in regard to railways which could scarcely be
resisted. It was conceded that the lands were to remain
the property of the provinces, because it was conceded
that the Federation had more to do with the external
outlook, whilst the provinces would have more to do with
local and provincial affairs, and amongst these latter
necessarily and inevitably were the lands of the provinces.
If the lands were not to pass they must consider what
the railways were created for. Were they not the very
instruments for the development of those lands, just as
the roads were, and nobody thought for one instant of
handing over the roads and bridges to the Federation.
The railways were instituted for just the same purposes
as the roads and bridges. The railways were inherently
provincial and not Federal properties. ... It would
be with a considerable lack of that local knowledge
necessary for their proper management. If ever the rail-
ways were taken over, it would be when the people were
accustomed to look on them from a standpoint which had
not yet been reached. In the Draft Bill of 1891 there was
a clause that seemed to be particularly applicable for
that purpose. That was, in effect, that at any time a
majority of both Houses in each State might refer to the
Federal authority any matter which they thought could
be better dealt with by the Federal authority than by the
States. Let them wait until that time came.
The Bulletin submits that this reasoning
is absurd, inconclusive and irrelevant. The
railways are certainly “intended for the
development of the lands,” but they are no
more “inherently provincial” than are the
posts and telegraphs, which are to be handed
over to the Federal Government. These were
also intended for the development of the
province which created them. The iron
roads of any province are just as strictly
provincial as its customs revenue, its excise,
its defences, and everything belonging to it,
and no more so. There is nothing “ in-
herently provincial ” about any of them, nor
about the roads and bridges, nor even about
the public lands. In The Bulletin’s
opinion there is nothing inherently provincial
about anything, in fact; everything that is
done or left undone in any province affects
the prosperity and happiness, present or
future, of every other province and every
inhabitant in every other province. There-
fore, everything is inherently Federal to
begin with, right down to the culvert at
Cow Flat, and the bad state of the dirt road
at Brown’s Plains, and the lamentable
absence of a log bridge at Borrolloola.
But as the Federal Government can’t keep
its personal eye on all these things, it pro-
poses to delegate some of them, such as
roads, bridges, and control of State lands, to
the Provincial Governments, and the Pro-
vincial Governments, being also unable to
personally supervise all their responsibilities,
delegate some of their functions to municipal
councils, shire councils, divisional boards,
&c. But there is nothing inherently pro-
vincial about anything ; the division of duties
is a mere matter of convenience and policy.
» * * »
The term “ inherently provincial ” applies
to the railways less fittingly than to almost
anything else. The idea of the great means
of communication the permanent link
which binds the States together—being
purely provincial, sounds almost ludicrous.
The railways were created, in part, at least,
as Mr. Barton alleges, “ for the develop-
ment of the lands.” And, thanks to provin-
cial management, they have developed them
about as badly as could possibly be imagined,
and will probably continue to do so. Pro-
vincial management develops the lands
about Jerilderie by loading them with
freights for 412 miles to Sydney, whereas
Federal management, which took no notice
of provincial boundaries, would make a con-
nection about 160 miles long with Melbourne.
It develops the lands about Hay by bur-
dening the produce with 454 miles of freight
when about 200 miles is all that is neces-
sary. It develops the lands west of
Hay by refusing them any railways
at all, because a connection with Syd-
ney is too expensive, and because the
great maxim of provincial management is to
see these districts and all other districts
darned before it will supply a connection
with the easily accessible ports of South
Australia, or any other place outside the
province. All the north-west of Victoria
remains undeveloped, because a railway to
Melbourne would be long and expensive and
probably unprofitable, and the general tenor
of provincial management is to see the north-
west or any other place in Hades rather than
build a few cheap branch lines to afford
access to the adjacent South Australian
ports. It would be interesting to know how
much more the lands of south-western New
South Wales would be worth if they were
only 150 to 200 miles by rail from a seaport,
as they would be under a Federal railway
system that was not bound by provincial
interests and provincial boundaries, instead
of over 400 miles, as necessitated by the
present mode of “development.” Also,
how much more the lands of western New
South Wales and western Victoria and south-
western Queensland would be worth if they
had railway communication —which could be
easily and cheaply provided under a Fedei’al
railway policy—instead of having none at all,
which is, and seems likely to be for many
years, their fate under the provincial method.
Then it would be interesting to further esti-
mate how much this increase would add to
the total wealth of the country, to the land
revenue and land and income tax returns of
the provinces, to their population, to their
capacity for supplying employment, and
many other things. Provincial management
develops the country well enough in the
districts for which the provincial ports are
the natural outlet. Beyond that limit it
either does it very badly or not at all.
* * * *
It is not only Federal control of existing
lines that is wanted but—what is much more
important—Federal control of construction.
Failing that the new lines in the western
Riverina will all be built pointing north-
eastward to Sydney, instead of south-east-
ward towards Melbourne ; and those of
north-western Victoria will be built Mel-
bourne-wards, when their natural direction
is west towards Adelaide, and those of
western New South Wales will point east-
wards over the howling immensity of the
plains instead of taking the short road which
Nature has marked out for them towards
Spencer’s Gulf. The whole of three im-
portant railway systems will be slewed
round the wrong way ; many needless
millions will be wasted in building super-
fluous miles of line; many more millions or
scores of millions will be wasted, for scores
of years thereafter, in carrying goods need-
less distances ; the burden of these extra
charges will keep the inland districts poor,
retard development, permanently reduce
land-values, hamper industries, diminish
the State revenues, and keep the
country hungry and unprogressive. And
by forcibly dragging the trade of each
province to its own provincial city regardless
of natural tendencies, the fusion of the Aus-
tralian people will be retarded, and the
separation into distinct and semi-hostile com-
munities will be accentuated and made moie
permanent. The abolition of border tariffs
is intended to obliterate boundaries and let
trade, within Australia, go where it will.
The great object of the railway system is to
make trade go where it doesn’t want to, by
opening lines in that direction, and to pre-
vent it taking its natural course by refusing
to build railways to connect with anywhere
save the local capital.
* * • *
The only way to develop the lands is to
afford means for carrying the produce of the
lands to a market as cheaply as possible, and
the essential of cheapness is economy of
distance. Railways alone don’t necessarily
develop the lands. If the wool - growing
regions of the Riverina were “ developed ”
by a railway which had one end at J erilderie
and the other at Perth, it would be a very
great and long and wonderful railway, but,
as the freights upon it would probably absorb
more than the value of the wool carried, it
wouldn’t develop the country worth a straw.
This is an extreme illustration, but it is
just what the provincial railway manage-
ments are doing, though they do it on a
smaller scale, every day, and what they pro-
pose to keep on doing indefinitely.
* * * *
Mr. Barton opposes railway federation for
the additional reason that a central manage-
ment would lack the “local knowledge”
necessary to control so vast an undertaking.
If this argument were applied all round it
would lead to interesting results. The
Federal post and telegraph boss, for instance,
will not have a complete local knowledge of
every place in Australia, so presumably he
will depend on trusted subordinates who,
being in charge of different districts, can
supply the required knowledge. Similarly,
a Federal railway manager would presumably
have the continent divided into districts,
with men something like Eddy and Mathie-
son in charge, and they would have their
capable subordinates in charge of sub-dis-
tricts, and the “ local knowledge ” would be
supplied very much as it is at present. The
Federal Public Works Committee, or some
analogous body, could easily be constituted
to include members from each province, and
with a local knowledge of each province. It
couldn’t be any more absurd than it is in
New South Wales at present, when purely
city men have to decide re the construction
of lines in districts which some of them
never saw, and gather their informa-
tion at the best by flying visits, in
the course of which they look at en-
gineering problems of which they know
nothing, and decide on sight whether soil of
which they are quite ignorant will grow
vegetables that they are wholly unacquainted
with.
* * * *
There are any number of ways by which,
if it is so desired, provincial interests
can be preserved, and the construction ex-
penditure allotted on a reasonably equitable
scale. But the three essentials are that
fares and freights shall be made uniform ;
that there shall be one railway gauge and
one only throughout Australia ; and that all
future lines shall be built to give the pro-
ducer the best and cheapest and shortest
outlet for his produce, and that the back
country shall no longer be sacrificed to the
interests of the cities and the city traders.
If these things can be done otherwise than
by Federal control, The Bulletin would
much like to know how. Mr. Barton’s
theory is that Australia should wait until the
people are accustomed to look at the matter
from a very different standpoint. The
answer to this can be put in four proposi-
tions : (1) There isn’t likely to be any time
within the next 500 years when Sydney and
Melbourne, with their adjacent districts,
won’t have a controlling vote in their
respective provinces ; (2) There isn’t likely
to be any time inside 1000 years or more
when these cities won’t want to drag all the
trade of their provinces to Sydney and Mel-
bourne, no matter who suffers ; (3) if it
would cost £5,000,000 to make a uniform
gauge now, by waiting for Federal control
till people look at the matter from a new
standpoint the time will come when it will
cost £10,000,000; if the standpoint is waited
for long enough the cost will be £100,000,000
or more ; (4) while the new standpoint is
being waited for the railway system is going
further and further askew, and becoming
more costly and useless and circuitous ; and
the districts whose natural outlet is by
lines running north and south are being sup-
lied with political railways running east and
west, and vice versa; and the development
of the interior is being shamefully retarded.
Also, it may be remarked that the way to
make the people look at the matter from a
national standpoint, which Mr. Barton
seems to vaguely admit as being desirable,
is to teach them to do so, and Mr. Barton’s
advocacy of the narrow provincial standpoint
doesn’t help much in this direction.
A Hard Knot
Ihe situation with regard to Premier Reid s
visit to England to join in the Record Reign
celebration grows more weirdly complicated as
time goes on. There are about a dozen different
aspects of it, and each one, when carefully con-
sidered, looks more tangled than the others.
Ihe Bulletin hereby proceeds to sort them
out—or to attempt doing so—and to show as
exactly as possible how New South Wales’
troubled little fat man really stands, or, rather,
how he wobbles, as he isn’t standing just now
in any definite sense.
* * * *
The other Premiers propose—if their present
intentions are not altered by circumstances— to
each appoint an understudy who will do duty
in his chief’s absence. Fysii, Isaacs and
Holder will probably fill the vacant places in
the three Southern provinces. The respective
Parliaments will, therefore, sit and go on with
public business as usual. If the Convention
has finished drafting the Federal Constitution
before the Premiers depart, it will be put
through its Parliamentary stages in their
absence, so that when the various bosses return
it will be possible, so far as their provinces are
concerned, to call the Convention together
almost immediately for its second session, and
go on with the work as expeditiously
as if there had been no Record Reign
grovel at all. Premier Reid is, for the
present at least, the one obstacle in the way
of this very simple and common-sense arrange-
ment. His purpose is to adjourn the N.S.W.
Legislature until his return ; therefore, when he
comes back it will only begin to discuss the
Federal Constitution ; and the other provinces
and the Convention and the whole business of
Federation will have to wait for six or eight
weeks until N.S.W. is ready to go on. Under
these circumstances the other Premiers may
possibly abandon the plan of allowing their
Legislatures to discuss the Constitution Bill in
their absence ; if they have to wait till the one
backward province of N.S.W. catches up there
is little or nothing to be gained by it. But the
fact will remain that they signified their will-
ingness to act on this basis, and Premier Reid
blocked the way. Therefore, Reid will be held
up to obloquy in the other provinces, and by
the Opposition in his own province, as the one
utterly selfish groveller who suspended the
most urgent business that Australia ever had
on hand, and put great national interests at
hazard, solely that he might have his own pri-
vate and individual and selfish grovel in peace.
Possibly the other Premiers only made their
offer by way of striking an attitude, and for
purposes of advt., and will be glad of an excuse
to go back from it. Still the fact remains that
they did make it, and that G. Reid was the sole
dissentient.
* * * *
Premier Reid’s great reason for going to
England, according to his own statement, was
that the rest of the Premiers were going ; that
Federation would necessarily be hung up in
their absence ; and that even if he remained and
tugged alone at the weary oar of politics, and
pushed the Constitution Bill through his own
Legislature, he would have to wait for the other
Parliaments, and nothing would be gained by his
haste. Now it appears that he would not
have to wait for the other Parliaments, as
they are willing to go straight on just
as if there was nothing unusual in the
way, and this extinguishes one of Reid’s
great reasons why he should go. Also, it
appears that the other Parliaments will have to
wait for New South Wales, which, by his own
logic, is a most powerful reason why Reid
should not go. Yet apparently he is going all
the same, though he has now no excuse worth
mentioning save that he wants to go, after his
repeated assurances that he didn’t really want
to go at all.
* * * *
G. H. Reid is at a further disadvantage as
compared with his fellow-grovellers that are to
be. He is the one Premier of the seven who
laid it down as an immutable axiom (in Dibbs’s
case) that no head of a Government should go
away bent on loyal gush and holiday-making,
taking the Premiership with him. Yet that is
just what Reid himself proposes to do. More-
over, Dibbs did not keep public business wait-
ing his convenience as Reid intends doing—the
Legislature met as usual with Barton in
charge, and went on with its ordinary work.
And even if Dibbs had suspended all legislative
business till his return, his offence, about which
Reid made so much complaint, would have
been very trifling by comparison, for there was
no public business then on hand of one-tenth
the importance of that which Reid desires to
hang up while he is away doing his little piece
of abasement. Moreover, any business that
was on hand then was Netv South Wales busi-
ness only—not that of all Australasia. If G. H.
Reid takes the Premiership to England, and
hangs up Federation indefinitely to do it, and
thereby forces the other provinces to hang it up
indefinitely also, especially after the view he
took of Dibbs’s conduct, he will furnish bis
opponents with a fair excuse to heave mud and
scorn and verbal dead cat at him, and to call him
a time-server and an opportunist and a hypo-
crite, for the rest of his political career. And
if he changes his course of action at this late
hour, it will be so obviously done through fear
of consequences that he will lose the holiday
and the grovel, while the dead-cat will be very
little alleviated.
* * * *
The apparently obvious way out of one, at
least, of the difficulties of the case, would be
for Premier Reid to allow Parliament to sit
and business to proceed while he is away, and
thus keep New South \Vale3 in line with the
other States, and avoid any serious delay in
Federal matters. Unfortunately, his position
is so very different from that of the other
Premiers that he can’t well do this. Turner
will presumably leave Isaacs in charge, and
Isaacs is strong, brilliant, resourceful and
moderately safe. Fysh is a reasonably strong
and eminently safe man, who will keep Brad-
don’s seat about as secure for him as Brad DON
could himself. Holder, Kingston’s under-
study, is also reasonably strong and eminently
reliable, and both he and Fysh are veteran ex-
Premiers, who know thoroughly what they
have to do. Reid, on the other hand, would
presumably have to depute his authority to old,
weak, fuzzy Brunker, who is neither strong
nor experienced, and whose knowledge of
politics consists mostly of a harmless gift for
dealing in cows and auctioning produce. It i s
one thing to leave Holder to keep an eye on
“Turncoat Bill” Copley, or the brilliant Isaacs
to suppress that broken reed, John MTntyre,
and quite another to leave the well-meaning
but dismally commonplace Brunker to run
the campaign against that astute, scheming,


ever-wakeful, and not too scrupulous veteran,
W J. Lyne. Again, each of the other
Premiers leaves his locum tenens with a solid
majority behind him; Reid doesn’t—he is
largely dependent on the support of the Third
Party, and there is absolutely no knowing what
Lyne might do, or Brunkbr might not do with
it in his absence. The Third Party avowedly
gives support in return for democratic conces-
sions, and Lyne might offer it the earth while
Reid was away, as the price of its vote, and the
spectacle of Brunker conducting a delicate
counter-negotiation would be something for the
gods to weep over.
* * • •
Still another trouble. The leader of the
Opposition in each of the other provinces
approves, more or less reluctantly, of the Pre-
mier’s departure, and promises not to harass
the Government in his absence. Lyne doesn’t
approve and won’t promise anything. His atti-
tude in this matter is quite natural and remark-
ably human. M‘lntyre, Lewis, and Copley
have no specially large and effective brick to
throw in the absence of their three Premiers,
for neither Turner, Braddon, or Kingston
has given his enemies such a handle as
Reid did in re the case of his predeces-
sor, Dibbs. Having no brick worth speak-
ing of to throw, they make no sacrifice in
promising not to throw it. Lyne, having
the largest and most effective brick to
throw that he ever handled, naturally re-
fuses to promise anything about not throwing
it. To approve of Reid’s visit to England
would mean giving up all right to jeer at his
enemy about his change of front, and to say the
same things to him that he said to Lyne’s late
chief a few years ago, and Lyne, naturally
enough, doesn’t feel like surrendering so beauti-
ful an opportunity without any compensation.
Therefore, if Reid shuts up Parliament and
goes he will be gibed at as the man who sacri-
ficed the interests of five provinces for the sake
of his own private grovel at the foot of the
British throne, and who went back on all the
beautiful principles that he laid down so
forcibly for Dibbs’s guidance. And if he goes
without shutting up Parliament, Brunker
will probably let the Ministry go to pieces
in his absence, and, in addition to the
obloquy, he may lose his billet. And if he
doesn’t go, after all, he will lose his share of
the great holiday outbreak, and will appear as
a man who hadn’t principle enough to do what
he said was right, or courage enough to do
what he knew was wrong. Altogether there
are more different aspects about Premier
Reid’s present position than it is easy to count.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Clroumlocution in the Commonwealth.
Item from report of the Convention debate on
the best means of remedying deadlocks between
the two Houses of the Federal Legislature : — 1
Mr. O’Connor’s method of getting over a deadlock
between the two Houses was also unique. He would
allow the two Chambers to meet in conference with equal
powers of voting, and let the majority decide. Mr.
Isaacs and other Victorian representatives at once
pointed out that that would enable a minority in the
Assembly to defeat the Government. Mr. O’Connor
admitted that his plan would be open to that objection,
and in reply to an interjection by Sir Graham Berry, he
admitted that a new Government would have to be
formed, which would go to the country on the point in
dispute. “Then you must go to the people, after all,”
observed the Victorian Speaker, and seeing how he was
unconsciously advocating the referendum, Mr. O’Connor
changed the subject.
Query : why would a new Government have to
be formed ? If a small majority in the Assem-
bly was in favor of something, and a large
majority in the Senate was against it, and when
the two Houses sat and voted together the
majority in the Senate and the minority in the
Assembly combined came out on top, why
should not the Government go on with business
as if nothing had happened, and trust to the
next election to put a new complexion on
things ? The Convention, however, practically
agreed that the simple plan of both Houses
sitting together to vote on disputed points was
unworkable, and the general opinion favored
instead an elaborate scheme put forward by
Premier Turner, as follows :
To have a dissolution of both Houses in cases of irre-
concileable differences; and in the event of both Cham-
bers returning from their respective constituents with the
mandate still to differ, the matter in dispute is then to be
submitted to a popular Referendum, both of the States
and of the whole populace. This would supply absolute
finality. For example, we may take female suffrage as a
case in point. Suppose the National Assembly had
passed the Bill, and the States Council had thrown
it out. Neither would give way after confer-
ence. Then the Governor-General, in terms of
the constitution, would dissolve both Chambers.
Members would go for re-election, making this question
the sole battle ground. Popular opinion would be
focussed on it. But it might happen that when the new
Houses were constituted they would be still in antagon-
ism. In that case the question “Yes” or “No” would
be put to the individual voters of all the States separately
and of all the States combined. If out of five colonies
three States gave a majority for the Bill in the aggregate,
as well as a separate majority in each colony, then
Woman’s Suffrage would become law ; but if a majority
of the whole body of electors resident in two colonies only
were to vote for the Bill, and the majority in three colo-
nies, though a minority of the whole, were to vote against
it, then the Bill would be lost.
The brilliant feature of this scheme, as shown
in the italicised sentence, is that, after all this
trouble and circumlocution, the minority in the
Assembly could defeat the Government just the
same. If the Assembly favored anything it
would mean, in a general way, that the majority
of the people were for it; if the Senate opposed
it, that would mean that a majority of the
States were against it. If the two Houses
then voted together the majority of States
might override the majority of men. Turner’s
elaborate and costly referendum provides that
there must be a majority both of people and of
States to carry the measure by a popular vote,
therefore the majority of States may vote dow’n
the majority of people again. It is exactly
the same result arrived at differently, with
much waste of money and profanity, and with
an expenditure of two months’ time instead of
two hours.
A Great Waste of Figures.
One financial aspect of Federation which calls
for more anathema than the average is the
making of elaborate calculations, and the build-
ing up of elaborate tables, to show how much
each province will contribute to the Customs
revenue when a uniform tariff is enforced. The
beginning of these masses of confusion is the
following set of propositions : Each province
imports goods to such and such a value ; it has
a certain tariff; the tariff yields so much per
annum. If the W.A. tariff is applied all round
N.S.W. will pay more than it now does and
Victoria will pay less. If the S. A. tariff is ap-
plied all round N.S.W. and Westralia will both
pay more than they do. If the Tasmanian
tariff is applied all round, all the mainland
provinces will pay more than thej r now do, and
the amount they will pay works out to some-
thing incredible. These theories are all based
on the assumption that, if 10 per cent, duties
yield so much, 20 per cent, duties will yield
twice as much, which is just as logical as
arguing that, if a man is bitten by one dog on
the first day of the month, he will necessarily
be bitten by three dogs on the third. Tariffs
don’t work out that way, and all the calcula-
tions based upon the assumption that they do
are waste-paper. No one knows with any
accuracy what a tariff will yield until
it is tried. When the Dibbs Government
came into power it doubled and trebled
the duties, and, in two or three years, when the
country adapted itself to its new conditions, the
new tariff yielded just about 10 per cent, more
than the old one—not twice as much, or any-
thing like it. The Victorian tariff is several
times as heavy as that of N.S. Wales, and last
financial year it yielded less in the bulk than
the N.S. Wales one, and only per cent, more
in proportion to population. As a matter of
figures it should have yielded 100 or 200 per
cent, more, but it didn’t. The Westralian tariff
is lighter than that of Victoria, and it produces
four times as much, in proportion to population.
No one knows, until it is tried, what any scale
of duties will yield, or what any province will
pay under it, or will lose or gain by it; but the
general result seems to be that, if a uniform
scale is applied throughout Australia, after a
few years the country will adapt itself to its
new conditions, and the burden will be much
the same all round. The rest is mostly wasted
figures.
The Case of God!
Dear Bulletin, — God’s all right, now 1 —
“ the churches ” have taken up His case.
“ We’ll pull You through,” they are telling
Him. “ You are the Almighty Ruler of the
Universe—holding all things in the hollow of
your hand—but we'll see to it that You are not
snubbed by being dropped out of the Federal
Constitution. Infinite, Eternal and Omniscient
—only keep up Your courage, and we’ll take
care that You’re not left out in the cold ! ” All
which appears to be playing it pretty low down
on the God of the Old Testament; the ferocious
God that revelled in the massacre of women
and children ; the peevish God that was
always on the prowl for affronts to His
dignity ; the paltry God that was so much exer-
cised over priestly pots and pans and petti-
coats. For this is the God the churches want
“ recognised ” —less, apparently, upon the
assumption that, if He isn’t allowed to figure
in the bill, He may get mad and burst-up the
show, than upon the ground that, as He has so
long played a leading part in the Great Farce,
it would hardly be civil to leave Him out of the
cast at this time of day. But it is mere moss-
grown medisevalism to attempt to force recogni-
tion of the Pentateuchal monstrosity upon men
to whom He would be simply a devil, and who,
regarding the Supreme Being as absolutely
irrelative and conditionless, can’t help smiling
at the notion of His being angry or pleased, in-
jured or benefited, ignored or “recognised.”
To men of this stamp the amenities orthodoxy
is certain to lavish upon them will bring
no surprise. They will fully expect to have
their motives misrepresented in the name of
Gawd, their characters blackened for the
Deity’s sake—to be promptly relegated to the
“zealot’s ready hell,” and denounced as
“ enemies of religion ” for being rejectors of a
barbarous and brutal theology which is itself the
worst enemy of religion. But, since it is by
deeds, not by beliefs, men have to be judged,
and, since the actions of the man who can’t
swallow the Fiend-GOD compare favorably for
the most part with those of the man who still
rejoices in the hope of hell-fire for the majority,
it would be a mere useless impertinence to
attempt to impose officially upon the former
any endorsement of the crass theological
conceptions of his intellectual inferiors.
You can’t squeeze the greater into the less ; and
it is an unmistakeable step backwards towards
intellectual darkness to attempt to “ recognise ”
nationally any God that could be so recognised,
or that could want to be so recognised, or that
could be conceived of as wanting to be so recog-
nised by the inconceivably unimportant life-
atoms on one of the pettiest units of, probably,
one of the most insignificant sun - systems
amongst an incalculable multitude of such sys-
tems in an unthinkably infinite universe. Man
is a circumstance—cursed with the conceit that
he is the circumstance ! And when he shall
have completely outgrown that delusion he will
have found God —not got rid of Him I—Sar-
donyx.
“ Agitator ” Fleming is making a strong at-
tempt to shift Labor-member Trenwith from
his pedestal. In the first place, Fleming,
“ speaking from personal experience as a work-
ing bootmaker,” contradicted Trenwith’s very
questionable statement that high wages ruled
in the Melbourne boot - trade. Fleming
since then has prepared a list of aspersions on
Trenwith’s democratic character, and, with
the assistance of the Freetraders, it is quite
possible that the aggrieved agitator may get
his knife fairly into Trenwith’s ribs by next
election-day. TheMelb. working-man is, mean-
while, told (by Fleming) that Trenwith was a
violent anti-Homeßule spouter at the time of the
Redmond Bros.’ visit to Australia, when sym-
pathy with Irish tenants happened to be
unfashionable, owing to the recent murder of a
landlord or two. If the utterance, at any time,
of an Orangemanic oration can be proved
against Trenwith, he will seem a decidedly
unsuitable leader for a Labor-party. As for
the suggestion that he “saves himself from
exposure by crying or pretending to cry ” (on
the subject of his eyesight), it is a paltry and
cowardly-looking charge to put into print, even
though the afflicted man’s enemies may almost
persuade themselves of its truth. Touching
which matter The Bulletin hears that Tren-
with’s eyes were not greatly improved by the
cataract operation performed in London and
declared by cable to have been a complete suc-
cess. Since his return to Melbourne he has
made up his mind to undergo another opera-
tion, without travelling further than Collins-
street for the ordeal.

Melbourne Champion reckons that Gillies
will be leader of the Tory party in next Yic.
Parliament, vice MTntyre, gone out on his ear,
and that the old Parliamentary hand will be a
dangerous opponent for the Turner Ministry.
This paper ventures to bet a small sum that, if
Turner keeps his health and physical vigor,
he will tramp right through the fine-spun webs
of the artful Gillies and leave nothing of them
but fragments. Gillies knows how to out-
manoeuvre another web-spinner like himself,
therefore when he ran against inferior schemers
such as Munro he looked something above the
average. But a man like Turner, who doesn’t
diplomatise and scheme, and fish for votes, and
buy support with jobs, and angle with smellful
bait in troubled waters, but goes straight
through everything, will utterly upset Dun-
can’s apple-cart. What’s the good of Gillies
being an expert at the three-card trick if the
other man won’t play ?
The Federal Convention, according to reports
in Monday’s S.M. Herald, has struck the
exact difficulty which this paper foretold when
it lately wrote about “ The Tasmanian Fly-
speck.” Tasmania, it finds, is the great diffi-
culty in the way of fixing up a workable con-
stitution. The less populous provinces want
equal representation in the Federal Senate,
and no one objects to it in the case of South
Australia, Westralia and Queensland, because
they will inevitably grow to be at least as
populous as N.S. Wales and Yictoria, and
any inequality will adjust itself by-and-bye.
Everybody objects to it, however, more or
less in Tasmania’s case, because Tasmania is so
small that it can never hold half as much popu-
lation as even the smallest of the mainland
provinces, and under the equal-representation
system it will be a permanent anomaly. If
Tasmania were combined with Victoria the
two would, in area, make a respectable pro-
vince ; at present the situation is rather ridicu-
lous. The sleepy isle makes the third small
province in the Convention, and it thus enables
the small provinces to outvote the large ones. Its
presence seems to have burst up all hope of rail-
way federation ; its own railways are cut off from
those of the mainland, so most of the advan-
tages of Federal management would not directly
affect it; therefore its attitude on the subject
is one of blank indifference or hostility. If
Tasmania would amalgamate with Victoria all
these difficulties would be settled and a lot of
money saved in unnecessary government as
well. The united province, by the way, might
be called Tasmania, that being a sensible sort
of name with some eternal fitness about it. And
the island itself might be specifically named
Dobson, which would also have a lot of eternal
fitness about it. It is already Dobson to all
intents and purposes.
At time of going to press it was reported that
the financial committee of the Convention had
decided to throw up all idea of railway federa-
tion, and was also fast tending towards a
decision to throw up the idea of consolidating
the public debts. If it carries out the latter
idea it will have got over about two-thirds of
the questions it was appointed to solve by the
simple and effective process of throwing them
up, and it will be remembered hereafter as the
great unanimous chucker-up of Australia. The
futility of it was partly owing, no doubt, to
the policy of putting the mediocrities who knew
nothing of finance on the monetary branch of the
business, and putting the most promising finan-
cier of the crowd on the judicial committee; also,
Barton’s luckless pronouncement in favor of
provincial railway management probably had
something to do with it. The reason ascribed
for giving up the railway question is that
“ there are various serious difficulties in the
way.” Everybody knew that, but the Conven-
tion was created for the express purpose of
tackling the difficulties and getting over them.
If there had been no serious difficulties in the
way there would have been no need for a Con-
vention at all.
“ Gambler ” to The Bulletin
Despite the rejection of the Bill introduced into Vio.
Leg. Assembly last session by Hancock and Sangstkr for
legalising certain so-called “ art-unions,” these gambles
go merrily on. The A.N.A. lottery was lately drawn, and
those of the Eight Hour Committee and Druids shortly
will be. Re these affairs, there is much shuffling and
hypocrisy on the part of the Turner Govt. When Han-
cock and Sangster’s Bill for putting the Friendly
Societies’ lotteries on a legal basis came before the House,
Peacock was put up to oppose it; and when a goody-
goody deputation interviewed Turner to ask him to pro-
hibit Friendly Societies holding “ art-unions,” he said
that the prizes must not be in money, or the
authorities would interfere. Yet, after the draw-
ing of the A.N.A. “ art-union,” it was calmly
announced in the Age that the winner of the first prize
of £lOOO would receive a cheque for the amount, and the
Government has not taken the least notice. Of course,
most people can see little harm in a lottery fairly and
squarely conducted ; but there is a good deal of “confi-
dence trick ” about the management of those run by the
A.N.A., Druids, and Eight-Hour committee. No one but
a “mug” would invest in a lottery if he knew that only
about one-fifth of the money paid for tickets went
towards prizes, and that the other four-fifths was annexed
by the promoters for expenses, &c. Yet that is what is
done. A few figures from the report of the Druids’ Gala
for 1896 Tickets sold, 141,448, valued at £7072; prize-
money, £l333—leaving a balance of £5739, of which only
£646 was devoted to charities, the remainder being swal-
lowed up in “ expenses ” and commission. I have seen the
balance-sheets of the other “ art-unions ” referred to, and
they are very similar. This sort of thing is most unfair
to the investing public. Just imagine “ Tattersall ”
Adams running his sweeps on similar lines, and deducting
£BO,OOO out of a £lOO,OOO sweep! He could well afford to
placate Govt, by handing over a few thou, to charities.
The query naturally suggests itself—What becomes of the
money 1 The answer is, that these “ art-unions ” are run
for the benefit of a few favored individuals, who
get nice pickings in the shape of secretaryships,
&c., their remuneration being altogether out of pro-
portion to the value of their services. To give an
idea of the extravagant manner in which the sale of
tickets is conducted, I will again quote from the report
of the Druids’ Gala for’96 : —“ln N.S.W. 25,163 tickets
(value £1258) were sold, and a draft for £503 forwarded.”
In other words, it cost £755 to sell £1258 worth of tickets.
I ask is this sort of thing fair to the investing public ?
Would it not be better to prohibit these miscalled art-
unions altogether, and for Government to hold State lot-
teries ?
Victoria has a 2Jjd. “ National League ” con-
sisting of Brother Walter Madden, a stray
secretary with the unfortunate name of Bald,
and a few sundries. Here is one of Brother
Walter’s remarks (Argus report) to the annual
meeting held recently, at which 25 people
attended: —
Probably the most dangerous plank in the radical plat-
form was “ equal electorates,” and he was astonished to
meet many intelligent men who did not realise what that
meant. At the present time it took approximately about
4000 votes to elect a member of the Assembly in the
larger cities and towns, and about 2000 to elect a member
in the country districts, the reason being that it was con-
sidered twice as easy for men in the cities and towns to
go to the poll as for men in the country districts. If we
had equal electorates, 2000 voters in the cities and towns
would elect a member the same as in the country dis-
tricts, and the latter would be snuffed out. This was an
important point to impress on our country friends.
Since the first lunatic put straw in his hair
there has never been anything much more
childish than Madden’s reason for the ex-
istence of unequal electorates. He might
as well have put it down to the fact
that townspeople drink their milk fresh
from the can. That country constituencies
have smaller voters’ rolls is due to a tra-
dition in favor of the representation of
territory rather than of population. The
observance of such a tradition now would be
charmingly archaic—but the tradition doesn’t
count worth a cent. Nevertheless, dispro-
portionate representation of country districts
will continue awhile with the full approval of
many radicals. It costs now at least J>2oo to
contest a country electorate. Double the
electorate and you double the cost—thus re-
ducing greatly the number of men who are
available for candidates. The question was
discussed during the last session of Vic. Parlia-
ment, and there was no sign of an important
advocacy of equal electorates. Nevertheless,
Madden’s reason for unequal electorates should
be framed as the worst piece of sheer silliness
that has emanated even from the Madden
family.
“The two bye-elections of Romford and
Walthamstow aroused considerable comment and
spread dismay and jubilation alternately in the
Conservative and Liberal camps,” writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent. “ A pre-
vious 2000 - odd Conservative majority was
pulled down to 123 at Romford, and wiped out at
Walthamstow altogether. Sinclair, or Schlesinger,
a German Jew, formerly of Melbourne and the
Abgus, saved one seat for the Conservatives and
squeezed home by the short tip of a long nose
with his day-old naturalisation - papers in his
pocket. Mountain Dewar, of whisky fame, ran
against a sturdy, sensible Radical, and came a
cropper over the passive feet of a local Conserva-
tive boss—a sulky teetotaller. The Radical, Wood,
is a capable man, apparently worth his place in
any Parliamentary boat. His was a glorious
victory. ”
My Lord the Cardinal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My Lord the Cardinal, let me re-echo your
famous sentence,
Couched in the choicest words, breathing the
spirit of charity,
And yet withal, to us, the keynote of your
Federal Address :
“ The man who urges separation from the great
Mother land
Is worse than criminal, aye, even with the
beast, bereft of reason.”
So, so. We’ll paste that gem of wisdom in our
Imperial hats
To keep our aspiring souls from bubbling with
the sentiment
Of Faith in our bright future, Hope for its near
approach,
And Charity, each with the other, when
Nationhood arrives.
You are right, my Lord the Cardinal; your
mundane wisdom
Transcends your saintliness. The man who
has the talent
To show the danger of the present move, and
has not worldly tact
To refrain from doing so, moves us to more
than pity.
What use to us are unborn sons that we should
leave them free ?
Better to pluck the honor that awaits the abdi-
cation of our trust,
The tinsel and the gewgaw show that fills our
soul with pride,
Our fellows with the envy of our indicated
merit, even though
Our land is sacrificed—a nascent Nation for a
bauble.
And yet, my Lord the Cardinal, it was, when
the world was young,
A virtue to revere that shrine where tangents
of the past and present met
And left us smiling. And so on through the-
ages up to—when ?
“ Let all the ends thou aimest at be thy Coun-
try’s, God’s, and Truth’s ”
Was princely counsel for the ardent youth and
chivalry of France.
But we ? We’re nothing—mere outcasts. Our
land a drift of island
In a lonely sea that needs the magic influence
of the North
To vitalise it. And are we, sons of a sterile
land, impotent, too?
If so, effacement is our doom. Let us together
stoop to fate.
And now, My Lord the Cardinal, when once
God came on earth
To shape the destiny of his chosen men, did he
decree
What we in these days call democracy, and its
resultant rule ?
Did this erection flourish till the Jews in flush
of pride
Cried out aloud, “Make us a King as other
Nations” ? for the Jews
Knew more than the Lord of Hosts. They
knew a little more than you
When, fired with Loyalty, you yielded to the
voice of men who sold you
As we would be, did we not know our path is
onward, though great men fall.
Yours is another milestone on our way this
decade.

The Corbett - Fitzsimmons battle will
shortly be reproduced with faithful details at
the Edison Electric Parlor, 162 Pitt-st., Sydney.
It was cabled that the great fight was recorded
all through by the Kinetoscope, and the colonial
branch of the Edison Laboratory before the fight
took place made its arrangements for securing the
record. The Edison Vitascope, Kinetoscope, and
Kinetophone, and the wonderful X-rays are still
on show in the Parlor, and are attracting great
public interest.*

“Sweet Lavender,” staged at Sydney
Criterion for a very short season, enables the
publio to draw comparisons between the Thornton
that is and the one that used to be. The present
Thornton comes out of the scrutiny very well ;
his Dick Phenyl is as fresh and original and in-
teresting and as affably tight as ever he was.
Phenyl is a refreshing change after Joseph Trent,
bookmaker, inasmuch as he is a human drunk
with a great soul, whereas the bookmaker was
more like an automaton with a great soul. There is
a fragrance of stale beer and of old piouldy hat mis-
laid in the ash-barrel about Phenyl, and his soul
is deteriorated somewhat by being left out in the
gutter at night when it was too far gone to get
home on all-fours, but this paper, not being a tee-
total organ, raises no special objection to these
small matters. Dick Phenyl is a solemn warning
against benevolence, inasmuch as that old bar-
rister with vine leaves in his hair is ready to do a
good turn to everybody, and obviously makes
nothing by it. Also, he is a fine example of what
the Prodigal Son looks like when the old original
swine whose company he enjoyed when he was
young are all dead, and he dpesn’t get on with the
new swine, who are fresh, and arrogant about the
tail, and life generally has lost its savour. His
career shows that virtue is not rewarded, inasmuch
as his one piece of good luck comes to him when
he is very drunk and departs before he has time to
get sober. The only people in the play who seem
to prosper much are the old banker who betrayed
the woman who trusted him, and the jumping
American who looks as if his money had been
made out of salt-pork at Chicago. The story has
no particular ending. Nothing special happens to
gladden the life of the. woman who was thrown
out when she was young. The wicked old banker
is left in a state of renewed prosperity. The
character of the jumpy American is not cleared of
the accusation of salt-pork which hangs over him,
and nothing particularly good happens to barrister
Phenyl. Nevertheless, “Sweet Lavender” is
a play that nobody can help loving, and
it is true to Nature, inasmuch as no
story has any definite ending. There always
remains after it the soulless necessity for
all the characters to get up and wash and go to
bed again for forty years or so, just as if there
had never been any story.
* » * *
“Lavender” is full of good parts, and
they are all filled remarkably well. Barrister
Phenyl, comedy cynic, philanthropist, drunk,
philosopher, and many other things, is about the
best character on Thornton’s list, which is saying
a great deal. Miss Noney Seabrooke plays Minnie
as well as she was ever played in Australia—
possibly better; and Miss Bessie Rignold, as
Lavender, though this paper is hardly so badly
mashed on her as it was when she played the
brown maid from Demerara, is excellent as a
whole, and the only specific complaint that
can be laid against her is her hair. Herbert
Terry, who has a tendency to be rather a
colorless young man at times, makes Clement
Hale go quite as well as that rather ordinary
good person can be made to go. If the Amurrikin
of George Rowlands could keep his nose a little
more under control, and didn’t wear quite so
aggressively shiny an aspect, suggestive of a
hurried wash at the kitchen sink, and the ancient
banker looked a trifle more like a person that any
sane depositor would leave his money with, there
would be no fault to find with “ Sweet Lavender.”
Anyhow, both the play and the co. are far above
the average. Even the clever Pinero never wrote
anything prettier than this conventional little tale
of a bad banker, and a noble-hearted drunk, and
a woman who went astray in the old, old, tired
way that women have been straying in since the
days when our remote ancestor, the original seed-
ape of the female persuasion, went wrong during
the Miocene Period, and was scorned by the mega-
therium and other decent society for ever after-
wards.

Westmacott bade good-bye to the stony
paths of theatrical management at Sydney Royal
on Monday afternoon. The farewell took the
shape of a benefit, the show consisting of “ Pene-
lope,” operetta in one act, the comedietta, “A
Show of Hands,” interludes by Charles Godfrey,
Alice Leamar, Coleman, Edgar Granville, the
Allisons, Little Gulliver, Knowles, and Ernest
Fitts, and one act of the “Private Secretary.”
Said act was a beautiful and affecting monument
erected prematurely to the memory of the original
Uncle Cattermole —good old Harwood—whose place
in the comedy it is very difficult to fill. No one ever
cattermoled like him in this country. Westma-
cott’s benefit was a respectable success on the
whole, and that manager departs out of the busi-
ness (for the present at least) with the good wishes
of everybody who knows him. He is remembered
as a man who put on some of the worst plays ever
seen in Sydney, and some that weren’t quite so
bad, and some that were even better, and who
kept the ghost walking honorably to the last.
The latter is a matter to be especially proud of.
The Australian managers whose ghost is always
reliable are getting to be very few now.

The Nile will rise at Her Majestyls for
positively the last time this (Saturday) evening,
and then there will be a week’s silence till
“ Prisoner of Zenda ” commences on the 17th.
The last night of “Matsa” is also the last stage
appearance of Miss Florence Young, who has put
on the gilded chains of matrimony and departs
for England with her husband to expose her ador-
able chest to the rigors of an inhospitable clime.
The Firm has resolved to fittingly express its
sorrow at the loss of this clever little lady at a
Saturday matinee, the programme consisting of
two acts of “Matsa” and one of “In Town.”
Fifteen acts wouldn’t have been too many to ex-
press what the public feel at Miss Young’s depar-
ture, but want of time makes it only possible to
give utterance to a small fraction of the general
woe.
** * *
The Palace having shared in the general
tendency to close up, Rickards’ company is now
concentrated at Sydney Tivoli. As the show this
week includes Edgar Granville ? Coleman, Alice
Leamar, Alma Grey, the Allisons, and those
especially clever artists, the three Delevines, it is
a more powerful combination than Rickards has
been represented by for some time, and, as the
city of the great slump will be actually down to
two theatres next week, it ought to coin money.
** * *
A new “ Silver King ” co., which proposes
to carry the softening and refining influences of
Dan’l Jaikes to the smaller towns, commences at
Newcastle on Easter Monday under the manage-
ment of Charles M‘Mahon, brother of the Mighty
Atom, and goes thence to Bendigo, Ballarat, and
other centres. It includes Scot Inglis as the King,
Inman, Sweeney, Misses Ida Hamilton and Maud
Appleton, and others. With this strong combina-
tion, Dan’l will be seen getting the shilling from
Bodgers in a more artistic fashion than he has yet
got it outside the capital cities.
#* # *
“Lelamine,” described as a French serio-
comic military opera, will get a whole week’s run
at Melb. Princess’s, commencing on May 8, unless
something happens to alter the present arrange-
ment. Alfred Moulton, who conducts the orches-
tra, is responsible for the music, and the libretto is
by Edouard Krusard, lately deceased in Jersey.
Less fortunate than Gov. Wobinson’s “Preda-
toros,” which had the assistance of Nellie Stewart
and the pick of the Firm’s forces, “ Lelamine ” is
to be played in the ominous name of Charity, by a
company of amateurs, and mostly sassiety ama-
teurs at that—Lord Shaftesbury, Col. Bingham,
C. S. Cunningham, F. E. Holroyd, and others.
His Lordship’s decent little voice has lost much of
its magnetism for the snobocracy by repeated
warblings on the concert platform, otherwise
“ Shaftesbury ” might have filled the house for at
least a couple of nights. Under the circumstances,
George Musgrove’s daughter, Rose, will probably
be the most interesting name on the bill, for it has
often been paragraphed in connection with per-
sonal attractions, and an unsatisfied ambition to
appear in public.
** * *
The half-crown musical entertainment at
Melb. Anglican Cathedral was not quite so im-
pressive as some of the free shows have been. An
orchestra and a number of female voices in the
choir brought a worldly feeling into the matter,
anyway. Also, the recently-published photo, of
murderer Phillips in a cassock and surplice has
weakened the seraphic effect of choir-boys. One
“ worshipper ” was observed to gaze earnestly at
the youngsters through opera-glasses, as though he
were looking for bloodstains on their hands.
** * *
“Mrs. Tanqueray,” at Melb. Bijou, last
week, must have disappointed everybody who
remembered the original B. and B. rendering of
Pinero’s great play. Mrs. Brough’s married Paula
is now a coarse, melodramatic person, artificial
alike in her explosions of wrath or attempts at
tenderness—an unlovable termagant suffering
from chronic dyspepsia. Possibly the audience
was to blame for the utter soullessness of Mrs.
Brough’s acting last Thursday night. A thick-
headed multitude in the amphitheatre treated
Paula’s tantrums as a joke, and laughed gleefully
on sundry occasions when she wrung her hands or
took the name of God in vain. A fine perform-
ance of such a play before such people as these
was not to be expected anyway, and furthermore
the leading lady had weaker support than of yore
from Cayley (Brough) and Ellean (Miss Hardy),
the step-daughter, in particular, being insuffi-
ciently cold and saintly. But O ! the difference
between this Mrs. Tanqueray, and the woman
whom Miss Olliffe depicted on her farewell night
at the Princess’s. Previously Miss Olliffe had
been less satisfactory than Mrs. Brough at many
points, but her one reappearance in the character
was an inspiration.
At Poverty Point,
A southern Guvment-’Ouse family, noted for economy
and kindred virtues, has just added another item to its
long list of “ thrifty ” deals. Vice-rovalty in that pro-
vince does not always do the local theatre on the nod, and
the other day the Governoress drove round to the box-
office to engage seats for the evening’s performance. The
usual tariff is two guineas every time the Governor’s box
is used, number of persons immaterial. As this was the
second occasion the show had been patronised by vice-
royalty, the management naturally expected Her Ex. to
hand in a cheque for four guineas. But she just asked
for five tickets and dumped down two sovereigns,
smilingly remarking that, as three persons had occupied
the box the other evening and five now made eight, at 5s
each, two pounds “will be exactly right, will it not?”
Of course, when the Firm’s polite voung man recovered
his breath he loyally replied in the affirmative.
What language are we amused in ? Some English words
picked from last week’s Sydney play-bills “ Nemesis,”
“Matsa,” “ Tivoli Matin6e,” ‘ Cinematographe,” “ Ront-
gen rays.”
The departure of Will Barnes for New York will give
this journal a few weeks’ rest from the drip, drip, drip of
laudatory paragraphs concerning that genius. Mr. Barnes,
who figures as chief costume-designer for the Firm, seems
to enlist the admiration of every penwoman in Australia,
and the combined female effort to make “Matsa” (for
which Barnes designed the ballet dresses) a means of
soaking Barnes into The Bulletin’s soul really deserves
credit for its pertinacity. It has been about the best sus-
tained effort in the history of unpublished contributions.
Haresfoot: “ I would like to see Titheradge as the
Vicar, Mrs. Brough as Olivia.” Why not do it at Mrs.
Brough’s farewell benefit?
One reason why Brough disbands is that Williamson
has Frohman’s co., in the same line, on the way from
America.
Melb. : “ The Alexandra seems to be gone for ever.
This week an auction has cleared out all the managerial
fittings, and left the place naught but a barn. The sym
posium affectionately fitted up by Dampier, since the
cave of Dan Barry and other monarchs, is as ugly as a
newspaper-office.”
Titheradge hangs pertinaciously to his cardinal error
as the abb(s in “ The Priest’s Secret.” He accents his
answer to the police-officer hunting Jean Torquenie, “I
give you my word no criminal is here,” in such a manner
that even the most dunder-headed “ cop ” could not fail
to detect the white lie in it.
Chirgwin is the most domesticated of music-hall stars,
and haunts St. Kilda sands or the park in company with
his family, a portion of which is usually contained in a
perambulator at which the white-hide Kaffir often takes a
hand. Chirgwin has modest tastes in everything barring
hats. By the way, isn’t the Kaffir’s “patter” just about
the worst ever heard, and the whistle with which he punc-
tuates it a gratuitous torture ? The man must be good
who survives the little prejudice created by such bald and
awful talk.
Alma Stanley, who accompanies Paulton to Australia,
was a professional beauty, rather than an actress, when
she first took to the stage.
Grey-headed Bellew and the galvanic Cora Potter
occupied the lower left stage-box at the Bijou on the first
night of the last revival of “Paula Tanqueray,” and at
each interval, when the lights had been turned high up,
the pair of beauties retired ostentatiously out of sight,
leaving their unconsequential companions to enjoy the
adoration of the gods. These removals suggested the
idea that Bellew and Cora had failed to induce Brough to
part a percentage of the takings, and consequently' de-
clined to officiate as a spectacular effect ’tween acts. Of
course they can quote distinguished precedents : the fat
girl, and the dwarf, and the living skeleton, from the
museums, are always careful to avoid the vulgar eye
when the said eye has not qualified at the pay-box.
Re, the general idea that Knowles is always the same
sort of breathless funny-man, a correspondent testifies to
the intense seriousness of Knowles, behind the scenes, at
the time when the Sydney Palace Theatre suspended
business. On that occasion he was every inch a Hamlet,
looking for the “ ghost.”
Scot Inglis and Harry Roberts lead the way for the
coming crowd of Australian young men actors.
It would gladden “ Matsa” Gulliver to hear some of the
juvenile remarks concerning him. A very small girl
amused those near her at a recent matinee by a running-
fire of exclamations: “Oh, there’s that dear little boy
again!” “Oh, mamma, I do love to watch that dear
little fellow. Isn’t he clever?”—and “Oh, isn’t he a
sweet little pet ? ”
Bernhardt hits Paris hard in Sardou’s “ Spiritisme.” A
husband imagines his wife dead. A medium brings her
ghost before him, but, of course, it is herself, and this
hollow-looking situation is managed with consummate
art.
Haresfoot : “ Williamson rises from the table in all but
disgust over the Melb. play season, and is inclined to
throw up the cards, as regards drama, with the success
of ‘Chinatown’ and ‘Matsa’ in his eye. ‘They want
variety,’ says he, and he is the potentate who can say by
Jingo they shall have it.”
Theorbo : “ Signor Cecchi’s shoes are languidly
struggled for in Melb. The teaching profession, voice and
piano, is at a low ebb, nothing comparable to the standard
of ten years ago. This is from the current genteel
poverty, which naturally affects first of all the purveyors
of luxury.”
The first Cinenratographe which ever struck Maoriland
was taken around there recently by Brother Joe M‘Mahon
on a six months’ tour, and did record business. All the
same a very much disgusted M'Mahon has now brought
the machine back, and is opening his show —a first-
rate one, by the way —in Bendigo on Easter Monday.
Maoriland is a pleasant enough place so far as the large
towns are concerned. In the small ones there are gene-
rally one or, at most, t o hotels, and as the Cold Tea
crowd has managed to make it pretty certain that no new
licenses will be granted, the monopolistic pub-keeper is
often haughty, and the girl who hands round the hash is
unbearable. Her general attitude is that “ that ’ere thing
on the plate is mutton, an’ if you asked for roast beef I
didn’t hear you, an’ if you don’t like the mutton you’d,
better go an’board somewhere else.” Then she guffaws
and goes away.
The new Theatre Royal, Perth (W.A.), opens with
“ Silver King,” for which several members of the dis-
banded Westmacott company have been engaged. Pre-
sently the Firm sends a comic opera co. along, so it is
probable that the six reigning families of the Westraliau
capital will have to take a chorus girl or two into their
little plutocratic circle ere the rainy season sets in.
Francie Adler, a grand-daughter of Madame Simonsem
who will take Flora Graupner’s part in “Matsa,” is no
taller than her petite predecessor. Australia would seem
to be producing a race of singing midgets. Even Gulliver
has a good voice for his inches.
Purves, Q.C., plays Sergeant Buzfuz without any ap-
parent sense of humor, but the performance he gave last
Friday was less seriously matter-of-fact than his first
attempt, which happened at Melb. Royal some years ago.
As the trial scene from “ Pickwick ” is likely to be an
annual feature of Dramatic-Fund benefits, Purves stands
a chance to grow into a low-comedian by degrees.
A recently imported actor supplies Melbourne with a
feast of color on fine afternoons. Bright brown coat and
pants, and fancy waistcoat to match ; light grey felt hat,
pink and white shirt, blue and white tie, and a bunch of
violets in his buttonhole. Harmonious.
Coleman is to play the part of the Irish spinster (vice
Mrs. Lauri) when “Matsa’’opens in Adelaide, at Easter.
This change in the cast will tend to strengthen the
family resemblance between “Matsa” and “Djin-Djin”
of yore.
When a sassiety lady takes to the stage there is no more
hope for the unprofessional johnnies who used to dance
attendance on her. Any gaudy mummer of the co., with
a mind to do a “ mash,” can be trusted to take the shine
out of them p.d.q., which, being interpreted, means
pretty dam quick. It has happened in a recent notable
case, where the ill-dissembled agony of the forsaken
cavalier should serve as a warning to all young men of the
bouquet-bestowing class. What’s the good in sendirm- a
floral tribute to your escaped goddess, if the prettiest
blossom in the bunch is fated to adorn the coat of a grease-
painted rival ?
One of the many Cine, shows has been taken on tour
among the gold and sugar fields of the North, and is
heralded by a glowing programme stating that the
machine is making its first appearance in Queensland
after delighting thousands in Sydney and Brisbane and
enjoying the patronage of “ H.R.H. the Governor of
N.S.W.”
According to a London paper, Blondin—who was 74 at
the time of his death—began his public career when only
four years of age. His real name was Francois de
Gravelet, and his father was one of the great Napoleon’s
most trusted soldiers.
Olga Nethersole, who got married in New York the
other day, will not be surfeited with domestic bliss, accord-
ing to all accounts. Her husband, Stewart Oliver is
Surgeon-Superintendent of the Indian Emigration De-
partment (whatever that may be), and bis professional
duties keep him in India for at least half the vear : the
other six months or so he will pass in the fair Olga’s com-
pany, if both parties are agreeable. The happy pair took
a homoeopathic dose of honeymoon to begin with, after
which the doctor rushed away to superintend emigration
in the East, whilst his bride bustled off to fulfil an engage-
ment in the West. Perhaps the gentleman suffered least
from this cruel separation. Judging from various
criticisms of Miss Nethersole as Carmen, her famous
clingsome kiss will give the recipient quite enough joy to
go on with.
Dear B.,—Your correspondent, “ 5.,” questions the fair-
ness of a writer who “cannot condemn” the hospital
nurse’s performance of Mrs. Maesmore Morris in “Two
Little Vagabonds,” but who “ frigidly discounts its merits
by assuming all to be due to arctic impudence.” Surely
the writer complained of paid the lady a fair compliment
in saying that, “up to a certain point, and under the
neoessarity calm conditions, there is no visible difference
between cold, natural ‘ cheek ’ and the art which conceals
art.” “ S.” asserts that Mrs. M. M. “ acts in a manner
that would not discredit an actress of talent and long ex-
perience.” That’s his opinion. I would rather maintain
that the fair novice isn’t called upon to act a little bit in
the professional sense of the term. Again, “S.” says,
“ As for the assertion that she will only do well * as long
as there is nothing particular to be done,’ it is easier to
win honor in one’s own country by acting than by pro-
phesying.” Which amounts to a prophecy by “ S.” that
the other writer’s prophecy will prove incorrect. Leave
time to decide the question.-
PATIENCE.
The Fiscal Ghost.
The inevitable fiscal question has turned up in the
Federal Convention. It is agreed that Customs
and Excise shall be the chief sources of Federal
revenue, and the amount to be raised by these
means will depend mostly on the amount of ex-
penditure to be provided for. The Protectionists
desire to make the Federal Government respon-
sible for a large proportion of the general expendi-
ture, which means that it must raise a large
revenue out of the Customs to make ends meet.
The Freetrade contingent, or rather a small part of
it—principally Premier Reid —desires to make the
Provincial Governments responsible for almost all
the expenditure, and to charge so very little to the
Federal Government that it must needs abolish
nearly all the duties, or else have a huge surplus.
As the Federal Government won’t, according to
present ideas, have charge of railway construction,
it can’t use its surplus in building new lines ; and
no provision is made for using it to reduce the
public debt, and the Federal Government can’t
legally drink the surplus, so it is reckoned it must
abolish nearly all the Customs duties to get rid of it.
If the Freetrade crowd sticks to this idea, a dead-
lock is absolutely certain, because N.S.W., by
reason of its huge land revenue, is the only
one of the older provinces which could keep out
of insolvency by the proposed method. Under
the system advocated by Reid and a few others
Victoria, for instance, would give up a little over
.£2,000,000 of customs and excise revenue, but
instead of being relieved of £2,000,000 of expendi-
ture it would be relieved of only about £1,000,000
or possibly less. Therefore, it would have to raise
an extra £1,000,000 by direct taxation to square
the provincial accounts. In Victoria there is
already a heavy income-tax, a limited State land-
tax, a heavy general land-tax levied for local
government purposes and heavy probate duties; so,
taking things all round, the raising of that extra
million looks a very awful problem indeed. New
South Wales would also probably have to raise an
extra million per annum by direct taxation
to squaife its provincial accounts, and by extend-
ing the local government system throughout the
province and thus making the local government
land - tax universal, it could provide probably
£600,000 of it in one act. N.S.W., having
£2,000,000 a year of land revenue against only
£400,000 in Vic. and £200,000 in S.A., has been
able to get on hitherto without a general land-
tax for local government purposes—over 99 per
cent, of the country pays no such tax ; and it has
this resource still to fall back upon, while Victoria
in particular has not. The Foreign-trade party’s
proposals would, therefore, make Federation in
the case of Victoria, and to some extent
in that of S. A. and Tasmania, equivalent
to provincial insolvency. The two parties
don’t talk about Freetrade and Protection, but
the one crowd wants to make the burdens of the
Federal Treasury so light that to all intents and
purposes it must abolish the duties on almost
everything, and the other crowd tries to make
them heavy partly to keep up the duties, and
partly because it is apparently the only way to
keep Vic., S.A. and Tasmania out of bank-
ruptcy. And Premier Reid’s advocacy of a policy
which will make union practically impos-
sible for two, if not three, of the provinces looks
like another attempt to wreck Federation on a
side issue.
A smart system of letter-indexing (inrto-
ducedby Mr Horace Grayson, of Mammatt’s electro-
plated goods agency) which was lately adopted in
the N.S.W. income-tax department, has now been
taken up by the slowgoing Vic. Titles Office.
Grayson’s ingenious index book is said to effect a
saving of 19| minutes in each hunt for particulars
of a land registration, as compared with previous
devices, therefore the clerks in the Titles Office
enjoy largely-increased opportunities for picking
their teeth.

The N.S.W. revenue for the first nine months
of the financial year (to 31st March) is £109,417 less than
for the corresponding period of last year. At the end of
December, however, the six months’ revenue was £228,074
behind that for the corresponding six months of ’95, so
things have improved greatly since then, and if the re-
venue keeps on increasing at the present rate it will fully
equal last year’s total. The deficit is the interesting
feature ; the nine months’ revenue is £6,717,394 ; expen-
diture, £7,135,724; deficit, £418,330. Under these cir-
cumstances it will take a lot of economy, and hard faking,
and postponement of liabilities till next year, or else a
wholly unexpected outbreak of prosperity, to produce a
surplus, or even to make ends meet.
During the nine months N.S.W. has spent
£1,074,755 of borrowed money, most of it on small, casual,
everyday jobs which yield no revenue whatever, or next
to none. The one tradition to which the N.S.W. Govern-
ment sticks with deadly earnestness is that it is neces-
sary to get from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000 further in debt
every year, and that the debt must always keep increas-
ing a trifle faster than the population. And in view of
this steady, pottering process of piling up liabilities, and
of charging posterity with the bill for wood-blocking
streets, and repairing old roofs, and replacing decayed
wharves, and for roads, bridges, statues, gunpowder
and cartridges and all manner of non-productive
and perishable sundries, Tub Bulletin respectfully
asks the Government of N.S.W., and several
other Governments, if they have any distinct idea
where they are going to? Also, it rises as a voice
crying in the wilderness to make the following sugges-
tions —for the billionth time or so : (1) That N.S.W.,
being by its own statistics and its own assertions the
richest country in the world, should pay its own way, and
stop borrowing from countries said to be much poorer
than itself, and be independent and self-reliant, and cease
to be a grovelling beggar at the door of the British
capitalist ; (2) that as its foreign loans fall due they
should be renewed locally—if they must be renewed ;
(3) that a sinking fund, however small, should be
started for the gradual extinction of the public debt.
Or if the country has got the borrowing complaint so
badly that it must borrow, this paper proposes the
following three innovations : (1) That all borrowing shall
be done locally ; (2) That borrowing shall only be per-
missible for works yielding a direct and constant revenue
—not for gaols, asylums, statues, museums, bridges,
roads, repairs to old structures, forest-thinning, scrub-
cutting, sarid-shifting, wood-blocking streets, and such
like rubbish ; (3) That the amount of debt per inhabitant
must decrease at the rate of (say) 2s. per annum—that is
to say, if the debt at the end of '97 is £5O 10s. per inhabi-
tant the amount borrowed during the next year must be
so proportioned to the increase of population that the
debt at the beginning of ’9B shall be only £5O Bs. At the
ordinary rate of increase this would still allow a very
respectable margin for loans, and it would at least be a
guarantee that the burden per inhabitant was growing
smaller instead of larger.

Comparing the situation of five provinces : The
N.S.W. revenue for the nine months just completed is, as
above-mentioned, £109,417 less than for the correspond-
ing nine months of previous year. The Vic. revenue is
£130,505 better than for nine months of previous year ;
S.A. revenue is £77,190 better ; Queensland revenue is
£1879 better. Westralia’s revenue for the last three
months is £276,927 more than for the corresponding
quarter of ’96, and the increase for the nine months is
something like £700,000. It is possible now that Westra-
lia, with not much more than one-third the population,
will show a bigger revenue for the year than Queensland.

The Vic. State Land Bank floated its second
loan of £20,000 at 3 per cent, with great difficulty. The
public subscribed £3200 only, and the Savings Bank put
up the other £16,800. The moral is that, when the
Savings Bank gets tired and won’t underwrite the loans
any longer, either the Land Bank will have to raise its
interest to 3J, or else it will have to make the loans a fix-
ture for at least 20 years—probably 30. At present the
Bank has the option of repayment at any time, and
people who take up 3 per cent, securities at par want to
know that their money is safely invested for a long period.
The fact that it can be handed back to them in a month
or two, and they may have to scout round for new in-
vestments, ruins the business. There is plenty of 3 per
cent, money to be got, but not on these precarious con-
ditions.

More alleged horrors concerning the Ward
Farmers’ Association (Maoriland) keep coining to light.
One strong point made in the preliminary inquiry was
that ex-Treasurer Ward had fixed matters in so foolishly
honest a way that profits made went to the Associa-
tion, while losses were often debited to Ward per-
sonally. The liquidator says that instead the Associa-
tion bore all its own losses, and some of Ward’s as well.
It is averred that during its brief and stormy career the
Association discounted 174 more or less bogus drafts
for £llB,OOO altogether, apparently to make its account
look right on balancing-day. In other words, if the Asso-
ciation owed the bank £25,000 it would, just before the
bank’s half-yearly balance, discount a draft upon John
Smith or somebody for £24,500, and the proceeds would
be put to its credit. Then the Colonial Bank officials
could tell their shareholders, if necessary, that Ward’s
busted show was only overdrawn £5OO, which was techni-
cally true; and a day or two later the useless draft would
be cancelled, and the overdraft would be £25,000 as be-
fore. Ward’s own huge debt to the Association seems to
have been faked the same way ; the idea was simply,
when balancing time came, to charge £50,000 or so of
Ward’s debt to anybody whose account could stand it,
and then, if any shareholder had asked how much Mr.
Ward owed the Association, it would have been a per-
fectly square thing for the chairman to say that Mr.
Ward’s account in the books was £l6 in credit, and that
the low-minded insinuator who asked the question was
doubtless a political opponent or a base impostor of some
kind.
Afterwards the debits and credits would be
shuffled round, and Ward would owe the same old
£50,000 once more. -The liquidators’ yarn is practically
to the effect that the Ward Farmers’ Association and its
pal, the Colonial Bank, were a long continuation of lies,
suppressions, evasions, underhand dodges, false balance-
sheets, Barabbas and gas-meter. After reporting about
40 different shady transactions of one kind and another
he remarks significantly that the Association started with
£lBB3 7s. 6d. available cash, and its first act was to issue
a cheque for £13,941 in payment for goods of various
kinds bought from Ward. Its second act, apparently,
was to lend Ward £3OOO with which to speculate in wool.
The capital was then £1245, so Ward seemingly had no
sooner started the Association, and sold his business and
stock to it at a good figure, than he borrowed all the
money it had and nearly all it could raise as well. And
he also, it would appear, kept on borrowing as long as the
miserable institution lasted, till it and he and the Colonial
Bank of Maoriland went down together.

The Bank of Victoria announces that it will
pay off another instalment of its reconstructed deposits
on 12th July. This will make about 60 per cent, of the
total amount set free.
* • * *
The London Bank of Australia’s reconstruction
scheme has been further modified in the House of Lords,
and it now reads that the minimum rate of interest pay-
able on the old deposits shall be reduced to 3 per cent.,
but that the depositors shall have a first lien on the profits
until they get their full 4J per cent. Under these circum-
stances there are only two courses open to the London :
to get ahead of the reconstructed depositors in the mean-
time oy writing off as much of the profits (over and above
the 3 per cent.) as possible to cover depreciation of securi-
ties—the securities can be written up again later on, but
it is advisable to consider them from a low-spirited and
pessimistic standpoint in the meantime ; and to pay off
the said depositors with all possible rapidity, as it is evi-
dent the shareholders will have no show worth mention-
ing until they are paid off. A very depressed manager
who could contrive to feel utterly hopeless about the
assets might save the London Bank £30,000 a year under
the latest new arrangement.

The Farmers’ Co-operative Fire and Marine In-
surance Co., of Canterbury (M.L.), shows a net premium
income of £4077 against £3376 for ’95, and a profit on in-
surance of £496 against £1406 in ’95. Interest on invest-
ments brings in £2981, so the year’s profit is £3477, and
the proportion of this which comes out of the actual in-
surance business is so small as hardly to be worth men-
tioning. A 5 per cent, dividend and 10 per cent, bonus
to policyholders absorb £3156. As the profits of the
insurance business are only £496, and the co. pays £714
bonus to policyholders, it would really be £2lB better off
this year if it had done no business at all but had simply
lain low and kept a hawk-like eye on its investments.

The Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York
finished 1896 in a blaze of glory. The year’s income was
£10,499,059, being £520,000 more than the figures for ’95,
and £2,778,321 was added to the assets, which now total
£48,202,083. The surplus of assets over liabilities is
£588,696 more than it was a year ago, and now stands at
£6,105,444 ; over 5)4 million pounds were paid to policy-
holders during the year, and the total insurance in force
amounts to nearly £189,000,000. These are the sort of
figures which are not run against every day, and people
begin to wonder where an institution of this kind will
stop. Suppose it goes on till all the earth belongs to the
Mutual Life of New York—what will happen afterwards ?

The Cheque Bank, Limited, shows a net profit
for 1896 of £6904, compared with £14,172 for 1895. A 6 per
cent dividend on ordinary and 7£ per cent, on preference
shares absorb £5759, and the balance raises the amount at
credit of profit and loss to £3583. The Cheque Bank is a
small British concern with £86,050 paid-up shares and
only £5OOO reserve fund. Out of its assets (£451,664),
£131,320 consists of a guarantee fund, which seems to be
simply unpaid capital: and £48,859 is “balance of pur-
chase of Cheque Banks of 1873 and 1876,” which also
doesn’t look like a realisable asset, and seems to be some-
thing in the nature of a goodwill that is undergoing a
very gradual process of writing off. Leaving out/these
two items, the visible assets of the bank are about
£271,000.

B.H. Junction purposes erecting a 3000-ton
concentrating plant—a wise move, remembering the dis-
proportionate extraction of shipping ore hitherto.
800 ft, developments in the South are again
disappointing, poor and hard faces showing. Latest
reported run for the mill for a week—l63s tons ore, for
531 tons concentrates, worth approximately 68 per cent,
lead, Boz. silver, and 8)4 per cent. zinc. North mill for
same period—s2o tons ore, returning 130 tons concen-
trates, assaying approximately 67 per cent, lead, 9oz.
silver, and 7 per cent. zinc.

Junction Norths were knocked out by the
announcement that there were smaller quantities of

After two months’ silence, it transpired at the
shareholders’ meeting that the last crushing of the Great
Western, Cobar, N.S. W., was only 2dwt. per ton, and the
excuse given for non-publication was that it was “so
poor” they were ashamed to let it be known. However,
it is now known that the pay-streak in the ore-body was
gutted out before the co.’s own plant was erected, that
the mine has been left in a dilapidated condition, and the
manager has his work cut out to find ore worth putting
through the mill. Altogether it is a fair average sample
of N.S.W. mining.
* » * *
Stated on good authority that the Cobar copper-
mine was worked last year at a profit of £97,000 ; also,
that £90,000, cash against scrip, was offered for the share-
interest of the tributors in the mine, which interest is
not quite one-half. Though the offer was subject to the
tribute running the full term, it was declined. Also
rumored that the tributors are so satisfied with the result
of smelting at Lithgow that they contemplate the erection
of much larger works, at a cost of £40,000, with the object
of dealing with most of the copper ores of the western
districts.

Rev. J. Campbell, at one time incumbent of

Melbourne Age : “It is very remarkable how
‘ distance lends enchantment to the view.’ No one would
proceed to Daylesford or Omeo on the strength of finds
equal to those in New Guinea, although there are here no
dangers of pestilence or ferocious natives. There has
not been even a single sensational discovery made in New
Guinea. At present there are four parties in the interior,
including about a dozen men on the Upper Mambare, ap-
parently at work chiefly on the M‘Laughlin Creek. They
were understood by latest reports to be getting but little
gold. No results had come from the other parties,
though they had been out for some time. Sir William
Macgregor says it will be a surprise to him if all of them
come back alive. It is only a sort of mania which w’ould
induce a rush to such a countrjq especially from Victoria,
where valuable deposits are discovered every day and will
continue to be discovered for many years by those who
intelligently and diligently seek them.”

There is a wild rush of “ mining experts ” for

Each auriferous centre in the province is running its own

most ingenuous style. In a circular addressed to other
councils it says : “ He (Mr. S.) has ability and aptitude
in giving forcible and pleasing expression to his opinions.”
A first-class mining drummer, in fact. Unfortunately,
persons of this~sort are no longer a novelty in London.
The inhabitants of that township have seen them before.

From a letter written by a London director after
a tour through Westralian goldfields “ The rubbish
that one has seen placed on the English market, arrd the
amount of English capital ruthlessly wasted to eni-ich a
few unprincipled promoters, is enough to disgust English
investors with West Australia. If responsible English
directors were to travel in the country wherein they have
interests, things would be done in a much more satis-
factory way. The truth is they will not take the trouble,
and are entirely led by the reports of men in whom they
repose misplaced trust. I was the first English director
seen in the backblocks, and of course heard a great deal.
Anything and everything is considered right in W.A."
whereby money can be made in the shortest possible time.
If English capitalists had subscribed some of the money
to assist in working the mines in the other provinces they
would have had much better return. . . . Good money,
and plenty of it, is often put into ‘ salt bush ’ flats, and
the genuinely good properties are ruined for want of
capital. In Bendigo and Ballarat the mines are run
by local men and by local capital. They never thought
of appealing to the mother country for assistance
to develop their mines, nor to English investors to send
them money and capital. The very machinery used is
made in the district, and so constructed as to be specially
adapted to that particular part of the country. In W.A.,
on the other hand, all the capital is English, and it made
my blood boil to hear the remarks about the idiocy of
‘ John Bull ’ to find so much money for useless work, and
expressions were made use of on every side of ‘ serve the
Englishmen right.’ . . . It is not the promoter, nor
the syndicate, nor the original prospector who suffers.
They all get their share, but it is the poor unfortunate
shareholder who suffers, and it is this dishonesty, so ap-
parent throughout the length and breadth of W.A.,
which is doing so much to ruin a country in which there
are undoubtedly some excellent properties. In Bendigo
4dwt. stone, which has to be hauled over 2000 ft., can be
put through at a profit. Compare this with W.A.,
where there are very few mines indeed which can be
worked very much under an ounce and make a profit.
People will tell you that 8 and 10 dwt. can be made to
pay in W.A., but it is very, very rarely true.” This sort
of thing is much too true to receive publication in the
Liars’ Country.
• * * *
From London to The Bulletin:—“You have
no idea how utterly demoralised the mining-market is
here. There is next to no business doing in shares, and I
am sure it would be easier to raise capital in Australia
than London just now. Most of the W.A. financial co’s
are hard-up for money, and find it impossible to realise
on their paper. Every settlement sees a depreciation of
an eighth to a quarter in most things. Some say there
will be a revival in the spring, though I do not count
much on it.”

What has become of the famous General Gordon
mine, supposed to be in Westralia? Silence too often
occurs when the battery is about to speak in all
languages. A meek attempt was made a few days ago to
revive the same old game —a director had been up to the
mine and was satisfied (we never hear anything else of
any director) the battery would start in a few days.
Allison Smith, the handsome and dignified ex-loco-
engineer of Vic., now consulting engineer of the G.G.,
said at a recent shivoo on the mine that the battery
would soon tell the tale. How does it come that, in the
face of all the puff, its shares are down to 65., or about £1
less than when the battery was a long way off ?

Richard Speight, the Victorian ex-Commis-
sioner of Vic. railways, has joined the lists of Wes-
tralian company-promoters. At present he is busy re a
big two-million tramway to be run from Newcastle, a
hamlet 60 or 70 miles from Perth, to the north of the
Menzies fields, running through the Mt. Ida and Mouline
country, if only Bull can be persuaded that there is any-
thing in it. Speight is consulting-engineer, and draws
screw at the rate of £lOOO a year. The business is only
in syndicate stage at present, and it is said the Forrests
have been roped in. One of the syndicate, with that
lively “scion of a noble race,” young Dilke, under his
wing, left for London some time ago. The idea Is to bring
ore to the water, and in this way it is just the opposite of
the Government’s theory of taking water to'the ore.
When both schemes get going there will be enough ore-
treating appliances in Westralia to cope with all the
ore raised in Australia and South Africa.

W.A. wire: “The manager of the Ivanhoe
mine has pegged out 70 acres in the vicinity of the co.’s
water-right, an action supposed to have been prompted
by developments not yet made public.” Pegged for the

managers, of a different stamp to Hewitson, under such
circs, pegged for themselves.

Most of the mining registrars and wardens on the
W.A. fields,although expressly prohibited from doingso, not
only accept, but lay themselves out for, “ insults” in the
way of paid-up interests in good shows. One well-known
bacchanalian Warden has been heard to declare in his
cups that, although he only gets somewhere about £4OO
per annum, he made close on £lOOO by “ diplomacy.” A
large proportion of officials in W.A., from the highest to
the lowest grade, are cashiered civil servants from the
east.

A mining engineer came to Westralia to supen-
intend the ereetion of plant. His careful examination of
pieces of ore prompted “What’s the caper?” from the
boss. “I believe,” said the engioeah, “there are two
kinds of reefs in W.A.—the male and the female —and I
want, if possible, to get at the sex of this one.” “ I think
you will find that nine out of ten are bucks,” replied the
boss.

Kauffman being out of the country, and the
glory and gorgeousness of George Gray being turned

of Westralia. He is now organising a £200,000 co. to
build smelting works at Fremantle, has secured some
copper and lead mines, and is building a fine pub. at
Albany a’nd lots of other things too trifling to name.
Brookman, landing at Albany a few weeks ago, was not
satisfied with the rooms available at the best hotel, so
walked down to the station, ordered a special train, and
left for Perth —cost, £l5O. At the same time Premier
Forrest, after expressing his willingness to take a shake-
down in the crowded hotel, shared for several nights
a small room with a N.S.W. practical miner, who
availed himself of the magnificent chance to curse Cat-
land.

Thus the Rialto (London), on W.A. finance
companies:—“Promotion being dead, the finance co.’s
have nothing to look forward to in the shape of profits
but the development of the mines they have floated. It
is within the mark to say that two-thirds of the W.A.
mines floated on the London market are absolutely worth-
less, and that the public have paid pounds instead of
pence for them ; also, that there has been more robbery
going on at the mines themselves than ever occurred even
in South Africa. Many of the mining managers would,
by their sayings and doings, put poor old Ananias to the
blush. The directors in Londhn have purchased proper-
ties on the report of a mining Ananias ; they have
remitted money for development work which may or may
not have been spent in that direction by Barabbas, their
manager ; they have wasted money in useless machinery
on the joint advice of Ananias and Barabbas ; and when
their bank-account became dry, they discovered at the
same time that the property they purchased, and on
which they have spent so much money, is not worth—
vulgarly speaking— 1 twopenn’orth-o’-gin.’ There are, of
course, exceptions, but you can count them on your
fingers. This year, which we have been looking forward
to with so much hope, and in which we were all going to
make our fortunes, will be, as far as W.A. is concerned,
nothing more nor less than a year of liquidations. We
must not shut our eyes to it. It is as sure to come as
indigestion follows pork chops.” The pork-chop boom !

According to Q. mining wardens the gross local
product in ’96 was 638,2120 z. The actual exports pan
out like this:—
Gold in bars and dust, 626,9300 z. ... £2,114,257
Gold ore, 66 tons ... ... ... 1,078
Gold slag, 2 tons ... ... ... 350
£2,115,685
The valuation per ounce is under £3 10s. The Queensland
output ought, therefore, to be reduced one-eighth, before
a proper comparison can be made with, say, Vic. gold-
yield. But even the Vic. gold-yield is not authoritatively
valued by anyone. In olden days, the valuation used to
average well over £4 —but it has lately been reduced by
the low quality of much of the Gippsland gold.

The characteristic Australian opinion about
that record reign is expressed in the report of
proceedings of Mount Morgan Town Council—
A letter was read from Secretary, Associated bocal
Authorities Association, to the effect that the association
intended to signify their loyalty and attachment to the
throne and person by presenting an address to the Queen
on the occasion of her having reigned 60 years, and asking
the Council to join in. The cost would be about lCs. 6d.,
but not more than £1 Is. Aid. Whitehead thought it
was cheap at the price, and Mount Morgan ought to keep
up with the times. Seconded by Aid. Flint, and sup-
ported by Aid. Matthews, who said he was a loyal subject,
and carried.
Exactly. We are loyal subjects at “about 10s. 6d.;
but not more than £1 Is.”—by Emu !

One morning last week Melb. Argus burst
forth with large-typed announcements that the
local jubilee memorial would take the form of a
fever hospital, and that Lady Brassey was appeal-
ing for subscriptions, and that the Mayor held
“strong views ”on the subject. For the next 24
AT THE SALE YARDS.
“Look here, old man, that cow you sold me was no good; she won’t give any milk. ”
DEALER: “ When did you try to milk her?”
“ Last Sunday; she kicked me in the ribs besides.”
DEALER: “No wonder she didn’t give any milk; didn’t I tell you when you bought her not
to milk her on the Sabbath? Why, the cow was a blessed Ranter! ”
hours the Argusian hysteria remained unaccount-
able. People not “in the know ” were asking one
another why this unexciting charitable scheme —
which had been put forward by baronet Clarke’s
wife, long before Lady Brassey smiled upon it, or
the Mayor’s “ views ” were advertised—should be
suddenly magnified into a gigantic event. Then
came the explanation. The proprietors of the
Argus had decided to give 1000 guineas to the
new hospital fund.
In the contest of munificence between Mel-
bourne’s rival newspaper-proprietors, David Syme
may consider himself beaten. He devotes ,£2OOO
to the encouragement of military sport by sending
a team of volunteer shooters to England. The
undemocratic nature of David’s gift is emphasised
by the fact that squatters Pursy Chirnside and
Staughtqn are likewise providing large and ex-
pensive picnics for men-in-buckram. The oracle
of Liberalism and the two hard-shell Tories figure
as three souls with but a single'thought, three
hearts that beat as one. But the Argus manage-
ment presents itself as a practical pal to the
working-classes by handsomely aiding the endow-
ment of a norspital.

Gov, Buxton’s pretty and English-looking
daughter appears to take a .lively interest in
Federation. She has attended the Convention
sittings with her father every time the old gentle-
man has been there, and, notebook on knee, has
jotted down gems of eloquence from the lips of
the talking men. Waxcellency Madden’s plump
and pretty daughters also spent a couple of days
at the Convention while in Adelaide on their way
’Ome.

Governor Brassey leaves not a detail of
Govt. House management to anybody but him-
self. The mere domestic details of the place are
superintended by H.E., and scarcely anything at
all is left to the management of his spouse. The
old man is as great an authority as to the amount
of suet that goes to a boiled pudding as concern-
ing the armament of battle-ships, and he knows
as much of soups and sausages as of statistics and
blue-books.

A Sydney palmist shows a letter alleged to
be in the handwriting of the lady-Governor of an
Australian province, complimenting the anaemic
vein-reader on the accuracy of her diagnosis and
assuring her that her revelations have been “help-
ful to me in the highest degree.” “Helpful”—
that is somehow a very English-fashionable word.

Two warrants for the arrest of Assistant-
Paymaster Craddock, of H.M.S. Katoomba, were
issued—one of them for desertion. For years past
the British navy has declined to follow deserters.
The motto is, that the man who “ jumps ship ” is
not worth keeping. Before that any policeman or
civilian who captured a deserter received =£l,
known as “blood money.” If Craddock’s only
offence had been desertion his name would simply
have been taken off the roll. What, then, was the
use of warrant No. 2 ?
* * * *
The policeman’s idea of the fitness of
things (Sydney daily paper paragraph last week):
Any person having lost an English lever watch with an
open face, and bearing the number 166888, is requested to
call on Constable or Constable , at No. 1 Police
Station, for the purpose of identifying the watch, for the
alleged theft of which a young man is at present in
custody.
Evidently the polioe have no evidence that the
young man in question stole the watch, and no
one informed them that such a watch was missing.
Therefore, the young man is apparently arrested
on the ground that he looks like the sort of young
man who might steal a watch, and the watch is
detained because it looks like the sort of watch
that would naturally be stolen by that sort of
man. Then the watch is offered as a reward to
the person who will assist the force in getting that
young man comfortably gaoled for the winter.

Costs of court, unless incurred in some
criminal action, should bet treated as an ordinary
debt. Justice A. H. Simpson declined last week
to interfere with an “ attached ” man detained in
Darlinghurst Gaol since January last. Parlia-
ment should leave as little as possible to judicial
discretion.

Nothing shows the still-provineial character
of the N.S.W. community better than the extra-

The latest “weather” disturbance : —the
Wragge-Russell correspondence.
What does a
policeman accom-
plish by collecting
names of persons
liable to summons?
AtN.S. W. National
Park, on a recent
holiday, scores of
men and boys defied
the bye - laws and
the presence of wo-
men (many of whom
watched the pro-
ceedings with inter-
est) by swimming
while absolutely
nude. Apark-ranger
and a hot policeman
spent two hours in
pulling stealthily
about the river and
chasing shir tie ss
youths through the
bush. At night the
constable was heard
lamenting hysteric-
ally that he had
taken 135 names in
all, and probably
every one of them
was fictitious.

A Melb. Argus report of an attempted
murder case suppressed the fact that the victim, on
being taken to the hospital, was first treated by a
lady-doctor. The conservative organ hates lady-
doctors. They are intolerable to the sentiment of
50 years ago.

The part of Sydney metropolitan news-
paper rivalry which cuts the old-established
Herald most keenly is that people will persist in
sending their letters to both morning papers;
and sometimes—O sacrilege !—the Telegraph
gets them first. Then Editor Curnow grinds his
teeth. The Herald notifies that it will not
guarantee insertion of letters sent to another
paper ; but it has to insert them—or go without.
. . . . . .
A more than likely result of the Federa-
tion movement : the advent in Sydney of a
National-Protectionist morning paper under the
aegis of David Syme, whose unique experience and
enormous resources will enable him to command
success. t „

At the Glebe (Sydney) court, the other
day, said a square-jawed man whose wife had
summoned him for maintenance : “ She sent to
England for me two years ago, and she said (here
his voice grew tremulous) she would make a good
home for me.” He was ordered to pay 4s. a week

Policemen aver
that the most salu-
tary treatment for
a drunk is to lock
him up on Saturday
night and over Sun-
day. The captive
awakes on Sabbath

appalling thirst, but
his necessary pick-
me -up doesn’t ar-
rive. The spiritless
creature who faces
the bench next day

In the Isis Scrub (Q.) there appeared the
other day an old man propelling a heavily-laden
barrow containing picks, shovels, dish, tent—in
fact, a whole miners’ kit. The hardy veteran had
wheeled the whole from Clermont goldfield—47o
miles—and had been three months on the journey.
There’s grit in this land yet—among the old men,
anyway.

WILCANNIA, Tuesday.—A wotran who was lost on the
Seventy-mile Track turned up at the Twenty-six-mile
Tank on Saturday in a very exhausted condition, having'
been three days without food or water. The woman
whose name is Anderson, is 70 years of age, and was
travelling with a swag in search of work. She started to
walk from Hay to Wilcannia, and the endurance and
pluck shown by her are remarkable considering her age.

In the new-invention dress he wore there were
iron rings to resist the pressure of the water,
which, at the depth he went to, would be about
five atmospheres. In previous trials he had found
that the rings in the sleeves greatly hampered his
arm-action, and ere going down on his final trip
he removed the arm rings, despite the warnings of
a well-known Sydney doctor of science (who hiin-
se“ has tramped the harbor bottom often), who
carefully explained that to descend in the altered
dress would mean asphyxia by drowning. Madsen
went down; the immense pressure stopped circu-
lation m the arms the upper-parts of the sleeves
were driven in through the shoulder-rings, thus
producing a five-atmosphere compression of the
« hes b ar ‘ d respiration and circulation were vio-
lently stopped. The man was drowned. The
doctor was offered a big fee to attend the expen-
ment, but declined. Ihe Bulletin prints this
[ or what it is worth. Medical evidence at the
inquest alleged that Madsen was not drowned,

for, in the matter of love, Propinquity is the one

In Albury (N.S.W.) district, a tramp has
been travelling under the burden of two swags
weighing unitedly somewhere about 1801 b. The
weight was a bit too much for him, but he got
over the difficulty by humping one swag along for
about 100yds., planking it down, and returning
for the other. In this way he progressed at the
rate of nine miles or so a day. That man was

Editor Bulletin, —When a poor woman,

has to institute divorce proceedings “ on the nod,”
is it necessary and humane to publish the fact (as

crime ! Instead of the farce of assigning counsel
and solicitor (presumably paid by the cheap advt.)
to the poor petitioner, the Judge could easily him-
self bring out the simple facts—marriage and mis-
conduct-provable in ordinary undefended cases by
the marriage certificate and the woman herself.—

One Arrowsmith writes to Melbourne Age
advising its readers to succour poverty in their
midst, “ instead of sending their money to help a
lot of Kaffirs, who would think nothing of scalping
you if you came in their way.” Mr. Arrowsmith

Fund is being got up to assist distressed Apaches
or Sioux, and that Apaches and Kaffirs are the
same thing. His ideas are mixed, but his senti-
ments are not altogether unsatisfactory.

A W.A. policeman (in plain clothes) was
taking a lunatic by rail to the Perth Asylum, and
had absent-mindedly placed the “ admittance

While the bobby was looking out of the window
the lunatic quickly picked up and pocketed the
documents. At the asylum door the officer felt
for the papers—they were gone. The lunatic im-
mediately produced them, and, handing them to
the warder, said: “His chief trouble is that he
thinks he is a policeman, otherwise he is very
quiet.” The bobby was forced inside, protesting
all the time that he was the policeman. Ulti-
mately the pair changed places. But that Robert

fell the cattle rushed from all directions and tried
to seize it, and the swaggie would have to drop
down and beat them off with fire-sticks. So the
duel kept up for some time—victory ultimately
lying with the man. Just think of the condition

When the hide was taken off the disease was on the

which was also very bad about the kidneys, and when an

never has said that Australian society is not good
enough for the cream of English clergy, but is not

... R. : In English law (writes an authority) no action
will lie for a libel on a corpse, the main reason being that
there can be no proper plaintiff. At Common Law, how-
ever, it is a misdemeanor to write and publish libellous
words concerning a dead man, provided that it be alleged
and proved that the words were published with the intent
of bringing the family and relations of the deceased into
hatred and contempt. As early as 1734 a criminal infor-
mation was granted against a person for libelling one Sir
C. Nicoll, then dead ; there it was alleged that the
libel was published with intent to vilify the memory of
Sir C., and to stir up hatred against his family and pos-
terity. Later, an indictment alleging a libel on Earl
Cowper with intent to disgrace his family and character
was held bad after a verdict of guilty, and judgment was
arrested because no intent to create ill-feeling or to
throw scandal on his faf .ily was alleged. It will thus be
seen that the criminal remedy, which is the earlier,
is also the more extensive one, and that a libel
may be indictable though not actionable D.8.C.:

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
A/r r , Sydney, April 6,1897.
My Dear Myee—
Eight hundred blue tickets are now scattered
around the Nicest of the city, admitting them to
the Cathedral for the wedding of Hon. Margaret
Brand and the opulent Capt. Ferguson, on 21st
April. Much fluttering anxiety was caused
among the invited by the words “full dress ” on
u 6 °P ri ) er the white end. Some women
thought it referred to ladies’ costumes and decreed
a display of floured collar-bones and arms to the
searching sunlight; so, to settle the point, a tall
politician was formed by his female friends into a
deputation to an over-worked aide among whose
duties it is to settle little matters of that sort,
and brought back official information that “ full
dress ” meant that any guest having any kind of
uniform must furbish up same for the ceremony.
Whereat the long legislator was much pleased, as
now he can arrange to beautify the show by wear-
ing his National Guard duds inside the sacred
edifice.
The circulars issued some time ago to 300 likely
persons among the toney, inviting subscriptions
for a present for the forthcoming Govt. House
wedding, were responded to by a gathering last
week. Subscribers appeared, but “ not—not the
300.” It was decided to give the bride a silver
toilet ornament. The girls’ gift was undertaken
byasassiety damsel at the head of a clique at
variance with other cliques, and so coin has not
been flowing freely in for the object. The
numerous dearest friends and bosom enemies of
the promoters of joint-ptock wedding-gifts would
rather each hand in her own modest little butter-
dish or photo.-frame with donor’s card attached
than help unadvertised to buy a gigantic glittering
tea-and-coffee service with other unnamed “ ladies
of Sydney.”
An above-the-average attendance graced Rose-
hill racecourse on Saturday afternoon. The trains
ran to time, and the sec. ’s gallant endeavor to
popularise his meetings with lady race-goers was
rewarded by the presence of some smart sporting
girls who generally turn every gee-gee con-
test around Sydney. As for dressing, it is a lost
art just now, with all one’s summer things worn
out and shop windows untemptingly displaying
furs and velvets in this steaming weather. At
last week’s outdoor gatherings the woman with
the longest-lived muslin was the queen of the
situation. Two or three cloth “tailor-mades”
and tweed gowns, ante-dated winter, seemed to
smother their wearers.
As the record April fool—ror his folly was made
known to the world on April Ist—the arrested
naval assistant-paymaster really must take first
prize. To endeavour to pull off such a double
event as he did was wondrous. Marriage under a
false name and getting away safely, and for
good, to Melbourne with his bride from a place
where every fifth or sixth person in the street
must have known him by sight, was more than
enough for one man to undertake. But he is
alleged to have got away with ,£2400 of ship’s
gold, and under such circumstances to take up
quarters at a leading city hotel argues that this
enterprising young man of 24 has more valor than
discretion. It is said that he had taken passage
for himself and bride in six different steamers, in
none of which has the lady now any chance of
wearing her ,£2OO worth of new frocks packed in
eight trunks.
The lass that loved sailor in this astounding
case loved him unbeknownst. It wasn’t the sup-
posedly irresistible blue-and-brass that did the
business. The fascinations of the sea-going per-
son must be mope than uniform-deep. Another
alleged naval love-affair has been lately interesting
Melb. sassiety-par. writers, who affiance a Sydney
“ naval officer ” to a young woman journalist and
solemnly lecture her in social columns on the mis-
take of plunging into matrimony, on the strength
of a sky-rocketty announcement which surprised
nobody more than the alleged fiancee herself.
A deadlock occurred recently between New-
castle Municipal Council and Govt. House in con-
sequence of the aldermen’s refusal to give His Ex.
an official welcome to their town after it had been
arranged that he was to open a local Benevolent
Asylum, not situated in the city itself but in an
exclusive suburb. The trouble has, I hear, a
woman at the bottom of it. She is a metropolitan
philanthropist who engineers the charity. Hav-
ing obtained Gov. Hampden’s promise" through
the Chief Sec. that he would launch it on its new
career, she moved the asylum authorities to point
out to the aldermen,that it was their duty to give
the vice-regal procession a public welcome, but the
aldermen intimated that as neither the Chief Sec.
nor the lady philanthropist were citizens it was
beyond their jurisdiction to invite the Governor
to the town at all. Then His Ex. heard of the
fuss and promptly cancelled the engagement. A
meeting of citizens was held afterwards and a cor-
dial invitation given to the Governor to come
along casually at any time and bring the “ Gover-
ness ” with him.
An orange-blossom scented atmosphere is ex-
pected to be wafted about between Easter and the
beginning of May, so there will be a week or two
after Lent wherein loving couples may be united
before the unlucky month throws its blight on
superstitious wooers. So enterprising drapers are
making ready for the boom in weddings by adorn-
ing their windows with filmy veils—chiffon, not
net, is the latest material for the bride to blush
under and other vanities. In one of the windows,
by the way, is shown a pair of plush curtains, so
brilliant that they made me wink, worked by the
nuns in one of the convents with flannel-flowers,
waratahs, and other indigenous vegetables, also
emus, parrots, and assorted natives, striped with
polychrome lace, all most exquisitely done, and to
be raffled A. M.D.G. and the good of the Church
at the big fair beyant St. Mary’s Cathedral.
There has been a dearth of dressy drama lately
until the adyent of “ Sweet Lavender,” which
gives sartorial scope. Terry, of the tiny mouth,
takes full advantage of it; his frock-coat is a
poem, and ho w (space is the latest thing for em-
phasis, according to the Red Page) does he get
his hat so glossy ? The Gilfillians, mother and
daughter, should give a tone to their scenes.
Minnie (Miss Seabrooke) does so in three pretty
frocks, all of local build ; No. 1 is yellow silk with
cloudy blue chiffon on the bodice and big black
hat of the “ Hamlet’s Aunt ” style ; No. 2 is a
blue brocade of girlish evening cut; No. 3 a pink,
daisy-patterned silk with green elaborations.
Bessie Rignold makes Lavvy’s red hair match the
crimson window-curtains, and gets a Jan Van
Beers effect by wearing a pink dress against her
glaring wig. On the second night the intervals
were filled in by the dress-circle, principally in
trying to establish the identity of a pretty stranger
in a stage-box. It was an elderly men’s evening
out, the d.c. positively glistened with bald-heads.
The late German consul Sahl, was at one time
very wealthy and connected with the important
German S. tea-trading firm which is a political
power in Samoa. He did not come forward in
any social way'until after his marriage, and, until
he joined the German Club, he was not well-
known personally even by his fellow-countrymen
in Sydney. He travelled much in Australia and
the South Seas before settling here, where he
lived for the last 27 years. For consular services
Mr. Sahl was given two German decorations ; at
his death he was president of the German Club.
Many gilded personages fancy that they are
made to pay too dearly for their whistle. One
Melb. millionairess, on that account, never buys
her gloves and other small goods herself, but ob-
tains them per her less-known sister, and so saves
a supposed sixpenny overcharge. An Australian
Governor’s wife lately ordered a smart vehicle
built to her order at rather a fancy price. A few
days after it had been sent home a plainly-dressed
young woman called at the builder’s and asked
what he would charge to build her a cart exactly
like the new vice-regal one. He had but one
price and named it. The girl then rejoined her
mistress, who was waiting around the corner, and
proved satisfactorily that the latter hadn’t been
“ got at.”
“In Sydney, 5000 people assemble to listen to a
pianist like Miss Leverrier and strew roses in her
path, while in this wretchedly Puritan-ridden
place (Melb.) the audience generally yawns while
the critics adjourn for a drink, and only return for
a little more sleep preparatory to writing some
commonplace stuff for the next day about a thing
they know nothing of.” Thus H. J. King
harangued the Melb. Liedertafel, of which he- is
conductor. He omitted to state that the 5000
assembled by invitation, and roses are cheap.
Gratuitous indiscriminate applause is the best pos-
sible thing for spoiling a young performer’s future
career. Unless Yvonne has a phenomenally old
head on her young shoulders, her ordinary hats
will become too small for her, and she will have to
wear “coon” headgear. On her first appearance
in Melb., at a Marshall Hall concert, there was an
outburst of disapproval in next day’s criticisms.
Most impartial musicians thought that there must
be something in a girl who could win abuse on such
a lavish scale. And there is much ; Yvonne could
never be insignificant, but her faults are on the
same large scale as her powers.
A Mildura concert was to be enlivened by a
male quartette, but the tenor at the last moment
developed a bad cold and a substitute was hunted
up—-a fat, little pomposity who had only hazy
notions of what he had to do. On the platform he
suddenly developed stage fright for which he had
prepared himself beforehand in vain, and he
quietly and abruptly walked off. The other three
were absorbed in the music, until the second tenor
glanced around with a horrified stare at the blank
space, and he. also went, leaving the two basses
roaring away unconscious of their loss. One of
the basses—a shy, bashful youth—suddenly dis-
covered that the audience was shrieking with
laughter, and then he departed swiftly. The last
man, with a defiant glance, nobly stuck to his post
in a solo to immense applause.
The dressiest woman amongst the delegates’
wives in Adelaide is Mrs. Neil Lewis, the Tas-
manian Opposition leader’s wife. She is a viva-
cious, thin little lady who seems to know every-
body and to wear in turns samples of all sorts and
styles of dress. Many delegates who did not take
their wives with them telegraphed for the ladies
subsequently—probably to keep themselves (or the
wives) out of other temptation.
A country parson has been trying to get his
congregation to mortify the flesh during pre-
Easter days. But they are rebellious, and don’t
mortify anything except the poor unheeded shep-
herd. The godless youths and maidens of his
flock have formed a tennis-club, and have tea-
parties there when games are going on. During
Lent the clerical veto has gone forth against
these guileless teetotal sprees, and players must
swing their rackets with thirst unslaked by the
washy beverage usually spilled about so freely at
a tennis-club meeting.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“ The matrimonial affairs of a well-known pair,
who had their miseries crowned (in dental par-
lance) in the divorce-court some time ago, have
taken a most uncommon turn. The divorced wife
duly put her neck in the nuptial noose again; her
first partner had been a comfortable country profes-
sional man ; her present one is a respected man of
letters. Since the lady’s second marriage the
divorc4 has developed a strong platonic affection
for his lost property. After making several ad-
vances of a reconciliatory nature, he forwarded a
substantial gift to the newly-married pair at
Christmas—with his blessing. Amicable relations
exist between husband Past and Present, and the
lonely divorce has asked the happy pair up to his
country mansion to eat the Easter goose with him.
“The announcement, ‘Ladies only, admission
free ,’ drew a big audience of the fair sex to Melb.
Athenaeum, where Dr. Emily Ryder lectured on
‘How not to be ill.’ If any bold, bad man had
succeeded in eluding the girl door-keepers, he
would have found the proceedings disappointingly
mild. The doctor is a brainy-looking, white-
haired woman who lectures in her University cap
and gown, and speaks well, despite her national
twang. She made some trenchant remarks re the
enormous fatality among Australian infants, and
wished there was as much study given to child-
raising as to sheep-ditto. She maintained that
‘ the present custom of marrying a boy and girl,
and shutting them up in a house to breed human
beings haphazard, is simply iniquitous ’! At
which plain statement the young women applauded
vigorously, and the old ones gasped in horror.
According to Ryder, girls now-a-days demand
something more than r mere masculinity ’—anv
girl can get married in a week, if she will take
the specimens that offer themselves. ‘The lack
of marriages is owing to the feminine standard
being too high. ’ In the next breath, she gave men
unstinted praise for their all-round common sense,
and declared that no man ever wore his belt so
tight that he couldn’t eat his meals in comfort.’
Also, ‘bad home-cooking drives men to drink.’
“ The Princess matinee was an entertainment of
the usual scrappy order ; the audience was chiefly
a horde of vast-hatted women. The ladies of the
profession mingled with the newly-joined members
of their ranks and sold programmes, tea, and
sweets, with smiles of inscrutable sweetness, to
d.c. and box patrons. Mrs. Morris, who looked
very charming in black silk with a Paisley silk
blouse and picturesque hat with roses, took her
place in the Pickwick trial scene and chatted with
the expansive and still - spreading Cosgrove.
Miss Sutton, in blue muslin and comic-opera
hat, sold programmes in the front of the house.
By ‘A White Stocking’ the fascinating Ferris
shows that he figures more successfully as a
playwright than as an actor. The scene in the
library of Laughton Rectory is very fetching, with
the firelight shining on the snow-covered boots of
the rector, and the pink-and-white brocade and
brown curls of Miss Page; and Mr. Knight’s
military dress of scarlet and gold makes a fine
touch of color against a deep brown wainscot.
The little play is merely a set of Randolph Calde-
cott’s pictures dramatised and picturesquely
staged. In the ‘ Trial ’ scene, Charlie Brown, as
crier, spoke with much irreverence to some of the
witnesses. He alluded to Norman Menzies —
cleverly made-up as a red Elphberg—as ‘ a pur-
veyor of intoxicants,’ and called Kyrle Bellew
‘ the Apollo Belvedere ’ with such flippancy that
the admired one refused to appear.
“At the Broughs’ ‘at home’ at the Bijou on
Thursday afternoon, a representative assortment
of people was brought together. The smart set,
with whom the co. has always been immensely
popular, turned up to a woman, and ‘ the pro-
fession ’ trod the boards on which the reception
took place, and shook hands with host and hostess
with a lofty, upward shake, as self-consciously as
though ‘ the front ’ was full of onlookers. The
singing of Katherine Hardy was one of the most
attractive turns during the afternoon. Never has
the silvery-throated mezzo sung so well, and all
present regretted that this uncommonly fine song-
stress does not use her vocal talent more in her pro-
fession. Regarding her acting there has always
been a, division of opinion, but as to her singing
there is absolutely none.
“ The set of choice spirits which rules the world
of ‘ sassiety ’ in this city is gradually becom-
ing so limited that it can hardly people two
smart entertainments at one time. A fashion-
able garden - party suffered much in point of
numbers on Friday last by reason of the Princess
matinee, and, although the house was thronged,
the garden, wherein a capital band discoursed
festive strains all the afternoon, was entirely
deserted. Nearly everyone present was talking
of spending this season in London and making
arrangements to meet each other ‘ln Town.’
The poor residue of the smart set which will be
left behind looks forward to a very dismal and
serious-minded winter. Last winter was flat
enough owing to the scarcity of young and eligible
men, but this year the girls have taken wing, too,
so that the halls of fashion will be left desolate
indeed.
“Mrs. Potter has been much in evidence in
very public places during the past week, and with
her elf-like locks—a tint or so more emphatically
gamboge—weird trailing clothes and marvellous
hats, she has served as a highly-colored advt. for
her forthcoming season at the Princess’. In the
face of columns of wailing against the eternal
theatre hat in the evening papers, Cora sported a
vast black tea-tray, with a hecatomb of wildly-
nodding plumes, at the Royal the other evening.
The patient-looking Kyrle, who sat with her,
was quite obscured by the structure from any
point of view, and looked like a headless body
in too-closely-fitting striped grey pants. .Just here
one might enquire if Kyrle was ever seen in a
well-shaped pair of continuations of fashionable
loose cut ; his nether garments are usually of the
kind which go with high heels and an abbreviated
coat. The attenuated Cora is wearing her hair a-
hanging down her back, gathered in with a black
ribbon at the nape of the neck, a style which
makes her look more than ever like an un-recent
photograph of Mrs. Scot Inglis.
“ A recent Bulletin paragraph, reminding Gov.
Brassey of a certain cheque for ten guineas long
promised to a new Presbyterian kirk in Ascot
Yale (Melb.), evidently caught the Brass-eye.
The cheque was forthcoming last week, and has
been thankfully acknowledged. One or two other
charitable objects are now looking for a decent
opportunity to jog his Excellency’s memory.”
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Despite the cry of “hard times,” the approach-
ing' meeting of the A. J.C. promises to be one of the most
successful ever held at Randwick. With True Blue
Delaware, Newhaven, Coil, The Officer, Cremorne, Charge’
Aurum, The Hypnotist, Hopscotch, Vivian, and Battalion
all in more or less good trim there should be some high-
class racing.
* * * *
Newhaven has arrived at Randwick, and at
exercise moves in his best form. Most of the w.f.a. events
should be easily secured by him, though if he meets
Aurum in the All-Aged Stakes the flying Trenton colt
may stop his winning career. The punting public won't
be sorry to see his downfall, as the Sydney Cup scratching
was a miserable fiasco.
» * * •
The time-honored Hawkesbury Racing Club
holds its annual autumn meeting to-day (Saturday), and
as there is a “sweep” on the big handicap, some good
racing.may be expected. In the Clarendon Stakes, Mun-
diva, Jack Horner, and First Mate seem to have good
winning chances, whilst for the Autumn Handicap, Kal-
latina, Helmsman, Pense h Moi, and Miss Nora look like
supplying the winner. . .
V * * *
Mr. W. Kelso with his lengthy string is pro-
viding much speculation as to his ultimate representa-
tives in Doncaster and Sydney Cup. At present Reka for
the former and Tom for the latter race are both great
public fancies, but when the barrier goes up it will likely
be found that Crfinie d Or will be the elect for Doncaster
and Reka for Cup. The latter, running Resolute at 21b.,
was only three-quarters of a length behind Mr. Wilson’s
colt in Melb. Cup, and now they meet at 91b., which, con-
sidering Reka is very well, gives him, on paper, an un-
doubtedly good show.
* * * •
At Rosehill, N.S.W., last Saturday, the Q.
horse Battalion put up a good performance by carrying
9st. 121 b. into second place in the. Autumn Handicap. As
this wonderfully-consistent performer is very well at pre-
' sent he may be expected to carry Bst. P2lb. into a pro-
minent position in Sydney Cup.
* * * *
The Fleet Admiral division evidently doesn’t
fear the all-victorious Aurum, as it last week booked the
big bet of 800 to 100 about its pet. Should both these
cracks survive the difficulties of training their meeting as
three-years-old will be something well worth seeing.
♦ * * *
The sensational gelding Hopscotch was given a
gallop in Rosehill Handicap, and for over a mile he led
the field a merry dance with 9st. 121 b. up. He now reigns
as second favorite for Doncaster Handicap—but he is well-
in for the more valuable Sydney Cup.
• « * •
The owner of Daimio writes out that jumpers
like his horse lose too much at the English jumps, clear-
ing sft., whilst the Britishers are skimming along a foot
lower. He thinks a really good bold hurdler would win
many English steeplechases.
* » » *
St. Lawrence, late Miss Curtis, won the trot
last Friday at Brighton, Sydney, hut much latitude was
allowed by the judges over her bad breaks. A break is
allowable so long as the horse does not make ground over
it, but when a horse makes several bad breaks galloping
fifty, perhaps a hundred, yards each time, as St. Lawrence
did on Friday, disqualification should ensue. In 1892
Miss Curtis’ record stood at 5.34, which she cut down on
Friday to 5.26.
* * * *
At the Feb. meet of Tattersall’s race-club,
Elphin, Tas., Mr. Quong Lang’s brown mare, K.L., won
the open trot, trained and ridden by the Chow himself.
About half-a-dozen of his countrymen follow the races
regularly, and one or the other is almost invariably seen
at the tote window for div.
* * * •
A Maoriland St. Leger Stakes, 500 so vs., is
billed for 1899, besides three other classic races by the
Wellington R.C. The tote !
* * * *
The Ballarat gelding, Blackwood, who V"!
whispered to have a chance for the Australian Cup (until
they scratched him), won a race at Flemington on Satur-
day in rather handsome style. The son of Vengeance-
named after the owner of that sturdy battler—was seem-
ingly underrated by old Wilson, for he went out at 12 to 1.
* ♦ ♦ *
There can be no question as to the advantage
which a two-year-old enjoys in w.f.a. races towards the
end of the season. Aurum’s recent smothering of Coil
and The Officer doesn’t look at all remarkable in the light
of Key’s performance at Flemington last Saturday. The
unfashionably-bred youngster gave 71b. to Pilatus, 241 b.
to the three-year-old Campaign, and 31b. to sprinter
Bacchus, and beat them from end to end of a six-furlong
go.
* * * *
Of 15 starters in the Hill Handicap, at Y.R.C.
April meeting, five were shut off from all chance of
winning by the bad management of the starting-machine,
for which Godfrey took the blame. Another instance of
the necessity for giving the starter power to call back the
horses that get away in cases where the machine is re-
sponsible for leaving some of them at the post. Or has
the starter a discretionary power, and, if so, why doesn’t
he exercise it ?

Turner, the bowler, leaves Sydney in a few days
to make his permanent home in Brisbane.
* * * *
East Sydney paid Paddington back in its own
coin on Saturday. Paddington closed its innings at
two wickets for 269 runs—Alec. Bannerman, not out, 133
evidently thinking it had a good thing on ; but East
Sydney finished out the day with 204 for the loss of one
wicket—C. A. Richardson, not out, 40, W. J. Camphin 95,
and J. Gould, not out, 65.
* * * *
The Forget-me-nots, lady-cricketers, of Warr-
naiubool, played a local team of fat old men the other
day. The male eleven did not contain a man under 50 or
less than 15st. The girls won. Grace before meat.

“ Musgrove advises that the prospects of the
Aus. baseball-tour in America are bad.” Yes —not one of
the Australians eats cigars or hits the ball into the next
county or says “Great Snakes!” Australians probably
won’t do as baseballers in Yankeeland.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —The conditions of the races
were so dissimilar that Percy Cavill’s beating of English
champion Tyers’ half-mile amateur swimming time goes
for nought. The men swam in salt and fresh water re-
spectively, and no man can say what difference that, and
the kick-off at the end of each lap in Fanner's Baths,
would make. That Cavill should have beaten Tvers’ time
by 34 2-ssee. certainly looks like too much of a good
thing, under equal conditions ; but perhaps the perform-
ance is discounted most by the fact that Repan finished,
within ten yards of Cavill. Had Cavill distanced his
field the performance would have looked better on paper,
for it is scarcely likely we have suddenly dropped across a
whole batch of swimmers able to beat the Britisher by
upwards of half a minute.

Michael Chapman, of Hereford-street, Forest
Lodge) says:—

known. It has, after a few applications,
cured me most- effectivdyr-STrd—b hiiw iTftd”'
no trouble for the past eighteen months. I
can recommend it to all-”

Apropos the Sargood portrait affair, it
would appear that any shoddy person can have
his portrait hung in the Vic. National Gallery,
which contains no pictures of the really notable
men who have had a place in Victorian affairs.
Higinbotham is not there, for instance. The idea
of carving Sargood’s effigy in marble was aban-
doned, because the Age intimated that David
Syme would not allow it to be put up in his
Melbourne.
Ricciotti Garibaldi, son of the Liberator,
who offers to go to the assistance of Greece with
100,000 Italians, was formerly a truant-inspector
in Vic. Education Department—which was the
best the authorities of the day were able to do for
him. As private secretary to James Service he
proved a round peg in a square hole. Ricciotti’s
present offer is probably mostly talk. His brother,
Menotti, was the fighting man of the family.
Edmund Barton—M.A. at 21, barrister at
22, Speaker of N.S.W. Assembly at 33. He is
now a trifle over 48.
The British statesman who predicted that
Gladstone would die insane was a seer. At pre-
sent the G.O.M. is riding a bike.
. Canon Kemmis, lately deceased, frequently
had his morning-paper ironed (to take the damp
out of it) before he would read it.
The Adelaide papers are strong in the
history- of interprovincial politics. The Freetrade
journal introduced Barton as Parkes’s Attorney-
General in ’9l.
As the result of an accident, Robert Mac-
quarie, aged 87 years, a nephew of the old-time
N.S.W. Governor of that name, died at Gawler,
S.A., last week.
Melb. city police force contains constables
Felsenthal, Mafferzoli and Mercovitch. And yet
“ St. Patrick’s Day passed off with a marked
absence of disorder.”
Softgoods Sargood : “I have no time to
cultivate those arts commonly called popularity.”
This from a shopman ! Presumably the cultiva-
tion of such a cheek employs the whole of a man’s
time.
Turner has not yet had courage to scrape
the plain “George Turner’’ off the gate of his
St. Kilda home. Displayed humility in a man
who takes a title is ridiculous excess. He is suffi-
ciently humiliated.
Butler’s latest cabled exploits —-attempted
suicide, by trying to open his temporal artery with
his thumb-nail, and an admission that he did kill
Preston, but in self-defence—by shooting him in
the back of the head.
George Dean, of North Sydney poisoning
fame, is taking his incarceration very badly. He
is said to be bordering on lunacy, and reports con-
cerning his condition are now before the officers of
the Prisons Department.
Speaker Coles and Siredwin Smith, of
S.A., both cleared for Tasmania just before
the Federal delegates arrived in Adelaide, the
popular idea being that they desired to escape the
expense of entertaining them.
Westralia was the ninth British dependency
presided over by the musical William Robinson.
This is the record in governing. They quote :
“ The greatest Governor who was ever a musician,
and the greatest musician who was ever a
Governor.”
Melb. : “ Our laureate is Purnell. He
collocates coppers by poems on what is going.
Of course, the Phillips’ petitions are accompanied
by a long ‘ pome ’ from his hand. Sample :
Just think of the parents, whose nerves are unstrung,
Lest this their darling boy should be hung.”

The direct cause of Yic. Minister Peacock’s
most violent outburst of demoniac laughter at the
Convention was a hen-story narrated by a Tas.
delegate : This individual’s hens were always root-
ing up the garden, and to stop this he procured
some bantams and brahmas, with the result that a
race of hybrids was produced. If one of those
hybrids stood on the brahma leg, it simply
scratched the air with the other, and if it stood on
the bantam leg and tried to lift up the earth ; at
the first stroke it would be shot over the fence into
the next-door neighbor’s garden. Hence Peacock’s
yells.
James Andrew Massingliam, of Mittagong
(N.S.W.), invented a new wpe d-gear for bicycles.
He was for a while elated with his success, but,
on a friend explaining to him a radical defect in
the gear, the elation gave way to despondency, and
last week he blew his brains out.
N’.S.W. Judge Gibson, who gave a man
three years (which carries nine months' solitary
confinement!) for stealing a ninepenny tin of
baking-powder, was formerly associate to Mount
Rennie Windeyer. Three months’ hard-labor and
one month’s solitary for each penny !
No more rumors of dailv and weekly news-
papers to be started in Melbourne by “ Mr.
Bailey, from India.”, The other day poor Bailey,
from India (he was editor of Calcutta States-
man), died in Melbourne Hospital. He had fallen
from his horse and fractured his skull.
Hori Grey will be- 85 on April 14, and
Way, P.C., will complete his 61st year during the
same week. Grey ceased to be Governor of S.A.
in 1845, and Way did not make his first appearance
there until ’53, the year in which Grey left Maori-
land to assume the governorship of the Cape.
The ornamental Lyttleton H. Bayley, who
was N.S.W. Attorney-General in ’59, is now a
Judge of the High Court, Bombay. Meeting a
Sydney acquaintance not long ago, he attributed
his hale and hearty existence to having quitted
Australian politics before he began to like them.
Vic. Chief Justice Midden, to Barrister
Duffy (who wanted a half-hour adjournment for
the purpose of stowing away food and liquor) : “ I
breakfasted at 7, had no lunch, and don’t expect
to be able to have dinner before 8 o’clock. ” The
fat man again. Surplus is strength. Fat is force.
Mr. “ Hee Hem” Smith, ousted from
M.L. Parliament last election, has applied to New
Plymouth borough council to increase his screw as
town lamplighter. There is no false pride about
Smith.- His son carried on the Ciz. while he was
in the ’Ouse, and now he has resumed his sunset
walks again.
Convention pressmen award the palm for
“wind” to Holder and Glynn, both S.A. dele-
gates. The former, the long, gaunt S. A. Treasurer,
goes along at a terrific pace, though with a clear
voice ; but lawyer and literary man Glynn has a
two-foot brogue which makes the smartest scribe’s
hair stand on end.
The “father” of the Australian Bar is
still alive in England—Alexander Gordon, Q.C.,
equity barrister, who practised for many years in
Sydney, and who was “called” as far back as
1841. The next on the list is retired N.S. Wales
D.C. Judge Dowling, who dates from 1843 ; then
another retired N.S. Wales D.C. Judge, M‘Far-
land, whose date is 1848 ; and then Justice M. H.
Stephen, still in harness, who was “ called ” in
1850.
W. V. Ralston, who succeeds Drury as
general-manager of Q.N. Bank, was the Western
pioneer of that institution from the day it started.
He vegetated for years in a little wooden caravan-
serai in the pastoral village of Tambo, where all
things were as sluggish as the sleepy Barcoo
River. He afterwards passed to the coast, where
he added soldiering to finance. When Ralston
was appointed acting-manager he signified in his
first report, about a year ago, that no dividends
should be paid to shareholders. Now that he is
manager in full he boldly denounces dividend-
paying in the circumstances as robbery.
Major W. T. Reay, editor of Melbourne
Herald, member of the Council of the Anti-
Sweating League, Grand Something or other in
the Oddfellows, candidate for Parliament, A.N. A.
worker, &c., &c., goes ’Ome as one of the officers
in command of the Vic. Mounted Rifle detach-
ment. His special missions are to show Wolselcy
how to command the army, Chamberlain how to
conduct ltis colonial policy, and Andrew Lang
how to write English - together with any other
work that comes handy.

The Mulhalls, father and son, who found
the body of Burgess and helped to carry it 60 miles
into Parkes, have not succeeded in obtaining any
pecuniary reward from N.S.W. Govt. The Govt,
offered £5O for the discovery of the body of Lesah,
believed to have been murdered, and it was while
in search of Lesah that the Mulhalls found the
clay of the assassinated Burgess. But the genius
of red-tape remarks “ Government had offered no
reward for the recovery of Burgess.”
It might be as well to point out to the
great jubilating British public that the 60th year
of Her Majesty’s reign is also the 350th anniversary
of the demise of Henry the Eighth—and, after all,
there is probably more sense in rejoicing over the
death of the latter monarch than over the prolong-
ing of a weariful senile decay in the former poten-
tate.
R. H. Horne (writes “Tom Collins ” to
The Bulletin) was never warden of the Blue
Mountain (Trentham, Vic.) goldfields; he was
mining registrar there, not only for two years,
but during nearly the whole of the sixties. The
contemporary warden’s name was Heron. Horne
was a genial, courteous, forgetful, comprehen-
sively incapable official; a man radically unfit for
any office demanding the smallest exercise of dis-
cretionary power. Nevertheless, he was extremely
popular with the diggers who constituted his
clientele ; and Heron stood to him like a dashing,
unscrupulous young father to a foolish old son.
By the way, do you know anyone who can lay
his hand on his heart and say he has read “Orion”
or “ Prometheus ” ?

POLITICAL
POINTS
C’est le Premier’s faux-pas qui coute.
The Westralian delegates could not even
get to tbe opening of the Federal Convention in
time. W.A. —“ Wait Awhile.”
Reid is the only Ministerial head who is
going to England as a “Prime Minister.” The
others are content with the ordinary title of
“ Premier.”
Carruthers is entitled to the N.S.W. Act-
ing-Premiership in the event of Reid roving ; but
his cabal with Wise to re-enthrone Parkes is re-
membered against him.
The wonder is that a political career was
possible to a man with a laugh like Peacock’s.
The fact that he is intellectually superior to his
laugh does not account for it. The '.writer knows
a cleverer young man who found public career
impossible because of a cast in his eye.
ODDS ARE EVEN.

A Bulle-
tin corres-
pondent :
The experi-
ence of the
Con vention
electionsin the
suppression of
“plumping”
should lead to
an improve-
ment in our
representative
system. There
is not the least
doubt that in
a sparsely-pop-
ulated country
single elector-
ates do not
work well.
Without being
a laud ator
temporis acti,
anyone can see
that the N.S.
Wales Parlia-
ments elected
in 94 and ’95
were no im-
provement on
their predeces-
sors, which is
saying very lit-
tle. The con-
sequence is
thatpeople rail
against the
one-man - one-
vote principle,
when the fault
les with the
parochial cha-
racter of the
constituencies.
The Conven-
tion election
showed that it
was not one-
man- one-vote
which brought
about Barton’s
defeat for
Randwick i n
’94 at the hands
of a pigmy like
Storey. When
Dilke’s Reform
Bill of ’B4 was
being prepared
the English
party manag-
ers studied the
merits of
grouped and
single elector-
ates correspon-
ding to the
French contro-
versy of scru-
tin de liste v.
sc/ atin d' ar-
rondissement.
They favored
single seats be-
cause, through
“ plumping, "a
representative
group could
not be elected
in what were
known as three-cornered constituencies. Now the Con-
vention results show how plumping can be dealt with.
Therefore, it would be advisable to group the present
N.S.W. constituencies, which could be done in a short
and simple Act of Parliament.
David Syme’s big donation towards send-
ing a Vic. military show to England has brought
other bloated capitalists to the front. Chirnside,
M.L.A., dumps down £2lOO to pay the expenses
of an Easter military encampment, and Staughton
offers a big cheque to send four more riflemen to
England. Apparently there is any amount of
money available for gas and guns and gaiters, but
if Turner sent round the hat for some plain, useful
purpose —say to make a practicable road through
an inaccessible portion of Gippsland—it would
probably come back not only empty but kicked
mto such a fearsome shape by somebody’s boot
that the owner would shudder when he saw it
again.
S.M. Herald on the unemployed trouble :
“ When Mr. Garrard returns from Maoriland
fresh ground will probably be broken.” Pre-
sumably, Hon. Jake means to bury his dead.
Fed. Convention delegate Dobson (Tas.)
says that if Leg. Councils were to trust the people,
the people would kick them out. Certainly. They
might always trust the people to do that much for
them—with enthusiasm.
Premier Kingston can hardly, like Turner,
stipulate that if he goes to England the Opposi-
tion will agree not to table a no-confidence motion.
John Downer, now of the Opposition, returned
from the Imperial Conference some years ago to
find that his Ministry had been kicked out in his
absence. Kingston was one of the enemy on that
occasion.
Glynn proved the fastest speaker in the
Federation debate on Barton’s resolutions. After
him Holder, Deakin, O’Connor, and Zeal. Simon
Fraser was the most halting; Isaacs’ speech
showed the best arrangement and was the most
epigrammatic; Gordon’s the most flowery and
flippant; Trenwith’s the most serious ; Forrest’s
and Lyne’s the jerkiest.
Premier Nelson (Q.) : “I hold that no
single man is necessary for the welfare of any
country or state, and it is with this feeling I am
going to England.” Quite right.
No one man is stem, or stern, or truck or kelson
Of any ship of state
Whatsoever :
And, as far as Queensland is concerned, “ Sir” Nelson
From “ Home” may come back late
Or, say, never.
R. F. Toucher, the new president of
A.N.A. (Vic.), is a clerk in the Income Tax
office. For some years past he has been the
Federation League of the province, with an in-
veterate habit of calling himself together in numer-
ous corners of the country, and then adjourning
after moving himself a hearty vote of thanks.
Toucher’s election was the result of a re-action
against pushing M.P.’s, who seemed inclined to
run the whole show.
Hogan, M.P., announces that, it the Aus-
tralian Commonwealth gets fairly afloat and
Queensland still hangs out, he will move, when
the Constitution Bill is passing through the British
House of Commons, the addition of a clause per-
mitting Central and North Queensland to join the
Federation “on their own.” Hogan’s chances of
success amount to very little, but the attempt
would at least make Brisbane politicians sit up
and curse beautifully.
Who says that women do not take an in-
terest in politics? At Wellington (M.L.) the
other day four lady voters were fined 10s. each for
tearing out each other’s hair in the street as the
result of a debate on the present licensing law.
The two who upheld Prohibition tore out most
hair, though as one of the Prohibition ladies had
the worst-wrecked nose of the four things were
about even. The Maoriland she-voter takes an
interest in politics right enough.
Without Government or Opposition in the
Federal Convention the speeches in the general
debate simply bristled with compliments and
flattery. No speech was referred to, even to be
attacked, unless it were able, or thoughtful, or
skilful, or unless the speaker had laid the Conven-
tion under an obligation or something of that sort.
Barton in replying did venture to hit a little
harder ;so did Trenwith just before him. But
these were the bright’exceptions.
J. P. Abbott’s
nomination of
Kingston for the
Presidency of the
Convention, and
his frank assur-
ance that the post
by precedent and
right belonged to
the local Premier,
hit G. H. Reid,
who had been in-
dustriously bar-
racking for
Joseph, in a pecu-
liarly tender part.
Yet the hit was
quite in the Ab-
bott manner. The
writer recalls a
night in N.S.W.
Parliament, be-
fore the closure
days, when the
Opposition, of
whom Abbott was
one of the stirring
leaders, deter-
mined to obstruct
the Govt, by all
means in its
power. Walker,
O’Sullivan, and
other long-winded
bores were put up
to talk through
the night. Ab-
bott had gone
home at 11 p.m.,
but promised to
be back early in
the morning, and
the effort of the
talkers was to keep a House for Joseph. At
8 a.m. Abbott arrived. Melville was on the floor,
a ghastly picture of an idealess man from whom
words dropped. All the bores crowded in to re-
ceive the congratulations of the spick and span,
well-refreshed leader. “Do you mean to say,”
began Abbott, pointing a finger at the Chair,
“ that you’ve been going on this way all night ?
It’s a disgrace to Parliament and to the Chair.
Why didn’t you shut these bores up ? Why didn’t
you turn them out ? Let the Government have
their vote. I’ll be no party to this senseless, silly,
obstructive lunacy.” Whereat the bores who had
been all night saying “ Wait till Abbott comes,”
melted disconsolately away.
THE ONLY ONE.
STRANGER (to old hand on the river—at pub.): “Did you know one Ryan on the
Darling?”
O. H.: “Scores on ’em.”
STRANGER: " Paddy Ryan?”
O.H.: “Dozens on ’em.”
STRANGER: " Quiet chap — didn’t drink?”
O.H. (long think): “He must have died years ago!"
“ My definition of Protection is feeding a
dog with his tail.” Dobson at the Convention.
Dobson did not attempt to define Freetrade, but
as it appears in Australia, it is a policy of the dog
lending his tail to feed another fellow.
G. H. Reid waited until all the big
speeches on Barton’s federal resolutions had been
delivered before chipping in. Then he carefully
picked his way, steered a safe middle course,
generally usurped the functions of the leader, and
thus took the wind out of Barton’s sails.
THE X RAYS.
N.S.W. Commissioner Eddy is decidedly
in favor of Federal railway management, and
Mathieson, of Vic., and Pendleton, of S.A., are
reputedly of the same mind. If these three ex-
perts hold that Federal management is not only
feasible but advisable, it knocks most of the stuffing
out of the provincial argument.
Kingston undoubtedly made a bad mistake
in taking the chairmanship of the Convention. A
chairman is really a man who keeps order —a
superior kind of chucker-out, and, in the absence
of anybody to chuck, Kingston is merely a mute
on a cushion, without even a chance to make pos-
terity remember that he was there at all.
Graham
Berry’s experi-
ence in the
chair has sadly
silenced him.
He is one of
the statues,
always in his
place at the
Convention,
never inter-
jecting. Dea*
kin, Barton,
Cockbn rn,
Wise, Gordon,
and O’Connor
are the inter-
jectors in
chief.

In the Hawkesbury district a gang of 15
sleeper-getters gave as a reason for not voting at
the Federal election—“ That they could not find
out who was for Protection or Freetrade.” To
the average bushee an election means Protection
or Freetrade, Protection implying more roads,
Freetrade more bridges. Protection subscribed to
the local cricket-club; Freetrade opened the
flower-show; also the tariff is mixed 'up with
births, deaths and marriages, long beers and seed-
potatoes. We want none of this new-fangled
Federation here. Give us the old tariff cries and
we knows where we are.
Reported that a vote of £5OO is to be pro-
posed to cover Premier Reid’s travelling expenses
to England. If so, then the curses which Reid
heaped on Dibbs’s for his ex.’s to
England will come home to roost in real earnest.
By the way, it now appears that the £lOOO drawn
from N.S.W. Treasury to pay Dibbs’s touring ex-
penses was refunded to the State by a faithful
and enthusiastic Ministerial colleague of the Pre-
mier’s, out of his own pocket, on the understand-
ing that certain other persons would share the
expense with him ; but, up to now, the Minister
in question has only been reimbursed about half
the amount.
The Federal Convention is now racing its
business through in red-hot haste, so that it may
get finished in time to let the Premiers go away to
London and crawl. If the committees had leisure
to consider the hard knots of the case at length,
and dine and sleep over them, they might find a
way out of the worst difficulties. But for want of
time they go in for long sittings, and grow tired
and acrimonious, and when they come across a
very hard difficulty, like the railway problem, the
decision is : “ We haven’t time ; let’s throw it up.”
. The biggest question in Australia’s history is
being rushed through as if it were a Windeyer
trial and a Windeyer hanging, merely that the
boss patriots may get away to dab their heads
against the floor m front of a royal fetish. The
irony of it!

Zeal, Syme’s nominee in the Fed. Con-
vention “ Plural voting has always worked
equitably m Victoria. I see no reason why it
should not be adopted by the Convention.”
Last Friday the judicial committee of the
Convention arrived at a notable decision. There
is to be a Federal Court of Appeal, and except on
imitters of State the appeal to the Privy Council
will be abolished. The weird tomfoolery of send-
ing an Australian Judge to England to hear Aus-
tralian cases, and sending the plaintiff and the
defendant and the ca,se there after him, instead of
letting him decide it on the spot, is to be wiped
out, and to all appearance S. A. Chief Justice Way
may as well throw up his new billet.
All the infuriated loyalists of Australia
are rising to protest against the Convention pro-
posal to call this country the Commonwealth of
Australia. ‘Dominion ” is the title that the loyal
crowd specially, hankers after. The Bulletin likes
the term Commonwealth as having a more demo-
cratic sound, but still a name is only a name, after
all. If the road-and-bridge politicians can bring
about an equitable arrangement for consolidating
the railways and the public debts, this paper will
as a fair equivalent, be willing to call Australia a
Dominion ” for the rest of its life. And if they
will get over the trouble about the Federal capital
and stop borrowing, and create a really prosperous
sinking fund, and start a comprehensive irrigation
system, it would almost be willing to let them call
this country Hogsflesh if it would make them feel
any better. No British prince could surely want
to come out here and be Governor-General of
Hogsflesh.
The committees appointed by the Federal
Convention. suggest that the members were
shaken up in a bag and dropped out promiscu-
ously. The committee which draws up the Con-
stitution contains most of the strong men, such as
Barton, Carruthers, O’Connor, Baker, Cockburn,
Gordon, Deakin, Isaacs, and Trenwith. The
other strong men are mostly put on the committee
which is to arrange the judicial system. The
financial question, which is the great stumbling-
block and the biggest mystery of the lot, is handed
over mostly to the dull nonentities. Walker,
of N.S.W., who knows finance and probably
nothing else, is on the judicial committee, while
the mildly incapable Brunker is on the financial
one. Out of the fifteen financial men only four—
M'Millan, Holder, Fysh, and Graham Berry—are
even suspected of knowing anything about the
subject. The judicial question is a matter which
specially demands gravity and seriousness, there-
fore Peacock and his awful guffaw are on it to be
in keeping with the natural unfitness of things.
The naval authorities are completely non-
plussed at t.ic conduct of the alleged defaulter,
Assistant-Paymaster Craddock, who absconded
from Sydney with, as it would appear, <£2400 of
his ship’s cash, as he had a splendid record. He
was a teetotaller, and apparently had no extra-
vagant habits. He had also been a prominent
figure in religious circles, and during his three
years on the Sydney station frequently joined in
religions services at the Y.M.C.A.* and also
lectured at the hall of that body upon temperance.


British Enterprise in
Australia .
The surprising expansion of British trade
during this century, of which we are
reading so much in connection with the
forthcoming celebration of the Queen’s
long and eventful reign, is, of course, to
be attributed to the intrepidity and
enterprise of British colonisation, which
has expanded the roots of one people to
the four quarters of the globe. But this
is not by any means the only circumstance
which has conduced to the present
supremacy of British trade. The Norse-
man of olden time spread his white wings
to the Baltic breeze and both explored
and exploited his neighbors far and near,
but with no lasting success. The heroism
which prompts nations to brave the
unknown is generally regarded as magni-
ficent, but seldom leads to any permanent
commercial success. To this, however,
British colonisation offers a striking
THE SALE ROOM.
exception. Naval heroism and intrepid
exploration have been supported by
trade-organisation of the most solid
character, and British
commerce has been
pushed out continu-
ously in perpetual
accord with the trade
developments at
home always ad-
vancing always
s preading—always
ambitious to touch
heights which are not
even in view in the
immediate present.
A case in point is
afforded by an impor-
tant enterprise now
flourishing in Melb.
Shepherd and Co.
Limited, is a mercan-
tile company estab-
lished in London a
year ago for the pur-
pose of carrying on
business in Melb.
as a direct distri-
buting agency for
British and Conti-
nental firms. The
founders of the com-
pany are Messrs. T.
A, Shepherd & Co.,
of 79 Mark Lane,
London, who have a
high reputation as
export merchants in
many classes of mer-
chandise, but speci-
ally in wines and
spirits. The com-
pany’s share-list in
eludes some of the
leading shippers, ana amongst the agen-
cies held by the company there are firms
of world-wide celebrity. John Robert-
son & Son, Limited,
of Dundee, send their
famous “J.R.D.”
whiskies, of various
ages, from 5 to 15
years ; George G.
Sandeman, Sons and
Co., of London,
Oporto, and J erez,
their marvellous
ports and sherries ;
G. H. Mumm and
Co., of Reims, their
magni ti cent cham-
pagne (which was the
premier wine at the
last Lord Mayor’s
banquet in London);
A. C. Meukow and
Co., of Cognac, their
fine old brandies ;
Lamb & Son, of Lon-
don, their rare old
Jamaica rum ; and
Vickers and Co.
(distillers to Her Majesty), their excel-
lent dry gin. Cigars of choice quality
are shipped from Havana, Manila, India
and Germany. Another important agency
worked by the Company is that of
Higgin’s Patent Dairy Salt, which

societies 1 Besides the business done in
duty-paid goods at the stores in Manches-
ter Lane, a very considerable quantity
of liquors is sold in bond to large buyers.
Especially is this the case with what
may be styled the “Federal ” spirit
of which it is known that, when-
ever the roll of the British drum
is heard, Robertson’s whisky is
drunk and appreciated. In India and
China, in Burmah and Ceylon, in the
clubs and of Malta, in the saloons
of wicked Port Said, in South Africa,
through and in Australia from Carpen-
taria to Hobson’s Bay, from Cape Howe
to “The Leuwin,” the J.R.D. brand is
“ a familiar spirit ” on counters, by
the social fireside, in the settler’s hut,
and in the mining camp tent. It seems
to suit all climes and classes, and to be
universally accepted as a reliable type of
the best whisky produced in Scotland.
* * * *
In Melbourne, testimony to its excellence
is furnished by an admirer in verse
“ A hint to the old and a word to the young
On the popular subject of drinking :
Beware of new liquor that blisters the tongue

The election of secretary for the N.S.W. League
of Wheelmen has resolved itself into a very bitter fight
between the Sydney morning dailies. The Herald’s can-
didate is Fred Hawley, former secretary, and the D.T.
runs secretary Hunter for all the game is worth. So warm
have things become that libel and slander actions are
freely hinted at. Those who know the prevailing cool-
ness between some of the parties cannot help wondering
that the columns of so-called impartial papers are per-
mitted to be their battleground.
The League secretaryship contest is based to
some extent upon the tropical opposition by secretary
Hunter to various schemes brought forward by other
members. On the other hand candidate Hawley’s solitary
denunciation of another wheelman is famous. “ You
know,” he remarked indignantly, “ I think you’re such a
silly little silly.”
* * * *
Ever since a Melb. paper buttered Berry by
alleging that he rode like Zimmerman, that promising
young man has been letting his hair grow to accentuate
the supposed resemblance, until he now looks like a
skye-terrier, or a chrysanthemum, or something to that
effect.
•'* * *
When plain Bill Martin was donkey-licked by
Eelph in his heat for the recent mile championship at
Melb. Exhibition, Yankee Willie let up at the last moment,
and was greeted with cries of “Cocktail!” by an un-
reasonable populace. Willie could get no pace, the other
competitors resisting all the wiles he employed to induce
them to take precedence, until the last lap, when he was
abolished 50yds. from home, and sat back in wrath. The
boo-hoos of the crowd lashed the gentle William to fury,
and he gibbered at them, and showed his teeth, and
finally performed a gesture of contempt not considered
permissible even in the best society. Billiam, naturally
prone to anger, was probably never so anxious for mischief
before, and there was something almost pathetic in the
soulful eagerness with which he looked round for a victim
as he passed to the dressing-room. However, nobody was
taking any, and the slugger probably refreshed himself by
dancing on his wardrobe.

Porta (loq) on Sydney: “Ah ! Sydney is ze
most unlucky place for Porta. I beat men in Melbourne,
Adelaide, and other places ; I come to Sydney and they
beat me. I break my arm once in my life, I break it in
Sydney ; I tink Porta better get tousand mile from Syd-
ney.” And this all in one breath.

“R.” strongly demurs to certain “communi-
cated ” statements made in this column re the bad treat-
ment meted out to the erstwhile champion pedestrian
aboriginal, Samuels, by “ his backers.” “ Samuels,” says
“R.,” “ was handled by one person who decided whether
Samuels should train, run, reside in Sydney, or camp at
Jimbour Station. Whatever share of profits was due on
Samuels’ victories his ‘ manager ’ received. If those who
helped to find stakes or risked their money on Samuels’
speed gave him ‘suits of clothes,’ &c., it was outside all
contracts. When cash was given Samuels it was promptly
taken from him by thugs and thieves. When Samuels
became schooled in the ways of the white pedestrian he
acquired a taste for woman and whisky. Then he and his
‘manager’ parted. Up to this time no more honest a
runner ever laced a shoe, and up to his distance no better
runner ever breasted a tape in Australia. Losing the
direction of the only man that could handle him, Samuels
drifted from bar to brothel, and from mia-mia to mad-
house.”

Re the bombast and bickerings of Melbourne
biking boodlers, a barracker for the L.V.W. writes :
“All the first-class racing men, with only one or two
exceptions, are in the employ of the bike-firms, and the
trade will stick to the league like glue.” This, of course,
is mere talking through the neck. Bicycle dealers, with-
out exception, are chiefly interested in getting bold advt.
for their goods, whilst the racing men they “ employ ”
are hungry for a cut from any fat stake that may be
offered. The fat stake which attracts the “champions”
also attracts the public, whose gate-money provides it,
and any race-promoters who can get the use of the best
track in Melbourne (which is, at present, the St. Kilda
track), and guarantee handsome, attractive prizes, offer
the chance of a more or less valuable advt. to the bikes
that carry the principal winning riders. Where is there
any special inducement to “stick to the league like glue ” ?
The general public, without whose patronage no bike-
racing show can be successful, don’t care a curse about
the patronage of the L.V.W. They know that the league
ter-rembled the other week when Billmartin showed his
teeth.
» * * *
The second half (or rather the third and fourth
quarters) of the L.V.W. meeting at Melb. Exhibition
provided precious little entertainment for the public in
general. A lean programme was dragged out to cover
about 61 hours, afternoon and evening, the total amount
of stake money being £225, inclusive of 30 sovs. dis-
sipated by the spendthrift League in two-and-sixpenny
doles for “pacing” the Fifty-mile Championship A
Third-Class scratch race accounted for £l5 of the outlay,
and this exciting event was cut up into eleven heats
(averaging five entries, and fewer starters, per heat), two
semi-finals, and one grand final—l 4 races in all, for prizes
of £B, £5 and £2.
The two-mile Autumn Handicap, with a first
prize of £3O, failed to tempt Parsons, Edwards, Eelph,
Porta, Martin, or Ken Lewis into the arena, but three
scratch men —Megson, Walne, and Green —showed up for
the 6th heat, and in the final run the Englishman was
out-paced, or out-generaled, by his Australian rivals. This
proved to be the one livel y heat of the afternoon.
A noticeable weakness in the tandem racing
was the limit men’s neglect to make much use of their
handicap. In each heat the leaders appeared to wait for
the rearmost tandem to get right up to them, after which
came a slow processional period, terminating in a short
series of sprints. Relph and Walne, starting at the 50-
yards mark, won the final in good style from Carpenter
and March, who had previously beaten the time (6min.
41sec.) by 3sec. in their trial heat. It was a popular
victory, on account of the winners’ pretty costumes among
other reasons.
Green and Edwards, advertised as “ star ” per-
formers in the tandem race, didn’t start, after all. A
cablegram from ’Ome, it was said, had forbidden the
illustrious pair to ride with other than a Simpson chain,
and the Si mpsonic appurtenance wasn’t on the job. Next
in public interest to the Britishers came Megson and
Payne, whose machine broke down in the first lap of their
heat. Bilmartin and J. Carpenter figured only on the
scratching-board, whilst Porta and Boidi figured nowhere,
save in the programme-book. The scratching of the
Italian tandem was not stated on the board. So much
for the League’s management of cycling sports.
The bright star of the meeting was Megson,
whose performances even beat his record of three years
back. Mile-champion of Australasia and 50-mile cham-
pion of Vic., the horse-faced Joe returns to Sydney
cycling hero of the day.
Second only to Megson comes Tebbutt, the
Hawthorn lad, who was practically unknown before last
Foundation Day. He was nothing more than a
name until the '96 Austral, when he won his
heat so well as to be much fancied for the final; but
therein he finished with the field and fell back into
oblivion. At A.N.A. sports on Foundation Day, Tebbutt
started for the £’3so two-mile handicap from 210 yds., and
won easily. At Beechworth he was brought back to
140 yds. in the same distance, and won. Reduced to
70 yds., he took the Federal Handicap at the first day of
the League’s meeting, and on Saturday last, brought
back to 40 yds., the same mark as Payne, he beat that
representative Australian cyclist in the run home of the
Autumn Handicap by a couple of lengths; but he fell
close to the start of the final of this event. In the 50-
Mile Championship he made a fine half-lap battle with Meg-
son, pacing the champion from the rear in great style, and
only finishing at the axle of his front wheel. Body, the
ex-Maorilander, was responsible for the major part of the
public interest in the big race—he kept the pace a cracker
throughout, and led for 94 laps out of the 250.
The Autumn Handicap final easily fell to young
J. A. M‘lnnes (190yds.), the S. Melb. lad who has always
been going to win something big for the last three years.
Walne and Walker started from scr., but after Tebbutt
(on 40yds.) fell, Walker was left to pace himself up, which
he did in style. Don Walker is riding now better than
he tver did before.
Both days of the meeting, the bookies yelled
the odds as openly as at Flemington. The League tried
to get the betting stopped, but the police pleaded that
they had no power.
The handsome jaw of Bilmartin appeared not
on the track either day or night, its owner being vaguely
understood to be ill somewhere. It is rumored that, like
Samson of old, Bill has had his hair cut.
A touching instance of unselfishness was ob-
served during the progress of the 50-mile race, when
Meg'son handed a famishing rider at his side half the
chewing-gum he had been munching consistently since
the start.
* • * *
Who edits the L.V.W. programmes, anyway
J- A. M‘lnnes, the lightning boy, flashed home first by Tit
lengths for a heat of the Autumn Handicap. Little Mac’s
name was not listed anywhere among the entries, conse-
quently the industrious gentlemen who promote silver
“ sweeps ” among the crowd, charging about 20 per cent,
commission for their trouble in the ordinary way, must
have had a skinner this time. Nobody drew the winning
number.
* * * *
X.Z. : “The Syracuse Cycle Co., of U.S.A.,
has sacked its racing-teams and put on 30 travellers
instead,' each with his own district to work. A good
machine will sell itself by making every rider of it an un-
conscious canvasser. A million “ records ” won’t main-
tain a continuous market for a bad article. Moral :
Record-teams are a bad spec.”
* * * *
“ Emus out back,” writes “fix 8,” “ are greatly
puzzled by bicycles. They will follow a cyclist for miles
across a plain, and if the rider stops come with out-
stretched necks and eyes filled with curiosity right close
up to him.”
* • * *
The civilising influence of the bike : all boxing-
news now comes from the U.S., London, and Johannes-
berg. In this country, boxing-matches are as rare as
clever Postmasters-General, and the heavy-jawed slugger
has given place to the brawny-legged plugger.
* * * *
The law relating to art-unions is more stringent
in M.L. than elsewhere. Suburban brick houses, and
potato-patches, and go-carts and things don’t come under
“ works of art.” Articles offered must be artistic, or no
permit. Yet bikes are “art-unioned” every week in
conjunction with “ daubs.” The difficulty is got over by
painting flowers, flies, frogs—anything, on the wheels,
thus bringing them under the standard. Cute and
curious.
* * * *
The Beeston-Humber bicycle will keep in front
through sheer merit. At the last night’s meeting of the
N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League every event on the pro-
gramme was won by a Beeston-Humber, and Megson’s
recent performances show what a champion the popular
Australian is when mounted on a champion machine.
Payne, too, has done remarkably well since he mounted a
Beeston-Humber. *

The will of an eccentric Sydney man,
settled in both criminal and civil jurisdiction of
N.S.W. Supreme Court nearly a quarter of a cen-
tury ago, is again on the tapis. It is now said
that the “ rightful owners ” are on hand, and that
big disclosures are imminent.
Some Convention items. Adye Douglas
(Tas.) is the oldest delegate, 82 years. Then come
Moore (Tas.) 74, and Graham Berry (Vic.) 75.
Twenty of the fifty delegates are Australian-born,
most of the others were born in Great Britain,
three in Ireland. No delegate was born out of
the British dominions and no delegate bears a
foreign name except Piesse, a Westralian repre-
sentative. Twenty-five delegates are lawyers—
N.S.W. six, S.A. six, Victoria five, Tasmania
four, Westralia four. Six N.S.W. delegates were
born in that province, and a seventh, Lyne, in
Tasmania. Victoria has five natives, S.A. four.
Six Tasmanians were born in England, a seventh
in Ireland, and three are natives.
John Norton’s luck sticks to him. Ar-
raigned last week for having, in Sydney Truth,
described William Freeman Kitchen as a “biga-
mist and wife-deserter,” defendant pleaded “not
guilty a plea which, if raised in a civil action
for libel, would mean practically anything, barring
justification; but which, when raised in a criminal
prosecution, signified nothing but a bald denial of
haying done what was imputed. And, as it was
quite clear that the pugnacious Norton had done
what he was charged with, the judge said he
couldn’t see what the jury was disagreeing about.
The fact was, however, that the jury saw that
Norton’s plea technically prevented him from
raising his real defence and offered a bar to the
merits of the case being enquired into ; not being
lawyers they couldn’t see why all the facts and
gossip concerning Mr. Kitchen’s matrimonial
affairs should not be placed before them so that
they could have a good yarn about the matter and
do lay justice between Jacky and his friend Kit-
chen. When the jury was discharged, after hope-
less disagreement, defendant promised, if re-tried,
to plead justification.

Vic. J.P.-dom is doing its worst to nullify
the Factories Act by dismissing cases for breach
wherever there is the slightest excuse, and by im-
posing the lightest fines when charges are proved.

Cecil Rhodes, the fallen buccaneer of
South Africa, struck an immortal truth when he
told the British Parliamentary Commission that
the blessed Hempire accepted thankfully and
without question all the bits of territory he had
successfully grabbed by shady processes, and only
assumed a shocked Christian attitude when he
grabbed at the Transvaal, and failed. If Jame-
son’s raiders had overset the Kruger republic,
Cecil Rhodes would probably have been made a

hanging about on the verge of a gaol.
In Boucicault’s dramas the Irishman is
usually a fine fellow who doesn’t pay his rint, and
the Englishman is a hard-hearted savage who

the inflexible property-owner has become such a
popular article of faith that one is shocked to find
Michael Walsh, at Carlton (Melb.) court, screw-
ing rint from Alfred Pearce by means of a fraud
summons. Pearce failed to comply with an order
of the court made in December, for payment of £6
odd. His wife had been confined in the meantime,
he said, also his earnings had come down to 17s.
per week, therefore he sought temporary exemp-
tion from a settlement of Michael Walsh’s claim.
The result was not in accordance with melodrama
doctrines. Two magistrates (one of them named
Foley, begorra !) “made an order for the im-
mediate payment of the amount, with 335. costs,
in default 14 days imprisonment. The defendant
asked for time to pay, but this was refused. The
decision created astonishment in court.”
Ed. Bulletin, —The Argus (13th March,
’97) on sealed pattern riflemen :
In the regiment there has been the keenest interest
over the selection, and it is an open secret that members
of the Legislature, public men in other walks of life, and
even ladies, have written urging the merits of particular
men. All such influences Colonel Price ignored, and
picked the men on their build and smartness as they stood
on parade, inquiring from the drill instructors only as to
the attendance at parade and length of service.
Mark carefully ! Not for efficiency, good soldier-
ing, or character (have they defaulter-sheets in
Vic. army ?), but for build and smartness on
parade. Just judged like a bullock, by his points
and beef. That’s how “ Fire-low ” chose them.
Even the breeding and pedigree, supplied by
public men and ladies, would not influence “ Lay-
’em out.” “ It’s —aw —style—aw, I want: not
use. Loyalty and royalty only recognise style ! ”
I thought that “all hair” or “moustache” was
the regulation at home now. But in Victoria we

Two of the chosen ones were informed that they would
have to grow a moustache before the date of sailing,
while another was instructed to sacrifice a fine fair beard,
which had been trimmed to the characteristic Blue Jacket
point.
Argus again, trimmed :—
There was little difficulty about a sergeant, however,
for Sergeant Strong, who is a son of Councillor William
Strong, the Mayor of Melbourne, has just the cut of a
smart, well-built rifleman. None of his rivals had a
chance with him.
The writer remembers being asked to select two
volunteers for the Royal Horse Artillery. The
adjutant, old “ Jock ” Everett, came up from the
Dep6t at Canterbury to pass them. The chosen
men were both disqualified, one for his long
defaulter sheet and the other for his small ohest-
measurement. But the others who went were not
picked solely for smartness on one particular
parade nor for their length of service. I suppose
the two unfortunates who have to grow their
moustaches will be dipped. I can recommend
“ phenyle.” Perhaps the whole squad had better
be run through the trough and then they’ll be
physically clean, which is what seems to be wanted.

- - - MIRACULQ jS CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfaline Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for tht-se health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Imtnediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W. A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branehes are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re- j
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform

The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press:—
Sydney Bulletin. —“ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing
many great cures, whioh his numerous testimonials will
prove.”
Evening News, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen has
shown us some highly complimentary testimonials, certi-
fying to important cures effected by his remedies.”
North Melbourne Advertiser.—“ Herr Rassmussen’s
wonderful Herbal Alfaline Remedies have done more good
than all other known remedies put together.”
N.Z. Times, Wellington. — “ Herr Rassmussen manu-
factures some excellent Blood and Nerve Remedies.”
Daily Telegraph, Launceston, Tas.—“Herr Rass-
mussen is a clever botanist.”
B. A. Register, Adelaide, S.A.—“Herr Rassmuasen’s
Press notices agree as to the skill he possesses as a
botanist, and the bona fides of his testimonials appear to
be well established.”
Conktown Courier, Queensland. —“ Herr Rassmus-
sen, we are glad to say, holds the highest place in the
colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”
Flashes (Society Paper), Brisbane, Q.—“ Herr Bass-
mussen’s labors have resulted in a manner most gratifying
to himself, inasmuch as he has received the highest re-
cognitions of the most important scientific authorities.”
Chemist and Druggist .Journal, Melbourne.—
“Herr Rassmussen has opened a branch depfit at 150
Bourke-street, Melbourne, and his Alfaline Pills will pro-
bably become as well known in Victoria as they are in
New South Wales.”
Evening Journal, Adelaide.—“ Herr Rassmussen
has achieved a high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanical remedies.”
Sydney Truth. —■“ Herr Rassmussen is sufficiently well
known not to r< quire any additional praise from Truth.

An Old Crimean Hero’s Story .
SERVED IN 17 SHIPS IN HER
MAJESTY’S NAVY.
INTERESTING NARRATION OF ’53.
FOUGHT AND BLED IN THE QUEEN’S
SERVICE.
From the Australian Military Gazette.
Although it is 44 years since the Crimean War
was fought and nobly won by England, we have
in our midst a veteran who can point with pride
to the fact that he was one of the heroes who
helped to thrash the Russians at that memorable
campaign. The gentleman in question is Mr.
Chas. Terry, of 485 Kent-street, Sydney, who has
been a temperance lecturer in Australia for some
time, having left the navy a few years ago. A
representative of our paper, wishing to find out
more about Mr. Terry, called on Mr. Terry, who
proved to be a chatty old gentleman of 66, and
who readily expressed his willingness to talk about
himself. In response to a few questions, Mr.
Terry stated :—“I joined the Royal Navy about
1853, and served during the Crimea in H.M.S.
Retribution, Captain Thomas Fisher, under
Admiral Dundas, bearing the flag of Rear-
Admiral Baines, and I bear the Crimean decora-
tion. I arrived in Australia at the latter end of
1877 in H.M.S. Sapphire, the Hon. Captain
Merry. I then joined the Diamond, under Cap-
tain Dale, on this station, and on leaving the ship
quitted the service for good, having in all served
in 17 ships in her Majesty’s Royal Navy, during
which time I was employed as Admiral’s, Commo-
dore’s, and Captain’s cook. In August of last
year I found myself at Emu Plains, being in the
employ of Messrs. M'Grath, fellmongers, employed
as cook. It was whilst there that I was taken ill,
towards the latter end of August. I attributed
my illness to exposure in periodically leaving a
hot kitchen to attend to some outside work. My
first symptoms were coughing, a spitting of blood,
and a bloody discharge from the kidneys of the
consistency of jelly. One man there was particu-
larly kind to me, and constantly stayed up with
me all night, giving me eucalyptus to inhale, and
continuously rubbing it into my chest, throat, and
stomach. This man kept constantly telling me to
clear out from Emu Plains and go to hospital,
otherwise, to use his own words, he said, ‘ You
will peg out.’ Feeling that he was likely to prove
a true prophet, I followed his advice, came to
Sydney, and took up my abode at 485 Kent-street,
where I still am living. I should, however,
mention that both Mr. and Mrs. M'Grath gave
me the highest of references, and regretted that
my bad health would not allow me to remain.
(These recommendations, which were of a most
satisfactory nature, he showed our representative.)
On arrival in Sydney I suffered from great pains
in the back and sides, and also under the ribs.
I could take no solid food, and entirely subsisted
on eggs and new milk, whieh my landlady pro-
cured for me. I went to see the Government
medical officer at Circular Quay, and was so
horribly weak that it took me an hour and ten
minutes to get there. He told me to strip, which
I did, and he then sounded me and asked me how
long I had been bad. I told him that from the
first it was about eight weeks, upon which he said,
‘ Get away man ; it’s chronic.’ He could not send
me to Little Bay, but suggested that I should go
to Liverpool Asylum at once, but I refused to go
there, and returned home. I then went to see the
Grand Chief Templar. I also saw ’his wife and
the Grand Lodge Secretary, and told them of my
pitiable state. With the assistance of Brother
J. C. Jones, late District Deputy of the Good
Templars, and the Grand Lodge Secretary, I had
medicine prescribed for me of various kinds, which
proved quite ineffectual, and afforded me no relief
whatever. I took no less than seven bottles of
eucalyptus, and even chlorodyne was prescribed
for me. I fell away lamentably, perspired pro-
fusely, and could not obtain any sleep. I was in
such pain that I could not shift in bed. My right
side was much the worst, and my breathing was
most labored and painful. I cannot be too grate-
ful to my friend, Brother J. C. Jones. He would
stay with me for three or four hours at a time, and
it was he that saved me from going to asylum.
One day a friend of mine read to me the account
of Boilermaker Jarvis’ wonderful recovery by
taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and I at once
procured a box. I had taken all but two, when
the blood-spitting and emission ceased. After
two boxes I was able to get up and move about,
and now, at the end of six boxes, feel almost well,
with the exception of feeling very weak. The
cure was MAGICAL, and I tell all my friends
and the general public that nothing but Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pills brought me once more before them to
agitate the temperance question, and on each
occasion I have met with a great reception. (Mr.
Terry here called our reporter’s attention to the
amount of useless physic he had consumed, and,
indeed, the amount of bottles reminded one of the
interior of a chemist’s shop.) lean speak in the
highest possible terms of the marvellous curative
properties of the Pink Pills. On my visits to and
lectures in the country I shall consider it my duty
to suffering humanity to recount my astounding
cure, and I trust I may be the means of saving the
the life of many a despairing mortal.—CHAS.
TERRY.”
(Signed on oath and in the presence of Charles
Lovely, J.P.)

blood, strengthens the nerves, and in this way

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing' cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.’’
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, ai d the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”-Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodtne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

A theatrical incident of the recent Con-
vention campaign, in Melbourne, was supplied
by those tricky old legal showmen, Gaunson and
Purves, Q.C, Gaunson, addressing the electors
at a suburban town-hall, remarked the presence
on the platform of a gentleman with whom he
had for long not been on speaking terms —“a
gentleman whose splendid efforts in the Federal
cause should not be forgotten,’’&c. Whereupon
Purves, the gent, in question, shook Gaunson by
the hand, and the tableau (entitled “Reconcilia-
tion ”) was greeted with immense cheering. Yet
neither got in.
The Eye-sight measure per post by the in-

eye-sufferers in the country to ascertain the data
necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection —
long sight, short sight, old sight. Full particulars

The beastly uncertainty of marriage again !
In Sydney Divorce-court the other day a lady
told this story: In her guileless youth she
married a man whose name did not transpire, but
who may be called Blank to economise pronouns,
and who described himself as a widower with two
children. After a while she discovered, or thought
she did, that his first wife was still alive, where-
upon she didn’t prosecute him for bigamy, or get
her marriage formally annulled, but simply left him.
Later she married Ryan, on which occasion she
called herself a widow. “ I wasn’t a spinster, and
I wasn’t a married woman and I wasn’t a widow,”
she said ; “ there was no word in the English lan-
guage to describe my condition. So I called my-
self a widow.” The next trouble was that the lady
wanted a divorce from Ryan on several grounds.
Whereupon Judge Simpson became interested,
and ordered that an inquiry should be made
as to whether the first husband really was
a bigamist, and whether the second hus-
band had incited the lady to falsely de-
scribe herself as a widow. And if it happens
to transpire in the course of the investigation that
the. first husband's first wife had a previous hus-
band living, so that the first husband was in
reality not married to her, but was legally attached
to his second wife, and consequently that the
latter wasn’t legally married to her second hus-
band and so doesn’t require a divorce ; or, if it
chances that the second husband of the first hus-
band’s second wife had also a first wife alive, or
some other interesting complication of the sort
arises, it will be interesting to know what Judge
Simpson proposes to do about it. Anyhow, it is a
rash thing for any Judge who wants peace and
quiet to dig up the relationships of such a badly-
complicated family. Almost anything might
turn up.
“ Timi Piripi ” obituarises a Maori chief
for The Bulletin
A Maoriland cable announces the death of Wiremu
Hoterene Taipari, a well-known chief of the Ngatitamatera
tribe, Thames River district. Taipari was chief owner of
the eastern littoral of Hauraki Gulf, and was a potent
factor in the throwing open of the Thames goldfield; The
dead chief was an excellent specimen of the semi-civilised
Maori. He dressed in the height of the prevailing Euro-
pean fashion, and his wooden mansion stood proudly
amidst the raupo whares of his fellow-tribesmen ; but he
was in many things a Maori at heart. Some twenty years
ago, finding that the art of carving had been lost by his
tribe, he imported an entire hapu of natives from
YVhakatane on the East Coast, and caused them to
erect a highly ornate meeting-house on his private
grounds, so that the Ngatitamatera might have before
them an object-lesson in the art of their fathers. Taipari
was instrumental in raising a corps of Maori volunteers,
and very smart they looked in their serge uniforms,
French-peaked caps, with Captain Taipari in command.
The deceased chieftain’s wife, jyferi Taipari, introduced the
first thoroughbred stallion into the Thames district, a
speedy animal named Potentate. At one race-meeting at
which Potentate competed, the fair owner arrived on the
course accompanied by two tohungas, or wizards, who
caused immense amusement by performing an incantation
from the grandstand which, it was confidently believed,
would render Potentate still fleeter of foot and stouter of
heart. Every Maori on the course had wagered on Meri’s
horse, and, when it was beaten by a short head, they
raised the Ngatitamatera war-cry, and, headed by the
indignant Meri, pursued the unfortunate jockey and
would have mauled him severely but for the intervention
of a strong force of police. But those roaring days are
past, and poor old Taipari has gone to his fathers, and
his place well be taken by descendants who have gradu-
ated at pakeha universities, and whose claims to gentility
are based upon considerations quite apart from deftness
in the use of the taiaha or a capacity for dying with an
arched back-bone and a face that blanched not to meet
the shades beyond the Cape of Spirits.

Some criminologists consider the. practice of tat-
tooing characteristic of the criminal type. But
it is also a characteristic of seamen—whose
criminal average is only ordinary. The truth
seems to be that anybody will start tattooing as a
pastime if there is nothing better to do. Tattooed
people are idle people, and idleness leads to crime.
Travelling along the Flinders, a little
while ago, writer stayed for one night at an
ancient-looking pub. On seeking his horse in the
morning, he stumbled across a whole cemetery
belonging to the place, conveniently situated be-
hind a bit of rising ground which hid it from view
of the road. A grim tale of the quality of the
fire-water dispensed of yore at that hostelry in r
turn for lambed-down shearers’ cheques.
There are said to he no old maids in
Russia. Public sentiment is so decidedly against
celibacy that when a woman reaches the age of
and still pines in single blessedness, she finds it
best to go off on a journey in search of a husband.
After some length of time she returns and an-
nounces herself a widow. Russian etiquette for-
bids any allusion to a deceased husband m the
presence of the widow, and is very convenient for
these ladies.

Some Sporting Topics.
One “Harold Benson ” has gone into the sweep
business in Tasmania as a rival of “Tatt.,” and issues a
circular which is full of good solid reason why no one
should trust him with a copper. Benson promises all
prizes and no blanks. He wants 50,000 subscribers to
send along 10s. each, and in return he promises three
first prizes of £BOOO, £3OOO, and £1000; £2OOO to be
divided among starters and non-starters ; 20 prizes of £lOO
each ; 40 of £5O each ; 100 of £lO, and 200 of £5, and a
“ good dividend” to all the other 49,400, or so, subscribers.
The “ good dividend ” is to be made up thus : the prizes
above-mentioned represent £20,000 out of the £25,000
subscribed, and with the other £5OOO Mr. Benson pro-
poses to back horses successfully on a large scale and win
enough to give a round sum to everybody. If the “ good
dividend ” amounts to even 55., whieh would be pretty
miserable, Mr. Benson has to win over £12,000 to pay it
with, therefore he has to win more than twice the capital
he starts with. If he can win £12,000 in this off-hand
manner it is difficult to see why he should struggle with
the sweep at all; it only yields £2500, and expenses
have to come out of that, so he probably
won’t have quite £lOOO for himself, and why a
man with such a valuable knack of winning big
sums fpr other people doesn’t throw up this very un-
profitable business and win the big sums for himself in-
stead, passes comprehension. Benson claims to have
special knowledge which will enable him to scoop large
sums for his clients with certainty, but as The Bulletin
never heard of him before this rests mainly on his own
authority. Considering the present impoverished state
of the Bing, however, it is dead certain that if Benson
wins a very good dividend for his clients he won’t be able
to collect it on settling day. The Ring hasn’t enough
money to stand having good dividends taken out of it by
any plunging philanthropist for the benefit of 49,400
clients. The writer knows nothing against or in favor of
Mr. Benson personally, but his circular has the misfor-
tune to look like an impudent attempt to take in the
great Australian juggins and loot him.
The “ private composition ” maggot has eaten
• nto every branch of Smellbourne society. The L.V.W.
’was recently requested to take over a debt of £2l con-
tracted by the Vie. Racing Cyclists’ Association, prior to
incorporation with the League. Seemingly it was a fair
request, and the League felt anxious to keep the financial
honor of professional biking management spotless before
the world. “ Mr. Salter moved, and Mr. Comber seconded,
that the matter should be referred to the executive com-
mittee, with power to compromise the debt if they thought
fit. Carried.”

The chief day of the year at Hobart is regatta-
day, and to make the affair a success the committee goes
round town collecting subscriptions from citizens. One
of the committee of last regatta entered an antiquated
little boot-shop and addressed a venerable old man behind
the counter. “Can you give me a subscription for the
regatta?” asked the committee-man. “Eh ! what 1” was
the acrimonious answer. The visitor repeated his ques-
tion. “ Regatta,” said the man of leather—” did Christ
ever go to a regatta?” Somewhat flabbergasted, the
com.-man answered, “Perhaps not.” “Well, out you
so.” said the bootmaker. How very like Hobart!

Dear Bulletin, — Be Torrens Creek (N. Q.) horses
living on boiled meat from the local meat-works, Edward
Carpenter, in his delightful book, “ Civilisation: Its
Cause and Cure,” has a chapter on Custom, in which he
argues that a wolf of an enquiring mind would find peas
and strawberries nourishing enough. He instances cases
where dogs have made themselves nuisances in the garden
once they have acquired the habit of picking gooseherries,
&c., for home consumption. “Cats can be bred up to
live on oatmeal and milk with next to no meat; and a
sheep has been known to get on very comfortably on a
diet of port wine and mutton chops.” The present writer
knows of a Hawthorn (Vic.) pony which, against the en-
treaties and pulling of its child-rider, burglariously
entered a butcher’s premises and stole and ate a string of
sausages.—Huffy.

The proprietor of a well-known English weekly
thief-paper, who has just got a divorce from his wife,
ascribes her downfall from the paths of virtue to her
having taken to cycling and met a man-cyclist who told
her her legs were “ a dream.” As the thief-paper man
had evidently never told her this she went off with the
other fellow.

Yol. A. Ballinger, the M.L. shooting-champion
this year, is a slight and wiry man, aged 36 ; he is a tee-
totaller and non-smoker. Shooting has been his lifelong
hobby. In ’7B, he finished within 5 points of his brother,
W. H. Ballinger, for the championship ; was fifth in ’BB,
seventh in ’9O, fifth in ’92, and eventually won in ’93.
Next year he tied his brother for the coveted honor, and
this year put up a record in points. The Ballinger family
think of little else than bullets and bulls-eyes, and their
steadiness and proficiency furnish an object-lesson to
aspiring shootists.
The ladies’ matches, won by the Misses Whit-
ney and K. Gittos, were a feature of the late M.L. rifle
championship meeting. Of the 17 entrants, some shot
excellently, but others couldn’t fire for sour apples—one
actually hit the wrong target. One lady shot from her
back.

Bicycle horror from England. At Folkestone
the main road runs, in one place, down a long, steep hill,
at the bottom of which is an old-fashioned toll-bar. A
gate extends right across the road, and the driver or rider
stops and hollers till the toll-keeper comes out, and, hav-
ing been appeased by the monetary consideration pro-
vided in the bye-laws, opens the gate and lets them
through. A cyclist was coming down this hill recently
when his brake gave way, and he negotiated the
declivity at a fearful pace, yelling as he came to the toll-
keeper to open the barrier. The keeper didn’t hear him;
there was a crash ; and the cyclist was projected right
through the toll-house window, where he landed, minus
both his ears, on the dinner-table. The broken glass had
sawed the ears off in his hurried progress through the
window. But even this isn’t a much worse horror than
the N.S.W. affair in which a cyclist, whose bicycle had
bolted with him down-hill on to a barred bridge, was
thrown over the barrier and landed on his face. When
he got up he thought he had a big splinter in his nose,
and proceeded to pull it out and throw it away. Then he
found he had thrown away his nose.

Dear Bulletin, — Nicol’s patent starting ap-
paratus, mentioned in a recent issue, was tried in two
heats and the final of a race at Brunswick (Melb.)
bicycle sport, the other day. This apparatus has no con-
nection with the starting barrier known to horsey men ;
it is electrical and simple—strikingly simple—and, if the
conservative instincts of bike handicappers can be over-
come, should presently be found on every racing-track in
Australia. Young Nieol was ill-advised in selecting
Brunswick for an exhibition performance of his “ clock.”
There the democracy has the freedom of the path, and
the judge’s stand, and the place generally, and its
anxiety to boss the job militated somewhat against a satis-
factory exhibition. Sufficient was done, however, to
show the utility of the concern with proper sports
management and disqualification for the rider who lets
go before the machine gives him his signal. The ap-
paratus can’t lie, and that accurate handicapping can be
assured under its regime was fully demonstrated on
Saturday. Its chief advantage (and it has several) over
the present distance-handicapping system lies in the
fact that with its assistance an absolutely equitable handi-
cap becomes only a question of the ability or honesty of
the handicappers. At present the fairness of handicap-
ping depends mainly on wind and weather.—S.S.
As a bike-praiser, Dr. Philip Muskett, of
. Sydney, “ knocks ” even the most enterprising Yankee
agent. “ I am a passionate believer in the wheel . . . the
unrivalled exercise of cycling . . . makes thin men fatter
and fat men thinner . . . men who don’t begin until
they are 70 derive much benefit from it . . . cycling
cures indigestion . . . cures stomach catarrh, stomach-
dilation, stomach-neuralgia . . . rejuvenates men who
are physiologically older than their years . . . often cures
insomnia after every known soporifio in the whole phar-
macoposia has utterly failed ... it keeps down uric acid
in the system . . cures anaemia in women and 90 per
cent, of the functional ailments arising from ennui . . .
the cycle is a revolving panacea.” What pill-advertiser
could be more comprehensive ? Dr. Muskett quotes Dr.
Turner, the well-known British athlete-doctor, on the
connection between varicose veins and cycling. Turner’s
experience is that “ he has never seen the slightest in-
crease in any varicose conditions which could be ascribed
to riding.” Varicose veins, all the same, are more common
among cyclists than they are among other athletes ;
Zimmerman, the Carbine of cyclists, suffered greatly from
the trouble. Writer has heard from the lips of three dr
four top-notch cyclists that they were free from varicose
veins until they went in for track-racing. Of course,
racing isn’t ordinary cycling.

At Nanango (Q.) Land Court, the other day, a
witness deposed that he lodged applications (under the
moral ballot-system in a country where gambling is pro-
hibited) for 42 persons, the money for each being paid in
cheques drawn by his father; that he had an equal in-
terest in each of 22 of those applications, the successful
one of which was either to be “used mutually” or
“ transferred to one of his friends, who was likely to be
one of his own family.” He had made all arrangements
to buy-out the successful applicant. There were 60 ap-
plications altogether for this one ohance, a grazing-farm
of 3000 a.

Judge Gudgeon in Canterbury (M.L.) Press
in an article on “The Maori” “It has lately been my
good fortune to come across a very funny notice, which
was posted up on the door of a country hotel. It is so
thoroughly Maori that I did not dare to translate it
myself, lest it should be said that I had drawn on my
imagination ; hence I handed it over to one of the best
of Maori scholars, and his translation is as follows : ‘ Let
all men know that Christmas will be celebrated, and a
race meeting held, at Te Teko on the 25th Dec. All those
who patronise sports should assemble at that place, where
there will be amusement for us in honor of the new year,
and also to celebrate the advent of our Saviour from the
unknown, in order that He may know that we hold in
reverence and love His birthday, and may in consequence
remember and love us on the Day of Judgment.’ ”

Smith was the crafty possessor of two ponies,
A. and 8., either of them good enough to capture the
14-hand handicap at a meeting which shall be nameless.
Pony A. had the better public form, therefore Smith
decided to run both and win with outsider B. A long
turf experience had taught him to trust nobody save
himself with a stiffening job. On the cold, grey early
morning of the race Smith'sent A. for a ten-mile gallop
over the sandhills, after which he rewarded the animal
with a heavy meal of bran-mash, sufficient to “ stop ” an
elephant. The eventful hour found a crack jockey
mounted on red-hot favorite A., whilst a smart stable-boy
bestrode 8., who was backed by the owner for a fair
stake just before the flag fell. It was Smith’s race from
the distance—all the others out of it. A. and B. came
along together, the boy on the latter riding so shockingly
“ green ” that A. won by a nose. The public threw up
their hats, and Smith ruminated on the cussedness of the
wrong pony in carrying a 141 b. bran-mash penalty first
past the post. Then B’s rider sneaked up to him with the
news that he (the accursed urchin) had carefully allowed
A. to win for his employer’s sake. “I knew by the
betting that your stuff was on the other one,” said the
mannikin. And 8., like the steadfast dissembler that he
is, said “ Good boy 1 ” instead of “ Gawdam !”

The brothers Slaney were shifty as rats.
Mick, after rummaging the earth to its corners
and striking no money, made a sudden and inex-
plicable rise. He was gracious enough to hasten
death by indiscreet drinking, and Peter secured
the remnant —a few hundreds.
“ Lucky for us he pegged out so prompt,” re-
marked the remaining Slaney with the corners of
a grin, “ ’r else ther’d ’ve bin nothing left for us.”
“ Neither ther’ won’t,” said Mrs. Slaney.
Peter had forgotten his creditors, and was rue-
ful. Many of them clamored like the Damned,
whilst the others had given up, swindled and for-
lorn.
“Hell! ”he grunted, “ I never thought o’ ”
But Slaney was shifty, and an expert. He
paused for the development of thought, and then:
“ Course,” he added, “ ther’s a way out. A man
can make ’is ol’ woman rich, if he can’t hisself.’’
Mrs. Slaney, a natty little woman, observed
him with admiration, and wondered aloud why
she couldn’t scheme things out as Slaney did. She
supposed it was her ignorance of legal processes.
“You don’t know th’ game from two-up,” com-
mented the sententious Slaney.
* * * *
A week later Slaney skulked up to me and
tried to borrow sixpence wherewith to buy a drink.
From a hilarious night had proceeded a tremend-
ous morning thirst. Slaney said he had been
temporarily cleaned out —the established lie for
the occasion.
“Get out!” I said. “What’s come of that
legacy?” ,
“Gorne.”
“ I thought the missus had it safe ? ”
“Ow, she’s gorne, too.”
After gulping his beer Slaney detailed that his
most rapacious creditor had misappropriated Mrs.
Slaney, and rendered his financial claim pre-
ferential.
“Th” Missis knows th’ game orlright,” said
' Slaney.
I fancied there was a twinge of grief in his
voice, and invited him to drink again.
“Ow, it ain’t so much th’Missis,” he said, “as
th’ money, ’nd it ain’t so much th’ money as every
blarsted fool thinkern’ I can stuff up when I
carn’t.”

A Nasty Fall.
“ About six years ago, when residing in Hobart, Tasmania,”
said Mrs. Nellie Denver, of Countess Cottage, Double Bay,
Sydney, to a reporter, “I had the misfortune to meet with a
serious accident, which happened in the simplest manuer possible,
as P' will endeavor to relate. On leaving my house by the back
gate the bolt slipped, whilst I had hold of it, which caused me to
fall very heavily, which I subsequently discovered had seriously
injured my spine, although, strange to say, I felt no ill-effects for
about two years after. I then commenced to suffer from great
i It
* ~
weakness and dizziness, and an in-
tolerable feeling of exhaustion ; in
fact, I felt so nervous and uneasy
that I feared to cross the street,
alarmed that I might meet with
some accident from a passing
vehicle. Not at first recognising
the really serious condition to which
I was reduced, I did not seek medical
attendance, but when I at last be-
came aware of my serious condition,
I was persauded by my friends to
go to the Sydney Hospital, where I
remained two months without re-
ceiving any permanent benefit. On
leaving the hospital I again rather
neglected my state of health, and on
applying for re-admission was in-
formed that my case was perfectly
hopeless. Being unfortunately not
overblessed with this world's goods,
I obtained admission to the
.Newington Asylum, where I remained seven months : yet
still I got no better, being unable to swallow any nourishing
food. I then took two courses of electric baths, for which I paid
six guineas, and after them, with the exception of some slight
alleviation of my suffering, I cannot say that they did me much
good : in fact, I could not even walk, so I returned home feeling
very despondent, and imagining that there was no cure in store
for me. One day, on reading the daily paper, I noticed an account
of a marvellous recovery effected by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, and considering that this case (the one of Boiler-
maker Jarvis, suffering fromTloeoinotor ataxia) closely resembled
mine, I determined to make a trial of them, and sent a boy from
the house to buy some for me. I experienced relief after the first
box, and have steadily improved ever since ; my appetite returned
and I ceased to suffer from that terrible feeling of nervousness. I
am now in my seventh box. and can confidently assert that I am
most decidedly improved in health. My friends also notice a
marked improvement in my condition, a&d aau I entirely attribute
to the health-giving properties of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills; in
fact, it must be solely due to them, for I have tried no other
remedy. The proprietors of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are at per-
fect liberty to make whatever use they may think fit of this state-
ment, for I feel deeply grateful for the benefit I have derived from
them.”
Low Spirited and Weak.
Ax Unfortunate Condition fab too Common among the
Women of Canada.
Low spirited and weak is a condition that aptly describes the
condition of far too many women in this country. They are old
in appearance when they should be in the prime of womanhood.
They are martyrs to headaches, easily tired and indisposed to
exertion, and are pale and sallow in complexion. To those who
are thus unfortunately situated the following letter from Mrs.
Daniel Gavey, Gaspe Basin, Que., will point the road to renewed
health. Mrs. (jravey says : — <s For a number of years I have been
more or less of an invalid. I was low spirited, weak, and not able
do very much of the household work. My appetite was bad
and I suffered from headaches, and slightly from asthma. I used
several medicines with no beneficial results, and at last was
advised to try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. I used them for some
time, and am again enjoying the best of health. My whole system
is toned up, and with the other troubles the asthma has disap-
peared, I consider Pink Pills an invaluable medicine, and recoin-
mend them to the thousands of women who are suffering as* I was/*

A Vain Sacrifice .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He went by the name of Brown, but she
shrewdly guessed that he had adopted that un-
assuming appellation for reasons of his own. He
rented a small cottage in an outlying suburb, and
“ batched ” for himself.
One evening there had been a street row, and,
at the expense of a cut arm and a few scratches,
he had rescued her from the attack of a drunken
bully. Her gratitude led her to bandage his arm
and dress it every day. Then, seeing that he
could not very well manage, she came daily and
performed the household tasks. Gratitude on her
part soon deepened into a passion doglike in its
fidelity. He, on his part, was grateful, and finally
it came about that, in the neighbors’ delicate
phraseology, “she kept house for him.”
bhe kept it well. She was an excellent cook,
and always had the house spotlessly clean. Of his
private affairs she knew nothing, but in her own
mind he was a “toff.” In his bedroom was a
small brass-bound box which she never touched
even in her dusting. No wife could have loved or
served a man more faithfully than this half-taught
daughter of the people.
She did not know his occupation and he never
told her. He was absent all day, but always
spent his evenings at home. Often he would sit
in a silent reverie from which she never attempted
to rouse him. Once, sitting thus, he looked up
and caught her gaze. He passed his hand lightly
over her hair. She seized it, and, kissing it
passionately, rushed out of the room, her eyes full
of tears.
Poor soul! ” he said, lqoking after her. Then,
with a sigh, “What a curse love is!”
» * • •
Then he fell ill and developed typhoid.
It was a serious illness, and under any but her
nursing he probably' would have died. As it was,
it was a long and tedious road that he travelled to
recovery.
His first conscious glance lit on her face as she
knelt at his bedside. “ Dear 1” he said, and feebly
tried to lift her toil-worn hand to his lips. To his
surprise she snatched it away 7 and, rising hastily,
left him. She stood outside in the little kitchen
and wrung her hands. “ God ! ” she cried voice-
lessly, “ what will he say when he knows ?”
• * * *
At last he was well enough to be lifted into
an arm-chair and be propped up among pillows
and blankets. As she busied herself about the
room he watched her. She had seemed to avoid
him since his recovery, and something vague in
her manner troubled him. Often when she had
thought he was asleep she had crouched beside his
bed, and he knew* she had been crying silently.
“ Bessie,” he said, “ bring me that box and the
key off my chain.” She handed it to him. “ Hold
it, please, he said, as she would have turned away 7.
She did so, and watched him as with trembling
fingers that moved her woman’s pity he unlocked
it. There were some papers, and on the top of
them a small canvas bag. He slowly opened the
bag and then gave an exclamation.
“ Yr hat money have you been using ? ” he asked.
Her face faded to an ashy whiteness.
“ Don’t ask, ” she said, piteously, twisting and
untwisting her hands.
“ I do ask,” he answered, and waited patiently.
I borrowed it,” she said at last defiantly, but
wl “L a hopeless ring in her voice that touched him.
“That is not true,” he replied quietly, “you
know no one to borrow from.”
Suddenly she fell at his feet. “Can’t you
guess?” she cried wildly. “I sold everything I
could—then the man wouldn’t wait for his rent
and the doctor said you couldn’t pull through
unless you had all sorts of things. How was Ito
get them ? I never thought you had money in
your box. She waited a little, then with lowered
voice : “ I couldn’t see you die, so I did it.” She
knelt there and the tears trickled slowly through
her hands and fell on the floor.
\ ou don’t mean ?’ ’ he said slowly, and the
disgust in his voice cut her like a whip.
“ Yes,” she answered dully, “ there was nothing
else to do.”
She waited in silence, expecting a torrent of
abuse and half-cowering as from a blow, for she
did not know the ways of “ Mr. Brown’s 1 ’ class.
lhe silence at last became unendurable. “ Won’t
you speak to me ? ” she asked at last in tones whose
misery should have moved him.
“ There is nothing to say,” he replied coldly,
looking past her and turning his head aside
wearily. She rose as if to speak, but after one
glance at his face she stumbled blindly from the
room.
“ Faugh !” he said bitterly, for what she had
done seemed to taint him too.
He mended slowly, but still needed careful
nursing, and, though he hated himself for it, still
he was dependent upon her. He shrank from all
contact, but if he could have guessed the bitter
pain he caused her he would have shown his dis-
taste less.
* * * *
Night after night she spent sleepless, hud-
dling herself on the mean little sofa and striving
in vain for warmth, for all unnecessary things had
been parted with, and she did not consider blan-
kets for herself a necessary.
“He will leave me,” she said to herself, “and I
can’t bear that, God pity me ! ” and she clenched
her hands against her breast as if to still the cruel
pain.
* « * *
Through the evening days she was very
quiet, but she did not linger about him as for-
merly. Then came a morning when he was well
enough to return to his work. He dressed him-
self, putting aside her offer of help, but as he
was going she came to him, with eyes whose
hungry yearning was to haunt him in after years.
“Won’t you say good-bye?” she asked him, and
he was almost softened by the hopeless humility
of the tone.
“ Good-bye,” he said, coldly, but did not take
the proffered hand.
She stood quite still for a little while after he
had gone, then mechanically set the cottage in
order. Over his clothes she lingered with a loving
touch, then folded them away quietly. When all
was finished she knelt by' his bed and, laying her
head on his pillow, wept pitifully like a child.
STARLIGHT.
A record that licks Yankeeland. Joseph
Bond, of near the Glenelg river, has
grown potatoes running 8 to 10 feet long in the
stalk, (variety, “ White Elephant ”). Under his
10ft. stalk were found 55 large potatoes. His
brother, Robert, living about a mile off, grew on a
patch 11 yards each way, 22 wheatsackfuls of good
marketable spuds. That means 73 tons to the
acre, with only sheep manure and mighty little of
that. Robert Bond has also produced parsnips
running 81b. a piece, and 14Jlb. cabbages.
A Cup-day Courtship.
[FOR THE BULELETIN.]
Scene : Brighton Beach ; innumerable couples in
various stages of wooing. Aunt Sallies, swinging-
boats, etc., surrounded by hot and happy crowds.
He and she seated on the sand wearing each other’s
hats, and oblivious of onlookers.
She : “Oh, you, go on away, or I’ll give you sich
a smack in the faaaee.” (The sentence ending in
a prolonged drawl, a shrug of the shoulders, toss
of the head, and droop of the eyelids.)
He (slipping his arm round a waist that
wriggles under his grasp): “ Bit shy ; it’s a fishy
sort that sits a mile away from a good-lookin’
donah, eh ? ”
She : “ You move away, Bill ’Olt.” (Protest
in the form of a stiffening of herself, and shake of
the shoulders.)
He : “ Move away ! Not me. Come on closer,
we’re just made fer one another, eh ? ”
She: “Made fer yow ! Likely! Ellen Jane
Brown’s more your sort, little an’ stumpy, red
’air, an’ ”
He : “ Chuck that, Em’ly. ’Ere, come closer.”
She: “Keep yerself to yerself, Mister ’Olt, I
’ate you.”
He : “ Not you, you’re too ldnd-’earted ; you
wouldn’t ’urt a fly, an’ so why ’d you ’ate a poor
beggar who wants to get a kiss off them there red
lips?”
She : “ You try it on.”
He : “ I’m just goin’ to.”
She : “ You just better.’
He : “I know that.”
She : “ I’ll give you such a clip on the ears if
you touch me.” (Drawl more prolonged than
ever, injured dignity more intense.)
He : “ Good enough, here goes.” (Short struggle
provoking mild interest among neighboring
wooers.)
She (emerging flushed and breathless): “ You
do that agen, Bill ’Olt.”
He : Jes goin’ to—good, ain’t it ? ”
Gradual softening of coy beauty, more than
content at length with Bill’s ardent embrace. Sits
on his knee all the way back to town, in the
crowded, noisy, second-class carriage, and ex-
changes flashes of repartee with other damsels
similarly seated.
M.D.
“The Free Surgery.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ After all,” he remarked, apropos of nothing, as
we sped along in the Melbourne express, “ after
all, it is not a difficult matter to make a fortune.”
I looked up in surprise. The speaker was a
well-dressed, clean-shaven young man, and very
good-looking. His hand was extended in a
friendly way, and he smiled confidently. His
manner was certainly engaging.
“I wish I thought so,” I said in reply to his
observation.
“ Ah, that’s because you let your mind run in a
groove and don’t give ideas a chance. There are
hundreds of ways of making money, but the aver-
age man sees none of them. Fact is, he won’t
look.”
“ Is not capital an essential requisite?” I ven-
tured.
“ Not altogether, sir. To be without capital is
certainly a disadvantage, but that’s how I began,
and I liked it, sir. I would not have been
deprived of the pleasure of making my fortune
no sir, not for the wealth of nations.”
I had come to the conclusion that he was a
very amusing book-canvasser.
“ 1 was always a keen observer,” he proceeded
“ and, to be brief, the first thing of importance
that I noticed in this country was an unmistake
able demand for horrors of every description
The supply was deplorably limited and altogether
inadequate ; and, worst of all, no one was pushing
the business. Why, sir, when a man took a fit in
the street the people would crowd round in hun-
dreds. They were eager for that sort of thing, sir
and I knew there was money in it.”
His voice, which was like the purring of a cat
overcame me to an extent, and, with eyes half’-
elosed, I listened to his beautiful lies, while a
pleasant thrill played up and down my spine.
“I soon formed a scheme,” he said, “which I
laid before an impecunious young doctor of my
acquaintance. He laughed outright at first, but
was a sensible fellow and gave me a hearing’ and
when I get a hearing, sir, I generally carry my
point. It was the etiquette question that baulked
him ; but eventually he accepted my proposal and
we entered into partnership. Three weeks from
that day our Free Surgery opened its doors. Was
that quick work ? ”
He had begun to talk very rapidly.
“ We treated patients free,” heoontinued, “and
charged the public for admission. I managed
everything myself. I had teeth-extractions going
on all day on the left side, epileptic fits on the
right, and a specialty on the stage every hour.
They swarmed to us like bees—the public, I mean
—and we were coining money. Why, sir, I hadVa
gall-stone fished out of a man before 180 people
at half-crown a head. We had to get professional
assistance and larger premises and a man to shovel
the cash into bags and take it to the bank in a
barrow. I managed everything, sir. Well, the
surgery flourished for a year, and then the (trash
came. One of my dentists, a clumsy fellow, had
the misfortune to break a man’s jaw. Fact was
the man wouldn’t scream, and we had to have
screaming. The public wanted it. The authori-
ties came down on us with the whole medical pro-
fession at their backs. They closed us up, but it
was too late, sir, we had made our pile and were
rich men.”
The train stopped with a jolt, and when I had
pulled myself together my companion had alighted
at Goulburn station, and, hat in hand, was bow-
ing to me. I fancied 1 could hear his soft voice
saving, “ Good day, sir. I managed everything.”
CURRA CURRA.
After the Port Darwin cyclone, Chinese
carpenters were paid 12s. to 14s. a day for their
services, and careful they were to insist on the full
allosyance. The story is told that one contractor
was in the habit of paying 6s. a day wages and Bs.
a day commission. On protest being made by
other contractors this genius raised the wages to
10s. a day and pocketed the other 4s.
