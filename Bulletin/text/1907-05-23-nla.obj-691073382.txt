POEMS BY ARTHUR SYMONS
Unstable Bride.
Because her body is a tender thing,
Like powdered butterflies, that must remain
Brideless, if any hand have brushed their wing;
Or looking-glass that any breath may stain ;
Or flower that, being rudely handled, shrinks;
Or warm wax, that takes print from any seal;
Is it indeed for this that woman thinks
To have the power of man under her heel?
Yet why should his proud glory be obscured
Eor such a poor, proud, fond fragility,
Or her possession be with pride endured,
Because, possessed, she lacks security?
Why should she be honored of men because
She is dishonored by so easy flaws?
London.
The sun, a fiery orange in the air,
Thins and discolors to a disc of tin
Until the breathing mist’s mouth sucks it in ;
And now there is no color anywhere,
Only the ghost of greyness ; vapor fills
The hollows of the street, and seems to shroud
Gulfs where a noise of multitude is loud
As unseen water falling among hills.
Now the light withers, stricken at the root,
And in the evil glimpses of the night,
Men as trees walking loom through lanes of night
Hung with the globes of some unnatural fruit.
To live, and to die daily, deaths like these,
Is it to live, while there are winds and seas ?
Roman Meditation.
Learn wisdom, this is wisdom, cry
The teachers; and the teachers die.
What should it profit me were mine
The wisdom of the Antonine,
Or Blato’s ? What is it to me
If that be wisdom or this be ?
I know the same'unfaded world,
A pebble from the brook, is hurled
Forth from Time’s sling through endless ways,
And I shall have no part or place
Save in the pebble’s senseless speed.
Wherein shall wisdom to iny need
Minister? how shall wisdom save
From the last folly of the grave ?
The Andante of Snakes.
They weave a slow andante as in sleep.
Scaled yellow, swampy black, plague-spotted
white;
With blue and lidless eyes at watch they keep
A treachery of silence ; infinite
Ancestral angers brood in these full eyes
Where the long-lineaged venom of the snake
Meditates evil; woven intricacies
Of Oriental arabesque awake,
Unfold, expand, contract, and raise and sway
Swolu heart-shaped heads, flattened as by a heel,
Erect to suck the sunlight from the day.
And stealthily and gradually reveal
Dim cabalistic signs of spots and rings
Among their folds of faded tapestry ;
Then these fat, foul, unbreathing, moving things
Droop back to stagnant immobility.
Arab Love Song.
What matters it to me if the rain fall,
Since I must die of thirst ?. Her eyes are faint.
They faint with ardent sleep, faint into love:
Her eyes are promises she will not keep.
I ask no more ; let others give me all,
While she is miser of her beauty : all
Is nothing, but her nothing is my all.
Have I not loved her when I knew not love ?
Keep far from me that bitter knowledge; nay,
Why should I die? and if I know I die.
I have loved, and I have loved, perhaps, too much ;
If to have loved as I have loved be sin,
I pray that God will never pardon it.
A Song Against Love.
There is a thing in the world that has been since
the world began :
The hatred of man for woman, the hatred of
woman for man.
When shall this thing be ended ? When love
ends, hatred ends,
For love is a chain between foes, and love is a
sword between friends.
Shall there never be love without hatred ? Not
since the wprld began,
Until man teach honor to woman, and woman
teach pity to man.
O that a man might live his life for a little tide
Without this rage in his heart, and without this
foe at his side,!
He could eat and sleep, and be merry and forget,
he could live well enough.
Were it not for this thing that remembers and
hates, and that hurts and is love.
But peace has not been in the world since love and
the wqrld began,
For the man remembers the woman, and the
woman remembers the man.
From “ The Fool of the World, and Other Poems.”

The office understudy (who" writes political
editorials, various verse, and yarns when the
editor is wildly craving copy to fill up his gaping
columns—this occurs several times a century) is
dissatisfied with our suggested beginning of a
short story. He thinks “Hell !” is milk-and-
water compared to his yarn. It begins: “As,
after a busy day, Alice entered her boudoir, she
stumbled over five decomposed human bodies.”
A highly valuable work titled The Drought
Antidote for the North- West, by Bercy Allan,
principal Assistant Engineer for Water Conser-
vation, N.S.W., deals with technical thorough-
ness with the utilisation of the artesian resources
of this State. The book is copiously illustrated.
The “Alphabetical List of Bores in N.5.W.,”
elaborate as it was, disappointed us. This office
is thinking of compiling its own. :
THE AUSTRAHAN OF THE FUTURE
POKING at tlxe Australian through the
telescope of the centuries, what sort
of being do we find ? From the essays
contributed to this competition we
may make a brief abstract of those qualities
which the Australian of the years 2000 or
20,000 A.D. will possess. Arranged alpha-
betically, the Australian of the future seems
a somewhat heterogeneous bloke. Thus,
alphabetically, the Australian of the Future
will be -
An active, adaptable, all-over-the-place, am-
bitious, Americanised, animalistic, angular, arro-
gant, artistic, athletic, Australian—or (perhaps)
an Austral-Asiatic.
A brightly-dressed, brown-eyed Bloke. Also a
Boshter.
A careless Christian ; a capable, cautious, chari-
table, clean, clean-limbed, commercial, courageous
Citizen. He will also be a Catholic and a Chow.
A dark-complexioned, dark-haired, democratic,
despondent, disciplined, dusky, Decent chap.
Easy-going, energetic, and enterprising.
A facile, far-sighted, fatalistic, free Fine
Fellow.
A generous, genial, good-tempered, Grecian,
gregarious Good Grafter.
A healthy and healthy-minded Humanitarian.
An inactive, imaginative, impulsive, independ-
ent, individual, industrious, intelligent, inven-
tive Internationalist.
Just—and j ust a Jap.
A law-ridden, lean, light-hearted, lithe, long
Lord of Liberty.
A materialistic, muscular, musical Manu-
facturer. Also, he will be a Mongrel.
Original, an Object-lesson in civilisation, an
Omar Khayyam, and One of nature’s whitest
gentleman. Usually he will be On the land.
A pagan, pale, patriotic, plucky, practical
Philosopher and Precedent-maker.
A reflective, resolute Republican, a Realist in
literature.
A scientific, sea-faring, selfish, self-confident,
self-reliant, self-supporting, serious, sexually
indulgent, shrewd, slim, sober, sociable, social-
istic, speculative, square-jawed, strong, sunny,
swarthy Sport. He will also be a Straight-
Shooter, a Smoker, and a Superman, and Six feet
high.
A tall, tired, tolerant, tough Type who Thinks
in continents.
An upright Utilitarian.
Vain-glorious, virile, and (because vice will be
expensive) virtuous.
A well-dressed, wide-awake, wine-drinking,
wiry, woollen-wearing White Australian. White
right through. He is also What we make him
to-day.
Finally, towards the tail-end of the alphabet,
he will be a Yellow man.
Then there are several things that the
Australian of the future will lack. Thus,
agaip alphabetically :
He will not be cynical, dyspeptic, irreverent,
melancholy, nomadic, pitying, poetical, polite,
sentimental, nor servile. He will not haunt
the pub, lean against a post, gamble, nor
play cricket. He will not go in for horse-racing,
because the only surviving horses will be in the
Zoo. He .will not kowtow to anybody. He
won’t be a hatter, a tramp, a secessionist, or a
white King Billy. Also—which might have saved
us much trouble in classifying him—some of our
prophets cheerfully consider that he won’t be at
all.
Of the essays, five survived most of the
tests—those written by Frank Hamilton,
Charles Whitham, R.8.H., John B. Castieau,
and Fred Davison. But W. Brenta, William
H. Elsum, and “Tantalus” (Childers),
while supplying excellent matter, largely
exceeded the thousand word limit—else one
of these would probably have taken first place.
Of the others, those written by Charles
Whitham, Lynchford, Tasmania, and by
Frank Hamilton, 36 liichardson-st., Albert
Park, Melb., are adjudged the best, and, as
each so excellently shows a different aspect
of the question, the editor has decided to
divide the prize between them. A cheque
for one guinea has accordingly been sent to
each of these writers.
The Future Australian.
What will the Australian be like in 2000?
Well, the type will be quite as unsettled, if not
more so, than at present. The vacant spaces in
America will be tilled up within the next genera-
tion, and, with cheapened means of communica-
tion, the tide of European emigration will be
turned eastward. Let us, therefore, fix a later
date ; 200,000 will not do, the stretch is too vast,
and the man of 200,000 years hence may differ to
an extent of /which we can no more form a con-
ception than the cave-dwellers of the Dordogne
could predict the civilisation of 1907.
I assume, t ten, that Australia has been peopled
for some three or four centuries by a fusion of
European races, the leuto-Keltic tvpe predomi-
nating, but with a large admixture of Latin and
Slavonic elements. The Mongolian races have
effected lodgments and founded settlements at
various times on the Northern coasts, but have
been beaten back, leaving traces of their occupa-
tion in the language of the continent, and in the
blood of our Northern peoples, remaining an ever-
present danger, and disputing the lordship of the
Malayan regions with the Commonwealth.
We shall speak the English tongue, in many
dialects, with many strange words and new
idioms, to express modern meanings and nuances,
ihe interchange of literature, and the rapidity of
communication will maintain a standard written
English, common to Britain and her daughter
States. As to literature, shall it not be an
adequate expression of the national spirit, quali-
fied by world-wide developments ? We may have
produced no Shakespeare, no Beethoven, no Da
Vinci, hut the appreciation of Art, and the capacity
or expression, will be more widely diffused than
:n Britain.
But which will be the Australian type, in which
pone will be the greatest concentration of popula-
tiou ? For national character is immediately,
very largely, in secular development entirely,
determined by climate and physical environment.
We are obliged to dogmatise, and to assume
that the greatest concentration of population will
be in the districts at present settled, from Hobart
to Oooktown. This gives a range of 28 degrees,
as wide as between London and Mandalay, too
great for the loosest generalisation. The typical
American lives between Minneapolis and INash-
ville, a distance no greater than between Twofold
Bay and Tentertield. V
Let us say that our Australian lives between
the latitudes of Melbourne and Toowoomba, and
even then ive shall have differences of climate and
production as great as the- contrast between
JJevonshire and Egypt. Most of the people,
though, will live in climates similar to those of
the countries bordering on the Mediterranean,
the regions that produced the Greek, the Roman,
the Spaniard, and the Jew. And outside of
these countries, we shall have the mixed popula-
tions of the Northern coasts, assimilating gradually
the speech, the customs, and the inodes of living
of the Malay and Southern Asiatic peoples, with
the ruddy, insular Tasmanians and the isolated
West Australians ; for a thin ribbon of railway
will not make the dwellers of the West one nation
with the inhabitants of the Eastern shores.
In the 25th century, then, a homogeneous popu-
lation will have evolved, in the Eastern and
Central States, out of various race ancestors ; a
population of dark-haired, swarthy men and
women ; but there will be many blondes to pride
themselves on their Tasmanian and Monaro
blood, and aristocrats to point to their
descent from the Wentworths, Macarthurs,
Bartons and Forrests. The Australian will be
less irreverent than now. There will be mighty
names of his own countrymen to honour; the
stress of fighting for the homeland will have given
a pride of country which is now absent, or half-
ashamed of itself. Local myths and historical
legends will be taught to the children, who,
descended from sixteen generations of Austral-
born ancestors, will regard the misty traditions of
Waterloo and Trafalgar as we faintly recall the
wisdom of Alfred and the exploits of the Con-
queror.
The exotic customs and dress of Britain will
have been modified or discarded : the Christmas
plum pudding cannot long survive in an alien
environment. In religion, to proceed from
analogy, the Australian should be a Catholic; his
creed and ritual will be sensuous and ornate. The
Church will have purged itself of the fabulous and
legendary elements of its present teachings, so
that honest and intellectual men may yield assent.
Mysticism will not however, be abolished ; the
belief in a life after death, the impregnable fast-
ness of religions, will remain the cherished posses-
sion of nearly all the women, and of a great por-
tion of the men.
The Australians will live under a bureaucratic
Federal Republic, held together by the preponder-
ance of the central states, the president the chief
functionary in a hierarchy of officials, with the
element of popular control embodied in the form
of a direct vote by the people. The control of
the great factories, of the industrial mines, of the
banks and financial institutions, will have passed
to the State, but thesystem will not be a logical
one. As in religion, there will be many survivals
of individualism, many anomalies. After many
struggles, the advocates of a consistent regimenta-
tion of society will have admitted that the natural
instincts of energetic men for independent action
cannot be repressed, and that a society that
petrifies dies.
The national existence of the Australian, and
his control of the Southern seas, will depend on
the maintenance of a strong navy, and he will
maintain the traditions of forefathers on the sea.
His Republic is not likely to absorb the Maori-
landers, but the' two nations will be compelled to
a close alliance by common interests.
Charles Whitham.
The Australian of the Future.
There is no place more lonely, more isolated
than Australia is to-day. On east, west and south
roll leagues of ocean, and on the north ,we have
neighbors that we despise. Our continent might
be expected to attract population quickly. But
the people who would readily come are the people
we despise, and their coming would be resisted,
at bayonet point, if necessary. And the
people we would welcome see in Australia a
country and a people far away, of uninteresting
appearance, and not very rich. Our destiny will
be worked out by ourselves. When Australia
rises on the horizon, her success will have been
achieved by the toil, enterprise, and intelligence
of her own people. The struggle will make us a
people of strong individuality, an individuality
intensified by our isolation. Newcomers will be
absorbed into our life, and their modifying
influence will be slight.
Large though Australia be, it is, in physical
features and vegetation, strikingly onecountry; and
everywhere a bright sun reigns. Its people are'our
people. The Queenslander, lithe, straight, clean-
limbed, careless, sunny, buoyant; the New South
Welshman, well-fleshed, sinewy, genial, generous,
broad-minded ; the Victorian, active, sturdy, busi-
ness-like, democratic, public-spirited ; the South
Australian, solid in body and mind, frank, social;
the Westralian, hybrid of all States, open-eyed,
progressive, fraternal: all have a close family
likeness. They are permeated with the same
spirit, and animated by the same ideals ; the spirit
is utilitarian, arid the ideals mostly materialistic.
What does he ask from life ? A decent living and
human fellowship. His demands are tinctured
by two concepts: that he is entitled to these
things, and that society may be adjusted so that
he shall have them.
The history and environment of the Australian
have made him essentially practical; possessed of
a brain like his body, naturally active, ready,
powerful, he is fond of, effective work ; in busi-
ness shrewd, enterprising, speculative, but stipu-
luting for “ a fair run for his money anxious for
results, he is inventive; desiring wealth as a
means to comfort, and satisfied with “a fair
thing,” he is easy-going ; bright shies and a balmy
air encourage a benign inactivity, but a resolute
spirit and a square jaw front drought and pes-
tilence. Hissense of justice is acute, and the
loafer and the drunkard blame the right culprit,
and disappear without fuss. He gives his friend-
ship readily, and expects a return, demanding
genuineness so strongly that formality and senti-
mentalism are abhorrent. In government, a bold
experimentalist. In literature, undeveloped, imi-
tation or realism being the only thing possible.
His womankind shares his spirit. In adversity,
self-reliant and helpful ; in prosperity she enjoys
life frankly ; more refined than her mate, she
dresses better, and is fonder of Art.
Starting from a materialistic basis, the Aus-
tralian has ideals, though now almost inarticulate,
as high as imagination reaches ; they include the
attainment of the super-man and many Utopias.
The characteristics which presage some success in
realisation are: love of physical health, sound
common sense, unquestioned courage, adapta-
bility, sociable disposition, sense of justice, good
temper, power of self-government, horror of
ostracism.
“The genius of a people is within a people,”
and Australia’s struggle will be successful. The
struggle will eliminate some weaknesses, and other
influences modifying the type of her people will
be her flat, neutral-tinted country, her genial
climate, her glorious sun. The future Australian
will be tall, active, with good shoulders and'chest,
and lighter lower limbs; complexion pale to
dusky, eyes either grey or brown, square jaw,
broad forehead, hair dark and abundant, teeth
good, digestion excellent, muscles supple rather
than stiff-set. Tobacco he will continue to use ;
his liquor bill will be small, wine, mostly from
Westralia, being the staple ; meat as food he will
use once, or at most twice, a day. He will be
clean in person and habits ; fond of sunshine
and open-air life ; addicted to sexual indulgence,,
but not to the point of degeneracy ; fond of dress,
color, brightness, motion, entertainment; fond of
music in every form, and of painting. He will
read politics, criticism, tales of imagination,
analytical novels; he will be an effective writer
in the same fields; poetry he won’t care for ; his
humor will be dry and epigrammatic. He will be
an excellent man of affairs, and will be specially,
successful in invention, architecture, engineering,
experimental science and organisation. His type
will be his own : an Englishman in organising
power, an American in alertness and shrewdness,
a Frenchman in his idea of life as a thing to be
enjoyed, a touch of the Arab in a certain rigor of
habit and in susceptibility to feminine attraction,
something of the old Athenian is his belief in
Government, His real religion will be founded
on the texts, “ Ye are members one of another ,”
and “ Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he' also ■
reap.’' Nevertheless, he will be fickle and apt to
follow the crowd; selfish, but ready to be restrained
by the force of public opinion ; somewhat hard
and cold, lacking the feminine quality of pity—he
will be a masculine humanitarian.
In seaport towns, the type will be modified by
the type of the American ; but he will not be a
dweller in cities, though towns will be numerous.
He will have spread over his continent; transit
will be easy ; electricity everywhere used, the
motive-power being liquid fuel derived from the
quick-growing eucalyptus; irrigation will be
general ; factories wili be near the source of
supply. He will be a keen critic of government,
which will control monopolies and enterprises
when defined principles rather than energy are
required ; and whose functions will be enlarged
with the object of preventing any man from be-
coming a nuisance or an oppressor. The profes-
sion of law will cease ; trading will be a matter of
co-operation.

be given in a later issue.]

A truthful picture of the Australian west is
prosaically given by the Rev. James Green (of
Ballina), in The Selector, a-Romance of an Immi-
grant (N.S.W. Bookstall Co.; 2s. 6d.). Without
any literary art, Green writes of the little things
he knows about, and unfolds a story of a plucky
selector in the toils of the N.S.W. land laws, who
by his manliness fights down opposition, and
wins success. It is a pleasant and wholesome yarn.
The illustrations are by A. J. Fischer.
Among that ancient race, the Berbers of
Morocco, Sidi Hammo was the most famous of its
many wandering singers. The Berbers have no
written language; but Sidi’s songs have been
treasured by his people for five centuries. S. L.
Bensusan has now edited The Songs of Sidi
Hammo (Elkin Mathews), with translations of his
verses. Some are worth quoting
What sin have I wrought, that unless I speak
her name I feel my heart breaking ?
Stretch skyward, Atlas, till thou’rt weary.
Across thy brow there comes a road. So much
for pride !
The pauper, though he lives, is dead.
To hell with earth if Love be no longer of it!
Allah! The torch vows safety to the gun-
powder !
Dead love were better buried. Pile earth upon
it, lest, Allah forbid, it come to life again.
What sweeter heaven here ? What more bitter
hell? Surely, “I love thee,” and “I love thee
not.”
The jackal [woman] has never been to school,
nor learned to recite a text. But he [she] has a
memory, rarely forgets, and guesses the rest.
Re the Australian of 2000 A.D. (writes “Pol-
stan ”), I sat down to win the 44 bob, but an
uncanny vision of a slit-eyed, pigtailed gentleman
leaning against an elaborate lamp-post with a red
paper lamp thereon troubles me, q,nd I can’t go
on. Confound your essay! Why can’t you call
for something that won’t give a fellow the jimjams
to think about ?

The Evidence & Reason Why
TEETHING
Without Trouble
The Evidence
from
3 Pritchard St.,
Marrickville,
N.S.W.
July 9 th, 1906.
“ I gave my little Triffie,
who was very delicate, and
suffered severely from diarr-
hoea while teething, Scott’s
Emulsion, and from the first
dose I noticed an improve-
ment ; she was able to digest
her food, the diarrhoea grad-
ually ceased, and she has
cut five teeth without any
trouble. My little one is
now well and rosy.”
(Mrs.) T. M. VOGAN.
THE REASON
why she is rosy
Strength—that is the secret,
and Scott’s Emulsion gives it
without fail, because Scott’s
is always made of the finest
Cod Eiver Oil in the world,
made perfectly digestible
(and therefore far more
nourishing) by the original
Scott process of manufacture.
Stomach and bowel troubles
are cleared away and, better
still, the lime in Scott’s
brings the teeth out white,
straight and strong, and a
pleasure and pride to look at.
All this is only
true of Scott’s
and you will
have to make
sure “ the fish-
man with the
fish” is on the
package.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Sun-Dream.
Odor of grass new-mown,
And the swinging scythe-men shear
The plainland overgrown
With the ripeness of the year.
Shade, and the shine of the stream,
For the sun makes holiday ;
Oh he builds us pleasant weather
While the long rakes move together,
And through the shadows a shadowy dream
Floats to me over the hay.
Under the pines I lie,
Where the purple shadows creep
Through misty gloom to spy
About me as I sleep;
But I am far withdrawn
To the land of the southern dawn,
Where the sun swings low in the sky,
And soft winds laden deep]
With blossom and odor lie
On a plainland silver-grey,
With grasses mellow and sweet,
Till level and shining steep,
Rich with the splendor of day
Call to my swift-shod feet.
And the bronzen columns towering
To the sea-blue sea-deep sky,
And the yellow blossom flowering
Where ths rainbowed parrots fly.
And the blue-green leaves, where pierce
Strong sunshafts, glancing fierce—
Oh sun-dream overpowering,
I wake, and here am I!
HARRY SULLIVAN.
The Spinners.
(After Tristan Kling sor.)
I love the whirr of the spinning-wheels,
Where in the tapestried hall they stand,
And fingers twine ’mong the twining reels,
Weaving the roses of Fairyland.
I love the songs that the spinners sing
By the fitful gleam of the candle-light;
Fables of Love, and a victor-king,
Of loyal pages, and dame and knight.
Faded, fragile, and passing old,
The spinning-wheels, and the spinners, too ;
But quavering on, as the hours are told,
Their old-world ditties they croon to you.
“ This is the story of Pierre the page,
Who died for loving, and loved full well;
A rose from his lady was all his wage—
This is of Doris and Ysabelle ”
From lips o’erladen with songs like those
Come low notes, keyed to the haunting drone;
But, let in the shadows a door unclose,
And the singers are silent as carven stone.
For every spinner believes she hears
The lover she holds by a mystic spell,
Hastening to her across the years ;
A lordly lover, who loves her well.
She sees him kneeling low at her feet,
His kisses burn on her withered hand ;
And the flowers he brings her are sweet, ah sweet!
That wandering lover from Fairyland.
s.A.
A. M. BOWYER-ROSMAN.
Ancient Gods.
I hate the white Christ’s path of pain,
I love the honeyed sweets of sense,
I care not if my soul be slain,
Down are its ramparts of defence ;
Lust brings its own wild recompense.
This ritual of drabs and greys.
My halting tongue cannot commence,
Give me the Gods of Ancient Days.
I weary of the chiselled fane,
Where vestured priests dim altars cense.
Their rites, so delicate, are vain ;
They cannot win my penitence.
My shrine is all the world immense,
Lit by the great sun’s golden rays,
Joy’s liturgy its priests dispense ;
Give me the Gods of Ancient Days.
I wake, and only dreams remain.
Yenus has fled but whither and whence?
Bacchus has passed with all his train,
And from cool dells ’mid greenwood dense,
Dryad and Nymph have vanished hence ;
Yet since their shadows haunt my ways,
I cry from out this strife for pence—
Give me the Gods of Ancient Days.
N.S.W.
WILFRID MAILLER.
The Wind.
I float, I fade,
In dim, half-echoed harmonies
By silent stream and sleeping glade,
And printless mountain galleries ;
And forest-pools, so still, the trees
And bending fern and maiden-hair
Marvel to find their image there,
Half doubting that they are so fair.
I stoop, I swoon,
Where plumy rushes nod and quiver
Beside the noisy-winged lagoon.
I rout the pallid mists that hover
At dawn above the flowing river ;
Till in their flight they do let fall
Full many a pearly coronal,
To deck the waking buds withal.
But when the sky
Is cold and grey, and like a shroud
Lies the deep snow, then King am I!
And low the trees with fear are bowed
Before my song of triumph loud.
As witches chant their mystic rune,
Culling strange herbs beneath the moon,
When some infernal drug is brewn.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin tvould oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. 'To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved bu
the publishers.

THE LIARS.
A few years ago, when Federation was still in the
air, Sydney developed a loud and brazen herd of
liars, whose perjuries in the anti-Federal cause
were numerous and brassy and terrible. New
South Wales, outside Sydney, was mostly Federal
and Australian in spirit, but Sydney, dominated
by its importers and Calico Jimmies, mustered a
virulent anti-Australian contingent of the most
reckless description. It was against Austra-
lian union, against Australian industries, against
an Australian defence system; it believed
in importing governors, bishops, Railway Com-
missioners, and goods of all sorts; it was the
class which called things of Australian manu-
facture “colonial rubbish”; also it was, and
is, largely pro-nigger. This party commenced
lying in the anti-Federal interest very early, and
great and wonderful were its lies, its favorite
organ, the Sydney Telegraph, published a glaring
leading article to the effect that the Victorian
duty on coal (there was no such duty, so
the rag invented it) had ruined the N.S.W. coal
export to Victoria (as a matter of fact Victoria
was, and always had been, N.S. W.’s best customer
for coal), and the ’Geaph asked wildly if we
should combine politically with dreadful people
like that. There was a lie and a voice of warning
about how Auckland, the biggest and most
prosperous city in Maoriland, was a ruined place
with hay growing in its streets because of the
union of the provinces, and Sydney was warned,
if it federated, to look out for an accession of
green fresh grass in George-street and King-street.
There were frenzied lies about how the Bbaddon
Blot (which the N.S.W. Premier now demands
should be fixed permanently in the Constitu-
tion, because it isn’t a Blot but a blessing)
was a conspiracy to rob N.S.W. for the benefit of
the “needy States.” There were weird state-
ments about how N.S.W. would have to find the
money to keep the “needy States” out of
bankruptcy. There was a very frenzied liar
who informed the public that Ballarat had
already been selected (by parties unknown)
as the Australian capital. There were enter-
prising liars who declared that the Federal
movement was propped up in N.S.W. with
“Victorian gold,” and there were dazed liars
who said in the same breath that Victoria hadn’t
any money except what it borrowed from N.S.W.,
and there were.all manner of importers and liars!
* * * *
To-day the same old crowd is still at work, but
most of it puts on a new aspect. It is mad—very
mad —at the tariff which tries to encourage Aus-
tralian manufactures. It is wild about the
Commerce Act, which prohibits the importation
of brass or rolled gold marked “ 15-carat,”
and stuff called “ silk ” which is 50 per cent,
mineral loading and part of the other
50 per cent, shoddy. It is bitter about the
White Australia policy ; and above all, it is anti-
Australian by instinct, just as it always was. And
a great many of its members (being liars) pose as
individuals who were once ardent Federalists,
but who have been reluctantly converted to a
new view of things by the imaginary iniquities of
the Australian Government. And then, as a
rule, they proceed to enumerate the alleged
iniquities. One of the earliest items of the new
campaign of anti-Australian lying was the letter
of a member of the N.S.W. Upper House, who
wrote to the Sydney morning press, calling on
N.S.W. to secede, because the Australian Parlia-
ment had not kept its promise to supply Australia
with a uniform railway gauge. And the morning
press published his letter joyfully. It might , for
public information, have added a footnote to
the incredible lout’s communication, pointing
out that the Australian Parliament didn’t
own the railways, and had no control
over them whatever, and had never made,
and never could have made, the ridiculous
promise alleged, but the morning press carefully
abstained from doing anything of the sort. Then
there arose in the correspondence columns of
Sydney Telegraph a new crusade of anti-Federal
liars, who called down anathema on the head of
the Australian Government for annexing the sur-
plus, or a great part of the surplus, that should
have gone to N.S.W., and dividing it among the
other States. Every month, the financial column
of the Telegraph showed the careful return to
N.S.W. of every penny of its share of the surplus,
but that made no difference whatever to the anti-
Australian liars, and they went on their wild and
raving way till they had to leave off for lack of
adjectives.
•* * * *
Now, after a brief spell, the campaign of the
anti-Australian liars has resumed, and they have
produced many inventions. There was a liar—he
called himself “A Patriot”—who wrote to
Sydney Telegraph declaring that the Ma
State was wronged and conspired against be-
cause it had to pay more in proportion to its
population than the other States for the upkeep
of the Commonwealth and for Federal works. A
correspondent wrote, in reply, pointing out that
according to the N.S.W. Government statistics
N.S.W. paid lid. per head per annum less than
the average of the States. Then “A Patriot,”
being still a liar, stated that this only proved
“the neglect and lack of interest shown by the
Federal Ministry in the Mother State, as so much
less was spent in N.S.W.” And when it was
pointed out to “ A Patriot ” that he continued to
be a liar, for, according to the N.S.W. statistics,
it was not N.S.W. but Victoria which had the
smallest amount of Federal money, in proportion
to population, spent in its territory, this particular
liar simply dropped out of the controversy. He
didn’t apologise for his lies, but merely dropped
out and gave place to other equally squalid and
unmanly perverters. A person called Hodges
wrote in great haste to Sydney Evening News
stating that there was a clause in the Federal
Constitution which “ distinctly provided ” that
the Federal capital should be selected during
the term of the first Australian Parliament, and
this not having been done, the Parliament had
inflicted a great wrong on the Ma State, and the
Constitution was broken, and the Ma State was
no longer bound by it, and could, and ought to,
secede right away. Being asked to point out the
imaginary clause which set forth that the capital
must be selected by the first Parliament, this par-
ticular liar didn’t point it out, and didn’t with-
draw his lie ; he simply dropped the subject, like
the rest of the tribe of Ananias, and made way
for some fresh member of the gang.
• • * •
Amid all this confusion of anti-Australian liars
there arose W. E. Johnson, M.H.H., who said it
was solemnly agreed and provided that the
Federal capital should be “within a reasonable
distance of Sydney,” and who held that that
implied a capital somewhere near a line drawn
round Sydney at a distance of 100 miles from the
city. Johnson was asked to point out any clause
in the Constitution which even mentioned “a
reasonable distance from Sydney,” or which said
the capital should be on or near the 100-mile line.
He was even offered £2O if he would produce the
clause, but Johnson, M.H.R., departed from the
scene with his tail drooping in the dust, so it was
reasonably assumed that he was another un-
reliable anti-Australian slanderer who had been
bowled out. But when he left the scene of action
there arose violently an anti-Federal perverter
called H. H. B. Bradley, who supplied this sort
of silly bosh in Sydney Evening News :
Forty million sheep died in the drought, largely because
in order to bolster up the Victorian farmers and specula-
tors in chaff, there was so heavy a duty on chaff that it
was too expensive to buy to keep the sheep alive, so they
had to be left to die. I don’t mean to say that all the
sheep were killed in order that Victorian farmers might
get big prices for their produce, but a large proportion
of them were. Now, never mind the squatter or farmer
who had to suffer the first loss ; let us go to the pets of
the politicians—the masters of the Melbourne Govern-
ment—who did this mischief—the trades’ unionists—
-40,000,000 sheep less to be shorn, the loss in wages (if the
deficiency had only lasted two years) would have been
£1,000,000 less in wages spent among the shearers, rouse-
abouts, &c., and we have not even vet regained the
original number of sheep. This is only'one line affecting
the people, but the diminution in numbers means in-
creased cost of meat to the whole community. For this
and much more of the same sort, we have to thank the
politicians who betrayed us into our present position.
It was mentioned by someone, in reply to H. H.
B. Bradley, that the falling away in the number
of N.S.W. sheep began in 1892, nine years before
there was any Federation; that there was only
one year since the beginning of the Common-
wealth in which there was a decline in the
N.S.W. flocks, though there were seven years of
diminution before Federation ; that any alleged
loss of 40,000,000 sheep under Federation was a lie,
for the total reduction in the number of N.S.W.’
sheep in 1902—the solitary year of diminution
under Federal control—was only about 15,000,000 •
that of these the N.S.W. State Statistician rec-
koned the loss through climatic conditions at under
12,000,000, and these were set down as having died
through want of water—not through want of dry
chaff ; and that, seeing that N.S.W. imported
over 300,000 tons of dry hay and dry chaff (the
largest quantity on record) in 1902 to keep its
flocks alive, it was another lie to say that the
small duty prevented importation. It might
have been added that the usual gibe about a
“ Melbourne Government” was also something of
a lie seeing that the Government in question had
N.S.W.’s “noblest son” as Prime Minister,
and .the. N.S.W. element in it was much
stronger than that of any other State; and if
the remark about the flocks of the Ma State
not having yet recovered their “original num-
ber” meant that they haven’t got back to the
figure that they stood at immediately before
Federation, it is likewise wrong. Anyhow,
Bradley, being convicted of inventing gross and
unscrupulous statements with a view to sowing
dissension among the Australian people, evapo-
rated in a sort of way without withdrawing any
of his slanders and inventions.
* * * *
There were about a dozen assorted anti-Aus-
tralian and importing liars who were allowed to
shriek freely in the Sydney press at different
times about the iniquity of proposing to plant the
Australian capital on Monaro, so much nearer to
Melbourne than to Sydney. Sometimes it
was explained to them, and sometimes it
wasn’t, that Dalgetv was much nearer to Syd-
ney than to Melbourne, and that any good
map would reveal the fact, but none of the
liars made amends for their misstatements. In
fact they are still reciting the same old lie.
There was one Smith, of Dulwich Hill, Sydney,
who said that “five Federal capitals in Sydney
would not be equal to the tribute levied upon
N.S.W. by Victoria,” but Smith naturally didn’t
stop to show (because neither he nor anyone else
could show) where any N.S.W. revenue went to
Victoria. There was another Smith who wrote to
the Evening News to announce that “the only
thing that induced N.S.W. to join the Federation
was that the capital site should be in N.S.W. for
the benefit of this State, and not in this State for
the benefit of Victoria.” He was the same
delusion as the rest, seeing that N.S.W.
gave a majority for the first Constitution—
the one which left the Federal capital site an
open question—and it was only the fact that
the N.S.W. Legislature annulled that decision
by Act of Parliament which prevented the accept-
ance holding good. Quite a bag of liars wrote at
different times to declare that the Constitution
gave N.S.W. the sole power to select the site
of the Federal capital, and that selection by
any one else was a breach of faith and
an outrage. Occasionally some one took the
trouble to reply to a specially impudent and
virulent liar, and draw attention to that brief,
emphatic clause (No. 125) in the Constitution, in-
serted at the instance of George Reid of N.S.W.,
which says that “The Seat of Government of
the Commonwealth shall be determined by the
Parliament”-—“The Parliament” being defined
by Clause 1 as the Parliament of the Common-
wealth. Then that liar would generally retire
without apology er explanation, and in a few days
a fresh Ananias would come forward and dump
down the old perjury as freshly as ever.
* * * *
Even this doesn’t nearly exhaust the category
of the parochial, Foreign-trade, anti-Federal,
anti-Australian lies. A cheerless person, calling
himself “Australian,” wrote lately to the S.M.
Herald to describe the unfitness of the Dalgety
district, especially as compared with Yass, to be
the Australian capital, because of its utter sterility,
its bitterly cold climate, and the enormous and
incredible cost of making a railway into
the district. Some one wrote, drawing
the misnamed person’s attention to the fact
that the Carruthers Government had promised
to make the railway in any case, because
of the splendid fertility of the land thereabouts,
and that the difference in temperature between
Dalgety and Yass was almost imperceptible.
“ Australian ” didn’t express any regret for his
lies ; he just ceased corresponding. The same
attitude was taken up by the numerous liars who
alleged that the selection of Monaro as a capital
site was a Victorian conspiracy, and who had it
pointed out to them that the selection was made
on N.S.W.’s special and official recommendation.
None of them apologised. Joseph Carruthers,
whom N.S.W., for its sins, has acquired for its
principal State Insect, has recently discovered
another baseless woe. He says : “It was never
intended that the Federal Government should get
control of the Customs duties ’’—this despite the
fact that it was the old Reid-Carruthers Govern-
ment of N.S.W. which insisted on the Braddon
clause being made removable in 1910, so that,
after that date, the Federal Government might
get complete control of the Customs duties.
And, by way of a shriek of pure humor
amid many things that are partly humor-
ous and partly tragic, a joyous clown
lately joined in the clamor, and wrote to the S.M.
Herald to complain because the Melbourne Cup
is a more famous race than any horsey event held
in N.S.W., and he mixed up this grievance with
the Federal capital question till a dizzy feeling
began to supervene in the reader’s head, and the
said reader went to look up the letter “ H ” in the
index to the Australian Constitution to see if he
could find anything there about “horse.”
• * * *
Then, apart from these tangible lies which can
be refuted, there is always the impalpable and
intangible lie and grumble and sneer and in-
uendo about “Victorian domination” and “the
iron heel of Victoria ’’—the sort of Foreign-trade
curse and grumble which started 40 years back, in
the gold days, when Melbourne temporarily
overshadowed Sydney, and by so doing roused
the Cabbage-Tree Mob to fury. This, how-
ever, is a small matter, and it has been going
on as long as the present generation can
remember, and has nearly lost its influence.
But the wholesale lying, which consists in assur-
ing the people that imaginary clauses in the Con-
stitution have been broken, that solemn and
imaginary obligations have been violated, and
that imaginary conspiracies against the Ma State
have come to light, may do something to create a
temporary and deluded frenzy. Titus Oates was
no more unscrupulous, and no more plausible a
liar than the anti-Australians whom the S.M.
Herald, and the Telegraph, and the Evening
News and often the Star aid and abet,
by giving space to their glaring inventions,
and Oates carried a whole nation off its
feet before it realised how it had been
deceiyed. The crowd of enormous liars who, by
their imaginary grievances, dragged Britain into
the Boer war, in order that they might get cheaper
colored labor for their mines, furnished another case
in point. So did that crowd of scandal-mongers,
on whose reports the mob of London, more
than sixty years ago, used to jeer at
the young Queen Victoria as “ Melbourne’s
mistress.” There is no popular delusion so
monstrous that the people may not believe it for
a while —whether it be anti-Australianism, or
witchcraft, or the damnation of unbaptised infants
—if it is backed up by a sufficient number of
sufficiently persistent liars.
* * * «
In a sense, of course, the push of Foreign-
trade, anti-Federal, anti-Australian liars stands
convicted. There is a High Court which
can nullify any law or any Federal action
which is contrary to the Constitution. It isn’t
“ dominated by Victorians ” —out of its five judges
the chief is a Queenslander, and two others are
from N.S.W. It isn’t a Melbourne institution;
it sits in each capital. No one has dared to say
that it has been “ bought by Victorian gold,” and
that it is venal or untrustworthy. If one single
liar among all the anti-Australians who rave
about alleged breaches of the Constitution could
point to a breach that would stand a moment’s
inspection he would, it may safely be assumed,
go to the High Court, and knock the Aus-
tralian Government out with great joy, or Car-
ruthers’ Attorney-General would do it for him.
If even one dreadful specimen among all therav
who croak about the breaches of the Constit
tion that are going to happen if the Australia
Parliament does this or that, believed in a shra
of his own story, he would beseech his friends t
keep quiet, and to let the Australian Parliampra
do the foolish deed, and he would then m it
action annulled in the High Court, and thus cove
his enemy with mud and confusion. Among a rj
the anti-Australian correspondents who are read
to swear, and do swear profusely, that the Art
fixing the capital at Dalgety is ultra vires, becaus 1
no capital can be fixed without the consent of th 6
N.B.W. State Legislature; and that such *
locality is contrary to the Constitution in ant
case on account of the 100-miles limit; and that
the demand for 900 square miles is quite illegal
and all the rest of the familiar folly—among then!
all not one offers to put up a copper in order t
get their Honors Griffith, Barton, O’Connor
and co. to annul the Act. And amid all
the chaos of correspondents and other liars
who allege that N.S.W. is being robbed by the
other States of its fair share of the cash, no one
even proposes to lay the figures before the High
Court and get the robbery stopped. Presum
ably, if even a solitary Munschacsen in the
multitude believed in his own fable that
Munschausen would move in the matter, orsug.
gest a movement. It is a pity that amid so many
liars there should be no sign of even one liar who
has any faith in his own anti-Australian lie
That sort of thing makes the venomous crowd of
insects look ridiculous.
SEEING THE LIGHT.
We are much mistaken if the fruit-growers felt anv
elation over hints of ihe coming taiilr. Competitive
duties will no more assist the fruu-grower than the
pastoralist, or the wheat-grower.— Sydney Telegraph.
On this text “Leonardo” speaks apiece:—
The D.T. is right. The fruit-grower won’t feel anv
elation ; in fact, he won’t feel anything ; his hard lot
has made him impervious. I know ! I was born and bred
in the centre of the Cumberland fruit-growing district
and I saw my father lay down his lioe, as did hundreds
of others, at nearly the same hour, six days in the week
and, wiping the dust from his specs., swallow mentally
every word of the Freetrade trash ladled out to him by
the same old paper which took such mighty good care
to get Protection for itself.
The Telegraph is the recognised fruitgrower’s paper.
It got hold of him because he was so rushed to make a
living against impos ted fruit—both green and preserved-
that he didn’t have time to think.
* * • *
I mentioned Protection to my schoolmaster once at the
age of 13, and he looked at me very seriously for a time •
then, running his Freetrade hands over my head, he said’
wearily, “ Oh, my boy, I am afraid yon will never do
much for yourself.” Well, he hasn’t done much for him-
self. He is still there after 18 years, and still deploring
the ignorance of the fruitgrower’s child.
I mentioned Protection, for the second time, to my
father at the age of 18. He looked at me over his spec-
tacles, and, unfolding the Telegraph, said, “Are you
mad? Read that, and then see if you want Protection.”
That was IT to the fruit-grower. He read nothing else
he saw nothing else, and believed nothing else. '
But this is what I read from the newspaper of life.
I saw myself at the age of 14 with sufficient education
to carry me through a third form examination, two pairs
of cheap boots a year, one suit of slop-made clothes, and
about £2 a year pocket money. I saw all my schoolmates
in the same plight, only many worse. And I began to
think : “ If this Freetrade is such a grand thing fur the
fruit-grower, why is it that the fruit-grower’s child is
not dressed in smart clothes, like the boys I saw coming
out of the big importing houses in Sydney.” We worked
harder. I knew from experience that no'rnan, woman, or
child could work harder. And I puzzled over this con-
dition of things till my brain was nearly bursting, and
then one day I “ saw the light,” as our country parson
would say.
• * « •
It was in the Sydney fruit market. My father had
taken in a load of lemons. I remember w'ell the pride my
mother took in them, and how we all worked like tigers
from six in the morning till dark picking and polishing
them, and how my father and myself snatched a few
hours’ sleep before journeying into town so as to be in
time to get a good “stand.” I can see the stream of
buyers pouring into the markets. I can see the ex-
pectant look on my father’s face as he watched them, and
wiped an imaginary speck from the fresh, yellow fruit.
But buyers didn’t come to us. It was the time of the
year, too, when the fruit should have been in keen
demand. I can see the anxiety of my father, as he left
me in temporary charge of our little lot and joined a
crush of buyers who were assembled round a stack of
cases whose gaudy outside lettering was to me un-
familiar. When he came back he just said two words,
“ Italian lemons,” and then I knew whv we had to cart
half the load home again, and why I dfdn’t get the new
pair of boots I had been promised.
On the way home I said, “ Why don’t we stop these
foreigners sending their lemons here, dad ? ” He turned
on me angrily and snapped out, “ We can’t stop them.”
• • • *
And then one day I found out that Protection could stop
them. And whenever I met a man who knew anything
of commerce and trade, about which I, with thousands of
other fruitgrowers, was ignorant, I plied him with ques-
tions, and found out that we sold our grapes for some-
thing like Is. per box of 241 b. because we couldn’t make
them into wines and brandies, owing to this champion
Protection having his hands tied. We couldn’t dry our
apples, or tin our peaches, or grow our raisins, because
California could send them thousands of miles and sell
them cheaper, and we couldn’t compete against them in
quality because we bought inferior foreign bone dust
and artificial manures.
Also, I found out that all the diseases and pests that
destroyed half our crops each year had been introduced
into our country through the importation of foreign
fruits. Also, I found out that nearly everything we
bought came from England or America or Germany.
* * * *
I remember we were gathering peaches one day, and
my father was grumbling about the poor demand; and
being struck with what f thought was a brilliant idea, I
said : “ Dad, if we had all the men here who make the
things we buy, there would be plenty of people to eat our
fruit.” And he roared at me over his basket, “ They’d
starve. Didn’t you read what the Telegraph said?”
Poor old Dad ! He is still on his orchard. He is still a
Freetrader. He still reads the Telegraph. He is still
poor.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Hat and Some Reflections.
Sydney, the home and centre of that bastard
Freetrade which passes, in N.S. Wales for the
real Cobden article, is also, naturally, the
home of anti-Australian sentiment in its worst
form. It is the only place of any im-
portance in Australia where a large section
of the population will, without an attempt
at inspection, denounce any Australian-manu-
factured article as rubbish simply because it is
Australian. It is the only place where a large
part of the community will promptly change its
mind about an article which it regarded as good
so long as it thought the thing was imported, and
on learning that the thing wasn’t imported will
assume that it must be bad, despite its apparent
goodness. It is the only place left in this con-
tinent where herds of arrogant and unpatriotic
vulgarians have the snarl colonial rubbish” still
in their mouths. And it is in the Sydney
morning papers that the neighboring State of
Victoria is utterly accursed, firstly because it
is part of Australia and isn’t imported, and
secondly (also chiefly) because it has tried to
do something for the promotion of Australian
industries, instead of advocating the importation


ssfj t&sttisrivs;
I’te same thing can be

Svdney, tnd there is no record of any community

K good for the wide world that there isn t. In
•HLe arrogant hatred of its own country, and
! c virulent slanders of its own country s m-
ifnstries, the commercial section-not the work-
ing-class section —of Sydney is unique. The Bul-
1n has said this often, as new examples of the
moorting craze came under its notice, and it is
Ted to say it again by another incident which
telv chanced to come in the way of a Bulletin
S It was in a Sydney hat shop. A supe-
,Vr Sydney commercial person was exam inmg a
I f ile was quite satisfied with it, and the deal
was apparently about to be completed, when the
lopman rushed in where angels fear to tread
with the information that the article was Austra-
l in-made. The prospective buyer was grieved
hpvond words. He said nothing—there was
nothing he could say that would fully express the
iniouity of a hat not being imported ; he just put
the unclean thing on the counter and left. Not
nnlv did he not want that hat; he also wanted no
other hat out of that shop. A place that
would keep hats that were made in Australia
was not to be trusted. He didn’t explain Ins
attitude, and there was no need ; his natural
conmercial-Sydney attitude as a consistent
olrector to Australian manufactures spoke
for itself. When that kind of man is
reproached for his unpatriotic attitude, he takes
refuge in the handy lie that he doesn’t object to
Australian goods because they are Australian,
but because of their inferior quality. The lie is
almost too glaring to be worth refutation. In
many lines Australian goods are of the very best
quality, but because of people like those who
make up the Sydney commercial class, they have
to be sold as foreign, or they wouldn’t sell at all.
Only the cheaper varieties which are bought by
the working classes can be sold as Australian the
Sydney workman not having that inane hatred of
Australia which marks the Sydney bagman ;
therefore the name of Australia has become com-
pulsorily associated with the commoner varieties of
goods. Some day, when the Labor party acquires
a fiscal faith of its own and adopts an Australian
national policy, it may do something to suppress
this long-standing disease. No other organisation
is sufficiently solid and extensive to do much. There
is at least a partial remedy to be found. When a
notorious Anti-Australian and Foreign-trader
is at the head of a banking business, it will
be a perfectly fair proceeding for the central
executive of the Australian National Party
to ukase that everybody connected with the
party shall refuse to touch the notes of
his bank; a man who shudders at the pro-
ducts of Australian industry can only expect
other peopl e to shudder at his banknote printed
and issued in Australia. The insurance man who
lives up to the creed that Australian clothes are
necessarily rubbish, will only be taken at his
word if all patriotic people refuse to touch the
Australian insurance he sells, lest it be also
rubbish. The Australian-made houses of the
landlord who is a virulent anti-Australian can be
avoided, and no one is bound to buy three-
penn’orth of Sunday preaching from the Foreign-
tiade preacher; cheap imported sermonscanalways
be purchased and read at home. And it somehow
seems sheer foolishness to patronise the doctor
who lives up to the theory that nothing Australian
is of any value—he may have got the idea by
considering his own uselessness as an Australian
physician ; and the lawyer whose furniture is all
imported may have acquired his impression that
Australian furniture is of no value because he
knows that his own Australian law is about the
poorest article in the market. A time will
probably come when an Australian National
Party will give all these people the injury of the
doubt, and it is difficult to see what they can have
to complain of when it does come.

“Rome” Again.
The other day the allegedly Reverend Olaek,
founder of the Victorian Protestant Defence
League, transferred the blight and ornament of
himself from Victoria to N.S.W. The dreary
inhabitants of his Cave of Adullam gave him a
send-off, and this was part of the way in which
they slopped over :
Parson Carey said that “ priests were accumulating; in
this city, and true Protestants, if they valued their liber-
ties, must not allow themselves to be lulled into a sense
of false security.”
Parson Burns said that “ there was still a danger of
their liberties slipping away, and the troubles and tribu-
lations of former days returning.”
, Mr. 0. B. Snowball, “ on behalf of the Orange Institu-
tion, expressed regret at the loss the cause was sustaining
by Mr. Clark’s departure. The ltoman Church was
advancing rapidly, and it was no use trying to shut one’s
eyes to that fact. Earnest workers were everywhere
wanted.”
Mr. A. G. Bamsay “ considered that Protestants to-day
were sitting down and allowing the other side to quietly
push them out of the ruling position. Eoman Catholics
were being driven away from other countries and flocking
into the British Empire, where they were allowed more
freedom than anywhere else. He believed in tolerance,
hut they must all keep their eyes open.”
Mr. Clark, responding, said he “hoped that the old
spirit of readiness to draw the sword in defence of their
liberties would never die among Protestants.”
And again the weary old question arises, “ What
do these vociferous persons propose to do?”
lhey talk a vast lot, and a good deal of the talk
is very unreliable; N.S.W., for instance, still
remembers the time when their clatter about the
way the Public Service was overrun by Holy
Romans drove an excited Government into taking
a religious census of the service, with the result
that it proved that the number of R.O.’s, Metho-
dists, Baptists, Jews, &c., was much below what
might have been fairly expected, considering the
proportion of the population that belongs to these
sects, and that Dill Macky’s Presbyterians had
so much more than their reasonable share of the
]obs, if the matter were viewed on a purely insec-
tarian basis, that they threatened to elbow every-
body out. Of course, there is something in all
this loose conversation; a whole lot of pious men
make good money out of the clamor, and some
run profitable and clamorous little papers on the
strength of it, and some get into Parliament on
account of it, and all get advertisement. But,
with it all, what do they propose to
DO to discourage “ Rome ” ? Their papers
don’t convert any one, for Roman Catholics
don’t read them. Their meetings convert nobody,
for Roman Catholics don’t go to them. Appa-
rently the Clakks and SNOWBALLsdon’t propose to
close up Roman Catholic churches, schools, colleges,
hospitals, or orphanages, or to prevent new ones
bei ng built; they don’t propose to disfranchise
Catholics, or to shut them out of Parliament or
the Civil Service, or to charge them extra tram
and train fares, or to assault them, or to dis-
qualify them for anything, or to poll-tax them, or
to prevent R.C. immigrants landing. They don t,
it would seem, profess to do anything except talk,
and converse, and cuss, and discuss, ana hold
forth, and be voluminous, and draw their salaries
and profits, and wear their regalia, and advertise
themselves. The things above mentioned, and the
other things that could be devised to discourage
“Rome” in our midst, might be wicked and
intolerant and brutal; but if the Protestant
Defence push, and the Orange push, and the rest
tried to carry any of them they would at least be
attempting something. There would be some
reason for their existence, and they would be
something* more than a purposeless
gas-baggy weariness, and an inflated bladder
that bounds up and down on the same
spot, and progresses not at all. Any kind of
action or proposed action would be a relief from
the roar of dialogue. As it is, Brother Snowball
and his kind might as well be speaking disrespect-
fully of the equator, or denouncing the rings of
Saturn. Certainly they get some men into
Parliament, but these men do nothing to damage
“ Rome ” when they arrive there. All they do is to
vote for Freetrade, and for the destruction of Aus-
tralian industries (mostly run by Protestants), and
for the free importation of goods from Roman
Catholic countries. And these things don’t seem
to have any bearing on “Rome.” Is it not
possible for the Clarks and Snowballs to realise
that even active dog-stealing, or any other kind of
purposeful motion, would make the average
citizen feel better than this gassy futility ?
The Limited Anarchist.
Candidate J. H. Maddock, who is seeking to
enter the Victorian House of Rich Landlords for
the province of Melbourne North, propounded
the other day this alleged axiom: “It is not
necessary to legislate about everything.” Mad-
dock, who belongs to a tirm of “established
family solicitors, appears, from a study of his
speech, to be a Tory of a less appalling character
than most of the members of the House of Land-
lords ; but his declaration shows him to be suffer-
ing from the anarchistic mania which afflicts
Tories all over the world. They hate the Law
with a hatred much more bitter and deadly
than that of the Yarrabankers, whose ravings
are, after all, mere looneyism; while Tory
Anarchy is a brutal proclamation of the
right of the strong to prey upon the necessities of
the weak. “Down with the tyranny of law!’
they and Yarra bank shout together ; and the
roar of Yarra bank is not distinguishable from the
scream of Collins-street and the shout of Flinders-
lane The first wail against legislation was that
which was raised by the large buck nigger with a
heavy club, when the tribe forbade him to strike
upon the head the small nigger who was suffering
from kidney disease, and therefore could not run
away. The rights of murder and open theft were
taken away from these Tories of ancient times,
and unlimited Anarchy became a hopeless ideal.
To-day the Tories moan mournfully that at least
their Limited Anarchy should be left to them.
The “unnecessary legislation,” against which
they have protested in very modern times, has in-
cluded laws which forbade the sweating of women
and children, the poisoning of the people by
impure foods, the piracy of trusts and mono-
polies, the swindling of customers by trades-
men the theft of a tenant’s income, and
a million other forms of manslaughter and
robbery. In howling that “ it is unnecessary to
legislate,” the Tory is contradicting the experi-
ence of every human society, from an infant-
school cricket club to the Ber-ritish Empire.
Moreover (if this is of any importance), he is
adopting a most unholy and irreligious attitude,
His parsons declare to him, day after day, that
the whole of Goo’s universe is governed by Law.
But the Tory refuses to believe that he was made
in the image of God. And perhaps he is right.
o
The “ Herald ” is Shocked.
What a magnificent old humbug our S. M.
Herald is ! But these two things side by side: 1
Exhibit A.
The main planks of the Government platform are
clearly laid down in a proposed remission of taxation to
the tune of nearly three-quarters of a million. It has
been seen everywhere that the piling up of surpluses
could not continue. In the three years ending the com-
ing June we shall And the Treasury with upwards of two
and aquarter millions in excess of expenditure require-
ments, and the current financial year alone promises to
close with a surplus of £1,350,000. To meet a manifest
necessitv, therefore, Mr. Oarruthers proposes to give up
altogether that part of the income-tax derived from
earnings by personal exertion. —S.M. Herald, May 10.
New South Wales already has several manifest advan-
tages over the other States. Bet us not create a dis-
advantage (bv substituting a dividend-tax for an income-
tax). This should especially apply, seeing that the money
is not needed.—S.M. Herald, May 13.
Exhibit B.
Maoriland has added £20,000,000 to her national debt
since the accession of Mr. Ballance to power, and this
money has got to be paid in the long run, whilst in the
interval interest mounts up to a huge sum every year.
In the circumstances there can be no such thing as a
surplus, properly considered, for every penny that over-
taxed citizens pay into the public treasury is owing to
the public creditor. —S.M. Herald, May 16.
The S.M. Herald believes in honesty and all that
sort of thing, as far away as Maoriland is. Wben
the honesty has to be practised at home, it is a
different sort of caterpillar. Maoriland, having
added £20,000,000 to its public debt in 17 years,
can’t have such a thing as a surplus, and any
remission of taxation would be plain roguery—
“ every penny is owing to the public creditor.
But in H.S. Wales, which has added £37,258,401
to the public debt in the same 17 years, surpluses
are quite real; only, as “the money is not
needed,” thev ought to be abolished promptly.
Each State 'is up to its long ears in debt;
and, looking at the matter as a disinterested
outsider, the S.M. Herald, with an eye on
the £20,000,000 of new debt, tells Maoriland
that when the Rickety Islands talk about
surpluses they talk rubbish—there aren’t any such
things as surpluses while the State is in pawn.
But when it is the S.M. Herald and the S.M.
Herald’s fat importers who have to provide the
surpluses, when there are any, then N.S. Wales’
£37,258,401 of new debt is a small matter that can
be put into the coal-bin and forgotten. So it all
depends on who has to be honest. When one
thinks over it all, one sees how good Providence
is to a highly respectable paper like the Herald ;
it provides that virtuous organ with places like
Maoriland, so that it need not go back on the
pious, copybook principles of its founder, but may
go on using its opportunities to press home the
great truth that honesty is the best policy. If
Providence were less kind and didn’t send places
like Maoriland the S.M. Herald, for the sake of
example, might have to be honest itself.

A Stipendiary Grumbler and Inspector of
Fantods.
The N.S.W. Government proposes to raise at the
next inter-State Conference
The question of appointment, at joint expense of all
States, of some competent person to examine Common-
wealth measures introduced, with a view to ascertaining
whether State rights are affected thereby.
In other words, the Government of the Ma State
wants to Eederalise the expense of its Mrs.
Gummidge policy of wail and grumble. Its
main contention is that it is a distressed Ma
State robbed by all the other States, and
it wants them to put up a share of the
money so that it may find new grievances.
But the wildest humor of the situation is that
the “ competent person ” required already exists—
five of him—and instead of being merely an insti-
tution with power to grumble and snarl it is a
body with power to do things, and to do them
with an axe. Whenever the Australian Par-lia-
inent passes an Act which encroaches on State
Rights, the High Court has power to abolish it,
and is bound to do so on application The only
reason why Carruthers has never applied is that,
despite all his complaints about the allegedly
unconstitutional doings of the Commonwealth,
he knows perfectly well that he has never had a
case that he dare produce in court. And the
reason why he wants for the future to rely on a
“competent” Hired Grumbler and Inspector of
Fantods, instead of on the High Court, is that he
knows his future bogey is likely to be the same
jim-jam as his past fantod.
Victoria’s Disreputable Employer.
At last there seems some hope of the big blot—
the Irvine Blot—on Victorian Factories legislation
being removed. A deputation has elicited from
Alexander Peacock a promise to insist in Cabinet
and in Parliament on the repeal of section 14 of
the Factories Act—the section known as “the
reputable employer ” clause. Under this section
Wages Boards are required to fix as the minimum
wage in any trade a rate not exceeding the average
wage paid by “reputable employers” in that
trade. This idea was introduced by the Irvine
Government in 1903, and was bitterly opposed
from both sides of the House. But Irvine carried
his point with a specious promise and a few
Hansard pages of legal jargon. He put into
the section a sub-clause, giving the Boards power
to report to the Minister when they were unable
to determine who were reputable employers, and
requiring the Minister to then refer the whole
case to a court of appeal, which was expected to
regard it quite apart from the allegedly re-
putable em ployer. This compromise was accepted
by the House, and Trenwith and Peacock,
the two bitterest opponents of the clause, drew
in their horns to some extent. The clause became
law, and, like everything else put in the statute
book by Iceberg Irvine, it has been a failure.
A Wages Board consists of equal numbers of em-
ployees and employers, with a chairman—generally
a police magistrate. The chairman is seldom
without a bias, and the bias is always towards
employers. As a consequence he is generally
willing—and the decisions are always his deci-
sions, for he has the deciding vote —to believe that
the greatest sweater in the land is a reputable
employer, and one chairman went so far as to
declare that he considered every employer reput-
able until he was fined for sweating, though how he
could be fined for sweating when the law held
that because of his blessed reputableness nothing
he did was sweating, it is hard to say. Con-
sequently the wages fixed by Boards since the
new Act was passed have never exceeded the
average wage in the trade. Hardly ever has a
Board been found that would refer the oase to the
Minister, because the chairman and the employers’
representative are a majority. A few weeks ago
the starch case was so referred, but there it was
not a question of a living wage, or of the rights
of the employees; it was merely the dislike of a
sagacious septuagenarian, like Keogh, P.M., to
offend big people by branding them as disre-
putable. But, supposing Boards did act on the
clause and report to the Minister, a most illogical
state of things is created. The decision on the
question of wages is taken out of the hands of the
Wages Board, specially created for the pur-
pose, and handed over to a court of appeal—
to a single judge, who is usually blinded by
class prejudice, and who has no knowledge
of any wages question apart from his idea of the
wages that should be paid to a member of the
Barristers’ Trades Union, of which Bruce Smith
and Purves are loud and persistent members.
One such Judge has already ignored the eight
hours principle so far as to fix hours in one trade
at 52 per week. The only possible remedy is to
throw the last remnant of Irvine’s legislation on
the scrap-heap, and to forget that there was ever
such a person as the wretched Iceberg.
The Commerce Act Begins to Talk.
By the grace of Bill Lyne and other good Aus-
tralians who passed the Commerce Act, it looks
as though the person who buys imported goods
may one day be almost sure of getting what he
asks and pays for. The recent discovery of a
quantity of “silk” loaded with 50 per cent, of
mineral matter, has so stirred the Customs authori-
ties that they are investigating a lot more than
they used to, and a lot more than is good for the
importer’s health. Firstly, they have discovered
that such an enormous quantity of the silk im-
ported is loaded with foreign matter that to con-
fiscate and destroy it would mean that practically
no silk would enter the country for months.
There would be nothing to weep over
in this catastrophe, but the acting-Minister
is afraid that to do this sort of thing “would
seriously dislocate trade.” The importer is, how-
ever, to be required to label his precious mineral
silk truthfully in future. Also analyst Percy
Wilkinson is to get his acids and his microscope
to bear on sundry samples of imported cloths,
cal\::os, cottons, flannels, flannelettes, cashmeres,
etc., and if they should accidentally happen to
be also large' mineral, not only will the present
lots have to m ■. .led to that effect, but steps will
be taken to con.-scate and destroy the fraudu-
lent mullock in future. Also the Controller-
General latel .otified that to label imported
white lead adulterated with 25 per cent, of
barium as “ ground white lead, reduced,
wasn’t good enough; in future the percentage
of adulterant will have to be clearly and perma-
nently shown on the coverings of the goods. Also
the department, having lately discovered that
certain brooches, marked 9-carat, contained no
carat of gold whatever, has intimated that, for the
future, articles of that description must be labelled
“ Imitation Jewellery ” in legible and prominent
characters. Altogether, the way of the importer
promises to grow ever more rocky and difficult
which is a soothing circumstance, for, coincidently
with that, the path of the Australian manufacturer
grows smoother and easier.
The N.S.W. Income Tax.
Joseph Carruthers, who has just joined forces
with G. Reid, and promised that in future they
will slander Australia and misrepresent N.o.
Wales together, signalises the union by undoing
practically the only bit of work that remained as
a souvenir of G. Reid’s long tenure of power m
the State. The necessity of direct taxation was
the plank on which G. Reid won and held office,
and he passed a Land and Income Taxes Act which
was certainly of some value. Now, just when the
Land Tax is shown clearly to be not high enough
to restrain land monopoly, it is not raised
but practically abolished as a State tax, and con-
verted into & local rate ; and on top of this it is
proposed to do away with the impost on incomes.
This last is the price which Carruthers pays for
the Lands Scandals. It is necessary to do some-
thing to placate the section of the Deform irarty
which takes a purely selfish view of politics, and
will support any leader who offers it a bribe in the
way of a remission of taxation. The income-tax
is the sop. Yet no one can allege that in N.S.
Wales the income-tax is either oppressive or in-
quisitorial. Exempting incomes under £2OO, and
levying a modest 6d. in the £ afterwards, it makes
no very heavy demand even on the rich. An in-
come of £lOOO a year (which is a fairly large one
for Australia) pays only £2O a year. And the
collection of the tax involves few of the objec-
tionable features of the much higher British tax.
In England your word isn’t taken as to your in-
come. The Inland Revenue Department cal-
culates what it ought to be from the style you are
living in, or the sort of business you are doing,
and assesses accordingly. In N.S. Wales, either
because taxpayers are more honest, or the Gov-
ernment more complaisant, the administration
of the income-tax seems to cause little or
no annoyance. Carruthers is thus deliber-
ately throwing away a source of income
which involves no hardship to anyone and
causes but little grumbling—far less than most
taxation ; which provides the best of machinery
for a quick increase of taxation, if ever a national
crisis makes that necessary; and which is cer-
tainly not superfluous, seeing that the State is
borrowing to the extent of £1,300,000 a year. If
N.S.W. had ceased to borrow, and were repaying
the foreign money-lender at that rate, whilst also
carrying out a liberal public works policy, there
would be some excuse for this remission of taxa-
tion. As it is, it is just a politically dishonest
electioneering expedient forced on Carruthers
as a sort of compensation for the scandals of his
regime.
Thus William Henry Spank, from Victoria
I am fairly mild at most times, but when people like
Jambs Pannikin, Esq., talk, as in B. 25/4/’O7, I shed the
garment of affability. As he says, in one of those frac-
tional truths which he complains of, teachers are not
compelled to do anything outside the programme ; they
are only invited to do so. Just that. In the “ ex J
Teachers’ Gazette appears a par. to the effect
that “ while a number of teachers did such and
such, in accordance with a suggestion from this
office we regret to notice that a large percentage
overlooked it. This argues a lack of interest in the work
of the department,” etc. Then the inspector asks regard-
ing those things, and says: “Oh 1 no. You were not
compelled to do it; but it was not much out of your
way!” And he notes in his report that while the school
work is satisfactory, the teacher evidently lacks that en-
thusiasm necessary to the successful educator. Next
time, there is the damaging remark that methods criti-
cised at last visit are still in use, or the teacher does
not use methods at his disposal to the best advantage.
There is no compulsion attempted, but you notice other
men passing over your head if you get these reports.
“ Why shouldn’t a teacher make his school premises in-
to a nursery, experimental plot and academy of wonders.
asks Mr. Inspector Pannikin. It s a long answer. The
teacher has to prepare his day’s work—about three hours
toil if properly done —before school, has exercise books to
correct at dinner-time, and up to an hour s clerical work
after school. His meals, his rest,, his study, and
all the miscellaneous work that he is invited (not
" compelled ”) to do, come out of the remainder of the
Kids.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s Lawson writing verses on the men who
might have been;
O’ Dowd attacks the ranks of greed and pelf;
While Dyson weaves romance about the mine and
the machine,
And Hervey’s penning poems on himself.
To Quinn the psychological a motive e’er
provides;
For fame in Bible ballads Bedford bids ;
McCrae is busy rhyming of the winds and stars
and tides —
But the burden of my little song is—Kids.
Australia wants a lot of things to make her go
ahead;
And lots of other things she ought to lose;
She should hit the small State-righters till they’re
safely cold and dead,
And pay off what she’s borrowed from the Jews.
When thoughts and things that come from some-
where else are safe forgot,
And her shores of Stinking Fishermen she rids,
She can start acquiring wisdom that’s developed
on the spot;
But, meanwhile, what she wants the most is Kids.
She wants to run her own affairs by people of her
own ;
She wants a fleet that isn’t made of tin ;
She wants a band of workers who can eat the
things she’s grown,
And some public men who’ll cease to wag their
chin;
She wants some irrigation, too ; but better still
than they,
And better far than millions from the Yids,
Can be gathered for the asking, if she’s only game
to pay
For a nation’s cheapest, finest asset—Kids.
So to her heart Australia ought to cuddle every
one,
And ask no foolish questions how they came ;
For, when Nippon reaches South, we’ll all be
grateful for the gun
Of the lad who doesn’t know his father’s name.
We’ll be mighty glad to mate him with the girl
who, years ago,
Arrived by paths that Piety forbids,
Or we should be —so it’s up to us to let Australia
. know
That her best and proudest boast should be her
Kids.
With a million pudgy infants on her stretchers
squalling loud,
Australia would be better off by far
Than if all the noble sentiments by statesmen
bland avowed
Were quite as true as people think they are,
Or if a thousand ten-inch guns were scattered
round her coast,
Or the heavens sent a ten-inch rain of quids—
For, of all the things Australia wants, the one she’s
wanting most —
And the one she’s really got to get—is Kids.

day—recreation he should never need. If he goes a holi-
day trip, it is to visit other pedagogues and talk “shop.”
Inspector will tell you: “See Dicks in the holidays.
Hes very good on so-and-so,” and will ask you next
visit, “ Did you see Dicks, as I suggested?”
The first sentence in our report says : “There is (or is
not) a school garden ” (remarks follow as to condition)
and a library ” (or not, and more remarks). Under the
heading of “ Buildings,” it is said that “ There are some
pictures exhibited on the walls, but they are poor in
quality and unframed.” For all these things and
apparatus the teacher has to find the money. He needn’t
pay it out of his own pocket—that is not expected.
He can “get up concerts” (himself training the kids
ungodly hours for months to the detriment of his health
and temper, their school work, and their parents’
cows), “hold gymnastic displays” (the average peda-
gogue isn’t fit to strip in a bath, let alone a
public hall), and “work up local enthusiasm”
(in most agricultural districts there isn’t any to work
up). This enthusiasm is a departmental phrase.
It means that you are to “get on the right side ” of Jones
to plough the garden, Brown for loads of manure,
Robinson for practical help and advice, Wilkins for posts,
Johnson for netting, Mullins and Cootes and Mugsby
for labor, Mr. Merino for plants, shrubs, and voung
trees, and the junior Cowspankers to look after the
garden holiday times, and give it a drop of water on
Sundays while the teacher scrapes a little popularity by
playing the organ at church, 10 miles awav, &c. There’s
no cadging. Teachers are requested not to ask for
money. But they have to crawl to all these people, and
then the department says : “ Mr. Hyphen, at Numeral
receives much valuable help from the local people, and
expects that the children take more interest, and benefit
much thereby.” This is in a man’s school—what about a

Queensland has held its State elections, and is
left with three fairly well-balanced parties. Pre-
mier Kidston, who stands, or has stood so far,
for progress and solvency, has some 24 assured
followers. Philp. the man who had a huge
deficit every year of his Premiership, and who
promised if he got back to office to abolish most
of the taxes, and to give pretty nearly everything
to everybody, claims to have 27 followers. There
are about men of the Socialism-in-our-
Time persuasion, and two are uncertain, but may
follow Kidston. Nobody is satisfied, and Philp
who had really blown himself out with the idea of
a sure majority, is just as glad as if he had been
hanged. The Tory press now strenuously urges
Kidston to make terms with the battered - ’ 7 .

can lie back, and watch the office-hungry Philp
trying to fix up an impossible coalition with Joe
Lesina. Philp and the advanced Laborites are
so far apart that union between them is impossible
so if the Kidston party is thrown out, then it
only needs to sit tight and watch its opponents
claw hopelessly at the atmosphere. A humorous
politician would get much joy out of the situation,
even if he didn’t get much immediate salary, and
things would sort themselves out in time.

The Insect Premier, J. Carruthers, who seems
Se « a L n - lnjured Ma State in his sleep, threw
this off his pale, anxious chest during a speech of
congratulation on the successful start of the blast
furnace at Sandford’s Lithgow (N.S.W.) Iron
Works:—
We do not want any interference here from the Federal
Government. We started this industry without the
Federal Parliament, and we do not want them (now that
they see this is a success), coddling up other industries in
South Australia and Tasmania. We do not want the tax.
payers of New South Wales taxed, in order to brino- i n t o
existence, by any coddling method, some other industrv
which—having seen what Mr. Sandford can do without
Federal aid—would go and do likewise with half-a-dozen
Federal Ministers around it, and getting credit for it If
he has, by a Protectionist tariff—and we have got it—
built up what promises to be a great industrv, let it be a
fair Protection all round. Mr. Sandford should have a
fair chance, such as is given to every twopenny-ha’pennv
manufacturer in Melbourne and elsewhere. 1
Now Carruthers knows, as well as any man can
know, that under the Constitution the Australian
Parliament cant “coddle up industries in South
Australia and Tasmania 5 without giving exactly
the same aid to the same industries in N.S.W.
•/ the Court would abolish
its deed m one act. Moreover, the Aus-
tralian Parliament has never shown any
of rr d^! ng what Carruthers warns it not
to do. If Deakin were a Carruthers instead of
a gentleman, and if in a public speech he solemnly
warned Carruthers not to make a beast of him-
self in threepenny bars and to keep clear of opium
dens, the insult would be not a whit more base-
less and gratuitous. It looks as if a time may

Government could do other than it did. It called

there are two possibilities left: Australia can

principles, or it can find out what Hans Sour-
krout, the German, will carry the mails for

which Australia will have only a regular mail

carat jevyellery which is really brass or rolled gold

About six years ago-on 13th July, 1901, to be
precise—when the metric system of weights and
measures was being talked about, Melbourne
Argus rushed enthusiastically into the fray, and
energetically boosted the movement along in its
leader columns
They manage these things better in France. . . If
ever there was an undeniable blessing conferred bv the
U P° n thafc P arfc of the world which hasten
en ,°"^ h . to accept it, it has been the decimal
or metric system of weights and measures. . . . That the
a t Ptl ° n - 0f h a . dec,n ? al system would even temporarily
disorgamse business m any degree worth considering
V l6 !u Ct t ii at British interests are wide
fPPf a - d 01 ?iy makes the adjustment more desirable. The
fact is that we continue to use a clumsy and belated
device, under the illusion that because it is old it must
possess some basis deep in nature. No doubt if the
decimal system is lntroducca some ignoramus will fancy
that either he or nature is being over- reached. y
Then the humorous paper laid the subject aside
and cheerfully resumed its usual business of
throwing ink at the Democratic party and trying
to wreck Australian industries. Latelv. the Im-
perial Conference discussions again revived the
question, and on May 2nd, 1907, the Argus roused
itself up and went loose on the subject once more:
Mr. Deakin is pressing; it on the Imperial Conference
lu " D 9 c y rmal fes bitter with metromania, who approach
the subject with academic readiness to pooh-pooh as un-
progressive or reactionary a people who find objections
oo the change, appear to under-estimate the great cost
which would be entailed by the introduction of the
metric system. To propose an unenforcable compulsion
is absurd, yet that is what the proposal amounts to
There is some justification for Great Britain hesitating to
change her system. The metric enthusiasts may point
the finger of scorn at the British, and sneer at them as
muddle-headed, and so on ; but when it comes to examin-
ing the facts the case against the poor benighted folk
who have led the world in commerce is not as convincin«-
as might at first sight appear.
And now some of the Argus’ most faithful
followers are becoming visibly bald in the effort
to make out what their journal really wants them
to think about the metric system.

lhat s the way those parsons expose their ignor-
ance. Heaven was the very first place to apply
the policy of exclusion, and the only place where
there is no exclusion law at all is Hell. The
Scripture says clearly that the great majority are
shut out of Heaven ; “broad is the way' that
leadetb to destruction, and many there be that go
in thereat . . . narrow is the way that leadetn
unto life, and few there be that find it.” There-
fore, the Exclusion Act at Peter’s Gate is plainl v
a hard and comprehensive Act. On the other
Band, that in Australia is so easy that the re-
jections number about one in 500, and if the test
at the door of Heaven were as easy as that, Hell
would be almost empty. The test at the Pearly
Gate is a moral one. As no instrument has yet
been invented which will accurately diagnose a
person s morals, we have a rough and ready racial
test instead. That fool of a parson who didn’t
know that there is an Exclusion Act in Heaven
should go back to the theological college.

For every case of this sort that gets into small

never get even that very faint glimmer of

At times one discovers dwellings which are a menace’to

spot. In the yard of this villa were grouped fowls
jngeons ducks geese, turkeys, dogs, decaying animal
matter, dirt and filth in abundance, and the whole place
rat-infested.
That, as said, referred to Collingwood. In the
country the Health Act is mostly a dead letter •
and the Pure Food Act, which was also foolishly
handed over in a great measure to the councils
is likewise becoming a deceased epistle. Warr’-

that a thing is “inquisitorial” it reckons thatouglit

Waddell, who abandoned his Progressive party
to join Carruthers’ Ministry, is the champion
unsatisfactory political leader of Australia John
See, looking round for something small to fill a
gap, made him a State Minister. When John
See decided to drop the Premiership, Wise and
Crick— the only two personalities of the Cabinet
—were passed over, and Waddell made Premier,
as the most inoffensive and unobtrusive and
generally undistinguished member of the Cabinet.
1 he elections followed, and Premier Waddell put
up no sort of a fight; he just looked after his own
seat, and let the party go hang. The party
naturally hung. After the elections, parties
were left in such an evenly-balanced state that
it was a toss-up whether Waddell could hold on
or not. He had a fighting chance for his life. But
Waddell wasn’t the man to fight. He climbed
down, and allowed Carruthers a bloodless vic-
tory. It was generally understood at the time
that as a reward Waddell was to get a seat in
the Cabinet. Then came the Lands scandals.
Waddell was one of the few prominent members
who seem to have had absolutely clean hands in
that matter. But he played no fighting hand.
Ills attitude of beautiful inoffensiveness would
have done credit to a Quaker martyr. Now

That part of N.S.W. which is vaguely

from the position of Newfoundland. This island
has a grievance of some sort connected with cod-
fish, which Great Britain won’t recognise. New-
foundland is the sore-headed colony which refuses
to federate with the Dominion of Canada, and
when its Premier, at the Conference, trotted out
the codfish story, the British Government inti-
mated that it hadn’t time for Newfoundland
And, while Newfoundland went home with its
rejected cod in its hand, the report went round
that the Prime Minister of Canada was to be
offered a peerage. And Premier Bond, of New-
foundland, is a man who simply yearns after
“honors,” and would prefer them to codfish anv-
day.

When the curtain goes up on a picture of
life 150 years ago, a sunny orchard with apples
dropping-ripe on the boughs, children playing
under the trees, birds twittering, roses uliinbin°-
over the porch of the pretty vicarage, a view of
the stately manor house clear against the sinking
sun, and a comfortably fat lady in hip panniers,
elbow sleeves and smoothly rolled hair, it is a case
°v. • If^ nce lending enchantment to that view
which is always borrowing something without
security and never returning it. The audi-
en°e sighs half in pleasure, half in sadness,
and thinks the world went very well then.'
Exceeding peace broods and casts a feather or two
on the gazers. All the actors and audiences of
that very-well-going time are dead now, and
worms have eaten them, but it is because they and
the_ apple trees, and the birds, are dead that we
feel the exceeding peace of their non-existence.
Jne hundred and fifty years ago was a hideous time
for the poor who were alive in England. But the
cruelty, brutality and stupidity of laws, times and
people find no place in the stage version of “ The
Vicar of Wakefield,” put on at Sydney Palace
on Saturday night by the Brough-Flemming Co.,
under the name of ‘‘Olivia.” And to the artful-
ness of the artificer of the play is due
the fact that it shines like a long-past good deed
out of a naughty, present w orld. This writer is all
the time wondering—a sort of undertow of mental
process whether it would not pay Herbert
Flemming, even at this day, date and generation,
to become a Clerk in Holy Orders, and run for a
bishopric. It s a pity to waste on a mere stage
such an unctuous and benign manner as he can
assume; it’s a grievous pity to hide such legs in
long, perpendicular, crumpled black tunnels in-
stead of publishing them in knee breeches and
black silk stockine\s and buckled shoes. Let the
halo be taken off the Knightly legs at the Koyal,
and be transferred to those of the “Yicar of
Wakefield ” at the Palace.

“ Olivia ” does not accurately follow Oliver
Goldsmith’s story. The main miseries of the
Vicar and his family, such as the bailiffs,
and the debtors’ prison, and other painful cir-
cumstances, are omitted. Olivia runs away with
the Squire, it is true, but what the seducer
thought was a faked marriage is in reality the
genuine thing. It is on the whole a gentle,
pastoral, homely and harmonious piece, like a
gentle reddish cow pondering on a summer after-
noon ; and it rises to intensity but once, when
the Squire in effect tells his victim that she isn’t
an honest woman any more. Olivia's anguish and
horror are well depicted by Miss Beatrice Day,
and previously she plays the very infatuated girl
in charming tones. Mr. Winter Hall as “poor
Mr. Burchell,” the real Squire incog., gets a
capital show, and uses his chance with force
and dignity. The audience at once gets a
I-knew-you-were-a-good-fellow feeling towards
him. Mr. Carter Pickford, as the rakish “act-
ing” Squire, with his “Strike me dumb, but
I love yon, "’ fetches the gallery with that phrase.
It. sounds like a faint echo of the time when men
said ‘ Gad zoolts ” and “ Oddsbodikins,” and the
like. That the gay gallant of that beruffled,
swashbuckling time used the Push language of to-
day at once makes him nearer and dearer to his
hearers. Miss Bessie Major, as Mrs. Primrose,
the vicaress, is just It. She always is It. Little
Gordon Lee is a pretty wench as a farmer’s
daughter. So is Miss M. Meredith, as Sophia—
the sweet Sophy. Mr. Gregan McMahon hasn’t
much to do but stand around, dressed in green,
and look foolish. On the whole, “Olivia” is
hereby wished many happy returns of last Satur-
day and its big audience.

“ The Silver King,” the parent bird of all
melodrama, was revived by the Julius Knight
co. at Sydney Royal on Saturday. The play
labors under one handicap. There is hardly any
old man who, in his heyday, did not see the star
emotional, actor of that golden period take the
part of Wilfred Denver. Revivals of this sort in-
variably affect the more or less aged with a viru •
lent attack of the reminiscing complaint, and the
resulting distress occasioned to the theatre-going
young tends to react disastrously on the fortunes of
the piece. Its luck is damaged by ancient inhabi-
tants who remember how much more capably it
was played in their garish youth, when the world
hadn’t degenerated, and when a boy got up volun-
tarily before dawn and chopped ten cartloads of
wood previous to breakfast. On its merits, this
production deserves some success. It is carefully
interpreted by mostly capable performers. It is
a relief to see Denver’s part played in rational
clothes; why one who fancies he has committed a
murder should return to his native land, and hide,
from Justice in patent-leather riding boots, frock-
coat, long white hair, and a slouch hat that would
arouse comment in a den of anarchists (as the con-
vention has been during the last quarter of a
century) is a mystery of stage-craft. Miss Marion
vxrey acts sympathetically, and succeeds in looking
very graceful and Burne-Jones}' as Nellie Denver*
and the other parts are satisfactorily filled. The
Julius Knight season ends to-morrow, and the co
leaves on Saturday to shake the noble leg of Julius
in Maoriland.

“The Squatter’s Daughter,” a realistic
Australian drama, produced for the first time in
Sydney at the Criterion on Saturday, has much of
sensational and historic interest —but it will stand
or fall ultimately, in all likelihood, by the appeal
it makes to the student of heredity. The action
takes place in the old, lawless days of Ben Hall.
*' aratah Station possesses in Tom Bathurst,
overseer, one of the most overpoweringly
honest, courageous, eloquent, resourceful and
altogether admirable young fellows ever seen.
His virtues are oppressive, and he doesn’t possess
one redeeming vice. But his parentage is un-
known ; and where his many splendid qualities
come from, seeing that he isn’t a squatter’s son
and has inherited no sheep, is a mystery. On the
other hand, the truly infernal William Dudley
Harrington is the “supposed son” of James
Harrington, of the proper blue-blooded station
brand. How a man with so much live-stock ever
beget one so entirely loathsome as
Dudley would be a hopeless puzzle to all, did
not the programme, by emphasising “supposed,”
give a hint as to the real situation. Of course it
is a case of exchanged identities. Tom is really
the son of Harrington, while Dudley is an im-
postor, having been placed by his ruffianly old
convict father, Nick Harvey, in Tom’s cradle at
that early age when all babies look and howl
alike. Providentially, in this case the wrong is
righted, and all ends well, owing to the production
by Tom, in Act IV., of a locket containing
his late mother’s portrait the same having
been moored around his neck in infancy by
that lady, and cherished by him ever since.
It is a valuable habit of the mother in melodrama
to adorn her progeny with lockets o- birth-marks,
and the custom might well be im.tatcd in real
life. The timely revelation shows once more that
only a squatter and his relatives can be really
noble, and that you have only to count how many
bullocks a man has to know all about his character.
If the bullocks die in a drought, presumably the
squatter becomes a miscreant of the deepest hue
till he gets more bullocks.
* * . *
“ The Squatter’s Daughter ” represents an
effort to supply home-made melodrama. It can
claim no serious attention as a work of dramatic
art, for melodrama isn’t dramatic art in any real
sense of the word. But since the public
wants a strictly conventional fbrm of impro-
bable story, garnished with impossible situations
and glaringly obvious humor, it may as well
have it supplied by Australian authors, and Mr.
Bailey and Mr. Duggan (they say that Mr.
Bailey, the comedian, wrote all the pathos, and
Mr. Duggan all the funny parts) can at least
claim to have done their work much better
than the average toiler in the field of bloodshed
and impossibility. “The Squatter's Daughter ”
is well acted by Miss Dug can, George Cross, Bert
Bailey, Laurence Dunbar, Edmund Duggan, and
some small human details.

The golden eggs that “ Mother Goose ” has
been laying at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, will shortly
hatch into the “Spring Chicken.” After that
the present valuable bird will be put in a coop
and sent to Bendigo, where the gold yield has
been falling off lately. They have tried shafts,
drives, and crosscuts without effect ; now they
are to gi ve J. C. Williamson’s fowl a chance.
When she is done with Bendigo she will go back
to Melbourne for a few nights’ roost. Meantime,
that small part of Sydney that hasn’t vet seen her
had better hurry up.

Blinking cats’ eyes are now the brightest
stars at Sydney Tivoli, where a sleek team made its
first, appearance on Saturday. They are well-
trained cats, of the tame variety, which spring
from pillar to post, walk wires, evolute among
ninepins, and generally indicate that they could
steal their neighbor’s fish with more agility than
any other cats that ever were born. In other
respects it is the same old Tivoli—including the
same old coon song about the same old Zulu and
the familiar o.ld moon.

An orchestral concert at Melbourne Town
Hall, last Saturday afternoon, introduced to this
country a remarkable pianiste, whose European
reputation can hardly be said to have preceded
her. Until quite lately, Teresa Carreno was a
name unknown in Melbourne outside of the small
circle where musical art, and the fame of foreign
professors thereof, is discussed with more or less
intelligence. The recent announcement, that
Benno Scherek had arranged a Carreno tour, was
the public’s first intimation of the lady’s im-
portance, and it acquainted folks in general
with the fact that if her name had been
critically classed with Paderewski, and other such
expensive performers, she had certainly not been
as expert as the long-haired Polish pianist in
the art of world-wide advertising. On Saturday
she came to light and hearing—a gracious, hand-
some, grey-haired Carreno, a little stouter than
some of her portraits, but otherwise quite true to
them—and long before she had finished her task
the audience was her slave for life. The first
number on the programme was the “Flying
Dutchman’’overture for Marshall Hall’s orchestra,
the performance being excellent only in its drum
part. There is music apart from loud tumult in
this descriptive work, but in the matter of graphic
description the drummer distanced all competitors.
» * * *
Beethoven’s “Emperor ” Concerto brought
Mrs. Carreno to the piano. For a while she was
of minor consequence, because the orchestra at
first got all the “fat,” and didn’t seem to deserve
it. Three years ago Paderewski and a Marshall
Hall orchestra played the same concerto on the
same platform. On that occasion the orchestra
probably did much better than its recent perform-
ance, whereas the hairy pianist failed to play his
best, or second best, though, of course, he was
vociferously applauded all the same. On Saturday
it remained for the soloist to supply all the senti-
ment. Her touch was as expressive as her inter-
pretation of the music. The orchestral interrup-
tions and accompaniments sounded, in many
cases, hard and unfeeling in comparison with the
results that the grey-haired lady was getting from
her box of music. Playing against that back-

The writer had to catch the charm of
Carreno’s playing from a hard corner seat at the
far end of the balcony, next to a wide-opened
door, where giggling Conservator)um girls were
always being admitted by giggling little ushers,
and nothing could be seen ahead save the cumu-
lative back of an intervening crowd. Owing to
the open-door policy, the writer didn’t stay to
hear the pianiste play Liszt’s Hungarian
Fantasia. He took a delightfully clever per-
formance for granted. Moreover, he had
previously taken 10 or 15 minutes of a
heavy Beethoven aria, sung by Miss Florence
Ballara (formerly Towl). Miss Towl was a Con-
servatorium pupil who, like Miss Henderson and
others, went to Germany and was reported by
cable to have sung with great success at Dussel-
dorf, or Musselberg, or Cofengurgel. But, like
all the other girls whose young voices were suckled
on German music, she will never sing with great
success in this country. How weird is the warbling
that one hears at a Marshall Hall orchestral
concert!
Carreno pianoforte recitals, undisturbed
by the assistance of a hasty orchestra, were to be
on Monday and Wednesday of this week, and a
third falls due on Saturday. The public, that
paid guineas and half-guineas to hear Paderewski,

for Carreno, seeing that the maximum price is 6s,

Bland Holt, having run “ The White

tocracy, is about to stage another Drury Lane
drama in preference to something of a less reason-

one good Drury Laner has deserved another to
follow it up, and the circumstance reflects favor-
ably on local intelligence. The drama due on
Saturday is “ The Great Millionaire,” which
holds the mirror of nature up to the grasping capi-
talist and shows him the error of his ways. For-
merly it was Walter Baker who worked a
“corner” in wheat, and fattened on the privations
of his fellow Christians, but Baker is still on

designs upon the quartern loaf. Meanwhile,
Styan aforesaid will make two more attempts to
euchre his lawful wife, and will get left at the
bottom of the sea in a diving dress each time.

The ‘ ‘ Bonnie Scotland ” Biograph, at the
Athenaeum Hall, is now associated with a series
of mining pictures, and The Poseidon Gold Rush
inspires the small boys on the back benches to go
forth in search of nuggets. The biograph business
is so; demoralising that the Taits may be fairly
suspected of having planted the nugget which
transpires on their latest film; nevertheless a scene
of mock rejoicing over a bogus lump of luck is an
improvement on the spectacle of a spurious Ned

“ 0.K.” writes
The admirers of Wagnerian opera are divided into two
distinct classes —the terribly musical class that snorts
disdainfully at lyric operas, thinly and
orchestrated, and the others, whose education is not
pedantic, but whose ear has been trained to a full appreci-
ation of what is great in Wagner’s work. As a converted
scoffer, I can still sympathise with them who scoff, but I
am “dead sure’’that the pedants have the best of the
argument. Nor was I quite converted until I heard and
saw the German master’s operas treated in a genuinely
German manner by the Teutons of Musgrove’s present
co. They have, it is true, a heavy foreign manner in
French and Italian works. On the other hand, the
quality of the voice and vivacity of method of the Italians
or French are quite unsuited to the interpretation of
Wagner opera parts. You may get fine performances from
artists of the more phlegmatic races—English-speaking
or otherwise—who, not being Germans, have a natural
brightness of voice. The Australian Melba is accepted as
an unrivalled Elsa in “Lohengrin.” But for a satisfac-
tory performance of a Wagner opera you must have the
German conditions, and Musgrove’s Co., although not
first-class, is at least a competently German organisation,
the one non-Teutonic member —Miss Anderson—being
something of a Melba in the work she was specially en-
gaged for. And the orchestra conductor, Slapoffskj, a
Cockney Russian or an Anglo-Polish Jew by birth, is
soundly Wagnerian in his musical taste and scholarship.

The Svengalis, who made their first appear-
ance at the Opera House on Saturday, are more
clever than entertaining. One of them comes
down among the audience, and invites people to
put a name, privately, to a well-known char-
acter, living or dead, or a popular musical
air. On the stage there is another male
Svengali seated in front of a pigeon-holed
cabinet, stocked with wigs and make-ups, and off
the stage is a spry attendant who brings him
from an adjacent wardrobe whatever garment he
requires for the character selected. A lady Sven-
gali sits at a piano prepared to play and sing to
order; and both performers get the “tip” per
medium of the first Svengali, who never speaks,
and cannot possibly be in direct communication
with them. He appears to talk with movements
of hands and fingers against his brow, and the
words spelt by these obvious handtics (to coin a
word) are somehow conveyed to the two workers
on the stage. 1 The character-impersonator, and
the attendant who brings coats and helmets to
him, show a remarkably ready knowledge of their
s.tock-in-trade. The lady at the piano has an
immense variety of tunes and song words at her
instant command. But the impersonations are
crude, the music and singing bits are merely
“knocked off” to meet the demand, and the
result is not more exciting to the ignorant
onlookers than a conjuror’s mysterious produc-
tion of a card which the selector declares to be
“ right.” All the same, it is a show calculated to
rouse curiosity.

Adelaide is highly commending itself for
the enthusiastic support it gives to Wagner—not
quite realising that “Lohengrin” and “Tann-
hauser ” are merely Wagner-for-tlie-young-be-
ginner. The orchestra started with capable
musicians insufficiently rehearsed, but it has been
improving all the week. The only novelty is
“Hansel and Gretel,” a kind of soulful panto-
mime, which is reserved for afternoon shows. The
Pierrots have finished their season at the Town
Hall; the Hippodrome has broken out into
melodrama flavored with Horse ; and the Tivoli
continues its bright but not specially remarkable
all-round variety show.
AT POVERTY POINT.
THE NEW CRUSADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Bishop of London, the Rev. J. S. Lidgett, and
various Nonconformist ministers, have begun a crusade
against exhibitions of living statuary.
If that your shape be passing fair
And statuesque in every curve,
’Twill bring on you the proper share
Of wrath that all such things deserve.
Because of those without a flaw,
Prom god-like head to ditto toes,
We have been forced to frame this law —
“ Thou shalt not pose ! ”
And if you are of form divine —
Each part to each proportioned right—
It forms no part of our design
To let you shock us with the sight.
We hope we make our meaning clear,
But once again, before we close,
We’ll bellow this into your ear —
“ Thou shalt not pose ! ”
MAORILAND. SINC. S. CLARK.
Just as the interest in Miss Modern Milo Pansy Mon-
tague was dying out in England, a gentleman named Luca
kindly came along in a false beard and committed suicide,
and manager Cruickshank Laing plunged into the adver-
tising opportunity with four feet. The deceased was said
by Cruickshank. to have been smitten with a platonic
affection of the most malignant type for the hand-painted
lady with not much on. He wrote her letters (quoted by
Cruickshank) and poems (also quoted by Cruickshank),
and, finally, because Miss Milo took exception to the tone
of the letters, which Cruickshank says were, extremely
respectful, he went away, bought a false beard, and slew
himself in cold blood. The acquaintance of the late
Lucas with Milo seems to have been of the very flimsiest
character, and indeed, apart from the eviderice tendered
by Cruickshank to the press, with poems attached, there
is nothing to indicate that he was even aware of the
existence of the voluminous heart-breaker. No word of
Milo was mentioned at the inquest, and there was no ex-
planation as to why Lucas died wrapped in bogus
whiskers.
“ Melb.” : There has been a flutter over a supposed
point of etiquette between Miss Tittell Brune and Gas-
ton Mervale. On the first night of the revival of “ Leah
Kleschna” there was the usual call at the end of the
second act. Miss Brune took the call. When she had
retired there were shouts for Mervale, but no Mervale
transpired. Miss Brune came on again, and said that
through some misunderstanding Mr. Mervale would not
eventuate. Nor did Mervale come on for any call that
night. At the final call, Miss Brune seemed to be extend-
ing her hand for him. But he didn’t happen. This
occurrence exemplifies the wisdom of the rule that no
performer is to address the audience without the consent
of the management. Mervale wrote to the papers next
day stating that be was not huffy at anything. He
only refused to appear on principle. The whole practice
needs to be overhauled. Why shouldn’t the actor stay
inside the picture—the place where he is paid to be? if
people want to see him outside of it he is occasionally
visible in the sixpenny bar.
“Snell”: The little disputation in Melbourne papers
re the artistic W'isdom of an actor taking- calls between
the acts, reminds that Tittell Brune, more than any other
considerable actress we have entertained here, deserves
rebuke for her avidity in jumping out and spreading her
palpitating arms to the public. There is something al-
most pathetic in Miss Brune’s eagerness to respond, and
her affectations W'hen she does respond give one that
feeling of fatigue. She gasps, and staggers, and presses
her heaving bosom as who might say : “ Friends, I come
at your imperative call. I am here, but heaven knows
w'hat agony it costs me. This life is killing me ! ”
The little row in Melbourne Majesty’s over recalls brings
back a recollection of the same house when it was un-
fashionable, and given over to fitful bursts of melodrama
and bits of circus, with an occasional prize-fight thrown
in. The star lady of the moment was a g-lutton for re-
calls. When she played the misfortunate heroine in
“ East Lynne,” she was ready to dash out before the cur-
tain on the smallest provocation. After the big scene in
which she repudiates the villain, and casts his dirty
money in his teeth, she staggered before the “ rag” three
times and heaved her large white bosom at the audience.
Then, still thinking she heard something that resembled
public appreciation, she made a fourth venture. The
thin house looked at her coldly and in silence, and at last
a penetrating, childish voice from the gallery cried : “No
one ain’t clappin’, Miss. It was on’y a dog barkin’ in the
passage.”
“Hamer”: Scoffs about the unnatural language of
bellowdrama are common ; but a dramatic instinct is
born in most people, and the language they hear in
dramatic situations on the stage comes natural to them
when they meet dramatic situations off the stage. I met
an instance in a Sydney park recently. She rose to her
full height and said: “ Yar villain, how-dare var talk
bus to me ! ” Then she crossed the stage with a dramatic
sweep, and turned as the villain still pursued her—he was
imploring her not to make a row- and attract people.
“ Stand back ! ” she exclaimed. “ Advance another step
and I will call for yelp.” He pursued no further. Ex-
plaining hurriedly that he had only asked her to come
down to Chowder, he said something about the unrelia-
bility of “ skirts,” and left.
Young H. H. Wallace is doing excellently as a comedian
with the Williamson cos. During this “ Mother Goose ”
pantomime, Wallace has under-studied Harry Shine seve-
ral times, and has done it well.
Why is Wagner’s “ Die Walkiire ” anglicised into “ The
Valkyrie”? As a translation of German pronunciation of
the original word, “ Valkyrie” is incorrect. “ Volkeerer ”
w-ould be nearer the mark. And if it is considered safe to
run Italian operas under their Italian names, without ex-
plaining that the G in “ Pagliacci ” doesn’t count, and the
last four letters amount to “archie,” or something very
like it, why be so concerned about the popular Australian
reading of the German letter W and those two dots over
the ii ? For w-hich matter it is pretty generally under-
stood that the German tongue can’t put an English
sound to the tw-enty-third letter of our alphabet.
Frank Thornton will be back in Sydney next
Christmas. This time he brings a fanciful, farcical
comedy, “ When Knights were Bold,” which is so quaintly
original in design that it might have been invented by
W. S. Gilbert, and wasn’t.
The principal attractions of the Albani Concert Co. will
be the lady’s artistic method and seasoned reputation,
and William Green’s voice. Bill Green is said to be as
good as the best of the English tenors now on the market;
also he has a reputation for ready wit, which is an excel-
lent thing in a tenor, anyhow. Coming after the German
opera exponents of love song, the melodious Green should
be much adored. Other supportersof the old-time “star"
are a contralto (Miss Mildred Jones), a pianiste, and a
violinist. They are due in Melbourne first week in June.
Mrs. Albani, it is gravely and sentimentally stated, has
come this time to say farewell to Australasia. _ She is, of
course, younger than Patti, who had been a prima donna
for some years ere the French-Canadian singer put in her
claim to rivalry. A previous rival was Christine Nilsson,
born in 1843, the same year as Patti uttered her first top-
note. Albani’s birth year is variously stated as 1850,1849,
or “about 1847,” and her professional name (taken from
Albany, U.S.A., where she made her debut) seems to have
set the fashion in such adaptations. The paternal name
was La Jeunesse. It w’ould sound rather out of place
these times. Miss “Youth!”
Managerial motto—Every Tittell helps.
“Star”: The Svengalis, who gave a preliminary
private view at Melbourne Opera House, the other day,
are one of many such partnerships that have sprung up
since the big success of the Zancigs in London. Of
course it was an old game 20 years ago, this fake tele-
pathy, but the Zancig boom has shaken up the old bones.
The Zancigs pretend to mysterious powers, but it is all
a matter of codes, code words and code signals. There
are half-a-score of methods of communication, but the
successful system now is based on codes. It requires a
good memory and much expertness on the part of trans-
mitter and receiver, butdoesnot call for half the training
that goes to make a successful sleight-of-hand performer.
The Svengalis vary the old process with songs and im-
personations. To the person who is not willing to be
deceived, this kind of turn is not a huge joy, but it must
be remembered that nine-tenths of a vaudeville audience
delight in being deceived. “ The fellow you can’t bluff
doesn’t count! ” was the motto of the boss of a big magic
show that did Australia last year. He doesn’t count be-
cause he is too few.
That amazing musician, Frederick Beard, who lately
issued a booklet to let Melbourne know why he brought
his talent to this country, and what he intended to do
for its naturally artistic people, seems to have been
rather long in making up his mind to stay. A letter that
Mr. Beard wrote to ’Ome last year depicts him as an
anxious Frederick waiting to be recalled from exile. It
was cruel to put it into print, but it got there, and here
we have it from an English paper : “ In a letter to the
Birmingham Choral Society Mr. Beard says: ‘I left
England on August Bth last, and up to now have not
received any communication whatever from the com-
mittee or any official of the Society. Had I had the
slightest encouragement I should have returned. I
awaited every mail with hopeful and intense interest. I
received some private communications from friends, which
seemed to infer that the Society could do without me.
So, after serious deliberation, I decided to accept the
offers tendered to me here, but I do not feel at home. The
colonials do not view musical art seriously or intelligently
enough, and I have mixed feelings as to whether they
will for some considerable time to come, owing to their
being so overwhelmingly satisfied with themselves,’ ” &c.
And this from a man who compiles a book of self-
laudation, with his portrait for a frontispiece !
CONFRONTING HIS OWN JIM-JAM.
This Socialism which means death to the best interests
of our Commonwealth, must be checked. Let us, there-
fore, assert ourselves and confront this monster in the
most effective way possible.— Recent utterance by a Tory
person.
“The Stork”: Ned Duggan of Anderson’s brigade,
who had Bert Bailey for partner in the perpetration of
“ The Squatter’s Daughter,” is working, single-handed, on
another bellow, which will he staged presently. The
yarn, which is devoid of the overworked bushranging'
element, deals with the early Victorian gold rush, the
wreck of the Dunbar off Sydney Heads, and Eureka '
Stockade, including the hoisting of the Horstralian Flag
by the miners.
Philip Lytton, with his “moving theatre,” is proving
that money's surprisingly accessible to a fairly good co.
in the semi-outback. His crowd, numbering twenty-five,
is “ starred ” by Madge Hope, and carries nearly thirty
tons of “ props.” Playing seven nights at Inverell
(N.S.W.) recently one evening’s takings soared giddily
to £136.
“ Not at all, oh, not at all! ” snarled a society hyena at
a Sydney social function, the other day," when a gossiper
retailed the news of a certain little Australian having
been commanded to sing before King Edward and the
Queen. “ Oh, not at all ! The only Australian to date who
has been so commanded is Madame Melba. Of course,
you read about people singing at Windsor Castle, but that
is wholly different, though you can’t blame people for not
knowing it. The person you refer to sang there, of
course, and so have other Australians—merely engaged
by Sir Walter Parrott, the court musician, but not at all
commanded by their Majesties—oh, not at all!”
Beatrice Miranda, according to recent news of her fro®
London, will not have to wait as long as sister Lalla
waited of yore ere she gets a fine start on the operatic
stage. But she will have some distance to go, of course,
before she arrives at her sister’s position in the front
rank, of the forefront of the second rank, of grand-opera
artists. Paris Figaro lately said of the trillsome Lalla :
“ They write us from Lisbon thatMdlle. Miranda has sung
‘ Rigoletto ’ with very great success. The brilliant singer
has again received from the public of Lisbon the same
warm appreciation that she always gained in that role at
Brussels, Bordeaux and Nice.”
Mrs. Emma Fames, the celebrated soprano, who
lately divorced her husband, the equally celebrated
artist, Julian Story (no mere struggler this last, by
the way, but a wealthy product of Eton and Oxford),
“ got wise,” as the Yankees say, to her festive spouse’s
proceedings in rather a curious way. At a masked ball
in the U.S.A. the prima donna overheard two unknown
dames speculating as to what costume a certain gorgeous
debutante was wearing, and they agreed that the verities
would be best served by that of Juliet, since Mr. Story
was Romeo. Result: Suspicion, investigation, and a
decree nisi. Moral (amongst others): Never talk scandal
before a woman in a mask.

News comes that a London “pension” is flooded with
the melody of four Australian tenors, who abide together.
Walter Kirby, Hal Cohen, Thorold Waters, and Watts.
With the aid of young Castles and Turnbull, these youths
sang for their supper one night when they were feeling
gay and blithesome, and wanted to shake up the globe.
Midst much London fog - , they stood beneath mansion
windows warbling lustily, until Jeamesde la Pluche came
and a e them money to go away, or Chawles or Tumrnas
cauu- out with a contribution. Whereupon the combined
tenors adjourned to an adjacent caf6 and jubilated into
the small hours.
Stead (of the Review of Reviews) was guilty of an indis
cretion when, in entertaining The Modern Milo to tea, ho
omitted to invite the Bishop of London along with the
other dignitaries who met her. It is probably on account
of this lapse that the Bishop is now heading a violent
crusade against the “naked show” business, with Milo
singled out for special attack.
“Haresfoot”: I have been reading a kindly reference
in print to the Misses Targett, Fitzgerald, Springett, and
Louise, who were ballet pioneers in Sydney and Mel-
bourne half a century ago ! Mr. William Ryan will re-
member them well. They were always sought after as
the champion pantomime Pas de Quatre, and the ques-
tion was which city would get them. Possibly they have
not all gone to the celestial transformation scene in sing-
ing-comedian Alexander’s “ Glory Song.” They may not
all be with the stage-carpenters who are shifting clouds.
The ballet is tough. Of course, it is hardly possible for
any of the quartette to be still on the light fantastic toe.
One may have become a grandmother, but they were
girls of a rather cynical turn of mind. They always
clung together. The bursting bowers of bounding beauty,
at the home of the fairy queen by the silver lake, were
sure to have a good ballet if the quartette could only be
got. Otherwise, it might be ramshackly. “ Well, girls,”
Mr. Coppin would say, “ I suppose you are a year older
than last Christmas.” “ Oh, indeed, no, Mr. Coppin,”
replied the volatile Springett, “ we are a year more experi-
enced and valuable 1 ”
“ Peacock ” : Marcus Julius is so taken up with his art
that he often rehearses his part on the way home after
the play. The Brigadier doesn’t know the risks he runs.
T’other night, fishing at a coffee stall, I observed Superbus
tearing along the street, sickbed o’er with the pale cast
of grease paint. A change ! He smote the midnight air.
His face twitch d with suppressed passion. One hand
clenched his umbrella sword fashion. He was gesticu-
lating violently—it must have been a murder scene.
Feeling curious I followed. A drunk was interested. He
had one arm round a large brown paper parcel, the other
round a lamp-post. Jewlius heeded him not. Swinging
gracefully with his brolly, he narrowly missed the drunk,
whose hat fell off with fright. Marcus Stupendous strode
on with godlike indifference. From the asphalt, the
drunk, watching the exciting mummer, hiccupped “Lor-
lumme ! ” and sat thoughtfully down upon his parcel of
crayfish.
Mary Conly, doing well as a singer in the Fog country,
was leading soprano, for some years, of the choir at Dr.
Strong’s Australian Church, Melbourne. The roof of the
same tabernacle kept the rain off three other song-birds
on wet Sundays—Ada Crossley, Lalla Miranda and Maggie
Stirling.
“ Wonga ” : Let us do swift and silent murder on the
instigators of those criminal proceedings called Musical
Competitions, and conceal the body in an eerie spot.
But for these things Miss Opena Larynx would not “go
through” the “Jewel Song” ten times in two hours in
the morning, and about three times any evening when it
is warm enough to open all the parlor windows. Neither
would Master Nelson Wellington Skytower, aged ten,
bawl “ Hafa league, hafa league, hafa league onward,”
every time there does not happen to be a football kicking
round the street. These competitions are the main cause
of that rapidly increasing enlargement of the head which
prevents the cranium getting through the door. At the
recent Warrnambool (Vic.) shivoo of this kind, the scene
in which Juliet swallows the opiate was the prescribed
item for the elocution “ prize.” Some dozen maidens of
all sizes and shapes, a few with a marked Tittell Brune
accent, the most with no accent at all, essayed the doleful
passage, and at least one of the crowd was actress enough
to cause a sensation. When she had reached the fatal top
note of “ Romeoh, I come, this do I drink —ah to thee,”
she hurled the bottle from her straight at the audience,
and it struck a youth on the head. Somebody
gathered up the bottle, and behold, the label on it cried
in a loud voice, “ Horse Pills !” Think of Juliet of Verona
taking a horse pill or a cow-medicine that she might re-
join her Romeo in a better world !
The black-labor people, and the papers
that give them a sneaking support, are talking as
though it were only the Queensland sugar busi-
ness that is short of workmen. But the Chillagoe
(N.Q.) Mining Co. is scouring even as far afield as
Westralia for workmen, the Queensland Govern-
ment navvying works are in need of men, the
Vulcan and other N.Q. mines can’t get the miners
they want, and at the Broken Hill mines almost
any sort of a man can get a job. Yet nobody
ventures to suggest that White Australia should
be sacrificed for the temporary benefit of the
mine-owner. Victoria settled that point 30 years
ago.
“Q.” : The Bulletin (11/4/’O7) casts a
justifiable brick when it says “On how many
kiddies’ tombstones should the record read :
‘ Died of trying to multiply something by a table
in which square yards make a perch !”’ B. ’•
will be glad to know that in N.S. Wales, at least,
the new syllabus is making an effort to do away ;
with that bugbear of primary school life, arith-
metical examples involving division by 30£.
Beyond knowing that square yards make a
perch, children in N.S.W. State schools are not
now expected to have any acquaintance with the
horror.
The other day Perth (W.A.) had a notion
that the Stinking Fish party was touring on
board the s.s. Kanowna, which had just arrived
at the port twelve miles away. Then the health
authorities started to investigate the smell, and
found that the basis thereof was a consignment of
fish which our yellow brother at Port Darwin had
despatched to one of his countrymen, a “ mer-
chant ”in Perth. Says a local recorder :
The fish had been salted without cleaning, and then
dried. Examination showed that the flesh had decom-
posed until it was of the consistency of axle-grease, while
the smell was revolting. It is not the practice of the de-
partment to seize foods consigned to the Chinese, as it
is recognised their national standard does not conform
with our own ; but there could be no question about
this consignment being dangerously bad.
As to the question of not seizing objectionable
foods consigned to Chinese, various authorities
on leprosy hold that the regular eating of even
slightly tainted salt fish may cause that disease,
and then it is just as likely as not to spread to
clean people who are particular about their
fish. For instance, certain African tribes which
like their dried fish “high,” have produced many
lepers. It is quite bad enough for Ah Whiff to
gorge himself with disease-producing delicacies,
but he doesn’t stop at that —he vends the same
to any European who is sufficiently foolish
to see no harm in eating in a Chinese restaurant.
All things considered, it seems quite time for the
health authorities at Perth and elsewhere to
revise their views on national fish standards.

In' the Shop Assistants case, before
N.S.W. Arbitration Court, oiie rag-retailer ex-
cused his weekly half-crown pittance to his
younger employees with the assertion that
They were not permitted to serve customers. They
watched other assistants, and it was necessary to have
two or three years’ experience before serving customers.
Writer knows half-a-dozen girls in the trade.
Unanimously, their time for “watching” was
just nil, their start to earn that whole half-crown
was hurriedly immediate, and their time for
mastering the intricate customer-serving profes-
sion was a month or less—mostly 30 days less.

H. C. Chomley, secretary for organised
Victorian Anti-Sosh at last Federal elections, first
quarrelled with Grace Watson, he says, because
of her repeated public statements of the Labor
party’s alleged designs on the sanctity of home.
Strange that all the most shocking election per-
juries were the work of women. Chomlev is a
man, anyway, and he objected, and Grace didn’t
like him any more. Later he had to proceed
against Grace, and this is how she shaped in the
witness-box under cross-examination
Did you say you would never forgive him for sayinv
that?—No, I would not say a thing- like that.
Why?—lt would be such a foolish remark to make.
Do you never use it ?—I trv to avoid it as much as pos-
sible, because it seems to be so effeminate.
But Grace’s clothes, and her sex, and her back
hair, and her spiteful reiteration of Janet Clarke’s
slanders of the Labor party are all effeminate,
and Grace’s coeksureness that she didn’t
say a thing because it would have been foolish
to say it is effeminate too. Grace’s only
chance of avoiding effeminacy is to die imme-
diately and be cremated. Grace, by the way,
won her case on a .side issue which should make
\ er £ eel fairly mean - The Chief Justice held that
she had made a very unpleasant statement about
Chomley, and that the statement was wholly
untrue, but Grace got off without paying damages,
on the ground that the occasion was privileged,
and that her untruth didn’t really injure Chomley!

All through last week the Arbitration
Court sat in Sydney and listened to the tale of
the drapery assistant and the drapery employer.
There were employers who expressed liberal ideas
—Lassetter, Buchanan, and a few more—and there
were other employers. Also there were employees
who appeared to be fairly contented, and other
employees. But the general impression which
remains is that God never intended that which
He made in His own image to be a draper ;
that drapery is mostly a meek and ill-paid pro!
fession ; and that nobody from the underclothing
department ever changed the course of history.
The most frequent characteristics of the trade
appear to be poor pay, the existence of very many
different rules under which the employee may be
fined, the need for profound servility towards
Mrs. Do Cat from Darling Point, the impossibility
of making much out of “spiffs’’and yet keeping the
Ten Commandments intact, the eternal necessity
for wearing ten-shilling clothes on a half-crown
income, and a habitual curvature of the spine
which should only be called for in a contortionist.
There is no reason why the selling of clothes
should not be as manly an occupation as the selling
of coal, but somehow, under present conditions, it
appears that it usually isn’t.

The difficulty of identifying John Keegan
is one of the present troubles of the N.S.W. Law
courts. Very many years ago John is said to
have fallen over a cliff on the South Coast and
stopped the planet with his head. Thereafter he
seems to have become strange in his manner and
flustered in his views, and after fitful comings
and goings he went altogether and remained away
for 15 years. When he, or somebody who said he
was he, returned, he, or the other person, found
that the Law had officially presumed his death,
and his wife had sold his property to the State as
part of the Cataract Dam resumptions. The
person who claimed to be Keegan held out his
hand for the price of the. property, which was
already paid for, and all the State put into it
was the smile of incredulity and the clod of
derision. Mrs. Keegan, who, in her capacity as a
widow, sold the property and got the money,
refuses to recognise Keegan, but his daughter
and some old friends give him their cordial
support. All this is confusing, and lacking
in system. If everybody had a number, and
the figure was indelibly branded on him or her at
the age of 15 or so, it might make the person—
especially her—howl somewhat during the brand-
ing process, and the odor of burnt flesh at the
State branding department might be objection-
able, but it would certainly save a great many
problems of identity, and a great many law ex-
penses.

“Jim Australia” writesl read this
in the Age :
A pathetic scene took place when Captain Barton left
Port Moresby. The natives and their headmen crowded
round crying - that they had lost their friend, and express-
ing fears that they would not be looked after. But Cap-
tain Barton reassured them, and said that the King’s
Government would go on, and, whoever was there in his
place, they might rest satisfied that they would be safe.
How these Britishers love guff!—the “pathetic
scene, and the “headmen crowding around,”
and the “King’s Government,” which it isn’t,
except nominally. Anahaubada, the village of
Port Moresby, has been under the blessed rule of
missionaries for 25 years, and it is the dirtiest
village in Papua. The headmen may have cried,
because they imagined they were to be left wholly
to the missionaries; but it is a wonder that

Every animal, barring one, in Wellington
(M.L.) Zoo, was stoned to death by boys, the
other day. So complete were the arrangements
for the subsequent burial of the dead that the
whole operation was over in half-an-hour. The
sole survivor of the Zoo is a young lion, given to
the windy city by the Bostock-Womb well circus-
folk. The dead multitude was an emu. Now the
city has to start afresh with its original lion. The
boys haven’t been hanged yet, but they should be.

AN UNEVEN START.
LILLA : “ Mother, Tommy's kept the big orange himself."
MOTHER : “But Tommy is much older than you, dear."
LILLA : “ Well, then, I should have the big one, ’cos he must have had a lot before I was borned.”
Wellington (M.L.) had a fatal tramway
smash on one of its precipitous mountain tracks
the other day, and the coroner’s jury hung on to
the face of the cliff to see the pieces of car. One
looker-on, who had got into the habit of being a
coroner’s juryman, pushed into the circle and
volubly instructed the coroner as to his conduct
of the affair. The coroner snarled, and the pre-
vailing policeman reached for the habitual jury-
man. When the jury subsequently took its seat
at the iiiside part of the proceedings, the officials
found there was one juryman in excess of the
number therein made and provided. With tears
in his eyes the excrescence, who had warned the
coroner that no jury could find anything without
him, remarked that he had been a faithful corpse-
viewer for 30 years, and it was red-hot that the
police should go back on him in his old age.
Again the blue sleeve shot out, and a chagrined
ex-professional juryman wept his way into the
habitual drizzle of Gfod’s Own Capital.

“ Sinksee ” : Was recently at a country
race meeting in Canterbury (M.L.). Saw a trio of
lanky, whiskered individuals draw up and form
themselves into a hollow triangle between the 10-
bob tote and the refreshment tent. Thereafter
the apex of the triangle unfurled a banneret upon
which, in large black letters, the following
cryptic legend was inscribed: “Whoso be-
lieveth not shall be DAMNED.” “ Damned ”
had a line all to itself, and took up as much
room as all the rest of the threat put to-
gether. from which fact I inferred that
the triangle was a religion. Subsequent
conversation with the base thereof con-
firmed my suspicions. I learned that this
religion’s own particular copyrighted
title is “ The United Brotherhood of
Practical Followers of our Lord ”
which is a big mass of nomenclature
to share round amongst three. Their
ritual is refreshingly simple. There is
no preaching, no singing, no knee-drill,
no anything except forming up into
triangles, wearing whiskers, and looking
holy. Asked the base of the mathe-
matical figure what he reckoned to get
out of it. “Berruther,” he replied in
a voice like a worn-out gramophone
record, “we are r-r-reformers, and have
come hither to save the ungodly.” I
suggested that his methods seemed to
lack vigor, whereat he opened a little
brown bag and offered ME a tract! Per-
haps he thought this last coup would alter
my opinions, but it didn’t. I still think that if
there is an ultimate to futility the U.8.P.F.,
etc., has struck it.

The farcical institution of Royalty spreads
its sticky tentacles far. A red baby is born in a
palace at Madrid, and all sorts of fool flummery
happen in its vicinity. But that is not all. All
over the world there are Spanish Consuls, who
must hold receptions because of the red baby.
To be Spanish Consul in any place outside Europe
is mostly a tinpot office, and any old cork-seller
will fit the job. Hence, in many a big city the
importer of corks last week held a cheese-and-beer
levee, what time the neighbor’s kids looked over
the garden fence, and sighed to see the hired
caterer mixing the sawdust and cream in the
rented glass dish.

‘ ‘ Lantana ” : How is this for the strenuous
female? Two of them—the Misses Lynch, of
Cympie, Queensland —put in an appearance at
the ivingaroy loading yards, and asked for work as
timber-cutters. They gave an exhibition of their
ability by chopping the ends off logs in a way that
made half the mere males cuss with envy. And
they were good-figured, smart, well-mannered
young women. A staggered boss asked them
how long they had been at the game, and they
answered that they’d been timber-cutting and
hauling since they were big enough to lift an axe.
That comic opera collision in the Sema-
phore roadstead (Adelaide), where the Arden-
craig sank the anchored Norma in the night, and
the Jessie Darling wrecked itself on the wreckage
in the morning, is making steady work for the
lawyers. The Ardencraig has had five writs
nailed on its mast, and they total £so,ooo—from
the owners of each ship, the officers and crew of
each ship, and the owners of the Norma’s cargo.

The recent collapse in calm weather of the
Bulli (N.S.W.) jetty was forecasted by one of the
workmen a whole fortnight before it happened.
Although these private shipping structures are
assailed by just as heavy seas as any other jetties,
and many lives depend upon their safety, they
are not liable to Government inspection. Yet the
risks warrant a whole lot of inspection. This is
the third accident at this one jetty. On the first
collapse four men lost their lives. The second
and third breakdowns didn’t kill anybody, but
that was pure luck, and both times the Devil
clawed for a number of men, and only missed
them by the diameter of his own tail.
The Lydiard-street Methodist Church bad not benefited
to the extent of one penny by the mission, while Miss
Ward would leave Ballarat with a respectable sum after a
ten days’ revival. —News Item.
She was his wife—a little bit of a woman
mostly hidden in bandages. Her nose was broken,
and her face terribly contused where the Brute
had struck her. Everyone in that Melbourne
police court was sorry for her. Everybody was
boiling with anger against him. The magistrate
was Samuel Lancashire, -J.P., whom the directory
describes as of “ Haw ” —the same being short
for Hawthorn. He looked angry, too. His
voice always sounds like a gate swinging on rusty
hinges in the wind, and it creaked worse than ever
now that he was angry. “ A man like you ought to
be ashamed of yourself,” said Samuel of Haw.”
“You ought to be put in gaol for six months.”
This was real magisterial wrath. A pleased un-
settled down on the court. At last a wife-beater
was going to be punished, and by Samuel Lan-
cashire, J.P. But alas ! Samuel’s voice started to
creak again—less noisily this time. “Fined £5.
in default one month,” was what he said, and the
court sighed, while the Brute smothered a grin
behind his dirty coat-cuff. Now, when Samuel
Lancashire says the case calls for six months, and
only gives one, isn’t Samuel thereby convicted out
of his own mouth—the mouth he habitually puts
his foot in—of being unfit for his position to tile
extent of 16s. Bd. in the £ ?
REJOICE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The English-speaking world will rejoice, in common
with the Spanish, at the announcement that an heir has
been born to the Spanish throne.— Argus IS/5J’O7
So here goes for a Rejoicing ode
Brothers, rejoice !
Lift up your heart and voice,
And make a very cheerful noise !
Excuse my rhymes ;
I took ’em from the Psalms of ancient times ;
And if my metre roams,
Remember that an incense-breathing Ode
Is not compelled to tramp a beaten road
Like other common pomes.
Therefore, my boys,
Rejoice 1
Rejoice, for the infant red,
Born in the royal bed !
For the flea-brained father, who skips to think
That he has helped to create that pink,
Round lump of matter,
Which causes a clatter,
Since
It’s a prince !
So drink
(Look back, and you’ll find this rhymes with pink)
To the honest Queen, who has done her share
In giving the Spanish throne an heir :
Mothers of boys,
Rejoice !
I’ll change my metre—as I said,
An Node has many tracks to tread.
Oh, let us bend the supple knee,
Oh, let us roll the loyal eye,
To greet this sprig of Majes-tee ;
To bail this seed of Royal-tie.
From more than ordinary madnesses,
Good Lord, dissever him ;
From measles and from all such sadnesses,
Good Lord, deliver him !
Among his hair, in ringlets braided,
Let not the hair-restorer e’er be needed :
Rejoice 1
Yea, we rejoice, we maffick,
We wave our arms and stop the traffic
All for the sake of the infant red,
Who lies in the Royal bed,
With smile seraphic !
We—(Here chips in
The Editor, a man of sin,
Declaring that this ode of art consummate
Has reached the limit!
Bad rhyme, damn it!) —
Yea, we—
(“ Will you shut up 1 ” —Ed. B.)
We now—
(“ your row 1 ”)
Well, anyhow,
Rejoice !

A wordy young man who had been prowl-
ing around Melbourne (since the Tote was ‘ ‘ sur-
rendered ”), delivering street-corner orations
against Ada Ward and Judkins in particular,
and professional purists in general, managed to
get himself arrested at Ballarat last week. In
Melbourne, seemingly, he never suffered any
inconvenience from the police till Judkins
described him as an outrageous scandal—
which he certainly was. The Judkins denuncia-
tion happened last Sunday week, with the
result that the notorious vituperator was advised
to shift his violence to another town. At the
Ballarat police court he stated that his mission in
life was to follow Ada Ward round the world, and
call her all the names he could think of in retali-
ation for her attacks on the theatrical profesh.
But seeing that the wandering libeller was equally
rough on Judkins, and “the parsons” and Anti-
Gambling Acts, it would be interesting to know
why he mixed his mission and where his wages
came from.
COMPENSATION.
“ It was a terrible shock to me when my doctor told me that I must positively give up my singing .”
“ Yes, to be sure. But just think what a relief it must have been to your friends."
The long arm. At Williamstown (Vic.), a
policeman, who was the tertium quid in the home of
the captain of a coaster, was discovered by the hus-
band, who was supposed to be tramping the
Tasman Sea in his schooner. The wife had
depended on the shipping news in the dailies, but,
when it was too late, she discovered that there
are two schooners of the same name trading on
the coast, captained by men who are of the same
name also. It was the news that the wrong
schooner was many wet miles away that had
filled her with baseless confidence.
VARIETY’S THE SPICE OF LIFE .
OLD LADY (sternly): “ That's not the same story you told me before.”
CADGER: “ No, kind lady, you didn’t believe the other one.”
A rare case lias happened in Melbourne
Divorce Court —a white girl has sued for separa-
tion from her Chinese husband. It is so rare a
thing that the Chow has got the name of being
“a good husband.” But this case probably
explains why. He took to opium and drink, and
yet she didn’t go down the hill with him. That
was the marvel of it. Mostly the Chow drags his
woman down to his level, and when they have got
to the bottom of the pit together such a small
thing as a marriage doesn’t count. Thus John
doesn’t figure in divorce ; therefore he is a “good
husband,” and B. Smith and King Cole mention
it among his virtues.
“Stony”: This Lord Mayor business is
having some unpleasant effects. A wild idea has
’ entered the august top-piece of a certain particu-
larly crude suburban mayoress. This dame has
been trying to argue her husband into persuading
the town councillors and officials of her princi-
pality to call her “the Lydy Mayoress” when
they are in conversation with one another, or with
outsiders who have business at the municipal
offices. She has already, it is said, had three
large rows with her lord and mayor over the
matter. The bee blew into this painful person’s
bonnet when the titular gaud arrived for Mel-
bourne’s municipal figure-head.

Whooping cough is a very dangerous
disease unless treated properly. Statistics show
that there are more deaths from it than from
scarlet fever. You cannot mistake the symptoms
—protracted coughing, worse at night—peculiar
sound or whoop—labored expectoration of mucus
—apparent suffocation after coughing. Give
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy at once, repeating
the dose frequently. The quick relief afforded by
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy makes it a favorite,
with mothers of small children. It liquefies the
tough mucus, making it easier to expectorate,
keeps the cough loose, and counteracts any
tendency towards pneumonia. This remedy has
been used in many epidemics of whooping cough,
and always with perfect success. There is no
danger whatever from the disease when it is freely
given. It contains nothing injurious, and may be
given as confidently to a baby as to an adult.*
There seems to be a terrific lot of Jess
drifting towards old spinsterhood in Melbourne,
and ready to answer any advertisement that
promises escape. On a recent Saturday the Age
had this advt. : —•
JESS, —Longing to hear from you. Advertise ad-
dress. X.Y.Z.
Aiid promptly, in one issue, the Age got these
advts. in reply :
XY.Z.,-- Address letter to Jessica, P. 0., Fitzroy.

'V'Y.Z., —If me, address care Miss Russell, Malms-
bury. Jess.
-Write J.E.W., P. 0., Collingwood. Jess.
■V'Y.Z., —Please call for letter to-day, N. Melb.
-X- P.O. Annie H.
You see, “Annie H.” isn’t exactly “Jess,” hut
perhaps “X.Y.Z.” won’t be so narrow-minded as
to notice a little thing like that.

While inquiring into the recent death of
a patient at Yarra Bend (Melbourne) Asylum,
Coroner Cole was staggered to learn that some of
the nurses were kept on duty from 8 p.m. till
7 a.m., and had to look after as many as 200
patients, out of whom (in one case) 96 were
“ specials ” who had to be visited at least once per
hour, and frequently turned in bed. It works out
that the nurse with that job was expected to
attend one patient every 38 seconds, and between
times keep an eye on the 110 other patients. The
department was apparently surprised to learn
what its nurses have to do, so it advertises for
more, at 13s. (id. a week and “ found,” rising to
19s. 3d. and “ found ” ; and no doubt it will
feel surprised if the billets are not rushed at those
kitchen-wench rates. But how quick the depart-
ment has been to notice this shameful sweating !
It is two years since Dr. Jones was imported—
there is a perfect mania for importing people—at
considerable cost, to reorganise this neglected
department, yet nothing is done till a coroner
calls attention to the horror. And if the coroner
hadn’t done it, the matter would probably have
drifted on till that other representative of the
dead, the undertaker, mentioned that things
weren’t quite right.

According to a yarn in Sydney Telegraph,
a clerk, a mere youth “weighing only nine stone,”
took quite kindly to coal lumping, and didn’t find
anything to grumble at: —
Now, in the third week, I feel quite at home, and am
proof against a falling block of coal upon my head, or a
severe bump from a 2121 b. basket dropped several feet
from above.
This from a nine stone youth ! The Bulletin
will only believe when it has personally dropped
2121 b. on his head.
One of Judkins’s spotters was beguiled by
the ungodly in a Melbournfe suburb one recent
Sunday. He was waited on in the morning by a
grave and elderly deputation of three strangers,
who told him of the shockingly barefaced manner
in which business was being conducted at a certain
hotel in a neighboring waterside suburb, and
urged him to keep an eye on it for the good of the
cause. The spotter visited the part affected,
camped for five hours in the vicinity of the sus-
pected pub, and kept a vigilant eye on the pre-
mises. Then he went and presented a sad report,
enlarging on the shameful manner in which the
“Sawbuth” was being violated at the place in
question. And this particular pub was unin-
habited, and there had been no beer on the pre-
mises for a month,

Brighton (Vic.), where T. Bent used to
collect the rates, is wrestling with the prol lem of
the consumptive in a new form. A while back a
man and his wife, both suffering from the disease,
got the owner’s permission to pitch two tents in a
local paddock, and dwell there—the couple in one.
their allegedly healthy children in another. It
wasn’t an ideal existence, but it was the best and
healthiest available. They hadn’t been there
long before certain of Brighton’s Very Best
People viewed these residences, and decided they
were abominations. Had they been made of
stucco or cement, with a large gate, and a fagade,
and a mortgage, and a lodge, and a dog-kennel,
and an acre of brass-plate, Brighton would have
welcomed them as ornaments to the locality, no
matter how much disease they sheltered. So the
Council urged the family Jto move—there were,
it said, some open spaces around Aspendale and
Carrum, not to mention the Mallee, where they
could camp. But the family said, between its
coughs, that it had neither money nor inclination
to hump its tents around like the Arabs, and
that, though there was a fair amount of space in
the middle of the continent, there was precious
little work thereabouts, and the family couldn’t
live on mere space. The matter stays in that
position at present, and Brighton is thinking
hard. It doesn’t like to shoo the family on
“ with force and with the strong arm,” lest it gets
into the papers ; yet it thinks that tents are a
blot on its putty and stucco township, and its
anxiety to point out what a splendid place any
other place is for some consumptives in a tent is
pathetic.

“ A. 8.” : It is curious how Sydney and
Melbourne criminals differ in their actions in
Court. In some points the distinctions are re-
markable. For instance, it is a rare thing for a
Victorian prisoner, committed for trial, to plead
guilty. There is probably not one plea of gui.ty
out of every 10 prisoners presented. In Sydnei ,
at the last Darlinghurst sessions, over 50 per cent,
of the accused threw in the towel. There is also
a marked difference in respect to the swearing-in
of juries. Not a single juror was challenged this
time at Darlinghurst, whereas, at any Melbourne
sessions, there is seldom a jury sworn in without
the prisoner having exhausted his right of chal-
lenge. The Sydney prisoner is wise in omitting
to challenge anybody, for the juryman who goes into
she box is almost invariably indignant that he
thould be chosen while somebody else was allowed
to depart. On the other hand, the prisoner shows
little common sense in pleading guilty. The man
who commits a crime in the presence of 20 police-
men ought to stick out that he was three miles
away at the time, and he will find one jury out of
three to believe him. You never know what a
jury will do till you try.

“ F.” writes :—Regarding the drapery-
trade, The Bulletin might have mentioned,
without dislocating its reputation for veracity,
that the Lassetters seem to be willing to treat their
employees a good deal better than most. It was
in the first instance by friendly agreement with
Lassetters that the Shop Assistants’ Union tried
to reform conditions in the business, and, accord-
ing to the evidence, Lassetters were willing to
allow a minimum wage of 50s. a week to men and
of 30s. a week to women. Not a gorgeous standard
certainly, but very fine when compared with 30s.

AHDERSON’S FAIRY TALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
According to Sydney Daily Telegraph, the one solitary
girl immigrant, brought to Australia as a domestic
servant, received seven offers of marriage on the voyage
out, and, on arrival, applied to the head of the Intelligence
Department, Mr. Anderson, for advice. According to the
same authority, that gentleman was still considering the
matter when it went to press.
She tired of her village, old and quaint,
And she tired of its people more,
And decided straight that she’d emigrate
To Australia’s golden shore ;
So she left the narrow, half timbered street,
That history largely fills,
In Bury-on-Sea St. Boshter’s,
In the heart of the Essex Hills.
Her style of dressing was out of date,
She spoke about “coom” and “nigh,”
But she measured forty around the bust,
And she had a laughing eye.
Her teeth, so white, would an anchorite
Tempt out of his cave—and this
Makes fellows stare, when a maiden fair
Has lips that are meant to kiss.
So there Were the cook an 1 the captain bold,
And the amorous midshipmite,
And the crew of the captain’s gig as well,
Awaiting their turn each night
To go on deck at her call and beck ;
And it was their daily plan,
To kneel and meet at the dainty feet
Of beautiful Mary Ann.
But she treated them all with the cool disdain
Of a queen in a court of old ;
She never as much as let them touch
The tips of her fingers cold ;
But told them all, as they gathered round,
When she stepped on the busy quay,
“ I shall take the one Mister Anderson
Decides is the best for me.”
So now they’re burning the midnight oil
In the depths of that busy “ dept.;”
And the clerks are piling up overtime
As the vigil long is kept.
Like the Chancellor, in the fairy play,
Mr. Anderson daily pants
O’er giving agreeable girls away
To suitable immigrants.

ROBEY’S
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Treasurer Peake, of S. Australia, is going to
have a surplus, too. But, not being a Reformer, but a
mere plain person whose Premier is a Labor member,
«ak® says in effect that, if the State accomplishes
deficits, the only way to get rid of them is by also occa-
sionally accomplishing' surpluses ; and as surpluses can
be accomplished with ieast hardship when times are good
and money plentiful, he proposes to accomplish one or
two now. Then when times are bad and taxation is a
burden, S. Australia may be able to afford to knock off a
lb. or two.
* * * *
The Maoriland Treasurer, whose year ends with
March, has produced a surplus of £1,492,825, out of which
he has already handed over £775,000, so he calls the
surplus £717,825. It would be quite as easy to call it
£917,825 ; and if he had called it that it really wouldn’t
have made any difference—he might have been able to
grab a halo two sizes larger, that is all. The fact is,
Maoriland has got a Public Works Fund ; and, instead of
using it to provide for works out of revenue, Maoriland
uses it to fake the accounts and make limelight and halos
politicians. Into this Works Fund both loan money
and alleged surplus revenue are thrown ; and because
some alleged surplus revenue goes into the Fund, no-
body takes much notice when things which obviously
ought to be paid for out of revenue are paid for out of
the Fund. Nowadays, therefore, practically anything
can be “ charged to the Works Fund ” —repairs of rail-
way lines and rolling stock and public buildings, patches
to lighthouses, dredging, cups and saucers for the tourist
places, cutting down a few trees so that the tourist may
have a better view of the lovely Maori maiden that you
see in the pictures, &c. “ Boads ’’ in 1906 were down
for a cool £352,204, and Defence is a public work, too.
bo you only have to pile a few more things on to
the heap that are paid for out of the Fund, and you
make so large a hole in the ordinary expenditure that a
surplus of surprising bulk is able to crawl through and
crow on the other side.
The only drawback to this system of manufac-
turing surpluses is that it doesn’t matter two straw's
whether the expenditure is transferred to the Works
Fund or not; it remains expenditure just the same.
Consequently, until you know what the deficit is in the
Public Works Pund account, it isn’t worth while knowing
what the alleged surplus is in the Ordinary Revenue
account. And up to the present there is a large vacancy
and an oppressive silence where the information regard-
ing the operations of the Works Fund ought to be.
The last time, a few weeks ago, that The
Bulletin made a few remarks regarding the fatal drift of
the Maoriland finances, Treasurer Hall-Jones, as a
counterblast, fired off a number of vague observations
about the State’s sinking funds. Now, sinking funds are
almost the last things that a Maoriland Treasurer ought
to mention. Many years ago, when Maoriland was
partially-honest and had an idea that debts were things
that ought to be paid, it did create a sinking fund. Then
along happened that brilliant financier Vogel, sniffing as
he went, and he scented coin in his need. What he
scented was the sinking funds, and he grabbed them, and
Maoriland Treasurers are grabbing them to this day and
calhng them revenue ! The process is beautifully simple.
P irst Maoriland raises about £65,000 for a sinking fund
then it pays the £65,000 into the sinking fund and calls the
debt that much less, then it issues £65,000 of debentures
and so adds that much back on to the debt, then it trans-
rs the £65,000 of debt to revenue and calls it revenue
then the £65,000 (and some more) is used through the
Public Works Fund for repairing something, but before
it goes into the Fund it is called “ surplus.” Thus before
it is done, the £65,000 is sinking fund and debt and sur-
plus and receipts and expenditure. It is a most enter-
taining juggle ; but, in the end, it boils down to this—that
Maoriland provides either its sinking fund or a portion of
its revenue out of loans. The loan over which this pretty
performance takes place dates back to 1870 ; since then
not one ordinary loan carries a sinking fund. The only
loans that do are the comparatively small things issued
in connection with land settlement and as aid to local
bodies.
It is about time S. Australia began to have its
suspicions regarding the permanence of those “perma-
nent” works into which it has poured Cohen’s coin. For
instance, its Marine Board lately asked the Australian
Government to restore the cable communication the
old “permanent and reproductive ” borrowed-m’oney
cable being about dead, between the Althorpe and Trou-
bndge shoals and lighthouses and the mainland. But the
department replied that the cable was costly, and there
was hardly any business, and, anyhow, in view of the
probable -early adoption of a system of wireless tele-
graphy, the proposition might very well stand postponed
tor a while.

Business continues highly profitable—always assuming
of course, that advances are being made on a basis which
will allow of a severe shrinkage in the value of securities
so that reserved profits may not presently have to be
drawn upon to make losses good. Assuming that the
profits are profits, this return is shown on the basis of
capital and reserves :
Sept., 1903.. £ll 14 0 p.c. Sept. 1905 ..£9 4 9dc

Mar., 1905.. 9 7 9 „ Mar., 1907 .. 9 310 ”
These profits are among the very best earned in Aus-
tralia ; the Bank of N.S. Wales showed last half-year
£7 9s. lOd. per cent. ; the Bank of Australasia showed
£lO 11s. lid. per cent. A high profit return orj this basis
may be chiefly due to either of two things: (1) heavy
charges in return for what may prove to be large risks •
(2) the severe writing down of securities. It is probable
that the high return in Westralia is mainly due to the
former of these. As long as that is recognised and pro-
vision made for it, well and good ; but in such a case it
has to be remembered what the reserved profits are for
they are the proceeds of high rates charged to meet large
risks. Said the acting-chairman at the shareholders’
meeting“ There has been a decrease in the output
of gold, but it may not be very material. We
hope for an improvement in the industry, and we have
faith in the goldfields of the State.” Optimism is good in
its place ; but the fact is that for the first four months of
this year the Westralian gold output was only 555,2420 z.
fine, as against 604,581 oz. in the same four months of 1906'
and 652,5390 z. in 1905 ; and that sort of movement must
soon tell on Westralia.
Meantime, having reserved a good proportion of
its profits, and having realised large premiums for its
later share-issues, the Westralian Bank’s position is
undoubtedly strong. Take this comparison :

Thus debts to the public aggregate' £2,37s,B44 : liquid
assets (£1,172,849) leave £1,202,995 to be paid out
of non liquid assets, and the latter total £1,766 320.
That means £1 9s. 4d. of non-liquid assets' for
every £1 of public debt not represented by coin,
public securities, &c. The chairman hints at a
issue of shares. The authorised capital is
£250,000, in 25,000 shares, of which 15,000 fully paid to
£lO (but with a reserved liability of £10) have been
issued. Even now the proportion of shareholders’ funds
to total advances is large (33 per cent., as against just
under 20 per cent, in the Bank of N.S. Wales): but Wes-
tralian circumstances are unusual—the bank there, for
instance, has a phenomenal proportion of free current
account money in its deposits, and that isn’t money that
can be relied upon, though a fair amount of it has to be
used to make the present advances. The increase of
shareholders’ money in the business is, therefore, some-
thing to be encouraged.

The reconstruction in 1904-5 was never clearly expressed
in the published accounts ; in the foregoing an attempt
a< ? e t 0 anal .vse the business. Of the amount
of £15,3/7 shown as written off, all, or nearly all was
directed to the item “ Ship property.” This stood in the
books at £57,964 on September 30, 1904 ; after the recon-
struction, and with the amount provided for wear and
tear out of profits in the following half-year, it appeared
as written down to £40,175 on March 31, 1905. In the
table above the profits are shown as net, an unknown
being provided for depreciation. At March
1906, old ship property stood at £39,800. Six months
was written down to £36,200-a reduction of
£3600 out of revenue, assuming that none of the propertv
was sold. At September 30, 1906, new and old ship
together stood at £43,488 ; now it stands at
£40,3/6—a reduction of £3112 in the half-year; and it is
probable that something was also paid meantime on
account of a new vessel. This comparison partly shows
the movement:—

So in two years the surplus of liquid assets has been
increased by £2087, of which £305 was new capital
leaving £1782 the net increase ; and, meantime, £7070
was shown as paid on account of a new steamer between
March, 1905, and September, 1906—what (if anything) has
been paid since is not disclosed. Taking the two items
together (£88o2), the amount (along with anything paid
out tor a new steamer in the past half-year) represents
the past two years’ provision for reserves and wear
and tear of vessels ; and £4OOO a year is something- like
10 per cent, on book value of ships. Of the assets
(book value) just over one-half are Treasury bills de-
posits, and other liquid assets ; and, while that ’may
reduce the shareholders’ risk of loss, it keeps earnings
comparatively low. If the landlord’s fist did not lie so
heavy on the South Coast, there might be freight enough
to call for the investment of this hoarded £45 000 In
vessels, which might earn 7or 8 per cent. At present it
is lying where it earns perhaps per cent.

The copper market is wholly responsible for the improve-
ment shown in the half-year’s figures. So far as output
goes, there has been an emphatic fall:—

£' ld A f ° r that again a fall in the grade of ore is responsible.
The Mt. Lyell ore (70 per cent, of the total) gave 0-77 per
cent, copper as against lf)l per cent, in the previous
half-year and 0*99 per cent. 12 months ago. North Lvell
ore value showed a shrinkage also, but not so pronounced
a one. The profit per ton of copper (assuming that the
whole profit came from that metal) was £74 10s 8d The
average price obtained was £lO6 9s. 3d. That means that
on the past half-year’s figures, the co. could work without
being out of pocket if copper fell to £3l 18s. 7d. per ton
That sounds comforting. Yet if the copper market had
not taken this jump, the results would have made some
shareholders anxious. Instead of £lO6 9s. 3d. the co’s
copper only realised £B5 9s. 4d. in the previous six
months. That means that £2l per ton more was got in
the last six months. Of the profit of £282,938, therefore
£79,716 was due to the rise in price. Put in another
way, bad the past half-year’s price ruled during the last
three half-years, these would have been the results :
Profit on Actual
£lO6 Ton Basis. Profit
Mar., 1906 .. £386,500 .. £267 795
Sept., 1906 .. 344,419 .. 251*095
Mar., 1907 .. 282,938 .. 282*938
The first column of figures illustrates what the shrinkage
in ore-value means ; and the second column shows how
the rise m the metal has saved the situation. But at the
back of that salvation lies the awkward doubt whether
the new price is permanent. As shown above, if the
market stood at £B5 which is as high as anyofle can
reasonably figure on—it would make a difference of
£79,716 in the profits.
Along with the shrinkage in value has come
also an increase in the still marvellously low working
costs at Mt. Lyell. This shows how much :

The total ore forwarded to the reduction works in the
past half-year was 203,594 tons, which was rather less
than the amount treated there ; and Is. a ton on that
runs to about £10,200 in the half-year. Still, they are
amazing figures. Broken Hill, to mine and concentrate
alone, docs well when it works at 18s. per ton ; and after
that the stuff has to be smelted. Wallaroo and Moonta
instead of being able to produce copper at £3l 18s per
ton, spent last year £B9 18s. But, then, Wallaroo didn’t
. have some gold and silver to pay part of the costs.
When Lyell amalgamated with North Lyell it had to
take over the latter’s debenture debt; and it has been
prelum# rid of it as fast as the holders have allowed. Like
this :

Sept., 1906 .. 45,220 31,500
Mar., 1907 .. 43,120 2,100
They only carry 5 per cent. ; yet for the last two half-
years they have commanded a premium. Not many
mining cos. run up against the awful hard luck of having
to pay more than 20s. for their lOU for £l. This little
piemium is reckoned in with the amount shown above as
written-off out of profits. The reserves, by the way, are
mostly liquid. Reckoning in metal on hand (price at
which it is valued not stated), the surplus over liabilities
(including debentures) is £554,348.
? ew est i nuite of ore reserves is made for
Dyell; but the new discoveries have made a change at
JNorth Lyell. Taking previous figures, less subsequent
extraction, for Lyell, the matter seems to stand
approximately like this

Total copper 40,410 tons
Six months ago the total copper worked out at 38,555
tons of which 16,910 tons represented the metal in
North Lyell ore then developed. But what it may cost
to get out the Lyell ore that can’t be worked by open cut
another matter. Putting costs to be borne by copper
at £35 per ton, then with copper selling at £B5 per ton,
the mine is worth £2,020,500 so far as developed. Add
surplus of liquid assets, £497,784 ; total, £2,518,284. At
wL vi' n ? arkefc yalues the concern at £2,880,000.
Whether £B5 is too high a valuation to take is a matter
ot opinion ; it is certain, however, that very few Austra-
lian copper propositions would come out of a calculation
like this so well. Many of them would show a market
valuation from 50 to 500 per cent, over any mine-value
figures that could be arrived at.

half-year’s profit £12,381 represents proceeds of
sale ol stored by-products, as against £6218 received in
the previous term. The position is a little complicated,
rirst the co. sold 100,000 tons of zinc tailings at 6s. per
ton, prompt payment, and previous credits have been on
that account. Then it sold 500,000 tons of similar by-
pioducts at ss. per ton, payment to be spread over some
years, ana it turned the total amount to be received into
a By-products Reserve account, totalling £120,714. Pay-
ments on this account have now been started, and the
amounts received are being treated as profit—which, of
course, they are, though they are profits realised out of
past production. At the same time credit is being taken
t 0r r i t 7*u- CU ' rent P r °duetion of by-products at Is. per ton,
and this is being treated as profit too. So for the past
two nail-years we get this division of profit:—

se ?,™ s fairly safe to take credit for current production
of tailings, slimes, &e., at Is. ; yet it is quite possible
that a time may come in the metal markets when it will
be impossible to treat them with anv profit at all. In
any case, in considering this eo.’s present profits, it has
to be remembered that they are being double-banked.
Generally the trend of things at B.H. Block 10
is only moderately satisfactory. The value of the ore is
not set out, but, from the data given, an attempt has
been made above to calculate it, and the figures ought to
be pretty right. Though the lead value is a bit better,
the silver is lower, and the downward movement in general
is pronounced. Add to that an increase in costs. The
general manager sets out costs of ore-raising and dressing
a,t 17/11-27 per ton ; but the figures put that way are
liable to mislead, since they don’t include plant and mine
maintenance, and mine development, and other expenses
The total working costs were £1 3s. 2Jd. per ton, as
against £1 os. 4jd. in the previous half-year. Meantime,
in spite of increased mill appliances, no improvement is
being made in the extraction, which amounts to but 37-06
percent, of the silver and 65-54 per cent, of the lead-
for a big mine the poorest figures on the field.
«■ * * *
Block 10 struck the lode at 1315 ft. a fortnight
ago, and has now a 13ft. body of ore there. Reckoning
however, only ore above 1215 ft., the manager estimates
the reserves at 702,000 tons. The profit on silver-lead
concentrates last half-year works out at 13s. 2d. per ton.
On that basis we get this :
702,000 tons at 13s. 2d £462 150
By-products sold (to be pai d for) ’.' ] 05’333
By-products to be produced,

By-products on hand at Is 14’165
Surplus liquid assets .. .. " 67^780
Total £682,428
That is £6 16s. 3d. per share. But lead averaged
£l9 12s. 10d. in the past half-year, and in eight of the past
16 half-years it has averaged under £l3. The output of
lead in concentrates was 6180 tons ; £5 per ton less for
lead (making lead £l4 12s. lOd.) would therefore have
reduced the current profit from £46,523 to £15,623, and
the same £7401 would have to come off it for wear and
tear. At £l4 12s. lOd. for lead, then the total value of
the concern would fall to £372,628 ; or £3 14s. 4d. per
share. Certainly there is the ore below 1215 ft. to be con-
sidered ; but against that there can be set the certainty
of many things going wrong at a property which seems
to be the very centre of the underground disturbances on
the Broken Hill lode.

years, for though 4s. in divs. was paid in 1899, during
the previous lead boom, the co. was then in only 100,OuO
shares ; the heavy losses in 1902 (£13,232 in the first half)
oom P elled the issue of the preference
stares. The te,™, 0 n which they were issued, after
great difficulty, show the desperate state to which the
h^,!ul?!: e , nl ', ed , UC mu- i n the past 10 years 17s. per share has
been distributed. The figures show what a gamble the busi-
ls' the mine is low-grade, except for irregular and
erratic bodies of lead carbonates confined to shallow
eptns. when the metal markets are low profits disap-
pear, and the stock is nearly unsaleable. When they
nave one of their periodic bursts, fair dividends are paid ;
and then the public, or part of it, thinking the fair profits
have come to stay, rush the shares sky-high. In 1895
shares got down to 3s. 9d. ; at the end of 1899, with the
“ “° om 0,1 > they stood at 295. ;at the beginning of
I9Uj they were down to 3s. ; last November, ordinaries
sold up to 365., m spite of the preference issue; now,
when the public has at last realised what a lot of flam
was talked about zinc, they are selling at 235.
If it is not kept in mind that Block 14 is wisely,
no doubt, rifling its carbonate reserves in order to make the
nest use of the high metal market, people who touch
Block 14 s are liable to get into trouble. Of the previous
half-year s net profit of £22,963, no less than £10,977 came
from carbonates. In that half-year 4094 tons were
delivered. In the past half-year 7206 tons were
dispatched. But for the latter term the revenue
from this ore is not shown separately—the whole
income is lumped. Probably £25,000 of the profit
wasfroin carbonates; that would leave 18s. a ton
profit from sulphides, and as in the previous half-year
tnis class of ore did not give more than about 7s.
per ton profit, the chances are that the above esti-
mate for carbonates (£25,000) is under the mark. As
the ore (carbonate) now in sight may be taken as 5000
to ? s "T t la t ls > less than five months’ supply at recent
rate of extraction—the importance of distinguishing
profits derived from the two classes of ore will be seen at
?i, nC f\.u tlie management isn’t too anxious
tnat the public should see it; otherwise why not give the
same details as were given before? With regard to
these carbonates, though only 5000 tons are in
Sl . It there is no telling what other bunches
„hem there are in the mine. Of sulphides,
186,240 tons are estimated to be in sight and available—
practically the same as at the opening of the half-year,
so that developments have about equalled extraction,
llieir value isn’t mentioned : just as well, perhaps, for
so much do values vary, and so much does the character
of the ore differ in the matter of ease or difficulty of
treatment, that such estimates are rarely worth much.
+ i- 6 u°']f ex P er j enc e at the mill has been much better
tins naif-year than it was in the one before ; the extrac-
tion ran up to 65-9 percent, of the lead and 41-7 percent,
of Hie silver. For comparison, the North got out 761
per cent, of the lead a nd 54’87 per cent, of the silver,
which illustrates what was said just now about the little
worth of assay values taken alone, since so much more
ca " )e ,^' ot . out of one ore than out of another. But
while i>i°ok l-l shows improved work, costs are still high
fs- 4'fid. per ton of ore handled, as against 17s. lid.
at the North and (including no less than 2s. lT9d. for
development) 17s. 11-Sd. at the South. These figures ex-
plain why Block 14 generally succumbs pretty early to a
slump in the metal market.

The Cobar (N.S.W.) mines, including J. Bull’s
new purchase, the Great Cobar, were thrown idle again
ion nu °' v * n £ t° a trouble with the engine-drivers:
lUO of them have one way or another thrown about 2000
men out of work. The Arbitration Act having been just,
ahout kdled, an attempt was made first to prevent
and then to settle this dispute by those voluntary
methods that the papers have been buttering up ever
since compulsory arbitration was proposed; and tie
™ methods have proved the fraud and failure
that they always have been.
* * * *
®°PPy» which J. Bull took over from the
Gallymout eight years ago, is about the best
N.b. Wales mining purchase the old gentleman ever
made. He paid 70,000 shares out of 117,150 ; and alreadi
lie has got back £204,807 in dividends, of which £54,45.1
was paid last year. Nearly all this has been done in four
years ; the works only ran part of 1901, arid in 1902 the
long drought stopped crushing for months. In 1905 the
dividends ran to 472 per cent. ; last year they were 45 per
cent, on an increased capital, 11,000 new shares having
been issued at £3 per £1 share. So far, to the end of the
co. s year (Dec. 31, 1906), 212,681 tons of ore had been
aJi/v 1 and the ore re serves were then reckoned at
I t° ns > as against 182,000 tons at the end of 1905,
and 170,000 tons at the end of 1904. Thus the co., in two
years, has paid 92J per cent, on its capital, and has 21,000
tons more ore developed than it had when those two years
started. But sulphides make up a larger proportion of
the reserves nowadays, running to about one-half of the
total; and a larger plant is eating up reserves faster
without making much difference to the profits, more
poor stuff being now mixed with the rich ore. The co.
lately heiped to promote floppy South, in 150,000 shares,
of which it took 55,000 paid-up ; this co. has started work
on what used to be the parent’s south block.
The Valentine mine, Tambaroora (NSW)
which has been purchased by a Mudgee lawyer, now has
15 men at work, and locally they hope that, the mine will
at Hast do something to dispel the awful gloom
which overshadows once-famous Tambaroora and its
brother in misfortune, Hill End. Judging by past per-
formances, the Valentine is only worth posting to an
enemy but one never knows, and Red Hill may once
again shed radiance over Golden Gully, the joss-house
and the various goats that comprise the principal
features of the Tambaroora landscape. Clemens and
party get an occasional good crushing out of blocks in
Hawkins Hill, and the Root Hog or Die, on the Mac-
quarie River, which persistent claim never quite dies,
though it doesn’t alvva.vs root, has again changed hands,
and is once more to he “developed.” The BigNu«get
mine, at Hargraves, after giving a praiseworthy example
° .i e /? dnua ; te tuning, which was expected to turn the
saddle-reef Hargraves country into a second Bendigo, has
sadly and mournfully closed down. Some day someone
will tiy perforating' Hawkins’ Hill with bores to see if
there is a recurrence of the gold at a lower depth, and if
there is not, Hill End can give up its present pretence of
being a mining towm, and go into business as a sana-
torium, or a cemetery, or something respectable.

/xT^ h w^ i - scovery . of tin at Mulyan, near Wyalong
(N.S.W.), is attracting some attention, and with develcp-
ment; and good prices it should be a valuable adjunct to
the Wyalong gold field. At present the biggest draw-
back is Mulyan’s remoteness. The ore is carted to Yal-
gogiin, 20 miles, for reduction, and the concentrates are
then carted to Wyalong, 25 miles, where they are en-
tramed to Cockle Creek for smelting. The prospectors
(Connolly and party), though working in a verv primitive
fashion, are meeting with fair results. From 43 tons ore
they got 27J tons tin concentrates, which yielded 24 bags,
assaying 69 per cent, of metallic tin, worth £ll9 per ton.
The net return after payment of carriage, etc., was £l2O
which panned out a little better than wag'es for the party.
This was the second crushing.
A batch of Sydney artists, sometime last year,
formed themselves—or somebody formed them—into a
co., to work the Quartz Ridge claim, on the Turon River
(N.S.W.). Up to now, no brilliant tilings have happened,
and, as things are shaping, the future doesn’t look pro-
mising. A hotch-potch plant has been provided, but
actual mining' work, according - to local accounts, is not
commensurate with other expenditure.

Treatment of Broken Hill tailings for zinc has
proved to be a problem within a problem. To get good
results from any of the processes now in use on the
Barrier is comparatively simple ; but to get those results
from any lot of tailings that conies along is quite another
matter. All the tailings dumps contain zinc, but each
dump has its own characteristics, and sometimes one
dump has about 10 characteristics in 10 different places.
That is why the Zinc Corporation has had such a lot of
trouble. Dumps were purchased from several mines,
each with its own extraction problem. But the Corpora-
tion didn’t know that at first. It thoughifthat if a pro-
cess would act successfully on one lot of Broken Hill
residues it wotild act on the lot. In the end it found it-
self in the position of the man who tried to strike a safety
match on his trousers—a very good match and very good
trousers, but still there was no light. This was so little
understood that a co. once purchased a sample lot of
tailings from one mine, conducted successful experi-
ments, and cheerfully bought a few thousand tons from

A new improved drill maker and sharpener is
superseding' the somewhat expensive method of sharpen-
ing drills by hand. The machine will be welcomed by all
mining cos., because the men are able to sharpen up to
about 140 drills an hour without trouble, consequently
increasing the output and reducing the cost, which secures
to the mines substantial benefit. These machines have
been supplied to leading mines everywhere by the makers,
Messrs. Word Bros., of San Francisco, who have ap-
pointed W. & J. Lempriere, of Melbourne and Sydney, the

The Dorset Bucket Dredging Company is
building a complete plant for its claim in Tasmania.
The dredge is to be capable of treating 3000 cubic yards
of material per day ; the buckets have each a capacity of
6 cubic feet ; and the tables have a surface of over 2880
square feet; the ladder is 66 feet in length between the
centres, and can dredge to a depth of 38 feet; al7 inch
centrifugal pump supplies the water to treat the material
in the sluice boxes, and in addition there is a 6 inch high
lift pump to operate on the nozzles : the material is dis-
integrated in a revolving screen, which is 33 feet long and
5 feet in diameter ; the machinery is supplied by power
from two 60 H.H.P. horizontal engines which are supplied
by steam from an externally fired multitubular boiler,
working under a pressure of 1501bs. to the square inch.
The p ntoons to carry the plant are constructed of
Tasmanian hardwood, and are 124 feet long by 40 feet
wide. To facilitate working at night the dredge is fitted
up with an efficient electric lighting plant. The whole
plant is the largest of its kind in the Southern Hemis-
phere, and is in the main being construct ed by the Austral
Otis Engineering Company, of South Melbourne, under
the supervision of Robert McLintock, Eng.neer, of
Dunedin.* M

above any other pipe. This pipe possesses enormous
bursting strength, and is protected, inside and out, with a
perfect coating manufactured from asphalt. Asphalt
coated steel pipes have lasted from 25 to 40 years without
any sign of decay, and may last as long again. Spiral
pipe is manufactured by Mephan Ferguson, at Wanganui,

another mine altogether. Then it found out that
its match would only strike on its own box. The granu -
tion process seems to be the least particular o
all the wet processes tried on the _ Barrier,
and the Zinc Corporation is gradually training it to
assimilate a variety of foods. Considering the sort of
plant which the Corporation has had thrown together on
the British mine, the results now being obtained by the
Cattermole process are encouraging. And the corpora-
tion has another iron in the fire—the Elmore vacuum
process.
* * * *
Though ore-treating processes have a habit of
going wrong when they are lifted outside the laboratory,
the Elmore system, which has lately been under trial at
Broken Hill, promises all right. Elmore certainly has
one failure behind him ; years ago the British B.H. had
some hopes of an oil process which he then had in hand,
but it wouldn’t answer. Present idea is a modification
or extension of that —the vacuum oil process, based on
the varying capacity of oil to lay hold of the different ore
particles. In the London experiments as much as 90 per
cent, of the zinc is said to have been got out. For six
months tests for the purpose of settling details have been
in progress, mostly at the old Australian (German) Metal
Co.’s works ; and the first sizeable plant will be put up
at Pinnacles —a district which, though one of the oldest
on the Barrier, has had too many metallurgical troubles
to come to the front. J. Bull owns the parent mine
there. The Zinc Corporation also has some sort of call
on the Elmore idea.

Isn’t it time the Broken Hill New White
Leads, Rising Sun, and Globe mines awoke to the fallacy
of for ever following 2ft. seams of sulphides, which are
like will-o’-the-wisp-, and lead to nothing? If sinking
cannot be relied on after all this prospecting, then what
is the good of the mines, anyway ? At their present depth
there is nothing in any of the Broken Hill “ outside ”
shows strong enough to raise the wind necessary to fly a
kite; but there are indications in some of them that
something payable might be found at depth. Diamond-
drilling, under the circumstances, is little better than
drawing lots.

Broken Hill <Tunction North for the April four
weeks treated 2772 tons ore for concentrates valued at
£7551. Including £746 spent on development, and
depreciation (£277), expenses were £6237, leaving a profit
of £1314. That means 9s. 7d. per ton. But besides the
costs mentioned, £2185 was spent on capital account ;
and whether the charges for development and depreci-
ation represent a fair proportion of the expenditure which
has hitherto been incurred on capital account cannot yet
be tested. The result (9s. 7d.)per ton shows a substantial
improvement on the last report; but costs (£2 55.) per
ton are still excessive. The North, next door, last half-
year worked at 17s. lid. per ton. To pay a div. of 2s. 6d.
per share per quarter this co. must make a profit of
£7500 a month—as much, that is, as the gross value of
the last four-weeks’ output.

There is another row among- the management of
the B.H. Junction North ; and “Cobar” Hogan, one of
the directors, and reputed to be the holder, one way and-
another, of about 20,000 shares, refuses to accept the
half-yearly report issued by the Board, it is a beautiful
row altogether, which began when the North, next door,
wanted to get hold of the Junction North, and was
blocked by Sydney holders. From that moment there
was war between two factions, wherefore things that
would be passed over under ordinary circumstances,
became important as affecting one faction or the other.
The faction that wanted the North to get the Junction
North has, since its repulse, been a Junction North bear,
and Hogan’s idea is that the report helps the bears. Inci-
dentally he mentions that three of the Melbourne directors
have only a qualifying 200 shares each, which probably ex-
plains why they don’t share director Hogan’s exuberant
optimism. The Sydney crowd, now that it owns two-thirds
and more of the mine, could shift the management from
Melbourne, if it wanted to; but a good many holders,
knowing what a poor mining market Sydney is, don’t
want to snap the link with the Melbourne gamblers.
Still, as the shareholders’ meeting will be held on the
29th, and, as the Oobar warrior will be there with a
barrow-load of proxies, anything may happen. Mean-
time, the plans issued with the Junction North report
are worth studying. There is certainly no sign there of
that mine’s lode getting back towards the North at a
depth, as the North had hopes that it would.

The Lobb’s Hole Central comes on the skirts of
Horton and Freeman’s Lobb’s Hole float. The property
has been worked a little under the name of the Sonoma,
but promptly changed its name on the success of the
other market venture. Other shows are being taken up
or turned over in the district; and the public is likely to
be invited to buy some more Lobb’s Hole Extendeds,
etc. And the public will need to remember one or two
things: especially that the district is so inaccessible
and the veins generally so small that only very rich
ore can be looked at. Reeckman and Forsstrom, who
worked Lobb’s Hole for years, dumped 6 and 7p.c. ore on the
surface, and thought it was so little worth taking care of
that they dumped it where hundreds of tons of it were
washed away. Ordinary figures, therefore, don’t apply
to Lobb’s Hole district. The new co. has taken over the
parent concern, and is getting to work promptly. There
is the ore waiting to come out, and the co. will waste no
time getting it out to catch the present boom-market.

Tingha Tin Dredging Co., which is the profit-
able little Inverell (N.S.W.) concern, and not the pre-
tentious Tingha Consolidated Tin Mines that London
formed last year, made a profit of £3642 in the past six
months, against £3470 in the previous term. The No. 3
. dredge, started during the last few months, added only
£l5 to the profits—£ls out of a production of £1143.
The co., whose contributing shares are now paid to 3s. Bd.,
distributed £1250 (sixpence per share) in divs., and also
bought the third dredge out of profits; and in the pre-
vious term it distributed 3d., and paid for No. 2 dredge.
Up to now Is. 6d. has been paid in divs. since December,
1905, and two dredges, costing together about £5OOO, have
been bought, and there was £422 in hand on May 4. No. 1
dredge, which made only £1173 of the profits last half-
vear, has some fine ground ahead of it now ; No. 2,
which in eight months has paid for itself, has a shade
poorer outlook for the next six months.

Exit the Leviathan, Maryborough (Vie.). Plant,
one of the best for its size on the eastern slope of Aus-
tralia, was sold off for £5400, which should pay the bank
its mortgage. Mining at the claim was under
Nicholas, sen., who, in addition to his alluvial
reputation, added lustre to his name as a quartz
man by the way he ran this show. The defect
lay not in management, but in the poverty
of the stone. The co. milled over 110,000 tons for an
average of about sdwt., and got £120,000 worth of gold.
Sinking went to over 900 ft., but the stone there fell
away to under 4dwt. So the stamps had to be stopped.
Never a dividend was paid. That the mine was not given
over without fair trial is proved by the last full year’s
work, when 247 ft. of sinking and nearly 400 ft. of cross-
cutting and driving were carried out. J. Bull has never
had a straighter run for his money than that given by
the Nicholases, father and son.

Chalk’s No. 3, Carisbrook (Vic.), is a mining
curiosity in a double sense—firstly, as a mine that got a
£5OOO grant from the State and repaid it; secondly,
because it got into the div. list after £236,000 had been
gobbled up in mine work. Capital paid up provided
£78,000 of this sum, and gold won represented £158,000.
How the money has gone is shown by the following table,
which should be pasted up on the bedpost by those
devout deep-leadites who want a little fen or added to
their prayers
Wages .. .. •• •• £59,152
Contract labor .. .. • • 51,545

Props and laths .. .. •• 17,077
No. 2 plant .. . •• *4,115
Ironmongery .. .. • 9,125
These items represent £225,000; and, considering that
the mine has been at work for a dozen years or so, it is
clear that not very much cash has been allowed to go in
office trimmings or directors’ fees and frills. The Baillieus
and Tom Harvey once were backers of Chalk’s 3, but
they are reported to have learnt a trick or two better
than punching away at the water in a deep-lead mine.
No. 2 shaft and plant are the salvation of the claim, for
the water is beaten in the lower workings, and a good
block of the gutter has been proved off No. 2 rise. This
will help while the work is being opened up lower down
the lead. The co. did good work last half-year, mining
10,695 fathoms for 64020 z. This gave about £4500 over
working expenses. Roughly, costs panned out at 40s. per
fathom, thus driving'another nail into the coffin of the
statement that deep lead work in Victoria costs 14dwt.
(£2 175.) per fathom.

Twelve months ago the group of Diamond Hill
mines, at Bendigo, were boosted on the share market by
a crowd that knew not the little ways of the Golden City.
Those ways are to sell high and buy back low when the
chance comes, and at all times tobe prepared to pay calls
into any local decent show. When the record of what has
been dons by the mines on the line, from the New Chum
Goldfields down to the Goldfields Extended, is read,
the slender fabric on which the “jig” was danced
is onlv too plain. Thus there have been calls
totalling £35,800 by eight Diamond Hill cos. Gold of the
value of £16,213 has come out of the Newchum Gold-
fields, £5700 out of the Consolidated, £6OO out of the
North, and nothing out of the rest. Plans Were pub-
lished to show how the saddles pitched from the one
claim into the other. These were interesting, but they
didn’t help the investor a scrap, except to keep him
awake at night thinking over the kindness of the men
who could thus show him that he was on the high
road to wealth. Now that he finds he has to trudge
along a dusty and prickly path with no shady bowers, he
wants to hit with a hatchet those that boosted the shares
and the fellow that painted the Diamond Hill in the
gaudiest of gaudy yellows. New Chum Goldfields has
certainly got on to the div. list with a shilling, but the
mine wants hard development. Then, too, it must
not be taken for granted because the New Chum
is on gold that the shoot extends into the next
claim or the one beyond. A thought of that kind
gets into the head of people outside Bendigo, but there
are shoots and shoots. Nowadays the majority of them
seem to be short, especially at depth. The indications
at Diamond Hill are that the saddles are neither so large
nor so rich as in the older mines. This statement will
onlv be proved or disproved by further work, but the
outsider had better let Bendigonians do that, confident
that they will do it well.

The old Canico claim, Carngham (Vic.), has
been purchased by the Buchanan crowd, for flotation into
a new co. of 32,000 shares of 10s. Former yields ranged
from 9dwt. to 16dwt. ; and from March, 1881, to March,
1891, 2690 tons yielded 1286J0z Prospectors have been
paying much attention to Carngham lately, and the
Canico float seems pretty well assured.

Associated, Kalgoorlie, gives the market plenty
of excitement, and provides the dealers with a fairly
steady job. A little while ago there was the discovery
of rich ore in the north-east corner, in the underlay of
the North Boulder’s Friday lode. After that, rich ore
was cut by a bore in the Australia East lode ; but, when
a crosscut was sent after it, only a patch was found.
Rich ore has now been reported in the Oroya shoot at
1400 ft. But it takes all these rich patches to sweeten up
the general average to about 40s. per ton. To show the
amount of dead work that has to be done, the cost of
development last month was Bs. 3d. per ton, while, on
such mines as the Horseshoe, Kalgurli, Gwalia, and South
Kalgurli, it was about 2s. 6d., and none of the other lead-
ing mines spent above 4s. At present, the co. is only
earning about 2s. 6d. a year on its 495,000 odd shares, ex-
clusive of depreciation and London exes., so that future
possible developments are heavily discounted when the
price rises to 20s. There are no more than about three
years’ reserves in sight, and even that is a far better posi-
tion than the co. has occupied for years. In the six
years (1901-1906), the co. paid 10s. 6d. in divs. ; so that
the annual average for that period was rather less than
the 2s. 6d. per share which is now being earned.
• * * «
Brown Hill Extended, Kalgoorlie, is now said
to have about 70,000 tons of reserves, of an ex-
tractable value of 40s. per ton. Judging from the last
three months’ returns, during which time the co. has
been crushing at the North Kalgurli mill, the value is
over-estimated, as the returns have been 235. Id., 325. Id.,
and 30s. sd. per ton. If the reserves are correct, the
mine should be equipped with its own treatment plant,
instead of wasting the best part of 10s, a ton on cartage
and hire of a mill. On the total reserves, these items
alone would pay for the purchase and erection of an up-
to-date plant. The North Kalgurli’s turn-out could pro-
bablybe got cheap, as that co. is not likely to work
again, and the ground will probably be absorbed jointly
by the Kalgurli and Hainault, both of which are badly
hampered for want of space on the surface.

Bayley’s, Coolgardie (W.A.), after a very
checkered career, has been sold by auction, and fetched
the miserable sum of £2760; this was for 100 acres of
leasehold and the entire equipment. This is a come-down
for a mine once valued, including outside shows since
absorbed, at over £1,000,000. For years past the ground
has been merely bottled up, though the whole north end
of the property is practically virgin ground. The new
purchasers, who are said to be all or part of the old co. in
disguise, are letting the show on tribute ; and they will no
doubt do better at that than by working it any other
way. The reef is so patchy that it will possibly never pay
aco., but fossickers may occasionally strike rich patches.
« * * *
Golden Ridge, Boorara (W.A.), is in a much
more satisfactory condition than it has been for a long
time past. At the end of June, ore reserves were given as
24 000 tons, worth 275. per ton ; but recent crushings,
since the change of management, have panned out well
over 40s. a ton, and have shown a monthly profit of £4OO
on an average output of 800 tons. The ore reserves are
now reckoned to be more than sufficient to keep the
20-head mill running full time. The Golden Ridge leases
have been abandoned, and all work is now concentrated
on the Waterfall, 3£ miles to the south. The mill is being
dismantled and removed, and it is expected that a profit
of at least £6OO a month will be earned when it is
re-erected. The co. is in 31,200 shares of £1 each, of which
26 000 are issued ; and on this it is expected that regular
divs. of at least 20 per cent, yearly will be distributed,
and will commence shortly. The deepest workings are
at 300 ft., but the shaft is now being sunk to 400 ft. The
financial position of the co. is not strong, but the avail-
able means ought to be sufficient to carry the mine
through. „
It looks as though Princess Royal, Norseman
(W.A.), will again be run by Capt. Treloar, who took
charge’of it in 1899, when things were rather gloomy, and
didn’t leave it till he had paid thousands in divs., and
raised scrip from 10s. to 455. or thereabouts. Manager
Henderson has resigned, after having done about the best
practical work that Norseman ever saw, but unfortunately
he struck nothing. The reef is a very peculiar one, and is
thrown about in a remarkable way. There are two gold
shoots, with a big blank between. The north shoot is
broken and patchy, and most of the gold came from the
southern one. Treloar is tackling a forlorn hope, as the
scrip, is unsaleable, and the mine ditto;, but he has
theories, and if they prove correct, he will earn the
gratitude of a good many plungers in Adelaide, and
pocket no end of shekels ; while if they prove delusions,
nobody can be much the worse. Shareholders can safely
reckon on getting a run, and on being speedily put out
of their misery if the mine is a has-been.
Sandstone Development, Black Range (W.A.),
in which the people who frequent Sydney University
Club are deeply interested, is being energetically pro-
spected. On the leases adjoining the Oroya Black Range
two shafts are now approaching 200 ft., but have still a
good way to go before they can hope to cut the underlay
of the reef. On the Wirraminna lease, very good stone
has been got in sinking the winze, and it has been decided
to have a test crushing of 200 tons to see how it pans out.
The peculiarity of this property is that the lode samples
and assays very badly, yet various parcels treated, aggre-
gating 400 tons, have averaged 14dwt. per ton. These
shares are rarely quoted, and no booming is done, as the
mine is being run to earn dividends, and not for market
purposes.
* * * •
Callion, near Davyhurst (W.A.), has replaced
Whitford’s Reward, now defunct. Very little work has
been done during the formation of the new co., but
steps are being taken to push things ahead. The stone
in the winze below 120 ft. assays 745., and is very heavily
mineralised. Both in the winze and in the new main
shaft the rock is too hard for hand drilling, and rock
drills are to be installed. To push on developments and
properly equip the mine, it is nearly certain that monthly
calls of 3d. will be made. Threepence per share should
realise £825 monthly, and enable the mine to be quickly
opened up and equipped.
9 * * *
Golden Pole, Davyhurst (W.A.), is still looking
a bit better. The southern crosscourse, which completely
cuts off the pay shoot, has now straightened up from an
angle of 22£deg. to 30deg. At this angle the two cross-
courses will not meet till nearly 1000 ft., whereas if the
old angle had been maintained the bottom would h .ve
been reached at 700 ft. Fifteen head of stamps are now
running, so that the May output should show a marked
improvement over that of April.

“Avogadro”: Early this month an accident
occurred at one of the Murchison (W.A.) mines involving
the death of three men. One of them was leaning a little
too far over the cage, and his shoulder struck the top of
the platt, with the result that he was hurled against the
other three men in the cage. Two of them were thrown
out, and fell about 300 ft., and of course were killed. At the
inquest a juryman asked the Mining Inspector if sliding
doors ought not to be used to prevent any man who
might slip in the cage from falling out. The inspector
replied that he did not think it practicable, as the door
might be left open and get broken. Evidently a wooden
door is of more value than human lives. I have per-
sonally had experience of two other instances involving
the death of two men, where some such provision as
above suggested would have prevented the accidents.
The least slip by any man in a cage means death, as his
body is bound to strike the timber at the sides of the
shaft, and almost invariably he is then dragged off the
cage.

The April return from the Chillagoe (Q.) copper
furnace showed 1619 tons of Chillagoe ore, which gave
approximately £4 2s. 9d. per ton (taking copper at £lOO
and silver at 2s. 6d.), and 276 tons Mungana ore, which,
on the same basis, was worth £l6 7s. 4d. per ton ; and the
lead furnace put through 1012 tons Mungana ore, worth
about £3 16s. lOd. per ton. The value of the copper re-
covered from this lead ore is uncertain ; the average
assay of the ore has been officially given as 15 per cent,
lead, Boz. silver, 2 4 7 per cent, copper, so the copper asso-
ciated with the lead may be worLh from 30s. to £2. Gross
value of Mungana copper, lead and silver for a month’s
run may be estimated at from £BOOO to £9OOO ; so a profit
of about half the value of the output is required to equal
2s. per share (£50,000) a year. Mungana ore is nearly four
times as valuable as that from the Chillagoe mines, but the
latter includes a quantity of low grade fluxing material,
and although Mungana mines also produce large quanti-
ties of fluxing ore, they are not accounted for in the
smelting return—probably they just about pay for mining
and carriage.

O.K. copper mine (N.Q.) is picking up again.
It was at one time badly over-valued ; then, when it was
found that, in the struggle to pay divs. on its absurd
swag of 337,450 shares, it had neglected development
work, the public jumped to the conclusion that develop-
ment had been neglected simply because the management
had no confidence in the deep levels. So it was black-
guarded just as heartily as it had been exalted previously.
The best certificate the mine has had is that Richard
Shepherd, late of Lyell and Morgan, took the manage-
ment when things were gloomiest, and has stuck to it.
Good copper men are exceedingly scarce in Australia, so
Shepherd, a man with a first-class reputation, certainly
isn’t tied to O.K. When Dr. Jack reported in October
last he measured enough ore to be worth from Bs. to 9s.
per share in profits ; and copper had not then taken its
jump. Since then smelting has been stopped till the
last month by the North Queensland wet season; now
about the old value of ore (10 to 11 per cent.) has
been put through in the first month’s run. While the
smelter was shut down work went on underground, and
surface improvements were pushed on ; and new bodies
were prospected for by drill. The chief find so far is at
a depth of 300 ft. below the tunnel level. As the deepest
level from which ore has been mined so far is the 150 ft.,
the proving of ore at 300 ft. looks important; but size and
values have yet to be determined.
* * * #
Dalziell’s (N.Q.) are in better favor again, be-
cause the report for half-year ending March 31 showed
a credit balance of £5876, and the last crushing was an
improvement. Poor as the yield was considered, it
resulted in a substantial profit ; 2162 tons of tin stone
produced 70 tons 15 cwt. concentrates, averaging £B9
2s. 2d. per ton. The mine was managed with economy,
and the carting and milling charges were much more
reasonable than with ordinary customs ore ; hence a
profit of £3653 was realised from ore that did not quite
average 3J per cent, black tin. Generally speaking, the
open cut and underground workings are looking better ;
but the proved reserves of ore are insufficient for a co. of
this size, and the pipe of ore has not been cut in the
tunnel. Still there is a fair amount of payable ore in the
shallow ground, and as the mine expenses are under 13s.
per ton, and the company is now carting its own ore,
there is a reasonable prospect of an early dividend. How
many more dividends are likely to follow that early one
is another matter.

The Argylla looks as if it would be the boss lode
of the Cloncurry field ; very wide and very rich on the
surface, and the Argylla Freehold has 2000 ft. of outcrop.
Now the Argylla North, one of the leases of the West
Cloncurry Copper, Ltd., has struck the lode on its hang-
ing wall side in a westerly crosscut, slft. from the 100 ft.
plat. All that 54ft. was in pyritous quartz, with splashes
of copper sulphide. From 54ft. in the developments were
4in. sulphide, 15in. cupriferous kaolin, 9ih. sulphide, 12in.
kaolin, and 12in. quartz and gossan to the face —58ft.
The 4ft. of ore bulked 7'2 percent, copper, and apparently
the main ore body is on the extreme footwall. The West
Cloncurry has surrounded the 40 acre freehold recently
floated by Coats and Co. as the Queensland Copper
Freeholds, Ltd., and the outcrop is continuous to the
North and South leases of the first-named co.

Partly on the results of the drilling, partly on
the reports of Manager Wainwright, of the Broken Hill
South, and others, the mostly-Melbourne syndicate has
made up its mind to exercise the option it has over the
old Kapunda mine (S.A.). There is no question about the
necessary money : the crowd has plenty of that at com-
mand. David James, who happened to be station-con-
tracting near Broken Hill when that mountain of metal
was struck, and became an “ original,” owns most of the
Kapunda freehold. He ought to have probed the old
mine long ago. But he is no prospector ; mining has done
a lot more for him than he will ever do for mining.

Apropos the antimony market, which recently
moved up fast from, say, £4O to £l2O per ton, then during
the last couple of months slumped badly, but is now re-
covering. Discussing the question (April 25), The Bul-
letin said the rise was probably due to extra demand for
anti-friction metal and for use in certain ammunition.
In an American technical journal a new use is described.
“Both the Italian and French Governments are en-
. couraging the use of antimony pigments, which have
the advantage over white-lead of being innocuous, and
over zinc paint of being permanent and sun-proof.” The
biggest producer (smelter) is the Soci6t6 Anonyme Franco-
Italienne. Formerly this co. produced regulus alone;
now its Italian works make no metal, but only pigments,
and the French works are reducing the output of metal
and increasing the output of paints. The American writer
says the output of Ore is' not diminishing, but is of lower
value; and “ unless fresh and large sources of supply
should drown the market with ore, the prices will probably
be maintained for some time to come.”

“Toohey ”: Dredging is almost as exciting as
butter-making; but things do happen sometimes. At
Wandiligong, Bright district (Vic.), for instance, one
man—call him Brown —applied for a dredging lease, but
was beaten by another party. The latter forthwith
erected a dredge ; but meantime Brown, being the holder
of the water rights, dammed back the creek above the
dredge. The dredge people were then in the position of
not having enough water for continuous work. Some-
body interested in the dredge attempted to break the
dam. Hearing of this, Brown rushed violently to the
spot, with as many men as he could gather on the
journey. The other party was about to use a pick when
Brown arrived. The latter tore off some clothes, and his
men behind him ranged up in battle array. This dis-
mayed the dredge-men, and they retired in good order
without a single gun being fired. Now the dam is being
guarded by three shifts of two men each, while the dredge
has stopped working. Much beer is being consumed,
while Wandiligong is worked up to fever heat, and the
next act is anxiously waited for.

“ Swamper ” : Just a word re the appear-
ance of frogs and such-like at intervals. 1 notice
most of your “Abo” writers have an idea that
the sudden and unaccountable frog only arrives at
the same time as a shower of rain. But I know
of one case where froggy put in an appearance in
countless numbers and full size on a dry day. The
event happened in Perth. The batrachians were
in such numbers in the streets, on the footpaths,
and in the houses, that one could hardly take a
step without treading on one. Some of them
were as big as the palm of a man’s hand. Whence
they came, or where they went, no man knoweth
to this day. There is another unaccountable
visitant in the mulga country of the eastern gold-
fields of Westralia. After a shower of rain large
snails happen, shells and all. They are about
fin. in diameter. I have dug up the shells in
alluvial ground from a depth of 4ft. or sft., but
have never seen one with a live snail in it, except
on the surface and after rain. As these snails are
never found in the lakes or swamps, it is hardly
possible that they were lifted up in waterspouts
and distributed over the land. That theory may
hold water, but it won’t hold snail.

“ Flinderino ” : Re Narracoorte caves and
the petrified blackfellow (B. 9/5/’O7). “Brice
Burn ” is in error when he states that the body is
still in the cave. I was recently inspecting the
caves, and came upon a small heap of bones on a
ledge of rock partitioned off with half-a-dozen
iron bars. This marks the spot where the mummy
was found. The local Ferguson informed me that
at the time of the shooting affray the only person
who knew of the existence of the caves was the
blackfellow, who crawled in there to die. The
body was not found until many years later,
when a party of whites explored the great natural
orifice. The question arose as to what should be
done witli the mummy, and some wanted to put it
in the Melbourne museum. It was, however, de-
cided that Binghi should be cemented into the
crevice where he was found, and so be an object
of interest to tourists. This was done, but a few
days later the body disappeared. Someone
had stolen it. All efforts to trace it failed until a
couple of years later, when it was said to be on
view in a museum in England. The bones now in
the cave are those of a sheep, and have been put
there just for effect.

The old man started guiltily. The exuberant joy of
finding the long-lost son (and, incidentally, some badlv-
wanted cheap labor for the farm) had caused him to
almost forget the careful habits of a lifetime.
“ Did yer burn th’ brand ? ” he demanded hastily.

harassed these times by the prowling dingo and

So bad is the dingo nuisance that settlers have
been driven to the ancient practice of yarding
their flocks at night; and even then it is neces-
sary to keep watch, as often, if the sheep are un-
watched, the prowlers jump over the fence or get
between the rails, and make matters gory. Some
time back, the experiment of driving was tried at
Bailey Park, but was quite unsuccessful. The
dingo knows a trick worth three of that; while
the drivers go by, he just sits in his lair and
reflects. Most of the animals are domesticated
dogs that have taken to the bush and learned to
fraternise with the wild element. As for the
grasshopper, he eats everything in front of him,
and, for the matter of that, on all sides of him,
and the cocky is praying for John the Baptist to
come and eat the grasshopper.

“J.G.”: It is about time that the Yic.
Shire Councils were prevented from being such
glorified asses as they are over the noxious weed
question. Under the Thistle Act any plant, from
half an inch to 400 ft. high, can be proclaimed a
thistle, and then the Shire Councils can see that
it is destroyed—but don’t. The best part of
Victoria is being overrun with thistles, stinkwort,
St. Jolin’swort, and Heaven knows how many other
sorts of devastating trash. At the end of last year,
when the thistles were seeding copiously, and the
stinkwort was beginning to grow rapidly, the
councils yabbered a lot about having to enforce the
Thistle Act as far the thistles were concerned ;
but, as the thistles had seeded, it was decided that
it was then too late to have them cut. Not a
word was said about the stinkwort, which was
just ready to cut. Now the stinkwort is scatter-
ing millions of seeds broadcast over the country,
and councils are barking about enforcing the
Thistle Act as far as the stinkwort is concerned.
Then it is stated that, as the wort has shed its
seed, it is too late to do anything this year. If the
Government does not take the administration of
the Thistle Act out of the hands of the country
municipal eouncils, it will be a bad lookout for the
small cockies and settlers, whose land will ulti-
mately be rendered as valueless to them as Sahara.
The thistles and other noxious weeds are raised on
the squatters’runs, and spread likethedeviloverthe
neighboring land, until it is impossible to harvest
any crops except thistles and stinkwort; and a
cow would starve on a thousand acres of stinkwort-
infested land.

“Old Flick” (who sends no address at
which the cheque can be applied for): Be homing
instinct of horses. Any horse on God’s earth will
make a bee line for home, provided home is
sufficiently attractive. The general custom, on
arrival, is to give him a whack with the bridle,
and turn him out to feed on jam tins and scraps
of fencing wire. The result is that he doesn’t go
home. Why should he? Now I have seven
horses. They are well fed and looked after—in
fact they are pets; and lam willing to let
“ Duroc,” or anyone else, take them 20 miles from
home, in seven different directions, and, if they
are not home in five hours, I will give £5O to

concerned, gates or sliprails in the way won’t
matter. He can padlock them if he likes, as long

“ Brumby ” : “ David H. Richards’ ”
assertion (B. 25/4/’O7), that the horse is possessed of
remarkable intelligence, gives me a pain. The
spectacle of half-a-ton of horse-flesh snorting with
dread at a piece of paper lying in the road isn’t
calculated to encourage faith in this alleged
intelligence. Even after the piece of paper has
been formally introduced, and he is persuaded to
sniff at it, he continues to view it with suspicion.
For months I drove a prad once weekly over
a long suburban road. About every 100yds.
there was a circular cover over a sewer
man-hole. During all that time the stupid moke
never once failed to shy violently at these objects.
That well-known ease of a mine horse starving to
death a few yards from the main shaft in a blind
drive, because he had wandered in and couldn’t
get out, is another instance of the animal’s crass
stupidity. “D.H.R.’s” statement that his trusty
steed pulled up one night with his nose a foot
from a six-wire fepce doesn’t prove much. Any
fence like that must have posts, and any horse or
man who couldn’t see a line of posts when so
close as all that must be suffering from beer or
obfuscated vision or something.

to curse about. There is no such thing as sleep-
ing within half-a-mile of the Blowhole after, say,
4 a.m. ; and it has struck me that that fact may
be the reason why the residents turn in so
early. It is a rare thing to see a light in a window
after 9 o’clock at night. If you see one, you can
wager somebody is being born or going to die.

‘ ‘ Quart ” : I nominate Tweed Heads—
Point Danger—Cooloon—Coolangatta, which is
partly in N.S.W. and partly in Queensland, as
the most variously-named township in the Com-
monwealth. It is the terminal station of the
Bananaland South Coast railway, and is called
Tweed Heads by the Railway Department.
(Although to all intents and purposes belonging
to Queensland, the railway station is in N.S.W.
territory.) That is also the name given to it by
the Postal Department. The N.S.W. Education
Department terms the school there Point Danger
Public School, although the school is at the end
of the township farthest away from the rocky
headland that is misnamed a point, anyhow.
To the Police Department the place is the village
of Cooloon, and this also is the title applied to it
by the Lands Department. The portion of it on
the Queensland side—a tick fence separates the
two portions—is known as Coolangatta. Locally
both parts are called The Heads, but it is proba-
bly only a question of time when some stodgy
alderman will propose to call it either Brighton
or Ramsgate. Despite all these drawbacks, it is a
beautiful spot, and, in my opinion, is unrivalled
in Australia as a watering-place.

your own account at all?” “ Didn’t I tell you,
sir, it was to give Hannah a change I went down ?
It’s done her all the good in the world. She
sleeps better, and her eyes are clearer, and she’s
two pound heavier. Three years without a break
was a long run.” “But you ran them yourself.”
“Well, yes, but the monotony tells on Hannah
inore’n on me. Fact, I don’t feel it at all so long’s
Hannah’s right.”
Mr. F. H. Wyse sends this breezy letter
from Morangarell (N.S.W.): —
Dear Bulletin,— Gould you put me in communication
with any bloke (a cove will do) who has lived and made a
living in the Northern Territory, and knows the condi-?
tion of labor, skilled and unskilled, prevailing there
Specifically I want information about mining and minerals
(particularly alluvial gold and tin) engine-driving, saw-
,mlhng’ pnnt,ng ’ etc ‘
if any competent bloke (or cove) will communicate
with Mr. Wyse it will be regarded as a favor.
The craze for the importation of diseases
to kill off other evils seems to he alarmingly rapid
in its spread, Queensland Agricultural Jour-
nal, for March, deals with a new phase of it.
There is alleged to be an insect in the Sandwich
Islands which eats the seeds of lantana, and it is
proposed to import this “ useful” insect to Aus-
tralia to keep the lantana down. The Hawaiian
Entomologist is in correspondence with our
people about it, and he says :
The introducing of these insects into Australia is a
matter requiring the utmost caution, The lantana here
supports most injurious insects, and the utmost care
would have to be taken to rear up pure colonies of the
special kinds of insects that it is desired to import
into Australia without admixture of injurious kinds,
Also, the whole situation must be reconsidered ; for cer-
tain kinds of insects can be imported here with impunity,
which it would be the height of folly to introduce into a
country like Australia, with a totally different flora.
That’s a wise statement, with pertinent reference
to the rabbit disease.

“ Uckle” : “The Moodier” and “Cict”
mention gates as the greatest curse out-back. One
says the curse is the leaving of them open, and the
other curses about the opening of them. There-
fore, I am not jumping their claims in nominating
slip-rails. These are the greatest curse oufc-baek,
out-front, out-sideways, and probably will be
out-above, where they will be of gold, and heavy
to lift, and if you leave them open you will get
into trouble for allowing herds of grazing angels
to escape. Knowing what whales the cockies
are for slip-rails, I recently verv kindly offered a
small boy a lovely drive through the district for a
day, what time I was doing some business. I
reckoned that kid would come in handy at the
slip-rails, and would work his passage. Out of
23 gates we went through, 19 were slip-rails,
and 16 separate lots of them (I use the term
“lots” in the right place) were that variegated
heavy that the boy couldn’t shift them. I
had to struggle with them, whilst the boy drove
through and enjoyed himself in a hateful fashion
The next worse curse to the slip-rails is the holes
in which the slip-rails are supposed to fit. These
holes, as a rule, will only take the end of the rail
when the latter has a certain side up, and the
wrong side always comes up, and when you get
the right side up it falls down, because the hole is
too small, and when it falls down it may fall on
your feet or it may not, and you use language
either way, and the language you use one way
isn’t a bit better than the expressions you use the
other way.
A STORM IN THE NIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I woke in the pallid night,
And heard the shrill, swift mutter of the rain ;
And far across the garden watched the flight
Of lightning flickering on a distant pane.
And faint between the gusts of wind
I heard the river turning on its side,
And, like a hooded snake in anger blind,
Uprear its lashing length against the tide.
And down there swept an organ note,
The moaning of the wild, wind-looted pines ;
And, strangling with the fierce storm at its throat,
Came up the stricken cane-field’s whimpering whines.
And then, as cobwebs drawn away,
With flying, ragged edges swept the rain ;
Harsh rolled the storm upon the hill-tops grey,
Soft sobbed the whisper of the broken cane.
Eerily, and ever and anon,
Swooping from hill to hill, a night hawk cried ;
While pallid down the rifts a moon-ray shone,
And, shuddering to the north, the great storm died.

“ David H. Richards ” : My cup of joy is
overflowing at the language “Cict” (B. 11/4/’O7)
and “Lindy Lou” (B. 2/5/’O7) cast at the Out-
back gate. Some of the articles that are called
gates in the Other Side of the Last Place would
fill a stone idol with wonder. The squatter’s
gate is generally a weird contrivance of wood,
galvanised iron, wire, wire-netting, and green-
hide, and is worn and warped and ragged, till the
opening of it is a vexation of the spirit and the
closing of it an utter impossibility. The cocky’s
gate is mostly a piece of wire, whereon are hung
ancient, tattered chaff-bags or remnants of
Betty’s petticoat, with a few odd bits of wood
dangling from the wire to create a false impres-
sion. The fastenings, as “Lindy Lou” says,
deserve special mention, and may the evil minded
genius who them frizzle a thousand
centuries on the rim of Topliet ! In these latter
days of wisdom, I look backward over a track
strewn with the wrecks of 13 different chances of
matrimony, all caused by delay in tryst-keep r>g,
through inability to open outrages, impude: ;ly
called gates.
“Paul Cupid” sends along the two-
dozenth only remedy for a jibbing horse :
Of all the methods I have seen tried to induce a horse
to move on when he has gone on strike, only one is re-
liable. All that is necessary is to squirt water into the
quadruped’s ear, and he’ll pull a land agent out of Ge-
henna. The only objection to this plan is that you have
to get out of the vehicle to give the animal the injec-
tion, and he starts off with such amazing promptness
that you are invariably left behind having a chat with
yourself, and you are lucky if the wheel hasn’t passed
over your breakfast. I once saw this cure tried on a
Chow’s equine that refused to proceed with his burden
of vegetables. A dozen Chows were jumping around
him, urging him to turn over a new leaf, but the only re-
sult was tha! it.- lay down, and, in doing so, emptied the
Mongol in the cart out on the road. A wise white man
came along, and told one of the Chows to get in and hold
the reins, and to “ look out.” The Chinaman said “ All li,”
and assumed the perpendicular with a rein in each hand
in the middle of his vegetables. The man then filled the
moke’s ear with a jugful of water, and fled. The moke
scrambled to his feet, and, with one ear down and the
other up, darted away as if he were driven by the devil,
amid many “ Hi yahs ! ” and much scattering of Con-
fucians. The heathen in the cart called loudly upon Joss
to deliver him, and then delivered himself by leaping out
like a gigantic frog. He had hardly hit the ground when
there was only a cloud of dust, a streak of vegetables,
and 13 gesticulating and blasphemous Chows to show
that there had ever been a horse and cart in the vicinity.
ON A RUNAWAY.
FIRST MOTOR FIEND : “ Which shall it be—the cow or the sicaggy ?”
SECOND DITTO : “ Swaggy — he's the cheapest."
Farmer Behan, of Garfield, near Jericho
(Q.), is going in for ostrich raising. He recently
imported a pair of oirds from S’Africa, when he
might have got them quite as good and much
more cheaply in Australia, and should they prove
a success he intends launching out. This is
alleged to be the first attempt at the business in
Bananaland. In N.S. Wales, curiously, the prin-
cipal ostrich farm is within three miles'of Sydney,
and while that means artificial feeding, it also
means that the bird holds its tail right up against
the market.
THE FRUGAL MIND .
M‘CARTY: “ Why didn’t you get a sixpenny stamp for that instead of six penny ones, McPherson?”
McPHERSON: “Nay, nay, mon, always get th ’ worth o’ yer siller.”
“ Uckle ” : The cocky is an unfortunate
cove. The last harvest was a record one, and there
was every prospect of a glut in th e produce markets ;
so most farmers sold their hay in the stack, imme-
diately, at from 255. to 30s. per ton. (That is in
our district.) Only 17 points of rain fell here in
March, and very little more in April, and this
has played the mischief with the grasses.
Judging by the weather reports and the present
price of hay in the Sydney markets—£4 to £4 15s.
per ton—other districts have fared just as badly.
In order to save their stock from starving, the
farmers are now buying back their own stacks,
which have never been shifted from their pad-
docks, at an advance of from 15s. to 255. per ton.
Just imagine the heart-breaking game that is !
‘ ‘ Robin X”: The first selection, under John
Robertson’s Land Act of 1861, was taken up by
one Richard Collier, through his agent, Richard-
son, of Bathurst, and now forms part of the town-
ship of Newbridge (N.S.W.), some 20 miles on
the Bourke side of Bathurst. The selection
originally comprised 320 acres. Collier got into
difficulties, and the property passed to Thomas
Lane, who passed it on to the father of the present
owner, Michael Toomey. Toomey built a hotel
upon its frontage. Another portion is used as a
town recreation-ground.
“ Janor ” : May I supplement “David H.
Richards’ ” reply to “Duroc” (B. 25/4/’O7) with
these instances of horse sense? (1) The bullocky’s
hack that could enter any paddock fenced with
posts and two rails (if the feed was good enough)
by rolling himself under the bottom rail. (2) The
prospector’s moke that could always tell by scent
if the water in the centre of a salt lake was fresh
enough to drink. (3) The fossicker’s pack-horse
that, being only used on Saturdays to pack tucker
from the township to the camp, at last became so
sensible that he could never be found at week
ends, though plainly visible from the camp every
other day. Owner found out that the ’oss counted
the days by depositing a small stone daily at the
foot of a selected tree for six days. On the
seventh he rested from his arithmetic in a secure
hiding place, whence he watched his owner land
home per boot heavily laden with tucker, and then
he’d come whinnying down for a bit of salt.

Surveyor-General Reed, of Victoria, has
been overhauling Victorian mountains for the
State’s Year Book, and a revised list has been
produced. It is most likely that every lump of
Victorian earth over 5000 ft. high has now been
measured ; but there are plenty over 4000 ft. that
have not yet had the tape over them. The Bogong
Range, which at Mt. Bogong gets up to 6508 ft.,
is the highest; but J. Carruthers will sleep the
better for knowing that the Ma State’s Kosciusko
beats that by 820 ft. Besides the five that get
beyond 6000 ft., at least 20 get beyond 5000 ft. Of
the five 6000 footers, Bogong county has
four—Bogong, Feathertop (6306), Hotham (6100),
and Cope (6015). The other is Cobboras, in the
Gippsland county of Tambo, 6030 ft. Victorian
lakes have also been measured up. Corangamite,
covering 90 square miles, is the largest; but it is
salt. Yet it is a curious fact that Lake Colac
(10J square miles), which is so close to Coranga-
mite that the two can hardly be separated on a
map. is quite fresh.

“ Hamer” : The Sabbatarian atmosphere
that usually pervaded a small township in which
I happened to be waiting for a train, was
desecrated by a stir of excitement on the out-
skirts, and I strolled to the scene. A couple of
men were holding the head of an indignant horse,
whilst an old fellow fixed a bit of board with some
business-like nails in it on the shafts, just abaft
the animal’s tail. The old man told me, as he
clambered into the cart, that the neddy had a
tendency to sit down, and he was going to “larn
it, and if I waited I would see some excitement.
Then he told the young men to let go. Directly
the horse started he didn’t start but sat down,
and directly he sat down he encountered those
nails and the promised excitement happened. I
followed the cart with the rest of the township,
and we picked up bits of wreckage as we went
along, k inally we picked up the old man. When
he recovered, he seemed to think that he had
scored a great triumph, and he told us that the
TTr rS ? try to sit down in the shafts again.
We hadn t the heart to tell him that there were
j or jk sit down in, and that the
neddy was probably at the next township by then.
STRENUOUS STANZAS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When blue-eyed Dawn with rosy feet comes creeping o’ei
the hills,
And new-born Day is glad as glad can be ;
The wild bees leave their hives
And the brown old world revives
And the spring days laugh in valley and on lea.
The red life-blood is running through our young and
eager veins
As Creation takes his coat off to his toil ;
And Humanity a-flurry,
Flutter, bustle, dash and hurry,
Starts eagerly the headlong race for spoil.
We love to think of all the world upon its worlcv way
And we ponder on the subject long and deep ;
Then with bleary eyes and red,
Lo 1 we turn around in bed,
Draw the blankets up and fall again to sleep.

The {mie Hand
Now about the June number, which is just
hot from the press, clothed in a fine cover design
by Harry Weston,
A novel and interesting yarn is on “Old
Menus,” by J. B. Dailey, with photographic re-
productions of famous dinner cards—those of
Bismarck (in his own writing)—that of the
last meal of the ill-fated French Prince Imperial,
and many others. An interesting menu repro-
duced is that of the dinner which marked the
return for Birmingham of seven Liberals and
Home Rulers, one of whom was Mr. Joseph
Chamberlain, many decades ago. Joseph has
changed a little since.
Art and Letters have a wide representation in
the June Lone Hand. Blamire Young writes
a brilliant article oh Fremipt’s famous
“Gorilla and Woman,” which the Mel-
bourne Gallery has just withdrawn from
exhibition. “ Stargazer,” in “ Author and
Actor-Manager,” gives a view of the chances of
the Australian dramatic author, which is certain
to attract profound attention. It lacks nothing
in candor in telling unpleasant truths. “Aqua
Fortis,” on etching, reproduces all the notable
Australian etchings. Enid Derham writes charm-
ingly on “Lyrics.” Henri Yerne’s “Literary
Life in Paris ” is, on the word of the Australian
translator, “as bright an article as is written in
Paris to-day.”
There are over 100 illustrations in the June
Lone Hand. Hopkins is represented by a fine
series of pictures illustrating: Edward Dyson’s
humorous story, “Two Battlers and a Bear”;
Norman Lindsay has, among other work, a page of
dog pictures of wonderful humor. D. H. Souter,
Lionel Lindsay, George Lambert, B. E. Minns,
Alex. Sass, Harry Weston, Frank Mahony, Percy
Spence, Alice Muskett, F. Rodway, Albert Enes
contribute excellent work. No magazine in the
world has such a wide range of first-rank artists
as The Lone Hand.
Fiction will be particularly strong in the June
Lone Hand. A sensational political intrigue
series, “The Secrets of a Prime Minister,” is
opened. Ethel Turner, Edward Dyson, Albert
Dorrington, “G. B. Lancaster ” and others, have
stories of sentiment, humor and ad venture.
Many thousands were disappointed of obtaining
The Lone Hand in May. The proprietors

The glory of Fasoli’s (Melbourne’s one-time
premier Bohemian resort) is departing. The old
place in Lonsdale-street is now in the hands of
one Guiseppe, whilst Fasoli pulls the beer-pump
and dispenses counter-lunch in King-street. The
dining-room is still a feature of the place, but one
misses many faces from the long table.

Another alleged aboriginal centenarian —
King Tommy, this time—died, at the Aborigines’
Home, near Grafton (N.S.W.), the other Sunday.
For years he camped on Junction Hill, but
when his subjects dwindled down to under a
score, he sought a Government asylum, where he
ended his nominal hundred years in peace.
It was Tom Johnson, an American pal of
Henry George’s, who first put forward the idea
that railways ought to be free, and supported by
a land-tax. Now another Tom Johnson, on arriv-
ing as Chief Commissioner of N.S. Wales railways,
finds a Federal M.P. resurrecting his namesake’s
long-laid ghost.
The name of the new Hinglish expert who
is to manage Auckland (M.L.) tramways is
Walklate, a singularly inappropriate one in the
circumstances, for who walks late unless the tram-
way service has broken down ? For its reputation’s
sake, the co. ought to import a person with a less
disastrous designation—Johnson, for preference.
Mrs. Greenhalgh, of Lismore (N.S.W.),
who, if she is thelo4years that the oldest inhabitant
says she is, is probably the most ancient matron
in the Commonwealth, still earns her daily bread
by caretaking the local town hall. She walks to
and from her daily work without a stick, accom-
panied by her pet monkey, which she has cared
for during the last 27 years.
Dear Bulletin. —Have you observed that
those wretched Victorians forced a N.S.W.
sculptor to take the contract for their statue of
our late beloved Queen, and actually inflicted
their miserable money upon him ? When will
this shocking injustice to the Ma State cease ?
Yours plaintively, O. Jarruthers.
The commencement of the pig-iron indus-
try at Lithgow (N.S.W.) recalls the old name of
Enoch Hughes. It is over forty years since he
produced pig-iron at Mittagong—the first in
N.S.W. He might have spent his life in that
enterprise, but the importing influence was too
powerful, and locally-made pig-iron was cold-
shouldered. And when he started manufactur-
ing bar iron, a couple of small contracts were all
he could secure.
The great downfall—the memorable crash,
and historical slump, and utter obliteration and
blotting out, and the complete funeral—of the
Queensland State elections came to pass in the
case of ex-Senator Drake. That shifty political
Jack-of-all-trades and supporter of all sides lost
his senatorial seat last December, and now he
even loses his deposit,
bane, out of over
James George
At North Bris-
-3600 votes polled,
Drake scored 137.
THE YELLOW MAN’S LONELY OUTPOST.
From The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabi-
tant :
Obit, “at Sydney. Hospital, on May 14, Patrick Lynch,
late of Sheet o’Bark, near Woodstock, aged 69 years.
Buried at Cowra.” Mr. Lynch, who was a brother of the
late Andrew' Lynch, for some years M.L.A. for Carcoar,
was an ideal bush publican. The little Sheet o’ Bark inn
was midway between Oarcoar and Cowra, and was a
stopping place for Cobb’s coach. I was journeying one
sultry day, per Cobb, to Cowra, and the arrival at “The
Sheet ” was hailed with delight. Everybody got dow'n,
carrying his thirst in his mouth, and the price of drink
in his hand—and then, not a drop of liquor was to be had.
Even cold water was scarce. An old resident had been
buried the previous day in the little cemetery, about
half-a-mile away, and,. as Pat Lynch explained, the
mourners had consumed every drop of liquor, hard and
soft, upon the premises. A Cowra auctioneer, named
Stibbard, knew Lynch of old, and declined to believe that
he was maintaining the flush upon his countenance with
tea. A brigand-like raid on the premises revealed half a
bottle of whisky, which Patrick had planted for his own
use. The coach left the Sheet o’ Bark still pretty dry,
but it left Patrick drier.
The world. has lost, at the age of 86,
Thomas Beecham, the man who plastered his pill
advertisements on the Pyramids, the North
Pole, and any other spot he could reach.
Beecham asserted some time ago that he spent
£lOO,OOO per annum on advertising, and the
statement isn’t as hard to believe as some. If
St. Peter doesn’t hasten to see who’s dat a-calling
when Beecham arrives, The Bulletin wouldn’t
like to answer for the unpostered condition of the
Pearly Gates.
_ The refusal of the N.S.W. Full Court to re-
gister Dr. Zillmann as a marrying parson, recalls a
noted case. The Rev. William Francis Xavier
Bailey, who, 30 years ago, was known in Sydney
as Bishop Bailey, of the Free Church of England,
and who held the record for midnight marriages
at his little cottage in Burton-street, got six
months from Chief Justice Alfred Stephen for
marrying a minor. When he came out of Darling-
hurst, he applied for registration, but Registrar-
General Ward refused. Bailey applied in person
to the Full Court, and was complimented by
Stephen arid his co-Judges on his legal ability,
but was still refused registration because he had
congregation. “Bishop” Bailey brought a
shady record out with him from England, and
seems to have had no parsonical value save for
marrying purposes. He doesn’t seem to have
even been much good for burying purposes.
THE INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT
AT WORK.
A Canadian gentleman thus addresses the Intelligent
Department Merlin, Ontario, Canada. Dear Sir,-
With a desire to have a parrot, I write these few lines t<
ask you if 3'ou would send one to me, and I will pay yot
what you ask for it. Having read in the geography thal
there is quite a few in Australia, I thought that yot
could get one for me without any trouble.”— News Item,
The pursuit of W. N. Willis by N.S.W. law
seems to be dogged by bad luck—for the law. It
having been sworn that certain lessees paid tc
Mr. Willis various sums amounting to ovei
£30,000 for his own legitimate use, in return for
certain herculean efforts on his part, in his ordin-
ary capacity as a land agent, it seemed a simple
thing to ask that Mr. Willis should pay the legal
income-tax on his lawful income. But by some
kink the law had to tackle Mrs. Willis, and,
after various vicissitudes, the case reached the
Full Court, which decided that Mrs. Willis was
not liable for the amount, leaving the point as to
whether the sum was really due quite undecided ;
and, in return for this piece of information, the
State was awarded the honor of paying all Mr.
and Mrs. Willis’s costs.
Ex-Chief Railway Commissioner Oliver
(N.S.W.), now on his way to England, will look
up Dr. W. G. Grace, if he can. Oliver was in the
N.S.W. cricket team that played against Grace’s
XI., in 1874. He played no “big” cricket after
that; but Dr. W. G. stuck to it for 30 years
longer.
George Kennedy, esteemed as a weather
man in the Yictorian western district, is an
engine-driver on the Tait railways. Kennedy’s
forecasts always top Barrachi’s in the Ballarat
newspapers, and he is locally reckoned as
much more often right thin the official slush-
prophet. But then Barrachi is an astronomer,
and an able one ; and only takes a reluctant
glance at the weather by way of a side line.
In his heart he despises weather as a foolish,
shifting, senseless unstable thing, and not a
patch on the punctual constellations.
How Ultimo (Sydney) received its
name over one hundred years ago: Surgeon
John Harris, of the 102nd Regiment, was in
frequent trouble with his seniors. He stood
several courts-martial. On one occasion he
was summoned to attend at court martial
“on the 20th ultimo.” As a matter of course,
the surgeon could not attend, and he didn’t
turn up at the first-coming court martial,
although he well knew that he was expected.
When sent for and lectured, he produced
the summons, and blandly asked how he
could attend “on the 20th ultimo”! Then,
by way of rubbing it in. he named his
estate, on the right-hand side of the Parra-
matta-road (now George-street West), “ Ul-
timo.”
The house No. 7, Wynyard-street, Sydney,
now a composite tailoring, optician and sundries
establishment, the scene of a big fire the other
day, is pointed to by old Sydneyites as once the
dwelling and surgery of the notorious Bertrand,
dentist and murderer, who passed 29 consecutive
years in N.S.W. prisons.
Two very old Australian names appear in
the probate advertisements from London—Mary
Jane Frances Deas-Thomson, spinster, late of Syd-
ney ; and Hannah Terry Rouse, of Rouse Hill.
The Rouses date from the first year of last cen-
tury, and the Thomsons from 1829.
“ Yarraden ” writes :
The claim of Knox of the Hat and of the Australian
Parliament to be descended from John Knox, the Re-
former, is on a par with Baden-Powell’s descent from
Captain John Smith, of Virginia. John Knox, like
Luther and other Reformers, was a Roman Catholic
priest till the burst-up in the Church. Knox was then
well on in years. After that the Holy Inquisition kept
him too busy to have any time for marrying. Also,
Knox had a poor opinion of the other sex. To use his
own words, “ Womenkind were redolent of the dung-
hill.” Anyhow he never married, and he did not wear a
hat. I don’t think there was a hat in the country till ‘
well on in the reign of James or the beginning of Charles.
Knox’s head-gear was the bonnet of the time, a circular
piece of cloth with a string run through it near the
edge, which was pulled up to fit the head, leaving a
full wide crown. In short, W. Knox is no more a
descendant of Knox the Reformer than is Peter Felix, or
the Soudan donkey.
All this is very energetic, but (1) it isn’t at all
certain that John Knox was ever a Roman
Catholic priest, though there are suspicions that
he was. Anyhow, he seems to have been a notary
or kind of Gentleman One at Haddington. (2) It
is hard to fix a date.for the religious “burst-up,”
but, taking the slaughter of Cardinal Beaton as the
point, Knox was then only 41. (3) The Inquisition
didn’t keep Knox busy, and there is no evidence
that he ever met that institution. (4) He found
time to marry twice, and to leave two sons and
three daughters. The gay old reformer was 59
when he married his second wife—a girl of 16 or
less, and a peer’s daughter—and he had three
children by her. (5) “Yarraden’s” description
of the old Knox’s “bonnet ” is strikingly sugges-
tive of the present Knox’s hat. Anyhow, “Yar-
raden ”‘|ias made a niess of things.
George Hudson, the youngest of the Hud-
son Brothers, of Sydney, died just eight days
after the eldest, Henry. George was 59 years of
age. He was not, as has been stated, a member
of the early firm of Hudson Brothers, though em-
ployed by it; in fact, he was only in his teens
when the elder brothers started in Regent-street,
Redfern. When the Brothers became a limited
company, George started for himself at Burwood,
and came back to Regent-street when the limited
company went to Clyde.
There was a coincidence about the hard
fight for the Herbert, in Queensland. Speaker
Cowley, the Philpite, is chairman of the Bank of
North Queensland; William Lennon, his Labor
opponent, was one of the first directors of that
bank, 19 years ago. Lennon, who had been a
bank inspector down south, was in those days
Townsville manager for Burns, Philp and Co. —
the concern that became vast after Philp the
Failure left it.
All the Labor men don’t wear bowyangs
now, in S. Australia especially, where it isn’t at
all unfashionable to belong to the Labor party,
since Price has shown that the Labor party
doesn’t wear dynamite in its hair. For 20 Labor
candidates, the S. Australian Laborites have their
pick of a solicitor, an ex-Agent-General (Grainger),
a company manager, three accountants, one
journalist (J. Y. O’Loughlin, Chief Secretary in
Kingston’s last Ministry), numerous clerks, the
manager of the City Baths, an auctioneer, a law
student, a chauffeur (isn’t this the very first
chauffeur who has gone into politics—Willie Kelly
isn’t a chauffeur), and numerous grocers, store-
keepers and farmers. There is at least one ex-
Reverena in the list; but he is reckoned in now
with the accountants.
Died on May 17th, at Marrickville, Sydney,
Julia, widow of Justice G. H. Deffell. Mr. Deffell
was an English lawyer who, late in life, obtained
a position to which he never aspired and a pension
which he never expected. He was called to the En-
glish Bar in 1846, and was appointed Commissioner
of the N.S.W. Court of Claims in 1856, Master
in Equity in 1857 (it was on his case that someone
built the yarn of the servant girl who announced
him hurriedly as “ the Devil and the Master in
Iniquity”), and Commissioner of Insolvency in
1865. In 1888, under the new Bankruptcy Act,
he was appointed Judge, the position carrying
the salary and status of a puisne Judge. In the
following year, Mr. Deffell retired on a pension of
£lB2O a year, and became an absentee in England,
where he died, a few years ago.

George Towns is still a long way off
Edward Trickett as a platform saint, but he is
getting there fast. Smoking, drinking, gambling,
and Sunday training are things that Good George
abhors, and he is getting on so well that he will
abhor a lot more things by-and-bye, for George is
only a little time ex-champion as yet. Trickett
languished long out of the limelight of sport and
in the gloom of his neglected pub before he laid in
a halo and started to shout at revival meetings.
At long intervals civilisation is reminded
of a queer pair of Outcasts of the Isles. Thirty
years ago E. V. Thompson, the American mana-
ger of a plantation in Nai Taba, grew weary for
the Simple Life, or something, so he married a
Manahake woman, and sailed away to the little
Fijian island of Yatu Vafa, which he had pur-
chased some years previously. The pair cultivate
and live upon cocoanuts, bread fruit, yams, &c.,
and their solitude is unbroken sometimes for
years at a stretch. Thompson keeps a record of
the flight of time by marks on a rock; and on
Sunday, March 31st, had completed 30 years’
lonesomeness. The man is now 80 years of age,
and his wife is 60.
THE SYDNEY D.T.’s.
One of Australia’s best-known and most
highly-respected public officials is so fond of his
dinner that his servants often have to carry him
gasping from the table, where he has sat too long
and done himself too well.
Alfred Deakin and Spruce Myth were
“called” to the Bar on the same day in Sep-
tember, 1877. But the call came to Alfred in
Melbourne and to Spruce in London, where he
was born. Spruce, by the way, was christened
Arthur.
When the Duke of Connaught retires
from his bloodless job as boss of the British army,
a new command is to be created for him —that oi
the Mediterranean. Britain hasn’t many soldiers
in the Mediterranean, and the job of bossing
them at a large salary
will just about fit a
“ prince of the blood.”
HANDS UP!
Trustees of a church sued a man yesterday for pew rent.

These little suburban mayors and their
tin-pot “dignity” ! One of Melbourne’s mayor-
things lately arrived at the conclusion that he
wasn’t getting enough deference from the vulgar
herd of councillors. He went away (possibly into
a quiet pub) and thought things out (possibly
over a pint o’ beer). Then he went and inter-
viewed the local rate-collector, and gave him a
bunch of orders. The collector feebly protested,
but being only a poor sort of animal at best, and
afraid to lose his job through mayoral influence,
he submitted to the mayor and actually did as he
was told, at the appointed - me, which was at the
commencement of the next <j -uncil meeting. The
councillors were at the table, but the Mayor had
not yet taken his place. Soon the door was flung
open by a meek, downeast, ashamed, humble,
middle-aged rate-collector, who stated, in tones
of mingled wrath and servility, “Gentlemen, the
Mayor! ”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, May 21, 1907.
My Dear Arinl
Three recent items affecting the status of
women in America are recorded : (1) In Colorado
a woman has sat on a jury with no unusual results,
save thac the presiding Judge and lawyers “for-
got to remember ” to say “Lady and gentlemen
of the jury ” when addressing them. (2) A Bill
has been introduced into the Missouri Legislature,
providing that “ hereafter it shall be unlawful for
any woman, either married or single, to purchase
for herself, or to receive or in any way procure for
her own use or benefit, more than two hats, each
to cost not more than one dollar and 98 cents,
oftener than every 12 months. (3) Over-indul-
gence in ice-cream has been recognised by the
South Dakota courts as a sufficient ground for
divorce.
“ I’m going to hear the Besses o’ th’ Barn to-
night,” a Nice Girl said to me, with her eyes all
aglow. “Do you know, of all things in this
world I believe I like riding best, and good music
next.” “ And what comes third?” I asked. The
Nice Girl became thoughtful. “I’m not sure,”
she said, “ but it’s either dogs or fried onions.”
The Besses o’ th’ Barn Band has its limita-
tions. It’s too brassy to make it a fair thing that
an audience should be expected to sit from eight
to ten in a big hall, on hard seats with uncomfort-
able backs, listening to brass, brass, brass ; bray,
bray, bray. If it brassed in a garden of some
kind, that would be another and pleasanter
matter. The Brassy Besses really constitute a
glorified English village band. Contrast it with
a good military band, and consider the difference.
True, the audience isn’t in compulsory attend-
ance ; it comes, and listens with tired ears, and
watches with eyes that look as if they had scales
on them, while the band plays a fierce twenty-five
minutes-long selection from Wagner. In response
to loud applause the Besses give “Abide with
Me” or “Rock of Ages ”or “ The Lost Chord,”
and eyes brighten, and ears that formerly hung
down listlessly stand up, and the roof is nearly
lifted off the building or structure or caboose.
The audience has been waiting for a good old
marrowbone of melody or a “yim” it knows as
well as its mother’s voice, and for the sake of the
marrow-bone it endures yards of heavy Wagnerian
boiled duff.
Lady Northcote and Shining Tail, and Miss
Rawson, and Miss Edith Vaughan have attended
Brass matinees. Long advance puffing, and the
Band’s uncouth name, have assured it financial
success in this we-all-like-sheep-are-led com-
munity.
The jersey underskirt has appeared in Sydney
—to a limited audience. “Mother sent it out ”
to a young American visitor. The waist and hip
parts fit, just as the garment’s name implies, like
a glove or a jersey. The skirt part is of different
material, and is all stiff, little silk frills; which
reminds me that glossy black (like a shiny black
cat) silk underclothing is exhibited in a swell
George-street draper’s window. Wasn’t it the
great Napoleon’s second _ consort who used to
receive, sitting up in bed, in a black satin night-
gown ? It contrasted so finely with the fairness
of her neck and arms, and the white and rose of
her rather vacant countenance. And when Nap.
wrote to her from some seat of war or other, he
told her he objected to her receiving men guests
under those conditions. No woman could afford
to do so, he wrote, “ till she was 30.”
Thirty was a doddering age for a woman one
hundred years ago. She was safe at thirty, as safe
as eighty is to-day.
Mr. J. 0. Williamson has declined the banquet
proffered him by a cloud of witnesses to his value
in the community. He has so much to do before
the outward bounding of the Mongolia that he
can scarcely wait for the pie at his own private
dinner, let alone spare time for a thirty-two
course banquet with frills of toast and speech.
Same with Mrs. Williamson. She attends Mrs.
Fred Shipman’s au revoir tea, at the Australia, to-
day, but says “No” to eighteen other persons who
had already started preparations for eighteen
separate teas, dinners, lunches, snacks and
presentations. On Monday (last night) she tore
the time out of the week to attend Miss Eva
O’Connor’s farewell concert.
Miss O’Connor has a contralto voice of
good range and quality, which she is tak-
ing to Europe for polish. If it doesn’t bring
her quite full measure of fame and fortune,
the beauty of her denuded shoulders and the
nape of her neck (a lot of nape), might get
her a duke, or some such trifle, in the matrimonial
prize line. Melba is said to be waiting for her
with the advisory word, and after her notes and
her crudely-fine presence have been trained into
highly specialised assets, the Great Soprano will
see to her launching on the jobblesome sea of
professional oratorio. Mrs. Mayoress Hughes,
who has taken an interest in the singer, was pre-
sent at the concert in the Centenary Hall; so
was her chairman of committee, Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, and a big and applausive audience.
Miss O’Connor is a pupil of Mr. Albert Fisher.
When the curtain went up on the tableau
“The Cheat” (Bridge picture by Collier), at St.
James’s Hall last Thursday, the audience broke
out into spontaneous applause and notes of
admiring exclamation. It was the picture ma-
terialised life-size. Miss P. Mort and Miss Leila
Rodd and two men named Wilfrid Jones and
Satge made up the “ hand.” Miss Mort was the
denouncer, in white gown and outraged pride ;
Miss Rodd was in profile and pink, and the
man with the tiny grey moustache, piercing gaze,
and air of blast refinement supplied most of the rest
of the effect. It was fine. Another capital
tableau was “The Foundling.’* An abbess and
two nuns discover an abandoned baby. Mrs.
Neville Dangar, Misses Muriel Dangar and Doro-
thy Dibbs, and a creche baby composed the pic-
ture. The tableaux-concert entertainment was
given in aid of the Sydney Day Nursery, and
realised £lOO.
The Fresh Air League ball will happen—bar
earthquake, invasion, civil commotion, restraint

Sheridan and Irving Keyes; and the hon. trea-
surers are Mesdames A. A. Cohen and F. Curtiss.
On the Mosman boat : Scott Fell’s political
supporter, had put the case for his candidate
trenchantly, in plain English, before the other
men at the smokers’ end of the raft. If they are
not convinced, he feels that it is because they
are in the position of the Italian gentleman’s
enemy—the person of whom Antonio Banana said
briefly : “ ’E ees a cow-cat fool vith a pig head,
an’ ’is ears trail.” Anyhow, he won’t argue any
more, so Dr. Arthur’s supporter goes on :
You don’t do Arthur justice; he is so selfless that he
has neglected his own interests in working for the public
good. Privately he is the helping hand; publicly he is
the stimulating brain and
Scott Full's Supporter : O, yes, I read all about him in
the New Testament.
Arthur’s Supporter : The man’s acts back up his deeds.
He’s slaving for a White Australia and suitable immi-
gration.
Soon Fell’s Supporter : Go on 1 I’ve a sillier brother
than you at home.
Arthur’s Supporter : And it was Arthur’s voice that
roused even the languid interest there is in the necessity
for making us a nation of riflemen.
Scott Fell’s Supporter : That sucker’s clean wore out.
Arthur’s Supporter: If he doesn’t top the poll the
district will go against its own interest and that of the
Commonwealth.
Scott Fell’s Supporter : You should see the long
handle our frying-pan’s got!
Arthur’s Supporter : But I think the sane electors
are in the majority, and will put him at the top. Besides,
the women are for his return.
Scott Fell’s Supporter : O, Molly, come home with
the soap 1
The discussion ended with that, and the steamer
bumped into Circular Quay. But I went right
away and registered myself as a voter. If remarks
about the length of the frying-pan’s tail constitute
a knowledge of politics, I guess I’m as good as any
man—especially one who says he has a silly
brother, and who cries out on a ferry boat for a
girl to come with the soap.
Mr. Raymond Parkinson, a tall, thin Indian
journalist, brother of Mrs. Norman Lindsay and
Mrs. (Dr.) Elkington, is in Sydney picking up
lost health. Of the many interesting things he
has to say, the most interesting to women lis-
teners is that in India you may have a general
servant (man with a turban and thin legs) for 4s.
a week, and he finds his own board and lodging
and grovel. But other Anglo-Indians tell me
that in a married establishment you need to keep
about six of him to equal one domestic Mary Ann,
supposing you can find any Mary Ann.
Longstaff’s painting of “Marjorie” will be
taken into the National Gallery for the year
the little girl and her parents, the J. C. William-
sons, are in foreign spots.
A certain singer now resting in Sydney got a
nervous shock on her tour through an Australasian
State (not Australian). In her bedroom at an
hotel, where she had just put up with her company,
one of the drawers of the wardrobe wouldn’t
“come out.” She left it alone for a day or so,
then set her teeth and tackled it determinedly.
It came with a suddenness which made the singer
sit down hard on the floor ; and it was already
occupied by the body of an infant.
Miss Linda Byron Moore, of Melbourne, who
has been touring M.L. with Mrs. Stephens (a
stepdaugher of Mr. Agar Wynne), got to Sydney
by the Maheno, and went up to the Abbey
Dangar’s sheepfold. They’ll materialise in the
city what time the German opera shrieks at mid-
night through the cardboard streets of Frankfort
or Cologne.
What a bunch of genius there was in that
English Hebrew family, the Davises, of whom
“Owen Hall’’was one! James Davis (“Owen
Hall ”) wrote “ The Geisha,” “ The Gaiety Girl,”
“Florodora,” and about fifteen other successful
pieces. He edited or founded sporting and
theatrical papers, made a reputation as a smart
journalist, practised as a solicitor for a dozen
years, tried to get into Parliament, and died through
endeavoring to crowd too many cigarettes into an
already overcrowded existence, and through burn-
ing the cigar at both ends. One of his sisters was
Mrs. Aria, who edits fashion papers, and used to
write inspired stuff on frocking (her book, “ The
Cult of the Chiffon,” is a piece of inspired
idiocy, but it’s not fair to judge a woman
by her aberrations). Another sister wrote that
deadly sin, “Pigs in Clover,” that had such a
huge run a few years ago. But she proved her
genius in her book on color prints. As an anti-
quarian, her opinion is no negligible quantity in
Europe. All three had a phenomenal capacity
for work of various kinds, and a feverish desire
to do everything, and a deadly aversion to a
stiddy job.
Baroness Stach von Goltzheim, who died re-
cently in Victoria, was the grandmother of little
Frieda Stach, who is ambling and warbling in
“Mother Goose.” The Baroness’s husband was
an aide-de-camp to the Emperor William I. When
he gave up his cannonading career, he came out
to Australia, and later went into the Victorian
Education Department, like Garibaldi, junior, of
long ago.
I came across this in a church paper :
Afternoon tea was distributed under the direction of
Mrs. . No stone was left unturned to make this part
of the function a success.
That’s the drawback of open-air teas. You’ve
got to turn over so many stones to make sure
there are no centipedes about, and, meanwhile,
the grasshopper is threshing about like a dancing
whale in the milk, and the spider is on the bun.
The marriage of Miss Edith Cooper (eldest
daughter of his Gaiters of Armidale) with the
Rev. E. H. Stammer, of Uralla, was an event of
April. The bride was given away by her shoVel-
hatted parent. She was robed in ivory-white silk
and Maltese lace, and was attended by her three
sisters. Archdeacon Lewis welded the two souls
together, and I have it on good authority that the
event was the most notable that has happened in
the cool cathedral city of Armidale.
Now that “The Squatter’s Daughter ” rides to
conquest in Sydney, it may be chronicled that
when Messrs. Duggan and Bert Bailey, who wrote
the piece, offered it to Manager Anderson, they
wanted him to buy it outright for quite a modest
bag of gold. He declined to buy, but reckoned
that he would give the thing a trial in a hopeless
sort of way, and pay the authors a percentage on
the loss. Then the “ Daughter ” boomed like a
Japanese cannon going off, and the writers have
acquired a house apiece out of their share of the
profits. And as the “Daughter” shows every
sign of Squatting successfully in Sydney, the two
authors will probably buy a terrace next. House
agents are already sending them lists of properties.
A nephew of Max Beerbohm, the writer who
shines like a searchlight in the fog of London
journalism, has been in Sydney of late,
opinions about him are mixed. Visitor Beerbohm
is t civil engineer, and is short and blond. (You
can’t interest women about a man unless you tell
them how he parts his hair, or give some details of
his personal appearance. But, to do women justice,
they don’t care a bone stud about a man’s beauty
or absolute lack of it once they recognise that he
is something—that he can do something—that he
isn’t in the ruck.) Visitor Beerbohm has a more or
less permanent job out Corowa way—l don’t think
it’s ringbarking, but I really don’t know the details.
Anyhow I’m almost sure it has nothing to do with
rabbits. The section of Sydney society enter-
taining him says “he pretended not to know
much,” and commented on the meagreness of his
vocabulary. Curiously enough, in a series of
letters entitled “ The Re-discovery of England,”
from the pen of a young Canadian, which have
been appearing in the London Times, the writer
says the average vocabulary of the young English-
man is about 200 words. If a man uses more than
a ten-word sentence, other men look slightly
askance and surprised or amused. Unless a
man be elderly or a Cabinet Minister, inarticu-
lateness must distinguish the bearing of a gentle-
man. Well, thank Pentecost, women counter-
balance the lack of tongue. They have at least 50
words more, and they describe bonnets with them.
Dr. John J. Donovan, K.C., came out of his re-
tirement on Saturday to assist at the wedding of
Mr. Valentine Heaton, jun., of Killarney House,
Rand wick, with Miss Janet Downes, daughter of
the late Mr. and Mrs. F. S. Downes, of St.
Kilda, Melbourne. The ceremony took place at
St. Mary’s Cathedral, and the breakfast was
eaten at Randwick. The Doctor, a Sydney
native, was originally a solicitor, but conceived
the idea that he would shine at the Bar, and was
called in 1873. He had an idea also that he would
excel as an orator, but he took to Equity, where
there are no jurymen, and where the dry old
Judge asks you if you mistake him for a large
public meeting when you begin to prance round
like Demosthenes in aged Greece.
Thus “Rosna,” from Adelaide ;
The clerical lordship and Mrs. Thomas sorted out about
1000 of the State’s most elect and distinguished, and
dragged them to a garden spree at Bishop’s Court last
week. The chief clerical garden is an ancient and
spacious spot, and the guests browsed about among the
vegetation, and discussed the weather, the view, and
various other fearful and exciting topics. The Governor
put in a late and slightly jaded appearance. He is still
in the grass-bachelor state, and has to wrestle with the
Yice-regal job unaided. However, he arrived in time,
towing a member of the British House of Commons and
his lady along. Mrs. Thomas, a fresh-complexioned Eng-
lish dame, in a graceful summery garment, received the
multitude at the edge of the lawn, and consigned it, on
arrival, to the marquee, where tea was raging. It was a
very well-managed spree, and an excellent and not
over-boiled tea, and no one went hungry or was danger-
ously trodden on in the scramble for refreshments. There
were some pretty frocks. Mrs. Chief Justice Way wore
a handsome garment of heliotrope silk, and a smart
purple toque. Mrs. Herbert Rymill was surrounded by
a black costume. Mrs. Koeppen Wendt wore a gorgeous
cream lace frock, and Mrs. Frederick Bevan a striking
spotted green silk, with ornamentation of dreamy
passementerie that was like an emerald vision. But
most of the clothing saw the light of day at the Cup, so
here endeth the second lesson.
The Nurses of the North Adelaide Private Hospital,
which has lately burst forth into new and gorgeous pre-
mises, are about to give a subscription ball in the North
Adelaide Institute to capture funds for the new building.
His genial Excellency has promised to give occasion for a
vice-regal set, and Chief Justice and Mrs. Way will en-
courage him in his proceedings. The stewards consist of
some 20 medicos, all more or less moneyed and exalted,
and the energetic secretary is Nurse Graham. I may
mention that if you ever require your head amputated
you can’t do better than try the North Adelaide Private
Hospital.
Sweet Nell Stewart has been abroad in this land, look-
ino- very young and innocent in a violet-bespattered
head-piece and a lovely fur cape, guaranteed to breed
envy, malice, uncharitableness and damage to the Ten
Commandments. She looks a joyous being these days,
and more youthful than usual.
Mr. Willie Bryceson Trehearne (pet pianist of Adelaide
Conservatorium), who is at present drooping his long,
learned hair over foreign pianos, and who, according to
the dailies, has been robbed, engaged, and other awful
things during his travels, was, at latest, in Vienna. The
learned one was decorating the same pension as Mrs.
Doubleday and little Leila. Maude Puddy, Rita Hope,
and various other musical Australians abound in the
neighborhood, so Mr. Willie Bryceson Trehearne has
struck a congenial atmosphere. ,
One of our melodious young songstresses, Clytie Hine,
goes to Melbourne-town shortly, to gather in the pence
of the musical populace. Another clever maiden from
the Conservatorium, Muriel Mattinson, accompanies her
(in both senses). The brilliant youngsters deserve a full
house, and if they don’t get it, Adelaide will secede from
the Commonwealth, for Melbourne and the Harbor
Town owe this State something for its generosity to the
various products which they have foisted upon it from
time to time. Some of them might have been better
products too.
Adelaide has been madly extravagant over the grand
opera. Rumor has it that over £3OOO was taken the first
day the box plan was opened, and that doesn’t include
the shekels squandered by hordes of poor but honest
musical folk, who filled the gallery every night at 3s. a
head. Many people took hampers and camped on the
gallery steps from 2 o’clock onwards, knitting the family
hose what time they waited to gaze on the slender form
of Lohengrin or Tannhauser. Even his Ex., who is
scarcely a furious theatre-goer, went and had two vice-
regal command nights, and smiled at the show from the
front of the circle.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENNEHI.
The assumption by Thomas Waddell, late
leader of N.S.W. Progressives, of the office of
Chief Secretary in the Carruthers Government
without an appeal to his electorate, explains
why many objected to that change in the
Constitution when the Bill was before Par-
liament. It is certain that many who voted,
for Waddell as leader of the Progressives
would, if given an opportunity, vote against him
for having accepted office as Carruthers’ fugle-
man. It was to prevent sudden conversions being
rewarded with profitable portfolios that the prin-
ciple of sending back to his constituents a member
who accepted an office of profit was imbedded in
British Parliamentary law. As it is, Waddell
will enjoy but a short reign before a general elec-
tion is due, but, in the future, a member who
likes to change his coat for a Ministerial billet on
the opening of a Parliament will be able to defy
his electors for the life of that Parliament.
There is a resurrection of the Douglases
in Queensland. Cook, which, a few years back,
got out of it=i habit of sending “Jack” Hamilton
to represent it, has now returned H. A. C.
Douglas, one of the sons of the ancient boss of
New Guinea and Thursday Island. Young
Douglas, who knows Thursday Island too—he
traded there for years—is a Kidstonite.
“R. B.” writes : Senator Dobson, the
ghastly incompetent of Tasmania, is up North,
and the Port Darwin correspondent of the Age
interviewed him for news of the Territory, with
this result: —
Senator Dobson, when interviewed, stated that the
passage here was smooth and the scenery was picturesque,
but for hundreds of miles there were no signs of settle-
ment. At Thursday Island he found that the Federal
legislation was killing the pearling industry. Some 110
luggers had gone to the Dutch Aru Islands, and only 80
were left.
Dobson is a mixture of three different kinds of
fool. Torres Straits pearling has been knocked
out by greedy pearlers, who depleted the beds
even to the chicken shell. And Federal legisla-
tion doesn’t affect black labor for pearlers. If
there is any restriction, it belongs to the regula-;
tions of the State of Queensland.
NATION BUILDING.
BOYS (in for egrownd): “He doesn't seem to have
any time to encourage us.”
Visiting Anglo-Indian journalist Parkin-
son, of the Calcutta Englishman, to Sydney
Telegraph, on the unrest in India
It had to be acknowledged that the educated Indian
was quite the equal of the European who ruled him.
A dangerous admission, if true. A mischievous
mistake, if untrue. If the Hindu is equal to the
Englishman, what excuse on earth has the English-
man for remaining his over-lord ?
Massey, the farmer who leads Maoriland
Opposition, says that Minister McNab’s new
Land Bill will never be carried while he is in the
House-fthey will have to expel him or carry the
Bill over his defunct remains, so to speak. Well,
many a bigger animal than Massey has stood on
the railway line when the train was coming, and
a smaller engine than MeNab has run over him.
Wagga (N.S.W.) is a casual place with a
turn for taking an optimistic view of things.
T’other day, a rural gentleman was driving in a
sulky, when the vehicle collided with a dead
coolabah; and spilled him out violently, so that
he just recumbed undemonstratively on the planet.
Numbers of vehicles, horsemen, etc., passed that
way, saw him, and decided offhand that he’d been
smelling a cork, and was merely clutching the
star to prevent himself from flying into the
fathomless abysses of Nothing. He continued to
repose modestly till noon of the following day-
some 18 or 20 hours. Then Mr. E. A. Oxley—the
Mitchell shire engineer—occurred, and happening
to be not quite so casual as the rest of Wagga, he
examined the prostrate piece of humanity, found
the real plot of the drama, and took the patient
to the local hospital. Presumably, if that particu-
lar rescuer hadn’t happened, the patient would
have recumbed till Gabriel woke him by blowing
the horn in his ear. In the country, recumbent
things are always assumed to be sleeping it off.
A lawyer writes :
A case which it would be well for the Department of
Justice to look into was one of alleged “detention
heard at Parramatta Police Court on Monday. A
travelling showman was cast into the cells—where,
at the time of my writing, he still was—
under the following circumstances. He was at Padding-
ton, and sought to get one of his vans removed to
Parramatta. His partner, one Edwards, hired at Parra-
matta, an old crock for the day ; but on the showman
receiving the horse at Sydney he found that it wouldn t
pull. He got another horse, and skull-dragged the
crock along behind him as far as Leichhardt. There he
left the animal at a Mrs. Ryan’s. Subsequently she turned
the beast out. The showman subsequently searched
for it, but it had faded silently away. The owner of the
alleged horse, with the aid of a lawyer, proceeded
against the showman for larceny as a bailee. He pleaded
not guilty, the horse having evaporated or blown away,
instead of being stolen, and the case was dismissed with-
out any need for a defence. Then the showman was pro-
ceeded against for “ detention ” of the animal, which it
was well known wasn’t detained, but lost, and which the
defendant had never hired in any case; and an
alleged Bench ordered him to pay £3, and the
heavy costs and expenses of £2 12s. ; and, as
he had not the money, he was put into the celt.
Therefore, it seems that if vou haven’t got the horse you
can’t have stolen it; but the fact that you haven t got
the horse is no reason why you shouldn’t be detaining
it. I can’t say whether the folly or the inhumanity of
the business is the more conspicuous.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, Mat 20, 1907.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Re the society libel action that caused such a
flutter in the Wimmin Leaguers’ snug little
dovecote, legal authorities are considering the
advisability of having a box plan of the Court left
open at Allan’s. Otherwise things will get mixed.
A mild little sympathiser with the plaintiff was
taking her place one morning, when a crusty
Conservative turned and glowered on her. “ That
place is taken. It’s Janet Mrs. Clarke’s. ” The
sympathiser with the “other side,” conscious of
lese majeste, naturally shrank into oblivion. Steps
should surely be taken to prevent any recurrence
of the incident. Also Janet Mrs. Clarke should
have a brass plate screwed on to her sea :, so that
those who are mere dust before her . aay not
unwittingly tip the ashes of their presence nto the
Social Tabernacle, so to speak.
Yet another heavy handsome lady div ces a
tiny little husband person, and once age i she
accuses him of “cruelty.” Violet Elliott and
Harry Shine are the last couple who' have
been legally divided, with “ cruelty ” as a
harndle for the judicial axe. Harry S. is a
miniature man who looks like a school kid, and
Violet of the sonorous voice is a dame who is
built to match the idea of a baritone voice. I
believe that most of the large wives who protest
that they tremble in fear for their lives before
small, inefficient-looking men, are inspired by a
secret rage because they don’t. I can’t speak
of this case, but mostly woman likes to feel that
the masculine circumstance which spoils her life
is capable of whacking her should occasion arise.
And when the large lady finds her little master
content with slangwhanging her, she finds it a
real cruelty.
The Melbourne Press Bond frolic at Hampton
left the historic tea-garden without a stain on its
character. That picturesque jumble of bush
house, pigeons, and weatherboard will never lose
another wine license through the fault of the
wicked journalist. When the young lions of the
writing league selected Hampton as the scene for
their party, it was the old lions, in their editorial
chairs, who sat back and roared. The cubs
worried through, however, and noth.ng happened.
Reporters’ wives didn’t change hats with any
chiefs of staff, and district correspondents were as
decorous as town-hall clocks. Birds in their little
nests were as nothing to the Age, the Argus, and
the Herald in picnic agreement.
You never know your luck. A Society dame
was busy the other day at Spencer-street
seeing a medico off to foreign parts. A surging
crowd attracted her attention, and somebody said
“Diver Hughes.” “I’d just love to see that
man ! ” exclaimed the lady, with a world of wor-
ship in her tones. .“And so you shall, Miss ;so
you shall,” instantly responded a brawny neigh-
bor. “ Hughes is my cousin, and he’d be proud
to meet you.” With that he seized his victim by
the arm, and, making short work of the impeding
crowd, presented her at the carriage door to the
Westralian hero. He, bless you, doesn’t mind
whom he meets; and the hearty grip of his manly
hand is still making an unwary woman keep her
paw in her muff when she thinks anyone of the
hero breed meditates a “shake.”
Miss Florence Dent, the newly-imported
skateress at the Glaciarium, is a poem on the ice
—a slim, slender woman, with masses of pale
golden hair and a spirituelle figure in a black
skating suit. She has a tricky way of rising up
as she skates that makes one think of a cheese
souffle in the puffing stage. Florence has taught
among the “English aristocracy,” if you please,
and claims for pupils the giddy Earl of Yarmouth,
and the Duke of Fife’s brother, and the daughters
of Lady Limerick. The Australian “gairl,”
Miss Dent says, is smart, a good dresser, and up
to the minute; also a born artiste on skates.
The Glassy Harem has the finest width among the
rinks that Florence has seen, in London or any-
where else.
Streeton’s success with his picture show hasn’t
hurt M‘Cubbin any. The opening day of good
old Mac’s exhibition saw the little red tag which
means ‘‘sold” descending like the bloodshed in a
Bear-Monkey battle on some of the brightest and
best of the exhibits. Professor Spencer purchased
wisely and well at the show. Also the Pinschof
family was busy. There is nothing the matter
with the show itself—and if there was, it wouldn’t
be talked about. There’s a charm about the
whimsical little artist M’Cubbin that everybody
recognises. The students purred over him the
night they gave him a nice little bag of sovereigns.
Mac may not enthuse his disciples in the Mar-
shall Hall fashion, but they like him all right.
I blew into a Bohemian haunt one night, last
week, and came upon a bonny gathering. Fred
McCubbin, the Art students’ idol, was the central
figure, and a handful of chosen spirits were saying
good luck with a fine honest Austrylian
accent, and a convivial accompaniment of black
coffee and long beers. There were E. J. Brady,
Doug Hart (the humorist), Wm. Moore (who is
Arts historian in Yarratown), a couple of brush-
men, and Louis Esson. Also, there was a brace
of poets’ wives, who improved things by looking
pretty. There was much talk of all things apper-
taining to Australia and Art, the favorite fata
morgana of the whole little coterie. Literature
had its hour, painting had another. Then they
spoke of the exiled ones who search for fame in
the other hemisphere. Kindly, tender, old
McCubbin was enjoined to become a home
missionary amongst them, and he promised.
Brady thundered euphonious sorrow over the
chimera that deprives us of our strongest and best
brethren, and Esson piped a lay of the kookaburra
who sat on his great gum-tree, which, could the
wandering sheep but hear it, would call them
back to this sun-warmed fold. McCubbin said
that, to touch the heart of any country, one must
be born of its soil. I wonder is it true ?
Sara Anderson on the stage prepares one for
her fascinating personality off it. She is an
American—tall, fair and dignified —with a cos-
mopolitan education, and the brightness of the
.. sunshine of many lands in her smile. On the
last night of the Melbourne season, which was
the third consecutive night of the long, long
“ Walkure,” one expected to find a tired, frayed
Sara sagging wearily in her apartment. But
the prima-donna had her brightest mood
for dressing-room visitors, and looked like a
daughter of the morning, or words to that effect.
Nevertheless the three nights had been a terrific
strain. Mr. Musgrove has solemnly promised
not to ask her to sing two nights in succession
during the rest of the tour, and if Mr. M. is wise
he will keep his promise. The prima-donna’s
sweet, sympathetic voice deserves all the consider-
ation it can get.
She talks of her early Wagnerian studies.
During a visit to Wahnfried, Wagner’s home,
she sang an aria. Mrs. Wagner jumped up,
opened her arms, and cried, “ Here at last have I
found my Elsa and my Elizabeth. (One needs to
hear that spoken in German in order to quite
believe that the old lady really did say it.) In
Wagnerian opera the type is so essential a feature.
Sara Anderson was the type, endowed vvith the
voice and the temperament. From that time her
Wagner parts were studied with the wife of the
composer—studies culminating in the Baireuth
Festival.
She draws a good picture of the trio —Mrs.
Wagner, all fire ; her own anxious self; and old
Kniese at the piano, so overcome at times that he
must stop to kiss her hand, or hug her—this new
Elsa.
Kniese is dead now, and Mrs. Wagner invalided
and bedridden. Miss Anderson was probably the
last to study under that critical director. Kniese
himself was Wagner’s first disciple and staunch
friend at a time when his work was jeered at and
thrown aside. Kniese clung to his master through
all, and lived to see Wagner the accepted musician
of the German school and of the German Courts.
Is Bishop Green a genuine worker in the vine-
yard, and do his gaiters hustle at the wine-press,
or is he “poling” on the Proprietor? He was
among the departing ones on the India last
week. It was only the other month, or year, that
he had a gaudy trip to the Land of Bull-fog, with
farewelling presents and gush and money withal.
It does not look pastor-like to leave the flock so
much, especially with dingoes about, and drought
threatening, and chaff going up.
Irene Dillon, of the sylph-like dance—who smiles
from many poster hoardings clad in a tea-pot, or
juggling with one—has dropped into an engage-
ment with manager Williamson (it will be with
the Edwardes co. mentioned last week, opening
in mid-June). Nimble little Irene lias been
suffering with a nerve attack of some kind —the
result, probably, of figuring in a tea advertise-
ment all this time.
The sweet little idyll of a beauteous Tenor and a
Smart Frocker has been torn, and left with broken
ends flapping sadly in the breeze. A forceful
maiden carried off the gentle one of the voice by
express, in a specially reserved compartment, for
a many hours’ journey. How she must have
wearied him—all those hours in a railway car-
riage ! Unless he had the courage to pull his cap
over his eyes and doze. But the girl who has
captured a tenor for purposes of adoration would
be quite capable of waking him up with a hat
pin. A Melbourne husband, not so long
married, declared that his bride broke the con-
tinuity of a refreshing sleep on a tiresome honey-
moon-journey to offer him “A penny for your
dreams!” With great presence of mind, he
answered, “ Darling, it was ‘ Love’s Young
Dream,’” and tried to dropoff again. But she
wouldn’t let him rest until he had given her a lot
of lovely details, which he invented with a great
struggle.
The Opera Company has left some of its attaches
in Melbourne —waiting to pick them up on their
giddy whirl through to Sydney. Dr. Schutt, who
happens to be fianc4 to Mary Stoller, goes to
Sydney to try to find an opening for medical
practice, so it is on the cards that we keep the
little songstress in Australia.
Little Miss Mohwinkel, niece of the basso, also
waits the Sydney flitting, and with her a cousin
of Miss (Marguerite) Barckow —a Miss De Cappsso
—who is a petite marquise. Her mountainous
luggage, with its coronetted labels, attracts atten-
tion, the heap of bags is so alpine in comparison
with her pretty little self.
The Wagnerian man-star of the opera com-
pany is Mohwinkel. He has a marvellous range
(lower D and F in alt) and sings bass easily,
but his fame and name are baritone. There
are three men in Germany great enough
to claim the name of “Guest” baritone:
Bertram, Mohwinkel and Van Rooy. A Guest
singer will not bind himself to long engagements;
but his fame is such that he will crowd a house,
if his name be advertised for even a one-night
performance during a season of opera. Thus he
will have a settled house in one part of Ger-
many, and in the autumn travel from one city to
another —sing, perhaps, three nights in one week
at Berlin, then two nights at Dresden, and again
perhaps at Munich, and on through other cities.
In addition to his fees he receives half the receipts
from the house. These singers, of course, appear
also at the big “Festivals ” in various cities.
Mohwinkel’s bass parts are a recent creation, and
his powers in this direction were made known by
mere accident. He happened to be at a rehearsal for
Mozart’s “ Magic Flute.” The bass was missing.
As a favor, Mohwinkel “went through ” the part.
His success was so great that even the orchestra
(the callous mechanism of a rehearsing orchestra!)
rose up and applauded. Mohwinkel subsequently
appeared in this part. In the second act, when
Sarasate has a particularly deep note, the audience
simply yelled, “ He’s got it ! He’s got it! ”
when their favorite descended to such unusual
depths.
On Saturday afternoon Marshall Hall had his
orchestral concert. In any case the affair would
have been one of furore and excitement in wel-
come to the big hearty Prof. It was almost too
much to add the intensity of a Carreno to
the programme, with the returned Ballara
to sing. The Town Hall bulged with its
crowd, and the severe eye of the Law made
the regretful managers turn hundreds of implor-
ing concert-comers away. Carreno played so
that even the most unmusical forgot to study her
dream of a gown (some wonderful weaving of
gold and silver and black) until it was too late.
The house doubled itself up in applause. It stood
up and shouted, and waved its best handkerchief,
till that article tore audibly in the air, and it
heaved flowers. By a really . “ special request
Mrs. Carreno played her own “ Xleine Waltze
for an encore —a quaint, sad little waltz, which
she once trilled over for her small daughter
Teresita, to dance to in her baby days, and it is to
be hoped she did not make Teresita a sad little
baby thereby.
“ Tryphena ” from “Gib.” :
At Marseilles I saw a bewitching widow. She was
garbed in stunning black, with her skirts hitched up to
disclose an ankle too saucy to look demure, even in its
sooty hose, and a hip-hip-hurrah sort of model figure.
Her eyes made a sly, fascinating appeal from under the
wickedest and prettiest bit of millinery imaginable. The
head-m st had long chiffon sails afloat down her curvy
back. She walked with splendid dignity for a low-sized
charmer, but out of her countenance a ludicrous and
impish devilry sprang to hit the gazer hard between the
eyes. And sue was one among many widows I noticed in
that city. The widow of Marseilles seems to be the most
attractive item on earth. .
• There’s in Marseilles an early hint of the Paris
passion for clothes. The flower-seller —the vendor of
April violets—walks the street with her figure curving
artfully beneath a shabby cotton blouse, her waist
pinched in, and her dark hair built up into a fantastic
heap, or erected into an impressive pile, or twisted into a
cunning scheme of pompadour puffs. The she-pedlar of
Marseilles has the vanity of a Cold Country marchioness
and the coquetry of a highly-ornate And she s
not going to let temper spoil her beauty. Even if you
refuse to pay four florins for a poor cluster of early pink
roses, Fifi shrugs her shoulders like an amused savant,
and passes on with a fresh grin for the next likely tool.
Even if she doesn’t get her florins she has her fun and the
sport of a canvass among the strangers who stand her
chaff or admire her cunningly-decorated thatch. Fifi is a
cheat and an impudent baggage, but you like her lots
after the coffee-hued minxes of Suez and Aden.
There’s a brace of Highnesses aboard this liner. The
rival to the ducal Connaughts is the Landgraf of Hesse
the blind brother-in-law of the German Emperor. Three
exquisitely-tailored barons or lords of Lager-land are in
attendance, and, when not guiding their Royal Chief
around the decks, are circulating glad Rhine smiles among
the bony listless English Misses, or swaggering before the
massed gossips of the ship. One of the barons strums
with much dexterity and any amount of perspiration.
In the tropics he toiled at his Schubert and Mendelssohn
till the exquisite silk apparel he wore grew outwardly
and visibly drenched. . .
The Cold Country Misses weren’t equal to sitting like
the hardy ’Roolanders bolt upright on the cushioned
seats. They sprawled on the floor at acute and sharp
angles, making about as graceful a picture as a hard-
sprinting wallaby or a cow in a hurry. Occasionally, as
the Baron’s music paused, and the player whirled a silk
hanky gracefully over his head, the pile of English
femininity in the corner rose on its funny-bone, and
viewed the vulgar listening sitters through its refrigerat-
ing lorgnette. But it’s quite an ineffective gaze. The
self-sufficient ’Roolander returns the freeze with a sunny
grin, and there’s no more freeze. Few things stand
against the half-humorous, wholly confident grin of the
gadding Horsetralian.
No Englishwoman travels w’ithout a complete face-
scape equipment and a lorgnette. The one she plans
every morning after her tub —the other she applies when-
ever the energy permits, or the occasion strongly war-
rants. There must be good excuse tor the mere activity
required in elevating the fashionable refrigerating in-
strument. It becomes a joy to own plain rude health, to
take in sea and sky and savory omelette with the plain
and naked eye.
Mrs. Ben Lempriere gads with a marvellous jingle of
gold bells and au equipment of golf-cleeks that are
guaranteed to last out any number of seasons on the links
of Europe. The jolly blonde has arranged a tour, so
that she can touch at every champion course during the
height of its season. At the end of her cleek-play, Mrs.
Lempriere will hie back, and give her fellow-bangers of
the ball at Sandringham a chance to see golf as it’B
played on the dandy links of the British dominions.
There’s a rumor to the effect (among gadding ’Roolanders)
that Mrs. Jack Fisken and her McCaughey olive-sprigs
take a long roost in the Cold Country, her long, pictur-
esque spouse following in due course. Mrs. Fisken has
two growing girls to drive on to the matrimonial goal
sooner or later. If sooner, she may return to her Toorak
eyrie ; if later, hajfplaps will be in accordance.
A marriage is mooted ’twixt the dear little
daughter of a Commercial Bank manager and a
theatrical widower, who has returned to Melbourne
solely for the purpose of wooing her. He is
earnest and 49; she is amiable and 18. People
sneer at such unions, foolishly enough. They
have many advantages. The young wife of an
old husband sees the best characteristics of her
lord, and runs a desirable chance of losing him
for good before she gets time to lose her love for
him, for evil.
Mrs. Circus Fitzgerald approaches. Letters
come fluttering from various parts. She looks
forward anxiously to seeing Australia again, and
is bringing a fine company with her.
Menzies’ began its winter lounge concerts on
Friday, and frilly-frocked femininity set up the
glad shriek of scandal over its tea and toast in the
old haunts, to the murmuring accompaniment of a
stringed orchestra and waving palms. Napoleon
Boffard trilled and quavered a French ditty or
two. Someone with a pond-like name also
warbled, and Topsy Conn —like a spring poem in
lilac—sang warm love songs.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
Our Alfred’s soaring eloquence, logic and
wisdom raised him to a pre-eminent height at
The Imperial Conference. Australians in feeling
proud of him as their representative should not
forget that D.C.L. Whisky soars over all others
as the representative refreshment of the brainy.
Considering that D.C.L. brightens the wisest
intellects, it may be regarded as pouring mental
sunshine upon civilisation.*
Maoriland’s brown man is dying out, but
for a feeble, etiolated person he does not show
any marked aversion to food. A rather large
brown crush is taking place in the Waikato at
present, its ostensible object being to protest in
ten-hour speeches against breaches of faith on the
part of the pakeha, robbery by the white man, and
land grabbing by the white man’s near relative,
the missionary. The real object appears to be to
eat as much tucker as the brevity of life will
allow. The drab mass is camped near Huntly,
and its daily grocery and bakery bill is £96. The
native appetite is assuaged each day by ninety-six
cases of ships’ biscuits, 700 4-lb. loaves, 12 bags of
sugar, and 401 b. of tea. There are heaps of tem-
porary stores on the ground doing tremendous
business. The native orders his potato by the
hundred tons. The survivors of the over-feeding
contest intend appointing representative chiefs as
delegates to trip to London, where they will
approach Edward the Wily, and tell him how the
pakeha broke the treaty of Waitangi in several
places. But at the present moment there is too
much tucker on hand for the Maoris to feel like
making a start.
On the whole, Queensland sugar-growers,
who have been used to the discolored labor that
didn’t have a vote, and didn’t consequently count
for much, have become a tough lot. Recently the
Beenleigh (Q.) district was brought under the
Factories and Shops Act. The sugar-mill boilers
in the district were inspected soon after, and,
almost without exception, were condemned as
dangerous to the livetof the workmen. A deputa-
tion, consisting of eight mill-owners, then waited
on Minister for Works O’Sullivan, and asked to
be allowed to use the decrepit ironmongery
throughout the next season, alleging that . the
bombs were really safe enough. They didn’t, of
course, mention that already one of the bombs had
burst, and partly wrecked, the sugar-mill it be-
longed to. Naturally, the request was refused.

At the Navigation Conference :
Oom Bill : We cannot place Australian seamen on the
same level as 4’id. a day Lascars.
J. Lyle Mackay (from India) : Lascars get 9d. a day.
Here in Australia it would have seemed a trifling
matter to contradict a man about, but in India,
pennies are emphatically pennies.
A remarkably-informed Melbourne em-
ployer—one Thorpe—has just asserted that he is
“not aware that sweating of clerks is prevalent.”
Is he aware that Queen Anne isn’t feeling quite
so well as she did ?
It must hurt the Sydney anti-Australian
press sadly to have to print in the cable columns
the glowing tributes by British papers and
personages to Deakin, as “ the commanding
figure” of the Imperial Conference.
It is shrewdly suspected that Sydney
Telegraph intends to rat on the White Australia
question—the only rag left of its old Radicalism.
It sends one of its leader-writing staff with the
Governor-General, and, if report is correct, he
will come back “ convinced, etc.”
It is only what most people have already
surmised, but still it’s as well to have it in black
and white for future reference. T’other day
“Anti-Commonwealth” was the Herald’s head-
ing to Carruthers’ latest yelp, or buzz, or squeak
or whatever it is Joe emits.
An effective domestic touch was introduced
by J. H. Carruthers, of the Permanent Wail, at
a conversazione tendered him recently by one of
the Wimmin’s Leagues. He turned up without
Mrs. C., explaining artlessly that the lady had
to wait and “put the children to bed.” By these
signs we know the elections are nigh.
N.S.W. State Labor Bureau has tested
the Sydney labor market for the sugar-growers.
Result, 579 men were acquainted with the fact;
that workers were wanted. Of these 312 took no
notice; 118, for various reasons, refused this par-
ticular work ; of the 149 left, 87 were approved of
as suitable, and 62 rejected as unsuitable.
Ex-Premier Philp, of Queensland, struck
the top-note of impertinence in the manifesto
which he issued just before the recent State elec-
tions. He called on the people to vote for the old
ramshackle Philp who had a huge deficit every
year he was in power, because his return meant
“progress, prosperity and happiness to all
classes.” The spectacle of the devil giving three
cheers for Christianity was nothing to that.
Last Monday Sydney Evening- News dis-
covered that even the proposal to build an Aus-
tralian navy is a conspiracy on the part of Vic-
toria against N.S.W., and that the Australian
fleet will be permanently stationed in Hobson’s
Bay, to the glorification of Melbourne, and the
detriment of Sydney. Other grievous discoveries
are hourly expected.
The Owe-Sullivan has made a bold bid for
the leadership of the “Progressive” remnant in
the N.S._W. Parliament, with a programme which
is good in most places, but, of course, unsound
On the financial question. He might have spared
himself the trouble; the Progressive party is a
thing of yesterday. Waddell has killed it exactly
as he killed the Cabinet of which he was Premier.
The N.S.W. railway traveller,
especially the suburbanite, is beginning to have his
doubts about Johnson. Following in the footsteps
of Tait, in Victoria, the blue pencil has been freely
used by the new man to score out trains, ynder
pretext of introducing a winter time-table; and
stations this week find themselves without certain
means of locomotion that they have had for over
20 years.
The Commonwealth Government may now
go ahead with the coining of silver for Australian
use, Prime Minister Deakin having at last climbed
Affably over the obstructions which British official-
dom has always declared to be insuperable. Even
with our present limited internal use of silver,
there is a certain profit of £30,000 a year from the
coining of the £lOO,OOO (face value) of white money
now annually introduced. Moreover, the with-
drawal of British coinage will mean another profit
amounting to a lump sum of at least £400,000
perhaps £600,000.
If attention to detail constitutes genius,
then the Vic. Railway Commissioners are whales
of intellect. Their latest circular is directed at
the firemen and drivers. The fireman is ordered
(1) to ascertain how many shovelsful make lcwt. of
coal; (2) to chalk down the number of shovelsful
used between stations; (3) to fill in a card
denoting the number of shovelsful thus used, and
hand it to the driver at the terminus. Then the
driver is ordered (4) to divide the number of
shovelsful used by the number that go to
lcwt,, and so ascertain the quantity of coal used
on the trip—“thus, if 200 shovelsful have been
used and eight shovelsful make lcwt., then 25cwt.,
have been used.” But why not go a little further,
and add up all the miles run on the Vic. railways
in a year, and all the shovelsful of coal used, and
then find out (5) how much of the two Commis-
sioners goes to each mile and each shovelful, and
(6) how much their joint salaries add to the cost
of each shovelful of miles? Then (7) divide the
result by the size of Tait’s cigar.
The Defence Minister has been noticing
things in regard to the volunteer forces of Aus-
tralia, and an inquiry which he has ordered may
result in a sensible decision to turn them all
into militia. Until universal service is de-
cided upon, the only way to get soldiers is
by paying something for them. The volun-
teers, who are not paid, but who cost the
country half as much as the militia, only
soldier, as a rule, to amuse themselves.
There are a few enthusiasts, but the great
majority of volunteers are not, in any sense,
efficient. And the man who is a soldier for
amusement is apt to be a rather amusing soldier.
A more or less teetotal Govern-
ment is offering for sale two pUblic-houses
in George-street North, Sydney. One is the
Observer Tavern, where for many years Henry
Sheill and other coroners held inquests. It was
opened in the late ’forties by Thomas Smith,
when it had on either side The King’s Head
and The King’s Arms; both are now obliterated.
The other house, The Harbor View Inn, over-
looks Dawes Point Reserve. It dates from the
mid-’fifties, a time when Lower Fort-street was
an aristocratic quarter. The wonder is that a
Government which passed a stringent Liquor Act
should traffic in pubs, and yet the Cold Tea people
have entered no protest.
PRESS RULE—THE SUPPOSED BOSS OF
THE WHOLE CABOOSE.
SYDNEY DAILY PRESS (to Twaddle): “ Now, then,
call your late crew aft.”
HIS STATEMENT.
GARRULOUS MRS. GAME (to the press): “And
as I was sailin', Mrs. Press, if I may make
so hold as to speak so plain of what is plain
enough to them as needn't look through mill-
stones, Mrs. Press, the party by the name of
Deakin, which is at present in Hingland, has
outraged the noble sentiments of which you
and me is so proud by a comic opera manner,
in a way of speakin’; and I do say, Mrs.
Press, mum, that if another party, meanin
me, had 'is rights the noble sentiments would
'ave been said in a manner most respeckful
to the parties, which us 'umblc folks should
look up to respeck."
Many of the Sydney Evening News leaders
are apparently written by Tom Mann nowadays.
When the News gets on Federal subjects, it is
decked out with all the Tom Mann adjectives,
and its shouts about the Federal “yoke,” and
the heel of the oppressor, and the tyrant’s grip,
are just like Thomas when he is obstructing a
Melbourne thoroughfare on Saturday evenings,
before the police move him on.
A letter from “ Cocky ” (condensed) :
“D.K.” (B. 2/5/’O7) asks why farmers should have a
vote by reason of their alleged Toryism. Well, it was the
farmer class which returned Lyne, Groom, and Chanter,
and they are not supposed to be Tories. And it was not
the farmer class which returned Willie Kelly. By way of
another question—Why should the Labor men have a
vote when they are so wobbly in their minds that they
can’t decide whether to support the cause of Australian
industry, or the free importation of the products of cheap
nigger non-union labor ?
A belated joke that smiles
down on one from many a Mel-
bourne Fat’s office wall is the
broadsheet depicting the
precious “Victorian Four ”
Senators -to- be (who
never were), whom
the Akgus once
tried to bounce
Victoria
into ac-
cepting.
From be-
tween
meaningless
mottoes, such
as “For Fiscal
Peace,” “Forln-
dustrial Peace,”
“ For Progress,”
“ For Prosperity,”
John MTntyre beams
in old grandfather
fashion, Edmund Smith
smiles a self - satisfied
smile, F. T. Derham looks
graciously down as if accept-
ing an honor which is only his
due, and Colonel Templeton
peers inquisitively, as if he thought
the unliquidated ghost of a defunct
building society might be just rouna^tne
corner. Below each picture is the signature
which each man meant to affix (but didn t) to
his declaration when sworn in, and a state-
ment of the “policy” of the four, and pro-
mises of what “we” shall do, and support,
and oppose. And the faces that beam from t e
wall never beamed from the Parliamentary benches
after all. And the only remnant of their policy
is the “ progress and prosperity, which have come
without the Four who alone could bring them.
And no one cares a damn what the for gotten bou r
believe in, or oppose, or “shall support. , -f j lr
class-hatreds, their rancor, their deep desire to do
desperate deeds for Fat, are of as little importance
or interest as the likes and dislikes of the, late
John Jones, who formerly earned on the little
greengrocery in the back lane.
Prime Minister Deakin has at last secured
the abolition of the present humiliating naval
subsidy agreement. To most of the Australian
requests the British Government turned a coki
shoulder or a deaf ear, or a glassy eye, but in this
matter the logic of the Australian position was
too absolute. This decision alone is worth the
cost of the trip.
N.S.W.’s cantankerous little Premier has
broken out in a fresh place, and the daily press
mildly describes the episode as an alleged un-
neighborly act. The Australian Government
desired the services of N.S.W. Fisheries Expert
Dannevig to report on fish conservation. It
offered, if N.S.W. would lend him for a short
while, to pay his full salary and expenses, and
further to give him a sum of money for himself.
It made this fairly liberal offer in a perfectly
courteous letter. And Joe Carruthers, like a
small uncouth cub with a lump of mud in his
hand, flatly declined. Carruthers is the Tony
Lumpkin of Australian t politics, without the
rough humor which made Anthony Lumpkin
endurable.
A Sydney suburban member, recently
addressing a meeting, stated, amongst other
things, as a reason why he should have the
woman’s vote, that he had his in-
fluence on behalf of six lady typewriters in
a city office, and secured for them a lava-
tory. On such issues are State politicians
returned.
“J.A.M.”: Yes, “C.M.’s” right. To
Sheol with the Commerce Act, I say ! It’s
simply ruining the Tasmanian fruit-growers.
For years past, every grower has sent out
the pick of his crop under his own brand,
and the windfalls, the small green apples,
and the rubbish branded any way he
thought fit. And now comes this gross
interference - with - the - liberty -of-ther-
subject, which is nothing but a reflec-
tion on the above honest methods. Of
course, as it’s an Act to make them
reasonably honest, and emanates from
the Australian Parliament, the un-
speakable Hobart Mercury fans the
fire at present raging, and the poor
little ignorant cocky orchardist, not
knowing the enhanced value the
Australian brand will put on his
fruit, thinks the Mercury a great
and good paper. To Gehenna with
the Act, I say again.
There must have been tears in the eyes of
the Freetrade Aegus editor when he let this—
“ from our London correspondent go through :
Mr. Du<>-ald Thomson has been rather a lone figure
at the Navigation Conference, and has not been able to
appreciably influence the course of events.
And when Thomson, the Freetrade Tory, started,
it was understood that he was to.be the one re-
deeming feature in the Australian part of the
show, as against Deakin and Lyne, the Protec-
tionists, and Hughes, the Labor member.
Extract from the tale told by Joseph Car-
ruthers, State Premier of N.S.W., to his con-
stituents at Kogarah :—-
These three surpluses make up a very gigantic credit
balance, which has been secured to the people of this
country through the administration of the Government,
associated with the good times we have had.
Now which Government is it to whose administra-
tion Joseph credits his three surpluses—his own
or the Federal one? The additional revenue
which N.S.W. has acquired through the Federal
tariff accounts for every penny of Joe’s surpluses,
and much more. And that Federal tariff is a
Protectionist tariff. And Carruthers is a Foreign-
trader, and belongs to the party which says that
the Federal tariff is a grievous wrong. Yet that
alleged wrong makes his surpluses. And when
the surpluses come, Carruthers takes credit for
them, and says, in a manner of shrieking, “Alone
I did it.’’

“ White or Brown” —
Noble sentiments —sounding cries—
“ Trade quite free ”
“ Rule the sea ”

Hear them prate of the “ silken bonds "
Little wonder a man desponds !
Hear them gushing with fulsome praise,
“ Saving the Empire ” with courtly phrase—
Mark them stifling all debate,
Blind—or fearful to face their Fate !
While the storms of the Future lour
Dark and dread to the Coming Hour.
Brown and Smith,
And their Cobden myth,
Look on the future with purblind eyes ;
Asquith pours
Forth by scores
Old, conventional “ Freetrade ” lies.
What do they want —a warning Sign
High in the heavens to rise and shine ?
What do they ask —a prophet’s call
To give them confidence ? Not at all!
All they want is Bannerman’s drone,
Churchill’s cheeky and tinkling tone ;
Asquith’s platitudes, Haldane’s fads —
They’re “ saving the Empire ” with blotting-pads!
Robinson, Jones,
In solemn tones,
Talk of “the flag that each foeman fears” ;
Boast of “ the Fleet,”
And again repeat
Tales gone grey with the frost of years.
Stay ! Thank Heaven they’ve one resource 1
One Imperial, splendid force—
Something to keep them undismayed—
To raise them up and maintain their trade,
Something to polish Old England’s star,
And thrust her rivals and foes afar —
Butterfat Singh— hooray ! hooray !
Toils for three-fourths of a “ bob ” per day.
He will keep
The mighty deep
As England’s ante-room safe for aye !
He will make
The Germans quake
When he starts to fight on his princely pay.
Smith and Robinson, Jones and Brown,
Are saving the Empire in London Town
Talking their enemies deaf and blind
(After the Bannerman-Asquith kind);
Outside, over the rolling sea,
Sails Butterfat Singh, and he shines with ghee !
Noble fellow, and strong and bold,
Saving our land as did Drake of old.
Hip, Hooray 1
Let’s be gay,
Let’s be jolly, and full of glee 1
We needn’t chafe,
For the Empire’s safe
While Butterfat Singh is upon the sea 1

O. O. CABOT.
EMPIRE DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To-day in the schools they preach and prate,
With a “ loyal ” and lewd pretence,
Of an Empire muddied with alien breeds,
And fouled with a strange offence,
Till the babies think that the Mongol stink
Is the Briton’s frankincense :
That their fathers’ glory is in the mud
Where the half-breed children play ;
That the reeking den of the Afghan men
Is the place where their feet should stray ;
That the filthy nigger who struts the street
Is kin of their own to-day.
These things are lies. And they bite and burn,
Till they bring their due reward
In scorn and hate for the foolish State
Which has clouded the White Mari’s sword,
Till Drake and Nelson no greater seem
Than the spawn of a saffron horde.
I pray for an Empire clean and white
Here and across the sea,
Where the white man’s gun is the only one
Keeping her people free,
And the hitter curse of the black man’s breed
Weighs not on her destiny.
For to me I swear it is written clear
As the white sun’s noonday flame,
That if yellow and black be not thrust back
The glorv will end in shame ;
And our children’s children will spit with scorn
On the piebald Empire’s name.

relief, overcame the spasmodic
actions of the stomach, and
subdued the retching and
straining of his starved and
weakened system, and by
assisting in the digestion and
assimilation of food, restored
him to health. He writes:—
“ About four years ago I
became subject to severe bilious
attacks, and could keep no thing
in the stomach. Immediately
after eating I would be attacked
with violent fits of vomiting,
the straining and retching
being very distressing. This
continued for some months,
and notwithstanding the use of many kinds of
medicine, the spasms in the stomach were always
more or less severe after every meal. My father,
who had proved the efficacy of Dr. Morse s Indian
Root Pills as a blood purifier, advised me to take
a course of these pills. I obtained a bottle from
the local chemist, and took two at first, and one
each night after. This gave me immediate relief,
and in a few days the vomiting ceased altogether.
I was able to digest my food, my appetite re-
turned, and I was gradually restored to health.
I have never had any sickness to speak of since.
My father and myself fully believe in Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills, and recommend them toothers
who are suffering from indigestion, biliousness,
constipation, or any stomach complaints.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The interminable cricket trouble has broken out
in a fresh place, and N.S.W. Association is noiv probably
regretting- that it adopted the conciliatory attitude to
oblige Joey Carruthers, who, of course, is a politician all
the time, and was angling for the votes of both parties.
Joe has got into the habit of smoodge, and he smoodged
strenuously during the rumpus when the Players were so
unceremoniously thrown out of the Association neck and
crop. The majority of the Association was for using the
axe relentlessly, but allowed itself to be persuaded
into using the olive branch instead. The result
is a pretty mess. For the first time in the his-
tory of Anglo-Australian cricket the Marylebone Club
asked for a guarantee as to expenses. At first it wanted
an unlimited warranty, but the Board sensibly fixed the
maximum at £lO,OOO, which the MaryleboneClub accepted.
Almost as soon as it was known that the Board had signed
and delivered its guarantee, the old crowd that had tried
so hard to put the game on a boodle basis came forward with
a -femand that “ the players ” should have two representa-
tives on the Board. One was, it was said, to represent the
new team that would be chosen to meet the Englishmen in
the test matches, the other to represent the last Aus-
tralian Xl.—though why it should have representation,
Heaven and the Players oidy know, especially as there
are only five of its members left in first-class cricket, and
one of these (Darling, of S.A.) is already on the Board,
and was the only member who didn’t attend the
recent meeting to discuss the visit of the English
team. It is now generally understood that unless
the demand is acceded to there will be a strike
among the dissatisfied players, and the success of
the tour will be damaged as much as possible,
thus leaving the Board the chance of a considerable
loss. There is a suspicion that someone on the
Marylebone Club played into the hands of the boodlers by
suggesting the personal guarantee, which, as said before,
is quite a new departure. Herein the presence in Eng-
land of Mr. Philip Sheridan, of Sydney Cricket Ground,
becomes strongly suggestive. The most amazing aspect
of the business is that if the demand is acceded to, the
players will really have three delegates on the Board, a*
Darling, of South Australia, is a player himself.
South Australia has always blindly followed the
lead of the Melbourne Club, and the proposed addi-
tion to the Board would give the men who tried
to get the game placed on a boodle basis complete
control of Australian international cricket. Even if
there were no conspiracy in the matter, it is against all
precedent that players should have a controlling voice.
The whole trouble with Australian cricket has been the
difficulty of getting new: men into the Australian XI.,
and, if this gang can work its point, the international
XI. will become a close preserve, into which new men
may literally have to buy their way. Rather than
submit to the tyranny of this gang, the Board ought
to cancel the compromise previously arrived at, lock Joey
Carruthers out of the Association’s rooms, and biff the
little knot of grumbling players right out of the precinct?
of Australian cricket for ever.
* * * *
The disclosure of the alleged intention of the
players to eitherget representation on the Board of Control,
or land the Board high and dry with its 810,000 guarantee,
is another example of how the astutest man will fall into
words when the smart reporter approaches him. The
understanding, it seems, was that nothing was to be said.
But that smart reporter, Targett, of Sydney Telegraph,
met one of the players, and from some vague remarks he
dropped the repotter began to smell rodents, so he hur-
ried off and caught Noble napping. Noble was led
gently to spread himself, and by the time the reporter
was back at the office he apparently reckoned he had
opened his mouth far too wide. An inspired paragraph
appeared in the following issue of the Sunday Sun, in
which it was stated that the idea of striking had not
been mentioned at any meeting. Also the players had
not held any meetings, and Noble, as usual, was not
speaking for the players, but merely as one of them.
The publication of the interview has proved
awkward for the players. They have not yet applied to
the Board for representation, and, as a matter of fact,
had no intention of applying to the present body. A
new Board will be elected in September, and in the mean-
time, other inter-State players might have been worked
into the combine. The players would have taken a big
part in the impending election, and if they managed to
get a sufficient number of partisans on the Board, that
body would have recommended the Associations to allow
the players to have representatives. That N.S.W. would
have refused point blank goes without saying, and then
the players could have howled about “ sheer spite,” and
gone on strike. It must be remembered that the B ard
of Control has nothing whatever to do with inter-
state cricket; therefore, there is not the slightest
reason why the inter-State players should be re-
presented thereon. Now the cat is out of the bag
the players will be driven to make their application to
the piesent Board, which, it can only be supposed, will
refuse absolutely. If they wait till the new Board is
elected before making their demand, they will be fought
tooth and nail at the election. If the Board of Control
is wise it will notify the players that if, in the event of
representation being refused, they decline to play against
the English XL they will be disqualified for life as far as
international cricket is concerned.

Wonder of Wonders !” said the Sydney
Rugbyite, “ the Glebe, the Mighty Ones, the Premiers,
defeated by the wild hill men from North Sydney. Be-
f >re the men appeared in the field it was hard to find a
m n who believed that North Sydney would ever cross
the Glebe line. But the hillmen had trained for this
match, and someone had evidently taken the back divi-
sion by the ear and licked it into shape. The northern
pack was always good, and the weak spot was the three-
quarter line. But that defect has been overcome, and on
Saturday the team defeated the premier club by eight
tosix. But for the magnificent kicking of Glebe full-
bck Hedley, it would have been about 15 to six. The
strenuous battle between Eastern Suburbs and Newtown
at Sydney Cricket Ground was remarkable for the fact that
the mighty Messenger never kicked a goal during thegame,
and actually missed a couple of very easy shots. Is
Messenger growing careless? He played a remarkably
clever game, and his neat trick of punting just over the
head of the full-back and then making a race for it was a
masterpiece of play and judgment. Newtown seemed to
have the better of the play during the first half, although
the spell ended three all. In the second half Eastern
Suburbs made a ferocious onslaught, and would have won
but for someone kicking off-side and giving Newtown a
penalty goal. The game ended six points all. The
Balmain-Sydnev game was a curious one. Sydney
pack was just perfection, and beat the Balmainers
for the leather easily enough, but the back division
was too awful for words. It seemed to have
forgotten the use of the touchline. On the
other hand the Balmain backs never got going.
Neither side scored, and the game ended in a draw. St.
George and South Sydney game threatened to end the
same way. The South pushed the Saints right over on
to their backs, and walked over them in the scrums ; but
the Saints worked an open sweep that rushed the leather
back into neutral ground every time. It was well into
the second spell when the wearied South suddenly re-
membered that it had a back division, and played to it.
The result was a superb passing- charge, in which four
men took the ball perfectly while travelling at top speed.
The try was successfully converted, and South looked a
sure winner. Out of a wild rush that carried to
within yards of the South’s goal someone kicked hard,
and St. George’s captain marked and kicked a
goal. South attacked furiously, and carried the leather
right to St. George’s line, where the Saintly forwards fell
on the South backs every time, and successfully blocked
all further scoring. The whistle left South victorious by
five to three. Manly was again defeated, this time by
Western Suburbs, the figures being five to three also.
The result is that University, which had the
bye, is top of the list with eight competition points ;
Glebe, South and North Sydney are level with six points
each ; and Newtow-n and the Eastern and Western
Suburbs are all five each. Manly has lost all four
matches played.
* * * *
The League matches (Australian rules) showed
a vast improvement in the g'eneral play. The struggle
put up by North Shore, although two men short, against
Newtown was decidedly good. On the other side, New-
town men played with great combination, and “ the
glorious high marks” that the League player talks about
in his sleep were well done. The result was a foregone
conclusion, Newtown winning bv 96 to 23. The downfall
of the day was supplied by Paddington, which managed
to score only one solitary point to Sydney’s 44. East
Sydney and Balmain played a well-balanced contest, in
which both sides displayed a hideous lack of combination.
The East men were the stronger individually, and won by
48 points to 34. Both teams ought to have been soundly
kicked. Y.M.O.A. again had shocking luck, and was
beaten only by a disputed goal. On the previous Satur-
day the same team had the same trouble, and, although
the umpire decided against the Good Young Men, he sent
the question on to the League for a final decision. On
the last Saturday the disputed g oal was also given against
the Christians, and the pagans from Bed fern won by 48
to 44.
In the competition Sydney and Redfern are
level with six points each. Newtown occupies second
place with four. All the rest, barring Paddington, are
two each. Paddington is a duck.
* * * •
The “Soccer” matches in Sydney on Saturday
afternoon were, with one exception, remarkably close
contests. The exception was the Glebe v. the Navy.
Edward Rex’s men had no hope, and the butchers
ran over them, winning by five to nil. Against Balmain,
Pyrmont showed the better combination, and, in spite of
some remarkably fine rushes by the Balmain crowd, the
other water-side suburb made a sound defence, and won
by two goals to one. The struggle between Petersham
(the baby club) and Rozelle was a fine exhibition of drib-
bling on both sides. A healthy, teething infant was not
in it with those two teams, which dribbled to a great
extent. However, Petersham proved the better dribbler*
and made better use of its opportunities than Rozelle,
and won by the narrow margin of four goals to three.
Ultimo had the bye.
* * *
By running over the Navy, Glebe climbed into
first place in the competition, with six points. Ultimo is
second with five ; Pvrmont and Balmain are dead level
with four points. Petersham and Rozelle have three and
two respectively, and the Navy is still gadding round with
nothing to its credit.
The- fickle crowd that always shouts for the
winner already begins to neglect the erst top notchers of
Vie. League football—Carlton, Fitzroy and Collingwood—
and to follow the rising stars. The undefeated “ Saints ”
were at Geelong, putting the locals through by 82 points
to 46, and in the city five out of six spectators went down
to East Melbourne to barrack for South or Essendon,
They certainly got a willing and exciting game for their
trouble. Almost from the bounce it was goal for goal,
neither team ever getting sufficient advantage to feel sure
of victory. At three-quarters the scores were—Essendon
6 goals 7 behinds to South’s 5 goals 8 belli nds, and a
hard-fought quarter ensued. The red-and-whites forced
the ball steadily along the boundary line and got two shotS
in close succession, but only behinds resulted. Then
another behind came to each side, and both waded in for
the goal that would settle the argument. A South
forward got a mark, far out. It looked like wasting
valuable time, but he took a place kick, with a long run,
while the Essendon barrackers jeered. The ball rose,
flew along a perfect ellipse, and sank just inside the big
post, high up, and the game was won—by 47 points to 44.
Carlton was so sure of victory that only club enthusiasts
went to barrack. The “old blues” never gave ’Roy a
hope, finally notching 77 points to 25. Melbourne v. ’Wood
promised a bett r battle, but again the crowd wasn’t taking
any, though this time it misjudged, for a fast, open
game resulted, and, as with the Essendon-South game,
up to the middle of the last quarter, a goal for either
side meant victory. Then Melbourne, by surer combina-
tion, scored two goals in quick succession, and won. The
omnivorous Essen don (Association), last week, snapped
another of ’Wood’s last year’s stars, and of the six" of
seven men who were the chief links in the chain that
made the famous system, but two now remain. There
are good men in their places, but only practice can make
them as efficient as their predecessors. Meanwhile, an-
other Association team, whose name was Mud last
year —Prahran, to wit—is also acquiring players by money
and billets. The two collided on Saturday, the South-
erners having the assistance of three more lately-cap-
tured League players. With its seven or eight ex-League
stars, Essendon was feeling pretty comfortable, but up
to three-quarter time it had distinctly less voice in the
matter than its opponents, and the barrackers were using
language. Then a strenuous rally resulted in a couple
of goals, and the Northerners went home (per electric
tram) five points to the good—so to 45. But it was a
close shave, and already the names of four of Fitzroy’s
few remaining top-notchers are mentioned as likely to go
and give the club a further boost up. If money is to be
splashed around this way, one need not look far to see the
end of the business—the same end that came to the game
in ’9O.

The great charm about Rugby football is that
it resembles a miniature battle. The same thing applies
to Hurling—which ought really to be called Whirling.
There is no hurling in it, butit is all whirling. One gets
some idea of what that famous charge of the Irish Brigade
at Fontenoy was like when he watches a crowd of battle-
drunk Celts in green guernseys charging with hurleys on
the ball. When writer played the game in the days of
his giddy and verdant youth, a well-seasoned bung was
the piece de resistance —not a publican, of course, but the
stopper of a beer barrel. The ball is a degenerate appli-
ance. A good bung is like the peace of Heaven—
its ways are beyond all human understanding, and, like
the joker in euchre, it makes for unexpectedness
and excitement. One can always be tolerably sure
that a ball will go the way it is biffed. A bung goeth
where it listeth. But this is a diversion. At Federal
Park (Sydney), on Saturday, Glebe and Marrickville
played a ferocious game. Glebe was full of soda
water and enthusiasm, so much so that it tackled the
formidable Marrickville Irishmen three men short —
an awful thing of which only Celts would be cap-
able. From the puck off Marrickville promptly
scored a gaol. With ferocious yells Glebe came
again, but Marrickville, yelling louder, dashed into the
fray, and walking clean over Glebe, scored a point.: By
this time Glebe’s feelings were too deep for yells. Amidst
an awful silence it whacked the battered leather clean
through Marrickville’s ranks, and scored a point.
Marrickville, after a struggle compared to which
Waterloo was child’s play, notched another point.
By this time a lot of the ferocity had worn off, and
both sides settled down to the theory and practice of the
business, and the deft passing was pretty to watch.
Eleven points stood opposite Marrickville, and a soli-
tary one to the credit of Glebe. The second half saw
Glebe make heroic efforts to score, and over and over again
it got the ball down on to the enemy’s line, only to
see it biffed back to centre, to be followed by a wild
charge. No hurling team in Sydney has a chance
against Marrickville with three men short, and when the
players stood bathed in sweat at the close of play the
score was—Marrickville 23 points, Glebe one point.
Other matches were—Annandale versus Red-
fern 1., in which the men from the Syrian suburb de-
feated last year’s champions by 14 to 12. A very close
and well-contested game was City 11. against Redfern 11.
The City team had the previous week played a fine game
against Marrickville, and was expected to eat and digest
Redfern. But Redfern 11. had taken some of the best men
from the No. 1 team, replacing them with second-grade
players, and brought an unusually strong combination
against the City. The result was that City was out-
classed from the start, and only scored one point. It
was great generalship.

In the Adelaide Cup week £28,857 went through
the totalisator —it used to be over £40,000 a few years
back. The Jockey Club takes £2164 of this as com-
mission, and the Government £721 as tax. The club has
given way to the prevailing desire for two dividends
where as many as 10 horses start in a race. Some owners
object, as the price they get on the chance of a horse
winning is reduced by one-fourth ; but the general public
likes to get something back, and. where an outsider runs
second, the dividend on moke No. 2 is often bigger than
that on moke No. 1. Arid even when the favorite is
second—well, in the Goodwood Handicap, True Scot, a
very bad second, returned to his backers a guinea for
each pound they had risked and (under bookmakers’ 1
conditions) lost.
Whenever they mention the totalisator, the
Judders, accepting the whisper of their friend, Christian
Moses, as gospel, say that the sinful thing would increase ;
gambling to an awful extent —that the public appetite
would grow by what it fed upon. Now, S. Australia
has had the tote for years, and this is the record of the
takings at the S. A. J.C. Autumn meeting : —1902, £13,407 ;
1903, £12,457 ; 1904, £8707; 1905, £7878 j. 1906, £9614:
1907, £8705. For a year or two after the machine arrived
therri was an increase ; since then, the “ sin ” has faded
almost every year.
Talk about the long odds of the leviathan
bookmakers! At Takapuna (M.L.) races on Saturday the
winning double, Mille and Duart, backed just before the
races started, paid £797 for one solitary quid! “Oh,
Maoriland, my mother, why was I not there ! ” said
Maoriland poet A. H. Adams when he read it. But he
wouldn’t have backed it had he been there. No poet
ever has such luck.

It seems almost certain that ex-champion Jef-
fries will never fight again, and all the talk of the big
man making s3o,iiuo matches with Squires or anyone else
is just the twaddle of a great has-been. Jeffries, who
now takes a 19 collar, has, as previously mentioned, got
fat inside ; and, if he met with a man who was not afraid
of a great name, he would probably be laid out in short
order. Moreover, the big fellow is now making quite a
large income as a referee. In big-purse fights, he gets
as much as $l2OO for acting as such—and, no matter
who wins, Jeff gets his wad just the same. That sort of
thing appeals to a man who had to battle for his cash.
He gets these referee positions on account of
his past greatness, and age will not stale him or
spoil his keen perception in this matter. Even when
his lower chest hangs down round his knees, he will
still be able, as the ex-undefeated champion of the world,
to get his 1200 dollars. What a fool he would be to spoil
that most excellent qualification for earning money in
this easy manner ! And to be knocked out would ruin
him for that business. He would have lost his prestige.
Therefore, Jeffries will probably go on talking a lot, but
he will not fight.
The fact that the now somewhat discredited
Jack O’Bfien was only beaten on points by raging Tommy
Burns does not say much for the knocking-out capabili-
ties of the new champion. Jeffries did not win bn
points—except the points of his opponent's face.
And his fights were usually painfully brief. This
lack of power to hit a sudden, devastating bash makes
Tommy’s chances against Billiam Squires look very blue
indeed. They are matched to fight 45 rounds, hut unless
Tommy is unusually clever at getting away—which,
according to Amurkan accounts of his former scraps, he
is not—the fight with Squires will not last 20 rounds.
The Australian will, for better or worse, stand in close
and make a sledgehammering contest of it; and if
Thomas can hit harder th ,n Billiam, then what a mar-
vellous hard hitter that young man must be ; and, also,
how the deuce came O’Brien to last 20 rounds, and only
be beaten on points V Tin: Bui.hF.TiN doesn’t often tip—
but* providing thb referee doesn’t disqualify Squires for
hitting Burns on the nose, it will risk 3d. on the proposi-
tion that Burns will be outed before the end of the fifth
round.

Sydney Sunday Sun has a yarn about a secret
dope by which the gentle Bill Squires takes on for a
single night the rage of the vulture and the ferocity of
the tiger. The story goes that William was subject to
stage fright, and his intense shyness prevented him
wading in to smash and destroy. The mother of one of
his Wallsend friends was a Lancashire woman who had
received from a gypsy crone the secret of the powder
taken by the gypsy men when they wanted to do deeds
of derring-do. She mixed some for William the
night he was to meet Tucker, of Wallsend. William
took the dope. Bhang was nothing to it. A friend
saw William enter the ring after the powder had done its
work : “ My Gawd, look at Bill’s face ! ” he gasped, and
dived under the seat. When Tucker gazed upon the
awful ferocity of that dial, he was petrified, and his soul
melted within him, also he went down almost before the
first biff. Squires—so goes the weiyd and hairy tale—
took a large supply of the powder with him to America,
and is liable to knock down New'Torlt City Hall in one
wallop.

A short but merry bout occurred on Saturday
afternoon at the Hippodrome, Broken Hill, between the
formidable Bill Lang' (12.7) and Fin McLean (12.4), hight
“ champion heavyweight of the Barrier.” McLean was
outclassed from the start, though he succeeded in making
himself extremely objectionable to the Victorian cham-
pion during the first couple of rounds. In round four,
cataclysm and disaster, whieh had been brooding for some
time, struck McLean, in the shape of a swing on the point
that would have outed a Northern Territory buffalo.’’
There was talk.of fouling on both sides, but things were
fair enough, and the better man won.

The massed crowd and its intermittent blood-
thirsty howl of joy greeted the Gaiety Athletic Hall’s two
pairs of fighters last Saturday night. Scanlon and Tay-
lor fought with much violence, till the passing of the
latter was accomplished in the eighth round by means of
a sharp jolt in the wind. The Hanson-Wells struggle
went the whole twenty rounds, being ultimately decided
on points in Hanson’s favor. V -

Buckland, of Ohow Africa, ?'. Dunn, of Wes-
tralia, was a, battle of bruisers that drew a big crowd to
Melbourne Pavilion. Buckland was fresh from destroy-
ing Bob Turner, in Sydney, and Dunn had been widely
applauded as the only man who ever put Jacky McGowan
to sleep. When the Westralian came to strip and weigh
in, one realised that if this were not a blushing honor, it
was an honor to blush for, and yet Dunn’s advertisers
have travelled him on it ever since he struck the East.
He is well up towards list., and McGowan gets down
near to the feather limit, and is short for his weight.
Dunn v. Buckland lasted 3J rounds, in which time both
men were punched to weariness, but Dunn was less
weary than the African, and succeeded in lodging the
convincing thump in the middle of round four, after
having Buckland practically settled in round three. It
Was .a battle of bullocks, for neither man knew much
beyond the rudiments of the game. The finishing hit
was wholly superfluous. Buckland was hands down and
helpless, and the referee should have stopped the scrim-
mage before the knock-out blow was delivered. The
preliminary was a repetition of Bull Williams v. Jim
Donald, and Donald scored his second win. Williams is a
plucky lad, and has a good left, but he lacks swiftness,
and his right should be brought into the business, instead
of being something like a sleeping partner in the firm.

ex-champion “ Buttan,” who now runs a Melbourne pub)
have gone to India, and intend securing a large, fat,
butter-eating compatriot of sufficient dimensions to fall
heavily upon the white Australian expert, and blot him
out. The Messrs. Singh have evidently not considered
the slangwidge test, which is capable of fastening a strangle
hold on even the fattest Hindu.

Since sunstroke touched Clarence Weber, some
months ago, burly Gus Rennert, of Balmain, has howled
out numerous challenges to the tall Victorian—in fact,
Gus intends to grab the title if Clarence does not toe the
mark. If so anxious for a struggle on the mat why,
not a Rennert-Buttan Singh contest, whereby the mighty
Gus may qualify? Up to the present, he has defeated
nobody on this side of the world. Meantime Rennert
runs, ’rastles, and hurls iron about, and still remains
some 16st.

Reported from England that the Towns Bros.
(George and Charles) will, after Webb of Wanganui has
been defeated, proceed to Britain and row' all and sundry
who can put up side stakes of £5OO. Also, that Georg*
Towns will row Englishman Barry for the Sportsman s
Cup. There is something crisp and decisive about this
announcement. “After Webb has been defeated” i*
good.

N.S.W. Pioneer Motor Cycle Club crawled
into public notice again on Saturday with the second
heat of the Strelein Cup. The course was a five mile run
over the Bankstown-Burwood road, and J. Jarman, with
I Jmin. start, won in nine minutes. A. J. Powell, who
won the previous heat, was second, and Forrest Finlay,
who lost a lot of time through a puncture, a bad third.
Powell has scored 12 points, Jarman 10, and Finlay eight.
Next and last race will eventuate in a few weeks time,
the date not being yet fixed.

A tentative attempt at an Australian flying
machine was made on the skirts of the Keilor (Vic.)
plains, outside Footscray (Vic.) on Saturday, May 11th,
when David Gordon, draughtsman, of Melbourne, raised
his model airship some 12 inches above ground. The
machine consists of a canvas boat set on a pair of bike
wheels. In the centre is a short metal mast carrying
four canvas wings, edged and braced with bass wood.
Each wing measures 17ft. 6in., and has a superficial area
of 112 square feet. The weapon has not as yet got its
self-contained inotor, and was, for the trial, drawn along
by a 12-h.p. motorcar. It rose a few inches clear of the
ground, when one of the wooden stays of the wings
snapped, and the test had to be postponed until these
were replaced by hollow steel tubes. Gordon says he has
been 20 years working out his idea, and that the “air-
ship,” as it stands, cost £75 only. Fitted with its own
motor, aeroplanes, etc., it will cost some £3OO. It isn’t
an assured success as yet, but neither is it a provtd
failure.

“B.” (from the direction of Kiama, N.S.W.).
There was a pigeon-murderingmarch here t’other Saturday
afternoon. Something like 20 men (“ sports”) came from
Sydney to take part in the slaughter, and about 100 birds
were mutilated to death. One fell wounded into a
garden among some children who were.playing “cubby.”
Then a hairy brute climbed over the fence, and, in the
prese .ee of the shocked .youngsters, wrung poor birdie’s
neck. Why, if these men must murder something, don’t
they go away from amoner decent people and do it ? Or,
better, let them murder one another.

DIVIDENDS
Dividends on stock are paid yearly or half-yearly,
but the Pianola declares dividends of pleasure and profit
every day in the yean
Many of Melbourne’s most important business men have
purchased the Pianola purely on the investment basis. Not
merely as an investment in pleasure, but as an investment that
will give them the necessary relaxation from business cares, just
as they join a golf club.
Business men feel the pressure to-day more than ever before.
The man who is immersed in business cares during the day needs to get
absolutely away from them during the few hours that he can call his
own. The active mind needs a rest outside of__busmess_hours.
The very act of playing the Pianola takes the mind completely
away from the beaten path of thought. The Pianola does not play
itself—you are the one who does the playing, and you are compelled to
give attention to the playing. Therein lies its fascination and its benefit.
Let business men who receive their customary dividend
checks on the first of the year consider whether there is any
more sensible investment than to put the money in a Pianola
or Pianola Piano, through whioh they can secure immunity from
the harassing cares of the day and be the fresher for next day’s
duties.
An illustrated Catalog will be sent free for the asking. When
writing ask for Catalog “N.”

is Patented. It is sold only by

SYDNEY’S LEADING JEWELLER,
SILVERSMITH and OPTICIAN,
A. SAUNDERS,
( 809, 811, 813, 815, 817 George-street,
) opp. New Railway Station, Sydney, N.S. W.


The opinion of the Hig'h Court is, and
always has been, that “ OLD JUDGE* ”
Cigarettes are undoubtedly the best.


Almost immediately after the arrival of
the imported Johnson to tackle what the S.M.
Herald calls the Sydney “ tramway problem,”
the city had two fatal tram accidents in one day.
In previous times, before there was any imported
Johnson, two fatal accidents in a month was a fair
average. There is no idea of suggesting that the
imported Johnson causes accidents, but the im-
ported Johnson as a preventative of accidents
seems rather a failure.
A display of feminine headgear in a Pitt-
street (Sydney) millinery shop window bore a
label—“ Every hat shown, 17s. Gd. each.” Of
the 2000 women who came to examine, and re-
mained to adore the chic, stylish, smart, elegant
contraptions, 1900 saw on the glass window a
notice, neatly typewritten on a piece of gummed
paper, and evidently done by a fire-eating Social-
ist, to this effect: —
We are able to sell these hats at this absurdly low
figure because we pay absurdly losv wag'es. Read the
report of the shop-assistants’ case now before the Arbitra-
tion Court.
This notice attracted a greater crowd than the hat
display, and was responsible for the blocking up
of the footpath before it was frantically torn off
by an indignant fire-eating anti-Sosh employee of
the aforesaid millinery den.
A S.M. Herald reporter nearly burst his
braces to be the first outsider to occupy a position
on the foot-plate of the “first locally-made engine
for use on Australian railways.” As a matter of
fact, locally-made locomotives were commenced
in Sydney in 1869 ; Mort & Co. built them in
1870, and -both Queensland and Victoria made
locos, years and years ago, and are making them
yet. That Herald man was a generation in
arrears of time.
There is an election campaign in Victoria.
Few people know of it, but in point of fact quite
a number of Rich Landlords are going to the
country, and the voice of the candidate occasionally
breaks through the dense fog of indifference.
Some of the candidates are unopposed, and have
no need to hold meetings ; but they like to address
their constituents about once, just to create the
impression that they are a live political force.
Meanwhile pickpockets are doing fairly well.
The Eat Man holds up both hands in favor of the
motion that there is no land famine, and that a
graduated land-tax is an outrage, and while the
Fat Man’s hands are up the Swift Man goes
through his, clothes.

Williams
Shaving
Soap
produces a lather that differs from all others.
First, in body. It is thick and close and profuse.
Second, in lasting qualities. It holds its moisture and remains on the
face, thick and creamy,without the drying and smarting effects of other kinds.
Third, in its action. It softens the beard and soothes the face as no
other lather does.
Fourth, in its after effect. Unlike the lather of other
soaps, it always leaves the face cool, comfortable and
refreshed.
“The only kind that won’t smart or dry on the face.”
Sold by chemists, hairdressers and perfumers all over the
world, or mailed to any address on receipt of price in stamps.

600 SONGS
WORDS and MUS!C
FOR
2/6
IN the World of Music there are many treasures of Song
which for various reasons are denied the average'
music and song- lover. It may be that your local music-
seller does not stock your favorite song, or it has long
since ceased to sell, and so has passed out of print, which
is often the fate of many precious old-time songs or
ballads of happy memories. Perhaps you wish for some
new, but popular, old world or American tune, quite
unknown here, or possibly some local air of your native
itngland, Scotland, Ireland or Wales. These, and many
others, with the national songs of various lands, you may
have tried to procure locally, but how many musicsellers
carry stocks to suit so many varied tastes ? In our “ Gem
Budget of Songs,” containing 600 Songs, Words, and
Melody, for 2s. 6d., we give the largest collection of
songs ever bound together between the covers -of
one book. In it are to be found songs old and
, su *fc every taste—from grave to gay, from
the sublime to the ridiculous—without a coarse or
vulgar line from cover to cover. Therein you will find
the patriotic and national songs of England, Scotland,
Ireland, Wales,'France, Germany, America, &c. ; also
sacred, sentimental, comic, coon, nigger, pathetic, &c.
including such world-famous favorites as “Annie
Laurie,” “Juanita,” “My Heart’s in the'Highlands,”
Robin Adair,” “Killarney.” “Save the Boy,” “In Old
Madrid,” “Men of Harlech,” “ Kathleen Mavourneen,”
ii I. Bible Leads to Glory,” “Bonnie Earl of Murray',”
Mary of Argyle,” “ Dwelling with Angels,” “ I Won’t be
aNun,” “ Highland Mary,” “ Kitty of Coleraine,” “ Praver
During Battle,” and scores of old-time favorites, priceless
on account of tender memories, that cannot be secured
elsewhere. Hundreds of present-day popular melodies,
such as “ Comrades,” “Leonore,” and “That is Love,”
are also to be found within the pages of the “Gem
Budget of Songs.” We will send this wonderful book to
Bulletin readers for 2s. 6d. (posted, 2s. 10d.); if P.N.
cannot be secured, and stamps are sent, add 3d. extra for
exchange. Order at once, and, when writing, mention

The Inky Way.
During- the past few weeks every Australian writer of
note, and many not of note, has been circularised by one
J. Winter of the Advocate office, Melbourne, with the news
that that journal is about to offer £5O in prizes for
original stories. The circular, which was grandiloquently
headed “Australia for Australians ; Australians for Aus-
tralia,” set forth that “ the proprietors of the Advocate,
believingin the patriotic sentiment expressed in ‘Australia
for Australians,’ offer £5O for the best three competitive
prize tales." At the outset this seemed encouraging;
but, when the story writer read on, he found that the
tales in question must contain at least 65,000 words(!), and
were Lobe “ Catholicin tone and Australian in sentiment.”
Then the £5O offered is to be cut up into a first prize of
£35, a second prize of £lO, and a third prize of £5. The
winner of the first prize is to be given the right to repub-
lish his yarn, conditionally on the Advocate being adver-
tised on the title page, but the tales gaining the £lO (for
(15,000 words) and the £5 (for 65,000 words) are to be the
absolute property of the godly newspaper. The judges
are set forth as Dr. N. M. O’Donnell, the Warden of the
Melbourne University Senate (Dr. Mclnerney), and
Mr. J. T. P. O’Meara; and it appears that if the tales
be typewritten the judges will be materially assisted.
Of all recent attempts to gain something more or less
literary for next to nothing, this gold-brick dodge of the
Advocate is the cheekiest. Literary competitions seldom
attract any but the rawest amateurs, for the simple
reason that they are nearly all instituted with the idea
of getting more than proper value for the money, or are
faked up in the interests of some particular competitor ;
and nothing is more certain than that the Advocate com-
petition will be restricted to dead-beat litterateurs, the
outermost fringe of journalists, and unfortunate back-
blocks schoolmarms, who fondly imagine that the winning
of such a prize will magnify them in one act into literary
stars of the first magnitude. The lucky winner of the
competition will receive a trifle more than 10s. a thousand,
should he decide to give his liberal employer the minimum
quantity of copy demanded, which is extremely unlikely.
Should he get the tale typewritten at fair rates, the cost
will absorb about half the amount of the first prize ; it
will much more than swallow the second prize ; and it
will swallow the third one about three times over. The
man who gets no prize at all can pawn his clothes to pay
the typist. The stray freelance who pens a thousand
words about the suburban council meeting or the horse
which ran down the street and narrowly avoided causing
a very serious accident which might have cast a gloom
over the community, is probably paid 66 per cent, more
than the budding novelist who secures the first prize in
the Advocate’s competition. The most surprising thing
about the brazen business is the inclusion of the names
of Dr. O’Donnell, Dr. Mclnerney and Mr. O’Meara as
judges. All three have long been known in Victoria as
fearless opponents of sweating in industrial pursuits, and
it is scarcely likely that they were aw-are of what the
Advocate intended when they accepted the positions.
In all probability they were asked to adjudicate, and
agreed, knowing nothing further of the matter. All the
same, if they wish to retain the reputations they hold,
they would do well to hand in their resignations.
“Dr.” Hackett’s West Australian did a thing most
unusual for it when it heard that Varischetii, the miner,
was buried far underground at Bonnie Vale. It broke
forth into verse thus
Which of us forgets his first misgiving
When the early news was flashed to Perth
Of a human being—buried—living—
Down beneath a thousand feet of earth ?
Who but shuddered at his grim position,
Who among us but must fain confess
To the purchasing of each edition
As it issued from our local Press ?
How intent were we on liberating
Our unfortunate Italian friend ;
How insistent each of us in stating
That he must be rescued in the end,
Knowing what a wise and early start meant,
Judging what a starving miner lacks,
How we talked and praised our Mines Department,
Patting, so to speak, each other’s backs.
It is beautifully accurate verse when measured with a
foot-rule, and might have been written by a wooden
image of Tennyson.

It isn’t every newspaper that receives a baptism of fire.
But the North Coast Daily News, published at Lisinore

“ Thomas Clodd ” : Maoriland knows a good thing when
it sees it. Up-country booksellers can’t read the printing
on the coyer of Tiie Lone Hand. It looks to them like
“ The Lone Hand. An Illustrated Monthly. May, 1907.
Price Is. 3d!” Saw a dozen people impudently fleeced of
beer-nioney on a railway platform during 15 minutes, one
recent morning. Tell Norman Lindsay to make the
figures bigger, or something. Maybe it’s all right to pay
extra freight on a pound and a half of English magazine
ads., but the magazine that is going to yell for Australasia
ought to yell at a bob nett in every spot this side of the
earth.’
* * * «
A good many people would like to know the true in-
wardness of that unique monthly, The Dairy-Farmer
and Agricultural News, published by James J. Wright,
Melbourne. On its 24 pages, two firms of Melbourne
butter-agents have no fewer than 14 separate advts.,
ranging from full pages down to half-columns.; In addi-
tion, these two firms occupy half of the reading matter
with letters, articles', and paragraphs, puffing their
various wares. Two vicious articles denounce all attempts
to prevent the mail steamers securing a monopoly of the
butter freights, a circumstance which might be good for
the public, but would certainly be bad for the butter-
agents. All this, of course, would be no concern of the
general public, but for the fact that the same rag has no less
than 6J pages of Government closer settlement advts.
The advts. include plans and tabular matter, and if
can be taken for granted that they aren’t put in free.
Who, then, is responsible for the scandalous misuse of
public money, which is bolstering up the businesses of
two butter-agents.
A WORD FROM THE BARDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis a bright new day, and I rise to state that here on the
Sydney side
The bards have commenced to fill out of late, and their
binjies are full of pride.
They’re patting their binjies with pride to-day, and I
want you to understand
That a binjied bard is a bard indeed when he sings in the
Southern Land.
For the Southern Land is the poet’s land, and, since
Babylon and Rome,
There was never till now a binjied bard that lived in a
poet’s home;
For the poet’s home was once a hell; and I want you to
understand
That it isn’t exactly a paradise down here in the Southern
Land.
The Beer and the Bailiff were gone last night, and the
temple doorstep clean,
And our heads are clear and our hearts are light with
wine from the Riverine.
With wine from the plains of the Riverine, and I want
you to understand
That Bard and Bailiff too long were kin down here in the
Southern Land.
It is not because of a larger fee, nor yet that the bards
are free,
For the bards I know and the bards I see are married
enough for three —
Are married enough for three or four, and I want you to
understand
They’ve a right to be married enough for five, down here
in the Southern Land.
But I think it’s because a bird went round and twittered
in ears of men
That bards have care and the world seems bare as seen
from the rhyming den ;
And twittered aloud in ears of men, and got folks to
understand
That a poet is something more than a joke down here in
the Southern Lan i.
n.s.w.

Headache, Indigestion and
Constipation.
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.
It will interest sufferers to know
that a valuable medicine, called Froo-
toids, has been discovered, which is
now completely curing each of the
above-named complaints. Frootoids
are elegant in appearance, and plea-
sant to take, and, what is of the ut-
most importance, are thoroughly reli-
able in alfording quick relief. You
do not require to go on taking them
for a prolonged period, as is necessary
with some medicines, which even then
are mostly disappointing; you simply
take a dose of Frootoids when ill and
repeat the dose if necessary, but gene-
rally one dose is quite effective.
j. Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so
far that they not only act as an ape-
rient, but do remove from the blood,
tissues, and internal organs all the
waste poisonous matter that is clog-
ging them and choking the channels
that lead to and from them. The bene-
ficial effects of Frootoids are evident
at once by the disappearance of head-
ache, the head becoming clear, and a
bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly,
and by the food being properly di-
gested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when
Congestion of the Brain or Apoplexy
is present or threatening. They have
been tested, and have been proved to
afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any
good at all. It is of the utmost impor-
tance that this should be borne in
mind, for in such cases to take an or-
dinary aperient is to waste time and
permit of a serious illness becoming
fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
antibilious pills make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill
by antibilious pills that could have
been cured at once by Frootoids.
People should not allow themselves to
be duped into contracting a medicine-
taking habit by being persuaded to
take daily doses w T itli each meal of so-
called indigestion cures that do NOT
cure. Frootoids have been subjected
to extensive tests, and have in every
case proved successful in completely
curing the complaints named.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a
dose of Frootoids, instead of an or-
dinary aperient; by so doing, the pa-
tient will require doses only at longer
intervals, and will so become quite
independent of the necessity of taking
anv aperient medicine.
Frootoids are only now being placed
on the Australian market, consequently
you may at present have a difficulty
in getting them from your local che-
mist or storekeeper; but ask for them,
and if you cannot get them at once,
send stamps or postal note for price,
1/6, to W. G. Hearne, Chemist, Gee-
long, and a bottle of them will be im-
mediately forwarded to you post free.
Chemists, storekeepers, and •' whole-
salers can now obtain wholesale sup-
plies from W. G. Hearne, Chemist,

POWELL’S
BALSAM-ANISEED
The only SAFE AND RELIABLE REMEDY
For COUGHS, COLDS, ASTHMA, BRONCHITIS,
NIGHT COUGH, INFLUENZA, etc.
The unpleasant sensation of tickling in the throat, which deprives so
many of rest during the night by the incessant coughing it causes, is
quickly removed by a dose of Powell’s Balsam of Aniseed. It is a proved
cough remedy of 80 years’ standing. It strengthens' the Voice and cures
Hoarseness.
UNSOLICITED TESTIMONIALS.
The Rev. WM. LUSH writes from Stixwold Vicarage, Horncastle—“ For the past
twelve years I have been in the habit of using myself, giving away, and recommending
your balsam. I should not be exaggerating if I said I had never known it to fail. When-
ever I* have a cough I use it in preference to anything else, and again and again it has
cured me.”
Mr. A. T. WOODHOUSE, Fern Lodge, Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, writes— “Last
year Powell’s Balsam of Aniseed cured for me a very obstinate cough of some months’
duration, which I feared would lapse into a pulmonary affection.”
Mr. LIONEL BROIJGH, the eminent actor, writes—“ I think it an invaluable medicine
for members of my profession, and have always recommended it to my brother and
sister artistes.”
Squatters and farmers, when ordering their stores, should not omit this time-
honoured Cough Remedy.

Mark is on the bottle wrapper, and be not persuaded to take
imitations.

STARTLING DISCOVERY of the CAUSE of
APPENDICITIS I
According to an authoritative report it is stated that Dr. Blanchard
has placed before the world his startling discovery as to the cause of
Appendicitis. It is asserted, moreover, that his opinion is endorsed by
Professor Me t chhikoff, the celebrated scientist of the Pasteur Institute.
These eminent research workers, the report states, have discovered certain
parasites in the appendix of every case which they have examined. It is
further stated that there are three kinds of these parasites or intestinal
worms, the most dangerous of which is known as the trygocephal, and it is
this which causes the acute pain. Appendicitis is neither contagious nor
infectious, but it frequently becomes epidemic in character, more particu-
larly m hot weather. According to Professor Blanchard, the common vege-
tables of everyday use may contain parasites which set up Appendicitis.
Fortunately, however, there is a certain preventive of this dire scourge,
ppendicitis, which, if regularly adopted, will render us immune against its
attacks. This remedy is Kutnow’s Powder, which, when taken before
reakfast in a glass of water, quickly removes all parasites, foreign bodies,
and poisonous matter. It cleanses the entire system and gives renewed
activity to the digestive organs so that any waste matter instead of remain-
ing in the body and forming an irritant poison is regularly removed each day.
DR, H. E, WHITFORD writes:
it tv o- T n i , “Chicago, Illinois, May 2.
m , rS ’~ T find Kutnow’s Powder particularly valuable in children’s
cases, and also those cases of recurrent attacks of appendicitis, accomplishing the
two things necessary—balance of stomach and free evacuation of ailmentary canal.

DR. J. BOND SULLIVAN writes:

Be careful to avoid spurious substitutes, which
are sometimes sold for a few pence less. The
purchaser, through a misdirected, spirit of

direct incentive to fraud. The genuine and
original Kutnow’s Powder is alone strongly re-

“A. 8.” : The suprt aacy of the Jap is
only to be expected by those who have studied the
eternal cycles in which nature moves. Man came
from the monkey, and is destined to return to the
Monkey sooner or later.
Concerning a village that warms The
Bulletin’s heart:—
You strike cheerful spots even in Tasmania, where
they don’t explode when you mention Socialism or faint
when you say that Private Enterprise may be too enter-
prising'. Devonport, though from the outside it doesn’t
look like it, is one of these spots. Years ago a Bill crept
through the Tasmanian Parliament providing that, under
certain circumstances, a municipal council might require
the owners of the benefited property to pay the cost of
constructing streets ; and Devonport puts that provision
into effect to a pretty large extent. The township runs
its own waterworks and electric light, heat and power
undertaking ; in connection with the latter the Town
Board is now supplying an electric laundry-iron of its
own make, the invention of its own engineer ; and in its
annual report it sounds the loud timbrel to the following
effect: —“ This iron is of less cost and greater efficiency
than any other iron on the market; orders are coming in
freely, and are at the moment in excess of the Board’s
capacity to supply.” Also Devonport is the sort of town
that prints remarks like this from its municipal inspector
when dealing with abattoirs and food supply :—“ During
winter months, meat (principally beef) was imported
from Victoria. Considering climatic and other natural
advantages which Tasmania possesses, together with its
comparatively sparse population, it would strike one that
something was amiss when ordinary necessaries of life,
such as beef, vegetables, etc., have to be imported... Is
it not time we awoke to the necessity of letting our slip-
rails down?"

IVTO ONE should be weak. No one should suffer the loss of that vitality which
makes life worth living when there is at hand a natural and certain cure for
weakness and loss of vitality. ... Do not despair because you have
doctored and dosed yourself in vain. You can be restored! You are
simply suffering from an early loss of Nature’s reserve power, which is Electricity,
*
i
ll<H
and this very element which you have lost can be restored, so
that you can yet be as strong and vigorous as ever you were.
You lack nerve force, vim, snap, vigor, magnetism, or to
be plain, you lack Electricity, and the new improved
dr. McLaughlin’s
ELECTRIC BELT
is the only certain means of restoring it. It is the grandest invention
of the age for weak people; the surest and easiest cure for all
Nervous and Chronic Diseases, Varicocele,
Rheumatism, Kidney, Stomach, and Bowel
Troubles, and Loss of Strength in old and
young'. It has cured thousands, and we have testimonials from
every part of Australasia. .<-■ , ■
We are the originators of the Electric Belt system of treatment in
this country, and have many imitators but no equals. Dr. McLaughlin's
Electric Belt is the standard, and has stood the test of time. With its
special attachments for men and women it is
the most perfect Electric Appliance for home treatment in the World,
and its price is as low as £1 in many cases.

Fiji.
i IiOM a recent visitor to Fiji:—
Fiji now contains over 80,000 Asiatics, less than 60,000
natives, and only about 3000 Europeans. The Asiatics, in-
stead of being- deported after their term of labor is over,
are allowed to remain in the country, to take up land, to
open stores, and to compete with the white man in every
sphere of life, so that the latter has no openings left in
the country. At the company’s mills, nearly all the em-
ployees are coolies. Only the business managers, head
engineers and chief mechanics are whites; and the com-
pany has white men teaching the Hindus engineering
and mechanical work, with the view of replacing white
labor m those avenues.
• P 1 ® influx of Asiatics lias injured the natives by the
introduction of alien vices and diseases. Most of the
rpi u women are owned or kept by five or six men.
~ Fhe Hindus, both men and women, are very avaricious ;
they think of nothing, talk of nothing but “paisa”
(.money). Commonly they wear necklaces of sovereigns
round their necks.
Although the majority of South Sea Islanders have
a deep contempt for Asiatics, and associate but little with
there are always some black sheep who do not
a ) ‘j e hy the general good moral code of the remainder,
and who accordingly serve as a medium for spreading
vice and disease among the others. Opium smoking is
aoing- much harm in Fiji. European habits and clothes
.p® a “° done their part to exterminate the Fijian race,
the Government of Fiji is in reality the O.S.R. Com-
pany, and is a blot on British administration. The
administration is remarkably weak in coping with wrongs
and vices, and remarkably strong in safeguarding the in-
teiestaof the sugar monopolists. Coolies are very roughly
treated on the plantations, and work for less than Is.
a clay» feeding 1 themselves. The overseers (usually them-
selves coolies) thrash and kick them so unscrupulously
mat often they commit crimes to get to gaol for a rest
and holiday. In prison they are well fed and clad ; they
nave regular meals, and each prisoner gets his lava-lava
(.loin cloth) and singlet ornamented with the broad arrow—
quite a mark of distinction to the Hindu mind. So fond
are the convicts of prison that they have been known to
lun all the way back in the evening, so as not to be shut
out tor the night, and lose supper.
The best cures for the curses in Fiji would be-

A more sweeping and efficient remedy would be to
encourage the natives to massacre all the Asiatic popula-
tion before any other reforms are proceeded with. The
rijian hates the Chow and the Hindoo, and would not
need much encouragement to exterminate them. Failing
tnat, the wholesale deportation of Bam Bhux and Bam
-liass might be resorted to, but it would be much more
expensive than burial.
Toryism and Old Age Pensions.
Britain still picks up occasional ideas from this
side. It is ten years or so since the democratic
vote in Maoriland and Australia demanded old
age pensions. At that time the idea was ridi-
culed by English political critics who regarded it as
another phase of “colonial” madness. The Tory
Australian press was more violent, and assailed
the -Labor party with many loud and eloquent
epithets, some of which suggested that the door
ot a lunatic asylum had blown open, and the
vocabulary was pouring out. Now British back-
wardness has got a move on it, and a British
Treasurer announces that old age pensions are a
necessity, and puts the item on the Government
programme. And Australian Toryism is almost
reconciled to old age pensions these days. It no
ionger uses language which suggests that the door
or oheol has blown open, and it quotes its approval
ot the pension system as evidence that it isn’t
Tory, and never was. There are certain recog-
nised stages in the progress of the Tory, who is a
sort of recurring decimal in this fashion :
(a) He denounces pr< .posed Reform No. 1, and says it
will destroy the country.
(b) He has a spell of silence when Reform No. 1 arrives
and the country isn’t destroyed,
(c) He approves of Reform No. 1 when it shows itself
so beneficial that he would be a shrieking-jest if he did
otherwise, and he quotes his approval as a proof that the
person who calls him a Tory is a slanderer. At the same
time he says that Reform No. 2 will send the country to
Sheol.
(d) This is clause b over again with regard to Reform
No. 2.
(e) This is clause c overagain with regard to Reform No.
2, and it leaves the Tory again defending his character,
yet declaring that the country wh! go to the devil if
Reform No. fi happens.
And so the Tory battles on till he uses up the
alphabet and has to begin afresh. He has opposed
everything in turn, from the abolition of the im-
portation of convicts down to old age pensions,
and has declared everything in turn as leading
to the positive and assured ruin of the country.
The fact that he has been proved a fool
and a liar every time in the past doesn’t prevent
him now opposing the Federal graduated land-
tax, the adoption of the Canadian banking system,
the establishment of a decent Federal capital, and
every other new proposal in the category of pro-
gress as the positive and assured ruin of the
country. He is always the same old Tory, and
the positive and assured ruin of the country is
always just round the corner.
The Writing on the Wall.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hard by each Australian village, where the usual
creek runs down,
Bearing on its muddy bosom all the garbage of
the town,
With a tannery adjacent and a slaughter-house
close by—
There One Lung, the cabbage expert, bei it on
strict economy,
With some kerosene tins rusty,
Strips of bagging worn and musty,
Puts him up his domicile and dwells, a heathen
mild and shy.
There, in soil enriched with fragrance of the cow
tuberculous,
Grows the unassuming leek and the retired
asparagus.
Forcing them with doubtful water, which, on
population bent,
Is a lesson to Australia upon Closer Settlement ;
And a thousand smells assorted,
By the roving breezes courted,
Smite at dawn and dusk the senses of the' passing
resident.
Now, the Powers That Be in Sydney, ’midst a
score of such-like rules,
Have decreed that Agriculture must be taught in
Public Schools.
And a corner of the playground has been set aside
and fenced ;
Ihere the latest information rc the science is
dispensed,
By a farming-man from Enmore
Or the wheat-belt round by Stanmore,
To the youngsters scientifically sifted and
condensed.
Northward, far beyond Port Darwin, looms a
sign across the skies,
But—“ Our Natural Resources ! ” —and they never
lift their eyes;
Out across the Straits of Torres, hark I —the swell-
ing Banzai ” nears,
But—“ The Bounteous Gifts of Nature —and it
strikes unheeding ears.
And a stolid cabbage-grower
Bends his head a little lower
As he passes, and his countenance a smile of
cunning wears.
Cringing lowly at the doorways, see him take his
paltry toll,
Whilst he hates with all the hatred of his puny,
yellow soul;
Smiling blandly, “All li, missee, me have gleen
pea, welly plime,”
As he hoards each petty insult and remembers for
all time.
And the school-kids often wonder —
,f Is it after all a blunder?
Will we ever need the knowledge trained of
nitrogen and lime?”
Back amongst the shades and stenches of his
opium-reeking home,
One Lung wonders how much longer ere the
hosts of Asia come,
Chuckling softly at the Writing on the Wall, tl <
while he dreams
Of a Mongol-owned Australia, that from out the
future gleams,
Where a white man trudging down
From a garden out of town,
With I iis baskets, just a common every-day occur-
rence seems.

The Happy Circumstances of Quong Loon.
Frank Morton writes from Wellington (M.L.): —
I had not been in Welling ton quite three weeks when
the chance of an evening- ramble introduced me to Quong
Loon. It is my foolish habit to wander in discredited
quarters in search of copy. A futile habit, because
copy got off the beaten tracks is not required by repu-
table newspapers in this State, and at current rates is not
worth while even when it is accepted. Anyhow, in a
fetid little den, tucked furtively away in a squalid
thoroughfare off Ouba-street, I came upon Quong Loon.
He told me he was a “ laun’lyman,” but'he certainly
didn’t look it. He sat in a reek of opium, and because
the fumes had got into his head—or, it may be, merely
because I am handsome and dignified of my own person
—he took me for Lionel Terry. My modest disclaimer
he thrust aside as irrelevant
“ Wha’ for ? ” said Quong Loon. “ Wha’ for you killem ?
No goo’! ”
“John,” said I. “ Your laundry ? You work there ?
You like it?”
“No like'v. Makey wo’k, makey poun’. No likey.
Wha’for you killem ? No goo’.”
“ But you make too many pounds. Savvy ? You charge
too much. You too dear.”
“ Too dear. All li*. No makey wo’k, no makey pou i’.
Wha’ for?”
Quong Loon screwed up his little eyes and looked cun-
ningly at me. His pipe gurgled derision. Further
attempts to discuss the financial aspect proved futile.
“John,” I said, “which you like best—wash men’s
clothes, wash women’s clothes? ”
“ Washey men clo’. Oh, velly goo’. Washey women
clo. No goo’. Washey shu’t, washey collal—goo’,
makey poun’. Lady, she blingey sku’t, blingey dless.
Piecey lace, piecey flill—muchy tlubble. Oh, no goo’.
She come, she say ‘ How muchy ? ’ ‘ Eight shilly sikky
pen’.’ Lilly stlain on sku’t. She say, ‘ You bu’n ’em. I
givvy two sh’lly.’ Oh, no goo’ ! Man he come, he say,
■“How muchy?’ ‘ Twel’ piecey coll’l, one shillv fo’pen’.
Eight shu’t, sikky pen’, makem fi’shilly fo’pen’. Alla
g-eth’ eight shilly sikky pen’.’ He say ‘ Ham.’ He pay.
Oh, velly goo’, velly ni’. Bu’nein shu’t, spoilem, he
dammy diaper. Oh, velly goo’! Losem clo’, he say dam
some mo’. Alla same, he pay. Oh, velly ni’! ”
“ You Christian, Joiin ? ”
‘‘Biroeby. No goo’. Chlistian me no likem. Lady all
Ohlistian. No say dam, no pay, makey bother. Oh, no
goo’! Amr—you savvy Al.my ?”
I savvied Almy.
“ Al.my no goo’. Washem clo’ self. Wha’for? Makem
noise, makem wayang. Alla time bloke. No sav dam.
No pay. Me no likem Chlistian. Lady all Chlistian. No
goo’. At my velly no go’! Wha’ for you vvanty killem?
Killy Almy. Oh, velly goo’! ”
“ You go back China, John?”
Quong Loon screwed up his eyes again. Once I thought
he came very near a wink.
“ Wha’ for ? China, no makey wash, no makey poun’.
This countly all li’. Lilly wo’k, muchy poun’.’’
“ But,” said I, “ what about the Factory Act?”
“ No savvy,” said Quong Loon.
“ You know. Make you work eight hours a day, pay
good wages, shut on Sundays. You no savvy ? ”
Quong Loon smiled at me, and I could see that he was
pitying my ignorance.
“Oh, velly goo’. Englis’ laun’ly, him shut. Got
stickem up lules. Chinee, no. Wha’for? Wo’key twel’
hour, fo’teen, sikkytin, alia time. No payee wagee.
Wha’ for ? Oh, velly goo’! ”
And so I begin to realise that there was a grain of
sense at the back of poor Lionel Terry’s mania. Up
here in Wellington, more than anywhere else in Austral-
asia, the Chinese seem to stand in some matters
beyond and outside the law. They have practi-
cally monopolised the laundry business and the
fruit and vegetable business, and they run these
businesses on their own lines. Tobacconists must close
at eight o’clock, but in the Chinese shops cigarettes can
be bought till ten or later. Grocers close earlier still, but
up till ten tinned meats and fish, arid other such grocers’
sundries, can be bought in the Chinese shops. This Wel-
lington is the stronghold of rings and boycotts, and the
most damaging of all the rings and boycotts are managed
by the Chinese. The sale and consumption of opium are
practically illegal; but opium is sold and consumed in
Wellington every day. The detectives, ready enough to
strain and abuse the law for purposes of private spite or
int ( rest, seem to be either venal or blind where some
abuses are concerned. The newspapers are ready enough
to go to New York or Chicago for their scare-heads, but
they might more reasonably get them nearer home. And
some methou if equalising the conditions of competition
as between Maorilanders and Chinese should certainly be
dev -oed. This is not Asia—yet.
♦
After all the tremendous language that people
like Bruce Smith hove at Australia, apropos of
the laws to restrict nigger immigration, about the
indubitable right of every British subject to
travel wherever he pleases within the bounds of
the free, gorgeous and enlightened British
Empire, a recent item of intelligence from Jamaica
is interesting. It seems that the free British
nigger of Jamaica is practically a prisoner for life
on his own island. He can’t leave it without
paying about £5 for permission to go away, even
if he is only going to some other British posses-
sion ; and as the miserable perspiring black wretch
only earns a few coppers per day, that permission is
about as unobtainable as the British crown. And,
by the way, there is another outrage on the free-
dom of our colored fellow-subject which should
arouse Bruce Smith to protest. In India itself
there is a patch of soil on which no native of the
land is allowed to set the sole of his foot. It is at
Cawnpore, and surrounds a monument to the
white people butchered by Smith’s friends in the
Mutiny days. For half-a-century Britain has
rubbed it into the native that he is a de-
graded murderer and an inferior being, by
ordering him to keep off that bit of grass.
These things should be looked into, and Smith,
who has “ a soft spot in his heart for the colored
races,” should pack up his bag and go off, at once
to protest. This country would never notice his
absence.

HEARNES
BRONCHITIS
CURE
The Famous Remedy for
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, <fc CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathino- Hoarseness, Bain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where “Coughs" have been properly treated with this medicine. JNO nouse
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
Beware of Imitations S The great success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it

WHAT IS CATARRH?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining
membrane of the nose and adjoining
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.

Here is a square puzzle, and everyone who solves it will receive the Solid Silver
Watch or other prizes without any other conditions whatever. The diagram shows nine
squares, with the figure 5 occupying the centre square. The puzzle is to place a number
on each of the eight empty squares, so that they shall add up to 15 in a straight line
in as many ways as possible ; no two squares may contain the same figure. There is
only one correct way of solving this puzzle, which, if you discover, entitles you to a

ANNOUNCEMENT.
So great has been the demand for a larger package of Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery for use in hospitals and by
members of large families that the proprietors of this famous remedy
have now placed upon the market a Hospital Size of Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery for Coughs, Colds,
and Consumption.
This famous remedy is now used by all sufferers of chest com-
plaints from one end of Australia to the other, and it has always
been the object of the manufacturers of this preparation to keep the
price as low as possible, so as to put it within the reach of all
classes of the community. Heretofore this remedy has been sold in
only two sizes, one selling at Is. 6d., and the other, holding two-and-
a-half times as much, at 3s. The new package, the Hospital Size,
holds two-and-a-half times that contained by the 3s. size, so that
heads of large families and hospitals who use large quantities of this
preparation will find it to their advantage to buy same in the
Hospital Size at ss.
Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery
is to-day the most popular remedy for coughs and colds in Australasia,
and its wonderful success has undoubtedly been achieved on account
of the recognition of the fact by the public that it actually is what it
claims to be, a New Discovery, and something exceedingly superior
to the common cough mixture. Dr. Sheldon’s New Dis-
covery has been endorsed by thousands of prominent men and
women in every part of Australia. Many people who never before
would recommend a proprietary medicine have come forward and
voluntarily offered a testimonial for Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
This remedy is now obtainable everywhere throughout the Com-
monwealth, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, and South Africa, or will
be sent post free upon receipt of the price by Sheldon Drug Co.,
15 O’Connell Street, Sydney.
A CONVERSATION.
Q. I have been feeling very poorly lately, and have just been told by my doctor that I am
suffering from uric poisoning. I shall be glad if you will tell me just what uric poisoning means. Is it
a serious matter ?
A. Uric poisoning is caused by the retention in the blood of various substances which should
leave the body in solution. The retention of these substances is due to a diseased or inactive condition
of the kidneys. When the kidneys are working perfectly, they filter and extract from the blood of the
average individual about three pints of urine every day. In this quantity of urine should be dissolved
various waste material produced by the wear and tear of the tissues of the body. This is dead matter,
and its presence in the blood is poisonous. The three pints of normal urine should contain about ten
grains in weight of uric acid, an ounce of urea, together with other animal and mineral matter varying
from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce.
Q- Then lam to understand that the substances you mention when not eliminated from the
body in the natural manner constitute what is known as uric poisoning. What are the usual symptom?
by which the presence of these poisons is manifest ?
A. Now you are asking rather a large question. Many complaints which are commonly called
diseases are not actually diseases in themselves. For instance, Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Gravel, Stone, and Bladder Troubles are all caused by uric poisons.
Indigestion, Anaemia. Persistent Headache, and General Debility are often solely due to
the same cause. In fact, if the kidneys are doing their work freely and thoroughly, none of the com-
plaints mentioned could trouble us as the causative poisons would be absent.
Q. I had no idea that so much depended upon the efficient action of the kidneys. I suppose that
when anyone is suffering from Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Sciatica, Gravel,
Stone, Bladder Troubles, Anaemia, Debility, Persistent Headache, or Indigestion the
scientific method of effecting a cure would be to directly treat the patient for the kidneys ?
A. Exactly. In fact, that is the only way in which a radical and permanent cure can be effected.
The kidneys must be restored to health and activity, so that they may be enabled to remove the daily
production of poisons in the body, or the patient must continue to suffer.
Q. I have always been under the impression that the liver had a great deal to do with the main-
tenance of our general health, but it seems that the kidneys are the chief cause of most of the disorders
from which we suffer.
A. The work done by the liver is of the utmost importance and it is closely associated with the
work done by the kidneys. Indeed, when anything is the matter with the liver the kidneys are almost
always directly affected, and the contrary is likewise true. In the liver various substances are actually
made from the blood. Two or three pounds of bile are thus made every day. The liver takes sugar
from the blood, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able again to supply it to the
blood, gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble,
into urea_ which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles which have
lived their life and are useful no longer.
Q -^ s the functions of the kidneys and liver are so intimately related, I gather that if there is
reason to suspect that either organ is not doing its work efficiently a curative agent should be
employed which would act equally upon the kidneys and liver ?
A. Yes, that is the case, and it was the realisation of this important fact which led to the dis-
covery of that invaluable medicine Warner's Safe Cure. About thirty years ago, certain medical
men, knowing that if they could find a medicine which would beneficially affect alike the kidneys and
liver, they could control most of the common disorders, devoted themselves to the search for such a
remedy., After many disappointments, their efforts were rewarded, and a medicine now known as
Warner s baft; Eure was proved to possess the required properties in the fullest degree. Warner's
Safe Cure has a marvellously stimulating and healing effect upon both the kidneys and liver, and by
restoring those vital organs to health and activity, it necessarily cures all disorders due to the retention
in the blood of urinary and biliary poisons, such as
Rheumatism
Gout
Neuralgia
Lumbago
Sciatica
Blood Disorders
A nee mi a
Indigestion
Biliousness
Jaundice
Gravel
Stone
Bladder Troubles
General Debility
Sick Headache
Even Bright’s Disease, probably the most fatal of all diseases, yields to treatment by
Warner’s Safe Cure.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIM, KUM SING,” and the Mon-
golian’s beady eyes glanced at the bony
countenance and tall, gaunt, Salvarmy-
garbed figure of his interrogator. He pointed
towards a bloated form in a brown smock that was
hustling, with a rock of the shoulders, through his
lean, half-naked countrymen, as they crowded
into the semi-dark compartment. Then the
speaker’s eyes vanished in a mesh of wrinkles.
In a few seconds they stole insidiously out
again, furtively taking in the dogged twitch-
ing of the woman’s thin lips, and the
cold glitter of her pale-blue eyes as they
fastened on the object of her enquiry. Yet,
to all outward seeming, the woman was com-
placently gazing on the white-robed banker mov-
ing to and fro behind the massive wooden
balusters that reached from the smooth-worn
counter to the low, dingy ceiling, and divided the
chamber into two compartments. Presently
her eyes slowly wandered from the bloated figure
of Kum Sing, now leaning heavily against the
counter, and settled on the two placards affixed to
the otherwise naked wall, the one a local money-
bank’s guarantee that £5OO lay on deposit in the
name of Lee Kong; the other its duplicate in
Chinese—evidence enough in that Mongolian
quarter that Lee Kong’s gambling den was worthy
of patronage.
The squalid crowd suddenly ceased its cackle,
and its many eyes, brilliantly alight all at once
with the insatiable delirium of gambling, turned
towards the white-robed banker, who had
approached the balusters. The banker’s clerk,
also in a white robe, was seated at a mahogany
table, ticking off something in a book like a
ledger, under the luminous gleam of two huge
lamps. In a sing-song voice, not unlike some
religious chant, the banker began reading the
winning numbers of the tickets to an accompani-
ment of long sighs and many interjections and
lamentations from the gazing, wrinkled, yellow
crowd. The compartment reeked with the taint
of decayed vegetables, and of dried sweat that
clung to the stained garments and dilapidated
drab shirts —with the confused exhalations of acrid
breath, of bodies recently come from the manure
pits and from the pungent smoke of the opium
dens. The banker ceased and turned away, and
immediately the brilliant lights faded from the
slant eyes of his listeners. The compartment
rapidly emptied itself of all but the owners of
winning tickets, who breasted the counter. The
bloated figure of Kum Sing waddled out, closely
followed by the woman.
In the dark alley the woman quickened her
steps, as though to accost Kum Sing, but the
impulse died away, and she dropped behind him,
moving stealthily. Several times her eyes glanced
towards the starry strip above that slit in the be-
wildering bogglement of squat hovels that ex-
haled an effluvium as of drugs, and her lips
moved as though she were praying. On either
side of the alley, hutch-like doors kept opening
silently in the darkness as she passed, disclosing
under the flicker and glare of candles and slush
lamps hushed figures staring at gambling tables,
or white women crouching in passages, squatting
in corners, lounging in and out of kennel-like
dens. The Salvarmy woman noticed that, what-
ever they happened to be doing when the doors
opened, the livid faces invariably turned towards
the dark alley before they shut-to again. A
droning hum hung over the alley, frequently
diversified by cackles and sharp stabbing “ Yah !
Yahs ! ” The hot night pressed down like a cur-
tain. Slippered feet shuffled in and out of pas-
sages like tunnels.
All at once the woman stopped, staring at the
black aperture in the windowless flat wall through
which Kum Sing had disappeared. Then, stoop-
ing through it with a determined pluck at her
coarse dress, she ascended the narrow, foot-worn,
wooden staircase, guided by a guttering lamp
nailed to the wall at the top. A hot, greasy air
spumed into her face, making'her feel sick and
dizzy with its peculiar, nauseating pungency.
Holding her breath, she peered into the murkiness
of what appeared a cellar above ground. At first
she could only discern the tiny opium lamps set
near the mats, spread out in parallel rows the whole
length of theoblong wooden chamber. They pricked
with their spots of light the half-lifted gloom, and
reflected on the sluggish, black coils of smoke
loitering under the suffocating clouds near the
ceiling. Then the smokers gradually bulked on
her view. Each had his flat-bowled pipe, with its
long, thick bamboo stem, beside him—some of
them stretched out on their backs, some with
their legs curled up, and all of the appearance of
dried-up, attenuated anatomies awaiting the
varnish prior to being packed in cases and sent
to a museum. One grunted in his throat; another
sighed heavily; a third “Yay-yahed” wearily to
himself, with little sobbing sounds. Several
scarcely seemed to breathe at all.
On one side of the cellar was a row of bunks, all
empty but the one at the end, over which a slush
lamp hung flaring from the ceiling. There a
young woman lay with upturned face and shut
eyes. Beyond these bunks a spread of thick
canvas, suspended on rings driven into the wall,
concealed the entrance to an adjoining room.
When the Salvation Army woman’s eyes caught
sight of that colorless upturned face, a spasm
passed over her countenance. Then her lips
tightened, and she rapidly tiptoed between the
lines of recumbent figures towards the bunk. A
head bobbed up from a mat, and its blinking
eyes followed her. Another j utted into view from
the top of the staircase. She saw neither; her
eyes were fixed with wild intentness on the up-
turned face, devouring its every line. It seemed,
for the moment, as though some great passion
would flood her with tears or drive her to frenzy.
Then, craning her head till her lips almost touched
the sleeper’s ear, she tensely breathed :
“Lottie! ”
The occupant of the bunk seemed jerked into a
sitting posture by some hidden spring. Her eyes
were like those of a panic-stricken animal.
“It’s me. Come quick. Don’t speak—-they’ll
hear you,’’ whispered the other.
The young woman’s face was now of a corpse-
like pallor, and seemed to have become attenuated.
Her lips moved, but there was no sound.
The other’s eyes were blinded with tears, but
her lips were rigid as metal. She moistened her
lips with her tongue, and then whispered :
“Where are your things? Don’t speak loud.
Cod forgive me for what I did !” and she fumbled
among the blankets.
“ God ! It’s mother.” The words came as from
a cavern.
“ Hush ! Slip them on quick,” and she dragged
Lottie’s garments from the twisted blankets.
With the speed of lightning there leaped into
the young woman’s mind memories of her “ fall,”
her expulsion from her mother’s home in
Sydney, and the subsequent misery that scorched
her soul like flame till she drifted to this North
Queensland town and sank into the Pit. Her
eyes lost their panic-stricken stare and filled with
a sombre glow. Beads of perspiration appeared
on her brow. A dull resentment displaced her
heart’s abortive response to her mother’s
appeal, and struggled with a vague curiosity
as to why her mother (of all people!) wore
Salvarmy clothes—her mother, a prize-fighter’s
wife. Then a fierce desire to discharge
a volley of oaths at her, to heap abuse on
her, was baulked by inquisitiveness, by a
curious sense of homeliness at her mother’s pre-
sence, and by some slight stirring of her human
individuality so long suppressed by bestial condi-
tions. She watched her mother fingering her
jacket, and noted how her tears fell unheeded.
“ You’re sorry now, ain’t you ? ” she asked with
a little touch of triumph in her voice.
“ I wasn’t converted then. I didn’t know your
soul was going to perdition. See, here’s your
things.”
A shade of annoyance crossed Lottie’s face.
She petulantly pushed the garments aside.
“ You don’t want a thing like me. Pm no good.
You made me what I am, and you talk about my
soul. I’m not balmy, mother, if lam in hell. I’m
not coming.” Then hurriedly, as though
half-repenting her words, “ How did you know I
was here ? ”
A hard, determined expression had come into
the mother’s face as Lottie spoke. She replied,
however, in a conciliatory voice.
“ Through the Army. And I go back to Sydney
in to-morrow’s boat with you, if I’ve to carry you.”
The last six words were decisive in tone.
Lottie’s gratified sense of her new-found value to
someone was rudely overset by her old wayward
mood of defiance.
“You will!” Then with shrillness: “I’m my
own missis, thank you. You’ll take me to
Sydney ? What did you do to me when I was
there? Turned me out without a crust.”...
Then she exploded. The other gazed at her with
an expression half of stern pity, half of self-
condemnation.
The vehement pitch of words was all at once
clipped by the sharp voice of Kum Sing, who had
noiselessly approached from behind the canvas.
His little snake-like eyes darted furious light at
the silenced girl, who sank back cowering under
the shower of his needle-edged vocabulary.
Though the Salvarmy woman did not know what
had been said to her daughter, yet the pitiful
spectacle of her shivering under the blanket with
terrified eyes fixed on Kum Sing was evidence
enough. The mother’s sinews straightened with
their old agility, and her eyes were dried with a
smouldering fire behind their blue pallor.
“Whaffor you here, eh?”
Her eyes travelled rapidly over his broad body,
rancid with fat, and rested on his yellow, flat,
puffy face, dripping with sweat that shone under
the lamp flare like grease.
“ Pig 1"
The word fell pat, expressing deliberately, and
with contemptuous disgust, her cold summing up
of his appearance. His mammoth bulk heaved
like a blanket of blubber under the rush of his
fury.
“ Hit him, mother,” shrilled the young woman
as his swollen hands fell on the other’s shoulders.
His yell, when the woman’s bony fingers sank into
the rank flesh of his arms as into ripe cheese, died
into a suffocating gasp when her swiftly-uplifted
knee was violently projected into his capacious
paunch. He flew back against the wall with a
hollow boom, like the note of a smitten drum.
In a moment the cellar was like an overturned
ant-hill, alive with shouting yellow men, who
hurried in from unsuspected gaps and crannies.
Snatching her half-clad daughter from the bunk,
the mother bent forward and coolly tilted the
hanging lamp. A stream of blazing fat poured
spluttering on the blankets, and splashed into the
wild-eyed faces confronting her. Hands plucked
at her and smote as she fought her way in the
stampede to the staircase. Smoke eddied round,
and running flames hissed on the dried-up wall,
and grew into blown clouds around the rushing
figures. Borne helplessly on the panting, push-
ing, squeezing crowd that struggled foot by foot
in pitch darkness down the staircase, and dis-
charged its units, yelling like savages, into the
alley, the mother, still clutching her child,
staggered a few paces in the open air, fell on her
knees, and feebly sank forward, releasing her
burden.
“Mother, speak”
Clang! clang! went the fire-bell in the street
beyond. The crowd broke around the two figures
and swerved in its flight.
“Mother, don’t you hear me?” Then, as the
red soakage from the saturated corset pressed
warm and damp against her cheek, “ Help!
Help ! Murder ! Murder ! Murder ! ”
The yellow faces turned towards them, yet still
fled past. Smoke was now issuing from the roof
of the building in dense masses. A plume of fire
shot through it, hissing like a gigantic gas jet
under tremendous pressure. There was a roar
from the crowded street beyond, like the roar of
breaking billows. Still that dreadful cry of
“Murder ! ” never for a moment ceased.
A rush of helmeted figures through the alley
scattered the yellow mob like chaff.
“ Women ! ”
The big fireman was on his knees.
“What’s up, my lass? What ! stabbed?” The
rough fingers pressed tenderly on the elder
woman’s wrist. The other saw the compassionate
expression come into his bearded face as he gently
turned the white, fixed countenance towards the
increasing light of the fire, and her soul yearned
as she sobbed bitterly.
“ Hush, then ! She’s your mother, is she ? ” in
a tone wistfully soft and pitiful, and then in a
voice like a trumpet to a fireman hurrying past:
“ Hi! Jack, there’s a woman here stabbed ; help
us to shift her.” Then, cheerily: “Don’t cry,
lass, we’ll pull her round.” And finally, with a
great volume of human heartiness : “ Blast them
Chows!”
The two fugitives were carried off to the young
one’s whimpering refrain: “My poor mother, my
poor murdered mother.”

A SYDNEY WOMAN.
Mrs. F. May, 48 Newland-street, Waver-
ley, says, on February 2, 1907: —“I have
read the testimonial which I gave eight
years ago, stating my good opinion of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I can
truthfully say that every word is correct,
and I have still the same good opinion of
this remedy. I had contracted a severe
chill across the loins, and for a couple of
years suffered with lumbago-like pains in
the small of my back ; I also had a touch of
rheumatism. But Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills cured me, and I am still quite free
from every symptom of kidney complaint.
I have recommended this great kidney
remedy to numbers of sufferers, and all
endorse my good opinion of it.”
A SYDNEY MAN.
Mr. Mark Tierney, 6 Darling-street,
Glebe, says:—“Dor a considerable time I
have been subject to severe pains across the
small of my back, at times extending down
the loins. I was always using liniments, but
can’t say much for the results. I could not
rest comfortably at night, and thus had in-
sufficient sleep. I saw Doan s Backache
Kidney Pills advertised, and procured some.
The first few doses eased my pain, and, after
taking a course, I was thoroughly cured.’
Mrs. Tierney confirms the above, eight
years later :— “My husbands cure of back-
ache has proved permanent. I also have
used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for back-
ache, and they perfectly cured me.”

Eczema,
Nothing spoils a good disposition quicker.
Nothing taxes a man’s patience
Like any irritation of the skin.
Piles almost drive you mad,
All day they make you miserable,
All night they keep you awake.
Just the same with Eczema.
Such miseries are daily decreasing.
People are learning they can be cured.
Learning the merit of Doan’s Ointment.
Plenty of proof that Doan’s Ointment will
cure
Eczema, Piles, or any irritation of the skin.
Here is Sydney testimony :
Mr. H. Boyd, 8 St. Andrew’s-street, Bal-
main, Sydney, says:—“My little boy has
suffered with Eczema ever since he was six
months old. He was very bad, indeed ; we
had to muffle his hands, and cover his head,
to keep him from scratching. The irrita-
tion was frightful, especially at night time,
after he had been put to bed. We were
always using one remedy or another, but
nothing seemed able to give him relief until
we got Doan’s Ointment. A friend advised
me to use this preparation ; she had used it
with great success on one of her children, and
told me that she was quite sure it would do
my boy good. Six boxes effected a complete
cure ; not a sign of the ailment remains. It
acted marvellously from the first, every ap-
plication giving instant relief.
Mrs. Boyd says, three years later, ‘My
little boy is still free of the Eczema. It is
not posssible for a remedy to do more than
Doan’s Ointment has done for him a per-
fect and permanent cure.”
No need for any one to suffer with Eczema,
or any other torturing skin disease, for
Doan’s Ointment is a positive cure. Ihen
get this remedy to day, and put an end to
your suffering. Doan’s Ointment is sold by
all chemists and storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per
pot, or will be posted on receipt of price by
Foster-McClellan Company, 76 Pitt-street,
Sydney.

Soul-Flights.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE roseate last tints die,
And night, with its mysteries,
Is lord of a realm of sky
And the world and the silent trees.
Night touches the old earth’s scars
And bruises, and makes them whole ;
And the soul goes out to the stars,
For this is the hour of the soul.
She hid all day from the stark
And staring life of the town ;
As a flower that blooms in the dark,
She breathed when the night came down.
Siie hearkens with yearning ears—
A wonderful, wistful ghost—
And hears the hymn of the spheres
That chant in the Uttermost.
She sails on the golden lakes
Of lonely worlds withdrawn,
What time a glory breaks
In alien skies at dawn.
She hastens her flight afar,
A spirit overjoyed,
To that lone outpost star
That fronts the Appalling Void.
And there her greetings fail,
And there her flight is stayed,
And she grows tense and pale,
And cold and all afraid.
And there, in dire distress,
She calls, while shadows loom ;
The Gulf lies answerless—••
A mighty unlit gloom.
How came the soul that sees
Such things on earth to dwell ?
How can she be at ease
With them that buy and sell?
The house is very small
For such a guest of north ;
And when vast Voices call
She hears and hurries forth.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f s.s. Paddymelon lay at the wharf.
I It was Sunday, and hot. On its decks
were crates crammed full of fowls and
ducks, in a gasping condition. There was no one
stirring aboard, and when the new Inspector of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Brutes came sauntering along the quay, his blood
boiled at this case of rank neglect.
Stepping hastily up the gangway, he went to
the saloon companion and hailed. Getting no
response from that quarter, he went to the fo’c’sle
scuttle and called again. Again no reply. Appa-
rently the vessel was deserted.
Inspector Smith was a tender-hearted man. He
filled a tin pannikin and tried to give the fowls a
drink through the bars of their box. Finding
this method only partly successful, he decided to
take a batten off the crate, and replace it after
watering the suffering hens. He managed to get
the batten off—in fact, he succeeded too well and
dragged two off—and before he could do anything
to prevent the disaster, the fowls flew and walked
and fell out of the crate. There seemed to Smith
to be thousands of them, and, after chasing several
gangs about the main deck, he stopped to medi-
tate. Then it dawned on him that, with the
exception of the fowls and ducks, no one had
observed his act. In addition to his tender-
heartedness, Smith was practical. He fled.
The fowls, rejoicing in their liberty, proceeded
to make the most of it. One broody hen mounted
the starboard bulwark, and seeing a smooth, level
backyard of immense size, with bits of biscuit
scattered all over it, she gave a shrill squawk and
flew down. Her astonishment on alighting was
beyond expression. People who say fowls can’t
swim ought to have seen that hen. She simply
floated, and, after all, it was cooler than the hot
deck.
The boss rooster of the crate soon found the
steps leading to the bridge, and, mounting them,
paced back and forth, crowing defiance. An ex-
ploring pullet found the gangway, and swept
daintily down to the wharf with a graceful imita-
tion of larger and more human females.
At sunset the fowls began to look for a perch for
the night. Some climbed to the highest ratlins.
The boss rooster, after a last defiant crow, hopped
on to the telegraph, and roosted there. The dainty
pullet perched on the gangway rope, and the
broody hen in the water found a stray piece of
wood alongside her, and succeeded in mounting
it. She sat there wobbling a little, and the boss
rooster looked down at her with an expression
which seemed to say : “ Do I know you ?”
Night fell. The ducks saved up their thirsts till
the morrow, and all was peace on the Paddy-
melon. The moon rose about 10 o’clock, and the
boss rooster challenged it with a hoarse, crow,
which was echoed and repeated by spectral
roosters in different parts of the vessel.
The form of the ship’s cook appeared coming
along the wharf. He walked quickly towards the
Paddymelon, and started up the gangway. His
hand touched the pullet and she shrieked. The
man grasped the ratlins in his surprise, and shook
loose all the fowls perched thereon. They flew
and flapped down upon him, while the boss
rooster on the bridge cackled furiously. The cook
was unsober, and not fitted to stand shocks. He
uttered a brief howl, and, like Mr. Smith, he fled.
He was in such a hurry that he threw his pipe
away as he ran. It went into the water and hit
the wet hen. Her excited shriek added pace to
his going.
In the morning the fowls rose early and went
across the road to a restaurant for breakfast. The
restaurant was shut, fortunately for them, and
they had a cold collation in the gutter. Then
they returned to the wharf, and when the
steamer’s crew came down to work the cargo they
were all perched in a line on the wharf stringer,
watching the broody hen in the water. They were
evidently discussing her from a social point of
view, and the boss rooster still had that wonder-
ing reminiscent expression on his beak, as though
he were trying to bring her to mind.
WILL LOWSON.
If There Hadn’t Been Mary.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ T—I’YE never done it before,” she said.
Neither had 1 ; but I would have been
quite willing to keep on doing it—if there
hadn’t been Mary to remember. She snapped a
gum-twig with her little pink fingers.
“It’s so hard to make a beginning,” she ex-
plained.
“Shouldn’t be,” I told her. “ Everybody is
making them every day. And everything has
one.”
“A ring hasn’t,” she said.
And then I knew that she was really a girl, and
not a water-witch come from the fern-creek
below. So I waited for the beginning, and we
looked at each other.
She was better worth looking at than I. For I
was trying a new turnip-drill in the forty acres,
and the day was red-hot, with just enough wind
to lift the dust. I hadn’t shaved for two days
either. But I had left my horses when she called
to me from the shade of the weeping gum.
She was like—l don’t quite know what she was
like. I would have learned, though—if there
hadn’t been Mary.
“ Let’s see, ” she said underbreath. “You ask
questions ”
“ You do,” I told her. “ I’m only being inter-
viewed, remember.”
“ I said ‘ I.’ When you say ‘ you ’ like that you
don’t mean ‘you ’ and, and please don’t stare
at me that way.”
“ I’m sorry,” I apologised. “ But I don’t know
any other way. If I had your eyes ”
I had been trying to see their color all the time.
But I didn’t even then. She blushed, and I
remembered Mary with all my powers.
“ I—thought it would be rather nice. But it’s
just like going round selling buttons and tape,
isn’t it ? ” she said.
“Exactly,” I agreed, not understanding in the
least.
“ Oh,” she cried. “ You are horrid ! I might
have known you’d insult me ! They said you were
a woman-hater, but ”
I had never heard a more unfounded libel in my
life, and I told her so. But I was yet unforgiven.
“I decline to interview you any more,” she
said.
I took her note-book. I might have taken her
hand if—
“l will interview myself, then,” I said. “I
decline to be uninterviewed. Ah. ... er... .”
The note-book had a row of questions scribbled
down the page. I read out the first.
“ Is he good-looking?” (It was quite certainly
the first time she had done it.)
I looked at her. And she had the daintiest
color—
“ You can’t answer that yourself,” she said.
“ I’ll put it down when I get home.”
“Indeed, I should much prefer to answer that
one myself,” I said. “ Besides, you might forget.”
“If I forget I’ll put you down ‘ good-looking,”’
she said.
Mary’s retorts are never two-edged. They
are all on top—like a flounder. But I put down
“ Yes ” in case she didn’t forget, and went on to
the next, “ Married or single ?”
“ A bit of both,” I said.
“ Please explain.”
“ I’m engaged. Very much engaged indeed.”
I thought I saw a flash of pity in her eyes.
But I did not catch their color. Not even when
she sat on the old fallen stringy-bark and I lay on
the baked grass and looked up at her.
“ And then there are politics,” she said, later.
“Of course,” I said, fqr I had recently been
elected member for the district. This was what
had made me famous.
“Are you—are you Government or . . . the
other ? ”
I knew that she didn’t know what the other
was, and this hurt me.
“The other,” I said, handing over the book.
“Put it down, please.”
She shook her head. Her hair was gold where
the tips caught the sun.
“You are interviewing yourself,” she said.
“ And a gentleman never goes back on his word.”
I looked away from the curves of her mouth.
Of course he doesn’t.
“ Then—religion ?” she suggested.
“ I believe in Cupid and Venus,” I said.
She flashed one look at me. It was worth
startling her for.
“ They are myths,” she said.
“Mythological,” I corrected. “When a myth
becomes logical it means that it is true, but it
can’t be proved.”
“ A true thing can always be proved.”
“ I wish it could. But, for instance, it might
be true that I admired someone very much ; but
I can’t prove it to her.”
She did not ask why. And I had an answer
ready, too.
“ Put that down and go on to the next, ’ she
said. .
I put it down, and I wondered if old Hartley
of the Examiner had sent her. But Bildidge of
the N ews would be just as wild.
“ The next is,” I said, “ ‘ What is his chief
interest ? ’ and I will not give you the answer.”
“Why not?”
“Because I don’t know if they are violet or
blue.”
“ What!”
The big sweet eyes were rounded for a moment.
I forgot Mary.
“ Thank you,” I said ; “ they are Heaven s own
blue. I might have known it.”
She stood up, and her lip was trembling.
“They said you were a woman-hater,” she
cried. “ And you are—you are No one else
Qould possibly be so horrid. They can send a man
with a smelling pipe next time. I won’t interview
a woman-hater.” _
“ I’m not,” I cried, vehement as herself. ‘ Un
my honor, I’m not. Truly—but it s one of those
true things that can’t be proved.”
I would have proved it to her, though—if there
hadn’t been Mary.
“ Give me my book, please.”
“ Hold on. The next question asks if lam con-
versational. Am I ? You ought to know.
“I know,” she said, “ that your conversation is
as disagreeable as your books, Mr. Harris^ and
that is saying a good deal. Good afternoon.
She dipped down the steep track to the fern-
gully with the grace of a flying bird, and I dropped
on the log.
“ The—devil! ” I said. .
For my name is Harrison, and Harris the writer
is staying at the station beyond. But this was a
far better interview than she would have got out
of Harris. He’s sixty. I would have gone after
her to tell her so—if there hadn’t been Mary.
She needn’t have called me a woman-hater,
though.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is a wonderful medicine- We
give bellow the testimony of a grateful husbands
)J0?
whip*
m
“My wife has all her life long been
subject to rush of blood to the head
and fainting-fits. In later years these
were more frequent, and her skin be-
came very sallow. She had scarcely
any appetite, and it was not safe to
leave her at home by herself for fear
of a fainting-fit. I may state we had
medical advice both in England and
here in New Zealand, but it did no
good; so, some months back, I sug-
gested that she take Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. She protested against it, be-
lieving it to be quackery, but I pur-
chased a bottle just to give it a trial,
and the result was marvelous. Mrs.
Moul has taken five bottles, and now
she ia a new creature.
“I forward you her photo by this mail, and you can make what use
you think proper of this statement. Yours gratefully.” — John F.
Moul, Ty-Coed, Swanson, Auckland.
“P.S. I omitted stating that the photo was taken since using the
Sarsaparilla.”
Be sure you get the right kind of Sarsaparilla —-“AYER’S.” Don’t
let anybody induce you to try some other kind. You will regret it
if you do.
If you are not in good, vigorous health, if your nerves are not so
strong as you wish, if you are feeling run down and depressed, buy
AYER’S Sarsaparilla
today and begin the certain cure.
