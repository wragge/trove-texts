Writes ‘Florence’—
As an ardent Carrollist do let me have my say in reply
to Louise Mack. The key to her appreciation or non-
appreciation of ‘ Alice ’ lies in her last sentence, ‘ It is too
hard a problem for the little ones to solve.’ The child
who takes Wonderland seriously may as well give it up
ft together. If he or she wants ‘ prompting from an
older mind’ to understand the inhabitants of Looking-
Glass Land, then Carrollism is a stumbling-block and a
foolishness to that matter-of-fact juvenile. Why, it’s
the i ery sedateness,’ the very ‘ absence of clue,’ that
makes the abiding charm of the books. Carroll is the
children’s Rabelais. He belongs to the great and glorious
army of the irresponsibles of literature. And the irre-
sponsible is born, not made. It’s a quality of mind
that can never be gained by culture or education.
The quality is innate and the child instinctively accepts
•Alice, as he or she accepts Sancho Panza and Princess
Zobeide and Haroun Al-Raschid and all other impossi-
bihties whose absurd deeds ‘might be the ludicrous i
possibility of impossible dreams’; or the quality is n
innate—and the child-reader prefers little ‘Fauntlero
and ‘ What Katie Did.’ Be gustibus, etc. But when t e
child is one of the irresponsibles he recognises his
mates inside the covers of books, and loves them, ai
knows all the while with an understanding deeper dow
than any ‘prompting from a grown-up ’ that they are no i
real.’ Do you think an imaginative child wants the
to be ‘real?’—to be anything but belong to the Im
mortals, although they are ‘nothing ; less than nothing
and dreams,’ as Chas. Lamb says about JUs dream
children. But Chas. Lamb would have understoo
Carroll.

There are many, doubtless, who will regard this study

Nicholson—one of the so-called ‘Beg
garstaff Brothers,' whose original and ecoentrio
posters are so well-known-one day determined to
draw the Prince of Wales’s celebrated horse, and
to engrave the woodblock with his own hand; his
first attempt. The elementary character of the engrav-
ing, therefore, may he assumption, but. it is certainly
not affectation. It is needless to call attention to the
tine drawing of the horse, or to the quaintneas of the
arrangement; or even to apologise for the presentation
of this impression to the readers of ‘The Magazine of Art.’
It is included as one fbrra of modern decadence ; highly

the play which he conceived while in prison. He lives in
the Latin quarter and takes his meals in the famous Caf<s
Procope, where he is always surrounded by a host of
friends. The story is told in Paris that one evening
when Wilde entered the little Voltaire room of the caffe,
the small iron Venus that stands on a shelf where Vol

he set foot in the room. The explanation made is that i

In More Tramps Abroad ’ Mark Twain relates
a discussion between three Scots at table d'hdte as
to whether the Scotch peasantry pronounced the
word three ’ three or throw. One Scot held out
tor three ; the others were firm for throw.
The solitary Scot was having a sultry time of it, so
thought I would enrich him with my help. In my posi-
tion I was necessarily quite impartial, and was as equally
as well and as ill-equipped to fight on the one side as the
other. So I spoke up, and said the peasantry pronounced
it three, not throw. It was an error of judgment. There
was a moment of astonished and ominous silence, then
weather ensued. The storm rose and spread in a sur-
prising way, and I was snowed under in a very few
minutes. It was a had defeat for me ; a kind of Waterloo.
It promised to remain so, and I wished I had had better
sense than to enter upon such a forlorn enterprise. But
Just then I had a saving thought, at least a thought that
offered a chance. While the storm was still raging I
made up a Scotch couplet, and then spoke up and said :
Very well, don t say any more, I confess defeat I
thought I knew, but I see my mistake. I was deceived
by one of your Scotch poets.’
‘ A Scotch poet 1 Oh, cornel Name him.’
‘Robert Burns.’
It is wonderful the powtir of that name. These men
looked doubtful—but paralysed all the same. They were
quite silent for a moment; then one of them said, with
the reverence in his voice which is always present in a
I Scotchman’s tone when he utters the name—
‘ Does Robbie Burns say —what does he say?’
‘ This is what he says :
There were nae bairns but only three—
Ane at the breast, twa at the knee.
It ended the discussion. There was no man there pro-
fane enough, disloyal enough, to say any word against a
thing which Robert Burns had settled. I shall always
honor that great name for the salvation it brought me in
tins time of my sore need. M rae 1,1
It is my belief that nearly any invented ouotaHon

There are people who think that honestv is always the

a small boy, I never doubted its truth. The story was
“ **" I ,lv >sible D mon,” and related how several
persons had bee,, found unaccountably strangled in the

SURGEON LANGSTON, M.R.C.S., Eng.,
THE GREATEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL PRACTI-
TIONER IN THE WORLD.
But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emin-
ence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed
in an acute or chronic case of long standing, where other
physicians have failed. He addresses himself in particular
to cases that have baffled the skill and science of other
doctors. His name is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect
cure of every case he undertakes. Consult him this day.
It may save you much mental and physical suffering, and
add golden years to your life.
YOUNG MEN. You will find this distinguished doctor
your best friend and benefactor. If you are troubled
with want of sleep, a tired, gloomy feeling, and loss
of energy, which impair both your body and brain,
and absolutely unfit you for study, business, or the
proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering from these
or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN. There are many of you afflicted
with weak, aching back and kidneys, loss of mental and
physical power and vigor, and not unfrequentlr accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated
that in all such cases of middle-aged men, as well of
young men, his success has been almost invariable

most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the

33r. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN
DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
ah aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fearof something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&0., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps he will send
(POST FREE)
A Complete Medical Work,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
One Pound is sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, Do Not Delay,

in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
Dr. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to _fully describe your case, send 6d. in

questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST.
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Hr. YV. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and 1 got so weak
that I could not leave-my bed. -At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from Asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
1 quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cured me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and s!>
other leading residents.

whose New and Scientific Treatment, by purifying and
enriching the blood, gives new life and tone to the
whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE
ensures a thorough and LASTING CURE.
MEN
Should try Dr. SPEER’S celebrated Remedies, which strike
at the root of the disease. The symptoms gradually dis-
appear, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.
A till CONSULTATIONS FREE.
Persons residing at a distance can, by describing their
troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of
treatment will not in any way interfere with their
business.
Every person applying to the Doctor will receive a
straightforward and candid opinion of the case, and the
possibility of a cure. If the patient is curable, he will tell
him so ; if not, he will also tell him. He undertakes no
case which he cannot cure.

the weakened muscles and cords that builds up the weak
parts and makes the cure complete. It is the one grand

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From an English paper :
For the first time for over twenty years Llanilar Petty
Sessions, in North Cardiganshire, on Friday had no
affiliation cases.
And the Nonconformist conscience is specially
prominent in Wales. Sex and Sanctity again.
Melb. War Crv is a rich fund of informa-
tion, anyhow. It announces, in a recent issue,
the death of J. L. Pearson, C.M.G., “ an eminent
ecclesiastical architect who built IVestminster
Abbey, and other celebrated buildings in England.”
Pearson seems to have gone to the Golden Shore
at the good old age of 825 next birthday, or there-
abouts.
THE DANCE AT JELLICOE'S.
Old Jellicoe was popular throughout the district
wide,
And still more was his daughter Sue along the
countryside ;
So when the “invites” floated round to roll up to
a dance
That he would give on such a date, all gladly
seized the chance.
A stretch of country lay between the homesteads
on each farm,
But what was that to youthful hearts, with blood
and spirits warm ?
The lucky folks invited there would wade through
floods and snows
In order not to miss that treat—a dance at
Jellicoe’s.
The ample barn had profited by contact with the
broom,
And lanterns with their tallow dips were fastened
round the room ;
A youth—a sort of Hoyle—had bought some can-
dles at the store,
And whittled them to shavings, which he scattered
on the floor.
Bill Jenkins took the M.C.’s part, and music loud
and strong,
Played on his big accordeon, was catered by Jim
Long ;
And forty people for a time forgot their cares and
woes,
And gave their sole attention to that dance at
Jellicoe’s.
Oh ! how we danced that winter’s night, and what
a time we had !
Until an accident occurred that made the dancers
mad ;
For when Bill Jenkins schottisched past with
Susan Jellicoe,
Into Jim Long’s accordeon went Bill’s erratic
toe !
Of course the music ceased at once, and then the
dancing, too,
And everyone looked thunderstruck, and Jim
seemed pretty blue;
Till, to our joy, the dancing Hoyle suggested
then and there
That glue and some brown paper would the
damages repair.
No sooner said than carried out, and all were once
again
In high glee flying round the room, but to a shaky
strain ;
Bill Jenkins no more ambled near the orchestra so
frail,
For Jim was glaring in a way that prophesied a
gale.
But Fate had evidently willed that we should all
retire,
For Tom Smith, in a polka, kicked the music in
the fire ;
And, as the instrument blazed up, it threw out
ruddy glows
That seemed to tell us all was o’er —the dance at
Jellicoe’s !
Though now I oft attend a ball in swallow-tail
attire,
I sometimes gaze across the room, and want to
Bee that fire ;
And though the music’s very good, played by a
band of four,
For Jim and his accordeon I look towards the
door.
In fancy still I see the room, and hear Bill Jenkins
call
The figures out of every dance, his back against
the wall ;
And then the spots of candle-grease we sported at
the close—
A frequent decoration from a dance at Jellicoe’s !
’Twas more than thirty years ago, and what a
change I see !
A town is standing where we had that dance in
’O3 !
Bill Jenkins is a member of our local House of
Peers,
And Jim now does a thriving trade in “ shandy-
gaffs ” and beers.
Our dancing Hoyle has joined the church, Tom
Smith is now a knight,
And Susan Jellicoe now reads these memories as
I write;
And, though I’m not a millionaire, still, anybody
knows
That what 1 have I owe it to that dance at
Jellicoe’s !

The Human Inside and Other Matters.
It seems probable that South Australia will
shortly follow the moral example of Queens-
land, and legislate in a severe grandmotherly
spirit about the obnoxious medical and
patent-medicine advt. One immediate con-
sequence will be that the newspapers will
lose a lot of revenue, and another result will
be that the public will miss a great deal of
interesting reading about its own inside.
And this will undoubtedly deprive life of
much of its savour. It is generally agreed
in serious - minded Sunday - school circles
that the inside is a beastly rude subject.
Also, anyone who has seen it is aware that
it is wet and complicated and unpicturesque,
and looks just like the thing that a dog runs
away with out of the butcher’s shop with the
butcher-man objurgating behind. Its chief
use, conversationally, lies in the fact that it
is the thing which the larrikin habitually
says he will kick out of the other larrikin if
the other larrikin doesn’t leave off interfer-
ing with his girl. But, at the same time,
the average person finds a certain fearsome
interest in reading about his inside, and the
awful state it may be in, and the much more
awful state it will quickly get into if he
doesn’t take somebody’s great remedy im-
mediately.
* * * •
The subject has all the thrill that naturally
attaches to the unknown. To the ordinary
individual, his own inside is as much an un-
discovered world as the one which Columbus
went to look for. He has no idea at all
what it looks like, but the horrible things it
may look like are too numerous to mention.
And if he loses the patent-medicine advt.
and the full printed description of how he
feels when he doesn’t feel well, something
will be gone out of his daily life—not that
this matters much. At the same time, the
tendency of legislation on the subject is
illogical and difficult to understand. Un-
doubtedly the great bulk of patent-medicines
are frauds, pure and simple. Some of them
are merely a ha’porth of something perfectly
useless, which has astonishing lies attached
to it, and is sold for 3s. 9|d. Some of them
contain a small quantity of some cheap and
simple drug in daily use by all doctors and
chemists, which drug the medicine-man de-
clares he has personally discovered after 63
years, or thereabouts, of eye-blinding re-
search on the plains of Gibraltar, or else-
where, and which he sells at a dead loss for
ss. 7£d. As for the man who appeals to the
man who doesn’t feel well, he only does for
him, often very badly, and almost always at
three times the regular charge, what any
regular practitioner would do. But curi-
ously enough, the law doesn’t propose to
, deal with these swindlers. All it proposes
to do is to prohibit the swindlers making un-
gentlemanly allusions in their advertisements
to the human inside, the latter being a
shocking thing, and quite too dreadful to
mention.
* * * *
The inside, according to all orthodox
religion, is the direct work of Providence.
If it is long and damp, and its colors are of the
impressionist variety, Providence alone is
responsible; and Providence, being wise
beyond all other institutions, saw that it was
best that it should be long and damp. Under
these circumstances, it is difficult to see any
reason why the inside shouldn’t be publicly
alluded to, provided it is done respectfully,
and in such a manner as will not cause the
public to fly from its breakfast-bacon with a
shudder. And the fact that strange and
awful things are liable to happen to the
human inside, and that these things cause it
to become even more moist and complicated
and discolored than usual, was also presum-
ably devised by Providence— at least, it is
difficult to imagine that anything less wise
than Providence could have discovered so
many ways in which so small a thing could
go wrong. Therefore it is difficult to see
why these things also should not be
respectfully mentioned for public informa-
tion. If the information is used as a vehicle
for swindling, there is good reason for putting
down the swindle—not the information. Yet
strangely enough the tendency of modern
snuffle law is to put down the information—
not the swindle. Where a person advertises
quite truthfully that certain things are liable
to go wrong with (say) the bowels, and adds
falsely that they can be cured by his ten-
and-sixpenny pills, which are only sawdust,
and he thereby defrauds people of their
money and also causes their death by lead-
ing them to trust to the said sawdust pills
till they are past cure, there is obviously
something wrong. And the trend of legisla-
tion in Queensland, S.A., and elsewhere, is
to condone the swindle and the murder, but
to come down heavily on the fraudulent
practitioner for alluding to anything so un-
gentlemanly as bowels. If he contrives to
convey the information in a different form,
and can work the same swindle and the same
murder without alluding to bowels, the law
will be quite satisfied.
♦ * * *
All this, it seems to The Bulletin, is a
ridiculous fashion of beginning at the wrong
end, and trying to suppress the tail of the
animal instead of the head. The first thing
that wants putting down is not the quack and
the patent - medicine advt. but the quack
and the patent-medicine themselves. As re-
gards the latter the way out of the diffi-
culty is easy enough. First of all, every
patent-medicine should be officially analysed
and reported on by the best medical autho-
rity before its sale is permitted. If it is
worthless or injurious, its sale should be pro-
hibited, and any one trading in it should be
fined £lOO for the first offence, and £5OO for
the second, and more afterwards. If it has
any virtues, it should only be sold or adver-
tised with a copy of an official certificate
attached, said certificate stating what it con-
sists of and the class of disease for which it
is beneficial. If the owner thinks himself
aggrieved by the official description of his
medicine, he should have all possible powers
of appeal to a board consisting of the highest
chemical talent, but unless he can prove his
nostrum to be beneficial the law should be
absolutely inexorable. Any person found
advertising or selling his compound, even
after it passes the board, as a specific for
everything, or for anything outside its scope,
should rank with any other individual who
gets money by false pretences, and be fined
say £lOO for the first offence, and £5OO for the
second, and more afterwards. As regards
the medico, or alleged medico, whose adver-
tisements contain shocking allusions to the
human inside, a cast-iron law against all
practitioners who can’t prove the possession
of a certain minimum quantity of medical
knowledge would wipe out the great bulk of
the advertisers. And, having thus extin-
guished the greater part of the evil by the
summary extinction of the evil-doers, it
would be time enough to consider how far
the very small remainder could be allowed to
publicly comment on the entrails of this
rising nation without spoiling its breakfast.
♦ * * *
In Germany and some other countries a
practical-minded race does take almost ex-
actly such precautions. In England there
are practically no precautions, and Australia
follows England’s lead. The law holds that,
though a man is entitled to protection
against the swindler who sells him an
envelope with a halfpenny in it, the said coin
being alleged to be a sovereign, he isn’t
entitled to any protection against the much
worse swindler who sells him a bottle of
colored water alleging that it contains an
infallible remedy for phthisis or Bright’s
disease. The latter is incalculably the worse
liar and swindler of the two, inasmuch as he
attacks the public where it is least defensible ;
any man can tell whether a coin is copper
or gold ; but 999 men in every 1000 have
no personal knowledge of the contents of the
bottle, and have to take it on trust. Also,
where the ordinary spieler preys mostly on
the healthy, the other fiend lives by swind-
ling the sick and dying ; and he causes
many deaths simply because people trust to
him and his glozing advt. until they are past
cure. In addition to all this he is a vastly
larger swindler than all the spieling and con-
fidence and three-card fraternity combined.
* * * *
The chief reason for the wondrous immu-
nity he has experienced seems to be the
feeling that it is rude to argue about the
inside, but now that the law is commencing
to argue about it, this paper cordially re-
commends that the argument should begin
at the right end. The average paper un-
doubtedly contains far more allusions to the
human bowel and liver than make pleasant
reading, considering how flabby and unpic-
turesque and damp these organs are. The
allusions are all combined wich announce-
ments that the said organs are in a dreadful
state, and can only be cured by the use of
somebody’s mixture at a great deal and
sixpence for not much. The shortest way
to suppress this unpleasant meat-reading is
to enact the compulsory official analysis
and control of all these mixtures. Those
which were absolutely condemned—probably
nine-tenths of the lot—would disappear en-
tirely, and the bulk of the remainder would
probably be only allowed to appear there-
after as simple tonics. As for the alleged
specialists, a rigid process of examination
would wipe out most of them. If any of the
men and medicines survived the ordeal and
proved to be really what they pretended,
then the public, which has stood so much
and stood it so long, could probably put up,
without absolute demoralisation, with the
small amount of liver and bowel advt. which
they would imply. The great advantages to
be gained would, perhaps, justify that limited
amount of sin. But when it is proposed to
let the heartless patent-medicine swindler
continue to defraud the ill and dying, and to
live on the hope deferred which maketh the
heart sick, and to be an assassin as well as a
thief, and yet the law which permits all this
proposes to prohibit public allusion to the
inside with which man has been supplied by
Providence, that law is a pretty bad kind
of hypocrite and ass.
New South Wales Civil Service Trouble.
It is one of the standing boasts of the present
New South Wales Government that it has
made, per medium of its new Public Service
Board, large savings in the cost of running the
various departments of the State. What these
savings are, assuming that there really is any
saving in the aggregate, no one really knows,
but if any reliance is to be placed on the report
of the Parliamentary Select Committee which
recently investigated the matter, many of the
alleged economies have been made in a fashion
that the country should be bitterly ashamed of.
Anybody trying to economise, regardless of all
other considerations, in the New South Wales
Public Service needs to keep two ends particu-
larly in view. One is to cut down the annual
outlay in salaries, either by reducing the pay
of public servants, or by reducing their number,
or by doing both these things at once. The
other is to reduce the liabilities of the Superan-
nuation Fund by justly or unjustly bouncing as
many as possible of the public servants out of
their claims upon it. The Superannuation
Fund, it is well known, is utterly insolvent, and
is fast becoming exhausted. When it finally
breaks down, some Ministry will have to
earn dreadful unpopularity, and lose a lot
of votes by (1) repudiating the claims
of public servants and swindling them out
of the pensions and allowances which
they have been paying for under compulsion for
many years past, or (2) by floating an utterly
unprofitable loan of £2,000,000 or so to keep
the funcT on its legs, or (.3) by charging the
pensions and allowances against taxation.
Therefore, there is as much need to cut down,
by fair or unfair means, the possible claims on
the Superannuation Fund, as to cut down the
immediate outgoings in the way of salaries.
* * * *
The main features of the case are these :
Every permanent public officer was compelled
until very recently to subscribe to the Superan-
nuation Fund. In return he was promised a
pension on a certain fixed scale if he x’etired
after 15 years’ service through ill-health, the
abolition of his office, or through attaining age
60. If he retired or was retrenched under
other conditions he \vacS entitled to a gratuity
not exceeding one month’s pay for each year of
service, which gratuity is generally a very
much smaller burden on the Fund than the
pension. “Temporary” public officers (an
officer might be 30 years in the service and be
only “ temporary,” while another might be
there only six months doing the same work and
be “ permanent ” —there is a certain hazy dis-
tinction between the two classes that is hard to
trace) could only obtain, on the recommenda-
tion of the Public Service Board, a gratuity
not exceeding one fortnight’s pay for each year
of service. The term “ gratuity,” by the way,
is insulting and misleading. Where a man
compulsorily pays for his own gratuity it isn’t
a gratuity.
* * * *
The Committee alleges, in the first place, that
the Board suddenly and violently fired out
several very old public servants of good charac-
ter and charged with no offence, when they
were on the verge of the pension age, and thui
deprived them of the pensions for which they
had paid during many weary years. One man,
with 20 years* service, would have had a claim
for a pension after another five months. He
was effectually prevented from qualifying by
prompt ejection ! and the Superannuation Fund
was, presumably, saved a considerable burden.
Auother had about 40 years’good service to his
credit, and was within 1J years of the pension
age. He was also “ tired ” out in time to save
the pension ! Another had over 29J years’
service to his credit, and was just four months
off his pension. Also, he had six months holi-
day due him according to the fixed custom of
the service, which, if he had obtained it, would
have carried him over the date when his pen-
sion fell due. It is alleged that he applied for
the holiday, but the Public Service Board seems
to have got over the difficulty by discharging him
first and refusing his leave of absence after-
wards !! However pure the Board’s motives may
havebeen in cases like these, nothing will prevent
the public imagining that these men, after being
compelled to pay for their pensions by many
years’ continuous subscription to the fund, were
ejected from the service to save the fund the
expense of meeting their just claims.
* • * •
A few cases, as quoted in the Committee’s
report. All the persons in question were con-
tributors to the Superannuation Fund :
Matthew Emerald Robson : Appointed tide-waiter 12th
July, 1880 ; acted as such about 16 months ; was Chinese
Inspector for three years ; subsequently was tide-waiter
for a few weeks ; was acting-looker up to Ist August,
1886; from August, 1886, to 31st March, 1893, was a per-
manent locker ; dismissed in 1893 without being- called on
to show cause ; resumed his position on tide-list; (so
apparently the department went on taking his subscrip-
tion to the fund), retired 6th August, 1896. Refused any
gratuity.
Mrs. Isabella Mason (as widow of William James
Mason): This widow was left with three young children
to support and without sufficient means to take out pro-
bate of her husband’s will ; was left a small house, subject
to some debt. Public Service Board refused any help on
the ground that she was not in necessitous circumstances;
husband had been in the public service for 27 years; his
retirement from the service had been arranged to take
effect from 31st July, 1896, but he died on 4th of the same
month.
Apparently William James Mason missed the
“ gratuity ” for which be had paid by just 27
days after 27 years’ service, and his widow had
no legal claim. Also, the Board couldn’t see
that she had any moral claim. Anyhow, Mason
ought to have known better than die at such a
time :
Herbert Cyrus Rowland Doyle : Appointed to General
Post Office by Governor in Council, 28th August, 1876; in
1896 was granted eight weeks’ statutory accumulated
leave ; entered upon that leave in July, 1896, which leave
would have expired on 2nd September, 1886 ; during cur-
rency of such leave—viz., in July—received a notification
of retirement; Mr. Doyle, who had been nearly 20 years
in the service, applied for customary leave of absence to
enable him to obtain his pension ; this was refused ; Mr.
Doyle maintains that, having been retired during the
currency of his leave, his dismissal was illegal; he has
been refused salary up to the end of his leave, though the
Minister has ordered its payment ; though refused both
pension and salary to end of leave, the 4 per cent. Super-
annuation Fund deduction was made from the last pay-
ment made him; Mr. Doyle maintains his right to a
pension.
♦ » * *
A few more cases :
Frederick Macdermott : Employed in Government
Printing Office over 21 years ; temporary hand for seven
and a half years, and a permanent officer for twelve and
a half years, vide Parliamentary Return as in previous
case; retired by Gazette notice, 31st December, 1896,
wherein he was again described as a permanent officer;
granted a gratuity of £7B as a temporary officer only;
claims a gratuity of over £2OO. (Daily signed a form
headed “ Daily check—Permanent Staff,” and in the lists
published in accordance with; section 16 of the Civil Ser-
vice Act of 1884 his name always appeared as a permanent
officer.)
Michael M'Namke : Was porter in railway service for
ten years and six months ; was transferred to post-office
as a letter-carrier; held (his position 23 years ; was re-
tired 31st July, 1896. Was offered a gratuity of 36,
which sum included his payments to the Superannuation
Fund after 33 years continuous service. Because Mr.
M'Namee was some years ago suspended for three months
and then reinstated the Public Service Board claimed his
service had been broken, and so refused him the legal
gratuity on retirement.
Edwin Rupert Pope : First appointment (temporary),
October, 1888 ; storekeeper and schoolmaster, Goulburn
gaol, June, 1889 ; appointed a permanent officer, Ist July,
1890 ; resigned voluntarily, -29th February, 1897 ; relying
on a memorandum issued by- the Public Service Board
that retirement would include voluntary' resignation. Mr.
Pope applied for a retiring-allowance and a refund of
amount paid into Superannuation Fund ; was offered the
latter, but refused any retiring-allowance.
James Jenkins : Appointed warder in Mudgee gaol, 15th
January, 1874; permanent service coihinCnced, April,
1874 ; senior warder, Mudgee gaol, November, 1887;
deputy-governor, Berrima gaol, January, 1893 ;> gaoler at
Forbes, Ist January, 1896; severely wounded while in the
public service ; retired, Ist January, 1897. Refused a
pension. Granted a gratuity as a permanent officer for
two years, and as a temporary officer for 19 years, “ in
accordance with the Board’s rule.” Mr. Jenkins claims
that the “Board’s rule” cannot override the Act, and
claims he is entitled to be granted gratuity as a permanent
officer.
Frederick Georoe Davidson Smith: Was 24 years in
the railway service ; paid nearly £IOO into the Pension
Fund ; retired on account of ill-health. Refused pension,
gratuity, and refund of superannuation‘contributions.
Frederick Atkinson : Employed in Government. Print-
ing-office as assistant-lithographer from May, 1874, to 19th
March, 1897; temporary officer, one year and three
months; permanent officer, remainder of service; in
January, 1897, his salary was reduced by £4O per annum;
three months later was discharged at two days’ notice,
after 23 vears’ service ; suffers from blood-poisoning, con-
tracted from chemicals used in carrying out his work.
Received a gratuity of £96, being at the rate'of two weeks
pay for each of the last 12 years of service ; only claims to
be entitled to gratuity as a permanent officer.
As regards M'Namee, it is claimed that he was
guilty of serious misconduct some years back.
But he was allowed to remain in the service,
and his contribution to the Superannuation
Fund seems to have been collected regularly,
and it was apparently only after all the avail-
able subscription had been got out of him that
the extreme badness of his bygone offence was
fully appreciated.
• * : • *
These are only a few cases out of a consider-
able number set forth in the report, yet the
committee alleges that a large number of other
retrenched public servants with grievances had
to be shut out for want of time to hear them.
The statements above quoted have, so far as The
Bulletin knows, received no official contra-
diction. And unless they are contradicted
very emphatically they, or some of them, con-
stitute a very disgraceful set of revelations.
Their general effect is that the New South
Wales public servant was compelled to pay a
regular premium towards his pension or retir-
ing allowance, and whether he got anything
back, or how much he got back, depended
largely on chance, or on the caprice of some-
body in office. Also they seem to imply


that the Board or the law is a great deal
more economical than it is either just or
merciful, and that either the law, or the
Board’s mode of reading the law, is business-
like to the point of brutality. Among other
things the Board holds that, if a man ranked
for many years as a “ permanent ” public ser-
vant, and paid his compulsory contributions to
the Superannuation Fund as such ; and then,
through no fault of his own, he was made a
“ temporary ” official for a month or two, and
after that resumed his “permanent” status;
that brief interlude destroyed his previous
claims on the Fund. It didn’t necessarily give
him back the money he had paid to the Fund—
it only enabled the Fund to wipe off lia-
bility to him ! Also, the Board seems to claim
that a temporary suspension, even if the person
suspended was whitewashed and remained in
the service, may be held to wipe out all pre-
vious claims. Also, it seems to claim absolute
discretion to rate anybody as a “ temporary ”
officer, even though he had been classed as
“ permanent ” for years, and paid his sub-
scription to the Fund as a permanent officer,
and was formally sacked as a “ perma-
nent ” officer, and to cut down his “gra-
tuity ” by one-half in consequence. Further,
one member of the Board stated in his
evidence that when there was a doubt
the Board always “ gave the Treasury the
benefit of it.” This certainly reads like another
way of saying that the Board always decided
against the sacked public servant when it got
the least shadow of a chance to do so. If it
always gave the Treasury the benefit of the
doubt, even though it seemed a very small
doubt on behalf of the State, and a very large
one on behalf of the retrenched official, it can’t
pretend that it even attempted to give the
latter even-handed justice.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Identification.
The case of a Sydney lady named Paton, who
sued her husband a few days ago for mainten-
ance, is a whole essay on the great art of iden-
tification. Six months ago the male Paton
disappeared, and a person very like him, or
moderately unlike him, being dragged out of
Cook’s River, Mrs. Paton identified him, after
deliberate inspection in broad daylight, as her
husband. She identified him so deliberately
that any ordinary Judge, let alone a Judge of
the old Windeyer stamp, would have hanged
anybody on her conscientious swear—especially
if she happened to he a fetching woman in a
nice bonnet. All the same, Paton turned up
again alive and dry, and who that six-months-
old cadaver may have been is now probably
beyond discovery. And this is not by any
means a solitary incident; it is the sort of thing
that happens constantly all over the world.
Only a week or two ago a defunct person who,
it is now supposed, had been Smith while in
the flesh, was found on a verandah in Colling-
wood, Melbourne. He wasn’t disfigured or
decayed ; he wore his customary clothes, and
had only been a few hours dead. And, in the
full glare of day, Patrick Costigan fully recog-
nised him as his brother Jim, and, if the
real James Costigan hadn’t turned up,
that defunct would probably have been
brother Jim to this day. A few minutes later
Henry Darby positively identified him as his
brother Patrick, and if Patrick Darby
hadn’t arrived shortly afterwards the dead man
would most likely have remained Patrick per-
manently. Then a woman identified him as
John Smith, and afterwards decided that he
wasn’t Smith. Later on he was again identified
as John Smith, and he remains at that simply
because no live Smith has arrived to dispute
his right to the name. Yet it is always possible
that the live John Smith had simply heard of
the identification in time, and decided that it
was a fair chance to leave his sordid debts and
difficulties, and a Mrs. Smith whom he couldn’t
conveniently support, and the foetid atmosphere
of Collingwood, and start life afresh somewhere
else. The simple explanation is that not one
person in ten can identify any other ordinary
person who doesn’t want to be identified.
Generally when an ordinary, every-day Smith
meets his ordinary brother Smith he knows
him, partly by his appearance, and partly by the
look of recognition which he wears in return
and the friendly blanky of his greeting. If
the man he meets doesn’t make any remark,
and doesn’t wear an aspect of recognition,
either because he is dead, or because he doesn’t
want to be recognised, or because he is the
wrong man altogether, the average Smith really
doesn’t know his own brother or his own friend
from Adam, and swears that it is him or that it
isn’t him quite promiscuously. The average
Smith may associate daily with another person
for years, and yet not be able to accurately
define his height, the color of his eyes and hair,
or any other noticeable peculiarities. He
simply knows him because when they meet they
both hail each other at the same time and
suggest having a drink. Yet when Ann
Chambers swore off-hand to the identity of
the stranger who assaulted her in the dark,
her bald, uncorroborated assertion got Suffield
(whom she had only seen—and never spoken to
at all) ten years. And when Mary Jane Hicks,
of Mount Rennie, swore cheerfully to the iden-
tity of about ten youths, whom she had only
seen once, she was fully and entirely believed.
And when anybody swears that almost anybody
was the person that he or she got a glimpse of
on a dark night, the assertion is generally quite
sufficient to base a hanging or a long spell of
penal servitude upon. Only at the resurrec-
tion, when the sea and land yield up their vast
cargo of wrongly-identified Smith, will anyone
fully understand the vastness of this subject.
4---
Boots.
The proposed combination of Sydney manu-
facturers and dealersL to put up the price of
boots 25 per cent, moved the Evening News to
make inquiry into the state of the local hoof-
case industry. It inquired in the usual way by
interviewing an optimistic person in the trade :
Mr. John Hunter, one of the largest and best-known
boot-merchants in Australia, stated that the manufacture
of colonial boots had made Rreat strides during the past
three or four years, and had about trebled. During the
same period the importation of German boots, which was
once very extensive, had decreased enormously. “ Where
we ordered £lO,OOO of Roods from Germany four years
aRO, we would not now order £lOO worth,” said Mr.
Hunter.
Then, as a commentary on the miserable in-
accuracy of the average bootmaker (or the
paper which reports the alleged bootmaker), the
State Statistician reports that £381,000 worth
of boots were imported into N.S.W. in 1896
against £356,000 worth in 1893, so that imports
in general are increasing instead of diminish-
ing. Also, although the German boot imports
have declined, despite the increase in boot im-
ports generally, they only diminished from
£22,086 worth in 1893 to £21,612 worth in
1896, so they certainly didn’t “ decrease enor-
mously.” The statement that one man’s im-
ports of German boots have declined by £9900
worth and the official fact that the total
imports of German boots only declined
by £474 worth make a very horrible dis-
crepancy. And, instead of the manufacture of
“colonial” boots having trebled in three or
four years, the local boot production in 1896,
according to the Government returns, was less
than in 1895 or 1894, almost exactly the same as
in 1893, and less than in 1891. Even the fact that
in 1896 factories employing only four hands were
reckoned in for the first time, whereby 16
places previously disregarded were counted in
and their output taken, into consideration,
couldn’t make the local boot-product for 1896
look so large as that for the previous two
years. Under these conditions, the News’s
bootmaker seems quite as unreliable as that
legendary person who imported chaff from
Colombo, and the statement that the N.S.W.
boot-output has trebled in the past three or
four years is awful rot.
The Proposed New Possils.
Owing to sundry deaths, two retirements, and
the continued absence of two members, the
strength- of N.S.W. Legislative Council is
rather lower than usual just now, and there
are persistent reports that half-a-dozen new
appointments will be made almost immediately.
If Parkes were only alive now it would be
grand to hear the old man raise his voice in
wrath about the wickedness of such a breach
of the Constitoosh’n. Reid goes to the country
in June or earlier, and the chances are just
about even that he may never come back. The
chances always are just about even in such a
case. Therefore, if Reid fills up every avail-
able seat in the Council with his own fiscal
supporters, what kind of a show has the next
man (supposing there is a next man about
August), no matter how large his Assembly
majority may be, to get his measures through
the Council? Qbviously, the only end that
could be served by filling up the Council now,
instead of leaving the matter till after the
election, is to make sure that the next Premier
won’t have a show. The nominee system lends
itself to little party dodges and wiles of this
kind, which is one good reason why it should
be abolished altogether. Moreover, if Premier
Reid means to reform the Council, this isn’t
the time to make new nominations. Allowing
for the delays of Parliamentary procedure, it
will probably be at least a year yet before the
Reform Bill, if it turns up at all, will reach the
Upper House, and, before then, any new men
who may be sent up now will probably have
lost much of their anxiety for reform. A good
tactician, who really meant business, would
make no new Council appointments whatever
until the Reform Bill is thrown out by an
indignant gang of fossils, about January, ’99.
Then he would send up enough new nominees
to carry it, and send the Bill along again, before
the new men had leisure to grow cold.
A Perjured Flossie.
In the neighborhood of Paddington (Sydney)
rifle-range there is a patch of scrub, where a
dozen or so of the unemployed habitually live,
in shelters made of old kerosene-tin and bagging.
One of them died a few nights ago of heart-
disease, and the dusty, unkempt female
who shared his aboriginal existence got
flustered, and ran hard, in her broken
boots, to report the matter to the police.
Naturally, she had to report the matter to
someone, and that part of the business was so
simple and straightforward that it seemed
almost impossible to mix it up. But her tale,
when she came to tell it, was a wild, weird
horror in sundry chapters. Three men, she
said, had committed an “outrage” upon
her the average hysterical female, if
she ran for assistance because a pic-
ture fell off the nail on to little Tommy,
would almost certainly commence her tale
with the statement that three or eighteen
or more men outraged her any time between
this morning and the year before last. Then
her protector and the three men had sailed in—
there had been battle, murder, blood, bricks,
and desperate encounters, ending with a man-
gled corpse. As a natural result three men—
the nearest three men—were arrested, and
something tremendous would probably have
happened to them if the story of the unkempt
heroine had held water. But inspection proved
that there were no boot or other marks on the
deceased ; he had simply pegged-out from heart-
disease accelerated by dwelling in a kerosene-
tin-and-bag residence and living on a precarious
diet. Therefore, he hadn’t been murdered;
also he hadn’t been battered by three men in a
fight arising out of their “ outrage ” on his dusty
and matted Flossie, and there was no evi-
dence of any outrage at all. In short, it
was only the old familiar yearning of a woman
to infuse a little romance into her sordid exist-
ence in a bag humpy, and the familiar “out-
rage ” is the only romance that kind of woman
can think of—the story that improper proposals
were made to her by a duke is beyond her
narrow imagination. Just here one would
imagine that the law would have run the lady
in for laying a false accusation, and con-
sidering her great need for a good healthy
wash, and a hair-cut, and a spell of clean
clothes and regular diet, it would have probably
been the best thing that could happen to her.
But 'the law, in Australia, never runs in the
woman who tells a lying story of “outrage,”
and tries to get three or eight or more men
hanged on the strength of it. It is an unwritten
axiom of justice that a woman may perjure her-
self on this one matter with absolute impunity,
and if the three men are not hanged they are
expected to be quite satisfied without asking
for anything more. The Australian who asks
for any thing more than not being hanged for
the thing he didn’t do, wants altogether too
much.
Commercial War.
William Lewis, to The Bulletin :
A protective tariff is essential to the prosperity of New
South Wales. The inevitable day, hastened or postponed
by circumstances, is near at hand when the people of the
province will declare unmistakably in favoi of such a
policy. When that day dawns, Protection will have come
to stay. Twenty years back in N.S.W. a Protectionist
was regarded as a dangerous crank. Expressions in favor
of such a policy were sufficient to politically ostracise any
man. To-day, without competent leaders, and lacking
journalistic representation, the adherents of Protection
have so increased in numbers that the rabid Oobdenite at
the head of the Government is only enabled to force his
Freetrade doctrines on the country with the aid of an un-
reliableand possibly treacherous Parliamentary contingent
that doesn’t believe in either Freetrade or Reid, and only
supports the latter so long as he serves its temporary
purposes. Federation would undoubtedly' bring Protec-
tion in its train —but why wait for Federation? A pro-
tective tariff established in N.S.W. as a prime result of
the near election would be a big lift to Federation. It
would be an assurance to the other provinces, all having
protective tariffs, that the powerful influence of N.S.W.
would not be exerted to remove those tariffs, but
only to harmonise them, so as to present a united and
defensive front to all foreign aggression. It would further
serve as a timely warning to the smaller and weaker pro-
vinces, indicating what they might expect in case they per-
sist in a policy of commercial and political isolation. While,
therefore, the return to power of a party pledged to a
protective policy would hasten and possibly precipitate
Federation, yet, should the latter event occur under the
present regime, it would necessarily and at once involve
commercial union between the provinces, with a general
and uniform tariff against the outside world. To discuss
the abstract question of Freetrade and Protection is
merely to parrot the gabble of the centuries. But the
issue in its local applications insists on a solution. Those
who claim that a Federation of the Australian provinces
involving interprovincial Freetrade would be a concession
to the general application of that doctrine have not con-
sidered the matter. The defences at Sydney Heads have
not been erected because of any anticipated attack from
Melbourne or Brisbane. These cities share with us the
dangers indicated by those defences, and their people
would be our natural, even though enforced, allies in any
attack on us. Likewise, the Protective tariff of Victoria,
being but the answer and defence of that province to the
aggressions of older and stronger communities on her
manufactures and commerce, was never erected as an in-
tentional barrier to interprovincial trade. That it has
operated against N.S. Wales is no more than an
unavoidable incident, arising from the political isola-
tion of each Australian province from its neighbor.
Conceding to the abstract doctrine of F’reetrade all the
resultant benefits its devotees claim for it, that doctrine
has no application to Australia or interest for Australians
solongasany government on this earth retains a Protective
tariff, any more than the Divine benison, now 19 centu-
ries old, of peace on earth, good-will to man, can have
any practical interest for the world, so long as a single
State retains its army and its arsenals. Veil it as we may
behind the polite but thin veneer of commercial inter-
course, the fact remains that the competitive strife result-
ing from trade is essentially war, and the Protective tariff
of a nation, constituting its commercial defence and
arsenal, is a blunt recognition of this fact. Suppose the
armaments of the world, military and naval, with the
single exception of that of Germany', wiped out to-morrow,
how short a time would William need to make himself
Kaiser of the Earth ? Similarly', let the nations, Germany
again excepted, throw down their tariff-walls, and that
country would shortly become one vast manufactory,
exacting tribute from the entire globe.
As the world knows, T. P. O’Connor, M.P.,
edits a smart London weekly whose policy is
firstly, secondly and thirdly, Home Rule and,
of course, anti-coercion. Q. Attorney-General
Byrnes, when in England, looked O’Connor
up —or O’Connor looked up Byrnes. Result,
a column of grease in the Weekly Sun. A
slab :
Grey-eyed, dark-complexioned, quick, witty', a born
raconteur, at the same time he has in the strong chin and
in the frank and resolute expression all the outward
marks of that stern determination of character, when the
occasion arises, of which he has given signal proof in
some perilous hours in the history of the colony. For, as
everybody knows, colonies have their troubles like older
countries, and occasionally are face to face with emer-
gencies which are the severest test of both physical and
moral courage. Mr. Byrnes, tried in one of these crises,
proved himself at once so strong in conflict and so gener-
ous in victory that he won the esteem even of opponents,
and some of the men who were most strongly opposed to
him are now his friends.
Now, the “ perilous hour ” referred to is mani-
festly the occasion on which Tomjoe forced his
celebrated Coercion Act through the Q. Legisla-
ture, and the “ emergency ” that Home Rule
Byrnes so heroically “ faced ” was the choice
between pelf and position with dishonor, and
probable temporary political eclipse with the
respect of all honest electors. As all Australia
knows, he unhesitatingly accepted the former,
and placed upon the statutes of his country the
most infamous, uncalled-for legal instrument to
be found operating outside of Ireland. For
which gallant service he is applauded by T. P.
O’Connor, Esq., Im Pay, Home Rule agitator,
anti-coercionist, and darling of the London
Radical press !
When the New South Wales Municipalities
Act was set working it was apparently not con-
templated that municipal politics would ever
be run on party lines. But with the extension
of the idea of publicly-owned works—lighting-
works, waterworks, baths, tramways, and all
the rest—the party lines have been ruled, and
that very distinctly. Now, the municipal rolls
are “ revised ” just on the eve of the elections
by the party-divided council, sitting nominally
as a court; and as under the party system the
applications for enrolment and the objections to
existing names on the roll are practically all
engineered by the two parties, and as, more-
over, the average alderman is about all that a
judge shouldn’t be, you have altogether the
foundations for a beautiful travesty of justice.
One or two pretty bad scandals have been
caused already, and there are the makings of a
great many more.
The activity of secret societies increases in
every division of Australia as general elections
draw near. In N.S. Wales they now begin to
whisper low, breathe hard, and issue furtive
signals of mysterious moment. Democracy has
no greater enemy than the secret society, and
as democracies grow strong they should charge
all such sworn- combinations as guilty of a
prime offence against free citizenship. These
perpetuate the memories of internecine con-
flicts and glorify clique rule, or attempts at rule,
by rituals of humbug. They swear to act in
concert, hut not with the sanction which law
gives to swearing, and not before the public,
and not on matters for which public approval
has been obtained. They are—to the extent
they are not ridiculous social humbugs pure
and simple—vicious would-be empires within
the Empire. Men are promoted to high
offices, military and civil, because of the
secret influence of lodges. Better men are
deprived of merited preferment because
this influence was exercised against them.
Men, ravenous for popularity, power, or pelf,
all whisper to the secret-society janitor, and
crawl into the dark place on their knees when
an opportunity for aggrandisement approaches.
Eighteen months ago, Tozer, of Queensland,
told member Leahy, in the House, that it was
advisable that the members of the Queensland
Public Service Board should belong to no
secret society whatsoever. But the prohibition
should extend further. The heads of no secret
lodge should be permitted to use any public
patronage whatever. The secret - lodgeman
should be given the alternative of giving up his
State billet, or of surrendering the secret oath
which binds him to a non-publishable exercise
of sympathy or aversion.
At the recent annual meeting of Sydney
Y.M.C.A., thus the gen. secretary :
The three things the association most needed were
more members, more funds, and a revival. During the
20 years of his secretariat, he found that the attendances
at the theatre-services had totalled IXO,OOO ; those in the
large hall, 240,000 ; the young men’s meetings of various
kinds, 151,000 ; gospel-tent services, 46,000 ; and lectures,
90,000. No less than 2,165,000 tracts and handbills had
been circulated; 53,000 young men had called at the
rooms for help and advice ; the relief-furid had provided
10,020 beds and 15,737 meals, at a cost of £1496 ; and
£16,000 had been paid in interest.
£75 a year in relief to distressed young men,
and £BOO a year in interest on mortgage for
£20,000 over a palatial building, in which to
impart spiritual consolation. The 53,000 young
men who called at the rooms for help and advice
thus got 6d. per head in the shape of beds and
meals—and a quantity of very valuable advice.
Spiritual advice evidently comes very high in
Sydney.
The objection to paying patients in Sydney
Hospital—and other hospitals—is, of course, a
medicoes’ objection chiefly ; and the medicoes
have reason. When a man can pay his doctor
he shouldn’t sponge on a charity meant for
those who can’t pay. But in practice you can’t
draw a hard-and-fast line of exclusion—can’t
say that the man who has absolutely nothing
shall come in, and the man who can pay 10s.. a
week must stand out. Then the question has a
whole lot of intricacies. For example, Dr.
Foreman said a patient who paid £2 a week
was simply robbing a doctor outside. But there
is a paid staff of doctors inside ; and the £2-
a-week man helps to support them—if there’s a
margin of profit on him he helps to sup-
port the charity. Again, the average man
who pays £2-a-week is, presumably, worth
to the community just as much as the
average man who pays nothing; and it is
to the community’s interest to cure one man
and a bit (if there’s a margin) rather than one
man and no bit. And so on—interminably.
Wherefore the conclusion that the hospitals
must just go on as they’re doing, and deal with
each case on its merits to the best of the com-
mittees’ judgment. •
A would-be Liberal Opposition party in
Queensland has just issued a so-called “ Pro-
gressive Reform League ” manifesto. Franchise
reform, exclusion of Asiatics, liberalising of
land legislation are the principal planks in the
platform. Unfortunately there is in Queens-
land, since Lilley’s death, no man whose name
inspires public confidence sufficient to re-
create a vigorous progressive party. A
mere manifesto issued by sundry mis-
cellaneous irresponsibilities is just so much
paper and nothing more. The curse of
Bananaland is that the public get so sick of the
old Liberal Griffith gang who ratted on every-
thing Liberal that the very name of Liberal
stinks in the Democratic nostrils. And vet
Queensland, as a whole, will by no means trust
the Labor-party. By the way, the latter party
is now the very loudest in clamoring for the re-
building of that Opposition the “ Socialists-i -
our-time” were so successful in squelching.
The Suffield Case.
Ballarat Courier says in leading article “ Dilig-ent
perusal and study of the evidence yield this fact clearly—
there is not a scintilla of evidence against Sutiield, except
the statement of the young woman, Ann Chambers, who
was assaulted ; not a particle. ... On the bare word of
a woman, who did not know him to speak to ; who, after
a night’s unconsciousness, said she recognised him in the
dim moonlight ; who said that he did things which only
an idiot would have done; Sutiield was sent to gaol for
the ten best years of his life. Of truth, the position in
which Suffield is to-day may be any man’s. The claim for
‘an open public enquiry ’ into his case is a claim for the
barest justice.
Editor Bulletin, —Re Suffield, it is hardly likely that
the present Parliament will vote to liberate him or grant
a new trial, owing to the Minister’s cruel indifference, and
to the lack of united effort on the part of private mem-
bers, Labor and othe^—to their shame, be it said. Sup-
posing, then, that during the elections every candidate be
asked whether, if elected, he will vote for a re-opening of
the case, if such motion is brought up in the House? In
the first place, it surely may be expected that the mem-:
ber for Suffleld’s electorate will promise to introduce the
motion—and keep his word. Secondly, nearly every
candidate will promise to support it, and I think the
majority, anyhow, will keep their word. Again, so deep
and widespread now is the popular interest in the case,
that in every constituency there are any number of men
who will be keen to exact this promise, and to watch
closely as to its subsequent fulfilment. If other means
secure an open enquiry before the dissolution, so much
the better; if not, the new Parliament will be prepared
to act immediately, armed with the best authority pos-
sible.—A. Townsend, Gilgandra, N.S.W. P.S.—lt only
needs to be known that every constituency should ask the
question of every candidate ; for the public impression is
that whether guilty or innocent this unfortunate man has
not received fair play.—A.T.
Writes “ C.” • “ Kindly send me the pamphlet on the
Suffield case. lam much interested in it, for the simple
reason that I was only the other day discharged from
Dubbo gaol after serving a sentence of two years, and,
while imprisoned, was in daily intercourse with Thos.
Suffield. I have a most thorough conviction from'
what I have seen of the man that he is innocent,
although I know nothing whatever of the case beyond
what he himself told me. We were prisoners together,
but while I was guilty of the offence I was sentenced for,
he is, I am certain, innocent of the crime imputed
to him, and I trust soon to hear of his release. Of
one thing I am certain, and that is that he will never peti-
tion or accept any remission beyond what he is entitled
to under the gaol regulations.” •• • ■
Writes Win. Horsfall, principal of the Tongan Govt.
College, from Nukualofa, Friendly Islands, Jan. 18 :
“Thomas Suffield was a schoolfellow of mine in the gram-
mar-school of the town in which I was horn. He himself
lived four miles away from the town. I knew Ins family;
and I could never have believed him guilty of the crime
with which he was so ‘ falsely ’ charged.”

A few years ago the mother-in-law joke
was considered a brilliant specimen of humor
and no comedy was quite complete without it!
Harry St. Maur—the jewelled and bangled
comedian who had David Christie Murray run in
at Geelong—was about the latest habitual ex-
ponent of the mother-in-law shriek. After his
time the dead cat of obloquy overwhelmed it
and it wasn’t resurrected in this part of the world
until the other night, when Thornton revived
Mamma at Sydney Criterion. “ Mamma ” is
the great mother-in-law groan pure and simple. It
begins with Thornton as a newly-married man •
and his wife’s mother —a dangerous female ex-
plosion who, in her early life, wore gauzy skirts
and thudded heavily in the ballet—resides
with them and keeps things in a state of
smash. The climax comes when she lands him a
strong biff on the ear, and 1 horn ton, swiping out
blindly in reply with his right, slaps his wife hard
on her beaming countenance by mistake. The
first tune “Mamma” was produced in Sydney
Lucia Harwood was the lady thus assaulted ; this
tune the painful event falls on the fair ear of
Madge Corcoran. Thornton is divorced on the
ground of cruelty, and when he marries again he
carefully selects a girl with only a father—a
flushed parent with uncertain legs. But his old
ill-luck sticks to him, for the ancient father
goes and marries. He marries Madge Cor-
coran, and brings Thornton’s old wife home
as I horn ton’s new mother-in-law, and the original
mother-in-law comes too and deposits her well-
known carpet-bag on the premises—just like old
times. In fact, the distracted little man has two
mothers-in-law instead of one, and theold familiar
blizzard of adjectives blows through the premises
with the old familiar blast. In the course of one
among many disagreements, the old lady whacks
her second son-in-law, and he also swipes blindly
at the universe, and lands Madge Corcoran on the
same ear. There is another divorce in prospect
when the curtain comes down, but the play ends
nowhere in particular. It also begins nowhere in
Particular— in fact author Grundy evidently had
alf-a-mile of mother-in-law on hand, and sawed
off 84 yards to order.
* * * *
4 Probably the most aggravating feature of
Mamma’ is the want of an ending. It is a
wretchedly unfinished play with no climax. No one
really knows for certain whether Thornton gets
rid of his mother-in-law or not; the thud of that
relative on the gravel should be heard, but it isn’t.
It doesn't appear, either, whether the second
divorce came off, or how Madge Corcoran’s second
husband got on if it didn’t; or whether that lady’s
ill-used ear fully recovered ; or, supposing she did
get a second divorce, whether she married the
third man, to whom her mother is excitedly
offering her as the curtain falls. It is generally
understood that the third man can have her
at a great reduction as a remnant that has been
slapped twice and thus depreciated, but the third
man seems doubtful. Thornton is reasonably good
in a moderate part, and George Carey gives a very
fine and artistic rendering of a brawny uncle who
laughs a huge horse-laugh in the back ground.
The cast is so uniformly good that nobody gets a
chance to look very much better than anybody
else ; but, in addition to these two, George Row-
lands and Misses Madge Corcoran and Meta Pel-
ham leave a large impression on this paper’s soul,
as people whom it would like to see again!
‘Mamma” is preceded by a rather sad and pur-
foseless one-act comedy called “ An Old Master.”
t is a modified funeral more than a comedy, but
it gives Geo. Carey and Elsie Carew a chance to
do two very clever and finished characters as an
ancient father in great grief, and a stout, breezy
lady who staggers under the name of Penelope.
To-morrow (Friday) and Saturday there
will be a brief resurrection of the “ Private Secre-
tary ’’and his immortal Bun, and then this highly-
deserving combination moves onward. This paper
hereby aims an old shoe after it for luck.

The oft-revived “ Man to Man ” is doing a
brief loud howl this week at Sydney Lyceum.
Probably it is the big railway accident, more than
anything else, which keeps this piece going.
Apart from that great and gory smash it is an
ordinary outbreak of the ordinary five-act order,
built on the regular, conventional lines. King
Hedley is arrested on his wedding-day, the stolen
wealth, which Johnston Weir carefully planted in
his pocket, being found there because Johnston
Weir tells the policeman where to look for it.
Naturally enough, King Hedley gets 14 years in a
free-and-easy gaol, where a comic murderer sings
at his work, and gives what he describes as
“ jore ” to the authorities with impunity, and
practically runs the establishment. A frenzied
desire to make sure that Johnston Weir isn’t
reading poetry to his girl makes King Hedley
break out, and the comic murderer goes with
him, and as a disguise is necessary the latter up-
sets a train in order to obtain the portmanteau of
a dead passenger. Johnston Weir and his vic-
tim's best girl are in the train, and the innocent
snd the guilty get mixed up in gory dog-fight in a
barn. Just about here, when the drama seems to
rave tied itself in a hard knot, it transpires, on
tne sole evidence of a woman of bad character
who dies of drink, that Johnston Weir and the
hero were changed in infancy. Another lady of
bad character, just out of gaol, proves conclusively
on her own bare assertion that Johnston Weir
secreted the money in King Hedley’s pocket.
People of bad character arise all over the place,
and prove, either on their own authority or on
the ground that some one who is either dead or
gone away told them about it, so many bad
things about Johnston Weir that lie is im-
mediately arrested without warrant on the
verbal order of the curate. And there-
after the show ends in the usual honorably
confused fashion. Nobody takes the trouble to do
anything for the comic murderer; and the curate,
who has a blighted love hidden beneath his coat-
tail, seems to get no special sympathy.
* • * •
A good company is more or less wasted on
this show, the railway smash overshadowing them
to a great extent. It is a noble smash, and several
hundred people seem to be struggling over the
blazing ruins, dragging insensible girls from under-
neath the wreck, and calling on God for assistance.
Frank Harcourt’s comic murderer is the most in-
teresting character in the human part of the
entertainment. He is a fine, realistic mur-
derer. Any dog catching sight of Harcourt
would immediately scorch in a bee-line over
three parishes, and if eight policemen met him
they would at once whistle for further assistance.
King Iledley, Harry Shine, and Walner Gregory
a gentleman who has the honor to be Mr. Eliza-
beth Watson in private life deserve honorable
mention ; and the same remark is made, only in a
mitigated form, about Johnston Weir. Miss Lilian
Wheeler is the trustful heroine of the drama —the
clinging girl who faces calamity with her back-hair
coming down and a noble trust in Providence;
and, considering Miss Wheeler’s many attractions,
it is a pity that the good girl in real life should, as
a rule, have no hair to come down worth mention-
ing. Somehow in this unpoetical world a noble
character and a very skimpy back knob generally
go together. This reflection disheartens Thk
Bulletin so much that it passes Misses William-
son and Ethel Grey with the bald remark that
they fill two rather absurd parts better than the
parts deserve, and that a lot of scenery bears a
hand at intervals.

The “French Maid” will bo revived at
Her Majesty s for a few nights, commencing on
Saturday. Ihe “Maid,” in the present writer’s
opinion, comes a good way behind the co.’s other
production, the “Gay Parisienne,” in the matter
of fuss and feathers and melody and humor, and
a quarter-yard of unexpected stocking. Still
Sydney in general took it in a friendly spirit on
its previous appearance. Pretty Ada Reeve will
be Suzette on this occasion. Bert Gilbert is to be
Jack Brown, and if his pantomime Uncle isn’t a
solitary effort the new Brown ought to be a very
light Brown indeed. May Pollard makes a first
appearance as Dorothy, and the rest of the co.
including the wildly-versatile Albert Whelan,’
will be mostly as before.

The Ilegelmanns, whose recent appear-
ance in Melbourne was so surprising that this
paper went out in great haste and had its drink
analysed to see if that had anything to do with it
are now doing their astonishing feats at Sydney
livoli. The incomprehensible thing about the
Hegelmanns is that they do the most surprisin' s,
flying trapeze acts without the trapeze. When
the average serial contortionist flies off a swinging
trapeze, and stands twice on his head in the air
and then gets on to another trapeze 20 yards
ahead, lie stands a fair chance of breaking his neck
still, as the trapeze gives him a vigorous send-off’
it is possible to understand how he gets there.’
But a perfectly harmless-looking Hegelmann will
do the same thing without any start, and not turn
a hair. He simply hangs from a fixed bar, and, if
he lets go, it is quite obvious that he must drop
and become a very unpleasant Hegelmann down
on the floor, or somewhere. Then he does let go
and, for no visible reason, he whizzes straight
ahead through the air for a long distance
turning- over as he goes, and lands safely. How
he does it no one knows, but, when the Hegel-
manns describe themselves as the Greatest
Aerial Gymnasts in the World, this paper, anyhow
IBn t going to contradict them. Any greater
aerial gymnast will have to dispense with the bar
altogether, and hang on with both hands to the
east wind.

An overwhelming first-night audience
which arrived earlier and stayed later than usual’
gave promise of a healthy future for Rickards’’
pantomime at Melb. Opera House—the panto,
that originally shook its various legs at Sydney
Royal. “Jack the Giant Killer” is an unstable
work of Xmas fiction bound in elegant calf, and
illustrated by a strong staff of artists. There are
so many clever artists that they get in one
another's way, and become hopelessly entangled
at the finish. Each performer seems to °get
through his or her allotment of narrative very
early in the proceedings, and thenceforth they
all go-as-they-please, with a laudable ambition to
distinguish themselves. This is probably the best-
danced panto, on Melbourne record. Also, the
dressing, mounting, and musical clowning are
first-class features, and the general effect upon the
publie mind is a sense of good value for cash.
Rickards gives a costly show at popular prices
lie might have produced an equally useful article
at less expense, but bis customers are glad to think
that he didn't. Human nature always wants the
best of the deal.
* * * •
Addie Conyers and Lottie Moore are prin-
cipal figures in the sentimental section of the
business, and they sing a sweet duet that deserves
a lot more notice than it received on Saturday
night. George Lauri, the Haytors, Tom Woot-
well, Albert Bellman, and Marietta Nash beino-
crowded together in the centre of the “comic”
department, it goes without saying that one or
other of them is more or less amusing at any given
period, and sometimes they are all funny together.
Whatever they do is done quickly, anyway.
Story Gofton, as the giant, is the only unrapid
comedian on the job, but he makes a highly
probable giant, and the action cf the panto,
revolves aiound his legs in a cheerful manner. As
a member of the co., the Giant commands con-
siderable praise, and as a piece of scenery he
approaches very near to perfection. The Huline
Bros., the Tiller quartette of festive girl-dancers,
likewise the full ballet, and the incidental plitter
leave nothing to be desired, as they say in the
daily papers. “Jack the Giant-killer” is a large
variety-show, supported by much gorgeousness ;
furthermore it is a pantomime suitable for the
young, and starts at a favoiable moment.
** # *
“Dick Whittington,” at the Royal, will
not invite comparison after Friday. “ Dick ” has
been a hardworking panto., and Melbourne doesn’t
seem to be deserting it in its last nights. On
Saturday the management will pay off the mob of
youthful auxiliaries, and stage “The Shaugh-
raun,” with Grattan Riggs in the name-part once
again. The Bulletin reckons that Riggs is at
least a reasonable excuse for an Irish-drama revi-
val, on account of his old-established brogue.
** * *
The first week of “ Ben-My-Chree,” at
Melb. Princess’s, was not so much affected by the
weather as some of the other shows, and unless
another monsoonal depression has overtaken
Wilson Barrett he is no doubt groaning in the
wilderness to large audiences. By the way, some-
body has been tracing a connection between Wil-
son Barrett and the recent developments of Vic-
torian climate. His first four dramatic characters
in this country have certainly tended to en-
courage monsoonal depression. As Claudian he
endured 100 years of Holy Clement’s curse; as
the Manxman he suffered horribly through another
fellows breakage of a solemn oath ; as Virginius
he murdered his child to save her from something
that was said to be worse than death ; as the hero
of “ Ben-my-Chree ” this sorrow-stricken tragedian
is twice cut off from humanity, by order of a
Bishop on the first occasion, and secondly by
the hangman s hand. A Roman earthquake
and a thunderstorm at the Isle of Man have
eventuated from Wilson Barrett’s hard luck
in two of the plays aforesaid, and it is
quite time for Wragge to protest against
an actor who excites the fury of the elements
wherever he goes. But no mattah ! “Ben-my-
Chree, as The Bulletin remarked last week, is a
series of stage thrills, arranged on the best theatri-
cal principles. It needs more than one actor to
woik a thrill as a rule, and JVIr. !Barrett gets valu-
a tie assistance in the principal scenes from Carter
iiidwards (the Bishop), Ambrose Manning (fisher-
rmin Davy), Wigney Percival (the Governor), and
Edward Irwin (Cousin Ewan). D. McCarthy, as
ti e Deemster, is not, perhaps, as impressive as he
wishes to appear, but if the Deemster in question
was a lineal descendant of Guy Fawkes the per-
formance of McCarthy is possibly lifelike.
#* * *
On Saturday the Princess’s programme
will be Silver King,” with Wilson Barrett in his
original part. “ Silver King ”is still good fora
run m Melbourne under the most ordinary cir-
cumstances, and considering that Wilson Barrett’s
revival of the first Wilfred Denver is not an
ordinary circumstance the play ought to boom.
** * *
“Infanticide,” at the Alexandra, is a five-
act joke of a bloodthirsty nature derived from one
or more previous atrocities whose names don’t
appear on the bill. Dan Barry’s latest appeal to
the masses fetched a big attendance, as times go,
on Saturday, and Daniel expressed his satisfaction
by throwing a virtuous convict into a burning
fiery furnace, whilst he (Dan) awaited the coming
of a semi-circular saw towards an infant he had
placed upon the fatal plank. The saw was making
w r u-’> eC i b i e \'° W , of cl:ttln k its way to little

attempt to recover its ancient prestige on Satur-
day, the 19th, when the pretty little house re-

Daily newspaper criticism is sometimes quite truthful
in retrospect. For instance, Melb. Age, noticing Wilson
Barrett s performance of “Virginius,” observed that it
brought out certain Qualities in the actor “which the
artificiality and fantasy of * Claudian ’ obscured.”
She was a subordinate fairy in the ballet at So-and-so’s
pantomime, a fairy of dimensions, an I one night she
slipped off her little pedestal, and fell upon a lusty super.
That super, has been in hospital with some fractured ribs
for the last two weeks. It is well to have those about you
who are fat and sleep o’ nights, but the principle should
not be carried too far in selecting fairies.
. “Clara Butt, the contralto, shows the benefits of her

London correspondent, “and at the Royal Amateur Or-
chestral Society’s smoking concert put in a thrilling claim
to be considered one of the three finest songstresses in
England. Six feet of large-framed, 26-year-old woman- f.
hood, with a mass of blue-black hair draped and dressed,
after the latest Parisian ear-hiding mode. Her face
and voice are full of life and intensity of expres-
sion, and the clear, round enunciation of her basement
notes would rouse the corpses in a cemetery. With the
glacial fog outside, she sang ‘Oh ! for a day of Spring’
(Stern), ‘ a day of flower and folly . . . of strength and
passion ... of love in all its wavs,’with a dessert of
death to follow, and with such v br tory feeling as to grip
Wales’ royal ear—as the spent barn ■ flickered up—and
fix him in his saddle-back seat with his unsmoked cigar
poised like a lance.”
liaresfoot: “ A Melb. paper photo’s. Hennings at work

cess’s, and made a striking hit, or splash, with his brush
in a piece called ‘ A Romantic Idea.’ The first conspicu-
ous scenic-artist in Melb. was William Pitt, imported by
Coppin from the London Lyceum, where he had a hand in
Madame Vesti is’s productions. After painting a gorgeous
transformation for the first, Melb. Royal ‘ Whittington ’
he soon retired before the lustre of Henning's. Pitt
became a publican at the Garrick's Head, Bourke-street.
His son is William Pitt, the Legislative Council member.”
With reference (writes The Bulletin’s London corre-
spondent) to a statement in Bulletin of Nov. 20 that
“ Mrs. Potter and Mr. Bellevv live in a charming house” :
the matter is one which little concerns anybody but
the parties themselves, but it may be as well to mention
that, though the lady and her artist-comrade are domi-
ciled in the same thoroughfare-Abbey-road - their roof-
trees are some distance apart. The Potter-Bellew
“ Charlotte Cord ay,” at the Islington Grand, was such a
success that Whitehall Review says: “Islington has
been given a first-night which should have been found at
the West End,” and adds that “No praise can be too
great for the Marat of Mr. Bellevv, which should once for
all kill the unkind opinion that this artist is in love with
himself. A physically hideous villain; a wreck of
humanity undermined b.v crime and vice.” The Daily
Tkleokai'h also, while commending highly Mrs. Potter’s
Charlotte, considers Marat “the best tiling Mr. Bellevv
has yet done, and a treat to all admirers of strong and
honest acting.” The piece would have been produced at
the Adelphi but for a dislocation of arrangements due to
the Terriss tragedy.
The British Museum possesses a tablet with a very
ancient Latin inscription—probably the oldest “ standing
room only” notice extant. Some forgotten Goodman
used to hang it outside the hippodrome, and it hears the
legend : “ Great shouting; house full; doors closed.”

The January revenue of N.S.W. (£670,535) was
£5871 better than that for January’, 1897. For the seven
months of the financial year that are gone, the decrease,
as compared with the same seven months of previous year,
is £195,456. The deficit, so far, is £424,563, which is
£106,000 bigger than the deficit which existed at the end
of January, 1897. And the loan-money expended for the
months ended 31st January, 189 S (£981,437), is
£148,738 more than the loan-money’ expended for the cor-
responding seven months of last financial year. So the
situation boils down to these three propositions : Revenue
dwindling rapidly ; deficit getting bigger; debt increasing
faster. Considering the deficit and the fact that more
than half the loan-money goes in non-productive works
which should be charged against the year’s income, the
above figures bring us back to the old result that N.S.W.
needs to raise another 11 or 2 millions revenue per annum
to pay its way honestly. In other words, it needs the
present land and income taxes and a heavy tariff as well,
and, till it gets these things, its finances will never be any-
thing better than the lie and swindle they are now.
* * * *
The Victorian revenue for January (<£587,109)
shows an improvement of £B5ll on the figures for Janu-
ary, 1897, and, for the seven months that are gone of the
financial year, the takings (£3,961,452) are an increase of
£158,414 upon those for the corresponding seven months
of last year.
* * » •
Queensland’s revenue for January is .£12,000
larger than that for January, 1897. For the seven months
to 31st January the State income (f 2,270,000) is >lOOO
better than for the same period last y’ear, so the big fal-
ling-off of a few months ago has been made good. And,
so far, revenue is £262,000 ahead of expenditure (the
Treasury news from Brisbane generally’ comes along
in. round figures and damns the odd coppers), so, if
things keep on as they are going, the most tired Premier
in Australasia should have a decent paper surplus at the
end of the y’ear. But Nelson’s surpluses, like those of
George Reid, mostly arise through charging everything to
loan funds which can be put there without aggravating
the most tired community in these parts beyond all en-
durance.

Acting-Premier Wittenoom, of Westralia, states
that he is well satisfied with the results of the last loan
(£1,009,000 of 3 per cent, stock realised about £947,500 —
loss ; 52,500), and that, when the Boom Land puts its
next loan on the market, a few months hence, there is
every’reason to believe it will also go off well. They’are
going it strong in Forrestralia. Last month’s loan added
£6 per inhabitant to the public debt in one act, and
already they are talking about the “next loan.” The
great water scheme, whereby’ Coolgardie is to be supplied
with drinking fluid, carried 200 miles or so through 90,000
ton weight of pipes, at a cost of £2,500,000, is really
getting under way’ at last. How it will pay is a my’sterv ;
also, it is an open question if the pipes are big enough for
the purpose ; and how much it will cost annually to keep
that 10-days’ journey of pipage in repair when it begins to
go is a very large problem indeed.

The Canadian Dominion’s 3 per cent, stock was
worth £lO7 in London last month. The 3 per cents, of
Quebec, which has the biggest revenue of all the Canadian
provinces, were worth £95. That means that the Federa-
tion can borrow at £2 16s. per cent., and the richest pro-
vince at £3 3s. percent.—difference between Provincialism
and Federation, 7s. per cent. If the five Australian pro-
vinces which are now tearing each other’s hair in a
brotherly convention would agree to pool all their debts,
the saving on the above basis through improved
credit alone would be £560,000 a year when the
stock is finally’ converted, and that would form a
sinking-fund which would pay off every penny of the
existing debts in something less than a century. There
would also be a saving through having only one stock
and one system of management instead of five, but even
apart from this £560,000 a year is a lot to throw over-
board from sheer jealousy and brotherly cussedness.

A gentleman connected with the A.J.S. Bank
takes exception to some of The Bulletin’s recent com-
ments on that institution. The report stated that the
difference (£55,231) between last half-year’s profits and
previous half-year’s loss represented the difference
between the old 4£ per cent, interest and the new 3 per
cent, rate, and this paper alleged that the said difference
didn’t nearly account for it. It is now informed that the
reduction in interest accounts for only £45,000 out of the
above £55,231, so it reckons that its statement was quite
correct. It also suggested that the balance of the saving
probably'iarose through economy in working expenses, or
through the management taking a more sanguine view of
the securities. It is informed that it arose solely through
economy, and not through any more sanguine view
of the securities, and it doesn’t mind accepting the
assurance in full; at the same time, if the A.J.S.
balance-sheet showed what the working expenses
amounted to each half-year it would be valuable corrobor-
ation. Further, this paper pointed out that the old
assets Still stood at the “ old valuation ” ; that apparently,
judging by the fact that the profits were only 6s. per cent,
per annum on nominal capital, there were heavy losses to
be provided for, and much lost capital to be written-off,
and that so far there had been no writing-down of capital,
and no suggestion of any. The Bulletin’s informant re-
ports, in an informal sort of way, that, when the new valua-
tion now in progress is completed, the paper value of the
assets will be readjusted. Still, the fai t remains that
nothing has been said officially about writing-down capi-
tal ; and that this is a very late hour to keep the old
values still standing in the balance-sheet. What the
chairman said was that the values presented to the
British depositors at the second reconstruction were pre-
pared at a time of extreme depression, and were—
by implication—too low ; also, that a careful review
of that panic-estimate was in progress. What
The Bulletin desires to say is that the other values
which appear in the balance-sheet were apparently con-
structed in the boom-time and are probably too' high
—which is an entirely different thing. Also, though the
chairman said that a review of the aforesaid low estimate
was in progress he didn’t say—so far as the report shows
—that when it was finished the values in the balance-
sheet would be adjusted accordingly, and the capital
written down, if necessary, to correspond. And it seems
to this paper that some such remark as that was much
needed.

Themain features of a rather low-spirited interim
report issued by the Victoria Insurance Co. (Melbourne)
are to the effect that the big Melbourne fire cost the co.
between £30,000 and £40,000, and that, in place of the
credit balance of £10,174, there is no%v a debit of £15,888.
There is no dividend, and, with this large defunct horse
to work off, there isn’t likely to be one for another year or
more. The wholly remarkable feature of the case,
however, is this statement which the chairman is alleged
to have made to the meeting : “Through the conservative
action of the co. in putting aside money to meet disasters
of this kind, they would be able to pay these heavy losses
without making calls on the shareholders.” He seems
to regard it as a quite surprising virtue that this big co.
didn’t come to grief over its first serious loss. The Bulle-
tin’s complaint, on the other hand, is that the Victoria
directors haven’t put away money’ to any extent worth
speaking of, and that, in the matter of huge dividends,
they’ have been about the most reckless and least far-
seeing set of spendthrifts that could be imagined. And it
offers the following figures from the Victoria’s recent
balance-sheets as evidence :
Profit. Dividend.
1392 .. £22,158 .. 40( per cent = £29,221
1893 ... 34,034 .. 44} „ = 22,468
1894 ... 24,400 .. 44} * „ = 22,468
1895 ... 20,741 .. 40} „ = 20,221
1896 ... 17.058 .. 35} „ = 17.974
1897 .. 18,010 .. 35} „ = 17,974
On paper, therefore, the Victoria saved £15,125
in six years. But during that period the annual return
from investments dropped from £6127 to £3705, showing
a very serious depreciation of the assets, for which no suffi-
cient provision was marie. In 1897 the directors at last ac-
knowledged in effect that the contingency fund of £20,000
was insufficient by transferring £5OOO to it from reserve.
They didn’t writeoff the inflated values, but left them stand-
ing with the contingency fund against them, but there is
every reason to suppose, from the interest returns, that
the £25,000 provided will all be required. Therefore, it
would seem that the co., which was apparently worth
about £113,600 net in 1893, is now only worth about
£79,500 net. Huge dividends and neglect to pro-
vide for depreciation out of profits are the visible
causes. The Victoria has made no addition to
its reserve for a very long time, and its miser-
able £50,000 —now reduced to £45,000 with a heavy debt
against it—is utterly inadequate. And the co. which
pay’s 35} per cent, dividend in a year, when it has actually
to trench upon its reserve, takes almost the biggest bun
on earth for recklessness. Under anything like prudent
management the Victoria would have aimed at build-
ing up a reserve of four or five times the existing
amount. The best thing it can do now is to write
down its securities to their real value, and when the pre-
sent loss is made good and dividends are resumed, to keep
the divs. down to one-half the profits for the next 20
years and invest its new reserve in State securities, so
that it won’t slump so dreadfully as the old reserve seems
to have done. Even at this rate it should yield from 15 to
20 per cent, to shareholders, and the shareholder who
grumbles at that must be a very violent whale for profits.

The Australian Gaslight Co. (Sydney) has a
profit this half-year of £54,743, which is about its average
for the second half of the year. The usual 15 per cent,
dividend (£51,135) is paid, and the remainder, with pre-
vious balance, leaves £6637 to carry forward. This big
sound monopoly’ has about £682,000 capital and £llO,OOO
reserve, and it makes no attempt now to pile up extra
wealth—in fact, its profit balance is about £llOO less than
it was five years ago.

That very sad little concern, the Watson’s Bay
Ferry Co., whose green-painted boats puff and groan
along the South shore of Sydney Harbor, reckons it made
during 1897 a clear profit of £34 —equal to about one
speck in the £. And even with this, the accumulated
loss stands at £5247. Sydney C.vclorama co., by way of
being about equally’ cheerful, reports a half-year’s profit
of £33.

cent, mark, and brought its profit and loss balance down
to £33. This time it pays 5 per cent, (£2500), and the
small balance, added to the above £33, leaves it with
£127 on hand. Capital, £lOO,OOO ; reserve fund (in case
of something dreadful happening) about £5OO.

Evidence of the new Sydney City Treasurer as
to how they used to keep valuable securities at Sydney
Town Hall:—“ When I first came to the Town Hall I
found debentures in his safe, whereupon I expressed sur-
prise to the town clerk that there should be £30,000 worth
of bearer bonds, negotiable on demand, entrusted to my
custody, and Mr. Daniels said that was the usual thing.
They were rolled up in bundles with a piece of elastic
round them—there were three or four lots, I think—and
they were lying in a corner of the safe. I straightened
them out by putting them between pieces of millboard,
but although the.y are better they are not straight now.”
The late town clerk on the same subject:—“ He had no
knowledge of the debentures coming out of the bank. He
had imagined that they were in the bank, but he did not
satisfy’ himself that they were there because the question
never arose. The debentures were not supposed to be in
his custody. He never had anything to do with them.
They were in the custody of the treasurer or the bank
when he took office. He did not know for what length of
time the late treasurer had them in his possession. He
thought the late treasurer got them out of the bank for
the purposes of the audit. After the audit they were left
in the safe instead of being returned to the bank. They
were returned to the bank by direction of the late Mayor.
The debentures amounted to £29,700. They were never
handed over to him at any time. He knew nothing about
any debentures when he took office.” But even this is
better than the way that the average country and subur-
ban municipalities do things. They generally leave the
valuable securities, if there are any, either on the mantel-
piece or in the fowl-house.

Looking forward to the probable suspension of
the Colonial Sugar Co’s works on the Northern (N.S.W.)
rivers, a Hindoo agency is vigorously engaged raising
capital and providing labor for the resumption of cane-
growing on a purely cheap-nigger basis.
“ Klondyke agencies ” are beginning to spring
up in Australia. Their main features are that the
management professes to know all about the place, and
undertakes to land the prospector there at a very moder-
ate rate. Tub Bulletin knows nothing definite about
these agencies beyond this —that when the party gets to
San Francisco or Vancouver, the tickets which are to
carry it the rest of the way may be good, or they
may be only waste paper and of no account. And
if they are waste paper—well, the chances are that the
party has no money with which to pay its fare back with
a view to wallopping the agent to death. And if it did
get back the agent might be gone by that time. Any-
how, when the present scribe goes to Klondyke he won’t
take any risks on this head. The snow and the Klondyke
whisky and the Klondyke poker-sharp are risks enough
without taking any more.

Latest innovation on ad valorem importations
into protected ports. Take bent-wood furniture, for in-

charges his consignee £2 10s. a dozen for packing and
cases, which charges have, according to regulation, to be
allowed off the ad valorem to the importer. The rest is
easy between shipper and importer.

B.H. Proprietary directors, if rocky in English
composition, get there all the same with the divs. This
last half-year— to Nov. 30—the net profit was £111,128 ;
but, as the co’s financial position was unusually strong,
the usual £144.000, as the world knows, was paid in divs.
The actual profit on the operations for the half-year was
£146,000 or so ; but, as the co. doesn't charge itself with
the cost of machinery’ as plants are erected, it has to
write off from actual cash for depreciation. In other
words, it charges itself with the cost of plant as the
plant gets worn out or useless, instead of when it is put
up, at which time it is supposed to be as good as the gold
it cost. The net profit is big or little, therefore, as much
or little is written off for depreciation.

An explanation of things at the Cobar Gold-
mines, N.S.W., conies from London in the chairman’s re-
marks to shareholders. Boss O’Gorman was appointed
after the fullest inquiry’ as to ability. His first report of
the mine endorsed those of Callahan, Irwin, Janin, and
others, on the strength of which the mine was bought.
They all advised cyaniding, Janin dry-crushing as well as
cyaniding. O’Gorman declared, times bey ond number,
that cyanide was unnecessary, that the gold was free-
milling, and his tailings would be too poor for subsequent
treatment. Knowing the low-grade nature of the mine, a
100-head “ modern American stamp-mill ” was ordered,
and over £7OOO spent on a dam to keep it running, Some
£lO,OOO was spent in opening the mine. This ex-
hausted the working-capital. The extraction from 12,000
tons was 33 per cent. only’. O’Gorman now advises the
immediate erection of a cy’anide-plant, and has gone to
London to explain things. When he will comeback is un-
certain. Instead of doing the best milling in Cobar, he
did the worst. Tailings are being carted to the little
cyanide-plant with which the vendors not only proved the
value of the mine by’ treating many thousands of tons of
ore and tailings, but also established the method of treat-
ment, which was afterwards set at defiance ; and it will
now cost £6OOO to set the mistake right.

Another reconstruction of the Lake George
Mines, N.S.W., by the issue of 50,000 new shares at £l,
first offered to the present holders, but it is announced
that an important group has offered to take at par all not
accepted. This is by far the lowest-grade working copper
and silver mine in Australasia. Shares have been falling
steadily for two months. “Sulphur” writes: “Recent
returns from 6373 tons show a copper equivalent of 113
tons, or an extraction of 1.78 p.c. Fully 56 tons of ore to
turn out one ton of—nay, not copper, but the equivalent
mixed through about 4 tons of matte, to be again smelted
with heavy’ charges on it, and the few ounces of gold and
silver through the matte to again suffer loss in smelting.
It seems like putting an elephant to pick up pins.
Can no better method be found ? Time some alteration
was made, or tried.”

The prospectus of the Mutual Financial and
Mining Development Co. (Melb.) is something to read,
mark, and inwardly digest. “ The objects of the com-
pany are for the purpose of developing mining or other
industries,” and 80,000 shares of ss. each are offered to the
public. Also “it is anticipated that when the first 10,000
shares are allotted some business now under consideration
will (if accepted) place the company in a position to war-
rant its success.” The prospectus doesn’t suggest any
reason why the mysterious business aforesaid shouldn't
be accepted, and considering that it is the only business
which the promoters appear to have “ considered ” the
chances are very much in favor of them accepting it with
enthusiasm if they ever achieve the sale of 10,000 shares.
As an acknowledgment of their enterprise and energy in
floating the co. (if floated) the promoters will be prepared
to accept 20,000 shares free of charge.

proached the co verbally on a basis equivalent to

Australian United mine, Bummer’s Creek,
W.A. : 302 tons for 6580 z. “ This is the mine, a large
interest in which Lord Fingall bought out of the profits
of the Londonderry flotation, and presented to the Lon-
donderry co.” By some arrangement, the original owners
of the Plunderderry don’t participate in the benefits of
this present—nor are their shares quoted on London Stock
Exchange. The result is that, while ordinary shares are
saleable at from ss. to 65., the vendors can’t get even 2s.

as far off as ever.

Australian mine, Coolgardie, owned by a French

No doubt the winze is being sunk in the very richest part
of the chute, which can’t be very long or the Q.M. would
be a much bigger mine. It is anyhow one of the very few
consistent producers of the province outside of Hannan’s,
and after many divs. shares are one-third the price they
were before the mine paid any. Cold iron to chew !

Stated that the mighty Kaufman has rejoined
the London Globe and Finance Corporation—the organisa-
tion worked in London by Whitaker Wright, manipulated
by Herbert Trower, and presided over by Dufferin. This,
too, after publication, under the signature of the secre-
tary, that Kaufman had left because the terms of the
agreement under which he was engaged had expired,
cruelly adding that the directors hail no intention of
renewing the engagement, and after Horatio Bottomley
had announced in a speech, remarkable only for its
sickening eulogy of said Kaufman, that his invaluable ser-
vices had been secured by the W.A. Mines Trust Co. A
week ago, the mining-market men of Adelaide were
staggering under the attempt to unravel the effect of
Kaufman’s action. Lane and Brookman have their
places, but Kaufman’s is right at the top. Some say,
recognising that the boom was over, and the harvest
therefrom ended, Kaufman wanted to join the market-
operations in London and shake off the dust of Kalgoorlie.
That, too, is said to be Lane’s ambition. How much nicer
it must be to live in London with lots of money than in
Westralian camps with no boom 1 The writer can hardly
imagine Kaufman, with his 10,000 Lake Views, for services
rendered, and his pot of solid cash, returning to Kal-
goorlie, which isn’t much of a place for an epicure, any-
how. Paree ! Louee ! Vhiskee !

Callahan, boss of the Lake View mine, Wes-
tralia, is right in declaring that the principle of allowing
a dual title to exist for the same piece of auriferous ground
is an absurdity. It may cause a big riot in that country—
there are strong indications of a great row as we write.
But, having well-established that principle throughout,
W.A., Govt, now rushes in with a regulation limiting allu-
vial mining on leases to within 10ft. of the surface. “The
Chambers of Mines and the mining managers applaud the
action of the Govt., and sympathise with the Minister for
Mines on account of all the abuse heaped on him.” How
much sympathy and applause would he get from them if
it were proposed to limit reef-mining even to 1000 ft. ?
The Minister has since explained to a deputation that the
regulation is in no way retrospective, so that any man
who had pegged ground before it was gazetted can sink as
deep as he likes. The backing-down of the Govt, on this
depends on the area pegged. If it is largely on Bull’s
leases, some means of shifting the digger will soon be
looked for. The water-supply hangs on Bull finding a
lot more money, and, as another boom can’t be found
without him, the Govt, is his creature. On the authority
of the press, VVestralia is weeping for the return of Forrest.

The balance-sheets of the Lake View South and
Lake View Extended mines contain interesting items, con-
sidering that neither has reached a producing stage
worth mentioning. In the first the special fee and
travelling exs. of VV. G. Brookman amount to £553 2s. Cd.
and in the second £557 2s. 6d. Both items are said to be
subject to adjustment. The L.V.S. still owes the Associa-
ted Gold Mines £lO,OOO as purchase money, also £7253f0r
disbursements made by them on behalf of this co. but
subject to this eo.’s claim in connection with milling and
machinery. Italsoowes the L.V.E. £2001). The manage-
ment exs. in Loudon and Adelaide were more than was paid
in wages on the mine. Against all liabilities the co. has
about £SiXM) in hand. The last crushing went only a few
dwts. to the ton, and unless the mine soon gets on to
better ore, the co. will have to face reconstruction. No
wonder the shares have slumped from 50s. to 30s. In the
L.V.E. too it costs more to run the management than the
mine. It is in a better position. “To sundry debtors,
£7145 15s. 3d.” “On deposit against securities, £13,000.
Cash in hand £4025 10s 3d.” But, against this “To
vendors, balance of purchase money, £12.500.” A glance
at the extraordinary items of these sheets is enough to
prove that it takes more to manage these two non-pro-
ducers in Westralia than a dozen of the biggest Vic.
div.-payers all dumped together.

It is still hoped to form a Westralian timber-

Jarrah Timber Co., with a capital of £250,000 and

Edwards is among the directors ; ditto some Boulder and
other mining men. Pretty plainly, American softwood
will have a hard struggle to get such a place in the Wes-

charging for the jarrah at mineral rates on the province’s
railways is a vast help.

There was great joy in Cosm6, and intense expectation
was the order of the day when news came from Billy Lane
that a batch of young women ready and anxious to wed
were on their way to the settlement. The excitement
was at fever-heat when said girls arrived. A social was
given in their honor that very night; and so exceeding
great was the joy that thrilled the breasts of the bache-
lors, that they decided to jubilate some more; and so
another social was held the following night. Hope
swelled high neath the rags of various Cosmeites who
yearned for the delights of matrimony that had long been
denied them. The discontent that various repasts of
monkey roast and monkey haricot had awakened, had
given way to stranger feelings than monkey in an.y shape
could possibly arouse, and, on the third night, yet
another meeting was held. This time men only were
bidden. Conjecture ran wild. The meeting was surely
called in order to squelch riotous proceedings, and settle
matters re the courtship of the three girls, as three
females couldn’t possibly be wives to all the single men
who longed for such luxury. But, no ! such wasn’t the
case at all. The meeting was held for the sole purpose of
enquiring into the conduct of the girls on the'voyage out;
and the latest is that two of the braw Scotch lassies were
expelled straight away ; the other, being only 15 years
old, was kept until her people were communicated with.
The funniest part of it all is the fact that every applicant
desirous of joining Cosm6 is subject to inspection by
Billy Lane himself. Perhaps, dear Bulletin, these girls
were of the “ large-hipped, full-breasted ” type about
which Billy used to write and rave so much ; evidently
not the sort, though, for the “ tall, straight Westerners.”

Mr. Justice A. H. Simpson’s conduct of
N.S.W. divorce business in Chambers during
vacation has been a godsend to those unfor-
tunates who, having been ordered to contribute
moneys for their wives’ costs or alimony, were un-
able to pay. His honor dealt with several motions
for attachment of husbands who had not obeyed
these orders because they could not. One counsel,
in applying for a commitment, remarked, “ This
application is merely a formal matter, y’r honor.”
“ I don’t, think so,” retorted the Judge; “ I don’t
think it is a formal matter to send a man to prison ”
—and he went on to point out that the power to

The historic man who was immured in a
, r , i , ,
dungeon for 2o years, when it suddenly occurred
to him to open the door and walk out, didn’t flock
quite separately. In a Melb. detective office last
week two young men, who had already got 12
months hard for burglary, were awaiting trial
on another charg .. I uibably they grew tired of
waiting, for they slipped off the misfit handcuffs,
jumped through the open window of the office,
and bolted. There was a considerable drop from
the window, but two stout girls passing below
came in handy to fall upon, and the burglars were
rnr i ,
uninjured. Ihe results to the girls are not
explained. One house-breaker was caught, but
his pal got safely away.

Dear Bulletin, —You see some
queer things at times. For instance,
one of the houses in a large terrace
opposite our backyard is occupied by
a rather important personage and his
wife—people whose names figure prom-
inently at Government House recep-
tions, and other social functions. One
peculiar habit of this couple is to
dress and undress at a large open
window at the back of the
house. The neighbor may be
in his backyard after tea, en-
joying a breath of fresh air, or
innocently sniffing his gerani-
ums, when he will be suddenly
s artled by the crash of a
casement thrown open. Look-
ing up, he will see a fat
gentleman at the window
with—well, hardly a rag of
clothing on. Then the f.g’s
wife will appear at intervals
in the same condition ! They
are solemnly dressing for din-
ner. This performance occurs
daily. Now, anyone who has
not seen the pair may be in-
clined to think they desire to pose
publicly as Yenus and Adonis.
Alas ! one look is sufficient—the
man is of a podgy, tublike figure ; and
the lady ! —her apparent scragginess,
even from a distance, is truly awful.
This same pair, having no children,
keep as substitutes a large assortment
of dogs, kennelled in a small paddock,
which dogs cause any amount of sin
at times. After a man has toiled hard
all day, and is just dozing off to sleep,
he will be suddenly aroused by a fear-
ful commotion and barking in the back
paddock—caused probably by a cat-fight
(cats out our way are whales at fighting).
Then bang! up goes a window, and the
same stout, undressed gentleman looms
up in the moonlight and hails the dogs
in a voice like a cross-cut saw with
orders to lie down. I don’t know when
he sleeps, for he is beseeching those
dogs more or less up till 2 a.m. or later.
Yet early in the morning I can see
his portly figure, with just about noth-
ing and a half on, considering matters
at the open window as usual, or the
bare shoulders of his wife as she
stands lost in thought with a stocking
in her hand and her eyes fixed on
vacancy. Both of them think harder
than any other two people I know,
and they both think in undress.—

“ Maori ” writes from Kalgoorlie :
The untravelled Australian who takes his matutinal dip
as regularly as his breakfast, would hardly see the point
? f . vo, \ r narration of the discovery of the body of a miss-
mg lodger, putrescent and cobwebbed in the bathroom
of a London hotel. Yet it is an absolute fact that, in
British and Continental hotels, the bathroom is as little
frequented, voluntarily, as the morgue or gaol round the
corner. Last, year, I stayed at many hotels in Italy,
Prance, and Britain, and, fond as I am of a daily douche,
I was astonished at the utter lack of adequate and com-
fortable bathing accommodation in even the most princely
caravanserai. W hen he has recovered from the apoplectic
fit into which your unwonted inquiry has plunged him,
the porter directs you to a 4x2 dungeon, located either
in the bowels of the earth or among the chimney-pots,
furnished with an exceeding primitive and frequently
dirty plunge-bath, and fed by a thin and uncertain stream
of dun-colored water. On the Continent, you are debited
froln 2s g d . to 4s. for this “ luxury,” and in Britain, any-
thing from 2s. to 6s. a go. The price is entirely regulated
by the impeeuniosity of the earls and lords on the direc-
torate of the hotel, as well as by the insolence of the
manager and porter. Also, shower-baths are as prevalent
”1 British a " d Continental hotels as striped dingoes.
The\ r are only met with in Turkish baths. At seaside
resorts, saltwater is as dear as aqua distillata on the gold-
fields. You are furnished with hot and cold seawater at
the extortionate rate of 6d. per 2gal. bucket. In
London, you are charged for every conceivable item
that tht * perferyid imagination of the licensed robber
can conjure to his assistance. You are debited for lights,
fireSi attenda nce, the matutinal cup of tea, everything
except the rancid atmosphere you inhale. And, with it
all, there is no genuine comfort in British hotels—no
bonhommie, no friendliness. Every stranger is avoided
as if he exhaled poison. The snobbishness of the Britisher
up( ? n his ovvn dunghill has passed into a proverb. Abroad
he is a raucous, aggressive, egotistical animal. At Ome
he relapses in^The se mUo.nnolent habitude of the
domestic hog, which he resembles in so many other
respects. Superstitions die hard. Hence the universal
belief that existence to the Britisher would be impossible
without his daily tub.—Maori, Kalgoorlie, Jan. 8, ’9B.

Minister Carruthers’ statement in the
Convention as to how Judges may be influenced
by social and other considerations is peculiarly
interesting, bearing in mind the revelations in the
interesting case of the Queen v. Foster :
Judges have to try cases in Australia, and, very often
before the cases come before them, they know a good
deal as to the private life of litiirants. Consequently,
they sit on the bench with a certain amount of uncon-
scious bias.
This from a man who has “ been there ” is dis-
tinctly valuable testimony.

The S.A. Govt, will, on the superannuation
of Dr. Whittell, probably appoint Dr. Ramsay
Smith chairman of the Central Board of Health and
Adelaide city coroner, thus clearing the way for
the striking hospital doctors to go back to the in-

Napier. That is, they would rather go in as his
colleag* %s than remain outside any longer.

Dr. Alusseil, late medical superintendent
at Adelaide Hospital, intends to take several
weeks in preparing his indictment against the in-
stitution. It is looked for by both sides with in-

Smith. Some people fancy he is waiting for

In Adelaide, when two rival medicoes
meet in the street it generally means a fight

times the spectacle is to be witnessed of two well-
dressed gents going it hammer-and-tongs in the

mother’s in gaol for larceny—biff—biff ! ” Such
scenes are so common since the hospital rows

Globe-trotter Frank Coffee, of Sydney,
just back from the States, says that the straddle-
position necessary upon the bike has so com-
mended itself to the Californian cycladies that
they are now mostly also taking the flesh-and-
blood gee-gee en cavalier. For reasons, however,
connected with the difference between the motions
of the steel steed and the hoofed one, the custom
is not likely completely to catch on—though the
girl, in Honolulu rides astride, and the old Spanish-
Californian lady did so, and the English lady
did the same for many centuries. The extent
to which girls are invading American commercial
life, F. C. says also, was attributed by one business-
man to the fact that women don’t botch their
work in the morning through having been
“ tanked ” overnight, which would be a lot more
convincing if the petticoated article wasn’t bo
much cheaper than the trousered.

The astounding announcement that a hill-
posting co. has been formed in London with a
capital of <£2,500,000 reminds The Bulletin of
the way in which Manly, near Sydney, is be-
ing converted from a beautiful breathing - spot
of Nature into a general huckster’s puffing-ground.
The landscape, in fact, has become mostly Brown’s
Barometrical Bitters, and Jones’s Japanese Jelly,
and Robinson’s Radical Recuperator; and even
when the eye seeks relief seaward it finds that the
“ white wings ” do indeed “ never grow weary ”
of proclaiming the virtues of some nostrum or
another. Manly will, in fact, be soon no better
than one colossal hoarding, and even already it
is said that it pays better to let a building-lot for
gigantic puff-purposes than to erect thereon the
most charming of villas.
Th ere was a terrific rush for the Heading-
ton Hill lands—lately thrown open by Bananaland
Govt. Most of the successful applicants turned

keen and extensive. N.S. Walers and Victorians
are positively rushing Q. of late whenever land is
thrown open. Brisbane papers wickedly insinuate
that the Southern heat-waves of late years are
driving them out, and that they come North to
get cool. And the theory, after all, isn’t so ridi-
culous as it looks at first sight. Writer is prepared
to maintain that Q. is the most salubrious of the

never lost a single officer by disease. This may be
all very well, but the hapless wrecks of one-time

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
„ Sydney, February 8, 1808.
Mr Dear Mtee—
At Govt. House there is much rejoicing over
the fact that the Ferguson baby who arrived last
week is of the right sex, as the welcome little
stranger’s proud parents are now provided with
an heir to many annual thousands. Baby’s outfit
is of the most lavish description, and has been
gushed over by all the feminine friends privileged
to inspect the frillery. Grandma Hampden has
chosen most of the baby’s clothes. The christen-
ing gown was presented by Grandma Paston-
Cooper, and was the one in which the baby’s
father was made a little Christian. A grown man
must gaze with mingled feelings on his own long-
stored-up first garment when he reflects that he
0^ ce k lc ked up his infantile heels in the midst of
all those tu*ks and lace. It’s almost as trying an
ordeal as for a young man, in looking through the
family album with his best girl, to come across an
early photo, of himself sitting in nothingness and
a big shell.
As an understudy for the infernal regions the
Cricket Ground on Saturday was a delirious suc-
cess. A fidgetty crowd of women, too hot to sit
still, roamed up and down the steps and in arid
out of the stands, and audibly gasped for breath,
while men in the pavilion sensibly doffed coats
and vests and sat on them. The heat blistered
the paint on the lawn seats, which stuek to the
clothes of sitters, and these latter tore themselves
away with a loud crack. Many women wore low-cut
neckbands to their gowns, a snappy style for the
young and buxom, but for the scraggy and elderly
the coolth isn’t enough compensation for the
inches of corrugated throat thus revealed. One
dazzler of mature age had her gown-neck cut in
an ample scoop, showing much accordeon-pleated
neck; also, her hat was like a green cab-
bage, and she wore spectacles. Gov. Hampden
and suite were in the vice-regal dock, as closely
screened off as an eastern harem. Extra space
was provided for half-time refreshments, but the
O.C.G. feeding arrangements are still scrambly—
everybody struggles for tea at the same moment,
u s j ru^ le 1S stronger than the tea. Quiet
folk who don t leave their seats are aggravated l>y
perambulating persons with intent to refresh
others, who push up and down the rows, walk
over the sitters’ feet, and do marvellous balancing
acts with brimming teacups and plates of cake.
The Lyceum, at the “Man to Man ’’first night,
was overmanned with a large and lively gallery.
t-'Sj 1 - t j 6 - d‘- c ‘ brightest visiofi was Fannie
Liddiard in pink and a saucy hat in a side-box.
ihe howls from the gods were large and lively,
but the wit in the remarks was as a grain of wheat
in a bushel of chaff. I wonder if gallery-repartee
is a mere tradition? There was one good gag
uttered when Bill Burkley-Harcourt entered the
barn smoking the cigar which he had lit in the
Previous scene. A comment from aloft was,
otill smoking ? Same cigar.” This classic
wheeze and “How dare you, you blackguard?”
are the words from the pantomimes, and
hold the field against all catch-words of the day
except the great Ranji riddle. You won’t be on
a tram or ferry-boat five minutes without hearing
some facetious person remark to his next neigh-
bor : “Ranji is not fair, is he?’ “Why not?”
asks the man who will be had. ‘Oh, because
he s dark, dontcherkiiow,” responds the sharp ‘un.
The Criterion during the Thornton season has
boasted a consistently smart d.c. Fashion has
smiled once more upon the little Cri., which has
housed so many and such variegated shows, from
“ Mrs ; Ebbsmith ”to educated mares. On Mon-
day night the small remnant of local sassiety was
gathered together to behold “ Mamma.” After
the various sturdy old campaigners who have
mother-in-lawed F. Thornton in this part Miss
Pelham looked a very small and mild battler.
Mamma would seem to fall naturally to Miss
Elsie Carew of the co., a lady who seems cut out
by nature to play Mrs. Grundyish parts. Taken
all round, Miss Carew’s “old women ” stand out
as good bits of work, and the lady doesn’t hesitate
to age herself for her parts; but she refused to
wander on in the giddy ballet skirts of the first
act, and the distracted manager had to substitute
a Mamma who wouldn’t object to tights.
The appearance of Ranji in a theatre-box on
Friday night, along with other bat-and-ball heroes,
caused a feminine d.c. to flutter with excitement.
The depreciated rupee magnate sat haughtily for-
ward, and seemed utterly unaware of the battery
of looks which were fired at him all the evening.
When K.S.R. was referred to in one of the panto,
ditties, the gratified warbler scored heavily, and
had to take an encore.
Theatrical damsels fresh from London and its
johnnies mostly snort contemptuously over Aus-
tralian gilded youth. The trouble with the latter
is that they’re not gilded enough. Local admirers
of the drama don’t seem to be so easily “worked
up ” into a diamond-distributing frenzy of admira-
tion as ’Ome jugginses by the seductive sirens of
the stage. They are either too sensible or too poor
or too tired to flutter in the train of the footlight
fairies. Any spare cash the Australian young
man has he generally has had to work so very hard
to get that he regards it vvith a reverence that is
quite Scotch. There is a little set in Sydney that
haunts coulisses and stands a champagne supper
occasionally; but it is always the same set, and
the members distribute their admiration on each
star in turns. Some of these dramatic enthusiasts
are married, but the free-lances of the stage don’t
mind poaching on other women’s preserves. An
operatic girl made a sensation at an afternoon tea-
party lately by announcing her engagement to
Mr. Blank. “ But lie’s married ! ” gasped an
astonished woman. “ Oh, that’s nothing ; his
wife a going to get a divorce, and then we're going
to be married as soon as ever we can,” replied the
damsel, airily. Nobody spoke, and the frozen
silence wasn’t broken up till the “engaged ” girl
took her leave, which she did almost immediately.
Many readers are snorting occasionally over the
pretty weddings,’’and “ handsome "and “charm-
ing ” and “ lovely ” and “ blushing ” brides gushed
over by the social penfemale when she gets her
hand well in on a fashionable marriage, but she
doesn’t make such a hash of it as the man-reporter
when he has to wrestle with wedding reports on
his benighted own. Miss Gough, daughter of the
proprietor of the Charters Towers play-house, was
married to Mr. R. Hancome lately, and this is
how the local paper writes up the honeymoon
finery:—“The travelling costume was a pretty
Irish poplin designed in lentil-and-wattle (what-
ever that may be) toque to correspond ; also, a St.
Clair hat in white-pearl straw, with trimmings of
summer blossoms, bridal effects and aigrettes
which matched the costumes, and is to be worn
with it.” So the bride evidently went off with
two hats on, which must have been a startling
“ bridal effect.”
As a fashionable caper, the chain-wearing craze
has now reached an idiotic pitch. Every woman
who possesses any old gold neck-cables is disinter-
ring them from the recesses where they had been
stored away as out-of-date lumber, and, having
them furbished up, sports the metal links round
her neck with assorted plated-ware clanking there-
from. A newly-arrived woman, staying at a
high-priced Sydney pub., is exhibiting just now
the very latest chain-arrangement. She is liter-
ally chained-up in heavy links, which bind her
round the waist and dangle to her skirt-hem,
where a rattling collection of gilded tinware
clatters every time she moves her tootsies.
A returned Australian, Bessie Doyle, the
melodious' fiddler, otherwise known as Eileen
o‘Moore, is sojourning in Sydney after her ’Ome
tour. She has brought out the latest notion in
hair-dressing, and, like all recent importations
from the other side, shows that present-day wiggery
is still modelled on the lines of a birch-broom in a
fit. With high lights carefully brought out and
towzled side-wisps and an absurd little nut twisted
somewhere up among the tangles, the head of
woman, according to latest dressing, is a horror of
untidy dishevelment. Four sensational dancers
lately domiciled for a time here attracted atten-
tion not only by their frocks, which were French
and frilly, but by their hair which was ditto ;
also their manners, which were quite as ditto as
their hair.
A ladies’ bar would be a great boon at the
cricket-matches—a place where ladies could line
up and take their threepenny ic d drinks as they
do at Washington Soul’s, the marvellously-busy
American bar in Pitt-street. As a change from
monotonous tea, soda drinks, flavored with dif-
ferent fruits, are becoming increasingly popular.
At Soul’s, thirsty women refresh themselves at a
“ real elegant ” marble bar of their own, which is
situated beyond the men’s bar in this the only
Australian example of a Yankee drug-store.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ There is absolutely no feminine interest in the
proceedings of the Convention in Melbourne.
The women flock to the bi-weekly tea-fights on the
lawn at Parliament House, but at other times a
petticoat is a rarity, and the ladies’ gallery is
chronically empty. Even the little curiosity there
was to behold Carruthers has died out. Carruthers
spoiled himself as a show by marrying again.
“ Iu the streets, this week, the public eye has
been lacerated and reddened by rolling smoke-
clouds from the bush-fires. One breathed fine
dust flavored with smoke, and the whole topic of
conversation among meeting friends was the bush-
fires, or the Big Fire ; in fact, even Cricket was
eclipsed by Fire. Supt. Stein’s invitation to view
the up-to-date fire-extinguishing implements at
the M.F.B. station was thought most seasonable.
The invitation, however, called forth but a paltry
number of distinguished visitors, most of those
present being local people anxious to see engines
wonderful enough to extinguish the prevailing
topic. The whole plan of the station appeared
simple enough, when a large blaze is espied some-
one on hand presses a button and the brigades do
the rest. The one question tabu on Thursday
evening was ‘ at what time was the Big Fire dis-
covered?” None dared to ask that on pain of
being run over by the * steamer ’ or shot down the
‘greasy pole.’ Cool refreshments were served
when the inspection was over, and the guests de-
parted into the smoky streets, made picturesque by
the gutted waste of the Big Fire, while the blood-
red fiery moon silently gazed down on hoardings
with the epidemic word in gigantic letters upon
them—FlßE.
“ The ideal hot-weather garments for men have
evidently never been discovered. When a man
feels that his accustomed serge coat and trousers
are hot to suffocation, he reaches out vaguely for
the first cool-looking vestments which come to
hand, and generally succee'ds in converting a re-
spectable and sober-looking citizen into a highly-
colored caricature. At Friday’s Parliamentary
garden-party, with the exception of the ‘ only
young man of the Convention ’ and a few Pre-
miers who martyred themselves in the ‘ correct ’
frock coat and silk hat of civilisation, each
man seemed more fantastically arrayed than
the other. One walked abroad frankly in pyjamas !
Another displayed a tasteful coat of pongee silk of
a light copper hue; several favored alpaca as
material for coat and vest; some few wore flappy
archaic-looking ‘silk dusters,’with pants of white
linen, which gave the wearers a strangely unclad
appearance. One Labor-member looked coolly
clad—at a distance; at hand, his pale-lavender
tweed suit and broad cummerbund looked stuffy,
and his collar and tie suggested asphyxia. To do
the unhappy males justice, one must say that they
all looked thoroughly uncomfortable and self-
conscious in the unusual garments, the wearers of
which seemed hotter than the black - coated
minority.
“ The women on the whole were somewhat limp-
looking and dowdy, though two or three really
smart gowns showed up well in a rather shabby
assemblage. Lady Brassey was in dove-grey
crSpe de Chine —one of her prettiest frocks; the
Vic. Premier’s wife wore a hot-looking gown of
black-striped gauze over copper satin; both her
daughters were in undistinguished-looking blue-
flowered silks. Mrs. G. H. Reid’s exquisite helio-
trope foulard, fascinatingly fixed with fluted
chiffon of ‘baby’ ribbon, was an easy winner in
the dress parade, though the Mayoress, in dainty
white silk and touches of turquoise velvet, came
very close up. A tall blonde in grey chiffon and
silk, and a handsome brunette in biscuit-silk with
carnation velvet belt—both of whom were stran-
gers, by the way—attracted much admiring com-
ment. Miss Lilia M'Carthy, all in fluffy-white
with a large befeathered hat, managed to look the
coolest person present. Everyone was on the
look out for the bride, Mrs. Carruthers, but she
and hubby had hied themselves to Warrnambool
in search of coolth and retirement till Monday
morning.
“The garden-party was dubbed by the un-
regenerate the Day of Resurrection. The
graves gave up their political dead, for the
Ministry had extended their invitations to all
the ex-M’sP. who could be found. Political
corpses gibbered on the lawn and shook skele-
ton hands from which the flesh of reputation
had been eaten by the worm of retribution. Dave
M'Lellan from Ararat, Eucalyptus Bosisto, Dicky
Dicky of Irish Creek (erstwhile Minister of Rail-
ways under Patterson), Mat Davies, Munro, and
many another dead ’un, had emerged from the
tomb at the sound of the Convention trump, and
ate and drank with the zeal of the old politician.
In the midst of so much death, people half-
expected to see Patterson, Grant, M‘Bain, M'Cul-
loch, O’Shanassy, and other old timers ; but either
because they were too defunct, or because (despite
the extreme heat) they were afraid of catching
cold, they did not venture out.
“ Mrs. Premier Turner, as hostess for the
Government, was magnificent. In a shimmering
old-gold silk frock, the color of her hair, she ‘ re-
ceived ’ on a big mat in the entrance hall, whilst
hubby, in an exceedingly uncomfortable frock-
coat and a vigorous perspiration, handed the visi-
tors along to where the ‘grub ’ and the ices were.
Madame kept a smile on the go all the time and
said the proper thing at the proper time. That
European trip was educational.
“ The delegates, from a woman’s point of view,
are a rather shabbily-dressed, unattractive sot of
men. Some newspapers have given to Sir E.
Braddon the beauty-prize of the collection—a pic-
ture of the gentleman lately appeared in a weekly
as the “ handsomest delegate ” —but, were women
allowed to judge, they would probably decide in
favor of the well-groomed, clean-shaven Mr. James,
of Westralia. B. R. Wise spoils his otherwise
taking-appearance by sporting a tweed suit of a
ghastly underdone-grey tone, which does not
somehow suit his complexion, and a small straw
hat, in which he looks almost boyish. Premier
Turner, by the way, has also a juvenile style of
dressing, and wears his hair so neatly smoothed
down that he looks like Tommy Good-Boy, whom
mother has just brushed up, and cautioned
against ‘ mussing ’ his collar. Poor old Graham
Berry has become very lame of late, but his fine-
cut pale face is one of the most distinguished-look-
ing in the chamber.
“ The Victorian Government learned a valu-
able lesson from the disgusting fiasco of the famous
Hawkesbury excursion in N.S.W. They rigidly
confined their Bay excursion to Conventionists
and those connected with the Convention. The
pressure brought to bear from all sorts of quarters
m order to get tickets was extraordinary. Heads
of departments declared they had never been so
much insulted in their lives, suburban Mayors
spluttered in purple wrath, the aunts, cousins and
mothers-in-law of MAP. threatened, and the
junior but pushing Civil Service was shocked.
Nevertheless the shivoo was strictly restrained—
and was a success.
“One of the most irresistible tricks of the
beauteous—she really is a beauty- Maud Jeffries,
is her contempt for corsets. In no play of Wilson
Barrett’s, up to date, has the dark-eyed Maud en-
circled her voluptuous form in aught but draperies,
and consequently the audience has been free to
revel in the fetching curves of areal live woman
that it wants to cuddle on the spot, instead of a
combination of steel and whalebone and woman
that has no “ points ” different from any other.
“On the boards, at all events, the Manx folk
are not a dressy crowd. The girls cling to a kirtle
and kerchief, ‘Caller Herrin’ style of costume,
while the men affect patchwork pants and jer-
seys that look as if, year in, vear out, their
owners smoked, swam, and slept in them. In
the Manx community, as elsewhere, H.E.
the Governor apparently rules the social roost.'
His Honor the Deemster and My Lord Bishop
perch a peg lower down, and the fisher-folk don’t
count. In so limited a circle of ‘Nicest,’ ‘Mona
Mylrea,’ as unopposed belle, has no rival to dress
against, and is, moreover, aware that, dress or no
dress, she boasts two jarring strings to her bow.
Under these non-competitive conditions, small
blame to her if she indulges in that comfortable
free-and-easy bunchiness of dress-cut, formerly
affected by the Manxman’s mopish wife ; yards of
stuff in her skirts, and so on.
“Yet, for the average woman, circumstances
alter cases. In a classical robe of soft
filmy silk, the more the material, the better
the effect, but flops and trollops of sombre
serge, cashmere or homespun, wipe out all im-
pression of daintiness. Not only is the stuff in
itself ever so much clumsier, but woollen dress-
goods, in the nature of things, can’t visit the
wash-tub every Monday.
“ However, tailor-made or not, Maud Jeffries
makes Mona quite winsome enough to set all her
male belongings by the ears. With her first
greenish gown she wears a becoming white cap •

doubtful, both in regard to the man and the Firm •
but the case of Baritone C. was bad for every-

Example is potent, ye ken, and one knows
whom to thank for the fact that the Melbourne
-Nicest no longer live up to their reputation for
lavishness and display. The gift-show at a recent
fashionable wedding would have brought tears of
disappointment to the eyes of a bank-clerk’s bride.
from a distance, the collection looked a
shabby likeness of ‘our salvage sixpenny stock,’
and the items improved very little on closer
acquaintance. The centre-piece, so to speak, was
an unobtrusive copy of ‘ Our Voyage in the Sun-
beam, flanked by an unframed photo, of Lady
Brassey, while a companion picture of her grand-
daughter boasted only the most inexpensive of
settings. A gilded haberdashery clan had sent
along an unpretentious blotter ; so did an upper-
crust sporting family, and the wife of a mighty
I‘ttl 6rS " ane ma B was represented by a mangy
These offerings seemed shockingly dispropor-
tionate to the splendor of the mlptial banquet,
though generally it’s the other way round, and
mercenary donors of costly presents feel them-
selves defrauded by the frugality of the feast. A
year or two back, in one of pur richest squatting
districts, the whole country-side was invited to a
wedding at the show homestead of the vicinity, a
favorite haunt of vice-regality. The trouble began
when the guests, halting at the only inn there-
abouts to preen their feathers after their long
drive before proceeding to church, found that
every drop and crumb in the place had been
bought up by their host elect. Apart from their
unsatisfied pangs, this discovery omened so
hideously for the quality of the day’s vintage and
victuallage, that .the to-be-guests were inclined to
forecast the menu as an outrage and turn home
then and there. In the end, they were per-
suaded to sit out the church ceremony, and
then came another drive to the bride’s old
home, followed by an ethereal, ghostly sort of
refection, nothing but jellies, confectionery, and
soft drinks. Such as it was, it was approached in
relays, only one room of the spacious mansion
having been utilised, owing to the hosts’ mis-
jjlaced adherence to a light-refreshment, after-
noon-tea phase of hospitality. At last a detach-
ment of hungry men, tired of tussling for snack*
for their womenltind, turned tlieir attention to
their own wants, only to find the tables absolutely
bare of food. They bribed and threatened maids
vain » girls declared there was nothing in
the house. I inally an old campaigner stormed a
kitchen safe, and unearthed some bread, cold
corned beef and pickles, presumably mine host’s
to-morrow s breakfast. Anyway, the explorers
made short work of it, and to this day the only
bright spot in that hideous retrospect is the thought
of the gentleman s discomfiture when he found
‘ his cupboard was bare. ’
“A n ex-aide had his faults, nevertheless he was
a sweet singer. The Governor’s son-in-law will
never fill the departed’s vocal shoes, though he
works hard according to Italian methods, and
shakes himself, during his performance, like a
canary-bird contemplating a trill.
Yours faithfully,
CLEO.

suicided, and his successor, who, in time married
the widow, has since been sent to take the place

Among applicants for a hawker’s license

Thunderbolt’s fall. Constable Walker, Cappu-
sotti, and others dogged the outlaw till a bullet
from the constable closed his career. Cappusotti
was a hawker in those days, and, as his license for
1898 shows, he is a hawker still.

staggered by a bullet fired by Super. Morrisett, he
rejoiced to find that the shot had smashed his
watch, leaving only a fragment of the case attached
to the ring. This fragment he ever after kept as
a charm—but somehow it didn’t act.
When the late Tennyson accepted a peer-
age he told a friend that he only did it “on
account of the boy.” He couldn’t shunt the re-
sponsibility on the old woman, for she was dead.
And if there hadn’t been any son or other near
relative available he would probably have said that
only took his “ honor ” to gratify his late wife’s
elder sister’s husband.' How long is it since any
man grabbed a title with both hands and his two
feet and all his teeth without explaining that he
accepted it with extreme reluctance to gratify
some relative or other?
The latest photo, of Bishop Moorhouse
shows him to have aged terribly during his twelve
years’ work in Manchester; he looks almost a 8
old as did the nonagenarian Dean Macartney.
At Manchester his course has been marked
by strict attention to duty, and that is all.
He made a mistake in going there, except
from the paltry view of double wages, four
thou, instead of two, because in England
he is only one of a crowd after all. How
much more he would have accomplished
in Melb., from ’B6 to ’9B, than Low and
mossy Goe !
In a recent interview with a more
or less inspired London journalist, Phil
May is reported as having said that
he did not recommend the lesson of
his own experience, inasmuch as he
taught himself to draw. He now con-
siders that if one loses nothing else, one
loses time. But who will seriously say
that the creator of “ Guttersnipes ”
has lost aught—even time—by teaching
himself to draw ? The certitude and
brilliancy of Phil May’s work is not to
be acquired from any master. It is in
itself the basic necessity of a school ;
though, unfortunately, all the scholars are
copyists—of Phil May. In art no one can
help the artist, though the artist is of infinite
value to the conscientious and painstaking
journeyman.
Bishop Harmer (Anglican) has con-
descended to return to Adelaide after a year’s
absence, but it is suggested that he has only
dropped in to sign up for past salary and arrange
for his final departure for ’Ome. Why the bow-
legged little man came back at all is a mystery.
The Rev. Stanley Mitchell, who died lately
on the N.S.W. south coast, was Sydney-born. His
father, a big trader, left a couple of hundred thou-
sand pounds to Stanley, but not a penny to either
of the surviving daughters. The young parson,
on proving the will, handed each of them a cheque
for .£50,000.
Tired of classical derivations, meteorolo-
gist Wragge has hunted up a new fount of meteoro-
logical nomenclature. “I intend,” he remarks,
to adopt the names of South Sea beauties for
my storms ! ” Hence the latest aerial disturbance
has been christened Eline—a name sweetly sug-
gestive of armfuls of luscious Samoan maidenhood
—daintily ripened on yam, taro, and “long pig.”
Further, the weather-man remarks that mothers
would do well to christen their little girls on
similar principles.
that Oscar Wilde is living in desti-
tution in Naples, his wife having withdrawn the
allowance she made him contingent upon his
having nothing more to do with young Alfred
Douglas—who, it is asserted, followed him imme-
diately to Naples. However, the destitution part
of the story is quite unlikely—for unless Wilde’s
brain has given way, he can always earn heaps of
money. And when he contributed those articles
to London Daily Chronicle just after his release
he was evidently in great intellectual trim.
Even when a very small and ordinary boy
in M.L., the Earl of Seafield and his younger
brother were already subject to the adulation of
many toadies, who would have devoted more
kicks than kindness to the mere offspring of an
Oamaru ex-bailiff. If Seafield sticks to Maori-
land, and jusc lolls about without doing anything
noteworthy, he is still certain to be boosted into
politics and everything else that’s on. He is
already an officer of volunteers, and sleepy Oamaru
is just the place to wear out its trousers at the
knees in adoration of any man with a title.
Yet another defection from the Sydney
D.T. staff, in the person of that able-all-round man
leader-writer Taperell, who goes back to his native
M.L., to control the Wellington Times. “Tap.”
was about the most representative Maorilander on
the Sydney press, and no man could tell better
yarns of old Hori Grey. When the ancient came
over for the ’9l Federal Convention, he met Tape-
rdl, who had, of course, shaken off the familiar
M.L. great-coat, and adopted lighter garments.
“Morning, Taperell” quoth Hori; “getting
along all right, Taperell ? H-m-m—l see you’ve
got a new coat, Taperell.”
E. O. M‘Devitt, who died last week, ad-
mitted that the mistake of his life, from a politi-
cal and professional point of view, lay in his quit-
ting Queensland when and how he did. He had
tried Melbourne and Sydney without success, but
no sooner did he touch Brisbane than, owing to a
number of unanticipated friendships, he was floated
into the position of chief law-officer of the Crown.
A political career and extensive legal practice
opened to him, but, with a notion of becoming
M.P, in the British Parliament, he cut himself
adrift from both. The influence of his brother, a
R.C. bishop, was exerted in Ireland on his behalf,
but wherever he went he was a frost. Finally he
toddled back to Australia, out of sorts with the
world, and stayed, rather than lived, in Melbourne.
Death found him at 53 as old in feelings and affec-
tions as an average man of seventy.
George Lang, recently re-planted, was one
time council-clerk at Gladstone (Q.). Once a
friend called on him, on his way to Rockhampton.
The council was sitting, but Lang arose, left them
at it, locked the front and only door, and forgot
about everything except good-fellowship. This
was about 8 p.m. At midnight the steamer’s bell
rang up stray passengers. On the way down the
council-chamber was passed. Sounds of hammer-
ing and kicking were heard within. From the
window above the door half of a profane and in-
furiated alderman protruded. “By Jove ! ” said
George ; “ I forgot the corporation ” ; and he ran
to unlock the door. His friend passed on. A
fortnight thereafter he received a letter from
Lang : “ Just out of bed. Laid up ever since you
left. They all sat on me.” But they didn’t sack
him. Thereafter, however, duplicate keys were
provided, and the Mayor kept one. The corpora-
tion had been locked in for four hours without a
drink, and it didn’t want any more experiences of
that kind.

Melb. Age obituary :
PICKETT.—On the 31st. January, George Pickett,
butcher, of Hertfordshire, England, aged 75 years, a
colonist of 45 years.
All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
thereof ; the grass vvithereth and the flower falleth away.
The veteran Peter Phillips, secretary and
often dictator of Bendigo Miners’ Association, who,
during the last year, allowed his rugged old Con-
servatism to several times make an ass of the
’sociation, has just had a tight shave to get back
to a billet which he has held for a generation. The
outlying sub-branches saved him.
N.S.W. Savings Bank, which has now for
head the most belligerent of intermittent politi-
cians, G. R. Dibbs, had as his predecessor for a
quarter of a century the quiet, ever-exact Henry
Wise, who never used voice or pen in support of
any political party, and, as a general rule, even
avoided casting a vote in contested elections.
Died lately at Bulong, Harry Waldock,
who had a better claim than most to be called a
Westralian goldfields pioneer. He went from
Bendigo to Kimberley when that rocky disap-
pointment first wore out prospectors’ boots and
broke their hearts, and hung on to the place ever
since. He was among the first half-dozen on
Coolgardie.
F. T. Brentnall, M.L.C., whom the Wes-
leyan Board welcomed to Sydney the other day,
was first appointed to Q. Leg. Council Chairman-
ship by the redoubtable MTlwraith. Brentnall,
in Brisbane Telegraph, had supported the land-
grant policy then in favor. Thirty-four years ago
he officiated as a parson in Brisbane, butdie doffed
the white choker for the pension-list.
Michael Burke,
an announced Parlia-
mentary candidate
for Tamworth (N.S.
W.), claims to be the
first white native of
that district.
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT?
THE P.M.: “ Fined five pounds or three months.”
THE POLICEMAN: “ Have you got any property? ”
ACCUSED: “ Yes .”
THE POLICEMAN: “ What property have you got?”
ACCUSED: “ I have a hat and a handkerchief! ”
A Q. ex-official, before leaving for ’Ome
the other day, called on his former chief. “ I’ve
just dropped in, Mr. , to tell you you’re an
ass. Also, as I’m leaving for England, allow me
to tell you you’re a d d ass. Good morning ! ”
The flustered head of department shortly after-
wards met two prominent civil servants, and
spoke of “the man’s insolence —he must be a
lunatic ! ” “ Well,” said one of his companions,
“perhaps he is; but you know he has his lucid
moments.”
Michael Flurscheim, described as a “ Swiss
socialist,” probably because he isn’t a Swiss and
isn’t a socialist, is a short, square-built German
Hebrew, and wealthy. Trained in the traditions
of German Jewish banking, he went, when a
young man, to the States, and, after a spell in
commerce there, returned to Baden and set up a big
machine-shop, which grew till, in 20 years, he was
employing 1000 people and owned and worked 100
patents. In 1882 Henry George’s “ Progress and
Poverty ” changed his ideals, and he sold out and
set himself to founding land-nationalising societies
in Germany and Switzerland. In Well in-ton,
M.L., where he will settle, he means to work
for the same end, and also purposes found-
ing an Exchange Credit Bank on plan which
allows members loans of goods from other
members on personal security. Although not
technically a socialist, be is permeated with the
socialist spirit, and only abjures sccialist methods
because he believes that, once monopoly in land
is abolished, the rule of the land-supported
capitalist and investor-parasite must cease, and
that the demand for labor would so increase that
the workman could afford to dispense with the
protection of Factory Acts and the minimum wage.
His constant advice is—“ Stick to the one idea—
the land for the people; and use what methods
you can. Compensate vested interests where pos-
sible. If not, then go with the Single-taxers.
Here Protection may be good, here Freetrade.”
Ignatius Singer (erstwhile of Adelaide Com-
monwealth), who accompanies Flurscheim, is
the Hungarian who wrote anonymously “The
Story of mv Dictatorship,” “Government by the
People,” &c. He will establish a chemical factory
in Wellington and will back up his friend in the
bank project.
Among the pictures recently added to the
Loan Collection of the N.S.W. National Gallery
is a fine portrait of a lady from the brush of that
sterling artist John Longstaff. Like most of
Longstaff’s portrait work, the accessories are
allowed in no way to detract from the human in-
terest of the subject. The background is in-
definite, the fabics black or dark, the one point of
inanimate color, as in “A Lady in Black,” pur-
chased by the Gallery Trustees—a bunch of violets.
The . blossoms . serve to relieve the sombre
details of the subject’s hat. The flesh is
luminous, and the features as surely modelled as
by the thumb of a master in statuary. The eyes
are finely instinct with an intelligence in every
respect consonant with the type pourtrayed. It
is a beautiful face, in which the artist has thrown
a flash of genius by virtue of an unerring insight.
The technique is adequate, and conscientiously
sound. The picture is entirely devoid of the
clever trickery which so often mars the work of
promising men, who rely for success rather on
legerdemain than on knowledge.
The flame which
artist Julian Ashton lit
in Sydney studios has
expired, but red-hot
embers still smoulder.
Yet probably most of
Ashton’s enemies-,
would admit that, if
not the Napoleon, he is
at least the Te Kooti
of Australian art. The
late president of N.S.
W. Art Society, and
present president of
N.S.W. Society of Ar-
tists, is an aggressive
business man —an or-
ganiser to his finger-
tips. His connection
with art in Sydney has
lifted it out of the
domain of dilettantism
and amateurism into
the region of profes-
sional craftsmanship.
His eagerness to sell
and to make a market
for his wares has
stimulated the pro-
duction of wares worth
buying. His enthusiasm has reacted on
his brothers of the brush, and, mainly
through his efforts, the professional artist,
the man who paints pictures for a living,
has a distinct locus standi in Sydney ;
and, Competitively emulative, in Melbourne
also. No doubt Mr. Ashton fought for
his own hand—as which of us does not?—
but indubitably he has benefited his fel-
low artists. A taste once created seeks
satisfaction in variety. And few people
doubt that on the whole Julian Ashton’s
inclusion among N.S.W. National Gallery
trustees has been a real boon to Aus-
tralian art, and has helped to make a live-
lihood for Australian artists. Yet his re-
cent action makes him well-nigh impossible as a co-
worker with the other N.S.W. professional artists.
So, as he knows so well what Australians want, and
as his experience is great and his judgment excel-
lent in most matters of art, is it impossible to
utilise him as a buyer for N.S.W. Gallery in the
English market? The appointment would pro-
bably save taxpayers’ pockets-some thousands in
hard coin, and taxpayers’ eyesight nameless
affronts in the form of yards of artistic “ tripe.”

In the bad old days of the North the most
dignified boarding-house in a certain city had for
its permanent residents an editor, a Judge, three
politicians, one or two merchants, and a barrister.
The house was run by two sisters, both unmarried,
and prided itself upon its smirchless Respect-
ability. One night, about 10.30, the editor, the
Judge, and a couple of politicians were play-
ing nap in the smoking-room when the elder
of the two ladies appeared and announced, “ Don’t
be alarmed, gentlemen. My sister is going to
ring the dinner-bell and I am going to call out
‘Fire! fire!’” “Whatever is that for, Mias
?” “Oil, never mind, but you just watch
Mr. Boggs’s room when I call fire.” The beH
rang furiously. “ Fire ! fire ! ” screamed Miss .
The barrister’s bedroom door opened, and out
flew a partially-clad female, like an arrow from
a bow, straight for the front gate. The land-
lady made a snatch at the figure, but she
might as well have tried to grab an eel
amidships. Bareheaded, however, she rushed
after the scared, immoral apparition, think-
ing prayers to the effect that she might over-
take, collar, and identify the bold, bad female.
The latter raced for a feriy, Miss close be-
hind. A boat had just left the landing-stage, and
was quite 6ft. off, when the scared flyer gave a
wild leap and landed on the ferryman’s shoulders !
The panting, disappointed landlady could only
gasp her opinions on “ such conduct,” and return
to her own house. . . . “ Mr. Boggs,” she said,
sternly, “ you will oblige me by seeking accommo-
ciation elsewhere. But, oh ! I wish I knew who
the low hussy was.” The barrister left before
breakfast next morning. . . . And the identity of
the parti ally-dressed lady who ran for her life that-
hot summer night is as utterly a mvstery as ever.

Quinlan had been told of a payable block
left in an old mine near Beechworth, Vic., and,
dropping a slab across the shaft, he went below to
investigate. He stayed in the drive a minute or
two, and then became possessed by a powerful
inclination to lie down and die comfortably. But
Quinlan had been in foul-air before, and knew the
sensation, and he went for his rope and shinned up
the shaft again as fast as he could. About 20ft.
from the surface the miner suddenly ceased climb-
ing and hung there as still as a sleeping monkey
bear. Coiled around the inch-manilla a foot or
two higher up was a five-foot snake, its shape dis-
tinctly visible, and its eyes shining like tiny
sparks in the dim light. Quinlan was in a tight
place. The bad air disturbed by his movements
was rising in the shaft, and the man knew per-
fectly well that if he went below again ho would
go to his death. There was nothing for it but to
wait, watch and pray. Quinlan hung on till
every bone in Ins
body ached horri-
bly, and the snake
above had nob
winked or moved a
muscle, and then
he determined at
least to have a flut-
ter for his life.
Spieiding his legs
he secured a pre-
carious grip on the
AS USUAL.
“ And so your father has a new set of teeth. What will he do
with his old ones?”
“ Oh, I s’pose they’ll cut ’em down and make me wear ’em!”
sidea of the shaft, then, drawing the rope up
a few inches, he jerked it sharply. The
snake flew from the rope, flopped into Quin-
lan’s face, slid down his breast, and went plunk
into the water below. When the fossicker “ re-
membered himself ” again he was sprawling on
i he grass, but he has not the vaguest recollection
of how he got there.

Dear Bulletin, — Re men lost in the bush
travelling in circles. A few minutes ago I rescued
a fly which had fallen in my inkpot, and placed it
cm a clean sheet of paper. It left an oval track of
violet h hin I it as it staggered along trying to clear
the ink out of its eyes with its antennas. When
it had leeov led its sight it moved in a more or
less straight line. I think the great reason why
men lost in the bush walk in circles is that
they have lost their power of resistance
against the natural law which causes all things
that have no volition of their own to move
in curves. A tree and a man grow spirally. To
proceed in a straight line implies desire and
ability to defy this law. I have seen a drunken
man- -using his umbrella as a pivot—making his
way home by a system of circular sailing
applied to land. He had preserved the de-
sire to proceed in a straight line, but had lost tho
ability to altogether resist the Law of Circular
Motion. So the Man and the Law compromised,
and the former, I suppose, got home a few hours
later than he would have done had he been less
drunk and so able to make a sterner compromise
with the Law by zigzagging. Lookingat thematter
from another point of view, how is it that straight
lines and sharp angles, though convenient for
practical purposes, are to all men hateful? Who
likes to see a square-shouldered woman ? But
picture her with square breasts and hips ! An
ingenious French author, whose works I read
many years ago, says that we get our love for
curves from stroking our mothers’ breasts when
we are in the suckling stage. Who knows ? I
think, however, that it rests on a deeper founda-
tion. Anyhow, the very mathematicians tell us
that there is no such thing in existence as a
straight line. Then why go to such trouble to
keep “straight” when we might so easily and
pleasantly and naturally go say, curved ?

H.L.G. : Sheep have been known to eat
dead rabbits, and cows chew bones. Some time
ago Slater was rounding up some sheep in one of
his Goomalyn paddocks, and when the dog came
along an old ewe hastily dropped a bone she was
mumbling and joined the mob. Nearly six months
afterwards the mob was being driven past the
same place when the old ewe deliberately walked
out straight to where she had dropped her bone so
long before and picked it up ! Also, I know a
man who has a cow that would leave a feed of
ohaff to munch a decomposed iguana.

Dear Bulletin, — Yarn about
fishes roasted by bush-fires in Tas-
manian river isn’t necessarily a fish-
lie. In Jan. and Feb., ’96, on the
Lower Macquarie River, 60 miles
below Warren (N.S.W.) I saw hun-
dreds of cod, varying in weight
from 6 to 801 b., dead and festering
on the surface of numerous water-
holes. The heat-wave, accelerated
probably by hunger, had killed
them. Cannibalism was common
with them then, and is always so
when drought-stricken. Extremes
of. heat and cold kill thousands of
Australian fish.’—H. J. M'Cooey.
[Cannibalism is normal with many
fishes. —Ed. B.]

Australia being essentially a
drought - cursed land, Australian
parsons are also necessarily a rain-
praying lot of.medicine-men. Mex-
ico is also droughty, and also much
given to supplication in dry seasons.
A certain Christian sect, however,
in that sombre Cactus Land, has
carried the rain-praying business to
a degree of perfection hitherto un-
dreamed of in this country. A
notice to the Lord is published to
the effect that, if rain be not sent
in answer to prayer and self-sacri-
fice by a certain date, the parties
supplicating will thereafter imme-
diately recommence their sinful
courses and be wickeder than ever.
. - . If this doesn’t make Heaven
sit up, nothing ever will. . .
Ridiculous—is it? Not a whit more
ridiculous than flopping on your
knees and hoping thereby to effect
an instantaneous deflection of natu-
ral law.

In the fifties things were done, in Victoria,
in a free-and-easy, unconventional way. The
writer remembers staying at Murphy’s Castle,
maine Hotel when the sessions were on, and at the
dinner-table aloijg with the Judge on circuit, his
Associate, the Grown Prosecutor, and a number
of barristers, were several persons charged with
criminal offences but out on bail. Among these
were two young men from Smythesdale, who
wore to take their trial for tarring-and-feathering
a man. After dinner, at the suggestion of bibu-
NO WONDER HE FELT IT.
INEBRIATED PARTY: “Great Scott! what a
temperature — 520!"
lous little barrister M‘Donough (known as John
Philpott Curran), the table was removed. Quinn,
a surveyor, produced his fiddle, and soon was pre-
sented an astonishing spectacle, Judge, men on
the jury-list, solicitors, barristers, and offenders
whooping around in jig, and reel, and polka, and
waltz, until the morning hours, when broiled
bones and whisky-punch finished up the saturnalia.
Next day every peg fitted into its proper place.
The people on bail gave themselves up. The
Judge sat. The Crown Prosecutor thundered his
charges against men with wltom he had hobnobbed
the night before. And the two young fellows
tried for tarring-and-feathering got three years
“ hard.” As G. V. Brooke (one of the company)
observed : “ They never did it better in Ireland.”

A swagger struck Foxton (M.L.), the other
day, and went round to the back-door of the local
storekeeper and quietly asked for a bit of tucker.
The wood-heap was pointed out to him. The
storekeeper was surprised at the readiness with
which the hint was accepted, and at the marvel-
lous way chips flew from under that swagman’s
axe. The surprise was added to a couple of hours
later, when that individual presented himself with
a demand, not for tucker, but spot cash, and ten-
dered a lucid explanation of the Truck Act. The
cash forthcame.

The irony of fate with a vengeance ! Also
a warning lesson to cold-tea howlers. In a
western N.S.W. township a beer-loving black-
tracker joined the Harmy, and faithfully adhered to
the rules of the big drum. Neither love nor money
could entice him to touch intoxicating beverages
after his conversion. One very hot day he accom-
panied his sergeant on a thief-hunting expedition.
They had no water-bags, and when they reached
a wayside pub. the sergeant fairly rushed & long
whisky-and-water. The nigger shook his head at
all invitations to a drink, and helped himself out
of the water-bag instead. Being very heated the
cold water gave him a chill, which killed him that
night.
Sydney Charities.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
This writer, after a spell of a year’s casual labor,
on which he just managed to exist, recently spent
two terms of ten weeks each in hospital, with a
semi-convalescent interval of eight weeks. Thesa
notes are based on his experiences during those
eight weeks, and on those of his wife and child
while he was in hospital. He was desperate, bub
methodical; and wanted to know things. Bitter
articles are from time to time published by the
great dailies ” of Sydney— presumably at the in-
stigation of charity-experts— regarding the horrors
of “overlapping” in connection with local chari-
ties. An overlapper is a person who, by any
means, obtains assistance from two or more elee-
mosynary institutions at the same time ; and a
fundamental rule of every metropolitan charity is
that no person, under any circumstances whatever,
may become an overlapper.
* * * *
Sydney Charity Organisation Society, in order
to suppress the nefarious practice, arranged that
charity societies should carefully compare the
names and addresses of people relieved, and any
reliefer found guilty of overlapping is black-listed
all round and refused further assistance. This
check-system has caused much newspaper writing
and has supplied smug philanthropists with an
excellent excuse for every shortcoming of their
societies. When a destitute appeals for relief,
nearly every society holds up its hands in pious
horror, and regrets that it cannot assist him, as
overlapping has exhausted its funds. When the
public donor growls because the “ expenses ” are
out of proportion to the “charity,” the charity-
expert points out that this is all through the ao
cursed overlapping.

supplied to a family of two adults and one child
for five weeks (different society each week).
Charity Organisation Society : 7 loaves of bread, Jib, of
tea, 1 tin condensed milk, 21b. white sugar. Cash value,
3s. Id.
City Mission : An order for 2s. worth of groceries, and
6d. for meat. Total, 2s. 6d.
Sydney Rescue Work Society : 2s. 6d. in cash. Total,
2s. 6d.
Sydney Benevolent Society : 4 loaves of bread, 21b.
meat, lib. of brown sugar, Jib- of tea, and Jib. rice.
Cash value, Is. BJd.
Sydney Night Refuge and City Soup Kitchen satisfied
itself that applicant bore a good character, was really in
need, and supplied bread, meat, cocoa, and sugar on day
of application, and at noon each subsequent day supplied
sufficient soup and bread to last till next issue.
* * * *
The total value of the relief supplied by the first
four societies during four weeks was 9s. 9r,d., or
less than Hul. per week for each person. Con-
templation of this caricature should prove to any im-
partial mind that no absolutely destitute person
can live for one week on one week’s rations as
supplied by any of the first four societies, and that
to their reliefers “ overlapping ” is dreadful! , ne-
cessary.
* * * *
The amount of relief supplied is insuffiei-el-
and the manner of distributing it is heartbreaking.
The Charity Organisation Society, being a private
affair, exists solely for the benefit of deserviruj
cases which come under the notice of its subscribers,
and would not have been mentioned here but for
the fact that it has taken public action agiinst
the overlapper, when, by its parsimony, it helps to
create that noxious character. Its dole of seven
loaves of bread, without meat, potatoes, or any-
thing else, even when washed down by the tea it
supplies, is hopelessly insufficient to last three
people seven days. And when the bread is con-
sumed before the time has elapsed, the C.O.
Society solemnly shakes its head at further re-
quests. And if the wretched reliefer goes else-
where that week he is overlapping.
* * * *
A day or so after application, the City Mission
will send someone to investigate. If the reliefer
dwells in a decent street and wears a white
collar and neat clothes, the Mission may be ex-
pected to be profoundly suspicious, and to talk
about Derrink and pretensions, and to ask the
reliefer if he has Jesus in his heart, and if he
hungers after the Kingdom of Heaven. But if
the reliefer hibernates in a dirty hovel in a smell-
ful lane, shows a grimy skin through his rent
bags, and owns a Woe-Woman who can make the
water trickle off her nose, the Mission is pretty
sure to weep in company and spread itself
benignantly.
* * * *
The awful Sydney Rescue Work Society ex-
tracts a subsidy from N.S.W. Govt. My experi-
ence is that it keeps applicants, even when sent
by subscribers, waiting all day, and tells them to
call again next day, and chokes them off by wear-
ing out their power to endure hunger. When it
does give relief it talks glibly of overlapping, and,
a week later (my experience again), it sends some-
body to interview the landlady. Which is more
than likely to cause that person to promptly eject
the reliefer and family as people whose credit has
gone for ever. And thereby the R. W.S. turns its
totally inadequate relief into a curse and a cause
of greater misery. Also, it thoroughly scares that
reliefer from ever calling again.
• * » *
To obtain assistance from the Benevolent
Society it is necessary to get a recommendation
from a clergyman. Armed with this, what the
Society calls one week’s rations can be obtained at
once. When the second supply is needed, the re-
liefer must wait for hours among a poverty-stricken
crowd of hopeless men, unsexed women, and half-
naked, ill-fed children to see the committee. The
interview with the committee is followed by a
domiciliary visit from an inspector, who possibly
(iny experience again) lets the whole terrace know
the nature of his business.
* * * *
Writer appealed to the Salvation Army for
assistance with food and rent, offering to do work
in return. The officer asked what prospects he
had. When he heard them he said the reliefer
had no prospects, and as the officer could see no
hope of him ever getting csut of the mud, the Army
could do nothing for him. Perhaps the Benevo-
lent Society might help him. Then he went off
to wallop his fiend.
I ,* * *
An application to the head office of the St. Vin-
cent do Paul Society drew the polite reply that
the offico had nothing to do with the granting of
relief, and did not know why the devil P e( ?Py?
came there. Also, it did not remember, and had

Since its organisation, The Mutual Life has paid
in bonuses and surrender values to its policy-holders
<£44,445,244, which is more than twice the amount
paid for similar items by the next largest company.
Observe, then, what a magnificent surplus The
Mutual could have exhibited to-day, had an
illiberal policy been pursued in relation to the
assured —a surplus exceeding that of any other
office by more than 150 per cent. But, fortunately,
the Company preferred to sacrifice a mere useless
and vainglorious display to the solid interests of
the policy-holders. Who shall say that, in taking
thiscourse, the Mutual Liee of New Yoke has
not chosen the better part? and that, in so doing,
it has not well earned the high reputation which
it has attained in every part of the world as “ the
Policy-holders’ C 0.,”“ the Co. which does the most
good ? ” The intelligent reader will not allow him-
self to be misled by the parading of sums of no
use to the present generation, and in excess of
any possible needs of the generations to come.*

CYCLES
(Fitted witb. Dunlop Tyres).
In connection with these easy-running machines, we have just issued a daintily
got-up brochure, fully illustrated, entitled “ Cycling for Ladies,” containing some
very useful hints for beginners, and for those who are anxious to look as smart
as possible when wheeling. A really good hint given and received at the right
time often decides the all-important question of whether a lady looks awkward or
elegant when cycling. For those interested in cycling from the racing standpoint,
we have also issued a little souvenir booklet, containing an account of the dis-
tinguished
ram

rider, C. F. Barden, whose appearance ALONE on the scratch mark of the Austral
Wheel Race made the Swift the cynosure of all eyes. This Xmas season we are
sending to all our old customers an entertaining Xmas story, entitled “ Xmas in
Australia,” illustrated by our own special artist. Should any of these esteemed
patrons be accidentally omitted from our list—which is a very long one a post-
card to any of our depots will command instant attention.

“ SURPLUS.”
The term “ surplus ” is applied, in life insurance
affairs, to the balance, ascertained periodically,
between the assets and the liabilities. Out of this
balance or surplus, distributions of profits are
made to the policy-holders entitled to participate.
The natural tendency of distribution is to diminish
the surplus for the moment; but in the case of a
prosperous company, the decrease is speedily more
than covered by accessions of profit from various
sources. It is clear, however, that the more
liberal the periodical distributions of profits, the
more gradual will be the growth of the surplus.
Conversely, if a life insurance company withho'ds
from its policy-holders the full benefit of the pro-
portion cf profits immediately available, and
prefers to accumulate in the interest of future
participants, it follows that the surplus will in-
crease more rapidly in proportion. Of course it
is easy to keep in hand more than the future will
require under any possible circumstances ; and,
when that course is followed, injustice to present
participants is inevitable.
Now, The Mutual Life of New Yoke, while
careful to make abundant reserves for future
bonuses, has always been equally careful to dis-
tribute to its policy-holders the full immediate
benefits which they are entitled to claim. The
Company has never sacrificed the interests of
policy-holders entitled to immediate participation,
to the formation of an imposing but empirical
surplus, never likely to be required even in the
remotest future. The surplus shown by The
Mutual Life at the end of 1896 was <£6,105,444.
It is a steadily increasing surplus, which, need-
less to say, is more than ample for all the
demands for which it has been created.
But, supposing the Company had, throughout
its history, acted on the principle which
has been adopted in, at least, one prominent
instance—of reserving a large proportion of the
surplus at every distribution, and, in addition,
reducing the surrender-values allowed for discon-
tinued policies, what does the reader suppose
would have been the amount of The Mutual’s
surplus in 1896 ? Not six millions, but upwards of
%4 millions sterling ! This is not guesswork. The
figures are based upon the official report issued by
the Insurance Department of the State of New
York, which gives annually the exact record of
every company doing business in that State.

Scientific Examination of “ALOK.”
Dr. Helms, M.A., F.C.S., Consulting and Analytical Chemist,
•m- - TnTTTO 8 Bridge-street, Sydney, Feb. 1, 1898.
Messrs. FISHER & CO., 337 George-street.
, Gentlemen, —I have examined your preparation Mighty “ALOK,” and find that it contains,
besides Kola Nut, only pure vegetable drugs having well-known tonic properties.—Yours faithfully,
A. HELMS.
Mr. J. L. Jacobsen, Champion Chess Player of Australasia, forwards unsolicited the following
testimonial, which speaks for itself :
•p. 28 Bossley-terrace, Lower Domain, Sydney, Jan. 10, 1898.
Dear Sirs,—As a cure for brain weariness and lassitude I have proved “ ALOK ” a marvellous
tome. A dose before commencing enables me to endure the arduous strain of match-play with little
tatigue. I consider it a boon to brain-workers, and heartily recommend it to all chess-players.—
Yours faithfully, J. L. JACOBSEN.

(gentlemen,—lt is with much pleasure that I testify to the merits of your Kola Nut Tonic. In my
professional vocation I am very often tired and fatigued after long and worrying rehearsals, and I find
great benefit at the time from a dose of your Kola Nut Tonic with a little sodawater. It invariably
has a most reviving effect, and I have got quite fond of it.—Yours faithfully, H. BRACY.

FISHER & CO’S
Pil-Kola
(Registered),
Fisher & Co’s Tonic in Solid Form.
These Pills contain all the properties of the
famous KOLA NUT TONIC in a solid form.
The principal ingredient of these Pills is the
famous Kola Nut, to which are added valuable
medicines, which make them an invaluable remedy
for all diseases arising from Weak Nerves, Muscu-
lar Weakness, Loss of Appetite, Depression of
Spirits, Constipation, Palpitation of the Heart,
Bad Circulation, Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Flatu-
lence, Nervous Headache, Loss of Memory, En-
largement of the Liver, Kidney Diseases, Loss of
Nerve Power and Youthful Vigor, Locomotor
Ataxy, Partial Paralysis, Sciatica, Rheumatism,
Neuralgia, and Seasickness.
DIRECTIONS—One Pill three times a day
half-an-hour before taking food. Children half a
pill. For INDIGESTION, FLATULENCY
GASTRIC TROUBLES, or CONSTIPATION)
it is better to take them after food. PRICE
-’s. 6d. PER BOX, POSTAGE FREE.
It is not claimed for Pil-Kola that it can do
what Physicians and Hospitals cannot do. Physi-
cians and Hospitals are the people and places for
those to go who wish to be cured of disease, and
the man or men who imply otherwise are frauds
and imposters, not fit to take an honorable place
in society or in the commercial community. It is
not claimed for Pil-Kola that it can make the
dead speak or repair broken limbs. Pil-Kola will
not do sensational wonders and impossibilities,
but it is claimed for Pil-Kola that it consists of
the finest Pills ever placed on the market to cure
Indigestion, cleanse and revive the Liver, clear
the Brain, and sustain and invigorate the Human
Economy. It is a wonderful Pick-me-up, and. a
splendid preparation for Strengthening the Nerves
and Heart.
Cyclists, Singers, Auctioneers, and Public
Speakers swear by it.
These Pills are beautiful and pearly, and plea-
sant to take. No pink die is used, which irritates
the stomach, and does more harm than enough.
One Pill taken three times a day will keep the
system in thorough order, giving tone to the body
and beauty to the face.
One great advantage of Pil-Kola is that it can
be posted free to 6very part of the world, and
another advantage is that the box can be carried
in the pocket and the Pills taken regularly as
recommended.
PIL-KOLA cures Indigestion and makes you
eat. A splendid preparation for strengthening
the Nerves and Heart. PIL-KOLA revives the
Liver and Brain, and restores vigor.

K Is Pleasant, Cooling, Soothing, Health-Giving, Refreshing and Invigorating.
YOU CANNOT OVERSTATE ITS CREAT VALUE IN KEEPING THE BLOOD PURE AND FREE FROM DISEASE.
u AS an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO S FRUIT
SALT * I have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO’S * FRUIT SALT ’ he now ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH ; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it, about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.—I remain, yours faith-
fully, J. W. Neil.” ( From the late Rev. J. W. Neil, Holy Trinity Church, North Shields.)
HEADACHE and Disordered Stomach.— “ After suffering for nearly
n two and a half years from SEVERE HEADACHE and DISORDERED
STOMACH, and after trying almost everything, and spending much money, with-
out finding any benefit, I was recommended by a friend to try ENO’S ‘ FRUIT
SALT ’ and before I had finished one bottle I found it doing me a GREAT DEAL
of GOOD, and now I am RESTORED to MY USUAL HEALTH; and others I
know that have tried it have NOT ENJOYED such GOOD HEALTH for years.
—-Yours most truly, Robert Humphreys, Post Office, Barrasford."
The effect of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT* on any DISORDERED and FEVERISH
condition is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE’S OWN REMEDY
and an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION —Examine each Bottle, and see CAPSULE is marked ENO'S 'FRUIT SALT.'
Without it, you have been imposed on by a WOR THLESS imitation . Prepared only by

POLITICAL
POINTS
Queensland’s motto : “ Australia for the
Austr-aliens.”
Only one Australian Premier—Turner—
graduated through a borough council. And that’s
mainly what’s the matter with Turner.
Among British dependencies, Cape Colony,
S. Australia, Westralia, Tasmania, and Victoria
possess elective Upper Houses of Parliament.
F. B. Suttor, Parliamentary candidate for
Bathurst, has held office, putting one term with
another, longer thaD any other living N.S.W.
politician.
One N.S. Wales M.P. has appointed at
least two agents in his electorate whose business
will be to collect voters’ electoral rights and safe-
keep the documents “ till they are wanted."
Salmon, the renegade Labor man, who
polled 60 votes against Hutchison’s 1002 at East
Adelaide last month, told the electors at the
declaration of the poll that he had received 800
promises of support.
" A HEALTHY SION.”
The Philo-Chineses have been pointing
out that the number of Chinamen in Victoria is
only about half what it has been. No matter.
But for the embargo there would be about two
million Chinese in Australia now.
Somebody writes from Brisbane : “ Why
bo constantly abuse our Ministers ? They are not
bad fellows. Indeed, you would have to go far
to find better.” That’s a fact. The Gang con-
sists of good fellows. Affable Brigands.
“ Tom ” Slattery, in search of friendly
suggestions as to the best way of compassing a
majority at the next King election, was treated
by a shrewd wire-puller to the really valuable
piece of advice : “ Keep your mouth shut as much
as you can.”
What has most commended itself to
Glassey, the Queensland Labor leader, during his
touring round Australia, is the S.A. system of
State advances to selectors and farmers. Also,
Glassey gave the suburban “homestead blocks
idea his most approving smiles.
N.S.W. State Children’s Relief Board had
2809 waifs under its care in 1894, and, by 1897, the
number had increased to 3671. In the three Pro-
tectionist years (1892-3-4), the department’s stock
of child paupers increased by 440; in the three
jolly-and-fat years (1895-6-7) they increased by
862. More “ decrease of poverty ” !
N.S.W. M.P. Waddell, who is a fearfully-
nervous patriot, is forsaking his old love, Cobar,
for that constituency of carriers, Cowra. Every
second man in Cowra is a carrier, and the only
way to woo them is with promises of unlimited
roads and bridges, but, when once captured, the
man they vote solidly for is a certainty.
It is now stated by opponents of the
Ministry in S.A. that Irish and Catholic appli-
cants receive a preference over other customers of
the Crown Lands office. A delicate way of call-
ing attention to the fact that both Kingston’s Land
Ministers (Gillen, who is dead, and O’Loughlin)
have been loyal Hibernians and good Romanists.
A recent telegram from Wentworth (N.S.
Wales) announced that the Darling was unpre-
cedentedly low, but a great body of water was
expected down from Queensland, heavy rains
having fallen there. This was the same week that
Premier Reid was raising his historical howl:
“ Every drop of water in the Darling belongs to
N.S.W.”
Tomjoe Byrnes is reported to have said
to a crony on the way out, in an elevated moment,
that he was going to be the biggest man in Aus-
tralia. Whence probably the intelligence cabled
all over Australia that Mr. Byrnes has taken the
Govt, sea-going steamer Lucinda, and sailed away
for several days to think hard. The schemes which
crowd his brain are so enormous that it takes a
whole ship to hold that single swelled head !
Once more—in the matter of his demands
from China—J. Bull backs down the ladder, rung
by rung. It is always Bull’s policy to bite off
more than he can chew, so that when compelled
to disgorge a portion he still retains as much as
he really wanted. Under cover of that demand
for the opening of Talienwan, Salisbury will pro-
bably get through with most of his other proposals
—and thus drive the wedge of British influence
into the heart of China.
Q. Labor M.L.A. Dawson’s admiration for
Attorney-General Tomjoe Byrnes seems to border
on the idolatrous. In Dawson’s oft-expressed
opinion, Byrnes is the greatest public man extant
on this planet. Cynics say that the large R.C.
vote in the Towers and Byrnes’s suaviter in modo
have much to do with the apparent subjection of
the Laborite ; but, anyhovv, Tomjoe was crafty
enough to keep right with Dawson —the really
strong man of the Labor-party—while Tozer was
fooling away his time with Glassey.
Westralian Forrest’s howl on behalf of the
cheap Chow (Argus report)
Exclusiveness would never make us a great nation. This
was the secret of the glory of the old mother country,
whose proud boast it was that all nations, white, black,
brown, and yellow, owed her sovereignty.
What rot! Britain’s fatal maxims constitute her
sovereignty over some colored races. Forrest’s
maxims (equally fatal) would give colored races
the sovereignty over Australia. Federated Aus-
tralia will promptly count Forrest out.
The Westralian Ministry, in an unwonted
burst of Liberalism, proposes introducing a bill
giving working men facilities for going on the
land at a minimum price of £2 per acre. Two
pounds an acre—and nearly ail the land the
Government has to offer near any of the centres
of population consists of sand and Sahara. So
much good country was given away during the
early days in big grants to reward the enterprise
of the man who imported a cheap German piano
or a third-rate stallion, and so much more went
to land-grant railway shindykits and was scat-
tered in jobs like the Hampton Plains swindle,
that there is very little accessible dust left now
at 40s. an acre.
Robert Stout is retiring fromM.L. politics
on the ground that he feels it necessary to spend
the rest of his life hustling for a living. So,
apparently, the intrigue for making him Premier
in place of Seddon is off. Stout entered politics
27 years ago ; he certainly can’t have made much
out of them, and he has never quite got over the
crash with which the country threw out himself
and his Ministry in ’B7. Lver since then he has
waited for Maoriland to call on him, as the only
genuine Liberal, to come and save it, but Maori-
land hasn’t called. This is his third retirement
from public life, so probably he means now to let
the beastly country go to wreck for want of him
till it realises his real value. But, when the coun-
try does want to be saved, a good loud call will
awake Robert Stout at any moment. If the coun-
try rings him up on the telephone in the dead of
night, The Bulletin is willing to bet that Stout
will rush into his clothes in less than three
minutes and get downstairs to assume the reins of
Government.
The proposal of the Federal finance com-
mittee to have a system of account-keeping be-
tween the States for five years, and then let the
Commonwealth Parliament, with five years’ ex-
perience to-gnide it, fix up a definite and more or
less permanent scheme, is probably the best thing
that maligned body could have suggested. If the
50 Conventionists won’t agree to lump together
the railways, debts, military, naval and education
systems, rivers, customs, and excise, without
Valuation, and they absolutely insist on soulless
accuracy, there is hardly anything else that the
committee could suggest. Until it knows what
results a uniform tariff will produce there are no
facts to go upon. The wild howl of Lyne and
others is that they want to start with a definite
and permanent system, but no one can make a
definite system till he has something to make it
out of. Five years of a uniform tariff will supply
some data to go upon, and any system which
could be definitely established now would probably
want to be remodelled five years hence in any
case.
AN OBVIOUS INFERENCE.
YOUNG STRINGYBARK (seeing wheelbarrow for the first time at maintenance-man's camp): “By
gum, pap, that 'ere dray’s got a PUP!”
John Forrest (W.A.) to Higgins (Vic.) :
“ I’m as good a Liberal as you, but. I’m not your
sort of Liberal. I’m the sort of Liberal that wants
every man to be left in possession of his own pro-
perty. I don’t want to take what any man has
away from him.” And big, blatant John’s Govt,
has just taken away from several thousand pro-
spectors the right which they formerly possessed
to look for alluvial gold below 10ft.—which right
was pretty nearly the only asset the poor dry-
blower possessed.
NONE IN THE MARKET.
JUST-APPOINTED JAYPEE (who will have his little joke):
“ That’s a good moke, Father —too good for a priest.
Now, our Saviour used to ride an ass ?”
FATHER M'GINTY : “ That’s so, my friend; hut you see they’ve
been making magistrates of all the asses round here,
and I can’t get one for love or money.”
William the Unexpected’s affected solici-
tude for the German missionaries in China
becomes all the more ridiculous when it is remem-
bered that the outraged missionaries were Jesuits,
and that Jesuits, by| existing German law, must
not set foot upon German soil.
“A Sydney Freetrade M.P. has just ex-
plained his financial position to me. His 3| years
in Parliament have, between official pay and
‘pickings,’ realised something over .61000. Two
elections have cost him £l5O, and the first sum of
£9O was a fairly big premium to pay for the mere
chance of a year’s work (the duration of last Par-
liament). Subscriptions of various kinds run
away with £2 a week, so that his real remunera-
tion totals about .£4. But, then, he has fixed a
fascinated eye upon the Public Works Com-
mittee.”—T.D.
A general election looms, and now is the
time for cheap “copy” from N.S. Wales M’sP.
Mr. Blank’s MS., having been thrown out of
several Sydney offices, is nowon its way round the
suburbs and through the country. The articles of
that modest person generally begin : “ We heartily
endorse the opinions of Mr. Blank. It is men like
Mr. Blank the country languishes for, men of
capacity and proved political probity.” In his
accompanying note he tells the editor : “You can
make a leader of it, if you like ; in fact, I prefer
that; but, anyway, give it a decent position and
lead it.”
Once more N.S.W. Speaker Abbott will
have to fight for his Wentworth seat. Twice
before the Labor-party has run an opponent. This
time the homestead lessees and selectors, who
have lately, formed a league, put forward a man.
But as he’s the twice-defeated nominee of the
Labor-party, and got 117 fewer votes last election
than at the one before, and as Wentworth squat-
tages are-still large, and back-fences still require
repairing at election times, the result will pro-
bably be all the same.
The year 1800 witnessed in
N.S. Wales exactly the same fiscal
controversy which rages now on
the verge of 1900. It is a very
old controversy. At that time
the Govt, found that, in addition
to 1 inchgut and Cockatoo, a gaol
on the Sydney side of the Cove
was needed, and it was deter-
mined to raise the cost of con-
struction by direct taxation. The
taxation amounted to a combined
property and income tax, but
then, just as now, several resi-
dents possessed neither property
nor get atable income, so a cry
went up that the impost was
class taxation and should be re-
probated by an intelligent people.
Orators of the time argued that
the Government was penalising
thrift, just as they do now. Num-
bers of wealthy citizens point
blank refused to pay, and one
day the masons were knocked off
through want of funds. Then
came Customs taxation for the
first time in Australian history.
Everybody ate and drank, and
Govt, distributed the balance of
the cost of building the gaol over
the principal consumable imports.
H.: “When Parke
the name Commonwealth for the
proposed Federation, I seized on
it as the best for Australia, fitting
every stage, from the grub or
chrysalis of subjection to the
butterfly of liberty and independ-
ence. For two reasons it is better
than Republic. Firstly, Parkes
chose it in his admiration of
Cromwell and the most glorious
flash in English history. No other
Power of the first order has ever
borne thenarneof Commonwealth.
Secondly, the word has all the
meaning of Republic, but carries
further. The great republics of
history, not forgetting America
and France, have been far too
'aristocratic in texture to satisfy
a thorough-going philosopher. It is not enough
merely to knock off the monarch and court. Com-
monwealth implies socialism.”
One great difficulty at the Federal Con-
vention is the demand of Westralia for some kind
of special guarantee. Westralia has a much bigger
Customs revenue per head than any other pro-
vince, and it wants to be assured that its extra
contribution will be spent in Westralia. Mean-
while Kalgoorlie, which supplies a far bigger
proportion of said revenue than any other part of
Westralia, wants a similar guarantee about its
own contribution, but the money it contributes
keeps on being fooled away in Forrest’s electorate
of Banbury just the same. Circumstances alter
cases a good deal; in fact, circumstances frequently
bash cases beyond all human recognition.
“ Strange stories are creeping back from
the Afridis’ country,” writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, “of the bashful diffidence
of the British boy-soldier to be formally intro-
duced to his foemen. Officers shot down a score
of yards in front of their men, who would not sup-
port them ; fatal waverings only checked by the
order to, retreat, and one or two helter-skelter
‘ charges ’ to protect the rear, have been worrying
the war authorities in file and battalion. Boys,
whose development into men has been checked by
disease, thanks to the fools who know not India,
are not likely to be without a weak spot: and how
would European artillery-fire find it put! ”
For the several-billionth time the Sydney
Telegraph rose up last week to point out that a
man couldn’t be at once a Protectionist and a true
Federationist. Somehow Protection and Federa-
tion go together all right in the United States,
Switzerland and Mexico; also in Austria and
Germany, which may be fairly classed as federated
states. And there isn’t one Federation which is
run on Freetrade principles with its ports open
to all the world. Still the imported-calico organ
keeps on saying that Protection and Federation
can’t go together, and if they really can’t go
together then tbe fact that they do go together
is probably an optical illusion arising through
drink.
N. : “ About the British army, as it was
and is. A fact that will give an idea of its power
rather more than 55 years ago, although Welling-
ton and Lyndhurst used to declaim on its weak-
ness : Louis Philippe made the Paris fortifications
in fear of an invasion, not by Germany, but by
Britain ! Imagine such a thing, for such a
reason, being done now. Even before the first
French Revolution, the fortifications had been
levelled, as a relic of barbarism, and Napoleon
never attempted to revive them as permanent
works. The backbone of the British army was
broken in the Crimea, when we went to war to fix
Napoleon 111. on the throne, and put down Repub-
licanism, but failed to do it.”

Ed. Bulletin, —When the N.S.W. de-
tachment of Mounted Rifles left Camden for
England, they were told they would be paid for
all parades of their respective companies during
them absence, but so far it is “nix,” and they’d
like to know why.— Eyes Front.
Marriage. N.S.W. police-sergeant Chas.
M‘Hardy, champion heavy-weight artist, to Miss
Nash, heroine of the breach-of-promise case at
last Wyalong District Court. Miss Nash re-
covered JEIOO damages from defendant, although
the jury nearly all belonged to the same secret
society as the promise-breaker. The case was a
mere breach-of-contract affair. No reputations
were scraped—the lady’s was admittedly unassail-
able—and no broken hearts were exhibited. De-
fendant gave “difference of religion” as his ex-
cuse, but as it had taken him about six years to
find this out the jury cast him in damages.
The slaughter of officers in the desperate
Indian frontier fighting has been great enough to
satisfy even the sailor who was caught praying,
before an engagement, that the enemy’s shot
might be distributed like the prize-money—“ the
Greatest part amongst the officers! ” The little
hinkamar “ affair ” just cabled cost the lives of
the colonel commanding and four lieutenants—
and three out of the four belonged to a regiment
which lost only eight rank-and-file.
The S.A. Federal delegates, it is alleged,
are half-inclined to revolt even at the last moment
against placing the posts and telegraphs under
Federal control. This is intended as a special
kick at N.S.W.—in fact, the Third Convention
has, so far, been one long-continued kick between
these two provinces. Some of the ten Crow-
eaters want to point out that N.S.W. won’t
federate the debts because hers is smaller than
S.A.’s, or the rivers because she has more water,
or the interest bills because she pays a shade
less per shent, or the railways because she reckons
it would draw trade from Sydney to Adelaide.
And in return for all this they want to know why
S.A. should amalgamate her postal department,
yielding a profit of-660,000 a year, with the insol-
vent Joe Cook department of N.S.W.

The trail of the convict-lash is still over

an alias upon a policeman is apt to pay for it, as a

newly-arrived t’othersiders.
The S.M. Herald is a cautious old bird,
and determined to have no libels of the Kelly-
j)AlLY Telegraph sort. So it headed its recent
detective-shooting report “ Encounter with
p o i ice ,” instead of “ Encounter with Burglars ”or
<« Alleged Burglars.” Sydney Truth irreverently
wonders why the Herald didn’t say “Alleged
Encounter With a Supposed Cart.”
The perpetrators of a recent Sydney
suburban burglary are obviously high up in the
profession. After mysteriously nobbling a
ferocious dog they treated themselves liberally to
whisky in the dining-room, entered a room m
vo women were in bed, calmly removed a
of glassware to get at the silver-plate they
were after, and carried off the swag in a vehicle
belonging to the premises.
Gov. Brassey turned up to a recent Vic.
executive meeting, the other day, and found but
one Inem |^ r awaiting him. As it takes two for a
Quorum, Uncle Tom had to sit and wait with the
other man for the third•_ to turn up, and, after an

into the tub of water, died suddenly a few days
back, aged 63. He was an extremely conscien-
tious man, and the denouement troubled him ex-
ceedingly.

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
THAT FLY.
Who won the match ?
“ I,” said the fly
In MacLaren's eye—
“ I won the match."
Australian triumphal psalm, apropot fourth
test-match
I to C. Hill will lift mine hat
From whence doth come my aid.
* * * i •
Britishah : “ The fourth test-match didn’t com-
pel me to ‘eat my words’ re the dulness of Australian
batting- in general, but it has moved me to admit that the
Englishmen s attempt to play a steady game was absurdly
feeble. They seemed unlucky in losing the toss for the
third time, but, in this instance, their opponents were
disposed of pretty cheaply, and, the wicket being good,
they started their first innings with an encouraging pros-
pect before them. The effort was a failure, and a slow,
all-round failure, to beat the bowling. Seven of them
managed to make from 17 to 30 runs apiece. Their bat-
ting didn t collapse, they merely petered out with care.
The follovv-on gave them another chance to save the game,
and this time they had the plucky example of little Briggs
to urge them to play up. Briggs is a very second-rate
batsman nowadays, yet he showed his mates how
to make 44 runs for once “ out ” under the
disadvantage of two breaks in his period at the
wickets. He carried his bat for 21, went in again
after the interval, kept his stumps up for 20 minutes in
a shocking bad light, and, resuming his innings next
day, added a useful 20 runs. The example was thrown
away upon the ‘cracks’ who succeeded him, and the
result of a whole day’s batting was 240 runs for six
wickets—highest individual score 55, lowest 16. This
performance looks contemptible on paper, but not so con-
temptible as it appeared to the audience around the oval.
Mr. Dick Teeee, a trustee of Sydney Cricket Ground, said
lately: ‘ The English team is the strongest batting side
we have ever seen here. The chief point of difference
between their batting and ours is that they are aggressive,
while we are defensive.’ A less aggressive lot of batsmen
than the ‘ cracks ’ who played a losing game at the rate of
50 runs per hour couldn't be imagined. Figures show
that none of the Australian bowlers were in marvel-
lous form, but the batting made all six of them look
difficult at one time or other. If the visitors played
cautiously at the instigation of Stoddart their day's
record should warn Majah Wardill and his co-promoters
not to give old friend Stoddy another order for an
‘attractive’ English eleven. Speaking as a Britishah,
with a black and bitter hatred for what is called patient
batting, I will say that nothing could have been more
unsatisfactory than the Englishmen’s defeat—except
their victory, which might have happened if rain had
come to their aid. I could respect them for rushing to
their doom, on the ‘all is lost, save honor’ principle.
Stoddart and co., in Melbourne, were as moribund
cricketers playing their own funeral march.”
» • * *
Batiji s remarks on the test-matches grow very
tiresome. Interviewed after the fourth match, the fallen
idol said : “Really, you know, the victory is absolutely
due to Hill,” whereas the final discomfiture of the losers
was due to the fact that they couldn’t get more than two
wickets for 115 runs in the Australian second innings, not-
withstanding Hill’s dismissal for a “duck.” Again the
unreasoning Ranji said, “ Stoddart played on, and so did
I, while Wainwright got out in the daVk.” The sugges-
tion that Stoddart and Wainwright might probably have
knocked up big scores is absurd. The Yorkshireman’s
batting has been a failure throughout the tour—he is
only just beginning to find form ; and, as for Stoddart,
he was lucky in not getting out sooner than he did.’
His form at the wickets was undoubtedly a nerveless
display of puerile pottering.
Johnny Briggs, who cheerfully admits the
truth about Australian bowling and batting, feels rather
sore upon the toss question. Johnny thinks that “ the
visiting team as a matter of courtesy might be given the
choice of innings, and after that it might go alternately.”
But why not toss for the choice of three out of five on the
alternate system, instead of ensuring a considerable
advantage to the visitors?
None of the oracles has yet attempted to
explain why the average Australian amateur bowler is a
much better batsman than the average English pro-
fessional bowler. The number of professional experts in
both departments visiting Australia during the past
fifteen years can be counted on the fingers of one hand—
Ulyett, Barnes, Lohmann, Peel, Hayward, Attewell, and
Briggs certainly rank as bowlers and batsmen, but not
much of the latter in comparison with George Palmer
Midwinter, Gilfen, Harry Trott, Albert Trott, Turner (a
dashing bat on occasions), Trumble, Charlie M‘Leod, and
Noble. Says Briggs : “ Your bowlers, who are used all
their lives to these (hard and true) wickets, have learnt
the art of making the ball break.” But he forgets to add
that they have also, in almost every instance, learned to
bat much better than Richardson, Hearne, Sharp, Hold
Peate, Humphrey, chucker Crossland, and a dozen other
important English bowlers who have figured in county
matches with Australian visiting teams.
Druce has now the barren honor of being the
only batsman to score double figures every time in the
test matches.
There’s a lot of discussion “ through the neck ”
concerning the rival merits of Australian and English
scores this season. More than two-thirds of the Austra-
lian wickets in 11-a-side matches have been taken by
Richardson and Hearne at an average cost of 28£ runs-e-
-66 wickets for 1878 runs. Briggs, Hirst, Havward, Waif-
wright and Mason have yielded an average of 57 runs Jbr
23 wickets. On the other hand, Noble, Jones i*nd
Trumble have taken 63 English wickets altogether at a
cost of 25 runs per wicket, whilst M'Kibbin, Trott,
Howell and M‘Leod have a total of 44 wickets for 32 runs
apiece. Australian batting versus English ditto must be
considered in the light of these bowling figures.
If they get a dry wicket for the final test-
match the scoring should be fast on both sides. The
Englishmen have discovered that they can't do any good
by batting cautiously with the idea of tiring the bowlers,
for there are too many bowlers to tire. And the Austra-
lians will surely play a bold, forcing game this time.
* * * *
An old fellow of 71 walked a long journey to
Melbourne, last Monday week, to see the test-match.
Seemingly, he fell exhausted into the Moonee Ponds
Creek, where he was found in a dying state. Babbling of
cricket the luckless ancient was taken to Melb. Hospital
and the nurses brought him bulletins of the game until
he at last died unconscious. Probably he would have re-
covered if the Englishmen had been getting the best of
it. Old and impecunious cricket enthusiasts in this
country are very Hinglish, as a rule, and the rising
generation gets a lot of good fun from hearing them
snort at the triumphant inferiority of beastly “colonial”
play.
* * * *
What’s wrong with pitting an all-Australian
second eleven against the Englishmen ? M'Kibben, Bruce
Worrall, M'Kenzie, and Graham have all been playing
first-class cricket this season, and, by giving a chance to
say, Wanliss (of Ballarat) and Donahoo (of Brisbane), the
result should be a team capable of doing more than Stod-
dart and co. have done during the last three test-matches.
* * * •
Dear B.—A boy switch-attendant in N.S.W,
Telephone Bureau lost his head over last cricket match
so far as to ring-up a Sydney newspaper office for the
score, whereupon he was reported and fined ss. Now
don’t you think Australian patriotism should present
that boy with his ss. and a new bat?—J.F.D.
* * * •
S. A. Cricketing Association got 20 per cent, of
the gross receipts from the Adelaide test-match, or a con-
tribution of £4OO. Each English pro. receives £3OO net
for the tour, but Heaven and Ben Wardill only know how
much the amateurs draw for drinks and other expenses.
It is estimated that the trip will cost the promoters
£12,000, and what they (ret over that will mean profit.
• * * *
Appropriate music by the band at the late test-
match. When that Hy was blocking MacLaren, the tune
was “That's the time to catch ’em.” When Katiji went
in, they struek-up “ The dandy-colored coon ” ; hut they
didn’t play “After the ball,” when Hill was giving the
Britons a treat.
• • * •
The latest Melb. catch. “ The English cricket-
ing people don’t intend sending another eleven out here.”
“ Oh, nonsense,” nine out of ten will retort. “ It’s quite
true, nevertheless; they’ll have to send out a twenty-
two I ”
• * * *
Iredale seems r quite off, 13 being his highest
score for his past four innings. Mackenzies 130, for
N.S.W. against the Englishmen, by brilliant cricket, fol-
lowing on his consistent scoring during the season, must
make his claim very strong for a place in the final test-
match ; and the general opinion is that Iredale should
stand down for him. Iredale, unfortunately, is on the
selection committee, and, as there is a strong doubt as to
his claim for a place, he would do well, should he desire
to play, to follow Garrett’s footsteps, and allow someone
else to take his place on the committee. The active
player who is on a selection committee occupies a false
position.
Out of the 191 runs made whilst Mackenzie was
at the wickets, he placed 130 against his name, scoring
for some time at the rate of a run a minute. Howell
even beat Mackenzie for a gallery-innings, making 48
runs in 44min. In one over, off Stoddart, he hit three balls
to the asphalt, and then lifted one clean out of the ground
into the lawn-tennis enclosure.
Syd. Gregory did not show his usual versatility
of strokes, confining his play to the slips, where no less
than four fieldsmen were stationed ; but even then he
managed to place an occasional one between them. Had
the English captain put a man out near the cycle-track lie
would have saved runs by returning the balls that got
past the fieldsmen. The responsibility of captainship
appeared to weigh heavily upon Gregory, who, for him,
played a very cramped game.
* * * *
A. C. K. M’Kenzie, the N.S.W. batsman who
distinguished himself last Saturday by knocking 130 runs
off the English bowling, is a very large cornstalk, 6ft. 3in.
high and weighing about 14£st. In making this score, he
played a willing game ; being a hard-hitter, it is deplor-
able that he should have the Australian tendency to
potter ; a man who can lift a ball on to the roof of’ the
Sydney Cricket Ground refreshment bar, smashing one of
the tiles, does not look well poking at the bowling for 15
or 20 minutes. M’Kenzie, of course, has his view of the
matter. He says that if a batsman gets a run of good-
length bowling he must play steadily to keep his wicket.
M’Kenzie began playing cricket while a very little
boy, his pal being Syd. Gregory. The two youths formed
a club of their own—the Winchester—and this club used
to play other clubs in short pants on Moore Park
and jsquabble and fight when occasion sanctioned it;
also when occasion didn’t sanction it. M’Kenzie thus
picked up his cricket as most Australian players
have done, without coach or instruction save the
casual tips that fellow players give each other.
All the same he is sufficiently developed now to say that
he would as soon face the English bowling as he would
the Victorian or South Australian. In fact, he savs the
Australians can bowl better than the Englishmen can on
our wickets. He began first-class cricket seven years ago
at the age of 20—he well remembers the young and
tender feeling that came over him when going out for his
d6but—against Melbourne. He plaj-ed football up to the
age of 15, when ne got his right arm badly broken, and
thereafter left the manly game for those with sound
limbs and unsound sense. Five years ago he started
rowing and at once fell off in batting. After 18 months
rowing he could scarcely bat at all. Mas ie then advised
him to quit rowing as “ it was rowing that spoiled me for
a batsman.” The theory is that rowing, while it
strengthens a man remarkably, stiffens his muscles and
joints ; a batsman must be elastic and limber.

Some statistics of the four test-matches :—Eng-
land scored 2109 runs; Australia, 2176 runs. Two
Englishmen made over a hundred each ; five Australians.
Throughout the matches England played 12 different
men ; Australia, 13.
England had 7 innings 3 wickets ; Australia, 5
Innings 4 wickets. That is, Australia, playing 21 wickets
less tlian England, made 67 runs more.
Of the Englishmen 42 were caught, 24 clean
bowled, 1 run out, and 4 l.b.w. Of the Australians 25
were caught, 20 clean bowled, 4 run out, and 1 l.b.w. Not
one man was stumped on either side.
The English bowlers bowled 4607 balls, 158
maidens, 6 no-balls, and 2 wides ; the Australians, 5373
balls, 234 maidens, 8 no-balls, and 9 wides. Nine different
Englishmen bowled, and eight different Australians.
Individual aggregate scores pan out thus:—
England. Australia.

Ominous. “Does Ranji bowl?” was asked at
Albany. “ Well,” said M’Laren, “he does ; but our team
will be in Queer-street if he is ever called upon to face the
bowling crease in a first-class match.” Ranji was put on
to howl in the last test, and in the last match with
N.S. Wales.
• • * *
Ranji outran jied Ranji in his last interview after
the fourth test match. He calls it “bad luck” that a
man should be standing in exactly the right spot to catch
Johnny Briggs out; that M’Laren simply poked his bat
forward and played the hall into Iredale’s hands, and that
he, as also Stoddart, “ played on.” The Injun gentleman
will not give Australian bowlers any credit; which, con-
sidering the number of times his own sticks have been
rattled during the trip, looks much like childish pique.
Poor Stoddart must wish the dark gentleman in even a
warmer spot than India.
* * * *
“ May not poor captainship be largely responsi-
ble for the English cricket defeat?” asks a Bulletin cor-
respondent. “ Stoddart’s popularity has shut out criticism
so far. Note this : When the first test-match was plaved,
MacLaren and other crack bats opened proceedings.
Ranji came in only on the downfall of Druce. He played
with the whole of the tail (Wainwright, Briggs, &c.) as his
vis-a-vis, and stayed in to the end. Result: That the
demon Jones was kept religiously off the bowling-crease
by the wily Trott, and that Richardson and Hearne
knocked up 20 or 30 apiece off the softer tack provided for
Ranji’s special benefit. Total, 551. In every match since
the two reliable bats have gone in together, and have come
out together. During their sojourn at the wickets, Jones
has confined himself to exertions at mid-on. With the
disappearance of the last of them Jones modestly
emerges, shakes his parti-colored locks before the sight-
board, and goes through the tail like rotten cheese.
Surely, when batsmen are inferior, it is part of a skilful
leader’s business to know it and to counteract it as far as
possible. Further, in the N.S.W. match just played why
were Ranji and Stoddart (two desperate changes’ resorted
to when in extremis over Mackenzie) kept going after
Mac's departure, while Hayward and Briggs were stand-
in«- idle in a wretched light and a puzzling wind? Is it
captainship, or what?
“ Test-matches are decided by a process of elim
ination of the unfit. The players succumb, one after
another, to the conditions prevalent here. With most
visiting teams, the deterioration process begins at once,
and goes on right through the tour. Stoddart’s last
team won its final victory through the efforts of six men who
had survived. This team was apparently of softer material.
Only two or—counting in Hearne as something near form
—only three men gave any indication of an approach to
traditional capacity. A backbone of professional bats,
who could stand the climate, would have given the team
the lacking'' stamina. Where were Brown and Ward and
Peel this time ? ”—H.
• • • •
Seven times consecutively has Stoddart lost the
toss in a first-class match !
* * • •
As Stoddart won’t say it, and Ranji apparently
can’t, let us have the grace of saying it for them. The
English team on its arrival did really contain nine good
hats of unusual calibre. The nine boiled down to four at
an early stage through the persistent failure of Stoddart,
Druce, Mason, and Waitiwright, and the partial failure of
Hayward. Four were left to win the critical match off
their own bats if they could, and two of the four—Storer
and Hirst—were physically incapacitated on the deciding
day. There was a desperate ineffectiveness about the efforts
ofall the team except the two who survived. They collapsed
steadily somewhere between 15 and 30. And the respon-
sibility of having to win the game between them seems to
have got on the nerves of Ranji and MacLaren, who did far
worse (taking state of wicket into account) in the fourth
match than in any previous one. Batting in a test-match
with six admitted failures as colleagues must be emin-
ently destructive of morale. No members of the team
hut these two would have been selected on “form” had
the match been played where English substitutes were
accessible.
* * * »
The most disgusted man at the Adelaide test-
match was a Syrian, or something else colored. He went
down to see Ranji bat; and when the great slim man mis-
hit and “sent her up,” the Asiatic danced in delight.
Then the crowd roared, and Ranji trotted out. “ What
for? what for?” the new expert demanded, and asserted
that Ranji had hit 'em higher than anybody. “Ah,
yes,” a kind person assured him ; “ that’s the game. Yer
see, Ranji's going to stand on his hit. He reckons none
of the rest of ’em can lick that skier.” And so comforted,
the Syrian pushed out to continue his stay-lace hawking,
confident of the supremacy of his champion.
* * * *
When this paper went to press there were high
hopes that N.S.W. was going to lick the firm of Great
Britain, Ranjitsinhji and co. off its own bat. How these
hopes pan out will probably be known by the time the pre-
sent issue sees the light. England’s first innings, 357, of
which Druce made 109, Hayward 63, Madaren 61, and
Waitiwright 50. First N.S.W. innings, 415, Mackenzie
being top scorer with 130. Second N.S.W. innings, two
down for 102, and the gay Mackenzie 52 (not out).
“Donald Mackintosh, the Australian pigeon-
pinker,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
“ left a lot of heart-burning here and on the Continent,
and scooped the pools as follows Monte Carlo, £790 ;
Nice and Cannes, £lBO ; Rome, £75 ; London, £1420 ; Spa
(Belgium), £250 ; Bosnia, £l5O ; Genoa, t5O ; Namur,
£lBO ; Baris, £125 ; Ostend, f3oo—total, > 3502. Not bad
for a two-years’ holiday. He won five times in the Inter-
national week at the Gun Club and Hurlingham, £550;
and won the challenge cup of £lOO three times in suc-
cession, killing 60 birds in 62 at 30yds.”

“In the coming racing season,” writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, “ both American and
Australian horses will be in great force on the English
courses. Merman is entered for the £2OOO Lincolnshire
handicap on March 22nd, though the distance is only a
mile, also for the £2500 Chester Cup, 2j: miles—same as
the Cesarewitch he won—in May, and the Jubilee Stake,
£3OOO, one mile, on May 7th. Merman, Maluma, and
Newhaven 11. are entered for Ascot Gold Cup, the most
coveted trophy in England, won by P. of W.’s Persimmon
in ’97, two and a half miles. Aurnni, Mrs. Langtry’s
latest Australian—at £5OOO, it is said—is not entered at
all, though W. Cooper’s Newhaven is entered freely in
spring handicaps. He is expected to see the starter in
the City and Suburban, at Epsom, on April 20th, for the
mile-and a-quarter, with H. C. White’s Form, who has
been running shockingly enough to query such an entry.
Daimio and Norton are in the Grand '{National, whilst
F.bor is being kept for two-mile lepps as stable food-finder.
Ebor picked up 150 sovs., and a little more at 9-to-4 on,”
continues the writer, “at Kempton in the Stmbury
Steeple with Hickey up, 2 miles. Six started, the next
best at 5 to 1, and five so bad that Ebor, with 2 stone
more,_ would have been favorite, anyhow. He carried
P2st. ilb., and, as three fell, or stopped, Hickey was never
headed, won by six lengths, giving a stone and over to
everything.

Precaution was the closest-watched gee-gee at
Rosehill, on Saturday, on account of her Newmarket
Handicap engagements. She certainly won the Shorts
as was confidently expected of her, but, it was only by a
nose, and her backers for the Newmarket must have felt
raiher glum. At the distance she seemed to have the
race won, hut she stopped until Giril and Antimony got
alongside her, and only just managed to get going again
in time. Her rider said he thought he had everything
beaten, and eased her down, a statement which the mare’s
running seemed to justify.

A harmless jooular leaflet, published at
sixpence for the benefit of the vie. Miners’
Benevolent Fund, suggests that mining companies
should appoint inspectors as follows:—A Laundry-
man for the “Wash”; a Botanist to look after
the Plant; a Carrier to deal with the Lode, &c.,
&c. Sixpence seems plenty to pay for two dozen
of such pun-jokes, but charity suffereth long and
is kind.
The physiology examiner for Melb. Uni-
versity, in his report on the examinations, sneers
at the papers of some of the candidates. He says
they “depicted the tongue of varying degrees of
color from bright vermilion to the most subdued
purple.” Why not V The tongue is a very chame-
leon for color. In the morning it is, in the mouths
of many highly-respectable citizens, white and
woolly. Also it is often, in the jaws of many
well-dressed persons, cracked in places like sun-
baked clay, and in color anything from dirty-grey
to burnt umber. But how should an examiner in
physiology be expected to know these things ?

Some little time ago the British naval salt-
horse men ran riot in the Chinese quarter of
Cairns (Q.) till the valiant men of Joss came out
in force and hunted them away. A Cairns press-
man concocts the yarn that a bill of .£125 for
breakages has since been sent in, with this letter :
Misser Captain—What for you send him sala man along
my fellow-countryman shop, smash em window, steal era
hat, blake em door. What for your sala man blake em
window : window no lun away. My countlyman want
blake em gala man : sala man lun away. Window more
better sala man. I get your countlyman makem bill
longa you. Suppose you no pay him, me telle your
llissie Queen. She no pay, me tell em my Emperor. You
look out! Suppose she no pay him bill God Save em
Queen no more. No more Chinaman callem Queen good
fellow. Good-bye, Misser Captain ; hope you no catchee
seasick.”
“Miles ” to The Bulletin :
Directl.y war is declared, the cables are cut, and never
spliced again, so long as there is war. Superfluous to
enlarge on the facility of cutting, whether landward or
seaward. As for the mending—well, it would never he
thought of, if worth the foe’s while to prevent. Nehe-
miah’s troops might lay bricks at Jerusalem with the left
! hand, and ward off Sanballat with the sword in their
cunning right, but the feat would be beyond the repair-
ing ship. How the Federal Convention would brisk up !
i Most healthy to have the state of things restored, ante
i cable. Australia for the Australians. Convention with-
-1 out the eye of England continuously on it, pulse-feeling
only now and again, when enemy’s cruisers allowed ;
Governors in a quandary. Believe me, what the Conven-
tion lacks is an event of some kind. It is only wading in
treacle, sticking the staves of the casks together without
any hoops. People say, “ Oh, bother; only the Conven-
tion on! When’s the next cricket-match?” But let
there be a bit of a foreign brush, and the Convention
becomes like Ezekiel’s valley of dry bones. They will
rattle together, the spirit of Australia breathes upon
them, from the hot desert, they are clothed with sinews
and flesh, and stand on their feet, an army. Otherwise,
the Convention is academic. Old Age Pensions— Yawn.
Control of Rivers—Yawn. And the biggest Yawn of all
for the Soul-less Banquet.

NERVOUS AND DESPONDENT.
That man can sit in his office day after day
throughout the year and attend to the important
duties of a merchant, financier, departmental-
head, mine-manager, banker, expert, and politician,
&c., and at the same time be tormented by some
ailment which has baffled the M EDICAL PRO-
FESSION. Too close attention to business,
being confined too much indoors, and the worry
and trouble of everyday mercantile, professional
or official life, will knock up the strongest man,
who is suffering from one of the many NER-
VOUS COMPLAINTS which the flesh is heir to.
His NERVES RUN DOWN, and his BRAIN
becomes dull, and all zest for his work is gone.
After incurring FOOLISHLY A BIG DOC-
TOR’S-BILL, he tries some of HERR RASS-

How to excel at Billiards.
Only a few days ago a wonderful game of
billiards was witnessed in one of the principal
billiard saloons in this city, which fairly astonished
everyone present, inasmuch as one of the players
was known to suffer from a long-standing nervous
affection, so much so that he could scarcely hold
the cue in his hand ; but notwithstanding this he
offered his opponent (who was a professional) 50
in 100, and beat him by 20. And he gave Herr
Rassmussen’s Alfaline Vitality Bills the
credit for his wonderful improvement.

“They have magazines in England,"
■writes Sydney Catholic Press, “ where the best
men can meet, but here we have no neutral ground
except the Catholic Press.” “ Neutral !”—ye
gods ! The Consecrated Press !
London would-be literates have had to
give up the trick of asking for Omar Khayyam
(with affected familiarity) as “ Omar,” because the
Cockney bookseller mostly dumps down to them
the Iliad or the Odyssey.
A Melb. “ undertaker and embalmer ” has
his place of business next door to a ham-and-beef
shop—a circumstance rather calculated to lessen
the local appetite for spiced meats. Another
house, at the same end of the town, advertises
itself as open to supply “ a good bed and a faggot
for 4d.”
I The Norddeutscher s.s. Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse has wiped the eye of the Atlantic crack

The latest gem from the Sydney Sunday
Times pen-lady :
How is it that the Melbourne girls win nearly all the
wealthy squatters of N.S. Wales ? From all quarters of
the country I hear that the Southern belles are queening
our homesteads or country mansions, or are engaged to
our young and wealthy land-holders. And now another
engagement is announced—that of Mr. Claude Maodon-
ald, of Wantabadgery, near Wagga, to Miss Ethel Green,
of St. Hilda, and the eldest daughter of a high official in
the railways, Miss Green is a clever, well-dressed, and
handsome woman, who has been for some time earning
her own living in Melbourne. Mr. Macdonald is a
wealthy and fashionable young man, who has seen a
great deal of the world, and is as “ English ” as a colonial
can be. The engagement surprised me. He has a lovely
place, thousands of acres of the best land in N.S. Wales,
and it has been his custom since he returned from Eng-
land to entertain Melbourne celebrities at his station.
Evening dress has long been the custom there. They
have a good library, too, and well-trained servants. A
is alvvavs hoisted when a titled lady or gentleman
visits Wantabadgery.

I S.S. : A meeting was held at St. Colomb’s
Church, Haw-Hawthorn, the other night, to con-
sider the advisableness of dressing the inale
members of the choir in surplices. There was
fierce opposition to the idea from many pious
elders and brethren who detected the finger of the
Pope in the business, but the incumbent and others
eloquently enumerated the advantages of the re-
form, pointing out how very much more beaiitiful
the tenors would be in the pure white surplice of
a sacerdotal life, and enlarging on the attractive-
ness of the baritone and the basso in spotless
draperies. “If the choir is surpliced it will draw
people to the services,” said one official, and
another business-like person was convinced that
a lovely male choir in pretty clothes would
enable the church to wipe off its =Bl5BOO mortgage
in two years. After wrestling with the subject
till well on the early hours of morning, the meet-
ing decided to make the choir as nice arid enticing
as possible, and then went home witli the milk.
If 1 had a church, and wanted to pay off a mort-
gage, I would dress the choir like Marcus Superbus
before his conversion, and then trust in Providence.
I he yearning of man to get into skirts has money
in it.

Me and Cricket—George Giffen's
Book.
George Giffen is a very good cricketer; bub if
he were an archangel and a Federal delegate and a
fellow whom Mrs. Brown-Potter smiled on,, rolled
into one, he couldn’t have a better conceit of him-
self. This is awkward ; for it makes the scoring-
board read “George Giffen, 1; Australia, 2”—
and that sort of cricketer isn’t the right sort of
cricketer for this climate. If an Australian
sportsman can’t put his country and its credit and
interests miles before himself and his credit and
interests, he isn’t a sportsman, and he isn’t a real
Australian.
• * * •
And to think that —without George Giffen —an
Australian eleven could win three test-matches
out of four! Our sainted little brother Walter !
* * * •
Giffen’s book of cricket reminiscences will in-
terest every cricket enthusiast: there is no one
in Australia better qualified to talk about the
game. And the book is profusely illustrated. On
the outside cover it has a portrait of George
Giffen. As a frontispiece it has a portrait of
George Giffen. Facing page 6is a portrait of
George Giffen at the age of 18. At page 29 are
portraits of the Australian Eleven of 1882, in-
cluding George Giffen. A portrait of “George
Giffen (with ball) ” appears at page 36. At page
54 are portraits of the Australian Eleven of 1896,
including George Giffen. And at page 201 there
is a portrait of George Giffen “ready to meet
the ball.”
• • • *
Yes, that’s the lot. There are a great many
other excellent portraits, but the owners can’t
score more than singles, with an occasional bye in
a group. As bowler and author, George “ keeps
himself on.” It’s a good, all-wool habit, and
shoves the beastly other fellow in his proper place.
* • * *
Some Giffen talkee-talkee. “To those who
have never seen one, an Adelaide wicket would be
a curiosity. The curator, for a fortnight or so
before a big match, tends it as carefully as does
a hen her brood of chickens. Towards the day of
the match the grass is shaved with a scythe until
little more than the root is left; and, finally, the
turf having been soaked and allowed to dry to a
proper consistency, the pitch is rolled and rolled
until what remained of the grass has been pressed
into the soil. When this dries the surface is like
nothing so much as a stretch of asphalt with a
glaze upon it, as though it had been polished. I
remember, about twelve years ago, Alfred Shaw
tossing the ball to Ulyett for him to bowl, upon
which he received an apt question from the York-
shireman, who wanted to know what was the use
of asking him to try and bowl on glass ! ”
* • * *
Giffen’s first test-match, Melbourne, 1881 (when
22 years old): —“ We had to go in against 294, and
headed this fine score by 26. When I went to the
wickets Horan was in the midst of a fine innings
of 124. I shall never forget my sensations as I
walked out from the reserve to take my innings.
I had never before faced ,so large a crowd, and
when they gave me a warm, and what was meant
to be an encouraging reception, the weight of re-
sponsibility made me feel like sinking into the
turf. Since then I have always sympathised with
a debutant ima great erickftt-match. Having got
through my first over safely, my nerve returned
to me, and I found that I could play the bowling
all right, but to my surprise I could not, however
hard I smote it, get the ball through the field.
Nevertheless, I continued to bear in mind the
idea that I must keep up my wicket while Horan
was scoring. My partner, perhaps the finest bats-
man Victoria has produced, gave me plenty of
encouraging words, and at length, I believe after
the lapse of half an hour, I notched my first run.
What a yell went up from the crowd to be sure !
I was able to make 30, my last 20 being obtained
about as quickly as my first one.”
* -* * *
“ A good story is told about an Australian bats-
man and his dislike to Peate’s bowling. The
Yorkshireman beat him with a clipping leg-break
in one innings. The batsman, determined that it
should not happen again, got hold of a bat in his
own room at the hotel, and began to make strokes
at imaginary balls. At one he would play back
and mutter, * That’s the way to play you, Peate.’
Then he would play forward, remarking, * Nob
this time, Peate, my boy.’ At last, he ventured
on a big hit at a leg ball, and, swinging round
with a‘How do you like that, Peate? ’ sent the
toilette-set, which he had forgotten all about,
in fragments to the floor. Later on in the day,
confident that he would make a score, he faced
the real Peate, and was clean bowled first balL”
* • * •
Giffen thinks the strongest eleven which has ever
represented England was that of the third test-
match against the 1884 Australian eleven, played
in England—Lord Harris, Alfred Lyttelton, W.
G. Grace, A. G. Steel, W. W. Read, Barlow,
Barnes, Shrewsbury, Peate, Ulyett, and Seotton.
The match was drawn in the Australians’ favor.
• * • •
Giffen-statistics. His batting average in all
first-class matches, 29 77 ; bowling, 1971. Batting
average in test-matches, 23'35 ; bowling, 27'0J.
Seventeen times in first-class matches Giffen scored
over 100. Three times he bowled the hat-trick—
Aust. XI. v. Lancashire, ’B4 ; S.A. v. Vernon’s
Eleven, ’B7 ; Aust. XI. v. Eleven of England, ’96.
All 10 wickets in an innings—For Aust. XI. v.
Combined Australia, at Sydney, 1884, Giffen took
10 wickets for 66 runs ; in ’93, for Norwood Club
v. Adelaide Club, he took all 10 wickets for 149
runs, and then carried his bat through the innings
for 172 runs.
• • * *
Giffen-verdicts. “ Alick Bannerman : ‘The best
batsman of the ‘ barn-door ’ class against whom
I have had to bowl.’ Blackham : ‘ The prince of
wicket-keepers.’ Murdoch: ‘The greatest bats-
man Australia has produced.’ Spofforth:' ‘The
greatest bowler of my time.’ Tom Horan : ‘ The
finest leg-hitter I have seen.’ Lyons: ‘Best
all-round Australian hitter.’” » (Unaccountably
omitted “Best all-round cricketer: George
Giffen.”)
* * * *
Spofforth and Turner compared : “ Turner may
have been as deadly on sticky wickets —to has e
been more venomous was impossible—but he had
not the same command over the ball that Spofforth
had. The Demon, who had made a deep study of
the art of bowling, had a wonderful control over
his pitch, and he seldom turned the ball unless, if
ifc were allowed to pass the bat, it would hit
wicket. On a batsman’s wicket he was not so fine
a bowler, perhaps, as Palmer or Boyle, but let the
pitch give him the least help, and his breakbacks-
became unplayable. What a sight it was to see
Spofforth bowling when a game had to be pulled
line a brand from the burning ! He looked the
Demon every inch of him, and I verily believe he
has frightened more batsmen out than many
bowlers have fairly and squarely beaten. When
the Demon meant business, the batsmen had to
look out for squalls. His pitch would be perfect,
and it was almost impossible to get the ball away
—save, of course, on the truest of. wickets.. His
feat against England at the Oval in 1882 is, per-
haps, the finest bowling performance on record.
Besides this, he has three times done the hat-trick
in first-class matches. ”

Romance or Tragedy —Which?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At six o’clock on the morning of 29th Oct., 1881,
the clipper ship Loch Maree passed through Port
Phillip Heads, homeward-bound for London. At
2 p.m. she was passed off Cape Tiptrap by the
inward-bound steamer Nemesis; next day she
was spoken, near Kent’s Group, by the schooner
Jerfaloon ;and thereafter shedisappeared as effectu-
ally as if the magic wand of some necromancer
had swept her entirely from the bosom of the
ocean. tShe was a powerful and well-found ship,
and a fast sailer—as a run on one occasion from
Fayal to the Downs, over 1500 miles, in days,
amply shows; and she was commanded by a
smart and experienced seaman. Failing to
make her usual passage of 80 days, no uneasi-
ness was felt at first, but days, weeks and months
lengthened into jrnars, and the mystic notice,
“ Missing at Lloyds’,” was the ouly record obtain-
able.
• • • •
On 24th Sept., 1897, a short paragraph appeared
in The Bulletin, giving an account of a Swedish
seaman named Armstrong, employed by Messrs.
Ellis, timber-merchants, of Camden Haven,
N.S.W., who claimed to be the only survivor of
the ill-fated vessel. On account of facts re her rig,
captain’s name, &c., supplied to the Swede’s em-
ployers by the writer (who served four years in
the Loch M.), they interviewed the man. There
seems no doubt that his story is substan-
tially correct ; the ocean mystery of sixteen
years is cleared up, and the secret nursed
in the mind of the obscure seaman is now made
public. His reason for so long withholding the
information no one knows. The lucidity of his
account is somewhat marred by his imperfect
knowledge of English ; but he avers that he
shipped in the Loch Maree in Melbourne.
After being at sea five or six weeks, they were
going along with all sail set, a light breeze and
smooth water, when a squall suddenly struck the
ship, and before anything could be done.the three
masts went overboard, to be immediately followed
by the ship herself lurching and going down head
first. . .
'*• . • »
The disaster took place at 11 at night. Arm-
strong, on reaching the surface, after escaping the
suction of the sinking vessel, commenced to swim,
and near him fortunately discovered one of the
ship’s boats, half full of water, into which he
scrambled. No sign of wreckage or life was visible,
and, as the boat had no oars, he tore some lining-
boards from her bottom, with which he improvised
paddles, and in two days and nights succeeded in
reaching the South American coast. The boat in
which he was saved had that morning been
lowered from the skids on to the main
hatch for repairs, and, weather being fine,
had no lashing on, so it floated off as
the ship went down. It was early in the
morning when he landed. He let the boat,
go, and as there were no signs of inhabitants he
struck in a northerly direction along the beach, and
at evening came across some natives, who supplied
him with food. Next day he met a man on horse-
back, from whom he received a few coppers, and
in a few days he reached th*- town of Pernambuco.
His troubles had so unhinged him that he never
reported the matter, and when questioned as to
his appearance among the people, he gave evasive
answers and pretended not to understand. In
Pernambuco he shipped in an American vessel
and sailed for Callao, carrying with him his secret,
a * * a
It needs the pen of a Clark Russell to ade-
quately pourtray that midnight tragedy.
The ship engaged in her death-struggle wit \
the elements from which she had drawn
her life and motion; a conflict between man’s
ingenuity and the uncontrollable forces of
Nature. Hoarse orders to let go sheets and
halliards, put the helm over, square the main
yard, given in quick succession—-to be instantly
drowned in the wild screech of the pampero, as
the reports of breaking masts and rigging mingled
with the fiendish howls of the squall, and, the
doomed vessel, with torn decks and gaping sides,
heeled over and disappeared utterly.
T • • • *
The squall had passed, its work accom-
plished ; and the moonbeams once more shimmered,
on the water, revealing a solitary figure in a halfr
submerged boat, anxiously scanning the spot from
which his floating home had taken her last
plunge with his 37 shipmates. The picture
of this lonely sailor-lad, adrift on the Atlantic in
a battered and leaky boat, without sail or oar,
carrying with him the harrowing remembrance of
this awful cataclysm, lift to the climax of emotion
one of the tragic ocean-storieS of the century.

“What is the difference between Kaiser
William and God Almighty? God Almighty
knows all things, but the Kaiser knows all tilings
a great deal better.” —C for man saying.
Now, was it Henniker Heaton, or merely
the Hogan man, of whom deceased Frank Lock-
wood remarked (as reported by Lucy in S.M.
Herai-d) this:
TSie bumptious person was back from an Australian
tour, and was full of hiirh appreciation of the hospitality
with which he had met “ at the antipodes,” a phrase which
constantly recurred in the course of his speech. “And
ye he said, “ here lam back again.” “ Ah',” said Lock-
wood, who was one of the guests, to his neighbor at the
dinner-table, “ what 1 like about these people at the anti-
podes is that they know how to return a compliment.”

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a repu’tation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT HE WOULD NOT RECOVER.
THE “NEWCASTLE TIMES ” INVESTIGATES THE
CASE.
Onb of the best authorities oh questions affecting the interest
of this town (says the Newcastle Evening Times) is Mr. Samuel
1 isher, of Cleary-street, Hamilton. The gentleman in question is
one of the best-known men in the city. Such movements as early-
closing reform have engaged his attention, and he has done much
towards bringing tins about in Newcastle. Some time ago we were
informed that Mr. Eisher had passed through a most serious illness,
and his recovery therefrom was really remarkable. We despatched
a reporter to get particulars of his case. Mr. Fisher is very popular,
and considerable anxiety was occasioned among his friends, as the
cause of the .indisposition could not be understood.

covery But, first of- all, what was the nature of your ailments ?”

and altogether life was a burden.
“Yes?”
“ Then, worst of all, I couldn’t eat.”
“ There was a complete loss of appetite ? ”
“ Yes ; I had no appetite, and nothing could tempt me.
Headaches of a most violent character and general disorder,
of course, followed this, my Whole system became completely
run down, and I became a wreck. My friends can tell you
how I suffered. I lost sGlb. weight in 12 months.”
“ Now, what about your recovery. How did it come
about ? ”
“On one occasion, when I had almost given up all hope,
a friend who came out to visit me mentioned Bile Beans, but
I was so sick of buying different medicines that I thought it
would be useless ; but my friend persuaded me, and I con-
sented to give them a trial, and bless the day I did. The
Beans were purchased at Hart and Ferkin’s, and I com-
menced taking them, following directions as near as nos-
sible.”

Reporter interviewing Mr. Fisher.
“Was there any improvement be-
fore you completed the first box ? ”
“Oh, yes,” most emphatically re-
plied Mr. Fisher. “ Why, after a few
doses there was an improvement.
Fully believing in the medicine, I kept
on, and gradually, slowly, and surely
has a cure been effected. The head-
ache and pains have disappeared. I
can eat well and sleep like a top. In
fact, I am as well as ever, and,” added
he, “I’m fit to cut coal, but of course i
I don’t intend to do that.”

Think of it ! What can they think? They were all surprised at the wonderful change, and all
agree that there is something in trying Bile Beans.”
I make this statement and give the testimonial just to show my gratitude, and to let other people
know that there is a remedy which can put them right, as it did me. It is with the greatest of pleasure
that I have answered your questions ; and, what is more, if anyone else desires to ask anything, J

From a Melbourne Resident.
6 principal hairdressing saloons in Melbourne, the “Palmer House" in Collins-street, is
owned by Mr. h. F e.rreira. This gentleman suffered severely from biliousness and liver complaint,

Floated round, and washed around,
Flung a thousand leagues;
Carried round and eddied round,
In Ocean’s mad intrigues—
Grim words upon a shred of cloth,
With human blood scrawled red,
A drifted tale of wreck and wrath—
And thus the Bottle said.
But only those can know, and care,
Who Jiyht the Sea jor bread,
The inner Truth, red written there,
Of what the Bottle said.
Sydney, 1897.
E. J. BRADY.
A Sydney writer tells of a rich Australian
lady who was always boasting of the services of
her father to the country, but never specified what
those services were. Some evil-disposed indivi-
duals eventually found out that her pa had been a
flogger to the Government.
A “goak” was put up on a theatrical
notability in an Australian city recently, and has
only just worn itself out. The notability’s name
is not Jlm Smith, but that will do. A large public
subscription was being taken up, and the originator
of the great “goak ” sent a very trifling donation
to one of the biggest lists in the name of the nota-
bility, and it appeared in the local papers in the
glare of publicity and large capitals, “Jim Smith,
9d.,” underneath the names of magnates who had
forked out their scores. Then the great “ goak”-
maker put himself to about ,£.35 worth of trouble
to start all Jim Smith’s friends congratulating
him on his munificent liberality, by note, and
letter, and wire, and word of mouth, and presently
the afflicted Smith was receiving whole bags of
letters and post cards, all to his own cheek, mostly
congratulatory missives expressing wonder and
delight at his public-spirited action. The manager
of the show with which Smith was associated had
Si ven a decent sum to the charity in question, and
itn concluded that this was in some way respon-
sible for the public error. But his fame continued
to spread, and men met him on corners with ad-
miration in their eyes, and rushed at him with
outstretched arms from numerous pubs, and
f grabbed him ecstatically on the block, and all were
rantic with joy over his noble sacrifice on behalf
of the widow and the orphan. Then suddenly
Jim Smith tumbled with an awful shock, and
bloodshed was narrowly averted on many occa-
sions when men charged down upon him to wag
his liberal hand. Jim now offers a lump sum for
the head of the father of the joke, alive or dead.
The Voice of Peter Henson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]V
Wirrawarra township is so called merely
by courtesy, but Wi rawarra Valley is big and
beautiful, though on the western side thereof
Mount Narramar, dark, grim and forbidding,
rears a frowning head. In a spot near the foot
of Narramar many of the tallest eucalypts are
leafless, white and dead. That is where Peter
Henson lived and died. That Peter’s ghost
wandered about the mountain for some time afler
his sudden exit, is a well-established fact in
Wirrawarra. Being, however, a retiring ard
modest sort of ghost—until bitter necessity made
him bold—it is perfectly true that he was never
seen of mortal eye ; though he used to make him-
self heard to some purpose, mostly in bowlings of
a most lamentable and soul-ha'rowing grievous-
ness. He did his wailing generally on Saturday
nights, but had been known to make special
occasions of holidays.
* * * *
Before he came to Wirrawarra and even-
tually went into the ghost line, Peter had been a
merchant, in a small way, in Sydney. He was
married, but had no children ; and he came home
one day from a short journey to find a letter in
place of his wife. “ Incompatibility of tempera-
ment; unsatisfied yearnings; appearance of ideal; ”
and all the rest of it.
Peter was weak. He turned woman-hater, and
brooded. Later, he brooded more, and his busi-
ness suffered. Last, he brooded all the time,
sold his business, and fled to the solitude of the
bush, whete he could brood more uninterruptedly.
There, the maggot in his brain Anally ate the
pait it lived in, and on the subject of woman
Peter went altogether “balmy,” as Wirrawarra
had it.
He lived like a hermit in a bark humpy at the
foot of Nairamar.and devoted himself to a curious
occupation, which was to call the trees all round
him by the names of women he had known or
read of—and straightway ringbark them. He had
hut one friend in the valley, John Ronald, a long,
lean farmer’s boy, who used to humor the lone
man’s fancies, and whom Peter loved as his son.
“Who’s this?” John asked, one day,
when he found the recluse laying the axe to
a giant red-gum. “ Kate,” Peter answered
laconically. He had already ringbarked the tree,
and was cutting deeply into the wood. Kate was
his wife.
“She’ll come down if you go much deeper,”
John said, and Peter desisted.
Trees were dead and dying all round. Cleopatra
was dead, and so was Lot’s wife; but Bloody
Mary and Emma Smyth-Browne and Eve, and a.
few other ladies, had only just begun to feel their
wounds. Kate was the last; and Kate would die
quickly, for she was sorely hurt.
• * * *
Time brought round the big storm that
Wirrawarra still talks about. It came over the
eastern hills, howled through the valley, and
hurled itself in fruitless fury against the rocks
and scarps of rugged Narramar.
About midnight the sound of a distant crash
came fain ly down against the wind to John
Ronald’s ears, and he guessed that one of Peter’s
women-folk had fallen. ... In the morning
when the wind had fallen John went to see how
his friend had fared. . . . The tree was Kate,
and she had brought ruin again on the house of
Henson, for she had fallen fairly across the humpy,
and Peter lay crushed amidst the « reck beneath
her. Poor Peter ; his wife had been too manyfor
him every time !
• * * •
When it was about a year old Peter’s
ghost died for want of nourishment. This was
how.
In his now line, Peter, as mentioned before, was
never seen of mortal eye ; but he was popularly
supposed to do his howling “ turns ” sitting on the
prostrate Kate. Now, old Robertson wanted a
new post-and-rail fence for his oat-patch. One
Saturday night when he was coming home late
fiom the township, just as Peter was in full blast,
it struck him in an inspired moment that if he
were to cut Kate up for posts and rails, and shift
her on to his farm in that form, Peter would be
handicapped by the want of his wife to sit on
while he was rendering his selections, and, per-
haps, after a bit, would get disgusted and relieve
the locality of his presence. Robertson acted on
the idea, and within a fortnight the deceased
Kate was portion of the new fence.
On the very first Satu day after, everyone who
heard him knew there was something wrong with
Peter; there were plunges, and stoppages, and
an apparent inability to hit the keynote. In fact
there was a general want of body, as it were, about
the perfox-mance ; and, finally, Peter shut up for
the night half-an-hour earlier than usual. Old
Robertson was immensely pleased and proud of
himself, and had the indecency to brag about his
smartnessbut Peter took him down a bit on the
following Saturday, when he started operations
with all his old-time vigor at the corner of the
oat-patch, exactly where Kate commenced.
Apparently, he Was sitting on the corner post;
but next Saturday he got to work apparently upon
the first post from the corner. It was about this
time that old Robertson stopped chuckling.
On the Saturday after that Peter came earlier,
and stayed later, and got through two posts, and
Wirrawari’a remarked that Robertson was getting
to look old and cai eworn.
On the Saturday following Peter made his yioti-
appearance earlier still, and stayed till nearly
daylight, negoiiating four posts, and keeping the
Robertson family awake all night.
Old Robertson was in hopes that when Peter had
howled upon all the posts he would resign, but he
didn’t; he began again at the corner post, and
took to turning up on Friday nights as well, till
at last the ingenious Robei’tson, who was by this
time a mere wreck, gave in and pulled up the
fence and turned it; and Peter gradually faded
a«ay to a mere echo, and finally ceased alto-
gether.

DISTINGUISHED TESTIMONY
His Honour, William P. Courtney, Mayor of Lowell, writes tinder date October
31st, 1896, of the benefit he derived from Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

“I have great faith in the healing virtues of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, be*
cause it has helped me. The medicine cured me of indigestion, which had
troubled me seriously for several years.
''Since I began taking Ayer’s Sarsaparilla my appetite has improved,
I have slept better, and in fact my health in general has been greatly
benefited.” *
We take pleasure in reproducing above the portrait and testimony of
Mayor Courtney, whose services in the cause of good municipal govern-
ment have been recognized in his recent election to the mayoralty of hia
native city for the third year in succession. His experience is the same
as that of thousands of other people, of all sorts and conditions, who
nave found freedom from sickness, and restored health and strength in
the use of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. 6
. 7® it^ iou is the sincerest form of flattery.” There are many worth-
less imitations seeking to profit by the world-wide reputation of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

How Time Flies! We have just entered upon a Hew Year— a year
destined to be one of the most eventful of the present Century,
THE END OF
which is so near. Will the earth continue to turn on its axis and roll us
into the twentieth century 1 Some prophet has said “No ! ” But sensible
peop e will only smile at such wild, improbable theories, and enquire to
what extent the prophet would like to back his opinions f The closing
Century has been an era of invention and scientific and chemical research.
Steam Electricity and the Healing arts affording the most notable
examples of man’s progress, and marking the nineteenth, as the grandest
and most wonderful century in the history of
THE WORLD
During the present year we hope to see our beloved Queen celebrate the
bOth year of her reign; we hope to find in the present year twelve months
Of good trade, good living and good health. And the latter is the chief
blessing; for what enjoyment can man derive from good living if good
health be not in attendance? Everyone, therefore—man, woman and
child should recognise the fact that for Bilious and Nervous Disorders,
ick Headache, Constipation, Weak Stomach, Impaired Digestion, Sluggish
Liver, and Female Ailments no other medicine is required as lons as a
box of Beecham’s T i s
IS AT HAND.
Beecham’s Pills remain at the close of this century as great a public
boon, and as fine a discovery in medical art, as they were more than fifty
years ago, and have fully justified the public verdict that they are Wobth
