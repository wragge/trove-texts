HUDSON’S “Eunienthol Jujubes.” You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told they
are “just as good” as Hudson’s “Eumenthol

Russia
The Red Page
In Stephen Graham, the author of A
Aag abort d in the Caucasus and Undiscovered
Russia, the Slav soul has its finest non-
Slavonic interpreter. In Changing Russia
( Lane, per Dymock’s Library ) Graham con-
tinues his interesting exploration into the
psychology of that strange soul. It is out-
wardly a narrative of a tramp taken by the
author from Rostof-ou-the-Don along the
Black Sea to Batum. with some sketches of
mining life in the Urals. But this book is
more than an itinerary ; it is a philosophy.
British capital is flowing into Russia, for
railways, oil-fields, Ural gold, and town and
harbor construction. English investors are
being “driven out” of that Free Trade
country to the still cheaper labor market ot'
Russia, whose undeveloped wealth and tim-
ber have “great advantages over Great Brit-
ain as a field of investment.”
England is no longer an island, land sur-
rounded by water, for our solid substance is
ceasing to be land, and is becoming gold. ...
If English labor is going to defend itself
permanently, it must develop a virile foreign
policy. It must be ready to interfere in the
domestic affairs of othef countries, and im-
pose its laws not only on the employer in
England but on the employer throughout
the world. Or the workman with his barren
victories will go to the wall. For there are
“blackleg” nations as well as “blackleg”
workmen; strike-breaking nations that are
far more dangerous than private strike-
breakers.
Well, the only weapon with which to hit
the blackleg nations is a tariff.
S
Commercialism is sweeping over Russia,
and every peasant brought into a factory or
a mine or a railway is one man substracted
from the forces of the Tsar, and one added
to the social revolutionary party. Russian
workmen combine more readily than Eng-
lish, and haVe less regard for consequences.
They are, kept in check only by the tremen-
dous odds against them. Once they become
the majority, the Tsar had better emigrate
to Australia. “There is a lust for blood in
Russia that will make all Europe stand
aghast when it finds expression.”
The intellectual movement and the revo-
lutionary movement have failed. But: —
When next there is an outbreak against
Tsardom, it will wear a different com-
plexion. Intellectualism will have disap-
peared, and the passions of the mob will
guide all as far as ; there can be guidance.
The commercial centres of Russia are
already infested with drunken hooligan mobs
only waiting for a chance to murder aud
pillage.
And the Church is relinquishing its re-
ligious authority to enter politics. It
has a bloc of 100 submissive members in the
new Duma, it runs its own candidates, the
priests are asking for votes. “This is per-
haps one of the most astonishing phenomena
of the Russia of to-day.”
An intellectual Russian woman was
amazed on learning that the English suf-
fragettes had not killed anybody.
“It’s like a great game of hide-and-seek,”
said she. “If there had been Russians in
it, your Cabinet would have been differently
composed to-day.”
“One or two celebrities would have been
removed.” I hazarded.
Slie smiled.
Russia is still uncivilised. Out of the
752 towns of European Russia, over 700 are
without drains. There is not a sanitary
town in the whole empire. In Moscow and
Petersburg the rich have spotless English
lavatories and white tiles; but not even the
rich care very much what is under {he white
tiles. Underground all is rotten and defiled.
Disease in Russia is going to increase fear-
fully if Russia is commercialised, and the
size of towns increased. There is no such
thing as a municipal conscience, The aver-
age life of an inhabitant of Moscow is 37.
Graham found all the alleged “health re-
sorts” on the Black Sea undrained and pes-
tilential.
The author has much of interest to say
about Russian journalism.
The brevity of the sentence and the para-
graph has been developed to the absolute.
One discerns in it a sort of Henleyism gone
mad. The average length of a sentence is
just four words, and of a paragraph two
lines. Paragraphs of one word are frequent,
sentences of one word amazingly frequent.
I have actually seen a paragraph which con-
sisted of a dot. (See exhibit 12 lines below.)
Room for a specimen. An aviator was
stopped by the authorities from flying to
Petersburg, in case he might be an anarchist.
Thus the indignant journalist;—
Sablerof has been stopped....
Sablerof lias been forbidden to go to
Petersburg. Why? In Heaven’s name,
why ?
Why? I ask a^ain.
Why the devil?
Why?
The rise of the bourgeois class in Russia,
as opposed to the “over-educated” intellec-
tuals, has necessarily developed the anti-
Russian. His attitude is strikingly like the
attitude of the Australian fatman.
Russia cannot produce what she wants;
the Russian author, be he novelist, play-
wright or poet, is naturally a seeker, a
national dreamer: he won’t do. Forward
the foreigner, Shaw, Jerome, Wells: it is
astoiiishing, but such is the power of the
Russian bourgeois that these three English
authors are now almost as much read in
Russia as in England.
The explanation of the failure of the
Russian author is that he is out of touch
with Russia. Gorki, who has left Russia for
Capri, was Russia's last hope. Nothing
national, in the opinion of Graham, has
appeared since his day. For twopence a
volume the -Russian can get translations of
all the popular books of Europe. It is
easier to get a volume of IV. W. Jacobs at
a bookstall than a volume of Chekhof. Oscar
Wilde’s works, at the same twopence, are
to be seen everywhere. A girl of 12, asked
by Graham who was her favorite author,
replied, “Oscar Wilde.”
At the moment of writing, Wilde is tlie
most popular author in Russia, not exclud-
ing any writer in the Russian language.
For one who knows Tolstoy thoroughly,
there are 1U who know YVilde. Young
ladies sleep with Wilde’s wdrks under their
pillows, and call Dorian drey their Bible.
After Wilde, the most popular contemporary
English authors are Jerome, Wells, Kipling,
Shaw, Jack London. Galsworthy also is
much read. Jerome is taught in schools as
if he were a classic. Chesterton is almost
unknown. His works are inscrutable, whilst
those of the other lover of paradox and
mystification, Shaw, are clear as day. Shaw
is a sort of second-cousin of Wilde and a
step-child of Tolstoy. When he was intro-
duced in Russia it seemed everyone had had
his thoughts before. After Nietzsche had
swept the intelligentia off its feet, it was
necessary to forget pure Nietzscheanism.
and it was pleasant to forget in the more
easy doctrines of Man and Superman.
Nietzsche said it was necessary for man to
live nobly, in isolation, in danger, in free-
dom. Shaw took the responsibility off the
man’s shoulders, and put it on those of the
women. This suited the majority of Rus-
sians very -well, made the women more in-
teresting. and eccentric manners of court-
ship or flirtation more possible.
But there is a national Russian art and
literature. Painting in Russia is now-
swerving from post-impressionism toward
national idealism; and Russian art begins
to be more national than any other modern
art in Europe.
d*
The Russian is rapidly grafting upon his
civilisation the appurtenances of European
industrialism and culture; but that is all.
I? it not a strange fact that in every city
of Russia it is possible to find all the luxury
of the cities of Western Europe, all the
modern conveniences and inventions, and
yet the Russians as a nation have not
manufactured those articles, nor invented a
single machine?.... In the English sense,
the Russians have absolutely no industrial
gift whatever. They have no practical
understanding of machinery and business
beyond that of using other people’s brains.
They do know statecraft. They do know
how to speculate in laud. They do know
how to master, to command, to bully, to
deceive. They do know how to introduce
foreign commodities and sell them in their
shops.
Russian elections show- a similar strange-
ness to Australian ideals. Thousands of
candidates are nominated, and half of these
are then disqualified as not fit persons. The
consequence of this clever procedure is that
in many constituencies the Socialist is con-
fronted with the choice of voting for one of
two or more hard-boiled Conservatives. But,
despite all restrictions, the democratic and
progressive elements show a steady numerical
increase in the Duma. And when the
Socialists become a majority Russia will
become a republic.
A Jap Play
Typhoon, by Melchior Lengyel (Methuen),
is a rather remarkable melodrama. It is a
dramatisation of what happens when Kip-
ling's (East and West do meet. The scene is
set in the Japanese colony in Paris—though
with more dramatic probability it might have
been set in Sydney. Tokeramo’s flat is the
meeting place of all the members of the
colony, whose business in Paris, or Sydney,
is their business everywhere—that of the
spy. But Tokeramo has other interests, for
Western civilisation, in the person of a
French courtesan, has captivated him.
HelCne admits that as a lover “lie’s awfully
clean and never rough ; bnt he’s always grin-
ning and grinning. And one can have too
much grin, you know.” But she suspects
hey “Eastern curio” of being in some under-
hand game; she wants «o find out “what’s
under that parchment grin.” Her other
lover, a decadent French poet, also wants to
know, but solely out of a writer’s curiosity.
In the presence of the Japs, he remarks to a
fatuous French professor :
“Has it ever struck you, Professor, to
wonder what is the motive that brings these
clever, observant, home-loving people to
dwell here amongst lis foreigners, in their
tens, their twenties, and their thirties —not-
ing. recording, planning, smiling and saying
nothing?”
The professor says their motive is the
love of civilisation. “Oh no.” says Beinsky,
the poet. “They’ve got all the civilisation
they want. Jrt 15 years they picked the
brains of their imported European precep-
tors clean; and then by way of gratitude
sent the poor simpletons packing home
again. Oh, yes. they’re ke6n —they’re sharp
as monkeys and supple as cats.”
To this the Japs murmur words of elabo-
rate politeness, but Beinsky, intent on pro-
yoking a row, continues: "I tell you quite
frankly I’ve no esteem for you at all. Your
self-control —well, that’s forced on you; at
home you live in little wood and paper
houses; and if you blow your nose it’s heard
in the street; so you’ve got to be self-con-
trolled. If I must admire a yellow race,
then give me China. They loathe the.
Europeans, and they make no bones about
it; they don’t come purring and tubbing
themselves up against us like cats.” But
Tokeramo smiles, and getting the poet to
admit that he Cares nothing for his own
country, nor for his God, and that he is
“dead sick of himself,” remarks : “Ah, then,
since you hold such opinion, of your coun-
try, your God, and even of yourself —how
can we expect that you should think better
of the Japanese?” But there is a people
even Beinsky admires —-the Russians, and he
does hot hesitate to say so.
The Europeans retire, and the Japs “go
back to Japan” by arranging screens to give
the apartment a Japanese appearance and
by donning their kimonos. And at once the
talk becomes s'erious. “Asia is our heritage.
We are the first of her children to reach
maturity. She is in chains and we must set
her free. Russia has cowered before us... .
Sometimes does Nippon so glow in me, I
feel that in foreign countries and in foreign
cities we are her first soldiers. When the
conquest will be completed, that we may
not know; bnt the 50 millions of Japanese,
they, brothers, must dominate the world!”
But the leaders of the colony are not
satisfied with Tokeramo. for they have heard
of his liaison with Hfelene. She might prove
dangerous; she might turn out to be a police
agent. Tokeramo promises to send her pack-
ing, though, as has been made plain in a
previous scene, the BYench girl has a real
hold over him. And the Japs have only
contempt for the women of the Caucasian
women. “The highest among them go
about with their faces painted like our com-
monest geishas and in dresses designed to
show off every curve of their pampered and
bulbous bodies.” But Helene pleads with
Tokeramo, and the infatuated man succumbs
to her attraction. Then Heßne. sure now
that she has him in her power, taunts him.
laughs at him. calls him “Little Monkey!”
and “Lizard !” and as a supreme insult flings
her rolled-up gloves at the sacred picture of
the Mikado. Thereupon he strangles her.
Recovering from his frenzy. 1 he calls up
through the telephone all the members of
the colony. On their arrival they hold a
council of war and decide tjiat as Tokeramo
is too valuable a man to be hanged for a
mere murder, someone else must shoulder
his crime. Each Jap in turn pleads to
sacrifice himself for Nippon; but the plea
of the youngest, and therefore least useful,
member of the colony proves irresistible. A
plausible story is agreed upon for the police.
The next act shows the room of the in-
vestigating judge. He is a clever judge, so
clever that the Japanese have no difficulty
in hoodwinking him. For one moment their
plans seem about to fail, for Tokeramo, who
has become too westernised to submit to the
sacrifice of a mere boy, confesses that lie is
the murderer. But the judge sees in this
confession only a clumsy attempt to clear
the arrested youth, and, the Japs subtlv
assisting him in his mistake, the judge is
confirmed in his former belief. - The youth
is convicted, and the expert knowledge of
Tokeramo saved for the work of Nippon.
But the fatal influence of the West is too
strong for Tokeramo. He suffers for his
crime: he loved Helene. So. with the proper
ceremonies he commits suicide in the pres-
ence, and with the approval, of his com-
patriots ; and the play ends with the Japan-
ese, in view of tp§ arrival of the police;
scurrying to and fro, getting out, sorting,
destroying and laying aside all sorts of pos-
sibly compromising papers, while from be-
hind the screen the blue wisps of incense
smoke rise above the dead body. A stirring
presentment of a new subject in drama —the
clash of east and west; but the psychology
is cut out in slabs, and the action is melo-
dramatic.
Bergson
Bergson's celebrated essay, An Introduc-
tion to Metaphysics, which appeared in 1903,
before the publication of Creative Evolu-
tion, now appears in an authorised English
translation by T. E. 'Hulme (Macmillan).
This is the work that forms the best intro-
duction to the work of Bergson, for in it he
explains at greater length and in greater
detail what exactly he means to convey by
the word “intuition.” By intuition—the
key-stone of the arcli of the Bergson meta-
physics—is meant “.the kind of intellectual
sympathy by which one places oneself within
an object in order to coincide with what is
unique in it and consequently inexpressible.
Analysis, on the contrary, is the operation
which reduces the object to elements already
known, that is, to elements common both
to it and to other objects. To analyse,
therefore, is to express a thing as a function
of something other than itself.” Therefore
it cannot ever exactly express what James
might conceivably" call the “thingness” of
the thing. There is one reality, at least,
which we all seize from within, by intuition
and not by simple analysis. It is our own
personality in its flowing through time—
our self which endures. And in the effort
to explain the self metaphvsics proceeds by
analysis, like all the other sciences. It re-
solves the self, which has been given to it
at first in a simple intuition, into sensa-
tions, feelings, ideas, etc., which it. studies
separately. It substitutes for the self a
series of elements which form the facts of
psychology. Bergson protests that these
elements are not really parts, and that
therefore, from these mere «vmbols ie
reality of the self cannot be built up
The nearest analogy, Bergson suggests, to
the flux of ones being is that of movement
in space. “Along the whole of this move-
ment we can imagine possible stoppages •
these are what we call the positions of the
mo\ ing body, or the points by which it
passes. But with these positions, even with
an minute number of them, we shall never
make movement. They are not parts of the
movement they are so many snapshots of
it The moving body is never really in
any of these points; the most we can sav
is that it passes through them. But pas-
sage, which is movement, has nothing 5 in
common with stoppage, which is immobility.
The points.... are not, therefore, properly
speaking, positions, but “supposititious,”
aspects, or points of view of the mind. But
how could we construct a thing with points
of view? Nevertheless, this is what we try
to do whenever we reason about movement,
and also about time.... Finally, we say
that movement is composed of points, but
that it comprises, in addition, the obscure
and mysterious passage from one position to
the next. As if the obscurity was not due
entirely to the fact that we have supposed
immobility to be clearer than mobility, and
rest anterior to movement!”,
So it is movement that we must accustom
ourselves to look upon as the simplest and
clearest, immobility being only the extreme
limit of the slowing down of movement. All
that is necessary for us to dp, therefore—
and Bergson says that it is not easy—is for
us to “place ourselves, by an effort of in-
tuition, in the concrete flow of duration.”
And thus there is only one reality that is
external and yet given immediately to the
mind. This reality is mobility. “Not things
made, but things in the making, not self-
maintained states, but only changing states,
exist. Rest is never more than apparent,
or, rather, relative. The consciousness we
have of our own self introduces us to the
interior of a reality, on the model of which
we must represent other realities. All
reality, therefore, is a tendency, if we agree
to mean by tendency an incipient change of
direction.” If you want to get anywhere
in a train, it is no use waiting outside the
train to watch it as it passes. You must
get into the train, “in order to traverse with
it the immobile positions.” Also, you have
got to sound “the depths of pure duration.”
As to conscious intuition, Bergson re-
marks that there is nothing mysterious in
this faculty. “Any one of us who has at-
tempted literary composition knows that
when the subject has been studied at length,
the materials all collected, and the notes all
made, something more is needed in order to
sef about the work of composition itself, and
that is an often very painful effort to place
oursplves directly at the heart of the
subject, and to seek as deeply as possible
an impulse, after which we need only let
ourselves go. This impulse, once received,
starts the mind on a path where it redis-
covers all the information it had collected,
and a thousand other details besides; it
develops and analyses itself into terms
which could be enumerated indefinitely.”
Yet we cannot turn back and seize the im-
pulse behind this work, for it 'was not a
thing, but the direction of a movement.
Metaphysical intuition seems to be some-
thing of the same kind.
Well, if the reader likes this sort of thing,
lie can find it in Bergson, and will doubtless
feel happier and hungrier after it.

FALSE SPRING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On hearing a small, thin piping in the garden
hedge, on a deceptively mild June morning.
For a little while at least, lo! the wind and rain
have oeased,
And a warm wind 6tirs the grass and wakes the
trees ; *
All the morn is full of charm as a maiden’s rounded
arm f*
You can leave your coat or take it, as you please.
Now no longer harsh and rude, Nature in a softened
mood,
Sheds a gracious Springtime warmth that is absurd.
Though a Springtime piping clear in the garden
hedge I hear,
I am sorry for that small, deluded bird.
Oh, it needs a foolish bill to uplift Te Deums shrill
Ere July has blown its first terrific note!
In the garden there’s a fool who will find his bough
too cool
If he chirps too long. (You'd better take your
coat;
For I notice in the sky there are black clouds racing
high,
And this interval of Spring will never last.)
Hear that feathered idiot squeak! Oh, he’d better
hold his beak
If he’d save his small tail feathers from the blast.
Ah, that small, incautious bird with his Springtime
song absurd,
Piping gaily ere the Winter’s rage is spent,
Stands for Confidence Misplaced, and Youth’s Ever-
lasting Haste,
And the Bushing of the Fool on joy intent.
Yet, if Death should stop his row, and the tempest
lash his bough,
And his hapless feathers dance upon the flood,
I’ll remember gratefully how the winged fool sang
to me
In his Springtime rapture, ere his name was Mud.
N.S.W.
THE RELIGIOUS EDITOR.
Merani: “Jeames” was wrong in blaming
Ladysmith for rousing the late Alfred
Austin’s muse to indite that ditty about
“the women and children.” The Jameson
raid was responsible for the laureate’s
jingle. Thus: —
Wrong! Is it wrong? Well, may be;
But I’m going, boys, all the same!
Do you think me a burgher’s baby
To be scared by a scolding name?
For all that, Jameson received a sentence
of 10 months from a British tribunal.
Which shows that it would probably be
unwise to make the Poet Laureate ex officio
Chief Justice or even J.P.
The French duel, which had been brought
to ridicule by infuriated politicians and
other respectable combatants who invariably
failed to do anything shocking, got a serious
advertisement the other day when two mem-
bers of a Parisian “push” fought with
pistols and knives for the ownership of just
one girl. One Apache bloke i~ said to have
died of two bullet wounds and five stabs,
whilst the other hooligan succumbed to three
bullets in the head. An Apache, seemingly,
has as many lives as a cat, and takes some
time to fall fatally wounded. Or nerhaps
each combatant received extra bullets from
the other one’s pals. The cable is silent on
this point, but it states that three spectating
rowdies were seriously wounded through
standing in the line of fire, so that the louts
hit them by accident. "They ptcbably de-
served it.
Some of the people who helped to raise
Ferdinand to the inverted kerosene tin (now
the throne) of Bulgaria in the far back are
probably regretting the trouble they took.
First he grabbed Eastern Koumelia. Then
he declared himself Czar of the Bulgarians
and told the Unspeakable Turk that if he
didn’t like it he could go to Mecca and
lump it. Next he engineered the alliance
against Turkey and proved that he had
been preparing that splash for years with
tremendous determination. Apparently his
dream is to establish a sort of Balkan Em-
pire under the hegemony of Bulgaria and
Ferdinand. Ferdinand is an ambitious man
with a face like that generally debited
against Mephistopheles; he has the aenius
of organisation, the ability to wait, the
daring to hit suddenly and mighty hard
when the time is ripe, and a few other quali-
fications useful to any young, pushing man
in the king business. If the abovementioned
idea is his dream there will be a lot of blood
shed before it materialises. Both Servians
and Greeks will fight to a finish for their
independence, for each of them has also a
dream of one day dominating the Peninsula.
And right at Ferdinand’s back is the bayo-
net of the old Roman province of Rou-
mania, which, the other day, bluffed
Bulgaria and Ferdinand into yielding up
the town of Silistria and a slice of terri-
tory with a sea-frontage. He is in for a
big gamble, is Ferdinand the Czar; and he
may emerge from it as one of the Powers
of Europe, or as a prisoner with his back
to a wall and his front to a shooting party.
Ferdinand is only 52, so he has time to
make a splash before he qualifies for the
old-age pension. Incidentally, a favorite re-
creation with this ambitious and wicked-
faced monarch is botany, and he would
almost leave a battle in order to look at a
primrose by the river’s brim. By the way,
as Bulgaria is taking a place among the
progressive and civilised States of Europe,
it ought to do something decent and respect-
able for old Baldwin, the first Latin em-
peror of Constantinople. The Bulgarians
captured him and shoved him into a dun-
geon in the year 1205, and he hasn’t been
seen by any reliable authority since. How
is the old man being treated, and is he on
hunger-strike, and what is happening to
him?
The Spiritual Military League extends
operations to Australia. It is an English
revolutionary body that demands an imme-
diate sub-editing of the marriage service to
secure the elimination of the promise to obey
and the removal of fourteen other “humilia-
tions to women” that marriage in the An-
glican Church involves. With the great
army of suffragettes standing the Mother
Country on its ear, and pouring oil and burn-
ing matches into its letter box, and throw-
ing dead dogs into its holy of holies, the
idea that the sex is being subordinated by
a promise of obedience made at the altar
seems a trifle incongruous. There are more
obedient husbands than wives to-day. The
woman promises to be mild and humble
while riveting the chains on her prey, and
then shrieks about her “fifteen humiliations.”
Meanwhile the married man brings home the
dinner meat in a crushed spirit.

Dangers of Varicose Veins.
Few people realise until too late how very dangerous to their existence Vari-
cose Veins are. If you suffer from these veins, or even have them, let us send you
a free book describing their dangers, and more particularly the VECSEY METHOD
of curing them. Hundreds endorse it, as it is purely a home treatment, and does
not require laying up, and is entirely harmless. No one who has varicose veins or
ulcers should delay an hour iri obtaining full information on the subject. We
have treated and cured hundreds, and can probably do the same for you, once we
know your condition, GUARANTEE GIVEN IN EVERY CASE ACCEPTED.
In some of the worst cases known, even where the victim has been unable to
walk, the patient has been restored to his feet inside three days, and a few weeks
under treatment has absolutely healed and banished the ulcers and permanently
cured the varicose veins, so t'"it not a sign, except slight scars, remains, to show
where the trouble originally existed. A painless cure without laying-up is, under
the circumstances, a positive boom to humanity.
Send 2d. stamp for free book of full particulars, or call for free consultation.
Very few cases are incurable. Write or call to-day. Hours: 10 a.m. to 4 pm.

A Joy Ride.
The day was fair and simple,
The gnome began to purr,
lhe sky had scarce a dimple,
The wind forgot to stir—
Oh, it was sweet and simple
To sail the skies with her !
Below us drowsed the Sunday,
The church bells called to prayer.
We knew that Mrs. Grundy
Could never scale the air;
We left behind the Sunday,
And didn’t greatly care.
Our wings were spread and shining,
Our engine softly stirred,
One cloud with silver lining
Mistook us for a bird ;
The golden sunlight shining
Laughed for the thing it beard.
For we were softly sliding,
Amelia Jane and I,
The world deriding,
Athwart’a peerless sky—
Oh. we were softly sliding
Particularly high.
Up there her cheeks were roses,
Her lips a scarlet flame;
If anyone supposes
My fancy was to blame,
Why, let him fly with roses
Through airs with summer tame!
We left the world behind us,
And floated far and free,
The green earth could not bind us
We spurned the hazy sea,
We left the world behind us—
Oh, birds of light were we!
Soft as an eagle’s feather,
Light as a homing dove,
We sped through crystal weather
The moon and stars above.
We passed them like a feather,
And kissed again for love.
And then we saw the flashing
Of palace arches white,
And marked the swift sun splashing
His chariot wheels with light—
Oh, Allah’s turban flashing
Was trying to the sight!
We felt our pulses shiver,
We had to dive and duck,
But from one bright joy’s quiver
We paused a ray to pluck ;
We felt our pulses shiver,
But kissed again for luck.
Then we came softly sliding,
Amelia Jane and I,
A thin white cloud dividing
Athwart the peerless skv ;
Our ’planes came softly sliding
Till Sydney town was nigh.
We flew right into Sunday
As good folk came from prayer;
We passed near Mrs. Grundy
With star-dust on our hair,
We landed right on Sunday,
And Sunday didn’t care.
My lady’s cheeks were roses;
Such blooms as Sadi grew;
If anyone supposes
My story isn’t true,
Why, let him fly with roses
The summer way we flew!

Laughter.
If .Toy it is makes laughter grow
I would be always laughing now.
For, wheresoe’er my sight is set
Gleams bright the native violet;
And midst the lichen and the moss
Their white and purple small blooms toss.
The wattles show, like tinctured snow,
Where’er my raptured eyes may go,
And the heart of a wild, pink rose
Teaches me more than knowledge knows.
The yellow sun-washed hills decree
Laughter to ripple and run through me.
And with each windy gust there comes
The pungent scents of swaying gums.
Oh, that I might to all men bring
The wonder of this joyous thing;
Picture in prose or balladry
These faint hills rolling to the sea,
This track into the woody hill
With secret whip-birds calling shrill,
Where speckled beeches bow and spread
Brown carpets for our feet to tread.
Come and tramp, tramp, tramp away.
Through breaking dawn to dying day !
Oh, that I might to all men bring
The wonder of this joyous thing!
For laughter is a sin, maybe.
Unless all men can laugh with me.

care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-

the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
■ the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and

THE HOLE IN THE CORNSTALK
CASH.
The present New South Wales Government
will probably go down to history as the
Busted Ministry. And by acquiring a dis-
tinctive name, even of that sort, it may
achieVe a species of temporary immortality
or passing fame, or something of the sort.
It may rank with the Ministry of All the
Talents, and the Ministry of Three
Devils, and the Clean Shirt Ministry, and
the Mad Parliament, and the Drunken Par-
liament, and the Short Parliament, and the
Long Parliament, and the Rump Parliament,
and the Know-Nothing Party, and the Party
that voted the Loco-foco Ticket, also the
Hunkers, the Barn-burners, and such-like
picturesque political institutions. It is
something to have a name and to stand out
from the ruck. The McGowen Ministry,
which is now the Holman Ministry, seeing
that James of Redfern, property-owner and
Sunday-school teacher, has got off the bridge
of the crippled ship—has finished its finan-
cial year with an heroic deficit —such a one
as the surprised State never saw before.
Looking at the accounts in one way it has a
shortage of between £900,000 and £1,000,000.
Looking at them another way it has a
shortage of between £1,200,000 and
£1,300,000. Whichever way the figures are
looked at, it seems to remain the same old
record shortage. And the Cabinet achieved
this splendid act of bankruptcy, not in a
period of drought and poverty and panic, as
was the case with Premier Dibbs a good
many years ago, but in a time of good har-
vests, high prices, and constantly increasing
revenue ; also, in a period when the biggest
loan boom that the State ever knew had
created a marvellous artificial prosperity on
top of the real or legitimate prosperity.
New South Wales dug up over £16,000.060
of revenue last financial year, which was
almost £280,000 more than it collected in the
previous year, and £6,000,000 more than it
collected in the last year of Separation.
That is to say, that in 1900 there was a
revenue of £9,973,736, out of which the
Treasurer had to meet not only all the
charges that he is responsible for now, but
also the cost of running the Postal Depart-
ment, the bill for military and naval defence,
a very large account for charities, which is
now greatly relieved by the payment of
Federal old age pensions, and other items
which the Commonwealth has shouldered in
recent times. And though it was a year of
depression and drought, that old Treasurer
got through with a deficit of a little over
£lOO,OOO. On the other hand, in 1913, the
revenue was £16,053,806. The military,
naval and postal expenditure had been taken
over by the Commonwealth. The Federal old
age pension system had lifted a great load
off the local Charities Department. In
every way the path of the State Govern-
ment had been made easier. Yet, as already
mentioned, the hole in the cash-box was
something wonderful.
There has been, as already mentioned, no
diminution in the loan expenditure, and no
unusual charge on revenue for matters that
used to be debited to the lOU fund, to
account for this trouble. While the ordinary
expenditure flew up inside 13 years from
£10,086,186 to over £17,000,000, the borrow-
ing boom boomed even more furiously.
Loans in the profligate financial year which
ended on June 30, 1900, amounted to rather
under £2,800,000, which was bad enough in
all conscience. For the year which ended
on June 30, 1913, they extended to a trifle
over £9,000,000, which is a record such as
no Australian State ever saw, or heard of,
or dreamt of before. The railways have
been muddled down from a position in which
they showed a profit of over half a million
a year to a state of dead loss, and fares —
except as regards workmen’s tickets, the
holders of which are supposed to be reli-
able supporters of the Holman-McGowen
Government —have been raised with a view
to keeping the greatest “permanent and re-
productive work” of N.S.W. out of
insolvency. The small amount which the
Ministry pays annually in reduction of the
public debt is actually less than the
amount which its predecessors paid. Yet
it contrived, in the year of its final mad-
ness, to rush up the ordinary expenditure by
£1,590,435. That was the extent to which
the- outgoings for the 12 months to June 30,
1913, exceeded those for the correspond-
ing period a year before. Even if the in-
come-tax were doubled it would hardly fill
the; hiatus, and if the expenditure keeps
growing at the present rate there will
soon be another hiatus on top of the present
one, and the income-tax will require to be
doubled again. The total expenditure out
of revenue and loans rose from nearly
£18,000,000 at June, 1910, to nearly
£23,000,000 at June, 1912, and a mere
shade under £27,000,000 at June, 1913. And
there is very little that is tangible, save the
huge shortage in the cash, to show
for all this extra expenditure. It seems
to be in the main a silly, confused
dribbling away of money in order to
buy popularity, which sometimes means
votes. In other words, it seems to cost the
country about £1,600,000 per annum in
extra expenditure to keep Holman in a
billet worth £lB7O per annum. That is
where the costliness of the complete in-
capable, who has no scheme for the securing
of popularity save by dashing around money,
comes in. He is always acquiring Id. or so
of legitimate popularity by hurling around,
in a rather purposeless fashion, 19s. lid.
of public funds. The George Turner kind
of man could earn public applause and ad-
miration and his wages by cutting down
expenditure in the public interest. The
other kind of man earns general support by
throwing all pretence of solvency and
financial decency overboard, and by going
mad on a large scale.
The Government, speaking in its own
defence, like an animal of large discourse,
alleges that the reduction of the grant from
the Federal Treasury must, in common jus-
tice, be considered. In the language of
Premier Holman : “To write an article on
the finances of the State without mentioning
the decrease in the returns from the Com-
monwealth is like writing a history of
Christopher Columbus without mention-
ing the discovery of America.” But even
apart from the simple fact that Christopher
Columbus didn’t discover America any
more than James Cook discovered Aus-
tralia or Premier Holman discovered Lon-
don, the explanation is a fraud and the
analogy is bogus. The revenue which the
Holman-McGowen Government had to
spend was the biggest in the State’s history,
whether the Commonwealth nayments fell
off or not. But of late the Commonwealth
payments have not been fallipg off. During
the year that ended on .Tung 30, 1912, the
Federal subsidy to N.S.W. was £2,046,993.
and in that year there wa§. a very small
deficit. During the year that ended on June
30, 1913, the Federal subsidy was
£2,175,817, which was not a decrease, but
an increase of £128,824. No other item of
revenue, bar railways and tramways, showed
anything like thi-s expansion. Yet the deficit
was there solely because of the bloated
expansion of the expenditure. The wailing
of Treasurer Cann to his colleagues -to go
slow was in itself evidence of that. The
Holman-McGowen aggregation went drunk
or mad or fanti, or else it saw the General
Election approaching and set itself to Jbvpy
support and appreciation by giving almost
everybody a job at the public expense. The
position changed inside a year from
comparative solvency to something nearer
plain ruin than the State ever saw
before. To charge this disaster to the
decline in the Federal subsidy, when the
Federal subsidy had really increased, seems
like premeditated misrepresentation or inten-
tional confusion of mind. And to drag in,
by way of illustration, poor, honest, dead
old Columbus, who can no longer come
round to defend himself, seems like cow-
ardice, aggravated by libel and constructive
body-snatching. There was nothing in the
career of the buried sailor of Genoa to jus-
tify anybody in hauling his bones into this
controversy.
The shame and disgrace of the party which
calls itself Labor in N.S.W. State politics,
but which seems much more akin to lunacy,
lies in the fact that it was sent into office
on the most cast-iron pledge of economy,
solvency and honesty that the builders of its
platform could devise. It was rather to pay
off debt than to pile it on. Possibly the
builders didn’t really mean it, and were only
playing to the gallery, but that is another
question. Incidentally, the men in office
pledged themselves to a policy of decentral-
isation, and guaranteed in vapor a number
of other reforms. It had more good profes-
sions to the square foot .than any of those
who went before it. Yet not even the worst
Tory Ministry which Australia ever pos-
sessed proved more Tory in many respects
and more costly in every respect than did
this combination led by a Sunday-school
teacher and an affable and plausible
lawyer. It has gone back on its alleged
policy in a grand, wholesale fashion, and it
seems even devoid of that moral sense which
would make any decent political crowd half-
inclined to apologise for its treachery. Ap-
parently it is incapable of realising that it
has done anything that calls for apology. The
only reason which can be assigned for the
failure, or partial failure, which befell the
honest, respectable and fairly capable Fed-
eral Labor party at last election was that
the N.S.W. State Labor party had caused
the name of Labor to stink like Sodom and
Gomorrah, not to mention Admah and
Zeboim, by pursuing a policy that was con-
trary to all Labor principles. The chance of
the N.S.W. State Labor party lies now in
the unpopularity of its chief opponent. It
may pull through, simply because the Lib-
eral hope is Charles Gregory Wade.
Wade is in the peculiar position of being
objectionable when compared with Fisher,
and quite desirable when compared with
Holman and co. Gifted as he is with .a
boundless capacity for doing the wrong
thing, he insisted on needlessly comparing
himself with Fisher, by butting into the
late Federal controversy. It was a badly-
selected proceeding, but it was so very like
Wade.
ABOUT PERISHED GOLDFIELDS.
Dear Bulletin, —It was moved in a re-
cent issue of your immoral and degraded
publication that Ballarat was a worn-out
institution, regarded as a goldfield, and
ought to be shut up, or killed, or scrapped,
or something. To all of which I agree.
The trouble about a great goldfield is that
it lives so long after it is dead. Ballarat
isn’t exceptional in this respect, though it
is a bad case of living deadness or peram-
bulating decease. Even once-glorious Ben-
digo is now, a great part of its time, an
animated corpse, walking rouhd on , light,
dead feet, to save the cost of burial. When
once a really old field gets into thei-habit of
making fl in calls for every 15s. or 17s. 6d.
that it pays in dividends, then it is time to
think of its funeral. A young field does that
sort of thing as a matter of course. N. 6 one ex-
pects an infant to pay for its feeding-bottle
and sundries. A middle-aged field may do
it now and then without disgrace, just as
an able-bodied man may go temporarily off
the dividend list, through sickness or acci-
dent, and become, for a time, a charge upon
the community. But when the old, grey-
whiskered concern does it most of the "time,
and does it on a larp-e scale, it is time to
consider whether the game is worth the
candle—whether the old shafts shouldn’t be
filled with prickly pear,-or used as a recep-
tacle for the town sewage and garbage, and
the whole business abandoned. Think of
the sound of garbage striking the bottom of
a shaft 4200 ft. deep. There is something
large and wholesale and inspiriting about
the idea. In my opinion, garbage can’t fall
too far, or hit the floor too heavily.
On the perishing goldfield the people are
generally older than the average, and the
wages are generally poor. And when the
miners ask for better pay they are met by
the reply that good pay is impossible a
place that is running at a loss. Which
would be a solid argument if the mines were
kept going as a matter of charity, for
no one expects high wages in a Benevolent
Asylum. But they are not. They are pre-
served as gambling counters. No one ex-
pects a pack of cards to yield a profit in
the aggregate to the people who use, it. It
isn’t productive. Nothing grows on it. In
the end the price of the pack is a dead loss,
and incidentally it has led, while it lasted,
to much outlay-for the rent of the room it-
was used in, for the gas, for wear and tear
of the furniture, and other items. The
money one man loses over it some other
man wins, barring, of course, the coins that
are dropped through holes in the floor
at the settling up. But in the aggre-
gate the business is assured failure. Yet no
one expects card-makers to work below cur-
rent rates at. the manufacture of the gam-
bling implements that the public craves for
and makes a dead loss by. And if a
tion of the public prefers to gamble with a
hole in the ground, instead of with three
aces and a pair of kings—well, it should
pay market value for its hole. For my own
part, I prefer cards to holes, and I have
to pay market value for my cards—also for
the drinks. When a great goldfield becomes
worn out, and calls are regularly in excess
of dividends, and the brokers begin to eat
one another because the public has been to
a great extent, eaten already, then it should
be registered as a public gaming house and
the employees should be set down as crou-
piers, and the Croupiers’ Union should get
a Wages Board award. A few men might
still be kept on at mining for the sake of
appearances, but that wouldn’t be reallv
necessary. There might simply be a “spin-
ning jenny” at the top of each shaft, and
the mining speculator might put down his
stake and have a fly at the gamble. Thus,
when the pointer stopped at “Gold at
600 ft.,” the machine would pay out six to
one. “Gold at 2000 ft.” might be 20 to one.
On the other hand, if the pointer stopped at
“mullock,” “unpayable,” “no prospect,”
“mine flooded,” or the like, the bank would
take everything. This would save a lot of
dust and digging, and would get there just
the same.
But the Government should take over the
deepest big property on Bendigo, with a lot
of ground attached, and do some mining of
its own for purely scientific reasons. That
is to say, it should sink the shaft 100 miles
or so, and thus, for the first time, do-some
real investigation of the interior of the
earth. Somehow no Government has yet
attempted this, so far as the public is
aware. Yet great sums are voted for jthe
maintenance of observatories, where men sit
and look through a shaft or funnel at the
stars, and ponder immensely thereon. Some day,
it may be, an astronomer will discover gold
—boiling gold, perhaps—in Jupiter, by this
process ; but, as he won’t be able to get at
it, neither he nor his employer will be any
further forward. If the funnel or orifice
went down, instead of up, and men pon-
dered downwards instead of upwards, some-
thing tangible and getatable and saleable
might be struck. If the find was gold, on
a monumental scale, and the Government
kept the thing very, very dark, it might
pay off its public debt and buy up a good
deal of the earth and the valuables and the
railways and the shipping and old ruined
castles thereof, before the news got around
and the inevitable slump made the yellow
metal useless as a medium of exchange. In
fact, the country that gob there first might
have a great time. And even if nothing was
found save a little information, the business
would cost no more than any other form of
unsuccessful mining. It would be merely
a matter of one long hole instead of a multi-
tude of short ones. For my own part, I am
weary of short holes. In the days when I
foolishly mined and gambled in scrip, I
dropped more money down short holes than
lam ever likely to possess again. And all
the information that came up in repayment
w as to the effect that the Great Blather reef
down in the Blighter Extended had proved
disappointing.—Yours ever, Henry Horse-
collar.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Conscientious Boy.
Dear Bulletin, —The case of Sidney
Crosland, the youth who was stepped upon
very lightly for refusing to do his bit of
training, is being advertised by the Peace
Society and such-like institutions for all it
is worth. Crosland said he had conscien-
tious objections to compulsory military edu-
cation, and he even refused to attend the
medical examination which cadets have to
undergo. Now, no one has yet asked this
much-belauded person to fight. He has only
been asked to drill, to learn to carry himself
upright—in fact, to render unto Chssar the
obedience that is CLesar<s, especially when
Caesar is the great bulk of the community.
It would have been plenty of time for him to
start waving his principles and his halo of
martyrdom round his head, and posing as a
lion in a den of Daniels, when he was called
upon to do actual slaughter, which
might never have happened; in con-
sequence of which non-happening he would
never have got the advertisement, and the
blare, and the trumpet-call, and the whoop,
and the glory, and the magnificence,
not to mention the thunder, and the light-
ning, and the roar, and the cataract, and the
limelight—including the clamor and the
boost. Meanwhile it seems up to the Peace
Society crowd to consider certain points.
One is that it is just as sinful—though not
so dangerous—to pay other men—soldiers
and policemen, say—to fight as it is to fight
in person, and it looks a shade more con-
temptible on the part of a person with a
tender conscience. Yet apparently not one
conscientious objector has conscientiously de-
ducted his share of the naval and military
outgoings he . can find the amount in
Knibbs’s Statistics—from his direct taxes,
? n -i-iJ 0Ug kt bubble reputation at the
bailiff s mouth by letting his goods and chat-
tels be seized for arrears. Furthermore the
I eace Society man might do well to remem-
her. that compulsory military service is a
Divine institution. Only once is it recorded
that the Lord made a code of laws for a
nation, and that code simply blazes with the
compulsory, military service idea. “The
officers which were over thousands of the
hosts, the captains of thousands and cap-
tmns of hundreds... .said unto Moses:
lhy servants have taken the sum of the men
M war which are under our charge, and there
lacketh not one man of us .’ ” The one man
who was exempt from military service in
Israel was the new bridegroom, and he was
tree for one year only. Incidentally it was
when the Spirit of God came upon Saul”
that the farmer-king at Gibeah ordered
a levy en masse of the people, and
denounced heavy punishment on any and
every blighter in all Palestine who shirked
the war of liberation and stayed at home.
Apparently the question at issue just now is
whether S. Crosland or Jehovah is the
better authority.—Yours truly, Henry
Horsecollar.
A Matter of Law and Compensation.
Dear Bulletin, —That swollen monopoly,
Sydney I erries Ltd., which grows more arro-
gant every day, issues its season tickets to
subscribers with overwhelming pomp. A
mass of small print regulations and condi-
tions encumber the application form or
agreement which the intending passenger
signs before his ticket is hanued to him.
Condition Id is humorouslv comprehensive.
It runs or blithers as follows;
Ufi L 3 T The Com P an y shall not be liable for loss of

in connection with the running of a ferry
ptvice or the loading, carrying, handling, shipping,
r delivery of such coal or materials to the Company,
nr any Other persons employed, directly or indirectly,
in the business or industry of running, a ferry service,
I am now drafting a sort of counter-agree-
ment for the passenger to present to the
overbearing co. for signature. The clause
which corresponds to the Ferries’ No. 13
rushes along in this fashion:—
The passenger shall not be liable for loss of the
raotairis or crew’s life, or lives, or any injury or
tipfay suffered by any member of the crew, or anv
lamage to the boat, or to the feelings of other pas-
sengers, or of the crew, or to the luggage, goods,
chattels, religion or politics of any person whatso-
ever whether caused by drinkings, uproar, bad lan-
guage rotten language, kickings, arguments, crowd-
ing shoving in the alleyways, throwing of banana
skins parcels, pipe or furnace ashes, or by snoring,
veiling, singing, whistbug, hooting, the playing or
ill treatment of any musical instrument, or any
mechanical contrivance whereby offensive noises may
he produced or manufactured, the beating of drums,
dogs wives, children or lady friends, the throwing
of dice or card-playing, the practice of two-up,
cock-fighting, ferret matches, dog or cat fights, or
anv mixture or variations of same, the bringing
aboard of lions, tigms. hyenas, bears, wild elephants,
vultures, kites, snakes, ostriches, wild cats, polecats,

or kind of animal, bird, reptile, insect, fish, jim-jam,

the boring of holes, cavities, apertures or vacancies
in or about the hull or superstructure of the vessel
by such animated baggage or impedimenta, or any
explosions, swampings, scuttlings, stoppages, delays
or standings caused, dircotly or indirectly, by stam-
pedes side-steppings, fights or riots, caused, or
started, or practised by such animal, bird, etc., etc.,
or any sub-animal, bird, etc., etc., that such ori-
ginal animal, bird, etc., etc., may be carrying, con-
cealing, enduring or wearing on or about their per-
sons harness or accoutrements, whilst on, or about,
or within sight ,of the goldarned vessel aforesaid.
Mind you, I don’t pretend for a moment
that that clause is complete. It is just a
rough outline of one clause of the agreement
lam preparing. If my fellow North Shore-
men give me sufficient encouragement, I will
get to work on it and armor-plate it with
so many conditions that the wretched co.
will burst into tears and go and hide its
aching head under the last balance-sheet.
Just here the office lawyer butts in gravely
with a pertinent question, i.e., Does the co.
accept any responsibility for the cash cus-
tomer —the one who has signed no applica-
tion and accepted no ticket, but who pays
his bothersome tuppence and goes through
the turnstile? Then, supposing a season
ticket-holder decided that he would rather
take the Harbor risks as an unsigned cash
customer, would the co. give him back his
signed agreement and a fair proportion of
the unexpired portion of his season ticket,
if he dumped the creased document or watch-
chain ornament on the counter? These two
questions are of great moment to
Shore travellers, -most of whom sign their
ticket applications amidst uproar and con-
fusion. whilst 'tffiarging thoughtlessly to or
from the boat. Probably only a very small
number read the small print conditions on
which their tickets are issued to them. And
in the event of accident and loss of life,
those tiresome junks of villainously small
print may mean no compensation, or a fight
in the courts for the widow and the orphan.
The Ferry Co., of course, is only trying to
make itself as safe as possible, and, to do it
justice, it seems to have entrenched itself
very carefully. But the subscriber owes the
same duty to himself. He can’t afford to be
less cautious than the wealthy monopoly to
which he daily trusts his life. —Yours truly,
Kodak.
The Englishman and His Sewing
Machine.
And I, an old man of 40, how do I live in this
Empire upon which the sun never sets? In the sum-
mer I get casual employment at my trade, in the
winter I help my wife make shirts at from seven-
pence to a shilling the dozen. Yes, T, one of God’s
Englishmen, an inheritor of our pomps and glories,
bend over the sewing machine day after day making
shirts. Even that is not enough to keep us from the
workhouse. We have poor relief as we 11.... Some-
times I lie upon my miserable bed racked with
sciatica, but the looming demon of starvation will
not let me rest, he drags his slave up to make
shirts for other slaves at sevenpence the dozen. —An
English house-painter in the British Review for
May, 1913.
Years ago, when Hood wrote his haunting
“Song of the Shirt,” the needle pusher was
a wretched Englishwoman ; but the glory of
England has blazed up enormously since those
old, dim, tallow-candle days, and now the
original stitcher’s granddaughter has her
English husband to help her. That hopeless
house-painter of 40, whirring absurdly at
his wife’s sewing machine, is a dumb and
dreadful answer to acres of triumphant Free-
trade statistics and hogsheads of Empire
froth. The system which can produce him
is rotten, and the country that continues to
endure him is ready to go down to the dust
at the first real push. He can’t be ex-
plained away with figures, and no amount
of decimal points will still the accusing
clatter of his toil. The flags may flap, and
the guns may boom ; but when the night has
come, and the flag-wavers and salute-firers
have gone off duty, he is still pedalling and
churning (at the rate of 7d. the dozen), in
his frantic race with Starvation. He seems
to be there to bear witness to the fact that
the country which sinks the fiscal issue
sinks its national soul. Hear him again,
this lost soul of 40, who describes himself
as one crying “out of the depths” :
Thousands of those around me do not know the
meaning of change or color in their lives. Their
existence is a perpetual monotonous struggle with
poverty. Starved in babyhood, starved in childhood,
starved in manhood, such is their life’s epitome. No
wonder many are degraded into miserable creatures
of apathy, ignorance and disease, doomed to a slow
suicide by the community which refuses them a
fullness of life. No wonder many lie and thieve and
murder and prostitute their bodies. No wonder
their language is filthy and their few amusements
brutal and degraded.... The Government’s pretence
of social reform does not touch this misery, indeed
in some cases accentuates it by throwing the burden
of relief on the poor themselves, and in all cases ex-
acerbates it by creating a horde of meddlesome offi-
cials who worry and oppress. As for the Church,
although holding the platform of the nation and
having a splendid organisation, it is almost silent
on matters social. That clergymen can display
activity is seen by the fact that at a few days
notice 7000 attended the “Miracle.” But the
“miracle” of abolishing poverty is not for them.
Then he quotes the case of a married neigh-
bor, who earns a whole pound a week under
the Freetrade system :
He is in regular employment, as we understand
the phrase. He is married and has two children.
He and his wife are perpetually quarrelling over
mean and petty things, for one of the most dreadful
results of extreme poverty is the exacerbation of
temper caused by indigestion arising from eating
cheap adulterated food, living in dirt and squalor
and the thousand and one irritations of cramped
activities and unassuaged desres The lmpossi-
bUity of retaining one’s self-respect leads to such -a
degradation of the soul that the weaker cannot even
maintain the semblance of decent speech and con-
i >o,
as ssi-rrc tT r J£U sM
He must walk to work. If he rides the extravagance
b frit at home, and a “row” ensues, for his wife
will dock his bloater for tea.

This leaves him ten shillings and sevenpence with
which to purchase food, clothing, boots, beer, to-
bacco, etc., for himself, wife and children. Is it to
be Wondered at he “nags” at home, and that the
miserable drudge who rolls that Sisyphean sovereign
up the steep hill of life every week returns him
word for word.
And then this poor devil (if ever a devil was
so poor!) harks back to his own wretched
case, and tells the reader how he loves life: —
I could hold up my hands to the sunlight with
joy. I could sit in spring woods and listen to the
carolling of the birds with upliftment of heart. I
could watch gorgeous sunsets with that keen j'oy
which is akin to sadness. I feel within myself a
capacity for the highest pleasures of humanity, and
the knowledge that they are denied me fills the
misery of my life with acrid irony.
Apropriahsly enough, he ends his dirge on
the true frabellious note so abhorrent to Con-
stitooted Authority:—
Oh, people of England, the starving poor are in-
articulate, but woe unto you if they find voice, for
even a whisper from man to man gives courage, and
those who labor under a sense of unmerited wrong
care not whom they strike. Deep down in their
■ slums and alleys fester the vermin that gnaw at the
heart of Empire. Beneath the smiling vines of
Vesuvius seethes the lava that will shatter and de-
stroy. Awake, set your house in order', so that be-
fore external menace you can proudly point to the
strong limbs and cheerful faces of your children and
affirm in the face of the foe those incontestable
claims to continued Empire.
The man who can write like this says that
if he can manage to live on his wife and his
children until he is 70, he will get a pension
of ss. a week.

The Victorian Marine Board, like its
brother of Sydney, has adopted the Board of
Trade’s new life-saving regulations for the
equipment of ships. Sea-going vessels must
carry enough boats for all passengers, and
life jackets must be provided for all, a suffi-
cient proportion being of a size suitable for
children. Vessels plying in “Home-trade”
limits are, however, excused from carrying
boats to accommodate everyone; the de-
ficiency in that case may be made up by
life rafts, buoyant deck seats, chicken coops
and so on. As to the Bay excursion steam-
ships, lifeboats, buoyant deck fittings, etc.,
are to be sufficient to carry only 60 per cent,
of the total number of persons for which
the vessel is certified; on river and lake
boats it will be sufficient if 40 per cent, of
the passengers are provided for. The full
extent of the asininity of this regulation
need not be stressed except with the remark
that the main cargo carried by excursion
steamers on bays and lakes is women and
children. This cargo is usually packed
in a very enclosed space and is not given to
calm reflection when a collision or other
accident happens. It loses its head,
and throws its hairpin wildly at the sur-
rounding landscape. But even these
wretchedly inadequate rules are not allowed
to pass into existence without tribute to
dear old Private Enterprise. The cruellest
and most callous clause of all is that “ves-
sels launched before March 1, 1913,” are
only required to provide floating accommo-
dation for JfO per cent, in the case of Bay
steamers and 25 per cent, on lake and river
contraptions, until June 1, 1916. Thus the
Board, while admitting that the carrying of
extra lifeboats and apparatus is necessary,
is at the same time willing that women and
children should be exposed to calamity and
disaster for three years more. The new re-
gulations necessitate only “an increase of
one boat on three of the Bay excursion
steamers, viz., on the Courier, Ilygeia and
Weeroona”; but “if it is found not to be
practicable or reasonable to fit or place on
any such steamships the number of sets of
davits required by the regulations,” the
Board may vary the requirements. Great is
the mana of Private Enterprise, and much
is the variation of the requirements when it
is about.

“Melb” : Motor-’bus competition is making
the Melbourne Tram Co. sit up ; also the City
Corporation, which takes over the trams in
three years, and is likely to have a dead
horse to knack. The ’buses are clean, noise-
less, rapid. They go to St. Ivilda at 18 or
20 miles an hour, passing trams as trams
might pass bullock drays. The fare is the
same. The motor-’bus cos. have sneaked up
with amazing rapidity. Yesterday one ’bus
was a wonder. To-morrow they will be the
most familiar vehicles in the city. They
glide up to the kerbstone, and stop anywhere.
To reach the trams the passengers have to
negotiate the middle of the road. London
supplies a lesson —and a warning. Trams
were not allowed in London proper, or in part
of Westminster. All the immense area be-
tween Liverpool-street and Victoria-street
east and west, and between Westminster Em-
bankment and Oxford-street and Ilolborn, is
without trams. They were denied access to
London centre, to the theatre and res-
taurant districts of the West End, to
shopping places like Oxford-street, Regent-
street, Piccadilly and the Strand, to the busi-
ness quarters of St. Paul’s and the myriad
streets surrounding the Bank, filled with
offices and warehouses. Through all this
tram-prohibited area the motor-’buses now
rage. And of course they are on the tram-
routes, too. The County Council, which has
put £12,000,000 into trams, is in a hole, and
heavy losses are being made. No doubt the
Melbourne Corporation is differently cir-
cumstanced, but it looks as though its ex-
perience, too, will be disastrous. The pro-
blem before the County Council is that of
getting at the ’buses in the way of taxation;
and Melbourne will, in the near future, also
have that problem. Such considerations are
forcing on a movement for a proper munici-
pal federation of the whole city and suburbs,
for the motor-’bus is also an enemy of the
electric tram, which is spreading over Mel-
bourne outskirts.

Recently the Mangaweka (M.L.) Settler
had the temerity to charge the Massey
Government with indifference or something
to the increasing land aggregation in the
North Island. Also, it had the audacity to
remark that land aggregation was the
Devil’s grandmother. Naturally, the offi-
cial organ of the Government fled to the
front with a full defence, namely, that the
charge could not be correct, because the
Settler was a small and obscure news-
paper that would naturally know nothing
of such matters —which is much the same
as assuming that a giant must know more
geography and history than a dwarf, because
there is more of him. Strangely enough,
this failed to convince the small paper. It
might be only the size of a red ant, but it
was not safe to sit on. In fact, it merely
stirred itself to more furious remarks con-
cerning the land-grabbing wickedness. There-
abouts, the Auckland Star, one of M.L.’s
biggest newspapers, despatched an investiga-
tor to the scene of alleged operations; and
he backed the Settler with a long descrip-
tion of deserted farms and closed schools.
This caused the Government to forward a
civil servant to make a report, and, accord-
ing to him, all is well, or words to that
effect. But, the truth is, land aggregation
has been going on for years in M.L., during
Ward’s term of office as well as since.
Probably, however, the rich land-owners,
reckon Massey, their own man, will wink
twice where Joseph winked once. And
maybe he will. Massey has a great wink-
ing reputation.

A piffling dispute periodically capsizes a
section of Melbourne’s commercial apple-cart,
and the. Government appears to have no
glimmering of an idea as to how to deal with
it. It seems the Melbourne Stevedoring Co.
has a three-years’ agreement expiring next
November, with the Stevedores’ Laborers’
Association, under which all public holidays
are considered as overtime. Amongst these
holidays is the Prince of Wales’s birthday.
The M.S. Co. has also an “honorable under-
standing” with the Wharf Laborers’ Union,,
that its members are to assist the S.L.A..
when called upon and are to receive overtime,
pay when the others get it. After the agree-
ment with the S.L.A. was signed, the State.
Government abolished P.O.W. Birthday as
a public holiday, but the agreement to pay
overtime on that day was still kept. Last
year, however, the young man’s birthday fell
on a Sunday, when no lumping work is done 1
in . Melbourne; nevertheless, the S.L.A..
claimed overtime for all work done-
on the Monday following, which wouldl
have been a public holiday if Watu
and Co. had not abolished it as such.
The M. S. Co. refused the claim,
and, after much argument, P.M. Cohen was
persuaded to arbitrate. He decided against
the S.L.A., and that body accepted his deci-
sion. Just here, however, the Wharf
Laborers’ Union butted Into the business
with a remark that its claim for overtime
was just as strong as that of the S.L.A.;
that it hadn’t asked for arbitration, and
hadn’t been represented at the proceedings;
and, therefore, that it wouldn’t recognise
Cohen’s award. The M. S. Co. once more
refused to pay, so the Wharf Laborers’ Union
passed a resolution declining to work on any
future public holiday until the overtime rates
for the alleged public holiday already men-
tioned were paid. That resolution still
stands, and, in accordance with it no wharf
lumping was done in Melbourne on June 23 —
which wasn’t a public holiday, but is so con-
sidered in the S.L.A. agreement. As a re-
sult, the stevedores lost some £2OO last Mon-
day week, the laborers a similar sum, and
the M. S. Co. and the shipowners, merchants
and others concerned anything from £lOO to.
£lOOO or more. Can’t J. Weary or someone-
get firmly out of bed and do something?
The country members of the Vic. Assembly
seem to be preparing a warm reception 3<)r-
Premier Watt, on his return to Melbourne..
The spoilt kids of agriculture, as Sstate>
Governor Puller termed the farmers, are
wanting about five times as much Goivern-
ment assistance as the money can possibly
run to. They are especially yelling for roads
which they should have made for them-
selves long ago. Having got the earth, they
look to the Government to make it more
valuable. But, mingled with the demands of
unreasonable selfishness is the good national
cry for new ports and railways thereto.
Western farming interests in Victoria are
the State’s interests, and it is only the un-
blessed vested interests of bloated Melbourne
that are up against them. When Watt
returns to work he must tackle the question
of how to do all the things due to the spoilt:
children of agriculture, whilst compelling
them to pay for all the development of the l
country which is properly their own busi-
ness. Neither job is quite so easy as it:
looks. In the field of patriotic endeavor ai
Government usually stumbles over thei
boulders of political considerations. And ai
Government so individually weak as Watt’s;
crowd is bound to stumble hard.

“Spats and Lavender” : States’ Spites got
another chance during Sydney’s small-pox
scare, and, naturally, Premier Holman
seized it with 10 claws. To prevent the dis-
ease, or alleged disease, spreading beyond
New South Wales, the Australian Govern-
ment quarantined Sydney, which meant that
persons bound for Victoria, Queensland,
etc., had to be vaccinated before departure.
Holman, of course, saw occasion for ridicule
in this piece of carefulness, and made room
for it to be circumvented by declining to
take any action with regard to passengers
from the infected and quarantined area to
the country districts of the State. This ex-
posed the whole of the rural population to
the danger of contagion, it is true; but the
compensation lay in the fact that it also
undermined the national precautions. Thus,
there was, and is. nothing to prevent inter-
state passengers booking to Junee, Goulburn
or Albury, going south, or to Newcastle,
Tamworth or Glen Innes northward, and,
after an indecent interval, resuming their
journey. There may be nothing serious in
the outbreak of small-pox in Sydney. It
may not be small-pox at all; maybe it’s
chicken-pox or goose-measles. But it will
take up a good deal of Holman’s time and
cajolery to convince mere Australians that
that is his principal concern.

Consider the hopeless stodginess of Mel-
bourne’s City Council. That body, smarting
under the high price and low quality of its
privately-supplied street gas, and urged on
by a few departed progressives, took to sup-
plying itself and its constituents with elec-
tric light. That is some years ago, and the
Council has moved practically not one step
since then. It supplies a comparatively, few
city consumers—and that is about all. It
had a long start of the private octopus that
has laid its tentacles on almost every sub-
urb ; yet the latter concern has the field to
itself. The City Council doesn’t even sell to
its customers lamps, motors, stoves or ahy
sort of electrical appliance, and when re-
cently it was asked why it didn’t do the
same as municipal undertakings in England,
it replied, through its chairman, that it
“didn’t wish to interfere with nrivately-
owned firms.” “We are,” he said, “not a

private trading concern; our business is
carried on with the ratepayers’ money....
Private Enterprise has very large salaries to
pay, and we don’t think it a fair thing that
we.... should enter into competition with
the ratepayers themselves on their own
money.’’ When you grasp the hopeless habit
ot mind of a man who talks like that, you
understand why Melb. City Council has be-
come the laughing-stock and the despair of
municipal reformers. Would the public have
owned a railway if the Government hadn’t
entered into competition with the citizens
who owned bullock waggons? Would it
have had a sewerage system if the muni-
cipalities hadn’t entered into competition
with the Private Enterprise that once ran
the rubbish carts?
The stout man is supposed to be. as a
rule, a joyous man, but the scheme doesn’t
always work. Murray White, the Sydney
solicitor —at least he was a solicitor, then a
barrister, and then a solicitor again, and of
late he had no very great luck either way—
who lately cut his throat, was a stout man.
Melancholia was his trouble. Like most
amateurs he made rather a failure of the
business, and at time of writing lie was still
alive. The inexperienced throat-cutter
always tries to saw through his windpipe,
and that, is about the least vulnerable part
of the neck. The knowledgeable person makes
a flank attack on himself instead of rushing
at himself in front.
“Melb”: Viceroy Denman officiated the
other day at the opening of the fine new
Anglican schools of St. Peter’s, on Eastern
Hill, Melbourne. The old church is to be
knocked down, and many thousands ex-
pended on a new one. The very High
Church Canon Hughes, who rules here, is
strong in cash. He gives £lOO to the
school, and Mrs. Hughes gives £lOO. Per-
haps her purse furnished both. She was a
rich widow before she became an incum-
bent’s offsider.. St. Peter’s is 07 years old.
It was built in the forest, a little before
Bishop Perry landed from the shin Stag, and
that was about the time when Bishop Goold
came overland from Sydney in a four-horse
carriage.
Ihe fact that only about £15,000 worth
of the Federal ten-shilling notes have yet
got into circulation, shows that the boycott
put up by the private banks is pretty furi-
ous. But seeing that some bank officials
are reported, in the enormity of their bump-
tiousness, to refuse even to accent them in
the ordinary way of business, it might be
worth while to mention that the notes are
legal tender, and the person who bumps too
hard may fall in. And sometimes the per-
son who falls in is long in getting out.
The recent Labor Conference in Tas-
mania specially thanked Bishop Mercer and
rather T. J. O’Donnell for their efforts on
behalf of democracy. Mercer is known
throughout Australia, and O’Donnell de-
serves to be. A native of Vic., and just over
•-P years of age, he is an avowed Unifica-
tiomst, a good democrat, and a whole-hog
Protectionist. In the press, on the plat
form, or asking awkward questions of
husion candidates, lie was almost the core
of tile Labor movement in Northern Tas-
mania during the recent elections; and many
a good Derryite rolled up on polling day to
record a vote not against Labor so much as
against O’Donnell. In between elections he
makes provision for the future of his R.C.
flock, and does it strenuously. During the
first 12 months of his present charge he laid
the foundation-stones of three churches, and
was architect and clerk of works for at least
one of them.
Archbishop \\ right, of Sydney, returned
from foreign parts last week, and the S. M.
this to say in all seriousness
(7/7/ Id) on the subject:—
If his days in England were anything like Satur-
nay, the Archbishop must have been tremendously
busy. No sooner had the Niagara reached the wharf
than he answered the welcome greetings of scores of
enthusiastic Churchmen, rushed to a waiting auto-
mobile, was whirled to the Deanery, welcomed hur-
riedly by more prominent Anglicans, changed, con-
ducted a brief service in the Cathedral, changed
again, met a few more friends, vouchsafed a couple
cf pressmen a four-minutes’ interview, hurried to
the dining hall of the Deanery, was entertained at
dinner by the lay Canons of the Cathedral, delivered
a brief impromptu oration, hurried out to Bishops-
court, met more friends, and, later, had a survey of
the work that had been accumulating for the past
18 weeks.
The reporter’s glozing art gives a sort of
surface appearance of strenuousness or hustle
to the above. But, on analysis, it proves to
be a fairly typical day in the Vineyard—
that leisurely spot where it is practically
always afternoon tea. Put in plain terms,
the Archbishop shook hands with his friends
at the wharf; went to what one may call his
office; met the staff; did a few minutes’
work ; saw two pressmen for four minutes ;
dined, went home, shook hands with some
more friends; and had a look at the work
which he intends to do some time in the
future. Ninety-nine per cent, of shop
assistants in Sydney probably did more genu-
ine toil in the course of any given hour up
to 1 p.m. on Saturday, than the careering
Archbishop achieved between daylight and
dark on the same day of semi-rest.

J. C. Williamson died in Paris on Sunday
last. He had been ailing for a long time,
and his performance of “Kerry,” the old
Irish butler, at the Scott matinee, just
before he left for Europe, was a
tour de force of pluck as well as of acting.
It is just on 40 years since he first arrived
in Australia with “Struck Oil.” After a
hiatus of a few years, during which he was
occupied by the agency of the classic above-
mentioned, tearing thousands of pounds off
the peoples of America, Canada and Britain
—aided and abetted therein by the im-
perishable Maggie Moore —he returned to
Australia. lie has been instrumental, since
then, in giving this country a taste of almost
every conceivable form of dramatic art. A
list of the stars, great, good, mediocre and
utterly rotten that he imported to Aus-
tralia in his time would fill columns of The
Bulletin. Among those in the first cate-
gory may be cited Bernhardt. H. B.
Irving, Margaret Anglin, Ethel Irving.
Genee, Brough, Boucieault, Titheradge,
Asche, Waller, and Tith’s astonishingly
gifted daughter, Madge. It is a great re-
cord. His notorious distrust of the local
dramatist, or rather, of the local pub-
lic’s interest in the local dramatist’s
efforts, never extended to the local player.
He gave the glad hand to one promising
Australian performer after another, and the
fact that the majority of the musical
comedy artists who are appearing in the
Commonwealth to-day are of indigenous
extraction is largely due to him. His em-
ployees have a thousand stories to tell of his
fair-mindedness. approachableness, and
kindliness. When it is remembered
that a great theatrical manager is
constantly being harried by emotional
folk who are in agonies of desDair because
their parts have been cut down ; or because a
rival has been preferred to them; or because
they are to appear in Perth instead of in
Brisbane, or vice versa; or because they have
been cited in a breach-of-promise suit, or
“AUTUMN
MANCEUVRES,"
AT SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY'S .
The crusty Colonel (William Lockhart) fumes
at the impossible comedy captain (Phil Smith).
wnttcd for debt, or served with a garland
ot divorce documents—when, in short, it is
recalled that the everyday existence of a big
theatrical manager is about the most trying
one lmaginabie, it is something to be able
tiuthtully to say of one of the tribe that he
never let his nerves get frayed ; never acted
hastily or -ill-temperedly; never even
dreamed, seemingly, of shooting one of the
complainmg stars, or performing other deeds
ot violence. This tribute can honestly be
laid on the shrine of .T. C. Williamson. He
was os when he died, having been born in
1 ennsylvania in 1845. He leaves a wife and
two children (girls) ; also a vast army of
sorrowing friends in every city in the Com-
monwealth who hold him in remembrance.
"Autumn Manoeuvres,” the military show
in which Miss Florence Young sings like a
well-nourished angel; while Phil Smith
evokes the laughter that is but a paddock or
so away from tears; and Miss Dorothy
Brunton looks distractingly lovely, and
Talleur Andrews incredibly gloomy and ro-
mantic, continues to draw with immense
traction power at Her Majesty’s, Sydney.
By the way, the writer, in his remarks last
week about this entertainment, forgot to
mention Julius Roscius, who bounds from
the ranks of the Territorials and sings a
tenor song on the subject of the Arrrmy.
He is great.
The Limited Overland Express starts
from the prompt side of Sydney Criterion
next Friday evening for Brisbane, all pas-
sengers having previously been vaccinated.
Those Sydney individuals who have not yet
made the acquaintance of Fred Niblo and
his fine company of fellow-passengers in
“Excuse Me” are advised to purchase their
tickets at once-
Apparently the Sydneyites who haunt the
Little Theatre take with equal avidity to
Shaw and to the modern American comedy,
since “Bobby Burnit” has been almost as
great a popular success as “Fanny’s First
Play.” Whether this shows intelligence or
mere affability the writer does not know, but
he suspects that the Little Theatre has
become a habit with playgoers. On Monday
week, however, Arnold Bennett is likely to
become a habit, since this English drama-
tist’s latest success, “The Great Adventure,”
is the next Little Theatre production.
“Man to Man,” the last of the series of
four Billanderson bellowdramas, eventuated,
at Sydney Adelphi, to the accompaniment
of the minimum of blood stains, on Satur-
day night, and threatens to go on eventuating
every evening for a fortnight. The producer
didn’t find it necessary to go beyond the
theatre to get anything he needed for the
play. Everything was there just as numer-
ous Marlowdramas had left it—the will,
showing unmistakable signs of wear and
tear; the villain’s top hat, grown shiny
with constant rubbing; and the revolver,
which only needs to be told to go off, and
it goes off. Though it is an improvement
on previous attempts, the gap isn’t very
large. If each bellowdrama were miles ahead
of the preceding one, Perfection would be
reached much too soon, and after that there
would be a dead wall, and melodamners and
others would be thrown out of work, and
there would be riots, and shattered marriage-
ties, and high prices and general ruin. In
“Man to Man” the chief items of interest
are a railway accident and a corner in the
Portland Prison quarries, which latter scene
includes a conflict and an escape in a fog.
Fortunately the three principals are not
re-captured, otherwise Adelphi patrons
would get only about three-penn’orth for
their money. The two outstanding char-
acters are Olive Wilton, a gipsy fortune-
teller, and Charles Brown, a convict with a
touch of humor. Vera Remee isn’t called
upon to do excessive toil as the heroine, but
she plays the part convincingly, and Max
Clifton puts plenty of feeling into his share
as her lesser half. Rutland Beckett sup-
plies the necessary villainy to keep things
moving.
David Bispham, returning from his brief
concert seasons in Melbourne and Adelaide,
makes three so-long appearances at Sydney
Town Hall on Thursday, Friday and Satur-
day of this week. Then “Freddy” Shipman,
Bispham’s manager, will settle down to his
preparations for the Nordica campaign,
which opens at the end of. the month. The
great American soprano arrives on the 21st,
and with her will be Paul Dufault, the
Canadian tenor, who came last year with
Cisneros and speedily overshadowed that
majestic lady.
The doors of Sydney Royal, at present
shut in the face of the public, will be dashed
open on Saturday evening, when Lewis
Waller and Madge Titheradge begin their
Australian tour with “Henry V.,” the
Shakesbacon play in which the late George
Rignold used to compel the worship of
hardened playgoers.
The Butt-Rumford farewell matinee to
the vaccinated city of Sydney happens to-
day (Thursday), at the Town Hall. Satur-
day night’s concert drew a full house, and
when Clara sang Elgar’s “Land of Hope
and Glory,” and waved a small Union Jack,
the audience rose and applauded, regardless
of its sore arm, its biled shirt-front, its
osprey, its string of pearls, and its rimless
gold eyeglasses—the frail things that perch
precariously like an Alpine climber on the
bridge of the nose and have life-lines fixed
behind the wearer’s ear. Ivennerle.v Rum-
ford scored one of his biggest hits with
Alfred Hill’s delightful poi song. William
Murdoch earned the usual allowance of
cheers for himself at the piano. And vio-
linist Mowat Carter cunningly drew three
pints of the golden wine of dreams with his
accomplished bow.
Manager Ben Fuller is keeping up his
reputation at the National as a good show-
man, Benjamin reckons that his programme
this week is as good as, if not better than,
any other thing of its kind in Sydney. And
Benjamin ought to know. He is the man
on the spot.
“Quo Vadis” is still the question of the
Christians at Sydney Lyceum picture show,
and Caesar’s lions are providing the answer
as usual. West’s principal attraction is
the English Derby, recently run. That was
the race in which a misguided young person
argued the vote-for-women question with
George Y.’s horse. George V.’s horse voted
“No.” Yet the beast had no vote himself.
Some day, long after women have got the
vote, the horse may butt into the contro-
versy, and refuse to drag the ton of coals
uphill any more unless he is recognised as
a moke and a brother, and allowed to come
into the drawing-room at night and con-
verse with the family. And afteT that will
come the revolt of the machines, when
the locomotive develops a soul the over-
worked steam crane acquires a mind and
grows angry. And after that will come
chaos. Subsequent to chaos there will be
nothing but slag, and dead silence, and utter
blackness.

For the second time within the memory
of the oldest inhabitant. Lillie Langtry, the
“electric spark,” dropped into Sydney last
week, the Tivoli being her location. This
writer didn’t see her last time; but if she
did earn her title then, she has fused since.
With the exception of a Scotch song and a
pretty dance, her turn is reminiscent of a
trial-night for aspiring amateurs. In other
respects the programme is much the same as
it was last week —very bright in most re-
spects, and more so in the cases of the Ban-
vards, Lucy Gillet. Cummin and Seahan, the
Ilavilans and Billie Reeves.

“The Power of the Cross,” at Sydney
Crystal Palace, is a film warranted to make
the most hopeless Wowser dash off and sign
the pledge. It is the usual drunk yarn
served up brightly. Max Linder supplies
the humorous portion of the programme
with a cheerful film described as “Pancakes.”
There is not much that is new to be said
about “The Grafters” at Sydney Palace, but
it may be mentioned in passing that “the
free list is suspended entirely.” So, at
least, the advertisement declares. And
when the free list is scragged wholly, and
suspended completely by the neck till it is
dead, and generally treated as Dennis of
“Barnaby liudge” used to treat his clients,
the _ inference is that William Andersen is
feeling good and profitable. Yet this paper
desires to remonstrate.. Suspension is a
clumsy sort of business at best. Couldn’t

The obstinately fine weather in South
Australia, which, so far, will not give way
before either forecasts or prayers, is bad for
the State, but good (pro tem.) for Adelaide
shows, and the comic opera people are having
a great season at the Royal. Leslie Hol-
land gave an accentable rendering of Ichabod
Bronson, but seemed glad to get back to his
own manner in “The Quaker Girl.” Into the
latter play was also dropped Higginson—
curiously quiet and subdued since the “Merry

GENEE SEASON AT HER MAJESTY’S,
MELBOURNE.
That dashing youth, Volinin.
At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) the Genee
season hardly needed another fillip, seeing
that the first programme —now that Genee’s
hunting dance closes it with a snap —is mak-
ing a fine advt. for itself. Nevertheless a
change is promised for next Saturday,
and the last nights of “Coppelia,” and the
Divertissements, and the operetta “Suzanne”
are announced. People who miss see-
ing these things deserve to be charged double
for the next lot. Where there was any
room for improvement on the earliest per-
formances it has been made. The orchestra
gives more expression to the operetta and to
Offenbach’s Barcarolle and the ballet accom-
paniments. The dancers are in great form,
and the solos which fetched most applause
on the first night are vociferously
encored three times. For next Saturday the
special attraction is “Les Sylphides,” in
which Chopinesque dream of white muslin
and poetic limbs Genee will be associated
with adorable Ilalina Schmolz as well as
A T olinin and the Russian Ballet.
“Within the Law” has passed its 50th
performance at Melbourne Royal without
betraying any signs of wanting to make its
get-away.

Melbourne Bijou was re-opened on Satur-
day by Carrie Moore and co. with a new and
exaggerated perversion of an antique far-
cical comedy, known as “The Arabian
Nights,” which Brough and Boucicault pre-
sented on the same stage 21 years ago. In
its present disguise it travels as “Much
Married.” Its original three short acts are
prolonged with song and dance items, which
Sydney Grundy, the , original author, never
dreamed of ; but the names of the characters
remain unaltered, and in between the inter-
polated varieties the farce is much the same
that Grundy devised for a bygone age. The
inane husband who tells lies, the wife who
trusts him, the mother-in-law who doesn’t,
the wild girl from the music-halls who plays
up with his domestic circle in the borrowed
capacity of niece, and two or three other
relatives and friends, are the characters, and
the irrelevant vaudeville turns are the
things that largely assist to make it go.
Carrie Moore, as the wild intruder, is as-
sisted by half a dozen people, mostly cap-
able, who can all sing a little or shake a
lively leg. The crudest member of the co.
Miss Maisie Bell —has a bright soprano voice
and a pleasing young personality. Maud
Chetwynd is a comic-opera chambermaid in
silk stockings ; Enid Bowman makes a P re tt.v
bom fide niece ; the men comedians, headed
by Brandon Cremer, are up to their
work, although one of them carries too
much weight for the conventional dude.
Kathleen Arnold is a comparatively pleasing
mother-in-law. and Carrie Moore justifies the
audacity of this experimental show.

into the -family group, and Uncle Rudd, who
is said to do no work, but appears to have
quite as much toil on his hands as the casual
Maloney and the rest of them—all these
people are established subjects for artless
glee. Even the invisible neighboring matron,
whose baby gets,fed with worms by a mis-
guided magpie, is a recognised fact. She
exists, like Bodger, the unseen baker in “Sil-
ver King.” “On Our Selection” has
made good. It contains sufficient plot
to carry the typical Australian humor, and
the humor is sufficiently robust to support
the plot when it gets tired. Moreover, the
performance has improved. The only changes
from the first' cast are the new Kate (Miss
Oakley) and a youthful Billy Bearup (Gor-
don White), who looks the character, which
his matured predecessor did not. Dad, Dave,
Joe, Lily, Maloney, the Careys and Cranky
Joe are as before, or even better; and Sarah,
in the hands of Miss Laura Roberts, con-
tinues to be just It.

“Spanish Blood” was the feature at Mel-
bourne Olympia on Saturday, and Asta Niel-
sen, the senorita who played the enchantress.
Asta’s task was to fascinate and embroil
two champion toreadors, with a degraded
taste for secret murder, and she did the job.
“The One Good T urn” was a good second
to the, main production, while the star
“travel” item was “The Northern Games,”
showing how the Swede keeps warm in
winter, when even the bear feels cold, and
wraps his tail miserably around him.
Tiebor’s seals are still first favorites in the
menagerie department of Melbourne Opera
House, though Torcat’s fowls continue to
give an interesting demonstration of the
fact that they can be something more than
instigators of the breakfast egg. The human
element will presently lose some of its im-
portance by the departure of Miss Clair
and the Bellclair Bros. On Saturday, how-
ever, the bill will be improved by the addi-
tion of Miss Lucy Gillet, described as the
greatest lady juggler on the globe. Long
may she jug.
THE LATE J. C. WILLIAMSON.
His youngest known portrait. (THE BULLE-
TIN presents this because almost every other
paper has shown his oldest portrait.)
Melbourne Repertory Co. had one of its
unsuccessful evenings at the Athenaeum last
Thursday, when it staged Maeterlinck s In-
terior,” Sudermann’s “Fritzchen and
Shaw’s “How He Lied to Her Husband.
The first-named was somewhat teebly per-
formed. The youth who played the grand-
pa croaked the part depressingly, and sundry
people had evidently acquired their notions
of humble peasant attire at a fancy-dress
ball “Interior” is melancholy stuff toi
amateurs to tamper with. It lacks irony
and tragic force, and only the flunkeys of
Literature would pretend to see anything
more in it than Maeterlinck s morbid exalta-
tion of the fact that “in the midst of life
we are in death.” “Fritzchen is a gloomy,
though more entertaining production, con-
aS matter for tumult in the principal
character, who auddccly becomes conscious
his precious honor after he nas oeen
walloped for canoodling with another mans
wife. Alan Mitchell played this unhealthy
freak of German upbringing. Mrs. Alfred
Cornish was his worshipping ma. F. B.
Reeves was his worldly-wise pa. Miss Lilian
Prichard strove to model her Agnes accord-
ing to the panting, emotional school of
Tittell Brune. ‘‘How He Lied to Her Hus-
band ’ was the last on the bill,' and the
change was akin to leaving the cemetery for
the circus. The bright and cheerful trifle
was enacted by Miss Louie Dunne as
Aurora, Gerald Carr as the poet, and F. B.
Reeves as the husband. Carr was the best
of the trio, and his idea of Henry Apjohn
had much that was acceptable about it.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The offer made by Farmers’, of Sydney, of £lOO
for the person who writes them the best national
anthem should be right into the hands of Poverty
Pointers. This paper has never encountered one of
the tribe that didn’t think he could write a better
song, lyric, ballad, topical imbecility, march, dirge,
chaunt,, medley, duet or chorus than anyone on
earth if only given the time, place, opportunity, sub-
ject, ink and a few other bare essentials. A 20-line
anthem should amply satisfy Farmers’ literary judge,
as regards space. That would work out at a fiver a
line—say, 20 drinks per word. Kipling does little
better than this in his most affluent moments.
“Norbell” : A well-known touring manager is busy
just now trying to persuade himself that virtue is
its own reward. If it isn’t, he reckons he is a few
pounds to the bad. For a couple of years past he
had been promising; a benefit for the Bulli (N.S.W.
South Coast) Hospital, and he recently fulfilled his
promise. He sent his company, scenery and impedi-
menta to Bulli for a two nights’ season. The
entire proceeds of the first night’s performance were
for the hospital, and they ran to over £3O. The
second night was to cover expenses, if possible, and
the hospital was to get the surplus, if any. Over
the first night a grateful committee made complimen-
tary speeches. The second night a large and en-
thusiastic audience, stayed at home in its tin humpy
with remarkable unanimity, and less than £1 was
tendered at the doors. There were no complimentary
speeches, and the entertainment was abandoned. It
wasn’t such a bad show, either. In fact, I was play-
ing a leading part myself, and Sarah Bernhardt isn’t
a patch on me. In proof whereof I would point out
that she has never dared to appear before the critical
audience of Bulli, and I have.
“Theorbo”: Apropos “fancy” names on stage and
platform, note that Melba, celebrating her 25th Lon-
don anniversary, declares she is sorry she didn’t
stick to her true name. But whether she wishes she
had called herself Mitchell or Armstrong we don’t
know. Augustus Harris was her great friend, and
appears to have persuaded her to dub herself Melba
before her Brussels debut. In that era Foley became
Foli, and O’Gorman blossomed into Gormani, and Bill
Green into Guglielmo Verdi, and if there had been a
John Smith he would have become Johannes Smith-
ianus or else Ivan Smithoff. Nowadays M’Cormack
refuses to become Oormacci, and is sensible. As
Mrs. Armstrong Melba sang for a good while in the
choir of St. Francis’s, Melbourne, without drawing
particular notice. But the greatest streak of ill-luck
was the financial failure of her concert tour with
Kruse, the great Australian violinist. Her age is
anything you like from 50 to 54.
From London: Church and stage seem to be getting
on very nicely in latter-day Babylon. The Bishop
of London has been presiding over the annual dinner
in connection with the General Theatrical Fund, and
a brother prelate, Bishop Boyd-Carpenter, was among
the speakers. His Gaiters confessed to going to the
theatre once a week. The theatre, he said, “takes a
man out of himself.” Gin did the same, but the
theatre did it better. As for recent shows, his
Gaiters marked out three for special approbation:
Oscar Wilde’s “Importance of Being Earnest,”
Jerome’s “Passing of the Third Floor Back,” and
Arnold Bennett’s “Milestones.”
“H. 0.” : The recent forc ble kissing of the Batten-
burg princeling by some Maori damsels recalls an
occasion when the present occupant of the throne
was more kissed against than kissing. It happened
at the Adelaide Royal, during George’s youthful visit
to these parts with brother Clarence. A Govern-
ment House party gave an amateur performance of
“Caste,” with a professional stiffening in the form
of Myra Kemble as Esther Eccles and Julia Merton
as the Marquise. George D’Alroy, by the way, was
played by Captain Fitzroy. After the show, cham-
pagne ran freely, and the professionals were brought
forward to receive the royal blessings. Myra is
alleged to have shaken the elder Clarence heartily
by the hand and told him he was like his mamma,
and to have hugged and kissed the younger George
what time she informed him that he was “a naughty
boy” and “the living image of his grandma.” It
was good luck for George. In those days any male
person might have thought it a privilege to be kissed
by Myra K.
“Stargazer”: Gen fie is wonderful, petite, piquant
fluid. Her limbs flow. There is not an angle in her
charming agility. Every action is rounded, suave,
subtle and her activity is amazing. The younger
dancer, Ilalina Schmolz, has physical advantages
and a great pull in the matter of years, wherefore
many Melbourne people are disposed to place her
first in their affections; but, although a superfine
dancer, with the languorous grace of cigarette smoke
on a still day, she has far to go, on her Mel-
bourne showing, before she attains Genre’s marvel-
lous versatility, absolute perfection of technique, and
the unequalled diversity of steps displayed by the
elder artiste. Then Gen6e has a unique personality.
When such a personality goes with remarkable talent,
triumph is inevitable; and Genre’s gift is not talent
merely—it is genius.
Frances Ross is going to America to find the en-
gagements which are hard to get in Australia. So
it goes without saying that Bland Holt s long-time
leading lady is to have a farewell benefit of befitting
magnitude. It was originally arranged for the
King’s, but the Williamson firm volunteered the loan
of the Royal for a matinee, and the name of Miss
Ross being identified with the old home of Bland
Holt melodrama, she accepted the complimentary
offer. The event will happen on the 31st inst., with
an attractively made-up bill.
“Booshee”: Died last week the old campaigner
who was Harry Percival Lyons to some, Harry Lyons
to many, and “H.P.” to just a few. I met H.P.
first in Melbourne, when he was managing Blon-
din* afterwards in Calcutta, with the Stewait Fam-
ily ;’ in Dunedin, with Lyons’s Tourists ; in Bombay,
with the Taylor-Carringtons; in Canton, with Carl
Hertz; and in Adelaide, a few months ago, with
Tokio Town. He was a model “advance man” —
honest, hard-working, shrewd and experienced. With
regard to his honesty I remember Dick Stewart —not
young Dick, but the father of Our Nell—telling me
many years ago that H.P. wouldn’t rob his manager
of even a postage stamp ; and as Dick Stewart had
had H.P. half round the world with him in the
days of “Rainbow Revels” and “If,” and was a very
shrewd business man, I looked upon that as very
high praise. His virtues were many, his vices few.
And if in the world to come the lives we lead are
akin to those we worry through down here, H.P.’s
devoted old wife will resume the duties she took such
delight in, and once again see him off by the train ;
and while he is putting his bill-box in the guard’s-van
she will secure for her lifelong pal the most comfort-
able seat available; unroll his rugs, spread out his
newspapers and see that his flask is full and his
tiffin basket right.
“Petramos” : It grieves me to see so few actors in
gaol. Swagmen, tailors, butchers, sailors, bricklayers
and jockeys possess the happy knack of murdering ;
GENEE SEASON AT
HER MAJESTY'S,
MELBOURNE.

of the orchestra.
commercial travellers

taries embezzle ; may-
ors, considering their
numbers, break into
gaol with charming
i n s i s t e ncy. Even
poets commit Suicide,
and hotel-keepers burst
forth into bigamy
But the actor is a
poor thing. On the
stage he will rob the
orphan of a million
pounds and stab his
rich uncle with splen-
did dash. Off the
stage he can do no-
thing more dastardly
than the borrowing of
a quid—which, to
make matters worse,
he intends to pay
baqk. Murder, arson,
robbery with violence
and forgery are com-
mon on the stage,
where any actor can
do the lot naturally.
The borrowing of a
sovereign from a rich
uncle, on the other
hand, is a most in-
frequent occurrence in
plays, and an inci-
dent which only an
actor with the strong-
est imagination could
portray successfully. The
borrowing actor would,
of course, know that
the rich uncle was not
really a rich uncle,
but merely another
actor. He would,
therefore, have no
heart for the job. I pro-
pose that murder be
made a petty offence,
and death be the penalty for borrowing or attempted
borrowing. Most of the actors who are not hanged
for borrowing will be shot down by audiences which
have long suffered in silence. This will tend to
drive the surviving actors into professions more ad
dieted to crime, and help to solve the problem of
our empty gaols.
“Dumper”: Concerning “Vagabond’s” cry from
London for some real Australian picture films (B.
3/7/’l3), it may be some satisfaction to hm to
know that his prayer will be answered. The firm
that did “Whaling in Jervis Bay” (mentioned re-
cently in The Bulletin) some time ago exported
the negative of its first drama, “A Blue Gum
Romance,” and word comes that London will take
it. This picture, though the action is out-of-doors,
has no riding to speak of in it. But in a second
attempt, “The Jaekeroo,” the producers have got on
to the American idea and put in plenty of horse.
This negative is also to be sent to London. Apart
from local work, the Melies (American) Co., which
toured these parts recently, is now releas'ng in New
York a series of Australian dramas. 'The outdoor
work was done here, the indoor work in the co.’s
home studio. Australia certainly ought to be pro'-
ducing dozens of pictures off its own bat, so to
speak : but foreign stuff of all kinds eomes in duty
free, and the local goods ave drowned in the flood.
Except in the very rarest cases the prices are so low
that it absolutely doesn’t pay to produce an Aus-
tral’an film unless the producer can find a foreign
market to eke out the trifle he gets for his home-
made goods in Australia.
“Hullo” : The cult of the marionette seems spread-
ing. Shaw, Chesterton and Anatole France go into
raptures over the tiny puppets, and Gordon Craig and
Yeats are fascinated by their experiments with the
puppet theatre. The Petit Theatre in Brussels has
just been opened for marionette drama. The present
scribe has seen only one marionette turn at the
Tivoli, and the daintiness, the grace and the expres-
siveness of the tiny dolls gave him something that
he somehow missed in Oscar Asche and Ethel Irving.
Bruce Smith has declined the Speakership
of the House of Reps., and that about ends
Prime Minister Cook’s majority. Bruce
Smith in the Chair would have been present,
but Private Member Smith is about the most
chronic absentee who ever stayed away. Cook
made his first blunder when he failed to
rush madly at Smith with a portfolio in each
hand.
Dead, at an early age, E. H. Montgomery,
Maoriland’s ambassador in New South
Wales. As a journalist in the north of
M.L., he marked himself well above the pos-
sibles offering for the important post in
Sydney that he has now vacated. For some
years he was the much-harassed, but un-
complaining, head of the big colony of
Maorilanders in the Ma State. In his spare
time he did odd jobs for Masseyland that
kept his mind ceaselessly employed until
the Old Enemy reckoned rest was a fair
thing. It was his heart that gave out —so
report has it. Certainly it wasn’t his head.

ONE PENNY.
ONE penny:
IT SEEMS A FAILURE.
Mr. Bertram Mackennal’s design for the new
2s. 6d. and 6s. stamps has been printed on the line-
engraving principle, and has been greatly admired.
The new design represents Britannia guiding three
sea-horses with the King’s head in the top left-hand
corner.
We are still of the opinion, however, that
our own original (rejected) design is an easy
winner.
When the police broke into one of Mel-
bourne’s smartest caf6s the other day, just
after Saturday night had merged into Sun-
day morning, there was one eminent gentle-
man, whose name they did not get. As the
avalanche of constables struck the dining-
room, a ready waiter shepherded him into the
kitchen. There the terrified celebrity, dis-
guised in a white jacket, an apron and a
cook’s cap, was diligently stirring a copper
of soup or dish-water or something hot when
the police thrust inquisitive noses into the
culinary department. If that vast cataract
of cop. ever learns what a prize it missed it
will tear its own helmet in its fury.
“Lex”: The Thring nullity suit of last
week was the first that has been heard in
open court for more years than the most
doddering inhabitant of the British Empire
can remember. Until the Privy Council
judgment of a few weeks back, which de-
cided that all suits must be capable of ven-
tilation in the public press, nullity cases were
heard in camera, as a matter of course. The
Sydney papers—or at any rate the evening
ones —took the fullest advantage of the new
arrangement; so much so that the divorce
Judge is likely to drop a hint, not to say
issue instructions, in the next affair of the
kind, as to what is to be laid before the
public and what is to be withheld. The
Judge has this power, regardless of any
Privy Council decision. Thus the late Judge
Walker, when sitting in divorce, was accus-
tomed to direct the rigid bowdlerization of
evidence in mere ordinary allegations of
misconduct. There is something illogical
about a community which toils untiringly
to suppress Chidley and his weird views on
the question of how to be happy though bare-
legged, while allowing the press full license
to print the most hair-raisingly intimate of
medical details in a divorce matter. By
the way, nullity suits in which the husband
is the petitioner are about the rarest things
in law. And yet, many married
women—unless the doctors lie, or unless the
ladies themselves lie to the doctors —suffer
from a physiological condition known as
dispar una. To such unfortunates a mere
friendly kiss is abhorrent. Despite which
they may be devoted to their husbands as
companions. Several doctors of repute have
put it to the writer that fully 40 per cent,
of married women take this view of the
wedded state. If it be so it mav account,
to a certain extent, for the fact that in
about 40 per cent, of divorce cases the wife
is the petitioner. It may also explain
Society’s immemorial tolerance of the wan-
dering husband. There is a kind of rough,
instinctive, unanalytieal justice about the
practices of Society, when all is said and
done.

Once more, though the discolored man is
our brother, we have let him know that he
can’t be our brother-in-law. The matter
arose at the Australasian Conference of
Methodists, held in Brisbane. The Confer-
ence runs various missions in the Pacific
Islands, most of them manned by natives,
many of whom are trained and ordained
ministers. The question was whether these
“brethren” should be brethren right out, or,
so to speak, only half-brothers. When it is
merely talking in a large, vague way, the
Conference is quite sure that these fine
fellows should be brothers ; but when it came
to a question in which the white parson’s
own ,iob or pay was at stake, then the Con-
ference decided that the discolored person
couldn t be even a Jrd brother. In fact,
he couldn’t then be any sort of relative at
ail, but must be a stranger and wait out on
the mat. And, naturally, the man who led
the opposition was a boss white-missionarv
from the Islands themselves, who “was
strongly averse to native ministers receiving
the privileges of white ministers.” He
Knows the nigger. The other man usually
only knows what he has been told by some
fatuous old party who doesn’t know any-
thing.

“0.K.”: The scandalous thing about
the police raid on two or three Mel-
bourne restaurants in the wee sma’
hours was that it took so long to
come about. The prosecution of two
particular lawbreakers had seemed inevitable
because a number of rival restaurants were
kept in danger of being “potted” if they
ventured any liberty with the licensing law
as regards closing time. As for the alleged
selling of liquor at first hand, rather than
second hand, by the managers of first-class
fooderies, public opinion is in favor of
licenses being granted to all restaurants
where a lot. of food is cooked and eaten and
a lot ot drink, under present conditions, is
fetched in from the pub. If a grocer can
get a license to sell anything and everything
in a bottle which is uncorked outside the
premises, why in the name of Reason are
restaurant-keepers not licensed to serve their
own drinks with meals? Under the present
Act the most absurd anomalies are per-
mitted. For example, an old pub at the
corner of Lonsdale and Exhibition streets
delicensed a while ago in the interests
ot public morality, and the owner of the
property was compensated for his loss. Then,
under the Act, a grocer’s license was granted
to. the occupant of the same premises, and
wine, beer and spirits are sold there by the
quart. Obviously some of the licenses taken
away from undesirable drinking shops should
be transferred to the expensive eating shops
which are now supposed to fetch their cus-
abottl eS from ad J acent pubberies.
Everybody who wants a drink gets it The
community is not made more sober by the
denying of licenses to these luncheon, dinner
and supper resorts. Nothing is gained ex-
cept a large output of bottles by the drink-
ing shops that supply the restaurants, and
an occasional raid by the police to discover
whether the restaurants are not unlawfully
supplying themselves. y
AN OLD GAG VARIED.
MILKO (cheerfully): “Nice rain we ’ad last
night !”
CUSTOMER (sarcastically): “So I see."
“J. 0.8.”: On July 1 the Australian
navy took possession of Garden Island, the
repairing depot in Sydney Harbor, and the
marines, after over a century of occupation,
were paid off and will return to England.
Why the place was called Garden Island
was a puzzle even in Sydney’s early days.
Judge Dowling tackled the question as far
back as 1829, but the only conclusion he
could reach was that it was so called because
no four-footed beast could get on to it.
Every other piece of unfenced land in the
city at that time was over-run by goats.
Governor King appropriated the speck in
1792 as a place of recreation for the officers
and men of the Lady Nelson, and there may
have been some idea of turning it into a
pleasure ground. But its history has been
variegated. It has even been a burial
ground. The bodies of some of the tyrants
and victims of the System are stowed away
there, and the dust of many aborigines lielns
the vegetation.

An old Sydney relic was discovered while
excavations were being made the other day
for the basement of a building near Waters’
corner, in King-street. At a depth of 10ft.
below the present level of the street the
workmen found a pipe 16ft. long, made of
a solid piece of hardwood, in circum-
ference, with a 3Jin. bore through the centre,
juie original tenant of the N.E. corner of
King and George streets was Captain
Kent, of the 102nd Regiment, who got the
ground in 1799 from Governor Hunter.
In 1834, when Kemp’s successor, W. H.
Moore, cut up and sold the allotment, the
title deeds gave the starting point in King-
street as from “the public pump.”
The pipe just found was, in all probability,
part of the equipment of this old “public
pump.”

The lOU Dreadnought has completed
the round trip of Maoriland ports. Owing
to the continued bad weather—when it is
not bad in Maoriland it is mostly worse-
the ship could only enter a few ports. At
the others it merely reared up, and, from a
distance, waved its 12-inch guns at the
assembled patriots. For this the Boys of
the Bulldog breed were not altogether sorry,
as their time ashore was not all joy and
beer. During the visit to Nelson, a section
of the Cold Tea brigade organised a tea-fight
and invited 200 of the crew. Grown wise
with experience, not a man offered to go
and it was left to the officers to draft out
200. As the martyrs on whom the lot bad
fallen were rowed ashore, the Wowsers
dressed in what they meant for smiles of
welcome, stood round like the demons wait-
ing at Charon’s ferry. For days after the
sailors wore the depressed look of the man
who has poisoned his rich mother-in-law’s
favorite pug and been found out
“0.K.”: Interesting
to read Victoria’s
leading organs . of
Fusion on the question
of nationalising the
medical profession in
the interests of hu-
manity. The Age had
no trouble in showing
that the protected
practice of medicine
has thus far always
been anti-Socialistic
(outside of the free
hospitals) and self-
seeking, in so far that
physicians and sur-
geons find means of
supporting themselves,
as expensively as they
can, in the treatment
of diseases, not in the
prevention of them.
Therefore enlightened
common sense will
surely demand, pre-
sently, that medical
men shall be salaried
public servants, and
the Public Health De-
partment of every
State Government
shall deserve its title.
Thus the Liberal Pro-
tection organ of Fu-
sion. But naturally
the Conservative Free-
trade journal scoffed
at this idea. The
Argus solemnly
warned its readers
that the medical pro-
fession would go to
the Devil if it were
deprived of the neces-
sary anti-social force
of good old Private
Enterprise. Sick
people would go groan-
ing to their graves for
want of the “best”
possible advice, be-
cause the “best” men couldn’t be in-
duced to practise medicine and sur-
gery at a salary of £l2OO a year (or
more, in some cases). Strange to say,
neither of the Ministerial organs touched
upon the crying need for nationalisation of
the trained nursing profession. The. cure
of patients’ bodies is more in the care of
nurses than doctors admit, or the public is
aware of. Moreover, it is nurse who freely
gives the advice re prevention of
sickness, which the doctor —the man doctor
—is so chary of imparting. The lady
doctors —to give them their due—are more
ready with “stitch-in-time” . information.
Every woman is at heart a nurse.

The Wowsers have broken out now in
the Riverina townships, the subject of their
crusade being that awful iniquitv, Sunday
sport. The football that has been played
by the youth on the outskirts of the town-
ship, miles away in some cases from church
or chapel, has been absolutely prohibited.
Tennis has suffered a similar fate. Golf,
however, played all the year round by the
small local climbers, has so far escaped un-
touched ; and one daring spirit who sug-
gested that no discrimination be shown is
branded for ever as a Socialist of the deep-
est dye. As a prominent member of one of
the local Women’s Leagues nicely put it,
“No one objects to the golfers ; but we don’t
want everyone allowed to do as he likes on
Sunday.” v , ,

Absurd as it may seem, it is said that vanity bags,
for carrying handkerchief, purse and cigarette-case,

THE IMMORALITY OF ALL THINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Is dancing moral?” —Violent and general,y hos-
tile correspondence in Melbourne Age.
Yes, dancing is an evil thing,
Inspiring horrid thoughts in us!
v Where maids and misters closely cling,
And slip, and slide, and sway, and swing,
While music stirs the pulses thus,
Be sure the steps we take so well,
Are steps that lead straight down to Hell.
How can they fail to make for sin,
The Boston and the Turkey Trot,
The waltz, and two-step ? Devils grin
When, swaying to the fiddles’ din,
Around the room the dancers hot,
Each conscious of the other's charms,
Go giddily with clasping arms.
But, then, alas, we must admit
Most other things are wicked, too.
For talking very few are fit,
And walking leads one to the pit
As readily as dances do;
While, though this waltzing is a curse,
The act of sitting-out is worse.
It is a sin to stand about,
A sin to lounge upon the sand,
A greater sin, I have no doubt,
Is loafing in, or going out
Upon the Block to do the grand;
And picnics oft in quiet tents
Have ruined happy innocents.
A erov’d of people that we meet
Are wicked men because they drink,
And some are worse because they eat,
And some because they “sing a treat.”
So one at length is forced to think
The only moral cert, ahead
Is being absolutely dead,-
VICTORIA.

Melbourne Harbor Trust continues its
crusade against wharf pillagers, and mer-
chants are beginning to feel more secure.
The other day nc> less than three scoundrels
were fined ss. apiece—two of them were old-
age pensioners and the third a feeble, middle-
aged woman, and they got their deserts for,
stealing coal that had fallen on the wharves
in transit from the ships’ holds to railway
trucks. The old men had only a lump or
two apiece, but the woman was a wholesale
villain, having brought a dilapidated pram
in which to wheel away her two-penn’orth
of booty.

By The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant: —
The one-time smellful and now historic Tank
Stream unexpectedly came before the Sydney Land
Board last week on an application to purchase por-
tion of it, adjoining properties in George, Pitt and
Ash streets. The course of the stream is from the
Post Office, in Martin Place, to the back of the
A.M.P. building, in Pitt-street, and thence to Circu-
lar Quay. In its original state it took its rise
about where the Royal Hotel now stands. The
“stream” is, for the most part, owned by no one,
and is vested in the State as waste lands. It is
bricked and covered in, but the surface cannot be
used for building purposes. The only value of the
area, which is only 6ft. in width, is to provide light
and air for the premises abutting it. The owners
of some of the buildings between Martin-place and
Hunter-street recently purchased from the Govern-
ment, for £350, the freehold of that part of the
“Stream” between their properties, the right being
reserved by the Government to enter at any- time
to clean out the aqueduct or repair it. The Land
Board was applied to last week by other owners for
similar rights. Evidence was called as to value.
One firm put £1 per foot upon it, or £250 for the
lot; another valuator said £625, and the Board takes
time to consider which of the two looks most like
the right thing. What is the real value of a hole
and a smell?
AN UNFORTUNATE ALLUSION.
FOREIGN GENT (who has come to rescue pal’s
luggage from unpleasant landlady): "Ogg-
skews me , eef you blease, von momendt.
Mein friendt dells me you have de schmall-
pox—dot 'e 'aff giff it you vile ’e shtopp

Resident Australian artists are putting
up an agitation to secure for .themselves
a fair share of the £20,000 that are to be
lavished on the mural decoration of the new
Commonwealth buildings in London, it is
pointed out with some vehemence that the
Australian artist in Australia is much worse
off than the Australian artist elsewhere, in
fact, it is only the Australian artist who
has been very much elsewhere who can sell
to any extent in Australia; consequently
when an Australian Government has money
to spend on paint, in common fairness the
local brushman should get a show. As it is,
that £20,000, with an additional £lO,OOO for
sculpture, is to be handed over to Australian
artists now in Bullopolis—another instance
of how Australian charity begins at Home.
THE CHEQUE THAT WAS CAST
BEFORE SWINE.
SHE: “And your father gave five hundred
pounds for that picture. Just to show how
much you care for Art, I suppose?”
THE SON AND HEIR : “No. Just to show how
much we don't care for five hundred
pounds .”
“Pollice Verso’s” robust curse: —
The Felton Art Bequest to the Melb. National
Gallery, considered from the viewpoint of Australian
art and artists, is frostier than the cosy corner
where Dr. Mawson is wintering. In the six years
(1905-11) £41,000 has been spent on 120 oil paint-
ings water-color drawings, charcoal drawings, chalk
drawings, lithographs, etchings, bronzes, statues, and
pen and ink sketches. There is even a mahogany
commode costing £382- Of the 120 samples of art-
ware only 14 were cofnmitted by Australian artists,
and for the best of them (Norman Lindsay’s “Pollice
Verso”), the culprit got a mean £157 10s. lo
pursue an inquiry into the financial aspects of this
trust that has failed, the dearest purchase was J. G.
Corot’s “Bent Tree,” costing £5750, and the cheap-
est William Strang’s etching, “Back of Beyond,
dirt-cheap at 945. 6d. Eleven objets dart out of
120 cost over £lOOO apiece, and it is really worth
filing a bill of particulars:- Turners Okehampton
Castle,” £1100; Fremiet’s “Joan of Arc,’ a bronze
equestrian statue, £1800; J. O. Corot’s Bent Tree,
£5750; Burne-Jones’s replica of his Wheel of
Fortune,” £1700; Jules Dupre’s Marine View,
£lBOO ; Watteau’s tiny Les Ja^ ux J., ofw f . ’
Bertram Mackennal’s bronze, Circe, £l2OO, Bas
tien Lepage’s painting, “Annunciation to the Shep-
herds,’’ £ 1365 ; Puvis de Chavanne s Winter,
£2000; Sir Joshua Reynolds’s worn-out portrait of
Miss “Offv” Palmer (very much offy), £5OOO, ana
John Hoppner’s small portrait of “Perdita, £2OOO.
For manv'of the paltry purchases an amateur artist
in London, one Frank Gibson, is responsible to the
trustees, who are a doctor, a chemist, a banker an
ironmonger and an ex-buildmg contractor. Probably
the community is indebted to the building contractor
for the stonemason’s specimens by the great Auguste
Rodin, the lesser-great Bertram Mackennal and the
sfnaller Alfred Gilbert. For his services the public
ought to be grateful. But the two dealers in N pills
are evidently believers in buying small quan-
tities of cheap stuff put up in attractive bqxes, be-
cause most of the purchases are insignificant but
well-framed. There will be no need to extend the
National Gallerv to house the Felton grotesqderie.
Ke“far years’ collection could go inside two immi-
grants’ wooden trunks. Why do the trustees not
live the local artist a chance? Why is there no
Australian section in the collection? Why are there
no examples of the beginning of Australian art.
ADart from that, barring the examples of Rodin,
Mackennal Madox Brown, Streeton and Hans Heysen,
there is not one work representing the best
effort of any of the celebrated moderns. Sargent,
the king of" portrait-painters, is represented by a
landscape study ; Holman Hunt, Leighton Brangwyn,
Ti mn- Tones and George Morland are silently slan-
dered bv the imperfect samples of their genius. The
Felton Bequest, so far, is a trivial, p’tiable failure.
“Tiaki”: I often
used to admire those
philanthropists who
advertise that they
will send post-free the
recipe that had cured
them of the results of
drinky and other “in-
discretions.” I used
to think that, out of
the gladness of their
hearts, these good men
had decided to deal out
joy and health to suf-
fering humanity. So
I wrote to a free-cure
man telling him that
I had spots before my
eyes as big as beer
barrels, had dreadful
visions at might,- and
was so weak that I
could hardly go down
to the bank to draw
my breath. With the
recipe (which con-
sisted of about 14
herbs with horrible
names) I got a
thoughtful message
stating that the odds
against getting any of
the greens was about
09£ to 1; further, that
if I did get any of
them, the odds against
receiving the genuine
article was about 250 f
to 1; and the odds
against getting the
whole —pure or im-
pure-—was like betting
on which horse will
jump first at the re-
surrection. The ad-
vertiser, however, had
bands of workmen in
Persia, Houndsditch and other unexplored
places plucking bales of herbs for him ; and
it the dr inky indescresher liked to send half
wnnia ri i? e of °i le <°L his old indiscretions he
would be cured of his spots, nightmares, etc.
On the whole I thought it was a fairly
reasonable fraud. *
Ihe story of the best-arranged suicide on
lecord should appeal to the hearts of married
women. Ihe tale comes from England \
►Sussex tinker went to the'local cemetery
and spent some time in improving his wife’s
grave. He cut the grass, dug out the weeds
trimmed up the shrubs and strewed some
nice, fresh flowers on the mound. Then he
shortened an old Martini-
Henry rifle, fastened it to a
yew tree and improvised a
head rest for himself near
the mouth of the barrel. In
order to get his head com-
fortably on the rest whilst
he pulled the trigger he had
to suspend himself by a
rope. After which the tinker
blew his brains out and
went away to join the
missus. Why he should have
taken so much trouble about
the grave .'when it was
bound to be opened anew to
admit him -is one of those
mysteries which never come out in the evi-
dence. It suggests that even a tinker is not
strictly reasonable before killing himself.
“Sea-lawyer” : Judge Docker lately gave
an opinion that ought to contain at least a
barrel of Costs. It arose from the case of a
taxi-driver, who had been fined for exceed-
ing the speed limit at the “intersection” of
Oxford and Elizabeth streets, Sydney. He
took the point that as Elizabeth-street didn’t
hit Oxford-street at right angles and continue
through to the other side, there was no
"intersection.” Docker, in the absence of any
legal decision defining “intersection,” quoted
Webster, who reckons the word includes the
term “to cut.” Therefore, said Docker,
Elizabeth-street intersected Oxford-street.
That looks reasonable enough, because the
streets cross each other, though not at right
angles. But Docker continued : “He wished
it to be understood that, in his opinion, where
one street runs into another, and does not
continue on the other side, the two streets
are still intersecting streets, and the point of
intersection is the centre of the two streets.”
But why consider the centre of the two
streets? Why not argue that the street that
meets, but does not cross, the other, stops
dead at the edge of the continuous street?
In that case there would be no “cutting,”
and, consequently, no “intersection.” If a
Court ever acts on Docker’s hint, and Costs
doesn’t get immediately busy, then there is
something amiss with Costs.
The Farmers’ Convention at Bairnsdal ‘
(Vic.) has proposed—to put it in the touch-
ing words of the Argus— “a scheme for the
payment of compensation- by the Govern-
ment for diseased animals that are com-
pulsorily destroyed.” This proposal does not
apparently apply to chickens that get the pip
or other infectious complaint. It is con-
fined to dairy cattle. When an aged cow
acquires tuberculosis or pleuro-pneumonia,
owing to circumstances over which the
farmer has sole control, the Government in-
spector will be invited to order her destruc-
tion, and the farmer will be paid
two-thirds of the value of the animal whose
decease from natural causes was thus anti-
cipated. Said value, of course, to be fixed
by the farmer, who follows the cow to her
grave. That is the proposal of the Conven-
tion. A picture of a dairy-farmer implor-
ing the inspector to order the assassi-
nation of old Spot, lest she may die with-
out State assistance, is painted cn The

seems to ]be saying, “Listen to her con-
tagious korf!”

THE MODERN CHURCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Saturday.
Father Bernard Vaughan, the well-known priest,
has recommenced his diatribes.
Week-end motoring, he went on, ha.d killed Sun-
day observance, and young people believed more in
their motoring than in their church. —Cheering cable.
On petros, a rock, the old Church was said to-be
founded ;
A legend believed in by some, but by others held
droll;
Now a reverend person protests —and his fear is well:
grounded —-
That the Church of our day is, apparently, killed
by petrol ! ■ v

THOSE NATURAL QUALITIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Said Icy Irvine at Warragul the other day: “Aus-
tralia is now divided into two camps; one believes
in the ideal of - individual independence, while the
other aims at a weak T hearted dependence on the
State. The essential element of Liberalism is equal
liberty and equal opportunity. That means liberty
to every man to develop the qualities with which
nature has endowed him. ’
The Portly Person breathes again,
And puts away his recent fears ;
Abolished is the look of pain
That marked the business privateers ;
For now that Cook in office sits;
And Irvine lends his legal lore,
Old Fat may hope to use his wits
To full advantage and to score
By working to its full degree
His curious native qualitee.
’Tis scandalous that through the years
When Fisher ruled in Parliament,
The business man was crushed with cares,
And half his busy day was spent
In brooding o’er intentions dire
To hamper his familiar rules.
Though honesty we all admire,
It is a policy for fools;
The wise from such their substance squeeze,
Employing natural qualities.
Now comes the free and blessed day
For all by nature queerly blest
With tricks of trade by which they may
Delude and circumvent the rest;
With cute monopolies the rips
Will wring the cash from simpletons;
With much cheap labor brought in ships
TheyTl put it over Austral's sons,
When Joey Cook (God bless him!) frees
Old Fat’s peculiar qualities.
VICTORIA.

A THING OF BEAUTY.
MAGISTRATE: “ What is the charge, just plain
drunk?”
CONSTABLE : “ Yes, yer Honor; but don't call
her plain or we'll have to tie her down.”
“W.J.H.” : The Maoriland Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is putting in a
plea for the “boundary dog,” one of the finest
types of sheep dog. In some parts of the Dominion
where great sheep walks converge, and there is a
common highway through the boundary, these un-
fortunate animals are tethered for months at a
stretch. Their only reward is an occasional feed
of stale meat, and a drink of water when the
boundary dog’s owner remembers. Some time ago,
in Otago, a boundary dog was left uncared for, for
three weeks. When the owner turned up he found
a skeleton, and the post to which the ani-
mal was tethered, almost gnawed away. Somebody
with a little humanity in his composition also saw
the ghost of the faithful “boundary,” and as a result
the callous owner was sent to gaol for two months.
(Cheers.) The Society is urging the Government to
make the keeping of “boundary” dogs illegal. How
Premier Massey’s squatter advisers will view the
proposal is a matter for further consideration.

“Pick”: When never a horse is out to
win, the public gets a run for its money. At any
rate, it did in a flutter I saw at Jugiong (N.S.W.).
There were three starters, and each rider had secret
instructions to navigate a bolt from the far end of
the course. When the whole procession suddenly
veered across the plain towards the sunset, half the
crowd smelt something over-dead, and took a hand.
Mounting anything handy, it began a wild pursuit.
The other half went in to refresh. After about an
hour the dogs barked, and we filed out to watch an
exciting finish. The racers appeared, rounded up by
the mob of madly-spurring and whip-wielding shear-
ers and boundary-riders. With much cutting-off and
break-neck wheeling, they ultimately hunted the
field past the winning stump,' with the horse I had
backed for a tin of sardines a nose in the lead.
* * * *
“J.L.Z.”: Re the power to divine the
presence of snakes, mentioned by “F.H.R.” (B.
10/4/’l3). Some years ago I knocked about the
tableland townships with a comrade I have since
learned to love as a brother. Before partaking of
a glass of our favorite stimulant he would critically
examine the proffered liquor. Sometimes he would
cautiously hand it back to the bar lady (or gent.)
and say, in his professional voice—“ Thank you, the
other bottle.’’ Now I know why. He possessed the
snake-divining instinct.
» * * »
“A Perry-Winkel” : Some people are easily
satisfied. Take the case of a Mary vale (Vic.) farmer.
He landed home, unyoked his bullocks and walked
inside. Then he noticed that someone had borrowed
his tucker, so he decided to hunt the stranger up.
As the miscreant wasn’t on the premises, the cocky
set out to look for him, and when he had ridden
close on 40 miles he came across the long-lost vic-
tuals. The man in charge of them was asleep, so
the cocky rode into Sale, found a policeman, hired
a sulky and drove back to the snoring camp. The
P.M. gave the villain three days, and then turned to
the farmer to compliment him on his “pluck and
energy.” But the backbone of the country blushed
beneath his whiskers, and “considered he had
already been sufficiently rewarded for his trouble.”
Most people, besides wanting the offender’s scalp,
would have demanded their meal back. Not so this
one. He had ridden 40-odd miles, stayed out all
night doing it, had hired a sulky and wasted much
time at court, but he was perfectly satisfied when
the other chap got three days’ jug. In a burst of
munificence, he said his enemy could keep the
tucker.
* * * *
“N. or M.”: Perth, in the north of the
Apple Island, one of the little towns that flourished m
the coaching days and went under with the coming
of the railway, has been looking up a bit lately.
Population 614 last census, as against
400 or thereabouts the time before.
One hotel remains of six that Perth
supported in the days of its vanity,
when building and fencing and mill-
ing were in full swing, and big
cheques were being knocked down.
It is a matter of envious, memory that
on busy days there was no use for a
till—Mr. Public House just chucked
his takings into a couple of milk-
bowls. In those days two flourmills
served the surrounding districts, and
one of them was responsible for the
first oatmeal made in Tasmania.
There was also a penal settlement of
considerable size, with a detachment
of troops attached. Some of the old
buildings still remain, quaint and
crumbling. Of course, there is a
Gallows Hill, where the body of a
murderer was once gibbeted in a sort
of cage with chains, as ocular demon-
stration that murdering was held in
disrepute by the authorities. The
most permanent and satisfactory re-
sults of the settlement were the mak-
ing of a very fine stone bridge over
the S. Esk. It took about seven
years to build that bridge, and it was
finished in ’4l. To all appearances,
nothing less than 10 earthquakes
could shift it, but the big flood of ’5l
succeeded in pounding out two arches.
Other local assets are fine scenery, a fine
esplanade (saved for the public by the
efforts of Parson Stackhouse), a Baptist
chapel beyond the ordinary, the gift of one
of the sheep-Gibsons, who have been residents of
Perth from goodness-knows-when —at any rate, the
shallow now crossed by the bridge was “Gibson’s
Ford” in ’29.
* * * *
“No Importa”: Perhaps the easiest way
to put “Torres” (B. 19/6/’l3) right is to tell the
truth about Melville Island and its lessee, E. O.
Robinson, whose alias at the Yorick Club (Mel-
bourne) is “Buffalo Bill.” In 1825 the British
Government sent a company of soldiers to Mel-
ville Island to establish a military outpost on the
road to India. Fort Dundas was erected on Apsley
Strait, between Melville and Bathurst Islands, and
relics of the old settlement still exist. After three
years’ exile, the soldiers were withdrawn to Escape
Cliff, near Port Daly, about 30 miles from Darwin,
and subsequently to Victoria, at Port Essington.
A QUESTION OF DEGREE.
HOGAS (who owns the steed):
Its a grand korrse he is, so he
is, art a fine pace we do be makin'."
RYAN (who doesn't own the steed): “ Oh, yes,
'It's a fine pace, no doubt—what there is of it."
While the camp was at Fort Diinlas about
a dozen buffalo were imported from Java, and their
descendants to-day number about 30,000. E. O.
Robinson wag the first man to shoot the beasts for
their hides and horns on the mainland opposite
Melville Island. When he decided that the mainland
was “shot out,” he went over to Melville Island to
spy out the land, and returned with the knowledge,
carefully kept for his personal consumption, that it
was a land flowing with buffalo milk and money.
So he took up the whole of Melville Island (2400
square miles), with the right to buy 5000 acres at
2s. 6d., which right still exists. Next Buffalo Bill
bought all the buffalo on Melville Island from the
S.A. Government at auction for £5O. Then Bill
and two six-feet Irishmen and two partially but not
excessively civilised Darwin niggers started shooting
and skinning. To date they have killed 15,000
buffalo, and as the increase is 3000 calves yearly
there may be 50,000 still roaming the island. The
grass has been eaten into the condition of a well-
kept croquet lawn, manured with the bones and
bodies of buffalo ancestors and near relatives. The
island has been well-watered by Providence, which
also fenced it round with the sea. The climate is
equable, the soil is chocolate, the water is plentiful,
the 500 blackfellows are tame, healthy and teetotal,
and the mosquitoes are not larger than vultures or
more numerous than the sands by the sea-shore.
Your correspondent “Torres” adjured cosmos to
“Give us men who can work ; no others will do for
the North,” implying that ex-soldiers would not
make suitable settlers for Melville Island. Well,
I’ve seen them in India, S. Africa and Egypt, and
they are all right. Lord Roberts’s scheme of
colonising Melville Island with “ex-” (not “old”)
soldiers is, in fact, particularly admirable, because
North Australia will want plenty of drill sergeants
some day soon. After what has been done at
Panama in killing the flies and mosquitoes and
reducing the death-rate from 60 to 10 per 1000,
Melville Island looks like an unoccupied Paradise.
All this yap about the white man being unable to
live and work in North Australia maddens me.
Hasn’t he lived and worked and fought in the
jungle in Mexico, the West Indies, India and the
East Indies for four hundred years, despite mos-
quitoes, whisky, flies, snakes, tigers and niggers?
And once the mosquito is suppressed by the use of
kerosene and wire blinds, North Australia will be
just as good a place to live in as Cottesloe (W.A.),
where the sandflies bite, or Kangaroo Flat (Vic.),
where the blowflies blow, or Port Pirie (S.A.),
whence the fleas have not fled. Melville Island will
produce copra, rubber, cotton, sisal hemp, flax, sago,
rice, coffee, indigo, maize, sugar, timber and oil,
especially oil, because the geological formation is
identical with that of Timor, Java and Sumatra,
only a few miles off. At present the buffalo is
only worth 30s. for his hide and horns; as meat
extract, tallow and frozen meat he would be worth

We have just found out something. I’ll tell you
what it is. But don’t tell Mrs. Spankhurst. About
14 miles from here is a big, wild, scrub-clad moun-
tain, the home of a tribe of suffragette gins. There
is but one man among them. Anyway, our blackboys
swear to this, and it is a fact that uone of the tribes
around here will venture further than the base of
the mountain. One in 20 of the male children are
kept, providing he happens to be an extra-special
sturdy specimen: the rest are either strangled or
otherwise rendered incapable of making themselves
a nuisance later on. If our suffragettes intend to
rule the wor’b on similar lines, what a time ‘s in
store for the noble-browed, curly-haired, dark-eyed,
black-moustached hero of the novelette type! So
far, we’ve only had our blackboys’ word for all this,
but we’re going up that mountain prospecting shortly,
and I’ll tell you about it later on.

for a trip to the other side of the Papuan peninsula
it may be him I met off Taupota—which is a few
miles up the coast from Chads Bay, where the Star
of Peace massacre was the big item, many years
ago. He was then a basking shark, about the color
of a cattle-dog, sprinkled with brownish freckles as
large as the palm of a man’s hand. Comparing his
length with that of the little schooner I was aboard,
I reckoned him to be from 30ft. to 35ft. from nose
to tail, which is not an extraordinary length for a

dining-table. I reckoned the hole in it could have
accommodated a bullock. The huge dorsal fin
“Keto” took notice of was a marked feature of my
fish, and so were the leisurely habits and the appar-
ent desire for company. My marine solicitor arose
from the depths on a still, hot day, flashed his big
fin above the surface a few times, surged about
alongside for two or three minutes, displaying great
lumps of sea-growths on his belly, and then headed
for the Supreme Court. At least, I reckoned that
was his destination.
IN BROWN AND BLUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With rustle silver silken morn
Had drawn her skirts along the hill.
The gladness of the new day born
Fired qll the pulses of my will,
As through the world there seemed to float
The laughter of the brown girl’s throat.
The climbing roses nodding red
Were blown against the window-pane.
I thought of one smoke-dusky head,
And little kisses, like hot rain,
From scarlet lips all moist and warm,
And two dark eyes, and one soft arm.
The happy day was wild and blue,
To-morrow seemed so far away.
A thousand tasks were mine to do
E’er eve put on her sandals grey,
And every hour I knew would fleet
Down the swift day on twinkling feet.
A rose to pluck, a kiss to steal,
A light and laughing word to speak,
Again the warm delight to feel
Of loose hair blown against my cheek,
A ramble where the crisp grass sold
Its morning green for noonday gold.
A cup to drink of that old joy
That danced with light in elder years,
When Time himself was but a boy
With cradle music in his ears,
And love by shining land and sea
Held daintier love upon his knee.
The brown girl called, I must away ;
The world with all its boughs and bloom
And sun and bird and waters gay
Seemed but the path to one small room,
One little room that gladness drest
In white to make a brown girl’s nest.
And from that nest the whole world seemed
A window picture set in gold,
Where roses and red poppies dreamed,
In fire to shield us from the cold,
Lest envy blowing down the day
Should chill one hot, sweet thought away.
Oh, silver morn and sunny noon,
And flying moments freighted sweet,
Grey sandaled eve and night’s white moon,
And winds that sing and seas that beat!
Through life and death there seems to float
The laughter of the brown girl’s throat.

“Eddyson” : Ned Warbois was tired of life.
He had been living at Tinlid for 32 years before he
made his surprising discovery. No doubt Tinlid
was dull, being fat removed from the picture shows
and the other refinements; of life. Kirkpatrick’s pub,
the nearest outpost of civilisation, was seven miles
away. Ned Warbois had not seen a comic opera in
38 years. He knew nothing of roller-skating and
lour o’clock teak, the two-step, motor-cycling, Gaby
glides; and similar delights of the age. His hut
was desolate. He hadn’t even a dog. The jew-
lizard with which he had struck up a sort of acquaint-
anceship when Nivisons left the Bend had died of
old age two years ago. Warbois was full up of it
all. He took a pick and shovel, and began to dig
his own grave. He selected a spot under the big
wattle at the turn of the hill, and after making a
very neat, coffin-shaped excavation 3ft. deep struck
solid Milestone. Very angry, Warbois shifted his
site down to the level nearer the creek. He cut out
another smart grave, and got down about 4ft. before
sunset. When he went to resume work next morn-
ing his grave was full of water. He shifted again -to
a spot near his own hut, and dug a model grave in
seven hours. His intention was to take possession
on the following day. On the following day the
grave had caved in. Warbois went back to the turn
of the hill again, spent three days putting down
bores, and eventually made a grave for himself with
the assistance of hammer and gad. It took him a
week to bottom. Then he made all necessary arrange-
ments, left a docket for the coroner, and went and
laid himself to rest in his sepulchre. He put a
folded blanket and a pillow in for comfort and con-
venience, and disposed himself to die, after read-
ing the burial service over himself. It was his in-
tention to remain there till the end came. He had
no poison, and he couldn’t shoot himself because he
was such a shocking bad shot, and if he drowned
or hanged himself he couldn’t see how he was to
arrive in his grave after the event. Warbois had
been lying so about three hours when he was awak-
ened from a refreshing slumber by human noises.
A large, unseemly head, with an excess of whiskers,
was suspended above him. “Hello, below!” said the
head. “Whatcher want?” snorted Warbois. “Can’t
yer letter man die?” “Beg your parding,” said the
head, “but can yeh tell a bloke the way t’ Shingle
Hill?” “Over the rise, bear t’ the left, keep Goose
Wing on yer right elber—straight on.” The head
lingered. “’Ow's a bloke t’ remember all that?”
it said. “Would yeh get up ’n’ show a bloke?”
“No, I wouldn’t. Lemme die! It’s somethin’ if a
man’s dyin’ is t’ be interrupted this way.” “Would
yeh kindly mind putt n’ off dyin’ fer 10 minutes
t’ show a feller his way?” Warbois growled an oath
or two as he swarmed out of his grave. He showed
the head the land marks to Shingle Hill, then re-
turned to his hole in the ground, and resumed his
dying. lie was getting on splendidly, when at mid-
night a stray bullock of Lloyd’s fell in on him.
Warbois was furious. The damthing might have
killed a man. Warbois dislodged the cow’s cousin,
and lay down again. At seven in the morning it
began to rain. It rained heavily. The grave leaked;
moreover, the surface water was coming in. By
10 o'clock the water was about Ned’s neck as he sat
up. Later, he had to kneel or drown. Eventually
he was compelled to stand. Then he was forced to
climb out to save his life. Warbois was ropable.
You never saw a man more indignant than War-
bois was. Wet through, he set furiously to work,
and filled in his grave. Madly he stamped the earth
down. Then he rolled up a sudden sort of swag,
and started off. Half a mile away he shook his
fist back at the old hut. “Curse yeh!” he said.
“I’ll go where a man can die in peace.” AVarbois is
now boots and generally useful in a pub in a River -
ina town.

“W.S.”: Our Sawbones was grumbling
about people dragging him out of bed at all hours ;
but the case that stuck the worst was put up on him
by a devotee of Cow, who hauled him out one morning
at 3.30, and rowed him across the dark, foggy river
to diagnose a case that needed no hurry at all. Saw-
bones could not understand why he had been dis-
turbed like that, until the cowman, having put him
back over the river, looked at his watch and said:
“I reckon I’ve managed that pretty well. I’ll be
back in time for milking.”
PAY DAY.
THE BOSS: “ Well, Jacky, how many days you put in this week?"

“S. S. Severn” (concerning some local
talent) : Talking of Genee and a few others, I saw, at
Daru, west end of Papua, a wizened-up little native
boy do some amazing steps that blended and formed
a perfectly beautiful symmetry of motion, while he
piped the while through his little bamboo reeds.
And away up on the Mitchell River, in the Gulf
Country, there was given me a revelation in the art
of dancing. It was night, windy and black dark.
The women of the tribe (the Koko-mundi) sat to-
gether on one side striking the palms of their hands
together and chaunting in dull monotone. The
hunters and elders squatted around, in three-parts of
a circle, each man with his red-coned firestick erect
in the sand beside him, and puffing at his bamboo
pipe. Suddenly, out of the surrounding darkness, a
whirling something shot into the circle and skimmed
and swooped like a seabird. It resolved into a
youth with feathers flung from his head and flutter-
ing at his thioat. For 20 minutes his feet never
seemed to touch the earth. Suddenly, and unex-
pected as he came, he vanished. Seen many times,
by daylight and moonlight, his dancing never lost
its strange, exotic charm. Satin-skinned Negele, of
the Torres Strait Isles (daughter of Ambon Mam-
oose, of Moubiang), is not only a dancer of repute,
but composes dances. One dance and song, by
girls, describes a party of Papuan head-hunters
stealing upon Douan (a small island), at
nig'it, whilst the men are out dugong spear-
ing. The story tells how the men of Saibai
(the next isle), seeing the raiding war canoes, make
the blue-flare fire and set off to the rescue. The
women of Douan run away and hide in caves. Negele
herself dramatically interpreting a distressed damsel
flying from the cannibals. Then there was a fish-
ing dance, and a song about a seagull that was
really a chief’s son under the pourri-pourri of a
wizard. As the dance-story progressed the wizard,
in the form of a great fish, caught the gull at sea
and dragged it to the bottom, where it was impris-
oned for many moons. Subsequently, the fish was
caught by the village belle and forced to break the
pourri-pourri that bound her lover. When the gull
became a man once more, he and the girl married
and lived happily in the crown of a cocoanut palm,
where they fed all the gulls that cared to look in.

“J.G.”: ‘‘Leo Lear’s” par re fresh-water
yabbies and their summer water supply (B.
22/5/’l3) reminds me that over a decade ago I,
along with another bloke, took a job to erect a mile
or two of post and wire fence in a hope-forsaken,
scrubby, yabbie-infested part of the Dandenong
“T. Hirst”: My cobber, Bill the Pom-
mey, reckons this country’s a delusion. Bill, owing
to the recent deluge, had to take a few days’ rest
from toil. Thereupon he got angry. “This coun-
try’s no good to me,” he decided. “Why, at ’Ome
on a wet day I only lose three bob. Here I lose
eight flamin’ bob! That’s no good to me!”
Ranges (Vic.). The line we had to fence was on a
steep hillside, and we had to fight our way through
the scrub with every post we split. The first two
or three holes were sunk in the usual way with
shovel and crowbar. Then we discovered that, after
taking a spit out of the holes with a shovel, the
underneath soil could be shoved down with a splash
into about a couple of feet of water. And when this
was done we always saw a few yabbies poke their
noses up through the apertures. They seemed to
inhabit some sort of an underground running stream,
for the water was certainly not stationary, as it
would be if the chain of holes had been constructed
in the manner “Leo Lear” mentions. No rain had
fallen for weeks, and the only sign of water was
where the yabbies were found; and there was not the
slightest indication that running water was so close
to the surface. But there it was all along that
hillside. We put up hundreds of posts that had
nothing to hold them but water and a few inches of
surface soil packed loosely round the posts, and a
yabbie to act as sentinel and see that nobody em-
bezzled the post-hole or drank the slush.

“Tarto” : “Mallarapoonie” (B. 8/5/’l3)
spoke of some blacks being able to talk on the
intake of their breath, and says this is a practice
unknown among whites. AVrong ! Allow me to cite
the case of Quilty. Quilty was a bullock navigator,
and cursed and howled and bellowed his team between
Urana and Albury (N.S.W.) before the intermediate
railway stations sprang up. Many a time, as young-
sters, we sat on an adjacent fence to watch “the man
who could talk backwards” yoke a- . wild ’un.
Quilty could keep up a continuous flow of words,
and he claimed that hereby he could get 2 iewt.'
more out of a “bullick” than any other driver on
the road.
“Souter Johnnie”: “Marloo” asks (B.
6/2/’ 13) why Boards of Health, etc., do not adopt
Morrissey’s alleged cure for snakebite. Perhaps
Morrissey has never submitted it to any of them ;
or, if he has, they have perhaps turned it down as
worthless; which it probably is. This thing has
been long enough on deck to have made some head-
way if it were a genuine antidote; but one hears
less of it now than formerly. It is hardly conceiv-
able that no medical man can be found to so far
overcome professional prejudice as to give it a show.
Anyway, “Marloo’s” evidence doesn't help much.
Said evidence is: (1) Four people bitten by un-
specified snakes applied Morrissey’s remedy ; didn't
die. (2) One eight-year-old child bitten by tiger
snake; died. No information forthcoming as to
whether permanganate or a ligature or anything
was applied to the child. In giving evidence before
a Bulletin commission, witnesses should state the
size and names of all snakes, centifeet, rumors,
myths, etc. There are over 60 varieties of venom-
ous snakes in Australia (excluding jim-jams, which
have never been properly classified), but only five of
them are fatal to healthy adults. The five are:
Tiger snake ( Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acan-
thophis Antarctica), brown snake ( Diemenia tex-
tilis), red-bellied black snake ( Pseudechis porpliy-
riacus), copperhead ( Denisonia superba), in that
order of venomosity. The Australian Institute of
Tropical Medicines, Townsville, could swiftly and
finally settle the fate of Morrissey’s, or any other,
snakebite “cure.” It should get a trial, certainly,
along with the countless cancer, consumption and
other “cures” ; and if found to be a deliberate fraud
those perpetrating the fraud should also get a trial
—and a sentence. While on the subject of snakes,
I nominate the Northern Territory as the least
snaky section of the continent, and I put it down to
the great bush fires and the Great Black Brudder,
who is an ophiologist when he isn’t a darned
nuisance. I estimate, from G.8.8.’s own accounts,
that he is responsible in the Territory for a shortage
of about 43i miles of snake per annum. The re-
turns for bandicoots, Chinamen’s watermelons, etc.,
are not yet to hand.

“Gouger”: “Platman” is wrong when he
states that Cooktown and district natives do not use
the boomerang. They do, but only occasionally.
The reason, I presume, is because there is so much
scrub country in the district that there is no room
to swing a mosquito, let alone a boomerang. But
away behind Cooktown I have seen some big argu-
ments in which the boomerang was the principal
means of debate. Another nasty weapon in the
hands of these natives, as also with the Herberton
tribes, is the big wooden sword, from 4ft. to sft.
long, 6in. broad, with a very short handle. A
white man can barely wield some of these swords,
but a black, with a huge shield in his left hand,
carved and painted yellow (red in war time), can
use the implement with marvellous dexterity. The
knee joint is a favorite spot aimed for. A successful
blow brings an opponent down crippled, and then
the things the vanquished gets done to his head are
plain awful.

“Te Babarantiko”: On both sides of the
Equator, from 3deg. N. to 3deg. S. lat. (the belt
where it always rains), right through Malaysia and
Oceania, millipeds are plentiful. In sizes they range
from a body of leadpencil thickness and Bin long
to the thickness and length of a darning-needle*
Some are phosphorescent. Also, they are all abso-
lutely harmless, but it is positively uncanny to see
one of the beasts working so many legs set so close
together. Prompted by scientific enthusiasm, I one
time cut a large specimen in three sections. The
section with the head on it promptly sought and
found sanctuary in a crack, and the headless sectio ,j
also began hunting for a hiding-place. I headed
them off by holding the blade of a knife a half-inch
from the raw end (not touching), and each time
the end shrank away from it as if it could see or
smell the steel; in fact, exactly as the head would
lave done. The experiments were interrupted by
6 arrival of “ nigger who had owed
me $55.50 for two years, and, meanwhile, sold all
his copra to the opposition trader. He came to
cadge tobacco, and in the unpleasantness that fol-
lowed the cutlets disappeared.

Design for stamp to replace the old kangaroo.
From the Speck State:—
J wo i unassuming but widely-known Tasmanians
took their last journey on the same day recently.
One was J. J. Gaffney, a pioneer in many a West
Coast store, pub and prospecting venture; the other
was Robert Mather, the draper member of the big
Quaker family of old Hobart Town. Possibly neither
regarded the other as a really good citizen, yet both
had their stock of good points. Neither ever refused
the helping hand to a needy fellow-mortal. James
Jim, and once put in an unostentatious
shift in the local Assembly as member for Lyell;
Robert, never by any chance Bob, was a persistent
worker in Sunday-school and Benevolent Society in-
terests. One was planted in the little graveyard of
the Society of Friends, the other was tucked in by
Father Hennebr.v at Cornelian Bay. If thev happen
to alight on Heaven’s doorstep together, Robert will
probably look at James in astonishment, and re-
mark : ‘ Friend, art thou here ?” and Jim will prob-
ably appear equally - surprised, but is pretty sure to
say to the Gatekeeper: “Lave him come in, Peter:
he s not too good, but nayther am I.”
Vic. Premier Watt’s family has increased
during his absence from Melbourne. He is
now the father of four. Take them all
round, the leading politicians of this country
have set a good example in peopling the
empty spaces, in which respect poor old Joke
Hook can claim to be one of the best.
Dean Webster, of the Chapel Royal, Dub-
lin, provided a shocking example for elderly
go-slow gentlemen by dying on the golf link's
after reaching the eighth hole. But whilst
the apostles of regular meals and mild exer-
cise were deploring the fate of the golfer a
rector in Cornwall dropped dead at his Sun-
day tea table, probably as the result of
under-exertion. Then muscular Christianity
lamented that the late rector had not gone
in for skittles and weight-lifting. He was
only 81 when he fell on the floor —a victim
to the sedentary life.
At a meeting of Prahran (Melb.) Town,
Council the other night, it was mentioned
that George Fairbairn, who got put out by
the Labor man at last Federal election for
the district, had been in the habit of dis-
tributing £lOOO annually among the poor
of Prahran. It was done anonymously “and
through a councillor.” Well, The Bulle-
tin supposes that even anonymous contribu-
tions must go through somebody, though,
to be sure, there’s nothing secretive
about a town councillor. Anyhow, it is
clear that Fairbairn can still afford to be
generous, in spite of the land taxes and
other democratic forces which cause capital
to bound out of the country.
veteran ex-Judge Boucaut has had

much more of the alphabet in his time. The
old Judge is in very poor health, but man-
aged to attend at the unveiling, and even to
say a few sentences in reply to the panegyric
bv his old colleague, Chief Justice
Hay, who is only a little younger than
Boucaut, but still almost as active as ever.
Acting-Premier Butler (S.A.) told the
people at Franklin Harbor that if his new
knighthood was good for nothing else it
would at least give people something to eall
him besides “Dismal Dick,” a name that had
stuck to him ever since he was Treasurer
under Jenkins in the droughty times. In
those days Butler went about with a face as
long as a coffin, or a boarconstrictor, where-
fore the well-worn tag. It was a source of
great annoyance—not to say grief—to
Richard that he was turned out of office just
as the seasons changed. Being quite aware
ot ins own virtues, he genuinely believes
even now that when he is not in office the
country is in danger of going to the dogs.
Ihat makes him sorry for the country ; be-
sides he hates to annoy, or embitter the dogs.
He is bd years old, has married twice and
owns about 15 children.
“Vic.,” in a discursive vein:—
Mrs. Malleson, leader of Victorian Society in the
last generation, has died. The cause of her decease
was ill-health, combined with a lack of recovery and
a failure to recuperate. Her husband, long since
deceased, was the most eminent banking lawyer of
his day. His brother, Colonel Malleson, wrote

THE OLD WEATHER PROPHECY
MACHINE.
AUSTRALIA: “ Whichever way the rotten
machine works I can't see that this is
going to get any benefit.”
In the letters to Chief Commissioner
Sainsbury, advising a raid on a few fast
cafes in Melbourne, there were statements
about a drunken aide-de-camp having danced
deliriously on tables in the early hours of a
certain Sunday morning. These letters, hav-
ing been handed over to the papers, The
Age printed, the allusion to the “drunken
aide-de-camp”; but the Argus, true to its
natural and acquired instincts, gracefully
eliminated reference to the Government
House gentleman. To be sure, no right-
thinking paper, whatever its motto, can be
expected to tell the whole truth about aides-
de-camp.
“0.K.” has a reminiscence:—
a < - >n ® , c^ n eas dy believe the cable statement that
of” 1 Gll , lott ’ 0f Melbourne, died at Sheffield, from
the eltects of somnambulism. I never, saw him walk-
mg in his sleep, but I’ve heard him talking to
phantoms of his brain in Collins-street, Melbourne
One evening, when the pavement at the west end of
the street was almost deserted, I heard what sounded
like an altercation coming towards me. I looked
up, and there was Sam Gillott bustling along, punch-
blmahlf left pa . lm . 'M th his ri g ht fist, and informing
s™““’ ° r 111 visible crowd, that he wouldn’t stand
/T G ~T d ! * wo >? t st and it—d’ye think ?” was all
that X heard, as the furious old solicitor hurried by
“ ' vas a t the time when the question of Gillott suc-
ihadTg McEacharn as Gaud Mayor was agitating
the Town Council, and I think Samuel’s agitation
proceeded from that cause. Be was one of those
bioodless-faced men who assume a calmness when
£ have J t not - Behind his mask he must have
been a most nervously excitable person. His imag-
ination got no repose. Heaven knows where he
thought he was walking when he fell down a stair-
case in his dreams, and fractured his spine.
I he late Sam Gillott., solicitoi' and ex-Gaud
Mayor of Melbourne, who died the other
day ot injudicious sleep-walking, was un-
derstood to be the wealthiest member of the
prosperous firm of Gillott, Croker and Snow-
the old i a y s : It defended the disastrous
libel case of Speight (ex-Commissioner of
Vic. Railways) v. the Age, the plaintiff’s

municipal life and politics. In the latter
field of publicity he proved a striking failure
nr erm f; J ‘ ent 7, the Bent .'-took him
for Attorney-General, and some of his
chickens came home to roost. Wren’s
infamous Tote was then in full
blast, whilst Judkins, the fighting Wowser
was steadily forcing the Government to take
serious action against it. Sam Gillott re-
presented the main force for ’Tote suppres-
sion, and, with a view to intimidating the
Government, some facts regarding Gillott’s
ownership of gay” houses were duly pre-
paied. These were supplied to Judkins, and
a weekly paper, and were published simul-
taneously by both parties. The revelation
was too much for Gillott. His nerve fS
and he slunk out of the Ministry, whereas
the scandalous Tom Bent, although in fear
of exposure, kept a bold face on him and
went for a trip to England. A lot of Gil
hHn S . PaSt was t - hen to ° old to be worth
bringing up against him. In his vouneer
days he had been the colleague of Joe
Thompson, the bookmaker (who shared manv
propputy investments with him) in S
queer transactions. Thev were br^fi? 16

“Chasuble” : Pastor Marshall, of
Scots Church, Melbourne, has
just received one of those little
douceurs which sweeten the hard
lot of the sky-pilot now and again.
His congregation gives him 300
guineas. Seriously, it has been well
earned. He came about 1887, when
a shower of ecclesiastic genius de-
scended on Melbourne. Archbishop
Carr, Marshall, Bevan and Sug-
den were a quartette of drops.
Scots Church had been in a bad
way. While Strong was pastor,
Higinbotham gave a heterodox lec-
ture. The Presbyters demanded a
disavowal from Strong, who refused
to give it. It is strange, but not un-
precedented, that Rentoul, Strong’s
most violent antagonist, after-
wards became one of his chums.
Boer sympathy drew them to-
gether. Meanwhile, however,
Strong cut the painter, and nearly
took the Scots Church with him;
and Scots Church was the best
property of the Kurruk in Vic-
toria. After a desperate fivht,
Cameron Lees was imnorted from
Edinburgh as pastor pro tern. He
w r as succeeded pro tem. by an
equally powerful man, Marshall
Lang, of Glasgow, father of the
present Archbishop of York and
the Bishop of Leicester, and Uncle
of Matheson Lang, the actor.
Strong then founded the Austra-
lian Church, in Flinders-street,
while Pastor Marshall carried for-
ward the work of Lang and
Cameron Lees.
After lasting 125 years, the Royal
Marines’ connection with Australia has been
ended. Before they were dubbed “Royal,”
they came out with Governor Phillip—that
was in 1788 —and did duty in Sydney until
relieved by the New South Wales Corps, or
Rum-Selling Corps, or 102nd Regiment. Their
subsequent service was on board war vessels
in the Southern Seas. In the early days
they supplied the little colony with many
officials. Thus the first Judge-Advocate,
Colonel Collins, afterwards first Governor of
Van Diemen’s Land, was a marine ; and so
was Colonel Johnston, who deposed Governor
Bligh, though he afterwards joined the
N.S.W. (Rum) Corps.
DISMAL DICK BUTLER , of S.A., whom
the King recently nick-named Sir Richard.
V hat a country Australia is for records !
Last week it was established in a court of
law that i)r. Thring, of Sydney, had put up
with a marriage that was one “in name

years. When the Last Trump sounds and

long-distance patience, Peter or some such
authority will be heard to say, firmly, “Out

IN. S. Wales, who has you licked to a frazzle”
that is, if there is any equity and fair
dealing m the Hereafter.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
All the States balance now on June 30,
so this week we can get some idea of the sort of year
most of them have had. So far as income is con-
cerned it has been another gorgeous time, and every
State shows bigger figures than in the previous year.
Expenditure has, however, romped ahead in most
cases far faster than revenue.
N. S. Wales is the horrible example:—
1911-12. 1912-13. Increase.
Revenue .. £15,776,816 £16,053,806 £276,990
Expenditure .. 15,411,857 17,002,292 1,590,435
Surplus .. £364,959
Deficit .. £948,486
This expenditure is exclusive of the contributions to
tile Public Works Fund. Counting in the statutory
contributions to that fund, there was a surplus of
£16,295 in 1911-12, and a deficit of £1,308,184 in
1912-3. If the voluntary contributions to the same
fund were added, the deficit for the past year would
be swollen by another £200,000. Whether the
total amount should be added depends mainly upon
the use to which the fund has been put. If the
money went in repairs and upkeep, and in paying
for non-productive things that ought to be charged
against revenue, then the whole lot ought to be
added on to the disgraceful deficit. But those
figures give only a small view of the disgrace. Here
is the larger view:—
Total Revenue (including sales of public
lands) £16,053,806
Outgoings:—
Revenue account ..£17,002,292
Works Fund .. . . 816,184
Closer Settlement .. 55,607
Loan account '. . .. 9,094,808
26,968,891
Amount by which N.S.W. has lived be-
yond its income for one year .. £10,915,085
Taking the average population at 1,690,000, this
means that for every household of five persons the
Government has gone into debt to the extent of
£32 ss. 10d. during the year—money that has been
splashed up in all directions. No wonder there has
been a boom. Unluckily, there is also going to be
a bill, and there will have to be a reckoning after
the bill comes in.
Treasurer Cann, who is by no means the man
most to blame, owns up to a deficit (on Revenue
account) of £1,228,380. His figures are apparently
made up this way:—
Deficit as shown above .. .. .. £948,486
Surplus of “other receipts” over “other
expenditure” (apart from ordinary
Revenue and Expenditure headings).. 279,804
Net Deficit £668,682
Add transfers to Public Works Fund .. 559,698
Total Deficit (on the Treasurer’s
reckoning) .. .. ..£1,228,380
But, after all, it doesn’t matter much what head you
stuff the deficit under. The shocking fact is the one
mentioned before —that the State partly pushed itself
and partly drifted £10,915,085 further into pawn
last year, notwithstanding that it sold (say) a
million pounds’ worth of public land during the
period. Cann piles up excuses, of course. They boil
down to this, that the revenue didn’t come in as
was expected. To that the answer is, if money wasn’t
coming in as expected, then money shouldn’t have
been allowed to go out according to the original
estimates. But even now no curtailment of expendi-
ture is proposed. For a start railway fares and
freights have been put up again, following the bad old
railway practice of making the public pay most when
it can afford to pay least; and there will be increases
in the income and stamp taxes. These are the first
payments on account of the boom and the waste that
accompanies every boom and is perhaps its worst
feature.
Victoria has so far prepared no expenditure figures,
but the Treasury expects to come out about level on
the year. The revenue was £10,075,555, and odds
and ends are being scraped up diligently in order
to bring the total to somewhere near the Treasurer’s
estimate of £10,120,000. His estimate of expendi-
ture was £10,097,000, and apparently it depends
on the success in scraping up the odds and ends
whether there will be a deficit or not. Loan figures
are not available. They don’t matter: the old man
passes his debts on to the baby, and goes on serenely.
S. Aus. had a revenue of £4,504,719, as against the
estimate of £4,381,812, and the actual of
£4,450,739 for the previous vear. The seventh
good harvest in succession on top of the high price
of metals and the great activity of Broken Hill (for
which S. Aus. acts as providore and carrier) is re-
sponsible for the good showing. Neither expendi-
ture nor loan figures are available; but it is under-
stood there will be a so-called surplus. The Trea-
surer is proud of the fact that in seven years some-
thing like 2 \ millions of public debt has been wiped
off out of surpluses. The Bulletin doesn’t
want to rob S. Aus. of any of its smug self-satisfac-
tion; it merely noints out that for every £1 which
the State has paid off since 1903, it has put £2
on, and that it has only 46 p.c. of its debt repre-
sented by railways and tramways, as against the
Australian average of 61 p.c., a great amount of the
other 54 p.c. being represented by non-productive
roads and culverts and* jetties and buildings and
long-obsolete Defence works, which should never
have been charged to loans at all.
Queensland, the State which more or less habitu-
ally fakes its accounts, in order to dodge the pro-
vision that surpluses shall go to reduce loan debts,
claims as follows :
1911-12. 1912-13. Increase.
Revenue .. £5,989,347 £6,378,213 £388,866
Expenditure .. 5,965,692 6,372,097 406,405
Surplus .. £23,655 £6,116
The Treasurer frankly admits that he could have
made the surplus greater; but, instead of paying
off old debts with the money, he used £20,000 to
pay for wooden buildings which it had at first been
intended to pay for with loan money, and £19,000
spent on immigration was treated the same way. It
is quite right to pay for these things out of revenue;
it was quite wrong to have ever thought of paying
for them in any other way. But though this little
thimbleful of loan expenditure was saved, things are
bad enough and too bad. No less than £2,448,066
has been chalked up during the year for the same
old infant to pay presently. Approximately the
population of Queensland is 665,000, so this State
has added £lB 14s. to the troubles of every house-
hold of five persons. It isn’t quite such a ghastly
record as the Ma State’s; but it probably would have
been worse if the Government had been able to
overdraw its accounts as freely. Fortunately in this
case, Queensland is tied to one bank, and that bank
has learned its lesson.

Considering the size of the boom in railway and
house and bridge and other building, £1234 isn’t
much to have over after paying the dividend. But
you never can tell. “Stocks are in good condition
and valued under cost.” Stocks stand at £40,731
in the accounts, and they may be valued at £5O or
A 5000 under cost. Whatever the amount by which
they have been valued under cost, it has come out of
profits. Also, a “generous appropriation” has been
made for depreciation, and that, of course, has come
out of profits, too. It may be more than enough to
cover fair depreciation, in which case the true pro-
fits have been understated; on the other hand, no
doubt, it may be less than enough. This much is
certain: if the co. isn’t making profits and stuffing
them away somewhere (and two places have been
mentioned where they could be stuffed away), it
isn’t doing as well as it should be doing under the
present exceptional circumstances of the timber
trade; and if it can make only enough profit to pay
a 10 p.c. div. and put by £2727 in 12 months now,
it will have a mighty hard struggle to pay 10 or
even 8 p.c. under normal conditions in the timber
trade. Judging by the few straws that float on the
surface, the chances are that the co. is strengthening
its position' internally. It looks the sort of co. that
would do that kind of thing. Thus, to make assur-
ance doubly sure, it keeps its formal reserve fund
apart from the business. For the sake, perhaps, of
cultivating friendly relations with coastal shipping
cos., it has some of these funds in their shares, but
no less than £16,750 besides is in bank deposits
and public securities. Liabilities are also compara-
tively small. But here are all the balance-sheet
items in a few lines:—

Those assets are independent of the formal Reserve
Fund investments ( £19,000). The Pyrmont pro-
perty item shows how assets have been written down,
though, the land being leasehold, there is a special
reason for speed in that case. Considering the
nature of the business, the co. has very little locked
up in things that would be unrealisable and unpro-
fitable in the event of a bad slump in trade; and,
all round, the accounts are attractive. The manage-
ment, moreover, is markedly energetic, and it has
the knack of pulling strings in a trade which seems
to know a good deal concerning that doubtful branch
of gymnastics.

All shares in this co. now rank alike, the six years
for which an annual 10 p.c. was originally guaran-
teed on the prefs. having expired. The
profits and reserves as shown above put
the best face on the business. Apparently
the only provision for wear and tear is the
amount added to the reserve for depreciation; and if
this is so the true reserves are less than the reserves
mentioned above by the total amount of the depre-
ciation since the co. started. The accounts credit
the Depreciation Fund with £4061 for the half-
year ; and if that is a fair amount to write off, then
the profit for the half-year was £9516. And if the
amounts regularly set aside have been fair and pro-
per, then the true reserves are £35,680. Even this
is a handsome accumulation for seven years, consid-
ering that at the start the capital was only £77,500.
To-day it is £130,000, of which, however, about
£32,500 was got in only during the past six months.
This extra capital was certainly needed on account of
the rapid increase of business ; but in estimating future
probabilities it has to be considered whether things
are likely to be as brisk as they have been lately,
and the time may easily come when £130,000 will
be a big swag for the co. to carry. It hasn’t been
simply that the people in the timber trade have had
an exceptional turnover during the public and pri-
vate boom in construction; prices have also been
quite exceptional—and they became exceptional long
before there was much of an increase in costs. The
trouble is that those costs are likely to stay up
where they are long after the demand for timber,
etc., has eased off and competition has pulled prices
down. And in that connection it has to be remem-
bered that there is a heap more cap'tal in this tim-
ber business now than there was before the present
construction boom, wherefore competition is likely
to be much keener under normal conditions. It’s
the same, no doubt, in pretty well all lines; but
there is this difference —the people are not getting
in an over-supply of sausages or socks, whereas the
chances are they are getting in an over-supply of
offices and houses. So they will go on buying
sausages and socks—though not to the same extent
perhaps—whereas the construction of offices, etc., will
have to wait till the demand catches up to the
supply.
So much can be seen, but there is a good deal in
a balance-sheet such as H. McKenzie’s that can’t be
seen. The capital, as already mentioned, is £130,000 ;
the reserves of all sorts, before paying the dividend,
were £75,753 ; and the liabilities were £55,835.
Thus the assets, on the other side, were £261,588 :
and £138,053 of that was represented by stocks and
advances on timber. Some timber is fetching three
times as much as it did a while ago, and twice as
much as it may a few years hence; wherefore a
whole lot depends on the valuation of those stocks.
To a great extent the gamble lies there; and it’s all
right as long as the public recognises that it is a
gamble.

Mick Simmons, Ltd. (Sydney), dealers

Three things to be considered in connection with
this and most other investments are: (1) Are the
profits real? (2) What are the prospects? (3)
How is the principal secured? The widow and the
old man and some others ought to put the third
first. (1) The profits depend largely on the
stock-taking. Practically everything tangible that
the co. owns is stock, book debts or accessories, such
as fixtures. The assets (apart from goodwill) total
£102,820; £61,536 of this is stock and £18,339
is book debts. The managing director and another
certify to the quantities; apparently the managers
estimate the values, and the estimation of values
isn’t an exact science. Profits are, therefore, to this
extent a matter of estimation, too. Still, this is
not a business in which there ought to be any large
variation in values from day to day, and with quan-
tities checked it ought to be fairly easy to spot any
over-valuation. (2) The tobacco business goes on,
rain or fine, boom or burst. No doubt a nice stream
of profit from side-lines and extra-special brands
almost dries up in bad times ; but, on the whole, it
is a good business from this point of view. In pro-
portion to the capital in the concern, last year wasn’t
as good as the year before; and while appar-
ently nothing whatever was written off leases and
trade marks, which are wasting assets, the amount
put by was only a little more than a fourth of the
total dividend. There isn’t room for much more
shrinkage there if the 10 p.c. div. is to be legiti-
mately maintained. (3) As the table shows,
£14,794 of the capital is now unrepresented by
tangible assets = 3s. 3s. per share. The balance, as
shown just now, is nearly all in stock and other
perishables. There is no gilt-edged property to fall
back on in case things go wrong with the business.
The security is, therefore, of the sort that one could
reasonably expect to get more than 5 or 6 p.c. from.

The co.’s accounts put the matter rather differently;
but The Bulletin prefers its own way. The co.
itself claims funds amounting to £84,213 ; The
Bulletin’s idea is that they are considerably less.
Here is the explanation:—
Total accumulated funds .. .. .. £47,379

Total funds as per accounts .. .. £84,214
The written-up property may be worth the extra
money; but if the co. writes up one lot of property
when it happens to appreciate, it will be only a
fair thing to write down other property when it hap-
pens that the market doesn’t value it at 20s. in the
£. And there isn’t any evidence that the co. has
done anything in the latter direction. In any case,
when a co. writes up its property one year, and
writes it down by the same amount the next year, the
proceedings leave a nasty taste in the mouth. Still,
that happened a long while ago. But the transac-
tion with regard to the co.’s accident business didn’t
happen a long time ago; and, on the whole, it is
quite as doubtful. Had the co. been paid for this
very small business in cash, no complaint would be
lodged ; but the payment was made in scrip, and if
this scrip is worth one-third of its face-value, The
Bulletin will be glad to hear it. The shares which
this co. got in payment (1) are limited to 31 p.c. divi-
dend for 10 years; (2) are non-preferential and non-
eumulative; and (3) can’t be sold for 10 years. So
far as this paper knows, no dividend has ever been
paid on them. The only reference to this transaction
in the published accounts is among the assets: “In-
vestment in public company, £16,750.” The audi-
tors’ certificate attached to the balance-sheet says the
latter exhibits “a true and proper statement of the
co.’s position, subject to my report herewith,” and
the time is about ripe for insisting that, when an
auditor’s certification is “subject to my report,” the
report shall be printed along with the certificate. It
certainly ought to be insisted upon in connection
with a life-insurance office or any other co. which
accepts the public’s money on trust.
The co. nowadays separates its Ordinary and In-
dustrial busmess. The expenses in both sections are
high; lumping them together (which has to be done
in order to make a comparison with past years) we
get these results: —

There is further improvement for the year, with plenty
of room for it to continue. In the Industrial sec-
tion alone the claims paid were £5788, while the
expenses were £16,639. The total premiums were
£26,356. Of the premium income in this section
expenses thus absorbed £63 3s. p.c. It is a sad
business. Directors’ fees alone absorb more than
1 p.c. of the entire premiums. Some day, perhaps,
things may be better; and it is about time they
were, for the co. has been now 18 years in existence.

Australian Marine Fibres, Ltd.—The
promoters of this co. issued their prospectus in
February, 1911, and all their geese were swans. On
present appearances, some of them weren’t even
crows. They said there were vast quantities of fibre,
the remnants of a marine plant, the Posidonia Aus-
tralis, mixed with the sand in some of the shallows
of Spencer’s Gulf (S.A.). That was true enough.
They had acquired rights to dredge 20,160 acres,
from which, after making large deductions, they
figured on winning at least 528,000 tons. And it
may be true enough that that quantity is waiting
for them. Also, it may be quite true that three
dredges could get up 6000 tons of fibre a year at a
cost (including freight to Europe, etc.) of £ll 18s.
6d. per ton. But, as pointed out at the time, the x
in the problem was what the market would be pre-
pared to pay for the new material after it had been
dredged and cleaned and shipped. On that point
the promoters took far too much for granted. Appar-
ently the only foreign report the Australian syndicate
had was from certain indentors who said their in-
quiries showed there was “a practically inexhausti-
ble market in England and the Continent provided
large and regular quantities can be shipped and sold
to the manufacturers at a satisfactory quotation”—
which was so vague as to be a practically worthless
report from a commercial point of view. An Eng-
lish syndicate had, however, got a few reports from
people who mentioned 2d. and 3d. per lb. but didn’t
undertake to buy an ounce at even the lower price.
Nevertheless the promoters based their gaudy esti-
mates of profit on 2d. per lb., and black-lettered a
remark that the price would “probably be as much
as. 3d. per lb.”; and they alleged definitely: “Con-
tracts can be made at satisfactory prices as soon as
the co. is ready to give regular deliveries.” Further,
at the end of the first year, when there was, of
course, no fibre to offer, it was alleged, “Right
throughout the year offers of satisfactory prices have
been coming to hand.” Now, on the issue of the
second annual report, the co. is still hunting for a
market; the one dredge is idle; the managing direc-
tor, who has been sent to Europe and America to
“advance the co.’s interests,” sends reports which
“indicate that a market does exist, but at a lower
figure than that estimated [it was more than “esti-
mated,” by the way] in our prospectus” ; the sub-
scribed capital has all gone and the co. is a few
pounds in debt, and “the matter of providing funds
will require the immediate consideration of the in-
coming directors”; and the co. has got a tip that
a London firm is putting up £50,000 to start dredg-
ing, and “it would also appear that a contract has
actually been entered into by this firm with Conti-
nental manufacturers at a price below the minima tn
fixed by your directors.”
So it looks as if the whole scheme will have to he
remodelled. The co. has only one dredge, and is
not at all likely to get the money for another till a
market has been made. Costs are liable to be
greater than were estimated, labor, etc., being
dearer, and the return per lb. will be smaller. If
one dredge can turn out 6000 tons a year and the
co. can get 14d. per lb. for it at the old estimated
cost of £ll 18s. 6d. per ton, it would show £12,450
a year, instead of the £40,450 mentioned in the
prospectus. That’s the difference a ha’penny makes.
But one dredge probably will not produce 6000 tons;
in fact, one estimate put forward by the co. showed
under 3000 tons per dredge. [lt is true another
said 6666 tons, so vague and indefinite was ihe
whole business.] The present paid capital is
£107,410 in ss. shares. Of the 432,144 issued shaves
no less than 310,000 went to the promoters in pay-
ment for the leases, whose value was based on the
apparently fictitious 2d. or 3d. In any reconstnic-
tion, those promoters’ shares ought to be cut do vn
hard. There is still a hope for the co., but there is
very little if it has to carry this enormous quantity
of water. It has, it seems, now to compete with a
concern which is not burdened with goodwill, and
in a struggle for a new market with a concern of
that kind there can be only one end for an over-
loaded co. Into the real business of this Australian
Marine Fibres, Ltd., less than £30,000 of actual
money has been put; and under the altered circum-
stances, to expect less than £30,000 to pay fat
dividends on £107,500 is absurd. The chairman
of the co. is Senator Gould, who was also a promoter
and vendor; and it is up to him to do something
emphatic.
* » * *
Taylor Bros. Co-operative, Ltd. —This
co. was formed last year, as an offshoot from Taylor
Bros., Ltd., of Sydney, to acquire the business of the
latter co, outside N. S. Wales. Before it was floated
there were negotiations for the transfer of the whole
concern to Henry Jones Co-operative, Ltd., but terms
couldn’t be arranged. No great amount of factory
work was done outside N.S.W. by Taylor Bros., and
the Sydney co. apparently still feeds the offshoot
with goods ; but gradually more fruit is being boiled
at Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart. Probably on
account of some doubt as to whether the parent co.
wasn’t getting the better of the deal, only 20,000
shares ( £1) were subscribed for. The vendors took
10,000, 3000 of them representing goodwill. This
capital is not enough; hence liabilities totalling
£24,394 have been incurred. The first year’s trad-
ing having disclosed the handsome profit of £6070
-—a shade over 20 p.c.—10,000 of the unissued shares
are being sent to market at a premium of ss.—a
pretty stiff price to pay on the result of one year’s
trading. Some of the money will be used to buy a
freehold in Melbourne. This paper can’t see why
the co. should have been cut into two, and there
will probably be for some time a suspicion that one
is the dog and the other is the tail. But regarding
it as one animal, its outlook is excellent. It has
established a very high reputation for its goods;
and its goods are the sort that the public is likely
to want more and more of, mother having mostly
decided that it really doesn’t pay to make jam these
days.
The directors of the Colonial Sugar Re-
fining Co., probably to celebrate the defeat of the
Referenda and the desperately precarious return of
the Liberals, are asking shareholders to authorise
another 50,000 £2O shares; and as they are pro-
mised 12,500 of them straight away as a bonus,
there isn’t likely to be a riot about it. This will
make £825,000 of bonus capital presented to the
shareholders during the past 64 years, or equal to
nearly 6 p.c. p.a. on the capital as it stood in 1907 ;
and the dividend during that time has ranged from
10 to 124 p.c. But, of course, the bonuses have been
worth a great deal more than 6 p.c. p.a., for they
represent 41,250 shares, and shares are worth any-
thing over £4O. (They have been up to £46 dur-
ing the week.) Even on the capital as it stood in
1907 plus the amounts actually paid since then, the
present 124 P-c. dividend is really a 16 pc. divi-
dend ; and a co. that can pay 16 p.c., and still have
enough profit left over to make large distributions of
bonus shares, may well reckon itself in luck. And it
may reckon itself still more in luck if its luck con-
tinues. The time is, however, liable to come when
the grower of the sugar will kick as well as the
consumer; and when the grower kicks, and gets the
other farmers kicking with him, the outlook for the
C.S.R. will change seriously.

The recent behavior of the spelter market
isn’t at all pleasant. In June last year the average
price was £25 12s. ; in June of this year it was
£2l 19s. lOd; at the end of last week the price
was £2O TOs. And it looks as if the people with
large stocks on hand have little confidence in thi-
future. For more than a year past there has been
a huge pile of rich zinc concentrates at Burns, the
border station on the railway from Broken Hill to
the seaboard. It was given out that this stuff was
dumped there merely awaiting cheaper freights ; but
another explanation was that the market was being
propped up as long as possible. The speedv clear-
ing away of this great stack of metal suggests that
the owners want to cet in before things grow worse.
The fall is, in any case, a serious matter for Broken
Hill, which last year exported zinc of the net value
of £1,766,242 —almost exactly one-third of the
local value of the field’s entire output.
The statistician can be deceived by a
juggle sometimes. In Knibbs’s fine “Official Year

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

urnken Hill cos. Included in that list is “Broken
Hill South Extended, Ltd., £50,000." These are
fh. facts. Away back in the early days of the field
on English co., called the Australian B. 11. Consols,
ojnrked a claim from which some remarkable slabs
nf native silver were got, near the surface: and
from these finds £50,000 was paid in divs.—nearly
5, vears ago. That co. reconstructed two or three
times Finally, there being no hope left in the Con-
the people who had been running it decided to
fnrm themselves into a concern called the B. H. South
Extended, Ltd., and have a go at quite another sort of
mine iniles away from the other. To save winding
in the old concern they called it a reconstruction ;
and that is how the South Extended comes into the
distinguished company of dividend-payers. Off its
nwn bat, so to speak, it hasn’t made a bean : and it
; 8 by no means certain that it ever will.
The most important piece of work vet
carried out on the Ardlethan field (N.S.W.) is now
in progress at the Carpathia. From the bottom of
the main shaft crosscutting is in progress, and as
soon as the limits of the ore body are exposed driv-
ing will be commenced. This drive will reasonably
nrove the large block of ground above the 100 ft.
level by exposing it on three sides. To a very large
extent, the future of the district depends on the
next couple of months’ results at this level. De-
velopment work so far at the Carpathia has been
exceptionally favorable. The main shaft and open
cut have exposed a body of rich ore, but until the
drive at the 100 ft. level is in, there remains a doubt
as to whether all this work has not been done within
the limits of small pipes or lenses. No. 4 shaft
sunk on a pipe of contact material is opening out
well, and the average value of the lode material has
improved in depth.
The White Crystal Co. (Ardlethan) has lost the
services of genial Bill Gullock, the most experienced
man the field has yet had as a manager. Little
money is available, and less work is being carried
out. The tunnel through Crosby’s Hill has de-
finitely proved this knob of porphyry to be valueless.
The gathering in ot further funds promises to demand
more ingenuity than was even called for at the origi-
nal flotation of this show. It is certain that the
staff (managing director, mine manager, assayer,
mine foreman) have cut up more money than the
working miners.
Wild Cherry (Ardlethan) has confined operations
to Smith’s lode, on which a minimum of work is
being done. No attempt has yet been made to deter-
mine values and quantities. Wild schemes for erect-
ing plants and sinking main shafts are under way,
but up to the present the co. has carefully side-
stepped doing anything likely to prove its deposits.
The Homeward Bound has proved a well-defined
fissure containing a few small shoots —a decent pro-
position for a small syndicate of toilers. The South-
ern Cross is worth no more than it was at the
beginning. Unfortunately the numerous reported
finds of high-grade ore never remain long enough to
permit inspection.
Bygoo properties (Ardlethan) are quickly showing
their true values. Most of these syndicates operat-
ing at this end are hopeless. At Dumbrell’s Bygoo
the mania for sinking main shafts has again ended
in disappointment: the lode did not eventuate as
planned.
Generally, the field is suffering from incompetent
control and wasteful methods. The direction of the
mines is carried out in many cases by officials with-
out experience or qualifications except that they
have been interested in the flotation as vendors. Sev-
eral of the less-advertised shows, such as the Outcast,
will probably end up by proving to be better propo-
sitions than most of those which have been thrust
into the limelight.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
Ardlethan Options tells some truths that
a lew other Ardlethan ventures are still busy hiding.
From the last official report: “Ardlethan Group.-—A
new shaft has been sunk 40ft. on the kaolin pipe.”
Pipes? The mere suggestion that Ardlethan ore
occurred in pipes would have been yelled at a couple
of months ago. Then: “Bygoo Group.—On Dum-
brell’s lease, as the shaft did not strike the rich
deposit at 60ft., it was decided to follow the ore, and
after bagging 10 tons of from 40 to 50 per cent, ore,
one end of the deposit disappeared on a slippery wall
of hard country rock. A few days later it was found
to have stepped or slipped down 7ft. It broke into
two seams of 12in. and sin.” In other words, the
body breaks up into fingers at comparatively shallow
depth, just as it was expected that it would on this
part of the field.
New Burragorang, Yerranderie (N.S.W.),
has lately shipped two small lots of ore to Cockle
Creek, assaying 60-84 oz. silver and 29-45 p.c. lead.
Gold values run a trifle over 2dwt. The co.
was floated mainly on the strength of boundary
prospects in the neighboring Yerranderie, which has
produced a few thousand tons of good ore from
narrow veins to a depth of 1300 ft. The most im-
portant feature of recent development has been . the
connecting of No. 4 west level with the parent mine’s
workings. At No. 1 west stoping is being continued
on a 4in. vein of ore carrying good values. The
shaft is now being deepened, and there is a fair
prospect of a moderate tonnage of good qre being
got below 600 ft. But the veins are so narrow and
the tonnage possible so small that the field is quite
unsuited for heavy capitalisation. And what tonnage
there is is subject to very heavy freight.
Adelong Creek Dredging Co. is making a
record that touches the “tonier” Adelong Estates
on the raw. The latter, though higher up the
stream, can’t hit much gold, whereas the Dredging
Co. is pulling up dirt and is promising better.
But Gordon Lyon and his cohorts aren’t out for
dividends just yet, because a wad of debentures have
to be lifted. So the co.’s profit of £2984, earned
during the half-vear, is used to pay off bonds, and
maybe to pave the way for building a needed No. 2
dredge. The co. owns a slab of well-prospected
Around, and with less water than its Adelong Es-
tates brother is doing well, while its neighbor is
poising on a bar.
For June, Great Cobar (N.S.W.) had the
best return this year—6o7 tons copper, 22640 z. gold,
10,3000 z. silver. Taking gold at 80s. and silver at 25.,
prec’ous metals average £l6 12s. per ton of copper.
What this represents per ton of ore cannot be told,
because Great Cobar doesn’t publish its tonnage
every month ; but the quarterlv returns show a very
low extraction of copper. For the first three months
of this year it is known that 88,419 tons had to be
treated to get 1450 tons. This is the biggest input of
any copper concern in Australia. What is most
necessary is an improvement in the method of con-
centrating low-grade silicious ore; and progress that
way is very slow. Some of the American mills the

doubt the co. expected at one time
that it would be able to secure the Bourke’s Hill
property as a dumping ground for its excessively
sloppy slimes; but Bourke’s Hill improved, and
hope for relief in that direction has gone. The
disposal of the slimes, etc., will be an increasing
trouble, and extra costs are therefore liable to eat
up a bit of what has hitherto been available for
profits.

Junction North has made extensive
sales of its slime products, and, though it would be
an advantage to have figures showing what smelting
charges, etc., have been figured on, it is some relief
to know that there is a market for the stuff. The
co. has considerable dumps of the material, and as
progress payments are to be made, shareholders’
pockets will be left alone for some time to come.

Lor the first time in eight half-years
divdends have exceeded calls on Bendigo. The
amount to the good was £3482. Local people point
with pride to the call list being the lowest on re-
cord ; but disinterested outsiders argue from this
that Bendigo’s once-plucky speculators will no longer
pay for prospecting or dead work. There are 12
div.-paying mines in Bend go and eight others get-
ting gold enough to mention; all the other 80-odd
are either working half-time or waiting till the
strike is settled, or some other old thing happens.
* * * *
There is something pathetic about the slow
decay of Bendigo; and the cold truth is it will go
on unless side-line work finds support. Deep sinking
has had its day, and has established that below
3000 ft., in nearly all the mines, the shoots of stone
shorten and gold contents fall off tremendously. Cen-
tral Red, White and Blue remains top dog
of the field with £19,200 paid in divs. during the
last six months. The healthiest sign is that as the
Central Blue’s star has been setting, the Pyke group
has arisen to help up yields and spur a poverty-
stricken lot of jobbers to fresh effort.

Central Catucart, Ararat, enters the divi-
dend list with a 2s. payment. Apropos the current
enthusiasm, The Bulletin asks whether all the con-
fidence rests on truck results got from the different
wash-dirt drives opened up and down the gutter. It
doesn’t mind handing over an inch or two of its
space for official information on this point. As far
as one can judge, two years will work out the pre-
sent length of lead opened out. At 2s. per month,
that means 48s. —provided yields keep up. Why
doesn’t the Board hurry up the boring, to see just
where the gutter does go in (or out of) the claim ?
Two dredges of the Junction Co., working
near Bright (Vic.), earn profits at the rate of 40
p.c. on the paid-up capital. Last half-year’s div. of
4s. brought the total to £3 13s. per share. If the
outcry against dredging in the Victorian cabbage
garden dies out, no valid reason exists why the
Junction shouldn’t heap up a pile more profits. But
with the two Melbourne dailies frothing about the
destruction of land, dredge-mining in the Bright dis-
trict looks blue.
In all 35 workers were killed and 491
more or less mangled by the Westralian mining in-
dustry in 1912. Fourteen deaths were due to falls
of rock, etc.; *lO were classed as miscellaneous,
eight were due to accidents in shafts, and three to
explosions. Of the 491 injured men who escaped
with their lives 284 were hurt underground and
114 on the surface. Of the total, 329 were in-
jured at Kalgoorlie. When is that Miners’ Acci-
dent Fund coming? N. S. Wales has had an excel-
lent scheme at work for 12 or 15 years, and the
best thing Westralia can do is to adopt it holus
bolus, instead of wasting more years conferring and
otherwise yapping as to whether this man or
that should pay Id. a week more or less. The
Government has now got the business in hand, and
if the men behind the Government are wise they
will not quibble about farthings or try to dress the
scheme with superfluous trimmings.
As predicted, Ida H. (W.A.) has gone
from bad to worse. Last month the return averaged
385., and as working costs absorbed 40s. Bd. per ton
there was a debit of £177. Another manager, mak-
ing the third in two years, has retired, and the taSk
set his successor of trying to make money for share-
holders looks hopeless. In fact, the luck of the whole
Laverton field seems to be dead out. It is not long
since the Lancefield had to shut down for want of
cash, suitable plant and other things, and now
the belief is becoming general that there is something
wrong with the old Augusta mine. This property is
owned by a Melbourne and Sydney co., and about a
year ago a director declared, after a visit, that there
was plentv of gold-bearing stone to keep a 20-head
mill going indefinitely, or thereabouts. This opinion
was confirmed by the manager, but dissented from by
The Bulletin, which asserted that the length of
the shoot was not more than the width of George-
street, and that the mill would soon crush it out of
existence. Subsequently it was officially announced
that ore treatment would be started before the end
of 1912, but the prediction was unfulfilled. _ Any
information concerning the doings or intentions of
the co. would be gladly received by interested
Westralians. Another Laverton mine which is being
inquired about is the Lady Harriet, owned by the
Marv Mac Co., of Melbourne. A good deal was said
at time of flotation about what this show was
going to do, and a fair assortment of new and
second-hand machinery was subsequently installed. A
little later it was given out that costs would prob-
ably not exceed 12s. per ton. Since then there has
been a deathly silence. # *
Edna May (W.A.) hopes to handle 1200
tons a month with its second-hand crushing_plant_
Assuming that a recoverable grade of 70s. is main-
tamed and costs do not exceed £1 per ton, this
should mean a monthly profit of £3OOO. How long
such a performance can be kept up depends entirely
on how the shoot opens up in depth; but, mean-
time, a strenuous attempt will probably be made to
make the market soar a bit h.gher. The reserve
shares will very likely be panned out then.
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) is now speeding
development, and claims that recent crosscutting
and driving at 100 ft. has proved the No. 2, or south-
ern series, to be of very great extent, one drive
apparently across the lode averaging 40s. for a
length of 50ft. The management also asserts that
the original work done on this series at 200 ft. was
t°° ar *"° nor th, and a crosscut is being ex-
tended south at that level to pick up the large makes
of ore now being opened up at 100 ft. Managing-
director Doolette and general-manager Morgan are
very sanguine as to the result of this work.
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) states that
during the last quarter developments in the higher
levels have been encouraging. The bottom workings,
however, do not show any improvement, and the ore
so far developed in this part of the mine is below
the average of 275. 2d. that is being sent to the
mill. Enormous quantities of low-grade ore are
exposed in the property, but a good deal of it would
not to treat under present conditions.
Associated Northern (W.A.) expects to
strike values in its No. 5 level crosscuts at Ora
Banda at any time. At the No. 4 level the length of
the rich shoot was under 200 ft., but judging by the
winzes that have been put down from that point, it
is more than likely that there will be a greater
stretch of gold-bearing ground at the No. 5.
Luptons’ (W.A.) mournfully announces
that, owing to the failure of shareholders to stump
up calls, it had, during the past half-year, to rely
solely on the treatment of old tailings to pay its
debts. These debts having been discharged, it is
now proposed to deepen the main shaft. To do this
a trifle more capital is needed, and in order to raise
it the Board has been authorised to dispose of the
27,000 forfeited shares and to call up the remaining
capital of the co. Meantime, the members of the
Board and a few supporters still cling to the hallu-
cination that the mine will yet become a profitable
venture.
Marvel Loch (W.A.) raked in £12,720 for
the half-year ended April, of which £9833 came
from gold won, £668 from public crushing, £1974
from calls and £245 from sale of water. The debit
balance on working account was £440. A state-
ment of products on hand shows that there is an
accumulation of 51 tons of concentrates estimated
to be worth £458 and 7000 tons of slimes worth
10s. per ton. Some complimentary remarks are made
in the report about the prospects of the Comet
option, but if half of what The Bulletin hears is
true these remarks are unwarranted. As for the
co.’s present property, its chances of being profitable
to shareholders remain as doubtful as ever. In
fact, next door to hopeless.
* * * *
Charters Towers likes a gamble, and its
old market horse, Kelly’s Queen Block, which has
been making monthly penny calls, appears likely to
provide one. The St. George reef is showing better
prospects, and three stopes carry heavily-mineralised
stone for a width of 14in. Anything like a big
make of ore should be worth sinking on, for the
St. George crushed very well when originally
worked in the ground adjoining Kelly’s. A crosscut
for the Brilliant cross reef at No. 2 level is also
going in under a very profitable area of ground
worked by tributors.
Queensland’s output of wolfram is likely
to get a push. A representative of Blackwell & Sons
(Eng.) has been through the wolfram districts near
Cairns proclaiming that his firm is out to
buy all the wolfram it can fix on for the tungsten
and molybdenite steel industry. Tungsten is used
in tool steel and molybdenite in armor-plate and
projectile steel, and both are in big demand. Hence
the word to Northern Queensland to hustle and
scratch.
* * * *
There are half-a-million or more tons of
Mount Morgan tailings that some local people think
are worth squeezing again for gold, and a syndicate
has bought the right to have a turn at them. They
seem to vary greatly in value, from under two
’weights up to five or six, and in patches go more.
Sluicing was at first suggested, but it is doubtful
whether that will do ; so a filter process is now being
looked into.
* * * *
Lode Hill (N.Q.) has been floated in Mel-
bourne in 100,000 shares of 10s. each. In private
hands this show has teen a success because the
decomposed granite containing a little tin oxide was
very easily sluiced and the owners toiled hard to get
a good supply of water. The output has, however,
been small, and it is for the new co. to prove that
it can be made much larger without cutting into the
small percentage of profit.
The Standard Consolidated, an English
concern which owns some very promising tin shows
outside Charters Towers (Q.), under-estimated the
cost of development and equipment in the old way,
and at latest the directors were urging shareholders
to take up another 20,000 shares. A 10 p.c. prefer-
ence was offered, with other privileges. The money
was wanted promptly; but, though 14,000 shares
were said to be underwritten, the mine doesn t look
as though it had been informed of any inrush of
monev. Still, something is pretty sure to be done;
having got the mine and plant to their present
pointf it will be madness to cry off without letting
a stamper drop. *
“M C ” * The scheme to amalgamate
Hercules'and Primrose mines (Tas.) with the Tas-
manian Smelting Co. fails to arouse much enthusi-
asm for it is perfectly understood that it implies
concentration of the crude ore. G. H. Blakemore
gave a more guarded estimate of reserves at the Her-
cules than Manager Moxon, who figures 322,000 tons
averaging 71 p.c. lead, 24 p.c. zinc, 12oz. silver.
There is also plenty of iron. Laboratory experiments
show that 40 p.c. of the original ore can be recov-
ered as a concentrate containing 50 p.c. zinc, with
4 p.c. lead, while the balance of the crude ore will
give a concentrate containing 15.9 p.c. lead, 15.4
p.c. zinc, and 22.9 p.c. iron. The adoption of the
Minerals Separation process in conjunction with the
German process for recovering zinc oxide from
slag would, of course, involve heavy expense. 'I he
profits, according to P. S. Morse, are likely to be
small, even with spelter at £25, and a small profit
makes it imperative that ore reserves should be
larger than those known to exist in the Hercules and
Primrose mines.

Auckland people are roping in some
Svdnev people to help them develop another coal-
mine at Westport (M.L.). Maoriland certainly
wants more coal, and the mineral got at Westport
is of a very high class ; but the country thereabout
has had serious convulsions at some time or other,
and the Westport Co. in its early days had a hard
fight for its life. The new proposition, though it
has a lot to recommend it, isn’t therefore the dead-
sure thing that it may -look on the surface.
From Manila, in- the Philippines: The
Melbourne co. which owns the Paracale bucket-dredg-
ing show is in trouble. It sent up a new dredge,
but the thing had hardly got to work before it sank,
and at high tide the decks are awash. A section of
the damaged hull has been cut off and converted
into a lighter: the rest of the hull is beyond re-
nair The machinery is being shifted. The co. has no
luck The inexcusable accident to the new dredge,
the fact that the local supply of wood will soon be
exhausted, necessitating the purchase of coal from
Japan or Australia, together with the lawsuit pend-
ing as to the best part of the lately-acquired terri-
tory, make a combination of troubles that will take
much overcoming. The Maoriland co. which origi-
nally owned the ground had a somewhat similar
series of mishaps, due largely to the parsimony and
ineptness of the management in Dunedin. Though
the co. took out £40,000, it never paid a dividend.
Better things were looked for when the Melbourne
people took over the properties; and, although the
co. is too heavily watered, yet with competent man-
agement big profits should be made. Another Philip-
pine proposition, the Umerai Dredging Co., has its
head office in Sydney. It owns a group of claims
on the Umerai River, on the Island of Luzon. An
engineer was sent to test the ground; and on the
strength of an inadequate trial the co. was formed and
a dredge has been, or is being, built by Poole and
Scott, of Balmain. In the prospectus considerable
importance was attached to the fact that a co. was
operating some hydraul c ground above the property
of the dredging co. Big results were anticipated from
this hydraulic ground. These roseate prospects have
not been realised; in .fact, the hydraulic co. is a
failure. In view of this and of the poor test the
Sydney co.’s ground has had, I would strongly re-
commend that the Umerai Co. send up a capable man
equipped with a Keystone drill to thoroughly bore
the ground. A power drill is necessary on account
of the boulders in the river bed. A hand drill is of
no use whatever. It would be nothing short of folly
to send up the dredge until this boring has been
done.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 7, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
An epidemic of possible chicken-pox is dis-
arranging the left, or vaccination, arm lin-
gerie of two-thirds or so of the community.
The awkwardness of being one-armed for a
few days, and the hyper-sensitive shudder
of the citizen who sees even the best-look-
ing girl in a tram move up alongside his
punctures, are phases of the present trou-
ble. A strong-minde*d acquaintance, who
tramped up to the Board of Health lymph
department the other afternoon, offered her
leg as a sacrifice. ‘The doctors are doing
the left arm,” said the Nightingale in at-
tendance. “I can’t spare my arm,” replied
the “but they’re welcome to my
leg.” She firmly extended the socket of a
knee-joint to one of the young lancets, and
sat down to let the punctures dry, while the
throng peeled off its outer layer of blouse or
jacket, and submitted to be punctured. The
story of the leg flew round the premises,
and started a fashion in knee joints.
A queue four deep heard the glad tidings,
and it cast quite a glamor over mere vac-
cination. “Did it hurt, missis?” said the
Mother of Six. “Mum, let’s have our legs
done,” yelled Young Hopeful, while the
Baby bawled, and the intermediate' sizes
wailed that they didn’t want to have stuff
stuck into them anywhere.
Strong young men, also maidens in their
prime, such as those who sat on the Cliff
House balconies and wept over the fate of
Mr. Snook, strolled in together to the
Board of Health’s last Saturday At Home.
Edwin turned pale when the arm—fresh, fat
and freckled—of Angelina, had to be stabbed,
and a sickly smile spread across his noble
countenance when his own turn came. The
feminine Vaccinated, leaning on the sound
arm of the male Vaccinated, departed in
doleful couples—not because they were
much damaged, but because they expected to
be, and were waiting for the “symptoms.”
“Where do they get the stuff from?” asks
Angelina timidly. “Oh, I b’lieve they kill a
few calves,” says her swain, vaguely, though
he really isn’t quite sure that they don’t
slay some elephants. “It’ll send the price
o veal up _ somethin’ terrible! I hear as
they’re killin’ young beasts in hundreds to
get the small-pox stuff out of ’em!” chips
in a motherly person with a basket on one
arm and a yelling infant on the other. The
only dead faint recorded at this party was
of the male persuasion.
The folk of the Asche-Brayton Co. had
their sleeves rolled up in private, and were
able to wave vaccination certificates in the
face of any minion who tried to stave off
their departure from this State. Mr. Joe
Cook did not have his majority of one
operated on before leaving Sydney. Con-
cerning these troubles an Experienced Trav-
eller tells this tale of a majority of the same
size which his presence of mind once saved
for S’African affairs. He was tripping in
Maoriland when the great small-pox scare
struck these islands a foul blow some years
ago, and everywhere the news was hung
on the outer battlements that travellers re-
turning from Ward’s Own Country must
appear in their Australian port duly and
successfully vaccinated. It was a 'much-
vaccinated company that filled the steamer
at the Bluff, and among them were three
members of the Natal Parliament who were
hastening back to be in time for the opening
of the session. At Melbourne two of
them—both Oppositionists—were passed, but
the third —a Government supporter—was
carried raging into quarantine. He hadn’t
“taken.” Now the Government was hang-
ing on by the Speaker’s casting vote, or
something of the sort, and this meant ruin.
Ihe two Oppositionists, being strangers in
a strange land, appealed to the Experienced
Iraveller for advice. His view was simple
and to the point: “Leave your misguided
friend, and hurry back to Natal and upset
the Government.” But they declared that
that wouldn’t be playing the game, so my
friend saw George Turner and William
Lyne, and told them of the absurd fate of
two politicians who didn’t know the rudi-
ments of the political business. And they
laughed consumedly, and kindly told some-
one else, and the someone else tolled the bell
or called the ambulance or something of the
sort. In the end the misguided majority
was taken out in a small boat, and
thrown cautiously on board the outgoing
steamer. Sad to say he was still raging.
The R. H. Todds made a breathless de-
parture by express to catch the Orient liner
along the Australian _ coast. Violet Ross-
Johnson, a brainy artist-journalist, went off
with the Todd menage for Europe, and won’t
return here for a possible two years. She is
voing to saunter through ancient cities and
.lot down her impressions of life in Vienna
Paris and other picturesoue villages with a
past. Hi. and Mrs. Maxwell Allan have
taken Woodlands, the Todd cottage, till the
wanderers hurry home again. They will
see that the ferocious Irish terrier puts out
the cat and milk jug till the family bustles
back to the domestic hearth in six or seven
months. *
The recent Pymble bride of the Titian
locks, Mrs. David Pagan—who was Hilda
Kowe last month—is launched on the bumpy
track of housekeeping, with sufficient plate
to start a small silver mine. This was the
wedding gift of her eldest brother. The
Customs duties on these luxuries is alleged
to have run into a mere £3OO more or less.
Probably less, though the first glimpse of
the goods nearly turned the brain of a usu-
ally calm young person who saw them
taken out of their travelling wraps. Every-
thing was there that the heart of woman
could desire, if she sat down for a month
and envied every other woman she knew, and
called to mind all the first Thursdays and
last Mondays of Woollahra Point and Darl-
ing Point and the solid silver thereof. Every
article is stamped with the bride’s mono-
gram. I mention this to discourage anyone
who attempts to get away with a few
samples after dynamiting the strong-room in
which they are at present housed.
The Le Page-Bauer wedding, the other
day, scintillated with the flash of naval iron-
mongery as the bridal pair ducked their
heads under the usual chilly avenue of cold
steel. The groom is one of the H.AI.S.
Psyche contingent of defenders. He is Mr.
C. H. Le Page, a lieutenant on that small
craft. The bride, Dora, is the only daughter
of the Otto Bauers, whose domicile is out
Woollahra way. There’s one son, by the
way. Airs. Bauer used to be a Aliss Alil-
son, of the North Sydney clan. This family
gave its name to the Point where the penny
ferry bumps against the pier-head, and the
voice of the “Hurry up there!” fiend rages
round a banging gangway. The Alilsons
used to own a good deal of the earth in that
water-lapped shore. The original hairy an-
cestor must, have squatted in those parts
when the chief noise of traffic was the click
of oars, as a boat was pulled across the bay
in front of his domain. The Le Page-
Bauer wedding breakfast was eaten in the
presence of two Admirals and their ladies —
our soon-departing King-Hall and the globe-
trotting Barlow —and some extensive bullion
from the little Psyche.
Alaster in Equity 11. P. Owen has snatched
six months’holiday. He means to hurry otf to
Europe forthwith. Barrister Owen belongs to
a tough legal family, which has various law-
yers in its domestic locker. His father, the
late District Court Robert Owen, had con-
siderable interest in coal, by the way, and
once owned a large supply of that combus-
tible material down Wollongong way. He
made money out of it, too. That was be-
fore the small-pox came, and all coal had to
be vaccinated previous to delivery.
Samuel AlcCaughey (pronounced, I be-
lieve, Mackakkey), the veteran Knight of
Yanco, has been revolving round the recent
sheep show. He is one of the sturdiest
youngsters of his age (which is somewhere
near 80) in this State. The reputation of
growing more wool than any other man in
this continent hasn’t caused the Mackakkey
to shed a hair of the bushy white eyebrows
that hang over a pair of keen, china blue
eyes.
Dr. Flashman’s square, bull-colored house,
on the knoll that peers over the Rose Bay
links, has been sold to a Captain Lloyd. I
fancy he used to be something in the Navy.
This is almost as vague as the indeterminate
occupation known as “Something in the
city,” which includes everything, from an
organ-grinder to a stockbroker, but it doesn’t
affect the facts of the case. The purchaser
told someone he fancied Drylaw, because it
reminded him of an English farmhouse.
Everyone to his taste. A N.S.W. magnate,
who had been a lucky digger, once bought a
Queen Anne villa because it had a mid-
Victorian top storey trimmed with wood-
work that was reminiscent of a mine poppet-
head. Mrs. Flashman, by the way, is one
ot the Dewar whisky family.
The Admiralty lady will pour out tea
from four to six to-day, Monday. Alan o’
War steps is the jumping-off place for this
revel.
. The National Council of AVomen preened
its feathers at Government House the other
afternoon. Lady Edeline Strickland took
wV&VF • Nolan > a PiHar of the
H.E.1.L., sighed over the pernicious habits
ot the beery one, who wants his liquor often
and breathed a hope that, before long, 8 pm'
would see the publican putting up his shut-
teis. Ihe White. Slave traffic was more than
hinted at. In this subject there lurks much
mud, which was discreetly stirred with all
the enthusiasm that the Council of Gnats
could collect in its handbags. Dr. Marion
Thornett added a firm codicil to the Nolan
will.
Lecturer Joseph McCabe has been filling
the gloomy precincts of the Protestant Hall
with tales of long ago, when fishes climbed
trees, and the ape-man whisked his tail at
primeval nut orgies. The hall has been too
small for the audiences—alwavs a joyous
experience for managements. “The Romance
A UStl^r ll ?, , \ is P oss ibl,v the most alluring
of . the AlcCabe subjects. Did you know
Arim, that once upon a time, a few billion
j/ears ago, the fish was the great-grand-
father of mammals and birds and all the
animal peerage? Queensland still grows a
iish with a lung—relic of the days when
Mr. and Mrs. Schnapper walked about
Bananaland on their fins, or climbed a gum
tree to watch the tide come in.
Hugh Ward, as the high priest of the
Women’s Hospital relief fund, wore a smile
like a benediction or an open carpet bag
when he got behind Her Majesty’s footlights
the other afternoon. “Just £3B wanted to
make up £2OOO in the house —a record, I
think, for Australia,” said the managerial
voice. No one contradicted this statement.
“Only £38 —come, we’ll make that and a bit
over,” persisted the enthusiastic Ward.
Madge Titheradge, a charming creature with
a silky voice made of whipped cream and
velvet and kittens’ fur, timidly auctioneered
a leather-bound volume with the priceless
aid of comedian Percy. A mild-looking man
in the d.e. got possession of this trifle, which
contained the photos (hand-signed) of lead-
ing mummers for a mere song, so to speak—
£so. The enternrising bidder was Mr. Albert
Sluice. Geo. Titheradge recited a fine ode
(it’s too heroic to be described as a poem)
by Adam McCay, called “Woman.”
Lewis Waller made his first bob to Aus-
tralian audiences at this Women’s Hospital
matinee. Time is beginning to pepper his
romantic side hair with a few flecks of grey
7 —otherwise the Appearance is quite in keep-
ing with its reputation. The Waller figure
is tall, slim, and well set up, and shows a
decided waist in the frock coat of after-
noon wear. He hurled Kipling’s “Ballad of
the Camperdown” at an audience that was
so crowded together (at anything from
six guineas a seat) that you couldn’t have
slipped a paper knife between the gallery
heads without slicing off an ear or two.
Mrs. Grace Miller Ward waited at the head
of the stairs to meet royalty—l mean politi-
cal royalty, in the persons of Premier Hol-
man and his wife. Every entrance to Her
Majesty’s was strongly entrenched with
sellers of anything saleable for the fund.
Little Mrs. G. E. Goodman occupied a com-
manding position, and exchanged pro-
grammes for shillings. By this time, the
Women’s Hospital secretary is so busy count-
ing the ton or two of cash that has flowed
into _ the formerly-empty treasury, that he
hasn’t had time to go down on his front
hinges and thank the Benefactors.
The Women’s Hospital matinee (Little
Theatre) extracted £330 admission money.
The extraction was done without pain or
chloroform. It wasn’t even necessary to use
a corkscrew. Miss Eadith Walker declared
the performance to be well and truly laid,
and stated that the foundation-stone was
open, and that the seven lamps of benevo-
lence were lit. The sale n f programmes,
sweets and so forth is scheduled at £62.
This is another proof, if anybody wants
such a thing, that pence make pounds. How
the shillings tot up that fritter away in a
good cause may be easily reckoned without
wearing your fingers to the bone counting
them. The date first arranged was July 5
This was altered to July 2. The Butt-
Bumford pair added their melodious voices
to the occasion. The Chief Justicess Cullen,
with the youthful eldest daughter of Governor
Strickland, were included in the throng.
The moneyed George Earps, who are inter-
ested in the fortunes of the Little Theatre,
also gave their countenance and cash to the
event. Countenance is a great thing, but
cash is better.
The Queen Victoria Club’s rally round Mr.
Joe Cook resounded with the wail of dirge-
like music the other afternoon. “Why don’t
they give us something cheerful—‘See the
Conquering Cook’ or something like that’”
asked a buxom dame under the brim of her
best hat. “I knew Mr. Cook when he used
to be a Labor member,” remarked another
visitor. A dreadful silence followed this
tactless speech. The stronghold of Liberal
tea and toast turned a chilly'shoulder away
from this horrible reminiscence. Whether
any ladies present were carried home in a
dead faint report forgets to mention. No-
body really believed it, of course—still—
well —there you are !
The Peace Society held its usual monthlv
meeting the other day. 'President Rose
Scott distributed benign smiles on the
assembly. A gentleman named Alexander
who is _ followed by the learned tail “b!
Science," flung in a whirling contribution
per penny post from Maoriland. He rejoices
greatly over the “dead failure” (?) tliat is
baulking the efforts of harassed area officers
in M.L. “Lads who will not drill” are the
heroes of the Alexander screed. The pity of
it is that some day a nation in arms will
hrivG to fight for the lives and freedom of
these wrong-headed young cubs.
Why not hold the next reace Conference at
Constantinople?—where a shamed and crip-
pled Government, which has just given away
the best part of its empire through insufficient
preparation, is gnawing its nails in anger
and using remarks unfit for publication. Or
Soba might be a good spot. The peaceful
person who rushed forward to hurl a
pamphlet in the teeth of an infuriated Bul-
garian might lose a leg or Wm. but he’d ad-
vertise his _ peaceful intern ions far better
than by sitting down in safety in a
non-combatant town. Again, why not make
Mexico the scene of the conference? That
country once had 2GO revolutions in ah
50 years, and it is starting to revolve aua
at the old address. The great point aboi
Mexico is that it has no compulsory militav
service, and everything is voluntary. g e t.
ral dozen dead Presidents remarked i
their last moments that things were a gren
deal too voluntary, and that the popula
and untrained enthusiasm was being over
done.
Government House at Port Moresh
(Papua) is going to be a new and reforme!
edition of the rather dreary shed which use<
to house the sub-Governor of that rubber
tyred Possession. Whether it rears mos
quito-proof walls to the waters of the turtle
haunted sea report doesn’t say. But it
airy apartments will be built on a highe
site than the former Imperial humpy. fr™
J. H. P. Murray, wife of Papua’s long whip
chief, is an amateur photographer who eai
show a few professionals some points ii
composing a picture. Most of the illustra
tions in the chief’s recent book, “Papua’
(which contains 379 pages of solid informa
tion re the Stone Age habits of aborigina
society), are from her camera. The Murrai
family departs hence for Moresby this week
Kensington golf links are turning i nt(
dry land again. The recent flood—a linea
descendant of the original b.c. flood is
abating, and the lakes which drowned the
goffers’ balls are removing themselves fron
various suburban links. The first fortnight
in August will be the scene of a mighty gofl
combat at Kensington.
On Saturday night the Town Hall echoes
were quiet. A packed organ loft and a full
eastern gallery balanced the waves of sound
that wander round those latitudes when
business isn’t humming. The Butt voice
w r as in double forte form. The elegant
Ivennerley Rumford, in spite of an occa-
sional trace of hoarseness, due to a heavy
week, with two charity matindes as vocal
extras, made the hit of his present season
here. This was in his spirited interpretation
of “Largo A 1 Factotum” from “The Barber
of Seville.” Rumford was a revelation in
this dramatic warble, a mile or two ahead of
his rather stiff attack on the dull German
songs which have been the solid meat of pre-
vious programmes. The majestic Clara,
clothed like Mrs. Solomon (I suppose there
was a principal missis to the gorgeous king)
in all her. glory, flashed like a conning
tower of gems, and illuminated the plat-
form with about one million candle-power of
diamonds. The contralto cannot do any-
thing better (and her best is hard to beat)
than Handel’s “Rendi’l Sereno” and charm-
ing trifles like “The Fairy Pipers.” Tru-
man climbed over the bodies in the organ
seats to get to the municipal wind instru-
ment, when the voice pulled out its
lowest stops for “Abide With Me.” Jlis.
Clara’s phrasing of this noble theme misses
the Kirkby Lunn gospel of perfection.
Artist Ethel Stephens recently painted a
portrait of her father, the late Prof. W. J.
Stephens.. This w-as presented by the lady
to the Linnsean Society, which lias an old
affection for his memory. The late W. J.
Stephens (who died in 1890) was head-
master of Sydney Grammar School when it
was cutting its first verbs. Later, he passed
up to Sydney. Uni. as Professor of Natural
History. His skill in diagnosing the do-
mestic habits of insects, the romance of a
rock, or the three-volume story that may be
written round an extinct volcano, made him
an hereditary grand-master of, any Linnsean
Society—hence the recent hanging in the
local headquarters of that learned body.
Ihe photo from which the portrait was
painted was one of which the Stephens
family had no knowledge. A sister of the
late Prof, was turning over some old prints
in a picture shop, when she came upon a
photo which she had never seen before. She
secured it, and it was considered good enough
to serve as a study for the oil painting now
in the Linnaean Hall.
An Australian abroad sends a fierce pro-
test re the Maryan millinery. “The Queen’s
special taste in hats is for the plateau type.
At the recent review.of the Guards in Hyde
i ark H.M. wore, with rather a handsome
c e aa ’- a fHt red felt monstrosity with a small
tuft of navy blue lying around it. The red
was the one shade that no one can success-
fully wear, and while everyone else’s trim-
ming soared aloft, the headgear of Majesty
drooped in a limp heap, perched on a dizzy
inch or two of coiffure. In spite of her
taste m hats, one must admire Queen Mary
tor the masterful way in which she has
broken a rather restive crowd (“the
©mart ,jet ’) to wholesome hours and some
semblance of domestic habits. Also, one
quails before the firm rule of a lady who
* ac /' e< 3 down (by proxy) the sacred walls
ot Magdalen to get a bathroom for her son,
while mere dons could only avert their horri-
fied eyes and wait for the heavens to fall
as the next event. Mostly, I admire the pale
rose of her complexion, translucent still,
despite her 45 years, the rare forget-me-not
blue of her eyes, and the sunny brown of
her hair. But model as she is in many
respects, no woman on earth can ever hanker
to copy her hats. One wishes she would
open bazaars in her crown, in which she
looks regal.”
Yours affectionatel v.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, July 7, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The State Parliament reassembled last
Wednesday with the usual parish pomp.
Governor Fuller, cheerful and spruce in
spite of the useless job he had to do, almost
pranced across Queen’s Hall to the Council
Chamber, where abject officials backed be-
fore him like careful dray horses pushing a
load up a narrow lane. Aides “Tommy”
Curwen and “Curly” Crespin (everybody
refers to them affectionately in this way)
were beautifully upholstered in military
clothes, and walked proudly in front of the
procession. The Fuller lady being away,
the attempted solemnities attracted only a
few fur-clad women. Mrs. J. M. Davies
entertained them at tea in the lobbies. Mrs.
Hennessy, heavily feathered, went first with
her Gaud Mayor. Mrs. Walter Manifold
wore the newest Queen Bess frill in the
collar of her furs. Speaker Madden’s lady,
in sombre black garments, brought daughter
Vera dimpling in blue. The Frank Duffy
daughters, a navy blue pair, took tea grate-
fully after the excitement of listening to
Pa. Jack Thompson, of Hamilton, brought
his wife —one of the handsome Robertsons,
of the Western District. His sister, Mrs.
Laidlaw, was also on hand to see the Legis-
lative wheels set going. Mrs. Aitken, all in
blue, wore a foot-high osprey in her hat.
Mrs. Hodges was the centre of a befeathered
Chirnside circle. Some of the military escort
added their brilliant clothes to the tea
color scheme, and drank tea gratefully from
small cups under the corridor palms.
The first day of the V.R.C- Grand
National meeting drew the squattocracy in
motored flocks to the windy expanse of
Flemington. G.-G. Denman wore a new
grey suit which was creased to perfection.
The day was raw and rain-misty; but the
beautifully-tailored potentate disdained to
wrap up his exauisite garments in an over-
coat. Chamberlain Nevill, Secretary Guise
and Victor Hood escorted a couple of ladies.
The Clarke bride of yesteryear looked
plump in mole color, and paraded proudly
with her tall, pink-cheeked captain. Sister
Ivy Clarke, now busily preparing for mat-
rimony, tripped about in a little green vel-
vet frock and furs, and smiled underneath
a Russian turban. The married Harper
daughter wore vivid French mustard-color.
Dancer Volinin pranced about the lawn in
patent leathers and looked intolerably proud.
Miss Smoltz accompanied him. She was
wrapped in plush, but did not look as entic-
ing as she does on the stage in her
chiffon rig. Muriel Starr, of the Theatre
Royal, was in a reckless mood, and backed
half the horses on the course and some that
were only looking over the fence. Mrs.
Leslie Stuart, in lime green garb, gave a
tea party which was well attended by men.
Sister Mrs. Newbigin and Miss Hay, from
the Western District, were amongst the tea-
takers. Mrs. Geoffrey Syme, waving large
black plumes, had Miss Sproule under her
wins. The Miss is shortly to be married to
a Mr. Jones, after which she will depart to
England. Mrs. Albert Miller wore three
gigantic cream feathers. Colin McCullagh’s
only daughter was buried in a whole coat of
leopard skin and looked out triumphantly
from a civet cat collar. (It’s a swift animal
that can save its skin these days!) Mrs.
Wallach, in ermine, and Mrs. Murray Mor-
ton, in champagne color, were notice-
able in the parade. Mrs. Lee wore a car-
mine dress and talked gleefully of a £5O
win on the Hurdle Race. Leo Crane, a
St. Kilda youth and champion society
dancer, had drawn the second horse in Tat-
tersall’s, and his friends were buzzing like
bees. Reverential murmurs of “Two thou-
sand pounds!” were heard wherever he went.
Between races, the Best and Second-Best
People excitedly discussed the Melbourne
Club ball of the previous evening. Girls
were perfectly happy if they could
only sigh heavily and say they were “so
tired after that perfectly lovely dance!”
The tickets were hard to get, for members
had to pay two guinea* for each guest in-
vited.
The Melbourne Club gave a ball some 20
years ago, and the revel mussed up its com-
fortable quarters so much that it vowed to
exclude the hairpin sex for ever more. This
year, the bachelors of the solemn institution
—almost a new generation of bachelors —
gave the second dance of two decades. But
it did not happen in the Collins-street monas-
tery. It raged afar off in the St. Kilda
Town Hall, on Friday night. A whole maple
tree shot up from the centre of the ballroom
floor. The big tr’’ .< was surrounded by a
treeguard and a rustic seat; and the guarded
space was packed with cool, damp moss and
strewn with violets. The cool fragrance
drifted everywhere. Strings of tinted maple
leaves fluttered overhead amidst electrics, and
twined round the balconies. It was a rather
sedate, grown-up and chaperony affair for
a bachelors’ frivol, and the supper was well
suited to the careful, discriminating appe-
tite of middle age. Every diamond and al-
leged diamond that Society possesses blazed
on the powdered bosoms and shoulders of
the women, and many of the frocks were
built on daringly original lines. One woman
wore violet to the waist, and then endless
foamy frills above. Two Governors and
two staffs pranced majestically till the early
hours. The floor was so crowded that
dancers frequently had to leap to avoid the
short, swirling trains and tails that snaked
under their shoes. Only the Very Best were
present —the Pride of the Market, so to
speak. One handsome young matron carried
a precious sheaf of sweet-scented orchids,
and clung devotedly to them throughout the
revel. Her frock was a greeny-pinky con-
fection, made to match the hot-house blooms.
Three dinner parties at the Oriental preceded
the dance—a leisurely ten o’clock fixture;
consequently, the fortunate invited were able
to show their splendid rags before they took
them into the crush.
Skating was off at the South Yarra Rink,
on Wednesday of last week, when Mrs.
Burston, who is president of the united Vic-
torian hockey clubs, gave an auction bridge
party in aid of the hockey girls’ cash-box,
and sported a lovely grey frock alongside her
fellow-conspirator, Mrs. Watt. Mrs. Kimp-
ton, in chinchilla furs, carried off a silver
clock as a prize ; and Mrs. Aitkin, the smart-
est figure in blue you ever set eyes on, was
presented with a silver scent bottle. _ Mrs.
Major Mclnerney, of the pale gold hair, won
the guessing competition, and was rewarded
with a vanity box.
The engagement of the minute is that of
Captain Burnham, the G.-G.’s polo and golf
Help, to Maggie Niall. Margaret is a smart
Society girl, and an inveterate tripper of sev-
eral seasons, who feels quite at home on an
English mail steamer. She is the only
daughter of her widowed papa. The bride-
elect means to trip once again before her
marriage, and she is now located in an
Oriental Hotel suite, preparatory to steam-
ing off to Japan. Society dames, who know
all the social weather signals, have been
foretelling this event for weeks. Now they
are sitting back and remarking “Didn’t I
tell you so?” with oracular gusto.
On the night of the historic Supper Raid,
some cheerful young bloods who had just
escaped being caught at one caf6, strolled
round to one of the other places. A number
of police were lined up outside, and the hos-
pitable doors were shut tight. The lads
walked boldly up and knocked loudly. Pre-
sently the door was opened about half an
inch. “Can we get a drink?” cheerfully in-
quired one of the party. The horrified door-
keeper winced as if he had been touched
with a live wire. “No, no!” he moaned, and
slammed the door in the faces of the shame-
less revellers.
A beautiful youth who suffers from social
aspirations has been enduring the mental
tortures of the Lost ever since the Supper
Raid. The unhappy boy, instead of being
discovered amidst chamnagne and flowers
along with his social idols, was nailed at a
fried fish shop, or something similar- For
all social purposes, he might as well have
been found eating a saveloy on the kerb.
A small Society dame who made a fren-
zied attempt to escape from one of the raided
cafes, was respectfully caught by the Law
and carried back, kicking, to her supper
corner. She belongs to a large and wealthy
clan, and every member is now proclaiming,
at the top of his, or her, voice that the dear
girl “is so curious, and only went for the
first time in her life, vou know, just to see
what it was like.”
The one thing Society at large really
wants to know is: Who was found upstairs
when the Raid happened? The women who
were found gossiping over supper downstairs
seem to glory in describing the sensational
occurrences of the night. Muriel Starr was
at a table where many bon-bons had been
snapped, and the festive souls were wearing
the paper caps taken from the crackers’ in-
teriors. Muriel had the luck to find a police-
man’s paper helmet. “You can’t touch me—
I’m one of the force!” she laughed, as they
wrote down her name.
Society is now busy asking, “Were you in
the Raid?” Very few people are brave
enough to admit that they did not even have
a narrow escape. You see, the police visit
was a fort of social assay or audit, and
those who were caught will now be regarded
as life members of the Smart Set. There
is a dark rumor that the affair was origin-
ally planned for the first night of Gen6e, but
was postponed because —well, it would have
been rather awkward for everybody if an
Exalted Personage had been caught in the net.
On the selected night, Help Burnham was
being entertained by Mrs. George Chirnside,
and fiancee Maggie Niall was also of the
party. Another young man who was being
Jolly-Good-Fellow-ed before marriage was
officially asked for his name across the cham-
pagne.
The man whose congratulations fell sweet-
est on the ear of new County Court Judge
Winnecke made them without the help of
wig or gown. Barrister Morley went up to
Ballarat to make them, and lost all his
court millinery on the road. Morley had
helped Winnecke pay the rent of a room,
grandiloquently called “Chambers,” for years.
A Crown brief came Morley’s way. The
fee wasn’t tempting enough, so he passed : and
his room-mate, Winnecke, took it instead.
That was his start: the case was the Metro-
politan Gas inquiry. The new man has been
11 years at the Bar. For the first eight he
did very little, and added to law some coach-
ing in classics —you should hear his beauti-
ful Greek verse! Of late he has made much
more rapid progress, though there weren’t
many who thought he had progressed far
enough to qualify for a seat on even the
County Court bench.
The Repertory Theatre added a gloomy
Maeterlinck item to its banquet of Shaw
last Thursday. Though the Monday show
drew a State Governor, Thursday’s was
blessed by the presence of the G.-G. and
party. Chamberlain Nevill and the serious-
faced Secretary Guise backed up his Ex.,
while the rank and file of Society crowded
into the Athenaeum with the air of suffering
martyrs. They are convinced that it is the
thing to be intellectual; but you can see
quite plainly how it hurts by the way their
foreheads are creased. The knowing ones
study the plays and things up beforehand,
and go there with guffaws all ready directly
the “points” are made. Lesly Madded, with
a large, fair lady of impressive appearance,
occupied front seats. Dick Nevill acted as
escort and conducted them to his master’s
elbow. Then he sank into the chair next
to the fair lady, and Lesly talked away for
a busy quarter of an hour to the placidly
attentive G.-G.
The Repertory Theatre drew the line the
other night—or indicated where it had
been drawn—by a large, red placard attached
to the white wall. It read, “4/- Begins
Here.” The climbers who were located on
the wrong side of it looked either wistfully
cheap or cheaply defiant. State Governor
Fuller led a man party into the vice-regal
seats. Visiting Victor Hood, who was one
of the members, looked a very sick man. His
Ex. wore his moustache ends twirled up
and affected an unconquerable air of gaiety.
Help Curwen, nicely brushed and curled,
looked as demure as if he had never heard
of a caf6 raid. Harrison Moore, the slim,
boyish-looking professor, headed a numerous
stall party. Highbrows and Shaw worship-
pers glowed and gleamed on every side for
this, the second performance of “Fanny’s
First Play.” These shining intellects, by
the way, had mostly abstained from the first
performance because it was not to be vice-
regally attended.
Now that Phillips Fox has done his Mel-
bourne dash, his smart little wife is to have
her show of pictures. Mrs. Fox has booked
the Guildhall for a fortnight and a day, and
the “private” view, where everybody is pre-
sent, will be opened by Mrs. Kirkpatrick at
2.30 to-morrow (Friday).
Miss Reike Parker, a clever young Tas-
manian pianiste who is just reaching the
professional budding stage, is to be plat-
formed for criticism and admiration on July
23, in the Town Hall. The proceeds are to
be used to buy her some further musical
study. The Society phalanx at the back of
the alleged prodigy is led by the it Beckett
lady and Miss Michaelis. Two important
dames of the Miller clan are patting Reike
on the back, and selling tickets like profes-
sional agents. Mrs. Tute (whose husband is
an Indian Judge on sick leave, and who came
here armed with introductions from the gov-
erning Carmichaels) is helping all she can.
Carreno, it seems, pronounced the young girl
a fit subject for enthusiasm and encourage-
ment. Our own Scharf says that Miss
Parker not only has temperament and tech-
nique, but a physique equal to the continu-
ous strain of piano study. This is, in it-
self, a triumph for the musician, who was
injured in childhood, and has only recovered
her health after some years of invalidism.
She is one of three very musical, very pretty
sisters. Sister Kitty went to Europe to
study and remained to marry tenor Eisdale,
in London. Sister Norah, who is the pos-
sessor of a renowned dimple, is on the stage
in England. Mrs. William Nott has the
credit of teaching Reike, and Carrefio paid
her the compliment of saying that her pupil
had nothing to unlearn.
Gen6e is keen on motoring, and Chamber-
lain Nevill, of the G.-G.’s household, has
been _ piloting her round the country, and
showing her the winter wattles in bloom.
Gen6e, the fairy-like idol of thousands, has
been suffering from chilblains! After this
I am quite prepared to hear of angels out
of action through housemaid’s knee.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Governor took the chair—in the sense that he
sat on that symbolical piece of furniture—for the
annual meeting of the S.P.C.A. on Monday. The
venue was the Town Hall, and W. B. Carr of the
A.R.C., C. H. Goode, Bishop Wilson, A. J. Riley, of
the Pastoralists’ Association, Angus Parsons, M.P., and
Evan Kyffln Thomas, of the Register, were among
the vast crowd of humanitarians who took other
chairs. Both report and balance-sheet were satisfac-
tory. It was mentioned, amid loud cheers, that the
Society intends this year to wage war against the
traflic in worn-out horses, and to investigate various
rumors as to the cruelty to which sheep are sub-
jected during shearing.
The engagement is announced of Jean, younger
daughter of J. L. Stirling, of Strathalby, to Mr. T.
Procktor, of Glenelg.
Various feminine associations here have taken up
the question of prison reform. The other day they
attacked the Chief Secretary on the subject, in the
form of a deputation some 50 or 60 strong. One
of their special concerns was the type of lady
offender who, after about 200 convictions for the
same offence, is found by the baffled minions of law-
and-order to be still sinning as strenuously as ever.
Their idea is that there should be some sort of per-
manent Home for this deplorably persistent class of
law-fracturer —a place where alcohol is not, and
where the spoons, forks and other saleable ware are
always under lock and key. London once had a
female inebriate—named, with a certain absurd ap-
propriateness, Jane Cakebread—who “did time” on
480 separate occasions for the one error of being
beered and disorderly in a public thoroughfare.
“Why,” the Adelaide reformers ask, “should the
community be harassed with Cakebreads in this
fashion when it can stow them away in a comfortable
teetotal home?”
To turn to cheerier topics: Mrs. Charles Hayward
gave a smart dance in the North Adelaide Institute
on Friday. Decorations of pink and blue with
masses of roses gave the room an appearance that
all hands were acreed was absolutely French. It
is one of the most difficult things imaginable to
make a suburban Institute look really French. Mrs.
Hayward was in silver and blue with a lace-draped
bodice, and several other garments. Her daughter
wore green charmeuse. Mrs. J. Lea, Miss Louch (of
Albany), Miss Jean Wigg, Miss Von Doussa and Miss
Margaret Hughes were amongst those who looked
even more French than the mere mural decorations.
Mr. W. Pope, who is a lawyer between ten and four
or thereabouts, and a flower grower the rest of the
time, has been made president of the Horticultural
and Floricultural Society in succession to Mr, A.
Loutit.
Mrs. Charles T. Hargrave gave a tea on Tuesdaj
to Mrs. J. W. Campbell. The object of the meal
was to sustain Mrs. Campbell on her way to England.
The Jervois-Newland wedding, which took place
at Woodville on Wednesday, was gloomed (a new
word this, I fancy) by the sudden illness of the
bridegroom’s father. Most of the invitations were
cancelled; and the sort of wedding-guest who loves
to make long and asinine speeches, recounting how
he knew the family from infancy, and other pointless
literature of the sort, beat his breast in a good deal
of annoyance. Good enough for him. Miss Jervois,
who, on her mother’s side, is connected with the
McFarlane clan, is a popular girl. Her husband is
a nephew of Simpson Newland, and manager of the
Edward Hawkers’ station at East Bungaree.
There was a scene of revelry at Jackman’s Caf6 on
Thursday night. A mask and domino ball, of all
dissipations! Mrs. Stanley Murray, Mrs. J. Duncan-
Hughes, Mrs. Roy Burston, Mrs. Dudley Turner, and
Mrs. Gordon McFarlane were the hostesses. The
only. disadvantage about such a frivol, in a small and
gregarious community like this, is that the masks
disguise nobody, and the dominoes, except for mere
clothing purposes, are so many superfluities. As well
quest for Romance in a tin conventicle of the New
Jerusalem persuasion as in such an environment.
The Rowing Club ball, on Friday, was in the
North Adelaide Institute, which was a smother of
red, yellow and black—-the club’s colors. The Gov-
ernor and Lady Bosanquet were there—likewise their
daughter, one private secretary and two aides. Lady
Bosanquet wore cream brocade, with touches of pale
blue and drapings of lace. The Mayoress was in the
dress that she wore at her own ball.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE FEDERAL BANQUET.—MAKING
UP THE WINE LIST.
The Sydney Telegraph has already vaguely hinted
at a knowledge of certain dire plots for the embarrass-
ment and overthrow of the Cook Government.
Mr. Cook desired an adjournment of Parliament
sufficient to enable him to prepare a complete policy.
The Federal Butler: ‘'■For ' Raven’s sake,
leave me alone, woman! fve trouble ’ere
enough without being pestered by unpleasant
phantoms of your creation ! ”
“Hermes” writes: —
It looks as though the Defence Acts of both Aus-
tralia and Maoriland require enlargement so as to
deal drastically with the traitors and humbugs Who
inspire the youths to resist their compulsory train-
ing. In Maoriland some of the boys who were de-
tained for absenting themselves from drill started
hunger-striking. And the Peace Society backed
them up. If the Peace Society took to encouraging
burglary it would be dealt with promptly ; but when
its members conspire to leave the country open and
naked to foreign invasion, and so endanger the life
and property of every man and the honor of every
woman, no notice is taken. Every member of the
traitorous gang should be jugged. In Melbourne
they already have one dead body at their door.
Janies Parslow, a trainee, was discovered floating
dead near the Alfred Graving Dock, and at the in-
quest it was elicited that he met his fate while
attempting to escape from the ship. But for Peace
Societies and the like, the boy would probably have
been happy and contented, and proud of the fact that
he was qualifying himself to defend the lives and
honor of his mother and sisters in the day of inva-
sion. It is curious that these cranks can do with
impunity in time of peace what they would be sum-
marily shot for in time of war. Why?
TO SUIT THE TIMES.
Like one that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turned round walks on,
And turns no more his head,
Because he knows a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread.— Coleridge.
The Liberal selection for the Wollondilly
(N.S.W.) State contest wears something
the outward aspect of a joke. F. A. Badgery
was chosen to carry the banner because 33
people voted for him, and William McMillan
was chosen to occupy the back seat because
he only got 28 votes. Sixty-one votes in all
at the selection ballet. Yet at the last elec-
tion —not selection —the late member,
McCourt, had 3383 supporters. The small-
ness —not to say utter obscurity—of the
crowd which chooses the candidate is mar-
vellous.
Having considered the Australian situa-
tion, Bishop Mercer, President of the Peace
Society in Tasmania, has put in the corner-
peg and fixed his position. He recognises
that, though it is good to cry “Peace!” he
can have no assurance that the other party
will listen; wherefore “Australia had better
be prepared for anything that may come
along.” So he accepts the Australian sys-
tem of compulsory training, merely casting
at it the small pebble of reproach that it
begins on youngsters two years too soon.
“Tiaki”: “Rob” (B. 22 / 5/’l3) describes
the liquoring-up of no-license Invercargill
(M.L.) ; but the business of supplying the
goods isn’t half as simple as he puts it. This
section 38 of the Licensing Amendment Act
is the trouble: “It
shall not be lawful in
any no-license district
for any person what-
soever to lease, let,
hire, or permit or suf-
fer to be used any
building or place be-
longing to or occupied
by him or in his pos-
session or under his
control, or any part of
such building or place
for the purpose of
storing or keeping
therein or thereon
any liquor for or
by any other .per-
son.” Also the brewer
or publican must get
a carter to sign for
any beer, etc., shifted,
and the register is
open to J. Hop when
pursuing supposedly-
illicit liquor. The
“private” motor-car is
most used for the transfer of the goods,
though sometimes the common milk can and
cart answer the purpose.
When a deputation from Chelsea (Vic.)
waited on Premier John Weary, last week,
to protest against the licensing of a pub
in its district, one of the speakers intro-
duced himself as “a permanent resident of
Chelsea.” John reminded him that no man,
however staunch his teetotalism, can be a
permanent resident anywhere, until he gets
to Heaven. Life in Chelsea, probably,
changes so little that a local representative
gets to feel .eternal.
Practically the first administrative act of
the Joke Hook Government has been to take
the kangaroo and the map of the Common-
wealth off the Australian stamp, and replace
it with an undecipherable contraption depict-
ing King George I. in an unusually ordinary
mood, and looking even- more usual than he
usually does ; also the coats of arms of the
six States. Certainly, Frazer’s kangaroo was
not alarmingly beautiful or excessively nat-
ural ; but the stamp was at least an attempt
to be Australian. The new design, which
is nearly as crowded and miscellaneous as a
zoo, is in the main by Herman Altmann, of
St. Kilda. Now, supposing the next Labor
Government followed Wynne’s precedent,
ordered a new stamp, and selected a design
drawn by one of the new P.M.G.’s constitu-
ents, what would Liberalism have to say
about “patronage”?
Judging by the distressing frequency of
strikes at the Vic. State mine at
Wonthaggi—there have been about a
score in 12 months —it looks as if the public
was not getting a fair deal from
somebody. There are occa-
sional casual strikes at other
mines, but nothing like the num-
ber to Wonthaggi’s debit. Yet
the wages on the whole are
higher than elsewhere ; and the
men are practically the same.
They got their experience in
private mines in Australia ; they
are unionists, they are mostly
picked men, and not more than
two recent strikes have occurred
over a matter of wages. On
the latest difficulty cropping up
a deputation asked Acting Pre-
mier Weary to appoint an Ap-
peal Board to decide disputes.
But Weary refused. The man-
ager, he said, must be supreme.
No doubt the boss must be boss ; but if a
boss fails to adjust matters so as to keep
the machine working, it is time to try
another boss, or inquire why this boss has
so much trouble.

William McMillan did get into the N.S.W.
Assembly, how long would Wade’s leadership

THUMBS DOWN.
The story of a politician who has forgotten
how to swim.
The one member of the late Australian
Ministry who doesn’t seem to be wholly
regretted by his official subordinates is King
O’Malley. Labor Ministers, as a rule, have
been considerate and unassuming gentlemen,
devoid of feathers and frill, and careful not
to tread needlessly even on the office boy.
O’Malley was charged with being the excep-
tion. It is alleged against him that he was
fussy, interfering, cantankerous, a wonder-
ful deviser of new regulations, an amazing
stickler for having his full name and com-
plete dignity put on documents, a loafer in
business matters, and a person of red-hot
haste in matters of ceremonial. He was
accused of being more bumptious than a
brass god with a new suit of underclothing,
and more important than all his colleagues
put together. Still it isn’t alleged that the
staff had to rise up, and give three cheers,
and wave the ink-bottle twice round its
head when he entered the office, and that is
something to his credit.
A Victorian Farmers’ Convention met at
Bairnsdale last week. Haying had them-
selves addressed by sub-Excellency Fuller,
the delegates enthusiastically assimilated
speeches by those sturdy Anti-Socialists,
Cook, McColl, Bennetts and Kendell, M’s.P.,
and others of like habit of thought.
Then they gave the afternoon to
serious business, the same consisting
of four motions, all carried unanimously:—
(1) That the State should arrange country
passenger fares on the same scale per mile
as within the suburban radius; (2) that
the State should provide better accommoda-
tion in special trains running to agricultural
shows; (3) that the State should carry all
jute goods (bags and sacks) at the same
cheap rates as grain, chaff and potatoes;
(4) that the State should reduce the freight
on agricultural lime. Now, is the average
farmer just the ordinary sort of hypo-
crite, or doesn’t he really know what State
Socialism is V
A determined effort is to be made by the
N.S.W. Liberal party this year to recapture
the Newcastle seat, which was snapped up
in 1910 by Labor. The effort will be per-
sonified in Sparke, a local legal illuminant,
That is, it is expected to be Sparke, although,
as it was he who fired the suggestion which
has consumed such a considerable pile of
Liberal plunder by way of costs in the
Government House case, the enthusiasm for
more Sparke may become mere cinder,
MARINO THE CHOICE.
Liberals scorn the idea of Caucus methods; they
have a way of their own. —What we’re told.
Which reminds our artist that these are
stirring times for Liberals; considering the
result of the Wollondilly selection and the pros-
pect of similar diversion at Mosman (con-
sidered “ safe ” Liberal), where a small army
of party patriots have graciously offered their
services to the country.
From “Maskee,” just oft the bridge:—
“Briner” (B. 19/6/T3) expounds on Chief Light-
house Expert Brewis, and the £BOO a year offered
for running this show. No, some “captains and such
like” would not apply for. Brewis’s job, because cap-
tains, as a rule, know their job, and know also that
lighthouse engineering is not their job ; also, they
have sense enough, on reading the Brewis report on
the lighting of the coast of Australia, to know that
he knows his job. Further, they know £BOO a
year is mighty poor pay for the job and the qualifi-
cation and ability it is going to require. I suppose
the pay will rise as the work goes ahead ; but when
Miller was appointed to the Commonwealth Bank
they did not start him off at poor wages till they
had his fine new bank built. Uid they ? Captain
Glennie, mentioned in “Briner’s” par, had the same
chance as Brewis to apply, but perhaps, like others,
he would sooner stop at sea than come ashore for
£BOO a year and get mixed up with politicians and
heads of departments—that alone’s worth £BOO a
year. Brewis, I expect, is cursing that he ever left
the R.N. He came out of a North Sea Dreadnought,
and they don’t employ the slouchers there, as a rule;
so the chances are he was on a fair way to promo-
tion. The lighting of the coast of Australia, par-
ticularly the western and northern portion (the place
where the Japs and his Excellency Gilruth will get
mixed up first), badly needs someone who knows
how to light a coast; and I’m scared, now that they
have a report of what is wanted, that they will pitch-
fork someone of the usual Head of Department type
into Brewis’s place without Brewis’s brains to carry
the thing out. Then we shall be, as we have been
these last 17 years ; and I don't want those 17 years
over again, nor does any other man who has been
poking around these coasts that long.
THE NAILING UP PROCESS.
JOKOOK : “ Now, I wonder hew long that will
hold?"
A RIME OF VICTORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The temptation to rest after the recent arduous
campaign is no doubt great, but it must be resisted.
—Argcs exhortation to the Liberal forces.
The flag still .flies —it flies above our cohorts, as
before,
And we go marching on [hooray!] to fight and
bleed some more.
We’d like to camp and take our ease among corned
beef and beer ;
But, no! Up, at ’em [gasp], and smite the skulkers
in the rear !
The day is ours [oh, gosh!].... yet half the joy of
stoush is gone ;
The fact is—well, we've simply got to fight [more
gasps] , fight on !
The battle’s won [now, cheers!], and we might sit
back, if we chose,
And watch, among the slain, the swift, red beak-
work of the crows ;
The flag still floats above our ranks; the foe is on
the run,
And, for to-day at least, we’ve surely got the blight-
ers done!
We’ve licked ’em bad. See, on the far horizon
moves their flight;
But —oh, what weariness is war! They may come
back to-night!
With shield and buckler duly placed before our vital
parts
We’ve managed to protect from harm our stout,
unselfish hearts.
We wear the double-knitted socks the Women’s
Leaguers made
For us. Of what may chance we’re not—we never
were! —afraid.
For us there should be coffee, steaming hot, with
saveloys,
And well-earned rest and warmth; but —we 11....
what is that cursed noise?
The clangor of new conflicts sounds beyond us, and
behind,
And here and—-dash it! —there they go again, before
we’ve dined!
The victor’s spoils are ours, or should be, if we had
our rights,
But what is triumph if we know not victory's
delights ?
What though our foe is in the soup if soup our-
selves we lack?
Here, give the flag a flap or two, and cheer — they’re
coming back !
The flag still flies, and we must yet fight on [gulp],
give ’em rats,
And hand ’em all they’re looking for [pasp], jolt
’em in the slats,
And learn ’em that we [gurgle] still can keep their
hordes at bay,
And let ’em know who’s boss, in just the same old
sturdy way.
The flag still flutters [short, sharp pants] the same
old pole upon ;
Our hopes are high—but we must [gasp] still fight,
fight [grunt], fight on!
VICTORIA.

A KIAMA MOTHER.
REFUSED AN OPERATION FOR KID-
NEY TROUBLES, AND TRIED
DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT
PILLS INSTEAD, WITH SUR-
PRISING RESULTS.
Numerous mothers are suffering severely
owing to their kidneys being disordered, and
are unable to obtain relief. To such people
the following statement made by Mrs. Nel-
lie Iladdon, of Hospital-road, Kiama,
N.S.W., should be particularly interesting.
This lady was confined to her bed for three

(From a photo.)
months, and in spite
of skilled medical
attention could gain
no relief until a
friend recommended
her trying Dr. Mor-
se’s Indian Root
Pills, which she did
with surprising re-
sults, that are best
told in her own
words :
“They wanted me
to go to the hospital
for the removal of a
kidney;” says Mrs.
Ne 11 i e Haddon ;
“that was a doc-
tor’s recommenda-
tion ; but thanks to
Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, I de-
clined dong so, and
tried your remedy, after meeting so many
of my friends and relatives who formerly
persuaded me to do so. My agony for three
months in bed under medical supervision
was appalling, and I was then persuaded,
after waiting for recovery in vain, to try
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and noticed
an improvement in a few days, and con-
tinued on the mend, rising from the bed
two weeks later, a new woman. That was
two years ago. I have never been
ailing since, and I consider, by having
saved a painful surgical operation,
that I owe much to your great re-
medy. I am a mother of two children, and
2b years of age, now always capable of per-
forming my household duties, and our home
is never without Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
I ills. I have great pleasure in recommend-
mg them.”*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
All Sydney baseball roads led to Peter-
sham Oval on Saturday afternoon, where two pre-
miership fixtures attracted a multitude of roosters,
suffragettes and general barrackers. The standard of
play is sworn by the cognoscenti to have been worth
the trouble. In the first riot, Mosman-North Sydney
combination ran over Burwood by 15 runs to nine.
Then the combatants got off the face of the earth
to make way for blood-rousing “rounders” between
Leichhardt and Petersham, out of which Leichhardt
crept wearily with the score, six to five, in its favor.
The unbeaten Lane Cove brigade met a rabble from
Paddington and ate it up to the tune of 28 runs to
five —the season’s record banquet. Some of the fol-
lowers of the game who suffer from weak hearts
nearly came to an untimely end at the amazing sight
of University defeating Waverley by five to three.
Lane Cove’s lead looks good enough, but it is far
from secure, and there is a very hungry crowd of
wolves close on its trail waiting to take advantage
of the first fall of the Coves.
Australia took a mild interest in the
Henley Regatta this year because Cecil McVilly, the
Tasmania rower, was competing in the final of the
Diamond Sculls. The race took place last Saturday
afternoon, and McVilly beat someone named Pinks
by a length in smin. 29sec. The time is probably
wrong, as hitherto the record for the race was the
Bmin. lOsec. of F. S. Kelly, of the Leander Club, in
1905. On Monday the Sportsman gave McVilly
“beans,” and charged him with unfair tactics, get-
ting off his course and giving Pinks his wash. Which,
after all, is only what might be expected from the
Sportsman.
Sydney Lacrosse resumed its premiership
troubles on Saturday after the hold-up caused by
the raid in Queensland. Eastern Suburbs and Bur-
wood provided the star item of the afternoon, and
Burwood labored so hard that Eastern Suburbs was
glad to crawl but with the narrow margin of nine
goals to eight. It was a mighty close shave for the
top-doggers. The horror of the day was the down-
fall of Petersham, last year’s premier team, to Mos-
man, by five goals to one. In another quarter of the
infected area Birchgrove walloped Manly by six to
two; and Sydney helped University to maintain its
beaten record by scoring eight goals to its four. So
now the race for the top stands thus: Eastern
Suburbs, 17 competition points; Sydney, 15 ; Peter-
sham, 11 ; Burwood, 10 ; Birchgrove, nine. The rest
don’t count. Neither do some of the aforementioned.

“The Moke” wrestles with the weights
for Epsom, Metrop. and the two Gups in a spirit of
early anticipation: Nags from north of Sydney are
famed for being very dangerous when they “come to
town,” and a few of them have been given chances
in the A.J.C. Epsom mile on October 4. Among
them, Bullfighter (what a name!) at 7st. 111 b.,
Riverbird at 7st. 31b., and Sir Willie (Bst. 71b.) are
three good performers from Newcastle district which
have earned a bit more than they have eaten. River-
bird came down to Rosehill last Saturday, and ran
away with the lj-mile handicap, carrying Bst. 21b.
A mile is more like his distance. But Bullfighter
may be the best of the three in the Epsom. Ladies’
Man (Bst. 61b.) will be a five-year-old in the spring.
At three years he won A.J.C. Grantham Stakes and
V.R.C. Coburg Stakes, each one mile, and reads well
if wanted. He finished a close fourth in last Mel-
bourne Cup, and has now Bst. 41b. for the Metrop.,
Bst. 111 b. for Caulfield Cup, and Bst 61b. for Mel-
bourne Cup. In the same stable are Harpist, second
in A.J.C. Derby and winner, last April, of the A.J.C.
Plate, three miles ; and Cagou, second in last Syd-
ney Cup. Harpist has Bst. 51b. in the Metrop., and
Bst. 61b. in the Melbourne Cup, while Cagou will
romp under Bst in the Epsom, 7st. 111 b. in the
Metrop., Bst. 31b. in Caulfield Cup, and the same
in Melbourne Cup. The nick of the Eusom basket
iust now are Bullfighter. Riverbird, Ladies’ Man and
Tartanus, with 6st. 101 b. The last named, a son
of Tartan, won very easily over the Randwick mile
in January, carrying 7st. 71b. Likely ones in the
Metrop. are Allured (7st. 121 b.), Ladies’ Man and
Barrios (7st. 111 b.). Embracer (7st. 81b.), Perdita
(7st. 101 b.) and Abdieator (V.) at Bst. lib. Pun-
ters can lose money on these as easily as any others,
but they are the best on paper.
* * * *
On the first day of the V.R.C. Grand
National meeting the unexpected happened with its
usual assertiveness. There was a lot of dampness
about, and the opening event —-a maiden hurdle-
seemed to cut up the course so much that punters
mostly decided to leave the topweights alone. Con-
sequently, North Woodleigh, with list. 61b. up, went
out friendless for the Welter Race. Nobody expected
this slashing 4-vear-old could give 481 b. to, sav,
Pasio on a muddy course. But he did it easily
enough. Here was a tip for the public re Obi, the
top weight in the G. N. Hurdle, seeing that the
winner of three years ago, who had run third the
following year, and won some valuable flat races
since then, was in a class by himself apart from the
other 22 starters for the tussle now under d’scussion.
Punters, however, had made up their mind that
“every pound must tell” in the gruelling 3-miles
race. There was very little fancy for Obi, and
because he had not been freely backed in doubles
(like Wimmera) there was no “covering money” to
speak of, so the aristocrat of the party went out at
100 to 6.
The long race was run in a way that marked the
inferiority of at least a dozen of the 23 starters.
Wimmera, Hardrada and Bill Taft were lead’ng—one
or other of them —from the very start until the last
hurdle was jumped. Hardrada was the soonest
beaten, as the result of a slight mishap at one of
the jumps, probably. The impetuous Wimmera
seemed to tire under his list. 51b., but Bill Taft
remained in front. Of the others, only Wisconsin
and Bonnie George looked likely to win up to the
time when the leaders turned into the straight. But
in the run home Obi came with a rattle, and made
light of the common, or everyday, hurdlers.' He was
the thoroughly-trained racehorse beating them for
both speed and stamina. Even Bill Taft seemed to
be stopping whilst Obi was winning by eight lengths
or so. Wisconsin looked certain to finish in a place,
but the well-bred Forest Prince (lOst. 131 b.) pinned
him on the post for third money. Then it was
found that the time for the race had been llsec
slower than when Obi ran third, with list. 51b. up,
in 1911, and won, with 9st. 121 b. up, in 1910. He
was the same horse as in those years, but the field
was of inferior class. Last year, when Obi finished
out of a place, the time was 134 sec. better than this
time.
.Granting that he had only a poor lot to beat last
Saturday, the performances of Obi stamn him as the
most consistently good hurdler, bar Redleap of yore,
that Flemington has known. No other horse has
scored two wins and one third out of four successive
starts for a Grand National. He is by Coil from
Mousme, and is now in h.s seventh year. Bill Taft,
who was always in the first three from start to finish,
is by United States, and had his half-brother, Wis-
consin, travelled one yard faster, the imported sire
would have had both second and third placed horses
to his credit.
Of five names mentioned for the G.N. Steeple in
this paper a fortnight ago, Booligal has already been
scratched owing to an accident he met with on the
track, and Guncap, at latest dates, was coughing.
This leaves United Kingdom, Leah Kleshna and Cap-
tain Jingle. Add Bullawarra, Big Bob and Myall
Jack (who has only 9st. 71b. to hump), and the
winner is probably named. Acceptances are due to-
day (Thursday). There is a doubt about the jump-
ing powers of the brilliant Bullawarra, and Captain
Jingle, the Maorilander, has yet to prove himself in
“form.” The writer prefers Leah Kleshna and
United Kingdom to Big Bob, and picks United King-
dom—the runner-up last year —to win on Saturday.
League Rugby in Sydney on Saturday was
an extract from the Magniticac. The Huger of tne
Lord obtruded, and the proud were scattered in the
imagination of their hearts, the mighty put down
from their seat, and the humble and (not too) meek
exalted. Eastern Suburbs, the only unbeaten team,
came like a pampered lion to devour Newtown, and
—lo and behold! —it was overthrown by 14 points
to 11, in the face of 25,000 thunder-stricken on-
lookers. The mighty Messenger was there, and he
won the toss and took advantage of the breeze. But
the disadvantage only roused Newtown to more stren-
uous effort, and within five minutes a dazed crowd
looked at Newtown charging right through the cham-
pions, and saw a Newtown man fall across the line
and score. Then the welkin split. Messenger re-
sponded with a field goal. Newtown tried for a
penalty goal, and the ball, missing, fell in play. The
rushing Newtown vanguard leaped upon it, and
sweeping all before it, charged over the line and
scored, and when the points were added Newtown
led by eight to two. East Sydney got another goal,
a long and wonderful kick by Messenger, which struck
the post and lobbed over. The pace became terrific,
and the crowd rocked with excitement as the tide of
war went against the champion team. At half-time,
Newtown, in spite of the disadvantage of the wind,
was leading with 10 to eight. The second half was
great and husky. Newtown pressed the advantage
with quick, short-passing charges, and East Sydney
struggled frantically to even things up. Messenger
kicked as he never kicked before. Most of the time
he was off the ground and kicking with both feet.
Again Newtown scored a penalty goal, and Fortune
seemed to turn her back on the premier crowd.
East was compelled to force; but, shortly after-
wards, out of the scrum someone kicked clear, and
the Eastern winger, catching it, scored. Messenger
failed to add the points. With only one point to
go upon, the Newtown vanguard came again, and
East met it with a crash, and, for a moment, New-
town’s pack went to pieces. The back machine
stuck to its work, however, and brought all Eastern
attempts to nought. Then Newtown scored from
another free kick, and lifted the score to 14. The
breeze died away, and the chances of East rose in
the estimation of its barrackers. But Newtown re-
gained its combination, and pressed hard with a
series of splendid attacks, and when the whistle
sounded the champion team was glad to escape with
a defeat by only a margin of three.
OUT!

sends England's Jim Sullivan to dreamland in
Imin. josec. at Sydney Stadium.
The greatest surprise of all was the rout of Bal-
main by Annandale, after a start in which the pros-
pects of Annandale seemed worse than hopeless. At
half-time the scene had changed, and Annandale was
leading by eight points to four. The second half
saw Balmain put up a struggle. The game became
both fast and rough, but Annandale more than held
its own. It got Balmain down, and finally won by
16 points to seven. It was a great victory, and as
well deserved as it was unexpected. For the rest,
South Sydney made a shocking example of Western
Suburbs with 29 to five, and Glebe scrunched North
Sydney by 35 to 17. Eastern Suburbs still leads in
the competition by two points, having 14 to South
Sydney’s 12, Newtown’s 11 and Glebe’s 10. The
rest are single figures only.
* * * *
In the Union division Eastern Suburbs is
still unbeaten, having blighted Balmain by 28 to 11,
after a game in which the defeated side had never a
chance. Glebe journeyed out to Hurstville, where it
found St. George, and promptly fell upon it. How-
ever, St. George declined to be fallen upon, and it
wasn’t there when Glebe fell, and Glebe struck the
ground, and the ground was harder than Glebe. At
half-time the latter found itself nil to St. George’s
five. What the Glebe captain said during the interval
is not on record, but when he brought his lambs
back they played a very different game, and St.
George was hurled on to its line and kept on the
defensive, Glebe scoring intermittently, till it lifted
the figures to 16, when the whistle blew —16 to five.
So Glebe rose from the ground and became refreshed.
The previous week Manly made a draw with University
with eight points. This Saturday it did the deed again,
this time with Newtown by 11 points. South Sydney
got Western Suburbs in a bad place, and demolished
it by nine to nil in a game that was even enough
except in the actual scoring. So Eastern Suburbs
Club still leads the Competition with 18 points. The
nearest rival is Newtown with 13, University has 11,
and North Sydney, South Sydney and Glebe have
each 10. Below these are single figures.

The match between Maoriland and Sydney
Universities, at the Oval, on Saturday, sparkled occa-
sionally, and cheered up about 2000 spectators im-
mensely. The visitors looked much heavier and faster,
and seemed to show better combination, and yet,
somehow, when it was all over, the Sydneyside team
was only three behind—ll to 14. In fact, at half-
time Sydney led by 11 to eight. It was a game of
rapid scoring, and towards the end Maoriland came
with a splendid rush and lifted the score from
eight-11 to 11-all, and then, with an unconverted
try, won out with 14 to 11.
* * * *
The Sydney Soccer struggle for the
coveted Gardiner Cup raged furiously on Saturday, no
less than four matches being played off. Sydney
defeated Glebe by three goals to one in a game in
which the victor threw away about four goals by hor-
rible shooting. Newtown beat Merewether by two
goals to one, and that one Merewether managed to
snatch by a sudden dash just on time. Granville,
with its infection thick upon it, was too many for
Canterbury, which also went under by two to one.
Canterbury had a goal disallowed, and from the pen-
alty kick awarded instead, Granville scored. Which
is a solemn warning to all young plavers to observe
the rules. The match between the Navv and Balmain
was far from interesting—the Tattered Suburb
bumped the Sea-dogs by eight to nil. Only one match
was played in the Rawson Cup competition, Annan-
dale and Northern Suburbs making a draw of it with
two goals each.
League hoofball in Melbourne on Saturday
was practically confined to one match—South v.
Richmond—and the latter’s small ground was packed
in consequence. It was to all intents Richmond’s
last chance of reaching the finals, and a strenuous,
close game was anticipated ; but this writer has
never had the annoyance of standing out a more
untidy, sloppy, unskilful and generally uninterest-
ing episode. The 24,000 around the arena mostly
thought likewise, for even when Richmond got
within three points of South’s score, in the third
quarter, hardly a barracker cheered, while when
South at last settled down to business and drew
away, nary a “bloke” or “tart” from across the
Yarra yelled or screamed or even waved the red-
and-white colors usually flaunted when the “South-
ern Angles” are winning. It was a dour, sad after-
noon. South won by 59 points to 35 For the rest,
Carlton took a weak team to meet Melbourne, but
found that the old club had discarded some of its
acquired stars, and had put promising youngsters in
their places; consequence: Melbourne, 67 points;
Carlton, 54. ’Wood met the ’Dons and
walloped them by 72 to 54, and St. Kilda improved
its point-average by piling up 128 points to the
Students’ 56. ’Roy, intent on keeping its place at
the top of the tree, went down in force to Geelong,
but found that the Seasiders’ four consecutive thrash-
ings had done them good and improved their play
out of all knowledge. In the first term, they rattled
up 27 pomts to ’Roy’s six; at half-time the figures
were even worse —Geelong 57, ’Roy 14. The third
term was all ’Roy’s, 26 points being added to Gee-
long’s nil; but in the last the Sleepy Hollow men
woke up again and finished with 78 points to ’Roy’s
67. This defeat puts ’Roy in third place.
In the Victorian Ass. the vimful struggle between
the six leading teams to squeeze into four
places continues, and each week sees changes
in position. P’ran, now fifth, was on top four
weeks back; then ’Scray, then North; now ’Scray
is there again. Brunswick was sixth a while back,
now it is third; and all the while Williamstown
hangs in the offing, so to speak, and does its darned-
est to out its weekly opponents, just for the joy of
the thing. On Saturday it met North and kicked
10 goals seven behinds to death, while North was
scoring eight goals 18 behinds, and so bested it by
one point. P’ran and ’Don, scuffling for fourth place,
indulged in an exciting skirm'sh, which the latter
won by straighter kicking-—nine goals 10 behinds to
P’ran’s eight goals 15 behinds—the same old point
of difference. ’Scray smothered ’Cote by 88 to 37 ;
Port thrashed Brighton by 70 to 59, and ’Wick fell
on the disgruntled Cit : zens like a kilnful of its own
bricks —112 points to 39.
A cable from ’Frisco (U.S.A.) announces
that Duke Kahanamoku, of Hawaii, broke two world
records on Saturday afternoon by swimming 100yds.
in 54 3-ssec., and 75vds. in 39 4-ssec. This is
staggering news.

The Bathurst-Sydney road cycle race, dead
some years now, will probably be revived, owing to
the obliteration of the Gou lbu rn - Sydney rush. In its
day it was a great fixture, and provided a lot of ex-
citement, and in importance it ranked next to the
Goulburn-S.vdney affair, which, however, always held
pride of place, owing to the fact that it was the
fixture in which the Ma State reps, for the Warrnam-
bool discovered themselves. Now the Goulburn has
gone, the revival of the Bathurst would be a decidedly
good move, and as the time is ripe and a number
of substantial donations have been promised, it is
more than likely the resurrection will take place.
The League of Wheelmen is also in the
field with another new road race, from Tamworth to
Newcastle, a distance of 174 miles. The Dunlop
Rubber Co. has donated £25 for a first reward, and
other parties are following the lead. If a good prize
list can be made up the bikists. in the Peel River
district will have a fine race of their very own. It is
good to see that sport is getting decentralised, if
nothing else is.
* * * *
On Saturday night something between
9000 and 10,000 people swarmed into the Rush-
cutters Bay Stadium, Sydney, to see a great and
glorious fight between Sullivan, ex-middleweight
champion of England, and Pat Bradley, a young man
from Ireland, via U S.A. For a long while Bradley
had been despised and rejected among stoushers. But
when he entered the ring on Saturday night he was
admittedly the most dangerous fighter in Sydney.
Nevertheless it was generally believed that in attack-
ing Sullivan he had bitten off more than he could
comfortably masticate. Still a mighty upheaval was
regarded as certain, and Bradley, when he did go
down, was expected to do so fighting like 10 devils in
a struggle with many tiger cats. The time arr : ved,
but there was no appearance of the fighters. Pre-
sently an ahnouncement was made that the car
which was to convey Sullivan from his training
quarters at Hunter’s Hill had broken down. The
superstitious immediately deduced an evil omen.
When Sullivan did arrive, he was startled to hear a
most furious hooting; and thought it was a demon-
stration against him for keeping the. crowd wait-
ing. As a matter of fact, it was a few thousand
hoodlums howling at referee Scott because he had
given an unpopular decision the previous week. So
when Sullivan climbed into the ring he was worried
and unnerved, and being of a self-conscious tempera-
ment it meant a good deal to him. Then there was
some little delay, and the longer he waited, the
worse Sullivan got. Bradley, on the other hand,
was self-possessed and laughed at everything and
smiled at everybody. Bradlev advanced to the fray
with his chin buried in his chest and covered by his
glove. All the rest of him Sullivan was free to hit.
For with the one vulnerable point covered, Bradley
regards himself as impervious to the slogging of
anybody; while if there is anybody impervious to
his slogging, his address at the present time is not
Sydney. Patrick Bradley does not try to box. He
scorns to make points. He takes punishment galore,
and as long as he can come up w'th unimpaired
strength after each bout, he can afford to, for he has
to land home only, once, and the rest is sleep. He
bored right into Sullivan’s defence the moment the
gong went, and got bashed greatly about the head
as he did so. They were hard blows, but he still
bored in to get his range. Sullivan backed away
from this crouching, impervious mass, into Bradley’s
corner, and as Bradley followed Sullivan smote and
smote him hard in the body. Out flashed Bradley’s
left, and landed, apparently, on Sullivan’s temple,
and as he reeled there came a half-right jolt to the
chin. Sullivan fell against the ropes, and, half-
turning, he dropped head first to the floor, and re-
ceived a bad bump. He could probably hear the
far-off counting as he rolled under the ropes, and,
seizing them, he tried to haul himself up. But he
was done, and it was minutes after his staggered
seconds got him to his corner before he could stand.
Had he been kicked by a bullock he could not have
been in a worse condition. The fight lasted 90sec.
Before the huge crowd could get properly to its
feet a white-coated bearer of good tidings scrambled
into the ring and in a voice of thunder begged gen-
tlemen to keep their seats. The gentlemen, and the
others who had hooted so loudly, sat down together,
and it was announced that Jimmy Hill and Harry
Thomas would box 10 three-minute rounds, no deci-
sion. And when they were through, Messrs. Shields
and Dibley would do likewise. A crash of applause!
Hill entered the ring in Bradley’s trunks —six sizes
too large and hanging on him like petticoats—and
without foot covering. He had no shoes, and could
not get a pair to fit him. Three of his rounds he
fought bare-footed, with his petticoats floating in the
wind. It was a good fight, and after Hill’s shoes
came to hand it was better. Thomas had the ad-
vantage of weight and strength, but Hill had the
agility, and made full use of it. The margin of
points was certainly on his side. As they faded
out a dark young man, tall, lithe, with a perfect
skin, a classic nose and eagle, almost sinister, eye
climbed into seat, while into Bradley’s
corner struggled a young old man, minus many teeth,
with holes in his sox, and a bored expression. He
bleated plaintively to somebody about something, and
a varlet appeared running with shoes, wh ch were
hastily put on. The tall dark young man asked
questions of others, which were inaudible. The
voice of the announcer indicated the tall dark man
as Mr. Dibley, the weary-looking old young man as
Mr. Shields. ” They both spoke to the referee, but
their remarks were cut short by the clanging of the
gong; and then —wough, smash, crash, biff! They
fell on each other like avalanches, but the dark ava-
lanche was terrific, and Shields, full of grit and splen-
did determination, was momentarily overwhelmed. It
was not scientific, but it was the most willing scrap
ever seen in the Stadium. In seven minutes Shields
was cut down the cheek, his nose was bleeding, he
was bashed and battered, and men waited breathlessly
for a knock-out. But he was full of sand. He
smiled through the wreckage, and fought like a lion
to get a chance with a deadlv uppercut. Sometimes
it missed, sometimes it was blocked, and sometimes
Dibley wasn’t there. Sometimes Dibley sent him
reeling before he could let it loose. But still Shields
fought on, and still Dibley smashed. In the eighth,
Mr. Baker called a halt. It was the first time
Dibley, who used to fight at the Gaiety, had been
seen in the Stadium, and if he always fights as vim-
fully as he did on Saturday night, it is to be hoped
he is seen there again.
Adelaide City Council has decided to make
a comparatively heavy levy on the hundreds of ath-
letic clubs that have pitches or lawns reserved for
them on the park lands. The right, granted hitherto
for a nominal five-bob fee, has now been assessed
at £1 for football, croquet, hockey or cricket, and
£5 for golf, which wants a lot of room.

A New Lease of Health.
“ The wonders brought about by this
preparation are no less manifold than
amazing.”
So writes a well-known physician in
the Medical Press and Circular one
of sixteen thousand doctors who have
testified to the value of Sanatogen in
various kinds of weakness, loss of nerve-
power, impaired digestion, brain-fag,
sleeplessness, and general weakness.
Sanatogen, the tonic food with lasting
effects, has given a new lease of health
to more than a million sufferers, in-
cluding many of the most distinguished
people in the land.
Nerve Power Restored.
The reason for Sanatogen’s great
efficacy in nervous disorders has been
pointed out by no less an authority than
Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8., M.D.,
Public Analyst of Dublin, who states:
“Sanatogen is an excellent nerve food,
containing a large amount of organic
phosphorus in exactly the form in which
it can be easily absorbed.”
But Sanatogen does more than revivify
the nervous, system. It also builds up
the muscular tissues and has a beneficial
effect upon every organ of the body.

The Old Soldier: An ancient (which
ancient is the writer), suffering from the last
possible devil of a neuralgia, took a fancy
(it was the only thing he could take with-
out being arrested on a charge of shop-lift-
ing) 1 the other day (it was the only other
thing he had about him save his small
change and a cigar) to try the out-
patients’ department of Sydney Hospital
(in his days of active service he assisted
at variops trials, and sometimes the de-
fendant .Was shot, but this was the first time
he trie ( d a hospital). The gate-keeper told
him to arrive at noon if he Wanted to see
Paracelsus, or Luke the Physician, or any
other medical or amputating
authority. He arrived, and aft.er waiting
25 minutes in a cold, damp cellar of a place
amid the pretentious buildings which house
the hospital, he was given a red card, the
color of a Turkish outrage, and told to come
back at 1.30. By the time he got clear of
the premises or temple he found it was 1.15,
and there was no time to get a sausage, pie,
pig’s foot, sheep’s trotter, calf’s brain, savr
cloy, blood pudding, cow’s heel, or other
hurried lunch, while an ordinary meal
was impossible. So he dried his feathers in a
gleam of sun, and gave three cheers for the
Weather Bureau, which was then doing
about its worst; and waited till the half-
hour arrived on tardy feet, like the extremi-
ties of that Jewish king who was decayed
in his understandings. Then he presented
himself to someone who was dressed in a
little brief authority and other clothes, and
by this person he was directed to another
portal. It is said that the future is only
the past entered by a different door, and
this was just the same old cellar approached
by a different entrance. Later this scribe
was given his “book,” which he didn’t want,
because he pays up regularly to a library, in
which are all the great works of Marie
Corelli and the masterpieces of Archibald
Clavering Gunther and Charles Garbage. And
lie was told to take a certain door on the
left. He didn’t want to take anything that
didn’t belong to him, but for the first time
in his life he gave way to dishonesty. He
found some more cellar, and some more
crowds of patients, and some more forms.
All the space that wasn’t filled with form
was occupied by ceremony. Angels in nurses’
uniforms flitted in and out through the door
which communicated with the surgery, and
their wings sometimes got jammed in the
doorway. The writer picked up two or three
feathers. Inside that door the sound of
heavenly harps was mixed with the smell of
medicine or something. Probably it was
something. Maybe it was chloroform.
The sun was setting. A rooster was
crowing in the distance. A policeman
was going past on feet that weighed 141 b.
each. The forms were still full of patients.
Time rolled on, like an immense football on
a down-grade, or a dead whale’s heart falling
overboard from a whaler. The damp smell
continued and multiplied like a green bay fig-
tree. There was no sign of Galen. Hippocrates
didn’t profess to turn up. But a rumor
that he might be around about 6 p.m. per-
vaded the premises. So the Old Soldier
took his neuralgia in both hands and left.
And he now endeavors, in a moment of fury;
to make his lost tram-fare by writing this
paragraph.
“10-2-4,” on a point of Etiquette, or some-
thing : Loyalty—or should one rather say,
Tummas ’Enleyism?—is a splendid thing;
but, on occasion, thoughtless. Thus the Syd-
ney Telegraph, in 'its report of the move-
ment which is in progress to appeal to ■ the
Privy Council over the Eviction matter,
printed this: —
A Lithgow solicitor wrote: “I am directed by a
loyal Irish lady to send you a cheque for £1 Is. to-
wards the cost of appealing to the Privy Council in
this nefarious matter. My client is denying herself
the luxury of a new bonnet, and will probably, if
necessary, dispose of her entire wardrobe to dis-
appoint the disloyal brigands.”
An entirely naked Irish lady, however loyal,
would be regarded with a lack lustre eye by
the Lithgow authorities, assuming she took
to the public streets. In fact, they certainly
would run her in—reckless of the conse-
quences to the Empire—and charge her with
some such banal offence as unclothed be-
havior or disorderly conduct in the alto-
gether. This is no weather, anyhow, for
nude Irish ladies, more especially in and
around Lithgow, which, as the writer has
cause to remember, can be infernally chilly
during the month of July. So one may take
it that the gentle patriot from over-
seas, when her entire wardrobe has been
disposed of; when the last fragment of under-
clothing fias been consigned to the treasurers
of the fund, will stay at home. But in this
case her life will be intolerably lonely. We
live in a conventional age, when people, even
if they do not actually shun naked ladies
from Ireland, are not in the habit of going
out of their way to call on them. For one
thing it is embarrassing; for another it leads
to gossip. Once Lithgow’s female loyalist is
completely undressed she will not be able to
consult even with her solicitor —unless he is
ushered to her presence in blinders, or un-
less the conference is carried on by telephone
or through a keyhole. Above everything,
when, as a result of the jettisoning of every
stitch of her clothing at the bleakest time
of the year, the case against the N. S. Wales
Government has been, mayhap, won, she will
not be able to witness the disappointment
of the brigands. The besottedly unimagina-
tive Sydney police, unable to grasp fully the
association between loyalty and a state of
complete nature, will, like their Lithgow
colleagues, be bound to make trouble. Tak-
ing one thing with another, this Hibernian
loyalist will be well advised to retain one
or two garments —say, a flannel nightgown
and a pair of slippers ; or a fur coat and a set
of warm bloomers —no matter how despe-
rate the need appears. As to the solicitor,
it is questionable whether the Incer-
porated Law Institute won’t have a stern
rebuke to level at him later if he
aids and abets his immigrant client in the
fantastic course that she meditates. I ask
in all seriousness if a solicitor who acts for
wholly undressed clients shouldn’t even be
struck off the roll'/ It seems to me that it
is much the same as being an undressed
solicitor, and what barrister worthy of the
name could consent to be briefed by a soli-
citor who was thus exposed to the four
winds of Heaven?
The various Sydney ferry companies have
been called upon to provide a lifebelt for
each passenger, and, of course, the usual
deputation came along from the companies
to the Superintendent of Navigation and
asked for exemption. The Superintendent
refused. The arguments of the deputation
were humorous and displayed an impudence
that was appalling. Its great point was
that the lifebelts would cause a panih, and
passengers would be injured in the rush to
get them. They were also unnecessary, as
the steamers were already well equipped
with life-saving apparatus and were
built on the bulk-head principle^—like the
Titanic. But it isn’t a collision between
ferry boats that will supply the grand catas-
trophe; it is the running down of a crowded
theatre-boat by a 4000-ton tramp or 10,000-
ton liner. No bulkhead system could save
a ferry caught amidships by one of the
floating monsters. The life-saving apparatus
with which the steamers are already “well
equipped” seems to consist solely of seats
that will float. Float they will if they can
be wrenched loose from the deck and got
out of the closed-in part of the steamer;
but it would take a screw-jack to get some
of them loose, and there are no big sliding
doors through which the passengers could
jump with their seats from the sinking boat.
Most of the people on the glassed-in upper
decks would be drowned like rats in a cage.
From the way the deputation spoke, the
companies evidently intend to store the life-
belts in one particular part of the steamers.
If so they will be useless, as it would be
impossible for the limited crew to serve them
out fast enough. And if a big steamer struck
ihe ferry boat just where the lifebelts were
then they would be there no longer. The
belts should be arranged along the backs of
the seats, and fastened so that a man will
not require a pair of wire cutters and a
jimmy to get his only hope out of its fixings.
To stick them in some particular part would
mean a stampede, in which the back markers
would walk over the heads of the front
rankers in their haste and terror.
The keynote of success at artistic crimi-
nality is audacity tempered with foresight.
The Law lives largelv on bluff and a reputa-
tion for getting even in the long run, except
in Victoria, where it has given up even that
pretence. Truly in most other places it
does occasionally get even in the long run,
but through the miscreant’s own bungling
and tendency to put frills on his crimes.
Strange how these people get the. limelight.
When a pair of Sydney suburban girls were
recently attacked in a lonely house and
viciously battered and robbed, the press de-
scribed the job as a “Daring Outrage.”
There was nothing daring about it. An
armed man attacked two defenceless girls
and naturally got away, and a great city
swallowed him up. The safest place to stab
your enemy is in the midst of a great crowd
where everybody is packed close together.
“Jack the Ripper” kept up his ghastly jokes
on fallen women for months in about the
most crowded quarter on earth. The gentle-
man who repaid attentions to his admira-
tion-hungry wife with a dose of cyanide
always administered it in the most
crowded part of Berlin. He would grip his
victim from the back, and when the other
turned round and opened liis mouth to ex-
postulate he got the poison in the
opening. It was the murderer who held the
poor gentleman up and cried loudly for help.
It was only when he had held up about the
seventh or so that the Law remarked
if he held up any more it would begin to
suspect him. The really daring criminal is
one who robs or slays in a lonely country
district whei'e every stranger is an object
of suspicion and everyone can rely upon his
whereabouts being known. Any fool can,
provided he has impudence or audacity
enough, kill one or two people with safety
in a crowded city. Which reminds the
writer that he has some creditors.
“J.”; If there is a more undisciplined
public in the world than that of Sydney I
don’t wish to meet it. It never keeps to
the right when walking the streets; when
two or three meet and discuss the question
of where they will irrigate they always
stand right in the middle of the ridiculously
narrow pavement while they argue. Women
who meet other women hurrying to the bar-
gain sale stand all over the pavement and
talk shrilly, bobbing and jerking about in
a most dangerous fashion (the City Coun-
cil’s by-law re hatpin guards is still widely
disregarded). And besides, some of them
have elbow-points like sword fish. But it
is in travelling that the foolishness of Syd-
ney crowds stands revealed in all its hid-
eousness. When the ferry boat is about
50yds. from the wharf the cheerful lunatic
climbs on to the rail, hangs on bv the floor
of the top deck, and waits to jump imme-
diately the boat comes within what he con-
siders his range. Next thing is an avalanche
of .meat and uncle and cricketer and clerk
and old grandparent soaring through the
air and hitting the pontoon hard. Some-
times there is a loud splash and a yell of
terror, but not nearly as often as one would
wish. When the early jumper has reached
the pontoon he does not rush to catch the
train or tram that is connecting with the
boat. He waits for his pal that didn’t
jump, or stops to discuss the chances of
the well-known pony Fall Down at next
Wednesday’s meeting. He is always about
the last man to leave the pontoon, and he
jumps wildly on to the moving train or
pace-gathering tram to the risk of his own
life and the laceration of other people’s
nerves. There is excuse, or a shadow of
excuse • for genuine haste —on second
thoughts there isn’t. It is absurd to take a
risk to save 35sec. and go into the hospital
for six months or. the cemetery for eternity.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O playmate whom I understood, come back to me

I dare not face the pain
That dims the ardor in your eyes because I whisper
“Wait!”
I tremble at your touch; as man, you ask too much ;
I needed but the boy in you—come back to me, play-
mate !
No strong sob ever shook your throat, nor made me
feel afraid,
When I, a little maid,
Took shelter in your comradeship, yet felt that I
was free;
Why need that feeling change to something fierce
and strange?
I would not be a woman yet—-playmate, come back

I\>ssicker: We are intei’ested in your
fiscal theories, and hope, in response to your invita-
tion, to send a man out to interview you. Have
carefully noted that he is to make for Mount Mar-
garet (W.A.), and get from there to Lyon’s Well,
and then ask for "the Bloke in the Tin Hut.” If
the editor can possibly get away he will come in
person. All through a long and ill-spent life his
great ambition has been to get to Lyon’s Well, be-
yond Mount Margaret (W.A.). If he has the luck
to get there he will bring some cigars... .Crux: A
little grain in a bag of chaff. Winnow it.... Doub-
tful: Yes, it’s a run... .Jaybell: Thanks; but Temple
Clark’s proposal to sool 1000 Chinese on to Queens-
land's prickly pear has had one clod thrown at it,
and it isn’t worth another... .W.H.M.: (1) Not
available. (2) In Great Britain approximately
448,000 farms are rented; total area, 28,300,000
acres. Don’t know what the landlords get; but the
land bought by county councils under the Small
Holdings Act, 1908, is leased for an average of about
245. per acre. That, however, would probably be a
good deal above the average for the 28,300,000 acres.
(3) Two-thirds of M.L. lands are held under lease
direct from the State. There are over a score of
lease tenures... .D’Harville: Sorry neither of any
value....A. Stewart: That crow-trapping recipe has
been published too often to have any freshness left.
Kipling related the tale... .G.F.A.: Two of
the most pointless yarns in our wide experience. ...
Hilda N. : Idea is graceful, but you have versified it
laboriously. Not sufficient skill yet. One instance:
The second line in the second verse ends with the
phrase “do so”—and “do” carries all the weight.
Yet the rhyme is “glow.” Then, as the last verse
is arranged, “our” is almost essential. But notice
how much easier the line flows without it... . Gee
Gee (Ararat, Vic.): Thanks for cutting. Always
interesting to know who is pirating. By the way,
the “lifted” story was not the work of the writer
you name, and he read your remarks with perfect
calm.... Bellerive: An instructive city sidelight:—
AUCTION ROOM SCENE’S.
An old moth eaten coat and vest
A tie and a masher’s collar
Was put up by an auctioneer
And sold for half a Dollar
Bids were made for anxious lots
By dealers in left off clothes
The careful and the eager sports
The auctioneer artfully knows
An accordion with broken key’s
Was knocked down for five and six
Worth about seven and sixpence new
And would cost the same price to fix
Theres careful bids and random bids
By dealers in auction room’s
For bundles of clothes pots and pans
Shovels and old yard Broom’s.
....Winihi: Give it another couple of years
Coree: Seems to be an idea lurking behind a patchy
curtain of words.... Forewoman: Story starts off
like a flight of skyrockets and bursts before the
reader has thrown his head back to 100 k... .Good-
year: Send full address to Accountant, this office....
S. : The sketch is no use whatever, and the
verses are a poor imitation of “You Are Old, Father
William.” No use trying to paint the lily if you
have only got a small supply of tar.... J.W.C.: No
use for Harold. .. .W.J.H. (M.L.) : Yarn left at the
post....L.C. (W.A.): Mildly humorous. Hardly
worth while. . . .H. 0.: You caught nothing with your
lines. .. .M.M.: Another master mariner is captain
of that craft... .Concertina: A weary jingle
Nip: Get out of the way! A.L.8.: No print
value.... Cle: Basket Wunsaweek: Just a wild
poet’s first squeak D.8.G.: Dull rhymes......
Ernest C.: If you wrote less like a broken-legged
spider escaping from an inkpot, or got some friend
to transcribe your scrawls we wotild respect you
more. A difficult fist is a big handicap to a new
writer. The busy reader can’t stop to decipher dread-
ful scratches, unless he has a good idea the matter
is worth while... .W.E. (Fingal) : No, thanks....
Erip: Sorry, not good enough.... Nemo: “Life” says
nothing new R.N.C.: No ginger Jimmo
(S.A.) : It is worth nothing. That amount has been
forwarded to y0u.... Wandau: Laborious gaiety.....
J. Rudd: Unsuitable... .Dinny: Verses basketed....
J. Quill: Sweet and feeble.... Henry: Misses the
political ’bus by days. .. . J.L.8.: Some thunder in
it, but it is below print level. .. .Next, Please: Glad
to get your assurance that the Rev. Father Robinson’s
father was a Dublin solicitor, Orangeman and Mason.
Any other assurances that the Rev. Father Robinson’s
father was a Welsh Lutheran, a French Baptist, and
a Scotch Levite must be taken as read. ... W. L.
Blossom: Of local interest 0n1y... .E.L.E.: Divorce
poem failed to tickle us... .S.R.G.: Plenty of vigor,
anyhow. It yo-hoed, and charged, and swashbuckled
into the basket in the most dashing fashion imagin-
able. .. .H.H. (St. Kilda, V.) : Almost scored. Try
again, and work in as many descriptive touches as
possible. .. .Phil R.: Unsuitable... .A.L.B. : Sorry
not up.... Nix: A rather dull story. .. .K.H. (Q.) :
Graceful work, but below print level. Try again....
T. : Some humor, but parodies are out of our
line. .. . Paroa: Fairly well done, but not suitable for
B H.T.: Sketch is very slight, and you haven’t
worked it up well. Idea is all right. .. .L.F.8.:
Like a brief extract from a jeweller’s catalogue....
Bellerive: Herewith—‘Part IT. Improvement on
early efforts written at Odd times when wandering
the seacoasts and outback localities of vie.’
THE WHIPSTICK SCRUB—BENDIGO.
Horrid grinning skulls and skeleton bones
Have been found in the shadowy whipstick Lones
The gruesome remains of rough diggers bold
Who had perished in the scrub whilst seeking for gold
venemous snakes are aroused from their sheltered Lair
By the sound of a human footstep there
A weird scene is the dense scrub by night
When stillness reign and the moon shines bright.
... .Reynard: Frankly the “pome” isn’t worth while;
but the cheery little footnote makes excellent reading.
Consider it: “Meditated while cutting bracken ferns
in South Gippsland. The writer has yet—it appears
—a million or so acres to cut, but does not propose
meditating proportionately.” Pity is that if you
made a conscious effort to convey the weariness of
interminable fern-cutting, you would probably put
on the literary brake and fail. But in that footnote
you really do straighten your back and put life into the
wilderness.. .G.L. (V.): If we expressed our opinion
of your “Lament” in a public place, and within ear-
shot of a policeman, it would cost us at least 40s.
next morning. .. .H.C.G.: Have read better Tottie
.poems. Tottie has had a lot of verse written about
her, and is, in a literary sense, very well wrapped
up....H.0.: You don’t show any signs of heco-’'"' T >g
the representative bard of golf. It seems too delib-
erate a game to be written up in hurrying verses.
Why not try a sonnet to the Niblick, or the Caddie,
or one of the strange appliances?. .. .Arthur P.
(M.L.): Sorry “Winner” unsuitable... .Yilimbo:
Good point, but you come to it by a rough road....
J.A.T.: Refuse to get excited, or to believe that
“danger is wafting on the breeze”... .E.G.: Cer-
tainly not! Angel J.: “Pro” is rather weak.
Other may pass, if the verse carpenter can make a
job of it....lkona: Fearfully lofty tone about it.
Suspect that you wrote it while standing on top of a
ladder... .F.T.C.: Nothing of any print value in the
batch... .Jans T.: The wild, unreasoning barracker
has been well focussed, and is worth preserving. If
the prose plumber can separate him from the rest
of the sketch, his roars will probably be heard in
print.... Mug Bill: Haven’t time to advance “solid,
logical, convincing argument” as to why you should
join the Rural Workers’ Union, Bill. This is our
hurry-up day. But, consider the lawyers’ union,
doctors’ union, farmers’ union, fish merchants’ union,
coal mine proprietors’ union, landlords’ union and a
few more, and you may see the point. Again, you
may not, Perhaps points are not your strong
point. ,


What Those Who Know Say of the
BEALE HIGH-GRADE PIANOS.
Ihe majority of our Pianos are sold on the personal recommendation of users, and we are
constantly receiving letters from our customers praising the BEALE High-grade PIANOS. Our
instruments are in use m every part of Australia ; in New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia,
Mauritius, oll t 1 rica, India, and on the continent of Europe; and everywhere they give the
same unbounded satisfaction.
Below we give a few (greatly condensed) extracts from unsolicited testimonials from buyers of
Beale High-grade Pianos.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
Mr. F. OWEN, jun., Hon. Sec. School of Arts,
Tuena: —
“Piano has given every satisfaction. People com-
petent to judge say it is the best instrument in the
district.”
Mrs. J. A. SWAIN, Kilphysic, Caroll:—
“Has tood the changeable seasons remarkably well.
We are ail very pleased with it.”
Mr. G. JONES, Canterbury:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction. No hesitation
in recommending the Beale to anyone as the finest
piano procurable.”
Mr. E. E. VIDLER, Morisset: —
“Piano is in perfect order, notwithstanding the
fact that it has been in constant use.”
Mrs. ELLEN KILLEEN, Wolfram Street, Broken
Hill: —
“Has given every satisfaction. Tone is rich and
full: instrument has stood the Broken Hill climate
wonderfully; better than any other piano that I know
of. Would recommend the Beale Piano to anyone who
wants a real good piano.”
Mrs. JOAN MASSIE, 44 Hunter Street, Newcastle: —
“The tone exceeds my expectations, being wonder-
fully mellow, while the external finish is very hand-
some. Several professionals have expressed their ad-
miration.”
Mrs. C. JENNINGS, Blende Street, Broken Hill:—
“Better to-day than when it was supplied to me
five years ago, and we have had some very severe
weather since then. The tone improves with use.
Can recommend the Beale Piano to anyone requir-
ing a first-class piano for tone, touch and dura-
bility.”
Mrs. F. RUDDOCK, Waimea, Walgett Street, Ka-
tooinba:—
“Highly delighted with it.”
Mr. J. SLATER, Killarney, East Moree:—
“Wish to express my fullest satisfaction in every
j way with the instrument.”
Mr. J. HOGG, Lithgow:—
“Piano has given perfect satisfaction.”
Mr. CHARLES R. RAYNER, Sec. Oddfellows’ Lodge,
Casino:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction.”
Mr. A. GREEN, Burwood Street Junction, New-
castle
“The time that it will remain in tune is wonder-
ful. I have had English and foreign pianos, but they
never remained in tune a quarter ot the time, nor
came near the Beale for tone.”
Mrs. W. O’HARA, Wyalong:—
“More than pleased with my piano. Everyone who
has heard it admires its beautiful tone.”
Miss A. M. RUDDER, Kempsey:—
“Have no hesitation in saying that it would be
impossible to get a more satisfactory instrument
from every standpoint. Its tone is to-day as soft
and brilliant, and its appearance as handsome as
| the day it was bought.”
Mrs. C. C. GRAHAM, Temoin Street, Trangie:—
“Very pleased with Beale Piano. Always ready
to recommend your pianos to anyone requiring a
first-class instrument.”
Mrs. P. POWER, Rose Mount, Forest Hill, Wagga:—
“May mention that I am very pleased with the
piano you sent me. Tone is very rich.”
Mrs. H. B. WALLACE, Glenroy, Bertram Street,
Mortlake:—
“Piano is a ‘gem.’ Has given every satisfaction.”
QUEENSLAND.
Mrs. M. McKINNON, 357 Bolsover Street, Rock-
hampton :
“Piano is perfect. A friend of mine who was
prejudiced against the Beale Piano, decided to get
one when she heard mine.”
Mr. A. R. ROBINSON, Sec. People’s Progressive
League, Adelaide Street, Brisbane:—
“Piano is giving great satisfaction. Many have
expressed their surprise at such a high-grade instru-
ment being manufactured in Australia.
Mrs. M. WARD, Mount Perry, via Bundaberg:—
“We are all very well satisfied with the piano.
Tone is excellent.”
VICTORIA.
Mr. J. H. BAYNE, Carnarvon Street, Auburn: —

I think so highly of them. Mine has given nothing
but satisfaction.”
Miss L. LOVERING, State School, Kerang:—
“Thoroughly satisfied with the instrument.”
Mr. J. H. ROGERS, Woolocot Street, Coburg:—
“Must say that everyone who has been to my
place has nothing but praise for the piano.”
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Mr. H. J. ARMITAGE, Public School, Houghton:—
“Piano, which I have had for three years, has been
in constant use, and tone is as good as when I got
it. Pianists often remark on its great purity of
tone.”
Mrs. H. WALKER, Wandilo, Mount Gambier:—
“Must express my satisfaction with your beauti-
ful, sweet-toned instrument.”
Mrs. C. EVERETT, Renmark:—
“Much appreciated by all who play it.”
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Mr. G. A. BEECK, Katanning:—
“Self and family are more than pleased with the
Beale High-grade Piano.”
Mr. J. A. MILLS, York:—
“Quite satisfied with piano in every way.”
Mrs. C. POWELL, Linden Villa, Stirling Street.
Perth:—
“There is not a better instrument in Perth.”
Mr. T. WARD, Wagin, Western Australia:—
“Greatly satisfied in every respect.”
Mr. W. H. BROWN, Kalgoorlie:—
“Very pleased with the instrument. Much better
than I expected.”
TASMANIA.
Mr. W. K. DRAKE, Westburg:—
“Piano has given entire satisfaction. Have had
it two years, and it has not yet needed tuning.”
Mr. HENRY NEWTON, Launceston:—
“As good as the day I bought it. Can safely re-
commend to anyone. Good pianists have pronounced
it to be a first-class instrument. Touch and tone
are perfect.”
The above are just a few of the many testimonials that we are continually receiving
from users of Beale High-Grade Pianos. .
Such success has only been obtained through our unwearying efforts to produce an
instrument of the best quality. That we have succeeded is proved by the opinions of
those who should know best —the users of our pianos. ,
To obtain this quality we have invented patent methods of construction which render
our pianos more durable, while retaining and enhancing all the musical qualities of the
great makes of the Old World. The use of an iron wrest-plank—which is part of our
patent steel as great an improvement in the art of piano manufacture
as was the superseding of the old wooden-frame by the iron-frame which is used in all
modern pianos! In addition, we have introduced many other improvements such as our
method of building up the casework from cross-plies of wood which is all thoroughly
seasoned here, and hence fit to withstand Australian climatic conditions “ uch b e tt e r than
timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate of Europe In order to get the best of skilled
artisans, we pay higher wages than those awarded by the g
trades. We naturally get the best artisans, and thus the best of skill. We use only the
finest of materials.
We realise that an Australian-made piano is subjected to much closer scrutiny in
Australia than any imported piano, and therefore we make —we are compelled to make—
our pianos much better than those of our competitors. But then, by making pianos in
Australia we are in a position to make them much better suited to Australian conditions.
Any competent cabinet-maker will tell you that timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate
of Europe cannot be expected to withstand Australian conditions of dry heat as well as
timber which is seasoned in this climate. This is a most important point in piano-
making, and is one good reason why so many foreign pianos develop cracked sounding-
boards, split tuning-systems and faulty casework soon after arrival in this country. But
no man can say, that he ever saw a Beale piano with a cracked sounding-board. We
absolutely guarantee that the sounding-boards of the Beale Pianos will never crack in any
climate, because our special system of construction renders cracking an impossibility, at
the same time that it greatly enhances the tonal qualities of the instrument. Beale
pianos contain the only practical steel tuning-system in the world —so there can be no
question of splitting of the wrest-plank. And then our patented system of cross-plied
woodwork ensures permanence of the outside case of the pianos.
Be sure of this: the better musician you are, the more you will delight in a Beale High-grade Piano.
We have always on hand a number of good second-hand pianos, taken in part payment of
Beale Pianos.
Call and inspect the Beale Pianos now. Inspection does not put you under any obligation
whatever. You suit yourself entirely as to whether you purchase.
If you cannot call, write for Catalogue, which we will be glad to send post free. We sell for
cash or on easiest terms. ===========

What a difference stropping makes!
Only those who have used an Auto Strop in comparison
with a non-stropping safety can tell just how much difference
there is—not only in the smooth, close shave which the
sharp stropped blade of an Auto Strop ensures, but in the
simplicity of its use also.
It takes far less time to strop an Auto Strop blade (and so keep it in the pink of condition)
than to put a new blade into a non-stropping safety razor. The Auto Strop is the only razor
that strops itself and consequently

BIG BEN
a
L 6 9,
Don’t set your mind—set Big Ben
Don’t bother your head about get-
ting up. Leave it to Big Ben.
You ought to go to sleep at night
with a clear brain —untroubled and
free from getting-up worries. You
men, if you are up-to-date workers,
work with your brains as well as with
your hands. Such a little thing as
“deciding to get up at a certain time
in the morning” and keeping it on
your mind often spoils a needed night’s
rest and makes a bftl “next day.”
Try Big Ben everywhere in the house
for a week. He makes getting up so
easy that the whole day is better.
Big Ben is not the usual alarm.
He’s a timekeeper 5 a good, all pur-
12/6
Postage lj- extra
pose clock for every day and all day
use and for years of service.
He stands seven inches tall. He
wears a coat of triple-nickel plated
steel. He rings with one long loud
ring for 5 minutes straight , or for 10
minutes at intervals of 30 seconds
unless you shut him off.
His big, bold figures and hands are
easy to read in the dim morning light,
his large strong keys are easy to wind.
His price, 12/6, is easy to pay, because
his advantages are so easy to see. See
them at your storekeeper.
If you cannot find Big: Ben in your town, send a
money order to the makers’ Australian office,
IVestclox, 63 Pitt Street , Sydney. They will
have one mailed to you by the nearest jeweller.

THE AMBEROLA AND
Blue Amberol Records.
Here is an ideal entertaining combination: —
The Amberola is the superior of all sound-reproducing instruments.
The Blue Amberol Record is Mr. Edison’s latest phonographic in-
vention. Played on any Edison machine it makes an instant appeal
—on the Amberola it scores an emphatic triumph. The lack of
buzzing and rasping, and the fine, steady pitch, greater in volume
than ordinary Edison Records, make it especially attractive to music
lovers.
The Blue Amberol is practically unbreakable, wear-proof, and has
been played over 3800 times without any deterioration of its won-
derful tone qualities. It is more lifelike in repro-
duction than any other Record —clear and sweet
in tone, resonant to the lower notes and delicate
and steady to the highest soprano voices.
The wide scope of selection in the first issue of
Blue Amberol Records fills every desire of phono-
graph lovers, whatever their tastes may be. We
have issued a handsome catalogue of Blue Amberol
Records, and you are requested to send your name
and address to-day for a free copy.

Not Without”: The recent slaying of
one lunatic by another at Yarra Bend
(Vic.) with a pick handle this time —re-
calls the unpleasant fact that several sim-
ilar assassinations have happened at that
institution. A few years ago, no less than
three unfortunate cranks were done to death
by brother inmates within a few weeks. The
star performer strolled into breakfast one
morning from one of the “cottages” with a
self-satisfied grin, and cheerfully informed
the attendants that a little ambition he had
cherished _ for some time had been realised —
he had killed Christ. The principal exhibit
in the case was a billet of firewood, with
abundant evidence adhering to it. The fool
Law, to appease itself, had to saddle the
fool country with the expense of an orthodox
criminal trial, and consigned an already
duly branded and bottled lunatic to the
Criininal Ward at Ararat, where (if he
isn’t dead) he still enjoys the benefits of
the “Governor’s pleasure.” In another case
a large redgum quoit block was wielded
with artistic effect, the peg making a good
handle. The flimsy chain that had anchored
it to a post for “safety” snapped like a
thread when tested, by an infuriated mad-
man on business bent. Still the only won-
der to me is that tragedies are not more
numerous. The medical officers, for one
thing, are too ready to allow dangerous
lunatics to join the work-gangs, with mur-
derous weapons in their hands, the extra
rations and other perks being a great in-
centive towards applying for toil of this
kind, which, by the way, can be made to be
very nominal toil in the hands of a cunning
and be-devilled artist. Sometimes, again,
“work” is tried by way of experiment with
howling maniacs, or even for the sake of
getting an extra troublesome cuss out of
the way of the medico when doing his
rounds. I guess if the medical experimen-
talist had to accompany his spade or axe-
armed protdge on the job, there would be a
lot more discrimination displayed in this
respect.
“Bloggs” on a Current Unpleasantness:—
For the past week or so a number of Bondi
(N.8.W.) residents have been trying to get an hotel
licensed in their suburb; while another section has
been battling like a herd of demons to defeat- the
scheme. Nearly all the evidence for what one may
call the defence has related to smells. “.Outfalls” ;
the “flow” of the local sewer; the effects of ven-
tilating shafts on the ambient ether; the influence
of the weather on the odors of the neighborhood ; the
insupportable stench of portions of the beach in
summer as compared with the unbearable effluvia of
the same in winter —these and a hundred other
highly-spiced items of the sort have engaged the
attention of the Court for days. As a result of a
study of the proceedings at the Licensing Court last
week a feeling of profound relief has come over me
that I do not live at Bondi. It has been mentioned
variously that the sea at Bondi is discolored, at in-
tervals, by the sewer; that the sand on the eastern
end of the beach is polluted regularly, and the sand
elsewhere occasionally; that fish which are cleaned
in Bondi water are unfit for human consumption;
that when certain winds are blowing the entire sub-
urb has to either hold its nose or flee in the direc-
tion of Parramatta; that persons uninured to life
at Bondi are kept awake at nights by the piercing
character of the local smells; that invalids have
come to Bondi to recuperate and been struck dead
by the smells on issuing forth for their first morning
stroll; that certain breeds of dogs refuse to stay in
Bondi while the hardier and less saleable sorts re-
main ’nnly after bitter protest. _ Naples, seemingly,
is a mere circumstance to Bondi; and the cities of
the Levant so many violets by comparison with it.
According to a local tradition the originator of the
Petriana myth bought himself a pleasaunce at Bondi,
thinking that here he would be in his element, but
was driven presently to sell it at a loss and settle
in Woolloomooloo. The case for the objectors to a
new hotel in this pestiferous spot is, briefly, that
thTedifice would be a white elephant and a superflu-
ity since no one would stay there whose sense of
nose was not atrophied ; and that, of these, the ma-
jority would be bound to die either from lying on
the beach, or breathing the air or surfing in the
noisomelv discolored water, or eating one of the pes-
tilential'fish which abound in the vicinity of the
“outfall ” As one result of the spirited efforts of
th- no-licensers this unhappy region has acquired
reputation for insanitariness that amounts, I should
a reputation mi . g im robable that any other
niarp in the world’s historv has had the ex-
their acquaintance.

IN
BANANA LAND
The Government raises a breath of wind
these days by the sale of town lots along
the routes of promised railway lines. Juan-
dah, between Miles and Taroom, was the
scene of the last outbreak, and the prices
soared, as usual, on the wings of expecta-
tion. The district has some interest, mostly
grim. Through it Leichhardt passed on the
way to Port Essington ; and a tree with an
L carved in its ribs is left in the main
street of Taroom for the local generations
to talk about to the scarce visitor. And on
Juandah Lagoon “Fraser’s vengeance” was
worked. Most people know the story of the
murder.ed family and the subsequent wiping-
out of the qiggers, with the connivance of
the Government. Juandah itself in the old
days a cattle station which bred some of
the most ‘■daring horsemen that ever sat on
the roof of a horse.
Digby Denham’s unwise Government of-
fered the Commonwealth some advice in the
Governor’s speech about purging the Federal
electoral rolls. It now turns out that its
own jury lists contain 11 per cent, of dead
men.
Bob Philp is nowadays a very mute figure
on the Government cross-benches in Banana-
land Assembly. One would not think it was
the same man who eight years ago acted the
Jack-in-the-box part as leader of the shat-
tered Opposition when Arthur Morgan piloted
the Coalition. Last week, however, he rose
and gave the Denhamites some good advice
about the danger and folly of excessive bor-
rowing. As a teacher of thrift, the political
spendthrift of olden days seemed like a
dream.
Dr. Ham, who has just resigned from the
Victorian service, was for some years
Health Commissioner in Queensland, and
was about as peppery and impulsive as they
make ’em. In Queensland his specialty was
rat-extermination, and so thoroughly did he
operate in Brisbane that people at last
fancied they had no right to kill off their
own vermin without the doctor’s sanction.
He himself used to tell a story of an old
lady who wrote to him in these words :
“Dear Doctor Ham. We got a rat at our
place. Please send up two men.”
DEALER (to new parson): “Quiet! O' course he’s
quiet! He's just the little ’orse to suit yer.
Why" (in a burst of confidence) "you can leave
that 'orse standin' outside the pub all day and he won’t shift a leg."
“Kobbi”: Further proof of the ruined
sugar industry which has been so much
trumpeted abroad: —
A number of trucks are being built in anticipa :
tion of a record sugar-cane season.
Would to Allah some one would ruin me in
the same way! I have never had a record
season in my life.
Died, the other day, in a Charters Towers’
hospital, Jacob Wirth. He had battled
along for 50 vears as fossicker, miner, se-
lector and townsman, and had taken no
great harm. On coming into a substantial
share of the famous Wirth millions, how-
ever, he decided that his case demanded
hospital treatment. Some men are never
satisfied.
Denham’s great railway policy, which was
to open up the back yard of Queensland has
definitely failed to materialise. The Govern-
ment borrowed all the cash Cohen would
lend on anything within cooee of the old
terms, and work was started in a dozen
centres. The cash has now gone and build-
ing operations have almost ceased. The
coastal line that was to have connected
Rockhampton with the northern ports has
pushed its nose a score of miles from the
town, but cannot be encouraged to go a
mule’s kick further; and the big western
line that was to “link up” all the western
termini has died of starvation and frost-bite.
The House of Adipose.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Three fresh appointments have just been made to
the Queensland House of Adipose.—B. 26/6/’l3.
When manly muscle waxes stiff, and manly
vigor fails,
When manly brain is occupied in wond’ring
what it ails ;
When, ’stead of walking head erect, you lean
upon a stick,
And ponder how the mischief ’tis your back
is all a-rick ;
When always, quite unconsciously, you prate
of olden ways,
And babble, half defiantly: “Ah, them —them
was the days!”
When all the poetry of Life is soured to
dullest prose,
It’s time you got promoted to the House of
Adipose ;
When Life is sere,
And things are queer
And gout is in your toes,
It’s time you pressed a cushion in the House
of Adipose.
Whene’er you feel the masses are becoming
coarse and rude,
And say ’tis time the classes should take up
an attitude,
So that the herd beneath ’em should keep
meekly in their place,
And show themselves repentant for their
fall away from grace ;
When golden chains that stretch a foot across
a waistcoat white,
And hats of glossy cylinder are lovely in your
sight;
When ev’ry dinner’s incomplete without an
after-dose,
The signs are full you’re ripe and fit to join
the Adipose ;
When what you’re worth
Is in your girth.
And ruddy beams your nose,
It’s time you took to babbling in the House
of Adipose.
When innovation seems a crime, and changes
make you mad,
For fear the folk may yet attack the privi-
leges you’ve had ;
When ev’ry time you’re forced to think “I’ve
had my little day,”
You wonder how the world will wag when
you’re removed away,
And how the Constitution that was leaning
on yourself
Will ever keep its boiler full when you’re
upon the shelf;
When ev’ry path’s beset with thorns that
never bear a rose.
And grunt and growl and chronic scowl be-
tray the Adipose,
When only pricks
And grievous kicks,
And rude and vulgar blows
Can drive your carcase into line, you rank
as Adipose.
When Action seems a deadly sin, and Pro-
gress but a bore,
When half your time is snuffle-full, and
t’other half a snore,
The day has come to take your place among
the Portly Great,
And roll your bulk across the path to block
the car of State;
For, though there be ten thousand ways of
forging on ahead,
There’s but one way of holding back and one
of being dead ;
And holding back and feeling dead and
wheezing out your woes,
Are tokens of your ripeness for the Cave of
Adipose ;
When ev’ry day
A fresh decay
Your faculties disclose,
It’s time you took v o ur ticket for the Cave
of Adipose!
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 5, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Health Department opened a public
vaccination depot to-day, and among the
reluctant ones who filed in, in order to get
home, was ex-Premier Verran, of South Aus-
tralia, who has been up here on the Abo-
rigines Conference. All the nurses at the
hospitals have also to be scratched, and
herds of the general public have stampeded
to sample the brand of small-pox microbes
kept in stock by the Department.
Mrs. Leonard Turner, one of our pretti-
est matrons, who lives mostly in England,
is just now staying with daughter Joan,
whose husband is a something ornamental
and useful at the British Legation at Mos-
cow. His name is Bruce Lockhart, and I
hear that he is very good-looking.
Mrs. Lewis, who has been a shining light
in the Q.W.E.L., was tea-ed and farewelled
on TuesdaV afternoon by the Windsor
branch, of which she has been president
since it was born. As a shining light, the
brooch set with Queensland gems, that
Macrossan, M.L.A., pushed into her hand
from her friends is a mere reflection of her
popularity.
On Thursday afternoon Josephine Lewis
entertained several of her pals at Eschen-
hagen’s. She will be missed, too, and the
good wishes of her musical friends will add
quite a lot to the weight of her luggage. On
the same day the Women’s Club (which
lives in the Q.W.E.L. rooms) gathered itself
together and did some more farewelling.
Both Mrs. and Miss Lewis figured in a pre-
sentation from the Central Council of the
Q.W.E.L. Mother collected a good Aus-
tralian travelling rug, a pair of straps and
a leather cushion, and daughter was solaced
with a cushion. The crowd’s share was
coffee and sandwiches. The departing ones
will leave by mail train for Sydney to-mor-
row (after being vaccinated), thence to Eng-
land by White Star boat. Lewis pere, who
has a large paw on the Telegraph news-
paper, goes with them as far as Melbourne.
The visiting representatives of the Eng-
lish Suffragettes talked at the Q.W.E.L.
rooms on Monday afternoon, and again at
the National Council of Women yesterday.
The second discourse was prefaced by kindly
Mrs. _ Kingsbury, who, while carefully ex-
plaining that she did not herself sympathise
with the noisy section, urged consideration
of fair argument. The consideration was
politely extended.
A golfing man is telling the following lie.
He says that a scion of English nobility
went forth _to play on the Yerongpilly
links, and his partner, though a very nice
girl, was no professional at the game. Four
balls found their way into the creek, and no
amount of coaxing could get them out. The
scion said in a sweet. English voice, “Would
you mind going wight away ovah the hill.
I must take my clothes off and bwing out
those balls. They cost two shillings each,
you know.” The damsel retreated, and was
joined a little later by an urbane Britisher
with the missing goods. Saving a few
splashes of mud in the vicinity of his ears
he appeared quite in his usual health.
Ililma Oilman is to be married early in
August to Harry Mills, son of a man who
writes his name on English banknotes.
Mills, jun., resides at Warra, where lie has
a station. Pretty Ivo Brenan, too, is to be
wed to one Mustard, who is a planter or
something over in the Malay States. This
event is to happen somewhere about the
same time as the other event. Ella
Christmas is going to put her tuneful violin
in its case and also begin housekeeping.
* 10 P S the week were the
Hello girls annual twirl, the gyrations' of
tii6 Maoii Club and tlio toG-yxcrcisG of tho
Blue Birds and Arcadians. The South
Brisbane Sailing Club is doing something i n
the saraband line at the Gymnasium Hall
this week.
The Queensland Ladies’ Kennel Club tried
to hold its annual meeting on Monday night,
but there weren’t enough members t'6 form
a quorum. So it was just going home in
disgust when it remembered that a kind
soul had promised to recite to it about an
hour later. With a howl of dismay it raced
back to await the coming elocutionist.
“Rosna’s” line from London: —
Australians to give another bride to the tottering
British peerage. Jos£' Metcalfe, the pretty daughter
of the Metcalfes, one time of Bananaland, is to marry
John Evans-Freke, tenth Baron Carbery. The bene-
dict is 21, and owns Castle Freke, at Clonakilty, in
Cork, Ireland. The first peer of the tribe started
baroning in 1715, so they haven’t hung on to the
dignity for many years apiece—-less than 20 years
apiece, in fact. The family was originally Evans,
but according to the record, when “the direct line

How much the direct line failed for is not recorded,
but it is sincerely hoped that it paid something in
the £, and got its, certificate.

AUTRALLA JANE.
Some fierce epidemic, apparently akin to
influenza, has decimated the rabbits of Wes-
tern Queensland, and huge districts, once
heavily infested, now can’t show a single
bunny. If the prickly pear could only be
inoculated with measles or whooping cough!
Since “Myola” was turned down as an un-
suitable name for the Federal capital, Bris-
bane suburbanites have adopted it as a label
for their residences. One is glad, of course,
to See a change from “Alicia,” Maudville”
and “Ethelberta,” but the painful fact re-
mains that Myola signifies in the Herbert
district the place where the aboriginals
slaughtered married women who had proved
unfaithful to their husbands. Perhaps Mr.
Suburbia intends it as a warning.
It was singularly fitting that the new
hospital or institute for the study and treat-
ment of Tropical Diseases, at Townsville,
should have been opened by Governor
Macgregor, for his Ex. is a medical man with
a larger experience of tropical diseases than
any other doctor in Australasia. Nearly 20
years ago, when very little was known of
the subject, Macgregor was writing from
Lagos about certain experiments he and
his friends were trying in the way of cir-
cumventing malaria by excluding the mos-
quito from all dwellings ; and, as subsequent
events have proved, he was on the track that
led to the very heart of the whole trouble.
“Bill the Goose” is puzzled :
. Distances, as everybody knows, play strange tricks
up North and out West. It will be 15 miles to a
place when you start, and after going five miles
you’ll meet a man who’ll tell ybu you’ve' only got
20 more to do. It’s the same on the railways. For
instance, if you’re going from Doolbi to Childers,
on the Maryborough-Cordalba line, it’s a mile, and
the fare (Ist class) .is 2d. ; but if you’re coming
back over the same rails from Childers to Doolbi it’s
two miles, and the fare is 4d. Also, if you’re »
Childers corpse and want to go to Doolbi you’ve got
to pay Is., while if you’re a Doolbi corpse and want
to go to Childers it’s only 6d. It’s time the Doolbi
corpses did something about it. Anybody is - liable
to be a corpse at Doolbi and want to go to Childers.
The Queensland sugar-miller is putting
his molasses, to a more respectable use than
he did a while ago. Hundreds of thousands
of gallons are still utterly wasted, and other
hundreds of thousands of gallons are merely
used as fuel for the engines. Nevertheless,
of last season’s outnut 1,957.000 gallons
were sent away, mostly to distillers ; 768,000
gallons were traced as fed to stock: and
1,662,000 gallons were saved up in the tanks,
and a low grade of sugar will be made from
most of it this year. In the old kanaka
days the industry fell into the sloppy, un-
tidy habits that prevail in nearly every
place where the cheap nigger is relied oil
to do the work. The arrival of the white
man has meant more brains and less of the
awful waste that was at the bottom of most
of the failures there ever were in the
business.

Our experiment of a couple of years
ago, of taking the wholesale catalogues
of the Great English Manufacturers of
Electro Silver and Solid Silver Goods, and
deducting 2Q.%, or. 4/- in the £,
from their prices, was of a revolutionary
character, and might have landed us in
heavy loss, but
IT DID NOT,
owing to our great output, and so we are
continuing the discount. It only gives
us a bare commission on many lines, but
commissions count, if numerous enough.

“New Rival”
Shotgun Cartridges
There is economy in making cartridges out of paper, but
paper cartridges are liable to be affected by so many condi-
tions that great care should be taken in their selection. You
are perfectly safe in buying Winchester “New Rival” shot-
gun cartridges, as these cartridges are made according to
correct principles. The paper is manufactured specially and
made into cartridges by automatic machinery, which insures
correct size and compression. They are then waterproofed
by a process which absolutely excludes moisture of whatever
nature. The loading is all done by automatic machinery,
infinitely more certain than human hands, and only standard
brands of powder, shot and wadding are us*ed. The primer
is sure and quick, and that corrugation around the head —a
patented feature allows for expansion and prevents the head
from pulling off. New Rival” shotgun cartridges are
made in various gauges suitable for all kinds of shotguns
and are blue in color. They are made strong to permit reloading.

Red and Itchy, Could Not Sleep,
Cuticura Ointment Had Wonderful
Effect, No Return of Symptoms,
Eton St., Hampstead, Ashburton, N. Z.
—“When my baby was about six weeks old
her head all came out in a rash. It was
the same two or three mornings and then
her cheeks and eyebrows got red and itchy
and she could not sleep. Her cheeks were
cracked looking and were bright red in the
morning and dry scales came over her head
at the top and on her eyebrows. I was
told it would go away after teething. I
tried ointment but it did no good.
“I had seen the Cuticura Remedies ad-
vertised frequently and resolved to try them.
I got a sample tin of the Cuticura Ointment
and used it as directed. It had a wonder-
ful effect and did a lot of good from the
very first. I have put it on her face and
the red inflammation has gone out of it in
two hours.
“I cannot say exactly how long the
eczema lasted but I used the sample tin and
a little more out of another I bought and
baby has had no return of the symptoms
and is now ten months old.” (Signed)
Mrs. Letitia Clemens, April, 1912.

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results.
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR SPECIALISTS.
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Halr-Orowlng Compound
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

“0.C.C.”: Cheering intelligence arrives for the meat-
consumers of the Ma State, and incidentally of the
whole Commonwealth. N.S.W. Statistician 'frivett
has issued a return showing the live-stock of the
State in 1912. There is a serious decrease in every
case, thus: —
Milch-cows (the goddesses) are 17,780 fewer.
Dry cows (strict teetotallers) are 17,674 fewer.
Springing heifers (giddy wretches) are 6884 fewer.
All other, including calves, are 28,748 fewer.
Sheep over one year old are 1,743,119 fewer.
Sheep under one year old are 3,768,050 fewer.
Pigs (otherwise hogs or swine) are 77,514 fewer.
And so on. Even the goat, the hardy tin-chewer
and poster-devourer, has gone back The aristocratic
Angora has diminished by 1853, while the common
or garden rock-haunters and “slop”-butters have
lost 3594 long-bearded companions. About the only
live-stock that has increased its numbers, according
to Trivett, is the horse —possibly to prove the claim
of Ikey Mo that his policy of Bar Yon is among our
great natural resources. Horses have increased
27,437, but Isaac’s odds are no longer than they
were. Supplementing Trivett’s figures, I find that
Flies (common, blow and varied) are 92,117,474,-
179,134,642,192 more.
Fleas (nonsuch and Rothschild) 143,719,062 more.
Mosquitoes (plain and colored), no figures, but be-
lieved to be greatly on the increase.
There is also a large increase in the number of
meat-eaters for N.S.W.; hence an increase in the
price of meat may be joyfully anticipated.
Note: MA’s lOU’s also show a large increase.

“Mutton Bird”: Launceston (Tas.) is rubbing its
eyes and waking up to the fact that it owns a
port. An expert (foreign, of course) has just told
it, what its own officers had been dinning into its
ears for decades past, that there is more water in
the channel than there is at either Melbourne or
Sydney. He continues: “There are few ports indeed
in which an unobstructed channel from
which all dangerous eddies have been eliminated,
with a depth of 30ft. at first and afterwards of 36ft.
at low water, and from 40ft. to 46ft. at high water,
and a minimum width of 1200 ft., can either be
formed or maintained.” For years the townlet has
had a Marine Board and a City Council. The
latter’s chief function has, apparently, been to pour
sewage into the stream, and the others to spoon it
out again with an antiquated dredge. The rate-
payer has to foot the bill for it all, but he has been
too sleepy to kick. The local Board has had expert
advice before this, and has adopted bits of it and
disregarded the rest, with the result that during the
last 15 or 20 years some £70,000 or £BO,OOO has
been spent with nothing to show for it. At the
present time the pool where the crack ship lies is
being dredged of 9ft. of soft mud that has accumu-
lated in six months. This pool was formed in direct
opposition to the last expensive expert’s report.
However, the fact remains that a deep-water port
can be formed at Bell Bay, on the Tamar—a port
that will make both Melbourne and Sydney sit up
and take notice.

THE SLUMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Slump—the downward whiz of things, cam-
erados I
The homing of the Loan Bird and the up-perching of
the Great Deficit are at hand.
A Voice goes forth in the night-time and a Warning
at noon-day; but who are we that we should
heed them?
The money-rate is nearing Five per Cent., anticipat-
ing some Event to which the whole creation
moves.
The revenue declines and stringency increases; they
are putting off hands in hope of putting off the
Evil Day!
Money is so obviously tight that even one of
McCohen’s Jaypees would have to convict.
Seven good seasons—peradventure eight—have there
been, camerados: who will prophesy a Ninth?
A cloud of lOU’s, terrible and fierce as harpies, and
far more expensive, obscures the Sun of our
Prosperity.
The voice of Ma crieth in the financial wilderness:
“Vare, legion es redde I”
Which is to say: “James, give me back my mil-
lions!”
But alas! the petition of Ma rises unheeded; foi
McCohen either sleepeth, or is gone upon a jour-
ney in a State motor-car, or openeth a Sunday-
school, or layeth a foundation-stone, or biteth
the ear of Bull-Cohen!
The Great Deficit approaches, and behold the Slump,
bearing Taxation in his wings!
And Cost-of-Living, which some take to be the very
Beast of Revelation, rises, like the answer to
the old mock-riddle —
“The higher it goes the fewer.”
(The fewer little luxuries, camerados!)
Woe to the Picture Shows 1 Destitution menaceth
the Peanut Man when the Slump shall be sore
in the Land.
But as for McCohen, he shall go up to the house of
Noses and make exceeding merry.
Things will (or should) last his time!
“Blessed are the politically dead who hanged Pos-
terity !”
“Even so,” saith the Griffith, “for they rest from
their neighbors; their loans do follow them.”
Even as the wings of the Slump o’ershadow us is the
merry, merry song of the McGriffin heard
among the brickworks —yet, even in the pipe,
or tripe, factory !
It is not now as it hath been of yore,
Nine millions borrowed—what can I ask more f
Turn wheresoe’er I may,
By night or by day,
The loans which I have raised I now can raise no
more !
The Market comes and goes,
And shining is the Nose;
Lend on, sweet Uncles, and cursed be he who first
cries “Hold l Enough—Show New South Wales
the door 1”....
But £107,000,000, camerados! I
And the McGriffin still vigorously sowing pawn-seeds
and burbling of ten or fifteen more millions!
O glorious crop of loans!
This is the end of the Section, camerados; this is
where Ma gets off. If she doesn’t, she will be
pushed off.
For behold 1 the Slump, bearing Taxation in his
wings ; whose raiment is the Sack and whose
Sword is the Knife of Retrenchment!
The Downward Whiz- of Things is heard; the Day
of the Empty Bottle is at hand!

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If vou are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hoar of a simple and scientific device which restores
hoarine no matter how old you are. No mystery or
""■“y about it; we describe it fully, and explain
i„«t how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
flors and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
ahle No one can tell you are wearing them. Thev
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trving to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear Thev protect the tender inner parts of the
ear that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds. ,
So that vou mav clearly understand how the Sound
\fflfmifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
vevs even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum,
firing of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend . _
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair You will never
regret trying ti-e Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured and you can be cured too. You may wea
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them ou
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (w<
have special sizes for children from six to twelve)
Even a child can insert and remove them without thi
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s singh
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are onli
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also ar
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but th<
pair you get at first will last quite two years. D<
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them oui
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use th<
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent yoi
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as yov

Peps Guard
Throat & Lungs.
Everyone needs Peps at this time
of the year, because this scientific
breathable medicine in tablet form
gives just the help Nature requires
to fight against the hidden perils of
chilly July, when the weather is
treacherous. Be it only a husky
cough, a slight irritation in the
throat, or just a suspicion of pain
and soreness about the chest, it is
time to take a few Peps, which are
entirely different from old-fashioned loz-
enges and drug-laden mixtures, but infinitely
more effective.
The Peps way of stopping chest troubles is Nature’s
way. As the little brown tablet dissolves in the
mouth, the medicinal pine-air is released in the form of
fumes which mix with the breath and thus convey a valuable
soothing and strengthening agent direct through the bronchial
tubes to the lungs, which cannot be reached by liquid mixtures that are
simply swallowed into the stomach.
A Comforting Glow in the CHest,
as the Peps fumes enter, stimulates the whole of the breathing organs, and
means defence against coughs, colds and chills, which, unresisted, would
work havoc with the strongest constitution. The Peps fumes are not
merely antiseptic, but germicidal. They destroy the cold-germ, protect the
delicate lining membrane of the throat and bronchial tubes from dangerous
infection, and positively arrest chest trouble in its earliest stage.
There can be no finer safeguard against the perils of July’s chilly days
than Peps, which are a unique concentration of the particular medicines
which Nature has furnished for the treatment of human throat and chest
ailments. Peps contain no opium or other harmful drugs, and are as
useful to the apparently robust as they are absolutely indispensable to the
weak-chested and convalescent. PEPS NIP A COLD IN THE BUD.
PEPS GO DIRECT TO THE LUNGS
Pep*, the unequalled
remedy for Throat
and Chest com-
plaints, are obtain-
able from all
chemists, at 1/6 and
3/- per box ; or direct
from Peps Pastille
Co., 39 Pitt Street,

“THE TRUE BREATHING CUBE.”
THE,
QUESTION of the DAY.
The question of to-day,
of to-morrow and of
every succeeding day is
HAVE YOU USED PEARS’ SOAP ?
If you have not, you have not
done your duty by your skin and
complexion. If, on the other hand
that is, on both hands, and on the
face, and on the skin generally—you
HAVE used PEARS, you can feel
happy, for you will have done the
best that possibly can be done tor
the skin’s health and beauty. There
can be no question about that,
PEARS has been making beautiful
complexions for nearly 120 years.
PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion.
The Curse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[■s Her wake: I saw Her take
A star’s reflection from out the lake
. d me sh it amid Her coal black hair
Till it glimmered in golden ambush there.
Where the dying sun His blood outguslied
' „ cr i mS on haemorrhage, She thrust
ler fingers into the pool and lent
Her lips and cheeks red ravishment.
Suf ely in Heaven or Hell was ne’er
Beauty like Hers as I saw Her there.
•v," „ fiosom knew no heave of breath.
Whose lips were freighted with dreadful
death.
Prom twilight tints for Herself She wove
Unites more wanton than those of Hove,
Till it seemed, Her beauty so fearful sweet,
That Love, not She, were the counterfeit.
tnd I prayed to Hod that in pity lie
Should kill this Thing and not let Her be
I ike love in seeming, like love arrayed—
A wanton in Love’s masquerade.
T saw Her wait: so dire a hate
(Or was it Love unconsummate?)
Flared from Her dark abysmal eyes,
Who looks upon Her once, he dies.
Filling with oversweet the air
Were flowers, flaunting and debonair —
Crimson, bronzed and leprous white
And black with the velvet black of night.
Some were speckled and blotched, and some
Smeared with an iridescent scum.
In shape so strange that it would seem
A mad god wrought them in his dream.
And to and fro, and to and fro,
In measure drowsed, lethargic, slow,
They swayed their petalled heads as though
To lull some deep ancestral woe.
All was silent and still as death :
Silence Herself, with indrawn breath,
Cupped a hand to Her fragile ear.
Listening the suitors drawing near.
In merry wflse, with glad acclaim,
Nearer and nearer yet they came
To reach the trysting place, the while ;
She lured them on with Her subtle smile.
Now they were come: with laughter long
They lifted their voices in ribald song.
They quaffed their wine, they pledged Her
eyes
As sweeter than aught in Paradise.
Draining in bitter sweet Her charms,
One by one they leapt to Her arms,
They leapt to Her arms and all was over.
.She gleaned them all for Her lord, Her
lover.
• • • • •
I saw Her rise: the eastern skies
Were flushed with dawn. T saw Her eyes
Daze on the victims who had sipped
Death from Her beauty, poison-lipped.
I saw Her eyes : not triumph there
Was mirrored, nor was it despair,
But rather a monstrous love that seemed
Fearful of hoping the hope it dreamed.
Grey vapors rose from up the ground
Whirling in gusty eddies round,
And as they rose, grew yet more dense
Then sank as a heavy pestilence.
Within the coiling mist’s embrace
Stood She, a ghoul, with all the grace
Of yester eve from off Her fled —
A ghoul who slavered o’er its dead.
Then slow She shambled down the way,
Bast where Her stark white lovers lay
And, crooning an incantation. She
Called on Her Master to claim His fee.
I heard Her call —a call that seemed
A wailing now, and now she screamed,
Despairing cries of one distraught
With fearful agony of thought.
And then it was the grisly crew
Of Dead Men clattered into view ;
Death Himseif did follow after,
Rattling His ribs in merry laughter.
The wooers rose, the new won dead
Who had found a bier in Her bridal bed ;
They tottered up on their withered shanks
And joined Her earlier lovers’ ranks.
There in the mist, in the dawning grey,
They marched, they marched, they marched
away,
And up the sun rose in His might
Cleansing the foetid airs of night.
But She remained : the sunlight played
Fpon ITer shrunken limbs and made
A newer beauty blossom there —
In love’s despite, to Life’s despair!

BERNARD INGKERY.
Mrs. Bellevue’s Butler.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ItIW Y dear Mrs. Mirlgely-Blatters,”
|f| cried the stout lady with the
glasses, “I assure you there’s not
a maid to be had ! I’ve been waiting in that
wretched place for hours, and have been in-
terviewed by some of the most impertinent
girls I ever came across in my life! And
now I haven’t got anyone!”
Mrs. Midgely-Blatters, stout and tightly
hobbled, sighed sympathetically amidst her
furs.
The old gentleman in the waiting motor
rustled his evening paper impatiently. The
chauffeur looked stolidly ahead. The two
wmnen jabbered on eagerlv.
From some recess a burly loafer emerged
and, with the beerlight in his eye, bore hun-
grily down on the two fashionables-'
“Spare us thrippence for a bed, lady?' he
whined, looking from one to the other.
“My dear,” cried Mrs. Midgely-Blatters,
and turned up her eyes. The other looked
triumphant and pleased. (They hadn t
heard the appeal.) ,
“Spare a pore man thrippence, lady:
blustered the sturdy beggar at their elbows.
Both women recoiled. The martyr of the
registry office recovered her breath first.
“Go away at once 1” she commanded; "go
away and earn some money instead of beg-
ging for it. How dare you interrupt usY”
The beer-seeker had had a very dry day
and he lost his temper altogether. ‘Go
away yourself,” he jeered. "Go home and
do yer own work instead of looking for pore
girls to do it for yer! Go ’omq au’ cook
yer old man’s dinner! Go an’ do some-
thing for yer furs an’ feathers instead of
livin’ on yer ole man’s charity.”
“Howard!” called the stout lady hysteri-
cally to the old gentleman in the motor. But
the traffic was heavy just then, and both the
old gentleman and the chauffeur missed the
call for help.
“Where is a constable?” shrilled Mrs.
Midgely-Blatters, revolving helplessly.
“Nice sort you are to tell a man ter get
work,” continued the baffled beer-eater. “You
never do a stroke yerself, an’ yet w’en a
man asks yer for a thrippence”
Then arrived from somewhere au abject,
half-clean man in clothes which were one
size too small for him, and an incongruous
hard felt hat of the square shape affected by
some elderly citizens. He laid restraining
hands on the bully and started to shut him
from the scene by whining:—
“’Ere, Dosser, Dosser! These ladies is
friends o’ mine!”
Dosser was about to sweep him contempt-
uously aside when the newcomer caught him
by the shoulder and whispered something in
his large, fat ear. On the instant Dosser
shrivelled, and with hunched shoulders
shuffled rapidly up the street and round Lhe
nearest corner.
The half-clean man took off his square hat
and sidled up to the two women. “After-
noon, Mrs. Bellevue,” he mumbled humbly.
The lady of the registry office looked at
him with shining eyes.
“Thank you, Wagglin,” she gushed. “I
don’t know what we would have done with-
out you. It was very brave of you,
Wagglin!”
"Don’t mention it, Mrs. Bellevue,” whined
the half-clean man with the smirk of the
pampered dependent. “I jus’ told ’im that
Mr. Bellevue was the K.C., an’ that settled
’im.”
Mrs. Bellevue drew Mrs. Midgely-Blatters’
attention to their rescuer. “This is the man
I once told you about, dear, a most deserving
person. He is a reformed character and
attends the classes established by our
society for the dissemination of sound polit-
ical principles among the lower orders.” She
turned towards the motor and called the old
gentleman, “Howard !”
This time the reader heard. Butting down
his paper, he looked over his glasses and
said, “Are you ready to go home now?”
His wife flushed angrily. “Of course, you
didn’t hear that wretched loafer insult Mrs.
Midgely-Blatters and myself just now !”
“I certainly didn’t. Why didn’t you call
me?” . ,
“I did call you, but you didn t hear! I
don’t know uhat we would have done but
for Wagglin here. He came without being
called.” , ,
The old gentleman looked round and ob-
served the smirking Wagglin for the first
time. His expression instantly changed for
the worse. “Ha!” he ejaculated in an un-
pleasant tone, and threw himself back in his
seat again. .
“Is there anythin’ else I can do for you,
Mrs. Bellevue?” asked the half-clean man
eagerly. The old gentleman cleared his
throat and slapped his paper with the back
of his hand.
The stout lady looked sorrowfully at her
dirty knight. “Ah, Wagglin, if you were
only a housemaid !”
Wagglin anxiously shuffled his hat.
“I don’t know as I ever told yer, Mrs.
Bellevue, that I was once stooard at a club.
Mrs. Bellevue looked at him hard for a
minute. Then her eyes glittered like a
bird’s, and she delightedly patted Mrs.
Midgely-Blatters’ arm. “The very idea!
she chirped. “The very idea. Wby didn t I
think of it before? Wagglin could be gener-
ally useful about the house.” . .
The half-clean man shuffled his hat taster
than ever and writhed with delight. Mrs.
Midgely-Blatters smiled and nodded under-
standingly. , . ,
“My dear, I have quite made up my mind.
Wagglin will come home with us now in the
motor. Now I really must not keep Howard
waiting any longer. You will come along
on Thursday, won’t you? Good-bye, dear .
The two stout ladies pecked at eacn
other’s cheeks. The old gentleman raised
his hat in a pre-occupied way Mrs.
Midgely-Blatters tottered off amiably in tne
direction of the railway station.
Howard didn’t notice Wagglin sitting be-
side the scornful chauffeur till the motor
had gone three blocks. It gave him a con-
siderable shock when he made the discovery.
“Good heavens! What is this filthy scoun-
drel doing in the car ?
Mrs. Bellevue was not accustomed to sup-
plying her husband with explanations.
“I have some work for him, she replied
St *“Well I don’t see why he should disfigure
the car,” grumbled the old gentleman, and
took refuge in silence. The chauffeur went
as fast as he dared so that the journey with
the half-clean man should be brief. As they
flew on, the wind swirled round the plate
glass shield and plucked at the incongruous
hat. Wagglin put up a half-clean hand and
clung to the brim. . .
On reaching the house, Howard hurried
off to his study. Mrs. Bellevue led her
dependent towards the gardeners quarters
„nd after giving that official some hurned
orders! left in his charge and went
into the house. A few moments later she
emerged with a bundle of men s clothes, said
something about “a hot bath,” and disap-
peared. Time passed, bath water flowed
copiously, the cook sang in the kitchen and
the gardener hurried about chuckling to him-
self Finally, at seven o clock, when the gong
droned its summons, the old gentleman
strolled into the lamp-lit dining-room and
took his seat opposite his wife, with Ins back
to the door. Noticing some slight anxiety
in her manner he grunted amiably, New
servant. I presume!” , , ,
The door opened. His wife looked up and
smiled radiantly. . ~ . .
“Very good indeed. Wagglin. she said. _
Her husband whirled round m his chair
and found the half-clean man, freshly
scrubbed and oiled, garbed in a second-best
dress suit that he knew very well. The
oiled man had a plate of soup in each hand
and his expression was a nervous imitation

REPORT FROM
Mr. CLEMENT L. WRAGGE, F.R.G.S.
Mi. CLEMENT L. WRAGGE, F.R.G.S., Met Soc., F.R.C.1., late Government
Meteorologist of Queensland, and of Mount Kosciusko Observatory, also late lecturer to
the Government of India, and founder of the Wragge Museum at Stafford, Eng., writes
the following unsolicited letter, the original of which may be seen at our office:—- 3
Messrs. Foster-McClellan Co.,
Sydney.
Port Pirie,
April 19th, 1913.
Dear Sirs, —
Some weeks ago I must kave caught a chill, and thereafter I suffered agonies from
backache. A friend suggested that I should try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and this I did.
I am now about to state a simple fadt, and that is that one bottle of these Pills completely cured
Tins testimonial is entnely unsolicited, and I send it in the hope that it may benefit humanity
and for no other reason whatever. “The proof of the pudding is in the eating,” and you may
be sure that I am grateful, inasmuch that I am now able to continue my nightly scientific ledfures
in ease and comfort.
You can publish this as you think fit.
\ours sincerely,
(Sgd.) CLEMENT L. WRAGGE, F.R.G.S.,
Scientific Lecturer.
Pain in the back is the kidneys’ signal of distress. If this timely warning is ignored, kidney disease silently fastens its deadly grin—for
kidney sickness first shows itself in pains afnd disorders in other parts, and the real cause is too often hidden until fatal Bright’s disease or
diabetes has set m. Suspect the kidneys if you are rheumatic and nervous, or have lame hack, painful, too frequent or scantv°urination wpak
heart dizzy spells, headaches, bloating or neuralgia. What you want is a special kidney medicine- not an experiment butone stood the

of the average stage butler’s. The old gen-
tleman rose from nis chair with a jerk and
started to search for words. At last, after
so^ e spluttering, he found what he wanted.
“Well, d —n my eyes! So you’ve got into
the house, have you?”
The new domestic had evidently braced
himself for something of the kind. He re-
plied gravely, “I beg your pardon, sir! I
’opes as how I shall suit!”
“Bah!” cried the old gentleman explo-
sively, and sitting down he unfolded his
serviette.
The meal proceeded in awful silence while
Wagglin was in the room. Directly he left
it eating was suspended.
“Is this dirty vagrant a fixture?” de-
manded the master of the house.
“If he can do the work of the maid I
can’t get! And you are unjust in calling
him a dirty vagrant. He has just had a hot
bath and complete change.”
"Of my clothes!” snapped the master
furiously. “And what’s the go< d of one bath
to a scoundrel like that? He should be
boiled for a week before he is let into a
decent house ! Bah !”
* * * »
Wagglin came in again. “Did you ring,
lady—mum—l mean?”
Mrs. Bellevue rewarded him with, a bril-
liant smile. “Not yet, Wagglin. We are
not quite finished.”
Wagglin bowed like an elderly clown and
started towards the door. He half opened it,
paused irresolute for a moment, and then
skidded nervously uo to the old gentleman.
“Can I do anything for you, sir?”
“Yes!” blazed the old gentleman in sud-
den fury, “you can get out!”
“Cert’nly, sir!” mumbled the butler, as if
he half-expected that was the only thing
wanted.
“Hold on!” commanded his hostile em-
ployer. “What’s that disgusting stuff
you’ve got on your head ?”
“’Air oil, sir. The gard’ner give it to me.”
“Why, it smells like the stuff Millege puts
in the motor! Are you certain you didn't
get it from the chauffeur?”
“Yessir, I am.”
“Well, never put it on again! Do you
hear?”
“Yessir. Is —is there anythin’ else about
me you don’t like, sir, that I can alter?”
Mr. Bellevue eyed his abject employee
very carefully in ferocious silence. “You’re
not trying to be impudent, are you?” he
blustered in his most terrifying manner.
“Oh no, sir !”
“Because if I thought you were I”
“You may go, Wagglin,” interrupted the
mistress nervously. The wretched man
made his fumbling escape.
“A nice, well-oiled idiot to have in the
house!” snorted the old gentleman as the
door closed.
Mrs. Bellevue sighed resignedly and rang
the bell.
* * * *
Next morning when the old gentleman
appeared at the head of the stairs on his
way to breakfast he found Wagglin with
the morning paper waiting at the foot. The
faithful retainer was still in full evening
dress. “Mornin’. sir,” he mumbled, handing
over the clumsily-folded sheet. “I see by
the cables that the Turks have bin at it
again, sir. They’ve bin committin’ more
atrocities, sir.”
“I wish you would go and commit some
dusting instead of loafing round reading,”
retorted his grateful master.
"Beg pardon, sir,” said Wagglin with
dignity; "I was jus’ tryin’ to improve me
mind. sir. I shan’t ever do it again.”
“Oh, I don’t want you to give it up alto-
gether. Go on improving your mind when
you’ve got nothing else to do.”
“Thank you, sir,” said the flattened serv-
ing man. and taking a dusky rag out of his
tail pocket, went about flapping and polish-
ing in a listless way.
The old gentleman went to the morning
room chuckling savagely and settled down
before the fire.
Presently he heard a rustling on the stairs,
an exchange of words, and then the butler’s
mournful tones: “Very good, lady—mum, I
mean. I shan’t take any notice of ’im,
mum. Yes, I see. I've got to humor ’im.”
Bellevue threw down his paper and
swore. Breakfast was nearly all argument.
* * * *
Wagglin had successfully infested the
house for a fortnight when one evening; as
the old gentleman was walking among his;
roses, he heard a scornful voice say dis-
“That’s not ’im. , That’s the ole pot
’isself!” As he turned three heads bobbed
down behind the hedge.
He strode over and discovered three
dossers in hiding. “What are you three
men doing here?”
A filthy man in a straw hat fidgeted. “We
was waitin’ to see Wagglin, sir, if you don’t
mind.”
“’E gen’rally ’as somethin’ fer us, sir,”
broke in a sheep-faced man.
“A few scraps an’ such, sir,” muttered
the biggest of the three.
“Scraps be blowed!” cried the sheep-
faced man impulsively. “Why, I never
seen”
“The leavin's of th’ table an’ such-like,”
interjected the big man hurriedly.
“An’ cigar butts, sir,” added the straw-
hatted one nervously. “I hope you don’t
mind Wagglin givin’ us these trifles, sir?”
The big loafer chimed in in his turn: “It
gives us a little bit o’ pleasure, sir. We
don’t get much, sir.” The pathetic note
was artistically struck, but the sheep-faced
man spoilt it.
“Yer see, sir,”- —with breathless anxiety
—-“we ain’t ’ad work f’r munce an’ munce,
sir.”
The big man turned on him savagely.
“Why don’t yer tell the gennelman w’y?
’E knows there’s work to be got jus’ as well
as us; but he don’ know 7 that none of us
pore devils is able t’ do it. Look at all th’
work I could ’ave got if me back ’adn’t bin
weak !” He subsided with dignity.
The sheep-faced man shuffled his feet
miserably. “It’s me had eyes that keeps me
from work,” he whined. “I oughter be in
the ’orspittle still !”
The straw-hatter observed that it was his
turn. “Ever since I fell orf that there lad-
der three years ago, I ain’t bin able to do
nothin’. It’s me ’eart,” he remarked sor-
rowfully.
The old gentleman, who had remained
grimly silent throughout, looked from one to
the other. “Very well,” he replied at last.
“I don’t mind you having the things, but
you mustn't hang about too much, mind !”
As he turned away there was a grateful
chorus of “Oh no, sir ! You can depend on
us. sir!” They would have blessed him
had they dared.
it was down at the far end of the garden
that the disastrous informer made his ap-
pearance. The master of the house was
critically surveying a climbing rose when a
dusty hat and face rose beyond it and the
owner of both remarked in a hoarse voice :
“Don’t h’lieve a word them lyin’ cows tells
yer, mister. They’re rookin’ yer for yer
cigars an’ whisky!”
“How do you know that?” barked the
master of the house, infuriated at this fur-
ther invasion of his privacy by such a
grimy outcast.
“’Ow do I know it!” chanted the Face.
“Why they’ve bin callin’ ’ere ev’ry night
an’ gettin’ jus’ what they wanted ever since
Dosser found out the lydy ’ad took in Creep-
in’ Jimmy-—Wagglin, that is. They told
’im if he didn’t pass out somethin’ quick an’
lively they’d tell ’er ’bout th’ time ’e stole
th’ ducks from Guv’mint ’Ouse.”
“And what are you telling me this for,
eh?”
“Becos,” said the Face vindictively, “be-
cos th’ mein swine wouldn’t give a bloke
anythin’ w’eh ’e arsked for it! I told ’em
I’d put their pots on !”
It took the old gentleman a second or
two to realise that the blindly-enraged in-
former was referring to himself and his
futile attempts to obtain a share of the
stolen property. When he did, he shouted,
“GET OUT!”
The Face disappeared instantly.
“Now for the vice-regal duck-stealer,”
muttered the victim fiercely, and made to-
wards the other end of the garden, lie was
just in time. “Creeping Jimmy” Wagglin
was busily engaged distributing cigars to
the trio on the other side of the hedge.
“Three each,” lie was saying. “That’s all
I can get t’-night, becos th’ box is near
empty. An’ there’s ’arf a bottle o’ whisky,
an’ lemme tell yer it took some gettin’. ’E
don’t get through much, an’ I ’ad to worter
three bottles to make up this lot.”
“Oh, did you!”
The piratical three broke and fled as if a
bomb had burst in front of them. Like
unkempt birds of prey they flapped heavily
down the road. Dosser, bearing the stolen
bottle of whisky, panted heavily in the rear.
Wagglin, quite unnerved, stood as if he
expected shortly to be kicked hard. Mean-
while he whined, “Oh sir !.... Oh sir ! I
’>ped to live and die with you. sir!”
“Like your damned impudence!” fumed
his employer.
“I wouldn’t have give ’em enythink, sir,
only they said they’d tell yer I useter nick
th’ boots off drunks in the parks. But I
swear blind, sir, I never nicked eny man’s
boots.”
“I don’t believe you, you dirty scoundrel!
What about the Government House ducks?''’
“I never did! I never stole no ducks
from no one !”
“Who said you did?” thundered the law-
yer. (Wagglin reeled as he realised his
awful mistake.) “Up to the house and get
your hat!” commanded the K.C., advancing
and waving his victim before him. “I
believe you’d steal anything! Get,/our iuU
and clear out! D’ye hear?” drove
Wagglin slowly up to the house and watched
him extract his incongruous hat from some
dusty hiding-place under the stairs. Then
he escorted him to the verandah.
“I can’t give yer hack yer dress clothes
sir,” moaned the ejected as lie went side-
ways down the steps.
"Do you think I’d wear them after you?’' >
howled the old gentleman furiously, “tvi
rather he shot.”
‘‘Mrs. Bellevue burnt me other clothes
sir. Now I ain’t got nothin’ but these yer ”
“Count yourself lucky you’ve got any- i
thing. Now, off you go.”
Wagglin made a last desperate appeal
from the path.
“I’ll he larfed at. sir. in these clothes'-
Ain't you got nothin’ you don’t want, sir
in the way of a coat an’ vest?”
“Now look here! I’ve let you off for Si
pilfering. If you don’t stop talking and
clear out. I'll ring up the police.*’
Creeping Jimmy half sobbed. “Orright
Mr. Bellevue, sir! I’m goin’! But before
I go —an', mind yer. these is me larst words
to you—if it should ever happen that you
come down in this world through no fault
of yer own. an’ some rotten liars sez ’as
’ow you shook th’ boots orf drunks an'
gutter way with two pair of prize ducks
from Guv’mint 'Ouse” -
''Th(it'll do!” screamed the enraged j
householder.
Wagglin gave him one last reproachful
glance, and. turning away, shambled down
the path to face a ribald world in full even-
ing dress and the incongruous hat.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When we were children, do you remember
I’Twas long ago, in a dear lost time—
’Twas April then, and ’tis now November)
How the wonder came and the gift of rhyme?
Sitting around the rosewood table.
The lamplight bright on each fair young head.
She led us enchanted through woods of Fable
With maidens, magicians and kings long
dead.
Oune, long gone, are those nights of wonder;
Dead, long dead, is each pure young day;
Hut still the great waves clash in thunder
On the haunted edges of Galway Bay.
The mystic rath, and the shadowed water
Of moonlit loughs, and the tall, dark trees,
The sighing winds and the flowers taught her
The secret soul of their melodies.
Though the world may mar and the years
enslave us,
And our feet halt and falter and stray.
Let us still thank her for the love she gave
us,
For the stars she lit for our boyhood’s way.
Let us still thank God for the sweet, white
mother,-
Not lost, but found ’mid the Shining Ones,
\vn,, ever and ever (take heart, my brother!
Still pleads the cause of her singing sons.

IT IS A WISE PRECAUTION
to take the greatest care of your health. In order to do this
effectually it is necessary from time to time to take a few doses
of the right medicine —one that will regulate and tone up the
digestive system. There ought to be no difficulty in deciding
what that is. The verdict in favour of Beecham’s Pills is
overwhelming. Many people find it an excellent plan
TO TAKE
them periodically. They are the remedy, par excellence, for
cleansing the system from impurities and ensuring a correct and
regular action of the important organs of digestion, assimilation,
and execretion. Vigour of body and mind, are the portion only
of the healthy. Remember, then, that health may be established
and maintained by the use of that old and well-tried remedy—

The British “Waverley”
The “Waverley” is a beautiful car. It has the long, low body and graceful
lines which make it essentially the doctor’s car.
With the exception of the engine—which is French —the car is wholly
British and absolutely dependable. The unique method of suspending the
rear of the body on double, laminated springs, bolted direct to back axle,
makes road shocks almost impossible. This method of springing a car is
registered, and you can only get it in a “Waverley.”
It is ready for work day or night, rain or shine, is light on tyres, petrol,
and oil, and gives a service as free from noise as it is reliable.
We’re ready to run you anywhere in Sydney for a trial trip. Where shall
it be? Telephone City 4352, and make an appointment to-day. The car is
one of the most luxurious you’ve ever ridden in. •
