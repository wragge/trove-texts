THE RED PAGE.
Last night, that seemed a rather satisfactory bit
of sen-tiuient : this morning it looks somewhat
thin and waily. But it may go as an expression
of a moo 1, acknowledging two echoes —
One from Henley’s
Crosses and. troubles a-many havp proved me.
One or two women (God bless them !) have loved me.
I have worked and dreamed, and I’ve talked at will.
.Of art and drink I have had my fill.
I’ve comforted here, I’ve suer ured there.
I’ve faced my foes, and I’ve backed my friends.
I've blundered, and sometimes m >de amends.
I have prayed for light, and I’ve known despair.
Now I look hefore, as I look behind,
Cotne storm, come shine, whatever befall.
With a grateful heart, and a constant mind,
For the end I know is the best of all.
and the other from an uifset brilliant of Will Ogilvie’s,
‘called ‘My Lover, the Bush,’ which ends—
The winds of Dawn are moving,
The river oaks astir . . .
What heart were lorn of loving
That had no Love but her?
Till last red stars are lighted
(Ogilvie is very fond of ‘ red stars ’)
And last winds wander West,
Her fait.h and mine are plighted—
The Lover I love best!
though pro-
bably the not-very-recondite ideas would have
been suggested anyway. However, it were
ungracious to send Burns to Parnassus by
the steep and thorny way of strict originality
while dallying one’s-self along another fellow’s
primrose path.
* * * *
The mood brought itself while I was thinking
over George Black’s now historic apology for the
legendary song-Burns. .Judging by Scottish cor-
respondents’comments, the champion’s affirma-
tion of the essential originality of Burns has been
especially justified by his numerous admissions of
unoriginality ; and the slightly inconsequent affir-
mation that the average Scot knew all about the
unoriginality of this original poet has been deci-
sively corroborated by the statement that, out
of some 150 editions of Bnrus, only “at least
one-third ’’ contained notes to show where his un-
originality came in. Two Scottish commentators
in the score or so are disposed to admit that
there may be a liere-aud-there spot which the
whitewash does not cover, and these urge the
familiar plea that the spot is 4 a very little one’—
- reiterating, in fact, the national explanation that
We are ns fou, we’re nae that fou,
But just a drappie in our e’e!
‘And if Robbie did help himself to a wee
verse now and then,’ asks one, ‘is it for that
you would call him plagiarist?’ This was all
expected, for no quill oan pierce the doubled
armour of patriotism and prejudice. The profit of
paper-staining was looked for in non-Caledonian
skulls. And, lest there should remain the slightest
chance of misapprehension, it seemed desirable to
criticise the critic in as much detail as space
would permit. So I commenced —
If George Black, M.P., does not get every Caledonian
vote in Gipps electorate at the coming contest, then
there is no gratitude in Scotchmen. To shield the
national idol’s clay feet he has exposed his
own body. A beautiful 8, eoiinen of Henley’s ‘ Common
Bunisite ’ . . .
* * * *
I had written thus far when my pen flagged for
a moment, and I came out on my little mountain
verandah under the sky and fell to thinking. I
saw my commentary quite clearly. I meant to
appeal a-priori, and ask was not I, an Australian
free from the fetish-influence, more likely to
judge Burns impartially from the standpoint
of .Literature than was G. 8., biased by Scots
tradition and training. Then I meant to
quote some of G.B.’s own ponderous, uninspired
verses, and to ask whether a man who wrote
like that 'could possibly be a judge of what
was or was not poetry Then I would point out
how the Common Burnsite cult caused nausea by
its extravagant pretensions regarding its divinity,
and how eminently desirable it was that the bubble
should be'pricked and some of the patriotic gas
let out. And 1 would add that the real gold in
Burns did not need this continual gilding, and
that were Burns alive he would be first to protest.
Then I had it in mind to expand a previous hint,
and to ask what credit a man would have
to-day who vamped his work like the
s >ng-Burns did ; and what would he said
of the perfervid enthusiasts who today kept
on extolling their hero for achievements
which he did not perform and for qualities which
he did not possess. Then I intended to review
my reviewer in as much detail as possible, and to
point out how he misrepresented some things
through carelessness
As when, in defending ‘Landlady, count the lawin’,’
he parallels a vamped verse, not with the original it was
vamped from, but with another verse which it obviously
was not vamped from, and which nobody ever said or
hinted it was vamped from.
and how he misrepresented
other things through dullness;
As when he failed to see that a race may be fairly
described as unpoetical to-day without affecting the dic-
tum that it produced poets in the last century—just as
in the Byzantine period the Greek race was unpoetioal
despite Sappho and Homer.
and how, generally
speaking, his apparent deficiency in poetical sym-
pathy, and an apparent mental nearsightedness
which attaches undue importance to the letter
which killeth, and not due importance to the spirit
which giveth life, caused him to leave his pro-
tege, on the whole, in worse case than he
found him in. I had no doubt of clearing away
the larger ddbris cast on my thesis—and contro-
versy over details is interminable.
» * * *
Yet, somehow, under the sky, I did not feel so
satisfied with the programme. It was not that it
was not a good programme, yet it did not seem to
me the best. Polemics have their uses ; satire and
invective are necessary to pierce thick hides and
dull intelligences ; and warmth is not truthless
because it tends to wax untruthful. But the night
was so calm, so clear, so bright. The day, like
Agag, had walked delicately to death, and hardly
a ripple of sound flowed over the stillness. Only
far down the descent a train muttered with gnaw-
ing persistence, and across the garden-path a single
frog boomed softly.
Pity that the really poetic frog has such an unpoetic
name—even the splendidly onomatopceio p uddock of G.B.’s
vernacular fails to do justice to his chorus—much less to
his solo. One would like something long-vowelled and
slow and musicianly—Dvorak might do—sounded guttu-
rally, Dvawrahk! Dvawrahk !
And Goethe’s rest was on
all the peaks ; the tree-ragged ridges lay along
sombrely, brooding and brooding. Away above,
the half-moon tossed through a smother of cirri
which hunted her like a pack of lap-dogs, rolling
over and over to be shaken off with an almost
perceptible indignation, and continually re-leaping
upon her. In the moon’s wake one dark star
sailed steadily. And everything was so hushed
that you leant to catch with a sense finer than
hearing the murmur of something more delicate
than sound—strained to see an invisible motion
which seemed to thrill through the motionless
depths of obscurity ’: maybe—who knows?—it was
the bosom of Mother Space lifting with the
breathing of a sleeping Universe. “ In ooelo
quies,” they say—“ in coelo quies ! ”
* * » *
And I thought of George Black—of his past,
and his present, and his future, and of the zeal
with which he, like the rest of us, frets and fumes
over his little fancies, and vehemently tries to
impress upon the world as the whole face of Truth
the single facet which he sees. I thought of his
life as it had been told to me —of the stolid boy
imbibing his Burns in the fair town of Edinbro,
where all the lawyers in embryo and all the law-
yers matured swarm through the streets in the
gullies and the streets on the ridges, or sit on the
doorsteps to dangle good Scotch feet in the attic
windows of the neighbors underneath. I saw
him coming as ‘colonial-experienoer’ to Australia,
drifting through—no, not drifting fighting
through the cycle of bush life with more
pluck than pence ; taking to his pen and labo-
riously improving his prose—yea, even his verse,
as far as it lay in him ; —I saw him canvassing,
framing pictures, cleaning boots at an hotel; I
heard him lecturing at the Cyclorama, to
an audience of nine country - folk and three
hens employed on board-wages to make the
foreground realistic : and all the while he
was plodding on with his eyes open for
advancement, never quitting the engrained faith
of every Scot that the world is his oyster. Then
I remembered his press-work ; his advocacy of
Socialism —heavy indeed, but impregnated with
an honest desire to help to make a better earth
for better men ; I remembered his dull, laborious
speeches, shining with an earnest intention
to impress upon his hearers such ideals as
he saw ; I remembered instances of his
ability, of his generosity, and many ex-
pressions of his belief that he was the born and
obvious leader of N.S.W. Labor-party (“ was ”
for I doubt he believes it now). And I recalled
the episode of. the journey to Melbourne, and of
the Strange Woman ; I recalled also somebody’s
statement of his most affectionate and devoted'
sonship (construing into.his own language J. M.
Barrie’s ‘ Margaret Ogilvy ’). I thought of his
male and sturdy Scbtclmess (the dogged character
which I admire, despite its narrow egotism) ; and
gradually I conjured up such a picture of him that
I thought with Kenehn Chillingly in his fight
with Tom Bowles—‘ he has a handsome face ;
’t would be a shame to spoil it.’
Then I dreamed a little, and smoked the last
cigar, and so to bed.
And what of Burns ? I fear Burns must wait—
he was so far away from my mood —so far away.
• * * *
P.S. —This comes of living on the mountains.
Had I stayed in the city. Black would have been
blasted to a certainty. But ‘from the heights,’
as John Boyle O’Reilly sings—
P.P.S. —I wonder if an argument for reducing
the price of season tickets—effective to the Rail-
way Commissioners could be based on the
demonstration that the ideals of our nation would
be raised and its charity widened by daily moun-
taimmigration en masse? If George Black will
in his parliamentary capacity introduce a deputa-
tion to Mr. Oliver, I shall be happy to attend and
read this article.
_ ♦
Writes ‘ Tom Collins ’ —
Re Burns. In confining comment and discussion to the
work, more or less original, of the Scottish Minstrel, a
constructive injustice has been done to the Universal
Poet. If ‘ the poor man,’as he speaks of Burns, ‘always
holds up his head, and regards you with an elated look’
(Prof. Wilson), it is not because he believes his national
bard to be the sole author of a couple of hundred songs,
chiefly amatory or convivial ; there is no great cause for
elation here. But the Scot regards Burns not only with
pride and affection, but with reverence ; and reverence is
not to be won by the reputed authorship of ‘ We’re a’
Noddin’,’ ‘ Hey, the Dusty Miller,’ and other such homely
ditties. Scarcely even by an occasional patriotic hurst,
like ‘Scots Wha Hae,’ or a dozen heart-uiteranoes,
like ‘ Highland Mary.’ It is not because of such
work that Burns has chief honor in raising the
Lowland dialect to the dignity of a language. And
it is neither love for that dialect nor admiration for
‘The Birks of Aberfeldy ’ and ‘Landlady, Count the
Lawin’,’ which gives Burns a front place in the estima-
tion of millions who neither know nor care what the
‘ birks ’ or the ‘ lawin ’ may be. But these ohansons
are not, Burns.
The Burns whom we appreciate and honor lies beyond
the Scbl tish Minstrel. George Black claims for his hero
* strength, directness, vividness, easy certainty, passion,
wit, pathos, and lightness of touch.’ Indisputable ;
but these qualities are reinforced by another, and that
the rarest and most preoious ever bestowed upon, or cul-
tivated by, man. This is the- quality of Moral Sense
-the power w'hioh enables its possessor to see through
traditional usage, early training, and current or-
thodoxy ; perceiving and recognising the, primary
truth thereby hidden from ids contemporaiii s.
Herein—hacked by courage and iritcgriiv—lies the special
endowment of all proph ts, from Is dab to EpicL tues,
from Moses to Marx. Moral Sense paradoxically a
mental quality—is the prophet’s diploma. The clear-
sighted Greeks made ‘prophet’ and ‘poet’ synonymous.
And on this impregnable foundation rests Burns’s title 10
the name of poet. The minstrel is good in his place ; the
poet is better, and the poet’s place is coextensive with
human habitation.
The English, American, or Australian democratic orator
can coin no such pointed expression of his own protest
attaint legal injustice as lie finds furnished to his
hand, in twenty d fferent forms, by. tins century-old poet.
The swagman, looking over Ins last ‘swapping-boob,’
which happens to be Burns’s poems, untie. s several pages
dirtier than the. average (the double-meaning is yours,
not mine), and there finds his own incoherent challenge
voiced with a ole mess and ferce which give value to its
worth. Whereupon he ‘ holds up his head and regards
you with an elated look,’ though his name is Dennis
O’To le, and his late father was lagged, from Bailyhooley
for cutting a fishing rod out of a young plantation. Still,
it appears, Burns’s latest editor persists in viewing him
as‘the most exquisite artist in folk-song the world has
ever seen.’ Also, an ‘artist’ outside the Vernacular.
This is ‘Sweetest Shatespere, Fancy’s child,’ over again.
Given the opportunities afforded by Labor-movements of
the pr< se't day, Burns was the sort of artist who would
be promptly jail-d by very many of his present senti-
mental admin r«.
And thougti professors of religion have so dragged that
noble w ord in’the dirt that one doesn’t like to introduce
it without saving ‘ saving yonr presence,’ it is impossible
to close these remarks without noticing the invaluable
deodorant contributed to Christianity in such work as
‘Holy Willie’s Prayer,’ the ‘Address to the Unco Guid,”
‘ The Kirk’s Alarm,’ &c. The poet’s Moral S use shines
nowhere brighter or steadier than in his life-long battle
with the orthodoxy of his day. Now name another Eng-
lish-speaking citizen who, single-handed, has successfully
gibbeted abuses of such solidity and sanctity, or who has
indicated vital truths so far in advance of his own time ?
This is the province of the Poet proper; this was the
bard’s special commission from Coila, the muse—
Preserve the Dignity of Man
With soul erect;
And trust the Universal Plan
Will all protect.
No one charges clean-steal, vamp, plagiarism, or adapta-
tion along this line. And this is Burns.
Writeß J. A.P. :
Victor Daley, writing on ‘Girls’ Song Games,’ asks,
‘ Shall we ever have an Australian child-literature of song
and story that will supersede the old i ursery favorites,
with their northern color and northern identity? Not
for five hundred years, I think ! ’ Wrong 1 My little
girl (attending a Sydney Slate-school) and her school-
mates trill out this as a game accompaniment:
‘ Johnny and Jane and Jack and Lou,
Butler’s Stairs through Woolloomooloo;
Woolloomooloo, and ’cross the Domain,
Round the Block, and home again 1
Heigh, ho ! tipsy toe,
Give us a kiss, and away we go.’
How’s that?
Writes ‘Vargo’:
Byron (by no means squeamish) on Robert Burns:
‘ Allen has lent me a quantity Of Burns’s unpublished,
and never-to-be-published, letters. They are full of oaths
and obscene songs. What an antithetical mind I—tender-
ness, roughness—delicacy, coarseness—sentiment, sen-
suality-soaring and grovelling, dirtandDeity—all mixed
up in that one compound of inspired clay !’
I have known men, and been friends with some.
And some there have been strong friends to me*
But at times and seasons one tires.of all—
Grieving to tire - for new instincts call,
And new thoughts part us more than a sea:
When you turn for solace, their lips are dumb.
I’ve known many women, and loved a few,
And a few have been kind and have loved me well;
But there always was something unexpressed
W hich none of them knew, or glimpsed, or guessed ;
There is always something you cannot tell
However closely they strain to you.
So when weary of errors and misconcep' ions
I go where the Bush fronts grand to the sky ;
And my small, weak life is merged in tin Whole,
And the sou! of rue’s lost in the general S ul.
And bland airs blow from this hot, tired I
All its worries, and griefs, and pigmy deceptions.
And I lie at rest in the sparse short grasses,
With Space poured round me and Time annulled.
And watch through the flickering trees’ embrasures
Dim greys glide into infinite azures:
In Silence’s lap I’m cradled and lulled,
And vagroni Sound croons peace as she parses.
And the Bush bends closer and holds my hands,
And her noons or her nights yearn low to listen
When I tell her all in her inmost shrine,
And receive absolution for follies o’ mine ;
Her mouth may smile, but her grave eyesglisten
She is my Lo er, and under-lands
'Come to me for wisdom,’ said the mountain ;■
‘ln the valley and the plain
There is Kc owledge dimmed with sorrow in the gait
There is Effort, with its Hope like a fountain ;
There, the chained rebel, Passion ;
Laboring Strength and Fleet ing Fashion )
There, Ambition’s leaping flame,
And the iris-erown of Fame ;
But those gains are dear, forever
Won from loss and pain and fever.
Nature’s gospel never changes;
Every sudden force deranges!
Blind endeavour is not, wise ;
Wisdom enters through the eyes;
And the seer is the knower,
Is the doer and the sower.
‘Come to me for riches,’ said the peak;
‘ I am leafless, cold and calm ;
But the treasures of the lily and the palm—
They are mine to bestow on those who seek ;
I am gift and I am giver
To the verdured fields below,
As the motherhood of snow
Daily gives the new-born river.
As a watcher on a tower,
Listening to the evening hour,
Sees the wandering currents end
Where the moveless waters shine
On the far horizon-line—
All the storied Past is mine ;
All its strange beliefs still clinging;
All its singers and their singing;
All the paths that led away,
All the meteors onoe called Day ;
All the stars that rose to shine—
Come to me—for all are mine 1
‘Come to me for safety,’ said the heights;
‘ln the future as the past,
Road and river end at last
Like a raindrop in the ever-circling sea.
Who shall know by lessened sight
Where the gain and where the loss
In the desert they must cross ?
Guides who lead their charge from ills,
Passing soon from town to town,
Through the forest and the down,
Take direction from the hills.
Those who range a wider land,
Higher climb until they stand
Where the past and future swing
Like a far blue ocean-ring.
Those who sail from lands afar
Leap from mountain-top to star ;
Higher still, from star to God,
Have the spirit-pilots trod,
Setting lights for mind and Soul
That the ships may reach the goal.
‘ They shall safely steer who see ;
Sight is wisdom. Come to me ! ’

Do you desire to be the
Equal of your Fellow-man ?
A man likes to feel so strong-, so full of pent-up vitality
that he could cope with anything that comes before' him.
He likes to know that when he is put to the test in a
matter of manly power he is equal to the demand. It is
the commendable desire of every man to be the equal of
his fellow-man.
This strength is simply one element; it is not alone
muscular power, nerve power nor mental strength. It
combines all in one. It is vital force—the foundation of
all human power, it is the element of all organic, nerve,
muscular and mental energy. Men who are lacking in
this element can recover it. They can be strong, as many
other men have been and are." They can renew their
vital energies with my treatment.
There are so many grateful men who speak
of Surgeon Langston’s success, that it is not necessary
any more to give names of people cured, but hundreds
of them, and some very valuable Information on
the subject, can be found in the little book, “ Mens Sana
in Corporb Sano.” Get it. Free on application, or by
mail (sealed), six stamps.
Are you Robbed of Manhood
by Youthful Folly?
Read what former sufferers have to say, and remember
that I positively guarantee to cure all forms of Debility,
Shrunken Parts, Nervousness, Confusion of Ideas, Lan-
guor, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism, Kidney and Bladder Com-
plaints, Varicocele, Blood and Skin Diseases, and the
many evils resulting from secret habits in youth or
excesses in maturer years.
CONSULTATION is free to all, but where £1 is
enclosed a careful diagnosis of the case will be made, and
appropriate medicines sent. Before confiding your case
elsewhere, consult the old and successful Specialist
SURGEON LANGSTON. A friendly letter or call may
save future suffering. New edition of my latest work,
“ Mens Sana in Corpore Sano,” nearly 100 pages, sent free
to men. N.B. —The only Qualified Surgeon practising as
a Specialist who has held Government Appointments.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Heame’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Agb of your * Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria."
“ After suffering from Asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cured me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Heame’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power. ” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 69
other leading residents.

prietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria.

others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.’*

Various Verses.
The alleged Schenk discovery is being
taken very seriously in Austria, where many
estates are in danger for want of male heirs. One
special case in which Schenk claims by his treat
ment to have retained an enormous property in
the family is considered to be that of the Arch
duke Frederick, whose -£10,000,000 were in dangei
until, after bearing eight successive daughters,
the Archduchess, in her 41st year, produced a
son and saved the shekels.
THE MOTHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lo ! My little child was dead.
Sad, yet calm, the salt tears fell;
For I knew the God who smote
Loved him ; with my child ’twas well.
In the grave they laid him low;
But my eyes were raised to Heaven,
And I smiled to know him there,
With the sinless and forgiven.
Then the cruel rain came down,
Beat upon the little sod,
Did not spare my child at all— ■
That was why I turned from God.
CONSTANCE CLYDE.
HIS ONLY IDYLL.
Lived a life of barren torpor, capped by common-
place success;
Died respected, and was standing at the door to
blessedness.
And he knocked, whereat the angel, who was
guardian of the gate,
Quickly came to look him over ere pronouncing on
his fate.
“ You may enter, but,” he thundered, “in your
luggage here I see
You are smuggling into Heaven contraband of
memory ! ”
Then the guilty, white-haired mortal humbly,
with a wistful face,
Pleaded for a seat in heaven, pleaded for a quiet
place:
“ I have left my goods and chattels to the poor
and lame and blind ;
Left my hope and my ambition, even left my
name behind.
What I was on yonder planet, how I fought and
won at last,
Is forgotten and has vanished in the shadows of
_ the past;
Pain and pleasure, pride and glory, none has fol-
lowed here above,
Only this, a faint remembrance of the fleeting
touch of love.
Leave me then a tiny token of a moment’s earthly
bliss,
Just the ghost of what has happened, of a May
day and a kiss ! ”
But the angel would not listen : “ Holy is the joy
within ;
Do not hope to pass the portal in the company of
sin.
She, who once in godless passion made herself
your very own,
Has repented, long repented, and is singing at the
Throne.
She is here, and clad in Virtue—you shall meet her,
good and pure ;
Come, forget and be forgiven ; enter, and the
Lord will cure.”
But the mortal.stood and pondered, then he sadly
turned away :
“ No ; rriy paradise is outside, with that memory
of May.
I am happy in my dreamland, short romance of
joy and pain,
It would only spoil the vision if I met the girl
again. '
She is doubtless sweet and holy, but my dream is
sweeter, sir,
And I meant to keep it living, or—l would have
married her ! ”
VON KOTZE.
LOVERS AND LIVERS.
The heart, through countless ages
Of love-dreams bright and youthful,
On the evidence of sages
Who were honestly untruthful,
Has been credited with forces
Always recognised as mighty
Both in marriage, and divorces,
’Twixt the virtuous, or flighty.
Edwin buys a heart-shaped token
To adorn his Angy’s bosom ;
And we say that hearts are broken
When we jilt our girls, or lose ’em ;
But, a truce to foolish chatter
Touching shafts from Cupid’s quiver—
Love is just a little matter
That depends upon the liver.
A more than common liking,
An attachment strong and chronic.
Oft is brought about by biking,
Or a dose of patent tonic.
Most courtships have been noted
For inexplicable pauses,
And couples, quite devoted,
“ Break it off ” from hidden causes,
And delight in their dejection,
Reaping sorrow where they sow it;
But the main-spring of affection
Isn’t mentioned by the poet.
Though a heart go pitter-patter,
Though a soul may seem to shiver,
Love is just a little matter
That depends upon the liver.
The golden heart-shaped locket
Is a sentimental fiction,
And its price, in Angy’s pocket,
Would impart as much conviction
That her suitor speaketh truly
When he vows to love her ever;
Yet the tongue is so unruly
One can never trust it, never 1
Edwin’s talk, at times delightful,
Is more often supercilious,
Whilst Angy’s temper’s frightful
If she happen to be bilious.
They may fight, or smile and flatter,
As they stroll beside the river—
Love is just a little matter
That depends upon the liver.

The Wesleyan Conference yesterday passed
a resolution urging all Methodist people to
observe the Sabbath, and to abstain from un-
necessary travelling on that day.”
It has been noticed during the last few weeks
that the majority of thefts from dwellings which

The Industrial Endowment Delusion.
There are in Australia three offices which
make a special feature of Industrial Life As-
surance. This is the kind which is brought
round retail to the purchaser’s back door
instead of being sold wholesale at the office.
The companies which go in for it have an
immense number of clients, who pay from
Id. up to Is. or more per week for a micro-
scopic benefit payable in the very far here-
after—if nothing goes wrong meanwhile.
The size of the business may be guessed at
from the fact that one of the three—the Citi-
zens’ co. of Sydney—claims to have issued
nearly 79,000 new policies last year. The
plea always advanced on behalf of the Indus-
trial business is that it. makes assurance
possible for the poorest class of the
community, which could never save enough
to pay a quarterly or half-yearly or annual
premium, but which contrives somehow or
other to stint itself of the few coppers that
are required every week to keep the In-
dustrial racket going. This is one way of
putting it ; the other way is that the In-
dustrial business is a handy way of preying
on the poorest and most ignorant class which
doesn’t know any better.
* * * *
It is a hideously expensive process to begin
with. The Industrial Assurance concern
hires dozens of persons to tramp over the
cities and towns of Australasia all day and
every day collecting pennies and small silver
subscriptions. Naturally the salaries of all
these persons eat up an enormous propor-
tion of the income. The Citizens co., last
year, spent more than half—a good deal
more than half—of its industrial premiums
in expenses. The Australasian Temper-
ance and General Society, last year,
made a rather unusual effort to boom
its business, and got, a considerable
amount of new industrial assurance, and
spent £14,700 in expenses alone to
get in £ll,BOO in premiums. In other words,
all the premiums and a lot more besides went
in expenses. This sort of thing, of course,
doesn’t happen with the Temperance and
General as a regular thing, but the fact that
it can happen even once is sufficiently awful.
A third office in the same line of business —
the Provident and Industrial co. of Maori-
land—last year spent, so far as appears from
the rather confused accounts, all its premiums
in expenses. In fact, this truly dreadful
concern seems regularly to spend, in claims
and expenses, more than its entire premiums,
and its state looks very like one of utter in-
solvency. But, apart from any question of
insolvency, the huge expense-rate naturally
makes it necessary to give a miserably small
amount of life assurance for the money, and
makes the Industrial business something very
much akin to robbery without violence.
♦ * * *
The writer has before him the Industrial
Endowment rates of the two more respect-
able offices—the Citizens’andthe Australasian
Temperance and General. In each case a
child of five may be insured, at 6d. a week,
for £24, payable at age 21. This means pay-
ing 6d. a week, or £1 6s. per annum, for 16
years. If the same amount was deposited in
the savings bank, even at only 3 per cent,
interest, and with vastly better security, it
would amount, in the same number of years,
to about £26. The two cases are exactly
parallel, because the industrial policy is not
(like the endowment policies issued by ordi-
nary life offices) payable at age 21, or at
death, if the insured dies before 21. The in-
dustrial co. simply says that, if the 6d. a
week is paid regularly for 16 years, and the
company keeps afloat and remains solvent,
and if the person whose name appears on
the policy doesn’t die in the interval, it will
pay £24. The Commissioners’ Savings Bank
gives much better security, that, at the end
of the same period, for the same payment, it
will return about £26, no matter who dies in
the interval.
♦ * * •
Supposing, however, the insured dies
before the 16 years have expired, the insur-
ance is not payable, but these two companies
agree to return the premiums they have
received, without interest. Say the person
had been insured for 15 years at 6d. a week,
the co. would return £l9 10s. If the same
6d. a week had been deposited in the
Savings Bank for 15 years that institution
would return about £24 ; so the industrial
assurance racket gives less money and less
security as well. Also, there are other draw-
backs about the office which collects the
small coin irregularly at the back door. It
is a general condition that if the 6d. a week
is a certain number of weeks in arrear the
policy is lapsed, and the co. can repudiate
all liability and forfeit all the money already
paid. It is always liable to happen that the
payments are in arrear simply because the
collector hasn’t arrived up to time, and prob-
ably many persons are really unaware
whether their policies are in force or not at
any given date. Numbers of people prob-
ably pay in a spasmodic fashion, and
their policies are in a state of lapse, and
their claims on the society are nil, a great
part of the time. If the same individual put
his small subscription in the Savings Bank,
that institution never dreams of forfeiting
the amount already deposited because the
new deposits are not made at any regular
date.
• * * *
In either the Citizens’ or the Temperance
and General offices the endowment insurer,
if he ceases his payments after, say, years,
has no claim for the return of anything.
The office reserves the right to simply
annex his £4 11s. y whereas the Savings Bank
would hand it back with interest. If he has
been insured for four complete years, how-
ever, and is unable to pay any more, the
Industrial Assurance office, in return for his
£5 45., will give him, not his money back,
but a policy for £6, payable in 12 years—if
the assured is still alive then. If the person
assured dies in the interval, the £5 4s. is
apparently returned on death. The Savings
Bank would give about £7 10s. at the end of
12 years, or it would return the money im-
mediately if requested. Also, it gives vastly
better security for the payment of its £7los.
than any mere private institution can give
for the £6.
* * • •
The Provident and Industrial of Maoriland
goes on a slightly different plan. If a child
of five is insured under the endowment plan
at 6d. per week, this co. agrees to pay at
age 21—or 16 years from the date of the
policy—£26 ss. The Savings Bank, even if
it gave only 3 per cent, interest, would pan
out for about the same amount—the differ-
ence being that in one case the payment is
guaranteed by one of the biggest and most
solvent and most carefully supervised public
institutions in the Seven Provinces, and in
the other by about the smallest and most
utterly hopeless-looking private assurance
concern in all Australasia. If the person
assured dies before the 16 years are expired
the Provident and Industrial has the magni-
ficent effrontery to return only three-four hs of
the premiums without interest. In other words,
if the 6d. a week has been paid regularly
for 14 years, and the co. has received £lB 4s.
it will hand back £l3 13s. The Savings
Bank, if it had received the same amount by
like instalments, would hand back over £22,
including interest. And. in addition to this,
there is the further risk attached to the
insurance co. that the policy is liable to
lapse at any time and all the money paid to
be forfeited, merely through an accidental
neglect to pay one or two premiums.
If the insured, after paying for, perhaps,
three years eleven months, can’t keep up
the instalments, all the money paid is for-
feited. The co. could often, if it pleased, bring
about forfeiture when the time of payment
was nearly due, by the simple process of
ceasing to call for the money until the pay-
ments had got far enough in arrear to make
the policy invalid —it is expressly stipulated
by the Provident and Industrial that “in
no case will omission to call he allowed as an
excuse for non-payment of the premiums at
the proper time.” Also, in the case of
children’s endowments, which are a very
large part of industrial business, the Provi-
dent doesn't seem to say definitely that, if a
person has paid up £5 4s. in instalments
spread over four years, and then can’t pay
any more, it will even give its written pro-
mise to pay £6 twelve years ahead as an
equivalent.
* * ft *
This article deals with one branch only of
the Industrial Assurance business ; there
isn’t enough space in a moderate-sized paper
to show the utter unprofitableness of the
same kind of assurance in all its other forms.
In The Bulletin’s opinion the notable
features of Industrial Assurance are these :
It manages to exist because it is practised
by a poor and ignorant class who, in 999
cases out of 1000, never attempt to figure
out the real inwardness of the ghastly sham.
It provides good billets for many managers,
directors and others, and exists mainly for
their benefit. And, where it doesn't exist
wholly for the benefit of the managers and
directors, it exists to make dividends for
private shareholders, and to find work for
the great army of seedy non-producers who
collect the weary, weekly 6d. at the back-
doors of the people who don’t know any
better.
A Boom Wanted.
A recent announcement by Minister Best that
the Victorian Government intended to inaugu-
rate a “ bold, progressive public works policy ”
is evidence that the continued girding of David
Syme has at last produced some result. Some
months ago David the Stupendous came down
suddenly in the Age with his ukase that the
Turner Ministry was to “go it.” It was a
favorable time to float a big loan in London,
said David, and the country, David said, was
being starved for want of public works, and the
policy of economy, in the opinion of David,
was being carried too far. There was an
undertone of menace in the article which inti-
mated that if the Turner Ministry didn’t “ go
it” DAViDSYMEmightfeel called upon to whistle
to his menial downstairs to send up a new
Ministry which would. Ever since then the
Age has been the voice of one with a strong
Scotch accent crying in the wilderness for the
Turner Government to “ go it,” and the under-
tone of menace to the effect that David Syme
might get measured for a new Government
at any moment, was always present. And now
it would seem that the Ministry is going to try
to boom a little, anyhow, in order to keep its
billet.
• * * »
Victoria does want a “ bold, progressive
policy ” ; about that there can be no possible
doubt whatever. It is about four times as
thickly peopled as New South Wales, and
it isn’t likely to hold many more people
for a long while unless the half of the
province which is now practically inacces-
sible is opened up. It wants roads and rail-
ways to make Eastern Gippsland habitable. It
wants roads, railways, and, above all, large
irrigation works to make the western plains
fit for occupation. The only question is whether
they should be paid for with borrowed money,
or out of revenue. The habit of paying for
almost every kind of public work out of bor-
rowed money is so ingrained in the Australian
soul that almost everybody takes the former
alternative for granted. When the great Syme
organ first issued instructions to the Turner
Government to go it, the ukase was accom-
panied, as a matter of course, with the remark
that the present was a favourable time for
floating a loan in London. The idea of doing
anything without the inevitable loan curse was
so unprecedented as not to be worth mentioning.
* * * *
Australasia has already the biggest debt on
earth in proportion to population. The wheeze
which every politician has got by heart on this
subject is that the debt doesn’t matter because
it was incurred for “reproductive works.”
This is partly true, and very largely a lie.
The Seven Provinces owe, roughly speaking,
£55,000,000 for works that are not reproductive
in any sense. The entire public debt of Great
Britain, for which there are no reproductive
assets to show, runs to about £l5 per inhabi-
tant. That part of the debt of Australasia for
which there are no reproductive assets to show
equals £l3 per inhabitant all round, and by
reason of the heavier rate of interest, this £l3
is quite as heavy a burden as Britain’s £l5.
It took Britain 200 years to get to this
pass ; Australasia has got into an equally
disastrous situation in 40 years. Britain got
there because it had enormous sums going out
for war expenses, over and above its ordinary
expenditure. Australia had no such outlay,
but it had immense sums coming in by way of
land revenue over and above its ordinary in-
come. And all this is taking no account of the
borrowings for railways, tramways, water-
works, sewerage, telegraphs and telephones,
and anything else of a reproductive character ;
even though hardly any of these undertakings
pay interest on their cost, yet so long as they
pay cmythinri towards interest, they are left out
of the above calculation. But merely through
charging to loans all manner of casual, unre-
productive works wdiich should have been de-
bited to current revenue these provinces, with
their magnificent land revenues, with no wars
(save a little native trouble in Maoriland), and
with practically nq navy and very little army
to maintain, have gone almost as deep in debt
in 40 years as Britain, with all its wars, with
its huge naval and military expenditure, and
with no vast land revenues to reduce the burden
of taxation, has done in 200 years. And
Britain is steadily reducing its debt. These
provinces are increasing theirs.
* * * *
Victoria has, undoubtedly, spent far less
loan money on wholly uureproductive works
than any other of the Seven Provinces. But
by spending large sums on works which were
only slightly productive it has got there just
the same. Victoria has to raise about £600,000
a year by taxation to pay that part of the
interest on its public debt which the income
from its “ reproductive works ” fails to cover.
That is about 10s. per inhabitant per annum.
The British public debt costs about 11s. per
inhabitant per annum, so even Victoria, the
least-burdened province of the seven, has built
up almost as heavy an unproductive load in
40 years of peace as Britain did in 200 years of
war.
* * * *
Another reason assigned .ad nauseam .why
Australasia should keep on raising loans is that
the money “ develops the resources of the
country.” Sometimes it does. Bub every
civilised country is developing its resources all
the time, and will keep on doing so all the
time, and there is no earthly reason why Aus-
tralasia should be the one country on earth
which can’t develop anything without borrow-
ing. Moreover, an enormous amount of the
borrowed money doesn’t develop anything.
Another reason assigned is that when a pro-
vince suddenly stops borrowing, as Victoria
has done, the increase of population is violently
checked. Naturally it is. When the Vic-
torian boom was at its worst, some ten years
ago, about one-tenth of the population lived
on wages paid out of borrowed money. When
their borrowed bread and cheese suddenly
stopped other industries couldn’t find
immediate employment for this immense
mass of population, and many shifted to other
provinces where the gorgeous borrowing policy
was still going on. Yet another reason (ad-
vanced by the Agk) why Victoria should go
making some more debts, is that it has bor-
rowed so much less than N.S. W. that each
inhabitant pays 4s. less per annum in interest.
This is held to mean that Victoria can safely gO
further in debt till the extra interest absorbs
the said 4s. pet annum. An equally logical
view is that Victoria could stand 4s. per
annum extra taxation, in order to raise
£220,000 a year out of revenue for new public
works, and thus not go further in debt. To any
community which hasn’t got the loan complaint
in its worst form it seems quite as easy to pay
£220,000 a year towards new works as to pay
the same amount in interest on the awful dead
horse of an old debt.
* » • *
Allowing for the fact that some public
works yield no return at all, and that most
of them don’t pay full interest on the loan
money with which they are constructed,
a return of 2 per cent, is about all that
can be reasonably expected. The loan money
costs fully 3 per cent. On this basis a province
which borrows even £500,000 a year for public
works adds £5OOO every year to its taxa-
tion, and at the end of 20 years it will be pay-
ing £lOO,OOO a year in perpetuity as the price
of its little boom. The same province, if it
raised £500,000 a year extra revenue, and built
the same works therewith, would add £lO,OOO
every year to its revenue, and in 20 years would
have £200,000 a year coming in instead of
£lOO,OOO ayeargo i n g out. This is a vast difference,
and any Government which is under orders from
its Caledonian tyrant to go it may well con-
sider the point. Victoria has nearly £2,000,000
more gold on hand than N.S. Wales, which
shows that the money with which to pay more
taxes is available. And there are plenty of
devices for raising the money if the Turner
Government likes to try the experiment of
creating a Public Works Fund, and setting
aside certain special sources of revenue to keep
it supplied.
* * * •
The common plea in this matter is that the
country is poor and can’t stand more taxation.
Yet these provinces are lightly taxed on the
whole in proportion to many other countries.
They claim also to be about the wealthiest com-
munities on earth, and consequently the best
able to stand taxation. In any case, they can
stand taxation quite as well to build railways
and irrigation works as to pay interest to Bull
on the money borrowed to build railways and
irrigation works. And taxation, when the
money is profitably employed in the country,
makes it richer instead of poorer ; the money
remains in the country, though it may have
changed hands, and the works which were con-
structed with it are there also, and where there
is now £500,000 in gold there would be then
£500,000 in gold and £500,000 of valuable
public works as well. Hitherto, when Aus-
tralia has made a special effort in the way ot
taxation, it has always been to send the money
out of the country by way of paying interest to
Bull —interest on the old, weary, dead horse
which being dead is still immortal—and that is
quite another thing. The experiment which
The Bulletin advocates has never been trie
yet. The public works boom which was made
out of revenue would not be liable to ®
sudden and disastrous stoppages, and the awlu
depressions, and dreadful recoveries which
characterise the loan boom. And £500,006
year raised by taxation and spent in the cowwhy
on reproductive works would not only add
£500,000 every year to the aggregate wealtn
(because at the end of each year the money
would still be in the country and the new
works also), but it would likewise add about
another £lO,OOO every year to the State income
in the shape of receipts from these works, an<
in the meantime it would supply work and
wages to about 3000 able-bodied men represent-
ing, with their families, about 15,000 people
The Bulletin believes in having a great boom

idea of how to start one.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Federal Capital.
The partial settlement which has been arrived
at re the Federal Capital should give Australia
a rest from the gruesome maunderings of A. G.
Taylor about the alleged agreement —which
that long and brassy gentleman says is already
cut-and-dried—to make Melbourne the capital
of the Commonwealth, and thus leave Sydney
a mere dead provincial town, bleaching on the
shores of the river of Time. A new clause in
the Constitution, proposed by Premier Turner
of Victoria, provides that the capital is to be
Federal territory, and this agreement shuts out
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide equally from
any chance of being the Federal city. The
place selected as the centre of the Common-
wealth will be absolutely severed from the pro-
vince to which it now belongs. If Victoria
surrendered its one big city, what remained
would be a mere second-rate province, with
700,000 people—very little more influential than
S.A. or Queensland —and with hardly enough
voting power in the Commonwealth Parliament
to make itself heard. If N.S.W. gave Sydney
over to the Commonwealth as a Federal terri-
tory, the N.S.W. that was left would be a
secondary province of far less population and
voting power than Victoria, and with a coaly
little capital at Newcastle. If S.A. handed
over Adelaide, it would reduce itself to about
the rank of Tasmania. Therefore this agree-
ment, if the Convention has sense enough to
adhere to it, ends the gory conflict among the
existing capital cities. And it is well that it
does; the idea of having the Federal city on
the sea-coast, convenient to all enemies who
may come along, and having a Federal and a Pro-
vincial Government in one city, and of having a
Central Government with no home of its own, but
lodging on sufferance in the house of one of its
subordinate States, was utterly foolish and
impracticable. The new agreement was not
arrived at, however, without another desperate
and unseemly grab on the part of the N.S.W.
delegates, five of whom, including Premier
Reid, voted for fixing the capital irrevocably
at Sydney. Tasmania, S.A., and Westralia
made no grab at all. A proposal to fix the
capital in Melbourne was only supported by
one Victorian delegate, Peacock of the Fearful
Laugh ; therefore the Southerners can at least
say that they reached out far less vociferously
for the loot than their Cornstalk neighbors.
The proposal to make the capital Federal terri-
tory, and thus disqualify all the existing capi-
tals equally, was supported by nine Victorians
and only five N.S.W. delegates—the other five
hanging on grimly to the last to their claim
that Sydney, and no other place, should be the
seat of Government. The fact that the vast
majority of the South Australians and Vic-
torians voted thus solidly, and that only one
Victorian voted for Melbourne as the seat of
Government, at least gives the lie to the alleged
“ conspiracy ” to make the Yarra-bank city the
political centre of Australia. But the fact that,
of all the five delegations, that of N.S.W. was
the only one that clawed to the very last for
•■he ownership of the Federal city, and that
N.S.W. is also the only province where a loud
and brazen provincial party has systematically
denounced Federation as a conspiracy on the
part of the other provinces to get the Federal
city, is a very curious combination.
Civil Service Employment.
Editor Bulletin.—The dignity of a calling is
the exact measure of its'' estimation in the
public mind—an estimation that rests largely,
if not altogether, on the public need of its
ministrations. Nevertheless, although the
whole machinery of life would come to an
abrupt standstill with the cessation of the
labors of the Civil Service of any country, the
Service itself (in Australasia) occupies a
lower standard of estimation in the public
mind than does the most unskilled branch of
unskilled, labor. The cause is not far to seek.
In a democracy in which government of the
people, by the people, for the people, has be-
come a petrified shibboleth of office-seekers, the
class whose position appears to be even
momentarily assured becomes the immediate
target of attack. The Civil Service is
there—and it is always there. It is
popular to attack it, to retrench it, to dis-
miss it. The civil servant is alleged to be
somewhat superiorly educated. He wears a
coat in office hours, and his hire is called
“ salary,” and not “wages.” Moreover, he is
paid once a month ; consequently the working
man hates him most cordially. The poor
wretch has no certitude of continuity of em-
ployment. A change of Government means to
him a fresh alarm. Dismissal spells to him
starvation, for no decent firm would employ a
man whose service has compelled him to be
“servile,” and oppressively “sir’’-vile—not
“civil.” Retrenchment is always popular, for
it is such an easy method of adjusting
revenue to expenditure, and often obviates
the imposition of fresh taxation. Then, too.
Democracy is a blind fool. It thinks to serve
the cause of labor by degrading what it con-
siders to be a privileged form of labor. It
seeks to drag down the status of the Govern-
ment as an employer of labor to that of the
worst type of the employer of labor in the open
market. Its true democratic course would be
to maintain the status of Government in this
connection, as a standard of possible attainment
by all outside employment of labor. There is
no immunity from continuous attack, therefore
the Civil Service is inefficient and ill-manned.
The best men in the community are frightened
of it. Democracy cannot be run on “ busi-
ness ” lines (which mean buying labor, and
other things, in the cheapest market and
selling in the dearest) ; Democracy must be
run on socialistic lines—lines that tend to
the social advancement of the whole com-
munity, with the Government as
its brightest type. What sort of a poor, cor-
rupt creature would a judge be were he amen-
able to the regulations of a Public Service
Board? Hey! Again, what kind pf rank-and-
file efficiency can yon expect from a Civil
Service, the highest prize in which is £lOOO per
annum ? The trembling wretch who enters, with
a petition for an advance in his “screw,” the
board-room of the N.S. W. triumvirate sees in his
mind’s eye the gruesome legend over the portal
“ .£lOOO per annum.” In the ordinary course
of human nature, the cheap chief of the service
could surely never admit a value for service
distantly approximating his own; the gulf
which induces respect —and servility—must be
maintained at all hazards. The English civil
servant has a dignified position in public life,
mainly because it is under the aegis of the aris-
tocracy, whose younger sons must be pro-
vided for. There, truly, patronage is a power,
but it is a patronage seldom exercised on behalf
of incompetency. There examinations of a
preliminary nature must be passed before a
candidate is admitted to nomination, and the
examinations are severer than our own. The
report of the Public Service Board of N.S.
Wales seems to indicate the utter incompetence
of the entire Civil Service. Considering the
universal incompetence, is it wonderful how
vacancies, which have from time to time
occurred on the Board itself, were so readily
filled by the discredited and worn-out chiefs
of various departments. The Board should
be placed absolutely outside Parliamen-
tary interference. The members should be
permanent, and they should be paid the
amount earned by a first-class man in any
outside liberal profession, say some £2500 or
£3OOO per annum. If the Governors of the
Service are worth to the State only £lOOO a
year what would they earn in a private capa-
city, and what are their under-strappers worth?
Emphatically, no vacancy on the Board should
be capable of being filled at a moment’s notice
on the nod of a Minister. It is the Acting-
Judge iniquity in another form.— Publico.
*.
The New Fateh on the Old Garment.
In The Bulletin’s opinion there is no process
by which a nominee Legislative Council can be
gradually reformed and brought into demo-
cratic ways. The only thing to be done with
it is to wipe out the nominee principle utterly,
and clear out the old nominees in one lot, and
start afresh. In Maoriland Ballance began a
gradual reform by appointing all new members
for a seven-year term and leaving the old life
members to die out through old age and the
accumulation of barnacles upon them. The
scheme hasn’t panned out' any too well ; the
first batch of seven-year nominees are already
beginning to vote the Tory ticket and to talk
the Tory shibboleths. In N.S.W. ten demo-
crats were sent to the Council barely three
years ago, and already, according to the man
who sent them, they are growing unrecognis-
able. And it is quite natural that they should.
Before they went to the Upper House they, in
common with most other progressive poli-
ticians, usually called their present colleagues
old, dull-headed fossils of the most lamentable
kind. After they went there the majority of
the Upper House still consisted of the same
fossils, and the same term of contempt remained
in use. To the public an M.L.C. was still an
ancient wooden person with no brains and
much bingey. By-and-bye the old terms of
reproach begin to irritate the new democratic
M.L.C. It is one thing to stand outside and
say, quite truly, that the average M.L.C. is a
pompous ass; it is quite another thing to
stand inside and be one of the asses,
and hear the fellow outside say the same
thing. In course of time the new M.L.C. gets
a great deal madder at the democrat outside
than at the fossil inside, and joins the fossils.
The same thing always happens under the same
conditions. When the first English conquerors
settled in Ireland, they regarded the local kern
as something beneath contempt and too low for
derision. But the Englishman in England
went on calling the residents of Ireland slaves
and hogs and other things, and the Englishman
in Ireland found himself included in the ana-
thema simply because the other fellow never
took time to discriminate, and he ended by
throwing in his lot with the native and be-
coming more Irish than the real Irishman.
A dozen different waves of English settlers
poured into Ireland, and the mere handful
of real Irishmen absorbed almost all of them.
And in the same way, a reforming Govern-
ment may send up one batch after another of
new democrats to a Tory Council, and the old
original Tories may in course of time disappear
utterly, but so long as the reform begins by
adding a patch on to the old. garment, instead
of burning the old garment altogether, very
little permanent good will result. The new
men inherit the bad name of the old institution,
and that creates a gulf between them and their
fellow democrats outside. They are not paid,
in N.S.W. at all events, like the M’sL.A.,
which is practically telling them that they are
not worth payment. Their powers are strictly
limited as compared with those of the Assembly,
and when the best democrat is appointed to a
legislative billet with the intimation from his
fellow democrats that he isn’t worth any
salary and that he needs to be strictly
tied up as a suspicious character, he soon
feels a desire to kick those other demo-
crats. He is also told that he must
avoid all interference with financial matters,
because he hasn’t the necessary brains and
honesty, and he doesn’t possess the popular
confidence—in short, he is an unpaid legislative
leper, and he presently grows angry enough to
behave like one. Just by way of an experiment
The Bulletin would like to see John Norton
created an M.L.C. ; and if, after he had been
told a few dozen times by the democrats out-
side that M’s.L.C. were an ancient, stupid,
dunderheaded race, he didn’t rally up the aged
senators to deal out stoush to all and sundi",
and to chuck out everything that came in thei 1
way, he wouldn’t be the fighting John tins
paper takes him for.
Vice-Regal Chief Justices.
Australia, thus far, has had one Federal
system of Government. All the provinces have
been satisfied to sanction the immoral practice
of appointing a Chief dustiee to act as poli-
tical-social figurehead when the ordinary
vice-reeal person was not available for
duty. Governors in Australia, as we are often
reminded by newspaper writers here and at
’Ome, serve mainly to represent the Queen in
an inner social circle, and dispense hospitality
to a chosen few. His Excellency’s wife is a
more important influence in Government House
politics than her husband, we are told. The
vice-regal establishment is supported by the
community at large for the particular benefit of
Sassiety, with a capital S, whose members are
expected to court the friendship of the reign-
ing family. When a Chief Justice is sworn
in as Deputy-Governor he puts himself
on terms of intimacy with the moneyed class,
and the other Judges, who mostly rally round
their chief in his entertaining character, join
with him in a highly improper sacrifice of
the Bench’s claim to impartiality. The law
lays itself open to be “ nobbled ” by the Nicest
people, and in a great measure it is “ nobbled.”
To any furious admirer of the administration of
English justice all the world over The Bulle-
tin can only say that Judges in Great Britain
live less exposed lives than their Austra-
lian brethren. Eor indirect proof of which
fact search the London society scriptures.
Judges in Great Britain confine themselves
almost entirely within a legal, professional
circle, and when called upon to weigh criminal
evidence against a member of Parliament, or a
high-toned personage of any sort of distinction,
they can do so in a calm, judicial spirit. The
case of Lord William Nevill provides a useful
object lesson in the difference between the re-
spective environments of British and Austra-
lian Judges. The prisoner pleaded guilty
in the Court of Queen’s Bench, to a charge
of obtaining money by fraud, and he
was sentenced right away to five years’
penal servitude. The same Lord Nevill might
have performed the same crime in Mel-
bourne, where he was quartered in days
of yore, and nobody can positively affirm that
he wouldn’t have come to the same or worse
grief at the bidding of, say, Chief Justice
Madden. Nevertheless it is positively certain
that Madden, the occasional Acting-Governor,
couldn’t avoid the consciousness of a Govern-
ment House intimacy with the titled swindler.
Should a Judge be tempted into close society
contact with the ruling class which, under any
circumstances, must always be a somew’hat
favored class? Or should he live up to his pro-
fessional character by striving to be as unap-
proachable off the Bench as he is whilst up-
holding the dignity of his wig ?
Yet another more or less Suffield case. On
July 13, 1897, a young woman named Hughes
alleged that she had been assaulted and robbed
at Rhyl, North Wales. Upon complaint to the
police the latter produced photos, of men and
youths who had been previously in custody.
The woman promptly identified the photo, of
one Walter Spriggs, who had been previously
convicted of a petty offence. Spriggs was
arrested in London, and at his trial five wit-
nesses swore that they had seen Spriggs in the
neighborhood on the day of the assault. For
the defence 12 witnesses testified that on that
day the accused was with his parents at Forest
Gate, hundreds of miles distant. Justice
Grantham, who tried the case, summed up
dead against Spriggs and observed that the
alibi set up on behalf of the accused was alto-
gether too perfect and too artistic, and he went
on to remark that these witnesses had come
into court dressed in a manner above their
station in life. (Also, perhaps, they shuffled
their feet in the box.) How the five witnesses for
the prosecution were dressed did not transpire.
The Judge also abandoned all precedent by
referring to the prisoner’s previous conviction in
his summing-up, thus influencing the jury against
the prisoner. The jury found Spriggs guilty,
and he received a sentence of five years. Sub-
sequently the case was taken up by Mr. Yel-
verton, a London barrister, and Home Secre-
tary Ridley was induced to put it in the
hands of the Criminal Investigation Depart-
ment for further inquiry. The evidence of the
defence witnesses was not only confirmed but
further supported and Spriggs was released,
after serving two months of his sentence, upon
a “special license,” and has been promised a
“ free pardon.” This latter idea of giving a
pardon to a man for an offence he never com-
mitted is the only humorous incident in the
case.
♦
Melb.’s gilded Mayor, Malcolm MacEacharn,
who is David Syme’s latest white-haired boy,
headed a deputation, the ether day, to the
authorities of the enfeebled Vic. Postal Depart-
ment, to demand that another cable connecting
with the dear old Motherland should be con-
structed. Malcolm Mac. urged as a reason
that, only a few days before, he had perforce
let a ship go uninsured for a fortnight, and had
also lost the sale of a shipment of wheat on ac-
count of cable-breaks. A dual or absolutely
reliable cable-system evidently means tons of
money for the big Melb. merchants. Why,
then, don’t millionaire Malcolm Mac. and his
club pals, to whom the deadsure connection
with ’Ome means so much, put up a few thou-
sands apiece as a subsidy to induce the accursed
Government to do this thing? It is “a bit
thick ” to expect the working taxpayer to pro-
vide speculators and wealthy business houses
with such a costly toy as a second cable. To the
common halfpenny-Australian, whose messages
to England are neither lengthy, nor frequent, the
present service is sufficient. He wouldn’t even
reap any advantage from another line in the
shape of additional world-wide news in the
dailies, for the syndicate now deals out even-
handed non-competitive slush to all alike. And,
as for the war argument, it may safely be
assumed that Bull’s enemies, on an outbreak of
hostilities, unless they perish suddenly by the
wrath of a righteous God, will cut that girdle
wherever it may lie in the sea.
When it was proposed in the Federal Conven-
tion that the railways, under Commonwealth
management, should charge uniform rates by
distance, the loudest lament from the N.S.W.
side was that the cut-rates were necessary for
“the development of the country.” Which
seems a little thin, somehow. As an instance,
Berrigan, in Riverine, can send its wheat to
Melbourne (about 180 miles) for about lbs. per
ton. It can also send it. to Sydney (+34 miles)
for 16s. per ton. N.S.W. loses several shil-
lings per ton on the transaction. It doesn’t
develop Berrigan worth a cent., for the Melb.
line had already developed it. And other
places in N.S.W. have to pay extra rates to
make up for the loss on the Berrigan transac-
tion, consequently their development is re-
tarded. So where does the development come
in ? Where the hindrance to
comes in is sufficiently obvious.
Q,. Govt, proposes — by-and-by — to bring in a
Bill to amend the “ Act for the Protection of
Aboriginals and the Prevention of the Sale of
Opium ” —spurred thereto chiefly by the death
of a Muttaburra Chinaman. The poor wretch,
robbed of his opium, went mad, and
ran wildly round the township. Being
hospitalled, he promptly died. When
post-mortemed, the medical dissector could
And no cause of death. “All the organs
were healthy, and showed no signs of any
disease likely to cause death.” Yet, after he
had become unconscious, “ his temperature rose
suddenly to 107 deg.” He had been in his
usual health on the previous morning. Local
Chows merely said— “ We see that befoh
many time ; p’leece stop him opium ; he die
mad.” Aren’t whites a lot of unsmirched
saiuts? In many cases where the Act has
missed flat murder, it has inflicted torture
worse than starvation. Whether the use of
opium is or is not desirable, or is or is not justi-
fiable, the brutal stupidity of cutting off the
opium-users’ supply at ten minutes’ notice is
simply damnable.
A daily paper’s London correspondent says
that there is an agitation among directors of
Anglo-Australian companies for improved tenure
of their mines. All right; what’ll they pay for
the improvement? The leases are for compara-
tively short terms, it is true —21 years, and so
on—and it may be owned up to at once that the
cos. might do more justice to the properties if
they could lay out their plans for a longer life.
Wherefore the term might be extended if
But, first, what’s the advantage in a short
term? Answer it with another—What’s the
good of a short Parliament? Obviously that the
people may kick out the members if they don’t
suit. So with the leases. As matters stand,
the country has the power, at the end of 21
years or whatever the term may be, to consider
a lessee’s conduct and act accordingly ; and as
the lessee knows that the lease is granted,
not solely for the benefit of the lessee, but to
secure the well-being of the people—who are the
owners and lessors—as well, the lessee also acts
accordingly. At any rate, he is restrained
from doing things that he might otherwise
attempt —the awful day of reck >ning comes
nearer and nearer. What gunrantee will J.
Bull give us that, suppose we do throw away
this safety catch, he won’t, let the cage to the
bottom of the shaft with a dull, sickening thud?
Bull may be able to contrive an effective sub-
stitute for the guarantee that the short lease
affords ; but The Bulletin can’t think of any
in time for this issue. And, moreover, it is not
its business to think of any. It’s Bull’s busi-
ness—he’s asking for a change. If a desired
further improvement is in the direction of
abolishing the labor conditions, what are they
going to give us for that ? The people who
own the mines (it’s just as well to keep
on repeating that to J. 8.) want room to
“ graft ”; and so they stipulate, when they
order the crowd off the grass, that room shall
be found for at least a couple of them per block.
It is a purely business arrangement —a conces-
sion made in lieu of rent. If, then, they under-
take that the lessee shall have the right to order
everybody off the grass, will J. Bull pay a rent
higher in proportion ? If he won’t, but still
expects us to make the change, what sort of an
idiot does he take these kawlinies to be?
At Brisbane, a little while ago, William
Eastwood, charged with failing (because he was
out of work) to support his children in the
orphanage, was given a week to find employ-
ment. Failing to get it, Pa Pinnock related to
him once more the old lying tale that any man
who really wants work can find it, and conceded
him another week. “If you haven’t got work
by that time I’ll give you three months,” said
the kind, fatherly Pinnock. It is a joyful thing
to be selected by any bull-headed official as the
one man in the great, hopeless array of the un-
employed, who must find inside a week a thing
which probably isn’t there, or else go to gaol
for three months. The Bulletin again invites
Pinnock to go penniless to some town where
he isn’t known, and call himself Smith,
labourer, and hustle round in moleskins after a
job which will keep body and soul together,
and see if there really is plenty of work for
every man who wants it. Then when he
has been warned off from 47 different places,
and has slept out in the park, and got rheuma-
tism in his old bones, and been ordered by some
other beak just like his own dreadful self that
he must find work immediately or go to gaol,
it may possibly dawn on him what a flinty ass
he has been. Anyhow, if Pinnock doesn’t try
this experiment then he doesn’t know whether
a man can get work or not, and he has no right
to say what, he doesn’t know, or to gaol any-
body for not doing what he can’t prove to be
possible.

The Federal Convention is gradually coming
round to the conviction, which this paper
arrived at a year ago, when it published “The
Bulletin’s Federal Constitution,” that the
railways and the public debts should be
taken over by the Commonwealth. But
though the members are coming round,
the process is slow ; it takes the aver-
age Convention delegate such a long, long
time to see even a plain business matter like
this that there is no visible hope of doing
any good about it this Convention.
The Age wants an adjournment and a
fourth Convention, so as to give this
urgent matter another chance, but another
long delay would probably kill Federation for
good. The best tiling to be done now is to
provide the easiest possible way of making
amendments in the Federal Constitution, and
get the Commonwealth started. After all, so
long as there is abundant opportunity for
repairinu the Constitution later on, the first
defects matter comparatively little.

The Wilson Barrett season opened at Her
Majesty’s with a very large attendance, yet the
writer has seen smaller audiences in Sydney where
the enthusiasm was considerably greater. The
ntter woefulness of the “ Manxman ” was partly
responsible. It is a tragic play, bathed in unutter-
able grief, and dragged through rivers of tribula-
tion, and then left to dry on the bank, and then
dragged through some more, and hung out in-
sensible on a line to recover consciousness.
I here is a touch of cheerfulness in the first act,
but after that the woe settles down on top of
everything like a depressed encyclopaedia in 26
volumes. Apart from the big, manly character of
Fete, which sheds a halo over the tale, there is
only a moderate amount of plot, and what plot it
amounts to is of a rather familiar order. Kate
Cregeen, the daughter of the hairy, pious ghoul
who keeps the public-house, is loved by Pete, who
has no assets save his noble heart and his huge
boots, and she loves Philip, who is rich, and has
prospects of rising to be a large tin-pot in
the island. Pete goes away to make his fortune,
leaving Philip to take care of his girl, and Philip
takes care of her in the old, old way and in shady
places late at night. She marries Pete when he
comes back rich, and lives miserably, and bolts
miserably, and the home breaks up. And when
Pete and Philip have had an explanation—the
sinful Philip sitting a crushed wri-ck with his
troubled conscience and his tall hat by his side—
they all separate. Pete starts miserably back to
Africa or somewhere. Philip trails wretchedly
away to the court, where he sits and lectures the
local thief. Kate drags the wreck of her once-
beautiful self back into the old public-house,
where it is understood that she is going to pass
the rest of her life in being preached at by her
father, the ferocious old moral publican with the
spectacles and the whiskers. The publican, at
the beginning of Act IV., is found rehearsing the
church choir in his yard and beating time with an
axe, and that is the only bright spot in his char-
acter all through.
• * * m
Pete is a noble, big-hearted personage,
and Wilson Barrett plays him with reasonable
success. His principal disadvantage is that he is
a heavy man who moves rather eumbrously in
his big boots. Barrett's Roman profile makes
The Bulletin desire to see him sideways as Nero
in the “ Sign of the Cross,” or, if he is too ponder-
ous for Nero, it would like to see him sideways as
Vitellius before that bloated Ctesar reached his
most mountainous condition. Barrett is un-
doubtedly a fine actor' in many respects, though
he doesn’t break any records. There is sometimes
an impression that a good deal more could be made
of Pete, who is a character of vast possibilities, and
usually has the centre of the stage all to himself.
Pete is a trifle lugubrious all the time, even in his
cheerful moments. He is at his best when his
house of cards and his Kitty come down in a heap
on his head ; then he suggests the strong, silent
hero, and his large sea-boots are set firmly but
heavily in the right path, and the audience rather
likes Barrett, and weeps copiously.
* * * *
Three other characters practically fill up
the rest of the story. The Kate Cregeen of Miss
Jeffries is a beautiful woman, stately, like the
departed Maxine Elliott, but brighter, less cum-
brous, and more intelligent than that vast, placid,
cow-like charmer. She is a bright, clever bit of
womanhood before her fall. She falls more grace-
fully than the average, inasmuch as she doesn’t
take to wearing shapeless, brown rags as an advt. of
her yvoe; and several times she provides a streak of
tragic intensity which suggests that the soul of the
real artist is in her. Percy val s Philip Christian is
an utterly colorless character ; Percyval is
chiefly remembered so far as the man who looks
like Titheradge and acts very unlike him.
Old publican Cregeen, as represented by Ambrose
Manning, is the most wholly satisfying person in
the cast. His make-up, his tones, his whiskers,
his steely glare through the big spectacles, and
the soured and embittered trot of his two big
feet, all suggest the most ferocious and vinegary
kind of Christian. He is played cleverly and con-
sistently, and The Bulletin just loves old publican
Cregeen. Miss Lillah McCarthy, as a pleasant
old lady, and Horace Hodges, as a mean-looking
subsidiary villain, one Ross Christian, fly round
on the outskirts of the play. A willing and
rather scientific little scrap between Philip and
Ross, and some good scenery with a lot of hay and
many roosters and their harem in it, also call for
mention.

A certain smattering of prosperity has
begun to manifest itself at Sydney Opera House
(dress-circle Is. 6d.) where the Barnes-Stanford
management is now in its third week. The old
dim curtain with the three angels painted on it
(the tight angel on the left who is staggering
among the clouds, and the doubled-up angel with
the huge bare feet on the right, and the tlnn angel
in the centre who apparently didn’t have enough
to eat) now looks down on better business than
the Opera House has seen for some little time.
The latest production, “Thou Shalt not Kill,” is
quite as good a drama as could be expected
for eighteenpence. It is something about a girl
who fell through the machinations of a clergy-
man when she was very young, and became a
beautiful and desperate Tottie. Later on she
marries a good old baronet with a green cucumber
in his hand, and then she finds her sinful parson
again. She hugs him in the old way, but he
coldly refuses to be hugged, and their troubles
and complications lead to the heaving of the
baronet over a cliff. After that the drama
becomes twenty times madder than could be ex-
pected even for eighteenpenc.e, and how mad a
drama may be expected to become for eighteen-
pence it takes a lot of experience to define. The
sinful J.P. who butchered the baronet holds a
wildly-inforinal inquiry, at which the chief witness
and the policeman fight in the court-room ; also he
arrests the parson. He likewise strangles the
baronet’s widow in her bedroom, but next day she
appears in her usual health, and her butchery
isn’t again alluded to. She is laid low at last by
the bad man’s poclcet Krupp just as everything
comes to light, but she takes a lot of killing.
* * • *
One especially hilarious scene in a drama
which gives a lot of mirth for eighteenpence, is
where the assassin pays ,£2OO to the man who saw
the murder, and takes a receipt in which
said man promises not to say anything about
the crime, and gravely puts the compromising
document in his pocket. Then he shoots in
an off-hand fashion at his visitor, and goes
away. The assassin, in fact, shoots at almost
everybody on sight; generally when he is intro-
duced to a person he fires on spec. Some of the
scenery is distinctly above the eighteenpehny
standard, and one or two members of the co. are
far superior to anything that could be reasonably
anticipated at Is. 6d. Miss Therese Lindahl is
beautiful and stately as the baronet’s married
Tottie, and her version of that soiled angel is a
very clever piece of work. Miss Alice Senior
does good work all the time : also Stanford and
Phil Walsh do good work part of the time. The
t’ ing which calls loudest for strong insult or
contumely or pigs-feet, or anything which can
express ill-feeling, is the unlovely woodenness of
the parson’s best girl. Whi n one considers that
the bad J.P. wades in blood together, his con-
duct is even below the eighteen penny average.
Also, the parson’s pants do a lot to bring his holy
calling into disrepute.
** * *
“ Nancy,” at Sydney Lyceum, was to have
been succeeded last Saturday by the “ Terror of
Paris,” but business was so good that the manage-
ment decided to rcll the old drama along for
another week. Pretty Lilian Wheeler, in the
short, innocent frock of Nancy, may have had
something to do with the boom. In the first act
of the drama there is a festive gathering of boat-
men and their wives round the long deal table
with the gin on it, and Nancy’s weather-beaten
parent makes a speech, in the course of which he
states that Nancy is a good girl, well brought up,
and able to swing an ugly left if called upon.
Nancy rests a small, dimpled paw on the table by
way of unreliable corroboration, but possibly the
public kept on going in the hope that she might
bash somebody by-and-by, or chew Diver in the
midst of his wickedness, or otherwise assert her-
self. So far, however, Miss Wheeler hasn’t swung
that alleged ugly left of hers on anybody.

The three Elegelmanns are near the end
of their season at Sydney Tivoli, and the gym-
nasts who come after them will have a very large
contract on hand. Anyone else who comes to the
country and wants to pose as the most wonderful
person on earth in that line will have to do some-
thing very unusual indeed, and it is rather difficult
to imagine what the Hegelmann crowd has left
for anyone else to do.

Harmston s Circus, which has been doing
big business in Wragge-land, is due in Belmore
Park, Sydney, on April 2.

That veteran comedian J. A. South is to
have a benefit to-morrow (Friday, 11th March), at
the regimental hall, Victoria Barracks, under
powerful military patronage.

Albani, on her return to Sydney, will give
three concerts ere leaving for good—two evening
affairs and a matinee. In addition, some oratorios
will be negotiated in conjunction with the Phil-
harmonic, who will make a noise during April.
** * *
The Sydney rush to hear Albani was not
exactly repeated in Melbourne last Saturday, for
although a hundred or two enthusiasts stood
around the Town Hall entrances as early as six
o’clock, there were some seats available in all
three divisions of the auditorium when the tardy
Governor turned up. Perhaps the people who
stayed away had taken a packed house for granted
and were holding back their rush for subsequent
concerts. Anyway, the organ-gallery, which had
been made ready for a five-shilling overflow, re-
mained as bare as Mother Hubbard’s cupboard
likewise a few rows of seats, upstairs and down-
stairs, at the farthest end of the building. Ail the
same, a very imposing crowd welcomed Madame
Albani with a sober and reasonable show of
gladness, and the performance in general got a
promising reception. To expect thrilling results
from Albani’s autumnal voice is to be disap-
pointed, of course. It is older, for its age, than
the comely lady herself, who appears to have been
much less careful than Patti of her splendid
natural gift. A faded voice, and gone at the edge
in some places, yet, nevertheless—as The Bul-
letin remarked in Sydney—the voice that Albani
utters and makes the most of. The artist cannot
use it with the facility of former days, and her
breathing is audible afar off, but the consciousness
and confidence of a triumphant past are in her
vocal efforts whilst, the charm of her platform
manner goes for much. Albani at least shows
cause for a great reputation when she attacks an
operatic number. William Pauli, the baritone of
the co., made a big success on Saturday. The
mezzo, Miss Sarah Berry, and violinist, Miss
Clench, were encored with rather less vehemehce,
and Orlando Harley—scarcely recognisable ih any
respect as the tenor whocarne out here with Foli—
managed to fetch ’em with a sentimental song.
To-night (Thursday) and Saturday are the remain-
ing Albani occasions in Melbourne.

The joyous pantomime at the Opera
House announces the last nights of its Melbourne
career. Addie Conyers doesn’t slay the Giant any
more. She passed out of the show on Friday,
and Miss Fdie Hay tor, who is a fine, massive boy
to put in the foreground anyway, has undertaken
to lay the Giant low for the rest of the season.
As a matter of fact, the monster isn’t laid low.
Circumstances compel him to remain upright
during his death agonies, and after he has received
a mortal wound as though it were a stitch in the
side, he walks away to join the great majority.

“ Shadows of a Great City,” at Melb.
Royal, is a broad, irrational production, supported
by some deserving scenery and a respectable co.
The Firm brought “ The Shadows ” from America
long ago, when Maggie Moore, J. C. Willi am sob
and Kate Bishop were concerned ih a valorous
attempt to make it appeat a first-class article.
Time hasn’t mellowed the dialogue, or recon-
structed the plot, and there doesn’t seem to beany
reason, bar Grattan Riggs, for restoring this
memory of the past to its original haunt. Riggs
plays Biddy Roonan, an Irish faymale with a
warm har-r-r-r-t and a s(>-inch waist, in a humor-
ous, inoffensive style, but considering that
Maggie Moore could do the same thing ten times
better, it seems a pity for the male comedian to do
it at all. “The Shadows” fortunately doesn’t
give way to gloom and tears as often as might be
expected, and the co.—comprising Charles Hollo-
way, Chalmers, Temple Harrison, Willard, Miss
Leighford, and Miss Fugenie Duggan—keeps the
trouble moving at a fair pace. Business is very
good at the Royal of late, and manager Holloway
intends to knock creation, in a week or two, with
a new and gorgeously-mounted draina—“ Whteh
London Sleeps, ”
** * *
“The Frelich Mhid,” following Wilson
Barrett at Melb. iMncess’s, appears rather friskier
than before, and her lack of high moral tone is not
lamented. Sundry alterations have happened to
this particular breezy nothing since its previous
outbreak. A new shade of hair and a touch of
sentiment are supplied by Miss Leitch in the place
of Miss Wray, whose weird warble has achieved
the honor of an imitation by clever Albert Whelan,
which imitation certainly softens the blow of Miss
W. s departure. Changes, taken altogether, are
perhaps an improvement, and the ballet in any
case dances where it did; also, the scenery and
dresses maintain their early splendour. Bert
Gilbert, Coleman, George de Lara, Howard
Vernon, and other male features appear to
be doing much the same as of yore, and Miss
Ada Reeve is doubtless back in the name-part ere
now. On Saturday the little leading lady sprained
her ankle, a calamity that enabled The Bulletin’s
young friend, Miss Carrie Moore, to step into the
invalid’s French shoes, as Susette. The under-
study sang her songs expressively, and her per-
formance at all points was most commendable,
** * *
“ Moths,” at Melb. Bijou, is a more smooth
and shiny show than on the opening night. The
new co. has got the correct pitch of the house at
last, and the ladies whose characters don’t fit
them are not so obviously misplaced as they were.
Correze, too, lias warmed to his work considerably,
and needs only a little more stage mattagetneht to
make him an imposing young man. The moths
of sassiety will nibble into the beautiful fabric of
Miss Lamb’s virtuous disposition for two nights
longer. On Saturday the Cartwright co. tackles
A Marriage of Convenience.” and the pretty
curtain-raiser, “Dream Faces.”

This week’s struggle at the Alexandra is
“ The Factory Girl of Melbourne,” and a steam-

sympathy for that overwrought toiler.

Wilson Barrett tells an interviewer: “I
start with the view that Hamlet was not a man of
30, but a lad of 19 or 20.” There is nothing the
matter with W.B.’s view of Hamlet’s age except
that he (the actor) can’t possibly communicate it
to his audience. Barrett, for as long as the writer
can remember him, has been essentially a heavy
actor—heavy about the head and neck ; heavy in
his movements (as compared with the activity of
such a mature “boy” as Bellew, or the'late
Charles Ryley); and, above all things, heavy in
his voice and elocution. Any attempt by Wilson
Barrett to portray a youth will always be a failure.
Witness his uncanny representation of the boy-
poet Chatterton. Despite the actor’s earnestness
and skilful attention to stage-business details the
performance is painfully unreal. “ Chatterton,”
at Melb. Princess’s, the other afternoon, set the
present scribe thinking of the first shock he ever
experienced from a “leading man.” It was in a
small provincial theatre, and they were playing
“ Lady of Lyons.” Widow Melnotte appeared to
be a very young person, with a grey wig on her
head and the traditional lines of age painted on
her face. The door of her cottage was fluno-
violently open, and there came pounding ponder-
ously into the kitchen a list, rooster, who held
aloft a gun decorated with gaudy ribbons, and
crowed in tones of rumbling thunder, “I have
won the per-rize, moth-er! ” This was the
widow’s son, Claude Melnotte, starting with the
view that he was a gushing ini ant of 19, or so.
* * * .
It isn’t an actor’s reading of a Shake-
spearian part but his interpretation of his reading
that the audience has to consider. For instance
the Cassio (Wigney Percyval) in the Wilson Bar-
rett co.’s poor performance of “Othello ’ doubt-
less reads the lines of the famous “drunken
scene ” aright to himself. He wishes to represent
a dashing young soldier in a state of reckless in-
toxication. But he doesn’t succeed. His attempt
fails absurdly. It is one thing to aim at appear-
ing drunk, and quite another thing to strike your
audience to that effect. If Wilson Barrett as
Othello, were required to go on the burst,’ he
would read the fact intelligently enough, but he
wou dn’t con vey the intelligence to the house in a
convincing manner-judging from his attempts at
razzle-dazzle portraiture in “ Ben-my-Chree ” and
“Silver King.”
Cartwright has a singularly attractive voiee, a tine in-
strument capable of expressing every shade of feeling
and having more inflections to the sentence than the
writer has discovered in the tongue of any other pro. he
can call to mind. In a play of French origin this quality
means much, since the giddy little insinuation is often
quite lost for the want of the tiniest tilt of the tongue
At Poverty Point.
“ The benefit to be tendered Nellie Farren, who is look-
ing- sadly old,” writes Tub Bulletin's London correspond-
ent, “ is dated tor March 17, at Drury Lane, and the aim
of the promoters is to land L5OOO for the flickering days
of the once-briliiant beam of burlesque. The Prince of
Pals, with his immediate titled following, has given his
patronage and presence, on the strength of which, as
bait, the stall prices have been lilted to five guineas,
dress-circle front two guineas, and no form or corner less
than 7-s. 6d. All the greatest stars, meteorites, and sky-
signs of the theatrical sphere have expressed a willing
desire to revolve, sparkle, melodise, and tend generally tc
make things hum on and around the programme. Nellie
Stewart, the Bernard Beeres, Willie Edouin, Winifred
Emery are there, also Irving. Ellen Terry, Cyril Maude,
Arthur Roberts, Hawtrey, See., &c. . The bill is to.be
composite, and should give the finest combination of con-
cert, theatre, and ‘ hall ’ talent ever got together in
London.”
There have been fevered proceedings in Sydney Liedei**
tafel over the election of a new conductor. Hinemoft
Hill’s supporters were specially assertive) and threatened
all sorts of things if their selection were ignored; The
Warden of the Sydney College of Music, who temporarily
shook his stick while Delaney was ill, was also an appli-
cant, and any number bf small fry applied with..testi-
monials of a marvellous character. Several black eyei
will be in eVidehce shortly.
||That popular Sydney 'cellist, Edgar Straus, has been
Very ill, and will not,he himself for a few months. Mr.
Straus is not rich, and a movement is afoot to give him a
benefit. As he is a singularly generous man, and much-
liked by the profession, no difficulty is anticipated in
obtaining a bumper attendance.
Has Albani ever been an amateur sprinter ? Her little
race-on and race-off the stage recall the antics of the
joyous youthful sheep or the frisky junior goat in spring-
time. Artemus Ward struck an immortal truth when he
sadly observed that “ Women and cows shouldn’t run.”
T.D. : “Several of Australia's coming’ Pattis and
Patevs latelj' inaugurated their local careers by taking
farewell benefits, but they never seem to make their fare-
well appearances. Glaring instances of this are too
prominent to need mention, and one or two young ladies
still hang out the vocal shingle in Sydne3’,- whose benefits,
‘prior to going Ome to Marchesi,’ were given so long
ago as to be almost forgotten. Tenors are nearly as bad.
Walshe and J. Simonsen both farewelled Australia at dis-
tant intervals before their ultimate departures, but they
did go in the end.” -
H. : “In the file of London Athenaeum, I find that
Evelyn Bellew, Kyrle’s eldest brother, made an unsuccess-
ful debut, at the London Standard Theatre, as Hamlet, in
May, 1875. Was Kyrle then in Melb. or London ? One of
his earliest performances was Osric, in a revival of Irving's
Hamlet. He used to complain of a bogus brother,, evi-
dently not the one referred to above, Pastor Bellew, his
father, once read I-lalnlet, in London, with performers
doing the characters in dumb-show,”
Paradis: “The only original play by the superibr
French Boucicault, Sardou, is said to be ‘ Maison NeuveJ
A wife, irritated by her husband’s falsity, sends for a
gallant, whom she has hitherto strenuously resisted. He
comes drunk. She is shocked, and orders him away. Bitt
he won’t go, Then she persuades him to take a few drops
of physic to sober him Up. They have no effect. His
grabs the phial, drinks the lbt, and falls senseless on the
floor, as she supposes dead. She only has time to scurry
him under the sofa when her husband comes with friertds.
She has to keep seated on the sofa, and carefully shroud
a slice of lover Which sticks out. Much fine acting, of
course.’*
“What is a Show without- a cinematographe ?” The
manager of a Successful silver-eoih shbiv is making ar-
rangements t'p.riih a high-class cm. in conjunction with
his bloodthirsty dramas.
At a silver coin performance of “ Under Two Flags,” the
rival vessels meet and the crews mix in a gory hand-to-
hand encounter. It is a willing go considering that the
rival crews consist of one man ori each boat.
Henry Arthur Jones’s professed contempt for his share
in the manufacture of “ Silver King” again recalls that
Jones and his collaborator, Hermann, quarrelled qver
their respective claims of authorship as soon as they had
begun to divide the profits of a joint success. Hermann
devised the plot and gave the “ robust sentiment” to the
play, whilst Jones put in the character sketches and the
principal speeches, and an epic-rani here and there—it is
generally supposed. Absurd of Jones .to despise “ the
dull devil of spectacular drama,” which brought him into
notice. “The Silver King,” despite the out-of-dateness
of its opening scene- Denvers don't go t,o the dogs in
skittle-alleys nowadays—will be alive when every play
written by Jones “on his own” has passed out .of
memory.
Lamp : “ Doubtless there is a falsehood of extremes
both ways in viewing the stage. While Clement Scott
diatribes, Francisque Sarcey declares the Parisian theatre
suffers through the excessive virtue, respectability, bour-
geoisie, of young actors and actresses. He sighs for the
Bohemians of vore-time! I suppose you will not get a
Kean without his freaks, Ids Wolf Club, and riding his
black horse Shylock up Drury Lane steps at 3 a.m. Then
they say it took Brooke a bottle of brandy to stand up
for Othello.”
One of the rules of the English censor of plavs is that
the character of a bishop must not be shown farcically,
except it be that of a colonial bishop !
At the last meeting of the London Theatrical Guild,
Mrs. Clement Scott prefaced her speech with the words—
“Tlie great and good man whose name I have the honor
to bear,” etc. Always train a wife in the way she should
go, and some day she’ll blow your trumpet for you.
Pro. : “ Curious the way a jest catches on in a Perth
audience. First, a little laugh will be heard in one corner
of the auditorium, and then, bit by l>it, it will ripple
round the house, to end in a universal shriek, followed
by a clatter of hand-applause. They don’t seem to grip
as quickly there as they do in a Sydney, Brisbane, or
Melb. audience. Anyhow, Winton (here with Rickards’
Biograph c. 0.) used to find himself in the middle of the
next joke before the laugh at the last had started. So did
Thornton.”
Barrett resents the Melbourne criticism of his Othello.
“ Cold blows the wind across the Moor.”
A MESSAGE FROM THE QUEEN.
That gracious message from the Queen,
It works with magic power :
"t gets for one a crowded hall,
And brings a golden shower.
What matter though the critics say
Our voice is nearly done?
A royal message rubs the spots
From off the setting suit;
What, matter if hut littie’s lefj;
Of what was once so grand,?
The. music of a social “ tone ”
All snobs,can understand.
And even tHe vtce-'regal sets ~

To pay respect to one who has —
A message from the Queen !

N.S.W. revenue for February, 1898 (£671,171),
was £68,617 better than that for February, 1897, so the
income for the first eight months of the present financial
year is now only £126,839 less than that for the corre-
sponding period of last year. But the month’s expendi-
ture (£763,917) was fully £90,000 larger than the revenue,
so the yawning deficit keeps getting bigger. With eight
months of the financial year gone the shortage is now
£517,309, which is a tremendous lee-way to make up. At
this time last year the shortage was £442,614, so there is
a bigger gap to fill this year than last. And the shortage
would be still worse, only £14,300 has been charged dur-
ing the iiast month back to “1895 and previous years”
—back to the old, handy, elastic, ever-useful “ Dibbs
deficit,” in fact. It was announced many months ago
that only about £7OOO remained to be charged to these
by'gone years, but still the process of debiting items of
expenditure back, and diminishing this year’s shortage by
making the 1893 or 1894 shortage larger, goes on gaily',
and the Cash Basis never gets really started.
During the past eight months the N.S.W. loan
expenditure has been £1,123,188 against £946,303 for the
corresponding period of last y'ear, or an increase of
£176,885. So things are again as reported a month ago :
the big deficit getting bigger, and the public debt in-
creasing faster. The only present prospects seem to be :
(1) To shove along the big land auction of 110,000 acres
which is advertised for this month, the money to be paid
in June just in time for this .vear’s revenue ; (2) to make
a special effort in the way' of leaving this year’s accounts
unpaid during the four remaining months ; (3) to charge
as much ordinary expenditure as possible to loans or to
the legendary “ Dibbs deficit ” ; (4) to hustle up the
seizure of the Education Fund ; and (5) to have the
general election in June, before the deficit has to be for-
mally announced.

When S. A. resolved to undertake the manage-
ment of its British debt through the Agent-General’s
office, instead of employing’ a bank as agent, there was a
howl among influential authorities on finance about the
ridiculous impossibility of the scheme. It has worked
well enough, however, and the cost is £lOO per annum for
each million of debt. Victoria does its business through
a bank at £250 per million. N.S.W. pays its bank in
London on an average t’425 per million— £17,000 a year
more than it would pay on the S.A. basis, and £9OOO a
year more than on the Victorian basis! And £9OOO a
year is equivalent, at present rates, to a lump sum of
£300,000 —so isn’t it time to have a change ?
» * * *
Victoria’s revenue for February (£530,409) was
£25,035 less than for Feb., ’97. The receipts for the eight
months of the financial year which are just gohe are still
£133,409 more than those for the corresponding eight
months of last year, but the improvement doesn’t seem to
keep up very well. The revenue has kept well ahead all
the way round, and now', just as it turns into the straight
for the run home, it begins to wobble badly.
* * * *
Queensland’s revenue for February (£222,459)
was over £2OOO better than that for Feb., ’97. Tasmania,
for February, had a revenue of £71,760, which is £12,742
more than the takings for February, ’97.

The ordinary life department of the Citizens’
Life Assurance Go. (Sydney) show’s the best y'ear it has
yet experienced. The premium income for 1897 w’as
£64,669, and the total income, including interest on
investments, £70,012. Out of this, no less than £44,707
w 7 as added to the accumulated funds, which now stand at
£155,218. The following is six years’ record of the
Citizens’ ordinary life department
Income. Amount added
to funds.
1892 .. £15,641 .. £11,187
1893 .. 20,488 .. 14,636
1894 .. 31,080 .. 18,208

1896 .. 55,483 .. 31,059
1897 . 70,012 .. 44,707
The expenses are always kept down to exactly 15 per
cent, of the income, so the ordinary branch of the Citi-
zens’ is, on paper at least, the cheapest-managed office in
Aus'ralia, the A.M.P. only excepted, and it runs the
A.M.P. very close. Also, the securities look good enough,
even though “freehold property” has increased dur-
ing the year from £5478 to £16,912, which is rather
a large increase in a kind of investment that is none too
reliable. Whether the increase arises through purchase,
or foreclosure of mortgages, or how’, doesn’t appear.
The Industrial Branch (the depressing 3d. and
6d. a week business),which is far the larger part of the Citi-
zens, doesn t look nearly’;so promising. Six years’ record
of the Industrial Department is, as follows :
Income Amount

1892 .. £109,686 . ... £24,460
1893 .. 112,957 .. 21,763

1896 .. 146,647 .. 11,655
1897 .. 156,144 .. 167
One apparent explanation is this ; The expenses of the
Ordinary Department are limited to 15 per cent. Con-
sidering the experience of very much larger offices than
the Citizens’ the chances are that the Ordinary Life De-
partment isn’t worked for 15 per cent, or even for 20.
Any’ expenses above the 15 must be charged to the In-
dustrial Dept, because there is nothing else to charge
them to, and if the Ordinary Life Department continues
to boom as at present it will probably grow so big that its
expenses, over and above 15 per cent., will be more
than the Industrial can fairly carry. The dividend of
10 per cent, to shareholders is charged wholly to the
Industrial; also the depreciation of furniture, and the
great bulk of everything. The Industrial expenses for
1897 were £83,954 or 58 per cent, of premiums, as com-
pared with £74,630 or 57J per cent, of premiums in 1896 —in
other words, the total income increased by £10,500 and
expenses swallpw’ed up £9300 of the increase. During the
last two y’ears 1 12,600 of the Industrial income has been
“ profit on realisation of securities,” and but for this wind-
fall the funds would actually have decreased. If the
Ordinary Branch keeps growing at the present rate, and
the Industrial keeps remaining about stationary at the
present rate, the chances are that the Ordinary will have
to pay a far bigger share of the expenses by-and-bye,
which will damage its glory considerably.

The Citizens’ co. is just now pulling down its
premises in Castlereagh-street, Sydney, with a view to
building a finer building on the site. This involves the
destruction of the old building—an asset which ap-
pears to stand for a pretty large amount in the accounts.
Judging by the Industrial Department’s accounts, any-
how, this doesn’t seem a very good time to meet any
losses. Also a feature of the Citizens’ which concerns
policy-holders materially is that it is a proprietary con-
cern, and the people who supply the money' have no voice
whatever in the management. Out of £346,000 of funds
the shareholders supply £22,350, and the people who own
this £22,350 run the whole show. There isn’t even a
large body of shareholders to supervise the directors ;
the directors and a few officials of the co. are the princi-
pal shareholders, so it would appear that in the main they
supervise themselves.

The Bulletin now learns that auditor Souther-
den, of the Q.N. Bank, quitted the service of Gibbs,
Bright and Co. before he became professional overhauler
of the books of the Drury institution. Therefore, the
inference that Hart, of Gihbs, Bright and Co., who helped
direct the Q.N.8., was practically audited by his own
doesn’t hold water.

The sale of the business of the Queensland
Mutual Insurance Co. to the Manchester Fire Co., was
duly ratified, and, so far as Tiie Bulletin’s information
goes, no explanation of the mysterious circumstances of
the sale was offered. The case, as it is persistently told
by the man in the street with much circumstantial detail,
is this : The shares of the Queensland Mutual were worth
about 3s. 3d. or 3s. 6d. The management, or some of it,
received an offer from the Manchester co. to buy the
business and assets at 10s. a share. Thereupon a share-
broking firm proceeded to circularise the shareholders
wholesale, offeVing to buy shares on behalf of somebody at
something’ like 45., and many holders sold before the Man-
chester co.’s offer was made public, and thereby lost 6s. a
share. The person or persons who bought apparently
knew about the offer to purchase, and also had access to
the share-register in the office. Also, the fact that there
was an offer to buy’ the business seems to have remained
very' dark while these deals were going on. All of which
has led to much language on the part of people who
sold for 4s. shares worth 10s.

That very mild little institution, the Austra-
lasian Mutual Live Stock Insurance Co., reports a profit
for the past year of £ls9—equal to a very little over 3 per
cent, on the modest capital of £4780. In 1893 the profit
was £2 ; 1894 showed a loss of £1; 1895 produced a loss of
£3 13s. 9d., but since then things have looked up a little,
and the co. has now £335 of accumulated profits. The
total liabilities to shareholders and the public are £5585,
and the visible assets are put down at £1335. The very
wide gap is filled in by setting down “ goodwill ” as
worth £4250. The Live Stock Insurance Co. paid
its last dividend in the year God knows when, and The
Bulletin forgets how it arrived at its present painful
state. Anyhow, “ Goodwill, £4250 ” is a very beautiful
item.

The insolvency of Cyprian Stanton, late of the
City Bank of Sydney, is the old, old story of the manager
who was applied to by' himself for an overdraft, and hav-
ing been acquainted with the applicant for many years,
and having the highest opinion of him, granted it imme-
diately without security. Still, it is sometimes hard to
draw the line about the manager’s overdraft. In the case
of Drury, of the Q.N.8., for instance: If Drury, while
manager of the Q.N.8., had kept his account at some
other bank it would have created an impression that he
couldn’t risk the coin in his own institution. Yet Drury
knew his bank too well to trust it with a credit balance,
and the bank ought to have known its Drury a great deal
better than to trust him with an overdraft—but it didn’t.
So there they were.

Industrial and Provident Permanent Benefit
Building and Investment Society (Sydney), with a capital
of only £80,040, contrived to earn £5154 profit for 1897.
The visible reason is that the concern with the name that
is so long that the other end can only be seen on a clear
day' doesn’t speculate in property of its own, has no big
mortgage on top of it, no debentures, and only owes
£1044 on deposits altogether.

The Metropolitan Mutual Permanent Building
and Investment Association (Sydney) shows a loss of
£2945 for 1897. This co. has £140,000 capital and proper-
ties to an alleged value of £283,720, which only yield
£6708 net for the year—equal to £2 Bs. per cent, per
annum. Said properties are tottering under liabilities
to the extent of £142,000, which is probably not far
from their present sale value, and as the interest runs to
£8325 for the year, or £l6OO more than the entire net
yield of the properties, there is very little prospect of
dividends this century anyhow. The reserve-fund is now
swallowed up all except 1 14, so next .year’s loss will begin
to chew large holes in the capital. If the Metropolitan
had been content in the boom days to own £150,000 worth
of property unencumbered, instead of grabbing after
£300,000 worth with a mountainous mortgage on it,
things might have been different.

The announcement that one of the big Ameri-
can assessment life assurance companies proposes starting
business in Australia is another roundabout reminder
of the fact that this country, through the absolute want
of any legal standard of solvency, or any State audit, or
any decent precautionary legislation of any kind, is a grand
field for the foreign and local life-assurance swindle. The
assessment system is .mostly swindle. The ordinary sol-
vent life office always keeps on hand a fund, accumulated
from premiums, equal to the full present value of its lia-
bilifes, and if three-.fourths or five-sixths of its policy-
holders took their surrender values and left, it would be
quite as solvent as ever with regard to those who re-
mained. The assessment co. bursts when a lot of its
policy-holders quit. Its principle is that every one pays
a small sum regularly to cover his share of working ex-
penses. Death claims are met by calls on members —that
is to say, they’ are met if enough calls can be got in.
The older a" member gets the heavier are the
calls, and when a member lives to a great
age and becomes poor and past work the calls gener-
ally get so heavy that he is frozen out after paying regu-
larly for many years, and dies uninsured after all. In
the ordinary life-office the old, impoverished member wlm
has been paying for 30 to 40 years can generally let his
policy slide for the last seven or eig’ht or ten .vears of his;
life—the bonuses keep it in force. Ordinary life assurance
gives the biggest profits to the old member ; the assess-
ment business breaks the old member by striking hi
with the biggest calls. In the ordinary life-office th
premiums get smaller with years because the bonuses can
be applied in reduction of premiums ; in the assessment
system they grow bigger.
In the U.S., the home of this unlucky system,
the assessment co.’s go bankrupt by dozens. They mostly
collapse from the same cause—inability to collect enough
calls from live members to meet the claims in regard to
dead members. The assessment co. is simply a life
assurance office which gives credit to its customers with-
out security, and its promise to pay £lOOO at death is
really a promise that it will pay that amount if it can
collect it from the other fellows. The assessment assur-
ance curse has grown so bad in the U.S. that in several
states there is a movement to prohibit it altogether. If
this alluring game is allowed to start in Australia the need
for some vigorous life assurance legislation will be more
urgent than ever.

Melbourne just now shelters an organised gang

swindle to a very large amount daily. All the men con-
cerned are legitimately named similarly to well-known
wealthy citizens, and unfortunately for the changers it is
only after the cheques are returned that the difference
between the wealthy and the worthless parties is dis-
covered. The law unfortunately does not allow of prose-
cution on a “ worthless ” cheque when the drawer has
any'thing at all to his credit in the bank on which it is
drawn. Hence the conspirators avoid arrest by having a
few shillings at the banks on which cheques are drawn, at
times, for scores of pounds.

Onlooker : “ I express no opinion on the merits
or demerits of the remarks of the chairman of the White
Cliffs Opal Mines, Ltd.— vide Bulletin, Feb. 26—but sub-
mit the following reliable information :—When the co.
took over the property, there were at work, bringing in.
the vast returns mentioned, about 300 tributors, nearly all
at 75 per cent, tribute and ‘ nothing found,’ and working
on Block 1, admittedly the best on the field. These were
replaced, there and then, by some 35 or 40 wages-men, who
continued to work throughout the 3'ear in question—tri-
butors were not employed till the last four months of the
financial year, the percentage being 50 per cent, and
tools, etc., found, no inconsiderable item- These were not
allowed to tribute on Block 1 either. The system of ‘ open
cut ’ adopted entailed a terrible amount of development,
and having to pass through a lot of worked ground. The
heart of the good opal country has only now been reached,
so that the returns in question are not disproportionate to
those of previous 3'ears. It seems to me that the directors
of the co. have an idea, as you say, that their property, as
the name would suggest, embraces the whole of the field.
They do not seem to realise that a lot of new opal country
has been opened up since they bought t;heir property,
said country being responsible for a lot of saleable opal
during the past year. While not admitting that opal-
stealing is common, it is pretty clear that some of the
gem goes astray, and supervision is indeed difficult. If a
law were passed requiring all opal-buyers to be licensed,
and a record kept of all their transactions in opal (sqch
record to be open to official inspection) it would give the
legitimate buyer a locus standi, and do away with the
illicit opal-buyer. Such would be better for both bona-fide
buyer and seller.”

Contributing shareholders in the Mt. David
mine (N.S.W.) are having their little funeral, and are in-
dignant—no wonder—at the manner in which they have
been fooled. “In conclusion (say’s the chairman in his ex-
planation), I wish to point out that no prospectus was
ever issued, and the public were never asked to come in.”
But they' got there all the same. Men went in under the
impression that the money they' put up went to work the
mine, instead of to pay for it. The present position is
embarrassing, for if the co. called up all the capital it
“ would still be £5OOO in debt.” The syndicate subscribed
for the contributing shares in the first instance. What
it did with them afterwards is clear. The right thing
to do under the would be to sell them at
any price ; failing that, to give them away. Right-think-
ing persons don’t object to parting with a liability. The
chairman’s explanation evades the issue : that the co. was
formed with a capital of £120,000, that five-sixths of this
was issued as paid-up, that the remaining sixth had to pay
for the mine and work it, and has still to face the music.
In fact, five-sixths of the mine represents very little more
than the option held to purchase it ! It is a new way of
fooling N.S.W. people, though it has been practised
in two or three other instances. Had the Mt.. David mine
turned out remarkably well —which would mean striking
something richer than the oWner ever saw—no trouble
would have occurred, but, as usual, it didn’t. By dint of
cautious selection the owner managed to get out some
200 tons of rich ore and then got £ll,OOO cash for the
mine. While the plant was going up two or three small
lots were sent to Sydney—“which went well.” Assays,-
too, were sent all the way to Maoriland. These, too,
“ went well.” An oz. per ton, at least, was expected
from the bulk —which has only gone a few dwts. A new
manager finds the machinery has been put in the
wrong place, and that other serious mistakes have been
made ; and the statements before made, and as often
denied, that the reef is erratic in quality and that the ore
must be gouged or otherwise picked, are now admitted.
And there is the devil to pay. And yet how those shares
have been tipped and boomed, in and out of print!

N.S.W. has to wait on London papers for official
news of most of the Bull-owned mines working in the pro-
vince. Surely 7 the country’ owning the mines is entitled
to know what is being done with them by their lessees?
In gold-mining, the biggest work is being done by’ the
Angio-Australian co. Its operations are controlled by
Eissler, who has displayed good judgment in buying, has
done good work in opening up, and, better still, has had
big luck. According to the last reports published in Lon-
don anew body of ore has been opened in the Gallymont
mine, driven on for 90ft., and bulk assay samples give an
average of some 9oz. per ton for an average width of 3ft.
The Gibraltar, on the other hand, does not seem to be
looking as well as usual, but it is difficult to get at the
bottom of things unless yields are known within a reason-
able time of their being made.

with the duffer carried, whereby small shareholders are
relieved of a big portion of their interest, and forced to
become interested in the duffer. But trouble is brewing.

Occidental (the N.S.W. low-grade mine) report

more than a dwt. less than the average of the last seven
years. During these years 50,000 tons have been milled
for an average of a fraction over 4dwts., leaving nearly as
much in the tailings easily treated by cyanide. Last half-
year showed a working profit of over ,1000. The
manager attributes the fall in the average return to the
quantity of surface debris put through the battery as a
cheaper means of getting rid of it than carting it away,
and better returns are anticipated.

The curse of the Sabbath tipster—or something
nearly as bad —has fallen on the Girilambone mine,
N.S.W., the shares of which mine have nearly come back
to where they started from—los. When they reached,
for a brief stay, 355., people were strongly advised to buy
them, as they were “ sure to see £5.” It would be inter-
esting to know who sold them at 355. Now proposed to
reconstruct by issuing 50,000 new shares paid up to 7s.
6d., calling up 2s. at once and the balance as required—
and it all will be required, if half the statements made of
the financial position of this concern are true. That it is
carrying a camel-load of debt is obvious. It is impossible
to ascertain from the balance-sheet to what purposes the
£12,500 debentures have been applied ; then there is
another item of £5263 exclusive of debentures. The only
uncalled capital is £3500. To the writer, the whole thing
is mysterious. Wanted by the public, a detailed statement
from the directors.

Dear Bulletin. — The transparent perversion of
“ Shareholder” (?) (Lake George mines), in your issue of
26th Feb., savours too much of the proverbial herring
drawn across the track. Let him once more read the par.
in yours of 12th Feb. Tonnage and percentage only are
referred to. Assay value has been introduced bv “ Share-
holder,” with a clumsy attempt to discount the intelli-
gence of the “public generally,” who are quite able to.
discriminate ’tween tonnage and assay value. He might
now enlighten the “ public generally ” as to the centesimal
loss of copper, silver and gold which prevails in putting
coke and a blast furnace against an ore like that of Lake
George. This would be interesting to the “public
generally',” who have been invited to assist with a cool
£50,000. Just allow me to remind you that the returns
published only give the percentage of extraction, and are
ominously silent as to copper charged to furnaces. Iq
short, what is the loss? —Sulphur.

T. P. Lyons, writing to Kalgoorlie Miner, re-
marks that the Maritana management “ has apparently
endeavored from the first to spend money on the i ine
without producing satisfactory results. They have over-
looked the fact that depth is required to bring it on a level
with the Boulder, or even the Mt. Charlotte. Instead of
s’nking to, say, 500 ft., they are spendingthe shareholders’
money foolishly in driving on what is already known to
be practically the cap of the lode. To perform that
reco nised useless work, the mining - engineer,
manager, the Melb. office, and four men are em-
ployed, and are taking in sa’aries, etc., the monthly
calls made on shareholders. In order to stop such ex-
pensive and fruitless proceedings, I ask m3' fellow
shareholders to join with me in getting six months’
exemption, and to take the management from the present
directors, putting it into the hands of practical men who
have the knowledge and the will to give us something in
return for the money we have expended. The expenses
at present are at the rate of £8709 per 3'ear. By allowing
£3500 to keep a mining engineer or expert, a manager,
and four men, including mining material and the Melb.
office, there would still remain 5200 to be accounted for,
regarding which probably the management can give an
explanation.”

The Brassey Curse is cosmopolitan, and
quite ready to supplement a local mishap with an
imported casualty. Much about the time that
the Sunbeam was making yet another attempt at
perdition on the Victorian coast the other day, the
wife of Gov. Brassey’s nephew, H. L. Brassey,
was rolled over by her horse in the hunting-field,
in England, and had a leg smashed. Why is it,
by the way, that there is never any Marine Board
inquiry into these Sunbeam misadventures ? Even
if alleged master-mariner Brassey isn’t in personal
charge of the hooker on these occasions, some
qualified person is supposed to be in command,
and has no more right to escape inquiry than any
other shipmaster.
It evidently runs in the family—this
disposition to fall off something and get
hurt. The Bulletin begs herewith to ques-
tion the fairness of permitting Gov. Brassey to go
’Ome on a steamer unless he be, to some extent,
chained up. Although destined to suffer disaster
of one sort or other, he could have his destiny
placed under reasonable restraint.

then waited with bated breath, expecting to hear,
perhaps, of the Haussmanmsing of Sydney, or the
getting back of the powers now giv en to boards
and trusts into the hands of the elective council-
lors ; or, again, perhaps of the absorption of the
“common services,” gas arid electricity, trams,
ferry-boats, by the Council. “ What will you do

why I’ll have the streets swept and the wood-
blocks tarred,” replied the great ‘‘reform ” Mayor.

The tearful girl who doesn’t know why she
did it appeared the other day before Judge Hodges
in Melbourne, and Hodges, who evidently didn’t
know what on earth to do with her, finally gave
the beautiful, damp, interesting vision one month
in gaol. She had been a servant. She said she
was quite happy, and everybody treated her well,
and she had no animosity against anybody. All
the same, she admitted having set the house on
fire in nine different places at once, and made a
beautiful conflagration ; she couldn’t tell why she
did it —she simply did it. Five or six centuries
ago, when a girl was in this unaccountable
state, the law would have had her dislocated
by the proper official, by way of extracting a
clearer explanation, and on the general idea that a
witness was always more reliable when she was
dislocated. That process is out of date now, and
when the girl in the dock is a frantic and unac'
countable person, the law doesn’t even allow water
to be poured over her to make her more cool and
collected. So the girl who set the house on fire in
nine places and nearly charred the family got off
with a month, mainly because the law was so be-
wildered and driven off its head that it didn’t
know what else to do.
A Gippsland farmer, who was burnt out

pected person. Likewise he sent for the black
trackers, and the niggers were forwarded from

tion their verdict was : “ No man ; woman feller
tracks.” They unearthed the boot that had made
the tracks ; it was worn by the farmer’s 17-year-old
daughter, who admitted, under pressure, that she
had started the fire “ because she loved to see the
people excited, and the water-carts hurrying
about.” The farmer is now called upon to pay the

Artillery band, about 40 strong, playing a whole
half-dozen warriors up Oxford-street to church
every Sunday morning. ‘ Four-and-twenty men
and five-and-thirty pipers.’ Last time I saw them
the contingent numbered one officer, five men,
aiul a beltless prisoner, temporarily out of the
cells for the good of his soul. Comic opera was a
fool to it! ”

A Bulletin correspondent alleges that in
a country town, the other day. a stranger went
into the pound-keeper’s stable and stole his saddle.
He was arrested, tried by the pound-keeper him-
self and the local store-keeper— only other J.P.—
and fined 405., or a month. Then they sold his
horse for <£3, and told him to dear out. Well, it
was pretty good justice, but a bit irregular and
Jaypee-like.
* * * *
He couldn’t resist the temptation of help-
ing himself to half-a-dozen of the local J.P.’s
peaches, but the eye of the beak was down upon
him and a summons duly followed. The culprit—
a Government employe—was afraid he’d lose his
billet, so he got the local schoolmaster to intercede
for him, with the result that the beak consented
to cancel the summons on condition of receiving
A 5. Of course the man paid up. Thus a man
who is supposed to see the law administered
actually sucks blood-money from a working man
whom he has in his power.
* • * •
During a recent hot spell, a northern
N.S.W. town was much scandalised by the con-
duct of a J.P., who administered justice in his
bare feet and with very brief linen pants. In
fact, all that end of his washup which could be
seen underneath the desk was naked, and, for all
the litigants knew to the contrary, he had nothing
at all on except his coat. To the fellow who gets
three months, it doesn’t matter much whether his
washup is naked or not, but the legal profession
objected greatly to the J.P.’s feet, which were two
inartistic-looking masses of bare humanity hang-
ing underneath the desk.

Col. Gordon, S.A. military commandant,
lately returned from a year’s trip to England, and
the citizens breathe again. S.A. has an army of
only 200 men and two Maxim guns, so that Gor-
don and his huge moustache really constitute
S.A’s first line of defence. S.A. also has some
heavy guns, bought for several thousands during
a war-scare, which have long been rusting on
Glenelg beach. One of Gordon’s chief duties
when in England was to try and dispose of this
artillery, but, although S.A. Govt, was willing to
throw in Gordon and his moustache and the
Maxims to conclude the deal, nothing came of his
mission.

The numerousness of S. Australia’s J’sP.
may be accounted for by the manychanges of Minis-
try prior to Kingston’s accession. The only gift in
the power of an Australian Minister is a J.P.-ship,
which explains the fact that the average Adelaide
citizen dispenses justice in the court in the morn-
ing and runs an illicit totalizator in a barrel
down the alley in the afternoon.

Awhile ago an Australian Governor —who
is pious—visited an aboriginal mission station and
stayed there a few days. He rose at five o’clock
one morning to make a trip round the place, and
hearing a loud clatter in a certain building inno-
cently entered. It was the female dormitory, and
the native girls—as is their invariable habit —were
dancing and playing high jinks in a state of
nature. Whether lI.E. shut his eyes or put his
hands up to his face—the latter for obvious reasons
is preferable in such cases—is not recorded.
Dear Bulletin. —Re
your disparagement of the
patent-medicine man. Who,
when you have Bright's di-
sease or fatty degenera-
tion gives consolation
and brightens the out-
look ? The qualified
medico ? Not much ; he
leans to a purchase of
real estate, 6x2, or
words to that effect.
How different with the
Bolus Pill ! There, a
ream of testimonials
from patients with symp-
toms just like yours, or
worse, who all got well,
and whose chubby mugs
smile out of the pamph-
let assuringly. The
Lamp of Hope revives,
to burn undimmed
till the other quack
takes a hand with
his “ first - class
single” for the
Klondyke beyond
the stars, and his
present of the only
genuine latch-key
for the Gates of
Pf”trl.—H.F. [But then the
av rage doctor doesn’t lean
publicly to a purchase of real
estate. Generally he yells
hope in the ear of the dying
patient till hearing has de-
parted. —Ed. B.]

The constable in charge
of a Melb. suburban police-
station complains of being
wakened up at all hours by
drunks, asking their way
home—inquiring if the place
is a pub. wanting a match—
and so on ; the cause of the
sorrow being the lamp and
clock over the door. Yet,
why he should complain is
beyond understanding. Every
policeman wants promotion,
and his activity and intelli-
gence and fitness for promo-
tion are mostly judged by the
number of drunks and other
people that he arrests. And
here is a cop who hasn’t to go
out into the highways and
fight with his drunks and run
them in. The drunk flows
gently to his door all night
ready to be locked up—and
still he isn’t satisfied.

’Twas in the “ Hunters’ Contest” Mickey had a colt to ride,
Who’d jumped so well at home, you couldn’t stop him if you tried
’Twas not the fence that stopped him now, hut on the rails there leaned,
And all about the jump there stood, some photographic fiend.
But Micky held the brown colt straight, though in his heart he knew
’Twould need some luck to get him past that photographic crew;
Mick’s seat was firm and hands were low, as he came swooping down
With iron nerve and hard-set face upon the swerving brown.
Now, when they neared the water-jump, and heard the cameras “ click,”
Despite of coaxing—whip or spur—the colt would stop and kick;
When, notwithstanding Mickey’s skill, the colt had th us baulked twice,
A photo.-fiend stepped up to Mick, and offered ms advice.
And yet another one arose, and thus l heard him chide:
“ That moke can't jump! and I don’t think that you knowhow to ride!”
Said Mick, “ The ’orse can jump; and I’ve done all a man may do,
But—my ’orse wasn't foaled upon the field of- Waterloo! ’’

Dear Bulletin.— Re, the question of sex-
regulation - there would seem to be some connec-
tion between kangaroo-tail soup and fertility. In
Corowa, N.S.W., there lived, a few years back, a
widowed squatteress, whose pet aversion was
babies, and who would only engage childless mar-
ried couples. But, alas, her favorite family-dish
was kangaroo-tail soup, and, after about a year’s
residence at Corowa, the couples would be child-
less no longer. At length, however, the lady be-
thought her of an old couple, who had been
married in England 30 years before, and who had
no offspring. They were imported as soon as
. possible for service at Corowa ; but, alas ! in 15
months, the kangaroo-tail soup got in its fine
■ work, and the inevitable bantling arrived —with
the result to its parents of the ignominious sack.
Their place was taken by a still more antique
couple, whose ages aggregated 117 years, but
two years of the magic tail-soup regimen pro-
duced the usual effect in the shape of a lusty boy.
This was the last straw. The cherished luxury
was thenceforth sternly tabooed, and nobody was
ever allowed to bring a kangaroo within 10 miles
of the homestead, on pain of instant dismissal.
V 'th the soup went the continuous baby-produc-
tion, and the old lady was happy once more.—
Xob.

An Oriental gentleman informs The Bul-
letin that the sex-by-diet theory has long existed
in India. The intending parents keep apart for a
month, during which, if a boy is the desideratum,
the man half-starves himself, while the woman
fares of the best; while, if a girl is wanted, it is
the woman who fasts and the man who feasts.

Death. Smit.-Oil the 28th inst., Amy Jane Mary
Sniit., eldest daughter of John and William Smit, aged 1
day 2.J hours. The bereaved and heartbroken parents
- beg to tender their hearty thanks to Dr. Jones for his un-
remitting- attention during the illness of the deceased,
and for the moderate brevity of his bill. Also to Mrs.
M illiams for the loan of clean sheets, to Mr. Wilson for
running for the doctor, and to Mr. Robinson for recom-
mending mustard plaster.
A Q. police-sergeant Mas invented
an outrage on Sunday drinking. He
leaves the publican severely alone, but*
hauls up the drinker. Moreover, th©
local Bench backs him by fining thd
Sunday thirst-man £2—rather a top
price to pay for, say, a threepenny
drink. The cross-counter to this should
be to engage a hotel bed from Saturday
night till Monday morning, when the
engager becomes a “lodger,” entitled to
drench his inner reticulations to the full
extent of his desires.

Ten years ago the friendly societies

perhaps a lifetime of payments, because

Wherefore the genial, brotherly element

whilom brethren as a lot of wolves.”

valued admission at not less than fid. per

A pretty piece of police tactics was ex-
posed and denounced by Vic. County Court Judge
Gaunt, the other day. It came out in an appeal
against a Petty Sessions sentence of 12 months
for indecency. Accused, five months after
the alleged offence, had been identified by
three girls, but the evidence of two other girls
who witnessed the offence but failed to identify
was not brought forward. This was made the
ground of appeal. Judge Gaunt enquired, “ Why
were these girls not called in the lower court ?’
To which Crown-Prosecutor Walsh candidly re-
plied, “ Because they were unable to identify the
accused.” “Then,” said the Judge, “it was the
duty of the police to have called the girls.” Other
strong evidence was given in favor of appellant,
and the conviction was quashed.

N. : “I dropped into the Melb. Wesleyan
Conference to-day, just as they ballotted for
president. There are no nominations, but every
member votes for whom he likes, and it is regarded
as a test of popularity. Pastor Fitchett received
only one vote, doubtless from a sense of apprecia-
tion of the news that he has received <£soo for the
English edition of ‘Deeds that Won the Empire.’
The new president, one Grove, is a mild edition
of General Booth, and walked into the Secularisa-
tion of the Ministry, as far as he dared. But
Mr. Eitchett, with his ever-breadth of smile, is
an impossible eel to grasp. Why does he stand
so immeasurably head and shoulders above the lot
of them, able to dictate his own terms, and defy
all rule, even the itinerancy ? Not because he is
so great, but because they are so small.”
* * * «
Melb. : “In the Wesleyan Conference, to-
day, a pastor expressed the hope that his craft of
this denomination might never fall to the starva-
tion level of the C. of E. clergy. What does this
mean ? Archbishop Goe draws <£2ooo a year, in
addition to a large private income ; Dean Vance
about £lOOO, other benefices £BOO, £7OO, £6OO.
A number in Victoria run up to £5OO. Nay, all
the Vic. Anglican clerical wages clubbed together
give an average of £5 a week. Wherever can the
poverty come in ? It is well known that the rich
ministers are only too eager to dash to the relief
of the poor parsoness, whose little boy thrusts his
knee through his breeches when he kneels down to
pray. Therefore, Pastor Torrance’s proposal to
pool the incomes and divide up must be super-
fluous.”

Apropos the great bath controversy, Cairns
Post valorously maintains that 75 p.c. of the
everyday run of North Queenslanders do not in-
dulge in shower or plunge bath every morning.
Also, that 40 p.c. don’t even wash hands and face
before breakfast. Statistics, however, gleaned in
the neighborhood of Northern Mongrelia ought-
not to be taken as a basis for striking a Europea'
average.
CAUGHT IN THE SLIPS.
“ Where the treasure is there will the heart be also.”
THE REV. GENTLEMAN: “ Heah endeth the—ah—first
innings.”
From Maitland (N.S.W.) Mercury’s
solemn report of speech by one Rev. Bice, at last
meeting of Maitland Benevolent Asylum :
That this meeting- is quite in accord with the objects of
the Benevolent Society. . . . and trusts the Divine bless-
ing will continue to accompany its labors. When he
first came to town that institution was the first object
that caught his eye. . . . Not only that it was a valuable
one and well cared for, but from a distance it was a proud
and most beautiful object in the sight. . . . and inside,
the first thing that struck him was the matron herself.
. . . He had not in all his travels seen anything similar
to compare with the Asylum, and West Maitland ought
to be proud of that institution. ... He thought it would
be well if clergymen had something of the kind to look
forward to. . . . The Asylum itself showed it had come
to stay. . . . The balance-sheet made their hearts good
(!!!), and it was a great contrast to an institution he had
just left—the Australian Board of Missions—because it
could not pay his salary as secretary.
Two workmen lately fell from a hoist at
-t. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney, and the one who
wasn’t killed was taken to the hospital in a bad
state. As he wasn’t expected to live the in-
memoriam fiend got on the job promptly, and
presently a figure in seedy black called on the
poor, distracted wife, and remarked something to
the effect that the “ Lord gave and the Lord had
taken away.” Then he sniffed resignedly with a
damp, red nose, and asked if she would like to
order, say, three dozen of their beautiful memorial
card with a bit of poetry on it, and the name and
date of death. Presumably somebody buys that
black and leprous card with its slab of hymn
about the vacant chair, else the ghoul couldn’t
raise his bread and cheese, and his black suit
with the snail-tracks on it, and his spirituous
refreshment. But why anybody should buy it
and find comfort in it passes comprehension ; pro-
bably it is another branch of the emotion which
makes newly-married people go to the cemetery
on wet days and look at the epitaphs. And, some-
how, when the spectral card-seller comes round to
the house of mourning no one ever hears of the
dog being sooled on him. Perhaps no one has
sufficient energy, or possibly the animal is con-
fined in his kennel with a crape bow on his tail,
and isn’t available.

Fifteen men at one swoop is probably the
record for a sea breaking inboard of a vessel.
More correctly, ‘‘'seas”; for in the case of the
French four-masted barque President Faure, it
was the simultaneous tumbling in of seas to star-
board and port that robbed her in an instant of
three-fourths of her whole crew ! She was run-
ning 12 knots at the time, before a gale that made
it impossible to round to or lower a boat, even if
the loss had been known in time ; but the vessel’s
height of bulwarks kept the deck so long a lake
that by the time the state of the case was dis-
covered she had left the poor castaways miles
behind. Of the 15 unfortunates, the oldest,
melancholy to state, was only 34, and the youngest
16, and it is notable that in this case—as in that
of the s.s. Fiado, now overdue at Sydney—the
crew was exclusively French--mostly Bretons.
The “Dutchman” doesn’t get the footing any-
where else that he has made good in English
vessels.

“One who knows” writes to The Bulletin
from Perth, emphatically contradicting, from per-
sonal experience, the rumor that there is plenty of
employment to be had there. Boarding-house-
keepers, it is stated, are the only people who are
doing well, and the invariable answer to appli-
cants for work is that hands are being turned off for
the want of it. There are numbers there already
for whom there is no employment. The shipping
and boarding-house people, it is further alleged,
make a point of concealing, in their own interests,
the real state of the case, and a ruinous state of
things, it is predicted, must result from a continua-
tion of the population-flow westwards.

Anyone who would get an idea of the
jolly-and-fat conditions prevalent in Sydney,
should walk through the main streets at any time
between midnight and 4 a.m. City shopkeepers
place boxes of rubbish on the-kerb last thing at
night, ready for the morning scavenger, but said
scavenger is anticipated by the horde of homeless
and hungry wretches who slink out of the dark-
ness to ransack the boxes for anything edible (?)
they may contain. The writer has seen a mangy
dog and one of Sydney’s night-haunting goats
driven away from a noisome George-st. rubbish-
box by a reputed man for the sake of a crust the
cur had previously nosed and contemptuously
rejected. And though he has walked also the
nocturnal streets of Melbourne and other cities,
the writer has never (perhaps times were then
better) observed the ghostly rubbish-fossicker out-
side the “ jolly-and-fat ” metropolis of N.S. W.

Once more the question—“ How much
fine equals how much gaol?” Brisbane (Q.)
Central Police-court tally, taken in order of daily
paper’s report, for last day of Feb. ult. : By
Papa Pinnock, P.M. —Male chronic drunk, £2 or
14 days ; ditto, ditto ; female ditto, £2 or 7 days;
male ditto, £2 or 48 hours (!); drunk while in
charge of a horse and cab, £2 or 7 days; cruelty
to a horse, £2 or 7 days ; petty larceny, ill or 1
month (! !); obscene language, £2 or 48 hours (!).
Same day, G. P. M. Murray, P.M., dismissed
a complaint with £2 12s. costs or 21 days. Same
day,-by W. Yaldwyn, P.M.—Obscene language,
£2 or 15 days. Therefore—ill fine equals 1
month’s imprisonment; £2 fine equals 48 hours,
equals 7 days, equals 14 days, equals 15 days : £2
12s. costs equals 15 days. And this illogical, bile-
varying mix-up occurs practically every day,
everywhere ! ” '

Sydney Evening News makes fewer mis-
takes than most Australian papers in the ampli-
fication of cables. For instance, the Sydney morning
papers the other day received a message which
read “Royal attendedLedeum Cathedral, Athens,”
and both Herald and Telegraph translated to
the effect that the Royal Family of Greece had
attended the Ledeum Cathedral, at Athens. The
Evening News man, however, rendered it as an
attendance by the Royal Family at a Te Deuifi
at the Cathedral, at Athens, which was, of course,
correct. Again : Some months ago a cable curtly
stated “Obituary Edwards.” There were six
possible Edwardses in the the reference books.
The News cable editor looked up their biographies,
and selected the one with an Australian connec-
tion, and so “killed” the right man. • S.M.
Herald, D. Telegraph, Melb. Argus,, Mell>.
Age and S.A. Register, each slew a wrong
Edwards, and so between these six papers five live
Edwardes were gathered to their fathers.

The male jurors agreed to a verdict of not guilty.
But the women would not hear of it, and it Was

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 8, 1898.
mt Hear Myek—
The fluttering'coat-tails of a flock of clergy—as-
sembled to greet the arriving Ormuz, with their
head-man Smith and family on board—blackened
the Quay as if a crow convention had settled there.
The Primate’s chastened greeting included a re-
mark on his flock’s goodness in being there “ so
early,” and elevated the meeting to the rank of a
sacrifice ; each solemn sin-eraser felt that he had
scored with the Recording Angel by giving up his
early morning sleep to greet his chief betimes.
Among the passengers were a couple, to meet whom,
Btrangely enough, no one attended from Govt.

has Lady Clarke 11., and other dressy
persons, but it will be months ere the new
draggly folds will flop from the hips of Sydney
womankind. A dress-expert told me the other
day that her frocks “ to arrive” will all be petti-
coated thus. Her dresses are not made on the
wearer, but imported ready-built from ’Oine. A
rough model of this latest skirt is a tablecloth with
a hole out in the middle for the waist, and four
corners snipped off; and if the wearer looks as if
she were shut up inside a vast umbrella, she will
have the comforting reflection of knowing that she
is the Right thing.
The tall form of Speaker Abbott was seen in
town last week as he came up from the Convention
in the South to his daughter’s wedding. Miss
Abbott was married on Wednesday, 2nd, to Mr.
Norman Simpson, of Ban-aba. At first the
church (St. Thomas’s, North Sydney) was going
to be unflowered, as the bridal fell in Lent, when
it is considered sinful to jubilate florally in high
church circles; but, after a spasm or two, the
greenery was allowed. (I wonder if ritualistic
persons really think that the Almighty sits aloft
on the watch and dots a black mark against the
same of every sinner who carries a bit of colored
vegetable into church at the wrong time?) Miss
Abbott’s gown was notable for some high-priced
lace and also for much chiffon which veiled all.
There were four bridesmaids in white and yellow,
» favorite wedding-color combination since the
vice-regal followers wore it last year.
A feature of the recent Josephson-Grimshaw
wedding was a song while the register was being
signed. Miss Pedley sang to an organ accompani-
ment, and as this is the first time she has sung
since her recent long and dangerous illness, every-
body was glad to hear her.
At a swagger wedding lately, the families were
doing their best to keep the ceremony select, and
none but the Naicest were invited. And every-
body connected with the ceremony was so much
annoyed when alarge, irrepressible lady who writes
came and took it all down in her little note-book
and made copy of it.
All the old-fashioneu notions about divorce
being a painful process, about as abrupt and jerky
as having a double-tooth drawn, are quite obsolete.
The new pjtinless method applies the anaesthetio
of good feeling to the raw wound of severance, and
divorcer, divorcee and TertiumQuid are all on the
best of terms. The latest sign of good manners
was exhibited at a recent re-marriage of a lady
whose husband had successfully applied to a kindly
judge and jury to cut the matrimonial knot. She
married the other man, and, just to show that
there was no animosity, husband the first gave a
glittering wedding-present. And all three were
quite content, though it did look as if the deceived
No. 1 were giving his wife away '*r 4 -s % bonus to
the first customer that offered.
The committee ladies who chooe the prizes gi ven
to the Alfred Hospital nurses at the recent swagger
annual meeting, didn’t allow their literary tastes
to riot in unbeaten tracks in selecting the gift-
books. Out of a baker’s dozen of volumes, six
were Tennyson—always a safe card to play—and
the other seven included the bald abruptness of a
dictionary, the religious eroticism of Franees R.
Havergal, and the soaring poetic flight of Shelley.
It must be a very catholic taste that marks with
equal eye Havergal and Shelley.
At the great door-struggle of tne first Albani
concert in Sydney, the fighters trying to force
their way to the pay-hole were supposed to be
superior persons of cultured musical taste, who
would snort disdainfully at being compared to a
first-night crowd at a sixpenny gallery door. All
the same, they pushed and struggled and grabbed
hair and clothing off each other, and were as
aggressive as any li push ” could be. One girl
snatched at a man’s neck in her excitement, and,
in her absorption, didn’t discover for some time
that she was holding in her hand the mans collar,
which she had wrenched off the astonished vic-
tim. On the day after the final sing-song the
hall-keeper ranged up in a corner a whole array of
wrecked umbrellas. Probably the gamps were
taken out to bang the floor in applause, for a sun-
shade at night, if there’s no sign of rain, is a use-
less appendage. But there’s a type of woman who
never sets foot out of doors minus a brolly.
So many toney persons are announcing their
approaching departure for ’Ome that soon there
will be no Nice people left in the city of the beau-
tiful ’arbor, except the absentees, as Paddy would
say. And the woman of to-day has her own send-
off, and speechifies thereat, and the papers report
her words just like a man. Woollahra House will
shortly be empty, when the Paston-Cooper family
depart, after two years’ sojourn here. At Pad-
dington Barracks Lady Cooper, who has played
patroness to the wives of the men who play
soldiers at that millingtary centre, was farewelled
by the Soldiers’ Wives’ League, and, in present-
ing Mrs. Tommy Atkins collectively with the
highly practical parting-gift of a sewing-machine,
she made a neat, gracefully-worded speech with-
out notes, also without hesitation. Another
recent send-off was given by the same local
“ League ’’—when two or three are gathered
together now it’s always a “ League ” when it
isn’t a “Guild”—at Moss Vale, to Mrs. Chris.
Bennett, of the Evkxoose, who, with her family,
trips ’Ome for two years. Local magnates
gathered in force, and donated an album of views
to the lady.
Electric search-lights at fancy-fairs are some-
times as disastrous as flash-light photos, of first-
night crowds in their revelations of hidden cir-
cumstances. There was one thrown on a festive
function in a southern city a little while ago. The
flash.lighted up an obscure garden-seat, and the
features of a frisky, young and highly-placed
matron sitting thereon and partially obscuring the
waistcoat of a friend who happened to bo there
also. The lady and her husband have since bidden
a farewell to Australia, and now some scandal-
mongers are shaking their heads because along
with their names in the listof passengers permail-
steamer the name of the flash-light friend happens
again.
As far as the house was eonosrned, Monday
night, at Her Majesty’s, was an overflowing
meeting. Stalls were full-dressed even to the
ninth or tenth row, and the d.c. was par-
ticularly gorgeous. Glasses were eagerly focussed
on Maud Jeffries on her entrance, and there was
no disappointment in the verdict on the new
beauty. She recalls Maxine Elliott, but, being
more vivacious than that rather stolid Venus,
ought to have more drawing power. Also, she
has soul pieieing eyes and a dot-and-carry-one
walk. Her best blue gown was a symphony in
tucks and side-skirt pleatings. It took the
audience some time to become used to the new-
comers’ voices. It’s in hearing a complete Eng-
lish co. after an Australian one that the difference
between the accents is felt by the ear. English
voices wrecked by wear-and-tear in fog and east
winds soon become husky and worn, but the accent
remains refined and rather affected in the ears of
the folk who talk Australian and glory in their
indolent way of using their strong, well-formed
vocal organs. Music effects in the “Manxman”
are artistically manage i by the orchestra, headed
by conductor Caron ; the incidental tunes are
high-toned selections from Wagner and Schubert,
and old-world unhackneyed Irish songs.
When a N.S. W. Woman’s Mutual Help Society
was recently preparing for a dance in aid of the
funds, they had a large, enamelled bucket filled
with materials for a mighty fruit salad—about -£1
worth of grapes, bananas, pine-apples, peaches,
and cream—when in came a member who sports
B.A. after her name. She was asked to kindly
clear away the fruit-skins, &c., while the others
proceeded with the salad, whereupon she grabbed
the bucket and promptly upset the whole caboodle
into the street.
One of the Government creditors of even date is
a bewildered undertaker with a long bill for an
interment, which the department interested won’t
foot because the burial hasn’t yet come off. An
aged patient in one of the charity-barracks was
sinking fast, and a kindly attendant rang up the
sick man’s only known relative to come out that
afternoon, as the old man was dying. The wires
by chance were crossed and a city undertaker re-
ceived the message, and that afternoon the coffin-
seller arrived with all the panoply of a pompous
funeral. Meanwhile the patient rallied amazingly,
and the undertaker claims compensation for time,
labor, and vehicles supplied, while the department
naturally objects to pay for a funeral which never
happened.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ At times the Austral Salon could tear its hair
over the scarcity of would-be hostesses. But
when the Club throws open its doors to dis-
tinguished guests, competition is keen for the
honor of feeding the lions. No less than 22
‘ hospitallers ’ went snacks in paying for the tea
and cake provided t’other afternoon for the Wilson
Barrett reception. And the co-operative bread
cast upon the waters yielded prompt profits arid
quick returns. For one thing, the hostesses- of
course with their sisters, cousins, aunts, and
chums—get the run of the Holy of Holies inside
the ribbons, which barred off the mere mass of
adherents from the immediate presence of the
Idols of the Hour.
“ First of the guests to arrive was W.B. himself,
wearing, amongst other things, a turned-down
collar, while his bright brown curls haloed the
rim of a bell-topper. Up to now, none of his own
chicks had appeared, and there was hardly another
man on the premises. So the sensitive creature
took fright. May-be it was the bristling phalanx
of brilliant hats (many of them bought for his
express benefit) that took his breath away. Any-
how, he renounced the soft delights of cushioned
ctiairs, flowers, and suchlike accumulated on his
behalf, and went and sat behind the curtain on a
packing-case. Later on, when he had lots of com-
pany in distress, he came out, crisped up, and
made an elegant speech, in the course of which he
made so bold as to tell his hearers they looked
most charming and beautiful ‘ in the mass.’
“ Maude Jeffries came late, having strayed away
en route in lifts and trams. fcUie looked as nice a
girl as ever lived, but that day one sympathised
with critics who accuse her of ‘untidiness.’ Her
black accordeon-pleated skirt and blue chiffon
sleeves bad seen their best days, and her waist and
hip tactics were purely hygienic. A top-heavy
black hat, clustered with pink roses, could not
hide the sad fact that the winsome little curls and
spontaneous tress tendrils of stage coiffures tend
to straggling locks for street wear. Cheerful,
flaxen-haired Daisy Belmore came along in an un-
pretending white frock and sailor hat; while
spectacled ‘Spider’ Percyval looked darker arid
more academic than on the stage. Manning, voted
‘ the beauty of the bunch,’ fell with a crash from
feminine favor owing to the appearance of Cecilia
Wilman in her unsuspected role of ‘Mrs. Manning.’
When the Clarendon people had done their time
at the revels, they straggled off the premises as
they had come in ones and twos, and drifted down
street on shanks’ pony, while Harry Rickards anil
daughter Noni departed in a brougham manned
by green liveries.
“The Salon programmers a whole, wasn’t a
howling success. Probably performers were ner-
vous. One member eloeuted a ‘Wild West’
sketch, with menagerie imitations, but yelling
Indians and chirping crickets expressed themselves
unconvincingly through the mouthpiece of a pal-
pitating amateur.
“ Lady Brassey’s ‘at home,’ to bid her lively
step-daughter and meek stepson-in-law farewell,
was just a gathering of the very Nicest with a
slight leaven of political bigwiguery. Evidently
the idea was to send off the F.T.’s with flying
colors, and a splash of bawbees w-as intended to
blot out some previous records of cheese paring.
P.p.c. cards swelled into booklets tied up with
gold cord, and emblazoned with the family
initials and the years of arrival and departure.
Inside were v ignettes of the departing pair and of
the son and heir, while bathos was reached with
Byron's lines, ‘ Fare thee well: and, if for ever ’
&o. The fixings of the shivoo itself turned out to
be quite as smart as the invitation-cards. One-
half the ballroom was given up to the dancers, the
other was furnished, and there Uncle Tom and
hostess wandered about receiving their dear
friends, who, for this occasion only were all ad-
mitted at the main entrance, and directed by a
posse of servants through the drawing-room into
the dancing chamber. Light and casual refresh-
ment paved the way for a sumptuous sit-down
supper. In the ballroom the dancing half was
void of decoration, beyond palms and small tables
devoted to display of silverware, signed por-
traits of ‘ duchesses,’bowls of flowers, &c., which
were pretty often on the verge of destruction hv
soineunwary Augustus orother who had tripped hi-
generous feet over the Turkish rugs. The garden
was much patronised, but the colored electric
lights made things more picturesque than pleasant
for several couples. Interesting tableaux were
plainly visible, although he and she had taken
themselves to what they reckoned was a dark
corner. In at least one instance the lady was not
free, and hubby, amongst the guests, might have
taken note —several notes, in fact—of how a mas-
culine coat-sleeve shows up against a light-satin
dress. Diamonds were as plentiful as blackberries.
Lady Brassey, looking very thin and pale, sported
black with a white bodice having a black top
secured to the waist by straps of jet. A brush-
like aigrette waved above a diamond ornament
in the hair, and plenty more of the same stones
flashed from neck and corsage. Mrs. F. T. faced
the light in a very up-to-date garment of pale-
grey satin, with crossing bands of cream lace on
the bodice fastened down by carbons; diamond
tiara and ornaments ad lib.
The lately-returned wife of Surgeon Ryan also
sported pale grey, but fixed things up becomingly
by covering the corsage with pale-green fly-net
streaked with silver spangles. A lately - re-
turned globe-trotter, Mrs. George Chirnside, was
another devotee tqgrey, while Mrs.-Percy* hirnside
of that ilk sported black very much embroidered.
The point about Mrs. Percy C. was the fashion in
which her golden ’air was twisted upon top and la
Ch inee, and surmounted by a structure of dia-
monds. A prospective bride cut a tip-top figure
in pale-blue with many sequins ; and Miss Clara
Manning held her owe in white with dressings of
pale-green. Baronet Clarke’s spouse, who has
shed her mourning to some purpose, seemed to
have come in the character of an animated cab-
bage besprinkled with dew-drops on the outside
leaves. Her waving skirts in the dance revealed
green supports, or stems, amid clouds of pink
mysteries. Mrs. Edward Miller was imposing in
yellow satin and diamonds ; and Mrs. Albert
Miller, as usual, was resplendent in pickle-cabbage
pink hung with black lace. Hon. Rupert Caring-
ton’s wife failed to ‘ fetch ’em ’ in a nondescript
white-and-black garb with a splash of red. Pro-
ceedings wound up with a cotillion, in the course
of which the performers were seen gyrating round
a maypole at the loose ends of colored ribbons led
by Captain and Mrs. F.T., or being driven team-
fashion down the room in a polka by the same
energetic couple, the Captain driving ‘ faymales ’
while his lady acted as whip to the baser sex. A
doll-baby figured prominently another time. It
was somewhat pitiable to behold the sedate
johnny whirling round with this effigy as his only
partner, and equally sad to witness some curled
darlings of society with jockey-caps and whips
sprinting down the room on hobby horses to
secure partners. The last figure, from the dancers’
point of view, was the ‘ Souvenir,’ in which they
received gifts decorated with portraits of the
departing pair.
“ The allurement of association with Lcrd
Brassey only drew one Federal delegate to the
ceremony of opening the new Melb. Salvation
Army maternity home. The official programme
provided fora ‘call upon one of the Premiers or
the leader of the Convention to speak for five
minutes.’ But there was no Premier or no leader
present, and although the Army had hired four
big four-horse drags to convey the delegates, Dr.
Cockburn was the only one who turned up ! It
was probably this disconcerting circumstance that
led Commandant Booth to forget the Governor’s
name and call him ‘Lord—er—inn—Aberdeen,’
much to the annoyance of the Old Man of the Sea,
who looked daggers.
“The first Albani concert at Melb. Town Hall
was rather overburdened with ‘ Gorsave.’ When
His Ex. and party arrived, late as u-ual, the audi-
ence found itself expected to stand and look re-
ligious, whilst Benito Scherek pounded a whole
verse of Hanthem from the awful organ. And
again, at about 10.50 p.m., the panting Diva and
her three assistant vocalists tightened the Silken
Bonds with a full-length rendering of the same
1 ideous chestnut. The Hanthem was not being
given ‘by general request,’ as far as one could
judge from the general countenance. Even Gov.
Brassey wore a troubled expression, and the de-
jected haviour of Sec. Lord Neville’s wan visage
might very well have moved the singers to cut it a
little shorter. Lord Neville is too sad for words,
these times, and he makes matters worse by affect-
ing yellow coat-facings about two shades brighter
than an attack of jaundice.
“ All doubt as to the identity of the floral offer-
ing that had the vice regal pasteboard attached
was set at rest when Albani came bounding back
to the platform to sing her first encore number.
She had evidently picked out the Brassey bouquet,
which she brandished in the direction of her dear
hostess, as though it were a precious compliment
indeed. Now, considering the many thousands of
bunches of garden produce sacrificed at the altar
of an Albani during, say, 2o years, this warm
display of enthusiasm over the Brassey posey must
be set down as the most artistic item in Saturday’s
performance.
“ The retirement of the well-beloved Mr. F. W.
Haddon, after 31 years’ continuous occupation of
the Ano US editorial chair was signalised by a big
and enthusiastic Argus shivoo, at Melb.'Town
Hall, last Saturday. The antiquity of the con-
servative organ was shown by the dates of some
of the people associated with it, publisher
Ebbsworth harking back to 1300, and the still-
youthful looking accountant to 1851. Howard
Willoughby (the new editor), Mr. Haddon him-
self, and Mr. E. S. Cunningham (the new ‘ news’
editor were the only speakers, apart from proprie-
tors Maokinnon and Spowers, who conveyed the
cheerful intimation that at no time of its career
had the Argus been in a more prosperous condi-
tion.
“On Steeplechase day the vice-regal pen looked
pretty dull without the Governor’s crisp married
daughter, who left for ’Ome last Tuesday with
hubby and small bov. Quantities of farewell
flowers were sent to her on the China, and they
kept on arriving for so long that at last the steamer
officials wouldn't allow another messenger aboard
Lady Constance and Mr. Combe sailed per same
boat, also cyclist Barden, a bishop, and other more
or less well-known people.
Lady Brassey saw the Steeplechase in that
hardened green toque of hers and a magpie mix-
ture of black silk and white chiffon.
“Aide Neville, in mourning for his sister,
even ln ore fragile than usual. Capt.
vyallington, on the other hand, is palpably
plumper. Probably the early hours, regular
family life, and constant family prayers at S.A.
Covt. House suit his constitution. Duncan
Gil ies, too, gets no thinner. As he escorted some
rather frumpish female constituents over the
lawns, his collar was regularly cutting into the
back of his well-nourished head.
The engaged Miss Madden trod her native
heath once more in blue-striped silk and hat
crested with cerise geraniums. She and pretty
sister Ruby have come back with their tresses
trained sheer to the top, where the ultimate
arrangement is shrouded in the crown of a small
round hat. *1 he combed-up hair at the back and
sides is very little waved. Soon, very likely, we
will all be Japanese as to coiffure, as of yore. The
younger wanderer had her frock cut rather low in
the neck, then a narrow strip of lace was fastened
innocently at the throat with a small brooch. A
waist-buckle as broad as the wearer enlivened the
back view of her bodice.
“ Local Shakespearean enthusiasts still bark
and bite at the memory of Wilson Barrett’s
Hamlet and Othello. Nevertheless, in the latter
role, he made a fairly fascinating fire-eater, just
tawny enough to indulge in snowy robes, crimson
mantles, gold helmets, and Oriental gems, with
pleasing spectacular results. For all his good
looks, Wilson Barrett, with his face washed, has
no eyes worth mentioning. Of course, his peep-
holes perform their principal purpose in life all
r 'ght, ‘ good enough to see with, my dear! ’ But
that s all we can say for them. However, Othello’s
complexion—capable even of throwing John Cole-
man s narrow orbs into prominence—completely
counteracts W. B.’s optical short-comings, thereby
adding an extra string to his lady-killing bow.
“ So far as looks go, Maud Jeffries was never
more delightful than as Desdemona. As the
Commandant’s lady pleading for alcoholic
Cassio, she wears her low-necked white chiffon
robe, a green - and - gold bolero and gorgeous
Damascene girdle. Long strings of coral beads
encircle her neck ; red, pink and creamy roses
nestle in her dark flowing curls ; and she herself
glows like some tropical blossom. Later, with
the honeymoon over, and her ‘old man’ con-
victed of chronic bad-temper, she sits wrapped in
pale-blue pelisse over an underdress of white
muslin awaiting with well-founded misgivings the
home-coming of her Ethiopian. ‘ Forewarned is
forearmed, and with such clearsighted forebodings
it made one angry to see the victim sit still and
be murdered. Sympathetic Emilia under the bed,
with instructions to scream if the worst came to
the worst, and a few lap-dogs and alarm-bells at
hand to raise a riot if necessary, might have saved
the situation.
“But, perhaps, Shakespeare knew best. It’s a
difficult matter to decide on the exact moment to
let appearances go hang. Emily Mather (Deem-
ing’s victim), for instance, as shown by the evi-
dence at her murderer’s trial, had been seen hi the
yard of their villa wringing her hands, a picture
of abject terror, probably on the very day of her
death. Yet when a passer-by asked what was the
matter, the fugitive smiled and went mdoors
again to dree her weird.
“Desdemona was too pretty a woman not to
meet with a good deal of sympathy from the
audience. An Insolvency Court Judge had
brought his flock of small girls as usual, and
didn t those poor kiddies soak their little ’ker-
chiefs ! Their grief recalled a former night when
they nearly washed their sleepy eyes out be-
moaning the wrongs of the ‘Sign of the Cross’
martyrs. An advertising doctor and his wife
also came with a small boy. A string of weirdly-
dressed infants would bob at the heels of some
parents, I do believe, if they got tickets f or an
execution to-morrow morning.
“ Daisy Belmore, with violets all over her hat,
saw her colleagues’ farewell performance from the
back of the cl.c. Rose Mtisgrove was somewhere
about, too, in a pale-grey frock befrilled with
briglit-blue chiffon. That dashing society belle,
Miss May Wilson, in white brocade and green
velvet, with her fiance, Mr. Ernest Raleigh, and
others, looked her last on Virginius from the
Governor’s box. Maud Jeffries got heaps of
flowers. W.B., in his white muslin Roman robes,
made a speech, was mobbed at the stage-door by
women, and hunted to Ins hotel by a waggonette
of girls. These gay Dianas, so they say, were
rewarded by a parting address all to themselves
from their quarry as he stood on an upper landing
at Mcnzies’ with a bedroom candlestick clasped in
his trembling hand.
Yours faithfully,
CLEO.
At Mt. Gam bier, Vic., the other day a
blacksmith suicided in his shop by hanging him-
self to a rafter, having first lit a large fire on the
dirt floor directly under the spot. When he was
found, the greater part of his body was burnt to a
cinder, and the upper half still hung from the
rafter. A religious crank, surely, trying to break*
sheol gently.
A Melbourne policeman lately captured
a small, husky, eute-looking boy, named David
Solomon, on a charge of larceny, and started in-
quiring into his antecedents. David proved to
have a Scotch mother and a Hebrew father, and
his religion, he said, was “’arf and-’arf,” pre-
sumably half Presbyterian and half synagogue.
This shows a new danger ahead. The man who
finally owns the earth will be named Donald
McMoses, or Alexawilder Cohen, or something
like that. When the Jew and the Scotchman be-
come one composite race, with the large, glossy
beak of Cohen above the whisky breath and the
kilt of Donald, and that new race charges
humanity in general with its claymore in one hand
and its p.n. in the other, then humanity in general
will be routed with great slaughter.

In N.Q., not very long ago,
the D.C. Judge on circuit dined
heavdy over-night, and afterwards
taught some real lydies how to
dance “ Ta-ra-ra boom-de-ay ”
then prevalent. Next morning,
when the hour for opening court
arrived, his Honor was not out of
bed, and sent word to the old
bailiff who acted as clerk, to pub
the clock back 10 minutes. VV hen
the timepiece recovered her lost
ground, the bailiff came out on
the court-house verandah, where
he had a good view of the Judge’s
pub., and, seeing no appearance,
he mounted a chair and shoved
the big hand back another lOmin.
He went through this performance
thrice ere the Judge turned up
and opened court at “ ten o’clock
sharp.” The feelings and remarks
of 60 jurymen, many of whom n'ad ridden 20
miles on horseback that morning to attend the
court, can be dimly guessed at.
In personal appearance the James Service
of to-day is remarkably like his father, Richard

old gentleman who differed from his son in poli-
tics, ran a little weekly sheet, the name of which
the writer forgets ; he was his own publisher and
newsrunner, collector, and advercising-agent.

Tr ? e T v ’ Bob Knopwood, first chaplain of the

complained of the injustice of a sentence, Knop-

P. Durack, who pegged out his claim in
eternity at Perth (W.A.), some weeks ago, was
the pioneer who opened up the Cooper country
round Wmdorah (Q.). In the sixties he over-
Janded thither from Goulburn (N.S.W.) and
settled on dhylungra station. In recent years,
somewhat cramped in fortune, Durack took up
large areas in Westralia, and once more accumu-
lated wealth.
John Norton should bulk largely in the
history of Sydney City Council during the next
few years. The Question is—Will he transform
the Council’ or will it transform him? One can
hardly imagine the pugnacious and purposeful
political pigmy (how easily alliteration associates
itself with the subject) whittled down to the calm
kerb-and-gutter level, and heaving in front of
him the orthodox aldermanio stomach.

“ In answer to Alex. M., re the lizard, com-
monly known as the iguana, or goanna, the Aus-
tralian Museum natural history department has
adopted the popular name ‘ goanna,’and has, I
think, so labelled some specimens on view there at
present. Goanna is certainly not aboriginal; it is
only a corruption of iguana. But, as Alex. M.
says, the lizard in question is not an iguana at all,
so the name goanna, being distinctive, is to be
taken as original and adopted, although for some
time those who use it may expect to be accused of
illiteracy. The correct name, I believe, is ‘lace-
lizard.’ E.F.

Dear Bulletin, —There was another case
of Lynch law in N.Q., before Normanton was the

Burketown. A negro cook at the only hotel was
charged with stealing nuggets, dust, photos, &c.
A suspended camp-oven-was banged with the
back of an axe to collect the boys. The boys
rolled up. The negro had a camphor-wood chest
—a .rare article then up that way, but he hhd
come round by steamer, and had been a sea-cook.
He refused to give up his keys. “Daddy ” ordered
the chest to be split open. The lost goods were
found. As in the Cloncurry case, a jury was em-
pannelled, the negro being allowed right of chal-
lenge. Found guilty. Also found that he had no

J.M.L. : Last summer, padding the
hoof along the Southern line with a fox-terrier
slut and two pups, which latter I carried in a

I and the slut went down for a swim, leaving the
pups on the ground with the swag. When igo
back a big diamond snake had swallowed one pup
and had started on t’other. I killed the reptile
and chopped the puppy out, much scared but
otherwise O.K. That pup I sold to a cocky later
on as a prize pup, being, I solemnly swore, out of

again this year and he told me this : The pup
grew up all right, but had always a slippery,
wriggly way with him and would swallow steaks
and 8 chops without chewing them. They missed
him at the beginning of the winter and never laid
eyes on him till spring, when one day the cocky
saw a strange-looking thing creeping out of a
hollow tog. It was the pup. He had slept the
winter through like a snake.

who finds an effectual cure for bunged-eye. The

and I’ve also jammed a half-a-plug into the eye

just the same. “ Tweed-Riyer-J’s ” hot water
fomentation, as well as cold water linseed,- bread-
poultice, mashed potatoes, dough, raw steak, and
all manner of eye-waters also failed. Being a
particular favorite of the mysterious insect, I ve
tried nearly every so-called remedy without suc-
cess. Doctors I have consulted have coolly ad-
vised me “to wait till the eye went down again
on its own,” as they knew of no other remedy^
Be the flv itself, / have seen and felt A.R. B.D s
fly bite my hands and arms. The bite resembled
the quick prick of a needle. But the place never
swelled, nor itched. You never see the bunging-
insect settle on or leave your eye, and never feel
the actual bite. Sometimes I doubt whether
the whole biz is caused by a fly or other insect at
all. In cultivation districts the pest is far worse
than elsewhere. Harvest fields are the places to
look for bimged-eyes. Out back on the Darling,
Paroo, Warrego, and N.W. border of Queensland,
where’ ordinary flies swarm, there is very little
bung-eye.-R.lt., Narandera.

Who says the days of “lambing-down”
are done? T’other day at Bunclaberg (Q.) the
cook of a labor-vessel took up his quarters at a
certain hotel and handed his cash (£4B) to the
publican for safe keeping. At the end of a riotous
six days the joyous Bacchanalian was informed
that his money was “done.” According to evi-
dence for defence the plaintiff (for naturally afore-
said cook kicked up a rumpus and appealed to the
law) had shouted expensive liquors for all and
sundry ; had given the barmaid the price of a new
dress—to say nothing of a beautiful ring and
other trifles. Also, at the close of every day. (de-
fendant admitted with truly charming simplicity)
the price of champagne shouted was duly de-
ducted from plaintiff’s little deposit—and all
around was lush, fresh additions to the till, and
general joy in the House of Bung ! Wherefore
it will be easily seen that that .£4B must have
dwindled down very low in tie course of six days.
An unsympathetic Bench, however, gave a verdict
for some 12 guineas in favor of plaintiff—to say
nothing of multitudinous costs —and a shout of
virtuous triumph rent the boozy welkin.

Way back in the “ sixties, ” around a station
near Breeza, the plains for miles were covered
with what are known as “ rolly-poleys,” and the
crows were in swarms. When shearing was over,
two young fellows—lrishman “Big Mick” and
Englishman Harry—set out on foot for Breeza
station. They had two water-bags, but both were
emptied by the time they got within 20 miles of
Breeza, and “Big Mick” was utterly “done.”
His mate induced him to pull off his boots and
make one more effort, but he dropped again at 15
miles. Harry then left him, and made all haste
to the nearest house he knew to get a quart
of water ; found the place deserted, and, crawling
on hands and knees, made for the well. The
bucket and rope were gone, so he tore off his shirt,
made a rope, tied the quart to it, and drank till
ho could drink no more. Then he started back
for his mate with a single quart, got two miles,
stumbled with exhaustion, and spilt the water.
Back he went again—refilled, made another start,
and this time reached Mick, but found him dead,
with Ins eyes already picked out. —F.C.K.

The farewell supper given to artist Percy
Spence— whose portrait is printed herewith—by his
friends and brother artists was presided over by
the versatile ex-Premier Dibbs. In the course of
the speech in which he proposed the health ot the
guest of the evening, the burly ex-politician
denied any pretensions to the dignity ot art-
critic. He was simply an art-lover, and as such
he admired Mr. Spence both as a man and as an
artist, and deeply regretted the lack of pubho
encouragement which made it necessary tor so
cultured an exponent of Australian art to leave
them for the old country, where, however, he
hoped Mr. Spence would stay till he topped
the tree. Incidentally, the chairman remarked
that the victim of the valedictory effusion
had recently painted a portrait of Mrs. Ibbbs,
which, in his (the speaker’s) opinion, could literally
speak. The chairman concluded his speech with

Do you ever have a headache ? Would
you not have a cure—simple, harmless, effective,
of trifling cost, and occupying ho more space than
a thimble ? Then, write or call on Newman and
Snelson (chemists to Lord Hampden), King-
street, Sydney. They have discovered a specific
which instantly relieves a headache of any origin,
and which never produces any of the injurious
after-effects so common with other headache cures.
The new cure is put up in packets of ten tablets—

J.M. : If, as you say, the Chow often pays his
-£lOO poll-tax to some alleged authority in Hongkong or
elsewhere before leaving China, and then is gaoled in Aus-
tralia for not paying, the most natural inference seems
to be that the man who collects the £lOO at Hongkong is
an impostor and an Atmospheric Gas Senex : You
don’t merely joke with difficulty ; you joke with impossi-
bility H.P.B. : As it happens, land-value taxation
began in Australia before George's time, and it began in
England and elsewhere centuries before George, so the
man who assumes that Ballance, Seddon, and others must
have got their ideas from George is an ignorant idolator.
Moreover, quite a number of valuable reforms were never
even suggested by George—State Life Insurance, for in-
stance . Jemmy-up-a-Tree : Can’t give you space to

began. So were dozens of other places. Eng-
land had it centuries before George was born. India
had it long before his time. Vic., Queensland, S.A. and
M.L. all had it for Local Govt, purposes when he was un-
heard of. The countries which had land taxation before
George’s time still have it, and cranks like you now ask
the world to believe that George is the cause of them
having it.
“SUBPLUS.”
The term ‘‘surplus ” is applied, in life insurance
affairs, to the balance, ascertained periodically,
between the assets and the liabilities. Out of this
balance or surplus, distributions of profits are
made to the policy-holders entitled to participate.
The natural tendency of distribution is to diminish
the surplus for the moment; but in the case of a
prosperous company, the decrease is speedily more
than covered by accessions of profit from various
sources. It is clear, however, that the more
liberal the periodical distributions of profits, the
more gradual will be the growth of the surplus.
Conversely, if a life insurance company withho ds
from its policy-holders the full benefit of the pro-
portion of profits immediately available, and
prefers to accumulate in the interest of future
participants, it follows that the surplus will in-
crease more rapidly in proportion. Of course it
is easy to keep in hand more than the future will
require, under any possible circumstances; and,
when that course is followed, injustice to present
participants is inevitable.
Now, The Mutual Life of New Yofikj while
careful to make abundant reserves for future
bonuses, lias always been equally careful to dis-
tribute to its policy-holders the full immediate
benefits w'hich they are entitled to claim. The
Company has never sacrificed the interests of
policy-holders entitled to immediate participation,
to the formation of an imposing but empirical
surplus, never likely to be required even in the
remotest future. The surplus shown by The
Mutual Life at the end of 1896 was =£6,105,444.
It is a steadily increasing surplus, which, need-
less to say, is more than ample for all the
demands for which it has been created.
But, supposing the Company had, throughout
its history, acted on the principle which
has been adopted in, at least, one prominent
instance—of reserving a large proportion of the
surplus at every distribution, and, in addition,
reducing the surrender-values allowed for discon-
tinued policies, what does the reader suppose
would have been the amount of The Mutual’s
surplus in 1896 ? Not six millions, but upwards of
24 millions sterliny! This is not guesswork. The
figures are based upon the official report issued by
the Insurance Department of the State of New
York, which gives annually the exact record of
every company doing business in that State.
Since itsorganisatiori, Tiie Mutual Life has paid
in bonuses and surrender values to its policy-holders
.£44,445,244, which is more than twice the amount
paid for similar items by the next largest company.
Observe, then, what a magnificent surplus The
Mutual could have exhibited to-day, had an
illiberal policy been pursued in relation to the
assured —a surplus exceeding that of any other
office by more than 150 per cent. But, fortunately,
the Company preferred to sacrifice a mere useless
and vainglorious display to the solid interests of
the policy-holders. Who shall say that, in taking
thiscourse, the Mutual Life of New York has
not chosen the better part? and that, in so doing,
it has not well earned the high reputation which
it has attained in every part of the world as “ the
Policy-holders’ C 0.,” “ the Co. which does the most
good ? ” The intelligent reader will not allow him-
self to be misled by the parading of sums of no
use to the present generation, and in excess of
any possible needs of the generations to come,*


WOMEN IN COURT.
During the present sittings of the Central Criminal Court, his
Honor was obliged to ask one of the witnesses, an elderly woman, a certain
question, and he remarked that he experienced some delicacy in doing so in
the presence of so many women, old and young. He added that he could
not understand respectable women sitting and listening to evidence of the
kind.
Elderly Witness (hearing rather imperfectly) : “ Ah ! my son, you’ll have to
ask someone older than me ! ”

Some of the bundles of clothes sent
by charitable people in the city to the
distressed districts in Gippsland after the
bush fires were not -acceptable (says.
Melbourne Argus). Theyvwere sadly wanting in several essen-.

place, th.ev were of a character unknown in the bush. " ' "
At Thorpdale a, bundle of left-foot boots, mostly women’s,

Several persons who follow the occupation of rail-splitting have sud-
denly come forth in all the glory of frock-coats and bell-toppers, and
one or two have made an appearance in uniforms formerly worn
either by the Salvation Army or by letter-carriers. In another dis-
trict a person answering to the sobriquet “ Tiger Ned ” may be seen
abroad in the garb of the church ;• but an Irishman who has been
driven to wear a kilt sent up by some benevolent Highlander may
be recorded as an object of pity.

29th November, 1883.
Mrs. KENION has much pleasure in saying that she
and those who have used the HAPSBURG PIANO at the
Court have been much pleased by the quality and sweet-
ness of the Instrument.
Mrs. KENION will have much pleasure in recommend-
ing the HAPSBURG PIANOS.
Theatre Royal, 28th July, 1883.
I congratulate you on your successful introduction of
the HAPSBURG iron-framed Pianofortes. I have used
several of them in different towns, and have invariably
found them all that could be desired in a first-class Piano-
forte. Being extremely powerful, sweet, and clear in
tone, the touch is elastic and sympalhetic ; and, although
tuned above concert-pitch (a test which few Pianos will
stand), I can always depend upon the HAPSBURG
PIANOS remaining well in tune. I can strongly recom-
mend the HAPSBURG Pianos to anyone desiring a first-
class instrument at a very reasonable price.—l remain,
gentlemen, yours, etc.,
J. A. DELANEY, Conductor Montagu-Turner
Opera Company.
Sir WILLIAM C. ROBINSON, Governor of South Aus-
tralia, has given his unqualified approval of the HAPS-
BURG PIANOS, after careful examination. This being
duly reported in the two Adelaide papers, a storm of cor-
respondence ensued from jealous competitors. The good
opinion of the talented composer of “Unfurl the Flag”
may well be highly esteemed.
Sir ARTHUR PALMER, Acting-Governor of Queens-
land, expressed his satisfaction, and purchased a HAPS-
BURG for his own use on account of its special sweetness.
From M. HENRY KOWALSKI, the talented composer
of the well-known “ Marche Hongroise ” and others, a
member of the Jury of Class 13 (musical instruments),
Centennial Exhibition, Melbourne
Sydney, 18th May, 1890.
In answer to your inquiry concerning the qualities of
the HAPSBURG PIANOS, I will say that they possess a
good inusical tone, easy touch, and can occupy a superior
stand amongst the great number of instruments imported
into Australia. I consider that they are durable, their
mechanism showing every element which constitutes a
careful work and conscientious making.
I remain, Sir, yours truly,
HENRI KOWALSKI.

and composer, conductor of the Philharmonic Society,
formerly conductor of Orchestra in Teatro Della Scala,
Milan, leading theatre of Italy, and largest in Europe
Sydney, Bth August, 1889.
Having had experience of the HAPSBURG PIANOS in
many places, I preferred to purchase one here for my own
house. I have much pleasure to say that it is in all re-
spects a very perfect instrument. The construction and
mechanique aie suited to this climate. I commend them
for the splendid finish and faithful workmanship. The
tone and power cannot be excelled.
R. HAZON,
From the Royal Conservatoire of Milan, Italy.
.Rev. W. G. LAWES, New Guinea, writes :—Port Mores-
by, February 19th, 1880.—The PIANO purchased from
you four years ago has stood this trying climate remark-
ably well.
Rev. J. LEVY, 137 Phillip-st., Sydneyl beg to inform
vou that the HAPSBURG PIANO I purchased from you
is highly toned, and is to my entire satisfaction, and I can
confidently recommend them to the public.
Rev. HENRY JOBSON, St. John’s Vicarage, Cowra, 12th
August, 1889.
The PIANO mentioned was purchased by me for one of
my parishioners, Mr. Robert Brien, Back Creek, Cowra.
It' gives every satisfaction, and they seem very pleased
with it.
Very Rev. J. T. MARRIOTT, D.D., Dean of Bathurst,
N.S.W., 13th August, 1889.
The HAPSBURG PIANO supplied to me three years
ago by you has given satisfaction. Its tone has been
much admired, and it stood the test of the last extremely
dry season wdthout the slightest injury.
Rev. J. HORNSBY-SPEAR, St. Peter’s Parsonage, Mount
Victoria, N.S.W., 2nd April, 1890.
I purchased a HAPSBURG PIANO from you eight years
ago, and although it has been constantly in use, and has
borne the brunt of at least six journeys (some of them
very long ones), yet it appears to me to be in as perfeot
order, condition, and tone as when it first left your ware-
house. (This gentleman also mentioned that the piano
had only.required tuning once during the eight years.)
Rev. R. THOMSON, The Manse, Tenterfield.
The HAPSBURG PIANO which I obtained from you
has given us every satisfaction. It seems to be excep-
tionally economical in the matter of tuning.
Rev. JAS. S. SCOTT, The Manse, Woodburn, R.R.
I cannot speak too highly of your HAPSBURG PIANOS.
Abetter-toned instrument I have never heard than the
one you supplied to me. Since I got it the Hcod-waters
have been twice in the house, the piano being simply
removed above water-mark, and yet it retains the same
surpassing brilliancy of tone and high exterior polish.
Rev. CIIAS. H. GIBSON, M. A.
Macdonaldtovvn, March 11, 1890.
I have much pleasure in informing you that the
HAPSBURG PIANO .you sent me five years ago has
given entire satisfaction. It is a very fine instrument
sweet tone, and easily kept in tune.
Rev. JAMES MOSS, Ladies’ College,
Waverley, 28th July, 189 i..
We have had one of Beale and Co.’s HAPSBURG
PIANOS in constant use in our school during the last six
years, and have thus proved that the instrument is good
in tone and durable in quality.
Rev. MATTHEW MADDERN,
Orange, July 31st, 1890.
I have much pleasure in certifying that the HAPS-
BURG PIANO which I purchased from you seven years
ago is a capital instrument, and seems to improve in
sweetness and mellowness of tone with age. It is a
charming piano, and though I have moved it about in
my itinerating life to all points of the compass, and it
has been in all varieties of climate, nothing seems to
knock it out of tune or repair.
Rev. JAS. MATHESON, Archdeacon,
The Rectory, Warwick (Q.).
I desire to convey to you the hearty thanks of myself
and the other members of my committee for your kind-
ness in lending us, on the occasion of both concerts,
and also during the several days on which the bazaar
was held, one of your famed HAPSBURG PIANOS. The
music rendered on such an instrument was a real treat,
and considerably enhanced the success of the several
benefits, w'hich, you will be glad to hear, have resulted
in furnishing sufficient money for the object required,
Rev. J. 0. WARNER, Parsonage,
Warwick, Q.
I may say that we are very much pleased with our
HAPSBURG. It keeps its tone well, and is as sweet to-
day as when it was first received. We can speak very
highly of it now, and we trust and expect that we will
always be able to do so.
Rev. HENRY PLUME, M.A.,
Yicar of St. James’s, Townsville, Q.
I have great pleasure in testifying to the superior
quality and tone of the HAPSBURG PIANO forwarded
to me by your firm in Townsville. It has been in my
drawing-room through two dry and wet seasons, and yet
has not only preserved, but improved, its original quality
and tone. I do not know of any other piano so well cal-
culated to stand the trying seasons of the tropics as the
Hapsburg.
St. Joseph’s Convent, West Kempsey,
February 16, 1897.
The Rev. Mother of St. Joseph's Convent, West Kemp-
sey, got a HAPSBURG PIANO from Messrs. Beale and
Co. in July, 1896. She has much pleasure in saying it
has given her great satisfaction, as indeed any instrument
bv them always has.
Sister M. STANISLAUS D'ARCY.

Nazarette Convent, Bega, - :
6th August, 1896.
The PIANO is all you recommend it to be. Thanking
you for the pains you have taken to give us such satis-
faction with the beautiful instrument,
Sister M. EMILIAN O'CONNOR.
(These ladies have three of our pianos.)
St. Mary’s Convent, Wollongong, ,
February‘l2th, 1897.
The Sisters of the Good Samaritan have much pleasure
in recommending the HAPSBURG PIANO, purchased by
them from Messrs. Beale and Co. spme time ago, for its
durability and usefulness in their schools. -e

satisfaction, and we find them to withstand admirably
the tropical climate of Northern Queensland.

The PRESENTATION SISTERS, Hay, have much
pleasure in certifying that their 70-guinea HAPSBURG
PIANO has given them unbounded satisfaction, not-
withstanding its being in constant use for the past seven
years.

I have much pleasure in recommending Messrs. Beale
and Company’s HAPSBURG PIANOS. I consider them
particularly suited to Boarding Schools, as they are very
durable.

Dear B.—Hearing that Sydney T. and 0.
Journal, of 26th Feb., had got a spirited illustra-
tion of the boats leaving the foundering Atacama,
I was tickled to find that what the block really
represents is a German ship, in good order and
condition, hove-to, and sending a boat to rescue
castaways from (apparently) Spanish vessel, El
Paso, of Corunna. The fakeinan forgot to take
the lettering off the boat’s stern. Thus does
“ great” journalism rise to the occasion.— Alex.
M.
On a nearly-played-out subject :
Editor Bulletin, — Your correspondent “ Maori ” adds
his little perjury to the old gag about the discovery of a
decayed corpse in the bath of a London hotel. He fears
that the “untravelled Australian” may “miss the
point ” of that ancient chestnut, so he wades in to make
it quite clear how all the screed you have lately published
about the personal uncleanliness of the hated Britisher is
mere spiteful tommy-rot, and no one knows it better than
the travelled Bulletin, but part of the mission of the
'* Bushman’s Bible”is to further swell the noddle of the
“ native ”by leading him to believe he is civilised. Evi-
dently “ Maori ” was not a social success in London, and
so when he reads the legend of the corpse in the London
bath (it used to be a French bath) he uses it as a peg on
which to hang his grudge against the Britisher at his
hotel w'ho glared at him stolidly and said “ Haw 1”
just that and nothing more —when “ Maori ” had
chipped into the conversation with a friendly “By
cripes, any o’ yous coves goter match ? ” It’s a
way the Britisher has of snubbing outsiders, but
it doesn’t prove that he objects to wash himself.
As to the 4x2 dungeon bathroom “Maori” mentions.
What a “ri-a-rally” with the screw-jacks it must have
taken to get George Reid into his bath at the Hotel
Cecil 1 Perhaps “ Maori ” has got his “ princely caravan-
serai ” mixed up with his fourpenny cubicle at one of the
huge model lodging-houses. The mistake is excusable,
but if he wished_ to gratify his yearning for a matutinal
or any other “ dip ” he could have done so in any part of
London —not “ 2s. to 6s. a go,” but for the modest 2d.
that would have procured him use of a clean bathroom,
two clean towels, new cake of soap, brush and comb,
boot-jack, flesh-brush and mirror with hot or cold water
as desired ; or for the same money he could have had a
swim in a carefully-warmed swimming-bath in any parish
in London. Can you get that in any part of any city in
Australasia? In view of the extreme cleanliness of the
native is it not remarkable that so many Australian hash-
shops proudly include a bath in their trinity of luxuries —
“ bath, piano, and latch-key.” No need to advertise such
an item in London, as the blawsted Britisher takes it for
granted that the “tub” is included. Again, if the Lon-
doners, as your fatuous correspondent asserts, have such
a horror of water, how does he explain the fact that hun-
dreds of men and boys go in the early morning to bathe
at the Serpentine lake, the Highgate and Hampstead
ponds, &c., all through the winter when they have to
break the ice to get in ? The dirtiest dog will bathe out
here in the summer, not for cleanliness but for coolth.
You have given the native plenty of space on the subject;
don’t you think it’s time you gave the no-account
Britisher a show' ?—C.C.

Warner’s Safe Cure.
Mr. W. ,T. Kabi.k, of “Flashes’’ Office,
Brisbane, late of Lilyvale Station, 'barroom,
Nov. 25 1807, writes : —H. H. Warner and
Co., Ltd., Melbourne, (rentlemen.—Having
been a martyr to acute rheumatism for many
years; after having tried all the acknowledged
remedies without relief, T was persuaded by
one of rny employes to try Warner’s Safe
Cure. The second bottle added considerably
to my comfort and relief. Under such satis-
factory results I was induced to continue
using this miraculous mixture, and after using
the fourth bottle I felt a new mail ; and,
although this occurred several years ago, I
can conscientiously assert that, since using
Warner's Safe Cure, I have not felt the
sl ghtest twinge of that dreaded complaint,
and in fact, have never taken medicine of
any sort since, and have been in a perfect
state of health ever since. I have recom-
mended Warner’s Safe Cure to many sufferers
since my own marvellous cure for indigestion,
dyspepsia, and other internal complaints, and
in all cases I have been heartily thanked for
suggesting so simple, inexpensive, and effica-
cious a remedy. You are perfectly at liberty
to make what use you like of this. I send
it to you as a mark of gratitude.’ *

ot the Reid policy for the next couple of months
will be that concerned with the deportation of the
unemployed from the metropolis before the

N.S.W. Public Service Board has reduced
the cost of the Civil Service by <£301,890 a year.
Yet there is no corresponding reduction in the
total public expenditure; the finances aren’t
any better—there is only the blessed knowledge
that they might have been a lot worse.
N.S.W. official Freetraders insidiously
circulate that if the Parliamentary Labor party
wanes m allegiance to the Government, the latter
will support the Conservatives of the Protectionist
party in wiping out wholly or reducing by one-half
the present rate of payment of members.

kill Federation since its own defeat at the delegate-
enaction. °
Hirossell, TV.A. Lands Minister, roars to
the effect that Federation will wreck all land settle-
ment in W. A. Throssell probably thinks that people
go to \V estralia to enjoy the pure blessingof Forrest
government as it bubbles up from tlie red soil of
old bandgroper-land, and if a loathsome Federal
Legislature starts to dilute that blessing they will
depart at once.
Westralian Premier Forrest said in Con-
vention that unless snob posts as State-Governor-
ships were open to Australians t is wretched con-
tinent would “never cultivate a leisured class ”
It never will, in any case—unless the hands of
I line turn backwards. There is no room in Aus-
tralia for a leisured class. There will one of these
years be no room for it anywhere on the earth.

wanted it, because, though the latest-ereated'port-

formed in June, ’93, and
there is every prospect of
his occupying the same
position in June, ’9B,

years. Kingston who
has been Premier for five
years without having to

One of the speechless men of the Conven-

his feet over the question of consolidating the
public-debts, and did a speak. Nobody ever knew
Venn to speak before. He has brought tons of
books and papers with him, and has filled him-
self up with facts, and has repeatedly got half off
ins seat and got his mouth partly open. But
until this famous occasion, Venn never really
spoke. the crushed nine from VV.A. are a very
silent lot, and even Forrest, the loquacious crusher
of the U.A. delegation, would be reckoned silent

The Convention’s latest compromise on
the railway question is a painful case of trying to
wobble in two places at once. It boils down to
these six propositions :
(1) Each State may make any railway-rates it likes;
(2) at the same time, the Federal Parliament may make
laws to prevent any State charging rates which are
injurious to the trade of another State ; (3) all the same,

THAT TYRED FEELING .
FIRST RACING CTCLIST : “ What tyres were you riding when you won
the Gatemoney Handicap? ”
SKCOND DITTO : “ Dunne; haven't leen paid yet! ”
The Federal delegates, last week, solemnly
msnlved to “recognise the Supreme Being in the
Constitution.” Which was, doubtless, very kind
of them. At the same time, if the pious person
really understood the immense gulf between the
Omnipotent and a transient delegate named
Henry Briggs, he would leave the matter alone.
1 lie idea of a Deity being recognised by Henry
Biggs has some elements of the grotesque.
NO ADMISSION.
St. Peter heard that here below
We had admitted God. “Ahem!”
Says he. “ Some pleasant day, I know,
I will refuse that boon to them. ’
Q.. Labor press is not exactly a happy
family Brisbane Work eh slangs Hoolan per-
sistently, and Dawson and Dunsford intermit-
tently. Dawson and Dunsford’s paper, Charters
lowers Bagi.E, slangwhangs Hoolan, Sim, and
Jackson for their votes in favor of the Maruba-
Chillagoe railway syndicate. Hoolan’s Mundic
Miner gives the Worker “rats,” repudiates its
connection with the Labor-party, and savs that it
is aH Higgs-'* Woolly Willie, of Woollooinooloo.”
All the same, Higgs’s articles on the Q.N Bank
corruption were the ablest published in Kanaka-
Jand ; and Hoolan was found astride the fence
taking fees from the Nelson gang.
If N.S.W. Linds Department's recently
ae vised regulation, denying the press the right to
inspect the registers of Land Board decisions,
be defensible on public grounds, then a similar
regulation of the Justice Department deny-
v mg the press access to the records of de-
cisions in tiie lower and superior courts
will also be defensible.
Premier Kingston has completely
changed the political temper of his col-
leagues. Witness Cockburn, who is
even a silent member of the Conven-
tion. At one time Cockburn was
one of the most gitrrulous of S.A.
politicians, the leader of the pro-
gressive land-tax movement, a bril-
liant lecturer, and almost a states-
man. But now lie is morose, silent,
overshadowed, and anxious to forsake
politics for the Agent-General-
ship and oblivion.
t Under whatever injustice
NQ. may groan, it certainly
doesn’t suffer when portfolios are allotted.
Three Ministers (Philp, Chataway, and
Dalryiriple) now hail from north of Capri-
corn. Poor little Mackay—a third-rate town
even in Queensland—sends down two Ministers
of the Crown, while Brisbane city, Maryborough,
Kockhampton, Toowoomba, and Charters Towers
can't muster one among them. Potent factors in
Q. polities are sheep, sugar, and rum !
Brisbane (Q.) Courier attacking the
Labor party:
Is it desirable for a party who take the class position
avowedly, who have been elected on the strength of it
and have continuously thrust it to the front "to be ac-
cepted as the Government of the country.
No !It can only be accepted as the Misgovern-
nient of the country. And, therefore, the Nelson
class ‘ push” must Got
Cardinal Moran, who votes in King Divi-
sion and made no secret on the three last occasions
of voting- for G. H. Reid—“ in fact, I always vote
for Mr. Reid,’ he told a questioner—has now to
face the question of Reid or Slattery, which ?
One subtle casuist lias recommended bis Emi-
nence to change his elector's right from the
Presbytery in King Division to the palace at Manly
and so euchre both Scylla Tommy and Charybdis
George.
The N.S.W. Law Dept, having decided to
proceed no further with the Carruthers-Norton
libel-suit, the report that Minister Carruthers will
resign is again in the air. If Carruthers had let
things alone, on the ground that his opponent was
too small an insect for notice, all might have been
well. But he asked a jury to give him a clear
certificate of character and didn’t get it, and now
the abandonment of the case may be taken to
imply that there is no visible chance of getting it.
Believed that Arthur Palmer, till the Q.
N. Bank cloud lifts, will retire from Presidency of
Q. Leg. Council. The salary is A'IOOO, and the
ex-builock-dri ver wants the money, but a question
°f political ctaueney ” has been mooted to him,
and a temporary surrender is expected. If, as is
probable, he also drops the acting-Governorship,
Lritiith, C.J., will have the opening for which,
years ago he schemed. Griffith is the only Aus-
trail an C. J. denied succession as acting-Governor.
. Convention Chairman Chaffey Baker aston-
ished G. H. Reid, the other evenimr. Reid in
order to escape a vote on a Federal capital amend-
ment, went out into the seats reserved for on-
looking M’s.P., and from that point he interjected.
Whereupon Baker: “If any individual outside
the House dares to interfere I shall order the
galleries to be cleared.” The Age daily glorifies
Reid by insisting that he is robbing Victoria of
everything, and, under this stimulus, the little
great man is swelling visibly.
The sending by the Australian Premiers
of that direct message of sympathy over the
Maine disaster has been a shock to the right-
thinking persons who shrink in such a superiah
mannah from direct cable communication with
America which they fear might contaminate
Australia, but which Australia is bound to have
ere long. These are the people who affect to be
only officially aware of the Great Republic’s exist-
ence, and object to turn a large dull eye upon any
American intelligence that hasn’t first been Bull-
dozed.
Newcastle (N.S.W.) Chamber of Com-
merce has resolved (and informs the Federal Con-
vention of the fact) that it would be detrimental
to the interests of the Commonwealth if the
appeal to the English Privy Council were
abolished, and litigants could get a final decision
m Australia instead of having to stagger after it
to the far end of the globe. The Bulletin hears
that there were six people present at the meeting
and they were equally divided on tin- subject, the
noble sentiment about the best interests of our
country being carried only by the casting-vote of
the cnau man.
At a recent “ purification of the rolls ” in
Melbourne, the usual police-official solemnly at-
tested that certain electors had left. “ I didn’t
visit Catherwood’s house myself,” he admitted ;
“ I got a man to go round for me.” Man found
and questioned. “ No, I didn’t call at Cather-
wood’s house myself,” he also admitted ; “ I asked
a man if Catherwood had left, and he said ‘Yes.’
I don’t know the name of the man.” So the Vic.
elector is deprived of his vote now because an
alleged man, name unknown, is said to have told
another man that he has quitted the district, and
the other man related the tale to a policeman.■
Eight years ago the Australian Natives’
Association held in Melb. a deadly-dull inter-
provincial convention ”to promote Federation ;
and a pretty bad kind of curse seems to have
alighted upon it. The then newly-knighted Bray
was president ; his brain weakened, and he died.
Cither S. A. delegates were the unfortunate Paris
Nesbit; J. C. I. Johnson, who has disappeared
from politics ; Barrett, about whom the less said
the better ; and Tucker, who has gone into the
Adelaide Hospital chairmanship, which is worse
than gaol Of N.S.W. men were the lately-
deceased Ninian Melville and B. 15. Nichol and
M. S. Dowel; all three have lost their seats in
Parliament. Two others ha ve failed to get seats.
Of the Victorians, though most of the delegates
were in Parliament or were political aspirants, the
only one now in the House is Peacock.
“ A word for Australia.” In one of the
angry, wordy provincial battles which were of
such frequent oecnrr. nee between the big guns of
N. and Victoria in the Convention struggle
re warring rail way-rates, it was only the presence
of the amused and sometimes piously-pained non-
combatants from the land of S!eep-a-Lot and S. A.
that prevented Reid, Turner and 00. from getting
down to the first principles erstwhile acted on by
Crick, Samson Haynes and Ginger Clarke in the
homely N.S.W. Assembly. After the row had
cooled off the wily fat men of the parties jumped
in to take back a lot they had said. “I know,”
drawled Surplus Reid. “ that the hon. Vic. dele-
gates, in their determined measures and vigorous
antagonism to my learned friend’s amendment,
were actuated, and I don’t hesitate to say it, by
what they believe to be and what probably are
absolutely the best interests of their own pro-
vince.’ And so far have the Vic. tpn removed
themselves from the arena of true Federal ambi-
tion that there was not one man amongst them to
throw the compliment back at Reid’s head, and
reply that it was the best interests of Australia
they were considering.

The horse-flies of politics get on best by
continuing to blister their prey. Look at Q.
Home -Secretary -cum- Railways Dickson. He
went into Pari t. as an “ Independent ” (having
downed the Ministerial candidate for Bulimba),
sat on the cross - benches, and mosquitoed the
Ministry with dreary, woe-begone, polysyllabic
speeches, sermons cautions, and denunciations.
Dickson’s strong point in oratory is that he won’t
use one sufficient word when he can sausage-string
six unnecessary ones upon it, and that he will
never use a one-syllable word when he can think
of a two-er ; or a two-r-r, if he has got a three-er ;
and so on. After getting fly-bitten with Dickson,
Nelson offered him a portfolio, which D. grabbed
with both hands. And now he is Home-Secre-
tary, the most important Minister next to the
Premier himself !
The Deity has at last received local habita-
tion and home in the Australian Commonwealth
Bill. When Gov. Phillip founded the settlement
of Botany Bay, he rejected overtures made by the
Fleet parson to have the name of God associated
with the establishment of the province. The chap-
lain of the day, writing about it, complains that
he was officially ignored. The soldiers were
drawn out, the flags run up, the proclamation
read, and cheers and volleys of musketry followed,
“ but all the time,” wrote the parson to the Secre-
tary of State, “I was left to stand under the shade
of a tree, and was made to feel that neither God
nor I was wanted at the foundation of the new
nation.” One hundred and ten years later the
parson, it seems, has been invited to come from
under that tree.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Five days before the last test-match ended,
Stoddart expressed his determination to speak his mind
about the Australian barracker. And when the last test-
match ended, and England came out of it severely
whipped, Stoddart raised a Ions? and piteous howl about
the beastly barracker. Cricketers, as Tub Bulletin has
often remarked, are mere overgrown schoolboys. “To be
a cricketer” (says Phil Sheridan, and he ought to know),
“ one requires very little brains, and that little must be
entirely devoted to cricket.” Hence cricketers, when
beaten by the other side, and, in addition, barracked and
laughed at by the crowd, are inclined to become demon-
strative. No schoolboy can stand being “ barracked ” or
" laughed at.’ There is always a “ nasty ” section in every
crowd, and Stoddart, like Ranji and the rest, was too great
a schoolboy to be able to treat the “ nasty section ” with
the contempt it deserves. Mr. Stoddart 'must really not
get angry because, when he misses a catch, the crowd
laughs at him. And Ranji, who is the “flashest”
cricketer this paperever saw, must not take on so theatri-
cally because the crowd laughs and chuckles when he
misses a catch and says such words as “butter-fingers”
and “gum.” As for the Tom-Garrett-agony side of the
question, that ancient, plucky war-horse should have
been “chivvied” out of cricket long ago. Cricket is a
game for boys ; not for elderly civil-servants in receipt of
large salaries.
Onesuperstition
received severe punish-
ment in the closing test-
match is the idea that the
Britisher dies hard. Noth-
ing could have been much
softer than the English
acceptance of approaching
defeat. Bad temper, bad
discipline, and hail mo-ale
were all conspicuous.
During the last 20min.
they pulled, up a littie,
anil went to a certain
death with something like
decency, hut up to that
point, their fielding was
in wretched contrast to
their own former efforts.
The failure was ventral
and comprehensive. M‘-
Laren and Briggs «ere
bowled for ducks. Ranji
failed each time. Hearne
kept a very poor length,
for him, and only got two
wickets. Richardson lost
his length, his temper,
and his head. Druce and
the two Yorkshiremen
collapsed in the s>cond
innings, Mason in botii.
Catches were missel ail
round, even by Briggsaml
Ranji. Hayward and
Storer alone played up
gamely, stopping the rot
in each innings, and doing
fairly reliable work in the
field. They, too, each
missed critical chances
once, and they were the
best of a bad bunch.
The complacent N.S.W. theory about the re-
versal of form by the Englishmen is that it was “ the new
bowling” (/.e,, Noble and Howell) that paralysed them
in the later test-matches after their easy win in the first.
Facts don’t bear it out. In the Britishers’ initial effort
five men made nearly 500 of the total scored. Of the
twelve players who have taken part in the “tests” none
of the other seven have ever made a serious appearance,
save for the temporary emergence into efficiency of Druce
and Wainwright for one innings each in the last en-
counter. The five men who did score then have scored,
more or less freely, ever since off the “ new ” bowling as
readily as off the old. They have never happened to all
five come off together, and the remaining seven (who
failed when Noble and Howell were not howling) have
failed with sorrowful consistency ever since.
The real secret of the failure of the team is the
reduction in the number of its reliable bats, after the
style of Gideon's army, and the expectation of five men to
play an Australian eleven and win “on their own.” On
the one occasion on which they all five came off, they did
win. In every other match, two or three of them have
struck snags, and with them the team. In the last
match, the new bowlers didn't take an important wicket.
But three of the five men failed in the second innings,
and the rest was silence. Wanted, a travelling team of
(say) 16 players, from which eight or nine men in foun
can always be picked for test-matches.
In the test-match, just over, four “crack”
amateur bats made 138 runs in the first innings. The
four professional bats made 184. Seeing that all of the
latter have some additional recommendation besides
hatting (one keeps wicket and all howl), the comparison
in their favor is sufficiently striking to he discomforting
to “gentlemen” players. In the second innings, the
difference in performance was still more marked. The
amateurs made 41, the pros. 87. Hayward was top scorer,
Storer second, Briggs (another pro.) third. Apart from
M’Laren’s contributions, the professionals have all through
supplied what element of reliability there has been in
the team. Hayward has now, iu four successive innings,
had to check the panic which always seems to have set in
on M’Laren's downfall, and has done it to the tune of 50
and 60 eaoli time. Wainwright has proved a sudden suc-
cess as first man after a series of failures by an amateur.
Storer and Hirst are two of the three “ aggressive ” bats
of the combination. What price a team of all profes-
sionals next time? Or pros. “ assisted by Mr. M'Laren ” ?
Abel could replace Ranji, and Brown and Ward the two
young amateurs. With a specialist hat like Gunn in
place of “all-round ” Hirst or Wainwright (whose howling
is of no value in Australia), and a specialist bowler like
Meades or Mold in place of Briggs, it would be a far
harder crowd to beat than this one.
* * * *
The fifth test-match was “anybody’s game”
until one man—the only man of the whole crowd—began
to hit out vigorously. Then it was h.is game.
• * * *
It is as ridiculous for England’s harrackers to
deny the all-round superiority of Australian cricket in
the test-matches as for Australian harrackers to ussert
that the Englishmen batted (or bowled for that matter)
up to average All-England “form.” The daily press
hereabouts shows its bias by attributing all the failure of
the visitors’hatting to the excellence of the Australian
bowling and fielding, and all the success of the Australian
batting to the excellence of the men who made the
runs. There is not a more boyishly-biassed barracker
than Melb. Age, which fed the mob outside its
office, last week, with special announcements that
M’Laren and other Englishmen had been “missed”
in the field whilst making their little lot but did not
record the occasional “ let offs” of Darling and co. Next
year an Australian eleven will be going' to England, and
will, probably, get badly beaten from time to time.
The Age and other harrackers will refer to those defeats
as “ unaccountable.” Well, in the light of the last Aus-
tralian eleven performances at Lords’ and Kensington
Oval, the recent crushing defeats of Stoddart and co. are
likewise “ unaccountable.” After the first day’s play in
the final test, 15 English wickets fell for about 210 runs,
and only two of them made more than 30.
* * * *
Combo : In view of recent utterances of English
cricketers I suggest that the following new rules for the
conduct of the game of cricket be got ready in time for
next season :
1. The members of the public who are not English bar-
raekers must preserve the strictest silence during the
progress of the game.
2. Any person, not an English barracker, wishing to
speak must first obtain a written permit signed by all the
members of the English team.
3. The band will play “ God Save the Queen ” when-
ever (a) An Australian gets out ; (6) An Englishman
makes a run; (■•) An Englishman stops a fourer. The
public will thereupon rise and take off its hat, standing
reverently until the band stops. It can-then sit down.
4. At the conclusion of the day’s play, if it has been in
favor of the Englishmen, the public will take off its hat
and sing “ God Save the Queen ” and “ Rule Britannia.”
5. If it has not been in favor of the Englishmen the
band will play “The Dead March in Saul,” and the public
will proceed at slow march (and in silence) out of the
ground.
Special Notice.—No flies admitted : all flif.s found
on the ground will be shot, and their owners prose-
cuted.

One member of the English team, who made a
point of irritating the cio"" 1 °n old offender in
THE GOBBLER AND HIS LAST.
[?]-WEIGHT SPORTSMAN (to the in-
nocent Ranji) : “ I rode and won
on Rat-i-tat, and I’ve called,
yer Royal Highness, about the
five pound you promised the
jockey for winning.”—(Ranji
pays him without demur.)
“ Good evenin’, Ranji: I'm the boy
that rode Rat-i-tat, and I’ve
come for that there liver.”
—(Ranji is perfectly as-
tounded!)
that and other respects, and was once warned by the
Marylebone C.C. to “ be more careful in future.”
A few facts from the last test-match : The
Englishmen scored units in 10 out of 22 batting attempts,
whereas the Australians had only 4 units among 17 indi-
vidual scores. Fourof the visitors—Ranji, Mason, Hearne,
and Richardson - averaged 51 runs per head for 8 innings.
Hayward and Druce between them scored a third of Eng-
land’s grand total, but their joint contribution of 172 was
2 runs less than Darling gave to the Australian side. No
other batsman on either side averaged more than 45.
Three Austialians—Darling, Jones, and Trumble-won
the match, whilst R'chardson was the only brilliant per-
former on the other side. When Darling began to thrash
Richardson he was practically licking the English team.
S.A. cricketers are arranging a big testimonial
to Clem. Hill, the boy batting prodigy. It is to be pre-
sented to him on the first day of the match, S.A. v. Eng-
land, which happens, appropriately enough, to be his
21st birthday—March 18.
» * * *
The English team’s light went out with the old
year. Up to the end of December they had nine indivi-
dual scores of a “century” and upwards in first-class
matches, and since then they have made only two.
* * • *
S.M. Herald’s “ sequitur ” on the Stoddart
presentation : —“ Mr. Stoddart was relieved of his watch
and chain in Brisbane, during the tour of the team, so it
was decided to give him another in its place. . . . The
trustees had thought they could best mark their appre-
ciation of Mr. Stoddart’s service bv a useful present, which
would remind him of the many friends he had made in
Australia." No doubt every time “ Stod.” looks at that
watch he will be “ reminded.”
* * * •
The value of Sydney cricket-criticism. Simul-
taneous extracts from different dailies:—D.T. :“....
nearly all the runs coming off Richardson, who is by no
means now the bowler that he once was. He has" lost
much of his pace, and he does not possess any consider-
able control over his length, and, in a word, he cannot be
classed even in the same rank with Jones.” 5.M.11. :
“ . . . Richardson's performance of eight wickets for 94
on a perfect wicket in so great a match is an extraordinary
one, and will stand for many years as one of the pheno-
menal feats of cricket.”
* • * *
Centuries galore in Sydney electorate cricket on
Saturday. Alee. Mackenzie ran up 137 ; young Trumper,
191, not out; Conningham, 151; Youll, 102, not out; and
Noonan, 126.
* * * •
A man who has seen all the big matches of the
Stoddart tour puts Briggs and Richardson first in point
of uniform popularity with the crowds-anyhow, with
the crowd that barracks—with Druce and Storer at the
other end. The last is natural enough, no doubt, because,
as wicketkeepers, their duty has been to appeal oftenest
against the Australians.
• ♦ * *
Ayrshire’s preparation for Australian Cup was
decidedly unorthodox, the horse never having been sent
for any gallop beyond a mile. His success, however, will
not stop future Cup candidates being galloped to death
against the watch.
• * • *
Aurum did very well in running third for the
Australian Cup under the record weight of 9st. 31b. for a
three-year-old, but the performance was not as brilliant
as some people made it out to be. Old Battalion gave the
colt (ill)., and a beating equal to at least another 61b., on
weight calculations ; nor would Aurum have got a place
if Wait-a-Bit hadn’t shut up when pinched. One thing
seems certain. The St. Albans’ crack has not gone on
improving since the Spring.
* » * *
Aleck Taylor’s followers must have had about
enough of the handsome deceiver, Wait-a-Bit.
• * • *
Resolute’s easy capture of the Bourke Handicap
(7 furlongs) was gall and wormwood for any punters who
had backed him this time. At the finish of the more
important flutter, Resolute was in great trouble, whilst
Amiable was winning comfortably, and appearances cer-
tainly didn’t suggest that W. R. Wilson’s horse could
have overtaken the leaders if the course had been a
furlong longer. But when Amiable, Resolute, Reaper,
and Sailor Boy came to meet again in the Bourke Handi-
cap, it was Resolute’s turn to run away from the three
beaten sprinters who had previously seemed too fast for
him. The glorious uncertainty of the Turf gets very
monotonous.
* * * »
Fielder was serenely confident as to Amiable’s
ability to win the Newmarket. Just before the harrier
rose he said: “She’ll be in front from the jump, and
they’ll never sight her afterwards.” Amiable should do
well in England—a splendid mare, and one of the easy-
going sort. Very little femininity about her. As she
walked down the straight she looked like a stallion—in
fact, she’s the equine equivalent of the New Woman.
* * * *
Amiable seems to be the exception to the rule
that a horse—a mare, in this case—capable of staying six
furlongs down Flemington straight, at Newmarket
Handicap pace, may always he hacked to go a quarter of
a mile further. Judging from her performances m the
Bourke Handicap (7 furlongs) and again in the mile All-
Aged Stakes, the Sydney mare is a sprinter, pure and
simple.

Whernside’s performance in the Steeplechase last
Saturday was a double record for the race, which dates
back to ’7O. Mr. Sep Miller’s big ’un carried 91b. heavier
weight than any previous winner, and cut out the three-
miles in nearly. 9seos. faster time, ah hough he had 30
lengths to spare at the finish.

J. J. Miller’s Australian Racing Chronicle,
from Aug., 97, to Jan. 31, ’9B, was issued last week, in
time for “students of form” to take the hand}’ volume
to Flemington. Miller’s Chronicle is beginning to get
the patronage it deserves, and, with increased fervor,
The Bulletin herewith bestows another half-yearly
blessing on the publication.

“Ranji” Barden went back to England per
Cuzco. British Barden was about the most extensively-
advertised and worst “ big” cyclist who ever struck Aus-
tralia. Here Barden has distinguished himself for nothing
but his copious talk, and, from the man’s style of riding,
it seems impossible to believe that he was’, only a few
months back, the best man in Europe. The only explana-
tion possible is that Barden talked at the other men all
the while he was riding, and made them feel as tired as
Australia did, and his method of plugging along with an
open mouth would appear to support this theory.

The trot at Brighton (Sydney) on Monday last
was a terrible show. Lord Beldon trotted well for a
mile, and then came down to a gait about as fast as you
could kick your hat along. Silver Cloud, who was trot-
ting in good form, passed him and then broke in a most
unaccountable style ; Beldon again taking the lead. All
this time Viking Junior was galloping “on his own,”and,
turning into the straight the last time, the three were
all galloping and together. Silver Cloud passed the post
in front of Lord Beldon, but a protest was entered and
upheld, and the race awarded to Lord Beldon. Trotting
men seem to forget that Brighton is giving them the only
chance they are likely to get about Sydney for some time
to come.

I he 22-footer Effie scored another win, on Satur-
day, from scratch, and it looks as if Joe Donnelly has set
himself a big task in undertaking to build one to heat
her. Even Mr. Sam Hordern’s money may not he able to
bring forth anything better, at home or abroad, hut,
champion or otherwise, it is to be hoped Mr. H. will be
able to show sufficient originality to drop across another
name than Bronzewing.

Whernside’s victories are always popular. The
giant takes his weight, whatever it may he, to the
front as soon as possible, and gives his backers the sooth-
ing sensation of seeing him win all the way. The Miller
stable, by the bye, is said to have an even bigger rod than
Whernside in pickle.

Old Dondi last week joined the illustrious com-
pany of broken-necked hurdlers and steeplechasers. In his
best days, Dondi had a habit of jumping “on the bias,”
and was a tempestuous beast, hut he matured into a
fairly straight and steady goer. Lately, after three years
of failures, he made such a miraculous recovery of lost
speed that he went to his doom top-weighted.

“ The weights for the principal spring handi-
caps,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
“ show considerable respect for Nevvhaven 11. and Mer-
man, small regard for Daimio, and an utter disbelief that
Norton can jump four miles and a-half in the Grand
National. For the Lincolnshire straight mile Merman has
8.11; 41b. less for the extra quarter in the City and Sub-
urban, in which Newhaven 11. gives him a lb., and the
6-year-old Form ha- 6st. 121 b. In Chester Cup, 2) miles,
Newhaven 11. has 51b. below the top weight, Count
Schomberg, 9st. 51b. This is 101 b. more than Merman,
who is alone in the Jubilee, £3OOO, with Bst. 71b., and
should win it. If Daimio cannot come to the front with
lost. 101 b. in the £2500 steeple, he may be considered as
a fonr-stone worse horse than he was in Australia at his
best—though the English handicapper thinks him 101 h.
better than Norton. Whatever chance the antipodean
cracks have of scooping the prize pools of the Hats and
fences will, anyhow, be fairly seen in the season now
about to open.”

Arthur Cavill beat anything in Adelaide over
100yds. (fresh water) with his double overarm stroke, blit
in 500 and 1000yds., where d.o.s. would be too tiring, and
he had to drop down to the single overarm, he couldn’t
live with the Wares (Vic.), or even with some of the locals.
The Wares are wood-eutters, powerfully-built, but not
above medium height. The S.A. champion, M'Millan, is
unluckily out of swimming for a year with lung in-
flammation. He cut out lOOO.vds., in ’97, in 15.55, same
time as G. VVare won with this year. The Adclaideans
are disappointed with Cavill who, when he gave up half-
way in the 1000yds., was vigorously hooted.
At recent S. A. swimming-races a one-legged
man won a race with double-over-arm stroke, and aone-
armed man swam well also, but unplaced. The one-levger
is named Woodman ; only shrivelled stump of right thigh
remains to him, but he gels through the water at a great
pace. The one-armed youth, who looks like a West Indian
half-negro, swims side-stroke, with armless side up. The
3-ineh stump of arm moves like a fish’s fin, and the man
swims as if born in the water.
* • * *
The “ladies’ swimming race ” at Adelaide
Carnival was greeted bv hoodlumd >in present with a roar
of delight. Four nice girls, set. about 18, clad in
close-fitting singlets and knickers, reluctantly peeled off
overcoats in front of the crowd, and then all landed most
awful “ wallops ’ on the surface. Glossy black hair
became uyiy rats tails; the maidens swam a flurried, short,
jerky breast-stroke, which made their heads hob lip and
down like bi“ sea we jdy corks, and the unjLrallant crowd
just chortled with happiness. The damp darling’s were
met at the other end by total strangers, who put willing
arms round their clinging forms to lift them out. Adelaide
isn’t having any more “ ladies’ races.”
* * * * ,
Women mustered strongly at the Adelaide
Swimming Carnival ladies’ night. Men-swimmers wore
the scantiest costume —a little less than even cyclists use
and the sex watched their every movement lovingly.
Graceful, fair-haired N.S.W. Cavill fluttered many a
heart. “You can admire a man so much better, you
know, when you see a lot of him ! ”

This year’s Champion Stakes race, with only
two starters, was a genuine sporting event. Aniberite
won by 20 lengths from Bundook in smin. 27Isec., which
was only 4sec. slower than record time. The Derby
winner’s gallop was evidently intended to suggest that
the scratching of Auruin had been a fortunate thing for
plunging punters.

An Auckland (M.L.) hunter, Laddie, frightened
by an approaching train, cleared a concrete wall, ditch
and railway-line-total width, 41ft. Tall, but authenti-
cated.
In the case of the man and woman Wil-
liams, convicted of larceny by Sydney S.M.
Addison on Feb. 26, The Bulletin learns with
satisfaction that the decision had more to justify
it than originally appeared. The police record
shows that the female accused bears no good
character, and three convictions for drunkenness
stand against her. This, in the dubious circum-
stances, might be held sufficient to turn the
scale. The peculiar distinction between the
sentences awarded Williams and his wife seems
still unexplained, however ; and it is curious why,
if the police testimony to character was given in
open court, the Sydney Evening News reporter
did not note it.
The 1898 volume of the Year Book of
Australia is a trifle bigger than its predecessor,
and the stock of valuable information contained
between its two boards keeps growing larger. The
only thing Australian which the Year Book
doesn’t throw light upon, so far as the writer can
discover, is the question whether the laughing-
jackass eats snakes. Every other subject inside
this continent seems to be gathered into the com-
prehensive tome, which is a source of full, accu-
rate, and painstaking information on politics,
public and private finance, commerce, manufac-
tures, agriculture, building societies, banks, cricket,
football, horse and other varieties of sport, art,
science, geography, tariffs, and everything else.
And if the editor could see his way to state de-
finitely whether the laughing-jackass snakes
or not it would be complete.
Like a bombshell into many N.S.W.
homes will fall Judge (I. B. Simpson’s expressed
judicial uncertainty as to whether, when a clergy-
man is obtainable, marriage by a registrar is valid
unless the intending spouses sign a declaration
that they conscientiously object to be married by
a minister of religion. The prevailing notion has
been that the State, since it couldn’t undertake to
say which is the true faith, had provided a means
of civil contract which should be independent of
conflicting creeds. It is also commonly understood
that the Marriage Act provides that any marriage
shall be binding which both parties, at the time
of contraction, honestly believe to be valid. If
the law is as Judge Simpson asserts, how is it that
in so many cases the necessary declaration has not
been called for by the officiating registrar ?
Paris Ne.sbifc is not mad on law points.
His first act on reaching Adelaide Asylum for the
second time (whence he was transferred from gaol)
was to point out to medical-officer Cleland that, as
a certificate was not forwarded with him from the
gaol, his further detention was a common-law
offence under the Lunatics Act. “ Keep me here
another hour,” sidd Nesbit, “ and you are liabla
to two years’ gaol! ” Cleland’s hair commenced
to stand on end. “ I won’t prosecute you,” said
Nesbit; “in fact, I shall do no more than wish
you good evening,” and he walked out of the
building. The proceedings have been a farce
all through, and seem to again demonstrate
how Kingston’s colleagues can make asses
of themselves when the S.A. Premier is away.
Mr. Nesbit gave as his reason for his <£20,000
libel-action against S.A. Register, set down for
hearing early in March, that their par., headed
“Vagaries of a Q.C.,” spoilt his chance of the
Chief Justiceship. “For,” said he, “Way is
going to resign shortly ; neither Kingston nor Josh
Syinon will take the post, and who else is there
but myself? ” But the action will probably lapse.
Dr. Cleland certifies that Nesbit’s trouble mani-
fests itself in a tremendous excess of energy. Last
time he worked it off in the excitement of a
general election. But this time there’s no such
safety-valve, and apparently somebody has sug-
gested hard physical exercise, for Mr. Nesbit took
part the other day in a hunters’ competition, and
cleared his leaps gallantly—some of them with a
pipe in his mouth !
“SO LONG. RANJI!”
“Prince Ranjitsinhji, during his Australian visit, has
received some hundreds of admiring letters from impres-
sionable young ladies. A diamond pin fell out of one
recently received by him, which he bestowed upon the
waiter at his hotel.”
“ Prince Ranjit.sinhji’s early dismissal caused great dis-
appointment to t he large concourse whose interest seemed
to he principally centred upon the Prince making a large
score.”
“ Prince Ranjisinhji said that the team had been hooted
on every ground in Australia.”
Hoot! mon, ye ken the critic's howl
Is aye the lot of every hitter,
And why compare us to the owl,
Would not the cooing dove he fitter?
Ungrateful Prince ! and cold to boot,
Whose heart no billets doux have heated,
Let others tell the world we hoot—
You might more truly say we bleated !

dbufrialist, to The Bulletin :
, “Tommy” Wells, doyen of Melbourne’s active press-
men, dropped dead in harness on Saturday niirht week.
He was a tood-natured old fellow who, at 67, was as
gentle and fresh-minded as a child, and there is not a man
on the Melb. press who does not sincerely regret his
demise. Tommy was a Sheffield man, who reached Melb.
in the early fifties, todrift through mining and everything
else to journalism. For 27 years he had been law-reporter
on the Argus. He was my mentor, reportorially. He
told me he never read over his copy. I heard the sub.
rating him for leaving out bits of words. Says Tommy,
in reply : “What’s a sub-editor for?” Weils’s serious
advice to me was, “never look at your stuff in the paper.
You get worried, make complaints, and get a bad charac-
ter in the office, where they set you down for a nuisance.
Tommy hardly ever wrote a line of comment on anything
throughout his long career. Facts were his stock-in-
trade.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
ft. Newtnah, the well-khowfi jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to tneir advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems. *
The result of the Wolfe’s Schnapps £5O
test-match competition appears elsewhere in this
issue. The ingenuity of the people who gathered
many coupons together aud guessed “English, 1
wicket, 1 run,” “Australian, 1 wicket, 1 run,”
and so on seriatim, was duly rewarded; for in
course of coupons “Australians, 6 wickets, 2 runs ”
was reached, and that guess won. Unluckily,
there were several hundred ingenious or lucky
persons, who share the <£bo in terms of 2s. 9|d.
apiece or thereabouts. If the match had happened
to be won by an irregular number of runs, say 279,
probably nobody would have guessed right,*

Dear Bulletin, —Mr. E. R. Waite now
“ bosses ” the reptilian branch of the Australian
Museum, Sydney. Mr. Waite’s casts of Australian
snakes are marvellously life-like, and are emin-
ently creditable to him and his assistants. But
Mr. Waite will keep re-naming snakes for only
Joss knows what reason. Bor example, Krebt’s
common brown snake, (diemcnia supereiliosa )
becomes diemenia textilis. The tiger snake
{hoplocephalus curtus —Krefft) is Waitised into
notec,his scutatus ! Gould’s snake (hoplocephalus
(/ouldii-KreEt) is tortured into denisonia tjouldii.
The diamond snake (morelia spilotes —Krefft >
becomes python spilotes. And so on. What’s
the need or use or sense of it ?—H. J. M'Oooev.

USE ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT.’
It is Pleasant, Cooling, Soothing, Health-Giving, Refreshing and Invigorating.
YOU CANNOT OVERSTATE ITS CREAT VALUE IN KEEPINC THE BLOOD PURE AND FREE FROM DISEASE.
“AS an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO’S ‘FRUIT
SALT,’ I have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ henow ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it, about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.—I remain, yours faith-
fully, J. W. Neil.” —( From the late Rev. J. W. Neil, Holy Trinity Church , North Shields.)
HEADACHE and Disordered Stomach.—“ After suffering for nearly
* A two and a half years from SEVERE HEADACHE and DISORDERED
STOMACH, and after trying almost everything, and spending much money, with-
out finding any benefit, I was recommended by a friend to try ENO’S ‘ FRUIT
SALT ’ and, before I had finished one bottle I found it doing me a GREAT DEAL
of GOOD, and now I am RESTORED to MY USUAL HEALTH; and others I
know that have tried it have NOT ENJOYED such GOOD HEALTH for years.
Yours most truly, Robert Humphreys, Post Office, Barrasford.”
The effect of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ on any DISORDERED and FEVERISH
condition is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE’S OWN REMEDY
and an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTlON.— Examine each Bottle , and see CAPSULE is marked ENO'S ‘FRUIT SALT.'
Without it , you have been imposed on by a WOR THLESS imitation . Prepared only by

“ Hundreds of lives are ruined and many homes
are rendered desolate by continued and wilful
neglect of the ordinary precaution against ill-
health.
Many people have heavy doctors’ bills to meet;
and are never free from sickness, pain and worry,
when, by just taking,a commonsense view of the
matter, they will find that they will have a per-
manent and speedy cure almost at their doors,
which, while renewing the BLOOM OF HEALTH
AND VIGOR, improving the body and mind,
costs but a trifle.
How often we see strong
men in the prime of life
suddenly
Stagger in the Street,
and, on arriving at their
homes, find that they are
in for perhaps at least a
long and painful illness,
the cause, no doubt, of
neglected disorders, which
havg for sometime past
been devouring their mind
and reducing their
strength. Oases of this
kind occur daily, and an
INFALLIBLE CURE
is found in taking the

duties of a merchant, financier, departmental-
head, mine-manager, banker; expert, and politician,

ailment which has baffled the M EDICAL PRO-
FESSION. Too close attention to business,
being confined too much indoors, and the worry

everyone present, inasmuch as one of the players
Was known to suffer from a long-standing nervous
affection, so much so that he could scarcely hold
the cue iti his hand ; but notwithstanding this he
offered his opponent (who was a professional) 50

rPALES OE THE CONVICT SYSTEM, by
| ' Prick Wakung ; Is. 3d. posted.
An obviously verdant Sydney newspaper
correspondent asserts that the extent of Sydney
hotel Sunday-trading must be greatly exaggerated,
because when he wanted liquor on a Sunday for a
sick friend he couldn't strike it till the eighth try.
The Bulletin should smile ! Bung understands
well enough the man who wants to wet his own
ungodly whistle, but the “sick friend” racket—■
he’s been there before !
Mrs. Ayer, recently dead in Paris, liad
long been pestered by needy notabilities with
offers of marriage—of course for the sake of the
colossal pile which her husband made out of
sarsaparilla and Pot. iodide. The bottle of stuff
which cost him about a dime, he used to vend at a
dollar—whacking that amount with the news-
paper-man for advertising. As in the N.S.W.
tea-business, that’s where the newspaper-man
comes in.

A Logan (South Q.) journal has struck a
patch of limitless possibilities. Inasmuch as
some of the gentlemen present at a local hop
complained that their names were not mentioned
in the local paper, the editor on the next oppor-
tunity compensated thusly : “ Mr. B. Bray, M.C.,
cream - colored pants, black vest, white shirt,
sleeves tucked up, black tie, and no coat; Mr. H.
Jones, sleeves tuckedup.no coat,” &c., &c. Of
course, there are many bush localities where
“ shirt and pants ” would have sufficed for a
costume-description of nine male dancers out of
ten. Clean shirt would have pourtrayed a dude
of the very first water.
A drunken old woman, out of gaol on the
previous Saturday, turned up at Brisbane (Q.)
police-court on the Thursday. Pa Pinnock felt
merciful: “ .£1 or 48 hours.” The old lady turned
to go to her 48 hours, but, looking over her
shoulder, and favoring Pinnock with a wonderful
wink, she said, “Ah, well, you’re not so bad this
morning, old man,” and wandered out. Pinnock’s
lower jaw dropped, his eyes looked into vacancy,
and the court became concerned. Suddenly, his
teeth came together with a snap, and he roared,
“Bring her back.’’ She was brought. “Your
penalty is altered from 48 hours to one month’s
imprisonment. Take her away.” Pinnock has
lost the chivalry of his youth. The wretched old
body only intended to pay him a compliment.
Seen on a day as hot as a furnace, Bernard’s
Swiss Studios, in King - street, Sydney, look
attractively cool and picturesque outside, and
within prove even more of a pleasant refuge than
they had promised. The Studios are the embodi-
ment of Mr. Bernard’s own ideas, and Sydney
ought to be thankful for the delightful in-
novation. The handsome reception - room is
reached by the easiest of stairs ; the ladies’ and
gentlemen’s dressing-rooms are perfectly lighted
and appointed ; but the gallery itself, with its
ladies’ dressing-rooms immediately alongside, is
very praiseworthy. It combines perfect lighting
with remarkable coolness. For this reason alone,
the Studios should become most popular with
ladies. Mr. Bernard intends to keep the price for
12 cabinets (two positions) down to 10s. 6d. ; and
visitors will not be “canvassed,” as they are in
some studios, but will receive every courtesy
instead. Nothing more artistic than the photo-
graphic work at these Studios is to be seen in
Sydney, and this fact can be very easily verified
by inspecting the handsome collection in the vesti-
bule. As the Studios are situated in the very
heart of Sydney, their business should boom.*
A Brisbane (Q.) artisan was out on his
own bail as a drunk. When his name was called
next morning, a pale but determined woman, hug-
ging to her breast a baby, pressed forward—“ Yer
Worsh’p, my husband’s gone to his work so as not
to lose his job, an’ I’ve come to take his place.
He pleads guilty, yer Worsh’p.” “Discharged,”
laconically said the P.M.

lie Beans for Biliousness
A Popular Sailing Enthusiast is Cured
by Bile Beans.
SUFFERED FROM BILIOUS ATTACKS, INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, AND
PAINS AFTER EATING.
PATENT MEDICINES UTTERLY FAIL.
BILE BEANS EFFECT A THOROUGH CURE.
One of the most popular and prominent enthusiasts in yachting is Mr. Joe Thiering, of Darling-
street, Balmain. He is one of the oldest members of the Johnstone’s Bay Sailing Club and the Flying
Squadron, in both of which he has taken an active part for a number of years. He has been sailing
in Sydney for 35 years, and his opinion on this grand sport is
regarded with great esteem. Although Mr. Thiering would be
taken for a strong, healthy man, it was learnt a few days ago
that he had suffered from severe Bilious Attacks, Headaches,
and Indigestion for a number of years. We give below a
letter received from Mr. Thiering stating that he has been com-
pletely cured of these ailments by Bile Beans. Mr. Thiering’s
letter reads as follows :
“ 189 Darling-st., Balmain.
“The Bile Bean Manufacturing Co.,
“ 19 Macquarie Place, Sydney.
“ Dear Sir, —Seeing your Bile Beans advertised, and being
a sufferer from Biliousness, Indigestion, and Constipation oc-
casionally, I decided to give them a trial, and I am pleased to
tell you that they cured me.
“ I was mostly troubled with Bilious Headaches and Indi-
gestion, which compelled me at times to leave off work. A
full feeling and pains across my chest often after my meals were
ailments that troubled me also. Since taking your Bile Beans all these complaints have disappeared,
and I. can now enjoy a good meal without feeling any bad after-effects. I have tried a good many
medicines advertised, but none seemed to give permanent re lief. My family say they are the best
medicine they, have ever taken. I am a blacksmith by trade, and am well known in Balmain. You
can publish this letter ; it may be the means of helping other sufferers.
“ Yours truly,
(Signed) “JOE THIERING.”

Women’s Weakness.
While many of the delicate organs of a woman’s constitution need great attention, there is no
reason why a woman should suffer days of misery every month, when a little care would greatly
minimise, if not absolutely do away with, all pain. Many a woman makes herself a burden to her
husband and friends by her nervous irritability, caused through her own ignorance or neglect. It
stands to reason that a woman who suffers from disorder or weakness of one of the female organs
cannot make a happy, amiable helpmeet to an ambitious man. It is quite easy to keep all the organs
of the body in a healthy, vigorous state, with a little care and attention. Many remedies act in such
a violent manner that their use is more harmful than beneficial. Bile Beans act in a gentle, soothing
manner, and for any woman suffering from weakness of the female organs they are highly recom-
mended. They will probably prove efficient in cases where other remedies have failed, and a course
of them cannot prove otherwise than beneficial.
\V.
Another Melbourne Case.
COMPLETE CURE OE MR. LOUIS MYERS.
SUFFERED FOR YEARS FROM ACUTE INDIGESTION.
“118 Palmerston-st., Carlton, Melbourne,
3rd February, 1898.
“To The Bile Bean Manufaotubing Co.,
“Sydney, N.S.W.
“ Sirs,—Just a few lines to express my gratitude for the relief I have received from your wonderful
medicine. I suffered for a great number of years from acute indigestion, nothing doing me any good.
“In March, 1889, I went to England with the late Henry Searle (the champion sculler of the
world), and tried all kinds of patent medicines and so-called cures without obtaining any relief. A
little while back I was strongly advised by a friend to try your Bile Beans, which I did, and the result
was far beyond my expectations, as I was completely cured. I can strongly recommend them to
anyone suffering as I did.
“Yours gratefully,
v “LOUIS MYERS.”
Working People-
“ With fingers weary and worn, with eyelids heavy and red,”
many a woman is pegging away at a machine or needle, struggling
to make two ends meet. The very nature of the work is apt to un-
dermine the health, and one of the persistent and almost inevitable
results is liver and stomach troubles. Bile Beans are a simple,
safe, and certain remedy that has stood the test of time, and when
used by women who lead a sedentary life, they will be found of
great service. These little Beans will cure all ills that come from
bad digestion and sluggish liver action.
n
v
What Bile Beans Are.
w
FOS\
ILIOUSNESS
Bile Beans owe their existence to the discovery by an
American medical man of a certain vegetable substance
that has the effect on the digestive organs of Nature’s own
animal bile. This discovery is revolutionising all the present
methods of treatment for digestive ailments. The old theory
of pepsin, bismuth, starving, purging, &c., &c., is to be done
away with. This great vegetable substance is compounded
with other ingredients to facilitate the working, and to-day
this remedy can be purchased the world over and in Australia
under the name of Bile Beans for Biliousness. This great
specific possesses the peculiar properties of acting on the
bowels without purging or otherwise weakening the patient,
being so compounded that the substance that relaxes the
bowels has about the same action as the natural bile. Bile
Beans are manufactured in one of the largest and best-
equipped laboratories in the world at Detroit, Michigan,
TJ.S.A. They are sold throughout the world, and are an un-
doubted specific for Biliousness, Headache; Constipation, In-
digestion, Debility, Piles, Sallow Complexion, Female Weak-
ness, Dyspepsia, and All Liver Troubles. For sale at all chemists. Australian Depot, 19 Macquarie
Place, Sydney. Victorian Agents, Rocke, Tompsitb and Co., Flinders-street, Melbourne.
How M‘Dougal Topped the Score.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A peaceful spot is Piper’s Flat. The folk that live
around—
They keep themselves by keeping sheep and turn-
ing up the ground.
But the climate is erratic; and the consequences
are
The struggle with the elements is everlasting war.
We plough, and sow, and harrow —then sit down
and pray for rain ;
And then we all get flooded out and have to start
auain.
But the folk are now rejoicing as they ne’er re-
joiced before,
For we’ve played Molongo cricket, and M’Dougal
topped the score !
Molongo had a head on it, and challenged us to
play
A single-innings match for lunch—the losing team
to pay.
We were not great guns at cricket, but we couldn’t
well say No,
So we all began to practise, and we let the reaping
_ go ’
We scoured the flat for ten miles round to muster
up our men,
But when the list was totalled we could only
number ten.
Then up spoke big Tim Brady: he was always
slow to speak,
And he said —“ What price M‘Dougal, who lives
down at Cooper’s Creek ?
So we sent for old M‘Dougal, and he stated in
reply
That “ he’d never played at cricket, but he’d half
a mind to try.
He couldn’t come to practice—he was getting in
his hay,
But he guessed he’d show the beggars from
,Molongo how to play.”
Now, M'Dougal was a Scotchman, and a canny
-one at that,
So he started in to practise with a paling for a
bat.
He got Mrs. Mac. to bowl him, but she couldn’t
. run at all,
So he trained his sheep-dog, Pincher, how to
scout and fetch the ball.
Now, Pincher was no puppy; he was old, and
worn, and grey;
But lie understood M'Dougal, and —accustomed
to obey—
When M'Dougal cried out “ Fetch it! ”he would
fetch it, in a trice,
But,'until the word was “Drop it!” he would
gi ip it like a vyce.
And each succeeding night they played until the
lit: lit grew dim ;
Sometimes M'Dougal struck the ball —sometimes
the ball struck him !
Eaeh time he struck, the ball would plough a
furrow in the ground,
And when lie missed the impetus would turn him
three times round.
The fatal day at length arrived—the day that
was to see
Molongo bite the dust, or Piper’s Flat knocked up
a tree !
Molongo’s captain won the toss, and sent his men
to bat,
Did they gave some leather-hunting to the men
of I’iper’s Flat.
When the ball sped where M'Dougal stood, firm
planted in its track,
He shut his eyes, and turned him round, and
stopped it—with his back!
The highest score was twenty-two, the total sixty-
six,
When Brady sent a yorker down that scattered
Johnson’s sticks.
Then Piper’s Flat went in to bat, for glory and
renown,
But, like the grass before the scythe, our wickets
tumbled down.
“Nine wickets down for seventeen, with fifty
more to win ! ”
Our captain heaved a heavy sigh, and sent
M'Dougal in.
“Ten pounds to one you lose it! ” cried a barracker
from town ;
But M‘Dougal said “ I’ll tak’ it, mon ! ” and
planked the money down.
Then he girded up his moleskins in a self-reliant
style,
Threw off his hat and boots, and faced the bowler
with a smile.
He held the bat the wrong side out, and Johnson
with a grin
Stepped lightly to the bowling crease, and sent a
“wobbler” in;
M‘Dougal spooned it softly back, and Johnson
waited there,
But M’Dougal, crying “ Fetch it!” started run-
ning like a hare.
Molongo shouted ‘ ‘ Victory ! He’s out as sure as
eggs,”
When Pincher started through the crowd, and
ran through Johnson’s legs.
He seized the ball like lightning; then he ran
behind a log,
And M'Dougal kept on running, while Molongo
chased the dog.
They chased him up, they chased him down, they
chased him round, and then
He darted through a slip-rail as the scorer shouted
“ Ten! ”
M‘Dougal puffed; Molongo swore; excitement
was intense;
As the scorer marked down twenty,. Pincher
Cleared a barbed-wire fence.
“ Let us head him ! ” shrieked Molongo. “ Brain
the mongrel with a bat! ”
“Run it out! Good old McDougal!” yelled
the men of Piper’s Flat.
And McDougal kept on jogging, and then Pincher
doubled back,
And the scorer counted “ Forty ” as they raced
across the track.
McDougal’s legs were going fast, Molongo’s breath
was gone—
But still Molongo chased the dog—McDougal
struggled on.
When the scorer shouted “ Fifty ” then they knew
the chase could cease ;
And McDougal gasped out “Drop it!” as he
dropped within his crease.
Then Pincher dropped the ball, and as instinc-
tively he knew
Discretion was the wiser plan, he disappeared
from view.
And as Molongo’s beaten men exhausted lay
around
We raised McDougal shoulder-high, and bore him
from the ground.
We bore him to M‘Ginniss’s, where lunch was
ready laid,
And filled him up with whisky-punch, for which
Molongo paid.
We drank liis health in bumpers, and we cheered
him three times three,
And when Molongo got its breath, Molongo joined
the spree.
And the critics say they never saw a cricket-match
like that,
When M‘Dougal broke the record in the game at
Piper’s Flat.
And the folk are jubilating as they never were
before;
For we played Molongo cricket, and M‘Dougal
topped the score !
THOS E. SPENCER.
In a lecture at Brisbane, Q. Meteorologist
Wragge “ expressed his particular objection to
being called a ‘weather prophet,’ and explained
that his forecasts are formulated on strictly scien-
tific data, there being no trace of charlatanism
about his work.” Wragge has surrendered him-
self to the gibes of Philistia. Now that people
know that “weather prophet” hurts, “weather
prophet” it is certain to be, by all the gall in
human nature.
Thus “ Sirius,” somewhat condensed :
Ed. Bulletin. —Why abuse N.S.W. Governor Phillip as
a “hanging” official greedy for blood? Why overlook
the conditions by which he was surrounded, and ignore
his good points? Why can’t you be more generous?
That sneering, flippant style of yours just spoils what I
consider otherwise —[jam left to imagination..—Ed. B.]
We all like smartness and snap, bored to death as we are
with the monotony of the dailies. But then, my dear
fellow, there’s the other extreme, and, by George, you’ve
got there. Read Phillip’s life in N.S.W. and you’ll see he
was a man to be rather proud of, if you make proper
allowances for his training in the severe navy school, and
his position as the administrator of a code of Draconian
severity. But please recollect he didn’t make the code.
And why drop also on to Rev. Fish, who probably knows
nothing of the Phillip memorial lately erected at Sydney ?
It isn’t fair, Bulletin, and you know it as well as I do.
[The Bulletin doesn’t go out of its way to
“abuse” Phillip as a “hanging Governor”; it
simply calls attention to the fact that as “ the
administrator of a code of Draconian severity,”
Phillip is not a cheerful or desirable historical cir-
cumstance to recall. Phillip may have had good
points about him—very little is known of the
man one way or the other—but The Bulletin’s
position in the matter is due to a natural disgust
at the flunkey-souled people who can’t exist with-
out having always on hand a cheap hero of one
kind or another, and who are always shrieking to
have the public money expended on a statue to
somebody, for no better reason than that he never
did anything particularly disgraceful; or that
some politician or other wants to whack a com-
mission on the job. And The Bulletin, while
quite willing, for want of evidence to the contrary,
to admit that Phillip was a decent man of his
sort and time—a bad sort and a very horrible
time —finds nothing in all this to justify the
expenditure of (say) £14,000, not of individually-
subscribed, but of Treasury money, upon a monu-
ment to his memory which is neither a credit to
the community nor an ornament to one of the
champion sites of the world.]
“ There is, or was, a S.A. railway-ganger
named Finnigan, very fond of Bending long reports
of trivial occurrences. When he came to town,
the boss remonstrated. ‘Your reports are too
long, Finnigan. For heaven’s sake cut ’em short.’
The next report from Finnigan read': ‘Truck
All 6 off again, on again, gone again.— Finnigan.
P.S.—How’ll that do?’” [P.P.S.—An old Yankee
yarn ; but it will bear transplanting.]
A Wandering Australian : “ Whatever
strength lies behind the Carlist movement in
Spain the Madrid authorities do not attempt to
cloak their preparations for emergency. In the
main streets and outside the public buildings are
posted artillery commanding all the vantage
points. Carlist sympathisers say the gunners are
less trustworthy than the guns, and meanwhile
things float on in the restful Spanish way.
Parisian modes prevail here amongst the women,
who are superior in beauty to the Parisiennes;
the mantilla is only worn at church or at bull
fights, where the cow-killing is nearly as risky to
the killers as tree-felling in the mallee scrub.”
The suburban press is a fearsome institu-
tion, and sometimes achieves notable results. The
suburban press of Melbourne all but destroyed
the Government and bankrupted Victoria at the
beginning of the sittings of tlie third session of
the Federal Convention. It was a Sydney scribe
who made the discovery. He wandered non-
chalantly into the refreshment-room at Melb.
House of Assembly and called for whisky-and-
soda, tendering a shilling. The coin was refused,
and it was painfully explained to him that the
Govt, had resolved to treat the press engaged
during the sittings of the Convention purely as
guests. Everything was to be free. The indis-
creet journalist mentioned the fact to himself in
the arctic privacy of his own room, and the news
went forth. Browning’s rats were nothing to it.
The pressmen swarmed up from cellar and down
from attic. Forgotten scribes of past decades
emerged from their Caves of Adullam ; dipso-
maniacal scribblers gulped buckets of chloride of
gold and hurried to the scene of conflict; the very
churchyards yawned, and dead journalists gathered
their bones together and rushed to represent at
the Convention papers published in Hades. And
the Government acted right royally—for one
week. There was no .stint’ in eating.. or
drinking, or smoking. The tables absolutely
murmured at the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind
piled thereon. There were oysters from Britain,
lampreys from the fish-pools of Lucullus, larks’-
tongues from the aviaries of Claudius Csesar, tur-
bot from the larder of Brillat-Savarin’s friend, the
Italian Cardinal, sturgeon from Norway, frogs
from M&con, and caviare from the General. The
rarest vintages of France were at the disposal of
ragged paragraphists ; cigars of the most fragrant,
appallingly Cuban brands were provided, and
gold-tipped cigarettes, at five shillings a dozen,
were pocketed by the handful. But when some 70
scribes scrambled for fish costing three guineas a
plate, and arrogantly refused to ! be denied ; when
they poured champagne into the finger-glasses,
and lit big aromatic cigars with gilt-edged menus,
and carried home roast birds-of-paradise for the
regalement of the landlady, the Government
sadly, but firmly, put its foot down, and an-
nounced, more in sorrow than in anger, that the
orgy was over and the Convention’s free counter-
lunch closed down. As it was expressly explained
to one complaining journalistic dead-beat by the
official in charge: “No Government could stand
it. Why, if we went on like this Victoria would
be up the spout within a fortnight. As it is ! ’

Cripples All!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There's a jaunty generation that goes limping
thro’ the land,
And it calls itself a nation, and it bids its chest
" expand ;
It grows fat with satisfaction on a pile of borrowed
gold,
And it droops in dull inaction, tho’ its tongue is
triple-bold ;
It’s a race that’s fond of wailing of the yoke it has
to bear ;
It’s a race that’s always failing when it has to do
and dare ;
It’s a race of bending backbones tho’ its talk is
stiff and tall;
It’s a race of men on crutches, and we dub them
Cripples All!
There’s a crew of cringing creatures that go always
cap in hand,
And their meek, submissive features bear the milky
craven brand ;
They’ve a pulse that’s always steady when the
good man meets a fall;
They’ve a right arm ever ready when the Lords of
Money call;
They’ve a God above—they fear Him and they love
Him (so they say),
They’ve a devil and they jeer him, for the Devil’s
had his day ;
Never front they give a foeman—never breast they
give a brawl —
They’re a crowd that go on crutches —and we dub
them Cripples All!
There’s a tribe all bent and pallid, who by lying
lip and pen,
Daily prove the Deed invalid that asserted they
were men :
Tribe whose tongue is ever supple, and whose ink
is never dry,
Who’ve a front of brass quadruple and an ever-
shifty eye;
And ’tis theirs to sing the paean when Sir Midas
sweeps along,
Theirs to hail the gilded scion of a harlot with a
song,
Theirs to fight beneath the table with the dogs of
Dives' hall,
Till they totter home on crutches —like a band of
Cripples All !
There’s a troop of vot’ries fearful all a-crouch be-
neath a creed,
There are Women-faces tearful (are there men in
such a breed ?),
And a tale of driv’lling Ages by a People’s dotage
bred
All the puny mind encages till the puny soul ia
dead,
Till a priestly incantation is the People’s chiefest
trust,
Till they kneel, a nidd’ring nation, to a Deity of
Dust,
Till a symbol, void of virtue, holds the bending
throng in thrall—
Now —what are they with their crutches but a
band of Cripples All?
And the knaves who flag and falter when they
bear the battle-drum,
And the puling gang who palter when the clarion
bids them “ Come ! ”
And the fatted fools who barter on the highways
day by day
All the freeman’s glorious charter for a bauble
cheap and gay,
And the timid ones who tremble at the things upon
the throne,
And the dastards who dissemble till the blast be
overblown,
And the Little Men of Little Soul whom Little
Things appal—
Now, what are they with their crutches but a band
of Cripples All ?
Brisbane.
P. LUFTIG.
A Woman’s Reason.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Yes,” said the doctor, thoughtfully, “I
have had cases of some psychological,, interest,
though not exactly the kind given as doctors’
experiences in well-bred English magazines. Here
is one. It starts off like an old story, but—;
however, you will see for yourself. As I was say-
ing a moment ago, women are . Never mind,
you can pick out the moral later on.”
* * * *
I was leaving my consulting-room one
cold afternoon when, anticipating the servant’s
announcement, my old school friend, James
Hutchison, came hurriedly into the apartment. I
gave him a hearty welcome. I had just returned
from a holiday tour ; consequently had not seen
him for several months. That period, so full of
pleasure for me, had brought him bitter experi-
ence. However, that was now a thing of the past.
Some new trouble ? He flung down his hat, and
threw himself on a chair. “Ned, old fellow, I’ve
come to you about my wife.”
His voice was hoarse and strained. I could not
help noticing how old and grey he looked ; but
that was natural, very natural, after what he had
undergone.
“Come, Jim,” reassuringly; “ your wife is in
good hands. Why, I heard, coming back in the
train, how well she was looking; and, even if
there is a slight relapse ”
He interrupted me with some impatience.
“ She’s quite well—bodily. You heard all about
it then ? ”
“ Of her terrible sufferings—lost in the bush —
and her narrow escape from death by starvation ?
Why, the newspapers were full of it, Jim ! And
didn’t I wire my congratulations when I heard
that they had found her at last ? ”
“All my fault,” he muttered, unheeding. “I
left her too much alone. You know how it is
with us men, Ned. It’s not that we love our
wives less; it’s only that we forget to speak of
it; and they—they don’t understand.”
I poured him out a glass of wine. “ Maybe I’m
prejudiced, old fellow, but it always struck me
you made a capital husband.”
“ Do I ? ” with a sudden, unsteady laugh. He
drank the liquor at one draught. “ Not half
such a bad sort, am I ? Eh ? Look at me ? Not
much deteriorated since I married Nellie, three
years ago ? If I went courting again, courting a
young, delicate creature like Nellie, I’d have a
chance, eh? . . . No, I’m not mad, Ned, or
drunk. I’ve had to go courting again these last
two months, courting Nellie, my wife; because—
she’s forgotten me, forgotten everything that
happened before her awful experience, forgotten
me, her husband.”
After a little he was able to explain the matter
at length. Mrs. Hutchison was in no sense in-
sane. Simply a sponge had been passed over the
whole life anterior to the illness that followed her
wanderings in the bush. She had had to learn
everything over again. Hutchison grew calm and
even interested as he mentioned the things she
could do, as it were instinctively, and the other
things, reading and writing for instance, which
she was painfully acquiring anew. He had hoped
that this mental affection would prove only tem-
porary, but that now seemed vain. She had con-
sented, after much persuasion, to avoid scandal
by remaining in her husband’s house. He was
full of gratitude to her for her courage.
“ But can’t I see how dreadful it is for her, my
poor darling,” he muttered brokenly, “it’s like
living in the house alone with a stranger. She
must address as her husband and be, at least
before others, on terms of intimacy with a man,
who is, as far as she can realise, a mere two-
months’ acquaintance. I’m as kind to her as I
can be, but it’s like a knife to see her shrink away
if I only touch her hand ; and I’ve got to be a
gentleman to her,” with a hysterical laugh, “when
I want to be a husband.”
He pulled himself together with an effort. Such
emotion was unusual to his strong nature.
A slight pause, and he looked towards me again.
“ You will come ? ” he questioned ; “ you will tell
me if you see any chance of—of ”
“ Of memory returning ? Frankly ”
“ No, no ! ’’—impatiently. He raised his hand
as if to hide the slow flush on his rugged face—
“ any chance of her loving me again.”
Ten minutes later we had left the house, and
half an hour found us ushered into the pretty
drawing-room of young Mrs. Hutchison. Never
had the red firelight shone on a more charming
face and figure as she rose languidly from her low
chair to welcome us. One of Nature’s butterflies—
I had already classified her brainless and beautiful
—with soft, appealing eyes, doubly appealing now.
Though I had met her so often before, a new
introduction was necessary. She greeted me with
a little natural restraint; her husband with a
pathetic mingling of timidity and dawning affec-
tion. I thought Jim’s chances particularly good.
I stayed an hour chatting to both. She-was
nervous and low-spirited at first, feeling her
affliction keenly, but presently brightened up.
Once, when the rain began to fall, I went to the
window to look out. When I turned, Jim had
taken the seat next his wife, and both heads were
bent over a book. Mrs. Hutchison had been look-
ing at the illustrations, and now Jim was helping
her to spell out the letterpress. Presently I saw
him gently put his arm round her waist. She
drew back at first, then yielded, and suffered him
to press her head against his shoulder. Jim
glanced at me with a smile of tremulous happi-
ness. She followed his glance and blushed deeply.
“ Jim is teaching me to read,” she said, “such
an interesting story. Fancy, I’ve got to wait
till he comes home every evening to see what
happens next.”
Her childishness made us both laugh. It re-
lieved us to see that she could still be happy.
A little while later, Jim slipped from the room.
With an apology to my hostess I quickly followed
him. As I spoke the words of excuse I saw her
give a slight start. The room was now darkening,
and for a moment she must have fancied herself
quite alone. I found Jim in the hall, looking for
something that obviously was not there. He
lifted a flushed, happy face at my approach.
“ Well,” he said huskily ; “ well ? ”
I did not heed the implied question.
“Jim, my friend,” I said quietly ; “I’ve got a
plan to restore your wife’s memory. Just stay
here, and let me speak to her a few minutes.”
Without waiting for an answer, I re-entered.
Mrs. Hutchison was standing by the mantel-
piece. One black, slippered foot caressed the
fender. She was humming a tender little love-
song. Her face was radiant.
“ Well, Mrs. Hutchison,” I advanced towards
her. “ When is this farce to end ? ”
Her face changed : “ What—farce ? ”
“ This infamous deception of a good husband,
if you like it better.”
I expected some denial. She capitulated at
once.
“ Oh, don’t tell him,” she whispered. In her
agitation her voice seemed to desert her. “He
would never forgive me, never speak to me again.
Oh ! how—how did you ever find me out ? ”
“ Perhaps it was that hasty glance at the last
page of the novel when you thought no one wai
looking. Anyway ”
“ But you won’t tell him, will you, and break
his heart, dear doctor ? ” Her slim fingers touched
my arm. “I’m not deceitful, really, doctor. I
didn’t get lost in the bush on purpose,” she went
on in her pretty silly way. “ The idea came to
me when I found myself safe at home, and for a
little while really had forgotten. And,” here my
shoulder was deserted, the hands being wanted to
manipulate a delicate lace handkerchief ; “ and so
I thought I’d just pretend and keep it up, and—
and ”
“But what did you do it for?” I looked at
her in amazement —such a weak, hysterical little
creature, so evidently meant for pettings and
caressings, and for nothing deeper.
The handkerchief was rolled into a wet little
ball. She gave a final sob.
“ Jim was getting so cold, so silent,” she said ;
“and so I thought I would enjoy my courting
over again ! ”
M.L.
CONSTANCE CLYDE.
A daring correspondent :
Among 1 the Lenten pastorals in Victoria, that of the
Bishop of Bendigo seizes most upon me, with divorce as
its burning question. Marriage a sacrament, and no
divorce, is a sheet-anchor of the Roman Church. It strikes
me there ought to be some kind of legal eoncul inage—
which would be entirely Scriptural. The Word only im-
poses its awful sanctions on marriage. Facility of divorce
impairs the value of every marriage, and people enter on
the sacred relationship with a determination that it shall
only be a weatherboard habitation.
According to Macdonald-Paterson, senior
M. for Brisbane North (Q.), who has repre-
sented that capital for nearly a year by touring in
Britain and elsewhere, the best meat on the
English market, superior even to Scotch or
English beef, is—American. He seems to say
nothing at all about Australian.

“For three years my daughter Edith suffered terribly with Sa.vt "Rheum,
which affected chiefly her hands, and for nearly six months at a time
was constantly compelled to wear gloves. Her hands were covered with
blisters, full of a watery substance; the skin would often peel off, and the
itching and burning were intense. I paid doctors’ bills without number
and bought medicines of all kind; but all failed to give relief until I tried
AYER’S SARSAPARILLA. After using this medicine a short time an
improvement was manifest, and my daughter took in. all ten bottles,—
<? ntinuing it even after all signs of her affliction had disappeared. The
irsaparilla purified her blood, radically curing the disease, and we are
nost thankful for this great blessing.”
Be sure that you get the genuine

The wonderful success of this great blood purifier has led to numerous

German Gold Mining Company has used Griefen *
dorff’s “ KEPItO ” to paint the inside of our
Cyanide Vats to save the timber from absorbing the
cyanide and gold liquor. We are pleased to state
that we found it admirably suited for that purpose,
a/nd can safely recommend it to others. __
