MOIRA O’NEILL
THESE verses of hers were here
reprinted when they appeared in
Blackwood ’s; yet since they recur in-
sistently they may be printed again for
addition to the 'treasure of a chance literary
wayfarer. The little book that holds
them, Songs of the Glens of Antrim, has
passed through ten impressions since 1900 :
they are simple verses, yet so rare in art and
accent that you may search twenty books of
the Irish school without finding an analogue.
The use of dialect adds a beauty. English
water seems hard and cold besides the soft
Irish wather:
When she’d come laughin’ ’twas the runnin’
wather...
The words are admirably chosen and placed,
and a strong rhythmical beat fixes their mes-
sage ; the subjects are familiar characters, old
instincts, homely longings, the tender voices
of the past heard through regretful years.
The author does not express passions, is
content with sentiments, yet her light shafts
linger in yearning hearts ; and indeed her
verses are a kind of religion.
CORRYMEELA.
Over here in England I ’m helpin’ wi’ the hay,
An’ I wislit I was in Ireland the livelong day ;
Weary on the English hay, an’ sorra take the
wheat!
Och ! Corrymeela an’ the blue ski/ over it!
There’s a deep dumb river flowin’ by beyont the
heavy trees,
This livin’ air is moithered wi’ the bummin’ o’
the bees;
I wisht I’d hear the Claddagh burn go runnin’
I through the heat
Past Corrymeela, wi’ the blue sky over it..
The people that’s in England is richer nor the
Jews,
There’s not the smallest young gossoon but thravels
in his shoes !
I *d give the pipe between me teeth to see a barefut
child !
Och / Corrymeela an’ the low south wind.
Here’s hands so full o’ money an’ hearts so full o’
care,
By the luck o’ love ! I’d still go light for all I did
go bare.
“ God save ye, colleen dhas,” I said : the girl she
thought me wild.
Far Corrymeela, an' the low south wind.
D’ ye mind me now, the song at night is mortial
hard to raise,
The girls are heavy goin’ here, the boys are hard
to plase ;
When ones’t I’m out this workin’ hive, ’tis I’ll
be back again—
Ay, Corrymeela, in the same soft rain.
The puff o’ smoke from one ould roof before an
English town !
For a shauyh wid Andy Feelan here I’d give a
silver crown,
For a curl o’ hair like Mollie’s ye ’ll ask the like
in vain,
Sweet Corrymeela, an’ the same soft rain.
“The Ould Lad.”
I mind meself a wee boy wi’ no plain talk,
An’ standin’ not the height o’ two peats ;
There was things meself consated ’or the time that
I could walk,
An* who’s to tell when wit and childer meets ?
’Twas the daisies down in the low grass,
The stars high up in the skies,
The first IJmowed of a mother’s face
IWi’ the kind love in her eyes,
Och, och!
The kind love in her eyes.
I went the way of other lads that’s neither good
nor bad,
An’ still, d’ ye see, a lad has far to go ;
But the things meself consated when I wasn’t
sick nor sad,
They ’re aisy told, an’ little use to know.
’Twas whiles a boat on the say beyont,
An’ whiles a girl on the shore,
An’ whiles a scrape o’ the fiddle-strings,
Or maybe an odd thing more.
In troth,
Or maybe an odd thing more.
A man, they say, in spite of all, is betther for a
wife,
In-undher this ould roof I live me lone ;
I never seen the woman yet I wanted all me life,
An’ I never made me pillow on a stone.
’T-is “fancy buys the ribbon” an’ all,
An" fancy sticks to the young ;
But the man of his years can do wi’ a pipe,
Gan smoke an’ hould his tongue,
D’ ye mind.
Smoke an’ hould his tongue.
Ye see me now an ould man, his work near done,
Sure the hair upon me head’s gone white;
But the things meself consated ’or the time that I
could run,
They ’re the nearest to me heart this night.
Just the daisies down in the low grass,
The stars high up in the skies,
The first I knowed of a mother’s face
Wi’ the kind love in her eyes,
Och, och!
The kind love in her eyes.
SAID THE MAN FROM JEWBURG
IT ’S not as bad a place as you make it out
to be—Johannesburg. I know there’s
lots have n’t done too well there; but
plenty has. You get the yarns of the
men who do badly : the men who do well
don’t write. I’ve done pretty well myself ;
I’m not denying it. I put in live years there
—carpenter, builder, contractor, and all
sorts of odd jobs : I admit a man has to be a
tradesman to get on. If you ’re not, you
starve, unless you can put on a silk hat and
a frock-coat and live up to them. I landed
here a fortnight ago, but there’s nothing to
do here. I’ve looked round Adelaide, Mel-
bourne, Sydney —they’re all dead; bad spirit,
no encouragement. So I’m off over to
Fr’isco next boat.
There’s not many Australians in Africa
when you add them up, but you’d think
they run the place, they make such a lot of
noise. That’s the fault of them :it gets
them disliked, they can’t keep their mouths
shut. Yes, I’m Australian myself, though I
do wander round. You know an Australian
at once over there: lie’s as different
from the Englishman as an American
is. The Australians do just as well
as anybody else, and a bit better
than most : they ’re too smart for the
Englishman, that’s why he dislikes them.
You ;sea, over here a man has plenty of
friends, and he takes it easy. If you lose
your job, you’ve grown up with Tom, Dick,
and Harry, and they ’ll find you a job. Over
there it’s different: you’ve no friend but
yourself, and everybody waiting to rob you.
So the Australian finds himself on the edge
of a hole, and he hits out, and no blame to
him. When he’s got to fight, he can fight
better than'most of them, and that’s why
they howl.
It’s a country of thieves and liars. I
reckon I was honest enough when I went
over there, but after I’d been robbed once
or twice I saw I had to turn to and do a bit
of robbing myself. It’s either that or clear
out. They’ve no use for honesty in Johan-
nesburg : it’s run by the Jews on the prin-
ciple of collar what you can. I found the
Jews all right—the best kind of them : I’ve
nothing to complain of. They ’ll have you
if they can, but it’s what I gall a fair have ;
and you know what to look out for. I
would n’t say they have better brains
than Australians ; but they’ve got
better energy. That’s what I admire
about them, their persistent energy. The
Australian takes a rest now and then : the
Jew goes all the time. Of course there’s a
terrible lot of the other sort over there—what
they call Russian and Peruvian Jews : they’d
rob you of threepence as soon as your back’s
turned. Nothing’s too bad for them.
I Once you know them, you know Russia is
the only country that deals with them
properly : they ’re only fit for wiping out.
I don’t know what’s going to become of
the country : nobody knows. It ’ll never be
an English country as long as you live. The
Englishman only goes there for what
Ihe can make, and clears out. The English
aren’t ten per cent, of the white popu-
lation, after all the fuss. It’s a Dutch-
man’s country, Dutchmen and natives.
Nobody knows what ’ll turn up. The Boers
won’t say anything, won’t say what they
want or what they ’re going to do : nobody
knows. I like the Boers : they ’re a bit
thick in the head, but they’re a simple,
decent crowd. You don’t find them in
Johannesburg. Mines ? Well, there you
are. They’ve got Chinese labour now, at a
bob a day, and still it costs them 255. a ton
to raise and crush the stone. And the best
stone they’ve got isn’t worth more than 655.
a ton, with a two-foot reef. Not much in
that when you come to chase it down, consider-
ing all the capital invested. They’ve got
pretty well all the surface stuff, and whether
deep sinking is going to pay, with all their
cheap labour, is pretty doubtful. The Chows
are just slaves, of course, and they’re not doing
too well, not as well as the Kaffirs : you can’t
drive ’em past a certain point. The Kaffir
was just as cheap, but he would n’t hire for
more than three months : that’s where the
trouble was. The Chows go there for three
years, live or die, and too many of them are
dying : bringing up the expenses.
Sydney seems slow after Johannesburg :
your people have n’t got their heads pro-
perly screwed. You try to make a trade
over here, and then .you kill it by not look-
ing after it. Part of my time I was in the
cold storage business—another swindle ; and
a consignment of fowls came over from
Sydney : the boss showed ’em to me : good
birds all right, and their heads hacked off
and the blood let drip all over them—
shippers had n’t the sense to keep them
clean and attractive. Down went the price
a bob—just on the looks of them, see ? All
the Australian stuff is more or less like that
—good stuff spoilt for want of nous in
handling, or else no reliance on the quality
—first shipment tip-top, next rotten. And
there you are !
Well, I called in for some American papers,
not to gas like this.
FLOTSAM
Tolstoy’s new play, as translated and per-
formed in London, is summarised by a Times
critic: — «
A peasant woman, with the encouragement of an old
hag, poisons her husband in order that she may marry
her lover, a farm labourer. So soon as the farm labourer
[who, by way of hors d'oeuvre, has already seduced and
abandoned a village girl) is married and in possession lie
squanders his wife’s money, takes to drink, and takes his
wife’s step-daughter for his new mistress. By-and-by the
nistress gives birth to a child, which the wife, the hag,
and the farm labourer bury alive. Then the man con-
fesses, is handed over to the police, and the play—or
rather the nightmare—is over.
It is pretty, but is it Art ? That is what, occupied
with their personal sensations, the critics fail to
;ell us. One receives fresli light on the remarkable
[Russian peasant, a new reflection of the Age of
[?aith, and the critics object to the “ crack-crack -
ng ” of the bones of the infant undergoingmurder.
Tolstoy’s retort might be inferred. You can’t
make a moral Russian omelette without breaking
infants’ bones.
Lond. Times, by the way, has been engaging its
readers in “heart-to-heart talks” regarding'the
best means of ridding Olympus of wnite ants.
Jove the thunderer lending an affable ear to the
prattle of a worsh ipper is a sweet spectacle. W here
will this democratic spirit end ? That not all the
worshippers have gropers’ souls is seen in their
attitude toward ad vts., so naif, so noble. One likes
the readers who say that ad vts. are nuisances, and
ask that they should be placed in a separate sup-
plement for convenience of throwing-away. Better
still is the reader who suggests that all advertise-
ments, except possibly Births, Marriages, and
Deaths, and theatres, should be refused by The
Times, as they are “ probably of little general
interest except to the advertiser.”
Prof. Lounsbury, discussing “honour,” points
out that the forms honour and honor sprang up
side by side in Anglo French, and have flourished
together from the fourteenth century till to-day.
The spelling honor is no late Americanism, but good
old English : honour is no less and no more legiti-
mate. And as to current usage, you pay your
pleasure and take your choice. One’s own pre-
ference of honour has this reason : that it looks
better. It yields to the eye a rounder, fuller
image than honor, which seems “tight” and
meagre by'comparison. Pronounce it “honnoor”
and it sounds better than “fionner'” or “ honhor,”
because we have a long vowel-sound in place of a
short; and we want to preserve rich vowel-sounds
in English for the sake of the music and dignity of
speech and poetry. Then there is a reason of associ-
tion: now that one has grown up with honoicr, how
barren appears
I could not love thee, dear, so much
Loved I not honor more.
The thought has lost the rich odour, the sweet
savour, that comes with honour. And, finally,
the tendency to throw back accent is giving us
too many clipped and ugly monosyllables: the
language will lose variety if we do not try to
preserve words with sonorous or fair-seeming
endings. A word, like a yacht, wants a clear
“run” if it is to cut a picturesque figure or swim
suavely in waves of melody. Honour sails past
the eye like a swan, and august advances to the
ear with the dignity of a grave monarch in his
coronation robes. Honor is a bird plucked of its
tail-feathers, au'gust is a vulgar little boy in a
hurry : do you not feel it ?
The Saturday Review praises a Belgian critic’s
conclusion that the philosophic value of Swin-
burne’s poetry resides not in content but in form :
“it is breathed from the accent of a verse,
launched like an arrow from the quivering of a
stanza, or shed like a halo from the-silence that
follows. It is by virtue of rhythm that Swin-
burne reaches the vision transcendent, achieves
the metaphysical, power of divination. In him
the Absolute is manifested in the shapes of Num-
ber and Music only: his God descends in
a song.” The Salwrdag accepts this dictum
as a new revelation: but does it Contain any-
thing more than the old testimony ? Swinburne
is a technician: there is value in technic: and
then? The point is whether technic holds all the
value of poetry, or the chief value ; and one says
No, of course. The emotion received from
Number and Music is not to be preferred to the
emotion received from Ideas, much less to the
emotion received from Ideas plus Number and
Music. Yield. Swinburne all the poetic crafts-
man’s laurels and he will still have to win the
crown of the poetic artist.
H. S. Power, an Adelaide painter, offered by
auction at Lawson’s Sydney robms on 23rd Feb.
a catalogue of 90 paintings, chiefly in <pil. The
bidding was so poor that the sale was
after some thirty lots had been withdrawn or
sold for a ridiculous guinea or two.\ The
work deserved a better-reception. Up to a per-
tain point it was uncommonly good. Power paints
with sympathy, and his studies of cows and
horses are especially clever; in pure land-
scape he does not reach the same value. A
genuine Australian sentiment inspires his work,
though the touch is usually modern French. But
there is no market for pictures in Sydney at
present, and the better the work the less the
chance of sale.

Hurrah for Darley ! Harley lets us live:

THE POPR, AND KELLY
!IHIS is purely a personal expression of
opinion regarding the Pope, and re-
- garding Kelly. In the matter of reli-
gion, I am not concerned with the
oe : I am not concerned with Kelly,
ery man has a right to his own re-
qh • ©very religion has a right to its
li man. Identity of religious beliefs is not
ential to good citizenship. If Kelly will
der to Cresar the things that are Ciesar’s,
•ill render to the Pope the things that are
Pope’s. That is partly scripture, and
•tly common sense.
Jut what is the Pope’s ? Is Australia the
pe’s? In effect, Kelly says so. Kelly
s a delegate to the recent Labour Confer-
■e in Sydney. He opposed Socialism not
the ground that it was theoretically un-
ind, not on 'the ground that it was lus-
ically indefensible, not on the ground
t it was practically impossible, but on the
mnd that the Pope had sent round a letter
linst it. He listened to Home, and
dined to listen to reason.
But Socialism is a plan of civil govern-
jnt. It is not a plan of ecclesiastical
vernment. It has nothing to do with
wen or hell, or ways and means of getting
3 ve. It is not a matter of religious belief,
does not deny liberty of conscience. Con-
piently it is Ccesar’s affair, not the Pope’s.
As Collectivism, I oppose Socialism too.
it I oppose it because I do not think it
11 pay Australia to adopt it. I believe the
ate can make just laws, and reform unjust
es. It can open and keep open to all the
enues of industry. It can protect the
;ak against the strong. It cannot make all
ual, but it can give to all equal opportuni-
>s. It can place the poor man’s child and
e rich man’s child on the same footing of
.tural ability. It can tax the inheritances
the wealthy for the benefit of the labourers
r whose efforts they are partly amassed. It
n prevent by legislation the evils arising
am the monopoly of laud. It can experi-
entally aid co-operative production. But
cannot ensure human happiness while
iman egoism remains a constant factor,
he world can only be bettered by better men.
My opposition to Collectivism may be
rong or’ right, but it is reasonable,
oily's opposition is unreasonable. In his
rblished statement, he says : “I humbly
;cept his [the Pope’s] pronouncement
gainst Socialism as an article of faith. ...
Whatever views I had on that fascinating
lbject anterior to the publication of the
ncyclical on labour and socialism,
ren I have been against socialism.” In
dier words, Kelly has abandoned his right
t private judgment on a civil question at
re bidding of the head of his religion. -On
civil question, Kelly refuses to think for
iinself: Ire permits the Pope to do his
kinking.
Clearly, Kelly is a bad citizen.
Why ? Because, in the matter of the
overnment of Australia!, a matter which is
ot a religious matter, lie does not put
Liistralia first. He puts the Pope first,
’hat is bad citizenship.
Kelly is a bad citizen because, in the
ratter of the- temporal government of his
ountry, he pays allegiance to a foreign
.ower. He accepts the commands of a-foreign
uthority as to how he shall or shall nofaper-
orm his duty of Australian, citizenship.
Kelly is a bad citizen, because he accepts
he principle of religious interference in civil
;overnment.. Experience proves that free-
Lonr of conscience and equality of citizenship
mder the law are incompatible with religious
nterference in civil government. Witness
Italy. ...
Kelly is a bad citizen because he dehb-
irately puts his mind in chains- Chained
ninds shrivel to the limits of their chains.
Almost inevitably the denial of civil liberty
follows the acceptance of religious tyranny,
rhe man who casts his vote as “an act ot
faithis presently found incapable of casting
his vote as an act of reason. Yet tne
principle of the government of Australia,
the principle of self-government by equal
citizens for the common benefit, depends
necessarily upon the exercise of
Democratic government by “ anaetot tan
in the Pope is unthinkable.
For" these reasons and others Kelly is a
bad citizen. Yet men of his creed have
been good citizens, men of his race have
been among the best citizens Australia ever
had. They have not found their civil duty
to Australia incompatible with their
duty to the **£**«£* &S 5

My Loves.
Her eyes were brown as a deep rock pool,
Where golden sunbeams play ;
I dreamt I had found my love at last,
But I kissed her, and sailed away.
Her eyes were blue as the sky at noon,
She tried to say me nay;
I held her close and swore my vows;
I loved, but I rode away.
O, deep were her eyes as a moonless night,
She spurned my heart as clay;
But they haunt ine still, those sad, wet eyes.
When I lied, and came away.
O, wide were her wistful eyes in pain
(’Twas ’twixt the dawn and the day);
She thought my love a wondrous thing ;
I vowed, but I stole away.
O, grey were her eyes, and strangely sweet.
Humbled, I knelt to pray;
For love, my love, had bloomed at last!
But she smiled and went away.

CARO.
Mariana.
Mariana ! thou hast seen me, standing in the
garden,
While a circling wheel of pigeons flew, at pleasure,
round the sun,
And the virgin daisy, like a tiny star of pardon,
Hung enjewelled in a cobweb which the loom of
Mab had spun.
Thou hast seen me, Mariana, at the fountain
linger,
Where the overbending loquat turned the bubllea
into gold ;
And the lily sent a slender silver-frosted finger
Thro’ her secret little window with a million leaves
enscr oiled.
Mariana! thou hast seen me laughing in the
orchard
While I freed the sparrow, fainting, on the twig
besmeared with lime,
And the shadow of the dial in the ancient court-
yard V .
Marked the happy, happy hour to the tall clock-
! tower's chime.
Thou hast seen me, Mariana, on the terrace
weeping,
As the stars, born in the sunlight, rose like vestals
to the moon ;
Arid the tiny Jack-o’-l m thorn showed the kraken
sleeping
’Mid the scarlet tufted rushes of the wonderful
lagoon.
Mariana! O, believe me, all my mirth and madness
Found their birthdays in the image of some fantasy
of thee.
Mariana ! tell me : Will there be as much of glad-
ness
In the lovely love thy lovely hands do
love of me ?

HUGH MOCRAK.
Number Three.
This is a song of a grey-eyed maid
And an engine black and new—
They make life glide on an easy grade
And all the world seems true.
The girl lives out by the railway line
Where the Baldwin engine goes;
And, whoever may doubt that girl is mine,
That Baldwin engine knows.
I tell my friends I am studying
The style of the Yankee “ tank.”
They answer, “ Yes, she’s a dainty thing,”
And call me an engine-crank,
Saying, “Beware, she is luring you—
Great is her witchery.”
I wonder if they’re alluding to
The girl or to Number Three.
I take her out in the moonlight sweet—
The girl, I mean—and we
Plan pleasant ways till we hear the beat,
Afar, of the engine “3.”
Then I say good-night and she says good-bye—
I pause and ask what she said ;
“Nothing,” she answers, “you’ll have to fly,”
But I turn back instead.
And my heart flares up in a spurt of sparks
That would stagger a fire-brigade,
While Number Three makes coarse remarks
As she comes up the heavy grade.
I dream I’m adrift near a love-lit sea
On a river with grey-eyed banks,
Till there comes a clarion call for me
(The voice this time is the “tank’s”).
Then a voice, so sweet that it seems to flow
Like silver and rippling pearls,
Whispers to me that I must not go
(This time the voice is the girl’s).
I must not go and I must not stay—
Was ever man placed like me ?
Loth to leave those eyes of grey
And deafened by Number Three ?
Then I tear away from that girl of mine
(I’ve taken out patent rights),
And I hurl my feet for the railway line
And the twinkling station lights.
I never trained for a hundred yards,
And I’d much prefer to sit.
But if ever my name is on the cards,
You put your boots on it.
’Tis but a tale of a little maid
And a big, black Baldwin “ tank ” ;
They make life move on an easy grade,
Like a swinging engine-crank.
The girl is “one,” and I am “two,”
The engine is number “three”—
That three is a crowd isn’t always true—
With us ’tis a trinity.

And Other Itching, Burning,
scaly Eruptions with
Loss of Hair.
Speedy Cure Treatment,
Bathe the affected parts with Hot Water and Cutlcura Soap, to
Cleanse the surface of crusts and scales, and soften the thickened
cuticle. Dry, without hard rubbing, and apply Cuticura Ointment
freely, to allay itching, irritation, and inflammation, and soothe and
heal, and lastly take Cuticura Resolvent Pills, to cool and cleanse the
blood. A single set is often sufficient to cure the most torturing, dis-
figuring, Itching, burning, scaly, pimply humours, eczemas, rashes,
irritations, and chafings, with loss of hair, when all else falls.
The agonizing itching and burning of the skin, as in eczema; the fright-
ful scaling, as in psoriasis; the loss of hair and crusting of the-scalp, as in-
Ecalledhead; the facial disfigurement, as in pimples and ringworm; the
awful suffering of infants and the anxiety of worn-out parents, as in milk
crust, tetter, and salt rheum, all demand a remedy of almost superhuman
virtues to successfully cope with them. Such are the Cuticura remedies,
the purest, sweetest, most speedy and economical curatives for the skin,
scalp, and blood ever compounded. Mothers are their warmest friends.
Miliionsof Women Use Cuticura Soap
Assisted by Cuticura Ointment for preserving, purifying, and beautify-
ing the skin, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the
stopping of falling hair, lor softening, whitening, and soothing red, rough,
and sore hands, for baby rashes and chafings, in the form of baths for
annoying irritations and inflammations of women, or too free or offensive
perspiration, in the form of washes for ulcerative weaknesses, and many
sanative, antiseptic purposes which readily suggest themselves, as well as
for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery.
CUTICURA RESOLVENT PILLS
(Chocolate Coated) are a new, tasteless,
odourless, economical substitute forthecele-
brated liquid Cpticura Resolvent, as well as for all other blood purifiers and humour
cures. Put up in screw-cap pocket vials, containing 60 doses,

WHAT IS CATARRH?
f
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose ami adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
i sight and hearing, destroys
| ihe sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge,passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-

It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1905.
PUBLIC OPINION, LTD.
Journalism comes first to be a party weapon and then a
commercial speculation, carried on without conscience or
scruple, like other commercial speculations. ... A news-
paper is not supposed to enlighten its readers, but to
supply them with congenial opinions. . . . Napoleon’s
sublime aphorism, suggested by his study of the Conven-
tion, “No one individual is responsible for a crime com-
mitted collectively,” sums up the whole significance of a
phenomenon, moral or immoral, whichever you please.
However shamefully a newspaper may behave, the disgrace
attaches to no one person. . . . We shall see newspapers,
started in the first instance by men of honor, falling
sooner or later into the hands of men of abilities even
lower than the average, but endowed with the resistance
and flexibility of indiarubber, qualities denied to noble
genius; nay, perhaps the future- newspaper proprietor
will be the tradesman with the capital sufficient to buy
venal pens.— Balzac (prophetically ) in “On Grand
Homme de Province a, Paris.”
Expression of public opinion in England has
been strong enough to force Mr. Harmsworth,
the man who is ten daily “ we’s” and a score or so
of other monthly and weekly “we’s,” to publish
behind the shield of his chief “ we ” —the Daily
Mail— some attempt at justification of the News-
paper Trust. The man of many “ we’s ” argues :
Shallow-brained people with short memories and little
knowledge of the past history of journalism, are amusing
themselves a great deal at the present moment by the
suggestion that it is possible for some one individual to
gain a control of the greater portion of the press of the
United Kingdom.
The suggestion is not at all novel. In 1885 an immense
amount of alarmist gossip was directed at Mr. Andrew
Carnegie, who, with Mr. Samuel Storey, was then
absorbing a good many newspapers, and who did indeed
make quite a respectable little “combine.” Mr. Car-
negie has long ago had quite enough of newspapers, and
Mr. Storey, with all his great ability, is only one of
hundreds of newspaper owners.
As a matter of fact, the consummation of a newspaper
trust is as impossible as undesirable.
The rumors printed elsewhere are as baseless as mis-
chievous. Man;, of them emanate from manufacturers of
printing machinery, desirous of securing orders ; a good
many from writers of the ridiculous “ London Letters ”
which appear in some of the provincial journals, and
others from ambitious journalists, who wish to stir up
competition among newspaper owners. If people would
take the trouble to study the past of their own profession
instead of rehashing antiquated theories about it, much
anxiety and ink would be spared.
In effect: Mr. Harmsworth and his allied capi-
talists have not bought up all the newspapers of
Britain; therefore the talk of a Press Trust is
foolish. That is a very clumsy evasion of the
issue, and if Mr. HarmsworTh, with his many
“we’s,” never argued better than that, the danger
would be lessened to the public of one group of
capitalists controlling a large number of influential
papers, covering a wide area, and pursuing the
same object, whilst masking a common aim by the
pretence of difference of opinion. The fact
remains undenied, and without effort at palliation
of its essential political dishonesty, that Mr.
Hakmsworth controls several newspapers, most
of them professing to have different policies, but
all necessarily united in obedience to his banking
account. True, a complete Press Combine has not
yet materialised. The day has not come when
all the important newspapers are owned by the
one syndicate, and when a united press, at the
whisper of a little group of capitalists can, with-
out fear of check, swing the publio mind to or
from war, outrage, or folly. But a long step
has been taken in that direction.
* * * *
Balzao, writing half a century ago, foresaw the
time when “the newspaper proprietor will be the
tradesman with capital sufficient to buy venal
pens.” That time has come long since. And at
first in spite of its strictly commercial basis the
tradesman newspaper was reasonably honesty The
average man who put his capital into a printing
press had some sympathy with letters, and
put with his capital nis individual pride and
decency. The public-company newspaper de-
stroyed that, and paved the way for the news-
paper as a purely commercial and money-making
institution. Few men who invest in the stock of
a public company consider that they have em-
barked their honor with their allotment fee; the
clergyman will without a qualm take dividends
from a company which draws an income from the
sins of the slums; the man who would blush to
sweat his individual employee cannot see it as his
duty to concern himself as to the wages paid by
the ’bus co. or the coal-mining co. in which he has
invested a few pounds. So the journal owned
and controlled by a joint-stock co. loses the
restraint of individual ownership. It may by
chance, and for a time, be blessed with
directors who take a proper view of their respon-
sibilities, not merely as dividend-seekers, but as
leaders of public opinion. But the chance is a
poor one. A a rule the directors will study only
dividends, the dividends from the paper and the
dividends from their other enterprises which the
paper can assist. The joint-stock newspaper is, in
short, owned by the “tradesman with capital suffi-
cient to buy venal pens,” and without even the
check of having his name up over the door. He
mav sell light-weight news, adulterated news, or
plain lies, may withhold what should go
to the public, and not have to face even the
ignominy of personal association with his misdeeds.
It becomes simply matter of what pays best. And,
irresistibly, the joint-stock newspaper moves to
the next step —the combination of syndicates into
a Press Trust. There is no reason why half-a-dozen
newspaper companies, having but one real object
—the gathering in of money—should not combine
forces to reduce the costs of production, to enhance
the value of their product, and to agree “to
tell the same yarn” when their mutual inte-
rests are affected. Capitalism knows no
civic jealousies. It is cosmopolitan, almost
international. Whatever its city, its religion and
its patriotism is the Dividend. Public opinion
has not, as yet, been “ cornered ” as completely
as kerosene oil, or tobacco, or steel. But such a
corner is only a matter of time. Mr. Harms-
worth’s ten “ we’s ” point irresistibly to that end.
* ft ft *
Australia, in particular, is ripe for such a combi-
nation. At one time the “great daily newspapers ”
kept their individualities fairly distinct. But that
day is past. The Sydney Morning Herald once
despised the Daily Telegraph as a poor upstart.
It is related that when it was proposed by the Tele-
graph that the two morning papers should agree
together to drop an issue on Christmas Day and
Good Friday, the Herald haughtily replied that
it was its custom to manage its own affairs without
outside interference. Now the two papers are so
friendly that they can stand shoulder to shoulder
in begging free postage and rail-carriage subsidies,
and in taking precautions to crush out the possi-
bilities of competition. The Age and the Argus
at one time were as really hostile as they now pre-
tend to be. At present they are quite friendly
enough to manage together a cable syndicate, to
agree as to days of non-publication, and to
decide mutually what days the public is to
have more paper than usual for its money.
All the Australian dailies, big and little. Protec-
tionist and Freetrade, Tory or pseudo-Liberal,
are already in brotherly agreement in the
cable syndicate, pledged by the holy bond of divi-
dends to tell the same story of all happeningsoutside
of Australia, and not to add to it m any way by
extra cables. It is not difficult to imagine, if the
masterly hand of a big capitalist came upon the
scene, Public Opinion, Ltd.—a syndicate con-
trolling all the daily newspapers—becoming a
reality in Australia within a decade. Such a
Trust could save much money by eliminating
expensive competition, and it could make much
money since its control of public policy would be
so complete that no tobacco trust, steel trust, or
sugar trust could afford to be “bad friends.”
* * * *
“ Public Opinion, Ltd.,” will come, must come.
The logic of events decrees it. Given a demo-
cratic Government which is also largely a State
Socialistic Government, and Public Opinion be-
comes of great monetary value. It can, working
through Parliament, build a railroad, buy up an
unprofitable estate, allow a monopoly, divert
taxation to subsidies and bonuses. Its exploitable
value is hardly calculable. Given, then, daily
newspapers, which—since they are the sole source
of supply of news, which is a necessity of civilisa-
tion—are able to dictate public opinion and which,
because of the expense of their production are in the
hands either of syndicates of capitalists or of joint-
stock companies, and it is a natural development
that the capitalists owning the newspapers will
combine to exploit the rich field which the
moulding of Public Opinion to suit their views
offers. There is great profit in such a combina-
tion and practically no risk, since no poor man or
no possible association of poor men could threaten
competition. By no other means could Capitalism
plunge its hands into the pockets of the people
with such rich promise of profits, as by using the
power of the press to levy toll upon the
vast sums which are raised by Parliaments, or
in raising which legislation can assist. Is
Capitalism going to neglect the opportunity 1 Such
neglect would be foreign to its whole nature.
* * ft *
There has been, of late years, a conspicuous
example of the power of Capitalism, through its
control of the press to mould public opinion. The
S’African plutocracy, owning the diamond and
gold mines, was eager to destroy the Boer repub-
lics, which stood in the way of its obtaining cheap
labor and full political control of the exploited
territory. At first open violence was tried, though
even then a secondary thought was given to the
press, and the evidence before the Raid Commis-
sion permitted a glimpse of the methods employed
by Rhodes and his fellow-conspirators to influence
the Times and other papers. The Raid having
failed, the Rand plutocracy relied on the press
to effect a surer way. Gaining control of every
S’African paper, except one or two Boer organs of
small circulation, the plutocracy opened a cam-
paign of vilification against the Boers. Public
opinion in S’Africa declared unanimously through
half a score of “we’s” (just Mr. Harmsworth’s
number) that the Boer must be put down —the
tyrannous, dirty, cruel, and savage Boer. Further,
public opinion stated, with equal emphasis, that
the task would be an easy one, that England could
do the job with a “little war” —a battalion or
two, a picnic, with an occasional skirmish as an
appetiser, and then—Victory and Pretoria.
England listened (heard too, public opinion—
prompted by the same gang of rogues—in her own
country) and embarked on the war. The unhappy
event still bleeds freshly in the public mind. The
Boer nation almost exterminated, 20,000 British
lives lost, £220,000,000 in treasure wasted—to give
a greedy plutocracy, mostly of foreign origin,
cheap workers and freedom from Boer labor legis-
lation. It was the crime not so much of the
British nation as of the press combination which
deceived the British nation. Such crimes may be
at any time prompted, and may be committed
again and again. If half-a-dozen London news-
paper capitalists came to an agreement to-morrow
they could, probably, within a year, bring Eng-
land to war with France or Germany or Russia, if
such served their interests. If the Australian daily
newspapers found it worth their while to do so,
they could probably destroy the White Australia
policy within a couple of years. There is hardly
a limit to the power of a syndicate controlling
many newspapers and urging the same thing
with voices apparently conflicting, but secretly in
agreement. A democracy exposed to such a com-
bination is as an army ambushed on all sides by
masked batteries. Public Opinion, Ltd., could do
practically anything it found it profitable to do.
* • * *
The evil is more apparent than the remedy.
But when it is generally recognised how imminent
and how great is the danger, some remedy will be
sought, however desperate. Democracy having
achieved so much in council hall and on battle-
field, will not allow itself to be quietly
strangled in its adult age. Perhaps relief will be
sought in the Socialisation of the news industry.
The newspaper is a necessity in so far as it sup-
plies news, a luxury only in so far as it supplies
comments and opinions. Civilised man must
have news supplied to him, and that news can only
be gathered by a vastly expensive and complicated
organisation. Opinions he can make for himself.
If the State took upon itself the task of supplying
news—as it now does to a small extent in every
civilised country, and as it used to do to a very
large extent in previous epochs—the problem of
the press would be solved, and the danger to
free Government be averted. The “liberty of the
press” would not need to be interfered with.
Men and associations of men could still print
what they liked, and the citizen wishing to buy
ready-made opinion could still patronise his
Daily Jove or his Evening Satyr. But he
would have available to him, in a pure, unadul-
terated form, with no hint of comment or opinion,
the actual news of the day, in the State news-
paper. If then, from deliberate choice, he chose
to be misled, that would be his own affair, and a
misfortune which the State could hardly guard
him against. Such a remedy seems at first
thought too extreme : certaiidy it runs counter
to many traditions and dearly held ideas. But
the dilemma is inescapable. Modern democracy
turns every day more to a conviction that in the
Eublic interest all monopolies must be controlled
y the State. The proprietors of daily news-
papers are quickly moving towards a monopoly.
When that comes the issue will be the destruction
of democracy or the State newspaper.
THE MAN IN LONDON.
Dear Bulletin.— B. R. Wise’s presence in Lon-
don just now ought to make it easy for the
Commonwealth Government to pick a High Com-
missioner for all the Australias when the proper
time comes. True, he is under a ban ; for has he
not committed the unpardonable sin—he has
disobeyed the daily morning press ; and, treating
their riding orders with contempt, has ridden his
own race ? No man was ever a greater pet with
the morning dailies, once upon a time. The
Herald looked upon him as the “rising hope ” of
a perishing fiscal doctrine. The Telegraph,
newly converted, in those days, to the N.S.W.
fiscal orthodoxy, after a futile Protectionist career,
cherished him in its bosom. At that time, while
admitting Wise’s ability, I hated him for having
thrown his brilliant powers into the scale of a
policy which (I thought) meant an adjournment of
the Australian national ideal for generations. We
were younger then; and some of us condemned
Wise for advocating a fiscal policy which estranged
our native State from the other States, and set up
difficulties in the way of Union—Union, which we
thought was the nearest road to—well, to other
things, which seem as far off now as Federation ap-
peared then. We thought, and said, that Wise could
not be sincere, but was moving along the political
curve of least resistance—a cunning young man,
who saw clearly on which side his political bread
was buttered, who did not care to fight a losing or
an uncertain cause, but chose deliberately to take
a commission with the winning Freetrade-provin-
cial side, knowing that he was advocating an
economic fallacy. We think now that we were
mistaken. We forgot to take into consideration
the Ox ord equation in our estimate of Wise. He
was taken young into a school where the
CoBDEN-ite fallacy was regarded as economic
orthodoxy, and all other theories were treated as
blasphemy, to he condemned with the Oxford
equivalent for bell, book and candle. Protec-
tion was regarded as unarguable, nay wicked;
and the mental attitude of Oxford towards those
rising industrial portents, the U.S.A., and Ger-
many after 1878, was that of tearful prayer. Wise
was the victim of his intellectual environment.
We suspected him, too, of inconstancy to many
causes. We thought him emotional. He was a
dabbler (let us look at the worst side of him !) —
he was a dilettante. He flirted with single-tax ;
he had emotional moments towards Socialism;
but he always drew back in time. He once said
publicly that he didn’t know an oil painting from
a water-color, and a week later he became a trus-
tee of the National Gallery. He took the
Attorney-Generalship from Parkes, and as sud-
denly abandoned it. He wrote a book of Herbert
SpENCER-ian quasi-economics—full of sentimental
sophistry. In short, until we came to close grips
on the Commonwealth question, Wise was one of
the ablest and easily the most unsatisfactory of
native-born Australians.
» * * *
His regeneration may be dated from 1895. A
year before that he acted as sponsor for the Reid
Government in N.S.W., though he refused to join
it, owing to a chivalrous attachment to the old
warrior, Pakkes, who had been jockeyed out of
leadership and office by Reid, assisted by a Scotch
Governor and the Daily Telegraph. He finessed
when the Parkes-Dibbs agreement to oust Reid
was entered upon ; but later on he defended his
old chief with admirable fidelity. He was just
beginning to atone for a misspent political career ;
and his faithfulness to Parkes, whose star was
just dipping the horizon, and to a lost cause, was a
hopeful symptom that he had not altogether sunk
to the level of roads-and-bridgedom. His reward
was the honor of being conjoined with Barton,
Parkes and Dibbs in exclusion from publio life,
while Lyne, Jessep and Storey (the hatter) flour-
ished over them, and the press rejoiced. The next
act of the drama was the Federal fight. Just as
Wise’s star appeared to have gone out, he re-ap-
peared as the tenth delegate to that series of
conventions which devised the freest system of
Constitutional Government that exists in the
world to-day. In those conventions he stood in
the first flight. He had found himself. His dilet-
tantism was put to flight. A European journa-
list of great experience who was present at the
first convention told me that Barton, Deakin,
Wise, O’Connor, and Reid were equal in debating
calibre to the best in a House of Commons which
then contained Harcourt, Morley, Asquith,
Chamberlain, Balfour, Redmond, Lloyd Jones,
John Burns and Charles Dilke. So far as to
ability. But as to fibre. In those conventions the
cracked veneer of an Oxford education rubbed off;
and Wise the Australian stood revealed. How
much that Oxford veneer cost Wise ! Rhodes,
the arch-imperialist, knew what he was about
when he devised his scheme of scholarships, which
takes the best of provincial youth from the outer
rim of the Empire, stifles its originality, fits it out
with an Oxford accent, an overpowering idea of
Oxford superiority and of the universal outside-
Oxford inferiority, and perverts it with a distaste
for the ways, the thoughts and the aspirations of
its mother province ! In the convulsion of that
great Federal fight Wise threw off the prejudices
of education and youthful environment, became
a primitive Australian patriot, naked and un-
ashamed, and stood by Barton as his right-hand
man against the crusted Provincialism and “cab-
bage-tree hat ” ideas of the mother State. When
he had to make a choice between attachment to his
CoBDEN-ite superstitions and the hope of Aus-
tralian nationality, between the dead theories of
the past and the bright and alluring prospects of
the future, Wise chose the latter. Moreover,
he went Nap. For this the N.S.W. morning
press has never forgiven him. He saw the dangers
of hostile tariffs between friendly States on an
island continent, and he manfully exposed them.
He led the thousands of whole-souled Freetrade
electors who put Australian nationality first and
fiscalism nowhere; who were content to surrender
their chances of external freetrade for the advan-
tages of union, and its corollary, intercolonial
reciprocity. They yielded the right to erect
barriers against the world, in return for the
advantages of tearing down all trade barriers
between the people of one nation. They voted
to transfer custom-houses, and all the petty in-
conveniences thereof, from inland border towns
to seaports, so that through the length and breadth
of a vast continent we should have “ that repose
and peace which,” as Sergeant Buzfuz informs us,
“ a custom house can never afford.”
* * * *
Reid, guilty of unparalleled political vacillation
and poltroonery at this crucial stage of the nation’s
development, whose conduct had even made the
gorge of his own press rise against him—saw only
one way of regaining favor, viz., by raising the fiscal
ghost, which had been laid aside in the interests
of Australian nationality. The press came round
to him, the Freetrade party whip was cracked,
and the large and small dogs ran to heel. Wise
stuck to Barton, when men so reputedly strong
and independent as M ‘Millan and Bruce Smith
failed the Federal leader. Wise might easily
have come in out of the wet with those gentlemen,
who, no doubt, struggled long against the vortex
of the re-united Reid-Daily Telegraph crowd.
They succumbed eventually, and allied them-
selves to Reid against Barton and Wise—
M‘Millan, who had declared and proved that
Reid was the greatest financial charlatan N.S.W.
had ever seen, and had exposed his devious
methods of public finance; and Bruce Smith,
who had, from a high horse, threatened Reid
with exposure for attempting to secure a political
pledge from him as a condition precedent to
appointing him to the Upper House, and who was
beaten by a man whom he regarded as a nonentity,
owing to Reid’s influence, at the Glebe election,
when B. Smith stood as a Bartonite. In this
crisis, while others trimmed, B. R. Wise fought
with all the powers of a convinced mind to make
the Australian Commonwealth a going concern.
It is a going concern, though the same enemies,
who, under various names—“prudent Federalists,”
“Freetraders,” ‘ ‘anti-Victorians,”and what not! —
have tried to hamstring it, and are watching night
and day to give it a foul blow. One of their methods
of dealing a blow at the Commonwealth, and at the
advanced Democracy which it incarnates, is to
slander it before the nations; and, in order to
counteract these slanders, and defend this free,
selfireliant, progressive Commonwealth in the
face of the nations, we need a man who, whatever
his faults, was true to the Union from the start;
who made large sacrifices to advance its welfare
and guard its infant steps; who had a share, and
no small share, in giving it its shape; and who,
on all grounds of ability, brilliancy and compe-
tency with pen and tongue, is one of the most
capable of defending before the world the demo-
cratic ideals of its founders, and of explaining the
aspirations of the greatest democratic movement
(socialist, if you like) that has ever taken practical
and constitutional shape on earth.
* * * *
We want no Reids in London to acquiesce for
party advantages in detrimental stories which he
knows to be untrue ; we want no Forrests, who
frankly do not believe in Democracy. We want
no doubters in London. We want a believer
one who has faith in the Commonwealth; one
who knows that Australians will do right,
not perhaps, according to the ideals of
outsiders, but according to their own ; one
who believes in the destiny of Australia
and follows its star; not one who fears that, in
passing progressive legislation and trying social
experiments in an altruistic spirit, Australia is
committing a solecism, is offending against some
imaginary etiquette, or is running down a steep
place into the sea. We want a man "'ho will
show that we are not all national tuft-hunters,
title-seekers and toadies; who will do for Aus-
tralia what Benjamin Franklin did in Jraris for
the United States in its infancy ; and, in a smaller
sphere, what Reeves is doing for Maoriland,
explaining, expounding, defending, extolling,
praising, and, if you will —proudly boasting. We
want no propitiation of English opinion ;we want
our own view-point put before the nations. 1
know of no one more competent to do this than
B. R. Wise.— Yours, etc.,

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Portrait of a King’s Clothes.
G. Bron writes :—
In the article “ Portrait of a King’s Clothes,” (B. 16/2/05)
we are told the utter barbarism and blatant blare ”of
his subjects (i.e., King, Queen, and clothes) were such
that even Longstaff s art was nearly being degraded bv
„ only missing it by the veriest camel-hair’s-
breadth. Doubt is expressed whether it is possible to
0f f a moclern k >»g—to see anything in
him but a filler of gorgeous clothes. In some subtle
way Longstaff is held in all this failure to have preached
some satire about tyranny, absolutism, divine right etc
it is all most amusing, and if the Bulletin ’were
deepy rel :«' 10 L us Paper (where its political
beliefs are concerned) the whole might be taken as a joke
-this setting to rights of Art by the politician-this
sewing on of uppers by the cutter out of soles. The
possibility of painting a modern (or ancient) king in his
trappings, depends wholly-not on the sitter, but the
man that holds the brush, and if Longstaff (as the article
dolefully indicates) has failed, so much the worse for
Longstaff, not the King. It is Longstaff v. Ned and I
vote for Ned every time. The portraits of the King and
Queen made a harder task,.may-be, than to paint a Lawson
or the “ Lady in Black,” but it was not an
impossible task, as Gilbert, Lawrence, Rubens Vandyck
Holbein and others have abundantly shown That’s
where the nian’s opportunity came in. The suits and
trappings of royalty may increase the difficulties, and
become in the artist’s hands an overwhelming- incubus and
weigh down, crowd out or kill the portrait, but in’ the
the , r . 1 ® ht man they would be eagerly seized upon
to aid the achievement of mastery. “ The throne fauteuil,
with Rs cj'pher and imperial coronet, velvet cush.ons
near-by buffet, crown, orb and sceptre how old .John
Gilbert would have revelled in all these and used their
gorgeousness and splendor in such a way as to help out
toe portrait ” and truly symbolise royalty ! His well-
posed figures are not killed by their rich settings p o se
disposition, composition, coloring, execution, and even
idealising where necessary—these all belong to the artist,
not sitter. That is what the artist is there for—to make
of them a work of Art.
The “true artist” will not execute a tailor’s monu-
ment. To say (as is in this case alleged) that King and
Queen don’t fill the bill personally only raises
another difficulty for the artist—a difficulty he’s
tot to surmount, certainly not use as a reason for turning
toepic tur 3 ln to a “ cartoon cruelly preaching a political
sermon and satire on the monarch.” That’s getting
money under false pretences. You may bet Longstaff
Qian t try for that. He undertook portraits, and
nonestly attempted, and I’m afraid we’ve got to sav he
nhif rwY See at this end < Melb ’) as vet are ‘two
pnotos, that have no great points of difference from the
many Jmgo press illustrations of the Duke of York tour
period. The posing does not seem good enough for the
coloring to make much difference on a closer acquaint-
ance. It is a disappointment, but we still believe in Lo.xg-
mapf. He remains boss artist of Australia and a top
man, and will have sense enough to see that he alone is
responsible, and one of these days may succeed in paint-
lng a king.
No, for there are no kings left to paint ! That
was the whole point of the argument, and the
point which G. Bron evades. A king of to-day
does nothing kingly; he doesn’t even believe in
himself as a, king; and no artist can be got
to a belief in him as a king. How then can
Art, the first essential of which is sincerity
paint a king ? Wnat Rubens, Vandyck and Hol-
f, HN I hid in the past has nothing to do with
the 20th century. They believed in the kings they
Painted and the kings believed in themselves, and,
however unworthy, were—in some sense of real
Power, orof generally accepted superstition—kings.
1 arr P ro ,^ ern of the painter put before a king in
mJo is that he sees a man, with all the man-indi-
viduality bred out of him ; spoilt as a man but not
made a king by his royal training ; not a ruler but
pemg a ruler ; not a priest but putting on pon-
uttcai robes; not a soldier but wearing the
mappings of a general—a sham and a self-con-
scious sham. How can the picture be anything
l but a “fake ”or a satire ? Art must be true
->e Art; it can’t enter into the anachronistic
■pi mmery which robed royalty now represents,
ere is, probably, only one monarch of to-day
whom an artist could paint successfully, and
that is the German Kaiser, and the artist would
get 10 years for lese majeste if he exhibited his
picture in Berlin.
The Frills of the Fighting Man.
Lord Roberts, ex-Commander-in-Chief of the
British Army, contributes a sensible article to the
Nineteenth Century on army matters, of which
the vital conclusion is this :
I maintain that it is the bounden duty of the State to
see that every able-bodied man in this country, no matter
to what grade of society he may belong, undergoes some
kind of military training- in his youth, sufficient to enable
him to shoot straight, and carry out simple orders if ever
his services are required for the national defence.
That, of course, is written to apply to England.
But there it is hardly likely to win acceptance.
The logical corollary of universal service in a
democratic country is the abolition of class dis-
tinctions in the army. If in England every voter
were a the system by which the army is
the playground of the wealthy young bloods
would have to fall ; and that system is
an essential of present British social life. The
British soldier is, as to the ranker, a sort of
helot, who must not appear in uniform in respect-
able public-houses, but can use his uniform as a
bait to wheedle nurse-girls into supplying him
with beer-money (there is a fixed tariff paid by
the London servant-girls for being allowed the
honor of walking with a gaudy soldier in
public). The British soldier is, as to the
officer, mainly the gilded youth filling in time
by being in the service, or a snob anxious
to court society from the vantage ground
of a fashionable regiment. That, withal, the
British soldier (and even the British officer) is
pretty good stuff when the firing-line crackles for
the fight, only shows that a good brand of
white men can show good in spite of a deal of
discouragement. It would take something of a
social revolution to sweep away this system and
give to Britain a citizen force enrolled by con-
scription. But in Australia—to which country
Lord Roberts’ conclusion is even more applicable
—no such great change would bo needed. There
is already a leaven of the democratic spirit
in the forces of the Commonwealth, and a universal
service scheme would have to fight no very strong
vested social interests. The only obstacle here
would be the tired disinclination of many to fulfil
their natural citizen-duties and to train to guard the
country which, one day, they will be only able to
hold by stern defence. And that disinclination
calls for no consideration.

State-made Pariahs.
The women of Goulburn (N.S.W.) and other parts
who want more lash for certain offences should
consider the case of Ellis, lately sentenced to
death in M.L. for the Collinson murder. Years
ago, Ellis was convicted of a sexual crime, the
victim being a little girl, and for this he was
sentenced to life imprisonment and two floggings
of 25 lashes each. The floggings were adminis-
tered, and, when 12 years of the gaoling had been
served, the unfortunate social misfit was released,
only to be shadowed by detectives and shunned
by all but the most depraved. His life, even in
the backblocks, was ‘ ‘hell on earth” ; every petty
squabble with a drunken shearer or rouseabout
ended with some taunt about the scars on
his back. Then, for shooting a sheep, Ellis
was ordered off Te Awaiti station, and the
‘hands” were given strict instructions not to
harbor him. Blaming Collin.son for “ peaching ”
on him, this hunted pariah, denied the right to
cut a bit of scrub for his bread, and refused per-
mission set his foot on the 65,000 acres of free*
hold in Te Awaiti station, did nothing very sur-
prising when the circumstances and the obvious
nature of the man are considered—he killed
Collinson. Morally the State has connived
(unwittingly, of course) at the murder for which he
awaits the gallows. Why did it release the man ?
If he deserved release, he also deserved a chance
to make good use of his freedom. What chance
did it afford him when it turned him ad-sift,- his
back scored wi th marks of brutalising punishment,
without a shilling in his pocket, his footsteps
shadowed,” and refused the right to work among
his fellows ?

The Little Australian.
No sort of immigrant that a country can get is,
in. general, likely to be as valuable as its own
child, born within its own bounds, and with no
other country to share his affections. Hence the
enormous importance of satisfactory birth and death
rates. And, since it is practically only the little
Australian who dies in Australia in his infancy,
the infant-mortality rate calls for a very special
watch. Mostly the figures in this connection are ex-
tremely erratic; one year measles are bad, and even
in the best districts the littie Australian dies in
frightful numbers. Thus, in 1902, in tile north-
west suburbs of Sydney, there were 133 infantile
deaths (under one year) to every 1000 births; next
year there were only 100. But still, in spite of
these irregularities, certain averages are constant.
Again and again, attention has thus been drawn
to the awful disproportion of child-deaths in
certain portions of Sydney. Of every 1000 chil-
dren born, 40 more die in the citv than in the
northern suburbs, on the average of the
last 10 years. But while the murder of
the city infant is being gradually re-
duced, partly because the matter has been so
constantly kept under notice, the even greater
disproportion in the infant death-rate in country
districts has had little attention j and we have
been driving our hopeless railways out into the
west, in spite of the fact that on the average one
infant in every six born there dies before it has
reached its 13th month, while often the proportion
exceeds one infant in every five. On the North
Coast, on the South Coast, and on the Alonaro,
Australia loses its most desirable of all immigrants
the young Australian—at the average rate' of
less than 80 per 1000 in infancy ; in the West it
loses him at the rate of 165 per 1000. Considering
how badly Australia needs population, this loss ol
the best population it can possibly get is a matter
of such importance that it ought to be reckoned
an important factor in any scheme of land settle-
ment. We want to settle our people not only
where they can grow wheat, but also where they
can grow Australians.

The Churches and Socialism.
Britishers who inveigh against Socialism on the
grounds that it is antagonistic to Christianity
seem ignorant of the attempt made in England,
about 1860, by Maurice, Kingsley, Ludlow, and
Hughes, with other fervid Anglicans, to found a
Christian Socialist Barty, which would usher in
the millennium by means of voluntary co-operation
for production and distribution. The Australian
Roman Catholic anti-Socialists are apparently
even less aware of the attempts made in Europe
by their Church, to either capture or divide the
Socialist movement. In 1863, Dr. Dollinger,
seeing in the Catholic Clubs of Germany an
organisation ready to .his hand, recommended
these, presumably with the sanction of the Roman
Curia, to adopt a modified scheme of socialism
and to work strenuously for its attainment. His
efforts were seconded by Baron Von Ket-
telek, Bishop of Mayence, whose pamphlet
on Christianity and the Labor Question
togely anticipated the reasoning of the 1891
Encyclical. Ketteler denied that the Catholic
Church has ever maintained that there is an abso-
lute right of property : argued that no such claim
can avail against the pressing needs of the poor,
and that no man is more than a feudal vassal,
holding property under God, on the conditions He
imposes, one of these being that “anyone who
finds himself in extreme need, is justified, when
all other means fail, in satisfying his immediate
wants how and where he may.” It is interesting
to remember that this doctrine was advanced by
Cardinal Manning —a firm believer in State
intervention—some 14 years ago, when protes-
ting against the severe punishment of one who
stole bread to relieve his children’s hunger.
Ketteler proposed that the Roman Church
should guide the movement and provide the
initial capital through the subscriptions of the’
faithful. In 1869, a German conference of Roman
Catholic Bishops lent modified approval to the
scheme, and the Catholic Laborers’ Associa-
tions were formed. They owned a journal, styled
the Christliohe Sooiale Blatter, and their
principles, as laid down in its columns,
singularly resemble those of the Australian
Labor Parties. But they waned as the Social
Democrats waxed, and now have, under the style
of Christian Social, or St. Joseph, Associations,
resumed their status quo ante Dollinger. France
has two schools of Roman Catholic Socialists—
the voluntarists who follow Le Play, and those
who march behind Count Albert de Mun and
believe in State intervention. These are sup-
ported by the Catholic Socialists of Switzerland
and Belgium, and their annual congresses, at-
tended in 1890 by Lord Ashburnham and the
Bishops of Salford and Nottingham (Eng.), are
considerable. German Protestantism has perhaps
gone even further towards Socialism, if not,
indeed, the whole way in theory. Todt pub-
lished his German Socialism and Christian
Society, and had the support of Dr. Stocker,
a Court preacher. Todt adopted all the premises
of modern Socialism and most of its conclusions,
and argued that nothing but the atheism of
Continental Socialism prevented its realisation.
He quoted the New Testament to prove that
Communism harmonised with Christianity, re-
fused to advocate the abolition of private pro-
perty by force, and declared that the triumph
of Socialism must be postponed until
selfishness was swallowed up by love. The
Christian Social German Workingmen’s Party at
first included 700 pastors and owned a paper, the
Staats-Socialist, but the socialism of the cassock
could not prevail against that of the blouse, and
though Stocker, losing his Court pulpit, has
worked hard, the association has lately made little
or no headway against the attacks of the Social-
Democrats. No doubt the Australian Labor
Parties will have to meet from time to time
similar church attempts to conquer or divide them.
«
Yes, a Tozer!
Attorney-General Josiah Symon has taken the
trouble to show up thoroughly (in the Adelaide
Register) Mr. Horace Tozisr’s stinking fish tale
(m the Brisbane Courier) about his wife’s maid,
who came with her from London. Mr. Tozer’s
story was that the girl was only allowed to land
on his making a declaration that she was a tem-
porary visitor, and on his undertaking that she
should not run away and become a permanent
resident of the Commonwealth ; and now she
wants to get married, but “will have to leave
Australia at the end of the stipulated period. ’
Mr. Symon puts it delicately when he says that
Mr. lozer “should have been a writer of comic
opera.” He then affirms officially that: (1) a lady’s
maid does not come within thelmmigrationßestric-
Act; (2) the Brisbane officials took no action
whatever in the matter ; (3) Mr. Tozer, being
entitled, as Agent-General for Queensland, to
issue exemption certificates, gave the girl one for
six momma, thus himself stamping her as an other-
wise prohibited person. “ Upon my word,” says
Mr. Symon finally, “ I do not see why, even now,
in spite of that blundering exemption certificate
the marriage should not come off, and the happy
bride remain in Australia, unless Mr. Tozer, to
live up to his certificate, forbids the banns and
insists on packing her off home.”

Catering for Stupidity.
From Melbourne, in regard to the folly of some
people:—
, r 4, reeen t exhibition of Australian manufactures in
Melbourne led to some newspaper correspondence which
threw further light on the question of how to commend
Australian-made goods to a foolishly ant pathetic public.
I lie local firm of Robert Hurst, boot manufacturer and
ooofc shopkeeper, was accused of displaying' imported
boots as goods of local manufacture. To this charge the
hrin made an interesting reply—“ A few odd boots may
have been branded ‘ Made expressly for Robkrt Hurst
Melbourne,’ but we positively assert that these, as well
Hi the rest of the contents of the case, are of Australian
manufacture. We feel flattered that goods of our manu-
facture should have been mistaken for the best English
and American, seeing that they were ordinary lines taken
“‘oni stock, and were not specially made for show pur-
poses.” It is only an indirect deception that Hurst,
the manufacturer, practises upon some of the customers.
Public prejudice—largely British-born, but partly
repiesented by the Australian snobocracy—in favor of
imported goods compels Hurst to buy some of his
boots abroad and have them branded accordingly ;
also it accounts for the misleading orand on some
locally-made goods “Made expressly for R.H.
Melbourne.” The manufacturing-retailing firm makes
those boots expressly for its own shops, as a
matter of policy. Prejudice must be catered for as
long as it insists upon paying the price of its foolishness.
Every Australian firm in the
re tailing business finds the same difficulty in
forcing the merits of “ colonial ” goods upon the appre-
ciation of an unreasonable class. The manager for
Buckley and Nunn, Melbourne, talks instructively about
the local shirt trade, and how it is affected, to a slowly-
diminishing extent, by an ancient reverence for the
English brand. At the Buckley and Nuxx work-rooms
men’s shirts are made under far better labor'cond.tions
than exist in old-world factories, yet the higher wa»v
paid to the more educated and alert Australian girls
doesn’t prevent the local article from being better
value than the imported at all prices. Linen and
calico imported here pay only a 5 per cent, duty •
the sewing machine is the best in the world ■’
the workmanship is as near perfection as can be’
Nevertheless the demand for foreign-branded shirts is not
dead. Lnteachable persons ask for “ Welch Margetson ”
shirts at the shop counter in spite of the fact that they
could get a superior article for their outlay by encourag-
ing- an Australian manufacture in the work rooms up-
stairs. And so it is with more substantial and costly
things in body apparel than men’s shirts. The manufac-
turer, who is also a shopkeeper, has nothing to gain
financially by proclaiming the truth. He speaks in a
tone of patriotic cynicism. The public pay their money
and take their choice, and when their choice falls upon
the imported as against the local manufactured article it
is usually unwise. That’s all.
Effect and Cause.
Saul Joshua, of Port Melbourne, distiller, has
been giving evidence before the Tariff Commis-
sion. He said that his factory had been closed
down, and £lBB,OOO of capital lost through the
inadequate tariff. He implored the Commission
to examine his books in proof of his statements
that prior to the disastrous tariff above-mentioned
his firm had spent over £lOO a week for labor
direct; had spent £2OOO to £3OOO annually with
Australian bottle-makers; from £15,000 to £20,000
with Australian farmers ; and from £3OOO to £4OOO
annually for Australian coal, besides other sun-
dries. He further pointed out that the Australian
distilling industry could be protected by raising
the.customs duty to 15s. per gallon, and fixing the
excise duty at from 9s. to 135., and by this
the revenue too would be increased by £85,963.
The tariff as at present existing not only ruins the
Australian industry, but damages the Australian
revenue. There are work and wages for Aus-
tralian citizens and coin for the Australian
Treasury in bringing the tariff to a sensible stan-
dard. Why was not that done from the first?
To answer the question it is only necessary to
refer to any Australian daily paper of Nov. 15th,
“1902, or to The Bulletin of Nov. 29th, 1902,
where will be found the report of the proceedings
taken by C. Aloysius Fox against certain Mel-
bourne spirit-importing firms. This man Fox
swore that he was employed as an agent by the
spirit-importers to “lobby” the Federal Parlia-
ment to have the spirit duties so fixed as to crush
the local distilleries. For this he was to receive
50 guineas, and in case of success, a substantial
bonus as well. In all he got £llO, and was not
satisfied, for, as he represented to his employers—
The agitation has been successful beyond our best
hopes, so that distilleries are irretrievably crippled, and
everyone knows it. Surely results so patent, and affecting’
importing interests so favorably from one end of Australia
to another—interests represented by spirit imports of
close on £1,000,000 annually—will be considered as merit-
ing more than a beggarly pittance.
Saul Joshua’s sworn evidence before the Tariff
Commission is the second chapter of the interest-
ing industrial story, which began with 0. Aloysius
Fox’s sworn evidence before the Melbourne
County Court. One is the effect, the other the
cause.
** Talafekau ** writes some mixed treason from
M.L. :
Evidently our British self-complacency is now much as
it was in the beginning, and as, I imagine, it ever shall
be, for so long as the Bull strain shall endure. “The
Australian child is taught blasphemously to apotheosise
the English flag, country and King with his God” (8.,
2/2/’O5). Flashlike, that par. bridged for me more years
than X can stop to count, and I remembered sundry pro-
fane gratulations in the teaching of my own BuLL-pup
days. Here is a bit of one of our little hymns :
1 1 thank the Goodness and the Grace Which on my birth
have smiled ;
And made me in these Christian days a happy English
child.”
An indifferent Almighty might have made me a Russian
or a Prussian, or perhaps an Italian, or of some such
inferior and dubious brand of Christianity; but He
“smiled on my birth,” and made me of the Elect, a
memberof that specially-selected, hall-marked, safe-for-the-
Kingdom band which is composed of Britons, and of Britons
only. Great teaching this for the soaring British brat,
and small wonder that he develops into the swelling Bull
who brags about “My Earth,” or “My mission to
reform the earth,” which amounts to much the same
thing. We had a Catechism also in those Christian child-
days, which, after dwelling on “ the particular mercies ”
attendant on birth in “happy England,” went on to ask
why “ heathen children ” are so much less “ happy ”
than “English children,” the answer being that the
• heathen children “ are neglected and left in ignorance
and vice! ” Fancy the hide-bound insularity of the
Pecksniff who could pen this precious piffle with his
ears closed to the shrieks of the wretched, beaten,
starving child-slaves all around him ; with his eyes shut
on their ignorance, vice, dirt, and shivering ragged-
ness ; with his mind all innocent of any know-
ledge whatever of the lucky savage children who
‘ never know how to starve in the midst of plenty till
we show them the way.” Between the Christian
babe of the black country and the pagan babe of the sun-
lands, there is indeed a great gulf fixed, but I feel that it
is upon the savage side only that real happiness is to be
found—the heathen man wants for nothing till the Rev.
Oily Gammon comes in an eager pursuit of proselytes or
of pelf, with the curse of Ada.m fast upon his footsteps.
Then the contented heathen is “ converted ” into the dis-
contented Christian ; but he has to be chary of exhibiting
a discontent which is “ truculence ” when displayed by
natives blessed with the ministrations of the mission man.
So the converted one soon learns to assume contentment
e y?J\ as hot, and, like the Australian school
children, he is taught to apotheosise the English with
their God. And thus I leave him, singing his “ emanci-
pated ” Doxology :
Praise God who sent the English here ;
Bless them, their Bibles and their Beer;
Work for their gain with restless hands;
Give them our daughters and our lands.
When you glance at him introspectively, what a curious
mixture is J. Bull 1
«
Ex-Minister Capt. Miles, of Tasmania, has been
measuring the Monkey’s head, and finds it more
swollen than ever. He didn’t see any difference
in ns treatment of Englishmen and Australians.
Ihe Monkey has watched the Englishman crawl
to it so much that it is quite satisfied he ought
to go on crawling on his belly. Miles had a
characteristic experience at Tokio, where he had
to buy a silk hat before he was permitted to see a
sixth-rate commissariat officer on business in
business hours. His soft-felt wasn’t sufficiently
respectful to Class VI. Monkey in charge of the
salt fish and rice department. The Englishman
has to keep crawling now even to the rickshaw
coolie. Miles’ testimony:—
Up to some months ago the rickshaw boys in Japan
were very civil and obliging to all white people visiting
their country. Now, if you remonstrate with one of
them he becomes very insulting and offensive, and if you
rnn h? r ? t , ort f a J»P anese policeman is called up, and you
run the r.sk of being taken to gaol for offending a rfck
shaw man, whilst no notice is taken of the insolence of
that individual towards yourself.
Captain Miles went East with the usual Russo-
phobe ideas about the war; he comes back satisfied
that, if the Monkey wins, not only will Japan be
made intolerable for any white man, but that
Australia will have its turn next. But, then he
says, the Monkey won’t win, though the Bear’s
chances don t look rosy j ust now.
The “Carroll case” still awaits redress. The

taken special pains to qualify himself for his work

Hctto- Proficiency, was discharged by General

and it was explained that Carroll was

Before this committee General Hutton made a
long series of allegations as to Carroll, ranging

apouts) that his manner was eccentric. Every one
of the Hutton allegations was disproved except
the inconsequential matrimonial one. It was
shown that the General was not even correct in
Australia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
For her ten thousand had voyaged forth,
Sailed in their ships from the lusty North.
Not with their swords had they fought for her,
But with pick and ploughshare and spade and spur.
Rich were the spoils their tools had won,
Her heritage good to look upon.
Four Seas flowed to her outer gates,
Four Seas girdled her wide estates.
Within the walls where the Four Seas rolled,
Were flocks and forests and mines of gold.
And when she had come to be woman grown,
“ Now,” they said, “you must move alone.
“ Heretofore thou hast not passed this way,
For counsel call on whom you may.”
She called for counsel; a sword blood-red
1 hey brought her. “ Thy lovers send forth, ” they
said.
And she who had thought to be a shield
Sent forth her lovers the sword to wield.
liie edge passed over her brow so fair,
And furrowed it deep with a line of care.
Yet as she mourned for her lovers dead,
She saw that others lacked for bread.
But her counsel answered : “Fair maid; ’tis well.
With ships of commerce thy harbors swell.
Their holds are filled from the farthest lands.”
“ And m y lovers,” she said, “ wring idle hands.”
“Thy lovers,” they counselled, “are fair of face ;
And others are waiting for thy embrace.
“True, thy fathers who won thee thy domains,
Kept pure the blood that fills thy veins.
“ ® ut fathers are dead, and thou art free.
Welcome thy wooers what race they be.
“ This yellow wooer he hath his worth—
Mark how with patience he tills the earth ;
Mark how he maketh the fruits to grow ;
The harvests thy garners shall overflow.”
“.Shall I murk the blood in my children’s veins
For bulging b irns and creaking wains ?
“Shall I mark my brood with the half-breed’s
curse
For the harlot’s price of a heavy purse ?
“Many things,” she said, “are to me unknown ;
l here are others that come to a woman grown.
“And blood as pure as my fathers gave
To me, from me shall my children have. ’

As a riot of color, “The Orchid,” staged
at Her Majesty’s for the first time in Sydney on
Saturday night, is as clamorous as “Florodora”
and “The Darling of the Gods.” The web of
plot that the librettist has woven is not much
tangled, the lyrics and orchestral numbers rise to
the occasion—but, then, the occasion itself does
not once knock the stars. Sometimes the songs
and the comedy sink to basement regions, but
that is just where the audience rocks most
wildly with laughter. Sometimes “ The Orchid ”
sprouts a petal of epigram. “ I thought you
liked my speech in the House. You said it
was like champagne,” says the silly Hon. Guy
Scrymgeour to his noble uncle. “So I did,” was
the reply ; “all froth and very dry.” Comedy
gets the better of the music, and with the fun the
audience was satisfied. There is a lot of child-
nature in a hairy, adiposey audience, and it yells
with laughter when someone shakes a rattle
at it, and tickles it with a straw, and thumps
the other fellow with a bladder. Scene-
Eainters and costumiers and ballet-mistresses
ave been given a free hand in the pro-
duction, and have proved their possession
of master hands (and feet) backed by artistic eyes.
The thin thread of the story winds round the
getting of a rare orchid from Peru, the subsequent
loss of the specimen, and its recapture. There is
an orchid maniac (Mr. Bantock) who is supposed
to burlesque Mr. Chamberlain. The piece opens
in the Countess of Barwick’s Horticultural College.
A comic gardener (Mr. Lauri), a comic lady
who wants to marry him (Miss Clifton), a
pupil at the College (Miss Evelyn Scott), a
teacher (Miss Alexia Bassian), and a huge
cast of other characters i lake up a brilliant
whole. Mr. Lauri, got-up in one phase after
the style of Mark Foy’s picture “The
Golfer,” has a great share in the fun-making.
Miss Alexia Bassian and Mr. Haigh Jackson
have not much singing to do, but they
mostly assist the comedians. Miss Clifton as
Caroline Vokins promised much in her topical
songs, and a minor promise was that “if anything
pinched her waist she’d loosen it with a spanner.”
Miss Evelyn Scott, who has a good acting and
singing part, gave very demurely the song,
“Little Mary,” a ditty that the Britishers know
as well as their prayers, so great is its vogue in
London. It is profoundly and rabbitly silly, but
no doubt Sydney will grow to like it when Sydney
gets down to its intellectual level. A new musical
director —Mr. Andrew MacCunn—waved his stick
in the orchestra.

Innovations at the Tivoli for this week are
the Mahers and the Reseda Sextette. The former,
Alice and Mike, are Irish specialty artists, with
new comic duets and four soles that beat as one
in lightning jig time. Mike bears a humorous
resemblance to a young local barrister of repute ;
Alice is a fair, fluffy shred of thistledown, wh®
has probably never seen aught of Ireland but its
map. They got a good reception. The Mignon-
ette Sextette (sounds prettier than “Reseda,”
and means the same) produced an Asiatic
melody, “She’s My Chrysanthemum,” with
catchy, whistlesome bars. If Sydney wants
cold shivers and hot thrills it may have ’em by
seeing “Cleopatra” and her snakes—pythons,
boa constrictors, anacondas, and the two croco-
diles. Eve herself wasn’t so versed in snake-
charming as Cleopatra, but Cleo. has something
to learn about crocs., for one of them nipped her
hand on Monday. “ Little Tich,” a noted come-
dian from London, makes a first appearance this
week.

About the new singers in Australia :
Undoubtedly, for all-round excellence, the Parkina-
Foldesy co. has substantial claims to the patronage of
music lovers. But so far as Miss Elizabeth Parkina, the
American soprano, is concerned, anticipations were
raised just a little too high by the preliminary puffing, in
which she was described as “la petite Melba.” People
were prepared to hear a vocalist of prime magnitude
instead of one who, though highly cultured, has hardly
reached the level of the popular Mdlle. Dolores. They
have been proportionately disappointed, and unneces-
sarily so, for on her own merits she would have scored.
Her voice is a soprano leggiero, petite if you like, but
trained beyond average purity, of extended range, and
utilised with high artistic sense. To couple her name
with Melba’s was too absurd. There is only one Melba,
who stands majestically high on the musical horizon.
Alongside her artists of the Parkina level rank compara-
tively as pigmies. Of this fact those who have heard
Parkina have only become more convinced than ever.
Miss Margaret Thomas, the fair Welsh contralto, cap-
tured Sydney by her clear enunciation and expressive
rendering of simple airs, whether in English, Irish,
Scotch, Italian or German. She rolls her “r’s” rather
and emphasises her German gutturals, but not offen-
sively. Her punctilious particularity in this respect is
rather a good lesson for young Australians. The voice is
light, almost verging on the mezzo-soprano, but is exceed-
ingly well managed.
Some of the silvery quality of Mr. Henry Lloyd is
noticeable in the sweet tenor, Mr. Whitworth Mitton,
who is especially good in declamatory passages. More
uniformity of production would be an improvement, but
time and persevering study ought to accomplish this.
A pleasing feature of Mr. Mitton’s repertory is that he
breaks new ground to which Australians are quite
unaccustomed from tenors. At one concert his
“ Onaway Awake ” (Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast) by
Coleridge Taylor was peculiarly acceptable.
A most accomplished ’cellist is Mr. Arnold Foldesy.
While in such pieces as Svensden’s Romance and Max
Bruch’s “ Kol Nidrei ” he elevates his instrument to a lofty
sphere of eloquence, he shows dazzling brilliancy in high
shift-fingering and deft intrepid bowing while playing
Popper’s “ Spinnerlied ” and Paganini’s transcription of
the popular air from “ Moses in Egypt.” The latter was
written for the G string of the violin and on the ’cello the
performer limits himself to the A string which is specially
lowered one tone for the piece.

W. T. (bed) Stead has been to see a play—
the “ Tempest,” and his reflections fill seven pages
of the Review of Reviews (20/1/’05.) They’re
mostly of the bed-Stead type :
At this moment when I sit watching the result of the
merciless enslavement inflicted upon Caliban for attempt*
ing the virtue of a maid, there are sitting doleful in felon; *
cells throughout the English speaking world men serving
out sentences of imprisonment with hard labor for
offences against the virtue of maids, who but for my
action 19 years ago would have been free from prison
bars. The Criminal Law Amendment Act, which begot
many similar measures in the Colonies and in the United
States, made it an offence punishable with two years’
hard labor, to commit or attempt to commit the offence of
which Caliban was guilty under the plea of the consent of
the victim so long as she had not attained the age of 16. . . .
When Prospero reminds Caliban of his attack upon
Miranda’s honor, the hairy brute replies with an excla-
mation which implies more of a craving for paternity
than the satisfaction of a brute instinct. Poor Caliban !
Ferdinand and Miranda nowadays would have one child,
or perhaps two, leaving the task of perpetuating the race
almost entirely to Caliban. The cultured, the wealthy
and refined shrink from the duty of replenishing the
earth.
Interesting subject for a competition :
find a subject in writing about which Mr. Stead
cannot drag in sex.

A six weeks’ run at this dull season of the

So many people wanted to see Nellie
Stewart’s toes peep out from beneath “Camille’s”
bedgown that, at the last moment, the Musgrove

Adelaide Royal has opened with the
Anderson pantomime, “ Sinbad the Sailor,” and
there has been the customary rush of extra ladies
to the stage door in the hope of becoming a fairy
or a flower for a fortnight. The massive Miss
Ravensberg is principal boy. Bates, Graham, and
Bert Bailey have the fat comic parts. At the
Tivoli the Andrew Hodge co. has finishi a
brief season. A crowd that can play “ ist
Lynne,” then show its agility in pantomime 1 : a
week, and afterwards put on its skirts and < ler
things, and go back to “The Kelly Gang, ’ is
entitled to credit for being at least versatile.
“A Royal Divorce,” refreshed in public
interest by the recent production of “L’Aiglon,”
had an overflowing audience at Her Majesty’s
last Saturday. In the light of existing compari-
son, the doleful tale of Buonaparte’s downfall
calls for approval rather than otherwise. It is
nothing for the author to feel very proud of, but
it might have been something very much worse.
It treats history with utter contempt—but history
deserves no pity on that account. And it has the
excellent effect of cheapening kings and queens.
The alleged greatness of Emperor Julius Knight
is not perceptible, his only triumphant achieve-
ment during the drama being an infant son, who
subsequently coughed himself into an early grave;
Marie Louise’s family pride collapses when she
most needs it; the incidental King of Naples is an
unmajestic person who talks through his nose; and
ex-Empress Josephine has a plebeian habit of pulling
a wry mouth. Royalty wins no reverence anywhere.
It is always coming to grief. As a matter of fact,
all the people in “ A Royal Divorce,” from Napo-
leon down to the deplorable British admiral with
a sham-nose, are sorrowful creatures. Julius
Knight has come back to Melbourne with a reno-
vated voice, and his heavy picture of the discom-
fited Napoleon is perhaps a little more finished
than of yore. Miss Maud Jeffries is a handsome,
low-spirited heroine. Miss Mabel Lane, as Marie
Louise, forms an effective red-haired link between
this drama and “L’Aiglon” (in which she played
the same Marie in the same colored wig), and
Miss Unie Russell relieves the gloom as much as
Eossible by her gay and dainty performance of
tephanie, the light-comedy girl who frivols when
empires are falling. The bulk of the cast has
some weak spots in it.

The 'cello-drama at the Princess’s con-
tinues to have music in its soul and foolishness in
its body ; also the appalling secret Russian police-
man has thus far defeated Van Borinski’s laud-
able intention to kill him, and the wicked
duchess gets no nearer than before to the
accomplishment of her amorous designs. A
change of cast resulted in a slight tonmg-down of
“ The Broken Melody.” The tall comedian who
appeared as a noisy cockney theatrical agent
has given place to Horace Lingard the Horace
Lingard of former Australian days. Horace draws
the character rather mild, and sets one thinking
of what George Lauri may be in the distant
future when George shall have grown elderly.
One of Van Biene’s solos is now dropped into the
first act, and this is an improvement. Van Biene’s
’cello-playing atones for many absurdities in his
drama. But his efforts at original composition
and “ fantasia” arrangement are not so effective
as his attacks upon the big fiddle.

Manager Anderson is offering 5 guineas
reward for the three best letters, written by ladies
only, showing the moral merits of “ A Girl’s Cross
Roads, ’ and lie will doubtless expect long letters
for his money. The drama at the Melb. Royal
seems so hazy in its moral merits that some of
them will be hard matters to explain. In the cases
of bibulous Barbara and naughty Nellie, the
wages of sin is death, which would be a moral
lesson of the finest quality if the drama
made any endeavor to reform their charac-
ters. But it doesn’t. Barbara’s husband allows
her to dally with a decanter when he ought to be
leading her out of temptation, and Nellie’s
rural aged father permits the young spinster to
prowl around in a palpably loose manner rather
than trouble himself to make personal enquiries
concerning her business in the city. One thing
wanting in “A Girl’s Cross Roads ” is a fine, able-
bodied missionary who would talk seriously to
Barbara and Nellie before it was too late, and
bring out their moral merits, if they had any. If
they were hopelessly bad they would possibly ruin
the missionary, and serve as a warning to the
Y.M.C.A.

Walter Sanford and his somewhat Ameri-
can Players are changing their joke weekly at
Melb. Bijou. The present whirlwind, described
as an intense drama of London life, contains more
incident to the square minute than a conflagration
in a cartridge factory, but the programme next
Saturday will be “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” which is
not usually played at a furious rate of interest.
The Sanfordian treatment of de ole niggadrama is
awaited with curiosity, not to say anticipated with
dread.

Melbourne is to get the Parkina-Foldesy
Concert Co. at the Town Hall, on Saturday next,
and five subsequent dates.
Four dramas raged in Melbourne at one time,
And two were nightmares, full of gin and crime ;
The third was musical in name and deed—
A long-haired ’cellist played the tuneful lead.
More rich than these in scenical resource,
The fourth play dealt with battle and divorce.
From show to show the toiling critic crept,
Then shook his head, and wept, and wept, and wept.

This is one of the concerns which, it is alleged, Australia
“ treats like criminals ” ! In four years it has paid divi-
dends amounting to £520,000, getting back in this short
period more than one-third of its whole paid capital.
Besides that, it has written off £267,000, mostly a legacy
of bad debts left over from the time when the country
was run by the crowd which is now saying that Australia
is “going to the dogs.” And, in addition to paying
£520,000 in divs. in four years and clearing up £267,000 of
the mess of the past, it has increased its reserves by
£44,944. Five years ago the Union Bank showed, on the
whole of its assets, a profit of 15s. 6d. per cent. ; now they
earn for the bank £1 2s. 4d. per cent.—which is a pretty
good proof that “stiff” accounts aren’t as common as
they used to be. Ten years ago its own funds (capital
and reserves) earned £3 9s. 6d. per cent. ; five
years ago (1899) £5 11s. 3d. per cent. ; last half-year,
£9 Is. 7d. per cent, per annum. If this is treating the
foreign capitalist like a criminal, the criminal is a mighty
lucky person. Comparing the bank’s position at August
31st last with that of 12 months previously, deposits had
increased from £15,525,725 to £15,699,612, but, partly on
account of the more prosperous times last year, advances
fell from £12,497,141 to £11,968,017. None of the move-
ments were, however, of much consequence.

A new co. was formed as at July Ist; of the old reserves
£75,000 was capitalised, and the balance was apparently
all written off. Steamships, etc., which stood (at cost) in
the old balance-sheet at £169,884 (June 30th) stand now,
with half-year’s additions, at £127,118. New co. evidently
intends to adopt the old co.’s plan with regard to provi-
sion for wear and tear, writing nothing off shipping
assets, but showing the provision on the other side as a
depreciation reserve. The reserves will, therefore, con-
tinue to be to that extent nominal, while the profits
shown will not be net profits. This half-year £3OOO is set
aside for depreciation, which is rather less than 5 percent,
per annum on fixed assets. On the old capital (£75,000)
the net profit (£10,374) is at the rate of £27 13s. per cent,
per annum ; on the total, including the £75,000 capitalised,
£l3 16s.—a very substantial improvement on late records.
Besides its ships, &c., co. has £30,905 in public stocks,
cash, &c., in addition to stores and trade debts, which
amount to £5352 in excess of the total owing to trade
creditors. The new co., which offers its employees some-
thing in the way of profit-sharing, starts off, therefore,
unusually well.

The writing-off this half-year is really a part of the former
writing-off, when the matter doesn’t appear to have been
completed. Even now the total of £4BOO is shown under
“ accumulated profits account,” and might easily be
mistaken for a reserve, as ships and other properties
remain at approximately their old figure, in spite of
admitted depreciation. In addition to this special
writing-off there is a regular charge (recently of £938 per
half-year) for wear and tear; and as this amounts to
about 10 p.c. p.a. on all properties (after the special
writing-off), the assets ought not now to be over-valued.
An all-round 10 p.c. writing-off is more liberal than one
usually meets, anyhow. Moreover, on the whole assets
the disclosed profit was equal to about 8J per cent, last
year, which also seems to show that the assets are sound,
the writings-off sufficient, and the net profits as stated
fully earned. The position shows solid improvement.

The position is hardly as good as usual. The increase in
book debts is not a satisfactory feature. Gross profits on
goods have certainly moved up in the 12 months, but,
against that, expenses (which include directors’ fees,
salaries, bad debts, insurance, &c.) have increased in a
larger proportion ; and interest is increasing rather rapidly.
Considering the co.’s very heavy indebtedness, amounting
to very nearly 255. for every £i of capital, the surplus of
profits over dividends is very small, and it looks even
smaller when the insignificance of the reserves is taken
into account.

Several changes are to be noted in the accounts ; capital
has been increased by £5OOO, goodwill (through the pur-
chase of outside businesses) by £4OOO. This goodwill
item, which now reaches £154,000, being a paper asset,
is disregarded in the foregoing. Some of the movements

Progress in the matter of wiping out the debenture and
mortgage debt is very slow ; profits seem to be pretty
largely going into new properties, plant and stock-in-
trade (these last two items have moved from £79,942 in 1902
to £88,704 in 1904), and in outstanding debts. These
latter, in spite of very large provision for bad debts,
have increased rather heavily the last two years ; and
that isn’t a good feature. Profits from brewings, etc.,
are not now shown apart from rents, so that the interest-
earning value of the increasing volume of real estate
cannot be tested. Management, etc., is costing more ;
but this is to some extent accounted for by heavier
taxation and increased repairs on the larger amount of

The co. carries £500,000 of 4J p.c. debentures ; and that
is where the shareholders’ troubles lie. Shareholders
have, in fact, had a horribly bad time. The foregoing
table shows what capital they have lost ; and there have
been only four years in the co.’s life in which they have
handled a div. For years it looked as if the whole con-
cern must go to the debenture-holders ; but this year
there has been a turn, and a trifle over the debenture-
holders’ bite of £22,500 is earned. It isn’t anything like
enough to distribute ; but it is £11,557 better than the
previous year. This shows how matters have been moving
since the big writing-down (there was another writing-
do wrj in 1901, when £115,453 came off freeholds, etc.) :

Between 1897 and 1902 heavy calls were made, amounting
in all to £214,098, most of which was written off as shown
above. “ Freeholds, &c.” seem to be the immovable quan-
tity ; and, as all receipts are bunched, whether from rents
or brewings, it is impossible to tell how much these assets
are really worth. In almost all other respects an im-
proving position is disclosed. The best new movement of
all is, of course, in profit; but, unfortunately, the figures
shown are less depreciation, and whether more is written
off one year than in another is unknown. But, assuming
the thing is done on some system, the shareholders have
now a little hope to go on with.

This co. sells land on time payment, puts part of the
profit to contingent account to provide for bad debts,
and when it is more or less sure that the bad debts won’t
happen it reduces the account by paying large divs ;
hence the erratic movements of the latter. Recently,
however, the contingent account hasn’t been growing,
notwithstanding that no big divs. have been paid. At
Dee., 1903, it was £4324; at June, 1904, £3930 ; at Dec.,
1904, £3592. Some of the possible bad debts have
thus happened ; evidently the stoppage of the
Owe’-See loan boom has had its effect, and the fictitious
market values of “buildingblocks” have disappeared more
or less. Still, even at the present rate last year showed
a return of just about 7 per cent, on capital (£6842) and
reserves ; that is, provided enough was put to contingent
fund to cover possible losses on current business. Besides
its own funds, co. has £26,767 of the public’s money ; its
assets are freeholds £11,124 and balances due and ad-
vances £30,204. No doubt, with the erratic property
market which is the natural result of periodical loan
drunks and dependence upon industries which are liable
to be knocked out by droughts, the business is risky (a
76* per cent. div. is a pretty good hint of that) ; but the
co.’s own £14,928 is a substantial cover for £41,328 worth
(book value) of properties, balances, &c.

The amounts shown above as lately written off have
been turned into a plant renewal account; but apparently
the plant, which needs renewing, has depreciated more
than £6500, so the amount may be regarded as gone.
This unfortunate co. has just had to arrange for £25,000
of debentures for four years at 6 per cent, in place of some
at 5* per cent, maturing ; and the extra money will take
some earning, besides which yearly repayments have to be
made. The shareholders, anyhow, couldn’t be worse off
than they were, and the new plant may possibly earn
them something some day. There was £15,000 of capital
uncalled ; but the shareholders evidently preferred to
offer somebody else 6 per cent., if the concern could earn
it, rather than take any more risk themselves. Besides
the debentures, the co. owes £13,915, and has liquid assets
(including book debts) amounting to £11,379.

This society is making rapid progress. Advances on mort-
gage have increased from £28,536 to £32,343 in the year.
On the other hand, overdrafts and deposits have gone
back from £7123 to £3946, which is a good sign. The
society is economically managed, has no foreclosures, and
generally, so far, is among the most flourishing in Aus-
tralia. It needs now to keep down its div. and pile up its
reserves.

Revenue has been rather less than in previous years ;
but expenses (provisions especially) were lower, hence
the improvement shown on 1903. The mortgage has
now been got down to £21,200, a reduction of £4550
in the past five years ; and the consequent saving in
interest is equal to over 1 per cent, on the co.’s capital.

The true profits are somewhat less than is shown here.
The reserves consist of formal reserve fund £ll,OOO, con-
tingency account £4013, and undivided profit £998. The
contingency fund has an unexplained accession of £250
in the half-year, and this has therefore to be shown as
profit; but this fund is drawn upon, among other things,
to pay rates, and practically the addition is the half-year’s
contribution to the year ’t rates. Still, it stands in the
balance sheet as a reserve for the presen c, and must
be so regarded till it is paid away. Few changes of
any note have occurred. Deposits are £29,338 against
£28,582 twelve months ago, and are still in the safe pro-
portion of less than half of the society’s own funds. Loans
outstanding amount to £26,013, against £25,805 ; proper-
ties in possession £60,984 against £62,360, which is a move-
ment the right way. Net rents show a slight reduction,
but still give a return of over £5 19s. p.c. p.a., so the pro-
perties are probably very little, if at all, overvalued. There
are, in fact, very few “ cleaner ” building-society balance-
sheets issued.

This society sells land on time-payment, and part of the
profit shown is in respect of transactions not yet com-
pleted ; so that the profit may or may not be fully
realised eventually. The Mortgagors’ Contingent Reserve,
which bears the drain of the sale of properties at a loss,
now stands at £3232; and defaulting mortgages
stand in the books at £10,463, against £16,599 in 1903 and
£19,559 in 1902. Provided the transactions are satis-
factorily completed, this is a very satisfactory reduction
of an always doubtful asset—£9o96 in two years, at a cost
apparently of £1632. The co. owes, in one way and another,
£91,670, rather more than half of which is covered by deben-
tures. Against this, in addition to the comparatively small
amount of foreclosed properties mentioned, the society’s
assets are £13,463 balances on land sales, mortgages, &c. ;
£115,756 in various properties ; £16,737 in fixed deposits,
bank balances, &c. The properties are being sold as fast
as possible ; but, though £20,790 is represented by farming
property, the land-selling business these times is painfully
slow, and meantime the interest-return on the invest-
ment is, as usual, poor. The vacant land that lies waiting
for some one to come along and buy it hasn’t a habit of
yielding much in the way of dividends. It is only when a
boom happens, and the enthusiastic buyer is discovered,
that this kind of speculating society smiles. And the pros-
pect of any rush of enthusiastic buyers isn’t extra brilliant
at present.

Perseverance, Kalgoorlie, is going to pay a div.
of 9d., or £52,500. Some of those who control the show
are well-known on the London market, and it is just as
well for the garden variety of gambler to keep awake
w hen they touch the scrip. Recently it was reported that
a good find had been made at 700 ft., but from inquiries
made, it looks as if this find were largely, if not wholly, a
myth. Below 700 ft. the lode is, so far as tested, valueless,
and the estimated ore reserves will only last nine months.
Still this need not be taken too seriously, as ore reserves
have a habit of bobbing up serenely, if not in values, at
least in tonnage. Ralph Nichols has beaten down all oppo-
sition, and is coming back to take personal oontroL
* * * *
Boulder Main Reef (W.A.) has decided to re-
construct, with an assessment of 25. , equivalent to £26,000.
Co.’s leases are in a good position, but position in mining
counts for little ; and, as the southern portion of the
Great Boulder leases is, apparently, no good, prospects of
main reef don’t look healthy.
■* * * *
Golden Pole (W.A.) reef in all three levels
ranges from 3ft. 6in. to 6ft. in width, and from 2oz. 15dwt.
to 6oz. Bdwt. in value. But winze below 3 level is in ore
6ft. wide, worth only 12dwt., the low grade being blamed
to a calcite intrusion. No. 4 level is to be started shortly,
and, as mine is now market-valued at £300,000, holders are
anxiously waiting to see how reef will pan out, as future
of mine depends on the result. The extra 10 heads are
now working, and March return should show a material
increase, and April div. will be 9d. The 6d. div. hitherto
paid has been cutting things very fine, but there should
now be a margin over and above 9d.

Recent collapse of Mt. Morgans (W.A.) is now
explained. Arbitration Court was about to give its
award, and mine-owners wanted a reduction of 2s. 6d. a
week in Menzies district and ss. on northern fields. A.
E. Morgans says the mill will be doubled to 120-head,
capable of treating 14,000 tons of 7 or Bdwt. ore monthly
at a profit. In fact, all the big mines will get down to
that average before long, and will have to reduce costs
accordingly. A new IOOOh.p. engine is being erected,
so it must have been ordered long before the collapse.

Golden Horseshoe, Kalgoorlie, for the first time,
publishes its return in fine ounces, and gives total costs
but no details. Total treated was 18,000 tons for 14,5200 z.,
worth £58,400, at a cost of £33,900, or 395. Bd. per
ton. On the average of the past few months 2000 tons
were smelted for 82500 z., worth £33,000, aud 16,000 tons
milled for 6,0000 z., worth £25,400. Taking costs of the 2000
tons smelted at the high figure of £6 a ton, or £12,000, the
costs of the 16,000 tons milled works out at £23,900. As
the gross value is only £25,400, the net profit on these
16,000 tons pans out at £l5OO only, or less than 2s. a ton.
Shareholders in co. are sitting on a volcano, and will be
blown sky high some day, When the rich shoot peters out,
as did that in the L.V. Consols, Boulder Perseverance, <fcc.

Hidden Secret, Kalgoorlie, has paid a first div.
of £l2 10s. a share on its 800 shares, equivalent to £lO,OOO.
There are six shareholders, four of whom are Italians, and
their divs. range from £3375 down to £312 10s. Last
parcel for which returns have been received from smelters
panned out 26 tons for 2240 z. gold and 10670 z. silver ;
total to date (that is since October), 202 tons for 25920 z.
gold and 13,9850 z. silver; worth £ll,BOO, or over £5B a
ton. A further 28-ton lot has been despatched, and is ex-
pected to pan out at least £4O a ton. The lode at 200 ft.
is 9ft. wide, and as rich as at 150 ft. Recently the sam*
lode was picked up in an old drive at 100 ft. This drive
ran nearly parallel to and only 4ft. from the lode. It was
put in a year ago, and only just missed bringing the mine
to the front then. The ore, even at 100 ft., is a dense sul-
phide, and gives very poor results by panning. In fact,
a sample tested by panning to be worth 20z., assayed
440 z. gold and 300 oz. silver, and no gold was visible in the
stone. This lode might have been cut through in the
earlj- days, and regarded as worthless.

East Murchison United, Lawler’s (W.A.), one
of Bewick, Moreing and Co.’s mines, has been auctioned
on behalf of the Union Bank, to whom concern was
mortgaged for £20,000 odd. Co. owned a 40-head mill, half
of which has been in use since 1896, and half since 1901;
but, as mine is 100 miles from a railway, the whole
concern brought only £19,500. Co. was rather a
flourishing concern in the early days, and paid £60,000 in
divs. between 1897 and 1900. Shareholders were recently
invited to put up more cash, but, for once, Bull buttoned
up his pockets. It is only 18 months since Long Reef,
another of 8.,M. and Co.’s unfortunates, was auctioned off
and shareholders left in the mud.

In the past two years B.H. South has made
£137,271, which has been cut up this way:—Divs.,
£60,000; written off, > £32,110; carried to reserves,
£45,161. Writings-off were unusually heavy—no less than
£20,300 in the first half of last year, £15,000 coming off
the concentrating mill. Latter now stands as an asset
for only £21,148, though it cost more than three times
that and is still serviceable ; but it will be replaced pre-
sently by a new mammoth mill. The big increase of
reserves is to pay for the new plant. Co. had nearly
£70,000 in cash or public securities on Dec. 31st, while its
excess of all liquid assets over liabilities was £81,224,
equal to about Bs. 3d. per share. Net profits for past two
years were at the rate of 33J per cent, per annum on pre-
sent capital(£lsB,7B2). For size of co., the South has the
biggest ore reserves at Broken Hill, and its ore is cheaply
mined and of good concentrating quality. As a zinc pro-
position it wouldn’t show up as well as some of the others,
for its ore only runs about 15 per cent, zinc ; but, spite of
all that’s said about zinc, there is mighty little profit in
that business so far.
• * • •
' Broken Hill shareholders own about 50,000
shares in Junction North, and, disgusted with past con-
trol, want to put a couple of directors on the Board.
Complaint is that the mine hitherto has played seconds
to the market; and the absurdly dilatory way in which
work has been carried on seems to point to something of
the sort. Holders who want to see the mine pay divs.
couldn’t do better than give the Broken Hill movement
their help.
* * « *
B. H. Junction is still doing rather poor work,
turning out less than 1 ton of concentrates to 7 of ore.
The average of the ore (under 11 oz. silver and about 15
p.c. of lead) is not rich enough to stand this, especially
as the recoveries are only about 47 p.c. of the silver and
58 p.c. of the lead, and mining is expensive. Things may
improve as the mill gets further to work, but at present
there can’t be much, if any, profit in the business.

Since Tom Harvey and Herbert J. Daly found
Jubilee, and since Daly’s English crowd refused it, the
Melbourne co. has netted £65,700 in divs., representing
profits on 43,1610 z. won from 93,682 tons milled.
Actual value of output Of gold, £173,978 ; so that
£108,278 has gone for plant, working expenses and
management. Average yield throughout has been
a shade over 9dwt. ; and, now that the reef has
widened at bottom level, stone works out at
BJdwt. Thanks to Alcock (formerly of Glenfine South),
costs are low (15s. 6£d. per ton for mining and milling and
2s. 3d. for cyanide work). Last half-year co. paid a
Christinas bonus, and so raised the proportion of divs. -
disbursed to total expenses to 46 per cent. Mine is well-
handled, and, as the board is not frightened to try wfiat
is below, there is a fair quantity of crushing dirt in sight
below No. 8 level. From that point upwards the bulk* M
the available quartz has been taken out. The Jubilee is
the one mine in the Scarsdale district. , ~V'

Mt. Lyell Blocks (Tas.) half-yearly report tells
a poor tale, but not so bad a one as if the January ran of
the mill had come within the term. Co. started the sbt
months with a cash credit of £1095, and “sundry
debtors” £1074, and ended the half-year with cash re-
duced to £564, and “sundry debtors” £l5O. Not only
that, but at end of half-year it owed “ sundry creditors ”
£1361 as against £971 on June 30, and had built up a nice
little overdraft of £6042. To meet the debts_it had
“ estimated surpluses ” from concentrates, £4973, and
the aforesaid £564 cash. So drift all along the line
had taken place, rendering recent call imperative.
Directors made a great yarn about working account
showing a profit. It does—£79o—but that is only possible
by taking credit for the “ estimated surpluses,” and these
very often are an unknown quantity. Co. got over £7l per
ton for its copper from the Wallaroo Co., with which it
has a six months’ contract. Wallaroo paid a top rate
because it specially wanted such concentrates, and it will
not be surprising if the next contract is less favorable.
Manager Nicholas holds out that the mill is O.K.
Tested on the basis of his sampling, it handled 2‘37 per
cent, stuff, and recovered 55"24 of the metal contents!
Loss is put down mainly to copper glance. If so, a new
vista appears ; for it is one thing to concentrate native
copper, and quite another to save copper-glance. What
is the percentage of glance? If unknown, it ought to be
determined, for the factor involved by its presence may
mean a re-valuation of the whole venture. On the top of
the adverse balance-sheet comes the news of a “creep”
at the mine, so that generally there is a shivery sensation
down the back of the Blocks crowd.
Mining men with concentrating problems to
work out will be interested to know that A. R. Wilfley, of
Denver, patentee of the world renowned Wilfley Concen-
trator, which has proved itself superior to all other types,
has been devoting his attention to the production of a
machine to concentrate extremely fine mineral and shines,
and has brought out and perfected an entirely new table-
using new mechanical principles for the separation of
mineral from its gangue. The new table has been
thoroughly tested and proved before placing it on the
market and has already been adopted by many leading
mines in America and Mexico. It is adaptable to any
kind of fine mineral and will fill a want long felt in muling
problems. It is of large capacity, being designed to take
the entire tailings and washwater from one Wilfley table.
Full particulars of the Wilfley Slime Table can be obtained
from the Austral Otis Engineering Company, Limited, of
South Melbourne, who have been appointed sole manu-
facturers in Australasia.*

The British Australasian (London) July 14,
1904 —“ The strong position of the Colonial Mutual Life

in the report of 1903. The addition to the funds during
the year, was £107,965, bringing the total funds up to
£2,814,795.”*

The new electric light installation of the Mel-
bourne Exhibition Cycle Track, formed a great attraction
of the recent “ Austral ” meeting. The main feature of
the system is the “ Gams ” brilliant arc lamp, forty of
which are distributed round the track, suspended on iron
brackets. The light is absolutely steady, soft and
diffused, doing away entirely with the injurious glare
common with other lamps and overcoming the objection-
able shadows in and under the globe. Special globes are
used which, while diffusing the light, do not cut off an
undue quantity and the effect is _ a light known
scientifically to be the best for all illuminating purposes.
The candle power is more than four times that furnished
by other lamps at the same current consumption. Electric
lighting by the “ Ganz ” arc lamp is cheaper than any
other form of illuminant, both in first cost, in fixing and
in maintenance. The contractors for this installation
were the Austral Otis Engineering Co., Ltd., corner
Hannah and Kavanagh streets, South Melbourne, Sole
Agents for Ganz and Co., Budapest, Hungary, who will
gladly furnish estimates and expert advice upon similai
or any electrical schemes.*

Of the several rook drills used in Australasia,
each is claimed by its maker to be as good, or better,
than its rivals. Despite the varied opinions of various
makers, the fact stands out clear that the bidk of Aus-
tralasia’s mining folk consider the Rand Co.’s Slugger and
Little Giant types the foremost drills selling, for there are
a far greater number in use than of any other known
make. A drill’s excellence is not demonstrated by an
“ alleged record,” neither can its cost be judged by initia)
price. Superior effectiveness in the long run, freedom
from repairs and consequent idleness, cost of mainten-
ance, economy of air-consumption, are all points which
mining managers consider. The opinion of the average
mine manager here as to the best types of drills has been
packed up to a startling extent by the_ report of a special
and independent Johannesburg committee, whose object
was to have exhaustive tests of every rock drill in use op
the Rand. Th* Slugger and Little Giant cpme first
and second respectively, their superiority over other
machines heing extraordinary. Complete details of these
S. African tests will be furnished on application to N.

Economical Gold Mining. — Low grade ores
and high cost in fuel and wages have made it imperative
that managers and engineers should reconstruct upon
more economical lines. Heretofore the boiler plant was
given little consideration, but the introduction of the
Hornsby “upright” water tube boiler having demons-
trated great economy, and with safety under indifferent
conditions of feed water, it is now superseding other types.
In W.A. these boilers are worked with an economy not
heretofore known on those fields, and in Queensland over
2500 h.p. is on order for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining
Co. It is cleaned in one fourth the time of other boilers
and has no tube troubles. Boilers may be seen in opera-
tion in Sydney and Melbourne. R. Hornsby and Sons,

The Babcock Boiler seems to be favored by
mining engineers, over 50 mines in Australia using these
boilers. Mount Morgan has 20, Waihi Gold Mining Co,
24, Mount Lyell 12, Tasmanian Gold Mining Company 7,
and at Broken Hill there are 30 distributed amongst the
mines, water works, and electric supply, while in
Western Australia they are looked upon as a necessity,
there being now 68 in the principal mines and Kalgoorlie
Water Supply. It will be noted that coal is expensive at
Broken Hill, and wood fuel is expensive at W.A. These
figures speak for themselves. Evidently _ the ease of
transportation, the economy in fuel and maintenance and
the adaptability to any class of fuel, that are such con-
spicuous points in the Babcock Boiler, are much
appreciated in Australian mines.*

“ Take the tide at the flood ” is good advice in
mining, and the promoters of the Gladstone Tin Develop-
ment Co. are popping off a side-show at the Dorset Flats,
near the Pioneer tin mine (Tas.), while the public is on
the feed. They ask for and have been given—lucky
people—a half-interest for £7500, to be used in placing a
dredge on the lease. The rally is entirely a Long Tunnel-
Gladstone rush, with Ward, the broker, working up the Ade-
laide connection. The name that charms isL. W. Grayson’s ;
Doubters want to know whether cheek bores have been put
down, what reliance can be put on bores as an index of
the worth of the ground, and what surety is there that
the tin can be saved in the short length of a dredge ?

Gov.-Genera! Nortlicote appears to have
been appointed a lay bishop of the Church of
Jtngland in Victoria. During his recent stay at
Colae the musical items of the service at St. John’s
Church were selected by the vice-regal worshipper,
and_ on the Sunday previous to his departure the
choir sang the National Anthem “as a valedic-
tory act of respect.” But why not commission a
localhymnster to compose a 0.-G. Anthem, some-
what as follows:
An old, old trick is being played on Mel-
bourne folk. _ A man offers for sixpence, with a
airt-insinuating leer, a sealed' envelope—“ Real
good cards in it, mister.” The unwholesome-
minded buy, sneak away to. gloat in secret, and
hnd—Scripture texts. Clergymen, who purchase
with a view to being severely shocked' into a good
subject for the Sunday sermon, are specially
annoyed at the deception..
WHAT IT MAY COME TO.
A band of burglars who broke into a Melbourne warehouse played
cards and smoked many cigars on the premises. They also arranged
a quantity of Persian cushions from the stock, and had evidently slept
upon them.
THE LAW: “ Hello! Hello! What’s the matter?”
THE CITIZEN : “ Confound it, man, don’t snore so loud;
you may waken the burglars.”
“ Revert ” : Re doctor’s advice (8., 9/2/’O5)
to give up whisky in order to flourish as husband
and father. I never yet knew a hard 'drinker who
seemed to care two straws for the society of the
weaker” sex as long as he couldget his drink ; and
only about three straws when he couldn’t. Some
doctors, too, counsel abstinence from tobacco. Sig-
nificant, in this connection, the large families of
most poorly-paid parsons—especially of the type
that you would never suspect of either liquor
or tobacco ! ~

Various fathers are comparing notes in
Melb. Age as to their weekly expenses in connec-
tion with the “free” education system. Chip
man’s yarn :
At one school in Collingwood, when the instructor
arrives, the children who pay are ordered to stand and
welcome him by repeating the words, “ We are your
friends, Mr. ,” whilst the other poor little ones sit
with downcast heads until the fortunate ones are seated,
when they in turn are forced to rise and repeat, “ We are
nobody’s friends.”
Reads like a grim lie ! But it is vouched for as a
fact. What cruelty—dull, humorless cruelty !

An up-country ball committee, which had
been pursued by bush-fires for a week, got
a bad shock at a hop which it had arranged by
way of making friends with 1905. The weather
was frizzling, so it settled that the supper was to be
light above all things ; also, as most of the dads had
had their grass burnt, and were grumbling about
expenses, it decided to call for tenders. An
unknown person at the next township offered to
do it cheapest, and got the job; and, as he told
the sweet country things that he’d been cooking
and catering all his life, they left everything to
him, and talked of the just-lovely time they were
going to have. At midnight they wandered out,
with the ices already melting on their lips ; and at
the supper-room a man wreathed in matted
whiskers and strange smells met them at the door,
and led them on—to barracouta and something he
said was Irish stew. They found out then that
he’d been rousers’ cook at Jumbuck station, and
had thrown in the barracouta for style.

N.S. W. Marine Board’s inquiry into the
recent foundering, near Bellinger Heads, of the
schooner Violet Doe pel, threw suspicion upon the
seaworthiness of boats of thb fiat-bottomed type.
Many of the boats that trade between Sydney and
the various rivers are “flat-bottoms,” which possess
advantages in navigating the shifting sand bars at
the river entrances. Properly loaded, they sail
well before the wind, but beating against V head
they rise on the waves, and the impact on
striking the water in falling is such that the
starting of a “ leak ” is always among the
possibilities.

“ Mahor ” : Be the contention that white
men could not endure the temperatures in which
the colored firemen of the mail-boats work, this
summer I have taken the tem-
perature in one of the furnace-
rooms of a mine on the Golden
Mile, Kalgoorlie. The hottest
week averaged about 105 degrees*
the hottest day was 110 and the
coolest 98. The heat inside the
furnace-room ranged during the
week from *lO5 to 125* the 105
being taken about 12 o’clock at
night. Close in to the furnaces
when fire-doors were opened and
men were firing, the heat would
go to 130 or 140. The men have
four roasters to fire and look after.
If a raddle breaks they have to
assist to put in a new one, and this
is probably the hottest work of all.
Several of the firemen recently
went for a sea-trip and got leave
to {put in a shift in the stoke-
hole. They assure me that the
work is far easier than firing
roasters. The men on roasters
have to work a longer shift and
have always a dusty and, at times,
a stinking atmosphere to work in.
The best fireman are not total
abstainers but moderate drinkers.
Total labstainers drink too much
water, which soon knocks them
out. Throughout the summer
there lias only been one fireman
knocked hp and he was a total
abstainer. Numbers of marine
firemen have had a trial on the
roasters but few of them ever
stayi they always strike back
for the sea.
The newly-wed dairy fanner

The piling up of the Orizaba (last of ,the
Orient vessels to fly the mail flag) on the Wes-
trail an coast was a consequence of the anxiety of
.the master to fulfil the mail contract
f inding himself in shallow water and miles away
from where he should have been, prudence de~
manned that he should have dropped anchor and 1
uaited for. clearer weather,. 33ut his owners were-
under a heavy penalty if the mail was delayed,
so the skipper chose risk rather than delay.
IT WAS SUCH A NICE DAY, TOO!
“Where every prospect pleases
And only man is vile."
A sympathetic Taranaki (M.L.) paper con-
doles with an old subscriber in a domestic
affliction :
It will be a sad blow to Mr. and Mrs. , for their
bright little daughter used to milk eleven cows night and
morning.
Suggested epitaph :
Our Daisy’s happier far, we know,
For she’s in Heaven ;
But still we sorely feel the blow—
She milked eleven.
But Polly’s chances would be poor
At Heaven’s Gate;
St. Peter fast would hold the door—
Her tally’s eight.
This would combine a business-like warning to
Polly with due sympathy for Daisy.

A vivid flash of warning on the race ques-

Later on, the motley gathering was photographed,

The advisability of choosing one’s summer
girl with discretion was brought home to a Mel-
bourne man who went into the
country Seeking rest and recu-
peration about a month back.
I t-happened that he put up at
the same establishment as the
lady- in charge of the telegraph
office there, and to wear away
th.o time began getting in his
best work with her. She re-
ciprocated warily, with
thoughts of matrimony. He
allowed that he considered
Miss Dot the most appetising
specimen of her sex. She heard
wedding bells in the air. Then
came one day a hasty message up
from Melbourne, addressed to him
as father, and mentioning mother.
Miss Dot took the wire up herself,
and stood with a cold, .malignant
eye fixed-on him as he read it; and
then commenced the oratorio. He
caught the next train for Melbourne,
although he was going lame, and despite
the fact that he had an impediment in his
eyesight caused by a blow from a fruit-plate.
Melbourne coroner Candler lately com-
mitted a man for manslaughter under unusual
circumstances. The victim was the bed-mate of a
stranger in a cheap city lodging-house, and was
found dead in the morning—the mate having gone
out early—with bruises and scratches on his
throat and a fractured skull. Immediate cause of
death, suffocation. Dr. Mollison, who post-
mortemed, gave his opinion :
The two men were sleeping in a narrow bed ; one of
them had an injury to his brain (the fractured skull)
which, after a time, would cause him to become uncon-
scious, and might produce convulsive movements. The .
other man, thinking he was attacked, might struggle .
with him and choke him in that way, unconsciously aryii ■
inadvertently ; and, being drunk at the time, he might.*
not remember anything about it. %

Victoria’s amazing “honorariums” had a
field day, last week. At Footscray, a baby-girl of
seven had stolen a pair of shoes from a shop. The
Bench decided that a good birching” would
meet the case, and looked at the sergeant. The
sergeant’s face was stone. The J’sP. turned to
the kiddy s father. “ I have already given her a
good flogging.” “ You don’t look after her. You
will have to give her a good flogging before the
-bench. “ All right, ” said he; and taking off his
belt, was about to baste seven devils out of the
unfortunate youngster, when it dawned on the
honorariums that a Temple of Justice was hardly
the place for. that sort of thing, and the parent was
asked to adjourn operations till the court was
over, when the street outside would afford more
scope for the young lady’s proper chastisement.
When the pair did get outside, the crowd was so
large and interested as to threaten a riot, and the
performance was adjourned sine die.
Rejoicing’ in our monarch’s love,
We fain would prostrate fall,
And sing our loyal praises of
The Gov’nor-General.
W th heart and voice in sweet accord,
Whilst angels on the wing
Proclaim the goodness of the lord,
Who represents our king.
One Throne there is above the sky,
And one beyond the wave,
The King whose name we magnify
Our earthly king can save.
Then let us call a blessing down
From Him, the King of all,
Upon the lord who serves the Crown
As Gov’nor-General.
Ah 1 men!

Halliwell I knew in our early days,
A writer of stories and dainty lays.
There is joy to me for a whole life long
In the verve and grace of his Morning Song.
And the tales he fashioned of love and strife
Were writ with a pen in the blood of life.
But a sore, sad man was the bard to see,
He was bare and poor as a bard might be.
Right grateful, too, for a roll to munch
With the famished crew at a counter-lunch.
Halliwell I met in the street to-day,
And his ribs were fat and his garments gay.
He had cronies now—an admiring throng’—
And his pockets clanked as he moved along.
“ Old friend," said I, “ have you prospered then
With the product rich of your fruitful pen ? ”
And he grinned awry as he said : “ It’s so ;
I am breeding pigs up at Bendigo ! ”

A quaint, gay little procession, headed by
a sturdy band, was come upon at various spots in
Melbourne city a few days ago. Bent had been
tickled on his soft side for free railway passes, and
other people had assisted, so 150 orphans from
the Ballarat District Orphan Asylum, the boys in
blue sailor suits, and the girls in red dresses and
white pinnies, had been landed in Melbourne, in a
state of wild excitement, for a couple of days’
visit. First of all they marched to the Zoo,
where they spent three wonderful hours in the
smellful abode of the bear and the monkey.
Then they were taken in vans to the Exhibition
building, entertained at lunch by the Mayor and
Mayoress, and afterwards let loose amongst the
finny monsters in the Aquarium until 5 p.m.
Thence the open-eyed, open-mouthed youngsters
were marched through the giddy, bustling streets
to the Town Hall, where a tea was waiting for
them, and afterwards an entertainment whiled
away the hours until 8 o’clock. Time then
to march down to Princes Court, to put
in three wild and woolly hours chuting
the chute, tobogganing, etc., etc., before
they headed for the Federal Coffee Palace, happy
and tired, and glad to be tucked into their little
beds. Next day they filled in the time with visits
to St. Kilda and Kenny’s Baths, the Museum,
and the ships in the river, and other delights. At
6 of that evening a tired but very contented little
company started on the return journey home, with
hazy recollections of the, elephant chuting the
chute, lions and tigers roaming around Collins-
street in cable trams, fishes and whales swim-
ming in the Town Hall, the Exhibition as a
gigantic cake-shop, and a firmly-rooted conviction
that Melbourne was Paradise, and Mr. Bent, who
gave the free railway passes, a bizarre brand of
archangel.

“Artesian” : In view of certain recent
advertisements, let me state that there is no
opening of any kind for young women in Noumea,
other than that afforded by the cafes. Some
unscrupulous registry offices obtain the names of
“patrons” of cafes in Noumea, and send girls
over, who pay their own fares on being assured
that the money will be refunded ; on arrival, the
girls find that no one has advertised. Some well-
known New Caledonians, though, meet young
women at the wharf, and escort them—whither ?

Vie. Justice Hodges recently condemned

The block of land at the corner of Collins
and William streets (Melb.), where the A.M.P. is
building its new offices, measures 80ft. by 93ft.,
and is worth to-day from £20,000 to £25,000. It
occupies just one-third of the half-acre bought by
John Batman, in ’37, for £65. Batman put up a
two-story brick building, part of which he let to
auctioneer Williams. In this auction-room La-
trobe was proclaimed Superintendent of Port
Phillip, William Webb, Commissioner of Customs
and father of T. Prout Webb, reading the pro-
clamation. Upstairs, Rev. J. C. Grylls, first
Anglican clergyman in Melbourne, fixed himself.

The Maori tohungas, who curse a man
for fun and cure him for a fee, continue to make
trouble in the North Island. At Kuiti (Auckland
district) there was an exciting time one day in
January, owing to a young woman believing she
was under a tohunga’s malison. Having got “into
holts” with the prophet, she clawed off sections
of his face before she went mad, whereupon three
of her relatives became similarly afflicted. At
the end of the scene practically the whole of the
pah was rushing round, howling incantations,
attacking alleged friends and imaginary foes,
yelling, singing, and praying by turns. At latest
the tohunga was making fast time for the heights
of Tongariro mountain, where- the climate hasn’t
so much scratch in it.

In the days when Melbourne was only an
unnamed village, a primitive arbitration tribunal
delivered a judgment which will,' perhaps, de-
finitely set at rest a vexed question. It is dated
May 2nd, 1830, and reads :
We award, in the disputes between Mr. Henry Batman
and Mr. John Fascoe Fawkner—on the first claim, thirty
shillings ; on the second, nothing, although a strong pre-
sumption is in our minds that some hasty expressions of
Mr. Batman’s may have led Bullet to destroy the rabbits.
On the third claim, damages five shillings, and a fine of
twenty shillings, in consideration of it being an act of
unauthorised aggression ; and on the fourth claim,
nothing, as it does not appear that Mr. Batman set the
dogs on the calf. —Signed, A. Thomson, John Aitkbn,
James Simpson.
It would thus appear to be Fawkner who was
really responsible for introducing bunny to Vic-
toria. Had those arbitrators possessed the gift of
prescience, they would have hailed Bullet (one of
Batman’s Sydney blacks) as a public benefactor,
and allowed him a few shillings to spend in Eawk-
ner’s unlicensed grog-shop.
London Daily Mail gives the London
poor a few hints as to how to get along “during
the present distress.” Skim-milk, it points out,
is almost as nourishing as milk with the cream in
it, and very much cheaper. Dried peas, lentils,
and haricot beans are also good foods, and can be
got cheaply from the corn merchants; also whole-
meal from the same source (crushed maize or oats)
is a food fit for the Freetrade working-man, and
can be bought at donkey-forage rates. For vege-
tables there are recommended the outside leaves of
lettuces, tops of turnips, leaves of carrots, and so
on, “ which can be obtained for nothing from the
kitchens of the rich.” Thus the working man can
live in London on skim-milk, cow-peas, and horse-
meal, flavored with the refuse pig-greens from the
houses of the rich (the rich probably would be
thoughtful enough to leave the grubs with the
cabbage stalks and lettuce refuse) —grubs are very
nourishing. But will the English working-man
consent to so live, or rather will he not, one day,
hang his landlords and rob his palaces, as the
Frenchman did a century or so ago?

“Genung”: Was at Melb. panto., the
other night. In one topical song, “ When Cap-
tain Cook first landed in Australia,” reference
was made to the Chows on the Rand. The lines,
We’ll make laws more stringent
- To send no more contingent,
broke the house up. Stalls and “ gods ” cheered.
Not a dissent. I shut my eyes and re-saw an inci-
dent of four years back. My hat was bashed, and
I was dragged towards a water-trough, alongside
this very theatre, because I didn’t cheer a passing
contingent, but quietly said, “ It’s a pity to lose
such a fine crowd of men.” The crowd has been
in the water-trough since.
The interfering small boy and the average
woman’s inability to load a two-wheeled convey-
ance on a proper balance were responsible for a
humorous incident at a busy Melbourne street-
crossing the other day. The conveyance, a light
cart drawn by a small pony, con
tained the driver and her small
son, in front, and two sub-
stantial lady friends behind.
As it came along Collins-
street, the tilt of the shafts
and the pressure of the
bellv-band showed that
the pony had but very
little control over the
trend of circumstances.
As the machine entered
on the slope up the hill
the pony’s grip of things
lessened even more, and
it was just there that a
perky, and beefy, small
boy sprang on to the
tail-board in a spirit of
joyous effervescence,
crying “whip behind.”
He immediately sat
down on the ground,
while two large ladies,
of great tonnage, flopped
on top of him, and a
diminutive youth turned
head over heels over the
lot. The pony also rose
heavenward for a space,
then sank down across
the shafts. The little
woman who was driving
stuck to the reins while
the cart gradually settled
down. The large ladies were
escorted into a shop to be dusted ; the trap
was set straight again, the balance of weight
adjusted properly, and a disgusted pony
tackled the hill once more. Then a small boy,
who had been feeling his ribs and the rest of his
anatomy to see how much was still sound, crept
solemnly away. He had had enough “whip
behind.”
Some of the subjects which ‘it is proposed
to add to Victoria’s State educational curri-
culum—already 20 subjects : Evils qf tobacco-
smoking ; astronomy; soils and their improvement;
book-keeping ; horticulture ; Bible history ; me-
chanical training in wood and iron ; moral lessons;
agriculture ; elocution ; dress-cutting. Teachers
now have to be artists with brush and pencil,
musicians, lightning-calculators, naturalists, gram-
marians, drill-sergeants ; and, top of all this, keep
to good hours and short drinks.
“Hexham”: SydneyD.T.
says the flood of books on the
Slav-Jap war further illus-
trates how the brain-tax on
modern civilisation is growing.
But does the average reader of
such literature —novels, maga-
zines and newspapers—really
“tax” his brains at all? The
reasoning faculty is more exer-
cised in a game of billiards
or draughts, and much more in
chess or whist, than in devour-
ing lewt. of war-news or cur-
rent fiction. Except with one
reader in a thousand, the stra-
tegy of Marshal This or G eneral
That no more appeals to reason
than the passing of a circus
procession. School-systems (in
English-speaking countries, at
any rate) almost entirely en-
courage memory at the expense
of reasoning powers, except for
mathematics. Children are not
taught to distinguish between
fact and inference. Hence
quacks and impostors, press and
otherwise, flourish. “I was
sick, and took So-and-so’s pills
and recovered; therefore the
medicine cured me.” A spar-
row has this much logic, so has
a cow. Instead of the brain-
tax growing, it is rather les-
sening, chiefly through present
methods of education and news-
paper reading.

Ex - Governor Ranf urly
bequeathed to M.L. a loyal
white elephant. The Veterans’
Home in Auckland, opened
nine months ago with much
pomp and male millinery, was
quite a fashionable object of
patronage while Ranfurly was
in the neighborhood ; but with
his departure came the slump,
and as the institution will cost
£lOOO a year to keep going,
and as there is no provision for its maintenance,
the burden will probably fall upon the general
Government.

The affairs of one family at a N.S.W.
coastal town. A timber-splitter met a girl of 17,
and there was soon necessity for a hasty marriage.
Some bitterness was caused at the wedding owing
to groom’s mother accusing him of stealing the
blankets off her bed for his new household. After
a honeymoon of two days at a boarding house
the couple returned to live with the bride’s people.
In the course of a few months the axeman fell
violently in love with his mother-in-law. Finally
the wood-cutter and his newly discovered affinity
fled to Sydney. A fortnight after they quarrelled
fiercely, and the lady returned to the farm, was
“forgiven,’’ and ate of the fatted goose. Then
the axeman drifted back from Sydney and took
his own little wife to his mother’s. The next ship-
load cf Australian missionaries for China might
call in on that district en route.
A cheerful thing iu the way of pamphlets
is being scattered by the “ Flutterers ” —the sect
that broke out at Bendigo a while ago, and has so
much faith in the grocer that he won’t let them
starve, that they scorn to work for a living. The
sect isn't numerous, so far, but it is too numerous
for Bendigo to keep going on its own, wherefore
contingents are wandering around Victoria ; and
when the grocer gives them something to go on
with they pray for him at the counter, and then
hand him a leaflet telling him that it’s GGI to 1
that he’ll be damned. Besides this habit of doing
nothing and promising free and general damnation,
the “Flutterers”’ religion seems to consist mostly
of the belief that the world is flat; they aim two
dozen texts at the man who won’t believe that,
and promise him something extra-special in the
way of Tophet.

So-called surprise inspections by the new
Inspector-General of Military Forces, on ordinary
parades, are now adopted to test the efficiency of
the various corps. The idea is good, but its object
is defeated, as Commanding Officers receive
private notice of the dates of these inspect : ons,
and preparations can be made, as in the days of
the late G.0.C., to have everything ship-shape.

He stood upon his balcony and glowed
With large, contented ox-eyes on the street;
The passing crowds, beholding him, bestowed
Salutes official and good wishes meet.
His broad, fat hand he waved when someone passed
Whose rank detached him from the common fold
Or who by luck or labor had amassed
An extra walletful of yellow gold.
But though he waved a hand or bowed his head
When rank and wealth passed on beneath his gaze
Ilis rosy smiles he genially shed
Upon the humblest in the busy maze.
And then he entered in and sat him down
Among his family, and sighing said,
“ It must be so, that he who wears the crown
Shall feel the weight of it upon his head.
“ I owe it to my people, high and low,
That I shall let them feast their eyes on me ,
The ruler and the ruled thus nearer grow
Till all become one civic family.

The wearied limbs and head distressed with pain
I’ve giv’n my people food for happy thought,
And that is first and last and greatest gain ! ”

“Ern ” writes, and The Bulletin prints
for what it is worth :—
On Monday next, March 6th, an annular eclipse of the
sun takes place. Speaking astrologically, and before the
event, the position of this solar eclipse in the second
decanate of Pisces signifies, according to the old astrolo-
gers, “ death of famous and excellent men (have we
any?), destruction of fish, and earthquakes.” Applying
this, I would infer that Australia is not likely
to suffer from drought for the next two or
three years; rather from an excess of rain, causing
floods, etc., and possibly irruption of the sea on
the south and west coasts. Earthquakes are probable in
or near Melbourne, especially about the 6th and ‘21st inst.,
also April 20th, and a strange suit in the Divorce Court.
Adelaide is likely to have a panic in one of its public
buildings, and the position of the sun and moon in
conjunction, on March 6, at the time of new moon,
presages immense and continuous commercial prosperity
to the Commonwealth citizens.
These predictions are close enough to hand to
make it amusing, if not profitable, to check them
by actual happenings.

“THE VARNISHED BOARD
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
_ _ Sydney, February 28, 1905.
My Dear Arini.
A startling marriage is that of Mr. Ebenezer
Vickery, a very rich Sydney citizen, who owns,
amongst other properties, Vickery’s chambers in
Pitt-street. His private house is out Waverley
way. Mr. Vickery’s first wife died a year or so
ago. I don’t know how old he is ; but this week
at a Sydney Methodist meeting, which he
“chaired,” he owned up to having taken an
interest in missions for 70 years. His eldest son
is past 50 ; and he has a son-in-law who is one of
the greybeards of the Methodist conference. The
new wife, who was his typewriter, is in the neigh-
borhood of 21.
Miss Enid Whiting, the lily maid of “ Astolat ”
(her parental home is “ Astolat, ” and she fits the
quotation nearly as well as if she had been named
Elaine), was married last week to a Melbourne
merchant named Waters, who fills in his spare
time at soldiering. They started off on their
honeymoon in a motor car.
What a superb dress-show is “The Orchid,”
that bloomed in Sydney for the first time on
Saturday night ! The orchid effect of making the
girls look like masses of human exotics has
been ingeniously carried out. Principals, ballets,
and choruses again and yet again recall varieties
of the cypripedium, cattleya, and other bizarre
blooms too difficult to spell. Mauve, purple and
white; pale green, mauve and brown, flushed
purples, pure whites with orange veinings, crim-
son, yellow and white, ochre and rose. When you
want a new evening, or race, frock or fancy dress,
consider the orchids. Miss Alexia Bassian, in a
non-orchidian gown, scores with a pale amber
overdress, with mandarin-yellow pipings and tiny
mandarins growing on the bodice; white-lace
underskirt, big hat of white and amber. What
funny summings-up of a play you hear on its first
night! “ Bassian’s petticoats are the best—all laced
with pink velvet baby-ribbon, and Laurie wears
wedding-garters and—and—aren’t men a bold
lot? All ears when anything about lingerie is
mentioned. Did you ever notice anything like
the silence of the house while Clare Clifton was
reading out the corset advertisement? Really
you almost hear yourself think ,” was what one
young woman had to say of the piece. When it
was insinuated that women must have aided the
great silence her logic did not fail: “Oh, yes;
but the men were quiet because they expected
something slightly improper.”
Audience at first night of “Orchid” showed
ever so many poodle-haired girls. They are
trying to copy Miss Nellie Stewart’s hair-dressing,
leaving only a little wedge of face as a guarantee
of good sight, an appetite, end a capacity to kiss.
I don it’s a pretty custom. I know men
don’t. They reckon that if a face is worth seeing
it should be shown, and if it is not worth seeing it
should still flaunt itself, as a danger-signal.
Mrs. Bland Holt, in a meteor-flag-of-England
dress, burned a, glowing red spot in the circle.
Mrs. .T. C. Williamson back from Melbourne was
present. Mrs. “Ted” Simpson in the stalls
glittered like a star system with a lot of cut steel
work and what looked like beetles’ wings in her
hair «ud over her shoulders. Mrs. Brasier de
Thuy in a scarlet gown and with a seventeen inch
French waist was another looker on. Some people
must have thought the play to be a flower show,
and so brought their children. Mrs. Philip
Morton had two large infants with her, and there
was another bread-and-honey group in a box.
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Connor represented
Westralia in the gathering. Mr. Connor is one of
a firm of pastoralists and merchants, and member
for Kimberley. Mrs. Connor is a tall brunette ;
she was quietly dressed in pansy-blue and was
wearing a few splendid diamonds.
That high-toned amateur actors’ club “The
Players” is capering, in a dignified way (to
caper m a dignified way is to frivol staidly like an
elderly goat that belongs to a club and has a seat
in the Upper House), over the success of one of its
members—Mr. H. H. Wallace-in recent Gilbert
and Sullivan revivals. Mr. Wallace joined Mr.
J. C. Williamson’s Comic Opera Co. a few months
since and travels with the co. to M.L. Howard
Vernon’s illness gave him a chance as Bunthorne
and be is now studying the part of the Jester in
‘ -lhe Yeomen of the Guard.” “The Players”
club gave its ex-member a swag of silver-backed
brushes, dressing bag and the like before his
departure ; and they ought to prove very handy
for the chorus girls when Mr. Wallace gets to
appreciate the rough-and-ready communism of a
theatrical tour.
Talking of theatricals. That fine-looking girl
with the beautiful red hair, Adela Kerr, who was
fcxr many years with the Bland Holt eo., died on
Friday week of pneumonia, following on some
slight brain trouble. One of the late Miss Kerr’s
sisters recently married Signor de Beaupuis.
Another is a rather noted theatrical dress-
designer in Sydney.
Mr, Thompson, one of the partners in the .pri-
vately-owned Aberdeen line of steamers, and
grandson of the founder of the line, arrives In
Sydney this week by the Miltiades. His wife is
with him, and a Melb. correspondent, comments
warmly upon the lady’s good looks and taste in
gowns. Other steamship notables and new arri-
vals are the Frank Houlders (Mr. and Mrs ) of
m, e H° ulder line. They are at the Australia.
1 he Thompsons camp with their relative, Captain
Charles Taylor, up the North Shore line, where
t. i ere are wild bees’ nests, and where you can be
lost in the bush if you go to. call on your next-door
neighbor after nightfall. It is a great place for
the young folk, the North shore line.
Prince Alfred Hospital is that worrited ! It is
all over the discovery that Professor Anderson-
Stuart’s imported pearl is not as highly-qualified
as some of the nurses on her staff. Until the year
1900 any nurse with a two years certificate was
registered ; since then a three years certificate
has been required for the highest grade. Now
the old rule which admitted to this grade with
two years certificates has been revived. Imagine
the exasperation of those who had toiled up the
Alps by the three years' route ! They are making
great efforts to have the obnoxious revival killed.
The imported head-nurse is most competent and
energetic, only her hall marks are not technically
equal to those of some who work under her. The
Professor went to London for a title and a head-
nurse. He didn’t get the title, and it’s hard lines
that now exception—even technical exception—
should be taken to the nurse.
Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Winchcombe did not leave
for Europe in one of the German mail steamers ;
but in the P. and O. steamer Mongolia.
Say “Hats” to the average woman and she
starts, alert with interest, as does the terrier when
you exclaim “Rats.” Well, all this week the
greater part of long-haired Sydney will be crowd-
ing to see the new season’s millinery. All the
shops and the various Madames are showing sweet
horticultural and avicultural master-pieces made
in London, Paris and Sydney. Picture hats,
Romney, Cavalier, and the like seem to be as stead-
fast in wear as the halo with the angel. The
Breton sailor shape is still in the front windows
and has an awful lot of trimming under
the back of the brim. One, I noticed par-
ticularly, was covered crown and brim, under
and over, with tiny, dark ruby feathers fastened
on scale-wise. There must have been many thou-
sands of them, and a garland of larger feather-
tips encircled the crown. Chiffon-velvet hats,
toques of a kind of furry cloth like beaver, with
silk roses and ripe and unripe currants and grapes,
languish to be loved—and worn. Some of the
new silk and velvet roses and poppies will remind
you of bush fires. Outer petals are of the soft
black of a charred log, then smoky-edged petals
and a fiery heart. One of the beaver-cloth toques
was shaded from baby-gum-red to the sombre
green of the mature leaf.
Regarding a paragraph in last week’s letter, I
am informed that Mrs. Arthur Weigall (Miss M.
Barnes) inherited her money from her father, the
late Mr. Henry Barnes, owner of several stations
in northern N.S.W. and Queensland.
From Paling and Co. comes a brilliant little
ballet, “ Marjorie,” with a capital reproduction of
the portrait by Longstaff on the cover. The
ballet, which is in the key of A minor, is by that
clever composer. May Summerbelle.
Another piece of music—one which raises a
smile—comes from the same firm. “ Siege, Bom-
bardment and Fall of Port Arthur” is its name.
In this fantasia for the piano you get among
other diverting movements “ the adoration of the
Icon,” and “ the Russians saluting their General,”
the. “attack by Japanese torpedo boats and the
laying of submarine mines.” Naturally there is
considerable “Agitato” about the laying of the
mines, and they are laid with the help of a fusillade
of graceful notes. One passage is a “telegram from
the Czar to hold the town at all costs.” Very
staccato. The striking of the Russian and the
raising of the Jap flags. The Jap National
Anthem and final occupation of the fort will
present no difficulties to the student. Everything
is expressed but the Japanese smile. That
mysterious thing waB not attempted by the
composer.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ This southern capital was agog last week over
the almost sensational arrival, at the Grand, of an
English couple—Captain and Mrs. Lewis-Hill—
with a swagger retinue. When the rumor got
abroad that the dame is one of the millionairesses
of the Cold Country, the curious and casual city
diners and frilly gossips rushed the Grand Hotel
for tiffin to look on the lady coming or going to her
daily drive. Of course, the moneyed pair dined in
their own suite of rooms ; even the valet and maids
also executed their fine gastronomic feats without
an audience and with fully as much fuss as their
employers. In fact, the travelling staff live in
luxury, and helped to take up half the accommo-
dation of the Grand with their luggage and mag-
nificence.
“ The history of the Lewis-Hill match is inter-
esting. Mr. Sam Lewis made a mint of bullion
out of the London borrowing sprigs of nobility,
and he died worth some millions. After certain
thousands were doled out to the charities, the
widow (there were no children) came in for the
millions. In due course, when her expensive
weeds were shed, she married a young officer of
a Guards regiment—Captain Hill. ’Tis said she
settled £20,000 a year on her new mate. This
trip is costing thousands. On Monday the mag-
nificent party occupied most of the Loongana, en
route to Tasmania. They motor some there, then
go on to Maoriland.
“Society in the gross and several recruiting
Urdlfits mustered at Saturday’s Caulfield meeting.
L'mgV bottle-shouldered viscounts and a swarm of
aides were packed into the pen of most importance.
Most of these wore striped tweeds and walnut-
shaped boxers. The little G.-G. himself clung to
the tall beaver, but even then he was lost to sight
in an excessive body-guard. Politicians took up
lots of the Northcote time. Mr. William Knox
(just back from a gad) was one of the first to
swing his Advance Australia figure across the
path of his Ex. Toorak johnnies came out simul-
taneously in a new grey bowler—the kind of hat
a man may only balance on his cranium in his
severely sober moments.
“ilt was a Quaker-grey meeting. Miss Maud
Jeffries, Mrs. Ernest Raleigh, and Mrs. J. A.
Wallace all appeared in the color of melan-
choly. Mrs. Fred M‘Evoy—another of the
corps sported a coy specimen of ’tween-season
millinery wi th chin strap and Salvarmy inclina-
tions, in which she resembled recent pictures of
Edna May.
“Next to the visiting Viscounts (Society couldn’t
tell t’other from which), fattest interest accumu-
lated about Captain and Mrs. Lewis-Hill. The
officer has graceful length and the girls liked his
saucy straw decker flaunting the Guards’ colors.
But when they saw him swinging an air-cushion
and settling his millionairess on the stand,
feeling was Ja bit reversed. The lady, who is of
generous size, had a fortune in her raiment—all
fawn sheeny stuff and wonderful lace hangings,
but there was greater wealth in the gems she wore.
Pearls the size of small eggs studded her ears and she
wore a necklet like a grand procession of door-
knobs. As the day wore on and a chill was in the air,
the millionairess was helped into an indigo blue silk
coat with immense plain sleeves. Then on the lawn
seat, her air-cushion was spread and the stripling
spouse showed a grand command over his features,
as he placed it, and presided ceremoniously at the
seating of his lady. Every time the air-cushion
was moved the stand showed profound sympathy.
“A good-looking Father Tim taking his fizz
and oysters candidly the other noon, in a Collins-
street caf4, caused one of the smart-girl contingent
to remark pensively, ‘ Isn’t he nice ? And what
a pity we can’t marry them. I’m sure they’ve got
lots of money.’
“ The decks of the Mongolia, last week, were a
scene of confusion and crush. The Williamson-
Wallaces had the grain and wool department of
Melbourne to say good-bye (the loud pedal was
used all round). The medical fraternity bustled
about Dr. M. IJ. O’Sullivan. There were as many
priests as at an Amy Castles matinee to wave a
hand to the Essendon, East Melbourne and St.
Kilda pastors, who are off for a holiday. The
Argus office was down to offer its paw to chief
L. C. Mackinnon. Toorak had come to say good-
bye to Admiral Lord Charles Scott and his wife.
Young Rupert Ryan, with his lordly relatives,
was wished further victories at Aldershot. Every-
body was going away, except the people who had
come to see them off.
“A touriste compelled to drop her band-box in
the Holy City of Adelaide wails to me as follows :
* Oh, this Adelaide ! Imagine a city of the Com-
monwealth without one attraction on a Saturday
afternoon, and at night worse than nothing. The
people are actually waiting with the money in
their fists to book for Anderson’s pantomime. I
have roamed the town disconsolate day after day.
The shops are sleepy ; the customers drone in and
out; no one is in a hurry or thinks anything worth
a hop, step, or a jump. Out of pure spitq and
annoyance, yesterday I mounted the silly old
tram that seems to be tottering with age, and
smoked. Some women clutched each other and
moved away from me. It was horrible, but I
enjoyed the shock it gave people. Yet I had
heard that Adelaide is so wicked ! The public
takes to the parks and seems to make as little
noise as possible so as not to wake the town. The
upper 300 are never seen driving or shopping.
They are are so many oysters unless the Governor,
or the Chief Justice, or the Mayor entertains;
then they wrench themselves from their shells.
No mind can realise the awful dreariness of this
city.’
“The return of the G.-G. Northcotes to their
St. Kilda road quarters was the signal for the
same tiresome old crawl up the long drive to write
the family’s name in the Book of Fate. The
immobile Tommies doing sentry steps at the big
gates gaze on the procession with tired eyes.
Same old faces, same old crawl, same old scratch.
“ Dr. Balls-Headley has returned from foreign
parts, and his impressive dame is dispensing much
hospitality in his honor. Another interesting
medico back from a continental gad is Dr. Eccles,
who went along some time ago to see his musical
wife and daughters after their long term of piano-
studies in Berlin. The two girls have returned
with their enthusiastic dad, and mama follows
in a, few weeks. Musical people are somewhat
excited about her return. She was once the
admired of all the Conservatorium strugglers.
Two or three years of study abroad for a married
amateur who is something of a beauty puzzles the
commonplace person. An enthusiasm that isn’t
single and frumpish and pince-nez-e d is rather a
rarity.
“ One of the most inveterate theatre-gadders in
Melbourne is Mr. Porter—the Elsternwick sport
who owns Her Majesty’s Theatre and appears to
be keenly sensitive to that prosperous fact. With
fine features, the silvered thatch of an Anglican
Bishop and an Advance Australia drop chest, the
rich property-owner cuts a notable figure. There’s
a growing family of Porters, the eldest of whom,
not long ‘out,’ is a beauty—an uncommon beauty
boasting a radiant pallor, a rich red mouth, and
dark, sultry, meditative eyes.
“ Edward Morey, M.L.C., of Ballarat, is bend-
ing under a load of cares. In fact, most think he
is Bent. Hence the trouble. His ’brella and his
‘ little Mary ’ are identical with Premier Bent’s.
They have the same fat, old, bearded faces and tha
same absent-minded way of reading heavy Reform
leaders in the daily press with their specs, stranded
high on the place where their intellects ought to be.
And good-natured old M.L.O. Morey is the suf-
ferer. The man in the street casts opprobrium at
him as he waddles along. ‘ Garn, Tommy,’ he is
adjured time and again. Even the women mistake
his inoffensive smile for the smug smirk of Thomas.
All these misunderstandings happen in Melbourne.
Mr. Morey is glad to get home now and again to
Ballarat, where he isn’t erroneously upbraided for
looking like the other person.
“A globe-trotter writes this mail of Randolph
Bedford: * The Whirlwind arrived here last week,
and as soon as the fog lifted I saw him in a silk
hat and a flogger. For some days that state of
things lasted, then he became grievously ill. On
recovering he ’verted to the slouch hat and the
travel-worn sac, and was ajoying of himself very
much. Besides mines, he has a novel, an opera
libretto and other wares to dispose of.’
“The drama of the ’cello strum introduces a
novelty—a stage manageress. Miss Lena Burn-
leigh (the wife of Van) is in command of the situa-
tion. She doesn’t look it. She is excessively
feminine in speech, gesture, movement —the sort
of purry charmer who looks more the dreamer
than the doer.
‘“The Christian Israelites,’ writes a Rhine
passenger, ‘ keep us amused. Some of the women
have beards, most of them are married, and all of
them are going to North America. The men with
the hanging hair leave the poor wives there, and
go off to Jerusalem to look for the spot where
Christ was buried. Strangely enough, this
Quixotic tribe have musical tastes, and can’t be
torn from the pianos. They are funny figures on
deck when there’s any kind of a blow or sea on.
Their unkempt, unbound, and uncut hair is all
over the place.’
“There has lately developed in Melbourne a
new type of bore. He is an aggravation of the
tea-room johnnie. But whereas that mighty atom
only bothered himself and the girl who served up
the scone, the new bore inflicts a whole room. He
wants certain tunes played, and hands along a
list of ‘ classical ’ selections for the string-band to
administer. If the band knows the desired airs,
it dispenses them, and all the tea-drinkers who
had been absorbing ‘ Little Mary ’ or ‘ Egypt,’
and ordering more toasted muffin in sheer joyous-
ness, frown upon the autocrat and endeavor to
blast him with a look. But it’s no use. He is
serene in his perverted love for ‘good, sound,
classical music ’ with his cream tart and his tea.
Now, for my part, I like good music in its place,
but I don’t want to eat ice-cream to music by
Beethoven, or sweep the crumbs off my frock to a
Mozart selection. For eating-house purposes
music should be gay and light as a good piece of
puff pastry. The tea-rooms will be losing their
scone-nibblers if the ‘ good-music bore ’ is encour-
aged further.
“ When a certain squatter married his first wife
—a distinguished society beauty—he compelled
the lady to come over to his (R.C.) church for the
union. Later, when, as a widower, he conferred
himself and his dollars on a chorus chick, he was
led like a lamb to the rival rails.
“Retired Judge Casey has issued cards for a
garden party on Thursday next (4th March), at
‘lbricane,’ St. Kilda, the domicile that flies a flag
what time the festive host is entertaining a shoal
of friends beneath his roof. The flag that braves
the bottle and the breeze, so to speak.
“ Early March is to see a course of polo matches
—with a jolly Gymkhana to finish. The woolly
dames from the opulent Western district are
helping the polo carnival by a grand dance at
the Prahran Town Hall. Kooyong is having
a special feast on Friday, the 10th, when the lady
sports, or poloeens, will show their want of skill,
ponies being lent by their reckless admirers.
“ A tennis champion, who used to fascinate
with his looks the Block charmers, is now
promenading the passages of his dad-in-law’s big
farter store in a populous suburb. His smile
eguiles the she-customer to ‘ Walk this way.
please.’ A point this for the drapers. Why not
get always fascinating men and ex-sports (instead
of gouty old bucks) to walk the shop and enchant
the she-shopper ?
“A jaundiced spouse, noting his wife’s atten-
tions to the clean-faced Johnnies of the squadron,
has moved every bristle from his chin and lip to
see if the shaven countenance will have any luck
in winning the fickle one back, or in capturing
something that might arouse her jealousy.
Nothing better than a rival girl to bring the old
girl back to reason !
“ The motor-accident is becoming a gag. The
dame who is taken out for an afternoon whirr by
hubby’s best pal, and only returns at the aft-end
of supper-time, tells a breathless and wholly un-
convincing story of a collision with a bunny on a
rural road, or an impromptu sort of spill at a
critical turning-point. Last week, a great dinner
in the Kew district had to go on without the
hostess. She arrived at the same good old time, in
the honored state of breathlessness, with the
venerable yarn of a broken-down motor.

your own district who have been cured by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills of dizziness, palpitation,
biliousness, sour stomach, sick headaches, and the
internal pains of Indigestion.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cure because they
strike straight at the root of all stomach trouble.
They actually make new pure red blood. And
new blood is just what the stomach needs to set it
right and give it strength for its work. The first
box or two will give you a wonderful appetite.
“Five years ago I was a martyr to a bad
stomach,” said Mr. A. T. Porteus, 6 Napier-street,
Paddington, Sydney. “My illness started with
a thumping, throbbing pain in my head, right
between the eyes. Sometimes it nearly blinded
me. If I took a mouthful of food, a cutting pain
soon caught me at the end of the breast-bone. My
head used to ache by the hour, and every morning
I got up heavy and drowsy, with a horrible brassy
taste in my mouth.
“Of course, I couldn't eat, and I lost weight.
My clothes were like bags on me,” Mr. Porteus
went on to say. “When I stood up after lying
down, a strange feeling would come over me, and
my head would swim with dizziness. Every little
while I had a bilious attack. Just before it came
on, I would grow cold all over, and great heavy
beads of perspiration would stand out on my fore-
head. After it was over, I would shiver and
shake and feel as weak as a kitten.
“I felt so miserable and downhearted that I
didn’t care whether I lived or died. Still I went
on taking all sorts of medicines. I wasted many
a pound this way before I read about other cases
like mine, that were cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. I made up my mind to give them a fair
trial—so I got a good supply. To my delight the
first box gave me a wonderful appetite. From
that on, every dose did me good. My stomach
gradually got back its strength. Soon I was feel-
ing as healthy and strong as any man. Now
my digestion is perfect thanks entirely to
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured Mr. Porteus’
Indigestion because they went down to the root
of ine trouble in his blood. That is why they
never fail. Bad blood is the cause of all common-
diseases like anaemia (bloodlessness), eczema, pale-
ness, headaches, neuralgia, sciatica, rheumatism,
lumbago, general weakness, and the special ail-
ments that only women folk know. Bad blood is-
the one cause—and Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills ar®
the one cure, because they actually make new
blood. They do just one thing—but they do it
don’t bother with mere symptoms.
JLhey don’t cure for a day—they cure for good.
Do not take any pills without the full name.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Lieut. "Wit-ton, of the Bushveldt Carbi-
neers, is now settled at Lancefield (Vic.) as a land
and estate agent.
Said now, in circles that claim to be well-
informed, that Mr. George Reid will succeed Mr.
Justice O’Connor (gone to the Arbitration Court)
on the High Court Bench. Tn that case Mr.
Alfred Deakin may join the Cabinet.
Mrs. Eliza Stead, of Medindie (S.A.), is
over 100 years of age. Born in 1804. she remem-
bers the excitement caused by the Battle of
Waterloo.
Dr. Bevan’s last sermon in Melbourne,
before his departure on a gorgeous holiday-trip to
Europe, was on the subject, “Do I need more
than to be saved?” Well, he takes some more,
anyhow.
“Johnny” Barber, a well-known Sackville
{N.S.W.) aboriginal who died, cetat 80, in Windsor
Hospital last week, married three times, and was
the proud father of 29 full-blood aboriginal olive
branches. He was a genuine “ Hawkesbury
native.”
There is friction already over the new
appointments to the N.S.W. Education Depart-
ment. One of the authors of the recent joint
report on education may resign.
Mr. Walter Edmunds, acting temporarily
as N.S.W. District Court Judge, made a good
start when, in declining to allow the benefit of the
First Offenders Act to a man who had robbed his
trade-union, he commented : “Fora man to rob
his mates is much worse than for him to rob his
employer.”
Letters in the Sydney press complain that
N.S.W. acting Agent-General Coghlan went to
Europe in a German boat. But surely, in 1905,
the Australian has the right to travel by what
vessel he pleases ; a century ago our ancestors
certainly had to take a British Government boat
in coming to Australia—no refusals allowed—but
circumstances have since changed.
Reid’s political future is so dark that any-
thing may happen. The anti-socialist legions he
called on won’t rise, for the socialism they have
been asked to fight doesn’t exist. The capitalistic
party, pure and simple, is prepared to put up a
show of fighting, but Reid is wise enough not to
take the field with them alone. He’s in the
tightest place of his life, and a somersault to a
cushion somewhere is a natural way out.
Mr. Murray, Chief Judicial Officer of New
Guinea, is reported to be in indifferent health.
No wonder. On his first circuit he had to sen-
tence 2G Papuans to be hanged.
WRESTLER HACKENSCHMIDT, OF
RUSSIA.
Just died at Carlton (Vic.), cetat 79, W. H
Manwaring. old-time police detective. First of
London police, later attached to Scotland Yard,
he afterwards served in the Crimea, getting the
Alma medal and clasp. Reached Victoria in the
fifties, joined the detective force in ’57, and there
remained till 1880, when he retired. He was
present at shooting of bushranger Morgan, and
took an active part in chasing Power, Stanford
and other bush free-lances of the time.
Mrs. Willis, formerly an Adelaide Hospi-
tal nurse, recently travelled overland from Oodna-
datta to Port Darwin with her husband. She did
400 miles of the journey on foot, and says she
enjoyed it.
. V certain well-advertised Brisbane parson,
in years gone by, filled in his spare time o’
nights as a public park visitor with a mission.
Armed with a bull’s-eye lantern, he used
to cast a ray on the couples who sat in dark
corners. Even if they did not belong to his con-
gregation he strongly advised them to lose no
time in visiting his study with the necessary wit-
nesses. Whether he so acted for business or for
pleasure, or from high moral motives, was never
exactly determined.
Anglican Primate Smith, who is still sore
over the lederal Senate’s refusal of a petition
signed with his fancy ecclesiastical name, has not
been hit so badly as was Bishop Harmer, of Ade-
mide. Bishop Harmer applied to the Adelaide
negistrar to be licensed to celebrate marriages,
and gave his name as “J. R. Adelaide.” The
egistrar declined, and while the dispute was

Wealthy Adelaide brewer W 11. Beagle-
hole is off to London. He was a stonemason in
the early days, and, after building Kapunda rail-
way station, invested his profits in an hotel, found
the mining folk thirsty, and made a fortune.
Once he rode in a stone-carter’s dray ; now it is a
motor car.
Sydney Trades Hall will put up a marble
bust to Henry Copeland, a generous remembrance
of a staunch democrat of the days when demo-
crats were few. A bust is fitting, for Henry
tailed off in his latter days, and that tail would
not look well in the Trades Hall.
Mr. Charles Todd, who has just retired
from the S. A. post-office, after 50 years’ service,
lias got so much into the habit of turning up to
his Adelaide office at a certain time each morning
that he found himself there on each of several
days after his retirement. He then decided to go
off with his daughter on a trip to Melbourne, to
break himself of the routine.
A young N.S. YV. dentist, who had been
reckoned good enough at the business to act as
demonstrator at Sydney Dental College, some
time back hung out his shingle in a Vic. town just
over the border. After working up a decent prac-
tice, he was flattened out by the Vic. authorities.
He had been two years on the N.S.W. rolls ; but
nothing less than seven years’ N.S.W. registration
would answer. Yet the Vic. tooth-tugger can
screw up his signboard in N.S.W. on a 10-minutes
Vic. registration.
Bigjohn Forrest is having a great time
amongst his Gropers. At a meeting, the other
day, he boasted that during his 10 years’ Premier-
ship he never made a mistake, and there was not
a single administrative action he regretted. Not
one mistake ! Now, didn’t he mistake his friend’s
umbrella prod for the stab of an assassin what time
he invaded the goldfields—and was already scoot-
ing back to civilisation and safety while friend
Maitland Brown was wiring, “My God, I am
proud of you ! ”
In the Melbourne Divorce Court, Kate
Horwitz, wife of Louis Horwitz, has obtained a
divorce on the grounds of his adultery. When
Horwitz was served in gaol with the divorce
papers he took the matter quietly, and just
remarked that they were all in order, and all he
desired was the suppression of the “ lady’s name.”
The late Frank Scarr, who recently died
at Neutral Bay, was in the old days a sturdy ex-
plorer of the Northern Territory. In 1878 he
tried to cross from the Georgina to the Overland
Line on a more southern course than that followed
by Nat. Buchanan. The. season, however, was too
dry, and he had to return to Buchanan’s Creek
and make for Tennant’s Creek that way. While
trying to cross via Pituri Creek he found some of
the horses of the ill-fated Prout Brothers, who
met their deaths in the dry country west of the
Queensland border. Scarr was both a good bush-
man and surveyor, two things which are not
always found in conjunction.
Mrs. Margaret Durack, one of the mothers
of the North Queensland and North Westralian
families of pioneering Duracks, died, last week, at
North Sydney, aged 83. She came of healthy,
hearty, handsome stock, and left behind genera-
tions who are doing their utmost to justify the
Commonwealth policy of “ a white Australia.”
N.S.W. Law Almanac for this year deigns
to notice slightly the existence of the High Court
of Australia—printing the list of solicitors who
are commissioned to take affidavits in its juris-
diction. Otherwise the High Court is ignored.
And the other day Justices Darley and Owen sat
heavily on a barrister who referred to Justice
Griffith as “Chief Justice of Australia.” There
is no such office, said Mr. Darley. Certainly
Mr. Griffith is rightly “ Chief Justice of the High
Court of Australia.” But does Mr. Darley ever
object to the ellipsis which makes him “ Chief
Justice of N.S. Wales” instead of “Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of N.S. Wales ” ?
The man with brains and doubts generally
works life in broken shifts. J. Newton-Wood,
who, with Paris Nesbit, started the Adelaide
weekly, Morning, began as a Wesleyan parson
in the Cold Country. Beginning to question the
belief he was paid to teach, he signed off and
started a local rag. He worked up in journalism
till he became a sub-editor of London Times.
Gave that up to edit the Vegetarian, London
organ of the apples-and-water crowd. An agent
of Chaffey Bros.’ Mildura boom dragged him out
to Australia, where he took up 10 acres of salt-
bush at Mildura. Lost what little he brought
out, and edited the local Irrigationist for a crust.
Got in with a group of visionaries, who wanted to
form a communistic settlement, and was appointed
leader. Founded the Nyah (originally called
Tyntynder) village settlement on the Murray,
from Swan Hill, Vic. Sold out and went to Ade-
laide, and ran the printing office attached to a
missionary training college. Eventually got into
the editorial chair of Adelaide Labor Herald,
but did not stay long. Out of the pieces of
Nesbit’s Morning he raised Century, a fort-
nightly devoted to mental science, spiritualism,
etc. He writes most of and sets and machines an
8-page paper himself, though he is over 70 years.
“ PERSONAL ITEM. ”
Mr. Jonas Plugger, of Wharfside is thoroughly run down, and will be ordered a quiet
month's rest in the country.
Mr. Henry Willis, M.H.R. for Robertson,
is reputed to be the richest man in the Federal
Parliament. Mining and a fortunate marriage
made his wealth.
Attorney-General Homburg’s grab at a
seat on the Supreme Court bench of S. Australia
is something of a scandal. Had he not been an
accidental Attorney-General he would never have
been even mentioned for the place. Mr. JTomburg
was only drafted into the Jenkins Ministry a few
months ago, when Iscariot was called upon by
Darling to make room fora'couple of reactionaries.
Probably he will be painstaking enough in a dull
way ; but, even if he promised to be twice as
brilliant, that would not justify the manner of the
appointment.
The long-tlireatened retirement of Justice
Boucaut, of South Australia, came pretty suddenly
at the end. He was a vigorous man in his day,
and one of the most strenuous Ministers S.A. has
known, though there was a good deal of Bang-and-
Borrow about his locally-famous public-works
policy. These days he would have been known as
Owecaut—or Owe-Cohen. He was a good hater
of shams, and “Society” was a good hater of him,
but when he accepted a knighthood the toadies
came round a bit, though he still moved little their
way. Starting as a confirmed despiser of the
plutocrat, he wound up by being a good deal of a
plutocrat himself—married into an old-time
squatting family, and became Australia’s best-
known breeder of Arab blood-stock. The Judge,
who looked like a bushman, paddling down the
jetty in his bare feet, used to be one of the sights
of Glenelg, where he lived most of his life and was
head of the local hard-grafting yachting crowd.
Maitre Labori, who is acting as counsel
for Carrie Swain in the Gardner matrimonial
cause, summarised the case for his client before
the Paris civil court :
Mr; Gardner in 1866, when he was a theatrical manager,
married'his client; who wag then a singer known as Mrs.
Oarrie Wisler. She had been divorced from her former
husband, whose name was Swain. The record of the
marriage between Gardner and Swain has disappeared.
The pair went on a theatrical tour in Australia, where
Mrs. Gardner earned considerable sums. They invested
in gold mines, and, as the result of these speculations,
realised a large fortune. In 1901 Mr. Gardner fell in love
with a friend of his wife’s, Madame Le Glay, who had
been divorced from her husband. He then left his wife,
alleging that her marriage with him was null and void,
he having been married previously. He omitted to add
that he had been divorced from his former wife, whose
name was Anna Graham. Instead, he sent a copy of the
divorce decree which had terminated his union with
Madame Graham to Mrs. Swain, informing her that it was
really a decree dissolving her own marriag-e with him.
Mr. Gardner subsequently married Madame Le Glay in
London. On learning this Mrs. Swain sued Mr. Gardner
in the Philadelphia court, which had granted the divorce
between him and Madame Graham. She sought leave to
plead the nullity of this divorce, but the American court
rejected her claim. Mrs. Swain then brought the present
action before the Paris court, affirming the validity of her
marriage with Mr. Gardner.
Barren joey’s sneak-out of the Education
Department difficulties in N.S.W., by cutting the
available pudding into six and giving a piece to-
each aspirant, hasn’t been long in bearing the-
expected fruit of friction and discontent,
McOredie, who has been Acting' Under-Secretary,
and before that was Acting Chief Inspector, has
thrown his new slice out of the window, and has
taken 12 months’ leave with a view to quitting”
the service altogether.
Leith Napier, one of the two doctors
whom C. C. Kingston brought out to run the
Adelaide Hospital what time the local sawbones
were on strike, found himself the other day a.
victim of the Boer backwash. Napier took to
mafficking like the rest of them, only in a heavy,
sober way—took to putting on gorgeous uniform,
and capering on strange horses fed on oats.
Going down to Marino, where a contingent was-
being instructed in the ways of farm-burning,
Napier’s strange animal somehow got from under
him. For many months he wasn’t expected to-
live ; and, though he did live, he can never be the
same Napier again. For four years he wasn’t
able to make much move in the matter of a claim
for compensation ; and when he did move, he met
the backwash. The Government drove him to-
the courts, and there the S. Aus. Chief Justice
ruled that he wasn’t actually on service ; and the-
claim for £6500 collapsed.
About Joseph Banks :
Banks is the latest man to claim a statue in Sydney,
Many good things may be said of that culler of simples,
and most of them have been said, but there are other
things. If Banks had had his way there never would have
been a White Australia. The race would have been part
gaol-bird, part Polynesian, part Chinkey. He patterned
the settlement on the Dutch possessions, and was of
opinion that any number of useful inhabitants might be-
drawn from China. He backed Matra’s scheme of bring-
ing women from Otaheite and neighboring islands for the
men at the settlement. Had he adhered to the plan of
colonisation first approved by him, no convict would
have been discharged to Australian shores. That
plan contemplated the transfer to Botany Bay of
those Americans who had been on the losing
side in the war of American independence. Thou-
sands of these found it difficult to settle down-
in America at the close of the war, and were willing to-
found a new settlement in Australia, if the British Govern-
ment would assist. James Maria Matra played Moses to-
these people, and was at first supported by Banks.
But the English Government wanted to reduce the horror
of overcrowding in its gaols, and fixed on Botany Bay as-
an eligible dumping-ground and no sooner did Banks find
the humor of Government than he abandoned Matra.
and pushed ahead his convict-settlement idea. Capital
executions were horrifyingly numerous in the early years
of the settlement. They were not sufficiently numerous-
for the flower-nursing Banks. Phillip and Hunter re-
prieved many. Banks had served King on previous
occasions, and hoped to serve him still by friendly
admonitions when he became Governor over as wretched,
a lot of human beings as was ever huddled together.
His advice was against mercy, and for hanging.
As a public man Banks was to Australia good and bad A
more bad than good —and unless on the ground that worse-
men are already statued in Australia, he has no claim to-
bronze or marble existence in a public place.

“ X was prospecting about two years ago in search
of a good piece of land to select. During my explorations
I chanced on an old digger’s hut between Caramba and the
fringe of the big Dorrigo scrub. In this hut I found a
bottle of Capilla Hair Tonic and as my hair was falling at
the time, I tried the ‘ Capilla ’ and I found, after using it
a few times, my hair ceased falling out—and 1 assert
positively that there is also a thick ‘ down * all over the
part where my hair was so thin, and I have every con-
fidence that the ‘ down ’ will develop into strong, healthy
hair.” From Mr. W. Hunt, Bonville, via Coff s Harbor,

“M. 8.”: “Hamer” (8., 26/l/’O5) writes
absolute rot about snake-bitten persons mostly
dying from fright or whisky. It’s not fright or
whisky that kills bitten animals. I have seen
two dogs bitten—one by a black, the other by a
brown, snake, and each dog died within half an
hour. Also, has “Hamer” never heard of a
horse dying from snake-bite ? I should feel sorry
for the relatives of those who should follow the
advice “Hamer” (inferentially) gives—simply not
to worry and let things take their course.
* * V *
“Gil”: Agree that most snake-bitten
victims would recover if simply left to themselves
and did not worry. Knew a swaggie who, being
bitten, walked six miles to an hotel, where he
arrived in a semi-dazed condition. Some good
people gave him a little whisky and walked him
about for best part of 24 hours. The man
recovered, though nothing more was done for him.
“Alex M.”: To “Itan” (8., 16/2/’O5).
The insect inquired about is a Brachinus, or
“ Bombardier ’’-beetle. The whole family (cara-
bidae, or ground-beetle) to which it belongs have
the power of expelling an intensely acrid fluid,
which in the Bombardier’s case is so volatile that
upon contact with the air it explodes into a smoke-
like vapor. Some of them can thus fire 20 suc-
cessive “rounds.”

He was a shearer—“ Adelaide Bill ” they
called him—and he had but one eye :
“ Strike me fat! ”he exclaimed, when I asked him what
had become of the other ; “ yer not onlike the that
corsed the loss of it. ’Old on till I tell yer about it. I
cums ’ere this time two years ago, and I gits the blight

the first day we started to ’ook ’em out of the pen, an’,
lookin’ at me, ’e says : ‘ Would you like your eyes cured ? ’
‘My oath ! ’ says I. He gives me a bottle of somethin’
like red ink, an’ on it was writ: ‘ Place 10 drops in each
eye after every meal and at bed-time. Keep the eves
wide open and blink a lot.’ I tried it on one eye, and in
three days out drops the blessed peeper. Oh, the other
one’s orlright, and I ’ope to Gord to ’ave me sight wen I
strike that cow of a doctor, as he called hisself. He giv
me a perscription afore ’e went away in case the one
bottle wasn’t enough. ’Ere it is.” I took it, and read :
“To enny chemmiss. Nine (ix) granes of strike-nin, 4
granes of armonium, dilooted and mixt together well,
after which take a corosiv suplement.” “ I ’ear,” said
Bill, in conclusion, “ that the blanker is over at Hamilton
Downs. Gord ’elp ’im wen I get a ’orse.”

“L.L.D.” : Talk about tired men ! On a
blazing hot day in a God forsaken part of Wes-
tralia I came to cross-roads, and didn’t know
which to take. Spotted an aborigine lying in
the dust, and woke him. Rising on one elbow, he
opened one eye. “ Which track goes to ? ” I
asked. He slowly sank again ; and, as he closed
his eye, he said, “ Too plurry ’ot to yabber.”

Some people in North Queensland have
become large property-owners out of the wages of
Tommy Tanna. In the old days, when our
colored brother had finished his term, he often
had from £lO to £25 to draw. This sum he
usually handed over to the storekeeper to mind
for him, and in return received a receipt (un-
dated), which he also handed to the storekeeper
to mind. There was one storekeeper who had
a sum of £9OO to mind, and he built three houses
and let them at 12s. 6d. a week each. He knew
that Tanna would only want about ss. or 10s. a
time to spend, and on an average he (the store-
keeper) only had to have about £3 or £4 a week
handy. If Tanna required anything in the way
of goods (including rum), he got the same from
the storekeeper, and it went off his money. If he
wanted a large sum to gamble with and insisted,
he was given grog (doctored), and he gave no
further trouble for 24 hours ; then it was time for
him to get back to work. The storekeeper was
a banker who gave no interest, and often annexed
about half the deposit. During the last few
years Tanna has got more sense, and the last
Government Savings Bank report showed a credit
to the niggers of £15,000.

“Jan.” : Be domestication of the wombat
(“Harry 5.,” 8., 26/l/’O5). This animal is very
subject to a filthy skin-disease, which is con-
tagious to humans, and often causes much suffer-
ing to men who have skinned or otherwise handled
the brutes. It is believed in Gippsland that the
disease may also be contracted by eating the flesh,
and I do not know of any authenticated cure.
“J.E.8.”: Be ants (B. 2/2/’O5). Darwin
(“ Origin of Species ”) says of a common European
ant (Formica refuseus) : “It is absolutely
dependent on its slaves. Without their aid the
species would certainly become extinct in a single
year. The males and fertile females do not work.
The workers and sterile females, though most
energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do
no other work. They are incapable of making
their own nests, or of feeding their own larvae.
When the old nest is found inconvenient, and
they have to migrate, it is the slaves which deter-
mine the migration, and actually carry their
masters in their jaws.” Of another ant, Formica
sanguinea, Darwin says: “ The slaves are black
and not above half the size of their red masters.
They are household slaves. ” In Switzerland the
ant-slaves habitually work with their masters in
making the nest, and they alone open and close
the doors in the morning and evening. Their
principal work is to search for aphides, which are
to the ant what cows are to man. In a recently-
Sublished “ Romance of the Animal World,” by
Idmund Selons, we are told of ants which plant
seed, from which they harvest grass, and strip and
store grain ; and of others which grow mushrooms,
march in armies, and put wild animals to flight.

“ Polstan ” : Hares are great fighters.
When in captivity they will scratch like demons.
Saw a young one lay a cockatoo out with a slap
on the head with its paw, recently, for giving
cheek. Also know of several cases where ferrets,
put into logs to get puss out, have had to retreat,
badly punished ; in one instance, the ferret never
came out again. Hare laid him out. Yet ferrets
can, and generally do, move foxes. By the way,
it has often been said that hares will not seek
cover. A badly-harassed hare likes a hollow log
as much as a rabbit does, and he is a terror to get
out—chopping is about the only way to do it.

A recent telegram to M.L. metropolitan
newspapers, told that the Premier, travelling
through the West Coast, had visited “The Lost
Tribes.” This strange name for a settlement was
curiously gained. Nearly 40 years ago a number
of diggers and their families crossed the coastal
ranges and disappeared from civilisation for nearly
three decades. They re-acquired many primaeval
habits, and when the fringe of spreading popula-
tion at length reached “the tribes,” the members
resented the intrusion, drew their welta robes over
their eyes, and stated something equivalent to
“git hon ! ” In present days the methods of “the
tribes” remain archaiac, and there is record in the
printed reports of a Government Railway Commis-
sion that a “Lost Tribe” witness who appeared
before the Commission knew nothing of his sur-
name. He gave evidence as plain Tom, and in the
report he was written down as “ Thomas Nemo.”

“H.W.V.” : Re “early birds.” Magpies
often warble at midnight when there is a moon.
Have also heard them flying in the night time.
“ Ghost ” : I think shearing isn’t the
game it is cracked up to be. Looked over a
Both well (Tas.) shed recently; four shearers
at work, and in 15 minutes they shore four
sheep ! They seemed to be sharpening their
shears, and eating hard cake, and drinking
cold tea most of the time. Perhaps they had
the job by the day ? Most rememberable
features of the occasion were the girl showing
me round and the click, click, click—clack,
clack, clack of an ancient, demented-looking
wool-press at the far end of the shed. Nobody
swore, or yelled “tar,” or anything like
that; the game wasn’t as lively as counter-
jumping or Christian Endeavoring.

dingo’s scalp to fetch £l5 or even £2O. I know
a case where a trapper worked for a couple of
months and eventually trapped a “special
lot,” scalp which brought £25.

“ Itan ” : Re Australia’s “lack of in-
digenous fruit and grain ” (Bulletin,
26/l/’O5). In the scrub of the Brunswick
and Tweed Rivers, there is a wild plum
which makes excellent jam. In same dis-
tricts are two or three native limes, or
lemons, rather small, which might prove
valuable for grafting. They are scaleless and
blightless. The Botanic Gardens people in
Sydney would do good service if they paid
some attention to the preservation of the
few edible fruits which are indigenous,
because, like the blacks and the emus, they
do not “play chanies” with civilisation.
Along the river banks of the Clarence a berry
grows on a vine, known locally as the “ wild
grapes,” which is of nice flavor, but punishes
afterwards with nausea. Cultivation and
grafting would no doubt improve it.
“Big Mary”: Pooncarie (generally called
Pun-carie by the Darlings) is not “a sand-heap
about 100 miles above Wentworth, on the Dar-
ling” (“Poverty Point,” 8., 16/2/’O5). It is,
according to its leading residents, one of the best
known ports on the river. Nothing pleases the
inhabitants more than to hear the place alluded to
by visitors as Port Pooncarie. I have seen as many
as one boat tied to a tree there at a time. It is
in such desolations that the “ weird expectancy of
Outback ” is seen at its worst; for there is, on
the faces of the half-forgotten Civil servants, the
“past earin’” look of those who despair of escape
from exile. When State seivants have been,
immured in these soul-strangling remotenesses for
10 years or so, their eyes take on an uncanny
gleam, due to brooding over the apathy of their
departmental heads, who live in luxurious capitals.
God or a good Government should release many
of these prisoners of Very-Out-Back.

“Yarrum”: When a fence was being
run along the N.S.W. border on account of the
Queensland tick, a parson, who travelled that way
with the stock inspector, “couldn’t understand
how any fence could be constructed to block so
small a creature as a tick,” and waxed very wroth
over the “ silly waste of public money.”
“ V.D.” : Concerning the speed of flies,
they may often be seen to fly in one window of a
railway carriage and out of the other and then
unconcernedly keep up with, or even shoot past
the carriage. But then they are probably helped
along by the wind made by the train.

REV. M'SNAGG : “Sally, I bin give Combo tea

SALLY (arnoyed): “ You gib Combo tea and

“ Ed.” : Some greyhounds get very expert
at throwing a kangaroo. I krjow of a light little
dog that can throw the biggest of ’roos when
running. The faster the pace, the more sudden
the fall. The dog runs alongside, reaches across
and grips the off-hind-leg, and with a sudden pull
sideways the Too comes down. A forked stick,
by-the-way, is the only thing that will keep a Too
off if one attacks you. If no stick is available,
lie down ; the Too can’t then use his dangerous
hind-claws. With a stick you can t hit a Too with
a side stroke—he ducks under it; but a downward
hit will always floor him.

“ Wongin ” : A footnote in the journal
of Landsborough’s explorations gives the origin of
billabong as from “ billy,” meaning pitcher, and
“bong,” meaning empty (literally dead). This
would give to both “billy” and “bong” an
aboriginal source.

“Flabby Paul”: Know a cocky up here
(North Queensland) who has had very hard luck.
He applied for 160 acres. His
application wasgranted. Started
to work, and cleared 15 acres
of scrub, when the Government
surveyor came along and dis-
covered that the cocky was on
a State reserve. The surveyor
explained to him, on the map,
where his land was situated.
The cocky shifted, and carefully
started clearing the selection
adjoining his ovvn—the owner
of it being away. He (the
owner) turned up later (after
10 acres were cleared) and
ordered the cocky off. The
cocky refused—saying it was
his own land. He was con-
vinced after a lot of trouble, and
then he consulted a solicitor to
know whether he could get
compensation from the man
whose land he had cleared, or
whether he could get the sur-
veyor the sack, or would it be
better to sue the Government.
The solicitor told him he was very fortunate not
to be prosecuted for trespass, and took his bit
of land in payment for the information. Conse-
quently the cocky starts afresh without any en-
cumbrances.

“Jasper”: Be “What the White can
do ” (B. 19/l/’O5). On the Lower Burdekin cane-
cutting is finished, and some of the men are grub-
bing, fencing, &c., on piece-work. For grubbing,
Is. 6d. a tree is paid, timber under 6in. not count-
ing. Very few make more at this than tucker.
Same conditions prevail in fencing-contracts, men
wearing out what few rags they had when they
came on the job, and departing nearly in the
nude. This work is to prepare the ground for
cane intended to be registered for the white labor
bonus. If men can do this work in mid-summer,
they can surely do cane-cutting, which is over
before the hot weather really commences, and, for
a sweaty job, is not to be compared with many
other kinds of work the white performs without
thinking he is doing anything out of the ordinary.
And yet the planters continue to bemoan the im-
pending loss of their darling savages, and would
stop at nothing to discourage white men from
getting a footing among them.
“ Wobbegong ” : Sydney Harbor is laying
claim to its “Pelorus Jack.” There is an old
porpoise cruising about in Port Jackson, who at
some period of his career lost the extreme part of
his tail, bitten off, presumably, by a shark. How-
ever, every time he comes to the surface, prepara-
tory to diving again, he gives the water a tremen-
dous smack with his stump-ended
tail, making a sound like the
beating of a carpet. This seems
to give the old fellow no little
satisfaction, as he doe 3 it with
great vim. He does not con-
sort with the other porpoises,
but follows at a respectful
distance, as if, in losing his
tail, he had lost caste, and
had the deformity line
drawn against him.

“ Walrick. ” : Where

“W. J. S.” :
There is a large,
sooty-grey moth
which at night
takes possession
(after flying
about all day) of
wilga, native-
orange, and
other whitewood
trees. It builds nests,
not unlike a “chignon”
in shape and structure, in
the branches, well out of the
reach of predatory enemies.
Often when, after walking a long, hot
stage, I have thrown myself down for the night,
after lighting a fire under one of these leafy
trees, these moths would start to swoop down on
my fire in scores. No circling round the flames,
but deliberate suicide. In the morning my camp
would look like a battlefield, with dead and
wounded lying all round, and giving forth a
sickening smell.

“Walg” : Have recently been obliged to
use “bore” water, and I only wish the gentle-
man who wrote about “ drinking artesian water
from a thousand feet below ” was condemned to
“ use no other ” for six months or so. His enthu-
siasm would be effectually slain. The water
carries about 20 per cent, of soda, and wherever it
passes it leaves a thick white coat of the deposit.
It kills vegetables, corrodes iron pipes, and makes
the unfortunate drinker thereof look like a ring-
barked sapling.

They are spelling kangaroo in different
ways in some of the English periodicals. ‘'Kan-
garoo ” receives favor. That is Captain Cook’s
way, and he said he had the word from the natives.
Tt is obvious, though, he hadn’t the spelling from
them. And aborigines in general d on ’t know the
beast as kangaroo or anything similar. “Patago-
rang” was a common native name, and “baggary”
another. Governor Phillip wrote it “kangurroo,”
but he mis-spelt common English words. G. B.
Barton’s notes on the word leave the spelling
doubtful.
FIGHTING THE HEAT.
Another hot spell prophesied. Preparations up

“A.P.R.”: Somebody asks, why don’t
Australians “siest” (new verb)? In towns like
Coonamble and Walgett, where the mercury
remains at over 100° for weeks, it seems absurd to
do the chief business in sweltering afternoons,
instead of, say, 7 p.m. (Memo. —Our midsummer
daylight lasts 15 hours.) The mid-day camp is
popular with all bushmen, especially drovers, who
siest three or four hours; jackeroos have tried
hard to inaugurate the siesta, but the usual result
of the boss finding Hawhaw, Esq., under a shady
tree at 11 a.m, is that the latter is next day seen
“ taking his hook. ” # #
“ Whaffor” : Witnessed a native “ burial ”
recently in Kimberley (W. A.). After cutting the
body and smearing their own bodies with the blood,
the mourners placed the corpse in the boughs of a
tree. Then a painted, howling crowd danced
round the trunk. They gashed themselves with
sharp stone and shells, and threw themselves
violently on the ground.

“ Agrityro Ee “ Matchbox’s” query (B.
9/2/ , 0o) concerning the indifference of Horsham
(Vic.) farmers to scientific agriculture as con-
trasted with those of Nhill, in similar dis-
trict. One reason is the idiotic way in
which Longerenong Agricultural College
(eight miles from Horsham) was managed.
Writer came from the Cold Country with
the idea of going on the Australian land ;
thought to gain a few ideas at an
agricultural college, and by
ill-luck chose Longerenong.
Proved to be a hotbed of
political interference, crass
ignorance of farming con-
ditions, and inseparable
red-tape. The princi-
pal, to demonstrate
the value of rape
as a crop to fat-
ten lambs for early
market, sowed
some, and got a
small mob of lambs
ready for sale in a
very short time, but
was kept waiting six
weeks forpermission
to sell. Result, local
ridicule. Later, tiro
college was closed
“on account of the
drought,” although, by
surface cultivation
only, ninety-day maize
was brought to per-
fection, and peaches
lOoz. weight were
gathered from trees
which had neither rain
nor water for five clear
months. With the claims
and results of science thus
flouted by the authorities, no wonder the Horsham
farmers follow suit.

“Janor”: In drawing the bark-roof,
The Bulletin artists are always wrong about
the logs which “anchor” the roof—known as
riders ’ and “jockeys.” The first-named are
perpendicular, in pairs ; and the ends overlapping
the ridge are loosely held together with wooden
pins, to allow their spread to conform to the roof-
angle and lie close to the bark when the weight of
the jockey coineson their loose ends—those nearest
the eaves. The jockeys are laid horizontally across
these lower ends, and are held in position by
wooden pegs driven into the underlying rider.
But the artist always draws the rider on top of the
jockey, “ which is absurd,” as the geometry-books
say.

Muscovy flesh is general amongst the natives of

“Eel.”: “ W.E.’a ” self-closing gate (8.,
9/2/’O5) is no novelty, but this is : A sapling with
a heavy root was fastened on a gate-post by a bolt
sft. from the ground, the root on one side of the
post, sapling on the other. The whole moved
round this bolt, the bolt-hole being 3ft. from the
foot end. Hanging downwards from the sapling
was light lattice-work. A cord, with a handle in
a conyenient position, released the spring-catch,
and with the same movement the gate was jerked
upwards. There was ample time for a buggy to
pass through before the gate descended slowly
back to closed position.

“ Buzz ”: He the rough-and-ready methods
of the blacks. I once rescued a young lubra (while
bathing in Wide Bay) from a shark. She got away
with her foot, bitten clean off at the ankle. After
I got the girl ashore (not a white man within
1G miles), the blacks made a paste of mangrove
ashes and clay and plastered it on to the stump.
The wound was thereafter left so for 12 days, and
was then re-covered with the same stuff. It was
never washed. In less than two months the
girl was going about with the aid of a stick, and
never seemed to suffer much discomfort or pain
after the first week.

“War E”: “ Nardoo ” (B. 26/l/’O5) de-
fends phosphorus and maintains that it is keeping
the rabbits in check. It is doing nothing of the
kind ; despite the 2000 distributors at work in
N.S.W., bunny is more numerous to-day than 10
years ago, and the fact that there is such ah out-
cry for more drastic means of checking the pest
(there’s no such word as ‘ ‘ eradicating ’’ when speak-
ing of bunny) isn’t too good an “ad” for phos-
phorus. My experience, extending over many
years, is decidedly in favor of poisoned water, it
makes short work of the rabbits. There is, I
admit, much damage dona to natural fauna by its
use, but in the hands of a careful man far less than
can be laid to the account of phosphorus.

“ Hodge ” : “ War E.” (B. 26/l/’O5)
asserts that sheep will, if left to themselves,
escape from a bush fire ; and that the boundary-
rider ought not to interfere with them in such
circumstances. Well, my experience is that sheep
will run before a bush fire until—if not previously
overtaken by it —brought up by a fence, which, if
left to themselves, they will follow to a Corner,
where they will remain till roasted to death.
Pure nonsense to allege that only the outside
sheep will be scorched. The fire would run
through, under, and over them. As if greasy
wool wouldn’t burn !

“Ess”: The beetle industry in Queens-
land provides pocket-money for a host of people-
including hard-up tramps—during the cane season.
In one month recently the Cairns Beetle Board
paid for two tons of borers at Is. per pound—now
dropped to Gd. per pound. When the bonus for
beetle-scalps was started a few seasons back, the
insects were counted by the receivers, but the col-
lectors brought them in such vast numbers that the
expedient of paying by weight was adopted. Then
the nippers soaked the catch over nignt, and the
increase of expenditure on beetle-destruction was
so marked that soon the old method of counting
was reverted to.

no question of colored labor involved in the Orient Co.’s

tralia allows that the Orient Co. is mistaken on that
point. That’s the situation in a nutshell. It calls for no

A photo, of Jap. General Nogi and staff

A Melb. lift-expert got something of a
shock, the other day. After effecting repairs in a
fashionable hotel he sent the cage to the top of
the shaft, and almost immediately pulled the rope
to bring it down again. His hair nearly turned
grey when two ladies stepped out as the lift
reached the ground-floor. Melbourne is the one
civilised city in the world where it is quite usual
to leave a lift without an attendant, to be worked

James Edmond from Bombay :
Asia has no “ weird expectancy ”as Australia has. It
doesn’t expect anything except to remain the same old
Asia. It is waiting all the time, but for nothing in
particular. An immense proportion of Ceylon is still
jungle, and an immense proportion of the people stand
around so that you would almost expect jungle to grow
on them. Everywhere you meet Asia walking six miles
in his bare feet, and carrying £lb. of something in his
hand ; or he will stand three-ciuarters-of-an-liour urging
you to buy some trash for a rupee, or five cents, or some-
thing equally ridiculous ; or you will see four of him
cutting one square foot of grass ; or eight of him
hollering to one bullock about the sine of a cock-
roach, or three of him cackling wildly to three more
to come and help them to lift a box that an Aus-
tralian lumper would pick up with one hand.
There are about 180 servants in a big hotel —one waiting
at each table, and one hanging about at almost every
door in case he should be wanted, and one on each side of
the front door, and two on the steps, and 50 buzzing
around generally, doing nothing visible to the naked eye.
There are brown men in the streets who want a com-
mission for helping you into the shop into which you
would have gone in any case. If you are going into
a Colombo tobacconist’s, some irresponsible brown per-
son fastens on you outside, says “Good cigars, master,”
buzzes in with you, helps you to call" out to the
tobacconist, gives you his moral support during the trans-
action, and—doesn’t ask for any money. lie only walks
alongside you afterwai Is till you give him some. At a
railway station about eight men struggle for your bag',
and four more holler hr a rickshaw for you. At Mount
Lavinia hotel, near Colombo, a native camped outside the
hotel verandah with his eye on me for three hours. When
at last I came off the verandah I found that he wanted
25 cents to show me a house where a Boer captain lived
when a prisoner in Ceylon. Three more natives dropped
from the skies to help him show me the house. 1 found
the first one was an official guide, so I gave him 25 cents
to go away. . The other three wouldn’t depart, so I
walked back into Colombo—about eight miles—to tire
them out. They gave up after about three miles. There
is an immensity of work waiting to be done here, but
Asia is so busy buzzing round trying to sell you a toy
elephant half an inch long that it hasn’t time to do the
work. It hasn’t even the least idea that the work needs
doing. The Cingalese laborer makes about 33 cents (say
6d., or a third of a rupee) daily, and he isn’t worth more.
So far, in short, Asia strikes me as the ant which is
always carrying the leg of a dead grasshopper up one side
of a stone and down the other.
Concerning a matter of little consequence :
A while ago, Dill Macky’s Botciiman, out after sectarian
strife, pulled a R.O. temperance preacher into its mischief-
making, and said that most of the Bung business was in
the hands of the Mickies. The Bulletin, which doesn’t
care one empty beer-bottle more for the Micky than the
Macky, but does want to keep sectarian bitterness out of
Australia, told the little mischievous insect to look
after the beer in its own eye and let the whisky in
the other fellow’s alone ; and it remarked, to prove
that there was considerable beer in that eye, that
in the Bung and Narcotic business (which it was
mentioned couldn’t be separated) there were something
over 800 Methodists employed in N.S. Wales, The
Methodists were chosen for example because they
happen to be the sect which puts about the heaviest foot
down on the Curse ; yet in spite of that, there was this
large amount of “ beer and bacca ” in their eye, requ : ring
attention. Thereupon parsons have
thrown about large quantities of angry denial, and wan t
proof. The Spectator wants the names of 10 persons
“ responsibly engaged in the hotel or liquor business who
are members of the Methodist Church.” But The
Bulletin isn’t going to be limited like that. It doesn’t
know who are T< members ” of the Methodist Church ; it
only knows those who described themselves as Methodists
in the Census papers, and who said they dealt in or handled
liquors or narcotics. Of the population engaged in or
manufacturing stimulants and dealing in and manufac-
turing narcotics tha Census office says there are about 200
Methodists ; the exact figures cannot be got out, but that
is the estimated maximum. Of those keeping and
working in hotels there are 500 —estimated in the same
way. In addition to these there are persons engaged in
clubs, in caf6s supplying liquor, and a large number in
groceries which hold bottle licenses, besides vignerons.
The number of Methodists engaged in grocery stores, and
also there, handle liquor, cannot be definitely arrived at,
but is estimated to be greater than the number of those
who are employed in hotels. So the total of those in the
“ beer and tobacco ” business is greater than was first men-
tioned by The Bulletin, in spite of the whirling words of
the parsons who characteristically said it was untrue first
and asked for proof afterwards. And even then there
haven’t been |included the names of the very big Method-
ists who are the landlords of pubs and and wine and spirit
stores. Would the Spectator like some of those names
for a start —or is It sinful to sell whisky, but not sinful to
take some of the proceeds from the man who sells it, for
providing him with a place to sell it in?
IDENTIFYING BEER.
Melbourne, Sunday.—How is beer to be identified?
riiis question has arisen in a purely legal sense. The
Chief Commissioner of Police points out that it is a
question of fact for magistrates to decide, and even if it
should be held necessary for a constable to taste beer in
order to identify it—well, the police could even meet that
difficulty. —News Item.
Saynior-Consthable Murphy : “ Well, art it
plase yer ’Anner, there was thirteen glasses av
liquid riposin' upon th' bar-r-r, an\ bein' 1 a
little bit wake both in th ’ sinse av smell an’ av
soight, Oi shwallowed the lot, wid th’ rausult
thot Oi come to th ’ concloogin it wer beer—
an (hie) ba-a-d beer, too, yer ’Anner.”
Christian Intelligencer tells a story of
England’s beloved ally the Jap :
Lying, concealment, “ saving the face,” is a fine art in
fv ia Y,-S ne Jap ’ hel P‘ n - a missionary in a translation of
the Bible, staggered at the words “Cannot lie,” and
refused to believe that God is omnipotent. “ How can
He be the Almighty, if He cannot lie?” he asked.

CLOTHING THE COfUTONWEALTH.
• LEADER OF MERCHANT TAILORS.
R. C. HAOON’S ENTERPRISE.
THERE is, at least, one establishment in
Sydney that never has time to do anything
but look ahead, go ahead, and keep ahead.
It has never been allowed a “ tired feel-
ing ” or a timorous inter-
val to pause and reflect on
past achievements. It
knows that in order to be
first favorite it must not
rely on a reputation, but
must keep that reputa-
tion all the time and
right up to the living
present. That establish-
ment is R. 0. Hagon’s,
12!) King-street, Sydney,
l't is just 20 years since
Mr. Hagon launched his
enterprise with one
cutter and 20 employees
who produced 100 gar-
ments a week. How
great has been the ex-
pansion is shown by to-
day’s figures : There are
now five cutters and 150
employees—some of the
hands dating their con-
nection with the house
since its inception, a
score of years ago —and
the garments, (>OO weekly.
This represents the
largest turn-over of any
tailoring establishment
in the States.
It will interest the
public to know that every
piece of material, before
being made into a
garment, is shrunk
on the new London
principle, and inspection
of the process is invited
at the buildings, which
are illumined throughout
with electric light.
It has been Mr. Hagon’s
aim to give his patrons
the beat of material, the cleverest of cuts, and the
most perfect of finishes at the lowest of rates
compatible with quality and skill- the essentials
to success in a discriminating Commonwealth.
A characteristic of Australians is their demand

for the best—and notin'ng but the best. Theatrical
managers have to arrange for the very best of
stage productions by the very best of artistes.
And so with every other desire or demand of
the great heart and dis-
cerning eye of the Aus-
tralian. And he wants
the best at bedrock
rates.
Mr. R. 0. Hagon was
quick to discover this
quaint, economical, but
quite defensible, idio-
syncrasy of clients,
now numbered like a
modern army, and scat-
tered throughout the
island continent. H e
secured the latest, the
most fashionable and
the most durable
materials from the
world’s manufactories.
He did more : he secured
expert fitters, cutters,
designers and makers,
and gave a sound busi-
ness satisfaction to
clients that has spelt
success for the favorite
house at 129 King-street,
Sydney. By stead-
fastly pursuing the
policy of the best
material and the best
workmanship, the repu-
tation of the establish-
ment expands, and the
free interchange of
articles throughout the
States gives the citizen
of any part of the Com-
monwealth, however
remote, the advantage
and opportunity of deal-
ing directly with R. C.
Hagon.

Dookie Agricultural College (Vic.) is conducting
useful hybridising experiments in regard to wheat and
oats and barley. Principal Pye has over 150 plots, hand-
sown, with different grains. The grains are hybridised
carefully by hand, and all details of each experiment duly
noted. The outcome is quaint, just as the life of a wheat-
grain is interesting ; for of all Nature’s gifts wheat is one
of the few self-inoculating. In some rows there are not
two heads to be found alike—some stalks holding heads a
foot long, others but a few inches. Some grains are
covered with heavy, coarse husks ; others the reverse.
Over fifty beardless types of barley are under observation,
and oats receive due attention also. To protect these
valuable plots the sparrow has to be catered for, and a
large plot of barley has been planted handy to keep his
attentions off the experimental area. Next to the
sparrow pest, principal Pye classes the petticoat searcher
after knowledge, and gives an example. A lady of a
visiting party pulled up a bunch of wheat growing handy,
and asked innocently what he called that? Without
moving a muscle, Pye replied that he called it six years of
hard research thrown away ! It was his pet bunch of
hybridised bread-stuff. All these experiments are being
carried out under any unfavorable condition that may
present itself to the mind of the experimenter, that the
types may be evolved to meet the peculiarities of climate
wherever they may be adopted eventually.

“ Flabby Paul ”: Struck the meanest firm. It
has branches and agencies all over the place. A little
widow vainly tried to make a living in a hotel “ tied ” to
the firm. She was unsuccessful, and ended up about £lOO
in debt. The firm, in an overwhelming rush of gene-
rosity, gave her daughter (a girl of 17) a billet in its
drapery department, at the wage of 7s. 6d. a week, on
condition that 2s. fid. a week be deducted towards the
liquidation of the mother’s debt.

“Jack Shay” : Remember taking part in a rob-
bery—at least, another man called it a robbery. Swagging
it once, struck a N.S.W. country town on the annual race
day. Being stiff, mate and self left our money on the
fence, and went into the races—the man watching the
fence was otherwise engaged and didn’t see us. Put in
he day, knocked about the town at night, and camped
on the course. When day broke we set to work and
rooted round the “ring” and the bough-shed
booth; result, half-a-sovereign and 4s. 6d. in silver.
Met the caretaker of the course as we were
leaving, and told him we had camped under
the stand. He rode over to the stand, but ten
minutes after caught up to us on the road. “Watcher
been doing over there?” he yelled. “Only camping,”
we answered. “ D’yer pick any money up ? ” “ Money ! ”
—our astonishment was sublime. “ Yes, yes, yous
dashed robbers ! Give it to me, or I’ll put the police on
yer." We advised him to try jumping at himself, or to
get hold of himself by one ear and throw himself at him-
self. How he did foam and roar ! The sergeant of
police came along in time to join in. We admitted we
had money—what was left of our last wages. The
sergeant shook his head. “ Can’t do anything, Bill,” he
said, and rode off. Bill followed us for about a mile out
of town, and from saying, “ Yes, yous did, you blanky
robbers,” he came down at last to asking us what we
thought of ourselves, and how we expected a poor man to
live. We advised him to get work, and live honestly, and
give up trying to cadge from two poor but honorable lads
swagging it in search of graft. That settled him.

“Drifter” tells how he didn’t have a drink:
Went into a wine bar t’other night and called for half-a
pint of claret. An unsavory-looking woman searched for
the mixture among bottles on a shelf, and not finding it,
told me in thick, greasy accents she would get some from
“on draught.” Then she dived beneath the bar. Seized
with curiosity, I slipped round unobserved to watch the
process. First she sorted out a length of gutta percha
tubing from amongst the dead marines, old cigarette
boxes, and other rubbish. Then, after inserting an end
of the tube through a hole in the top of a cask, she held
the wine glass close down, put the tube in her mouth,
and gave it a suck. The mouthful she received she spat
out over the cigarette boxes. Then, with the stream of
wine coming down this rough syphon, she filled my glass.
I fled.
* * * *
“ Stev ” : It was a few years ago, when Honolulu
was experimenting with a view to establishing an export
trade in cucumbers to Barcelona. The other fellow was a
carpenter, who followed shipping work—building horse-
stalls, fitting up cold chambers and freezing compart-
ments. He may have lied, but this is what he told me
“ We worked day and night, and fitted up one of the holds
as a cold chamber for a trial shipment of asparagus the
Yokohama Government was sending to Kamstchatka. We
finished, and all the men but myself went home. I had
to stand by. The Government inspector was to pass the
chamber, and, if he required any little alteration, I was to
do it. He came aboard, and adjourned to the saloon for
an hour before he inspected. He passed everything as
0.K., and retreated to the saloon again. When he went
ashore, the lamp-trimmer or some other officer came to
me and said, ‘ Get too, and pull all that flaming lumber
out of the way ! ’ With the assistance of some of the crew,
it was down and stacked away in one-twentieth of the
time it took a dozen carpenters to build it. As soon as it
was cleared the lumpers rushed in the cases of tomatoes
and stacked them up as if the contents were blue-metal.
I afterwards saw that those horse-radishes arrived in Peru
in a rotten condition ; and that the Government of
Sumatra had abandoned its attempt to help its fanners by
proving that strawberries could be successfully exported
to Devonshire.

“ T.D.” : Even some of the steamer companies
trading Englandwards via Chow Africa have lately deve-
loped “ derry ” on the Australian : passengers going right
through notice a marked difference between the treat-
ment from Sydney to the Cape and from Capetown on-
wards. For the first half of the \ oyage poor provisions
are used, the water is bad, bread is made from sour flour,
and dinner runs the limited gamut of sea pie, Irish stew,
potato pie, and hot-pot, which all turn-out to be one and
the same thing. But after passing Capetown the Sydney-
side poultry and the Victorian rabbit and the Tasmanian
apple are allowed to walk out of the refrigerator much
more frequently, and the sour flour is stowed away for
the next lot of Australian passengers.
* * * *
“G.H.” : Saw three alleged Stradivarius violins
advertised, the other day, at prices ranging from 30s. to
555. One advt. spelt it “ Stradivarious ” ; and it was pro-
bably right. A genuine Strad. costs about as much as a
brick house; and it is doubtful if there are more than
one or two of them in Australia altogether. Judging by
the wanted-to-sell advts., one would think that Mr.
Stradivarius chopped his violins out with an axe at the
rate of one a minute.
* * * *
Protectionist Maoriland’s latest is the dried-
milk industry. First factory for its manufacture was
opened near Palmerston recently. Europe has several
factories where the stuff is run as a by-product on a small
scale ; but M.L. is the first to go the whole hog with the
new product. Process is simple enough : After test, the
milk is filtered, then sent to the drying room, where it is
run over heated rollers till only the solids are left in
large, crinkled cream sheets. This is taken to a sifting
room, sifted at the rate of a ton per hour, and then
packed for sale. Packing is done by hand at present, but
an automatic packer, with a 12,000-tins-per-day capacity,
is on its way from America. Already the local demand
for the new product is strong, and the enterprising
initiators expect to knock out “ condensed milk ” forth-
with m the local market at least. Well, you ten-times-
as-big, half-Protected Australia?
* * * *
Herald published recently an article on
the tanning industry at Botany, N.S.W. It wound up by
would not describe the proceedings
■whereby the skins which reached Botany from the local
sheep s back departed in the guise of chamois leather,
glace kid (supposed to be the Indian goat-skin), crocodile
sKin, snake skin, and skins from other fearsome beasts.
Jho wonder the threatened interference with private
enterprise on the part of the Australian Parliament by

Just published in the U.S.A., an Authors’ Year Book,
giving hints on how to live by writing. The hints are
mostly good, and applicable to Australia: Authors
should read assiduously the mags, and newspapers to
which they expect to contribute. The “timely” article
is a good dish when served hot; what will be rushed this
week will be shunted next month. The taste for serials
is fading, and for verse increasing. Type-write
clearly your MS. Never address a MS. 'to any
person by name. One well-known author’s advice is
“ When I have a manuscript to offer, I offer it in the
usual way, without even an accompanying note, unless it
is something timely, requiring immediate decision. Nor
lias my acquaintance the slightest influence upon its for-
tune. Indeed, I sometimes think that mjr warmest edi-
torial friends have taken the keenest pleasure in turning
me down. They might, perhaps, have had some delicacy
in the matter had I been a stranger. As it is, they have
not hesitated to tell me that a certain poem or story was
‘ pretty bad stuff.’ ”

E. W. Carey, just now mentioned in Melbourne,
had several jaunts along the inky way With Labor-
ite Prendergast and some Bohemian artists and
writers, he ran the Boomerang, a little Labor
paper started in Premier Patterson’s time. But
the Puritanical sensibilities of Carey and Prendergast
caused friction with the sta'f, which culminated in a
deliberately strong leader on Dean Macartney, entitled,
“ The Dear Dead Dean,” being served up for censorship.
M’Kain, later of Adelaide Critic, was editor, and passed
the article. Carey forbade its insertion. In the row that
followed, Carey, Prendergast and the comps withdrew.
Other comps were got to bring out the paper for the
staff, but the scheme fell through, and the Boomerang
fell to earth. Carey was also in with H. H. Champion in
the Champion ; but once again Carey’s prudery irritated
the writers. Mixed up with the concern were a flock of
“ new ” women, all clamoring for “an equal standard of
morality.” One writer slyly slipped into the paper that
what they were really after was “ an equal standard of
immorality.”. Carey and his chickens were furious,
the writer got slops, and the Champion also went bung.
Finally a quite different kind of Carey, a Carey who had
quarrelled with Champion—a Carey without prudery, and
with liberal purse—ran the Outpost entirely on his own.
The writers and artists with whom formerly he had
quarrelled. were enrolled on his staff, and brought out
what was, at its best, a really smart little paper. It was
the only Melbourne journal which persistently and
thoroughly championed Marshall Hall against Fitchett
and his muckrakes. But the Outpost, too, went bung ;
and then Carey decided to stick to his building society.
Awful slab of irreverence from S.M. Herald book-
notice “It is a constant procession of names and
things and nations—just about as interesting as that
chapter in the Bible which declares that So-and-so was
born of So-and-so, and became in due course the father of
So-and-so.” !! ! Should not the authorities look round
Mr. James’ premises for a book-critic’s mangled corpse at
once?

The irony of the joke entered the imprisoned pressman’s
soul when the gaoler remarked, as he turned the key,
“ You fellows have a soft snap, getting into everything

Randolph Bedford for a while edited Korumburra
(Gippsland) Southern Mail. The monotonous lying
which constitutes country journalism got on his nerves,
and he broke out into occasional sprees of candor. Once
a church concert didn’t advertise with the Mail. Bed-
ford wnt and paid his fare in, which was ominous. Wet
night, poor house, and performers (imported from Melb.)
didn’t care a continental. R.B. reported that concert-
discussed it as nuisances are seldom discussed. The
several oldest inhabitants still speak in subdued accents
of the shock of that excursion of trutnful reporting into
the soapy realms of country-town journalism. Bedford
left soon afterwards.

“Muru” from Maoriland:—Met the editor of The
Bulletin in a bush pub. t’other day. Gazed with reve-
rence upon the unclassical brow and luminous nose of
this arbiter of contributors’ destinies. He was getting
outside a mug of beer at the time. “ They don’t serve
it in buckets ’ere,” he explained, apologetically, noting
my deferential look of inquiry. “Y’ may ’a’ noticed the
paper ain’t been up to standard the las’ few weeks,” he
continued, between acts of suction. “I’m travellin’ fer
me ’ealth, see; and a-eollectin’ hinformation about the
great natural resources of this here glorious country.”
He went on to tell me a number of remarkable secrets
about the paper. “ Come to think of it,” he remarked,
“I ’as most trouble with ther picture blokes. Artists is
that cantankerous. W’y, Norman Lindsay’s wrecked the
premises frequent; an’ McCrae’s bin known to chase the
’ole staff down the street with a gun w’en ’e wasn’t
satisfied with the way ’is picter came out. An’ ’Op !
Anybody ’as seen ’Op’s drorin’ would n’t ’a’ dreamt ’e was
brought up fer a missionary—but he was ” (in a fierce
whisper). “ I alone know the dark secret. Yes ; we
gives George Reid a bad time of it; but, lorbless.ver, ’e
don’t mind. Keeps 'im in the public hye, ’e tells me,
confidential-like. You wouldn’t ’a’ thort me an’George
was cousins. No ; nor anybody else. Fact is, me an’
George orfen ’as a beer together—an’ Reid, ’e never lets
me shout. Yes ;I do n’t mind if I do.”

“ R.” : Conscience-stricken, I herewith confess my
transgressions as “ local correspondent ” of a Sydney daily.
For some time the journal had sullenly refused to print
my wires stating that “ the crops are looking well.”
Lucrative murders were scarce, and my daily income of
sd. receded to zero. In despsir, I sent in a lying descrip-
tion of a “ cross between kangaroo-grass and wheat, per-
fected by a local farmer.” This earned me 2s. ; then,
launched on the ocean of mendacity, I proved that the
drought was ending, because the local divining-rods were
all pointing skywards. Imaginary fires and thunder-
storms followed in quick succession ; and a local man,
nick-named “Tiger,” having visited a neighboring town,
I wired that a tiger had been seen near that place. This
was reprinted throughout N.S.W. and gained great kudos
for the local rum ; even The Bulletin commented upon
it. Fearing that the ill-gotten riches thus amassed
would bring me ill luck, I resigned, to put myself out of
temptation.

“ Stev.”: There is one phase of modern journalism which
calls for censure—the columns of stuff which appear with
scare heads whenever a new discovery in chemistry or phy-
sics is made. “Consumption Conquered,” “A Cure for
Cancer,” “ Hope for the Blind,” and so forth run the head-
ings and cross-headings. Then follows a slab of matter,
more or less imaginary or prophetic, based sometimes on
scientists’ incautious talk, sometimes on a fool’s maunder-
ings. I wonder do the ghouls who print this stuff ever give
a thought to the vain hopes they raise in the minds of the
afflicted. I know of two cancer victims, practically con-
demned to death, and resigned to their fate, whom the
booming of the “ molasses cure ” spurred to fresh fights
for life. Cruel disappointment ensued, and both are since
dead. They would have died anyhow, but in peace.
“ J.P.” : How pars travel. Know a par, written by a
journalist on a Maoriland daily, concerning the frequency
with which vessels whose names bear the initial “ T ” go to
pieces on the Maoriland coast. It was originally published
in Thb Bulletin, was copied (unacknowledged, of course)
by London Daily News, and was then printed (acknow-
ledged to latter) in the opposition paper two streets from
where the author had written it. That par travelled
32,000 miles to get 600 yards.

Adelaide J’s.P. talk of a new journal expressly for the
small unpaid. There are so many of them in S. A. that
the paper might have a good circulation. Whether all of
the J’s.P. could read it is another matter.
Melb. morning papers agree to agree on many matters
in the arrangement of their sheets, but they persist In
differing about others. The Age always spells it Lilly-
dale, the Argus “ Lilydale ” (David Syme ought to know ;
he owns a good slice of that part of Victoria). Some
other regular differences are “ Thibet ” (Argus) and
“ Tibet ” (Age) .; “ Lhassa ” (Argus) and “Lhasa” (Age);
“ Peking ” (Argus) and “ Pekin ” (Age).

English papers announce the death of W. L. Lewis, pro-

A SCRIBE’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is nothing so hollow as pens,
There is nothing so gloomy as ink,
When a writer’s obliged to think of something,
And doesn’t know what to think.
There is nothing so blank as paper,
There is nothing so void as a brain,
W.ien a scribe has an hour to think up a thought,
And has thunk for an hour in vain.
I know how a ghost must feel,
As he tries with his fingers of air
To convey a jugful of foaming beer
To a mouth that isn’t there.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The best immigrant Australia can have is
the little Australian.
A policy for the Commonwealth in a nut-
shell—Down with the fences, up with the factories.
The politician who demands that the
country should be “run on business principles”
sometimes means for his business principals.
Sydney’s Lord Mayor, Allen Taylor, has
formed his timber business into a limited liability
oompany, which can now sell timber to whom it-
pleases, corporation contractors or not.
Who got the commission that Mr. John
See says was so liberally bestowed over the pur-
chase of Myall Creek station by the N.S.W.
Government? It is alleged that one of Mr.
See’s own colleagues got a share.
What a fearful hullabooloo the dailies would
have made about “secret caucuses,” “freedom of
conscience, ” “ the right of the people to know what
their representatives are doing,” and so forth, had
J. 0. Watson been running the Hobart Confer-
ences !
Icicle Irvine isn’t going to have any
absurd walk-over in his Wimmera electorate.
Solly, Labor man, has been up there organising,
and striking unexpected success.
A carriage tax, a footman tax, and an
armorial bearings tax are levied in England. If
levied in Australia they would help the Treasury
a little, and hurt no one who doesn’t deserve to be
hurt.
Encyclical Kelly has resigned his mem-
bership of the Ashfield branch of the N.S.W.
P.L.L. He and Mugwump, of the L.0.L.,
should now form a Cave of Adullam for discon-
tented Laborites.
A MELBOURNE
WINE SHOP ITEM.
LIDY : “Ho! don’t serve no tidies, don’t per?
Wait till I see Billy Maloney. He'll reform
yer.”
Postmaster-General Smith points out for
the edification of the anti-Australian press that
while perishable produce is carried on the Orient
Co.’s boats for £7 a ton, it asks, on the basis of
£150,000 (its first tender), £3OOO a ton for carrying
mail matter.
The agreement between N.S.W. and Vic-
torian Railway Commissioners as to the Riverina
trade ends a long-standing rivalry. As far back
as the days when John Robertson was Premier
the N.S.W. Government was heckled “because
Victoria was pushing her railways to the Murray
faster than N.S. Wales, and would secure the
Riverina trade.” Exasperated at the heckling one
night, Robertson jumped to his feet and protested :
“Mr. Speaker, God Almighty made the country.
I object to being made responsible for the Murray
being further from Sydney than it is from Mel-
bourne.”
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers is not likely
to ask N.S.W. Parliament to amend the Arbitra-
tion Act. Some of his supporters would amend it
out of existence, and the balance of the House
would increase the Court’s powers in favor of
unionism. Between the two stools Joseph would
be mangled.
U.S.A. President Roosevelt, in his first
Presidential message to Congress after his elec-
tion, inferentially upholds the preference-to-
unionists principle of N.S.W. arbitration law.
Unionists, he says, have always a legal, and some-
times also a moral, right to refuse to work side by
side with non-unionists.
N.S.W. Employers’ Federation, which
doesn’t want the Arbitration Act, has decided to
attempt its repeal on the ground that its decisions
can’t be enforced. Which suggests the Employers’
Federation asking for six-penn’orth of prussic acid
to poison a dog, on the ground that the animal is
dead and otherwise harmless.
In evidence before the Navigation Com-
mittee, Mr. Boner, Australian manager for the
North German Shipping Cos., stated that not only
were his subsidised boats forbidden to carry Aus-
tralian butter, milk, grain and meat to Germany,
but the ships themselves must be built of German
materials, and must use German coal exclusively
when available.
“If,” says the Owe’Sullivan, “we build
the railway engines in N.S.W. we shall have the
money and the engines as well.” But, if we stop
at that, neither the money nor the engine will be
ours. The money will belong to Cohen, who lent
it to us; and the engine simply replaces a worn-
out engine that was built with borrowed money,
and therefore will also belong to Cohen. Pro-
tection is good ; but Protection and No More
Borrowing are better.
All Australian political bodies seem unable
to present a series of resolutions to the public in
uniform style. Even the first 14 resolutions
carried at the Hobart Conference are eccentric in
their phraseology. They begin by saying that
certain things “ought to be” done; then they
said that several other things “must” be done;
further, that several others “may” or “might”
be done ; and so on. In every case, by the altera-
tion of two or three words, these mere recommenda-
tions would have assumed proper shape.
S.M. Herald, girding at the Arbitration
Act and the like :
The private employer has no fictitious wag-e-fund to
fall back on. He must pay his men out of the value they
produce. Labor parties might fill the statute-books to-
morrow as they pleased, and in the long run their
statutes would be inoperative, for economics is stronger
than politics.
That’s just where
arbitration pro-
tects the employer.
Workmen often
don’t know what
the employer can
afford. In the
strike days they
sometimes, there-
fore, made impos-
sible demands, and
if they won they
shut that employer
up. Now all that
an employer has to
do is to satisfy a
Supreme Court
Judge that he can’t
afford what is
asked, and there is
an end of it. In-
stead of the deci-
sion resting with a
body of workmen
with no means of
finding out how
matters really
stand, it rests with a Court which has the means
of finding out.
Maoriland has a political cat-in-the-bag
just now, and parties will remain undecided until
it has jumped. The uncertain animal is the land
question, on which a Royal Commission has been
appointed. Said that Mr. Joseph Ward may yet
champion the freehold. He is reported to be
rapidly making a pile out of his grain business,
and is looking forward to acquiring an estate.
Though Westralia will have to import over
a quarter of a million bushels of wheat this year
to feed its handful of people, it has just shipped
250 tons of wheat by the Norfolk to London.
This is to impress the world with the magnificent
resources of Groperland. This year it is esti-
mated that Westralia will import from the Eastern
States eggs, butter, bacon, cheese, fruit, onions,
potatoes, and other nroduce to the value of over
£500,000.
The Liberals in S. A. are in a very awkward
position, for in several districts both the Conser-
vatives and the Labor party are attempting to
win all the seats. Among men thus opposed by
the Labor party are Denny (Kingston’s late col-
league), Scherk, and Cummins, who have been
consistent Democrats. Kirkpatrick, M.L.C., and
Labor leader Price, it is said, both pleaded with
the party not to put up men in Adelaide against
Denny and Scherk (there are four seats).
S. Australia has a bad habit of running its
trains through its principal streets; Adelaide,
Pt. Adelaide, Pt. Pirie and Glenelg all have the
excitement and the soot of this habit. The Vic-
toria Square line, which runs through the long
principal street of Glenelg and through half a mile
of King William-street, Adelaide, is the worst
example. Needless to say, it was Private Enter-
prise that built the line.
“Exile”: Why this terrible outcry for
absolute commercialism in the building of railway
engines ? I seem to remember long reports from
the Commissioners and their officials giving com-
mercial reasons against many railway proposals.
Yet the Government, supported by Parliament,
authorised their construction in the public interest.
Does not the public interest apply to engines
equally with the lines on which they run ?
A LITTLE LEARNING.
“ Now, Mr. Smarty, what do you know about
this race? ”
“ Not much. Enough not to back the favorite,
but not enough to pick the winner.”
England’s suggestion that Canada should
contribute an annual £250,000 for the defence of
Halifax (Nova Scotia) and Esquimault (Britisli
Columbia), leaving the British Govt, full control,
has been promptly snubbed. The Dominion re-
plies that it prefers paying the total cost and re-
taining full control. Compare this dignified and
independent attitude with Australia’s servile
Naval Subsidy !
N.S.W. ex-Premier John See charges that
the Carruthers Government paid far too much for
Myall Creek—the estate resumed recently for
closer settlement. In reply the Lands Minister
gives a flat denial. But there will always be an
atmosphere of suspicion about closer settlement
effected by land purchase. The equitable and
natural way to closer-settle is by a progressive tax
on land values sufficiently high to make it unprofit-
able to hold big estates.
Something is to be said against the pro-
posed settling of Austrians on the sugar lands of
North Queensland if the scheme means that a
colony of Austrians is to be segregated in a
certain area. Europeans who come to blend are
welcome, but not those who want to found a
community within a community. At one time
the preponderance of Germans in one Queensland
electorate caused the election of a member to turn
on German instead of Australian questions.
There was a crowded indignation meeting
of South Melbourne ratepayers the other day to
protest against the local council’s determination to
spend £5OO on a jag in honor of the city’s jubilee.
South Melbourne has a public debt of nearly
£195,000. It should celebrate its jubilee in
humiliation and prayer.
N.S.W. People’s Reform League is said to
be so disgusted with Mr. Carruthers that it is
busily gathering funds to send a couple of
organisers to the country to organise against the
Government. Everything points to the conclu-
sion that when Joseph goes to the country next it
will be as the friend of the Labor Party.
Surely even the Carruthers Government
would not permit a syndicate to run steam inotor-
’busses through the streets of Sydney and suburbs in
competition with the State trams ? To say nothing
of the politically suicidal character of such an act, it
would also be murderous, with the proposed speed
of 30 miles an hour. The tram is a fixed quantity
so far as the rails are concerned—people are safe
when clear of the rails. But the motor-’busses
would be free to skim corners and dodge in and
out everywhere.
S.M. Herald, too, has gathered up its
skirts for a campaign against Socialism :
Perhaps, in the long' run, it does not matter very much
how others see us. We shall work out our own destiny.
But in the meanwhile the stigma of Socialism is bound to
affect our foreign credit.
The old “ pop-shop ” argument again. Australia,
in the eyes of the non-Australian press published
in Australia, has already lost its independence,
and must consider every move in the light of the
foreign creditor.
Melbourne Customs wrestled with a new
undesirable-immigrants problem recently. The
sailing vessel Men nock arrived with her articles
expired, which meant that every member of the
crew was entitled to his discharge. There was no
trouble over the mixed white crew; but there
were two negroes, besides, and if the captain dis-
charged them he would be liable to be fined for
landing prohibited immigrants ; while if he did n’t
discharge them, they had an action against him
under the Merchant Shipping Act—penalty, £5O
in each case. Finally, the negroes solved the
difficulty by deciding on re-shipping in the
Mennock.
The Queensland Register has some new
and entirely original information concerning the
political customs of New South Wales. It asserts
that, until Hogue put his foot down, it was usual
to give each N.S. Wales M.L.A. £lO at Christmas
time to spend in his electorate. Dismal Jimmy,
says the Register, does the spending himself
now, having discovered that last year the member
for Geebung Creek gave his tenner to the foreign
missions; that the member for Ti-tree Elat
knocked his little lot down in a wild tear; that
the man from Mopoke Gully paid his life assur-
ance premium with his bit; that another member
put his divvy into shares in Adams’ sweeps, and
so on.
“ Lak ” : If the post office
is under Federal control, why—
when I recently bought (in
Queensland) a couple of N.S.W.
stamps—did the Department
charge me 25 per cent, on the
4d. ? I’m a whooper for Federa-
tion, but its practical evolution is
wretchedly slow.
Sydney D.T. talks horse-
sense when it advises N.S. Wales
to “take a lesson from what
has been done in Canada,
to encourage rather than
to tax primary production.”
It is monstrous that the
primary producer should
have to hump his bulky
goods from one end of the
earth to the other before
he finds a market. Canada
teaches the lesson—put on
heavy Customs duties, bring
in a host of consumers, give
the farmer a local market, and
so save him all this unnecessary
and expensive dragging of wheat
and dead cow across the earth.
That decent political dunderhead, David
Storey, tells the people of Rand wick (N.S.W.)
that he has discovered a great secret —that the
philosopher’s stone of government is to Let the
People Alone. Mr. Storey is a little late in
arriving at his conclusion—the doctrine of laissez-
faire is nearly a century old in its revival, and
dates originally back to Aristotle. But when Mr.
Storey’s further remarks are studied, it will be
found that his scheme does not mean really that
the people should be let alone, but that the mono-
polists, sweaters and boodlers should not be
interfered with.
S.M. Herald says, concerning the mail
contract—“lt is hardly consistent in those who
want white labor to be unwilling to pay for it.”
This, in spite of the fact that Orient manager
Anderson has said that the cost of labor has
nothing to do with the matter, and that his co.
wants the higher figure simply because the busi-
ness hasn’t paid. As a matter of fact, black labor
doesn’t seem to be cheaper than white on the mail
boats. Its recommendation is that it is more
servile. The mail lines which serve Australia
serve also India, and the Nabob passenger from
India with the curry-colored face and the hob-
nailed liver, likes servile surroundings.
There seems to be a little coolness between
the Argus and Private Enterprise just now ; so
the paper is saying things like this :
The value of the sites in the centre of the city nd in its
chief thoroughfares is greatly increased by their position
and those who reap this unearned increment ought to be
prepared to accept the responsibility and expense whioh
the occupying of such a site entails. The general appear-
ance of the city cannot be allowed to be ruined by the
greed of individual occupiers who desire either to erect
mean and unworthy buildings, or, on the other hand, to
advertise themselves by pretentiousness and vulgarity.
“Unearned increment”! Then what has the
Argus to say about a land tax, which would get
back for the people some of their own ?
Another instance of the Tory’s anxiety to
let the State run the non-dividend-paying con-
cern comes from south-west Victoria. Under
private enterprise Kenilworth has left a trail of
broken hopes and fortunes behind it. Now there
is great booming to foist it on to the State for
closer settlement. And when the estate (which
lies between Hamilton and Horsham, and only
reaches civilisation occasionally per bullock-wag-
gon) has proved a failure under closer settlement,
the Tory will point with great solemnity to another
State failure. But good estates, that will pay
handsomely under any management, are held
securely for private enterprise to prosper upon.
Thus the Argus on Russia’s “Red
Sunday”
They (the people) were simply seeking to make their
wishes known in a peaceful manner to the head of the
State. What is to be thought of the strength or self-
confidence of a Government which cannot control an un-
armed crowd without pouring volleys of bullets into it ?
Yet what did this Argus say when a Victorian
Government planted in the Melbourne morgue-
yard Tom Price and some hundreds of mounted
riflemen, provided with ball cartridges, awaiting
the peaceful crowd which assembled in Flinders
Park to express an opinion on the maritime strike ?
Like the hypocrite-papers that Russell-Lowell
placarded, the Argus “believes in freedom’s
laws—as far away as Paris is.”
“ War E.,” on the way they settle people
on the land in N.S.W. :
The Ganmain “Forest” Reserve case has advanced
another stage ; the Wagga Land Board has recommended
the application of the Scottish-Australian Investment 00.
to lease nearly 13,000 acres. All this land is within five
or six miles of Ganmain railway station, on the non-pay-
ing S.W. line. It’s in the belt of the finest wheat-growing
land in N.S.W., and doesn’t carry timber good enough to
build a goat-bail. Even granting the possibility of timber
on it within the next 30 years, the question is whether it
would not pay the State better to establish, say, 20 homes
on the alleged timber reserve, rather than lock up agri-
cultural land for 28 years, leasing it to a foreign “ shindy -
kat ”at sd. per acre ? The Board’s decision now goes to
the Minister for Lands, and N.S.W. will await with
interest Mr. Ashton’s verdict whether it’s better to raise
pine or men.
“ F.H.R.” : Barrenjoey Carruthers might
see if he can’t economise in the N.S.W Forest. De-
partment. Rangers may do good in some districts,
where piles are being cut, but why are three of
them kept in the Dubbo district ? Sleeper chop-
pers work there, and they won’t cut a young tree
for sleepers, because they would not be passed.
The fees the rangers collect do not nearly pay
salary and expenses, which are heavy.
Wolfe’s Schnapps as good for women as
for men. Buy bottles with wrappers intact. Get
what has been known for 70 years. Don’t be
deceived. Get Wolfe’s Schnapps.*

MALTHOID
“If it is not seemly , do it not ;
If it is not true, speak it not."l
—Marcus Aurelius.
AS SAFE AS fl HOUSE
is an old-fashioned saying that has passed muster these
many years. But it is not true as regards present-day
conditions; for a house is not safe unless protected from
damp by a thoroughly reliable and permanent Dampcourse.
MALTHOID Dampcourse used in the foundations,
over window and door openings, under window-sills and
parapets, is a perfect protection from the evil effects
of Damp. It would be more true to say—As safe as a
house with
Malthoid Dampcourse
~ N°t the same as others.-

The Coal-Pit Horse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GETTING the horse into the cage for the
pit is the first difficulty. He is first
blindfolded some distance away from the
shaft fence. Sometimes the horse gets suspicious,
and there is a bolt. Ultimately, by force or moral
suasion, the horse’s feet are planted on the wet
bridge of a horrible greasy swaying thing; the
cage-doors are slung on and bolted, and “ Horse
in cage” is rapped down. “ All clear ” rings out
the pit-top hammer, and the startled brute is
shivering at the cold pit-bottom before he has
time to think of kicking, even if that were possible
in a ten-man cage.
Some horses buck into the swing of pit life from
the jump; others, more imaginative, conjure up
dread visions from the darkness, and will not
budge till an old horse takes lead with the first
set. Often for weeks and weelcs the wheeler must
trudge on ahead with the light. Sometimes a
poor brute takes fright and blinds himself against
a prop; the light of others’ lives go out from no
apparent cause. A blind horse, even if new to the
work, seldom gives trouble ; he generally has a
don’t-give-a-hang air. Bright meadow or dark
pit—it is all the same to him.
When the stables are below ground, regular
feeds, shorter time from stalls, and decreased
travelling would appear to counteract the lack of
a little sunshine. Yet you sometimes see a liigh-
spinted brute die after being kept down below a
week plain case of broken heart. Horses drawn
from mines, during the Newcastle colliers’ nine
months’ strike, stampeded to the darkest gullies
at the first flush of dawn, only returning to the old
feeding-grounds after sunset. A horse born below
ground gives the wheeler a lovely time breaking
him in. Once let him get away, and lie scampers
through and through the mine galleries till the
safeties burn dim.
Most old pit-horses are demons for tricks.
I hey can unfasten a tucker-tin or empty a bottle
without removing it from the nail. They will
fight like trapper boys to jump one another’s turn
for the cage at knock-off. Knew one that could
breast a skip into the cage as well as any man ;
one that ate tobacco and cigarettes; one that
chased with his mouth open everyone who couldn’t
talk ‘ wheeler ” to him ; and another that, instead
of breeching the skips down the incline, used to
place his feet on the rails and slide. 11 was
amusing to watch an old stager, pulling small coal
and ashes from the furnace, prick his ears as each
skip was coupled-up, and stand on his dignity if
the wheeler shoved on an. extra one. Then the
wheeler would pretend to uncouple by rattling
the chain on the last skip, whereupon the old boy
would throw himself into the collar quite
contented.

Expenses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SYDNEY newspaper-office has lately
been troubled over “expenses.” A re-
porter is not supposed to spend his own
money on fares, hotel-bills, and other charges
incurred whilst engaged in the work of the office.
He bills the proprietary for such out-goings. In the
case of the “ rounds-man ’’—who goes the rounds
of the police-stations, hospitals, fire-stations, and
so on, for news—some offices pay a fixed sum
weekly, say £l, for trams and cabs. That is
supposed to cover everything, and anything
saved is a legitimate perquisite. The ordinary
staff-member sent on an up-country trip is in-
structed to stay at a good hotel, and his expenses
are met by the office. The sub-editor usually
supervises expense-accounts, and is supposed to
look after the interests of the proprietary and of
the staff, calling attention to under-charging or
over-charging.
* * * *
. the palmy days of the Australian press,
10 to 20 years ago, expenses were allowed on
a generous scale. If a reporter went away
vvith a Minister of the Crown and did his
share of “shouting” when champagne was
bi (niched, the office paid without & murmur.
i^ n R P ee ’ a l’ a°ing to M.L. once, entertained
the Ministry at dinner—a very expensive dinner,
lhe Aug us didn’t question the item. The same
man for the same paper once went up-country
with a Minister of the Crown, commissioned to
get from him, somehow, certain information. He
got the news, but his expenses account was enor-
mous. It included one item, “Lost at 100, £40.”
lhe sub-editor boggled at that sum. “Really,
Mr. ——, is it fair to charge the office with that ?”
he asked. “ Well, you told me to get the
news, and I had to play 100 with the old man to
keep him sweet, and I lost.” “Supposing you
had won, blandly inquired the sub., “ would you
have paid your winnings into the office ? ” “ Oh,
certainly,” said the reporter, as he winked the
other eye. The sub-editor winked too, and the
account went through.
The serenely respectable Sydney Morning
Herald had an hilarious expenses incident once.
A reporter who had made up his mind to leave the
wu , • , ( '. en sent on a special mining inquiry.
When his bill of expenses came in it read some-
thing like this: —
Railway fare £3 5 4
Coach 4 0 0
Monday, present to lady.’. " " 010 n
Hotel bill (four days) 1 10 0
Wednesday, present to lady .. 010 0
Incidentals 076
A shock of horror went through that moral office
when the bill reached the manager, and there was
sune discussion among various “heads” as to
whether the man ought not to be dismissed with-
out being called upon for an explanation. “ There
is not the slightest doubt as to its meaning ” said
one official gravely. “He glories in his miscon-
duct, and has the effrontery to bring the records
of it within the portals of the Sydney Morning
Herald office.” And he breathed as heavily
as it he had just run from viewing the dese-
cration of the Holy Sepulchre. Finally it was
decided to sentence the criminal .to be cast from
the Herald, to gnash his teeth in the outer dark-
ness, after an exhortation from the heavy-weight
exhorter of the office.
“Sir, your scandalous offence has shocked
me deeply began the official when the un-
abashed delinquent faced him, and ten minutes
of scathing eloquence followed. The reporter
professed am izament. What had he done ’ He
was conscious of no offence. The official reluc-
tantly c. me down from the heights of his moral
i i(.agnation to point a scandalised, tremulous
pencil at the item—-
Present to lady .. .. 10 0
“Oh, that s all right,” remarked the reporter
cherubically. “ You see, the mine was closed-
clown, arid the caretaker’s wife was in charge I
had to give her a tip to open up the mine the* two
days ! examined it. What did you think it was
sir.' -No explanation was tendered as to what
he thought. The reporter was, as he expected
asked to resign. ’
Nowadays, expense-accounts are very closely
checked. I here is no chance of charging-up
champagne to the oftioe. Indeed, a reporter who
ruined a suit of clothes, doing a wreck for a daily
paper, was only allowed the cost of a new suit
after some haggling. Which recalls a Sydney
Pf IL J Telegraph joke. A fledgling reporter had
joined the staff, and was persuaded by a humorist
that, since the office required its representative to
attend some functions in evening dress, a dress-
suit was looked upon as a sort of uniform, and
was provided by the proprietary. “ All you need
to do is to go to your tailor, order a suit, and
charge it to the office.” The victim did so, and
had a rough five minutes with the accountant in
consequence.
One great daily has lately come down to the
point of instructing its special representatives “to
stay at boarding-houses when possible, as they
are less expensive.” J

Nervous Headache.
Throbbing, Racking Pain in thh Temples
Cured bt Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
They Get at the Cause.
That excruciating pain in the top of the head,
a burning sensation and feeling as if a weight
was pressing upon your brain, is generally caused
by the inaction of the kidneys. The biood is over-
charged with impurities which the kidneys fail to
filter. This tends to increase the temperature of
the blood, which, carried to the brain, has a serious
effect upon the nerves. The pulse beats harder
and faster, and every throb is like a sledge-
hammer, and your head is ready to burst. You
are prostrated. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
will afford you almost instant relief. They get to
work at the cause of the headache, and strengthen
the kidneys to double their energies. The urinary
organs, which have been clogged, are opened, and
the impurities pass freely from the body. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a permanent cure
for all diseases arising from a disordered condition
of the stomach, liver and kidneys. They purify
the blood and make it rich and red, and are a
positive cure for biliousness, indigestion, constipa-
tion, headaches, sallow complexion, piles, pimples,
boils and blotches, and for female ailments.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The most interesting sporting fixture of the
week was the Dunlop Motor Reliability Contest for the
Buchanan Cup, between Sydney and Melbourne. The
motor* left Sydney on Tuesday morning', in glorious
weather. Among the starters was Mrs. B. Thompson, of
South Australia, driving her own car, a Wolseley, a one-
cylindered 6-h.p. vehicle of the light order, weighing about
half a ton and costing £250. There was a fine assembly of cars,
and even the motor bicycles showed a bewildering variety.
Among them was one of local build, and called the Illawarra.
All the rest were foreign made. The lightest machines
were the Motosacoche, which looked very like an ordinary
bicycle of the roadster pattern with an engine fitted on.
They weighed 80 lbs., were of 1J horse-power and the
market value was put down as £45. The big motor cars
aroused intense interest. The big Darracq (French) cars
looked like line-of-battle ships, and so did the Decauvilles.
They seemed altogether too heavy, and the cars that
seemed the most road-worthy were two elegantly finished
Argyll*. They glided away almost noiselessly, while the
French cars made a fearful row. A weird looking little
machine was Mark Foy’s “ Flying Fox,” which, by the
way, was the first motor car to accomplish the journey
between the two capitals. It was a 7h.p. Pan hard, and
was covered with honorable scars. The French cars were
all more costly than their English and American rivals.
The big Decauville and Darracq cars cost £750; the
Argylls £495 ; and the cheapest of the heavy class cars
was a £3OO Oldsmobile.
The first day’s run was from Sydney to Goul-
burn, a distance of 129 miles, over roads styled second and
first-class. The quickest time made by the motor-cycles
was that of B. James on a Minerva. V. H. Gard was next
on a Brown, and the locally-built Illawarra was close up.
The light cars were led in by Kellow on a Talbot; a
Da Dion, a Swift, and an Oldsmobile scored equal points.
In the heavy class the only cars which did not score the
full 500 points were Mark Foy’s Flying Fox (a Panhard), a
Talbot, and another Talbot. The fastest time was made by
Victorian Yankee Stevens in a huge Darracq. He went for
speed and got over the 129 miles in shr. 45mm. The second
day’s run of 121 miles was over more severe roads, and
only three motor bikes scored the 500 points —the Illa-
warra, a Minerva, and a Brown. Four light cars (Olds-
mobile, Swift, and two De Dions) scored full 600. Among
the heavy ears Langford’s Darracq was wrecked, and
Rand’s Decauville went bung. The other failures were
Foy’s Flying Fox, Nicholls’ Darracq, and Holmes’ Olds-
mobile. The 121 miles between Gundagai and Albury
proved bad for the motor bikes, only James and Gard on
the Minerva and Brown machines getting full score. The
same four light cars got through, and six Talbot,
the two Argylls, two Darracqs, and a Decauville —made
top score. The run from Gundagai to Albury had proved
the crisis of the journey. From Albury to Euroa they all
picked up again, and full points were scored by the nine
heavy cars left in, and five of the eight light cars that
were still going, while three motor-cycles failed to score.
Langford’s Darracq was progressing quietly behind the
tail of a despised moke en route for a railway station.
From start to finish, H. Li. Stevens in his big
Darracq had thundered in the very front. He ran oyer
everything—plunging through watercourses, jumping
logs, and flying at break-neck speed where others crawled.
His actual time for the whole journey was 23 hours 42sec.,
and his average speed 24 l-7th miles per hour. Behind
him were the two Argylls, driven by Messrs. Tarrant and
Ross, who had averaged 17 7-Bth and 17J miles per hour
respectively. Sydney Stott in his Decauville made 16J
miles per hour for the whole journey. These four
cars were the only ones which scored the possible
2500 marks. The best light cars were Mr. Coleman’s
Swift (14J miles per hour) and Messrs. Day and Craven’s
De Dions, which made 15J and 14J miles per hour respec-
tively for the trip. The breakdown in the motor-bikes
was very complete, Card’s Brown and B. James’ Minerva
being the only ones to score the possible. They made an
average speed of 19J and 20 3-sth miles per hour for
the whole trip. Mrs. Thompson, the lady who drove her
own oar, was right out of it; still she did better than
many of the men, having scored 1982 points out of the
possible 2500.
The final run-off to decide the destination of
the trophies will take place between Melbourne and
Ballarat, on a day to be fixed. The winners in every
class are Victorians.

Just now there is in Melbourne a “world-
girdling motorist ” —Charles J. Gliddon. He is travelling
round the world in the Arctic Circle, 24 h.p. Napier. He
crossed Canada on the rails of the C.P. line, having special
flanged wheels fitted to his car for the purpose. He is
using ordinary pneumatic Dunlops for the rest of his
journey. #
The numerousness and cheerfulness of the crowd
at Caulfield last Saturday promised a good send-off for
the V.R.C. Autumn Meeting, when the truth, or other-
wise, of Caulfield “form” will be tested in the New-
market Handicap. Probably the winner of the popular
sprint has been seen among recent battlers; neverthe-
less, the race looks more open than in many previous
years. Gladsome, Abington, Medallist, and (in a lesser
degree) Bullion are worth backing on their late public
trials, whilst Playaway, Haloya, and Lachlan, a
dark stable companion of Bullion, have a threaten-
ing appearance. Also “ the field ” is a notoriously
dangerous horse. Last year Old Mairp, a 25 to I chance,
beat the favorites. This time a turn-up for the books is
not so likely as a close struggle between two or three of
the well-backed ones, with two or three other public fanoies
following them home. Gladsome given a favorable runnutsf
go near to victory if she doesn’t actually win. On paper
the flying mare looks better able to give 21 lbs. to Bullion
than 18 lbs. to Abington, or 36 lbs. to Medallist. The ques-
tion whether any reasonable weight can stop Gladsome is
answered in a cocksure negative by her warm admirers,
yet the “ Racing Chronicle ” laughs at their enthusiasm ;
9st. 71b. is the highest weight ever humped by a New-
market winner thus far, and this is 101 b. less than Glad-
some’s burden. Between Abington and Medallist there is
little to choose ; Haloya, spoken of as a good thing, is not
a highly-proved performer ; Lachlan, the unknown, has
the advantage and disadvantage of a light weight (7st.),
which means a very small jockey for so large a colt;
Playaway is open to the objections that she failed last
year, when punters laid even money on her, and is not an
up-to-date “star” like Gladsome, Abington, or even
All the same, this ecribe likes Playaway. She
carries only 4lb. more than the weic-ht with which she
was placed third last year. Assum.ng her to have im-
proved with age, her chance is undeniable. Playaway
may beat Medallist, Gladsome and Abington.
'• * • *
The Australian Cup, at time of writing, appears
to be at the meroy of the 3-year-old division, notwith-
standing Lamrock, Green Mountain, Bright Beauty, Elvo,
Merrion, Emir, and other seasoned horses. Blinker, if he
has been prepared for the 2J miles, should beat Billings-
gate and Dividend, though the latter is much respected
for the workmanlike way in which he outstayed Canteen
last week. Emir’s chance of carrying 9.7 in front of
the young and old opposition may be judged from
his running in a w.f.a. race on Saturday. As regards
his temperament, Emir is the same beast now as
heretofore, but it must be remembered that he galloped
beautifully at Flemington 12 months ago, when even
Lord Cardigan couldn’t trouble him. In a field of com-
parative commoners Emir must always be as dangerous
as he is untrustworthy. The big son of Wallace and
Emmie performed in an absurdly “off-and-on” style
behind Gladsome when that honest mare was getting
away with the Futurity Stakes. First ho wouldn't, and
then he would gallop, and when he did choose to go he
travelled faster than any of them, not excepting the
winner.

Well-known N.S.W. squatter and sport, Mr.
H. C. White, died at Hobart on Friday night of internal
cancer, aged about 70. Mr. White was breeding horses
on the Castlereagh 46 years ago, and owned at the time
of his death one of the best studs in Australia, built up
principally by well-judged importations. His first big
venture in connection with breeding racehorses was the
purchase, 24 years ago, of famous English mare Valetta
and three of her female progeny for £lOOO. Paris (winner
ef two successive Caulfield Cups and Doncaster Handicap)
and Bungebah (Newmarket winner) were of Valetta
descent, and bred by Mr. White, who was a younger
brother of the late Mr. James White.

A commission for Gladsome was foreshadowed
in the minds of suspicious observers when Melbourne
Argus made the announcement that Sol Green’s cham-
pion would be a non-starter for the Newmarket if her
stable-companion, Independence, continued to go well on
the track. Last Thursday morning Independence did a
first-class gallop as evidence that she was keeping
well,” nevertheless the other mare was backed later in
the day for all the money in the market. The Argus
evidently had been used for the dissemination of a bogus
“ warning.” . * ♦

Phil Newland was married in Adelaide last
week, and has gone off to overtake the Australian XI. in
Maoriland. Joe Darling, who sails to London direct, has
another month before starting, and goes on quietly look-
ing after his Adelaide sports-outfit business. His latest
innings was a level 100 in electorate cricket.
If no more interest is shown in champion
athletes Shrubb and Duffey in other capitals than in
Melbourne their visit will not be a success financially.
Last Saturday’s attendance on the M.C.O. outer ground
would scarcely pay for advertising, while the reserves
were but a quarter filled, mostly with dead-heads.
Duffey is still unable to strike the form he is supposed to
possess, losing his heat in the 100 yd. handicap to Morgan,
of Essendon, on 4Jyd., and though the judges gave him
the verdict in the 100 Invitation Handicap, it was a
doubtful honor, many feeling certain that Shea,
2£yd., was first, with Mueller, Widmer (N.S.W.), and
Duffey himself disputing the other places. Shrubb started
in the Open Mile, and though he won by 20yd. from Blake,
didn’t attempt anything sensational, and the Austra-
lasian amateur record of 4.25, held by J. F. Dalrymple,
still holds good, though he chipped 12-5 sec. off the Vic-
torian record of 4.804-5. In the 4-mile—giving, among
others, Blake 160yds. and a hefty youngster, C. J. Fraser,
of Malvern, 500yds.—he tackled the Victorian records of
4.304-5, 10.5 4-6,15.30 and 21min., and lowered the three
last to 9.47 4-5,14.58 4-5 and 20.15 2-5, winning, with a fine
■print, by half a lap from Blake. Writer has doubts about
Duffey, but he would like to see Shrubb extended. He fills
the eye as a runner. Moving like a machine, the thin, brown,
wiry figure paces round. Ashe passes, j r ou notice the wide,
deep chest, the well-set head, and square jaw ; then the
wide hipkand good thighs strike the eye, though the legs
are thin and the stride seems a trifle short. By the way,
the local runners make tremendous fuss over themselves.
They canter a quarter in 53 or 54, touch the tape, then
collapse and lie on the grass for a space while someone
rubs and fans them strenuously. Shrubb broke a 4-nule
record, and then walked easily to the pavilion, and writer
has, at Lillie Bridge, seen little L. E. Myers do his quarter
in 49see., and W. G. George his record mile, and then
stroll to the dressing-room as though nothing unusual
had occurred.
■•* • *
Strange what a lot of people affect to dis-
believe that Duffey ever put up that 9 3-ssec., and charac-
terise it as a “Yankee lie.” But considering that Duffey
has repeatedly done the same distance in 9 4-ssec., and
about ten others share the time with him, and that once
he did it on grass, there is nothing remarkable about him
dropping. l-sth of a second on a first-class track, such
as one would expect them to have in a city like New York.
* * * *
When the distinguished British and Yankee
runners arrive in Sydney it is just possible that
they will meet foemen more worthy of their
legs. Sydney has taken the matter very seriously,
and been hard at work trying to undo the evil
perpetrated by the cronk flat-racers who have ruined
the game. For weeks a number of very speedy dark
horses have been undergoing a course of special training,
A. A. CAMERON, a Scottish athlete now in
M.L., who has challenged Hackenschmidt to
a wrestling match.
and it is said that some hair-raising times have been made
by two short and a pair of long-distance men. One thing
is certain—that if this State puts its ears right hack
and seriously gets its head down to bringing out some
runners who will race Duffey and Shrubb very close, it
can do it. We’ve produced some champions in the past,
and our great athletic resources are not played out yet.
A 20-year-old son of ancient M.L. athletic
champion Bill Burk wants to toe the mark for a mile run
with Englishman Shrubb when latter visits Dunedin.
T’other day, Burk ran a half-mile against the wind in
2min. 3sec. Coming out 30min. later, and under adverse
conditions, he loped over the mile in 4min. 35 2-ssec. The
Horsham wonder’s best time is 4min. 22sec., and the
young Maorilander can do it in something under 4min.
30sec.

“Alex. M.”: If I didn’t know that “Alba”
(8., 16/2/’O5) frequently writes at raw-random, I should
“laugh consumedly” at his dogfulness. He is right
about the bull-terrier being the prince of fighters, by
reason of his quickness and of the “ punishing ” length of
jaw which has been evolved in him by selection in
breeding; but, all the same, if the pure “bull” gets
an effective hold, it’s long odds against the other
tyke. Then, as to that “ huge kangaroo-dog ” affair,
“ Alba ” should know that for anything like a
“ fair go,” dogs are matched carefully by weight
—a difference of, say, 351 b. against 401 b. being almost pro-
hibitory. Therefore 301 b. against 60 or 70 could, bar
accidents, end only one way. Further, if a “ bull ” gets a
hold on a kangaroo-dog that allows the latter free use of
his teeth, the former will hold on till he is practically cut
to pieces by the other’s slaughtering snap-bites. 1 once
saw a bulldog thus killed by a large and savage
greyhound. The “bull” had got a breast-hold, and
suffered himself to be slashed to ribbons by the grey-
hound’s trenchant snaps. He died, on the hold, from
sheer loss of blood ; but not before he had “ worked-in ”
almost to his antagonist’s heart; said antagonist also ex-
piring half-an-hour later. Again, a dog that is a cocktail
at bottom may fight splendidly as long as he’s getting the
best of it; but I have known a battle won by the mangled
remnant that crawled indomitably up to “ scratch ” after
a two hours Struggle, from an opponent that then put hie
tail down and fled the pit. And, finally, there is no
authenticated instance of absolutely pure bull-blood
showing the our. When that happens there is always
strong suspicion of a “ throw-back ” to a non-bull strain.
When Dick Cavill carried his cargo of ginger-
beer and peanuts over 300yds. in 3min. 34 3-ssec. at Liver-
pool Baths, on September 27th, 1902, and thereby
smashed through his own world record by 6 l-ssec., and
left Lane’s record an additional 2-sths behind, the
swimming world wondered. It was considered a mar-
vellous performance, but of late Sydney has seen so many
world’s records go to pieces that when B. B. Reran did
the same distance in 3min. 31 4-ssec. in Farmer’s Domain
Bath, Sydney, on Saturday, nobody was a bit surprised.
The laps were 45yds. Ift., and it took Dick Cavill 3min.
40 4-ssec. to cover the same distance in the self-same
bath when he broke the then world’s record on Feb.
23rd, 1901.

Not to be outdone by women long-distance swi ai-
mers of Victoria and Queensland, Miss Massey, daughter
of a Claremont (W.A.) bath proprietor, recently swam
from Claremont jetty to Point Walter jetty and back
(4 miles) in 3hr. lmin. Miss Massey expects to do a lot
better next time she tackles the task.

The running of Ellegaard is a thing which even
the Dane himself does not understand. Like the wrath of
Heaven, the ability to suddenly dash off at top speed, to
jump from dead slow to somewhere about 20 miles an
hour all in a twirl of the pedals, falls on him without
warning. Sometimes it falls on him at the wrong part of
the race, and then he dashes away only to be overtaken
and beaten horribly—for it never falls on him twice in the
same race. However, it struck him at the right moment
in the team races between himself and Rutt on the one
part, and Farley and Ivor Lawson on the other part. The
’Murkan world champion won the first mile, but the
second, third, fourth and fifth were won by the Dane in a
most decisive manner. Neither Lawson nor Farley got a
look in.
The apparent honesty of the man-to-man test
racing on Melbourne Exhibition track last week compen-
sated in a measure for its slowness. Ellegaard crawled
for } mile, with Farley crawling behind him, or vice verm,
and then they sprinted home, the Dane proving himself the
better tactician, or the better sprinter. Anyway, he won
two successive heats. Lawson and Rutt likewise crawled
and sprinted, the American’s two wins being more dis-
tinctly masterful than Ellegaard s. Had the men raced
all the way in every heat, one of the results might have
been different, and the public would certainly have got
more fun for its money ; but if they were all doing their
best to beat one another the public cannot complain.
Honest wheel-racing between two men, neither of whom
can “donkey lick” the other, is the very antithesis of
boat-racing. In the one case the early pacer gains an
advantage, in the other case he gives it to his opponent.
A champion sculler can win all the way, like a champion
foot-racer ; hut a champion cyclist can’t win all the way
if the way is any considerable distance. If he cannot afford
to make the pace from the jump, is it likely that an
honest solitary opponent will attempt the impossible.
Bike-racing- lacks the warlike spirit of other manly sports.

N.S.W. League of Wheelmen last week threw
out Larry Corbett’s appeal for whitewash, not on the
jrrounds that he must obey the League s ruling 1 as to the
disposal of last year’s Sydney Thousand prize before any
appeal can be considered, but because it was in his
brother’s handwriting. When Larry comes back he is
going to appeal personally. Stated on good authority
that the voting of the Council will be the same as m the
MacFarland case. They’re generous with the whitewash
in Sydney.

The handicaps for the Sydney Thousand are
out, and the cycling scribes are already writing “ the
winner will almost certainly be found among the follow-
ing ” After the curious capers which were indulged in
at" last Sydney Thousand, the tipsters have got more
courage than sense. The Bulletin’s financial editor has
been asked to give our tip for the race.

Said that Stanbury will meet Towns next week
over a friendly cup of tea to arrange the date for their
race. Stanbury is getting down the flesh somewhat,
having reduced his weight to somewhere about 1.5 stone
—and a great struggle it has been. _ Possible Stanbury
will have an even bigger contract in putting up the
money than in gettingjiown the fat.
Dull and warm, with a faint nor’easter, Satur-
day afternoon found Sydney Harbor crowded with racing
craft, no less than seven events being almost simul-
taneously contested. The grey-blue water was flecked
everywhere with white sails. The yachts of the Prince
Alfred Club were racing for the Marshall Plate, a trophy
which has to be won four times by an ownerin his own yacht
to become his permanent possession. This was the second
race for it, and last year it was won by one Brookhoff in
the Fleetwing. Fleetwing was present to get in a second
leg if possible, and started with a 1 min. handicap, and
five ahead of her, the limit boat receiving as much as
25min. After a first class and well contested race, A. E.
Muston’s Janet, a 3min. boat, got home first, with
the Sunbeam from scratch second and Magic, another
3 minuter, third. Last year’s winner was a long way out
of it.

Sydney Sailing Club’s handicap on Saturday as
a race was anything, but exciting. Desdemona, with a
10 minutes handicap, got a good start, with only two
beside her and the same number ahead of her, and had an
easy win. The feature of the race was the masterly way
Chris. Webb saved the Australian from a capsize and
luffed clean out of danger and, incidentally, of all hope of
winning the race.

As suggested herein recently, when it was
announced that Turner and Jessop would have to box
till one proved superior, there was no difficult}' in picking
the winner. Both men were just as well as ever, and
displayed the same amount of skill and caution as usual,
but even in the second round Turner showed that he was
the better, and gave the Newcastle man a lot more than
that pug could return. From that on Turner led on
points, but after the 15th round it became evident that
Jessop was hopelessly beaten. He would not use his
right, the one on which he had relied all through the
battle, and after the scrap it was found that he had
broken it. The eternal Turner-Jessop draw grew
very wearisome ; five referees had declared that they
could not decide which was the winner. It was a most
profitable hit of inability for the bruisers, and now it has
come to an end.

Much-boomed S’African heavy-weight, Pat
Farley, came a cropper in Melbourne last week at hands
of welter pug., Ed. Williams, thrice beaten by Jack Black-
more in Sydney. Farley’s ways suited Williams nicely,
and he was punched out half through the first round. A
week before succumbing to Williams, Farley challenged
the winner of the Moir-Felix fight for £lOO aside. Lucky
for Farley, Moir didn’t take up the gage. Williams will
make some of the best sit up if he is given plenty of fight.

“ Fedder” boxing champion Ted Murphy, in
defeating Victorian Sam Nathan at Sydney National S.C.
last week, demonstrated one or two things he had not
previously been credited with—he punched hard enough
to badly fracture a couple of his opponent’s ribs, and
out-generalled a much older and considerably more
•xperienced boxer. Murphy is a quiet youngster (cer-
tainly not moreithan 18), with a good-looking face.


= BOILS
And Ulcerated Sores
BOILS, which are a very common
affliction at this season of the year,
may arise from a debilitated con-
dition of the system, and generally occur
on some part of the body exposed to fric-
tion or chafing. After the boil has burst
the healing process will be greatly aided
by the repeated application of Zam-Buk.
As a striking illustration, Mr. John
Handy, of 380 Campbell-street, Rock-
hampton, Q., says : —“I have used Zam-
Buk Healing Balm for boils and ulcerated
sores and find it a far superior article to
various other ointments I have tried. A
few applications of Zam-Buk
brought about a perfect cure,
where other ailments have
entirely failed. lam in the
employ of the Railway De-
partment, Rockhampton, and
have no hesitation in recom-
mending Zam-Buk as an in-
valuable healing balm.”

ZAM-BUK, the Great Healer, is a SPEEDY CURE for PILES, ECZEMA,
BOILS, RUNNING SORES, SORE LEGS, RINGWORM, BARCOO, etc. As an
EMBROCATION for STRAINED MUSCLES and TENDONS, ZAM-BUK, rubbed
veil into the parts affected, is unequalled. As a HOUSEHOLD BALM for CUTS,
BURNS, BRUISES, PIMPLES, BLACKHEADS, PRICKLY HEAT, FRECKLES,
SUNBURN, RASH, and BITES of INSECTS, ZAM-BUK is invaluable. From all

A witness before the Tariff Commission
showed that Freetrade (?) Britain pays a bounty
on exported spirits, and produced “ Ridley on the
British Tariff ” (1903) to prove that excise duty on
exported spirits was repaid, plus 3d. and sd. per
gallon ! It is this bounty-fed competition which
has killed the Australian industry.
T. Bent’s faithful colleagues never miss an
opportunity of cracking-up that immense man—
indeed, several of them seem to exist for no other
purpose. At South Melbourne, the other night,
Cameron and M'Leod, Ministers of Works and
Mines, relieved a municipal banquet with frantic
eulogiums of the abounding Bent, reminding the
suburb that it had once refused Tommy, the
Cabbage King, with such scorn that the £5O de-
posit of this “wonderful, straight-forward, and
genuinely honest man ” was commandeered by the
State. “But,” declared M‘Leod, in a rhapsody,
“like the late Lord Beaconsfield, Mr. Bent’s time
has come, and now South Melbourne must hear
him. ” Cameron went even further, and beslavered
Bent so free'y that even the fatmen present began
to feel ill. This kind of thing reminds one very
forcibly of the parasites in the proverb that
pleaded so eloquently for the life of the unwhole-
some dog.
R. G. Wilson and Co., grocers, of Mel-
bourne, write re par. on tea prices (8., 23/2/’O5),

letin should publish the fact. We do so.
The result of the inquiry into the affair-
Wodonga is satisfactory to all but the genera!
public. About Christmas time the Wodong;,
going down Port Phillip, was scared nearly to
death by a shell from one of the Bay forts passing-
through her r igging. The gunners, when remo.i-
strated with, called the people on board clumsy
liars. The vessel was half a mile from the line of
fire, and to say that one of their shots went in her
direction was nothing but a studied insult. The
collective testimony of passengers and crew was
too strong, and the inquiry ordered in conse-
quence discovered that the shot, aimed with
uncommon accuracy, had struck the stanchion of
the target, and must have thence ricocheted over
(luckily, not through) the Wodonga. The soldiers
are hugely delighted at this testimonial to their
professional skill, and the sailors are pleased to
prove that they were not spinning sensational
yarns. The travelling public, finding themselves
not safe, even when the gunners fire straight, will
have to hold their heads on pretty tight whenever
gun practice is going on. When Mr. Jack Want’s
yacht Miranda had her topmast shot away between
Sydney Heads, some years ago, he was the com-
mission of inquiry himself on that occasion, and
his finding was couched in fine, vigorous language.

Adelaide is a proud city to-day. There
was a tram accident last week. The S.A. horse
trams have never before been credited with such
capacity.
‘ ‘ Elmore ” : Met a white hawker, t’other
day. While the billy boiled, he talked. “Women
are the best to sell to ; the old ones much better
than the girls. If you see a cat or two sitting out
on the doorstep, you needn’t knock ; it’s a sure
sign the missus is not at home. Men are the worst
customers. If you get talking to a man, turn the
conversation on infectious diseases ; then you can
always sell him a bottle of disinfectant. A man is
in a great funk when there is fever about. The
cockies are no good this year. They had a good
harvest, so now they can sport a buggy and drive
into the towns to the storekeepers. Last year,
they had to turn to us. If ever you go hawking,
sonny, start in a small way. Blacken your face
and tie half-a-dozen towels round your head, and
you’ll soon raise a waggon and pair. Only about
one in six Hindu hawkers walk now.”
The growing Australian craze for rising up
to celebrate anything from a dog-fight downwards
is becoming serious. Advt. from D.T., 14/2/’O5 :
AFTER 5 0 YEARS.
To all Surviving Passengers to Sydney by the ship
Constitution, which sailed front Southampton on the
14th of February, 1855, the undersigned respectfully
invite communication with either of them with a view
to a proposal to celebrate the Jubilee of their arrival
at Sydney on the 27th May, 1855.
WILLIAM SAUNDERS, Caterer, Masonic Hall,
Sydney ; or to
WALTER GATES, Grocer, Church-st., Parramatta.
Fashion, once set, of celebrating your arrival in
this, that or t’other ship, 50 years ago, has vast
possibilities about it. Luckily, “historic” arrivals
prior to ’55 aren’t liable to enthuse on the subject
unduly.
“ Hamer ” tells how he and himself had a
very good time :
When I came home late, the other night or early the
other morning, I found I had a tremendous fund of won-
derfully funny stories to tell, and a splendid listener to
enjoy them. Then somebody told me to go to bed, and !
started to undress. My boots were hard to get off, so,
seeing the difficulty, I offered to drag them off, for which
I thanked myself very much. When I sat down and ex-
tended my leg I found I could not do much dragging, and
accused myself of beingdrunk ; to which I retorted, “You’re
drunk yourself,” and laughed when I saw the humor of the
situation, until again urgently requested to “go to bed.”
After that I kicked my boots off with a bang that made
somebody scream, which set me laughing afresh, and
made me apologise in a far-reaching voice for waking any-
body up. “Go to bed,” sternly said the same voices. I
explained to the one nearest me that I was going to bed,
and stated the causes of the delay, the time it would take
for me to get to sleep, and other details. Then I wan-
dered into general observations about the weather, and
started on an extremely funny story (which I forget);
this caused a lady to exclaim, “Oh ! ” ; and a man,
“ Shut up—go to bed.” This last expression got on my
nerves. It seemed I had a noble, poetic nature, which
was misunderstood. In melancholy vein I conjured up
love and other reminiscences, which I (the other I)
remembered. That relieved me of the impression of my
loneliness. I recollected that I had known myself for
some time, and found myself a trusty friend. “ You ’re
a good old boy,” I said, affectionately ; “ come and have
a drink.” “Go to bed,” said an urgent voice. “I’m
going,” I said, “ I’m going ; only he’s drunk ; we ’re
going to have another drink—join us.” The voice told us
to go—not to bed this time. I looked for the door, opened
it, and walked through the doorway. To my surprise I
tumbled into a bed. When thirst woke me I was lying
across my bed. Going out to the bathroom for a drink,
I found my hat on the stair-head, my boots and clothes
decorating various parts of the stairs, and my landlady in a
state of nearly speechless indignation regarding them.
“Who was that man you brought in with you last night?”
she said, severely. “Oh, a grand fellow,” I said ; “ one of
the best. The best friend I have in the world.” Some-
times I have doubts ; but probably I was right.

From Goombo Lodge, Peckham, London, S.E.,
They tell this story in Wellington, M.L.,
where the electric tram service is new and the cars
are chronically crowded. A well-known man,
who had got used to travelling in crowded cars,
was going home one night after a birthday cele-
bration. He was a lone passenger until a lady
boarded the car; then, rising and bowing grace-
fully, he said, “ Madam, you take my seat —I will
stand.” And he hung on to a strap for the rest of
the ride, beaming with whisky and politeness.
“Alba” : Many Australian writers have
broken their pens striving for the word that will
explain the great oneness of London’s chief smell
—London, the sepulchre of six million breaths.
It flows up from dank cellars and alleys in germ-
laden streams; it is the smell of a small, over-
crowded bedroom. Listen a moment, and you
will hear the Englishman coughing in the midst of
it. At midnight, in winter, the cough is loudest
—up in the garrets, in waiting-rooms, and in the
recesses of wet and mouldy arches. The London
smell and the London cough are almost as deadly
as the London sneeze. If some enterprising syn-
dicate of electricians could harness the jolts from
each individual sneeze, there would be enough
power generated to illuminate the Strand. The
criminal waste of London's sneeze-power is quite
overlooked by modern scientific writers.
“Ku Klux ”: We have a family of
Smiths in our street, and about once a week
they have a row that reminds me of Sheol or
Mafeking day. Then the neighborhood gathers
together, and the word goes round: “The
Smiths are at it agen.” The women look at
each other and say, “Shocking!” “Dreadful!”
“ Scand’less ! ” but they listen with all their ears
to the compromising family disclosures made
during a Smith row. Occasionally the police
intervene—to everybody’s disappointment. They
arrived the other day just when Mrs. Smith
was pursuing Smith into the street with a
kettle of hot water. After the gathering had
departed to escort Mrs. Smith to the lock-up,
I heard a man ask Smith’s son what started it.
“Well,” said the lad, “dad got a ticket in
Tatt.’s. ’E ain’t got any result yet, but he
reckoned ’e’d get first ’orse, and ’e said ’e’d take
a trip to the old country ; and when mother arst
’im if ’e’d go without her, ’e said ‘ Wot in ’ell would
I take you for ? ’ An’ the nex’ thing I knoo the
sugar-basin ’it me on the bloomin’ lug. Mother
never could aim straight.”
“ Mars ” writes :
Re “F.J.B.’s” article (2/2/’O5). Educational faddism
began to run rampant over Australia about a decade ago.
South Australia started first. Then in Victoria there was
a sort of blind groping. Afterwards the chaos was
organised into a definite programme by that whale for
theory and mental development, Director F. Tate, at the
head of several imported educationalists. The old result
system, which considered a child an expansible bladder
to be stuffed with odd and sundry facts, was superseded
by a new system. This system was built upon the theory
that it is better to teach a child to use his natural faculties
for himself than fill him with facts without the power of
using them. For instance, Nature-study does not attempt
to teach biology or botany, but to train children in the
use of their eyes, &c. Drawing, brush work and manual
training do not teach painting or carpentry, but manual
dexterity, &c., and so on. These subjects win their place
if they develop these qualities, though they do no prac-
tical good. So much for the theory, which is beautiful.
But, the subjects are so many, and the special skill re-
quired to get the most good out of them so great, that
much of the good is lost. Only a few T , comparatively, of
the most enlightened teachers have grasped the spirit of
the new work, and so the old cram system is continued,
but with new subjects. It takes an educated brain of no
mean calibre to get order out of all this jumble, and
where is Victoria going to get such for the £ll2 10s. to
£165 per annum that rewards the rank and file of the
teachers ?
This is a startling allegation that comes so
late—that there is no record of the baptism of the
late Queen Victoria, and that it is quite probable
she was not christened at all. Reason, her
parents could not afford the costly splash neces-
sary for a royal infant. The parents of the late
Queen were so poor that they would not have
been able to get to England in time to make her a
little English infant if it had not been that their de-
voted friend, Alderman Wood (grand-uncle of Mr.
Charles Stuart Parnell and of Field Marshal Sir
Evelyn Wood) advanced them money for the ex-
penses of the journey. The yarn comes from
Modkkn Society.
Kate Carew, the American caricaturist, who
is always mentioned as “ the only woman carica-
turist,” gives an interesting account of herself in a
current English maga. She is, it seems, the wife
of a younger brother of Haddon Chambers.

The Wedding Present
WHAT SHALL IT BE?
THE Wedding Present question turns up frequently in most people’s lives —too frequently for many,
probably. Still, it is a question that has to be faced. We have set ourselves the task of collecting, by
the help of our own experienced buyers in our own house in Loudon, a selection of reasonably-priced
articles, specially suited —on account of their usefulness and prettiness—as Wedding Gifts, and we men-
tion a few of the latest here. They are but examples of what we can do. If you call, we can show you scores
of others equally captiva-
ting. If you cannot call,
write for our Large Illus-
trated Catalogue. It’s Use-
ful —It’s FREE. (To the
superstitious we would say
. —No. 13 is the gem of the
collection.)

A CLOCK FOR THE
DINING-ROOM
WE have the very thing ; then others for the kitchen
and for the bedroom. England, France and America
have contributed their best, and never at any time in
Sydney has there been a collection of Handsome
Marble Clocks to compare with our present showing.
There is not a design amongst the whole display that
would not be an ornament and improvement to any
home. Our Strand windows are now very attractive
with these Beautiful Clocks—so various in design, so
reliable as timekeepers, and at such wonderfully low
prices, too. The fact is, we are catering for the
Clock trade on a large scale, and are making special
prices. An inspection invited.

OUR line of 275. 6d. Clocks is the best made. The
works (or movement, as we call it) are thoroughly
good in construction—the metals used being just
right in every way— so that long service, with
dependable time-keeping, can be relied upon. The
cases are of fine quality Polished Hardwoods—hand-
some for kitchen use—beautiful enough for the
dining-room. The tick-took of one of our Clocks will
while many an hour away when you are in the house
by yourself. It is wonderful the sense of security
that attends the tick-tock, tick-tock of a good clock.

SURELY an attractive combination, more especially
when the two are combined in the form of Hair and
Cloth Brushes, Hat Brushes, and Hand M'rrors.
Nowadays, when Silver-backed Brushes are got out in
the most shoddy manner by unscrupulous firms, who
aim to get a iittle temporary glory by apparently
quoting- very low prices, it is refreshing to be able to
fall back on such a substantial combination as good
Bristle, Ebony and Silver, at equally low prices. The
former is for show ; the latter for use. We stake our

engraved blade Butter Knives. On the same day we
got delivery of the sweetest little, fine-quality, silver-

the finish to the Afternoon Tea Table. If we asked
you to fix a value for one of these, you would cer-

7s. 6d. Larger sizes, 10s. 6d. We placed an order for
our Eight Stores for Two Thousand, and the makers
cannot turn out more than we buy, so that you waste

A HEALTHY LIVER— A HEALTHY LIFE
Professor F. H. Griffin,
M.D., wrote:
“ I only wish every soul in the world used
Kutnow’s Powder; they would experience
great benefit. Four of my family besides
myself use it regularly.” It is a splendid
corrective for liver disorders. It is as mild
as the purest water, but as certain as the
rising of the sun. It is delightfully refresh-
ing as a health-draught, and removes the
severest headache almost instanter.
Professor /. N. Love,
M.D,, wrote:
“ The great surgeon, Professor Lawson
Tait, M.D., himself a sufferer from a gouty
diathesis, was not only one of the world s
greatest surgeons, but an able physician and
a skilful therapeutist. For years he found
Kutnow’s Powder of great value to him per-
sonally and in his practice, and this remedy
is one of the few he conspicuously endorsed
over his own signature. He realised, as all
careful, observing practitioners do, that it is
necessary to cleanse the system frequently,
to remove the debris of undigested food, and
to hasten the elimination of uric acid to
properly guard against serious disease. Kut-
now’s Powder stimulates the activities of the
bowels and kidneys. A dessert-spoonful in
a tumblerful of water taken immediately on
rising in the morning cleans out the bowels,
acts as a diluent, and flushes out the kidneys
in a most satisfactory way. Thorough
elimination is salvation, and there is no
better eliminator than Kutnow’s Powder.”
Late Professor of Clinical Medical Diseases of Children
and Hygiene, Marion-Sims College of Medicine, and
College of Physicians and Surgeons.
How to Secure Both.
How many people are there to-day in the British Isles who could
answer the greeting—“ How are you?" by saying, “ Very well,
thanks ! ’’
The percentage who could truthfully say, “ Very well, thanks,”
is very small, but really (with care) everyone ought to be always well.
Good health is your birthright, but, unfortunately, you have an
organ to keep in order called the liver, an unruly member.
If you have a strong, active liver, you will lead a strong, active
life, but you must keep the liver up to the mark.
If you find a difficulty with the liver, be careful to avoid drugs,
mercurial pills, and all drastic remedies —they hurt.
Adopt Kutuow’s Ponder, the liver encouraging remedy ; it acts
gently, yet, nevertheless, does its work with extraordinary efficiency.
If you wish to excel in brain-work you will find a dessert-spoon-
ful of Kutnow’s Powder of immense benefit. The same applies to
every action of our daily life—work, play, sleep—no matter what
you do, if you would do it well you must keep the great organs of the
body in perfect working order. The stomach needs cleansing, the
liver stimulating, the kidneys flushing, and the bowels clearing.
Herein lies the whole secret of health, and Kutnow’s Powder does
this for you, and does it perfectly.
IMPORTANT CAUTION!
Kutnow’s Powder is sold everywhere, but should you be shown a bottle
similar to the genuine Kutnow's Powder, bear in mind that to be
genuine every bottle must have the fac-simile signature, “ S. Kutnow
and Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade-mark, “ Hirschensprung, or
Deer Leap,” on the carton and label on the bottle. This signature
and trade-mark alone ensure your obtaining the
Genuine KUTNOW’S POWDER
Dr. A. A. O’Neill, M.D.,
wrote :
“ Columbia Hospital, Chicago,
“June 10, 1904.
“It gives me pleasure to state with what
satisfaction I have used Kutnow’s Powder in
my practice. I find that it is one of the best
neutralisers, and at the same time a gentle
laxative and gastric sedative, which over-
comes the most distressing symptoms so
often remembered by patients with so much
dread. Given in small freshly made doses
every few minutes, it soon controls the
gastric distress, keeps up gentle peristalsis
and laxity, the importance of which surgeons
appreciate. “A. A. O’NEILL, M.D.”
Dr. W. R. Jones,
Professor of Medical Chemistry and Toxicology,
University College, Virginia, wrote :
“I am constantly prescribing Kutnow’s
Powder, with invariably good results. I also
use it myself in order to regulate the
inactivity of the digestive and excretory
organs. It is especially beneficial in stimu-
lating a sluggish liver, preventing biliousness
and dyspepsia, and permanently removing
the baneful effects of chronic constipation.”
Removes Liver Trouble.
“13, Acland Street, London E.,
“ August 4, 1904.
“Sirs, —I have tried many remedies for
liver complaints, but they have done me very
little good. After the second trial of Kut-
now’s Powder I felt immense relief, so I
cannot help giving your Powder a good word.
“J. KINGSLEY.”

We sell nearly three times as many Beale Australian Pianos in Australia as
are sold by any other maker, foreign or British.
We fought for and won our right to existence against extreme opposition by
foreign agents and those amongst musical “professors'’ who are their willing
satellites. All that in the teeth of freetrade, falsely so-called, which admitted
pianos free and placed duties on our materials.
There are seven times as many German Pianos imported as there are of
British and American added together. But only Pianos made in the climate are
fit to stand the climate.
Our name is on every instrument, whereas on imported pianos the names are
usually of unknown foreign makers or are wholly fictitious.
We sell direct from factory to user, and thus save you two or three heavy
loadings of profit besides freight, duty and charges.
Our prices are not more than half those of the leading makers in London
itself, and the Beale Pianos are in all respects demonstrably superior. Please
examine them and trust your own eyes, ears and intelligence.
If you send your money abroad you strengthen your commer ial and per-
haps your national enemies. If you spend it at home on an Australian piano
some of it must return to you, whilst your neighbours, anyhow, benefit. We dis-
tribute £9OO per week—say £45,000 per year —amongst Australians. In the
Arbitration Court last month (December) in the case of the Furniture Trade
Society and A Hordern <fc Sons (which case would affect us under the Common
llule) it was proved that Beale & Co.’s wages rates are higher than full union
rates. It was proved that we pay in the four branches embraced by our busi-
ness at the least ten percent, higher than union rates, and actually up to forty
per cent, higher on the average to cabinet makers than the Court award, which is
fixed for two years. Naturally we have the best men in the trade and pay them
from double to treble the wages paid to piano workmen in Germany. Of the
latter, at this moment, in the depth of the dread winter, thousands are on strike
in Berlin and Leipzig against their harsh conditions. The pianos imported from
Germany at £l5 (300 marks) are sold in Australia at £45. Why not obtain
real value from your own fellow-citizens and refuse to back the German sweater?
We offer you a Beale Australian Piano, full size, “College” Model, at £39
spot cash, ten times better in every respect than the £45 German article, and
guaranted for 25 years.
Advance Australia! And the only way to advance is along the lines of
industry all the time.
“The Most Advanced Industry of Australia.”

are made upon Australian inventions patented throughout the World.
You will find that the Beale Pianos differ essentially from all others.
others have complete iron frame.
others have steel tuning-system.
others have iron wrest-planks.
others have imperishable sounding-boards.
others have true harp-shaped scale.
others have patented panels.
others have patent hexagonal bass-strings.
others are built up of many plies.
others will stand all climates.
Please
No firm of piano-builders in Europe calculates its own scales, designs, makes the patterns, makes its
own foundry-flasks and apparatus, moulds and casts its own iron frames.
No other firm designs, moulds, casts, machines, electroplates, and finishes its own brass and bronze work.
Even the castors (rollers), which it is impossible to buy of reliable strength and positiv e working, we
design and make ourselves in Australia.
We designed and built the traversing drilling machines which drill the patent iron frames each with 300
holes. We designed and built the tapping machines, with semi-automatic action, which make the screw-
threads in the patent frames.
We designed and built in our own shops the spinning-machines which turn out the patent hexagonal
bass-strings which alone can be guaranteed to remain true.
The entire installation of machinery, electrically driven, was erected by our own staff.
We have made and sold more than
5000
Beale Pianos in Australia, and these, placed end to end, would reach five miles.
CASH OR EASY
TERMS.
REPAIRS and REPLACEHENTS.
We have all facilities at hand. All parts at all times in stoclc. When a
foreign piano is injured or requires restoration in any way, there are no parts ob-
tainable, for the name of the foreign makers is legion, and no importer reckons
to keep all parts in stock. When from rust, carelessness, or any cause strings in
foreign pianos have to be replaced—a frequent occurrence—no one here knows
the maker of the wire, consequently the new wire will not match or keep in tune
with the old. It cannot be helped, and buyers of foreign pianos must submit, yet
no piano-builder mixes up wires of different makers. Any restoration is and
must be a “ fake ” under such circmumstances, but the original builder can
always restore or replace as at first. Have an eye to the future and buy a Beale
Australian Piano.
TESTIHONIALS.
The recommendations of travelling artists are notoriously purchasable, and
must often be dearly bought. The leading trade periodical is Music Trades of
New York, which recently, in denouncing the practice, narrated the extreme case
of an old-established organ-making firm which began the manufacture of pianos
and proceeded to buy such recommendations. It was a fatuous policy, the firm
was unable to stand the cost, its business was taken over last year by a well-
known Chicago music-house, and the name alone remains. The testimonials we
offer proceed from the generosity of the ladies and gentlemen sending them. We
could not if we would, and we would not if we could, attempt to purchase any of
them. Thousan sof people, in all walks of life, have shown us the great kind-
ness to forward their favorable opinions, founded upon actual inspection. Others,
as from Calcutta, Fiji, and New Caledonia, give their expressions as to the con-
struction of our p'anos. You cannot have stronger assurance than the verdict of
the thousands who have bought and paid for Beale Pianos.
If you are not a possible buyer yourself, you will favor us with the names of
any of your acquaintances who may be intending to purchase a piano?
We make allowances for old pianos and supply our instruments for cash or
upon easy terms of payment. Remember, they are supplied direct from factory
to user, and are within the reach of all.
The Beale factories are fitted throughout with the most modern plant, elec-
trically lighted and driven. No patents for any parts of pianos have been taken
out in Australia from abroad, but we have many pitented improvements of our
own. Hence the entire field of discovery and practice is open to us, which is not
open to any other manufacturer in the world. Foreign traders cannot rob us of
those and other advantages.
THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.
BEALE SEWING MACHINES
AT LESS THAN HALF-PRICE!
The ever-growing demand for BEALE AUSTRALIAN PIANOS has compelled us to largely increase the size of our factories, which now cover two entire
acres of floor space. We are in consequence relinquishing the manufacture of Sewing Machines, Stands and Cabinet-Work, which have been brought to the highest
pitch of perfection. You cannot obtain iro n any part of the World such beautiful woodwork, with fine marquetry inlays, the whole built up of many plies to resist
trying climates. The Machines themvelves are the latest type of Torpedo shuttle (known also as the vibrating system). They stitch backwards and forwards, and do all
embroidery and plain sewing without removing the presser-foot. No other machines have such improvements. In order to make an early clearance we have resolved to
ollatthee SLAUGHTER PRICES :
£2l Full Cabinet, to £8
£I3 I3s to X 6 IQs
£l6 16s f-Cabinet, to £7 10s
£l2 12s i-Cabinet, to £6
.£l4 14s to £7
£ll lls Fam ily, to £5
Beautiful Treadle Machines at £ 3.
Stocks of Needles and parts will be permanently kept at our several Branches, and repairs as
heretofore will be carried out at our Factories. For these we have unequalled facilities.

. This is the first and only sale held by Beale & Company in 25 years, is absolutely genuine, and will certainly close out the Department.

A TORPID LIVER.
A CATALOGUE OF SYMPTOM
The Gao of Mr?. M. WING.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
Events which havo evidently left an
impression upon the mind never to be
obliterated—events which at one timo
were beheld with grief and dismay—
are here related by Mrs. Maria Wing,
of Dora-street, Hurstville, upon whom
a pressman recently called, and was
courteously accorded an interview.
“It is twelve years ago now," ex-
plained Mrs. Wing, “since I took Cle-
ments Tonic for indigestion and neu-
ralgia, but if it were twice that time I
should never forget how much I owe
to that remedy for its powerful cura-
tive influence."
“Had your afflictions been in exis-
tence Jong ?"
“Quite seven years, so you can ga-
ther from that what a wreck I was.
Even from childhood I had been a
great sufferer from nervousness, and
each year found that complaint more
fully developed then ever. When neu-
ralgia started, the pains in my jaws,
all about my head, I ehind mv eyes,
and at the back of my neck and right
down my shoulders were unendurable.
Might after night passed by and not
an hour's sleep, with tl e result that,
by-and-bve. I felt almost da/ed for the
want of rest. 'J his, however, was not
the full extent of my ad .a rsities, for 1
daresay you know what indigestion is
like ? It meant that whenever I took
any food—and J did not have much at
a time, my ap| etile being so poor—[
got a feeling in the chest like a tight-
ness, as if had overeaten, and a
nasty, full, tir-comfortable feeling also
affected me in the stomach. But the
bilious attacks l had were horrible.
Some days, from the time I got up in
the morning till the sun went down in
the evening, I could do nothing but
retch, and on those particular occa-
sions I had such a fearful sensation in
mv head that I could not hold it up.
Talk’ about being depressed—why, that
was no name for it ; I was absolutely
melancholy, and what also helped me
to be so was a continual presentiment
that something was going to happen.
Try how I would L could not < t out
of my head the idea that some ! ind of
trouble was awaiting me, and if it
didn't come to-day I was sure it would
arrive to-morrow. Oh ! it was a life
that one should be pitied for leading,
and I'm sure I’ll do all I can to help
other poor women out of similar pre-
dicaments. Now T know that an infal-
lible cure is within the reach of every-
body, I consider it but light that I
fhould make known to the world what
that cure is, and for this reason alone
1 am actuated in going into full de-
tails. Yes, when those bilious attacks
were on 1 was so upset generally that
I could not oven take a drink of water.
Nothing whatever would stay on the
stomach, so it’s nothing to marvel at
that I got as thin as .a shadow and as
weak as a kitten. And the giddiness
that 1 had to contend with. It used to
come on suddenly, and a'most cause
me to fall sometime®, and it was
strange how my eves felt so swollen
and the sight bad besides.”
“Those are symptoms arising from
the disordered state of the liver,” re-
marked the wrftpr.
“Kxactlv, and further evidence in
support of that lay in the fact that
my month had a bitter taste, and 1
had a white coating over my tongue :
and not until I had ta'en some Cle-
ments Tonic could I get rid of those
symptoms cither.”
“What medicine had you taken pre-
viously ?”
“Nearly every kind of pills and me-
dicines ever heard of, and there was
not one of them that was worth mv
while to refer to. Such useless trash J j
didn't think possible could exist, and
it just shows you how advisable it is
to relate such experiences as so l
that people’s money should not be
thrown away. Doctors, too, they used
to attend me and prescribe medicine,
but it never came to anything. I felt
no better after taking it, and that is
why, to tell you the truth, I started
to lose ho[ e, and think that L was
never going to get rid of my com-
plaints again. One thing that caused
me no small amount of alarm was pal-
Eitation of the heart, which usfed to
e particularly troublesome whcn lving
down at night, but Clements Tonic
soon set my mind at rest by making
the heart's pulsation and
steady, and at the I ob-
served a great falling off inbother
1 previously had with My
chest became eased of its
feelings, and when I had bt'etv iuin#r
Clements 'ionic a little, while the dis-
comforts to the stomach after meals
was entirely absent. So far so good, l
ihought ; but there was a lot for Cle-
ments Tonic to do still, if it was only
equal to the occasion.”
“And was it equal to all your re-
quirements ?"
“Yes; every one of them, and what
a lucky woman I was to be sure ! Just
fancy being almost mad with pain like
l frequently used to be, to fruitlessly
spend money in all directions trying to
get relief, to becoino hopeless and do—
spondent, and then. fit.'last, to get a*,
medicine li.l erto overlooked! which,
was the very one that could cube me !'.
Don't you think I had cause to oei
deeply grateful ? Ah, well ! I sjj'.cerciy/
trust that my experience may i\ ach
the ears of others, who will soon
know that I have spoken nothin • but
hs truth about Clements'Tonic. With-
out exaggeration, that remcdy..set me
entirely free from all the pgins 1 have
mentioned, gave me such-an appetite
that I could eat anything' That was
going, and so invi -orated my mrvous
system that 1 could stand any kind of
noise without trembling, and as for
having ugly dreams er spending my
time in worrying over imaginary trou-
bles aheau, why, 1 never thought of
such things after being on Clements
Tonic a few weeks. And if am thing
will make a person sleep souivdlv it is
Clements Tonic, fpr by using it it be-
came a regular tiling for me to fall off
shortly after getting into , bed, and
not till nearly breakfast time would l
wake again. It was a delightful chan e,
and it will give you an idea of the
perfect cure it was when I tell you
that I am now heavier than I have
ever been before.”
“Well, that ought to b« a good in-
dex as to your health.”
“And so it is, for I can now work
well and enjoy the privilege of living,
whereas before talcing Clements Tonic
life was only a drudgery that was not
worth enduring. I have advised dozens
of people to take Clements TonSc, and
shall always do so. You also have my
permission to publish this interview in
any way you like for the benefit of the
general community.”

Dear .Sir, —Twelve years ago I had a severe attack of
Influenza, and Bronchitis, and for ten years was suffering
with a terrible cough, and was wasting away. I had
medical attendance, and tried various medicines recom-
mended, but without success until, on my daughter’s
recommendation, I used Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, with
the result that it completely cured me, and I am per-
fectly free from any cough now.

BRONCHIAL CATARRH.
An obstinate case cured by Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
After other treatment had failed.
Mr. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I have a son, 9 years of a ge,
who for two years suffered from Chronic Bronchial
Catarrh. I could never leave him away from me a night
on any consideration. Everybody just dreaded his being-
left to their care. The least dampness of foot, cool sea
breeze after a hot day, or cold blowing wind, would con-
fine him to the house for days. I had medical advice,
and used different patent medicines, but without success,
until I gift* one small bottle of your Bronchitis Cure,
which has freed him completely from the Catarrh. Since
then he lias been out in damp weather to school, and goes
about like any other child ; in fact, lie "seems to have lost
a big burden, and is quite well. Will you please accept
my gratitude.—Believe me, vours gratefully,

Bronchitis Cure.
A sufferer 70 years old cured by it.
Well and hearty now.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I am a storekeeper,
living in this township for the last 20 years. One of my
oldest customers has been subject to Bronchitis for a
number of years, and has been in the hospital with it
several times. Hearing of your valuable medicine, he
tried it, and found that it gave him great relief. One
bottle was sufficient to put him right. This gentleman
is over 70 years of age, an old bushman who has been in
these parts for the last 30 years, and is well known. He
makes my house his home when here, and got the medi-
cine from me. He is at my place now, and he says that
this winter is the freest he has had from Bronchitis for a
number of years, and he wishes to return you thanks for
your valuable Bronchitis Cure. He is well and hearty
now. You are quite at liberty to publish this or any part
of it you like, as it may be of great benefit to other people
suffering from Bronchitis.—Yours truly,

CONSUMPTION*
Too ill to leave his bad.
A complete arte.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Bear Sir, —I am writing 1 to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago 1 began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be con-
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to yon for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed,
but I commenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. lam glad to say that the two lots of medicine
you sent have effected a complete cure, for which accept
my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

Letters Reporting Cures in Cases of
Gravel and Stone.
From Mr. G. H. Robinson, Harbour View, Watson’s Bay, N.S.W., 29th September, 1903.
“ I have much pleasure in testifying as to the. value of Warner’s Safe Cure, as, gradually and
without pain, it removed a stone from my kidneys which had been accumulating for years.”
From Mr. Ernest Otto Beckmann, Prince of Wales Hotel, George Street, Moonta, S.A.,
27th November, 1903.
“ Nine years ago I was afflicted with what the doctors termed calculus, or gravel in the kidneys.
I suffered excruciating pain, and could obtain no permanent relief from the medicines I took. The
doctors could do nothing to benefit me, and I was nearly in despair when a friend advised me to try
Warner’s Safe Cure. Knowing that that medicine was highly recommended for kidney, liver and
bladder diseases, I commenced taking it, also Warner’s Safe Pills in conjunction. Warner s Safe Cure
seemed to act immediately on the kidneys, releasing from them a large quantity of gravel, which
passed off in my water and gave me great relief. My system soon became clear from all such deposits,
and as I have had no trouble since that time, I consider myself effectually cured. I am now in the
enjoyment of good health.”
From Mr. A. Spiers, 98 Morehead-street, Redfern, N.S.W., 10th February, 1904. ~ -
“About six years ago I was a great sufferer from gravel and kidney trouble. My doctors said I
had Bright’s Disease of the kidneys. My sight, too, became very impaired. I tried Turkish Baths
and many other remedies without obtaining relief. I was in misery for at least 18 months, when a
friend advised me to give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial. I did so, taking also Warner’s Safe Pills, and
in nine weeks I was a new man. I attribute my recovery solely to Warner’s medicines as I have not
suffered in any way since.”
From Mr. John F. Kennedy, Argyle Street, Parramatta, N.S.W., 22nd September, 1903.
“ Some years ago I was attacked by great pains in the kidneys and bladder, accompanied by
swelling in the groin. The pain was so severe that, even while lying in bed, I could scarcely bear it,
whilst to walk across the room was agony. I was treated by doctors off and on for five years, and at
last they told me that it was no use giving me any more medicine, but to take care of myself and take
plenty of nourishment. I was laid up feeling very bad when I happened to read one of your
pamphlets. I sent for some Warner’s Safe Cure, and continued taking it for three months. After
taking three or four bottles, it brought gravel in great quantities from me, and I was soon able to get
up and walk about, after three months on my back. I am well known in Parramatta, and people were
surprised to see the way I had improved after taking Warner’s Safe Cure. 1 went to the chemist,
from whom I bought the medicine, and when I showed him the gravel it had brought from my system
he said it was marvellous.”
From Mr. James Grant, grocer, 126 Young-street, Annandale, N.S.W., 12th February, 1903.
“Some 10 years ago I was attacked by great pains in the back and groin, which at times were so
severe that I almost screamed with agony. I was treated by doctors for fully five years, and also tried
several patent medicines, but obtained no relief. lat last despaired of ever getting well again, but
was recommended by a friend to try Warner’s Safe Cure, as it had given him immense relief in a simi-
lar case. I followed his advice, and, after taking the medicine for a while, I passed a stone about
three-quarters of an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide. lam pleased to say that, after this stone
had come away, my sufferings were at an end, and I have not suffered in the slightest degree since.
Many of my friends know of my case, and I always keep the stone I passed. I can confidently recom-
mend Warner’s Safe Cure in cases like mine, as I am thoroughly convinced that it saved me many
years of agony, if not my very life itself.”
From Mr. W. W. Wignell, Elderslie, Camden, N.S.W., 19th March, 1903.
“I have great pleasure in strongly recommending Warner’s Safe Cure. For the last eight years
I have been suffering from gravel, and have found that Warner’s Safe Cure has done me a wonderful
lot of good.”
From Mrs. Annie Dixon, Mareeba, Q.
“ About five years ago I was taken ill, and could not leave my bed. I had read one of your pam-
Ehlets and thought I would give Warner’s Safe Cure a trial. Before I had finished taking one bottle
was up again. It drove a lot of gravel out of my system. The doctor seemed to have no faith in my
cure, and said that I should be troubled with the same malady again within two years. lam thankful
to say, however, that I have never had a return of it since, and I think five years is long enough to
prove the permanency of the cure.”
Uric Acid. —The presence of this acid in the blood is the cause of people suffering from Rheu-
matism, Gout, Neuralgia, Backache, Lumbago, Sciatica, Gravel and Bladder Troubles. The accumu-
lation of uric acid in the blood is a certain indication that the kidneys are acting inefficiently.
Warner’s Safe Cure acts specifically upon the kidneys, and invariably restores those vital organs to
health and activity, when all suffering due to uric poisoning ceases. So potent is Warner’s Safe Cure
that it will even cure Bright’s Disease of the kidneys.
A simple test to make as to the condition of the kidneys is to put some of the urine, passed the
first thing in the morning, into a bottle or covered glass, and let it stand until next morning. If it is
then cloudy, or if it contains a sediment like brick-dust, or if particles float about in it, or it is of ap
unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time should be lost iu commencing to take
Warner’s Safe Cure. [6].
The Joyful Truant.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GLORIA BURNS TO DOROTHY FITZPATRICK.
MY DEAR OLD FITZIE,—I’m writing to
you with a tear in one eye, and a wicked,
wicked wink in the other. Just think of
it! I have been expelled, and the cause was
nothing more nor less than stopping out all night
with a man. There was no public expulsion. I
was ordered to the lecture-room, where the Old
Dame —she didn’t have the necessary pluck herself
—had sent the “ Little Minister ” to deal with me.
(Oh ! hut he did look as though he would have
liked to have been the man.)
“The full extent of your—er—escapade is
known to the authorities,” he said ; “ but, for ob-
vious reasons, the particulars have been kept from
the other girls.” I was requested to announce m /
withdrawal from the school, and so on, and so on.
You can understand just how I received him, but
the little fool affected an air of martyrdom, and,
plunking down on his knees, offered up a prayer.
Fitzie, if you want to know the utter depravity of
man, catch a parson praying for your soul’s salva-
tion. the while leering out of the tail of his eye at
the lips of soft lace that kiss a woman’s ankle. I
was never so ashamed in my life. I wanted to
shake the life out of him, but —I was crying.
I only remember wishing, with a great big sob,
that Jack were there to catch the sanctimonious
little prig up in his arms, and throw him out of
the window ; then I slipped out at the door, leav-
ing him on his knees.
But, dear Fitzie, you must be dying to know all
about my awful, yet interesting crime.
Well, last Wednesday afternoon, our class went
to Fern Tree Gully, with the Old Dame and the
old Professor, for botany ; and there we camped.
I fancy I can hear the old Professor droning away
now. Good old Bladder o’ Lard ! Do you re-
member the day a spider started out to traverse
that spotlesss head ? There was the sweep of the
hand time after time, and I know you laughed.
But the spider kept on and on, until, in a moment
of mental aberration —splash ! —and it was no
more.
Well, Fitzie, the old Professor kept mono-
tonously on. The Old Dame snored peacefully in
her folding-chair. There was the hum of bees
and the droning of many insects. An impulse
seized me to wander away and stretch myself in
the shade of some hidden tree. A little while,
and I struck the main road. Climbing over a
fence to it, I sat for a moment or two upon the
top rail, watching a buggy coming from the
distance. In that buggy was the cause of all my
trouble—Jack !
“Hullo, Glorious! You here? How glad I
am,” he shouted.
He was invited to keep silent in his gladness.
Then I told him in an undertone how I was play-
ing truant.
He laughed at first, but after a while became
grave—he always does when meaning mischief.
Then he said : “I don’t suppose you’re game to
come for a drive, little girl ? ”
“Little girl” and “game.” Ah. Fitzie! he
told me afterwards that he knew my weakness.
In a moment we were off, bound for Auntie
Ruth’s, where the fine mulberries grow.
I don’t think I shall ever forget that drive,
Fitzie; for, after I had finished making fun of
Jack, and he had grown almost savagely silent,
and as we drove along the narrow, hilly, winding
road I became dreamy, and—and—ah ! the sense
of it is in my brain, but the word—there is no
word.
I spoke to Jack as in a dream. In an instant
he had an arm around me, and I was awakened.
I thrust him away almost fiercely, but I know that
he understood me, for, after a pause, he asked,
blushing still:
“ Do you know what you called me ? ”
I put my hands to my ears. I had a faint recol-
lection.
“ You called me ‘ Jack, dear.’ Didn’t you mean
it, Gloria ? ” he asked.
But we had pulled up at his Aunt Ruth’s place,
so I jumped clear, saying, “ I’m not quite certain
that it should not have been ‘Jack, darling’!”
You should have seen his face then, even though
he knew I was laughing at him.
Dear old Auntie Ruth ! She called me “My
Morning Glory,’’ just as she used to call me when
I was quite a little girl; and oh ! I was ever so
much in love with her then.
But the mulberries, Fitzie ! My lips are red
with them yet, and I have a one-time white dress
that I shall not wear again until the day after I
am married, for there is a huge stain in the lap of
it where I upset a bowl of berries when a lad
came, saying, “Mr. Jack has met with an acci-
dent, Miss Burns.” But it wasn’t all mulberry-
juice, Fitzie. Jack’s head lay there, and he was
bleeding. (You used to call me “a girl of the
grotesque.” How does mulberry-juice and lover’s
blood go ?)
The accident occurred very simply. Uncle Ned
was out in one of the far paddocks. Jack had to
see him, and saddled a horse to ride out. He
tried to jump the horse over the first gate, but it
swerved and tangled itself up in the wire fence.
Jack was thrown and the horse rolled on him,
crushing out all appearance of life.
I forgot truancy then. I had Jack to look
after. He was unconscious for over an hour, and,
Fitzie, I prayed then, for the first time in my life,
willingly. Perhaps some wandering angel took
pity on the little love-smitten maiden in her grief ;
perhaps Jack’s great strength and his youth
worked the wonder, but all I know is that, before
there was time for a doctor to arrive, Jack was
sitting up in a chair, white and very shaky, but
smiling, and protesting that he wasn’t hurt
seriously.
“ I’ll have to take you back at once, or you’ll
catch it,” he said to me, when he learned what
time it was ; but the doctor came then, and there
was nearly two hours’work bandaging contusions
and anointing bruises, and when Jack was delivered
to us, bound-up and plastered, and with his right
arm hanging almost useless by his side, tea was on
the table.
“ We’ve done it now, Gloria,” he said. “ Shall
we stay ? ”
“Might as well be hanged for a sheep as a
lamb,” I answered —there were mulberries on the
board. Besides, Auntie Ruth had been led to
believe that her “ Morning Glory ” was having a
holiday, and had no need to return to the school
until 10 o’clock; so, for the sake of appearances, we
couldn’t rush away supperless.
Well, Fitzie, Jack and I didn’t get a start back
to town until nearly 8 o’clock ; but it was a beauti-
ful evening, and I didn’t trouble much about the
Old Dame, for as we drove along “ we two” con-
cocted a perfectly lovely tale to tell her, and I
reckoned I would only have to answer for leaving
the class without permission.
H was. Jack’s intention to drive me to his
s place, where I could stay all night, and
then for him to take me into school next morning;
out, alas, Fitzie, just after we had left the Gully,
the effects of the poor boy’s fall overpowered him,
and he almost collapsed. We had been having
such a good time driving along, too. I felt him
shiver, heard his breath coming and going in little
short gasps, and, looking up quickly, saw his face
was strained with pain, and white.
“Shall I take the reins, Jack?” I asked him.
He braced himself up. “No, it’s all-right—
Gloria! ” but, oh, Fitzie, I don’t think there is any-
thing so horrible as watching a man—the man you
love—fighting against a faint. He swayed about
with the movement of the buggy like one without
power.
“ Can’t I do something for you, Jack ?”
He shook his head, but, in a moment or two—
“lf you don’t mind, Gloria, just put your —your
arm around me, and steady me a bit, will you ? ”
“If I didn’t mind ! Oh, Fitzie, I held him close
enough—not but that he will hold me closer some
time, I hope—and then—and then, just as we were
fetting along famously—smack !—Jack and I
ung to the ground—the horses dashing along the
track with a portion of battered buggy banging
their heels, and working them into frenzy !
I was stunned for a moment or two. Jack lay
motionless. His right arm was twisted under his
chest in a way that made me shudder.
“ Jack,” I called to him. “Jack ! ” The sough-
ing of the wind in the leaves answered me —a
seeming song of death.
I leaned over him, fearful of all things; yet, ere
I comprehended, I had turned him on his back.
There was a film of dust across his eyes, and his
lips were bleeding.
“ Jack,” I cried again, “ Jack, darling, won’t
you speak to me ? ”
Ah, Fitzie, you will wonder how I managed it,
but I dragged Jack clear of the track. Then I
looked to see if there were any lights near or in
the distance. There was darkness only. I went
in search of water. There was none near the
roadside. I wondered if there were any houses
near, and set up a great cry; not even an echo
came to me. I felt tears in my eyes and blamed
God that they were salt. I rushed along the road
looking for succour. There was nothing but trees,
trees, trees ! I dashed into the scrub, glancing
fearfully behind me at every step lest I should
miss the way. “Water!” I cried; “water!”
and Jack’s bleeding face looked at me wherever I
went. But it was no use, the couritry was dry. I
longed for one of those cool, crystal creeks in the
ranges. Then suddenly a picture came to me ; the
remains of a swagman’s camp alongside the road
as we were driving. Perhaps ! —perhaps!—as I ran
the “perhaps” seemed to grow into certainty.
I reached the camp. There were ashes, a few
ends of wooden matches, a crust of cheese, a crust
of bread. These things seemed to be all, and, in
bitter anger, I turned away. But, ah ! Under
a tree close by was a meat-tin ; beside it the marks
of a dog’s paws. The swagman had given his
dog a drink there, and the tin was half full of
water. Jack hadn’t moved, but his lips were still
bleeding, and I knew that was a sign of life. I
had undone his collar before, and had taken his
coat off and made him a pillow of it. Now I
washed his face and neck and hands, propping
him up that the blood from his lips should not
clot in his throat. I forced some of the water
down his throat, too, and that the dust in his eyes
might not cause him pain, I squirted little tiny
sprays of water beneath the lids.
He came to himself after a weary, weary while,
saying suddenly :
“ Are the horses all right? ”
The horses. How like a man !
I told him they were, and he said in a wander-
ing sort of way : “ And Gloria, dear little Gloria,
where is she ? ”
Of course, I cried out asking him if he did not
know me. Then, with a great light in his eyes,
he seemed to remember. “ You're not hurt, little
girl—are you ? ” But I saw him wince and look
down to his right arm. I knew it was broken.
“Give’s a hand to get up,” he said. I did, but
he fell back, groaning.
There was a pause, then, “ Gloria, Gloria ! ” he
cried ; but I was standing away from him, behind
a tree, taking off an underskirt. I returned, tear-
ing it into strips.
“ What’s that for ? ” he asked ; but for answer
I tore off the sleeve of his shirt, and took gentle
hold of his arm. The bones of the forearm were
broken, and the broken ends grated together. I
cried out myself at the very sound of it, but Jack
stood the pain like an Australian.
“ Broken,” he simply said.
“I am going to bind it,” I replied; and, as
best I could, I set the broken bones, end to end,
and twisted the strips of skirt about it evenly and
close. It did not answer as well as I thought, the
weight of his hand seeming to give the arm an
ugly, sickening bend. So I went behind the
tree for more bandages. A thought had come to
me of my weak ankle, and of the elastic bandage I
was forced to wear. It was like the thought of
sleeping with one’s stocking round one’s neck to
cure a sore throat; but Jack says he will never
part with that bandage now, and the doctor who
set the broken arm reckons that I could have
thought of nothing better.
Well, Fitzie, when I had fixed Jack’s arm in
a sling he wanted to look after the horses, but his
legs wouldn’t work and he was forced to lie down
again.
“ They’ll keep on down the road till somebody
checks them,” I said. “Then we’re sure to be
looked for, ” I added hopefully.
“But we’re not on the main road now,” he
replied. “ I was taking you a short-cut, and
people are not likely to come along here at night.
There ought to be a gate not more than half-a-
mile down the track, though.”
I went to that gate. No horses were there, not
even a sign of them. I went back.
“ Isn’t there a house near, Jack?” I asked him.
“ There’s one about three miles further on, and
there’s a township about two-and-a-half miles
back.”
I shivered ; all that way alone, and in the dark.
But I said, “Do you think you will be all right
whilst lam away, Jack ? You can’t stop here all
night, you know.”
“ By Jove, if you go I’ll go with you,” he said,
striving to get up. But he strove in vain, and at
last I was forced to say, “ Well, Jack, if you won’t
keep still, I shall run straight away at once.”
And what do you think he said, Fitzie. Why—
“ You brave little Glorious!” Then with a
twinkle in his eyes. “ I tell you what, little ’un;
I ’ll keep as still as a church if you ’ll tell me one
thing.”
“ Well,” I answered.
“ Promise,” he said.
I promised.
“ What was it you called me when I was deaf
just now ? ”
“Jack,” I said, saucily.
“ Anything else? ”
“Jack—darling ! ”
He tried to draw my lips down to his, but I
drew back.
“Won’t you let me kiss you, Gloria?” he
pleaded.
“ I’ve not long washed your lips with water that
a swagman’s dog had drunk of,” I answered ; and,
as he still pressed me, “No, no!” I oried. But
IT T,-. • , „ . T
all the same, Fitzieyou may be very sure that I
was on the left-hand side of him, so that at last,
he might draw me to him, for I was shaking like
a leaf, was almost crying, and my throat was full
of sobs. After all that had happened I wanted to
be petted and kissed and made much of, and J ack
just kept on kissing till I had cried out all my
fears and pain and trouble on his shoulder. Oh !
but it took a long time.
I sat by him all that night, dear, and—you know
what is coming—some day within two years—l
promised to wait that long—l’ve given my word
to become Mrs. Jack. You should lust see my
engagement-ring.
But the worst comes now. Dear old Auntie
Ruth was in Melbourne next morning, and,
thinking of Jack’s accident at the farm, called at
the school to get a direction to his place from. me.
I wasn’t there, and, of course, the dear old soul
told the Old Dame all about the joyful truant,
right up to the time of leaving .the farm at 8
o’clock with Jack. The Old Dame said nothing
to Aunt, but made enquiries of address, and
posted off to Jack’s place. I wasn’t there, neither
was he. She hammered two and two together,
and clinched it with her worst construction. When
she came back I was at the school. She didn’t
even frown, just asked me what I had to say for
myself. Now, if I had told the truth things might
have been fixed up without much trouble. But, the
truth to her ! Even you found that irksome at
times. So she cornered me without showing her
hand, then left me to consult with the “Little

I ve been stopping at Jack s place since, looking
after him. Dad came down for me yesterday,
He was very indignant at first with the Old

and said it was all my own fault and Jack s.
And now, Fitzie, I have told you all. So T
finish up with a kiss for you, dear—three, in fact,
one for each cheek, and one for the lips of the

MILKY WHITE.
A family of Norwegians, brought out by a
relative at Cairns (Q.) under the immigration
regulations, arrived in Brisbane to find that they
still had a journey to cover which would cost £2O
in passage money. Two members of the Labor
party came to their rescue by guaranteeing fares.
The New York “tough” is up-to-date in
his methods. Twice within last Christmas week
a woman was found, on a quiet riverside drive in
New York, with emptied pockets and a broken
neck. In each case the robbers had used the new
Japanese jiu-jitsu method of homicide,
“H.W.”: I haven’t seen any referenee
made to the striking resemblance between George
Reid’s face, as depicted by “Hop,” and the
markings on the moon. One evening, Luna
being three days off the full, I left the pub after
closing hour, and, making my uncertain way
along the bush track, pondered from State Par-
liament to Federal, and from Federal to George
Reid. Then, happening to look up, I saw that
individual gazing at me with happy smile. Part
of his face was invisible, which led me to the
conclusion that George was on a wild “jag,” and
had tilted his plug hat over his right optic.
Next evening, to satisfy myself that I had not
imagined all this, I looked at the moon again.
George was still there. A little less real, cer-
tainly; but. judging from appearances, on a
wilder “jag” than ever.


THAT STAB-LIKE PAIN
u Every Picture tells a Story. ”
/
A
jS
It tells
of
Sick,
Ailing
Kidneys
Consider what it means to neglect the kidneys.
They are the great blood filters of the body. All the
blood passes through them once every three minutes, day
and night, to be filtered and purified. Thus the kidneys
remove about 500 grains of impure matter every 24 hours.
So the kidneys are working day and night to keep you
in health. But when they get sick they do not do this
filtering process properly, and some of the uric acid and
waste matters stay in the system. These impurities are
the cause of most diseases.
sdf
BACKACHE
KIDNEY
PILLS
are made to heal and help the kidneys in their great work.
They take out the uric acid (the acid that causes rneuma-
tism, gravel, gout, heart disease, sciatica, and neuralgia);
they take out the water that causes the dropsical
swellings; they relieve backaches, correct the flow from
the kidneys, &c.
But your neighbor’s word, given here, tells the whole
story.
SYDNEY PROOF.
Mr. George Woodroffe, Roseby-street, Drummoyne, writes : —“I am pleased
to be able to tell you of the very great benefit I have derived from the use of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I have been a great sufferer with the kidneys for
the past 17 years. It started with a cold, and eventually inflammation of the
kidneys and bladder set in.
“ I have been treated by some of the cleverest and best-known Sydney
doctors, and was for seventeen and a half weeks in Sydney Hospital, and also two
months in the Coast Hospital, where I had one kidney removed, in order to save
my life, the doctor said ; and though the various treatments eased me for a time,
I was not cured, and would soon relapse into my former condition ; in fact, I
seemed to get worse each time. I also tried all kinds of patent medicines adver-
tised to cure kidney complaint, but they did not give me even temporary relief.
One doctor said I could never be cured ; and after so many failures to get a cure,
and the years of suffering, I began to think he was right.
“I was so bad that to work was almost impossible. My brother kept on
worrying me to try Doan’s Pills, if I only took one box. To please him, I got a
box and took a few doses. They seemed to make me worse, and I said I would
take no more. He prevailed on me to go on with them. I commenced taking
them again, and before I had finished the box I felt extraordinary well. I had
not felt so well for years ; the pills were working wonders for me. I continued
taking them, and am now cured of the headaches and backache, and I sleep well
at night. These pills have been a Godsend to me, and I feel that it is a pleasure
to live. My friends tell me the improvement in me already is positively wonder-
ful.”
Seven months later Mr. Woodroffe states :—“ I have not taken the pills for
some time. lam perfectly cured. I can do heavier work than I have been able
to do for years. lam not troubled with the secretions or pains in my back, and
have gained a stone in weight during the past three months.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all
Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes,
15s. 3d.), or will be posted on receipt of price by Foster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney. ....

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ODDESS, blithe and young and fair,
I jj" With the brow so broad and noble,
And the eyes undimmed by trouble,
And the lips that laugh at care,
And the brown limbs fleet and free —
Hast thou quite forgotten me ?
Maid divine, dost thou not mind
When we raced the streams together,
In the mad, glad winter-weather,
While thy hair streamed on the wind
Like a flying flame of gold ?
Ah, the vanished days of old !
Lady, bright, dost thou forget
When we wandered, we two only,
By the side of waters lonely,
From sunrising to sunset,
And I made a Rhyme for thee
Full of magic melody?
When the morn’s flag was unfurled,
Thou wert with me, rapture bringing,
While my heart a song was singing
Of the Beauty of the World—
Does the morn no longer glow ?
Was it all so long ago ?
On the purple hills afar
Are thy swift feet gleaming, gliding ?
Or art thou o’er grey plains riding
Underneath the Morning Star?
Maid divine, my fear is sore
That I ne’er shall see thee more.
The Goddess of Health dwells in far-off places.
If you are living by the sea, her feet are beautiful
upon the mountains; if your home is on the
mountains, she wanders oy the shore of the
many-laughing main. The one thing certain
is that she never lives in your immediate
neighborhood—supposing, of course, that you
have reached a stage in life when you need her
help badly. If you have not reached that stage,
give thanks, but do not boast. The arrow fiieth at
noonday.
« Dr « *
Three eminent medical authorities informed me
that, so far as I was concerned, there was no salu-
brity in Sydney. The kind of health I wanted could
only be found on the other side of the Mountains,
upon some high table-land, beyond the reach of
the sea-breeze, where the air is pure and dry, and
there falls not rain nor hail nor any snow. Or
words to that effect. An enthusiastic friend ad-
vised me to go to Orange, in the vicinity of which,
he said, he had spent the happy years of his boy-
hood. “ All the best people know me,” he added.
“ You have only to mention my name, and you
will be treated like a prince. Nothing will be too
good for you.” He offered me letters of introduc-
tion, but I thought that they would be unneces-
sary in the circumstances. Orange is, I learnt from
other sources, the true home of Hygeia. She has
favored haunts elsewhere, as Yenus had, but Orange
is her Cythera. Once I arrived there, I might
safely throw physic to the dogs. Stimulants also.
The local air is a delicious combination of balm and
ambrosia, and the fortunate inhabitants walk about
the streets wreathed in perpetual smiles —the
result of subtle atmospheric intoxication. Orange
was evidently the place for me. I went there.
• * * *
It was night when I arrived, and I had to stay
at an hotel. The hotel was full of Christmas
visitors, but a room was found for me with a nar-
row slit of a window at one end of it, and space
enough inside for a bed, washstand, and a chair.
I went to sleep with a sick-headache, but with the
hope of making glad discoveries, and verifying all
the fine things I had heard, in the morning. . . .
The morning rushed in on me with a roar. Just
outside my slit of window, which opened on the
verandah, two Christmas visitors were struggling
up and down in the fierce embrace of battle. It
was the pounding of their heavy boots on the
boards, and their howls of rage that aroused me.
They exhaled an odor which was not that of am-
brosia. It was the smell of whisky. I knew it
again. Suddenly they disengaged, and lumbered
down to the bar—to take in a fresh stock of their
warlike motive power, I suppose. I got up,
and also went downstairs. The landlord, a stout,
florid person, with a mildly-humorous eye, asked
me if I had slept well.
“ I thought you told me that this was a quiet
hotel,” I said by way of reply.
“So it is,” he remarked ; “ too quiet, worse
luck. But things will be livelier next week, when
the races are on.”
# * * #
The first observation I made, after leaving the
landlord, gave me a favorable impression of the
climate of Orange. There were several servant-girls
in the hotel, and they were all fine, big, strapping
wenches, with broad shoulders, and arms fit to
pillow the heads of giants. I noticed subsequently
that most of the women of Orange are of larger
build than their sisters in Sydney. The former-
speaking of them as vessels, which is an old poetical
licence —have a nobler “displacement” than the
latter. There must be 3ome curious forcing influence
in the air of Orange. The boarders staying at the
hotel were mostly men from the country—big, sun-
baked young men who had come into the town to
have a good time. They were not, with some ex-
ceptions, riotous, or even noisy, but their look of
superfluous strength irritated me. Fortunately I
met with another invalid who was also staying at
the hojfcel—a small, thin man who had led a most
varied and picturesque life all over the world. He
was an Irishman and had been, amongst other
things, a trusted official of the Boer Government.
As a companion he was a God-send, and we
agreed with regard to most questions; but he would
have it that his malady was worse than mine,
which was absurd. I had often smiled at this
pathetic vanity of invalids. Now I know it has
a reason in nature. A man must be proud of
something. One day he is reduced to being proud
of his decrepitude.
• • * *
I triumphed over my friend very soon. I had a
relapse. A doctor was called in. He wrote a
prescription and told me that he could do nothing
more for me, and that, although I might take a
turn for the worse, I might also be better in the
morning. I was scared, but not so badly as I
expected to be. There was no time. The trouble
was not coming ; it was in the room. None of the
thoughts supposed to be usual on such occasions
passed through my brain. I had a feeling of
vague remorse for a misspent life, but it was not
strong enough to force itself on my consciousness.
A hurried half-conjecture was all I had to give to
the Unknown Future, The thought that held me
in its grip was— lsat coming now ? I shall never
again believe in oeath-bed repentances—except,
perhaps, in the cage of sinners who die of old age.
It was a long, long lonesome night. But I fell
asleep after all.
• • • •
After some days I was able to walk slowly up the
main street and inhale the boasted air of Orange.
It was hot and full of dust. I sat down in a small
rectangular public park, through which runs a
noble waste-water channel, dug out by the muni-
cipality, and, no doubt, a solace to persons of
leisure who walk upon its banks. There seemed
to be quite a number of these fortunate individuals
in the park. All the seats were occupied by them.
I noticed that they were mostly old, which also
speaks well for the climate. I got into conversa-
tion with one, and mentioned two or three names
of residents supplied to me by my enthusiastic-
friend in Sydney. The ancient man laughed till
the tears ran down his ancient nose.
“Why,” he said, “X went insolvent and left
Orange years ago, Y died of drink, and Z —that old
man with the red nose and long grey beard, on the
seat yonder—is supported by his grandchildren.”
I didn’t ask about any of the others.
» * * •
The fetish of Orange is its thermometer, which
is kept at the post-office, in a nice, coo’,
shady place. The official record of heat
is—so I was informed by a man who has no
chance of making money out of visitors—
never allowed to get as high as lOOdeg. “ They’d
smash the thermometer first,” he observed. One
day during the heat-wave I was talking for a
moment with a blacksmith who had come to the
door of his smithy to get a breath of air. “My
oath,” he said, “it’s a scorcher out here.” And
he went back to his glowing forge with a sigh of
relief.
• * * *
I am now staying at a quiet boarding-house.
There are several young men, two or three
daughters of the house, a piano, almost a new
baby, belonging to a lady-lodger, and seventy
fowls in the establishment. The landlady is a
nice, motherly person, who seems to take an
interest in me. _ She says I am the living image
of her brother-in-law Tom, who died of drink.
On the second evening after I arrived she ap-
peared to think I was in low spirits, and (dear,
kindly soul!) told me a story to cheer me up.
“ I had a young fellow staying with me once,
and he had just the same thing the matter with
him that you have. His people were rich, and he
had a doctor with him in the house to look after
him. The doctor occupied the very room you are
in. There was nothing spared. The best port-
wine, and sprays, and tabloids for killing germs,
and scented pastilles to burn in the room, and
everything you could think of, and more, that
young man had. He was getting on well, too,
and after a few months could run up and down
the stairs as well as anybody. Then he left me,
and I heard no more of him for several weeks.”
“ And then ? ”
“He got low-spirited about his weight, and shot
himself, poor young fellow.”
And this was the person who had just the same
thing the matter with him that I have !

When Willie was Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“% M J E’VE ’ad our tea,” Mother said, as
\ \ Father entered the kitchen “ aven’t
T T we?”
The two children nodded; and Father, after
glancing round doubtfully, sat down at the table,
half of which was set for the meal. The other
half was bare, save for the lamp, a penny bottle of
ink, and several pieces of paper. At that end
Tommy, the boy, sat writing.
“Y’ must eat, y’ know, Dad,” said Mother.
“ It oarn’t make no difference, now the little chap’s
,” and she put a dish of stew before her
husband.
Father ate stolidly for some moments; then,
with his fork, he made a gesture towards Tommy.
“What’s Tom doin’ ?” he asked.
“Never you mind now,” replied Mother.
“ Wait till y’ve finished tea. What’s the use of
upsettin’ yourself ? ”
Father finished his meal in silence, whilst Tom
wrote upon and tore up sheet after sheet of paper.
Mother went behind him, and looked over his
shoulder.
“ Cam’t you get it, my son ? ” she asked.
“ The larst line beats me,” replied Tommy.
“ It’s a bit of poetry for the paper, about Willie,”
Mother explained. “ We’re goin’ to take it to the
office to-night, Father. Tommy’s writin’ it.”
Tommy blushed. Father nodded.
“ I thought about that,” he said. “I thought
we ought to put somethin’ in, though it carn’t do
the pore boy no good now.”
Mother wiped away a tear.
“Cheer-up, Mary,” Father said, patting her
arm. “ Carn’t you get it, Tommy ? ”
“It’s the larst line,” said Tommy. “I want
somethin’ to rhyme with ‘best’.”
“ Read it out,” said Father, and Tommy read :
Little Willie, we have missed you,
But we know it’s for the best,
For we know you are an angel bright—
“ Somethin’ to go with ‘ best,’ he said anxiously.
Father took the paper and read the lines over
and over again, muttering them under his breath.
He scratched his head. “ Guest, lest, chest, pes—
rest,” he murmured. Then he said aloud, “And
have gone to the Heavenly rest. That’ll do.”
Tommy took the paper, wrote the words down,
and read:
“ Little Willie, we have missed you,
But we know it’s for the best,
For we know you are an angel bright,
And have gone to the Heavenly rest.”
“ My pore, pore, dead son !” Mother cried, and
burst into tears as Father wrote on the paper :
“Inserted by his sorrowing father, mother, sister
and brother.”
The angel Consolation comes in strange guises.

The 40 State scholarships competed for by
the youths of Victoria have been duly announced,
and 60 per cent, of the passes were obtained by
the sons of teachers of State schools. When the
head-teacher of a school is coaching half-a-dozen
youths, including his son, for a scholarship, it seems
fair to presume that the best of the tuition will go
to the teacher’s son. That is unfair; yet to bar
teachers’ sons would also be unfair. There does
not seem an easy way out, except to do away with
the need of the scholarships by making secondary
education free.


Weak and Delicate
Debilitated and Languid for Years. Health and Vigor now Fully
Restored. Most Remarkable Cure.

Mrs. Mabel Boulton, of Turbot
St,, Brisbane, Queensland, sends
us her photograph, and says:
“From my infancy I was weak
and delicate, and grew to bo any-
thingbut a robust child, suffering
from debility, no appetite, and
the usual consequences of such
complaints. But my parents,
hearing of the health-restoring
properties of Ayer's Sarsaparilla,
procured some for me, and I am
happy to say that after having
taken two bottles I regained
health and vigor, and a good
appetite, and have not troubled
the doctors since. I am now
married and have a family of my
own. am strong and well, and can
recommend Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
as a good family medicine.”
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla is certainly a splendid family medicine. It is just as
good for tlie child as for the parent. The only difference is in the dose.
The thin, pale schoolgirl is as much benefited as her tired, nervous mother.
The rapidly growing boy, weak and languid, is as promptly aided as his
overworked and overanxious father. Keep this grand medicine in the house.
A dose at the right time will often save a long and expensive sickness.
All Sarsaparillas are not alike. Look out for that. Avoid the many
substitutes and imitations. Insist upon getting “Ayer’s.”
