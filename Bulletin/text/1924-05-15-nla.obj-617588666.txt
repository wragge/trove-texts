The Red Page
Poetry as Egotism
In liis essay “The Lyric” John Drink-
water declares himself in complete agreement
with Coleridge’s definition of poetry as ‘the
best words in the best order.” According to
the amiable Drinkwater, this dictum is still
—a century after it was delivered —the last
word in the matter. And, if I mistake not,
it will still be subject to quotation a hundred
years hence —as the last word in banality.
For by that date, let us hope, it will be
recognised even by academics that the poet
begins where the cleverest “literary artist”
leaves off, and that a most emphatic distinc-
tion exists between all writing, however ex-
cellent, and poetry.
“If a sparrow come before my window,”
. said Keats, “I take part in its existence and
peck about the gravel.” And elsewhere: “A
poet is the most unpoetical of anything in
existence, because he has no identity: he is
continually in for and filling some other
body.” The poetic nature, therefore, “has
no character—it enjoys light and shade; it
lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or 10w....
It has as much delight in conceiving an lago
as an Imogen. What shocks the virtuous phi-
losopher delights the chameleon poet.” Now
Keats probably knew more about the psy-
chology of poets than any other Englishman
that ever lived. His precepts are ineii'aceably
bitten into the mind of the literate world
They are as it were touchstones by which
every poet must test the validity of each
poem that he writes and each new theory
that he formulates. Even at the present
moment, when the poetic consciousness seems
to be wrought into a condition, of feverous
disgust and speculation, with bards to right
and left invoking mutually hostile gods—
pJaclf Lindsay at loggerheads with Davie
McKee Wright is a local instance —even in
this uproar the irresistible action of desire
that gave life to Keats’s poetry turns divi-
sion into unison; and his supremacy is
acclaimed by all.
He contains a century of poets. The aery
raptures of Shelley, the magical twilight of
Coleridge, the grandiose egotism of Words-
worth, Tennyson’s lyric artistry, the freighted
loveliness of Francis Thompson’s lines, the
satyr-note echoing through the Arcadian
poetry of Hugh McCrae—John Keats could
pack all these and perhaps even rarer riches
than these into less verse than would fill this
column. One turns from his poems to his
letters with some abatement of delight, it is
true; but so might an audience upon Olym-
pus when Apollo puts aside his lyre and in-
dulges in “divine chit-chat.” Here is the
best poet since Shakspeare (when all’s said)
putting his strong young thoughts into Eng-
lish as racy and prolific as Shakspeare’s own
prose. Keats’s letters are packed with the
best possible commentary on Keats’s poetry,
and indeed upon the poetic nature in all its
mysterious workings. Here, if anywhere,
we may learn what may be learnt of the
energy that shapes the substance of life into
symbols of eternity.
Now, whatever the academicians may say
(and they have said much) about the meta-
physics of poetry, your true poet never for-
gets that his soul is but “the centre of this
sinful earth.” He sings the nuptials of
sense and spirit. In other words, a poet is
a poet by virtue of his power to seize upon
sensation and translate it into images of pas-
sionate aspiration. This sensuality (or
spirituality, if you prefer it that way) is
the poet’s peculiar birthright, the naturally
quickened condition of his blood. He knows
that the spirit is but an emanation of the
blood, and that all the reflexes, dreams, im-
pulses, love-gestures, ardors, lusts and skyey
enthusiasms by which we live are temporal
manifestations of the oneness of all desire.
This sensual apprehension—or vitality of
consciousness—must beget a body for every
spiritual experience; for the mental sub-
stance of the image is to poetry what the
body is to the inhabiting spirit. When the
imagery is rich and passionate, the life of
poetry is begotten; when it is feeble, the
result, however prettily curled and dressed,
is anaemic verse, devoid of spirit and the
progenitive power of mind. Almost any six
lines by Shakspeare, our “man of men,” will
show with what powerful hands he grasps
life, kindling it to the core. He who pene-
trates the womb of consciousness thereby
fathers poetry. Life must be rebuilt after
the impact of this shattering fire.
Admirers of the learned Dryasdust (author
of “Keats: A Christian in the Making” and
“Shakspeare: A Study in Asceticism”) will
want to know exactly what the word “re-
built” signifies in this connection. And I
suppose it will be necessary to amplify what
should be a sufficient answer—that the
poet’s intense sympathy with life and his
constructive vision enable him to purge and
re-create his experience in terms of passion
and beauty. Indeed, there can be no other
definition of a poet. Prince of egotists, it
is for him above all others that the visible
world exists.
But what is the visible world? (Let us
join hands for a moment with Dryasdust in
a glissade into metaphysics.) Conceivably,
a chair, a table, a coffin and a fiddle might
be made of the wood of one tree. But what
is a tree? Is it, as in scientific terms, a for-
tuitous cohesion of atoms; or, as philosophy
declares, an episode in the universal con-
fluence of Becoming; or is it a significant
arrangement in concrete values of light, as
the painter sees it? Nobody knows. In-
deed, you may read in these smothering poly-
syllables a defence of our poor besieged wits:
for the absolute existence of the phenomenal
world cannot be proved. There is no sound
where there is no ear. There is no land-
scape, but “a state of soul,” as Amiel said.
Man will never get outside of life: he is but
a factor in the world-process, a prisoner
within the sorry limits of cognition ; and the
totality of knowledge is beyond his grasp
forever.
Happily, the poet qua poet is not con-
cerned with this vain pursuit of the absolute.
He takes his world as he finds it-~-i.e., as
the material of imagery. Suppose one
says that the chair on the other side
of the room is a “Windsor” chair, he
gives some hint of its design; but
nothing more. But if, with a poet’s eye to
the suggested pathos of its outstretched
arms —as if yearning for her to return to its
lap^—he sees it as “the yearning chair,” lie has
produced something out of nothing. “Chair,”
that was “tree” and will soon be “dust,” is
now a creation of his mind, adjunctive to his
nature and endowed with the essential prop-
erty of his individuality. The bare term
“Windsor chair” is, therefore, of scarcely
more significance in mental values than a
hieroglyph; the proper resources of prose
could do no more than provide the literal
and worthless wood with the upholstery of
description; but the phrase “the yearning
chair,” contributing as it does to the defini-
tion of an emotional state of mind, passes
at once into poetry.
Hence the chameleon poet is of necessity a
monstrous egotist; and although Keats de-
clares that his love of the visible world robs
him of his identity and that his name is writ-
ten in water, he is none the less deliberate
and positive in insisting upon this selfsame
identity. “Pride and egotism,” he said,
“will enable me to write finer poetry than
anything else could, so I will indulge it.”
But if poetry were merely “the best words
in the best order” where would be the sense
of cultivating the ego with a view to sur-
passing “Endymion”; and how could one
ascend thereby to the level of the Odes, where
every word is weighted with significance and
made alive by that sensual ecstasy which is
the pulse and spirit of poetry?
ADRIAN LAWLOR.
Furnley Maurice
The artist, especially in Australia, treads
a thorny path. It therefore bespeaks no
small amount of grit, no small tenacity to a
lofty ideal, that we find Frank Leslie Thom-
son Wilmot (Furnley Maurice), though still
a man of but 42 whose business interests lie
another way, with eight worthy books to his
credit, in addition to a one-act play, “The
Disturber of the Pools,” recently and suc-
cessfully produced in Melbourne. It says
not a little for “the vernal impulsion that
makes lyrical all that has language” that
this man not only writes his books but also
as a hobby helps to print them.
I recall how, while still a boy myself, I
read Wilmot’s first book, published when he
was only 22. It was 10 years before he
broke silence again, this time anonymously,
with a slim volume of “Unconditioned Songs.”
In it one sees the essential optimism—not
the shallow glozing over of facts, but the deep
belief in the fundamental wholesomeness of
human nature —that characterises all his best
work. On the first page he states his
Credo:—
The gods have made the measure
Of evil and of good,
And no man may he treasure
The pleasure that he would.
So go and take your going,
And praise the way you go:
If you work long enough
If you work strong enough,
If you work well enough,
Someone will know.
These are brave words, but they are equalled
by the brave outlook and intellectual clarity
of the man.
He is essentially a lyrical poet, and,
though at times he aims at the philosophical
and even the didactic, as in “Ways and
Means,” it would be as a lyrical poet that
he would be remembered were he —which
Apollo forbid!—to cease writing verse now.
Take, for example, these two flawless lyrics,
the first from “Unconditioned Songs,” the
second from “Arrows of Longing” :
There grows a white, white flower
By the white Alps of romance;
And who would reach its dainty leaves
Takes life and death in chance.
There is a dark, dark cavern
Where a woman goes alone,
Takes hope and peril in her hand,
And fights Death on his throne.
To our heart’s breathless calling
She comes from the cavern wild,
Holding in her exhausted arms
A small, white, blossoming child.
How sincere, how unforced, how spontane-
ous ! And this :
Give me rivers to cool my hands,
Give me the hills for stay,
I have a fear an’ a little fear
I hurt my love to-day.
There was no word, only those eyes
Looked dim with smothered pain ;
A little thing an’ a little thing,
But it breaks my heart in twain!
Could you subtract or add a word without
loss?
“In “The Bay and Padie Book” one can see
how the coming of his own children has deep-
ened and strengthened the writer’s under-
standing of the great human mystery. Fol-
lowed “Eyes of Vigilance”; and Furnley
Maurice entered an assured place in Aus-
tralian letters. It is interesting to note that
here in Australia, where the lamp of culture
might be much better trimmed, it is to
Spenser, the poets’ poet, that Furnley
Maurice turns in a “proem” of real beauty.
He attains, too, to a certain Spenserian
quality in addressing the Elizabethan:—
Treader of the sun,
You have sung sweetly, towered and dreamed and
done....
You know full well life’s indolence and pain,
Man’s rich delights and man’s uncertain faiths,
The gullies rocked and verdurous where frail
Mite birds in their invisible flutterings sail,
Cool lusciousness of peaches washed in rain,
And the dejection of the lonely hours.
In this book one feels that Furnley Maurice
is conscious of a definite message to man-
kind. Read the stinging scorn of “White-
wash” and “To a Hedger” and “To Whom
It May Concern.” See his hatred of war in
“For Valor” :—•
You’ll march with songs of Fatherland
To fatherlands you’ll wreck ;
You’ll shout with splendid valor
With your heel on valor’s neck;
You’ll kiss your baby children
And you'll kiss your weeping wives,
And march away to blast and burn
A million babies’ lives.
But the greatest thing in the book of “Moral
and Divine Songs” is “To God: From the

Warring Nations.” I do not think at
greatest poem written in Australia.
distinction belongs I b ® h ® v
O’Dowd’s “The Bush.” But I do think that
for high seriousness, worthy expression and
weight of thought it will always be ranked
very high amongst the longer poems written
in Australia: —
We cannot fight for ever; when the domes
Of Truth’s avoided temple surely gleam
Above wrecked cities and forsaken homes,
Wen will desert the battle for the dream—
For dreams are stronger than armies m the end.
If that be true —and every true poet believes
it then Purnley Maurice will have done his
share in hastening the day when the swords
will be beaten into ploughshares and the
spears into pruning-hooks. . .
I have left myself little space in which to
speak of that sumptuous volume, Arrows ot
Longing.” It is a noble quarto, limited to
200 copies and containing over 100 large
pages of significant work. The poet says, m
“A Seraph Descends” :
And if you fail me now,
Misjudge me or misread,
I have nowhere to go
And wander lone indeed.
I do not think that the poet need have any
deep-seated fear. Probably the noblest poem
in the book is “The Last of the Kings. It
has something of the same effect on one tnat
Nicholas Vachel Lindsay’s “General William
Booth enters Heaven” has, but I find great
qualities that Lindsay’s poem lacks; —
I know that there are powers beyond Thee, Lord,
Stronger than Thee whom I adore
In calm omnipotence or cold defeat — . l
Let me come back to Heaven to die with the God
I love!
Let the hound come home,
Although the home way must adventure Hell!
Give me the cup ; , ,
Damnation’s pinions bring me home at last
To kiss the pale hands of God, my Master, my King,
Dead of a broken heart,
Knowing His fashioned systems,
The flowing stars down-rushing,
The careless souls down-rushing,
Heed no longer His law and move through His pas-
tures away.
We can but hope that the author will give
us yet more of such splendid speech.
ALEX. C. WELSH.
Rhymes for Children
Ruby Lipscombe Taylor (R.P. 24/4/ 24)
is on the right track, but she takes too long
strides. The kiddies can’t keep up with
her. Australian sentiment, certainly, we
want; but it must be expressed simply. The
jingles may be on any subject —except fairy
stories. Fairy stories will not pass current
in a country that never had any fairies of
its own and allowed its only mystery, the
bunyip, to die of unbelief. Children play
singing games instinctively, but as their
vocabulary is limited, words of more than
two syllables are ineligible. A good while
ago the Red Page ran a competition for Aus-
tralian Nursery Rhymes. Every one of
those published should have been adopted by
our Education Department for inclusion in
the School Papers. Do you mind if I
quote a few?
What are you doing,
O little grey bear?
What are you chewing,
O little grey bear?
Sitting on mother’s back
Having a ride,
Eating the gumleaves
Among which you hide.
You are so happy
A-hiding up there ;
Can baby come up to you,
Little grey bear?
That’s a pretty good one; but how is this for
Australian flavor? —
Little Ji-ka Ji-ka,
All the darkies like her
In her dainty Sunday dress and pinny.
Give her wattle-blossom
And a joey ’possum—
She’s a good Australian piccaninny.
She lives outside Benalla
With her father, Doutta Galla,
Who eats snakes for breakfast till he’s pale;
He kills them with a waddy
And devours them head and body,
And little Ji-ka Ji-ka eats the tail.
Or this one :
There was a little rabbit
That was hiding in his burrow
When the dingo came and told him
To expect him there to-morrow.
But the rabbit thought he’d rather
That the dingo didn’t meet him;
So he found another burrow,
And the dingo didn’t eat him.
Or these: —
Muster, muster, all of a cluster,
Bring in the sheep to be shorn;
Bluster, fluster, southerly buster,
Poppity’s pants are torn.
Little Billy Bandicoot
For potatoes loves to root;
Eats them till his skin is tight
All the long black foggy night.
This one gained the first prize:—
The man from Menindie was counting sheep,
He counted so many he went to sleep.
He counted by threes and he counted by twos,
The rams and the lambs and the wethers and ewes;
He counted a thousand, a hundred and ten—
And when he woke up he’d to count them again.
No mention in these of meadows, brooks,
snow in December, or June. roses! . Neither
are they parodies of English classics. Ot
Mrs. Taylor’s efforts “Little Jack Hacket
could be made most dramatic; but the
“Rhyme of Mushrooming” must be returned
for revision. “Hastened o’er the grass,
“swinging in the breeze,” ‘‘earthy mush-
rooms,” “drowsy cows unheeding,” “the fad-
ing of the latest star,” and “clusters more
arise to greet my sight,” “until the call of
night”—nil are phrases well over a Nursery
Rhyme. Child’s head.
Be simple, lady. If you can, be clever.
Choose easy words. Not teasers ten breaths long.
So make your rhymes, each one to last forever
A real kid’s song.

The True Universal Language
In a recent Red Page an Esperantist made
some derogatory remarks about my mentality
because, among other things, I said that
English, once it discarded its impossible
orthography, had a better chance of becom-
ing the universal “pidgin” than any of the
“ a
Hsh together, a Parsee from Madras and a
4ikh from the Nor’-West frontier conversing
in what they believe is the same tongue, and a

° f fact 1 that Esperanto is taught in the
schools of many European couMries importe
nothing- German and French have been
tau°ht for generations in Australian schools,
and how often do we meet an Australian
capable even of asking his way to the iieares
soda-fountain in either language ? I have had
to find my way about m a good many lan
and while mv expression of helplessness
fn a crowd of the native-born constantly
elicited from a bystander the inquiry Do
you perhaps speak English? I have "ever
been asked if I knew Esperanto. I am well
aware that Volapuk and Ido have been dis-
placed by Esperanto, but I also know that a
nprfeotlv natural tendency exists even
amongst the Esperantists towards schism and
secession Not so long ago an American
“professor”' announced that Esperanto was
scientifically defective, and proposed to pro
duce an entirely new and better brand.
What was the fate of his sedition I do no
know- but the fact that such a tendency
exists’will always “ake the
learning a language which at a y
may be relegated to the rank of a mere dm
lect. If the Esperantist can assist in break

cross this many-tongued, . muddle-headed
nlanet everyone will wish him well, but
fear his efforts are only adding fresh eon-
fusion to the chaos that exists already The
neutrality of Esperanto is allegedas a point
in its favor. But to me that appears its
greatest weakness; crusades were never won
bv anything of the neuter gender. lne
gradual sprfad of English over the globe has
the appearance of an inevitable process that
nothing can prevent but the simultaneous
destruction of the two great branches of the
Anglo-Saxon race. It is a process which
easier spelling would certainly accelerate.
FENG-SHUI.
Blasco Ibanez
Ibanez’s latest novel, La R ei n a Calafia,
bears witness to that falling off in dep ,
spontaneity and artistic value which bega
with his “Los Enemigos de la Mujer. |c
Ts a modern adaptation of .a weansotne o d
legend taken from an anment and obscure
hook of chivalry. Ibanez is still the born
storyteller, still the master of the technique of
the novel, but the freshness andonginality of
his earlier works are lacking. As Baquertb .
Spanish critic, aptly has it, he put his
whole soul into his first books, in lus later
ones he seems to stand outside them like an
SrionTfact that in. proportion to
the spread of Ibanez’s popularity abroad his
reputation as a writer in his own country
diminishes. The best literary critics of
Spain no longer recognise m his work the
artistic value of his earlier regional romances
—masterpieces like “La Barraca, La hate-
dwd ” “La Bodega. His later novels, say
these critics are written for effect, written to
S And they do sell: the Spanish editions
alone run into one and a half million copies,
not counting South American Piracies hov-
tunately the critical acumen of Spanish liter
arv men has become much too refined ot
recent years to permit of their mistaking
popular success for literary merit.
To the disfavor into which he has fallen
with the literary elite of his countrymen, the
ostentation of Ibanez’s life since he attained
success has contributed not a little. He has
become a kind of literary nabob, living. m
sumptuous villas, driving about m luxurious
motor-cars; in short, he has fallen a victim
to vainglory. Quite human, quite natural
no doubt, but a risky experiment in a coun-
try with an age-long reputation for seeing
the ridiculous side of things, and m which
the “new rich” are always unpopular. Again,
certain vainglorious statements made by the
popular author to interviewers, and scattered
by wire and wireless to all quarters of the
globe have stimulated the Spanish sense of
the burlesco, and excited inevitable satirical
comments. . ~ ~
In spite of all this, Ibanez will continue
to flourish (he is said to have five new novels
in preparation) ; the literary atmosphere of
to-day is saturated with reclame. Cost fau
tutti: they all do it—with rare exceptions.
E. J. H.
A Satchel of Books
The Ivory Raiders, by Major Ravne, 0.8. E., M.C.
(Heinemann). A well-written narrative of opera-
tions against recalcitrant natives and breakers of
the game laws in Central Africa to the north-west
of Kenya Colony. Interspersed in the story of hard
marching and some stiff fighting there are admirable
native character-studies and vivid impressions of the
white men who take everything that comes to them
in this 'outlandish country as all in the day s work.
Wandering in China, by Harry A. Franck (Fisher
Unwin). An overloaded account of journeymgs in
Korea Manchuria, Mongolia and Central China that
would’ have needed much sub-editing to bring it to
the standard of the author's ‘‘Vagabonding Down
the Andes” There is plenty of good material, but
too much Franck—his over-drawn criticisms of every-
thing in the way of native customs and methods
that personally inconvenience him would bore a hard-
bitten traveller to tears. And a suburban outlook
exasperates the reader. His repeated shocked refer-
ences to the bare breasts of Korean women suggest
that he might profitably do a little exploring on
western civilisation before his next incursion into
primitive society.
The Wickerwork Woman, by Anatole France (John
Lane). This is the latest of the excellent edition
that John Lane is putting out at half a crown a
volume. The translation is by M. P. Willcocks.
Poirot Investigates, by Agatha Christie (John
Lane). Hercule Poirot is Sherlock Holmes Gallicised.
His feats are set forth in 11 stories which would be
more readable and just as convincing without his
tiresome “Epatants!” Cent tonerres !” “Eh biens,
and so on.
On Life and Letters, by Anatole France (Jonn
Lane). Twenty-one studies of literary and historical
figures, ranging from Guy de Maupassant to Cleo-
patra and the Emperor Julian, by the only authentic
Master that France has to-day. The English trans-
lation has been admirably done by Bernard Miall.
Village and Town Life in China, by Y. K. Leong
and L. K. Tao (Allen and Unwin). A work designed
to give foreigners an idea of the social organisations
of China, and particularly of the relation m which
the Chinese family stands to the State, or rather to
the town, which is the principal unit of government.
Two important chapters deal with the influence 01
Buddhism on Chinese culture.
Our Ostriches, by Marie Stopes, D.Sc Ph.D.
( Putnam’s). Dr. Stopes has won tame and fortune
as a writer on birth-control (over 400 000 copies
have been sold of “Married Love” alone), and this
is an attempt to sheet home her message to humanity
in the form of a play. It was produced m London
at the end of* last year, but is the type of work that
reads better than it acts. The ostriches are those
who refuse to accept the writer’s view that it is
immoral to produce diseased or superfluous children.
The Letters of Charles Creville and Henry Reeve,
edited by Rev. A. H. Johnson, M.A. (Fisher
Unwin). Most of these letters are from GreviUe,
one of the best letter-writers that ever lived. They
are full of the gossip of the governing classes of
the early part of Victoria’s reign, much of it trivial,
some of historical value. What Renan called the
usual frivolity of well-established aristocracies is
much in evidence. The statesmen always appear to
be hunting, shooting or at Newmarket and it is
mentioned that Palmerston’s crnnment on the handing
over to the U.S.A. of the region south of Vancouver
was that “England was d —d if it wanted a place
where salmon wouldn’t rise to a fly.” There is
added interest to the modern reader in the fact that
during practically the whole of the period covered
(1840-60) France and England were at odds chiefly
over Tahiti and French ambitions m the Levant.
Manv of the judgments on the methods and ethics
of French statesmen might have been written yester-
day of such men as Foch and Poincare.
My Wanderings and Memories, by Lady Norah Ben-
tinck (T. Fisher Unwin). It may be that such books
pay if the writers’ indiscretions are deftly balanced
on the border line of libel and the seasoning of
Attic salt is liberal. In a well got up volume of
95fi pages the writer devotes 100 pages to the
doings of her family before she herself begiM to
“take notice.” After that she notices a great deal
including some matters which we might have expected
one born in the Victorian era would have merely
glimpsed with downcast eyes.. The autobiographical
chapters are prefaced by a vindication of this form
of self-revelation deduced from precedents m the
Prophets of Scripture, the early Saints (quoting St.
Augustine’s “O God, make me chaste—but not yet ),
through the Middle Ages to modern days. Goethe,
Montaigne, Madame Guyon, Madame de Stael, Mane
Bashkirtscheff and so on are called to witness how
excellent a thing it is to turn ones self inside out,
for the inquisition of subscribers to the lending
library, and such of the general public as have money
to burn Lady Norah is a cultivated musician and
has met many others. Paderewski, “the most wonder-
ful pianist in the world,” “shines in congenial societj
and can be witty in five languages. Of Melba m
Dresden: “I in my youthful ardor called on her
with a photograph to be signed. (This, by the

Ruby Lipscombe Taylor: May I say that my refer-
enee to Dennis’s “Glugs of Gosh” (R.P. 24/4/ 24)
was a slip. Of course the reference was to C.J.D. s
delightful “Book ior Kids” —I was stressing the
fact that youngsters like a bit of fun in their rhymes
as well as the prettiness which May Gibbs paints so
well in her Gum-nut Babies.
“C.Me.L.” : A. R. Ward (R.P. l/5/’24) suggests
that 1 had forgotten Pliny’s famous and “authentic”
letter to Trajan when I mentioned that the omission
of any reference to the early Christian maityrs in
Apuleius and other contemporary writers had caused
some people to doubt their existence. But Pliny’s
letter made out a case so unlike the real Roman
Empire as we know it from undoubted Romans, such
as Petronius and Apuleius, that it has been the sub-
ject of fierce controversy. Edwin Johnson said that
the Latin in it was that of a mediaeval monk ;
Salomon Reinach pointed out that the sole authentic
manuscript of it perished unaccountably in the six-
teenth century; and J. M. Robertson was far from
being convinced of its genuineness. But, being a
peaceful person, I did not plunge into these bitter
depths of controversy. I merely asked why, if the
orthodox stories are true, the Romans, when you get
them by themselves away from the Fathers, seem to
know nothing about Christianity. They rather seem
to be worrying about witchcraft and sodomy with
Apuleius and Petronius, or about Venus with both.
And all to be cured by worshipping the Great Mother !

Tyre Making
nnHE development by the United States Rubber Company of
77_„ o! e p rem f r^ ab ‘t processes of rubber manufacture now
any tyre G ° rd r£S 3 quality never before reached by
1. The New Sprayed Rubber. A method so effective that
a virgin rubber ol a quality never known until now is made
available to the world.
. T e New Web Cord. Of Specific application to the art
o cord tyre making. A process of treating fabrics and cords
with latex, making it possible to manufacture tyres and other
articles with a degree of strength hitherto unattained.
3. The New Flat-Rand Building Process. A method of
building cord tyres which is revolutionary. Finally and at
last assuring uniform cushioning and resistance in cord tyres.
Taken alone, either of these new discoveries would be regarded as
ot the utmost significance, but together they are hailed as the most
important advance in the field of rubber manufacture since the
discovery of vulcanization nearly a century ago.
These three basic discoveries fully protected by patents in the

“Over twenty years ago
I purchased a ‘Bosker’ Rug of Gowings’.
Since then it has been a constant and ever-
faithful companion to me in my wanderings
over the length and breadth of Australasia.
It is practically as good now as on the day I
bought it.”
This is an actual instance, and we know
of many other similar cases, proving con-
clusively the quality of Gowings’ Rugs.
The “Bosker” we sell to-day is the same
high-quality rug as it was over twenty years
ago.

excellent quality. This fine Australian rug compares

The Seaside Speaker.
Last night for a moment’s brief space
When the surf in the darkness rang loud,
With the mist of the sea on my face
I stood with a hearkening crowd.
A master of sadness and smiles
Was at work on the mind and the heart,
With the tricks and the gestures and wiles
That are born of the orator’s art.
lie championed a palpitant cause
And spoke of a peril to be,
But ever I heard at each pause
The voice of the dominant sea.
Above him one flickering light
Through the mist and the murkiness
shone.
While away in the depths of the night
The sea in the darkness sang on.
He dwelt with an eloquent voice,
And words that uplifted like wings,
On the hour, and the need, and the choice
And the making and shaping of things.
Though touched were his phrases with grace,
His wit jewel-bladed and free,
I turned, tired of soul, from that place
And hearkened the voice of the sea.
For under the dome of the sky
It sang, betwixt rumble and range,
“The Witness of all things am I,
The Watcher and Weaver of Change!
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
To a Young Poet.
Ret scorners scorn and bitter cynics bite
And force their venom from a broken pen.
They are but old and disappointed men
Who have forgot or never knew the light
Of glowing youth that guides your fresher
sight
And draws you to the conquest. Reave
the rest
To barter in the marts ; and spur the quest
Of only that which beauty has made bright
In this rich land that has as many songs
As Heav’n has stars to whisper m an ear
That love has taught to listen. Voices teem
In all her shining ways. They are as
gongs
Resounding down her shores; and if you hear
Your pen shall sing the songs that others
dream.

CECIL MANN.
The Kiss.
As purposeless as wind-blown leaves we
Kissed
And felt the fusion of the centuries.
Whence did it come, that whiff of orris root !
The clatter of a rapier to the floor?
The brush of lace against my pulsing throat
Where your arm pressed the riot of my blood
Back to my heart? Behind you seemed to
grow .
A chest with dragon feet inlaid with pearl,
A couch, with fleur-de-lis in rusted gold
Upon a pattern delicate in silk,
And oval mirrors thick with cloudy gilt
In fruits and Cupids. I could see your eyes
Blue as the sea; and yet they did not smile.
But I could feel your lips hot as the sun
On apple orchards feeding on my mouth.
You named me queen; yet, looking down, I
saw
Bare feet in wooden sabots and I knew
Those feet were mine, broad, toil-hard,
peasant-bred
That trod too close to earth to know the ease
Of carriage cushions and the ’broidered stool
Milady sets her satin shoon upon.
Reflected in the floor I saw the heels
Of your court slippers. They were poppy-
red;
And diamond garters dipt your hose above
The finer curving of your supple limbs.
And all the while your eyes were blue and
cold!
Muffled beyond the heavy silk-hung walls,
I heard a chiming bell —or did it toll
The passing of life forfeited? There seemed
A monkish chanting and the drowsy scent
Of incense swung in censers o’er a vault —
All strange to me who only knew the smell
Of hot milk spurting in a wooden pail,
The reek of kine, the sweet, wet breath of
grass
And hawthorn hedges. On my clumsy shoes
I saw faint stains of fields and outdoor
things.
Your red heels mocked them in their foppish
grace,
As o’er the beating of responsive hearts
Your blue eyes mocked me with your mouth
on mine.
Two modern people under God’s bright stars,
Above the city, where the jangling trams
Go grating down the blocks, where brass
bands blare
And flags proclaim our town makes holiday;
And that street singer, who has lost an arm
Somewhere in France, shouts an old march-
ing song ,
All out of tune! Two people who have
sought
Refuge in this roof-garden high above
The grimy chimneys where electric signs
Fire all the pale horizons; and there comes
From that dark corner the ripe pungency
Of Mocha coffee! Or a mild cigar
Suggests a lonely soul’s philosophy!
We, parrying serious things, struck mental
sparks,
Foiling each other with intention, till
A moment’s silence forced the secret bar.
I looked up, you looked down; and so we
kissed!
It should have been a trifle to forget;
Yet came that fusion of the centuries
Rushing together. Did three hundred years
Give back a lost kiss that my blood still
holds —
A kiss perhaps with Death the other side!

THE PLAUSIBLE PERSON WITH A
TREATY.
The British Ministry has produced a
“genuine Freetrade Budget,” and Australia
now knows just how it is situated with re-
gard to the parent whom it has been en-
deavoring to bring up by hand. It will get
no further consideration in return for the
very large preference which it gives to
British goods, and by which it has sacrificed
as much as £8,750,000 of revenue in one
year an amount that would have been very
handy for paying off some of its debts or
shouting itself a naval base. It will lose
the abjectly small scrap of preference which
Britain already allows it concession worth
about £75,000 per annum in the shape of
reduced duty on gum-leaves or some such
vegetable. And if Australia continues to
give a preference on the present conditions
to British goods to the detriment of its own
manufactures, it will be flooded with more
and still more Hun and other foreign stuff
disguised as British, for anything which
comes into John Bull's islands three parts
made by alien labor, and is finished there,
or is certified to be finished there, may come
to this country as pure BuLL-made, and get
extensive exemption from the tariff as such.
The decision of the Ramshackle Ministry
to abolish the anti-dumping law, which had at
least some trifling value, will leave the British
market absolutely open, and the U.K. will be
more than ever a mere wayside station on the
road to the Commonwealth. A Protectionist
U.K. might have the whole job of manufac-
turing for Australia most of those things
which it doesn’t yet make for itself, but its
Ministry prefers to be Freetrade and have a
quarter of the job, with a near chance of
losing that.
In these unsatisfactory circumstances
Prime Minister Bruce shows signs of a
tendency to negotiate a preference treaty with
Canada, and take it on as a partner instead
of Britain. But that idea, as matters stand,
is no good either. Canada is largely a branch
establishment of the big neighbor from which
it is separated by a chalk-line across the
prairie. A commercial treaty with it might
almost as well be one with Uncle Sam him-
self. Canada and Uncle are Australia’s two
supremely bad customers. In 1920-21 the
pair sold us goods to the value of over
£40,500,000, bought from us merchandise
worth a little over £10,000,000, and held out
a persuasive paw for the difference in cash.
Things are not often on so big a scale as
that, but they are always like that. The two
bad customers are so pleased with the
arrangement that, while it lasts, any conces-
sion they are likely to offer would be of
small value. It would strike them as ridiculous
to buy trade at any big price when they have
it already. The wiser course for us would
be to leave off the preference game entirely
for a while, put 12 more tiers of bricks on
top of our tariff wall, and cut down imports
in a drastic fashion ; and then take six bricks
off in the case of any nation which offered
adequate favors in exchange. And negotia-
tions should be opened on strictly Dutch
principles, except perhaps in the case of
places like France and Italy, whose trade
shows a handsome balance in our favor.
The extent to which the Commonwealth has
failed and is failing to make its fortune by
foreign trade is little realised. The last
Whitaker’s Almanack includes the import-
ing statistics of the Old Man in London as
recently as 1922. It gives the principal
places of origin of 53 different kinds of food
and other raw materials which he buys
abroad, and it is remarkable in how very
few cases Australia is the principal source of
supply, or is even considered worth mention-
ing as a source of any sort. It scored one
first place: it supplied not very far short of
half the entire purchases of wool. It had a
pitiably bad second for chilled and frozen
beef, the Australian record being less than
£2,000,000 compared with Argentina’s
£16,600,000. It had three thirds —for butter,
flour and mutton; and three fourths —for
wheat, cheese and oleo-margarine. Compared
with Argentina, which had four first places,
and Canada, which had three, Australia
looked almost like a non-starter. It got a
mention for leather, copper and pig lead, but
these were classed among manufactures. In
fact, this country, apart from its w r ool, seems
to have failed to make a serious impression
on the Old Man as a great and essential
supplier of “primary products,” and he appa-
rently thinks that, save for wool, he could
get on quite well without it, and would
hardly notice if it dropped out of the family,
l’erhaps, if the preference or one-sided reci-
procity agreement is cancelled suddenly, he
may wake up to the knowledge that there is
a continent in these latitudes.
* * * *
Agriculture, except to meet local demands
and for a little trading with adjacent coun-
tries, is a very moderate business in Aus-
tralia, and is slow to take root. The European
market is too far off, and no kind of treaty
will bring it any nearer. The year 1921-22
was a good average year in N. S. Wales
(almost exactly bushels to the acre),
and the local Statistician reckoned that the
toiler who reaped 230 acres for grain, which
is plenty for one man to do, and sold it at
the equivalent of its value in the English
market, made 41s. lid. per week net for his
labor. If Australia could be moved as near
to the British market as Canada is, he ought
by the saving in freight to have made 88s.
"d. per week, unless some one swindled him
out of the saving. And suppose the country
concentrated on manufactures, for which it
is well fitted, and resolved to make for itself
practically everything its fast-increasing
population could want —if it brought the cus-
tomer to the wheat instead of sending it to
him —the same farmer should, as a matter of
bald figures, have made 101 s. 3d. per week net
from his farm in that year. When Australia
got beyond supplying itself and some adjacent
countries, and began to depend on the Euro-
pean market, its agriculture became pre-
carious. Now even the most reckless and
lavish expenditure of loan money on “settle-
ment” devices and the most lavish subsidising
of the -wheat crop with minimum railway
charges _ lead to no visible permanent in-
crease m the cultivated area. It seems.
perfectly obvious that increase of a pros-
perous agricultural population is wholly, or
almost wholly, dependent on the ipcrease
of a prosperous manufacturing population;
wherefore the plausible stranger with a beam-
ing smile on his countenance and a reci-
procity treaty in his pocket should not be
embraced at the first time of asking.
THE PETULANCE OF MR, BRUCE.
Prime Minister Bruce, who specialises in
unemotionalism, betrayed the first symptoms
of a tendency to get rattled the other day.
His disappointment at the fate of his pre-
ference proposals was understandable; but
there was no justification for petulance,
much less threats. The defects of Mr.
Bruce as a leader have been evident almost
from the beginning; but they have had the
merit of being the product of some of his
best qualities. His don’t-give-a-damn atti-
tude towards both politics and office has been
taken as a proof of integrity and indepen-
dence. In a sense, it no doubt is. But he
happens to be able to afford such luxuries,
apart from ethical considerations. And
rightly or wrongly he has always managed to
give an impression that he looks on his pre-
sent job as an affair which, unless carefully
watched, may have a lowering effect on the
status of one who is an ex-officer and a
° f bridge and a
.acting figure m the commercial world. This
lias been implied variously, but for the most
part by an attitude of chill aloofness to-
wards the rank and file of his Parliamentary
followers, and towards pressmen who, like
other helots, are often king-makers and un-
makers in a crisis. All this may be but
proper pride; yet many have inevitably mis-
taken it for something less admirable. The
net result is that he suffers by comparison
with his. often objectionable and abusive, but
always intensely human and humorous, pre-
decessor as a winner of popular affection. If,
in addition to his temperamental coldness,
his disposition to be at all times as exclusive
and correct as we may be sure he was while
pacing the Leander Club lawn at Henley, he
lets himself grow testy and excitable when
difficulties arise, the way will be clear for
his supersession by W. M. Hughes, which
would be a far greater calamity to Australia
than to Mr. Bruce.
* * * *
There never has been a time when it was
easier for an _ Australian Prime Minister to
select a definite line and stick to it. The
tariff issue has been disposed of: there are
no Freetraders left of the sort that once
made the political lives of men like Deakin
and Kingston miserable. The disrupting
old State Bights cry is heard no more. The
Labor Opposition has been manoeuvred by
misguided supporters and by traitors within
its gates into one false position after an-
other. Apart from its association with Com-
munism, Red Flagism and other moujik
notions which are alien to the sober, indivi-
dualistic genius of the Australian toiler, the
party has been committed, through its leader,
to a suicidal attitude on the defence ques-
tion. Matthew Charlton has successively
proclaimed that he and his following pro-
pose _to “knock out compulsory military
training” ; to forbid an expeditionary force,
even of volunteers, to leave Australia again
before a general referendum of the Common-
wealth shall have authorised the step ; and
to spend nothing whatever on capital ships,
cruisers or bases for their accommodation.
The international position is such that those
Australians who are unable to trust in the
disastrous economics of Moscow and in the
continued pacifism of the hungriest, most
congested and most militaristic part of the
world to-day, must turn towards Britain.
It is profitless to recriminate, to blame Bri-
tain, because its Little England, and, to an
extent, internationalist Labor party has run
true in office to the form it displayed over
and over again when on the other side of
the House. The gambit is to substitute for
futile and undignified protests a few words
of approval for the efforts of our many
friends in the U.K., and to proceed
to make the best of the altered state
of affairs. Here circumstances at home and
abroad have combined remarkably to sim-
plify the Prime Minister’s problem. His
opponents discountenance any defence policy
(unless their chatter of a last-minute im-
provisation of armies and arms is to be
admitted as such), so he must produce one.
Defence for Australia is primarily a matter
of guarding sea-lines of communication, and
the unit of power in the ocean through which
these lines run is the battle-cruiser mounting
15in. guns or over. We have no such ship,
and under the Washington agreement may
not start building one for nine years. In
other words, our only hope of real security
lies in co-operating with Britain at sea as
we co-operated on sea and land during the
World War. In addition to being the only
strategical way, it is the cheapest way, and
the way that has already been tried and
found effective.
* * * *
Such is the simple gospel of which Mr.
Bruce must be the prophet—either that or
he must hand over the burdqn of his anti-
Labor Prime Ministership to a less reluc-
tant Titan. It bears with it the necessity
of a gesture towards the debt- and unemploy-
ment-harassed United Kingdom very different
from that which was represented by his
recent threat to trade with Canada (which
usually means the U.S.A.) as a protest
against the Macdonald Government’s re-
pudiation of the preference principle. As
British Labor looks at it, preference to opu-
lent Australia amounts to greasing the fat
pig. British Laborites, who are largely
bourgeois, and their Liberal allies, who are
almost all bourgeois, recall a little bitterly
that they and their fathers and grandfathers
have been taxed heavily for the defence of
this country. It was not so bad when trade
was booming; qnd not wholly unendurable
when Britain’s rivals began to protect their
home markets, with fatal effects on some of
the U.K.’s biggest industries. But now, with
a frightful collection of domestic problems
(housing, poor relief, etc.), the obligation
to pay America £5,000,000 every month in
gold and the newly-arisen need to build up
to an aeroplane as well as a naval strength,
the plight of taxpayers of all grades is
becoming desperate. They want no rebukes
on the score of meanness from us, and de-
serve none._ On the contrary, what Austra-
lian politicians might advantageously do is to
indicate that the Dominions will welcome the
day when the U.K. takes its courage in both
hands and adopts the fiscal policy that has
brought wealth to its industrial rivals. This
is not the self-denying ordinance it may look
at a glance. The more prosperous Britain is
the safer, if not the richer, the Common-
wealth must be, and Mr. Bruce is just the
man to drive the point home. As an imita-
tor and friend, however transitory and half-
hearted, of those disgruntled profiteers who
would gladly Americanise this country for
a ha’porth of extra Yankee trade, he is right
out of the picture.
THE MOTHER AND THE LAW.
In long past years the British father drew
his strength from the masterly body of the
civil law. It was handed to him by the Con-
queror, as a gift from classic Rome, so that
what remains of his rights have at least a
decent genealogical tree. The patria potes-
tas of the early Roman was a full-blooded
power, very different from the anaemic thing
of to-day. In those glorious days a parent
could put his child to death, or sell him
for so many denarii in the public market.
Though in later days he lost these powers,
yet always he ruled his household with a rod
of iron. The spirit of this potestas long sur-
vived in English law. By the common law
of the land the father had the right to the
custody of his child against the world —even
against the mother, “though the child be an
infant at the breast”—and this right was
upheld through centuries. In the days of
the younger Pitt, and during the Napoleonic
wars, one De Manville, an alien enemy,
married an English woman, they both being
domiciled in England. Not long after the
marriage the couple separated, the wife keep-
ing the child—which she was nursing—with
her. Subsequently, on a bitterly cold night
in April, the father broke into the house
where she was living, took the child from
her breast and carried it, almost naked, in
an open carriage, to his own residence. The
mother applied to the Court to have her baby
restored to her as, she said, it had been torn
from her with a view of taking it to some
remote part of the kingdom or to France.
This ground was not supported, and the case
then turned wholly on the question of the
father’s right to the custody of the child.
Lord Ellenborough, C.J., whose judgment
was concurred in by Lawrence, J., held that
the father was, at law, the person so en-
titled. If he abused that right to the detri-
ment of the child the Court would protect
the latter. In this case, however, there was
no pretence that the child had been injured
by want of nurture or in any other respect.
It was then by direction of the Court handed
to the father.
Even where an ante-nuptial contract had
been entered into between the parties to a
projected marriage stipulating that the
mother should have the control of the child-
ren of the union, the Court refused to enforce
it on the ground that such a contract was
“against public policy.” The position of the
mother was that during the lifetime of her
husband she was “entitled to no power, but
only to reverence and respect.” On the death
of the father —without having appointed a
testamentary guardian—she became entitled
to the custody of her infant children, and was
their guardian by “nature and nurture.”
“Nature” and “Nurture,” ministering angels
of the mother, had no recognition during the
father’s lifetime.
The times changed, and slowly the courts
with them. The principle upon which, in
Common law or Equity, the Judges acted
was that in regulating the relations of the
parents to the child it should be ensured that
the custodian was “a wise, affectionate and
careful parent.” The dominant- matter for
the consideration of the Court was “the moral
welfare of the child.” Nevertheless the
father had the first claim to his offspring,
and it took something very substantial in the
way of immorality to wrest from him his
ancient patria potestas. “Occasional intem-
perance” and even adultery, if he were care-
ful not to bring the child “into contact with
his mistress,” outbursts of violent passion
and so forth, were not sufficient grounds to
warrant the Court in interfering with his
control. Poverty and insolvency, those un-
happy twins, also did not furnish a sufficient
charge. Even the weapon of religion could
not prevail, unless he were so indiscreet as
to embody in his creed, or want of it, prin-
ciples stamped by the law as “vicious and
immoral.”
Still the law had watered down the auto-
cratic power of the father: there was a great
advance on the days when he could murder
his child or traffic in its body. The judicial
machine was gradually shifting over from
the rights of the father to the welfare of the
child, and, incidentally, to some considera-
tion of the mother —at least, she could be
judicially noticed. It was not, however, till
. early in the Victorian age that the parental
tyrant really “got it in the neck.” An Act
was passed to qualify the unwritten law.
The Common law rights of the father were
made subject to the discretionary power of
the courts. He got “his rights,” or he did
not, as the Courts, within certain restric-
tions, thought fit. The mother humbly re-
ceived some crumbs from the judicial table.
The Court, having looked her over and heard
her character, could give her the custody of
her children up to seven and later on up to
16 years of age. Probably they were handed
over with a homily for her benefit.
Over 30 years later the discretionary
power of the courts was still further wid-
ened, till now only the shreds and tatters of
his once proud vesture of authority remain
to the father. English law has gone so far
that the Court must even take into considera-
tion “the wishes of the mother,” though, of
course, they do not necessarily prevail. The
mother has been given a place at the table,
but she cannot order the fare. Whether the
child shall have roast beef with the father
or chocolate meringues with the mother is
still for the Court to say. We have not
gone quite so far generally in Australia,
though broadly we follow English legisla-
tion. In all the legislation, here and oversea,
the one outstanding feature is “the interests
of the child.” In its quest for these interests
the Court does not hesitate to over-ride any
obstacles put in its way. It will sweep away
a covenant in a deed of separation, if in its
opinion that covenant is not in the child’s
interests. In the notable case of Mrs. Annie
Besant, in days when she was a disciple of
Charles Bradlaugh, her husband, the Rev.
Frank Besant, set his hand and seal to a
deed of separation. This deed contained a
covenant giving his wife the custody of their
little daughter. The couple separated, but
a little while afterwards he approached the
Court alleging that his wife held and pro-
mulgated atheistic opinions, and refused to
allow the child to receive any religious in-
struction. He further alleged "that she had
published a certain obscene book —the very
book, by the way, that in a N. S. Wales court
has been declared to be pure and undefiled—
and the English Court held that “to bring
up a child in the religion of the father was
a duty the Court owed to its ward” (the
child having in the meantime, by the due
payment of fees, been made a ward of Court),
“and was unaffected by the covenant in the
deed”; also “that the refusal of religious in-
struction to the child and the publication of
the obscene book were in themselves suffi-
cient grounds for removing her from the cus-
tody of the mother.”
Summed up the position is this—the
alleged rights of the father, the wishes,
the “divine feelings” and the “inner work-
ings” of the mother do not count against
“the interests of the child.” Verily, youth
has come into its own—and father's nose
has been pushed to the grindstone.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Coming to Earth.
A good many military authorities have ex-
pressed the opinion that the hnal defeat of
the great Napoleon was due to his tactical
mistakes in the field. With all his instinc-
tive knowledge of strategy on the great scale,
and his fine military imagination, he was not
very sure about detailed movements. This
is accounted for by his lack of practice in
that part of the game. He at a
bound from a minor place in the French
artillery to the command of an army; and
the sort of early experience that stoodso well
to Wellington had never been his. W e are in
some danger of meeting our Waterloo from the
very same cause. Our modern man is pro-
moted at a bound from a careless and little
instructed infancy to the full handling of
forces of which he has not the slightest de-
tailed knowledge. For a payment of money
we set electric currents flashing our words
round the world, bid the same power take us
swiftly home to dinner, or sit listening-in to
something brought from afar by a still more
mysterious application of natural force; yet
no man among us all really knows what that
force is, much less appreciates the full extent
of its possibilities. The rank and file merely
turn the handle and the thing works—blank
ignorance and vicarious' skill combining to
take matters for granted. We live cheer-
fully in great cities whose existence, depends
on a vast network of poisonous sewers, under-
stood by a very few sanitary experts, which
if blocked for 4S hours would fill every street
with disease. We trust someone unknown
to see us through, very much as ancient
nations looked to their gods to murder their
foes and ripen the harvests. These things
constitute a real danger. The claim that
our complex life is based upon a mutual faith
and trust, which is the highest thing pro-
gress has developed, breaks down on a close
examination. We do not possess a real
faith; we merely gamble on the chance of
pulling through. There are dangers which
which we know and dangers which we
do not know; and we take the risks and
go straight on. But there are risks of a
more diffused and general kind which we
need not take, and the avoidance of which
in no way clashes with the general trend of
our development. The thing that seems to
be certainly necessary for our salvation is to
come to earth. Our heads are in the clouds;
the little things that count for almost every-
thing in the long run are escaping us. We
import thousands of motor-cars made by
other hands in other places, and have not
yet contrived to make roads on which they
can be safely driven. We imitate the sky-
scrapers of New York without giving a
moment’s consideration to the fact that we
have plenty of room for less expensive and
more reasonable structures. It takes our
trains longer to get from Sydney to the top
of the Blue Mountains than it did 35 years
ago, and therefore longer to get to the pro-
ductive country at the back; yet George-
street goes higher and higher, as if with
some insane idea that production and national
wealth were to be drawn from the firma-
ment. It is no doubt the unhealthy ex-
pansion of the cities that is most at fault.
As things are going to-day it seems that it
may be necessary for sheer nation-saving to
reduce the franchise of the practical aliens
of the towns as against that of the true
Australians in the places of Australian life
and production; but a live sentiment about
the things that really matter would obviate
such an extreme measure being taken for
national safety.

Thinning Out.
Federal Minister Austin Chapman, who
holds that Australia should run its affairs
with one Government and one Parliament
(at Canberra, in liis own electorate), says
that 50 different bodies, mostly municipal
and shire councils, have burst into applause
at the idea, and others may applaud at any
moment. “A large measure of local self-
government” is the bait held out; but local
self-government can be granted and taken
away again, which makes it too like a Turk-
ish constitution. Meanwhile it is estimated
that the N. S. Wales population is moving
into Sydney at an accelerated pace, because
it is the only capital to move to, and Aus-
tralia has the habit of living in capitals
very badly. It is mostly the young people
who move, consequently the tendency of the
country to become a land of old gaffers and
gammers increases. The State is officially
divided into 14 parts, and of these the 1901
census showed nine to be losing by migra-
tion —raising babies for export, in fact. In
1921 11 sections had got into the same bad
habit. In the TO years 1891-1901 the county
of Cumberland gained 48,480 new settlers,
while the rest of Ma lost 43,257 by de-
parture. That covered the bank-calamity
period, in which immigrants were few and
loans also. But in the 1911-21 decade the
county of Cumberland gained 216,827 folk
by excess of arrivals over departures, and
the rest of Ma lost no less than 82,135 by
excess of departures. Apart from the little
county which holds Sydney, the only two
districts to gain anything by “migrants”
were the Hunter-Manning, where the new
steelworks created some activity (it was on
the losing list in 1901), and Riverina, which
has a sort of capital of its own in Mel-
bourne. Some of the figures were remark-
able :
Gains by Migration (1911-21).
; Cumberland I Hunter-Manning 16,943
County .. 216,827 | Riverina .. 3,844
Losses by Migration.
Central Plain . . 3,677 Central Tableland 9,711
Southern Tableland 4,402 North Tableland 12,884
North Coast .. 4,977 Southern Slope.. 12,886
Northern Plain.. 5,139 Northern Slope.. 14,471
South Coast .. 6,248 Western Division 20,772
Central Slope .. 7,855
In the 1891-1901 decade none of the dis-
tricts sent away so many of their young
people to Cumberland County that the num-
ber of their inhabitants actually diminished,
but in 1901-11 two actually lost popula-
tion (that is, departures and deaths exceeded
arrivals and births), and in 1911-21 three
(Northern Tableland, Northern Slope and
Western Division) were in that graveyard
category. _ From this it looks as if 300,000
square miles is more than can be governed
successfully from one centre, else the fringes
wouldn’t go to seed so definitely; yet Austin
Chapman preaches that 3,000,000 square
miles may be capably managed from one
centre. The idea can only properly be
laughed at.
The Englishman in Australia.
The S. M. Herald published a striking
letter from a member of the crew of the
Repulse last week. The writer said that
he and a number of his shipmates were think-
ing of returning to Australia as settlers at
the end of their time in the R.N., but feared
that “a feeling exists in Australia against
the English.” The Herald could not truth-
fully deny this notorious fact: the best it
could do was to deplore it. What it might
beneficially have done was to present itself
at the penitent’s stool and promise reform.
The Herald has been exploiting England
and the Empire for political purposes for
generations, and the cumulative effect of the
habit pursued all over the Commonwealth
by politicians in search of an issue which
permits of unlimited oratory and calls for
nothing much in the way of performance, has
been to range the Englishman and his coun-
try on the side of reactionaries and hum-
bugs in the minds of thousands. The N. S.
Wales King and Empire Alliance, which is
rarely identified doing anything of practical
value for either King or Empire, though it
makes a deal of party capital out of both,
emerged from its long retirement on the day
the Repulse man's letter appeared with a
resolution “emphatically protesting against
the disloyal action of the delegates at the
Eight-Hour Day celebrations at the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall on Saturday evening
last, as reported in the daily press, in sing-
ing a verse of the ‘Red Flag’ in lieu of the
National Anthem, and more particularly at
the action of several members of the Federal
and State Parliaments in being present and
condoning such disloyalty.” There are thou-
sands of unspectacular yet effective ways in
which a genuine loyalist can work for the
advancement of the Imperial cause. He can
buy British instead of foreign goods. One
of the objects of the Special Service Squad-
ron’s trip round the world is to impress on
the Dominions the necessity of buying more
British motor-cars. He can demand British
films. Some of Australia’s noisiest Empire
patriots have to spend a lot of time ex-
plaining why so much of their money is
behind the importation of Yankee films. He
can give preference to Britishers and Aus-
tralians who have proved their attachment
to the Empire by fighting for it. No worse
turn can be done to King and Empire, on
the other hand, than to drag them periodi-
cally through the mud of party conflict.
A salutary ordinance forbade the use of
“Anzac” for trade purposes: it was recog-
nised that the name would otherwise be
prostituted by an undesirable type of trader.
It is a thousand pities, from the stand-
point of the dynasty and the Empire, that a
similar law was not passed years ago for
their protection. As it is, they have been
taken over as part of the party parapher-
nalia of some of the most impudent political
frauds in the country. And one of the
reactions has been to bring undeserved dis-
like and distrust on Englishmen who are
claimed by most Empire specialists as
peculiarly their own. Once these people
yield up their monopoly as truculent protec-
tors of British institutions which have no
need whatever of their oratory the welcome
of the immigrant Englishman will grow
much warmer. At present his unfortunate
lot is that unless he immediately discloses
himself as a Bolshevik many suspect him of
being a blatant Tory and Jingo.
.
Freetrade in Filth.
The U.S. film-spoilers who prey on this
country to the extent of £750,000 p.a. in
gold must have a low opinion of the Aus-
tralian politician. Not only does he Jet
their million-dollar productions come in at
a peppercorn rate of duty, and make things
easy for such as are minded to dodge the
income-tax, but he can easily be persuaded
to give them cheap advertisements. Their
favorite method of getting the loan of his
leg is to rig up a cinematograph apparatus
at Parliament House for a trial spin of
“Two-Gun Tupper” or “The Bootleggers’
Brides.” Apparently no one in authority
objects to the Legislature being thus de-
graded, although there is tremendous talk on
other occasions about the dignity of Par-
liament. Another way of securing free pub-
licity is to get the Premier or his substitute
to “ ‘open’ the calimpaign this cahmp’ny—
the Sooper-Soopreme cahmp’ny—is lahnehin’
in favor of berrer-’n’-brigliter pitchers.”
At least two Premiers and a num-
ber of Cabinet Ministers have acted
as “spruikers” for Yankee films on
such lines. They must have been grati-
fied at the fruits of their labors when one
of the “berrer-’n’-brigliter” First National
efforts was advertised recently as follows: —
The Screen Sensation of the Year, “Flaming Youth”
—that other book you carry in a brown-paper parcel.
Whoops, m’dear, who cares? Hush! We’ll give
you just one glimpse of the naughty midnight bathing
party.
Just how far can a girl go ?
Hectic parties, indiscretions that would have
killed grandmother, wild week-ends, petting parties,
utter disregard of conventions.
And then she comes to the time for marriage—
temporary marriage.
Should she confess her former loves to her husband
to be ?
It will amaze you with its daring.
“Flapper Wives,” another outcome of the
Hollywood reform movement, of which so
much has been heard, was heralded as under:
Welcome, Flapper Wives of the Screen —you’re the
real thing. You strike us as being just about the
sort of wives Sydney flappers would make. You’ve
the same penchant for cigarette-smoking, cocktail-
supping, joy-riding, jazzing and petting—and, oh,
you flappers in our midst, those of real life- —
you’re going to learn a lot from this, the greatest
drama of a girl’s soul ever filmed!
The worst feature of this prurient rubbish
is its calculated appeal to the imaginations
of the young. Australian girls and lads are
clean-minded, as a rule, but youth is recep-
tive and imitative, and this persistent pro-
paganda of lubricity and ruffianism, the iii-
creasing inculcation of the idea that it is
the whole duty of a young woman to be
idle, inebriated and over-dressed, and of a
young man to be a sex-obsessed loafer,
cowboy or criminal, must have its effects.
So the familiar paragraphs about the little
girl who stabbed her brother “the way they
do it at the pictures,” and the little boy who
went in for burglary a la Shoestring Sam,
are being supplemented by items like the
following:—
At the Ballarat General Sessions a youth was
charged with a serious offence against a girl aged
15. The offence was committed at Ararat in
March. The evidence, which exposed the misbehavior
of a number of boys and girls in a park after
attending a picture-show, revealed a shocking con-
dition of affairs.
Tackled about “Flaming Youth” Chapman,
the Minister of Customs, had to admit that
it “wasn't a picture for the young mind.”
Then, recalling that the atrocity had been
released for exhibition by his incomprehen-
sible censors, he argued that “we can’t rule
out films simply because they are insults to
the intelligence.” Coming from the head of
a department which achieved the distinction
of banning Boccaccio’s “Decameron” this
is the quintessence of humbug. A regular
supply of pictures that wouldn’t be insults
to the imagination, or to Australian senti-
ment and good taste, could be got at a price.
But the price is High Protection, and Chap-
man’s Government, which is all for raising
the tariff wall against imported onions,
almonds and bananas, is a lymphatic
Foreign-trader as regards films.
The Great Pruning-knife War.
James Edmond’s reflections on peace :—-
On Anzac Day I heard an eminently sane parson
preach on peace. He said he was no unreasoning or
morbid whale for disarmament, and didn’t believe in
throwing away all weapons, or at least didn’t believe
in throwing them an immoderate distance, until the
matter has been looked at from all points of view,
the world, beef and the Devil being still opponents
to be reckoned with. I suppose people will fight as
much after the bayonet is boiled down and made
into another article as they do now, only they will
hit each other with the other article. Perhaps they
will fight more, for war will be cheaper, and it
will also be simpler. People won’t have to neglect
their other business so long to qualify. They will
be in the same category as the amateur Cantonese
adventurer, who is said to be generally a clerk in
his business hours, though he is a perfectly capable
pirate on bank holidays and saints’ days. That is
because piracy, as practised in Chow waters, requires
little training and is done with simple, though
bloodthirsty, apparatus. The tendency of real dis-
armament (and the bogus article is hardly worth
discussing) will be to make this world the prey
of the muscular, the ferocious, the bull-doggy and
the thick-headed —and the thick-headed will be the
least objectionable. In older days the highly culti-
vated man and the highly objectionable and beetle-
browed and unlettered bloke were much on a level
in military affairs. The former was, in one or two
outstanding cases, not only centuries but millenniums
ahead in painting, sculpture, architecture, literature,
politeness, cleanliness and in the knowledge how to
wear his toga at the proper angle; but he didn’t,
until comparatively late years, turn his superior
intelligence to the devising of extra-superior- weapons
of, war. Discipline might be better, and the Mace-
donian phalanx or the Roman legion might have
advantages over the mob formations of tribes which
had no alphabet, but one fellow’s bow and spear and
sword were much like the other fellow’s. The lead
. that progressive man had over his unprogressive
brother in enterprise of martial kind was absurdly
small, and as the former had something worth steal-
ing the tendency was for the latter to come against
him ip successive waves till he was ultimately
mobbed down. It was done so thoroughly that only
when his heirs paw among the debris of Crete or
Egypt do they faintly realise how much the world
lost and how far it was set back through the airship
not being invented sooner, to say nothing of poison
gas. A bomb dropped on Attila would have been
a godsend.
Then the man with the large brain began to
devote it to the making of highly scientific instru-
ments of butchery, and as the man with the small
brain wasn’t scientific and could only follow him
a little way, civilisation began to look more perma-
nent. Also war became less numerous —at least, it
didn’t break out in the same place three times
on the same day, and each peer didn’t run his own
private campaign. Possibly the Mongol, Turk, Arab
and their kind are even better fighting animals of
the old sort than they were in the old days when
the old sort of fight was worth having. But they
have fallen behind, and seem quite unlikely to catch
up, and the ancient dread of them has mostly died
out, It is assumed that it will remain dead. Now
disarmament is the fashion, and it is a good enough
fashion, and much better than some of the early-
Victorian styles in ladies’ clothes, if not carried too
far. Unfortunately some of its heated apostles enter-
tain the idea that progressive man should disencumber
himself of his hard-won supremacy in war-furniture,
so that the savage and the ignorant may have an-
other chance to own the earth, and the thick-headed
have a new run for their money. They hold that the
day of world movements and perambulating armed
nations is over. It may be so, but an Albanian or
Moorish brigand clan or a joint-stock company of
Cantonese pirates might be a quite sufficient nucleus
for. another upheaval if civilisation took on an
absurdly peaceful aspect. The once overshadowing
Turkish Empire began with an obscure tribe. That
of the Arabs had an even more obscure origin. It
commenced with a preacher and a congregation.
The outstanding authority on disarmament is
Isaiah, the Jew, a well-rpeaning man, no doubt, who
died 2600 years ago, leaving behind him (at least
it is ascribed to him) this still unfulfilled weather
forecast: “They shall beat their swords into plough-
shares and their spears into pruning-hooks. Nation
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall
they learn war any more.” No date is set for the
event, and various peoples who rashly forestalled
the proper time have fallen in. I doubt, for my
own part, if the happening will make so much differ-
ence as is commonly supposed. The assurance that
one nation shall no longer lift the sword against
another has been literally fulfilled already, the sword
being out of date; but even taken in its figurative
sense it doesn’t move me to be a fanatical disarmer.
If people don’t lift the sword I presume they will
lift the hook instead, and it would be a nasty
weapon. There is less than appears in the statement
that communities will learn war no more. If they
go to war with hooks they can make the world a
shambles without any formal learning, though a
cult of scientific hooking would doubtless grow up
as hostilities progressed. At its worst each force
wouldn’t be much less organised than an early
Israelitish army, and that was slaughterous enough
by local accounts. Legend even tells of one gory
battle fought to a finish with an ox-goad, and an-
other with the jawbone of a disrespected and un-
musical animal. Hebrew writers, by the way, only
began to preach disarmament after their nation had
lost its punch and had mislaid the glorious old
habit of winning battles. Isaiah himself did his per-
suasive foretelling when the enemy was storming
at Jerusalem’s gates. In that respect the race was
much like others. My own attitude is that, if I had
a spear and all the neighborhood had the same, a
general exchange for pruning-hooks would suit me
down to the ground. But if I possessed the only
automatic rifle in the district, and my surroundings
were infested by dubious characters with spears, 1
would be deaf to all blandishments, and stick to
the gun like glue. Anybody, even a saint or an
archbishop, who wanted to beat it into anything
but what it was would have to use force. Legal
proceedings wouldn’t avail.

Sport or Manslaughter?
The death of another slugged-out Stadium
boxer (the third since October 27) evoked
some priceless contributions to the litera-
ture of snuffle. This was the Tabor Daily's
effort: —•
The passing of George Mendies has cast a gloom
over boxing circles all over Australia. Followers
of the sport in Sydney are looking forward to next
Saturday night’s contest between Godfrey and Grime
as a means of lightening their gloom. For the
battle between these two champions will surely draw
the minds of everyone present away from regretful
retrospection.
It would make a noble subject for a poet
or painter—a typical Stadium crowd being
beguiled from its anguish at the tragic issue
of one bruising match by gazing at another.
The Sun announced that Mrs. Mendies was
in necessitous circumstances, and protruded
the inevitable hat. In other words, .it
invited the public to assume a responsibility
that should be borne wholly by Stadiums,
Ltd., whose Mr. John Wren is re-
putedly one of the wealthiest men in Aus-
tralia. The obligation of Stadiums, Ltd.,
is added to, if that were possible, by the
fact that Mendies was engaged at short
notice owing to another pugilist being unable
to fulfil his contract. According to the
Referee, the dead boy agreed to face the
music against his better judgment. His
prospective opponent was in superior condi-
tion, as well as being the stronger and
heavier man. The difference in weights was
officially announced to be silb. Even that is
a big discrepancy where flyweights are con-
cerned ; but to the Labor Daily and Guar-
dian reporters it looked more like a stone.
The Guardian’s account has a bearing on
the question of the promoter’s responsibility,
to the widow if not to the public:—
Mendies fought with all his wonderful brilliance,
and piled up the points at a great rate until the
10th. The sorely-battered Gordon then took charge.
Mendies had fought himself practically to a stand-
still tired himself out. The Victorian gave the
little man a torrid time for five rounds. He had
Mendies very rocky in the 12th. . . .George was
very tired when the 15th round arrived Coming
out of a mf*l6e in the 15th Gordon put- across a
magnificent right to the chin, and Mendies dropped
like a log, his head hitting the mat with a sicken-
ing crack. He was later taken to St. Vincent s
Hospital.
It is instructive to compare the foregoing
with other newspaper reports of what hap-
pened to the previous victims of Stadium
sport:—•
In the 17th round Dunstan was so palpably
beaten (he had been floored three times) that when
Gornik pushed him off he fell to the canvas again.
With his arms round his opponent’s legs, and his
head between them, Dunstan, smiling bravely, re-
marked to the nearest onlookers, “I’m done!” He
came out for the 18th round, weak but determined
as ever, to receive a scientific clip on the point, and
to fall full length on the floor, with which his head
came in contact with resounding force. He lifted
his head, as if in an attempt to rise, then sank
back limp and unconscious. .
Soady, who was only 18 years old, was having
his first contest over the 20-round journey, all his
previous appearances having been in 10-round
bouts. When the gong rang for the 17th round he
could not leave his corner. He leaned against the
ropes in a. dazed condition, unable to protect him-
self. Lynagii advanced across the ring in fighting
attitude and dealt out a few blows. Soady fell
through the ropes, where he was counted out. The
unconscious boxer was lifted into his chair.
There was a time when the death of a prize-
fighter in action would have been followed
as a matter of course by half a dozen arrests.
Promoter, referee, seconds and the surviving
principal would at least have been required
to show that the tragedy was not due to their
negligence. No inconsiderate action of the
sort has been taken since WREN went into
the business. Nowadays the majesty of the
Law is thought to be vindicated by a lacka-
daisical inquest closing with the idiotic ver-
dict “No blame attachable to anyone. Poli-
ticians are apparently as blind as coroners to
the dangerous features of the 20-round con-
test, which has been abolished in the U.b.A.,
France, Belgium and other countries, and is
obsolescent even in Britain. And when
some unfortunate gladiator is battered to
death, while practically helpless to defend
himself, his employers, however rich, are
not legally obliged (as other employers are
in less iniquitous cases) to care for his de-
pendants, while their moral responsibilities
may be avoided or passed on to the_ public.
So great is the “pull,” political and other-
wise, of the gentry who are in sport tor
what they can make out of it.

A Text from Egypt.
Recent cable-news concerning the sudden
interest of Zaghlul Pasiia in the Souaan
might be studied with profit by Australians
who imagine that nations are satisfied with
less than they think they can take. Egypt
only became independent a little over a year
ago, and its Parliament is barely four months
old. Yet already there is talk of absorbing
the Soudan, though, in the words of London
Times, “there is nothing to show that the
Soudanese desire to revert, to Egyptian rule,
under which they were driven as slaves and
decimated.” It is a century since Mehemet
Ali made his unprovoked and unheralded
descent on the Soudan, the object being loot.
The organised army of Egypt was able to
subdue the scattered bands of Soudanese and
the latter suffered hideously. In the ensuing
40 years the Egyptian masters of the Soudan,
according to Baker Pasha, “utterly ruined
it.” Meanwhile Mahdism was growing in
strength, and in 1881 the storm broke. The
Egyptians were flung out with
and it took a British army under Kitchener
to subdue the Khalifa (the Mahdi s suc-
cessor) 17 years later. Since then, althcrngh
Egypt has nominally co-operated with Bri-
tain in the administration of the Soudan,
the name of the Gyppo has been mud m the
estimation of the stout and bellicose mack
men of the South, who have managed to
establish a complete ascendancy over the
physicallv and morally debilitated Gyppos.
Yet, despite all the factors —their well-
founded terror of the Soudanese, the know-
ledge that a move on the Soudan will be
reprobated by the whole civilised world, and
the fact that they have no urgent reason,
apart from national pride, for going there

the Gyppos are evidently disposed to repeat
the adventure that brought them gold and
glory a hundred years ago. Australia has for
neighbors a race of Asiatics as proud and
formidable as the Gyppos are humble and
futile—a people who, whether individually
or nationally, fear neither Australians nor
anybody else; who possess the strongest
fleet in this hemisphere, and who are in
desperate need of territory for their ever-
increasing surplus population. Are they
likely to shirk a risk that the newly-born
Egyptian State appears to be seriously con-
sidering? If not, the whole case for dis-
armament goes by the board.

The first hours of the resumed Federal ses-
sion were occupied with an appeal from the
customary Country members for low-duty or
duty-free wire-netting. The case, as stated,
was that sheep and wheat support the towns
and cities, but that they can’t support them-
selves against the rabbit and the dingo, with
which they continuously wage an uphill and
losing scrap. And it was inferred, though
not said, that the time was at hand when
Australia will be abandoned to these two
beasts and the cactus, and that when the
wild dog has finished the local fauna, includ-
ing the rabbit, and is reduced to living on
the meagre diet of his own tail, the cactus
will smother the remnant of him and take
possession. These complaints and warnings
arise _ from the proposal to put an anti-
dumping duty on imported netting for the
defence of the local factories. It was set
forth that such a step would be fatal. It
was likewise set forth that “the Darling area
is now under control of rabbits and dingoes,
and sheep have been driven out,” which
seems to be an assertion that though there
was no anti-dumping duty in the past things
are at least moderately fatal already. Two
niatters are certain in this connection. One
is that population is a great discouragement
to rabbits, wild horses, wild dogs, wild lions,
bears, hares and even giraffes, especially if
ir is a sporting population of the Australian
type. The other is that unless this country
acquires a much bigger industrial population
and diffuses it through a multitude of little
towns, there isn’t likely to be enough people
anywhere beyond the capital cities and their
environs to permanently discourage any-
thing.

Colonial Secretary Thomas has failed to
secure a satisfactory compromise on the
Irish Boundary question, and if he
had been Colonial Secretary Talleyrand
he would probably have done no better. A
Solomon might have settled the matter —
provided he had hypothecated enough of his
glories to hire a large and determined army.
At present the position is that the Belfast
State refuses to appoint its member of the
boundary-fixing Commission on the ground
that the present frontier between it and the
Free State was fixed and accepted by it in
1920; that it didn’t consent to, and wasn’t
consulted or even informed about, the
promise to re-open the frontier question with
which the shifty Lloyd George bought a sort
of peace from the Republican party of 1921;
and that it isn’t bound by it. Incidentally
it has a plea akin to that of the defendant
who says that he didn’t order or receive the
goods, and if he did he sent them back, and
in any case he paid for them, and besides
they were damaged and valueless. It pleads
that it isn’t bound to appoint its member of
the Frontier Commission for 1000 years or
more, no date for the fatal ceremony hav-
ing been fixed. Downing-street has taken a
ton of legal advice to find out if it can legally
compel Belfast to appoint a representa-
tive, or if it can appoint itself, or if it can
go on with the business with only two com-
missioners—the Dublin one and a Londoner.
Apparently it can’t do anything unless it
passes a Repudiation Act, and enforces the
same in the usual manner. Michael Col-
lins swore by all his gods that Lloyd
George purchased the Irish peace by promis-
ing that the boundary-fixers would be so
fixed that they would give the Free State
the two disputed counties and the towns of
Newry and Derry, all at the expense of the
Belfast colony. But Collins is dead, and so
are Arthur Griffith and Cathal Brugha
and other material witnesses. Lloyd
George says the dead are liars, and the Bel-
fast people say that the Welshman is an
unspeakable hound if they are not. And in
the midst of all this confusion and vilification
there are still persons who believe that the
Irish problem is settled.

Melbourne’s tramway strike took nobody
by surprise. It was to have occurred
during Fleet Week, but a serious cable break-
age gave so many employees a rest from
toil that the service couldn’t logically com-
plain of being worked to death. Mischief
was bound to follow the employment of hun-
dreds of ex-policemen on the tramways. As
declared rebels against the Government,
heartlessly _ indifferent to public interests
when the city was being intimidated by ugiy
lawbreakers, these dismissed public servants,
with their precious “union” office in touch
with that of Tom Walsh, at Melbourne
Trades Hall, were accepted by the very
Government they had defied as public ser-
vants in the Tramways Department. It
was asking for trouble. Had the Tramways
service remained an abused private enter-
prise, powerless to raise fares 25 per cent,
on Sundays and public holidays, such as the
Government did, then would those dismissed
policemen have been regarded with shrewd
commercial suspicion, and left to find work
more suited to their size and latent muscular
development, than punching tram-tickets. But
the Government foolishly hoped to propi-
tiate rebellion by putting dismissed strikers
into new billets. The policy was on a par
with the stupidity of Lawson in throwing
up his billet to take the Speakership before
he had assured himself he would be elected
to the vacant wig and gown. Those of the
tramway-travelling public who didn’t actu-

“A Melbourne tramway employee was recently suspended for refusing to instruct as a gripman a
man who was a special constable during the police strike. As the Commissioners refused to lift the sus-
pension, 3000 tramway employees went on strike.”
HOUSEHOLDER: “Here, dash it all, what are you doing to my house?”
THE CLASS-CONSCIOUS: “We're declaring it Hack, mister, because a bloke who tried to
be a ‘ special' leaned up against it. We 'ad to wooden out your dorg, too, owing
to ’im having contaminated it by stroking its ’ead!”
influence of the firebrands who caused the
police strike could be felt: it was in the air
like an unpleasant odor.

Natara” : Cotton-growing in the “dry belt”
region of Papua may yet be made a payable
proposition. The soil has been shown to
be suitable for the culture of good staple
cotton of the upland variety. The chief
hurdle that confronts growers is the uncer-
tainty of the labor supply. A feast or a
funeral is always the signal for a general
stoppage to enable Brown Brother to show
his joy or sorrow by the consumption of
pork and betel-nut. Indentured labor, unless
it can be profitably utilised during the grow-
ing period of the crop, is extremely expen-
sive, as Patakalana Cotton Estates, Ltd.,
may find. The co.’s lands are mostly river
flats, rich alluvial soil clothed with lalang
and other grasses, that can quickly be
ploughed and planted by indentured native
labor under white supervision. Motor-
transport is possible from the estate to the
shipping point on Hood Peninsula, and this
may reduce the expense of bringing the ven-
ture to the producing stage. But the labor
question is an essential one; the Papuan
quickly tires of regular toil. In a land
that produces all his wants for the mini-
mum of exertion, it is only when he craves
for tobacco, axes, beads, calico and other im-
ported luxuries that he tightens up his vee-
string pants and tackles plantation work.
With cotton lint selling at 17d. per lb. there
is little doubt that the Venture could be made
profitable, but, as The Bulletin remarks
(20/3/’24), “the vital point....is not what
the market price will be this year or next,
but what it will be years ahead.”
Papua badly wants another industry to help
her out of the financial rut that the Naviga-
tion Act has pushed her into, 'and cotton
seems the only thing in sight at present. At
various places in the “dry belt” adjacent to
Moresby there are now promising areas under
cotton, and two small ginneries are in readi-
ness to deal with the coming harvest.

“2nd Divvy” on what, after all, may be
merely a case of salutitis: —
Lieut-Colonel Elgood's distress at the lax morals
of the A.I.F. presents one of those flawless samples
of English hypocrisy which give occasion for so
much ribald mirth to the Paris press. For nearly
quarter of a century, up to the end of 1914, the
authority of Britain in Cairo had been very nearly
absolute. From the first moments of the war it-
was absolute. During many years of the peace period
Lieut.-Colonel Elgood had held offices in the Egyptian
Government. When the war came, the C.O.C. Cairo
District found him there, an acknowledged authority
on local affairs, and gave him one of the most
desirable billets that any “dug-out,” without active
service to his credit, got during the whole of the
fighting. Unlike most of his tribe, he was listened
to by those in the highest places: his experience
gave him power. As showing what could be done in
the way of regulation, neither natives of the country
nor the “other ranks” of any of the armies were
allowed into reputable hotels or clubs; the houses
of ill-fame were rigorously controlled after the first
six months (chiefly as a result of an agitation
begun by Colonel Barrett, of Melbourne) ; disaffected
Gyppo civilians were beaten into a subdued frame of
mind in the public streets; and the flogging of
members of the Egyptian Army (of which Lieut-
Colonel Elgood was Financial Secretary) at the
hands of the hated Soudanese was a spectacle that
might have been enjoyed by practically anyone in
the Spring of 1916. Yet the Wazzir remained the
same old cesspit that Napoleon had found it over a
century before. A military policeman and a score of
men armed with nothing more lethal than sticks could
have abolished every resort where bestiality and the
sin for which the Cities of the Plain were destroyed
held sway. Nothing was done by Lieut-Colonel
Elgood and his colleagues to discourage the practice
of these abominations ; nothing was even attempted.
The only two definite moves to clean up the un-
speakable place were made, oddly enough, by mem-
bers of the A.I.F. The so-called “Wazzir riots” arose
from the determination of some of the men to destroy
certain houses of ill-fame; and it was a party of
Light Horsemen that put an end to an animalistic
side-show which had flourished under the sign of the
Union Jack, and with great profit to its Asiatic
proprietor, for over nine years. If there is one
Englishman more than another who should have main-
tained a deathly silence on the moral issue, so far
as Egypt is concerned, it is surely Lieut.-Colonel
Elgood. But he is an incorrigible British type—
one of those complacent Pharisees who visit cities
like Melbourne and Sydney and with averted eyes
deplore that they can show no such proof of national
modesty and purity as is offered daily by, say,
Piccadilly and Regent-street after 5 p.m.
«
“JD.” : W. M. Hughes is telling the trust-
ing inhabitants of the U.S.A. that “the
population of Australia is more thoroughly
homogeneous than that of any other country
outside of Asia, for it is 97 per cent. Anglo-
Saxon.” It is probably not 5 per cent.
Anglo-Saxon. The Anglo-Saxon—a product
of the Teutonic settlements that began in
England in the fifth century—is one of the
rarest types even in the U.K. to-day. When
found his distinguishing marks (china-blue
eyes and a delicate fairness of skin) can
usually be traced, as in the case of the Prince
of Wales, to a not very remote German an-
cestor. W. M. Hughes is as pure a Gelt as
any French Breton. The best object-lesson
in the racial blend that goes to make up an
Australian may be seen at a G.P.S. regatta,
where C. of E. and Methodist (English),
Scots and R.C. (Irish) schoolboys meet.
Later, despite the fulminations of their
pastor, they will intermarry with the giris
who cheer their efforts from the banks and
reproduce tall, lean, dark, long-nosed and
long-headed boys of the sort Masefield
viewed on Gallipoli. To make the object-
lesson quite perfect, however, there should
at every aquatic festival, from Perth to Syd-
ney, be a Jewish boat. The Jewish strain is
strong in Australia—stronger than the Anglo-
Saxon.
♦—
It was the wily President Harming, of the
United States, who set going the train of
circumstances which ended the Australia —a
better ship even at the end than we are likely
to have for many years. He got together the
representatives of five Great Powers, of which
three (Britain, France and Italy) owed
Uncle Sam much money, and an agreement
was fixed up. By it the British Empire
and the United States are limited to the
same tonnage of battleships and battle-
cruisers (525,000 tons apiece), and of ships
for carrying aircraft (135,000 tons each).
Ships are a dire necessity to Father Bull,
who must ensure the safety of food routes
over many seas, or be starved out, and his
naval force isn’t exactly mobile in conse-
quence, while to Uncle Samuel, who is self-
supporting, they are more of a luxury, or a
means of conquest. So in the years
during which the bargain lasts Britain really
takes second (very second) place as a naval
institution. A strict limitation of size
(35,000 tons for warships and 27,000 tons
for aircraft carriers) is imposed. The size
seems ideal, ■ for if foreign competition made
it necessary to build 70,000-ton leviathans it
would also be necessary for Uncle to be in a
chronic state of enlarging the Panama Canal
at great expense. The lieavily-armed 10,000-
or 14,000-tonners, on the other hand, can not
only navigate the Canal, but do it with
such a margin that the danger of a block at a
critical hour is not great. The heavily-
fortified Canal is the secret of Uncle’s easy
greatness at sea, for it enables his navy to
be in the world’s two greatest oceans at once,
in a manner of speaking, and almost turns
one navy into two. When the greatest naval
base ever known is established amid the
Hawaiian Islands (the building of such a
concern is within the limits of the agree-
ment), the Pacific will be Uncle’s lake—
unless an Asiatic Power does something un-
expected.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The new S.A. Labor Government i : s
deeply suspected of a desire to legalise the
bookmaker. And Chief Secretary Jelly
—a second ein the name seems superfluous
hasn’t allayed the suspicion by announcing
that “there is much to be said in favor or
the proposal, on account of the crushing and
inconvenience suffered by the investing pub-
lic on our racecourses,” and that “it may be
left to a private member to introduce a bill.
Racing is comparatively infrequent in Jelly s
State, and is all the healthier on that
account. If bookmakers are licensed, pro-
prietary clubs (hitherto discouraged) will
spring up, increased dates will be demanded,
and in process of time horse-gambling will
become the raging disease in Adelaide that it
is in Melbourne and Sydney. Have Labor
Governments no higher ideals for the workers
than to make punters of them V Must it be
concluded that there is a dose alliance be-
tween Labor and the gambling interest m ail
the States?
Because a gripman objected to be associ-
ated with a tramway trainee whose crime
was that he had applied for a job as a special
constable, the whole street-car service north
of the Yarra was thrown out of action by a
strike. Incidentally, Labor Day was. spoiled
for people who wanted to get to the city and
couldn’t walk or hire taxis. When the
strikers had cooled their heels for four days
Premier Alec Peacock was induced to inter-
vene. He built a bridge of the only kind
an impatient public was likely to tolerate,
but the militants of the union kicked it into
the stream. So the head of the Govern-
ment told the men to do some pondering and
he would see them in three days. The diffi-
culty was that the men’s representatives
who accepted a basis of settlement were —or
affected to be —only agents, whereas the Tram
Board had plenary powers. Many of the
tramwaymen were against the stupid busi-
ness from the start; indeed, there would have
been no strike could a secret ballot, con-
ducted by a returning-officer with a soul
above bogus voting-papers and ballot-boxes
with sliding panels, have been taken first.
Figurehead Lang, of the N.S.W. Labor
party, did “the duty of his hire” when ho
published his minor scoff at the people
who object to the bogus “recall” which the
political Labor bosses have adopted. The
genuine recall means that the persons who put
in Stodge, M.P., can set machinery to work
and put him out again before his time if the
case calls for it. The Labor idea is that
Stodge’s resignation is to be held by an
“executive,” not one member of which may
be a constituent of his, and the people who
compose it may send it to the Speaker if
Stodge displeases them. The constituents
won’t come into the matter, so it won’t be
a recall. The craving for any vulgar little
scrap of authority in “official circles” is
pathetic.
Labor candidates for the Westralian Leg.
Council got some help, odd as it seems, from
the post-war rise in rents, which enabled
hundreds of small householders to comply
with the stupid £l7 qualification. Thus
assisted, the Collier Government gained three
seats at the biennial elections, and though
still in a minority in the House with the
£l7 franchise, it will be able to make a re-
spectable showing. One of the three seats
was recovered by .7. M. Drew, editor of the
Geraldton Express, who is to lead the Cham-
ber for Collier, as he did for Scaddan and
Daglish. Drew is the only man who .has held
office in all three Labor Governments, yet he
wasn’t a pledged Laborite when appointed
in the first nor a member of Parliament when
included in the third —in fact, he was named
leader of a House in which lie hadn’t sat for
six years. r
Heard in the lobbies : i 7 ~
The full story of Lawson’s defeat for the Vic.
Speakership may never be published, but enough of
it is known to show that the ex-Premier was deserted
by men whom he regarded as his friends. Rumor
is even whispering the names of two or three
Laborites who urged the ex-Premier to nominate and
promised him their votes. It is alleged, moreover,
that the Cookies were almost equally divided re-
garding Bowser’s candidature, and that if Allison,
member for Borung, had been present, there would
have been a majority in favor of Lawson. However,
the man from Castlemaine won’t remain submerged
for long. Failing an absolute majority at the
approaching election, the Liberals will probably unite
again with the Agriculturists and then Lawson will
get another chance.
Prof. Mills, the Political Economy man of
Sydney Uni., talked to the National Council
A LOT OF NURSE TO A VERY LITTLE BABY.
“Three Commissioners are to be appointed to manage Canberra, one at £3000 p.a. and two at £2000 p.a.”
of Women about the iniquity of the. press in
“spreading a distrust of colored races and a
threatened invasion from these sources.”
Yankee political authorities report that
Japan is running the biggest warship-build-
ing programme in the world, having 178,000
tons under construction, against 04,500 in
the U.S. —it is building faster than the U.S.,
France and Italy put together.. The publi-
cation of an item like that being liable to
“spread a distrust of a colored race,” pre-
sumably the Prof, would censor it out of
the papers. Once upon a time similar acti-
vity on the part of Germany was censored
out of most of the papers—to the great con-
cern of men like Lord Roberts —and a mil-
lion women are paying for it to-day.
Sydney Telegraph, interviewing a manu-
facturer of linseed oil: —
The prevailing price for linseed is 9s. per bushel,
and my company alone uses 800,000 bushels per
annum, practically all imported. The Argentine
produces about 60,000,000 bushels per annum, and
the crop averages a larger yield per acre than wheat.
There is not the slightest doubt that when Australia
gets over its craze for wheat-growing it will grow
linseed.
Unfortunately the Country party is very
little interested in growing things to be
manufactured here with a view to meeting
a local demand. Manufactured goods, it
holds, should be imported from places a long
way off, and local raw materials exported
to the remotest spot that anybody can dis-
cover. The fascination of wheat apparently
lies in the fact that we don’t want any more
of it, and find it difficult to get a decent
price for what we have.
The House of Reps, has been holding de-
bate about the appointment of three expen-
give Governors for the metropolis of hole-and-
Cornerberra ; and member Watkins (N.S.W.)
turned the dim horn-lantern of mental illu-
mination on the subject thus: —
The construction of Canberra was the only argu-
ment that induced N.S.W. to agree to Federation.
•Joel Moses Gabb (S.A.) was so impressed
with this view of the Ma State as a selfish
blackmailer that he was induced to remark
that it was “a dreadful admission.” Of
course, there wasn’t a vestige of truth in the
silly statement, but a man shouldn’t throw
mud at his mother, even in jest. It isn't
done in the best families.
Assuming that it is necessary for the
Fuller Government to check Dorman, Long
and Co.’s calculations in connection with the
North Shore Bridge tender, there is no justi-
fication in the wide world for sending three
or four public servants abroad to do the job.
Already in England there is a consulting
engineer to the N.S.W. Government (an ex-
Director-General of Public Works) with a
secretarial staff in the Agent-General’s office-
competent to handle the checking and inci-
dental correspondence ; and the Agent-General
himself is an engineer whose specialty is
figures.
Events move fast in the British House of
Commons now, even if they don’t move in
a straight line. The train may go off the
track, or it may be seen suddenly coming
back on the same track with the guard’s-van
first, but no doubt exists about the move-
ment. This is partly because even big affairs
are left to be private members’ business,
which saves Cabinet consultation, responsi-
bility, the labors of bill-drafting and the
anxiety about a majority. On a recent day
Scotland came near to getting a Home Rule
Parliament of its own (so far as the Com-
mons could grant it) almost at an hour’s
notice; only the measure ran aground on a
formality, and will have to be launched
afresh.
There are some nasty knocks for Theodore s
State in a pamphlet prepared by the Tas-
manian Statistician, L. F. Giblin, at the
direction of Labor Premier Lyons. Giblin
finds Queensland easily the most heavily-
taxed State, both absolutely and in compari-
son with the wealth of the people. His
figures show, further, that the taxpaying
capacity of the Queensland people has fallen
steadily for years past. In 1915-16 it was
higher than that of any State except W.A
Queensland’s index figure being 1149 and
W.A.’s 1215. By 1920-21 it had fallen to
789; Giblin does not follow it any lower. In
the same period S.A. rose from 778 to 1075
and Victoria from 945 to 1158.
Not content with affronting the Liberals
by putting Bowser in the Speaker’s chair,
the Labor-Cocky combination in Vic.
Assembly tossed out McDonald, a Liberal
nominee for the Railway Committee, and
installed Weaver, of the Country party.
Thinking that the Agrarians might feel in-
clined to reciprocate, Prendergast tried a
no-confidence motion, but as that meant dis-
solution the Farmers were not on. What
was the good of getting a Speakership and
a seat on the Committee to throw both away
at once ? Of the 17 Cockies in the two Vic.
Chambers nine have had perks of some kind.
The seven who are not now billet-holders are
ex-Ministers.
In the course of the S’African election
campaign the word “secession” appears to
have become almost as common as "blanky
is in Australia. Frederick Moor, long 1 re-
mier of ultra-“loyal” Natal, lias created ex-
citement by joining the Nationalists. Charles
Malan has explained that secession will be
declared when the people are ready. Hertzog
has denied that the alliance between Labor
and Secession implies any abatement or
energy on the p&rt of the latter. And while
these things happen in S’Africa the Ram-
shackle Ministry in Britain assists the dis-
rupters by an angry refusal of any form of
Dominion preference, and by a general tone
of disregard, or even contempt, for the
Dominions.
Something like an earthquake:—
The N. S. Wales branch of the Australian Railway-
men’s Union is full of trouble. First, Buckley, its
secretary, was expelled by the A.L.P. executive for
his association (innocent he swears), with the ballot-
boxes with sliding panels; and the A.L.P. conference
confirmed the expulsion, notwithstanding that Buckley
induced a union convention to affiliate with the
Labor party. Buckley and the affiliation are botli
sore points with members who don’t want to be
mixed up with Sydney Labor politics. Then the
union bosses hit upon the dazzling idea of applying
to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for the
Piddington basic wage of £5 lGs. a week, which
looked beautiful until the union council mentioned
something about a levy of 265. a head to finance the
case. Then there was a tempest. A council election
occurring at this stage, 239 ballot-papers were
rejected as bogus, and a committee of inquiry has
despairingly suggested that the returning-officer might
have been mistaken. Another election has been
decided upon, and meantime there is grim talk of
secessions unless Buckley is dismissed.
“Old Campaigner’s” version :
The Sydney A.L.P. conference did not specifically
refuse to readmit Arthur Griffith (B. 8/5/’24).
From my knowledge of the feelings of delegates, 1
am convinced that a big majority would have wel-
comed him back. But N. S. Wales Labor still bars
conscriptionists (although Westralian Labor has
never rejected them as such), and this point having
been taken, the chairman had no option but to refuse
to put the motion for Griffith’s readmission. The
next conference will, I feel sure, amend the anti-
eonscriptionist rule and conduct Griffith through tiie
unlocked door.
According to evidence given by W. D.
Bracher, a special officer of Vic. Railway
department, before the Parliamentary Rail-
way Committee in Melbourne, the electric
suburban trains have proved so attractive
that they carried 21,000,000 extra passengers
in 1922-23. In making his estimate Bracher
allowed for what would have been the normal
increase under the steam system. Undoubt-
edly the trains are quick, comfortable and
clean, and the chief eulogists are visitors
from sister capitals. Some of the business
picked up by Clapp during the tram strike
is going to be held by him, and that is one
of the Tram Board’s minor annoyances.
The Australian fruit industry has some
very foolish representatives. It having been
coinplained by mainland apple-growers that
Tasmania was exporting fruit infested with
black spot, one Piggott, a Speck politician,
justified the suicidal business, asserting that
“the people of England are crying out for
our apples.” Proceeding, he boasted that,
“although we have exported a great quantity
of spotty fruit, we have never had a bad
report from Britain.” Well, they have one
now. Getting word from Australia that ship-
loads of spotty apples were going from Pig-
gott’s State, by favor of the stupid Common-
wealth authorities, the Americans rushed
poor stuff of their own into the British
market, with the result, as reported from
London last week, that “fruit blemished with
black spot has been saleable only at poor
prices,” and Australia has got an advt.
which it could have well done without.
From Sydney Telegraph, which is a great
deal more friendly to Australian industry
than it used to be: —
What’s the matter with Australia’s knitting indus-
try? No fewer than 32 of the smaller manufacturers
of knitted goods in the Commonwealth have recently
been obliged to close their doors. Notwithstanding
a high Protective tariff Australia imported, for the
eight months ended February last, £1,631,999 worth of
hosiery, and £2,247,430 worth of woollen piece goods.
But the tariff isn’t high. Considering how
Britain, despite its cheap labor, is flooded
with the wares of lands with depreciated
currencies, and passes loads of. them on to
us under the preference-to-Britain clause,
we have almost ceased to have any tariff at
all. The depreciated franc struck the Aus-
tralian woollen industry a terrific blow, and
the Tariff Board, which moves like a petri-
fied elephant its wonders to perform, takes
months to think over a matter like that.
And Parliament takes more months.
The dwindling of Victoria’s rural popula-
tion is revealed every time the Statistician
makes a count. In 1923 the Backblocks
lost 1000 people, though the increase for the
State was 35,155. Soldier-settlement has
made no perceptible difference, and agricul-
tural immigrants, of whom so much is writ-
ten, are seemingly taking up allotments in
the Fitzroy Gardens and on the greensward
around St. Paul’s Cathedral. Melbourne
is now 147,000 short of a million souls. Bal-
larat. Bendigo and Geelong, the only size-
able other towns in the State, remain station-
ary in the thirty thousands.
ANOTHER DEADLY SIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There is a cabled rumor that'Labor Prime Minister
Macdonald is likely to become engaged to Lady
Margaret Sackville, a daughter of Earl de la Warr.
It may be the usual cable canard, but it it isn t
well there’s not much hope for a party whose leader
marries the daughter of an earl.” — Worker.
Ye young and ardent Laborites
Who count on work well done
To lift you to the dizzy heights
Where Theodore exultant lights,
And Collier sits, and Gunn,
One pitfall to avoid you’ve got,
Beware it! Sure as Hades
From out the camp you’ll soon be shot
Should you aspire to link your lot
With some patrician lady’s.
The whitest vest-slips you may wear,
The most voluptuous hat,
And none will scornfully declare
It spoils your claim to be a square
And sturdy democrat.
Punt on the turf, like any lord,
And picnic on the water
An ’t please you. But you can’t afford
To let your fancies stray toward
A titled person’s daughter.
To stars (in reason) you may hitch
Your waggon if you choose.
Even the act of growing rich
Won’t ipso facto queer your pitch
Or suspect make your views
When Tyrant Fat you still berate
With fluency and passion.
But never seek for skirted mate
A damosel of high estate, ■
A sprig of rank and fashion.
Already there are crimes galore,
Of that you needn’t doubt,
To open wide the caucus door
The while transgressors, shamed and sore,
Are gently booted out;
Fell sins that into darkness hurl
Full many an erring brother—
Should Ramsay Mac. acquire a girl
For wife whose dad’s a belted earl,
Well, that will make another.

Bank of Adelaide profits responded well to
the quarter-million of new capital and
£50,000 of share-premiums which share-
holders contributed midway in the previous
financial year. Paid capital is now £875,000,
compared with a half-million only four years
ago, and disclosed profits for the past 12
months were so good that after giving the
customary 10 p.c. to shareholders the lay-by
was not much less than the average of pre-
vious years. After having developed internal
reserves to protect weaker securities, total
visible accumulated profits now amount to
£778,024. The bank’s own funds exceed
£1,653,000, compared with £1,035,000 10
years ago and with £1,084,000 only five years
back. Over the same period other principal
balance-sheet groups have moved in this way:

The deposit figures do not give evidence of
much progress recently; on the other hand
the fluctuations are of no consequence, the
figures having been affected by seasonal con-
ditions. The position of the Bank of Adel-
aide in its home State is revealed by a few
comparisons of average deposits (at Decem-
ber 31 for each year) :

Though the Commonwealth Bank is a new,
formidable competitor and the powerful all-
Australian banks have given more attention
to S. Aus., its own home-grown concern still
clings to 23 p.c. of the State’s total deposits
compared with 28 p.c. 10 years ago. Late
in life it decided to develop inter-State inter-
ests ; a branch was opened in Sydney in 1918
and another in Perth in 1922, and it has
operated in Melbourne for many years.
The new capital enabled the management
to increase accommodation to clients; at
March 31 advances were within a few thou-
sands of the record figures of 1921, when the
banks were forced to carry customers over
the period of abnormally high stocks which
followed the heavy post-war importations.
Even with the advances so expanded, at
March 31 the Bank of Adelaide held no less
than 55 p.c. of its total liabilities to the pub-
lic in liquid form, which was an exceptionally
strong proportion and a couple of points better
than 12 months before. No doubt, as this
bank’s risks are not so widely spread as those
of others whose business extends throughout
the Commonwealth, it would not be wise to
bring the proportion of liquid assets down to
the 40 p.c. of liabilities which is generally
regarded as a safe working basis for Austra-
lian banks, but obviously, if necessity should
arise, the Bank of Adelaide can safely dip
deeper into its cash resources. Prom another
view-point this bank is a strong one; total
liabilities to the public amount to £6,563,792
against £1,653,024 of its own funds, so it is
handling less than £4 of the public’s money
for every £1 of funds, which is only half the
recognised safety limit. Put another way, at
March 31 there were £3,248,423 of liabilities
not covered by cash, public securities, etc.,
and the backing for that lot was £4,686,169
book value of advances and premises written
down to £259,028. All inner reserves and
more than one-tliird of the book-value of
assets could disapear before the safety of a
penny of client’s money would become doubt-
ful.

•Includes divs. to shareholders: 1922, £888;
1923, £l4BO.
The Metropolitan had a narrow escape from
being extinguished by some of its own share-
holders towards the end of last year. A few
who commanded a majority holding had been
negotiating for the sale of scrip to one of
the younger cos., and a deal was prevented
only by the other shareholders and their
friends buying them out at a stiff premium—
50s. for the £1 shares is believed to have been
paid. Everything worked out well, however,
because scrip formerly held by family inter-
ests has become widespread, and among the
new proprietors are men of good standing
in assurance and law. Capital adjust-
ments brought in £1260 of calls, making the
total paid up at December 31 £13.104. On that
small capital the directors paid during the
year divs. totalling no less than £5189, from
which it would appear that the div. rate
was 39 p.c. The distributions were, how-
ever, made on the strength of actuary W. R.
Day’s report presented in March last year,
and were the shareholders’ total cut (with
the exception of £BBB paid by the Industrial
branch in 1922) for five years. Spread over
the quinquennium the return was moderate,
more so considering the price at which some
of the shares were bought last year—though,
of course, that is the individual shareholder’s
pigeon, and must in future not be permitted
to influence the amount which proprietors
appropriate for divs. This £5189, the £BBB
from the Industrial branch in 1922 and
£458 distributed at the close of the previous
quinquennium (£6535 altogether) have been
all shareholders have received for 23 years:
a few divs. were paid prior to that year,
but the “Wild Cat” won’t recall the cir-
cumstances.
Generally transactions during the 12
months to December 31 produced results
slightly better than those for the previous
couple of years, which, following the
sale of old premises at a handsome
profit, had indicated a definite turning-
point in the Metropolitan’s career. It
had taken a very long time to reach
that stage; the co. is now in its 29th year,
and the management would not thank the
post-mortemist who dug up some early hap-
penings. Last year saw a big improvement
in the volume of new business written:
£242,400 under Ordinary policies compared
with the generally steady annual haul of
about £190,000. No doubt the handsome new
premises which the co. now occupies have,
by giving it an air of opulence, helped busi-
ness-getting. The feature of the Ordinary
branch was that, notwithstanding the larger
number of new policies, the expense rate
showed further improvements : 1911, 41.4 p.c. •
1916, 24.4 p.c.; 1921, 22.9 p.c.; 1922, 24.4
p.c.; 1923, 21.5 p.c. Those calculations do
not include div. payments, which, of course,
are as much a charge on the business as
other outgo. The new policies appear to
have been won fairly cheaply; allowing 7
p.c. of renewal premiums as a fair charge
for old business, and debiting the balance of
exes, against first premiums gives a new-
business cost of just under 100 p.c. Another
accepted method of reckoning—that new
business is 10 times costlier than old—gives
a renewals cost rate of 9.2 p.c. for the 12
months and a new business rate of 92 p.c.
Meanwhile, Industrial costs were up a trifle,
though still lower than a few years back:
1911, 66.9 p.c.; 1916, 53.7 p.c.; 1921. 48 8
p.c.; 1922, 46.2 p.c.; 1923, 48 p.c. There
is still room for a big improvement in that
branch, and if the business continues to
expand as it has done in recent years the
task should be made easier for the manage-
ment. A feature of the Industrial branch
is that the management has developed better-
class business: most of the policies are for
whole-life.
Ordinary income has more that doubled
in five years, and Industrial income not quite
doubled in six. Total policy funds, which
actuary Day reported as more than adequate
(after paying divs.) to cover the existing
liabilities under policies, now amount to
£412,588, compared with only £82,501 10
years back. That is solid progress; yet,
after 28 years, the office is still small. How-
ever, the foundations have been laid for a
big, sound business. The future depends
entirely on sound management which will
steadily enlarge business that has pros-
pects of becoming self-supporting within a
reasonable period. An outstanding feature,
compared with newer offices, is the Metro-
politan's very small capital ; in fact, it is so
small..that the directors should consider the
question of increasing it to provide larger
guarantees for policy-holders. The manage-
ment should not have much difficulty in find-
ing reasonable rates of divs. if the recent im-
proved performances are maintained. Fol-
lowing the actuarial investigation of
12 months ago—in which, by the
way,' it was assumed that future interest
earnings would average 3-J p.c., compared
with 4 p.c. expected by the younger crowd
—the latest additions of £50,000-odd to funds
suggest that the Metropolitan position is
sound. Assets at December 31 had a total
book value of £448,971, against which were
£19,893 of liabilities. The new premises
standing in the books at £134,125 are unen-
cumbered, the sale of Government securities
and the year’s harvest having provided all
necessary funds. Gilt-edged securities, de-
posits and cash totted up £185,167 (41 p.c.
of aggregate assets) ; there were £84,752 of
mortgages and shares (the latter unspeci-
fied) ; £12,923 of loans on policies; book
debts, agents’ balances, etc., accounted for
£2807; £l4OB was in office furniture; and
£2712 of premiums on policies were owing
and £BlOB were deferred. Shares in an
accident subsidiary which paid its first div.
last year have a book value of £16,969.

In January the s.s. Bodalla became a total
wreck on the Narooma bar; towards the end
of March the s.s Bcnandra followed suit on
the Moruya bar. Earlier in the financial
year it had been decided not to recondition
the s.s. Duroby, which had been severely
damaged by fire, and the co. made a “satis-
factory compromise” with underwriters. The
steamers wrecked were both insured outside,
so the Pig-and-Whistle fleet has drawn heavily
on insurance offices lately. But notwith-
standing that the wrecks must have dis-
organised trading and put the co. to some
expense, and though the South Coast for
portion of the period experienced a severe
drought—output declined badly, and the
directors “found it necessary to assist dairy-
farmers by reducing fodder freights”—the
Illawarra S.N. comes to light with net profits
of the same size as for the previous year,
and the directors have not hesitated to pay
the usual 10 p.c. divs. How distributable
profits are arrived at is not told; the revenue
and expenditure figures are office secrets,
and the directors are silent on the subjects of
net. trading profits and the allowances made
for depreciation, etc. One line in the
balance-sheet—on this occasion “Profit for
the year, £10,047” —is all they say in
figures. This concealment of trading results
is not satisfactory to shareholders, and, fol-
lowing the one-third bonus-share issue of
1920, invites criticism from consignors which
may not be justified. The far South Coast
down to Eden depends on this co. for trans-
port to markets, and everywhere there is
a general belief that freights are too high
and that a co-operative steamer alone will
lessen them. If charges are not excessive,
then this co.’s management is unnecessarily
developing a bad feeling among its clients by
its silence, and shareholders must consider
whether the policy does not invite competi-
tion.
The div. rate on cash-paid capital was not
lifted above 7 p.c. until 1914, and did not
climb to 10 p.c. until six years back. How-
ever, the co. had apparently done better than
its published accounts had admitted; while
visible reserves shrank from £9500 to only
£9O in the six years to 1913 and had
recovered to only £4114 by 1920, when the
reconstruction was undertaken £21.100 of
inner reserves were brought to light. Changes
in the balance-sheet figures over 10 years
have been as follows:
1914. 1920. 1923. 1924.
Liabilities .. £7,098 £11,505 £11.941 £7,706
Ship property .. 75,044 49,500 74,065 58,685

Book debts .. 6,158 14,078 17,121 24,180
War Loan and cash 5,958 43,062 25,881 30,170
During the year the s.s. Narani was pur-
chased to replace the wrecked Bodalla, and
the directors are considering the addition of
another steamer. Meanwhile the year’s
trading and underwriting settlements over
and above the purchase of the Narani
added £25,789 to liquid surpluses, and when
the final div. had been paid the book value
of customers’ accounts, Government securi-
ties, cash, etc., was £45,376 larger than all
liabilities. The co. is, therefore, very com-
fortable. How the written-down value of
the fleet compares with its actual present
value is not ascertainable; but that is not
of much consequence: what matters most is
its earning capacity.

This old Melbourne agency and agricultural
and pastoral finance co.—-it began 35 years
ago—has been developing so quickly that,
though paid capital was not quite £70,000
four years ago, and was then increased to
£lOO,OOO, the directors recently successfully
placed £50,000 more scrip at a 25 p.c. pre-
mium, making in all £162,500 put in by
shareholders. Besides having spent at least
£30,000 on additions to stores, the co. has
gone deeper into the pastoral-finance busi-
ness. Here is a 10-years’ survey of balance-
sheet figures:—•
1914. 1922. 1923. 1924.
Paid capital .. £69,825 £lOO,OOO £lOO,OOO £lOO,OOO
Liabilities . . 102,364 149,271 163,815 215,996
Premises & plant 61,891 77,339 91,750 107,866

Investments, etc. 6,900 30,526 31,705 12,035
Merchandise .. 1,504 3,380 7,944 2,621
Since 1914 the tally of all assets has moved
from £197,404 to £441,416. Liabilities at
March 31 looked large in relation to paid
capital, but £110,421 also lay in reserves
when the year’s divs. had been paid, and in
this business the nature and extent of the
securities held must be taken into considera-
tion when measuring debt. Against all
trading accounts and bank overdrafts total-
ling nearly £216,000 were bills, advances,
stocks, Government securities and other
liquid assets with a book value of £333,550.
With paid capital increased to £150,000
Young-husband’s is still strongly placed for
shareholders, because to earn divs. the man-
agement commands funds of its own amount-
ing to £273,000; 51? p.c. on them would
give 10 p.c. on capital, but slightly more
than 8 p.c. would be required to maintain
the recent 35 p.c. dividend rate. In view
of the sudden 50 p.c. increase of capital, it
seems too much to expect that the co. will
do relatively so well for a time as it has done
lately. That is, of course, unless a series
of bumper seasons and good markets give
large commission earnings, and unless oppor-
tunities for highly profitable investment
await all the new funds. A good run was
experienced last year, though in the earlier
portion the outlook was darkened by un-
favorable weather conditions which cur-
tailed marketings. Wool sales were smaller
than for some years :—•

The recovery of values, however —for live-
stock as well as for wool-clips—gave an
aggregate cash turnover equal to the pre-
vious year’s, and gross profits, less provision
for taxes, doubtful accounts, etc., totted up
£97,073, compared with £93,486 for 1923
and £69,628 for 1922. After taking £l5OO
for a staff provident fund, the net profit to
be cut up was more than 25 p.c. on the
£lOO,OOO of paid capital. Younghusband’s
developed great strength during the war;
there was no rush to distribute the abnormal
profits then made. In 10 years to March
31 last, after allowing for the latest divs.,
£94,250 had been added to visible reserves
and £91,083 had been distributed among
shareholders. On the basis of figures at
March 31 (less divs.), and taking in the
share-premiums, paid capital when increased
to £150,000 will be represented by a surplus

Many difficult construction problems have been
solved by the use of Pioneer Wood Pipe. Its light
weight, which is only a third as much as metal
pipe, enables it to be easily hauled over bad tracks
into almost inaccessible country. It can be unloaded
and laid by a few men without the use of derricks.
There are no joints to make nor rivets to place, and
it involves no costly caulking. Pioneer Wood Pipe
can claim many further advantages. Send for our

The new “log” suggested for Broken Hill
includes: —
(1) Everything to be done by day labor, and no
payment by results; (21 the mines to be worked
only six hours per day; (3) 30 hours to be a
week’s work underground and 35 hours on the sur-
face, three hours’ crib-time (36 minutes per day)
making the working times 27 and 32 hours respectively ;
(4) minimum pay to be £5 10s. per week; (5) over-
time to be paid for at extra rates, the new extra
rates varying from 17.] per cent, to 300 per cent,
according to the circumstances ; (6) each man to have
12 days’ holiday annually on full pay, also all
gazetted or proclaimed holidays, and election and
referendum days; (7) every employee who offers
himself for work to “be guaranteed a week’s pay at
prescribed rates irrespective of the fact that such
employee may have worked less than half the pre-
scribed number of hours in any week.”
No. 7 is rather vague, but it seems to imply
that fairly regular absence from work won’t
necessarily affect the pay. The only other
demand is for an “an effective voice” in the
control of the industry—as though it wasn’t
pretty effectively controlled already through
Parliaments and Arbitration Courts. More
than half of the mining industry of N. S.
Wales has in fact been controlled right out
of existence.

Six months ago the B. H. Prop, undertook
to treat Block 14’s ore. It meant giving a
pledge to the Port Pirie smelters to wipe
out a first mortgage of £12,000 and
giving the Prop, a second mortgage of
£20,000 to provide funds. Since then lead
and zinc have boomed, and what looked to
be a forlorn-hope deal has turned out a good
bargain. With metal prices up, a net profit
of £3140 has shown up instead of a loss
of £5669 for the previous six months. Mean-
while the debt to the Smelters has been
reduced to £8543, and apparently anything
owing to the Prop, is included in sundry
creditors of £3023. Having no current debts
worth counting beyond those creditors, and
with fuel and stores for £6122, sundry
debtors £8393, and ore in hand and cash
£1674, the Block 14 outlook has changed
entirely.

The latest N. S. Wales gold float is Belim-
bla Creek, near Nerrigundah (South Coast).
There are 150,000 shares of 2s. each ; vendors
take 60,000 fully-paids, and 90,000 contribs.,
which are to be fully called on allotment,
are offered to the public. The show is intro-
duced in a report by veteran Jos. Campbell
which is not in the least modest. He says
that the gold-bearing formation runs for 25
chains “with a proved width of at least 10ft.
and to a very considerable depth.” But be-
sides loaming and costeening the only work
done so far has been a 50ft. shaft at the
north end, from which a 75ft. drive has
given 150 tons averaging almost loz. 14dwt.
Another shaft 20 chains away and down 25ft.
has given “equally good results.” So, says
Campbell, Belimbla “can rely on a uniform
return from the whole mass of the lode of
Uoz.” And then :
Will it live to a great depth? Most assuredly,
as it came from below; and hence there is strong
reason for believing that the chemical agencies which
deposited the gold acted at a considerable depth.
You will, therefore, be safe in basing your calcula-
tions on this return [evidently the lloz.] for many
years to come ; and it is the best case that has come
under my notice for a quarter Of a century in which
gold-mining is an investment and not a speculation.
Stripped of Campbell’s enthusiastic out-
bursts, Belimbla does seem to have a good
chance; but to talk of the definite assurance
of l£oz. values at great depth from evidence
in the small amount of work done down to
50ft. is, of course, nonsense. Development
as far as it has gone has been satisfac-
tory, but much more must be done before the
find can justify Jos. Campbell’s poetical
rhapsody on the “golden treasures that there
abound.”
* * # *
Bribbaree, on the Stockinbingal-Forbes line
(N.S.W.), has dismantled the 10-head bat-
tery purchased at Sunny Corner, and will
soon begin transporting it. Dam excavation
is still under way. No mention is made
these days of the five-head battery on the claim
which the co. took over in August last year.
Development appears to be backward: 25
tons ore was the complement for the fort-
night covered by the latest report. No. 2
level west is in 35ft. from the winze, and
averages 15in. of “good quality stone.” No.
1 winze is 17ft. below the level, and “carries
a strong 4ft. reef of good values.” These
statements of values are very indefinite and
of no value in determining Bribbaree pros-
pects. What are the “good values” and
“good quality” measured in ounces or penny-
weights, and what is the value of the gold?
On the Crown field (N.S.W.) the South
Options has measured the lode intersected
in the tunnel. Manager Rolfe says that
after penetrating solid quartz for 17ft.. the
slates were met. The tunnel has been stopped
at 202 ft. and driving begun about the middle
of the lode. “We get gold wherever we try,”
he adds; but actual quantities and values
have yet to be proved. The Grown itself may
not have the real lode where it is experiment-
ing off its south tunnel, because the quartz
there is only from 3ft. to 4ft. wide, and
appears unlike the main Crown reef.
# * * *
Vimy Ridge (N.S.W.) has had a clean-
up at last: 135 tons have given 98oz. of
£4 gold. Three shifts w T ill now be worked
with five head of stamps, and manager C. It.
Mackenzie is confident of results when five-head
more are got in working trim. The directors
are issuing £5OO worth of 10 p.c. debentures
with which to pay for additional equipment.
* * * *
Y-Water, Emmaville (N.S.W.), still shows
£2538 on deposit and an old sluicing plant
which stands in the books at £BOll, but is
worth much less. The co. is on the look
out for a mining gamble, but there isn’t
much fresh to look to just now.

Collins House is out with its third or
fourth New Guinea Copper alias Laloki re-
construction. The case recalls that of the
Zinc Corporation, with the difference that
the B. H. South Blocks mine had more de-
fined possibilities. The financial plaster
applied to the Zinc Corp. by Hoover is to
be used on the New Guinea. It is proposed
to issue 75,000 £1 prefs., which are to carry
the same 10 p.c. cumulative pref.. privileges
as the 50,000 shares issued last year. They
will also have the right to participate pro-
portionally with the ordinaries in any surplus
profits, with first call for dividend arrears
and capital in a wind-up. In addition, each
share carries two votes. The new prefs.
differ from the old in that they are to get
back out of profits the cash put up, and after
that are to rank equally with other cum.
prefs. Holders of old prefs. have first call
on the new scrip, and then ordinary holders,
and if both fail the public will get a look in.
E. L. and C. Baillieu risk the underwriting
of the issue for a com. of Is. 3d. per share.
The only reason why existing prefs. agreed
to this arrangement can be that they are so
deeply involved that they must see the job
through. The new issue will increase capital
to £510,000, made up of 260,000 ordinaries
and 250,000 prefs. Erie Huntley says that
the smelting already done has shown that the
ores and fluxes are suitable, and that the
process will be successful with an efficient
blower. He considers that the trouble to
date has been “entirely due to relying upon
catalogue figures and installing inadequate
blowing machinery; with modern blowing
plant there will be no difficulties.” As it
has cost £500,000 to get thus far, and as
there are only 285,000 tons ore in reserve,
averaging approximately 5 p.c. copper and
21dwt. gold, no lightning calculator is needed
to explain why the latest lot of prefs, had to
be sugar-coated,

Carlisle, Bendigo, has continued its profit-
able weekly returns of over an ounce to the
ton since its Christmas-box find of rich spurs
at 1264 ft. After paying off a big debt it can
now buy its plant from the 8.A.G., and a com-
pressor is to be put in, costing up to £l6OO.
The mine must also make some provision
for crushing, as the B.A.G. will shortly close
the Koch’s battery. Possibly some leasing
arrangement can be made, otherwise the adja-
cent Carlisle battery may have to be bought.
If so, divs. are a good way off, especially if
the small weekly output of 60 to 100 tons
is not increased. The problem of the rising-
water may have to be tackled in the near
future, and that also gives a good reason for
increasing tonnage, which could easily be
done by putting on a second shift. The little
development work done has been somewhat
disappointing, and has not yet shown that
the rich spurs are more than a smallish
patch.
* * * *
Bendigo’s erstwhile premier mine, the
Garden Gully, has been repegged. The
B.A.G. closed it down some years back, and
finally abandoned the ground 18 months ago.
The repegging is probably due to the Car-
lisle’s rich patch of spiys at 1264 ft. In the
Garden Gully mine the rich 1447 ft. reef
showed only a west leg; the east leg was
represented by a body of spurs, worked with
moderate results by the co. and by tributors,
from the shaft southward. These spurs are
thought to be related to the Carlisle spurs
and are considered to warrant development
north of the shaft.
Bendigo is again talking of the possibili-
ties of divs. from New Red, White and Blue
on the strength of the better-looking spurs
showing on the western country south of No.
3 shaft. The good stone on which the last
market boost was engineered came from the
spurs in the slates lying east of the level,
the sandstone spurs to the west averaging
only 6dwt. However, work is cheap and
small profits have been pouched. So funds
are available to push ahead with an inter-
mediate level at 1540 ft. to pick up the shoots
of stone going underfoot from 1500 ft. The
main reef is also to be tested from a winze
at 1627 ft. south of No. 3 shaft. To sweeten
yields a hunt is to be begun after a run of
stone lying near the crosscourse in the south-
ern ground. This means 300 ft. of driving,
but so much gold was won on the fault that
the hazard of the work is worth taking.
“Fax” after a look-around: —
The State Electricity Commission of Victoria the
other day invited representatives of the press to
another inspection of Yallourn, somewhat prematurely
perhaps, since the great power station is still a
chaos of incompletion. Mud and untidiness are the
main features at present of the new district, whence
Melbourne and other centres are to draw electric
power, and an enormous output of brown-coal bri-
quettes is to free Victoria from the thraldom of
N.S.W. black-coal labor bosses. One looks at the
beginnings of a vast undertaking and thinks more
hands should be on the job. The State has
1500 men on the widespread works, or employed in
the Construction Branch, which builds pretty little
workmen’s houses, making bricks and tiles for the
building of them, and roads for the township apper-
taining to the works, everything being under S.E.G.
management. Furthermore, the contractor at the
works has another 300 men camped near the fields
of operations. Yet the future Tadmor seems to
want reinforcements to hurry it up; promise is far
in advance of performance at present. Yallourn
unquestionably has the goods —brown-coal deposits
sufficient for hundreds of years’ supply, and the
adjacent Latrobe River is ample for the S.E.C.’s
purpose. The vast plan, well thought out, is rich
in imagination; and, all going well with the
technical details, it must prove a great thing for
Victoria. The first despatches of current to Mel-
bourne are expected at the end of May.
The Great Unknown (W.A.) is being
given another trial. To the unwary this
show looks attractive on a casual inspection,
but in the last 15 years at least half a dozen
mining men, including Dorrie Doolette and
the late Bullant Mclntyre, after taking
crushings out, decided that it wasn’t. It is
in a most inaccessible spot back o’ the Yil-
gara field.
Mistletoe, near Meekatharra (W.A.), has
been optioned by a Melbourne crowd. Rich
pockets giving IOOOoz. and more have been
unearthed in this show during the past
year, and the other day two more small ones
were struck. There are some hundreds of
tons of ore in sight, said to run to “ounces
per ton,” but the shoot is of a type that is
usually short-lived.
Brilliant (W.A.) has taken another option.
This time it has agreed to sample Gnow’s
Nest, at Yalgoo, which has produced about
£60,000 gold to date. The vendor co. wants
£2500 and 10,600 shares for its assets.
* * * *
Things are not bright on the Hodgkinson
(Q.). The Tyrconnell is applying for ex-
emption ; it wants to raise further capital,
despite recent crushings giving 181 oz. from
215 tons. It is proposed to raise £3OOO
by the issue of £25 three-year deben-
tures, interest 12 p.c. Meanwhile, the
Minnie Moxham mine is being given another
try, but nobody is over-enthusiastic about
prospects. The early-day miners seem to
have made the most of the Hodgkinson, and
they knew when to leave.
An attempt to boom a new find near Silver
Valley, Herberton (N.Q.), has received a
check; the lode has cut out. The district’s
silver-lead interests are stagnant; most of
the mines have been worked down to the
zinc level, and though silver values in the
lodes are frequently high, the absence of
treatment plants prevents successful opera-
tions.
That Briseis (Tas.), run by an English
co., is going slow with tin production and
not taking advantage of a favorable metal
market is the firm conviction of a number
of Australian shareholders. They believe
that with a vigorous policy the old show
should be winning good profits and paying
divs. from the ground made available by
Lindesay Clark’s great engineering feat of
diverting the Ringarooma River, and some
of them are talking of approaching the Eng-
lish Board with a request to “Please ex-
plain.” There is an Australian Board con-
sisting of Alex. Peacock and General Hughes,
but though fees are still paid their place in
the Briseis scheme is indefinite; in fact, so
far as shareholders know, there have been
no recorded Board meetings since the Gen-
eral went Hun-shooting. The general opinion
of shareholders who know the property is
that yields could be increased sufficiently to
give divs., and most of them refuse to be-
lieve the rumor that the English Board is
holding off in the expectation of the tin-
market improving, which is quite a gamble,
of course.
A recent discovery at Mt. Mary’s (Tas.),
in the Cygnet apple district, is claimed to
have opened up a lode averaging l|oz. gold.
It has the blessing of one of the Electrolytic
Zinc officials, who has become manager of
the co. formed to develop the show. The
find has given an impetus to prospecting in
the district, and all likely spots are being
raked.

Tongkah Compound No. 2, having got out
of debt to vendors, has commenced to show
results. The 1023 campaign saw 783,827 c.
yd. go through the boxes for 259| tons oxide,
or 0.7401 b. per yd. This average is a shade
poorer than for the previous run, and costs
went up to £B3 a ton oxide from £76. How-
ever, better metal prices gave full compensa-
tion ; so after settling for royalties the co. had
£30,498 with which to meet costs and charges,
and £9243 was left. The directors wrote oft
£3317 of preliminary exes, and voted £3BOO
for depreciation. Everything has gone well
since December, so a Is. div. was distributed
in March, and a regular flow of profits to
shareholders is now looked for. With fib.
ground available and costs at per yd. a
pretty wide margin has to disappear before
values shrink to the expenses level. Still, it
is plain that Tongkah No. 2 is only a shadow
of old Tongkah Compound.

MARIE: “Of course; and we would ! get on splendidly,

“Gouger”: As an offset to the malingerers,
army doctors could tell of many Diggers who
concealed their wounds, or tried to. In the
Egyptian Government hospital, Alexandria,
the man in the next bed to me had been
brought in with a bullet in the lung. Under
the X-rays they discovered also a bullet m
the fleshy part of the thigh, the wound com-
pletely healed up. The patient told me
later across the beds that he’d got the bullet
in the thigh three days after the Landing at
Gallipoli. It had not given him much
trouble, and had soon healed up, so, as he
“didn’t want to leave the mob,” he said
nothing about it. Another man in my regi-
ment carried a bullet in his arm right
through the Peninsula. It “shifted,” and was
extracted at Maadi eight months later. But
to ignore even the slightest wound on Gal-
lipoli was to take a big chance. Our m.o.
had repeatedly warned us to come to him,
however trifling the injury, on account of the
germs in that graveyard of centuries. 1
got the merest flick across the kneecap from
a tiny flying shell-splinter; it raised one
drop of blood, which I wiped away. ‘What
a fool I’d look to parade to the doc. with
that scratch!” I thought. But three days
later I was carried to him with a septic leg,
which it took him all his time to save.
“Skipper” : What happened to the lantern
which hung in the wardroom of the Aus-
tralia? During her long cruise in search
of Von Spee in 1915 the supply of matches
ran out and the lantern was installed as a
pipelighter. Late in 1916, when I went
aboard the cruiser in the Firth of Forth,
the lantern was still burning, and I was
assured by my host that as long as the ship
floated it would not be extinguished.

“Jacaranda” : One result of what is adver-
tised as “the Queensland section of the Em-
pire Baby Competition” has been the sur-
prising number of photos of well-developed,
beautiful children sent in from far out-back
northern and western districts. Many arc
of the second generation of Australian-born,
and some are of the third. Most of the
parents are probably aware that there are
learned savants convinced of the inability
of Northern Australia to populate itself be-
yond the second generation, but they are
cheerfully defying science. One of the prize-
winners was the 11th surviving child of the
family, and several were the fourth, fifth or
sixth. Not without discomfort, though, Uo
some of these best immigrants start on their
life’s journey. One mother pointed out that
her little competitor was born with the tem-
perature between 112 and 116 degrees. It
may be argued that no place is suitable for
children, or adults either, where the inhabi-
tants are so badly housed that they are com-
pletely at the mercy of the extremes of tem-
perature—either hot or cold. What is needed
is a genuine attempt to provide suitable
dwellings at a reasonable cost for the out-back
people; then, instead of a few heroic mothers,
sometimes under heartbreaking conditions,
rearing a few fine children, there would
soon be enough to dispel for all time the
fallacy about North Australia being un-
suitable for white people.

“Trallwm”: Agitated advertising agents
went the round of Melbourne newspaper
offices the other day calling in
a special lot of advertising
copy and stereos. The main
illustration depicted a swagger
sedan-pattern Ford disgorging a
passenger at the porte-cochere
of a palatial villa-mansion re-
cognisable as one of the orna-
ments of Melbourne’s show resi-
dential highway. The owner of
the house, it was explained, had
kicked against the use of the
picture, and was threatening all
sorts of things. A Ford, even
a closed-pattern Ford, asso-
ciated with that family man-
sion ! Not to be thought of!

“H.L.N.”: Kiandra, the Ma
State’s highest town, 5000 feet
above sea level, can beat Vic-
toria’s highest, Matlock, by a
thousand. Both are relics of
the earlier days of gold-mining;
but while Matlock’s grey and
wind-swept humpies are crumb-
ling away, Kiandra still thrives
a hardy ancient, the capital of
the mountain country where
starving stock find grass when
drought and heat beset the
Riverina; in summer many a
fine stock horse is hitched near
the old pub where the skis
are stacked across the raft-
ers in readiness for the
winter snow. But Matlock
gives an impression of greater
altitude than Kiandra. It
stands on a bald patch on the
crest of the Dividing Range, and
Matlock Hill commands a fine
view of the wild mountain coun-
try that extends from Mt. Buller
in the north to the lonely hog-back of the
Baw Baw Barge on the southern horizon.
Kiandra, on the other hand, though bleak
enough, is sheltered by the folding hills;
but it proves its bona fides by producing
heavy frosts in January.

deceased had lived in the same place for
three years, nobody knew his name and there
was nothing in his scanty effects to give a

could say no more than that he had paid
his rent regularly, lived a solitary life and
seemed to have no friends. The eating-

but nobody knew his name there. But for a
policeman remembering an occasion when the
poor devil had been charged with some trifling
offence he might have had to go to the
grave without a name; but the moniker he
had given in court was attached to him for
interment purposes.
“F.A.” • I question “Centurion’s” state-
ment (B - . S/5/’24) about a machine-gun
replacing the firing party at military execu-
tions. Up to 1918, at any rate, the confirm-
ing authority was responsible for the death
sentence being carried out, and he detailed an
officer, usually an A.P.M. of the Corps to
which the condemned soldier belonged, to act
for him. The squad was also detailed from
the same corps. The sentence was carried
out in an enclosure, and the rifles handed out
as the firing party marched in single file,
towards the entrance. Within the enclosure
a mark was made upon the ground witlnn
15 paces of the condemned man’s position, and
as soon as the leader reached this spot the
executing officer gave the orders: “Halt-
left [or right]—aim—fire—right [or left]
quick march.” The actual target was indi-
cated by a paper disc pinned to the prisoner s
tunic. The prisoner was given the option or
standing or sitting, but his face was always
covered. Half an hour before reveille was
the time usually set down for executions in
France.

“Tauwarra”: An old gag has come true
at last. A footsore recruiter, toiling pain-
fully along the beach in the Gulf District
(Papua), was trying to reach Kerema by
nightfall. “I catch’m Kerema sun-he-go-
down?” he inquired of a village policeman.
“You can’t catch’m, taubada,” answered the
nig. “Whaffor?” asked the white man—
“Kerema too far?” “He no too far,” was
the bright response. “Kerema close up
three far, I t’ink.”

“Veedee H.”: I’ve often wondered how
many wounded Diggers besides myself actu-
ally saw the lump of ironmongery that they
were about to provide with a billet. Our
crowd were in reserve trenches about half a
mile behind the front line, hidden from Fritz
by a slight rise. One afternoon we were
lining up, dixies in hand, for tea, when a
’plane passed overhead at a great height.
A few seconds later we heard a whizz-
ing sound, growing quickly louder and
louder. Looking up. I saw a black object
that seemed to be diving straight for the
centre of our mob. I had hardly time to
yell: “Drop, boys, it’s a bomb!” when the
explosion took place about 10 yards away.
I got my issue in the thigh, the only one
smacked, for the bomb had burst away from
us, and only a stray piece had back-pedalled.
The hardest part of it all came afterwards,
when I learned from a cobber in hospital
that it was one of our own ’planes that had
given me my ticket for Our trenches
had been mistaken for Fritz’s.

“Borom”: Military executions by machine-
gun fire instead of the usual firing party
(B. 8/5/’24) were tried in the early part
of 1916 in the British Expeditionary Force.
But even the shortest “burst” of fire made
such a ghastly mess of the subject that the
method was soon abandoned. Possibly its
abandonment was hastened by some vivid
and forceful articles in John Bull, by
Horatio Bottomley. In the German Army,
however, the machine-gun was used through-
out the war for military executions.
“I-lerodot” : It is understating the case to
suggest that bail is supplied for the criminal
element of Sydney by means of a common
pooling of financial resources (B. l/5/’24) ;
actually, sureties are furnished by a regu-
larly organised syndicate, of the existence
of which the police are perfectly well aware.
This organisation charges from £5 to £2O for
putting up bail for an arrested person. There
are several nominal bondsmen, one of them
a Surry Hills hotelkeeper. The syndicate
not only stipulates that its clients must be
known to and approved by one or other of
its members, but it keeps a sharp eye on all
those who have been accommodated, and at the
first suspicious move it withdraws the bond.
Some time ago a wealthy retired woman-
crook started the business of providing bail-
bonds up to £2O for arrested nymphs of the
pavement, at a charge of from one to three
a time. Just as she was building
up A profitable connection she fell foul of the
law herself, however, and retired to the
seclusion of Long Bay. Crooks rarely trust
one another well enough to finance their own
pool for emergency purposes.
“Topee’s” story of sin :
S’Africa was a good school for looting. My friends
Plummer and Briggs who had graduated there
arrived in Rabaul shortly after - the Occupation.
They were sworn in as military policemen and,
accompanied by a Malay clerk, were sent over to
German New Guinea to hold the fort at a settle-
ment till a district officer could be appointed.
They had orders to arrest the resident German
official and send him back by their boat; but as
the functionary, on sighting the steamer, had vacated

his bungalow and taken to the bush, their actn ities
had to find vent in other ways. Searching the
premises they were rewarded with two watches -
one an old Dent’s (London) gold lever, the other
an ornate affair of Hamburg brand in a chamois
bag. Winning the toss, Plummer chose the latter.
(The Melbourne Hebrew on whom he tried to pass it
next furlough referred him to a neighboring brass
foundry This by the way.) Returning to the
office they noticed a pock-marked, truculent-looking
Malay skipper bossing the loading of his auxiliary
ketch, and marked him down with a view to col-
lectin’g harbor dues next day. After searching the
office °without further luck, they sent their Malay
assistant to the Chinese store with 10s. to buy a bottle

of whisky. Refreshed by a couple of nips apiece they
sent him back again to summon the storekeeper to
the Presence, where he was charged with selling
liquor without a license! The defendant produced
his German trading permit in rebuttal. The Court
ignored this, and sentenced the offender to a fine
of £3O. Defendant offered £8 down in sovereigns
and the balance within a month. After consultation
the Court agreed to accept this offer and the clerk
duly collected the money. The storekeeper was, however,
told to bring his stock of spirits to the court-
house for safe keeping! As soon as the stuff arrived
the Court adjourned. About dawn next morning
Briggs was aroused by a tuff-tuff from the harbor.
He woke his senior with the news that the Malay
was tuning up. They rushed to the wharf to dis-
cover that the ketch was well in the passage leading
through the reef. Her skipper, not liking the cut
of the new officials’ jibs, had decided to go while
the going was good. Also, at the last moment, he
had embarked nine passengers—one compatriot clerk
and eight British sovereigns.
“Anaf ’ • The scandalous case cited by
“Little Nell” (B. l/5/’24)‘- in connection
with the boarding-out of State children does
not stand alone. A couple of years back
a woman already receiving payment from
the State for one child applied to have an-
other assigned to her. The application had
been granted when the police came along
with information to the effect that the
woman was known to be of ill-repute, and
was suspected of being a procuress. Of
course, this put an end to her employment
as a foster-mother; but what sort of an
investigation into the character of those
who apply for youngsters can be conducted
when such a happening as this is possible?
“P.M.”: Tlie Koenigin Luise wasn't the
only troopship that sailed packed with men
and short of water (B. 17/4/’24). In 1916
the Ulysses, which already had 2000 troops
aboard, took on an extra 400 from the Port
Lincoln, which had run aground at Sierra
Leone. All washing had to be done in sea-
water ; shaving was prohibited, and sentries
were posted at all the taps on the troop-
decks to see that not a drop of water was
pilfered or wasted.
“0.K.” after long suffering:—
The Federal Health Department advises sufferers
from catarrhal colds and influenza to get vaccinated
by “a qualified physician.” The Department’s stock
of vaccines is not going off as it should, Dr. Cump-
ston thinks, people being unaware of the benefit to
be got from coryza vaccine for catarrh, and the
“effective remedy” available in influenza vaccine.
Without contending that anti-influenza serum is
more of an experiment than a proved remedy, and
that all such serums are matters of medical dispute
as regards their ultimate effect, I would like to
pit my personal experience of the coryza treatment
against Dr. Cumpston’s advice. A series of four
punctures, at about four days’ intervals, is, at
a first trial, effective in most cases, if not all,
provided the vaccine be sufficiently strong and the
patient in a properly receptive state of health. My
experience tells me that I have received immediate
benefit in the autumn, say April, whereas vaccina-
tions in the Spring were worse than useless. The
good effect is limited to three months, or four at
the outside, and the period of susceptibility is limited
to two or three years. After that the physician may
stab without shifting two penn’orth of catarrh, while
one has become more than ever subject to the germ
owing to previous vaccinations. I have had eight lots
of vaccinations with the serum, or three to four
dozen injections in all. And now, after a first three
brief successes and several failures, I am reduced to
dieting myself for a living, otherwise chronic catarrh
would hand me over to 'flu for dismissal, and pneu-
monia would polish me off.
In the interests of surgical specialists the De-
partment may next start recommending the fashion-
able nasal operation, whereof I can also speak from
sad experience. The wonderful machine that removes
bone from the nostril, even as a mower cuts obtrusive
tufts from the lawn, makes a few patients better and
the majority worse. The operation creates more
trouble than it removes, apparently. If the busi-
ness of the profession were to prevent catarrhal dis-
eases instead of treating them with physics, vaccines
or operations, the advice to the world would be
shaped in the mode of Railway Commissioner Clapp’s
maxims-—-Eat less meat, chew brown bread, drink
Hot with meals and throw pastry to the dogs.
“Billy Cann”: Nearly “all the references
to Gallipoli I have ever read emphasise the
hard rations. Cer-
tainly bully beef,
biscuits, cheese and
odoriferous desic-
cated vegetables
held top place in
the menu ; but the
private caches of
the A.S.C. con-
tain ed other
articles. On one
occasion, when a
few of us had been
allotted a job that
looked a certain
“stonker,” som c-
body said, “Weil,
this will be your

you well.” They
turned out roast
pheasant, green
peas, beans and
asparagus from
shining glass jars,
and we dined
luxuriously for
once. The whole
came mysteriously
from the stores. It
wasn’t the last feed for any of the diners,
either, for the stunt was entirely successful.
* * * *
“Bogota”: “C.G.C.’s” imperfect acquaint-
ance with Spanish is possibly to blame for
his belief that in Colombia condemned pri-
soners are executed by having their heads
smashed flat with a block of stone (B,
l/5/’24). As in most other American re-
publics, the official instrument of execution
in Colombia is the garotte. A steel ring
goes round the neck of the condemned man,
and death is caused by fracturing the verte-
brae, which is quite as efficacious as liang-
ging and probably more humane. When I
was last in Colombia three men were gar-
otted, the executions being carried out pri-
vately inside one of the prisons. I have
heard that despatch by shooting is an alter-
native, and that prisoners are sometimes
permitted to choose between this method and
“el garotte.” Colombia is a fairly progressive
country, and probably the apparatus that
“C.G.C.” saw was a relic of one of £he
periods of barbarity with which the place
was afflicted from 70 to 100 years ago.
“D.” after a Pleasant Sunday afternoon
in the Sydney Domain:—
(1) The chief speakers were “Poms.”
(2) The more abusive the orator the bigger his
audience. The largest crowds were those surrounding
Australia’s most embittered Scot, Donald Grant, and
a typical East End Cockney who devoted himself to
flagellating Rome: the smallest gathering (consisting
of an old lady and a couple of children) faced a
benign-looking ancient who in the cultured tones
of an Oxford den was conducting a Gospel Mission.
(3) Though practically everybody had a grievance
against Rome (including a prohibitionist and a
diminutive Hebrew whose subject was the Palestine
mandate, but excepting the Rev. Carr-Smith and the
gentle old Gospeller above mentioned) that much-
reprobated institution was unrepresented.
(4) No one was either enthused or annoyed by the
roaring fulminations of the propagandists. If such
challenging remarks were hurled about publicly in,
say, France, there would be riots; here, the
strongest step taken to express displeasure consists
in leaving the congregation for another.
(5) The habitual pursuer of refreshment in the
Domain has the strongest stomach for fustian in the
Empire.
“Dido” : He was an arid citizen in broken
boots and an impecunious hat, and he hur-
ried on the heels of the brawler who had just
challenged the whole street to mortal combat.
The brawler led him into a bar, and I fol-
lowed to see what was doing. I don’t know
what led the semi-vagrant to confide in me,
but he did. “I always follow a quarrelsome
bloke into a pub,” he said, “because he’s
pretty sure to start a fight, and when there’s
a fight on in a bar you can drink anybody’s
beer.”
From Edward Denman, of “The Buffs” :
It may interest those who have joined in beefing
out “It’s a Long, Long Way to Tipperary” to learn that
that ditty was first set to martial music by the
bandmaster of the East Kent Regiment, “The Buffs,”
from whom the score was obtained by a number of
bandmasters of other regiments, who played it many
times before the late war. “The Buffs” is the oldest
regiment in the British Army, and in the course of
its long career it is one of the very few famous
regiments that have been connected in any wav
with Australia. It was first raised in 1572 from the
trained bands of London, and paraded before Queen
Elizabeth. In 1672 it was given authority “to recruit
at all times within the city of London by beat of

drum,” and is the only infantry regiment in the
British Army that can march through London “with
fixed bayonets, drums beating and colors flying.”
The only other corps of any sort enjoying the privi-
lege are the Honorable Artillery Company, the Royal
Marines and the 3rd Battalion of the Grenadier
Guards. “The Buffs” fought under Marlborough,
formed part of the army of occupation in Paris
from 1815 to 1818, furnished the storming party
for the Redan during the Crimean War, and were
stationed in Australia in 1823. It was the first
regiment to enter Bagdad and hoist the Union Jack
there. This flag was later presented to it, and now
reposes with the war-worn colors, and many oi
its captured trophies, in Canterbury Cathedral.
ROSE-MAGIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Rain and yellow sun
Have made a rose.
Out of the brown earth won,
Its sweetness flows
Like the touch of fingers
Fondling me
Or the thought that lingers
liauntingly
Of an old song sung.
Shy and tenderly young
Is the moving air
In this green place
Whi r e magic is creeping.
fehould the rose lift a -face
As tenderly fair
As her fragrance around me,
Would I wake from my .sleeping,
From long dreams that Pound me?
Would I taste of her lips
What the bee never sips—
Dream dew of dream dew—
And find all that sweetness
In utter completeness
Was you—always you?

“R.G.N.C.” : Reference to Mormonism (B.
l/5/’24) recalls that Victoria might have
been the land for Latter-Day Zionism to
bloom in. Brigham Young visited the colony
somewhere in the early ’sixties, and left a
colleague behind as apostle. The chosen
scene was a fishing village on Westernport
Bay known as Queensferry. A small com-
pany of Saints exists there to this day, a
group of families which still practise the
rites of the sect tempered by Australian
modernism, and diluted with the dogmas of
better-known churches. The apostle had off-
spring, who married among district settlers.
A daughter was held locally to be something
of a prophetess in her own right, and her
home served as ritual headquarters.
Philip Collier is the 14th Premier of West-
ralia since responsible government arrived
in 1891. The longest-lasting of his prede-
cessors were Bigjohn Forrest, who ran the
show for 10 years; Jack Scaddan, who en-
dured for nearly five; and Jimmy Mitchell,
who held on from May, 1919, till the other
day. This only leaves 13 years for the re-
maining 10, or an average of about 16
months apiece. Ex-Premiers of W.A. still
in being, besides Scaddan and Mitchell, are
A. E. Morgans and Walter James, K.C.
(Perth), Rason, Newton Moore, Agent-
General Colebatch (London) and H. B.
Lefroy, the squatter-squire of Walebing.

“Bogong”: Speaker Bowser, of Vic., is
one of the absent-minded sort. At Wan-
garatta, where he runs the Chronicle, this
little weakness is fairly well known. For
years, as a bachelor, he boarded at the Wan-
garatta Hotel, and one day after his mar-
riage he turned up at the pub and sat down
to lunch. It was not until he was half-way
through the meal that he remembered he
should be eating at home. To get about
the township he used a push-bike, and every
now and again would leave it on the foot-
path outside a shop and wander off to an-
other establishment. Later he would com-
plain to the police that his bike had been
stolen, though it was waiting docilely where
he had originally left it. This happened so
often that at last the local sergeant yawned
whenever a report arrived anent Bowser’s
stolen bicycle.
Anthony Plow-Kane, who died in Mel-
bourne the other day after a long career in
the Vic. Health Department, was a nephew 7
of the Canadian magnate, Lord Mount
Stephen, whose wife was a sister of pictur-
esque old parson Plow-Kane, a man of varied
and unexpected gifts v r ho was once chaplain,
to Victoria’s little army and held a seat on
the Board of the Colonial Mutual Life. Be-
fore his death Mount Stephen cut up a large
portion of his estate among near relatives to
avoid heavy probate, and some of his money
came to Australia. The late Anthony was
a keen sport, and had long been a member
of the M.C.C. and V.R.C.
The M.11.R. for Herbert (Q.) :
Premier Theodore of Queensland is to be denied
the pleasure of taking a fall out of the ancient
Bamford, M.H.R. for Herbert, at the next election.
Long before Theodore’s invasion of the Federal arena
was mooted, Bamford, who has reached 75, had
decided that this would be his last Parliament, and
he is not likely to change his mind, though the
prospect of a tough tight wouldn’t chill his blood.
Bamford is one of the garnest battlers the Nation'll
Parliament has known. He was the first of the
old Labor party to advocate conscription in 1915.
He also belled the cat in favor of the 1920 salary
increase. Killen and Gabb, the most persistent
opponents of the grab in the present House, are still
declaring that they are overpaid for their services,
but elsewhere Bamford’s action has been enthusi-
astically endorsed by men who hadn’t the pluck to
fire the first shot. Last week the patriarch took
the Chair, owing to the sickness of Watt, and it
was appropriate that he, who is one of the few
remaining relics of the first Parliament, should
receive Bruce’s congratulations on its 23rd birthday.
Among recent passengers for England are
G. A. Stuckey, 8.E., B.Sc., and Miss Butler,
who go to prepare the way for Mr. Bradfield,
engineer of the North Shore Bridge. Stuckey,
though only 24, has some brilliant achieve-
ments to his credit. He won his first bur-
sary at the 1913 intermediate exam., matri-
culating two years later with one of the best
passes in the State ; and he gained top place
in the public service and in the State bur-
saries. After his first year at Sydney ’Var-
sity he was awarded a Coutts scholarship
and secured bursaries for four years in suc-
cession. In 1918 he carried off the Barker
scholarship and the Norbert Quirk prize for
Maths. 11. and the Slade prize in Physics.
He got his B.Sc. in 1919 and his B.E. two
years later. He resigned a lecturership at
St. Andrew’s (Sydney) to go into the Rail-
way Construction branch, where he became
associated with Mr. Bradfield, whose right-
hand man he has been in planning for the
Harbor bridge.
“J.W.”: The Red Page article on Nell
Gwynn (B. l/5/’24) is a reminder that
there are descendants in Australia of Dr.
Thomas Tenison, afterwards Archbishop of
Canterbury, who read the burial service
over “Sweet Nell” when he was vicar of St.
Martin’s-in-the-Fields. This cleric died
leaving no male descendant, but his only
daughter married a Smith, a landowner of
that period, and the Tenison-Smiths eventu-
ated. The family home is in Cambridgeshire
(Eng.) ; a direct descendant, Gordon Teni-
son-Smith, lives near Crookwell (N.S.W.).
Arthur O’Conner, who died the other day,
was a familiar figure at Melb. law courts
for years as associate to one or other of
the Supreme Court judges. He was a con-
nection of the family of Cussen, J., but didn’t
delve so deeply into law as ’S’onor. After
office hours music was O’Conner’s chief de-
light; but he was a good talker as well as
singer and made an entertaining host or
guest. One son is a sub-prof, at Brisbane
’Varsity;- the other is in the Commonwealth
Bank.
The Joneses who are meenisters in Vic.
could make up a cricket team of their own.
At the recent Scotchbyterian assembly in
Melbourne there were nine of them. Vic.
has a Jones at the head of its Forestry Com-
mission, another controlling the Lunacy De-
partment, a third in command of the Labor
party in the Uppah Chambah, and not long
ago had one as second Railway Commis-
sioner. Incidentally, if the railway Jones
laid lived Clapp would never have been
heard of in these parts.
Died at Hobart, James Honey, the last
full-pay officer of the original Imperial
regime in Tasmania. He was reputed to be
102 years old, and_ probably was: he came
to the Speck in 1825, and entered the service
14 years later. Honey spent two years in
Norfolk Island in the ’fifties, and, returning
to Hobart, climbed to the job of paymaster
of Imperial pensions, from which he retired
in 1895.
“Sturt Street": When Ballarat College
celebrates its diamond jubilee next month
there will be many affectionate references
to “Johnny” Garbutt, for so long headmaster
of the school. Sundry grizzled citizens
throughout the Commonwealth had the bene-
fit of Garbutt’s teaching, and bore away with
them some mordant or humorous nickname
which he had inflicted on them while they
were under his care. A prominent bank
manager in Hobart (Tas.) was early christ-
ened “Tauri Oculi” on account of his pro-
minent eyeballs, while another citizen in
South Aus. will probably remember that lie
was dubbed “Minimus Minimus” because he
never seemed to grow up. Garbutt was a
persistent punster, and the most popular lads
were those who laughed loudest at his jests ;
but he was highly regarded, nevertheless.
“Jacaranda”: Queensland will have three
more nonagenarians shortly—if the unspeak-
able northern climate permits—viz., George
Woolnough, F. T. Brentnall and James
Cowlishaw, all three connected at some
time in some capacity with the Bris-
bane Telegraph. Woolnough gave up being
editor about eight years ago, after holding
the job for 30 ; but he has by no means put
aside the pen yet. The other two have been
—mnd are still—more intimately connected
with the commercial side. Of the trio only
Cowlishaw is Australian-born; of Wooi-
nough’s 70 years in Australia and Brent-
nail’s 60, most have been spent in Queens-
land. Woolnough and Brentnall were both
Methodist parsons, and both have been mem-
bers of the now abolished Upper House. All
are still hale and vigorous.
Jack Billson, Fitzroy’s choice in Vic.
Assembly for 23 years, has been made chair-
man of the Railway Standing Committee—
which means £3OO added to his £5OO a year
as M.P. This is the first time a Labor man
has got the job. It was pretty well under-
stood that Billson would be appointed after
Labor had helped Weaver, of the Cocky
party, to whip McDonald, a Liberal nominee.
The new member is the ablest of the half-
dozen on the committee. He has been De-
puty-Opposition leader for 20 years or there-
abouts, except for 13 days in 1913. when
he was Minister of Railways in Elmslie’s
Labor Government.
The new sec. to the Adelaide Stock Ex*
change in place of West, who goes to Europe
as manager of the S.A. Olympic rowing team,
is F. H. Wray. He is only 28, and has been
in the civil service from boyhood, except for
over four years at the war, during part of
which he was attached to Australian H.Q.
in France.
JIM BELTON, Tasmanian Minis-
ter of Lands and Works, who has keen
representing the Speck at the confer-
ence of Ministers of Agriculture in
Sydney.
Capt. A. J. Cooper, who years ago brought
the Potosi, Sorata and other mailsliips to
Australia, died recently and left a message to
be passed on to Australia:—
I regret, owing to physical disabilities, that I
have not been able to write the concluding volume
of “Solectrics,” though I have gathered the data.
The causes of volcanic action and of earthquakes
are fully accounted for; but nature is in no hurry,
and it will probably be a hundred years before that
part of the theory is understood.
Capt. Cooper worked out a great number
of solectric calculations, and, among other
things, issued a warning of the earthquake at
Valparaiso many years ago. He, of course,
met with a large amount of opposition and
some ridicule; but that made no difference—
he believed that “science will some day demon-
strate to warring mankind that this beautiful
earth could be made a happy one,” and that
was the one end for which the sterling seaman
strove —he wanted the world to be able to
carry on its business “without bringing tears
to the eyes of widows and orphans.”
H. A. McCoy, son of the Director of Edu-
cation in S. Aus., who took his degree at
Sydney, and was a house surgeon at Adel-
aide Hospital till 1922, has just bagged a
diploma for medical radiology and electrology
at Cambridge. He is doing research work at
a couple of hospitals in London, and intends
to collect further experience in Germany and
the U.S.A. before returning to Australia.
In South Aus. Digger members of the law
profession are getting a fair share of the
plums. Eric Millhouse, ex-gunner, is now
Crown Prosecutor. Three of the last four
stipendiary magistrates appointed—Haslam,
Ronald and Muirliead —are ex-soldiers. Edgar
Bean, another, has been appointed Assistant-
Parliamentary Draughtsman. Ex-Sergeant
George Ligertwood has filled the vacancy
in the old-established firm of Baker, Glynn
and Co., created by the departure of Napier,
K.C., for the Bench. Finally, the recent
elections made Bill Denny Attorney-General.
“The Deacon”: “Ex-Dig.” (B. 8/5/’24)
writes of the youngest nurse in the war.
What about the oldest? Mary Duffy, who
held some claim to fame as the nurse who
brought Governor Duff to Sydney in a by-
gone age and saw him buried, was with the
A.I.F. when her years were in the vicinity
of 70.
Two, at any rate, of the defeated M's.L.A.
of Westralia have lost no time in returning
to. their old jobs. Rufus Underwood has gone
mining out by Marble Bar, and Mullany is
back on a dray.
Sir Michael O’Dwyer, ex-Governor of the
Punjab, whose libel suit against Sir Chettus
Sankaran Nair in London is raking up the
unhappy Amritsar affair, has two brothers
in Australia. One was rector of St. Pat’s
College, Melbourne, and the other was head
of Xavier before taking over command Of
Newman College at Melbourne ’Varsity.
The N.S.W. Soudan contingent lost an-
other survivor when Jonas Goode Nelson
died at Goulburn the other day at 73. A
brother, who also went to interview Fuzzy-
Wuzzy, still lives at Liverpool. Their father
was that Constable Nelson who was shot by
bushranger Dunn at Collector.
A REVISED HEAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sir Arthur Conan Doyle states that out of 10
A his relatives and friends killed in the war, eight
have communicated with him through spiritualistic
mediums. He adds that the Red Indian ‘happy
hunting-grounds’ and the ‘Elysian Fields’ of the
Greeks and Romans are far nearer the truth, con-
cerning the life after death, than the Christian
belief.”
Good on you, Conan ! Literary dad
Of Sherlock Holmes, may Heav’n send you’re right!
1 never yearned to be an angel clad
In robes and loose effects of shimmering white;
A sweater and some pants of shepherd’s plaid
Will satisfy my tastes sartorial quite
As well —and be more comfortable far—
When I have “crossed the Bar.”
Why should I want to hit the track, deceased,
For realms where stately anthems peal and ring ?
Where’s the attraction in a promised feast
Of song for one who never learned to sing
A note, and can’t distinguish in the least
Quid Gloriaris from “God Save the King”?
What odds to me if harps are there in gluts?
I couldn’t harp for nuts.
If concerts always grated on you, if
You couldn’t sit the finest opera through,
This Heav’n of hymns and halos —do not sniff
So pityingly, but try to get my view—-
Wouldn’t the prospect of it bore you stiff?
You shudder. Yes, anl that’s what I might do
With choirs celestial to drone at me
Through all eternity.
I should esteem the Indian hunting-grounds
A meeter prize for righteousness and grace.
Give me an Arcady where game abounds
And all the thrill and gladness of the chase
From morn till even —horses, too, and hounds
That aren’t admitted to the Other Place—
Nor will I grudge more sedentary guj 7 s
Their mansions in the skies.
Or Fields Elysian where the poet finds,
The while he lolls on beds of asphodel,
The pleasant company of kindred minds
Prepared to listen or intent to tell,
Immortals like himself. Pull down the blipds
On New Jerusalem! Here’s one would dwell
For pref’rence in Valhalla’s halls, or trail
Towards Avilion’s vale.
No need, my worthy friend, to be annoyed
Or glare at me askance or get the spike.
I quite admit I might be better employed
Than in conjecturing what Heav’n is like,
Still, till your spirit streaks across the void,
You never know for sure what luck you’ll strike.
Wherefore I hope and trust the spooks of Doyle
Gave him the dinkum oil.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Herodot”: “Sarah’s” stockman who dug
out an aching tooth and stopped the bleeding with
a live coal (B. iO/4/’24) is easily beaten by a
New Guinea prospector who died at the age of close
on 70 3'ears a while back. About 20 years ago he
was in Dutch New Guinea, and as the result of a
small spear-wound just above the left wrist, septi-
csemia set in. The nearest white aid was over 100
miles away, and knowing that it was impossible to
get there in time to save his life, he decided to
amputate the infected limb himself. He carried a
fairly-extensive medicine-chest, but it lacked a saw
with which to sever the bone, so he used a pocket-
knife that had a saw-blade. After showing one of
his “boys” how to apply a tourniquet on the brachial
artery, he cut through the flesh, midway between
the elbow and the wrist, leaving a flap to sew
over the stump, and then sawed through the bone.
He fainted several times, but on recovering con-
sciousness each time he tackled the job again, and
finally completed it. All that he had to relieve
the pain was some tincture of opium. He took a
large dose of this after the operation was over, then
fainted again. Having rested for three or four days
he set out for the coast, and eventually arrived at
one of the Dutch settlements. Subsequently the
stump of his arm was trimmed down and sewn up
properly by a doctor, and it was not long before it
had healed completely.
“St. Kitts”: “Hayseed” (B. 3/4/’24) was
talking through his hat when he said anything cold-
blooded is immune to snakebite. Recently I chanced
upon an argument between a death-adder and a small
’goanna. As the ’go. was giving away a good deal
of weight I interfered on his behalf and killed the
adder. Having thus disposed of his adversary I
turned round to receive the heartfelt thanks of
the ’go. But I got none, the main reason being
that he was as- dead as Julius Cssar’s grandma.
Certainly he may have died from heart failure due
to the excitement of watching the mix-up between
the adder and myself, but as he had a couple of
punctures in the back of his neck the coroner’s
verdict was “Death from snakebite.”
* * * *
“Ragar”: “The Jumper” (B. 24/4/’24)
speaks of termites adding small sections to their
nssts here and there, and “continuing the process
till the building period is finished.” Just when is
that time? Neither in N. Queensland, the Gulf
Country, nor in the islands adjacent to northern
Australia, have I found a close
season for the termite’s operations,
building or otherwise. But I
agree with “The Jumper” that
“Valamac” (B. 20/3/’24) was
badly astray when he said they
foretell weather changes by their
building activities. My experience
is that, though the termite is
first and last a night-worker, as
“The Jumper” says, it also is
ready to turn to and build at
any time during the 24 hours.
Has anyone ever seen termites
making an opening in the hard,
weather-worn outer casing of their
nest from within ? I’ve seen them
actually building new “wings”
but, though I have watched care-
fully and repeatedly, I have never
seen them make the breach. Where
do they get the necessary moisture
to work the building material
with in drought time? I’ve cut
the pinnacles off the tops of ter-
mites’ nests when the country was
as hot and dry as the hobs of
Hades, but always the repairing
poultice would be in position
within a few hours as fresh and
moist as though there was water
in the vicinity. These poultices
are surprisingly heavy too; one
I weighed turned the scale at a
fraction under 51b. and measured
33in. round—and the job was done
between 3 p.m. and 10 a.m. the following day.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: Tell “Saaedi” (B.
10/4/’24) that I know a man who once hustled
400 weaners over 24 miles in a shade over 7i
hours. There is, of course, a vast difference between
chasing a handful of strong, fresh sheep over a
good road for one day and making a pilgrimage
extending over months through all kinds of country
with barely enough feed to keep the animals moving;
and records of droving to be of any value should be
considered in the light of the conditions under which
the job is done as well as the distance actually
traversed.
* * * *
“Sikiana” (Solomon Is.) : Recent refer-
ences to Black Brother’s tender-heartedness remind
me. As we were overhauling the ketch, and the
skipper and mate were living ashore with me, I
had to keep an eye on the cook boy. Early in
the afternoon I decided on grilled chicken for the
following day’s breakfast. So I called the cook
and said: “Jimmy, time sun he die, you killem two
fella cockarocks.” About 3 o’clock we returned to
DOING THE FAIR THING.
MISSUS: “Wot 'are yer brought ’ome the two pairs of boxin’-
gloves for?”
HUSBAND : “I've been thinkin’ I ain't altogether been givin’ yer
a fair deal. I’m goitern ’ter teach yer all I know.”
the house, and I saw the two chickens nicely cleaned
hanging under the house. I yelled to the boy:
“What name you killem fowl! You no hear me
talk time sun he die?” The kid poked the chickens
with his finger and as one of them gave a very
feeble flutter he calmly remarked, “Me no killem;
me only take out hair belong him.” The young
cannibal had plucked them alive.
“Lobjc”: “Bonragi’s” stereotyped adden-
dum (B. 17/4/’24) to my remarks re the Papuan’s
■cruelty leaves me stone-cold^—even though it may be
perfectly true. My complaint was directed at the
tacit condonation of both missions and Administra-
tion, who, though the one is morally and the other
legally bound to suppress cruelty, deliberately over-
look it, and satisfy their consciences by using the
same argument as “Bouragi” advances—“He Re.,
the native] is no more blameworthy for the blood-
curdling things he does than a baby is for hauling
a kitten round by the tail.” The inference is that
the native has the mentality of a baby; yet this
baby, who must not be blamed for his fiendish cruelty
to dumb creatures, is judged worthy of being put in
charge of a mission school, of holding high rank
in the Armed Native Constabulary, of running Govern-
ment launches, and of doing a thousand and one other
jobs. I am not, of course, speaking of the bush-
men ; and I was quoting the case of a native mission-
ary in the par. to" which “Bouragi” refers. If Black
Brother can. be taught to do all the useful things
he is taught to do, he can also be taught not to
inflict needless pain upon animals. It is noticeable
that whenever the missions or the Administration
seek to enforce some ordinance which will allegedly
improve the conditions of the native—generally to
the detriment of the country’s progress—Black
Brother’s wonderful adaptability, skill, business
ability and general brain power are held up for
public admiration; but when the authorities are
excusing any unfortunate traits in the character of
their charges the general explanation is a shrug,
raised eyebrows, and “But what else can you expect
from a child ?”
* * * #
“Picko”: I am not looking for any fancy
bets, but I’ll make a plain statement. Tell “Linde-
say” (B. 17/4/’24) that his man can not put up
400 posts in a day. Assuming that the ordinary
summer day referred to is from 6 a.m. till 7 p.m.,
with an allowance of one hour for smokos, the
time worked equals 12 hours. For every lmin.
48see. of those 12 hours a post-hole has to be sunk,
post lifted, sighted and rammed. This, coupled
with the fact that the fencer has to pace or measure
the panels and set up the necessary strainers is, on
the bare face of it, a physical impossibility. It
migjit be possible to put up a few posts at the
rate of 400 a day; that’s an entirely different
matter. As for “Mulla” (B. 10/4/’24) whose man
can do 440 in a day. Well- !
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: I can’t recall an in-
stance of one dead snake being carried away by its
mate (“Nitric” B. 10/4/’24), but I know of a case
in which a dead bird was carried off by its relatives.
A nephew of mine knocked down with a stick a
young black-throated butcher-bird. I fixed up a
nest for it on the verandah, but it died of its
injuries. When I went to do the undertaking next
morning I found that the parent birds had removed
their dead baby from the nest and dropped it
beneath a tree a short distance from the house
where they had often fed the youngster. Whether
the corpse was carried oif for sentimental reasons or
not I don’t know.
* * * *
“FY7”: “Hamer” errs in saying the scien-
tists claim that all the
eels in the world hare
a common spawning
ground in the Atlantic
(B. 17/4/’24). That
claim was made for the
European eel only.
Years of research
proved that eels mate
and spawn only at
great depths. Our eels
spawn somewhere in
the deeps off the Aus-
tralian coast; but no
one so far has put their
Agapemone on the
map. Every Spring the
young eels (elvers)
ascend the rivers by
millions climbing
waterfalls and every-
thing that comes in
their way. They have
often been observed and
described in The Bul-
letin by Abo. writers.
The vast majority
ascending the rivers
are females. They
come down again in
the autumn, and with
the males resort to
deep water, where both
die after the spawning.
Many eels are trapped
in landlocked waters
and remain there,
never spawning. As all
eels, - especially the
elvers, are well-known
overland travel lets
under fitting condi-
tions, ‘'Hamer’s” tanks
were probably popu-
lated by these explorers.
“Harvib” : Danger notices (B. 17/4/’24) ?
When gas was being belched from the Roma (Q )
oil well, the iron fence surrounding the bore was
placarded with: “If you want to go to Hell, strike a
match here.”
.** * *
“F.A.’s” tragedy of kindness:—
I knew an old cove down near Oxley (N.S.W.) who
used cajolery in horse-breaking. He generally started
the pampering a few days after foaling, and carried
on until the youngster could nearly read and write.
At about six months he would have it following hitn
about like a dog*; three months later it would answer
to its name, and by the time it was a yearling it
had been taught to lie down and had been rigged
up m all the old harness about the place. You
can imagine the degree of precocity of the prad at
two years. It was with one such that I saw old
Joe going off down to the swamp. He had on it a
saddle that only a paralytic could fall out of, and
was leading the colt, although the latter was rubbing
its nose against the small of his back as he went.
From experience I knew what Joe was up to. He
always mounted the young ’uns in the swamp.
They don t hinclirie ter root so much when they're
up to their ’ocks in water an’ mud,” he would say.
I strolled down a few minutes later, and arrived just
as Joe was hauling himself out of the water on to
the prad’s upper surface. The thing stood still
throughout the labored effort, excepting that it turned
and playfully nipped the old cove on the seat of
the pants. “What d’yer think uv ’im?” Joe sang
EVERYTHING COMES TO HIM WHO
WAITS.
BELATED DPORTSMAN: “Am I on time for the
Sydney train?”
STATIONMASTOR: “You’re a hit early yet.”
B. S. ( relieved ): “That's good—when does
she go?”
STATIONNASTER: “Six-fifteen to-morrer
mornin'!”
out to me as he settled himself into the saddle.
Not bad, ’ I answered. The words had hardly left
rne when the colt shook his head and, leaping clear
of the water, delivered not only one of the best
swivel bucks I’ve ever seen but Joe also. “Well,
™t d’yer think o’ that?’’ remarked Joseph when he
had blown the wet from his whiskers. “It’s took
me over two years ter break ’im in, too. It jest
tells yer—yer never knows when yer’ve got ’em.”
The moral I gathered from this experience was that
yom can overdo the petting. Spare the firmness,
spoil the horse.

PROM THE HEIGHTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When sunset died at Kurrajong,
And homing bird and man
Their labor ceased, their singing ceased,
The crickets’ time began.
Now here, now there, now everywhere,
They piped, that minstrel throng;
It was as though the green earth woke,
And voiced itself in song.
In citrus orchards, fair and wide,
Hung heavily with fruit—
Gold spheres enleaved in glossy green—
All song but theirs was mute.
Among the wattles by the creek,
Where through the day was heard
The bellbird’s crystal, tinkling notes,
No other music stirred.
Now here, now there, now everywhere,
They sang in grove and glade,
And heard by gracious folk were they—
Tall trees their audience made.
Tall turpentine and sassafras
By stream and pool and spring,
They hushed their thousand little leaves
To hear the crickets sing.
All day they’d heard the bellbirds chime,
The magpies warble high ;
Sweet, sweet were these, but sweeter was
Earth’s twilight lullaby.
Tired out by too much sun and star
And seeking night and ease,
Unmoved by wind or wing, they stood,
The green enchanted trees.
A WAY THEY HAVE IN THE NAVY.
PROUD MOTHER: “Note you’re a real sailor, Freddy—just
exactly like your dad.”
FREDDY (in his new sailor-suit) : “Yes, ma — and can I
have a wife in every port, toot?”
Now here, now there, now everywhere,
In garden, grove and glade,
While twilight walked the ancient hills
They sang ’neath leaf and blade.
More sweet to me their music seemed
Than lute or violin—■
They sang the purple sunset out,
The silver starshine in.
Dusk crept, as evermore they sang,
Along the timbered heights,
While, far below in farm and town,
Upsprang the lowland lights.
Gloom filled each hollow, wide and deep,
As dark wine fills a cup ;
And then, with night-defying lamps,
The lowland towns lit up.
There Richmond gleamed, there Windsor
showed,
And there, far-off and wan,
Vague—like the far-thrown light of dawn —
The glow of Sydney shone.
Thus man made ready for the gloom
In city, farm and town;
While, like a raven on its nest,
The black night settled down.
Yet here and there and everywhere,
All through the starlit hours,
The crickets sang their song of rest
To trees and- ferns and flowers.

Do you realise how essential
Rubber Goods are to the
development of Australia?
To many people Rubber is associated mostly with Bicycle and Motor tyres, and a few other
rubber articles in everyday use, but its need in other spheres is little thought of. Travellers
by rail seldom give credit to Rubber for the part it plays in ensuring their safety—all the
various brake systems now being dependent on air hose connections (we supply tens of
thousands to the respective Railway Departments in Australia). Take another branch of
transport—the Electric Tram services—here Rubber again is a necessity, insulated cables,
vulcanite, etc., being vital in the harnessing of electricity. All the cable, telegraph, telephone
and wireless systems make demand on Rubber. The telephone transmitters and receivers
are hard polished rubber. In all the leading mines air hoses, steam hoses, valves, etc., are
servants to efficiency, whilst in many, giant conveyor belt systems are doing silent and
economical work in transporting millions of tons of stone, ore, etc., at a figure no other
system can approach for economy.
All power plants, ashore or afloat, pay tribute to Rubber in some form—packings, inser-
tions, gaskets, etc., ensuring efficiency. In all classes of manufacturing the use of Rubber
is on the increase. Hats are shaped and moulded on it—printers use it in the shape of
Rubber blankets—in fact, thousands of calls are made for Rubber and yet more Rubber. Our
pleasures and recreations pay tribute—for Tennis, Golf, Football, Cricket, and Lacrosse all
rely on it. Waterproofing is dependent on Rubber. In our hospitals rubber surgical gloves,
draining tubing, etc., save lives and minimise pain and disease. Your wringer rollers, your
phonograph records, your preserving jar rings, you hot-water bottles, rubber heels and soles
all tend to make life more pleasant. In fact, Rubber in the form of a baby’s comforter
starts you on the road of life, and thereafter it helps to make the world a more pleasant
globe to reside on. From the foregoing you will realise that the Rubber Industry has a con-
siderable influence on this country’s welfare —and incidentally on yours. Such being the case,
it should be apparent that an Australian Industry of such value to this Country is worthy of
support in every way possible. It is essential to your welfare, and your assistance is
essential to it.
How can you help? Simply by always specifying “Dunlop” when purchasing Rubber goods.
It entails no sacrifice. You buy
DUNLOP RUBBER GOODS
cheaper than the imported, and with the certainty of getting value and maximum service.
Half the Rubber goods used in this Country come overseas—the product of workmen who
are paid with Australian gold. With loyal support a further £1,800,000 can stay in Aus-

•).B. : Down at the pub the other day
a well-primed trio began to show sentimental signs
of brotherly love, and finally decided that they would
make out wills each in favor of the other two, the
combined estates to go to the last survivor. The
publican was engaged to draw up the documents, so,
turning to the first man—an Irishman, of course—he
said, “I suppose you perfectly understand this
business?’ “My oath!” was the prompt reply.
“The first cow that snuffs takes the blanky lot!”

“FY7”: “F.A.” on savage horses (B.
24/4/’24) recalls an experience on Terrick station
(C.Q.) in 1891 when it was owned by “Carbine”
Wallace and K. G. Casey. A valuable Shire stallion
turned out a regular maneater, and his paddock
gates had to be adorned with warning notices. One
day an Irish new-chum, riding a mare, took a short
cut across the brute’s domain. The horse gave
chase, and the mare, throwing her rider, jumped
a fence and got away. The horse stopped at the
fallen man and savaged him horribly, then left him
and followed the mare’s tracks to the fence. The
grass was high, and the wretched man, crawling on
hands and knees, made for the fence. As he neared
it, he looked back and saw the horse, nose to the
blood trail, following him through the blue grass
by scent, like a bloodhound. The mangled new-
chum made the fence just in time and was a
patched-up wreck for the remainder of his days.

“Billy Brolga”: Is “Morob” (B. 27/3/’24)
certain about Mrs. Hornbill being able to free her-
self at pleasure after being plastered up in the nest
by her mate? Bushmen believe that if anything
happens to Father Hornbill during the incubating
period his widow perishes miserably along with the
family, should she survive long enough to hatch one
out. The plastering up of the old girl in the nest
during incubation is apparently to protect her from
the depredations of nest-robbing animals.
‘Sikiana” (Solomon Is.) : “Morob’s” par.
(B. 28/2/’24) re the superstition that the eating of
earth by a prospective mother will affect the color
of the child s skin caused me to make inquiries.
Cne native woman had tried it but said there was
nothing in it. Another one had not tried it but
reckoned it was quite correct. It was old Rosie,
the boss boy’s wife, who supplied details. “Master,”
she said, “time I stop along Queensland I been
hearem this story. Baby belong me come, he not
black all same Mother boy—he all same half-caste.
Me tellem husband I been lcaikai ground. Three
fella baby he born along me—-he all same half-
caste. I think this story he true.” “Did you like
living along Queensland, Rosie?” I asked casually
as 1 turned to ride away. “Oh yes, master,” she
lcplied; “that fella master along Bundaberg he
likem me too much.”
HOPE FOR HIM IN AUSTRALIA.
I haven't always worked for my living, you
know.”
"So dad has noticed. But it's only a had
habit he thinks he can cure you of."
“Numbugga” : . “J.F.” is somewhat severe
in his comments (B. 24/4/’24) on some person who
has been writing about brush-turkeys in the Sydney
D.T. Apparently “J.F.’s” experience is limited to
certain districts, and though the statements in the
Telegraph read big, some of them are correct. The
writer did err in stating that all the leaves for 50yds.
round the mound are gathered—had he said “many” in
place of “all” he would have been correct. Then
40ft. is not an abnormally big circumference for a
mound, and although 7ft. high looks somewhat tall to
me, I have a photograph of one over 6ft. As a rule
they are from four to five feet high. The spot selected
is usually the densest part of the scrub —the birds
very rarely mound in the open. Seventy eggs in
one nest reads big, but though I have never seen
the North Coast (N.S.W.), from 20 to 30 eggs are
quite common in mounds in any other part of the
State from Mungundi to Eden. Incidentally, the
Telegraph writer might have added that in building
the mound in a season preceding a drought the
leaves and rubbish gathered will be sometimes
dragged through the water of the nearest creek.
“Tramp” “Callopus’s” pelicans (B.
17/4/’24) must be of an entirely different type to
those about the waters of Central Queensland, I
have watched them diving for fish in dams, par-
ticularly in the Alt. Morgan district, and have often
remarked how fast they are. The pelican will not
exert himself by diving if fish are abundant, but
see him in a dam or lagoon where they are not so
plentiful and you will soon realise his diving capa-
bilities. “Caloola” (B. 20/3/’24) wasn’t far out
when he spoke of a wake like that from a propeller
in referring to Big Bill’s torpedo stunts.
, “Amyl"; “Sarah’s” dad (B. 10/4/’24),
who gets a running nose and a rash all over him
every time he chops spotted-gum, may be surprised to
hear that he is probably suffering from anaphylaxis
on these occasions. Certain substances may so sen-
HE’D TAKE ALL THE RISK.
“Gibbit trink rum, boss. Mine gottem painlonga bingey.”
“Suppose I serve you, Jacky, I get fined.”
Supposem you gibbit boddle and glass, mine tinkit mine serve mine plurry self.”
sitise the human body that on subsequent doses of
them the individual suffers with a chain of symptoms
to which medical science has given the name ana-
phylaxis. These symptoms vary in different people
and may be either a violent streaming from the eyes
and nose, hay fever, “nettle rash” or asthma. The
list of offending substances is as long as your arm,
and includes hen feathers, all kinds of foodstuffs,
animal hairs and the pollens of various flowers and
grasses. For instance, it has been found that a
patient has been completely cured of asthma by
simply taking his feather pillow away from him,
the reason being that he had an anaphylactic hyper-
sensitiveness to hen feathers. All “Sarah’s” paternal
relative can do about it is to carry on as he does
and leave spotted-gum severely alone.

“Ex-Dig.”: Old Bill Carson, in a par. a
while back, mentioned Jim McNully as among the
world’s best axemen. That same James in a com-
petition in Westralia has proved Carson’s words.
He pegged an ordinary piece of fishing-line along
a sleeper and, swinging the broad axe over his
shoulder at each stroke, cut along from end to end.
The line was removed intact and revealed a clean
straight cut which had not been visible until the
string was shifted. Some could beat Jim in a log
chop, but none could wield a blade more skilfully.
* * * *
“Monte”: In the series of accidents that
happened to an Adelong man, as recorded by “Gill
Guy” (B. 3/4/’24), the last mishap on the list
appears to be a little over the odds. It is stated
that a bit of a hoist by the tail was usually suffi-
cient assistance to raise the disabled cow, but
it last the appendage broke off and the man landed
in a heap with the cow’s tail in his hand. I want
the opinion of the cattle section of the Council as
to the probability of a man pulling a cow’s rear
ornament off in the manner stated, even if he pulled
his darnedest. Personally, I think there are not
many men on this planet who could perform such
a feat.
“Sucre”: “Adamascus” supports “Jimmy
Possum” (B. 17 /4/’ 2 4) in his contention that
koalas don’t drink water. Betcherlife they do! I
scalped 30 years ago for bread and butter, and
know that native-bears come down to the nearest
water after sunset and fill up to Plimsoll for the
next day. “Adamascus’s” Rockhampton (Q.) ex-
ample is easily explained—in that delectable town
anyone can subsist on his own sweat. I was born
there 50 years ago and know.
“Cartot”: Re the origin of the name
“damper.” The same word is used for a similar bread
in California, and in many other parts of the Western
United States, even to Colorado. Since there is a
Mexican-Spanish word closely resembling it which is
applied nowadays to bread that is baked in an open
fireplace, the probability is that the term was brought
here in the days of the gold-rushes by Californian
miners who are known to have imported a number
of other words now in frequent use.
* * * #
“Lobjc”: When our family was up on
Garrawilla station, near Gunnedah (N.S.W.), in my
youngsterhood, I used to bring grist to my money-
box by poddying stray lambs. An old cow was
given me as my own private property; I milked
her for the lambs, in whose welfare she always
took a benevolent interest. One day Strawberry
was smitten by a sickness of the udder, and the
family decreed that until she recovered she must
be milked no more; so they gave me another cow
in her place. No. 2 was a bad-tempered, ill-condi-
tioned brute, and all my youthful efforts failed to
entice her into the bail. Strawberry, who had' been
hanging round wistfully, must have lost patience at
last, for she nosed open the gate, goi behind her
pig-headed successor, and shoved her in. News of
this marvel spread, and next morning the whole
station turned out to witness it. The performance
was repeated, much to my pride and gratification,
and after that my old cow occupied a position pro-
bably unique in bovine history—official shover of
obstinate heifers. Whenever a young cow was
brought in Strawberry was to the fore. With a
guiding rope round the youngster’s horns and Straw-
berry behind, the newcomer stood no chance, and
was bailed up in record time. The idea was en-
tirely her own, and she thoroughly deserved the
honor and prestige which it gave her.
* * * *
“Numbugga”: “Keystring” (B. 24/4/’24)
is correct in placing the brown hawk (Ileiracidea
orientalis) before the laughing-jackass as a snake-
k^ 11 i Gr - Much of good old John’s snake-destroying
ability is legendary, but the brown hawk is a cham-
pion and is closely followed by the eaglehawk (Audax
aquila). The wriggler has no chance whatever in
his contests with the brown hawk, who cuffs him
with the wings, and brings talons and beak in
where necessary. Seizing the partly-stunned reptile
the bird flies up from 50 to 200 feet and drops him
—and whatever life might have been left in him
is promptly shattered by the bump at the finish.
Larry Longun”: I can’t see how Binghi
could possibly remove his bark canoe from a trunk
in the manner described by “Riverina” (B. 10/4/’24),
who that he let it “partly dry on the
tree.” I was a timbergetter for years, and I
ALL IN THE AIR.
“ Blimey, Bill, this ’ere wireless is like the
rows me and the missus ’as.”
“’Ow’s that, Joe?”
“Words over nothin’, Bill.”
always found it next to impossible to remove a sheet
of bark from any of our gums without cracking or
bursting it once the sap had dried. If left till it
commences to separate from the tree of itself (which
would be in about 12 months), the bark would, as
a rule, be too badly sun-cracked and pierced by
wood-grubs to be of any use for canoe-building.
“B.O.B.”: Two good examples of intelli-
gent, normal full-blooded blacks are Trooper George
Osborne, of Urbenville, and J. P. Boney, of Uralla
(N.S.W.). The first-named was taken as a boy and
educated by Dr. Osborne,. who taught him all he
would have taught a son. The young black soon
more than held his own at books and sports, par-
ticularly boxing and rifle shooting; but there is
not yet any place in the social scheme for clever
blackfellows, so Osborne joined the mounted police
as a tracker. “Professor” Boney is a New England
black, too, and has a name as an athlete which one
of his sons is worthily upholding. Both these abos.
are tall, well-built men, with the peculiar eyes which
set their class apart from other colored men. This
gives them the hawk-like vision which the red man
of America also has, in spite of civilisation’s effects.
“B.” : What flavor would a fish diet give
pork? At liaipara (M.L.) a train which included
a truck loaded with pigs was blocked by flood water.
As the hours passed, the hogs, for whom no provision
in the way of a menu had been made, began to
raise Jehoshaphat. Driven frantic by their lamenta-
tions and expostulations, one of the train crew be-
thought him of a consignment of flounders in the
van. As there was no knowing when the train
would get a move on, the fish were dumped to the
pigs, and, amidst squeals of delight, were scoffed to
the last scale.
* * * *
“Gouger”: I had a mate in the good days
who could see as well by night as by day. On
the darkest of nights his eyes would occasionally
glow as if covered by a film of phosphorus. Some
hereditary relic, I suppose, of the ages when his
ancestors used to forage under cover of the darkness.
He was invaluable when travelling over rough bush
country by night. He once told me his brother
also had the same gift—or curse, as he called it. In
Palestine I always felt quite secure when on night
outpost duty with him. No prowling Turkish patrol
could get within 300 yards of us. He fell within
sight of the walls of Jerusalem, worse luck! He
was very tender about his feline sight, taking it as
a sort of slur, and I doubt if any man in the regi-
ment but myself knew about it.
* » * *
Some elongated jumpers :
“Nitric”: “J.G.” is wrong when he says (B.
17/4/’24j ? that a snake never springs forward, though
I admit the backward action is the favorite. I
once saw a tiger-snake spring a good 4ft. at a
tom-cat and register below the neck. A fifth of
a second later there was a crack and Tom had
broken the wriggler’s neck. They died within five
minutes of each other.
“Tarago”: I believed with “J.G.” that the safest
position was in front of a snake —-until I learned
different. Seeing a 4ft. copperhead stretched across
our path, a mate undertook to keep it from getting
away while I found a stick. As the snake started to
move off he got in. front of it, and, taking off his
hat, commenced to “shoo” it as he would a barn-
door fowl; but the elongated gentleman politely
but firmly refused to be turned back. First be tried
to get around one side, and finding himself blocked
there he tried the other side, with the same result;
then he stopped and appeared to think the matter
out. Suddenly rearing about three-parts of his body
in the air he sprang, or lunged forward like a
flash a distance of fully 6ft. My mate yelled and
jumped, spreading his legs as he went up. He
reckoned afterwards that he never jumped so high
in his life in a “stander” —yet the snake’s head
just missed the lower part of his body. “J.G.’s”
man with a short stick would stand no chance in a
ease like that. I have killed snakes from all angles
and have found that the most difficult and dangerous
positions are (1) behind, (2) in front; the reasons
being that from those positions a wriggler is nearly
as easy to hit as a politician’s policy, and if you
miss once any self-respecting snake will make a
fight of it.
CONTENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a tall, clean-shaven man,
And sickled o’er with pallid cast;
Approached he the allotted span,
And he had settled down at last.
He told me this the time to pass,
The while he polished up the brass.
“I do not scoff at art,” he said ;
“Art’s very well, sir, in its way.”
He paused a while to scratch his head —
Art- brought me here,” I heard him say.
“I was a member once,” quoth he,
‘Of Dunk’s Dramatic Company.
“I did old men in Shakspeare’s plays,
And sometimes I was quite the rage;
But it was hard, sir, in those days
To make a living on the stage.
One year when, stranded, broke, in Yam,
I took this job—and here 1 am.
“I don’t hate art, nor curse at it;
I even praise it in a way ;
For when all’s done, sir, I admit
Art made me what I am to-day.”
He’s billiard-marker, truth to tell,
And rouseabout at Mack’s hotel.

Iwiliglit House at Mosman has adopted
an attractive country sister. It is built on
the roomy bungalow plan, and stands amid
tail pines and taller gums at Beecroft. Like
the Mosman house, it is for the accommoda-
tion of gentlewomen overtaken by lean years,
and already there is a full complement of
nominees for its 15 bedrooms. One day last
week the Governor-General’s lady, with Cap-
tain Forster, motored up to declare the pretty
place open. Mrs. Arthur Allen, an enthusi-
astic fwilighter, extended the glad hand to
her on behalf of purring groups of com-
mittee workers, and somebody thrust a gor-
geous armful of pink carnations on the vice-
reine, who, putting up no defence, clutched
them against sapphire-blue frocking. Each
room in the new building has been furnished
by a friend ; and the dear old ladies of the
town house have at their own expense made
a charming nest of the drawing-room at Bee-
croft. Among the interested guests the other
atternoon were secretary Innes Noad and
Miss lounger, matron at Mosman. That
~y.®®. Jamieson who ran St. Bernard’s in
\Y llliam-street for so many years is matron.
The De Chair lady, flashing Robin Hood
greens and deep browns, opened the Women
1 abaters show on Monday afternoon with
a felicitous little speech that would have
made the Feminists weep for joy. The sight
v* e crow dea walls and the surging halls
of the Education Gallery plainly amazed the
vice-reine, who, clutching an armful of
satiny wallflowers thrust upon her by Pre-
sident Ethel Stephens, proceeded to do the
show conscientiously. There are a few ex-
quisite works in a collection mostly mediocre
the committee obviously suffers from kind-
ness of heart. Of course, such giants of
the society as Mrs. Parsons, Dora Wilson,
Hetty Dymock and Ethel Stephens stand
out. The black-and-wliites of Theodora St
John caught many an eye, and sculptor Theo
Cowan s Edith Cavell drew compellingly.
She has worked out in her bronze the
austere, unflinching spirit—the hands hold
the intensity of a Duse’s.
Mrs. Walter Swinson stage-managed the
Kouara fair that carried trainloads of eager
girls and boys, not to speak of grown-ups, to
iurramurra on Saturday. The lawns around
block of flats were a seething mass
ot humans long before the Governor uttered
the official Go!” from the balcony. With
lum. was his lady, in lemon-colored velour
suitings, above which she flew millinery to
tone, and she seemed just as anxious as any-
body else to have a look at the Coster glit-
tering with pearlies and his donah with a
hat that would have made an ostrich hide
ns head with chagrin—or whatever it is an
ostrich uses for this job. There were a lot
more of these suspicious-looking characters
about the grounds, and that they go camou-
tiaged as professors and judges and bankers
on every other day only seemed to have wetted
their native cupidity as proprietors of vari-
ous shies. There was a bellman, too, who
had hypnotised Irene Vanbrugh till she fol-
lowed him like his shadow the entire after-
noon, and helped his nefarious schemes by
seUing tickets at two shillings apiece. No
doubt he rewarded the unhappy lady by
stealing the paradise plume from her hat—

shamelessly. What with this and that, Punch
and Judy and the Cheer-ohs, and wireless
concerts and dancing on the green, the after-
must mean a great lift to

and the afternoon was a whirl of happiness
from the first slide to the last ice-cream. Lady
lorster, a golden-brown symphony in maro-
cain and sables, waved the official wand
while son-in-law Captain Pitt Rivers stood
by. Tiny Alison Adams, as fragrant as a
garden pink, greeted her Ex. with an old-
tashioned posy of violets and pansies.
The theatrical tea-party for the kinder-
gartens gathered together in Muriel Starr’s
name at the Ambassadors on Monday should
drop a pretty penny in the money-box.
Stage favorites, _ old and new, hostessed
groups of tea-drinkers, and of these was
Sweet Nell herself, as radiant as the beauti-
ful floral decorations on her table. Muriel
Starr brought Frank Garden-of-Allah
Harvey; and Pirie Bush was the squire of
Vi en i e anbrugh’s table. Just-to-be-married
Gladys Moncrieff brought her fiance; and
good-natured Hector St. Clair turned on a
stream of merry chat in the interludes of
dancing. Nell Stewart also put in a bit of
overtime collecting from the surrounding
tables, and Muriel Starr displayed a fine
aptitude for auctioneering.
Members of the Industrial Blind Institute
can now listen-in to a wireless concert any
evening they feel inclined. The radio set
which the Neutral Bay Radio Club built and
installed for them will be placed in the
library among the 11,000 books that cheer
the days of the dark men. On Monday night
the Institute listened to its first wireless con-
cert. But that was held in the big hall;
and even then many of the visitors had to
sit in the passage outside the long room.
The Apollos raised their voice in song
week at the Conservatorium, with Alfred
Hill s baton to cheer them. The concert was
a tremendous _ success, serving to flash a
stream of brilliant soprano notes before the
audience. The possessor of the remarkable
voice is Ethel Osborn, and her triumph was
so instantaneous that Paling’s concert-man-
ager Jack Brownlow has arranged a Town
Hall recital for her on May 29. Another
feature of the concert was the artistic work
of basso Francis Halls.

Dr. Dan Kelly welcomed his wife home

(Adelaide) made a dash for Sydney last

corn-gold entanglements. They were seen
lunching together last week at the Ambassa-

justice to that battle of the beards!
The original of this May Moore photo is
May Itivett, one of the brilliant chicks of a
scholastic and clerical dad, of Gordon. The
simple-looking little girl camouflages a high-
voltage set of brains that plucked her a tripos
in psychology at Cambridge, after winning
her bursaries
that took their
owner through
Sydney Uni.
and after-
wards floated
her oif to
Newnham on
a travelling
scholar-
sliip, and still
later landed,
her as lec-
turer in psy-
chology at the
London Uni.
The other
afternoon, at
the Peace
Conference of
the National
Council of
Women, the
fledgling
(whose Uni.
job is lecturer in the department of tutorial
classes) jumped into the breach left by Pro-
fessor Lovell’s absence, and spoke for half
an hour without notes and without prepara-
tion. She is the founder of the Children’s
Library in Devonshire-street, Surry Hills.
On three afternoons and two evenings a w r eek
May Rivett and her sister hand out bits of
Dreamland in the form of books, or on the
magic stream of storytelling carry the kid-
dies of the arid streets into the country of
beauty and adventure. The two girls have
got together a library of 400 kiddies’ books,
and have installed them in a room at the
Friends’ Meeting House, made picturesque
by stained floors and cushions and gay
posters.
Mrs. Baynes-Jardine is back visiting her
family after seven years in the Cold Coun-
try. She was a Merivale, and met her bit
of England with the hyphenated name wßen
he was soldiering in Cairo. Another returnee
to the sunshine is Mrs. Wilkinson, who was
Marcia Osborne. She brings an attractive
dancing daughter, Joan, with her.
Back for a visit to her home-town, Mrs.
James Francis Dwyer, who used to be the
wife of the novelist and short-story writer
so popular with American readers. Mrs.
Dwyer, who divorced her husband four years
ago, has by sheer grit and hard work built up
a candy business of her own in America. In-
cidentally, the 50 years she claims sit on
her like smiling 40. She brings with her
photographs of a daughter—a serene young
beauty of 20.
A grand-daughter of that Dean Hole, of
Rochester, who wrote the charming books
about his roses and his garden, died at
Somerton, near Tamworth, the other day.
She was the widow of the late Richard
Brown, of Mendebrie station —she went there
as a bride 48 years ago. Among her three
children the only daughter is Mrs. Stewart
Beit, of Mosman.
A lady who at 94 nurses an ambition, and
has the energy to see about fulfilling it, is
Mrs. Sarah Musgrave, of Auburn, who hopes
to get the memories of a crowded life into a
book. She was the first white woman born
in the vicinity of what is now Young, the
event occurring on the station of her uncle,
the James White who made considerable his-
tory thereabouts. With a clear remembrance
of bushrangers, blacks, gold-rushes, flood, fire
and all the other ingredients of pioneering,
Mrs. Musgrave has any amount of material
tor what, at her age, is an unprecedented
undertaking.
The Hawkesbury honored its oldest inhabi-
tant the other day—Mrs. Sarah Brown, who
was 94 on April 29. In two ways she was
connected with pioneers: her father, William
Hopkins, was the first miller In Windsor,
and her husband was the meenister of the
first Presbyterian kirk erected in Australia
—it was built at Ebenezer in 1810. The
old lady still attends it.
N. S. Wales has opened the door of its
Law Courts to Marie B. Byles, 8.A., LL.B.,
who has qualified to practise as a solicitor.
She is not quite the first Sydney woman to
intrude in the law; Miss A. Evans, 8.A.,
IjL.-8., three years ago was admitted as a
barrister, although she has never taken a
brief. Miss Byles proposes to take all the
six-and-eightpences that offer.
Isabel Manton, the energetic secretary of
the Ini Catholic Women’s Society, has
announced a cabaret in the Casino at Bondi
for June 28. Behind the entertainment is a
Pl°t to gather funds for the Women’s College
that the Catholic girl-students are anxious
to have built within the Uni. A galaxy of
singing stars has promised to shoot melody
between dances.
May 23, the eve of Empire Day, has been
chosen by the Army and Navy for their
United Services Ball. A double brace of
vice-regals will turn the dais in the Town
Hall into a social incubator; and to them
Naval-Commander Craufurd’s lady will pre-
sent the chickens as they are hatched. The
Australian Flying Corps has threatened to
metamorphose the hall with an eye-arresting
scheme of decoration. Soldiering and sailor-
mg males are to be allowed to come in full
dress, mess dress and undress blue —which
last sounds like a suit of woad and very
shivery for this time of year ! Those good
workers Josephine Marks and Mrs. J. C.
Leete are arranging a programme of gallery
attractions.
One result of the death of A. D. Hall,
familiarly known as “Chops,” the beloved
sports master of Shore Grammar, was the
postponing of the dance which was to have
been held at the Wentworth last week. The
new date is in June. For 33 years out of
the school’s 35, Mr. Hall had been associated
with it.
Uni. Sports Union annual dance is timed
ior 8.30 to-morrow (Friday) night.
Paddington Town Hall will be the scene
of St. Ignatius’ Old Boys’ Ball on June 3;
and secretary George McEllione drops a
memo, to tell any young-man-in-a-hurry that
he can dash into Nicholson’s and buy tickets
tor himself and the future sharer of his Rolls
Royee, and still Be a winner in the day’s rush
for the elusive millions.
The Junior Red Crossers are preparing a
super-exhibition for May 19 and 20 at the
.own Hall, A series of tableaux represent-
ing the flowers, industries and countries of
the Empire will be the stage attraction, while
the hall will be stocked with clever work of
baby hands destined for soldiers’ orphans,
ihe State Governor and his smiling lady
will attend on the first day, and Lord and
Lady Forster on the second.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Blue tulle draperies and golden chrysanthemums
expressed the colors of the Women Graduates’ Assoc,
at the Gresham for that body’s annual dinner. Mere
man is not admitted to these functions, but toasts
were honored in good style, President E. M. Fisher
proposing George Rex, Alan Dakin’s spouse “The
New Grads” and Dora Lockington “The Guests.”
Dr. Eleanor Greenham and the head of the College
Miss Hunt, were in the gathering.
The Sefton Joneses, fresh from Cochin China and
Java, are at Kingsley. Their daughter is married tc
the Governor of Ceylon, Brigadier-General Manning, and
they paid the youngsters a visit before moving further
east. The lady is a Fellow of the Royal Historical
Society, and has written books on the literature of
the twelfth century, while Sefton Jones is best
known in archeology and anthropology. They are
particularly interested in some of Henry Tryon’s
rock-drawing discoveries on the Downs. From here
they go to Sydney, thence to Maoriland and Cali-
fornia.
~ nnie Greene, of Moreton Bay High School, is
being congratulated on having two portraits accepted
by the Salon des Beaux Arts, Paris.
The Reaper has been busy in Brisbane; among
those gathered were William Hortsmann, auditor and
accountant, who had practised in the E„ S. & A.
Buildings for about 30 years and directed the
Electric Construction Co. and the Shipping Regis-
ter; Mrs. A. E. Paterson, president of the Women’s
National Defence Assoc.; and Mrs. Alexander Stewart,
one of the pioneers.
For the building fund of Lourdes Hill Convent,
the H. J. Windsor, Cullen and Finnigan dames
fixed up a jazz evening at the Bellevue, with card-
tables and chrysanthemums in the lounge. The
crowd included Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, the Barrvs,
O Maras, Caniffes, Norah Halford, Nancy McCowan,
Sheila Mcßryde and Dr. Ellis Murphy.
The Arts and Crafts had a meeting on the same
• night, when versatile art-worker Miss Evans received
many felicitations for her pottery, leather-work and
jewellery. Mrs. F. Pierson was made president.
Warwick has gone gay with picnic races, to which
a good many Brisbane people ran up. Mrs. Charlie
White on the first day wore black with oriental
jumper and black hat; Mrs. J. H. S. Barnes black
’broidered in Egyptian work; and Miss Lorna Brookes
brown Paisley. At the Race Ball Mrs. Barnes
(whose husband presides over the club) was in
royal blue and silver brocade, Miss Maeansh in
apricot crepe de Chine, and Mrs. Stanthorpe White
in silver grey brocade with a silver rose. Croquet
teas and a Hospital Ball also happened during the
week; and now Warwick is trying to get its breath
again.
The Women’s College standing committee in Bris-
bane is stirring up an appeal for £3OOO for a new
college to enable students from the country to
study in the city, with hostels to put them up. The
idea is to build on the site of the proposed new
’Varsity. Col. Thynne’s lady has been made president
of the movement.
The Country Women’s Assoc. (Metropolitan Branch)
met on the same day. These busy people are bring-
ing down batches of kiddies from Outback for sea-
side holidays; the Travellers’ Aid party is doing its
bit, and there is also a rest home in the city for
weary mothers. Mrs. Petersen was the guardian
angel of the meeting.
At Ascot there was a holiday crowd for the May
races, but the women semed to distrust the weather
and black or dark froeking was the order, thougli
Nancy Stewart’s almond green and white lit up the
landscape.

The Head of the River was the fixture of
the w r eek-end. On Saturday morning the
road to Geelong suggested Young and Jack-
son’s corner at its busiest; and squeezed
in the motor procession just like aiiy old
buzz-cart was the State Governor’s limou-
sine, with the colors of all the final
crews fluttering from it. (The Stradbrokes
have sons at all three schools.) Melbourne
flapperdom poured itself on to the banks of
the Barwon to see Geelong Grammar sprint
past the winning spot just one foot in front
of the dark blues, with Scotch a poor third.
The young things then dashed back to town
in time to leap into their glad-rags for a
riotous night in an overflowing house at
“The Cabaret Girl.” The Melbourne Gram-
mar crew, who had been previously fed at
Menzies’ by the Old Boys’ president, Dr.
Alan Mackay, stepped into the theatre late
and smiled self-consciously as the house
loudly cheered their arrival. The tangle of
colored streamers at the end of the first act
threatened to send the performers somer-
saulting into the orchestra; but the breath-
less moment of the evening came with the
screening of a movie of the day’s race.
All best-bibbed and -tuckered, Toorak
seemed to have emptied itself into His
Majesty’s on Thursday night for the first
showing of “La Sonnambula,” with Toti Dal
Monte as the songful sleep-walker. Toti
smiled bewitcliingly in the betrothal scene
under her peasant’s Sunday cap of heavy
white lace, back-verandahed by a fan-shaped
frill, and she swished a skirt of blue-flowered
silk topped by a muslin chemisette and
apron. Her nighty for the sleep-walking-
act was silken and becoming, and her final
frock was of shot pink taffeta above a black-
flowered velvet hem, while a fringed hanky,
carelessly knotted about her neck, dripped
on to a muslin pinny, banded with pink
and white ribbon. Governor Stradbroke
was in the front-circle seats with daughter
Helena and Hester Phillimore. His Count-
ess, who seldom misses a performance, had
scratched for the event owing to a chill. Primin-
ister Bruce’s -wife and Mrs. Pitt Rivers were
in a gilded pen with Mrs. Fred Payne and
her sister, Mrs. Ernest Wilshire. John Mon-
ash had his usual first-night seat. Fred
Knight brought daughter Ida, who is collect-
ing a trousseau for matrimony and Colombo.
Mrs. Albert Miller was sighted in the circle,
likewise Mrs. George Chirnside, ravishing in
pink brocade.
Ex-Justice Hartley Williams’s dashing
younger daughter, Muriel, who left her
native land soon after breaking her matri-
monial links with the late Oswald Watt,
asked an English Divorce Court Judge the
other day to cut her second matrimonial
bonds and release her from General Sir
Sidney Lawson, whom she married in the
first year of the war. The naughty General
was later on cited as co-re. in another un-
defended divorce case. He is said to be
nearly related to Muriel’s stepmother, the
present Lady Williams.
The Mayoral Bruntons had their first
quarterly spree in the old Council Chamber
on Friday night—a dinner preluded by a
how-d’ye-do in the lady’s parlor. Mrs.
Brunton hostessed attractively in lilac and
silver brocade. All the city fathers attended
with their wives and daughters. The ban-
quet was spread at long tables bedded down
the centre with red and yellow chrysanthe-
mums artistically garlanded with autumn
leaves, and golden orchids clambered like
giant spiders over the fern-frond fringing the
table-lamps. After the final course the host-
ess led her company back to the parlor,
where they were further refreshed with
music by Dorothy Humphries, Ivy Wilmot,
Jo Forster, Percy Blundell and Billy Bur-
rell. Speeches had been censored, but after
the King had been toasted Mayor Brunton
welcomed Town Clerk McCall back after his
long illness and trip oversea, and Alderman
Jeffries called for three cheers for Alderman
Burton, whose 79th birthday it was.
Grand-opera attractions failed to thin the
crowd which rushed to Oscar Asche in “The
Skin Game.” The sartorial sensation of the
evening was furnished by a boxed lady, who
suggested a Red Indian with a halo of up-
standing white cockiolly feathers at the back
of her head. Throughout the evening she
languidly flirted a huge white feather fan,
while a blue balloon bobbed disconsolately
from her left hand. On the stage the femi-
nine members of the co. in the first act were
all beautifully frocked to time and occasion
in woollies of varied autumn tints. As the
heroine, Doris Champion topped tartan
skirts with a little brown jacket and
a velvet toque in brown and rose. Mary
MacGregor as a flapper looked like a chirp-
ing canary in a yellow crochet jumper over
a skirt of brown cloth hooped with many
colors. In the auction-room scene all the
women sported fur-trimmed upholsterings.
Doris Champion’s grey silk-embroidered
cloth had side panels weighted with a darker
pelt, and the same fur edged the collar
under a little henna lid with an upturned
front. The flapper flapped about in fur-
liemmed apple-green, and dimpled under a
drawn silk hat of the same color, with an
end of fringe hanging over the left ear.
Mildred Cottell, as the flapper’s mother,
Avas enfolded in periwinkle-colored cloth
with fur weighting the tunic hem, and had
an upturned blue hat-brim. In the boudoir
scene Doris was a vision in a fluffy mauve
neglige, with lace loosely cobwebbing her
white arms and shoulders. Then a yellow
blister silk rigout, reminiscent of spilt mus-
tard, prefaced white satin and georgette, cur-
tainings with diamente all a-glitter on the
under skirt, a black crepe shoulder-wrap
warming the upper section of the ravishing
confection.
The medical George Hodgsons’ ewe lamb
Edith was matrimonially shackled to Aidan
Mooney at the Grammar Chapel by Padre
Arnold the other evening. The bride’s grace-
ful slimness was swathed in snowy velvet
brocaded with pearls cascading down the port
side, while the bridal tulle flowed from gold
leaves and orange flowers. The bridegroom’s
sister Alma ’maided in silky brocade colored
like a ripe peach, and had pink flowers
weighting a mist of pink tulle on her head.
Arthur Man ton was in charge of the ’groom.
Healths were drunk at No. 9 Darling-street,
where Mrs. Hodgson (she was a Ham)
hostessed in crepe bronzed like an autumn
leaf ; while the bridegroom’s mother, Mrs. H.
O. Allan, cheered an inky frock with a dash
of vivid red on the side panel. There was
a big collection of Hams around the tables,
with a smaller number of Mooneys ; also the
Richard Lintons, Mrs. Aruott (Sydney),
and so on.
Mrs. Kent Hughes, here pictured by Lafay-
ette, has now added to her list of charitable
activities the hon. secretaryship of the Mel-
bourne Hospital’s newly-formed League of
Social Ser-
v i c e. The
energetic
matron, who
once wore the
cap and apron
of a hospital
sister, has
never allowed
her interest in
the sick poor
to ease down;
and having
babies of her
own she natu-
rally shares
her many-
sided medical
husband’s in-
terest in baby
clinics, kinder-
gartens, child-
dren’s play-
grounds in
fact, every-
thing that makes for the health and happi-
ness of the youngsters of the city.
A cheque for £lOOO will flutter into the
District Nursing Association’s money-box
as a result of the charity matinee at the
Palace which drew the swishest crowd on
record. Everyone had been in generous
mood; Hugh Ward lent the theatre and staff,
someone unnamed sent along £lOO, another
paid for the orchestra, several more contri-
buted £2O cheques, and still others forwarded
sweets and flowers. The guinea and half-
guinea seats were all snapped up early in
the week, and the gallery overflowed at ss.
and 3s. a head. The great draw, ot course,
was the G.-G.’s daughter in a naughty little
French comedy with Seymour Hicks, who
looked as if he was thoroughly enjoying
himself. After her final bow the lady was
convoyed to a pen by press sec. Wicking.
The vice-regal Stradbrokes, who made their
entry under Hugh Ward’s wing, were boxed
in one of the lower enclosures. Flower and
sweet kiosks lent the theatre entrance a
giddy, colorful air. Here the Harry Emmer-
ton and Fred Payne matrons were in com-
mand, with the Groom and George Chirn-
side matrons and several more of the thickly
gilded. Of course all the young things
rushed the job of vending lollies and posies,
which resulted in there being ever too many
of the poor dears. Lady Helena Rous and
Hester Phillimore played the part of brigands
until the curtain went up.
As the &ride of the playlet Mrs. Pitt
Rivers draped her graceful length in filmy
white overset by a close-fitting length of the
material. This fell from the shoulder, and,
after flouncing the front width under a head-
ing of silver leaves, ended up as a panel-
train. More leaves anchored the fabric to
the shoulders, and were posied on one hip.
She took her final curtain behind a white
trophy moored with green ribbons which had
come from the vice-regal enclosure. A laurel
wreath handed up to Seymour Hicks was
slipped over to the lady by the actor, and as
promptly slipped back again with reciprocal
modesty. May Beatty added about £45 to
the takings by her genius as an auctioneer.
Earl Stradbroke secured a box of chocs, for
£B, and Mrs. Robert Hunter and Mrs. Wal-
lace Mitchell each paid £lO for their little
lots, and then placed them back on the
auction block.
Meet Charlotte Grivell, the Adelaide lass
who has been awarded the Elder Scholarship
for three years at the Royal College of Music,
London, where she will continue to develop
a contralto
which already
combines
great range
with quality.
Dame Clara
Butt, on her
last visit, made
little Gliar-
lotte’s eyes
sparkle by de-
claring that it
was the near-
est approach
to her own
voice that she
had heard.
The young
songbird, who,
with sister
Ivy (a con-
tralto, too)
and brother
Sabi e, is a
familiar figure
.on the concert platform, received most of
her training from her brother, hut has lat-
terly been under H. Winslow Hall. She
gives a recital in the Adelaide Town Hall
on June 10, and leaves for London early
in July.
A globe-trottah of considerable tonnage
and intelligence who steams away on the
next boat for London is much struck by our
strike news. He remarks that, as far as he
can gathah, bai Jove, the main duty of Pre-
miah-johnnies in this deah old country is to
“intervene in strikes,” and as long as they
continue to do that sort of thing they will
have lots of silly strikes to intervene in,
what! Trades-union leader-johnnies are
only human; also they belong to that sec-
tion of our jolly old humanity that makes
a fuss of its self-importance. So the more
you minister to its self-importance the more
strike conferences and so forth the news-
papers will get to play with, doncherknow.
Mayor Brunton stepped into the Children’s
Hospital the other afternoon to open the
canteen which, thanks to the combined efforts
of auxiliary workers and the Trades Hall,
has been added to the institution. Here
patients and their visiting friends will be
able to get soup or tea, with the usual accom-
paniments, for the humble traybit, and
mothers will be able to heat up the babies’
bottles at a special apparatus in the kitchen,
where there are also a steriliser and a special
hot-water service. The canteen will be open
from Monday till Friday between 9.30 a.m.
and 4.30 p.m., with auxiliary workers to
shoulder the job of amateur waitresses. The
Mayor said all the nice things expected of
him, Mrs. Harry Emmerton handed him
some cordial thanks, and Miss Guthrie (the
hospital’s lion, sec.), President A. T. Danks,
of the Melbourne Hospital, and Mr. Foster
all commended the good work begun that day.
In the crowd were sighted the Chauvel,
Winter Irving, Kent Hughes and Archie
Currie matrons, and Miss Poolman.
Henry Russell clearly couldn’t long con-
tinue to be “artistic director” of the grand
opera after all the productions had been
arranged and most of them actually staged.
The bright little man would have lagged
superfluous had he not got away by the
Ormonde last week. His last words were
about two voices that had particularly inter-
ested him in Australia. One was that of
Muriel Benton, whom he took away with
him for five years’ study: the other was an
eleventh-hour discovery—Eileen Starr’s. She
had been a member of the opera co. all the
time, but it was only a week before his de-
parture that he detected brilliance. Russell
declared that culture across the water would
improve this voice tremendously. But the
girl’s singing was not her only strength.
For “all-round possibilities” she surpassed
any young thing he had heard in Australia.
Priminister Bruce’s wife floated into the
Malvern Town Hall the other morning to
open the half-yearly sale for the Gentle-
women’s Aid Society, and declared that of
all philanthropic efforts this was the one
which lay closest to her heart. She was
welcomed by the Llewellyn and Seton Wil-
liams matrons, the president (Mrs. Tre-
mearne) and the hon. sec. (Miss Flower).
Later in the day a bridge party, engineered
by Mrs. Llewellyn, brought in a plump
cheque towards a fund to provide members
who have been on the sick-list with a change
of air. The only fault to be found with this
society is its excessive modesty, wherefore
the public doesn’t know what a really fine
work it is doing. Mrs. Henry Rosenthal
has just been invited on to tbe committee,
and she is likely to enlist the sympathies
of a group of fresh people. The Grice,
Staugliton, Umphelby, A. Austin, Outhwaite
and Yencken matrons were noted among the
keen buyers at the sale.
Prince’s Dance Club, which has sprung
to life again, with the jazz-loving veteran
Edmund Jowett as president, had its first
whirl of the season in Old Admiralty House
dance-rooms _ on Friday night, after Paul
Bibron’s frivol had wound up at 11.30.
Presumably there is something doggish ill
starting a jam when less gilded folk are
finishing theirs, A good many of tile night
clubites were at Geelong, but quite enough
turned up to keep the ball roiling until 1.30
a.m., doubtless to the great interest of the
dwellers in the near-by flats mansions. Among
the trotters were the Frank Schlesinger pair,
a couple of Winter Irving damsels, Joari
Chirnside, the Everard Browne girls, Rod,
Noel and Geoff Heath, Dick Casey and gent,-
liplp Iveppell Palmer.
Lady Stradbroke’s appeal for a “straight-
out” subscription _of £15,000 to the District
Nursing Association must have felt like a
cold douche to those who contemplate charity-
matinee performances of one sort and an-
other. The other Governor’s daughter was
about to star beside Seymour Hicks and
other professional mummers at a matinee,
so the Countess’s letter, explaining that
straight-out cash would save a lot of time
aud trouble, had a significant appearance.
She didn’t murmur a word about waste of
money in exes, which sometimes come to
light on a matinee balance-sheet, but the
stress she laid_ on “unnecessary labor” and
the need for “immediate relief” was almost
a reproof to the charity which covers a mul-
titude of advertisements. Still, one need not
feel that a Cause is under any very deep
obligation to those who supply tile “unneces-
sary labor.” They simply love the toil in
most cases. And in the other cases they
don’t want to be left out.
The Melbourne Hospital Social Service
Auxiliary Guild staged a dance in tile out-
patients’ hall the other evening to swell the
guild funds. The Quick lady, who is pre-
sident, was the main organiser, with the
Robert Hunter and H. I. Cohen matrons
(vice-presidents), Mrs. Matthew Lang and
H. H. Smith, of the House of Landlords,
giving a hand, while Mrs. Springthorpe
looked after the refreshment side. There
was a fine old roll-up, the dressing was
dressy, and the takings exceeded expecta-
tions ; so everyone is content, especially
Gertrude Rennie, the hon. treasurer.
Caps and aprons and Christian names, it
appears, are not the only disturbing factors
in the domestic-servant problem. Factory-
owners are now loudly bewailing a slump in
feminine workers. Chairman Bell, of the
Ballarat woollen mills, who is also a member
of the House of Landlords, says that the
mills cannot muster enough hands to keep
the wdieels revolving at full strength, and
he puts it down to the girls sniffing at fac-
tory work as “unladylike.” It would be in-
teresting to know what the out-of-date term
“lady” really signifies in the mind of the
factory lass. The words “gentleman” and
“lady” were long ago fired out of the Best
vocabularies; but, queerly enough, among
many other folk the terms “man” and
“woman” are more or less regarded as an
insult. Over 30 years ago a criminal Judge
in this city upheld a prosecuting counsel’s
objection to a lydy witness being addressed
as “My good woman” by defending barrister
W. P. Forlonge. Since then it has become
the social fashion for “good woman” and
“good man” (especially the latter) to be
bestowed as an ejaculatory compliment on
smart persons who are shockingly unworthy
of the adjective.
The Children’s Hospital will get a finan-
cial lift from a dinner staged at the Occi-
dental by the proprietress, Miss Monk. It
was a very gay gathering, and was further
livened by a raffle for a case of cutlery.
Among the eaters were the Arthur Harper
pair. They have been sheltering at the
hotel since Mrs. Arthur recovered from the
operation to the arm which she got tangled
up in a mangle while doing her war bit in
the Wirths’ Park Rest Home.
Melbourne is to have another gallery for
the sale of paintings and antiques, and this
should make things all the better for
the Fine Arts establishment across the
way in Exhibition-street. They only
need a third to come along to create a
market thereabouts. The Sackville was to
be formally opened by the Mayor this Wed-
nesday, rank and fashion having conspired
to make it a “function” in aid of the Women’s
Hospital Appeal. The invitation is to view
the private collection of Dr. Constance
Ellis. Charity covers a multitude of pardon-
able stunts, and this is not the least
aesthetic of them.

MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Punters are a short-memoried breed. At
Canterbury Park (N.S.W.) on December 15, Pteropod,
carrying 9st. Blb. and conceding over 2st. to smart
young ladies like Girton Girl and Mollie 8., romped
home in a six-furlong sprint run in lmin. 13Isec.
—his third successive win. In the Carrington Stakes,
a fortnight later, the consistent animal was a close
fourth to Otacre, Trimacre and Vanti, and the rider
didn’t punch him out. Among those behind him in
the Carrington was Absurdum, ’who was receiving
121 b.; in the Auburn Handicap at Rosehill on Satur-
day. Absurdum had to give Pteropod 21b., yet there
was more public money for the worse-handicapped
and less trustworthy steed —there was even more for
the locally-trained \Virian, an indifferent performer
with Blb. overweight. The Pteropod stable got 3to
1 for their money, and Pike always had their gilt-

SON, trainer of

edged security in
front. King Carlos
(5 to 2) had another
easy job in the Rose-
hill Handicap, for
which Corncrake was
an even-money favorite.
The stewards decided
that the mare hadn’t
done her best, and
administered a 12-
months’ sentence to
Bryans, her owner-
trainer, and Meddick,
the jockey. Thereby
they showed themselves
no respecters of per-
sons, for Bryans is one
of the fashionable
Randwick trainers —he
handled Violoncello for
Samuel Hordern—but
the verdict has found
little support.
It was perhaps lucky for Scarlet's owner
that Stand By couldn’t start for the Sydney Gup.
At Morphettville on Saturday the son of Lanius—
Comedietta won the S.A.J,C. St. Leger, pulling up,
in 3min. 3sec. Certainly he hadn’t a Cup field to
beat, but Steel Bronze and King of Mirth, who
chased him home, are not half bad, and Dempsey
never moved on the beautiful black. St. Roseate
(St. Anton —Rose Morn) led from barrier to judge’s
box in the £lOOO Goodwood Handicap and returned
a dividend of £23 19s. on the £1 machine—a
great price for a horse that had run a good third to
Denacre and Golden Cock last year. Kibano’s
moderate second earned a profit of £5 9s. for those
who risked 20s. on him; Shanky, the other place-
getter, was one of the favorites. Other features of
the first day were Cadelgo’s defeat of Bradfield’s
three-year-olds, Graculus and Gungool, in the Fisher
Handicap; and Wynette’s failure in the w.f.a.
Elder Stakes —Leaheim (St. Anton—Quoin) pipped
her on the post after Simmons had tried to make a
runaway race of it on the mare. Leaheim must be
good, but Lord Alwyne’s daughter may have lost
some of the dash she showed in the Caulfield and
Williamstown Cups. No racehorse has had to work
harder for its oats this year.
“Nimslii”: What a mug is the small
punter who makes ante-post bets! Twenty-four
days before the Sydney Cup was run the postman
brought me a list of prices from one of the biggest
firms in the business. Of the 54 horses then in the
race eight were quoted at 100 to 1 (the longest odds
offered) and nine at 50’s. Not one of the 17 started.
Fourteen of the 21 runners could have been backed
on the Course at longer odds than were offered by
the ante-post banditti, the difference in some cases
ranging from 33 to 66 to 1. In another document
which came to hand 14 days before the race, the
winning Doncaster-and-Cup double was listed at
100 to 1. Yet anyone who fancied Whittier and
Scarlet could have run £1 into £374 by backing
them separately on the course. A pound all-up on
the Tote, the winning div. being merely 60 p.c. of a
pool from which 12A p.c. is deducted by the Govern-
ment and the club, w’ould have yielded, roughly,
£195. It’s a great game—for Dynamiteodds.
* * * *
“H. Hardupp” : It is hard to believe that
Oakes, the N.S.W. Chief Secretary, was not speaking
with his tongue in his cheek when he said that
“police activity prevented illegal gambling being
carried on in a flagrantly open manner.” My own
betting runs to a very occasional “fly” on the race-
course ; but if I wanted to back a horse s.p. in
Sydney I could get it on within five minutes in
one of a dozen places. Nearly every tobacconist
runs a “book,” and there is hardly a hotel bar
which is not visited on regular rounds by s.p.
bookies in search of customers, who often leave then-
betting silver with the barman. Nor is there a
large place of employment or g block of offices
without at least one agent for some layer of the
odds. Action is seldom taken except when a wife
complains about a husband “doing in” his wages at
a specified place. Then some pretence of “activity”
has to be made.
**■**■
“Machete” : The N. S. Wales pony-racing
commission was told by a recent witness that the
game was now blown to a bubble and that attendances
were falling off horribly. Something will have to be
done in the interests of dead-game sports, and the
arrival of a burrowing armadillo at Taronga Park
Zoo suggests a remedy. Advance notices say that
this beast is the world’s c-hampipn rapid burrower.
The writer, for one, is willing to wager that in the
echidna—or porcupine—Australia has something well
able to “set” the alien immigrant. What’s the
matter with starting burrow’ing races between the
home apd foreign breeds ? All sorts of races-
novices, welters, w.f.a. and plain ramps—could be
provided for. Handicapping would be a matter of
adjusting the hardness of the ground to be burrowed
in. The mob who live on the pony game would have
no difficulty in accommodating themselves to the
changed conditions. What they don’t know already
about underground work is not worth knowing.
Victoria’s head-of-the-river struggle, in
which four Melbourne and two Geelong schoolboy
crews took part, happened on the Barwon last week.
The final was a tight race between Melbourne
Grammar and Geelong Grammar, the latter sc raping
home by a foot, with Scotch College a length and
a quarter to the bad. The three crews finished in
their oi-der of weight, Geelong being nearly three
stone heavier than Melbourne Grammar. Given a
heavier stroke, the Geelong youths would presumably
have won with something ifi hand. As it was, the
boat carried a No. 8 who .weighed 21 pounds less
than No.l, whereas Melbourne and Scotch respectively
had 141 b. and 191 b. more at the stroke than the
bow end. Still, the local crew, with their very
lightest man (9s. 81b.) at the “wrong” end, were
able to do the trick. Next year, and for another
year afterwards, the racecourse will be the Yarra.
Geelong gets the much beribboned festival every
third annual gathering. \
* * *
“Old Timer”: Do they specially fatten
lads for these public-schools boatraees (B. 8/5/’24)?
Twenty-five p.c. of the little boys, who rowed on
the Barwon were heavyweights. The Geelong Gram-
mar boat carried three 12-stoners and an infant
who made the indicator whirl round to 13st. 61b.
Another child, only two pounds lighter, rowed No. 5 in
the Melbourne Grammar boat, and his nearest neigh-
bors were 12st. 61b. and 12st. 12lb. Still, college
headmasters indignantly repudiate the suggestion that
these young giants are not discouraged when they
desire to prolong their sojourn at the school in order
to advertise it in sport. When I was a boy at one
of these academies, llrstone was considered a big
weight for an oarsman. There was a 12-stone
monster who sat beside me in my form, but even
among us kids, who were naturally prejudiced, there
was a feeling that it was time for him to become
a wharf-lumper or a bobby.

There were those who imagined that Sid
Godfrey could hold his own with any U.S. pug in
his division, Benny Leonard possibly excepted. But
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night Bill Grime
went 20 rounds to a draw with the lightweight
champion, to whom he was conceding 9jib., and
plenty of good judges thought Grime had won. Yet
it took Grime all liis time to break even with Fox,
whom Criqui knocked out in 11 rounds or there-
abouts ; and Criqui, again, was a mere punching-bag
for Dundee. Godfrey scored most of his points at
close quarters, the featherweight being the cleverer
“in the country” and with his head. There was
£1920 in the “house” and Godfrey got £5OO,
having been guaranteed that amount. Grime’s
share was £460.
“S.P.C.P.”: The tambourine has been re-
quisitioned for the widow of George Mendies (B.
8/5/’24), and a “monster benefit” is announced.
Which means that the burden of caring for the
bereaved family is to be transferred from Stadiums,
Ltd., to the N. S. Wales public, as far as the thing
can be arranged. Brisk young Labor politicians are
prominent in the appeal for alms. It would be
more consistent with their alleged zeal for the prole-
tariat to ask Stadiums, Ltd., to shell out the average
amount of compensation which has to be paid by
less-favored employers when union toilers are killed
on the job; and to work for (l) the compulsory
insurance of prizefighters and (2) the abolition of
the brutal 20-rounder, which has caused three deaths
in six months and a few days. But such proceedings
might offend the great John Wren, and Wren is one
of those employers who are not to be offended. Let
the Delprats and McKays of Australia be stigmatised
as “bowelless exploiters of the toiling masses;” hut
when proprietors of pony racecourses, bookmakers and
fat booze-vendors affect Labor sympathies, grovel,
comrade, grovel! Soady, one of the three recent
sacrifices to Stadium “sport,” was a schoolboy when
the drums ceased throbbing, but Dunstan and Mendies
both saw war service. Perhaps the R.S.L. people
will make it their business to see that returned-
soldier boxers and their dependants, the living and
the dead, get a fair spin.
Boxing in much better form than he had
shown since his accident, Spargo got the referee’s
decision in another 20-round contest with Joe Fox
at Melbourne. Fox, victorious in the first fight,
began as if he would win again, but the referee cau-
tioned him for ’oldin’ ah’ ’ittin’, and after that a
lot of the sting went out of his work. Still,
Joseph has made a lot of money in Australia. Not so
his brother George, who was decisively drubbed at
Brisbane by Demsky.
“Blobs”: The over-lieated colored athlete
is certainly aromatic (B. l/5/’24), but is Japheth so
much more grateful to the nostrils than Ham or
Shem under the same conditions? “Machete” might
test it by visiting a dressing-room where pakeha
footballers are getting rubbed down after a practice
in the gym. Or let him have a ringside seat at
a bruising match. And to get a yard-wide sample,
let the bruisers be amateurs.
A crowd of 20,000 saw the Canadian
Soccer team play a scoreless draw against a Metro-
politan XI in their first match on the Sydney Show
Ground. The Canucks are big fellow’s, and they
have a really good forward in Chapman, who played
BOB HARLEY,
the Canadian
captain.
a' dashing game. Half
a dozen times Chap-
man carried the ball at
toe the length pf the
field, and on numerous
occasions he tricked
his opponents, his
cleverness being un-
canny. Harley (centre-
half), Anderson (back)
and Mosher (goalie)
are other able foot-
ballers. The shooting
was bad, but in this
and other respects the
jide will improve—it
was only five days off
the boat. Gallen
(back), H. Spurway
(half) and Cartwright
(goal) were the pick
of the local lot. Cart-
wright’s saving was
particularly fine. But
the forwards were not
much chop.
South Sydney, favorites for the League
premiership, suffered a reverse in the second match
of the season, Glebe downing them by 8 to 6.
South played the second term without half-back
Johnson, who was ordered off by Umpire Neill, having
mistaken the Sports Ground for the Stadium. But
for that they would probably have won. Eastern
Suburbs, ably led by their humorous heavyweight,
“Bluey” Watkins, accounted for North by 28 to 11 ;
and the other winners were University (14 to 10
against Newtown) and Balmain (29 to 20 against
St. George). So far the form has been patchy, to
say the least, and unless N. S. Wales can dig up
another Burge, another Thompson and a trust-
worthy goaler, its chances of repeating its 1920
triumphs against the Englishmen look remote.
“Nitric”: A problem that will presently
worry the Bananaland selectors is whether Craig or
Thompson shall captain the State team against the
English XIII. Craig guided the maroons to victory
last year and Thompson has led an Australian side
into the field. Having played under both, I don’t
envy the selectors, but if I had their job I would
let my decision wait on the Ipswich (Craig)—
Toowoomba match. That affair has
become the biggest of its kind north of the N.S.W.
border, Brisbane football being on the wane.
* * * *
“G.R.” : Rugby League football is looking
up in Melbourne, and some sparkling games have been
seen on the Middle Park ground, in preparation for the
arrival of the Englishmen. Caples, the N.S.W. crack, is
in good form and makes some of his Opponents look
very slow. Darby, right winger for the Kiwis, is a
speedy youth and has developed a magnificent hurd-
ling swoop over his opponent’s head, which usually
lands him well over the line. There is only one
really satisfactory tackle for this manoeuvre —round
both ankles.
“Past Grammar”: The refusal of the Eng-
lish Rugby Union to sanction payment of “pocket-
money” to the All Blacks during their tour of
Britain has, of course, stirred up a lot of angry
buzzing in M.L. and N.S.W. Rugby circles. One
Union magnate, who ought to have known better,
declared that while the British players “belonged to
the leisured classes” Australians were workers who
could not afford the tour without the allowance of
a few shillings a day. Which is pure tosh. Not
one per cent, of British Union players are “leisured”
in the same sense as the amateurs of county cricket.
A great proportion of them are actual manual
workers, especially in Wales, the West of England and
Yorkshire The balance are university men, medical
students, clerks and the like. In the past, the
English Union has winked at the three-bob-a-day
payment to members of visiting teams and permitted
it, in at least one instance, when a British team
came here. Perhaps it would be wiser to go on
winking, but the thing is certainly against R.U. law.
* * * *
Melbourne’s tram strike cost the League
clubs a few pounds on Saturday, but in no way
affected the play, which was clever and exciting.
Fitzroy had a handy pull over Geelong throughout,
and amassed 97 points to 74, Moriarty contributing
his customary seven goals. St. Kilda played all
over Carlton most of the time, and it was only the
obscene kicking of their forwards that lost them the
game • Saints 9 goals 22 behinds; Carlton 13 goals
12 behinds. Similarly, Melbourne, by vastly superior
marking, kept well ahead of Collingwood until lemon-
time ; after that the Magpies piled on goal and
point till they got one to the good—62 to 61.
’Roy’s ex-skipper Rattray is training Melbourne in
the way they should go, and if he can put some
devil into them they will go far. South Melbourne
visited Essendon, but found their contract too big,
scoring but 59 points to the Dons’ 85. During the
week several barrackers were requested to contri-
bute fivers and tenners apiece to the revenue for fail-
ing to control their feelings at the previous Saturday’s
games. Also, a country umpire got a verdict ior
£2O and costs against a one-eyed critic who
had written to the local paper accusing him of
bias. Football is a serious business in Victoria —
far more serious than politics.
“Trekle”: Jack Moriarty (B. 8/5/’24) is being
compared by critics w’ith Albert Thurgood and Dick
Lee, who have hitherto been in a class of their own
among forwards playing Australian rules. From
now onwards, however, his task will be tough, for
opposing captains may be depended upon to choose
their most rugged and desperate back to shepherd
the young man and see that he handles the ball
as little as possible. It is one of the agreeable
customs of Australian football, and if the forward
gets knocked about in the process—well it’s “all in
the game.” Men who would have become wonderful
goal sneaks with a fair go have wilted under the
drastic treatment. Bayless of Richmond is a case
in point. He was the perfect forward until con-
tinual punishment made him erratic. Early last
year a spectacular swing to the nose knocked all
football out of him, and this year he is not worth
a game.
* * * *
“Kip” : Now that the football season has
arrived, it isn’t really worth Wilfred’s while to act
as our messenger-boy, so immersed is he in the
doings and prospects of his favorite Tigers. A bright
yellow and black tie distracts attention from the
untidiness of his shirt; a rosette of the same hues has
become a fixture in the lapel of his coat. His
enthusiasm impels him to practise drop-kicking with
the telephone-book, and more than one broken electric-
light globe can testify to his mastery of this art.
On Saturday week I was inveigled into one of the
numerous football arguments started by Wilfred to
enliven the dull routine. To my disparaging assertion
that the Tigers couldn’t beat the Inebriates’ Home
he was curiously attentive, for I had expected scorn
undisguised. When I went on to prophesy that the
Tigers would be obliterated by Geelong, he surveyed
me a little dubiously. “Aw, six t’ four to an old
bloke like .you,” Wilfred said. “No,” he went on,
“Two t’ one —a ‘tanner’ to a ‘tray’.”
“Andesite”: There are no champion
athletes at the Bananaland ’Varsity these days. W.
Harrison was the outstanding performer at the
annual sports, winning the mile (4min. 47 4-ssec.),
the 880 yards (2min. 7 3-ssec.), and the broad jump
(19ft. 2jin.). A. Macfie gathered both the hundred
and the 220, the former in 10 3-ssee. and the latter
in 24 3-ssec. But other times were far from flatter-
ing. The quarter-mile was won in 57 3-ssec. and the
120 yards hurdles in IBsec. Five feet lin. was good
enough for the high jump and 30ft. for the shot putt.
The intercollegiate athletic sports in Adel-
aide, still confined to St. Peter’s and Prince Alfred’s,
were won this year easily by St. Peter’s. The
juniors gave them a long lead, and promise well for
two or three years to come. A boy under 15, who
can do the hurdles in 17 seconds, as young Flood
did, must be pretty smart.
* * * *
“D.F.”: If one Peter Kirkham had lived a
century later, he might, with a little training and
coaching, have given Australia a leg up in the
Olympic Games. Peter was a broom-maker at the
Hobart Town Barracks a hundred years ago. Accord-
ing to the Colonial Times of 1827 he was prepared
to run a mile on the high road at any time in 41
minutes—not bad going even in these days.
* * * *
“15-30”: It is pretty certain that Gerald
Patterson will pick O’Hara Wood and himself for
all the important Davis Cup fixtures. Schlesinger or
Kalms may get a match if the result is beyond
doubt in the two first ties with China and Mexico,
but Wood must be preferred for the singles against
Japan. He feels confident that his shoulder will not
go back on him again, and, that being so, he
should lick the “second strings” among his opponents
and may account for one or two “firsts.” One
always remembers that he went very close to beat-
ing Anderson at Wimbledon, and just missed victory
when within match point against Manoel Alonzo,
the only non-American who has walloped Tilden
twice. Wood has a finer equipment of strokes than
Patterson, but lacks Gerald’s punishing service. If
the Australians reach the challenge round and Vincent
Richards is in the U.S. team, as seems likely, his
match with Wood ought to be thrilling. Richards,
a high-class volleyer, would be meeting an expert
at his own game.
* * * *
“Bail”: The English cricket team which
arrives in Australia in October is expected to bring out
a unanimous objection to the eight-ball over. “Plum”
Warner, voicing conservative English opinion in the
Morning Post, declares that Jack Gregory is a
supporter of the six-ball over on the ground that
the hurling of two extra missiles is conducive to
strain. Whatever Gregory feels about it, however, it
is not likely that the Australian Board of Control
will alter an arrangement that has been designed to
quicken up a pastime which tends to become languid.
Warner knows that the eight-ball over is allowed in
Australia, but appears to assume that it canpot be
enforced against a visiting English XI. He should
read “Addition to Rule 13,” which gives this country
the right without qualification, so it is up to him to
still his small voice on the question and urge his
countrymen to accept the position with the best grace
they can muster. Anyhow, the point could be settled
now r by a firm announcement by the A.B.C. To leave
it for discussion after the Englishmen arrive is
simply inviting unpleasantness.
* * * *
“Ex-Englishman”: Humphreys, the Sussex
lob-bowler (B. 10/4/’24), was dangerous to much
bigger game than a XV of Ballarat. I saw him at
Brighton (England) play havoc with a good part of
a strong Australian XI. His victims were Giflen
and Scott (twice each), also McDonnell, Alec Banner-
man, Bonnor, Midwinter, Palmer, Spofforth and
Boyle. His figures were 6 for 97 and 5 for 69 ; and,
by the way, most of the other wickets were taken
by Jesse Hide, then just back from acting as
cricket coach in South Australia, and now dead on the
same day as Humphreys. It used to be said that
Humphreys was dangerous only to men under
30. All the same, he took more wickets for Sussex
than anyone else that year, 1884, and at the lowest
cost, 16 runs per wicket.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: London Evening
News, selecting a world’s best cricket XI, includes
Hobbs, Macartney, Taylor (S’Africa), Challoner
(West Indies), Jack Gregory, Fender, Woolley, Hen-
dren, Tate and Ponsford. W. G. Grace is not men-
tioned. probably because he Ls dead, but he has as
much claim for selection in the side as some of that lot.

“In the Olympic Rugby football contests, France

O Latin island in the Slavic sea,
Where exiled Ovid wailed in elegiacs,
Heart up! regardless of Parisian glee
Or Yankee barrackers’ exultant chyacks.
In ante bellum years, I’ll guarantee
You knew no more of footer than the Dyaks.
Proficiency therein by now you’ll ken is
Not to be gained as quickly as in tennis.
Better to take your medicine than shirk
A game for fear of the defeat you’ll suffer.
You that between the Russian and the Turk
Were for a century or so a buffer
Should breed a race equipped for scrummage work
With toughened hearts and thews and sinews
tougher.
Now, by your fertile plains and gorges flinty,
Rugger I lay you’ll yet discern from shinty.
Elbowed by Magyar and Muscovite,
With brawl ng Balkans for your other neighbor,
You’re naturally competent to fight
With anything from scimitar to sabre.
To ground a ball behind two posts upright
Requires, be sure, no more determined labor,
And may ensure you fame in brighter fulgors
Than that which comes from boring holes in Bulgars.
Sons of a land where high traditions burn,
Where heroes scorned to live in servile squalor
’ Neath Turkish lords, you only need to learn
To pack, to line from touch, to pass, to collar
The flying back—and tables you may turn
Upon the champions of the Frog and Dollar.
In battle centuries-tried, the miscellanea
Of football you’ll acquire in time, Rumania.

1 submit that it is hardly fair for
i to charge the Melbourne Herald with
loc ? 1 - I wri ! ;erß (B - l/5/’24). The Herald
adopts an unfailingly encouraging attitude towards
youngsters on the Inky Way. There are daily oppor-
tumtms for free-lance work in its “Man About Town”
and other columns, and the weekly magazine section
is open to all comers. I agree that the writers are
not extravagantly rewarded”; but I never vet
found a market where they are.

~, Pon ! ke ■ printing-office dramatic society in
Wellington (M.L.) was doing a drama, and at a

and say “I’ve set fire to the house!” The type-
snatcher who was cast for the baker got cold feet,
and while waiting in the wings for his cue liberally
warmed them up with beer. At the fateful moment
other type-snatchers pushed him on. He tottered to
ta e centre of the stage under the breathless attention
of the audience, smiled largely and fatuously, shouted
i ve done the business 1 ” and staggered off,
having made the hit of the show.
“B.” ; G. C. Dixon, of Melbourne Herald, is off
to try his luck in London. But before he alights
m the Fog he hopes to have the material for a
unique travel-book under his hat. He aims to take
a look at Asia from Singapore to Tokio, and, before
v< muring across Siberia, he hopes to do Hankow,
Pekin and Manchuria. The invasion of Moscow has
been facilitated by letters of introduction to Soviet
representatives, and he is going there to see what
Bolshevism is like at close quarters. He only knows
one word of Russian, “vodka,” but doubts, whether it
is the passport to hospitality that it used to be.
“U.P.”; William Sowden, ex-editor of Adelaide
Register, has in his private library 160 books or leaflets
of verse published in the State. The earliest poem pre-
served is an effort entitled “A Farewell to My Native
Land, written by Mrs. Mary Thomas when she left
London for Australia. Mrs. George Stevenson, wife
ot the first editor of the Register, wrote the first
poem within the State. Women have been by far
, ® mo ? Prolific rhyme-builders in South Australia.
Although Sowden is* not very enthusiastic about the
quality of the poetry, he is pleased to find there is
no element of coarseness” in the local productions.

°nr . doesn3t S ive us any information
as to the dates of his writers. This is the most
elementary of errors 1 doubt whether his selec-
tions irom the poets whom he has included is as
good as it might be. I have seen far better poems
by - .if Souter and Da vid McKee Wright than are
printed here.... The most cheering thing about this
collection is the fact that the general level is
highest towards the end. I believe this would have
been more noticeable had the choice been more
intelligent.”
After parting, on April 1, with the Examiner,
which he had run for 30 years, Harry Bowditch, of
1 arkes, died before the month was out. Politically
Bowditch was a Freetrader, a single-taxer and a
strong prohibitionist; but his temperance views did
not prevent him from giving a helping hand to
Harry Morant (“The Breaker”) and other hard-
drmking, if less ill-fated, freelances. A yarn told
about Morant in Parkes is that he once rode his
horse into the newspaper office to deliver copy;
but that Morant story is told in most N. S. Wales
towns with newspaper offices which were on drink-
ing terms with “The Breaker.”
“I ford” ; “It must be 20 years since Rudyard Kip-
ling made his Empire tour and wrote his* ‘Song of
the Cities’,” writes Farmer Whyte in Sydney Tele-
graph, after quoting the Singapore quatrain. It’s
over 30. It wasn’t even in this century that in-
coming Governor Beauchamp was held to have
trampled rough-shod on local susceptibilities by send-
ing his “Birthstains” message of greeting from Albany
(W.A.) to Sydney. Rudyard made his Empire tour
in ’9l and ’92. The yarn went round the offices
in Melbourne in the former year that he was paid the
compliment of being asked to write the “Cup intro.”
(always a pretentious piece of journalism) for one
of the dailies. He declined; but David Christie Mur-
ray took the job in that or a neighboring year.
“Centurion”: Anotner link with Crimean davs
parted recently, when J. Paul, said to be the oldest
journalist in London, died at 84. He reported
the long-forgotten court-martial held on Lord Cardi-
gan, leader of the Light Brigade in its charge at
Balaclava. Capt. Logan, who brought the order to
Cardigan, charged with the Brigade and was killed ;
and as the General who despatched the order, what-
ever it was, was also dead before the court-martial,
nothing could be proved, so Cardigan and the
other accused were acquitted. The charge itself, like
that of the 21st Lancers at Omdurman in our own
time was a minor disaster; but Kinglake in one in-
stance and G. W. Steevens in the other whitewashed
the sepulchre.

YESTERDAY
In *5l, when Hargraves discovered gold, Australia attracted
to its shores hardy adventurers and stalwart men from all
parts of the old world. Many, disappointed in their quest
for gold, turned to the soil, and these farmers laid the
foundation of the fortunes which their sons and sons' sons
are to-day enjoying*
Lean, sinewy, drought-proof bullocks, harnessed with yoke
and rein, tugged with crude hand-made ploughs through
the virgin soil —the ploughmen following wearily in their
wake* Day in, day out, year by year, this monotonous toil
sent men to the comforts of the homestead too tired
physically to trouble about further exercise, too exhausted
mentally to read or even to seek amelioration of the hard-
ness of their lot*
Gradually the conditions relaxed to some extent by the
introduction of improved mechanical devices on the farm
—the horse-drawn plough taking the place of cumbersome
oxen* But
TODAY
with the advent of the CASE Tractor, a radical change
has come over the scene, and farming operations no longer
spell laborious monotony*
The plough-horse is a fast diminishing quantity, and it is
realised on every hand that better results, bigger crops,
and larger profits can be secured with far less labour by
substituting the CASE Tractor for horse-team work* By
means of this power tractor one man can do the work of
many, and a much larger area can be placed under cul-
tivation —often double as much —in the same time that
the horse-team occupies* Simplicity itself to operate, and
low in up-keep charges, the CASE never tires of its task,
but will work at any hour of the day or night, in extreme
cold or tropical heat, and on any condition of land* with
the highest degree of efficiency*

Bellini’s “La Sonnambula,” dating back
to an age when grand operas -were strings
of melodies and light orchestration waited
modestly on vocalism, is about the sweet-
est story ever sung thus far in the season
at Melbourne Majesty’s. A few flaws in
the performance, due to insufficient rehear-
sal, had no bearing on the charming treat-
ment of the name-character by Dal Monte,
or the graceful impersonation of Amina’s
perturbed lover by Borgioli, both prima
donna and tenor being in splendid voice. He
is evidently at his best as a serious-minded
adorer, subject to hasty misconstructions of
the case, while her specialty is artless ten-
derness. To hear her sing the sugary music
of the rustic sleep-walker was one pure de-
light : to see her play the character was an-
other. Moreover, the two principals were
ably assisted. Di Lelio presented a benign,
brotherly basso Count, who recognised the
difference between real and assumed maiden
modesty when it came his way; and Aurora
Rettore as Lisa, the jealous cat, sang her
minor lays brightly, and shrugged her shoul
ders in the foreground with much scornful
expression. Luigi Cilia, as a notary, gave
another good character-sketch, and Doris
Mclnnes, as an elderly Teresa, earned a
share of the commendation for Australian
talent. A great chorus sang its as
peasant inhabitants of the Swiss village.
* * *
“The Skin Game,” staged by Oscar Asche
at Melbourne King’s, is disappointing. Com-
pared with ordinary machine-made plays
Galsworthy’s odd-shaped melodrama is of
literary quality, of course; but calling it
tragi-comedy leaves it none the less melo-
drama. A spy-like maid sticks her head in
at her mistress’s boudoir doorway to listen
to incriminating conversations. She slinks
behind a screen and slinks out again, a pro-
ceeding that has no influence on the story.
Meanwhile her missus attempts to purchase
the silence of a stout gentleman by offering
him money or herself. Nothing comes of
either the lady’s secret interview or the
maid’s slinking. The melodramatic incidents
make no difference. They could be left out.
The whole of the second act, containing the
boudoir scene preceded by an auction sale,
might also be omitted without loss to
the story of Hornblower v. Hillcrist. A
flirtatious friendship between Hornblower‘s
young son and the other man’s young daugh-
ter might likewise be left out. It helps to
make detail, but is useless to the story.
What is this story? Hornblower, boastful
vulgarian, lias, thanks to potter’s clay in the
district, established works which promise to
drive the Hillcrists from their ancestral
home. Already he has played a dirty trick,
despite his promise given to Hillcrist, on
some cottagers. Achievement of his pottery
ends is not all a matter of business. He
has a down on Mrs. Hillcrist for her stand-
offishness towards his eldest son’s wife—
apparently the only woman in the Horn-
blower family. He hates the proud matron
after she has coldly insulted daughter-in-
law Chloe for daring to enter her domestic
circle at her own daughter’s invitation. Yet
the highly civilised, uncharitable matron is
mercifully silent about facts which would
make a vulgar woman violently venomous.
She has been told about Chloe’s lurid past.
She knows something, and will use it as a
cudgel on her amiable husband’s behalf if
Hornblow'er and his son do not retire from
their “skin game.” If they insist on trying
to oust the old-established family she will
spring the Revelation on them. They ask
for it, and they get it. Hornblower, the
blusterous, is ultimately blown out. Admit-
ting his plans frustrated, he threatens ven-
geance should he ever get the chance.
Mrs. Hillcrist is satisfied. Chloe tries to
commit suicide. Miss Hillcrist is sympa-
thetic to the sufferers, whilst her amiable
father deplores the fact that these social
conflicts, these “skin games,” these fights to
a finish, are dirty things to touch.
* * * *
. Ib a melodrama not easily made convinc-
ing, Oscar Asche is a forcible Hornblower.
or at least a natural Asche, and Mildred
Cottell is rather thinly effective as the
well-bred woman, insolently bringing inso-
lence to grief. Arthur Styan is unstrikingly
successful as old Hillcrist, while Mary Mac-
gregor is sometimes persuasive in the difficult
part of _ a loving daughter who calls him
.Dodo” instead of Dad. Doris Champion is
a white-faced Chloe of the deepest dye,.
George Blunt the bitter man of business
who rejects her desperate attempt at bribery,
and Greenaway, as the husband of Chloe
aforesaid, an unexpected volcano who ex-
plodes impressively. And there are others
who do their little bits very well in this
neatly mounted drama of diamond cut dia-
mond and the biter bit.

At Melbourne Princess’s a short revival
of “Tangerine” begins on Saturday. Hugh
Ward s other house, the Palace, will be dedi-
cated to Allen Doone. Doone is to do three
new plays in three weeks, and “O’Kelly
Detective,” is the first of them.
One more week of “The Cabaret Girl” will
see it through at Melbourne Royal; then
“Kissing Time.”
This week Melbourne Majestic has the
original “Tiger Rose,” Lenore TJlrich, wheed-
ling the man who has come to arrest her
lover. The route of the follow-on. “Good
Women,” is from Greenwich Village to
Monte Carlo, and many fine intentions are
abandoned on the way. Hoyt’s have dis-
covered that earthquakes have their uses.
Last week the Tokio smash was lined up to
have its photo taken, and now the San Fran-
cisco jar of 1906 has a chapter all to itself
in “The Shock,” a sweet tale of a banker’s
daughter and a philanthropic crook. The
other yarn, “The Wanters,” is less exciting,
but pretty Marie Prevost keeps the plot

from resting. ‘‘The Country Kid,” otherwise
Wesley Barry, has got a lien on the affec-
tions of Britannia supporters. The Melba
screens “The Silent Command,” in which the
hero puts up a record linger on the brink of
eternity.
The three Cherniavskys are back in Syd-
ney once again, and playing more than ever
like a heavenly choir—they simply get better
and better, each in his particular way.
Their concerts at the Conservatorium are
drawing crowded houses, and on Saturday
night the home of music rocked on a gale of
applause that made the tree in front bend
low till the tornado passed. Their opening
number was the Arensky trio in D minor
for piano, ’cello and violin. The ensemble
work in this big number was a masterpiece
of light and shade. Fiddler Leo’s chief solo
was Tartini’s “Devil’s Trill”; and probably
Sydney has never heard its technical hurdles
more lightly overcome. Pianist Jan inter-
preted his old: friend Chopin, while Max
Bruch, Mozskowski and Popper drew out
the cream and honey and purple vintage of
Mischel’s ’cello.

This (Thursday) afternoon Charles
Hackett has a matinee; and on Saturday
evening he sings his swan song at the Sydney
Town Hall. The singer has won favor with
Sydney audiences, Bratza, too, has won a
cosy corner in the memory—his fiddle has
a way with it.

“Ma Mie Rosette” finished subjugating her
monarch at Sydney Majesty’s last night; but
Gladys Moncrieff’s tuneful notes will be
heard for another week before the lady labels
her luggage. The farewell piece is the ever-
alluring “Merry Widow.”
** * *
“Aren’t We All?” still pursues the hilari-
ous tenor of its way at Sydney Cri. Poli-
ticians who never know how to dispose of
their hands elegantly when their tongues
are going hardest ought to go and see Dion
Boucicault.
At Sydney Royal dawn will continue to
rise over the Sahara, and Muriel Starr and
Frank Harvey to have vast quantities of
stress laid upon their souls, for another
eight days. On Saturday week “The Garden
of Allah” will give way to “Madame X.”
“Tons of Money,” which has proved just
about as good as it sounds, is in its penulti-
mate week at Sydney Opera House.

Noise is the striking feature of Sydney
Tivoli just now. Linn Smith’s jazz band
is the culprit, and its syncopated piffle plus
tame-goat acting is an experience to shudder
over. It is a blessed relief to turn to Flor-
ence Smithson, with her pleasant voice and
quiet artistry. Violinist Rene Rich is an
obliging maiden with a cheerful presence and
an inclination to produce the mechanical
drone of a cross-cut saw. Will Hay is still
conspicuous on the bill.

The scalping industry of the Red Indians
has been at a low ebb recently in Moviedom,
and it was Christianly considerate of Sydney
Lyceum to give the trade a lift by screening
“Pioneer Trails” this week. There is de-
picted, among other pleasant things, the
massacre of a caravan of early prairie set-
tlers. “Eden and Return,” projected from
the same operating-box, is a very enjoyable
“comic.” The Globe proposes a toast “To
the Ladies,” and it’s worth a hearty re-
sponse. Hoyt’s have dragged “Hook and
Ladder” inside, and it gives an insight into
shady politics and a fireman’s job. Hall
Caine’s “Eternal City” is at the same house.
“An Old Sweetheart of Mine” is one of
the looking-backward types, and the Strand
is giving it B.' and R. Trilby Clarke, well
known to local Poverty Pointers, has a big
part in “Just off Broadway,” at the Lyric;
and Edna Purviance, the Crystal Palace’s
“Woman of Paris,” still has the multitude
gasping over her chinchilla wrap.

Wirths’ Circus maintains itself in high
favor at Sydney Hippodrome. The seals can
do almost everything except sing, and the
Egochago bullfighters might make as lugu-
brious a pessimist as Dean Inge chortle.

Two picture-shows in Melbourne:—
At the Fine Art Society’s Gallery, Norman Lindsay
again pictures a world that is all flesh and Devii.
The technical facility of his etchings is admirable,
but one begins to yawn over the repetition of themes
and stencilling of types. The Lindsay girl is an
especially stagey convention, and when 40 or 00
of her are crowded into a drawing like “Little
Scandals,” the mere accidents of raiment in which
some have been caught do not lessen their infinite
monotony. The most original and charming of the
new efforts is “The Happy Barge,” and, judging by
the number of sales, this is the most popular with
the buying public. “The Ragged Poet,” of which
two or three trial proofs are hung, shows sundry
buxom maidens listening to a versifier with bated
breath, though to look at them you wouldn’t think
that poets would arrest their attention. “She
Arrives,” “Enter the Duke” and “Decoy” are
bright fancies, but “The Decoy” has a disproportion-
ate Venus with an unsightly pair of calves. “The
Pool” reveals Lindsay in a simpler mood, and some
of its aspects set one thinking of that delightful
master, Anders Zorn.
Miss O. A. Hawdcn’s show of water-colors at the
Athenaeum is worth a visit. She cannot paint
flowers and her figure work is not particularly
meritorious, but as a landscape artist in full and
confident control of her medium she has merit.
Curiously enough, she shines in the depiction of the
gloom and desolation which the Hun left behind
him in France, and her studies of the shell-shocked
remnants of Arras and other front-line places can
be regarded as her best.

Adelaide shows threaten to brighten up.
Melba has been in the city acting as publi-
city agent for a grand-opera season, guaran-
tees for which are now being taken up. And
Ken Duffield, who during 'a residence in Lon-
don had one or two revues to his credit, is
rehearsing a large and mostly amateur co.
very hard for a week of his “Healo” at the
Royal. Concerts are promised by Adel-
aideans who have gained recognition else-
where : Clifford Lathlean, Charlotte Grivell
and Merle Robertson. Adelaide has petted
Merle from childhood ; but a publicity agent
has now given her a Danish origin.
“SONNAMBULA.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Amina, betrothed to Elvino,
Is the happiest girl in the world:
Her innocent heart is serene-o,
Her beauty with purity pearled;
Her boy, full of bliss,
Doth delight in the kiss
Of his pearl of a girl
Who adores him like this.
Oh, his love for the maiden runs deep,
Very deep,
Till she seeks sweet repose
At the happy day’s close,
And walks like a ghost in her sleep,
In her sleep—
A sight to make seraphim weep.
The Count is a-flirting with Lisa,
Who lights him to bed at her inn ;
He makes pretty speeches to please her
(Her favors he liopeth to win—man of sin!).
A footstep he hears,
And Amina appears,
Whom he eyes with surprise
While the other girl sneers.
It does seem a little bit steep,
Rather steep,
When, so soon to be wed,
She lies down on his bed,
Having come to his room in her sleep,
In her sleep—
And the villagers waiting to peep !
They blush for the nymph in her nightie,
Their ready conclusions are base;
They guess Miss Amina is flighty,
And giddily going the pace.
Elvino thinks such is the case;
At first he is mad,
And denounces as Bad
His be-eautiful girl.
But at last he is glad ;
The truth strikes them all of a heap,
Of a heap,
When all the world knows
That her broken repose
Had been due to a walk in her sleep,
In her sleep.
(Ah, to wicked conclusions we leap!)
ALADDIN PANTO., AT SYDNEY
PALACE.
Tom Payne as Widow Twankey, and Hector
St. Clair as the laundry assistant.
Elvino’s lost faith in Amina
Returned like the sun after rain—
Returned like a flash when he’d seen her
Go sonnambulating again.
He wept for his anger insane,
And made her his bride;
So she slept by his side—
Oh, his wife was his “life,”
And his joy and his pride.
Still shadows despitefully creep
O’er matrons who take,
Ere the hubby's awake,
To slinking abroad in their sleep,
In their sleep,
To the neighboring pub in their sleep.
VICTORIA.

On a complicated business :—-
Looking backward at some publicity pars. con-
cerning the opera company in Melbourne, one per-
ceives evidences of upset among the principals even
in the first week. Scavizzi, for instance, was said
ere the season started to have been imported for
Butterfly, among other characters. But another
lady, the wife of tenor Piccaluga, has been Butterfly
from the outset. Before “Rigoletto” was produced
a publicity par. announced that Dal Monte would
have Aga Lahoska associated with her. When the opera
came to pass the Polish contralto had seemingly jibbed
at the minor part of Maddalena in “Rigoletto,” which
fell to Carmen Tornari, the prompter’s wife. Later
came the trouble regarding the “Trovatore” east,
after • Phyllis Archibald had scored a big success as
Azucena. Another performance with the same cast
was advertised, and then “unforeseen circumstances”
prevented it from happening. Anon a second per-
formance was announced for the following week, but
no word was said about the cast. Finally it was
arranged that Scavizzi would sing in “Trovatore” on
the Friday, but Phyllis Archibald’s name was con-
MOST UNBUSINESSLIKE.
THE BUYER: “You know you artists don’t
d'eserve to sell your pictures. You kept
me ’ere yellin’ out ‘Shop!’ nearly ’alf
an hour.”
spicuously missing, her absence being, as it were,
explained by her having to play Delilah on Saturday
afternoon. There’s an awful expenditure of diplo-
macy in running a grand-opera season without blood-
shed. They are all much of a muchness these singing
birds, whatever part of Europe they come from.
The late George Musgrove found a German co. un-
manageable. The last Australian grand-opera
company that J.C.W. organised had its internal dis-
sensions. When it was officially notified that a
certain rising young singer would take the name
part in a certain opera, another lady threatened to
resign after she had torn down the official notice.
So this other lady got the part, with the proviso
that she must apologise to the first lady for having
torn down her name and jumped on it.
“H.E.S.’': “Fax” won’t get general accept-
ance for liis statement (B. l/5/’24) that
the male opera chorus has justified its im-
portation. Neither in deportment nor in
singing is it to be compared with the local
girls, who alone supply whatever vivacity the
chorus possesses. The men are stolid and
ungainly; they gaze on Lucia’s lunacy and
Othello’s wife-beating with the same stodgy
impassivity that they exhibit in the revels of
“Bohbme” and “Carmen.” Also, their reliance
on the overworked prompter is painful.
“0.K.” : It is amusing to read the lauda-
tion bestowed on the Cherniavsky brethren
these times by critics who used to speak
slightingly of them. Because the three Rus-
sian artists had travelled for years as infant
phenomena, in black velvet suits and red
ribbons, writers who had noticed their
figures maturing but had not noticed their
art keeping in step with advancing age took
it for grauted there must be something cheap
and gaudy about their work. It was the
fashion with the Very Musical to find per-
fection in, say, a Verbrugghen quartet, but
nothing excellent in a Cherniavsky trio. The
last time they visited Melbourne, the youngest
of the three brothers (the ’cellist) being then
baldheaded, they gave three concerts only in
the little Assembly Hall. Their playing was
delightful, but they were not in the boom.
Now, however, they are under J.C.W. aus-
pices, and their talent will be recognised for
all it is worth. No longer will they be
disparaged on account of a fondness for
Mendelssohn, or for daring to be brilliant
when they might have been correctly dull.
“A.P.” : “La Sonnambula,” which has been
revived by the opera co., hadn’t been
done in Melbourne since 1892, when Wil-
liamson and Musgrove took over the songsters
whom the Simonsens had imported the year
before. Australia he'ard it for the first
time in 1857, when Anna B.isliop was the
heroine. Lucy Escott sang the name-part
frequently, and other Sonnambulas were
Rose Hersee, Madame Coy and lima De
Murska. It was in the Lyster production
of 1879 that Verdi’s rich baritone was first
heard in these parts.
“A.P.” : The strains of “La Sonnambula”
call to mind the antics of Greville and G. 11.
Rogers in Akhurst’s pantomime of “Har-
lequin Jack Sheppard” in the old Ilay-
market days. Greville, as Jonathan Wild,
and Rogers, as the widow Sheppard, bur-
lesqued a “Sonnambula” scene, and the music,
sung in a piercing falsetto while Rogers was
doing the sleepwalking business (he carried
a candle five feet long), remains in my
memory yet. Margie Chester and Mrs.
Greville were in that panto.
“R.G.N.C.”: I never knew what an
American Consul looked like till I saw one
impersonated by an imported tenor in the
Williamson-Melba opera co. His outfit com-
prised a blazer sort of sac coat worn over an
evening-dress vest, with which was affected
a screaming scarf tie knotted into a bow.
The light-hued pants were turned high to
show check silk socks patterned like a
golfer’s. High-lows followed to the south’ard.
The whole was crowned with a Homburg
hat —green.
“Norbell”: “Ma Mie Rosette” (B.
l/5/’24) was produced in the middle ’nineties
at the Prince of Wales’s, Coventry-street,
London. The speculator was young Wil-
liam Boosey, of the big publishing firm;
and the cast included the ill-fated EugSne
Oudin (he died at 39, just as his talent was
really appreciated), Juliette Nesville, Cour-
tice Pounds, Jessie Bond and Frank Wyatt.
Oudin got £BO a week, Miss Nesville £5O,
Jessie Bond and Pounds £4O each, and
Wyatt £45. The Prince of Wales’s is only
a little theatre, and the piece was taken off
after a few weeks’ successful run because
the house couldn’t pay the salaries.
“Orb”: George C. Miln (B. l/5/’24) pro-
duced “Othello” at Melbourne Opera
House on September 14. 1889. This was
the full cast: Duke of Venice, Collett Dob-
son ; Brabantio, Harry Hodson; Gratiano,
Evan Winston ; Lodovico, William Duggan ;
Montano, J B. Atholwood; Othello, Geo. C.
Miln ; Cassio, Arthur Greenaway; lago, Nat
Douglas; Roderigo, Alfred Rolfe; Ist Mes-
senger, Harry Hill; 2nd Messenger, Clement
Wakefield; Paulo, Andrew Money; Emilia,
Kate Douglas; Desdemona, Louise Jordan.
Of these Collett Dobson, Harry Hodson, J.
B. Atholwood, Arthur Greenaway and Harry
Hill are still on the active list. Alfred
Rolfe, who married Lily Dampier, is living
in Sydney. Kate Douglas is still on deck
also, and her son, Alan Douglas, was “on”
in Oscar Asche’s recent production of
“Othello.”
“T. 0.1.”: My memory has a longer span
than even “T.P.’s” or “Up Stage’s” (B.
8/5/’24). I saw G. V. Brooke, William
Hoskins and Barry Sullivan play Richelieu.
With Brooke were Henry Edwards, Har-
wood and Harry Jackson ; with Sullivan, Heir
and his wife. Sullivan had “words” with
the Argus, James Smith being the writer.
One night—l was present—when he had to
say “Beneath the rule of men entirely
great, the pen is mightier than the sword,”
he substituted “just” for “great,” with a
meaning glance at the critic. I consider Hos-
kins the best reader of the part, but
Brooke’s impersonation has left the most
abiding impression. G.V. was majestic as
he strode round Julie, drawing the “Hallowed
Circle of our Solemn Church.”
“Orb”: Touching stage versions of Marie
Corelli’s novels (B. l/5/’24). Alfred Dam-
pier perpetrated a dramatisation of “The
Vendetta,” calling it “The Count’s Millions.”
I have a tragi-comic memory of the earth-
quake happening before it was quite due, and
of the old man heroically supporting a couple
of tottering “set pieces” what time he deli-
vered an impassioned speech.
“Thersites” : William Hoskins (B. 1/5/24)
did Richelieu here in 1856. Thirty years
afterwards, at the Actors’ Fund dinner in
London, Henry Irving said that London
would have been at Hoskins’s feet had he
played Richelieu there.
AN EMOTIONAL PART.
“What do you do if you happen to forget your lines?”
“I repeat the multiplication table in a muffled voice. The other
wight positively I had the whole house in tears over nine
elevens are ninety-nine.”
“Second Murderer” : Maud Williamson was
a prolific adapter of plays. Besides Cor-
elli’s “Barabbas” she dramatised Hall Caine’s
“The Deemster,” “The Manxman” and “The
Christian.” She also did Marion Crawford’s
“Palace of the King” and Conan Doyle’s
“Rodney Stone.” Maud came to Australia
supporting Janet Achurch and Charles Char-
rington in ’B9, and played many parts here
for 10 or 12 years under various manage-
ments. Perhaps her best-remembered per-
formance was Ayesha (Potiphar’s missus), in
Rignold’s production of Rev. George Walters’s
“Joseph of Canaan.” Jimmy Hazlitt war
Potiphar.
“Oldtyme”: Heaven forbid that I should
be “less than just” to Nellie Mortyne, as
“Very 0.T.” (B. 8/5/’24) complains. When
I said the much-travelled actress had been
handicapped by “foggy tones” I meant it to
be inferred that, as an actress of all sorts
of parts, she has a wider range of ability
than her voice has. Anyone who suggests
that her vocal tones have been her fortune
on the stage is less than just to her. Regard-
ing my remark that on her recent appearance
in “The Cabaret Girl” she “found herself
almost forgotten,” I can only say that she was
not nearly as well remembered as she ought
to be. I heard a pressman ask: “Who is
this Nellie Mortyne?”
“Te Pana”: At Gisborne (M.L.) Opera
House recently Stanley McKay played Sliaks-
peare and pantomime on the one bill —the
Garden scene from “Twelfth Night” and “Old
Mother Hubbard.” Oscar Asche doing
“Cairo” and a harlequinade could not have
been more versatile—or successful.
“D.” : If the parson-hero of a Yankee sex
film presented himself for registration in the
great society ballroom scene without trous-
ers, the Hollywood perdoocer would presum-
ably scent a solecism, and send him away to
get a pair. But where war scenes are
concerned there is no such discrimina-
tion. In “Flapper Wives” the men in the
front-line dugout haven’t a box respirator
between them, and the apogee of imbecility
is reached when the chaplain reels off through
bursting shrapnel and h.e. without any sort
of mask. By the time the Yanks reached
the line he would, of course, have been
arrested for going so unclothed even in a
back area.
“Thersites”: “Ma Mie Rosette,” now re-
vived at Sydney Majesty’s, has always suf-
fered from a weak tenor. The ordinary
comic-opera person has never been equal to
it. The part of Vincent is dramatically and
vocally stronger than that of Henri. When
Kenningham played it he got a “reception”
on every entrance in the second act, the audi-
ence was so keyed up. But Kenningham
could act as well as sing, as Nellie Stewart
says in her book.
“Alwyn” : Reg Thornton, who became a
favorite at Sydney Tivoli and has since gone
to S’Africa, was grounded at “Shore,” other-
wise Sydney Church of England Grammar
School. He used to report the school foot-
ball matches for the “Shore” magazine, and
played in the college XI with R. J. A.
Massie and Jack Gregory. Later on he was
a member of the Glebe first-grade XI —it
was in Glebe that he was born. It is rare
for a cricketer to show any talent for a
footlights job. Still Austin Punch owns a
fine baritone. And there was Syd Deane.
“Dido”: George Rignold was playing
“Othello” at Melbourne Royal, and, as there
was trouble with the hands, for one night he
had the services of a tyro squirting the lime-
light. The inex-
perienced limp-
shooter had been
given his instruc-
tions. He had to
pick Handsome
George out of the
crowd, and spot-
light him all the
time. “Himes” was
very conscientious
■ —he succeeded in
finding Rignolq
every time, but
always after a
hunt; and then he
dogged him round
the stage in a most
disconcerting way,
always on his
heels, but ever a
trifle late. The
audience got on to
the hunt presently,
and the whole
house giggled when
in the last scene
Limes lost his
quarry and went
hunting all over
the stage for him.
While the light was
ducking and dodg-
ing in a way sug-
gestive of great
agitation, a voice
in the pit cried :
“Look under the bed, you fool—look under
the bed !” George smothered Desdemona in
a gale of laughter.
“T. 0.1.”: How many Aladdins has Aus-
tralia seen? Ada Reeve is the latest; the
first was Julia Mathews, who appeared
along with the Wonderful Lamp at the old
Princess’s Theatre, Spring-street, Melbourne,
in the early ’sixties, when George Fawcett
was lessee. Fawcett was Widow Twankey.
Norman Campbell’s opinion :
“Oldtyme” (B. 1/ 5/’24) chastises Nellie Stewart
for writing that Henry R. Harwood, in his latter
years, was behind the times as a low comedian. I
think the lady is right. Harwood was ponderous
in comic operas like “La Maseotte” and “La
Petite Mademoiselle.” His style was too mechanical
for such pieces. In the straight stuff, however, he
retained all his old punch—without the Judy, so
to speak. But I question whether Nellie Stewart
was ever “stuck for something to do” in “Tambour
Major” while Harwood held the stage. Comic operas
were not “produced” like that, especially under
George Musgrove’s eye. Every arch look, gesture
or bit of “business” was rehearsed till the performers
could do it in their sleep. About the last time that
Harwood played in “Tambour Major” was when
Robert Brough was in the title-r6le. Nellie Stewart
was then the Stella, with Fanny Liddi&rd as the
Drummer-boy.
“Shadow S.”: They had an all-Australian
night at our cinema theatre last week, and
I went along to give home industry a lift.
I remained to the bitter end, reasoning that
the second picture couldn’t be worse than
the first —and it wasn’t, although the story
was unpleasant enough. While Dad is
waiting for the drought to break, his heir
is keeping an expensive “establishment”
and forging heroically in the process. He
succeeds in bringing the old man down to
driving a garbage-cart, while Mum runs a
pie-stall and her daughter gets a job as
waitress. After the unpleasant characters
have been extinguished by a particularly
sordid murder and suicide, the husband of
son’s lady-love intervenes as fairy godfather,
and they all live happily ever after. That
was the second picture; in the other the
characters arrived from England in a sail-
ing ship to go to the diggings, and settled
in a town where the police wore 1923 uni-
forms and the hoardings were plastered with
advertisements for the Whirl’s Refuse. I
can forgive much to the pioneers of an in-

LA BOHEME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Twas Mimi, pale and all distraught with woe,
Who in the limelight piped a tuneful lay;
She was the 'victim of disease, and so
Was fading from this wicked world away.
Weep for a rag, a hank of hair, a bone—
Poor Mimi weighs a paltry fourteen stone!
The histrionic boards creaked ’neath her tread;
The tenor crumpled up when in his arms
She paused a while to rest her. weary head.
The audience grinned at her abundant charms ;
And when of wasting hapless Mimi spoke
All marked the waist, and sniggered at the joke.
1* rom act to act she lumbered, and it seemed
She waxed more monstrous as the play progressed ;
She much protested and het hot tears streamed
As she her hopeless case so sadly stressed;
But in the public’s unromantic view
More vigorous still the hearty actress grew.
And when the girl was dying she appeared
So stout and healthy none believed that day
She strove in fell ccnsumption’s clutch. They cheered
When Mimi broke the bed on which she lay.
’Twas not consumption grim that killed the part,
But fatty degeneration of the art.
VICTORIA.

Polish and Protect
Floors, Woodwork
and Furniture with
Johnson's Polishing Wax
You can give every room in your home
that delightful air of immaculate clean-
liness by using Johnson’s Polishing Wax
occasionally on your furniture, wood-
work, floors and linoleum. It imparts a
beautiful, hard, dry polish which will not
show heel and finger prints or collect
dust and lint. Johnson’s Wax cleans,
polishes, preserves and protects —in
one operation. Easy to apply and polish.
WAX All Your Floors
and Linoleum
It will make them beautiful easy to
care for —they won’t be slippery—and
will not heel print. JOHNSON’S
WAX is the most economical floor pol-
ish. Floors finished with it never require
expensive refinishing, for walked-on
places can be easily re-
waxed as worn spots ap-
pear, without going over
the entire floor.
The easy way to wax
floors and linoleum is
with a Johnson Weighted
Polishing Brush. It spreads
the Wax evenly —polishes
the floor easily and
is an ideal floor duster.

Through all their centuries the beauti-

and palaces have known no finish but
wax. Perfectly preserved—the waxed
wood mellows and glows with the years.
This same beautiful finish can be easily
duplicated on the floors, woodwork and
furniture of any Australasian home
with Johnson’s Polishing Wax.
The Ideal Furniture Polish
Johnson’s Liquid Wax is a perfect fur-
niture polish. It imparts a hard,
glass-like lustre which will not gather
dust and lint, or show finger prints.
Johnson’s Liquid Wax takes all the
drudgery from dusting. It adds years
to the life and beauty of varnish.
Johnson’s Polishing Wax is conveni-
ently put up in three forms.
Use the Paste Wax for all
floors —wood, linoleum,
tile, marble, etc. We rec-
ommend the Liquid Wax
for polishing furniture, pho-
nographs, woodwork, lino-
leum, leather goods and
motor cars. Johnson’s Pow-
dered Wax will immedi-
ately put any floor in perfect
condition for dancing.

The Mechanical Force of Today
THE firm Westinghouse demonstrates to the world what can be
accomplished by master minds centralizing their efforts on
one particular element.
Electricity is but as of yesterday. However, the honest, con-
scientious endeavor of Westinghouse workers has so improved its
application, that the benefits redounding to the help of human
kind have made it invaluable.
Electricity has lightened the burdens of man; made the world
brighter; labour easier and quicker.
Westinghouse, by creation and invention, has contributed a
great share to the present perfection in electrical devices. Every
piece of apparatus made by Westinghouse can be relied upon
to be mechanically and electrically correct.
In an angirig for the distribution of its products in Australia,
Westmghouse will be pleased to hear from firms interested in
acting as distributors.

REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance-sheet as at 15th October last, with the Profit

tralasian rates and taxes, and making provision for bad and doubtful debts and other contingencies, the

To this has to be added £121,868/18/5, brought forward from the previous year’s account, making
a total of £740,427/17/1. From this total the Directors have appropriated £520,000, representing, for
the year, a Dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, and Bonus of 3 per cent., both free of Income Tax. Of
this £260,000, equal to 6/6 per share, was paid on sth October last as an interim dividend, leaving
£260,000, equal to 6/6 per share, for present distribution. £lOO,OOO was been appropriated to the
Reserve Fund- • £120,427/17/1 will remain to be carried forward to the next account.
The Dividend and Bonus will be payable, in London and in Australasia, on 28th instant.
In June last the Right Hon. Viscount Chelmsford, G.C.5.1., G.C.M.G., was elected by the Directors
to a seat on the Board, to fill the vacancv caused by the death of Sir Harold A. Stuart. The Directors
new record that, in consequence of his joining the Government as First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord
Chelmsford resigned his seat in January. . , r _. . , T ~ „ _„ _ „ ~
The Directors retiring by rotation are:—Frederick V. C. Livmgstone-Learmonth, Esq., D. 5.0., Harold
Nelson Esq., and Charles E. Barnett, Esq., who, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The Auditors, Messrs. Deloitte, Plender. Griffiths and Cq., offer themselves for re-election.
Since the date of the last Report new Branches have been opened at 71 Collins Street East (Mel-
bourne) and in the Melbourne suburbs of Coburg, Malvern and Middle Brighton, and at 202 William
Street and Bondi Junction, Sydney. . , XT , , .
In October last a Branch Office was opened m the West End of London, at 17 Northumberland

Yes, it’s a fact it brings prosperity, because
not only does it replace 8 horses on the farm for ploughing, harrowing, seeding,
harvesting, hauling, etc., but it works quicker, turns shorter and will work right
on for 24 hours on end, if necessary, without getting sore shoulders. It saves and
makes money by doing work impossible to horses, for with its power it pumps water,
saws wood, cleans tanks, threshes the grain, and does scores of other jobs about
the farm. Don’t take our word for it, but ask a Cletrac owner.

rhyme and says nothing new or strange... .W.H.G.:
Rambles on without mirth... .Jackstaff: Not enough
interest... .Ripponlea; So much for our boasted
judicial system:—
During a family disputation,
A young man developed an aberration.
With a beerbottle his father did he bash,
Who lobbed on the floor with a terrible crash
His skull he continued to batter,
Till all over the walls his brains did he scatter.
He gazed wildly around,
And his terrified mother he found,
Crouching behind the baby’s chair;
He leaped at her with terrible stare.
He then proceeded to choke,
Till her face colored up like a beet.
She just give a grunt and a croak,
And lobbed with a thud at his feet.
He was subsequently captured and tied,
In the next session was he tried.
When the jury filed into the court,
The wretched young man was acquitted.
And the Judge feelingly remarked that he thought
Such an orphan was more to be pitied.
. ...T.T.R.: The form is bad and the matter un-
exciting. .. -E.M.H.; Good; but not good enough.
. ...M.S. (Toowoomba): Fails rather badly....
G. du C.: Not for us J.M.0.: It gets wilder as
it proceeds to its shouting racketty end... .P.R.S.;
Poor stuff... .S.S.A.: Limping and unoriginal verse.
....Tannock: The “Moths” don’t attract u 5....
C.C.M.: That has been done better too often....
K.A.M.: It joggles and wallops painfully. .. .S.A.J.:
Weak and thin... .L.L.A.: Choked by a rank growth
of commonplace Lex Terrae: Its joints are of
wood, and the lines mostly spring backwards....
O.S. (Mosman) : Far too weak... .K.N.0.: No use
sending us prose painted to look like verse....
Propstick: Delighted to meet Mr. Bliskers:—-
A kind man was old Bliskers,
With heart so soft and fem.,
He would not shave his whiskers
For fear of hurting them.
....Lilias G.: Not up... .A.R.N.: The prose is as
bad as the verse, which amounts to an achievement.
... .S.S. (Parramatta) : Both fail. .. .0. Gee: it
gets nowhere.... Billo C.: Far too rugged
K.S.A.: Mostly commonplace. .. .D.M.S.: Doesn't
strike us. .. .A.F.D.: Fluttered feebly in rhyme and
then died out in no rhyme at a 11... . James N.:
That yarn was told in Abraham’s youth... .D.A.M.:
A sonnet must be a lot better than yours.... Joy J.:
Doesn’t get near A.S.D.; Too feeble to stand on
its own feet....E.E.S.: Parodies are generally evil
things; and yours is an evil sample.... Moyah Kay:
Very bad indeed... .D.F.F.: The ideas are feeble and
the verse flimsy.... Augustus W.: The clarity of
the style is attractive: —
I invited happiness to enter.
I opened the door of my hearth.
I invited it so tender,
That we two should never part.
Under the Vail of Happiness vyas sorry,
It entered in a smiling hypocritie way,
It brock my heart and made me worry,
I can feel it sadness to this day.
Happiness and love is united,
It is followed up, by dead and hate.
Hate and love are devited,
Either sooner,, takes dead, as his mate.
J.H.C.: Not our line.... Vixie W.: Doesn’t say
anything H.N.D.; Not up W. J. : For something
enterprising in the way of rhymes, this takes a
prize:—
Our fighters were proven in Europe,
Palestine heard the ring of their stirrup ;
They will face any foe, ’
Shot for shot, blow for blow,
With a dash that should make your heart cheer-up !
. ...T.8.W.: Now where did you see Australian
bushmen doing things like that? And no tender
feelings—rubbish! They’re the most sentimental
people in the wide w0r1d.... Black Bream: You
don’t lie with much imagination....L.R.S.: Come
down off those stilts and talk naturally Alfred
M.; Certainly; there’s room in every section of the
paper... .R.8.H.: Who’s going' to be the better,
d’you think, for consuming such filth?... .Clodhopper:
You take too long to get there.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
H.M.H.: You scratch like a hungry hen... .0.0. H.:
The tennis twins going back. .. .R.H.: The scene
didn’t “excite poetic reflections” here either....
R.C.: Drawing several feet below the mark....
C.G.: Ancient gag feebly illustrated.... M.E.W.:
Blobby little sketch no use... .M.G.: Some promise;
but line wants a tonic. .. .D.W.: No drawing there.
.-. .-.R.K.: The worst cow to date .XLE.T.S.: Did
the Boston (U.S.A.) editors really publish pictures
like that and live? W.A.H.: All out... .E.1.L.:
Your sense of perspective is in need of repairs....
L.G.8.: Weak in matter and manner... .F.A.S.:
Doesn’t give you an intro, to the cashier.... H.C.:
A bad miss.., .N.8.5.A.: Drawing hopelessly weak.
. ...W.H.D.; All making tracks for home... . A.H.:
A dud.... A.E.; If you are determined to go on
spoiling paper take some drawing lessons.... F.P.:
Foreground and background values too nearly identi-
cal... .W.H.S. and J.A.C.: Not up.
“Zenocrates”: Few people who see the offi-
cial turning of a sod or laying of a founda-
tion-stone realise how old this form of cere-
mony is. On an old mace-head at Oxford
may be seen a representation of King Nar-
mer, a forerunner of Tut in Egypt, carrying
a hoe to open the trenches and thus give the
official signal for the fertilising Nile to get
to work. The date is about 2000 B.c. With
such a precedent a Ministry with plenty of
leisure might make quite a picturesque event
of the re-opening of the Sydney water supply
to gardeners after the pretty-regular annual
closure.

“J.A.”: The s.s. Cambridge, which re-

ever left Australia. She has 152,730 bags,

tons. The previous record was held by the

‘"Sturt” : Osborne, the new settlement on
the sandy peninsula between Port Adelaide
River and the sea, gets another boost with
the resolve of S.A. Gas Co. to put up
works there. The Electric Supply Co. and
Poole and Steele’s shipbuilding yards gave
it a start; now the Gas Co., its old location
close to the city having been outgrown, has
taken up 35 acres northwards towards the
Outer Harbor. One quite incidental result
of the conversion of these long frontages of
mangrove swamps into wharves is the en-
couragement of motor-boat and other river
championships, ample facilities for watching
the contests being now available.

“Cuzenos”: One of the most successful
soldiers’ settlements in Australia is at El
Arish (N.Q.), where some 75 returned men
were allotted scrub blocks of doubtful sugar-
land. Each settler went to work on a credit
of £625, from which to finance the working
of 10 acres of cane and supply himself with
house, plant and other requirements. The
money is to be repaid by instalments over a
long term. Few of the prospective farmers
had much experience of agriculture, but
nine out of ten have kept their blocks,
most of them are now comfortably off, and
two have been able to shout themselves a
trip to Wembley. The success of El
Arish suggests that many other undeveloped
wastes in North Queensland could be trans-
formed into prosperous districts under the
same system of group settlement.

“P.X.”: Two or three weeks ago The
Bulletin printed a paragraph of mine re-
lating to an extraordinary circular issued by
the N.S.W. Association for the Advancement
of the Blind. This circular called upon the
subscribers to the Industrial Blind Institu-
tion to stop giving anything more until three
discharged, blind men had been reinstated.
The Association for the Advancement of the
Blind is, it seems, a registered trades union.
Last year its income (inclusive of £l6 Bs. 3d.
members’ fees) was £629. The blind re-
ceived (by way of loan) £l4; collectors’
salaries and office exes, amounted to £525.
How does such a body come to be registered
as a trade union? Is it one of the plans
adopted by Trades Hall bosses to get hold
of some dependable followers? Incidentally,
both the union’s two auditors are alleged to
be blind.

“Bill o’ the Barges” takes a tow: —
The recent tow of the small steamer Kara from
Port Chalmers to Sydney by the Union steamer
Waikouaiti was one of nearly 1400 miles. There
ai e other memorable tows, some even longer, to the
credit of the same co.’s cargo boats. It was the
Koonya that towed the Aurora south to the ice-pack
on the last southern voyage of that vessel. The Karori
in 1917 took the American barque Lyman D. Foster
from Suva to Auckland, 1200 miles. The Retriever,
another American barque, was towed by the Kaiwarra
from Papeete to Auckland. She figured in Peter B.
Kyne’s book, “Cappy Ricks.” This tow was over
2000 miles. But the most sensational tow by a
Union steamer occurred 23 years ago when the
Mokoia picked up the disabled Monowai 400 miles
off the coast and towed her to Port Chalmers. The
Monowai, with a full passenger list, was due to
reach Melbourne from Bluff in time for the Mel-
bourne Cup. Her tailshaft broke on the second day out.
The Mokoia was the next boat on the run. At 8
o’clock one evening rockets were seen on the star-
board beam. A compass bearing was taken, and the
Mokoia was turned. At 11 o’clock she was close to
the Monowai. Captain Chatfield had the gear and
boats ready, and with the able handling of the
Mokoia by Captain Spinks the line was made fast
to the Mokoia’s bitts soon after midnight. It
was lucky that the Mokoia found the Monowai, for
the former vessel’s lights when seen were hull
down on the horizon, and it was as a forlorn hope
that the rockets were sent up.
THE HEARING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Excuse us, will you, Mr. Jawe,” observed the Court.
“We know the law, or think we do. We’ve seized
the fact the case turns on. The way to act seems
to our minds as daylight clear; and so, although
we have no wish to interfere, or stop your argu-
mental flow, we think, perhaps, with all respect,
the case might end—if you elect. It’s occupied us
several days: you’ve thrashed it well, there’s not a
haze or fog of doubt, inside or out, or point that
one could fairly raise. This course we venture to
suggest—we know that counsel does what’s best. ’
Then Mr. Jawe, with aspect pained, arose aghast.
His voice was strained, his eyes astare, his curled
horse-hair quivered with grief he scarce could bear.
“I trust the Court does not impute that I, in this
or any suit (his indignation here was prime), that
I —l have been wasting time? No such reflection
now should mar my long experience at the Bar;
wherein I’ve learnt the style, the pace, to properly
conduct my case, in this or any other action, entirely
to my satisfaction, without advice or foolish ques-
tion, judicial prompting or suggestion. If I should
concentrate or stop whenever such suggestions drop,
who knows what unsuspected point might queer me?
Surely the Court will always hear me!”
How could a protest of this sort fail to impress a
thoughtless Court ? His Honor, with some show of
fright, hastens to put the matter right.
“Pray, Mr. Jawe, do not infer that we would cast the
slightest slur, or offer comment or reflection upon
your conduct and direction of your own case. We d
like to state how highly we appreciate the way
you handle plaint or bill, your learning and for-
ensic skill, your promptness to assist the Court....
(And much more of the like import—-for lack of
space we cut it short.) Anything that the Court
observed was quite impersonal. It served no pur-
pose, object or relation to your habits—methods—
reputation. Wherever luck or skill may steer you,
howe’er remote, of course we’ll hear you. Yes, yes!
And you, too, Mr. Brass. We don’t forget your
rights. Don’t let a suitable occasion pass. We’ll
hear you at each turn and wind ; in fact, whenever
you’re inclined —whichever way your fancy turn. Dear
me, it’s four! We’ll now adjourn. To-morrow, same
time, court and place. Yes, costs in the cause
in any case.”
Thus, while remonstrance gently flows, from day to
day the hearing goes.

Taking Melbourne for a ride
FANCY a fleet of motor cars,
lined up and ready to take every
man, woman and child in a city
the size of Melbourne for a ride. It
would be quite a group, to be sure,
yet the number of Studebaker cars
sold during 1923 —more than 145,-
000 cars —could do just that. Isn’t
the endorsement of Studebaker
quality and value by more than
145,000 motorists a sufficient
reason why you should see and
compare Studebaker cars before
you buy? Studebaker’s 72-year-
old reputation stands back of the
13 Studebaker models, all of
which are powered by quality-
built six-cylinder engines.

You do not realize what you lose by
cloudy teeth. This will show you.
It has brought to millions prettier
teeth. You see them daily. Decide
what prettier, cleaner teeth would
mean to you and yours.
You must combat film
The teeth's great enemy is that vis-
cous film you feel. It clings, despite
old brushing methods. It becomes
discolored, dingy. Teeth lose lustre.
Film holds food substance which
forms acid. The acid causes teeth to
A Beauty Critic
says —
Next to lovely eyes, the greatest beauty item is

decay. Germs breed by
millions in it. They, with
tartar, cause pyorrhea.
Tooth troubles were in-
creasing. Beautiful teeth
were seen less often than
now. Few escaped.
The fight on film
Then dental science
sought to fight film. Two
ways were discovered.
One removes it without
harmful scouring.
Protect the
Enamel
Pcpsodent disin-
tegrates the film,
then removes it
with an agent far
softer than enamel.
Never use a film
combatant which
contains harsh grit.
Able authorities proved these met-
hods effective. They mean a new dental
era. A new-type tooth paste applies
these methods daily. The name is
Pepsodent.
Now careful people of some 50
nations employ it. And prettier teeth
everywhere show the results.
Why old ways failed
Old ways brought undesired results.
Pepsodent brings the opposite. It
multiplies alkalinity of saliva, to neu-
tralize mouth acids. It multiplies the
power of saliva to digest
starch.
The combided results
will amaze you. Now
learn what they mean.

“Pulganbar”: “P.P.’s” par. (B. l/5/’24)
re £3OOO being realised for a collection of
“Sydney Harbor View” postage stamps of
less than 30 years ago is misleading. The
stamps sold were actually the rare first issue
(1850) “Sydney” views. “Harbor” views
are practically worthless.
“Centurion” : N.S.W. Minister for Justice
Ley has issued a warning to grocers and
others against the sale of “medicinal wines”
during prohibited hours. The game has had
a long run, and been a profitable line with
many suburban chemists, especially on Sun-
day evenings, when the bite of Saturday
night’s dog cries aloud for a hair.
“Tauwarra”: There is a “signed-on”
native in the Port Moresby district who
answers to the name of Bluestone. His
boss called him over one day and said, “This
name altogether boy sing out he proper name
b’long you?” “No, sir,” answered the lad,
languidly; “my Christian name is Living-
stone —L-i-v-i-n-g-s-t-o-n-e.” He was a
graduate of a mission school.
“Wessel”: The extent to which the lash
was used in N.S.W. even in the later days
of the “system” is shown by a return made
up in 1838 and quoted in the latest volume
of the Historical Records. This gives the
details for the years 1830 to 1837 inclusive.
The record is held by 1825, when 7103 con-
victs received 332,810 lashes, or an average
of 46 each. The most fruitful cause was
neglect or idleness, 72,659. Absconding
came next with 50,737. The returns include
punishment at Norfolk Island and Moreton
Bay, which no doubt hit up the average con-
siderably.
“Uramao”: Captain Ellis, head of
Maoriland’s Forestry Department, insists
that the Dominion’s “forest sense” is much
more in evidence than that of Australia.
In the Quaky Isles, he is convinced, more
eucalyptus-trees are planted and propagated
than in the whole of the Commonwealth, and
three times as many coniferous trees. And
things are getting better and better; apart
from the operations of the Forestry Depart-
ment, 12 trees are planted in M.L. privately
for every one that went in four years ago.
“Tin Hat” : Fresh testimony to Australian
“casualness” is provided by the annual re-
port of the Commonwealth P.M.G. During
the year ended last June 3,613,602 letters
found their way to the Dead Letter Office.
Of these 546,215 were destroyed, as neither
writers nor addressees could be traced. No
less than £142,116 was taken from letters
that were undeliverable: no fewer than
19,885 persons posted letters without bother-
ing to address the envelopes, and 348 of the
unaddressed envelopes contained £2075.
“Billo C.” : There are other ways of hav-
ing one “for the good of the house” than by
swallowing the liquor. We pulled up at a
little roadside pub in the Hills (S.A.), and
my friend Peters, not wanting a drink,
strolled into the bright little flower-garden
alongside, where he saw some very fine
geraniums. He asked Mrs. Publichouse
how she raised such fine blooms. “It’s my
secret, but I don’t mind telling you,” she
said—“l pour any stale beer we have on
them.’’ Peters rose to the occasion. “Well,
I don’t want a drink myself, ma’am, but
I’ll stand a pint for your plants. Divide it
between ’em with my compliments.”
“Peter Whiffle”: The one slip I detect in
“C.B.L.’s” account of the death of the Ger-
man “ace” Yon Richthofen is that the date
is placed a year too early. In April, 1917,
the Australians were somewhere around
Bullecourt, miles from the Somme. And
at that time Richthofen was only commenc-
ing to make a name for himself as an air-
fighter. In February, 1917, he had won no
more than 20 aerial victories, but by the end
of March, 1918, he had accounted for 80
opponents. After his 80th victory he was
decorated with the Prussian Order of the
Red Eagle. He was killed on April 21, 1918.
As a matter of fact there were two Richt-
hofens : the younger brother, also a German
flier, brought down the British airman Capt.
Ball, V.C., in May, 1917, about the same
time that the elder claimed Major Hawker,
another V. 0., as his victim.
“H.M'.” ; Another parson who has recently
renounced the old life is the Rev. John Gun-
ning, of St. John’s C. of E., Fremantle.
Before going, he took the opportunity of
telling his parishioners what he thought
about them. His two years in the parish
(out of his total of ten as a parson) have
been a period of continual conflict with
elders, who objected to his talking the truth
as he saw it. He now goes on the land,
and lie genially indicated that he hoped to
find his four-footed charges more Christian-
like than his ex-parishioners. A slightly
more forceful send-off was that which a
Sydney parson gave himself. “I prepared a
sermon for you to-night,” he said, “but I
tore it up; lam satisfied that its appeal
would be above your intelligence. I have
come to the conclusion that, if you don’t
know your own mean faults, you deserve more
pity than blame. I came to say ‘God will
damn you’; instead, knowing what you are,
I merely say ‘God help you.’ ”
“P.X.”; Britain is finding out, just as
N. S. Wales has done, that the more diffi-
cult the law makes things for the landlord
the scarcer new houses are. My friend
rented a dwelling in Surrey, and knew that
the landlord wanted to get him out to sell
it. It was in a small old village, and no new
places of the size had been built there for
years. But the landlord could not, under
the law*, disturb my friend without seeing
that he was provided with similar accommo-
dation elsewhere; and that was practically
impossible. So my friend sat down hard—
and presently, as he expected, got the place at
his own price. Now and then a desperate
landlord who is hard up for money takes
a chance and turns a tenant out on the
pretext that he wants the place for him-
self, and then sells it. A landlord who did
that was mentioned in a cable the other
day; it was at Leigh, and he was ordered
to restore possession to the evicted tenant
and pay £25 compensation plus costs —and
presumably make the best bargain he could
with the man to whom he had sold the pre-
mises. The law makes it easy for a family
which can produce the rent to stay in a
house once it can get possession; but it
makes house-building for tenants one of the
most unpopular pastimes in Britain, and the
Macdonald Government proposes to do some-
thing or other to make it still more so.

“Having: tried all sorts of oil

Rexona Soap incomparable as a
shampoo.”
Miss SYLVIA CLIFTON.
Your
Hair
Do you know that in

ant, and appears as soft,
lustrous and charming as
anyone could desire, after
a simple wash with Rexona
Soap.
A delightful surprise
awaits those whose hair
has been neglected, or is
scraggy, dry, brittle or
thin.
Rexona Soap cleanses the
hair of all dust, dirt or
excess oil, and in a few
moments you have doubled
the beauty of your hair.
Rexona Soap dissolves
every particle of dandruff,
cleanses, purifies and in-
vigorates the scalp, for ever
stopping itching and fall-
ing hair. If you care to
have pretty hair, and lots
of it, get a tablet of

Shampoo it with
REXONA SOAP
To shampoo or wash the hair with
Rexona Soap is an easy task, but the
results are startling. It leaves the
hair in such a beautiful condition, the
scalp perfectly clean and wholesome.
The hair becomes light and fluffy,
waving about the face in abundance,
as beautiful hair should always appear.
Rexona Soap leaves a delicate perfume,
invigorating the roots of the hair,
which prevents greyness. A few sham-
poos with Rexona Soap effectively re-
moves every trace of dandruff or loose
and falling hair. Ladies who use

is far better than any of the so-called
hair tonics.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DEEP in the world
A pit was made,
Where we were hurled ;
And there we stayed.
We lacked not food
Nor water there ;
Our tasks, though crude,
Kept off despair.
One point of light
Hropped its deep ray
To make with night
Alternate day.
“A star is there —
Look up,” I said.
They had no care
But to be fed.
I clambered high.
A dungeon-gate
Trellised the sky;
I would not wait.
Bar after bar
I wrenched away.
I saw no star,
For it was day.
N. TERRITORY,
FREDERICK T. MACARTNEY.
Shastra.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
u | IFLING the grave of 20 years ago.”
The reply was given to an in-
quiry by Stoddart, lounging in the
amplitude of a saddle-back drawn before the
winter fire. He gave a side-glance to a litter
of paper on the floor.
“Odd, Strachan, that this very day I have
been doing much the same thing. I’m leav-
ing the old chambers after, let me see, about
25 years. It’s ripping out a bit of one’s
life—dusty, dingy, worn-out old hole; reeks
of forgotten crimes; ought to be haunted.”
He tossed the fag of a cigarette into the
coals. “Give me one of those Turkish
smokes of yours. Still stick to ’em, I see.”
“Yes,” and Strachan passed the box.
“One ought to have a periodical burn-up
—say, once a year at least. Rummaging
among the bones of years ago doesn’t, as a
rule, add to the gaiety of life.”
“Joys you can’t get back, and pains that
still survive, eh?”
“Glad to see some strain of sentiment in
a bachelor. But I suppose you chaps have,
tucked away in your memories, little romances
as sacred as the bread-and-butter loves of the
old maid or the discontented wife?”
Strachan shrugged his shoulders. “Maybe.”
“Well, we don’t want a supper of senti-
mental slops. By the way, I came across
an old brief among my lumber that called
you to mind. Before it came to me you had
returned it. Hands too full, I suppose. It
was the case of that man Crosby —caused
some interest at the time.”
“Yes, I remember it. I was getting out of
criminal work; didn’t see it led to anything
—except the notoriety of the evening press.”
“You’re right. It doesn’t, as a rule. Cer-
tainly doesn’t lead in a bee-line to the
Supreme Court Bench. It was that case and
some others settled my fate. Now I couldn’t
get out if I tried.”
“The little success that means a rut. Yes,
I remember it.”
“Naturally, we both would. We met the
woman in the case at dear old Sally Ben-
son’s monthly symposium—salon, meeting of
souls, or whatever she called it. Met all
sorts of cranks there, and a bunch of pretty
girls, most of ’em married or dead now-
much the same to us. What was her Chris-
tian name —remember?”
“Shastra.”
“Ah, yes. I remember ‘Hamilton,’ but
couldn’t think of the other* Rather odd
name—Shastra Hamilton. She was a very
bright girl in Sally’s day. I never could
understand why she married Crosby.”
“Money, I suppose.”
“Not altogether. He was an architect,
and there are not many fortunes made out
of architecture in this part of the world.
Do you know, Strachan, I never got to the
bottom of that affair. I got him off the
murder charge, but with 10 years for man-
slaughter—pretty stiff. The poor devil only
did six of them and died. Sally Benson
told me some years ago that the wife lived
a year only after the trial —phthisis, or
something of that kind. Of course the affair
did for her socially. Sally said she died
without a friend to say good-bye to her.”
Strachan had risen to get a match from
the mantelpiece. “I wouldn’t take as gospel
all that Miss Benson says. Probably it was
just gossip she had heard, and ‘gossip’ is
frequently a euphemism for ‘lies.’ ”
“At all events she died leaving something
unsaid—something I would have liked to
have heard.”
“Did it affect the case?”
“Not materially. Perhaps you have for-
gotten the facts. After 20 years I had
only a vague memory of them myself, until
the old brief revived them.”
“Twenty years—yes, it is a long time; a
long time to keep remembering.”
“You may recall Crosby. He was a quick,
alert man, clever at his profession, but sub-
ject to bursts of passion that seemed to
serve as emotional escape-valves, jealous and
impulsive. There were no children of the
marriage, and one way and another their
domestic life did not run very smoothly.
Then came the affair. Crosby’s profession
often called him out of town—to the Moun-
tains, Newcastle and so on. One evening,
returning late, he found his wife absent.
She was paying a call, so the maid said.
They shared the same bedroom, and being
tired after the journey he did not wait up,
but went to bed. Crosby was not a smoker;
in fact, heartily condemned smoking. Prowl-
ing about the room he came across a cigar-
ette-butt in one of those little glass con-
cerns women have on their dressing-tables.
On his wife’s return he showed it to her
and _ asked for an explanation. According
to him, she hesitated, and then put up what
he called a ‘dignity bluff,’ but at last con-
fessed that she herself was the smoker, and
pleaded the loneliness of her life. He said
the practice must stop; and there, on the
surface, at least, the matter dropped.
“Crosby was absorbed in his work; not
actively cruel to her, but passively negligent.
Petty though the incident was, it roused
Crosby’s suspicions, touched his jealousy.
Though he accepted the explanation it did
not satisfy him. Nothing ever does satisfy
jealousy. Another incident, exceedingly
small, but fuel to his mind, happened later
on. He found among his handkerchiefs, re-
turned from the laundry, one bearing the
initial ‘S.’ Of course, the only explanation
offered was ‘a mistake at the laundry.’ How-
ever, it increased his suspicion. Crosby, as
I know, with all his temperamental defects,
was a gentleman. He did not employ a
private detective or anything of that kind.
He had indeed a rather exaggerated sense
of personal honor —a little out of date in
these days of cash compensations. He pur-
chased a pocket revolver. One afternoon,
about 5 o’clock, he returned to his home
unexpectedly. He had been up-country to
inspect a job, and had fixed the time of
his return for the following evening. Enter-
ing the house with his latchkey—it was
an old-fashioned house, two-storeyed, with the
bedrooms on the upper floor —he saw from
the hall a man, a stranger, coming down
the stairs. He was followed by Mrs. Crosby.
You can realise what followed with an impul-
sive, passionate man such as he. He drew
the revolver he was carrying and fired point-
blank at this man; who died subsequently
at the hospital without regaining conscious-
ness. ‘Heath sealed his lips,’ as they say
at the Cinema.
“I defended Crosby, as you know; not
that I could hope for an acquittal, but on
the chance of reducing the charge to man-
slaughter. Apart from the bits of circum-
stantial evidence, there was Crosby’s own
admission. After killing the man he walked
straight out of the house to the nearest
police-station and gave himself up. He said,
‘l’ve killed a man at my house, and I’d kill
him again under the same circumstances’—
or something of the sort.
“After reading the brief I wrote asking
the wife to see me at my chambers. She
did so. The meeting was a bit awkward,
remembering the earlier days, when we had
met frequently at the Bensons’ house, but
she carried it off very well. I told her the
position. It might possibly help me in my
effort for him if I knew, more exactly, how
matters stood—this, of course, in confidence.
Then she told me her story, confining herself
to bare details. I am convinced there was
something behind her story, but I couldn’t
press for it. In effect she said this. Some
ten years earlier a younger brother—he and
she were the survivors of the family, at least
on this side of the water—had shipped for
Westralia, under an assumed name, and had
been lost to her. He was a bit of a rip,
so I understood, and left here under a cloud.
A few days before the murder she received a
letter from him, stating that he was in Syd-
ney and wished to see her. She replied fixing
4 o’clock the next afternoon. He came. It was
the usual sort of errand with that kind of
man—money. Crosby always gave her a
fair personal allowance, and, like women,
she kept a good deal of loose cash about the
place. The meeting with this lost brother
seemed to have affected her deeply. They
went upstairs to see some photos and some
little articles from the old home, treasured
in her bedroom. He got money, as much as
she could give, and they were returning to
the lower part of the house when on the
stairway Crosby met them.”
■ “What happened to her?”
“Nothing, so far as Crosby was concerned.
She said the shock dazed her and she fell.
When the police reached the house they
found her unconscious on the stairs, near the
murdered man. It was a plausible but not
wholly convincing story.”
“But you believed it?”
“Not altogether at the time, but I accepted
it. I advised my man to plead not guilty.
For the prosecution there was his own ad-
mission—a damning admission —and the
usual police evidence as to the revolver, the
empty chamber, the bullet fitting it, and so
on. All I could do for the defence was to
make a fight for manslaughter. I put Crosby
in the box —after his admission no further
harm could result to him—and I hoped some
possible good might come of it. He said the
man was a perfect stranger to him, but for
the moment he ‘saw 7 red.’ I remember the
phrase, and I think it told with the jury—
summed up the passionate, impetuous nature
of the man. I produced the cigarette-end
he had found and kept with jealous care,
and he gave the approximate date of its find-
ing, which I showed from the ship’s list of
passengers, the wife having given me the
assumed name, was some time prior to the
prisoner’s arrival. This all went to show
that the act was not, at all events, a deliber-
ate intention to kill a particular man known
to the prisoner. I admit the defence was
weak; but, despite the Judge’s summing up,
I succeeded in impressing the jury—usually,
where the death penalty is involved, inclined
to mercy if a loophole is offered.”
“Of course you agreed with that finding?”
“Yes, I believe she told me the truth, so
far as the confidence went. The improbable
is sometimes the truth. But lam sure there
was something behind that she did not tell
me. At that time I suspected—to-day I am
sure —Crosby killed the wrong man.”
“So you believe there was another man?”
“I do.”
“Hid you get any clue to his identity?”
“I never sought it, Straclian. What really
held me was what one might call the
psychological interest: the mind of a man
who knew another had been done to death
for something of which he, the true offender,
had been guilty.”
A brief silence between the men was broken
by the chiming of a clock.
“Eleven ! I must be going. Family men
can’t see the dawn in, old man. Nice
whisky this —there, there, just a finger. I’ll
take another of your smokes. By the way,
the fellow smoked Turkish. I tested the
butt I spoke of—a bit of Sherlock Holmes—
and it was Turkish all right. Now I must
be off. Good night!”
Stoddart was soon home, in bed, and lost
in sleep.
Strachan sat over the remains of the fire.
He might have been sleeping, so immobile
the figure. Suddenly he leant over and put
some sheets of flimsy paper on the embers.
They caught; there was a momentary blaze,
and in the corner of a written page, that
writhed and twisted in the flame, stared
clear and large the word “Shastra.”

What causes
Aching Joints ?
Much of the pain attributed to rheumatism is
really due to an excess of uric acid in the blood
caused by weak kidneys.
When excess uric acid col-
lects in the blood it forms
Jagged crystals, which are de-
posited in the muscles, joints,
along the walls of the arteries,
and in the sheaths of nerves.
The movement of a nerve or
muscle that contains these uric-
acid crystals causes sharp, in-
tense, darting pains, and in time
starts welling and inflammation
of the joints.
The moment you feel any
rheumatic pains—any twinges
or uneasiness in the back—any
sign of urinary irregularity, be-
gin with Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills. This medicine aids
the kidneys to filter excess uric
acid out of the blood, and has
been winning successes for over
fifty years.
WELL-KNOWN SYDNEY
MAN CURED.
Mr. A. B. Cowell, Sutherland Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says : —“Some months
ago I was suddenly seized with a ter-
rific pain across my back, just above
the kidneys. It did not go away, as I
thought at first it would, but, on the con-
trary, it got worse, and . I was soon so
bad that I was bent almost double. I
was completely crippled, and even at
night I got very little rest from the
constant pain. I could not turn over
without suffering acutely, in fact no
position was comfortable for long. My
secretions were affected, being thick and
cloudy with a red sediment. I tried
different remedies, but they gave me no
relief whatever. One day a friend sug-
gested I should take Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and it proved to be good
advice, too, for three bottles cured me
completely, driving the pain out of my
back, regulating the secretions and
banishing every other distressing symp-
tom of kidney disorder. I feel splendid
now, and my recovery is due solely to
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”

Backache Kidney’ Pills.
TWO RESIDENTS OF SYDNEY CURED OF
PILES BY DOAN’S OINTMENT*
A GLEBE CASE. , A BEACONSFIELD CASE.
Mr. J. Mitchell, 26 Campbell Street,
Glebe, Sydney, says:—“l was a sufferer
with Itching Piles for years, and I can-
not describe the agony of this. ailment.
Scores of times I have lost my rest,
sleep being out of the question. I used
a great many Pile remedies, and was
treated by a doctor, but got no relief.
Reading of cures effected by Doan’s
Ointment, I decided to try it. A few
applications gave me ease, and by con-
tinuing the treatment I found, to my
great satisfaction, that all the pain and
irritation had gone. lam very grateful
to Doan’s Ointment for my cure, and
advise sufferers to try this remedy, and
am satisfied that if they follow the direc-
tions they will be cured, as I was.”
Ten years later Mrs. Mitchell says:—
“My husband has been free from itching
piles since Doan’s Ointment cured him,
but he still uses this remedy now and
then, just as a preventive against any
return of his old complaint.”
Mr. James Higgins, Queen Street,
Beaconsfield, Sydney, says:—“Some
years ago I suffered a lot from Itching
Piles, the irritation being very trying,
particularly so at night and during the
hot weather. A friend advised me to
use Doan’s Ointment, and, knowing how
good Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
were, I got a pot at once and it proved
a blessing. After a few applications I
got relief, and, as I continued with the
treatment, the improvement was main-
tained, until finally the Piles completely
disappeared. Five years have elapsed
since I used Doan’s Ointment, and I
have had no return of the ailment all
that time. I cannot speak too highly of
this remedy, and recommend it to other
sufferers.”
Six years later Mr. Higgins says:—“l
am still free of the torture of Piles, and
have been since Doan’s Ointment cured
me eleven years ago.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS the ear bumped along the bush
road, the young man who was driv-
ing it looked around on familiar
scenes. The countryside had changed less
in ten years than a suburban street
might have in as many months. The line of
the hills on the far horizon with the heat
mist before them, the scrub, broken here and
there by cultivated patches, the steely blue
of the hot sky with its few wispy clouds
passing dreamily, the hum of the locusts —
all were things of to-day, as of ten years
ago.
The driver stopped his car suddenly,
stood up and waved his arms, shouting.
Afar off a man, working in a field, straight-
ened at the hail, and stared. The other
drove on again, laughing to himself. The
manner of his home-coming appealed to his
dramatic sense.
A few minutes later he was crawling
through the uproar of a disturbed yard
towards a rambling weatherboard cottage.
A black dog had come to meet him furiously,
and then sidled away, still barking, with
a tail which had changed from a vigorous
interrogation mark to a sign of astonish-
ment.
The uproar brought an elderly woman
and a girl into the sunlight. The young
man jumped to the ground, strode forward,
and paused a few feet from them.
“Mother!” he said, his hands out.
“Jack! Jack! Oh, my Jack! My Jack!”
she cried, and in a moment her arms were
around his neck and she was kissing him
ecstatically, while she poured forth ques-
tions and exclamations. Why had he not
written? Where had he been all these
years? What a fine man he had grown!
She had known he would come back all
along!
“Give me time, Mother,” he laughed
softly : “I’ll tell you all about it when I
get time.”
Gently disengaging himself he turned to
the girl, who was looking at him in shy
wonder. She had been a long-limbed school-
girl, with a difficulty in keeping her stock-
ings straight, and an infinite capacity for
wearing holes in them, when he had seen her
last. Now
“It’s Mary!” he exclaimed. “I’d hardly
have known you. You’re a regular wood-
land Venus!”
“And too old to have my hair pulled,”
she laughed, holding out her hand. He
held it lingeringly for a moment and then
turned towards the car.
“I’ve some parcels here,” he said. “I’ll
take them inside. I want you to have a
look at what’s in this one. I’ll open it, if
you get me a hammer; and you can be see-
ing whether you like it whilst I get the
rest.”
He opened the case and returned to the
car to find the worker in the field, at whom
lie had waved, gazing at it in bewilderment.
Because they were so alike the two pre-
sented a strange contrast; the one with
bare arms sunburnt and knotted, hard hands,
lanky, slouching figure and tanned face;
the other with dapper figure and smooth
white skin. The countryman stared.
“Prank!” cried Jack. “Don’t you know
me?”
Prank’s face lit up, and he grasped his
brother’s two hands in a fervent grip. But
all he said was “Y’ come back!” And then
he looked again at the car.
“Belong to you?” he said. “Gripes, y’
must be doing well.”
The mother came rushing out, and, hav-
ing kissed Prank in sheer happiness, kissed
Jack again, raptui’ously.
“Isn’t it wonderful to have him again,
Frank, dear!” she cried. “And I want you
to see what he’s brought me —a tea-set: a
lovely tea-set, such as I’ve wanted all my
life !”
Prank helped to carry the parcels into
the homely kitchen, now a litter of wood and
straw, and was made to admire the dainty
china, about which all he could say, as he
handled a cup awkwardly, was “Brittle
things! Break damn easily!” The mother
felt that she must make tea at once, to
“christen” the cups, and did so, while Mary
continued the unpacking.
“There’s a new plough and saddle at
the station,” said the newcomer. “I thought
you’d like them. Prank.”
“Yairs, thanks,” said Frank. “Cripes,
you must have spent some money!”
“And what on earth’s this?” cried Mary.
Jack flushed and laughed awkwardly, as she
unwrapped a big parcel and revealed—a
doll.
“Who’s it for?” she inquired.
“Well, you see,” he explained, “always
when I thought of you I thought of a little
girl who’d make dolls of nearly any old
thing. You see, I used to forget about how
the time had passed; and I suppose I was
so excited with the idea of coming back
Anyway, dolls got in my mind, and I bought
one!”
The girl’s face flushed with delight. “How
I would have loved that doll when I was
smaller!” she breathed. “But I’ll keep it
now—for the thought.”
Prank, who had been sitting on the edge
of the table, rose suddenly and walked to
the door.
“I’ve somethin’ to do. I’ll be back in a
bit,” he said, and was gone.
* * * *
The news of the prodigal’s return stirred
Bullendoo during the next week. When he
had fled as a boy the neighbors had denounced
his defection. So there was intense pride
in the family over his motor-car, his marks
of city culture and his shower of presents.
In what seemed like the ending of a fairy
story he had justified himself. The men
trooped along to have a look at the boy
they had condemned, and some of the matrons
found themselves wishing for a prodigal son
of their own. Daily Jack drove his mother
and Mary—the girl who, left an orphan, had
been adopted in the warm-hearted country
fashion by Mrs. MOrby, and was now to her
quite as much as a daughter of her own
might have been—to visit friends. Proud
visits these. Passing neighbors would pull
up sometimes when they saw Frank at
work, and open with remarks about the
weather or the crops.
“Yairs,” Frank would say. “Have you
see our Jack yet?”
So .Tack, who had not come back in rags,
but had brought his own fatted calf with
him, was invariably forgiven. He explained
the reason for his long silence: he had gone
away with the idea that he could make
money and help the farm along, and he felt
that until he had made money he had not
justified his act in leaving all the work and
the struggle to Frank. He wanted to make
good first.
“Jack always was a swank,” smiled Mary
with a reminiscent laugh. “Don’t you remem-
ber? If he couldn’t do things he liked to
pretend that he didn’t want to. If he didn’t
have things he’d say he didn’t want them.
He was flash.”
“You didn’t ought to say that,” reproved
Mrs. Morby. But the remark passed in
the eagerness of the home circle to hear
more. It seemed he had been doing “agency
work.” And now he was thinking of coming'
back to the farm. He was disposed to pay
off the bank, and settle down in the country
for good. That is, of course, if Frank was
willing. He had made the place, and it was
for him to say.
“We’ll talk it over,” said Frank, and re-
lapsed into silence, staring at the lamp.
Somehow the matter was never talked
over; and Frank continued to toil day-long
in the field, while Jack stayed on as a guest.
Quite frequently Mrs. Morby had work at
home; and Mary drove off with Jack, while
the old lady smiled in placid content.
The neighbors were sorry in a way: sorry
for Frank, or perhaps for an old illusion.
For though Frank had shown no love-making
propensities it had been accepted in the dis-
trict that he and Mary would marry some day.
Now, of course, it was different. Although
old heads might shake doubtfully when they
remembered the feckless youth who ran away
leaving his brother a double share of work
and his mother to her sorrow, it was plain
to all that this affluent city-mannered man
must have a greater appeal than the shy
farmer, with his hardened hands and heavy
toil-tried spirit. Anyway, Frank didn’t seem
to care.
He didn’t seem to care. Yet sometimes
when he was alone he would stop work, and
with sullen rage in his face his clenched
fist would go towards Heaven.
One day old Dawson caught him repair-
ing a smashed fence.
“There’ll be a weddin’ your way soon, T
expect,” he said with a broad wink and a
jerk of the whip towards the house. “I seen
them out together this morning.”
“Yairs.”
“When is it to be?”
But Frank had turned once more to the
fence.
That evening he caught Jack on the veran-
dah. He sat beside him heavily, silently;
filled his pipe, and lighted up. Then he said
suddenly:
“Say, Jack, if I was to leave, do you think
you could keep things going?”
Jack stared. “What’s the idea?”
“I was thinking of knocking around a bit
—seeing the world.”
“Following my example?” suggested the
other, with a laugh.
“Not exactly—the city would be no good
to me. I’d fancy goin’ drovin’ for a while.
Of course, half of the farm’s yours any time
want it; but you could have the lot, if
you’ll only look after the old lady, and carry
on. You can make things square with the
bank”-
“I was thinking of giving Mary the
amount of that for a wedding present,”
laughed Jack.
Frank’s voice was desperate.
“That’s just it; I see the way things are
going, and I can’t stand it. I’ve tried to,
but I can’t. Don’t think I’m complainin’;
but sometimes I feel as if it’s not fair. I’ve
had to graft hard; an’, with it all, I’ve not
been able to do wliat you can, or give what
you can—either to mother or to Mary. There
was that tea-set; I’d have liked to give ’er
that, knowin’ what it meant, but —well, I
couldn’t. And about Mary”
“Do you care for her?”
“Care for her? I love her that much I
feel that I have to go away from her—now.
Don’t think I’m grudging you. I only want
her to be happy ; but all the time —for years
—l’ve been telling myself that when I got
the place clear I’d marry her. And now
I understand: when there’s a man like you
and a man like me, why”
“Good God, man,” cried the other; “why
didn’t you ask her? I asked her the third
day I was here. It doesn’t matter what she
said, but I know wdiat some people might
say when there’s a man like you and a man
like me; that those hands of yours, which
you hold out as if you think them dead
weight against you, were spoiled by work
which I dodged, and that everything I have
I owe to letting you spoil them.”
“Yes; I would say that.”
It was Mary’s voice, and she stood beside
Frank, her hand caressing his arm.
He was dazed, but with a dim understand-
ing took her hand in his, clasping it.
“Mary and I have been good friends,”
laughed Jack, “but that’s the sort of thing
she’s been _ as good as saying to me ever
since I tried to make love to her—while
she was waiting for you to get jealous enough
to tell her you wanted her, you silly ass!
Here’s the cheque for that wedding present.”
“But you, Jack— you?” said Frank, help-
lessly.
“Oh, a trifle like that won’t hurt me,”
said Jack loftily. “But it reminds me that
I’ll have to get back to Sydney to look after
my business. You might as well keep
the car, too; I’ll be buying another one.”
* * * *
It was a few days later that Jack settled
down in an empty railway carriage, brought
out his cheque-book, and made a pencilled
calculation in the back.
“Five pounds six and fourpence,” he
mused. “She said I was a swank, and I’ve
certainly swanked well on that Tatt.’s prize.
Anyway, old Softgoods will be glad to have
me back again.”
“And she said, too,” he ruminated, “that
if I couldn’t have a thing I said I didn’t
want it. True enough! A swank like my-
self couldn’t keep a wife on a counter-
jumper’s screw and a start of five quid.”
