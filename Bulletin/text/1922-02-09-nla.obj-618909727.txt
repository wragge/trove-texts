The Res Page
England's Tramp Poet
Part of the charm of the personality of
William H. Davies, as of Ins poetry and
prose, is his naive egoism, Not the egoism
of the self-conscious, over-cultivated literary-
artist : that is a horrible thing, and of it
Davies has not a trace. lie is not a more singer
of songs, but a man who scales the heights
and plumbs the depths. To him there is
nothing impure or commonplace; he has
sought the face of Beauty, but has not
turned away from the pageant of human life
with all its dark and evil shades, experienc-
ing to the full in his own person “the slings
and arrows of outrageous Fortune.” His
themes are the old themes: Love of Nature,
the swift coming of Death, the power of Love,
and men at battle with Fate. Yet out of
these elemental themes he creates a new
beauty, sings of these old things in a new
way, reclothes the old imagery with a new
dress.
file is the eternal child, the Peter Pan
of Literature. If he has any forbears in
poetry it is with the lusty songsters of the
age of Elizabeth that he may claim kinship,
men who wrote their poetry from out of the
heart of life. Many of his poems coqld be
read without surprise in any volume of the
great poets of the seventeenth century.
. His longer poems are a comparative fail-
ure. They are of interest by reason of their
touches of autobiography ; otherwise they in
no wise surpass the verse of many a lesser
pbet now writing. His genius is shown as
a- lyric poet: poems not written in a study
of* drawing-room in violet ink with a quill
pen, but songs of the open air, with the scent
qij the fields about them. No modern has
sung of Love with the same intensity:
A thousand trees to every house,
‘ | A singing bird in every tree ;
f , And in the midst of these she dwells,
, And lives for me—doth Margery ;
; | Where we can take our sweet love’s fill
j Shut in a garden green and still.
The same lyric passion is to be found in
hjs poems of childhood, fragrant with that
ujagic of the child outlook, when hours pass
in joy and all life seems one golden song:—
. f saw this day sweet flowers grow thick—
j But not one like the child did pick.
1 heard this day bird after bird—
But not one like the child has heard.
A hundred butterflies saw I
But not one like the child saw fly.
My world this day has lovely been —
1 But not like that the child has seen.
In many of his poems he is able to supply
a touch of vivid realism which springs out of
the heart of his experiences of life. This
quality is shown in his poem “The Bird of
Paradise,” which gave the title to the volume
of 1914, and is included in the collected poems.
He came from life to poetry, not from poetry
to life.. -His youth and early manhood were
Spent “hemmed in by wrecks of men,” in
cbiiiinon lodging-houses, with beggars on the
wayside. He lacked that rigorous training
which in more respectable circles aims at
the suppression of emotion, and the substi-
tution of a polite boredom. He was there-'
fore able quite naturally to give free scope
to his delight in simple things, and, being a
poet, when the time came, to utter hi.s
eipotions with such power that the world
began to heed, and then *to praise. It is
life, not books that speaks. That is why
many of his lyrics fill, us with .such delight:
j The squirrel flies before the storm
He makes himself in leafy trees.
Young gossamer is in the field ; „
He holds the flowers with silver lino—•
They nod their heads as horses should,
And there are forty dappled kine
As fat as snails in deep, dark wells,
And just as shiny, too, as they,
Lie in a green field, motionless.
And every one now stares my way.
fti I must, become a starer too’:
! I stare at them as urchins can
When seamen talk, or any child
That sees by chance its first black man.
‘j . 1 stave at drops of rain that shine
Like glow-worms when the time is noon; .
I stare at little stars in Heaven,
j That try to stare like the big moon.
1,1 wonder what would have happened to
Davies if that, first little paper-covered
volume of his had riot fallen under the des-
qerning eyes of Bernard Shaw? With all
his power of heart and will he would
probably have fought a losing fight and gone
(jown unknown to an early grave to join that
army of men of letters who have known no
lieeognition. That he passed through bitter
waters we may gather not only from the
facts of his life as set forth in the Auto-
biography. but from many of his poems in
flic earlier books. Such a poern as “Hope
-Abandoned,” fioui “New Poems” (19071.
yoiees the despair of a man of genius caught
in the web of unrequited toil, feeling the
bitterness, and despair that is too often the
heritage of genius, Hcntlemen with large
incomes, sitting in comfortable club arm-
chairs, are apt, under the influence of ruined
digestions, to extol the blessings of poverty,

Fortunately none have Endeavored to pat-
ronise Mr. Davies. And no doubt it is be-
cause he knows what he knows that, while
the note of joy and wonder prevails when,
His thoughts are dancing flowers
And joyful singing birds.
lie has much, of that fine humnnitarianism
which often leads the sensitive mind to hours
of sad thought.
SAMUEL .T. LOOKER.
Shelley’s Epipsychidion
This is the, centenary year of Shelley’s
death. ' July 8, 1822. was the fatal day.
It is to be supposed that the Shelley memori-
alists have the event in mind and are getting
ready.. Many things: will be said that are
worth saying • many more, doubtless, that
arc not. As a rule, a lyric poem—especially
such lyrics as Shelley wrote —are only cheap-
ened by the attempt. to explain them, and by
the pedantic effort to point out what is to
spine people quite, obvious, and to others pot
intelligible at all. The need for eulogy of
Shojloy has gone by. Put there is just one
. poem—the Epipsychidion—over ; which you
may be allowed to break a lance, because in
addition to its supreme poetic quality it con-
tains the essence of a creed —a creed that
was a challenge when it was written, and is
a challenge now. It is the poem that gives
people who care nothing for beauty of
thought, and everything for conventional
values, an opportunity tp sneer. According
as you accept or reject the philosophy of it,
so must you stand with the sheep or with
the goats. And the goats, let it be acknow-
ledged, are the overwhelming majority.
Shelley wrote this poem at Pisa, iu Italy,
in the months of January and February, 1821.
By the end of June of the same year he had
written "Adonais.” This first half of 1821
was his most dazzling period. He was in
his 20th year and he had only another 12
months to live. Even in the “Prometheus
Unbound” you find occasional weak lines,
and turgid, only half-inspired passages; but
you find none of these defects, or anything
resembling a defect, in the Epipsychidion.
The thought is transcendental and the words
match the thought. The beauty of one is
the beauty of the other.
The poem expresses four moods or phases
of the lover’s mind. It. apostrophises the
loved object; then it justifies and explains the
nature of Love itself; then it tells in sym-
bolic language of the writer’s life-history and
his quest for what he has at last found;
finally, it strikes a note of rhapsody in which
spiritual ecstasy mingles with a longing that
is less of the earth earthy than of the stars
celestial. These four moods and phases fit
into one another and grow out of one
another, as do the movements in a Beethoven
symphony. But Shelley’s art is greater than
tiie musician’s because lie has no ivory chords
to play on ; only the words of common speech,
which in his verse become cloud-capped
towers and palaces reaching to the sky.
No woman was ever pictured quite as Shel-
ley pictured the ideal—and yet real —woman
of the Epipsychidion ; for Emilia Viviani was
quite real.’ Symbolism reaches 'its topmost
limit, and the symbols cannot be taken from
their context without marring the picture.
But I pass over this and over the third and
fourth movements, not staying to speculate
on the mysticism of the biographical part,
nor to question who was the one that “sat by
a well under blue nightshade bowers,” nor
yet who it was that was “true —ah, why not
true to me!” Neither Dowden nor Rossetti,
neither Symondsnov Jeafferson nor Oordy. has
explained what Shelley meant by these refer,
ences to his past life. Some of them are
clear enough, while others have baffled all the
commentators. It is only the lover’s credo
with which this article is concerned.
What Shelley says, in effect, is that the
love he feels for the woman he has married
is not detracted from by the new love with
which the lady in the convent has inspired
him! Both are real ; both are also ideal:
and one can be the complement of the other.
That is the statement divested of its lyric
quality and its poetical uplift. He .says to
the Lady Emilia
Thy wisdom ’ Speaks in me, and bids me dare
Beacon th’e rocks on which high hearts are wrecked.
He explains what the wisdom is. It is the
wisdom that separates the few from the
many ; the wisdom that makes the rarer and
more restless souls follow knowledge “jike a
sinking .star”’ even if they get nearly killed
in the search. It is the wisdom, in short,
that keeps men off
the beaten road,
Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps, tread
Who travel to their home among the dead.
With these “poor slaves” lie would never
travel; neither did he believe that the keys
of Truth were in the possession of those who
With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,
The dreariest and the longest journey go.
There was the jab that Bernard Shaw
delivered much later—to be applauded and
called a deuced clever fellow, whereas Shelley
was hounded out of the country. But Shelley,
spoke a. more ornate language than most
people could understand and thereby added
to his offence. At any rate, it was past a
joke, and a horrible outrage on the pro-
prieties, to speak of one’s lawfully wedded
wife as a “chained friend” and possibly “a
jealous foe.” No self-respecting public
could stand it. So the isolated poet twanged
his lyre harder: >
True love in this differs from gold and clay
That to divide is not to take away ;
Love is like understanding, that grows bright
Gazing- on many truths.
“Love is like understanding!” Bumble-
dom and Philistinism had never thought of
that; they had thought of it as something
quite different and much simpler. They
did hot believe—do not now believe—that you
can divide your love without diminishing
the quantity that the lawful spouse thinks
she is entitled to, and that the neighbors
(whatever their own practices may be)
know she is entitled to. Least of all could
they tolerate Shelley himself, or what
Shelley was trying to tell them, Yet he had
done his best to explain. He was married,
of course: married to a woman of rare
gifts, had been married and exiled witli
her for six years; he was not dissatisfied;
but he was young* and a poet, and beauty
both animate and inanimate was bound to
attract him. Had it been otherwise, he
could not have been what he was; could
not have written what'he wrote; could not
have, given the world the rare things he
had to give: could not have caught the
inspiration that sprang from his lips like
music; could not have written the Indian
Serenade, the lyrics to Jane Williams, and
a lot more. That was what he meant;
but they did not understand.
He wrote his love poem. A few copies,
not more than 100 in all, were, published
in his lifetime, but neither the reviewers
nor the public took any notice. It was
not until the “Poetical Works” were pub-
lished by Mrs. Shelley in 1880 that the
Epipsychidion attracted the notice of any
considerable body of readers./ In that year
the first clear notes of admiration began to
be heard, and they have been growing ever
since.. At. this time of day there, is no need
to speak of the surpassing beauty of the
poem itself. That is admitted—but the
admission goes no further. No more in

PINKETTES
FOR SICK HEADACHE
Most people suffer at regular
intervals from sick-headache. The
trouble is caused by accumulation
of poison in the digestive organs
and this poison produces nausea
and the headache follows.
These distressing attacks may
be avoided. Pinkettes are dainty
little sugar-coated ovals that act
so gently that they are the ideal
laxative to use in correcting a
tendency to sick headache. They
have no unpleasant effect to make
them objectionable to the extra-
sensitive s'ick-headache patient.
Old-fashioned harsh purgatives
will not do at all in such cases.

Out like a ribbon-bund unrolled;
And no sound lives, however bold,
Above the wires’ exultant, screaming;
And what was once a pond down there,
Seen through the air, the magic air,
Grows green—oh, green beyond all dreaming ’
And dropped away are earthly things,

Clad in bright attire.
Hucksters stood in square and mart,

Wandering Blood.
I am the child of the wind and the sea,
The sport of the long, straight rain;
And the wild, wet breeze from the roaring
south,
And the creaming tide in the harbor-mouth
Shall never call me in vain.
The East calls and the West calls,
From the skies that touch the plain;
And my feet are hot for the roads that take
The empurpled wastes where the rainbows
break,
Where the foxes bark and the wild birds
wake,
And the bracken browns on the hill.
Ho, ho, for the scud in the wintry morn;
Ho, ho, for the sleet and the clouds all torn!
Heigho, for the tempest’s thrill !
The rain calls and the wind calls,
And my feet are never still!
For my fathers came from over the sea,
And their wandering , blood runs red in me;
And as long as there's salt in the windy
South,
And the fresh tides cream in the harbor-
mouth,
As long as the sap sings sweet in the tree,
The wanderer's heart shall beat in me!
Deep in the womb of the blossoming earth
No grave could imprison me;
For I’d hear the drone of the sea-winds pass.
And I’d breathe the scent of the sun-warmed
grass.
And Death should set me free.
O green day, O glad day,
I should wake to bird and tree;
And I’d steal where the waves broke clear
and cold,
And shake out the dust from each white
grave-fold,
And untie my hair on those sands of gold
Where the pig-face trailed to the deep !
And, oh, none should know that the dead
ran wild
And danced with the bees on the cliffs gorse-
tiled,
And laughed on the windy steep !
The mad earth, the glad earth
Would never let me sleep!
For my fathers came from over the sea.
And their wandering blood runs red in me;
And as long as the ti-tree boughs are stripped,
And the magpie trolls in the eucalypt —
As long as the seagull calls from the sea,
The wanderer's heart will beat in me!

OUR RACIAL FAILING.
In the course of an address to his constitu-
ents last week, Speaker Levy, of N. S. Wales,
dealt with the question of “disloyalty”:
It was wickedly untrue to say that the Labor party
was a party of disloyalists. He did not think that
there was in Australia the amount of disloyalty that
some people seemed to imagine.
He drew his inspiration, apparently, from
some remarks about the workers made by
W. A. Holman at the Burns Anniversary
celebration :
Here we have men who claim their share in
tht government of the country in times of peace, but
who shrank in horror from the idea of fighting for
it in time of war. They accept all the privileges
and advantages of democracy they live in, and refuse
to shoulder its responsibilities.
Mr. Holman’s gibe was oddly out of place
in the circumstances. He is a Sydney bar-
rister, and many lusty young members of his
profession in N. S. Wales who, from their
past protestations on the subject of Empire
loyalty, might have been expected, when the
Flag called, to hasten to its assistance, de-
clined from first to last to do anything of the
sort. The industrial unionists number only
a shade over 10 per cent, of the population
of the Commonwealth. But about 60 per
cent, of the whole of the A.I.F. were union-
ists ; and many a nominal roll in the Field
showed a proportion as high as 80 per cent.
It is a truism, furthermore, that an immense
proportion of the most efficient fighting offi-
cers came of this very much over-rebuked
class. A fair idea of the number may be got
by glancing at a list of those present at a
Government House dinner or ball, and noting
the marked paucity of decorated men. Ex-
clude the Generals (seven-tenths of whom rose
by seniority), and the Staff men (who decor-
ated one another), and it will be found that
from, end to end of Australia not a score of
those Diggers whose names were household
words at the time the Empire was being
saved are in evidence when the great ones
of our country foregather. The vast
majority are working at some trade, or grow-
ing wheat, or droving cattle, while gentlemen
who preferred making money at home to risk-
ing life and limb in Flanders or Palestine
suggest that thev are disloyal to the Empire.
* * * *
The genesis of Mr. Holman’s rebuke, like
that of Mr. Levy’s protest against it, is in
a sense racial. The N. S. Wales Speaker
is a Jew, and the Jew is critical, derisive, and
intellectually an international. He may be
humbugged bv his own people, as his forebears
were by Moses ; but he will not take that
sort of thing from a Gentile. As he himself
explained to the celebrants round the Burns
statue, Mr. Holman, on the other hand, is
an Englishman bv birth; and the English
tradition always has been (except, as Kip-
ling noted, “when the guns begin to shoot”)
that the working-classes are more or less
what the first Duke of Wellington called
them—“disloyal and murdering scoundrels.”
In suggesting that Labor is disloyal, and that
somebody else—the modern prototypes pre-
sumably of the 19th century patriots who
“killed Kruger with their mouths” —won
the late war, Mr. Holman is in good com-
pany. Everyone is doing it. The underlying
spirit was put by Sir William Allardyce at
Melbourne last week. By way of valediction,
he said his mind on ,the churlish refusal of
Tasmania to raise his salary:—
“I cannot help thinking, despite what I have
heard from extremists from time to time, that at
the bottom of the hearts of the English-speaking
races there is a lingering trace of the old Feudalism
peculiar to the England of the early ages.
“The Radicals may deride those in more exalted
positions than themselves, but they have a sneaking
fancy to shake hands with them, all the same.”
Stephen McKenna expresses the same
complacent idea in his new book, “While I
Remember” :
And if faith is sometimes tried, faith in Public-
School education was justified in the years from
1914 to 1918. If it be granted hypothetically that
the war was won by England, and, further, that it
was won by soldiers in the field rather than by
Ministers, munition-makers, bankers and military
correspondents, it was won by the leadership of the
officers and by the fighting quality of the men ; and
the leaders were supplied first to the old army and
then to the new, for the first years of the war,
almost wholly by the Public Schools. When at the
end the net was thrown more widely, the quality of
the officers deteriorated: though they lacked nothing
of courage they could furnish no substitute for
something indefinable but recognisable—never so
quickly recognised as by the men they led —which
only a Public School provides.
Of course the best of the British officers who
went with the original 8.E.F., and with the
earlier drafts, were peerless leaders. But
the same could with equal truth be said of
the first French and German and Austrian
officers who were sacrificed. Their men fol-
lowed them, not because they were ex-Public
School boys, but because they were capable
soldiers. As the war dragged on, and the
glory began to go out of it, leaving only a
residue of sordidness and horror, a mani-
festation occurred which was continually
discussed in France during 1917 and 1918,
and which is adumbrated in the franker
post-war books 6f such men as Gibbs. The
feudal family type of Public School boy—
with the exception of a gallant handful, com-
posed of Grenfells, Lascelles and the
like —began to concentrate at Bases, Depots
and in Staffs. They might have done some
inimitable leading had they decided, like
Princess Mary’s future husband, to “stick
it out” ; but they did not. At every H.Q.
dozens of these exquisite young fellows were
to be seen busily and luxuriously doing
nothing in complete safety, while along the
stricken Bapaume-road, or up the corduroy
by Zillebeke, toiled Tommies and Diggers who
were in for it again after having been wounded
tw r o, three and even four times. Stephen
McKenna himself, who infers that some
martial ichor runs in the veins of his class
which is not shared by men such as Hector
MacDonald and Robertson, is shown on
the evidence of his own book to have been
in the early thirties when the war began,
to have played games at Oxford, to have
begun serving his country as a* temporary
schoolmaster at his old school (a job he left
after a year, “judging that period to be as
long as I could support the daily risk of
deliction by pupils or colleagues”), and to
have then settled “for the duration” in the
War Trade Department in, London.
It is not generally recognised by the
people who voice these challenging catch-
cries about “battles won on the playing-fields
of Eton,” the “disloyalty of the Laborites,”
the virtuousness of ourselves and the wicked-
ness of everybody else- —and in principle they
are all the same catch-cry—that they do
more to divide classes and even nations than
almost any other factor. It was cabled last
week that the French Government could not
endure Lord Curzon : he “had a particularly
rasping effect on French susceptibilities.”
He is, of course, the classic enibodiment of
British smugness. Rarely since the war has
he opened his mouth without putting his foot
in it. But there is no need to go to him
for examples of those disruptive forces,
national and social, which are more perilous
to-day than ever they were. The Fort-
nightly, in an article by Roland Grey on
the boys in Meredith’s novels, printed this:
The plain, ugly tale of the unclean, spy-haunted
Lycee is abhorrent to English readers. The Lycfie
is übiquitous in French memoirs and French novels,
and well may we thank Providence it is unknown
in ours, unless in “Sinister Street.”
Every Frenchman must appreciate the
imbecility of this proposition that because
no British novelist has touched frankly on
English Public School life it is impeccable,
as clearly as he will realise that there can-
not be much wrong with an institution
capable of turning out men of the solid
characters of Foch and Joffre. However,
this is not likely to prevent the Frenchman
from becoming contemptuously exasperated
with the writer of such cant, or from acquir-
ing, as a reaction, a vague dislike of the
whole race of Britishers. The great need
in Australia —as throughout the world —in
the coming years is peace: and, above all,
peace and goodwill between the classes. It
will never be achieved till public men aban-
don our racial trick of making smug general-
isations of an insulting nature. So. far as
individuals are concerned, the practice cer-
tainly does not pay. It is a rare thing to
find the worker who foams about the bowel-
less capitalist, or the .Tory who jeers at
working-men as anarchists, in a Ministry or
other high office. He is usually, like that
other Pharisaical manufacturer of trouble,
the professional sectarian, a discredited nui-
sance creating an uproar on the remote edge
of things. But though class abuse brings
little grist to the mill of the political agent
provocateur who deals in _ it, it certainly
helps his party by fomenting that hatred
which is the father of votes. So the issue
rests largely with the party leaders. They
could discredit, 'and eventually end, the
creation of class-and-class ill-feeling for the
permanent benefit of the country as easily
as they have fostered it hitherto in the imme-
diate interests of Office.
THE MISERY-MAKERS.
According to the newest Federal statistics
—which are not so close up to date
as might be wished —Queensland is the one
State where employment in factories is less
than it was in 1915, the year when Ryan
and Theodore took office. The figures are
only up to June, 1920, so they show N. S.
Wales as it was when the Dooleys took
office, and before the sickening crash which
their 44-hour antics and other doings brought
about at the end of 1921. Still, from one
point of view that makes them the more
valuable, for they show the difference be-
tween five then moderately sane Govern-
ments and the Mad Mystery at Brisbane:—
Employed in Factories.
1915. 1920. Increase.
N. S. Wales .. 116,611 144,454 27,843
Victoria .. .. 113,834 136,522 22,688
S. Australia .. 25,496 29,442 3,946
Tasmania . . .. 8,420 10,016 1,596
Westralia .. .. 14,631 15,409 778
Decrease.
Queensland .. .. 42,079 40,891 1,188
That isn’t much of a showing for the State
which the meddling, muddling adventurers
boasted of as a paradise. As to the number of
factories, in N. S. Wales, between 1915 and
the beginning of Dooley and McGirk,
the increase was 393; in Victoria, which
borrowed least and led the sanest life of the
crowd, the increase was 625 ; in S. Australia
it was 102; in Tasmania, 63; in Westralia,
37 ; in < iueensland, the richest State of all,
factories diminished by 21. In the matter of
wages, too, the Banana State had poor luck,
though the raising of pay is supposed to be
Theodore’s real specialty. At latest advices
the place paid to adult male factory-hands the
lowest average known on the mainland.
Tasmania lagged a little further behind ; but,
then, Tasmania never set up in the paradise
industry. The figures read :
Male Wages per Annum.
N. S. Wales £lBl 1 2 I Westralia . . £l6l 16 10
Victoria ..... 166 19 7 Queensland 151 1 10
S. Australia 162 8 7 I
The N.S.W. figures are for the time just
before the Dooley crash. They are different
now.
In Queensland to-day there is hardly a
metal mine at work, save a concern that the
Government keeps open as an advertisement,
charging the losses to the taxpayer, and little
partnership shows which take no notice of
wage and hour laws. Theodore, like
Dooley, first came to office on a promise
that wages would go up frequently but come
down never. So when it came to cost £9O
or even £99 to produce a ton of a staple
product whose selling price had dropped
to £67, the mines closed automatically.
The resulting catastrophe has been over-
whelming. The latest unemployment figures
are as follows, and in reading them it has to
be remembered that the Theodore curse began
in 1915 and the Dooley-blight in 1920: —
Unemployed per i'ooo Workers.
Dec., June, June,
1912. 1920. 1921.
Westralia .. 58 34 83
S. Australia .. 51 41 91
Victoria .. 67 56 98
Tasmania .. ' 34 24 103
N. S. Wales .. 50 55 135
Queensland .. 46 130 218
The trouble is everywhere, for it is im-
possible for two great States to do their
great drunk act without bringing loss on
their partners (S. Australian industries, for
example, are wholly dependent on N. S.
Wales for coal). But the real trouble began
coincidently with the coming of Theodore
and Dooley ; and it is vastly worse under
them tnan under anybody else.
Theodore the Impossible, the man w r ho is
just ahead of Dooley as a visitation of
Providence, because he has been inflicted
longer, inherited from his predecessor the one
railway system in the Commonwealth which
paid full interest and working expenses, and
also showed a profit. He muddled it into a
concern capable of losing £1,700,000 per
annum—capable of losing as much as all the
other State systems put together till Dooley
came along. The loss is nearly 50s. per in-
habitant per annum, which is more than it
costs to run the whole business of many a
well-managed nation. Yet the rates charged
are enormous—the highest in the Common-
wealth—comparing with those of Victoria
and with the Commonwealth average in this
wise:—
Highest-class Freights.
Average
Queensland. Victoria. All States.
50 miles .. 51/10 27/6 38/-
400 miles .. 254/1 169/9 200/4
Lowest-class Freights.
50 miles .. 5/8 3/- 3/9
400 miles .. 25/8 9/10 14/4
To make stupendous losses with such charges
as these is something of an achievement;
but Theodore, like Dooley, might be given
the treasury of Crcesus to loot without oppo-
sition, and he would make the working ex-
penses of the robbery exceed the plunder.
All this picturesque frenzy involves much
ground and lofty finance. Queensland bor-
rows in the United States, it being the only
State that rushed open-mouthed at the
Yankee usurer when he announced his desire
to “secure control of Australian finance.”
It would have rushed at the Devil with equal
avidity. Queensland borrows in England
when it can get monev; in Australia, with
a special eye to the South, its own people
being short; and from the Commonwealth.
It tried for another six or seven millions from
the Commonwealth the other day, to be
spent at its own discretion and without
audit, but the Federal Treasurer sniffed an
election, and hung fire. In one way and
another £10,500,000 was added to the debt
last year. Since the beginning of Theo-
dore in 1915 Queensland’s debt per head
has grown faster than that of any other
State (Dooley didn’t get off the mark till
1920.) The half-year’s deficit at the end of
1921 was about a million —but not for lack
of hard tax-collecting. Queensland does
amazing things in the way of extortion. The
figures are not quite up to date, but they
count for something:—
State (Peace) Taxation, per Head.
1916. 1917. 1918. 1919. 1920 1921.
Victoria .. 29/3 32/- 32/9 58/4 42/3
Westralia .. 25/8 26/1 29/1 40/2 50/11 67/4
Tasmania . . 38/3 43/11 52/6 53/2 56/3 66/10
S. Australia. . 31/11 33/8 46/7 53/2 59/5 65/2
N. S. Wales.. 33/4 39/1 41/1 42/4 49/7 70/4
Queensland . . 42/9 46/9 51/2 79/10 91/8 95/10
T'nere is nothing to show for the wonderful
Dooley and Theodore expenditure except
poverty, lack of work, jobbery, vulgarity,
violent language, accusations of graft, the
washing of dirty linen in public, salary
grabs and rows over schemes to secure a
fresh lease of power. The N. S. Wales
child-pensions haven’t begun to be paid, and
Queensland has no child-pension scheme, nor
any other scheme in particular. Nothing
exists to account for the situation except the
arrogance of a crowd which has the capacity
for getting into power—which capacity is
also the gift of the suburban beer-shop aider-
man—combined with an inability to make
any good use of authority when acquired.
Money melts in the presence of the Uooleys
and Theodores like snowballs in Hades, and
leaves as little trace. In the circumstances
Theodore’s opinion that Dooley (or pos-
sibly McGiRR) shows signs of becoming
worse than himself is interesting—very in-
teresting to the people who pay for Dooley’s
badness.
THE RETREAT TO LONDON.
Fihelly, the Queensland Treasurer, has
landed the steady job for which he has been
looking ever since the wind of adversity
began to blow on his Government. He is
going to the London office in succession to
Hunter, who is a sick man. It will be hard
for him to live for live years (the term of
his appointment) in the country he once
described as “the home of cant, humbug and
hypocrisy,” and nothing but the exalted
sense of duty which supports him in all
emergencies would have induced him to
make such a lingering sacrifice. However,
the rustle of the Bradburys will help to heal
the nurt that honor feels, for the salary
is ample. The young gentleman who is
auout to set out on his travels is a product
of the system, peculiar •to Australia, of
commissioning office-boys, wheelers and book
makers’’ clerks, simply because thev can
spout a bit, to run the country. In the
most favorable instances it takes ten years
for these fluent striplings to learn the busi-
ness of government (some of them never
learn it), and the process of educating
them is costly always. In Fihelly’s case
the expense has been horrible. He has been
successively in charge of the Railways and
the Treasury, and in each department he
has been a calamity. When his Government
took over from the Liberals Queensland
owed 52-J millions. When Fihelly steps
down the debt will be nearly 99 millions;
In one year (the last) he increased it by
£10,701,288, or about £l4 ss. per head of
population. And the only tangible results
of this stupendous outlay of foreign money
are a dismal collection of unpayable State
enterprises and a superfluous multitude of
Government employees. When Fihelly be-
came a railway manager, without any quali-
fications save enthusiasm and strong con-
victions about the loathsome capitalist,
the Queensland system was just about pay-
ing its way. The working expenses were
62.67 per cent, of the gross revenue, and
for every £lOO invested there was a net
return of £3 10s. sd. Within three years
the working expenses had leaped to 92.62 per
cent, of the gross revenue, and a whole 18s.
per cent, was available to meet an interest
charge of about 4 per cent. In five years
of Labor administration the railway deficit
soared to the dizzy altitude- of 64 millions,
and the Government confidently anticipates
that in the year now in progress this amount
will be swelled by two millions at least.
* * * ■ *
Proud of his share in making a payable
railway system insolvent, Fihelly removed
to the Treasury, satisfied that his forte was
finance. His experience in that Department
has left him with a still loftier opinion of his
own powers, and lest a thoughtless generation
should go in ignorance of them he recently
expounded his financial theories in an address
to the Brisbane branch of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation. Some of his ideas are
certainly dazzling. For example
We must have money for developmental work.
Our supply from England has been cut off. The
only way,*to my mind, that we can effectively deal
with the financing of young countries such as our
own is by the Commonwealth nationalisation of the
credit system, and we must have banking and insur-
ance controlled. With control of the banking and
insurance business our resources would be available
for the development of the State, for putting settlers
, on the land, for building homes for the workers, and
many other commendable activities could be gone on
with.
A hazy belief that the banks and insurance
companies are bursting with unused money
which could be commandeered and so ex-
pended that every “worker” in Australia
would have everything he wanted, is widely
prevalent in the party to which the Queens-
land Treasurer belongs. It is about the most
popular Labor superstition of the moment,
although the thing has been tried in Russia
with ghastly results. One can imagine how
the notion of borrowing everything in sight
would appeal to a financier like Fihelly,
but he gave no reason for the faith that was
in him. He didn’t explain what he meant
by “the Commonwealth nationalisation of
the credit system,” or indicate how it w r as to
be brought about. Instead, having conjured
up an airy vision of a nation made opulent
on “take and hold” principles, he straightway
demolished it:—
In regard to the American loan it is quite obvious
that it is much better for a borrowing country to
get the money from outside than by means of local
loans, because it leaves the surplus of the private
enterpriser available for reinvestment. We got the
money in America on very good terms.
The genius for finance on which the author
of these luminous observations prides him-
self is open to question. But in the noble
art of skittling one’s own arguments he is
without a peer.
3 * » >
Having developed his borrowing theories.
Fihelly bespoke the admiration of the Bris-


bane wharfies for his taxation policy. On
which subject he was unusually frank: —
It has been said that Queensland is the most heavily-
taxed State per head of population in the Common
wealth. But how many of you present pay tax*
lVhen you hear the complaints about the heavy tax
ation remember that it is not the working peopl*
who are taxed —our State is the only one where
the worker is not taxed. The major portion of oui
wealth goes to the South. Our taxes are heavy, but
heavy only on the big fellow, the one best able to
pay.
Hitherto the yarn has been that the
"workers” paid all the taxes and that the
other sections of the community simply
loafed on them in that respect. Now it is
vaunted that a Labor Government has
granted its supporters that general exemp-
tion from taxation which it has been the
aim of all privileged classes in all countries
and ages to secure and maintain. Such a
concession is a libel on democracy, but it is
only part of a general process of corrupting
those who vote the right way. They are
not to work if they prefer loafing, but if
they feel like work it is to be found for them
at Posterity’s expense. And all sorts of
burdens are to be laid on the capable and
enterprising to depress them to the level of
the shiftless and incompetent. It is a good
thing in moderation to help lame dogs over
stiles, but the Labor idea is that the nation
should make a monomania of the business,
accommodating its pace in all things to the
pace of the lame_ dog. It is easy to imagine
the kind of nation that would evolve from
this system of government, which has been
pursued so enthusiastically in Queensland
since 1915. But it isn’t Fihelly’s funeral.
He needn’t worry.
WIVES AND MOTHERS.
What is the matter with the woman of to-
day? In spite of the fact that she has at
last attained to the complete emancipation
so long clamored for, she generally fits no
better into the scheme of things than she
did before.
W omen have now equal rights with men in
practically everything—an equal voice in the
government of the country, equal advantages
of education in all branches of knowledge,
equal opportunities in most careers and pro-
fessions. They are even acquiring an equal
right to hang to a strap in a tram-car.
Superficially there still appears to be one
more concession to be made —the right to
propose. I say superficially, because every
woman knows that a man is a mere pawn in
this game. She has already decided what
the bridesmaids are to wear before he has
arrived at th.e stage of wondering if she would
be very upset if he were to kiss her.
The trouble, I fancy, is not with woman’s
life, but with her attitude towards it. She
is over-sexed. Her emotions are cultivated
at the expense of her reason. No matter
what paths she may set out to explore, love
is the only adventure, the only event, looked
for round every corner. The harp of life is
put into her hands, but she can only play
upon the one string. I hesitate to drag in
those hackneyed lines of Byron’s, but they
are so wretchedly true :
Man’s love is of man’s life a thing apart.
’Tis woman’s whole existence.
Yet her very absorption in the one idea
eventually defeats itself. She loses her
chance of happiness and incidentally the
happiness of her partner in life. It may be
that love is the crown of life; or it may be
that love is merely a little trick of Nature’s
for the perpetuation of the race, and that
consequently woman finds herself trying to
create a happy home out of what was really
only a skilfully-baited trap.
Even if love is the most important thing
in life, it certainly is not everything. If the
bump of amativeness were entirely eliminated
from one’s composition, life would still be
very much worth living and its interests
manifold and diverting. Too much stress is
laid upon the sex phase of fife, and as a
result false values and forced demands have
been created.
As a first measure of reform I would cut
out all the kissing and hugging scenes from
stage entertainments, and make the publica-
tion of the popular “mushy” type of literature
a punishable offence. The notion that
woman’s only mission in life is to appeal
to the sensual side of a man’s nature may
seem to a Turk a desirable state of mind in
the ladies of his harem, but modern men in
more enlightened places have other ideas.
Of course all men want affection from their
wives. And a few of them get it. But they
also want a comrade, someone who can under-
stand business worries, who is capable of dis-
cussing the topics of the day with a reason-
able amount of intelligence, who can keep a
secret, who may be chaffed without losing her
temper, who can appreciate the latest little
joke picked up in the city. If a wife could
supply all this a man would be much less
likely to visit his club, or that perfidious
but generally entertaining creature, the Other
Homan. But it is a depressing fact that
no matter how brilliant girls may be at
school, or how lighthearted and unconven-
tional through girlhood, a few years of mar-
ried life seems to find them all at the same
dead level, all inanely revolving in a groove
of the same dimensions.
And with every generation marriage ap-
pears to. become less of a success. But per-
haps this impression arises merely because
there is less reticence about airing the most
personal and intimate details of domestic
grievances. The black eye that has won
for the char ady the sympathy of the entire
neighborhood and threatens to provide
material for a paragraph in next week’s
police-court items would most probably have
been ascribed by her mother —and certainly
i srandmother-to a fall from the step-
ladder or a slight altercation with the clothes-
lme. lo suffer, says Stephen Leacock
is the one thing that a woman has learnt
a •f°c ! ;i )erfeCt But she no longer does
tin silence. If she did she would deprive
herself and her circle of feminine friends
and acquaintances of their chief source of
entertainment and interest. Nine out of
ten young married women of to-day have no
interests at all outside their own and the™
neighbors’ domestic circle. They simolv sit
and simmer in the juice of their matrimon
hashes and their outlook on life is as primi-
tive as the cave-woman’s: love, marriage a™d
reproduction, the trappings that will render
them more attractive to male eyes, the
preparation of food that will make an im-
pression on the male heart. Wherever two
or three are gathered together the same old
topics are dragged forth —all the love affairs
of the neighborhood, known and suspected;
the woman in the next street who dresses so
well that she can’t be all she ought to be;
the reasons why Mrs. So-AND-So can’t agree
with her husband; servants and how to
acquire them; babies and how to avoid them.
Newspapers are only picked up for the births,
marriages and deaths column, with any
divorce doings thrown in as a relish,
Literature only means a further pursuit of
their favorite themes elaborated and em-
broidered by such experts as Ethel Dell
and Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Art means
the latest thing in bead-work bags, or a new
method of touching up the complexion, or
the manoeuvres of Theda Bara in some
poisonous display at the pictures. The big
outside world where men are working for
their bread, where politicians are wrangling
over laws and reforms (and special com-
missions and trips to Europe), where scien-
tists are searching out new benefits for
mankind, where artists of the brush, chisel
and pen are immortalising beauty of form
and thought, where Nature is staging the
wonderful pageantry of the seasons and the
glory of the morning and evening skies —all
this seems remote.
It has been aptly said that a man’s busi-
ness is to prepare the world for children,
while the woman is preparing the children
for the world. But if she is herself lacking
in wordly wisdom how can she bring this task
to a successful issue? Having achieved
motherhood she is too apt, especially in later
life, to sit back and give herself airs in con-
sequence, forgetting that this function is
not peculiar to the species—that, as a mat-
ter of fact, the majority of the lower animals
make better mothers than the human parent.
They also have a way of forgetting that
motherhood is not generally an aim in itself
but merely an after-effect, and in its latter
and persistent recurrences a very unwelcome
one at that. It is not that woman is lack-
ing in affection towards her offspring.
Neither is a cow, although this feeling has
been not unreasonably described as only a
subtle form of self-appreciation. Every
woman is firmly convinced that her children
are different from and superior to all others,
that they are above the weaknesses and un-
touched by the temptations that are common
to youth. Though peculiarly in a position
to understand and influence their children,
mothers are usually the most misled with
regard to their true character. How often
have I heard a mother wind up with a
lamentation on the prevailing laxness of
morals in this vein : “Thank God, I have such
good sons, they never caused me a moment’s
uneasiness,” quite unaware of the amount of
uneasiness they may have caused in other
hearts or homes, or that among their acquaint-
ances their name is a by-word for loose living.
She thinks, good. soul, that, having provided
them with a Christian upbringing—hymns on
Sundays, texts in all the bedrooms, and grace
before meals —she has placed them perman-
ently beyond the reach of temptation. Mrs.
James Booth’s remark that “the most
worthless rakes can usually recall a pious
mother with tears in their eyes” is rather a
scathing commentary upon the degree of
influence in the home.
Let me conclude with a quotation from
Morgan, the well-known sociologist:—
The world needs woman’s understanding in its
guidance. With that understanding sex antago-
nism will disappear. It began in ignorance,
in savagery, and it will disappear with enlightenment.
If men were awake they would help women to
place their forces at the service of mankind. The
human female may add to the sum of beauty, re-
produce herself and pass away without having
fulfilled her appointed task because she has neglected
those gifts of mind and spirit which mark the
human being. It has been justly said that the
civilisations of Greece and Rome had not reached
a higher stage of morality because they failed to
utilize the mental and moral forces of the female
intellect, which is as essential to the progress and
preservation of Nations as the forces of men them-
selves.
If the future of our race is really in the
hands of woman, is it not high time that
she awakened to a proper sense of her re-
sponsibilities and deficiencies ?
LOUISE SICON.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Nation of Government Employees.
Dr. James Dtjhig, R.C. Archbishop of
Queensland, has been exploring the agricul-
tural districts of his State. In the course
of his travels he revisited Rosevale, a hamlet
about 40 miles south-west of Brisbane, where
he labored as a young priest. And out of
the fulness of his heart he spoke thus:—
The British settler is a declining factor in many
parts of Queensland. Were it not for the setback
which the war gave to German and other foreign
colonists, from 50 to 75 per cent, of the agricultural
holdings would now be in their possession. My visit
to Rosevale convinced me that serious steps ought
to be taken to stay the exodus of farmers’ sons from
the land. There are practically no young men
settling down. I saw houses abandoned that, in my
time as curate, contained large families, and I was
informed that the attendance at the State school had
fallen 50 per cent, within the last 10 or 15 years.
Most of the young people have left, and the farms
that have not been sold are being worked by the
aged parents, with the aid of a few faithful sons and
daughters who, here and there, have remained at
heme. The proportion of farmers’ sons in the police
force, the railways and other branches of the public
service is high. I believe the public service is made
altogether too attractive to young people. The com-
mencing salary is large, out of all proportion to
subsequent rises, and besides the high salary there
are the city attractions, always alluring to' young
people, and there is emancipation from the drudgery
of the farm and the entanglement of working clothes.
It is present ease versus future prosperity, and to
succumb to present ease is the trend of human nature.
There is no disputing the Archbishop’s facts,
nor do they stop at the borders of Queens-
land. The same drift from the farm that
was good enough for the old people, the
same rush for soft jobs in the constabularv.
the railways, the tramways, the fish-shops,
s°!’r ""-fo”ndr ; es ord refreshment-rooms,
the Barnacle and Red-tape and Sealing-wax
Departments, is going on in the other States.
Neither has the general tendency been
arrested to any noticeable extent by the
placing of soldier-settlers on ready-made
holdings at a cost, to the end of June, 1921,
of £26,426,515. While Germans and Italians
cultivate the soil the native-born Australians
are becoming a race of Government em-
ployees. They are encouraged by both the
Big-City parties—actively by the Labor
crowd, passively by the Nationalists —to
regard the State as the source of all material
benefits. When they want work, or unem-
ployment doles, or strike pay, or mother-
hood endowment Payments, or railway passes
to the country it is to the “Guvverment”
that they are invited to look, and they rarely
look in vain. One result of these multiply-
ing grants to constituents of Big-City poli-
ticians is that the Government services in
every State, Victoria perhaps excepted, are
shamefully overcrowded. The fact has
been cynically admitted, as far as N. S.
Wales and Queensland are concerned, by
members of the Government themselves, but
nothing has been done by these worthies,
or the parties to which they belong, to
remedy the evil, and nothing ever will be
done willingly, for it would involve the loss
of votes. The country’s one hope of relief
from the conditions which are strangling its
development is to break away from the Big
City and its ruinous paternalism and estab-
lish Governments of its own. In that case
it could set out earnestly to make rural life
attractive, instead of all the attractions being
clustered in one obese capital. Also it
would start by having a civil service propor-
tioned to its means and needs, in place of
one expanded beyond all reason in the inter-
ests of vote-buying city politicians and their
clients.
Where Do the People Come In?
When preferential voting was first mooted
in Australia there was an idea that it
would mitigate the scandal of Partyism;
perhaps kill it altogether. The Party sys-
tem is an affront to a democratic community
in several ways, but chiefly (1) by exclud-
ing from Parliament nearly all ’ but the
undesirable political types who will swallow
anything for a job ; and (2) by standing in
the way of minority representation. Pro-
portional representation, with its multitudi-
nous candidates representing all shades of
opinion, might have banished those evils if
it had been given a fair run; but, of course,'
the vested political interests, Labor and
anti-Labor, did not intend that it should
have anything of the sort. Striking examples
of how the will of the people is being defied
m this connection by the bosses in both
camps are already available in two Sydney
constituencies—Sydney and Eastern Suburbs.
The officials who control Nationalism, like
the staff men of the Labor army, have been
organising back-yard meetings for weeks past
to find out who shall be given the block
vote on polling day. This impertinent
device for getting to windward of the law
would not be so objectionable if the voting
was honest and if it was certain that the
executives would pay those who had taken
the trouble to register a vote of which the
Constitution has no cognisance the compli-
ment of automatically endorsing it. What
both executives are doing is to issue a warn-
ing that certain pliable characters must be
chosen again; to encourage more or less
corrupt voting in the interests of such use-
less representatives; and where a brigand,
bandit or independent has been selected, to
repudiate or oppose him. No personal sym-
pathy will be accorded to Mr. McGirr, who
was turned down by the A.L.P. executive
last week after the rank and file of the
Sydney electorate had chosen him by a large
majority. He was only a pre-selection can-
didate for this seat because he had, with the
same effrontery that led him to push one
brother into the Legislative Council, flung
mu an °tber brother his safe country seat,
lhe thing that must perturb upholders of
the principle of majority rule is that this
may happen not merely to Mr. McGirr
but to anybody. One of the members for
Eastern Suburbs is Mr. James Onslow. It
is his whim to bo called a Progressive. He
is the only member of the anomalous little
company of city-dwelling “farmers’ friends”
who clings to a shadowy independence. He
will not sign anything. And because he has
taken up this perfectly justifiable attitude
the Nationalist caucus has told him, in
effect, that his Parliamentary life may be
attempted.. To put it in another form, if
he abandons the Progressive team of five
which proposes to start for the Eastern
Suburbs event and orders his minions
throughout the constituency to give the bal-
ance of their preferences to Nationalist can-
didates, he will get Nationalist support: in
the other event he will be treated like a
Laborite. The effect of it all is that no
constituency can have an entirely indepen-
dent member, unless by a miracle, and that
no Parliament can be anything but an agglo-
meration of dummies who take their orders
■from a handful of often irresponsible bosses.
It is an indictable offence to vitiate an elec-
tion by impersonating an elector. Why
should it not also be an offence to conspire
to vitiate a Parliament? That is one of
the disservices which the. Party organisa-
tions are openly doing the community nowa-
days.

Harwell and the Brown Brother.
P. Airey (a former Home Secretary and
Treasurer of Queensland! sees rocks ahead:
When S.A. Premier Barwell enlarges on the un-
suitability of the Northern Territory for settlement
by a white race he is not very convincing; never-
theless there is a chance that he may be rig'ht,
after all. The progress of colonisation even in
Northern Queensland, to say nothing of the N.T.,
has not been of a nature, during the last half-
dozen years, to make an unprejudiced observer abso-
lutely cocksure that tropical Australia is infallibly
bound to be settled by the Caucasian in the long
run. Charters Towers, Croydon, Cloncurry and
Cooktown are only* the shadows of what they once
were, and the settlement in the Cairns hinterland
by no means compensates for the loss in the other
areas. W’hat Mr. Barwell apparently fails to
clearly realise is this —that you cannot populate a
considerable section of Australia with the brown,
black or yellow races without introducing the element
of racial discriminations and all the bloody and
eternal quarrels that inevitably result therefrom.
You cannot have a Free and United Australia half
white and half brown any more than Uncle Sam
(in Lincoln’s fine phrase) could continue to exist
“half slave and half free.”
The South Australian Premier thinks that some
method might be devised of bringing colored laborers
in for a term and then returning them to their native
land; but a Queensland experiment in that line made
with Japanese in Hugh Nelson's time proved a
disastrous failure, and the Progressives in India are
dead against the indenturing of Hindoos for service
abroad. But let us assume, for the sake of argument,
that Australia arranged with the Indian Government
to allow the introduction of 100,000 Hindoos for the
purpose of peopling and settling the Northern Terri-
tory. We get these colored fellow-subjects of ours
planted down along our Northern shores, and in the
meantime, as a result of the present insurrectionary
upheavals in India, a large measure of self-govern-
ment based upon an extensive franchise is granted
to that country. How long would it be before
RhamaduSthra Bux and Ram Dass, of the N.T.,
would be agitating for the same franchise privileges
as the white inhabitants of Australia? Let us sup-
pose, further, that the Indian Parliament, represent-
ing 350,000,000 subjects of the Empire, resolutely
backs them up in their demand and brings pressure
to bear on the British Government, and possibly,
also, on the League of Nations. What should we
do? The chances are that, ultimately, we should
have to make important concessions, for the whole
of the civilised colored races would make common
cause against us, and the day is now past when their
influence in the Council of Nations could be regarded
as a negligible quantity. What would follow? A
colored vote would mean a colored party in Parlia-
ment and racial strife throughout the length and
breadth of the country. A denial of the vote would
mean a much more embittered phase of racial trouble,
and the chance, moreover, of interference from out-
side Powers which may not always be as well dis-
posed as they appear to be at the present time.
We are too fond of assuming that Britain is bound
to protect us under all circumstances. We might
have a party of International Socialists in power in
the Old Land who might be quite honestly convinced
that the demand of the colored man in Australia for
full and complete rights as an Australian citizen
and as a British subject was perfectly justifiable,
and who might therefore decline to support us either
morally or physically in keeping Ram Dass in a
condition of unenfranchised servitude. What then?
Are we prepared to fight it out vi et armis, or are
we prepared to have simmering eternally in our midst
a deadly blood-feud such as Brother Jonathan is
enduring to-day? For if anyone imagines that the
12,000,000 of colored people in the States are going
to remain quiescent much longer he is woefully mis-
taken. The signs are far otherwise.
Let me be absolutely clear. I am not saying that
white settlement will yet prove a solution of the
N.T. question. That remains to be proved. But I
do say that it behoves Mr. Barwell to demonstrate
the possibility of Australia remaining a free, united
and harmonious Commonwealth with, say, one-third
of her population Asiatic and two-thirds" Caucasian.
A glance at conditions in Natal, in Fiji or in
America is by no means reassuring.
The Money-changers in the Temple.
The programme adopted by the Railways
Union for use in the N. S. Wales generul
election suggests two things—an inflated
idea of the railway-man’s importance and a
crazed idea about the unimportance of every-
body else. The first outstanding demand is
for a .share in the control. This would
bear every show of reason if the lines were
a private enterprise and the employees
weren’t represented on the Control. As a
matter of fact they are greatly over-repre-
sented. The vote of the young porter at
Muddlebury who pays no State taxes, and
doesn t contribute a copper towards squaring
the huge railway deficit, counts for quite as
much as that of the biggest taxpayer in the
land, and a certain "puii” trough his union
the body which arranges the strikes—
makes him count for more than the other
man. Notwithstanding this, the demand
is made that the employees shall have a
Commissioner all to themselves. That
woifid be one-fourth of the voting power
Where 600,000 male electors would have
o K U ]?An Com , misslonei ' s (° ne for 200,000), the
05,0tJ0 railway-men demand one to them-
selves, which would be more than five times
then-share, even if they gave up the share
they have, which isn’t so much as hinted at.
u ls , J de , slre i f fui 'ther, that the Union bosses
should be regularly” consulted on matters
ot management, and that .should be equal to
a few “ore votes per man. Certainly the
method would put the railway porter on a
lotty plane compared with the great mass
ot proprietors, who have no means of being
consulted. Two separate appeals are
demanded (one to the Minister, who can be
thieatened with a combination against him
on election day) before even the drunkest,
most dishonest, most uncivil or incapable or
superfluous employee can be disposed of. In
fact, the railway-man’s vested interest is to
be almost impregnable. At present the em-
ployees on every Australian railway system
receive the full product of their labor—the
whole net revenue that the Governments can
screw out of the public—and several millions
more which the income-tax payer has to
provide. This looks satisfactory enough for
them. But the programme goes on to
demand that the lines shall be burdened
with a new army of employees, partly by
reducmg hours and spreading the work out
further; partly by restoring the last of the
ldu strikers as an intimation that the strike
committees and not the representatives of the
nominal owners own the property ; and partly
by minor concessions. The general inspira-
tion is that 35,000 persons, largely non-
taxpayers, shall own the biggest public asset
of the country, and the takings thereof, and
receive a handsome subsidy to boot. The
share of the balance of the community is to
be the mortgage and such service and in-
civility as their masters choose to give them.
Only a crowd with a boundless faith in the
humility and kickableness of everybody save
itself would suggest job-control on that scale.
And only a crowd without any real regard for
the aspirations of the founders of the Labor
movement in Australian politics would
struggle for it. State and municipal enter-
prise once promised to do more for the people
than any other public policy in sight. It offered
a means of escape from the private-enterprise
extortioner whose capacity for profiteering
was so well illustrated during the war. But
unhappily the corrupt politician saw his
opportunity and proceeded to purchase office
with so-called concessions to State and muni-
cipal employees; and then the employees
themselves took a hand and chaffered for
further concessions. So State and municipal
enterprise, instead of being a blessing to the

Wheat and Captain Cook.
Australian politicians of the self-seeking-
type—that is to say, most politicians—are
fiercely hostile to the breaking up of the
Big States, holding that their small dignity
and the pride of their Bumbledom are based
on the number of acres they rule over. They
hate to develop new towns and cities and
ports in their own State, because if the One
Bloated Spot ceases to hold the majority
of votes the breaking up of the Big States
will become possible. City papers which
prefer that the nearest rival of their own
size should be (500 miles away instead of
60 are of the same way of thinking. But
it is necessary to show some interest in the
depopulation of the country districts, the
“settlement” of which is the daily snuffle of
every charlatan, and to suggest some remedy
apart from the one and only and obvious
remedy. Weird things happen in this struggle
to “save face.” Thus Sydney Telegraph,
in a recent leader
The people cannot open up lands to absorb multi-
tudes of new but they have given no sign
that they would be unwilling to support any Govern-
ment which would open up the virgin lands, now
much as they were, but for a few wandering herds
and flocks, when Captain Cook spied out the country
a century and a half ago.
This is evidently a plea for more of that
ill-starred son of hard toil and frequent
misery, the wheat-grower. He is beloved
of politicians because it is possible to dis-
pose of more troublesome people on a given
area with wheat than with sheep. It isn’t
necessary to find them short hours and basic
wages—any hours and wages serve for “the
like of them.” And the cry about breaking
up the big estates- —not the Big States—is
always popular. Yet Australia, and especi-
ally N. S. Wales, shouldn’t be too. haughty
and scornful about its “few wandering herds
and flocks.” In 1917-18, a very ordinary
year, they brought wandering into Australia
nearly £43,000,000 as payment for exports,
which saved the community from defauU
and disgrace. On the other hand, wheat
and flour brought in a little over £10,000,000.
It was a heart-breaking result considering
the effort, the booming, and the money spent
to foster the industry; but, then, it is a
heart-breaking job to grow wheat for export
under Australian conditions, both rs to
climate and as to the situation of the wheat
lands in relation to the world’s markets. The
“wandering herds and flocks” were a saving
influence on the railways, too. On the N. S.
Wales lines wool pays nearly three times
the actual cost of carriage, so that wheat
may be carried at half-cost, it being unable
to stand more. This Commonwealth wants
closer settlement in the shape of small towns
with factories and foundries in them—if
its crazed politicians would cease from, the
idea that it is their business to kill every
factory at sight, as if it. was a mad dog. It
wants cotton fields, for it wants cotton ; and
it has much land where sheep and cold-
weather- vegetables don’t flourish. And it
wants to prize its jumbuck as a gift from
Heaven, even though it does take up space.
Population is needed in empty places; but
a brisk little manufacturing town and a lot
of medium-sized sheep-farms may make a
denser average population for a whole county
than a thousand disheartened wheat-growers
scattered around the typical wheat town,
whose visible occupation for most of the
year consists of watching the non-paying
train in and out.
Suttee in Our Time.
The first meeting of the committee of doc-
tors appointed by the N. S. Wales branch
of the B.M.A. to devise prophylactic meas-
ures against V.D. occurred in Sydney last
week. There was no divergence of opinion as
to the efficacy of prophylaxis. The startling
success of chemical disinfection during the
closing years of the war in all the armies
on the Western Front, and notably in that
of the U.S.A., where it was carried out most
drastically, established, once and for all, that
if this practice could be made general the
world’s deadliest plague might be diminished
almost to vanishing point. With other
measures, calling for equal vigor and sacri-
fice, it might be possible to exterminate it
altogether. And why not? One of the
speakers explained:—
If the endeavors of the profession in regard to
prophylaxis were to be successful it would be neces-
sary to get the support of public opinion. This would
come, it was hoped, when the “cloak of false modesty
and the barrier of silence had been removed.”
It would be preposterous to suggest that
public opinion favors the perpetuation of
V.D. What, no doubt, this speaker meant
was that some people, who are usually old
and often childless, would rather see the
hospitals, general and mental, filled as here-
tofore with V.D. victims and the lives of
innocent women and children ruined, than
have “sin” made any safer than it is at
present. Regarded as a religious principle
this is simply a variant of the Indian rite
of Suttee, which was disallowed nearly a
century ago, the difference being that the
Hindu widow destroyed herself while the
Australian puritan intends that someone else
shall be destroyed. In every case where the
safety of the nation, or even the general wel-
fare, is threatened all sorts of strongly-held
convictions'have to be swallowed; and the
measure of a nation’s progress may be said
to j )e largely an affair of its Government’s
capacity to impose such discipline. There
j s nothing the Britisher sets more store by
than his personal liberty. When the influ-
enza epidemic came along the medical pro-
fession confessed to ignorance of its aetiology;
b ut ma sks were believed by some doctors to
b e preventives, and so in many parts of the
Commonwealth, the wearing of masks was
made compulsory, and as a general thing
this trying order was obeyed . Plague has

strongly held, than the other. If it is
agreed, as logically it must be, that the
people who object to Y.D. prophylaxis, ot-
to any other method originated by the medical
profession to banish this curse, have no
more right to impose their prejudices on the
nation than those who object to influenza or
plague prophylaxis, then the duty of the
Government becomes clear. It will approach
Y.D. from the same angle that it has
already approached the rest oi the deadlier
contagious diseases; and from that moment,
since its cause and cure are equally well
understood by the doctors, it will begin to die.

Land-Grant Railways.
“Sol. Maeaprop” throws mud at a fetish
Why doesn’t Barwell, Premier of South Aus.,
throw his soul into a fight for a land-grant railway
from Darwin to Port Augusta instead of going back
to the superannuated morass of colored labor advo-
cacy? Colored niggers w-ouldn’t make Tropical
Australia a whit more accessible, though they would
supply it with race disturbances, Moplah or similar
civil wars, mixed marriages, shindies between mixed
sects, and the joy of wanting the land very badly
for our own folk some day and not getting it. In
short, the idea is to make the North another Ulster,
with murk and heathenism added, under the foolish
impression that the Murky One will work for us
instead of for himself. The land-grant proposition
isn’t one-tenth so repugnant to Australian ideas as
the black-brother idea. In fact, this country has
adopted it, and is committed to it, though it seems
quite oblivious to the fact. South Aus. contracted
for the Commonwealth to build a line across the con-
tinent for a grant of about 200,000 acres of land
per mile of route. The route was specified and the
terms were clear enough. True, there are signs of a
tendency on the part of the Federal Government to
be a defaulter; but that doesn’t alter the fact of
the agreement; and a wiser sort of Barwell would
concentrate on the point that the land-grant railway
is an accepted feature of Australia. Upon this he
would demand that, if the Commonwealth can t or
won’t carry out its bargain, it shall sublet the job
cheaply to someone who can and will. In doing so
he would be standing on his obvious rights, while
the colored-labor madness is a mere foolish giving-
away of his case. It suggests that he isn’t sure
of his position, so is willing to take niggers in lieu
of rails, and it implies, quite wrongly, that the
North, being naturally black, isn’t worth a white
man’s railway. Australians have a hazy idea that
Government lines (really owned by the private money-
lender) are ■ a sort of fixed rule in this country, and
that any departure from the system is a bursting
of the Ark of the Covenant. It is one of many
popular delusions, for there were recently 2809
miles of private railroad in the Commonwealth.
Apparently the Australian, like the Chinaman, thinks
along lines all his own, and certainly he does things
which it is hard to imagine any other white man
doing. The only railway on the construction pro-
gramme which is worth building under existing
conditions is the one from South to North. It will
reduce the distance across Australia bv one-half;
open up the Federal Government’s own great estate ;
and open a short business route to Europe and Asia,
Besides, it is half-built, and the half is going to
waste for lack of completion. On top of all it
is the only work to which the Commonwealth’s honor
is pledged. Yet it is the one undertaking that is
treated as a bad joke. On the other hand the Com-
monwealth rushed to build a huge line to which it
wasn’t pledged, for which it wasn’t paid, and which
only benefitted State property—not its own. This
silly business was doomed from the first because it
had the desert on one side so that there was no trade
from that direction, while on the other side it
hugged the Great Australian Bight, and the carriage
footboards overhung the water. To complete the
ludicrous tale this land route was so much longer
than the old sea route that competition has been a
failure from the first. A community which habitually
runs its affairs on lines like these is in a catalogue
by itself, like its own bunyip and barramundi.
“Ark” : Australia’s neglect of the rich
Malayan market, in which it could be
supreme, makes an old Digger (I was in the
original 13th) sad. Canada and California are
struggling desperately to get a share of the
trade, and the English manufacturer sends
of his best, but the Australian tinned stuff
one sees (there isn’t much of it) is badly
packed and worse labelled. In fact, out-
wardly there couldn’t be a rottener advt.
for the country. I was present when a sales-
man in the biggest store in the F.M.S. was
asked about a certain article of tinned food.
‘‘Oh,” he replied disgustedly, “I can > t
recommend that. It’s only Australian ’’
“Only Australian!” It hurt. And yet I
knew it was every bit our own fault. Even
in the matter of our trade representatives
we have been slovenly. An Australian man-
ager was visiting these parts lately. “You
won’t mind if I don’t introduce you as an
Australian commercial man, will you?”
said his friend on the way to meet " so- e
people. “If I do you’ll have, for a start
to carry the sins of many rotters.” This
is another point to which Australian houses
have given quite insufficient attention.
“Hanno” : At the Hobart conference of the
Australian National Councils of Women there
was much glib talk about the sterilisation
of the unfit, most of it from women obvi-
ously ignorant of the medical and legal
aspects of the matter. Theoretically there
is a little to be said in favor of it, but,
practically, nothing. Wherever such a
measure has been placed on the statute book
it has been abandoned. Sterilisation was
first suggested b.v reformers of the fanatical
wowser breed in xYmerica, and has never
been supported by medical or legal experts,
both of whom are fully aware not only of
the obstacles which would obstruct the
operation of ; it. but also of the doubtful
value of it. To the medical jurist, it is
impossible to fix a hard and fast line
separating those who should from those who
should not be treated. In U.S.A. 10 or 12
years ago, several States, notably Maine and
Connecticut, enacted that people declared
habitual criminals, habitual drunkards, pros-
titutes and other social misfits cquld be
operated upon after each case had been
inquired into by a special medical board.
Quite a number of people it was proposed to
deal with were gathered in, but not a single
operation was performed, and a few months
later the legislation was repealed. Tlie
cause of this was that the U.S. Supreme
Court, in a test case, had held that no State
or Federal legislation could take away from
a citizen a number of inalienable rights,
among them that of propagating his own
species, and the lid was clamped down a
little tighter by the action of the American
Medical Association, a body like our 8.M.A..
in declaring that any surgeon who rendered
a person sterile, whether under the provi-
sions of any law or not, would be guilty
of malpractice and treated accordingly. The
idea is one that belongs to the realm of
freak legislation, and, scientifically, is
founded on a most insecure basis, inasmuch
as it assumes that certain characteristics are
always inherited from the generation imme-
diately preceding.
—_— ♦
“T.R.TI.”: In Vie. a person in custody and
suspected to be of unsound mind is supposed
to be immediately sent to the Receiving
House for observation. Actually, all the
“dilly” cases are “remanded for seven days’
medical treatment.” The last Government
Medical Officer, J. A. O’Brien, and the
present G.M.0., C. G. Godfrey, agree that
this is a scandal. Insane men should not
be mixed with criminals even for seven days.
Afterwards, some candid friend is sure to
say in a stage whisper “He’s been in gaol.”
W. A. Hughes has been “super” at the
Melbourne gaol hospital for a quarter of a
century, and it is one of the sorrows of his
life that so manv harmless old men are sent
to gaol, instead of to homes, for such vague
offences as “vagrancy” and “asking alms.”
Incidentally, Melbourne Gaol Hospital
accommodates about 30 patients, and though
it treats 1000 yearly, with a death-rate of
1 per 1000, the pay for hospital work is
woefully small.
“Tropicus” (Port Moresby) concurs: —
The idea of “Gregor” (B. 1/12/’2l) for the
formation of a New Guinea Society is a good one.
No time should be lost in recording the fast-
disappearing customs, legends, languages and other
features and aspects of aboriginal life in the great
island which, so far, have only been studied by a
handful of scientists whose observations are mostly
buried in far-scattered libraries in the Old World.
Papua’s national collection of old-time weapons,
canoes, clothing, pottery, etc., offers good material
for organised study. This collection, which was
founded by William Macgregor, is housed in Bris-
bane, and since the Commonwealth took over the
territory steady effort has increased its value till
now it is probably the finest of its kind in the world.
Certainly it can never be duplicated. And with two
trained anthropologists already on the official staff
in Papua much can be and is being done along
the lines followed by the Fijian Society. Papua is
a vast field in itself, for with innumerable small
communal groups, each very different in many
particulars from its neighbors, the trained observer
could give almost his whole life to the study of
only a small portion of the great territory. With a
society properly organised for the purpose a vast
amount of the rapidly-disappearing data now avail-
able could be preserved ; but every year means th«
loss of interesting information, so rapid is th<
advance of modem ideas among the islanders.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Meredith Atkinson, the insufferably superior
Melbourne don who a year ago heaped
scorn on the imbeciles who couldn’t see
that the Bolshevik rulers of Russia were
great statesmen, has inspected his Marxian
paradise at close quarters. Without admit-
ting that he was wrong—that would be too
much to expect—he reports that the Bol-
shevik economic policy has broken down,
that there is no production worth mention-,
ing, that the transport system is a horrible
chaos, that the Government departments are
honeycombed with incompetents and suffer
from indescribable inefficiency, that black
bread costs 28.000 roubles a pound (the
rouble was worth 2s. before the war),
that a million roubles go to the pound sterling,
that another food crisis is coming and
that the economic reconstruction of the
stricken country by foreign nations is hope-
less for the present—the problem is too
gigantic, the ruin too absolute. In fine,
“it will be years before Russia is fit for
habitation by civilised beings.” Such are the
fruits of the “dictatorship of the prole-
tariat,” which a poisonous crew of Labor
extremists would inflict on Australia.
Having manoeuvred himself into a soft
London billet, leaving the debris, of his fatal
administration to be cleared away by others,
Fihelly of Queensland has taken to giving
snuffling advice to the country his Govern-
ment has almost ruined. The other day he
said this :—•
We want to build into artisans and tradesmen
the young people now growing up, and teach them
something more than just clerical work or laboring.
We do not want a nation of laborers and typewriter
punchers, which I regret to say our technical col-
leges are turning out.
Considering that it is precisely Fihelly’s
crowd that has encouraged the swarming
key-tapper and unskilled laborer by restrict-
ing apprenticeship and creating hosts of jobs
“in the Guvverment,” this is about the finest
exhibition of “cant, humbug and hypocrisy”
on record.
N. S. Wales added, some £150,000 a year
to its outgoings the other day, and got noth-
ing at all in return. It was merely black-
mailed that amount because it had in-
curred a debt, and, though the day of repay-
ment was known, not a copper had been pro-
vided. If, when a certain heap of 4 p.c.
stock was issued, the State had been willing
to pay 6 p.c., the odd 2 p.c. being a provision
for repayment, the debt would have paid
itself off on the due date, and the sharks
who demanded a fancy price for their for-
bearance would have sharked in vain. Be-
cause the Ma. State, looking neither before
nor after, didn’t pay 6 p.c. for a few years,
it is now pledged to pay 6| p.c. indefinitely.
The proud Ma State has the biggest debt
in Australasia, and its sinking fund (it really
has a sinking fund) is the smallest. Tas-
mania has nearly twice as, much, and West-
ralia nearly 20 times as much, though their
liabilities, added together, are only about
one-third those of slipshod old Ma.
The usual pronouncement from old Father
Stodge:—
The Premier, speaking at the Agricultural Show
luncheon yesterday, said before wages were reduced
the price of money, profits and rents must come down.
Well, profits have come down. The very
biggest business in N.S.W. is Dooley’s rail-
ways, and they are expected to show a loss
of anywhere between one and two millions.
It is only one among many concerns that
have published balance-sheets lately. Broken
Hill and Cobar and Newcastle Steel and
Lysaght’s and Mort’s Dock profits have
fallen enough to satisfy the most ravenous
fuller and dropper ever born. Interest and
rents can’t go down much while „he clamor-
ing of Dooley for more loans keeps the rate
up, and while the Dooley policy prevents
house-building; but prices are on the down-
grade sure enough, flight alongside Dooley’s
pronouncement was the usual official report
of the big reauctions (34 per cent, in the
case of meat) effected during the year—
that disastrous year in which wages received
the last artificial jerk upwards that busted
the holy show and threw 40,000 N. S. Wales
citizens out of employment.
It now looks as if Hughes will withdraw
his interdict on the admittance of German
experts to superintend the erection of that
briquetting plant for the Vic. Electricity
Commissioners; and if the industry turns
out a success, he rvill, of course, claim all
the credit. The importance of the business
doesn’t lie in the admittance or otherwise
of these half-dozen. It has been a kite-
flying affair so far as the Priminister is con-
cerned ; and it has shown him that Hun
hate is almost dead in Victoria. And Hughes,
being an opportunist, will act accordingly.
London Daily Mail has just had an
article on “Men who Pay to Work.” The
men are Australian State Governors; and
of course the article is apropos the retire-
ment of Weigall and Allardyce. Those re-
tirements have made good copy for English
papers; and by the dozen they are asking
why Australia doesn’t pay a living wage to
its high officials. And it is no use replying
that State Governors are not high officials,
and that in more sensible places like Canada
a Judge or University Professor or some such
person does all the real work of the job
before breakfast.
Members of the A.W.U., it was stated last
week, have decided enthusiastically for the
One Big Union, the voting being 18,649 to
3889. These figures look impressive till it
is remembered that not 12 months ago the
A.W.U. was alleged to have 102,000 ticket-
holders, which means that nearly four-fifths of
the union didn’t trouble, or weren’t asked, to
vote. Either that or there is something in
the story that thousands of veteran union-
THE DAZED DANCER.
ists, fed-up with smellful ballots, senseless
work-stoppages, unnecessary levies, riotous
extravagance and other departures from the
traditions of a once-great organisation
haven’t renewed their tickets. But the
A.W.U. heads are as dumb as oysters about
the internal affairs of their union, though
unweariedly voluble about Ireland and
Russia.
It is significant that at the Labor selec-
tion ballot the biggest vote cast in Sydney
and suburbs went to Motherhood Minister
McGirr, who promises to maintain the basic-
wage no matter how the selling value of the
goods produced may fall, while the man who
was squeezed out is Minahan, who is a boot-
manufacturer. Probably Minahan lacked
the proper fervor about the idea of paying
more for 44 hours with low prices than was
paid for 48 hours with high ones. Minahan,
as a large employer, will have to pay the
wages. McGirr, as a large landlord, will
collect them.
According to economists of the Dooley
school, reducing the working week by
per cent, shouldn’t make any difference to
the cost of production. Yet workers who
have taken possession of houses built for
them under the slowing-down system by the
N. S. Wales Government find, on receiving
their bills, that they have been charged
hundreds of pounds more than the price
agreed upon. One man who arranged to buy
a Government cottage for £657 has been
presented with an account for £1138. Nearly
all these victims of the 44-hour mania have
refused either to pay the amounts asked or
to quit the houses. And as an election is
due shortly and the Government wants all the
votes it can scrape together they are staying
on rent-free until the weather breaks. But
when Ma State manufacturers, burdened by
the 44-hour week and the fraudulent basic
wage, point out that they can’t compete on
equal terms with rivals in_ other countries
who pay their men 25 to 50 per cent, less
and work them 8£ to 34 per cent, longer,
the Dooley crowd are loftily scornful, and
talk darkly about “a conspiracy to reduce
wages.”
Queensland’s annoyances include at the
moment the record list of unemployed, the
record railway deficit, the record plain rev-
enue deficit, a decline in the number of fac-
tories and factory workers (no other State
has this), the smallest average male factory
wage so far as the continent is concerned,
practically all its metal mines stopped, a
decline in savings bank deposits per head,
the second biggest debt per head in
the Commonwealth, the most rapidly in-
creasing debt, a great falling off in
land settlement and the heaviest State taxa-
tion per head (twice that of Victoria, and £2
per inhabitant per annum above the average
for all the States). Ryan, who started the
present policy, left the State to run the
Commonwealth ; and if the kind of Govern-
ment which is hitting up the North had the
use of the army, navy, Commonwealth Bank,
note issue, Post Office and trust funds, and
had all Australia to play with, tchat a time-
there would have been! And it will come —
if the tired feeling on polling-day continues.
Having ascertained from the Common-
wealth Statistician that the cost of living
has dropped 11.8 per cent, in 12 months,
the Queensland Arbitration Court has re-
duced the basic wage in Brisbane from
£4 'ss. a week to £4 as from March 1. In
announcing the Court’s decision Justice
McCawley pointed out that £4 has a higher
purchasing power to-day than £4 ss. had
12 months ago. The same is broadly true
of conditions in N. S. Wales; but when the
Board of Trade lowered the Sydney mini-
mum from £4 ss. to £4 2s. the Dooley Gov-
ernment tried to knock out the reduction by
legislative enactment, and announced its
intention of exacting another million or
two from the public to pay Government em-
ployees on the £4 ss. basis. The plot was
temporarily frustrated by the change of
Ministry, but that is the Dooley policv still.
It remains to be seen whether Theodore will
sink to the Sydney crowd’s level.
Dan Levy, the N. S. Wales Speaker,
didn’t have to wait long for what was com-
ing to him. He offered himself for selection
by the “electoral conference” of the Sydney
Nationalist Association. There were seven
candidates for five nominations, and the
badly-shocked Daniel finished a poor sixth.
Of course, he had forfeited his claim to
Nationalist support. All the same, by re-
fusing him endorsement the clumsy National-
ist heads have given the other side a chance
of calling off the general election and hang-
ing on to office, with the Man without a
Party as Speaker, for another 13 months.
The Drys in South Aus. have asked the
Government to make experiments in the using
of grapes for purposes other than wine-
making. At a deputation to the Minister of
Agriculture, soldier settlers’ representatives
said they were getting nervy, and would like
to see an alternative market. Nearly a
dozen side-lines were named as flourishing
in California. Minister Pascoe promised to
get particulars. In fact, he said, his depart-
ment had written on the subject to both
California State and the U.S.A. Federal
Government six months ago, but had got no
reply from either.
To match the Nationalists’ proposition of
“decentralisation by the creation of admini-
strative subdivisions within the State,” the
N.S.W. Progressives put on their programme
“developmental railways to new ports.” But
“new ports” needn’t buv new suits for the
opening ceremony. The railway which is
meant to develop places like Coff’s Harbor
or Twofold Bay will come when the local
people are in a position to manage it them-
selves, and not a moment sooner.
Mort’s Dock, one of the great industries
of Sydney, has passed out of the dividend
list for the time. That insane thing, the
retrospective award, took a heap of money
which it couldn’t recover from its customers.
The 44-hour week added one-twelfth to costs
without anything to show for it. Extra
taxes and a habit jobs got into of going to
Melbourne did the rest. Suspension of divi-
dends is a first stage. The next, if things
don’t improve or if they grow worse, is sus-
pension of wages.
“Fax”: Without discussing Hughes’s
veto on the landing of half-a-dozen
Hun chemists and engineers for coal-
briquette manufacture, one may reason-
ably protest against the bunkum talked
by the other side. At an Engineers’ Con-
ference in Melbourne Mr. Newbigin said
“there had recently been some discussion
about alien engineers. As scientific men
they knew neither race nor creed.” Non-
sense ! Melbourne was full of alien scien-
tists when the war broke out. A world’s
conference of them was being held, and the
violent anti-Britishness of the German pro-
fessors was not more surprising than their
inability to perceive anything indecent and
discourteous in their ravings. Professors
of science were no different from Scharff,
professor of music at Melbourne Uni., who
assured his pupils that “der Germans vere
aboud to dwist der Pritish Lion’s tail.” But
there is less objection to engaging the ser-
vices of specialists for a year than there
was to maintain Scharff in his billet until he
became so offensive that he had to be in-
terned.
Judging by the outer aspect of things one
might believe that thousands were spent in
the game of grab to secure the Labor nomi-
nation for Sydney. The event looked like a
general election, with its polling-booths,
ballot-papers, returning-officers, scrutineers
and (this was anew feature) private
detectives. In other words, the wily
candidate knew how the party wins
elections, and swore by all his gods not
to be hoist with his own petard. And
in one way or another —in salary or robbery
or both—-the community pays for it all.
Australia keeps a number of Trade Com-
missioners, and they keep a dead silence,
which is broken once in a brown rpoon. This
was the latest break, as it appeared in the
daiiy press :
The Australian Trade Commissioner in China has
informed the Director of the Bureau that Americans
are shipping large quantities of wheat to China.
Says the despatc h: “I very much regret that Austra-
lian suppliers have not found it possible to obtain
a much larger proportion of the orders for wheat. . . .
I am informed that the Americans have taken orders
for at least 60,000 tons, but would not be surprised
to hear that it is nearer 100,000 tons, as against our
3700 tons.”
Australia pays Trade Commissioners, and
supplies them with costly staffs and offices,
in order that they may send us news of how
good business skips past us in this fashion.
Perhaps if the man who selected the Com-
missioners had the ghost of an idea of busi-
ness himself, instead of being merely an
eloquent person who can sway an audience,
the results might be different.
Dr. C. M. Davidson, of Rockhampton,
writes from South Germany that German
factories are in full swing, that millions
have been spent on new works and that
financial men do’n’t know what to do with
their money:—
German goods find their way into Australia
through other countries, and Australia is giving
these countries an intermediate profit. When will
Australia wake up and realise that the capture of
the world’s trade by Germany is looming ahead?
When the terrorised trade-unionist realises that his
union' kills his industry it will be too late. The Aus-
tralian worker must realise that he must compete
with the outside worker, or unemployment will fol-
low. The German people are very pleased to be
compelled to save £300,000,000 on the cost of
their Army and Navy.
Of course, we can keep our own market for
our own manufactures. A Customs tariff
will do that for us. But that does not end
the matter. We owe a few hundred mil-
lions outside Australia and we’ve got to pay
interest on that money—have, in fact, con-
tracted to repay the principal itself. And
that can only be done by exporting gold
(which we haven’t got) or goods, and for
the present that means such things as wool,
wheat and metals. And that’s where the
trouble comes in; because if the Australian
farmer has to pay sky-high prices for his
requirements he simply can’t compete with,
the foreign farmer who gets low-priced
machinery, fertilisers, clothes and other
necessaries. For a nation that is heavily in
debt to the outsider, Customs duties can’t
take the place of hard work and steady
industry.
THE ONE THING WANTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You see here the British race at its best. But
we have not a good enough conceit of ourselves.
That is the trouble.” —Prime Minister Hughes at
the A.N.A. banquet in Melbourne.
In courage strong, in patience like a Job,
Gentle in speech and broad in all his views,
Enwrapped in nobleness as with a robe,
There yet is something wanting in our Hughes.
He represents the Briton at his best,
’Midst human nature one of God’s elite,
Yet of one weakness William stands contest—
He has not half-enough of self-conceit.
O Lord, let William Hughes his value know!
Teach him to swell with modest conscious pride,.
To push his chest out and to softly blow,
To raise his voice at times and put on side,
To interfere in all affairs of State,
Assume control of sugar, wool and wheat,
To act as though he were the hand of Fate-
In short, to have a proper self-conceit.
VICTORIA.
O. K.


THE ENCUMBRANCES.
"Owing to their huge additions of population Sydney and Melbourne have increased the nnmber of their Federal constituencies by three at the expense of the ooirntry behind them.”

Were both the dear charmers away.”

Profits in the table include additions .'to an
insurance fund; and •as £3164 was added
tor the past year the net profit shown by the
directors was £46,406. That was £735
short of fhe amount required to pay 8 p.c.
on capital, despite the abolitioh of concfes-
sion tickets and, later, the increases de-
manded of season-ticket passengers. Be-
cause of the higher fares or for some other
reason there was a falling-off of traffic, and
that operated adversely along with the
higher operating costs due to increased
wages and a 44-hour week at the workshops.
But the public is left to guess at the pre-
cise effect of_ these various influences ; the
management is not at all communicative in
figures. And, as ih the past considerable
juggling was done in the balance-sheets, the
public cannot be blamed for refusing »to
swallow anything, relating’ to this coJ With-
out evidence; certainly the directors cannot
expect any. sympathy until they become more
confiding in the published accounts. Ybu
learn next to nothing from them. Instead
of the Profit and Loss account explaining
the extent to which revenue has fallen and
expenses have increased, there is merely
one entry which sets down what the direc-
tors declare to be the net profit after they
have, made “provision for depreciation, etc.’’
No indication whatever is; given as to thy
allowances made for depreciation and
etceteras, and, for all the public can learn,
unreasonably, large amounts might be put
aside ostensibly to off-set the wastage of
assets. It is unlikely that anything of the
sort is happening nowadays, though: the
fact that the Profiteering Court refused to
regulate fares after the co.’s affairs had once
more been subjected to scrutiny by account-
ants hints that in the early months the
directors were not able to earn fat profits,
but, instead, were finding difficulty in making
ends meet.
The true position of this ferry monopoly
was further clouded a couple of years ago
by the division of the old co. 'into two.
“Business not directly connected with the
ferry traffic” was passed over to the Har-
bor, Land and Transport Co., Ltd., repre-
sented in the parent co.’s balance-sheet bv
£107,000 of ! “investments in dther cOsi”
This subsidiary publishes no accounts, and
the extent of its profits is not disclosed.
In their latest report the directors do an-
nounce that one-fourth of the dividends dis-
tributed by Sydney Ferries, Ltd., was pro-
vided by the subsidiary. But in the previous
year, when 9J p.c. divs. were paid, no mention
was made of the profits so derived. This
subsidiary provides a very convenient reser-
voir from which the principal co.’s disclosed
earnings can be regulated. For the several
reasons set out above, the accounts of Svd-
ney Ferries, Ltd., as presented, to the public,
are not sufficiently informative (1) to
assure its customers that they will get a
fairer deal than they had in the past, when.
the co.’s exactions meant that its passengers
were buying new steamers for shareholders,
or (2) to give shareholders—some of whom
bought in at top prices and are, therefore, get-
ting a poor return on their investment-
confidence in the co.’s position. The fat
days of the Sydney Ferries have gone, and
the directors mav as well face the inevitable
and give their co. a footing as a sound in-
vestment concern which will settle down
to uniform dividends. The co. is at present
in bad odor with the great majority of its
customers, and even Royal Commissions
have cast doubts on its bona ftdos; such, for
instance, as the Board of Trade’s opinion of
the division of the business—one reason for
that move, the Board declared, “was a
desire to protect part, at least, of its opera-
tions and affairs from public scrutiny or
investigation.”
Present conditions are wholly unsatisfac-
tory to all parues concerned, either as share-
holders or as customers. Surely the direc-
tors do not require legislative action to bring
them to a sense of their responsibilities as
controllers of a public service? Unless* per-
haps, they have hopes that any such action
might enable them to capitalise all hidden
reserves as the gas cos. were permitted to
do in 1912. A Royal Commission a few
years ago ascertained that the fleet, was
worth, disregarding temporary fluctuations,
a quarter-million more than the accounts
claimed. If the directors came forward with
a definite policy to the effect that in. future
they did not intend to pay more than 8 p.c.
p.a. on capital, which is what Commisioner
F. N. Yarwood considered would be “a fair
and reasonable expectancy,” the. co. would
reinstate itself in public estimation. It
could then lay all its cards on the table in
the form of complete accounts, and would
certainly have nothing to lose by such
action. Otherwise, sooner or later, it will
be forced by the Legislature to do something
of the sort.
These remarks are prompted by a consider-
ation of the future. Some of the services
are starved, and ahead is the problem of
financing new steamers. By all appear-
ances considerable new capital will be
required, and the. prospects of raising, suffici-
ent funds are not good while the future of
the co. is in doubt. It would not be surpris-
ing if, for the first time in its career, a
preference issue may not be necessary later
to give the necessary capital, and if money
cheapens that should be a gooff move. Dur-
ing the past year a new vehicular steamer
was added to the fleet, a new passenger
boat will be ready by March, and another
about Miiy. During the period £25,482 of
new capital helped the construction pro-
gramme, but after payment of the latest
.iv- the co. had a surplus of liquid assets,
including stores and fuel, over and above
liabffities of under £4500. There is, how-
ever, £90,660 callable on the contribs., but
it is doubtful whether that will be adequate
to make the> fleet efficient: for near-future
requirements.

The Paterson, Laing and Bruce business was
turned over to a public co. in London in ’97,
but the co. reconstructed four years later,
when several other interests were absorbed’,
lor goodwill £161,192 had been paid, hence
the deficit (that is, the portion of capital not
represented by tangible assets) which figures
m the opening entries of the table. At
,t a .ti° n it was stipulated that the quarter-
million of ordinaries were not to receive more
that 6 per annum until reserves of
£lOO,OOO, invested wholly outside the business,
had been accumulated. The full amount
had been set aside some years before the div.
rate was lifted: in 1917, for instance, when
the 6 p.c. was still being. paid, £BO,OOO of
other reserves had piled up. Then the war-
fMtening began: in the three years 1918-
19-20 the ordinary div. averaged 10§ p.c.
p.a., and meantime £85,158 was added to
visible reserves. The latest accounts also
admit that. £26,000 went into a taxation
reserve that was not required. Having-
been strengthened in this way, the big co.
was in a good position when the crash came.
Taking the £26,000 transferred from the
taxation reserve into account, 1921’s loss
was £39,746, representing only a portion of
the extra profit which had been won in the
abnormally good trading years. If stock
values had. beep got down to replacement
value at the last balance, then P., L. and
B. can be regarded as having come thus far
through the war-orgy and its after-effects'
with some thousands of additional reserves,
after having away to ordinary share-
holders £36,250 more than they would have
got had the 6 p.c. continued; But in view
of the heavier taxation and increased cost
of everything the additional divs. ' really
didn’t mean much more to shareholders. *
The high value of stocks demanded the
ass’stance .of additional funds, and in 1920
£150,000 of 2nd 6 p.c. cum. prefs, were got
in. This shows balance-sheet movements
during the past three years and since the
pre-war accounts:—

Stocks and liabilities were still enormously
large at the balance, and much depends on
how successful the unloading proved. More
than half a year has passed since the
accounts closed, and big changes have since
taken place; if stocks proved saleable, and
re-adjusted bopk values were right, then the
co.’s discomfort has no doubt eased consider-
ably. It was fortunate in one respect: the
new capital was not expensive, though the
£150,000 of new prefs. means £9OOO more
divs. which the management must find every
year. The co. is also helped by £230.000
of mortgage debentures which carry only
4f p.c, This issue is redeemable at £llO p.c.
in 1950.

The profits shown in the table are not net
earnings. The £11,136 for the past year was
the surplus of revenue over working and
administrative exes., but £5OOO of it went
into a “special purposes and depreciation
fund” and, incidentally, during the period
£4112 was struck off this reserve. Actually,
therefore, the net profit claimed by the
accounts was £6136, but whether £5OOO for
depreciation, etc., was a fair charge against
the year’s operations is doubtful. For the
previous year only £3500 was provided. The
accounts make it clear that the co had a
good run, and the directors throw a bouquet
to the management: there "-ere further wage
increases and the cost of coal advanced, but
“efficient management obviated the necessity
to increase the price of gas.” A satisfactory
market ruled for residuals, and apparently
extra customers helped turnover; conse-
quently revenue increased by 23 p.c. This
shows how revenue-account figures have
advanced, the outgoings including the depre-
ciation allowances:—

During the year there wer2 considerable
additions to works, etc., their book value
having moved from £105,966 to £119,125
after an unusually large depreciation cut had
been made. A new carbonising unit was
almost completed and a subsidiary gas-
holder is. going up.. These w«rks put a strain
on the co., and though £5368 of new capital
was got in and £3700 more was borrowed,
the, excess of all other liabilities over and
above liquid assets after payment of the
final div. was £5031, compared with £2503
12 months ago. The position has since been
eased by a call of Is. 6d. on the contribs.

The Land Mortgage Bank talked in millions
m the boom days: paid capital was a
quarter-million and the management was
working on nearly a million of outside
money. Nowadays total funds amount to
£116,000. Though the old name-plate still
remains, actually the concern is out of busi-
ness so far as its old shareholders are con-
cerned. The Freehold Assets Co. some years
ago bought in at 12s. per share arid made a
call on itself of 2s. 6d. per share to shove
things along. There are 145,770 shares of
38s. paid to 10s. 6d. and these arc the assets:

One of the items —debts dne other than on

is somewhat obscure. If all lines are worth
full book value, there are net assets of
£119.640 to represent the £105,688 which
the Freehold Assets apparently paid for the
business and put up in calls. Meantime it
has had nearly 6 n.c. p.a. on its money. So
though the purchasing co. lias visibly not
grown fat from the deal it is probably not
sorry that it acquired the old boom derelict.

In the circular issued by the National
Bank inviting subscriptions to the new share
issue, the offer to the Queensland Bank share-
holders appeared as a “P.S.” to the infor-
mation set down for National holders. At
first glance it appeared that the Queensland
offer was portion of the half-million
increase of capital announced in a bold-
type headline. Actually the Queensland
issue is independent of the other. But
that makes no appreciable difference to
the offer to Queensland Bank shareholders
discussed by the “Wild Cat” last week. The
£l4O asked for a £l6O share interest will
turn in 7 1-7 p.c. on alO p.c. div. basis. If
all the Northern bank’s holders take up the
shares offered, which is unlikely, the
National’s funds will be increased in this
way:—
Capital. Reserves.
Present ..£2,000,000 | Mar., ’2l . . £1,376,625
National issue 500,000 | Premium . . 100,000
Queensland issue 225,000 I Premium . . 90,000
|
Total ..£2,725,000 j £1,566,625
That would give approximately £4,291,000
of shareholders’ funds, or about £l5B for
every £l4O asked of the Queensland holder.
That, of course, is apart from any interest in
internal reserves, additions to which, the
directors state, have been made from time to
time.

Commonwealth Life Assurance So-
ciety, Ltd.—-This was one of the 1920 crop
of new life concerns. It was a cleaner float
than most: not only was its promoter less
grasping than others in the matter of share
interest, but he also undertook to clip
into his own pocket for legal exes.,
registration costs and printing charges.
Though they are only an incidental
in the cost of getting a life office
through its birth and teething, they meant,
in this case, that the promoter put up cash
representing nearly one-sixth of his gift
shares. The public was invited to take up
11/0,000 £1 shares, but subscriptions were
slow and cost a lot to get. Since incorpora-
tion (August 24, 1920) to Dec. 31 last
63,033 shares were applied for and £5124
went in brokerage and commission to get
tnem, equal to Is. 7d. per share. Polic3 r-
writing was commenced at the beginning of
last year, but expenses began 16 months ago,
and the current accounts carry all charges
over that period. There is no attempt to
mask initiatory difficulties; instead of
opening an establishment account and
debiting it with a third or more of the year’s
costs as most young offices do, the C.L.A.
management includes all outgoings in its
revenue account.
The office had the offer of 3142 policies
assuring £199,070, and the business accepted
and still effective at December 31 was carry-
ing an annual premium income of £7470.
Ihe policies had been in force varying terms,
so when the accounts were made up only
£4255 had been received in premiums—£1770
from Ordinary policies, £2453 from Indus-
trial, and the balance of £32 from Guarantee
business and re-assurances. But the 16
months’ working and establishment exes,
took £7719, commissions £5632 and share-
issue costs £5124. So to December 31 a
deficit of £14,219 bad piled up. That is
nothing unusual in the first year of a life
office, but it means that, at the balance, to
represent the £18,301 put up by shareholders
and £4255 of premiums paid in by policy-
iu) I dor s, there were tangible assets' of oidv
£4415. £496 worth of stationery—and an
organisation. Everything, from shareholders’
point of view, now depends on what that
costly organisation can do. In its first
year there was not a single claim. The
management also declares that care was
taken to avoid doubtful risks, and from th*
beginning the co. says it has closely adhered'
to. tables compiled by a well-known actual-v
A. - S - Mbdfenden. What funds the C.L.A..
should have been holding at December 31
for the protection of policy-holders is not
ascertainable. The resources of the co. were
certainly meagre : as shown above there was
only at the outside, £4415 within more or
less, handv roach, and £44.732 of uncalled
camta., which is not by any means a depend-
able backing for policies shoiild things go
wrong. The position has since been im-

Westonia (W.A.) is at the last gasp. The
Central mine is now swamped as completely
as the Edna May. Granite has come in at
the bottom level (800 ft.) in Deeps, and that
co. proposes to cease development, extract
all available ore and quit. So the obsequies
of Westonia can be prepared. Edna May
was an excellent producer, but the fact that
the field was not worked as a single show
has been one of the tragedies of Westralian
mining. Hundreds of thousands of pounds’
worth of bullion have been won from the
Edna May Central and the Deeps, but the
dividends paid were only made possible by
selling reserve shares. ’ While Edna May
pumps were working and unwatering the
field to the common benefit of all the mines,
the prospects of Central and Deeps looked
fair, but anybody with half an eye could
see than the workings of these two proper-
ties would be flooded when the Edna May
pumps ceased to run, following the extrac-
tion of all available ore in that mine. At
the outset Edna May directors showed little
foresight when they failed to acquire, as
they had a chance of doing on extremely
cheap terms, both the Central and Deeps.
Later, the managements of the three mines
behaved like quarrelsome children and failed
to agree on a joint pumping scheme. Cen-
tral and Deeps also blundered badly when
they failed to arrange to secure the Edna
May mainshaft for pumping piirposes on
the big show ceasing operations. Westonia
was a bright spot for some years in West-
ralian mining, and, if the directors and
mine managers had got together and' over-
come the water problem, the field would pro-
bably still be thriving and anything up to a
quarter-million would have been saved. jEven
at this stage it is tragic that no means can
be devised to extract profitably the large
amount of gold remaining in the Central
mine.

Queensland Mines Minister’s proposed pow-
wow with the Cloncurrv copper-producers as
to ways and means of getting the mines going
(lid not eventuate. Hampden, the only co.
doing any development work, declined the
invitation with thanks. The reason was
that the Minister had declared for a reduc-
tion in everything except wages. So the
Cloncurry district remains stagnant, except
for a little development work at the Trekelano
and at a few gcuger shows. Many of the
latter are subsidb -d by the State, and with
this assistance contrive to pick the eyes out
of ‘ potentially rich shows to enable them to
send small parcels of 25 to 30 p.c. ore to
Chillagoe for treatment. Even this rich ore
returns very little over wages-—the stuff has
to be railed 400 miles —-and posterity is being
robbed of future mines. It would be a better
policy to issue rations rather than subsidies,
and preserve some of these mines from spolia-
tion.

The Dobbyn (Cloncurry) party that took
up the Silver Ridge, near Mt. Cuthbert, and
on the strength of some good assays had
, the Government tape run over it, have, on
present appearances, a tantalising prospect.
The lode is a zone of very crushed slate
slap up against porphyries, by which it has
evidently been impregnated with gold, lead,
silver and arsenic. The width of impreg-
nated slate is not less than 60ft., and, for
all anyone knows, may be much greater.
.Anyway, that is what it looks like on the
face of work done, consisting of a couple
of 50ft. shafts and several shallow trenches.
Assays by Jack Tregenza, Government
assayer at Cloncurry, indicate that the ore
to 50ft. averages 4dwt. to sdwt. gold, and
carries anything up to 20oz. silver. The
galena is patchy, and average values can-
not be judged from the lead assays so far
put through. The arsenic looks more like a
burden than a profit; there is not enough
to warrant furnaces and flues for saving
it. However, in a low-grade sulphide ore
4dwt. gold is a great standby, and on
account of its size the show looks as if
it has a chance to run to something really
big if development is taken in hand. It
means big capital, though, for, apart from
underground expenditure, there are water
and treatment plant to be provided.
A show like this would be rushed near
cheap fuel and fluxes, but its isolate.d posi-
tion is making the holders think furiously.,
* * * *
The closing of the big mine drove many of
the Mt. Morgan miners to prospect for gold,
but after about eight months’ work, chiefly
on old x r eins worked 30 to 40 years ago,
nothing worth mentioning has turned up.
The gold is there, but the country is appa-
rently too hard and unfissured for the veins
to make any size, most of them not exceeding
6in. in width. Still the miners keep going,
backed by assistance from the Mines Depart-
ment, and it looks a guinea to a gooseberry
that the State has said good-bye to most of
the cash.
The Sundown arsenic mine, Stanthorpe
(Q.), which amalgamated with the Comet
early last year, is jogging along satisfac-
torily, although the State mine has closed
down. Development has exceeded expec-
tations : the ore proved so far averages 15
p.c. arsenic, and there are 1500 tons of it
in the top level alone. There has been
trouble in separating copper and fine tin,
and a flotation plant is to be erected to
keep the copper out of the slimes. There is
a small silver by-product which is caught
in the copper matte. An air-compressor
plant and machine drills are to be installed,
air-compressor plant and machine drills.
The co. lately lost its manager, J. W. Ash-
croft, by death.
* * * *
Tributors in the old Vulcan, at Irvine-
bank (N.Q.), have struck a rich shoot at
the 600 ft. level, and the co. would welcome
a go-slow strike, as the tribute does not
expire till the end of this month. About
120 tons 10 p.c. ore a month is being ex-
tracted. Prospecting between 600 ft. and
950 ft. levels has not revealed anything of
note lately, and it looks as if the old show
will never come back to anything like its
pre-war eminence.
* * * *
Scottish Gympie (Q.) has gone so far to
leeward in recent years that the directors
are considering a reconstruction. There are
600,000 £1 fully-paids and 60,000 paid to
17s. 6d., 2s. 6‘d. having been got in from the
contribs. in 1914. The directors now pro-
pose to call up the balance (£7500), and
then write down assets and otherwise
straighten out the financial fighting-front.

Blair Athol (Q.) coalfield’s recovery from
its distressing slump has been long retarded,
but December and January returns show
improvement: the output of the preceding
months was nearly doubled. The recovery
has been due to northern orders which were
formerly placed with Mt. Mulligan.

Curie, Bellot, and the crowd who collect
royalties from Minerals Separation, Ltd.,
and its subsidiaries, are active in London
just now. Broken Hill having been idle,
nothing has come from that quarter; but
the co. has interests in Spain, Italy and
Belgium, and is dipping into nitrate deposits,
testing a new ore-reduction process, and
going into the possibilities of applying flota-
tion for converting low-grade and fine coal
into clean briquettes. Even if trade Ims
been stagnant the co.’s industry is without
end, but whence all the cash comes to keep
the pot boiling is a mystery. The ’Murkan
end of the business, though, has a vampire
reputation for screwing out royalties. The
hard things said may be responsible for the
charter pinned up in London board-room;
“The principle which guides us is that we:
should obtain in exchange for the knowledge
which we impart only such reasonable pay-
ment as the producers, by the use of our
new processes or inventions, can afford to
pay.” What isn’t set out in this declaration
of rights is whether the co. fathers the
precious clause appearing in certain patent
licenses that any discovery or improvement
made during the use of the patent must
belong to its owners, even though they had
no hand in the improvement.

Shale Petrol Oil has abandoned its scheme
of floating the three-quarter million Oil
Shale Products and Coal Ltd., which was
to tackle old .Toadja and the adjoining
Reedy Creek shale deposits, near Mittagong
(N.S.W.). Instead, the promoting co. pro-
poses to increase its own paid capital of
£15,000 by offering 120,000 new 10s. shares.
With the new capital it intends to erect re-
torts with a capacity of 80 tons per day,
develop reserves and also establish the
extent of available shale. In view of the .
doubts cast on the enterprise, and particu-
larly on the extent of the payable shale
left by the long-defunct A. Iv. O. Co., the
directors decided to obtain a further inde-
pendent report. This time they called in
Harley Hooper, of Melbourne School of
Mines. He has reported, fully on old and
new workings, and says that “it is fairly
certain that there are. some hundreds of
thousands of tons available, from present
indications.” And as to quality, “the average
of the samples taken gives 68gal. oil per
ton.” Hooper was evidently ‘impressed;
he talks of the advisability of repairing the
old A.K.O. railway permanent-way for a
start, and suggests consideration later on
of piping the oil direct to the sea-board —
Dapto is only 34 miles away. The big
float having collapsed, the little Shale Petrol
Oil can only dream of pipe-lines and other
expensive works. Its job will be to estab-
lish definitely the extent of the shale still
remaining at old .Toadja and the prospects
at near-by Reedy Creek.

Vegetable Creek g.-m. Atkinson in reply:
I cannot agree that my description (B. 26/l/’22)
of the Vegetable Creek lead in any way confirms
Mr. J. M. Newman’s views on alluvial tin deposition
(B. 19/l/’22).
During the exploitation of the 2f miles of lead by
this co., slightly over 10 miles of driving and cross-
cutting were done, practically all on the slate bottom
or in it, and throughout there "'as no trace of
porphvry dyke or lode: one would expect to find
some 'trace of the dykes even if the lodes had been
long since denuded, though there is no reason at
all for the latter to have disappeared completely.
Some remnants would surely have been left ; also
the driving done would have run across some indica-
tion of the contact zone connecting the two slate
ends of the lead, if it was handy enough to have been
the source of the tin.
Mr. Newman seems to me to beg the whole question
when he states that I interpret his views too nar-
rowly—the tin has either travelled in accord with
my views, or has remained near its source to agree
with his. Altogether 1700 tons oxide were won here
which I firmly believe has, travelled at least 2% miles,
and sufficient driving in the adjoining rim rock was
done to have located some trace of any possible
closer source.
Professor David, in his “Geology of the Vegetable
Creek Tin Mining Field,” published in 1887, in dis-
cussing the possibilities of this lead, wrote as
follows: —•
From Bailey’s (the point at which the porphyry
cuts out) to Gordon’s cultivation paddock, a dis-
tance of over four miles, as the rim rocks are barren,
the richness of the lead will depend on the amount
of tin drifted from the porphyry which ceases at
Bailey’s. At Barry’s [about 200 yards down the
lead from Vegetable Creek workings], 170 chains
west of Bailey’s, there is still sufficient tin in the
gravel to make its working remunerative: much of
Barry’s wash yielded lcwt. of ore to the cubic y& r( l,
and the grains were fairly coarse, so that 1 thinK
the lead ought to continue payable for another mile.
Things are parlous with Bendigo Amalga-
mated (Vic.). Carlisle is less promising,
the two Nelson reefs are blanks, Constella-
tion is not showing up over-well, and the
Northern and Virginia mines won t make
better. Prospecting at Monument Hill has
yielded nothing more tangible than blighted
hopes, for, while one lot of 369 tons aver-
aged 7dwt., other fortnightly yields gave
only 4dwt., which, with the smaller gold
premium, is not good enough. Saddest of
all, the 1440 ft. winze at the Hercules, which
went down in fair-grade quartz, carried in
it all the enrichment. The shoot of stone
is so big—2oft. thick, 200 ft. high and 200 ft.
long—that it will be prodded into further,
but so far it) is more the cause of sorrow
than of joyous hope. The big show s luck
being out, and with wages where they are,
Dyason intends to spend only limited sums
on prospecting: it is not to be on a scale
that will jeopardise cash resources. It
returns slide lower the brake will go on hard.
Dyason’s latest quarterly report is the gloom-
iest he has penned since he moulded Central
Bendigo into its present form.

Harry Hartrick, looking after the lease at
Walhalia (Vic.) under option to the Over-
seas Exploration Syndicate, got on to
a 3ft. reef with a dyke footwall
and a slate hanging wall, and pro-
claims it is a continuation of Cohen s
famed Long Tunnel reef. Seeing the claim
is to the west of the Long Tunnel line, more
evidence than similarity of appearance is
necessary to establish such a claim. Even
if the stone be a part of Cohen’s reef, a run
of 6dwt. ore in a shaft is nothing out of the
way with Walhalia gold worth only £3 12s.
6d. an ounce. Round the north shaft the
country is all smashed up, so that a good
sample or two cannot count as much. At the
middle shaft solid, ground is being entered,
and wqrk there will soon tell a tale. Hart-:
rick’s recommendation is to spend a bit in
putting in a tunnel to cut the reef under
the north shaft, and so test the formation in
solid ground. Having gone so far, the Over-
seas Syndicate wants to finish the job; but
if it gets a bit of gold on the crosscut it had
better think twice before adopting Hartrick’s
idea of planking a battery on the claim.
Time enough when some ore reserves have
been opened up.
The trouble in the Vic. State coal-mine,
caused bv the irresponsible youthful
wheelers, didn’t last long. General-manager
Broome, having secured the backing of the
Railway Commissioners, who, under an Act
of Parliament, control the mine, stood firm,
and the miners, who had been holding stop-
work meetings and (on the quiet) cursing the
wheelers with their full vocabulary, inti-
mated after a few days that they were ready
to. start afresh on the management’s terms.
The hold-up moved Treasurer McPherson to
remark that if the public had the idea that
nationalisation of industries prevented
strikes they ought no longer to hug the delu-
sion, as he thought there had been more
strikes at the State mine at Wonthaggi than
at any other colliery in the Commonwealth.

As expected, the monopoly established
by the Speck Government to buy osmiri-
dium is not panning out too well.
All private buyers have been de-licensed,
and competition for the metal has
ceased. In December private buyers
were giving £lB per oz. spot cash;
the Government scheme, as expounded by
its advocates, was to return £27 at least —
£lB on delivery to agent, the balance on sale.
The digger now finds his advance is only £l2,
and that final settlements are problematical.
All metal now handled by the agent is subject
to a second weighing, grading and valuation •
formerly the private buyer had to take his
chance. Another unexpected development
has been the combination of foreign con
sumers, and that looks like the end of com-
petitive buying. In any case, with the in-
ferior Russian metal available at £l2 per
oz., the Speck diggers can’t hope for thp
good old prices.

The Linton prospecting syndicate has de-
cided to form a co. to open up the recently-
discovered gold lode near Scottsdale (Tas )
Capital is to be in 220 shares of £lO each, and
the vendors take no less than 120 fully-paids
A 12-ton trial crushing returned 2730 z
from a lode averaging about one foot wide
What is supposed to be a continuation of
the Linton lode has been exposed, and an-
other co. of 100 £lO shares is being formed
to open up that holding. Assays going from
4oz. to lloz. have been reported, and there
is quite a boom in the agricultural district

Mick O’Keefe, the persistent and per-
suasive Labor member who declines to
acknowledge that the glory of his native
Beaconsfield departed for ever, when the old
Tasmania gold-mine closed down, has in-
duced the Tas. Assembly to risk £l5OO to
£2OOO on a small experimental asbestos mill
to treat the patchy deposits around Beacons-
field. There is a string to the proposal in
the condition that Mines Department experts
must give the project a hope of commercial
success before the mill is erected; but as a
strong party of working miners is said to
be willing to lease the mill at a rental suffi-
cient to secure the Government against loss,
business may result.
* ' * *
“Awaruite”: One aspect of the re-bpen-
ing of the Beaconsfield (Tas.) asbestos de-
posits has apparently been lost sight of in
the recent discussion on the advisability of
erecting a State crushing mill there. There
is said to be a £lO,OOO order offering from
Sydney, but why did a N. S. Wales crowd
abandon the show on the termination of the
war and after they had produced several
thousand tons of fibre?

Christian Rudolf de Wet, who fought
against the British in three wars, died at
Bloemfontein the other day, irreconcilable
to the last. A slick commando leader with
the virtues and failings of the backveldt
Boer, De Wet was the newspaper hero of tile
second S’African disturbance, but never
showed any of Botha’s talent for directing
large bodies of troops. He was a mere par-
tisan chief who had the luck to play his part
before the automobile became serviceable.
When he tried to repeat his 1902 successes
in 1914 a handful of persistent persons in
motor-cars rounded him up in a few weeks.
Charles Henry Goode, Adelaide’s oldest
merchant and most industrious philanthro-
pist, has reached the foot of the hill. A
Herefordshire man, he came to S. Aus. in
1849, being then 22, and made his first rise
as a hawker of drapery. Selling his horse
and cart he opened a shop, and that led to
the establishment of the big softgoods busi-
ness that bears his name. In 1865 Goode
entered Parliament as M.L.A. for East
Torrens, but quitted it within a year, con-
vinced that politics wasn’t his game. Busi-
ness, church (he was a Baptist) and charity
were his three main interests in life. He
was twice married—the first time in 1856;
the second in 1890 —but there are no young
Goodes to inherit what he didn’t give away
in half-a-century of well-doing.
THUJSFIELD, the Springbok cyclist, now
touring Australia and M.L. with a
S’African team. of athletes.
The man in Australia who most felt the
news of Shackleton’s death was probably
Captain John King Davis, chief officer on
the Nimrod in the 1907-09 expedition.
Davis, who had some stirring adventures
during the war as a transport commander,
is now Commonwealth Director of Naviga-
tion. He was at Willis Island, supervising
the erection of the new wireless station
which _is to give notice of approaching
cyclonic disturbances, when the news came
through. But he would share his sorrow
with ex-Captain Frederick Evans, who took
command of the Nimrod when its original
skipper resigned on returning to Maoriland
after landing the explorers on Ross Island.
Evans was then in charge of one of the
Union Co.’s boats. After the war, in which
he, too, had adventures, he forsook the
sea for the law, and is now a member of the
N. S. Wales Bar.
Shand, Iv.C., who is taking a 12 months’
trip abroad, will pass by another chance
tor a Judgeship. Bring will be due to retire
in the middle of the year. Shand has been
mentioned in regard to every vacant judge-
ship for years; but apparently he has no
thought of yet surrendering the more profit-
u 11 wol 'j a Bar-leader. Some day we
shall grade our Judges’ pensions. At present
there is no special inducement for the com-
paratively young barrister to go on the
Bench. He will get the same pension if he
steps up a few years later.
Brig.-General Lloyd is back from Quetta,
India, where he went for a 15-months’ course
at the military-staff college. He will again
specialise in artillery in the Commonwealth
permanent forces. State politicians take a
special interest in him, as he is the only
son of Sergeant Lloyd, who was orderly to
several Premiers
and accompanied
George Turner to
England i n 1897
when Queen Vic.
was celebrating her
diamond jubilee.
“Ted” Grayndler
has just been re-
elected after his
biggest fight, as
A.W.U. gen. secre-
tary, and is “tipped”
as first official head
of the 0.8. U. now
being born, with
much travail, in
Sydney. Grayndler
is also campaign
director of the
movement to in-
duce trade union-
ists of the Com-
monwealth to pay
10s. each as capi-
tal for a chain of
Labor dailies.
Whatever he isn’t,
he is a staunch
“Australian first.”

Hugh Victor McKay, the new master of
Rupertswood. baronial hall of our first
Baronet, is Victorian-born. A large, meaty
man profusely laid down in sandy hair and
freckles, he looks like the prosperous pro-
prietor of a bush pub. He began as a manu-
facturer in Ballarat some 30 years ago,
but did not make much of a hit in his initial
effort. After rearrangement he got going once
more, and a timely adventure in the Argen-
tine proved the real beginning of a career
that may be said to have reached its climax
at Rupertswood. Having some hundreds
of harvesters which the local demand could
not instantly swallow, the McKays (there is
a drove of them under the command of the
masterful Hugh) hired a ship, and packed
the raft off to S. America, where the
machines sold like sweep-tickets do in Syd-
ney. He has not since looked back, and
probably his. sole remaining regret is that
the Clarke title does not go with the right
to Rupertswood.
Denis Gaynor D’Arcy, who succeeded
McCauley as N.S.W. Comptroller-General of
Prisons, had a unique tribute paid him at
his funeral last week. Among the mourners
were at least a dozen people who had been
under his charge at Long Bay. One, an old
woman, wept hysterically at the graveside,
sobbing that she had lost her only friend. It
is strange for a gaol governor to be popular,
but D’Arcy fhanaged to be that.
On a little man and a lot of luck : ‘
Win-tie-OV-wrangle seems to be the governing prin-
ciple in Labor selection-ballots and the like where
little Paddy Minahan is concerned. Last year he
was cast out of the party and hurriedly readmitted ;
this year he was beaten in the ballot and promptly
re-selected by the A.L.P. executive. Minahan’s luck
in this respect began at Belmore years ago. E. W.
O’Sullivan had held the seat for some time without
Labor opposition; but when he died there was. a
scramble for what was rightly regarded as a soft
thing. On the vote of the Belmore Labor League
Aid. John English scored; but the Labor executive,
of which Minahan was then president, resolutely
stepped in. It declared the ballot irregular and the
protesting League bogus, and presented the nomina-
tion to Minahan. Followed a bitter election, for
English stuck to his guns, but the boot-manufacturer
won. English stayed in the City Council and voted
consistently for Labor measures; but not having
Minahan’s pull, he was never pardoned. Although
a bootmaker by occupation Paddy’s first appearance
in the Labor world was as a delegate of the Musi-
cians’ Union. His political opposition to Piute hasn't
prevented him from making money. Twenty years
ago he and his brother ran a bootshop in Hunter-
street,- -Sydney, facing present police headquarters.
To-day they own a big factory and have other inter-
ests of the most substantial kind.
G. W. Anthony, who lately resigned his
post as Registrar-General of Deeds in South
Aus., and has since died, will always be
remembered for his unsparing condemnation
of slipshod work. Solicitors and land-
agents might get annoyed and talk of “techni-
calities” when they found a batch of docu-
ments turned back because the. occupation of
an unimportant witness in one of them had
been omitted. But to Anthony, as to Judge
Boucaut in older days, either a thing was the
law or it wasn’t; if it was it had to be com-
plied with. Blackwell succeeds him.
“P.P.”: Sydney has a herbalist who was
once a medical officer in the Russian Army.
While stationed on the borders of Man-
churia, he came across an English journalist
who had been arrested as a spy, ordered the
removal of his chains, and ultimately
secured his release. Not long ago he was
in the Lismore (N.S.W.) district, and
called, w'ith a letter of introduction, on the
proprietor of a local paper—one Seymour.
Tie was surprised to have flung at him
"Where were you in 1869?” Seymour, now
old but still vigorous, was the journalist of
the chains of 53 years ago.
Manly (N.S.W.) lost its best-known iden-
tity by the death of “Sovereign” Smith last
week. Smith, whose Christian name was
William, was gipsydiorn, bolted to sea as a
youngster, and then went into the fish-curing
business. Twenty years ago he landed in
Sydney from M.L. with some tons of cured
fish, and with the proceeds of the sale he
started merry-go-rounds in Manly. They
turned him in big profits, which he put into
land, and that turned him in more. He used
to wear sovereigns as buttons—hence the
name by which lie -was known to every
youngster who visited the Village when ,he
ran his hurdy-gurdies there. \
As The Bulletin expected, Gellibrand
has thrown up his job as Vic. Chief of
Police. He was never happy in it, and the
Dawson Ministry, which shakes hands with
itself twice a week upon the success of its
appointments, has long thought that it was
unwise in allowing the Argus to rush it into
picking the soldier-man. Handicapped by
lack of knowledge of (1) Vie. law and prac-
tlce ’ X 2) of the topography of the State,
and (3) of the men serving under him. he
had an uphill job ; and then, when he had
surmounted those difficulties (in part), he
didn’t find the atmosphere congenial. Added
to that his orchard in the Speck was going
to pot, though that was a minor consider-
ation. George Steward, his predecessor,
was just about full of the job when an acci-
dent caused his heart to stop suddenly. He
was after the State Public Service Commis-
sionership, and hoped to succeed Morrison in
May this year.
A line from Colonel Bruxner, M.L.A.,
organiser of the N.S.W. Cocky party:—
No, I’m not a Warwick (Q.) boy (B. 2/2/’22). I
was born at Sandilands, on the Clarence River, and
so far have stuck to this State right through, and
will do so until wa get a new one in the North. I
left on service with the 6th L.H., not the 6th; but
that’s near enough—they were in the same , brigade.
“Lex” : D. G. D’Arcy, N. S. Wales Comp-
troller-General of Prisons, who died last
week, was the new style of gaoler. He
showed me over Parramatta Gaol when lie
was governor there, and stopped to bestow
a word of praise on the efforts of a little old
Chinese who was working in the garden.
“What’s he in for?” I asked. “Murder,” he
said ; “yet he’s one of the most decent men
we have.” An A.I.F. “hard case,” com-
menting on the insulting disciplinary
methods of an ex-n.c.o. (Permanent Forces)
who had been promoted to field-rank,
observed: “They want to put him under a
cove like D’Arcy to learn him to boss a man
like a gentleman.” .
Captain Longmore, who has written the
history of his fighting battalion, the 44th,
is president of the Perth branch of the Re-
turned Soldiers’ League. Modest to a
degree, he never refers to his share in the
operations, but he came back with the
French War Cross and the Belgian Order
of Leopold. After a youth spent in the
Westralian rnulga he joined the citizen army
and, when war broke out, was area-officer
at Coolgardie. An expert in machine-gun-
nery—the onlv one in his State—he trained
the splendid machine-gun sections that went
from Groperland, and made himself so use-
ful in this respect that he wasn’t allowed
to go to the Front until he threatened to
desert and enlist as a private under an
assumed name. Yet when he returned, with
a brilliant record of service in the 1917
and 1918 campaigns, his field rank was
taken from him, and he was made junior to
boys who had never left Australia. Driven
out of the forces by this damphoolishness
Longmore is now helping F. R. L ee to run
a bright Perth weekly, the Australian.
D. H. HARVEY, the head of Tatt.’s
nowadays.
William Archer, who was , 91 on Feb. 8.
was an amiable but undistinguished mem-
ber of the Ma State’s Leg. Assembly from
1898 till 1904, and he was for 47 years an
alderman of Burwood (Sydney). ' As his
.entry into Parliament took place close upon
his 70th year, he can be forgiven for not
making his career there sensational. Start-
ing life as a page-boy, riper jmars found him
owning businesses and racehorses.
A. W. Green, who has had more to do with
“State children” than any other man in Aus-
tralia, has said good-bye to his old job after
50 years’ public service in X. S. Wales.
From time that/goes back beyond the memory
of man he has been a boarding-out officer,
and. when Dr. Charles Mackellar ceased his
official connection with the Department Green
became chairman of the Board that fathers
the State infant., When not keeping an
eye on the infant he was mostly to be found
on the cricket ground, or at the governing
council of one of the big athletic games.
To spy out the way they do it in Europe
and America, M. P. Hansen, chief inspector
of secondary schools in Vic. Education Dept.,
is off. on tour for nine months. Originally a
training-school youth, Hansen threw up
State-school work and went to Wesley Col.
for lO'years as a master. Tate snared him
back to his present post, and it is an open
secret that he is marked out to be Tate’s
successor as Director of Education. As
Hansen is only 48 he can wait a couple of
years and still be merely middle-aged when
the big job comes his way.
“A Northerner” from Cattle Vale:—
Bulletins are never destroyed out here (N.Q.), and
the other day in an 18-months-old one that is still
doing the rounds I came across a par in which mining-
engineer Darley, writing of the possibilities of the
Bowen-Mackay hinterland, stated that Jim Heenan,
the discoverer of Mount Britten, was dead. In dis-
proof of it the same day old Jim turned up here, hale
and hearty, and straight as a gun-barrel. He had
come across this same hinterland from Mackay,
where he had been to see his dying - sister. The old
fellow (he must be nearly four-score) still seeks the
yellow metal. He carries a very small matilda, and
bandicoot, goanna, ’possum and even carpet-snake
eke out his menu. Jim seems good for many years
yet, and is an appalling example of how this awful
N. Queensland keeps heading a man off from the
Pearly Gates.
An inheritance of easily-broken bones has
come the way of young Reginald Heiler, son
of Australia’s champion brittle man. The
elder Heiler, who now lives at Gilgandra
(N.S.W.), first struck fame as a bone-breaker
years ago, and has to date suffered from 44
fractures: he once broke a leg by merely
stepping off a pavement. Heiler, junior,
only 12 years old, has now achieved his tenth
break. A dog, jumping on his bed, landed
on the boy’s leg, and the bone went.
One Rufe Naylor is disputing the pre-
eminence of A. G. Huie as Sydney’s most
chronic . writer of letters to ' the' editor.
Na.vlor is a fluent and smooth-faced Queens-
lander who made a pot of money in West-
ralia by punting and promoting footraces.
Arthur Postle and Donaldson, “the Blue
Streak, being two of his stars. Migrating
to Johannesburg, he became the Wren of
those parts, owning two racecourses; and he
got into the Town Council. But, falling foul
of the Botha Government, he moved on to
Delagoa Bay and ran sweeps there until the
Transvaal authorities squelched the enter-
prise by refusing him the use of the mails.
After that Naylor decided there was no place
like home.
THE RESTLESS LEGION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
being- the wish of his widow, Sir Ernest
Shackleton will be buried at South Georgia, within
the Ant? retie circle.”
Some in the desert sleep,
Some in the white-ice region,
They of the roving race,
They of the restless legion.
Forth from their hearths they fared.
Fronting with souls unfrightened
Wastes that no foot had pressed,
Waters no keel had whitened.
Fated and famed they passed,
Facing their doom uncowering—•
Fog and the red mirage
Dreamer and dream devouring.
O’er them the eagle soars,
O’er them the grey wave races ;
They of the shipless seas,
They of the desert places.

Society
“Skipper”: At Anzae I was present in
Brown’s Dip one morning to hear the promul-
gation of a field-general court-martial. The
prisoner, a youngster of about 18, who had
been found asleep at his post in a front-line
trench, marched jauntily 6n to parade, a
fair-headed, irresponsible baby. The adju-
tant cleared his throat: “Proceedings of a
field-general court-martial. ... We find the
accused guilty, and sentence him to be shot.”
The poor little devil collapsed, and his escort
had to hold him up. “‘I concur in the find-
ing of the Court,’ ” the adjutant continued
to read, “ ‘but reduce the sentence to 15 years’
penal servitude.’ Signed Dash Dash, Briga-
dier-General. ‘I concur in the finding of the
Court, but reduce the sentence to 10 years’
penal servitude.’ Signed Blank Blank, Major-
FIRST AID.
ITS WIFE : “I can think of nothing but that
hat I saw to-day.”
ITSELF: “Try thinking about the price for
a change.”
General.” The kid perked up a bit. “‘I
concur in the finding of the Court, but re-
duce the sentence to. two years’ imprison-
ment with hard labor.’ Signed lan Hamil-
ton, General.’'’ And the poor little beggar
nearly jumped for joy. They sent him to
Malta to work out his sentence, but he peti-
tioned the Governor there for another chance,
and two months later he was returned to
duty, one of the keenest soldiers who ever
wore khaki. And then one morning Jacko
sent over a shell with his number on it.

“Macquarie Street” on a hero’s passing:—
The lives of men who suffer from angina pectoris,
or aneurism of the aorta, hang upon a hair. True
angina is rare, but there are a host of colorable
imitations, which the general practitioner meets
with frequently in nervous women, and these are,
as a rule, easily curable, being due to stomach or
nerve trouble. Aneurism of the aorta is the bane
of medical prc.ctice, being often undiagnosed by the
tyro, sometinnss even by the expert, and then the
Government pathologist or the pathologist at a hos-
pital is left to clear up matters. Perhaps Sir
Ernest Shackleton was aware of his condition, and
decided to take the risk. I have known a case
of that kind; the patient, who was a doctor, knew
all about his malady, but carefully concealed the
matter from his family and friends. I signed the
certificate as angina pectoris (he died suddenly
without seeing a doctor), and a few days after-
wards some capsules of nitrite of amyl—-the usual
remedy for the disease—were discovered in his bag.
Angina pectoris is due to arterio-sclerosis, or organic
heart disease, or both, and the paroxysms of pain
from which it gets its name are due to thickening
of the walls of the coronary arteries which supply
the heart with blood. It avoids attacking, as a
rule, the horny-handed son of toil, but involves
mercilessly men who have distinguished themselves
mentally and physically. John Hunter, the famous
anatomist, and the no-less famous Arnold of Rugby
died from it. Perhaps the reason why it leaves
the man with the spade comparatively alone is be-
cause of a nervous element in it. The working man
takes life more easily, and doesn’t as a rule, worry
overmuch. A typical attack is characterised by a
pallor of the countenance, pain over the region of
the heart, often shooting down the left arm, and
a feeling of impending death. It may be suddenly
fatal, or may leave the victim a chronic invalid.
It will continue to take toll of the best and most
useful lives while they feel it their duty to burn
the candle at both ends.

“ELM.”: A local flood in Maoriland
recently put a section of the road to a coun-
try racecourse under water, and sports motor-
ing out to the meeting found an aged Maori
standing in the middle of the wetness. He
halted them, explained that a deep hole had
been washed out right in the fairway, and
pointed out just how, with careful driving,
they could avoid the danger. The old chap
was invariably passed a tip, and his Good
Samaritan act netted him somewhere about
£2O. When the flood went down one of the
motorists took a run out to see what sort
of a mess Hori had saved them from. The
road at the spot was as smooth as a billiard-
table.

“Cardos” : We were loading mules at Suez,
and the dag of the outfit was vainly trying
with violent contortions and more violent
language to get one of the long-eared curses
on to the boat when the padre happened
along. After watching the heated proceed-
ings for a moment he came forward and
asked, “Can I be of any assistance, Dig.?”
“Yes,” said the sweating Billiim. “Get your
little book out and see how th’ hell Noah got
two of these blankards aboard. One of ’em
is too much for me.”
* * * *
“Rounds”: Moved by sentimentality or
in search of an advt. (which he got), a
seasider whitewashed the spot in the ease-
ment off Gun Alley (M'elb.) where the nude
body of murdered Alma Tirtschke was found,
and placed flowers in a jam-tin there. Thou-
sands thronged the alley on Foundation Day,
and when tired of
gazing at that sor-
didness moved to
Eastern Arcade,
where the accused
man used to run a
wineshop. What-
ever was wanting
in thrills was sup-
plied on the way
home, when,
prompted by the
calls of the run-
ners, the explorers
bought evening
papers containing a
narrative of the
death by shooting
of Charles Tirt-
schke, the father
of Alma, at Maffra.
But on the avail-
able evidence this
looks like an acci-
dent.
From V. P. Taylor, whom Australia knew
as Captain Penfold, the balloonist (he
writes from California) :
While at Sydney it came to my mind what a great
benefit to the human race it would be if a human
eye could be transferred from a living person to
one deemed to be going blind. I wrote to Mr. H. R.
Miller, secretary of the Rugby Football League, and
offered to give free of charge one of my eyes to a
well-known Sydney personage who at that time was
expected to lose his sight. I asked Mr. Miller to
consult that personage’s oculists. Mr. Miller after-
wards told me that the oculists told him “it was
not possible.” I enclose a clipping re a German
of Berlin experimenting with animals. As I wish
my country, Australia, to get the prestige of the
great discovery of transference of a human eye to a
human being, I have offered as “an Australian’s New
Year’s gift to humanity” to give free of charge one
of my eyes for the oculists to transfer to a person
deemed to be going blind.
On this a specialist observes: —
The offer may be regarded as a joke or a tragedy
according to fancy. As an example of child-like
faith in ophthalmic surgery, and the crude, quasi-
seientific material that, for propaganda purposes, is
being poured out of Germany and! is being eagerly
swallowed by a sensational press, it takes the damper
so far as my knowledge goes —and I meet with as
many wild-cat medical notions as most people. The
German experiment upon which Mr. .. Taylor has
pinned his faith consists, it is reported, in blinding
fish, and afterwards restoring their vision by trans-
planting the healthy eyes of one of their scaly
brethren. But American oculists are not likely
A TRUE HELPMATE.
“They’re going to soak us for an increased
income-tax.”
“Don’t worry, dear. I’ll spend every penny
of it rather than let those robbers get it.”
to enthuse over Mr. Taylor’s offer. Transplantation
of portion of the freshly-enucleated human eyeball
(the cornea, or window of the eye, is the part used)
was long ago practised in ophthalmic surgery, but as
it was a failure, optically, owing to the part dying,
and so becoming entirely opaque, it has been practi-
cally scrapped. The job is easy enough, merely re-
quiring correct apposition, the maintenance of the
graft in position, and a bandage. In this little
operation the surgeon is dealing with a part which
has no blood-vessels ; but what success could he look
for when it came to adjusting muscles, nerves and
vessels, and uniting the transplanted optic nerve to
the one in situ? The blood-vessels, being very minute,
couldn’t be joined, so the retina would at once
perish. No one out of Bedlam w r ould dream of the
possibility of success.

“Dingo”: The Yankee song-writer who
asserted that Caruso was taken merely to
strengthen the Heavenly choir (B. 26/1/’22)
did not break new ground. Many years ago,
on Ellerlie station (N.S.W.), the senior bull-
ocky was taken desperately ill. The manager
suggested calling the assistance of both a
doctor and a parson. “It’d only be waste of
time, boss,” said the dying man. “God
A’mighty wants a good bullocky, and old
Dick Smith’s got to go.” He went.

The last of an old tabernacle: —
The old Grand View, opposite the Town Hall, Pad-
dington (Sydney), has come down, and a new pub
is to go up in its place. The old pub was in part
the original St. Matthias’s Church, which was built
for the use of the garrison. The first service was
held there on Feb. 17, 1856, a wedding took place
on March 24, and the first baptism on March 30.
But the place was not long used as a tabernacle: in
1857 a start was made with the present church, and
the old one presently became the dining- and billiard-
rooms and kitchen of a pub.
* * * *
“S.S.S.”: Apropos my story (told by a
parson’s wife) of her little child playing with
the “spirit” of another child, just dead, “Dr.
Nil” is mistaken in suggesting that the par-
son’s wife forgot to say that she had been
talking about the poor dead kid when her own
little four-year-old was listening. The par-
son’s wife is a fine, healthy, strong-minded
Scotch woman, with plenty of commonsense,
and she stressed the fact that, as the child
had died suddenly, after but a few hours’
sickness, and lest the sickness had been some-
thing catching, she had kept her own little
girl on an enclosed verandah on the other
side of the big old rectory, where she could
not possibly see or hear anything of what
was going on. And. of course, she did not
mention anything to her little girl about the
death. Neither of them had ever seen
the child who died. lam not by any means
“psychical” myself, yet the night my husband
was killed at Messines he came to me aboard
the Osterley and told me that he had passed
over. He also appeared to a sister in
America, whom he had not been in touch
with for many years. He said to her: “Look
after M ,” mentioning our little girl
then four months old, by name. She did
not know that he had a child. In a letter
to their mother in Scotland she described
him as wearing a dark-blue, well-fitting uni-
form, with a high silver badge on his cap.
“Hanno” on mixed marriages (B. 26/l/’22) :
Thirty years ago an absolutely white girl was born
in a blacks’ camp in N. S. Wales, the father being a
white man and the mother a quarter-
caste woman. Shortly after the birth
the mother died and the child passed
to the care of an ancient gin. The
local sergeant of police and his wife
were childless, and, sooner than see
a white girl grow up in such un-
savory surroundings, adopted her, the
usual legal forms being complied
with. Later the sergeant wa3 trans-
ferred to a distant part of the State,
and there he and his wife passed the
child off as their own. In the full-
ness of time he rose in the service,
and the girl grew into an exceedingly
beautiful young woman and married.
Her first child was a boy, and although
he was the usual pinky-white at birth
very soon he was a good black, and,
to make matters worse, he possessed
features of a distinctly Binghi type.
Naturally the husband said exactly
what he might have been expected to
say in the circumstances, and the
fullest disclosure of all the facts had
to be made. Later on, four other
children were born, two of them being
boys and two girls, and (a point over
which biologists may do a good deal
of chewing) all three boys were obvi-
ously of the aboriginal type, while
the girls were so fair that any sug-
gestion that they were not of the purest of white
strains would have been laughed at.
‘‘Land Boomer” : In 1837 the land on which
Scott’s Hotel, Melbourne, stands was sold
at a Government sale for £46, and upon it
was built the Lamb Inn. About 1850 the
name was changed to the Clarendon, and in
1850 to Scott’s* because Edward Scott took
it over. In 1868, W. C. Wilson, once pro-
prietor of the Mclvor Hotel at Maryborough,
bought it, and it still belongs to his family.
At the crest of our splendid land boom, on
May 31, 1888, W. C. Wilson sold the
property for £160,000 to a syndicate of five
citizens, who knew nothing whatever of pub-
keeping. The document makes romantic
reading. The hotel was bought as it stood,
pictures and personal effects; de-
posit £5OOO, balance of £40,000 in one month,
and a mortgage of £120,000 for 10 years at
6 per cent. The buyers were W. H. Croker,
Sam Gillott, Jonas Felix Levien, M.L.A.,
Thos. Fallon and David Syme. This syn-
dicate leased the hotel to several of the
employees, all well known to habituds. Then
the land boom got consumption, and declined
so rapidly that in 1893 W. C. Wilson re-
sumed possession 'of Scott’s, thus getting
£40,000 cash and his pub back. Meanwhile
ONE OR T’OTHER.
“He won’t let her come surfing. He must

her.”
“Or perhaps he's afraid no one will if they
see her in a i bathing costume.”
v.
Wilson had bought the Imperial Hotel and a
row of shops at the top of Bourke-street,
opposite Parliament House, for £llO,OOO, from
W. 11. B. Neill, of Bendigo, and, it is said,
lost on a re-sale the whole £40,000 he made
over the other transaction.

THE MUSICAL MACHINE-GUNNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Professor Gottstrafus is opposite me,
I know by his cute little ways;
There he stands in the trench with his old Emma Gee,
And tries to foreshorten my days.
“Rat, tat!” he begins; then it’s down with your
head,
Or he’ll have you as certain as Fate;
Oh, it’s fierce, and it’s sudden, his Anthem of Dread,
That sweet little hymn-tune of Hate.
Professor Gottstrafus is going on leave,
I know, and I count it a sin,
For soon he’ll be wiping the froth off his sleeve,
In the bier-gartens back in Berlin;
Yes, he’s thinking to-night of the thick, creamy foam
That floats on a long lager beer;
How he rattles it out —“Oh, it’s Home, Home,
Sweet Home,”
And the bullets crack close to my ear.
Professor Gottstrafus is snug in his grave,
I know, and the honor is mine,
For he settled for ever my old cobber Dave,
While playing “The Watch on the Rhine.”
I crawled through our wire, when the daylight had
fled,
Disdainful of dank mud that chills,
And I blew all the hair from the top of his head,
With the puff of a dear little Mills.

TOOHEY'S.
“Wilfrido": A M.L. husband recently
threatened his wife with divorce proceedings,
and in the meantime it was mutually agreed
that a deed of separation should be drawn
up. _ While the husband’s solicitor was dis-
cussing the terms at the office of the wife’s
.solicitor, he dropped the letters constituting
the basis of the divorce case—letters which
had been intercepted by the husband. When
he . had gone the incriminating missives,
which were the only available evidence of
misconduct, were found by the wife’s soli-
citor. Then this question confronted the latter :
should he, acting in the best interests of his
client, hand them h?mk to, her, or, as a matter
THE BRUTE,
“What would you do if you lost me ?”
“The same as you, of course?”
“Brute! You’d never get any one to marry
YOU again”
of professional etiquette, should he return
them to the solicitor who dropped them?
The letters were clearly the property of the
wife; the husband had stolen them, so his
solicitor, even though he had come by them
in good faith, could have no title to them—
and they were essential to the success of the
wife's cause. On the other hand, the soli-
citor who had lost them was the guardian
of them, and they should be looked upon as
confidential documents as between the hus-
band and him. On the ground of profes-
sional etiquette (or, perhaps, as the layman
would have it, of honor among thieves) the
letters were returned to the husband and
nothing said about the matter. But the
point is a nice one, and gave the wife’s soli-
citor a little thinking and the husband’s a
lot of worry.
“Billy T.” : We met the prize philosopher
while we were travelling per boot to test
local reports re the almost incredible
supplies of blackfish in the pools below
Mount Arthur. We were all very sorry for
ourselves, the day having turned intolerably
hot, and the flies having become a weariness.
Three miles this side we diverted from our
track to investigate a column of smoke rising
above the trees, and found the remains of a
house, still smouldering. At a safe distance
from the fire was a pile of household traps
and ware —-tables, chairs, beds and bedding.
On a log in the shade sat a grey woman
blackened by smoke and soot. She sat with
her folded arms on her knees, and having
glanced at us with faded eyes sunk her head
upon her arms. Near her a man, black as
herself, bald and grey-whiskered, was setting
stumps in the ground by a jumble stack of
sawn stuff, refuse from a mill evidently. In
response to our inquiries he pointed to the
charred framework of what had been his
home. “House burned,” said he. “And
what are you doing?” I asked. "Buildin’
another, ’ he replied, and went on with his
work.
J.T.M. ’: The failure of Bottomley’s
libel action will recall to Diggers the extra-
ordinary interest created in the Old Dart
by Horatio’s flamboyant journalism in his
JOHN Bull newspaper. Nearly every week
he -shrieked, “Watch Spain,” “Watch Italy,”
"Hatch Russia,” or something such, and
prophesied immediate sensational develop-
ments. Almost invariably a dead calm
settled upon the place we were asked to
watch. One Billjim, observing this, and
dying for a spell, sent, Bottom ley a note: —
Dear John Bull,—For Gawd’s sake fell the world
to watch the western front for a couple of weeks.
“Centurion”: The other day two Yankees,
►Stinson and Bertrand, broke the world's re-
cord for a non-stop aeroplane flight of 26hr.
20min. They used a Larsen ’plane, an all-
metal affair with some rather unpleasant
features from a pacifist’s viewpoint. It has
a cabin protected by bullet-resisting armor,
carries a crew of three, with a battery
of 30 machine-guns. These weapons are
arranged in two sections of IT each, with
a central control which enables one man to
fire the sections independently, or both to-
gether. like a battleship’s batteries. The
other two guns can be worked independently
by pilot and observer, and are for defence
The ’plane’s speed is over 140 m.p.h.; it
has been designed to fly over enemy ’planes
and blow them out with a concentrated
burst of fire, and then climb again and re-
place the magazines for the batteries, which
takes the fire-controller four minutes for the
lot. As the jigger carries a great weight of
bombs as well, it promises to be eminently
useful m a scrap, and seems to justify some-
wbatour own Defence Department’s attitude
of ‘ Whats the use?” towards aviation, mili-
tary and civil.

,1.0.1.. • Ashfield (Sydney) is about to
celebrate its jubilee as a borough. It might
as well, while it’s at it, celebrate its cen-
tenary. Francis H. Grundy, in his “Pictures
ot the Past,” published in London, 1870,
says that the place was so named because,
about a century ago, a tribe of blacks sur-
prised some picnickers, slaughtered the lot
and burned the bodies—a heap of ashes re-
vealing the. site of the tragedy. As a matter
of fact, 100 years and more ago Ashfield was
the property of Robert Campbell, the
original of the Wharf . family, who was
descended from the Campbells of Ashfield
(Scotland), cadets of the house of Duntroon,
Argyleskire. Both Ashfield and Duntroon
(where Robert Campbell died) are kept in
memory in N. S. Wales.

“Hobnobster” : Re “Ron Ll.’s” rapid family
(B. 26/1/’22). I know a woman who mar-
ried at 25 and had nine children before she
had turned 36. No twins, triplets or four-
plets among them. The last child was born
about .20 years ago, and everybody is doing
well,, including Dad and Mum. I know
this is true, as I’m one of the nine.
* * * *
“Cowra” : “Kelantan’s” record of 10 chil-
dren born in three years (B. 26/l/’22) was
beaten in Cowra(N.S.W.) as regards number
but not time, in 1905, when a proud mdther
rounded off her record with quadruplets after
10 previous children had arrived in this
sequence: twins, triplets, a single, twins and
two singles. In all 14 children at seven
efforts —average, 2. The mother was a twin
and had been married 12 years.
Hugh Blaker from his English studio :
I wonder whether the collectors and artists of
Australia realise what a disadvantage the tax on
pictures is. It has just the opposite effect to what
is intended. All the lower-priced rubbish from the
art sale-rooms in this country is looked upon as
suitable for export. The effect on Australian taste
and knowledge of the arts is deplorable. Most of
the really fine work (of both moderate and high
price) remains here, where there is always a market
for it in normal times. The common stuff can be
bought cheaply enough to bear the tariff and show
a good profit in the colonial market. I have the
greatest admiration for the very vital art which
is produced in Australia, but every indifferent pic-
ture imported has a reactionary effect on the pro-
gress and taste of the country. It inculcates a
love of the commonplace and trivial,, and retards
the natural development of the Australian school.
Let Australia become a real force in the art world
instead of a receptacle for the rubbish of Europe.
Let the students have the same benefit as those of
Europe. No artist can attain to complete self :
expression uninfluenced by what is being* done in
other countries, those of a “new” country less than
any. If the tax were taken off there would imme-
diately be a far higher and finer type of picture
seen in Australia. To-day your artists are working
with their hands fettered by a distortion of the idea
of protecting home industries. The Australian collec-
tor pa.vs something like 50 per cent, higher prices
than his confrere in Europe. This is sufficient to
strangle the development of art rather than foster
it.. P.S. — Please note that there is no question of
my efforts being exported to Australia.
LETTING HIS HONOR IN TOO.
COUNSEL FOR PROSECUTION : “Name ?”
THE FAIRY: “Flossie Syren.”
C. FOR P.: “Address?”
FAIRY ( coquettishly ) : “Oh, Mr. Gogay! You know.”
C. FOR P.: “Yes! Yes! I know; hut his Honor wants to know.”
“Ex-Dig.” : The unsettling effects of active
service caused a good many young fellows
to take the wrong turning when they came
back; but the Sydney police know of
an opposite case. When a before-the-war
“crook” whose daring made him a terror to
the force came back from the Big Row, the
police looked out for further trouble; but
it never came. The man had learnt a trade
after the war in a vocational school in Eng-
land, and now he keeps a steady job going.
He says simply that hb was “converted” in
France—in fact, is prepared to name the
exact spot, as Pozieres. In that hell many
Diggers made vows to Heaven; apparently
the ex-crook is keepjng his.
DIFFERENT EFFECTS.
“Don't you think long hair makes a man

"It depends. My wife found a long hair on

fort to the reinstoushment. I know, because

cussing the probability of Australia being
invaded by the Japs. Came a lull in the
storm and the Choom cut in: “Them argi-
ments soun’s right enough—but ’ow are

* Attached to the old Yarralumla
(N.S.W.) homestead is a legend which a
preacher the other day used curiously in a
sermon to illustrate a want of faith. An
old-time bushranger stuck up a homestead,
and among the loot was a diamond ring said
to be valued at 2000_ guineas. The ’ranger
was shot by the police, but before passing
out gave the ring to an abo. follower. The
nigger, too, was shot, but lie at the last
moment unset the diamond and swallowed
it. A pal who was in the secret buried
the abo. on what is now the lawn in front
of the Yarralumla homestead, and in order
to mark the spot planted a tree. But he
never returned to the spot, and the tree is
now an ancient. And no one has sufficient
faith in the legend to prospect the; remains
of the abo. for the diamond.
* * * *
“J.G.”: A visiting English feminist, in
barracking for her sex in Melbourne the
other day, got one home on a lot of men,
from kings down to one-horse-town mayors,
who, she said, got into ivomen’s petticoats
whenever _ they wanted to show authority.
Which brings to the surface the question,
is there any virtue in the robes worn by
kings or the gowns affected by Judges and
counsel and ’Varsity professors, or the skirts
and things like women’s nightgowns which
pribsts and parsons encase themselves in?
Would a sermon be any more stale without
the nightgown or would a Judge dispense
worse justice if he didn’t have horse-hair on
his baldness and was not dressed like a
woman? I saw the late Justice Hodges dis-
card his wig and robe one red-hot day at
Bendigo, and everything seemed to go on
just the same. If petticoats are necessary
for proper government, then by all means
let’s have ’em ; but if not, why condemn an
apparently decent set of fellows to go on
making themselves look ridiculous?
IN HYDE PARK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Rugged and grey and worn,
Furrowed by time and bowed,
He sits in the park at morn,
Scarce seen by the streaming crowd.
Whither he cares not, nor why,
Borne on a fretful tide,
Fashion and wealth go by,
Folly and beauty and pride.
Dreaming, his dreams recall
Folk of another stamp—
Men who were mates through all,
Mates of the track and camp.
Sharers of bite and sup,
Of bed and. blanket and heart,
Out of the past rise up,
Born of his dreaming start.
Far from the city’s cries,
Noises that ebb and flow,
Dead men from their graves arise.
Nod a greeting and go.
Rugged and grey and worn,
Furrowed by time and bowed, ,
He sits in the park at’morn,
Scarce seen by the passing crowd ;
Wishing the old time back,
Knowing it vain to wish —■
Road and river and track,
Mine and cradle and dish.
Boy with his golden dreams,
Girl with her dancing tread —
To both, as they pass, he seems,
An old man better dead.

“Billy T.”: A slightly 7 different clog sto~y
comes to me from GembrooK district (Vic.), where
a little girl, aged four, went ini?sing early on a
recent Sunday morning, and was still absent in the
evening, 12 hours later. But at about seven, when
hope was almost abandoned, and it was concluded
by many that the youngster had walked into one of
the deep water-holes along the creek, her father
and two uncles came upon her sitting in the grass
On the creek bank above a string oi' dangerous holes.
Not till the father was on the point of catching
his child in his arms was it seen that she was
A START, ANYHOW.
“Glad to sec yer gettin’ a new horse, Skin.”
“Gar-r-rn! Wotcher givin’ as?”
“Well , ain’t that the framework you got up?”
held by a large, rough-haired terrier dog that
crouched in the dry grass by her side. The little
girl’s had been torn in many places by . the
dog’s teeth, and it was plain from the appearance
of the grass and the words of the youngster that the
dog had taken hold of the wanderer, and held her
back from the water-holes. When help arrived he
relinquished his grip, and trotted off home. It is
asserted further that the tyke, who belonged to a
neighbor, called next morning to inquire after
the girl. At any rate, he sprang on to the bed where
she lay, sniffed at her, and being satisfied departed
for his own headquarters.
“De Oriel”: This “mixed farming” has
led to handy results. Advt. ' from the Gippsland
(Vic.) Mercury (19/12/’2l) :
WANTED. —Family to Milk and Shear, 40 cows.
For particulars apply Mr. Blank, Maffra West.
“Moe”: Ever heard of “newspaper oil” as
a cure for toothache? I hadn’t, until recently
an aged and hirsute gentleman from somewhere
near the centre of the continent told me. You
roll half-a-dozen newspapers into a .tight cylindrical
bundle, then tie it at both ends. frext make a
small hole about 2in. from one end and insert a small
spoon, after which you set fire to the roll at the
other end, and hold it vertically as it burns. About
a spoonful of a black, slimy-looking and nauseous-
smelling substance is thus collected in the spoon.
This is “newspaper oil,” and when it is applied on
a fragment of cloth to an aching tooth, it is,
according to my informant, an absolutely infallible
cure. He didn’t say whether the politics of the
newspaper had anything to do with the strength
of the oil, and I’m wondering if that from the S. M.
Herald is more potent than the essence of Truth.
“Orara”: Re birds that will attack man
(B. 17/11/’2l and 29/12/’2l). Add Mrs. Jackass
to the lists. I tried to rob one and it would have
taken more than “Iggery’s” two rounds to keep her
off. Not having a machine-gun I dropped the two
chicks, and ma took them one by one up on a tree.
I don’t know if she put them back in the nest —I
wasn’t game enough to look.
“Werrimee” : The mast curious burial-place
I know is that of squatter Harry Anning, at Mount
Sturgeon (Q.). His father pioneered Reedy Springs
and thereabouts in the early ’sixties, and most of
the boys acquired runs in different parts of the
northern State. Harry was a great lover of horses,
and his dying wish was to be buried in front of
the stockyard gate at Mount Sturgeon, where the
horses would gallop over him when run up in the
mornings. He was planted there, in the open, about
30 years ago, and the hoofs have been pounding over
him ever since.
“Delhi”: Will any Abo. give me a tip for
getting rid of ants? They appear to thrive on
anything from a piece of corned beef to a bag of
sugar, and the taste they leave on bread would make
a rooster spit. Don’t tell me to put the legs of the
safe in water, because it hasn’t got any but hangs
from the roof, and, anyway, it won’t hold half my
stores —but I think the ants will if it goes on much
longer.
“ Jellerab” : The cod isn’t the only fish that
swallows mussels alive. Recently I saw a number of
fresh-water cat-fish caught by the niggers in a
lagoon in the Northern Territory, and most of
them had one or two mussels inside—and the mus-
sels, by the way, were closed and apparently still
alive. The niggers reckon they been catchum plenty
mussel longa barramundi; but I can’t vouch for
that.
“Bouragi”: “Yoyang” (B. 19/l/’22) falls
foul of “McNorth” for saying that no proof of
the use of envenomed weapons has ever been found
in Papua. ‘‘Yoyang quotes the case of surveyor
Stuart Russell's carrier, whose body, after being
buried, was found dug up and stuck full of'spears.
That happened, not on the Owen Stanley Range,
hut on the Papangi divide, between Rogi (on the
Kumusi) and the Yodda goldfield. There was no
question of poisoning- the spears—it was a deliberate
defiance and insult, common among the district
natives, who were in those day’s a cantankerous
lot. I have seen many cases of wounding by the
weapons of these people without any indication of
poison following. As to the beliefs of the authority
quoted by “Yoyang,” I can only say that at
different times he believed in the existence in Papua
of tailed men, ourang-outangs, and a species of rhino-
ceros, as Government reports will show. He also
was the first man to discover the “web-footed people,”
the Arg'hiambo, , who, he said, lived only in the
great swamps and were unable to walk on land.
Governor Chris Robinson later found them to be a
few wretched refugees driven to hide in the swamps
from the Dogeri raiders. Much has been said of
the toxicological knowledge of the Papuan sorcerers,
but, though . more than one scientifically-equipped
person has dived into the matter, none has ever come
up with anything.
“Te Whare”: The proteid ricin, which
“Moe” (B. v 29/12/’2l) mentions as being one of the
three most powerful poisons known, is contained in
the seeds (but not in the refined oil) of ricinus com-
munis—vulgarity, castor-oil plant. A good deal
apparently depends on the mode of preparation of
this family medicine, and where it is very crude
something more than a common or garden stomach-
ache may result from taking it. Castor-oil labelled
“Not for internal use” has a yellowish tinge, and
may still have some ricin left in it. Castor-oil plant
grows rankly in many parts of Australia, but little
has been done with it commercially. Yet in 1878
samples of, locally-produced oil, exhibited in Mel-
bourne, were pronounced “equal to finest Italian.”
THE SEX’S POINT OF VIEW.
SHIPWRECKEF SHE: “Oh, but whatever
should I do if someone should see us?"
SHIPWRECKED HE: “Whatever shall we do
if somebody doesn’t?"
“ Jacaranda”: Re cure for scrub-itch asked
for by “Hecagus” (B. 15/l/’22). In the Solomon
Islands I have rubbed myself well with undiluted
cloudy ammonia. Though it stings a bit it is
death to the parasite, and gives practically instan-
taneous relief.

THE RHYME OF THE THREE GREYBEARDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He’d been for years in Sydney “a-aeting of the goat. ’
His name was Joseph Swallow, “the Great Australian
Pote,”
In spite of all the stories and sketches that he wrote.
And so his friends held meetings (Oh, narrow souls
were theirs!)
To advertise their little selves and Joseph’s own
affairs.
They got up a collection for Joseph unawares.
They looked up his connections and rivals by the
score —
The wife who had divorced him some twenty years
before,
And several politicians he’d made feel very sore.
They sent him down to Goolan, a long train ride
from here,
Because of his grey hairs and “pomes” and painted
blondes —and beer.
(I mean to say the painted blondes would always
give him beer.)
(They loved him for his eyes were dark, and you
must not condemn
The love for opposites that mark the everlasting fem.
Besides, he “made up” little bits of poetry for them.)
They sent him “for his own sake,” but not for that
alone —
A poet’s sins are public: his sorrows are his own.
And poets’ friends have skins like hides, and mostly
hearts of stone.
They said “We’ll send some money and you must
use your pen.
“So long.” they said. “Adoo!” they said. “And
don’t come back again.
Well, stay at least a twelve-month —we might be
dead by then.”
Two greybeards down at Coolan —familiar grins they
had —
They took delivery of the goods, and also of the bad.
(Some bread and meat had come by train —Joe
Swallow was the bad.)
FINANCIAL DEPRESSION.
“ It's been a rotten New Year. No empties
cos dad ain't drinkin’, and rats is very
scarce.”
They’d met him shearing west o’ Bourke in some
forgotten year.
They introduced him to the town and pints of Wagga
beer.
(And Wagga pints are very good—l wish I had some
here.)
It was the Busy Bee Hotel where no one worked
at all.
Except perhaps to' cook the grub and clean the
rooms and “hall.”
The usual half-wit yardman worked at each one’s
beck and call.
’Twas “Drink it down!” and “Fillemup!” and “If
the pub goes dry,
There’s one just two-mile down the road, and more
, in Gundagai”—
Where married folk by accident get poison in the
pie.
The train comes in at eight o’clock—or half-past.
I forget.
And when the dinner table at the Busy Bee was set,
Upon the long verandah stool the beards were
wagging yet.
They talked of where they hadn’t been and what
they hadn’t won ;
They talked of mostly everything that’s known
beneath the sun.
The things they didn’t talk about were big things
they had done.
They talked of what they called to mind, and
couldn’t call to mind ;
They talked of men who saw too far and people who
were “blind.”
Tradition says that Joe’s giey beard wagged not so
far behind.
They got a horse and sulky and a riding horse as
well,
And after three o’clock they left the Busy Bee
Hotel-
In case two missuses should send from homes where
they did dwell.
“"No barber bides in Coolan, no baker bakes the
bread;
And every local industry, save rabbitin’, is dead —
And choppin’ wood. The women do all that, be it
said.
(I’ll add a line and mention that two-up goes ahead.)
The shadows from the sinking sun were long by hill
and scrub ;
The two-up school bad just begun, in spite of beer
and grub ;
But three greybeards were wagging yet down at
the Two-mile pub.
A full, round, placid summer moon was floating in
the sky ;
They took a demijohn of beer, in case they should
go dry ;
And three greybeards went wagging down the road
to Gundagai.
At Gundagai next morning (which poets call ‘th’
morn”)
The greybeards sought a doctor —a friend of the
forlorn —■
Whose name is as an angel’s who sometimes blows a
horn.
And Doctor Gabriel fixed ’em up, but ’twas not in
the bar.
It wasn’t rum or whisky, nor yet was it Three Star.
’Twas mixed up in a chemist’s shop, and swifter
stuff by far.
They went out to the backyard (to make my meaning
plain) ;
The doctor’s stuff wrought mightily, but by no
means in vain.
Then they could eat their breakfasts and drink their
beer again.
They made a bond between the three, as rock against
the wave,
That they’d go to the barber’s shop and each have
a clean shave,
To show the people how they looked when they were
young and brave.
They had the shave and bought three suits (and
startling suits in sooth),
And three white shirts and three red ties (to tell
the awful truth),
To show the people how they looked in their hilarious
youth.
They burnt their old clothes in the yard, and their
old hats as well;
The publican kicked up a row because they made a
smell.
They put on bran’-new “larstin’-sides”—and, oh,
they looked a yell!
Next morning, or the next (or next), from demon-
haunted beds,
And very far from feeling like what sporting men
call “peds,”
The three rode back without their beards, with
“boxers” on their heads!
They tried to get Joe lodgings at the Busy Bee in
vain ;
They did not take him to their homes, they took him
to the train ;
They sent him back to Sydney till grey beards grew
again.
They sent him back to Sydney to keep away a year;
Because of shaven beards and wives they thought
him safer here.
And so he cut his friends and stuck to powdered
blondes and beer.
Until the finish came at last, as ’twill to any
“bloke” ;
But in Joe’s case it chanced to be a paralytic stroke;
The soft heart of a powdered blonde was, as she put
it, “broke.”
She sought Joe in the hospital and took the choicest
food;
She went there very modestly and in a chastened
mood,
And timid and respectful-like—because she was no
good.
She sat the death-watch out alone on the verandah
dim ;
And after all was past and gone she dried her eyes
abrim,
And sought the head-nurse timidly, and asked “May
I see him ?”
And then she went back to her bar, where she’d
not been for weeks,
To practise there her barmaid’s smile and mend and
patch the streaks
The only real tears for Joe had left upon her cheeks.

New Novels

“HERMIT ISLAND” - - - by S. W. POWELL
Papeete was at first curious. Then it grew suspicious. At regular intervals
a little 70-ton schooner, owned and manned by Australians, had put into port
laden to the. hatches with copra and shell which everybody in Papeete knew could not
have been won in the ordinary course of trading. Later, when further full
cargoes arrive immediately after the mysterious disappearance of a couple of well-
known trading steamers, Papeete concludes that another Bully Hayes is on the
high seas.
Around these strange happenings Mr. Powell, whose “Maker of Pearls” has
been one of the most popular of recent novels, tells an excellent story, full of
adventure and humor.
“FEATHERS OF HEAVEN,”
b v jack McLaren.
A great story of adventure in New Guinea. The thrilling experiences of an
Australian prospector, a trader and his daughter in the country of the head-
hunters, and how they became entangled in a daring scheme to defeat the Govern-
ment’s efforts to prevent the traffic in birds-of-paradise.

Hokey”: I can supplement “Bill R.’s”
instance (B. 5/l/’22) of the enormous strength of
the working bullock. At Axedale (Vic.) Doak’s
threshing machine had cleaned up for a local wire-
whisker and was preparing for the next pitch.
Larry Ford yoked his two polers (a pair of elderly
stags) to the 8-liorse portable engine, the wheels
of which were sunk bin. into the ground for firm-
ness, and proceeded to back down the other six,
when, without any fuss, the two polers, with a
mighty heave, lifted the four tons out of the soil
and drew up to their workmates in front. The
amazement of the onlookers (of whom I was one)
was divided between the strength of the mild-eyed
bovines and the toughness of the gear.
“Jim Carew”: The best natural white-ant
exterminator is the very small black ant. Lead
the black by a thin trail of sugar to the whites’
camp, and he will do the rest. When he discovers
the white-ants’ nest he will prospect round for a
couple of days, spying out the position, but for
weeks after that there will be a long stream of
blacks carrying home the bodies of the white ants
that they have killed; and they won’t give up so
long as a single white ant remains in the nest.
* * * *
“Veronal”: I have used various lotions
to scare house flies away from a horse’s eyes in
summer, but nothing is more effective than three
parts sweet oil and one part pennyroyal oil. I
tried carbolic oil, but it brought the hair off around
the eyes, and the prad looked like a spectacled
cobra. I also tried citronella—-which both flies and
mosquitoes shun —but it invariably brought honey-
bees buzzing around the animal, and made things
uncomfortable.
* * •» *
“Iverpatagie”: Isn’t this unusual? I came
across a ma kangaroo the other day on the Lower
Darling with a big joey head-first in her pouch.
His tail was tickling mum’s belly. Joey is usually
pictured with his head protruding from the pouch.

“The Moralist” : Three weeks ago a dog
belonging to a resident of Narama, near Gosford
(N.S.W.), while eating some meat swallowed a
short steel skewer. For a week he seemed to suffer
no inconvenience; ■ then he Showed signs - of being
in great pain, and a lump was found on his back
from the centre of which protruded the point of the

“Y.Z.”; I was going into town with
Cumber one morning during the week, and conversa-
tion flagged while he struggled with a reluctant
cigar, so- that I was able to give some attention to
the mule-faced man opposite. The mule-faced man,
who might have had a head cut from a turnip, so
animated was he, presently leaned forward, and
pressed his forefinger into Cumber’s leg. “What I
was going to say,” said he, dully, “was that you
would have saved a mile by goin’ through Neighbor’s
back paddock and over the hill. 1 don’t see how
you can hold it’s nearest up along the lake, and
round that way.” Cumber looked at the man in
amazement for a moment, and then came recognition.
“Why, it’s Wilson,” said he, “Acourse it’s Wilson,”
was the reply, “and you’re wrong. I’ll bet you a
quid on it. It’s a mile shorter through Neighbor’s

Cumber said to me: “Funny, ain’t it, how some
blokes will stick to a point ? That was the argu-
ment I was having with Wilson when we parted on
the railway station at Sale, I haven’t seen him for
five years.”
“Pickles, J.P.”: I don’t know anything
about the fennel recommended by “Jim Carew” (B.
5/1/ 22) as an anti-blowfly decoration, but want
“Tarago’’ (B. 15/12/’2l) to listen very hard to this.
About 40ft. from my back door stands one of his
elderberry fly-scarers, and any old morning after a

spray ornaments the hanging lamp as I scribble
this, and five blowflies and numerous other flies are
ornamenting it. Mrs. Pickles places more reliance
on good Australian insecticide, as with it and the
aid of a dlist-pan and small broom she feeds the
kitchen fire with hundreds of “blows” weekly.
* * * *
“Wart”: The worst enemy of the blowfly
is the spine-billed honey eater—painter, as he is
called in the Speck. You would think his long,
curved bill was an awkward instrument for catching
flies with, but when the young are in the nest the
old birds feed them on very little else for a couple
of months. Even when there are plenty of honey-
laden flowers about the old birds do a little fly-
catching for themselves. All honey eaters seem to.
* * » .
“Marri”: “Moe’s” remarks (B. 5/l/’22)
about glycogen are open to ques-
tion. It is, indeed, quite estab-
lished that the glycogen of the
liver is constantly in use. The
characteristic substance of meat,
the proteins, aye almost wholly
converted by the liver into this
carbohydrate glycogen. The nitro-
gen of the proteins appears in
another product of the change,
uric acid. This enters the blood
and is normally removed by the
kidneys. When the sugar and
starch part of a meal has been
used up in producing bodily heat
and in doing work in the muscles,
the liver starts to change its
stored glycogen into sugar, which
enters the blood and is used up
as before. And this goes on until
the sugar and starch of the next
meal are available. Actually, all
but a small percentage of the
protein is made available to the
body per medium of the glycogen,
which “Moe” says “plays an un-
important part.” As for the yarn
about the “odor of substances, into
which the broken down glycogen
becomes transformed,” I can
safely challenge “Moe” to produce
an atom of evidence for his state-
ment. %
G.H.” : Will some Abo. enlighten me as to
how it is a dog can follow its owner’s tracks hours
after he has'passed, when he has only boot-leather for
a scent ? Also, how is it that a hound when hunting
can tell almost immediately which way the game has
gone, and so avoid running a back scent?
“Rae-akiaki”: At Maxwelltown (M.L.)
the other day W. Higgins took only Bhr. 24min. to
shear 372 sheep. He used only one machine, and
changed his own cutters. The sheep were large
ewes, not picked, and no lambs included.
“M.C.”: Would “Topi” (B. 12/l/’22)
divulge the particular mystic rite, or incantation that
is performed over the plate of kerosene to entice
the elusive flea to commit suicide in it? For six
nights now I’ve tried it, but nary a corpse have
I seen. And the live fleas are as numerous and as
lively as ever.

“D.F.”: There are nearly 40 species of
birds which migrate to
Australia from the
Northern Hemisphere.
Most of them spend
the northern summer
and breed in eastern
Asia, in China, Japan,
Manchuria, Mongolia
and Siberia. But at
least two, Bartram’s
sand-piper and the
American grey-rumped
sand-piper, breed in
Alaska and on the
Aleutian Islands.
These, however, do not
come to Australia in
anything like the
numbers of the Asiatic
migrants, such as the
turnstone, the grey and
lesser golden plover,
the dottrels, sand-
piper, godwits and
others. Some, like the
turnstone, the knot, the
barred-rumped gotwit
and the sharp-tailed
stint, send a- secondary
stream of birds to
Maoriland. The general
rule is that the birds
that go farthest south
in our summer go far-
thest north to breed,
and some of the Species
that visit the Speck
and Maoriland breed on
the Siberian tundra and
in the Arctic circle.
They have even been
found breeding north
“Bn Zed”: I can back up “Wanderer” (B.
15/12/’2l) re fresh-water eels tackling dogs. While
duck-shooting here (Wairoa, M.L.) last season, I sent
my little water-spaniel into a lake to bring in a
couple of ducks. He was pulled under a couple of
times, hut managed to scramble ashore. The eels in
this particular lake made a meal of several ducks I
Shot. And they have been known to come out of a
creek and rob a chicken-coop.
“The Wanderer” : A. McNeil, of Wherrol
Flat, near Wingham (N.5.W.,, heard a screech in a
high, straight sapling the other day ; and glancing up
saw a hare resting in a fork at the top. It was also
partly resting in the mouth of a big goanna that
was dining on its stomach before the animal was
dead; consequently the screeching was pardonable.
McNeil at first thought the hare must have climbed
the tree, but as he had never seen one that could
climb worth a cent he now reckons it went up in
the mouth of the old-man go.-—and they grow some
whoppers on the Dingo Creek, near Wingham.

“5.N.0.”: Having successfully used leeches
to reduce a swelling caused by a tick, I’m wondering
if they are of any value in case of snake-bite. It’s
the sort of job that should appeal to ’em.
* * * *
“V. 1.8.”: Manv wise Abos. have told the
world what to do with a fiery mustang once
it has been caught, but can anyone save me
from going stoney on hobbles, sidelines, etc.,
by advising me how to deal with a prad
that objects to being caught? The salt-on-the-tail
cure is barred, as this chap holds his too high
in a wholesome contempt for my efforts to yard or
catch him under an hour. I’d sell the brute, only
his performances are better known than Carbine’s.

“The Moralist”: Joe Timbs,- of Glen Innes
(N.SiW.), set out three months ago from that town
with 600 head of cattle from Newbold station for
delivery to McKinnon Bros., Melbourne. He handed
over every beast, and the job was done for £1 10s.
per head less than it would have cost to rail them.
“Aebine”: Will “Ziak” (B. 29/12/’2l) be
a sport and give full particulars of his blowfly
mixture, i.e., how much of each ingredient men-
tioned. likewise the method of applying, and so
earn the undying gratitude of countless cockies?
* * * *
“Mibu” : If those Abos. who can’t find a
market for their sheep-skins would turn them into
mosquito-proof boots (slipper soles) and put them
on the market at some price near 10s. they would
sell thousands in N. Queensland, Papua and the
islands. I have yet to find a store in Australia
that stocks them; most of us have to send to
Blighty or Singapore for them.
* * * *
“X-Ray”: While I was living near Charle-
ville (Q.) I heard the same statement as “Jim
Carew’’ (B. 12/l/’22) about the beefwood bark
being dead on the western side of the tree. I
decided to test it, and found that 80 p.c. of the
trees had this peculiarity.
E.M.YV. : A farmer in this Gippsland
district (Vic.) hit upon an ingenious and successful
way of dealing with the caterpillar pes t. A furrow
about 18in. wide, was ploughed all round the crop and
filled in with tar. The caterpillars, in attempting
to cross this, were caught by the thousand. When
the invasion ceased the earth was simply turned
back over the casualties and the crop remained un-
touched.
* * * *
“De Valera”: “Jim Carew” says (B.
12/1 /’2 2) that the platypus has no duct in his
spur, and he quotes Professor Semon, of Jena, as
saying that under the microscope he could discover
none. Well, there is one. I’ve handled hundreds
of the spurs, and there is a duct right through
to the point, and it can be seen with the naked
eye. There is a nerve running out to the point, like
the nerve in a man’s tooth, and I have pulled this
out many times in cleaning the spurs preparatory
to having them mounted as ornaments for watch-
chains.
“Jacky Roo” : “Jim Carew’s” N.T. friend
(B. 12/l/’22) is right about the beefwood tree’s bark
being a.w.l. on the western side and the wood dead.
I can’t vouch for the northern State, but I know in
western N. S. Wales we always reckoned it a good
guide.

“Kirk”: Can any Abo. identify a 15in.
wriggler caught up in N.Q. recently—all ' lack bar
a narrow white line completely encircling the top
of the head ?
* * * *
“N.C.S.”: My mare has broken out in
strange sores that have me puzzled. Tie trouble
started with lumps on her head and neck and belly,
those on the belly being the size of a small plate.
Then the hair fell off, and the lumps split, each
exposing an ugly sore. The prad still eats and
trots as before. Can any Abo. vet. relieve me of toy
puzzlement and the mare of the sores?
“Rolls”: This happened in Myhree (Vic.).
We had 37 cows milking night and morning, and
suddenly, for no apparent reason, the afternoon
supply dropped in a remarkable way. At the end
of a week we sent for a herd specialist, and he said
the milk was taken away from the cows sometime
between morning and evening. We cast suspicious
eyes on our near neighbor, and decided to keep
watch. At about 2 p.m. one hot day we caught sight
of nine cows standing quite still in the hot sun —a
curious fact that made us investigate. Getting closer
we found 36 snakes engaged in sucking Strawberry
and her mates dry. We got 35 of them with sticks.
“Morob”: Some years ago, near Cook-
town (Q.), a friend and I saw a big black snake
carrying a small, brightly-polished tobacco tin iri
its mouth. We watched to see where it was going,
then finished it off, its destination being a large
cavity between three rocks. Here it had made a
sort of nest and around the sides were 15 or 20
small objects, such as empty tins, tobacco tags
and pieces of glass, all of which were more or less
shiny. The nearest human habitation was a tin-
miner’s camp about half-a-mile away, and it was
from there that the reptile must have obtained the
things that took its fancy. This is the only instance
I know of such articles having any attraction for
a snake; but I have seen other instances where
things which reflect the sun’s rays strongly have
undoubtedly exercised some sort of hypnotic power
over birds and lower animals.
THERE TIRESOME RESTRICTIONS.
WEEK-END BEACH INSPECTOR: “Now, then,
young man, you can’t sunbake ’ere.”
“Thuringa”: When I was droving in the
middle ’nineties three men I had assisting me could
neither read nor write, but one of them, Billy, knew
the letters of the alphabet. At that time a popular
brand of jam had as a trade-mark a big emu. At
dinner one day Billy was holding a tin containing
black currant jam and was airing his knowledge by
reciting the letters —“B-l-a-c-k”—when the wag
of the camp said, “That beats you, Billy ; you don’t
know what that spells.” “You’re a liar, I do,” says
William. “It’s ‘emu.’ ”

Behind every crop there has been good seed
and proper preparation of the soil, etc.
Good results don’t just happen. It’s the
same with motor tyres—you can only, get
the wear and service that the manufacturer
puts into them; and that is why “Railroad”
m
an
have won such a great reputation for mileage and
dependable service with carists and motor cyclists.
The finest materials the world produces go into
every “Dunlop,” plus the knowledge gained in building
tyres for Australasian conditions-since cars were first
used on our roads. The result is that the “ Dunlop” of
to-day stands right out by itself for quality, value and
service. You see them everywhere. It is obvious that
they must be better, otherwise why do more than
half the motorists in this country always use them ?
If you are in doubt as to how “Railroads” stand
up to hard work, ask those who use them. Let their
experience guide you to real tyre satisfaction.
All garages can supply.

9 tools scrapped
and £,5 saved.
THE 9 tools shown on the left used to
form part of any shearing expert’s
kit—until the JJsfeß “S” Handpiece
came along. With its Patent Self-levelling
Crown Plate and other features the JlsTeß
did away with the need for these tools and
saved not only £5 in cash but the time
previously spent in using the tools.
In fact, MsTeß Shears can be relied on
to be “on the job’’ the whole of the shearing.
They don’t waste your time in the expert’s
hands. If you are considering new handpieces
or machines for this season it will pay you to
get in touch with the nearest

this year of grace 1922 than in the year
1822 can you maintain with success (or
with social safety) the proposition that
you can divide your love without taking
some of it away from somebody. Still less
can you claim (openly) to regard one
woman as the sun of your life, and another
as the moon, and say that from both these
“planets” you can obtain guidance and draw
inspiration. The Eastern world would admit
the theory, but the Western world (or the
greater part of it) will deny it indignantly,
and kick the propounder, even while secretly
practising what it openly disavows. In
these respects we have not moved an inch
since Shelley wrote. The minority know
that in his Epipsychidion he spoke at least
a partial truth; but as- the majority are just
as sure he uttered a damnable heresy, you
are left exactly as you were.
ALFRED BUCHANAN.

There is a good deal to.interest philologists
in the manner in which the initial aspirate
in Australia is becoming softer with each
succeeding generation—a sure proof that
climatic influences are beginning to make
themselves felt ,on the race. Although the
aitcli sound has by no means become extinct,
as it has in French, Italian and Spanish, it
is nevertheless breathed so softly, even by
the educated, that at times it is difficult to
distinguish it at all, and the probabilities
are that somewhere within the century it will
have disappeared altogether, as it has from
the Latin languages.
It is a biological axiom that the organism
responds to its surroundings and in time
acquires its specific characteristics from them,
this applying to peoples just as much as to
some lowly form of life like amoeba. In
countries where the average temperature is
high, effort is avoided, and generally' the first
manifestation of this is in speech. Now,
if there is one sound in the language
of man which more than another calls
for effort it is that which is repre-
sented. by _ the letter h; and so, in
countries like those where the Latin-
descended tongues are spoken, it has been
gradually eliminated, although, of course, the
symbol still remains in the written language
because no more effort is required to write
h than any other letter. Especially is this
so in the brand of Spanish spoken in South
America. The conquistadores, when they'
first arrived from Spain, brought with them
a sound which had some approach to the as-
pirate, such as appeared in the. pronunciation
of a word like “Jose,” which they called
“Hosay.” But as generation after generation
grt>w up under the influences of the mellow
climate of the country, they got rid of this
phonetic, so that to-day the word is pro-
nounced “Osay.” It is not to be wondered
at. that the same change should be occurring
in this country. Already from most lips
“where” or “when” are sounded as though
they did not contain an h at all.
The matter opens up some interesting ques-
tions as to the direction in which the evolu-
tion of a national speech will take place.
That one will be evolved cannot be doubted,
for it is unthinkable, from a biological stand-
point, that a ..response to environment will
not occur. Yet it is a subject upon which
it is unsafe to speculate, for no one can say
what the future will hold, and there is no
sphere in which prophecies are more apt to
turn out failures. But it is probable that
the first change will be in the dropping of
sounds for which any conscious effort is re-
quired and the softening of the harsher ones.
GREGOR.
De Vere Identified
“M.M.P.” on the search for Shakspeare:
I have to thank Mr. David McKee Wright for his
remarks (R.P. 5/l/’22) in reply to my criticism of
Looney’s book. It seems I overlooked the “big
things,” and Mr. Wright has been good enough to
gather these together for me. I am quite ready to
meet Mr. Wright on the ground he has chosen.
The “Willy” Proof. —I will assume, for the
present purpose, that Spenser referred to De Vere
in “The Shephearde’s Calendar” and “The Teares
of the Muses,” although the “proof arrived at step
by step” is, to my mind, a fantastic series of pre-
posterous assumptions. But, if “Willy” be De
Vere, what then? The reference would be to the
lost plays of De Vere, not to the “S” plays. Looney
says the language could apply only to such an artist
as Shakspeare. Therefore the lost plays were
written by the same- hand. But who can set
bounds to the language of eulogy (of an Earl!),
and say that it could apply only to one of the bril-
liant band of Elizabethans? Spenser speaks of “sea-
soned wit and goodly pleasance,” and of “the man
whom Nature selfe had made to mock herself and
truth to imitate with kindly counter under mimic
shade.’’ There seems to me nothing very extrava-
gant in this praise, and I also suggest that the gener-
ally-accepted view that the words refer to an actor
and not to a dramatist is borne out by 'a considera-
tion of the words themselves.
The Lyly and Munday Proof.— Looney is said to
have proved De Vere’s association with these two
authors. The association was well known before Looney
was born. Shakspeare, it is said, owed most to
these two dramatists, and “parallel passages” are
cited in proof of this. The statement of indebted-
ness is exaggerated, and the parallel passages only-
serve to prove Looney’s want of literary discernment.
I wish I had the space to quote them. But what
does the proof amount to? De Vere patronised
Lyly and Munday: Lyly and Munday inspired Shaks-
peare: therefore, De Vere wrote the “S” plays.
There seems to be a missing link in the argument,
even allowing that all the alleged facts were proved.
As to Munday, it should be remembered that the
recent discovery of the manuscript copy of his play
of “Sir Thomas Moore” suggests that the interpola-
tion which was thought to be in the style of Shaks-
peare is actually in the handwriting of the Stratford
man. If this be so, and no less an authority than
Sir E. Maunde Thompson thinks it probable, the
whole Stratford controversy is ended.
De Vere’s and Shakspeare’s retirements. —There
is no proof that De Vere “retired to engage in
some absorbing occupation” at any time. All that
is known is that after 1592 there are only occasional
references to his public activities. He was, however,
during the period when the “S” plays were written,
Lord Great Chamberlain, sat on various commissions
and took part in various ceremonies. Does the fact
that, after 1592, there are only sporadic references
to him prove, or even suggest, that during that
time he was enjoying a “second time on earth”
as a dramatist? Looney’s allegation that William
Shakspeare left London for Stratford in 1596 is per-
haps the most arbitrary of his many arbitrary sug-
gestions. Shakspeare’s close connection with the
London stage up to 1604 at least is shown by docu-
mentary evidence, and accepted by all the writers
on the subject, anti-Stratfordians as well as Strat-
fordians. As for money-lending, this libellous allega-
tion rests on the fact that Shakspeare brought
three lawsuits to recover debts, one in London in
1600 and two in Stratford in 1604 and 1608-09.
A money-lender carrying on business in Stratford
from 1596 to 1616 would, I fancy, have troubled
the local courts more than that. But is a man to
be dubbed money-lender because he sues for the
recovery of three debts? My answer to this part
of Looney’s case is that he doe 3 not prove either
branch of it, but if he had proved the facts I
do not see how they suggest that the Earl employed
the actor as a mask. Why should he get him out
of London for that purpose? Would his absence
have raised doubts as to his authorship amongst
contemporaries? If it would, the mask was badly
chosen, and in danger of discovery. If not, why
should it raise doubts in our minds?
The Meres List. —Mr. Wright suggests that because
Meres refers to Oxford as “the best in comedy,” but
refers to Shakspeare’s plays by name, some inference
is to be drawn as to the identity of thertwo authors.
But Meres does not refer to Oxford as “the best.”
He mentions him as one of 17 English authors who
are the best in comedy. He puts Oxford first, because
of his rank as an Earl, not as a dramatist. Read
the passage and you will notice that the four “gentle-
men” authors; are mentioned first, with their titles
or additions, and then follow the professionals who,
by the way, include Shakspeare. Meres gives Shaks-
peare a paragraph to himself, in which his plays
are named, and he is acclaimed as pre-eminent in
comedy and tragedy. Shakspeare also figures in the
lists' of the best in comedy and tragedy, but Oxford
is not mentioned in the latter list. Obviously
Oxford is included by Meres by reason of the lost
plays, just as 10 years earlier Puttenham had men-
tioned him as author of the “Chappell” comedies.
I have now taken each “big .thing” separately and
endeavored to reply to it. Limits of space have
compelled me to state my dissent at times with
apparent dogmatism. That could not be avoided.
But I trust I have made clear the grounds of my
non-acceptance of each argument. And if each argu-
ment be worthless, then all together are equally
worthless. I am aware that Looney has advanced
other points not yet mentioned by either Mr. Wright
or myself; but I hope that in confining myself to
those mentioned by Mr. Wright I am not again side-
stepping.
The Inky Way
“Ellae”: Why don’t we all go mad over one book
any more? Is it that there are so many different
points of interest nowadays that we can’t focus on
one, oy have, wp. lost the power of universal enthusi-
asm? This morning I carrie across “Trilby” in
clearing out an old bookshelf, and flew backwards
25 years to the time when all classes talked Trilby,
dreamed Trilby, named helpless girl-babies ‘ Trilby
(and so stamped their age on them as plainly as on
any Victorian Diamond Jubilee or Redvers Buffer
Pretoria), and the most fm-de-siecle (pet news-
paper phrase of the time) extremists even gave
Trilby teas, where the guests sat in short dresses,
barefooted. (This took more daring in those trail-
ing-skirted, high-collared days than the surfing,
verandah-sleeping, pneumonia-bloused-and-petticoatless
flapper of to-day can begin to imagine.) There
were books before “Trilb'y” that created the same
uproar, but have there been any since? We can
still get mildly enthusiastic over some particular
author (just now it seems to be the whip-crazed
Ethel Dell, who rarely gets through six chapters
without making somebody flog. somebody else), but
the day of the One Big Book seems to be done. Why?
“Newborn”: Turning over a dusty pile of booklets
in a second-hand shop I came across a brown-paper
edition of J. Le Gay .Brereton’s “Sweetheart Mine:
Lyrics of Love and Friendship” (1897), with this
in Brereton’s handwriting:—
“The spell of Shakspeare fills the heart
AVith earthly music loud and low:
But Marlowe drives the clouds apart
And through their thundering rifts we go.”
The lines on Marlowe are worth preserving as the
quarter-century-old expression of the most literary
Professor of to-day’s Sydney University.
Mick Shanahan, who edits Sydney’s , new morn-
ing paper, the Mail, went to that journal from the
Telegraph. He served his novitiate in Westralia,
where, when quite a youngster, he was sub-editor
of Kalgoorlie Sun.
“Pollio”: The just-published “Life of Lord Salis-
bury” will at any rate put an end to a whole saga
of gold-rush stories about the quondam Robert
Cecil as a Ballarat (or Bendigo, or any other old
diggings) miner. The truth is that the young
Cecil, who had been a much-bullied sickly school-
boy and was forced to leave Oxford after two years,
couldn’t have lifted a pick to save his life. He
was on a round-the-world voyage with that object
in view (I mean saving his life) when he landed
at Adelaide in January, 1852. He spent eight months
in Australia and Tasmania (whose climate he
thought the best in the world), and out of that
one month only was spent on a goldfield, during
which he was the guest of Armstrong, the police
commissioner at Mount Alexander. His account
of Armstrong’s rule over his miners reads like
Sunday-school fiction, but must have been true-
even the story of how Armstrong found two men on
their way to wash a bag of washdirt one Sunday,
held them up,; threw the dirt all over the road, and
made them apologize profusely for breaking the
Sabbath. Sunday labor was forbidden at Mount
Alexander, ajid the sale of alcoholic liquor absolutely
prohibited. “There was less crime,” wrote Cecil
to his father, “than in a large English town, and
more order and civility than I have myself wit-
nessed in my own native village of Hatfield.” But
this was on the diggings, it must be remembered,
and fits in with Hotham’s idyllic picture of the
Ballarat digger and his family going to church
on Sundays. Melbourne was another story—fuff
of drunken miners trying to make the most noise
for their money, and sadly lacking in devotion
to the Church of England.
“D.F.”: The Mitchell Library has obtained from
a Melbourne Digger, G. Colville, a set of one of the
most out-of-the-way front-line papers, Oh Pip, the
journal of the Observation Post men, which
struggled out at irregular intervals. It includes
some remarkably good sketches, hot from life at
the front. Some of the jokes are grim enough, such
as a yawning grave labelled “A vacancy for a good
man.” One artist puts in a pencil drawing of
a fellow-Digger and writes below: “A good straight
clean-living Australian and the whitest man I ever
knew. I saw him killed yesterday.”
“0.K.”: An old ransacker of lumber rooms, John
Doran, who was editor of Notes and Queries at the
time of his death, published in 1856 a two-volume
book dedicated “to the Right Hon. Viscount Las-
celles, and to the Hon. Egremont William Las-
celles.” This book, dealing with the institution
of Kings and the dethronement of so many of them,
was entitled "“Monarchs Retired from Business.”
Doran seems to have been the sort of book-compiler
who toadies to titles, but one of his conclusions,
at the end of volume 2, would hardly have been
dedicated to a Lascelles who was going to marry
into a reigning family:—
“In mere externals, perhaps, people and princes
of modern times may be more refined, but they are
not inwardly more honest and virtuous than the
rudest of monarchs and roughest of subjects in the
most remote periods: they are only more hypo-
critical.”
The Adam Lindsay Gordon Memorial Committee
will publish shortly in Melbourne a limited edition
de luxe (1000 copies) of the complete works of the
poet. The volume is to be illustrated in color and
line, and will include a biographical sketch by Edward
A. Vidler and verse on Gordon by various Aus-
tralian poets.
“E.W.D.”: In certain remarks, first published in
connection with a set of engravings of Australian
scenery, afterwards forming part of the preface to
the 1876 edition of Gordon’s “Sea Spray and Smoke
Drift,” Marcus Clarke wrote inter alia: “In Aus-
tralia alone is to be found the Grotesque, the Weird,
the strange scribblings of Nature learning how to
write. Some see no beauty in our trees without
shade, our flowers without perfume, our birds who
cannot fly, and our beasts who have not yet learned
to walk on all fours. But the dweller in the wilder-
ness acknowledges the subtle charm of this fantastic
land of monstrosities. He becomes familiar with
the beauty of loneliness.” There is more to that
effect, but neither such lines, nor those of Gordon
quoted by “Newborn,” substantiate the so-called
criminal statement that “the Australian bush has
neither bird-song nor flower-scent.” Surely Gordon
and Clarke were merely emphasing some special
feature of Australian fauna and flora.
“Rypo”: Edward Dyson’s article on Lindsay Gor-
don in Ballarat (R.P. 12/l/’22) reminds us that
Gordon’s verse-making was reckoned of little im-
portance compared with his horsemanship while lie
lived. A few years ago a journalist visited our vil-
lage (Coleraine, Vic.). He thought. he would get
some first-hand stories of the poet, this being the
scene in which “The Fields of Coleraine” was laid.
The journalist was put on to a very old resident and
a likely informant. Did he recollect the poet Gor-
don? “No.” “Not Adam Lindsay Gordon, who was
in the district in the ’sixties ?” “NO. The only Gordon I
recollect was Long Gordon, the jockey.” Collapse-of
journalist! He revived himself somewhat, and went
in search of the original of Buyelot’s “Waterpool at
Coleraine.” He pointed to a pool surrounded by red-
gums. “Is that Buvelot’s Waterpool?” he asked a
passer-by. “No, it belongs to Bill Jones,” was the
disdainful reply. The journalist packed up his
fountain-pen and went home. P.S. —Coleraine is a
township that some years ago banished The Bulle-
tin from the Mechanics’ Institute reading-room.
A note from Rita Island (N. Q.) :
In B. 29/12/’2l there is a reference to J. W. Frings,
a literary neighbor of “Beachcomber” Banfield,
who is said to have written a book called “The
Occupants.” Frings is opposed to pants of all
sorts, and whenever occasion permits he dispenses
with them altogether. I found him recently,
when making an unexpected call upon him in his
bush home, of which at the moment he was sole
occupier, writing at his table with his pince-nez
on, and nothing else. No doubt the reference is
to “The Occult Arts,” a scientific enquiry into
the alleged supernormal powers of man. This
book was reprinted in a second edition within 12
months of original English publication, and an edition
has been published in the U.S.A. Frings’s latest
scientific study, “Psychic Evolution,” was published
in England rather more than two years ago. Inci-
dentally, the Wide World Magazine is giving serially
an illustrated narrative entitled “My Island of
Dreams” descriptive of the coral speck recently
settled by Mr. Frings. He is a giant for mwork.
In addition to building himself a house here he
has been engaging for some months past in a study
of the sugar industry in the Ayr district, the
results of which he has already embodied in a long
technical article for the World’s Work, and is now
writing a novel, a romance of the industry, local color
for which he has been absorbing.
Fred Johns’s “A Journalist’s Jottings” is to be
brought out in April or May by the Hassell Press,
of Adelaide. Net proceeds are to go to the Matthew
Flinders Statue Fund, of which Johns is hon. sec.
“T.R.H.”: With the fear of competition in the
near future the Melbourne Herald is now dressing
its window differently. Its “inside pages” are an
exact imitation of the London Daily Mail make-up.
Also d la Carmelite House, everybody is now an
editor. There is the managing editor, the literary
editor, the magazine page editor and the gardening
editor. A glance at the building shows that the
window-cleaning editor neglects his duties.
“Machete”: Lance Fallow, mentioned by “Muzzie”
(B. 19/l/’22) as succeeding Herbert Shaw in the
editorship of the Geelong (Vic.) Advertiser, is an
Afrikander, and about the best writer of serious
verse the Union has produced. Before going to
Queensland, where he has lived of late years, he
published a couple of volumes which deserve
much wider fame than they seem to- haVe achieved.
A Satchel of Books
Flappers and Philosophers, by F. Scott Fitzgerald
. (Scfihher’s). A collection of eight short stories, all
good, and the first, “The Offshore . Pirate,” a gein.
The weakest point about the book is its title.
Nonsense Novell, by Stephen Leacock (John Lane).
An illustrated edition ; each year bias an appropriately
insane picture in color, and there are many others
in silhouette. This is the 12th reprint since the
“Novels” first appeared in 1911.
Alice Adams, by Booth Tarkington (Hodder and
Stoughton) Readable enough, but not by any means
Tarkington’s best \vprk. Merely a thin and hurried
attempt to portray a poor girl’s unsuccessful struggle
to climb among the aristocrats, and without one
really convincing character. .
Mexico on the Verge, by by. E. .L Dillon (Hutch-
inson). A curiously dull book about one of the most
interesting countries in the world. It is dull partly
because innumerable allusions, references and anec-
dotes are dragged in, more, one suspects, to demon-
strate the author’s wide culture or profound influence
in foreign affairs, than for their value to the
narrative; partly because the case for General
Obregon is overstated. It is overstated for an evident
reason. The U.S.A. public, to whom this book is
chiefly addressed, has a passionate desire to play
fair, not only in Cuba and the Philippines, but
wherever that, vague instrument the Monroe Doc-
trine runs, But the U.S.A. politician, who is often
the creature of Wall-street, and that part of the
press which is controlled by both, suffer from no
such weakness. Mexico, with its colossal store of
natural wealth side by side with a poverty-stricken
population, cannot avoid being the prOy of “big
business,” and it is the pqlicy-of the Yankee finan-
ciers to satisfy their lesp ..affluent fellow-citizens that
no Mexican .Government which objects to them is
honest. “The public is told, for instance,” Dr.
Dillon says,, “that the . Mexican Constitution contains
a clause confiscating- the property of Americans
who have invested their capital, devoted their
brains and employed their time in exploiting the
oil-fields.” And he explains: “Article 27 is not
confiscatory, because it does not stand alone. If
it stood alone retractive force might perhaps
be read into it by jurisconsults, and retractive
force would undoubtedly render it what is termed
confiscatory; ' But nothing less than that. For the
clause only nationalises the products of the subsoil,
and nobody has ever denied to the Mexican Republic
the right to do this. And foreigners’ .property is
expressly exempted by Article 14, which declares
.that nationalisation shall not work backwards, but
’only forwards.” Scores of similar misunderstand-
ings and misrepresentations are similarly cleared
up. It is splendid propaganda from the Obregon
standpoint, but it, makes dreary reading.

“L.P.”: The public will read with no sur-
prise that the Queensland Government has
granted a concession of some 73 miles of
South Queensland coast to the Brisbane
Sponge Co. Sponging has become one of
the State’s greatest industries.

“Rae-akiaki”: In the days of the M.L.
gold-digger big prices used to be paid for
sawn timber. At Mutton Town, which
sprang up when the Dunstan rush took
place, ordinary hand-cradles cost £lO, and
it was a common thing to give £2 or £3 for
empty brandy- or gin-caSes.

“Child of Israel” : Re “Sixenate’s” remarks
as to kosher meat on the Commonwealth
liners (B. 19/l/’22). Only about two
Jews in every hundred carry out this
portion of the Mosaic Law. There is no
need for its observance to-day, as inspectors
examine meat in every State, and condemn
that which is not fit for human consumption.
“Tren”: The authorities are to blaine for
“gummy” shark masquerading as Murray
cod in Melbourne. The Superintendent of
Markets admits that last year 360,0001 b.
were openly sold in the Fish Market without
the name appearing in the daily market
quotations. So the public, which could have
no suspicion that a fish it regards as an
abomination was being foisted on consumers,
ate on an average 10001 b. of it a day. And
the city authorities never moved an eyelash.
“Hortus”: The Queensland fruit-fly bids
fair if its ravages are not stopped to be
one of the country’s worst curses. Hitherto
Stanthorpe fruit—peaches and apples—have
been immune, but this year the grub has
appeared in both. Just so long as abandoned
orchards are left as fly-breeding grounds,
and Shire Councils go on planting Moreton
Bay figs in hundreds by the roadside, there
will be no hope of checking this pest. Open
any Moreton Bay fig in the ripe stage and
flies will swarm out in dozens. Yet the
obvious moral has never soaked into the
brain of the average Shire councillor.
* * * *
“Betel Nut”: On Dec. 18, Joe Williams,
a Brisbane bookmaker, after a day’s fielding
at Goorparoo, went to the enclosure set
apart for cars, and found that his own little
Lizzie was missing. The C.LD. was in-
formed, and after a few days it looked as
though Bananaland had been thoroughly
combed; but still no trace of Liz. The last
hope had vanished when from Cleveland, a
popular seaside resort, 22 miles from Bris-
bane, came news that the errant Ford had
been standing in the main street in a medi-
tative attitude for 14 days. Some spare
betting tickets and other papers belonging
to the owner were scattered about her, and
apparently'Elizabeth would be still ruminat-
ing in the sunshine had not the local ser-
geant’s son brought home one of the tickets.
“H.H.”: Our friend and brother (or
uncle, or cousin, or whatever it may be) is
supposed to know a good thing when he sees
it, as the state of his bank account indicates.
And he plants cotton with assiduity. The
area harvested in 1915 was over 31,000,000
acres. In 1920 it was over 36,000,000 acres.
Uncle used about half the crop to dress him-
self with, and sold the other half abroad for
1750 million dollars —some of it to Australians
who have vast cotton lands of their own, hut
don’t use them. Iron and steel, bread stuffs,
and meat and dairy nrodacts were big export-
ing items, but the best of them wasn’t much
more than half the money-bringer that
cotton was. No wonder, with this bonanza
in his hands,that Uncle took our Trade
Commissioner aside and told him that cotton
wasn’t of much account, and bade him tell
us to stick to wool.
* * * *
“Sierra”: The schooner Helen B. Sterling,
recently abandoned after beihg battered by
a cyclone midway between Norfolk Island
and Three Kings (M.L.), struck trouble at
the outset of her brief career. Launched at
Seattle, as the four-masted auxiliary
schooner Tacoma, her first voyage was from
Port Arthur (Texas) to Sydney with a cargo
of oil. Flying the Norwegian flag she left
port in October, 1918, and nine months
later, with both Diesel engines out of action,
sails blown away, and partly dismasted, she
staggered into Moreton Bay for repairs.
Thence she was towed to Svdney, and passed
through the Heads exactly 12 months out
from her loading port. Sold in Sydney, her
engines were removed, and, under the
Yankee flag, she plied between N. S. Wales
and Maoriland in the coal and lumber trade
till the finish—to the great grief of a flotilla
of little ships, flying the Australian flag, and
Australian- or M.L.-owned, which the big
fellow and his sister pushed out.
TAXATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Persia coined twenty siglos to the daric
(The daric was of gold and worth a pound) ;
And so a method Egypt thought barbaric
Set the large wealth of empire circling round.
In old Persepolis and Ecbatana
“Give us a sig.” the down-and-out would plead;
And thus in very early times began a
Fine trade in histories of want and need.
Old Tyre had built her trade on notes of credit;
The names of shipping kings ruled every sea.
One hieroglyphic to the man who read it
Meant a full load of apes or ivory.
E’en then, no doubt, in the gay market quarter
Of Tarshish, weary persons hung about
Till the commercial travellers came to barter,
In confidence that one of them would shout.
The old, old tax was levied on good nature
By those who propped the corners of the town;
In grey Jerusalem, I grieve to state, your
Most holy prophet oft was taken down.
But in the realm of Pharaoh, bright and sunny,
They had no need of coin or paper slip ;
There they employed the opposite of money
And paid for slacking with a faithful whip.
Not there were ears with sorrow’s pleadings bitten;
The cadger’s mouth was most securely shut.
The lash was supple; and it is not written
That any whined “Boss, can you spare a cut?”

The woman who uses Palmolive
i
follows a time - honored custom
BACK near the dawn of history, it was
already the wise practice of beautiful
women to rely on palm and olive
oils as the finest aids to skin-health and
beauty.
In the severest climates —in ancient Egypt
and the Levant —these wonderful cosmetic
oils were the great safeguards against heat
and the dry and scorching winds of the
desert.
Thousands of years have passed and there
has been found nothing to displace—or even
to equal—these splendid unguents. Certainly
modern science has been able to blend them
better, to render them purer and more con-
venient in use, for in Palmolive Soap are
contained those same oils which are as
valuable to Australian women and chi dren
to-day as they were in Ancient Egypt.
Wash the face gently with the velvet, creamy
lather of mild Palmolive, and massage it
softly into the skin. When this foam is
rinsed away, it carries off the impurities
which clog the pores and are the foundation
of skin infection and disfigurement.
Palmolive is at once a cleanser, a tonic and a
balm. Though so thorough and beneficial in
action, it is as gentle and mild as a zephyr.
Palmolive cleanliness is different. You will
appreciate it.

“Private Boxer”: I judge from a perusal
of Bernard Shaw’s latest play, “Back to
Methuselah,” that the Garden of Eden was
in Australia. How else account for
“coo-ee” to Adam in Act 1., and Adam s
answering “coo-ee” off-stage?
“L.8.D.”: Some uninformed people are
inclined to doubt John Monash’s statement
that coal dust might explode if a few Ger-
man experts are not allowed to land, it
they really are sceptical of coal dust causing
an explosion, let them spill some on the
sitting-room c£»rpet.
“Sixenate” : The Sydney newspapers have
been full of money troubles. An old man
named Lucre collapsed in the street at
Campsie and among the names of people
who offended the law, were robbed, met with
accidents or attempted suicide were Cash,
Pounds, Penny. Money, Coyne, Gold, Rich
and Spratt—all inside a week.
Mrs. Crawford, who went out at Townsville
(N.Q.) the other day, at 78, was long ago a
weaver in Glasgow, and she helped to make
the canvas exhibit that won the first prize at
the Crystal Palace Exhibition. The canvas
was later on converted into sails for the
Royal yacht Britannia.
Fred Salmon is another example of the
debilitating effects of the North. Though
now 65 he recently travelled with pack- and
saddle-horse from Chillagoe to Thargo-
mind ah (Q.). Salmon came to Australia
35 years ago, and in one prospecting tour
crossed New Guinea, travelling through
country that had never before heard a white
man’s footfall.
“T Q. 1.” • In the old cemetery at Port
Arthur (Tas.)—the Isle of Death—where
bond and free were buried, there is one open
grave which has remained open since the
abandonment of the settlement. The yarn
goes that the convict grave-digger, with an
eye to the future, dug the hole for his own
corpse, and carefully watched it as long
as he remained in the settlement. But he
died away from Port Arthur, and no one
has interfered with his little dugout since.
Among Australians who are doing some-
thing for a country that has done very well
by them, H. L. White, of Belltrees, near
Scone (N.S.W.), takes a leading place. His
gifts to the Mitchell Library (Sydney) and
the National Museum (Melbourne) run into
tens of thousands of pounds, and no doubt
in due time other items from his collections
at Belltrees will go the same way. No other
Australian has spent half as much on orni-
thology. His collectors have been all over
Australia, in the islands of Torres Straits
and the Gulf of Carpentaria and on the
little-known Recherche Archipelago, and his
hoard of Australian birds’ eggs is easily the
best in the world.
A little note from Out Beyond:—
We live in a tent nearly 20 miles from any town,
and an unfinished railway-track is the only relief in
a monotonous landscape consisting mostly of in--
terminable scrub. Our neighbors are too distant
for us to visit, and, anyhow, they are mostly from
Southern Europe. We have two kiddies who help
us to battle for a crust. The elder is five, and so
far has not attended any school, but she owns a
decent memory and a sense of humor. Santa Claus
couldn’t call on us, we were so far from the beaten
track, but at Christmas I brought home a spotted
terrier puppy and a black kitten for the kiddies.
Five-year-old promptly christened them, and now
the little tyke, with a taffeta ribbon and a fancy
bow behind its ears, is Betty Patterson, and mention
of Souter brings pussy mewing to its saucer at the
double.
To Mabbott, official secretary to the Gov-
ernor, and to the newly-knighted Justice
Cussen, the Lawson Government probably
owes its existence, although neither secre-
tary nor Judge set out to save life. Mab-
bot't decided that it would be wrong for
him to assume that any returning-officer
would be dilatory and not forward the
Assembly election writs on the appointed
last day, and, therefore, did not send out
hurry-up wires. The result was that several
writs were late. As a Speaker had to be
elected and votes for preserving or destroy-
ing a Ministry were precious, thb situation
was awkward. Cussen, as Commissioner for
swearing-in members, postponed the proceed-
ings for a day. The alteration suited every-
body, but most of all the Ministry, which
expected (then) to be despatched. On that
extra day the split in the Farmers’ party
was completed.
“T. 0.1.” : Reverting to the Irish in early
Victoria, the first Speaker, Francis Murphy,
was a Cork man, son of the keeper of Cork
gaol and superintendent of exiles destined
for Botany Bay. No doubt Murphy, who
came to N. S. Wales in 1836, met some who
had passed through his father’s hands. The
second Speaker, Charles McMahon, son of
a former Master of the Rolls in Ireland,
was a Dublin man. The third was Charles
Gavan Duffy, son of John Duffy, grocer, of
Monaghan’. ' After him came McMahon
for a second term, then Peter Lalor, son of
a Carlow civil engineer who had a seat in
the House of Commons.. Seventeen years
elapsed before another Irishman got into the
chair, -and he was Frank Madden, who also
hailed from Cork. Of Chief Justices, the
first, aßeckett, was English, but the suc-
ceeding four —Stawell (Cork), Higinbotham
(Dublin), Madden (Cork) and Irvine
(Down) —were Irish.
Viscount Ullswater, who used to be
“Jimmy” Lowther and was for 16 years
Speaker of the Commons, has called attention
to the fact that the Speaker of that House
is no longer entitled to be spoken of as the
First Commoner. He was till 1906, when
Edward VII. decided that the Prime Minister
should rank among the great officers of
State. The head of the Government was
then given precedence also over all peers
except the Lord Chancellor and the Arch-
bishops of Canterbury and York. Incidentally
Ullswater throws doubt upon the appropri-
ation by Speakers, as a right, of the chairs
in which they sat. If the furniture was not
taken habitually it seems to have been
collared in some cases, at any rate. One
chair was presented to the Vic. Parliament
by Governor Manners-Sutton (afterwards
Viscount Canterbury), who said (and no
doubt said truly) that it was the one in
which his ancestor Charles (the first
Viscount) sat in the Commons when he was
Speaker. It is now in Federal Parliament
House —or was recently.


Now for the New Rolls
A whole evening ahead of them
in which to enjoy the new rolls.
It is specially during these "even-
ings at home” that one most fully
appreciates the truly amazing pos-
sibilities of the player-piano to
entrance and thrill. Particularly
such a player as the New Beale
an instrument with a technique
and tone control far, far in ad-
vance of many manually profici-
ent musicians. It possesses more
desirable features for the perfect
soulful rendition of music than
have hitherto been obtainable in
a single instrument.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Frank Ferguson, who for the past 10
years has framed the long-distance handicaps for the
V.A.A.A., died from a paralytic stroke (his second)
recently. He belonged to the Melbourne Harriers’
Club —the oldest in Australia- —for more than 20 years
and was a useful member of the Royal Blues.
+ * * .
A third coin has lately been introduced
into the game of two-up, to give a majority decision
every throw. In a recent prosecution in Adelaide,
defending counsel had the nerve to argue that there
was no case to answer, as the game played was not
two-up at all, but three-up, a quite different thing,
just as bridge is not whist. The Court brushed'this
aside as airy persiflage—or words to that effect —
and fined the players.

“Mac”: Re “Pongo’s” par. about Mick
Rush’s row of 72 miles (B. 12/l/’22) in one day on
river water. I rise to record the fact that the Nicholson
Bros. (Bill and Jack), of Harrington (N.S.W.), in
order to spend Christmas with Dad and Mum, rowed
from Seal Rocks to Manning Heads (N.S.W.) in a
17ft. pulling boat carrying about 3ewt. of lumber.
Leaving Seal Rocks at 4.30 p.m. on Christmas Eve
they were off the Manning Bar (about 40 miles) at
6 a.m. next morning, but as the sea was too lumpy
for them to cross in they pulled on to Crowdy Bay,
beached their boat till the sea went down and then
returned to the Manning and crossed in. Their father,
who was born in the Shetlands, built the boat in
which the boys did their trip and is the proud
father of 10 good Australians.

“15-30” : A writer who attempts to rank
the world’s best tennis players in a recent number
of the English National Review does Gerald Pat-
terson the injustice of placing him fourteenth, while
Norman Brookes and J. O. Anderson are given the
eighth and tenth positions. No doubt Anderson has
earned his place by his recent fine work in America,
but until he meets Patterson he can’t be rated so
much above him. Patterson, it must be remembered,
has been a world’s champion at Wimbledon, and it
is pretty certain that the game he is playing nowa-
days, open, as it may be, to exploitation by Tilden,
will lift him as high as Anderson and certainly
higher than Brookes, who has dropped right out as
a singles player, and on present form isn’t among
the world’s leading 20, though Hawkes and O’Hara
Wood, who are his superiors, are not included by the
English writer among the first 50.

“Pongo”: Irex lias been sold for £4O to a
Solomon Islands man. Donnelly built her to the
order of crack open-boat skipper Nick Johnstone in
the early ’eighties. She afterwards passed into Mark
Foy’s hands. Foy took her to England, where she
was defeated by the Maid of Kent, sailed by Mrs.
Wylie. Irex has probably won more prizes than any
other open-boat in Sydney—among them the first
inter-State 22ft. championship. Another venerable
Port Jackson flier is Adelphi, which at 40-odd is
still winning races. Built by Langford, of Miller’s
Point, she was purchased by A. Fitzhardinge for
£lOO. The Balmain enthusiast won his £lOO in
Erizes within a year, and only a few months back
e sold her at the original purchase price. But the
deep-keeler Magic is the grandfather of the lot, being
just on 50 and withal one of the staunchest vessels
in Australia.
Although the Kangaroos lost the ashes
and won fewer matches than the 1911-12 team, they
scored more points in the aggregate than any com-
bination that has gene north. They played 36 games
and won 27, scoring a total of 763 points against 248.
Blinkhorn played in most matches and notched most
tries (39), though Horder, who appeared in 24 matches,
totted up more points by hoisting 11 goals in addi-
tion to 35 tries. Burge, whom the Woodbines
consider the greatest forward of all time, was third
with 115 points (33 tries 8 goals). Duncan Thomp-
son was the only other sojourner to reach the century:
his tally is 105 points (3 tries 48 goals) in 26
matches. Thompson hoisted the most goals. Of
the 28 players Pearce was the only one who didn’t
score a point, although the veteran played in 21
games, and had a big hand in the tries that other
players recorded.
* * * *
A lot of things have happened to Lionel
Attwill (re-christened Blackfella) since he ran
so badly at Perth. C. B. ICellow, who took
over the entire ownership of the black colt,
put him into Holt’s charge, and that shrewd
trainer advised an operation on the animal
that ran third in last Caulfield Cup, and promised
to distinguish himself in the Vic. Derby. The com-
bined change of nature, name, stable and ownership
ought to work wonders in Lionel Attwill if he has
sufficient horse-sense to understand what is expected
of him. There certainly seemed big possibilities in the
gay deceiver who formerly carried Mackay’s colors.
His Caulfield Cup performance was good, suggesting
that had he been allowed to run his own race in
some previous events he might have led from end to
end. But there was only one means of encouraging
the brute to be trustworthy, and that means has
now been adopted.

“Tren”: Young TV. M. Woodfull (Vic.)
has followed up his 169 (n. 0.) against the South Aus.
colts with 227 (n. 0.) against the N.S.W. second XL
And he is still not class enough for Vic.’s Sheffield
Shield team! He had never played pennant
cricket till last Saturday, but was selected
against S. Aus. because of his phenomenal scoring
at Maryborough, where he captained the Public Ser-
vice XI. In 1919-20 his average was 94 ; in 1920-21
it rose to 195.25 for 11 innings (seven times not out),
with three centuries and four times into the eighties.
He also scored 51 for a Ballarat XV against the
Englishmen. This year his average soared to 482
after playing four innings of 63, 174, 149 and 96,
in the last three of which he carried his bat. He
then got his chance with the colts. He has one
record that is unique among class batsmen—he has
never been clean bowled. And yet he plays forward
to everything, even when turning the ball to leg,
and is always looking for runs. South Melbourne
has secured him: he is now a teacher at the Williams-
town High School. His father is the Rev, T. T. B.
Woodfull, who was a fellow-worker with the late
Judkins in the days when Bulletin readers knew
the famous anti-booze firm as Woodkins and Jugfulls.
“0.K.”: Cable mention of a huge racing
swindle in England, the victims of which are said
to have parted with £3,000,000 in all, revives
recollections of Kerr and Benson’s famous turf frauds
of some 50 years ago. Benson was a Yiddish rogue
of talent and address. At his instance a bogus copy
of Lond.on Sportsman was mailed to a number of
likely “marks.?’ This faked sheet featured' a story
of wonderful success attained by a select syndicate
of punters who had at last been boycotted by the
whole community of bookmakers. The syndicate,
according to the sham newspaper article, was
suddenly deprived of its dishonest means of liveli-
hood by the refusal of bookies to accept further
wagers from the same deadly source. The ring of
jockeys and plungers could no longer back their
dead certs, except through the kind agency of
persons unknown to the books; hence the desire
of the conspirators to communicate with anyone will-
ing to execute commissions on their behalf. The
printed yarn, which had all the face value of a
disinterested editorial article, fetched replies from
many places, including Paris. Volunteers requested
the pleasure of investing any money confided to them
by the syndicate, and then Kerr and Benson forwarded
bank-notes or drafts with strict injunctions re the
identity of the bookmakers who were to be operated
upon. The bookmakers were themselves of course.
Their own money came back to them, plus large
sums which the deluded agents were sending on their
own account. In thjs way fortunes were netted. A
French countess lost so many thousands that she went
to the police, and finally, Kerr and Benson and
two ’tecs, Druscovitch and Meiklejohn, were tried
and sentenced.

The alluring scenery and picturesque

away on Tuesday night—carefully, one
hopes, for some of the costumes are a bit
the worse for wear. On Wednesday “The
Yeomen of the Guard” will be revived at
Sydney Royal for three nights and a
matinee. On Saturday “Dorothy” will re-
mind Mr. and Mrs. Subbubs how their young
hearts used to flutter when Charles Ryley
(or someone) saiig “Queen of My Heart.”

Like the Sydney Parliament, the panto at
the Criterion is in process of dissolution.
The gap will be tilled on Saturday by a
magician called Nicola, who is alleged to be
able to do anything in his esoteric line of
business short of transforming the Dooley
deficit into a surplus.

Sydney Tivoli bill seems to be running on
the rule that one good turn deserves another.
The big new combination is the Cahill-Brooke
couple—Teddy Cahill of the magic touch and
the smashing chords at the pinno, and his
tenor friend singing favorite old love songs
till every wqman in the house leans forward
with a thirsty look about the lips. The
Italian waiter Cestria is a gay bird; there’s
a giggle waiting around the corner of every
trick. Con Moreni’s “Swieet Italian Love”
is flavored to the requirements of the audi-
ence, and the marvellous Togo still makes a
penny go further than anyone else in Sydney.
Then there’s Klla Shields, who still sings
about the Army and the Navy, and that
pathetic Burlington Bertie who wears his
monocle to keep his face from slipping. Bert
Gilbert’s new sketch, “Knuts and Madeira,”
is a great joy-maker; and Ivor Llewellyn find
the Muslcaleys are good, too.

Katherine McDon-
ald’s subterfuge
this week at the
Strar.d is Marion
Hoyte, who gets
into frightful diffi-
culties ; but a kind
earthquake inter-
venes to smooth
things over. Mathe-
son Lang makes
the wonder and the
beauty of “Carni-
val” for Globe
patrons; Tom Mix
rides with anger
in his heart at the
E mpress and
Maje s t i c and
Hoyt’s weighs in
with all the allur-
ing “props” of a
desert island and
a marriage between
the “Shark Mas-
ter” and a fair
castaway, at which
neither registrar nor padre assists.
At Melbourne Majesty’s an unwonted heat-
wave last Saturday gave a seaside air to
the legs of the “beach and stage guild” in
the chorus and ballet department, and the
naturally hard voice of the principal boy
sounded all the better for being rather limp.
“Babes in the Wood” has not given the
understudies much opening up to now. Last
week-end, however, Floie Allen, instead of
Nellie Leach, shared the p.b.’s task of put-
ting the restless Babes to bed, and the change
of personality was not unwelcome, though the
vocal attainments of Floie are not .pro-
digious. Her top note certainly breaks the
silence, but doesn’t smash it up.
* * k-- *
Bluebeard continues to suffer strange
humiliations from his disloyal subjects at
Melbourne Princess’s, where the panto, in-
variably happens 12 times a week and Nellie
Kolle’s full contralto rendering of a ballad
in five acts is evidently appreciated by her
admirers as an effort of endurance. The
longer the principal boy takes to deliver her
inessage the more they are impressed by it,
seemingly. Outside of Jim Gerald, as the
well-beloved Dame, and Nellie, and the
buxom Fairy, and a mixed crowd of princi-
pals, there are “turns” in the course of the
Fullers’ panto. Ferry the Frog, the Flying
Winskills and the impersonator of Charlie
Chaplin are forces to be reckoned with, ani
an orthodox transformation scene is a finale
after many people’s own heart.
“A Night Out,” bearing little or no like-
ness to the farcical comedy that Harry Paul-
ton brought to Australia years ago, appears
set for a fairly long innings at Melbourne
Royal. The music may not positively im-
prove on acquaintance, but it is not less like-
able on a second hearing. Maude Fane gets
the best of it, perhaps, in “Avalon” and
“Just like a Gipsy” (a duet with the grave
and tuneful Plunkett), and maybe she would
have the best of the comedy, too, if her

partner in forced giddiness were not Frith,
who somehow fails to harmonise with the
little lady. Frith, funny in his extravagance
of style, resembles nothing on earth, and
was better suited to the exuberant activity
of Dot Brunton than to the demure humor
of Maude Fane. Their calamitous flirtation
is a very unreal affair, whereas the dialogue
between Madge Elliott and Cyril Ritchard,
as they rest their weary bones on the iron
seat against the garden wall, has the hall-
mark of nature. When Madge asks of her
artless captive “Where did you learn to
eat?” she conveys to the audience a sense
of the young man’s crude, unprincipled
appetite. One can picture him stowing away
yards of menu in the innermost recesses of
his being, while the watchful syren wonders
whether his capacity for tender passion will
be large in proportion. The most indubit-
ably French character in “A Night Out” is
Cecil Ivellaway as the father of the four
fair flapper daughters, a man whom excite-
ment strikes speechless when anyone else’s
young daughter gives him the glad eye, or
any .sort of eye atall. But there is no
hint of Gay Paree in Field Fisher’s story
of the beetle trap that rings a bell when the
evil insect turns a treadmill preparatory to
getting crushed underfoot. At last week’s
matinee Percy Claridge cut a small and
harmless figure in the part where Plunkett
usually warbles concerning Hotel Pimlico.
Also Miss Gertrude Boswell took Millie
Engler’s place as the terrible missus, and
gave new interest to domestic 'life in Frith’s
studio, where Art is a weirdly strange hobby.
At Melbourne King’s the well-worn bill
holds good. Matrons who would curse their
liege lords for doing likewise are full of
sympathy for John D. O’Hara when he
cleans the family’s boots in the drawing-
room and encourages his winsome niece
(Doris Kendal) in the artful practice of
shelling peas in the same apartment, with a
view to ensnaring the affections of a seraphic
young capitalist before the other girl can
get to work on him. O’Hara is understood
to be an old darling, or an elderly arch-
angel, and the fact that womankind in
general would love to sit beside him on the
sofa and comb his silver locks explains-why
“The Laughter of Fools” has a financial punch
in it. “For as the crackling of pork out of
a pot, so doth this play appeal to the taste
of the uncritical” (King’s, 1922), as the
Scripture doesn’t exactly say.

quite wonderfully. As for Carrie Lanceley and
her musical accompanists, Melbourne seems
likely to talk about this familiar Sydney
attraction. The soprano has a beautiful
voice, and no ordinary concert singer of
local reputation is, in this critic’s opinion,
so well qualified to assist the education of a
Tivoli audience. Wilkie Bard came back
in good form; both he and his wife were
more effective than ever in the dualogue of
the stage washer-lady and her persistent foe.
It was sandwiched between “Chrysanthe-
mums” and “The Railway Porter,” and
the house could have done with some more.

“Thunder Island” heads Hoyt’s attractions
in Melbourne. It is the romance of a shapely
squatteress, who gets an unexpected rein-
forcement when she and her brother are
attacked by sheep-thieves. The trouble hap-
pens in Mexico, where the prevailing fashion
in hats makes the mildest cut-throat look
terrible. In “The Moth” Norma Talmadge
has the idea of being another Cleopatra, but
the available Aritonys and Caesars are not
inspiring, so she decides on plain affection.
The screen at the Majestic is laden with
Blanche Sweet in “Her Unwilling Hus-
band.” The heroine pretends to own a hus-
band to make a former lover jealous, and
she has a hard time when explanations are
required to prove that her bogus marriage
was an innocent prank. Also running at
the same house is “The Secret of the Hills,”
wherein heavy-fisted Antonio Moreno dis-
perses the boredom of the most blase stoush-
student. Elsie Ferguson, as a mild New
England girl with secret stage ambitions,
keens to the front in “Footlights” at the
Melba; and some bathing sirens in “Up in
Mary’s Attic” are doubling the popularity ~f
the Britannia.

A Melbourne picture-show :
O. Hampel, who is giving another exhibition at
the jAthenamm, warms the eye with some sunny aspects
of sherbrooke and Yarra Glen. One of his best is
“Th/; Blue Valley, Sherbrooke,” and he hangs another
happy picture of the same scene from Grendon, painted
in a simple, effective style. Still another impression
of the Valley on a much larger scale is not so suc-
cessful : the view seems hardly worth the canvas.
Glimpses of Yarra Glen and the razor-edged Dividing
Range behind appear in several frames, and the hand-
ling suggests that the artist is throwing off the
gloomy influence that was responsible for “Dawn and
the Patriarch” (No. 35), whose realism is almost
repellent. Hampel, however, is not a blue-sky
specialist. He scores in some faithful studies of
dull weather, particularly in “A Grey Day on the
Yarra,” and his rendering of mountain mists is also
pleading, though the transition from the ghostly back-
ground to the sharp green foliage in the foreground
in ijfo. 27 is a bit too sudden. And there is a bril-
liant “Carnival” that stands out from its neighbors
like!a dish of trifle on a tray.of bath buns.
;Jc
Another .affliction is being nobly borne by
the! inhabitants of Pentridge, Melbourne’s
principal gaol. They are now the victims
of Unpleasant Sunday Afternoons, when
well-meaning but prosy lecturers talk to
them on subjects mostly outside the audi-
ence’s ken. Prisoners are no different from
most other men in their tastes, and bore-
dom will out in subdued shuffling and wan-
dering eyeballs when some professor tries
to take them for, say, a ramble among the
wild flowers of Patagonia. What the citi-
zens of Pentridge want is a bit of comic
song, or a couple of jugglers, topped off with
the view of a pair of jazzing legs issuing
from a scrap of ravishing skirt. The last
time they were really entertained was when
a mirthful and clever barrister grave them
delicious imitations of several Judges The
applause was so dreadful on this occasion
that it was decided by the authorities to gK
the Sabbath o^! 118 ' in keeping with
“Wilfrido” on another kind of show ■—
H T ° P^:. author of “Fair and Warmer”
and Our Little Wife,” and probably the most dar-
ing writer of risque farce in America, has got into
hot water over his “Demi-Virgin,” a farce dealing
with movie life in California. Even the hardened
theatre fans” of Broadway jibbed. The producer
was arrested, charged with producing an “immoral
impure play', with an intentional appeal for box-
office profit to lustful, licentious, morbidly erotic
vulgar and disorderly minds,” and bailed ‘ out on
bonds. The adjectives—not mine—recall the criti-
cism directed towards Ibsen’s “Ghosts” when it was
first shown in England. Recently, in Berlin, Arthur
Schnitzler’s “Reigan” was removed by the authorities
from the boards. No one who has read this
cycle of dialogues by a consummate artist can deny
that “Reigan’s” appeal is primarily lascivious and
only secondarily artistic. But an entirely different con-
sideration should apply to a play that is not porno-
graphic, although it offends in the sense that it is
disagreeable. “Euthanasia,” written by Winifred
Graham, the novelist, in collaboration with Dr. de
Gaux, the brain specialist, deals with the vexing
question whether a doctor and a parent have the
right .to. destroy the life of an imbecile boy who
stands in the direct line of inheritance to a baronetcy,
and, incidentally, their right to check congenital
idiocy when it is recognised. The Censor placed an abso-
lute han on its representation at the Grand Guignol,
where such horrors in the grotesque and the ludicrous
as “The Old Women,” “The Kill” and “E. and 0. E.”
liaye been, and are still being, exhibited by Jose
Levy. The Lord Chamberlain gave no reason: he
simply interdicted the performance unconditionally.
He was wrong. No play that honestly endeavors to
present a difficult problem in a manner that is decent
should be banned simply because the public has grown
used to plays that are cheap, tawdry and psychologi-
cally idiotic.

“Dr. Nil”: Apropos “Snell” about Dan
Barry (B. 26/1 /’22). Dan brought his
famous co. to Balaklava (S.A.) more than
25 years ago. There was a gap in their
itinerary, so they stayed and played from
Friday to Monday in our “Institute,” and
after the play (written for Dan by Miss Dora
Mostyn, who played a street-arab and did
it as well as Jennie Lee) the boys would roll
up and hobnob with the hero, villain, heavy
father, walking gent., juvenile lead and
comedian. (Ladies not admitted.) On the
Saturday we played the co. a cricket match.
It was summer, and the speargrass and the
barley-gra.ss were thick and full of seed. On
the Monday night, towards the end of the
play, when the villain had just been foiled or
something, and the heavy father asked “What
shall be his punishmentV Hanging were
too good for him !” the low-comedy man said.
“Put grass seeds in his socks!” There was
no more drama after that.

POVERTY
POINT
“Ancient Prompter”: As “The Private
Secretary” has died, there is little profit in
discussing the way the last revival was
treated by the players. But may I assure
“Digger Strorat” (B. 2/2/’22) that he is
wrong in assuming that the old piece was
ever played in English in any other than the
style of farce —and broad farce at that? He
speaks of reading the ’script. Is he refer-
ring to the German original? Quite pos-
sibly one could find there an act “clouded
with mysterious suggestion in a gentleman’s
manor.” In our very free adaptation we
got, instead, some rapid-fire, farcical expedi-
ents in the Hawtrey manner. And they
were the making of the show, as the present
writer happens to know. It is the first
time I have heard of “sentiment” in connec-
tion with the ancient mirth-provoker and—
let me whisper it! —I was a member of the
original cast when Hawtrey produced it in
England in 1883.
“E.F.”: If the Sydney revival of “Pri-
vate Secretary” has been played on Ameri-
can break-neck farce lines, as “Digger
Strorat” complains, it certainly does not give
the rising generation an idea of the farcical
comedy that Frank Thornton earned so
much good Australian money with. Thorn-
ton’s success in the early performances was

MADEIRA,” AT

TIVOLI.

shared by Henry Harwood, and he was the
most deliberate of comedians as Uncle
Cattermole. In any case, I can’t see how
the atmosphere of the original production
can possibly be imparted to the second act
of a modern revival. Spiritualism was a
new craze, or there was a new boom in it,
35 to 40 years ago. To-day it has been
thoroughly vulgarised.
“Fax”: Touching the allegation by “The
Englishman” (B. 2/2/’22) that Wilkie
Bard has deteriorated a lot in the last 15
or 20 years and now says “every blessed
thing twice over,” it seems to me that if he
didn’t he wouldn’t be true to the type he
represents. Repetition is characteristic of
both the men and women whom Wilkie Bard
talks for. Nor have I heard him say any
blessed thing twice over in any character
where the repetition would not be true to the
creation. Fourteen years ago I heard him
at the London Pavilion, and was not speci-
ally impressed. To-day he keeps me enter-
tained for an hour at a time.
“Thorold Waters”: Hungarian Arthur
Nikisch, now dead, had no rival as a con-
ductor of the greatest music; but he was best
with Tschaikowsky. He was not as much a
showman as Henry Wood, or as pedantically
great as Richter, but he possessed stronger
dynamic force than any other two conductors
combined. Nikisch’s niece, Elena Gerhardt,
is a dramatic singer who stands in a class
by herself as a lieder interpreter, but she
owed much to the fact that Uncle Arthur,
besides being the world’s greatest baton-
wielder, was also probably its finest piano-
forte accompanist. He played for nobody
but Elena.
“0.K.”: “T.R.H.” (B. 2/2/’22) tells
again the yarn which misrepresents Henry
Irving as having collapsed on the stage after
saying “Into Thy Hands, O Lord.” They
did happen to be the last words spoken by
Irving in the last part he played, but he
didn’t collapse on the stage. After changing
his clothes he drove to his hotel with one of
his staff, and in the hall of the hotel said
“Give me a chair.” Then he died. All the
stories of stage deaths I have heal’d appear

to have been faked more or less. The most
tragic decease within my personal experience
was that of Federici, the basso, who on the
first night of a season of “Faust,” at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, died not on the stage, but
under it, wearing the red garb of MepMsto-
pheles. The last I saw of him was when he
was going down the trap to the mimic Sheol,
with his hand on the shoulder of Leumane,
who played Faust. Federici was a very bad
case of heart disease; his trouble had reduced
his fine voice to a tuneless parody of its old
self, and the excitement of a first night in
an exacting part finished the poor fellow.
“Strorat”: Emelie Polini is to return to
the local boards a few weeks hence in “My
Lady’s Dress.” Frank Harvey will lead with
her and a good support has been secured.
George D. Parker, who produced “Adam and
Eva” and “Scandal,” will have the staging
of the piece.
“Cadenza”: There would be a good deal
more point in Gibson Young’s par (B.
2/2/’22) if he could prove that Percy
Grainger and William Murdoch are the un-
willing exiles they are alleged to be. I
know it must seem sordid to mention the
commercial side of the case to Mr. Young,
but concert-managers are neither mints nor
philanthropists, and their inability to supply
him with the musicians he craves for is due
to the artists’ financial hunger.
“Hamfat”: “East Lynne” is to be intro-
duced to Australian screens shortly. The
film version brings the action of the story
down to modern times, so apparently “Little
Willie” will be “Young Bill,” Isabel will
meet with her accident in a motor smash,
and I suppose Levison will take the lady to
a night club. An American film without a
night club seems an utter impossibility.
“Cornstalk”: “Ex-Englishman” (B.
19/l/’22) says that the Rev. Robert Spald-
ing type of curate (“Private Secretary”)
cannot exist to-day. Like "Ex-Englishman”
I have played the part, but 1 deny that
either Spaldings or Cattermoles are extinct.
I know personally four splendid Spaldings
and one Cattermole, a master painter—an
ideal one. The whole five are in Sydney.
“Minim”: George H. Clutsam, the
Adelaide-born musician, is still to the fore
in Britain. When the last mail left a new
musical play for which he had composed the
score was being taken in hand by Robert
Courtneidge. The title is “Gabrielle.” and
Courtneidge himself is partly responsible for
the book. There was to be a four weeks’
season at the King’s, Glasgow, for a start.
“Struth”: Who says Joe Coyne, as Danilo
in “The Merry Widow,” was ever a matinde
idol in London ? Go to! Likewise get
along! Beautiful Lily Elsie was the matinCe
idol with both sexes, whereas Coyne was the
bald-faced joker who, in 1908 and there-
abouts, already looked a trifle too old to
play the particular kind of goat that Danilo
affected to be. After seeing Coyne in Lon-
don I preferred Higginson in Australia,
for the simple reason that he played the
same sort of goat in a more naturally young
and frivolous manner.
“Mac”: Fred Esmelton, of the silken silver
locks, has deserted. In place of the flesh-
stick he now handles a garden-hose at
Albert Park (Vic.), where he has taken over
a large “residential.” But he can’t keep
away altogether, and he is to be seen some-
tiipes at the back of the dress-circle, sym-
pathisinp- with those who still have to walk
on o’ nights.
"Mac : In the old days Gladys Monerieff
could always earn a good living in Banana-
land. I know, as I gave her her first
professional engagement at the Olympia,
Townsville, with Birch and Carroll. But
Melba heard the voice and gave her verdict,
and pa, ma and Gladys journeyed south. It
was a big risk, but events justified it.
“Hamer”: decile Stevens, although her
reputation in Australia is as a violinist, goes
to Los Angeles to star in a film story
written around her and her fiddle. By the
way, £3OOO was refused for that instrument.
It was originally the property of an im-
poverished Frenchman, who, having received
kindnesses from Cecile’s father and died in
his debt, left him the instrument; and its
real value —it is an Amati —was discovered
only by accident.
“G.Y.”: Pauline, eldest daughter of sing-
ing professor Allen Bindley, will until June
take soprano r6'les in an operatic venture in
Bananaland. She made her d£but in Bendigo,
when she was a mere sapling, as a violin
soloist. Since then she has had tours with
Dufault and has made many appearances in
London. Dad Bindley nourished the voices
of the Castles (Amy, Eileen and Dolly) and
a large batch of smaller fry.
~rbell’ ’: “E.K.S.” gibes at an Allan
Wilkie pamphlet because it refers to “Miss
Hunter-Watts as Portia in ‘Julius Caesar,’ ”
and comments with fine scorn : “It will be in-
teresting to see how this concentration of
Shakspeare pans out,” (B. 2/2/’22). Well,
Brutus’s wife in “Julius Caesar” is quite as
important a Shakspearean female as the other
Portia in “The Merchant of Venice.” Bas-
sanio says, in Act 1., Sc. I, of “The Mer-
chant” :
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.
“Orb”: Australia’s old friend Fred Eng-
land denies that he sang in grand opera with
G. V. Brooke, but admits to lifting up his full
bass in nearly every opera since then. At
present he is the tuneful butcher in “Merrie
England.”
“Second Murderer”: “Charley’s Aunt” is
not to follow “The Private Secretary” at
Sydney Palace, after all, mainly because
Charles Walenn is such a bad “study” that
he cannot swallow the long part of the bogus
lady from Brazil in time. The volatile little
comedian leaves for England, home and
beauty by the next boat, after his long and
successful spin in Australia.
“Sierra”: But those Dago films are not
all drab. There are occasional flashes of
humor. I saw one, “The Life of Christ,”
with Jesus walking on the water, while a
steamer crept slowly across the horizon.
“Ancient Prompter”: Florence Baverstock
says of pantomimes of the long ago (B.
19/l/’22) : “The actors either knew much
about politics and other public affairs or
they assumed that virtue if they had it not.”
It is hardly a virtue in the comedian to talk
politics or crack topical gags nowadays. The
public seems to be “fed up” with politics—
as indeed is proved by its apathy at elec-
tion times. Mention any local or Federal
member’s name, and ten to one the reference
is received in stony silence. Even Billy
Hughes is a dud. A question that moves
the Age to bitter sarcasm and the Argus
to fury won’t arouse as much interest as the'
blessed word “Footscray.” A prominent
comedian in a recent musical comedy tried
night after night to waken the people to a
sense of their responsibilities by pointed
references to current topics, but finally gave
the job up in disgust. “Don’t they ever
read their newspapers?” he asked despair-
ingly. That’s just the trouble —they do!
And as the news-sheet of to-day is all poli-
tics and party, people go to ’ the theatre
in the hope of escaping them.
“T.R.H.”: “Lond.” (B. 26/l/’22) is quite
right to quote, as Ella Shields’s title to fame
in the music-hall world, the fact that she has
been “imitated” by Clarice Mayne. The
latter imitates only the stars. She is the
wife of James W. Tait (the original “That”
at the piano), who was one of the husbands
of Lottie “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay” Collins.
“MERRIE ENGLAND,” AT SYDNEY

Chas. Workman as Walter Wilkins.
“T.W.”: When are we to see the best
English plays of the past two years?
There’s Galsworthy’s “The Skin Game”
and 11. M. Harwood’s brilliant political
satire, “The Grain of Mustard Seed,” which
ran concurrently in theatres next door to
each other for many months. Drinkwater’s
“Abraham Lincoln” has now been revived
for a fresh term of success in London, but
is not yet promised here, arid there are alsd
Clemence Dane’s “A Bill of Divorcement,”
Galsworthy’s “The Family Man” and
Maeterlinck’s fantasy, “The Betrothal.” In
the Brough days we would have had every
one of these.
Ivy Shilling was at the Manchester Opera
House for the current pantomime season.
Barry Lupino was at the Grand Theatre at
Leeds.
“Hamfat”: A Sydney .suburban amateur
club is reviving Congreve’s “The Way of
the World,” a play unspoilable even by ama-
teurs. Yet it was hissed off on the night
of the first production. Congreve faced the
audience, asked it coolly if it intended; to
damn his play, and, the uproar continuing,
said “I tell you this play will be living
when you are all dead and damned.” And
now Suburbia is ramming home the fulfilment
of that prophecy. ,
“Hamer” : “Norbell’s” yarn of the actress
who reminded a gagging actor that Levison
(of “East Lynne”) was, with all his faults,
a gentleman (B. 26/l/’22) recalls Ned
Corlesse, the actor of the purple visage
and velvet coat who died a few years ago.
Once when appearing as an old man in
blood-and-thunder at Newtown, he was being
taunted by the villain about the sins of his
son. Ned spoke a speech which ought to
have ended with “He is still my son.” But
what he said was, “No, sir! My son may
have wronged this poor girl, he may have
murdered the old man, he may have robbed
the bank; but still he is—he is not a
wowser!” The rapturous applause showed
that the sentiment was appreciated.
“Silas”: I had a peep at old-time con-
ditions in a talk with a veteran from the
Actors’ Homes. The name of a very well-
known theatrical identity had cropped up.
“Did I know him?” said the ancient. “Of
course I knew him —nobody better. I
worked with him for years, doing small parts
for five shillings a night. I never got a good
part worth mentioning, and never went any
higher till I left him and got six shillings
a night, and I let him know there were
those who could appreciate talent if he
couldn’t. But I got even with the beggar.”
The old man laughed for two minutes, think-
ing how deftly he had evened things up.
“You see,” he explained, “the big fellow
wanted a man to play Polonius, and there
was nobody available but me. He sent for
me. It was my chance, and I seized it.”
The old man held on to my button, giggling
delightedly. “I made him pay me seven and
six a night—forty-five shillings a week.” The
old man collapsed in a seat chuckling con-
vulsively. There was little palm-oil in those
palmy days.
CYNICAL FATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ne’er gentlemanly pro. went faster
Upon the rough provincial road
To court professional disaster
Than Whye beneath ambition’s goad
Went with his rare Shakspearean actors
Along the tumbled Gippsland track,
By bullocks drawn, or nags, or tractors
To bear enlightenment outback.
Alas! the natives proved ungrateful,
They met the worthy man with guile;
They’d throw at him a dinner-plateful
Of eggs, and with a weary smile
Through yolk-encrusted blinkers peering
He cried “To be, or not to be!”
The untaught louts insanely cheering
Would land him—“ Now, boys, one, two, three !”
So all along his route the wretches
Threw eggs at him. If) dire despair
Poor Whye would face the lonely stretches
With hen-fruit caking in his hair.
We got our share, we other players,
And on a sudden ceased our pay.
The co., regardless of Whye’s prayers,
Went all to pieces in a day.
Dead broke, a gentleman of leisure,
Poor Whye went tramping through the land.
A horse-policeman had his measure,
And took the good old man in hand.
They gave him fourteen days in prison—
A chance to rest his weary legs—
Because, by hunger urged, he’d risen
And stolen half-a-dozen eggs!

EFFICIENT MILLING on the
ALFRED HERBERT MILLING MACHINES
To-day our products set the World’s Standard for Machine Tools.

As manufacturers of high-quality machine tools it must neces-
sarily follow that we are large users.
A very large proportion of our work is produced on MILLING
MACHINES, and we found that even with the best machines that
it were possible to buy they lacked these three chief factors.
Power, Rigidity and Ease of Operation.
Consequently we were forced to build machines for use in our works
and incorporate certain exclusive features of design.
Customers visited our works for
the purpose of inspecting and selecting
Turret Lathes. Our Milling Machines
in operation arrested their attention,
and they immediately wanted to place
orders. After repeated requests we
decided to manufacture Milling
Machines for the open market, and
produced machines, both vertical and
horizontal types, which immediately
attained success.
The illustrations show the largest
and smallest of the horizontal types.
No. 22 Horizontal Milling Machine. 48 x 18 x 22.
The No. 22 Single-Pulley type has many distinct features, including a patent knee
clamp, which is operated from the front—the clamping having effect along the whole
length of the slide.
The small Pillar Mill will be particularly well appreciated in small shops, where it can
be used for Jig Boring, Keyseating, Slotting, Bevelling, etc., as well as for all classes of Form
and Surface Milling within its capacity.
In our next advertisement we propose illustrating and describing some of the special
functions of operation.

Few better examples of what Napoleon
called “two o’clock in the morning courage” have been
given than the rescue of Milton Goughian from a
shark at Coogee last Saturday. Jack Chalmers, a Sydney
FRANK O'KEEFFE ( Victoria ).
laborer, went out when Goughian was actually fight-
ing for his life. He knew, being a surfer, that
where there is one maneater there is usually another
and that nothing exists which is more helpless in
the water than a human being. There was no par-
ticular obligation on him to go. He has a wife
and family, and is an ex-Digger whom the community
hadn’t treated too well, inasmuch as he has been
out of work for months. And yet something which
is the highest expression of the sporting instinct
led him to take a bigger chance for a stranger than
he ever did for a comrade as a stretcher-bearer in
France. There isn’t much wrong with a race, a
class, or a pastime that can produce such men when
they are wanted.

The Testimonial Match, Australia v. the
Rest, at Sydney Cricket Ground, to Frank
lredale, gave the Victorians, O’Keeffe and Willis,
a chance to show what first-class performers they
are. AVillis, who was looked on as one of the best
bats in the A.I.F. team, is really an international
player, as his 133 against the Australian XI, with
-McDonald probably at his best, indicated. His
only defect was a certain crudeness in the forcing
strokes. O’Keeffe was more orthodox, though work-
manlike and splendid in defence. Gregory bowled
remarkably well on a pitch that helped him, and
lie worried every batsman except the two top scorers.
Oldfield in the Rest’s first innings did not make one
error, the sundries—two in number—consisting of
an impossible leg-bye and a “no-ball.” Mailey
was not persevered with: he ricked his arm while
throwing in. Ryder has developed a longer run
than ever, and the change has added to his suc-
cess-with the bull. With the bat, moreover, he has
jumped from the Hendry class, or thereabouts, to
somewhere j'ust behind the “big four.” The way
he now goes out to meet the ball in the Graham
style is a picture of foot-craft. Scott seemed faster
on Saturday than either McDonald or Gregory did
°J> Friday. But he can’t stay as the tall men are
able to do. There was some lovely cricket between
the showers after the luncheon interval on the
second day, more particularly when Macartney
joined Collins, and afterwards. The outfield was
heavy, but the Gordon champion’s wristy shots
through the slips and past cover caused the ball to
fairly crash against the pickets. He fell to one
of O’Keeffe’s-slows just before the tea interval.
The Oldfield-Armstrong association was calamitous
for the Rest. Both went in for free play, and,
though the ex-Digger’s effort was ehanev, it con-
tained a number of class strokes of the first water.
Armstrong took two hours and 20 minutes to make
m 77 (n. 0.), but it was a clinking exposition of
the game which might have meant a century or more
to a less lethargic performer between the wickets
More interesting than the level batting displays of
the Test reps, was the bowling of Hornibrook. The
tall Queenslander had had all the odds against
him on Saturday—a greasy ball, a bad foothold and
a batsmans wicket—but under the altered con-
ditions of Monday afternoon he tied up even Arm-
strong and repeatedly had the others guessing. He
took the last four wickets, after the tea interval,
tor 107. O’Keeffe, in the Rest’s second knock, at
once set about the business of nroving that his pre-
vious feat was no fluke. He batted like a champion
tor his 144—sometimes brilliant, always safe. H. S
Love’s exhibition was also meritorious, and none of
the XI s- erark trundlers discommoded the first four
colts in the least. Willis was n.o. when the declar-
ation came. What this match, which has been
1 ought; out hard under the most diversified
conditions, tends to show is that Australia has at
least one more XI which is the equal, all round, of
tnat which was so successful against England.

Whitty is beginning to make his mark
again on cricket in Adelaide. His 5 for 41 was the
main feature in the beating of Port Adelaide by
Glenelg, which has a useful but undistinguished lot.

second to East Torrens, who are unbeaten so far.

Auckland (322 and 0 for 47) downed
AVellington (164 and 203) in the Plunkett Shield
(M.L.) premiership final. In the round of major
Association matches, Auckland won three, AVellington
two. Canterbury one; Otago were beaten in all three
matches.
L. R. Anderson’s Eun-na-Mara, of the
Briguton Yacht Club, won the V.R.Y.A. Challenge
Cup on Corio Bay (Vic.) on Saturday. Starting off
scratch she made good use of her spinnaker in the
light X.E. breeze, and, after the first round, had it
all her own way. Petrel, which beat Eun-na-Mara
for first place last year by 49sec., failed to get a
good place in the procession this time. E. Digby’s
Independence (Hobson’s Bay) and the Governor-
General’s Yeulba (Roy r al Y. C.) were second and third
and well earned their positions, considering that their
sail ratings were 49 and 47, compared with Eun-na-
Mara’s 92.
“K.D.”: Anderson’s double is a popular one, a
stroke of luck being overdue in his case. This is
his big black boat’s third season in Melbourne waters,
and till recently she had proved a disappointment.
Idler, winner of the 21-footers championship event,
has also been performing indifferently. Saturday s
feat shows that she likes her old-fashioned lug better
than the freak Marconi rig. Billy Higgins, the
Brighton Yacht Club’s secretary, sails Eun-na-Mara,
her owner shipping as a for’ard hand. “Randie” in
shorts, hanging on to the bobstay as his 9-metre
crack shoots for her moorings, is a familiar sight
off the Middle Brighton Pier, and his unquenchable
enthusiasm has helped to keep the game going in
Port Phillip for the last decade.

(28ft. Ojin.), and was second in the half to club-
mate H. R. Turner. Both are likely to strip against
the Springboks at Sydney next month.
Sydney R.P.A. Yacht Club revived the
Basin Cup race on Saturday after a lapse of nine
.years fhe breeze was sou’-sou’-east at the start,
but later it arrived from all over the place, and
eventually fell almost dead. Bona and Denone struck
trouble with their running gear soon after the start,
and retired, Rawhiti (scr.) being the first to reach
the open water. The scratch boat hauled sheets
inboard for the return journey 23min. ahead of
Scotia, which led Aoma by lOsec. On the punch
home Rawhiti worked in close, whilst the eonces- ,
sion craft stood out, the result being that when
the blow fell sick the seaward vessels gained an
advantage. Still, Rawhiti rolled home first. When
times were adjusted Scotia (75min., T. A. Brockhoff)
was found to have won by 21min.
The R.S.Y. Squadron staged the first of
a series of three inter-State races for 21ft. restricted-
class yachts on Saturday. The Bananaland 'represen-
tatives _ did not start. Milson’s E.O.J. was first
away if the G.-G.’s barge be excepted—it crossed
too soon and had to re-start. A great race followed,
during which most varieties of weather were experi-
enced, including a dead calm and a southerly, the
final battle was between Gumleaf and E.O.J. Mil-
son’s charge sailed a great boat to Bradlev’s, where
she was just in front of Gumleaf. Then both started
a kite-setting competition, and every available stitch
of drapery was sent aloft for the final mile. Gum-
leaf, magnificently handled bv Alderton, eventually
won by a foot, with the G.-G.’s craft half a minute
away, third.

The match at Sydney Stadium on Grtur-
day night was one of those rare affairs that justify
clerics in going to prize-fights without their dis-
guises. It was a meeting of ' champions, Sid
Godfrey, the lightweight title-holder, and Beit
Spargo, undisputed master of the local feathers,
being the principals. The weights were given as
9st. 61b. and 9st. 21b. respectively, but Godfrey
looked half a stone the heavier. A remarkable fea-
ture of the engagement was that the little man kept
Godfrey moving backwards throughout the whole
journey. The Auburn professor’s straight left was
pushed into Spargo’s face with persistent force; the

Golden Cock paid the comparatively large
dividend of £lO 3s. when he won Adelaide Tatt-’s
I .andipap on Saturday. Old Dependence got a
place, but he has lost his dash, and unless the weight-
adjuster proves lenient he can hardly hope to lift
any of the big Adelaide handicaps. St. Speed did
not shine as a weight-carrier in the Lovalty Handi-
cap. Plaintive was in receipt of 381 b. over the
six-and-a-half furlongs, but the record-breaker was
left two lengths astern. In the Juvenile, the Pistol
youngster, Recitation, cleared away from the field.

Two 20 to 1 turnups (one of them a

shorn books at Epsom (Melb.) last Saturday.; Other-
wise it was a good enough day for pickers and
choosers. With Flaviol and Demetrius*—Hugh
Cairns up in eac-h ease—Cecil Godbv won another
two races for George Tye, and whereas Demetrius
looked a rather good thing at odds on, it wanted ■.
lot of mciney to bring Flaviol to 3 to 1 in a market
where three others were heavily backed. More than
one starter in particular failed badly, under sus-
picion of being intended to get merciful considera-
tion in the Newmarket Handicap weights.

The S’African cyclists met the pick of the
N. S. Wales amateurs at Sydney Sports Ground
on Monday night. A. E. Hannan, Australasian 10-
mile champion, won the half from Thursfield; but
the stout ’Bok sprinter took the mile as well as the
quarter from him. Kaltenbrun’s j'ob was a pursuit
affair limited to 10 minutes against W. Coppins,
N.S.W. one-mile champion. The local man was out-
ridden after three miles had been covered in 7min.
All present lined up in the five-mile international
scratch race. It resolved itself into a match between
Coppins and Kaltenbrun, which the Australian won
by a yard in 12min. 16 l-ssec.

Phones Cantrel 1532, 1533,
W. M. Hughes was the only lion the
metropolitan committee of the A.N.A.
managed to snare to its Foundation Day
lunch. When William noted that the pro-
ceedings began with a grace, said by the
Scotchbyterian Moderator Cameron,' and
that soft drinks only were served, he
probably imagined that an hour and three-
quarters wouid see the thing through; but
the time occupied was nearer three hours
and three-quarters. Prolixity could hardly
be charged against the Priminister, as his
contribution didn’t occupy more than 23
minutes, and what he said was mostly
the echo of many former speeches. There
was no G.-G., as Lord Forster was at
Geelong yachting; no Governor, as Strad-
broke had his eye tied up; no Premier, as
Lawson was playing with his kiddies at the
seaside. And no wit, nerhaps because there
was no inspiration in lemonade.
After the shock of a Governor resigning
his job because of the expense, the Apple
Island is sorting the matter out in its
mind. Government House, it has decided,
really is too big for an ordinary family
residence, and there is an idea of turning
Parliament loose in its rambling rooms.
The present Houses of Parliament occupy
valuable space on the water frontage, and
good money could be made by selling it. They
are a simple-living thrifty lot, the Tassies,
and a hint like that, especially from a Gover-
nor is likely to produce results.
But if his new Excellency is driven to a
Hobart boarding-house, the Government really
ought to see that, after a room has been
secured for him for his very own use, he isn’t
crammed in somewhere with four others,
and told to take it or leave it if he is foolish
enough to think he can find another doss at
a moment’s notice during “the season.”
Complaints roll across of that sort of thing
happening at even the swellest boarding-
houses ; and if Hobart wants to keep the
summer visitor who is the butter to its
bread it will have to seriously consider the
question of licensing all lodging-houses—
and delicensing them for misconduct.
Two or three Guv’ment House cars tooted
up to the kerb outside the Theatre Royal the
other night and a house-party bundled into
two boxes for “A Night Out” with Maude
Fane. The house was packed. The squatter
Whitings boxed in splendor opposite the
rainbow-frocked Guv’ment House company.
Mrs. Pohlman had a party in the stalls
entertaining Naval-officer Fitzgerald and his
bride. She is a sister of Hamilton of the
Defence Department, who was also there at
the head of some Repatriation officers.
The Earl and Countess are to give a fancy-
dress ball at Government House on Febru-
ary 10. The girls are rooting out the dresses
they wore at Prince-time, when they had a
gorgeous fancy-dress jazz at St. Kilda.
The Duke of Leinster, who died last week,
had an indirect association with Victoria.
Lord Charles Fitzgerald, who farmed at
Riddell's Creek for many years, was one
of his uncles. The late duke was what the
Scotch call “fey,” and had not figured in
public for many years.
11.M.A.5. Australia, now put out of com-
mission, was once elaborately stocked with
fireworks wherewith Priminister Hughes
intended to impress the natives in ex-German
New Guinea. The trip was booked for the
time before the Expropriation Board took
things over, but political trouble threatened
and it never came off. Hughes missed, a
great opportunity for a fine theatrical show.
He would have had a wonderful stage for
his fireworks. New Britain goes up to a
heap in the centre, and the stretch of Rabaul
harbor is visible from all points. The news
that the Prince would visit New Britain
also proved a dud. Then the Australian
fleet was to make a parade and didn’t.
Then Hughes was to go on the Australia;
he also didn’t. The natives were by this
time disgusted. The lil’ white piccaninny
of the big King he no stooop ; the big ships
of the big white King they no stooop. A
shrug for the whole business. Three times
the natives from the interior planned a
trek to vantage points in the mountains.
Three times the chiefs prepared their best
dances, their joy decorations and their war
togs. Thfee times the nigs climbed the
steep sides of the sacred Mother Mountain
with bundles of brushwood for a huge bon-
fire. But all bunkum that fella lil’ picca-
ninny, and the big ships and the Big Man
on Top—they no stop. Hughes missed a
chance of passing into Papuan mythology.
He and his fireworks would have been
talked and sung about for ages.
Miss Wood, a niece of Commissioner of
Railways Shannon, was altared to Mrs.
Harry Bamford last week. The church
ceremony was at noon, and the gay pink-and-
blue wedding breakfast at the Occidental
was really a lunch party trimmed with cham-
pagne.
On February 1, at Cairns Memorial Kirk,
Captain Donald Ross Cameron, M.C., was
married to Maud Miles. She was of the
J.C.W. Royal Comics in the days of Ettie
Muret and Stella Esdaile. The present
J.C.W. pros, were well represented at the
knot-tying, and Gladys Moncrieff sent good
wishes and a present. Miss Miles was a
pupil of the late Miss Kirby, a sister of the
tenor. For the wedding she wore smart
trappings of duck-wing blue and mole fur
with a cheerful hat of gold tissue. Her
sister, Mrs. Parker, from Healesville, gave
the wedding breakfast.
As successors to Murray Smith and
Edward Officer, over whom the grave closed
a few months ago, the Government has made
John Connell and John Shirlow trustees of
the Public Library and Art Gallery. Both
will have more to say about pictures than
books. A collection of art treasures has
already made the name of Connell familiar
at the National Gallery, and Shirlow is a
discriminating critic as well as an etcher.
Baritone Hubert Ennor is the latest
victim to ambition. Kennerley Rumford
injected the bacillus. Ennor vows that
nothing less than special voice production
lessons in London can provide an antidote.
First aid will be administered in the form of
a benefit concert in the Athenaeum on Feb-
ruary 21.
Kitty Grindlay, the Williamstown girl
who used to be one of Melbourne’s sweetest
singers, was married years and years ago to
a naval officer and went abroad to live.
Her husband, Commander Wilson, has long
been senior officer in the Nigerian marine
service, and his wife put in a dozen years
on the West Coast of Africa, their bunga-
low being at Lagos. The commander has
now retired on pension and has returned to
Australia, bringing his wife with him. The
lady is as bright and chic as ever. She used
to be one of our best frockers, apd the
dreaded West Coast has not devastated either
herself or her genius for dress.
From an Australian in London: —
Mrs. B. J. Fink has returned by the Ormonde to
the Land of Blue Skies. She is the Australian
woman who gave money with both hands to help
Australian war-time hospitals in France. The Harold
Fink Hospital in Park-lane (London), a memorial
to a delicate son who died during the Great Uproar,
was founded by the same fairy god-mother. The
Park Lane haven is still run by a committee, with
surgeon Douglas Shields as presiding genius. A
daughter of Mrs. Fink’s’(the only surviving chick)
married Commander Banbury, R.N., and lives in this
grey isle.
Harrington Lees made his first appearance as
Anglican Archbish. of Melbourne at the autumn
meeting of the Colonial Church Society in London.
He is small, with a boyish countenance, and some-
how you can’t help wondering what he’s doing with
apron and gaiters. He has not yet quite mastered
the geography of Victoria ; he introduced a Rev. F.
Brammall from the northern diocese of Wangaratta
as “the first of my own Australian clergy that I
have the honor to call upon.” Brammall, by-the-way,
told the audience' about the tremendous rains and
floods they have around Wangaratta, where the mud
sometimes keeps people from church. It is probably
the first mention of mud as an Australian plague
and is a pleasant change from drought and dingoes.
Here is Lorna Helms, the bright little
Australian who hides her good looks behind
the greasepaint of the scarecrow domestic,
Elizabeth, in “The Laughter of Fools.” The
point about the
actress’s success,
which is shown by
the laughs she raises
every night, is that,
barring a very brief
season in “The Luck
of the Navy” in
Sydney some months
back, she had never
previously appeared
on any stage, even
in an amateur way.
Apparently it was
Gregan McMahon
who realised her
possibilities. Hear-
ing through a rela-
tive of her stage
ambitions he met
her one day, and
being impressed with her intelligence recom-
mended her to the Firm. McMahon seems
to have picked a promising artist, and the
management is looking upon her with a
favorable eye. Miss Helms, who was born
near The Harbor, is a sister of the Sydney
physiculturist. Another sister is just on the
verge of becoming a doctor.
Nobody in Melbourne was more grieved
to hear of the death of Shackleton than the
wife of Upton Brown, the picture showman
nowadays associated with Hoyt’s. A
daughter of the late James Miller, she was
invited to England to stay with the Wests,
and travelled by the same boat as the ex-
plorer. He sought the society of the bright
your\g girl who could talk of people and
things from a theatrical point of view. And
she, besides being flattered by the friendship
of the celebrity, thought he was the fun of
the world.
D.-E.-M.-G. Charles Bright’s 11-year-old
daughter Mary has for the second time
caught the judge’s eye as the best girl rider
at the Mornington Show.. The little lads'
also scored two first awards for her chargers
Pompey and Bonnie. The whole family is
fiercely enthusiastic about horses. Brother
Mac, who will leave Geelong Grammar next
year to jackeroo in Queensland, gathered
in the Mornington Hunters’ Maiden Plate.
Mrs. A. Iv. Goode has just buzzed through
Melbourne from the Apple Isle on her way
home to Adelaide after representing S. Aus.
at the inter-State
Conference of the
National Council of
Women. The lady
is a most active
worker in public
affairs. She is a
member of the
Board of the State
Children’s Council,
was one of the first
J.P.-esses and did
pioneering work in
the Children’s Court.
She is a censor of
pictures for the Gov-
ernment, and has put.
sound commonsense
into her advice on
movie affairs. She
is president of the
Liberal Women’s Educational Association,
plumps for women in Parliament every
time, and considers that the energies of the
wofnen at the inter-State Conference had
much to do with Tasmania deciding to
tolerate women M’s.P. Herewith is a por-
trait which Lafayette managed to take while
the energetic lady was speeding through
Melbourne.
Four daughters of William Gibson (Foy
and Gibson), who died worth £2,224,000 in
Vic. and £55,000 in N. S. Wales, will benefit
to the extent of approximately £lOO,OOO each
as the result of the decision given by- Irvine,
C.J., that £400,000 set apart for William
Gibson, jun., deceased, is not to go to the
son’s widow and child. A letter to the
executors, accepted as a codicil, was inter-
preted by Irvine to mean that the family
of William, jun., was not to benefit.
Charles H. Ward, a son of Inspector
Ward, of the Kelly days, denies that he is
engaged to Marjorie Clay as mentioned in
this column a couple of weeks back. For
the last 29 years of his life in the force the
inspector was in the detective branch, and
when he retired it was to go into business
in Melbourne.
Vera Pearce, who last appeared here in
“Chu Chin Chow,” has been discovered in
Glasgow playing in musical comedy under
the management of Robert Courtneidge.
Also Glasgow thinks a lot of the handsome
Australian, whose Junoesque shapeliness is
Considered “verra bonnie.”
Henry Penn, piano professor at Sydney
Con., is one of four pugilistic pianists who
will next week assist the Auditorium Orches-
tra to beef out Tschaikowsky’s 1812 Overture
—no, not in relays, but on four separate
pianos. His co-conspirators are Harold
Elvins, Fred Dennett and Fedora St. Ledger.
Before the war you could drop in and
get a passport while you waited. If you
happened to ask if the G.-G. wouldn’t have to
sign it, a diplomatic clerk would explain
that “his Ex. anticipated that you would
want one and has been kind enough to get
one ready for you.” That is all changed
now; but the old system might at least be
applied to 0.8.E.’5, C.M.G.’s and the like.
Then when Hughes dropped into Bendigo he
could fake a bagful of Orders and feed the
dangerously hungry, explaining that George
V. “anticipated you would like one.” This
sort of thoughtfulness would save such a
growl as Mrs. Craig made the other day dur-
ing the Priministev’s visit, when she bar-
racked for badges for some of her neglected
sex.
The frocking in “A Night Out” is as fas-
cinatingly frivolous as the play. Maude
Fane starts in dove-grey with a cloak to
match, which throws up by contrast the
dress for her runaway cafe supper—a cloth-
of-silver affair crinolined at the sides in
mauve and apricot georgette. And her cafe
hat has what look like three birds-of-
paradise plumes. Maude mooches about the
garden in the morning in contrite tears and
a gown made of black lace over white em-
broidery, with just a touch of cerise to keep
her from feeling too mournful. Madge Elliott
starts life in a rose-pink silk, with the
dinky muslin cap and- apron of a lady’s
maid; but when she runs to the inevitable
cafe her fussy frock is amber and ivory and
Fortune’s pink roses. Incidentally, her
dance-impression of a tired girl walking home
in high heels because her young man can’t
afford a cab is one of the cleverest things in
the show.
Walter Kirby ( moustache + a coat of
tan) has returned from a few weeks at
Lome. One night he engaged the local
hall for a concert, and, the weather being
warm, windows and doors were flung wide
open. Midway through the programme
Ivirby discovered that half the trippers in
Lome were sitting on the grass and sand
outside enjoying the show on the nod. The
wrathful tenor at once shut down, telling
those who had paid that the concert would
be repeated for their benefit. Erskine House
lent its hall for a later warble, and the good
gate-money mollified the singer.
John Batman’s remains are receiving
much more consideration than the man
himself evei got, and Melbourne is again
on the verge of coming to blows with itself
as to where they shall eventually lie. They
are at present in the old General Cemetery
under the control of the City Council; but
cabbages are to take the place of kings
there, as the site is to be used for an
extension of the Queen Victoria Market, and
the Council has decided that John and all
the old pioneers with him shall be emptied
into the Fawkner Cemetery. The Old Mel-
bourne Cemetery Preservation League main-
tains to the last gasp that what remains of
John and the rest should be left where they
are; another body of citizens declares that
they should finish up on Flagstaff Hill;
still other individuals plump for St. Paul’s
Cathedral yard and other places. Up till
time of writing Wirths’ Circus and the
Stadium seem to be about the only places
omitted from the list of sites where John
should be finally planted.
The Frankton sea-shore buzzed with
excitement over the local club’s yacht race,
and a hearty cheer nearly cleared the surface
sand from the beach when Colin Harper and
a Syme pal skimmed past the winning point,
with Jack Mann and General Grimwade’s
golden-haired daughter on their back wave.
Afterwards the clubites adjourned to the
medical Woods’ place for tea and cake. The
club, which is not a stupid men-only affair,
held its annual meeting in the Grimwades’
front parlor, and the proceedings ended with
a joyous jazz to the sounds of an amateur
orchestra.
A word or two from Adelaide:—
His Ex., Lady Weigall and suite have booked to
leave by the Osterley on April 24. No previous vice-
regalg left such a blank behind them as will this
well-liked pair.
A star journalist of the ’nineties passed out last week
in Morgan Meyyick. Born in 1865 at Greenock, he was
an old Prince Alfred boy, and after passing his matric.
at the head of the list, joined the news-getters of the
Advertiser. For many years he was sub-editor; then
dropped his blue pencil and took to growing fruit,
tor the last few years he had been an invalid.
The late Charlie Downer, who died last December,
left £5O to the St. Peter’s war memorial fund, and
to the Adelaide Club and the Adelaide Golf Club the
debentures he held in those institutions. The gross
estate is set down at £30,000.
Sir William Allardyce, ex-Governor of the Speck,
Lady Allardyce and party are homing on the Ascanius.
They spent a few hours with the local Exes, while
the boat was in port.
Thelma, the only daughter of C. R. J. Glover, of
St. Andrew’s, North Adelaide, is to say “I will” to
Dr. H. Keith Pavy, at St. John’s Church, on February
23. The bride-to-be and her parents have just returned
from London and Paris, where the trousseau was
purchased, together with a lot of china, plate and
ivories which dad is showering upon his pretty
daughter. Her future home will be in Naracoorte,
in the south-east.
Some da have greatness thrust upon them. Three
new hybrid gladioli have just been raised by Halli-
day and Matthew's, of Aldgate, and one of these,
.with a spike of 28in., has been named “Legh Win-
ser,” after the popular private sec. of his Ex. So
beautiful is the blossom that Lady Weigall is send-
ing corms of it to Queen Mary.
Port Victoria has had an echo of the war. The
Lutheran creed still has a hold in some country dis-
tricts ; but when a service was proposed in a reading-
room at the little port—the room in which the local
roll of honor and photographs of dead soldiers are
hung—the returned men gathered in force and inter-
rupted with patriotic songs. Then a conference was
held, and the service was allowed to go on, but with
a strong hint that it mustn’t happen again. A French
youth who had been prominent in the affair was after-
wards charged with having disturbed the peace; the
residents subscribed to import a lawyer from Kadina
to defend him, and the information was dismissed.
Glenelg - celebrated the Foundation Day holiday
with a pageant of its own founding in 1836. A two-
master was camouflaged to represent roughly H.M.S.
Buffalo, and a more-or-less life-like Governor Hind-
marsh landed from it in a long-boat. Unfortunately
the weather was so rough that the party had to out-
rage history by landing hastily at the pier-head. The
most realistic object in sight was a copy of the
historic gum-tree under which was read the Proclama-
tion of the new province. The tree itself is away
inland, but its deputy was erected at a convenient
spot among the hotels.

A True Delig'ht.
Miss Dorothy Woolley is recognised by the foremost critics
as one of the finest exponents of classical and interpretative
dancing. Her Egyptian dancing is acknowledged to be unequalled.
This charming little artiste thinks the world of Plaza Talcum
Powder, and writes us as follows:
“I have been using Plaza Talcum Powder,
and I like it so well that I am dropping you a line
to tell you how nice I think it is.
“Plaza Talcum Powder is delightful. I think
the way it is put up in a glass container is a great
improvement over the old-style tins, for you can
see for yourself how white and soft it is, and that
the bottle is really full, and I simply love the way
it is perfumed. Its use makes one feel so fresh
and dainty.
“I will tell all my girl friends about Plaza
Talcum Powder, for I feel that I cannot recom-
mend it too much.
“Yours sincerely,
“(Sgd.) DOROTHY WOOLLEY,

AWOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeproof
Hosiery
Lit by six tall tapers that stabbed the dusk
of the transept immediately before the high
altar, the funeral pile of Benedict XV. waited
the chanting of the Requiem Mass by the
lesser pontiffs of the far-flung see of St.
leters. In the solemn austerity of black
and white drapings surmounted by the Papal
crown and keys, the catafalque of the dead
lope towered till it became a cloud whose
shadow fell sombrely over the world. Long
before 10 o’clock, the hour set for the Mass
at St. Mary’s, the cathedral was crowded
out, and when Archbishop Kelly emerged
m his Cardinal’s robe that glowed like a
ru by amidst the black vestments of the
seemingly countless priests and pontiffs, there
wasn t an inch of standing room unoccupied
in the aisles or even on the steps of the
pulpit. Five thousand squeezed into the
cathedral and hundreds who failed to make
entrance seated themselves on the parapet
and grass of Hyde Park opposite.
Like a rich-toned bell the chanting of the
Office for the Dead rang out, and for an hour
the priests’ voices rose and fell, breaking-
now on a sharp crescendo of imploring, or
swelling in confidence of “the Resurrection
and the Life.” No one present is likely
to soon forget the beauty of the Benedictus
led by Dr. Hayden. Outside was the roar of
traffic; passing motors flashed reflections
into the eyes of those in the choir loft; broad
shafts of gold drifted through the amber
windows, finding here the white naval uni-
forms of the. lean brown Italian sailor-men
from the Libia, the leaf-brown of khaki uni-
forms, the new Mayoral robes of office;
gilding the brown or black habit of some
visiting order of nuns; fingering for a
moment the decoration of some Papal knight.
The chanting died, and high and clear,
with the cold beauty of a mountain pool,
the fitst notes of Cherubini’s Requiem irr C'
minor floated over the kneeling congregation.
The Archbishop took his place on the throne
m the sanctuary, and Dr. Hayden, of Wil-
cannia-Forbes, the first Australian bishop
appointed by the late Pope, celebrated the
Mass, assisted in the colorful ritual by a
group of the State’s most distinguished pre-
lates. Presently, when the austere beauty
of the Dies Irae struck every heart, was
there one present who did not feel his robe
of State, his uniform or his habit give place
to that straight shroud that is the final
covering of all flesh and bone?
Twice the sanctuary blazed into light :
once at the Gospel, when every black-and-
white clad figure there bore aloft a burning
taper, and again during the solemn act of the
Consecration. Following the Communion
the lights were extinguished one by one, till
only the tall altar candles were left, and the
six tapers about the bier; the choir burst
into the ascetic splendor of the final passages
of Cherubini’s masterpiece; the last solemn
chant dripped slowly to its close; and his
Sydney flock had prayed the last Godspeed
to its Shepherd.
Captain Sir Pyers Mostyn, M.C., who
arrived by the Ventura, is tl-e head of the
oldest Catholic family in Wales. He is still
in the twenties and is rich r.s Welsh land-
lords go. He went to* France with the Old
Contemptibles, anu was three times wounded.
Llis Ex. and Dame Margaret come to town
on February 27 for a couple of days to
give their blessing to the annual meeting of
the Benevolent Society and the ‘ Sydney
Hospital. Sir Walter will also preside at
the annual meeting of the Railway and
Tramway Institute.
Dame Margaret is a carpenter as well as
all the otiler things. At Llillview she has
been putting in her spare moments making
a model of a two-storeyed dolls’ house for
her little daughters—doing the whole job
herself.
The Dowager Lucas-Tooth and daughter
Yvonne are now at the Australia, after
browsing among the cheeses at Kameruka.
The war-years have been full of sorrow for
the dowager. First her two eldest sons
went, killed in the early terrible days. Then
her husband, the first baronet died. Then the
new baronet, her youngest and last son, faded
away after being war-casualtied. The boys had
left no male heir; but her eldest daughter
had married, and her eldest son came into
the baronetcy.
The Chapter House flung its doors wide
to welcome Miss Henderson, who has just
returned from England, where she has been
busy in the interests of the Women’s Auxili-
ary of the Anglican Board of Missions, miss
Henderson’s job is the pleasant one ot travel-
ling secretary for this body, and the chief
work of the Women's Auxiliary is to pro-
vide extras for the lady-missionaries. Tnat
the parcels often contain silk stockings and
hand-trimmed undies is all to the good of the
Cause and the happiness of the woman in
the wilds. Miss Macarthur Onslow wel-
comed the returned voyager and introduced
Mrs. Frank Dunn and Alice Knox as chair-
woman and secretary of the Auxiliary for
1922. Miss Henderson is now on her way
to Tasmania.
St. John’s, Parlinghurst, was resplendent
one night last week when Nancy Hutton
became Mrs. Arthur Lord, clothing herself
in white satin and old lace for the tr.—sfer.
Four bridesmaids, in heliotrope and yellow,
and a small train-bearer added color to the
bridal queue; and friends Rex Balcombe, of
Coradgery station, and Godfrey Jones stood
by the bridegroom. Nancy’s grand-dad was
General Hutton, and before the family
settled in Rushcutter’s Bay they were on
the land in the Northern State. Arthur
Lord comes from Victoria Downs (Q.), and
is the youngest son of the Lords of Manly.
Matrimony claimed another of Neutral
Bay’s pretty girls last week, when Dulcie
Deuchar became Mrs. Will Burgess. Dulcie.
who with her mother came south from Bris-
bane some years ago, has been among the
northern suburbs’ enthusiastic war-workers
and post-war jazzers. The just-beginniner
husband is a son of the Rev. Dr. Burgess, of
Marrickville.
Tien Hogue (Mrs. Wyatt) is having a
honeymoon to make any parched girl envious.
She has gone to the Winter Sports at
Chamounix—the village of the vale at the
foot of Mont Blanc.
Mrs. Hodges, widow of the late C. H.
Ilodges, formerly one of the masters of
Rugby, and later headmaster of the C. or
E. Grammar School at North Sydney, be-
longs to a family that traces itself back to
a Master of the Exchequer in the time of
Henry 11. Their home, full of historic
treasures, was that Chequers which was
lately given by Sir Alfred Lee to Llovd
George for his use and that of all succeed-
ing Prime Ministers of England. Mrs.
Hodges—a cousin, by the way, of Sir Charles
liawtrey, the actor-manager—has been liv-
ing of late at Orange, and a great farewell
was given to the cultured lady there a few
days ago.
The Wakelin show at Horderns’ Gallery
is frankly disappointing to the ordinary per-
son who likes a canvas to convey a bit of
the green earth or the golden beach as it
suited the Creator to make them. Indefinite-
ness does not always mean poetic vision, nor
is color extravagance always color rhapsody.
The best thing here is the self-portrait of
the artist, which is quite surprisingly good.
The show drew one unusual visitor—Baiero,
a Solomon Island chief on the staff of Cap-
tain Kane, who administers .that corner of
the earth. What the chief thought of the
show he did not say, but he examined each
picture under the guidance of Mr. Friend.
This is late Premier John Storey’s little
daughter Bessie, who is one of the pleas-
ing features of the chorus and Pallet
that accompany Sin-
bad in his adventures
at the Criterion.
Long, long ago—
when she was quite
10 years old —Bessie
decided to find her
career on the stage.
Lessons in her early
youth (she has now
reached mature 16)
from Harry Leston
and Nellie Stewart
made Bessie sigh to
express herself in
drama. But the
drama proper being
almost a lost art in
Sydney, musical
comedy is the next-
best thing; so ballet-
expert Minnie Hooper and a singing teacher
are finishing off the slim youngster, who looks
towards London and Madge Titheradge and
i i' Thorndike parts. Meantime she
shakes her curls and puts snap into the
chorus of “Nobody’s Baby.” “The Passing
Show ’ and “Bing Boys on Broadway” were
former shows gladdened by Bessie.
Three of our cleverest and best-looking
girl-artists, Olive Crane, Viola Macmillan
Brown (her dad’s a Professor in Chch.,
M.L.) and Vera Nicoll (she has been doing
commercial art with Smith and Julius) are
off gipsying through Europe. How their
young, keen Australian eyes will appraise
some of the moderns should prove interesting
to Master Julian Ashton.
This (Thursday) afternoon at 3.30 by the
dock, a drawingroom of the Australia will
•be‘filled by the friends of songstress Rosa
Alba, who will form a committee to arrange
a farewell concert of suitable dimensions.
JLhe pretty contralto has sung with the State
Orchestra and every known musical society
in Sydney since her first appearance five years
ago. Victorian, Queensland and Macriland
audiences have also applauded her lark-like
trills, so now it’s right-about turn to London.
In Svdney the other day was Alfred
Chandler, of Westralia, veteran verse-maker
and editor. Although he looks about 50 and
talks like an enthusiast of 80, it is 44 years
since Chandler was reporting for Adelaide
Register, and 33 have moved by since he
and the mercurial Harry Evans founded
Quiz. Also, there is a span of 30 years be-
tween his first book, “A Bush Idyll and Other
Poems,” and his last. Nowadays he edits
Perth Sunday Times. e
Say "How d’ y’ do?” to James Arcus, the
popular conductor of the Mosinan Musical
Society, which under his baton has risen to
some of its greatest heights. Mr. Jrcus
started his mut-ieM
career at 16, wh_n
i he joined the Naval
Brigade Band fired
with the desire to
plhy the French
horn, rle remained
a member of the
band for 22 years;
he linked up wLh
the Philharmonic
Society also in its
early days, and one
of his proudest memo-
ries is of playing
the cornet when
Max Vogrich lea the
society in ISSS in
“Paradise and the
Peri.” For the past
26 years he has con-
ducied De Groen’s band at the A.J.C. meet
ings at Kandwick. The picture of him is by
May Moore.
The Australian woman can do most things
she sets her mind to. The other day, at
Grafton, Miss B. McLennan appeared before
the Land Board in support of an application
by a client, and was welcomed as the
first lady land-agent to appear before a Land
Board in N. S. Wales. Still, though the
lady land-agent hasn’t made an earlier
appearance, the lady has; and she has always
cut some ice, for the land law has kept in-
sisting that where the wife is there is the
husband’s home. It isn’t always so, of
course; but the onus is thrown upon the
gentleman of proving that things are different
in his case.
Australian writer Miss Cox-Taylor, who
went off to America and Europe three years
ago to collect color for stories, has got her
carpet-bag packed with it; so she has booked
for the return journey. She will be in Syd-
ney about April,
There is a touch of romance about a war
scholarship granted by Osborne College. The
principal, Miss Gibbins, had a brother who
won the M.C., was captain in charge of
B. Co., 54th Battalion, and was killed in
the early fighting in France, and the scholar-
ship, to be held by the daughter of a dead
soldier, was offered as a memorial. One of
the names submitted was that of the young
daughter of Sergeant Crockett; and Miss
Gibbins had no difficulty in making the
award. Crockett was her brother’s own
most esteemed n.c.0., and d'ied at almost the
same time. So little Zena Crockett has the
prospect of an education which will take her
through to Sydney University.
Norman Lockhart became permanent
Registrar in Bankruptcy last week, vice
E. 11. Salusbury, who had held the job for
about a quarter of a century. The new
official, who is one of , the Lockharts of Lee,
was in England on behalf of the Crown Law
Office when the war began. He joined up
with an Imperial division and later did good
work as a staff-officer.
Captain Thompson, of the Malwa, takes
the bridge for the last time when the big
P. and O. ship leaves Sydney on her next
trip. He came off the Indian run to join the
old Arcadia as chief officer —he was her
skipper later on—and in the years between
he became known to many thousands of Aus-
tralians. He was torpedoed during the war,
but resumed duty and collected the usual
0.8. E. He will be particularly missed in
Sydney, where he has been, housed both by
the Union and Australian Clubs.
Happen to know “G. A. Claye, an Austra-
lian millionaire”? Of Sydney, it seems.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle,
Mrs. Claye arrived there by the Ventura
en route to Minden (Nev.), “the place Nary
Pickford put on the map as a quiet divorce
community”:—
His home is in Sydney, and when we went there
to live I realised that I should have married an
American. I simply could not get used to drinking
tea, and the coffee in Australia is terrible. So I
decided to set myself free.
And what comment do you think is made by
the cynical American who sends the
Chronicle story—with a leaderette based
on it, no less? Just this: “Some fools are-
journalists.”
The Speejacks Gowens were entertained
by the Royal Yacht Squadron one sunny
afternoon last week; and many of the guests
came to the tea-drinking in their own water
ciaft. ’\ ice-commodore Saxton proffered the

Prince Alfred Hospital. Mrs. Gore-Jones
smely the 1 A. s most untiring worker was
on duty, representing the Hospital Auxiliary
b i ack tulle and Jet; and Mrs.
Vincent McCauley was treasurer in gold
lace and black satin drapery. Mrs Hoi
man gave support in a heavy weight of black
jet; and Mrs. Jack Cannot supplied the quaint
carnival caps which she had made herself
and which she sold dizzily.
The Mater Misericordise Hospital, of which
genial Dr. Dan Kelly is senior surgeon, is
going to run a four days’ fete in its own gar-
dens, starting on the 22nd of next month
The hospital is one of the big R.C. institu-
tions, and the North Side faithfully braved
the dustiest tram-ride in the world one dav
last week-to discuss arrangements.
Dennis Barton, who motored down from
Coolaffand afterwards was in the Bong
Bong- flutters, returned to his station to find
partner Warden disconsolate and the
machinery shed, etc., burned to a cinder,
-the blaze started when Dennis was within
an hour of home ; and when he arrived there
was scarcely an undamaged bit of gear left
on the place.
From a Sydney penwoman in London:—
rhezes a delicate flower-like beauty about one
type of Australian girl which is hard to match
among English society women. So many of the
latter have the hard-weather complexions which ever.
Bond-street shops can’t fine down. The contrast
ccmes to my mind when I see a Sydney face like
that of Mrs. Cleaver, formerly Thelma Reid, and
daughter of the late George, in a London crush.
Thelma Cleaver is either prettier than she was in
the daj's of her flapperdom, or she appears so by con-
trast with the heavier-weight British belle. I saw
the former Sydney girl at a very recent smart
London “at home,” and in golden brown, with a
small toque poised on her golden hair, she was
most attractive. The greatly written up Lady Diana
Cooper—also amongst those present—wasn't even
next to Mrs. Cleaver.
In very pre-war days the Sydney Hunt Club
went hard over top rails let those who would look
foi a gap in a fence. Of the women with a seat
in the saddle that made the road-takers envious,
none was more conspicious than handsome Mrs.
Costin, a typical Australian bushwoman. The lady
is now Mrs. Hobson, has a home in Wales, and
generally makes a car carry her. But by way of
keeping her hand in, she has a mare called Brolga
vho can show old Wales how to dance across
country. I just missed seeing Mrs. Hobson when
she was in London for some Christmas shopping. Buf
she followed me up with a copy of bushland rhymes,
Dreams of Outback.” It’s full of Australian atmo-
sphere, and is illustrated by Laurie Tayler.
On an afternoon of murky grey I went to say
good-bye to Mrs. Griffiths, who has been a foster-
mother to quite a lot of lone Australians on this side.
hen the Ormonde left London on Christmas Eve, the
lady who is mother of the once-famous Griffiths trio
was on board, hound for Fremantle. Thence to Perth
to see daughter Muriel (Mrs. Fitch), the violinist of
the trio. From W.A. she goes on to Sydney to give
daughter Beatrice (Mrs. Walter Swinson) a hug.
Meanwhile, the hospitable home in London will be let,
and ’cellist Bessie goes to Paris.
A Brisbane postscript:—
•Anne Molyneux Thesiger, whose papa, Lord
Chelmsford, was Governor of Queensland and later
I iceroy sof India, was married, as you know, on
December 13, to Donough O’Brien, son of Lord
Inchiquin. What hasn’t been mentioned before is
that the Earl of Mulgrave, the son of another of
Queensland’s old Governors, Lord Normanby, was
train-hearer. The titled youngster is a good nine.
Last Friday night Mr. and Mrs. Bill Dearden
entertained a number of guests at the opening of
their beautiful little private theatre. Miss Irma
Dearden arranged a programme, and the proceeds
went to the Barnado Homes. Lighting, scenery,
etc., are exquisite. Charlie Dearden, who is W’ith
the Allan Wilkie co., designed it all.
Jack Fihelly, who is to succeed J. M. Hunter as
Agent-General, has many political enemies, but per-
sonally he is genuinely popular and has a vast
capacity for making friends. He is a generous
opponent, and few politicians have a larger vein of
gratitude. Mrs. Fihelly will make a decorative
Agent-Generaless. J. M. Hunter, whom Fihelly
succeeds, is a very sick man. His breakdown seems
to have been tragic.
A daughter of James Francis Garrick has be-
queathed £lO,OOO to our Uni. Her father was a
Sydney man who came North and followed the
Law and politics. In Brisbane he was a partner of
Charles Lilley, and he afterwards held portfolios
in the Douglas and Griffith Ministries. He was
twice Agent-General. The lady’s mother was a Miss
Cadell.
The trustees of the Gallery have bought an impres-
sion of a group of gums by C. H. Lancaster, one of
the leading water-colorists of the State. The lady
studied at the Melbourne Gallery, hut has lived in
Brisbane for eight years.


When the world was young and civilisation was in the learn-
l ing-to-walk stage of its development, primitive man realised
[ a need for something which would enable him to finish the
task arrested by darkness ; and of that need artificial illumi-
nation was born. Every step forward in the progress of culture
has been marked by an advance in illumination.
The r way to our civilisation of to-day lies parallel to the 'way to
better light .
A stick from the fire was no doubt the first lighting unit, but
there is plenty of evidence that crude forms of oil lamps came
into use long before history was begun. These have been dis-
carded one by one until to-day the final step
in the evolution of light is the incandescent,
electric lamp. TheG-E EDISON Electric
Lamp with its drawn tungsten wire filament
and brilliant responsive light is the electric
lamp developed to perfection.

We’d want that statement on oath before we accepted
it. We’ve never seen floods soaring, even if they
were loosed by a whole paddock, let alone a mere
path.... Rex: The parody is worse than the rubbish
it parodies. .. . V.11.G.: They don’t get anywhere near.
J.W.D.: Very poor yarn, poorly told C.G.D.:
The sonnet is wrong in form and thin in matter; the
others all limp... .M.K.M.: Doesn’t hit us quite hard
enough... .Rebus: Yarn worth a small par; verse
worth feeding to cattle Bruce L.: One held for
inquest; the others too lumpy. .. .Ilray: Doesn’t make
a story... .R.F.G.: “The, Killing” has been done too
often.... Edwin W.: An old yarn with the phono-
graph in place of the camera. .. .Oliver B.: “Life
and its Ways” is printed as a solemn warning that
in the midst of life we may fall among traps:—
They came along as pals would come,
Lobbed in the boarding-house as strangers ;
They didn’t look as though they came to hum.
Of course no one scented danger.
Ah, none of the boys smelt a rat,
Playing cards and this and that;
Even played for beer, went around with the hat,
Little did they dream of an attack.
Then the day of reckoning came,
Couldn’t believe it, they were trapped;
These pals which played the game—
The game was up, well mapped.
Of course they were up before the beak,
To answer how or where they got their beer ;
They got it for these pals, gentlemen, humble and
meek —■
Never thought to have any cause to fear.
R.N.S.: None of them suit... .Erner: Glad you
think it’s “creditable verse”; but it’s dreadful to
think that you can imagine anything, worse... .
G.J.R.: Misses. . .Hispaniola: Very crude. . .V. 8.: (E.
Malvern) : “The Passing” doesn’t strike us. . .L.C.R.:
Your “Oil” and our ink won’t mix. .. .E.J.McK.:
Doesn’t even try to say anything Verri: It hasn’t
quite got the feeling. Also a four-line stanza under
normal circumstances requires two pairs of rhymes.
A.S. (Balmain): Four rhymes to the octave of a
sonnet is not playing the game A.T.W.: Poor and
commonplace H.F. (S.A.) : Not up Gwen. N.:
“Love lit their souls with pie” is a memorable line.
... .Willigobring: The bees are pretty ordinary in-
sects and reckless in their treatment of the English
language. .. .A.C.8.: The only fee charged for becom-
ing a famous novelist is the price of ink and paper;
but we fear your “authoristics” would hardly be in
our line... .F.H.S.A.: yerge whose lines are any old
length, rhyme occasionally and say nothing much fills
us with sorrow Carmen M.: Terrible. ... R.N.S.:
Don’t wonder that your young affections are blighted
if you assault the girl with versa like that. .. .1.L.1. :
“Johann” is only good in small spots; the story
itself is old and mechanical E.T.L.: Horrible yarn
rejected with enthusiasm... .Simple Simon: Very thin
at the beginning, middle and and.... John-oh: Too
crude.... D’R.C.: None of them up, but “Hell” gets
near... .A.A.L.: Blank verse must be a lot better
than that... .E.H. (South Yarra) : Ideas too small.

Sinjcoorg: When the subject is Saul and Jonathan and
you write in rhymeless alcaics, the freshness and
novelty of it take our breath away... .Pakeha: The
point is blunted with much use. But the work is
fair.... Rae I.: Not far enough away from the
nursery-rhyme class. .. .Warradulla: But it all seems
so obvious... .Cecil M.: “Elections” —the froth with-
out the beer... .A.G.J.: Got up to the edge; and

The “Home-made” Craze.
M"T" OTiK finished? That’s splendid.
j j Well, I’m afraid you ladies will
have to be idle for a little until
a fresh lot of files are ready: this comes.of
‘hustling’!”
And the door closed behind the back of
the head of Department X. The four occu-
pants of the room settled themselves a trifle
more easily in their chairs. One, a slim,
red-haired girl, whipped a piece of lemon-
colored knitting from a drawer and bent dili-
gently to her needles.
“That going to be a jumper, Miss May-
field?” inquired a dark girl whose hair
tumbled untidily about her ears. Then, as
the other nodded, “you are clever: there's
a regular craze for home-made things, but
I’m such an awful slacker. Oh, bother
my hair!” she broke off, vainly trying to
thrust back an unruly lock, “I washed it
last night, and I can't do a thing with it
to-day.”
“What do you wash it with?” inquired
Miss Mayfield. “Not Stallax, I’m sure.
Ah, I thought not.”
“I do,” said a pretty fair girl who had
not yet spoken. “It’s simply splendid
stuff.”
“There,” said Miss Mayfield, “I told yoi
so. You try it next time. If you haven’t
any at home a chemist will always supply
it. It works up into the most lovely foamy
lather and cleans your hair in no time.
Afterwards it dries quickly and crisply, so
that it can be done up at once—none of
that untidy ‘endy’ look the day after a
shampoo.”
“Well, well,” said the dark-haired one,
“that’s something . worth trying. As we’re
on the subject, do any of you know a cure
for falling hair? I’m convinced I’m getting
prematurely bald; also I’ve got quite a
little patch of grey hair —overwork, of
course,” she grinned.
The head of the room, a slightly older
woman whose face was redeemed from plain-
ness by the masses of soft brown hair sur-
rounding it, sailed into the discussion.
“I don't think you’ll beat my recipe, Miss
Carey,” she said; “and, like Miss May-
field’s jumper, it’s home made. Get a pack-
age of boranium from your chemist, and
dissolve it in bay rum. If you rub this
into the roots of your hair at night you will
find, in a few days, that not only will your
hair stop falling out, but it will grow much
more thick and glossy. If you aren’t joking
about that grey hair I can give you a tip
which has been of great use to me person-
ally.”
“I’d be fearfully grateful, Mrs. Drewe,”
answered Miss Carey.
“Well,” said the other, “it is not unlike
the first recipe, only this time the bay rum
should have pure tammalite dissolved in it.
You should apply the mixture with a clean,
small brush, and it will gradually restore
the faded part to its normal color. Of
course, this isn’t a dye; I know nothing
about hair-dyes, for I disapprove of' them
entirely. But it’s a wonderful tonic.”
“Thanks so much,” Miss Carey said; “I
ought to be a dream of beauty as regards
my hair. Seriously, though, I’m going to
try your ideas. Stallax, boranium, tamma-
lite—is that right? Thanks, Miss May-
field, what a delicious jumper that is;
but my complexion would never stand that
color. You red-haired girls are lucky, you
always have such topping skins.”
“I had anything but a topping skin a
year ago,” replied the latter. I used to
freckle and burn and get dreadfully blotched-
looking. Then a friend told me that mer-
colised wax was by far the most scientific
and effective thing she knew. If it is rubbed
on at night and washed off with warm water
in the morning it gradually absorbs the outer
skin which has become stained and rough-
ened, and reveals the fresh new skin under-
neath. It sounded rather wonderful, and
so I tried it; and I’ve used no other face-
cream since.”
“Would you believe it?” murmured the
facetious Miss Carey. “I wouldn’t be half
so bad-looking if I had your skin, Miss May-
field. Is this wax very difficult to get?”
“Not a bit,” said the other; “any decent
chemist has some in stock.”
Mrs. Drewe looked up. “You all seem
great beauty-specialists! I wonder if one of
you experts know if there is any way of
curing blackheads, as I have a friend who is
quite disfigured with them?”
Miss Carey knitted her brows, but the
fair girl said quickly: “I think most people
use something called stymol, which you can
buy in tablet form. It closes the pores of
the skin, or, rather, reduces them to their
proper size, and that loosens any blackheads
and prevents others from forming.”
“How do you use it?” inquired Mrs. Drewe.
“For blackheads, I believe you dissolve a
tablet in warm water, bathe them and gently
remove them with a towel. But, though I
don’t personally suffer from I
often have a stymol face-bath. It’s so de-
liciously sparkling and refreshing.”
“Thank you so much; I am sure my friend
will be very grateful,” smiled Mrs. Drewe.
A step sounded in the corridor. "I m
afraid this very enlightening discussion must
be postponed,” she continued. “I think that’s
the messenger with our files. Yes, here
they come. We must carry on with the
work now.” —Advt.

The Rose-Apple.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What is it to you if l have fled.
To the four winds’ embraces,
Eaten fruit of eglantine,
Slept in strange places t”
—Old Gypsy Song.
GOSSAMER, dew, and an autumn sun-
rise,
Sharp, sweet scent of the rubied
brier,
A golden girl and a dark young fellow
At the slip-rails down in the orchard yellow
Where the slender trees are all afire.
“Dear heart,” he whispers, "life is long
For the thousand paths of flowers and song.
Let us seek adventure together. No?
Then rest you here, my delicate maiden !”
And this was seventy years ago.
(Oh, the innocent-fateful rose-apple,
Fruit of the wilding eglantine!
Fruit unhappy that drives, once tasted,
Out from Eden through long years wasted,
Through little by-paths that roam and
twine,
Leading no-whither but on and on
Till morn is eve and the sunshine gone—
Pity poor Youth in its arrogance blind!
Pity—or envy—such careless kingship?
Pie seeks, and surely the seekers find!)
The boy, half-turned for his scornful going,
Lingers yet as the low beams shine
From fairy ringlets, disposed so primly,
To little foot tapping, ail sandalled trimly,
Under the monstrous crinoline,
On the muslin patterned with butterfly-wings,
And the bonnet swung by its lavender strings,
On a maid demure as a dainty dream :
“Yes, stay you home, most elegant lady—
Sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam!”
She with a clear, low laugh looks upward,
A sudden glint in her lovely eyes;
And surely the red of the gipsy berry
Has stained those gay lips, wicked and merry!
“I plan my venturing otherwise,
Dear heart,” she mimics, “for life is wide,
And the thousand paths of love divide.
Farewell, good speed to the quest —
heigho!”
“Then a kiss for luck, mv girl, and another.”
So they parted seventy years ago.
He ran to the world and its wide-armed
welcome;
His youth like a precious wine he spilled
On the altar-steps of Pleasure and Danger,
Following ever the farther and stranger,
Till drop by drop his warm joy chilled
Under the cunning, slow poison of age.
When he read one night on the last dim page
Of his long life-volume, broken and old,
He turned from it wearily, straightway
dreaming
Back through the years to the morning
gold.
How had she fared in her lawless wandering,
Plis light, light love of the care-free days?
The path of roses she trod well witting,
And best forgot is her brief bright flitting
That fair as a falling meteor strays
Past one old reveller’s darkening eves.
“No love is frail as the first,” he sighs,
“Nor sweet!” as the life leaves his.quiet
breast.. ..
But those who have sipped of the gypsy
juices
Can even the grave constrain to rest?
Gossamer, dew, and the haunted moonshine,
Naked thorns on the hoary brier;
Under the dead trees, lichen-shrouded,
Two lovers drifting, dimly clouded,
Where the slip-rails rot like a waiting pyre
Meet, touch hands, and smile to see
A last red rose-apple swinging free,
A scarlet bead on the prickly bough.
“One kiss for luck, my silvery sweetheart!”
Is it seventy years ago—or now?

A Glass of Sherry
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
u OME into the library,” said Stohr
1 i in a subdued voice.
He helped Gleeson rid himself of
his overcoat and muffler and pushed open
the door, disclosing a medium-sized room
walled on two sides by glass-cased rows of
books. Under foot was a pile carpet. The
window-blinds were drawn closely and a
coal fire burned in the grate. On the table
was a brass oil-lamp with a red shade. A
few leather-covered chairs and a small writ-
ing-desk, on which was a tray holding a
decanter and two glasses, completed the fur-
nishings.
“You continue to stick to the lamp, I
see.” said Gleeson, seating himself. His
full-fleshed face, with wide mouth and heav-
ily-pouched eyes, expressed open boredom
as he glanced from side to side. “A bit
old-fashioned, don’t you think?”
“It suits me,” said Stohr. He closed the
door carefully and turned to his visitor, a
trace of furtiveness in his manner. “The
electric light hurts my eyes. I thought you
knew that. Well—so you got my note?”
“You see me here,” returned Gleeson
curtly. “To be frank, I thought twice be-
fore deciding to come. However” —he
shrugged his shoulders indifferently—“l
trust I’m not unreasonable. If you really
have something of importance to say, I’m
willing enough to listen. Please be as brief
as possible. I have an appointment at 8
o’clock.”
“There is a. chance you may keep it,”
said Stohr. His rather prominent eyes took
stock of the other man curiously. “It is
hard to believe that we were once friends.
I confess the thought amuses me. And you,
no doubt.”
“I never hated you so cordially as at
this moment,” broke in Gleeson, with a
tremulous thrusting of his underlip.
•j. smiled grimly. “I can well believe
it. I he proposal I am about to make will
then, no doubt, meet with your approval.
Ut course, you have already guessed that it
concerns Barbara.”
She. knows that I am here?” asked Glee-
son stirring a little at the name.
ohe does not. At my suggestion sj}.e,
ana my sister went on a shopping excursion
immediately after lunch. They arranged
to dine out, and I do not expect them home
for some time yet. At the present moment
we have the house to ourselves.”
“I should be wiser,” said Gleeson, with a
faint sneer, “if I knew where all this was
leading.”
Stohr’s thin face flushed slightly. “In a
moment. You and I, Gleeson, have known
each other for nearly 40 years. Until three
years ago—to be exact, until Barbara Sea-
ton became my ward-at-law and came to
live here under the protection of my sister
—we were friends. To outward appearance
we remain so, although it must be apparent
even to Barbara, for whose sake we agreed
to sink our difference in public, that the old-
time cordiality is lacking. For myself, I
have no regrets for the past. Nor, I take
it, have you.”
“I have seldom listened to such an accu-
rate expression of my own views,” said
Gleeson with labored insolence. “For the
Devil’s sake, Stohr, say what you want and
be done with it. Your maundering doesn’t
improve with the years.”
“I’ll fetch my point in my own way,”
said Stohr sharply. “But since you want
plain speaking you shall have it. We are
both in love with Barbara. Each believes—■
though God knows with what justification—
that were the other out of the way she
would welcome a declaration. If I am many
years her senior, so also are you. Still, dis-
parity in age is no bar to a happy and con-
tented union. That I was her father’s clos-
est friend, and, therefore, the most suitable
to act as her guardian until she attains her
majority, scarcely enters into the question
at issue. I am convinced that Barbara re-
gards us at the present moment with an
equal affection, and would shrink from the
thought of having to choose between us.”
He paused a second, sucking in his breath
nervously. “I intend to relieve her of such
an unpleasant responsibility.”
“Very thoughtful of you, I’m sure,” said
Gleeson. He consulted his watch with a
yawn. “May I ask how you propose to do
it?”
“It is quite simple,” said Stohr slowly. He
placed the decanter of wine on the table be-
■tiween them. “So simple, in fact, that my
only wonder is the thought has occurred to
neither of us before. I don’t know exactly
how it appears to you, Gleeson, but to my
mind a hatred such as ours can have but
one possible ending. I put it to you that
there is not room enough in this world for
us both.”
“Nor in the next,” muttered Gleeson.
“I can reassure you there, I think,” said
Stohr, with a twisted smile. “It is improb-
able we shall meet. To return —either
you or I must go out of Barbara’s life,
finally and irrevocably. And since there is
not the slightest chance that either will
yield voluntarily (you understand the sense
in which I use the word) there remains
only—this.”
While Gleeson stared uncomprehendingly
Stohr lifted the decanter and poured an
exactly even quantity of wine into each
glass.
“If the method savors of the mediaeval it
has at least the advantage of being thorough.
This is sherry, by the way. By coincidence
—sinister enough, if you like, but still coin-
cidence —it chances to be Barbara’s favorite
wine. Are you satisfied there is an equal
division?”
“What are you at?” asked Gleeson
sharply. Some quality in Stohr’s tone
struck him as peculiar, and for the J first-
time he appeared uneasy. “What mum-
mery is this?”
For answer Stohr took from his waistcoat
pocket two tiny pilules of similar size and
color.
“I present you with a certain solution.
Each of these is a shell of starch. It is im-
possible to distinguish between them.- Yet
one contains water only, while the other
is filled with a vegetable poison which is,
as I was at some pains to learn, one of the
most subtle and deadly _ poisons known to
medical science. It is easily dissolved, in
wine for preference. Ah, so you take my
meaning at last!”
“You’re mad,” exclaimed Gleeson, his jaw
fallen.
“On the contrary, I was never more sane,”
said Stohr. He paused a moment. “Come,
I do you this much justice at least. I have
never classed you as coward, even in the
supremest moments of my hate. Why hesi-
tate? I know that your affairs are in order.
Or is it the dock you fear, in a belief that
the devil will fend for his own ? Bah ! Am
I then such an utter fool? Do you suppose
I have any more desire than yourself to
spend my wedding night in chains? I tell
you this stuff defies analysis. According to
McArdle, who is admittedly the first student
of toxicology in the Commonwealth, science
is powerless to detect its presence in the
human system. It is odorless and tasteless,
it kills painlessly and almost instan-
taneously. Oh. I assure you, a paragon
among poisons!”
“What has Dr. McArdle to do with this —
this damned absurdity?” demanded Gleeson,
with twitching brows. “Why, good God,
Stohr, you grow more impossible every day.
Take a pull, man, before you go too far.”
Stohr winced angrily. “And you? What
must I d« to convince you that I am in
deadly earnest? Is it McArdle you baulk at?
He was simply the means to an end. From
him I obtained the information I sought.
Otherwise he knows nothing—can know
nothing, even though he may ultimately sus-
pect. If you need further assurance you
have it in the fact that the poor devil of a
chemist who compounded those pills died
three days ago.” He tapped the cloth im-
patiently. “I’m waiting for you to choose.”
“Then you’ll need more patience than I
give you credit for,” snapped Gleeson. He
laughed thickly and got to his feet. “Stohr,
you’re not far short of raving. Be damned
to you and your cheap melodrama! I’ve
wasted my time, after all.”
“You refuse the hazard?” said Stohr, in
a flat voice.
“I’m going home, if that’s what you mean.
I’ll see you in Hell first.”
“Then will this help you change your
mind.” said Stohr. Without warning he
strimk the other man full on the pouting lips.
“That! —for a craven hound!” he said
jerkily.

Those agonising twinges across the small of the back,
that dull, throbbing ache, may be your warning of
serious kidney weakness —serious if neglected, for it
might easily lead to gravel, stone, bladder inflammation,
dropsy, or fatal kidney disease. So if you are suffering
with a bad back, look for other proof of kidney trouble,
and if there are dizzy spells, headaches, nervous despon-
dent attacks; a dull, tired condition and disordered
kidney action, get after the cause. Take things easier
for a while and use DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY
PILLS, the remedy that has been tested for you by
thousands. What satisfied users say is the best proof
of Doan’s reliability.
STRAIGHTFORWARD STATEMENTS BY SYDNEY PEOPLE.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Jas. Wilson, 17 Little Buckingham Street, Sydney, says: “For a long
time I suffered torture from backache and kidney trouble. The pains in my
back were very severe and I have been so bad that I could not attend to my
work, as every movement caused positive torture. The kidney secretions were
affected, being thick and cloudy and containing a red sediment. I was also
subject to dizzy feelings and could not sleep properly at night. Nothing I took
gave me any permanent relief, but one day when I was feeling very bad I
heard good reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so I sent for some, and
after taking seven bottles I was cured. This remedy not only banished the
backache, but strengthened and toned up my kidneys and improved my general
health.”
Mr. Wilson confirms the above eight years later and says: “I am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills and always have a bottle
in the house. By taking them every now and again my kidneys keep in a healthy
state, and I am never troubled with backache.”
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. E. Wilkinson, 29 Campbell Street, St. Peters, Sydney, says: “For
some time I suffered agony from lumbago-like pains across the small of my
back. These pains prevented me from bending or getting proper rest at night,
and seriously hampered me when attending to my household duties. Sometimes
I was so bad that I could hardly move, and if I tried to get about the house
the pain was almost unbearable. After trying all sorts of remedies without
success, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under my notice, so I got
some, and they did me good almost at once. After taking two bottles of these
pills I was ever so much better, and eight bottles completely cured me. J-hat
was twelve months ago, and I have been -well ever since. I always have &
bottle of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in house and take a dose
occasionally, and they keep me in splendid health.”
Ten years later Mrs. Wilkinson says: “I have been free from backache
since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me eleven years ago.”

. Gleeson’s face, went livid. The breath
caught snarling in his throat as he
a chair to steady himself. "I call your
bluff, Stohr. You’ll go through with the
business now, whether you meant it or not.”
“Good !” said Stohr, once more impassive.
“I thought that would fetch you. Make your
choice.”
Without a word Gleeson snatched a pellet
and dropped it in the wine at his elbow.
Stohr followed suit.
"We drink together, if you please. ‘To
Barbara’s happiness’—a last toast, Gleeson,
and no heel-taps.”
“Before God, this is murder!” said Glee-
son, with stiff lips.
“Before God, if He know a surer way to
damnation let Him point it!” began Stohr,
a little wildly. But he ceased abruptly and
lowered the glass untasted. His eyes be-
came suddenly alert. “Wait—someone is
coming.”
As he spoke the door opened and a girl
entered, letting a rush of cold air into the
room. F
“Barbara !” exclaimed Gleeson.
She stood looking at them with a smile,
her cheeks ruddy with health, her eyes
sparkling in the mellow lamplight.
“Bob! You here—with Peter? How
lucky to find you together like this! You
know we seem somehow to have "got away
from the jolly evenings together that we
used to have. It’s worried me more than I
can tell you. I thought all sorts of foolish
things.” Her laugh rang out sweetly. “This
is quite like old times. And I’m so happy
—so happy to-night.”
Stohr smiled constrainedly. “Are you?
That’s fine. But why to-night especially?
Have you and Molly been to a bargain sale?”
She came closer, her eyes seeming to melt
with a strange tenderness.
“Ah, don’t tease, Peter. It’s all so won-
derful that I don’t seem to find words to
tell you. Why, how serious you both look!
Have you been worrying about your old
business?” She touched Gleeson’s glass
lightly. “And you’re drinking sherry —my
sherry. Greedy things. I’ve a good mind to
punish you.”
“Barbara !.... God !” Stohr’s voice rose
in a sudden scream. He threw himself
across the table at her, but too late. His
writhing fingers touched only an empty glass
and sent it smashing to the floor. He fell
back into his chair, his face suddenly ashen.
The girl looked at him in hurt bewilder-
ment; “Peter, how rude of you ! Whatever
is the matter? Bob won’t mind in the least
because I drank his wine. I only did it to
tease you.” Her lips straightened defiantly.
“I think you’re horrid. And see what a mess
you’ve made on Molly’s cloth. You’ve spilt
every drop of your own wine.”
Gleeson’s lips moved, but no sound escaped
him. He remained rigidly on his seat, as if
frozen by the immensity of his horror. Only
his eyes, searching the beautiful face with
a kind of desperate eagerness, revealed the
agony of doubt that made of his mind a hell.
Stohr lifted his head. “It’s all right,
Babs. I’m sorry. I—it was only a clumsy
joke. Never mind the mess. I’ll make it
right with Molly. You were saying”
“I don’t understand,” said the girl slowly.
But suddenly her frown vanished and she
smiled again radiantly, transformingly.
"How can Ibe cross to-night! Oh, i'eier,
if you only knew how my heart is singing.
And you’re to be the first —almost the very
first, you and Bob —to know. We’ve been
such friends always—we three. You’ve been
like dear big brothers to me. I know you’ll
understand and be so glad—for my sake.
Are you listening? Bob! Peter! I’m
going to be married!”
Gleeson was the first to break silence.
He was smiling mechanically.
“Barbara! Why, of course, you know, if
it’s true”
She appeared unconscious of anything but
the supreme beauty of the thought. "Yes,
it’s true. I knew you’d be so glad. Isn’t
it wonderful? I’ve always wanted his love.
And to-night he told me. He’s so strong
and clever. He’s so much a man. I can
scarcely realise it even now.” She put her
hand to her throat. “How close the room
is! Peter, kind old Peter, why don’t you
say someunug> iuu uuven c even asued
his name. And yet you know him so well,
and like him.”
“Who, Babs?” asked Stohr, in a sort of
sick whisper.
“Jim McArdle,” said the girl.
She looked at them a moment with dilat-
ing eyes, put her hands out blindly, and
fell gently forward over the table.
“You devil! Oh, you damned devil!” cried
Gleeson chokingly.
His chair crashed to the floor as he ran
insanely for the telephone in the hall.
BERNARD CRONIN.
Charlie Puts a Collar On.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CHARLIE was whistling. Therefore he
was happy. There was nothing in that,
though. For the Pearl Queen lay still
as a mouse in the quiet waterway, with
nothing to remind us of the sickening
months of roll, roll, roll she had just given
us. All around lay the mosquito craft of
the fishing fleet, all breeds of craft, from the
gull-like, slippery schooner to the tiny five-
ton cutter. And all breeds of men owned
them: white men, Jap men, colored men.
And fr'owning above us Thursday Island,
with its little town, its garrison, its reser-
voir, and its mixture of all the peoples of
the earth.
Busy dinghies, echoing from the laughter
of the blackboy rowers, plied swiftly to the
jetties, loaded with bags full of the dried sea-
slug, and bags full of the opalescent glories
of the pearl shell.
And the warm sun shone kindly. And
Charlie kept on whistling. I put it down to
the fat cheque we had drawn. We had had
a good season. And b£che-de-mer was “up.”
But as the shades of late afternoon closed
over the somewhat naughty little island, I
missed Charlie’s whistling and slipped
below. Charlie was in the cabin. I crawled
sideways into my tiny bunk. I had to. \\ hen
a man is trying to fit on a high collar within
the tiny limits of a lugger s cabin there is
no space for a mouse to move, let alone
another man.
Charlie was not used to high collars, and
our looking-glass has a wavering crack right
across it, with several young ones running
sideways from it. A heavy sea was respon-
sible. A man has to study that glass tor
weeks before he can shave in it. In the
right-hand top corner about two square
inches of the mirror is whole. If you stand
on tiptoe, turn your head partly sideways,
you can shave all right—in patches. But
you want to be careful.
Charlie was trying to put on his collar.
He is not a very tall man, but had over-
come this difficulty by standing on two
pillows. Mine was the top pillow.
I suppose my talking silence unnerved
him a bit. He was evidently ashamed of
himself. Not of the language he was using,
but when a man who has been used to wear-
ing a soft shirt all his life is caught red-
handed juggling with a high collar hes
certain to heel embarrassed. Besides, the
starb’rd edge of the collar would jamb in
his jugular.
“For Gord’s sake,” he said at last, “don’t
talk so much. The townspeople will think
we’ve got an • overworked gramophone
aboard.”
I filled my pipe. That is a delicate opera-
tion in a bunk where a man has barely room
to breathe.
“What are you shipping the choker for?”
I asked sociably.
“Fun!” replied Charlie bitterly.
I did not answer. This may have un-
nerved him. At any rate, he tore the collar
from his neck and tossed it through the open
companionway. It hit the water with a
hearty smack.
Charlie turned his back on me. He care-
fully selected another collar from a brown-
paper parcel on his bunk. He stood on the
pillows again. I noticed he’d torn a five-
inch strip from the back of his shirt. Charlie
noticed it, too, after he had been poking his
fist through the hole in a groping way for
five frantic minutes. No wonder he
couldn’t find the back stud. It had gone
sailing out to sea with the collar. Maybe
by this time a dandy fish had swallowed it.
“Why didn’t you tell me there was a hole
in me shirt?” he growled. “Lying there like
a stuffed sea-cow with th’ faceache.”
“You didn’t ask me,” I replied.
But Charlie was really angry. He peeled
off the shirt, and seized another one from
the brown-paper parcel. In his hurry he
put it on back to front. But he didn’t
notice this —not until he tried to stuff the
tail end down where the other part ought to
go. Then he tore the shirt off. He had no
idea it would tear so easily.
Charlie seized another shirt. I began to
think he’d bought all Thursday Island. But
he was much more careful with this one. I
suppose it was the last hope.
He drew it down over his head, then his
chest, carefully. Charlie’s chest shows very
plainly what his ancestors were. I noticed
that the forest was trembling violently.
Some men are emotional.
But he got the shirt on. He stood on the
pillows again. He felt round for the back
stud. A sort of blank spread over his face.
He sprang off the pillows, and seized both
shirts on the cabin floor. But they were
innocent of a stud. He searched the floor
anxiously. Then he dropped on his knees,
and stuck his head under the bunk.
“What are you looking for?” I asked.
“Stud !” he said, in a suppressed kind of
voice. “Have you seen that back collar-stud
of mine?”
“Not unless it’s the one that was in the
collar you heaved overboard.”
Charlie sprang up suddenly. It is not
good to spring up suddenly in our cabin. He
glared down at me for a full minute, holding
his head with one hand and his breath with
the other.
“Have you got any spare studs? I forgot
to buy a supply,” lie said (juietly.
“Never use ’em,” I replied cheerfully.
Charlie made a dash for the companion-
way. From the bows I heard him yell
“Pretty Polly, ahoy!”
“Ahoy !” came faintly from the Malay skip-
per of Prettv Polly.
“Have you got a stud aboard,, Tarquay?”
yelled Charlie. “Send us aboard a collar-
stud !”
“A whata?” came faintly.
“Stud! Stud! Stud !” screamed Charlie.
“A damn”
“Aw righta,” bellowed Tarquay. “I send
him.”
Charlie paced the deck for the best part of
10 minutes. I could tell he was pressed for
time, his footfalls were getting shorter and
quicker. Finally came the blick of rowlocks
1 strolled on deck. A boy from the Pretty
Polly had just rowed alongside. He reached
down into the dinghy; then, gripping the
lugger’s rail, he handed up to the eager
Charlie an iron stud, one of those bolts we
use for clinching parted timbers.
Charlie gave a short, sharp howl, and flew
down the companion-way. I leaned against
the mast, and smoked. Old Sol had gone to
bunk, starry lights were twinkling in the
little town, many laughing voices floated
musically across the water. It was one of
those evenings when a man feels his soul is
at peace. He really doesn’t know what his
soul is, but he feels that it is at peace, any-
way. , TT , ,
Charlie came on deck at last. He had
his collar on and a tie. Also a coat and
a new hat. He did not look at me.
“Get the dinghy. Toby,” he snarled.
Toby is our head boy. The mission edu-
cated him. Toby just gazed at Charlie, or,
rather, Charlie’s collar, with his big mouth
half-open. Then his mouth widened. But
he didn’t laugh. He didn’t have time.
Charlie took' a sudden step forward. Toby
took six sudden steps backward. Then he
sprang for the stern and hauled up the
dinghy. He got in and seized the oars; his
eyes never left the collar. Charlie got in.
They pushed off for the shore.
“You’ll be late for tea,” I called casually.
Charlie didn’t answer. Perhaps his collar
was hurting him. I noticed it had a list
to his port ear.

The best you can buy are well worth the price because you

This means good priming, even loads, close patterns

Good Health is Happiness
but how can either exist with a
stomach or a torpid liver ? It may be
humiliating* but it is true* that the very
powers on which we pride ourselves most,
insight, judgment* ambition, ability to work*
are often dependent upon the condition of our
digestive organs. If these important organs do
not perform their functions satisfactorily, the
body and brain both suffer. How necessary is
it therefore, for us to live so that the stomach and
liver do their full duty and supply our bodies
with the vigor we need for our daily work.
Beecham’s Pills
were introduced over seventy years ago for the
very purpose of preventing or relieving all these
troubles arising in the stomach, liver, kidneys
and bowels. That they have been successful is
proved by their wonderful popularity in all parts
of the world. They are everywhere recognized
as the most useful and efficacious remedy.
They give speedy relief in cases of impaired
digestion, sluggish liver, bilious headaches and
constipation. They tone up the system and
keep the body in a satisfactory state of health.
