TO OSS-ON-WYE, situated on a hill over-
looking the Wye, retains much of its
old-world appearance. Its most promin-
ent building is the 12th century church
whose needle-like spire towers above the
beautiful Wye Valley. Another feature
of the town is the Marked House or
Town Hall, built of red sandstone on
raised arches in the reign of Charles II
(1660-1685), Nearby is the house once
occupied by John Kyrle, who died in
1724, known through Pope’s poem as
“The Man of Ross,” renowned for his
loyalty to the Stuarts and for his
benevolence.
Ross is an unrivalled centre for tour-
ing ; either by- road or boat the Wye
Valley possesses some of the most beauti-
ful and impressive scenery in the British
Isles. Here can be seen verdant hills
and cultivated pastures, for here, as
Masefield, the Poet Laureate, has said
of the Wye Valley, nearly every one lives
on and by the land ; it is nature unsullied
by industry. Here it is that the tired
heart can turn for renewed energy, and
the wearied brain for fresh inspiration.
The River Wye is one of the fine rivers
which has its source in Plynlimmon, the
Welsh mountain. Its course to the sea
is sinuous; and in places it doubles back
on itself; an example of this is afforded
by the remarkable Horseshoe Bend at
Ross. The banks of the river have a wide
diversity of charm; ancient castles and
abbeys, stately mansions, cliffs rising 700
feet above the bed of the river, and
picturesque rocky heights richly wooded
with wild cherry, hazel, birch and
beeches. In its course, and within easy
touring distance of Ross, the river passes
Tintern Abbey, the castles of Wilton,
Goodrich and Chepstow, Flanesford
Priory founded in 1347, and Courtfield,
a mansion associated with the boyhood
of Henry V.
Mr. H. V. Morton in his book “In
Search of England” has this to say of
the view from Ross, “I looked down at
the Bend of the river and out, over green
country that lies in calm beauty, to the
mountains of Wales, This is, I think,
one of the most magnificent panoramas
I have yet seen.”

GALLIPOLI MISSION.
For one who spent part of his boy-
hood in the surroundings and amongst
some of the scenes described, it seems
a special sort of astonishment to think,
even now, of there having been on Anzac
one like C. E. W. Bean ; one who was
engaged in something else in that place ;
to whom, there as it was happen-
ing, it was history. One who was mature
enough to be there, detached, above the
fighting, getting it all down for future
use by his own remarkable methods ;
one looking on it, moreover, against
the long vista of the setting’s own far
and classical history.
That, of course, was Bean’s mind ; not
the lanky, long-striding, thin-shanked
Bean himself, sighted from time to time
anywhere from the vicinity of the trench
round the top of Shell Green, where a
gun of the old 7th Battery jutted its
snout out over the front line, down to
where Beachy used to scatter the shrap
on the ammo and stores at the far end
towards Suvia. He would be pointed out
as the Official Correspondent, which was
a sort of a Mystery itself but nothing
to the Mystery he actually was. An
Official Correspondent was no doubt
what those who appointed him reckoned
on ; and what a bargain they got for their
money! A complete, thoroughly
equipped Historian,' with a mind like the
balance of Justice itself.
Bean’s methods, as touched on in
Gallipoli Mission —a supplement to the
History in describing Anzac lapsing back
into its age-old silence—are alone a syn-
thesis of autobiography. One of the several
purposes of the Mission (which went back
there shortly after the 1914-18 war ended)
was the filling in of gaps in Bean’s general
records of Anzac —what, for instance,
had been the farthest points reached on
that 25th of April. This was done by
examining all the indicated places for
signs of the fighting: there were still
plenty of signs about at that time; so
many and of a kind that the place got
the party down before they were through,
and gave artist George Lambert the
blues. They found that practically
without exception, wherever there had
been fighting there would be signs of it
on the ground: bits of clothing, discarded
equipment (all men in fighting discard
something), used cartridges and clips and
the like. So Bean was able to fill in his
gaps and map Anzac with exact accuracy.
But from the first day onwards he had
been making his record by his own
thorough methods. He had questioned
leaders and men on where they had got
to on that day ; asking each of them, also,
who he remembered being near him,
making his notes and then questioning
those in turn —not catching up with some
of them till years afterwards in France.
On Anzac in 1915 Bean would sit up
through the night in whatever sort of a
hole in the hills he had for a
shelter and set down his records—some
200 notebooks of them! So that there,
as it went on, was the history of it being
set down.
Gallipoli Mission is, as indicated, an
autobiographical addition, and this not
only in what Bean says of himself (never
very much) but more in what he says of
others who were with him; and, of
course, what he says of Anzac; the old
shape of the place coming into their
sight and his feeling of “homesickness”
for it, and while he is there again his
sensitive, controlled reaction to its terrific
tragedy.
Of the others on the Mission, artist
George Lambert perhaps gives the most
of Bean ; perhaps as much of Bean as
Bean gives of him. Regarding Lambert
there’s an impression of Bean th,e historian
in some conflict with a Bean not wanting
to be guilty of any hint of malice.
This may be quite wrong ; but the im-
pression does not occur regarding any
other member of the Mission—Hubert
Wilkins, for example, or their Turk
helper Zeki Bey. Anyway, if there was
such a conflict the historian won. But
with Bean the historian would win every
time; which, as can be shown in one
fantastic instance, certainly can not be
said of Lambert.
Bean’s able biographical touch makes
the Mission members living characters;
but Lambert evidently meant more to
him than any of the others, except, per-
haps, the Turk. That seems to go even
for Wilkins, which is specially re-
markable in Wilkins’s having been, above
everything, a man of action; an ad-
venturer ; one, as Bean says, who “invari-
ably sought his goal through adventure —
the more dangerous the more acceptable ;
indeed, I sometimes doubted whether any
course of action was. for long agreeable
to him unless it led eventually to danger.”
The very embodiment, surely, of the
general character, and the real activating
motive, of those fellows who stormed
Anzac.
And, going on the same evidence, that
could not be said of Lambert. At least,
not in the same sense. Yet the positive
impression of Lambert on Bean the his-
torian of the Anzacs, against the appar-
ently rather negative impression made on
him by such a character as Hubert
Wilkins, is perhaps understandable, and
even right. Lambert—red-bearded, wear-
ing spurs and his revolver on this after-
war Official-Artist visit —was by ap-
pearance, talk and character highly
flamboyant. Is it wholly right to say the
Anzacs were not ? Superficially they cer-
tainly were not. In their own language,
they were as rough as bags. They looked
and they lived there as if they had been
rough-cut out of its own gravelled ridges.
Against that, Lambert; “the golden
beard, the hat, the cloak, the spurs, the
laugh and the conviviality of a cavalier
one could not help wondering whether
he did not consciously mould himself on
the contemporaries of Van Dyck and
Velasquez, whose art so evidently in-
fluenced his own.” Well, even as to
appearance the men at Anzac had their
own wild picturesqueness, and in his acted
part as well Lambert could be seen as
dramatising what was in them, as Bean
would seem to have instinctively felt.
It is the clearest sort of autobiography
that such a character as Lambert should
have entertained him and amused him and
also caught his imagination. Whenever
Bean refers to him ; “Lambert still in full
uniform and spurs”: always in the friend-
liest fashion —you have Bean every bit as
much as you have George Lambert.
But, as stated, Bean was the historian-
conscience in person, as seen in the fantas-
tic, not to say plain funny, incident
proving that Lambert was not. The amus-
ing little personal conflict that historian,
on the one side, and friend, on the other,
had in Bean’s mind is pointed by his in-
sistence, regarding Will Dyson and Lam-
bert, that “Nothing could have induced
either of these artists to swerve a hair’s-
breadth from what he believed to be the
truth —their integrity was absolute.” As
Bean had shown as recently as the pre-
ceding page, that would take some sup-
porting regarding Lambert as historian-
artist. For more than its light on that,
the incident deserves quoting in full
(Lambert, at this point, is making a first-
hand study of the Anzac setting for his
big painting of the Landing):
I had been answering Lambert’s ques-
tions as to our men’s equipment and dress
at the Landing when Balfour [another mem-
ber of the party] reminded me that the
men of the 3rd Brigade, which landed first,
had been told to rdll up their sleeves to
the elbow, so that in the half-light they
might be distinguished from the Turks.
Like Balfour, I thought this might add
something to the vigor of the picture,
though I did not say so when I mentioned
the fact to Lambert.
“How disgusting,” was all he said. I
think he sensed that we were expecting him
to paint something like the flamboyant illus-
trated-newspaper pictures of the Anzacs
which seldom failed to show their fore-
arms bare. “You know,” he once said to
me, “we constantly picture Australians as
tall, wiry men, whereas the average Aus-
tralian —if there is one —is short and stout.
Look at them next time you’re in the
street.”
However, the original Anzacs were big
men, and Lambert did not make the mis-
take of painting them otherwise. But
nothing could have induced him to turn
up the sleeves of that landing brigade. In
his great picture, of all the scores of climb-
ing men who, in the flat morning light,
almost blend into the color of the scrub,
every one has his sleeves down to the wrist,
and every one wears an Australian hat,
though Lambert knew that they landed in
the little round peaked caps which were the
general wear of the Australian infantry in
that great battle.
“I suppose some wore hats, skipper?”
he asked.
“Certainly,” I said, and that was enough
for him.
Lambert’s “How disgusting! ” is beyond
price—like the complete falseness of his
talking about “average Australians,” as if
the men who stormed Anzac were average
anything. Lambert, as Bean says, finally
painted them as big men, but it’s hard to
think one who could not see the mad
drama of their arms bare to the elbows —a
suicide arrangement anyhow, like those
white armbands of the fight in August—
would have painted them big men even if
they had been average. Lambert’s objec-
tion to the bare arms came from his
disgust-view of war. They were too near
the real thing.
Still, as Bean says, Lambert did give
them the “Anzac uniform” —that is, the
shirts with sleeves hacked off, shorts simi-
larly hacked out; anything, in fact, but
“uniform” —when he came to paint the
charge at The Nek. And as to the
Landing, the hats symbolised what Lam-
bert was intent on setting down, as the
full sleeves of the tunics made the Anzacs
a part of the prickly gorse-like scrubby
growth (some of which, Bean says, turn
out to have been really a dwarf oak).
A most interesting part of the book is
Zeki Bey’s first-person story of Anzac,
and the rest of Gallipoli, from the Turk
point of view. There are several chapters
of Zeki Bey talking, and his account
wonderfully rounds out the story of
Anzac.
Gallop a' Waters.
To have made John Fairfax’s Run o’
Waters (John Sands, Ltd.) as good a book
of travel and nature notes as, say, Robert
Gibbings’s offerings in this kind of litera-
ture, the author would have had to take
up trout-fishing, botany or, perhaps, Yogi
philosophy: anything that might induce
leisure and contemplation.
Mr. Fairfax’s hobby, which is canoeing,
might seem tranquil enough—one im-
agines him, like a large platypus, drifting
gently down the reflections of willows —
but that is an illusion. His book conveys
an impression of breath-taking speed and
unbearable uproar. In pages he has
rushed down the Clarence from Tam-
bulam to the “Copmanhurst Pier”; in
another six pages he has roared down
the Murrumbidgee from Gundagai to
Wagga. And if, apologising for the
“twists and turns” in the cataract of his
narrative, it takes him a whole 14 pages
to do the Clyde from the Pigeon House
to Bateman’s Bay, he quickly atones for
that lapse into (comparative) sluggish-
ness by navigating 250 miles of the Upper
Murray from Khancoban to Howlong in
9% pages ; and in a final triumphant burst
does the Murray from Albury to Tocum-
wal in five pages.
And while he is thus whizzing down
mighty rivers at one of whose pools a
naturalist could spend half a year, Mr.
Fairfax astounds the, silence of centuries
with the outcries of shipwrecked mariners,
with loud and presumably profane ex-
hortations to his “Bosun,” with shouts of
delight as some reckless fish attaches itself
to the spinner whirling madly in his wake,
with the ebullitions of his sense of humor
—which is infectious, sempiternal and
deafening—and with a cannonade from
the shotgun, with which, blazing at the
bow, he announces to the wild duck that
an author is on the water:
“Might I suggest, sir,” the Bosun re-
marked, “that you are lifting the barrage a
little too soon? A more concentrated cur-
tain of fire in the immediate path of the
duck might lead to more beneficial results.”
As a result of all this sound and fury
the barrage from Mr. Fairfax’s type-
writer reads more like the sort of high-
spirited holiday notes that might appear
in any light travel magazine or daily
newspaper —where, in fact, most of these
sketches were first printed—than like a
considered work of literature. The book,
as it stands, is pleasant, for it is ex-
hilarating to be dumped, bumped,
drowned, roared at, joked at and shot at
in Mr. Fairfax’s company, and every sen-
sible Australian dreams of going down
the Murray in a canoe some day, but
the writer might do much better next
time if he took his travelling less rapidly
and himself more seriously.
Mr. Fairfax has, in fact, the right kind
of mind to do this sort of book really
well. He likes rivers, birds, trees, people
and history and, even hurtling through
the countryside as he does, he picks up a
surprising amount of information: on
Yugilbar Castle beside the Clarence; on
Alexander Berry of the Shoalhaven ; on
an old German settler whose three sons,
Big Johnnie, Big Tommy and Big Stevie,
together weighed over 60 stone; on a
kind old lady whom some devoted
kookaburras fed with worms; on the
poet Sydney Jephcott surrounded by his
cypresses, willows and redwoods; on
perch, cod, and on a pair of eaglehawks
that harried a fox ... all well worth
reading about, even at the cost of a
slight singing in the ears.
Ramblings in Rowe Street.
Margaret Mary Pearson’s Tales of
Rowe Street (Angus and Robertson)
is printed in a reproduction of the
author’s handwriting; which, fortunately,
is legible. Each short chapter is decorated
with colored plates representing shop
signboards, like the old-fashioned sign-
boards of inns. And scattered through
the text are decorations that look like old
iron hinges and old iron lamp-brackets.
These are so profuse that there is some
danger of stubbing one’s toe or bumping
one’s head on them, but for all that it is
an attractive publication: odd, fresh,
imaginative. And its material is excep-
tionally lively.
Since the pages are not numbered and
since one could not possibly dog’s-ear it
or scribble on it, a review must rely on
memory; which says that the narrow
lane running between Pitt- and Castle-
reagh-streets in Sydney was named after
a Thomas Rowe who, .after a period on
the Sofala goldfields, practised as an
architect, designed Sydney Hospital and,
as first Mayor of Manly, supervised the
planting of the famous Norfolk pines . . .
that through this narrow lane there
passed, in a long ' velvet dress, a girl
riding a bicycle with her feet on the
handlebars . . . also a string of camels
and donkeys on their way to “Chu Chin
Chow” at the Theatre Royal . . . that
Dattilo Rubbo, brooding above the street
on one of Lionel Lindsay’s cartoons,
thought of challenging the artist to a
duel but was pacified . . . that Sydney
Ure Smith as a small boy used
to pour water from a window at
the Australia on to gentlemen in the
street . . . that a small girl had a roll of
notes eaten by a goat . . . that a man
walked into a barber’s shop opposite the
end of Rowe-street, borrowed a razor to
shave himself, lathered his face and then
calmly cut his throat . . . that Eugene
O’Neill’s “The Hairy Ape” was first
produced in Sydney at Pakie Mac-
dougall’s “Playbox Theatre” . . , that
Rowe-street, in short, runs not only from
Pitt-street to Castlereagh-street but from
Macquarie’s time to today, and that on
every foot of it stands some ghost or
living person worth knowing for his
comedy, his tragedy, his oddity or his
contribution to the arts.
The narrative is told in a kind of artless
prattle which leaves one with the helpless
and not unhappy feeling of being of the
mental age of two. A sterner and more
adult tone would have been desirable for
the horrible (but probably exaggerated)
story of the dumping of a banned book in
Sydney garbage-tins.
Australian Horticulture .
Lothian Publishing Co., Melbourne,
has let itself go on Shrubs and Trees for
Australian Gardens, by Ernest E. Lord,
F.R.H.S. The volume of close on 600
pages is not only an outstanding example
of Australian book-production, but in
the world-class.
It is excellently set out and printed,
charmingly written, comprehensive, and
the illustrations are on a grand scale.
The colored reproductions of Australia’s
quaint and beautiful flora, from the Four-
Wing Mallee to the Queensland Lacebark
—a particularly handsome fellow —avoid
the offensive blatancy of the techi|icolor
movie, and the full-page photos are
arrestingly descriptive.
Mr. Lord has packed into his book a
wealth of information —as to what to
grow and where and when to grow it —
for Australian municipal gardens, seaside
gardens, over-wet soils and the hot, dry
soils of the inland. One learns with
relief that the double ii termination to
many names of species in the necessary
but awful Latin nomenclature has been
abandoned for the single i; that the acacia
got its name of wattle from the building-
habits of early settlers in Sydney; that
Grafton, N.S.W., has an annual festival
at jacaranda-time attended by 10,000
people; and that Populus nigra italica
is a handsome tree but a suburban pest
which has unfortunately been too widely
planted in small gardens.
By dividing this continent into horti-
cultural zones —Southern Victoria, Ade-
laide, Northern Victoria, Sydney, etc, —
Mr. Lord makes it easy for the grower
to select from the multitudinous varieties
of Nature’s and man’s making a hedge, a
breakwind or a garden suitable to ever/
climate. And even in his scientific classi-
fications he writes about trees as if he
loved them.
A collected uniform edition of the
novels of William Gerhardi is being pub-
lished by Macdonald and Co. Gerhardi
has not had much attention in recent
years but was highly thought of when his
books were first published, about 20 years
ago. Titles already in print—with more
to follow —are Futility, The Polyglots,
My Sinful Earth (previously published as
Jazz and Jasper ), The Memoirs of Satan,
Pending Heaven and Resurrection. As
the titles indicate, Gerhardi’s novels are
in line with the prevailing fashion of
mysticism in English fiction.
Ron Randell in Hollywood : Ron
Randell (Commonwealth Publications

Ron would like to “dedicate this little
book to the many Australian boys and
girls who have given me loyalty and sup-
port, and to express the hope that they
may enjoy , some of my Hollywood ex-
periences with me.” And, as an account
of those experiences, ending with some
pious aspirations concerning the talkies
as an instrument for world peace, it’s not
too bad. Over to you, boys and girls.

What does “The rising of the
Court” mean ?
It is a sentence imposed by courts
of summary jurisdiction in cases where
the offence is trivial. The convicted
person is sentenced to imprisonment
“until the rising of the Court,” which
means that he is to be detained in
custody until the Court adjourns for
lunch or, if the sentence is imposed
in the afternoon, till the end of the
Court’s day.

JO'S
LUGGAGE
By
E.O.
SGHLUNKE
S_ , 1 HERE was nothing remarkable
about Jo when he was de-
posited at Alex Denholm’s
farm, unless it was the quan-
tity of his luggage, which did
seem a bit excessive even for
an Italian prisoner-of-war,
most of whom persistently irritated their
Australian guards by insisting on carrying
around large quantities of goods of
negligible value, mysteriously acquired in
Egypt, India and elsewhere.
He was a bright, alert fellow, of better
shape than most, being broader of
shoulder and slimmer of hips, so that he
fitted his maroon-dyed Australian uni-
form passably well, and he carried him-
self in an erect, soldierly manner.
i i T_J E says that he belonged to a
H famous regiment,” said the Con-
trol Centre sergeant, rather amused at
the idea of any Italian regiment being
famous.
Alex thought he looked a bit tense
and highly strung, but decided that it
was natural enough for a member of the
Bersaglieri (the regiment that never ran
away) to fret in captivity. He asked him
if he could speak English.
“A little, but not too much,” said Jo
promptly.
“You speak it very well,” said Alex,
surprised at the excellence of his pro-
nunciation.
“The study of languages,” said Jo, a
little more unsteadily this time, “is both
interesting and profitable.”
“My word, you’re quite a professor,
Alex said, smiling.
But he soon discovered that these two
sentences were about all the English Jo
could speak. He looked at Jo’s astonish-
ing assortment of luggage and noticed
a huge suitcase, which at first glance
looked like leather but on closer exami-
nation proved to be made very neatly of
tin, with all the fastenings and fittings
cleverly contrived of makeshift materials,
and cunningly painted.
“You fare this?” Alex asked, pointing.
“Yes,” Jo said modestly.
“Very good, very good,” said Alex,
warmly; he always found that a bit of
praise went a long way in establishing
goodwill, and he knew that a handy-man
would be valuable to him.
But Jo shook his head and gave the
suitcase a kick with his toe to show
what it was made of.
“Iron,” he said, with a lot of emphasis
on the “r,” in the Italian manner, “no
good iron.”
Then he slung it up on his shoulder
and marched off to his room, swinging
the other arm meticulously from the
shoulder.
WHEN Mrs. Denholm discovered that
Jo was a handy-man there was no
end of the jobs she wanted done ; kitchen
utensils irreplaceable due to war short-
ages to be mended, furniture to be re-
paired.
At every interval in the major work
of the farm he toiled over them indus-
triously in the workshop, taking great
pains to do the work neatly and effec-
tively, looking extremely serious all the
while, and never breaking into song as
most Italians were apt to do when left
alone at some congenial occupation.
At mealtimes he would tear himself
away reluctantly from his work and come
in for dinner a few yards behind the fat
and ungraceful Maringoni, marching so
proudly in the Bersaglieri manner that
Ina, the maid, always watched him from
the window, and Mrs. Denholm looked
out sometimes and admired him. Even
during the evenings and on Sundays Jo
worked away at Mrs. Denholm’s repairs.
Wien Alex assured him that he was not
expected to work so hard, he said:
“Madame, I like want to repair good
for me.”
And he looked so sure he was speaking
good English that Alex let it go at that,
though he was by no means sure whether
Jo was doing it because “Madame”
wanted it, or because he liked it, or
because he liked “Madame,” or because
he thought the occupation good for him.
Anyhow,“Madame” liked Jo much better
than any other prisoner and she often
allowed the two small boys to go to the
workshop to watch him.
At first they kept at a distance, as if
he was some strange animal, but soon
young David (being little more than a
baby and accustomed to being misunder-
stood) began to chatter amiably to him.
Jo gave him a friendly glance now and
then, and said “O, Davide,” in a tactfully
reproachful manner if he carried off any
of his tools.
ON the first occasion that Alex went
to town after Jo’s arrival, the two
men, having attended to the needs of the
car and pushed it
out of the garage,
were standing by to
see the family de-
part, Maringoni, as.
usual, looking wist-
ful. Alex asked them
if there was anything
he could bring them, and Jo looked on
with the greatest interest at the system of
barter Alex and Maringoni had devised.
The prisoners received no money, and
it was an offence to give them any, but
they could draw on their credit from the
p.-0.-w. canteen, from which they got a
regular supply of tobacco and cigarettes
when tobacco was scarce. Thus Marin-
goni had built up a credit with Alex, by
means of which he was able to acquire
a number of comforts his soul craved;
some oranges for the benefit of his*
“salut,” some coffee essence for the better
entertainment of his visitors from other
farms.
After the next visit of the “canteena”
Jo came to Alex with his hands full of
the low-quality tobacco deemed to be
suitable for p.-0.-w., and asked Alex
rather wistfully:
“How much price one good luggage?”
Alex told him that good luggages were
not available, and even if they had been
they would be too expensive for his
modest purchasing-power. Jo looked
most discouraged for some days, and
Maringoni reported to Alex that he was
“no contento,” and sat miserably all the
evening, doing nothing.
But when Alex went to town again,
Jo asked him to bring him a piece of
canvas about a foot square. He explained
that he wanted to paint a picture; he
was “no artiste” but it would “passo di
tempo” at night, when he had nothing
to do.
T O had a small colored picture of the
Virgin and child in his pocket
“Testamento,” and he undertook to make
an enlarged copy by the schoolboy
method of using a grid of small squares
on the picture, and a correspondingly
larger grid on his canvas. Jo occupied
all his spare time on it, working with
serious concentration, slowly and pain-
stakingly because he lacked skill and tne
right materials. The little boys were
vastly interested in it, and spent so muc
time watching him that they learnt the
Italian names of all his colors, and witn
that, and what words he picked up from
them, there was soon quite a lot they
could say to each
other. It took many
weeks to finish, then
he showed it to Alex,
full of modest pride
and apprehension.
Despite all the
trouble Jo had taken
the Virgin had a swollen forearm and an
undeniable goitre, while the Child had a
grievously deformed leg. But Alex said
firmly that he liked it very much, and
when Jo asked him he assured him that
“Madame” would undoubtedly like it
too.
NEXT Sunday morning Ina, from the
window, announced that Jo was
bringing something in with him for
breakfast.
“No,” she amended, a minute later,
“he’s going back. Now he’s coming
without it—now he’s stopped again—he’s
going back —he’s got it again—now he’s
stopped again. He’s talking to himself
he’s started again and he’s bringing it
in."
Jo came in the door quite pale with
excitement. He had the picture in a
matching frame he had made for it, under
his arm, and after a final fearful fit of
hesitation he handed it to Mrs. Denholm,
and recited a carefully prepared English
speech.
“You will have this for kindness
for” and then, oddly enough, he
couldn’t remember the word “remember”
and ended in a panic, “ricordo mio.”
Mrs. Denholm was quite touched at
this proof of Jo’s devotion. She examined
it minutely at arm’s length, exclaiming:
“Oh, Jo, it’s lovely; it’s beautiful.
Thank you very much.”
When Jo sat down eventually he could
hardly eat for emotion. Later in the
day he told Alex that he was “More and
most happy” on his farm, and that he
wanted very much to be aUowed to re-
main there until all the prisoners
returned to Italy. ..
Alex told Jo that all the fam y
fond of him, and they snuled at eacn
other in the greatest “accordo.
BUT with his masterpiece off hisi
hands, Jo’s mind returned to old
desires. He asked Alex hopefully (as if
his present high standing with the family
might enhance his chances) if it was
“now poseebile comprare one good lug-
gage.” But suitcases were scarcer
than before, and it began to look as if
Jo might suffer a steep decline in morale
until the day when, helping Alex clean
out an old lumber room, he found a very
large cardboard box.
He seized it in his hands and stood
there with his eyes bright with ideas. He
asked Alex if he could have it to fab-
rique luggage.” Alex told him it wasn t
strong enough. But Jo said with a
knowing smile:
“Me understand, but you no under-
stand.”
Alex understood next Sunday when
Jo invited him into his room to see his
latest essay in handicraft. He had cut
the box into the shape of the two sections
of a suitcase, and was adding strength
to it by pasting layers of brown paper
over the cardboard.
Jo explained that he would need about
fifty layers of brown paper to make it as
strong as he desired. Since each layer
had to be carefully glued into place with
no creases or air pockets or loose places,
and each sheet had to be perfectly dry
before the next was applied, to avoid
disastrous warping of the finished pro-
duct, it looked like being a masterpiece
of patience and tenacity.
DURING the next two months, while
the British and American armies
were overrunning Italy and many of the
prisoners were frantic with worry as their
home towns were “liberated,” Jo bore up
very well. Every night he pasted another
sheet of paper on to his “luggage,” and
each Sunday the prisoners who came to
see the sociable Maringoni examined its
progress and gravely discussed its possi-
bilities.
Jo consumed enormous quantities of
brown-paper, but his friendship with
Alex’s little boys helped to keep up the
supply for some time. Whenever Jo
needed more they raided the pantry,
where they knew that their mother care-
fully stored away all the best sheets.
When that supply was exhausted, they
seized the parcels as soon as they came
home from town, unwrapping them in a
feverish hurry, exclaiming as they scat-
tered the goods over the tables and on to
the floor,
“This will be a good piece for Jo’s
luggage”; “This is a better one, it’s
thicker.” And if Mrs. Denholm attempted
to keep any for herself they protested in
so outraged a manner, or wept so feel-
ingly, that she had to give in to them.

Time Throws Its Spray.
Full moon, and color like bleached gold
Lights up the Spectre in the tree
Where something slips the earth’s fast
hold
Of age and time and comes to me.
Not air but silence is the breath
The trees breathe in, where hills surround
The valleys ancient with the death
Of lakes and rivers, forests bound
Deep in the night of earth’s black
ground;
But in my heart the feet of time
Race over worlds whose dreams resound
Their murmur trickling in my rhyme —
Of waters bursting the cold spray
Of time against our golden day.

BELOW CAPRICORN.
I.
Five kookaburras sitting on the wire
Filch a moment from the world with their harsti
choir .
Of indigent voices that subside, dilate,
Then flap into silence. The farmer opens the
gate;
Its hinges creak and grind and the noon is again
Cacophonous. Autumn is in pain,
Bleeding golden in a field of corn. .
The Jersey bull roars where the tilted earth is
Into t a f gap for the bright creek rustling beneath
The dangling fence whose brown wires sing by
the breath „ . , , .
Of an inland wind a dirge of erosion and lost
Foundations. To the lone suspended post
Has gathered flood-wrack and twin atmospheres
That only moods command. In boisterous airs
It dances like a clumsy puppet dressed
In straw, clowning for a season; in gales
Of grey winters at the haunted mind’s behest
It sags like a hanged man in chains with tales
Of murder round him and the sinister squeak
Of iron in the' wind and the slow reek
Of beauty newly slaughtered.
The farmer whistles
The blue dog from his lair behind the dairy;
He comes mincing through the alien thistles,
Strong head quizzical, light as a fairy.
Man and dog go down the track slowly
Under the moderate sun. The gums in the holy
Cathedral-light of noon are immaculate
In their white trunk-vestments and murmur love,
their great
Kind arms upheld in solemn incantation;
Only the lonely kurrajong is irreligious.
As its wanton crows in philandering exclamation
Plunder the hour of dream. High and pro-
digious
The Bunya mountains meet the sky and hold
Dark aboriginalities and old
Legends that shall finally die and come *
Down to the valley and the roads in dust,
Crumbling in the territory of their home
Unapprehended, fugitive, am} lost.
The farmer with a comical kick
Abstractedly clears the broken lane of a stick
Before turning into the bottom field where roans
And browns in their cattle-communities among
stones
And weeds crop grass, chew cuds, and bellow
like fools;
Their dull-lidded eyes, like the depths of stag-
nant pools,
Reflect non-entity. These two are
Their intelligence. They only lurch and lumber,
Moan for water, give milk, lie down for slumber,
And breed, as humans, by a commonplace law.
Man and dog are their certainty as the sun
Is their light and a star their darkness.
From the dun
Shadows of boundary scrub a turkey calls;
In the giant bottle-tree tiny squalls,
Of sparrows’ stutter rise and rush downhill,
Breaking on gibber-silence and adamant stumps—
Persistent growths in the hill’s side —then spill
And bubble out among the grass-tree clumps.
This is the time when the country stirs like a
child
In sleep, fretting a little, feeling how sound
And movement intrude like awakening on its
mild
Unimaginable dream. Underground
Some motive sends the cold spring flowering
in spray
Among the ferns, a translucent lily of day,
Whose opaque whisper in drought is the one
spring song
Unannihilated, slenderly strong.
lI.—SOLILOQUY.

To stumble sixty years upon it and find

Of cathedral fields; let me be everlasting.
The baptised holder of your elixirs
(Gum-sap, creek-water, honey of the wild beet,

On frosty mornings, hands cupped in gesture
Of drinking or chiselled attitude of prayer
(If ever there was a suppliant god), I shall know
This country below Capricorn for moments
Greater than legendary Greece has had.
HL—THE FARMER’S REPLY.
Extravagance will dry like the sap of my body
That bends before the bloodwood shall to the
dust.
Sixty years have brought me little closer
Than a wren’s song at morning to the dream
The earth sighs in; so hope not for sudden
Revelation. Be content that the dream is,
And though we may know it only when Death
has fastened
A lid on our communion with the world,
Its presence grants us wisdom in our days
And holds our hands to labor though drought-
time turn
The country brittle and break the heart almost.

Of fairytales the fable or phantasy,
The windmill, like a skeletal tree with a vaned

Over the ground of their circumstance men

Bewildered with purpose, till blundering into a

PEACE AT STALIN’S PRICE.
In the weighty warning he de-
livered at Cambridge on June 10
—that “Soviet Communism, in-
toxicated with its successes, is
directing a sustained, ruthless
and aggressive advance against
an exhausted, war-weary and dis-
appointed West” and must be
stopped —General Smuts would
have in mind the current wide-
spread sentiment for peace at
practically any price.
Speaking recently in America,
Lord Rothermere touched on the
same topic, stating that a peace-
at-any-price sentiment exists in
Europe. He regarded it as a
real danger ; meaning an invita-
tion to Russia to change from
snarling to open aggression.
General Smuts held rather to
the now-official U.S. view-—that
Russia, while continuing to act
aggressively, does not want war ;
at any rate, not while it can get
what it wants by trading on war
fears.
“Russia,” General Smuts
said, “is exploiting Western
Europe’s fears of war, and will
continue as long as she thinks
she can play the game without
the risk of real war.” The results
of this, however, unless Russia
is stopped, “might be as devas-
tating to human freedom as war
itself.” Actually, to many mil-
lions of people it has already
been quite as devastating.
The peace-at-any-price sup-
porters these speakers had in
mind would seem to include even
those who still can’t mention
Neville Chamberlain without
a sneer, though any price
Chamberlain paid was micro-
scopic compared to what so
many would now apparently be
ready to give away to avoid
war.
Scripps-Howard foreign editor
William Philip Simms, report-
ing on his recent visit to Europe,
says he found few Europeans
who did not regard the idea of
war with horror; and the
Kremlin, Simms added, “knows
that the West is war-weary.
It knows, too, that the West
is unprepared, that it is less
prepared today than it was
in 1938-39, both mentally and
physically.” Referring to the
feeling of Europeans generally,
he asked: “If Stalin suddenly
confronted these people with an
ultimatum such as Mr. Chamber-
lain and Mr. Daladier faced at
Munich, what would happen?”
One thing, apparently, that
would happen would be a howl
for peace at Stalin’s price by
many of those who only 10
years ago were loudest for war,
though on Stalin’s record of
broken pledges—which even out-
Hitlers Hitler —the Kremlin’si
word is utterly worthless. As
William Henry Chamberlin, in
“Wall-street Journal,” comments
on a recent outcry; “One
wonders if the persons who go
all-out for a Stalin-Truman con-
ference are familiar with the
Soviet Prime Minister’s ‘good-
faith’ record.”
In a review of that record
which makes the conference
advocates a joke, Chamberlin
recalls Stalin’s public announce-
ment in the ’thirties: “We shall
not yield an inch of our own
soil; we do not covet a foot of
foreign soil.” It is noteworthy,
comments Chamberlin, that he
did not say: “We do not covet
a foot of foreign soil—except
Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,
Eastern Poland, Bessarabia,
Northern Bukovina, Petsamo,
the Karelian Isthmus, Koenigs-
berg. Eastern Czechoslovakia,
South Sakhalin, the Kurile Is-
lands.” Yet that is a list of
direct Soviet annexations of
foreign soil during and since the
war, some details of which the
authority on Soviet history goes
on to review. A mere outline
adds up to a more than sufficient
reason why the much-advocated
“talks” between Stalin and Tru-
man would be worse than a
waste of time. It makes even
Washington “Post.”
“I WANT A LIVE ONE!”
Smuts’s comment that “The new
technique of conquest without
war has proved so successful it
has all but proved a substitute
for war itself” sound like a con-
siderable understatement.
The Soviet Union, by force
and threat of force, in no case
by the freely expressed consent
of the peoples concerned, has
annexed over 270,000 square
miles of additional territory in
Europe and Asia, inhabited by
almost 25,000,000 people. By
methods of more indirect
aggression, including the ruth-
less use of Communist fifth-
columns, it has reduced 10
countries and regions of eastern
and central Europe to vassal
status, namely Poland, Rumania,
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czecho-
slovakia, Finland, Hungary,
Albania, and the Soviet zones of
Germany and Austria. This re-
presents an area of over 600,000
square miles, a population of
over 100,000,000 human beings.
The Soviet Union, on its own
initiative, concluded treaties of
non-aggression and neutrality,
based on respect for existing
frontiers, with its five Western
neighbors, Poland, Finland,
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia,
in 1932. It broke every one of
these treaties, partitioning
Poland with Hitler and attack-
ing Finland without provocation
in 1939, forcibly annexing the
three Baltic republics in 1940,
The Soviet Union became a
member of the League of
Nations in 1934 and assumed the
obligations of the League Coven-
ant, It broke the Covenant by
conspiring with Hitler against
the independence of League
members, Poland, Latvia, Lithu-
ania and Estonia, and more
openly by invading Finland and
refusing League mediation. For
this last act of aggression it was
expelled from the League by
unanimous vote.
The Soviet Government on
several occasions announced its
acceptance of the principles of
the Atlantic Charter, which in-
cluded renunciation of territorial
aggrandisement and respect for
the right of every people to self-
determination. But, as shown,
it has carried out a vast scheme
of annexation and has not sub-
mitted even one of its annexa-
tions to the test of a free and
fair plebiscite. Every new addi-
tion of territory was accom-
panied by mass arrests and de-
portations and other forms of
terror.
The Soviet Government, at
Yalta in February, 1945, and at
Potsdam in July-August, 1945,
concluded agreements with the
United States and Great Britain
which were highly advantageous
to its interests; but it did
assume obligations under those
agreements. Stalin, as well as
Roosevelt and Churchill, signed
his name to the propositions that
there should be “free and un-
fettered elections in Poland” and
that there should be Soviet-
Anglo-American co-operation in
assisting the liberated peoples of
Europe in solving “by demo-
cratic means their pressing poli-
tical and economic problems.”
But the only election held in
post-war Poland, by the virtually
unanimous testimony of foreign
observers who watched it, was
a fraudulent farce. And the
Soviet Union has treated the
whole vast area its armies occu-
pied during the last months of
the war as a closed political and
economic preserve.
In the Potsdam document
there were two constructive
ideas—that Germany should be
.treated as an economic unit, and
that democratic parties in Ger-
many should be encouraged.
The Soviet authorities have flag-
rantly violated both these stipu-.
lations.
The Soviet Government broke
its treaty obligations to with-
draw troops from Iran six
months after the end of the
war. It broke its non-aggression
treaty with Japan, certainly not
out of moral indignation
against Japanese imperialism,
but in order to grab what it
could in Manchuria and North
Korea.
So the list goes on, through
Iran, China and elsewhere, such
a record of bad faith that, as
Chamberlin comments: “If
American officials who know the
Soviet historical record are a
bit cool about the prospects of
a Truman-Stalin conference this
does not indicate that they are
bloodthirsty warmongers. It
merely indicates that they have
learned a little common sense
after the costly and disastrous
experiments of Yalta, Potsdam
and innumerable lesser confer-
ences.”
U.S. Defence “Line.”
Quoting U.S. “defence and
diplomatic officials,” a Washing-
ton correspondent of “Wall-street
Journal” gives the defence “line”
the U.S. will not tolerate Russia’s
overstepping.
The “line” runs roughly along
the borders on the far or
“Russian side” of Norway,
Western Germany, Western
Austria, Trieste-Italy, Greece
and Turkey, and is based on the
practicability of military and
political aid. Finland and
Sweden “are considered not de-
pendable.” So are Iran (Persia)
and Afghanistan.
No “line” is being drawn in
Eastern Asia, U.S. military and
diplomatic strategists holding
that priority must go to Europe.
“They believe Russia’s eyes are
on the West; that the Kremlin
is not now prepared to put pres-
sure on Eastern Asia.”
In the “non-dependable” area,
however, the U.S. will continue
active, supplying “minor
amounts of money for recovery”
and backing up the various
countries diplomatically against
Russia. For example, the U.S.
is aiding Sweden through the
Marshall Plan, American
military and police advisers are
improving the Iranian (Persian)
army and police and American
fiscal experts, teachers and
geologists are aiding Afghani-
stan.
The basis of the “contain-
ment” policy bastioned along the
quoted “line” is actually a revers-
ing of the Communist belief in
a “capitalist” breakdown. The
theory, as reversed, is that “if
Russia can be held on one line,
and if the U.S. waits long
enough, Russian expansionism
will grow so weak from within
it will no longer be a major
menace.”
Sister Kenny.
As reported by Washington
“Post,” a Congress House Com-
mittee “was shocked by the
‘brush-off’ given the Kenny
treatment for infantile paralysis”
by a leading national organisa-
tion concerned with combating
that disease.
Sister Kenny told the House
Committee that medical theory
holds that the disease is a
paralysis, hi which the nerves do
not carry signals to the muscles.
But 38 years ago, she said, she
discovered that the trouble is
not with the nerves, but with
the muscles, which are twisted
by spasms, so she began treating
the muscles directly.
She told the committee that if
she had been allowed to show
her evidence to the national
organisation it would have
proved that 85 out of 100
patients treated by the Kenny
method got well, and the other
15 did better than under accepted
methods. She said, too, that
none of 6000 patients treated
at the Kenny Institute in Minne-
apolis needed operations and
that her method prevented many
serious after-effects.
Anti-Spain.
A correspondence discussion
in London “Times” has shown
a good deal of opinion strongly
opposed to the continued
ostracising of Spain.
Major Guy Lloyd, M.P., de-
clared: “Although few have the
courage to say so, everyone
knows in fact that the Union of
Western Europe is a union
against the Communist menace
and in defence of European
civilisation against possible
aggression by Soviet Russia and
her satellites,
“How much longer,” he ques-
tioned, “can we afford to ignore
Spain? To treat her as outside
the pale of European civilisation,
forbid her to join the United
Nations, refuse to invite her to
join the Western European
Union, and rejoice at her con-
tinued exclusion from participa-
tion in the European Recovery
Plan? Spain was the first
Western European nation to
fight successfully against anarchy
and Communism. Almost all the
present European Communist
leaders Dimitrov (Bulgaria),
Gottwald (Czechoslovakia),
Tito (Yugoslavia), Francois
Victor (France), Scotti (Italy)—
and scores of other notorious
Communists took part in the
fighting in the civil war in Spain
on behalf of Communism and
anarchy, actively supported by
Soviet Russia. These men are to-
day among the leaders of Com-
munism in Europe.
“Spain is a proud, Christian,
civilised, cultured nation,
situated in a most important
strategic part of Western Europe,
She is the only completely anti-
Communist stronghold in
Europe; the 1 second - largest
nation in Western Europe, com-
prising a population of some 23
million people.”
On a recent visit to Spain
Major Lloyd found that
“Spaniards are agreed that there

is no alternative to Franco at
the present time except a return
to chaos and anarchy, which
would ultimately lead to a re-
currence of civil war, which is
exactly what the Communists
desire and which would, if suc-
cessful, completely vitiate the
strength and influence of the
Western European Union.”
Describing “this continued
spite against Spain” as “a legacy
of the period of appeasement of
Soviet Russia, now happily be-
ginning to disappear,” the writer
concluded: “What right have we
to dictate to the Spanish people
what form of government they
should have? . . . Our con-
tinued refusal to allow Spain
to participate in the defence of
Western civilisation is a triumph
for Communist propaganda and
an act of extreme folly.”
Mission to Malaya.
Canberra’s “goodwill mission”
to Malaya was greeted in the
Singapore “Straits Times” by the
accompanying cartoon and by a
leading article dealing with
causes of the hostility encoun-
tered.
Referring to news from Can-
berra suggesting that the mission
was arranged by Dr. Evatt
“after receiving a report from
the Australian Government
Commissioner in Singapore, Mr.
Claude Massey, which gave the
Commonwealth Cabinet a nasty
jolt by its emphasis on the grow-
ing hostility in Malaya towards
Australia’s exclusive racial pol-
icy,” the “Straits Times” com-
mented : “If Mr. Massey has so
reported to Canberra, he has
spoken nothing but the truth,
and the diplomatic mission on
which our visitors are engaged
is indeed a delicate one, having
regard to the irritated and sen-
sitive state of Asian feeling on
the White Australia issue in
Malaya today.”
Before the war, the newspaper
added, the White Australia pol-
icy “was never even discussed”
in Malaya, but a new awareness
of Australia had meanwhile been
brought about by various
causes: the A.I.F. forces sent
to Singapore; the “very large
number of Malayan refugees” in
Australia during the war; the
“vastly increased importance of
Australia as a source of supplies”
since then ; and “the growing
number of young Malayans who
are going to Australian uni-
versities.” The paper went on
to explain how recent acts of
Mr. Calwell had provoked hos-
tility in three different classes:
“First, a few Malays who had
settled in Australia during the
war and had taken unto them-
selves white wives were rounded
up and deported. Since there
were known to be many hun-
dreds of Malays living in Aus-
tralia, the inability of Australia’s
Immigration-Minister, Mr. Cal-
well, to find room for a dozen
more on that continent was not
appreciated by the Malays of
Singapore and the Federation.
“Then Mr. Calwell discovered
a Straits Chinese wife of a white
Australian living in Perth, This
couple had married in Singapore,
had evacuated to Perth before
the fall, and had been living
there peacefully ever since. Mr.
Calwell decided that the unfor-
tunate woman was not good
enough to live in Australia
either; so a deportation order
was made against her, too ; with
the result that the Straits-born
Chinese in Malaya joined the
Malays in an entirely new re-
sentment against the White Aus-
tralia policy.
“Finally there has been, in a
House of Commons question at
Westminster, an echo of the case
°f a Eurasian in Australia
whom Mr. Calwell has decided
to banish because his mother
w as a Burmese. That has made
the Eurasian community of
Malaya see that they are in the
same boat as their Malay and
Chinese neighbors, so far as
White Australia is concerned.”
i( Though allowing these to be
“all minor incidents in them-
selves,” the “Straits Times”
declared it to be “vitally im-
portant for Australia to under-
stand that incidents such as these
touch one of the deepest and
most vital things in the Asian
mind —racial pride.”
The “Straits Times” further
commented; “It is not the
barrier maintained by Australia
against Asian settlement that
causes the trouble: educated
Singapore “Straits Times.”
THE OLIVE BRANCH.
Asians understand the social and
economic difficulties that arise
when Asian labor competes with
white labor, and when racial
elements which do not assimilate
through intermarriage are taken
into a small and growing nation
such as Australia. But Mr. Cal-
well suddenly decides that a few
respectable Asian or Eurasian
individuals who have been living
in Australia for years must be
uprooted, forced to give up thei»
jobs, break up their homes and
families, and go back to Asia—
that is when the White Australia
policy offends racial pride in
Malaya, for in acting thus Mr.
Calwell seems unreasonable,
harsh, and provocative.”
An Anti-Corn. Bill.
Cables reported the picketing
of the White House, with negro
singer Robeson among the
leaders, in protest against the
Mundt-Nixon anti-Communist
bill.
William Henry Chamberlin
explains the bill in a “Wall-street
Journal” article: “Between
freedom of thought and expres-
sion, which no sensible American
wishes to curb, and overt acts
of treason, espionage and sabot-
age, which can be dealt with
under existing legislation, there
is an uncertain no-man’s land of
conspirative and semi-conspira-
tive activity in which the Com-
munists and their fringe of fel-
low-travellers are busily en-
gaged. The Mundt-Nixon bill
tries to clear up this no-man’s
land, to deal with Communism
as a fifth-column without becom-
ing involved in the undesirable
absurdity of trying to outlaw
Communism as an idea,”
A sweeping bill, it makes it
a crime to “attempt in any man-
ner” to establish a totalitarian
dictatorship under foreign con-
trol in the United States. It
makes it unlawful for a member
of a Communist political organi-
sation to seek Federal employ-
ment without revealing his
membership and denies passports
to such members. It requires
the registration with the
Attorney-General of Communist
political organisations and
Communist-front organisations,
together with the publication of
the names and addresses of
officers and an accounting of
money received. Contributions
to such organisations may not
be deducted for income-tax pur-
poses and mail sent out under
their auspices must be labelled.
It would also be unlawful for an
individual to become a member
of a Communist political organi-
sation if it is not registered.
That is, the bill aims to com-
pel Communists and Communist-
front organisations to operate
in the open, without benefit of
camouflage. It was duly passed
by the House of Representatives,
but there were doubts about
both its Constitutionality and
enforceability if it became law.
One thing the enforcing would
be up against would be Com.
deviousness, including that of
their real directors. Chamber-
lin points out: “It would be
difficult to establish legal proof
that the majority of Communists
are in direct communication with
Moscow. For the Soviet leaders
run their fifth-columns by
methods of remote control.
Louis Budenz, the disillusioned
ex-Communist editor, tells how
Moscow’s agents in this country
are kept under the closest con-
cealment, with their identities
unknown except to the highest
members of the Communist-
party hierarchy. The rank-and-
file Communist-party member
does not get sealed instructions
with a Moscow postmark. He
gets his orders from the party
leadership, which keeps in touch
with Moscow’s desires by various
devious channels.”
Empire Defence.
In his book Twentieth Cen-
tury Empire, recently published
in London, A. V. Hodson, who
headed the Empire division of
the British Ministry of Informa-
tion, holds that -another world
war might well be prevented by
the countries of the British Com-
monwealth standing together as
“a third great Power.”
They should not, he argues,
leave the hegemony of the world
to the rivalry of America and
Russia.
On Commonwealth defence,
he holds that in spite of the
atomic bomb and long-range
rockets, the shock troops in
battle for world peace are still
navies, armies and air forces,
disposed and equipped for arrest-
ing or participating in any dis-
turbance of the territorial order.
“This conclusion,” Hodson
states, “is of great importance
for the British Commonwealth,
as for any other groups of like-
minded nations. The advent of
the atomic bomb may tempt
them to neglect the immediate
means of joint territorial defence,
in favor of co-operation at the
level of science, industry and
long-distance mechanical war-
fare. This may help them in the
end to win wars, but it cannot
serve to prevent wars.
“The problem of joint defence
for the British Commonwealth
is certainly not outmoded or
diminished by the coming of the
atomic bomb. Its essential ob-
jective is preservation of the
territorial order, its essential
means those adapted to securing
that objective. Territorial —that
is to say, regional—co-operation
is therefore still a vital element
in the British Commonwealth
defence.”
Meanwhile, Hodson also sug-
gests, the crucial twentieth-cen-
tury problem of the British
Commonwealth countries is to
find means of saving the free-
dom of the individual from
State supremacy and the true
function of the State from class
domination.
De Gaulle’s Aims.
In a letter to N.Y. “Times”
correcting impressions of De
Gaulle prevalent in America, as
elsewhere, world-known French
playwright Henri Bernstein in-
sists that De Gaulle is the hope
of democracy in France —very
far from the ambitious dictator
usually depicted.
In Bernstein’s view, France,
though “led by sincere demo-
crats,” is not now a full de-
mocracy; “It is extremely diffi-
cult to maintain an entirely
democratic regime in a country
in which a large Communist
party functions, a fifth-column
strongly organised and heavily
represented in Parliament and in
the Administration. The whole
political scene is distorted. The
only two wholly genuine de-
mocracies are the United States
and England, whose citizens will
not permit the intervention in
their affairs of enemies of their
liberties.” (Maybe he overlooked
Australia —or perhaps not.)
As to what De Gaulle wants
for France, he answers: “A
Constitution on the lines of
America’s; a strong and stable
executive, an independent legis-
lature, with clear and definite
rights, a separate judiciary. To
believe,” the writer concludes,
“that De Gaulle is capable of
any attempt to seize power is so
absurd that hardly any French-
man of any political creed
would consider the idea.”
One other thing De Gaulle
wants for France secure
arrangements against a revived
unified Germany, and against,
particularly, such a Germany
grouped round a Sovietised
Prussia, And a lot of French-
men agree with him.
Kremlin Tactics.
Soviet tactics in Germany,
Greece, in U.N.O. and in other
quarters since the war, like Com
tactics everywhere outside the
iron curtain, have generally pro-
duced —in American rearma-
ment, the West European Union,
the Italian elections, etc. —results
the very opposite from what the
Kremlin would like.
“Whatever the reason for the
strange policy the Russians are
pursuing,” David Lawrence has
commented in N, Y. “Sun,” “the
effect inside the United States
has been to accelerate the pas-
sage of appropriations increas-
ing the size of the armed services.
The Russians may have the mis-
taken idea that in an election
year'Mr. Truman would hesitate
to take a positive stand in resist-
ing Russian encroachments. But
the Moscow strategists never
made a worse mistake. For if
there is one thing likely to bring
the domestic parties together, it
is a war crisis.”
Lawrence adds, that the
present “general belief in Wash-
ington is that the Russians will
not force a break, but almost
everybody admits there is little
to go on except logic—and the
Russians have their own peculiar
kind.”
Dragnet Digest.
Jewish Loyalty. Though not as
vocal as the Zionists, many Jewish
Australians would endorse the mes-
sage sent to the Grand Rabbi of
Egypt by two Jewish members of the
Egyptian Government (reported by
N. Y. “Times”): “Following the
proclamation of the Jewish Slate by
the Jewish Agency and its claim that
this was done with the support of
world Jewry, we challenge the pos-
sibility that Jewry is at the same
time a religion and a nation. Please
note that our nationality is Egyptian,
our religion Judaism and our father-
land Egypt.”
* * * *
U.S. Relief-aid. A few figures
from N. Y. “World-Telegram” for
comparing against the Soviet effort to
prevent the war-wrecked world’s re-
covery : “The United States spent
$9,000,000,000 in 1946 and 1947 to
keep people from starving. It is
spending $5,300,000,000 this year. It
plans to spend about $4,000,000,000
a year during 1949, 1950 and 1951.”
* * * *
Nazi Feeling Survives. —Going by
a report in N. Y. “Times” of an
actual recent experience in Germany
the purging of Nazism hasn’t got very
far. In an election for Lord Mayor
of a good-sized town near Stuttgart
one of the candidates was Franz
Konrad, an S.A. (Storm Troop)
officer and Lord Mayor *of the town
during the Hitler regime. Konrad had
been cleared of Nazi guilt by a
German tribunal; but during the
campaign his supporters sang the Nazi
hymn—the “Horst Wessel Lied” —and
painted the Jewish Star of David on
the pavement outside his opponent’s
shop. Konrad was elected.
* * * *
One Clause Honored. When the
Kremlin doesn’t break all of a treaty-
agreement that’s news! U.S. Am-
bassador Bedell Smith, in the course
of his “showdown” statement to
Molotov, caustically pointed out that
(merely an example) “the only pro-
vision of the Roosevelt-Litvinov
Agreement which had not been vio-
lated b’y the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics was that permitting the
presence of an American clergyman
in Moscow.”

After the A.L.P, conference in N.S.W.
concluded the stage seemed to be set for
a contest with the Communists whether
the squibs in Canberra like it or not. The
story of months past shows how aware
some union executives are of the enemy
in their midst, and the dismay with which
they observe the indifference of the poli-
tical “Labor” party, the organism they
created and hitherto have maintained
with a loyalty the envy of all others.
The “Labor” politicals’ disposition has
been, so far, to lift no finger against the
infiltration of the Communist wreckers.
In April, Ministers, with acquiescence of
Caucus, refused even to inquire into the
Communist menace on behalf of the
unions, and Caucus resolved that it was a
matter for the unions themselves.
By overwhelming vote the squibs had
it. Or so it seemed to them. But at the
next A.L.P. inter-State conference, in
September, they may discover their
error. At that meeting the Queensland
party executive, it is announced, will
move that the Communist party be
banned as subversive and all Communists
be barred from Government employment.
The Sydney A.L.P. conference the other
day made some half-hearted effort to
satisfy a number of disgusted branches,
while not actually breaking with the Com-
munists —a move greeted by the Corns
with the threat to sever important unions
from the A.L.P. altogether, funds and
all. The Sydney-conference attitude was
just not quite so craven as the Victorian
conference at Easter; it had to keep one
eye on the N.S.W. industrial groups which
choose to interpret the antirCommuniSt
campaign seriously.
But the politicals, and above all
“ ‘Labor’s’ great leader,” Mr. Chifley, are
beneath contempt. They are without
principle in interpreting “mandates”
from the electorate, without standards in
public administration, and without
courage to meet Communist inroads
which authoritative union spokesmen
have for months been condemning as
traitorous and aimed at the disruption
of democratic society.
The chief squib, Mr. Chifley himself,
actually went to the Sydney A.L.P. con-
ference at which the Communist
menace was billed to be the chief issue—
and said not one word about the
treacherous force aiming to destroy the
unions. He ignored it. He had much to
say in his dismal-Jimmy style about “sad
memories,” present inflation (largely his
own work), and shortages in industrial
goods, though he will contribute nothing
to make increased production possible by
the means at his own command —the eas-
ing of t taxation imposts which are
throttling the community like a gar-
rotter’s cord. Herein particularly he is
Communism’s most “philosophic” ally,
and in general also he is faithfully imitat-
ing those Socialist leaders in Europe who
are first the Communists’ docile collabora-
tors and then their victims.
The squibbing in Canberra apparently
aims at avoiding a split in “the move-
ment.” How does it look to the govern-
ing body of “Labor” which supports this
leader? If its frantic talk and its paralysis
in action are any guide, it must in all
States be judged desperate. Last year
the A.L.P. executive and the Chifleyites
evolved and set up the “A.L.P. industrial
groups” to combat Communists in the
debilitated unions. The Communists did
not like this development: at the Vic-
torian A.L.P. conference last Easter a
showdown was offered.
The conference carried a recommenda-
tion declaring that Communists, directed by
the Russian Communist party, were com-
mitted to the destruction of the A.L.P.
as a prelude to social disorder and the
seizure of •political power by revolution.
That is quite true, and is fully supported
by the N.Z, Labor Government, whose
leading Ministers are undertaking a
“crusade,” in the words of their Prime
Minister, to drum Communist bosses out
of the unions. But the Victorian con-
ference only went into uproar when
spokesmen for the Tramway Union
(obedient henchmen of Communist
Brown in the late Victorian transport
strike) demanded abolition of the indus-
trial groups and lost by 185 votes to 65.
The Loco.-engineers’ spokesman indi-
cated his measure of the meeting’s in-
telligence with the following:
Communist leaders are honest and sincere.
They are endeavoring to get peace in in-
dustry. There is room inside the Labor
party for all shades of opinion, including
the Communist party.
Outside the conference his union joined
with the other two engineering unions, the
trammies, gasworkers and several more,
in promptly threatening to disaffiliate
from the A.L.P. on the Communist issue,
and to form a new “trade-union political
wing” of their own. The F.E.D.F.A.
boss said his union had refused to pay
A.L.P. dues for the past quarter, that
the A.L.P. “had forgotten that unions
contribute about £4OOO yearly to the
A.L.P., whose branches subscribe £4OO
only,” and that “trade-unions had the
means to make or break politicians.”
Whereon the Victorian conference
climbed down. It reversed its previous
“determined” stand and agreed to
“eliminate the penalty of expulsion for
members who endorsed opposed indus-
trial-group candidates in union elections.”
In plain language—“ Don’t walk out, and
we’ll let you walk in.” Among those in
the “determined” stand at pre-conference
discussions were Messrs. Calwell and
Cameron of the Chifley Squib “Govern-
ment,” Clarey of the chameleon A.C.T.U.,
and Cain, leader of the defeated Vic-
torian “Labor” Ministry.
In the week-end after Easter the annual
conference of the industrial groups was
held in Sydney. It
Urged the Federal and State “Labor”
Governments to inquire into activities pf
the Communist party. [Nothing done; said
Governments even rejected motions by
Opposition parties in Federal 'and State
Parliaments to hold such inquiries.]
Declared the Communist party aimed to
overthrow by arms if necessary Australian
democratic government [N.Z. Ministers are
campaigning on the same slogan], and that
Communism was “the greatest menace
‘Labor’ had ever encountered.” (Junor,
president.)
Mr. Junor added: “If the Communists
are allowed to get away with their plans,
our ‘Labor’ Governments will fall,”
Simultaneously Communist Lockwood in
the Sydney Domain said: “A few more
‘defeats’ like the Queensland strike and
we will be masters of Australia.”
Still not a cheep out of the Chifley
brood. The only Federal member game
to speak up was Mr. Rowley James.
The rest of the Canberra mob, solemnly-
debating in pre-sessional Caucus whether
anything should be done, decided “almost
unanimously” to reject a motion for in-
vestigation of subversive groups,
Sydney A.L.P. conference, viewing a re-
peat performance of the Communist tac-
tics used in Melbourne at Easter, also de-
clined to endorse any “outlawing” of the
Communists, though by an “overwhelm-
ing” vote it carried a resolution dissociat-
ing the Communists from the “Labor”
party, appealing for increased assistance
“by the movement” for the industrial
groups and recommending that the execu-
tive prepare and issue a report on the poli-
cies of the Communist party in Australia,
This resolution represented the lowest
common denominator of 42 branch
resolutions submitted, including some de-
manding the banning of the Communist
party as treasonable. The Ironworkers
and 8.W.1.U. representatives walked out
of the conference, like Gromyko out of
U.N.0., and their published threats to
form a breakaway political bloc, appar-
ently intending to call itself “Left-wing
Labor,” are now due to be made good.
The Victorian split being thus ex-
tended, perhaps Mr. Ward, who is still
Minister for External Territories, will
be available as political leader.
"Labor" Punters.
It is told of a "Labor” politician of some
eminence that he was a bookmaker
before he entered public life and has
since acquired a share in a “book” com-
piled by a person who bets in a big way.
The story is incredible, though not
because “Labor” has any conscientious
or other objection to bookmakers as such.
On the other side of the Tasman the
“business or occupation” was made un-
lawful in 1920. A Judge-headed com-
mission of inquiry appointed by the
Fraser Administration, itself “Labor,”
recently reported strongly against licens-
ing it “in any form,” remarking inci-
dentally that wagering on credit meant
“excessive betting, poverty and pecula-
tion” and that it was “unjustifiable and
wrong” for the P.M.G.’s Department to
place its “amenities,” particularly tele-
phones, at the service of bookmakers and
their agents and no questions asked.
Australian “Labor” has other views,
and so have Australian newspapers and
radio-stations. To all these estates of the
Commonwealth the bookmaker is an
estimable public character and his “busi-
ness or occupation” worthy of all assist-
ance. It is inconceivable that any of them
would set up or call for the setting-up of a
counterpart of the N.Z. commission or
analyse “charts,” as did the commission,
and pronounce the odds offered “clearly
favorable to the bookmaker and unfavor-
able to the client”; in one case
“ludicrously low.” Nor would any of
them find words of praise for the magis-
terial policy laid down for bookmakers in
New Zealand as a result of what the com-
mission of inquiry brought out:
For a first offence: Admitted 'to pro-
bation for 12 months, with a condition that
the offender shall not go on or near a
racecourse during that period, and shall
take employment as directed by the pro-
bation officer.
For a second offence, imprisonment.
The politician-bookmaker tale is im-
probable for other reasons. If it were
true the gentleman in the dual role would
be marked down for patronage by other
“Labor” politicians and worthies, and
the result would be disastrous. These
others can be seen in droves at Rand-
wick and on the courses gathered in by
the Sydney Turf Club, that monument
to Mr. McKell, the royal prince’s suc-
cessor as Governor-General, raised during
the Japanese war to strike terror into the
enemy’s heart. There they mingle with
new aristocrats of the racing world, who
are dressed in the best that dollars can
buy. Got up in elegant suits, cut in
the latest American style; high-crowned,
wide-brimmed hats with gaudy bands,
here and there brilliantly feathered ; ties
matching the hatbands, and as startling,
and two-toned shoes With frills, the
general effect being heightened by large
gold tie-keepers and key-chains. The
“Labor” section is cased in humbler habili-
ments and accessories, though not always,
but the history of “Labor” punters spells
blue ruin for bookmakers.
In the argot of the turf, our putative
bookmaker-politician would be a mug to
stand up at Randwick or Rosehill, in
person or by deputy, when Bill Urquhart
was going into the Ring with his head
down. Bill Urquhart, Mr. Ward’s
protegd and pal, his National Service
Officer at Newtown, his nominee for the
£2OOO-a-year job at Pincombes (applica-
tion for a typewriter import licence
granted), his go-between with constituents
(hire-cars charged up to the people) and
his favored guest —“I used to go to Mr.
Ward’s house Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays on electoral work.” Bill Urqu-
hart of the private safe, the six bank
accounts, through one of which £29,000
passed in two years (“I used to withdraw
£5OO on a Friday,” take it out to the
races and “bank on a Monday”), and
of the spectacular wins on the horse
Precise, in one of which Mrs. Ward
shared.
Bill Urquhart “bet in hundreds in the
Leger and on the Flat” —yes, on the Flat,
where the A.J.C. rule is that “a book-
maker shall be compelled to lay the odds
to not less than one pound, but shall not
be compelled to lose more than £2O on
any straightout wager.” What havoc
Bill must have wrought among those un-
happy Flat bookmakers! What “Labor”
politician with a share in a “bag” could
hope to survive the assaults of this
Demon Punter and others of the breed,
such as “Mossie” Hyam (now with God),
also “a friend?’ of Mr. Ward! It would
be financial suicide.
Further back there was that other Bill—
Bill Mahony, “Labor” M.H.R. for Dailey,
Sydney. Moved, he said, by admiration
for the talents of Mr. Theodore and by
disgust at Queensland’s scurvy reluctance
to reward them with a Federal seat, Bill
Mahony gave up his own seat to his hero.
A great sacrifice, for Bill had been
member for 12 years, and, being an
amiable character, could look forward to
being member till the end of his days;
and Parliament was his only known
source of income.
The usual “Tory” was on hand with
the malignant tale that money, £5OOO or
so, had passed, and, a “Tory” Govern-
ment being in office, the thing went to
an inquiry by a Judge. Bill assured his
Honor that he had been actuated by
pure magnanimity and had been enabled
to indulge it by winning a fortune on the
Melbourne Cup, part of which fortune
he consigned to a safe-deposit box —
quite a 1948 touch. Names of book-
makers and specific amounts collected
from each? Bill couldn’t remember. In
the words of a contemporary chronicler,
“the Judge decided that the money had
passed as alleged, and for the purpose
alleged, and that the explanation offered
amounted to an insult thrown at the
human intelligence.”
Further back still there was the case
of Father Shaw, Jens Jensen (“Labor”
Minister for the Navy) and “Labor”
Senator Jim Long. Father Shaw was
head of a wireless company, and, on
Jensen’s recommendation, the Govern-
mertt bought him out for £55,000, which
was paid to his credit at a Melbourne
bank. That day he drew £5200 in “notes
of large denomination,” went straight
to Parliament House and handed “a rofi”
to Senator Long, saying “Jim, I don’t
know what I owe you, but this ought to
clear it.” Three years later, when the
facts of the “very calamitous transac-
tion” (Navy Commission) came out. Long
said the “roll” added up to £1290, £3OO
of which was in repayment of a loan an
the rest “a sort of mark of esteem o
sign of friendship.” Going out to t e
races and winning another £llOO frofjj
unremembered bookmakers—like Bill
Mahony in the next decade Jim was to
dumb forgetfulness a prey —he paid
£2400 into his account in a Melbourne
bank. In those days public opinion was
a real thing and the now-discarded
notion that Ministers and members must
be above suspicion still prevailed. So
Jensen was summarily dismissed and
within a few days Long had resigned.
In between there was the case in which
Maling, acting-g.m. of Sydney’s muni-
cipal electricity department, was sent to
jail after a royal commissioner. Judge
Harvey, had declared him guilty of extort-
ing £10,600 from tenderers for a-power-
raising plant at Bunnerong, a name of
moody significance to all the customers,
and sharing the spoil with “Labor”
aldermen. One of the witnesses at this
inquiry was a former power-station super-
intendent, who obligingly confessed to
having received tainted coal-money for
years, sharing with Maling at times and,
on one occasion, with two “Labor”
aldermen and Ms.L.A., Stokes and Holds-
worth, both noted punters. Another
witness was Alderman Mick Burke,
M.L.A., who, denying that he had shared
in the Maling loot, attributed part of his
possessions to spectacular successes on the
racecourse. “That’s the game,” he said
to the Judge, who did not seem impressed.
Over the years there have been other
contributions to the history of “Labor”
achievements in the punting line, but the
foregoing will suffice for the present. The
moral is plain. Any “Labor” politician
who goes into the “business or occupa-
tion” of bookmaker, whether as principal
or sleeping partner, should get his head
read.
Misery and Mercy.
This year Australia will contribute
£1,000,000 to the International Children’s
Emergency Fund, the purpose of which
is to buy food for undernourished chil-
dren in distressed countries. That sum
is this country’s official contribution, but
an appeal is shortly to be launched for
individual gifts from private donors, part
of a world-wide effort to augment the
funds voted by member-countries of the
United Nations.
Writing in Hulton’s “Picture Post,”
which devoted a whole issue to the cause,
Chester Bowles, chairman of the Advisory
Committee of U.N. Appeal for Children,
pointed out that from 1943 to 1946
U.N.R.R.A. shipped $5,000,000,000-
worth of food, clothing,- medicine
and machinery for relief purposes and
that the sudden ending of U.N.R.R.A.
left a gap, to fill which the Children’s
Emergency Fund was established.
Donations from Governments and in-
dividuals fell far short of what had been
originally hoped for, and Mr. Aake
Ording, Norwegian delegate to U.N.0.,
made a proposal which is the basis of
the present scheme:
He proposed that all the peoples of the
world act as good neighbors, through the
United Nations. He asked that everyone
in the world give one day of his time,
energy or money for the benefit of children.
Between 40 ‘and 50 nations are ex-
pected to co-operate in the scheme. Ice-
land, one of the smallest countries, has
already raised £lOO,OOO, almost £1 a
head of the population; Britain, itself
harassed by shortages, is aiming at a big
target. The job is a gigantic one, in-
volving the fate of tens of millions of
youngsters in Europe. In Austria, for
instance, with a population swollen by
an influx of displaced persons from
Eastern Europe, school meals are pro-
vided for 400,000 children. For most
of them this meal is the staple one of
the day; it consists of horsemeat and
soup one day in five —on the other days
the menu is bread and lard or some kind
of gruel. Skim-milk is provided with all
meals. Even this meagre diet is made
possible only through the emergency
fund.
The devastation of farmlands in Europe
and the destruction of herds —Europe’s
milk production is down to not much
more than half the pre-war level—have
already meant starvation for millions,
and tuberculosis and other diseases aggra-
vated by malnutrition threaten millions
more. In the long run Europe’s agricul-
tural lands, with their remarkable recu-
perative powers, will recover from this
as from other disasters, but the problem
of the children is not a long-term one;
the need is pressing and immediate, and
the time for action is now.
The Australian committee of the fund
will be launching its appeal within a
week or so. Briefly the intention is to
ask everyone to donate one day’s pay
or its equivalent in service to the Chil-
dren’s Fund. Business-houses will be
asked to organise collections on behalf
of their staffs. The cause is one which
should appeal to everyone with any
human feelings.


PLATN ENGLISH
Communis Plots in Asia.
In contrast with Canberra’s professed
support of the British Empire and of
British influence in the sub-Asian waters
—vital enough surely to Australia —the
complete indifference of the Chifley Gov-
ernment to the activities in Malaya of
the Australian Communist-party boss,
Sharkey, is becoming scandalous, if not
actually hostile to British policy.
Even from a narrow Australian point
of view, that Communist agents in Aus-
tralia (Sharkey is only the latest of them)
should be allowed to go abroad to assist
in stirring up revolution and racial pas-
sions in countries immediately north of
the Commonwealth portends grave
trouble in the future for this country.
Taking the broader view, Malaya is a
vital source of dollars for Britain and of
other resources essential to the rehabili-
tation of Western Europe.
The Communist-inspired violence now
threatening to submerge Malaya in a
wave of terrorism, murder and looting
has reached a stage where the U.K.
High Commissioner in Malaya has de-
clared a general state of emergency and
sought from the British Government
“authority to banish agitators who are
British subjects.” It is to be hoped that
he will quickly grab Comrade Sharkey,
whose latest effusion in the local Com-
munist organ, as quoted by Mr. Lang in
the House of Reps., is:
What has to be struck down in Malaya
is not, as that Imperialist dog, Malcolm
MacDonald, declares, the Malayan Com-
munist party, but brutal British Imperialism.
Mr. Malcolm MacDonald is British Com-
missioner-General in S.-E. Asia, and the
Malayan Communist party is one of the
agencies of the “Cominform” head-
quarters in Bangkok, which is stirring up
violence through Chinese and other Com-
munist gangs to disrupt the new self-
governing Administrations everywhere in
S.-E. Asia and to destroy the industries
on which those countries —and the
Western democracies—depend.
From Burma to the Philippines' this
Communist plot is being closely followed.
At present attacks on Europeans are tak-
ing place chiefly in Malaya, where several
British planters have been murdered.
Yet into this scene of revolutionary law-
lessness the Australian Government has
permitted a notorious Australian Com-
munist firebrand to intrude himself,
travelling on a Government passport and
(if earlier precedents were followed) with
some Government assistance in priority
as to means of transport. The Govern-
ment has even a “goodwill mission” of
its own, that of Mr. Macmahon Ball,
walking about this political earthquake-
area with splay-feet.
The latest Malayan press files to hand
republish a broadcast by Mr. MacDonald
announcing reasons why the Administra-
tion has proclaimed a state of emergency
in Malaya:
Communist agitators are making a des-
perate effort to impose the rule of gun
and knife in plantations, mines and fac-
tories They are opposing the new
national Governments in both India and
Burma. They do not want Indian and
Burmese national freedom to be a success.
They want to create economic and political
distress for their own ends.
There is no doubt about the organising
of this trouble from Moscow, and Mos-
cow’s agents in Australia have been
treacherously carrying out Moscow’s sub-
versive policy among Asian peoples ever
since J. S. Garden organised the Pan-
Pacific Secretariat in this country on his
return from Soviet Russia in 1927. But
to Mr. Chifley this is merely their
“philosophy.”
"Sports for Ever"!
In 1943, during the period when Mr.
Ward was suspended from his office.
Labor and National Service, by Mr.
Curtin, which office he never regained.
Liaison-officer Garden threw his weight
about in a Sydney war factory.
There had been a strike, and women
who were doing munitions work from
patriotic motives refused to “settle” it by
joining the union. This was not to the
liaison officer’s taste, and, trying to in-
timidate a K.C.’s wife, he thundered “If
you want war effort, Mrs. Cassidy, I’ll put
you where you can get plenty, up to your
neck in dirt.” The Bulletin came out
with a cartoon of Garden shaking his fist
and shouting “I’ll fight any woman in
the place!” It has thoughts of republish-
ing the cartoon, with another face and
form substituted, for the spirit which
moved Garden has survived his dismissal
and retirement to a Crown establishment
in which there are many officers, though
none of the liaison variety.
Of this spirit there is an accumulation
of evidence. The worst examples are the
deportation orders served on friendless
creatures such as the Chinese wife of a
white resident and the Tongan wife of
another; but there have been others
almost as bad. The girls working for the
Americans in' Guam and Manna were
ordered to return at once and convert
their dollar savings into Australian cur-
rency. Dollars —Keane had plenty and
his “very dear friend” Goldberg must
have spent stacks of them on his trips to
America—were refused, at least in the
first instance, to “Miss Australia.” And
this report from Adelaide went the rounds
of the papers last week:
Miss Patricia Howard, a Port Augusta
(S.A.) singer, won a Victorian radio net-
work’s Professional and Amateur Parade.
The prize was originally to be £2OO cash and
a trip to America. Because of dollar re-
strictions, the American trip could not be
arranged, so the sponsors decided to give
her another £5OO.
Reducing the thing to the lowest
materialist level, a girl with a beautiful
voice would be an excellent advertisement
for Australia in the United States, and
it would be greatly to her advantage to
go there. She might become as famous
on the American concert platform as that
other South Australian Judith Anderson
has become in the American theatre;
Miss Anderson has been hailed by the
critics as the most accomplished actress
on the New York stage. But Miss
Howard is not to have the opportunity.
Being of the wrong sex and calling, she
has been deprived of a privilege never
known to be refused to “sports,” the
latest being a Sydney jockey. ■
The jockey set out for the U.S.A. a few
days before finis was written to Miss
Howard’s ambitions in that direction. He
and his travels were the theme of effu-
sive newspaper articles, with photographs,
and one of the latter—subject, a farewell
gathering in which “the bubbly was
was turned on,” and there figured a
a pugilist who periodically announces his
intention of going to the U.S.A., as if
there were no impediments, and an
American, here on business connected
with John Wren’s Stadium, to which he
consigns crates of American bruisers —
was spread over three columns. And Mr.
W. J. (“Knockout”) Smith was quoted as
saying that the jockey carried his “recom-
mendations,” and “letters of introduction,”
and that he hoped the youth would ride
a horse he had sold to a Californian.
Mr. W. J. (“Knockout”) Smith is a
great figure in the manufacturing as well
as the racing world. His politics are his
own business, but he was concerned in
a transaction which “Labor” remembers
with satisfaction and gratitude. For,
when negotiating a motor-vehicle-con-
struction contract which never came to
anything except compensation, paid in
“Labor’s” time, didn’t he lease a horse to
Mr. Lawson, then the “Tory” Minister
of Customs, and didn’t “Labor” make the
lease an issue at the Corio by-election,
and didn’t it bring in the oft-defeated
Mr, Dedman? And didn’t the affair wreck
Lawson’s career, and, when the too-
enthusiastic lessee was down and out —
his portfolio gone, his seat about to be
lost-—didn’t Mr. Ward, in a fit of out-
raged virtue, denounce him and roar for
an inquiry? Yes, to all.
An American visit for a jockey and
for shoals of other “sports” as well as
Goldberg, who is something of a punter.
None for a girl with a lovely voice. So
does “Labor,” in the terms of its old
“objective,” promote “the cultivation of
an enlightened and self-reliant com-'
munity.”
Was Hanlon Bluffed?
The Hanlon decision to repeal the
Queensland anti-picketing law, and the
inference behind it that Hanlon Labor is
just as obedient to union demands as
Canberra and Sydney “Labor,” was a
shock to the Queensland sugar industry,
already facing terrific problems and wide
open to attack by Communists, who
regard the Sugar Coast as a strategic area
in their war on the Australian democratic
system.
At the beginning of the present cane
season the storage space of mills and
ports was choked with 140,000 tons of
1947 sugar; the crop now being cut is
estimated at 635,000 tons, which means
that 775,000 tons will have to be moved
from N.Q. this season. Every method
possible is being tried to shift it —from
efforts to get ships away in decent time
to appeals for special rail-transport—but
the real achievement is small, and the
reason need be sought no further than
in the comparative loading-rates for ships,
produced by E. T. Pearce, Australian
Sugar Producers’ Association secretary:
Tons Loaded per Hour per Gang.
Port. 1939. 1947. Reduction.
Cairns .. .. 25.0 15.1 40 p.c.
Lucinda Pt. .. 37.0 24.0 35 „
Townsville .. 23.7 13.2 44 „
Bowen .. .. 22.1 14.6 34 „
Mackay .. .. 18.3 16.3 11 „
From 1936 to 1939 an average of 589,000 tons
was shipped from N.Q. ports in the six months
July-Decemtfer. Under present conditions the
comparative tonnage for 1948 will be 385,000
tons.
This is bad enough, but “Courier-Mail”
was able to say on June 9;
Knowledge of Communist plans to dis-
rupt the North Queensland sugar industry
next month also played a major part in the
Cabinet’s decision [to repeal the anti-picket-
ing law]. Under the plan directed against
the anti-picketing law, waterside workers
were to refuse to load sugar, farmers would
then have been given permission to load it
and that would have brought the seamen
out and tied up all Australian shipping.
What the sugar people want to know
is whether this threat was held over
Hanlon and bluffed him into repeal of
the Act. If it did, the Premier can hope
for no rest. It has been demonstrated
repeatedly that “appeasement” gets no-
where with Communist-led unions, and,
having given in on this point, Hanlon
will find himself faced with similar threats
on others. The only way to deal with
Communists is to enforce the law to the
limit. Meantime, the sugar problem is a
bigger headache than ever.
The Country Policeman.
Usually an unassuming sort of chap, he
paces round the streets or stands quietly
at the back of the hall during the hos-
pital benefit concert. He seems slightly
embarrassed in the local court when
people he knows are fined for drinking
after hours, failure to destroy rabbits or
driving without a tail-light. Sometimes he
makes a leisurely tour of the district on
a motor-bike, gathering statistics and
drinking tea at farmsteads; he attends
race-meetings, fires, political meetings and
keeps order at the local picture-show.
When the occasion demands it he
wraps up the remains of suicides and
fatal accidents, carries bad news, searches
for lost children, drops hints in the right
quarters about “wayward” girls, elimi-
nates diseased animals, raids the s.-p.
shop, picks up drunks, falls upon roughs
or is fallen upon by roughs, lectures
schoolchildren on road safety, calms
minor panics, nabs an occasional house-
breaker, protects football referees, sees
that nobody drives a horse with sore
shoulders, rescues kittens, watches the
trains go out, polices the game laws' and
manages to shave regularly and present
an unruffled appearance.
When disaster on a large scale hits
the district —as happened last week when
the N.S.W. North Coast suffered vast
floods —he is the refuge and the strength
of the stricken. Every report from the
North Coast mentions him —“Police
rescued two families last night”—“Con-
stable So-and-So swam the flooded
road”—“Sergeant Johnhop and a con-
stable found the marooned family”—
“Police took food and clothing”—
“Police sent warnings”—“At grave risk
police went out last night”—and so on.
The words give a bare outline of hours
of hard work, anxiety and peril, rowing
over tumbling waters in the rainy dark,
searching for the missing, answering calls
for help, comforting the distressed,
organising rescue and relief, ready to drop
with fatigue but somehow finding extra
strength to go out again.
It is the same when bushfires sweep
the land, a demented man with a gun
breaks loose, an epidemic cripples the
district or a cyclone levels a town—
always at the head of the fighters, looked
upon as a leader, depended upon in the
crisis, is the quiet cove who in normal
hours stands at the back of the hall or
paces sedately through the streets. It’s
all in the line of duty, and when the
crisis is past, as the North Coast will
shortly discover once again, he will re-
appear, shaven and unruffled, as though
the flood hadn t happened, and in no way
suggesting that dozens now living might
have died but for him.
Awkward Coincidence.
Nature made the N.S.W. North Coast
one of the fairest and best-watered
regions in the world, and it is immensely
productive withal. But man, the political
being, has done little or nothing to pro-
tect the inhabitants when the rivers go
i oaring to the sea in spate. So there have
been more destructive floods, bringing
danger as well as loss and suffering to
thousands of good people of all ages
and both sexes, though this time, happily,
there was no reported loss of life.
The North Coast, though eminently
fit in point of population and in every
other way to have, with the hinterland,
a State of its own, is in State matters
governed ’ from Sydney. When news
of the floods reached that city the “Gov-
ernment” wrung its hands helplessly and
then held out one towards Canberra.
After deep thought Mr. Chifley offered
to drop “up to £10,000” into the out-
stretched paw in driblets, provided the
Sydney “Government” contributed pound
for pound. The damage to homes and
property is reckoned at £250,000. Ten
thousand from Sydney, if it arrives,
would be less than a quarter’s allotment
of what members of the Sydney Assembly
awarded themselves the last time they
raised their salaries. But these politicians
are nothing if not generous—to them-
selves.
While the “Government” was fumbling
and giving the impression that it regarded
the North Coast as “foreign,” the term
it applies to lotteries competing with its
own. Dr. Page came out with an old
flood-prevention and water-conservation
idea of his, “a 230 ft.-high dam at The
Gorge, on the Upper Clarence.” A Mr.
Weir said it was a great idea, and “the
work should have been carried out many
years ago,” This Mr. Weir didn’t say
why it wasn’t, being more concerned with
“appointing committees,” those never-
faihng “Labor” substitutes for thought
and action.
Mr. Weir has been “Minister for Con-
servation” since May, 1946, the office
being four years old. A Sydney man,
of course; public servant, then barrister,
then (May, 1941) M.L.A. for the suburb
of Dulwich Hill. In fact, the ideal
‘Minister for Conservation” from the
Sydney “Labor” point of view.
Somewhat ominously for the Weirs and
McGirrs, the floods and fumbling coin-
cided with preparations, for a New-State
Convention. It is to be held at Armidale
on Friday and Saturday, and Dr. Page
will be the principal speaker. The
veteran in the cause of regional self-
government can be depended upon to
point the moral.
The Land of Living Lies.
“Ananias” communicates from the
Infernal Regions':
I join with my good friends Stalin, Molotov
and Vyshinsky and their less majestic counter-
parts in Australia in resenting the condemnation
ot me Soviet democracy” by the late Aus-
tralian Minister to Russia, Mr. J. J. Maloney,
m his book Inside Red Russia.
Maloney derides the Soviet junta for repre-
senting that “never in the history of the world
have there been such really free and democratic
elections.” Maloney was there for two years
and saw an election with his own eyes; so
what he says is probably mere filthy truth.
As such let me contrast it with this speech of
Stalins, noted in Maloney’s pages:—
The point is not that our elections will
be universal, equal, secret and direct,
though that in itself is of great importance.
The point is that they will be the freest
elections and the most democratic of any
country in the world.
And how! Is not this lying on the grand scale
m the Communists’ own Land of Lies? Admire
with me the details observed—albeit truthfully
—by Maloney:
(1) Five months’ electioneering (Oct. to Feb.)
spent in instruction of the Russian people that
“true democracy” and “consolidation of the
dictatorship” are “not contradictory terms.”
(2) lhat “all the best features of democracy
elsewhere have been transferred to Russia,” with
the result that “there can be only one party
tolerated, and that the party of Stalin.” (In
the vernacular—“ One party in power, all the
rest in jail.”)
(3) That only one candidate can stand for
election in any electorate; there can be no
opposition.
(4) A healthy political may be
induced through a purge by shooting in the
neck of selected persons before the election
begins (as in 1937-38), whereafter “99.4 per
cent, of the popular poll was for the Govern-
ment.”
(5) The only political meetings shall be those
ordered by the Government, attendance com-
pulsory; applause of read speeches to begin
when signalled by the chairman (with a press-
button light) and to stop when the light goes
out; police with truncheons to see that the
audience is properly instructed in these re-
sponses.
(6) A horde of 1,500,000 “agitators” swarm-
ing over the electorates to see that the people
understand than on election-day attendance to
vote is a duty and absence a criminal offence.
(7) On election-day every movement of every
elector closely watched. Each elector voted by
going up to an official in the polling-booth,
receiving a ballot-paper with the only can-
didate’s name on it, which he then folded and
placed in the ballot-box. If (purely theoretical)
he should wish to vote against the candidate
he would cross out the candidate’s name before
returning the ballot-paper. That would be his
last voluntary act in life.
One of the neatest produced results was that
in Stalin’s own electorate in 1937, when Stalin
received more than 100 per cent, of the regis-
tered votes cast there. That surely lifts lying
into the supreme sphere where it is no longer
conscious art, but sheer natural instinct.
For their propaganda performances in general,
and for the representation of this system as
“the freest democratic elections in the world,”
I salute the Moscow Communists and their
brothers in all lands (including Maloney’s Aus-
tralia) collectively as the worthiest competitors
I have yet known for my title, and unquestion-
ably the greatest liars yet unhung; and I
look forward eagerly to their speedy arrival
in these infernal regions. That Maloney and
great numbers of other people may cordially
share these hopes has no bearing whatever
upon the sentiments I wish to express. No
matter how many million murders of other
kinds they have committed, their supreme
recommendation with me is their accomplish-
ment as Murderers of Truth.
Black, Brown and White Coal.
While Newcastle coalminers mouth their
“concern” about “anarchy” in the
industry and at the same time push
on with schemes for a 35-hour week,
extra holidays and other claims calcu-
lated to ensure a further drop in out-
put, Governments in three States which
were at one time entirely dependent on
Newcastle for coal are steadily going
ahead with long-range plans for freeing
their industries from the intolerable posi-
tion of dependence upon the whims of
Communist-led New South Wales miners
for their fuel.
Queensland, already more than half-
free, seems likely, with the help of British
capital and technical skill, to go even
further and build up an export trade per-
haps comparable with the one New South
Wales once held, Victoria, formerly

Newcastle’s biggest customer, now draws
most of its electricity-supply from brown-
coal deposits at Yallourn, and plans to
exploit her vast reserves on a much
bigger scale. German technicians have
been consulted, and permission has been
granted to import mining machinery from
Germany, whose pre-war production of
brown coal was in the vicinity of
200,000,000 tons a year. As a temporary
measure Victoria plans to import coal
from South Africa.
South Australia, poorest of all the
States where coal deposits are concerned,
under pressure of chronic strike-produced
shortages, entailing frequent application
of gas- and power-rationing and the ever-
present threat of total stoppage of sup-
plies, has developed Leigh Creek coal-
field —a deposit which, if economic factors
were the sole determinant, would have re-
mained unscratched for decades. Latest
plan of the S.A. Electrical Trust provides
for the construction of a power-station at
Port Augusta, at the head of Spencer Gulf,
from which power will be provided, to sup-
plement the Adelaide system and to
serve places as far distant as the Renmark
irrigation areas.
The plant will be a £5,000,000
job; work is scheduled to begin
soon, and the whole scheme will be in
operation by 1952. Three sites were con-
sidered for the power-station—Osbome
(near Port Adelaide), Port Pirie and Port
Augusta. Osborne would have meant a
much smaller capital outlay (£3,625,000),
but it was considered that the difference
in transport charges on the 400,000 tons
of Leigh Creek coal required annually
would more than offset the initial saving.
Difference in the cost of transport also
disqualified the Port Pirie site, despite the
fact that the Pirie smelters will be a big
customer for the power. In other words,
it is cheaper to transmit power than to
transport coal. A similar belief is im-
plicit in the recommendation of German
experts for the establishment of a big
gas plant at Port Augusta and the build-
ing of pipelines to Adelaide. There
should be a lesson in all this for the
Newcastle miners, but they’re not likely
to heed it while their Communist leaders
feed them the old story that they can
hold Australian industry up to ransom
whenever they feel inclined.
POLITICAL POINTS
After doing little and trying to hide a
lot (ineffectually, for smells can’t be
screened). Federal “Labor” has shut up
the Parliamentary shop, and the half-
timers (House) and quarter-timers
(Senate) are dispersing in all directions.
Chifley, Evatt and Armstrong, if not
other Ministers, are off to England,
whither also Rosevear and a party of
six are bound —in their case for a very
convenient Empire Parliamentary Associ-
ation conference. Another party of six
is going to Japan and a third party of
five to Queensland “at the invitation of
the Hanlon Government.” Taxpayers
are unable to see that a show from which
so many Ministers and members can be
spared for long periods needs 47 more
Ms.H.R. and 24 more Senators, but
Chifley and Evatt swear it does and have
legislated accordingly—// they can get
away with the legislation, which is doubt-
ful.
The politicians off to Japan are to be
“led” by Haylen, who has already had
one trip abroad. A billsticker who can
hold his tongue —Haylen can’t—would
be a better selection.
Archie Cameron, in an end-of-session
speech on foreign affairs —never debated
except at the end of a session:
The world is preparing again for the
westward march of men like Attila and
Genghis Khan, who this time will march
under the hammer-and-sickje.
And towards the same objective—loot.
The Premiers are at Canberra to dis-
cuss transfer of prices and rent “controls”
with Chifley. On one thing they seem to
be agreed already, irrespective of party
—they will let prawns, birdseed and
luxury goods go back to a free market.
So serious is the coal shortage in Vic-
toria and the starvation of the railways
there that the Hollway Government, in
addition to a string of emergency mea-
sures, has ordered 18 electric locomotives,
at a cost of £1,500,000, to replace coal-
burners. It couldn’t wait for Ward’s
uniform-gauge plan, designed, Ward said,
to avoid expense in replacing broad-gauge
rolling-stock. The plight to which Vic-
toria and South Australia, the best of the
few remaining customers, have been re-
duced is a dreadful commentary on
union-larrikinism with a Communist
twist and “Labor” paternalism, of which
poltroonery is an ingredient; but the
Ward theory is all N.S.W, coal strikes
and go-slow pranks are of “capitalist
origin.”
Adelaide is a city of more than 300,000
people, most of them law-abiding, honest
and decent. Yet to such a pass have
they been reduced by what passes for
industrial law and by the coddled N.S.W.
coalminers that their city would have
been gasless, and partly lightless, but for
a fortuitous fire. It broke out on a ship
carrying coal from India to N.Z, and
forced the unloading of 2500 tons.
Death has come to W. J. Brooker, the
Tommy soldier who became a Tasmanian
“Labor” politician and rose to be Cos-
grove’s deputy, and his stopgap last sum-
mer when the Premier had pressing
private business on hand. Brooker was
one of the Franklin group of Assembly-
men, and in view of the situation in the
Speek there ought to be a by-election,
but under Proportional Representation
there can’t be. It is P.R.’s fatal defect.
In a report on the N.S.W. A.L.P.
conference headed “A.L.P. Avoided Fight
on Communists,” a Sydney “Morning
Herald” reporter presented the views of
“active non-Communist union officials ’
on the Chief Avoider:
They say that if the P.M. had invited
the conference to take off the gloves to
Communists the decision of the gathering
would have been very different.
But, although “the Communist question
was the liveliest subject listed for discus-
sion at the conference,” the P.M- “avoided
any reference to it.”
In “avoiding” any reference to the
Communist conspiracy, Chifley was con-
sistent in his ignominious way. After
the successful general election in the
spring of 1943, he attended a meeting of
his Macquarie A.L.P. Assembly, and in
silence heard Reds order “the Common-
wealth Parliament” to “make it clear to
Mr. Churchill that the people of Aus-
tralia feel involved in the disgrace that
the British Cabinet has incurred through
its failure to relieve the intolerable burden
borne by the Russians.” By the Rus-
sians, who, with four times the popula-
tion of Britain, had been in one war on
their own dunghill since June, 1941,
whereas Britain had been in one war
since September, 1939, in two wars on
two continents since June, 1940, and in
three wars, on three continents, since
December, 1941. Chifley’s only recorded
utterance was “It is pleasing to see. that
the Macquarie A.L.P. Assembly is be-
coming more representative.”
One of McGirr’s Cahills (there are
two) has the job in front of him of
forcing people to vote in municipal elec-
tions. About 8000 “failed” to do it in
two widely-separated by-elections, one in
Albury and the other in Woollahra, and
in the river town “a surprising number of
reputable male citizens, some with wit-
nesses, declared that they could not vote
because of approaching maternity.”
These country chaps have theit own
sense of humor.
It’s a land of paradoxes. The same
rain which brought floods and a quarter-
million damage to the N.S.W. North
Coast brought relief to, drought-stricken
central and south-west Queensland and
gave the new wheat crops in eastern Aus-
tralia a great start.
Sheahan, the McGirr Lands Minister,
was doing a good job for soldier-settle-
ment until his “Labor” prejudices drove
him to announce that the winning of a
block in a ballot by a Falkiner suggested
a “grave scandal”:
Inquiries have shown that Mr. Falkiner
holds 40 shares of £lOOO each in F. ( S.
Falkiner and Sons.' I am considering an
appeal to the Land and Valuation Court
on the eligibility of the applicant.
Shares in the company didn’t stop Falk-
iner from fighting for his country. He
did that under a volunteer system, and
he is as much entitled to the benefits of
the soldier-settlement scheme as any other
returned soldier. Mr. Sheahan, himself
an Old Digger and one of a family of
landholders in the Gundagai district,
should know that perfectly well.
Essingtpn Lewis, B.H.P.’s g.m., de-
livered thP Fisher lecture in Commerce at
Adelaide University. Acknowledging
the Vice-Chancellor’s reference to his
services as Director-General of Munitions,
he said, “I worked first with Mr. Lyons ;
then with and for Mr. Menzies at the
outbreak of war; then with and for Mr.
Curtin; since then I have worked for
Mr. Chifley.” So boisterous was the
laughter after the last sentence that it was
a minute or so before the lecturer could
go on.
Dr. Evatt has discovered that “there are
extremist forces in Malaya, ready to
seize on any weapon to discourage co-
operation in trade and other matters in
Australia.” A whale of an understate-
ment, for “in trade and other matters”
“the extremist forces” are working in
conjunction with the “extremist forces”
which, “Labor” abjectly yielding, have
blasted Australia’s relations with the
Dutch East Indies since September, 1945 ;
and they are going further —murdering
rubber planters at a great rate as part of
a world-wide movement to deprive the
Western democracies of rubber (not only
the raw but the finished product) should
the Workers’ Paradise attack them. All
Communists, of course, and nearly all
Chinese, and in 1942 Sydney “extremists”
were fond of alleging that they could
have whipped the Japs in Malaya and
prevented the taking of Singapore, only
the effete British wouldn’t employ them.
This stuff appeared not only in the Com-
munist rags licensed by “Labor,” but in
a credulous section of the “Tory” press.
Harrison, leading in place of Menzies,
had to apologise to “four men whom 1
described as Communists.” Lang made
a much better fist of the business when
his turn came round. Serving up a
blistering roster to Dedman, he chal-
lenged that worthy to explain his clumsy
admission that there were Communists
in his department, and his clumsier plea
that “the great majority of them hold posi-
tions which they could not possibly use to
betray defence secrets.” Dedman tried
to brazen it out and failed egregiously.
In Portland, Oregon, last month two
of the Republicans seeking the party
nomination for President engaged in de-
bate on the Communist conspiracy.
Stassen, arguing against Dewey and main-
taining that, as a conspiracy, it should be
outlawed in all free countries, made the
point that “more than a fourth of the
country’s Communists operate in New
York,” which, country districts included,
has an eleventh of the U.S. population.
The Governor of New York did not deny
the charge. In Australia at least 80 p.c. of
the Communists hang out in five cities,
and 98 p.c. of the mischief done by Com-
munists is plotted and directed from
these cities. It has been proved in the
U.S.A. that small States are checks on the
nefarious operations of the* breed; and
there would be more checks in Australia
if there were more States.
It’s a pity lan Hamilton was not spared
to see the uncanny dual fulfilment of his
prophecy, written in 1923:
When Masaryk goes west Benes won’t
last long—nor Czechoslovakia either.
Benes has fallen again, this time without
hope of resurrection. And Czechoslo-
vakia, having expelled its 3,000,000
Sudetenlanders, who hated joining it —
they wanted to remain in Austria —has
become a Russian police State. By one
of the terrible ironies of history, Czechs
bolting from the Communist despotism,
as many have done, have had to take
refuge among Germans the Benes regime
ran out of their country with little more
than they stood up in.
It has been written of the U.S. income-
tax law passed over the President’s veto
that while personal exemptions, previously
$5OO, were increased to $6OO, and dated
back to January 1, a person more than 65
years of age receives an additional $6OO
exemption. In Australia bloodsucking
taxes are extorted from old people who,
after paying for many years into super-
annuation and provident funds, come out
with £3 a week and are worse off than
old-age pensioners who never saved a
shilling.
Dollars, though scarce as hens’ teeth,
are always available for International
Labor Office conferences. What good
comes of these discussions nobody knows,
but an Australian delegation was crated
to San Francisco powwows, timed for
last week. Ward, Amour and party com-
posed the last mission, so far as is known.
A Mr. Drummond, from Adelaide, leads
the latest party, and it can only be hoped
that he will stifle any inclination to light
a cigarette in the homecoming plane.
“Coal has become a political weapon,”
said Premier Hollway, and so it is with
other things. In the case of the union
ban on the Greek steamer Chelatros,
“because the Greek Government has
arrested Greek maritime union-leaders,”
it was suddenly discovered that the ship
was “under time charter to the French
Government,” and “the French dele-
gates at U.N.O. supported the Australian
delegates’ stand against deiaym dealing
with the arrested leaders. The
then lifted and the ship sailed with 9000
tons of maize beneath its hatches.
If the Singapore “Free Press,” that
lifelong pillar of British orthodoxy, is
“extremist,” so is the London limes,
but Dr. Evatt applied the term to it
after the Macßall fiasco. As it happens,
its editor, E. L. S. Jennings was in Mel-
bourne on a holiday with his family.
“Far from being ‘extremist, he said,
“the 113-year-old ‘Free Press’ is British-
owned, and is regarded in Singapore as
conservative.”
Melbourne traffic-police ‘ favor” pro-
posed new penalties, including suspension
or cancellation of a driver s licence if
he pleads sickness or incapacity. Other
“inclusions”:
Imprisonment for driving after suspen-
sion or cancellation.
Fifty pounds or a month plus suspension
or cancellation for repeated speeding
offences.
Fifty pounds or three months for a second
failure to stop and report an accident.
Twelve months’ cancellation for drunken
driving.
Minimum age of drivers to be 18 instead
of 17.
There is no talk of bringing in a law
to protect the careful motorist against
the careless, drunken or foolish pedes-
trian.


“OUR FOREIGN POLICY.”
“Answering Mr. Harrison in the House, Dr. Evatt said the Waterside Workers’ Federation was to some extent an obstruction to the Government’s foreign policy, but it
could not be said that the federation dictated policy.”
“I know you fellows are a little obstructive, but don’t you dare get the idea you are dictators!”

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Clooter”: The old penny-a-line re-
porter who could never say “Mr. Jones’s
haystack was burned,” but always made
it “a holocaust of flame devoured the
stored fodder provided for his stock by
Mr. William Henry Jones,” is gone, but
his imitators are still with us, notably
in current Test-cricket reports, which
somehow have become warlike dispatches.
Thus:
Compton—his the rallying bugle call,
the four-square defence of the iron bastion,
the first gallant foray in an hour when the
rigors of the siege should have exhausted
the tiny garrison to the point of surrender.
It appears that Mr. Compton made 184
runs at cricket. However, a much more
striking manipulation of the language
was to come:
And then Evans fell. There had been
a death-or-glory quality about his batting
when, widowed of Compton,
No, dear, it had nothing to do with the
sex question, it merely meant that Mr.
Evans was batting well when Mr.
Compton fell over his stumps and was
given out. After another fearful look at
the “iron bastion” I retired to my ivory
lower, and there dug up an old copy of
“ Isn't that gorgeous? I think I'll marry Basil after all!”
the Bogan Gate “Gazette” carrying this
item: “At Leeds yesterday Bradman, the
Australian cricketer, made 334 runs. Not
bad for a boy.”
* * * *
“Chevroford”: Urgent appeals have
been made to Melbourne’s citizenry to
put their city in order against next year’s
Royal visit, and a general face-lifting and
kalsomining of public and private build-
ings has been suggested. It is to be hoped
it doesn’t go too far. Walking up Swan-
ston-street the other evening I was struck
by the majestic appearance of the Town
Hall. The patina that half a century
of soot and smoke have given it made it
look beautiful. A dozen painters could
undo Nature’s work in half a day as
they did in the Fitzroy Gardens when the
effigies of Hercules, Venus, Adonis and
Diana and her faun were cleaned and
whitewashed, with the result that the
poverty of their sculpture was revealed in
all its nakedness and the effect was so
awful that the statuary was removed
altogether. Paris is regarded as the
world’s most beautiful cifs, and one of the
reasons is that it never cleans its build-
ings.

Chances of real escape from
Jap captivity were practically nil, though
it was possible to escape from your im-
mediate prison. The terrain was the
difficulty ; some who escaped in Burma
perished in the attempt to reach India.
Commuffication with other camps,
although forbidden, was possible. One
Australian on Singapore Island solved
the problem when he wanted to see a
cobber in the next camp, two miles away.
He got a barrow and placed in it a
small load of rubble. Then with that
look-of-one-who-works he wheeled his
barrow past the Nipponese guards.
Along Bukit Timah-road he trundled it
and met with glances only approving. He
reached his friend’s camp, had a yarn,
and returned. Same barrow, same load
—but the effort well worth while.

“Nakh”: One of the joys or horrors
of my childhood used to be the visit of
the chimney-sweep and his boy, I knew
of their imminent approach when my
mother began rolling up the carpets,
covering the furniture with newspaper
and preparing a huge cauldron of tea —•
she firmly believed that most of the
soot wlent down the sweep’s throat and
had to be periodically washed out lest
he die of suffocation. My interest
stemmed from my reading of Victorian
literature with harrowing descriptions of
boys being sent up chimneys, getting stuck
and having a fire lighted underneath them
so that their struggles would drive them
further up and finally out to freedom.
I used to stand in the backyard intently
watching the tops of the chimneys, and
my relief was intense when, instead of a
sooty imp, the sweep’s immense mop rose
up like a black chrysanthemum into the
daylight. Strange to say, although the
number of fuel-burning fireplaces has
more than trebled in Melbourne, there
are only nine of the craft in the whole
metropolitan area. Even stranger, they
charge only 6s. a chimney, against ss.
when I was in knickers. As far as I can
find there is no recorded instance of a
boy being sent up a Melbourne chimney.

“Ray Whiting”: “Free” medicine? In
Syria the Wogs used to pester our R.A.P.
for it. One bloke wasi probably cured
for life by the issue he got just before we
left. He was a very fit specimen who was
always cadging medicine. Eventually
the sight of the whining, but perfectly
healthy, dial got the R.A.P. corp. down.
“Righto,” he said. “Cop this.” With shin-
ing eyes Abdullah gulped down six beauti-
ful pills—three No. 9’s and three morphia
—a prescription many M.Os, would no
doubt like to prescribe for Senator
McKenna.
“Horseface”: My first successful con-
tribution to The Bulletin from the
banks of the Maranoa —it was long ago
—encouraged me to send a poem to a
Brisbane daily. In the accompanying
letter I wrote: “Written in the bush, by
a bushman, for a bushman’s paper, about
the bush.” The verses appeared in the
next issue after receipt of the opus, pre-
faced by the remarks from the editor:
“Accepted in the spirit of the bush by the
“Blast this bloke Les Sylphides—come to bed!”
bush editor, who feels that good wine
needs no bush.” Next time I was in Bris-
bane I ran gaily up the stairs to the office
of the daily; I estimated the cheque
would be at least two guineas. The
sub-editor had to search the file for me
to identify the poem. “What was it you
wanted to see me about?” he asked
when we had found it. I told him. “Oh,”
he said. “We don’t have to pay for things
like that. We can get all our stuff of that
kind free.” Next time I sat up till mid-
night licking the stub of a pencil the
address on the envelope was The
Bulletin office.

“Derwent”: An old wreck off one of
the islands in Bass Strait is said by those
who have seen it at close quarters to
possess a figurehead of marble instead of
the usual carved wood. Although marble
figureheads are not unknown, they are
rare; hut my informants stick to their
assertion regarding this one, and tell
me they even tried to get it off, but with-
out success. Can old hands identify the
wreck?
* * * *
“Oxmead”: That “No Snakes in Ice-
land” yarn is a good deal older than
Josh Billings (B. 9/6/’4B). The original
may be found in one of Boswell’s
reminiscences, written in 1778:
Johnson said that he could repeat a com-
plete chapter of The Natural History of
Iceland, from the Danish of Horrebow,
the whole of which was exactly thus:
“Chap. LXXII. Concerning Snakes. There
are no snakes to be met with throughout
the whole island.”
* * * ♦
“Big Mac”; Col. Light planned
Adelaide as the perfect city, but ever
since he left the drawing-board people
and outside factors have been working
against that ideal. The plan was upset
early in the piece by narrow Rundle-
street becoming the main shopping area
and traffic lane; today the wide central
streets of the city look almost naked in
comparison. J. R. Dridan, a water-supply
engineer, has advanced an explanation.
In the early days water had to be carted
from the Torrens. Because Rundle-street
was nearer, water was cheaper there than
further south.
* * * ♦
“Sleepy Hollow”: “L.A.M.” (B,
5 151 ’4B) errs in thinking his grandfather,
Captain Frederick Moore, of the brigan-
tine Jewess, was the first discoverer of
coal in Maoriland. The 50 tons of coal
brought by Moore from West Wanganui
to Wellington, in December, 1840, was
the first N.Z. coal on sale there, but
Colonel Wakefield, advance agent for the
N.Z. company, on his first arrival from
Britain in August, 1839, was given a
lump of West Wanganui coal by a Maori
chief in Queen Charlotte Sound, and a
few days later saw on the beach at Te
Awaite whaling station, Tory Channel, 10
tons of this coal just brought across from
West Wanganui by Dicky Barrett. Who
was the first discoverer deponent
knoweth not. Te Awaite whaling station,
still operating, was founded by John
Guard in 1827. Guard was sealing in
N.Z. from 1823 on, and the sealing-
grounds extended up Nelson’s west coast
to near West Wanganui.
♦ * * •
“Wellsbach”: The greatest pest with
which the old-time lamplighter had to
contend (B. 9/6/’4B) was not the stone-
throwing larrikin but the type which
used to shin up the post, open the si -
door and plant a bunger inside. Wn
the ’lighter came along on his bicyci ,
reached up with his stick and pulled the
ring, the tiny pilot-light would _ ignite
the gas inside the mantle and this,
in turn, would set-off the bunger. There
w'ould be a fizzing sound from the fuse,
a flash, a loud bang and the lamp would
not only have the glass blown out of
its frame, but the gas-mantle and the
lamp-chimney inside would also be
wrecked—damage which even a well-
aimed rock could not equal. The pastime
went out of fashion —in Adelaide, at
any rate —after a magistrate gave an
offender three months’ instead of the
usual fine.
* * ♦ ♦
“T.McN.”: Last week’s N.S.W. North
Coast floods brought the inevitable city
reporters to the scene, and their readers
for the most part were given fairly good
descriptions of the floods and the damage,
illustrated with some striking aerial photo-
graphs. But why, oh why, will they spoil
their reports with this sort of thing,
splashed in bold type across two columns
of one Sydney paper?:—
Pupils of St. Mary’s Convent, near
Grafton, screamed in terror today when
floodwaters from the Clarence River carried
death adders and other poisonous snakes
past the schoolgrounds. The snakes, which
were curled on top of bunches of water
hyacinth torn loose by the flood, floated
within a few feet of the children.
I wonder who told him that ?
* * * *
“Muskeen”: Was under the impres-
sion that the term “foxhole” in the mili-
tary sense originated in the S.-W. Pacific
jungles during World War 11. However,
in Blackmore’s Lorna Doone, when the
Doones are lying in wait for Jeremy
Stickler, Marwood de Whichehalse re-
marks: “I love to meet a man sword to
sword; not to pop at him from a fox-
hole.”'

“Jasby’s” barber on free medicine:
“I see the doctors are arguing with the
Government over this free medicine,” said my
barber, “and I don’t blame ’em,'either. It’s
this here formilliary that’s the trouble. My
doc. was telling me about it last night. Doesn’t
go far enough, he says. Too right it doesn’t.
What’s good for one man ain’t always good
for another. Take me. Soon as I feel a cold
coming on I pop into the pub next door and
down a couple of tots of rum and milk. Fixes
the cold in no time. But is rum in the formil-
liary? You bet your life it ain’t. Nor milk,
for that matter. My wife’s different. She
swears by doctors’ physic. So the Government’s
going to give us her medicine free, and still
make me pay for my rum. Where’s the fairness
come in? And mind you, the wife likes her
drop o’ stout for her anaemia, and the doc.
recommends it. But who pays for it? I do,
of course. It ain’t in the formilliary. Npw
I reckon rum and stout is just as much medicine
as the stuff the chemists dole out and a darn
sight more effective, too. When I sink a rum
I can feel my toes tingle and I know the cold’s
as good as beat. Ever get that feeling from
chemists’ medicine? I’ll guarantee you haven’t
—nor anyone else either. And what about
my old mother that reckons if it wasn’t for
her little drop of gin regular she’d ’a’ bin in
her grave years ago? No chemist’ll sell her
that; it ain’t in the formilliary, yet whered
she be without it? And who pays for it?—
Muggins, of course. Free medicine? Dont
make me laugh. And another thing, why
should the chemists cop the lot? It’s a racket,
that’s what it is. Look at that hair-restorer
•on the shelf. Guaranteed to make the hair
grow, restore the shiny lustre to dull, tired
hair, and beneficial to the scalp as well. B
that ain’t medicine, what is? But the Govern-
ment don’t think so. It ain’t in the formilliary.
Good luck to the 8.M.A., I say. I hope they
stick out until the Government puts in every-
thing—rum and milk, and stout, and gin, and
brandy. I’m not so sure about beer. They say
it’s more of a food than anything, and I dont
want to make it too hot. Still, there’s some
blokes can’t do without it, so I suppose that
makes it medicine and it ought to be free tor
them. Only on a doctor’s prescription, ot
course.” “What about hair-restorer?” I asked.
“Yes, that’ll have to be in,” said my barber with
conviction. “I don’t see why the chemists should
cop the lot.”
TRUE ENOUGH.
“The present Commonwealth Government has done
things not dreamed of ten years ago.” —Prime
Minister Chifley at the A.L.P. Annual Conference.
It has undoubtedly, and not a few;
Your bitterest opponents, Ben, forsooth
Who’ve little time for aught you say or do,
Will frankly own that this is frozen truth,
A statement that admits of no demur,
One with which all may readily concur.
Ten years ago, would any Ministry
Have tolerated the outrageous stunt
Of being informed our foreign policy
Must be decided on the waterfront,
And then have knuckled down (.to quote your
phrase)
Sooner than “set the waterfront ablaze”?
Ten years ago, would anyone have thought
That private banks might in the back be
stabbed
Without some indication being sought
If people would approve their being grabbed,
Or whether it was legal anyhow—
A question still unsettled up to now?
Ten years ago, would anyone have said
Or even hinted that the sort of man
To choose for a viceregal figurehead
Would win the job by being a partisan,
A lifelong barracker for one and all
Who helped to set him on his, pedestal?
Ten years ago, who would have visioned such
Rewards for those who frame our laws as
these
To which they’re now entitled —half as much
Again in Parliamentary salaries,
With prospects well-assured of more and more
Remunerative seats to scramble for?
Ah, Ben, whatever the accomplished schemes
On which you pride yourself, you sure can
show
Much that you’ve done was only glimpsed in
dreams,
And none too pleasant ones, ten years ago.
Let me assure you without prejudice
You never spoke a truer word than this.

“M. 8”: The Sabbath afternoon was
cold, wet and miserable and the suburb
huddled over its fires, listening to the
gale whooping outside and the rain driv-
ing against the windows. Then came a
lull as the wind dropped and a watery
sun shone palely through the cloud-wrack.
Two small boys appeared, bowling an
ancient motor-tyre, laughing and shout-
ing as it rolled through puddles and sent
up showers of spray. More small boys
joined in the fun, and over gates and
from shop doorways, from under bushes
and the backs of garages raced the in-
evitable dogs, which ran, barked, laughed
and splashed with the bowling tyre and
the running boys. A big Alsatian loped
along, and, with all the arrogance of his
size and importance, shouldered through
the minor mongs, investigated the tyre,
cast a supercilious glance about him and
proceeded to drag it towards his home,
The kids called him names, but feared
to contest his grip on the trophy; the
varied hounds pretended to be interested
in other things. Then appeared a small
dog with the tail of a Pomeranian, the
head of an Irish Terrier and the color of
a ginger-nut. He studied the situation
for a moment, then went for the Alsatian
with his ears back. In a flash nine dogs
were fighting, with the Alsatian in the
midst of them, the kids urging them on.
Sun vanished, wind swept back, down
came the rain. Through the deluge the
watchers on verandahs and at windows
saw a black-haired boy racing for shelter
with his tyre on his arm, a bedraggled
ginger mongrel escorting him. We went
back to our fires and books immeasurably
cheered, feeling that justice was not dead
nor the clouds eternal.

“Ek Bum”: Let me raise a shout of
protest against the habit which has grown
up during the war of referring to the
New Guinea native as a “boong” or a
“coon.” “Boong” comes from Alice
Springs, and originally was the local con-
temptuous term for the unfortunate
illegitimate half-caste children who used
to inhabit the horrible corrugated-iron
black hole which the authorities were
pleased to designate as “the bungalow.”
And coon is not a very complimentary
American term derived from an animal
shot for its fur. The old and invariable
generic term “boy” is much more pleasing
and accurately descriptive. That is what
the New Guinea native is when unspoilt
—a lighthearted, typical, mischievous,
affectionate, loyal, playful boy, with all
growing boys’ habits of appetite, rest-
lessness, vigor and gaiety.

“Gravelsnatcher”: A Perth man who
has started a flying dental service over
the north of W.A. has been welcomed
with open mouths by people who can’t
afford the time or cost involved in a
thousand-mile journey to a dental parlor.
He found the north broken-toothed and
tender, and left it contentedly eating slops
until he returns with the plastics and
pegs. He rates natives as his best patients,
and wonders if he’s learnt something
from a chap who filled his own tooth
with ordinary cement. The filling wasn’t
“Will that be all now, Madam?”
an unqualified success, but apart from
that the chap has introduced something
new to dental science. As a nerve-
killing agent he claims to have used
sulphuric acid —something not even the
Army dentists thought of.

“Balander”; Bundaberg, famous for
rum, Hinkler and Gladys Moncrieff;
Warwick, which produced the egg which
hatched out Billy Hughes’s ' Common-
wealth police force; Gympie, whose
butter and Light Horsemen put it on the
map; Goondiwindi, border town of
wool, cattle and benders —all are “in-
censed” because they’ve been overlooked
by the bosses of the Royal Itinerary next
April. So far no signs of secession have
appeared, though some bloke in a Goon-
diwindi bar was heard muttering darkly
about going to Tenterfield to live. War-
wick and Gympie have lodged “formal
protests,” but nobody has been able to
find any basis for the rumor that mal-
contents from the former place propose
to invade the nearest town blessed with
a Royal visit and drink all the beer before
the procession arrives. All the same, the
tour-arrangers shouldn’t disregard the
protests. How would they like it if the
Dynevor bunyip was sooled on to howl
in the middle of some sweating Mayor’s
welcome speech?

“F.S.”; Melbourne Gallery’s latest
acquisition, the £11,250 “View from the
Mouth of the Thames,” by Gainsborough,
has at least one thing in common with the
trademark of a popular brand of Aus-
tralian matches. The artist who designed
the yacht on the boxes made every mis-
take known to nautical science, and
Gainsborough is guilty of several boners
in his picture. Judging by her burgee, the
Thames barge shown in the foreground
is running free, but the two behind
her appear to be close-hauled, although
they are further off the wind than she is.
Sir Thomas’s boats look like boats,
though, and his water looks like water,
whereas the pictures of Arthur Burgess,
the marine artist, who never makes tech-
nical bloomers, don’t look like real boats
or water. So which are the truer pictures?

“Conda”; That magnetic mine which

“Scribe”: Hand-engrossing of pro-

emplifications in Queensland will soon be
a thing of the past. An Order-in-Council,
published in May, now permits type-
written or printed engrossments and
photostat copies of wills. In recent years
the engrossing standard has not been high,
and the services of competent penmen
have been difficult to get. As typing
is more -convenient and more profitable
to the practitioner, the few remaining
engrossers can put their nibs, texting-
pencils, pounce (if they have any) and
other paraphernalia in the local museum,

“Zake”: Family men in Sydney are
justly incensed at the constant adjuration
levelled at them by the g.m. of the Gas
Co. not to waste gas. Heaven knows,
what with having to spar up 4d. for an
apple and 7d. for a two-mouthful lamb
chop, their opportunities to indulge in
recreation are necessarily limited ; yet
here they are being asked to forgo their
favorite sport, that of lighting the stove-
jets just to watch them burn. With what
a thrill I light up the oven again, after
the wife has finished baking, just for the
sheer joy of gazing at the parallel lines
of flames burning blue, with yellow at
the tip! As one who gets a real kick
out of paying large gas bills and thus
ensuring not only that shareholders won’t
fall on such evil times that they may
have to trade their Buicks in for bikes,
but also that the Commo gassies can be
given quail on toast with their morning-
tea and perfumed overalls to work in, 1
hotly resent this interference with my
chosen philanthropical work. Just to
spite them, I’m going to leave the gas-
fire going all night!

“Harold Hardupp”: Nowadays anyone
with the money can buy a swanky car
without incurring a charge of social pre-
sumption ; in the old horse-vehicle days
the style of the equipage was part of the
conventions of the caste system. I remem-
ber my family and its friends were deeply
agitated by the “scandal” when a wealthy
grocer bought a “carriage and pair”;
that a man merely “in the retail” should
ape the splendors of the elite was regarded
as vulgar presumption. Many of his
wealthiest customers transferred their
custom to a “deserving young man” who
had opened a,, rival grocery and knew
his place better. The hoi-polloi had the
same view; larrikins threw stones at the
carriage of Mr. Sugarsander as a sign
of contempt for his swank, and the police
by masterly inactivity seemed to indicate
that they thought Sugarsander had been
asking for it. Bowing to the storm,
Sugarsander exchanged his equipage for
a “sociable,” “more suitable for his
station.” He later had ago for municipal
honors, but ran last in his ward. The
man who had run his campaign was not
surprised. “It will take him a long time
to live down that carriage-and-pair inci-
dent,” he told my parents.

“Bo”: The audience at the Sydney Con-
servatorium was tense —the dramatic
scene in the Con. Opera School’s pro-
duction of “Cavalleria Rusticana” was
reaching its climax as the gay philanderer
Turiddu and the jealous Alfio snarled at
one another over who was to have the
haughty, naughty Lola. Then suddenly
the tenor sprang lithely at the bluste. ag
baritone and savagely fastened his teeth
in his rival’s lug—the traditional Sicilian
challenge of a fight to the death. As
Alfio departed in a tearing rage to put
the hone over his trusted pig-sticker the
while Turiddu consoled his anxious Ma
a voice floated, sotto voce, from a few
seats back: “That’s the worst of these
uncivilised places—now, if they only
played Rugby League there they wouldn’t
take any notice of a little thing like
that!”

“Waddlin’ Willie”: One of Mel-
bourne’s general practitioners with a real
sense of humor has many of Victoria’s
pathological “worry-bags” guessing. With
the assistance of artist Alec Gurney he
wrote a small book, Sickness Without Sor-
row. It sold well, and most purchasers got
their money’s worth in laughter, for it
was a humorous commentary on the
doc.’s daily experiences. Others, fearing
some of the characters in the book were
themselves, endeavored to find the
author’s name. But it was without avail.
He remained anonymous even when he
sent Melbourne’s Lord Mayor a handy
sum from the book’s royalties for the
Food for Britain fund. There the mystery
stands.
UNFAIR.
“A girl has a much better chance of contracting an
advantageous marriage if she is a typist in a city
office than if she has studied hard and long to
achieve a University degree and is sent to the average
up-country town where there is a dearth of marriage-
able bachelors.” —Letter in “S. M. Herald
A fine ambition, sure, in its essentials,
An admirable notion, none dispute,
Obtaining University credentials
“To teach the young idea how to shoot.”
The only trouble is that the potentials
It holds for getting married are minute
Compared with those that come, ’most any day,
The city typist’s less exalted way.
The teacher qualifies for her profession,
With honors like enough, and off she goes,
Diplomas and degrees in her possession,
To some provincial town where —starve the
crows! —
There’s nothing to discount the sad impression
About the dearth of eligible beaus;
Bills languishing for non-existent Bets
And Romeos unequipped with Juliets.
The typist has no academic backing,
No letters to affix behind her name,
But if adornments such as these are lacking
They may be negligible all the same,
And more than counterbalanced by her whacking
Advantage in the matrimonial game,
When any tinkle from the ’phone may fall
To be the prelude of a mating-call.
You heads of educational committees
Who send young schoolmarms to the hills
and dales
Outback, come, isn’t it a thousand pities
To keep them where such scarcity prevails?
Grant them, at least, alternate terms in cities
Where there are stacks of marriageable males,
To give them equal chances with the shes
Whose job is tapping stenographic keys.

THE SERVICE MAN
"Operation Opulence."
“Ek Dum”: The report of
Major-General C. E. M, Lloyd,
formerly Adjutant-General, and
Mr. Massey Stanley on the con-
ditions under which the 8..C.0.F.
exists in Japan, was lost (or
something) on its way to Can-
berra, and there seems to have
been some muddle about the
issue of it. It is a very good
report, covering its subject-
matter concisely and indulging
in little comment, save for con-
structive purposes. It also makes
the reader wonder why the
present sad depletion of
8.C.0.F, is taking place.
8.C.0.F, —the only permanent
force in the Australian Army on
a regimental and expeditionary
basis —is languishing and fading.
It consists of a single
“brigade”—the 34th —made up
of the 65th, 66th and 67th “Bat-
talions.” These terms are purely
formal. The brigade is not a
brigade in strength and the
battalions are not battalions.
They make up a total of around
800 men, and it is about the
affairs of these, commanded by
a top-ranking general in the Per-
manent Military Forces, that it
has been necessary to send a
major-general, a war corres-
pondent and some senior
chaplains on an 8000-mile
journey there and back, to in-
quire.
The Lloyd-Stanley report says
that apart from single men in
8.C.0.F. there is now a sub-
stantial Australian community
attached to the force.
All visitors, it is recorded,
are struck by the “unusually
high standard of comfort” en-
joyed by the force and its de-
pendants, which “in many in-
stances approaches luxury,” The
conditions, to the two reporters,
both of whom have seen their
military world, are “superior to
any the British services have
hitherto experienced at home or
on foreign service.” It seems
that Australians can look on
their standards in Japan, in com-
parison with those enjoyed by
Americans, without a single
pang.
The clubs and recreation-
rooms of all ranks are
“furnished on a scale to which
the most opulent suburban and
sporting clubs in Australia would
regard as impractical of attain-
ment.” Housing for families is
of such a standard that “in the
most detached appraisal it is
difficult to avoid superlatives.”
One Big Family
There is no distinction be-
tween officers and other ranks in
regard to houses available.
Other high-Tory countries like
Britain and the United States be-
lieve that it is in the interests of
democracy that living areas
should be classified. But in the
Australian zone the humblest
private has exactly the same
rights as the full major,
except that the full major
has the privilege of paying more
rent, house for house, and gener-
ally of making his pay go a
shorter way.
In the American Army the
lowest ranks are not allowed to
bring their families to Japan.
N.Z. does not permit dependants
to come at all. And the British
classify their areas so that all
ranks are not mixed together to
their mutual embarrassment.
Mr. Chambers’s Army is one
great big family, no doubt to the
great scandal of the class-
conscious Russians, who segre-
gate officers and other ranks
from one another sedulously.
The largest settlement of
Australians is aptly named —
though in Japanese—Rainbow
Village. The maximum rent
which may be deducted from a
private’s pay, no matter what
size his dwelling, is £34, while a
lieutenant-colonel for the same
accommodation may well be
mulcted up to £llO p.a.
Subject to this the normal
rent of a three-bedroom house
of American design occupying
1310 sq, ft. of usable space is
31s. 2d. per week. The rent does
not cover merely the house. It
covers free telephones, hot-
water and all electric cooking
apparatus, all furniture and
equipment. There is no charge
for dental, medical or hospital
(including obstetric) services.
The nightly cinema is free —
so are sports amenities, provided
out of the C.-in-C.’s amenities
fund. Annual leave brings with
it the right of free travel to one
of the luxurious resorts which
the Australian Government has
provided for its soldiery and
their families, for whom nothing
appears to be too expensive.
One such is mentioned in the
Lloyd - Stanley report the
Kawana Hotel, two hours from
Tokyo “in a fashionable spa
area.” In pre-war days it was
“an exclusive resort of top-
bracket millionaires,” but now it
is open to all 8.C.0.F. ranks,
who are provided (for a nominal
charge or fee) with “sport, golf,
riding” and other normally ex-
pensive pleasures which the Aus-
tralian taxpayer rarefy enjoys;
all these “within the grounds of
the hotel.” There is also men-
tioned Sumitomo, a villa near
Kobe, a sumptuous home of one
of the Zaibutsu, the reign-
ing millionaire families, which
also has been roped in in the
cause of Australian democracy.
And in Tokyo the huge and
fashionable Marunouchi Hotel,
which is large enough to house
the whole of 8.C.0.F. proper, is
maintained by the Australian
Government on a scale of luxury
which makes it a privilege for
the miserable fellows who owe
allegiance to Allied countries
with less expansive views to
claim sanctuary there. Its steaks
are famous, its general cuisine
savors of St. Petersburg in its
prime by comparison with most
other hostelries.
Tax-free Travel
The Australian soldier in the
ranks in Japan is not taxed —
he gets his £3OO-odd clear of the
burdens which fall on persons
of similar income in Australia.
The private and his family,
when they arrive, are immedi-
ately delighted to discover that
it is “undesirable that Australian
women should, while in Japan,
do household tasks.”
Every soldier from colonel to
private, therefore, is entitled to
three servants, free, save that he
has to feed them, which proves
an' awkward snag. British
officers are compelled to pay for
their servants out of a meagre
servant allowance.
It is not surprising to learn
that “for certain wives the tran-
sition from the domestic routine
of an Australian home has
proved unsettling,” and that
there has developed “competitive
social life resulting in financial
strain,” particularly among those
in the junior ranks.
For those among the exiled
brigade (or short battalion) who
wish to improve themselves
against a return to civilian life
there is a scheine to promote
“adult education in every pos-
sible direction.” Men in need of
basic schooling have six hours
per week of their official time
set aside for school. Trade
courses and hobby development
free of charge is a feature
of operations, and wives may
take hobby courses for which
they are charged only for
materials.
The percentage of the force
interested appears to be only
8 per cent, to 10 per cent. “The
only compulsory action in the
8.C.0.F, schedule is the weekly
discussion hour on current
topics.” To a non-Government
mind it is inexplicable why it is
necessary to compel soldiery on
foreign service to indulge in a
weekly discussion on current
affairs.
For children education is free
—there are 390, with 20 teachers.
Tuition includes such extras as
music lessons.
Though the rents which the
Australian families are paying
would be “fantastically low for
much inferior ( accommodation
in their own home towns” —
where they would not get tele-
phone, furniture and three

Each Tablet An Effective Dose!
It’s amazing how quickly one small Ephazone
tablet acts in cases of Asthma. On reaching
the stomach healing agents are released and
start to clear the germ-laden accumulations
which constrict the bronchial tubes.
No matter how swift the attack, there
is always time to take Ephazone.
Nothing to inject—nothing to inhale.
For the rapid relief of Asthma, Bron-
chitis, Bronchial Catarrh and Hay Fever, Ephazone is unsur-
passed. Try it, and know the boon of easy breathing.

IB 27 FOUNDATION OF HAIG
On August 20th, 1835, only two months after John Batman made
his historical statement “This will be the place for a village,”
a small party organised by John Pascoe Fawkner and under the
direction of Capt. John H. Lancey anchored the
“Enterprise” in the Yarra. The excellent soil, fine
timber and abundant water so pleased them that they
made up their minds “to settle and share the land
in the most satisfactory manner to all parties,”

servants thrown in, and where
some of them have their normal
homes let at high rentals —there
is an incessant grumble at having
to pay rent at all and protests
about the foolishness of having
“fallen for recruiting talk.” This
grumbling is limited to a section.
But generally speaking the in-
vestigators found the “standard
of amenities unparalleled in our
experience.” All families have
liaison officers to keep in touch
with them and their problems
and staff officers to take care of
their interests.
Blackmarketing, as it is under-
stood in Australia, is virtually
non-existent among troops. Its
most regular manifestation is the
exchange of small luxuries for
curios to send home. It is a
wonder, seeing the great dis-
parity between U.S. and other
prices and the special scale of
Australian standard prices, which
are much lower and which the
troops enjoy.
The Red' Plague
The one bugbear appears to
be V.D., and upon this the report
is extensive. It appears that
Japan has become a cesspool in
this respect—once, when traffic
was rigidly .controlled by the
Government, it was the cleanest
country in the Orient and per-
haps in the world.
The New England conscience,
however, does not go with
control, and a dreadful harvest
has been reaped. When the first
forces went to Japan the infec-
tion rates were prodigious. The
U.S. rate in early 1946 was up
as high as 672 per 1000 per
annum. Then Mr. Patterson,
Secretary for War, introduced a
new policy which left the com-
mand no option in dealing with
the scourge. It is handled
purely on a question of military
policy on the highest level, with
efficiency as a basis —different
from the normal U.S. one of
yore in vogue till a few months
ago which means that any
officer infected will lose his
career, and any man infected
finds himself going through a
course of rehabilitation which
he is unlikely to forget.
General Lloyd and Mr.
Stanley declare that this reduced
rates immediately, even by anti-
cipation, to 120 per 1000 per
annum. An outsider might ques-
tion whether some of this re-
duction was not due to conceal-
ment, which had become worth
while, but they apparently think
not.
They cite specific cases, includ-
ing an experimental all-negro
battalion which had a rate of
643 in August, 1947, and one
of 120 per 1000 at April 29 last.
The 8.C.0.F. rate was 650 per
1000 in September, 1946. This
was reduced to 325 in 1947, 338
in December, 1947, and 220 at
present. This is higher than that
of any force in Japan, except
the Maorilanders, though the
committee takes some comfort
from the fact that it is lower
than the latest British rate in
Europe in December (377). The
overall rate among troops in
Europe is npw about 250 —rates,
as in the East, fluctuate consider-
ably. The pity of it is the large
proportion affected between 19
and 21 years of age.
If the committee is right, there
is only one conclusion to draw
from the facts. And that is that
the Government is to blame for
failing to lay down a rigid deter-
rent policy and give the com-
mand not only power but a firm
instruction to enforce it to the
limit as is done by the Ameri-
cans. Apparently it would not
seem democratic to Canberra to
interfere too rigidly with the
affairs of these inexperienced
youngsters, many of whom are
away from home for the first
time.
A study of the graphs which
accompany the report support
the conclusion that liquor is the
evil mother of most of the
trouble. After Easter and Anzac
Day and after Christmas the
figures soar.
“Morale Is High”
It is, however, good to know
that the “general discipline of
the force is not generally
affected,” Morale is high despite
the adverse effect of the with-
drawals of the British and Indian
units, the prospective withdrawal
of the New Zealanders, and the
intemperate attacks on morality
and discipline which have been
made from the Australian end.
The troops are described as.
“clean, smart and soldierly,” and
generally show signs of being a
well-disciplined and self-respect-
ing force. Crime statistics are
low, general conduct good. And
the appearance of our guards in
Tokyo brought about a general
smartening-up of the appearance
of other forces.
What seems to be needed is a
more permanent routine based
on the realities of military life
in foreign parts. And it is ques-
tionable whether dependants are
in their right place in a con-
quered country which is in a
state of ruin from bombing, and
which at any time might be the
scene of some post-war epidemic.
The Fiaschis.
From one of a troop of
friends:
Dr. Thomas Henry Fiaschi, a great
Sydney surgeon of other days, a
soldier and a vigneron withal, went
off to the South African war with his
son Carlo, returning with the D.S.O.
and a mention in dispatches “for
services at Paardeberg,” where
Cronje’s commandos were rounded
up. Carlo, a splendid fellow, died
young, but by the time the First
World War came round there was
another doctor-son ready for service:
Piero, who had graduated in medicine
at Columbia University (U.S.A.) and
in dentistry at the New York College.
So 'off to tljat war went the old
doctor (62) and Piero (37). At first
in the Light Horse, “in charge of
100 animals,” the son soon wearied
of being a glorified vet. and aban-
doned the role, his final report on
his steeds being “Lost three; gained
one.” An Army surgeon on Gallipoli,
he saw the campaign through. His
father was near him, doing hospital
work on Lemnos.
Piero went to France with his
assistant, Warrant-officer Ferguson,
who had worked for the old doctor
as a boy. Except when Ferguson
went down with rheumatic fever,
they were together until the doctor
got his Anzac leave. Strong and brave
men both, with a great sense of duty,
they did noble work for the wounded
and sick, work remembered by many
Old Diggers today. Reunited in Aus-
tralia, they were separated only by
death. Ferguson, a Burwood Coun-
cil inspector, died four months ago;
the doctor last week in Sydney Hos-
pital.
For 65 years Fiaschi has been a
name honored in that institution.
When the father was no more, the
son took up his work as honorary
surgeon and the kindly offices he
performed for the veterans of the
Lancers and the South African Sol-
diers’ Association. And, with all
the fathers ardor and sacrifice of
self, the son threw himself into the
defence movement, as commanding
officer of the Bth Field Ambulance
and the 4th Cavalry Field Ambulance
Division and A.D.M.S. of the Ist
Cavalry Division. It was a blow
to him when the old citizen army
was skittled, as it was, when at the
highest point of efficiency and enthu-
siasm, in 1930.
There were few better-known figures
in the Sydney streets than Piero
Fiaschi, his tall form, clad in a suit
of sober black surmounted by a
boxer hat, outlined against the sky.
With his keen, animated face he
would have been a perfect subject
for a painting of an ageing Digger.
As Dr. F. A. Maguire said, in a
moving oration at St. James’s Church,
over the coffin draped in the Union
Jack, Piero was “a personality” if
ever there was one. He had a
genius for friendship, and his friends
were in all walks of life. Among
them were W. M. Hughes and Dr.
Bradfield; Harry Chauvel, Glasgow,
Rosenthal, Manchester, Maguire, a
host of other A.I.F. generals, senior
and junior officers, non-coms, and
privates—with whom he walked in
every Anzac Day procession, even
to the last, when he was in failing
health; writers, publishers, politicians
(both sides), aldermen, businessmen,
-Sudan Contingenters and countless
others of many nationalities and
callings. He had a piercing voice,
which rose to a shout when he was
excited, as he often was, for he had
an explosive temper. It fell invariably
when he referred to ‘‘my dear old
father” (always so mentioned), to the
fate of the 10th Light Horse on
Gallipoli and to the dead and
wounded of the frightful campaign
on the Somme.
Dr. Fiaschi is survived by Mrs.
Fiaschi, by his daughter, who is
married to a newspaperman, Colin
Mann, and by his two sisters. One
of the sisters married a cousin of
Margot Tennant, who became
Asquith’s second wife. The other,
a native of the Hawkesbury, like all
the children of Dr. T. H. Fiaschi,
is the Marchese Torrigiani. She lives
at Florence, Italy, where, 95 years
ago, her father was born.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Commander G. C. Oldham, D.S.C.,
new Director of Naval Intelligence in
Melbourne, is possibly the sole remaining
naval air-observer in the R.A.N. His
interest in flying came from early contact
with carriers, when, as a Jervis Bay
“snotty,” he went to R.N. carriers
Glorious and Eagle, followed by 15
months in our old Albatross, Start of
the last scrap found him Staff Officer
Operations and Intelligence to Rear-
Admiral Grace; he was still with him
when cruiser Australia fought her share
of the Coral Sea battle. Followed com-
mand of sloop Swan in mid-1942, after
refitting from damage collected aft in
Darwin’s first raid, with a return to
cruisers in Shropshire two years later.
At Leyte bombardment Oldham won a,
D.S.C., and his second “mention” at
the following Lingayen party. His last
sea appointment was command of Fleet
destroyer Warramunga.
S.A.’s new knight. Justice Herbert
Mayo, has been senior puisne Judge of
the Supreme Court since 1942, when
Mellis Napier stepped up to become Chief
Justice, Adelaide-born, Mayo was edu-
cated at Saint’s, Adelaide ’Varsity, and
Trinity College, Melbourne, was admitted
to the Bar in 1909, practised for some
years in the Malice towns Pinnaroo and
Lameroo before joining an Adelaide firm.
In his student days he rowed for both
Adelaide and Melbourne Universities.
He is president of the S.A. Royal Geo-
graphical Society, former president of
the Law Council of Australia, the
Law Society of S.A., past Chancellor of
the Diocese of Adelaide, and the Diocese
of Willochra, and one-time lecturer of
Jurisprudence and Commercial Law at
Adelaide Uni. Related to the family
that founded the Mayo Clinic at
Rochester, U.S.A., he’s 63.
A new appointment to the staff of
Sydney University is that of Professor D.
Winston to the Chair of Town and
Country Planning. In addition to his
duties at the Uni., he will act in an ad-
visory capacity to the New South Wales
Government. At present he is borough
architect and general planning officer at
Southampton, England, where he has
had the job of planning the reconstruc-
tion of the city after war-time damage.
Previously he had advised the Northern
Ireland Government on post-war housing.
Since the days of Sherlock Holmes
no person has mystified the Englishman
more than Ernest Dudley, the 8.8.C.’s
“Armchair Detective,” now visiting Aus-
tralia to gauge its demand for crime-
fiction —particularly in broadcast form.
For years England has been crazy on
detective-stories, an average of six books
being published weekly, Dudley picks
the best three for his “Armchair Detec-
tive” session where, with the aid of a
bunch of actors, he dramatises the tales.
This) leads to “Crime Quiz,” another
session, where listeners send in queries on
the stories. But like all other “amateur” 1
detectives his knowledge is limited,
and frequently he solicits the aid of Scot-
land Yard men, private detectives and
“even a few crooks.” Perhaps while in
Melbourne he could solve the biggest
mystery in Victoria this year—who killed
gangster Coates?
From an old friend:
E. R. T. Reynolds, who won the Toorak
seat in the Victorian Assembly, is a solid,
capable K.C. who has fought his way
to the top with dogged persistence. Serving
four years in the A.I.F. in World War I, his
first big case when he returned was in T. J.
Ryan’s libel action against the Hobart “Mer-
cury,” for which he appeared with H. W.
Bryant, K.C., and J. G. Latham as his seniors.
The “Mercury’s” win in that case was largely
due to Reynolds’s astonishing capacity for work
and detail. He has since appeared in many
important causes, notably in the Cosgrove in-
quiry in Tasmania and in the defence of Robert
Close (Love Me, Sailor ), but generally speak-
ing his work is of a heavy and solid type, and
he is a specialist in Admiralty Court law. A
K.C. in Victoria since 1939, he was called in
N.S.W. in 1942. Since 1946 he has been chair-
man of the Committee of Counsel of the Vic-
torian Bar. Though not an orator, he will be
one of the solidest and ablest acquisitions the
Liberal party has had in any Parliament for
some years.
Dr. E. J. T. Thompson, Inspector-
General of Mental Hospitals in W.A., is
on his way to London as Commonwealth
delegate to the International Congress
on Mental Health. While over the other
side he will look into developments in
social and clinical psychiatry in Britain
and on the Continent and will report to
his Government on the virtues and vices
of Britain’s new medical scheme. Thomp-
son was born at Elgin, Scotland, 55 years
ago and came to Australia as a lad, but
has never really severed his connection
with the Land o’ Cakes. From Scotch
College, Perth, he .went to Glasgow Uni-
versity; he served in World War I with
the Highland Light Infantry and it’s

'Lieutenant-General Carl Jess, dead in
Melbourne at 64, was a schoolteacher and
a volunteer in the Victorian Rifles until
he joined the Permanent Forces in 1906.
A staff-captain at the Gallipoli Landing,
he commanded in France first the 7th
Battalion and then the 10th Infantry
Brigade; at 33 he was one of the youngest
brigadier-generals. Later he was G.O.C

Richardson a' man of the right age, ex-
perience and temperament.
Depicted here by Chester, William
Hogarth Robertson Nimmo, of Brisbane,
is president for the 1948-49 session of
the Institute of Engineers. Born in Eng-
land, he gained the degree of Master
of Civil Engineering at Melbourne Uni-
versity, and has been associated with
major hydro-electric and water-conser-
vation schemes for the greater part of
his career. At present he is chief engineer
of the Stanley River Works Board, and
ENGINEERING.
responsible for the design and construc-
tion of the Somerset Dam, calculated
to assure Brisbane’s water supply for
many years, and also to mitigate flood
danger. Nimmo is a member of the State
Electricity Commission of Queensland
and the committee which is reporting on
the Queensland artesian basin, and is
consulting engineer to the Co-ordinator-
General of Public Works, He was also
chairman of the board of engineers on
the construction of Cairncross Dock. His
work is his real hobby, but he plays a
sound game of golf when time permits.
Air-Vice-Marshal Edgar James King-
ston-McCloughry, recently appointed
Senior A.S.O. of Britain’s Fighter Com-
mand, is an Adelaide man who studied
engineering at Adelaide ’Varsity and
School of Mines, went to the first war
with the engineers and switched to the
Royal Flying Corps in 1917. He collected
a D.S.O. and a D.F.C. and bar in that
war and decided to make the R.A.F. his
career. When the second war came he
was Assistant-Commandant of the R.A.F.
College at Cranwell and in 1942 he
became A.O.C. 44 Group. Since 1946 he
has been 5.A.5.0., Air H.Q., in India.
He is 52, and holds a Cambridge M.A.
degree.
“Te Pana”: Sir Charles Matheson,
commodore of the Orient Line, dead in
London at 72, was known to his officers
and crews as “Dancing Charlie.” His
responsibilities as ship’s master, though
resting heavily on his shoulders, never in-
terfered with the lightness of his feet.
He made his last voyage to Australia in
1938 in the Oronsay, I travelled in the
ship on a Western Pacific tour, and the
memory of dancing nights aboard still
brings the drip of perspiration. Promptly
at 8.30 nightly he would appear on deck,
order the band to strike up, and step
into the jazz rhythm of the moment. By
9 o’clock his stiff shirt would be a limp
rag, but he would dance on until his
partners were out on their feet. No
one dared leave the deck while the com-
modore, a stickler for etiquette, went
shuffling along, and as the bar closed at
11 passengers suffered thirst pangs com-
parable only with those experienced in
the Far West. My last sight of him
struttin’ his stuff was in the ballroom of
the Grand Pacific Hotel, Suva. For the
remainder of the voyage I stayed below
decks where the sounds of the band were
not heard but where lights glistened on
the beer dregs of the bar counter.
Leonard S. Bell, B.A. LL.B., of Syd-
ney University, gets the distinction of
first Australian to win the Paul Harris
Foundation Rotary Scholarship entitling
him to a year’s study at any university
of his choice —he has plumped for Har-
vard. He is the son of Dr. Victor Bell,
of Strathfield (N.S.W.) kirk, and served
three years overseas with the A.I.F.
Proposed for the honorary degree of
Doctor of Civil Law at Oxford, James
Ralph Darling has been the unconven-
tional headmaster of Geelong Grammar
since 1930. Born in Kent and educated
at Oxford, he served in World War I, and
in 1929 led a tour of English schoolboys
to New Zealand. When he took over Gee-
long Grammar he changed the routine in
a way which most of the boys found joy-
ful. If they wanted a new schoolroom
he told them to go and build it. The boys
learnt the crafts alongside skilled work-
men and became so adept that when a big
bushfire swept through the district a few
years ago they were ready to go out and
rebuild some of the burnt-out houses.
Darling is chairman of the Headmasters’
Conference of Australia.
“Lower Tops’!”: In these days of big
shipping concerns it is rare to hear of
an individual launching out in that line
on. the Australian coast. One who has
done so is Gerald Haynes, Commander
R.A.N., retired, of Melbourne, who last
year built the fine 220-ton auxiliary ketch
Argonaut of hardwood at St. Helens
(Tas.), and who has since engaged in the
general Cargo run to stormlashed King
Island and northern Tassie ports.
Retired first a few months before the
war Haynes bought the small ketch
Defender, and on his first voyage from
Melbourne to St. Helens went ashore at
Tommyhawk Bay. A tug called to the
scene dragged her off, but later, while
reloading the jettisoned cargo, a gale
came up and the ketch snapped her cable
and went on the beach again. Abandoned
by tlje underwriters, the wreck was pur-
chased by W. Tucker, a sawmiller,
of St. Helens, for whom Haynes ultimately
refloated the vessel and sailed her around
to Georges Bay. Then the war inter-
vened, during which Haynes collected a
D.S.C. with the “Scrap-iron Flotilla” in
the Med. Today Tucker is Haynes’s
partner in his new ship.'
Dead in Hobart, at 57, William Edward
Brooker, Treasurer and Minister for
Transport in the Tasmanian Government.
Born in London, he became an engineer,
served with the Imperial forces in the
First World War and came to Australia
soon afterwards. He was elected M.H.A.
for Franklin in 1934 and became Chief
Secretary and Minister for Transport in
1939 ; four years later he was switched
to the Lands and Works portfolio. At the
1946 elections he topped the poll for
Franklin, and when Robert Cosgrove
resigned last December pending a Royal
Commission into charges of corruption
he became Premier, relinquishing the post
to Cosgrove after his acquittal.
Into the Silence;
In U.S.A., at 84, Charles Warren Nash, of
motor fame, credited with having introduced
in 1900 the straight-line conveyor-belt assembly-
system in car production. He was associated
with Durant-Dort cars and Buicks before found-
ing his own firm in 1917.
In Sydney, at 63, George Sorlie, whose travel-
ling theatrical company was formerly well-
known in country towns throughout New South
Wales and Queensland. For the last three
years he had been engaged in a building pro-
ject, the Village of Sorlie, in French’s Forest,
near Sydney.
At Queanbeyan, at 71, Alexander George
Allman Powell, grazier, of Wauna Wauna,

Women's Letters
From Melbourne
The concert given for the Royal Mel-
bourne Hospital Appeal Funds was a
triumph for Hephzibah Menuhin, Profes-
sor Bernard Heinze and the members of
the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.
Fady Dugan was accompanied by Mrs.
J. O. Haselden, With the Chief Justice,
Sir Edmund Herring, was Lady Herring,
who was a vice-president of the concert
committee, and Sir Thomas Nettlefold,
the acting Lord Mayor. Hephzibah wore
a bouffant gown of shell-pink net, the
bodice featuring a bertha collar, which
also formed the dainty cap sleeves. Con-
veners of the concert, Mesdames George
Armstrong and Sidney Baillieu Myer, sat
in the official enclosure. Recently re-
turned from England was Mrs. J. V. Fair-
bairn, wearing a floral gown under grey-
fox furs. The Duchess of Grafton wore
a striking black-lace gown under a mink
coat. With Mrs. Andrew Chirnside was
her daughter Jennifer, and sitting with
Mrs. Bernard Heinze was the manager
of the A.B.C. in this city, Conrad Charl-
ton, and Mrs. Charlton. The concert
was a great financial as well as artistic
success —a cheque for £3OOO was handed
over to the hospital by the conveners.
A number of pretty mannequins proved
their indifference to Melbourne’s mid-
winter weather by going down to the sea
to be photographed in the glamorous
fashions that will adorn the beaches when
the languorous long days are with us
again. Created by Cole of California,
these beach styles were in printed cottons
and jersey. There was even glamor for
the O.S. figure—one very svelte swimsuit
and matching coolie-length coat in black
silk jersey will make the large woman
smart on the beach. Stripes, coin-spots
and floral prints will be popular. One-
piece swimsuits are fashioned of shark-
skin lastex. The two-piece lastex variety
are styled with a new uplift brassiere top ;
some feature a trim uplift bra. top and
pants fitting neatly into the waist with a
new-shaped waistband. One mother-and-
daughter twosome was in white cotton
printed with blue bonnets. Both suits
had fitted tops shirred with elastic and
tiny ballerina skirts. Beach dresses are
featuring the ballerina skirt, and one, in
crisp white cotton, had a red-and-white
checkerboard design. The bodice of this
frock, as was the case in most of the new
styles, was shirred with elastic. The
coolie coat for wear on the beach is
longer than that of last year; new also
are the silk and cotton frocks which can
be “dressed up” for beach cocktail and
dance parties.
Benno Moiseiwitsch, whom musical
Melbourne regards with the affection due
to an old friend, gave proof at his open-
ing Town Hall recital that his hands have
lost none of their magic. As always,
announcement of his coming brought
lovers of the piano flocking. Mrs. Frank
Tait’s pastel-blue lace gown had the
pattern of the three-tiered skirt outlined
with colored sequins. With her father,
John Tait, sat Mrs. Tom Mitchell, whose
black gown was covered with a fur coat.
Mrs. Carl Raridall was smart in b*ack.
Mrs. T. Alan Mackay added a dyed-
ermine > coat to her gown of dusty-pink
crSpe. Mrs. W. Purves, whose brown-
fur coat was worn with a small blue hat
covered with blue veiling, was accom-
panied by her daughter, Mrs. Yott Mur-
ray, of Adelaide, whose hyacinth-blue
woollen coat was topped with a matching
hat trimmed with a brown ostrich-feather
mount. With Dr. Bryan Keon Cohen
was his wife, whose garnet-red velvet
dinner-gown was worn under a fur coat.
Lelie Potter, who combined black taffeta
ballerina frock and fur bolero, was
accompanied by Mrs. Jimmy Coles, of
Sydney. Mrs. Ron Findlay wore a mid-
night-blue crepe gown, the bodice of
which was banded with copper-toned
sequins. Among pianists who admired
Moiseiwitsch’s art were Vera Bradford,
Viva Holgate Clarke and Lindsay Big-
gins, whose attractive wife wore a tailored
coat in tomato-red velvet.
The premiere of “Mourning Becomes
Electra,” despite that it took place when
there hung over the streets the pall of a
dense fog and intense cold, brought en-
thusiasts out at 6.15 p.m. clad in evening-
gowns and with colorful feather- and
flower-trimmings in their hair. Very wel-
come at the half-hour interval was the
hot coffee, tea or chocolate served with
sandwiches. Mr. and Mrs. Garnet Car-
roll entertained a number of their friends
to a similar repast in the former’s office,
Mrs, Carroll was in an ankle-length black
cr€pe frock and smart little chapeau
fashioned of bows of wide taffeta rib-
bon striped in black and gold. Mrs. Der-
mot Connelly, who, with her husband
and children, have moved up from Frank-
ston to live in Sir Raymond Connelly’s
South Yarra house for a few months, was
in black wool and silver-fox furs'. She
was with her sister, Mrs, Frank May,
enveloped in a lovely fur coat, and Mrs.
Dan Reddan, also in black frock and
silver-fox cape. Mrs. Colin Chisholm, of
Khancoban, Upper Murray, wore an
ankle.-length dinner frock of black taffeta.
Her natty little hat was just a side cluster
of large roses in water-lily-green tonings.
Mrs. Norman Spry’s ankle-length black-
tulle skirt worn over pink satin was allied
to a bodice of black velvet.
Hephzibah Menuhin, who generously
offered to take Eileen Joyce’s place at
the keyboard for the concert with the
orchestra, also substituted as joint guest-
of-honor with Professor Bernard Heinze
at the late-afternoon party given by
Mesdames George Armstrong and Sidney
Baillieu Myer at the latter’s Toorak
home. Mrs, Baillieu Myer, who was
assisted by her daughter Marigold in
caring for the guests, wore an ensemble
of soft caramel-toned crepe. The frock
had narrow satin revers, and a wide satin
band edged the apron front of the slim
skirt. The matching felt hat was of the
new flat-beret type and had a small
cluster of beige and brown feathers at
the side. Hephzibah Menuhin chose a
simply-cut short-sleeved black dress and
a bonnet-shaped black felt hat which had
a ruching of grosgrain ribbon on the
edge. Mrs. Bernard Heinze’s black
jacket-suit featured a knife-pleated skirt;
to her ensemble she added a blue-fox
collar and muff and a small black hat
finished with a high feather quill in
front. Mrs. George Armstrong chose
black, highlighted with a corsage of
gardenias ; a spray of ospreys trimmed
her hat. Her daughter, the Hon. Mrs. W.
Vestey, was in brown ; the frock showing
a collar of dusty pink and her hat
trimmed with coq feathers in brown and
dusty pink.
Most of the modish hats worn at the
party were feather-trimmed. Mrs. C. S.
Steele’s black hat had a chou of deep
creamy coq feathers set in front. Match-
ing feathers comprised the embellishment
to Mrs. Rupert Downes’s cherry-red felt
hat. Lady Fraser’s black hat dripped
black ospreys at one side. Mrs. Geoffrey
Whitehead’s hat of pinky-beige had a
chou of soft matching ostrich feathers
set in front, Mrs. S, Kimpton’s brown
tam-o’-shanter had a long, curved
pheasant feather for trimming. Lady
Herring, Lady Gullett and her daughter
Mrs. Sue Odell, Mr. and Mrs. W. Rus-
sell Clarke, Mrs. J. Fitzgerald, Mrs.
Essington Lewis and her daughter Helen,
Mrs. Edmund Alcock, the Victor Hurleys
and the Russell Grimwades were there
to do honor to two distinguished people
in Melbourne’s musical life.
The lovely subject of this portrait is
18-year-old June Collis, the youngest
member of the Independent Theatre Com-
pany, who got her first chance to appear
in “The Little Foxes” while understudy-
ing the role of Alexandra. As proof of
her versatility she sang the leading role
in “The Beggar’s Opera” last year. June
has risen rapidly in the profession during
her two years on the stage. She is a
great favorite with the rest of the com-
pany.
A family dinner party at the Windsor
Hotel was given by Mr. and Mrs. John
S. Shilliday, of St. Helens, Mildura, to
celebrate the engagement of their younger
daughter Anne to Frank Clarke, Anne
is in residence at Janet Clarke Hall and
is doing her last year of Commerce at
the University. Her fiance, who is study-
ing accountancy, is the only son of the
Rev. and Mrs, W. Lansdell Clarke, of
Toorak.
From Sydney
The pleasant home of the James Arch-
holds, one of the most gracious spots
in Trafalgar-avenue, Roseville, became
a home indeed for young girls of Legacy
last Saturday afternoon. The house,
which was bequeathed to Legacy by the
late James Archbold, is already occupied
by 18 girls from the country who are
continuing their education in Sydney.
Some will attend the University, some are
here to follow up and round-off their
education and training in subjects which
they cannot complete in the country.
Already Legacy has spent about £3OOO on
the house, which is a spacious one-storey
building. Thdre are three dormitories,
lots of showers and every modern con-
venience. And there’s a garden in smiling
condition, and in it no fewer than 300
varieties of roses —not all blooming at
present.
Legatees had a grand time on Satur-
day afternoon when the home was offici-
ally opened by the Governor, Lieut.-
General John Northcott. President of
Legacy, Marcus Griffin, president of
the committee administering the home,
J. L. Jamieson, and other members
of committee escorted the Governor
to the verandah where the speeches
were made. Admiral Moore was
there, and General Berryman, and the
band of the Eastern Command played in
spirited style. The Mayor and Mayoress
of Kuringai (Mr. and Mrs. J. H.
Brown), the Mayor and Mayoress of
Willoughby, Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Durant,
chairman of Red Cross Clack and Mrs.
Clack (and you should see the piles of
sheets and towels and household linen
the Red Cross has given to the home!)
were among the many who listened to the
speeches, saw the Governor unveil the'
memorial plaque and the little ceremony
when the girls now resident in the home
were presented to his Excellency. Then
everybody had tea, if they were official,
in the reception-room or in the marquee
in the grounds.
Rowe is getting to know her
Australia. With Breffni Hosking as
associate artist, Rosemary Gill as accom-
panist, Thea has been touring Queens-
land: not only Brisbane but Gympie,
Maryborough and Toowoomba, In
Sydney last week Thea entertained the
Killara Music Club, and by the time
you read this she will be in Mel-
bourne presenting her programme of
British traditional songs. In Melbourne
the trio give two recitals for the British
Music Society in the society’s club rooms
in Collins-street. Public recitals and per-
formances at schools will keep them busy
the rest of the time.
Before the war (1939 issue) the Inter-
national Ball shone like a crystallised
cherry on the confection of Sydney’s
dancing season. Now the United Nations
Association, whose funds benefit by the
ball, is planning a spectacular comeback
for this event. On July 1 the Trocadero
will burgeon with flags—flags of every
nation. They will flutter in friendly
fashion in the foyer of the Trocadero,
and breathe amity from the many diplo-
matic and Consular tables, giving color to
the ballroom. More color, too, will be
splashed on the night by many national
costumes. There will be a floor-show
featuring traditional dances of different
lands, including one of classic Greece.
And the committee has sent an invitation
to Larry and Vivien Olivier. The
Francis Anderson lady is president of the
ball, the secretary of which is Mrs.
W. S. Seymour. There is an enthusiastic
young U.N.O. group, and they plan a
cocktail party with a buffet of all Inter-
national dishes for next Saturday. Funds
will help the ball expenses.
Mary Wootton, ‘‘Miss New Zealand,”
is having a grand time in London, where
she has gone as a guest of the Royal
Society of St. George. Australian star
John McCallum partnered Mary in her
screen-test at Highbury Studio. Mary
Wootton was chosen out of 250 con-
testants to represent “Miss New Zealand,”
and to accept the thanks of Britain for
the generosity shown during the past nine
years by fellow-Maorilanders. She spent
her first week-end in England exploring
the Thames Valley, all soft and green
with spring. She lunched at the famed
inn “The Compleat Angler.” With
Phyllis Calvert she saw her first London
premiere, “Broken Journey.” Here she
met Britain’s Foreign Secretary, Ernest
Bevin.
When Lord Cowrie was Governor-
General, Lute Drummond helped with
many musical functions arranged by
Lady Gowrie. The then Governor-
General’s lady also took keen interest in
Lute’s pupil, Joan Hammond. A week
or so ago Mrs. Hope Gibson, of Killara,
received a note from Windsor Castle
wishing the Lute Drummond Testimonial
Memorial every success and enclosing
Lady Cowrie’s cheque for £5. Mrs.
Gibson, who is not a member of the
committee though she is very interested
in the fund, has forwarded the cheque
to president Florence Taylor.
Flocks of country people came to town
for the wedding of Clare Byrnes, of
Rimini, Manilla, and Robert Fagan, of
Tamworth. The two were married in St.
Mary’s Cathedral last Tuesday night, and
the reception was at Amory, Ashfield.
The bride’s frock and veil were a swirling
mist of embroidered white georgette and
tulle. Her three ’maids wore frocks of
almond-green georgette and head-dresses
of pink and green hyacinths. Father S.
O Brien came from Manilla to perform
the ceremony. Much admired was the
bride’s string of pearls, the gift of her
father.
The Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron
was founded in 1862, and the hoary old
sailer is having a birthday party on July
16. This will commence at six o’clock
and end at nine, and as the -circular
says: “After 9 p.m. the usual Club Ser-
vices will be available.” That’s the
frivolous side of the picture. But it has
also been decided to compile and publish
a history of the squadron. The committee
hopes that members possessing family
records, letters, logs and so on dealing
with personal experiences will make such
records available. Personal recollections
of outstanding events under R.S.Y.S.
Burgee will be welcomed.
Joan Sutherland, dramatic soprano,
left off work for a few minutes one after-
noon last week to tell of her singing, and
her ambition, which, of course, is to
finish her studies abroad. Joan was one
of the finalists in the recent A.B.C. vocal
and concerto contests, and a crowded
Town Hall heard the promise of her
clear young voice, in company with the
Symphony Orchestra directed by Eugene
Goossens, in Elizabeth’s Greeting from
“Tannhauser.” But Sydney concertgoers
already knew this singer from her work
with the Singers of Australia. On one
remembered S.O.A. programme she sang
Senta’s Ballad from “The Flying Dutch-
man.” She is known to A.B.C. radio
listeners. She has sung in the S.O.A.’s
Eastwood branch production of Handel’s
“Acis and Galatea,” and in Purcell’s
“Dido and .Eneas.” Norton Trevaire

The new game in the city is compar-
ing seats for the opening nights of the
Old Vic. season. The people who man-
aged to secure the blessed bits of card-
board look upon them as a successful
sprinter might regard his silver cup. All
recipients wear an air of pride as over
some noble achievement. Lots of new
frocks will get a first airing at the
premiere of “School for Scandal,” and
daddy doesn’t know it, but his cheque-
book is in for almost a k.o. in a fight to
a finish with platina, mink or silver fox.
In the meantime the Oliviers (Olivyas or
Ofiviahs, according to your school of
pronunciation) are holidaying in Queens-
land, and should arrive in Sydney about
the 27th of the month. Philip Lee, of the
British Council, and Elsie Bayer have
been halving a swim around the house-
agencies looking for a suitable residence,
house preferred to flat, for Larry and
Vivien. Up to writing nothing had been
found.
Newly engaged is Gay Bernays, only
daughter of the G. C. A. Bernays couple
of Vaucluse. Young man is Bob Brad-
shaw, only son of the A. V. Bradshaws,
of Dover Heights. The two celebrated
with a party at . Romano’s recently.
Gay’s father and mother are serv-
ing cocktails with a flourish at Usher’s
Hotel early next month.
The veterinary profession was well to
the fore at the wedding at St. Stephen’s
of Betty Maiden, elder daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. H. E. Maiden, and Alfred
Green, only child of Mr. and Mrs. S.
Green, of Christchurch, N.Z. Betty is
junior house surgeon at Sydney Univer-
sity veterinary clinic ; her bridegroom is
completing his studies in the same science.
The English-Speaking Union proudly
proclaims a silver jubilee, and is busy
celebrating in style for the great date. A
reception at the Australia on a grand
scale was held last night.

Australia’s life offices, of which the
99-year-old A.M.P., with assets totalling
over £lB2 millions, is the- oldest and
largest, represent a system of collective
security which provides both a sheet-
anchor in the realm of domestic finance
and a stabilising factor in the economic
and social structure. The system has with-
stood the tests of time, including two
world-wide depressions and two world
wars ; and the offices cater for a wide
variety of personal wants and needs out-
side the range of social-security legisla-
tion.
Public recognition of these facts, com-
bined with “full” employment, inflation
(which has had the effect of lowering an
assured’s life cover) and the popularity
of subsidised staff superannuation
schemes, show up in the society’s latest
accounts in a record volume of new busi-
ness and income. And the low cost of
collecting income and managing the big
investment portfolio, the solid nature of
assets, the comfortable margins in all
matters upon which soundness and pro-
gress depend, regular and satisfactory
bonuses paid, the haven of refuge the co.
has been for many of its policyholders in
time of need have all combined to
win it a high reputation among
life offices.
New business put on the books last
term was £61,520,555 (up £3,089,025) —
ordinary £53,270,494 (up £5,062,965) and
industrial £8,250,061 (down £073,940).
Contraction of the industrial figure fol-
lowed discontinuance, in common with
other life offices, of writing of new en-
dowment contracts in that department of
less than 25 years’ duration ; this because
of the Government’s cheap-money policy
and consequent shrinkage in interest earn-
ings. The year’s new ordinary business
was nearly 2J times greater than the 1939
figure, and about 76 p.c. of it was written
in Australia, 21 p.c. New Zealand and
the other 3 p.c. in Britain and else-
where.
In the two departments combined, gross
income (before deducting income and
land taxes, £510,175) was £2,006,529
stronger at £23,574,562. After paying all
legitimate claims and exes., £10,193,557
remained, of which £128,453 was used
to write, down the book value of assets.
The remaining £10,066,104 was added to
the assurance funds, raising them to
'£174,072,816. This exceeded actuarial
liabilities under policies (the amount, on
a net premium basis at 2\ p.c. interest,
necessary to meet future claims as they
arise) by £5,209,951. Of this last-
mentioned amount, £4,056,707 was distri-
buted as bonuses among policyholders—
there are no shareholders —at the same
rates as for the previous year. The other
£1,153,244 was held as a special reserve
against actuarial contingencies. In addi-
tion to all this there are general invest-
ment and contingency reserves totalling
£4,250,000, making total accumulated
funds £178,322,876 It is a very strong
position.
The reason for putting large sums to
reserves, instead of immediately distribut-
ing them as bonuses, is mainly to protect
future bonus-paying capacity against the
effects of cheap money and inflation —
a policy with which discerning policy-
holders will not quarrel, because bonuses
are a protection, or partial protection,
against future inflation. If benefits at
maturity on a with-profits contract are
to exceed the amount paid as premiums,
interest earned on the premiums must
cover the death risk and all exes, associ-
ated with the contract during its duration,
as well as provide a margin for bonuses.
The Australian type of bonus scale re-
quires a rapid release of surplus as the
age of the policy increases. This need is
met by a low rate of valuation, which
locks up in the early years sums which
would otherwise become available for
distribution and releases them with in-
terest later on.
Reduction of the co.’s valuation rate
of interest from 3 p.c. to 2\ p.c. was
carried to an advanced stage last term.
Over 97 p.c. of actuarial liabilities are
now valued on the more Stringent basis.
Only assurances with deferred participa-
tion in bonuses —they amount to less than
£5,000,000 —are still valued on a 3 p.c.
basis. The gross rate of interest earned
on total mean funds last year was £3
16s, 3d. p.c. (down Is. 2d. p.c.). The
net rate (after deducting taxes) was £3
10s. sd. p.c. (up sd. p.c.), or. a wink over
1 p.c. above the assumed rate —a healthy
margin for maintenance of compound
reversionary rates. Actually the position
is better than stated, because the net rate
of interest shown has been calculated on
total mean funds, which iilclude
£5,403,244 of reserves of one kind and
another (in addition to net actuarial lia-
bilities). For this and other reasons
rates of interest shown by life offices are
not strictly comparable, one office with
another. Still, it is obvious that
interest rates have been forced down by
Governments to a level where the bless-
ings are no longer unmixed —a fact to
which the “Wild Cat” has been drawing
attention for some time.
Another pleasing feature is the manage-
ment’s tight grip upon controllable exes.
Excluding taxes* exes, in the O.D. took
13.46 p.c. of last year’s net premiums
as against 13.44 p.c. in 1946. In the
I.D. the ratios were 22.69 p.c. and 24.71
p.c. respectively, the drop being due to
the smaller amount of new business
written, for reasons already explained.
They are low rates that compare favor-
ably with any other office and are well
within margins allowed for future exes,
and profits by the actuary.
Another result of cheap money has
been spread of insurance funds into in-
dustry—so far as a restricted field per-
mits —in search of more adequate in-
come. Of the increase of £11,010,405 in
the co.’s holding of public securities last
term, £1,952,002 went into ord. and pref.
shares (£2,200,450), £410,586 into in-
dustrial debentures (£2,063,213), and the
balance into Government and local-gov-
ernment securities, etc. (£139,081,084):

The attractive feature about this co.’s
scrip is the security it offers for both
capital and income ; that is, so far as such
things can be secure in an insecure world.
For such a combination the market
always pays a good price, with a corres-
pondingly low immediate return. Recent
bids of 655. 3d. for the f.-p. pound shares,
visibly covered by 475. 2d. in net tangibles,
failed to bring sellers out of their shells.
The return at 655. 3d. would be 3 p.c.
on a 10 p.c. div. basis, or a shade less
than can be had from Commonwealth
Government stock.
The co. handles paper and printers’
requisites, etc., and has long been a stout
prop to many in the printing trade. Head-
quarters are at Sydney, there are branches
at Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, and a
London subsidiary looks after the buying
end of the business. Also, the manage-
ment, which has grown up in the business,
has exhibited a pleasing aptitude for
adapting itself to changes in the economic
climate.
The ords. got a steady 10 p.c.,
sweetened with £50,000 of bonus scrip
and new issues at par, for the 15 years to
1930. The rate dropped to 5f p.c. for
the next two slump years, and then
climbed by annual steps to 10 p.c. again
in 1939, and has remained steady since.
Finding itself overcapitalised, owing to
slump, the co. returned £368,484 of
capital in 1932-33, but it wasn’t long
(1937) before 53,709 new £1 ords. were
put out, this time at a premium of 10s.
each, to help finance expanding trade.
For similar reasons, 75,139 new ords.,
which carried a premium of 295. each,
were issued, one-for-five, in Dec. last,
raising paid capital to £451,158. The
£109,030 of share premiums was added
to reserves.
Last term saw a “large” expansion of
turnover, to which increased supplies of
paper from Scandinavia contributed.
The dollar scarcity practically cut-off
paper imports from U.S. and Canada, ex-
cepting newsprint, the volume of which
has been greatly reduced. The cautious
board put net earnings at £48,100 (up
£7311), equal to 12.3 p.c. on average
capital employed, or 10.6 p.c. on capital
as it now stands. . And there is more
wheat in the ear than the eye can see.
Profit was written after providing for
taxation, tossing £13,000 from somewhere
into visible accumulations, writing off the
year’s expenditure on fixtures, plant, etc.
(£9209), paying £3500 in retiring allow-
ances, handing £lO,OOO to trustees of a
non-contributory staff fund —a like
amount has gone the same way since the
•close of accounts —and strengthening
inner reserves by an unstated amount. It
is thus difficult to compute the true level
of the co.’s earnings.

an extra £56,657 from outsiders, and
more besides went into stocks (up

Guinea Airways isn’t repaying any of its
capital at present, though the Govern-
ment has taken over its main bread-
winner the Adelaide-Darwin service,
which the co. had pioneered since 1937.
The Government has put blocks to the
wheels of the aircraft it grounded by
refusing permits for any extension of
the South Australian network that is left
to Guinea Airways. Thus the co.’s wings
are clipped and pinioned at a stage when
sky business is really coming into its
own, but the board looks confidently for
a change in Government policy. It esti-
mates that its official competitor is still
operating in deep red, and is “doomed to
failure” largely because it lacks “the sup-
port of the business community, which
contributes the greater proportion of
revenue,”
Meanwhile, Guinea Airways’ activities
are left in a reduced condition for the
second time in its history. Formed 20
years ago as an air-transport service for
the New Guinea goldfields, the co. paid
dividends averaging 25 p.c. for the first-
eight years after making a one-for-three
bonus issue very early in the piece.
When competition took some gloss from
this trade, the Darwin route was de-
veloped as a second string, but became
the main moneyspinner after war shut
down the New Guinea service in 1942.
It’s doubtful whether this service will
ever be resumed, because a war-time road
built to the Lae goldfields allows cheaper
motor transport.
Much of the co.’s N.G. property hav-
ing suffered from enemy action, a damage
claim of £92,499 was admitted by Can-
berra. The board’s conservative policy
in asset-valuation is shown by the “special
depreciation reserve” of over £50,000
which had to be introduced to bridge
the difference between the book-values of
the damaged assets and the Government’s
liability for them:

Liquid strength has been assisted not only
by the war-compensation but by £18,440
paid by Canberra last term for goodwill
of the Darwin service. Though “con-
siderably less than the real value of the
service to the c 0.,” this amount was
probably more than the Government
would have had to pay under a strictly
legalistic interpretation of its own Act.
The present shareholdings mostly com-
prise 20,000 £1 ords. in Australian
National Hotels Pty., which bought the
Wrest Point Hotel, Hobart, last year;
but the board will also seek more profit-
able investment for the £200,000’ now
held in Government bonds, so as to re-
cover some of the revenue lost with the
Darwin service. Gross earnings from
the co.’s smaller activities is expected to
be about £lOO,OOO annually, compared
with the former figure of £250,000. The
board intends to enter still closer liaison
with Australian National Airways Pty.,
to reduce overhead expenses (the two
cos. have ’ already pooled their ground-
staffs at Parafield, South Australia) and
hopes to “continue payment of divi-
dends to both classes of shares.”
Capital is equally divided between
80,000 £1 ords. and a like number of

OUTSTANDING PROGRESS
OF AM P. IN 1947
Chairman's Address at the 99th Annual Meeting
Presenting the 99th Annual Report and Balance
Sheet at the Head Office, 87 Pitt Street, Sydney,
on 4th June, the Deputy-Chairman of Directors,
Sir Frederick H. Tout, gave an encouraging
account of the Society’s continued growth.
New Business, 1947:
Sir Frederick stated that the
total sum assured amounted
to £61,520,000, an all time
record. An interesting point
was that 40% of New
.Iff!
40*
Business written in the Ordin-
ary Department came from
existing policyholders. A
large proportion had also been
drawn from staff superannu-
ation schemes . . . which
represented 31% of last
year’s New Business.
Payments to
Policyholders:
During 1947 the Society had
paid over £9,949,000 to policy-
holders an average of
£27,000 daily! And, since
1939, had paid to the war
bereaved no less a sum than
£5,100,000. The value of life
assurance to the people has
never been more strikingly
vindicated.
Interest Earnings:
In 1946 the rate of interest
realised by the Society was
£3/17/5%. The rate for 1947
was £3/16/3%, as against a
rate of £5/14/11% for 1930.
This reduction in interest
earnings is a feature which
the Society, in common with
other Life Offices, could not
avoid in this era of “cheap
money”. At present, Govern-
ment authorities can, by
direct and indirect monetary
controls, largely influence the
rate of interest earned on
most classes of investment
Mors than
£27.000
a day paid
to members and
their (amides
Total for year
£9.949,000
Investment of Funds:
During the year the Society’s
investment in Preference and
Ordinary Shares was increased
by over £1,869,000 and De-
bentures of Companies by
over £410,000, The holdings
in these investments now
stood at £2,052,000 and
£2,063,000 respectively. The
Society’s investments in Gov-
ernment and Semi-Govern-
ment Loans increased by
£8,647,000 during 1947.
Valuation Basis:
The reduction of the Society’s
valuation rate of interest from
3% to 2Wo had been carried
to a further stage during the
past twelve months, and now
over 97% of the Society’s
liabilities was valued on the
more stringent basis.
Bonus to Policyholders:
Notwithstanding reduction in
interest, bonuses to policy-
holders would be allotted at
the same rate as for the pre-
vious year.

ing prefs,, which are entitled
to advance point - for - point
beyond 7 p.c. with the ords.,
but have so far had no oppor-
tunity to do so. On book-
values, each ord. has net tangible
asset backing of 475. 3d., of
which 265. 3d. is represented by
cash and investments; the
current price of 325. 6d. for this
scrip would provide a yield of
4.3 p.c. if last year’s dividend is
kept up.
Existence of the preference
capital is one of the board’s ad-
mitted reasons for rejecting the
idea of a partial return of
capital. These prefs. don’t par-
ticipate in surplus assets upon a
winding-up, and cannot be re-
paid without the consent of 75
p.c. of their holders, who would
hardly be expected to take re-
payment at par whilst their
cumulative 7 p.c. return is
reasonably secure. At the cur-
rent price of 235. each, the prefs.
yield a shade under 6 p.c. on
their minimum div. basis. The
market’s much lower valuation
of these shares compared with’
the ords. indicates its belief in
an eventual return of capital;
early last year the difference was
less than 2s. 6d,

pected to take five or six months

mine at Marble Bar, about 100
miles away, but it will take time
and money to transfer it and bed
it down. Federal member for
the district and Minister for the
Interior, Vic Johnson, has
promised to assist in obtaining a
Government loan. Most of the
mine employees have been paid
off.
* * * *
Without a discordant note
shareholders of Hill 50 Gold
(W.A.) have agreed to raise
£125,000 of new capital by the
issue of 625,000 4s. shares. It
was announced that £20,000-
worth of Government bonds
would be sold, and the money
used to pay a Is. div., leaving
3s. net to be found by share-
holders oh each of the new issue.
The extra capital is wanted to
buy new plant, deepen the main
shaft and open-up the mine’s
gold carrier at greater depth.

Westralia’s gold industry is
still cursed with a shortage of
firewood. Referring to this at
the annual meeting of the
Chamber of Mines, president
Brinsden said that British labor
had always been loth to furnish
such fuel, which had been mainly
provided by Southern Euro-
peans. Since coal was not avail-
able as a substitute, the only
permanent solution was importa-
tion of more Europeans to re-
place those who had moved to
other parts of the State or re-
turned to their native lands.
VICKERS LIMITED
A YEAR OF PROGRESS
SIR ARCHIBALD JAMIESON’S SPEECH
The Eighty-first Annual General Meeting of Vickers Limited was held
on May 14th In London, England
Sir Archibald Jamieson, the Chairman, in the course of his speech said;
In 1947 Vickers Limited has been faced with many difficulties and you might well
expect a critical or a gloomy speech today. But my story of Vickers in 1947 is quite
the reverse; it has been a year of progress, which includes a geographical spread of
our activities, and a widening in the range of our commercial products. Ihere is
within the Vickers group a great reservoir of technical strength and adaptability, and
it is these qualities which have been responsible for the progrfess and results which
I am able to report.
It is heartening to feel that there is this elasticity and flexibility both in our
own Company, and, I believe, in the British industrial machine generally. I realise
it is impossible to give full rein to this resilient quality in industry in the circum-
stances in which our country is placed as the result of two world wars, in both of
which we played a major part. During those wars we have poured out our great
accumulation of foreign investments, and sacrificed —at least temporarily—a large
percentage of the earnings of foreign exchange from shipping and other services. In
short we have become a debtor instead of a creditor country, and our mode of life has
to be adjusted accordingly: this painful process is in course of being effected. That
British industry has made the great progress it has since the end of the war calls for
praise and encouragement, and does not deserve the criticism which is expressed in
some quarters, and which is liable to convey an inaccurate picture of our achievements
to the Dominions and other friends overseas.
Now for our own affairs; we are well into our stride in our general post-war
programme, and each one of our Subsidiary and Associated Companies has made its
contribution' towards the successful results. I consider the immediate phase of our
post-war programme as being more or less complete, and armament manufacture at
the end of 1947 absorbed only 15 per cent, of productive wages. The number of
employees at the end of 1947 was 74,500 in comparison with the war-time peak of
170,000. 1947 has also been a year of internal re-arrangement and tidying up, for
which we had neither the time nor opportunity during the years of war and the subse-
quent year or two of re-adjustment.
VICKERS-ARMSTRONGS LIMITED
ENGINEERING WORKS AND SHIPYARDS
The reorganisation of our Plants to suit modem conditions and commercial pro-
duction has proceeded during the year; the modernisation of our Shipyard at New-
castle is well advanced, and at Barrow the new cranes serving the building berths are
all in operation. All the progress that circumstances permit of is being made in the
rebuilding of the associated workshops for the extension of out* modern shipbuilding
practices.
The volume of current shipbuilding work at Barrow and Newcastle remains heavy,
and both Yards will continue to be fully occupied for some time to come.
On the Marine Engineering side at Barrow we have completed and delivered
the fleet two pairs of our Vickers-Doxford Engines, and these are operating satis-
factorily in the Elder Dempster ships Accra and Apapa. Other engines of a similar
type have been completed. The Marine Engine Department at Barrow also has a heavy
programme for Steam Turbine propelling machinery and boilers required for the
vessels building at Barrow and Newcastle.
Barrow Works. —In addition to the Marine Engines referred to above, we have
in hand at Barrow a very large order book for Cement Plants for delivery to many
countries. We have also an extensive programme for the manufacture of mechanical
portions of Winders for Gold Mines in South Africa; large contracts have also been
received for Soap-making Machinery and a variety of other general engineering
products; and we have also entered into arrangements for the manufacture of various
types of Diesel Engines for Auxiliary and Traction purposes.
Elswick and Scotswood Works. —A number of Clearing Presses were delivered
during 1947 and a substantial volume of orders remains in hand. We also have a
large volume of contracts for Printing Presses of the offset type of the George Mann
design, and have made arrangements for the manufacture of other types of Printing
Presses which are eminently suitable work for both Elswick and Scotswood. In
addition, we ‘have going through the Shops a great variety of general engineering
products.
Southern Works. —We have received at both Crayford and Dartford large con-
tracts from Powers Accounting Machines Ltd., and the demand for our Boxmaking
Machinery and Metal Office Equipment continues to be large; we have achieved a
record output in each of these productions, and our order book remains heavy. The
acquisition of Keenok and Worssam, which specialise respectively in paint-making
machinery and brewery machinery, has brought a substantial volume of work to our
Southern Works, and production is proceeding smoothly.
AIRCRAFT SECTION
During the past twelve months sales of the Viking have, continued, but for the
next year or two production at Weybridge will be concentrated on the Valetta, the
sister aircraft for Transport Command, and for which substantial Government orders
have been received. The contract for the building of two Viscount prototypes remains
with us, and it is hoped to fly the first of these very shortly.
During 1947 Supermarine have continued a steady output of Seaflre 47 and Spitfire
24 aircraft for the Government. Our single-jet fighter, the “Attacker,” the standard
model, carrying full military equipment, raised the World record for the 100 kilo-
metre international closed circuit by 22 m.p.h. There are good prospects that an
order for a number of “Attackers” will shortly be received from the Ministry of
Supply. The “Attacker” has also been demonstrated in many foreign countries, and,
in a number of cases, this has resulted in requests for quotations.
OTHER SUBSIDIARY AND ASSOCIATED COMPANIES
Production is being extended in directions which it is anticipated will lead to
expansion of the business of/ English Steel Corporation and its Subsidiaries in special-
ised steel products, such as large back-up rolls, castings for rolling stock and locos,
oil-well specialties and engineers’ tools. Two of the major schemes are concerned with'
the manufacture of railway tyres and axles and stainless steel sheets.
Taylor Brothers have been very fully employed in producing record quantities of
railway wheels, tyres and axles; Darlington Forge has been occupied to capacity on
marine castings and forgings; Firth-Vickers Stainless Steels has also had a busy
year and improved on its previous record of production, maintaining its position as
the largest producer of stainless steel in Great Britain.
The Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company has had a satisfactory
year. Though the Company has continued to make important contributions to the
supply of coal wagons for this country and third-class coaches for the Home Railways,
large numbers of railway vehicles for Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Rhodesia, Egypt
and Crown Colonies are planned for production this year, and it is hoped that the
for its products both at home and abroad, and an increase in turnover was again
The Ship-repairing and Dry Dock capacity of Palmers Hebbum Company Limited
has been kept fully occupied on reconversion of ships in addition to routine work,
and bookings ahead will keep the capacity well occupied. The Constructional Steel
Department now has the full use of its reconstructed premises and facilities.
Cooke, Troughton & Simms Limited specialises in the development and construc-
tion of advanced Mathematical Instruments for geodesy, and Optical Instruments
for industrial and biological research. The Works through its world-wide sales organi-
sation is steadily increasing its overseas business. Orders for civil instruments from
overseas during 1947 amounted to 70 per cent, of the whole.
Loco Limited had a successful year, and continues to experience a good demand
for its products both at home and abroad, and an increase in turnover was again
achieved. The development of Silicone treated glass fabrics is proving a useful
addition to the range of electrical insulating materials in special cases where high
temperature resistance is an advantage.
Robert Boby Limited has had a satisfactory year, and continual research and
review of the industries they supply is resulting in a steady improvement in their
products and a wider application of these for malting, seed cleaning, as well as
conveying equipment. Bobys have work in hand for the African Groundnut Scheme
and also for film production.
The products of G. J. Worssam & Son Limited are complementary to those of
Robert Boby Limited in Brewery Equipment. The association of these two companies
has already proved mutually beneficial in many aspects of their development and
progress. We regard the future with optimism and are taking further energetic
action to increase as rapidly as possible our export trade, this drive already showing
success.
On Ist August 1947 we acquired the whole of the share capital of George Mann
& Co. (1932) Ltd., Lithographic Printing Machinery Manufacturers of Leeds and
London. This Company specialises in the manufacture of Lithographic Printing
Machines, and our Elswick and Scotswood Works is now producing more offset
machines than any other lithographic printing machinery manufacturers in the world.
PROSPECTS
I do not think that under existing conditions Stockholders will expect more than
a general indication of the probable position of their Company at the end of 1948.
During 1947 various factors contributed to exceptional results: for instance, there
was the bringing into account of the final settlement of some outstanding w r ar con-
tracts, and the charge for taxation has been reduced mainly on account of the
alteration in the method of calculation which is explained in the accounts. These
were factors which tended to make the results for 1947 unreliable for purposes of
comparison. So far as prospects are concerned for 1948 I shall confine myself to
saying that if existing conditions are maintained we should be able to pay the same
dividend as we did for 1947, but the margin over these dividend requirements seems
likely to be reduced.
The report was adopted.

SUNDRY SHOWS
Loxton's Watercolors.
Watercolors by John Loxton
at the Grosvenor Galleries,
Sydney, range from sea-pieces to
a drover travelling sheep through
a pleasing golden haze, and in-
clude snow, sunlit gums, valleys,
a warmly-tinted bridge in Tas-
mania, Mt. Buffalo, and surf
fishermen at Narooma: a
broadly representative cross-
section of a country, particularly
interesting—because the subject
is not often attempted—in the
snow-scenes.
Loxton’s method, at its best,
is seen in “Snow and Silence,” in
which the firm saplings in the
foreground are contrasted with
the softness of the snow. As a
method it has limitations. One
does not —as in certain European
paintings of snow, for instance
Neogrady’s—receive an impres-
sion of cold might, but there
are, nevertheless, delicacy, sound
craftsmanship, a fleeting lumi-
nosity and a kind of minor style.
Vigor and depth are lacking.
A similar lack of force is
noticeable in the other types of
landscape.
Though nearly all are pleasant
there are honorable excep-
tions. “Storm Clouds,” for in-
stance, rather in the style of
some of the 18th-century
English landscapists, is dramatic
with its towering clouds, its
windswept corner of blue sky
and its lightly-touched, com-
petent landscape darkening in
the outlined forms of cattle.
“Impending Storm, Narooma,”
a fairly large watercolor with a
purplish sea and dark coast, was
bought by the N.S.W. National
Gallery. Its main value—apart
from sound craftsmanship—lies
in dramatically spurting spray.
Here again, another sea-piece,
closely following it in design and
intention, fails. The droving
picture is large, well-drawn,
warm and a little empty.
Felton Bequest.
Chemist Alfred Felton’s latest
posthumous benefaction to the
National Gallery in Melbourne
comprises £35,000 - worth of
paintings, drawings, sculpture,
furniture and bronzes.
From the point of view of
size Nicholas Poussin’s 1 “Passage
of the Red Sea” (£17,500) is the
most important. An immense
black cloud dominates the land-
scape and dwarfs Moses and the
hosts of Israel crowding on the
foreshore. It is a typical period
subject picture painted by one
of the last of the French classic
painters, and is interesting as
the tail-end of a great tradition
shortly to be engulfed, like the
Egyptian Army, by the Impres-
sionists, Post - Impressionists,
futurists, dadaists, cubists and
their ilk.
The Gainsborough seascape
“Mouth of the Thames”
(£11,250) is not far short of the
Poussin in the matter of size,
but is not so good as might
have been expected from an
artist whose chief interest was
landscape, and who only painted
portraits under duress. A head
of Rabindranath Tagore by
Epstein is in that sculptor’s
realistic manner. It is difficult
to know why the Felton bought
the lifeless-looking boy with the
beetroot face and hands by
Modigliani.
* * * *
' The technical skill that has
been put into Charles Wheeler’s
nudes, portraits and landscapes
at Melbourne Athenaeum hasn’t
produced flesh that looks like
flesh or water that looks like
water. The large “Hawkesbury
River,” suave as it is, hasn’t the
accent of nature ; it looks tired.
Some of Wheeler’s earlier land-
scape sketches look much
fresher.
* * * *
Mary Mac Queen (George’s
Gallery, Melbourne) is another
exponent of the dustbin school
of painting. Titles are indicative
—“Melbourne ' Ruin,” “Plaster
Mosaic,” “Stone Decay,” “Mel-
bourne’s Back Door,” “Back-
yards Carlton,” “Melbourne
Backyard.” “Flagon and
Fruit” and “Studio Shelf” are
freer, and in “Old Jetty, Phillip
Island,” she has got some of the
glitter of the sunlight on the
water creeping up the vista of
piles.

The N. S. Wales Royal Art
Society’s exhibition of oils and

David Jones Gallery in the

"Mourning Becomes
Electro."
“Cauboy”; While I have the
greatest admiration for the
genius of Eugene O’Neill and
the ability of Doris Fitton and
Elaine Foster to maintain a
superlative pitch of emotion
from 6.15 to 11.30 p.m. at the
Princess, Melbourne, I sincerely
hope and trust that other play-
wrights won’t get it into their
heads to write tragedies of five
hours’ duration.
O’Neill says all he has to say
on the Electra complex in the
first 45 minutes of his opus, just
as Nicholas Poussin says all he
has to say in one square foot of
canvas in the lefthand corner
of his immense “Crossing of the
Red Sea”—recently bought for
£17,500 by the Felton Bequest —
and he doesn’t say as much as
Corot says in his tiny “Bent
Tree.”
The O’Neill play is described
as having been borrowed from
/Eschylus’s “Oresteia,” and it is
expressed very much in Freud’s
terms. The author doesn’t
merely tell a pretty or unpretty
story; he shows the conflict
which exists between Lavinia’s
beliefs and feelings. Th;e
moment she draws from her
brother a certain gesture she
recoils in revulsion. O’Neill
shows that it is her feelings that
have produced the gesture, and
that it is her reviewal of those
feelings which produces the
revulsion.
The play is really three plays,
and there is a poisoning in the
first, a murder and suicide in the'
second and a suicide and hint
of murder in the third ; but they
all deal with the same problem
ol the conflict between beliefs
and feelings, and it is the nega-
tive attitude which is expressed
all through—the positive is never
touched on. That is what makes
the trilogy ultimately so depres-
sing in spite of the excellent
acting of Miss Fitton, Bruce
Beeby and Elaine Foster, which,
in the case of Miss Foster, meant
a sustained display through 13
acts of frustration and insensate
hatred.
* * * ♦
Murder most foul is being per-
petrated at Sydney Conserva-
torium, but the flashing of dirks
—wielded respectively by John
Dudley as Turiddu and David
Barwell as Alfio in “Cavalleria
Rusticana,” and by Geoffrey
Moore as Canio in “I Pagliacci,”
the brace of one-acters produced
at the Con. by Hilda Mulligan
for the Con. Opera School
under the baton of Florent
Hoogstoel—is done, thanks to
Messrs. Mascagni and Leon-
cavallo, very melodiously. The
best feature of the musical
murders is the surprisingly good
standard of histrionics as well as
of singing attained by the prin-
cipals.

The J.C.W. grand opera
season opens in Melbourne on
August 14 with the usual spec-
tacular bang in the traditional
“Aida.” “Carmen,” “II Trova-
tore,” “Cavalleria,” “Pagliacci,”
“Andre Chenier,” “Don Gio-
vanni,” “La Boheme,” “The
Barber,” “Butterfly,” “Otello,”
“Rigoletto,” “Tosca,” “Faust,”
“Lucia,” “Traviata,” “Turan-
dot,” “Manon” (Massenet) and
“Tales of Hoffman” will follow.
The only debutante in the pro-
cession is “Otello,” Verdi’s last
and said to be his greatest.

By Terence. Rattigan out of
the Archer-Shee Case, “The
Winslow Boy” is currently doing
a sparkling gallop at Sydney
Minerva. The story recalls the
legend about th& righteous
gentleman who fought as high
as the Privy Council on whether
or not he’d paid a penny ferry
fare. In “The Winslow Boy,”
a naval cadet is wrongly accused
by the Admiralty of the petty
theft of five shillings and ex-
pelled from a naval academy.
After two years of heartbreaking
struggle by his father he is
cleared in a public hearing of the
Admiralty’s charge. John
Meillon, the boy, and Richard
Parry, as the father, give excel-
lent performances.
Sydney Tiv.’s Current bill—it’s
a good ’un —is built around
American comedian Ben Blue, a
blue-chinned, slightly balding
comic who eases himself into the
programme like a gentle breeze
and works up to something like
hurricane force before the
night’s doings are over with ec-
centric dancing, a lively patter
studded with innuendoes and
straight clowning. Some further
clowning by Tandy ; the dazzling
acrobatics of Warren, Latona
and Sparks'; silhouettes cast by
the hands of Vivian Sanderson;
and Will Duffy, who rides
everything from a bicycle to
almost no bike at all, top off an
excellent bill.
"Hamlet."
Olivier’s “Hamlet” film, at
Melbourne Athenaeum, is diffi-
cult to assess; but so, of course,
is Shakspeare’s play.
Was Hamlet mad, pretending
to be mad, or only half-
mad? Laurence Olivier seems
to make him half - mad,

The British Labour Minister, in intro-
ducing the “1946 Assurance Companies
Act,” stated that “The 1946 Act”: —
“Acknowledges the inherently in-
ternational and comprehensive char-
acter of insurance.”
The Labour President of the Board of
Trade in the House of Commons also
stated that it would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, lie
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business
by private enterprise. It is, he stated,
the desire of the Government that Insur-
ance should be, in the future, as in the
past, dealt with on an international basis
and as business of an international

Joseph Priestley, Yorkshireman. Doctor of Divinity,
theologian and pamphleteer, owes his fame to chemical dis-
coveries made in his leisure hours as a relaxation from writing
sermons and political broadsheets. His first success as a
practical chemist was the accidental discovery of soda water.
While living next door to a brewery in Leeds, curiosity led
him to investigate the process of brewing. In doing so, he
found that carbon dioxide gas, which is produced during the
brewing of malt beverages, could be dissolved in ordinary
water to make "aerated water.” The success of this experi-
ment set him on his chemical career and he acquired a renown
which matched his considerable reputation as a theologian.
His appointment as librarian to Lord Shelburne at Bowood
in 1773 gave him ample time and opportunity to develop his
scientific hobbies and his most important work was done
during the following eight years. In this period he discovered,
prepared and studied a vast number of gases—all of them
highly important—including oxygen, ammonia, nitrous oxide
(the "laughing gas” of the dentist’s surgery), hydrogen
sulphide, hydrogen chloride and sulphur dioxide. Priestley’s
inventive genius was of a type that is typically British. As
a practical experimenter he has had few,
if any, equals, and the gases he discoVered
have proved' of immense scientific and com-
mercial importance. He died in 1804 in
Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Although, from the viewpoint of
accommodation, transport and other
facilities, Moorefield hath very few
charms to soothe the savage punter,
meetings on the hilly little Kogarah
track are nevertheless always interest-
ing. On this unique hillside layout
with its tight circuit, sharply rising
back-stretch and down-hill finish, the
always-useful “horses - for - courses”
maxim becomes the consideration in
trying to “pick ’em.”
Punters . didn’t have much scope
for applying the rule to the first
half of the S.T.C.’s programme on
Saturday, fields for four restricted
events including only two horses that
had won on the course, but the
main double of Flying and June
Handicaps went to proved Moorefield
horses. Heavy scratchings reduced
the Flying field to six, and Yankee
Lad, leniently handicapped at 7.11
and with W. Cook aboard, won com-
fortably from Mirrigen and Captivate.
Yankee Lad clocked 1.16 —much the
best time recorded in the five races
run over the six-furlongs trip on the
day.
The S.T.C. recently warned a num-
ber of bookies that they were doing
insufficient business to warrant their
continuance; it’s a pity the club hasn’t
also offered some advice regarding
the miserable odds offered by Sydney
bookmakers. Yankee Lad was
favorite for the Flying at threes;
Mirrigen was the “rank outsider” at
11 to 2 —more the sort of odds one
would expect at a bush picnic meet-
ing than op a metropolitan race-
course.
* • • •
The 10-furlongs June Handicap
went to the Ajax colt Altairian (A.
Podmore), starting at 12 to 1, and
illustrating another Moorefield pecu-
liarity that middle-distance events
there are not infrequently won by
horses that have seemed unable to
stick out shorter trips elsewhere.
Altairian led all the Vay to down
Skilled, with Buonarroti Boy and
Hemisphere dead-heating for third.
Place-tote supporters of the dead-
heaters got less than their money
back —a very rare happening since the
old one-two-three tote system was re-
placed by the win - and - place
machines.
One particularly interesting winner
was Journalist, taking the first Two-
year-old Maiden Stakes from All
Spirit and Regard. Journalist is a
full-brother to Columnist and has at
least some share of his older relative s
looks and ability. He beat nothing
of account, and clocked dreadfully
slow time (1.19), but they can, after
all, do no more than win. He was
never headed. The second division
of the Two-year-old went to Spanish
Duke (E. Fordyce), a very easy winner
and running the six furlongs in two
seconds better time than had Jour-
nalist. Interesting to note that Spanish
Duke is by Pentheus, who still holds
the Moorefield six-furlongs record of
1.141 which he set 18 years ago.
A veteran trainer, an aged
horse and a long-unlucky
owner enjoyed a change all
round when T. T. Cook’s
elderly gelding Chatipur (R.
Morris), trained by W. S. King,
won the Rockdale Mixed
Stakes (10f.). Chatipur’s only
previous win was in a Maiden
race at Newcastle three years
ago. The finish of the Kogarah
Mixed Stakes (Bf.) was fought
out by Lone Duke (E. Doon)
and High Order, the Duke pre-.
vailing. Divisions of the Welter
(6f.) went to Persian Prince (N.
Sell wood) and Double Gift (R.
Mclntosh).
* * * *
Melbourne racing on Satur-
day returned to Caulfield, which
had been spelled for some
months. The weather, fine but
decidedly nippy, was perfect for
cross-country races, and, with
the Grand National double only
a little way off now, the jump-
ing events were the main in-
terest.
The six-year-old Waikare
gelding Faunus (R. Watts)
made an excellent impression in win-
ning the Toolambool Hurdle. Betting
on the event was open, Reynard,
Repeater and Service Boy being
equally favored at fives with Faunus
next at sixes.
Coming from South Australia with
a record of seven consecutive wins
over the sticks, Service Boy was
closely watched; he showed up
prominently at> one stage but seemed
to tire badly towards the finish and
would need a deal more gas to see
out three miles. Repeater did best
of the fancied trio, finishing third,
five lengths behind Glenriven and 10
lengths behind the winner. Fapnus
jumped splendidly and appeared to
have a fair bit in hand at the finish.
For the National he drops 31b. in the
weights to 9.12.
Favorite Benarca (W. Aldridge) was
always one of the leaders in the
Wanda Steeple and scooted away in
the straight to down old Tente by a
dozen or so lengths, with Cheery
Boy third. On the form shown it
would be difficult to concede any of
the also-rans a chance in the National,
though First Aid showed some im-
provement. Benarca carried 10.6,
drops to lOst. for the National and
cannot be penalised.
Several National candidates were
confined to a run on the flat, and
of these last year’s Hurdle-winner
Eudunda did best —a strongly-finishing
fifth in the 12-furlongs Richmond
Handicap. The Actor gelding Pan-
mure (J. Purtell) was favorite for the
Richmond, and the only anxiety he
gave was to those who don’t like to
see their fancy out in front too early
in the piece. Panmure made a go-to-
“Better swamp y'r tea down, ’ Utton —I'm goin' to skittle
y'r wicket this time."
whoa procession of it, safely, holding
Black Beau and Sir Actor at the
finish.
The six-furlongs Rosny Plate went
to another favorite in Flemish (A.
Breasley), who’ll be one to consider
should they take him north for the
Doomben Ten Thousand. He has
won at five of his last six starts, and
on Saturday carried 8.13 to down
Daverach and River Hero.
Results of two divisions of the
Minook Two-year-old Handicap were
painful in the extreme for most
punters. Still, some optimists bene-
fited ; more than 800 tote tickets were
issued for Gay Donna (J. Gilmore),
who won the second division, paying
£2l 3s. 6d. for the win and £4 ss.
for a place. Bartolus ($. Ralph),
who won the first division, started at
12 to 1 and just pipped the warm
favorite St. Rembrandt. The June
Welter saw Decorate (H. Badger)
lump topweight of 9.4 to a stylish win.
The recent convincing successes of
Decorate and other moderate ex-
Sydneyites say little for current Mel-
bourne form.

Tennis officials handling the Lon-
don championships must be just about
fed-up with visiting Australian
players. Last year members of the
Davis Cup team entered, then with-
drew after seedings and the draw
had been made. This time Bromwich
played the first few rounds, then,
with his next opponent Falkenburg, a
much tougher proposition than others
he had beaten, decided to withdraw
from the singles because of “ligament
trouble,” but said he would continue
in the doubles. It drew a pertinent
remark from an official as to the
peculiarity of players who use one
set of ligaments for singles and
another for doubles.

Norman von Nida, after wildly
hoeing into a bunker-lip with his
No. 8 iron in an effort to trim it
down and thereby himself getting
trimmed by the committee, won the
Manchester “Evening Chronicle”
tournament, bagging another £4OO to
make his winnings in England in less
than two months £1360. It makes
him the biggest winner in pro. golf
there this season. But what a temper
the little man has!
* * * *
The Australians in England:
The neW schedule, extending play-
ing time to five days (it was four
on previous tours), helped Australia
to an eight-wickets win in the first
Test at Nottingham. It was a grim
tussle throughout, unfortunately
tinged with more uproar than cheers
at times; distorted memories of the
Larwood business die hard round his
home town.
When England collapsed for 165
and Australia piled up 509, the home
cause looked a forlorn one, but
Compton’s grand second innings, in
which he put up 184 before having
the stiff luck to fall over his wicket
ducking a bumper, gave England a
faint chance of making it a draw.
Australia needed only 98, but it
was a race against rapidly-approaching
rain, which would have cooked things.
The match ended on a comic note
when Barnes smacked one, did a
rapid but inaccurate bit of mental
arithmetic, grabbed a couple of stumps
and lit out for the pavilion. The
rest, including umpires, followed him
off, and not until all were back in
the stand was it discovered that one
run was yet needed to clinch things;
so back they all trooped, and, as a
bit of poetic justice, Barnes missed
out completely in the second scramble
for “souvenirs.”
Of the six Australian bowlers used,
Bill Johnston (84 overs, 23 maidens,
183 runs, 9 wickets) and Miller (63-
18-163-7) did best. Bradman and
Hassett were top-scorers with 138
and 137 respectively in the first
innings, though in the second Don
went for a duck —his fifth from 56
Test innings and his first in a Test
in England. In 149 matches Aus-
tralia has now won 61, England 55,
the rest drawn, and they’re' off again
tomorrow; the tourists having mean-
while vanquished Northamptonshire
by an innings and 64 runs, and been
playing their return match v. the
dour men of Yorkshire.

Well over 100,000 turned up at the
six V.F.L. games in Melbourne on
Saturday, 38,000 of them at Colling-
wood to see if the locals could down
Fitzroy, leaders in the competition.
When Fitzroy shot three quick goals
it looked like a walk-over, but ’Wood
shot back five, and with Twomey
inspired at centre and Richards domi-
nating the rucks, wore ’Roy
down in a hard, battling game to
win, 15.12-13.7. In the other games
all the favorites won except Rich-
mond, which was outsped and out-
played, by the hitherto despised North
Melbourne, 14.6-9.16. Geelong, 21.13
(L. White, 11 goals) swamped St.
Kilda, 9.9; Carlton went from “go
to whoa” to pile up 23.11 to
“Sowth’s” 13.9; Melbourne beat
Hawthorn, i8.12-ll.13; and Essen-
don walloped a ’flu-stricken Foots-
cray team by 18.12 to 4.14.

In Rugby Union, Randwick beat
Gordon 14-3, forwards Shehadie,
Mudge, Brooks and Windon shining,
and half Cawsey playing an out-
standing game. Gordon was unable
to get the ball out to its try-scoring
backs, and Trevor Allan was well
bottled up when he did get it.
A University team with several sub-
stitute players did well to beat Eastern
Suburbs, 23-16. Hardcastle, consis-
tently winning balls in the lineouts, sub-
stantially helped West to beat Manly
17-11; Northern Suburbs beat East-
wood 19-11, with Brown and Burns
outstanding for the victors, and
O’Neill for the losers; and Drum-
moyne beat St. George 18-9, in a
tough game with fistic interludes
among the forwards.

Chifleyism and Enterprise
Chifleyism having taken a
heavy blow at the Prices and
Charges Referendum, to what
extent is the Government pre-
pared to reverse its socialistic
policy? And, provided it does
decide to put socialistic schemes
on the ice for the time being,
will it still inflict upon the
country the kind of government
that is characteristic of “Labor”
—that is, one involving swollen
expenditure, inflated public pay-
rolls, spoils to the political
victors, vote-catching stunts of
the most pernicious order, and
a general exercise of political
power without accepting the
national consequences?
It is unlikely that the Social-
ists in the party will give up their
ambitions easily. Nor can the
rank and file of “Labor,” less
bent on socialism, perhaps, but
well experienced in ways of
bribing the electorate politically,
be relied on to support any
policy that suggests retrench-
ment, deflation or the necessity
for civil servants or trade-union-
ists to work diligently.
Whatever Mr. Chifley or the
“Labor” Caucus attempts to do
in the way of restoring the party
to economic sanity—and it is
doubtful whether any attempt
will come from anywhere within
the party to lead it along a sober
path—there is bound to be a
“scrambling” and confusion of
objectives, the “solidarity” prin-
ciple within the ranks of
“Labor” in problems like this
making concessions and com-
promises essential. And with the
Prime Minister himself a social-
istic theorist not above trying—
and trying stubbornly—to put
his theories into practice, the
head and tail of the party might
find itself in conflict with the
middle.
On the surface, things ap-
pear to be happening in the
“Labor” ranks since the referen-
dum. Price-control is to go
within two or three months,
rationing of meat and clothing
is to go, and price-subsidies are
to be abandoned in the case of
potatoes, wool used in Aus-
tralian textiles, imported tex-
tiles, raw cotton, inter-State
shipping freights and miscellan-
eous items. Subsidies on tea,
butter and cheese and super-
phosphate will be continued, for
the time being, in co-operation
with the States, while the deli-
cate problem of coal subsidies is
to be dealt with later.
The elimination of the sub-
sidies in respect of which a
decision has already been made
will relieve the Commonwealth
Government of a liability of at
least £l2 million a year. That
sum amounts to more than the
total income tax levied by the
Commonwealth in the last year
before the war. But so far Mr.
Chifley has made no concrete
t omise of a reduction in taxes,
( . en though consumers will have
higher costs to meet and though
he has revealed that revenue for
the current term will probably
exceed estimates by £46 million,
providing the Government with
a small surplus instead of the
anticipated deficit.
On the latest figures, after
refunds have been made to the
States, the Commonwealth will
collect £lBl million of taxation
levied on incomes during the
year 1947-48, compared with- a
little over £ll million in 1938-39.
Other taxes promise to total
£177 million, making this year’s
Commonwealth rake-off from
the national income £358 mil-
lion. Total Commonwealth taxes
in 1938-39 were only £77 million
—about a fifth of the current
year’s estimated collections.
Interest on the Commonwealth
debt arising from 1939-45
war and post-war expendi-
ture has called for an in-
crease of only £3B million
in taxation, against the £2Bl
million extra taxation actually
levied. Certainly the Govern-
ment set aside £l6B million for
“defence and post-war (1939-45)
charges” for the current year,
but thaj included £3B million of
1939-45 war-debt interest, leav-
ing £l3B million for other “war”
charges. The 8.C.0.F. in Japan
costs us something each year,
but nothing like £l3B million.
That this socialistic crowd in
Canberra is still spending colos-
sal sums on “defence” three
“But if I sue for five thousand he might mess things up
and decide to marry me.”
years after the war has ended,
yet with almost nothing to
show for it, suggests that the
money is being largely employed
in the political defence of the
“Labor” party.
The Commonwealth payroll,
excluding members of the
services, is still growing. At
least 100,000 more persons are
now employed by the Common-
wealth than before the war. The
increase in total Government
employment since 1939 has been
about 170,000 persons.
The Government expects to
spend £77 million on “social
services” this year. Before the
war the cost was something like
£l6 million a year. But even
allowing for this increase in ex-
penditure (and not pausing to
question the “benefits” that it is
supposed to represent) it is plain
enough that Cariberra “Labor”
is grossly extravagant in matters
of money and manpower.
Mr. Chifley has supported his
argument for continued high
taxation with the contention that
it checked inflation. While
taxation continues to be spent
wastefully on a huge scale, keep-
ing a large body of manpower
on Government payrolls out of
productive work, and discourag-
ing tens of thousands from doing
the best they can in their jobs,
this contention is ridiculous'. If
Mr. Chifley were using taxation
to produce a large Budget sur-
plus out of which he was reduc-
ing the national debt there might
be some point to his argument.
But the Prime Minister and
Treasurer is doing no such thing.
If he shows the country a sur-
plus this year it will be through
the grdss overtaxation of the
people, not through any finan-
cial action calculated to have a
deflationary effect in the costs-
and-prices field.
Mr. Chifley has made some
terse remarks and irritated
gestures since the defeat of the
Prices and Charges Referendum,
but his concessions to the States
and to the people have been
legalistic more than financial or
industrial up to date. His reac-
tions in the matter of subsidies
will leave the Commonwealth
Treasury with more money in-
stead of less. And he has given
no indication that he is going to
try to hand over his enormous'
surplus staff of civil servants to
private industry in order to help
reduce the production deficit.
In the development of the past
few weeks there is so far little
evidence that the Socialists of
Canberra have recanted. But the
political tide is against them,
and they are being forced to
give ground here and there. In
some cases they are giving
ground at a rate which suggests
that they hope free enterprise
will be caught unprepared, with
consequent embarrassment.
Price-control was a key factor
in the socialist set-up, but so is
confiscatory taxation, still re-
tained, and so is the civil-service
army. The socialistic banking
legislation is still subject to a
decision from the High Court;
there are many other banking
controls nevertheless exercisable
by the Commonwealth Bank,
and there is Capital Issues Con-
trol.
The people, in their recent
“No” vote, drove a wedge into
the Socialists’ defences. This
may produce a weakening else-
where through its economic
reactions. There is a movement
now towards free enterprise in
Australia, but Chifleyism is
neither disposed nor equipped
to move with the tide. It will
have to be dragged- -or dumped.
Comments of national interest
by the chairman of Guinea Air-
ways, Ltd., at the annual meet-
ing:—
In December last the results of
Trans-Australia Airlines’ operations
were released. These showed that a
sum of approximately £2,170,000 had
been expended in the undertaking to
June 30, 1947, and that an operating
loss of £506,000 had been incurred.
This figure, of course, did not include
any charge for interest on capital
invested, which even at current rates
on Commonwealth loans costs the
taxpayers another £70,000 per annum.
We believe that T.-A.A. operations
since June 30 last have been no
better —that losses on the same scale,
or even higher, have continued.
We think these results make it
clear that the Government’s venture
is doomed to failure. Despite every
advantage and preference that the
Government has extended to T.-A.A.
it is apparent that it cannot secure
the support of the business com-
munity which contributes the greater
proportion of revenue. Business
people no doubt are fully alive to
the fact that if they support the
nationalised airline the Government
may be further encouraged to intrude
into other fields of industrial activity.
Our manager, Mr. Archibald, re-
cently visited New Guinea to inves-
tigate the prospects of re-establishing
our operations there. His observa-
tions make it clear that conditions
in that territory are still too confused
to offer any inducement for the
company to resume operations. There
is the added risk that if, after going
to the considerable expense of estab-
lishing an airline, the venture were
to prove a success, the Government
might take over the business for the
benefit of its own airlines —in other
words, if we fail we lose a lot of
money, whereas, if we succeed, there
is a grave danger that the Govern-
ment will reap the reward.
And §o the bogy of national-
isation by itself hinders post-
war reconstruction.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From Herbert Holman
Empire Ties
In the frustrations and agonies
of their post-war world Britons
tend to show a passive and un-
emotional reaction to the fre-
quently dismal headings of their
four-page newspapers. This
applies particularly to world
news. But the results of the
South African elections and the
personal defeat of General
Smuts caused much genuine
sorrow, not unmixed with con-
cern.
No one likes to hear of the
overthrow of an old and re-
spected friend after a lifetime of
service. General Smuts, with
Mr. Churchill, is looked upon as
one of the few statesmen whose
pronouncements extend beyond
the bounds of constituency or,
indeed, of country. For a man
of such stature to have been de-
feated over what seem to have
been purely local issues only
adds perplexity to regret.
Although it is plain that se-
cession from the Common-
wealth will not follow the return
of the Nationalists, British
people would have felt happier
had the tie between the two
countries become closer instead
of the reverse, as the election
results suggest. The recurrent
beneficence of the food parcel
has brought home to so many
British families the firm bonds
and mutual concern between in-
dividuals in all parts of the
Empire. Continual world
changes and the evergrowing
realisation of Britain’s weakened
position suggest that the present
structure of the Commonwealth
is too loose. As between man
and man the ties can never have
been stronger. The citizen
naturally seeks expression and
co-ordination on a higher level.
Lord Bruce has suggested in
the House of Lords that a stand-
ing Commonwealth Council
should be formed. Mr. Menzies
has given warning of what might
happen to the Empire if the
bonds are not tightened. Mr.
Bevin has recently spoken of
the need for harnessing Empire
and colonial resources. General
Smuts takes an even wider view-
It is known that much atten-
tion is being given to these ques-
tions in Whitehall. The British
Government is in no way in
advance of public opinion.
Cost of Living
Notwithstanding the anxiety
shown by the Government last
February to the need for keep-
ing prices down, it is an inescap-
able fact that they have con-
tinued to rise. Clothing has
been affected most.
Women’s utility clothing has
increased in price by up to 30
p.c.; bed- and table-linen by
from li p.c. to 20 p.c. Block
chocolate (of which each person
is allowed about 11b. a month)
has risen from 3d. to sd. per
2oz. bar.
Some 500,000 people, in 19
London boroughs, will have to
pay up to 27 p.c. more for their
electricity ; and 400,000 will find
that their gas costs an extra half-
penny a therm. The Metropoli-
tan Water Board has increased
its charges by from 9 p.c. to 10
p.c. of the net annual value of
the premises supplied ; and in-
dustrial consumers will have to
pay another. 2s. 3d. for every
1000 gallons of water used.
Since the Budget, a nip of
whisky costs twopence more
and beer another penny a pint;
20 cigarettes cost 3s. 6d. instead
of 3s. 4d.
Many public schools, including
Harrow, Rugby and St. Paul’s,
have raised their fees; others
are expected to follow in Sep-
tember.
Even that vital and general
necessity, the haircut, now costs
Is. 6d. —an increase of 20 p.c.
Deflation? '
If it has not been possible to
keep prices down or even to
make them standstill, one very
significant fact has emerged dur-
ing the early months of 1948,
Money is altogether tighter.
Tradespeople first began to com-
plain in January, when they
found that the quiet period
which follows Christmas did not
come to an end. They reasoned
that families had celebrated on
the 1946 scale, with its Service
gratuities and long-delayed
homecomings, and assumed that
there had been universal over-
spending.
The weeks passed and shop-
pers gave no signs of having re-
couped themselves, as had been
expected. Trade continued to be
slack.
There are many outward signs
of this. The more elegant type
of “spiv,” who at one time
spent money lavishly because he
could not conceal it, has all but
vanished from night-club and
luxury restaurant. The shop-
keeper whose courtesy is more
mercenary than natural tends
to be ingratiating. Among the
higher-priced trades of necessity
or near-necessity, such as furni-
ture and radios, there is much
grumbling, with here and there
a whisper of unemployment.
In holiday resorts it is the
cheaper type of hotel that is
full. Many families intend to
spend a week away and a week
at home. Others “can’t be
bothered to go away this year”
and have urgent jobs to be done
in home and garden. A quite
significant factor is the improve-
ment in quality of the West End
play, musical comedy and revue,
A show has to be good to pay
its way, and even a “big name”
won’t save a poor play. Theatre
audiences are not only more dis-
criminate in taste, but in general
have also to be more selective
for the sake of their pockets.
Twelfth Man
Mr. Dalton, reinstated to
Cabinet rank, may be compared
to an old stalwart who, because
of indiscreet behavior, lost
his place in the cricket team,
and who has since been
striving to regain it. At
the time of his disgrace it was
the public who were sympa-
thetic and the selectors who were
displeased. His methods of
“playing himself in” have not
commended him to the public,
who have been compelled to
wonder how he came to be picked
at any time. But if the public
have to suffer the consequences
it is the selectors who choose
the side. And an aspirant is
less likely to adopt a course that
will appeal to the spectators than
one that will influence the selec-
tors ; he may even seek to force
their hand.
What concerns the public is the
persistent rumor that the health
of another stalwart, Bevin, is
overtaxed by hard work.


ABORIGINALITIES
“South Coast”: “Jurumudi’s” account
of the North Borneo natives who con-
sume their liquidated grandparents (B.
2/6/’4B) recalls that in Queen Salote’s
little coconut kingdom the greatest in-
sult one can offer a Tongan is to tell
him to go and eat his ancestors —it is
a reminder that long ago, in Mariner’s
time, these people were guilty of eating
their enemies—a fact of which Tongans
are ashamed to this day. They maintain
that cannibalism was merely a temporary
practice into which the aristocrats of the
Pacific were inveigled by their low neigh-
bors the Fijians. “Go and eat your
grandmother” is foul language, punish-
able by fine or even imprisonment, and
when young Fijian half-castes hurl such
an imprecation across the school-ground
young Jione Tonge retaliates with “Go
and eat your boots.” That is an insult-
ing reference to the fact that when the
Fijians baked their first missionary—
with his boots on —they devoured him,
boots and all. And that usually settles
young Fisi.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: When I, as a
youth, began work on a large N.Q. station
I was soon sunburnt, saddle-weary, over-
worked and homesick, so that I reckoned
there was no romance of the bush. At
the end of three months, in the worst
heat in memory, three of us were pulling
down a roadside hotel that was on the
run —a “chain-lightning” shanty that had
long been delicensed. It was at the
junction of mile-wide stockroutes, and,
built of iron and redgum, it was a verit-
able oven. Then one sunrise a mob of
1200 bullocks from the Gulf went by
with real stockmen mounted on glisten-
ing horses, and bound a thousand miles
on the overland to Moree. Here at last
was the real Australia and adventure.
But outback, in reality, there is usually
more adventure than one is looking for.
Next morning the drover’s four-horse
wagonette returned and left a sick stock-
man in our care. The fellow told us he
had pleurisy; he hadn’t slept for a week,
and if he went to sleep he would die. The
following dawn we gave the bloke a
pannikin of tea, and as usual began dis-
mantling the iron before it got too hot
to handle. When we stopped for break-
fast the stockman was dead. We labori-
ously dug a grave, constructed a coffin
and at sunset the manager read the burial
service. There was no burial certificate,
no police present, we did not even know
the man’s name or his religion. And
what’s more, none of us ever knew it.

“Mat’s Mate”: “I’m toilin’ f’r a Wim-
mera cocky once,” said Mat. “Good boss,
too, only me an’ him an’ his missus on
the place. I hear ’em talkin’ about Will
an’ Rob an’ what they’ll do when they
come back, an’ I gather both boys is away
in Melbourne or one of them farmer
schools learain’ to be wheat champeens
or somethin’. Anyhow, the old man tells
me I needn’t worry. He tells me I’ll
like Will an’ Rob an’ he reckons they’ll
take t’ me. Now an’ again he sorter
hints me an’ one of ’em might go part-
ners in a block or somethin’, but I don’t
take any notice of that. Anyhow, a
coupler munce passes an’ one day we all
get in the car an’ head inter Dimboola
t’ meet the train bringin’ Will an’ Rob
home. An’ out o’ the train climbs a
couple of hefty females, both o’ which
gallops up t’ us an’ eyes me in a sort o’
speculatin’ way, Yairs, one’s Wilhemina
an’ the other’s Roberta an’ that night
I’m headin’ for the Hopetoun line, never
bein’ the sort o’ bloke t’ take risks with
cocky’s daughters lookin’ for a husband.”

“Blime”: I was yarning to the local
super.-spreader when Bandy Sparks
came to ask if he could get 20 tons
put out. “Sorry,” said George, “but
I’m s booked solid for months.” “But
what’s a man t’ do?” Bandy wailed.
“There ain’t a truck or spreader in the
district can do it, an’ it’s gettin’ late.”
George shook his head, and Bandy
wandered off, still asking the scenery un-
answerable questions. Coming past his
place a few days later I spotted him,
super.-bag strapped in front, spreading
with both hands. In the weeks that fol-
lowed he worked steadily over his pad-
docks, while the rabbits spread behind
him, his cows roamed through the fence
they’d broken, and his fly-struck sheep
went untended. Came the day he reached
the far corner. “Couple more hours ’ll
“Strike me —a reception committee !”
finish her,” he told me, with a sigh. “Me
hands is wore out near as bad as me
pants and boots, an’ it’ll take munce t’
catch up on me work, but she had t’
be done.” Thinking to toast the event,
I collected the wherewithal from Bung,
and on my return sought Bandy. He
wasn’t hard to locate. Picking up a
flow of dinkum colonial, I was coming in
on the beam when George hailed me.
“Poor cow’s gone mad or something,”
he mentioned, “I just called to tell him
I could spread his super, t’morrow after
all, an’ listen to him, will you?”

“The Pirate”: Odd sea-elephants, other
than the arrivals from Macquarie Island
last March, have visited the Common-
wealth in recent years (B. 28/4/’4B).
Last winter a massive female, Bft. in
length, had a snore-off on the beach at
Eaglehawk Neck (Tas.) and was photo-
graphed by Roy Vider of the Tassie Film
Laboratory. Although the amphibian
bore evidence of attacks by killer whales
she didn’t appear to be sick; her visit
was probably for a rest from a long
wander before returning to southern
latitudes for the breeding season. Over
the years other arrivals have been re-
ported in The Speck. One, a huge bull
“whose roars would break the blasts of
an Antarctic gale,” was recorded on
Bruni Island by the late Clive Lord,
former director of the Tasmanian
museum.

“Eastern”: Dad, in the district centre
for a day’s shopping, paused to watch
as the man on the street reserve opened
his big black book at a tassel-marked
chapter and voiced a loud challenge to
the world. As the shopping crowd
hurried on, unheeding. Dad drew slowly
nearer, gained a garden seat and, with
elbow on knee and chin cupped in his
fist, leaned forward eagerly. Flattered
by such reward after months of fruitless
endeavor, the evangelist gave of his best.
He flung his arms wildly, his chest
heaved, and his weff-built frame quivered
and swayed as he boomed forth untir-
ingly. Came a pause in his oratory, and
Dad popped in with an urgent request
to speak to him. The beaming coun-
tenance nearly set fire to the seat. He
dropped alongside Dad, and laid a com-
forting hand on his shoulder. I under-
stand, brother,” he encouraged. ‘ You
are indeed sorely pressed. Your life is
burdened and bowed down with trials
and tribulation, till you know not which
way to turn.” Dad agreed with fervor.
“And you need help?” the other con-
tinued. “You seek a strong arm and a
stout heart in your time of trouble?”
“Too flamin’ right,” said the old bloke.
“You look a strong cove. I wus
wonderin’ if y’d pull on a fencin job
at thirty-bob a chain,”

“Jemac”: “Naturala’s” theory of teredos
boring from inboard to outboard of ships
boats (B. 9/6/’4B) seems feasible, but he
is wrong in assuming that a worm loose
in the water could not obtain sufficient
purchase to start boring. The pest is
fitted with a round sucker-like foot with
which it adheres to its meal. Even S.
American greenheart offers only tem-
porary resistance to the tiny filing jaws ;
the sucker would afford the same initial
purchase on copper.

“Old-timer”: Big Fleming dropped his
swag and surveyed Gunningbland, whose
two most outstanding features were Bob
Gamble’s store and the railway siding,
the rest being wire fences, stubble pad-
docks and three roads. Fleming en-
countered a stray agriculturist outside the
store and asked, “Where does that road
go?” “Forbes.” “Huh, bin there. What
about that one?” “That’s the Parkes
road.” “Bin there, too. What about that
one?” “Goes t’ Bogan Gate.” “Strike
me roan, I was there last night.” Flem-
ing looked so utterly disgusted that the
local said, “Why, don’t y’ like goin’ t’
places where y’ve bin before?” “Aw, it
ain’t that,” snorted Fleming. “It’s this
blasted trampin’ about, never gettin’ any
place. Man wears himself out f’r nothin’.”
“Well, why don’t y’ take a job an’ get
off the track?” Fleming was astonished.
“What!” he cried. “An’ go mad with the
monotony of always bein’ in the same
place. Not on y’r ruddy life!” And he
picked up the knot and made south.

“Kelms”: With the driest May in 20
years to support me, I feel confident in
predicting a dry winter for W.A. The
white-gums which usually blossom so
profusely were scarcely noticeable, and
the black cockatoos appear to have post-
poned their migration indefinitely. The
ants have disdained to add their water-
shedding equipment to their domiciles,
and they haven’t shown any partiality to-
wards higher ground. These may be
misleading. But there is one infallible
sign. An unseasonable summer is always
followed by an unusual winter. The Big
State experienced its mildest and driest
summer for decades in the season just
past, and this winter I wouldn’t have a
Westralian wheat cocky’s worries for all
the power of Calwell.*

“Bosun’s Mate”: Krakatoa originated
the loudest noise recorded on earth (B.
26/5/’4B), but Rabaul’s eruption 11 years
ago this month offered as impressive a
sight as I’ve seen in some years’ wander-
ing. On June 2, after preliminary blasts
from old Matupi’s ulcered mouth on the
mainland, what had previously been a
small, prettily-clad island in the harbor
rocked and roared and heaved itself into
a huge hump of lava-streaked mud 200 ft.
high. A 50yd. channel blocked with
sunken reefs which had separated it from
the mainland was now solid mud.
The dead, untouched mud which had
lain for dateless ages under deep water
shone lividly in the hot sunlight, and
stank to high heaven. We entered harbor
a day or so after the eruptions, Matupi’s
blast had scorched the harbor littoral to
grey ash; it looked like a shaven skull,
with bumps and hollows revealed. But
the strangest sight was the harbor itself.
It was completely covered with a thick
layer of brown pumice-stone. The ship
ploughed through and the smothering
stuff closed up behind. With the ebb,
the harbor magically cleared, to present
again in the morning, with the inflow of
pumice again on the flood tide, the im-
pression of a 10,000-ton cruiser anchored
on sand —a veritable ship of the desert.

“B. A. Ker”: Although the fisherman
in me rebels at the thought of preserving
for posterity a snake so small that it
will fit in a bottle (unless it is a specimen
of the beautiful black-and-white Moon-
light-snake or similar ornamental
wriggler), I wouldn’t cbntest the conten-
tion that the correct technique is to lower
the living reptile into its glass tomb tail-
first (B, 5/5/’4B). But when trying the
same method with a sugar-bag as the
receptacle it might be judicious to have
the Condy’s handy. A mate of mine
had that peculiar kink that makes men
capture and handle snakes for no appa-
rent reason except, perhaps, skite. His
method of capture was the unoriginal
forked-stick behind the head, followed by
an unorthodox hand-grip—on the tail.
Held by the tail, at arm’s length, a snake
could not swing in far enough to strike,
he declared, while to spiral upwards
would take the reptile at least 40 seconds,
and a twist of the fingers would defeat
the attempt, anyway. Disaster came when
he changed his technique and dropped
a big-girthed black into a sugar-bag tail-
first. Yes, yes, I’ve seen it done plenty
of times, too. But this time the bottom
of the bag was resting on the ground.
Joe just braced his tail and waited for
the grip to be released. A badly-scarred
thumb still carries grim evidence of the
mess a scarifying job can be when carried
out with a sharp penknife held in the
right hand by a left-handed amateur
snake-charmer.,

“Bilbia”: While trying to extract an
empty shell from my .32 W.C.F. rifle I
inadvertently jammed in the barrel first a
piece of fencing-wire, then a piece of
pine and finally a piece of iron about
4in. long and about the same size as
the bore of the rifle. Hammering only
made the whole thing tighter, so I filled
the barrel with oil and put the rifle away
for a fortnight. Then I heated the barrel;
there was a loud explosion and the iron
flew from the muzzle with sufficient force
to penetrate a lin. floorboard. The rifle
is shooting as well as ever.
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: Vines and climbing
plants twine themselves around their sup-
ports in a right-to-left spiral (B. 12/5/’4B)
because their dominating inclination is
towards the east and thence towards the
sun’s arc across the sky. In the southern
hemisphere this path is to the north
hence the right-to-left spiral. This was
first explained to me by a fresh-faced
young associate of my rookie days. He
claimed, further, to be able to determine
the direction of the east by the vines.
I’ve tried, dozens of times, but I can
never determine the point of its spiral
at which it heads in the right direction.
But my mentor had something there all
right—the Army gave him a commission
on the strength of it. .

“Gravelsnatcher”: “Bughouse” handles
terms carelessly when he states (B.
5/5/’4B) “light can penetrate anywhere
and “light and electricity are themselves
the same thing.” Light is “that form ot
motion or energy capable of affecting the
organs of sight and thus rendering "visible
the objects from which it proceeds ;
consequently light, in the strict sense ot
the term, cannot penetrate a brick wall.
Nor is light the same as electricity, de-
spite “B.’s” having seen that commodity
turn to light when he pressed a switch.
“B.” mentions “light travelling at suffi-
cient speed.” But the speed of light is
determined within certain definite limits
beginning at 186,400 miles per second.
Beyond the upper limits of- that range
are other rays of greater penetrating
power. Coming down the scale we have
a variety of rays leading to those within
the audio-frequency range. We call those
rays sound, so presumably sound is
“light slowed down.” It may be, ot
course. In the light of modern physics
anything can be almost anything ese
more or less modified. Einstein once
claimed to be able to reduce the universe
to nothing—mathematically —and recently
some remarkable facts have been re-
vealed. It has long been known that
light possesses weight. During a s °
eclipse a beam of light from a distant
star was observed to bend inwards as it
passed the sun, and only objects pos-
sessing weight respond to a grayitatio
pull. But now scientists believe tha
speed—the ultimate in intangibility—also
has weight. Not momentum, mind you.
weight. A fast-moving object gams
actual weight as it gams speedL
sound, light, speed and matter ma

“B.” is right after all.
CONTELLY.
Cold is the nest on the cliffs of Contelly;
Empty the aerie, the eagles have flown;
Only the morning airs, naked and chilly,
Only the night winds now make it their own.
No more the windows wtih crimsons and ambers
Mirror the sundown or signal the day,
No more the garden-rose tangles and clambers
Over the fences all fallen away.
Turn where you will through the sparse groves
of wattle
Looking for life there, what will you find?
Only the curious stares of scrub cattle;
Only the bird-music blown on the wind.
Stock in dry seasons have trampled and taken
Toll of the fruit-trees, down-eaten to earth;
Even the possums now leave it forsaken,
Even the bush creatures give it wide berth.
Thick weed upthrusting through broken board
floorings,
Worm-eaten rafters dust-dry at the core —
Now the bush spider swings at her moorings,
Squats in her circle where once was a door.
Sport of the westerlies, wide lintels splinter.
Over the hearthstone the cloud-shadows fly;
All the doors open to summer or winter.
All the walls empty to weather and jsky,
'No dogs now welcome return or arrival,
No horses graze by the house-paddock gate;
One lofty pine-tree, in lonely survival,
Sighs to the seven winds, early and late,
While a black-and-white wagtail its musical
numbers,
.. Its “Sweet pretty creature” repeats from its
spars—
Even as I heard it through childhood’s light
slumbers,
Long ago nesting-nights, close to the stars.
Would I return, could time be unravelled
Back to the very beginnings of me?
Not if it left the same roads to be travelled,
Waterless desert or treacherous sea.
Whether the future be stormy or stilly
I think I’ll be finding, however I roam,
Only in Heaven another Contelly,
Love and security, freedom and home.
.VICTORIA.

“Lower Tops’!”; Seawater as a cause
of volcanoes erupting (B. 26/5/’4B)
reminds me. Steaming along one dark
night past Wewak (N.G.) —then Jap-held
—our small naval vessel was running on
an easterly course to pass close to the
mouth of the Sepik. Suddenly the boong
on the lookout reported sandbanks to
starboard. My heart missed a beat, for
there were sandbanks all around us.
However, a bearing on the glow of Bam
Island crater, 40-odd miles ahead, re-
vealed we were dead on course. In-
vestigation proved the phenomenon to
be islands of pumice—some as large as
a house —spread over an area of miles.
It is spewed up from the seabed by a
submarine volcano. But that kind of
phenomenon always occurs to scare a
crew when —contrary to orders —they are
taking a short-cut!
♦ ♦ ♦ *
“Solitude”: We were mustering a
stretch of back-country with hills so
steep even the crows wore cruppers, and
the nags were tiring. Hour after hour
we battled through heavy timber, skirted
washouts or picked a foothold round
hillsides that would have brought a blush
to the man from Snowy River. Setting
a course by the sun to save miles of
back-tracking, we came on a steep side
that showed little hope of negotiation.
Along the top we rode, searching for a
grade, when Seventyfiver’s nag suddenly
lost his footing. Down he slithered, on
his haunches or on his side, forelegs
pawing wildly for a hold, and Seventy-
fiver juggling himself wildly on top.
Horrified, I glimpsed the rock-face below.
They reached it, struggled on the brink,
and went over. For several seconds
nothing showed, then the nag rolled into
view, and a few feet away the old bloke
reappeared, dodged a jagged boulder by
inches, and catherine-wheeled to the gully.
Beside me, old Blue whined unhappily
as we waited. Then the old bloke got up,
rammed on his lid, and limped to inves-
tigate his nag for damages. That over,
he ran a hand experimentally over him-
“Get back and wait for the signal!”
self and began to cuss. His voice floated
indistinguishably to where Blue and I
crouched till he stepped back and lobked
up. “Hey, Sol I” he yelled. “Keep a look
out fT the flamin’ button orf me pants on
y’r way down, will y’?”
• * * *
“Nori-west”: “Conda’s” description of
how a flying-fish doesn’t fly (B. 12/5/’4B)
nicely fits the escape methods of the
tropical garfish. Surface-swimmers and
-feeders, these are constantly harassed
by cannibal fish that shoot up from the
deeps. To escape them the gar leaves
the water with a rush, but rises only a
few inches. Continually it falls during
this rapid flight, only to recover flight
the instant it touches water again. For
a hundred yards and more the gar will
thus skim along, not infrequently so
blinded by panic that it will bash into
the side of a lugger or of a cliff hedging
deep water. But the flying-fish, the
flying gurnet of the Indian Ocean, flies
well enough to deserve its name. Have
seen them sailing along 10 or 12 feet
above the waves, covering the best part
of 100 yards; and often, with a mere
dip of the tail at the end of that flight,
off again for a shorter run. Pursued by
the swift bonito the gurnet leaves the
water at high speed, which gives it its
initial impulse. And though their fin-
wings may not flap, they certainly show a
tremulous motion that possibly assists
them materially in maintaining their
quite-lengthy flight.
“Hanko”: “Eastern” (B. 9/ 6 / ’4B) re-
minds me that there’s been a thrush in
my yard for almost three years. He has
a special twig in a peach-tree from which
to sing, and a special stone on which to
smash shellbacks. On an occasion I
placed a handful of grass on the stone,
and when Harmonica arrived with a snail
he was somewhat shocked. Mulling it
over with much head-cockings, he at
length dropped the snail and pushed the
grass from the stone, the while keeping
a watchful eye on the gastropod as if
it might develop a secret momentum and
dash off like a Bondi tram.

“Canine”; Sometimes a bitch looks as
if she is about to become a mother but
ultimately does not. On very rare
occasions she will even seek out a quiet
possie in which to have the pups just
about the time she should be whelping.
Although they don’t turn up, she will be
just as weak as if they had, and while
in this condition will put on a weird
saddening performance by hunting about
for bits of rag, socks and the like and
taking them to her bunk to care for and
play with as if they were her pups.
* * * *
“Flathead”: Sharing a friend’s jetty,
his tobacco and his bait, and uninter-
rupted by annoying nibbles, I was falling
off into comfortable lethargy, at peace
with the world, when he shattered it all
by announcing there was a shark about
and asked me to take a good sniff. I
did so and detected a trace of something
like cod-liver oil. I was telling him that
it probably came from the tannery across
the inlet when the fin cut surface 20
yards out. My friend puts it down to a
form of shark-halitosis, but I await the
verdict of the Council.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”; It all started when Ted
wanted a recipe to rid his kitchen of
cockroaches, George thought you could
buy a mixture of arsenic; Bert wasn’t
sure about that, but he’d heard that Paris-
green was pretty good, Chicka knew a
certain exterminator: borax and sugar
Instantly his consistent contradictor,
Nugget, was profanely sure that nothing
would get rid of the pests if they didn’t
want to go. Within three sentences
tempers were frayed. Chicka knew crim-
son well because he’d got rid of the
sanguine things with gore-spattered borax.
Nugget was warming to his reply when
a dungareed Solomon reminded: “There
are different sorts of cockroaches you
know,” Chicka accepted the opening,
“I’m talking about bush cockroaches,”
he said. “Oh, them,” Nugget retracted;
“it might kill them, but when I was a
kid in Erskineville we used to see ’roaches
three inches long. I guarantee you
couldn’t poison them with prussic acid.”
“Three inches long!” (Chicka wouldn’t
concede that the city could beat the
bush in anything.) “Neither you nor any-
one else ever saw a ’roach that length.”
Again the wrangle was on—and fast
reaching the combat stage when Nutty
put in with his mild drawl: “Well, I
dunno. I saw some sizeable ones on a
ship once; in fact, I broke my nose
through a couple of ’em. I woke up
early one morning, slipped out of my
berth and was just sticking my feet in
my slippers when—bang!—down I went
flat on my face against a locker.” Chicka
looked at the travelled one suspiciously.
“Can you read, Joe? What kind a cakes DID that bloke at the store
sell me?”
“Don’t tell me the' cockroaches were so
thick you slipped on ’em,” he saicj. “No,
it wasn’t that,” Nutty explained. “But
I’d made a mistake—they weren’t my
slippers at all; I was standing on the
backs of two cockroaches.”
* * * ♦
“Bamekaw”: Authority has shifted
the native population from Saibai Island,
Torres Strait —reason, sea-erosion. I’m
not surprised. Although Saibai on the
map appears quite a respectable size (it
looks like a bloated tick dropping off the
underbelly of Papua), and covers about
30 square miles, it is mostly dreary man-
grove swamp, and horribly flat, nowhere
more than a few feet above sea-level.
The natives were crowded on one end
with barely enough tillable land to grow
a few acres of tubers. The last time I
was there the sea was bringing down
mighty palms which had been planted
some distance from the sea-front, and the
huts behind them were wet every time
a heavy blow whipped-up the waves.
Saibai is famous in the Strait for its mos-
quitoes and mud-crabs. Old hands de-
bate whether the mossies grew so fierce
trying to pierce the crustaceans’ armor
or the crabs so large to try to beat the
insects. The natives were fine specimens,
superior in physique to the mainlanders.
Unfortunately t.b., malaria and inbreed-
ing have done much to weaken the race,
aided by an indulgent Government which
allowed the coons to strap-up huge
tucker bills at the State-controlled store,
with the result that they preferred to get
on credit devitalised flour, tinned fish
and treacle rather than engage in healthy
exercise by cultivating or catching their
natural foods,
* * * *
“Zake”: Old Dan had bought for a
song from the insurance company an
old car that had caught alight and burnt
completely the bodywork. Three of the
wooden wheels were still in fair condi-
tion, but one was badly charred. Dan
announced that he’d use a spare sulky-
wheel he had. “But with one little wheel
and one big ’un all you’ll do is go round
in circles,” said someone on the pub
verandah. “You’ll only lob back to
where you started from.” “Well, Ido
When I go to town now on me bike,”
replied Dan, “What’ll be the diff’rence?”
* * * *
“Wish-bone”: If Cape Barren goose
isn’t a game-bird what is it? I’ve spent
a whole day doing a stomach-crawl
around the windswept, treeless, two-miles-
long Preservation Island in Bass Strait
trying to sneak on a mob of 50-odd graz-
ing on the pastures there. And then I
couldn’t get a shot. Like white cocka-
toos, the big grey geese post sentries ;
they are extremely wary, and, usually
feeding in the open, they take killing—
even with a shot-gun in range—though,
like swan, they are best stopped by put-
ting a charge into their necks. But one
doesn’t have to kill a wild bird to taste
this flier. Around Flinders Island it is
not uncommon for them to join forces
with domestic geese while grazing, and
in captivity they thrive and breed well.
* * * *
“Plip”; With the score even, Bom-
bina’s and Bogulla’s heftiest crunched
together in possibly the last scrum of the
match. Then over their grunting came a
high-pitched yelp, proving, when the ref.
waved them back to investigate, to have
been emitted by a Bogulla man as a
token that he had been separated from
portion of his right ear. Unlike the
similar celebrated occurrence in Sydney
which even dethroned the horses from
the sports-pages at the time, the local lug
case was settled there and then on Bom-
bina oval. After the “zambuk” had done
his job, the ref., Bombina-reared, called
the victim and the guilty party aside, and
with his usual impartiality announced
“The way I look at it, Bert, he definitely
bit y’, but then y’ never would have lost
it if y’ hadn’t pulled away!”
* * * *
“Colonial Cove”; Many an honest
shanty-keeper of the old days never ran
short of beer, though the nearest brewery
might be 200 miles away. With hops,
sugar, a few mashed potatoes and a little
flour he could make yeast. With yeast,
hops, sugar and grain he could brew beer.
The grain—barley or wheat —could be
used straight, or, if he were a pains-
taking man, he could make it into malt.
Merely by soaking until it sprouted, then
a drying-off and a final roast over a slow
fire. Wheat malt wasn’t as potent as
barley, but it did. Hops, about a pound
to 10 gallons of water, boiled for half an
hour; then a few handfuls of the grain
thrown in. Cooled slowly to lukewarm,
then yeast and sugar were added. Left
standing a couple of days the brew was
then strained, and was ready for the
barrel. Burnt sugar—caramel—gave the
desired amber color. If fighting beer was
required a length of black twist tobacco
was dropped in through the bunghole.
Within a week the stuff would be so
heady that it would be struggling to get
out. But all that was of the long ago;
don’t try it now, for such a brew often
ran to 6 p.c. alcohol —a wish-wash of
one or two per cent, is all modern law
allows to the home-brewer.
* * * *
“Bo”: Curran and his son, coming
back from the township, rounded a bend
and came on a strange sight. A horse was
standing by the side of the road cropping
the grass, and, suspended upside-down
between its front legs, with his feet still
in the stirrups, was its rider. The Currans
instantly recognised the horse as
Manton’s Sandy, a very placid 15-year-
old, and the rider as Manton’s nephew,
who was holidaying with them. They
pulled up and got out, walked slowly
around the horse and examined the
saddle. Young Curran opined that Sandy
must have jerked his head down suddenly,
caught the rider off balance and that the
volition brought him over his mount’s
head. Old Curran maintained that it
couldn’t possibly have happened unless
the horse had stumbled or propped sud-
denly while going at a good pace. They
argued the merits and demerits of each
other’s case, closely examined the attitude
of the still-suspended rider, whose urgent
pleas to be released they didn’t appear
to hear. Finally old Curran angrily
stumped off. “I tell y’ it couldn’t have
been from just a head-jerk,” he snapped.
“Look at his position. Just keep Sandy
from moving while I go and get Fred
Carslaw —I’ll bet y’ a quid he backs my
argument! ”
♦ * * *
“L.P.”: In an area I had ferreted and
filled in I noticed that stray rabbits put
up by my not-very-speedy dog would try
as many as six blocked-in burrows before
giving up in despair and confusion. As
soon as they found one burrow blocked
they would make a bee-line for the next.
I have noticed, too, that although a
rabbit has an excellent memory for the
location of burrows, it does not keep
itself very well informed as to their con-
dition. When pressed by a dog it is not
uncommon to see bunny head straight for
a burrow that had been dug out or
blocked two to three weeks before.
EMPTY SADDLES.
Oh, faster now and faster he speeds toward his
home,
The signal of disaster all smeared with clinging
foam;
Over the long brown paddocks, down from the
mountain-sides
The horse upon whose back an empty saddle
rides.
He thunders down the valley, he sweeps across
the rise—
Well know the brave bush horses where help
and safety lies!
He dashes through the gateway and snorts and
circles wide.
A horseman croons to soothe him; he stands
with heaving side.
What fall or what disaster do the bush-clad
mountains hide?
Fast come the grey man’s orders —“Now saddle,
boys, and ride.”
Heavy this man with knowledge, veteran of
countless spills;
But no man knows the answer that lies among
the hills.
Here where the horseman’is glory on hoof-torn
script is scrolled
There is one law that rules us, just as it ruled
of old:
In fine or stormy weather, on smooth or rugged
track,
Who sees an empty saddle must run the hoof-
marks back.
Fear of the horseman’s sweetheart, fear of the
horseman’s wife,
Always the lurking shadow that clouds the
horseman’s life:
Too brave a heart may bring it, too bold the
hand at rein, *
But the doom notes that ring it are hoofbeats
on the plain.

SYDNEY RAM SALES.
“Bungaree”: Since Merinos
first arrived in Australia there
has never been a better market
for sheep than now. Though
higher prices have been realised
for individual rams, averages
at the Sydney sales will take a
lot of beating. Seasonal condi-
tions, wool prices, store and fat-
stock values are all good, and
taxation forces woolmen to
almost reckless reinvestment of
profits at sales. In the three
selling days, close on 1300
Merino rams were sold for
nearly £106,000; average price
of studs was £152 and of
selected and flock rams £31 —-
an overall average of slightly
under £B3 a head. There were
rams to suit all tastes —from the
superfine Yass types to the big,
extra-strong-woolled South Aus-
tralians —a range of spinning
counts from 80’s down to 54’s;
bulk of the rams were strong
to strong-medium wools.
Top price was 1700gns. for a
Haddon Rig ram. Best prices
on the first day: Merryville,
500, 370 and 320 guineas; Ege-
labra, 900 and 450; Uardry,
500, 350 and 310; Wanganella
Estate, 700; Mumblebone, 360
and 300; Bundemar, 1075, 725
and 500; Mungadal, 325 ; and
Haddon Rig’s notable team
1700, 1600, 1300 (twice), 1000,
900, 750, 500, 425, 350 and 300
guineas. This particular lot
averaged 511 guineas a head.
Second day: Wahwoon, 850, 800,
700, 500, 400, 325 and 300
guineas; Burrabogie, 700;
Stradbrooke (S.A.), 300; Boo-
noke, 1450, 1300 and 700; Uar-
dry, 300; Haddon Rig, 500
(twice) and 450 guineas. Con-
cluding day: Uardry ram at
1200 guineas, the lot averaging
600. Austin Wanganella sold a
1200-guineas ram; Haddon Rig
notched 1075, 1050, 500, 310 and
300; Bundemar, two at 500;
big, extra-strong wools from
Kanoona (S.A.), 750, 450, 400
and 350; Bungaree (S.A.), 300
guineas.
It was harder than usual to
assess the possible price of a
ram. Some had to go far beyond
their limits for the ram they
wanted, others had rams knocked
down to them at anything from
a third to a fifth of the antici-
pated price. Flock rams from
prominent studs frequently made
more than studs from lesser-
known breeders.
Bulk of the special studs were
plain-bodied, but they had den-
sity and length of staple to a
remarkable degree. There were
rams showing development for
those who wanted it, but they
were comparatively plain com-
pared with the studs of a decade
ago. Although the general
standard was high, there were
faulty—even ugly—rams. Bad
backs were too numerous, and a
fault which is not tolerated in
the show-ring —black spots on
noses and dark hooves —was
evident even in some of the
high-priced rams; apparently
some breeders take a more
lenient view than do judges.
Considerable interest was
shown in the polled rams offered
by Boonoke, and they sold to
300 guineas, 14 studs and flocks
averaging 65 guineas. It is too
early to expect from the polls
the quality of the horned rams,
but the polls included several
nice sheep. They had plenty of
size ; their chief weakness lay in
their unevenness. There were
both strong and medium types,
but some wools were starey,
others lacked character and lack
of density. Still they have
advantages, and their future will
be watched with interest.
Corriedales.
“J.R.D.”: There was a good
demand for good stud rams, and
buyers were prepared to pay
for quality. However, top studs
were few and the general im-
pression was that, with a few ex-
ceptions, breeders had sold their
best sheep prior to the show.
Wellwood topped the sales once
again with a ram of great scale
and a splendid sire’s fleece. His
long shafty wool was on the
strong side of 50’s and full of
character. He changed hands at
310 guineas; another big ram
from the same stud brought 150
guineas.
Guthrie Corriedales sold well,
making 240 guineas for the pick
of the consignment. Other good
sales included a Cullingral ram
at 150 guineas, three Redbanks
at 230, 180 and 110 guineas, a
Sargood at 150 guineas and a
Sloane at 130 guineas. There
was a wide variety, and fleece
quality ranged from 46’s to 56’s,
with a number of mushy,
starey fleeces and the usual wide
range in size. Flock rams sold
down to 7 guineas, and many
failed to raise a bid. Clearances
were generally satisfactory, how-
ever, in spite of the high re-
serves in certain studs.
British Breeds.
For this an indoor ring was
made, tiers of woolbales formed
an amphitheatre, races and
check-pens led to and from the
ring and the sale sheep came to
the buyers instead of the buyers
following the auctioneers round
the pens. This system has de-
cided advantages.
Southdowns were not in de-
mand and clearances were poor.
Only about 30 p.c. of offerings
changed hands, and highest price
was 70 guineas for a Letts ram.
Next best was 20 guineas. Appa-
rently the export-lamb market is
not yet attractive enough to
tempt breeders. On the other
hand Dorsets met an eager de-
mand. Very few rams were
passed in. Top price was 125
guineas for a Lindsbury ram
barely a year old. A nice low-
set Marylebone ram a month
older changed hands at 100
guineas; prices exceeding 50
guineas were common. Rom-
ney Marsh offerings were limited
to two lots, and buyers on the
lookout for good quality were
“If this don't git 'im up. I'll sack 'im!"
disappointed. A Tenandra Park
21-months-old ram brought
41 guineas. The other lot con-
sisted of studs and flocks mixed
and offered as one lot. They
brought guineas.
Border Leicesters formed the
bulk of the catalogue, and any-
thing showing quality sold well.
Sales reaching three figures in-
cluded Kelso Park at 180 and 105
guineas, stud ewes 165 and 100
guineas, a Barfold stud ram at
115 guineas and a Kelval at 100
guineas. Many others changed
hands at figures between 50 and
100 guineas. Although South-
down and Romney prices were
low, those paid for Borders and
Dorsets were sufficiently high to
make the average price of all
British breeds a record for Syd-
ney.
Iron for Pigs.
“Mr.”: New-born pigs kept
under sty conditions without
access to soil haven’t the oppor-
tunity to obtain the iron and
copper they need, and they’ll fail
to thrive if nothing is done to
make good the deficiency
Rparing under the paddock sys-
tem is the ideal, but if this isn’t
possible throw a shovelful or
two of soil into the pen daily.
As an alternative, A. R. Gray-
son, B.V.Sc., of Vic. Department
of Agriculture, recommends
dosing piglets five or six days
after birth with reduced iron,
obtainable from any chemist in
the form of a coarse powder.
The dose will cover the surface
of a threepenny piece. Place
this on the back of the pig’s
tongue. One dose is sufficient.
A Cane Pest.
“Thap”: The cane-killing
weed is small —only about 15in.
to 18in. in height and very
slender —but it is just what
its name implies. Its tiny
seeds germinate with the cane,
and the questing roots grow
into those of the cane, forming
swellings at the points of attach-
ment. A poison is passed from
the parasite to the cane, which
struggles along for a while and
then dies. The weed is most
common in new land, or in land
being recultivated after a spell of
some years, and has been found
in cane areas all the way from
Childers to the Burdekin. The
new, hormone-type weed-killers
may settle the pest, as they do
Star of Bethlehem and many
other smothering twiners.
Road-trains.
“W.S.P.”: “C. Punch” (B.
12/5/’4B) is far astray when he
talks about developing the fat-
tening possibilities of the
Channel country by using diesel
road-trains. His figures as to
carrying capacity of the road-
trailers “each carrying 100 head”
are fantastic. Nearly all N.S.W.
railway cattle-vans have a capa-
city of 10 head, while most
Queensland vans (eight-wheelers)
carry 18. That number of ani-
mals fully occupy a space 32ft,
by Bft. If “C. Punch’s” trailer
was Bft. wide it would require
to be 188 ft. long! Some wheel-
base! And the diesel hauls five
of these ! As a vehicle carrying
station-bred cattle requires a
substantial superstructure each
trailer loaded would weigh from
60 to 80 tons. Picture such
vehicles travelling the almost
roadless western country during
a wet spell. Hadn’t “C.P.” better
forget the idea of such a means
of moving some 400,000 cattle
from 1000 to 1500 miles to the
Channel area in a couple of
months and moving them to rail-
head after fattening?
Polishing-wheels.
“J.J.A.”; Hours of filing,
rasping, sandpapering can be
saved with polishing-wheels
made by gluing emery or sand-
paper on to steel or wooden
disks and attaching them to the
driving mechanism of an ordi-
nary bench emery-wheel. These
disks are for polishing and grind-
ing flat surfaces, and can be
changed quickly. Glue emery-
cloth on the disk for iron, steel
and other metals, and sandpaper
or glasspaper for wood. These
emery disks are ideal for sharp-
ening knives, shears, plane-
blades, chisels, etc.
Similar wheels suitable for
polishing or grinding round work
can be made by gluing strips of
emery-cloth or sandpaper to the
circumference of a wooden or
metal wheel. They have ad-
vantages over the emery-wheel,
as they are cheaper, and a wide
range of different cutting grades,
shapes and sizes can quickly
and easily be made at home.
Fowl Mortality.
“Jock”: The outstanding
problem facing the egg industry
is fowl mortality. At present
the accepted annual mortality-
rate is between 12 and 15 per
cent. —a figure which would
drive any other livestock venture
out of business. The only reason
that the poultryman survives is
that the hen is cheaply replaced.
Some flocks which are heavily
culled show better figures —the
hen which looks a bad risk is
culled while she still has a
market value, but the eco-
nomic loss is not removed, it is
lessened. Judging a flock on egg-
production is misleading, and
the total picture is only seen
when production and mortality
are both considered. Another
good indication of efficiency is
to show a chick-mortality figure
of 10 per cent, or lower —taken
over the period of hatching to
maturity. Any increase in this
figure means a de-
crease in standards
of sanitation.
The high mor-
tality is due to
several increasing
factors. These in-
clude the removal
of the fowl from
its natural environ-
ment and way of
life, the use of in-
tensive methods of
rearing and pro-
duction, a selection,
breeding, manage-
ment and feeding
programme aimed
at constant egg-production in-
stead of confining production to
the natural times of spring and
summer.
Sowing Lucerne.
“Mr.”: In Victoria it can be
autumn- or spring-sown. If
autumn is selected, remember
that lucerne is normally a
summer grower and is greatly
handicapped if sown too late.
Winter-growing weeds compete
with it and winter pests —pea-
mite and lucerhe flea principally
—don’t give it a chance.
L. C. Bartels, B.Agr.Sc., in
Vic. “Journal of Agriculture,”
recommends extended prepara-
tion of the seedbed and warns
against sowing on virgin land.
Lucerne should be preceded by
one or more preliminary crops.
A firm seedbed is best obtained
from a bare fallow, held until
favorable weather makes sowing
a better gamble. Fallowing
almost ensures a successful stand

in Victoria, even in poor sea-
sons.
Mix seed and super, and sow
through the manure-box of the
drill. If the tubes are withdrawn
from the hoes and allowed to
dangle the seed will be scattered
in the rill made by the hoe, and
a light harrow trailing behind
will cover it.
Onion-growing.
“Hortus”: Now’s the time for
planting them out. A sensible
idea is to plant the young seed-
lings on the shortest day and take
the matured onions out on the
longest day. Another good
method is to fix on the hottest
part of the year in your district
and work back seven months.
Most soils will grow onions.
Don’t make the ground too
rich. A good even mixture of
sandy and black or sandy and
red volcanic is ideal. The point
is that the onions that keep the
best are those grown on soils
that are not too light. Be careful
about drainage. Choose a well-
drained patch. Have a fairly
deep furrow between every two
rows of plants to carry off any
surplus water.
When planting, make a drill a
few inches deep and put in it a
fair sprinkling of P.B. 3 or 5.
Then with a rake pull the soil
into the drill from both sides,
forming a slightly-raised, narrow,
rectangular bed. Press this
down hard. Onions won’t do
any good unless they have a firm
bed to start. In this hardened
surface make a small hole with
a finger and pmss the plant into
it, just covering the root section.
Before planting cut off the top
green shoot, leaving about 2in.
above the bulb. Then trim the
roots evenly to about lin. or
Hin. below the bulb. By trim-
ming off shoots and roots it
stands to reason that more
nourishment is concentrated in
the bulb, which is, of course,
what is desired.
Keep the onions well weeded.
Keep soil between the rows well
worked, but don’t interfere with
the hardness of the onion-bed it-
self. Onions like to feel the
earth compact round them at
all times of their growth. If
this is done, much larger onions
will result. Onions that will
keep for several months are
Brown Spanish or Early Hunter
River Brown. The white and
odorless varieties are nice-tast-
ing, but they don’t keep like the
brown.
Hints for the Farm.
“Wilco”; Virgin land intended
for cropping during the spring
or summer will benefit from
being ploughed during the
winter and lightly harrowed.
Do not attempt to level the top,
and break all lumps, or clean
up half-buried grass with the
harrows. Frost and air have a
beneficial effect on roughly
turned ground, and the lumps
will break down easier after the
next ploughing. The grass and
refuse should never be taken
from the harrows and burned in
heaps if it can be turned in to
rot. If the ploughing of virgin
land, especially weedy country,
is hurried the soil is acid and the
crop may not grow properly.
“Bai”: Seeds which have very
hard shells, such as peas and
wattle seeds, should be soaked
in warm water before planting.
It is important that all seeds be
fully ripe before being gathered.
Seedlings should not be planted
out until frosts have ceased.
“Nubis”: A 12oz. bottle with
a rubber stopper can be fitted
up as a calcium boro-gluconate
injector. The stopper should be
pierced to take two tubes. An
inlet tube goes just through the
cork, and to the other end of
it is attached an air-pump (a
rubber enema syringe will be
suitable). An outlet tube goes
almost to the bottom of the
bottle. To this is attached about
3ft. of rubber tubing, terminating
in a No. 12 saline needle. When
air is forced into the bottle
(already filled with the solution)
the liquid is forced out and flows
freely through the needle.
“Ben Acre”: The whisker on
the seed of corkscrew grass is
highly inflammable. It will gather
in any' crevice, and around the
exhaust pipe of a car is one
dangerous spot. Regular clean-
ing, sometimes as often as every
half-hour when in heavily-seeded
grass, is the only safeguard.
Though it is otherwise safe to
drive in the grass, a car should
not be left standing where the
seedheads come against the hot
exhaust pipe. The seed gathering
in the radiator core will cause
boiling. Screens can be used, but
they also gather seed.
“K.N.”: A 44-gallon drum
needs proper preparation to be
satisfactory as a dog kennel.
For the summer, have it near
enough to a tree for the dog to
make use of outside shade. To
make it warm enough for winter
bank earth against the lower
portion and put in an earthen or
wooden floor.
“Nubis”; Best material for
car side-curtains is perspex. It
is strong, durable and splinter-
proof, and, being much lighter
than glass, will not “drag” the
back panel. The cost is about
Bs. per sq. ft. (l/16in. gauge),
and about 6 sq. ft. is required
(make a paper pattern before
buying). Cut with a tenon-saw
(a hand-saw will do, but use
carefully, as the splayed teeth
may crack the perspex). Shape
the curves on an emery-wheel.
The panels can be drilled and
hand-sewn, or held in special
rubber beading obtainable from
a motor trimming house or
simply glued in with a heavy
rubber cement.
“Bill C.”; It is false economy
to keep using a radio accumu-
lator when it has become so dis-
charged that it will only work,
the set for a few minutes at a
time. A wet battery will always
build up a bit while standing
idle, but its charge will soon
disappear when a drain comes
on it. Buckled plates are caused
by infrequent chargings; a
battery with a bulged top has
been neglected, and is well on
the way to the scrap-heap. Have
batteries recharged every six or
eight weeks whether they are
“flat” or not.
“M.A.T.”: After the apples
are picked, bend a piece of thin
wire like a button-hook and
probe into the forks and crevices
of trees. There the codlin makes
its home for winter, and every
one destroyed lessens the de-
struction next season.
“Radian”: When rubber-com-
position belts slip, burn a piece
of old motor-tube—not synthetic
rubber —and wipe it evenly over
the surface of the belt, putting
on as thin a layer as possible.
Use tongs or a piece of wire for
this purpose —burns from hot
rubber are very painful.
“Sundowner”: When laying
down a new lawn incorporation
of lioz. of lead arsenate to the
square yard with the top inch of
soil before sowing will proof the
lawn against grass-grub attack
for several years, after which it
may be necessary to repeat the
dressing.

without and want within rests on
her industrial capacity. The com-
bined production plants of C.D.D.
contribute greatly to Australia's
industrial security by making
the steel bodies and chassis com-
ponents for Chrysler, Dodge, De

their war record proves, to swing
swiftly and efficiently into much
wider fields when needed.

HT HEN, just when the “lug-
-1 gage” was beginning to look
as if it would soon be strong
enough, a direction was issued
to all shops to sell all goods un-
wrapped, in order to save paper.
It was a terrific blow to Jo and
the boys.
After a few days of pining
over his unfinished job, mutter-
ing some newer and more vehe-
ment condemnations of war in
all its ramifications, and hearing
almost unmoved of the shameful
death of Mussolini, Jo’s hopes
were raised again by the boys.
During the temporary absence
from the house of their mother,
they ransacked the cupboards.
She heard their shrieks of de-
light and came upon them undo-
ing the brown-paper wrappings
from the winter woollens which
she had put away for the season.
She tried to explain to them that
this was some special paper she
always used to keep out the
moths ; but they repudiated her
and all her excuses and rushed
out of the house to tell Jo that
there was plenty of luggage-
paper in the house.
They brought Jo down from
the workshop, looking eager and
hopeful again.
MRS. DENHOLM explained
apologetically that the
paper was her only defence for
her strictly-rationed woollens.
Jo understood the word
“rationed” and turned sadly
away, but the little boys howled
so much that they had to be
severely disciplined.
The boys refused to forget the
paper parcels. Twice they raided
the cupboard and got away with
a few pieces, and when their
mother locked it they came in
with an axe to break it open.
She told Jo about it at the next
mealtime, and Jo looked most
affected, though it was hard to
tell if it was because of the boys’
loyalty or the impossibility of
securing the paper.
He told her that he needed
“Buy more ten pieces,” and
when she counted her parcels
she discovered that that was just
the number she had.
She discussed the matter with
Alex, and after they had recalled
how much Maringoni had
wheedled out of them, and how
Jo had never asked for anything
of any value, they decided to
let Jo have the paper and to
trust to naphthalene. But Mrs.
Denholm did it with the utmost
misgiving.
“It’s only because he’s been
so good, giving me the picture,
and everything,” she said.
Jo finished the case with the
boys showing him how to do
everything ; pointing out all the
creases to be removed, and hin-
dering him a good deal with
their help. Then he gave it coat
after coat of varnish until it
gleamed smooth, firm and strong,
a credit to any travel-goods
manufacturer in any part of the
world.
Then there arose the problem
of fastenings. It was obviously
impossible to use the compara-
tively crude improvisations of
the old “iron” suitcase. Alex
tried all the stores in Waghurst
in vain; he wrote to a number
of firms in Sydney, and inquired
of travellers unavailingly. He
was told on every hand that they
were not being made, and that
the only hope of getting any was
to scour the big shops of Syd-
ney with a good story of despe-
rate need.
AT that time Alex had no in-
tention of going to Sydney,
but in order to sustain Jo’s flag-
ging spirits he promised him that
if he did need to go at any time
he would try for the fittings. A
lot of the zest went out of Jo’s
life. He spent a deal of time
brooding over his luggage. Once
he revived a little when he dis-
covered a piece of nickelled
metal, but the fastenings he
made from it, though quite excel-
lent, were discarded as being un-
worthy of the “luggage.” Jo
sank into a state of despondency.
He was apathetic and inclined
to quarrel with Maringoni.
Then Alex suddenly decided
that a number of accumulated
business matters needing atten-
tion warranted a trip to Sydney.
He assured his wife with some
asperity that Jo’s fittings had no-
thing to do with it, though he
might find time to look around
for them.
When he returned he had
everything that Jo needed, all of
the brightest and smoothest
nickel-plating, complete with
shining-headed rivets, and
moulded-leather guards for the
corners as well. Jo was delighted
and so were the boys and Mrs.
Denholm and all the prisoners
for miles around.
Jo put the fittings on during
the next week-end, and the boys
made him bring the “luggage”
into the house and show every-
one. Lots of prisoners called
to see it during the next couple
of weeks, and carried it about
to see how it would feel to be
travelling with such a “superbo
luggage.”
When the excitement was
dying down a bit Alex, coming
into the room unexpectedly on
a Saturday afternoon, found Jo
packing his clothes into it. It
need not have signified anything,
but Jo blushed and looked un-
comfortable. Then, on Monday
morning when Alex gave him his
working instructions, Jo stood
firm.
“Me no work,” he said.
ALEX stared at him, utterly
incredulous, and Jo looked
at him with a steady, defiant
resolution in his eyes, though he
did clench and unclench his
hands nervously.
“Scherzare?” Alex asked, still
unable to believe what he could
plainly hear and see.
But Jo, with a bleak look and
a shake of the head, assured him
it was no joke. And just because
they had all thought so much
of Jo, and imagined that he was
fond of them, Alex became more
angry than when any of the
others began to give trouble.
“No work; no eat,” he said
abruptly and walked away,
Mrs. Denholm refused to be-
lieve that Jo had earned his
punishment, and the boys cried
when they learned that Jo was
to have no breakfast; Peter
even attempted to take his plate
to him and had to be shut in
the bathroom. All the family,
and Ina, too, seemed to take it
for granted that Alex had caused
the trouble by losing his temper.
After breakfast Alex tried to
reason with Jo, but he could not
get through to him at all. He
asked Maringoni what the
trouble was, but Maringoni
could merely shrug his shoulders,
spread his hands, and say:
“No intelligenza, Jo.”
Then Jo opened up enough
to tell Alex that he had no
authority to punish him and de-
manded that he be reported to
Captain Pillory.
THE captain arrived in a very
black temper because he was
having more trouble than he i
could deal with. He had three
prisoners in the truck from out-
lying parts of his area who were
being sent back to Cowra for
punishment. He tried to brow-
beat Jo into a saner frame of
mind, but Jo, in his quiet, digni-
fied way, was adamant. So
Pillory shouted:
“Off to Cowra with him, too.”
Jo slipped into his room and
appeared again in a twinkling,
his shining new “luggage” on his
shoulder. The other three pris-
oners hunched in disgrace in the
truck sat up alert on seeing Hit.
They exclaimed in admiration;
they examined it minutely,
turned wondering faces towards
Jo and shouted congratulations.
The Control Centre men
gathered round and they were
amazed, too; even Captain Pil-
lory had a look and was grud-
gingly impressed.
Jo was beaming when he re-
turned for the remainder of his
gear; his face shone in happy
excitement when he said his “A
riverderci” to Maringoni, and
then to Alex, without a trace of
ill-feeling or regret.
Alex watched in amazement
as the truck drove off. Jo sitting
in the midst of the other
prisoners, the hero of them all;
one hand on the gleaming “lug-
gage” and talking volubly.

tripewriter in front of him, near
his chair a bucketful of black
coffee to keep him awake. Not
even the hottest and blackest
Mocha could have performed the
same office for his readers.
Piled on the table were his

would have been almost as dumb

certain whether it was the Rus-
sians, the English or the
Austrians who fought there, and
if they did defeat the French.
It would waste too much time
checking up, so he fed in an-
other sheet and started off his
description of the Test on a
different tack,
“Lindwall,” he hammered out,
“breathed fire and pawed the
sward, and a faint whinny was
heard from somewhere in the
gloom. Speculation was rife as
to whether this vendor of super-
sonic velocity had become the
victim of his own wares and had
been whisked by some giant un-
seen hand somewhere beyond
the stratosphere, condemned for
eternity to gallop the ethereal
pitch and send down bumpers
at passing planets.
“A clicking sound and the
rush of violently-displaced air
proclaimed that the Australian

bolics, cast himself at last in
the general direction of the

stout swords of a Spurius Lar-

bearing down from far horizons
to help him hold the bridge, the

performed a Nijinsky pas de trois

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid

W. M. Hughes
Something like a southerly buster hit
Cowra (N.S.W.) a short time ago with
the arrival of the Rt. Hon. W. M. Hughes,
C.H., K.C., M.P., aged 84, a living legend,
and still going strong.
He arrived by car about 6 p.m. on a
bitter night and made for the Services
Club, where there was a good fire, plenty
to drink and a host of young returned
men anxious to meet the old chap. Few
of them had as much as seen him before,
but all knew him as the Little Digger,
holder of the League’s Certificate of
Merit, and our World War I Prime
Minister, who plugged around through
France in a tin hat to see how his boys
were doing, and got his hand wrung off
year after year at all the Anzac marches
as a result.
If there’s one thing that characterises
Billy, it is that he knows without waiting
what he wants to do and say, and he
damned well does it and says it.
This time he strode up to the fire,
ignored the chair set for him, about-
turned and launched straight into a yarn.
As soon as he could get a word in, the
president (who had been fagging up
Crusts and Crusades) asked him what he'd
drink. “Not drinking now, thanks,” Billy
said, shook hands with everyone in reach,
and was out of the door and on his way
to the Rotary Club, where they had a
dinner and hot cup of tea waiting for
him —“No tea, thanks, but I could do with
a whisky and soda.” Rotary, always dry,
had left that side of it entirely to the
Services Club.
Billy is hardly likely to visit us again,
and we listened with more than ordinary
attention, there and at the public meet-
ing that followed. Not that you could
help but give your full attention. That
trim and lively figure, elbows in to the
side, the supple, quick gestures and the
gnarled old head —those things hold the
eye.
But what a master in the art of public
speaking! Every few minutes comes an
epigram (“Mr. Chifley’s current trouble
is that he thinks he is the fourth member
of the Holy Trinity”), with a constant
chuckle in between and a holding of
breaths wondering what in the name of
indiscretion he will come out with next.
The lilting Welsh voice is perfectly
pitched to the size of whatever hall he
is in, and sparkles all along with salty
wit, crusty courtesies and unexpected
fruits of learning.
Some points worth hanging on:
Only force will crush oppression; U.N.O.
has been an abject failure in Palestine and
in checking the march of Russia, while
Stalin speaks as a man with power.
The new era is upon us —where people
will have no right to their own destiny.
We are on the verge of totalitarian gov-
ernment. The Communists, a minority
power, tell the Labor Government where
it gets off —and it gets off.
The same crowd that pilloried me for
asking the people their opinion of con-
scription have introduced industrial and
economic conscription behind our backs.
He set off for Orange at 10 p.m. in a
car, a hot-water-bottle on his lap, snow
predicted ahead, and still talking.
He started his battle before most of our
fathers were born; and with nothing but
brains, guts and willingness to work.
Australians gladly made him their war-
time Prime Minister. Nowadays we
seem to prefer, pacifists, strikers and
“sports” to lead us. — Khasi Rokok
(N.S.W.).
Local Government
The proposal that the South Queens-
land municipalities of Southport and
Coolangatta, along with adjoining shires,
be “merged” to form a single locaf-
government area recalls an “amalgama-
tion” in the Tweed valley 18 months ago.
On January 1, 1947, Murwillumbah, a
town of 6500 people and one of the
wealthiest and busiest country centres in
N. S. Wales, became a. village. Its 44-
year-old municipality was abolished, the
municipal council being merged with the
Tweed Shire Council. This was done by
order of the Department of Local Gov-
ernment, and, despite overwhelming local
opinion against the amalgamation, the
townspeople were not permitted a voice
in the matter.
That, however, is only one example of
the present N. S. Wales Government’s
policy of reducing the number of local-
government bodies. More striking is the
Greater Sydney scheme, an enlarged
imitation of Greater Brisbane, where the
same policy is in favor. It seems to have
the approval of Socialist Governments
generally—in England Whitehall has
done away with the historic counties of
Westmorland and Rutland by “merging”
them with larger neighbors.
The aim of all these amalgamations
and mergers, according to the central
Governments which carry them through
—usually against the wishes of the people
concerned —is economy and efficiency in
local administration. The benefits, how-
ever, seem doubtful—many of Brisbane’s
400,000 people still hear the early-morn-
ing rumble of sanitary wagons, and Mur-
willumbah remains an unsewered area
under a shire council with a large over-
draft.
There might be another object. The
hundreds of local bodies—shire councils,
municipal councils, parish councils —act
as a check on the central Government.
These “little Parliaments” of practical
men cramp the style of a bureaucracy.
So bureaucracy tends, wherever possible,
to rid itself of them.
But whatever the aim, one ultimate
effect is beyond doubt. A large number
of small authorities will be replaced with
a smaller number of larger ones, less in
in touch with the people they represent.
This is drying-up democracy at its source,
and is especially dangerous in a country
like Australia, where concentration of
“Hurry up with the engine-inspection, Mary; We take of on
Walkabout at three o'clock
government and population is already a
major evil.
The New State Convention meeting in
Armidale (N.S.W.) on June 24 might
well give the matter some consideration.
—K. A.€. (N.S.W.).
Centralisation
Northern N. S. Wales towns are suf-
fering from the first effects of centra-
lisation so dear to the Chifleys and Mc-
Girrs. Electricity blackouts are almost
a nightly experience in many towns which
have been persuaded that it is cheaper
and less worrying to let someone else
provide their current from a bigger town
on a bulk basis.
If it is a hydro-scheme, out go the lights
and off goes the domestic and industrial
current when there is a dry spell which
lowers the water-horsepower. Steam-
driven plants fade out and plunge the
district towns and villages into darkness
the moment some part of the machinery
breaks, and this may sometimes last until
a new part is flown or shipped from the
other side of the world. Blackouts have
been a nightly occurrence for weeks
where I live.
What a lovely target any of the supply-
ing towns would be for an enemy rocket
or bomber in war-time. One on Burra-
jong and one on each of the plants that
are supplying domestic and industrial
power and light for the surrounding
towns would be enough.
Isn’t it time Australians realised that
if every town adopted the old and almost
forgotten principle of self-reliance in
industry, and disinterred some of the
pride and ambition of the old-timers, we
might have a chance to get back to the
old national spirit?—23ls (N.&.W.).
A
Free Medicine
Take liver extract for example—a life-
saving measure in pernicious anaemia.
Government doctors who drew up the
formulary recognise it is a necessary drug
and include it in the formulary, but only
to be used in ‘‘pernicious anaemia and
other megalocytic anaemias.”
Contrary to Government opinion, lead-
ing medical specialists in Australia be-
lieve that liver treatment will benefit other
cases—dropsy due to heart failure,
cirrhosis of the liver, etc., and a type of
dermatitis occurring in people with an
oily skin. This dermatitis can be very
serious, while the other diseases are
generally fatal, so it is important that the
patient receive correct treatment.
Specialists believe in the use of liver
for these diseases because they have read
of the work of reputable research men
such as Paket, Whipple and Morrison,
and because they have successfully tried
or tested the treatment on their own
patients. They believe that, by the use
of treatment including liver, they can
cure a disease which has hitherto always
been fatal, yet the disease does not come
into the class for which the formulary
allows the use of liver.
Thus we have two conflicting opinions
on the use of liver —that of the doctors
who compiled the formulary, and that
quoted here. True, liver is available for
any disease if the patient pays for it, but
we all pay social-service tax and, if we
are entitled to free medicine, surely our
physician and not the Government should
name the drugs.
This is only one of the arguments of
the doctors against the scheme in its
present form. If the Government would
allow all the medicines prescribed by a
doctor to be free the main objection to
the scheme would be removed, — Jock
(S.A.).
The High Court
“C.V.” should be concerned about the
Ministerial statement that bank nation-
alisation will be enforced by other means
if the present legislation is successfully
challenged (B. 28/4/’4B).
There are grounds for alarm in the
powers the Government already possesses
to nullify decisions of the High Court,
First, the appointment of Justices of the
High Court can be completely determined
by the Government; second, and most
important, there is no limit to the number
of members the Government may
appoint; and finally, should both Houses,
in the same session, petition the
Governor-General for removal of a
member of the High Court on the ground
of “proved incapacity or misbehavior”
the G.-G, may do just that.
Judging on present and past perform-
ances the “Government” would have no
qualms about invoking these powers,
Especially when the like of Ward and
Rosevear prate about the old age, etc.,
of some members of our High Court. —
L. W. (Vic.).
Stamp Revenue
New stamp issues do bring revenue to
a country (B. 2/6/’4B), but it is time
Australia devoted such revenue to a
special purpose. I’ve just received a letter
from the U.S.A. with a very artistic green
stamp depicting a heron against a back-
ground of saw-grass and palms and with
the words “Everglades National Park.”
America has recently set aside, as a
gigantic park and flora and fauna reserve,
417 square miles of the Florida Ever-
glades— a vast expanse of swamp and
rrook nalrm and forest the home of
creek, palms ana lorest, tne name or
innumerable birds and animals. To mam-
tain and patrol such a huge reserve and
to make it accessible to tourists, money
is needed, and by the issue of that special
stamp the Americans are raising a lot
of the necessary funds.
Every Australian State has similar
areas to develop. Tasmania has the
Central Scenic Reserve, Queensland the
Leamington Plateau, S.A. the great
Flinders Chase on Kangaroo Island. It
is estimated that a new stamp issue brings
at least £20,000 in clear profit in the form
of stamps which are never used on letters,
but which go straight into albums. Under
Chifley, any money raised in such a way
goes straight into already swollen
revenue \ distributed among the States
every year for the establishment and up-
keep of parks and sanctuaries it would
be a godsend. —H. A. L. (S.A.).
The Demons
Air Minister Drakeford’s statement that
“the Hawker Demons had gone in 1939
and the R.A.A.F. was in the middle of its
developmental scheme” (B. 26/5/.’48) is
wrong.
The flying service did not scrap the
Hawker Demons until late in 1940. At
the outbreak of war No. 21 Squadron
at Laverton was equipped with these
two-seater open-cockpit biplanes. Their
duties were limited, but every morning
one left at first light for the “weather
flip.”
I’ve flown in some cold places, but the
coldest yet was in an old Demon trying
to get it to 15,000 ft. for the daily
“weather flip” over Port Phillip Bay.
Early in 1940 the Hawker Demons
were taken from Laverton and sent to
Point Cook, where they trained the last
of the R.A.A.F. cadets. These included
many pilots who later became famous
and leaders of well-known R.A.A.F.
squadrons.
'Although Mr. Drakeford claims the
“home-grown Wirraway” was in produc-
tion in 1939, he does not mention that it
was not until the end of 1940 that this
single-engined fighter got into the service
in any quantity.
Many of Mr. Drakeford’s admirers
might believe his plea that the R.A.A.F.
was in the middle of its developmental
scheme in 1939, but old airmen will not.
Inclusion of Australia in the Empire Air
Training Scheme was the turning-point
of its development.— Waddlin’ Willie
(Vic.).
Root of tho Matter
When I buy chaff for stock feed, I
must find my own bags to put it in or
pay extra to have bags supplied. The
same with fertiliser. But, in selling wool,
I pay 12s. lid., plus freight, for each
woolpack used, and receive no rebate for
them. Soon after it changes ownership,
the wool is taken out and the bale sold
by the buyer. A large order means that
considerable profit is made on the packs.
On rare occasions when I am lucky
enough to obtain a few used packs from
local mills, I pay 6s. each for them the
second time. Still strong, they can then
be used for another consignment of odd-
ments, giving the buyer further profit on
yet another sale of the pack. — Eastern
(Vic.),
I know a number of prospective old-
age pensioners who have been scraping
together enough to buy a home so that
their pension days might be tolerable.
They have the money now, but, because
of exorbitant costs and material short-
ages, they can’t get a house. Meantime
their money prevents them from getting
the pension. They are growing too old
to work and will have to live on their
capital, * ending up with neither finance
nor home. Money saved for a home
should be allowed to go, say, into bonds,
to be earmarked for a home, and should
not debar the holder- from drawing the
pension,—G. A. B. (N.S.W-),
My wife and I (both chemists) were
amused at the remarks of “Country
Chemist” (B. 9/6/’4B) on petrol rationing.
He must be chasing business when he has
to “deliver urgent medicine at any hour,
day or night.” How much of it is really
urgent? I’m running a country pharmacy
and live nearly a mile from the shop. Our
hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. week-
days and 9 a.m, until noon on Saturdays.
There is very little after-hours trade.
“C.C.” should be thankful he has a car
of his own, and I’ve yet to hear of a
farmer who has to go short of a few
gallons of petrol. From the treatment I
received when travelling for a drug firm
I can only say that if you have a good
story sufficient petrol is forthcoming for
any trip.—R.W. (N.S.W.).

about that. His fury is almost homicidal.
But Hamlet, granted his premises, is
much more reasonable than any of the
crowd about him. It is this reasonable-
ness and the whimsicality of Hamlet’s
character which Olivier brings out with
the same deftness as he does with Richard
Hunchback.
Though Elsinore Castle nowhere looks
real except in a few stone pavements, all
the scenes in the first part have a tremen-
dous life about them, even the ghost
scenes if they are taken as projections
of Hamlet’s heated imagination. You
momentarily forget you are looking at
photographs that aren’t in the least bit
like Nature, and lose yourself in the
action. The whole thing suddenly col-
lapses into bathos, but rises to almost
magnificent heights of feeling ther next
moment. Olivier is at his best as an actor
in such scenes as when he picks up
Yorick’s skull and apostrophises it.' You
feel that he actually knew the old boy and
is genuinely sorrowing about him.
Olivier’s sound-track voice hasn’t quite
the beauty that it has in “Richard” at
the Princess, and he doesn’t dominate the
play to the same extent, because he has
provided himself with better support.
The Polonius of Felix Aylmer, the Queen
of Eileen Herlie, the Ophelia of Jean
Simmons and the King of Basil Sydney
are all admirably acted.
"Monsieur Verdoux."
Despite the absence of stick, mo. and
bowler, and despite a theme contain-
ing 20 murders, Charlie Chaplin in
“Monsieur Verdoux” (Melbourne Plaza)
is still the same old Chaplin. When he
recedes into the distance at the final cur-
tain you expect the little skip and the
lifting of the bowler, and if the film
were continued you’d naturally expect
the guillotine to miss him and get his
executioner. That’s the inevitable result
of a reputation.
Apart from that the film is a poor one.
Chaplin expresses a few good thoughts
at his trial, and he would seem to have
written the story to show up some of the
aspects of a social system which hangs
mentally-sick people. There is a sugges-
tion of pacifist propaganda. But he isn’t
a bit like Verdoux himself and apparently
has never observed the character he is
describing. His psychopath who, thrown
oft his mental balance by the depression,
takes to marrying and poisoning women
isn’t anything like a human, being. ■
The character is funny in the old
Chaplin manner when he gets one of his
wives out in a boat and attempts to
drown her, and he is the sentimental
Chaplin when he murders a few more
women in order to keep one of his
spouses, a cripple, and his child in com-
fort, and when he befriends a girl he
designed to poison.
Not being like life, and possessing a
“message,” the film is boring, and it is a
commentary on success that an actor who
has been 35 years in the business has
leapit so little of human nature.
Melbourne’s Little Theatre has been
decanting Constance Cox’s condensation
of “Vanity Fair” on to the tiny stage of
St. Chad’s, South Yarra. Human beings
are never as conscious of their asocial
motives as Becky Sharp, done by Bettine
Wildman, is in the curreiit adaptation, and
the Joseph Sedley of Eric Evans is as
much like life as a caricature by Row-
landson or Cruikshank. The resemblance
to caricature was emphasised by an arti-
ficial stomach, and made the courtship of
the Anglo-Indian nabob a spectacle which
was more repulsive than amusing.
The Cop and the Canary
At Mosman (N.S.W.) a widow was
charged with negligent driving because
her car hit a tree. The evidence showed
that she was driving post-haste to seek
veterinary help for her son’s sick canary,
which was in its cage on the seat beside
her; that her son (aged four) and her
father (aged 85) were in the back, that the
cage tilted off the seat, the child cried
out in distress and the widow, trying to
pick up the cage, soothe the child and
drive all at the one time, swerved into
the tree. Then the law appeared with his
notebook.
The magistrate, giving her the benefit
of the First Offenders’ Act, remarked
“Such an errand of mercy should not go
unrewarded.” Surely that thought might
have occurred to someone earlier in the
piece and the “culprit” been spared the
mental anxiety and legal expense of a
police-court charge, especially as no one
was hurt.
If the law had forgotten his notebook,
straightened the car’s dented fender,
patted the tree solicitously, driven the
lady home, helped bury the canary (which
had meanwhile died), told the child a
story to assuage his sorrow and had a
cup of tea in the kitchen with the family,
how much happier everyone would have
been.— Hist (N.S.W.).

Selling a House
“2312” (B, 26/5/’4B) sees things as a
potential buyer. How would he feel if
he were on the selling end of the trans-
action?
A friend of mine bought a house at the
end of 1941, the price being true to the
valuation of that time. Now he wishes
to sell up and go farming. The pegged
price given him according to Government
regulations is the 1942 value, and that
despite the fact that materials and labor
have risen considerably during the past
six years. To build another home of
equal value in the same locality would
cost £5OO more than the permissible
selling price of his present home—and
that doesn’t allow for the fact that the
land value has risen 100 per cent., and
that laid-out gardens and fruit-trees have
been added since 1942.
My friend can do one of four things:
(1) He can stay where he is; (2) he can
sell at pegged price, thus giving some
lucky man a present of £5OO-worth of
bricks, mortar and kind, and then take
himself and his family to the bush and
build a hut out of bush timber ; (3) he
can do a little private negotiating for
£5OO without a receipt and use the money
to buy materials on the blackmarket and
pay exorbitant freight charges 300 miles
north, thus enabling him to build a house
about half the value of his present home ;
or (4) throw caution to the winds and
give vacant possession to a non-Aus-
tralian with apparently limitless means
and make a small fortune.
As far as (3) is concerned he has many
friends living in one-roomed flats with
use of “mod. cons.” who would be more
than willing to pay over the £5OO, but
the Government condemns these unfor-
tunatesyto their one-roomed flats, as they
can raise finance only on the pegged price,
and have no hope of raising the necessary
£5OO to make a deal.
My friend is hoping the Government
will lift regulations, as that seems the only
way prices will find a true level.— Cass

Fire and Rabbit Controls'
By using a little commonsense and less
red tape some of our controlling depart-
ments would be of greater assistance.
Take our preventive measures against
bushfires. On a set date the ban on fire-
lighting is lifted without consideration of
circumstances or seasons. In Victoria
this year, despite drought conditions,
dangerous fire-hazards in the long, sun-
baked grass, sweltering heat and no likeli-
hood of better weather, the fire proclama-
tion was lifted on the appointed day.
The result was outbreaks of fire
in many districts. Misguided persons
lit their rubbish and campers and workers
lit fires for their tea billies under the mis-
apprehension that all danger was now
past. Their reply to protest was that the
ban was now lifted.
Much the same thing happens with
rabbits. A day is set for the wholesale
poisoning of the pest, irrespective of con-
ditions prevailing in districts. For many
weeks conditions may be perfect for
poisoning, but because the day is not
yet, the job is deferred. By the time it
arrives, rain has probably brought a fresh
shoot of grass and poisoning is then so
much wasted effort and expense.
Couldn’t it be left to district inspectors
and local authorities to set the most suit-
able dates in the districts concerned? —

TIMBER
By Ex-R.S.M.
Australia has • a lower percentage of its total area under forest than
any ot ler country in the world, and the position is worse than the figures
indicate, for much of the country officially described as “forest” is, in
fact, no better than poor scrub and the timber good for nothing save
firewood . The following conclusions are based upon a study which began
25 years ago and has covered the whole of Australia.
Western Australia has the wisest
forestry laws in Australia and a great
asset in the fact that the best of her native
timbers—karri, jarrhh, wandoo, etc. —
have a better natural regeneration than
any other type of eucalypt forest. The
bushfire risk is small in W.A. and the
terrain makes logging operations easy.
The only bad mistake was to allow
splendid stands of karri to be cleared for
dairying and fruitgrowing settlements,
and to allow the tallest of the karri trees
to be felled instead of retaining them as
a permanent asset in the form of tourist
attractions.
South Australia was originally the
poorest State in the Commonwealth as
regards natural forest, but by hard work
and initiative it now leads the rest in the
establishment arfd working of pine plan-
tations. Unfortunately, this conceptra-
tioji on planting one species of tree has
given the S.A. Woods and Forests Depart-
ment a Pinus radiata complex, which has
“Speak up and stop stuttering !”
led to missing great opportunities in other
directions.
Among them are: Neglect to replace
the useless, stunted stringybark native to
the quartzite country of the Mt.* Lofty
Ranges with the valuable jarrah; allow-
ing the extensive areas of box and lignum
flats along the Murray Valley to remain
of little economic value instead of plant-
ing them with swamp pines; failure to
establish plantations of shagbark hickory
and Canadian ash on the better soils of
the State’s south-eastern corner, and the
failure to include Port Orford cedar in
any pine plantations.
Hickory and ash have no rivals for
many uses; it was only timber from
Mediterranean ash —an inferior wood to
the Canadian species—growing wild from
seeds washed down a creek at whose
head was a small experimental planta-
tion which enabled Oliver’s tennis-
racquet factory to carry on during the
war. Cutting in hickory or ash planta-
tions can start when the trees are only
15 years old. Port Orford cedar is un-
rivalled where thin sheets of wood are
needed, such as battery-plate separators,
and the cutting can start when the trees
are 20 years old.
S.A. has also failed to do anything in
the way of establishing forests of the
W.A. salmon gum and gimlet mallee in
the drier northern areas to provide fire-
wood, posts and mining timber as they
do in their natural home on the W.A.
goldfields, where climate and rainfall are
similar. Specimens of all the trees listed
can be found growing well on private
property in the areas named.
Victoria’s main forest area lies in
Gippsland, but this area has the terrible
handicap of being liable to devastation
by the world’s worst bushfires. It would
pay to concentrate instead on the State’s
south-western corner, on country similar
to that used for the purpose across the
border in S.A. Here fire-control is much
easier and the bushfire hazard far less.
Tasmania shares with Queensland the
greatest forestry possibilities in Australia.
As far as replanting goes, the native Tas-
manian softwoods —Huon, celery-top and
King William pines—are so slow in
growth as to be hopelessly uneconomic.
Their place could be taken by planting
the Californian redwood in areas of good
rainfall subject to morning fogs as well,
the Douglak fir in wetter areas and the
Canadian spruce on the highlands. In
this way Tasmania could build up a soft-
wood-milling industry which would rival
that of Oregon, U.S.A.
N.S.W. might do best by concentrating
on the native hardwoods, of which it has
the best in Australia, but in this State a
vigorous replanting policy should replace
the present haphazard natural regenera-
tion of the valuable ironbark, spotted
gum, turpentine, etc.
Queensland has immense areas of rain
forest admirably suited to the growing of
valuable timbers. To a
casual eye there ap-
pears to be plenty of
timber still there to
keep the sawmills busy,
but a tour under the
guidance of a man who
knows the good timber
trees by sight soon re-
veals that nearly all the
good stuff has gone,
leaving those species
which, no matter how
impressive their size
may be, contain timber
of so poor a quality
that they do not pay to
cut. In the cut-over
areas of the Queensland
rain forests, natural re-
generation of utter rub-
bish like the red ash
tends to crowd out the
seedlings of maple,
cedar, walnut, kauruand
other really valuable
timbers. Experiments
have shown, however,
that if slasher gangs go
over the area to cut
down the rubbish, the
valuable trees then get
a chance to become the
dominant growth.
Queensland also continues to miss a
golden opportunity by failing to plant
big areas with Burma teak. There
is the needed alternation of wet and dry
seasons, and the flourishing experimental
plantation on the Atherton Tableland
shows what could be done with this, the
world’s premier boatbuilding timber. •
One of the worst blunders in Aus-
tralian forestry as a whole is the persistent
attempts to find among native timbers
substitutes for those with a world-wide
reputation for usefulness. There are no
substitutes for teak, greenheart, Port
Orford cedar, hickory, American white
pine, Douglas fir, ‘etc., and the sooner we
start growing the real thing the better.
In introducing such trees to Australian
forestry, there is also the chance that we
may find another parallel to Finns radiata,
which reaches maturity here in half the
time it takes in its native California.
. Modern bulldozing equipment has
made the work of clearing for replanting
a simple mechanical process; energy,
initiative and research, on the lines which
have proved so successful in the S.A.
pine forests, will overcome most problems
connected with the planting, care and
milling of trees. Useful timbers are one
of nature’s greatest gifts, and the world
grows shorter of them every day. The
only way in which we can ensure our
own supplies for the future is to do
exactly what is done in the case of any
other crop—select areas where the soil,
climate and rainfall are suitable for the
particular species, then prepare the soil,
plant the crop, care for it until maturity
and harvest it. Most of the really useful
timbers do not need good soils —only
climate and rainfall.
Forestry work provides a healthy out-
door life, interesting work and—for those
prepared to study—careers for young men
and women. If this country ever faces
another depression, there should be no
unemployment of the young and active —
they should be used to extend the forestry
work. It is a venture which only gross
mismanagement or some titanic Act of
God would prevent from showing a profit
in the long run. It would attract the
right type of immigrant. • .
If placed upon a national basis, how-
ever, forestry must not be blighted at
birth by having somebody appointed to
Canberra to “plan” it. That would lead
only to a repetition of the housing and
other muddles. It could all be done by
giving adequate backing and resources to
the existing State Forestry Departments
under the supervision of one practical
Federal forestry expert.
