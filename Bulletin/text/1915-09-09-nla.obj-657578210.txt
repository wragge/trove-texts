crowding, begin to go out. The doors are
burst open, and a flood of Black Maskers
pour into the ball. Lorenzo, trying to smile,
finds that he cannot. He discovers that lie
is wearing a mask, too. The scene ends
with the window being broken open, and
more Black Maskers pouring in—ends in
darkness and horror.
In the next scene Lorenzo lies in his
coffin, dead —and Lorenzo stands, dressed in
black, behind the coffin. The living Lorenzo
talks to the dead one, who, as is natural,
has nothing to say. His widow —or is it his
wife?—comes to weep over the corpse. The
scene is conceived in a mood of the bitterest
irony. Then once more we are shown the
great ballroom, where Lorenzo, now de-
mented, believes he is giving another masked
ball. He takes his servants and even his
wife for masked guests. He even asks his
wife to take off her mask. And this strange
play ends with the castle being consumed by
fire, Lorenzo dying in the flames.
The whole thing, of course, is an allegory
of the soul of man. Andreyeff tells us: “The
castle is the soul: the lord of the castle is
man, the master of the soul; the strange,
black maskers are the powers whose field of
action is the soul of man, and whose mysteri-
ous nature he can never fathom.” The sim-
ple maskers, the guests of Lorenzo, are ordin-
ary people; yet even these are transformed
and lose their real semblances, and, like the
black maskers, they become mysterious, in-
comprehensible and terrifying to Lorenzo.
The other Lorenzo is his other soul: this
recognition by Lorenzo of the duality of his
soul leads inevitably to insanity. Yet
Lorenzo, in that concluding scene, having
slain his double, the dark and evil elements
of his soul, has won through, has achieved
—only to perish at the moment of attain-
ment of his faith.
Even a reading of this play indicates its
tremendous power: it is a horribly modern
Hamlet. Its production on the stage must
have been a thrilling event.
The third play included in this volume,
The Sabine Women, is, we are told, a satire
upon a Russian political party. The Sabine
women, for instance, are “the constitutional
promises wrung from the Government by the
revolution of 1905 and 1906.” Our troubles!
The plain fact is that in The Sabine Women
this Russian dramatist has written a play
that might have been the product of Bernard
Shaw. It is twin to Androcles and the Lion.
It is a brilliant and delightful burlesque on
ancient history, witty and absurd. What
could be more Shavian than the stage direc-
tion for the beginning of the second act: the
grieving Sabine husbands, whose wives have
been forcibly abducted by the Romans, are
seen wrapt in gloom. “A part of the Sabine
men are engaged in gymnastic exercises.
As they move their arms they repeat with
rapt attention: ‘Twenty-five minutes’ daily
drill will banish every pain and ill.’ In the
middle of the stage, on a long bench, sit in
a row the husbands who have children. Each
one holds a baby in his arms. Their heads
droop wearily to one side, and their atti-
tudes dramatise despair.” The meeting be-
tween the Sabine husbands and their
abducted wives in the camp of the Romans
is delightful extravaganza. To the husbands’
surprise, their wives are quite content to re-
main with their abductors. Proserpina tells
one sorrowing, deserted husband that there
is only one means left to bring his wife back
to him. “Abduct her!” Marius questions:
“But will she come?” “How can she help
coming,” Proserpina replies, “if you abduct
her?” To his reply that to commit violence
would affront his legal conscience, Proser-
pina replies: “If I am to remain faithful I
want a strong man, the strongest man there
is. Do you think we are so fond of being
abducted and stolen, and asked back and re-
turned, and lost and found? I no sooner
get accustomed to one man than along comes
another, and carries me away, and I no
sooner get accustomed to the new man than
the old one appears and says: ‘Come back.’.
Really, if you want your wife to be your
own, then all you have to do is to be" the
strongest. Struggle for her tooth and nail.
In short, die in her defence. Believe me,
Marius, there is no greater joy for a woman
than to die upon the grave of a husband
who has fallen in her defence. And be
assured that a woman proves false only after
her husband has proved false.”
One wonders if Bernard Shaw knows
Russian ? Or is Shaw’s real name Andreyeff ?

The Russian Drama
Already we have mentioned a remarkable
play by Leonid Andreyeff, The Life of Man.
This play, with two others, equally aston-
ishing, is included in the volume of Plays
by Leonid Andreyeff (Duckworth, per Dym-
ock’s Library).
Andreyeff, like most modern Russian
authors, suffered in youth from lack of
means, and attempted to commit suicide.
In fact, he made three attempts to kill
himself, which suggests that the youth
was either remarkably lucky or remarkably
incompetent. He tried vainly to earn a
living by painting and by the law. That
wide haven, journalism, ultimately received
him; and from feuilleton writing he was led
to literature. It was Gorki, then at the
height of his fame, who “discovered” this
new genius. The publication of a small
volume of his stories made him famous.
His plays are extremely popular; they have
long runs in the theatres; and in the printed
form they have an immense sale. An edi-
tion of 18,000 copies of his drama, King
Hunger, reviewed long ago on this page,
was sold out in a single day.
Andreyeff declares that his plays are
panpsychic, “all thought.” He does not con-
sider action, in the accepted sense of move-
ments and visible achievements, necessary
to the theatre. We may translate his pan-
psychic drama as the psychological drama
of Maeterlinck, Barker, Shaw and the new
Repertory school. In illustration of his
thesis that modern drama tends to with-
draw farther and farther from external
activities and deeper and deeper into the
recesses of the mental life, Andreyeff con-
trasts the lives of two men of two widely
divergent centuries, Benvenuto Cellini and
Nietzsche. The life of the medieval artist
and adventurer is crammed with events.
“Cellini encounters more events in a short
walk from his home than the average mod-
ern man does in his entire life.... His life
is a personification of the older theatre.”
Melodrama is still medieval. There were in
Nietzsche’s life, there are in our lives, few
events, activities or physical acMevements—
unless, of course, we enlist. “The real
drama of Nietzsche’s life begins just at the
time when his life withdraws into the
silence and inactivity of the study.” That
is where the drama of modernity begins.
Andreyeff’s complaint is that the modern
theatre has never thrown open the door that
leads to the psychological experiences of
mankind. It is his life-work to unlock that
door. And in his plays he not only opens
that door, but he smashes it to pieces.
He does not imply that events have ceased
to occur —his dramas are crowded with
events; but the dramatic value of exterior
events has fallen. Life has become more
psychological. “Not love, nor hunger, nor
ambition, but thought in its sufferings, joys
and struggles, is the true hero of the life of
to-day.” Andreyeff’s last play is entitled
Thought. A bibliography of Andreyeff’s
dramatic and literary work covers so many
pages in this volume that he must be a man
of extraordinary productivity.
j*
The Black Maskers is a remarkable pan-
psychic drama, even for Andreyeff. A noble-
man, Lorenzo, is giving a great masked ball
in his castle. But when the invited guests
arrive in their disguises he is unable to
recognise anyone. He attempts to identify
one of his friends, Signor Basilio. The
masker addressed replies: “Signor Basilio is
not here. Signor Basilio is dead.” Lorenzo
laughs. “Why, he is as much alive as I
am.” The masker retorts: “Are you, then,
alive?” Another masker informs him that
she is his heart: her costume is a red one
with a black snake twined about it. More,
maskers arrive, and Lorenzo is the only one
undisguised. Soon his perplexity deepens;
he cannot find his servants, his jester, nor
even his wife. Everybody wears a mask.
Thinking he has identified his wife, he finds
two other masked women similarly disguised
and speaking with the same remembered
voice. Lorenzo begins to have grim doubts
about this seeming jest. Then the first of
the Black Maskers appears—“a strange, de-
formed creature like a living fragment of
darkness,” frightening even the other mask-
ers. Other Black Maskers steal in. A fright-
ened guest cries, “Uninvited guests are com-
ing?-” Another confronts a Black Masker.
“Off with your mask, sir!” He tries to pull
the black mask from the face of the stranger,
and springs back in terror, crying: “They
are not masked, gentlemen!’ In tbe. general
confusion everything is enveloped in dark-
ness.
In the next scene Lorenzo meets himself
in the castle tower. Both appear to be
Lorenzo; each in turn demands that the
other should unmask; each asserts he is
Lorenzo and the other an impostor. They
fight, and one Lorenzo kills the other.
Once more we are shown the ballroom, in
which there are now a number of Black
Maskers, “touching the white marble
columns with their black, hairy fingers.”
From the talk of the other maskers, who
are afraid of them, it seems that the Black
Maskers are strange creatures from the
night, attracted to the castle, like moths,
by the illuminations. One Black Masker
says: “I do not know who I am. Someone
lighted up the tower, and we came.” They
crowd round the fire, which immediately
begins to go out.
Lorenzo appears, with clothes torn from
his duel, and on his bared chest a large
blood-spot. A Black Masker says to him:
“You roused the whole night. Everything is
astir there, and now the night is coming
hither.” A voice cries: “All the darkness of
the night is transformed into living crea-
tures, and from every side they are coming
hither. Bar the doors.” The lights, around
which the shivering Black Maskers arc
The Bush through French Eyes
Things Australian occupy but little space
in the French reviews. Of late years one
recalls only a fantastic tale of the horrors of
Melbourne life in Fan, an excellent article on
Henry Lawson in the Mkbcube,. a notice of
Stevens’ Australian Anthology in La Piia-
J.ANGE, and a story or two by Paul Wcnz in
La Nouvelle Revue Fkaxcaise. So it is
pleasant to meet L’homme au soleil eou-
vhant by the, last named in one of the greater
reviews, La Revue de Paws for April and
May (per Angus and Robertson, Sydney).
“The Sundowner” is, I think, his first novel
and fulfils the promise of Contes Ausira-
liens (1911). In the case of a novelist
writing of xYustralia for foreign readers,
there is always a danger lest the story
should be clogged by overmuch local color;
but Paul Wenz has avoided this pitfall, and
Ms story carries its exposition of Austra-
lian conditions, custom and slang, with ease
to a natural close.
The plot is simple, and for us the interest
lies in the treatment of bush life by a
Frenchman, whose intimacy with his sub-
ject has not blunted his sense of contrast
nor his power of observation. This latter
quality seems occasionally at fault, as when
the author lets us infer such an unusual
proportion of Irish people in his mining
town. And who ever heard of am Irish boy
named Betts? But there’s quare things in
the bush. Possibly he is the result of one
of these mixed marriages. In the matter of
dates, too, the book is puzzling; M. Wenz
has apparently synchronised events and
types of the early ’9o’s with those of later
years.
The hero, Harry Preston, Englishman, is
refused by an Australian heiress wliom he
has followed to Sydney, wastes his substance
in despair, and takes to the track, which
ultimately, after many turns, .leads him to
the original girl. On the road he encounters
Alf Lambert and Tom O’Neil, who befriend
him and try to teach him the ways of the
sundowner. Alf is a philosopher and mis-
ogynist, who early left home, vexed by too
much piety, “to see what sin was like.” In
the bush he finds shelter from the three
plagues of man —work, worry, woman —and
can there “take life in little spoonfuls with-
out bothering whether any will be left in
the bottle for the morrow.” His mate Tom
would agree with this formula, with a reser-
vation as regards the third plague. Tom,
born on “The Rocks,” was driven outback
as the result of a push row, is fascinated by
the road, but is still attracted by any little
bit of skirt (morceau de jupe). In their
travels the three rub against bush types
such as the publican, the distrustful station
storekeeper, the prospector, the teamster,
and many of their own kind. These are
familiar to us, but are introduced to French
literature in the work of M. Wenz with
understanding, sympathy and humor.
For the swagmen M. Wenz has many an
admiring word: “These swaggies were all
dirty, with the dirt of the bush, which is not
the filth of the town, for it is combined of
dust and mud, it smells of eucalyptus and
tbe smoke of camps Their poverty is a
poverty of the open air. Their very fleas
would not consort with hotel fleas. Their’s
is the aristocracy of poverty; they levy trib-
ute rather than ask for alms.... Australia
is a land of Canaan which feeds them and
will feed them till the end of their days.
They have, in a manner, the halo of the
traveller of old times, who was always a
welcome guest. Their welcome is no longer
so hearty nor so earnest; it has become
rather a duty.”
His appreciation of the “alluring soli-
tude, wild beauty and monotony of the
bush” is tempered by the persistence of flies
and mosquitoes. He misses the mental and
material background of older countries; Cap-
tain Cook, Peter Lalor and the bushrangers
are a poor substitute for the far-stretching
tradition of his own land: “This continent,
geologically one of the most ancient in the
world, is too new for the white man. It has
no history. The primitive legends which
peopled its lonely spaces have perished with
the native tribes.... ruins which are the
tangible past, old castles, old temples which
form such a rich part of a people’s history,
all these are wanting to Australia... . the
only ruins in the bush are the armies of dead
giants, slain by the axe of man, who
destroys a forest to feed his sheep. These,
indeed, are beautiful, by night when the
moonlight whitens their great" gaunt skele-
tons ; or at evening when the setting sun
bathes them in rosy light, and clouds of
screaming cockatoos perched on their naked
branches transform them for an instant into
monstrous almond trees in blossom.”
J. J. Q.
Max Stlrner
-i" the ranks of rebel philosophers Max
S liner occupies a conspicuous place. Hen-
rik Ibsen is his literary descendant, and i
thought is alleged to have influenced Treitz-
schke and the von Bernliardi school of
dreamers. Anyhow, he is the ethical parent
ot .Nietzsche who, however, was only on
listening terms with his father. And Niete
sche had a large, ready ear for Stirner’s
teaching as the researches of FriedrS’s
txiend, Overbeck, bear astonishing witness
Stirner, whose real name was Johann fas!
ivnft SC w. ld r n W ? S at Bayreuth, in
i S() 6. He died m Berlin in 1856. Apart
nom his intermittent starvation and his
reckless marriage with a lady named Marie
Dahnhardt who after his death, visited
Australia, married a laborer, and became a
washerwoman, Stirner’s life was singularly
uneventful. He was a mild, abstemious
character, congenitally shiftless and self-
effacing, and had the pallid-eyed myopia of
the typical leu ton pedagogue. For several
years lie found, life easy in the refined atmo-
sphere ot a girls’ school, but improvidence
and incapacity twice cost him imprisonment
for debt. Yot behind the meek eyes of this
small professor was the soul of a slinking
Superman. Between 1843 and 1845 lie pub-
lished his astounding effort, The Only One
and His Property, which many subsequent
Anarchists probably set to the music of
dynamite.
Now this anarchistic book, known in
English as The Ego and His Own, is not a
great work, nor is Stirner a commanding
writer. If he had been a real craftsman he
might have achieved the Nietzschean dis-
tinction of becoming a Penny Dreadful to
the Great Unread. But Stirner lacked the
manner of the litterateur and the physical
resolution of a vigorous heretic. He could
not translate his message, like Bakunin,
into the melodrama of pistol and poison.
Nor could he, like Nietzsche, sacrifice sense
to the beguiling sound of beautiful words.
Yet admitting his premises, Stirner’s argu-
ment is consistent, Nietzsche’s never. That
explains "why Stirner is never entertaining,
while reading Nietzsche is like a tour
through Chaos on a char-d-bane. Still, with
all its literary deficiencies, the book has the
sure note of revolution, sustained with a
staccato intensity that seems a new kind of
idiom. “Might is right,” exclaims Stirner,
bawling to an attentive Teuton posterity.
And Might is an abounding Egoism seeking
Satisfaction by the amiable principle of
force, majeure. The wayback French King
who said “-The State is I” gave Stirner the
material for the modern Kaiserism, “I am
the Universe.” Listen to Max: —
What you have the might to be you have the
right to be. I deduce all right and entitlement from
myself; I am entitled to everything that I have
might over. I am entitled to overthrow Zeus,
Jehovah, God, etc., if I can; if I cannot, then these
gods will remain in the right and in the might as
against me Away with every business that is not
altogether my business I You think at least the
“good cause” must be my business? What good,
what bad? Why, T myself am my business, and I
am neither good nor bad. Neither has meaning for
me. What is divine is God’s business; what. is
human, Man’s. My business is neither what is divine
nor what is human; it is not what is true, good,
right, free, etc., but only what is mine; and it is no
general business, but it is—unique, as I am unique.
Nothing is more to me than myself.-
Stirner rejects all authority, gods and
moral values. He admits the institution of
property only under the following condi-
tions :
Property should not, and cannot, be done away
with; rather, it must be torn from ghostly hands
and become my property; then will the erroneous
consciousness that I cannot entitle myself to as much
as I want vanish —“But what cannot a man want?”
Well, lie who wants much, and knows how to get it,
has in all times taken it to him, as Napoleon did
tho Continent and the French Algeria. Therefore,
the only point is that the respectful: “lower classes’
should, at length, learn to take to themselves what
they want. If they reach their hands too far for
you, why defend yourselves.”
Other extracts could be given, but those
are sufficient to indicate the material of the
grim, philosophic garment that Stirner
wove, so to speak. Nietzsche coming more
than a generation later cut this garment
to the needs'of a ballet dancer, and still left
sufficient stuff for a winding sheet. Stirner-
ism was too much for Nietzsche. It gave
him the idea for The Transvaluation of All
Values and Beyond Good and Evil, and drove
him to create the mountebank Zarathustra
who showed appropriate gratitude by wor-
shipping his maker. Nietzsche is now com-
paratively dead, but Stirnei' is becoming
very much alive.

The 3 11. P.. 2-speed. Free Engine ROYAL ENFIELD is positively the BEST
MOTOR CYCLE that money will buy. It embraces features which are not
to be found in other makes.
LUBRICATION. —There are no hit or miss methods in the Royal Enfield
system —it is automatic. When the engine is running there is a continuous
circulation of oil, thoroughly lubricating each cylinder.
THE POWER UNIT. —There is no more reliable power unit than the 3 lI.P.
standard engine, which has a bore and stroke of 60 mm. and 75 mm., respec-
tively, giving a capacity of 425 C.C. On this capacity enormous power is
developed.
THE ENFIELD SILENCER.—This has two expansion boxes of ample
size, effectually and efficiently silencing the exhaust.
THE ENFIELD 2-SPEED AND FREE ENGINE COUNTERSHAFT
GEAR is unquestionably the most reliable gear fitted to any motor-cycle. All
parts are easily “get-at-able.” Chain drive is fitted throughout.
THE ENFIELD CUSH DRIVE HUB is a shock-absorbing device that is
remarkably smooth and supple.

Rifle And Pistol Cartridges
When you buy rifle and pistol cartridges you want
them to be sure-fire and accurate, and to have the
proper speed and penetration—qualities which are all
essential for good shooting. There is nothing in the
appearance of a cartridge that indicates whether
it does or does not possess these qualities, for the
elements that make them cannot be seen. Therefore
when buying you have to rely upon reputation.
Winchester Rifle and Pistol Cartridges enjoy the
highest reputation the world over for quality and
reliability. When you buy, if you will insist upon hav-
ing Winchester make you can feel confident of getting
cartridges which are sure to give the fullest measure of
shooting satisfaction. Look for the Won the box. It is
THE MARK OF CARTRIDGES OF KNOWN
REPUTATION AND PROVED QUALITY.

actress who played the distin-
tinguished role of Virginia Blaine in
the thrilling drama, “Bought and

i tieatre, as understudy to the great
American actress, Muriel Starr,
this season, writes her opinion of
a great medicine, which she de-
scribes as
Clements
Tonic
The Great Restorer.
“Keep the nerves sound. That is my advice to those who folJow the
profession. I have not found a better medicine than Clements Tonic,
and I have tried many. It has soothed my irritated nerves and given me
sound sleep, and improved the general state of my health. It is good
because it does good.”

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause —and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache, _ rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
' f URIC ACID CRYSTALS
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid
of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

STOP
SMOKING!
MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it up
is to tempt death by Heart Disease, Nervous
Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and Stomach,
Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the
habit for good. It not only destroys the crav-
ing, the desire, the appetite for tobacco, but
restores to health the entire nervous system,
and aids nature in entirely eliminating from
the system the Nicotine Poison.
You Can Try It FREE.

has yet to be discovered. This
famous British remedy is also
recommended by Medical Men in
cases of Lumbago, Sciatica, Eczema,

Disorders.
KRUSCHEN AT THE FRONT

quantities of Kruschen Salts have been ordered
by, and delivered to the British Authorities, for
the use of the British Forces overseas and in
the Base Hospitals at Home. Kruschen Salts
are prescribed by Medical Men the world over.
THE WORD KRUSCHEN

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Lagoon.
If you wander the long beach by night
Where the tall breakers comb to their fall,
And the moon sheds her magical light
In a glamor of white over all,
And a ship on the distant sea shows
(As she floats through the mystical scene)
A side-light as red as a rose,
Or a side-light of emerald green,
You will come in a long league or so
To a silver-lit, hidden lagoon,
Where the tides of the sea never flow
Or ebb at the call of the moon.
It is choked, silted up, at its mouth,
And seldom its waters break forth;
A dune of white sand to its south
And a darkness of scrub to its north.
And there (if you muffle your feet
And bide in the tea-trees) anon
You may see, sailing on, like a fleet,
Black swan in the wake of black swan.
And it may be a mullet will leap
All silver of tail and of fin,
And the waters awake from their sleep,
And the ripples like dancers come in.
And then, as the bright ripples dance
And the weeds on the shoreline are stirred.
You will hear in the distance, perchance,
The song of a hidden night-bird.
It will float from the back of the dune.
And thrill you, and charm you, and hold;
For the notes of that night-haunting tune
Will be magic and music and gold.
And then, when the night-bird grows mute —
All still is tlie shining lagoon—-
A beetle (a bat in pursuit)
May drone in the light of the moon.
And it may be, by bending your ear,
Your fancies and senses astir,
Alone in the dark you will hear
Subtle movements of feather and fur.
The cry of a thrush that awakes
To the green of death’s eyes in the gloom;
Or the pad that the spotted cat makes
As it creeps, certain-footed as Doom.
Or it may be ’twill be the far howl
Of a dingo the dark will betray ;
Or the velvet-soft, wings of an owl
As it swoops through the night on its prey.
And thus, as you hark to the strife
Around and about and above,
You will say : “Here is death amidst life.
Where alone should be beauty and love.”
And then, like a voice faint and far,
The sea with a chant that annoys
May tell of a man’s world at war
And the beauty and love it destroys.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
In the Whin.
I wouldn’t go out iu the whin at night
The way that sister goes,
For I saw the dance of a blue corpse-light
And the grass was hidden in fog bands white,
Yet she’ll no be heedin’ those.
For out by the lean of the climbin’ fir,
In the murk of the cattle byre,
Somebody whistled a call to her
And I saw the plaid on her bodice stir
And her cheek put up its fire.
A slopin’ roof has our attic room
And a bit of a smokin’ light,
A yellow halo to break the gloom,
And it showed her fine as a gowan bloom
When she slipped to the whin to-night.
Our mither has lain in the auld kirkyard
Five year with my feytlier’s kin,
And my. feyther is dour and aye works hard,
For he left his smile in the green kirkyard
At my mither’s bury in’.
And little he cares for a maid’s desire
And little of maids he knows,
But his wrath would burn as a kil-n fire
If he knew the tryst by the cattle byre
And the path that sister goes.
I wonder if she has coaxed a charm
From the black-eyed, wrinkled witch.
Or what she has found to keep her warm
And brave to ghosties and safe from harm
Where the daftie corpse-lights twitch.
I ken she has set her Bible high
On the nook-shelf many a day,
And she watches the kirk folk straggling by
With a mocking lip and a wistful eye,
And I never hear her pray.
The moon lifts over the orchard wall
Like a dusty lantern’s light;
Her pillow bides empty. . . .no latch’s fall. ..
But far in the heather a screech-owl’s call
Comes over the whin to-night.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Things I Do Not Know.
My little boy at evening comes
To clamber on my knee.
And asks about so many things
That he bewilders me;
And as his oueries come and go,
I learn the things I do not know.
Though rags and tags of many things
I carry in my brain.
To satisfy his eager quest
My answers are in vain.
Why follows why in constant flow
To show the things I do not know.
With Smith or .Tones, or Brown or .Tames
On many things I spout;
They think that I am well-informed
And gravely hear me out;
But every night at six or so
I learn the things I do not know !

BUCK UP!
In the beginning the Commonwealth was
creeping with frothy persons who rearranged
the map of Europe, indicated the exact spot
where the Kaiser was to be hanged, and fixed
the execution and general clearing-up for a
date in the near future. Now that things have
not progressed entirely according to the speci-
fications which they made for themselves with
the worthy assistance of the Censor’s office,
many of those who were wont to froth have
started to moan. The enthusiast who used
to throw his hat in the air with joy when his
daily paper told him that the German army
had been routed again, has begun to say in
his depression that the enemy is too well
organised for us to defeat him. This person
is beginning to be concerned about his securi-
ties. The thought of the British Navy no
longer thrills him as it did when he pictured
the fleet bombarding Heligoland, and surging
on to Kiel and Hamburg. The army has not
fulfilled his expectations by kicking the Ger-
mans across the Rhine to the , sound of a
good old British cheer. Nothing has hap-
pened quite as he anticipated, and his heart
is a little sore and his feet a trifle cold. It
is not claimed that he exists in vast numbers,
but there are certainly enough of him to make
an easily-discerned mark on the social land-
scape, and the effect of his dismal wails is as
pernicious as his flamboyant confidence was a
year ago.
In point of fact, the position of the British
Empire is so good, after 12 months of war-
fare, that it is an embarrassment to discuss it
with an intelligent ally. The Germans have
the advantage of position on the European
Continent now as they had when their armies
settled down last year behind the Marne; but
they are not so near their main objective—
the overthrow of Britain —as they were two
months ago ; and by all appearances they can
never get so near again. The road to Calais
is a necessary by-path on the long, long way
to London, and unless the military scientists
err, it has been rendered impassable. There
are trenches between Nieuport and the
French border such as the most imaginative
engineer-officer never pictured to himself
before this war began, and if, at devastating
cost in men, they are taken, there is still, so
far as Britain is concerned, the Channel.
The moment for the invasion of England, if
jt ever existed, has passed. The still sum-
mer days and nights have gone, and in a
little while the equinoctial gales, in which
the cumbrous Zeppelins cannot live, will have
arrived. _ The submarine campaign, which
was to insure the success of a landing in
England by sea, is a failure —an admitted one
if the new German attitude towards the
U.S.A. and the slighting by the Kaiser of
Yon Tirpitz go for anything. An Admir-
alty device has caused the seas around Britain
to be death-traps for enemy submarines,
and the Germans have apparently wearied
of losing costly ships and highly-trained
crews to no warlike purpose. Germany has
long since passed its highest point of effici-
ency—a remark which applies also, unfor-
tunately, to the whole of its enemies, barring
Italy, on the Continent—-but Britain was
stronger in August than it has been since
the war started, and its power is increasing
daily. If a German army had had the
incomparable luck to get a footing in Eng-
land this time last year, it might have had
a lighting chance for its life. If the impos-
sible happened, and it got there now, its end
would be certain and awful.
* *. * . *
It is true that the Russian steam-roller
has not proceeded to Berlin in the manner
expected of it. If the rate at which it is
being pushed in the wrong direction is any
criterion it will never see Potsdam. But
there are compensations. The enemy of the
civilised world is destroying itself in the
effort to destroy Russia, which is indestruct-
ible ; and meanwhile the Britisher, who is
able to regard the progress of the war with
the cold and far-seeing eye of the business
person, may console himself permissibly with
at least one reflection. If Russia had been
as strong as the blitherers averred and
hoped, if it had been capable of routing the
land-forces of what everybody regarded as
the world’s greatest military power, it might
have been well for the Allies’ cause, but it
would probably have been ill, in the long run,
for the British Empire. National aspira-
tions live longer than the most firmly welded
alliances. At the end of the war Britain’s
hold on India and British interests in Persia
would have been in no wise strengthened by
the circumstance that Russia, in addition to
its natural resources and its strength on a
population basis, was efficient enough in the
military sense to over-run Western Europe.
These are natural and obvious sentiments
which need not conflict in any way with
sympathy and warm admiration for a brave
ally. Similarly there is no escaping the fact
that while Continental Europe is being
bankrupted of men and trade, Britain is
doing business more or less as usual, while
the casualty lists have barely affected so far
the fringe of its men-power. This is not in
any sense Britain’s fault, though the mad-
dened Teuton would naturally like the world
to think that it is. Its navy is so strong
that no one can face it; its army, which was
raised by voluntary methods, is still so raw
that for the most part it can face no one.
The regular British Army went cheerfully
to its doom the moment the neutrality of
Belgium was violated, and the Territorials
have followed. But Kitchener’s army of
three millions or more continues to be trained
and augmented, and it is going to supply the
men who will end the trouble.
* * * *
Here, then, are a few plain facts for the
calamity-howlers and for those who would
encourage Germany to now talk of peace
terms. The Empire’s sea-power, which was
in question five years ago, and from then
onwards till July, 1914, is shown to be abso-
lute. The German navy has been exposed
as the most ruinously bad investment in
history. Britain has begun to acquire
the two virtues which it most needed—
sobriety and economy. Intra-Imperial rows
have been either ended or patched up for
the currency of the war. Irishmen, Boers,
Indians —all are struggling fraternally for
the common end. Class feeling, which all
the palliative legislation of the Radicals was
doing little to stem, has died wholesale on
the battlefield. Barnacles, from the Party
system to the;, superstition that a working-
man couldn’t become a useful officer, have
been dropping off the ship of state to its
ultimate great benefit. And the nation con-
tinues to be a gigantic manufacturer and
trader. The measure of the Empire’s strength
is the world’s weakness. When this war is over
no European nation except Britain, sitting
inviolate and inviolable behind the Channel,
will be in a position to handle the biagest
undertakings. For example, the administra-
tion of Turkey. Seapower; Britain’s ad-
vantage in being guarded by a moat; cer-
tain lucky chances, such as the circumstance
that Germany decided on war before the
invasive air-craft had arrived —these are
some of the factors which promise to. still
further swell the Empire. Emphatically
there is nothing in the situation to squeal
about.
NATIONAL SERVICE.
Senator Lynch looks the big question in
the face: —
Dear Bulletin,- —Between voluntary service and its
alternative there is no compromise, no neutral ground
where the perplexed theorist may harmonise the
virtues of both extremes and indicate a middle course.
It is either voluntary? service based on individual
choice, or national service which leaves the individual
no choice.
Our present system is a British inheritance, having
a definite starting point, but which long usage has
changed from an accident to a principle. Had the
British Isles, instead of being encircled by a friendly
sea, been jambed up to the European mainland, with
its rulers never free from the nightmare of invasion,
we would probably never have heard of a voluntary
army. Chance circumstance, therefore, has exalted
voluntary service towards the level of a moral virtue.
Its advocates think it is Truth itself, and any rival
scheme must originate in mental darkness. On
closer examination, however —and it is only in war-
time the supreme test can be applied and results
brought strikingly home —-this sturdy relic of mouldy
medievalism reveals itself as an impostor and a
fraud —as big a fraud as the twin superstition that
“an Englishman’s home is his castle.”
In Australia respect survives for the volunteer
method, doubtless due to hereditary influence, though
the average person seems unaware or unmindful that
for the purpose of Defence it has been struck out of
our plan. Conscription is written in bold characters
in our Defence law to-day. There it stands by popu-
lar choice, as silently enacted as the movements of
the gods who were shod in wool. To apply the prin-
ciple of that law to the conduct of a war waged in
Australia and deny it to the present death-struggle in
Europe suggests one of at least two awkward conclu-
sions. Either Australia has but an incidental in-
terest in the distant contest and adjusts its attitude
accordingly, or it has a vital interest, but has no
faith in its own matured policy. The first finds its
contradiction in the all-pervading opinion on the war.
The second cannot be seriously urged. How then
can the impasse be dodged? Only by the conclusion
that Australia identifies the Allies’ cause as her own,
but has not yet screwed her determination to the
point where effort should match her deep understand-
ing of the position.
Are we doing our share, then? Recalling the
primitive and chaotic attempt at effective defence so
late as five years ago, this country has already earned
a long chapter in the annals of military achievement.
But comparing our quota of 100,000 men not yet
mustered with Britain’s reputed 3,000,000 trained
men, we are seriously under-insured, and need to
more than double our efforts to avoid the reproach
of shirking our part. It is clear that unless volun-
tary enlistment gives unexpected proof of its efficacy,
and does it at once, national service is inescapable if
this country keeps in the war and resolves to bear its
due share of the burden.
But conscription! No, not conscription! Con-
scription shocks a lot of people who are joyously un-
conscious of its virtual operation around them, where
hosts of young men are being discharged and plainly
told to go and enlist. Conscription they detest on
account of its birthplace, as though the Britisher had
always lived a segregated existence and never bor-
rowed for the chief elements in his national life.
The truth, on the contrary, is he has been so in-
veterate a borrower that much of himself is Con-
tinental. The foundation of his laws is Continental;
likewise a great part of his language and literature.
His architecture is wholly so, while his wearing
apparel never gets the proper hang until the
despised foreign touch is applied. Even at meal time
he discards native fashion and prefers alien language
and style. Being such a borrower of foreign condi-
tions that change, the wonder is that he balks at
borrowing a thing that is so well approved that it
has undergone least change of all.
Again, conscription is against the “genius” of the
race. It is true the manhood of Britain as a whole
has given a magnificent response to the call of duty.
It is equally true a big section of it has not done
so. Women in thousands (honor to them !) are going
into laborious and dangerous occupations—-including
harvesting, ploughing and mechanical control —to
free the nobler animal for his fit and bounden duty.
Yet the noble animal hesitates. The “genius” of a
race that permits such hesitation in the face of all-
round superhuman sacrifices has outlived its useful-
ness, and ought to be locked up under the Vagrancy
Act.
It is such sentimental objections as these that have
for ages put conscription outside practical discussion.
Alongside may be placed some of its positive advan-
tages.
Conscription as a means of mobilising a nation’s
fighting strength is equitable, scientific and patriotic.
It begins with the recognition that a country’s
defence is the duty of the physically fit male' popula-
tion living in it. The man who is not prepared to
take his allotted part should be not in it, but out-
side it. National defence, being a common duty,
knows no self-elected privileged class. We inake no
such distinctions in the comparatively minor activities
of civil life. A citizen must join in a common scheme for
defending the community against invasions of disease.
But when his country is in jeopardy from an armed
enemy he is told that he can please himself about
defending it. Compulsory service reverses that order.
It cancels the individual’s pleasure, and so adjusts
the burden than an equitable balance is maintained
on the shoulders built to bear it. The system is
scientific, ensuring the methodical assembling of the
nation’s fighting strength, and enabling that strength
to be used without waste of blows. The fatal element
of uncertainty in raising reinforcements is removed,
and the cruel sacrifice of life in launching a slender
force against overwhelming odds is minimised. The
volunteer system is uncertain and unreliable, and
dangerous because it is both.
And the services of married men would not be
accepted until dire necessity demanded it. In Aus-
tralia there are now about 12,000 fatherless homes
that need not be. As to the number of dependents that
will be thrown on the State for maintenance, and the
varied effects of such a vast multitude so circum-
stanced, it is unhappily premature to speculate. But
with 500,000 single men of military age and a sane
policy in operation, the injurious economic and social
effects produced by this large and growing draft on
our married population could be obviated.
Finally, conscription makes an equal levy on all
shades of patriotic feeling. If there is one thing that
a nation needs to jealously guard it is the spirit of
its people. Courage, fortitude and the other natural
virtues, with honesty as the seminal element, make a
national character of an enviable type. The slopes of
Gallipoli bear witness to our success in approaching
that type. Compared with it, the fertility of soil,
mineral riches or teeming millions of people are
deceptive guides to a nation’s might. It is on this
golden national asset that the vicious, stupid volun-
tary system lays excessive toll. The brave, fearless,
patriotic spirits are beckoned onward to be sacrificed
to the Moloch of war, while the indifferent or selfish,
sluggish or cynical, remain at home in safety. Is it
a wise policy that makes such a suicidal drain on our
best blood? How can the spirit of the race be main-
tained at high standard if its best constituents are to
be deliberately marked for destruction, and the race
propagated from the inferior remainder? It can-be
done by reversing the laws of heredity, not other-
wise.
Even at this advanced stage the call is to the
people to lay aside their reverence for old shibbo-
leths and brace themselves for the task of performing’
their full part in the war, until an honorable and
lasting peace is secured, with justice to our com-
rades in the struggle, and justice to the future of the
race. —P. J. Lynch.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Buying Back Australian Soil with P.N.'s
Apparently the new doctrine will be that
as Australia floated many loans before the
war to keep men employed and launched
God knows how many more to send men
away to fight, things would be nicely-
rounded off by liberating a large supply
when the soldiers come marching home.
For a start the Federal Government
has invested J. C. Watson with a
roving commission to organise employ-
ment for the returned men. Without
question there is useful work for
Watson to do in this direction. Accord-
ing to a statement he made in Sydney the
other day, he seems to intend impressing
upon the State Governments the wisdom of
making land available for his new charges.
The N.S.W. Government is stated to be sym-
pathetic and ready to do something—with
a p.n. The idea given expression to is that
the dreadful old humbug of buying out big-
landowners should be put into operation,
and the areas so acquired cut up and thrown
open to soldiers. In other words the State
Governments are to enter upon a huge
scheme of land resumption with long-dated
bills. Which means an inflation of land
values against the public, the lining of land-
owners’ pockets with gold, the creation of
more mortgage-ridden cockies, and huge
additions to the public debt.' If Watson
is to go round Australia counselling
public policy of this sort, he is going to do
no good either for his friends or the soldiers
or for the people who are not soldiers. Every-
where they have been tried these easy-looking
schemes of land resumption have proved
not only futile but a cause of serious em-
barrassment to Governments and to people
and impossible of continuance. They repre-
sent political opportunism of the cheapest
kind, throw wide open the door to patron-
age and graft, and rest not on the secure
foundation of honest work but on debt —
are welcomed with joy by every boodler
and monopolist in the community they are
foisted upon. Has Labor wholly forgotten
that it has a plank in its platform about
land values? Is it going to scrap the best
of all instruments for causing subdivision?
Expensive schemes of resumption and traf-
ficking in p.n.’s, whether for soldiers or
others, can only be embarked upon by men
who have no faith in land taxation. But
surely the strangling of Labor policy might
be left to its confessed opponents.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The people who have cause to know
About the fate of Blogg and Co.
Are not at all prepared to say
That methods old, and cut, and dried
By long tradition will provide
Always the best and safest way
To manage things. They even might
Declare the old ways were not right.
Blogg was “a man of great ideers.”
In the beginning, it appears,
He gathered up a crowd with cash
Prepared to trade in any way
In everything from gold to clay
(The scheme made in its time a splash),
A sort of minor trust; and so
Emerged the firm of Blogg and Co.
Now Blogg, whose head was full of dreams.
Who revelled in peculiar schemes—
A very curious sort of man —
Propounded for the firm’s success
A system new: the business
Upon the British party plan
He thought might best be run. Said he,
“This is how it occurs to me!”
Well, Blogg had hopes of cornered wheat,
While Blither’s instincts turned to meat;
And Blogg with vigor fought to get
Men well informed on wheat and chaff
Elected to the office staff;
While Blither, who had quite a set
On Blogg’s pet scheme, sought men replete
With knowledge of the trade in meat.
Each canvassed all the folk he knew
Amongst shareholders, till there grew
A sort of feud between them; they
Held meetings and explained with heat
The vital claims of corn and meat.
Yet, on the staff election day,
So even did the voting run,
Blogg’s faction got most votes by one!
The office staff at once got down
To business. A .chap called Brown
Secured the managerial seat
By just one vote; he hoisted then
To all the highest billets men
Who were well up in chaff and wheat;
And, calling in the office staff,
Proposed a policy of chaff.
The Blither’s fancy man, Jake Jones,
Then rose and said, in tragic tones, _
That it to him seemed scarcely right
To plunge into a deal in chaff,
When all but half the office staff
Opposed that madness. He “would fight
This wild idea.” He was “appalled.”
“A general meeting should be called !”
The staff then argued many days.
Each side its case in many ways
Put forward ; till at last from Brown
A junior clerk (his name was Bones)
Deserted to the side of Jones.
Then, on the votes, Brown’s case went
down !
(The staff, while this was going through.
Did nothing much but draw its screw.)
Brown then the managerial chair
Gave up to Jones, who, seated there,
Picked out men well informed in meat
For’ all the top-notch billets. Jones,
Alas ! forgot the youngster Bones,
Who nursed the slight with angry heat.
His vengeful vote to Brown he shied.
Down came Jones’ castles and his pride.
The wild shareholders then uprose
To solve the problem bellicose,
And, more in anger than in hope,
They balloted again. Alack !
They got the same old gangsters back
Except young Bones, who had to slope.
But when the voting was all done,
The Blither faction scored by one!
The thing went on for months, until
The mad shareholders had their fill.
But, oh ! it was too late to save
Much from the wreck! ’Tis best that you
Praise not the party system to
Those ruined men, or to the grave
You will go swiftly. Blogg and Co.
In liquidation had to go.

HAMER.


most of our industrial legislation, and a
hundred other things were uncalled for, so
it is claiming now that the Constitution
does not require to be changed. The bleat
of every Conservative paper is that the
Federal Parliament already has full power
to organise the Commonwealth for war pur-
poses. For example, the S. M. Herald
U/9/T5) :—•
The Prime Minister added, in his reply to Mr.
Cook, that the amendments would add to the security
of the Commonwealth. Mr. Fisher should give one
single instance to show how the Commonwealth will
be strengthened if these Bills are carried.
Yet in issue after issue, during the preceding
10 days, this same journal had been showing
in its news-columns the impotence of the
Government in certain matters intimately
related to Defence. In the munition areas
of the United Kingdom the National Govern-
ment has compelled all public houses to
remain closed till 4 pan. The British
Government was able to do this out of hand,
since its authority is as great in Lanark-
shire as it is in Yorkshire or Essex. The
Australian Defence Department is equally
anxious to assail the drink problem. The
Commissioner whom it appointed to inquire
into the state of the Liverpool Camp recom-
mended that “all hotels should be closed
against recruits” ; also that no liquor should
be sold near Liverpool. But this is a matter
i.a which, under our Constitution, the Fede-
ration lias to wait upon the States. We
find therefore that in Westralia the Assembly
is debating in a leisurely manner the holding
of a referendum on the question of shorten-
ing the trading hours of the public houses;
that in South Australia a Licensing Bill,
closing all liquor bars at 6 p.m. as from
March 26, 1916, has just gone to the Legis-
lative Council; that in N. S. Wales nothing
at all is to be done —lest, as the Sydney
Telegraph (25/8/T5) put it, “the big
brewing interest which can hire motor-cars
for elections should suffer”; and so on.
The National Government can’t hurry up or
in any way coerce the State politicians in
this matter, and the State politicians are not
going to do anything in a rash and hasty
manner which may cost them votes. A few
days ago the Australian Government stopped
the export of meat from N. S. Wales. The
idea was that it was needed for consump-
tion elsewhere in Australia. The N. S.
Wales Chief Secretary’s response was a
threat of a writ and an action for damages.
Victoria has. been buying, poor and dirty
wheat from the U.S.A., in part at least
because N. S. Wales was in a position,
despite the fact that the Commonwealth is
at war, to treat the fellow-Australian next
door as an enemy subject. In a similar
spirit Victoria has been refusing to let its
wheat go to South Australia, and Queens-
land has heen hanging on to its meat. When
a private citizen is attacked, he needs to
have his arms free, if he is to avert disaster,
and the same applies to a nation. The Aus-
tralian Government is debarred under the
Constitution from protecting Australia in
numberless directions such as those above
mentioned. If the Referenda questions, are
accepted at the end of the year the position
will be relieved. But they may be turned
down. And in any event a lot of valuable
time and money must he lost. The
Bulletin’s alternative —namely, a Bill
conferring on Parliament all the requisite
powers for the duration of the war , the
measure to be at once validated in toto by
the High Court, as provided for by the Judi-
ciary Act —affords a reasonable compromise.
It would be adopted were it not that both
parties are battling, in tbe name for patri-
otism, to score a political triumph.
“Mammon, Cast Not Thy Servants Out
Lest They Perish.”
By a majority of nine votes the N.S.W.
Assembly decided last week to swallow the
Norton-Gkiffiths contract. Therefore the
shindykit can now go ahead in peace and
comfort to spend the money the State will
borrow for it, and to draw commission and
salaries and otherwise behave after the man-
ner of shin'dykits. Holman’s speech in
justification of the awful bargain was on the
lines of the familiar wail that comes from
the deadbeat called upon to explain his bul-
bous nose and devastated boots. The essence
of it all was that he had been
living from hand to mouth, borrow-
ing here and cadging there; that he
had to get money somehow; and that
unless he kept on piling up the debt many
people would be thrown out of employment.
The merits of this contract —the des-
pairing rush with the family blankets to the
pawnshop —are no longer subjects of discus-
sion, for the best of all reasons that there
are no merits. Even the half-truths, down-
right perjuries and assorted subterfuges which
served the purposes of a few months ago,
have been abandoned by their originators.
All the yarns about Norton Griffiths and
Co. and the vast capital behind them and the
terms on which the borrowing was to proceed
have gone into the ash-barrel, and the trans-
action stands naked (or almost naked) for
what it really is—the final step in the de-
moralisation of a Parliamentary party. The
last rag of principle has been thrown to the
winds. Even the disreputable old gags about
“developing the national resources,” increas-
ing the public wealth, and all the rest, of it
have been abandoned, and the confession is
made that after all these years Labor finds
itself compelled to rely for sustenance on
Cohen —that without a regular dole from
Fat the people cannot earn their daily bread!
And this in a State richly endowed with
almost everything required by man, with its
lands calling for fuller occupation, and
warehouses crammed with imported goods.
According to Holman, the unhappy feature
of the transaction is that “it means depart-
ure from the principles of day labor.” If
this were the only lump of coke in the
damper, toleration would not be impossible.
The fundamental disaster is that a pro-
longed orgy of boom and bloat, of
pandering to parasitism in its worst
form, has brought the State to a
pass at which constituted authority finds
itself compelled to import at enormous cost
a speculator to hold the
tottering superstructure up. The fooling of
Labor by the politicians having finished, they
are now fooling themselves. And this is
their trinity—Cohen, Ragtown and Shindy-
kit!
Critics and the Law.
“Garnishor” on critics, libellous and other-
wise :—-
The Sydney journalist who recovered substantial
damages against a critic of his book was in luck i
one measures the result by the cases. The critic is
given remarkable latitude by the law. That whic i
would be ruinous if published of a grocer s buttei
may safely be written of a piece of painting, or wilt-
ing, or sculpture. In these matters “every latitu e
must be given to opinion and to prejudice. Meie
exaggeration or even gross exaggeration would no
make the comment unfair. However wrong the
opinion expressed may be in point of truth, or
however prejudiced the writer, it may still be wit in
the prescribed limit.” Lord Justice Bowen said
that in such matters it must be assumed that man
is entitled to entertain any opinion he pleases, how-
ever wrong, exaggerated or violent it may be.
Here are some examples of the lengths to which
critics of various sorts of written works have been
allowed to go. It was said of a publication called
the True Briton that “it was the most vulgar,
ignorant and scurrilous journal ever published in
Great Britain.” The Times was sued for saying
this; but Lord Chief Justice Kenyon held that the
words could not be libellous. Handbills distributed
by tradesmen are open to the comment of the critic.
Of a marine-store dealer’s handbill a writer once
said that it was “pernicious in its effects, as offering
great inducements to servants to rob their masters ;
but the dealer lost the action which he brought,
despite the fact that in addition to other abusive
remarks there was a flaming headline which ran:
“Encouraging Servants to Rob their Masters.” Many
such examples might be quoted ; but these two are
sufficient to illustrate the contrast with the Sydney
libel, the salient part of which described the book
that was the subject of it as “the hastily strung-
together extracts from a copious but not very intel-
ligently constructed series of tales.”
It would be fair criticism to say of this sentence
that it is so badly constructed that most schoolboys
would be ashamed of having written it. It is nearly
meaningless. But it has probably just enough of
the right sort of meaning to contain the bacillus of
libel. The test is this. Are the words an attack
upon the personal character of the writer instead of
an attack upon the literary quality of his hook?
This plaintiff’s case was that the words branded him
as a literary thief, and it was in virtue of this con-
tention that he got his verdict. He said that if you
took away the adverbs and adjectives which bind the
words together, you were left with a statement that
his book was “extracts,” and nothing else. In such
cases it is a question for the Judge whether the
words can be libellous in law, and then for the jury
whether in fact they are so. Tfie Judge was in-
vited to nonsuit the plaintiff, but he was probably
right in saying that the words could raise the issue
of fact which the plaintiff said they raised, and of
course if they could raise such an issue the jury
alone was competent to pronounce as to whether they
did.
The interest the critic has for lawyers is that a
variation of the law on “Fair Comment” is made in
his favor. The phrase “fair comment” as applied
to the everyday sort of libel has led many an earnest
young editor into trouble. He interprets it to mean
that any comment is fair; whereas a plea of “fair
comment” is on exactly the same footing as a plea
of justification. In “justification” your defence
alleges that the words are true, and in “fair -com-
ment” it alleges the same thing, and goes on to say
that in those circumstances your comment on the
facts was fair. It is only common-sense. If the law
were otherwise a writer could set up any old pack
of lies about a public man and then start comment-
ing on the lies. None of these technicalities apply
to the critic. He really can comment just as he
pleases; and as long.as he keeps clear of an author’s
personal character and confines himself to objurga-
tions of the author’s books, then any comment is
fair.

Our Pampered Scourge.
Dr. Ralph Worrall, a Sydney specialist in
women’s diseases, gave evidence last week
before the usual old Parliamentary Select
Committee which spends diligent weeks in-
quiring into the already known. Most of
what he had to say about the appalling
effects of syphilis is now platitudinous; but
speaking as a gynaecologist he made some
comparatively fresh disclosures. He men-
tioned that about 80 per cent, of still births
and 50 per cent, of cases of sterility in
women were due to venereal disease. He said
that a large proportion of patients were
innocent married women who had been in-
fected by their husbands, and who came to
the doctor not knowing what was wrong
with them. “The disease,” he went on, “is
quite a common thing among married
women of all classes.” He considered that
it should be a criminal offence to spread
venereal disease; that the Registrar should
register no marriage unless it was accom-
panied by a certificate of health on the part
of the man ; and that the Rathburn pamphlet
and accessories should be made generally
available. llow typical of the professional
attitude towards this scourge! The doctors
are genuinely anxious to see syphilis effec-
tively tackled, though success must mean
severe inroads upon their incomes. But
there is a point beyond which''few of them
are prepared to advance. Here is one who
will make criminals of people for spreading
disease; who will deny diseased people the
right to marry; who is prepared, in short,
to convulse the whole of our social system
in order to minimise this horror, but who
fears to recommend the one course which
will wipe it right out. If the authorities had
attacked bubonic plague when it appeared
in Australia 15 years ago by prescribing
hard labor for every citizen who —perhaps
unwittingly—passed it on to someone else,
our great cities might to-day be fair imi-
tations of London in Charles Ilfs reign.
The exposure of bottles of formalin, with
instructions how to use it, and a pamphlet
on Rats, would have done little to check the
epidemic. What the doctors, with the
eager concurrence of the politicians, did was
to fall on the plague with utter ruthlessness.
No one’s feelings were considered. If a
visiting duke had developed it during break-
fast he would have lunched the same day in
a lock hospital. If the most costly house
in the Commonwealth had been shown to be
insanitary or rat-infested, alterations would
have been required of its owners on the
spot. Under this treatment the plague
languished and died. The same applies,
more or less, to most other serious infectious
and contagious diseases. Small-pox, typhus,
diphtheria-all would be Taging. b risldy now
lint for the one measure which, m regaru
S soil's, the doctors hate to —i
and which the politicians fear to take, lhat
measure is compu sory notification It s
far more merciful m the long:um. to s( igrc
e-ate a svphilitic than to render him or ner
Sable to gaol; it is obviously better to wipe
out a disease which makes a or a
tragedy, or both, of marriage, than to deal
with it through a Registrar; and to talk of
preventives and prophylactics in sudi a con-
nection is tantamount to trying to put out
a bush fire with a garden hose. .1 his
disease which, on the word of the doctors, is
devitalising the race, will not get easier to
attack as the years pass. What just tic
tion have the State Governments foi' not
attacking it, in a serious spmt, now .
How It Is Done in Japan.
From “Morimoto,” an old dweller in “the
East” : ,
I am writing this with a fountain pen made m
Japan, bought there for 18 sen—4 s d. And it is a
perfectly efficient little pen, with an imitation gold
nib and rubber-and-glass syringe for cnarging, put
„p in a neat cardboard box. I have been using
it side by side with an English pen costing over
15 times more, and line for line it behaves as well
as the expensive article. A fountain pen foi 4jd. .
This is not the only article Japan is making nearly
as good as its European counterpart, and at a
fraction of the cost. In a country village I bougot
pocket-books in imitation morocco for 24 d. and
lead-pencils for a farthing; and once when it
rained I secured for 7*d. an umbrella which not
only kept off the rain but carried an invitation
to "the gods to abstain from hurling thunderbolts
at me. Then, at an art shop in Kyoto, I bought
for 2Jd. color prints by Hydeyoshine which are a
priceless possession and a joy for ever. The beauty
of a bottle made from a single piece of wood, with
a strip of bark left on the outside, captivated me.
It cost 3id. I bought for 6fd. a pencil-case ex-
quisitely inlaid. It was impossible not to buy when,
the simplest articles were, by the simplest of means,
made beautiful —when nothing was so small as to be
unworthy of the artistic touch.
But one could not help thinking that behind all
this clieap-and-good production there must be
black forests of factory chimneys, peopled by narrow-
chested children and mothers with child bending
over machinery and coughing and spitting amongst
the dust of manufacture. And so it is. A new
industrial era is only just dawning in China. In
Japan it is at high noon. But in her leap at civili-
sation Japan has got no further than the Victorian
era. She has innumerable factories, but no effec-
tive factory legislation. Half a million females are
employed in factories and mills in Japan, and
300,000 of them are under the age of 20 years. In
most of the mills the employees are lodged within
the mill-compound, which they are not allowed to
leave except on special occasions. Here they work
for 14 to 16 hours per day; here they spend what
little time is left for recreation, sleep and meals.
The beds are never aired, for each has to accommo-
date four persons, two on the day shift and two on
the night shift. Tuberculosis is rampant. Children
under 15 years work from 66 to 78 hours per week.
If Sunday should be treated as a holiday at the
factory the employer is permitted to extract two
hours more work per night to make up for the lost
day. Two hundred thousand girls are annually
“recruited,” and it is reckoned that only 80,000 of
them return to their homes after their period of
labor is completed. Of the other 120,000 most
drift into other factories; many into prostitution.
Japanese employers are obsessed with the idea,
exploded in most Western countries, that the
longer the hours of labor the greater must be the
output. School children persist at their lessons for
SO hours a week, as if their country’s life depended
on it. Officials hang about their desks for nine
hours a day and get through work that could
equally well be done in five. These are all phases
of the exhausting effort Japan is making, on her
poor soil, with all her self-sacrificing patriotism, to
catch up to Western civilisation, which had a
thousand years’ start.
. Conscripting the Volunteer.
“Whitehall” introduces a friend: —
It is the correct thing to spurn' -the female who
distributes white feathers to those young men whom
she has reason to believe are''afraid to 1 go to the war.
But why? The white -feather, in one or other of
its is an inevitable corollary of
the voluntary-service system. Voluntary service, in
time of national peril, amounts to conscription of the
self-respecting. The of our young men are
already fighting. The self-respecting ones that are
not fighting have some good reason —a family, ill-
health, poor physique—for being where they are. In
any event they, like the best of ottr elderly men
and our women of all ages, are helping with money,
with personal service, and in other ways. The type
that, in about 90 per cent, of cases, does nothing
whatever for his country is the young waster who,
though fit to serve, has no more desire or intention
to do so than he has to poison himself.
A case in point is my more or less youthful
acquaintance Algernon Brigges. He lives on an
allowance from his people. He is a fair golfer and
an average tennis player. From time to time he
gets drunk. When the war started he said that
those who had volunteered—the men who are now
in Gallipoli —were posing humbugs who knew that
they would never smell powder. For about 10
months thereafter he said that he would gladly go
only he knew the trouble would be over before he
could get there. Latterly he has come round to the
view that every man is wanted. But he won’t
enlist in Australia. His idea is, at some time in
the dim and unspecified future, to “go to England
and fight with his equals.”
This young man —and there are thousands of him -
is being handed white feathers every day. He finds
them in the paper at breakfast. His girl friends
present them to him in all innocence by means of
remarks such as: “Were you the Mr. Brigges who
enlisted last week?” “Father said that you had only
joined a rifle club, but I told him it was the A.I.F.
I was right, wasn’t I?” And so forth. The recruit-
ing politicians shower them on him as he hurries
past their platform. Nice old ladies give them to
him with kindly diffidence, and irritable old gentle-
men dash them rudely in his face.
What does it matter that they have not .been
plucked from the fowl? The principle which is at
the root of the voluntary-service system—namely,
that those who won’t fight of their own accord must
be shamed into fighting—is the same. There are young
men whom a thoughtless glance or intonation of the
voice will send in wild haste to the. nearest recruit-
ing dep6t. There are thousands who have needed
no push at all. There are others who will go readily
as soon as the fact that they are really needed is
put to them in an effective way. But there are
many—the Brigges type—who require the 4.7 gun of
argument which is contained in the universal symbol
of cowardice personally aimed by one who is in a
position to hit the mark. What if the weapon does
occasionally wound the wrong man ? The injury
cannot hurt him much in the nature of things.
What no one can question is the effectiveness of its
work in the right quarter. And so long as we are
satisfied to recruit our armies by defying our men
to face the ignominy of staying at home, no enlist-
ment weapon which does what is asked of it should
be barred.
4.
When Australia last week received the
body of General Bridges' it got the biggest
lesson it is ever likely to receive on the value
of straight rifle-shooting. Bridges was
some Turk’s carefully-selected -victim; and
when the fine soldier fell the brain of the
Australian division temporarily ceased to
work. It is hard to understand how any
intelligent soldier can bring himself to
under-rate the importance of straight shoot-
ing with the small arm; yet there is—or
was until recently—a section which argued
more or less vaguely against it. As if
mediocrity could ever be anything but a
disadvantage! The danger of that theory
was that it provided a liandy excuse for
sending partially-trained riflemen to com- •
pete with the sharpshooting Turks —those
enthusiastic collectors of Australian identi-
fication discs. However, after a few months’
hard fighting, the school of theorists who do
not place, much value on straight individual
shooting but put their trust in “the volume
of fire,” must have thinned out considerably.
Now another fashion has arisen. Possibly
because One general has expressed the
opinion that two men with a machine-gun
could hold up a division armed with rifles,
some phrase-maker has dubbed the rifle “the
infantryman’s toy.” It is a silly gibe at
best, and the lesson stands good. The Turk
who did such valuable service to his side by
dropping the Australian commander could
not have lugged a machine-gun with him any
more than the Frenchman who shot
Nelson could have dragged a cannon up the
rigging of his ship. Because they each pos-
sessed the necessary skill their “toys” proved
deadly to the men they were turned against;
and the victims were singled out (as
only the marksmen can single men out)
because they were leaders whose loss might
conceivably mean everything.

The distribution of funds such as have been
raised in Australia during the last year
always gives rise to controversy. The ex-
perience is that in most cases the adminis-
tration is narrow and penurious, and the
fund frequently outlives the purpose for
which it was raised. Generally speaking,
it is best to distribute the money quickly;
and this idea is at the back of much that is
being chorused now about various patri-
otic and Red Cross collections. The
Bulletin has already said that these funds
are to spend and not to - hoard, and that
present necessities should not be turned
down simply because there may be future
necessities. Yet liberality must for the pre-
sent be tempered by prudence. In the case
of an ordinary disaster the worst is usually
known at once. But in relation to the war
and the war funds the problems of to-day
are not to be taken as the measure of those
that • will be on- hand a year or two years
hence. Therefore.in cutting up the joint
it is well to at least recollect that the job
will he done best when the carver sees how
many plates are to be passed along. And
though no one can yet tell what that num-
ber will be, most people know that the
capacity of Australians to respond volun-
tarily or by compulsion to future demands
is being materially altered.

If any member of the Federal Parliament
feels that he may do so without offending
the Party Joss, he could do good service to
Australia by securing some up-to-date in-
formation from the Defence Minister about
the age groups of men (1) serving in the
army, (2) wounded, killed or sick. The
purpose of this information would be to see
how the lads_of 18 and 20, whom Australia
has been sending away, have been getting
on. Colonel Mackesy, a Maoriland officer,
states that experience of the campaign has
shown that the enlistment of youngsters
should be discouraged, if only on military
grounds, and that effort should be directed
towards sending forward a more mature
article.. The boys, says Mackesy, crack up
too soon under fatigue, and lack judgment
and restraint where those qualities mean
everything. He merely says what might
have been expected. A lad of this age is-,
not likely to be as cautious as a. man. a
little older; and not only about his skin,,
but in regard to health and so forth. His
considerable ignorance seems likely to be-
come a danger; his enthusiasm to rujf on to
recklessness. It would therefore be good to.
know how the adolescent Australian is actu-
ally faring, more especially as a considerable
number of his elder brothers are sheltering
behind the kid’s knapsack, and might like to
mobilise themselves if they heard that the
youngster was getting hurt more plentifully
than was good for him.
Red Sunday.
(APRIL 25, 1915.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fame watched Australia as she dreamless
Remote**in the unstoried South. He cried :
“Where shall her soul be born?” and
searched the wide
Spaces of earth. “What place but Troy,
where wept—
And still weeps—Helen, or the strait that
kept .
From Persian hordes all Europe and denied
Xerxes —the Hellespont that in his stride
To conquer India Alexander leapt?”
So on that calm, momentous April morn,
That sacred soil where Agamemnon stood,
By this new race, united and made whole,
Was made more sacred with Australian
blood.
Blind Homer thrilled, remembering, while
that soul
In pride and hitter agony was born.

The Long, Long Fight.
Tiie gibe of the First Lord of the Admi-
ralty that the German’s pledge to Uncle Sam
in regard to submarine warfare rested on
recognition rather than on repent-
ance of murder, would have been more to
the _ point if the launching of torpedoes
against passenger ships had been stopped.
But as the baby-murdering campaign has
been re-opened against a vessel with 900
people aboard, it looks as if the Hun is still
seeing red. Either that or he has not been
able to yet give all liis cut-throats amended
'riding instructions. The difficulty of reach-
ing them is, of course, considerable, so old
v on Tirpitz may get into even more serious
trouble with Hollweg and the Kaiser and
such diplomats as the Huns possess. There
is good reason, however, to believe that there
is more than meets the eye in Balfour’s
veiled statement about the campaign under
the water, and that the Hoggenzollern has
found that frightfulness can overleap itself.
lor a month or so the submarine attack
was successful in a brutal, savage sort of
way ; but after getting its second wind the
British navy has beer taking from the Hun
a terrible toll. In fact,' the only certain
thing about the war is that on sea Britain
holds the. enemy in a suffocating grasp. If
the position by land was anything like so
good as it is by water, peace would be close
at hand. But Constantinople is still far off
and the Rhine looks no closer. Almost daily
the weary old yarn about the Turk being
in a panic bobs uo from somewhere; but as
ho was. reported to be in the same frame of
mind six months ago and has been fighting
like a demented cat ever since, these vague
assurances- seem entitled to disrespect. The
truth appears to be that unless more men
and spades and crowbars and Ivddite are
available against him, the Mussulman will
continue to be in a panic and hold his
ground. Elsewhere the unpleasantness is
more or less a rumor, though the Bear is
making the German fight hard for every mile
of .wilderness he achieves, and every day the
rains and the bog come nearer. When in the
winter William sits down to hold on to
what he has got, he may find it not unlike
the tail of a tiger. At that stage Round 1
will have ended.
One of the tragic events of last week
was Willy Kelly’s appearance on a patriotic
platform with the proposition that all pre-
sent should pledge themselves not to buy
German goods for five years. And there are
those who complain that we are not fierce
enough in our proposals for punishing Ger-
many!
At the Front Door.
“McNortii,” after a look at the front door:
Ihe people who scoff at (lie idea of attempting to
settle the North with whites are fond of creating the
impression that Port Darwin—which they hold up as
a sample of the whole Territory—is a dilapidated
collection of hovels eaten by white ants and situ-
ated beneath a blistering sun on low-lying, sandy,
flat country, where nothing but miserable, stunted ti-
trees grow. They hint that a general air of depres-
sion fills the gaps between drinks, and say dreadful
things about the enervating effect of the climate on
Europeans. These advocates of a Discolored Aus-
tralia also assert that any attempt to rear children
in such a place is murder. In short, the Territory
(that jjs to say, Darwin) is only a fit habitat for
Chinamen and niggers and super-whites. Now for
some facts. Darwin is situated on a level plateau
i Oft. above the sea, and overlooking it. The town
is laid out in squares. Its wide streets are lined
with banyans and other shade trees. With the ex-
ception of the street known as “Chinatown”—a blot
on an otherwise beautiful place—neat, substantial
bungalows with bamboo-screened verandahs, a;nd
stone-built stores, hotels and Government offices are
the general rule. Green foliage is a feature. I
visited Darwin recently, and will always remember
watching from the deck, as the steamer entered the
harbor, the green and fresh appearance of the in-
digenous flora growing out of the abruptly-sloping
walls of the plateau, with here and there a white-
painted house nestling amongst the trees. This, too,
in the Territory’s “dry” season, when most of that
part of Australia which lies “down South” was
stiuggling in the throes of drought. Darwin’s numer-
ous healthy, sturdy-limbed youngsters—nearly all
local products, some of the third generation—dis-
prove the statement that white women and children
cannot survive the climate. Darwin being on the
coast has a hotter and more humid climate than the
inland country, and for that reason it—and therefore
the rest of the country—is held up by Black Aus-
tralians as being a kind of death-trap for those
Europeans who make a living by anything more
strenuous than banging a typewriter or wielding a
pen. Yet the fact that there are, many hundreds of
white men doing hard manual labor in Darwin hasn’t
created a demand for another hospital or an exten-
sion of the cemetery. These men are just ordinary,
everyday individuals such as may be seen working
in Melbourne or Sydney. By spending £200,000 in
a meat-works at Darwin, Vestey Bros, are giving
evidence of their belief in the ability of white men
to do things in the Territory; and they didn’t reach
that belief without strict inquiry on the spot. And,
as already stated, Darwin hasn’t the best section of
the Territory’s climate. Inland, almost any climatic
condition and degree of temperature can be found.

Sydney, on Saturday night. The best work
is done by Australians. Dorothy Brunton
plays Sylvia with the utmost charm and
humor, and Marie Eaton gets some fine
chances to use her large and tuneful voice
and display her considerable acting abilities
as Marion Thorne. Field Fisher is divert-
ing as Dr. Thorne; so are W. H. Rawlins,
as a Yankee lumber king, and Alfred Frith,
who gives a taking representation of a
drunk. Florence Vie is uproarious, and
Gwen Hughes demurely lovely, which is all
they are asked to be. But whoever cast Paul
Plunket as a comic Frenchman when C. H.
Workman was available for the part deserves
to be fined half a crown at least, and who-
ever made C. H. Workman a jeune premier
with Paul Plunket on the premises merits a
violent death. Workman is a fine character
actor, and his ■ Frenchman in “The Girl in
the Taxi” was particularly good. Plunket
can play nothing but Plunket. Workman is
elderly and unbeautiful; Plunket was built
by nature to figure in the nmtine'e-haunting
flipper’s dreams. Another piece of foolish
casting is the squandering of Cecil Bradley
on the super-role of hotel page. The show is
nicely produced, on the whole, though the
lady who sews the garments of the chorus
gentlemen : could do with a chiding. They
are uniformly dreadful.

Patriotism and gore are the watchwords
at Sydney Adelphi, where “Our Boys of the
Dardanelles” was staged on Saturday night.
The hero is dismissed from the service with
ignominy for being drunk and disorderly in
the presence of the enemy. As a matter
of fact he has been dosed with Cairo wine,
which is notoriously capable of doing any-
thing to a man. Dejected he trails back to
the family homestead, but is met by Jack
Cosgrove (John is nowadays a colonel)
and spurned. Merely delaying long enough
to swear off alcohol for life, he en-
lists under another name. How he rises to
fame upon the ashes of his dead drunk;
how the Colonel, his father, meets him
again ; how a reconcilement occurs and love
enters into his apparently blasted life —
these are the incidents which W. Hunt,
Ethel Buckley, Frank Crossley and others
depict. The part of Captain Petland, the
German spy, is well played by Frederick
Neilson.

“Mum’s the Word” came td Sydney Royal
on Saturday night to spend a week. This
successor to “Stop Your Nonsense” is a
musical version of that brisk and clever
three-act comedy, “The Chaperon,” produced
first by Beaumont Smith at the Palace some
time last year. The experiment of introduc-
ing songs and danbes isn’t very successful,
simply because there isn’t the room for them,
and, with one or two exceptions, they hold
up the procession just when the audience is
eager to know what is going to happen next.
Still, the complications of the plot aren’t
numerous enough to make the onlooker’s
head buzz, and the end comes with a slam
in the right place, just when the interest has
run out.
Frank Bradley gives another tine exhibi-
tion of doddering. Tom Shelford rattles
along cheerfully as a self-possessed young
man of leisure. Sinna St. Clair presents
a clever study of the aggressive type of
brain-bursting female. Ethel Dane is once
more the disturbing butterfly. And Edmund
Sherras deserves a; round of applause for a
sympathetic rendering of “Somerset,” a
pleasant English ballad. “The Barrier,”
played by a different co., is due on Saturday.

Ivajiyaina is still giving his “caligraphic

should haste to the Tivoli box office. The

AZURKIM (Harry Beaumont) to Villain Pet-
land (Fred Neilson): “Traitor, our skins
may be dark, but not as black as thy
false heart.” (Loud whistling.)
In the rush of ; musical-play revivals at
Melbourne Majesty’s an extra week is
allotted to “Our Miss Gibbs,” and the recep-
tion which that fortunate stores-assistant
got from a crowded house last Saturday
seemed to justify the J.C.W. management in
billing her for 12 nights. The revival
doesn’t quite explain why Mary Gibbs from
Yorkshire broke the record in Sydney four
or five years ago-, but it is at least a brighter
show than many another of its sort. The
story hangs together, and is attached to a
notable joke. Hughie, the amateur crook,
who engages a professional to coach him in
burglary and petty larceny, has lost none of
his humor since his satirical meaning faded
away. Raffles is dead, but the absurdity of
the Hon. Hughie remains a live subject, and
his “pinching” of the Ascot Gold Cup is still
a sparkling source of complications. A pur-
pose had to be found for dragging Mary’s
low-comedy cousin Timothy into the pro-
ceedings. Something was necessary to keep
Timothy from degenerating into a conven-
tional nuisance, so he was made to fall a
victim to the wrong kitbag, containing the
Gold Cup and a crowbar, instead of two
dozen long-laid eggs and a property cake
with blobs of ink at the bottom of it. Such
ingenuity of plot is rare in musical comedy.
Judged by ordinary rules of etiquette “Miss
Gibbs” is a masterpiece of construction.

Thelma Raye has qualifications for the
name part, though a fairy footstep is not
one of them. Ethel Cadman is a dainty
Rady Elizabeth and a sweet singer in the
one number which gives her voice a chance.
But she has no punch to speak of. All the
ladies are weak in the same respect save
Ethel Morrison, who is unduly vigorous for
an impecunious woman of fashion. Addie
Lennard plays the Franco-Caledonian dress-
maker rather too quietly ; Maggie Moore, in
the disguise of a duchess, is a redundant
example of suppressed feelings; and six
attractive bridesmaids suggest a cluster of
daffodils rather than a bunch of rosebuds.
For the most part the comedy is Leslie Hol-

second-hand furniture, and kept them for
luck. The rest of the entertainment is legs,
hats, costumes, parasols and animated
scenery, the musical accompaniment being
conducted by Victor Champion.

At Melbourne Royal the plump, emphatic
grafter and the tall, calm sleuth are still
baiting their respective traps with a neck-
lace of Paris pearls. “Under Cover” is
only in its second week at present, so the
bloom has not yet been rubbed off its dram-
atic surprises. One of these surprises
amounts to spoof. When the audience dis-
covers a sleeping apartment adjoining Mil -
ward’s airy sitting-room it naturally looks
for something to happen; and when he sheds
his coat a thrill of expectation runs through
the multitude. But lie merely puts himself
into a smoking jacket, and a burst of aston-
ishment follows.

Melbourne Princess’s, after a three weeks’
lapse into panto, is about to pick up the
broken thread of melodrama and resume
business as usual. “Bribes in the Wood”
counts the Kaiser out for the last time on
Friday, and on Saturday a Marlow co.,
partly new to Melbourne, will deal with
“Mary Latimer —Nun.”

The polite art of home-wrecking is revived
with enthusiasm in “Not Understood,” the
latest attraction at Melbourne King’s. Two
old offenders, known as Griffith Wolfe and
Agnes Trevor, burst up the happy home, of
Paul Fetherstone and his" missus by playing
on the couple’s mutual readiness to believe
the worst of one another. Grif and Agnes
add cayenne to a warm situation by posing
as the successful co-res. in each case, and
later on endeavor to improve their positions
by paying furious addresses to the sundered
couple. But Paul, suddenly blind from
grief, maintains an implacable virtue in
Aggie’s torrid society. Likewise Mrs. Paul
develops a refrigerating rectitude that turns
the ardent but sheepish Griffith into some-
thing resembling frozen mutton. This senti-
mental stalemate continues to the inevitable
reunion in the last act. Two other couples
meantime endeavor to lighten the tedium by
publishing allegedly funny versions of their
own love encounters. Bert Bailey is the
outstanding figure in these proceedings., got
up as a doddering-{philosopher armed with a
clarionet. Miss Bevan’s mannishness is loud
and unrestrained in the part of the maiden
aunt who listens to the doleful strains of
Bailey’s instrument and later . succumbs
to a base canard concerning his wealth.
Arthur Bertram and Miss Roberts presume
to be a filbert and a flapper in a state of
love; but as their “business” has already
been done to death, they may only be said
to be turning over the remains. Guy Has-
tings as the artist Fetherstone loses his
wife and his sight in a manner befitting the
double misfortune; but Miss Adrienne as
Mrs. Fetherstone has small emotional equip-
ment for her job. Careful auditing of the
parts of R. Bellairs (Griffith Wolfe) and
Miss Adeson (Agnes Trevor), also reveals
various deficits. It only remains to mention
Fred Macdonald, who as a superfluous French
Count often reaches a state of frenzy most
dangerous in these explosive times.

The fourth Orchestral Concert of the..
Taits’ series comes due at the Melbourne
Auditorium on Saturday afternoon, with the
Beethoven Symphony in C minor for chief
item, and Laver in front of the band. Two
more appearances of the Brussels Concert
Party are announced, and Saturday night
will see the last of them at the Audi.
Of the new turns at the Melbourne Tivoli
it may be said that everything in the bill is
lively. . Crouch and Welch —the lady being
patriotically economical in her use of
underwear—are fairly good as frivollers and
quite better as acrobatic dancers. May
Erne and He are a musical pair whose man-
ner of work is as odd as their results are
satisfactory, and Walter Weems blackens his
face before coming on to crack wheezes that
seem worth while, as a rule. Other features
of the programme are Ella Caspers, Gold-
spink, Annie Kent, Ida Barr and Stafford
and Co. The Bulletin, when passing com-
plimentary remarks on Stafford last week,
spoke of his trusty dogs as pointers. It
should have called them setters. The dog
responsible for the paragraph gets no bones
with his biscuit for a’week.

“The Midnight Club” is still the noisiest
end of Melbourne Bijou programme, with
Victor Prince and others shouting in concord
or otherwise. Elsewhere the Indian snake-
charmer is in evidence, along with the melo-
dious sundowner and the quick-change lady
billed as Madam Marion. Madam is the
most imposing of the lot, but she has the-
objectionable habit of talking freely in
Amurka’s disagreeable substitute for the
English language.
Last week Hoyt’s (Melbourne) revived in-
terest in John Strange Winter’s “Booties’
Baby,” by screening a free and easy adapta-
tion of that long story. Hoyt’s other big
feature was “Beatris,” a Nordisk study < of
artistic life that hurries to a very pleasing
conclusion. This week Hoyt’s programme is
eloquent of “Mother,” wherein the virtues of
that noble institution are liberally contrasted
with the failings of the Other Sort of Person.

Jack Cannot is right in his element as
director of the Follies at the Adelaide
Tivoli. He and Isabelle Darmond do some
clever work together, but their burlesque of
“Bought and Paid For” seems to puzzle
Adelaide audiences, who don’t know the play.
Alfredo fiddles, Frank Greene sings, and the
Rego and Stopit team put in some incidental
foolery which is more attractive than their
old open-mouth specialty. It is a bright
show all round. Meanwhile, Brandon Cremer
lias had a merry week at the Royal with
“Charley’s Aunt,” which is old enough to
be new to many. “In the Soup” is to fol-
low, and after that melodrama again, the
tentative Adelaide season having “caught on”
unexpectedly well. At the King’s Daisy
Jerome and Miss Gassman (with piccanin-
nies) have been dropped into the bill, the
brightest remaining feature of which is the
bulky Stevens, who balances precariously on
tottering supports. The Orange Dandies —
Pace, Naomi McQuoin. Roland Henry and
co.—are at the Town Hall, and a Conserva-
torium concert brought a big success for Jack
Fisher, baritone, who is to be given a chance
in Europe.
* * * *
From an Adelaide critic: —
To Wadham’s one-man show in the Society of
Arts rooms succeeds Will Ashton’s. Will is the son
of James, sound painter of seascapes and successful
teacher. Ashton junior learned what his father could
teach, and has since been in Europe picking up
other points. He now limits his range, and his
work is so characteristic as mostly to need no signa-
ture. Figures he avoids, except as accessories; in
these 130 pictures, there is no figure over two inches
in size. Yet there are hardly any landscapes, in
the, ordinary sense. Water Will Ashton must have,
or buildings. If he can get both together he is
happy. .Venice suits him, or Holland, and in
bridges or barges or laundry-boats in the heart of
Paris he is at his best. His other effective line
is the seascape, with special dead-white foam.
Premier Crawford Vaughan opened the exhibition of
bright, effective, and mostly u moderate-priced work.
The catalogue mentions modestly that Mr. Ashton
has been hung in the Academy and both Salons, and
has taken a Wynne prize in Sydney.
Though Home-Affairs Archibald was able
to state last week that he was satisfied all
was well regarding the construction of the
Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, certain cir-
cumstances have been referred to a commit-
tee of the Labor Caucus for investigation.
The charges advanced may be entirely reck-
less, and Archibald may be on firm ground;
nevertheless the committee will act wisely if
it takes nothing for granted. There is a dis-
tinct smell coming from this railway, and if
The Bulletin had it on the premises the
inspector of nuisances would call round to
make sure there was no corpse in the key-
hole. There is nothing like taking an un-
biassed nose to matters of this kind.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Steele Rudd’s” new play, “Duncan
McClure,” has had a successful try-out of
three nights at Toowoomba.
The N. S. Wales Income Tax Commission-
ers tapped Muriel Starr for £54 on the day
her Sydney season closed. But they had been
very long-suffering about it. On and off she
had been earning income in N. S. Wales for
years, and apparently this was the first
time they had asked for their little bite.
“II.O.” : “Under Cover” furnishes another
and particularly bad example of the Yankee
trick of “spoofing” an audienee. “O. Henry”
taught his countrymen that a snappy, unex-
pected climax will often save an inferior
short story. But it will not do the same for
a three- or four-act drama. To allow one-
self deliberately to be misled through a few
pages of print is very different to having
one’s leg pulled, for three hours in a theatre,
the real facts of the story being disclosed
only in the last three minutes. To attempt
to keep a “secret” throughout a play is rot-
ten craftsmanship, as after the first night, it
will be known in advance to an increasing
percentage of each succeeding audience. To
anybody forewarned or the ending of “Under
Cover” the scenes leading up to it must
seem utterly futile; while the playgoer to
whom the “spoof” comes as a surprise
feels that any interest he may have taken in
the previous proceedings was aroused by
false pretences. The chief effect of the care-
fully-concealed climax in this instance is to
reveal the Sherlock Holmes hero, whom the
unsophisticated audience has been admiring,
as a bright and shining ass.
“UNDER COVER,” AT MELBOURNE
ROYAL.
How an American

Or this way.
Ned Duggan’s warlike feelings found vent
in Melbourne Paunch last week. Ned’s
openiug verses were too weak to stand
alone ; for instance :
A wanton raid on commerce and trade
Is a plague on our social lives,
It absorbs our gain, and brings endless pain
To our mothers, sisters and wives.
But he got stronger as he grew more belli-
cose, and his exhortations culminated in: —
Strike till the beast is dead.
Ned very wisely stopped at that. No use
striking a corpse.
Maud Grantham has arranged a music,
song and story entertainment by way of
helping the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund. The
affair is to come off at the Assembly Hall,
Oollins-street, Melbourne, next Tuesday
night (14th). Maud Grantham will give the
dramatic Dickens tale of “Richard Double-
dick,” a couple of children stories, and “The
Making of a Red Cross Flag.” Her pre-
vious platform appearances as a one-woman
show were always interesting, and she is
now said to have improved her punch.
Four good vocalists will help.
“Te Babarantiko”: Though “The Sea
Wolf” is probably the best sea-yarn ever
filmed, one who has lived the life, cannot
help wishing that a little more realism had
been woven in. This lack is mainly owing
to the apparent impossibility of filming the
story in even a breeze of wind. There is too
much evidence of the hulk being towed
slowly (if moved at all) through calm water
—so slowly that even a distinct wake is
absent. The decks are too level for a small
craft under canvas, even in a light wind.
The cabin lamp is swung with pendulum
regularity. The lamp should swing more
perceptibly to leeward. Under no conceiv-
able circumstances could the boat capsize in
the weather pictured, unless deliberately
upset by the men in her. It is. probably
because of this difficulty of filming under
the proper weather conditions that some of
the most stirring incidents in the story are
omitted. In the “Remantling” scene ' Jack
London, who certainly knows, might have
introduced something less purposeless than
a pair of short sheerlegs to lift the jaws of
the gaff to nowhere. Yet these little flaws
are gladly forgiven for the sake of other
things that make the pulses beat with
longing for the times of not-so-very-long-ago.

Another clever Australian at present hit-
ting Noo Yark in the right spot is Daphne
Pollard. She is small and dainty, and the
Yanks are parting with much cash to see
her in “The Passing Show of 1915.” Daphne
was born in Melbourne and got her early
stage training with Tom of the old-time
Lilliputians.
“Harrison O.” : The first infant to appear
ia Mr. and Mrs. Davidson’s cradle of
national Australian drama at Oakleigh
(Vic.) was “The Fight,” by “George
Byfield.” Assuming that “George” wears
petticoats, I urge her to devote her energies
to knitting socks for soldiers, for the time
being at least. “The Fight” is a loose,
amorphous happening which claims to “deal”
with “the question of the segregation of
the unfit.” It is presumably intended to
point a moral and adorn a tale, but it does
neither. There is a consumptive young
man who wants to marry and is bombarded
with platitudes by a stodgy medico ; but in
the first act the consumptive’s inamorata
loses her sight through an explosion, and
for the remaining three acts the maiden’s
friends fill in time expressing sympathy and
bringing' the poor girl cream puffs. Between
whiles the doctor allows the platitude to
proclaim the bore, and in the last act he
partially restores the heroine’s sight, pre-
vents her committing suicide, and induces
her (the consumptive having been thrown
over for reasons quite apart from his “unfit-
ness”) to join him (whether or not in a
matrimonial manner of speaking is not quite
clear) in pushing his pet theory. The play
was a tiresome affair which arrived nowhere
by a circuitous route, afid demonstrated
nothing except that Missy Mrs. or Mr.
“Byfield’s” notions of craftsmanship do not
rise above the soliloquy and even the aside.
Unless a competent critical Board _of
Chuckers Out is appointed in connection
with the theatre, it will be in danger of
becoming merely a waste-paper basket for
MSS. judiciously declined by the Repertory
people.

The ballot for the selection of a Labor
candidate for the Willoughby (N.S.W.)
seat, vice Larkin, killed at Gallipoli, brought
John L. Chambers out on top, instead of
Hardinge, who was supposed to have the
best chance. Both were tramway men, and
prominent members of the Tramway Union,
Chambers is the son of an old Inky Way-
farer who owned the Cobargo Chronicle,
He is 34 years old, and has been in the
Tramway service for a third of his days.
The question of whether the last despair-
ing squeal of the N.S.W. pig shall be allowed
to rend the air of a neighboring State is the
latest constitutional problem confronting
the Australian Commonwealth. Happily
Isaacs is on the High C9urt bench, and the
issue can be awaited with calm confidence
that the law of the Federation will be
weighed with deliberate care and mercy will
season justice. The lawyers will supply the
apple sauce.
Scaddan’s incursions into commerce arc
disastrous nine times out of ten. The im-
portation of bran, maize and pollard from
Argentina has just resulted in the usual
deficit. Fearful that the weevil-infested
fodder would mistake itself for the Gadarene
swine and rush into the sea, the State
Industries Board offered several thousand
tons by auction the other day, and even the
local piggeries sniffed at it. About 300 tons
were languidly bid for at £3 12s. 6d. per
ton, or about £5 a ton less than it cost to
land, and efforts are now being made to
push off the balance.
Constituted authority, which made a shock-
ing mess of the drafting of the War Census
inquiries, made almost as bad a one in the
distribution of the cards. At Melbourne it
was announced that cards would l>e avail-
able on Friday, and Red Tape reminded the
public that unless it flocked to give particu-
lars of its cash and its ox and its ass the fine
would be a heavy one. But when the public
did flock, Red Tape found that the cards had
been lost, and proceedings had to be ad-
journed until they were discovered three days
later. At Sydney the cards were served out
at the G.P.O. in a small room with only one
door to panting, sweating crowds by a
youth stationed at a corner of the counter
over which inquiries about dead letters are
usually made. Later on the Courts will, no
doubt, deal with those who retired from the
scrimmage in disgust.
Frederic Albert Coghlan has been con-
firmed in the job of Auditor-General of N.
S. Wales after being Deputy for some time.
He is a Sydney native, born 1859, and lias
climbed the civil-service ladder step by step.
He was Under-Secretary in the Chief Sec-
retary’s Department from 1910 till lie was
perched on his present post. The Auditor-
Generalship is one of the oldest offices in
the service. It was first filled by William
Lithgow, who came to Australia in 1813 as
tutor in the family of David Allan, the then
Commissary-General. On June 14, 1825,
the Secretary of State appointed him Audi-
tor of General Accounts. The duties were
not heavy, so he also acted as private secre-
tary to Governor Darling. He hung on to
the Auditorship till 1852, when lie retired,
wealthy through pastoral speculations. His
successors have been Francis L. S. Mere-
wether, William Colburn Mayne, Christo-
pher Rolleston, Edward Alexander Rennie
(1883-1902), and John Vernon.
The Federal Government’s “war cards” are
now available; and there are thousands of
people who will not be able to fill in the
forms and give a true account of their
incomes. Every wealth-owner, male and
female, has to tell what his income is from
various specified sources. Then he has to
set out his outgoings under various headings,
and, deducting these from the total income,
the result is alleged by the card to be his net
income. But in thousands of cases it is
nothing of the sort. Suppose, for example, a
man draws a salary and has an income from
dividends and also runs a sheep station or
farm. And suppose, instead of making a
profit from the station or farm, he made a
loss from it, how is he going to show his, net
income except by deducting the loss? Yet
the card makes no provision for such a case :
it assumes that a man must make a profit
from every source. Half the farmers in
the country made a loss last year; and if
they merely answer the questions that have
been put to them, the result will be an en-
tirely incorrect statement, and the census,
so far as income is concerned, will be
quite valueless.
A hole in the law through which it is quite
possible that a few miners may fall to
destruction has been discovered in New-
castle (N.S.W.). Recently a mine-manager
was fined under Section 11 of the Goal
Mines Regulation Act for employing a man
who did not hold a certificate of competency
to take charge of an electric motor by which
men were raised up an inclined plane. Judge
Fitzhardinge decided, upon appeal, that it
was not necessary for a man in charge of
an engine, if he was competent, to hold a
certificate. Yet if a man does not qualify
by the ordinary methods, who is to say he is
competent? Even a man with so compara-
tively unimportant a job as a Judge must
not only be a lawyer—he must be a certi-
ficated and registered lawyer, the registra-
tion being the only proof of competency
which is taken any notice of when one is
charged with (say) accepting a fee for
doing some Real Property transfer business.
If Judge Fitzhardinge is right, and the law
doesn’t provide equal protection to the
miner, then the law should be altered
quickly.
ALONE AT LAST!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The hero strode from out the wings,
The lover of the play;
And he was free at last from kings
And lords who loved to slay.
A dozen scenes he had been through,
The heroine to win,
And many things he had to do
To do his rivals in.
But now, upon a garden seat,
Beside a painted tree,
The heroine sat down to meet,
The hero who was free.
Through fourteen scenes they’d tried in vain
To talk of love, and kiss.
But filthy villains came again,
And marred their perfect bliss.
At last the final curtain fell
Aud left them free to woo.
Instead, he muttered fiercely: “II — 1!
I’m fairly side of you!”

THE ONLY WAY TO STOP FOOD
FERMENTATION.
NEUTRALISE ACIDITY BY TAKING
A LITTLE MAGNESIA.
It’s the gas generated by fermenting food
that distends your stomach and causes you
to have a flushed face after eating, with
headaches, heartburn, flatulence, etc., and
the reason why drugs, patent medicines and
artificial digestants do not give you relief is
that they have little or no effect upon the
acidity which physicians have proved to be
the root cause of practically all forms of
stomach trouble. An absolutely pure
antacid or neutralising agent must be
employed to neutralise this harmful acid,
and the preparation invariably used in hos-
pitals and prescribed by physicians and
specialists is bisuratcd magnesia. This you
can obtain from all high-class chemists in
either powder or tablet form, and in the
majority of cases half a teaspoonful of the
powder or two tablets taken with a little
water after meals will be found quite suffi-
cient to instantly neutralise excessive acidity
of the stomach and thus prevent all possi-
bility of the food fermenting,*

“B.B.” : The 24th Battalion, 6th Austra-
lian Infantry Brigade, has stamped on its
stationery the figure of an elephant and the
words “No Surrender.” The no-surrender is
good Australian, but where does Jumbo come
in? I know our birds can’t sing and our
flowers are worth nothing, but I didn’t
know things were so bad that we had to go
to Siam or somewhere for an animal.
THE COLD SNAP.
“’Ere! Didn’t ye see the cow buck me orf?"
“Buck? She never bucked! She only sneezed!”
“0.K.” : A while ago I lost faith in the
doctrine that Britain was bound to come
triumphant out of this war. Her workers
in the mines and factories seemed as quar-
relsome dogs, concerned only with their
own petty personal interests, whilst their
opponents were as sheep flocking to the call
of duty. The sheep must win by their habit
of sticking together, I thought. Their
docility and weight of numbers must succeed.
They’d be driven to ultimate victory. Now
I think the growling, discontented, indepen-
dent-spirited British are going to win
through that very character which made me
despair of them. Perhaps the change of
thought is due to my having visited a dog-
show. Those ill-governed Britishers are
quarrelsome dogs, but they will co-operate
sufficiently to win the war in der long r-run,
as the Germans call it. When the dogs ulti-
mately cease growling and barking, we shall
hear the docile sheep bleating in despair.
Then the once-alarmed rulers of Great Brit-
ain will repeat the old truism : “Its dogged
as does it,” and go on mis-governing as
before. To the contentious that the Ger-
mans are wolves or hogs in sheep’s clothing',
and that their nation is a perfect machine
and their unity strength. I reply that poli-
tically they are sheep and their unity is not
strength, and the perfect national machine
was not constructed to bear the strain of a
long war.

“S.S.S.”: Northern Territory Adminis-
trator Gilruth said that “previous to the
advent of the Union (A.W.U.) these diffi-
culties [lack of loading facilities on the
wharf, little or no loading gear, lack of
proper supervision] did not appear to
exist.” And a unionist replied that this
was because the work was “previously
carried on by sweated Chows.” Sweated
Chows in Darwin! Why, the Common-
wealth Government pays Chinese cooks
£2 10s. a week and “keep.” The cook at
the European Hospital in Port Darwin,
whose cooking is of the plainest, gets the
same salary as the white matron, from
whom the Administration demands the high-
est qualifications as a nurse, housekeeper
and dispenser of medicines. The same insti-
tution gives its Chinese wash-boy £9O a
year and keep. He has no other work but
washing, and has his fires lighted for him
and his wood chopped. Also, the hospital
pays a 16-year-old Chow houseboy £7O and
“feund.” The duties of the two are usually
combined in one white-woman “cook and
laundress” at £1 a week in any other Aus-
tralian hospital of the same size. The
Government House “boys”—also Chow!—-
get much the same pay, even though the
place is “not in residence” for the greater
part of the year. When you hear of the
“cheap” Chow in the Northern Territory,
know that the man is talking of something
that doesn’t exist.
“Doc”: Who said the meanest man was
dead? He was very much alive when I
met him on his freehold farm last week. I
had been warned about him, and pitched it
extra-strong when I mentioned our wounded
soldiers and asked him how much I should
put him down for. He explained that
times were too bad; he couldn’t give any-
thing. Argument was wasted on him, and
finally I said, “Well, can I sell you a Bed
Cross button? It’ll cost you a bob.” He
looked at it and handed it back. “No,” he
said, “ ’tain’t worth it.”

A bureau which has undertaken the highly
important and very difficult job of hunting
up information concerning soldiers at the
Front will be opened in Sydney on Monday,
September 13. The headquarters of this
Sherlock Holmes will be 88 Pitt-street, and
the name, number, brigade, etc., of the
sought-after Kangaroo ( plus the cash for a
cable if there’s any urgency) will set the
bureau’s agents on the other side at work.
The Bed Cross Society is responsible for
the scheme, and had started to get it under
weigh, when the legal profession offered to
take it on as its little bit of national ser-
vice. Now there isn’t a Gent One in Syd-
ney worth mentioning who can’t talk Bed
Cross and the value of this new agency,
which gives its services without any charge
whatever. Adrian Knox, K.C., is now on

there, possibly in conjunction with the Bri-
tish Bed Cross, which has over 1500 agents
in Europe, and includes even Constantinople
in its beat. The two, working together,
should be responsible for lifting a large
weight off the mind of the mothers, wives
and sisters of the fellows who have gone out
to meet the big trouble.

Two years ago the barque Susanne Vin-
nen, flying the German flag, blew into New-
castle to load coal. A colliery strike delayed
proceedings for six months. When this was
settled and there was a prospect of getting
cargo aboard, a gale blew up and capsized
the ship. She was righted again and took
in her coal. Then she broke adrift from the
wharf, and wandered around till she was
caught and tied up again. No sooner had
she gathered up her skirts to move on than
war broke out, and Susanne for flying Ger-
man colors was interned. That was 12
months ago, and she had been tied up in
Newcastle till last week, when she was
taken in tow to Melbourne. If anyone says
that wind and weather hadn’t been helping
England to prepare 'for the war for 12
months before it started, the Susanne Vin-
nen is no doubt prepared to call him a liar.

The casual Australian commences early.
One of him the other afternoon, with all the
experience of seven years upon him, set off
in the Newnes Valley—one of the wildest
parts of N. S. Wales —to drive a calf home.
That was the last seen of him for that day
and night. At dawn about 80 men started to
search for the wanderer. After hours of
suspense and struggle in the rough country
they found him going strong. He thought
they had come to help him bring in the
other infant, so when they hove in sight he
cheerfully called out, “I haven’t found her
yef!”
Victoria’s C.J. Madden was lately called
ou to decide a case after his own heart and
to declare the rights of lovely woman. A
married woman of Northcote, owning pro-
perty, had been sued by a grocer fcr £29 3s.
Her lawyer in the lower court was about
to quote authorities showing that the hus-
band, with whom she was living, was liable
for household necessaries, etc., when the
Bench told him that “that was no good to
two old married men like them,” and gave
an order for the amount claimed. His
Honor, of course, upheld the lady’s appeal,
saying her separate estate was not liable
for groceries unless she distinctly made a
bargain to that effect. He also assured the
honorariums that they were no older or
more married than the House of Lords,
whose decision this was. It was all very
neat and proper, no doubt, but mighty un-
satisfactory to the grocer, the husband in
the case being a person cf poor health and
uncertain means.

From London :
Though the war has really made it more blase
than ever, “Society” succeeded in being thrilled the
other day when it learned that the Hon. Venetia
Stanley had become a Jewess. Venetia is a daughter
of Lord Sheffield and a sister of Sir Arthur Stanley,
Governor of Victoria. She is 28, and has been
offered marriage by a brother of Lord Swaythlirg,
who is head of the big Jewish banking firm of the
Montagus, and also chief of the strictest sect of
British Hebrews. As it was impossible for the bride-
groom to become a Christian, the bride acquiesced
in - the suggestion that the situation would be sim-
plified by her becoming a Jewess. The consideration
that at 28 there was no time to lose, and that the
chances of an eligible, noble and wealthy Christian
suitor coming along--were not too rosy, had of course
nothing to do with the case. She merely felt that
it was up to her to maintain the family reputation
for religious acrobatics. An uncle of hers, Lord
Stanley, of Alderly, turned Mahometan, lived a
hermit for the rest of his days, and allowed his
splendid mansion to go to rack and ruin. Another
uncle, the Right Reverend Monsignor Algernon Stan-
ley, seceded from the ranks of the London Church of
England clergy and joined the R.C.’s. He is the
titular Bishop of Emmaus, resides in Rome,
is a domestic prelate at the Vatican, an
assistant at the Papal throne, and, it is
surmised, will have the right to wear a red hat one
of these days. Lord Sheffield, the father of Venetia
and of Victoria’s Governor, has also some ideas of his
own about religion. As Mr. Lyulph Stanley, he sat
in the House of Commons, and while there special-
ised in uncompromising opposition to religious teach-
ing in schools. Make any proposal of that sort, no
matter how vague, and up he would spring like a
jack-in-the-box, and get purple in the face and
crimson in the language.
A PARADOX OF SKIRTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The dress with the seven-yards hem is popular.”
When times were good and peace with olive branches
Fluttered about the dove-cotes of the world,
When no one dreamt that hate’s black avalanches
From heights of Teuton Kultur would be hurled,
You Wrapped yourself so tightly round the ankles
111 hobble garments made of yards so few
That still the memory remains ar.d rankles
Of how with bitter sweat I carried you.
\ c-s, though I took the burden calm and smiling,
And swore I loved you better for the toil,
I spoke with art, your innocence beguiling,
While perspiration made my collar boil.
For you, sweet maid, although so nicely rounded,
Were twelve-stone-six at least those summer days,
And fiercely on my ribs my hot heart pounded
The while I kept my grip upon your stays.
Then extra yards of cloth could be afforded,
Ar.d fashion’s mandate bade you stint its use;
The Webs of busy looms were kept and hoarded
To be in these the leaner years let loose.
For now, when saving cloth might show some reason,
The order comes that gilds resist in vain ;
The stuff to make a proper skirt this season
Is three times longer than a counterpane!
Yard upon yard the thing must flutter round you,
And you, not I, this time must bear the load ;
And when the wind is high—-why, then, confound
you,
Your spread of sail will take Up half the road !
Yet mine the heavier burden still despite the
Plain fact that both your nether limbs are free,
lor, though the change of style perhaps delight the
Bright female mind, the bills Will come to me.
In days of hobble skirts I said I loved you,
And oft I proved it on the hottest day,
Through hours of stress in which I bore or shoved
you,
Pretending that the exercise was play ;
But now, dear girl, that you are my possession,
I carry greater loads, and try to smile.
Yes, though the drear accounts in long procession
Arrive by post, I find you still worth while.

“Spectacles” : I am getting tired of trying
to inflate my brain with war information.
Take t!ie case of cotton. For months past
my feelings have been lacerated by the press
appeals in picture and prose to the British
Government to declare cotton contraband
and so starve the German munition fac-
tories. At last they have done it. Now I
can take my choice of three newspaper clips
—all collected within the last week :—-
No. I.—A German statement that Germany has
heaps more cotton than she is likely to require.
No. 2. —A neutral rumor 'that the German scien-
tists have succeeded in finding a good substitute for
cotton in wood pulp.
No. 3.—A British scientist’s scornful snort to the
effect that only fools believe cotton is necessary at all
in the manufacture of explosives.
I tell you what it is—l’m - sorry I ever
allowed myself to get worked up over the
subject. All I have accomplished is to spoil
mv beautiful ignorance of the subject. And
you know how blissfully-peaccful ignorance
always is !
N.S.W. Full Court has had to decide a
point to which Cold Tea had attached much
importance. According to the Liquor Act
' of 1912 applicants for licenses in electorates
which had survived the local-option poll
could obtain permits for “certain specified
premises.” The prohibition crowd argued
that this meant that the “premises” must be
“specified” in the application, and that,
therefore, a license could not be obtained
till the building actually existed. As nobody
would spend money in erecting a hotel un-
less a license was a certainty, the effect of
this reading of the Act would be that there
would be no new pubs. So that when all
the existing grog emporiums had been burned
down or eaten by white-ants or bombed by
the enemy the day of dry salvation would
dawn. The liquor interests argued that if the
Legislature meant to stop public-houses being
built it would have said so, and that it was
obviously more in the public interest that
new premises should be licensed than that
old ramshackle structures should be patched
up. This latter view has been adopted by
the Full Court, and Cold Tea is busy hunt-
ing up another brilliant point or two.
THE CRITICAL MAID.
STAY-AT-HOME: “Naice girl, eh? Waiting
for some returned hero, I suppose?"
CONVALESOENT: “Ye-es. I thought I was
the goods. But she seems to think I m
only a returned empty."
“Moana”: Apropos the suggestion of
“Jaques” (B. 29/7/’l5) about a simple un-
marrying ceremony. Nothing easier, as
Cochin-China can show. In that free land
when you get tired of your better half or
quarter or one-eighth, as the case may be,
you induce her to decide that she is full up.
Then you call in the nearest witness, gener-
ally the co-re., place a pair of chop-sticks
on a plate, and each party to the fracturing
breaks one in the presence of the witness.
Thus is the marriage tie promptly and irre-
vocably busted.
If Armageddon goes on to the bitter end
it will be like this in the papers:
IMPOSITION ROMANCE.
EXTRAORDINARY STORY TOLD IN COURT.
At No. 1 Police Court yesterday three young
women were charged with conspiring- by divers means
to defraud Eve Merino. They admitted the allega-
tion, but denied having acted with criminal intent.
Constablette Bridget Brogue, who appeared to
prosecute on behalf of the police, in outlining the
case, stated that the three accused had previously been
employed as tram conductors, but were discharged
A TRAINED MAN.
JOHN HENRY : “Ned Writes
that he can sleep through
the roar of battle just as
if he were at home in his
bed. Curious, isn’t it?”
JESSIE MAY : “You wouldn’t think so if
you’d listened to his wife’s sound sleeping.”
on account of riotous conduct. Miss Eve Merino was
one of many persons who had placed advertisements
in the press for husbands. Her ad. (i-page) had
been running for seven months without yielding a
reply, when one morning last week she received a
group photograph showing three young men; A
covering letter stated that any one of them was
open to engagement. Miss Merino, after consulta-
tion with her aunts, who were also advertising copi-
ously, telegraphed to the address given in the letter,
suggesting that a personal interview would be desir-
able, and, further, that the three men should lunch
with her next day. They accepted the invitation,
stayed to dinner, and before leaving it was arranged
that the accused on the left should marry Miss
Merino within 10 days, and the other two should
within a month take to wife the two aunts. The
Bench would understand that under the circumstances
the ladies were delighted, and handed large sums of
money to the accused, for the purpose, it was
alleged, of paying their debts. In all £7624 was so
paid, but the sums involved in the present charge
amounted to only £4260. The suspicions of Detec-
tive Sarah McTavish had, however, been raised by see-
ing in the newspapers an announcement so unpre-
cedented as that three marriages were about to take
place. Following up an important clue, furnished by
a tailor’s cutteress, she was able to unmask the
accused as impostors.
Mrs. Billerkosts (instructed by Mesdames Squarem,
Fixit and Dodgerson), for the accused, said the
defence would be a denial of mens rea; also pleas of
infancy and duress. Her clients were not yet 21.
They admitted, having dressed in male attire, in order
to gratify a distorted sense of humor. But five
minutes after they reached the street they were
pounced upon, bundled into a motor-car, and carried
off to a house near Darling Point. There they were
offered money if they would undertake to get
married, and being in bodily fear of injury accepted
it.
The police intimated that Miss Merino and her
aunts were inmates of a private hospital, each suffer-
ing from a complete breakdown of nerves, cerebro-
spinal meningitis and measles.
Mr. McDublin, S.M., in remanding the accused on
their own recognisances, said that he always took
great care in cases of this sort. Persons in male
attire ran terrible risks. His own bodyguard had
with difficulty prevented a raid being made on him-
self. (Laughter.)
“Gus Gosli”: As a sort of relaxation
from war, Adelaide is on one of its period-
ical anti-Flossie crusades. A series of
articles in the ’Tisek on “Little Hells” set
the Holy City going this time, and fully
500 wowsers are loudly assuring the popula-
tion that they really did not know the char-
acter of some of the nice cool-drink empori-
ums where they went at odd times to quaff a
joyful glass. The young man responsible
for the articles painted a harrowing picture
of the simrile gir-r-1 brought to destruction
by the white slavers who. are in the soda-
water trade. Parliament is threatening the
scoundrels with all sorts of punishments, and
genuine widows who seek an honest penny
from the legitimate ginger pop and lolly
business go about in fear and trembling.
“Spike”: Particulars in the newspapers
of the daily haul made by Sikes and his
gang are becoming alarming, and the people
in my suburb are taking precautions. One
doesn’t mind when a burglar smashes a
jeweller’s window at midday and walks off
with a dish of gold watches. Such things
are part of the risks taken by jewellers, and
the police cannot be expected to attend to
trifles like that when their services are re-
quired hunting up the criminals who neglect
to claim a vote. Also every right-thinking per-
son understands that when a gang of desper-
adoes advances under cover of night and,
without giving fair warning, dynamites the
strongroom at Brandysnaps, it would be
improper to arrive at hasty conclusions
about the detective service. The service has
often to lurk for hours round pubs and
theatres. But when it comes to Sikes and
Co. getting away with sideboards, mangles
and Chesterfield couches from private resi-
dences in broad daylight, there seems reason-
able ground for criticism. Last Sunday the
remnants of the male population left in my
neighborhood spent many strenuous hours
bolting furniture down to the floors, screwing
pictures against walls and fixing padlocks
on the crockery. Also in at least 10 streets
the training of famished bulldogs was in pro-
gress, to the great scandal of the vicar.
Jock McPhairson, of McPhairson and Mac-
parritch, who lost three chests of drawers, a
dining-room table and a grand piano last
week, has rigged up a couple of infernal
machines just inside the front door, and the
first man who tries to sneak Jock’s drawing-
room carpet is going to hit the ceiling before
Mistress McPhairson lets the family tyke
loose. It’s a pretty serious business, this,
anyhow, and somebody ought to see if bikes
cannot be induced to flock to the colors.
Should he resist argument and object to
conscription, then the Government ought to
float a loan and get some superannuated
policemen over with the next lot of foreign
wheat, because, with all the fighting men.
going out of the country, the police will be
left to deal with the situation alone, and
some of us who are staying behind to do the
nation’s work and vote for the referenda
won’t have a chair left to sit on soon.
“Ornis,” from somewhere in Turkish
Asia: —
Some of the Mesopotamian laborers could give
many a hefty Australian wharf-lumper a point or
two in carrying heavy weights. The Arab, normally,
is dirty and lazy, but in the coolie class, although in
many cases an old man and small, he is a plodder.
I have seem them at Busreh, the town where the dates
come from, and which can be spelt in any old way
that you please, unloading mahalas (dhows) and
carrying bales of compressed fodder and sacks weigh-
ing up to 3001 b., and sticking at it all day in a
temperature which for months hovers round 115 deg.
in the shade. When “lumping” they wear a small
hessian bag stuffed with straw, on which the load
rests on the small of the back and suspended by a
piece of webbing round the forehead. Thus they carry
the weight in the best position, bending forward, and
without the necessity of raising the arms above the
head in an unnatural position to steady the load. I
saw the other day an Arab carry a bale of clothing
weighing 3cwt. It was much bigger than he, was
heaved into position on his back by four others,
and was kept in place solely by the web band. Also,
he had to walk over rough ground, barefooted, for
some distance.
“Dove”: Did anyone ever dream that
Peace, the gentle girl with the olive branch
in her arms and the dove perched on her
finger, would be the sort of draggled fugi-
tive she is to-day? Anyone who mentions
her in a kindly way r is at once suspected by
the right-thinkers, and only confirmed luna-
tics mount soap boxes in public parks to
voice sentiments that would have been the
baldest platitudes 18 months ago. The
world is very mad if we judge it by the
way it treats the poor lady. She is “pre-
served” with all sorts of care until war has
definitely set in ; when that stage is reached
she is chased off the premises With high
explosives and poison gas, and any old
friend who tries to remember her kindly is
hurried off to a horse-trough. When she
gets back home after this lot I guess she will
look like the Girl Who Took the Wrong
Turning in Act 111.
* * * *
The other day the police broke into the
studio of an Australian artist whose old
published drawings had been used in a pro-
hibited way. They were there to “seize” all
works and material suspected of being dan-
gerous—and they did. Amongst the stuff
captured and carried off was a sixpenny
edition of Huxley’s “The Evolution of
Species” ! After this any guilty person who
owns a Euclid or a Webster’s Dictionary
had better bury it in the woodshed.
AFTER SAM’S LATEST "NOTE.”
WILLIAM : “I vos not know they vos your

SAM: “How many times is that you've
apologised?”
WILLIAM: “How many? Herr Gott, I vos
not a tally clerk!”
“J.G.”: Where are Irvine and the other
spruikers against preference to unionists?
A gross case occurred the other day, yet
the Iceberg has not even started to melt
with wrath. A Kew East (Vic.) man pur-
chased a property through a firm of estate
agents, and, as usual in such cases, the pur-
chaser had to pay for the cost of conveying
the property from the seller to himself. So,
the buyer asked the agents to have the deeds
fixed up for him. This was done, and
£4 4s. was paid for the job. But the
Gent. One Union, represented by the
Law Institute of Victoria, fell on the
blackleg who drew up the deeds and
dragged him before Madden, C.J., who asked
him to explain why he shouldn’t go to gaol
or be hanged for that, not being a bar-
rister or solicitor of the Supreme Court or
a certificated conveyancer, he prepared with
expectation of gain and reward a convey-
ance of certain land. Stripped of legal
frills, the charge meant that the man who
did the work was not in the lawyers’ union,
and he took on a job that only a law unionist
must touch. After Madden had read the
villain a lecture he fined him £2O with costs.

father being accountant to the S.A. Com-
pany. Prominent himself as a public
accountant, member of the Marine Board,
Swedish consul, and manager at one time
for Elder, Smith and Co. af the Port, lie
came most into the limelight in the ’!)o’s,
when for some seven years he. with chair-
man J. 11. Smith and .John Hill, managed
the State’s railways.
Dead in Adelaide. R. C. Mitton, who had
a long and blameless existence as a teacher.
He did not reach Australia till he was a
married man of nearly 30, but it was long
enough ago for him to join in the rush of
1852 to the Victorian goldfields, and he
afterwards put in 40 years in the cause of
education before retiring for 20-odd years
of leisure. This means that he was 92 at
the end. Mitton will be chiefly remembered
as the most inveterate of unpaid writers for
the newspapers. On every conceivable sub-
ject he turned out letters, long-winded but
well-informed.
“Gent One,” from the southern Speck:—
During part of the two years he was on the Bench
just-deceased Justice Dobbie was a stopgap for Mcln-
tyre, who was sampling six-months’ leave on full pay
while he qualified for a pension. In appointing
Dobbie as Mclntyre’s locum tenens the late Liberal
Government merely dropped on a convenient way of
escape from difficulty. An appointment of some sort
had to be made. The political candidates for the billet
presented an embarrassing choice. So the Ministry
shelved trouble by temporarily appointing Dobbie,
then a civil servant, and fervently praying that some-
thing might turn up before Mclntyre’s leave ex-
pired. It did turn up. Before the six months were,
out a Labor Ministry had taken office. Having no
lawyer of its own to oblige it concluded that Dobbie
was equal to the work, and decorated him with a
permanent wig-. When Dodds died, the same Govern-
ment promoted Nicholls to be Chief Justice, and put
up Harold Crisp, who was never suspected of having
any particular views on politics. Thus with one
Judge well under 60 and two others nearer 40 than
50, it seemed that another vacancy on the Bench
was a matter of a decade at least. Kwing garnered
much of the business liberated by Crisp’s elevation,
and consoled himself for hopes deferred by claiming
a silk gown. However, Dobbie’s death from heart
failure has resurrected the old controversy as to the
rival merits of Ewing, Lewis and co., and again a
Labor Government has on hand a piece of patron-
age which cannot benefit any of its supporters. Lewis
is the choice of the “very best” people, but even
those who regard Ewing as possessing more talent
as a nisi prius battler than as a jurist cannot forget
that Lewis’s reputation has not been supported by
achievement in recent years. Doubtless there are
better lawyers than either. But, as with other
things, it takes more than ability to get a Judgeship.
Of a dead bishop :
Bishop Christopher George Barlow, just dead at
Cooina (N.S.AV.), aged 56, was the holder of three
records. He was the first shepherd of purely Aus-
tralian training and ordination to be made an Angli-
can bishop; his election to the see of North
Queensland in 1891 was the first instance in
which the Anglican clergy of any diocese chose
one of their own number to become their
chief; and he was the first Australian bishop
to possess no University qualifications or de-
grees. Barlow was a factory clerk in the London
parish where Stanton, the first to wear Anglican
gaiters in N.Q., was rector. When Stanton was
imported in 1881 to the then newly-formed
bishopric, Barlow followed him to Townsville, and
was ihere trained and afterwards ordained by him.
His first skirmish with Beelzebub was at Mackay, as
curate to Albert Haclaren, who was afterwards the
first Anglican missionary to Papua; and he subse-
quently gave Satan such a hot time on his own
account at Charters Towers and Townsville that in
1891, when Stanton came south to bish at Newcastle,
the Northerners unanimously chose Barlow' to succeed
him. Conservative Anglicans in Sydney and Mel-
bourne were aghast at the idea that, instead of taking
the usual course of importing from the Cold Country
some unknown English rector wdth a total ignorance
of Australian conditions, the North should choose as
its bishop a mere Australian parson who had served
10 years in the ranks of the diocese which he was
now to command. Protests were raised, nominally
on the ground that Barlow was not a “ ’Varsity
man” ; and the then Primate (Saumarez Smith) was
asked to refuse his consent to the election. Eventu-
ally, to partially remove the ostensible cause of com-
plaint, the Archbishop of Canterbury granted Bar-
low' the “Lambeth degree” of D.D.—a power which
survives in the Archbishops of Canterbury from the
pre-Reformation days of papal legates in England.
The present Anglican bishops of Bathurst and Tas-
mania (Long and Stephen) hold similar Lambeth
degrees, as, though they are both M.A.’s of Mel-
bourne, no Australian university grants degrees in
divinity. Barlow bished at Townsville for 11 years,
and then, in 1902, on the death of Bishop Chalmers,
of Goulburn, was chosen by that diocese to succeed
him. He remained there till last Easter, when
he resigned through ill-health. In point of service,
Barlow was the senior Anglican bishop in the Com-
monwealth, though in point of age he was junior to
half a dozen or more. lie died on the day before
his successor (Radford) was enthroned in Goulburn
Cathedral; and Radford’s first official act was to read
the burial service over him. Deceased prelate was
unmarried, though gossip over Sydney and Goulburn
afternoon-tea cups was always busy at selecting a
suitable wife for him. Persistent rumors of his
engagement to Gov. Rawson’s daughter caused both
parties considerable annoyance a few years ago.

Tis a Dirge of Gloom
For an empty tomb
Where there’s plenty’ of room '
For the Things that the War Cannot Kill!
( the war !
As 1 said before:

But these Things that the War Cannot Kill:
The sights" and the sounds as you go your rounds
In search of “trays” or in search of pounds,
In a city where beer and thirst abounds ;
The alarming sights like the sudden lights
That bushmen see on recovery nights ;
And the sudden sounds
That ring in vour ears like the baying of hounds,
Or other more human and terrible sounds
Of the Morning After the Month Before.
But I’m out of my depth and out of bounds.
( the War!)
The nerve-racking rattle that takes you aback—
Like a rattlesnake in a narrow track
Or a snake in the morning in one of your socks—
Of the everlasting collection box
For a “Belgian” band that comes from “the Bocks”—
Or a Servian family on the rocks,
Or a British blare with a Prussia n brogue,
Or some other sort of tin-whistle rogue,
Playing the tunes that are most in vogue.
(I'm sick of the tunes that are most in vogue.)
We can’t have peace, and we can’t have war,
Or a prison gate, or a lock-up door.
Or hospitals for the rich and poor,
Or a church wherein to worship God
( l ve seen the box in the temples, too,
Of the Gods of Asia), but this is true:
B'e can’t do anything, old or new,
But Maud or Marion, Mabel or Madge,
From Mosman or somewhere, puts on a badge
And goes on the everlasting cadge.
And now it is War, and the same old “lay,”
As if we were Turkey, and couldn’t pay,
To keep a war going for half a day,
1 nless AY e helped Us in every way,
From raffling cushions at AVatson’s Bay
To rattling boxes on Circular Quay,
And breaking out on a teapot spree,
Instead of sewing on hooks and eyes,
As we used to do under peaceful skies,
And rattling dishes at wash-up time:
And nailing us down, from den to block,
To a cup at eleven and four o'clock.
(I’m short of rhythm and short of rhyme.)
And 1 Red Cross” branches in shop and hall
Have “Help!” writ largely on window and wall
In letters several inches tall ;
With notes of hysteria which appal
The weak and timid, and raise the gall
of real Australians (damn it all!),
And amuse our enemies, great and small.
AVhy can’t we have pride and be dignified.
And sweep all this feminine rubbish aside?
They mostly belong, it can’t be denied,
To the poodle-christening, Dame-worshioing side,
And they seize every ghost of a chance to have
Their Little Importance magnified.
“10very woman's a barmaid at heart!”
But not every one has the barmaid’s pride,
Nor the barmaid’s heart, nor the barmaid’s tact,
Xor the barmaid’s unusual gift to see
The General Fitness of Things and Fact,
And much less the barmaid’s sincerity.
I thought political women were dead.
But find they are sharpening their axes instead;
And each, as hopelessly off her head,
Determined lo go on just as before,
Only more,
“After the AVar.” (God bless the War!)
In the meantime, .Airs. Labor Brown,
And Mrs. Liberal Half-a-Crown,
And several Suffragettes of note,
AVho don't know women have got the vote,
Are chasing each other around the town,
And pleading wildly for pillow-slips
And table-napkins and necktie clips,
- v "d chocolate creams—the same old stunt—
And other rubbish to send to the Front,
To help ’em to bear the battle’s brunt.

COLUMN
The Commonwealth Government asked
for the loan of £5,000,000, and was
offered £12,082,410, with perhaps a
few more thousands to be added in
respect of applications which are the
subject of inquiry. For three days after
the list closed on August 81 applicants were
being heard from ; but they had to be turned
away for the present. Their change will
come later on. The applications came ~lh
this way:—•
Applications. Amount.
New South Wales .. 4,.750: £5,383,710
Victoria .. .. 8,072 5,137,560
Queensland.. .. 1,523 1,007,720

AVestralia .. .. 456 206,560
Tasmania .. .. 599 352,740
Totals .. 16,747 £12,932,410
The largest individual applicant was the
Mutual Life and Citizens’, which asked for
£1,0(10,000; the Commonwealth Bank
applied for £500,000; the A.M.P., Bank of
N. S. Wales, Bank of Australasia and
Union Bank took £250,000 each; and among
private persons the biggest lot —£150.000
was asked for by R. Barr Smith, of
Adelaide, the tine old squatter and merchant
who so generously helped to build the
Adelaide Trades Hall. The issue is already
at a small premium.

The State Advances Office runs other
branches which makie loans to workers for
building or buying homes, and to local
authorities. The settlers’ branch is, however,
the first-born and still the most important
member of the family.
The profits shown under that heading in
the table are not the real thing. The prac-
tice is to borrow money at so low a nominal
rate of interest that the loan can only be
placed at a discount. In other words, in
consideration of paying only (say) 31 p.c.
this State bank promises to accept (say)
£97 and call it £lOO and pay a full £lOO
back when the term for which the money
is lent is up. Plainly a profit shown by
charging only the bogus rate of interest is
fictitious. However, this bank does more,
than a fair thing in regard to the discount:
out of the year’s profits it usually provides the
whole of the discount on the loans raised
during that year. The total of these “loan
charges” standing in the balance-sheet as
an asset —that is to say, not made good out
of past profits—is now £30,000. Provided
nothing goes wrong with the securities, the
effect should be to permit the bank to show
very much superior net profits in the future,
because, though the discounts have now
been nearly all made good, the interest pay-
able will be the very low rate at which the
loan was floated in the first place.
And the bank can quite comfortably do
with bigger profits and much larger reserves.
For the reserves constitute all the capital;
and £362,000 is no tremendous cover for
risks running to eight million pounds. The
outstanding mortgages have moved up like
this:—
1904 ..£2.795,849 | 1910 ..£5,662,973
1905 . . 2,753,182 | 1911 . . 6,140,984
1906 . . 3,125,069 j 1912 . . 7,295,768
1907 . . 3,551,876 | 1913 . . 7,451,127
1908 .. 4,180,616 | 1914 .. 7,722,143
1909 . . 5,114,300 j m 5 . . 7,976,974
And there is another £300.000 or so risked
in “temporary investments” and other
things not quite so insufficiently described
as that. Remembering that the advances
are as a rule to be reduced by annual pay-
ments, £360,000 might be regarded as quite
good cover. But land values have risen so
preposterously in the Dominion that ordi-
nary rules don’t apply. Only high prices
for farm and station produce could possibly
have maintained the level of values of the
Past few years; and even with high prices
that level has only been maintained by the
ease with which mortgage loans have been
obtainable through this and other agencies.
Which means that such an institution as
this, projected by John Ballance for the
benefit of the small settler, has been pressed
into the service of the speculator, and has
been a screw-jack for lifting land values.
And high land values are a curse. However,
for present purposes all this is only of in-
terest as indicating that Maoriland land
values are unstable, and that still bigger
reserves are needed by this bank if some
(lay the State is not to be compelled to go
to its rescue, as it had to go to the rescue
of the Bank of New Zealand after a former
boom.
. There is one outstanding piece of quackery
in the accounts. The assets show —"Sinking
funds, £485,653.” Not one penny of this is
sinking fund in the proper sense of the
term. Not one penny of it is profit put aside
tor the extinguishing ,of debt. The whole
process seems to be afiffcst ip,credibly fool-
ish. Ihe bank borrows fKjii. Ifistead of
using the whole lot in its business it pays £1
or so either to the public trustee or to the
Ac.\ances Office Sinking Fund. Having
been thus diverted, the money is used for
precisely the same purposes as if it hadn’t
been diverted at all. Who is this designed

The directors have put by £3OOO towards the
war tax, and this amount has been de-
r-nav! . from the half-year’s profits. If this
£oooo is counted in, the profits show up
better than those disclosed for any previous
winter half-year. The important question
always is, Were the disclosed profits really
earned: No big co. knows exactly how much
profit it makes in any given term, because,
tor one thing, in a business like this it
doesn t know exactly how much revenue it
ought to write* off to cover depreciation, and
tor another thing it doesn’t know how much
ot its book debts it will be able to collect.
As a general thing this co. has provided
amply for wastage. Year after year the
directors have told shareholders: "The
machinery and plant have been main-
tamed in a high state of efficiency
and all expenditure in connection there-
with has been defrayed out of cur-
rent revenue as heretofore.” Moreover
not satisfied with “maintaining” plant—-
which, especially in time of prosperity, is
liable to embrace all kinds of additions—a
halt-yearly appropriation has been made for
depreciation. This appears to be an extra
provision—an additional half-pint run into
the policeman s _ keg after four quarts had
been measured in. to make quite sure that
the John was getting a gallon.
But a Board, even when it appears to be
allowing very liberally for depreciation, may
be overlooking something that doesn’t seem
to be liable to decay, but is really dry-rotting
mside. For instance, 18 months ago who
would have. thought that before this year
was out Britain would be closing the pubs
in some of the “best” districts —“best” from
the liquor trade point of view—till four in
the afternoon? Or who would have thought
that Victoria would have so soon shut all its
pubs at 9.30? These changes must mean
very serious depreciation of assets; and
there are only two ways in which that loss
of value can be provided for —(1) by writ-
ing oil capital as having disappeared; (2)
by wiping out accumulated or current profits.
Ihe Bulletin doesn’t know whether
Tooheys have beeii providing for such
a contingency as this. But, in anv
case, the investor lias' to keep in mind
the special risk of this business—the
large depreciation of assets throu<di
legislation, which is trending all in
one direction. It is no answer to say—“Ho
the breweries will be all right. The law
won’t keep people from drinking.” Even if
the people did drink as much at home, there
would still be heavy losses in value to be
made good by those brewing cos. which are
the landlords of many pubs. The pendulum
which has been swung towards anti-grog dur-
ing the war may possibly fly back after the
war. That can only be a matter of opinion.
But the man who is prepared to take the
risk isn’t so much an investor as a specu-
lator.
Looking back over Tooheys’ accounts for
five years these movements show up:—

There’s no shadow of doubt about the fat-
ness of the past five years. While liabilities
have increased by less than £50,000. the co
has £34,000 more in stocks and £64.000 more
on its books ; and anything over £lOO.OOO has
been spent on freehold pubs and new works

some sort of hint of the real size of the

producing assets.

The trading profit for the year was £21,015,
as against £31,988 in the preceding 12
months ; but though that showed a drop of
£10,828, administration and standing
charges could only be reduced by £2585.
Hence a serious shrinkage in the net profit,
followed by the passing of the div. on the
ordinary shares for the last quarter of the
year “on account of the war and the
drought.” Why war and drought should
have punished this co. so very severely isn't
obvious. It seems almost incredible that
tlie demand for boots and shoes should have
slumped so badly as the figures relating to
profit suggest, even allowing that the policy
of the average retailer has doubtless been
to work down his stocks ny reducing his
purchases. However, there are the figures,
and there is nothing in the accounts which
can explain away their significance. In fact,
it is doubtful whether the true net profit
was a.s much as £8612, because, though
depreciation may possibly have been pro-
vided for, that provision has hitherto been
made by additions to a plant renewal
account, and there has been no addition this
year. So far as plant is concerned, there
-. probably isn’t any serious depreciation to
provide for. The Marshall Go. used to work
its own machines, unlike the majority of
manufacturers in the business, who find it
better to lease the plant from the patentees.
A couple of years or so ago it is said, that
this co. joined the majority; and that,, by
the way, was put forward by the friends
of the patentees of the mostly-Yankee
machines as the explanation of the bigger
profit shown on June 80, 1914. Since credit
was thus taken for the bigger profits of
1914, it is to be hoped nobody will be so
unkind as to suggest that the same thing
should be now debited with the lesser profits
of 1915.
Still, if the profits have shrunk so much,
the co. is in no worse position otherwise.
Liabilities in 1914 were £22.200; they ; are
now £24,088. But while there has been
that increase of only £2423 in debt, some-
thing like £4500 has b’een put into premises
and plant. £7OOO into stock, and a trifle in
the till. This has only been possible by the
reduction of book-debts, which now amount
to £26,808. as against £42,400 last year. So
far as this is not due to a diminished turn-
over the reduction is one of the good features
of the accounts.

Now the uever-againers have their chance.
They can’t kill the trade of the enemy with
their mouths. But they can kill it by in-
sisting on Australian goods. To merely
refuse to take enemy goods is not enough.
You can never be sure that what is marked
“Swiss” or “Made in Holland” isn’t Ger-
man. But when you see the name and
trade-mark of an Australian firm on the
goods, then you can be sure that you are
getting your punch in all right. Cos. like
this one have quite enough troubles without
having to convert Australians to the use of
Australian goods. They are a long way
from the pulse of Fashion, for one thing,
and can’t tell very well how that uncertain
cat is going to jump; and that is liable to
mean heavy loss, as it did last year, when
the cat did a somersault. Further, labor
hasn’t quite found itself yet in Australia:
it hasn’t wholly got rid of the idea that you
can make money by the beautifully simple
process of punching the atmosphere. There
has been a lot of sneering lately at the
I.W.W. cranks for calling on the workers
to go slow and make the work go round;
but the I.W.W. cranks put into words what
thousands of others put into their daily
lives. In one breath these people say “Labor
produces all,” and in the next they advise
Labor to produce as little as it can. though,
since it produces all, if it produces but a
little there plainly can be but a little for
it to have. However, these things will right
themselves in time, and the Australian work-
man will recognise that the more he pro-
duces the more there is for him to get. And
when he realises that, and “bogs in.” indus-
tries like the Austral Hat Mills will have a
much smoother passage.
When a co. shows a fair profit and doesn’t
pay a dividend, the first thing you may
usually suspect is that its banker won’t let
it. In this case that Gorgon can’t be. stand-
ing in the way, since liabilities of all kinds
total only £484, while the co. has £3556 of
cash and over £3OOO of semi-liquid assets
(book debts, etc.). Presumably the direc-
tors see early and good use for the £3OOO-
- of cash in hand, otherwise shareholders
might very reasonably have had a taste.
For the rest, the capital is represented
mostly by stock, but partly by freeholds and
plant; and the plant seems to have been kept
adequately written down.

This co., which ought to be doing well under
all conditions,' has done very well, as a rule,
only when the country has been on a bor-
rowing spree. * Instead of settling down to
steady development the party politician
comes along and produces a bogus prosperity
to show how much better he is than the
other fellow. Then the bottom falls out, and
a few grey years are spent in cleaning up
the mess. Australia has been having one
of its wild sprees. In 1902 and onwards
for the first five years shown in the table,
the total public borrowings of Australia
averaged under £4,000,000 a year. For the
12 months before the war it was £21,000,000.
Ic had been bounding up year after year—
seven, eight, eleven, sixteen, eighteen,
twenty-one. Next year, it seems, we shall
have sackcloth and ashes, and maybe a
hardly-secured eight millions amongst the
lot, excluding, of course, the Common-
wealth. And then Walker’s, which has
“been fully employed throughout the year,
principally on contracts for locomotives for
the Commonwealth. S. Aus. and Queensland
railways.” will probably have to fall back
to the old odd job and the attenuated divi-
dend. We shall know quite well that we
ought to go on building locomotives all the
time: but. unless we turn over a new leaf,
we shall put up with what we have until
we must shift a bigger load than usual, and
then we shall rush away orders to the
U.S.A.. or Britain, or Japan, or Germany—
anywhere, in fact. Walker’s, Ltd., have
done wonderfully well during the past six
years ; but he is an optimist who thinks that
what they have done is a. fair average of
what they are likely to do in the next seven
years.
Meantime, however, the co. has put a lot
of fat on its bones to help it through a lean
time. Look at this :

The first time in the history of this distress-
a ne t Profit has been exhibited!
lhe dotation—guided from England—was
almost as bad .as it could be, and the man-
agement for some years afterwards was no
better. Then there was & reconstruction
and the control was transferred to Sydney •
whereon things improved, though, if tire cook
is to be judged by her pudding, it is still
nothing to boast about. The goodwill account
was not completely wiped out in the recon-
struction, although plainly goodwill was not
really worth a cent. This item still stands
at £2903, and represents the bulk of the
£ooB6 of capital which, according to the
table, lias no tangible assets against it. On
wi® ' °th e r side, there is a “reserve account,
£o<~’ ; but that has been disregarded, as it
is apparently merely a reserve against doubt-
ful _ debts, etc. Book debts run to £1994.
which seems an extravagant figure in view
of the nature of the business and seeing
that the revenue for the half-year was
only £B3 <4.. The financial position is satis-
factory. Liabilities on all accounts amount
to only £BO2. Assets include motor-cabs
< ?.<^ oc k s ’ f 1 9 ,°43; leasehold and plant,
; book debts, £1994 ; cash, etc.. £2038.
The security for the capital thus depends
mainly upon the actual value of the motor-
cars and other plant; and that can’t be told
from the published figures. The best that
can be said is that, in spite of adverse con-
ditions, the Profit and Loss account has
greatly improved; and shareholders, most
of whom had no doubt given up hope long
ago, may even find a flicker of the lost sub-
stance returning to them.

Occidental, near Cobar (N.S.W.), cannot
boast of much profit, but the directors are
hopeful, and intend sinking the main shaft
another lift and purchasing a better plant.
The deepest level at 640 ft. is supplying the
hulk of the crushing stuff, and a winze sunk
58ft. below No. 6 is on a good shoot, aver-
aging £2 19s. 2d. per ton. Still the mine in
the sulphide zone has been patchy and re-
fractory. Recoveries are only 85 p.c. of the
gold value, which means 17s. out of 20s.
During the half-year to August 4 9340 tons
wore raised, averaging £2 3s. 9d. per ton.
of which £1 19s. Old. was recovered. The
profit was only nominal, but a strike has to
take some of the blame.

ALUMINOFERRIC is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-

for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams. etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

Providence tempers the wind to this mature
lamb by arranging that in time of drought,
when things in the Deniliquin district are
liable to be awful, owners shall struggle to
save the last of their starving stock by truck-
ing them south or railing fodder up north to
them. So, though in the past half-year
passenger and general traffic fell .away badly,
the total receipts were £10,960 as against
£8857 in the first half of 1914 and £7548 in
the first half of 1913. This, freight isn't
very profitable; nevertheless it was a help,
and the co. made a much better .profit than
usual in the first half of the yaAr. Taking
it over a long period the co. offers an invest-
ment with neither shocks nor thrills in it.
For many years past it has paid a steady
7 p.c., and, besides, has improved its cash
position like this :

Meantime whatever money has been spent
on permanent way and equipment has come
out of revenue and been charged up to cur-
rent exes. Even assuming that there has
been some depreciation which lias not been
covered by current renewals and additions,
it is hardly likely to amount to £35,000,
seeing that the total capital expenditure is
only £162,672. Hence the margin earned
beyond the dividend looks very comfortable.

When difficulties were overcoming the
Hydro-Electric Co., which was going to
supply enough light and power from its
Great Lake works to make llobart hum, the
Hobart Gas Co. did a good stroke of busi-
ness by buying out its reticulation scheme
in Hobart and going into the electricity
business pretty strongly. Now the Govern-
ment, having taken over the hydro-electric
scheme, is offering to buy out the Gas Co.'s
electrical undertakings, lock, stock and
barrel, for £IOS,OOO or thereabouts. It
looks a good thing- for the Gast Co., for the
total assets are valued at only £185,000, and
the gross receipts from the electrical side are
no more than about £20,000 per year out of a
total of £60,000. On the other hand, the
electric business is swelling visibly, having-
grown last year by 18 per cent., and when
the Government gets its cheap. water-power
the business ought to boom if it is well
managed.
B. H. Junction North has 180.000 issued
shares and 70,000 in reserve. It is proposed
to increase the capital from 20s, to 30s. per
share. Shareholders are to discuss matters
io Sydney on the 16th, and the formal reso-
lution will be put in Melbourne on the
23rd. A two-thirds majority is required to
carry the scheme through. The market is
very dispirited. The co. on September 30,
1914, had assets (cash, stores, concentrates,
slime, etc.) totalling £160,478, against lia-
bilities of £61.215, so on that date, the,
nominal surplus was £99,263. Since then
the nominal surplus is understood to have
been reduced to something like £BO,OOO. But
a slime dump is no good to pay the store-
keeper with, and something has to be done.
In desperation Great Cobar asked the
N.S.W. Government for £40,000 to keep
the mine going. "The request being of course
turned down, all the men. have been put
off. From this it is clear that the effort to
squeeze more money out of the _ English
debenture-holders has thus far failed. It:
has been a ghastly business altogether, and
a fine instance of what some people call
bringing capital into the country. In other
words, the property was sold for an utterly
ridiculous -sum to an Anglo-French co., which
did most things wrong, largely because the
reports on which it bought were absurd.
While the old Cobar Syndicate worked the
mines they were a source of great profit to
the owners and the co. Then the properties
were sold and “foreign capital was intro-
duced,” and the country promptly began to
suffer.

“Blue Geebung” ; As the mine-owners are
not likely to concede the Northern (New-
castle) coal miners demand for a -0 per
cent, increase in wages, the matter may pro-
bably be argued in the Arbitration Court.
If the owners have the common sense to put
in a return of the number of shifts lost by
the men every fortnight, it will require very
forcible argument to convince an unbiased
mind that workers who can afford to take
so many holidays are not receiving sufficient
remuneration for their labor. Increased pay,
which will allow him to miss even more
shifts than at present and still uraw the
same money on pay Saturday, is not likely
to induce the miner to reverse his present
motto —“Pleasure before business —which
is such a serious handicap to this Slate in
building up the very large trade that the
excellence of our coal should secure for it.
Associated (W.A.) treated 127,05 < tons
last financial year for £135,917, and made a
profit of £1960. This surplus was increased
by the balance brought forward to £16,022,
but a 6d. dividend reduced it by £12,384, and
£11,430 written off for development swal-
lowed up the balance, and a few other
charges left a debit of £8659. Work-
ing costs (exclusive of development)
were 19s. Bd., or a fraction of a penny
less than the previous year. The broken ore
in the stopes is estimated at 32,479 tons, as
against 33,306 tons 12 months ago.
Yuanmi (W.A.) has issued an ore re-
serves statement which shows that develop-
ments in the Yuanmi leases are more than
keeping pace with the mill. Only sulphide
ore, however, now remains, the quantity in
sight being 40,713 tons, worth 40s. 7d., com-
pared with 29,635 tons, valued at 40s. 5d., a
year ago. The co.’s other show, the Oroya-
Black Range, is worked out.

Illuminating extract from a letter sent by
manager Bob Nicolson to the Ivanhoe
(W.A.) directors :
Re recent diamond-drilling from the 3320 ft. level.
The porphyry has come over 19ft. since last bore-
hole, and the ore body 404 ft., which is a favorable
development. If the ore body continues at a similar
angle it should be out by the porphyry on the west-
ern side in another 50ft. or so. I would recommend
to sink to 3470 ft., and put in another drill-hole
from bottom of shaft.
Nicolson’s recommendation has been adopted.
North Kalgurli (W.A.) has decided to
economise. Expenses are to be cut down
at the mine, and there may be a change of
managers.

A well-attended funeral service was held
in London last month over the discredited
remains of Chaffer’s (W.A.). The chair-
man mournfully announced that the plant
had cost £39,000, as against an estimate of
£25,000. Also, as foretold on this page some
time before that plant was completed, there
was not enough payable ore developed to
keep it going. A disappointed shareholder
said there had been enough of “mad dog”
management, and he wanted to know what
arrangements had been made for working
the property if fresh capital was put up.
One of the new members of the Board said
that if the reconstruction scheme was
adopted a firm of mining engineers of high
repute would be prepared to take charge.
Reconstruction resolutions were unani-
mously adopted, but Kalgoorlie is dubious
about the success of the scheme, and the
underwriters are likely to be landed with
much of the scrip.
Guy Andrew, a man with American oil
experience, says he has got hold of a big
thing in oil on Bruni Island (Tas.). After
putting in four months wandering round
Port Davey and other remote parts of the
State, he has turned; those districts down
and gone nap on the present proposition,
which is less than 30 miles from Hobart.
He says that near Cape Frederick Henry
there are “tar-wells” formed by the viscous
oily substance exuding from the rocks ; and
he thinks this a dead-sure sign that oil is
there. How much there is of it, he admits,
remains to be proved. About 4000 acres
have been pegged out on behalf of two
syndicates.

When John Craze threw down the pick
at the British Montana, Zeehan (Tas.). to
follow the plough, it looked as if he had
quitted mining for ever. But now he is on
with the old love again, and has gone to
handle the Round Hill, near the Forth
River (Tas.). The district was once known
as the Claude, and had more downs than
ups; but recent work has changed every-
thing. The workings show a width of up
to 50ft. of ore, and loud whoops that the
Round Hill is the biggest lead mine in
Tasmania can now be heard in Collins-
street, Melbourne. A little of the ore is
hot stuff, going 80 p.c. lead and 600 oz. sil-
ver ; but in the bulk it is a concentrating
proposition, and Craze is ‘Scheming out a
plant and a plan of mining work to allow
of an output of 150 tons per shift. So sure
are the knowing ones that Round Hill has
a future that several lots of shares in re-
serve have been rushed at Bs. each by one
or two of Hobart’s fatmen. John Craze
consequently starts off with a full purse,
an unusual experience for West Coast shows.

11. P. Cecil still runs the South Mount
Cameron, Bradshaw’s Creek (Tas.). He
finds it nearly as tough a job to wash profits
into the tin sluice-boxes as it was to make
a do of the old South Long Tunnel. He
walked into Bradshaw’s Creek after the
Chinese had been living on the drifts, and
managed to pay a few dividends till he got
stuck up by the last droughty seasons. Now
it is like old times, when he could run his
nozzles three shifts. But the fogs that settle
down on the Ringarooma Valley are as dense .
as the best products of London, so from
March to June he could handle only 35,500
cub. yards of drift for llj tons stream tin
and a sweetening of gold. This pays the
way, and as the sun strengthens his output
lengthens. There is, however, a little yap-
ping crowd who fail to appreciate Cecil’s
work. They ought to plod round through the
midwinter muds and mists on the. Ringa-
rooma, and they would soon recognise that
this is no soft snap.

Of all Australian mining towns which
were flourishing three or four years ago the
saddest to-day is Zeehan (Tas.). Four-
roomed cottages, with quarter-acre freeholds,
have been sold there lately for £25, and an
eight-roomed house has been leased for ss. a
week.
Andy Kelly’s successor at Coronet Hill.
Northern Territory, is Callanan by name,
and well commended for his copper work.
He has ideas, and goes for a new shaft on
the hanging-wall side. This is to save put-
ting in more pumping power, and, incident-
ally, to prospect another outcrop. The
Commonwealth foots a share of the _ cost,
which, with wages at 15s. a day for miners,
must be high. The co. had only £l3OO in
hand on June 30, so it looks as if it will
have to let out some of its reserve £lO stock
if the claim is to have decent prospecting.
* * * *
“Alarnon” : It is time someone took N.T.
mineowners by the ear and impressed a few
salient facts upon them. Recently a mine-
owner began, with Government assistance,
to re-work an abandoned copper show. For
over 15 years that mine had been idle, and it
was now full of water. The owner pumped
it dry, but allowed all the water to run to
waste, either not knowing or not caring that
it was impregnated with copper. All of the
metal could have been saved, for scrap iron
can be obtained practically for the asking,
and there is always ample timber at hand.
Similarly, half the mines in the N.T. are
littered up with useless machinery that has
been left to wind and weather until it is
ruined. It is an exception to find a mine
in good condition, or with machinery that
has received any intelligent treatment. One-
half the money spent on N.T. mining pro-
positions is wasted, the result of the in-
competence of mineowners and managers.
Devotion to their fetich of Chinese “cheap”
labor is responsible for very poor value
being got for the other half.
* * * *
An “all in” pegging race took place at
Sandstone (W.A.) the other day. Two
prospectors who applied to the Warden for
the same area, and were refused on account
of faulty pegging, rushed out of court and
headed, one on a mule and the other on a
bicycle, towards the coveted claim. The
betting was odds on the bicycle; but Balaam
won out of sight. A Bulletin man was a
starter on a camel in a similar sprint from
Coolgardie in 1894, and had as competitors a
man on a brumby and another driving a pair
in a buekboard buggy. The camel dropped
dead while leading, the brumby fell and
seriously injured its rider, and the driver of
the conveyance went on and afterwards gave
liis opponents a lift home.
“Quidam” on some gold that can t be
taken out again :
' Ararat (Vic.) did some wonderful things in its
day. At White and Blackman’s lead, Chamberlain
and two mates took 400 oz. from a shallow 33ft.
square claim. A pound of gold to the load was
common on the lead, the sinking being from 20ft. to
40ft., and the washdirt 6in. to a foot thick. Later
on, a lot of the headings were taken out profitably.
Rumpling and party got 60oz. to the load in their
claim on Blackman'L On the White Lead “Liver-
pool Jack” got loz. to the load, taking 6ft. deep of
wash. It took him six months to work out his
33ft. claim. The average yield from the White
Lead claims was 251 b. of gold per claim (33ft.).
Ararat, by the way, wasn’t Ararat then, but Mount
William. Later, another field was worked out on the
Grampians, also called Mt. William, but it wasn’t like
the original. Ararat was found by Chinamen from
Adelaide, and worked by them for some time before
the white man got on to the discovery. Most of
the gold went to Adelaide, the S.A. people forming
a road for the police-escorts so as to get a share
of Victoria’s golden harvest. The old track can
still be seen out on the Grampians. There were
many flour-gold leads about Ararat, and thousands
of Chows lived near the Hopkins River for years,
carting flour-gold tailings from the puddlers, and
re-treating them on their big canvas cradles. A few
years ago a Victorian cyanider, rather more than
usually unfinancial, was meditating on some scheme
for making a rise. He suddenly remembered that
when a boy in Ararat he had seen Chows cradling
for flour gold, and any hint of flour gold draws a
Vic. cyanider like a magnet draws iron. He imme-
diately fled to Ararat, and discoverd a flat, hundreds
of acres in extent, composed of alluvial tailings, from
2ft. to 10ft. deep. Shortly afterwards, several plants
were at work on different portions of it, and he got
the rise all right. No newcomer would ever have
suspected that the grass-grown flat on the Hopkins
was composed of “made” auriferous material. As for
the flour gold that must have gone down the Bet Bet
River between Maryborough and Dunolly, from the
old Timor and surrounding diggings, it makes any
cyanide man unhappy to think of it.
Fate of Associated (W.A.) is still in the
balance. During July a working profit of
£lOB7 was made on a turnover of £12,072;
but this surplus was just £l5 short of the
sum expended on so-called development.
Some good patches of ore are occasionally un-
earthed in new ground as well as in parts
of the old workings, that are now being gone
over again, but the margin of profit on the
grade treated is small and sometimes vanishes
altogether. At depth the property is done
for.
Westralia’s “Great Gold Hunt” originated
by “Bullant” Mclntyre, of Southern Cross,
started on September 1. On that day the
hunters, headed by Mac and the town band,
moved out from the Cross and began the
chase. All will be well until Marvel Loch
is passed, and then the expedition is planned
to search the lone, publess land to the south.
Everyone wishes the enterprise success, even
though many think it lacks organisation.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, September 6, 1915.
My Dear Abini, —
Tile Cafe Chan-taut in the Town Hall was
the Amateur Sportsmen’s effort for the
wounded. Nobly supported by their female
relatives, they opened proceedings with the
vice-regal presence and a brass band on
Saturday, and closed it without outside
assistance on Monday. lion, organiser
Hsiick led the Strickland party round the
Elizabethan and Assyrian show after the
official speech had taken the first chill off
ihe ceremony. 11. Y. Brad don, chairman of
*he committee, thanked Sir Gerald "Fitz-
gerald’ for his presence. That slip amended,
and the few remarks hastily concluded, the
band broke loose and split the welkin with its
din, and the lady pirates—who were like the
sands of Manly for number —rushed to busi-
ness, robbery, etc. The Strickland party
then retired to a tea-table, where they got a
few words in edgeways while the concert
proceeded.
Mabel Batchelor; the trio Iris Edgar,
\S yune and Black; and Dorothy Brunton
and C. 11. Workman, of the J.C.W. Co., were
good on the vocal side. The flapper discov-
ered that Workman, who is usually described
through a mouthful of chocolates as “a dear,”
is very bald. This shock over, the Young
Person, who surged round the adjacent tea-
tables, loudly applauded her idol’s frisks
across the platform.
Two shillings entrance for the afternoon’s
show kept down the attendance. The public
only jibs sometimes, and the variation from
the usual “bob” fee —a recognised charge at
these affairs —hurt the daytime rush of vic-
tims. _ Mrs. Corbett, wife of the Sun’s
sporting writer, and Mrs. Wright were look-
ing after sales at one of the most extensive
Queen Bess stalls. A Mena stall (Mrs.
Greatorex in command) was fortified by
damsels dressed in the wriggly-striped, pat-
terned stuff which we suppose Cleopatra
wore at her matin prayers to Osiris. Mrs.
James Shaw and her friends had a cubby-
house that was thick with haggis, tartan
ribbon and Scotch accent. Mrs. Roger Fitz-
hardinge, a lively young matron clad in
rustic brown leather drapery, was responsible
for the safe keeping of the live stock. At
one crisis in the afternoon, two shepherds
arrived to claim a very young lamb, and a
monkey made hideous grimaces at the rest of
the company.
A fancy-dress carnival in the evening-
brought a satisfactory eliuk to the
treasury. Mrs. Smithers, a pretty young
woman dressed like a china-ornament shep-
herdess, was elected Queen of the Carnival.
She made a wobbly progress round the ball-
room in a (-hair carried shoulder high by
shepherds in swallow-tails. The usual in-
stalments of kings, queens and historic
knaves were present in suitable attire. As
her prize Cleopatra (Miss Foley) got a set
of fish knives —in delicate allusion, no doubt,
to Antonio’s Dago origin.
Wattle Day came and went without any
casualties. East year’s free-planting cere-
mony at the Athol Zoo was not repeated.
Perhaps this was because in the interval the
plans of the Zoo have been completely
changed, and trees that were dug in when
the Board of Trustees had the gardens in
hand have been dug out again since the
Public Works Department took over the big
job. The wattle ladies gave away great
sprays of the golden plumage of the bush
at the Soldiers’ Club. Other enthusiasts
whisked up to Liverpool and left their cards
in the same form.
In the thick of Saturday’s dust storm the
St. John Ambulance Society handed over'
two big cars for the Military Hospital’s use.
David Storey (whose son has just been
wounded at Gallipoli) and Surgeon-Colonel
Lane Mullins made suitable remarks on
behalf of Brother Kangaroo.
Sir Thomas Lees, the boyish-looking
baronet who was on Chelmsford’s staff for a
while, was killed in action the other day.
Young Lees found the Society mill a bore,
and preferred to dig out a well-informed Aus-
tralian and get something solid into his listen-
ing ear. He intended to have put up later
for a seat in the House of Commons. In a
letter written in London a few weeks before
the war he said:—
1 am still a Tory in spite of m.v Australian
experiences, because I think that parte stands for
the Empire in the wider sense. But it’s a grand
thing to have had a bit of experience of Greater
Britain —some English people’s ideas of what Aus-
tralia is makes one stare! Australia has opened my
own eyes.
lie looked forward to coming this way again
to complete his education. But a Turkish
bullet found him first.
The bearing of the I)untroon Military Col-
lege youths was one of the features of
General Bridges’ funeral at Canberra last
week. No wonder. The boys had done a
whole month’s steady rehearsal of the de-
pressing ceremonial drill, so that the old
chief might go to his long rest in style. But
they were glad when it was all over. When
you have had a funeral on your mind every
day for a month you’re apt to get tired of
that funeral.
Until September 15 the public can con-
finue to absorb the story of the Trade Fair
at Circular Quay. The Chamber of Com-
merce fathers this show of British, Austra-
lian and Allies’ goods. The china exhibit,
bearing the names of English makers, is a
revelation to those who fancied that Dresden
was the last word in decorative ware. Aus-
tralian goods—notably a line display of
woollens from the backs of our own edible
lambs —are in a conspicuous ascendancy.
►Some of the inedible variety present tlie
other day were so liberally sprayed with
Australian scent that there was an atmo-
sphere of bush flowers. The perfume was
chiefly Eau-de-Sydney—though still, of
course, labelled Eau-de-Cologne.
In artificial flowers the Australian is going
to hold his own with the most exquisite
blooms from Paris workshops. Already there
seems to be nothing lacking but a wider
range of delicate coloring in the pastel
shades. For the rest, the boxes of silky
flowers are lovely enough to break down the
Thrift campaign—to the extent, anvhow, of
a new spring hat. Governor Strickland made
a brief christening speech on the first day of
the Fair, after which the company hung over
the machine that folds and gums envelopes
or buried itself amongst the contents of a
carpenter’s shed, according to its bent,
t aimed music is served up every day, and
afternoon tea is yours for the usual coin.
Captain Dumaresq, who used to be on ex-
Governor Chelmsford’s staff, is now
D.A.Q.G. at Gibraltar. He writes that,
though he was turned down for trench
work, he has the consolation of feeling he is
releasing a better man to go to the Front.
Mr. D’Apice, the Hunter’s Hill moun-
taineer, has been stricken with illness, so
his place on Governor Strickland’s staff is
temporarily filled by the youthful Geoffrey
Hughes. Geoff, is the younger hope of the
Tom Hughes’ family of two sons. Elder
brother -Roger is just about to leave the
Sydney Uni. to go to the war. Now Geof-
frey, in his teens, is vigorously attacking
the theory and practice of aviation, in order
to presently join a flying corps. This study
allows him a few leisure hours a day on
solid earth. So lie’ll “attend” his Ex', till
duty calls him to his angel trade.
Mr. R. E. N. Twopeny, who died in
England the other day, was an easy-going,
gonial half of the Pastora lists’ Review.
The much-travelled, excitable little Cornish
man, skipper A. W. Pearse, is the surviving
partner of the Review founders. Like our
late visitor, Louise Mack, Twopeny was
born in a country parsonage in S. Aus-
tralia; and the Register taught him the
first things he knew about printers’ ink.
Later in life he was mixed up with many
Exhibitions, but returned to his old love
nearly 25 years ago.
The Red Cross Society had a meeting that
filled the Government House ballroom and
overflowed. Lady Edeline took the chair.
Official secretary Budge assisted in waving
the company into its chairs; and the new
hon. aide Hughes, making himself generally
useful, showed no symptoms of feeling his
position more acutely than any other young-
ster who “attended” for tlie first * time.
It. Y. Braddon added a forcible postscript to
speeches by James Ashton and Hanbury
Davies. The latter had to serve out the
meat of the ceremony. Slowly and without
the visible flicker of an eyelash, the legal
man threaded his way through the lanes and
technical by-ways that lead to a Constitu-
tion. “Perhaps you didn’t know it, but
you’ve been working without a Constitution
all this time,” the horrified lawyer whis-
pered. Subdued giggles from the feminine
phalanx indicated cheerful indifference to a
trifle of that kind. Luckily one thing was
certain. No party could grab the Red Cross
and make political capital out of its great
wt u'k.
James Ashton had a quiet undercut at
Prof. Andy Stuart, whose soul was plagued
with a recent outlay on linoleum for a mili-
tary hospital. “After the war we shall be
better able to more sharply define the limi-
tations of Red Cross expenditure. Just now
we cannot always decide whether the money
should come from the cheerful giver or the
reluctant taxpayer. But we do know that
whether our men want comforts, here, in
Egypt, or elsewhere, we must give what we
can.” Marcus Burldtt, the blind boy-
pianist of Mosman, obliged the company with
some music, and then the word went round
that the frail artist would give a concert to
benefit the Sheepskin Vest Fund in St.
James’s on the 13th. AYhereupon those pre-
sent fell upon the refreshments with great
slaughter.
With a lmrried “Good-bye all!” the un-
obtrusive Dr. Halcomb ran up the gang-
way of a P. and O. liner. For months he
has been quietly looking for an opening in
inlanders. When the authorities cabled
Come!” he was off before his patients had
tune to get a word in his ear. Amongst the
lean kine on his books there will be many
a grateful thought for a medico who con-
tinually “forgot” to send in his bill.
Prof. Andy Stuart’s slim lady is presid-
ing over the meetings that are arranging
to send Christmas boxes to the Kangaroos
m the Lemnos Hospital. The “War Chest”
organisation has promised to attend to the
actual delivery of the plum duff, cigarettes,
etc., and will see that they go to whomsoever
they may be addressed. This hospital is
manned by some of our leading surgeons,
with Surgeon-Col. Fiaschi in charge.
The dancing man is either wilting in the
background or pulling on liis boots for the
Front, if he isn't there already. So the
charity ball committee has to face a difficult
problem. Prices and fancy-dress costumes
are the only lure. St. Martha’s Home com-
mittee recently made a double bid for public
support. Visitors played euchre in the
Town Hall vestibule, or scraped together a
thin supply of dancing men—mostly of an
age that carried an exemption certificate on
its face. The first arrival in the ballroom,
by the way, was a lean tortoiseshell cat,
lured by the lights and the smell of cooked
food.
Gallery attractions before the dance in-
cluded infant prodigies who squeaked out
patriotic tunes —to the accompaniment of
a collection-box rattle —and whirlwind
dancers. The lady whirlwind had a hand-
some mane of tawny hair, which her partner
soon shook out of its pins. A wonderful
Catherine wheel, wrought of “a rag, a bone
and a hank of hair,” was wildly encored.
Mark Higgins stage-managed the platform
side of the entertainment. The Tom Hughes
lady, handsomely upholstered in filmy white
and black, was early on the scene! Mrs.
John Toohey trailed raven draperies into
the card-room. Other committee dames in-
cluded Mrs. Chandler, Mrs. W. Macleod,
and Mrs. W. Porter.
A few busybodies on various women’s
societies have been kicking the ball out of
bounds lately. A fierce desire to round up
their own sex (which is responding to the
war cry without any lash) and “organise”
its efforts is the latest obsession. The
National Council of Women has this noisy
bee in its bonnet; and the hum of the insect
is deafening the platform ladies to such an
extent that they can hardly hear their own
oratory. It buzzed at Government House the
other day, with I)r. Arthur preaching from
his favorite text. “Thrift.” Miss Rose Scott,
though not always a safe guide when the
enemy’s guns are booming, has since brought
the Councillors up with a round turn. Their
business, she reminds them incisively, is to
help the weak and tend the wounded and
keep clear of controversy.
Artist Lionel Lindsay is taking in hand
the design for the programmes for Mrs.
Yvonne Charvin’s concert on October 1).
The lady has been whipping up recruits for
a kind of All Nations’ fancy sets. This
spectacle _is likely to include a wide range
of feminine apparel, from the drapery of
Boadicea to the present flounces of Potts
Point.
The Duffy family, of Mosman, who used
to belong to Bundaberg, had a wedding the
other day. Duffy pere is the thoughtful kind
of parent who gives his daughter a new
house, in addition to his blessing, when the
right young man comes along. I fancy the
last bud has now gone to the altar and has
been Mrs. Gray for a week. The church was
so heavily trimmed with white blooms that it
looked like a study in snowdrifts, and the
wedding breakfast flowed with medical com-
forts. The nice-looking bride was disguised
in more than the usual plumage, and only an
expert could tell just where the satin shim-
mer supported the foam of frothy white top-
terraces.
This week sees National Park used for
the first time by Expeditionaries. Years
ago the field artillery used to have their
annual camp there. Now, Holdsworthy
being otherwise engaged, the batteries go
out to the old, picturesque training-ground.
Waverley’s youngest alderman, Jack
Playfair, is on his way home after two
severe bouts with the enemy. Like other
young soldiers, he is over-sensitive about
the damaged appearance he thinks he is
bringing back. But the scars that show are
the symbols of the first wild rush up Galli-
poli, and the Australian girl simply dotes
on heroes who carry such Distinguished
Conduct Marks.
The local musician is possibly “up
against” the war more acutely than any
other professional. The artists earn a bit
of butter (not 'Auntie Sam’s churning,
Please!) by digressing in poster and other
commercial work. But the luckless musi-
cian finds that the public denies itself his
classic goods as its first sacrifice to the war
god. Hence the welcome to a promised
series of Sunday-afternoon “pops.” Maybe
tbe unco’ guid will attempt to pull J.
Brownlow’s hair for starting the notion.
But Paling’s young mall grows a thick
thatch, so he can spare a lock or two.
The young daughters of Captain Lloyd, of
Bose Bay, gave a thrilling sock and ’bacca
party for the 12tli Light Horse on Sept. 3.
They lured their pals to come in great force,
bringing their socks with them. Father is
Assistant Embarkation Officer, with Sapper
-I- H. A. Lee, formerly of the Engineers, as
his chief.
The Lewis family, whose trade-mark (in
conjunction with Whitty’s) is known in every
kitchen and laundry in Australia, had the
name of a representative written on the Roll
of Honor the other day, young Dudley Lewis
having, succumbed at sea while on his way to
a base hospital. His mother lives at Bur-
wood.
The Fresh Air League had a whirling
day for its raid on the affable public. The
grounds of Crow’s Nest, lent by the Hay
dame, had a dressing of khaki to add to
the glory of the occasion. A group of
returned soldiers were the lions of the
party, and Silva Waugh and other damsels
assiduously a ttended to their wants. The vet-
eran Fresh Air Leaguers, Mrs. Kellick, Mrs.
Ernest Broughton, Mrs. Julius Caro, Mrs.
Adamson. Miss Ford and other lady-pirates
wheedled the elusive shillings out of all
comers. The affair was opened by the wife
of Joseph Carruthers. M.L.C.
Mrs. Harry Finn, who evidently fears no
foe, has undertaken to act as referee in a
sock-knitting competition which closes about
the end of October.
The “Gallipoli” bazaar was uncommonly
lucky to worm its way into a Saturday
afternoon when the crowd came into town.
In spite of heat and dust, it threatens to
stand out as a money-making concern. The
stacks of flowers in Dalget.v's premises were
probably from the bosses’ gardens. Manager
Macrae opened the show, which was
arranged by the feminine .portion of the
firm’s staff.
As race week —in a subdued tone, suitable
to the times —brings a modest revival of
spring fashions, who can be blind to the new
chintz muslins? Our girls will look like
bunches of mixed flowers when they billow
round Randwick lawn next month. Posies
of bloom flourish on most of the new season's
goods, and the hats will put forth
young green tendrils on a lattice-work of
azure and blush-rose ribbon. But you.
mustn’t mention this to I)r. Arthur, who is
expounding the doctrine of No New Clothes.
Verbrugghen—who, by the way, looks as
though he is going to succeed in his wicked
scheme to import his teachers —is timing his
big orchestral concert for the fore part of
October. As the Town Hall will house the
debut, one hopes the new Director will watch
the race dates. Hundreds who love a Horse
woidd also like to be present at this festival
of Fiddle.
The Wentworth Hotel winter garden was
lent the other afternoon for the benefit of the
Wentworth Free Kindergarten. This is
growing into shape, chiefly owing to the per-
sistent clamor of Mrs. Francis Anderson.
Up to June last the infant was ministered to
in a local hall. But the premises were so
violently unsuitable that the lease was not
renewed. Meanwhile, the committee boldly
rushed into bricks and mortar. Now the
hunt for cash is fierce.
The Polish Relief Committee (8 Spring-
street) is again on the trail of your half-
crown. Allies’ Day is a long way ahead for
the starving youngsters of ruined Poland.
Miss Boyle O’Reilly, who saw them, calls
them “the war-mad children who have lost
their parents,” and are going blind and deaf
under their mountain of woe.
Violinist Ivy Wigmore, of Perth, passed
this way the other day. After eight years
in England the Westralian girl is returning
to her native town. She has been most of
the time a student at the Royal College of
Music, where Sir Hubert Parry serves out
the thunder. Ivy could write A.It.C.M.
twice after her name if the world wasn’t so
crowded. She took her associateship for
the fiddle, and then got a second helping for
her voice. Two scholarships, besides, are
to her credit. After the social depression
in England and tho nightly gloom of
shrouded London, Ivy feels as if sunny Aus-
tralia was outside the world of the war.
Oswald Anderson, a local song writer,
gave an evening party at the Repertory to
welcome Peter Dawson and buxom Mrs.
Peter. Anderson, like others of the frater-
nity, did well on the other side till war
broke up the harmony. When the Sydney
man arrived in London a few years' ago.
Peter Dawson extended the hand of friend-
ship to some purpose. He introduced the
man who wrote songs to publishers who pro-
duced them. He sang all the said ballads,
and also gave Anderson the bread-and-butter
billet of accompanist on his provincial
tours. So, as several good turns deserve at
least one good return, the Repertory party
greeted the baritone with loud applause.
Yours affectionately.
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, September G, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The remains of Brigadier-General
Bridges were borne up Collins-street to
► pencer-street station on their way to Can-
berra. Khaki boys with purple in their hats
lined the streets from cathedral to station,
ana more of them marched slowly in the
procession to the strains, of a band. Gov-
ernor-General Ferguson, in scarlet, with
white feathers waving from his cocked hat,
looked more gorgeous than Governor Stan-
ley who walked alongside him in subdued
khaki and a flat field,cap. A few paces
behind the Governors and near the gun-
carriage stalked a tall, portly person in
dingy black and prominent white cuffs, with
a dejected high hat on his head and a pol-
ished . gold watch-chain spread over a
capacious black waistcoat. It was the
undertaker. He eyed the Governors in a
sidelong, ruminative manner, as though he
\\ ere, thinking: “You too shall be mine one
day. And yet he may only have been mus-
ing about his corns or his census card.
A posse of politicians, who marched in
ours, had their physique and deportment
shown up witheringly by the splendid
khaki lads _ who followed them. A
tailor watching the procession must have
wept_ tears of mortification to see such
di essing, and a stage manager would have
£ air to see mere supers shuffle so
untidily. Dady Helen fled along side streets
in a purple and silver limousine, and .joined
the Procession at the train. Mrs. Pearce,
the YV ar Minister’s wife, was another who
went the whole, sad journey.
T be Gh-G. turned up at the Brussels Con-
ce't larty at the Auditorium on Saturday
night. He looked ruddier and cheerier than
er ei, and had with him Lady Doris, who was
wrapped in a delicious white fluffy cloak
AVlth a Toby frill round her throat and ears
and prettv Miss Mandeville, from Hobart
who; was cherry-colored about the cheeks and
pale blue about the clothes. Lady Helen
did not appear.
.AH the latest Belgian arrivals of the
higher plane performed. De Bourguignon, at
the piano, played Chopin in a dreamv way.
Ihe chief soprano 0 f the Brussels * Opera
lheatre, Miss Viceroy (in private life
Mrs. Goossens) sang. She Avore tiny bunches
ot Pink, white and blue roses all over.her
decollete gown; they were dotted round the
tunic; also they appeared blushingly from
under transparencies of ninon like pom-pons.
-Lying all the fluffy gown together was a wide
sash of startlingly-blue ribbon, and a big
pmk cabbage-rose was disposed carefully
?™y. slll P s - It was an imposing creation.
Gellist Baroen performs in a soulful manner,
and looks like King Albert the Good. He
played a Love Song composed by Benburg.
Benburg is the composer of the Brahmin
song that Melba turned into a furious
success. When Baroen got going full-soul
ahead on this Benburg Love Song the audi-
ence made a fuss. They dragged him back
AAuth approving noises, and got tAvo encores
out of him. Florent Hoogstoel played his
violin. He broke a string, ana bis hair stood
up more stiffly than ever and his face grew
even more solemn than usual. These Belgians
seem to have forgotten how to smile; they
are so solemn that they might be adherents
and admirers, of that English monarch who
lost his son in a boating* accident, and was
enveloped in gloom for ever after.
The tall Stewart-Richardson man who
"as here as A.D.C. to Lord Denman has
Avntten to Melbourne friends to say that he
is uoav a major. This is still further proof
that he is not dead, as was erroneously
stated by someone the other day. His
brother absorbed no less than eight bullets
last month, but is doing well. They are
both fighting in Gallipoli.
Young Jacob Jona, Avho lately joined the
doctors’ camp at Seymour, after having had
some suburban practice in Richmond and
I ootscray, is now adjutant to Dr. Morton,
medical O.C. Dr. Jona, whose brother Leon,
or Malvern, is an old hand in the A.M.C.. is
a, burly person with the working capacity
of a Clydesdale.
Though women doctors are not encouraged
at the actual Front, there is now a soldiers’
hospital in London at which the medical
staff consists entirely of women. The
Prahran medicine lady who Avas Mary
Henderson, and is noAv Mary Bell, is on the
spot, waiting to lend a hand.
The last of the ancestral shearing-pens
having been booked to such elderly and
grizzled fleece-removers as still remain in
Victoria because they are too old to fight.
Ernest Austin has handed over his share of
tlie sheep-work to the old man, and left for
the war. The Austin souattage is in the
beautiful Mount Emu Creek country.
Mrs. Slawecka. who lives with her
daughter in a quiet street on the South
Yarr'a hill, has two sons on service. When
she came from Paris a decade ago to help
brother Paul Bibron, the waltz-expert, in
his noble work among- the heavy-steppers of
loorak, the handsome woman brought a
couple of young lads with her. One of
these, France Slawecki, went to Egypt with
a field ambulance, and reached the Darda-
nelles early in the fighting; The other son,
Boleslas, has just gone away as sergeant
with a medical outfit. Slawecki the elder
left Bussian Poland to live in Paris when
the revolution made matters uncomfortable
for him and freedom in his own country.
As the Red Cross funds cannot be drawn
on for the purpose, the Willie Smith and
Bob Blackwood matrons have been officially
advised to start a subscription list in Vic-
toria to aid a charitable enterprise of their
own. These, ladies, with Dr. Helen Sexton,
went to Paris to open a convalescent home
at their own expense, and were allotted half!
of a French going concern to work on. Ap-
parently the costs exceeded expectations.
Hence this new hat.
. Lawyer Sidney Stephen, of Brighton, who
is a brother-in-law of John Madden, is repre-
sented at the Front by son Clive, a young
doctor lately out of the Melbourne Univer-
sity. At latest advices lie was working at a
base-hospital near Boulogne.
Major G. PI. Knox has become a Lieut.-
Colonel, and his wife is going to Egypt soon
to congratulate him. The children are to be
left meanwhile at Coonac.
Sep Nichols, who was motoring in Eng-
land with his daughters when the war
started, has turned the conveyance into an
ambulance. It is working in France at pre-
sent, while the daughters sit in London and
sew shirts for soldiers.
The handsome young Baron von Bissing
has not gone to. Germany to fight, after all.
A friend met him on the Block last month.
Let us hope that this statement will dispose
of that other rumor as to his having been
given a commission in an Australian regi-
ment at Gallipoli.
Mrs.. Purves, widow of the K.C., has been
hard hit by the war. Her son Walter was
reported wounded and missing some months
since, and in the last charge of the Victorian
Light Horse another boy, Godfrey, was
killed. : ?
Molly Carew, singer and parlor-vaudevil-
lette, left by the Omrah. This is her second;
voyage.to England. During the previous visit;;
she plighted her troth to a bright young
man who is now a medical officer with an*
R.A.M.C. job in a military hospital. They
are to be married shortly, bar accidents.
Mrs. Fred Hughes, whose Colonel husband
had command of the Light Horse Brigade
which was said to be practically swept
away, endured an anxious few days after
the. great battle. Then came a glad cable
saying that both her husband and son (the
Colonel’s orderly) were safe.
Dr. Ramsay Smith, who seems to have
got things tangled up in Egypt, used to be
the coroner in Adelaide. He is a singularly
abrupt man. One could almost picture him
speaking sharply to the corpse. He never
tempered the curse for the;-negligent official,
or sugared the piil of rebuke in a case of
proven incompetence. Wherefore there are
likely to be plenty who, will gloat over his
evil luck. On the other nail#. be has worked
hard for the under-dog. and has doled out
much kindness under cover of an abrupt
manner. Of recent years he has drawn his
salary as President of the Board of Health.
He has a charming wife and some children,
who are sure to be anxious to know what
all the fuss is about.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Government has decided to purchase the
Mount Crawford estate for £35,000—a bit over £6
an acre. Mr. Murray remains in possession .for three
years, and then takes the whole of fh‘e a purchase
money in Government bonds at 4t per cent.
The Cheer-Up Society is pushing- ahead with its
Soldiers’. Club. All that remains is the question of
a free site. A free plan and free labor for building
the place have already been acquired.
The first annual meeting of the South Aus. Branch
of the Red Cross Society has been arranged for the
Wednesday afternoon of the G.-G.’s visit, when Lady
Helen Munro Ferguson will be one of the speakers.
Others who will say a word or two are Ladv Gal-
way, the Premier, Dr. Stirling, Josiah Syition and
the Rev. D. McNicol. By the way, Dr. Brummit
has given up the cash-box, and Howard Davenport is
treasurer in his stead.
The Master of the Supreme Court, Major W. L.
Stuart, has got leave of absence and gone into train-
ing. Colonel Lovely’s third son is also at the Exhibi-
tion Camp. He was at Mackunda Downs in Northern
Queensland when he heard of his brother’s death
from meningitis. At once settling his business affairs
he came down to fill up the gap in the South Aus.
contingent. The Josiah Symons’ eldest son tem-
porarily forsakes law for soldiering next week, and
departs by the Maloja. He went from St. Peter’s
College to Oxford, and is a junior partner in his
father’s firm.
The hills districts in and about Aldgate and
Crafers couldn’t arrange for their Australia Day
celebrations on July 30, so they ran a carnival on
Saturday, and netted about £OOO for the Wounded
Soldiers’ Fund.
K. L. Duffield, who went from Adelaide to join the
North Devon Hussars, has been appointed transport
officer of his regiment.
We are to have no Eight Hours Procession this
3 f ai , but instead an Anzac Day Procession and Car-
niral on behalf of the Wounded Soldiers’ Fund.
_ Died at Evandale on Monday It. C. Mitton, a one-
time headmaster'of the Pultney-street School. He
was one 1 of the founders of the Preceptors’ Associa-
tion of the Educational Journal, a publica-
tion Which was edited by the late Dean Russell
and which nearly half a century ago advocated an
educational system much on the lines of the one
maintained by the State to-day.
Captain George Landale, who has been
training “Terriers” in England since his re-
turn ]to the army list, is awaiting his call to
the trenches. Walter is already there, and
now there only remains Algy, a tall, fair and
somewhat vacuous young man. And he
expects to be off shortly.
George Chirnside and his daughter Aud-
rey are going to Egypt to help as best they
can. Mrs. George, who is not too robust of
late, will stay on at Werribee, the family’s
bouth Yarra house, Airlie, having been sold
and turned into a private hospital.
A standing daily-paper advt.:—
If you want your military portrait to please
beyond all expectations visit The Bingbang Studios
and wear the smart uniform we specially provide.
Is it a subtle; sneer at the costume supplied
in- e Defeil ce Department, or is it for the
soldier who hasn’t got beyond the dungaree
stage, and whose bush-girl wants a picture
or him in khaki by return mail?
Captain Jimmy Smeal, of the Melbourne
xiosprtal, left the other day with a contingent
ot doctors for service abroad. The committee
gloaned on first hearing of Smeal’s decision
to go, but presently remembered its prime
duty to the Empire, and pulled itself to-
gether to wish him good luck and a safe re-
turn The new, young man at the hospital is
Dr. It. P. McMeekin.
. Ernest Robson, the Classics man of Trin-
ity within Melbourne University, has left
to be honorary assistant-secretarv at the
Ifareneld Park Hospital. This place has
just. be e n converted from a convalescent
institution into a Headquarters Hospital for
serious cases. .
Herewith a few tips for military shirt-
makers :—-
Don’t use flannel collars; they shrink.
Don't have collar higher than fin. It shows above
the tunic.
Don’t forget to put on a cuff that buttons.
Don’t have the front opening shorter than 14in.
Don’t have the yoke (from shoulder to shoulder)
wider than 19in. .
Don't use linen buttons ; they get dirty, and break.
Don’t herringbone; or leave raw edges; or make
pleats ; or put seaihs on the inside. All’these devices
make harbors for vermin.
. Et’orn Rosna. who is staying so long
in London that she is probably rooted there
by now:—
Hymen’s latest Anglo-Australian job was at the
wedding of Harold Ellison, of the High Commis-
sioner’s Office, with Kathleen Gorst, and it happened
at St Mary Abbot's, Kensington. The benedict is
the eldest son of the late Dr. Ellison, of Glenelg
(S.A.). The bride belongs to a scribbling family
and is a grand-daughter of Sir John Gorst, who has
a castle in Wilts. Her father, who lately dropped
his pen for the less mighty weapon, is now a lieu-
tenant in a Territorial regiment, . and came home
wounded from France in time to give the damsel
away. A younger Ellison brother, who is likewise a
lieutenant, upheld the bridegroom, and the Sydney
organist, Arthur Mason, played the Wedding March.
Part of the British Army ran over from France for
the event.
Elizabeth Newbold, the young Victorian siiwer
sends a eooee from Noo Yark. The tuneful girl was
in Italy when the European combustion started and
threatened to spoil her career. However, grand-
opera managers in U.S.A. hearkened unto her with
such good results that at the moment of writing she
had two five-year contracts to choose from.
The breezy subbub of Malvern has a
Choral Union of its very own. The Union,

The beach-side tents of Aspendale, which
have been wowsed and inspected and red-
taped into something approaching Grundy-
ism, have had a last blow dealt at their
aicadian seclusion among the ti-tree. Elec-
tric light has gradually crept across coun-
tl-D,a?D now large arc lamps are being sus-
pended aiong the military road to shine on
fhe righteous and burn up the tender growth
of flirtation.. It isn’t worth while bein<*
young and frivolous these times.
The Fritz Hart Conservatorium—the
music school that Melba patted on the head
is having three culture parties: a lecture-
rc-cual on Cesar Franck on the 10th inst.:
on October S a piano recital by Jessie
Masson; and on October 22 a recital brist-
ling with works by Fritz Hart.

A dear old Dutch lady, the widow of the
late Colonel Lethbridge—an Anglo-Indian—
has just died. She was a daughter of one
Gustav d'Albedyll, an Important in the East
India Company, and had lived in India and
m the East more than half her life. She was
with her son, the Rev. E. Lethbridge, of All
Saints’ Church, Terang, -when the end came.
The Macoboy girls appear at the Audi-
torium on September 14. John Maher,
assistant Town Clerk, is managing the show
for them, and Mrs. Trentham Fryer is at-
tending to the details. They are said to be
glorious, and as they are popular in Sassiety
the concert is expected to boom. Their only
brother, a corporal, attached to the 14th
Battalion, was killed in the landing at Galli-
poli, and the Expeditionaries are anxious to
do the family honor.
“Toddy” Waller, wTo was in Australia
with his father’s company last year, has
been divorced. As Ethel Warwick the wife
played in “The Flag Lieutenant” and other
genteel bellowdramatic productions. Toddy
is a sound actor, with a fine sense of humor
and immense feet. His wife that w 7 as is al
very good-looking Jewmss, but her sense of'
the ridiculous is defective. According to
the law reports of the case, “on leaving the
witness-box she was completely overcome
with emotion, and had to be assisted out of
court by friends in a swooning condition.”
Possibly the sudden shock of seeing the face
of her spouse, with whom she has not been
playing speaks for years, brought the oldi
love back with a rush.
An artistic Australian variety of the little
“Maxim” booklet which flourishes in New
Lcrk and London has been brought out by
Edith Willard, a Melbourne presswoman.
It is clothed in violet cardboard, tied with
mauve ribbon, and titled “Maxims of the
Corset.” The Keystone Printing Co. did
the fixing and Charlie Nuttall put in the
illustrations. The maxims are much as
usual, if not more so. “Anyone can make
a success of modesty—only a‘few succeed
with impudence” is a fair sample. Remarks
on figures, and corsets range from Cleopatra
to the Josephine period, and the advts. are
as. lull of appeal to women-readers as Mrs.
Willard’s advice.
Julius Knight dropped off the express at
Seymour the other week and gave a show.
The house consisted of something like two
men and a boy—not that the recruits were
indifferent to . Superbus, but because menin-
gitis is causing wholesale curtailment of
night leave at the camp just now.
Carlyle Smythe, son of the “Much Trav-
elled,” is providing weekly entertainment sv
for the Australian wounded at Harefield.
Una Bourne, Mrs. Benda, Mona McCaughey '
and Carrie Haase supplied the first per-
formance ; then Alexander Watson gave a
one-man show; and Ada Crosslev. Elsa '
Stralia (who used to be Elsa Fischer) and
others were to follow when the mail left.
After giving shrill voice to two of the
latest shrieks of fashion in “Under Cover,”
at the Royal, Muriel Starr appears, so to
speak, in a perfect dream of a nightie. The
famous garment which Henry James James
married for the purposes of “The Double
Bed Dialogues” could not compare with this
complication of silk and foamy lace, festooned
with pink ribbon. Muriel reveals herself in
this in a bedroom scene, and in the act that
follows, when a burglar alarm has aroused
the house-party, she comes downstairs with-
out putting on anything in the way of a
kimono, but wearing in addition to her
nightie an elaborate cap that looks like an
edition de luxe of the sunbonnet associated
with musical-comedy dairymaids.
The Sandringham goffers made £5OO for
the Red Cross as a result of one day’s
special work. Each round brought the cause
half a sovereign. Lunch was costly, and
every member had a host of women guests.
The weather was straight from the South
Pole, but the girls didn’t much mind having
their skirts, blown. about, since sports boots
are very tricky this season—being high and
laced at. the. side in fine ballet style. Club-
house flirtations, coffee and fur coats w'ere
in high favor throughout the blizzardish day.
When Lady Northcote gave a party at
Government House years ago, her passion
for detail carried her to the tasting of the
soup or coffee she always ordered for the
chauffeurs and coachmen in waiting. >Now T
she is probably overlooking the flavoring
which the tetrarch in her kitchen drops into
the broth for wounded Australians. Thev’re
going in relays to her home, Eastwell Park.

Mahupawa's Curse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Walter hamlin blew into
Poneke in the early days, before
the earthquake had razed part of
the town and provided subject matter for
a latter-day army of hoary-headed violators
of the truth. Knocking round had become
a habit with Walter. But he kept a pair
of sharp eyes on the look-out for the tide
which was to lead on to fortune. At
Poneke something told him that the tide
was due to flow. So he resigned his menial
position on the barque William ,T. Cooker
and started out for the back country. His
resignation was effected by means of a
small iron bar. It was not till two hours
later that the watchman knew what had
struck him, and by that time Walter was
scaling the precipitous sides of the Rimu-
takas and cursing the slop chest of the Wil-
liam J. Cocker for providing him with
brown-paper boots.
On the far side of the mountains he
walked into a Maori kianga and was haled
before Mahupawa. Mahupawa was not
only the chief of the Ngatirunas and boss
tohunga of the whole of Wairarapa, but a
man of discernment. In Walter he recog-
nised a kindred spirit. They became close
friends. But the lotus life was not for Mr.
Hamlin. He saw a local need and deter-
mined to remedy it.
There was a gorgeous spree when the
first fruits of the still were available for
consumption. Walter was acclaimed the
savior of the brown people. As a supreme
honor Mahupawa presented the pakeha with
his daughter. \\ alter had already provided
himself with a bride, so the lady was some-
thing of a superfluity in his menage. But
the dusky property brought appreciable
prestige.
When the high spirits engendered by the
first brew had died down, and the dead had
been buried, and the smouldering feuds
stowed away until the next time, Walter
decided that the time had come to look after
his own interests. He had a heart to heart
talk with Mahupawa. For a small quantity
of waipiro he purchased a large tract of
land. There was plenty of land and not
too much waipiro. Mahupawa intimated he
was always open to do business on the same
terms. Satisfied that the title was all right,
Walter spent two days examining his pro-
perty. Then he returned to the kainga and
called a big korero. Afterwards as many
natives as could be supplied with axes fell
to on the virgin bush. The work continued
for many months, the workers being paid
ia waipiro. The shirkers fell foul of Mahu-
pawa, whose mana as a tohunga exceeded
that of all others, and affliction seized them.
Some died, others merely developed leprosy
and were ostracised by the tribe.
When the Government road at last
arrived from Poneke, and after halting a day
meandered off into the bush again, Walter
utilised it to put his waipiro on the market.
He organised a transport service and a
system of bush telegraphy, and in the
course of years became a wealthy man. He
fenced his property, stocked it, and built a
large house. Then, for the first tisy“ Vr he
went down to Poneke. aiawn
He returned with a pakeha brii 1 / a 1 1 ? d

A CASE IN POINT.
THE MORALIST: “Strange how different causes produce similar results.”
THE CYNIC : "Quite true! Here's Jones won't go to the war because his wife don’t want
him to; and Smith won't go because his wife does want him to.”
For a week Mahupawa spoke to no man.
Then he called the tribe together, and
uttered his curse. It was a terrible and
comprehensive malediction, but it did not
extend to the fourth generation. There
was to be no fourth generation. By way
of inauguration Mahupawa slipped past the
watchers one night, and gaining access to
the homestead blew the greater part of Wal-
ter Hamlin’s head off. Then he went away
and quietly died.
* * * *
The humidity of the night had converted
the fragrance of the bush into a stench that
drifted across the hundred yards of lawn and
garden to the homestead verandah. Perhaps
it was the night which had unbalanced
young Bycroft’s brain and changed the futile
soul-agony into a blood lust, but his pulse
quickened as he lay back in the deep wicker
chair and watched the place in Hamlin’s
bull neck where the knife would sink—if —
if Of course, he knew she loved him and
was only marrying Hamlin because she had
promised him years before. This Bycroft, who
had known her for ten days, had learned in
the rose garden the night before, and by no
word of mouth. At one moment their souls
had almost fused. Only her promise to
Hamlin had made her flee into the house.
God, how he loathed that man! Over the
verandah rails there swung the vision of a
girl with coils and coils of shimmering chest-
nut hair and great grey eyes. Black hate
swamped the boy’s soul, and the vision was
blotted out.
The mutter of talk died down for an
instant. Then the third man spoke. He
was asking about the curse. Only Hender-
son, thought Bycroft, would have had the
bad taste to speak openly of the thing to
Walter Hamlin’s grandson. But it was
balm to Bycroft’s soul to see the red ebb
from Hamlin’s face. There was a pause,
and then the big man spoke from the depths
of his chair.
“Well, yes, old man, there was some talk
of the Curse when the nater made such a
mess of things, but it was only old wives’
talk, I guess. There were good, solid rea-
sons for the old man making an end of it.
Anyhow, I’ve lived for thirty-five years
without being affected by any particular
curse, and as I’m going to be married next
n Sionth there’s not a big chance of the Ham-
lins dying out with the third generation.”
Hamlin got up and stretched himself, and
to put an end to the situation Henderson
did likewise. Then they moved towards the
door. But Bycroft sat very still and
straight in his chair, and his face was white
as death.
Three miles from the homestead was bush-
clad Mahupawa Hill. When Mahupawa’s
body was found on the summit of the hill
the Maoris declared the place tapu, and
it became the habitat of wild pigs and the
breeding-place of many birds. When
Bycroft came up from the south in search
of a station the Hill became an important
asset in Hamlin’s mind. Bycroft had loads
of cash and sporting proclivities. Hamlin
was marrying money—some said for money
—but he wanted all the gold he could lay
hands on. The old man had indeed made a
mess of things.
Bycroft was obsessed by an idea. At
night it took shape as an ever-recurring
nightmare which left him in the morning
a nervous wreck. At breakfast, when Ham-
lin showed in a dozen ways his proprietor-
ship of Letty Gordon, it became a stinging
desire. In the daytime Bycroft generally
rode alone, ostensibly to inspect the pro-
perty. But once away from the homestead
the pasture land received little attention.
His idea drove him to the hill where the
natives said the spirit of Mahupawa roamed
never to be appeased until the last of the
Hamlins was underground. In between
whiles he played tennis with the half-dozen
girl guests, or dallied with Letty Gordon
in the rose garden. It was Letty who
brought him to a decision. The ladies had
begun to talk, and, woman-like, they took
care that Letty should know it. It was not
her nature to evade responsibilities, and she
spoke to Bycroft in level tones and told
him. without sign of feeling, that this was
the end of things. That night Bycroft
announced his desire for some sport on
Mahupawa Hill.
Hamlin was in great spirits while waiting
for the dogcart to come round. Bycroft had
intimated he would buy the place if the hill
proved as food for sporting purposes as its
reputation. With the run sold and the
mother settled comfortably in Wellington
with her sister, Hamlin would be free to
take his long-projected honeymoon trip to
Europe. But Hamlin hardly felt “the thing”
this morning, though he showed his usual
outward aspect of coarse jollity. Standing
apart from the bevy of women who fluttered
around, Bycroft inwardly cursed Henderson
for a clumsy ass. For at the last minute
Henderson had decided to go with them.
Transient compunction gripped Bycroft
when Hamlin’s mother came out to see them
off. Grief and incessant anxiety for her
son’s safety had infirmed but not over-
whelmed Francis Hamlin’s widow. She
spoke cheerfully to Bycroft and wished him
luck in his day’s sport. Then the dogcart
appeared and Hamlin’s leave taking of Letty
Gordon brought a red mist before Bycroft’s
eyes.
At the foot of the hill they tethered the
horse and tumbled the dogs out of the cart.
Hamlin’s boisterousness had continued all
the way, and now he broke into a song
which brought to Bycroft’s mind a vision of
Letty Gordon at the piano and her lover
bending over her. When Henderson joined
the vision faded.
For an hour they climbed behind the mute
dogs through dense underbush. Then Hender-
son lied about a sprained wrist, and started
back for the road. At least, he started back,
and said he was making for the road. As
the sound of his progress through the bush
died down the dogs gave the full-throated
cry of the pig-canine when it has found and
the quarry is not far distant. Hamlin and
Bycroft struggled on. After a while the
dogs’ cry changed to the yapping bark which
denotes that the pig is bailed up. The sound
came from the top of the hill.
Hamlin pushed through the ferns and
entered the clearing, with Bycroft at his
heels. On the far side, a dozen yards away,
with his tail against a huge totara, was an
old-man boar. In front of him the dogs
were doing a song-and-dance turn. For the
dogs the old fellow displayed contempt,
broken by short bursts of senile rage at the
futility of their noisy performance. The
appearance of the men changed his feelings
and tactics. He seemed to suddenly recollect
an appointment made for another place. As
the pig sprang forward with a toss of his
head which opened a dog’s side from flank to
shoulder, Hamlin swung his rifle up. Then
something caught bis foot. He stumbled
and went down. The crack of a rifle hung
in the air, then echoed from gully to gully.
Hamlin lay where he had fallen.
Bycroft never knew how he got down the
hill, and found Henderson and the cart. As
a matter of fact, Henderson found him. He
was incoherent then, and still more so at the
homestead. But he received a lot of sym-
pathy.
* * * *
Six months after Hamlin’s death Bycroft
returned from a tour of the world. On tha
second night after he arrived in Wellington
he proposed to Letty Gordon, and was re-
fused. The lady had just accepted Hender-
son.
Then Bycroft went away and buried him-
self in the bush. But Henderson found him
out, and dragged him back to civilisation.
Henderson was a human vampire, and threat-
ened to suck him dry.

THE QUESTION.
HIS WORSHIP (to plaintiff): “Do you mean
to infer that the defendant made over-
tures to you of a financial character
prior to the theft?” (Question repeated,
and no response from stupid witness.)
"Constable, see if you can make the
man understand.”
CONSTABLE: “Tell his Washup did the
prisoner put the acid on yell afore lie
lunched per dough?”
Sugna” : The vegetable’s birthplace has a
good deal to do with the warpableness of timber.
But the district to which it is transplanted has
still more to do with it. I have been all my life
at the game, yet until I went to Canberra I didn’t
know what wood could do in the contortion line. I
knew a squatter who when he shifted to the locality
of Canberra (then Acton) from another part of N.
S. Wales, brought a valuable old fiddle with him'.
It had been in the family over 100 years, he said,
yet it had not been long in its new home when it
began to show signs of warp. The same thing hap-
pened in the case of an old flute. What price, then,
Oregon and N.S.W. hardwood, which have been
mostly used for building at Canberra? If it comes
to handing out first prize for wriggling I’ll nominate
tallow-wood against “Boronia’s” (B. 19/8/’l5)
jarrah. If the contest is held at Canberra, even a
rib of the Ark could be guaranteed to get out of
plumb.
‘’Outcast”: You don’t expect to be hard
pressed for water in a country like Papua (the
general complaint is that most spots there get too
much of it), but as a matter of fact there is a
huge area where fresh Adam’s ale is as hard to find
as a non-borrowing Australian Treasurer. From
Orokolo to the Dutch boundary I reckon you can’t
find decent fresh water anywhere along the coast.
F.ven the nigs., and there are a good many thousand
of them in this area, have to depend mostly on
either cocoanuts or the rain-water collected in their
canoes. If you want to get drinking-water anywhere
between the bight of the Papuan Gulf and the mouth
of the Bensbach you have to go from 20 to 80 miles
up one or other of the rivers. In the mountain
country things are not quite as bad, but if you climb
up high the chances are you won’t get any water
along the ranges. Have had much personal experi-
ence of having to spread canvas to catch rain at night
to get enough to cook grub for self and the boys. In
the country back of the Papuan Gulf the formation
is mostly limestone, and the country carries no sur-
face water. It doesn’t even carry beer.
* * * ' *
“The Wanderer” : On the Upper Manning
(N.S.W.) there is a place called “The Cells.” To
thal title hangs a tale. In the spring of 1847, in the
“bad old days of Port Macquarie,” Governor and
Lady £ itzroy visited that settlement. Major A. C.
Innes met the party at what was then the Major’s
cattle station, Glen Innes, now a thriving town.
From there their Exes, passed on to Yarrowitch, an-
ot lei of Innes’s stations, thence to a wayside camp.
Here the Major had had a large wooden hut erected
tor their accommodation. The bedrooms were so
small that they were more like ordinary convict cells
than anything else—so much so, in fact, that it is
recorded the Major, when the bed-hour came, asked
Ins guests whether they were ready “to retire to their
cells. The pleasantry is perpetuated in the name.
* * *
“Jaques”: “Viking” (B. 19/8/T5) asks
if foxes have been spotted further north than Nanango
(Q.). Yes, they have been cursed at settlements on
the Daly River. I dunno whether it’s necessary to
mention that the Daly is 800 miles nearer the North
Pole than Nanango.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: A word with “Pick” (B.
12/8/ 15). After groping in much obscurity on the
subject of eel-birth, scientists with rare
exceptions now acknowledge that the
young elvers come to life in the depths
of the sea. The chief objections to
this theory are (1) that young eels
an inch or so long are found at the
head of streams miles from the sea,
and (2) on the top side of waterfalls.
But shoals of infantile wrigglers have
often been observed entering the mouths
of rivers and getting a gait on up-
stream. Coming to waterfalls, obser-
vation again butts in. Hopkins Palls,
near Warrnambool (Vic.), would at
first glance appear an impassable bar-
rier to the small worms. Yet repeat-
edly they have been seen working their
passage up the wet rocks there as in
similar places. Anyone with time and
patience can verify these two facts for
himself. To refute the sea-breeding
theory a given number of eels would
have to be put under observation in
perfectly natural surroundings, except-
ing that there would be no exit or
entrance for them. If young were then
found it would be a starting-poiut for
assailing the established theory. The
trouble is we too readily accept any
old yarn that “bush naturalists'’ put
up on us, such, for instance, as that
eels have their origin in horsehair, that
snakes won’t relinquish the ghost till
sunset, that young ’roos are born in
the pouch, that politicians feather their
nests, and that jackeroos swallow their
young. Wherefore, no eel-breeding
scheme will collect my credence till
that of the scientists hits been publicly poisoned.
* * * *
Sarto”: Cheers for another good Aus-
tralian the she-oak. During the recently-deceased
drought many cattle were not only kept alive but
fattened on its leaves. While I’m handing out
references I may as well pass one to the quandong
or wild cherry, whose fruit in the bush has cheered
up many a man and made many a pot of jam for
Mrs. Mulga. When Nature invented the quandong
she was off her rocker, because she placed the stone
on the outside of the fruit.
LOCAL INFORMATION.
PARSON : “And have you found the true spirit, brother?”
RAFFERTY : “Ye’re a shtranger to thase parrts, so I'll till ye this. Ye take my straight
tip and stick to beer while ye re at ’ Innissey's."
Baicoo : I quoted to a canny engineer
“Mulga’s” argument (B. 12/8/’l5) that gidya was
the timber for stoking. “Aye,” he said, “if ye use
the other fellow’s boiler.” The heat from gidya, he
explained, was too fierce and burnt out the “coffee-
pot ’ too quickly. “Next to coal,” said this expert,
is coolibali. It gives a steady, regular heat, last-
ing, and with little ash. But, ye ken, if I were in
Mest or Nor’-West Queensland I’d be speering for
wilga or vinetree.”
*‘ * *
“Pick”: With the solitary exception of
Queensland teak “Boronia” hasn’t a hope of finding
any Australian timber which will not, in a greater
or lesser degree, warp and shrink, just like Westra-
uan jarrah (B. 19/8/’l5). Further, jarrah does not
hold the warp championship. That is rightly claimed
V the silky oak of N. S. Wales. Even though it be
tremendously weighted down and kept in the dark
until absolutely dead, it invariably springs when
worked. Its beautiful grain and color make it a
suitable wood for fancy parts in the construction of
vehicle bodies, but it must be iron-braced on all sides
or on the first run it will twist. Wood shrinkage is
ue to sap, and may be overcome by immersing the
gieen timber m water or oil. The soakage drives
out the sap, and thereafter, when dry, the stuff may
o relied upon to keep its measurements.

THE SNAKE THAT BIT O'REILLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O Reilly cooked at Grundell ere he stood out on the
grass;
The shearer chaps esteemed him somewhat highly,
I'or though he lathered up a treat, and pubs he
couldn’t pass,
And did his silver in with blacks and folk of little
class,
Of all the Murrumbidgee cooks from Mungadale to
Yass
There was none could hold a candle to O’Reilly.
His duffs were just the glassy, and his rock-me dols
a treat;
liis soup had been acclaimed by “Booser” Smiley ;
His sea-pie was a luxury that aldermen might eat,
His brownie like a wedding cake; his bread you
couldn’t beat.
A lazy, fat and surly bloke, but, chef from head to
feet,
The shearers voted solid for O’Reilly.
He donned his cap and apron, and he cooked for
Outback Joe.
“I’ll fatten up the brutes,” said Patrick, dryly.
He snatched his cheque at Cut-Out, and he ducked
for Pongelo,
And into awful Carathool The simpleton must go,
Where Johns are swift and sudden, and the town is
Holy Joe.
On a roaring razzle-dazzle went O’Reilly.
He put the peg in later, when the town was painted
red.
His face and beak were likewise tinted highly.
The welkin shook next morning when he tumbled
from his bed
With roars of “Strike me bandy!” and appeals to
“Strike me dead!”—
Upon a tiger-snake he lit, a foot below its head,
And thrice it bit the leg of P. O’Reilly.
When Patrick finished cursing in his loud, emphatic
way,
111 bring you, said the Boss, “to Doctor Keilly ;
Put on your hat and coat, man, and I’ll run you into
Hay.”
Said Pat: “Run out some whisky, for ’tis here I
mean to stay.
I’ll see you burnt and roasted ere I leave the hut
to-day.
A fig for all your snakebites!” said O’Reilly.
“Gorstrike me pink and purple! Do you take me for
a fool?
I’m ’noculated, Boss,” said Paddy, slyly;
“I carry in my carcase of the grog of Carathool
An antidote for all-the snakes from here to Mumble-
dool.”
O'Reilly went on cooking. ’Twixt the barracks and
the school
We found it, dead—the snake that bit O’Reilly.

BEAUTY DOCTOR TELLS
SECRET.
Beauty Doctor Gives Simple Recipe to
Darken Grey Hair and Promote Its
Growth.
Miss Alice Whitney, a well-known beauty
doctor, recently gave out the following
statement: “Anyone can prepare a simple
mixture at home, at very little cost, that
will darken grey hair, promote its growth
and make it soft and glossy. To a half-pint
of water add loz. of bay rum, a small box
of Orlex Compound and }oz. of glycerine.
These ingredients can be bought at any
chemist’s at very little cost. Apply to the
hair twice a week until the desired shade is
obtained. This will make a grey-haired per-
son look 20 years younger. It is also fine
to promote the growth of the hair, relieve
itching and scalp disease, and is excellent
for dandruff and falling hair.” [G

"1\ .C.M.” : In the limber section I intend
entering what in the Braidwood (N.S.W.) district is
called mountain-ash. It is as hard as a Hun's heart,
will turn the edge of any axe if hit across the grain,
and is used for mauls. It is also the best fuel I ever
’•aised steam with. From the leaves is distilled an
essential oil, which ranks high in the making of
perfumes. The vegetable is one of the tall variety ;
shafts of SOft. to the first branch are common. The
leaves, grow in bunches at the end of the branches.
The under side of the leaf is red, and seen on a
windy day the trees are as handsome as any other.
The wood polishes l etter than blackwood, having
much the same color and grain, but its hairiness keeps
it out of the cabinet-maker’s shop.
“F.11.R. : lie keeping mice from hay-
stacks, grain, flour, etc. Use sulphur. Sprinkle it
over the bags or about the stack, and you will find
the rodents give it as wide a berth as the teetotaller
gives “colonial wallop.”
GARDENING FOR AMATEURS.
“Rag” : They’re pretty casual about their
duffing in the Gulf country. I was a passenger once
per buckboard between tiie Einasleigh and Kidston,
when we happened on to a mob of springers grazing
unattended. We pulled up, and I was handed the
reins while the proprietor of the vehicle got close to
the beasts with his rifle. When he beckoned me to
drive up 2cwt. of young bullock lay dead. The
brigand cut the brand out and shredded it to bits,
skinned the carcase, cut out what meat he wanted,
rubbed salt and sugar into it, shoved it into coarse
sacks, and resumed the voyage.
WELL KNOWN.
DRUNK (apologetically): “ You’re not (hie) angry wi' me, parshon?"
PARSON (calmly): “No, Jones, not angry—sorry. We must remember there has only
been one perfect man in this wor” -
DRUNK (sadly): “Yesh, I know. I'll (hie) hear of him when Ig’ ’ome. Always
do. He (hie) was m' wifsh’s first husban’ !”
“McKais”: If “Sammy” lias found no good
in any of the recipes offered him for his acroplaning
horse let him take a piece of sapling about an inch
shorter than the hobble-chain and hitch it along the
chain. That 11 stop any kangarooing-, because a horse
when about to spring places his front paws together,
and he can't do it when the piece of timber is in
the way.
“To Babarantiko”: “Lagani-Namo” (B.
2-///’ln) helps to throw some unnecessary mud in
connection with the murder of Mae Kay,
of Lindenhafen, New Britain. Mac know
well enough the danger of touching at the
village where he was killed. In addition,
he had been warned. Why lie anchored
nobody but himself will ever know. Any-
how, three of the niggers implicated
have paid the penalty for the job—one
of them the leader. The reason for the
killing seems to have been just “general
principles.” The nigger lives up to his
convictions, as a rule. He knows what
he wants and goes after it with charming-
directness. Usually he pays for his fun,
too. To do him justice, he doesn’t mind.
A lady of New Guinea, arrested in con-
nection with the killing- of Mae Kay, gave
three different reasons for it. (1) Some
white man once upon a time stole a pig
frotn the village, and it seemed a fair
thing that it should be paid for. (2)
They did not like white men. (3) They
had never “had” a white man, so could
not afford to miss the opportunity. Reasons enough,
you see. Each one, from the niggers’ point of view,
a casus belli.
* * * *
“Cross Roads” : Any experienced horseman
who tames the wild brumby uses the smallest enclo-
sure .possible. Harry Dempsey, father of Dempsey
brothers, mentioned by “Barrier” (B. 19/S/’10), has
had the brumby in the open without a bridle, but I’ll
wager if his advice was asked in the matter he would
say: “The small yard, sonny, every time.” If any-
body knows more about the game than Dempsey, it's
his next talk.
“Flinclerino”: “Rag’s” encounter with a
native cat in a vermin trap (B. 12/8/’l5) reminds
me of Jimmy Ah Ling, licensed fisherman, of Trinity
Inlet (N.Q.). One evening Ah Ling navigated his
flatty up to his fish-trap near Blackfellows’ Creek, and
made fast to one of the ti-tree uprights. The fall-
ing tide was still 3ft. deep in the trap, so the
Chinkie discarded his slacks and climbed into the
enclosure to gather the fish. Then the excitement
commenced. Ah Ling trod on something which
straightway threw a back handspring and snapped at
him like a steam bulldog. Simultaneously Ah Ling
let out a Foochoo yell and turned a double-somer-
sault. The cause of his indisposition was an ener-
getic crocodile, and although it was less than a yard
long it made strenuous efforts to swallow the China-
man whole. In the rough-and-tumble, the trap partly
collapsed and the flatty broke adrift. Then the
crocogator and the other live stock made their escape.
Ah Ling, trouserless and boatless, was left hanging
on to the top ends of the trap sticks, and was nearly
eaten by mosquitoes and sandflies before he was found
and rescued. Since then he takes extreme precautions
with a long pole before entering a submerged trap.

“Umnma”: Meandering round the Louis-
indes Archipelago 1 met the Dead Finish in beach-
combers. We talked about the war, of course, and
•he gave me some news about the invasion of England
by J. Caesar. What I couldn’t make out was his re-
peated reference to Clara Patrick. “Wot!” lie ex-
claimed in astonishment when I confessed my ignor-
ance. “Nivver ’card of Clara Patrick ! Wlioi, they’ve
got a moniment to her needle in London if the
blarsted Germans haven’t bust it up.” Which recalls
a well-known Australian sport who had trouble with
his sons. “Gorstruth,” he exclaimed to his solicitor,
“it’s enough to make Mary McDillon turn in her
grave.” “Mary McDillon?” said the attorney, “Mary
McDillon?” “Yes, yes,” said the sport; “you know
—the'woman in the Bible.”
“Moana” : The sparrow pest is well and
hearty in Maoriland. On a farm at Selwyn recently
seven guns were fired simultaneously into ' a mass
meeting, and the casualties numbered 228. Unfor-
tunately the name of the niutton-head who imported
the sparrow into M.L. was not in the list of killed.
John Maori wanted an interview with the
agent:—■

there for we sen you this letter Any way write and

way give us a look in

HENARE PURETAPI.
“Devilfish” : The sassafras is one of those
Australian plants whose economic value is practically
unknown except to a few bushmen. There are people
in the backblocks of Tasmania, who use sassafras
“tea” and thrive upon it. A decoction made from
the bark is a fine tonic, and is said to cure toothache
and neuralgia. If the sassafras grew in Peru or
Cochin-China instead of right at our doors we would
import the bark in vast quantities for medicinal
purposes.
A FALSE ALARM.
Recognising the fodder value of kurrajong,
eorob, saltbush and several other indigenous vege-
tables in droughty places, Ashford, Minister for Lands
(N.S.W.), will supply landholders with seedlings of
these fodder plants, gratis. To induce the man on
the land to avail himself of this assistance £l5O will
be distributed among those obtaining the best results
with the seedlings ; and portions of the State farms
are to be set aside for the experimental cultivation of
these native herbs.

M‘GEE and the giraffe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My friend M'Gee, from Bungaree,
I trotted to the Zoo,
The lumbering elephant to see,
The growling tiger, too ;
The lion of gigantic size
He looked upon with small surprise.
The buffalo he seemed to know;
For deer he didn’t care;
And no concern he cared to show
Before the Polar bear ;
But how he snorted through his nose
When high the wild giraffe arose!
A weird surmise was in his eyes.
“Begor!” I heard him say.
(His wonder he did not disguise—•
He would not come away.)
“I’ll wait to see how the galoot
Climbs up that high to feed the brute!”

A right up-to-the-minute request was
made by a juryman during a murder trial
in Hobart recently. Being informed that
as the case could not finish they would be
locked up for the night, one arose and
asked if his Honor would allow them to go
to “the pictures” under strong escort! His
’Onali said he’d be dashed if he would, or
something like that.
The “smalls” of Australia are to have a
round of calls from an entertaining co.
headed by Australia’s old friends Spada and
Philip Newbury, the Ilaymans (late of
London), and the Waldrons. N. S. Wales
first, starting in the West this month;
Queensland to follow.
“C. Ockney” : It is unfortunately true, as
“Ho Ho” points out (B. 19/8/T5), that
“the English language is rarely heard in
Australian playhouses now.” But I don’t
think the managements are blamable. The
English drama was dead long before the
war, and by latest reports it is still dead
and likely to remain so. Hence there seems
no prospect of any new British plays being-
staged here. During the last London season
few productions lasted longer than a fort-
night—or three weeks at the outside. Even
well-equipped play-concoctors like Knob-
lauch, Macdonald Hastings, James M.
Barrie and Stephen Phillips “fell down.”
Here are a few of the recent runs at
West End theatres: “Wild Thyme,” at the
Comedy, with Seymour Hicks in the lead,
three weeks; the piece which succeeded it,
“Mr. and Mrs. Ponsonby,” only totalled
eight performances; “The Laughter of
Fools” (Prince of Wales’), 25 perform-
ances; “The Road to Raebury” (Criterion),
11 performances; “Marie Odile” (Her
Majesty’s). 30 performances. Although
Beerbohm Tree produced this last in his best
manner, and in spite of his not appearing
in it himself, it failed dismally. Tree is
now in “the halls” doing a condensed version
of “Trilby” twice nightly. He finds these
starring engagements at a fat salary very
useful. The two biggest successes in Lon-
don are “Peg o' My Heart” and “Potash and
Perlmutter.” The former has been running
since last October and the latter since last
April twelvemonth! Both are American
plays.
“De Oriel”: Sorry to call “Barcoo” fB.
12/8/T5) a German plenipotentiary, but
Earl’s Court, Rockhampton, is not the larg-
est open-air picture-show place in Australia,
nor even Bananaland’s biggest. Olympia, at
Ipswich (Q.), fills the bill. It can hold the
whole local population and half their sins
at once.
Clara Butt is accumulating new experi-
ences. In last month’s production of “Peter
Ibbetson” —dramatised from Du Manner's
Anglo-Parisian story by J. N. Raphael, an
Ar.glo-Parisian himself —she appeared on the
stage for the first time in a speaking part.
Just before, she had gone on to sing in the
big “Henry VIII.” patriotic performance.
Naturally, she had to dress for the period ;
and that was her first appearance on any
stage in “costume.”
“Snell’': Consider tlie morals of “The Law
of the Land.” The hero and heroine are
firstly adulterers, secondly murderers, and
the ethical aim, so far as Broadliurst has
any aim beyond dollars, is to screen this
precious pair from the consequences of their
iniquity. The husband in the case is the
abandoned villain, because, being a deceived
husband with another man’s child foisted
upon him, he does not preserve the amenities,
curse him! The wife is a wanton and a
murderess without compunction, but she is
quiet with it, and wears pretty frocks,
whereas the husband is a plain man with a
nasty temper. The moral is that a plain
husband deserves all he gets if he doesn’t
take it kindly. It serves him right for being
a heroine’s husband, anyway.
“Floater” : They tried a Jap soprano for
the first time in the name part of “Madame
Butterfly” on the recent revival at London
Opera House. The lady’s name is Tamaki
Miura, and one critic gushes that “her act-
ing—a delightful blend of naivete and
tragedy —and her voice, with its quaint,
Occidental quality, quite won over her audi-
ence.”
“Norbell”: The late Dan Barry always
wore black gloves when playing Uncle Tom.
to save the bother of dirtying his hands with
burnt cork. One night in Bendigo he
whipped out between scenes to swallow an
inspiration, and forgot to put his gloves on
when he came back. lie was just in time
for Little Eva’s death, and kneeling rever-
ently at her bedside he raised his hands to
Heaven in pious grief, whilst all the as-
sembled niggers wailed “Sweet By-an’-Bye.”
Presently Dan wondered what the house
was giggling about, and then he caught sight
of his hands. Quite equal to the occasion
Dan exclaimed : “Praise de good Lord ! A
miracle ! A miracle ! Bress de Lord ! Ali’m
turnin’ white !”
“S.T.S.”: The overpowdered stage lady
(B. 22/7/’l5) is no new vision. I remem-
ber Toole long ago burlesquing “Fedora” in
a thing labelled “Stage-Doora.” After the
passionate love-scene, the old comedian used
to withdraw from the heroine’s embrace, and
silently but emphatically use a clothes-brush
all over his shoulders and breast.
“Moana”: “Floater’s” remarks (P>.
5/8/T5) regarding Pqul Hester’s new com-
edy. “Beverley’s Balance,” now beginning
to look' like a real success in the U.S.A.,
reminds me that the writer of this rather
slight plav owes a lot to Australia’s old
friend Margaret Anglin. Margaret usually
sniffs at mere comedy, but she was tempted
into the cast on this occasion by the witty
and distinctly clever dialogue which propels
the piece. The play is really a satirical
farce, very different from some of the
American comedies dished up in these parts
lately.
“Archdeacon Bluegum”: The swamping
of Australia with cheap-jack U.S.A. canned
drama has driven me and a large part of my
congregation out of the picture-shows. For
a couple of years or more cino.-men have
protested to me that the public demands the
kind of photo-drama that Uncle Flam pro-
duces. and that “scenic” films will not go.
I’m busy now hunting for those alleged
authorities. Last week the long scenic film.
“London by Day and Night,” .was unwound
at Sydney Lyceum, and ran at least twice
daily. It was advertised as the attrac-
tion, and it drew exhilarating business.
I saw it from various parts of the
house on divers occasions, believing, as
I do, that the Hun has still some-
thing up his Zeppelin, and that there
may be violent alterations in the old historic
town. Each time I was in the theatre people
before me, behind me, and on each side of
me gave the extra-glad hand to that “scenic,”
and any back-number showman who tells me
again that “that sort of thing is dead” does
so at the risk of being invited to try his
hand at the bottle-o business.
“Ami”: Harrie Ireland’s rheumatic
affliction reminds me of Rosalie Duvalli,
similarly punished and very likely from a
similar cause. Rosalie had to give up as a
dancer through rheumatism contracted by
performing in a British theatre which was
too new and damp-. Managerial greed thus
spoilt a graceful performer. But Australia
gained in one way, because the lady settled
down in Melbourne and taught other people
how to be less like their great-grandfather
apes.
“Ivaniva” : Mention of Pierre Bellew 18.
12/8/T5) as representing Napoleon in the
French Day pageant at Melbourne recalls
that his mother was Eugenie Legrand, lead-
ing lady to Boothroyd Fairclough, that more
than passable tragedian who opened at the
Theatre Royal (Melb.) in 1573 in Hamlet.
Eugenie was Ophelia, but her French tongue
tripped over many an English word.
“Monkbarns”: “More study!” moans the
despairing actor nowadays, if he lias one
new part in a month. Experience is sup-
posed to be gained when the tyro plays a
part of a few lines in a run of a whole year.
Harwood and Cathcart compared the enor-
mous number of characters they had acted.
Each did not drop far short of a thousand.
Harwood had acted every part in “Hamlet”
except Hamlet, and Cathcart every one
except the two clowns. Irving and Ban-
croft each acted over 400 parts before
emerging into much notice. A coun-
try stock actor might have half a dozen new
parts to master in a week. Heavy work
every day with double tides on Sunday. Then
look at what work meant even for those well
up the ladder. In London the performances
lasted five hours, from seven till 12, and
for a benefit it might be one a.m.! Walter
Lacy relates how that for 00 nights running,
at the London Princess’s, under Charles
Kean, he acted Rouble, an important char-
acter in the two-act comedy of “The Prima
Donna,” followed by Chateau Renaud, chief
villain in the three-act “Corsican Brothers,”
ending with Highflier, principal light
comedian in the two-act comedy, “A Roland
for an Oliver.”
“S.S.”: This is the story told to me by
the barman. “He was in here yesterdee.
He ain’t actin’ nowhere now. He was takin’
a stout, when a shiclter sez to him, ‘ ’Ellow.
ole long-wool!’ he says, ‘ain’t you goin’ to
the Front?’ Me noble the act-or man looks
him over. ‘Coin’ to the Front?’ sez he. ‘My
son, I came to the front before you were
born.’ ”
THE VOICE OF BROWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Brown gets the foolish fancy
When we with wine rejoice,
And many drinks have vanished,
That he has got a Voice.
He’s likely then to christen,
While scoffing strangers smile,
A fat-and-forty barmaid
His Mary of Argyle.
We do not mention singing
Before him, as a rule;
For that is simple folly.
Blit Smithers is a fool.
He mentioned Tipperary,
And promptly Brown upsprang
And, in a lusty manner,
The famous ditty sang.
The publican said bluntly,
That he admired the voice,
But there could be no singing—
The Law allowed no choice.
That settled Brown—he vanished,
But presently was seen
To a policeman singing
The “Wearin’ of the Green.”
The Robert urged us, mildly,
To lead him out of view.
“Oi cud,” said he, “arrist him;
But Oi am Oirish, too.”
We did not wait to question •
The Irish blood of Brown,
But seized the raging singer
And trammed him out of town.
He sang the wild conductor
A song of the unfed,
In plaintive notes, requesting
A penny for some bread.
Then other songs he sampled
Till people made a fuss.
But, as we argued matters,
He left the tram and us.
We found him on a corner
Still singing this and that,
While some sly, ragged loafer
Was taking round the hat.
He swore Brown was his partner
With* angry oaths and shrill ;
But in a cab we bundled
Old Brown; and, singing still,
We drove him home. Together
We bore him to his door ;
But there he struggled from us
And burst in song once more.
It was a song of parting:
He called his wife the Maid
Of Athens. ’Twas intended
As a last serenade.
’Twas then we parted from him;
In haste we fled for town,
And only heard the water
That shortly fell on Brown!

INFLUENZA
“No one who has not had Influenza can realise the suffering it causes or
how it defies treatment—hut I know of nothing that will give such prompt relief as Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy. When it is taken the pain in the chest disappears, the fever subsides and the whole
body becomes more comfortable. Though the after effects of Influenza are often more distressing than
the disease itself, they too can be avoided by taking Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy. The greatest
danger from this disease is Pneumonia but I’ve never known a single case to result in it when

There are many
reasons why you
should get rid of
all that EXCESS
FAT
Excess fat injures your health, impedes your move-
ments, and makes you the joke-butt of your unfeeling
normal-weight friends. People who are excessively
fat never feel well and vigorous like normal folks. You know this is true.
People who have been fat and are now reduced to normal, think other fat people
ridiculous. Excess fat, also, impedes the heart action, rendering its functions
difficult, and interferes with the breathing. Not alone does excess fat injure your
health and endanger your existence, it absolutely destroys your figure and makes
you a ludicrous sight. Why do you stay over fat?
"TI-SARK.IN”
positively removes excess fat
and will restore your spoiled
figure to genteel and pleasing proportions, and is always a sure and lasting cure
for obesity and corpulency. A few doses improves your breathing wonderfully, and
the course of treatment will cure you. It. is the only successful and at the same
time harmless fat-reducer that has ever been discovered. Its efficacy has been
undeniably demonstrated in thousands of successfully treated cases. It is totally
and absolutely non-poisonous, and can in no wise work any injury to the general
health, even though it often reduces excess weight by as much as a pound a day.
On the contrary, improved conditions in the general health become noticeable in less
than a week after its use is begun. Guarantee given

Dear Sir, —When I wrote you in July last my niece
was rapidly improving under your treatment. She was
then over 15 stone in weight, but has since been reduced
to truly genteel proportions, and is now a very pleasing
figure. She continued. her usual diet while under treat-
ment and was in no way inconvenienced, and I am
truly grateful to you for the result, for before the
treatment she was absolutely devoid of any semblance
of a figure, a burden to herself and friends, anti un-
happy generally. She has reduced considerably over
three stone, and her health has improved to a splendid
extent. —Yours respectfully. M. Clt A MB.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them ‘“Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

The cable says that Frank, a U.S.A.
factory-owner who was accused of murder-
ing one of his girl employees, has been
dragged by a howling mob from the hands
•of the Law and suspended from a tree.
So Uncle Sam, who is too proud to fight,
proves that he still isn’t too stuck up to
lynch.
The Asquith Government has been reduced
to the humiliating necessity of explaining
that the Baron Schroeder job was a fraud
on the public. Schroeder was “naturalised”
in London as soon as the war broke out. not
because he had pretensions to loyalty, but
because his internment would have caused
financial trouble in the city. He practically
forced the Government to let him go through
the “naturalisation” farce, though he was
notoriously anti-British and his son was a
German officer. Moral: Don’t let an un-
naturalised alien get into a position where
the Government can’t afford to treat him as
the enemy he is when the Government de-
clares war against his fatherland.
“Understudy” has a suggestion:—
If Pearce will hand me his job for two or three
minutes I’ll make an order to the effect that every
volunteer who presents himself shall be forthwith
■examined, lock, stock and barrel. I volunteered and
passed the doctor in Ballarat. Arrived in Melbourne,
after burning my boats, I was there promptly chucked
•out. I wanted an inch of chest, and spent a month
getting it. Then the Department lowered the stan-
dard two inches, so I passed with two to spare and
was chucked out a minute later for having heart
trouble. Leaving out the Ballarat examination, on
the face of it farcical, I wasted a month, and was
examined twice. Had the first test been thorough I
need not have wasted the month, or as much of the
time of doctors, dentists, clerks, etc., as the second
exam, entailed.
Nothing particular happened at the muni-
cipal elections in Victoria. The Mayor of
Prahran, one Heyward, was pushed out in
favor of solicitor D. S. Abraham, a Toorak-
dweller of some distinction. Lately Hey-
ward made a few brusque remarks about
the unemployed, choosing a patriotic meet-
ing for the utterance, and those remarks
came back and slew him. Prahran also lost
T. G. L. Scott, one of the military censors,
beaten by Alfred Woodfull, a solicitor.
“Tommy” Carroll, a Board of Works Com-
missioner and 22 years in the Malvern
Council, was assisted out of his seat by
draper Darroch; and the ancient Edward
Dillon, who had been 48 years in the Cam-
berwell collection, fell before the attack of
one Arthur Willison. They say it will kill
Dillon.
“Carmine’s” art note : —-
McCubbin has been lecturing in Melbourne on Aus-
tralian Art. The early painters strove for the
grand rather than the homely. Witness Chevalier’s
“Buffalo Mountains” and Guerard’s “Kosciusko” and
“Mitta Mitta,” alien to Austral environment. Buvelot
was a forerunner of the present, with typical bush
scenes like his “Summer Eve at Templestowe,”
wherein one can find hints of the charm of Corot
and the Barbizon school. Native-boni artists worked
in the open, instead of in the studio. Withers settled
in Heidelberg. Note the result in his Tranquil
Winter.” Buvelot revelled in the hot summer even-
ing ; Davies in the subtle twilight mystery; Streeton
in the startling brilliance of summer noon. Of course
McCubbin made generous reference to Longstaff, Fox,
Paterson, Mather and others, and equally of course
did not refer at all to his own eminently creditable
output.
A noise has been made in IVestralia over
what is styled “the Wyndham secret con-
tract.” Some time ago Scaddan made a
very sudden bargain with a firm to build
freezing and water-supply works at Wynd-
ham, in the far nor’-west, for £155,150, or
about £45,000 less than the official estimate.
The contractors brought material from
Europe and elsewhere and sent a gang of
men up with a boss. On arrival the boss
decided that the work couldn’t be done for
the money, and threw up his job. A little
later the Government began to feel uneasy,
and finally induced the firm to cancel the
contract and accept £7844 for commission
on purchased material and cost of plans.
The Opposition twitted the Ministry about
the deal when Parliament met, and “Mulga”
Taylor, who breaks out occasionally, gave
tile Government a shock by moving from the
Ministerial side what was tantamount to
a no-confidence motion. Caucus then got
t 0 W ork, and when the House next met the
mo t; on lapsed. But the Opposition is now
taking a hand, and if it gets the undivided
support of the Country party (which is
doubtful ) it may push the Government out.
gcaddan says he took the tiling over because
there was a grave doubt about the firm’s
ability to complete the contract in anywhere
near the specified time; also there were
legal difficulties. The real reason, however,
is said to have been labor umons objection
the contract sys tem and the importation
men bo do the work when there were
plenty unemployed in the State. Compen-
sation was given because there was a legi-
«|
p Urc h a sed in London and transferred
g ta t e W as now valued at £13,000
more than the invoice price. On paper the
deal doesn’t, from the State’s standpoint,
look a bad one at all. If the Government
£ .SST,
wou tj have been involved in costly litiga-
tion, and would certainly have had to pay
for the plans.

A
Special
Appeal
Mother and Child.
Baby 6% months.
Fed from birth on the ‘Altenburys' Foods.
on Behalf of Baby
Naturally a Healthy Mother
should feed her own child, and no cause, save inability,
should prevent her doing so. But there are many
mothers who, though willing, cannot wholly or even
partially, nurse their children. Either they have no
milk for them, or it is poor in quality and deficient
in sustenance.
The Question then arises
what food should be given to Baby. Carefully consider
this highly important point. Remember, that the
right food, given at the proper age will lay a sure
foundation for future health and happiness. Ordinary
cow’s milk is totally unsuitable as a food for young
infants; it is acid, contains indigestible curd and is
frequently swarming with dangerous germs, especially
in summer time. F arinaceous F ood s must not be given, as
a child under seven months of age cannot digest starch.
A Satisfactory Solution
of the difficult problem of feeding children by hand is
provided by using the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. Prepared
as directed, these pure Foods closely resemble healthy
mother’s milk in composition, nutritive value and
digestibility. They are the outcome of prolonged
scientific investigation, carried out with all the resources
of wide manufacturing facilities and experience.
Decide to use
the ‘Allenburys’ Foods. By so doing the many serious
ailments which folllow the use of unsuitable food will
be avoided, and Baby will be equipped with sound
health and strength.

are all due to germs. The risk of attack
may be reduced to a minimum by the use of
Beau's Essence, either as a gargle or taken
inwardly. It is a fine mouth and throat
disinfectant, and a great healer of inflamed
mucous membrane, which, if left unattended
to, renders the human system particularly
susceptible to bacterial infection. Because
of its germ-combating, membrane-healing,
tonic and expectorant properties, Bean’s
Essence has no superior as a household
remedy for colds, influenza, whooping cough,
coughs due to measles, bronchitis, sore,
inflamed throats, etc. Besides being such a
wonderfully good medicine, it is a great
money saver. A bottle costing 2/- makes a
pint of ready-to-use mixture —as much as
you can get for 12/- of ordinary cough mix-
tures. The cash saving is therefore quite
10/- There is certainly nothing which gives
quicker relief. Bean’s Essence is obtain-
able from chemists and stores everywhere,
or by post for 2/-, from G. W. " Bean,
chemist, ITS Castlereagh Street, Sydney;
Box 531, G.P.0., Melbourne; Box 131,
G.P.Q., Brisbane; or Bean’s Pharmacy,
Wanganui, N.Z.*
CASTOR-OIL, SALTS & DRUGS REPLACED
BY “CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.”
Delicious “fruit laxative” cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels of old
and young folks.
A delicious cure for constipation, bilious-
ness, sick headache, disordered stomach, indi-
gestion, coated tongue, sallowness —take
“California Syrup of Figs.” For the cause
of all this distress lies in a toripd liver and
sluggish bowels.
A tablespoonful to-night means all consti-
pation poison, waste matter, fermenting food
and bile gently moved out of your system by
morning without griping. Please don’t think
of “California Syrup of Figs” as a physic.
Don’t think you are drugging yourself or
your children. This delicious fruit laxative
cannot cause injury. Even a delicate child
can take it as safely as a robust man. It
is the most harmless, effective stomach, liver
and bowel regulator and tonic ever devised.
Ask your chemist for a bottle of “Cali-
fornia Syrup of Figs,” which has full direc-
tions for babies, children of all ages and for
grown-ups plainly printed on the bottle.
Beware of counterfeits sold here. Get the
genuine, made by “California Fig Syrup
Company.” Refuse any other kind with
contempt. “California Syrup of Figs” is
sold by all leading chemists, and 1/9.
BILIOUS HEADACHES.
“I found Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
afford me much relief from distressing bilious
headaches,” writes Mrs. .7. F. Heath, of
Warialda Street, East Morce, N.S.W. “I
think my case would be hard tp eclipse, so
bad did I suffer with severe bilious attacks
and throbbing 'headaches. After taking
almost every medicine I found Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills very beneficial as u
remedy for biliousness. I have now resided
in this township sixteen years, and fre-
quently recommend your medicine to un-
friends, as I know it to be a reliable
remedy. You can give publicity to this
statement.”*
Messrs. Finney, Isles and Co., Limited, “The
Drapers of Queensland,” have issued their new season
fashion book, and it is now being' posted to their out-
of-town friends. This authentic fashion book will
probably be of greater value this season than any of
its predecessors, as during the winter great changes
have taken place in the fashion world. Styles that
were perfectly correct a few months back no longer
reign. The pretty feminine frilly frocks of 1850 are
all showing in this very complete book. The compil-
ing has been very carefully planned and carried out
with the sole object of making mail-order shopping-
simple and easy. The book is an encyclopaedia of all the
newest in millinery, costumes, coats, underwear, chi I
dren’s wear, dress goods, furnishing, men’s and boys’
wants, furniture and household goods generally.
Fashion Guide will be posted free to anyone out of
town taking the trouble to send their" name and

POLITICAL
POINTS
What absurdities the voluntary Defence
system flogs us into! So eager are we to
push and bribe men to do their duty that the
other day the N. S. Wales Full Court allowed
the application of a lawyer’s articled clerk
that service as a member of the Expedition-
ary Force should be counted as service under
his articles of clerkship! On the same prin-
ciple, supposing the war lasted five years
and a man served in it all the time, he ought
on his return to have the right to say what
trade or profession he chose by virtue of his
service. Five years’ soldiering would thus
qualify a man to practise as undertaker, doc-
tor, lawyer or plumber.
THE UNREWARDED CHAPE.
THE HUN: “Vot vos the better cef I chase
him lint I don’t catch him?”
“Leo I.cars'’ tale of another permanent
and reproductive job :
The drought has left one peculiar monument in
Western Victoria in the shape of a windmill whose
head now stands or floats about four feet above water
in Lake Condah. This lake was formerly one of the
Cabbage Garden’s few fresh-water inland seas, but
being regarded as an incubus —though it covered less
land than many stations would fence for a weaning
paddock—some of Bull’s superfluous cash was used
to bail and drain it, and its dry bed was leased for
a sheep-run. The mill was then erected to pump
water. Since the drought collapsed this part of Vic-
toria has been deluged with torrents unequalled for
decades. Consequently Condah defied the Government
and its puny drains, rose to its old level, swamped
Bull’s £ s. d., and left the mill pathetically waving
its arm for help above the flood.
The Germans are “experimenting with a
giant aviatili” which is “even noisier than
the Zeppelin.” This is a characteristic tri-
umph. Modern German science is all noises
and stinks, and the Hun who couples a
horrifying noise and a suffocating stink will
be acclaimed the inventor of a masterpiece.
The annoying part of it is that, when the
world is quiet again, their own infernal
noises will have made them so deaf that
they will be unable to hear the blistering
comments of posterity.
“Mujik": How can the “Never Again”
brigade expect to be taken seriously when
they talk of their fierce determination to
encourage Australian industry and simul-
taneously turn it down? At a recent official
feast in Sydney foreign wine helped the
tucker along, while 17 speakers blithered
that “every pound kept in Australia is a
golden prop to our national solvency.”
Meanwhile it is announced by the Common-
wealth’s commercial agent at. Capetown that
a good market is offering for Australian
champagne in South Africa. So things may
be evened up on the lines dear to the foreign-
trader’s soul by Australia dragging bottles
from the other end of the globe and sending
other bottles on a long, wet journey.
The Tasmanian Government is mortally
afraid that the recruiting movement may
end in some of its departments being manned
only by the old ladies at the top of the tree
and the young ladies who do the typing.
Consequently all State servants have been
forbidden to enlist without special permis-
sion, and a good many who have asked for
leave to go have been refused it. One war-
rior-clerk in the Health Department reached
camp in spite of all precautions, and had
been there over a week before he was missed
and hauled back to his stool. It is so much
more important that his stool should be kepi
warm than that the Empire should stand up.
The \\ estralian Labor Government has
introduced a Bill which will not do Mr.
Bung any good. The measure divides the
State into four districts —Metropolitan.
Goldfields, Agricultural and Nor’-West-
and provides for a referendum to be taken
in each. Each district will decide the hour
at which its hotels and clubs shall shut
down on liquor. Ballot papers xvill afford
an opportunity of voting for closure at any
hour between six and 11 p.m. If six o’clock
closing is ruled out the votes for that
hour will be transferred to seven, and so
on, as in the recent S. Australian poll.
Lessees of hotels and members of clubs are
to be entitled to the return from their land-
lords of an amount of rent proportioned to
the number of hours by which their trading
time is curtailed; and when in the case of
pubs a premium has been paid by the tenant,
a similar proportion must be refunded. The
Bill is certain to pass the Assembly, but it is
probable that clubs will be exempted by the
Council. The only other remote possibility
is that the Bill may be rejected by the Coun-
cil on the ground that if a referendum is taken
at all the State should vote as one and not
by districts. Meanwhile the Government is
being righteously taunted by the Opposition
with having introduced the Bill in order to
rid itself of the responsibility of enforcing
the Act of 1914.. which provides for the shut-
ting of pubs and clubs at 9 p.m. during war-
time.
No man interprets the good gospel
that the laborer is worthy of his hire quite
so clearly as the Australian.
Arrangements were made re-
cently to billet return wounded
on the hospitality of private
Melbourne homes. But when
the scheme was explained to
Gallipoli Bill, he replied defin-
itely that he couldn’t consider it
unless the Government contrib-
uted the cost of his keep. If
the Government wouldn’t do
that, then he preferred to stay
in the hospital or rest-home. It
meant, as clearly as Bill could
say it. that he didn’t believe in
voluntary service—that con-
scription was the only fair
thing, everybody paying his whack towards
the maintenance of the crippled Kangaroo.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Hall got his nose
badly pinched in the door when lie dashed off
those frantic orders of his for Yankee butter.
Uncle Sam, who at the best is a wretched
butter maker, unloaded on him thousands of
boxes of grease so vile that even a butter-
starved Sydney turned up its nose at it.
Hall is now warily sending 4000 boxes of the
awful stuff on another sea-trip, in the hope
that John Bull or Senegal or somebody won’t
be so particular. He reckons the loss may
be kept within reasonable limits if the con-
signment brings £lO a ton more than the
choicest Danish. But as it will certainly go
at job-lot rates, a sadder and chastened
Hall is busy changing the conversation.
What with his wheat losses and butter
calamities and disturbances over the Aus-
tralian pig, the Attorney-General is having
strenuous times. It is wonderful what a
man can miss knowing about wheat and but-
ter and bacon deals by studying the law.
Tories all over Australia have swal-
lowed their principles pretty effectively
as regards the Maternity Bonus. When
Fisher brought the idea forward mem-
bers of the Women’s Gnashonal League,
“Mother of Ten,” and others con-
demned it as an Insult to True Woman-
hood, and announced that they would sooner
die than accept the shameful “liver.” Offi-
cial figures, however, show that practically
every woman in the Commonwealth, no
matter how lofty her principles or how
bloated her banking account, who gave birth
to a child last year, went to the. further
trouble of filling in the forms necessary to
obtain the bonus. In 1913 the number of
claims allowed (135,667) was only 47
below the births (1.31,714) ; while last year
THE CRUELTY OF BRITISH SEA POWER.
HERR DOCTOR : "Your Majesty is much run down. You need a sea voyage.”
THE KAISER (bitterly): "I ere can I go—He Aquarium?”
the claims allowed (139.119) actually ex-
ceeded the births (137.983) by 1176. This
anomaly is accounted for by the fact that
about 3000 allowances are paid annually
in respect to still-born infants not included
in the total number of birth registrations;
while against this is to be set the fact that
only one bonus is paid for twins or triplets,
of which multiple births there were, for
instance. 1350 in 1912. Put the main fact
which official figures establish beyond dis-
pute is that claims are made in respect to
practically 100 per cent, of the little immi-
grants.
From an entirely untrustworthy source : —•
Thank Heaven, the sovereign authority reserved to
the Australian State* is not limited to prohibiting
pig and butter and cliickwheat going over the
borders; they can also prohibit things coming in-
wards ! Consequently the X. S. Wales Government,
in exercise of its powers of eminent domain, is ready
with a proclamation that no boots, clothing or
machinery shall be allowed to cross the Murray north-
wards. This will, fix those Federal Parliamentarians
who think they have authority to do anything more
than borrow money.
When Vic. Opposition-leader Elmslie
ousted Watt two years ago, and held office
for a week with the grudging aid of the
Corner, he got in ahead of Corner-leader
McLeod by about 10 minutes. Last week
he took less risk, firing a shot immediately
the House assembled, while Oman, McLeod
and Johnston were hurrying up Bourke-
street and McKenzie was reading in the
library. Of course the whole thing is farce.
Under the ridiculous party system Elmslie
cannot beat the Government without the aid
of the Corner, and if he got the Corner’s
aid he could not rely on it for five minutes.
Meanwhile, when you consider the mass of
useful work waiting to be done—which an
elective Government, not bound by party
ties, would probably make an effort to do —-
compared with the tons of work which the
Peacock team has energetically left undone,
there seems niucli excuse for John
Weary’s plea that Parliament might as well
shut up till the war is over. But when you
come to think of it, what a shocking admis-
sion it is for a Minister to make!
Thus N.S.W. Governor Strickland, at the
Sydney “Fair” which is intended to show
the way to “capture the enemy’s trade”: —
It was a pleasant coincidence that the president
of the Chamber of Commerce (G. A. Parkes) bore the
name of a great Australian statesman, who was r
markable for his foresight.
A great Australian statesman named Parkes
who was remarkable for his foresight? There
certainly was a Premier named Parkes; but
lie was the boss Foreign-trader of his time;
and his lack of foresight helped to make this
“Trade Fair” necessary. Surely Strickland
wasn’t referring to that Parkes as a plea-
sant coincidence! If he was, then we could
get equal misinformation on important sub-
jects for much less money than his Ex. costs
us.
"Shicla”: From Hansard for August 20:
Senator Milieu: Victim'* were exhibited in the
Chamber to misrepresent Canberra. I remember one
taken from Tub Bum,mix showing a starved cow
beside a. dried-up waterhole.
The Bulletin piclm-c was, if 1 may put it
that way, literally truer perhaps than the
artist thought. The writer and a hundred
other people have seen cows gazing at
half an inch of water in the Molonglo River
many a time, whilst the small sons of the
Acton dairyman were lopping the willow
trees by the side of the alleged river to pro-
vide sustenance for the beasts.
.Mr. Public House in Vie. wants the Act
under which he trades altered to put him in
line with his neighbors who sell soft tack.
They can deal out ginger-pop all night long
if they like, but he must stop at 9.30 p.m.
Nevertheless he would be well advised to.
leave things as they are. If the bars are
allowed to remain open after that hour for
the serving of raspberry vinegar only, the
temptation to oblige a customer with a
“stick” to put into it will be so -frequently
succumbed to that there will be a rare old
tearing-up of scraps of paper in the form of
publicans’ licenses.
It is reported in the daily papers:—-
“He seized this chance. He”
“I. throw that back in your teeth.”
“You can throw it back in"
“Untrue! Untrue!”
“\ ou are making' a flank attack ; we will meet it
and"-
“Despite all this display my conscience does not
accuse me.”
No, not at a meeting of the Bungalunga
Progress Association, but in Australia's
National Parliament, where a truce has been
called, and every one is bending his energies
to the conduct of the war. This is how
Fisher and Cook bend. The rest do it in
assorted shouts and snorts.
WANTED—THE TRUTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
How few were we? How many were they?
IVhat is tlie price that we have to pay?
What is the task before us set
Where the shrapnel bursts and the ranks are met?
These are the things that none may know,
But the battle calls and the death-lists grow.
The voice of the mingled tumult swells
From the shell-swept ridge at the Dardanelles,
And the months go by and the strong men fall.
Is the end in sight? Have we gained at all?
By the censored word and the boast of pride
Must Australia's faith to the end lie tried?
We are not weaklings to flinch or fail
At the last black word of a dreadful tale ;
But our hearts grow cold at the grim surmise
That the half-told truths may be whole-told lies.
If we stand for truth, let the truth be said,
For the right to hear is our best blood shed.
What foe is here that should point his gun
With a straighten aim for the word ye shun?
Shall the spring wind’s treason the tale take back
Of the loss we suffer, the things we lack?
Dr is it your timid hearts that fear
If we knew we should count the cost too dear?
Into the dark our strength must go,
Blindfold to face a wide-eyed foe,
While tales of victory find us still
Flinging like death to the first-won bill ;
And we need more men, and ever more,
To do what ye said we had done before!
We are children of light. In the strong, bright sun
Dur lives are lived and our deeds are done.
'Tell us the truth, if ye fain would fire
Dur blood to the triumph your hearts desire,
Nor fear that the whole of the stark truth told
Will make one foot in Australia cold.
But this secret war, where suspicion steals
Through the throb that the patriot soldier feels,
May end in a scorn to all men known
Of those who knew not to trust their own.
Black shame were yours if history tells
How the Censor lost us the Dardanelles.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Uncle Sam’s form, assuming that Sam is
fit and seasoned for his passages, will he an interest-
ing revelation at the A.J.C. Spring Meeting. After
his last-year victory in the Caulfield Cup the big
chestnut horse was put to the stud, and was under-
stood to have retired from racing pursuits. Subse-
quently he came back to town (as Trafalgar did for
a while), and at time of writing he is nominally a
favorite for the coming Metropolitan. Bigger than
ever, Sam has lasted through the preliminaries of a
preparation for his engagements, and, all going well,
his work on the Randwick track will be the “winding
up’,’ which was never a very severe ordeal in the
case of this exceptional gee. Owner Reid reckons
that Sam is “better than ever,” and will win the
Metropolitan. Precedents are against him. Horses
'that have been studded don’t recover their best
form, as a rule. Sam may prove an exception. The
weight (9st. 41b.) would hardly stop the giant if he
were his old self, and as a 7-year-old he is still
fresher for racing purposes than many younger-horses
that have been more knocked about. All the same,
nobody who knows the game will back Uncle Sam for
the Metropolitan until he has been fairly tested on
the track or in a w.f.a. race.
* * * «
The Spring-Summer meetings at Rand-
wick, Caulfield and Flemington will test the relative
merits of imported and native-born horseflesh as thev
never were tested before. Last season three of the
big handicaps—Metropolitan, Futurity Stakes and
Australian Cup—went to foreigners, one of them,
Lempriere, being an American, and none of them
carrying a first-class burden. A lot of others were in
training, and, all things considered, the imported
houses didn’t make as good a show as in the two
previous seasons when they were less numerous. This
season a German bomb dropped on any important
handicap field would be likely to hit an English-bred
animal. Most of the importations have been let in
lightly enough'. Ben has got only 7st. 41b. for the
Caulfield Cup, and can afford to earn a penalty in the
meantime. Hash of Steel is kindly treated with
7st. 121 b. for the Epsom, seeing that he was good to
win the Futurity Stakes last February, when, being
bred to English time, he was younger than our three-
year-olds. William the Silent, well backed for the
Metropolitan, is asked to carry no more than 6st.
121 b. Evidently the liandicapper thought none the
better of William for his having been silently born
in the Cold Country. In fact, handicappers must have
good reason for thinking that most of the imported
horses were poor things from the outset, or that they
are apt to deteriorate in the warmer climate. The
case of the rather weedy Almissa, who won three good
Cups in Victoria, is regarded as exceptional. All the
same, there have been some notable instances of im-
provement in imported horses, and if there are going
to be any very dead birds for the Spring gamble,s they
will probably be among the little crowd of lightly-
weighted newchums.
* * * *
“Whip and Shoes”: Horse-sinners who
struggle over weight problems and their possibilities
have something to consider in the two Epsom candi.
dates Machine Bov (Machine Gun—Flower Girl) and
La- Balfour (Balfour —La Belle). Machine Boy is
thjjv champion Northern N.S.W. performer, and the
other day won the handicap at Wallsend
9st. 31b., and ran second with 9st. 111 b. at
Newcastle on Saturday. In the Epsom Machine Boy
will carry only fist. 121 b drop of 331 b. on the
Maitland win. La Balfour’s best success was at
Canterbury Park (Sydney) on Saturday with Bst.
151 b. more than the Epsom weight. Now, you
take your choice and back your fancy.
Quiraing, Dr. Ewan Frazer’s big Sydney
house, was sold last week, so it may be assumed that
this horse-owner has left the country for good. He
began racing in a small way a dozen years ago at
Bong Bong and other picnic meetings in N. S.
Wales. Becoming infected with the love of the
game, he bought at generous figures, with the re-
sult that his colors figured at the front in big events
both at Randwick and Flemington. He was an
enthusiastic believer in the “figure system” of breed-
ing, and could talk it with considerable fluency.
For one who went into the racing business knowing
nothing whatever about horses, he picked up a
wonderful amount of knowledge in a short time. He
was a member of the committee of the A.J.C. and a
non-bettor.
Trouble in Bananaland since the Govern-
ment decided to take from the racing, clubs certain
dividend fractions hitherto unpaid to investors has
assumed a new aspect. Assistant-Minister Fihellv re
cently gave a broad hint to the Q.T.C. that if the clubs
were overcome with the difficulties of working under
the new conditions, the Government would be pre-
pared to take over the totalisators and do the job
itself. There were more people suddenly interested in
that highly-commendable remark than the racing
clubs; there were some members of the Government
Caucus who arose and heartily shook hands with the
proposal, and swore they would never desert it until
the machines were State-run. To give an idea of what
the clubs were scooping in fractions, I'ihelly says
that up to the end of August £602 had been paid
into consolidated revenue, representing fractions of a
penny, since the new rule came in force on July 1
That averages £3OO a month. Before the altered
conditions most of the clubs held back fractions of a
shilling I
* * * *
Is.S.W. s most elaborate recent embezzler
m connection with the grand old industry of trying
to keep pace with fast and not-so-fast horses turned
up the other day at West Maitland Quarter Sessions.
He had been a bank manager at Wallsend, and had
dipped for over £3600. The police said there was
no doubt that, excepting the cost of a motor-car,
practically all the money had gone on overdue
racing nags. “Three years’ hard labor,” said the
Judge, and another well-meaning enthusiast went
■along the Mugs’ Corridor.

Forest Trince, Sydney-owned and Maori-

L. N. Steeple at Adelaide. Carlmalion was a better
favorite, but fell, and the Prince won easily from
LI Progress, who was giving him over a stone. As
it happened, the second, on weighing in, failed by
threequarters of a pound to produce the steadying

nine years old, No. 9 in the racing-book, No. 9 at
the post, and ninth favorite on the tofcalisator.
Its owner did not win £9999, but that wasn't his
fault.
Some idea of the grip that trotting has
got on Maoriland can be got from the fact that
during last season the governing association handed
out no less than 2397 riders’, drivers’ and trainers’
licenses. The biggest scrap on earth doesn’t seem
to be affecting the sport. At the Metropolitan meet-

be scattered amounts to £lo,ooo—.the same as'last

“Ranji” has lost an eye, one of his two
greatest -physical assets. Those astonishing leg
glides ofhis, and the late cuts which sent the ball
banging to the fence between the wicket-keeper and
the finest 1 of slips, were due to his eye. The same
marvellous organ made him a beautiful game-shot, a
first-rate. billiard player, and an adept at most
other kindred sports. It seems absurd to get badly
wounded on a Scotch grouse moor after fighting in
Flanders for six months, but such experiences are
common. “Bay” Middleton, one of the best and
most daring riders to hounds that England ever pro-
duced, broke his neck jumping a three-foot drain, and
Roddy Owen, who won the Grand National on Father
O’Flynn, and fought hard in Egypt and on the

As the war is teaching us to do things like this,.
I’m trying to have a kind thought about it.
The “Homing Tyre,” patented all over
the world by the wealthy.squattocratic syndicate that
has taken it up, is the invention of Edwin Jones, of
Melbourne, _ who instructs the workmen in how to
make it with cocoamit fibre. Jones is an Ancient
Mariner, holding a master’s certificate, and his tyre
was a nautical inspiration, so to speak. It is claimed
to be the thing for rough travelling. Whereas an
ordinary rubber tyre carried for j emergency fise
costs from £7 upwards, the “Homing”—which can-
not blow out, neither can broken bottles cut it to
pieces—costs only 555. It holds its own with, the
.rubbers in a run on a smooth road,; afid has proved
equal to 35 miles an hour. A -great character
is ex-mariner Jones. The Lusitania and Arabic
piracies (he formerly served on the; Arabic) moved
him to offer himself as a recruit. Each time he
passed the examination up to the point where one of
his legs failed in the bending test. Now he has a
scheme for forming an independent band of war
workers, who will pay their own passages to Egypt
and give their services as * able-bodied veteran handy-
men. Lots of old sailors and others are asking for a
chance to do something. Jones proposes to charier
a ship and take the handy-men to Alexandria.
There is to be an untidy scramble for the*

HIS SYSTEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
George Arthur lodged with us at Kay's.
He was a slim and natty youth,
Gentle and nice in all his ways.
It shocked us much to learn the truth-
He made his living backing horses,
Or picking winners on the courses.
He picked a winner every day,
And sometimes hit on four or five,
So specialised in going gay,
And found it easy to contrive
To have two stalls for every show,
And blow the champagne bubbles-o.
He owned he paid for little dinners,
And motor-cars could hire all day
H.v going out and picking winners;
But nothing further would he say.
His system we believed to be
A copper-bottomed certainty.
George Arthur lives no more with Kay—
The peelers have curtailed his fun.
He found three winners Caulfield way,
And someone caught him picking one.
He watched the bookies paying out,
Then picked the winners in the rout!

WHY SUFFER TORTURE BY THE CRUEL
ELECTRIC NEEDLE?
ELECTRICITY ALWAYS STIMULATES HAIR GROWTH.
HOW TO KIL*L AND DISSOLVE OUT ROOTS AND ALL.
For the benefit of Sydney “Bulletin” readers, Lady explains how she accidentally discovered
a New Absorption Process which Permanently Removed her Hairy Mask, after Electricity,
Tweezers, Caustic Pastes, Potions, Powders, and all other Depilatories and Advertised
Remedies had absolutely failed to do anything but harm.
By following simple directions given below any woman now lias the means of easily
preparing and using in her own home this wonderful process, which has hitherto been a
carefully-guarded secret known only to a few high-priced specialists. Pull directions are
now made public for the first time.
All who are afflicted with superfluous hair
will be interested to learn of the amazing
discovery made by Miss Kathryn B. Firmin,
who until recently was deeply humiliated
by these repulsive growths upon her face,
neck and arms. As the hair constantly
became more thick and hideous she tried
every process and remedy advertised or
recommended, but found
to her sorrow that if
any of these removed
hair at all, the effects
were only temporary,
and new growths soon
appeared stronger than
ever. Even hours of
torture under the cruel
electric needle simply
meant great pain, a
sore and blemished
skin, and the inevit-
able disappointment.
After spending huge
sums in efforts to be
rid of her terrible and
beauty-d estroying
affliction, Miss Firmin
was about to give up
in despair, when by
chance she learned of
a means by which the
beauties of Ancient
Rome are said to have
permanently banished
superfl nous hair.
With only a very slight clue as to the nature
of this remarkable process used in bygone
ages, Miss Firmin tells how she set to work
experimenting in her tireless effort to wrest
the lost secret from the past. From the
accounts of Miss Firmin’s discovery, which
have recently aroused so much *' interest
among women with superfluous hair, there
seems to be no doubt that at last there has
been found a way, most radically different
from anything hitherto known, by which
any woman can now rid herself permanently,
harmlessly and painlessly of all superfluous
hair-growths by dissolving them out of ex-
istence, root and all. One part of the pro-
cess consists of a solution easily obtained
After she had endured for ten years the humilia-
tion of having a heard and moustache like a man.
and after electrolysis, pastes, ‘‘lotions.” and all
other methods had failed absolutely, Miss Firmin
killed all her superfluous hair in a single night
by the harmless new absorption process fully
explained in this article.
and prepared by anyone, which possesses
the remarkable quality of being readily
absorbed by the hair, so that it creeps
down to the root, dissolving as it goes,
just as oil creeps up a lamp-wick. It is,
perhaps, needless to caution any who may
use this process, which has so deadly an
effect upon the hair, that it must never by
any chance be per-
mitted to touch hair
which is not to be
destroyed. In ex-
plaining the process
Miss Firmin mentions
that it is perfectly
neutral and ineffective
to the skin, as anyone
can quickly prove by
experiment, but she
disclaims all responsi-
bility for permanent
loss of desirable hair,
such as eyebrows, hair
of the head, etc., to
which the process is
applied. Even though
the accidental appli-
cation be insufficient
to dissolve the hair at
once, it will eventually
die and fall out, and
there exists no known
means for restoring
life to hair roots thus
affected.
For the benefit of any readers who may
be interested, and who wish to be rid of
their superfluous hair by this remarkable
process, we are authorised to announce that
Miss Firmin has agreed to send all neces-
sary particulars regarding its preparation
and use to any reader sufficiently interested
to send her two penny stamps for return
postage. Simply address Miss Kathryn B.
Firmin (Suite 631. P.), 133 Oxford Street,
London, W. (Eng.), and full information
will be sent by return post in plain, sealed
envelope. On account of the great demands
upon Miss Firmin’s time, she has stipu-
lated that this offer must be announced to
positively expire at the end of 60 days.

“Q.K.” : Chemists and all other buyers of
perfumes, soaps and things for the “trade” are
laughing at the story of how Julius Blau
talked the Commonwealth Ministers into
letting him get away to America on what
is alleged to have been a bogus mission. Of
course he satisfied Hughes and the others of
his bona fides, after his friend and admirer
Carr, had introduced him to them.
Blau and liis agency for the “4711'’ brand
of eau-de-Cologne have always been a mat-
ter of interest to the trade, and to inquisi-
tive outsiders who had wondered how the
“4711” brand came to Hood the market. There
are at least two better brands, but “4711"
fairly got this country by the nose. It was
all in the personality of Blau, the "natu-
ralised Hungarian” partner in a German
firm. Julius Blau was far and away the
most persuasive salesman in the business.
Years ago -when I sought an explanation of
the “4711” mystery I was told that Julius
could whistle a bird off a tree. “All
the travellers in the trade take their
hats off to Julius,” it was said.
Evidently Hughes has had to take
his hat off to the plausible Hungarian-
German gentleman, apd will swear into it
whenever henceforth the name of the in-
gratiating foreigner is mentioned.
“Croson”: I observe that, through the
shire councils, the Peacock Government is
inquiring of the man on the land what labor
he is likely to require during the coming
harvest, with a view to organising the sup-
ply. Heaven knows farm labor needs organ-
ising badly enough ; liut 1 am not sure that
the Government’s idea of “organisation”
coincides with mine. The other day Henry
Chaplin, farm laborer, sued a Bass Valley
farmer for £l7 short paid on .'!4 weeks’ labor.
It appeared that Chaplin and his grown-up son
and daughter had toiled at the monotonous
job of teat-pulling for 34 weeks; and then
trouble started. Whereas the boss averred
the stipulated wages—for the three adults —-
was £3 per week and “find” themselves,
Chaplin swore it was £3 10s. The hours
were from 7 a.in. to 3 p.m. in winter, and
from 4 a.in. to S p.m. in summer. Even
the honorariums shivered in front of the
icicle who was prepared to defend such soul-
less sweating, and allowed the claim.
“Billybunger” : It isn't all cakes and fizz
with the wool cultivator these days. A big
Queensland station took off its clip in July,
1014. Along came the war. knocking local
wool sales on the head, and the clip was
stored at Brisbane for seven months, waiting
for the buyers to open their mouths. The
charges for storage and insurance were no
soft snap. Eventually the wool was sent to
England for sale, and bumped heavy freight,
insurance, “bomb tax” of 2s. (id. a bale. etc.
It cost £1 a bale to sell that clip after land-
ing it at St. Katherine’s dock, London. To
date, nearly 12 months after the shearing.no
payment has been received, and shearing is
about to commence again. That means stiff
interest for the wherewithal to finance the
harboring. Then there are the drought losses
and the stoppage of mutton export to be con-
sidered. It's nnly a few weeks ago that Pre-
mier Ryan induced the British Government
to take Banahalffnd carcases under the con-
ditions which N. S. Wales enjoys. That
relieved the situation a little, and allowed
part of the squattocracy to indulge once more
in tobacco and toothpicks. In tlie matter of
fire-water they’ve been following the King.
* * * *
The war has made the Yankee motor-car
buzz as it never buzzed before. During the
11 months from August of last year to June
of this, 21,000 cars were sent from N’Yark
to Europe, their value, plus the value of
motor parts and tyres, being £8,200,000. And
the business is still jumping like an in-
furiated wild-cat. In the same period how
many cars has Australia not exported?
“De Oriel” : The introduction by "Tiaki”

his own coffin brings to mind a resident of
Forth (TasA who grew a black wood tree
until, there being sufficient timber in it for
his purpose, he had it cu't down and shipped
to England. There it: was made into the

A RHYME OF ASSORTED MEAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The butcher waited beside his block in an odor of
ancient fat,
And to the dowager prowl and prim he amiably
a nswered : “ Thu 11
Why, that is the primest of dairy-beef, and a very
nice piece of meat!
Yes, mum —four pounds with the bone in it, and the
value is hard to beat.
Ten bob for the lot!” With a bunted look tlw
dowager murmured: “Oh!
It really is dear!'’ But tlie butcher took
'The elderly meat from its shiny hook,
And said, as he parcelled it up: “Oh, yes —hut y'
gotter have meat, y’ Know !”
A year went by, and tlie last, lone cow for butcher’s
meat had died,
And the same old butcher stood and served the same
old block beside,
And the same old dowager sought his shop for a
trifle whereon to dine;
And “Rabbits Are Cheap To-day”—outside she saw
ids simple sign.
“Yes, mum, a dollar a pair,” he said. “Fat ’tins —
tlie price is low.”
“Dear me, how dear!" the dowager said ;
But the butcher waggled his greasy head:
“V" gotter have meat-—or as near to it as yer able
to get, y" know.”
A few years later and trawler-tack was Australia’s
daily dish,
And the butcher waited beside his block in an odor
of frozen fish ;
Then the dowager, bent and exceeding old, and palsied
of hand and tongue,
iloved slowly, with an appraising eye, the deep-sea
dead among.
She made her choice of a sea-meat steak from the
glittering, frozen show,
And sadly a sov. she placed upon
The butcher’s palm, and her smile was wan
As she breathed: “Ah, fish! In tlie (food old days we
used to have meat, you know!”

Robust Parents—A Healthy Baby.
The secret of health and happiness
is careful attention to the first signs of
coining disorders. When you get
at trifling mishaps, when vou
are nervy and irritated—especially" in
the hot weather—when you feel run
down and are dull and heavy—when
you are nervous and despondent regard-
ing the future—when pains attack your
kidneys and heart and between your
shoulders—you know- that your system
is in immediate need of 'the tonic—
Fisher’s Phosplierine—the only nerve and
brain tonic and body-builder. Of Fisher’s
Phospherine the great public analyst,
F. H. Molesworth, F.C.S., F.G.S., said
that: “It is composed of pure chemi-
cals carefully combined.... is a power-
ful tonic and will be specially valuable
in cases—chronic and otherwise —of
neuralgia, rheumatism and kindred ner-
vous disorders. It will have a bene-
ficial action on the kidneys, and will
be a good aid to digestion.’’

BEFORE THE MIRROR.
By “JEANNETTE.”
“Jeannette,” the well-known writer on Beauty Culture and author of “The Book of Beautv,”
will be pleased to help and advise any reader on matters of the toilet. Queries should be accom-
panied by a stamped addressed envelope, arid directed to “Jeannette/’ c/o “Before' the Mirror,”
43 Gray’s Inn lioad, London, W.C., England.
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and all of
us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow over the
lives of many of us women, and while, perhaps, a few—the more stoical amongst
"s—can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we may all, with a little
care and foresight, succeed in preventing the results of worry from being notice-
able in our appearance. To these fortunate few this little chat will, however, be
as interesting and instructive as to those who stand in real need of help in toilet
matters, and may be the means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown
method of retaining, or regaining, that beauty of face and figure which is the birth-
right of every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present,
not generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Wrinkles, and How to Remove them. —Worry,
late hours, or the passing of old Father Time
may cause those ugly little lines which so
detract from the freshness and charm of a
woman’s face; but the cure is always the
same. Feed the tissues beneath the skin, and
massage them with a reliable skin food,
which, while nourishing the fatty tissues,
will not coarsen the skin nor grow hairs upon
the face, as so many inferior creams do. To
remove the wrinkles bathe the face with hot
water, wipe it dry; then, while it is still
warm, smear a little mercolised wax over the
whole face, carrying it well down on the neck,
and, with the tips of the fingers, rub it gently
into the pores, working in an upward and
outward direction. Wipe off any superfluous
wax, leaving a little on the skin all night.
In the morning wash off with warm water
and Pilenta soap. The use of the wax not
only feeds the skin but removes the dead,
outer cuticle, giving the fresh, young- skin
beneath an opportunity to breathe and show
itself.
lieautifui Hair—How to Shampoo.—Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky, depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once in
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stallax granules in a cup of hot water, fill a
basin with warm water, into which tlie ends
of the hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse, and dry by fanning with a palm fan,
or in the open air, if the weather permits.
Should the hair be naturally Very greasy, the
oil massage should be omitted. Stallax can
be bought at any chemist’s in quarter-pound
sealed packages: it keeps indefinitely, and one
one package contains sufficient for twenty-five
or thirty shampoos:
The Question of Powder. —Powder should
never be used by anyone with a tendency to
wrinkle, for it fills up the lines on the face,
and tends to deepen and accentuate the wrin-
kles. In the place of powder, get about one
ounce of cleminite from any chemist, and dis-
solve it in four tablespoons of warm water.
Place it in a bottle, and apply to the skin with'
the finger tips, allowing it to dry on the face.
This gives the skin a soft, peacli-like bloom,
and prevents that unbecoming, greasy appear-
ance which is the bane of many a woman’s
life.
A Tonic for the Hair. —During the spring and
early summer, the hair generally needs a little
stimulant to its growth, in. the form of a
tonic. To make a simple and inexpensive one.
at home, take four ounces of bay rum, and
add to it one ounce of borannim. Shake thor-
oughly, and leave for thirty minutes, then
strain, and add Sufficient water to make half
a pint. At night, massage the scalp for ten
minutes, then dab the mixture into the roots
with a soft sponge. Five minutes’ brushing
in the-morning will he found beneficial in giv-
ing an added gloss to tlie hair
To Wave the Hair. —llot irons, when employed
to wave the hair, not only make it harsh and
brittle, spoiling color of fair or auburn hair,
biit induce a tendency towards greyness. To
give a wave to straight hair, damp it with
silmerine and either plait, tying the ends, or
arrange in waving pins for a short time. A
couple of ounces will last quite a long time.
A Greasy Skin and Hlaekheads. — Blackheads
are absolutely fatal to beauty, for they give a
coarse, dirty look to the face which no cos-
metics can ever hide. The way to remove
blackheads quickly and effectively has only
recently been discovered. For many years
those who suffered in this way were restricted
in their diet, denied sweets, and had to suffer
other privations. Modern science has, how-
ever, provided a simple, effective and quick
remedy. Dissolve one stymol tablet in a glass
of hot water, and when the effervescence has
subsided, dip a small, soft sponge into the
liquid, and bathe the face. Leave for a few
minutes, then dry with a towel, and the black-
heads will come off. For a greasy skin, bathe
' the face three times a week with stymol. and
spray with cold water every morning, using a
vulcanite throat spray.
To Reduce the Figure. —With the present
fashions, even more than with the tight skirts,
it is imperative that the-woman who wishes to
look smart should be slim. To reduce one’s
weight without injuring one’s health is no
easy matter, and can only be done by taking-
some specific which will counteract the natural
tendency towards putting on flesh. A few
clynol berries, eaten regularly, will speedily
transform the fat, ungainly figure into one of
slim and graceful proportions, without any in-
convenience whatever, and in a very short
time. Clynol berries are quite pleasant to the
taste, having a marked peppermint flavor.
To Restore Grey Hair to its Original Color. —r
Streaks of grey, whether in fair or dark hair,
are always unbecoming, and prove a cruel tell-
tale of age. It is not generally known that
an ounce of tammalite, which can be bought
at any chemist’s, mixed with four ounces of
bay rum, makes a most satisfactory lotion for
restoring grey hair to its natural color. Apply
the lotion night and morning with a soft,
toothbrush, and, after a few days, the hair
will be found to be gradually returning to its
original shade.
Superfluous Hair—its Cause and Cure. —Super-
fluous hair is invariably the result of using
inferior soap or bad face creams. To remove
the hairs, apply a little powdered pheminol
mixed to a paste with cold water and applied
to the skin with a bone knife. The skin
should be dusted with powdered alum before
applying the pheminol. and the paste removed
after being left on for two minutes; This
treatment is recommended not only to remove
the growth temporarily, but to eventually kill
the roots. [2

a scalded cat and jolt like a bucking tram....
Femina: Don’t use parodies much, and yours' is a
poor one of the species.... R.N.G.: Bad medley just

a stick and a kerosene-tin would do it for less money.

(W.A.) : One of the nightmare series. Let’s say' no
more about it.
S.” : Ssme years ago the ferryboat
Manly got into trouble about Middle Head.
She was filled with passengers, and Sydney
was nearer to the long-expected catastrophe
than it was aware of. Panic-stricken offi-
cialdom then decided on thorough-going
measures with regard to life-saving appli-
ances, and every ferry proceeding beyond
George’s Head has since then had to be
equipped with anchors, chains and distress
signals, the same as coasting vessels.
Through a combination of good luck and
good managing there had not arisen a single
occasion to use these things—until two
youths lately boarded the’ Cygnet, lying up
for overhaul. Finding the signal bombs
they started to experiment with a hammer.
There was a deafening report (these things
are designed to attract notice within a 10-
miles’ radius) and a very dead boy. Curi-
osity kills more than a cat when it gets a
fair chance.
“Canuck” : Lately I observed in the door-
way of a Richmond (Melb.) grocery several
sets of blacking brushes, marked “Is. the
set of three.” The goods- being of fairly
good make the price was obviously absurd,
so I investigated and found that certain
importers were selling the sets wholesale at
10s. Od. per doz. They also had a line of
combined polishing and blacking brushes at
4s Od. per doz. Both lines came from
Japan. Going further I found that 'he
lowest quotations of Australian-made brushes
were: polishing. 95.: blacking, Bs.; and dirt
7s. Od. per dozen —245. per doz. for sets of
three. I had just recollected that these
10s. Od. and 4s. Od. Japanese lines had
already paid a duty of 05 per cent, ad vat.
when I was called away to attend a non-
political meeting to “organise for the pur-
pose of capturing Germany’s trade.” '
A Sydney paper, discussing the hole-and-
corner “selection” of members of Parliament
by Liberal and Labor Leagues, demands to
know “what is to stop any wirepuller, acting
for a candidate or against him. offering in-
ducements to a member of the league to vote
in one direction or abstain from voting in
anotherV” Nothing, of course. On the
other hand, there will be a large inducement
to pull wires so long as the capture of a
small party machine is equivalent, under the
party system, to the capture of a whole con-
stituency.
TO A MISERABLE YELPER.
Stop it, pale, piffling poet!
Curses upon your head!
You are a sham, and you know it !
Stop it, you babbling poet!
Go and yelp under the bed !
Into the dustbox your rubbish cram !
Back" to the bush you infernal sham !
BLAST all your blitherings ! BLAST AND DAMN ! !

A beautiful memorial church has just been
erected at Tamrookum to the memory of the
late R. M. Collins, pastoralist and good
fellow. But Collins’s real memorial will
be the conserving of the noble Laming-
ton Plateau as a State park—a step which
he advocated and assisted with real public-
spirit on all occasions.
That Captain Colin Austin whose death
at Gallipoli was reported last week was a

He took Kitchener’s eve during the Boer
discord, and it was at the big fellow’s iuvita-;
tion that, yohrig Austin stayed behind after
the war ended.
One Pooran Dabee Singh, a dweller in

mans may. Pooran Dabee Singh wants
to know from the Chief Secretary' if this
is the reward his countrymen receive _ for
battling against the Gerhog in Belgium,
France and Gallipoli. In the same specious
manner somebody might now raise an equally
uncomfortable point for'Pooran Dabee Singh
to perch upon. .It is only necessary to ask
him whether it was for rewards, then, that
the brave Indian troops-have been battling
in Europe.
“E.N.M.” on a scheme that Ned Kelly
overlooked :—•
As a money-maker in a good cause —or any old
cayise —give me a “mock court” such as was held
at Brisbane’s Patriotic day shivoo. The proceedings
were at once decorous, liquorbus, hilarious and
meritorious. The judges (Frank Boucher, C.J. ;
Tom Welsby and W. Smythe) took part in the pro-
cession in wigs, red robes, etc. Pat Ranson was
Grown Prosecutor. J. Cahill (a nephew of Queens-
land’s Police Commissioner)- and W. Webb were coun-
sel for defendants; but when it was found, that they
charged £1 fees, and invariably ..begged the .Bench
to double all fines imposed, most of their clients
just curled up. It cost a bob for any of the
public to enter the court—and 2s. 6d. to get out.
Every now and then all hands were fined for “loiter-
ing,” and every then and now the Court adjourned
for a drink —whereupon Tom Welsby would fine
himself 2s. 6d for adjourning the Court and an-
other 2s. 6d. for having the drink. Innocent by-
standers who drank with the Bench had to pay up
for doing it. Argument meant more fines ; one cul-
prit debated the point for 25 seconds, and was finally
'counted out for 25 half-crowns, plus his original
fine. Whittingham, M.L.C., was fined £5 for being-
known to keep and feed old racehorses that had been
dead for years. Arthur Morgan, Lieutenant-Governor,
got a £5 punch for having deserted his political
jbb, and “Jim” Clarke (Brisbane’s “Pearl King”)
was hit to leg for the midnight murdering of oysters
which if allowed to mature might have fun to seed
pearls. A leading bank-manager was bled for refus-
ing an overdraft, and the entire team of .footballers
were brought in and compelled to part. Theodore,
the Treasurer, gave up £1 for failing to turn a
deficit into a credit balance, and “Bishop” Barnes,
of the late Denham Ministry, was fined for flirting-
in the political sense. W. J. Cpakes,- a director of
Finney’s, was neatly caught for a quid. He was
charged with being on the premises without his
“Block.” The Court gathered about £250 between
1.30 and 5.30 p.m., an average, roughly, of £1 per
minute. The C.T.A. has been asked to repeat the
“Court” at an early date, and with a little more
preparation and a wider advertisement £5OO should
be netted for the wounded. In S. Australia the
Travellers did so well in the city that bands of
them are now invited up to country towns to repeat
their crime; and the Queensland Association hopes
for equal success.
“Zechariah Banana” : One of Queensland’s
upside-down laws deals with the accommo-
dation of shearers. The pastoralist is
obliged to provide a decent hut for the bar-
bers who while away their time On his run
for a few weeks in the year; but th&*men
who work for him the calendar round he
can house in any old pig-kennel. Also, the
land-holder employing less than nine men is
untouched by existing legislation, though
every bush-worker knows that it is the
small selector, and not the squatter, who
expects his hands to sleep in tanks and
spend their time between drinks beneath a
gum tree or in the shelter of an upturne'd
kerosene tin. The Assembly now threatens
to overhaul these incongruities.
“Mulga”: The rec-asing of artesian bores
is by no means a new experiment in Banana-
land. I know of several places in the War-
rego district where the plan has been man-
aged successfully, with the result that a
diminished flow has immediately returned
to its former dimensions. Boring contractors
have advocated this way of increasing flows
for years. The Canadians have seen it suc-
cessfully carried out on oil bores at home;
but as the cost is almost as much as the
original bore —from £l to 255. per foot —
THE INSOLENCE OE THESE FELLOWS!
DEPARTING BOOKKEEPER (sacked by the Boss): “Well, good lye. Sorry I have to leave
you. I'd have made a man of you if I'd stayed a little longer."
the squatter thinks hard before he chances
it. What"makes the flows fluctuate it is
hard to say. I know of two bores within
a quarter of a mile of one another, and as
the flow increases in due it decreases in the
other, and vwe versa. The temperature of
the water varies in the same manner. A fair
average flow is a million gallons daily.
O’Connor’s bore at Coongoola siding, near
Cunnamulla, yielded a daily five million gal-
lons when first struck, but was regulated to
run a far smaller quantity afterwards. Talk-
ing about regulating artesian supplies, the
waste of artesian water in Queensland was
scandalous until the Government assumed
control of the bores. Incidentally, if a per-
son is subject to rheumatism a week’s -work
on an artesian bore, screwing up , casing
after the flow has been struck, will cure
him. as a rule.
The day of the youthful Under-Secretary
has arrived in Bananaland, the latest of
the genus being T. W. McCawley, who
becomes permanent head of his Department
(Justice) at the age of 34. McCawley is a
Toowoomba boy who served as a clerk in a
solicitor’s office in that town, whence he
drifted t 0... Brisbane and joined the Public
Service. He is now a barrister of some
tonnage and has been eminently successful
in piloting Crown law business into a happy
haven. Industrious, capable and methodical,
he has few superiors in the Queensland
Public Service.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, September 4, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Brisbane had another day-out yesterday
when the actors and actresses, the stage-
hands and the call-boy united their talents
towards raising money for the Patriotic
funds. There was a procession and a matinee,
the latter at H. M. Theatre. The show-people
.with J. C. Williamson, the King’s Royal
Dramatic co., the Dandies, the Empire co.,
the Tivoli co. and Harry Plimmer (holiday-
ing) lent a helping hand, or a voice, or an
ecstatic kick, or a ragtime extract from
Shakspeare ; and even our blasd aristocracy
sat up and entered into the simple amuse-
ments of the village-folk. Benefit to funds,
about £3OO.
The National Council of Women has
opened a bureau in the Town Hall, and is
busy enrolling females for National Ser-
viee. Eve wants to know how many of her
sisters there are to help Adam (helping in
this case doesn’t merely mean looking after
his wigwam or smoothing his nerves when
he comes home with his. load of cares and
other accumulations, but Really Doing
Something while he looks after his own
wigwam and smooths his own nerves). The
questions to be answered are related to the
Australian War Census. For instance,
“What sort of work can you do?” “Will
you do regular work for payment, or will
you work voluntarily?” “How many hours
a day are you prepared to give to National
Service?” Lady Goold-Adams was the pre-
siding Eve at the N official opening of the
bureau on Tuesday/.
The Women’s- Mutual Service Club has
arranged a series of lectures on cookery,
and a number of demonstrations on cutting-
out and making-up children’s frocks. The
organisation is going aMad in fine style,
and her Ex. of the Commonwealth, admiring
it 'from afar, is forming an exactly similar
one in Melbourne.
Miss Myra Philp, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. “Jim” Philp, the well-known Aus-,
tralian writer, journeyed to Townsville this,
week, and collected Mr. Spooner, son of a
Church of England clergyman. Mrs. Philp
gave a tea-party at Rowe’s to wish good
luck to the marriage.
Two engagements, which will particularly
interest Central Queenslanders, have lately
been announced. The first is between Joan
Archer, only daughter of the Archers of
Gracemere, and Alister Archer, who is chas-
ing the Unspeakable with his mates of the
25th Battalion. The prospective bride-
groom’s parents live in Norway. The
other promise binds Miss Grace Reade, of
Capella, and young Lewis Walker, son of
Mr. and Mrs.. A. C. Walker, of Bingera
cattle station.
Yet another engagement, this time of
interest to many Sydneysiders and Brisbane
folk. The bride-to-be is Kathleen Murray,
daughter of Mr. Murray, of Gartness,
Manly, Queensland; and the groom—who
also wears the universal khaki —Gimme W.
Watson, of Maoriland. Miss Murray has
been on the stage .for the last year, and had
good prospects of> “making a name.” But
why waste time manufacturing an article
that may not satisfy you when one that
fills the bill is waiting on the spot?
The prospective groom has three brothers
with the army, and the other party to the
contract has a brother, five cousins and
three uncles at the Front. The brother is
Lt.-Surgeon A. Murray, with our boys at
the Dardanelles.
• Two University lads who are doing well
in the locality are Norman Lloyd and Fred
Small. Both left here with the sappers.
Lloyd has been made a sergeant with
the Fourth field company of engineers, at-
tached to the second division. Young Small,
who is a grandson of the late Capt.
Trouton, of Sydney, has been appointed
quartermaster-sergeant of the Fifth field
company of engineers, with the second divi-
sion of the Australian Forces.
One of the members of the Assembly, Mr.
Grayson, was thrown out of a motor-car the
other day while on a recruiting expedition.
The vehicle in which he travelled collided
with another car, out of which two children
were hurled in the same untidy manner as
the legislator. It was- the party’s lucky day,
for it was all more hurtled than hurt.
A factory for manufacturing sheepskin
vests for Tommy Bananaland has been
started. Several generous donations of
skins have already been made, but some
thousands more are urgently wanted. Three
of the jumbuck’s wrapper make two vests,
so if any good Queenslander wishes to do
something more for the boys in the trenches
—it will be mighty cold soon in Gallipoli—
all he or , she has to do is to kill the fatted
lamb and forward its pelt to the lied Cross
Society.
Godfrey Rivers, who has guided the
stumbling pencils of' at least two genera-
tions of Brisbane boys and girls, has re-
signed his position as head of the art depart-
ment of the Technical College, and shortly
will pack up his canvas and paints and flit
to the Apple Isle. Thence he goes to Eng-
land. Many a budding artist will remember
the kindness of Godfrey Rivers when times
were hard. At least one Brisbane artist
received an offer of the cash necessary to
pay for his studies abroad, but he was not
able to accept the generous offer, and since
lias made good in the South.
Wyndliam Pike, son of the managing
director of Pike Bros., has joined the motor
transport section of the Kangaroos, with
his cousin, E.. Hayes,
Dr. Costello Shaw received a cable this
week saying that his. son, Roy., who went
to England to efilisf. had been given a
commission in the Artillery.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The death of Patrick Robertson Gordon,
ior many years Queensland’s Chief Inspec-
tor of Stock, removes one of the best-known
men in the State. Gordon was not only an
official of weight; he . was also a _ writer
whose pen on all matters pertaining to
sheep, cattle and land always commanded
attention and respect: Among other things
he has the credit of having introduced the
present brands system of Bananaland, which
is generally admitted as an improvement on
that of almost every other country. In
private life Gordon was known as an ardent
lover of music, Death snapped his major
chord in his 85th. year. .. : c .
After many years’ urging, the_ Depart-
ment of Public Instruction has decided that
attendance at German schools is not to be
regarded as valid excuse for absence from
the State schools. Teachers are now' wait-
ing to see whether Minister Hardacre is
vertebrate or invertebrate. Past adniinis-
f ration of the compulsory clauses of the
Education Act merely excited public snickers
and pedagogic snorts. " ..,
“Outback”: In doing its bit in the
Empire’s need, Longreach, in the wild and
woolly West, has a better record than even
Charleville. Since the big argument started
360 men from there have left for the Front,
and others are moving. This does not count
the men who have enlisted from other places.
As Longreach lias subscribed £7OOO to the
Patriotic Funds, and on Queensland Day
weighed in with .over £2600 as well, it is
emphatically keeping its end up.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long us possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

HAVE YOU GOT
CATARRH ?
If you have a dropping; of phlegm into the throat,
If your nose is stopped up,
If crusts form in your nose,
If you are easily susceptible to colds,
If you suffer from frontal headaches,
If you have noises in the head,
If your hearing is affected,
If you have to clear your throat and expectorate often,
if a change in the weather affec is you,
If you are a victim to shortness of breath,
If you sneeze frequently,
If your sense of smell is affected,
y° u have a heavy, tired feeling on awaking,
If you suffer from a husky throat,
If you are affected with any of the above symptoms,
the chances are that you are suffering from
It is an exceedingly dangerous com-
plaint, and is so insidious that the sufferer hardly
realises how serious is his or her condition until
matters have reached an almost chronic stage.
Catarrh. often begins with a cold in the bead, hut it never stops there.
1 ie simple cold becomes a protracted one, while the discharge from the
nose grows more piofuse and uncomfortable.
Ihe inflammation extends to the throat and bronchial tubes, causing
hoarseness, a tickling sensation, and an aggravating cough. The matter
that is continually dropping hack into the throat finds its way into the
Etomach, resulting in a distressing form of dyspepsia, nausea, and loss of
appetite and strength.
The catarihal poisons are absorbed into the blood, and all the memhianes
of the body become infected. Wliat was supposed to he a purely local
uisease has become constitutional, deep-seated, and chronic, and may
eventually result in Deafness, Bronchitis, Asthma, Neuritis, Catarrh of
the Stomach, or that dread scourge of the'numan race, Consumption.

HERDER, 22 Daking House, Sydney,
THE outstanding charm and originality of the
shoe here illustrated lie in its side fastening,
and fascinating side ornament. The effect
gained by this mere transposing of a buckle is
amazing. It gives the foot a delightfully smart,
almost saucy look, besides accentuating the arch of
the instep. Indeed, so charming is this type
of shoe that, in a pleasant variety of styles
and lasts, it figures largely in the new Bos- ,
-toek range of models lately arrived at the
leading stores.
Ladies will find this range a perfect
treasure-trove of delightful shoes, all striking
that particular note of individuality which
makes them elegant as well as smart, and all
possessed of unrivalled fitting properties.
Purchasers should sbe that the name Bostock
is stamped on the soles of every pair.

Captain Vallange, the long, lean Madden
son-in-law, is in charge of a receiving-station
for aeroplane news on the English coast.
When a fagged airman hops in, grunting
something about a Zeppelin being on its way
back to the Eatherland with a broken tail,
Vallange hastily puts the glad tidings into
publishable English and bustles it over the
wire to the War Office. You will remember
him as an A.D.C. here in the misty past.
Stout Guy Madden is employed for the
present at transport work. For years he
clothed his three-ply chest in a Highland
uniform (I suppose because the family is
Irish), but he has not yet been accepted for
service abroad. Like many other would-be
Gallipolites who were in the soldiering busi-
ness before 1914, he has been found to be
too useful here. Still, he hopes to be some-
where near Constantinople before the end of
the year.
A masterpiece of strategy in ticket opera-
tions stands to the credit of the three
matrons who are pledged to run the
“Oriental” monthly song teas. Instead of
bring six ss. tickets at Mrs. Suburbia by
post, the trio sent along the 25 bobs’ worth
with a kindly letter inviting the recipients
to decorate the committee. Work, nominal;
admittance to each show (and presumably
to the committee itself), ss. a month. P.S.
—Contributions to be sold or raffled tor the
cause thankfully received. Mrs. Suburbia
swallowed the bait very nicely, and she
swore to stump up, even if it entailed butter-
less bread, as a thanksgiving offering for
being asked to mix in such high circles.
1 rovidence, if it takes any interest what-
ever in high circles, must have intended
them for that sort of work.
Percy Rowan, killed in action at Gallipoli,
was a son of the late Andrew Rowan, Vic-
torian wine-cellarman. He went to Wes-
tralia some time ago to take up land, and
started for the war with the W.A. Light
Horse. His mother still lives at the old
Brighton-road home, but most of the family'
is scattered. The fallen soldier was a
nephew of the John Maddens, the C.J. and
Andrew Rowan having each married a
Stephen sister.
Rear Canon Snodgrass, vicar of St.
Paul’s, Geelong (Vic.), has for long been
recognised as an expert creator of a refined
drawing-room atmosphere. His bachelor
days-at-home at Geelong are a rosy dream,
and his afternoon-tea manner most soothing
and benign. He dotes on cats, and has a
tribe of the quadrupedal variety about the
vicarage, always prepared to supply a tor-
toiseshell kitten to any parishioner who may
need something by w T hich to remember her
dear adviser. The late Janet Clarke was a
Snodgrass, and the William Clarke connec-
tion at least did Evelyn Snodgrass no harm
in his upward climb to the perfect peace of
a cat-encompassed canonry.
The John Langs, w T ho some time ago
struck a rich financial patch and went to
inhabit a five-acre pleasaunce in the most
heavily-gilded portion of South Yarra, are
in England, where they are taking a rest
after a strenuous period of honorary labor
at a military hospital. John Lang, who
married a daughter of the late Colonel
Umphelby, is a Melbourne solictor, best
known as secretary of the annual Henley-on-
the-Yarra diversion. Pie is about six inches
under the military height, which partly
accounts for his not departing with the Aus-
tralian troops; but at the hospital the
authorities made him a captain, in spite of
his stature. Dr. W. H. Lang, V.A.T.C.
handicapper, is John’s uncle, and the late
Andrew Lang, of England (he of the
brindled hair”) was another.
War isn’t all—well, what General Sher-
man said it was. I know of one army nurse
who got. herself engaged to a nice officer
in S’Africa by allowing him to brush her
hair for her. And now here’s Philip Gibbs
describing how he. tried to be guide and
chaperone to a fugitive hosnital staff during
the heaviest fighting in Belgium, and how he
had some trouble to round up the nurses
who were “getting out of hand and indulging
in private adventures.” One of them, a buxom
and jolly soul, who “didn’t care a damn,”
had established friendly relations with a
naval lieutenant, and “I had great trouble in
dragging her away from his engaging conver-
sation. Others had discovered a shop where
coffee was being served to British
soldiers, who were willing to share it with
attractive ladies.” It might interest you to
know that he finally got the lot—including
some frightened nuns—into a beer tavern, the
nuns breasting the bar with the reverend
mother in the centre, wearing, as Gibbs says,
“a little aureole round her head from the
glamor of the pewter pots.”
Katie Turner is a young metal worker
who, with ordinary luck, should wrest a well-
buttered crust from the world. Architect
Pladdon, being impressed with her skill, is
giving her a shove along; and the Arts and
Crafts are showing some of her stuff, includ-
ing settings for enamels and jewels, as well
as large, useful things.
. One rest-house for our returned wounded
is run by a member of the Toorak peerage
who lacks insight or something. Tea is
served there in the evenings by his express
command. Apropos of this he explained
loftily to a friend : “I have chosen nice, sen-
sible servants, from my own staff and from
the houses of friends, to wait on the soldiers
women of their own class, y’know, so that
they will not feel embarrassed.” And then
the Duke, having made his inferiors com-
fortable, went and had another roll in his
money.
Miss Armytage, who shared the vice-
presidency of the absurd little Gollywogs
with Melba, has opened a shop in the new
Elizabeth II ouse. It is a Gollywog emporium
and a continuous bazaar stall for gifts.' The
attendants are all leisured women who are
playing at shop-girl gratis, and the results
are to help invalided Australians. Small
boy scouts and some small girls from the
Training Home help as messengers and kids-
©f-all-work. A sixpenny tea-room lurks
behind the bazaar, and musical entertain-
ments supplied by amateurs attract restless
khaki men with no engagements on hand.
Yours sincerely.

RHEUMATISM AGAIN.
.Many people who had rheumatism last
winter are beginning to feel the aches and
pams of the complaint again. It is typical
of rheumatism that it usually lies dormant
during the summer, only to appear with
renewed vigor in winter. The dregs of the
complaint have been in the system all the
time. Victims will continue to suffer year
after year unless the cause is completely
eliminated from the system. Acid in the
blood is believed to be the cause of rheu-
matism, and medical men have noted that
there is a marked and rapid thinning of the
blood during the attacks. The system is
thus deprived of its natural resistance to
the disease. Much success has followed
treatment of rheumatism with Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills, and sufferers who have
treated themselves with this medicine have
found that, rheumatism has been perma-
nently banished and did not return with
the next cold, damp weather. These pills
have a specific action on the blood, increas-
ing and enriching it, and they tone up the
whole system, enabling it to throw off the
poisonous impurities that cause rheumatism.
•n Ur °wn chemist can supply you with these
pills, {sufferers from rheumatism can obtain
a handy booklet on “Diseases of the Blood”
by'sending their names and addresses to the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney.*
Troublesome Constipation.
Sufferers from constipation know from ex-
perience that after temporary relief has been
obtained by the use of a purgative, the con-
oition . often becomes worse. Most strong
purgatives have a tendency to cause con
stipation after their immediate effects are
over. Pinkettes, the new laxative, are a real
help m correcting the. irregularity. Tli-y
do not wear out in their effects, and taken
according to directions the patient will find
that they soon help to create a healthy regu-
lanty. They are. a safe family medicine
because they contain no liabit-creating drug •
they are daintily got up ; are easily given to
children, and they act thoroughly without
causing sickness and griping. Send for a
free trial sample to the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Co., Sydney, mentioning The Bulletin.
linkettes are Is. a. bottle at all medicine

10 Shots in a post-card
at 500 Yards
The Ross .280 Rifle using the Ross Sport-
ing ammunition will group 10 shots in a rect-
angle the size of a post-card at 500 yards.
Try to equal this at 200 yards
with any other sporting rifle
and ammunition.
But its wonderful accuracy
is only one of the reasons why
you should carry a Ross .280
on your hunting trip.—Another
is the anchoring properties of
the Ross .280 Sporting Am-
munition with copper tube ex-
panding bullet. This projectile
delivers a smashing blow as it
expands in the body of your
quarry and fells the largest game
instead of allowing it to escape
and linger wounded in the bush
as happens so often with other
sporting bullets.

Non-SRid Tyres.
For the hard road—for the hoi pace—for the long
grind—for true economy and service.
The success of Firestone Tyres has proved that the motorist
can have comfort, safety and the “ most miles per shilling.”
Firestone Tyres are preferred because of highest quality at the least-
cost—as the greatest value, even though there are “cheaper*' tyres.
The rubber in them is supremely good. It has the quality of greatest heat-
resistance, of greatest wear endurance. Every Firestone Tyre contains an extra quantity
of this extremely good rubber.
The Non-skid lettering is an imprint of safety. On every -highway "of the world it
challenges the need of other anti-skid safeguards. It holds the standard for endurance
and economy. The letters prevent spin or skid in any direction, they radiate the heat
of road friction, insure perfect traction with gasoline economy, car-protection and
comfort beyond contradiction.

TO DEALERS.
Firestone Tyres are made by specialists in the largest
exclusive tyre factory in the world. This year’s Firestone
output has increased 78 per cent. Firestone are tyres of
greatest strength, sturdiness and safety—
for the Price of Only Ordinary Tyres.
Leading dealers everywhere endorse Firestone quality, and
motorists praise Firestone service.
A Firestone Representative—from
the factory at Akron, Ohio, U.S.A.—
will shortly make calls on dealers and garages In person. Inter-
ested people may make appointments by writing to Firestone

The Inky Way.
“Gus Gosh”: The first Australian Inky
Wayfarer to return home damaged from
Turkey was Blake Young, of the Adelaide
Register. A bullet, which entereu one side
of the throat and emerged from the other,
paved the way for pneumonia. Altogether
eight of the Register staff went to sub-edit
the Turk. Young is a son of A. 11., of the
'Tiber, and of Mrs. .Jeanne F., who for-
merly divided her spare time between con-
tributing to the Register and carrying on
the late Catherine Helen Spence’s propor-
tional representation work. Lately she has
been more busy in seeing that the Holy
City does its fair share in supplying ambu-
lances.
* * * *
The S. M. Herald discovered an anony-
mous bard the other day, and printed on its
leader page some verses entitled “The Roll
Call,” “sent in by a soldier, who wishes his
name to be secret, from Egypt.” The fur-
ther information was offered that the self-
effacing soldier had stopped one or two bul-
lets. Alas, the verses had appeared in the
Melbourne Argus three months before, con-
tributed by “Oriel.” Sad to reflect that a
hero should be villain enough to take down
a simple-minded journal like the S. M.
Herald.
* * * *
“Jink”: Newspaperdom in Christchurch
(M.L.) is gasping hard for breath. The
Star, which has the habit of making itself
heard every evening, got on to a story about
a soldier’s widow who was in financial
trouble, and it sent a reporter to
talk to her. The reporter copied a nasty
letter sent her by the local Patriotic Com-
mittee and published it with an article urging
her claims. This started other letters, and
finally the Patriotic Committee discussed the
matter. The talk was duly reported, the
committee’s remarks being decidedly unfav-
orable to the widow. The widow’s lawyer
immediately fired a writ at the Star claim-
ing £5OO for libel, using the first article as
the basis of her action. After a two days'
sitting, in which plaintiff’s counsel with
great spirit asked the jury to “order these
newsmongers to keep their hands off soldiers'
widows w r hen their husbands were lying on
the slopes of Gallipoli with Turkish bullets
in ’em,” the stolid 12 awarded her £250, in
spite of a summing-up by the Judge in favor
of the newspaper. The Star has solemnly
sworn that it will now give up the vicious
habit of helping lame dogs and poor lone
widows, and will stick to giving the Kaiser
beans.
* # * *
One German industry that will be killed
by the war is the “Tauchnitz edition” of
English books. Australia does not see much
of them, because they cannot be brought
here except as smuggled goods, but all over
the Continent of Europe they appeal to the
British and American tourists. Old Baron
Tauchnitz, who started the idea about 1840,
was so fair-minded that he paid the authors
whose work lie appropriated, though copy-
right law then did not compel it; but he is
only a name now, and the name is going to
be fatal to the trade. So Louis Conard, a
Parisian publisher, lias jumped in, and pro-
poses to annex the whole business.
“Austin Biff”: Re skirts controlling
printeries. Mortlake (Vic.) Despatch is
complied, edited and etceteraed by two
women. In their establishment the usual
indescribable chaos is conspicuous by its
non-existence. Up till the time I met that
office I thought it was the First Command-
ment, handed down by the first father of the
first chapel, that all printeries should be in
an everlasting state of “pie.” Probably it
was; but Eve naturally found the Forbidden
much more pleasant. And, as in the Begin-
ning, I agree with her.
* * * *
“Foe”: What a cursed substance is wood-
pulp ! The cable says that some escaped
Italians who were forcibly employed by
the Germans in an explosive factory in the
Duchy of Baden have brought the news
that the Huns, being short of cotton, are
making nitro-cellulose out of trees. So in
times of peace the forest is made into cheap
literature to addle our brains, while in
time of war it is ground into powder to
blow them out.

An old N.S.W. journalist, Allen Campbell
Wood, died in his native town, Yass, a few
days back, aged 67. He was formerly pro-
prietor and editor of the Courier, published
in his birthplace, and was connected with
almost every local institution, from the
church to the race club.
THE LAST HORROR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
l-'aitb, Hope and Charity hail (lied,
Or so it seemed to me,
As I sat down my desk beside
Before some stone-cold tea.
And all the ghosts I had defied
Enjoyed my misery.
I don’t know what had burst my dream
And let Life’s joy run out,
But in my sky there was no gleam,
And all was fear and doubt.
And, as I said before, the team
Of ghosts sat round about.
I had no friend in all the world ;
I sat apart, alone;
1 was as one who had been hurled'
Into a Hell of stone.
The standard of my life seemed furled,
My fortune skin and bone.
Death seemed a boon too good to crave
For one in such a mess;
I do not think a galley-slave—
That symbol of distress—
E’er yearned as I did for the grave
And its forgetfulness.
And so at all I sneered and sniped,
And deemed I’d plumbed Despair,
While Thought’s sly devils leaped and piped.
But I had more to bear,
For lo 1 a poet came and wiped
His hot hands on my hair!

BEST for CHILDREN
and Grown Folk too.
Many children who thrive in summer are retarded in their healthy
development by a succession of coughs and colds through the winter
months. Some mothers think it cannot be avoided, and let the colds run
their course, stealing the roses from the children’s cheeks and enfeebling
the little limbs. The little bodies are racked w T ith coughs, the throats
strained, and the lungs receive injuries that sometimes last through life.
Only a cold, but the little one recovers slowly its liveliness and bloom.
It catches cold more easily after each attack. The child’s cold requires
intelligent treatment, and the careful mother cuts short its course by
timely use of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery. A few doses relieve the con-
gestion and cool the fevered head, the little throat becomes comfortable,
the coughing stops. Soon the child is itself again, and the system has no
strain from which to recover.
SAFEGUARDS the HOME
With Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to rely upon the mother need have
no fear, for winter’s ills are kept away from her child, and steady develop-
ment may go on as in the summer months. Should the children contract
whooping cough, Dr. Sheljlon’s New Discovery can be relied upon to alle-
viate the attacks of coughing, and to cut short the duration of the disease.
With measles, the only treatment is to keep the child warm in bed, and
give regular doses of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to control the cough.
There will he no after effects from measles if Dr. Sheldon’s New Dis-
covery is used according to directions. In sudden attacks of croup, the
dose must he repeated at more frequent intervals, when relief will come
quickly, and ever afterwards when the child appears the least croupy the
attack can be cut short by the prompt use of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
It is a powerful remedy, but contains no narcotics or poisons of any
kind, and mothers from all parts of Australasia joyfully testify and delight
to tell all the world how Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery has saved their
children.
DR. SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY is tho quickest, safest and
best known remedy for Coughs, Colds, Pleurisy, Bronchitis
and all Throat and Chest Troubles. It is the remedy that can
always be relied upon. It is obtainable everywhere at 1/6, and
in larger bottles, holding two and a half times as much, at 3/-

The Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, happy you who came to-day
A-down that old, enchanted way,
With nought but joy for load ;
M hat saw you as you travelled by,
From dawn to dusk, beneath the sky
Upon the Long South Road?
bile yet the world was dim and chill,
And every singing bird was still,
I saw six stars in an amber sky.
Each merry star with a twinkling eye,
Watching until the conquering sun
His race exultant had begun,
And wide his oriflamme had spread
Above the hills of dawn. Blood-red
Lapped every wavelet on the sand,
And upwards from the dewy land
There leapt that feathered lute, the lark,
To mock with song the routed dark.
The blithesome chorus of the morn,
Bell-like, on every wind was borne ;
The fern with myriad gems was hung,
And wayside spiders deftly flung
Their jewelled nets on twig and spray
To garnish well the winding way ;
And there was laughter in the breeze,
And joy upon the budding trees
As I came down. And then—and then,
As I passed through the dusky glen,
I met a maid so pale and sweet,
Who passed on swift and silent feet;
And by the fragrance in the air,
And by the blossoms in her hair,
Untold I knew indeed that she
Who trod the earth so soundlessly,
This lissom, lightsome, lovely thing,
Could be no other than the Spring!
And so I fell aside and followed her,
And as she hastened through the dewy grass
The tender ferns uncurled to watch her pass.
Aloft she tossed her shining, yellow hair,
And where it touched the branches overhead
The golden kowhai blooms their radiance
shed.
Bhe pressed her finger-tips on leafy trails,
And like a starry garland on the trees
The clematis swayed whitely in the breeze.
1 followed, followed still by winding ways,
J'o where, within the forest’s deepest gloom,
She kissed the rata vines to scarlet bloom.
She sped along the highway to the town,
And where she looked on flowerless garden
beds
Blue violets uplifted scented heads.
Bare orchard boughs bent low to see her
come,
And stole the roseate wonder of her face
To lend them loveliness a little space.
And then she paused, and sang for very joy,
And like an echo came the dulcet notes
Clear-ringing from a thousand wild-birds’
throats.
I crept to touch her where she stood
Between the river and the wood.
But she \vas gone. The quickening earth
Had swift forgotten winter’s dearth.
Each poplar in the little town
Had donned anew an emerald gown,
And by the lake the willow trees
Strung slender pennants in the breeze ;
And suddenly it seemed to me
The wide world sang in harmony
A deep, ecstatic, speechless song,
That filled my ears the whole day long ;
And even when the skies had paled,
And graciously the white moon sailed
Among the stars, I heard that strain
Ascend again and yet again,
Until the earth and sky and sea
Were swept with wondrous melody;
But you, who heard it not, will say
That out upon the road to-day,
Among the fields and trees and streams
I visions saw r , and dreamed wild dreams:
Yet nought can scoff the truth away,
That firing and I both came to day
A-down the Long White Road.

Roughing It.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MOUNTED Oil my bay mare Judy, and
leading my other bay mare Julia. I
left the Mooni River for Charleville.
a journey of 300 miles.
At St. George, qn the Balonue, I picked
up “Little Peter,” who also had two horses,
and we became mates.
As his pet. name implies he was a person
of limited proportions, .but innocent of the
usually correlative defects of self-estimated
greatness and magnificent conceit. He wasn’t
much of a talker, but he smoked prodigiously,
and asked for a match pretty often —just to
show there was no coolness arising between
us. Occasionally he would bridge two five-
mile silences with a bushman’s song:—
I’m makin’ out where the diggers go,
Where the reefs run deep an’ wide;
I’ll wet my whistle at Tally-ho,
An’ I’ll yard me a Western bride.
If th’ tracks are barren this moke I’ve got
Will do with a . rnulga tree.
An’ th’ hobble-chains an’ the old quart-pot
Still jingle a tune to me.
. We spent a few pleasant days at Mitchell,
on the Maranoa. It possessed a happy com-
bination that appealed to us—fruit, running
water and jolly girls ; also there was good
picking among the cypress pine _on the sand-
hill for Judy and Julia.
About every third night a dance was held
in the hall, and as the girls were scarce
Peter and I had a glorious time whilst some
of the youthful locals stood outside, squint-
ing round the door-post or peeping through
the window, and making scurrilous remarks
about our boots and general get-up.
“They’re always like that,” said one of the
gills. “They won't come in themselves, and
they hate to see a stranger dancing with us.
When we want partners we have to drag
them in. They’re too slow to catch grubs.”
After many months of wandering about
the bush, mixing only with men, we were in
prime condition to appreciate a whirl round
with buxom little lassies in our arms. We
held them tight—we hugged them; if the
lights had gone out we would have kissed
them. We bought them caramels and choco-
lates and silk handkerchiefs, and before the
day of departure came we had got down to
our last shilling. Ninepence of it was in
my pocket, and threepence in Peter's. But
we’d had a good time, and didn’t mind.
We also had a slight brush with the law
at Mitchell. I was reading in the tent when
two mounted troopers pulled up at my front
door.
“Ilulloa !” said one, a sandy-bearded Irish-
man. “What ’ave we got ’ere at all, at allV '
He came closer and peered in. llis com-
panion rode on. “Come out ’ere till I ’ave a
look at ye,” he said. I sat up. “Come arn
—if you’re not too lazy !”
I stepped out, trying at the same time to
recall what I had been doing. I had not been
drunk and disorderly. I had not committed
assault. I had not coveted my neighbor’s
property—nor his wife. I had no recollec-
tion of having murdered anybody. So far as
I knew I was a law-abiding citizen
“Have ye a cut on your head?” he asked
after scanning me closely.
"I haven’t.”
“Take your hat off.”
I did so. He turned and twisted in his
saddle to scrutinise me.
“Sure, it’s not ye’self that has th’ cut
head,” he said. “But p'raps th’ cut was
only a scratch. Turn round an’ lift your coat
a trifle.”
"What's the meaning of all this?” I
objected.' He was obdurate.
"Lift your coat, an’ don’t be cheeky." I
obeyed. “Faith !” lie said, “it’s not ye’self
that’s been stuck on a palin’. Were ye up
town last night?”
“I was not.”
“Ye’re wan av tlr good boys, so. Good-
ma ruin’.”
“Am I not entitled to an explanation?” I
cried after him. “What have I done to be
treated like this?”
“Ye’ve been tlirated so to prove that ye’ve
done nothing,” he answered, and away lie
rode.
Peter, who had been “seeing to the horses,”
returned shortly afterwards, talking loudly of
suing the law for insulting behavior. The
cosherman had met him among the pine trees
and subjected him to the same humiliating
treatment.
We went up to the newsagent and made in-
quiries. It transpired that a man had been
detected in a robbery at the railway sta-
tion, and while expeditiously scaling a fence
the bulge of his nether garment caught on
top of a paling, where he was detained long
enough to be marked for future identification.
We decided to leave Mitchell while our pants
were untorn.
The traveller with a swag is always made
to regret the happening of anything crimi-
nal, especially a murder. If he shows
up in a disturbed district while the hue and
cry is on he at once becomes a suspect. Weak-
minded people rush inside at sight of him
and barricade the doors, whilst other luna-
tics fly to the telephone and call the police in
frenzied, broken gasps. He is dogged and
waylaid and variously persecuted at every
turn; while innocently boiling his billy under
a gum-tree he is suddenly surprised by a
rush of bobbies, “laid on” by idiotic residents,
who cover him with guns and roar at him to
bail up. The police cause might be materi-
ally helped if some hoodlums could develop
enough common-sense to reason that a man
is not necessarily a scoundrel because he
carries a swag.
Peter rode away in a melancholy mood.
1 lalf-way across Mitchell Downs he re-
marked : “She was just gettin’ nice an’
familiar,” and lapsed into silence again.
We had wet weather and heavy travelling
all the way to Each day was
begun with a wet tramp Mter horses, and
each evening, after pitching the tent, we had
to excavate a canal round it to carry off the
surplus wetness, and strip bark to make our
naps on.
At Tyrconnel we had to swim a flooded
creek to get the horses. We rode 28 miles
that day, via Dolvadilla, and camped near
Morven. This place was originally known as
Saddler’s Waterholes, and was one of the
oldest bush camping-grounds for teamsters in
southern Queensland. Here we spent all next
day looking for Judy and Julia, and found
them at sundown —in a patch of scrub only
half a mile from camp. 'Judy, in rolling, had
filled the bell with mud. I had strained my
ear over miles of damp scenery to catch its
musical tinkle, and was taking a straight cut
back to camp when I chanced on the wan-
derer.
“Rather too late to make a start now,” I
said on returning.
Peter picked up the billycan and went
towards the gully, singing:—
“Well, mate,” seel William, “I thought it out,
An’ I sez to myself, sez I:
There’s not much hope for the rouseabout,
As th’ rousy can testify”
“We’ll stop till mornin’,” he called out
from the bottom of the gully. Half-way
back with the water he broke out again :—•
I'll roll my swag when the sun gets up,
An’ I'll camp when the sun goes down.
The Warrego was running a banker. The
whole country was flooded, and the blatant
voices of frogs greeted us as we swam a wide
billabong to get into Charleville. The town
is noted for its omnipresent herds of goats,
and as the rendezvous of carriers and travel-
lers of all denominations.
It has a choice variety of mosquito (a first-
cousin to the Hexham Greys, of Newcastle,
N.S.W.), which suck blood till they burst.
It has a formidable trunk, this vampire,
which defies any kind of clothing or blanket.

The Home First-Aid
ZAM-BUK HEALS ALL SORTS OF SORES
AND SUPERFICIAL INJURIES.
Accidents will happen in the best-regulated
families, and the necessity of keeping a reliable
first-aid for home use cannot be too strongly i
insisted upon.
Where a pot of Zam-Buk is kept on a handy shelf,
no member of the family is at a loss in emergency
The breadwinner dresses his injuries with Zam-Buk
and knows that its powerful antiseptic action will
clean out the wound, preventing suppuration or
poisoning. The housewife flies to the useful
little pot for her bruises, cuts and burns, and
the little ones cry out for Zam-Buk when
they fall, because they know it will soothe
smarting pain.
Zam-Buk is a powerful healing balm,
cleverly combined and concentrated, and
wonderfully refined. Many modern pre-
parations contain quantities of animal fats
and mineral poisons, and are not only irri-
tating and unreliable, but tend to create
the very complications which should be
guarded against.
The Zam-Buk way is both different and
superior. This natural healing balm takes
out the smart and soothes the pain, reduces
the inflammation and induces a clean healing
right away. It kills microbes, nullifies the
effects of dirt or poisonous substances, and
finally helps Nature to build up new tissue to '
replace that which has been damaged or destroyed.

EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
A MOTHER’S PRAISE FOR ZAMBUK
“ We Have Never Known It Fail.”
Mrs. Crimmings, Forsyth and Penshurst Streets, Willouglibv
North Sydney,' says:—“A tin of boiling- water burst all
over the face and shoulders of my little boy, Joe.
One side of his face swelled out into an enormous
blister, which broke and left, the surface in a raw
state. We dressed the injury with Zam-Buk,
which healed his face in a week or two.
“Again, this boy cut his leg severely with a
piece of broken bottle. Zam-Buk once more
came to the reseue, and quickly healed the injury.
“My little girl, Kathleen, had an eruption
of sores on her head. She lost most of her
hair. Commencing with Zam-Buk the sores
gradually disappeared until her scalp
was clean and health'- strain.
“We have used Zam-Buk on
many occasions, and never known
it fail.”
Zam-Buk, the ever-ready healing:
balm, is unsurpassed for eczema,
ringworm, bad iegrs, festering:
wounds, piles, as well as a quick
healer of cuts, burns and skin
injuries. Sold by all stores and

doubtful veracity assured me that the abomi-
nations had teeth also.
"1 saw a blamed queer thing one day,” lie
continued as he spat through the smoke.
“ ’Twas a skeeta on a log a-beltin’ an' a-roll-
in’ of his trunk with his hind leg. Couldn’t
make out wot was the matter with him till a
blacksmith comes along. ‘Why,’ ses he, ‘that
skeeta wants ter reach something an’ his
trunk ain’t long enough. He’s a. drorin’ of
it out.' Wal, 1 watches, an’ by-’n’-bye he
darts for my boot. There was a crack in the
uppers, an’ In' sticks his trunk through an’
bores into me prince alberts till lie ’ad half
his head buried. Rut that trunk warn’t long
enough yet. So back he goes to the log, an’
he pulls at it, an’ rolls it, an’ joggles the
concern, to draw it out some more. Then it
commenced to rain, an’ I left.”
The greatest annoyance we experienced in
the neighborhood was from the sandflies,
which appear in swarms immediately after
floods. They were particularly bad in the
mornings, and from near sundown till dark.
At these times the horses about the town
would be frantic from stings, and there was
a continual clang and jingle of bells as they
galloped madly about the bush. If not
watched they travelled for miles in their
efforts to escape from the torment.
We found it necessary to keep smoky fires
continually burning—by lopping trees and
feeding with green bushes. The horses would
stand in the thick smoke, head to tail, for
hours. Now and again they would venture
away on a trial, and dart back again at the
first attack.
There was one bob-tailed horse there, and
lie hadn’t a friend in the district. No other
animal would associate with him. lake the
Chinaman with the shorn pigtail he had lost
caste. Now and again a strange horse would
drop in and pair with him. Presently
Stranger, who would be lashing Bobby all
the time with his tail, would begin' to look
round and wonder. The sandflies were sting-
ing him badly. What the deuce was Bobby
doing? It would become unbearable, and
Stranger would turn round and examine
Bob’s anatomy. Then, seeing he had been
imposed upon, he'd put his ears back, wheel
round, and lash out like fury. I pitied poor
Bobtail, and wondered who had robbed him
of his hereditary fly whisk.
Sometimes during the day the horses would
wander two or three miles away, and on the
appearance of the pest would return at full
gallop, with a deafening bell-clatter, to the
camp. There were at least 50 smoke fires
constantly going in the vicinity, and the
horses got mixed up among them, as they
generally made for the nearest. Thus every-
body called on everybody else pretty fre-
quently in doing the rounds of the smokes,
inquiring for his horses.
When the unfortunate animals stayed out
too long they would come in dripping with
blood. The chest and underparts suffered
most: while the eyes of some were bunged
up, lips and nostrils swollen, and the body
covered with little lumps and blotches. Con-
stant rubbing to relieve the irritation caused
o. loss of hair from mane and tail, and along
the back and rump, giving them the appear-
ance of having passed through a severe
attack of mange.
The sandflies disappeared at nightfall.
Then the mosquito with the long trunk “made
things willing” till it was time for the other
fellow to come on watch and hunt up a
breakfast. There was a respite during the
middle of the day, which we spent climbing
trees and lopping branches in preparation for
the onslaught.
After being flood-bound for ten days at
Charleville I started up the Warrego alone
with the intention of doing a boomerang jour-
ney until the country dried a bit. It was
Thursday morning. The river was still
swollen, and my only hope of getting over
was to risk crossing the unfinished Charle-
ville bridge. There was a four-feet drop at
the far side and the decking was slippery.
Two horses had been crippled there that
morning, and lay on the opposite bank.
I got a bag and spread it on the planks, so
that the hind hoofs would stand on the centre
of it. Then I led Judy across. She dropped
down very gently, and with a short, quick
jump landed safely. I had barely led her out
of the way when Julia, the pack-mare, who
couldn’t bear to be parted from her mate,
came after us. She dropped down all right,
but the old fool stood there—her hindquart-
ers up in the air. The pack, having no sur-
cingle, and the saddle being held on with only
one small girth, toppled over on to her neck.
Down she went on her head, then turned a
turtle that saved her life, and elicited a roar
of laughter from the bridge-men. Her look
of offended dignity when she got up was
almost human. She blew her nose hard and
often, and rubbed a heap of river-bank out
of her eyes on Judy’s tail.
Friday.—Spent eight hours horse-hunting,
and returned to my camp at the Twenty-
seven Mile with empty bridles. Many horses
were pasturing there, and as I had not
studied the shape and marks of Judy’s and
Julia’s hoofs, it was impossible to track
them. My anxiety at this stage was tre-
mendous, for it was likely the sandflies had
driven them away.
That same evening I walked . down to
Cowrie out-station, eight miles. No one
there had seen anything of Judy and Julia.
Waited till a beast was killed, and got some
fresh meat. It was then dusk. My legs
were chafed and my heels blistered as I
began that eight-mile walk—over sand-hills
and boggy flats —back to a wet camp. It
took me five hours —the hardest and weariest
journey of my life. I spread my nap and
lay down to rest while the billy boiled. Cot
cold and stiff, and had to crawl to the fire
on hands and knees to make the tea.
Saturday.—By chance I struck Nive Junc-
tion, a small squattage in ruins, and buried
in a wilderness of cypress pine, rank grass
and bushes. The only hands were a mar-
ried couple. The manager was a grass-
widower, a dapper little bank clerk, who
was endeavoring to pick up some bush experi-
ence among the pine trees when I met him.
“Any chance of a jobl asked, after
making fruitless inquiries about my horses.
“Ever do any fencing—repairing wire
fences?” lie queried. .
“Miles of it,” I said. R ire fencing is
mv specialty.” .
’“Well, 1 want a man to repair a lot oi
fencing that’s been washed down by the
floods. Let me see —to-morrow’s Sunday.

nine o’clock every morning. You leave off
at one on Saturday.”
1 thanked him and departed, making a
deviation on my way back in the hope of
dropping across Judy and Julia. But my
luck was dead out. .V ragged tramp had
possession of my camp, and was griddling
the remains of my meat on a bit of twisted
wire.
Ilis own camp had caught fire a few days
before, and he had lost everything but what
he stood in. “All me forty-years’ gatherin’
gone into smoke, an’ none of it insured,” he
said regretfully. Having no more conveni-
ent place to deposit himself after the con-
flagration, he had sat on a log and was
promptly bitten by a scorpion. He still
felt the effects of the sting, and wanted to
stop about the crossing so that somebody
could find him if he began to die. If he
recovered he was going to the diggings on
the Roper River to get a million pounds’
worth of gold that was in the ground there.
He was barefooted, and was looking for
someone who had a pair of boots to give
away.
“Been bare-footed long?” I asked.
“Only since the fire,” he answered. “In
most parts,” he went on, “when a settler’s
burnt out, it’s the custom to get up a sub-
scription for him. Three families that I
might consider my neighbors for the time
were livin’ within a mile or two o’ where I
pitched me camp. They were all sorry to
hear of my misfortune when I told ’em, but
none of ’em sent the hat round. ’Twarn’t
neighborly.”
“Did you mention the scorpion?” I asked.
“I did,” he replied, “but they said that
needn’t alarm me, as tli’ bite wasn’t always
fatal.”
Sunday.-—Hunting for horses all the morn-
ing. Searched the sandhills, and followed a
great many gohauna tracks. Found nothing
more important at the end of them than a
hole in the sand. Tracking gohannas is
wearisome. They go such a long way,
and wobble like tanglefoot. The man the
scorpion bit came along, and I set him dig-
ing up the holes with an improvised yam
stick. He got a black beetle and two centi-
pedes. lie also got tired; and likewise
hungry.
We might have caught a fish with less
trouble, but I preferred a carnie. It is a
delicacy much relished by overlanders. It
is also known as the sand gohanna, from its
habit of burrowing in the sand. It is much
smaller and of a lighter color than the com-
mon gohanna or lace lizard. The stump
lizard and the frilled lizard —the chap with
the Vandyke collar and mouth like a young
tank —are somewhat similar in flavor.
I was giving up the search in despair when
I happened across one near camp. Roasted
it on the coals and made a hearty meal.
The man the scorpion bit was down the river
chopping white grubs out of trees. He
came back after dinner, with yellow stains
trending downwards from each corner of his
mouth, showing that the grubs had been fat
and juicy.
I put my two saddles and swag into a bag,
and with this over my shoulder started for
the squattage at four o’clock. The whole
weighed about lcwt. Half-way up a heavy
storm caught me, and the rain for awhile was
blinding. A long black-soil flat stretched
before me. Where the grass saved me from
bogging the stuff adhered to the soles of my
boots, in thick layers of mud and grass.
Jerking this off by vigorous kicks partially
dislocated my legs. It was like walking on
stilts, with feet of lead.
My swag, which was sopping wet, had
increased twofold in weight. It was all the
more irksome as each foot slipped back six
inches at every step. Then there were
alternate sheets of Water to wade through,
with the inevitable swish-swosh in my boots
afterwards. Though I was wet to the skin,
the perspiration streamed off me.
When I reached the slip-panels near the
homestead I espied my strayed property
under a tree. I addressed some remarks to
them, applicable under the circumstances,
which no paper would print. Then I drove
them into the paddock.
Steady rain fell all next day, so I had
plenty of time to cook and “put things in
order.” My hut was Sft. x 10ft., with slab
walls, bark roof, and floor composed of ashes,
sand and mullock. It stood on the bank of
the Nive River, surrounded by a cluster of
trees, long grass and undergrowth. The
male part of the married couple recommended
it as a nice quiet place: and it was casually
mentioned that several snakes had been killed
in and around it. They were an ugly variety
of snake, dirty green in color, as thick as a
shovel handle, and grew to a length of Oft.
While frying some flapjacks I heard a
noise in a square iron tank which had been
thrown on its side behind the galley. Armed
with the fire-shovel, I stepped cautiously over
and peered in. The inmate wasn’t a snake;
it was the man the scorpion bit. lie was
crouched in a corner, naked, his knees under
his chin. His clothes, tied in a bundle,
rested on his thighs.
“What are you doing there?” I demanded?
“I come in out of tli’ wet,” he answered,
crawling out.
“And what did you take your clothes off
for ?”
“To keep ’em dry. They’re the only togs
I’ve got.”
“Better step inside and put them on,” I
advised. “It’s not respectable to be going
about like that.”
Ilis dress consisted of a shirt with no
buttons on, a pair of patched pants (one leg
of which was torn off at the knee), and a
holey concavity that used to be a hat. When
he had put everything on, and fastened
the shirt with a two-incli nail, and
tied a bit of rope round himself for
a belt, his appearance suggested a
sick crow in a storm. I gave him
a feed and a shake-down. Next morning he
got rations at the store and left for the
Roper. At Augathella an unsympathetic
policeman took him in charge for not having
enough sense to travel with. He had been
going round with the hat on behalf of II
imaginary settlers, all of whom had been
burnt out and subsequently bitten by scor-
pious,
