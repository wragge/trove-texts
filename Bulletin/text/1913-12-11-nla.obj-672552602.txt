“ Not like others,” In fact, there’s no roofing like Halthoid—no
roofing so good. Malthoid does not rust, chip, crack nor break, and
whenjt’s properly laid it stays laid, despite storms and winds and
weathers of all sorts. You can’t say that of most other roofings. If
you are not familiar with the good points of Malthoid we’d like to
send the nearest Malthoid man to have a yarn to you. What

The Red Page
The Rymbel
This page, which has given shelter to sev-
eral new members of the numerous Poetry
family, such as the Reversolet and the Mir-
audaley, welcomes from America the
modest Ilymbel. This new species was dis-
covered by the Century. It is said that
the father of the Rymbel was a Jingle, and
its mother a Rondel. The result of this
marriage was a feeble-minded daughter, Sym-
bol by name, and four “wanting” sons,
Ramble (the eldest), Rondeau and Rime
(the twins), and Jumble, the baby. The
family is collectively called the Rymbels.
Roughly speaking, a rymbel is any poem of
two, four or six stanzas, preferably of five
lines each, in which the ultimate word in
one verse must inevitably be a miscue for
the subject-matter of the next. “Whenever
Mr. Rymbel embarks upon the first verse.
Mrs. Rymbel, because of her deafness and
lightness of mind, seizes upon the most un-
expected meaning embodied in the last word
of her husband’s verse, and proceeds pro-
perly to mangle it in the second, after which
the children take up the tangled skein, and
do a little mangling on their own.” That
is the. diagnosis of the Ilymbel-discoverers in
America : but. as will be seen from an ex-
ample of. Rymbelling printed in the Century,
the classification of the idiosyncrasies of this
curious family is inaccurate. Here Carolyn
Wells rymbels : •
Full winsome was her bonny face,
And eke her golden hair.
Her gown was weft of rarest lace ;
And high aloft, with gentle grace,
A sunshade pink she bare.
The She Bear from the forest came,
Just why, I cannot state.
The creature seemed to be quite tame;
Methought, would I her favor claim,
I must ingratiate.
In grey she ate! The lunch was fair—
We had a window seat.
Her grey gown meek, yet debonair ; —-
Demure —yet with a regal air—
She looked imperial—sweet.
“Imperial suite? Yes, I dare say
’Twould make our voyage gladder,”
, My wife was mad about display—
But when I mentioned what we’d pay,
It only made Rose madder !
Rose madder—’tis the tint I’d use
To paint my brain's fair figment;
A shape, half goddess and half muse,
And all in misty, pinkish hues,
. The color scheme —the pigment.
- The color scheme the pig meant ? Ma’am,
That was a subtle fancy !
In tints of dawning gooseb’ry jam,
And those soft pinks of early ham,
We painted little Nancy !
This sort of thing may delight New York;
but it is evident that Carolyn Wells has
mute failed to understand the Rymbel. The
Rymbel must mean something: it must not
be a mere farrago of loose-jointed nonsense.
This page, therefore, before admitting the
Rymbel to intimacy with such reputable
members of the Poetry family as the Rever-
solet and the Mirandaley, has insisted upon
a tighter definition .of its meaning.
Thus, the Australian Rymbel (copyright)
is a poem of from three ,to six stanzas, each
of five lines, in which the last word in the
first stanza must begin the next stanza, but
in another sense, on the analogy of a pun.
The last word in the Succeeding stanzas must
similarly begin the next succeeding verses,
and (important point), the last word of the
last stanza must be the first syllable or word
of the first verse, also used in a different
tense, thus binding the loose-limbed and
rattly Rymbel family together. And the
whole Rymbel must treat of only oife sub-
ject.
A rough example of such a Rymbel, com-
piled by The Bulletin’s Rambling
Rymbeller. follows :
Rymbel, welcome, little girl!
Site’s the .Muses’ latest pet.
Mrs. Sonnet was her mother,
Mr. Pantoum her brother,
And her sister, Triolet.
Try 1 Oh, let us try to learn
All her meaning, neat and terse.
If a pun was her ancestor,
Poets happily have dressed her
In a gjfllant robe of verse.
Versatility we need.
Like a convict-gang of crime,
Each verse follows close his brother,
Linked with shackles to each other,
And the chains are made of rime.
It will be noticed that the connecting rimes
are triolet —try! oh, let; Verse —vers(-atil-
ity) p'and rime—Rym (-bel). This was
merely rymbelled by the Office Rymbeller in
a ribald mood. We expect that, once accli-
matised, the Rymbel will flourish in Aus-
tralia. A guinea is offered for the best
Rymbel submitted to this page by January
31, 1914.
The Way of the Novel
In its fiction supplement the London
Times attempts to sum up the tendencies of
this year’s fiction. It is curious to note
that despite the roaring flood of fiction,
sweeping more widely and more swiftly each
year, one publisher estimates that he accepts,
on the average, only 13 manuscripts out of
every 500 submitted. How many people,
therefore, must there be futilely writing
novels? And the life of the novel is nowa-
days so short. After three months the aver- 1
asre novel is dead and damned, as far as its
publisher is concerned. If a novel lives
through a whole season its publisher regards
it as a success. It may be read in the circu-
lating libraries long after its early decease;
but the publisher knows that it hks to be
“slaughtered.” Off it goes to the Jewish
dealers in the East-end, bought by them for
one penny a volume, and hawked round the
country for whatever it will realise. Some-
times copies find rest in public libraries;
thousands of copies are shipped to us; the
rest is pulp and silence.
The ’best-sellers” of this year in Eng.ancl
are: Hall Caine, Farnol. Humphry Waul,
Maxwell, Barclay, Locke, Orezy, Bennett,
Wells, Parker, Hitchens, and Hugh Wal-
pole. A growing tendency is the insularity
of the English and the American reader —
each prefers his own native authors. We may
add that the same tendency is slowly becom-
i; a apparent in this continent : the Aus-
tralian book is finding a gradually increasing
sale in Australasia. The best English novels
are, in the opinion of The Times:—
The Passionate Friends. Bv H. G. Wells.
The Coryston Family. By Mrs. Humphry
Ward.
The Regent. By Arnold Bennett.
The Dark Flower. By John Galsworthy,
Sinister Street. (By Compton Mackenzie..
The Devil's Garden. By W. B. Maxwell.
The Morning's War. By C. E. Montague.
Bendish. By Maurice Hewlett.
All these authors are noticeably deficient
in form; several, like Wells, are shapeless.
The didactic novel, the “problem” novel, is
disappearing. “These authors of 1913 saw
the difference between a novel built round a
theorem and a novel from which a view of
conduct emerges.” And their outlook is pre-
ponderantly grey. • Nowadays there is not
only a specialisation of function among
novelists, but among readers. The writers
tend to run in grooves, to specialise in
their own departments, to keep safely
within their own limitations; and the
readers are annoyed if tame authors stray
from their beaten track. Judging from the
success of Hall Caine, it is evident that “a
religious flavor is found a palatable relish
to sexual extravaganza.”
j*
We take a fond farewell of Compton
Mackenzie, the admired author of Carnival.
It is in his Sinister Street (Bell, per
Dymock’s Library) that we part. Yet he
has himself only gone half-way: for Sinister
Street, though running to ,500 pages, has
still another half-thousand pages to go. Our
farewell Occurred mid-way in this volume,
when Mackenzie’s hero, having been elabo-
rately annotated and investigated by his
biographer from babyhood, had reached only
the Upper Fifth class in his school, and we
despaired ever of finding him a man, even
on the 1000th page. Thus Compton Mac-
kenzie, having written only half a story, is
entitled only to half a notice. lie asks
whether 1000 pages are too long for the
history of 25 years of a man’s life? And he
holds that “childhood makes the instrument,
youth tunes the strings, and early manhood
plays the melody.” But this critic wants
to hear the melody, and this author is such
a wearying time constructing his instrument,
and so interminably occupied in tuning its
strings that all possible enjoyment of the
melody has been destroyed.
If one were to write bis autobiography
fully, putting in every detail of his life, not
10,000 words would suffice; and at the last
page no clear picture of the hero would
emerge: he would be drowned beneath an
ocean of insignificant incident. Compton
Mackenzie’s method is not art: it is an
encyclopa?dia. Art means selection. Sinis-
ter Street is a diary in which .every day has
its uninteresting narrative. And yet the
author once wrote Carnival.
A highly interesting problem is treated
with high seriousness in The Devil’s Garden
(Hutchinson, per Dymock’s Library), by W.
B. Maxwell, the author of such excellent
books as In Cotton Wool and Mrs. Thomp-
son. A man, maddened by the discovery that
an old aristocrat had not only seduced the
girl he had married, but had forced her, to
save her husband from the loss of his billet,
to renew the acquaintanceship, murders the
old man. The murder is never discovered, and
Dale and his placid wife gradually become
lovers again, prosper and grow old in peace.
Then the murdefer, a man of 50, becomes
suddenly infatuated with a servant girl, who
makes no secret of the fact that she loves
him. He struggles against this obsession,
but sees that there is no escape for him. He
had long convinced himself that he had not
murdered, but executed, Barradine, the old
seducer of his wife —and now he found him-
self “a wretch who in wishings and cravings,
if not in accomplished facts, was as vile as
the man he had slain.” There was, there-
fore, but one thing for Dale, now a religious
man, to do: he must execute the same judg-
ment upon himself.
This apparently melodramatic plot enfolds
a work of sincere purpose and considerable
art. Maxwell’s method is pedestrian, with
infinite stress upon detail —detail, however,
that, unlike that of Compton Mackenzie, is
always significant. Dale, the rustic post-
master, a man of the soil who had slowly
made his way, retains always his ruggedness
of soul and his fine physique. When he dis-
covers that his placid wife, in order to save
him, had had to stay with the old seducer of
her youth in London, he horribly hammers
his wife. And, almost fondly examining her
bruises afterwards, the wife reflects :
“How he had knocked her about! Stand-
ing before the toilet glass, and looking at
her bruises musingly, she tried to remember
in what part of the room, and at which
period of the long volcanic discussion, each
one had been received. . . .Raising her eyes in
order to see if the lip and the eyebrow con-
tinued to mend satisfactorily, she was sur-
prised by the general expression of her face.
Positively she was smiling. The smile van-
ished at once, but jt had been there —a
gentle, melancholy, yet proud little smile.
And, reflecting, she understood that, deep in
her thoughts, there was truly pride when-
ever she dwelt upon her husband’s violence.
It did prove so conclusively how immense
was the love.”
nSuc we nave strayed trout Maxwell’s
method. 11 is discovery that his wife has
long been at the beck and call of the great
man is concealed, except to the careful
reader, until the moment of the explosion;
and, similarly, it is only at the right moment
toward the end of the book that we’ definitely
learn that he had killed liarradine. But
hints have been everywhsre discreetly
dropped while we read of the peaceful pro-
gress of his married life, the growing old
together of man aryl wife, long reconciled,
the birth of children, the benignant seasons
of placid happiness, the calm philosophy of
middle age, the increase of Dale’s religious
feelings, and his ultimate acceptance of the
Baptist faith. And thus, when the moment
comes for our enlightenment it is almost as
if referring to a thing understood and tacitly
accepted, that Maxwell tells us.
“When a man has reached a certain time
of life he must not crave for forbidden de-
lights, he must not permit himself to be
eaten up by new desire, he must not risk
destroying a girl’s soul for the gratification
of his own body. If he does, he commits the
unpardonable sin.... The Devil’s reasonings
to which a few minutes ago he had listened
greedily were specious, futile, utterly false.
That sort of argument might do for other
men —but it would not do for him, William
Dale. Its acceptance would knock the very
ground from under his feet.
“For, if there could be any excuse, why
had he killed Everard Barradine?”
Only then are we told the details of the
murder and of the long agony of fear that
Dale had controlled beneath his pas-
sive demeanor and his quiet life.
And, finally, we have the anguish of
a man’s deeply religious soul, as he
sees that his God had saved him from
hanging merely so that he should suffer a
worse punishment by living. That scene is
a curious one. Dale pictures the Trinity
individually. Christ had tried to save him,
but the other two persons of the Trinity
had interposed.
“Profound and sincere as was his reveren-
tial awe, he unhesitatingly translated all
the sublime mystery of the skies into the
simple terms that alone possess plain mean-
ing to man’s limited intelligence. ..He imag-
ined the First and the Third Persons of the
Trinity seated royally but vaguely amidst
the clouds. . . .two tangible concrete old men
—two venerable, wise old men —the
ultimate strained conception of two
powerful, honored, high-placed old men. And
they talked- —not in the human vocabulary
—about the man William Dale.” s
They were speaking of him at the period
when he had been baptised a Baptist. “God
the Father seemed to say that tie would hope
for the best; —although, as they Both knew,
Christ was too easily imposed upon. And
God the Holy Ghost pursed His lips, and
shook His head.... The Holy Ghost was
clean-shaven, very thin, with sharp, clearly-
cut features as of somebody who does not
enjoy robust health, and with a slight but
painful suggestion of a Roman Catholic
priest who habitually goes deep into private
secrets and is never really satisfied until he
has extracted the fullest possible confessions.
He was the One that Dale had never so much
cared about —the difficult member of the firm,
the sleeping partner who never really slept,
who professed to keep himself in the back-
ground, but who quietly asserted himself in
important moments and proved infinitely the
hardest of the Three.”
So while Christ pleaded for mercy, it was
the Holy Ghost who kept the books, and.
openihg “a large, strongly-bound volume,.”
produced his record. “Having committed the
crime, he had the calm audacity— to lay the
blame on Us. Yes, here is the entry. This is
the statement verbatiin : ‘lt is the finger of
God.’ ”
Dale knew he had no chance. But a sign
ultimately comes to his disordered mind that
assures him of forgiveness, and he is given
the chance of an heroic death.
Anyway, Compton Mackenzie has painted
the first portrait in literature of that diffi-
cult, but to us very vague, member of the
firm, the Holy Ghost. But the book is a
big book, admirably knit, sincerely written.
By the way, both these novels have been cen-
sored by an irresponsible body of tradesmen
in control of the chief subscription libraries
of a place called London. Mackenzie, let us
hope, was censored for his dulness; and
Maxwell, we presume, for his Holy Ghost.
And The Devil's Garden is now in its sixth
edition.
•
The reissue of Bohn’s celebrated library
at the modern price of one shilling (Is. 3d.
here) is a wonderful achievement in cheap-
ness. The volumes are .admirably produced
and handy in format: the type is clear
and the paper thin but opaque. The second
20 volumes of a series that contains hardly
any rubbish include Francis Burney’s
Early Diary (2 vols.), Carlyle’s French
Revolution (3 vols.). Emerson (2 vols.),
Tom Jones (2 vols), Marcus Aurelius, Mon-
taigne (3 vols.), L. von Ranke’s History of
the Popes (3 vols.), and Trollope’s The
Warden and Barchester Towers.
Australian Unity, by Aioeu Church. a
political woi-k dealing with the Unification
movement (Australian i’aper Co., Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney), is an example of the
wrong way to push a right ideal. The
book has the dull appearance of a Govern-
ment publication ; judging from the list of
errata it seems to have edited itself; it s
contents are arranged haphazard; its photo-
graphs and its make-up lack dignity and
despite the enthusiasm of its
the matter remains dull and difficult to die
tor. Ail the inconvertible arguments for the
policy of the Reconstruction movement are
set forth, but in language whose frenzy j s
unnecessary. The book shrieks for the hie
blue pencil even more loudly than Grant
Hervey shrieks. ... well, for various things
It'contains the policy of the Young Aus
tralian .National Party, the proposed new
Constitution for Australia, copies of various
foreign Constitutions, historical reviews
Grant Hervey’s “Rattle Hymn of the New
Australia, ’ a portrait of Grant Hervey
more poems by Grant Hervey....an article
by Grant Hervey. The facts —and a con-
siderable amount of rhetoric —are here but
a book a quarter of its size, with the argu-
ments condensed and the facts summarised
would reach the general Australian in a wav
that this publication will never do. Nothing
of course, can kill the movement for One
Australia for One People, but some of the
poems and some of the photographs in this
dull-looking blue book look like being guiltv
of manslaughter. Till a second edition, con-
densed and revised, is issued, the nationalist
in Australia must be content with this
Price, 2s. Gd.
The second volume of the uniform edition
of George Moore, Impressions and Opinions
(Laurie, 65.), will be welcomed, since the
first edition. George Moore delightedly tells
us. is so rare that for the printing of this
edition he found it would be necessary to
pay £2 10s. for a copy. But: ‘'lt would
have been distasteful for us to spend so
much money on our own writings. The
story got about, and the book was brought
to us one morning in a basket. Our but-
cher’s son had been collecting our writings
for some years, and had slipped it in with
the beef.” Moore warns the young .reader
that both Spring Days and the "present book
“are strictly in our first manner.” In his
preface Moore finds that “the literary humor
of the present time is always to sneer at
artistic accomplishment, and to praise the
rude and rough manifestations of untutored
genius. In the taste of the present day
Phidias is looked unon as being no better
than Turgueneff. Balzac has had his day
of favor, but is giving way to the more un-
cultivated imaginations of Dostoevsky,/Even
grammar is out of fashion; peasant speech
yields a richer flavor; and as we would win
by hook or by crook some of the popularity
of our great contemnoraries. we have not
corrected any mistakes, but tried to see
them as beauty spots.”
The first five volumes of a cabinet copy-
right edition of George Eliot’s novels, ad-
mirably printed, published by Blackwood at
Is. a volume, include The Mill on the Floss
(2 vols.). Silas Marner, and Adam Bede (2
vols.). This excellent cheap series will be
complete in 17 volumes, and the remaining
issues will be published within this year.
Carolyn Wells. in The Bookman
(U.S.A.), tries her facile hand of parody
upon the Cubists. The subject is that
famous picture, “A Nude Descending the
Staircase.” Shellev thus apostrophises it:
Hail to thee, blithe spirit!
Nude thou never tvert.
Not from Heaven or near it
Breathed thy cubic heart
In profuse stairs of unintelligible art....
We look before and after ,
And pine thy face to see;
Our sincerest laughter
Is aroused by thee.
Art thou, perchance the sad cube root of 28?
Passing over Kipling:—
On an old symbolic staircase,
Looking forty ways at once.
There's a Cubist Nude descending
With the queerest sort of stunts —
we reach Rossetti: —
The Blessed Nude at eve leaned out
From the gold staircase rail;
Her paint was deeper than the depth
Of waters in a pail.
She wore three bonnets on her heads,
And seven coats of mail....
There are others admirable, but "W ords-
worth most appeals :
She trod among the untrodden maze
Of Cubists on a spree;
A Nude ichen there icere none to praise,
And very few could see.
A violet 'neath a mossy stone,
Quite hidden from the eye-.
Is far more easy to discern
Than that same Nude to spy.
She lived unseen. Though some few fakes
pretended her to see;
But if she's on the stairs, it makes
No difference to me.

cause they’re tempered to receive an edge and
to hold it when they get it.

har feature, which carefully spreads the skin, so
that the stubble is forced out far enough to give
as close a shave as can be secured by going .over
the face twice with any other razor.

THIN WOMEN !
Would You
Like a Well Developed
and Well Proportioned
FIGURE?
ANY WOMAN without full bust development lacks the one essential
that creates a perfect appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow
cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take from a woman the bloom and fresh-
ness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been your lot in so far
as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct
yonr deficiency. Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and have
been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from no wasting disease, your
bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased to normal....
_ There are to-day hundreds of women who were once thin, flat-bosomed,
hollow-cheeked and generally scraggly in appearance, and suffering the effects of
arurmia and defective digestion, who are now for the first time in their lives
healthy, full-bosomed and pink-cheelced, and enjoying the full vigor of robust
womanhood, as the result of a few weeks under our wonderful
DR. FALRIERF/S FRESH-FOOD.
Flesli-I'ood is totally harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond question, and its use is
no demand upon the subject’s time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a week, and an
increase in bust measurement up to eight or ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers relief
and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who have despaired of ever possessing
a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-treatment that adds weight and permanent
development to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every case accepted.
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF FETTERS LIKE THIS:

Dear Sir -As a nurse, i was very interested in your Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly

bone and I have good cause to be thankful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I feel certaln
now that I am one of the very best advertisements you could possibly have, as I am developed n
every way satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a good while to prove if it was lasting in
its effect, and I am now glad to say that your splendid treatment has done absolutely all you
claimed it would, my weight and measurements being ample.—l am, yours gratefuhy,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fact—and Fancy.
The channel lights went wink, wink, wink,
The sunset blazed away
Past horary hills, as black as ink,
The harbor’s breast was grey.
A steamer, passing through the Heads
Unto the lighted town,
Showed lights all whites and greens aud
reds—
The smoke was dirty brown.
The sea wind blew, a heartless thing
On curling breakers white.
She played with her engagement ring
And said : “This is all right.”
* * * *
And the channel lights played hide and
seek
Like will-o’-the-wisps were they.
As the delicate blush on a maiden’s cheek
The sunset faded away.
Oh, darkly limned, the low hills held
The harbor, lover-wise;
Grey in the mists, it gleamed and swelled
Like the light in a girl’s grey eyes.
Warm glowed the beacons, the steamer
lights,
And the radiance soft from the town.
As beacons far in the world of nights
The glorious stars looked down.
Gems, in a velvet of royal weave,
They quivered—the kind old stars,
To the old lament, where the sea-winds
grieve
For the seas that die on the bars.
And, breath of the night, all passionate,
Love-child of the earth and the skies,
A wind blew in by the harbor-gate
And kissed my girl’s grey eyes.

Retrospect.
In studying remote periods of history, Cause and
Effect are found to be inextricably tangled. One
factor of causation, almost universally neglected, is
alcohol, to the potency of which much may be attri-
buted .... A dim blue haze of alcohol enshrouds the
mighty past.— Schmidt.
The Crusades were merely glorified fox-hunts.
— Smith.
The glory that was grease,
And the grandeur that was foam,
From the patriot’s pot o’ beer
In the good old days at ’Orne!
Recumbent on canopied couch, in a courtly
atmosphere,
Drunk as an owl the King reclined, plethoric
with food and beer.
Raucously spluttering and mouthing, each
respiration a groan,
Suffused with hiccups and semi-articulate
utterance of the following, or similar
formula, bearing on his exalted pur-
suits: “Put down your hand, partner,
I’ll try it alone!”
Illustrious, pot-valiant days ; the bold, dash-
ing days of old, , , ,
When paladins ate without forks, and drank
from pewters of gold.
The primitive, pre-Wowser days, when Life,
with hard knocks and rubs
Was gradually and silently shaping in her
fecund processes, with that antic humor
which occasionally signalises her produc-
tions, the sport who is trying to
Obliterate all the pubs.
The beer-stricken King was the type of his
bottle-scarred compeers
Who constantly sated a thirst attending him
down the years,
The sack they consumed made the sap of
their stout ancestral tree
Until a few spirited habituals set sail on a
coracle for a Channel run and brought
up in far Cathay. Here again is dis-
played the irony of the Abstract. Guests
of a hospitable Chow, the incomplete
mariners
Repleted themselves with tea.
Potation insidious! Tea! Progressive,
subtle and slow,
But when demand really set in the
drummers of long ago,
As keen as their Damascened blades, placed
tea all over the place ;
And from that day to this the metamorphos-
ing of British diet has concurred with
the tinging of the patrician nasal rubric
with fainter dyes, until now it is quite
reassuring
To look on a noble face.
IIo! for the days of yesterday, sweet era of
splash and booze,
When warriors bold, on gory jags, pig-stuck
the scampering Jews;
Ho ! for Hal the Uxurious, off his block most
of the time.
But who set the fashion in that halcyon
period when delirium tremens were not
improper. Historically the alcoholic
genesis of much doughtiness and amor is
treated economically—the Economy of
History. The only antidote is the Per-
spective of the Theory of Causation.
The Drink ! The Cursed Drink ! Great
Maker of History—in seats of the
misrhty
And slums of the slime.
The glory that was grease,
And the grandeur that was foam,
From the patriot’s pot o’ beer
In the good old days at ’Ome!

The Hudson 37
The Masterpiece of 4$ Engineers.
Howard E. Coffin—America’s greatest motor engineer—when he decided to
build the Hudson “37,” knew the limit of any one man’s ability. But he
was determined this model should be the best four-cylinder car brains could
devise. With this aim he gathered a force of forty-eight experts to aid him
in designing and building it.
The result has realised the intention, and undoubtedly the Hudson “37”
is as fine, as handsome and as comfortable a car as you would like to own.
You can recognise the superior merits of the Hudson “37” at once. You
notice the distinction of its symmetrical streamline body instantly; the
ease of the well-upliolstered seats ; the quiet purr of the motor, the instant
and powerful responsiveness of the engine and the delightful, smooth, glid-
ing sensation of comfort and safety as you ride along any road.

Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the leditor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

ONE OF THE POST PORTS.
A couple of months ago the Sydney Tele-
graph was moved by a correspondent to
republish the tale of the N.S.W. De-
centralisation Committee so far as it
concerned Port Stephens. Also it published
a map showing the advantages of opening up
that neglected deep-water port. The
Telegraph isn’t absolutely crying out for
decentralisation, and it depends mostly for
its support and its advertising business on
the business folk of Sydney, who aren’t
crying out, either. Possibly the paper
reckoned that it could issue a full statement
of the benefits to be gained by opening one
of the closed ports, and thereby assume an
aspect of noble impartiality, and rely on
local prejudice to prevent any harm arising.
No harm has arisen. The policy which re-
gards every deep-sea harbor in the State
save Sydney as a marine leper, and even the
river mouth of Newcastle as a modified
leper, is going as strong as ever.
* * * *
According to the Decentralisation Com-
mission it would be possible to build, in the
northern part of N.S.W., 396 \ miles of
railway at a cost of £2,864,000, which isn’t
much in the case of a Government that
joyfully spends £8,500,000 of loan money in
a year, and weeps because the amount isn’t
more, just as Alexander wept because he
couldn’t find another world to borrow. This
expenditure of £2,864,000 would give about
one-third of the Ma State a much shorter
and cheaper road to a deep-water port than
it possesses at present, and would also give
that area the choice of two ports in place of
one. It would save all the north-east any-
thing from 100 to 300 miles of haulage on
its exports and imports, and save it the
delay which arises from having its goods
held up indefinitely amid the hopeless crush
at Darling Harbor. The railway expendi-
ture ought to pay; lines that cut off hun-
dreds of miles of distance generally do. The
new connections would probably turn sev-
eral of the present bankrupt lines into pay-
able propositions, simply because they would
shift insolvent towns like Bourke and Bre-
warrina so much nearer to a good sea out-
let. They could be built for a song, because
land is cheap by reason of its artificially-
created remoteness from any good place of
export. And it is estimated by the Decen-
tralisation Commission that Port Stephens,
with its natural advantages, could be turned
into a first-class port by an expenditure of
£330,000. Probably, considering the low
values of land round the neglected inlet,
even a Government that was considerably
swindled could acquire for £1,000,000 more
than enough soil on which to build a city
larger than Sydney-—a city of which it
cculd be sole ground landlord till Judg-
ment Day, or till the foreign conquest upset
its plans and made everything of no account.
That would make the total bill some-
thing short of £4,200,000. It shouldn’t seem
exorbitant to a Government which spends
more than twice that amount of loan money
in a single year, and bellows for more.
Considering the probable advantages, it
shouldn’t seem much to any sane and enter-
prising Government. In the first place the
community would gain miles of new
railroad, located in a fertile region, and all
designed to shorten distances and save
money to the producer. If that kind of rail-
road won’t pay handsomely it is time to
either reconsider the method of manage-
ment, or go back to the bullock-dray, or
give up Australia as a bad job. Secondly,
the community would save a huge sec-
tion of the State, including Cobar, Bourke,
Brewarrina, Coonamble, Dubbo, Collar-
enebri, Moree, Tenterfield, Armidale, Tam-
worth, most of the North Coast district —
in fact, everything from the Queensland
border down to Gulgong and Singleton and
Narromine—r-from 100 to 300 miles of rail-
way freight on exports and imports. The
proposed outlay would cover the building of
eight new short-cut lines which would bring
many districts, at present Isolated, into
touch with a coastal city. Presumably that
change would add greatly to the number of
taxpayers and defenders. If it didn’t, all
the ordinary calculations are out of gear,
and political economy has missed the ’bus.
On top of all, there would grow up a com-
mercial centre greater than Sydney because
it would be the legitimate outlet for a greater
extent of country, and all the ground rents
of that city would go into the State
Treasury. The bare land on which Sydney
and its suburbs are located is supposed to
be worth about £50,000,000, and if the land
was State property, and was leased out to
Private Enterprise builders at a very
humble 3 per cent., the annual income would
be £1,500,000. Even half or a quarter of
that amount, added to the profits of the
new short-cut railways, and the saving on
the working cost of the old insolvent rail-
ways through the reduction of distance, and
the money to he made out of the new tax-
payers who would swarm into the country
when they were provided with a new port
from 100 to 300 miles nearer than the old
port, would pay a splendid dividend on the
estimated outlay of £4,200,000. The North
Sydney Bridge would by comparison be a
mosquito alongside an elephant.
.** * *
Any party which took up this question in
real earnest would either do big things or
break big things. It would get out of the
rut, and nowadays the rut is worn so deep
that it is dirticult to see the top hat of Tory-
ism or the bowler of Labor above the sides
of the furrow of routine. It would break
away from the petty questions of Bill’s
“dirt money,” and the obscure riot as to
whether somebody in the Great Wheel
Bang coal mine had been mulcted for an
unduly large proportion of slack, or some-
thing of the sort. It would become a State-
builder on a large scale, and would start
to make money for the people out ,of noth-
ing, and do it in a wholesale fashion. It
would be the pioneer of the doctrine of
Public Ownership of Cities. If the Premier
who created the new inspiration lost his
billet over it because the community wasn’t
yet sufficiently educated, he would at least
have the satisfaction of knowing that he
had attempted something much greater than
Daceyville, and that he had perished politi-
cally as the preacher of no mean gospel.
He wouldn’t go down over a vote of censure
carried because his most unreliable sup-
porter was away at a funeral and no pair
had been provided for him. Nor would he
be sacked for sending a quarrojome mem-
ber of the party to the United States to
report on a 400-gallon tank at £4 per day.
Before he fell he would have been written
up all over the world as the founder, or
attempted founder, of a new order of things.
It isn’t even beyond the bounds of possi-
bility that when he was known to be dis-
engaged he would receive a cablegram in-
viting him to accept an unsteady and ex-
plosive position as President of Mexico.
The report of the Decentralisation Com-
mission in the matter of Port Stephens
opened up great possibilities to any Parlia-
mentarian who wasn’t incurably wedded to
the ancient pottering methods. Unfortu-
nately N.S.W. didn’t possess, at the moment,
that species of Parliamentarian. It only
possessed Holman and Wade and Fitz-
patrick and Meehan and some other
people.
THE EMPLOYMENT OF PRISON
LABOR.
“Lex’s” view of an interesting experiment:
A striking instance of what has been termed by
one of the world’s great phrase-makers (I disremem-
ber for the moment which particular phrase-maker it
was) “the audacity of the elected person, is sup-
plied by the Holman Government’s scheme of affores-
tation by means of prison labor. The idea is under-
stood to have emanated from Minister-for-Justice
Hall —who, by the way, was not then, strictly speak-
ing, an elected person. However, the quality of his
nerve and the pi'ofundity of his ignorance, in certain
respects, are as remarkable as though he was. Lurk-
ing modestly in the remote background of the propo-
sition is the wish, probably, to give the N.S.W.
prisoner as good a time as possible. Tree-planting,
as a substitute for other forms of prison labor,
should do this. And to that extent the sentimental-
ist will possibly approve of the change. But there
is no more to be said in favor of it; and there isi
enough to be said against it to fill a three-volume
novel. #
The existing prison system of N. S. Wales, the
system which the Justice Department threatens now
to undermine, is admittedly one of the best, if not
the best, in the world. It has stood the test of a
15 years’ trial. And the very essence of it, during
all that time, has been the principle of separate
treatment of prisoners ; meaning that prisoners shall
not be allowed to gather together in gangs or classes.
Not only are prisoners debarred as much as possible
from any sort of close association, but they are care-
fully graded so that the amateurs and the unfortu-
nates and those who have fallen into error owing to
some sudden impulse, shall go to one prison (Goul-
burn) and the hardened professionals to another —
Parramatta, as a rule. Thus are evil communica-
tions prevented to a great extent from corrupting
good resolutions. Fully 20 trades are taught in the
gaols. As many of them are sedentary, in the nature
of things, the health of the inmates is preserved by
means of military drill. Very few people are
criminals as a matter of choice. Some rob, steal or
burgle because, owing to their upbringing or social
environment, they have never had a chance to earn
an honest living wage in a, to them, endurable
manner. Others swindle or forge because their health
has been so poor as to debar them from competing
on fair terms with normal folks. All these people
are benefited immensely—and, incidentally, Society
is benefited —by the present prison arrangement. They
learn useful trades; the regular hours and exercise
and the absence of beer set them up in health ; and
they go into the world able to earn money for them-
selves and their dependents if they feel inclined that
way. The most satisfactory proof that many of them
do feel that way is to be found in the facts (1) that
the gaol population has been falling off steadily of
recent years, and (2) that it is a rare thing for a
man who has “done time” under the present system
to return to prison-—that is, unless he is either a
drunkard or a recognised incorrigible. Not that he
has such a fearsome time there. It is simply (1)
that he finds he can get payable and more or less
congenial work outside, and (2) that he has met no
one, while in gaol, who has dinned into him the gos-
pel of the romance and glory of a life of crime—a
common and pernicious habit of the older convicts
in the days before the separate system was introduced.
The tree-planting method of keeping prisoners busy
has been in existence in Maoriland for upwards of
15 years. Till the Holman Government was afflicted
with the idea of introducing it to Australia, no other
country had seriously considered it. It has been
a failure, economically and otherwise, in M.L. Cap-
tain Neitenstein reported against its introduction
to N. S. Wales in 1-900, and the prison authorities
in M.L. have themselves expressed dissatisfaction with
it a score of times. It is safe to say that it is only
persisted in there because, being an imported
institution like imported Governors, hired de-
fence and so on, it is reckoned dangerous for anv
political party to meddle with it. Some of its
defects are palpable to the most astigmatic of ob-
servers. The gathering together for months and
years at a time of a number of unmarried men, or
men whose wives are necessarily separated from them,
is a sizeable enough menace to morality in itself,
Proper supervision is impossible in the circumstances.
The tree-planting is liable to be done carelessly or
badly, or both. More especially is it liable to be
done badly, since it is no game for the inexperi-
enced, being really a branch of agriculture. This is
a pity, for careful and scientific afforestation is a
growing need in M.L., as it is in most civilised coun-
tries to-day. When the convict has finished* his term
he faces the world, under the tree-planting system,
without a means of earning a living; for the world
has not yet reached the stage where a man may
remain solvent by wandering round and planting
trees for gain.
To sum up, afforestation by means of prison labor
is the most expensive possible way of getti ig trees
badly planted. It is subversive to prison discipline.
It involves the association on familiar terms of the
mere bee-inner in crime with the hopeless type who
has practically decided to make Society his prey
and gaol his only real home. It sends the prisoners
out . into the world as helpless as when they were sen-
tenced, with the additional handicap of the prison
taint on them. And all that can be said in extenu-
ation is that convicts have a freer, cheerier life while
tree-planting, as a penalty for their wrong-doings,
than they would have if they were obliged to sit
indoors and learn bootmaking or bookbinding.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Fresh Recruit for the Pigeon-hole.
The Greater Sydney Commissioners handed
in the usual old report the other day. Of
course they favored the immediate institu-
tion of a Greater Sydney, and of course their
effort was pushed through the window, or
flung down the coal hole, with the utmost
possible velocity. Under the Party Govern-
ment system the procedure is unvarying in
regard to all such proposals as the construc-
tion of the North Shore bridge ; the legalisa-
tion of the totalisator; the opening-up of
the starved ports of N.S.W.; and, of course,
the institution of a Greater Sydney. With
the object of placating those who are in
favor of this municipal reform a Commis-
sion is appointed, at great expense, and
directed to get busy. The Commissioners
perfectly well know that their legs are being
pulled; but the pay being on a generous
scale they decide that it is worth while to
act as though there was a possibility of
their efforts bearing legislative fruit. They
examine, accordingly, clouds of witnesses;
take down fathoms of evidence ; travel about
with the zip and the dash of professional
bagmen ; and ultimately, with their tongues
in their cheeks, indite and hand in their re-
commendations. The people who are in
favor of the change are pleased. They go
on for a few months believing that reform
is imminent; and at the end of that time,
if they show signs v of getting restive or if a
general election is mear, it is always pos-
sible to appoint another commission. The
ones who are opposed to change are also
pleased. They know what commissions are.
Of course if the Government waded in to act
on the Commission’s counsels But that,
of course, is unthinkable. No Government
ever pays the remotest attention to the re-
commendations of a Royal Commission un-
less the carrying out of the recommen-
dations is likely to attract votes —in which
case the Government would do the deed,
with instant courage, regardless of the ad-
vice of anyone. It is the misfortune of the
Greater Sydney idea that no votes attach to
the fulfilment of it; or to put it more aeon
rately, a tremendous number of votes vmnli
be alienated temporarily from the fi
Administration which introduced it in .
serious spirit. As to the urgency 0 f t\' i
reform there can be no question r r|
divided authority inseparable from admin if
tration by dozens of small mimicipalitier
coupled with the incompetent handling that
goes with government by the sort of futile
little men whom the small inunicipalitip
elect to represent ttfom, has maf ]p
Sydney a laughing-stock to civilised
visitors. The unspeakable villainy 0 f it
road-surfaces, not merely in the suburbs but
in the heart of the city; the pervasiveness
of its dust; the casual handling of its f ern ,
services : the criminal fashion in which the
different authorities are suffered to steal
large chunks of its public parks—all these
are scandals. On the other hand, all the
suburban mayors and aldermen and their
wives and families and dependents and em-
ployees and friends and bottle-holders and
mere acquaintances would regard it as an
outrage if they were separated from their
jobs. The votes of all these people, and of
all those whom they were able to influence
would go solidly against the Government
which was responsible for the innovation
The conservative element, the section which
opposes all change on principle, would fol-
low their lead. And many a country voter
acting on the general principle that anything
done on behalf of Sydney must be to the
detriment of the country, would be ranged
behind the rest. If needed reforms could
only be brought before Parliament bv
elected Ministers who were indenendent of
any sort of block vote, there would be some
point about the creation of Commissions and
the presentation of their windy reports. As
it is, the whole business is so much mum-
mery, and extremely costly mummery at
that.
The Disillusioning' of Maoriland.
The entire cat is out of Maoriland’s naval-
policy bag, and a remarkable animal it is—
what there is of it. As The Bulletin sus-
pected a month ago, Minister for Defence
James Allen has been well doused with
cold water by that naval prodigy. Winston
Churchill, and practically told that the
two or three dots of rock and mud in the
South Seas don’t matter in the scheme of
Imperial defence, anyhow. Naturally,
James Allen, who, whatever his short-
comings, has given earnest of a patriotic
attention to the naval defence question, par-
ticularly in its bearing on the danger to
the White Man in the Pacific, feels very
bad about it, and says so plainly. lie was
a strong supporter of the agreement made
by the Imperial authorities in 1909, and,
again, in 1911, whereby Australia was to
build its own unit; a unit was to be fur-
nished by the British Navy for the China
Seas, with the New Zealand as flagship;
and another was to be stationed in East
Indian waters. Of course, that arrange-
ment, like many another with the blawsted
colonies, was promptly let slide by J. Bull,
who gathered his fleet round his own vitals.
Australia, knowing Bull of old, and know-
ing also what its own needs are likely to
be, went steadily on preparing for its own
defence at the point where the trouble is
likely to break out, irrespective of John’s
promises to pulverise any enemies of his
offspring if they sailed across the world
into the English Channel and mentioned the
matter there. Maoriland, however, always
overheated by the Imperial fever, placed
implicit trust in the old man. and has con-
sequently been left high and dry on the
oeach, watching the smoke from its battle-
ship’s funnels hanging low over the water-
trail that leads to the Mediterranean.
Allen, when he reached London a few
months ago, wanted to know the whaffor of
this double-dealing, and was highly dis-
pleased with the replies he received. So he
arose in his place in the House of Reps, the
other night and let off steam. He said
it was apparent to him that the Admiralty
had no intention of carrying out the 190.)
agreement. Maoriland wasn’t even to get
the submarines which had been part
of the compact, Winston Churchill or
somebody having discovered that they are
unsuitable for Maoriland waters. Appar-
ently the waters have changed in some mys-
terious manner in the last year or so. The
whole discreditable business Allen sums up
this way :
The Admiralty proposed that Maoriland should rely
upon the Imperial squadron based on Gibraltar. His
own oninion was that it was all, very well t 0 c °P e
with circumstances that might arise in the North Sea
or the Mediterranean, but it was a long way from
Gibraltar to the South Pacific. He was not satishei,
and he knew that Australians were not satisfied,
with the squadron based on Gibraltar. .. .Maoriland
had to look on and see agreements made and broken.
....His own idea, and that of the Government, was
that Maoriland should he considered as an entity, out
it was advisable that Maoriland should work in wit
Australia as far, as possible.
So the disillusionised Quaking Isles begin
sadly to train a few of their own men on a
small ironclad lent by the Admiralty,
Australia congratulates itself on the tact
that, led by Fisher, it declined to waste
any more time over the Imperial navy
dream, and got to work like a man to bun
a solid dqfence of its own.

lled-flaggers of Labor butted in like a bull
at a gate, there was something very sub-
stantial waiting for them. As the row pro-
gressed it became apparent that while arbi-
tration was the catcli-gag of the employers,
the scattering of the Federation of Labor
was the determined policy. Offers of the
Federation to resume work on the old terms
and submit the dispute to a Supreme Court
Judge as arbitrator were therefore declined
without thanks; and after that it hardly
needed the skill of W. M. Hughes, M.H.R.,
in his first cabled message on behalf of the
now-involved waterside workers and seamen
in Australia, to prove that the Maori-
land Employers’ Federation is on strike
against arbitration, and is out to settle
this dispute with a club —and hang the
consequences! And the consequences may
be extremely unpleasant to , all concerned,
particularly to the unfortunate public, which
has to suffer without having a say in the
matter. This is the arrogant manner in
which Hughes’s earnest and reasonable
appeal for placing the dispute before Jus-
tice Joshua Williams (recently appointed
to the judicial committee of the Privy Coun-
cil) was met: —
The Employers, Farmers and Citizens’ Defence com-
mittee has decided to eliminate the United Federa-
tion of Labor, its officers and representatives from
any future negotiations with the unions and workers
for the following reasons [here follow charges of
frequent broken agreements and protests against
I.W.W. methods and objects—all right enough, but
a poor substitute for a convincing reply to the appeal
for peace].
Finally, this to Hughes :
The defence committee acknowledges the receipt of
vour cablegram. In its incomplete knowledge of the
trouble on your side, it cannot presume to offer
advice, and regrets that from your misconception of
the conditions here, and from your credence of mis-
representations, this committee is unable to consider
anything in the direction of the advice which you
have tendered.
Nothing can excuse this attitude ; not even
the bad reputation which the M.L. Federa-
tion of Labor, or a section of it, has in re-
gard to the honoring of agreements. There
was no good reason to flick a finger in the
face of Hughes and the powerful waterside
and marine unions of Australia, unless the
latter refused a guarantee that the award
of Justice Williams would be faithfully
followed. The public has a right to expect
more consideration, particularly from the
Union Steamship Co., around which the
disturbance whirls and gathers pace. The
public certainly pays enough to justify the
expectation. As the position stands, the
Labor conference which is controlling the
Australian end of the chaos has declared
that it will not stand by and see the water-
side workers of Maoriland (no matter how
misgujdedly they may have been led) crushed
under the heel of Capital. Nor was it to
be expected. What that determination will
result in is bound by nothing that can be
seen at present. A general strike in Aus-
tralia is not by any means impossible; —all
because a clique of hypocritical Maoriland
employers have refused conciliation and gone
on strike against arbitration.
“Why Girls Leave Home.”
The views of “10-2-4” :
The disappearance of one or tvvo Sydney girls has
thrown a section of the community into a condition
of panic on the subject of the White Slave trade.
“8.L.” (B. 4/12/’l3) voiced practically the whole
of the nonsense that is being talked by our fireside
bellow-dramatists at the time of writing. There is
the good old yarn about the hypodermic syringe,
the equally ancient incredibility of the strange
woman and the shop and the innocent girl and the
allegedly fainting mother ; and the palpable mendacity
concerning the credulous policeman and the pro
testing virgin and the bogus asylum attendants.
They are all to be found m an disurd romance that
was published by Australia’s old friend,W. N. Willis,
in London the other day. The only standard imbe
cility—if one may use the term—that B-L omits
is the one about the Drugged Bouquet. 0^ th e other
hand, he provides a personal experience—:i hoirnhc
account of how he once noticed a man with the
marks of the brute in his face lurking—there ts no
other word—at the exit of a Central Railway bta

Any experienced detective, and most doctors who
are in the way of knowing about such things, will
readily supply the real reasons why girls leave home
in about 95 per cent, of cases. They are the victims
not of man’s villainy but of man’s laws. Many of
them go to get rid of what Society knows as Chil-
dren of Shame. When the deed is over they come
back, and (provided a newspaper scare has not
raged around their disappearance) resume their old
lives. Often they never come back, but are buried
furtively under an alias and the authority of a
lying death certificate. Others, like one of the young
women who was discovered last week, go off with
their lovers upon the latter achieving some
small financial windfall. These people would
marry, without a doubt, if our social laws allowed
them to. As it is, if the young man happens to be
in a bank, say, the venture is impossible. It is also
impossible in a number of other businesses. So in
the frequent cases where the youth chances to be no
Joseph, and the girl is a shade below the Sarah
class, there is liable to be a “mysterious disannear-
ance,” and sharp pulpit yelps about the White
Slave infamy.
One of the prophylactics against the mere rumor
of White Slavery in Australia is precisely what has
been recommended in England as a cure for the abuse
itself, namely better wages. It is a distressing fact
that most of Europe’s White Slaves have not been
garnered in by such devices as pumping morphia
into them in the public streets, or handing them
chloroformed flowers to smell ; they are eager volun-
teers. Not that they yearn to be slaves ; it is simply
that they are sick of being stone, motherless broke.
The institution of a State Foundling Home, where
illegitimate children might be left and no questions
asked, would obviate a lot more mysterious disap-
pearances. And so would the prosecution of a few
of the abortionists who are known by the police to
be operating in and around Sydney. However, as
none of these reforms is likely to come yet awhile,
the usual old balderdash about girls being grabbed
by White Slavers and removed to places unspecified
for the gratification of plutocrats unknown, will con-
tinue to be blithered wherever the beer flows with a
little more freedom than usual.
Some Ideals which Liberalism Appears
to Have Forgotten.
Senator Gardiner, of N. S. Wales, called
last week upon the Liberals in the Austra-
lian Parliament to get to work. Ilis
point was that talk about the infamies
of Labor was all very well, but that
a straight-out effort to undo some of
the alleged harm wrought by Fisher and
his myrmidons would be more convincing.
He mentioned a few fitting issues on which
to hang the gage of future battle, such as
the repeal of the land tax, the long-
promised compulsory insurance scheme in
lieu of old-age pensions, and the abolition
of the baby bonus. These reforms would be
excellent to begin with. Every true Liberal
knows —or, at any rate, used to know a few
brief years ago —that the Federal Land Tax
is a Socialistic device to confiscate the pro-
perties of inoffensive pastoralists ; that it is
indefensible on every ground, social, polit-
ical and national; that economically it
amounts to a calamity; and that it penalises
the British investor in an outrageously un-
just fashion, and has brought the Common-
wealth into bad odor in London and else-
where. As Liberalism has said, not once
but hundreds of times, the tax has no shadow
of a right to live. The old-age pension sys-
tem is, of course, Socialism of a very flag-
rant sort, and as such is at variance with
the tenets of Liberalism. True Liberals
are, therefore, consistent in advocating that
old-age pensions should be brought under
the Cook party’s proposed insurance scheme.
The scheme cannot, however, be effectu-
ated so long as the Trade and Commerce
clause in the Constitution remains un-
amended. Thus if old-age pensions
could but be abolished, and the insurance
scheme subsequently declared invalid by
the High Court, two of the Tiger’s whelps
would be killed, or at the worst stunned,
with the one stone, as it were —which would
be splendid. Everyone knows all about the
folly and wickedness of the baby bonus —
how it saps the self-respect of the poor and
is squandered by the cynical rich in the pur-
chase of bangles, tiaras, _ etc. Liberalism
cannot consistently leave it on the Statute
Book for an unnecessary moment. _ But
these represent the mere faint beginnings of
Liberal reform. Liberalism is strong on
loyalty ; in fact, it has almost got a corner
in' the article. It is seething with annoy-
ance at the eviction of the Governor-General
from Sydney. The whole row, so far as
N. S. Wales is concerned, is over a trifle of
£2OOO per annum. Let the Cook party
meet the demands of N. S. Wales in i gen-
erous spirit- It is true that, under that
section of the Constitution which forbids
discrimination between the States, the Cook
Administration may have to find equally
ornate residences for Lord Denman in
Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Brisbane. But
what is mere lucre where the King’s honor
and Australia’s reputation for loyalty are
at stake 9 And then there is the Common-
wealth Bank. It absolutely shrieks for ex-
tirpation at the hands of the first honest
Liberal Administration that takes the reins
of office. As the leaders of the party and
the whole of the Liberal press pointed out
when it was first instituted, the chief aim
of this mad Socialistic experiment is to
prejudice the private-enterprise _ banks.
“Fisher’s flimsies,” to use an epigram of
veSter-year or less, are likewise foredoomed
to go lip in the smoke of national insolvency.
Liberalism should not endure them for a
moment. To be strictly consistent, it should
also decline to tolerate the Australian navy
and conscription. The former was de-
nounced by the party three brief years ago
as a tactical absurdity and a manifestation
of hostility to the Empire; while the latter
was termed “un-English” and opposed to
the first principles of British freedom. It
will be time, however, when Liberalisrn has
20t reallv well fixed in the saddle for Cook
and his colleagues to hand the present Aus-
tralian Navy over to the British Admiralty,
in order that the Commonwealth may be
defended in the North Sea, and arrange for
the abolition of conscription and a return
to the volunteer system. Enough for the
present if the Cook party starts out reso-
utelv to repeal the land tax. dissolve the
Commonwealth Bank, abolish the babv
bonus, merge the old-age pension scheme in
the compulsory insurance proposition, and
house the Governor-General in Sydney re-
gardless of any sordid question of finance.
Bv going boldly to the country on these
wood old cries, and agreeing to stand or
fall bv the reception that is accorded them,
the Cook party will gain the name of men
who believe honestly in the principles which
they voice
The Cocky and his Hired Hand, and a
Matter of Quality.
While it doesn’t seem likely that the strike
amongst rural toilers in the Southern States
and N. S. Wales in particular will seriously
disturb the wheat harvest, the main reason
appears to be that the farmers, despite
elaborate bluff in the daily press, are giving
the men what they ask for. Seeing the
trouble that a strike at harvest time means,
this concession was to be expected, provided
the demands are anything in reason.
Whether they are or not must be settled
finally by the Arbitration Court, and the
sooner that is done the better for all parties.
At present the most conspicuous feature of
the business is the suicidal attempt of a
section of the farmers to endeavor to stop
the workings oj: the modern industrial
machine. In refusing in any way to help
bring matters before the Arbitration Court
—in opposing a voluntary conference and
endeavoring to block a compulsory one—
the Farmers and Settlers’ Association is
simply deferring the inevitable. What it
hopes to gain is a mystery. Furthermore,
it is doubtful if its attitude reflects the feel-
ing of even its own members. The impos-
sible thing altogether is to understand what
any farmer reckons to gain by continuing
to keep his industry the least attractive to
the worker. This problem of farm labor is
world-wide, anff the remedy can only lie in
making the calling more attractive. The
Tory attitude of deliberately refusing the
same opportunities to rural workers to
peacefully improve their position as other
workers mostly enjoy simply operates to
reduce the quality of rural labor, which the
Tory now complains is too low-grade. 1 ar-
mers say they do not mind paying good men.
and yet take the attitude that tends more
and more to keep good workers away from
the farm. Any able-bodied, average _ smart
manual worker can do better by hugging the
city than humping Matilda through the un-
limited landscape inland, looking for brief
and low-paid work with appalling feeding
and housing conditions thrown in. Any far-
mer knows the cheapest toiler is the man
who does his work well, whether it is plough-
ing, driving a stripper, stacking, milking or
what not; yet the representative farming
bodies persist in an attitude that drives those
men out of the game, and leaves the most
expensive wasters in it —or, anyhow, must
tend that way, with wage boards and arbi-
tration courts giving workers in other call-
ings good wages and conditions. The shriek-
ing irony of it all is that the cocky does this
because'lie hankers after cheap labor! The
way out lies in paying good wages and pro-
viding better conditions, thus putting the
rural industries on an equal footing with
other industries ; and when the cry is raised
that wheatgrowing, dairying and so on can-
not afford this, it simply gives the lie to the
champions of the farmer who continually
recount the immense returns received from
“primary production.”

The Nationalisation of Public Health.
The suggested nationalisation of medicine
in Australia will not be welcomed by the
great majority of the profession, if one can
judge by the opinions expressed on the sub-
ject at meetings of the B.M.A. and in the
medical press. When the Australian Labor
party declared the socialisation of health
and of the medical profession to be worthy
of a place in its platform, the doctors weren t
much troubled. They reckoned that, like so
many others, the plank would in the course
of a few years rot and drop out. But when
conservative Joe Cook declared for a
National Insurance scheme (now being
drafted by McMahon Glynn), the Medical
Association rubbed the film from its eyes,
and decided that “drastic legislation was
certainly possible. The recently-reported
conversion of a Collins-street doctor shows
that the yeast is working. Nevertheless the
prejudice of the profession to what seems a
rational and equitable reform is very. strong
—so strong and general in democratic Aus-
tralia as to be almost unintelligible. Even
in allegedly-conservative England (where
a defiant 8.M.A., unfortunately for the pres-
tige of a powerful and necessary organisa-
tion. was successfully flouted by Lloyd
George) a State Medical Service Associa-
tion was inaugurated 18 months ago
at Liverpool, having for its object the advo-
caev of a national medical service “to. be
organised on the lines of other State services
now in existence.” Then, in January ot
this year. Prof. Benjamin Moobe read a
paper before the London Medico-Legal
Society advocating the entire socialisation
of the profession. Ilis scheme included the
constitution of a State Department of Medi-
cine “with a responsible, well-informed and
well-trained Minister in Parliament to re-
present it,” just ns the Lord Chcincellor is
an efficient and representative head of the
Law. He considered an average fair basis
of pavment to be £5OO a year, with retire-
ment on pension at 05 years of age. Ihe
difficulty of bringing the private doctors into
the State service was to be overcome by
granting them a salary on the basis of a
three-years’ average, with an allowance tor
changed conditions. The whole medical ser-
vice was to be graded on civil-service lines.
No sensible financial criticism has been
levelled at these proposals. Many of the
obiections, when not outrageously selfish- are
ludicrous. Thus Prof. Lindsay of Belfast,
in an address before the Ulster Medical
Society in April last, stated that it was an
“improbable assumption” that all classes in
any single area would consent to be served
by the same doctor. “Her Ladyship
without undue snobbishness, hesitate to dis-
cuss her ailments with the doctor who was
in attendance upon her cook or her toot-
man.” This was put forth as a sensible ob-
jection to a great democratic proposal.
Doubtless her Ladyship will also demand a
snecial fire and a reserved pitchfork in
Hades.
The Scourge of the Innocent.
Down south last week an unhappy boy of
13 died, and for one reason and another the
Coroner committed his parents for trial on
a charge of manslaughter. In the cant jour-
nalistic phrase of the day lie was “suffering
from a certain disease.’ It is possible,
without seeing the death certificate, to
guess pretty confidently that the disease was
syphilis. On the same day the Director of
Quarantine announced the arrangements ot
the authorities in regard to the Malwa,
aboard which vessel there was a death from
small-pox between Colombo and Fremantle.
The whole of the passengers are to be left
at Portsea (Vic.). The ship will pro-
ceed to Sydney with no passengers, and
none but the effectively-vaccinated members
of the crew. In Sydney it will be
fumigated from stem to stern and left in
quarantine till December 20. By those
means the Commonwealth will be protected
absolutely from the possibility of small-pox
infection, so far as the Malwa is concerned.
As regards the child above-mentioned, had
death not come as a providential relief, the
community would have gone in constant peril
of him. A Commission inquired exhaustively
into the question of venereal disease in
Victoria last year. It found that syphilis
was hideously prevalent, and it made a num-
ber of drastic recommendations. The
Weary-Watt Government considered them,
pigeon-holed them, and went on doing noth-
ing as heretofore. Had it been half as
active as the Federal authorities were in re-
gard to the Malwa small-pox case, an ines-
timable amount of good would have resulted.
For one thing, the wretched lad who is now
dead would have been saved unthinkable
misery and suffering; for another, he would
have had 12 months less in which to im-
pregnate others with his dreadful complaint.
There is a comfortable delusion prevalent
among the righteous that syphilis is the
especial perquisite of sinners. Nothing could
be further from the truth. Paradoxical
though it may seem, the real, true-blue,
dyed-in-the-wool immoralist is rarely afflicted
with anything of the sort. He knows too
much, for the most part. The chief sufferers
are those who “fall” on the impulse of the
moment; those who are infected, in • all
innocence, as a result of using towels or
brushes or shaving implements or cups or
glasses that have been polluted by diseased
persons; and, above all, children. Syphilis
is essentially a children’s disease. It is one
of the mercifully-few complaints that an
unborn infant may contract. Sometimes the
children of diseased parents are not afflicted
with the actual complaint itself; but they
rarely escape the indirect effects of it, identi-
fiable in shattered nerves, distorted forms
or faces, mental weakness, or some other
ghastly handicap. How long before Aus-
tralia "decides to drop its present attitude of
bourgeois reticence, and recognise that there
is in its midst a thing far worse than small-
pox or diphtheria or even the plague, if only
because these notifiable diseases, while less
disgusting and infinitely less dreadful in
their after-effects, are not, like it.
transmitted to the innocent descendants of
those suffering from them? The moment
the community makes up its mind to accept
the presence of syphilis _ in the same
healthily matter-of-fact spirit as it has
always accepted the presence of (say) small-
pox, "the beginning of the end so far as this
calamity is concerned will have arrived.
Its extirpation will be a comparatively easy
matter once the ground has been cleared by
convincing the doctors that it is as much
their moral duty to notify it as any other
comolaint, and by bringing it home to un-
thinking oietists that the unprotected child
rather than the rake is the worst sufferer
from it.

“Barnacle” ranges alongside: —
If the maritime strike foolishness, continues, there
is going to be trouble over the business of manning
the big steamships which carry passengers between
Australia and Maoriland. The Union Cods liner Man-
ganui on her last trip across the Tasman Sea was
handled by a heterogeneous mixture of landsmen,
some of them in riding pants. men who
wanted to reach Sydney took a hand ; even Kennkkley
Rumford got a cheap advt. by declaiming his willing-
ness to stoke coal. I didn’t hear if Clara Butt volun-
teered as a stewardess, but if she didn’t it’s the fault
of her press agent. The Union Co. also got the
Aorangi away a short while back by announcing that
steerage passengers wouldn’t be carried. The co.
naively explained that if this class were booked the
British Merchant Shipping Act would automatically
operate, and the N.S.W. Marine authorities would
have to furnish a written certificate (1) that the
Aorangi was properly manned, (2) that the ,crew
could manage the life-saving appliances, and (3)
that there were sufficient firemen for the engine-room.
By shutting out steerage passengers the co. practi-
callv admitted that it was dubious whether its scratch
crew could satisfy the authorities. By the quaint
logic of the British Marine Act the certificate referred
to isn’t required when mere saloon passengers are
carried. From a seaman’s point of view, the whole
business of travelling with inefficient crews is bad at
any time. In the event of catastrophe—collision,
fire, wreck or even severe storm —the seamen in patent
leather pumps and firemen in riding breeches may
be all that is required. Much more likely they may
not. The steamship Bega foundered one fine after-
noon on the east coast of Australia in a sea as smooth
as a duck pond. Why has never yet been known ;
hut the accident occurred when a maritime strike
was on, and the vessel was manned by ship-captains
and a scratch crew. It is generally believed that
had she been manned by a crew that kne\y her
the wreck would have been prevented. That acci-
dent occurred in sight of land, and' the nondescript
crowd had great difficulty in launching the boats by
which the passengers scrambled ashore. If a ML
liner strikes trouble in bad mid-ocean weatiier th«
iohnnv-all-sorts crew may be able to struggle w’th
the life-saving gear : but I’ll bet the Union S.S. Co.
two drinks I won’t be on the passenger list.

The result of the N. S. Wales general elec-
tion on Saturday shows that there is no
tougher job than to convince a young, virile
and partly-intoxicated State that its worst
enemies are those parliamentarians who are
prepared to give it just what it wants for
the moment. The thing that N. S. Wales
most yearns for, at the present time, is a new
boom; or rather a recrudescence of the old
boom which has lately shown signs of peter-
ing out. Land speculators want it so that
they may push off allotments which they
never had the remotest intention of using
except as gambling instruments. Theatri-
cal managers hunger for it as a means of
tilling their depleted playhouses. Parsons
look to it as something which will result in a
shilling being put into the plate where three-
pence, or a penny, or even the callous illu-
sion of a button was inserted before. To
workers it means better wages for the time
being, and to shopkeepers temporary afflu-
ence, as a result of the community’s artifici-
ally-increased spending power. While the
boom drunk is at its height all hands radiate
happiness and optimism. Life is one vast
carnival. It is this spirit which the Hop-
man Government catered for when it
announced last month, in triumphant tones,
that it was proud of having been the State’s
record pawnshop frequenter, and wanted to
be returned to office chiefly that it might
besiege the old haunts with added vigor, and
borrow so magnificently that advocates of
honest and sane finance would blink with
astonishment. This shocking boast, and the
still more shocking programme for the
future, proved such good electioneering tac-
tics that, although Labor has had three years
wherein to disappoint its supporters, and
though it has disappointed them grievously
by its contempt for its own platform, yet it
is apparently going to poll a bigger block
vote throughout the State than the party
which, whatever its demerits, was at least
pledged to sane finance. Still, however well
this may serve the immediate purposes of the
Labor party, it is tragically bad business for
the State. The public endorsement of rotten
finance is a cumulative calamity under a
rotten system of government. No party
attempts to be any more upright than the
general body of the electors, for the simple
reason that to do so is equivalent to asking
for political extinction. The encouragement
which the Holman party has received at
the polls—irrespective altogether of whether
or no it gets a majority in the Assembly—is
likely to have the pernicious effect of imbuing
its opponents with the notion that their best
hope lies also in a lavish expenditure of
public funds. With the two big parties com-
peting as to which shall borrow and “blew”
hardest, the financial lot of the local infant
—who must meet the bill —will be a hard one
indeed.
J. E. Dodd, M.L.C., as a rule the most
level-headed of Westralian Laborites, has
shocked a lot of his admirers by denouncing
the Australian defence system. The trouble
is that Dodd is intensely religious, and war
is irreligious; hence Dodd disapproves vio-
lently of preparations for war. Apparently
Dodd is willing to trust his neighbor. In
that case, one wonders why Dodd has
organised workmen into trades unions. Why
not leave things to their employers? It is
surely no less safe to trust your neighbor in
the next street than your neighbor in (say)
Japan.
Victoria’s new Premier, George A. Elm-
slie, is a stone-cutter by trade, but has re-
presented the Stonemasons’ Union on the
Trades Hall Council for many years. He
started political life in 1891. when he and
Frank Anstey joined a branch of the old
Progressive Political League on the same
night. Eleven years later he was chosen to
wrest the difficult Albert Park seat from J.
S. White, succeeded at the first try, and has
held it ever since. He was acting-leader
during Prendergast’s absence in the Cold
Land, but has been the actual Opposition
leader only nine weeks.
The face of McLeod, the “corner” leader
in the Vic. Assembly, was a study when the
psychological moment came to tumble Watt
and co. over. The Redistribution Bill’s sec-
ond reading had been carried only on the
Sneaker’s vote, and it was obvious that if
Watt went on with it he would be defeated
in committee. That was the tip for office-
seekers. Clauses 1 and 2 were passed.
Clause 4 proposed to raise the number of
members to 70. While M.L.A. Snowball
was questioning whether clause 3 (which
proposed to repeal the existing provision for
65 members) was the right one on which to
take a test vote, Opposition-leader Elmslie
quietly handed the Chairman a notice of his
intention to move an amendment to clause 4.
When Snowball sat down McLeod an-
nounced his intention of moving an amend-
ment to clause 4. The House prattled for
a few minutes over clause 3 and agreed to
postpone it. Instantly McLeod jumped up
to get his blow in—and sat down in surprise
when he found that Elmslie had forestalled
him. In any case Elmslie held the stronger
hand, though neither of them can live with-
jut the other.

At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, the Quinlan
Opera Co. produced “II Trovatore” for the
first time this season on Monday evening.
Verdi’s operas have been threatened with
extinction by apostles of the Wagnerian
creed for the last 20 years; yet a Verdi
opera, even with a mediocre cast, will always
revive the fortunes of a fainting season any-
where outside Germany. So “II Tro-
vatore” kept the J.C.W. Peri at the
gate busily engaged turning away cash
till after eight o’clock; and finally
the onslaught of the public had to
be suppressed with closed doors. The co.
gave one of its best performances—bar minor
accidents due to insufficiency of rehearsals.
Jeanne Brola (Leonora) has rarely been so
well placed : the light, florid music was ad-
mirably suited to the American soprano’s
flexible voice. Maurice d’Oisly, whose
melodious tenor has to struggle through a
beefy temperament, surprised his critics by
the warmth and ardor of his Manrico.
Graham Marr, heavily draped in a red sash
that hung like a halter about his neck, and
top-booted to his thighs, was the bad man
of the opera, Count di Luna. He was so
inarticulate that his villainy was lost in the
recesses of his beard. Edna Thornton was
the Gipsy Azucena. The chorus work was
patchy. On Friday evening “The Prodigal
Son,” followed by a symphony concert, will
be the last first-night flicker; and on Satur-
day the co. farewells in “Lohengrin.”

After being dead as far as Sydney is con-
cerned for some time, “A Girl’s Temptation”
made a feeble effort to breathe again at the
Adelphi on Saturday night, and whether it
succeeded or not is a matter of opinion.
First aid to the apparently downed was
rendered by George Cross, who acted up to
his usual standard as the hero; Miss Vera
Remee, who did admirably as the much-
wronged heroine; and Tom Lloyd, whose
villain was equal to the worst of his other
villains. The resuscitation will continue
for a fortnight. Then “Aladdin.”

The concert to Donald Mcßeath at Syd-
ney Town Hall on Monday niglxt was forti-
fied by John McCormack, who had to intro-
duce “Kathleen Mavourneen” and other
well-known Irish ladies before the encore
fiends were satisfied. John Carlton Fay
at the piano, soprano Max Huxley, Donald
behind the fiddle, and Vera Watt as an extra
voice filled the programme.

Pinero’s remarkable modern tragedy,
"Mid-Channel,” will fee presented for the
first time in Australia by the Sydney Re-
pertory Society at a mating! at the Criterion
next Monday, with a cast entirely profes-
sional. Miss Muriel Starr, the emotional
actress of “Within the Law,” has been given
permission by the Firm to appear; and she
will be supported by Grace Palotta, Gwen
Burroughs, Agnes Keogh and Nancy Mus-
grove ; and Eric Maxon, Reginald Wykham,
Arthur Styan, Winter Hall, and Stuart
Clyde. This will be the one opportunity
afforded a Sydney audience of seeing Miss
Starr away from modern American melo-
drama.
Although Du Calion’s balancing at the
Tivoli would make a turn of its own, his
patter while he perches on a ladder
that leans up against the atmosphere is his
strong point. But in case the house hasn’t
even then had enough for its money, he
squeezes a few tunes from an instrument
that might be a dislant relation of a con-
certina. Taken all round the business is novel
and clever. Willette Whitaker, the Petleys,
Barton and Ashley, Rosa Roma and the
Golden Dancers prevent things getting dull
during the remainder of the proceedings.

It’s a brighter programme than usual this
week at the National Amphitheatre (Syd-
ney). It generally is. ' Headliners are
Mitchell and (comedians), Max
and Cameron (ventriloquists and singers),
and the Franco Midgets (conjurers, illusion-
ists, comedians and- dancers). There are
about a dozen others on the programme who
ought to be headliners. Anybody who
doubts this can go and ask them.

The novelties at the White City (Sydney)
have been turning thousands of feet in that
direction since the pleasure ground was
opened a week ago. It is at a place like
this that a Sydney crowd is seen at its mer-
riest, and the laughter along the route of
the scenic railway, the glad shrieks of the
girls on the underground river, and the
shouts of the kiddies and other joy-riders
on the great “caroussel” gratefully drown
the barks and howls of the adjacent Stadium
push as it sools man on to upper-cut and
“out” his Christian brother.

In-no-cence in the customarv sinful be
havior, with the sister of the would-be vie
tim acting as the protectress of virtue at
critical moments. Sister Patricia is
chorus lidy, and she helps her small relative
Nora, out of the mud of indiscretion by ven-
turing into the apartments of the'giddv
Lothario, where the reckless Nora is lying
concealed, momentarily expecting the Worst
to happen. Pat’s rescue of Nora is car-
ried out with a massive assumption
of bluff and a persistent splutter of Yankee
slang, and the only reward that she earns
for her interference is a vast and compre-
hensive charge of misconduct at various
places and hours unspecified. Eventually
the lady disproves the accusation and re-
stores the confidence of ma, pa and surround-
ing friends and relations. A new actress
Miss Virginia Brissac, gives vent to Pat’s
demonstrations of Amurkan methods and
language ; her eloquence sounds like ragtime
with the vocal inflections in the wrong
places. Miss Geraldine O’Brien is more
natural and unaffected as the ingenue,
A ora, and is the most conspicuous item in
the cast. Ferdinand Munier is the wicked
Dick Crawford, and obliges with a bit of
somnambulism. Howard Nugent is at large
in the part of Patrick O’Brien ; Miss Mar-
garet Nugent is sufficiently assertive as
Mrs. O’Brien; while Harry Burkhardt as

Owing to the imminence of the annual
panto., “The Balkan Princess” will continue
its feeble course for only a few nights more
at Her Majesty’s, Melbourne. Meanwhile
Phil Smith, as the larcenist Blatz. is getting
on with his collection of old silver; and
Bobt. Whyte is depicting his waiter on
whimsically melancholy lines as usual.
Frank Greene maintains interest in his part
by his heroic concentration ; on the other
hand, Reginald Roberts, as Prince Boris, is
as lackadaisical as maybe, and the whole
company is vocally as weak as ever it was.
Incidentally, Miss Dorothy Brunton is em-
bellishing the role of Magda with some of
her native vivacity.

The Butterfly will cease to flutter at
Melbourne Royal to-morrow night, and Col-
lingwood will give up his pursuit of the
foolish insect on the same evening. The
entertainment for Saturday is “Miss Eliza-
beth’s Prisoner,” preceded by a one-act
detective drama, “The Great Game.”
At Melbourne Princess’s “For the Term
of Plis Natural Life” is having another time
on earth, with Vivian Edwards as the Rev.
North, Miss Elwyn Harvey as Sylvia
Vickers, and Cyril Mackay unloading his
emotions as “good Mr. Dawes.” Edwards
plays the beer-biting North with all his soul
in the bite, so to speak ; but Mackay’s and
Miss Harvey’s impersonations are only con-
ventional readings. Herbert Leigh is an old
offender as Captain Maurice Frere; the sus-
tained cannibalism of Charlie Taylor as
Gabbett is recorded with subdued applause;
and Miss Marie D’Alton pursues the line
of most economy in acting the haughty Lady
Devine. As a whole, however, the show is
capably produced by George Willoughby, and
the stage-pictures by J. S. Mann are pleas-
ing achievements.

Practically the same cast that introduced
“The Grafters” to Melbourne’s notice at the
Bijou is raising its collective voice in the
present outburst at the King’s, though the
adipose Dutchman, formerly caricatured by
Frank Vack, is now represented by Paul
Stanhope with precipitate calm. Also Miss
Elaine Ravensberg is a plumper piece of
agitation than the former Mrs. Dolly
Grafter, while a Fritzie de Guy does some
ladylike loitering as the unimportant
Maude. Bert La Blanc and Dave Nowlin
are as noisy as before, or more so, and Miss
Eugenie Le Blanc is still the owner of two
nimble legs*.. “The Grafters” will conclude
about Wednesday next week, and explora-
tions in “The Land of Nod” will begin on
the following Saturday.

H'um on Saturday, suffers from the funda-
mental bias of nearly all Repertory drama.
It deals almost exclusively with exceptional
people. The least unconventional character
in a cast of seven is an intermittent stage
butler who is a mental, if not physical, re-
vival of the humorous waiter in “You Never
Can Tell.” The others include variegated
reversions from the humdrum in the persons
of a waster, a vegetarian Labor M.P. and
an elderly satyr, the lot assisting to create
the atmosphere of pretentious irony in which
the central figure, Hilary Cutts, exposes a
fund of Shawian paradox and makes a show
of philosophic self-sacrifice. Cutts, the
eccentric son of an eccentric father, is a
sort of fatuous idealist who is ready to die
for any altruistic theory so long as it is
expressed in gentlemanly English. In this
case he is asked to perish on behalf of a
crowd of incapable brothers and sisters, who,
according to the will of their lamentable
parent, are only prevented from enjoying the
fruits of his industry by the continued exist-
ence of their elder brother. Whether Hilary
should go on living, and prevent his papa’s
money going to relations who are too hope-
lessly incompetent to keep themselves, is the
fanciful idea of “The New Sin.” Its suc-
cess for dramatic treatment depends upon the
audience’s readiness to believe that in
a family of a dozen or more only one has
sufficient gumption and business push to
avoid the poorhouse. To this critic the
drama seems to be merely a tower of fitful
argument tottering on a fantastic hypothesis.
Apart from this, however, it affords a good
entertainment in its play of wit and epigram.
Also, the author’s youthful irreverence for
accepted conventions is strong enough to
convince the respectable worshipper of Hing-
lish institutions that, if British drama has
not gone to the dogs, it is at least being
worried by impertinent puppies. The acting
was generally tolerable, the company having
evidently, for one thing, conscientiously re-
hearsed the parts.

At the Opera House on Saturday Gene
Greene introduced an Australian Rag,
chiefly remarkable for syncopated allu-
sions to the “old bush track” and other
Australian properties. The Richards

for the first time, are worth favorable men-
tion ; but the alleged “striking act” _of
Doody and Wright looks like something
dug up at an amateur trial night.

Exit from Adelaide Tivoli, manager Mar-
cus, after some 13 years in office, during
which the show lias grown from a small and
intermittent one to an important produc-
tion. He had a good send-off, with presenta-
tions from stage and audience, and speeches
by Mayor Bonython and others. The
weather has been all against indoor shows,
and Branscombe’s Dandies, in the open at
the Exhibition, have been easily the most
popular local thing offering. The Royal has
had a visit from the Williamson directorate,
planning important alterations. “The
Squatter’s Daughter” has finished her season
there. It is not too much to say that Bert
Bailey carries the play on his back, and
whenever he is on the stage there is joy.
But the most envied of the characters on
the hot nights were the two bushrangers who
get upset into the waterfall. Denniston’s
Buckler Co. is just starting. At the
King’s are the Spanish Malagas, splendid
animals both, who have something new to
show in the way of dancing. At this house
“Zif,” and at the Tivoli Eric Stone, put in
some rapid cartoon sketching. Picture
houses show an impressive Roberts funeral,
but the best things in sight are an aviation
sensation at West’s and views of London at
Wondergraph. Concerts are too many to
count, but the ’Varsity students brought an
original tone into theirs with what was prac-
tically a “Revue” on real French lines. The
performers—all men—satirised everything
from the new State Governor to the abat-
toirs, from the Professors to the lean legs of
Dorothea Spinney—the last a fair subject
f o r satire, because the talented little lady
w ho owns them made fun of them herself
when giving her Greek dances. Adelaide
gave her a great time. It saw a chance to
back its reputation for culture, and jumped
a t it.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Ginno Fizzo”: Martin Marcus, who retires from
the management of Adelaide Tivoli this week, is
one of the late Harry Rickards’s oldest battlers. He
drifted into Australia in his younger days, set up
storekeeping in Yorketown (S.A.), and worked off
some of his superfluous energy by becoming mayor of
the hamlet. But drains and kerbs were out of his
line, so he next produced “Pinafore,” with 60 chil-
dren and a few older performers, including himself
as Ralph Rackstraw. This is said to have been the
first juvenile performance of an opera ever given in
South Aus. When he sold the storekeeping business
he went to Adelaide as a merchant, and sang at all
the important concerts of the day. Among those he
warbled with were Ada Crossley, Mrs. Palmer Caran-
dini, Armes Beaumont and A. G. Law. He took the
tenor role in 27 oratorios, and has sung in the
“Messiah” 12 times. He first went on tour as a
manager in Maoriland, taking a concert co., which
included Belle Cole and Charles McGrath (now of
the Quinlan Co.) He followed up this tour with 37
others through Maoriland. Later, he was with
George Itignold, and then opened the Adelaide Tivoli
for Rickards; and for a while, when the Tiv. was
closed, kept an eye on the Melbourne Princess for
J.C.W., when “The Marriage of Kitty” and “The
Duke of Killiecrankie” were produced for the first
time. At one stage in his career he produced, in
the old Albert Hall (Adelaide), now the Salvation
Army Barracks, that thing of Strauss’s which was
recently' modernised as “The Nightbirds.” In fact,
he has done nearly' everything in the amusement line
except run a circus. He is now bustling towards the
seventies, but looks good for many another show yet.
“Haresfoot”: The death of H. H. Vincent is
cabled. There have been two Vincents prominent on
the Melbourne stage. The first was C. Vincent, right
name Vyner, husband of Miss Cleveland. He was in
the first Co-operative Royal management, 1867, with
Lambert, Harwood, Stewart, Vincent, Bellair
and Hennings. H. H. Vincent came from
England, under engagement to Coppin, in
1873, with Whyte, Owen, Reynolds and three
ladies. They opened in “New Men and Old
Acres.” Vincent soon established a good position as
actor and stage manager. His best run of acting
was with Warner at the Princess’s, when he was Sir
Peter in “The School for Scandal,” Damas in “Lady
of Lyons,” Dornton in “Road to Ruin,” and Polonius
in “Hamlet.” Like Harwood or Cathcart, Vincent
could act anything. He made a little fortune, but
when the boom burst it dissipated and he found him-
self in the stranded boat with such economists as
Harwood and Stewart, while Greville came out rich.
Vincent then returned to London for a fresh start,
and got on well again. Revisiting Melbourne, he
appeared with Miss Waldorf, at Her Majesty’s, as
Jaques in “As You Like It,” and Mercutio in “Romeo
and Juliet.” He was just the stamp of man, short of
a star, to make money on the stage—what is called
a manager’s man, apt for any business whatever con-
nected witih a theatre. I daresay he could even
paint a scene.
“Gazer”: Marshall Hall is not returning to Aus-
tralia, whereat genuine regret is rife among music-
lovers. He had a varied career in these parts, pass-
ing through times good, bad and indifferent. The
pity of it was that most of his troubles could have
been averted by a little tact and restraint. He was
appointed to the Ormond Choir in the usual hap-
hazard English selection-committee way. But, though
at the time lacking the necessary qualifications, he
had latent possibilities, which he developed with re-
sults that merit our eternal gratitude. The main
cause of his troubles was his inability to stick to his
job; moreover, he had that “superior” way which
makes even the Philistine worm turn. However, he
is blessed with energy and enthusiasm, and can be
depended on to peg out a good claim for himself
almost anywhere.
“Macko”: My introduction to Marchesi was at a
students’ concert seven years ago. It took place in
the Salle Iloche, Paris, a building now given over to
mild boxing bouts, where the female patron is almost
as numerous as her brother. I got to the matinge
early, and numbers of musical and dramatic critics
were pointed out to me, as well as concert promoters
and an operatic entrepreneur. The place was packed,
and everybody talked noisily in English, German,
Italian or French. Right in the front row of the
stalls was a large fauteuil, and in it dozed
Marchesi —a little old woman in violet velvet, her
thin white hair crowned with a bonnet of pansies and
shaggy glass beads. When the curtain went up, 10
pupils rpade a debut in turn, among them “Benda,”
from Victoria, and Beatrice Oxley, a Sydneyite. Mar-
chesi still slept on ; there was nothing to show that
she was not dead except a slight quiver of the glass
in her headgear. At last one pupil, who had been
singing Handel’s “Rossignol” very well, completely
broke down in her final cadenza. Marchesi was in-
stantly galvanised. In a moment she looked like an
animated witch; flying behind the scenes like a
tornado she blamed, not the weeping soprano, but
the flautist, angrily scolding and threatening him in
voluble French for several minutes. To show that
the girl’s voice had not failed we heard her sing, in
the wings, the last bar of her song over again sans
accompaniment. Then Marchesi, the tired old teacher,
came on with the singer, who bowed her acknow-
ledgments amidst great applause.
E. H. Major, one of the chiefs of the J. C.
Williamson house, has decided to take another holi-
day, though the last one he had was only about 13
years ago. When he isn’t loafing on holiday he puts
in his time as secretary for the Australasian and
S’African business of J.C.W., Ltd. In between
times he is an executor of the J. C. Williamson
estate; also, he is a chartered accountant, which
additional qualification he has used with advantage
to the firm he has been with so long. For relaxation
he is a J.P., but as he is going to India where J.
Pees are not popular, he desires that the information
shall be kept out of print. When he returns from
the land of cheap nigger he will take over the con-
trol of the Firm’s finances.
Tom Pollard, of the one-time familiar Pollard’s
Juvenile Opera Go., still takes a hand at the old
business in Maoriland. At present he is engaged in
arranging the production of “The Geisha” for the
Wellington amateurs.
T. J. West, of the big Australian picture firm,
commenced his career in the ticket office at St.
James’s Hall, Piccadilly, London. He rose rapidly
to be treasurer, and then manager, and was soon
in business for himself. He first took the road with
Banvard’s American Diorama, and at Edinburgh got
his big scream with a panorama scene of a farm
homestead. In the forefront of this was a painted
horse which had a real tail pushed through the
canvas and waggled from the back. West was one
of the first managers in England to exploit the
kinematograph. His show combined a demonstration
of the Rontgen Rays, a series of dissolving views
and a then-new method of stereoscopic projection
for still pictures. For this last-named scheme mem-
bers of the audience were supplied with an imple-
ment similar to a lorgnette, each of which cost
2s. 6d., and thousands were stolen by people who
paid sixpence and one shilling for admission. In
those days of the kinematograph a film 150 ft. long
was looked upon as a great feature ; last week West
unreeled in Sydney an 8000 ft. film. A very few years
ago he was turning his own picture mangle in Maori-
land and glad to see a full house; to-day if you
borrowed £lO,OOO from him and didn’t repay him
he would be less upset than if you served him with
a bad cigar.
“D”: One of the most unpleasant spectacles I
ever paid to see is provided at a White City
(Sydney) side-show. In a sort of bear-pit are some
snake-charmers and about half a ton of snakes.
Crouching in a corner on the night I attended the
show Were two shuddering galah parrots. They were
there presumably to be eaten should one of the
reptiles feel like breaking its fast; and from the
look of them the wretched birds knew it. While I
was observing them with sorrow in my heart the
chief spake-expert uprose in the middle of the pit
and clamored for silence. He announced his in-
tention of proving a thing that no one had dis-
puted, namely that at least one of his possessions
was capable of killing anything it bit. To that end
he produced a violently struggling mouse or small
rat, approached the hideous head and darting
tongue of a black snake, and —but at that stage I
left, in company with a number of others. It seems
to me that the sooner the White City discards this
exhibition the better. There are legitimate ways of
killing those animals which must be killed, but the
White City method is not among them —apart from
the effect it is likely to have on the children who
form such a big section of the shows patrons.
Fred McDonald, the delightful Dave of “On Our
Selection,” was married in Melbourne a few days ago
to an Adelaide girl who has done a little acting with
Afabel Hardinge, a young South Australian actress
who tours the small towns.
Dear Bulletin, —A final word upon “Billy T.’s”
latest contribution to our somewhat futile controversy
anent the relative badness of the bellowdrammer of
to-dav and yesterday. I urged that it was useless
to talk of an improved standard, seeing that (a) the
.best of present-day bellows are not as good as “The
Silver King,” “The Red Lamp” and others, and (b)
the worst of the old bellows were not as bad as “The
Tart Who Knew a Bit” and its kind. William now
admits the force of this argument, but endeavors to
obscure his retreat in a cloud of rhetorical duet.
“ ‘Harrison O.’ and I,” he states, “dunno where we
are in our contentions. I started with a few words
to the effect that living pictures were knocking the
sensational elements out of popular bellowdrama.”
This demonstrates conclusively that “Billy” certainly
dunno where he are; for if he will take the trouble
to look up his first paragraph, to which I took excep-
tion, he will find that living pictures are not men-
tioned, indicated, or even darkly adumbrated therein.
Knowing that he —like myself—is looked to for
guidance and enlightenment by millions of eager
readers, Willy should not be guilty of misrepresen-
tation of this sort. His perfidy moves me to beers.
—Yours, Harrison O.
“Busk” : Arthur Adams is, no doubt, satisfied with
£lOO for his national chirp; but look at
Stephen Adams got for his songs! “Queen of
Heart” raked him in £40,000 in one year; Her
Golden Hair was Hanging Down Her Back’ earner!
£20,000 in a few months; and “Hush, Hush,
It is the Bogie Man,” was nearly as dollarous. Ihe
Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo” and Ine
Rowdy, Dowdy Boys” were not so magnificent; still
they brought in tens of thousands. Even “The Lost
Chord” is a poor thing beside such works of £ en i u *"T
it brought Sullivan very little more than £lO,OOO
altogether. Moral: Don’t write National Anthems.
Write something either for the music-hall or tor
Janie to practise with her young man in the evenings.
If she can also do it on Sunday afternoons after
Sabbath school, so much the better.
“Blue Mask”: The White City (Sydney) proprie-
tors are very sanguine that the new amusement park
will pay handsomely, but I dunno. I remember that
Bill Anderson was even more sanguine when he was
getting 124 per cent, interest on his £20,000
Wonderland, at Bondi. And I can’t forget that Wil-
liam dropped every one of 15,000 sovereigns in the
venture. The second year cooked him. Of course, the
White City has a better chance than Wonderland
had, especially if the management avoids the mis-
take of planking a ticket box at too many side-
shows ; but the pile of money that has been put down
(about £30,000) will take a lot of lifting back. The
main difficulty of the promoters is transit. On the con-
gested King-street tramline White City visitors have
to struggle for the cars with “fight” crowds bound
for or from the Stadium, and a little of that goes a
long way, particularly with women and children.
Saturday is the Stadium’s big night and, of course,
should be the White City’s big night too —and there
you are. Also, brother Johnson has hit up the fare
on his cars for the White City to threepence each way.
Which is causing a lot of very fried language.
P.S.: Bilanderson may yet recover his sunken
treasure, or a lump of it. He owns the freehold of
Wonderland and there are quite a lot of possibilities
about the property.
Michael Joseph, for many years on the roads as
manager for William Anderson, and recently with
the Fraser Film Co. in Melbourne, has been pro-
moted to the Sydney end of the latter’s business.
Incidentally, Michael will give an eye or two to
the Imperial Picture Theatre.
The Pictures Combine is going to have a rival in
the Fraser Film Release Co., which has an exchange
arrangement with Tyler, of London. In N. S.
Wales alone the co. is supplying 41 shows, and has
distributing branches in Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne
and Maoriland. It offers local men encouragement,
and in the past nine months has produced eight
of their picture-stories; the best of them will go
on to the London exchange. Franklyn Barrett, who
did good work for Pat he in the South Seas and
on the whaling grounds below Australia, has been
despatched on a two years’ tour for the co., to
collect material with his cino-camera. His trip
will take in India, Egypt, Europe, Great Britain
and America.
One can read all about the cantankerous
worker and the contemptuous way he flouts
the Arbitration law in the Melbourne
Argus, the Sydney Telegraph or the Ade-
laide Register ; but it is necessary to do
some further searching to find the employer’s
delinquencies. One source of information is
the N. S. Wales Industrial Gazette,
issued by the Labor Department. In the
November number, amongst, the records of
proceedings before industrial magistrates
during September, a procession of default-
ing employers transpires. In 11 cases,
offenders were ordered to shell out to em-
ployees who had been underpaid. In about 90
cases fines were inflicted on the boss for
miscellaneous breaches of awards, mostly for
forgetting to pay the minimum wage and
remembering to keep the toiler going after
the prescribed number of hours. In some-
thing like 30 cases he was fined for failure to
exhibit copies of awards ; and in about half
a hundred other instances penalties were
dragged from him for not keeping time-sheets
and pay-sheets so that the Law could occa-
sionally see that all was square and reason-
ably honest.
Thus Sydney Telegraph last week: —
What use are Labor candidates’ promises? It is
the Labor Conference which decides.
As a matter of fact, the alleged Labor
Government did its best to please the Tele-
graph by repudiating the Labor Conference
and breaking the platform which that paper
abhors. And now the paper turns on the
obliging Ministry, and urges its readers to
slaughter it. What does the Telegraph
want, anyhow?
Victoria is witnessing the old farce. Willy
Watt, having failed to command a majority
on one small item of his policy, has resigned
his job of Premier, whereupon, of course,
every other Minister has also resigned his
job ; and the Labor leader has been called on
to form a Ministry. This he is doing at the
moment of writing, with the full knowledge
that there isn’t a majority in the House that
will support his policy. With extra luck he
may pull through for a few weeks, and then,
probably on some utterly unimportant detail,
the House will throw the new arrival out,
and some other person will be sent for.
Under the Party-Government system, a
majority may approve of 99 things that a
Ministry proposes; but if it tosses out the
100th, there is “a defeat of the Government,”
and the Government is expected to file out
and make room for some other crowd. This
is a good deal like sacking all the Judges of
the Supreme Court because the opinion of
one of them has been upset by the High
Court, or dismissing the housemaid and the
gardener because the cook turned out a pie
that wasn’t up to specifications.
TOSTI’S “GOOD BOY.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Falling leaf, and fading tree.
Lines of white in a sullen sea.
And a woman singing “Good-bee! Good-bee!”
The swallows are making them ready to fly,
Wheeling out on a windy sky.
Oh, hear her crying, “Gud-bye! Gud-bye!”
Hush! a voice from the far away!
“Listen and learn,” it seems to say.
But they never do! (“Good-bay! Good-bay!”)
The cord is frayed, the cruse is dry,
The link must break, and the lamp must die.
Goo’-bye to Hope! Goo’-bye ! Goo’-bye !
What are we waiting for? Oh! my heart!
Kiss me straight on the brows ! And part!
(My singing lesson is due to start.)
What are we waiting for, you and Oi?
A pleading look, a stoifled croi—
“Good’boy, forever! Good-boy, forever! Good-
boy!” (Wild applause.)

THE UNPARDONABLE SIN.
HE : “For Heaven s sake, woman, stop that
perpetual nagging. If you keep on much
longer I'll shoot myself."
SHE: “ You do, you wretch! You dare fire
off a revolver in this house! You’ll wake
THE BABY.”
“Spud”: Was amongst a mob fighting a.
grass and crop fire yesterday. We had got
it under, and about 20 of us were sitting
under a tree having a spell, all singed,
sweaty and very dry. There wasn’t a water-
bag or a drop of neck-oil between us. After
a spasmodic yarn or two and a few lies, a
gloomy silence settled over the perspiring
company. While thirsty thoughts of past
pints and future foaming tankards were
running through the collective mind of the
company, one ragged, unwashed, grimy
gentleman asked: “Who’s in favor of the
pubs closin’?” Sickly grins and silence gave
eloquent reply. Has Archdeacon Boyce ever
helped to put out a bush fire?
Melbourne City Council is said to be medi-
tating a crusade against the semi-transparent
skirt, with a view to the immediate suppres-
sion of any suggestion of legs on the lower
end of perambulating ma’ams and maidens.
At the same time a press item calls attention
to an interesting display of female legs in
the window of a city shop. The latter limbs
are artificial, and have been actually built
by public subscription to fit a young woman
who was deprived of her natural members
after a railway accident. The hand-made
legs are commended in the press paragraph
for their astonishing naturalness in appear-
ance and action. “At first glance one might
easily be deceived,” says the enthusiastic re-
porter. The Bulletin wants to know what
Hennessy is going to do about it. If the
living woman mustn’t show dim. shadowy
calves through her lower drapings, why
should deceptive, factory-built limbs, uphol-
stered in real hide, be displayed before the
people, naked and unashamed? This paper
demands that opaque skirts be put over the
artificial shins, or that Hennessy arrest them
at once for being a visible means of support.
* * * *
From a rebellious Young Person: —
Every little while Melbourne is troubled by an
outbreak of the Interfering Person. In the summer
he becomes particularly virulent and tries to vac-
cinate us all with the Seven Deadly Virtues. Just
now he has his eye on the diaphanous maiden and
her lack of clothing. This maiden must feel almost
important as she sheds an extra petticoat, for the
Legislative Assembly and the City Council are both
giving serious thought to her shortcomings. Indeed,
the Council is threatening to pass a regulation em-
powering its myrmidons to see that her clothing is
sufficient and respectably thick. Apart from the
rush likely to be caused by applicants eager for
the job, surely the remedy of submitting every
woman to the inspectorship of policemen with an
over-supply of conscience is worse than the disease.
And what really is the disease? Simply that women
want to be cool.
As a woman who objects'to stuffy clothing, I can
assure these timorous moralists _ that the average
woman has no desire to “tempt” them. There is
no base motive animating her when she cuts her
collar down and her skirt up. There may be a bit
of devilry in it; but the devil-may-care woman is
not the dangerous woman. The latter is the quiet,
mousey little person with the ingenuous expression
who wears black or pale-blue and says “Fancy!”
No ; the average woman has not sufficient imagination
to make her clothing what Garvice would call “seduc-
tive.” Gaby Deslys are rare and —well-paid. As for
the so-frequent girl you can see through, invariably
the thrill she causes is quite unpremeditated. It
needs quite a number of underskirts to hide a sugges-
tion of limb beneath a white frock, particularly when
the lighting-effects are on the side of the bad man.
The average girl, in the average narrow skirt, can’t
walk with a lot of petticoats catching round her
legs, and that is the secret of the scandal. But why
should she cause such an outcry ? Is it immoral to
have legs?
Certainly there is a charm and a suggested femin-
inity about thin garments; but, seriously, do they
cause as much vice as they are given credit for?
The callow youth thinks it “hot,” and nudges the
block puppy with him, and they both bark nasty
little jokes. But is it worth while condemning
women to be thrust into hot, stuffy clothes just to
save the mean little souls of the puppies? Public
opinion might be much better occupied in trying to
educate the male half of itself to a healthier idea
of sex-cleanliness. Given clean, frank men, a girl
would be safe from cheap jokes. And, oh, the
pleasure of the wind on your flesh!
Two amateur detectives who had jumped
through a worldling’s window, in the course
of their supposed duty, have been cautioned,
in a friendly way, at Glebe (Sydney),, by
the magistrate who was hearing a charge of
threatening language preferred against the
said worldling by one of the jumpers—an
evangelist appropriately named Hopper.
The window-owner told the Bench that he
was the uncle of a girl who had fled from
her father’s grocery store in Balmain “be-
cause she was being forced into a loveless
marriage.” (This part of the story should
be told in verse.) He had taken her in,
and, as the girl did not want to let her
father know where she was, he had not
spread the nev/s. The two evangelists here
come loping into the story like bloodhounds.
They shadowed the uncle for three weeks,
and the uncle’s nerves wore thin under the
strain. Wherever he went, he saw an
evangelist peering at him. If he stepped
backward to avoid a tram, an evangelist
wriggled from under his feet. He asserted
that, at the time, he had not the slightest
idea what they were after. (This sounds
incredible, but the witness was an innocent
railway porter and a poor guesser.) At
last he met his shadows face to face, and
asked them fiercely what they wanted.
They said they wanted to find out where the
girl was. Thereupon he threatened to tear
Hopper to pieces, or words to that effect.
However, the shadows leant up against
themselves, proceeded valorously to the front
door of the furious uncle’s castle and ham-
mered on the portcullis. Being refused ad-
mission there, they hurried round the back
and jumped, for the glory of God, through
his window. Then the fugitive niece was
somehow transferred to the care of the rev-
erend who presided over Hopper’s mission,
and the long, risky fight was won. Presum-
ably the uncle’s patience and ingenuity were
exhausted. Shadows may be avoided or
scared off, but a porter with bells to ring
and expresses to dodge can do no more than
leave flypapers about, and such things are
no good at all against a plague of leaping
evangelists.
RECOGNISED.
HOSTESS: “Mr. Jones! Of course! I had quite forgotten your name, but I couldn’t
forget your face."
“Alpha Centauri”: Re ships that are
permitted to leave Australian ports inade-
quately officered (B. 6/11/T3). A British
steamer arrived in Penang from Newcastle
in July, 1910, with only one person (the
master) on board who knew enough about
navigation to guide her from port to port.
The first mate was a Scandinavian with
an American license, and the second mate
had quite forgotten all his navigation, hav-
ing just left a job in a coal mine where
he had been working for about five years.
Moreover, there was only one man on board
among the sailors who could steer within a
handful of points. On one occasion during
the voyage the helmsman (not the good
one) was asked if he had ever steered be-
fore, to which he replied: “I have never
been on a boat before.” I cannot under-
stand why the Department of Navigation
allows a steamer to leave port without a
qualified chief officer, at any rate.
“Scarehead”: All this talk about White
Slavery has revived the imaginative female
who hurries home and thrills the hot, red-
tiled suburban villa with the news that some
wretch covered all over with diamonds
looked at her in a meaning way while she
was waiting for the tram. Sometimes she
adds that she nearly killed him with the look
she gave him. Judging by these yarns, the
white slavers are frightfully eager to cap-
ture maiden aunts who, if not actually un-
insurable, are undoubtedly posted on the
marriage market as “overdue,” The aston-
ished relatives of these ladies are solemnly
warned by the prospective victims them-
selves that they may be carried off kicking
at any moment, unless the menfolk of the
circle do their duty like gentlemen and pro-
vide adequate escort to and from every
pottering tea-party. So the suburbs are
traversed nightly by scared women of
mature age under a guard of reluctant
brothers and nephews. Curiously enough,
the married women and the flappers don’t
seem to be worrying any more than usual;
but the old maids and half-old maids are
dead sure that some handsome beast is only
waiting for a chance to throw a chloro-
formed blanket over their heads and rush
their limp forms in a fast motor to the
wharf, where a specially-chartered lugger
is waiting with steam up. It seems to be
too good to be true that the white slaver
will spend thousands and loiter darkly for
months, in order to give some fading lady
a piercing glance as she hurries virtuously
home from a jumble fair. That is all he
ever seems to do, confound him !
Councillor Ginn, of Prahran (Vic.), de-
nounces the confectionery shops as simply
meeting-places for undesirable young men
and women. There goes our last hope! We
ventured to believe the ordinary damsel and
the commonplace young man might agree to
come together in the establishment where
lurk the pensive penny bun and the long,
innocuous milk-shake without inviting the
suspicions of the godly. We were wrong.
The crumpet, too, is corrupt, the 3d. ice is an
engine of Hell —although it doesn’t look it —
and the insidious jam tart maketh also for
unrighteousness.
RIFLE PRACTICE.
INSTRUCTOR: “Well, boy, what's up with your
rifle? ”
CADET : “ Please, sir, you listen. The trigger
clicks all right, but the cartridge won't
go off."
Over a year ago Weary Willy Watt
promised to provide £BOOO for a hospital at
Wonthaggi, on condition that guarantees
were given that no further claim would be
made for its maintenance. Possibly he
assumed that the guarantees wouldn’t be
forthcoming, and that he needn’t) bother any
more about the matter. But they were
forthcoming, 3000 State miners levying on
themselves to the extent of per week •
nearly £lOOO a year—to provide the money.
No hospital has, however, arrived, nor any
signs of one ; and now the nurses attending
to the patients in the weatherworn, dilapi-
dated tents threaten to strike if something
isn’t done.
SHOULD LAWYERS LIE?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Should lawyers lie?’’ was the subject of a debate
at the annual congress of the German Barristers’
Association at Breslau.... The conference resolved it
was inadmissible for a lawyer to set up a deliber-
ately untruthful contention.
Should lawyers lie?
I heard Gent One who cried: “By Six and Eight,
Is naught to-day then held inviolate?
Must we be shorn of right and privilege won,
And handed down from bleeding sire to son,
To please a paltry purist gang, forsooth,
Who pose as sticklers for immortal Truth?
What mannered man was he who ventured first
to e’er propound a question so accurst —
Should lawyers lie?
“Should lawyers lie?
The caitiff who could raise up doubts like this
Would sell his Master with a Judas kiss ;
Would soon go asking, with as little ruth,
‘D’ye think, good folk, should lawyers tell the
truth?’
If lying be forbid ’tis surely plain
The end has come of craft and old chicane,
And Time must choke with mighty little fuss
Our pleadings and our precedents and vs
And ev’ry lie.
“Should lawyers lie?
Should politicians drop their daily rant?
Should Chadband fling the dogs his sickly cant ?
Should quacks be made to swallow drug and bolus,
And ev’ry fraud gulp down his gruel, solus?
Why, such a matter goes, as all can see,
Bight to the roots of our Society;
And he whose fingers poke in such a pie
Will wish he’d dropped the wherefore and the why,
When round his head the wasps of Privilege fly!
Should lawyers lie !”

Postmaster-General Wynne, on the aa-
vice of Balsillie, is going ahead of the world
in taking evidence on the extension of wire-
less telegraph}’ for general work in Aus-
tralia. The enormous cost of poles and
wires checks extension over the magnificent
distances of the backblocks ; hence the hun-
ger to make a trial of a system
that can do without poles and wires. The
idea is to connect up with the 19 high-
power coast stations; and Balsillie,
who says the scheme is quite feasible, has
been instructed to go ahead. He reckons
the cost of equipping the experimental sta-
tions, with a radius of from 50 to 100
miles, at £lOO apiece. Ten or 12 will be
ready in six weeks to prove their practic-
ability or otherwise; and their success will
mean the netting-up of all Australia.
“Melb ”: An ugly, blotchy, patchy affair
called St. James’s Church is being put up
on the corner of King-street and Batman-
street, in the northerly part of the city.
This is the resurrection of St. James’s Old
Cathedral —old wine in new bottles ; a grue-
some mixture, the Outcome of an idea on the
part of Archbishop Clarke, Archdeacon Hind-
ley and Dean Stephen that they are repro-
ducing the venerable “first church.” It is
like Temple Bar, which is stuck up in the
Meux family park of Theobalds, or the
Yankee millionaire transplanting an old
English ruined abbey to America. How-
ever, the real St. James’s site is all to be
available for the building of warehouses, to
the fattening of the Church —and the glori-
fying of God, no doubt. So why worry
about another monstrosity more or less?
MEETING HIM.
CUSTOMER: “Yes, the suit's all right, hut
I'm afraid I shan't live to wear it out."
ISRAEL: “No madder, my poy. I vill alviz
take dem hack at a reasonable retuction.
The cockies who cantered blithely into
the Maoriland cities from the country to
patrol the streets with waddies and lump
“black” cargo and do odd jobs for the more
or less paralysed shipping cos. and , . m '
ployers’ Federation begin to find that things
are not nearly as satisfactory as they might
be. In the excitement of the first few days,
following the change from out-back to a big
city, the cocky felt that everything in the
garden was a peach. He read long screeds
of guff in the Tory newspapers that he was
the hero of the hour and the splendid barrier
between a helpless community and an army
of ravening incendiaries. And he liked it —
liked it so much that he didn’t mind where
he “pigged” it. He slept on heaps of straw
in long rows in draughty sheds and ate any
old thing that was handed out. Still,- it
looked well in the illustrated press—for a
while. Then it began to pall, particularly
when coal-shovelling and heavy wharf work
started to be plentiful. The familiar growl
of the cocky presently arose and was pro-
lific about the treatment he wasn’t receiving
in the way of accommodation. But nobody
took much notice of his complaints. What
he was getting, it was agreed by tactical
silence, was good enough for him and the
job he was doing. In fact, it was too
good ; so much so that some of the employ-
ing firms proposed to charge him for his
doss and his meals. It’s a pity gratitude
is so expensive.

“Nemo”: Judge Box has been talking to
the lady barristers who propose practising
in Melbourne on the subject of the clothes
they ought to wear in court. He does not
think they should wear wigs, because these
would be inconvenient and a burlesque. But
he says they ought to have some distinctive
gown, so that the barrister conducting a
case may be known from a party to the
suit or a witness. He suggested a confer-
ence on the subject between the lady bar-
risters and the Law Institute. Justice
Isaacs, of the Federal High Court, has a
daughter as his associate, and she dresses
just like Portia in the “Merchant of
Venice.” That’s the nice, graceful style that
the lady practitioners ought to adopt. One
wonders what the late Justice Redmond
Barry, of the Melbourne Supreme Court,
who was such a stickler for form and cus-
tom, would about it all. I was present
in court one day in the long ago, when the
weather was very hot, and a barrister
removed his wig and laid it on the bar-
table before him. “Are we in Court f”
promptly asked the horrified Judge. Where-
upon the disgruntled barrister resumed
his horse-mnf, and muttered that he
hoped they would “soon get rid of all this
nonsense.” But they haven’t got two steps
towards it yet; and that was well-on to 50
years ago.
On very good authority it is said that
quite a different man from the eminent
horse-doctor Gilruth would have got the job
of looking after the
Northern Territory had
he not stated in his appli-
cation-tihat he was unmar-
ried. Fisher was set on
having a Benedict in the
billet; but the likely
applicant wasn’t made
aware of that fact, other-
wise the impediment
might have been removed.
When barrister Dowling,
afterwards N.S.W. Dis-
trict Court Judge, was
appointed Judge Advo-
cate of North Australia
by Governor Fitzroy, he
was unmarried, but the
Governor knew that.
Dowling, who wasn’t do-
ing much at the Bar at
the time, and was living
in a little room in Phillip-
street, thanked the Gov-
ernor heartily. “Don’t
tell me you are not mar-
ried,” said the diplomatic
Governor. “You see my
instructions are to ap-
point a married man. Of
course you’re married.”
“Well, ah” began the
truthful lawyer. “Now,
now,” said Fitzroy, “you
can probably find a lady.”
“Probably,” said the law-
yer. And Dowling records
that he went to the daugh-
ter of Commissary Laid-
ley, proposed to her, and
was promptly married, the
pair sailing with Barney
to Gladstone to help found the new colony.
The foaming beaker, which had a habit
of arriving at the side door when the mouth
of a constable was handy, has received sen-
tence of death in Melbourne, and the in-
dignant cry of the aggrieved John Hop is
loud in the land. To anyone with whom he
has a passing acquaintance he has been
pouring out his tale of woe. It seems that
Chief Commissioner Sainsbury has issued
an edict, ukase or something similar, prohi-
biting his men from entering hotels while
in uniform; and as Sainsbury is be-
coming as sensitive as a maiden aunt about
the morals of the Force, John fears that
he means the order to be taken very literally.
And the hot weather coming on, too!
Melb. City Fathers have at last decided to
abolish that shrieking abomination, the hub
brake on waggons, lorries, etc., and have ex-
pressed their intention of dealing with those
other outrages, motor horns, when they get
authority from Parliament. Meanwhile,
The Bulletin directs their earnest atten-
tion to jangling bells, inartistic hoardings.,
grotesque statues, barking dogs and people
who burn leather; and when they have fin-
ished off that lot it will provide another list
of offenders against the gospel of sweetness
and beauty. In fact, it can undertake to
keep the City Council in work for quite a
long while.
Another story of these splendid backblocks
Australians. Away back in the heart of
Gippsland (Vic.) a horse lashed out at a
settler’s wife, and the unfortunate woman
fell dreadfully injured. As bad luck would
have it, there had just been some heavy falls
of rain, and the bush tracks were too heavy
for any wheeled vehicle; consequently the
patient seemed doomed to take her chance in
the wilderness. The Bush Nurse was known
to be somcwnere in the district, and a special
messenger galloped through the forest until
he had located her. She hurried along
to the patient, but, after doing what she
could, said that surgical treatment was re-
quired and the patient’s life could only be
saved by getting her to Sale Ilosnital, TO
miles away. The farmers gathered at the
call, and, the roads being closed, agreed to
carry the sufferer the whole distance on a
stretcher, working in shifts of four. The
tremendous job, which included the fording
of three swollen streams, took four days ; but
the farmers reached Sale with the patient
holding on to life bravely. At latest she
was convalescent.

A budding White Slave novelist was dis-
covered lying on a pavement (she’d probably
have done it just as heartily anywhere else)
atToorak (Melb.) last week. When she had
been restored to consciousness she turned out
to be one of the great Brown family, and the
owner of a staggering tale. She had been
to the out-door department of the Mel-
bourne Hospital, she said, and on her way
home had met a weeping woman who was
faint with grief over the desertion of her
husband. She led the matron down a side
street to where her motor-car was waiting—
all deserted wives have motor-cars in the
next street —and helped her in. Very
naturally she took a seat, too. Then the car
drove rapidly to a muddy river, where
tlie lady left off being distressed and covered
her with a revolver while the caitiff who
drove the car drugged her. That’s all she
knew till she came-to in the hands of the
police. The hardened Law showed signs of
disbelief and called in a doctor, who could
find no signs of a struggle, no evidence of
drugging—nothing, in fact, but a large
atmosphere of doubt. However, the girl
stuck to her yarn, until she began to see
holes in it. Then, suddenly breaking up, she
admitted that it was all a fable to hide the
alleged fact that she had gone for a three-
hours’ joy-ride with a strange motorist who
had tried to kiss her and had bumped her
out when she resisted. Though that yarn
was probably as true as the other, the police
left it at that. This time, in her youthful
inexperience, she laid on the descriptive
orush too heavily ; next time, when she
knows better what to avoid, she will pro-
bably get some innocent man five years’
hard. »

Melbourne’s coroner Cole risked his life
by going boating on the Yarra one night
recently. He admitted the indiscretion a
few days later during the inquest on Mar-
garet Spence, a picnic girl who was drowned
in the perilous stream near Hawthorn, while
coming home with a boating party. The
control of the Yarra was vested in the Ports
and Harbors branch of the Public Works
Department in 1909; but all the P.W.D.
has done has been to draft some regulations
and put up some mooring posts. Nobody
seems to know who should attend to the
lighting of the stream, or the job of cutting
back the treacherous willows which over-
hang it and help to make the sinuous,
. snaggy stream a liquid tunnel of gloom. So
the boating parties after dark take their
chance —and it is a very ugly chance when
there is an undue proportion of fools in the
party. There is sure to be at least one fool
who will suggest driving the overloaded boat
under the willows so that the other boats of
the party may pass and wonder what is the
matter; and if there are two other fools to
say it’s a ripping idea, the thing is done.
The river seems to attract people like that,
and it should be made as safe as possible for
them. A dead fool is of no use to anyone ;
he can be put to even less good purpose than
a live fool.
ONLY PARTLY BAFFLED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The police are, therefore, to a certain extent baffled.
—Police report in a missing-girl case.
Not absolutely baffled, understand !
They are not yet “completely in the dark” ;
A red-hot clue may yet be close at hand —
A clue that will blaze up, if briskly fanned.
But where to find it? Therein lies the nark.
Not “at a loss.” That indicates the end
Of heavy searching and official thought.
Still, here and there inquiring policemen wend,
And plain-clothes men their little leisure spend
In wond’ring dimly where she may be caught.
Not outed yet! Some consciousness remains!
Their feet move slowly and their eyes are glazed ;
Tremors of thought still flicker through their brains,

FOR THE BULLETIN
WHENE'ER mv angel walks the street
. Enraptured people see
A vision garbed in raiment neat
Who steps most daintily!
Strong' men would die to win one curl *
And yet I shall , not wed the girl,
Though beautiful is she!
She is not someone else’s bride,
Nor does she favor show
To one more blest (if such betide
I’d swiftly lay him low!).
,’Tis just because, you’ll understand,
Each time I ask her for her hand
She firmly answers, “No!”

In opposition, or in the freedom of
a private member, Mr. W'att might have
been described as an earnest dema-
gogue, eager to reform the world, anti
marching valiantly always with the pro-
gressive thought of Australia. In
power, however, his line is that of the
least resistance—his philosophy, "heave
things alone"; his action, a timid
anxiety to placate only the most conser-
vative elements of liis heterogeneous
following. Mr. Watt is a tiger only for
show purposes.

Will Dyson was one of the speakers at an
enormous meeting held in Albert Hall. Lon-
don, on October 10, to support the Dublin
-strikers. Other speakers were Jim Larkin,
Keir Hardie, Ben Tillett, and the Countess
of Warwick. The New Age picks Dyson
• out as the pithiest and wittiest speaker of
the bunch. In fact, Dyson has become so
popular a speaker in the Labor cause that
there is some danger of an excellent carica-
turist being spoilt to make a commonplace
politician.
The family of Frederic Chappie, of Ade-
laide, ought to come about first in any Aus-
tralian competition for multitude of
University degrees. The father, who for 37
years has been headmaster of Prince Alfred
'College, is a 8.A., B.Sc. Of four sons and
•four daughters six are graduates of Adelaide
’Varsity in arts, science, surgery or medi-
cine, and several in two or more of them.
Two sons and one daughter follow medicine;
and another son is lecturer on engineering
at Cambridge, w r here three sons have gradu-
ated.
Each of the five Federal Parliaments has
had its funerals. In the first Frederick Sar-
good, F. W. Piesse and W. H. Groom died.
Edward Braddon went during the second
Parliament. The third saw the deaths of a
trio of valuable South Australians —Fred
Holder, C. C. Kingston and James Hutchi-
son. In the fourth Parliament, the victims
were William Russell, E. L. Batchelor, G.
B. Edwards and LI. E. Beard. Thus early
in the life of the fifth House, C. E. Frazer
and E. A. Roberts have paid the price.
Barring gloomy Glynn, the most melan-
choly-mannered person in the Reps, nowa-
days is ex-Senator Best, of Kooyong (Vic.),
whom the youthful Biakey beat for third
place at the 1010 Senate poll. Ever since
the Cookoo unsuccessfully solicited him to
sell the frazzled remains of his political birth-
right, offering him in return a portfolio
with a string to it, Best has drooped. But
nobody cares. Best is not popular with his
own party, having slumped a good deal since
those happier times when his gaud was new
and a Ministerial billet kept dropping a
dollar or so into his pocket every hour of the
day and night.
Randolph Bedford concerning his friend
C. E. Frazer :
I protest against the. vociferous “truth-telling” of
“0.K.” (B. 4/12/’ 13) on my good friend Charles E.
Frazer, deceased. According to “0.K.,” Frazer died
of “devotion to whisky,” and it is a “conspiracy
of misrepresentation” not to state the alleged fact
with a megaphone. Frazer was an Australian who
at 14 was a newsboy, at 23 entered the Federal
Parliament and at 30 was a Minister. His quick
success didn’t swell his head, which is more than
could happen to any Englisher of the same age. His
one fault was the fault of a boon companion—a big-
headed, generous, kindly and gregarious man, who
carried his failing publicly, so that it was frank
enough to become scandalous in the eyes of thinner-
blooded men. How was it an “open secret” that
Frazer would be left out of the next Labor Govern-
ment, when most Laborites knew that the
“respectable” but utterly ridiculous O’Malley lowered
the party prestige, while Frazer never lost it a vote?
The very next paragraph is adulation of one Atkins
—a more or less meritorious fish-oil merchant from
England who at the age of 58 or so, and after iriany
tries, got a few hundred people to select him to
the Melbourne municipal council. The mere shop-
keeping device of an exhibition Of Australian goods
and of window dressing with Australian manufactures
is placed to the credit of the municipal bore as if
it were the re-discovery of the New World. But
the kindly, capable Australian who became a Minister
at 30 is followed with exaggerated “truth-telling”
of his one failing. A living ass may be greater than
a dead lion; certainly the ass brays more vociferously
than the lion could roar when in robust health.
The late E. A. Roberts, M.H.R., though
a Jingo in some respects—he went twice to
the Boer war- —held just as strong views
about the monarchy as Gordon Webber, the
M.L.A. of Victoria. Years ago he delivered
a rousing address to the school children at
Gladstone (S.A.). At the conclusion the
chairman started the National Anthem, and
to the stodgy person’s astonishment Roberts
refused to honor it. The local bank
manager thereupon pulled off E.A.’s hat as
punishment for his “disloyalty.” Perhaps
to atone for it all, after staggering under
the blow of Death into the Queen’s Hall, he
died clutching at Queen Victoria’s statue.

Mrs. Mary Ann Thornton, who died re-
cently, was Mayoress of Sydney as far back
as 1857 ; her husband, George, was the first
Mayor when the corporation was revived
after its early smash. Her father was John
Solomon, who kept the old Albion Inn when
she was born —a quaint house of the early
Macquarie era. The Albion wharf and
stores were opposite. John Solomon also
had the license of the Hole in the Wall, in
Pitt-street, and moved about among other
ancient pubberies until he went out of busi-
ness in the ’4U 7 s.
THE AUTOMATON V THE THINKER.
One phase of the N.S. W. elect ions.—A win
for the machine system.
“Everard Digges la Touche” is a signa-
ture which is becoming familiar in the Syd-
ney dailies when any ecclesiastical rumpus
is forward; and the Christians are loving
one another more vigorously than usual. It
is owned by six feet of hot-headed Hiberni-
anism, aged about 30, and possessed of
ah infectious smile and a boyish geniality
which win their way even in quarters
where their owner’s opinions are anathema.
Digges la Touche is an Anglican parson
who came to this country in search of sal-
vation from lung trouble, and was brought
to Sydney from Emmaville (N.S.W.) a few
months ago by Archbishop Wright as “dio-
cesan missioner and lecturer.” His contro-
versial shillelagh is never long quiet, but its
hardest whacks are reserved for rationalists,
“High” churchmen, Labor politicians and
poor old Pope Pius X. Digges won brilliant
honors at Trinity College, Dublin, where he
was Donnellan Lecturer —a fact of which
he is fond of reminding the public.
General Bramwell Booth, of the Salv’-
army, and brother Ballington have been
reconciled. The old General had three
sons—Bramwell, Ballington and Herbert.
The last two have been in Australia, and
Bramwell is coming next year. The row
between General Booth and Ballington
occurred this way. About four years is the
usual term for a “Commander” in one
region. Ballington having done nearly nine
in America, the General ordered him to
move on. Sonny refused. The General
temporised a little. He sent Herbert, from
Canada, to confer. Ballington continued
rusty. Then the General sent Nicol, with
Evangeline Booth, from England, with plain
instructions to oust the rebel. Ballington
responded by summoning a meeting of officers
at the New York headquarters, and refus-
ing admittance to Evangeline. But Nicol
put her in through a back window, or some-
how, and she appeared on the scene while
Ballington was making a fiery speech to the
officers, extolling the glories of Independent
America. Evangeline replied with a flaming
oration on behalf of the Dear Old General,
and she won. Ballington then started the
Christian Volunteers ; but they have been a
failure —which is probably why sonny comes
back to the fold.
The dramatic death of E. A. Roberts was
a fitting finish to a life spent under the
limelight. He succeeded in anything he
turned his hand to, but especially in poli-
tics, and he might have gone any distance.
He turned up on the wharves at Port Pirie
(5.A.,) in 1888, aged about 20, with four-
years of seafaring behind him, and evidently
an unusually good education behind that.
He admitted having “run away to sea” from
an English home. Presently he was secre-
tary to the wharf-laborers’ union, and man-
ager of a co-operative bakery. At 28 he
was in the S.A. Assembly, where he dis-
tinguished himself as one of the few men
not afraid of Kingston. He studied law, but
dropped it after having got some way on,
and tried journalism. He went to the Boer
war twice, once as a S.A. lieutenant and
again as a Victorian adjutant. Then he got
back into S.A. Parliament, and finally suc-
ceeded Kingston as member for Adelaide in
the Federal Reps. As a debater he was
surpassed only by Hughes in the House of
Reps., and his brief spell as honorary Min-
ister in the last Labor Government was
believed on all hands to be the opening
of a brilliant Cabinet career. But there
was a constitutional weakness of the heart;
and too strenuous work at his Parliamentary
job robbed the party of the services of one
of the pluckiest men the movement ever
knew.

From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
Dr. James Frederick Palmer (B. 4/12/’l3l , v „„
Mayor of Melbourne in 1845, when an Orano-e anf l
Green riot took place. The headquarters of Oran-e-
-lsm were at a pub on the N.E. corner of Little
Bourke-street and Queen-street. Here the “Yellows"
assembled at one o’clock, and pushed three purnle
flags through the upstairs front windows. That was
quite enough for the “Greens,” who were soon up
in arms. The row was not confined to sticks and
stones; firearms were also used. The Town Council
was sitting—Melbourne was n,'' a city then—and
post haste Dr. Palmer, the Mayor, waddled up with
the Riot Act. By this time the besiegers had gained
entrance and were wrecking the hotel. Palmer got
half-""’'’ ’ P the stairs, read the Riot Act, and then
cleared for his life. Some soldiers were called up
and camped between the parties, and things then
calmed down. With responsible government came
two Houses of Parliament. In the Council it was
decided to onen with praver. The Assembly, led bv
John O’Shanassy, rejected the proposal. Palmer, in
Court costume, would waddle in, flop on his knees
against the “wool sack,” his back to his “audience.”
and scamper through some form of supplication, in
the queer old man took his only holiday, a trip
to line-land. In his absence Mathew Hervey was
acting-President of the Council. This Hervey at one
time occupied with sheep 90 miles of frontage to the
River Murray; yet he died actually from want of
food. At least so said medical evidence and a
coroner’s iurv.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"Sailor-songs find no acceptance among sailors
themselves. “Nancy Qee” is anathema ; so is “The
Midshipmite.”— Musical Times.
O messmate, do not warble me the tunes about the
sea;
Not “Larboard Watch” nor “Anchor’s Weighed,” nor
good old “Nancy Lee” ;
Don’t roll a deep-sea chantey out an’ fill the weary
night
With songs about a sailor-boy at Copenhagen’s fight;
Just let us ’ave a ditty
Of a girl back in a city,
And other coves can chorus of the capstan if they
will,
But pass the old sea-ballad if yer want to pleasure
Bill!
I’ve ’eard “The Bay of Biscay” till my soul was sad
an’ sick,
And known ’em hymn “Tom Bowling” till their
throats was dry and thick ;
The lass that loves a sailor is a lass we all adore,
But if you go to sing it, mate, I’m streakin’ for the
door ;
Strike up a marchin’ measure,
Or a song of loot and treasure ;
But salt an’ sea an’ biscuit is a mortal bitter pill,
So pass the old sea-ballad if yer want to pleasure
Bill.
The sea is England’s glory! So? Well, mate, it
isn’t mine;
I’d rather find a glory underneath my fig an’ vine ;
And if you’re matchin’ voices at “A Hundred
Fathoms Deep,”
Or trollin’ ancient ditties of “The Towers along the
Steep,”
Just let me savv.v rightly,
And I’ll take my leave politely ;
The sailor’s lot’s a noble one, of course; I know it
still.
But pass the old sea-ballad if yer want to pleasure
Bill.
The men who ship before the mast are mostly left
behind ;
The sea’s a bad old witch who whops ’er children
blue and blind ;
The “’Earts of Oak” I meet to-day they damn their
’eads of wood,
And swear they’d leave the “deck o’ fame” instanter
if they could ;
But Davy Jones’s locker
On a wave will be their rocker ;
It’s best to state the bloomin’ facts without an inch
o’ frill—
So drop the old sea-ballad if yer want to pleasure
Bill.
Strike up with “Annie Laurie” or “The British
Grenadiers,”
With good old “Swanee River” or “The Last of
Many Beers” ;
But drop the fo’c’sT ditty with its Poll an’ Bet
an’ Sue—
The sea ’ath many beauties, but the sea ’ath ’ad its
due;
Let Bowline ’ave a rolic
And a chorus and a frolic,
But when ’e’s dropped the anchor, of the brine ’e’s
’ad a fill.
So pass the old sea-ballad if yer want to pleasure
Bill.
’E’s got a ’eart for simple joys, for rosy lad and lass ;
’E loves the chink of pewter an’ the jolly clink of
glass,
And Sally in our Alley always finds ’im smilin' soft,
Provided you don’t rouse ’em with the Soul that’s
Gone Aloft;
So quit the ocean breezy,
An’ you’ll find ’im sweet an’ easy;
Bring in the foamin’ tankard, an’ take care yer do
not spill—
But pass the old sea-ballad if yer want to pleasure
Bill!

The profits, though a shade less than for the previous
half-year, are magnificent. Still, these are times
when big profits might reasonably be expected.
Nearly every State in Australia has been borrowing
hard and spending lavishly, and that means inflated
prosperity, from which drapers, banks, land-su'odivi-
ders and the building trades get more benefit than
almost anybody else. The conditions which have
prevailed might very easily land the banks in trouble
by-and-bye; but the managements have, on the whole,
acted very cautiously. Yet, at the best, the most
prudent of them can scarcely escape some losses;
and whether these will make big holes in the visible
profits depends upon the undisclosed profits which
are being put by to meet such contingencies. Nobody
can tell from the published accounts what these con-
tingency funds or inner reserves amount to. Indeed
it is uncertain in most cases whether there are any
at all, though the Bank of N. S. Wales owns up to
“reserves held for doubtful debts and an investment
fluctuation account’’—included, by the way, among
the bills, etc. The point, then, is that it is not
safe to judge the future of any Australian bank by
its recent figures. Those figures are the firstfruits
of a boom. They are the exhilaration that comes from
a season of champagne. The losses, resulting from
advances made on inflated values, or to finance busi-
nesses that have given over-much credit, only turn
up later on when the boom has passed. They are
the headache in the morning and the reckoning with

The most cheerful thing about the Wales and
other big Australian banks is that, during these years
when it has been so easily possible to lay the founda-
tions for bad debts, they have been rapidly piling
up visible reserves—and, no doubt, some of them
have been piling up internal reserves, too. At the
same time a good many of them have also been add-
ing to their capital. Ten years ago the paid capital
of the B.N.S.W. was £2,000,000; it has just been
brought up to £3,500,000. The reserves, then
£1,348,442, are now £2,418,659. Meantime, the
dividend has never been put up beyond 10 p.c. ; and
as the public has settled down to the conviction that
10 p.c. is the limit, shares are never rushed up to
ridiculous heights. In other words, the majority of
the shareholders probably get quite as good a return
now as they would if the dividend was 171 p.c., as
it was for nearly 20 years prior to 1892. General-
manager Russell French hasn’t done a better thing
for the bank than in limiting the dividend to 10 p.c.
and strengthening the bank with the surplus profits.
In 10 years, as shown just now, over £1,000,000
has been added to the reserves, whereas in the 40
years down to 1890 less than £1,000,000 had been
accumulated. The whole difference lay in this:
whereas in the past half-year the 10 p c. div. allowed
of £81,155 being put by, in the last half of 1899
the p.c. absorbed £109,375 out of a total profit
of £119,838. No doubt about it, Australian banks
have changed their ways. One couldn’t conceive of
the Bank of N. S. Wales, for instance, paying out
now as it paid out in 1899. A further result of the
limiting of the dividend to 10 p.c. is that the share-
holders have vastly better security for their money
than they used to have. Bank shares were not gilt-
edged securities in and before the ’9o’s ; but they are
not far off it now. At the end of 1889, when the
17$ p.c. div. was being paid, the funds (capital and
reserves) represented £36 per share, and people
were paying £64 10s. for the shares. To-day, in-
cluding the new capital only just got in, the funds
represent £34 per share, and the market price is
£4l. So there is practically the same amount of
security to-day for £4l as a few years ago there
was for £64 10s.
Turning to the movements of the past year these
results show up :

The cash position is, as usual, very strong; a frac-
tion more than half of the total liabilities are held
in liquid form. This suggests that the bank is wait-
ing for the atmosphere to clear. Meantime, in view
of the shrinkage of deposits and the general ten-
dency to over-stock and over-trade, advances have
been called in to a considerable extent. This shows
how deposits and advances have moved during the
last few years:—

That movement in deposits is very significant: it
shows very plainly that we haven’t been travelling
in the right direction ; and the calling-in of advances
and a general reining-up was inevitable. It probably
hurt in some cases; but it was the right thing for
the bank and the right thing for the community.

This co., having pretty well got over its own
troubles, turned its attention to other building socie-
ties that were left more or less derelict by the col-
lapse of the boom bubble of the ’9o’s. At various
times it has taken over the Lygon Permanent, South
Melbourne, City of Prahran, Premier, Planet,
Economic and Melbourne Permanent; and the direc-
tors remark this year that the benefit of the pur-
chases is evident in the substantial increase in the
net earnings. Things, of course, favored the society:
good years and hard borrowing between them pro-
duced another boom in property values, and allowed
the Fourth Victoria to make quick sales and substan-
tial profits. Certainly it is still nursing a good deal
of the old remnants, as this next table shows: —

In 1900 its advances, foreclosed properties and other
freeholds made a total of ; £ 183,758, whereas now
these items amount to £568,806. Still, by far the
greater part of that is represented by advances,
which may be taken in most cases to mean unpaid
balances.' on properties sold; and as no doubt these
balances are being paid off by instalments, the longer
the present prosperous conditions last the wider will
the margin of safety be. What killed the building
societies in the bad old days was that the slump
came with tragic suddenness, before any great
amount of the purchase money had been paid off.
This time, though property values will certainly ease
off, there will be no sudden, tremendous slump,
because, while hard borrowing has had a lot to do
with the high values of late, it hasn’t been wholly
responsible for them. Also in the present boomlet
the hard foreign borrowing hasn’t been done by banks
and more-or-less financial institutions, but by the
State, and the State, even if it has to leave off
borrowing altogether, will not at any rate be called
upon to repay practically on demand', like the afore-
said banks and more-or-less financial institutions
were 20 years ago. And it was the demand for
instant repayment that did most of the damage.
Provided that the balances owing are not altogether
outrageous, The Bulletin doesn’t therefore expect
that the Fourth Victoria and others similarly situ-
ated will make heavy losses on these “advances.”
They may, in fact, escape loss altogether. But
with the tailing-off of the activity in the property
market they will inevitably show much reduced
profits. Stiil, the best of them expect that; where-
fore this society, though it has shown a profit of
£48,092 in the past two years, has very wisely kept
the dividend to a reasonable 8 p.c., absorbing
£16,617, and has used the balance either to write
down assets or to strengthen the reserves. Of the
reserves £9040 is a fund earmarked originally to
protect the valuation of remnants —that is, of proper-
ties of which portion only has been sold. This
fund used to be larger, but has been reduced to a
size considered “sufficient to meet anv contingencies
in realising the unsold properties.” Last year there
was no call on this reserve at all: on the contrary
£1653 fell into it —apparently profit of some sort.

The true profit for the year was £271 less than is
shown in the last line, that amount having been
refunded by the Taxation Commissioner, whose ruling
that share premiums should pay income ‘tax was not
received with favor by the courts. For once, any-
way, the law isn’t in conflict with common-sense and
sound finance. This reduction brings the true profits
for the year below the figure for 1910-11-12. To a
great extent this is due to higher costs of working.
Earnings from commission and interest were cer-
tainly a shade less than in the previous year; but
salaries and other exes, ran up nearly £5O0 —from
£5074 to £5544. This will doubtless be the com-
mon experience. For some years past property and
other values have been moving up, and the co. has
benefited, because it gets paid by way of commission
on (1) the capital value of estates, and (2) rent and
other earnings of estates. Expenses didn't move up
simultaneously; but now they are following the
other movement, and they will keep up even after
properties and rents are cheaper, and commissions are
consequently less. It is highly probable, then, that
profits will not be as good as they have been lately.
There has indeed been alreadv a check in the growth
of the trust estates, etc., in hand:—
1895 .. £482,987 | 1911 ..£2,388,695

1905 . . 1,413,953 | 1913 . . 2,541,379
1910 . . 2,309,316 j
The numbers for the past year are greater, but the
value is less than for 1912. Nevertheless, though the
shrinkage in property values and rents, which is
bound to come, will show itself in diminished earn-
ings, the general trend should be upwards, though
the progress may not be so quick as it was until
three years or so ago, when two local competitors
arrived in Adelaide. Still, even competitors have
their uses —each preaches the benefits of trustee cos.
in general, while dwelling on the virtues of itself in
particular. In any case, this co.’s present earnings
are so much in excess of the amount required to pay
10 p.c. that only wild mismanagement could put
the dividend in danger. Interest earnings alone came
to within £22 of the dividend last year, thus leav-
ing practically the whole of the profits from the busi-
ness to pile up in the shape of other revenue-produc-
ing assets. And the higher the pile gets the more
independent will the 10 p.c. div. be of the profits
from the business proper.

Even as they stand in the table, there is nothing
very depressing about the last few lines ; but they
don’t tell all that the unhappy shareholders have to
put up with. At the meeting the other day the
chairman moved that another 45,622 shares be
issued, and that £39,920 be lifted out of the re-
serves to pay for them—or the shareholders can take
the cash if they prefer it. They probably won’t
prefer it. True, there was a memo, at the foot of
ihe notice re the proposals to be submitted: “The
ordinary rate of dividend for some years past has
beui ID p.c. p.a., which on the present paid capital
amounts to £9124. In the ordinary course of
events the same amount, £9124, should be payable
on the capital (as increased) of £ 131,16 a, th..s
establishing the paid-up capital under the new
arrangement upon a 7 p.c. dividend basis instead of
10 p.c.’’ But the hope that springs eternal in the
human breast will certainly prompt the shareholder
to expect something more than 7 p.c. ; for he will
observe that, though the div. has been 10 p.c.,
bonuses have been frequent. Also, he will note that,
in nine years, while the 10 p.c. divs. and the cash
bonuses have been paid, the surplus profits have
amounted to £160,731, or about 44 times more than
the capital was 10 years ago. Not that this paper
expects that sort of thing to continue. Everything
lias conspired to make the Intercolonial boom. The
Government has been borrowing so hard that in three
'ears about £15,000,000 of money which this State
hasn’t earned has been spent. On top of that,
which of itself was enough to cause a boom, there
have been good seasons ; and the fruit of those good
seasons has, through the centralisation policy, been
uoured into Sydney. Then Protection, which fol-
lowed' on Federation, caused a demand for new
iactories ; and that meant a rush of builders, and a
-leady inflow of operatives. And the builders and
the operatives wanted homes; and the people who
had lived on the new factory sites wanted homes;
and people whose wages had gone up, mainly
on account of the partly-fictitious prosperity, wanted
to get married,: and they also wanted homes. So the
co. which subdivided land and gave assistance to
build was busier than it had been for about 25
vears. Simultaneously, it had another bit of re-
markable luck. Just when it wanted land to sub-
divide, the graduated land tax made its presence
felt, wherefore the land-retailer got his supplies
wholesale at a rate that no doubt surprised him. He
probably didn’t expect that the boom would last;
but the harder the Government borrowed and spent
the better it liked borrowing and spending, and a
little thing like high interest didn’t stand in the
way. When the co. sold allotments in the early days
of the boom it wrote the remnant down. Say it had
oaid_ £lO,OOO for a paddock and sold half of it in
subdivision for £12,000, it wouldn’t reckon that it
had made £7OOO. It would probably value the
unsold half at only £3OOO, and thus reckon its
profit at £5OOO. But as the boom has been main-
tained, the remnants have been sold, and the big
difference between the sale price and the severely
written-down book value has accounted for a good
deal of the extra-large profits of the last couple of
years.
As for the future, nobody knows. The borrowing
can’t last, so the boom won’t last. It would have
broken before now if the wheat harvest had failed,
as it once threatened to do. If we have a bad
season, followin' s ' hard upon the enforced stoppage
of borrowin' s- , we shall have a slump; and then
with few sales to make, the co.’s profits will look
very different. Yet interest will come in: even if
the co. makes only 5 p c. on its funds, it can earn
enough to pay about 7 p.c. Its strength lies in
the fact that its freeholds (including, no doubt, citv
premises) run to only £54,105; so the unsold lands
don’t represent much of the capital—and, no doubt,
a bit of profit will be picked up by an occasional
sale even when the property market' is sick. Alto-
gether, then, the co. has got itself into a very
strong position, assuming, of course, that in making
sales and advances, fair cash deposits and instal-
ments have been got in and a good margin thus
provided against a possible shrinkage in values.
The amazing profits of the boom years ago will not,
of course, be maintained; but the reserves are so
large that even if it made only bank interest it
could still pay a very fair dividend on the capital.

This co. has made an exceptionally good start; but
The Bulletin would like the look of things better
if there was more share capital in the business. Evi-
dently its success has been greater than it expected ;
certainly, it could hardly have foreseen the present
expansion of its trade when it started on a capital
of well under £15,000. Since then it has made
more than one appeal for money; but the most
success it had was through the issue of 12,000 £1
pref. shares. Of 18,000 £1 ordinary shares 15,354
have been issued, but 125 of these have been for-
feited. To raise a few pounds more it was lately
decided to send these unissued and forfeited shares to
market. This will bring the capital to £30,000,
assuming that they are all taken, as they ought to
be on the figures furnished above; yet that, after pay-
ing outstanding accounts, will still'leave the co. with
its overdraft of just over £15,000. The trouble is,
not that a woollen plant costs such a tremendous lot
of money, but that stocks-—raw, in process of manu-
facture and manufactured—run in this case to over
£19,000. No doubt the borrowed money is fairly
cheap—probably the co. is paying the bank a shade
less than it is now paying shareholders on their capi-
tal. But it isn’t safe. Given a crisis of any sort,
and the consequent disappearance of profit, the bank
won’t reduce, its interest: on the contrary, the worse
things are—in other words, the poorer the security—
the more interest it will want. But with share capi-
tal, a crisis, if it comes, can be tided over by the
suspension of dividends. It is therefore desirable,
if stocks must be kept so large, that more share
capital should be got in to replace some or all of
the present overdraft. And on the results so far, the
proposition is attractive enough to command the
money. If it isn’t, then the outlook for manufactur-
ing propositions in Australia must be regarded as
shockingly poor. Even allowing that most people
were able to get more for their wares last year than
they can rely upon as an average, a new co. must
be regarded as being on an exceptionally good wicket
when it can show £5637 of gross profit, while only
£1557 is needed to pay a 6 p.c. dividend.

This co.’s paid capital is £13,000, and shareholders
are liable for a further £37,000. That and the
£15,046 of reserves form a very respectable guaran-
tee that the estates handed over to the co. will be
treated with proper respect. And that idea seems
to be growing; for whereas six years ago estates
under control were £501,355, they are now
i 1,658,594. On the capital and reserves combined
earnings were at the rate of 12.8 p.c. p.a. for the
past six months, which shows how exceedingly p ro _
ntable the business can become. Of the £ll5O
dividend, £5OO represents a bonus of 6d a share
the directors’ way of saying that shareholders are
welcome to it while it is there, but the directors
won’t guarantee that it will always be there. How-
ever, unless something goes very wrong with the
investments, there shouldn’t be much less than the
present distribution coming regularly to the share
holders, seeing that interest earnings alone last half-
year were £1167, or rather more than the total divi-
dend and bonus.

sept., xux.s .. ( Written off, £5OO .. 10,591
Two or three years ago the co., wanting a home of
its own, bought premises which the Commercial Bank
of Tasmania had grown out of; and, like a good,
careful soul, it has started to pay off the mortgage
( £4000) out of profits. Hence the £5OO now shown
as written off. Ihe paid capital of the co. is only
£lO,OOO, so the reserves exceed the capital, which
means that the co. could pay a 10 p.c. div. by
investing its funds at 5 p.c. and going to sleep. As
a matter of fact, the interest earnings are just on
5 p.c., and even then, so far as one can see, the
society doesn’t charge itself with rent for the office
premises. To get this result the co. has, however, to
go into the mortgage business —it has £13,897 out
on that class of security. And a mortgage may be
almost gilt-edged or it may be bad; you can’t tell
which it is merely from the label. Apart from that
doubt, things look all right. The business doesn’t
promise to make any great or sudden strides, but it
ought to last, and it ought to grow steadily, if slowly ;
for the professional trustee, who puts up bonds to
be of good behavior, must as time goes on do a lot
of the work now done or left undone by the man
who treats it as a sideline and doesn’t put up any
bonds whatever.

With one single exception the profits are the lowest
in 10 years; and again, for the very manyth time,
things are cut too fine in paying the fat dividend.
Besides starving the reserves, such a dividend isn’t
calculated to attract business. In comparison with
the capital (£8500) liabilities are heavy—£37,9ol
for the past year, as against £34,043 in 1912.
Liquid assets consist of £33,922 of advances and
accounts owing, and £5689 of bills receivable.
Premises, yards, etc., are kept well written down
and by this time are probably below their
real value. Besides £2OOO of unissued capital there
is another £7500, representing 10s. a share, callable.
So, while creditors are thus more or less safeguarded,
shareholders have something to think about. There
wouldn’t be so much need to think about it if the
reserves were a bit more substantial —and that doesn’t
look as though it would happen while the present
dividend is paid.
The little National Advocate Newspaper
Co., of Bathurst (N.S.W.), was a long while giving
its shareholders a taste of dividends; but it is doing
all right now. On a paid capital of £2342 it made
in the past year a profit of £954, after writing-down
plant; and though that is equal to about 40 p.c. on
capital, the directors are wisely strengthening the
finances by paying only 5 p c. —the sixth div. in 25
years. More or less liquid assets are £1839 in excess
of the liabilities, which consist now of only a few
trade debts.

The co. has, during the year, paid 40 p.c. on its capi-
tal of £150,000, and made more than enough to pay
another 20 p.c. ; but as it is buying a sixth dredge,
and also wants to pay off £18,830 of debentures, it
is saving up some money. It doesn’t find the process
difficult. Tongkah has been an amazing proposition
altogether. When it was the IXL, the Tasmanian
jam people and Captain Teddy Miles issued figures
that looked fabulous; and they looked still more
fabulous a while later when the Baillieus’ representa-
tives turned it down. Certainly one could never say
for certain that Miles was wrong. All that one
could say was that the property hadn’t been bored
in a manner that would satisfy any painstaking
engineer. And, so far as The Bulletin knows, the
property (which consists of the bottom of a shallow
harbor in Siam) hasn’t been thoroughly bored to
this day. The dredged area is a very small part of
the entire area of 5350 acres ; but how many of the
5350 acres are payable nobody knows. This much is
sure: No. 4 dredge, which has been working out
farthest from the shore, has got the smallest average
during the past year; and, apparently, the farther
out it has worked the poorer the average. How-
ever, the poorest monthly yield gives a fine profit.
The smallest value got for a month by any dredge
last year was 5.51 d. per cub. yard, while average
costs were for dredging 3.81 d. and for etceteras
0.71 d. ; total, 4.52 d. Thus on the poorest ground
treated, taking the average for a month, the profit
was almost exactly Id. Certainly on that the co.
wouldn’t get fat; yet there would be nearly 10
p.c. on the capital.
That the yield is slackening off is plain. Here
are some figures:—

On the other hand, costs have been rather higher lately,
though still much less than they were in the early
days of the co. As to the values, it must be remem-
-bered that all the dredges are within a wedge-shaped
area. No. 4 dredge, which has the lowest average,

has been working out at the point of the wedge,
Yet, though it has been in the poorest ground, it is
only fair to say that in past years dredges working
much nearer in-shore have at times got poorer re-
sults. Back early in 1910, for instance, a monthly
average of only 2.02 d. was got by one machine. It
has been suggested that the tin lies only inside a
channel within the harbor; and probably this is
more or less correct, though it is clear that even
within the worked area—presumably the channel—
there are spots where the wash is under the pay
limit. How much of the whole is payable The
Bulletin hasn’t a notion. It seems highly improba-
ble, though, that the payable ground will give out
suddenly in any direction ; and there is a big margin
now between the actual results and the limit of pay-
ableness, wherefore it doesn’t look unreasonable to
assume that there is still a large area of payable
ground to work. As time goes on, the co., more-
over, will be relieved of one expense. The co. origin-
ally undertook to scoop out for the Siamese Govern-
ment a dock and channel, and that was a most
onerous condition. In November, 1910, a new arrange-
ment was made by which the Government agreed to
accept £35,000, payable £7OOO down and £7OOO
a year for four years. The have, of course,
been kept up, and only £10,500 remains t> be
handed over. Payments have thus far been charged
against profits. On the other hand, while this out-
going will presently cease, the co. will have amazing
luck if it goes on getting anything like the present
price for tin; and present price is less than £175
per ton, as against £229 at the beginning of this
eo.’s last year.

Great. Cobar closed up its Chesney mine
and plant quite unexpectedly at the end of last
week, two days after posting notices to the effect
that the Christmas holidays would commence on the
20th instant and end on January 5, so apparently
something unusual has happened. The last word
sent round is to the effect that the shut-up is
indefinite. The water is being kept below the 7ft. level.
Last month’s Great Cobar output of 555 tons copper,
with the usual gold and silver, is not going to make
the shareholders too jovial for Christmas. The
Chesney plant ran well last month; also the Great
Cobar’s smelters and Cobar Gold Mines got an
unusual hustle on; yet only 555 tons of copper were
turned out. It is reported that Bellinger has asked
his directors to relieve him of the management as
soon as possible, not later than next April. The
next manager may possibly help to pay the deben-
ture interest by reducing the present staff about 75
p.c. Bellinger can truthfully say that he has very
numerous and well-paid officers; but he has been
unfortunate in not getting better value for his
money. In particular there’s plenty of opportunity
for a really up-to-date underground manager used to
handling large tonnages. The underground work on
all or most of the properties is drifting into a de-
plorable condition, and apparently no one can grapple
with it. What with a falling copper market, a
reduced output, scarcity of water and the industrial
agreement expiring next April, things on the field
don’t look promising.
Queen Bee, Cobar (N.S.W.), struck bad
luck lately. After shifting the office to Sydney, the
leases for some reason or other were allowed to
lapse, and were pegged out by another party. The
old co. talks fight, so costs will probably get the
best of the deal in the long run.
Occidental (N.S.W.) still sends fairly
good stone to the battery; but looking at the past
reports it’s just as well to remember that a rich
vein has been held in reserve to sweeten things up,
and it’s possible this vein has been getting a little
overtime work lately. At any rate, it’s just as well
for the outsider to know it’s there. ■
“Mainshaft”: “Disheartened” hits the
bull’s eye (B. 4/12/’l3) in objecting to the dila-
tory methods of lodide management. Bulk sampling
week after week shows a continuance of very payable
assays at both levels, yet the management is content
to keep on picking the eyes out of the mine and to
suspend sinking a few feet below the No. 2 level.
There are surely pumps in Australia, and 100,000
gallons in 24 hours is only a joke. The mine has
been paid for, and there is money in hand. Surely
the time has arrived for rapid sinking, so as to put
the mine quickly into condition for local treatment
of ore and the saving of 355. or so per ton for
cartage to the railway.
Wilkinson and Co.’s low-grade show on the
Big Hill, Stawell (Vic.), which lately closed down
owing to most of the available ore being below the
pavable limit, coupled with lack of capital to open
out known bodies of better stuff, is. to be disposed of
to a locally-formed co. The operations furnish inter-
esting evidence as to what ore can be made to pay
under favorable conditions. From June, 1911, to
June, 1913, the co. raised 23,559 tons, and
crushed and cyanided it for a yield of £9254, or 7s.
10d. per ton ; the total costs amounted to 6s. 3d per
ton, leaving -a profit for the two years of £1865.
These results were obtained with a very ancient 10-
head mill, the treatment comprising crushing with
cyanide solution and separation of the sand and
slime, the former being treated by ordinary leacning
in sand vats, and the latter by a small slimes plant.
Power was supplied by 22-h p. and 12-h.p. suction
gas engines. It was proposed to float a co. of 20,000
ss. shares, but the Stawell public took the matter up
with such avidity that the scrip was over-applied
for, so it has been decided to increase the capital
to 30,000 shares. Considering that practically the
whole of the plant, with the exception of the en-
gines, consists of second-hand, makeshift appliances,
and that the proprietary worked under pretty well all
the disadvantages incidental to the pioneering of a
new industry, with more enthusiasm than capital,
there would seem reason in the remark of the most
experienced mining manager in Stawell, at a public
meeting called by the Mavor to discuss the formation
of the new co., that Wilkinson and Co. had done
wonders with their small plant, in proving Hi at such
ore could be made to show a profit of Is. id. a ton.
For a considerable period of the operations costs were
kept as low as ss. 6d. per ton.
The boomster in Ararat (Vic.) stocks had
better be careful. There isn’t a claim there that
has got to the third stage of all alluvial shows—
that of production from actual mining work. The
New Langi and the South Langi are the nearest to
it but the first-named hasn’t risen into the wash,
and the second is poking around high reef-washes.
As for the rags and tags of the field they are being
traded in regardless of the fact that a couple of
years’ calls are ahead of them. If it has cost the New
Langi £40,000 to get where it is, other shows on the
big gutter aren’t going to escape more lightly. Great
Langi is the special goods of the tipster, because it
has surface-bored the course of two leads. But here a
water problem may have to be tackled, and that
isn’t a cheap job anywhere. Stanley Hunter, of the
Mines Department, has been mixing things up, too,
by boring in the East Langi lease, directly next and
east of the New Langi. There he has picked up a
second gutter —as if the New Langi alongside is not
big enough in all conscience! Hunter reports rat-
tling good samples of gold from his drill cores.
Here, then, is another chance for an artistic director
to do some padding, like the one who has just
written of an Ararat show: “From the boring, the
prospects of this co. becoming one of the principal
gold producers of the State are very bright.” As
if surface bores were worth a penn’orth of tape!
Ajax Central, Daylesford (Vic.), will have
to take care. A drop of 2770 z. in a month brings
things down towards the danger-zone so far as the
life of the 2s. div. goes. The pace first set could
not last, but the reduction has been hastened by the
widening of the stopes due to the spurry nature of
the gold-bearing formations.
Another Victorian mine that is having a
choppy time is Central Cathcart, Ararat. It looks
as if it has been worked up to its full production ;
and any decline in the area of the estimated rich
ground would cause trouble.
Since the new co. got to work. Long
Tunnel, Walhalla, has crushed 5004 tons for 14690 z.
gold, worth £5131. The average, therefore, is a
shade under 6dwt. per ton, or with pyrites just
64dwt. This won’t cover working exes., for the gold is
valued at only £3 12s. 6d. per oz. All the same,
the man in charge is as full of pluck and fight as a
bull-ant. Others, no doubt, would have been the
same if they had been given £22,000 to play with.
What crippled things was the crumpling-up of the
strata and the reef from 3000 ft. to 3375 ft. Geolo-
gist Hetman’s idea is that 250 ft. of sinking will
bring more settled country. Even so, it doesn t
always follow (vide the South German) that gold
makes below a heavily-faulted region. However, the
new directors hold out the hope that the mine will
be self-supporting before long. If it isn’t, Walhalla
will feel very unwell. As an insurance against
failure in the deep ground, the shallow ground south
to the old Great South mine ought to be opened up—
by tributors, if by no one else.
Great Southern Consols, Rutherglen
(Vic.), struck trouble at the 13s. mark, proving
that while it is easy to buy, it is often the deuce
of a job to sell. Sydney is understood to have loaded
up with the stock, and scrip has been planted in a
score of little towns in each State by arduous enthu-
siasts who think the Consols is a mine. But it
hasn’t yet got the wash that will shove it high up on
the div. list.
Chaffers (W.A.) held a-statutory meeting
in London on October 24, when prospects were
further puffed by the chairman. According to his
unsworn statement, there is a good deal of gold in
sight; but before deciding on what size mill to in-
stall the management will see how much wealth the
mine really possesses. When this point is settled
the plant will be erected right away. Among other
things alleged to be visible underground are 52,000
tons of blocked-out 30s. ore, a drive estimated to
average 30s. to 31s. for 300 ft., and a crosscut that
“appears to indicate” that there is an additional
200 ft. of the same value. But so many estimates
have been made and falsified that in this instance
The Bulletin will accept no figures but those a
treatment plant supplies.
* * * *
Honorable mention is again made in official
reports of Sons of Gwalia (W.A.). Values in the
lower levels are said to be first-rate, while a similar
state of affairs is alleged to exist in the bottom
workings below No. 19 level. Costs are down to
175., and the starting next month of the new filtra-
tion process is expected to pare them down a bit
more.
* * * *
A sort of “day’s march nearer home” half-
yearly meeting was held by Golden Ridge (W.A.)
on the 26th ult. The chairman said as cheerfully
as circumstances warranted that a certain amount of
work had been done during the six months just
ended, and, although there was little hope of finding
anything, development would be continued wherever
prospects warranted it. With cost of development
taken off, profits for the half-year amounted to
£4680, or £7BO a month. Owing to the accumu-
lated residues being all treated and ore values not
being nearly as good as formerly, the monthly sur-
plus would now be reduced to £500; but in view
of the rapid depletion of reserves it was unlikely
that it would long be maintained at this figure.
No divs. had been paid during the period under re-
view, and cash assets now aggregated £17,361. If
the co. succeeded in obtaining another show, this
money would probably be required for purchase and
equipment; but if the co. was unsuccessful in its
efforts to find a mine, the amount would be dis-
tributed among shareholders. So far, the Board's
efforts to get another property have been unavailing.
A number of leases have been tested and turned
down; the Yerilla King, on which a bit of money
was spent, has just been added to this list.
Bullrush (W.A.) has a bank overdraft of
£13,337, and owes £2500 or thereabouts to sundry
creditors. In addition it has 31,705 Kyarra shares,
and a mine on which roughly £19,000 worth of
equipment has been installed and £9582 expended
in development. It proposes to liquidate most of
the overdraft by stirring up shareholders for the
£12,500 of uncalled capital, but this will not put
the co. on its financial legs unless the mill comes
to the rescue. Reserves are given as 41,000 tons,
averaging 365. per ton, and a little more develop-
ment is expected to add considerably to this ore.
The co. may pull through, but, on paper, the chances
of shareholders getting much beyond the proposed
distribution of depreciated Kyarra shares don’t look
brilliant. To put working costs down at so much a
ton, and then’cheerfully proclaim that the balance
of the 365. per ton estimated to be in sight will
be profit, is one thing, but to extract the gold and
get it into the bank without incurring additional
expense is another. “Sweet the rind, bitter the
core,” is a motto that ought to he wri f lu-g'T over
the face of many a well-intentioned but miscalcu-
lating Westralian venture, and it is more than likely
it will have to be chalked on the dial of the Bull-
rush Co.
Randells (W.A.) is still going for its life.
Innumerable bodies of ore which were formerly
declared by reputable persons to be unpayable are
now reported by the local press to contain high
values, and ounce assays are mentioned every other
day. Bv-and-bye, when most of these formations
fail to pass the mill test, the confiding persons who
were guileless enough to believe these statements will
want to know what has become of all the riches.
People are billing South Kalgurlis as a
tempting speculation. They probably don’t know
any better; but those who listen to them wilt
presently.
There is nothing wrong with Bullfinch
Prop. (W.A.). Leastways, managing-director D. L.
Doolette says so. He states that the stripping of
the northern lode series at the Nos. 2 and 2 levels
gives consistent 355. to 40s. values, and that the
capping of an apparently large sulphide body has
been struck in the southern lode series at the first-
named level. A drive west on this formation has
so far averaged 425. 6d. He ridicules the yarn
that the plant is incapable of treating sulphides, and
points with glee to the fact that when p.c. of
this class of rock was added to the oxidised stuff
put through the mill, a better extraction was
obtained, the average of the residues falling to 2s.
fid. per ton. According to Doolette, the sinking of a
new main shaft, if undertaken, need not worry
shareholders in the slightest, as this work would
only be put in hand with a view to cheapening
costs, and would quickly repay any expenditure
upon it.
“Beta”: The geological description of
Edna May, Weston’s (W.A.), as supplied by manager
Michael Williams, is that the lease lies in a contact
zone between dark schistose rocks that have pro-
bably been derived from greenstones of some kind
and a rock which is decidedly of an acid character.
This may be the “porphyritic rock” of A. E. Mor-
gans, or the “granite” that the bears talk about.
Anyway, it sends what the manager calls a series
of tongues east through the leases. There is a sheared
line along the margin of this rock, and here, accord-
ing to Williams, portions of the ore deposit “occur
in a series of quartz lenses more or less continuous.”
The intrusions of acid rock, he says, disturbed the
schists, and in the lenticular spaces so formed de-
posited a series of quartz veins. But there is a
story that one of the granite intrusions cut through
the ore body; and if it did that, it was of later
date than the lode. Still its action may have been
to enrich the ore-bearing formation at the point of
contact. Sinking is to be hustled on to give another
75ft. lift. Then Kalgoorlie will be able to see
who’s right as to the valuation of the mine. At
present it is wondering why Frank Were and Lang-
ridge were unceremoniously biffed off the Board to
make room for two sharebrokers—Tolhurst and
Bobbie Turner.
On top of all the booming reports that
Adelaide has been spreading about Holden’s Find
(W.A.) come the following remarks by the local in-
spector of mines: “There are a large number of reefs
to be seen, but there is not sufficient work done on
any of them to prove their width, much less their
value.” Which bears out what The Bulletin has
said —and been blackguarded for saying.
New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers,
went back during its last half-year to the extent of
£1933. Still, the credit balance in November was
£10,441, with £3246 due from the Burdekin mill
account. The Freehold is lucky in having its own
mill. Many a Towers co. has come to grief because
of the toll it had to pay to the crusher.
* * * *
New Queen Cross, Charters Towers, issues
a hopeful half-yearly report, and vaguely hints that
a dividend may be declared before long, though the
credit balance oh November 5 was only £2382. The
Papuan, next door, handled 208 tons for an average
of £8; and if the stone now being crushed for the
Cross returns a similar high value, there may be a
dividend. The return for 6 months was, however,
only £3475 from 725 tons, or £4 15s. lOd. per ton,
and the Cross can’t much more than pay exes, out of
that.
Mount Elliott shares are worth little more
than half their 1912 boom price; they soared then
to £B. The speculator, on tiptoe for movements, hasn’t
relished the recent long intervals between dividends.
To make things worse, Elliott’s lavish 10s. in February
was followed by a humble ss. in December, and the
fact that the aggregate dividends in 12 months to
June 30 exceeded the net profits doesn’t comfort
shareholders. Since June in this year the blister
copper output has been 2073 tons in five months.
Last month the fine copper contained in blister was
457 tons, with 7130 z. gold and 10670 z. silver, worth
(with the base metal at £6O) approximately
£30,378. This was from 4366 tons of ore. Re-
turns worth £7 per ton of ore smelted suggest
good profits. And they really have been something
to wonder at, for during the three years to June 30,
1913, the production was 15,285 tons and the aggre-
gate net profit £431,161, or an average of £2B per
ton of copper produced. The, 124,182 tons of ore
treated in three years returned over 12 p.c. copper,
aqd an average net profit of £3 9s. sd. per ton.
On this reckoning Elliott, at present prices, requires
to know of at least 150,000 tons of 10 p.c. ore to
feel comfortable —and it doesn’t know of anything
like so much.
Clermont (Q.) has a Wild Cat claim
wherein it is hunting the deep leads for gold. It
hadn’t struck much except water until the other day,
when it came upon the fossilised jawbone of a vast
animal, with several teeth in very good preservation.
It is the most interesting find to date, but is not ex-
pected to work out to much of a dividend.
Radium Hill can now standardise its
bromide, and has 40 milligrams ready, and a big
stock is being worked up in the laboratory. The re-
ports will from this out state the exact quantities
of bromide produced and for sale without further
treatment, instead of giving an estimate of the
radium contents. This candid announcement is im-
portant ; nevertheless there are only a few languid
offers for Radium Hill shares.
The Umeari Co., of Sydney, is building
a dredge to work a gold property in the Philippines
said to be a mile up a shallow river. The Philip-
pines are a block or two off The Bulletin’s regu-
lar beat; wherefore, having no information on the
point itself, it merely asks: (1) Is the river deep
enough to float a dredge, and, if so, how often is it
deep enough? (2) If it isn’t deep enough, how long
will it take the dredge to chew a passage for itself
a mile up from the mouth? (3) Has the co. an
official map of the locality, and does it know for
certain whether the concession is one mile or six
miles up-stream? (4) If it is more than one mile
and somebody else holds the dredging rights of the
intervening area, does it know whether it can get
authority to plough up that area in order to reach
its own stretch of country?
G. H. Ivnibbs illuminates the question of
the cost of living in Australia in his last quarterly
bulletin. Taking 20s. as the base, he compares the
purchasing power of money from July to September
last for commodities and housing accommodation in
30 different towns. No doubt because of its largely-
fictitious prosperity, following upon its excessive
borrowing, N. S. Wales is the most expensive State,
while Queensland is the cheapest. ’The former is 7
p.c. above the average, and the latter 11 p.c. below.
In Kalgoorlie (W.A.) more care is required with the
pennies than in any other of the listed towns, while
in Beaconsfield (Tas.) food and rent are cheaper
than in any other of the 30 towns quoted. Knibbs
figures that food which costs 11s. 2d. in Melbourne
would cost 12s. 4d. in Sydney, 17s. 9d. in Kalgoorlie,
11s. Id. in Ballarat, 14s. sd. in Broken Hill, 11s. 4d.
in Brisbane, 11s. 6d. in Rockhampton, 12s. 2d. in
Adelaide, 12s. 9d. in Port Pirie, 13s. Bd. in Perth
and Fremantle. 12s. lOd. in Hobart and 11s. lid. in
Launceston. Compared-with a payment of 9s. 6d.
For rent in Sydney, Bs. sd. is paid in Melbourne,
6s. 7d. in Brisbane, Bs. 6d. in Adelaide, 7s. Id. in
Perth and Fremantle, 6s. 9d. in Hobart, 6s. Id. in
Broken Hill, 6s. in Newcastle, 4s. lOd. in Ballarat,
ss. lOd. in Rockhampton, ss. lid. in Kalgoorlie and
6s. 4d. in Launceston. Food and housing which
would cost 20s. as an average for all the towns are
set down at 21s. lOd. in Sydney, 19s. 7d. in Mel-
bourne, 17s. lid. in Brisbane, 20s. Bd. in Adelaide,
20s. 9d. in Perth and Fremantle, 19s. 7d. in Hobart,
18s. 3d. in Newcastle, 20s. 6d. in Broken Hill, ios.
lid. in Ballarat, 17s. 4d. in Rockhampton, 235. Bd.
in Kalgoorlie, 235. sd. in Geraldton and 18s. 3d. m
Launceston. The increase in cost of living since
1911 has been greatest in Sydney (14.1 per cent.) ,
Melbourne follows (10.9 per cent.), then Hobart
(10.3 per cent., and Brisbane and Adelaide (5.0 pei
cent.). Going back some years, the Commonwealth
Statistician snows that, since 1904, in Sydney, the
total increase is 34.83 per cent., of which 16.96 pel
cent, is due to the higher cost of food and 17.87 per
cent, to increase in rent. Without committing him-
self, Ivnibbs says it is not at all unlikely that the
final figures for the whole of the current year will
show that the phenomenal increase of 1912 has been
converted into a decrease during 1913.

A WOMAN'S LETTER
Sydney, December 8, 1913.
My Dear Arini,—
Woman the voter sallied forth on
December 6 to lay her X before
the champion of her cause. At some
booths there were brisk arguments as
to whether certain people were disqualified
or not; and when the “Not on the rolls”
argument was used on small, mild women,
they looked as if they’d faint away with
shock. Bumptiousness on the part of some of
the officials, and a tendency to bounce the
meek who do not inherit the earth on these
occasions, led to a few sharp skirmishes. In
one Sydney suburb an ex-Minister and a
Petticoat who had been organising on the
other side came within the danger-zone that
is bounded on the far side by fisticuffs.
Finally, they ordered each other off the
premises and got out into the open before
any damage was done. As I write both par-
ties are claiming a more or less glorious
victory, though the only certain victory won
is by the party machines. The Independents,
whether they had a Liberal or a Labor com-
plexion, came to grief in nearly every in-
stance.
A.D.C. Talbot will depart hence some time
this month, deeply offended with things in
general in this humble “colonial” villaere.
He returns to duty in the 11th Hussars. The
magenta-legged uniform of that haughty regi-
ment is at present adored by the nursemaids
round about Aldershot.
Some wandering Australians caught sight
of the Chelmsfords’ elder daughter Joan
in Paris a month or two ago. The
fair-haired Miss Thesiger wasn’t worrying
about being called the Hon. Joan just then,
as she was steeped in the study of French
verbs.
G. H. Reid met the recent heat wave in
his panting tour to the Northern State.
After smoking a cigar or two with the
Macgregor in Brisbane, he leaves that vil-
lage on December 9, in the Bombala, for
Rockhampton. Son Douglas goes with the
burly traveller as a sort of private secre-
tary, while Mrs. Reid and daughter Thelma
still saunter through interminable tea-fights
in Sydney. On January 7 they go to the
vice-regal cot at Sutton Forest for a few
days; then they wander further afield to
Yanco, where they will browse in the
McCaughey sheepfolds. The whole caval-
cade steps on to the boat at Fremantle on
March 10 and gets back to London.
General-manager Russell French com-
pletes his half-century of service in the Bank
of N. S. Wales this month. It is a long
time to hang up your hat every morning on
a peg in the same office. The staff is going
to mark Mr. French’s score of 50, not out,
by handing him Gruner’s 100-guinea picture
of Sydnev ■’•bor. The little ceremony is
fixed for Thursday (11th).
George Lambert’s wonderful picture, “The
Holiday in Essex,” which was loaned to the
recent Society of Artists’ show, will now
resume its journey to its owner, Prof.
Meyer, in Melbourne. The Australian
artist expressed a wish that this sample of
his new old-masterish manner should be
exhibited here, on its way to the purchaser,
who paid five hundred guineas for
it. As it hung at one end of the just-closed
show, it dominated the exhibition, and gave
a National Gallery tone to the sacking-
covered walls. Prof. Meyer, who collects
gems of art as easily as the average person
collects dust in his eyes, hasn’t seen the
original. He acquired it by proxy, or on a
fine reproduction in an Academy annual.
The joy of anticipation in this case is likely
to be surpassed by the pleasure of posses-
sion.
Two things stuck out like haystacks in
the recent Society of Artists’ show. First,
the public desire to buy really reliable etch-
ings of Sydney’s old bricks and mortar
erected in the days when you could have
bought the G.P.O. site by the acre. Lionel
Lindsay’s etchings sold like fresh eggs at
Easter. Some of them sold so often that
they were spotted with a violent red rash
indicating the number of copies ordered —
sold-pox, I suppose. The next haystack was
the suggestion that the fan, as an instru-
ment of feminine warfare, is an almost ob-
solete weapon. Even fan-collectors in this
State must be extinct. Otherwise Thea
Proctor’s beautiful designs would have sold
by the square yard. As things are, they
were admired, but not bought.
The students’ show in the R.A. Society’s
rooms reveals some promising work. C.
Townshend won first prize for rapid sketch-
ing, and made successful attacks on other
competitions. R. S. Wakelin is a student
who is threatened with an intelligent notion
of poster work. A Life-Class scholarship
(whatever that may be worth) also went to
this R.A.S. endeavorer. A painting scholar-
ship, described as No. 7 (which may mean
seven months’ hard labor or seven sovs.)
goes to Miss Mac Nab for a well-posed head.
Hero Wilshire gets several good marks for
a spirited effort to paint the gorgeous wara-
tah. William Dampier’s attempt to steer
his ship on to our nor’west coast, as de-
picted by an imaginative student with a
fist-full of Chinese white, shows that the
navigator hoped to get into serious opera as
The Flying Englishman. Still the Dampier
picture is not such an attack on fact as are
some of the efforts to sketch the nude. Two
or three students have given the female form
so many strange lumps and bumps that they
have evolved a new species that ought to be
useful to the race—a mixture of working
camel and Jersey cow.
The Benevolent Society of N. S. Wales is
the oldest beggar in the State. It has
been collecting subscriptions for 100 years.
Quite unabashed at this record, the veteran
mendicant is still asking for more. Amongst
its later-day developments are the Renwick
Hospital for Babes —where 1600 sick infants
are annually encouraged to double up their
fists and fight for life —and the Hospital
for Women at Paddington. Like all pro-
fessional beggars, the society makes its
special appeal in December, when its Out-
door Relief and Stores Department has a
queue of pensioners waiting for help.
Alderman James Sandy (Thomas-street,
Sydney) will welcome your mite, and melt
it down into plum pudding or prime mutton
for the queue.
Young George Armstrong and his second
wife, who used to be Evie Doyle, of Sydney,
are here on a visit. She is staying with her
mother for a week or two out Glebe way.
Mrs. George is a pretty, amiable young
woman who went abroad to study singing
under the late Marchesi. and gave up the
vocal art to marry Melba’s son. The fact
that he is Melba’s son is probably George
Armstrong’s greatest handicap. The off-
spring of a famous and abnormally brainy
mother is more or less buried under his
maternal parent’s shadow. The present
matrimonial arrangement is said to run on
velvet, and the Armstrongs may settle
happily enough on the soil which Melba
bought in the Lilydale (Vic.) district. The
farm is about two miles from Melba’s
palatial nest, Coombe Cottage.
The sudden death of Mr. W. T. Waters,
who founded the big drapery business that
bears his name, wipes out a commercial man
who was very popular in his lifetime —which
is more comforting than to be nicely
talked about on a tombstone. The end was
so unexpected that a few days before his
death Mr. Waters told a Sydney friend that
he was contemplating a trip to Europe in
1914. He thought of floating the business into
a public company later on, and retiring from
the din of the softgoods battle. The Time-
keeper with the Hourglass had already made
final arrangements, however.
George Fishburn, who recently passed
out at the age of 81, was one of the pioneer
railway-contractors in N.S.W. and Victoria.
His wife, who died about a year ago, be-
longed to the early-Australian type of
woman. She followed her husband into the
then wilds, and lived in a tent or a humpy
or any old place that happened to be handy
to the railway line her husband’s firm was
hammering together. George Fishburn
claimed that much of his early success was
due to the influence of the courageous woman
who was always at his elbow when little
blue devils threatened to dishearten him.
Until her death he was a cheerful youngster
o f 80 summers, who used to drive a pair of
spanking horses into business. When the
blow fell he suddenly grew into a very old
man.
Percy Hunter will leave for Naples, en
route for the Fog, this side of 1914, d.v.,
and politics permitting. He proposes to
bustle off the mailboat at Naples and
scour Northern Italy for farmers for
Victoria and N.S.W. Piedmont bristles
with skilled irrigationists of the small tenant-
farmer species, who may be lured by the
blithe, persuasive Mr. Hunter to come this
way. Ready-to-wear irrigation farms of 50
acres are the bait.
Dr. Lloyd, who died rather suddenly a
while ago, had been the favored healer of
Hunter’s Hill for so many years that two-
tliirds of the younger generation had cut its
first teeth or come through its worst measles
under his care. It is the practice he left
behind which Dr. Norman Robertson, a
descendant of “Old Jack,” recently bought
for about £3500.
The slow and tortuous progress of the
law in settling up the details of a will usu-
ally leaves the legatees in a state of affluent
penury for many months. The late Mr.
Martin Macadam, who inherited about
£130.000 from his uncle Theodore, died in
Maoriland last February. Up till a week
or so ago, and probably at the present time,
his widow has been buying her daily bread
and other necessaries of life with" money
borrowed at 6 per cent, or thereabouts. The
fortune tied up in parchment and pink
tape includes a castle in Wales. How much
a baronial hall, buried amongst Welsh hills,
eats in paint and unkeep onlv the owners
of these mediaeval villas are likely to know.
Until Brvntysilio is sold —if any stout-
hearted American bidder ever adds a castle
in Wales to his collection of old curios—the
family ghost and other faithful retainers
have to be kept in the comforts to which
they have been accustomed.
Clever Eirene Mort, a most original de-
signer in applied art, and her partner, Nora
Weston, are again located in their studio in
Llunter-street. They have buttoned on their
overalls and settled down to Work after 18
months’ scamper abroad. Leather, which is
one of the essentials of their craft, has basely
climbed up to exactly double the price it was
when they went off on their travels. After
recovering from this blow, the partners con-
soled themselves with an exhibition of their
wares last week. Good sales are reported
from the cosy den where Eirene designs and
Nora smacks the copper and punches the
leather until they burst out protestingly into
desert peas, native bears and other products
of the soil. Miss Mort has some etchings to
serve as vivid reminders of her recent travels.
Pianist Carlton Fay will have played at
the Donald Mcßeath concert before this
reaches you. He is a Sydney musician who
has been studying, teaching and giving con-
certs in Leipsic and the Rhine country for
the last four years. Fay is bubbling over
with enthusiasm about the size and weight
of the music you can buy for twopence in
Leipsic beer gardens. A symphony orchestra,
washed down with lager, is a daily joy in that
music-laden atmosphere, and a good
twopenn’orth. He studied under the head of
Leipsic Conservatorium, Professor Pembauer,
and got more tuition than his fees entitled
him to by staying for a long summer holi-
day at Innsbruck as the professor’s guest.
There Pembauer, at his practice, was a daily
education to the listening Australian.
Fiddler Donald Mcßeath. who goes through
the United States with John McCormack
(they reach Vancouver about February 3), is
going to settle down to study in Brussels
after the American tour. He will sit at the
feet of Csesar Thomson in that city—the
fiddler who deals out octaves to gaping
crowds —for three or four years. The Syd-
ney boy has made a joyous start on what
promises to be a fine career, though too much
limited-express hasn’t improved his technique
of late. He vows he’ll crawl into some quiet
place on the mailboat and fiddle till the
mice hold an indignation meeting.
Puccini’s music in “La Tosca” dragged
the public back to its old lair in Her
Majesty’s Theatre on Saturday night.
Jeanne Brola, in the name part, had to
suffer the inevitable comparison with the
beauteous Wayda, who warbled the music
here in 1911, with McCormack as Mario
Cavaradossi. John was in the manager’s
box the other night and became so absorbed
in the torture scene that he sang softly to
himself while the plump d’Oisly staggered
out of the grip of the rack. The stalls and
d.c. were well filled, and the gallery was
also comfortably packed. Dr. and Mrs.
Lipscomb and various members of the
family were spread over the mid-stalls.
Architect Theo Marks and Mrs. Theo were
in the same neighborhood. A phalanx of
musical Hollanders, little Mrs. J. J. Cohen,
the Garvans (Mamma and one daughter, not
long back from Europe) crowded into the
show. Miss Garvan’s coiffure was regarded
with respectful awe as something just out
from Paris. It was a round mass of black
hair swathed in black tulle. Some of the
tulle came down over one eye, burying it;
and a small raven tuft stuck out over one
ear. Paris may like it; as for us, this kind
of coiffure is an acquired taste and we have
not had enough of it to find it agreeable.
The most nimble members of the Quinlan
Opera Co. played Paling’s best cricket-team
the other afternoon. Neither side heaped
up centuries, and Victor Trumper has no
reason to tremble for his laurels. Paling’s
athletes managed to make six runS more
thdn Quinlan’s aviary, and thus won.
Shrimplin, the aesthetic, sad-eyed young
man who accompanied Dolores at the piano
in her last Australian tour, is now located
in ’Frisco. He writes to a male friend in
this city a stirring tale of socks. White
silk socks with black shoes are the latest
craze for the manly hoof over there. On all
occasions, I understand, the dandy thus
socked may demand a place in the forefront
of fashion.
The long-haired community is thinking out
a wedding present for pianist Hilda Thorn-
dyke, of this town. The name of the groom-
expectant may leak out any minute.
Mrs. Kennedy, who used to teach music
here, is coming back with her husband and
three sons. They have been touring the
world for five years as a concert co., and
have made more than a buttered crust at the
business.
John Lemmone, organiser of the H. N,
Southwell testimonial fund, records over
£3OO in hand. No subscription lists have
yet been called in, so a fat cheque should
eventually flutter over the border to
“Southie.” The sick man is still taking his
physic in Melbourne. Hon. treasurers are
the Mayor of Sydney and J. H. Merriman.
The Town Hall finds them both.
Dr. Barrington, of Macquarie-street and
a friend named Stowell, are going to motor
up to Kosciusko this week. They’re
mighty fishermen, and mean to whip the
reaches of the Upper Snowy. A camp will
probably shelter them part of the time.
On December IS local debating clubs are
going to air a little of their oratory in the
presence of G. 11. Keid. The Town Ilall is
to be the scene of this rally, with Chief
Justice Cullen in the chair. The name of
the referee is not mentioned.
The curious habit of mentioning the
engagement of ordinary, useful citizens as if
they were European royalties has attacked
even the far-away Ceylon Times. This
paper respectfully remarks that “a marriage
has been arranged” (this sounds as if the
Kaiser had a hand in the matter) “between
Mr. Anthony Brown, of Delwita Group
Kurunegala, and Miss Edith Holdship.”
She is a daughter of the late T. H. Ilold-
ship, of Sydney, who was something prom-
inent in the timber trade.
Muriel Starr is so keen about the Reper-
tory movement in this city that, with the
J.C.W. firm’s consent, she offered to give her
services in the coming production of Pinero’s
“Mid-Channel.” The piece will be staged in
the Criterion at one matinee only— next
Monday afternoon. Muriel of the velvet
voice will have the support of Grace Pal-
otta, Gwen Burroughs, Agnes Keough,
Nancy Musgrove and others.
Mary Makinson has carved to order a pre-
sentation box in black beanwood. This is
to be handed over to the newly-arrived Rev.
Mother-General of the Order which instructs
the young idea at Rose Bay Convent. Mrs.
O’Gorman Hughes is organising the little wel-
come to the newcomer from overseas, and
December 15 is mentioned as the date of the
party. A small consignment of lace (an
earthly weakness which nuns are said to
share with other daughters of Eve) will be
buried in tissue paper in the gift-box.
Mrs. Hope, one of Victoria’s pet plat-
form orators in the more or less Liberal
cause, went back to the Cabbage Patch last
week. She has been sampling the early-
summer climate at Bourke, where her son
has a sheep-run.
Even scholastic circles have been so
stirred by the recent arrival of the Lucas
Teeth (it’s impossible to call them Tooths)
that the council of the Teachers’ Guild and
other learned bodies fell # upon their necks
in the Fisher Library the other afternoon.
Prof. Mackie was the pedagogues’ mouth-
piece, with Education Board half a length
behind.
The N.S.W. Institute of Architects is
going to hold its fifth Biennial Exhibition on
December 12. The exhibits will be fortified
with light refreshments.
Colored labor isn’t all the bliss it is some-
times cracked up to be. The Papuan planter
has to reckon with original sin, or a steady
desire not to do any work, on the part of
his boys—which proves that labor is an
acauired vice. Mr. Scott, the rather weary-
looking sun-tanned Englishman who had
some exciting adventures in Papua not long
ago, records the uncertain joy of hiring help
in that quarter. After chasing your labor
per boot for 200 miles or so, you
beguile your boys in the raw or head-hunt-
ing stage with “trade” —some bead baubles
or blue calico or other gauds. Then you
bring your treasures back to civilisation,
sign them on for a year (if they don’t
change their minds or eat the contract), and
find them fairly useful after three or four
months’ training. At the end of the year
they’re liable to get back to their old busi-
ness of doing nothing, and the game begins
all over again. After taking stock of local
conditions, the much-travelled Scott, who is
passing through this town for some other
end of the earth, gave up the idea of rubber-
planting in Papua before he had started it.
There is some notion here of sending an
organiser through the length and breadth of
the State to round up housewives who will
trust the N.S.W. Government with £8
apiece. I think the Government has a hand
in this matter of pre-paid passages for
domestics, though the Billion Club is its
godma. Roughly speaking, about 50 would-
be women employers have already agreed to
part with the cash deposit in the desperate
hope of snaring domestic help in Britain.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.
More tombstones :- —
Among other tombs in the enclosure at St. David's,
Hobart, is that of the long-suffering Margaret Davev,
wife of “Mad Tom,” Tasmania’s second Governor.
He was released from a debtor’s prison in order
that he might take over his command, and did not
acquaint his wife with his change of fortune. She,
getting word of it a day or two before the boat
sailed, hurried on board, all unprepared, but in pos-
session of a bonnet which, for some reason or
another, so enraged her husband that he snatched
it from her head on the day of landing and flung it
overboard. After which, ignoring his waiting escort,
he stumped off in his wrath and his shirt-sleeves to
quench an always excessive thirst at the nearest pub.
“Tom’s” term of office came to an abrupt end —cut
off prematurely by his methods of government, which
included wild carouses in huts with a keg of rum
and a chorus of favored convicts. When he quitted
Tasmania his wife was left behind, and, surviving
her erratic partner, died in 1827.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 8, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Fuller dame has got straight back to
work. That is to say, she is doing minor
“opening” jobs. Margot Mackinnon con-
cocted a pocket open-air fbte at the John
Simsons’ Toorak house on Saturday last in
aid of the Children’s Hospital. A silver
coin took you in, and the painted Society
flapper did the rest. Her Ex., with a blue
feather in her hat and a collection of baby
Fullers watching her, went through the
usual incantations, and the gyrations started
forthwith. Almost anyone might have done
it.
The Fullers had quite the pick of the
vice-regal shelters during the last hot spell.
Mother and the children, with Help Kirk-
patrick and the devoted Victor Hood, were
all cool and collected at the Macedon cot-
tage. while Melbourne was doing its best
with iced drinks.
The Denmans have reserved their front
seats for the Repertory Theatre show on
Saturday, 13th. The double bill consists of
Bernard Shaw’s “Candida” and a one-act
thing by Schnitzler called “The Mate.”
The Fuller lady plaintively declares that
she never heard of Auntie Phipps’s sup-
posed engagement to big Geoff Kiddle until
the news was hurled at her in the drawing-
room of State Government House along
with some congratulations.
The Forrest dame, with her happy family
of nephews and nieces, has departed this
city, now that there is a slump in frivols
and an approaching vacuum in Federal
politics. She is travelling westward a fort-
night ahead of Bigjohn to open the win-
dows of the Perth house and get the trades-
people going.
The Alliance Frangaise had the party of
its year on December 3, when John Madden,
in his Lieutenant-Governor costume, pre-
sented the prizes in his usual sugary style.
A couple of Helps, one of whom was son
Guy, were accessories. The Madden dame,
being absent at Macedon, was able to estab-
lish an alibi. Mrs. Hennessy, who is presi-
dent, talked French in jet, and Mrs. Dyer
talked more French in clothes which I have
forgotten; but it was the same French —you
couldn't tell it from the Hennessy French.
They say, too, it sounds the same in plain
duds or even in the bathroom. Mr. Dyer
talked French in Scotch, but that didn’t im-
prove it. It is a language that sounds best
when taken straight. The prize-winning
children spoke straight French, accompany-
ing it with the proper gestures; they (the
gestures) help you to get it out of your
system, otherwise it is liable to soak in, and,
first thing you know you have to undergo an
operation. One of the Very Best Infants
wore diamond earrings for her platform
stunt, and I would have smacked her well for
it if I could have got near enough. Eileen
Starr, a long-legged child of 13, with big
eyes and a careworn face, carried off the
first prize ; if only humans were able to talk
with their limbs like the locusts, Eileen
would be able to clear the whole board. Lovie
Munller-Cadorin murmured in French to her
sculptor husband, and he murmured back.
This isn’t what you would call an exciting
item, but I just want to show you that
everybody was doing it. Secretary
Pigeonneau, who is so French that he is
above suspicion of not knowing his own lan-
guage, bragged in English about the Aus-
tralian slang he knew. Agnes Caples sat
at the piano with dimples in her elbows and
a frock with a lilac sash. It was a great
evening, but I would rather go to a Red
Indian ghost-dance.
Harold Grimwade, chemist in the city
and colonel on the field of war, is back again
from England, and, of course, is full of
British military doings. He flew over
Aldershot camp in the usual aeroplane, and
saw the Royal Horse Artillery at work. He
says it is “splendid,” and it would warm
the guns of the R.H.A. if they could only
hear him. Grimwade is such an enthusiast
with the guns that he has given up polo in
order to serve them better ; and he was pretty
good at polo, too.
Mrs. J. C. Williamson is coming to Aus-
tralia in January—but only for a visit, so
you needn’t cheer yourself hoarse, my dear.
She has taken a house at Hampstead, and
will reside there while daughter Marjorie
and the young lady who is known as
“Tootles” are “finished” —that is to say,
while the last remnants of their education
are rubbed into their hair. After that pro-
cess has been completed the young feminine
mind is regarded as full. Marjorie used to
have great hankerings after the stage, but
J.C. never encouraged the hanker. When
she hankered she hankered alone.
Dick O’Hara, son of surgeon O’Hara, has
come down from Bananaland with his wife
and a new pink infant. They are off to
England as soon as the numerous O’Hara
and Fisken aunts have cooed over the little
exhibit and loaded it with appropriate silver-
ware.
G. H. Knox and his wife are making
themselves responsible for the elaborate fuss
of a fashionable wedding. Relative Allie
Barton and Arthur Ballingall Harper are to
be the principals in the performance, which
will be held in the Scotch Kirk, Toorak.
The Knoxes live amongst the drags at Upper
Beaconsfield, in a place where motors do not
care to go, so the champagne breakfast-
spread will happen at Illawarra, Toorak.
Bess Norris-Tait has painted an ethereal
portrait of Mrs. Henry Cornish. The pretty
original murmurs in a satisfied tone that
she’s glad it’s so lovely, but protests that it
is flattered. She adds also that she is tired
of hearing about the portrait of sister Rose
that_ Queen Mary bought. I guess the public
is tired of it too. Some items of news
merely get stale —others become dashed
nuisances.
Mrs. Andrew Loughnan and squatter
Philip Russell’s wife are the latest appen-
dicitis patients. Both are in private hospi-
tals and recovering gracefully.
The W. J. T. Clarke dame, with daughter
Roma and the two youngsters, has hurried
down from the South Australian sheep
depot to perform the deck-chair pilgrimage
to London. Daughters Vanda and Nesta
will spend Christmas on the station; but,
later on, Dad will take the poor things to
London, by way of the United States.
I think you need to have petrol fumes in
your brain to properly appreciate a hill
climb. The Automobile Club held one on
Saturday, and I went, just to see what it
was like. About 500 motors dusted out
from Melbourne and collected like a lot
of ambitious ants at the foot of the remotely-
situated Wildwood Hill, which is a terrible
crag or hump with a length of road crawling
over it. Teamsters going to Lancefield and
Macedon drive miles out of their way to
avoid the obstacle, and horses who have seen
it have had dreams about it ever afterwards.
But the perverse motorist thinks it’s fine.
The only people on the scene besides the
car-owners and their friends were a few
curious horsemen who wanted to see the
new sport or madness. The tests lasted,
with a short luncheon interval, from 10 in
the morning till 4.30. There was a ladies’
contest, for which there were 30 entries.
Miss Mclntosh, who rushed up the steep
like a fury and nearly came a cropper
at > the turn, won, beating Nancy
Grice, who looked like a winner until her
car went back on her 10 seconds from the
top. The women present mostly wore tub
dresses and did not worry about grass seeds.
A Clarke maiden showed many inches of
tan silk stocking and tried to run
down a stump. Mrs. Coxon kept her glasses
steadily on her husband’s car while it
whirred up the wall. Mrs. Leibner, in
purple and a languid air, seemed to be tre-
mendously uninterested in the laborious en-
tertainment. One man ran over a dog
and was given another chance. I don’t
know whether he was presented with the
ruins of the dog as well. Geoffrey Syme
won the fastest-time competition with his
small car. President Weigall and Secretary
'’henoweth spent a busy time, and the re-
sults were nailed to the topmost tree on the
hill.
Mrs. Wilkinson, back from foreign places,
allowed daughter Ailsa to drive her own
car, with fiance Moore as passenger. Col-
lins, owner of several motors, snapshotted
all day. Tewksbury, of the Oriental,
brought a huge car containing, besides him-
self, his wife and a pretty daughter. Young
Milburn, son of the shipping Milburns, was
busy all the _ time with his camera. Hugh
V. McKay, in spite of recent spills, com-
peted, but was unsuccessful. The Auto-
mobile Club Magazine, which had been
born only that morning in a printer’s, was
passed round and discussed, but I found
nothing interesting in it. I suppose this
literature becomes understandable after
you’ve learnt the language.
Parsons, curates and all manner of things
under absurd black hats rushed to and fro
on Saturday at St. Peter’s, Eastern Hill,
where a fete was raging for the benefit of the
school and clergy. St. Peter’s is the city
depdt for the High brand of Anglican re-
ligion, and the people who reckon they have
double-width souls take them there to be
saved. Canon Hughes, the big good-looker
with the rich wife, wears the most elaborate
fancy-dress he can get; the organist, a doctor
of music, has a colored hood ; the verger is
suspected of tights and spangles. Of
course the f§te was infested by the rich, as
well as overrun by excited parsons. It
blithered along from three in the afternoon
till ten o’clock at night, and in that time
several tubs of money were squeezed out.
The Millers sent numerous donations, and
the Wrixon dame helped with her own
hands and feet. The Hughes pair sold holy
vegetables grown in their reverend garden at
Aspendale, and Mrs. Martin sold flowers
gathered in the religious gardens of Toorak.
Mrs. Etheradge and sister Mrs. E. A.
Connelly practically managed the whole
show. They had a sweets stall and 10 smart
pink-and-white girl helpers. The batch in-
cluded Miss Duke, the Ireland sisters, the
Gollins and the Pratts. This stall alone
cleared £5O, and later on its good, kind chief
bandits carried off their friends to a sup-
per at the Savoy. The par-
sons and parsonettes stayed behind and
revelled terribly with tea and boiled lollies
dredged out of paper bags.
Clara Butt and her Kennerley farewelled,
oh ! so sweetly, at the Auditorium on Satur-
day night. The usual half-gallon of dia-
monds sparkled above Clara’s blue gown.
The blue was the blue of an Australian sky,
and there were black spiders weirdly woven
into the fabric of the skirt. No color is
so effective with heavily-coiled black hair
such as Clara supports. The Maddens were
enthroned on the balcony ; artist Power and
his wife sat at the star’s feet; and the
Arthur Baillieus were somewhere adjacent.
Next day (Sunday) Mrs. Baillieu enter-
tained the whole company at her Toorak
house. Thirty women were invited to meet
them; the husbands were awarded exemp-
tion certificates for golf or sleep. I don’t
know who was responsible for the conces-
sion, but it was a wise one.
The serious-minded Emily Dyason had a
couple of hours with a piano at Melbourne
Auditorium one evening last week. The
young lady, who is a charming tribute to
the expertness of Leschetizky’s training, gave
due expression to her feelings for Chopin,
Liszt and other Illustrious Musical Dust.
She also played some of the compositions of
Ludwig Schwab, who was her colleague in
Kubelik’s company on tour in Europe a
while ago. Culchaw sat in approving rows
at the recital, and the applause was so rev-
erent that it seemed to be part of an ora-
torio.
The members of the Repertory Theatre
Club are to discuss that distant dance of
theirs, under the eye of the Denman lady,
on December 15. There is a long printed
list of things to be debated or babbled over.
Mrs. Hennessy, as president of the Alli-
ance Frangaise in Victoria, is giving a party
at the Town Hall on December 17, when
the acquired culture of the English-French
scholars will be displayed for the Denman
dame. Her Ex. is now in training for the
ordeal.
Vasco Louriero has returned to Melbourne
with a good stock of stories, after seven
years spent in wandering round the world.
He made his touring expenses by drawing
portraits at a shilling a time. The paying
properties of the scheme were discovered
on one of the bay excursion steamers, when
he made five guineas by drawing 150 shil-
ling portraits. (Now don’t tell me that 150
shillings make more than £5 ss„ and there
must be a mistake somewhere. I suppose
my arithmetic has broken down again. Any-
how, he made quite a lot of money.) All
portraits were drawn in profile (most people
don’t know their own profile), and most of
the sitters were shown laughing. If the
flower in the buttonhole or the locket on
the chain was right, the portrait was passed
gleefully as “good.” After the bay dis-
covery, he tried the inter-State boats, but
raised his charge there to ss.
The Robert Harpers’ Toorak mansion has
grown too large for them, the family having
dwindled away through matrimony. Willie,
the only bachelor survivor, is at present
away on a foreign tour. A new owner is
required for the big place, which will pro-
bably be robbed of its park land and the
cow that grazes thereon. Then the red-tiled
villa will arise, and the young married
couple will arrive with the infant that howls
like a wolf in the night.
The pale and well-groomed Olive Morell-
Kelly took a turn through Melbourne, prior
to making off towards England with small
daughter Mary.
Hugh V. McKay seems to be unlucky
with motor-cars. Some time ago one ex-
ploded in his face and tried to blind him.
Last week he and brother Sam were fleeing
towards N. S. Wales when their wheeled
beast overturned and pinned him under-
neath. A few bruises were, however, the
only personal injuries.
One of Society’s dames caused a flutter
at a smart At Home. When the lady was
announced every eye was turned to see what
sort of a gown she was wearing. But the
gown was forgotten and so was the dainty
tulle hat; it was the veil that caught the
attention. Only a bright pair of eyes looked
out from a thin piece of net; the rest of
the face was concealed beneath black silk.
So now, perhaps, other pretty faces will be
hidden, and we may see Melbourne the land
of veiled women because one of Society’s
favorites chooses to hide her frontispiece
under an “Eastern” veil and dye her nails
with henna. Nothing stops fashion when
she wants to create a sensation.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The return of the Bishop Thomases to the bosom
of their diocese was celebrated by a heat wave of
withering' energy and a public “welcome” at the
Exhibition Building on Monday night. Light re-
freshments and heavy speeches were impartially
handed out in the presence of a crowd composed
chiefly of clerics, wardens, lay-readers, Synodsmen
and such-like sainted characters.
The Literary Theatre gave its last dose of intel-
lectuality for the current year at the Unley Town
Hall on Saturday. Amongst those who were to be
observed absorbing Culture good and hard were
Miss Hornabrook and her sister, the Russell Booths,
Miss Brooks and Miss Ward, Miss Hack, Miss Gordon,
Mrs. Arthur Rymill, Mrs. George Box and Mrs
Moncrieff.
The J. H. Gordons have left —-not for London, but
for that other centre of wild, luxurious gaiety
Kangaroo Island.
Mrs. Ted Belt gave a garden party at the Almonds,
Walkerville, on Wednesday afternoon. In the inven-
tory of her garments were included a golden brown
and black coat and skirt and a Leghorn hat with
black tulle and a rose or two. The chief diversion
(eating, of course, excepted) was croquet. This
was for the young and gay and furiously energetic.
The other guests just sat about under the trees and
panted. The Downer lady wore white crgpe de Chine,
surmounted by a black hat, and Mrs. Lavington
Bonython was in a gracefully-built affair of black
and pmk ninon. Also, there were Miss Levi and her
sister, Miss Horn, Mrs. Stephen Ralli, Mrs. Jervois,
Mrs. W B Wilkinson, Mrs. Angas Parsons, Miss
Stow, Mrs. Fred Ralph, Mrs. Sydney Ayers and Mrs.
Rupell.
Mrs. Glen Legoe was to blame for another of these
revels the next day, Mrs. George Dean and Mrs. R. D
Ryder being the guests of honor.

“C.C.” : The scarcity of horseflesh, and the
extravagant prices asked for any animals suitable for
farm work, appears to have exercised the ingenuity
of at least one enterprising man in finding a cheap
substitute. So I see this advt. in my favorite agri-
cultural paper: —•

My neighbor Hayseed promptly applied for a pair
broken into the plough, and an extra heavy team
for a reaper and binder. Not getting any reply,
Hayseed said they were probably useless animals,
onlv fit to run the cows up and draw a light sulky.
“Lakekamu”: Reading a par. by “Tekelo”
(B. 18/9/’l3) re an epidemic of dysentery on a
plantation in Papua brings to my eyes the one that
raged on Lakekamu shortly after that goldfield opened
in 1910. It was just after Christmas Day that the
first case was observed; a boy had contracted the
disease on the coast, and was stricken on the launch
coming up the river. He was promptly isolated, but
to no effect, for in a few days there were cases in
nearly every camp on the field. A medical man was
available, and the Resident Magistrate, with the
assistance of the diggers, soon had a camp hospital
built on the side of a tree-covered hill, and a good
supply of drugs was on hand as well. Yet the out-
break proved almost as deadly as Asiatic cholera,
scores upon scores of the unfortunate victims passing
out on the third or fourth day. Soon the number
of sick became too much for the native hospital
attendants, who also helped to swell the number of
cases, and the doctor had almost to fight it out or
his own. To make matters worse, beri-beri. com
menced to spread, and things looked very serious.
The death rate was appalling—over 300 deaths
among about 1000 cases. One of the bravest
things done in Papua (and there have been a few)
was the volunteering of two of the Anglican Mission
nurses to take over the charge of the hospital. Nurses
Combley and Nowland —the former a quiet, brave
little Englishwoman ; the latter one of a well-known
Queensland family—went up to the- field, making a
journey of 200 miles by launch and foot, the first
white women ever to go so far inland in Papua, lhey
did wonderful work ; still the epidemic went along
wiping out the natives like flies. • However, every-
thing must have an end, and the end of this awful
period came, leaving two weary but triumphant
women and a haggard-looking doctor to count the
casualties. One of the nurses contracted beri-beri,
and her comrade had a very anxious time with her,
but she rallied, and was able to leave the field satis-
fied that she had done her duty. Her health had gone,
though, and a very few months saw this brave, gener-
ous and loving woman, Miss Ellen Combley, go to
fill a grave at Bartle Bay, the head station of the
Anglican Mission. The Lakekamu epidemic had very
different conditions from those which “Tekelo” de-
scribes, for during the whole period there was hardly
a day on which rain did not fall. In the first 10
months the rainfall registered some 217 inches, and
it was in this clamp and miserable climate that the
patients had to fight for life. The odds were all
against them ; for the only food available was im-
ported from the coast —rice, peas, etc. and if a
patient could not eat these things, he had to try
to keep alive on Bovril, cornflour, or, as a last
resource, wine. To natives accustomed to a regular
diet of vegetables fresh from the garden, these foods
were almost repulsive. And, of course, the
ignorance and superstition of the patients helped on
the work of the Reaper. Many of the sick would
not take the medicine ; others, again, would not keep
in their houses, but when the fever was at its
worst would dash down and wash themselves
in the icy cold creek. Some few patients went mad
and bolted into the bush, and perished there, for
they could not all be successfully tracked through
the soaking jungle. Burying the dead was the
most arduous part of the daily routine work of the
constabulary and prisoners, and soon the hillside in
front of the Residency was covered with graves. Five
or six white miners went under to the disease, but,
with these exceptions, the Europeans fared very
well. A side-issue was the desertion of numerous
native laborers, who, in fear of death, took the
chance of being killed and eaten by the prowling
Kuku Kuku sooner than remain near the disease.
“Ahaswer”: I’ve been investigating the
origin of the nicknames bestowed by my pupils on
each other. There were, firstly, a number of per-
sonal and more than less offensive ones, such as
“Balmy,” “Fat,” “Stinker,” “Blowfly” and “Adol-
pus ” But among the more ingenious I discovered
“Small Pox” (the boy’s Christian name was Syd-
ney), “Treacle” (he couldn’t run fast), “Jenolan”
(from the size of his mouth), “Yes-No” (his sur-
name was Noyes), “Rabbit” (he was champion at
arithmetic—l had told them that rabbits multiplied
-apidly).
* * * *
‘‘Mann Hnina”: Unlike most countries,
Papua has got in early with a decent law protect-
ing native birds. All species of the Paradise family
are absolutely protected, and the man who is foolish
enough to risk shooting them has a fair chance of
becoming the guest of George V. for any period up
to two years, with full access to the gaol woodheap
and the use of the official axe. Even with this
deterrent there have been breaches of the ordinance,
and only recently two gentlemen were handed out
big helpings of gaol for trying to make a “rise by
getting birdskins for Parisian hat-carpenters.
Besides the Paradise fowls, the goura or giant pigeon,
the lesser white heron, and, within 10 miles of the
coast, the scrub fowl are protected by the ordi-
nance. The goura is a bird that wanted protection,
for it is about the silliest creature in the feathered
line. When startled in the jungle it simply flies to
the nearest sapling, seats itself, and looks at the
intruder. It always puts me in mind of what a fat
old gentleman of the peace-at-any-price crowd would
look like when chased down George-street by a herd
of Japs; only I understand saplings to climb into
are scarce in George-street. The heron is the owner
of some fine white plumes, which it carries
round as a tail; and as modern Eve likes
white plumes, the Government had to hop
in early to prevent the slaughter of the inno-
cent. The goura wears a delightful crest of feathers
that are a slaty blue, and these are worth about half
a dollar to the murderer ; hence this unfortunate is
protected. All birds on the list are absolutely pro-
tected. There is no “close season.” The whole year
round is closed.
“Ahaswer” : Our cat is dead. He was a
black cat who adopted us on our arrival in our new
house. The second day after his advent I was fond-
ling him, when he tore my hand. Henceforth he
was called Claud. Later in the year, he undeceived
us as to sex by bringing into the world a litter of
kittens. We were surprised. Two weeks later 1
was up the ladder, cleaning the spouts, and coming
down put my foot, with some 13st. above it, upon
the head of one of the kittens. It squirmed and
twisted for a few minutes, then lay still. Claud
came running up and licked the poor dead thing.
The grief and affection of the dumb beast made me
feel ashamed of myself. But in one minute- my
shame was turned to disgust. Claud was eating the
dead kitten. As I said before, our cat is dead.
SOMETHING TO
LOOK FORWARD TO.
“Now, my deah children,
I want you all to join me in
singing that bee-utiful hymn, which I hope and trust we will all sing together in the
Great Beyond, ' Heah We Suffer Grief and Pain.’”
“Tiaki”: Henare’s larder was nearly
always well filled in the pre-pakeha days. One of
the most useful of creeping plants known to him
was the kickie (Freycinetia banlcsii), from which he
procured “tawhara,” which are the large flesh-like
white petals, something like those of the magnolia,
only much larger, thicker and more brittle. These
were (and are now, when opportunity offers) gath-
ered into a bowl or calabash and allowed to ripen
by sweating. They taste like apple and banana
mixed, with an indescribable flavoring thrown in.
The green leaves are dried, bleached and dyed, to be
made up into hats, mats, girdles, etc. The fruit
(ureure) is something like a long, narrow green
pineapple, and in taste is a compound of pear, pine-
apple and banana. These were great delicacies with
Henare of old; and, even now, he will mount his
auto and stir up 60 miles of dust for a feed of
tawhara. If eaten when unripe it produces a sort
of third-rate razzle-dazzle, with superior headache
accompaniments. Karaka berries are still plentiful
on the coast. Although the flesh is eaten, the
poisonous woody kernel (the nuts proper) are the
genuine goods. These are steeped in water for
months, and the fleshy part is trampled away by
the bare feet of Henare and Meri. The nuts are
then cooked in ovens, and are ready for the table.
They are very nutritious when treated by this
recipe; but, if eaten raw, or not thoroughly cooked,
the eater generally forms the chief excuse for a
tangi. I have devoured hundredweights and am
still writing pars., but Tutongi, who thought he was
poison-pfloof, tried the unfinished article, and he
writes no pars.
BEASTLY INSULT.
“ What's the matter, deah boy?”
“ Oh, that beastly artist chappie has this filthy
fellow in the same picture with us, don’t

of a crow' can be extended enough to enclose *
largo an object. I am after reliable information* 1
and no liar need tell me that the hen-fruit is cun'
veyed in a peggy-bag.
The white ant of Northern Queensland,
according to Swedish scientist Mjoberg, who has
been fossicking around those parts for a year or so,
believes in the raising of the dead. The Professor
sliced off the apex of several of the cone-shaped
nests, and found galleries filled with the remains of
the departed. He could never find any dead ants in
other parts of the nests, and as each colony consists
of some 10,000, the daily mortality must be con-
siderable. As a test he opened the base of one
mound, killed 20 of the householders, painted the
corpses red, and replaced them on the ground floor.
A few days later he burgled the garret, and found
16 red corpses in the upper galleries. From this he
concludes that the ants always carry their dead up-
stairs. Owing to the sun’s heat —which is naturally
greatest at the top of the cone —the remains are soon
reduced to powder, which is removed to a lower
chamber. This, of course, may signify respect for the
ashes of their relatives, but the Professor’s theory
is that the ants regard the ashes as a table delicacy.
“The Maorilander” : I take solemn excep-
tion to “D.L.II.’s” statement re the order of things
discussable and discussed in bush camps. Time was
when Horse, good, bad or indifferent, black, lay or
brindle, was the staple article of conversation among
the never-nevers and just-beyonds; but now the best
he can get is a very tired third. Of course, occasion-
ally, as at Cup-time or bush race-time, he may
again get his nose in front for a day and a night,
but I stoutly affirm that the only possible subject
which will keep a bloke from seeking his virtuous
couch in mustering or droving camps is Woman.
She can be unmarried, but the most
discussed shes in the bush are married,
mostly much-married. My last trip
was to the Cooper with jumbucks, and
I learnt more then about the wilful
ways of Woman from those sheep-hos
than a man could ever learn from all
the houris of Mahomet’s heaven. Me
had Woman in the morning early
while the horse-tailer was hunting
horses; Woman on dinner-camp, and
Woman after tea. I have seen blue
forked lightning whistling over the
sheep-break as Jim Lawrence told how
he and “The Winning Way” worked

“dad” related how his wife died. Hav-

YOUR ADVANTAGES.
There are a number of distinct ADVANTAGES TO YOURSELF in buying a Beale Piano in preference to any other. Mere are
some of them :
1. You make a Big; Saving in Price, Quality for Quality.
You buy your Beale Piano direct from the factory, without paying profits to any middlemen or agen s, an
without paying the 35 per cent. Customs duty.
2. You get a Better=toned Piano. . , 1 ,
Beale Pianos have a most harmonious, mellow, delightful tone. They contain the on y success u see
tuning-s} T stem ever invented, and by means of this device the tuning-pins are him \ or a ir T“’
confining all sound to the sounding-board , which is the only proper construction.. This invention ma ie
piano more durable, because the iron frame alone bears all the tremendous strain (near y tons ) o ewo
hundred and sixteen tightly-stretched steel strings. This construction cannot be had m any other pianos.
3. A Better=toned Piano because, also, of the Violin=like Sounding Board.
Only Beale Pianos contain sounding-boards constructed on the same principle as a vio m e y.. "
construction, and our secret sounding-board varnish, are responsible for that splendid tone which wins
favor with singers especially. The Beale tone is sympathetic, sweet, .mellow, sonorous an .’. ii
tone of Beale Pianos, beautiful at first, improves with use. This is the sure test of an artisti y-
constructed piano.
4. You get a Longer=lasting Piano. , . , -ii
Beale Pianos are made in the Australian climate, of timber seasoned, m the climate, so th y
withstand the Australian climate better than pianos which are made in cold, wet countries.
5. Your Beale Piano will have a Better Touch. • r> i r> vmi
We supply a better “ action ’’-one of the most expensive parts of the instrument m Beale Plan >

THINNESS IS DANGEROUS.
EMINENT SPECIALIST TELLS HOW
THIN PEOPLE MAY PUT ON FLESH
AND BECOME STRONG, PLUMP AND
HEALTHY.
Thinness is unnatural and dangerous. It
is not necessarily the cause of consumption,
indigestion, liver or catarrhal trouble; but
in nearly every instance it is an indication
that something is radically wrong. Very
thin people may feel that they are perfectly
well; but after 30 years of active experience
I can truly say that I have never seen an
extremely thin man or woman who was
really healthy. Thin people are thin because
they do not assimilate their food properly.
They may eat heartily, but their food does
not make flesh, simply because the assimila-
tive organs are lacking in nerve force. Tins
is why thin people are so often nervous,
sleepless and become addicted to the use ot
drugs. To supply this nerve force a nerve
food must be taken, and I have had remark-
able results in nearly every case from the
use of a tonic nerve food which contains no
drugs, consisting of Aoz. Tincture of Car-
damoms Compound, 8.P., 20z., Salrado t om-
pound, 3oz. Elixir Simplex and enough
water to fill an Boz. bottle. One to two
tablespoonfuls should be taken before each
meal, or whenever excessive fatigue _or de-
pression is felt. Any chemist can readily pre-
pare this formula, and as it is Avidely recog-
nised for its unusual efficacy, many chemists
now keep it in stock ready for use under the
name of Salrado Tonic. The increase m
weight following the use of this tonic is re-
markable, the nervousness, sleeplessness ami
other unnatural symptoms all disappear,
dull eyes become bright and pale cheeks glow
with the bloom of perfect health. —A.L.M-
“Tiaki” : This was the most tangled piece
of interpreting I ever took a hand in. Pakira, who
was deaf and dumb, wanted to converse with Jen
Jensen, a Swede. Paora would tell me in Maori
what Pakiri said —conveyed to him by signs. I
passed on Paora’s talk in English to Carl Carlson,
and Carl, who could “spik Inkliss,” passed it on to
Jen Jensen. Then the clutch was thrown out and the
machinery reversed, the line straightened out again,
and the answer, like a football, was passed back to
the dummy.

“Y.Z.”: Some fortunate peonle on the
road from Macedon to Melbourne enjoyed the spec-
tacle of a cow driving a motor-car one afternoon
during Cup carnival. The hog in the car is a com-
mon feature of this stretch of landscape, but novelty
attaches to the vision of a brindle cow careering
down hill in apparent sole possession of a £7OO
car. The familiar joy-ride was in progress, when
five gaudy roysterers struck the natural wet-nurse of
a dappled calf. The car was rushing down a steep
place at the time, and it whipped in under the unsus-
pecting four-cornered creature, taking her in the
rear, and picking her up with the precision of a Cin-
quevalli. When the manoeuvre was through, two bar-
maids and a stockbroker were scattered along the
track, a commercial traveller was on his head in a
furze hedge, and a brindle cow was sitting hard
down on the hapless chauffeur, driving down the
wind-swept hill. The cow-driver continued her tem-
pestuous career for three quarters of a mile, pursued
by an auxiliary motor, two excited horsemen, and all
available pedestrians. Collision with a tree shot
Cow out again, and she loped back in quest of her
calf, little the worse for her intrusion into the rakes’
progress. But the motor, the chauffeur, the man
who dived into the hedge, and the blonde barmaid
were all more or less broken or bent, and had to be
removed with gingerly care to suitable institutions
in which repairs are executed with neatness and
despatch.
MOTOR ACCESSORIES.
Motor Fiend (in the rear car): “See Binks
has fitted a new siren to his car."
Friend (whose thoughts run in other channels):
“ Yes, and isn't she a little peach,too! ”
“Xox’G At Richmond (Q.), in the early
days, before the advent pf the professional sky-pilot,
the burial service over the Protestant dead was in-
cantated by an amiable citizen of some branch.of that
numerous persuasion, whilst the defunct R.O.’s were
wished bon voyage by a layman from Rome. It hap-
pened occasionally that a resident or stranger would
depart this fleeting show and leave behind him no
clue as to what his religious .unbeliefs were. In such
an emergency the R.C. burial reciter and the Pro-
testant funeral elocutionist would retire to the back
yard at the pub and toss. The loser read the service.
STILL ANOTHER OPTICA L ILLUSION.
DRUNK (who is buying the supper): “Great Scott ! One o’clock, and I (hie) promished
to be o'me by ten! ”
“Silas Snell” : I have nothing to say against
the police. They have often left me alone in cir-
cumstances in which interference on their part might
have been justifiable. But I want to tell the story
of Dosset and his three pretty daughters, Esther,
Annie and Honor, which involves
an important section of the his-
tories of Mahon, Magill and Day-
ley. Dosset lived at Sheepskin.
Sheepskin is in Victoria, but at
present is masquerading under an-
other name. Dosset was the chief
citizen of Sheepskin. He had
selected 300 acres, and each
daughter had followed a worthy
example, and also taken up 300
acres. The land was good, the
cows were kind, and Dosset was
reputed to be a man of means,
although there were hints that he
was not content with the good
that came to him in the practice
of his honorable profession as
pastoralist and tiller of the soil.
It was whispered that Dosset was
most expert in the mysteries of
another business, success in which
necessitated much dodging and
ducking of the law. Dosset did
nothing to encourage suitors for
the hands of Esther, Annie and
Honor, hating the idea of having
any of those 300-acre blocks torn
from his holding. But constable
Mahon had not been at Sheepskin
three months before his engage-
ment to Honor was announced. He
married with Honor, and left the
Force, to become a 300-acre squat-
ter on Honor's little lot. Magill
came next to Sheepskin. Magill
was a man of large habit, and
studious in his movements. It
took him 14 months to get en-
gaged to Annie. The new-married
couple took over Annie’s land.
Ere this, constable Dayley had
succeeded to the guardianship of
Sheepskin. It was 17 months
later when he presented himself
at Dosset’s house with a polite
request for the hand of Esther.
His arguments were convincing.
After the ceremony, Dosset, in the
presence of his three ex-constabu-
lary sons-in-law, exclaimed: “Well, here goes my last
daughter, and 1 don’t know what the
I am going to do if another sneaking police-
man pokes his nose into that still of mine!”
“Gouger” : Along the Palmer, the Gilbert,
the Percy and the hundreds of miles in between —in
fact, all over the gold-bearing country of N.Q. —the
white prospector drops on gullies worked clean as a
board floor. Evidence, in the shape of Chinese wine
bottles and provision jars, always points to the
nationality of the prospectors. No fear of a party
of Chows notifying their discovery of gold; no
chance of a white man ever knowing, unless he
stumbles on their old camp long after they and the
gold have done the disappearing trick. This fact
gave me a sad bump on a prospecting trip a few
months ago away beyond the Palmer. We camped
on the river bank, right alongside the pack track to
Mt. Windsor tinfield; and only a bare hundred
yards from the track I came across seven gullies, all
completely woil.ed. One of them was nearly two
miles long. We were surprised, having never heard
that gold was found so close to the river in that
part. The mystery was cleared by the Mt. Windsor
Chow packer a little later. It appears that about
five years ago the Cooktown warden cleared the
Chinks from Mt. Windsor, so they came down to the
Palmer, found these gullies, and, naturally enough,
worked them, saying nothing to the white miner, of
course. “Big gully welly lich gold,” added the
packer. When the gold was worked out they re-
turned to Mt. Windsor, as the warden had gone.
Some long time after they were again cleared out,
but yet again they returned. “Warden he come,
we go; warden he go, we come” ; and so on, ad
infinitum. The tenacity of the Asiatic in Australia
as regards our despised North makes a man do a bit
of a think at times.
* * * *
“Kikori”: The colored brethren of the
island of Goaribari, in the delta of the Purari and
Kikori rivers (Papua), are a cheerful crowd," but
soon, no doubt, many of the pleasing customs of this
hospitable people will be lost. The first public ad-
vertisement that came to them was through their
welcome to two missionaries, the R,evs. Chalmers
and Tompkins, and their boat’s-crew of native evan-
gelists. All who landed were eaten. The survivors
—those who had not landed—went off with much
despatch to Daru, and thence came a party of angry
Europeans who mopped up many of the leading citi-
zens in a most thorough manner, the said leading
citizens not having had much experience in arguing
with .303. Later on, after a “peace” had been fixed
up with the survivors, the Papuan yacht Merrie
England came along with Lieut.-Governor Robinson
on board. He managed to visit the island and re-
turn to his ship without being punctured by the
arrows of the friendly citizens; but through the
idiotic conduct of one of his staff, who enticed some
of the natives aboard and then tried to arrest them,
the mob of excited savages got wild and endeavored
to take the ship. The result was disastrous to both
the savages and the Governor; for the cannibals
were only beaten off with some loss, and, later on,
the Governor himself died as the result of persecu-
tion by the very people whom he had helped and
succored in every part of the Territory. Since this
last excitement things have become much more
peaceful. No doubt Staniforth Smith contributed
much towards their civilisation when he went on his
exploring expedition up the Kikori, and nearly got
himself drowned and killed several times. Whether
the diet of missionary has had anything to do with
their morals is hard to say, but judging bv the
friendly manner in which the ladies treat visitors, it
might be some improvement if they changed their
diet. Quite recently a most worthy missionary
visited the island in his launch, and gave the
heathen some little spiritual comfort. The savages
behaved themselves beautifully at the service, and
the missionary was most impressed. By the' time
the sun sank behind the mangroves the parson had
done what he considered was a most happy day’s
work, and he sought his yacht in a very well-con-
tented frame of mind. Then the hospitable natives
came along, and the poor man was rudely awakened
by the arrival of some dozen ladies who all made
most improper proposals; and on his hunting them
away their fathers and brothers were quite upset, for
they were only showing their appreciation of ’ the
holy gentleman’s sermon in the most practical way
that they knew of. After much thought, they decided
that, possibly, the ladies had not been up to the
pious one’s standard, so they immediately brought
off a younger detachment, only to see them also
chased overboard. Another lot fared the same fate,
and then the reverend gentleman got up his anchor
and fled, preferring rather to risk dissolution in
the thundering surf on the bar than irreparable
damage to his soul.
“The squeaky brake is to be suppressed. Many

Melbourne City Council has drafted a by-law specifi-

Dddyson : Mrs. Martin Phinn— “whin
two n*s»—■ was extremely ill, and the good o, 11
doctor had been with her and had prescribed mP T
cines thick, black and ominous, and pills which
quote Mrs. Phinn, where “the red eyeballs iv’tp
holy Devil himself.” Looking upon these thim
Mrs. Phinn was convinced that the final dissolution
was at hand. “ ’Tiz ez good ez dead 1 am, Phinnv
dear,” said the stricken woman. “Will y e h
sendin’ for Mrs. Widdy Moran this noon?”
Moran came in haste to receive the last wishes of
the poor Norah. “Nothin’ but a dead woman is i
talkin’ wid yeh, Mrs. Moran, ma’am,” faltered Mrs
Phinn ; “an’ there’s me man t’ be done by an’ me
little childther needin’ the mother’s hand whin
they’re misbehavin’, an’ the like. I’m sinkin’ fast
ma’am. Divil a hope is there for me. Will ye h look
wanst et th’ dthrugs give me, black wid mournin’
an’ me so young, an’ me childther growin’ up wan be
wan, an’ himself th’ bad head fer d’alin’ an’ manage-
ment? Will ye be grantin’ me last wish, Widely
Moran, ma’am? Will yeh marry me man when I'm
gone?” “I will, Mrs. Phinn —I will that! 'Ti s
conthrary t' me inclination in a manner, but Brigifi
Moran’s no woman t' be denyin’ th’ longin’s iv th’
dead, rest their souls.” Mr. Martin Phinn was
called in. “D'yeh mind I’m dyin’, yeh crazy scare-
crow?” said Mrs. Phinn, sharply. “I do, Norah - I
mind it well.” “Well, then, will yeh wake up an'
be marrvin’ wid th’ Widdy Moran when I’m gone
t’ bake an’ clean yeh, an’ bake an’ clean an’ dress me
childther?” “I will that, Norah, dear,” said Phinn
meekly. “Then take ye both an’ go be th’ kitchen
t' begin ver courtin', fer there’s no time t’ waste at
all. Let me hear ye be sayin’ the sweet worrds an'
squeezin’ an’ kissing be each other both, that 1 may
tell yeer thrue t’ me an’ veer promise, so help yeh
heaven.” Bridget Moran and Martin Phinn went
into the kitchen, hand in hand. “Lave the dure
open wide, an’ sit ye where I can see whin I have
me mind to,” ordered the sick woman. And Bridget
and Martin sat on the big box just inside the kit-
chen, and Martin put his arm round Bridget, and
kissed her diffidently once, and Bridget sat very
still. “Yeh’ll nade be givin’ him much encourage-
ment an’ dthrawin’ him on a great dale, Mrs. Moran,
ma’am, I'm thinkin’,” said Mrs. Phinn weaklv!
“Ilimself’s no frisky rascal, an’ never was at ail.
Yeh’ll kiss him yerself in betwixt, an' caress him
most times, same as he was a bearable man wid the
fine eye to him an’ th’ bold figure.” The widow
kissed Phinn, and put an arm about his neck.
“ ’Twill do fer th’ time, ma’am,” said Mrs. Phinn.
“Ye’ll come again in th’ avenins, an’ get yer courtin’
well over bechune this an' me dyin'.” Mrs. Moran
came every evening, and sat by Phinn's side on the
box in the kitchen, and courted Martin Phinn, and
presently there was no need for Mrs. Phinn to prompt
and encourage the lovers. “ ’Tis very lifelike an'
earnest ye are,” said the bedridden woman on the
third night. I belave yeh mane well be me, an’ yeh
can shut th’ dure.” The courting went on for a fort-
night, and Mrs. Phinn sat and listened to the
kisses, and the little chirruping giggle of the widow,
and Martin’s foolish laughing, and his more foolish
words, and she grew no worse. Indeed, it came
about that she found a curious and most unreasonable
resentment growing in her heart. “Nothin’ can I
make iv it,” said she to herself. “ ’Tis me own
maltin’ an’ me own doin’, an’ me the dyin’ woman.
For why should I mind?” But she did mind. That
fact came home to her as she grew stronger, and
the warmth of Phinn's wooing of Bridget and
Bridget’s wooing of Phinn increased, and their fre-
quent unconsciousness of her presence was mani-
fested in the shrill coquetry of the widow and in
Martin’s loud blowing and the mendacity of him.
One night the lovers sat together on the box, their
arms about each other, the widow’s black head
nestled in the hollow of the neck of Martin Phinn,
and Phinn was saying: “Love you, is it? Don’t I
love you betther an’ sthronger an’ braver than iver
woman was loved be ragin’, tearin’ soljer ’r man
iv anny kind, giant or shmall?” when the dooi
softly opened, and Mrs. Martin Phinn in her white
bedgown stepped into the room, with a broom handle
in her right hand. “Out iv me house, yeh ondacent
woman of Babbling! she said, and she fetched Mrs.
Moran a sound clip over the head with her broom-
handle. “Rilase her from yer blatherin’ lies an’
poethry talk, an’ go about yer business, yeh smoogin’,
canoodlin’, thrip’ny Don June, yeh!” and she
whacked Phinn on the sconce till his few poor brains
hummed in his head. “Are yeh goin’, me lady?”
She hit Mrs. Moran again. She beat the screaming
unfortunate out of the kitchen, down through the
yard garden, and out by the back gate. “0 ma’am,
Mrs. Phinn, is it mad yiv clane gone?” wailed the
afflicted widow. “Didn't yourself ax me t’ have
him ? Wasn’t I doin’ yeh th’ kindness be offerin’ t’
clane fer himself an’ t’ bake him an’ the childther?
What d’yeh. mane be such misconduct an’ murther?”
“I mane, ma’am,” cried Mrs. Phinn, shaking her
stick, “that I’ve changed me mind, I have, an’, wid
your leave, I'll clane him meself, an’ I'll bake him
meself, an' so good-night t’ yeh.” Mrs. Phinn is
still clanin’ an’ keepin’ the childther, an’ bakin’
himself, an’ washin’ an’ th’ like; and if Bridget
Moran ventures within a hundred yards of Phinn’s
three-acre block at Dungaree she gets nothing but
the long and bitter taste of a potstick for her
temerity.
PAINTING THE LILY OF DRINK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No intoxicating drinks arc for sale at Norfolk
Island. But Mr. Finlayson wants the principle
grafted on by law. —Report of House of Reps.
In a strictly legal sense, we are not teetotal. Hence
The anxiety of distant politicians.
There is nothing here to drink, and we’d have hard
work to sink
Half a pint. On that we’d give some exhibitions
Of besotted savagery, by the wild and salted sea —
Something bad enough to make the Island rue it.
Still, though anchored safely now, we will make a
joyful row
When the Law expressly tells us not to do it.
Though you’re very, very good,
And you wouldn’t if you could,
And the cursed drink is nowhere to be had,
Yet it’s comforting to be
Bound to strict sobrietee
By a law upon the Statute Book, my lad.

IT’S THORNE’S
“I NCOMPARABLE.”
AFTER any sport a glass of
Thorne’s Whisky has a
direct appeal —it is incom-
parable. Essentially a gentle-
man’s drink, Thorne’s Whisky
is a fine Old Highland Malt —
typically Scotch —and it em-
bodies the elements of the famed
production of Glenhvet —the
traditional home of Scotch
Whisky.
It is especially refreshing, and
the mellow maturity, rich flavor
and purity attract and gratify.
During 80 years, Thorne’s
has achieved a splendid reputa-
tion which every fresh bottle
strengthens and enhances.

“Y.Z.”: I saw first mention of the threat of the
proprietors of London Punch to alter the cover of
that sacred publication about six months ago. It
was in a Liberal daily, and sounded like a pre-
diction of doom. Soon after the papers of the
Empire were sprinkled with feverish references to
the meditated rash act. You would have thought a
gunpowder plot was afoot to blow up Parliame t
and warp the Constitution. Australian papers took
alarm. One illustrated Melbourne weekly devoted a
whole page to the disturbing rumor that lDKii s
cover was about to undergo alterations. Every editor
in sight seemed more than a little shocked. Ihe pie-
vailing impression was apparent on the surface o
900 articles and paragraphs —this was the be j£™ y’
of the end ; old England was about to be plunged into
the seething vortex of mad American methods; the
Empire was tottering, aim the heavens might be
expected to fall by Octobci 10, at about 2 p.m.
Then the change happened, anti London Punch was
found to have suffused its exterior with two faint,
apologetic tints and a slight derangement of its
customary emblems. Britannia s chin was still above
water when the mail left, and our understanding of
the capacity of John Bull to make a fuss abou
trifles is vastly enlarged. * *
A striking personality on the N.S.AV. South Coast
“hinterland” is John Gale, of the Retreat, Quean-
beyan, newspaper proprietor coroner, etc., etc mo
represented the Murrumbidgee in the Leg sLtive
Assembly of 1887-89, when he had as colleagues
James Gormley and G. R. Hibbs. One Parliament
was enough for him. He is now 83 years of age, and
for something like half a century has been ?roprietoi
of the Queanbevan Age. (In the mid- <3O s the
paper was the Golden Age.) Mentally and physi-
callv he is better than many men 30 years his
iunior. He writes voluminously, toils abundantly,
and exploits the mountain streams 40 or 50 miles
from his home in search of the trout which nearly 30
years ago he was the first to introduce into the
waters of those parts. 4
Thev had been out electioneering—the leader of a
Great'Party, his wife and two pressmen—when the
motor-car was stopped by the body organiser, who
conveyed an invitation from one of N_ S. V aies s
famous stations to pull in and partake of hospitalitw
As the pressmen were not known to be aboard the
car, a telephone message was sent to expect four,
the trade of the extras being mentioned. Oh, yes
came the answer from the other end, of course, they
will be provided for ; but —er —do the —er —reportahs
dine at the same table as Mr. Blank ?’

“Kodak”: Usually I enjoy these gritty bits of in-
formation with which daily-paper printers fill m the
foot of a column. After about a furlong or so of
insincere oratorical blither or political flam, it is
refreshing to come upon something definite and in-
formative like this: “In Madrid there are public
bars for dogs every half-mile.” If you have one of
those lumber-room memories, you may store it up
for yourself or for presentation to a travelling friend.
Such scraps may evert be used conversationally by a
certain type to impress people. Some time ago i
read with interest and pleasure the following para-
graph: “In Pekin the only shops that are glassed-m
are the jewellers’.” It isn’t often that we get any-
thing about Pekin, and I automatically stored up the
item as being something valuable and out of the
way. Two days later, my eye slid off a dull political
item and got'on to, “In Pekin the only shops that
are glassed-in” I stopped there gratefully. I
knew just what the paragraph was about, but i
didn’t resent the repetition of the item, because 1
had forgotten the information it contained, and was
glad of a reminder. It was an evening paper that
tried to instruct me next time. I got as far as
“glassed-in” before I stopped reading. It struck me
then that the liar, was being overworked; but i
nearly read it again the same day in a weekly print
Since' then I have shied off it violently about eight
times in various journals. Now I am reduced to
such a state of mind that I cannot bear to look at a
paragraph about China, because it may have that
information stuffed into it in a different way. I
am afraid now that some choice item about fash
markets in Japan will become fashionable with
printers.
“Penman”: That wag, the comp. ! His latest, from
America. A Republican got into a Democratic news-
paper office, and put this through: “The snouts of
10,000 Democrats rent the air” ! A preacher was
reported: “I will never preach in this d— church
again.” But that may have been the reporter, because
the preacher protests that he sajd “damp. A
comp., setting up a leader based on an alleged news
par. in another column, smuggled in: Reading
between the lies in another part of this issue. It
would not be decent to print again what a Mel-
bourne morning newspaper made of “wine-producing
grapes.” The comp, got two letters out of the w.
A London Times reporter made Peel say, “There may
be a b —y time.” An Australian newspaper had a
compositor named Drjp In the middle of some
gorgeous writing on the Melbourne Cup
appeared the mysterious words “Dry follows.
“STS”' The word “oval” —meaning a sports
ground-takes its place in the heavier Australian
literature, by the unlikely route of Dr. Radford s
Moorhouse Lectures on Heresy. Preachers he says,
fail in their appeal because they use Elizabethan
English, while their hearers “know only the lan-
o-uao-e of the oval and the exchange, the newspaper
and° the magazine.” Yet Radford has nothing to
do with South Aus.: if he had, his use of the word
wouldn’t be surprising. In Adelaide, the chief
cricket-ground was for some reason named after
Kennington Oval; then each suburb, and each
country township, wanted an Oval, too, so
the word became a matter of course all over
the State. And it is a good word—short, unam-
biguous, and really appropriate, because the oval-
shape is approved as the best for nearly all spoits.
AVhy not adopt it universally as a common noun t
“Red and Blue”: At the rooms of the first doctor
I called on I picked up a newspaper and saw the
headine: “Russian Arms Again Defeated. idutto,
I thought, “another war!” On looking lor the
date of the journal I found it was January, 1904.
At the second and third and fourth my experience
was much the same. Do these doctor and
dentist fellows buy up secondhand magazines
and papers, and, after pickling them for
a few years, place them for the inspection
their patients? In the private office of a leading
surgeon there was a calendar for 1907 hanging on
the wall, and in one dentist’s waiting-room the
only literature was a Bible. As for myse , “
modern and unregenerate, prickly pears spring up
in my Garden of Joy if I read any paper that says
nothing about X-ray skirts. * *
“Umfaan”: Here’s the chance of a lifetime. It is
worth the attention of even the affluent scnbes who
sign their names during election campaigns. Russia,
mini, gory, expansive Russia, is offering it—the
most valuable literary prize ever offered in open
competition. The subject appointed is a study of
the life and work of Czar Alexander I. The hrst
prize is about £200,000, and £lOO 000 will be
tributed in consolation prizes. In 1833, Al ® xan
Minister, Ararkcheef, deposited a sum in Bank
of St. Petersburg with directions that it should De
allowed to accumulate at compound interest until
1925. Hence the colossal prizes. Ive always
thought that Russian should be compulsory language
in our State schools. Now I’m sure.
* * * *
“Nightowl”: It strikes me that the point of attack
for advocates of passable journalism shouldn’t be the
crudeness of junior reporters and country correspon-
dents. In all trades the recruits make _ mistakes
wholesale. The thing is to so run the business that
the ill-made product doesn't go out to customers. 1
reckon the most prominent exhibitors of bad journal-
ism—and the most harmful, too, because they are
taken to be the models they ought to be —are some
of the Great Dailies. There isn’t much of an elevat-
ing influence about a paper that swells its chest in
the leader columns over “the necessity for populating
our empty spaces,” and accepts 6d. for a “no encum-
brance” advt. amongst the “Wanteds,” and Is. for a
thinly-disguised abortionist’s card in some other
purlieu of the paper. The minor sin of bad Eng-
lish stands out like a bowsprit or an eruption over a
big part of the news. The doctor who pronounces
life extinct,” the singer who “gives a pleasing ren-
dition at an enjoyable function,” and the deceased,
who had “reached the allotted span,- pass the sub-
editor’s pen unchallenged; and the cub, unreproved,
sees that they are good and makes others after their
own imago. I don’t know the conditions under which
the raw material is recruited down South, but here
in Queensland the question whether the nice-looking
voung man who wants to learn to be an
editor can write decent English to begin with
doesn’t seem to trouble the bosses much. Also
although the fellow who does the Political Points may
caper a bit in his column, it’s not healthy for a
junior to try to get a joke through. Promotion lies,
not in brightness but in gloom, punctuality and the
safe path of set expression. And, above all, you
must not make the honored name of Alderman N. P.
,1. Bloggs appear as Alderman N. B. J. Bloggs. It
may blight your whole career. Long years after-
wards, when you are drudging on a bush rag instead
of being chief of a great city organ, you may date
your downfall from the day when you made that
alderman —now dead and forgotten—a B. instead of
a P. # ,
Kn old identity of Bathurst (N.S.W.), John
Stanley, has gone over at 79. In the golden days
he was on the staff of Dan Mavne’s very warm
Sentinel. Dan, the Sentinel, Stanley—all are gone
novv - .
“Locust”: By the wav, there has been a revival
of Dr Fred (“Whiskers”) Ward as an after-dinner
speaker lately. Long ago, in the good old days
when Plancus was Consul and P. J. Holdsworth
still walked the earth. Fred Ward had a very high
prestige as an after-dinner talker. At a certain
Bohemian club, now fallen from its high and impe-
cunious estate to a successful commercial
status, Ward was regarded as the bright, slim-
ing light, and through him many a dis-
tinguished visitor took away a good impres-
sion of our post-prandial talking men. His recru-
descence —a suitable word, by the way, as his health
has greatly improved these days—has been a delight
to his fellow-pressmen at recent journalistic functions.
Taking him for all in all, he is probably still the best
after-dinner sneaker (not excepting the funny-man
Reid) in the Commonwealth. #
The Auckland (M.L.) Herald has been celebrating
its 50th anniversary and accenting the congratula-
tions of members of the Australasian Union of Oma-
mental Governors, as well as merely useful citizens
The first issue (Nov. 13, 1863; price 3d.) com-
prised four pages of six columns each; the jubilee
number (price Id.) contained 28 pages of eight
columns each. “Our Own Correspondent,” on Novem-
ber, 12, ’63, was busy keeping an eye on John Maori,
whose harness wasn’t fitting him a bit. It is
reported that a despatch rider had reached Drurv
after a desperate ride through an ambuscade'; that
portion of the 2nd Waikato Regiment was moving on
to ask Hori a few questions; that a detachment of
the 40th Regiment had arrived at an encampment cn
route to the front, and was received by the drums
and fifes of the 18th Regiment; that the natives
were in force at Rangariri, where the Waikatos had
just been strengthened by a large accession of war-
riors from the East Coast. In the shipping news,
Captain Pierce, in harbor from “the Whaling
Grounds,” with 600 barrels sperm and 260 barrels
whale oil aboard the barque Addison, of New Bed-
ford, reports having spoken 10 whalers (seven of
New Bedford) with varying quantities of oil. A
leading article on the native outbreak is very grave
and says: “With the daily experience of butcheries
inflicted from May 4th last, we think the time
has fully arrived to mete out to Maori assassins the
only practical measure of British retribution.” And,
listen to this: “If the Maori will not meet us in
fair fight, we must follow him in unfaltering pur-
suit. Maintaining our posts our field force should
be broken up into parties of twenties, thirties, fifties
and so on; and to each of these two or three abor-
iginal natives of Australia should be attached in the
capacity of trackers ... .We have ourselves witnessed
their powers of tracking, and we know how two or
three of them accomplished in as many weeks that
which more than a thousand armed men had failed
to compass in a couple of years.” Well, there’s this
much about the “good old days”—a man could get a
chance to do some picturesque writing occasionally.
Under the title of “Lord London,” Keble Howard
has produced in fictional form what is practically a
biographv of Lord Northcliffe, the head of the
Tlarmsworths and the millionaire proprietor of the
London Daily Mail and a host of allied papers and
periodicals. Alfred Harmsworth was hardly out of
his teens when he started an imitation Tit Bits, and
called it Answers to Correspondents—a cumbrous
enough name to kill any infant. As a matter of
fact, the venture was fast fizzling out, when young
Harmsworth had the happy thought of starting prize
competitions, and his ingenuity in devising them was
the foundation of his fortune. The old paper still
flourishes under the shorter name of Answers, but it
has been utterly eclipsed by its parent’s later enter-
prises.
Maoriland Triad, for November, hands out an
unusual dividend. The ordinary issue is a big help-
ing in itself, but. in addition, there are two supple-
ments, one of excellently selected music and another
of 12 reproductions of etchings and carbons in the
Bartlett Art Galletv, Auckland.
THE PATRIOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Patriot died in his darkened room ;
Ilis children knelt by his bed to mourn ;
His party spoke of a Nation’s Gloom ;
The Premier moved: “That the House adjourn."
His mother whispered: “Dear God, I bore him;
Could Ye not take myself before him?"
They said in the lobbies: “One good man less’’
“How will he leave them? I think he’s poor.”. .. .
“Jimmy knew more than most chaps could
guess.”....
“The operation was kill-or-cure.’’... .
“He held that seat against Wine or Wowser,
But whom will the party put there now, sir?”
But ——
A file-boy stood on a wobbly box
And brought much dust from a height sublime ;
The printer fitted the lines to blocks;
'ihe stereo-men raced hard with time;
Ami “the staunchest friend and the sternest fighter
Hew from the pen of the leader-writer. ;
The editor fiddled with head-lines black,
“Patriot Passes.” “A Great Man Dead,”
And with one deep breath as he leaned right back,
A filtliy-fingered sub-editor said:
“Thanks be to God and a prompt physician,
We’ve got him away in the city edition.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I can’t help writing. It may be there’s a germ
That lives and thrives inside my brain’s recesses,
And when it starts to play or kick or squirm
It causes this complaint that me distresses.
Although against it I am always fighting,
I can’t help writing.
Not though in scores of comments editorial
That I am not a poet I have learned;
Not though I have, as failure’s sad memorial,
A hundred tales that always were returned.
Though disappointment has been very biting,
I can’t help writing.
I’ll keep on writing, for I can’t escape it,
If editors my poem still refuse,
And if the genius with which I shape it
Is not apparent to their minds obtuse.
If they decline these lines I’m now inditing
I’ll keep on writing.

IF you come to think of it, few Christmas presents
could be more welcome in our climate than a
Sparklet Syphon—at anything like the price. It is
so beautifully made and finished that it looks worth
ever so much more than the few shillings you pay
for it. And to the man who has one, it certainly

It saves Kim money. It enables him to make a quart of delicious soda water for 2|d. —
all fresh and ready instantly, without the mess and trouble of powders and the risk of
awkward bottles. So when you give him a Sparklet Syphon, whether he lives in the
city or away in the burning back-blocks, you give him the means of making—at any
time —in any place—from any water supply—
COOL, REFRESHING DRINKS
ALL THROUGH THE SUMMER
So if you know any home that would be happier for this advantage, ask your Storekeeper
to show you a “B” Syphon at 4/-, or a “C" Syphon at 6/6. We recommend the
“C” size not because it is more expensive, but because it is more economical in use.
Whichever you buy, the friend you buy it for will remember you gratefully every hot day
next year —and for years after.

CLEANERS.
Portable and Stationary Types from 1 to
lO Voltage 110 to 250, for Con-
tinuous and Alternating Current Circuits.
The SIEMENS SUCTION CLEANER differs from every other type of
cleaner in that a special design of suction pump is used which is uniquely
suitable for this kind of work. With this pump the use of a filter is avoided,
and the dust, is discharged directly into llie drainage system, after being
rendered innocuous by thorough admixture with water. The operation of
cleaning can be carried out on practically any kind of surface, and is not
limited to removing fine dust from floor coverings. The SIEMENS
CLEANER sucks up small quantities of water, pieces of paper and string
with equal facility, and may be employed on walls, floors, ceilings and
furniture as desired.

What more welcome surprise could you give to far-off
relations and friends this Christmas than an Edison

If you have been absent for a number of years from the
home, send your parents a Christmas Greeting, or per-
haps there is an old, favorite song they would like to
hear you sing again. Make a record of it and send it
home. Your Greetings to friends could be conveyed in
the same manner.
The Edison Phonograph
and Home-Recording Outfit
affords you the opportunity to make a record of any
message you wish to send, or any song you sing. You
can do it in the privacy of your own home, and as easily
as speaking into a telephone.

ticulars of this novel method of recording your
Christmas Greetings. Send your name and address

PURE SCOTCH
W-M-n-S-K-Y
THE CHOICE OF CONNOISSEURS.
POLITICAL POINTS
“G.V.W.”: Massey and his Government
are likely to hear more about the enrolment
of Maoris amongst the special constables
collected up-country for service during the
strike. It will rankle long that Imperial
men-o’-warsmen were landed with fixed
bayonets, while others ostentatiously pre-
pared quick-firers for action; but it will
rankle longer that natives were handed clubs
wherewith to wallop white men. When the
great fight was being put up by Fat for
Chinese labor on the Rand, a proposal that
a contingent of Maoris should be despatched
to the front and let loose on the Boers was
received with such an outcry that Richard
Seddon vehemently denied that there was
any such intention on the part of the
Government. But Massey and co. appar-
ently had no such scruples. I reckon this
business will cost M.L.’s Tory Government
its place; and if no other good comes out
of it, that, at least, will be something.
“THE EQUALITY OF MAN.”
All people are equal in the eyes of the law; therefore, why should not all have a voice in the making of it?— Customs Minister Groom.
THE CHOW (speaking for United Asia): “ You welly ni’ Chilian genl’man, Mister Gloom. You help us mally your nicee Austlalian girl, ah?”
S. Australia has lost eight of its Federal
members within as many years—Kingston,
Baker, Holder, Solomon, Batchelor, Hut-
cliison, Vardon and Roberts; and not a
little man in the lot.
A hustling Laborite, with a motor-bike
and an extra supply of petrol, should be
able to capture the Benambra seat in the
Y r ic. Assembly, rendered vacant by the
death of A. W. Craven. Benambra has
fewer electors than any other Victorian com
stituency : and what with its bad roads, its
worse roads, and its missing roads, making
for the extreme inaccessibility of its popula-
tion, the district offers itself as a prize to
be won by that pioneering soul who, full of
confidence and ready replies, will go into
the farthest regions and confirm the resi-
dents in their suspicion that a “Liberal”
Government is no good to them.
One result of the N. S. Wales general elec-
tions will be to freeze Joe Cook’s, alleged
anxiety to appeal to the electors. If ever a
Government deserved defeat on its perform-
ances the Ma State Labor Government did.
Yet the electors refused to stampede towards
Liberalism. And when Jokook makes his
appeal he won’t have Holman’s political
sins to help him.
To save some expense and at the same
time fasten the two-party system saddle a
little more firmly on the back of the public
ass, it is proposed by the Government in
Tasmania that casual vacancies in the As-
sembly shall be filled by the party caucus. If
the man who is dead or has otherwise
dropped out was a Liberal, the Liberal
machine is to grind out a new member; and
the Labor caucus will do the same if the hole
lias occurred on that side. But —and this
is where the bad old two-party system will
score —if the late member should have been
so freakish as to belong to a party consist-
ing, say, of himself, then the House as a
whole is to do the nominating; which, of
course, means that the top dog for the time
being will present itself with another fang.
By way of variation The Bulletin sug-
gests that, since it is very desirable to save
expense, and by-elections are hardly ever
worth while, a coroner’s inouest should be
held on every deceased member. The jury
should be sworn to declare who, in its
opinion, would be the most suitable man to
succeed the corpse, quite independent of
party considerations. If the ex-member
wasn’t a corpse he should be a corpse within
the meaning of this Act.
“Timothy Titmouse” : That was a deli-
cate compliment George Reid paid to the
company at the feed when he said he “had
no time for straight politicians.” Joe Cook
was there. George, evidently, had time for
Joseph,
There is something infectious about the
wild, revolutionary ideas of the Labor party.
It was these fellows who, knowing nothing
of how things ought to be done, introduced
the practice of choosing Ministers by a
ballot of the party ; and now, though it is,
of course, utterly opposed to the principles
of the sacred Constitution, Digby Denham,
of Queensland, has sent out ballot papers,
asking his followers to decide who shall be
Premier in his absence. If this kind of
thing goes on, the country will presently be
in danger of getting the best available "men
as Ministers.
Owing to Party Government it looks as
though another good democrat will be kept
out of politics—G. H. Wise, who sat tor
Gippsland in the House of Reps, until last
election, when, lacking the support of either
party, he was beaten by a Fusion candidate.
Since Labor has not a chance of winning
the seat off its own bat, and knows it, the
Gippsland Labor Leagues the other day
asked Wise to sign their platform. ihis
he couldn’t honestly do. Therefore, although
Wise is in agreement with the great
majority of the party’s political planks, an
all-wool Labor man, without a hope of win-
ning the seat, and with perhaps one-
fifth of Wise’s capacity as a Democratic
reformer, is to be put up for Gippsland.
“J.H.” on the working of the party
machine: —
In order to strew the path with Labor corpses on
election day, Peake, of S. Australia, has had to do
something more even than gerrymander the districts
He has found it necessary to create a public opinion
to support his iniquitous scheme by sending out, or
sitting by while the Liberal Union out. circu-
lars to the branches of the Union requesting them to
forward resolutions in favor of the gerrymander. Some-
of the branches kicked over the traces ; for that part
of the Bill has roused the righteous wrath of
some Liberals who are no more inclined to trust
Peake with the unlimited power that the gerrymander
gives them than they were content to be bossed by
Verran. But as 'all reports have to he sent to the
press through the Liberal Union head office, the
rebels had Buckley’s show of getting their protests
printed. Some of the other less scrupulous branches
have tumbled over one another to see which could
send supporting resolutions down oftenest. Some did
it three or four times: several did it onlv twice,
though if the show hadn’t been given away they’d no
doubt have gone on repeating the dose on a gullible
public.
With 14 second ballots to decide the for-
tune of parties, N. S. Wales is confronted
with all the storm and stress of practically
a second general election. Whatever the
result, it is safe to say that the second ballot
farce is doomed, as it was the other day in
Maoriland. The most exciting scran will
rage round Enmore, where Minister for Jus-
tice D. R. Hall sought an Assembly seat
after resigning from the Leg. Council.
There will be willing contests in six more
metropolitan seats —Hurstville, Parramatta,
St. George, Waverley, Woollahra and Wil-
loughby. A Liberal is on top of the poll in
each case, excepting Willoughby; so if ever
a pullet came home to the hen-house the
Wade party’s second-ballot scheme has done
it now.
Unquestionably the wretched ventilation
of the Federal Parliament building is re-
sponsible in part for the early death of
Roberts. Previously the premises were
occupied by the Victorian Legislature, and it
is characteristic of the local animal that, in
giving up its old lair, it made itself far more
comfortable in the new one. The quarters'
in which the State sluggards meet, at the
Exhibition Building, provide excellent non-
resident club-accommodation, with modern
furnishings, handy drinks, quiet surround-
ings and every opportunity for the languid
legislator to forget his confounded platform
promises. What Federal Parliamentarians
might do is to drown the mace, burn the
funereal robes of the official with the rosette
over his backbone, take off their coats aad
proceed to legislate in the garden attache
to Parliament House, with smoking allow™
and a lemon-squash at every elbow. " M
the country wants is its money’s-worth, an
if it has to bribe its law-makers with lenl( ',
squash it doesn’t matter, so long as tm
results arrive. The tumblers would come 1
handy to throw at the Prime Minister eveo
time he used the word “tripe.’'
OUT OF IT ALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I helped to put mad Labor in;
1 helped to put Wade out;
This time I smiled at party din—
At challenge, threat and shout.
Long syne I put wild Labor in
And dragged the Wade thing out.
1 hearkened to their wild appeals
When they made evening calls;
The blessed balm that soothes and heals
Upon my memory falls,
When I remember those appeals
And those long evening calls.
Oh, I was compensated for
Past waste and treachery,
When each electioneering bore
Called round respectfully
And worked for naught his foolish jaw
And mopped and mowed at me!
1 muttered only “No” and “Yes” ;
i let each lose his soul
By promising with nimbleness
And digging each his hole.
For I had changed my home address,
And wasn’t on the roll!
N.S.W.

SPORTING NOTIONS
Somebody calling himself “Impartial”
writes to Sydney Evening News pointing out that
the Tote is a robber, as every time a sovereign goes
into the machine a shilling of it stays there. There
are six races, so at the end of the day the punter’s
20s. has shrunk to 14s. That’s all right; but, with
the Tote, the 14s. is in the punter’s pocket. With
the bookmaker it is generally the 14s. that reposes
snugly in the bag and the punter has the six.
Sometimes he doesn’t even get the six. And, in any
case, the six Which the Tote hangs on to isn’t con-
sumed by a social parasite. A fair proportion of it
goes to public purposes.
* * * *
“Normanby”: The English Jockey Club
last month forbade the use of assumed names in rac-
ing. Some of the arguments on behalf of sticking to
the old order were quaint. F’rinstanee, the names
of “Mr. Manton” and “Mr. Jersey” were cited as
the noms de courses of lady owners who needed
protection from the glare of publicity. Putting
aside “Mr. Jersey,” or Lily Langtry, as one who
should be well* able to look after herself, the case
of “Mr. Manton” may be worth consideration. The
Dowager Duchess of Montrose was about the hottest
proposition, male or female, that the English racing
world ever ran up against, which is saying some-
thing special. Only the rawest or most desperate
of trainers ever took on her nags, and it was about
as easy to get a boy to wear the “all scarlet” as it
would be to drag George Reid past a banquet.
When the duchess bore down on the Ring, the un-
spoken anguish of Aaron was something to move the
heart of the instigator of a Russian “pogrom.” The
old lady never paid her racing debts. On the other
hand, she invariably collected in person. Apart from
the fact that even a shorn Hebrew cannot very well
backslang a duchess, she had a command of language
vyhich was the admiration of every “leg” in Europe.
She was very handy with an umbrella, too, as many
of her racing intimates could testify. The idea of
its being necessary to shield a stark old warrior like
this behind an alias is absurd—and a good many of
the lady owners are in her class for self-reliance,
or nearly so, at any rate.
* * * *
Sheffield Shield cricket will commence to
rage this week-end, the campaign opening with the
meeting of Vie. and South Aus. at Melbourne. South
Aus. will miss Clem Hill, who has closed his inter-
state cricket career with the usual storm. Neither
will the Oroweaters be sustained by the presence
of W. J. Whitty; and against the full-handed team
of Victoria the chances of the Wheat State look
blue. There is going to be a severe tussle for the
Shield this season, and the form shown will decide
the selections for the trip to South Africa next year.
Although a few weeks ago a second-rate
N.S.W. XI. downed the Bananaland cricketers on their
home heath, the N.S.W. selection committee did not
utilise the return match as an opportunity to give
the colts a show. Instead, a team capable on paper
of defeating 20 Northerners has been picked; and
the general remark is, Whaffor? This sort of thing
is not to the advantage of the game.
* * * *
The tuppenny-ha’penny squabble between
Clem Hill and his district (Sturt) club has broad-
ened and deepened. He was unable to attend on the
second day of a match, and asked for a substitute.
His team allege that they had been snubbed by the
other side when asking once before, under exactly
similar conditions, ana they fielded a man short
rather than chance it again. For some reason Hill
calls this a deliberate insult, and is playing in
“picnic” Saturday afternoon games for the present.
After January 1 his new post as stipendiary racing
steward will claim him; but Adelaide races with
strict moderation, and he may play for South Aus.
at home if wanted. Family reasons prevent his going
eastward with the State team. The feeling is grow-
ing that his permanent retirement will be announced
before long.
The Australian Board of Cricket Control
is being worried by a recrudescence of the ancient
growl of “the players” over the conditions under
which trips abrawd will be made. There is no active
rebellion —there has been no opportunity to actually
kick —but there is much talk among players about
their not being available. Well, the Board need not
worry over it. If the whole crowd of those first
selected drop out there are plenty just about as good
to take their places. We have plenty of material.
The close of the sixth round of Sydney
First-Grade Cricket was a mixed affair, in which
good and Lad scores alternated. Glebe, which
smacked 412 without the aid of a single century,
overwhelmed Waverley (236) on the first innings by
176. University utterly routed North Sydney, dis-
missing it for 124 and 70. Uni. had made 174 in
the first attempt, so it required only 20 to win, and
it got 22 for one wicket. Gordon answered Redfern’s
first-attempt 208 with 349 for nine wickets, then
dismissed Redfern again for 170, and so won by 141
on the first innings. Western Suburbs (252) slew
Sydney (153) by 99 runs on the first innings; Pad-
dington (226 and 130 for two wickets) smashed
up Balmain (137) by 89 runs on the first
innings; and Petersham overthrew Central Cum-
berland by 74 runs on the first innings—
Petersham 194 and 106 ; Central Cumberland, 120 and
111 for three wickets. Only one century was made
in the afternoon, the 162 of Macartney for Gordon.
Buckle, of Glebe, carried his bat for 99; Bardsley
made 74 for Glebe, and Diamond 67 for Western
Suburbs. The champion bowler was Coogan, of Cen-
tral Cumberland, who took nine for 63. S. Moore, of
North Sydney, got seven for 66; and Dupain, of
Western Suburbs, six for 28, including the hat trick.
Coogan’s bag for the match was 15 for 134. Massie,
who got six for 30, also rendered distinguished ser-
vice to University by taking 13 for 96 in the match.
Victoria’s first inter-State cricket match
for the season—against Bananaland—-was begun on
Friday in a fitting manner before a surprisingly big
crowd; hut the Northerners utterly failed to act up
to hopes. Starting first, in ideal weather and on a
true wicket, the Queenslanders speedily fell into a
mournful procession from pavilion to wicket and
back. Rowe made 25 before being run out, Redgrave
20, McLaren 15, and Downey and Sheppard 13 each ;
the others, with Sundries, made 24 —110 altogether.
McNaughton, of East Melbourne, gathered in four
wickets for 23 runs; Cannon, of ’Roy, three for 2l>,
and Ryder two for 36. When stumps were pulled
the Yarrasiders had put together 221 for four wickets,
and wound up at tea time next day with 475, of
which Armstrong made 202 n. 0., Ransford 82, Jimmy
Matthews 62, Ryder 36, and E. V. Carroll 33. Arm-
strong’s innings was one out of the basket, but Rans-
ford was missed when four, and again, badly, when
seven. Express McLaren took four wickets for 116,
Redgrave one for 29, Rowe one for 44, Downey two
for 119, and Ironmonger one for 99. At their second
effort the Northerners did little better, and when
play closed for the day had lost five wickets for 95
runs. On Monday the rot continued, the only stand
made being that of Rowe, who hit 54 before liiernan
got him off Cannon, and the second innings ended
for 156. So Queensland was stamped flat by an
innings and 209 runs. A terrible defeat in inter-
state cricket.
A N.S.W. Bowling team was to have toured
Maoriland at Christmas, but the waterside strike caused
it to postpone its departure till January 21, and if
the trouble continues the trip will be further post-
poned. The change will make a big difference to
the composition of the team, as many players who
could have got away for the holiday season will be
unable to go later on, when the rush of ordinary life
has resumed. Still there is no lack of first-class
bowling material.
STAGG AT BAY.
After a risky 20-round hunt at the Sydney
Stadium, Sid Burns aptures the elusive Stagg.
The Summer Baseball raged as usual at
Sydney Agricultural Ground on Saturday, and dis-
closed a marked improvement in the quality of the
play. The ’bailers are now getting into good trim
and acquiring that finish which makes the game in-
teresting to watch. In the match between Petersham
and Waverley Red Sox, the scores were equal to the
end of the fifth innings—five all. Then Petersham
froze, and Red Sox, putting on four, won by nine to
five. Leichhardt just managed to struggle out with
five to the Blue Sox’s three. It was not till the
sixth innings that the Blue Sox managed to score,
and then they got the three that saved them from
utter rout. Although Leichhardt managed to score
one in the first innings, good pitching and smart
headwork prevented any repetition till the sixth
innings, when another one was added. After that
they scored every time and won through.
Saturday was a splendid day for
swimming in Sydney, but the only notable perform-
ance was that of A. W. Barry, of the Sydney Club,
who got through 100 metres of water in "lmin. 4sec.
A highly creditable performance. But, all the same,
he did not win his race, which went to a promising
junior named G. Lyons.
The Champion Eights race at N.S.W.
Rowing Association’s Regatta on Saturday on the
Parramatta River Was a mere procession. Enterprise
crew went to the front from the jump, closely pur-
sued by the Sydney Club’s boat, which showed the
Leichhardt crowd a clean pair of heels. The Leichhardt
coxswain ran his boat too close in shore, and there
were smashed oars, twisted riggers and frizzling lan-
guage ashore and afloat. Enterprise, unaffected bv the
spectacle, rowed on calmly to victory, pursued by
the hopeless Sydney crew, which was eventually
beaten by eight lengths in 19min. 27sec. for the
three miles.
The Champion Sculls at the same meeting
were far from exciting. Only three entered, and one
of them (Petersen, of the Enterprise Club) did not
start. Cox and Grant, of Balmain, fought it out
between them. The fact that both men belonged to
the same club robbed the race of interest somewhat,
and the further fact that Cox led Grant over the
whole three miles robbed it of some more. The
water was choppy at the first; but Cox rushed into it
like a duckling into slush, and got a lead of about
a length, which he proceeded to add to in a way that
was horrible. Grant made a game effort and man-
aged to reduce the gap by several lengths, and at
Searle’s monument was within cooee; but Cox
paddled home with a comfortable margin of two
lengths.
Frank Wootton, the Australian jockey in
England, is about to give up the game. He can’t
manage to keep the weight down any longer, and
will, after this season, take to training horses for
others to ride. He is about the most successful of
riders on the English turf, crowding D. Maher, the
American, for first place. Up to last mail he had
ridden 876 winners on English racecourses, including
St. Leger and Oaks. He has never won the Derby,
but once was home first in the French Grand Prix.
Judging by the forecasts, 1914 will be the
beginning of a new era in motor-bike construction,
as the result of the “Scott” win in the Tourist
Trophy Race of ’l2 and ’l3. Engines will nearly
all be two-stroke type, and of the horizontally-
opposed twin species, so to speak. The chain drive
will be standardised on all machines fitted with
variable gears, and most of the others. Also, variable
gears threaten to become standard in all touring
machines, and single gears be reserved solely for
racing contraptions. Mud guards are to be im-
proved, and quite a crowd of vibration-lessening
appliances promise to make the pastime much more
pleasant and less nerve-racking.
Sydney Telegraph’s London correspond-
ent “looks forward with confidence to the time
when people will fly in all sorts of weather from
London to Sydney”; and the D.T., backing up the
idea with a leader, suggests that an overland route
might be found. The feat isn’t going to be accom-
plished just yet. The flier could not find a route
in which he would have less than one or two sea
passages of at least 500 miles to traverse; and the
petrol tank of the modern ’plarne needs replenishing
every 150 miles. Also, part of the journey
overland would be excessively dangerous. In the
South Persian desert, for instance, it would be
necessary to have the petrol-stations guarded by
armed men. The Telegraph talks about flying
south along the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal
and the peninsula of Malacca to Singapore. Now
the whole east coast of the Bay of Bengal is covered
with a dense forest of heavy timber, and it is
necessary that aeroplanes should have easy and safe
landing-places, at comparatively short intervals,
unless disaster is to befall them and their inmates.
It was the timber problem that debarred the reck-
lessly-plucky W. E. Hart from risking the crossing
of the Blue Mountains by biplane.
Despite all the yarns to the contrary, Aus-
tralian airman “Billy” Hart is not retiring from the
sky-skimming business, and even now is at work on
a new biplane. He hopes to have the thing finished
in time to fly home from Richmond to Parramatta
to attack the Christmas turkey with his family.
W. D. Price, a son of S. Australia’s first
Labor Premier, has reached A Grade cricket for his
late father’s old district of Sturt. In the club’s last
match, against West Torrens, he got the best bowling
average—five for 50.
Westralia’s Supreme Court has consented,
rather unexpectedly, to decide a football squabble;
and last week it gave formal judgment that the
Queen’s Park Club, which had appealed to it, really
was the premier club of the South Suburbs last
season, and. is consequently entitled to hold the
Ruthven Cup ; also that the South Suburban Associa-
tion, which said the club wasn’t and isn’t the
premier, may be legally considered a liar, and can
pay everybody’s costs.
The long-standing Australasian one-hour
paced bike record of 31 miles 1425 yards, put up by
“Plugger” Bill Martin in the dim past, has been
burst at last. That record was regarded as immortal,
but C. Wilson broke right through it by whirling
over 34 miles 265 yards at Newcastle (N.S.W.).
The flight of Australia’s crack cyclists
still continues, and on the Orama, which leaves Mel-
bourne to-morrow, will be Don Kirkham, I. R.
Munro, C. A. Piercey and C. Snell. They leave the
steamer at Toulon, France, and then rail to Paris,
where some of them will take part in the forthcom-
ing six-days’ race. But the real objective is the
series of big French road races, such as the Roubaix-
Paris and Tour de France. This is the first time
Australia will be represented in these “classic”
events, and provided the team can strike form it
should do well. It is, barring P. O’Shea, Maoriland
road champion and Australasian road champion in
1912, the cream of the six States.
* * * *
N. S. Wales long-distance road champion
E. D. Pederson is now definitely regarded as a likely
Australian representative at the Olympic Road Cycle
Race at Berlin in 1916 —which is looking ahead
somewhat. But Pederson is working hard to achieve
the enduring form that the world’s best cyclists seem
to acquire, and early next year will make an effort
to establish an Australian amateur one-hour-unpaced
track record.
E. A. Pearson’s 49 hours’ bicycle record
between Sydney and Melbourne, which has stood
since 1910, is to be assailed next Easter by Sydney
rider S. H. Goodhew. Pearson’s ride, a wonderful
performance, will be hard to beat. He absolutely
rode the whole distance —didn’t walk up a single
hill—and completed the journey without sleep. It’s
a strenuous game.

Stanley Burtinshaw picked up the first
of the N.S.W. cycling championships of the season
at Sydney Sports Ground last week, when he annexed
the mile. Sixteeen riders competed in four heats;
and, in the final, Burtinshaw, R. Clark, C. Cutcliffe
and A. Beck flashed across the line in that order.
Sovonara continued her victorious career
on Saturday by winning the Sydney Yacht Squadron’s
ocean race for the Carlton Cup over a 29-mile eourse.
The weather was delightful, the wind steady, and
everything on the ocean lovely. The only other com-
petitors were Culwulla 111. and White Wings. The
rounding mark was laid about a mile east of Cape
Banks, and Sayonara led the squadron round it, with
the others following in the order mentioned above.
So far the Wings was about eight minutes inside her
time and doing splendidly. Then, as the yacht jibed,
crash went the topmast, and White Wings was out
of the race. The other two had a great run home,
where Sayonara arrived first, 3min. 55sec. ahead of
Culwulla. The latter’s time allowance was three
minutes, so she lost the race by 55 seconds —a close
thing in a 29-mile run. In spite of her crippled
condition White Wings struggled home only half an
hour later.

About 12,000 people rolled up to the
Baker Stadium in Melbourne to see Jerry Jerome
and Tim Land bash debbil-debbil out of each other
There is no more popular boxer in Australia to dav
than Jeremiah, the author of many lamentations
The prize was the middleweight championship of
Australia, and a stirring battle was expected. The
first disappointment came with the announcement
that Jeremiah was unable to make the weight—he
was 12oz. over—which, of course, deprived the fight
of the championship honors. The next was the
inability of Jeremiah to “go mad,” as he is always
expected to. Land steadily piled up points against
him, till, in the 15th round, he struck Jerry on the
summit of his head with a heavy right swing. As
something had to go, Land’s shoulder flew out of
joint, and he was unable r .o continue. Thus Jeremiah
won a battle which on points would certainly have
been a defeat. He will now meet Smith on a date
to be fixed by the angels who decide these matters.

The scrap between Burns and Stagg at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night was a battle in
which the issue was always in doubt. Never before
in this ring did the pendulum of victory swing so
erratically. Burns, who, in spite of his name, is a
son of Abraham, was list. 21b., while Stagg tipped
the beam at lOst. 91b. Both were exceedingly fast
and unusually clever with their fists. Stagg is pfo
bably the most finished boxer in Australia next to'
Wells, who excels him in defensive glove work. To
see Wells flick straight lefts aside is worth going far
to see, and it is also worth a long journey to observe
the way Stagg evades the fastest blows by simplv
shifting himself. It was a ferocious fight from the
jump. Both attacked the body with heavy swings;
and, although Stagg has not hitherto been regarded
as a heavy hitter, some of his wallops on Saturday
night were strong enough for anything. He is a
master of the sudden back-handed cut with either
hand, and over and over again he scored at close-
quarters with that curious blow. Burns’s condition
was not nearly so good as Stagg’s, but it was good
enough to enable him to put up a gruelling fight at
top speed. He was as fast on his feet as the elusive
Stagg, if not faster; but Stagg is a master of the
art of shifting his body with n jerk or a wriggle just
out of the line of the approaching fist.
In the second round, Burns tried Stagg’s back-
handed swing, caught his opponent over the left eye, and
sent him to the boards for five seconds. That knock-
down wallop shook Stagg badly, and it was not till
the end of the third round that he properly recovered
from it. In the seventh, Stagg made pretty play all
over the Hebrew, and in the next two rounds upper-
cut him so severely that in the ninth Burns was all
but out. Actually the gong saved him. The excite-
ment was terrific, and the crowd roared for the
Roman stroke. But Stagg seemed unable to deliver
it, although Burns was just tottering on his feet:
he must have received a heavy wallop in the wild
rally in which he eventually rocked Burns so badly.
Stagg eased up for a couple of rounds, then came
with another splendid burst in the 12th, and again it
looked as though a good punch would send Burns
out; but once more he weathered it and tottered to
his corner an apparent ruin. The way he recovered
during the minute spell was amazing; nevertheless
he continued to make heavy weather till the lotm
when he suddenly knocked Stagg down, rhe be
sounded only once before the latter was up agai
and dancing all over Burns, whom he hit and wa ■
loped as he pleased. It was a magnificent disp .
of speed and splendid hitting, and Burns looK ■
likely to collapse at any' moment. But a , wa -'A lv
recovered during the spells, and came out ga
to take the gruel Stagg ladled out so liberally.
In the 18th, the pendulum, which had been swing

BALLADE OF THE MACHINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hope is immortal, the fabulists say;
Certes, she need be to weather the knocks
Which have rained on her since that gloomy day
When she jumped out of Dame Pandora’s box !
Latter-day leagues of the “books” and the “jocks ”
Sorely assail her; they batten and bloat
On the red gold that Hope still loads on crocks—
Isn’t it time we demanded the Tote?
All round the year men are wending their way
Joyously raceward in confident flocks;
Fares, fees and charges they eagerly pay,
Keeping a feverish eye on the clocks.
One knows “a good thing” he’ll back to his socks ;
One has “a dead bird” concealed in his coat;
Each is convinced he’s a cunning old fox—
Isn’t it time we demanded the Tote?
Up from the Pit comes a horrible bray—
Brazen, dissonant—that threatens and mocks;
Lo! the poor victims the punters will flay—
Barvon the “wise ’uns” will shear of their locks !
Now for a slump in the Six-to-four Stocks !
Thirty-three starters —what odds do they quote?
‘'Evens the favorite”... .Beaten by blocks!....
Isn’t it time we demanded the Tote?
Envov.
Friends, let’s abolish this monster that shocks
Fair play and decency! Get out your vote!
Too many punters drift on to the rocks ;
Isn’t it time we demanded the Tote?

Sol Green, said to be Melbourne’s most
heavily gilded bookmaker nowadays, lays to
his job. IMreturned to this continent some
time ago after nine months’ absence. The
mailboat paddled him into Melbourne good
and early ; but instead of going home to see
how the missus and kids were getting along,
he bustled to his office, and didn’t leave
until he had done an ordinary day’s work —
and an ordinary day with Solomon means a
six o’clock knock-off.
“Amadoda” : Oh, how I do love these Wow-
ser countries, where the wicked cease from
troubling and the barmaids serve no more!
At the Auckland (M.L.) Criminal Sessions
this month there were three charges of car-
nally knowing, one of incest, one of rape, one
of abortion, two of indecent assault on
little girls, and one of unmentionable conduct
—nine horrors in a total of 22. Even Sydney
or Melbourne in the bad old days, with ffive
times the population, could hardly match this
uncleanliness.
For a country in its shirt sleeves, Aus-
tralia has a distressing crop of Baronets.
In addition to about a dozen resident in
or scampering through the Commonwealth,
the Tooths and the Heatons have lately
looked in. A couple of residents who own
the trophy decline, like Governor Read, of
Darlingliurst Gaol, to be seen out with it.
But in their case there is a suspicion that
all is not as it should be. Anyhow, Debrett
refuses to allow that they are genuine Barts.
In addition to Her ton and Tooth, N. S.
Wal.; is credited w Nicholson. Samuel
and Cooper, and with the rarely-heard-of
Broun. Victoria and South Australia have
two apiece—perhaps more —while Queens-
land and Westralia have each at least one
specimen.
Thus David G. Stead at a recent Sydney
Peace Society collogue :
I go in a good deal for bird-keeping, and since
the Balkan war I notice that the price of bird-seed
has gone up. Currants have also risen. Most of
those who grew these things are under the grass, and
the rest are not in a position to cultivate their land.
Now, if small countries like the Balkan States can
affect us in Australia, what would be the result of a
war between great Powers like England and Ger-
many ?
The obvious moral is, of course, that Aus-
tralia should get busy growing its own bird-
fodder and currants, and work overtime
manufacturing a large gun to shoo strange
birds away from the crops. But, presum-
ably, Mr. Stead, of the Anti-Defence Society,
didn’t mean it quite that way.
From “The Oldest Inhabitant”
Concerning ancient Tasmanian tombstones (B.
6/11/’l3). In the Cornelian Bay Cemetery near
Hobart is a very fine monument with the following
inscription:—
Erected by B. Molloy, Samuel and James Weir,
To the Memory of that Brave
but unfortunate Irishman,
MARTIN CASH,
who died 27th of August, 1878.
Aged 67 years.
R.I.P.
The memorial is a very fine stone cross. Cash was
a noted bus.iranger, who was transported for shoot-
ing at a man in Ireland in a fit of jealousy. He
was sent to Sydney for seven years, assigned to a
squatter up New England way, took French leave
and travelled with his “wife” across country to
Bathurst, put up for a time at the Dun Cow
(where he negotiated cheques he got from the sale
of “lifted” cattle), and worked his way down to
Sydney, after an encounter with a policeman on the
Cowpastures River. Things being too hot for him
in Sydney, he crossed to Tasmania, and being con-
victed —there is no doubt he was innocent that time
—got 12 months. Escaping, he took to the bush,
with varying fortune. He was on Norfolk Island
under John Price and at Port Arthur. His mates
were hanged, but he seemed to bear a charmed life.
On his release he settled dowm on a small farm at
Glenorchy, and ended a stormy life in a haven of
peace. Another interesting Tasmanian monument is
a headstone in a Hobart suburban cemetery, over
the ' very much neglected grave of George William
Evans, Deputy Surveyor-General of N. S. Wales,
who was deputed by Governor Macquarie to follow
up the tracks of Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson
over the Blue Mountains. He discovered the Mac-
quarie and Lachlan rivers, and named them, was the
first w'hite man to put foot on the site now occupied
by Bathurst, and gave his name to Evans’ Plains,
now' part of the Mount Pleasant estate, owned by
the Stew'arts. Shortly after his discovery of the
Lachlan and Macquarie he was appointed Deputy-
Surveyor in Van Diemen’s Land, and marked out
many of the streets of Hobart. After a trip to Eng-
- land, he set up as a bookseller, etc., in Bridge-
street, Sydney. In the first ’4o’s he returned to
V.D. Land, and died suddenly there in 1852. Evans
was a clever artist, and several of his water colors
of old Sydney are preserved.
“Billy Blue” : Apropos accidental tomb-
stones (B. G/11/T-3), the most remarkable
one ever stumbled on in Sydney was at the
top of Bridge-street, in front of the present
Government House gates. In June, 1847,
corporation laborers were breaking up the
surface of the street at that spot, when they
unearthed a stone lying on its face, with the
following inscription :
Sacred to the Memory of
JOHN HUNTER KENT,
Son of Lieutenant WILLIAM KENT, of the Navy,
And of
ELIZA, his Wife,
Born November Bth, 1795,
Died May 18th, 1796.
Greatly, lamented by his parents.
Lieutenant William Kent was the nephew of
Governor John Hunter, being the son of
Hunter’s eldest sister Mary. Kent came to
Sydney in command of the Supply, a tender
to 11.M.5. Reliance, which brought out
Hunter (1795). He speedily acquired pro-
perty through uncle’s favor, amongst it
an allotment on the N.E. corner of Bridge
and George streets, with a frontage of 250 ft.
to George-street and 340 ft. to Bridge-street.
Here he built a large house, which
Governor King afterwards purchased from
Kent for an orphan school. He also had
various grants of country land, in and
around where the present Carlingford rail-
way station now stands, totalling 1630 acres.
When his young son died in 1796 he and
his wife were living with their uncle (who
was a bachelor), in old Government House,
then situate about the corner of Bridge and
Phillip streets, and the little one was buried
in the garden attached. In a letter written
in 1807 by Surgeon John Harris to Mrs.
King, wife of ex-Governor King, he tells her
of the many offensive acts of Governor
Bligh, not the least of which was thht he
had demolished the marks of young Kent’s
grave in Government House grounds. The
overturned tombstone was, at any rate,
found out in the street. Kent —to finish him
off —was promoted to be captain of Q.M.S.
Buffalo, on the Australian station, was then
given command of Flinders’s historical old
ship Investigator, and died at sea off Toulon
while in command of the Union, 98 guns, on
August 29. 1812.

Secrets of Beauty.
SELECTED RECIPES FROM HERE
AND THERE—THINGS EVERY
WOMAN WANTS TO KNOW.
Getting Rid of
Female Moustaches.
“Practical Suggestions.”
To women who are annoyed by disfiguring downy
hair growths a method of permanently eradicating
the same will come as a niece of good news. Kor
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be used.
Almost any chemist should be able to supply an
ounce of this drug. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to remove the disfiguring growth
instantly, leaving no trace, but also to actually kill
the hair roots without irritating the skin. * * *
Objectionable body odors resulting from perspiration
and other causes may be instantly banished by
simply applying a little powdered (white) pergol to
the affected surface occasionally. * * * Smart
women are rapidly adopting the use of the natural
allaeite of orange blossoms when the complexion is
inclined to be oily. It makes a capital greaseless
cream, holds the powder perfectly, and does not
encourage hair growths.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
“Home Chemistry.”
Good stallax not only makes the best possible
shampoo, but has the. peculiar property of leaving
the hair with a pronounced natural “wave,” an
effect presumably desired by many ladies. A tea-
spoonful of the stallax granules, dissolved in a cup
of hot water is ample for a luxurious head wash,
and leaves the hair with a peculiar lustre and fluffi-
ness obtainable from nothing else as far as known.
It is perfectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been so little
used for this purpose it comes only in sealed original
packages, enough to make up twenty-five or thirty
individual shampoos. * * * For an actual hair
grower nothing equals pure boranium. It is quite
harmless, and sets the hair roots tingling with new
life. * * * The use of rouge is almost always
obvious, but powdered colliandum gives a perfectly
natural color and defies detection.
Oxygen Removes a
Bad Complexion.
“Practical Suggestions.”
Oxygen is now used to clear the complexion. Its
peculiar property of destroying waste matter and not
injuring healthy tissue is well known. Bad com-
plexions are merely the accumulation of half dead
waste matter on the skin surface. This accumulation
shows in the form of sallowness, moth patches and a
generally lifeless appearance. Smart women now
clear off these imperfections by getting some merco-
lized wax from the chemists and applying it for a
few nights like cold cream. This wax contains
oxygen, which attacks and removes the disfiguring
waste matter. It is pleasant to use and perfectly
harmless. The fresh, healthy skin which has been
covered up is soon revealed in all its beauty, and the
face so treated looks much younger and prettier as a
result. * * * To bring a natural red color
to the lips rub them with a soft stick of pro-
lactum. * * * For tired, hot or perspiring feet
use a teaspoonful of powdered onalite in a foot
bath.
Home Beauty Aids.
“Household Hints.”
A persistently shiny nose or a dull, lifeless com-
plexion drives many a woman to cosmetics and con-
sequent despair. And all the time a simple remedy
lies at hand in the home. If you have no cleminite
in the house you need only get about an ounce from
your chemist and add just sufficient water to dis-
solve it. A little of this simple lotion is Nature’s
own beautifier. It is very good for the skin, and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety, youth-
ful bloom that any woman might envy. It lasts all
day or evening, renders powdering entirely unneces-
sary, and absolutely defies detection. * * * To
make the eyelashes grow long, dark and curling,
apply a little mennaline with the finger tips occa-
sionally. It is absolutely harmless, and beautifies
the eyebrows as well. * * * Pilenta soap is the
most satisfactory for all complexions. It even works
well in cold or hard water.

Look for me in your storekeeper’s
window. You’ll recognise me at once
by my “ tailor-made ” appearance ;
my beautiful thin model watch
style case ; my big, frank, open face.
My bell isn’t alarming. It’s
cheerful, I wake you pleasantly —
like sunlight does in summer—even
on the darkest, coldest mornings.
I ring at intervals for 15 minutes
or steadily, as you choose.
And I wake you on time for I’m
watch-accurate as a timekeeper.
I’ve got a regular watch escahe-
ment —the mechanism upon which a
watch most depends for its time-
keeping qualities. You’ll notice that
I tick fast, evenly and lightly like a
watch instead of slowly and heavily
like common alarm clocks.
I must run like a watch at the
factory for six days and nights under
very careful inspection before they
let me come out to Australia.
I am seven inches tall, I’m mas-
sive, well poised and triple plated.
My face is frank, open, easy to
read —my keys large, strong, easy
to wind lam too alarms in one
—a 5 minute long alarm, and a 10
minute intermittent alarm.
I am made in La Salle, Illinois,
U.S.A., by Westclox. My price is

not find me in your town, s* nd

FOR XMAS GIFTS
Give “Swans” this Xmas and New Year—and indeed at any time
when occasion to give arises—because, if there is one thing likely to
be appreciated, used daily and valued by the recipient, it is a
“Swan.” The very fact of its being recognised as the best and
most reliable is alone a delicate compliment. It is useful on account
of its convenience, and absolutely reliable because of its always
being in perfect working order. It is an inexpensive gift, because
the initial cost is trivial compared with the satisfaction it gives. It
is a gift which will last for years.

“Umfaan”: In my opinion, the time has
come for Government action to prevent hus-
bands coming home at irregular hours. Hap-
hazardness is responsible for at least 95f
per cent, of the divorce work that keeps
judges and barristers, not to mention gents
one and “private enquiry agents,” in unpro-
ductive employment. William Henry's stupid
habit of returning at a time when Rupert is
either leaving or looking as if he wished he
had left, makes all the bother. In 19 cases
out of 20 wives tire of the lodger if given
sufficient freedom to partake of his caresses.
If they don’t then lie will, and the result is
always a more enthusiastic care for the old
original—as a sop, perhaps, to the feminine
conscience. Therefore, I say, compel hus-
bands to keep regular hours, and make them
post the time-table in the hall.
John Maori has at last handed his calum-
niators the reproof they have long called ten-
ders for. The son of the soil is continually
being gibed at as a spendthrift who wastes
his money on billiards, totalisators and joy-
times generally, instead of being saving, in-
dustrious and simple-living like his white
brother. The other week a North Island
paper bewailed the fact that a well-known
local Maori had spent £6OO on a motor-car
instead of using the money to improve “the
conditions under which he lived.” Where-
upon Rangi to the editor:—
It gets on my nerves to hear the people talk
“Rangi will soon bust,” etc. If that prediction
comes true, I am quite content to go to work ; but I
beg to state that I could buy the Herald [the
offending paper] lock, stock and barrel as far as
money is concerned. I don’t think it is fair for my
colonial friend to advertise me without authority
when he dare not do it about his pakeha friends.
It may be he has made a mistake, to which any man
is liable; if so, I will forgive him. If it is not a
mistake, then I can only put it down to ignorance.
After which the editor no doubt felt that ho
had been trodden on by a steam roller.
“T. 0.1.”: Ex-Police Superintendent Sad-
lier, of Victoria, in a book of recollections
recently published, speaks of the robbery Qf
the Mclvor escort and of the three men
executed for it. One of these, Mr. Sadlier
says, was known as “Captain” Melville. The
ex-Super. is wrong. “Captain” Melville was
another man, who was concerned in an
attempted escape from the hulks about six
months prior to the murder of John Price.
A bo man named Owens was killed in that
scuffle. Melville was, with others, tried and
condemned, but a technical point saved his
life. Apparently,. however, he didn’t want
it, for he suicided in gaol shortly afterwards.
Mr. Sadlier states there are but three mem-
bers of the Cadet Corps of £852 alive —John
H. Lydiard, Reginald Green and John Sad-
lier. There is one in Sydney who joined
early in 1853—E. W. Fosbery, for many
years Commissioner of Police in N. S.
Wales, and now, after retirement from the
force, an M.L.C.
Henry Tudor Shadforth was the first
Sergeant-at-Arms in the first N.S.W. Parlia-
ment under responsible government, and
afterwards was made Usher of the Black
Rod on the death of Major Lockyer. His
father, Colonel Thomas Shadforth, served in
the Peninsular War, and commanded his
regiment (the 57th) in N. S. Wales in the
’2o’s. On the 57th being ordered to India,
Shadforth sold out, remained in the colony
and proved a useful citizen. He was for
some years hon. sec. to the Dispensary and
the Australian Library (1833 to 1845), was
a trustee of the Savings Bank and one of
the directors of the unfortunate Bank of
Australia. He had a pastoral property •
called Ravenswood on the Nepean River at
the back of Mulgoa. Besides the black-rod
son the old Colonel had another, Richard W.,
who was the first Associate to Alfred Ste-
phen, and afterwards in Melbourne was
Associate to Therry and a’Beckett. In later
years he was P.M. at Kynetort. Ex-Justice
Matthew Henry Stephen’s wife was a
daughter of Henry Tudor Shadforth: they
were married as far back as September 30,
1854.
The sites for Sydney’s two ancient taber-
nacles, St. James’s Church of England and
St. Mary’s R.C. Cathedral, were both se-
lected because they were very handy to the
convicts’ barracks. The St. James’s site had
been intended for another purpose alto-
gether ; but it turned out this way: Mac-
quarie had opened the old Hyde Park bar-
racks for the housing of the working gangs
in 1819. That same year, when Commis-
sioner Bigge arrived, armed with plenary
powers, he found that the convicts were
marched over to St. Philip’s every Sunday.
Taking strong exception to this, he directed
that the building then being erected at the
top of King-street for a court-house should
be altered into a church. This was done,
and that is how Sydney got St. James’s.
As soon as a roof could be put over it, the
convicts were taken there; the first service
was held on January 6, 1822, convicts form-
ing the congregation. On May 3, 1820,
Fathers Conolly and Therry arrived, and as
most of their congregation were also con-
victs, the present site of St. Mary’s was
chosen, for the same reason as in the other
case.
“Gadsby”: The case was looking very
black against the prisoner when the Crown
case closed. Then a witness called for the
defence turned the scale by denying every-
thing the Crown witnesses had asserted, and
asserting everything they had denied. The
Crown Prosecutor was getting more and more
annoyed as his cross-examination proceeded.
At last there was nothing for it but to
show that the witness was of so bad a char-
acter that he couldn’t be believed on oath.
“Were you not on the 16th of June, 1898,
convicted of he asked. After
some hesitation the witness said “I was.”
“And on the 10th of February, 1901, weren’t
you charged and convicted of perjury?”
Again the witness admitted the trifle.
Then counsel for the prisoner, who was very
young, arose to re-examine and 1 set things
right. “Now, Mr. Blank, you’ve been asked
about these convictions; but were you not,
on the 4th May, 1906, charged with larceny
and acquitted ?” “I was,” replied the wit-
ness proudly. “And on the 16th August.
1910, for robbery in company?” “I was.”
“And acquitted?” “Yes.” And have you
not been tried for many other offences and
acquitted?” “Certainly,” replied the wit-
ness, and left the box feeling that his char-
acter had been thoroughly rehabilitated.
Yet, somehow, the prisoner got 12 months’
hard. < '« ‘ a,/*

more pleasure than many a more costly
present. Onotos may be had in more ex-
pensive forms, but it is the case that is
different, the pen itself is always the same,
always perfect, the cheapest as the dearest.
It starts writing at once and goes on writing
all the time with never a halt. And the
ink comes out of one spot only , at the end
of the nib —and only in the act of Writing.
You cannot give a more useful, charm-
ing and efficient present. —Yes.

STOMACH TROUBLES DUE TO
ACIDITY.
SO SAYS EMINENT SPECIALIST.
So-called stomach troubles, such as indi-
gestion, wind, stomach-ache and inability to
retain food, instead of indicating that tnc
stomach is out of order, are in nine cases
out of ten simply evidence that fermentation
is taking place in the food contents ot t
stomach, causing the formation of gas an
acids. Wind distends the stomach, ana
causes that full, oppressive feeling SOD .,
times known as heartburn, while the a
irritates and inflames the delicate lining »
the stomach. The stomach, however, is n
at fault. The trouble lies entirely m
f rmenting food. Such fermentation is
natural, and acid formation is not onii
natural, but may involve the most serio -
consequences if not prevented. To P ie *
or stop ferjnentation of the food contents
the stomach and to neutralise the acid, a
render it bland and harmless, halt a *
spoonful of bisura ted magnesia, probably
best and most effective antacid kn •
should be taken in a quarter of a S la .
hot or cold water immediately after cans-
or whenever wind or acidity is ten.
stops the fermentation, and neutralise
acidity in a few moments. Fermentation,
wind and acidity are dangerous and tin f
sary. Stop or prevent them by the m. •
a proper antacid, such as. bisurated „ n v
nesia. which can be obtained irom •
chemist, and thus enable the stomach o
its work properly without being ninoe p $
poisonous gas and dangerous acids. - •.
IN BANANA LAND.
The old Australian Potash Co. has handed
all its concessions, patents, etc., to a new
co. —-Cactus, Ltd. —which is backing up
Roberts in his campaign against prickly-
pear. By March next the experiments will
be so far advanced that Queensland will be
able to wave its hat, or renew its curses.
The Sugar Superintendent reports that
this season’s cane crop will touch 1,994,000
tons, as against 1,840,000 tons in the record
year of 1910. For an industry that was
first shot dead by the withdrawal of colored
labor and then strangled by the extortionate
demands of the white workers, it is not
doing half-badly.
From “McNorth,” who perches on the
reak of the map :
There’s going to be some fun on Cape York Pen-
insula when the Government starts to yard up the
Binghis for the purpose of placing them in settle-
ment stations. Binghi strongly objects to confine-
ment of any kind, and has emphatically stated his
intention of giving the Government a run for it.
If he does, it’s likely to be a stern chase, as the
nigs in the police employ are in sympathy with their
brethren, and will systematically present a blank
expression when asked to find tracks. They wouldn’t
mipd so much if it wasn’t proposed to deport them
to an island ; but to a mainland savage that is the
last straw.
Bananaland’s police are being poked into
activity over a cargo-pilfering epidemic. A
deputation has just told Attorney-General
Sullivan that over £300,000 worth of goods
are stolen from Queensland wharves and
boats annually, and though shippers didn’t
mind losing a tin of sardines or an anchor
occasionallY-they thought £300,000 was a bit
over the odds. Sullivan seemed to think so
too, and therefore appealed to Police Com-
missioner Cahill, at the same time passing a
hint to all coastal P.M.’s to give pilferers,
when caught, something with fried lead in it.
It is a dry measure out of which the man
who lives by business, robbery, etc., can’t
squeeze a little profit. Queensland lately
passed a Pure Seeds Bill —a very desirable
thing, in view, for example, of the large
quantities of valueless Japanese rape-seed
which mysteriously fall into consignments of
Essex rape-seed. The new law lays it down
that the seed must be free from noxious
vegetables, and also be capable of doing its
job, which is the production of a crop. The
farmer reckoned that all this was for his
protection; but now, when he lands into the
city or the township with his sample of
(say) extra-prime seed wheat, worth ss. a
bushel of any seedsman's money, he is met
blandly with the remark that it is very fine
stuff, no doubt; but will the farmer give the
seedsman a guarantee that he will pay the
fines and the bill for damages in case the
stuff isn’t free from noxious seeds? Of
course the farmer is scared off, and sadly
passes on the seed at miller’s price—3s. 6d.
or thereabouts. Whereupon the seedsman
prepares to retail it as prime seed and scoops
the extra eighteenpence a bushel.
RESURRECTING THE FAMILY SKELETON.
DE POTTS POINT: “ Yes, dear boy, we have a beautiful harbor. All my people love it.
When my dear old grandfather first saw it he was transported with delight."
ABSENT-MINDED FRIEND: “Yes, I know how the old man got here—but I never heard
the name of his accomplice before. ”
Bananaland is back to dry times again.
Geraldton, where they measure the rainfall
by the yard, is actually short of water —a
thing previously unknown for 25 years—and
in Rockhampton and Gympie they are
peddling the stuff as if it were milk. In
Brisbane, however, water is still plentiful,
and is used for adulteration with the old
energy and success.
“Rangan” : It is looked on as a sure thing
that Denham’s locum tenens will lead the
Liberal party next year. Twice during the
present year pressure was unsuccessfully
brought on Denham to force him down, not
that he is regarded as incompetent, but
simply that his time has come, and a change
is wanted. At time of writing Blair easily
leads the field for the acting-Premiership"
with Barnes a good second.
“Gouger”: The Cairns wharf-lumpers
have resolved not to handle produce grown
by Chinese, and the cockies on the Atherton
tablelands, who are incessantly shrieking
that they cannot compete against Chinese,
are rejoicing accordingly. Old hands, how-
ever, reckon it will be a matter of years
before the swarm of Chows are rooted out
from the righ lands stretching from Cairns
to away beyond Atherton. Under law a
Chinaman may not hold these lands, but if a
cocky is too tired to till his own soil, there
is nothing to stop him letting his humpy
(not his land) to a Chow for (say) 80
pounds a year. If a cocky has 80 acres of
land, he therefore averages a pound an acre
rent. Of course the cocky won’t admit that.
He will say the Chow is working for him.
And that’s the stiff proposition the "white”
wharfies are up against—worse luck !
More White Australia, this time in the
advertising columns of a paper printed in
an allegedly Labor city :—-
For Sale.—A grocery business. Good opportunity
for energetic person. Good connection. —Harry Lee
Ping.
“Good connection!” And, no doubt, quite
true, too.
A curse from the West: —
I want to throw a plug of dynamite at the Queens-
land Education Department. The Mitchell State
school was one of the first buildings erected in the
neighborhood, and on account of its utter depravity
was condemned two years ago. About two months
ago it was considered so absolutely dangerous that
the children were drafted into the sheds, where
young Australia has ever since been slowly roasted.
On December 3 the thermometer in one of these
huts registered 114 deg. Rain water is “off,” like
turkey at the fourpenny restaurant, and the young-
sters have to quench their thirst with bore water.
The fence round the grounds has been drawing the
old age pension for years. During cyclonic disturb-
ances the old structure rattles like, I remember, the
Surry Hills ’bus used to on the blocks. On October
10 the Department intimated its intention of build-
ing a new school to cost £1250, but since then it
has simply backed and filled. Surely to Heaven the
people who are doing the pioneering in the sun-
scorched West are entitled to a little consideration !
Digby Denham, finding himself in a tight
place, has passed on the responsibility of
appointing a locum tenens to the members
of the Liberal party in Parliament. Ballot
papers have been sent out and are return-
able on December 12. It is really a contest
between Jimmy Blair and "Bishop” Barnes.
The importance of the job during the
absence of the butter-man is now heightened
by the prospects of an appeal to the Federal
polls before next April, for the party wants
someone who can take the platform, since
it is recognised that a Federal fight would
largely affect the Queensland State elec-
tions. Blair is a much better platform man
than Barnes ; his only trouble is that he has
often of late exhibited the tired feeling.
Barnes is windy enough, but his say is
mostly composed of chaff, which is lost in
the applause the chairman gets for presiding
at the meeting.
“Rangan”: The other morning one of
Bananaland’s seaside resorts woke up a
little less drowsy than usual, and wondered
what a certain small, dilapidated hut in a
prominent position was built for. Whatever
it was, it was in such a bad state that the
owner should be made to shift it. After
much fruitless inquiry the oldest inhabitant
was hunted up, and he, on mature considera-
tion, decided that the building was the
School of Arts. Nobody seemed to know
anything beyond that, until an ancient salt-
encrusted wanderer recalled dimly that he
was once the secretary and that the key was
under the steps. A search for the key was
successful, and the building was aired. The
township then covered itself with remorse.
It was a shame, a scandal, a public dis-
grace, and the publican and the grocer
formed themselves into a new committee,
ordered a dozen books and four pots of
paint;" and appointed a new secretary. So
for a few months the papers will be read ;
then the membership will drop off, and the
new secretary will one day lock the door and
leave the key under the steps and forget it.
It’s the way of Queensland’s seaside places.
Bill an' Me.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were sawing a log, was Bill an’ me
(They called him Bill, but his name was
Jim),
An’ the timber it wasn’t working free.. . .
"To Hell with the stuff,” says I to him.
’Twas a blackbutt log with a two-foot pipe ;
The crosscut jammed, an’ it jammed, an’
jammed ;
An’ I says to Bill, as I stopped to wipe
The sweat off my brow: “Well, I’ll be
damned.”
We were sleeper-getters on Mount Gnaree
(Of the hogback sort, at eight pun ten,
An’ with ten bob off for the royalty),
Till at last the saw stuck tight, an’ then
Says William: “Why, shiver me blinded
soul,
There’s something holding the blessed
teeth.
The thing is to get right up in the hole
An’ free the beggar from underneath.”
He says: “I will crawl away up inside
An’ pick the splinters out of her. See?”
So into the pipe that was two foot wide
He wriggles himself accordingly.
I waited an’ waited for him until
The sun went over the ranges’ rim;
An’ feelin’ something had happened to Bill,
I cut a sapling an 7 probed for him.
I got the feel of him, too, first rate,
An’ heard him yellin’: “The saw is free;
But I can’t git back to save me, mate;
The splinters has got me skewered, ye see.
“You’ve got for to get me outer this bog
Somehow,” he says, “on your own. me
friend.
The thing for to do is to saw the log,
An’ I’ll git out when you cuts an end.”
So I loosens the saw, an’ I cuts her through,
An’ a lever gets to roll her clear;
When she makes a break, an’ away she flew
A-down the side of the mountain sheer.
She was round as a ball, with never a lump.
An ’a slippery, greasy log she were;
An’ whenever she’d strike a rock she’d jump
For fifty feet in the bloomin’ air.
The mountain it dropped for a thousand feet.
An’ she crashed an’ smashed the whole way
down.
“That poor old William,” I said, “is meat” ;
So I struck straight out for the pub in
town.
I said : “I will drink to my old mate here 1 —
My dead old mate” ; but my heart stood
still.
For. breasting the bar, and full of beer.
Was Jim, the man we described as Bill.

The Queensland Trotting Club concluded
its summer revival at Ascot to-day. Th e
repentance stool at the foot of the totali-
zator was, as usual, well patronised
Amongst the elect were Mrs. Jack Mowbray
Thomson in a gown of white ninon over
lace, her headpiece being a small black hat
or its equivalent supplemented with an emer-
ald ribbon. Irene Browne, in a simple cream
silk frock and a black tulle halo, succeeded
in convincing the congregation that her
style of frocking is a virtue to be imitated
Other frockers whose names should be
hoisted on the glory board included Mrs.
E. G. Blume (whose husband owns Lady
Medallist, my dear —this, of course, be-
tween ourselves) and Mrs. H. C. Mustard,
who leaves to-morrow with her newly-
annexed husband to finish the honeymoon
in Maoriland. The Cecil Palmer and the
Ned Tully dames, likewise Mrs. Ted Hol-
land. need hardly be mentioned. Their
frocking is a thing of duty and a joy for
ever.
The Young YVimmen’s Liberal Club is
still under the spotlight, and this afternoon
was posed aboard the Lucinda. K. Grant
and R. Trout did the flattering for the male
section of Digby Denham’s political con-
spirators, and if there had been a general
election handy they couldn’t have done it
with more energy.
The Ladies’ Rowing Club held a regatta
this afternoon on the Customs House reach
of the river. A fair number of admiring
cousins and aunts of the rowers showed up,
as well as a small sprinkling of male ad-
mirers. The glad remarks of the last-men-
tioned would run into a column, and I’m
not sure that the boys would like to see
them all in print.
Fresh from her Northern . trip, Amy
Murphy wandered around this dust-blinded
city for a few days this week. In the inter-
vals of sipping iced drinks, ehc unburdened
herself of some appreciative remarks con-
cerning the kindness of the inhabitants of
Townsville and Charters Towers. The glad
hand was stretched out with such vigor that
the Songbird still feels the glad tingle of the
North. Amy’s impressions of Charters
Towers are written mainly in M’s —Money.
Music and Motoring.
The annual epidemic of students’ recitals
has broken out very seriously this year-end.
Maibry Campbell’s pupils held the platform
(or as much of it as they could) last Wednes-
day night, and to-night, at the Pianola Hall,
Lena Hammond will show the results of her
teaching; also, violinist Vada Jeffries and
’cellist Mary Jeffries will put their pupils
through their musical paces at the School of
Arts Hall. For next week, one thousand
and ninety-nine schools, more or less, show
symptoms of being infected.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
In order to transform Brisbane, Rock-
hampton and Townsville into passable ports
it has been necessary to spend on them re-
spectively £415,000, £305,000 and £298,000,
or about a million in all. These figures
must bring great comfort to the strangled
natural harbors of Gladstone and Bowen,
especially now that Mackay is getting
£370,000 in order to remove any rankling
sense of injustice.

Taunch: Information passed on to where
it is likely to do more good than would result from
publishing it.... Arthur Rae: Glad to hear that your
old opponent, Tom Fitzpatrick, isn’t dead, and hereby
dig him up. He called last week, and was the most
cheerful corpse this paper has met. His one griev-
ance was that Tub B. had robbed him of a year or
two; he is now 79... .Ancient Mariner: Faint,
smudged inkstains, no doubt very interesting, but in
parts quite undecipherable.... Matteo: Pretty good,
but subject scarcely worth the space. Keep going.
....Fencer: Stick to post-h01e5.... Glad Idler: They
were reckoned very good yarns when they were told
one wet night in the Ark... .Stumped: Best plan for
burning out stumps? Don’t know —unless you set
them on fire... .Bull Ant: Badly put.... A Border:
Done to death; try something else... .Crystal: The
extract is as big and dreary as a scrub lease; and
the matter has no point without it.... G.V.W.:
Thanks for clippings of matter stolen from Ihb
Bulletin by the Christchurch Star. That s the
second thief we’ve met this week; the other one
lifted the Religious Editor’s change (9d.) from the
bar-counter in the Honest Irishman. . . .W.H.D.:
Good story; it always was.... Kola: The omce
microscope magnifies only 72 times, so we couldn t
read your interesting remarks. .. .M.J.M.: Thanks
very much. Didn’t the man who wrote it tack it on
to Rubinstein ?... .J.W.G.: The long narrative poem
beginning “To all great .achers of morality has
been rejected. Such things are too spacious for a
modern weekly newspaper. .. .A.T.8.: It’s no use
composing these songs for print... .The average
reader refuses to sing his paper.... Acorn : The sturdy
oak of literature will not spring out of y0u....0.M.
(M.L.) : Chirp-chirp-chirp! Cool and pleasant love-
twitter, but quite unsuitable. .. .J.L.B. (V.): It is
a good theme, and you approach it in the right way,
but the total result is uneven. . . .M.lv. (V.) : Sketchy,
unoriginal verse... .J.H.F.: Dull verse about a per-
son of no overwhelming importance. .. .J.L.8.: Ram
song is just monotonous... .G. 8.: It rhymes fairly
well, but you don’t make any original observations.
C.R.B.: Not for print Riah: Pure stodge.
N.S.N.: What is the lowest figure at which you
will agree to stop writing?....F.S.McD.: Read with
yawns.... Climax: Try one of the other weeklies.
.. . . W.L.D.: tfo more songs, for Heaven’s sake !... .
Boy: Sweet, but valueless. .. .Wm. M. (Vancouver,
8.C.) : No use Bill’s Girl: It was duly fired
E.H. : Flynn is 10 or 15 years too late. . . . R.R.R. :
Basket. .. .A.T.Q.: It’s wearisome jingle. .. .Native
Bear: Not worth a withered gumleaf. . . .H.F.C.
(Sydney) : Allegory faints on the road to acceptance
through lack of proper nourishment. .. .John G.:
Declined.... Separated : Sorry no place for it... . Hal
T.: Verse full of good intentions. .. .Alfred U. (Ade-
laide) : Your world-wide experience of the subject
should enable you to do something better....B. Sass
(England): Dull product G.G.: Thanks; but we
can’t put so much marmalade on our own bread and
butter Lillie: Perhaps it isn’t so preposterous
as it looks. It is quite possible for no-license
in M.L. to increase the consumption of liquor and
still throw men out of a job. When the hog drinks
out of a trough, it doesn’t need many barmen to
fill him un... .F.M.S.: The chairman picked an
insect off the candidate’s coat. A quarter of a
column. Thank Heaven, it wasn’t a hive of bees....
Industrialist (M.L.) : All been explained before
Douglas T.: Uninteresting enough to be true....
Bullinbah: Not up. . . .Silver Morn: For the 150,000 th
time you (all of you) can only know that pars have
been accepted by seeing them in print. Then you
can bet on it Old Age: American reprints appar-
ently. No market for them here. ... J.G.W.: Thanks.
What fine, picturesque phrases some
prospectors think up as they toil through the
lonely places! Naturalist Meek, back lately
from German New Guinea, tells of meeting
one or two of a party of three of the best-
known Papuan prospectors, who had been
lured over the border by talesxof gold. The
expedition was a frost, so the party turned
to shooting birds of Paradise. (The Ger-
man New .Guinea Government, by the way,
allows this, on a royalty basis.) “How
d’you find the natives?” asked Meek, con-
cerning a district that hadn’t too good a
name. “Pretty bad,” said the Old Hand.
“Had to trade a lot of bullets for arrows !”
Dr. Pomare, the somewhat excitable Min-
ister representing the native race in Massey’s
Maoriland Cabinet, is a fine speaker with a
caustic wit, reminiscent of the Napoleonic
Te Ratiparaha, with whom he claims rela-
tionship on the maternal side. At a dinner
given some time ago to a few illustrious
globe-trotters, the Doctor flabbergasted his
hearers by declaring that he had Scotch
blood in-his veins. His naive explanation
was that the Caledonian extract was due to
the fact that on one occasion, at a remote
period, an ancestor had taken part in a
banquet where the piece de resistance was a
Scotch engineer.
“Bloore” : In spite of Acts governing the
“adoption” of children, the horrible business
of baby farming still flourishes in N. S.
Wales. The “Miscellaneous” column of the
“largest circulation” is the same old collec-
tion of “kind ladies” wanting to “adopt,”
with addresses at suburban post-offices. The
Children’s Protection Act is so full of holes
that the “not wanted” infant is frequently
pushed through it, and is then immediately
lost to sight. The Act provides that no
person may adopt any child on a cash-down
basis. For instance, Mrs. Snappit receives
an offer of £25 cash to adopt Sarah Jane’s
child for life. The Act says Mrs. S. cannot
do this, but makes the asinine proviso that
she may accept payments not exceeding £1
weekly. As this makes little difference to
the benevolent lady’s schemes, she is de-
lighted to accept one sovereign a week for
25 weeks; and at the end of that period
the State’s supervision and interest in the
much-desired young Australian ceases. Mean-
time Sarah Jane may have gone to Bagdad
or Booleroo ; whereupon the child is liable to
contract gastro-meningitis or some other
“itis” and become a “bud in HeaVen. Even
if the child survives, there’s nothing to pre-
vent Snappit from leaving the infant in the
Town Hall gallery or on some persons
doorstep, to again come under State control,
but at the taxpayers’ expense this time.
The most callous and inhuman person con-
nected with the whole sordid business is the
uncertificated female who hangs out a brass
plate inscribed “Nurse Bones.” Nurse Bones
not only undertakes to accouche Sarah Jane,
but will for (say) 15s. per week “care for”
the child. Of course, she picks her marks,
and prefers the girl who wishes to get away
from the distressing surroundings in which
her indiscretion has placed her. Very well;
the girl away, “Nurse” promptly farms the
infant to someone else at 10s. per week, re
taining the other ss. for her own little sock.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any 0 f our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.

It has a hogskin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
lung flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro
tecting its interior from , the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of Tub

leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight 'mid. It is to lie obtained

The Great Taxgatherer made a sudden
and unexpected call on L. S. Spiller, Chief
Commissioner of Taxation in N.S.W., on
December 4. In 1895, when N.S.W. first
imposed the income tax, Spiller, who was
Deputy-Commissioner of Taxes in S. Aus.,
was selected as one of the three new Com-
missioners in the Ma State. When the
land tax went and the incidence of the
income tax was raised from £3OO to its
present figure, the Income Tax Department
was forced into reconstruction, and Spiller
was appointed First Commissioner. Ilis
job is one that every public servant of stand-
ing thinks would suit him admirably, and a
rush for the billet has already set in.
During the last few years experiments
have proved the enormous value of super-
phosphates in increasing the grape crop in
S. Aus., and the growers’ pockets have
benefited accordingly. Now the growers
find that, if they could only get Japanese
and other foreign artificial manures in free,
they could buy them a bit cheaper that the
Australian phosphate cos.’ goods are offered
at; so an agitation has been started to gee
the Commonwealth to abolish the duty “in
the interests of a primary industry.” The
chilled cheek of the proceeding lies in
the fact that the wine-growing industry on
which the agitators have built up their
lucrative business was nurtured under Pro-
tection, and any proposal to abolish the
wine duties would still be met with a howl
that would shrivel every vine-leaf within
miles.
Consider the snuffiesome hypocrisy of
the Argus, priding itself on having for two
years battled for good roads for the far-east
Gippsland settler—the pioneer who gets
away back through miles of forest to where
a bit of good land may be had at a reason-
able price. The Main Roads Commission
found him there to-day—along the 80 miles
between Orbost and Genoa, around Murrun-
gowar, at Club Terrace and Combienbar —•
growing maize and raising pigs, driving his
produce over 100 and 130 miles of track to
a station, and “packing” his supplies back.
The Argus pats him on the shoulder and says
he is a “sturdy backbone” and congratulates
him on having at last got his decent road.
And yet, if the equally good if not richer
provinces lying west from Melbourne, away
to the South Australian border, had not been
kept locked up by the Argus’s friends, the
land monopolists, the pioneers would have
settled thereon, and few of them would have
been farther than 10 miles from a railway
station.
When the Federal Labor Party wants to
hit Cook in the vitals, it does not now use
the weapon of the adjournment of the House,
which begins and ends with hot air. It
uses its majority in the Senate to appoint
Select Committees. These are clothed with
all the powers that the Senate can endow
such bodies with, and are only stopped from
examining members of the House of Reps,
when the latter Chamber refuses permission
for them to attend. Thus only did Joseph
himself escape the ordeal of the grid for
things he said about electoral adminis-
tration. The Elections Committee com l
nelled McColl, being a Senator, to turn up
to prove or deny or explain his charges of
roll-stuffing on oath. Next, Millen, also a
member of the House controlled by Labor,
is to toe the mark; and there are penalties
for witnesses who refuse to answer ques-
tions. Already the Fitzroy Dock Committee
has reported that the circumstances did not
warrant the action of Joseph’s Government
in partially closing down the works; and
though nobody may take any notice of what
the Chinn Committee says, the Elections
Committee promises an interesting chapter in
the Book of Castigations.


Suffered Six Months. Used Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. Rash
Gone. They Also Healed Two
Boils on Neck, and Abscess.
Amyville,” Castlereagh St., Singleton,
N. S. W. —“I unfortunately contracted the
barber’s rash, which had spread all over my
face, and I suffered through this for about
six months. J was Recommended by a
friend to try the Cuticura Remedies, which
I did with good results. J used Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment as directed,
and in about twq or- three weeks the rash
was gone. I triect other remedies before but
was unsuccessful with them all.
“ I bad two boils on my neck and I used
the Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment
on them. I also had an abscess which had
given me great suffering for a week, and
after using the Cuticura Remedies for two
or three days it broke and healed up well
after.” (Signed) A. E. Stewart, October,
1912.
FOR PIMPLES AND BLACKHEADS
The following is a most effective and eco-
nomical treatment: Gently smear the af-
fected parts with Cuticura Ointment, on the
end of the finger, but do not rub. Wash off
the Cuticura Ointment in five minutes with
Cuticura Soap and hot water and continue
bathing for some minutes. This treatment
is best on rising and retiring. At other times
use Cuticura Soap freely for the toilet and
bath, to assist in preventing inflammation,
irritation and clogging of the pores, a com-
mon cause of these distressing eruptions.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment are
sold throughout the world. Liberal sample
of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

AN INTERESTING
EXPERIMENT.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey Hairs
make, just lay a piece of paper ov<?r each of the two
halves of the above portrait. The Grey “half” will
then be seen to have the appearance of 45 years of
age, whereas the other half looks only 30. Dr. B.
Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut Stain will make
all those years of difference if you are grey or prema-
turely grey. It is perfectly harmless, easy to apply,
and will quickly restore the Hair to the natural shade
of youth, or younger years.

“Bucolic”: Every observant traveller in Australia,
especially N. S. Wales, is satisfied that the crops
of wheat are not half what they ought to be. Indeed
our statistics, compared with those of intensely-culti-
vated regions, prove it. America thinks the same
thing of its territory ; hence the National Soil Fer-
tility League has been established with a claim that
it is going to make lots of land twice as productive.
Subsidised agricultural schools have proved that
soil which averages 14 bushels of wheat to the acre
can produce 30. President Woodrow Wilson flings
himself heartily in with the league. Says he: “You
must transfer demonstration from schools to farms.”
That is being done. Congress will devote £2,000,000
sterling a year for 3000 agricultural experts in the
3000 agricultural counties. They are farmers who
have graduated In agricultural colleges; they will
get from £400 to £800 a year each, and their ser-
vices will go to the farmers for nothing. One county
in Illinois did not wait for the Congress expert.
The farmers subscribed £3000, and engaged Pro-
fessor Eckhardt, of Illinois University, for three
years. The first year’s experiment proves that the
corn average on a majority of 1000 farms was in-
creased by 10 bushels an acre, adding £100,000 to
to the cash value of the crop, and greatly enhancing
land values. Six other countries are following this
example.
“Fax”: Re unclaimed deposits in Savings Banks.
A couple of weeks ago I was shifting myself from a
N.S.W. country town to Vic., and, wanting my few
bob for the journey, went to the local branch of the
Commonwealth Savings Bank to close my account.
I was there informed by a courteous but immovable
official that I could not close the account, but “must
leave at least a shilling on deposit.” He could find
no regulation giving this decision, but was adamant
on the point; so I left my bob behind me. Now I
badly want to know why, in the height of an Aus-
tralian summer, I should have to present the Com-
monwealth Bank with half a gallon of beer. P.S. —
I could do with it myself at this moment.
“Mayne Stay”: Re remark by some untechnical

more usual derrick —is one of the many worries of the
mate. He is responsible in the owner’s eyes. As
the owner is responsible for any accident, unless in-
sured, he generally makes severe remarks to the
mate, and, incidentally, to the skipper for not look-
ing after the mate, when he has to pay for damage.
The mate and the captain would both, therefore,
be glad of some system of testing, as iron gets a
tired feeling sometimes without showing any external
symptoms. Meanwhile they do the best they can by
keeping a bit up their sleeve, as in the case men-
tioned, when a 15-ton crane (only it wasn’t a crane)
was put to do an lift. It was a crystallised
pin that lost its grip in that ease. In the other one
mentioned in thqt par. a winch came out of gear.
A test might have discovered the crystallisation; the
other mishap was pure accident.
“Diorite” : Westrafia is said to be a great agricul-
tural State, and some political leaders affirm that
the place is free from commercial combines. Just
now at Kalgoorlie the cost of living is lower than it
has been for months, yet here are some prices at
retail stores: Meat, 8d. to Is. per lb. ; potatoes
(largely imported), £14 a ton; butter (all im-
ported, poor quality and adulterated), Is. 5d. lb. ;
bread, 5d. the 21b. loaf; eggs, risky imported ones,
Is. 6d. doz. ; bacon, imported, Is. 3d. Nightly God-
fearing Gropers pray that there won’t be a maritime
strike in the Eastern States lest the butter, egg and
bacon supply be cut off. Meantime, Bill Mainshaft
pours profanity on Bigjohn Forrest and Jack Scad-
dan, both of whom claim to have made the State
God’s own country.

A woman charged in a Sydney court the other
day with defrauding the railways by travelling with-
out a ticket protested her innocence, and warned the
magistrate that if convicted she would go to gaol.
She was a pleasant-looking woman, but free travellers
run in all shapes, and it was hard to see what the
Bench could do but convict. It first suggested, how-
ever, that she should search her bag once more. The
lady dived into the receptacle, drew out a bank-book,
two handkerchiefs, three bunches of letters, two
photographs, a laundry bill and a few other things,
and shook the bag upside down vigorously. As she
replaced the things the ticket dropped out of the
bank-book, and all was peace. Anyone who has the
welfare of woman at heart might do the sex, and
the State, a great service by designing a pocket that
will only admit a railway ticket or a tram-fare.
Ordinary handbags are always stuffed so full of rub-
bish that, once the ticket or the tram-fare gets right
inside, it becomes as elusive as a needle in a stack.
It gives the woman trouble, but it costs the taxpayer
money, because while the mislaid ticket or fare
is being found six people get off without paying
anything. « * .
Estates Control, Ltd., an English concern which
owns most of the shares in the Bovril estates in
Australia and Argentine, has just issued its yearly
accounts. A net profit was shown for the 12 months
of £34,567, which was an increase of £22,891 on
the previous year, and dividends of 54 per cent, on
preference shares and S000 per cent, on ordinaries
were paid. So disgusted is the co. with its return
that it has decided to make some money. So it is
subscribing for the Australian Bovril Estates —evi-
dently because the rest of that co.’s shareholders
weren’t strong enough to stop it —£100,000 in 5
per cent, debentures at 91, redeemable in 10 years
at 105. The haggard co. controls a mere 10,000,000
acres in Australia and Argentine, and it has about
lost count of its cattle. Three thousand per ce.*t. !
The onlv consolation The Bulletin can get out of
it is through the reflection that, after all, there are
people who must regard the lordly C.S.R. Co. as
a pauper —which must be gall and wormwood to
the C.S.R.
THE GIDDY GHOULS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The first annual picnic pf the Undertakers’ Assist-
ants’ Union was held at Hampton, and it was sq
enjoyable a gathering that the union has decided to
make an attempt to have the picnic day gazetted a
holiday in each year.— Argus.
The drivers of the mourning carts,
The mutes so bright and gay,
The coffin-makers with their tarts,
Set forth at break of day.
Each mourning coach was tightly packed
With humans; at the rear
The hearses came, and these were stacked
With provender and beer.
The tablecloth —a pall—they laid, ~
While many willing hands
The coffin-hampers oped, aqd made
'their lunch upon the sands.
They drank “The and sang
Till they were out of breath,
And then a mute the next toast gave:
“Hjs Majesty King Death.”
The luncheon done, the merry band
In skilful combat viedj_
Nail-driving competitions and
Sod-turning tests were tried.
The afternoon sped forth to meet
The dark ; the sun lay dead ;
And ev’ning chill its winding-sheet
Across the landscape spread.
The eyes of day they stayed to close
When it had breathed its last;
Then from the beach the mourners rose,
And homeward journeyed fast.
For once Pa Time had been too fleet,
Each thought, when glad, but worn,
Their beds they sought, fresh-braced to meet
The corpses of the morn.

The Elusive Flower.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
UPON a time....a time,
With tireless feet there strode
A youth, a buoyant youth,
A-down a time-worn road.
Among the forest trees
Me heard the breezes sing,
And pleasant tales they told
Of great adventuring.
No shadows lurked a-nigh
To trouble and annoy ;
In lark-like, sheer delight
He carolled out his joy.
And at his song the woods
And woodland things were dumb ;
He sang of bliss to be
And golden moons to come.
And ever as he moved—
That youth in pilgrim-dress—
He sought the hidden flower
Of Perfect Happiness.
The good winds blew around,
The sun shone hour by hour;
In lark-like notes he sang :
“Where grows the Perfect Flower?”
The good winds blew around,
The sun in splendor shone ;
A cheering echo came:
“Thy quest shall end anon 1”
Beneath an ancient tree
He rested from the heat;
He drank a draught of wine—
The wine was honey-sweet.
And while he drank he laughed,
For, such is Fancy’s power,
Within the wine he saw
The color of the Flower.
The good winds blew around.
He trod the time-worn miles;
Anon, he met a maid
Of wondrous ways and wiles.
Then all was Heaven below,
And all was Heaven above;
He kissed her mouth and hair,
And breathed his soul in love.
And while he kissed he smiled,
For, such is Fancy’s power,
Within her eyes he saw
The promise of the Flower.
No more a youth, but grown
(His laughing boyhood gone)
To manhood’s height—a man
He journeyed on and on.
The morning sun no more
Made life a gracious boon ;
The shadows grew apace,
And it was afternoon.
League after league he fared,
No lQnger boisterous, gay ;
With serious, seeking eyes
A-down the time-worn way.
Three visions stayed his feet,
And each was brave and bold,
And one was laurel-crowned.
And one was robed in gold,
And one was iron-browed
And tall, an august tower ;
And they were known and named
As Fame and Wealth and Power.
Yet, ye who climb and rule,
And get and spend, may guess
That none contained the Flower
Of Perfect Happiness.
For thus ’twill always be,
And thus it was of yore ;
They offer painted leaves —
A semblance and no more.
Thereafter, slow, of foot, %
He stumbled on and on.
Till twilight greyed the world
And all the way was wan.
He had no song to sing,
In lark-like joyance keyed ;
The wine, so sweet of old,
\v as bitter-sweet indeed.
And did he find the Flower?
Dark Death his secret keeps.
This much T only know-
He fell asleep and sleeps.

RODERIC QUINN.
Crosby and the Cabman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rfl TIE second clause of -tlie Third Article
I of the Constitution of the Honorable
and Up-to-date Order of Bloques
forbade any member to give a brother mo e s
name when in any trouble to eit er ie
police or any private individual, but to can
himself Smith and give his address at the
parsonage or manse furthest away 10m
Elysium, the home of the Order. The ques-
tion was whether Crosby had committed a
technical breach of that rule.
Under other circumstances Crosby would
have been dealt with immediately, but we
felt diffident on the subject, as Crosby was
out of work and had not paid his share ol
the up-keep of Elysium for neaily t uee
months. Therefore we feared that he might
imagine we wanted to get rid. of him e
cause he was unfortunate. A hich was tiue,
because his misfortunes were due to his own
darned foolishness; but, all the same, we
wanted him to go of his own account, an
not because he felt uncomfortable. e ia
all been hard up at various times and sym-
pathised with impecuniosity.
Briefly the circumstances were these.
Although Crosby was out of
ally contrived to get fairly well filled with
the old familiar juice on Satuid. J g ■
On this particular eve he stayed argu g
the point with some brother toper in a Dago
fish shop till midnight, and after the Dagoes
had thrown them both out thev T)
kerb and argued it still more till John Dunn,
Esq., mentioned that it was toime t’ moove
am Then it suddenly occurred to Crosby
that the last tram had gone and Elysium
was nearly three miles away.
He rummaged in his pockets, and finding
a few coins which, owing to the liquor
fumes, he was unable to distinguish the
value of, he hailed a cab.
“Where to, sir?” said Cabby, who, having
just finished a curried tongue at the coffee
stall, was feeling good.
“’Lyshium ! Big house, near —hie !
corner Ocean-street ’n’ Burcnda-road. 3'
know? Stands right back, ’but six foot
from shtreet —liic.”
“Yessir, I’ll find it.”
After two attempts Crosby, assisted by
the friendly Mr. Dunn, fell into the bottom
of the cab, and then painfully climbed on to
the seat, where he broke into what he
thought was song as the cab rolled along
Elizabe tli-street.
It was nearly two hours since Crosby
had swallowed his last deep sinker, and the
cab doors being open, the fresh wind blow-
ing in on his face sobered him un wonder-
fully in a very short time. The cab rolled
along through the citv. traversed Padding-
ton, and then entered Woollahra, vvhere the
driver slowed down to get his bearings. By
this time Crosby was sober, painfully so,
and also very thirsty. He pulled out the
three coins he had in his pocket and dis-
covered them to be copners.
This ghastly tragedy froze his blood and
sobered him up thoroughly. He owed
Elysium Limited pounds already for food
and shelter, and to knock the Order up at
that hour on Sundav morning and ask it to
pay 7s. 6d. cab fare was quite impossible.
Crosby felt that he would sooner commit
the happy despatch on the kerb than even
consider such a thing; and yet the cheerful
party on the boot would demand seven and
sixpence without a doubt.
He turned over various schemes wildly,
frantically, in his mind. He had read a
weird story of two men getting into a han-
som cab, and one slipping out unseen by the
driver and leaving the dead body of the other
in the cab. Had he not been a drunken fool he
might have managed it, but with liis nerves
in their present state it was quite impos-
sible. Furthermore, he remembered that the
hero of the story was a light, thin man,
whose weight made no difference in the
position of the cab, whereas he, through
overfeeding and lack of exercise, weighed
13st. 81b. He swore to start physical cul-
ture in the morning, and then cursed him-
self for an idiot. What the devil was he to
do? If it came to the worst he couldn t
even fight the cabman ; that wiry, alert in-
dividual would walk rings round him while
he got his hands into position.
So he leaned back in the cushions in
blank despair and utter misery. In spite
of his misery he couldn’t help feeling it was
a good way to gu home- —there was a feeling
of solid comfort about it, and if he ever got
work again, he told himself- he would often

it, and . ..
“Here y’are, sir! Ilc-lie-seem that s
the name, isn’t it?”
And Crosby, looking out. saw the rose-
covered wall of Elysium, its ooen windows
with their bright curtains showing spotless
in the mixture of moon and gaslight, looking
a veritable haven of rest, a model of all
that a refined home ought to be.
He sat still among the cushions, wonder-
ing what on earth to do. A sort of tiem-
bling had seized him, and he felt sure his
legs wouldn’t carry him if he tried to stand.
On the other hand, if he didn’t get out
quickly the blessed cabman would get _ott
his boot, and then thore’d be no escaping
him. He jerked himself un, and fell out of
the cab on to the pavement, going down on
his hands and knees.
“Here y’ are, cabby, keep all above the
legal fare fer yerself. Goo’-ni’!”
“Thankee, sir. thankee! Hi, hold on,
boss, you’ve made a mistake! Strike me •
Stl Mr! Crosby had vanished through the side
entrance, and bolted it behind him.
The cabma" got down and knocked on
the door, softly at, first and then louder.
Crosby, stealing noiselessly upstairs not to
attract attention, heard the noise and
cursed in his heart. Arrived on the landing
he saw the door of the Presidents room
was open, and peeping in, saw that the Pre-
sident’s bed was empty. The window over-
looked the side entrance. He strode to the
window with all the dignity he could muster
and looked on the excited cabman serenely.
“Watcher matter—whatcher making
noise for, eh, cabby? Disgraceful!
“Lord love me, boss, whatcher think you
glV “Free ? half-crowns— legal fare ’bout four
bob,” said Crosby, whom the excitement and
exercise of walking had made drunk again.
“No, boss; ’twas three coppers, three
pennies; you’ve made a mistake, sir
His politeness made Crosby boldei. He
felt he had the cabman beaten.
“Tut, tut! man! I never carry coopers
All the change I had ’bout me. Paid 10 bob
f or supper, got four half crowns change,
sphent half-crown drinks shmokes, give you
thrde half-crowns. It’sh all ri ! Cood-m
cabby. I’ quite sober!” .
And then Mr. Crosby retired from the
window and made towards his own room.
On the wav he discovered lie was tiie oiiiv
member of the Order at home. The cabman
outside grew suddenly angry and started to
kick on the side entrance. If he awoke the
net of the household, the adopted Babe,
there would be an awful row. Crosby lum-
bered, as fast as he could, back to the vun-
d°“Here here! Slitop that infernal row.
Ring up polishe if you make noise. Go
’wav. like goo’ fellow. Go ’way !
“You’ll ring up the police, will you, you
swindling cow ! I like that, strike me pink
if I don’t. S’truth ! That’s the last straw.
Parss mo down mo faro or 111 bo after a
policeman meself to give you in charge
Come down an’ feel me pockets. Why, I
ain’t got three blanky half-crowns on me.
Come down, I say. and search me, and see
what sorter mess I’ll make of yer if yer
don’t give me me I only want me
fare, an’ I must have it.”
Then he looked up appealingly, to- find
Mr. Crosby making faces at him in the moon-
llSlie choked —this was too much. Rushing
to his cab lie sprang on the boot and drove
off to find a policeman.

Doan’s Backache Kidney P*ls are
sold by all chemists and stores at
2/9 per bottle (6 bottles 15/3), or
post free on receipt of price from
Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street,
Sydney.
KIDNEY DISEASE in its worst form comes on almost unnoticed, and often reaches an
incurable stage before it is found out.
That is why it is so serious. \ou may feel as if you have no kidney trouble —
there may be no symptoms except an occasional twinge of pain in the loins and back,
a heavy, drowsy feeling, or little watery swellings under the eyes or in the ankles And yet if
the water were chemically tested the kidneys might be found to be in a seriously diseased "state
calling for long and patient treatment.
In other patients, however, the symptoms may be more distinct ’ there may be sharp
pams m the back, gravel, urinary disorders or obstinate dropsy. Uric acid poison, left in the
blood by weak kidneys, may settle in the form of sharp, jagged crystals in the muscles and
joints, causing the pam of rheumatism and sciatica.
Kidney disease is hard to cure, because it is so difficult to tell from the symptoms how
serious a stage the disease has reached. But if you have any of the symptoms lose no time in
beginning with Doan s Backache Kidney Pills, and persevere with them until every trace of the
disease is gone-for as long as the least sign of kidney trouble remains, a sudden relapse is
always to be feared. v
Sydney Testimony .
LASTING CURE OF 3 YEARS.
u Mrs. H. Smith. 343 King Street. Newtown, says:
“I was troubled with my kidneys for a long time. I
had pains in my back, which were making me weak
and exhausted, and if I stooped I could not straighten
my back without assistance. The secretions were dis-
ordered, and contained a sediment like brick-dust. I
got very little rest at night, and always felt tired, and
my head ached incessantly. I thought I would never
get any better, but one day a friend advised me to use
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so I got some. Within
a week after commencing their use I began to im-
prove, and from that time on rapidly grew better. I
used eight bottles in all, and was cured. Every dis-
tressing symptom has gone, and I feel splendid. My
complete cure ought to convince the most sceptical
sufferer.”
Three years later Mrs. Smith says : “Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills are a wonderful remedy. They
cured me of kidney trouble three years ago, and I have
been in good health ever since.”
LASTING CURE OF 11 YEARS.
Chris. Kerrigan, 5 Gould Street, Sydney, says:
My husba-nd has been simply plagued with rheumatism
or the past 10 years. This malady attacked him in
the joints, and it was almost impossible for him to
work On one occasion he was laid up for 12 weeks.
He tried a number of liniments, but they afforded
him no relief: then he used blood remedies, but the
result was no better. I got Doan’s Backache Kidney
HUis, and after taking less than half a bottle of this
remedy he said he felt better than he had felt for 10
years. Gradually the pains lessened until he was
qmte cured He attributes his cure solely to the use
them^ nS Backache Kldnp y Pills, and he swears by
Eleven years later Mrs. Kerrigan confirms the
above: We were living at Maitland when I made the

It was after 10 o’clock Sunday morning
when he arrived on foot. Standing at the
window of his room with a fat cheroot in
his race was the President, gazing on the
street with a benign expression, and a look
Of cow-like peace in his eye. It was the
calm of a much-worried man who knows his
debtors cannot harass him that day at any

that a madman will always quail before the

The President recoiled, and -would have
made indoors, but just at that moment,
attracted by the noise, the Babe toddled to
the kitchen door, and seeing the violent
stranger set up a howl.
Shut up, I ain t hurtin you-—you owes

forward. The Babe tried to run. but fell

knocked the President down, and fell on

helpless and half-throttled.

ways towards the door. “That's why be

about that sort of horse-nlay, and the cab-
man had no. right to. .take a map -into his
cab like that- without collecting hi§ fare
from those, who- put him there. Let Kim
collect it from them.
This ingenious defence sounded somewhat
improbable, blit it seemed to be a case of the
cabman’s word against Crosby’s, and the
easiest way out was that suggested to the
Board by the President.
“Honorable bloques will see that the mat-
ter is purely a personal one between Brother
Crosby and the cabby, and which it would
be pfektimpttiotis for os to interfere in. If
the cabby fcoines to the hohse any taore he
.will have to be severely dealt With. 1 Will

The motion was 1 carried, and the re§alt
communicated to the waiting cabby who
had called back to know what we were 1
going to do about it, and had recognised
Crosby as the offender.
Learning the decision of the Board, he re-
marked that he would call round every day
and knock the beauty right off Mr. Crosby’s
face, and his threats had such effect on
Crosby that he took the cabman aside and
eptapfotnised for 4s, 6d., and borrowed 7s.

CONCERNING A COMMON COMPLAINT.
Of all common ailments perhaps Constipation is the one most fruitful of
ill-health and a potent cause of disease in a variety of forms. Too fre-
quently neglected (especially by women) it may result in grave conse-
quences, and all who suffer from it in any degree should set about
establishing a permanent cure without delay. Failure of the bowels to
act properly results in poisonous accumulations, impure blood, sluggish
liver, and a great number of disorders such as headaches, nervous debility,
anaemia, loss of energy, and even diseases of a chronic and dangerous
nature. If you are troubled with this really serious complaint do not
regard it as a light matter, and remember that the cure may be surely
and speedily effected by means of
