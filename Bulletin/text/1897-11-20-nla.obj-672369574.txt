THE RED PAGE.
One ponders with a flickering mouth the com-
plication of motives which impels our young
authoresses to endorse their literature with their
marriage-lines. The initial irascible ‘ What the
deuce is he doing on board this galley ? ’ soon
gives place to flattered male curiosity. Is it a
self-adulatory ‘ Observe my brevet! ’ or a self-
abnegatory ‘ Lo, all that I have is thine ! ’ or
a mixture of half-a-dozen things—this common
emotion which determines the title-page announce-
ment of ‘ Kirkham’s Find, by Mary Gaunt (Mrs.
H. Lindsay Miller),’ and of ‘ Teens/by Louise
Mack (Mrs. J. Percy Creed),’ and of ‘Miss
Bobbie, by Ethel Turner (Mrs. H. R. Curlewis) ’’
* * * * ' ’
About ‘ Kirkham’s Find ’ there is little to ear.
■The author dribbles commonplaces over a vast
number of pages through which lacklustre char-
acters walk slowly and gossip about nothing in
particular. In ‘ Dave’s Sweetheart ’ Mary
Gaunt left room for hope that Bhe might
become something more than the average
fluent female penster. There is dramatic
power in that book, and, so far as the women are
concerned, a good deal of dramatic insight. But
‘Dave’s Sweetheart’ for the most part lacks in-
tensity. The incidents are lost in a flux of flabby
words. The author attenuates in ten sentences
an impression which a vigorous writer would
paint vividly in two. The collection of short
stories called ‘The Moving Finger ’ exhibited the
same fault without compensating virtue. And
‘Kirkham’s Find ’ touches the nadir of feeble
flatulency. Scenes and people are indeed photo-
graphed minutely, with feminine precision; but, as
the author’s mind has no depth or scope or origi-
nality wherewith to glorify them, the whole is
only a sorry small-beer chronicle. And the
average woman’s pre-eminence as a small-beer
ohronioler was already well established.
* * • *
‘ Teens ’ is Louise Mack’s second book to see
light—the first, ‘ The World is Round/ dates last
year. Then Angus and Robertson, who publish
‘Teens,’ have a sequel to issue in 1898; a
London publisher many months ago accepted a
collection of short stories ; and there was a serial,
‘ln An Australian City,’published in a Sydney
magazine. Add many verses and a little mixed
journal-work ; —and admire the lady’s industry !
• * * m
‘ Teens ’ is sub-titled ‘ A Story of Australian
Sohoolgirls ’ naturally for Australian school-
girls. It is written so well that it could not be
written better. The author has taken her own
memories, enhaloed with the charm of childhood,
the romance of girlhood, and set them on paper so
delicately and so skilfully that not one iridescent
tint seems lost from life. Thus to look into one’s
heart is easy ; thus to write is the hardest thing
imaginable. It is less hard for a woman, because
women remain physiologically and characteristi-
cally nearer to children—their minds retain always
something of the childish standpoint and outlook.
Many women bloom with childhood’s fragrance all
their lives. But the art to scent with this frag-
rance an atmosphere of words is exceedingly rare
and admirable.
» * * *
Somebody has said that ‘ to be beautiful, a child-
story need be neither sad, nor mad, nor bad. If
it is the work of an artist it may be as natural as
you please, as happy, healthy, and pure spirited,
and yet be a work of art.’ ‘Teens’ fulfils these
conditions. Like Longfellow’s Priscilla, it is
‘modest, and simple, and sweet.’ Only in the
‘happy ’ quality does it fail a little : it wants high
spirits. The author communicates the right im-
pulse in the right way, but does not quite arrive
at the force of childhood’s irresistible impulse.
Compared with ‘ Little Women/that permanent
standard of girls’-book all-but-perfection, ‘ Teens ’
has more cleverness and less vivacity. It is no
less natural than ‘Little Women,’ but it is less typi-
cal ; because—because Louise Mack seems to have
been a little farther from the normal girl-urchfn
than Louisa Alcott. The difference must be prac-
tically imperceptible, however, for a normal girl-
critic r ‘ght a B e gives assurance that both
Teens ’ and ‘Little Women’ are books ‘to hug
tc bed with.’
*****
Ethel Turner’s ‘ Miss Bobbie ’ completes her
round half-dozen volumes : she will soon need a
whole shelf to herself. Thanks to some years-ago-
written chapters, ‘when the heart was young,’
‘Miss Bobbie’ quite maintains the author’s ex-
cellent level. It is the funniest of her books :
perhaps some of the fun is impossible fun ; but you
have to laugh, anyway—the exploits of ‘Suds’
will be content with nothing less. And, if you
take Ethel Turner’s artificial child-fairyland for
granted, and don’t look her gift ogres in the mouth,
‘Miss Bobbie’ is pleasant and interesting through-
out. The author is always in the stranger chil-
dren’s country—her experiences must have been
made out of the things not given to anybody else
—but qualms are so few and small in comparison
with charms that it would be ungrateful not to
swallow them and look sweet.

A cheaper edition of Kenneth Mackay’s ‘The
Yellow Wave’ is published. Nearly two years
ago it.was here mentioned as a valuable, memor-
able book—less for its literary than for its national
quality. It urges the truth that Australians will
some day have to fight for Australia, and that now
is the time to get ready. Withal, the story is
readable. British journals—* The Spectator, ■’* The
Academy/ and others—Draise it highly.
♦ * ' ~ * *
‘Darab’s Wine-Cup and Other Tales/ by Bart
Kennedy (Olliff) is a book just on the edge of being
memorable—and it might as well be in the abyss.
The author has a tremendous force of Celtic im-
agination, though it is not a very original force in
essence or effects. His style has rugged value ;
yet its crudity is continually close to anti-climax.
Noteworthy that the typically imaginative Irish-
man has rarely any sense of humorous incon-
gruity.

Glittering Anthony Hope seems dead !
Read at his last new book an hour.
That Is the story, this its thread,
He penned the tale, but it lacks his power.
Beginning to languish, too, like the rest;
Much has been changed by his fame, I think:
By ravenous publishers opprest,
He drowns his genius in seas of ink.
It is not too late yet, Anthony Hope, •
You can redeem yourself, firm and true;
For good stars meet in your horoscope,
Your earlier characters live and woo,
Flirt, laugh, skirmish—fight as of old,
And bewitch us—this oannot be denied;
Toward ‘The Prisoner ’ and ‘ Dolly ’ no heart is cold,
They are fellow mortals—naught beside.
We love you, Anthony, all the while 1
There are better things yet to come, we hold ;
There is place and to spare for villain’s guile,
And your nonchalant heroes—overbold.
So hush—here’s a bit of advice to keep ;
We want your genius fresh from your hand.
There, that is your secret, don’t try to reap
Gold for mere trash—you understand !
From ‘ The Philistine.'

America has now some storytellers who rank
with all but the very best elsewhere. And, what
is good to say, two or three of them seem emerg-
ing from the attenuated air of Boston culture
which has taken the red-corpuscles out of
so much American literature—seem well-pleased to
put nerve and strength into their work, heedless
of dogmatic fetishes and academic canons. For
one example, there is Hamlin Garland, a young
man still in the sunny thirties. His short stories
collected in ‘Main-Travelled Roads,’ in 1892,
describe some phases of American life as truly as
Henry Lawson’s stories describe some phases
of Australian; but Garland has breadth and
art to which Lawson has not yet attained.
Between ‘ Main-Travelled Roads ’ and ‘ Rose of
Dutcher’s Coolly/ issued last year, there was a
second book of short stories which does not seem to
have found an English publisher. (Australian
readers are far too dependent upon English
publishers : many excellent American books are
never seen in this country at all).
* * * *
The quality of ‘ Rose ’ is no whit better than
that of ‘Up the Coul6 ’ in ‘ Main-Travelled
Roads ’; she doubtfully leaves a stronger
impression than ‘Among, the Corn-Rows’; but
she fills a long story, and counts as a
greater effort, a more complete performance.
To give an idea of Garland’s literary stature,
it may be said that ‘ Rose of Dutcher’s
Coolly’ stands level with ‘Tess of the D’Urber-
villes.’ Garland, indeed, writes something in
Hardy’s manner, sensuously, keynoting in the
domination of the flesh. His ideal woman is
a magnificent creature six feet high, with bosom
and imagination, and hips and intellect, and
sweet blood and clear eyes (great stress on the
sweet blood and clear eyes), and a gait like a god-
dess. Likely enough Garland himself is an under-
sized little rat of a fellow, with a big head and no
physique worth mentioning—for that’s how things
usually go.
* » * *
Garland has not Hardy’s philosophy and Active
science ; but he has youth and fervency. ' Tess ’
wanted hot blood to make a masterpiece of her.
‘ Rose ’ is more simple and natural; she flows like
life itself, without an obvious motive ; and you can
feel Hardy’s motives all through his later works-
sources of profound artistic irritation. There is
no such trail-of-the-tract in Garland’s book.
If. Rose has a moral, she sheds it uncon-
sciously—it is her example, not her precept,
which urges every woman to go and be a magnifi-
cent creature six feet high. Some commenta-
tors have thought that Garland’s stress on
Rose’s sex —his presentation of the whole
woman, or something like her, without the
usual glosses and suppressions argues him
a woman himself. Nominally he is not; es-
sentially he may have a majority of feminine
elements. When it is generally recognised that,
in Weismann’s words, to every individual ‘the
primary constituents of both sexes are always
passed on from both sides/ there will be opened a
fine field of usefulness to the indeterminate pro-
noun se.
• * » *
Robert W. Chambers is another very capable
young American. His book of verse, ‘ With the
Band,’ has a touch of Kipling’s manner, but little
of Kipling’s strength. His novel, ‘ The Red Re-
public,’ is a pleasant, interesting story in the
second or third class, weaving a skein of romance
through the ugly days of the Commune. Inci-
dentally it shows once more how unneces-
sary it is for a lover to take out an in-
surance policy : he is bound to issue un-
scathed at page 350, or thereabouts : impavidum
feriunt shot and shell, Maxims and mitrail-
leuses. But artistically ‘ The Red Republic ’
is not so good as Chambers’s short stories —some
of which Poe would not be ashamed to sign. ‘ The
Maker of Moons/for example; or ‘The Messen-
ger.’ Then Chambers has another vein, an Am-
brose-Bieree vein, of which ‘ln the Name of the
Most High ’ is exemplar. And he has a third
vein, a vein of commonplace tenderness touched
with fancy, avoiding equally the mystic climax
and the warlike. Apparently he has not yet
settled which is his true line—if his versatility
will permit him to have one true line. But even
now both his promise and performance stand high.
* * * *
Surely there never was such a creative imagina-
tion as that of 11. G. Wells. It is easy to say
that his"stories are but science made fiction ; and
that, given the keynote, the tune plays itself.
But, apart from the fact that nobody but Wells
seems able to strike his keynotes, such an explana-
tion errs visibly. It is not the discovery, but the
development of his ideas that makes his talent so
astounding. The conception of a movement in
time, for example, akin to movement in space, is
not remarkably novel. Hundreds of people may
well have had it. But not one writer in a thousand
could utilise it at all—not one in a million could
utilise it as Wells has utilised it. Or take the
conception of an angel’s visit to earth—familiar to
everybody. What did everybody do with it till
Wells came and built his deiicious extravaganza ?
To be sure, there is nothing that is essentially
literature in all Wells’s work : his books are
merely brilliant tours de force —juggling feats of
fancy ; but they make uncommonly good reading.
Wells’s latest story, ‘The Invisible Man,’ is
just as clever as its predecessors. Most people
know that we see certain material objects because
they react to light in various ways—by reflection,
or refraction, or absorption, or by all together.
Well, the invisible man chemically causes such a
change in the molecules of his body that they
react to light precisely as common air does—so
that he cannot be seen any more than air can.
And he reckons he is going to have a good time—
seeing, for example, that he can walk into a bank
and help himself to sovereigns without anybody
being the wiser. If the theft was observed, all
the teller would see would be a handful of sovereigns
floating through the air ‘on their own’—and he
would probably be too astonished to protest
until too late. Unfortunately things don’t turn
out at all as the invisible man expects. England
is a cold country, for one thing; and he has to
wear clothes ; and when people see suits of clothes
walking round with nothing in them they natur-
ally make unpleasant remarks. By degrees the
man becomes an invisible Ishmaelite. For a
while he has the best of it—seeing that he is able
to trip up an opponent with an invisible foot, or
knock him down with an invisible fist; but in the
end he is hunted down and battered to death.
It’s a rattling story.
* * * »
One considers Hall Oaine with astonishment.
He worked up through more or less crude melo-
drama until in ‘ The Manxman ’ he reached the
strength of tragedy. That was indeed a fine
novel, epic in conception, noble in execution—
simple, true, and strong. And from ‘The Manx-
man ’ Hall Oaine drops all at once to the level of
‘The Christian’ false in art, in treatment
tawdry and hysterical. There is rarely such a
pulling of puppet - strings outside the penny
novelette. The characters, are fustian through-
out ; their talk is rant; their unnatural actions
are sawn to suit the author’s ridiculous precon-
ceptions. And a 50-000 edition of such a book
was sold at 6s. in a fortnight!
* * * *
Indeed, the book is well sauced to suit a pious
public. Cant alternates with lust, religious-mania
with sex-mania—which is just, since these are
obverse and reverse of the same medal.
♦ * * *
So the Nonconformist conscience is tickled now
by the spectacle of the Rev. John Storm de-
nouncing the worldliness of his ecclesiastical
superiors, and now by the spectacle of Glory
Quayle seducing a music-hall audience. Anon
religious-interest and sex-interest are combined,
and John, coming to kill Glory for the good of her
soul, is seduced to stay for the good of his body.
If George Moore, say, depicted such a scene so
coarsely, in the name of Art, there would be ter-
rible puritan outcry ; but Hall Caine is privileged
to be quite Biblical in his crudity, because he
writes ‘ in the name of the Lord ’—for much more
than the usual cash consideration.
* * * *
The book closes with stage-fire. John Storm is
killed by the Machine-God, and Glory Quayle
marries him on a death-bed of bathos. One is
sorry for John, who is an amusing fanatic, par-
ticularly when he offers to take Glory away from
the naughty musio-halls to a nice little islandful
of lepers in the South Seas, where they will read
Scripture to the lepers, and he will love her like a
sister. And she a red-haired girl too !
NOCTURNE—IN PROVENCE.
Did the vain garments melt in music from vour side?
Did you rise from them as lily flowers i’ the air’
-But you were there before me like the Night’s own
bride—
I dared not call you mine. So still and tall you were
I never dreamed that you were mine—l never dreamed
I loved you—l forgot I loved you. You were air
And music, and the shadows that you stood in seemed
Like priest* that keep their sombre vigil round a shrine-
Like somore priests that watch about a glorious shrine.
And then you stepped into the moonlight and laid bare
The wonder of your body to the night, and stood
With all the stars of heaven looking at you there.
As simply as a saint might bare her soul to God—
As simply as a saint might bathe in lakes of prayer—
Stood with the holy moonlight falling on you there
Until I thought that in a glory unaware
I had seen a soul stand forth and bare itself to God
A saintly soul lay bare its innocence to God.

Before the writers of to-day a harder problem lies
Than that which stood before the men who’ve won tin
laureled prize.
When Shakespeare was a novice at the art of writing
plays,
He’d no such competition as the men of modern days;
For when on paper first he put his pathos and his wit,
The plays of William Shakespeare were of course as yet
unwrit.
And so it was with Milton, when he sought life’s richest
pelf,
He never had a foeman like his highly-honored self.
Nor was there ever on the shelves in Addison’s great day,
Another gentle essayist to tourney for the bay.
And wondrous-witted Thackeray, in battling for hisfame,
Was not confronted everywhere by his own cherished
name.
And so, ye critics, gently deal with those poor wights
who now
Are struggling for the wreath that fame puts on the
worthy brow ;
For it is true, past question, that the raoe is harder won,
Because of what these giants of the gloried past have
done. . . .

Mr. J. H. WEHR, PARMER,
WASLEYS, S.A. writes:—“l can-
not refrain from adding my testi-
monial to your numerous list. In
justice to science, humanity, and
yourselves I must say that your
treatment of sorrowful afflictions is
past all belief. For seventeen years
I have been a sufferer, and four
months ago I went from bad to
worse ; in fact lost all hope of ever
being well again. When I visited
you I was at once placed under a
~ course of treatment entirely new to
m 3 self, and from the first I was able to attend to my
--'- -I “ fai 'mer. I am happy to state that I am now
welland better than I have been for years, but shall
follow your advice and take the remedies for some time to
do away with all risk. I shall ahvays remain indebted to
you for my wonderful cure.”
ANTHONY BARRY, Castle Inn,
Hindley-street, Adelaide, writes :
‘‘l will be glad if you will publish
thr- blowing for the benefit of suf-
ferers. For the last five years I
have been in the West, having
from Lake Barley to the
Horse Shoe Bend in Murchison.
Nearly the whole of the time I have
been a sufferer from Debility,
and loss of energj', always moping
alone, afraid to join in any
conversation, noises in the ears, and other symp-
toms too numerous to mention; in fact, was a nuisanoe
to myself and mates. Tried many advertised remedies
without obtaining any relief. On my way to New Guinea,
and hearing of so many from the West on their way to
other colonies breaking their journey at Adelaide to
obtain your treatment, I decided to do the same. lam
glad to say I now feel fit to continue my journey without
fear, and am sure I have only to take your remedies a
little longer to obtain a thorough cure. lam well known
m all parts of the West, and write this that my mates
others may know where they can obtain a certain cure.”

Mr. M. J. DENAHY, Beryl
Street, Broken Hill, writes -
“ Your remedies have acted
like magic in my case, having
been a sufferer for months
from weakness, and through
weakness I was so ill that I
had to give up work, and I
say truthfully I never thought
I should ever regain my
strength, as I took so much
medicine before seeing you
and without feeling the
slightest bit better, when
fortunately I met a patient of
yours, Mr. J. Kent, who
advised me to lose no time,
and, using his own words, he
, . . said; * The only chance vou
have is to go to Brunswick, Hamilton & Co who will
very soon put you right,’ and I am thankful I took his
advice, for since I took your remedies I am as well and as
strong as ever I was in my life. I cannot thank you suffi-
cient tor what you have done for me.”
REMARKABLE CURE OF DEBILITY
Mr. J. W. AITCHISON, 22 North-st„ Adelaide,'writes:
Gentlemen,—l cannot refrain from adding my testi-
mony to your extraordinary and most marvellous treat-
ment of one of the worst cases of Debility such as mine
was. ‘Since being under your care I can safely say that I
am a strong man once more, and the distressing svmDtoms
from what I was suffering from have all disappeared in a
most miraculous manner. I had previously been under
the care of five different practitioners for the past four
years ; purchased three different galvanic or electric belts
without deriving any benefit whatsoever. I had given ud
all hope of ever being myself again, when I was recom-
mended to see you. In two weeks’ time I began to feel
improvement, and your remedies did more for me than
the whole four years treatment with others. I feel as if
I can never thank you enough, and, as I should like other
sufferers to know what you have done for me, make what-
ever use you like of this.”
JOSEPH MARTIN, Cen
tral Mine, Broken Hill,
writes Accept this tes-
timonial in recognition for
the valuable services you
have rendered me by per-
forming a wonderful cure of
my case, which has been on
me for over five years, and
now that lam well and tell
you that I spent over £2OO
before consulting you, and
deriving not a farthing’s
worth of benefit from emin-
ent men makes my case one
that other sufferers should
hear about, so that they can
be treated and cured as I am,
and also made strong,
healthy, and happy, which I never thought could be done
until I was a short time under your care. I could con-
tinue for months writing of the misery and anxiety which
I have suffered, and it makes this testimonial one of great
value, not only to you, but also to those who may be
sufferers like I was, and those that read this and will take
my advice and place their case in your hands will not only
thank you, but also me for making it known to them

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN THE ATTIC.
What does it matter what they say
While there is the sunset, there the stars,
And over the city’s mistiness
The moon comes out of her silver bars.
And somewhere out of the sight of eye
The river runs through a low, long mist,
Under the bridge where the lovers cross
Into the fields for their evening tryst.
What does it matter ? Up and up
The mounting staircase twists and winds,
Till, see ! the starlight is almost touched,
The world that hates us is left behind.
Open the door with the rusty key,
Close and lock it, and enter in :
Straightway walk into Paradise
And let your time as a god begin.
Here in the attic all things fade
And dwindle into their own small size ;
Brain-fires burn when the coals go out,
And stars shine in with solacing eyes,
And weave a ladder into the room,
And wave and beckon until we dare
The first frail foot-hold. Then they turn
And veil their windows and leave us there,
Low and alone on the silver stair,
The attic window out of our sight,
The star’s gates hidden in mystery,
The shining ladder our only light.
Rolled in the mighty atmosphere
We stumble heavenwards bar by bar,
Through the midnights, till feet refuse,
And reel and tremble —and there’s the star.
What if the attic had not been !
A silver ladder would never dare
Down the stars to the basement world
Whose dirt would tarnish the shining stair.
Little it matters when the world
Tosses laughter against your mind.
Up to the attic’s loneliness !
Leave the world and the laugh behind
Open the door with the rusty key,
Close and lock it, and enter in ;
Straightway walk into Paradise,
And let your time as a god begin.

THEN LOVE ME!
If thou didst love me, all the hearts of men
Should be deep-stirred
With song’s divinest rapture—just as when
A full-heart bird
Is heard to thrill the very sky’s blue beauty
With wordless glee
Because his love has taught him song’s sweet duty
Of ecstacy.
So even I, with voice made sweet and loud,
And soft and clear,
Should drive with tones away earth’s grey care-
cloud,
And all should hear,
And hearing say : The birth of joy from Heaven
Is this, indeed—
This sound that spreads the sky-stretch ! As at
even
The sun’s death-deed
Doth color all the aether with Love’s roses
Of red, and gold
Of heart’s desiring, so this song reposes
In manifold
Delight on the horizon of the soul,
And speeds its fear,
Which was the grey. Ah, thus should hearts
be whole
Through you, Heart’s Dear !

THE “ETERNAL FEMININE.”
The sweet “ eternal feminine,”
Immutable in charming changes,
It sends queer wiggles down one’s spine—
Through Time and Space its magic ranges.
It’s swayed the world since earliest morn
Of Time, when Sex sprang into being ;
The male with sweetest yearnings torn,
The female, e’er enticing, fleeing.
Bear witness all our histories !
The blackest and the brightest pages
Are blazoned with its victories—
Its triumph through the rolling ages.
It breathes an incense-haunted air
That round its least belonging lingers ;
It lurks in gold or raven hair,
Thrills in the touch of slender fingers.
It conquered me a boy at school,
’Twas hid in someone’s shapely stocking;
Still, grown a man, I own its rule,
Its fetters there is no unlocking.
Ah me ! the flutter of a dress,
Or petticoat with lace upon it,
A bosom’s curve, a drooping tress,
A dainty face beneath a bonnet,
A little passing dubious glance—
And I, although I know I’ll rue it,
For some fair siren’s pleasure dance—
Each is a challenge to pursue it.
A challenge ever new and sweet—
I’d not resist it were I able ;
Nor would I lose its raptures fleet
To be the staidest sage of fable.
And sages, if all tales be true,
Not always might resist its power ;
They mostly met their Waterloo
In some more mortal hour.
Its charm, half earthly, half divine,
Is part of me I cannot sever ;
As temp’rance speakers say of wine,
“ Once taste it, you’re its slave for ever.”
So it will be until I die,
Nor death can change its power even ;
Unless our priests and poets lie
There are sweet Seraphim in Heaven !

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1897.
The 46 Iscariots.
The Bulletin has waited anxiously for
several weeks in the hope that some political
party in New South Wales would raise a
loud public protest against the treachery of
a majority of the Assembly to the cause of
Federation. So far, it regrets to see, no
protest worth calling such has eventuated.
Yet there never was an occasion in the his-
tory of the province when an outbreak of
devastating wrath was more called for. When
the Assembly, by a large majority, accepted
the Bill providing that 80,000 affirmative
votes should be required before New South
Wales could join the Federation, instead of
60,000 as previously agreed upon, it com-
mitted a disgraceful breach of faith, which
had not behind it one excuse that can bear
public inspection. It went back on its
agreement with the other provinces ; all the
provinces which prescribed any minimum
vote at all fixed it, as nearly as possible, on a
common basis, and required that the Federal
Constitution should be accepted by the
suffrages of, as nearly as possible, the same
proportion of the population. There might
be no written or spoken agreement, but the
uniformity of the arrangement showed that
there was, at all events, a tacit one, and
New South Wales deliberately proposes to
break it in pieces. The Assembly had no
mandate from the people for its action ; there
wasn’t even a semblance of reference to
the electors, who never once heard about
the matter until it was brought before Par-
liament. There was no change of public
circumstances to account for this sudden
reversal of the arrangement under which the
negotiations have hitherto proceeded. Except
that the Federal election had been held in
the interim, and sundry politicians who
hoped to sit on the Convention had been
wiped out by ridiculously large majorities,
and sundry oracles of parochial Bumbledom
had discovered, when the vote wai counted,
that their chance of a seat in an Australian
National Legislature was nil, and sundry
people who did get in did -so with much
greater difficulty than they expected, the
conditions are exactly the same as they
were a few months ago when the Assembly
decided that 50,000 affirmative votes would
be good and sufficient reason why New South
Wales should become a party to the Com-
monwealth. And absolutely no cause was
assigned for this amazing change of front.
* * » •
Still The Bulletin opines that there was
a cause. Some nine or ten months ago the
cornstalk Assembly, by a very large majority,
accepted the 50,000 minimum, recognising
that there was a fair chance to get 50,000
votes even on an abstract question like
Federation. Therefore, it is fair to assume
that it wanted Federation then. To-day
there is a large majority in favor of the
80,000 minimum which, judging by the ex-
perience of all past general elections, is an
impossible number, therefore it appears that
the Assembly doesn’t want Federation now.
So far as the drafting of the Constitution has
gone, New South Wales has got everything
it seriously demanded except the possession
of the Federal Capital, and that matter is
still open ; consequently the assumption is,
not that there is any change in the Federal
situation, but that there is a serious change
in the personal interests of the local politi-
cian. And in the first place it must be
remembered that Federation is a matter on
which the interests of the nation and those
of the common barn-door politician are
directly hostile. There will be room in the
Federal Legislature for about 36 New South
Wales representatives, so even if they are all
chosen from the two Provincial Houses,
about 160 members must be left behind in
obscurity. They will sink into mere glori-
fied aldermen with diminished power, very
little dignity, and probably with less salary
and perquisites than they now enjoy.
Therefore, while the people want Federation
for the sake of good government and pros-
perity, and for the making of an Australian
nation, the great majority of the politicians
—the 160 who will be left—have an immense
number of solid reasons for not wanting it.
* * * *
Until the Federal election came off no one
had any idea who would be left. There
never was before an election with the whole
province as a single constituency, and every
politician who was solid in his own constitu-
ency of Smith’s Curse probably reckoned
himself among the possibilities. The Federal
poll dissipated a great many beautiful
dreams of this kind. The fact that an
ex-politician headed the poll by a vast
majority, and that two men who were also
entirely out of politics (Messrs. Wise and
Walker) were among the ten, showed that,
while the very scanty supply of loaves and
fishes to be divided was not nearly enough to
go round, there was a serious danger that
even that limited provender would have to
be shared with outsiders. Quite a number
of robust little politicians were then enabled,
for the first time, to size themselves up as
they appeared, not in the eyes of one little
township, but in those of the nation at large,
and did it with disastrous results. And, as
a natural result, a good many humble but
vociferous road-and-bridge members and de-
partment trotters, who formerly thought they
had powerful reasons for helping Federation
along, discovered instead that they had very
good cause to keep it back to the best of
their ability.
* * * *
Further, there were five Premiers at the
Convention, and only one of them at the
most can be Premier of United Australia.
There were about 30 Ministers and ex-
Ministers, and probably 24 of them
must either stay behind among the com-
mon, unconsidered herd who are left,
or else get into the Federal Legislature
as mere private members. And the Conven-
tion proceedings doubtless gave some of
them a painfully unexpected indication that
they would be among the melancholy residue.
It is an uncharitable conclusion, but in the
utter absence of any other visible motive
the logical assumption is that the new depar-
ture, which promises to make Federation
utterly impossible in New South Wales, is
simply the revolt of the men who see that
they are going to be left. And the probable
reason why they didn’t revolt nine months
ago is that their bladder heads had not been
pricked they didn’t know till after the
election and the Convention that they were
going to be left.
* * * *
New South Wales is not quite the only
province which threatens to go back on
the national cause. South Australia is
dabbling with an amending scheme by which
the local Parliament is to have power to
alter the Federal Constitution before sub-
mitting it to the people, or to refuse to sub-
mit it to the people at all. If it carries out
this idea, and if it does alter the Consti-
tution, it will thereby make union impos-
sible ; there can be no Federation if
four provinces accept one Constitution while
the fifth accepts another and an entirely
different one. The Queensland Government
has introduced the Federal Enabling Bill
with the same proviso—but then no one
takes Queensland seriously in the matter.
And in any case New South Wales's breach
of faith is by far the worst. The other pro-
vinces are not essential to the Federation,
whereas it is expressly provided in the
Enabling Act that New South Wales is
essential ; therefore, their defection need not
break up the union completely, while the
defection of New South Wales must do so.
Moreover, the one proposal only gives the
Legislature power to block Federation with-
out committing it to any such course, and
it is quite possible that no bad results may
ensue. The other proposal —that accepted by
New South Wales Assembly—it is almost a
matter of certainty does block Federation
absolutely. Few persons seriously imagine
that it is possible to get 80,000 votes—
almost one-third of the entire number on
the rolls—on any abstract matter which
doesn’t affect the fiscal issue, or rouse up the
Orange, or Catholic, or Presbyterian, or
other religious vote ; which doesn’t wake up
the drink interest or the teetotal fanaticism,
which has no personal element in it at all,
and which is in no way related to the local
road, or bridge, or railway, or culvert, or to
the Labor question, or to anything else that
the community is accustomed to take an in-
terest in.
* * * *
The Bulletin trusts that the Upper
House will, for once, justify its existence by
throwing the Federal Amendment Act to the
winds. In all ordinary cases, this paper
holds that the Upper House should not in-
terfere, and that, for good or evil, the
people’s representatives should have their
way. But in this case the circumstances are
exceptional. The Assembly does not even
profess to have any popular mandate behind
it; it couldn’t possibly have one, as this im-
portant matter was not even dreamt of at
the time of the ’95 election. And, as the
matter is one on which the interests of the
nation are directly at variance with those of
the Assembly, the action of the latter body
is to be viewed with especial suspicion. The
Council would at least not be exceeding its
rights if it requested Premier Reid to appeal
to the people on the question and get a direct
mandate—or as direct a one as it is possible
to get in the chaos of a general election —on
the subject, and promised to pass the
measure with all possible speed as soon as
that mandate, or anything even colorably
resembling it, was forthcoming. If the
Council can’t do this much on so important
an occasion, it is difficult to imagine what
that body exists for.
On Behalf of the Widow.
Despite all the assurances of an optimistic
Premier, the fact sticks out conspicuously in
the new taxation proposals that the N.S. W.
Treasury is in desperate straits for money.
Premier Reid having solemnly pledged himself
not to tax the foreign importer, and to remove
the burden of import duties from the shoulders
of the people named Hoch and Bock and
Schmidt and Himmeliiochenstaufen, who
live by bringing in the thing that is made in
Germany, there is no resource but to pile up
new taxes on the local Cornstalk whose name
isn’t Schmidt, and w’ho consequently doesn’t
matter. Some of the new duties are unobjec-
tionable enough ; some are small and petti-
fogging and ridiculous ; some others are a sinful
tax on a very poor and distressed section of the
community. The stamp duties are mainly
remarkable for their beautiful comprehensive-
ness. Under the new regime there will be a
stamp duty chargeable on almost everything—
except the Sydney newspaper, which is still to be
carried through the post at the public expense,
and humped to the remotest part of the
country gratis by train and steamboat and
coach ; and as the Sydney paper would probably
turn and rend the Reid Ministry asunder if it
wasn’t carried gratis, the reason why its
wealthy proprietary will still be pauperised
out of the public pocket is, possibly, not very
far to seek. But, apart from the protected and
artificially coddled newspaper proprietor whose
industry will be subsidised as heretofore, there
will be a great change all round.
* * * *
Under the new order of things everybody
who swears by means of the familiar affidavit
to the truth of anything must put on a shilling
stamp. If he makes a declaration instead of an
affidavit he must also put on a shilling stamp.
If anybody in distressed circumstances wants
to sell or mortgage his four-roomed cottage
and goes through the necessary form of getting
it valued, and the valuation is £55, he must
pay for a ss. stamp. If the humpy is only
valued at £2l he must pay for a half-crown
stamp ; if it is worth £lO5 the law falls on him
for 10s. At the same time a valuation of
£lOO,OOO apparently costs only 205., so the poor
man falls in heavily as usual. If you get your
furniture or jewellery valued for any purpose
the stamp duty comes in. Again, there is
a stamp duty on repairs ; if the harmless,
necessary builder writes that he reckons it will
cost Bs. 3d. to repair the leak in the roof, that
involves Is. stamp duty ; and if he estimates
that the lean-to can’t be made really habitable
under £2l, the duty will be 2s. 6d. When
seven sanguine men enrol themselves under
the Companies Act to work some over-rated
quartz outcrop which ultimately comes
to nothing, the stamp duty will be £5.
A letter stating that 10 shares have
been allotted to you in the Lost Soul Gold-
mining Co. is to carry a threepenny stamp.
Every scrip, whether it represents 100 shares
in the Union Bank, value £2500, or 10 shares
in the Hungry Ghost mine, worth (at present)
one penny each, is to carry a threepenny stamp
also. If anybody’s house and furniture are
insured for £5OO, he is to pay Is. Bd. stamp-
duty on each premium ; and, if lie insures his
life for £l2OO, so that his widow may have 18s.
a week certain when he dies, the stamp-duty is
to be £2. If he insures for £6O, so as to pay
for his fuueral, the stamp-duty is Is. If lie
signs a proxy, so that someone can get up on
his behalf at the meeting of the society he is
insured in, and ask what the directors have done
with the money, the stamp-duty is 3d. If you
supply goods or labor, and take a P.N. (which
has to be stamped) because you can’t get cash,
and the P.N. is dishonored, and you lose both
the money and the goods, it will be necessary
to pay Is. for a stamp before you can take pre-
liminary proceedings against the defaulter.
These are a few of the things which will require
stamps of various amounts put on them when
the new order of things gets fairly started in
New South W ales, and the things with stamps
on them not above enumerated are legion.
* * * •
Most of these things, however, are only comic ;
it is in the new probate duties that the pathetic
element comes in. Under the proposed system
the rates of probate-duty are practically trebled,
or perhaps quadrupled; the 5 per cent, duty
begins when the estate of the late lamented is
worth £20,000, whereas it used to begin at
£50,000 ; and whereas 5 per cent, was formerly
the maximum tax, the highest rate levied now
is 10 per cent. In addition to this, whereas
estates under £2OO used to go free, there is now
no exemption whatever. With his usual in-
capacity for sticking to the unvarnished facts
of the case, Premier Reid recommended his
new tariff on the ground that it was identical
with the one that “ has been adopted for many
years in Victoria ” ; which is absolutely incor-
rect, as the merciful Victorian law exempts all
estates worth less than £lOOO, and lets off the
widow, children, and grand-children at half-
rates where the property to be divided is worth
less than £50,000. He also alleged that it was
identical with the Queensland scale, which was
equally inaccurate, as Queensland also lets the
widow and children off at half-rates. Likewise
he stated that his policy was the one adopted
in South Australia, which it isn’t, as South
Australia gives exemption up to £5OO in the
case of widows or children, and up to £2OOO it
lets them off at half-rates. Why Premier
Reid should have gone out of his way to make
these statements it is difficult to imagine.
Possibly it was mere ignorance, or possibly it
was owing to that ingrained habit of inaccuracy
which makes it safe to bet at all times that his
figures are wrong and that his facts won’t stand
inspection.
* * * *
In The Bulletin’s opinion the proposal to
abolish all exemptions in the case of probate
duties is a monstrous inhumanity. This world
is a cold place for the widow at all times. And
Australia is a colder place for her now than it
ever was before. Even the sober, industrious
and economical artisan can seldom leave over
£2OO worth of property behind him when he
dies, in the present state of the labor-market.
And £2OO worth of property only means a
wooden cottage of four rooms and a kitchen—a
cottage standing on six wooden stumps, with a
shaky fence in front and a creaking gate and
an-eighth of an acre of suburban desola-
tion for a back-yard ; also, some plain furni-
ture, the old man’s clothes and his
silver watch, and the remnant of his last
week’s wages. His widow, as a rule, has three
moderate-sized children; the artisan, whose
sole, or almost sole, amusement is getting mar-
ried, seldom has less than three. She has lost
her only source of income, and has to pay
funeral expenses and medical charges as well,
and to go out and hustle in a world where
women’s work is scarce and horribly ill-paid to
boot. And Premier Reid— the man who
climbed into office on the assurance that he
was going to shift the burden off the poor and
deposit it with a thump on the broad back of
the rich—proposes to levy an extra tax of £2
on the bereaved woman and the orphaned
family. Even the direst necessity for taking
off Dibbs’ duties on sporting ammunition,
playing-cards, plate, carriage-cloth, engravings,
scented soap, fireworks, Brussels carpet, furs,
opera-glasses, gilt-mouldings, top-hats, pianos,
organs, jewellery, lace, oil - paintings, per-
fumery, silks and the like, can’t justify this
proceeding ; and the urgent need to subsidise
the Sydney press by carrying its wares free at
the public expense, so as to keep it from turn-
ing upon and rending the Government, is no
sufficient excuse for such a mode of money-
raising.
♦ * * *
In The Bulletin’s opinion the Victorian
exemption of £lOOO is none too large. Where
the estate of the deceased only pans out for
£lOOO, and it is the sole support of his widow,
and possibly his young family as well, that
sum, however liberal it may look by comparison
with the means of most widows, only amounts
to a provision of 15s. per week at the utmost as
interest goes nowadays, and for the first year it
is proposed to take one-fourth of this as taxa-
tion ! If Premier Reid regards a lone woman
with 15s. a week as a fit subject for special
taxation, then his ideas about how to take the
burdens off the poor and pile them on the rich
are built after a curious fashion. It is that
politician’s proudest boast that he has done
more towards making Sydney a free port than
was ever done before, and apparently he has
made it so free that no one can do anything
while he is alive without putting a si amp on it,
and that no one can die outside the Benevolent
Asylum without a heavy duty being levied on
his surviving relatives. And even the blessed
privilege of knowing that the foreign-made
goods of Himmelhoch and Schmidt and
Schroder now' come in free and unhindered
may cost, at this rate, a great deal more than
it is worth*
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Majority of Six.
The Maoriland Government survived the latest
motion of censure by a majority of only six.
Many Governments have lived all their lives on
a credit balance of no more than six, but com-
pared with the majorities which the Seddon
Ministry used to have, the figures look like the
beginningof disaster. Certainly there was alarge
desertion among its followers, and now that the
big Government following has once shown signs
of disintegration it will probably never again be
quite the solid affair it was. The motion of
censure which so nearly upset the Liberal Cabi-
net was directed against Seddon personally, for
his action in holding a paid billet (salary alleged
to be ,£IOOO a-year) as Maoriland representative
of a British mining syndicate. It was claimed
that when Seddon, as representative of the
syndicate, appealed to Seddon as head of the
Government for some concession or other,


some very stinkful things might happen—
though it was not alleged that anything
of a stinkful character had happened up to date.
The censure motion was not moved by Captain
Russell, the Opposition leader, probably
because Russell is mixed up with a big land
and mortgage co., and to ask the House to
throw out Premier Seddon because he belonged
to a gold-mining co., and put in Premier Rus-
sell, who belongs to a big land-grab co., instead,
would have looked a trifle ridiculous. But
though one of Russell’s understrappers acted in
his stead, the result of the motion, had it been
successful, would almost certainly have been to
put Russell (and his land-syndicate) in office.
Anyhow, the narrow majority is the first
definite sign that the country is beginning to
grow weary of the old Ballance Seddon Govt.,
as it grows weary of everything in course of
time. The good works that this Govt, did
are many. It saved the Bank of N.Z., and
thereby averted an appalling panic. It created
a State Land Bank and gave cheap money to a
community which was formerly ground
down by usury. It compelled factory and
workshop owners to give their employes
light and air and a reasonable amount
of comfort. It shortened the hours of labor ;
minimised the sweating evil ; widened the
franchise ; and burst up many big estates, and
supplied farms for a multitude of small settlers.
It shifted a lot of taxation off the poor and on
to the very rich. It was the first Government
that ventured to attack the curse of usury,
to seriously attempt an Old-Age Pension system
—now nearing completion—and to deal with
the Midland Railway incubus. And, at the
worst, its finance' was a hundred times more
honest than that of any other Maoriland
Government for 25 years back, and its record
of Democratic legislation is vastly better than
that of any other Government that ever existed
in the Seven Provinces. Above all things, it
has succeeded. The industries of Maoriland, as
shown by the number of persons employed in
manufactures, have gone ahead far faster dur-
ing the last four years of Socialistic legislation
than those of any other province. Maoriland
is the only province, barring Westralia, which
has no accumulated deficit. It has a remark-
able increase of population and a tolerably
regular surplus, and its great dilapidated bank
is now safely out of the mire. But very little
is heard of these things now. Maoriland poli-
tics mostly centre at present round Joseph
Ward’s insolvency, and Seddon’s syndicate
billet, and the exorbitant bill which he sent in
for his Jubilee expenses, and the fact that
Minister M'Kenzie’s sons bought one of the
B.N.Z. estates, and other personalities. More-
over, the Seddon Government is slowly failing
through old age; the country gets weary of every-
thing and everybody in time, and nothing on
earth could prevent the mana of that long-en-
during Ministry from decay. It has done such
great things that it has to keep on doing greater
things all the time to maintain its reputation,
and if it can’t do them it will probably be thrown
out before very long to give place to the old
Tory crowd, which never did any great things
whatsoever. Probably Richard Seddon is
wise in his generation in hanging on to his
rather shady syndicate billet. He has toiled
incessantly as a Minister for seven years, and
run the country for nearly four years, at less
than half the salary given to the man who only
runs a bank. Also he has occupied a position
which leaves very little chance of saving money,
and his billet is liable to desert him at any
moment, and he is an old man with no profes-
sion to fall back upon. So he hangs on to his
little syndicate job as something to fall back
upon when the country has ejected its idol
and Richard of Kumara is wanted no longer.
Sensible man !
A Huge Blunder.
Never was the want of a strong Democratic
party, with a strong leader, more conspicuous
in N.S.W. politics than in the Lucknow strike
debate. The Government promised to do its
duty by opposing the Wentworth co.’s demand
for exemption. All the troubles—including the
dilapidated state of the mine, which necessarily
followed on the partial cessation of work—arose
through the co.’s attempt to cut down wages to
a miserable figure, and its insistence on a
degrading and unlawful authority to search the
houses of its employes, and under these circum-
stances the Government had every right, as the
co.’s landlord, to appear by counsel and argue
that its tenant had no claim for special con-
sideration. It lacked the courage to carry out
its purpose, still the purpose was good.
And the Opposition, instead of censuring
it for not carrying out its good intention,
actually tried to censure it for having any
good intention at all. The Labor-party must
have voted against the Government if the com-
plaint had been that it didn’t carry out its
commendable purpose; when the plaint was
that the Government, in addition to acting
badly, should have meant badly as well, every
democratic vote had to go with the Reid
Ministry. A tactician like Parkes would have
blown the Reid crowd to the winds with such
a case, and an honest democrat who had no
tactics at all would have done likewise.
Premier Reid is a chronic blunderer of a very
bad kind, a shuffling mediocrity, a man of half-
measures, and unfinished purposes, and broken
promises, and evasions, and failures, and in-
tentions that go askew, and muddle and mis-
representation. But he is the one-eyed man in
the kingdom of the blind, and his one eye is
bland and glassy, and always fixed on the main
c hance, so he prospers.

The Dead Baby-Farmer and the Live
Abortionist.
Writes a man who knows what he is talking
about: —
Dear Bulletin,— With reference to Mr. Sydney Maxted’s
contention, in Sydney Daily Telegraph of Nov. 2, that
local child-protective legislation has produced excellent
results in the diminution of infanticide, let me point out
that this evil cannot—any more than any other anti-social
practice—be eliminated merely by repressive legislation.
Statistics doubtless do show a marked diminution in
recorded cases since the passing of the Children’s Protec-
tion Act of 1892. But this may merely prove that more care
is taken to prevent detection, and that the further-
reaching evil of abortion is more prevalent now than for-
merly. Before the Act became law it was the baby-farmer
who flourished ; now ifc is the abortionist who waxes fat,
and the hospitals are crowded with the victims of mal-
practice. The hospital authorities are forced by circum-
stances to become accessories after the act, because both of
the urgency of the cases and the impossibility of gaining-a
conviction in 999 cases out of a thousand, they are forced
to grin and bear it. Humanity affords the grim example
of an inherited appetite developed out of all proportion
to the necessities of race-propagation, and accompanied
by ever-increasing difficulties in the way of maintaining
the “ inevitable consequences. ” Results: bagnios, pro-
miscuous immorality, illegitimacy, infanticide. Repress
post-natal infanticide—and the vendor of pills for female
“obstructions” and the manipulator of the deathful
darning-needle reap a golden harvest. In this respect, at
all events, Kipling may fairly be reversed. “We may
lighten the curse of Evk when we’ve lightened the curse
of Adam ! F.
The Dishonored P.N’s.
The present N.S. W. Parliament is now almost
ended, barring a very brief session, which is
promised about April, to deal with Federal
matters, and most of Premier Reid’s promissory
notes have come back marked N.S.F. Of the
democratic measures which were promised, or
half-promised, at the beginning of the Reid
Government, almost everyone has dropped into
peaceful oblivion. The State Bank is never
heard of now ; neither is the State Land Bank,
or the State monopoly of paper-money. The
Land for Closer Settlement law, which was to
burst up the big estates and settle the fertile
eastern districts with a multitude of small land-
holders, has perished by the wayside. The
Local Government Bill fell off the vehicle some-
where, and broke its unobtrusive neck. The
Reform of the Upper House never even-
tuated. There is no absentee - tax after
all. The Land-tax, which was once expected to
be a democratic measure, proved to be a mere
revenue-raising device which strikes the strug-
gling agriculturist just about as heavily as it
does the speculator and monopolist. The
Income-tax, instead of being graduated to lay
the chief burden on the man of wealth and on
the idle man who lives upon his accumulations,
is another mere revenue device which grinds the
large and the small man very much alike. The
Reid Government will go to the country with
hardly one democratic action to its credit. A
strongly democratic Opposition, which declared
itself willing to do all the things the Ministry
has left undone, and which had a good enough
record to convince the country that it would do
them, could sweep the polls at the 1898 election
and send Reid and Sunday Brunker into
obscurity ; but, unluckily, as Reid sinks into
somnolent Toryism Lyne tries to go one
better by being more Tory than Reid, and
between the two there seems to be no hope
anywhere. And yet, when one considers how
the Reid combination has sold the democracy,
and how shamefully it has gone back on Federa-
tion, and views the ever-increasing pile of its
dishonored political P.N’s, it seems incredible
that some big, brainy democrat can’t be found
to rise to the occasion and create a new party.
The spectacle of the Freetrade Tory party and
the Protectionist Tory party clawing for office,
and the Labor-party—the one avowedly demo-
cratic organisation in the Assembly—drifting
along to no good purpose, is far from edifying.
The Far-West Aboriginal.
The Westralian Government is making another
vigorous effort to get at the local aboriginal.
When W.A. got a Constitution in 1889, it was
provided that the dispossessed western nigger
should be placed under the care of an indepen-
dent board, and that 1 per cent, of the revenue
should be set aside as a fund for the education
of the rising aboriginal, and for the support of
the old toothless autochthon as he goes down-
hill to the grave. Last year this fund ran to
nearly .£30,000 —probably about £1 per annum
for each nigger, to cover education, medical
attendance, pauper relief, old-age pensions, &c.,
for the entire race, and the salaries of the men
who looked after them ; and it was felt that
such a sum was wholly extravagant. The in-
dependent board, which was to watch over the
aborigine and be a father to him, was duly
appointed, but it had no machinery for doing
its work, and was practically a dead-letter. The
administration was really done by a Parlia-
mentary official outside the board, and by this
means the money was kept under the control
of the little Forrest ring. Also, there is no
doubt that the aborigine was looked after. In
no Australian province was he ever flogged so
vigorously or conscientiously or regularly. He
was captured and run in with manacles on him,
and apprenticed at practically no wages, and
lots of hard work, to the Government’s friends,
and they spared no expense in the matter of
flogging to keep him in the way he should go.
It was no uncommon thing to see the police
bringing 16 of him chained together in one lot
to be civilised and enlightened at the cost of
the fund, and the W.A. Government did its
duty by him all it knew. All the same, it re-
gards the £30,000 a year as unjustifiable extra-
vagance, so a bill is now before Parliament to
abolish the Board and reduce the vote for
whaling the original possessor of the soil to
£SOOO a year. For all the good that the native
ever got out of the existing arrangement the
grant might as well be reduced to £SOOO, or
even a great deal less, and the British Govt.—
which thought it was doing a great and humane
act when it insisted on the 1 per cent, system
and the abortive Board—has been wheedled into
upsetting the aboriginal’s apple-cart. Aprevious
negotiation revealed the fact that the British
authorities were inclined to stick to the original
conditions, and the only time when the loyal
Westralian Government and Parliament got
right out of its usual grovelling habit of mind,
and denounced John Bull, almost in so many
words, as an interfering old fool, was
when that preliminary attempt at spoiling
the native was coldly received. This time
it is cabled that the scheme will probably get
through. As £SOOO a year will fully cover
all the care and education that the native ever
got or is ever likely to get, the arrangement
seems quite unobjectionable. In fact, the
native will probably be rather better off under
the new system than the old one. The Govern-
ment, with a large, fund to expend on him, had
to make a pretence of doing something, so its
various officials harried the miserable heathen
from pillar to post, and made Ids li f e a misery
and his death painfully suddtn With a greatly
reduced vote the black man may possibly get a
little rest.
A Roebourne (W.A.) jury has just returned
the customary verdict that the nigger died from
natural ‘causes. It was the usual story. The
indentured heathen (indentured means being
bound for a long term of years to work almost
any number of hours per day, for any kind of
food and lodging, and under any conditions, at
no wage worth mentioning) ran away. He was
brought back and walloped with a stick—this
fact was admitted by all the witnesses—by his
humane boss, and he promptly died. Two other
natives belonging to the same station, and also
liable to be walloped, naturally testified that
the deceased didn’t seem to be absolutely
pounded to death ; if The Bulletin was an
aboriginal on a Westralian station it would
probably be equally careful about its evidence.
A medical man testified that the remains, when
he saw them, were so much decomposed that the
cause of death was unascertaiivable —the de-
ceased was buried unobtrusively on the station,
and it was not till two months later, when he
was in a safe state of decay, that the law dug
him up and inspected him. Then the jury
acquitted the accused right off, the general
feeling being that the thrashing was rather
calculated to prolong life than otherwise, and
that the lamented nigger died chiefly from
insufficient walloping, combined with the wrath
of God at his conduct in bolting from a loving
master. The Westralian aboriginal’s habit of
dying from purely natural causes immediately
after being struck in a merely nominal fashion
by his kind master is simply unaccountable.
Stipendiary and other magistrates in inviting
lay persons, as Mr. Smithers did in a Sydney
court, the other day, to take a seat on the
Bench during the hearing of cases, follow, it
must be admitted, an example set by several
Supreme Court Judges. But example and copy
are both bad, and some day an accused will
focus public reprobation on this peculiarly
brassy brand of courtesy to “ distinguished ”
visitors. The Bench which tries an accused
should be composed of Justices or other
accredited ministers of the law—and of these
alone. Monocled globe-trotters or petticoated
relatives of the presiding Judge have not alone
no right to the seats of judgment, but actually
detract from the impersonal character of the
Blind Goddess. If is Justice plus a brother-
in-law, a maiden aunt or a globe-trotter,
which, in such circumstances, looks down on
the prisoner in the dock. A prisoner may
properly resent being made this “ show ”
of ; he may claim that the Bench, like the jury-
box, shall be reserved for the parties directly
associated with the study of his guilt or inno-
cence. It is hoped that some day a prisoner
will have the nerve to demand that companion-
able magistrates and Judges shall dismiss from
the Bench their opera-box attachments.
4.
One of the bitterest accusations brought against
the present Maoriland Government is that
when Treasurer Ward’s hopeless overdraft had
practically wrecked the Colonial Bank, it made
an arrangement by which that institution was
taken over by the State-managed B.N.Z. The
charge is only another proof that any stick is
good enough to beat a dog with—especially if
the dog is not so young as it used to be. The
B.N.Z. bought up the Colonial’s business at a
valuation made by non-political experts, and
the bargain, judged by the increased profits
since shown by the former, was a reasonably
good one. The price received for its business
saved the Colonial from very much worse
disaster ; if it hadn’t sold out but had waited to
go broke in the ordinary way there would have
been no business to sell, and the Colonial would
have lost the money, and there would have
been no profitable connection for the B.N.Z. to
buy, for it would have been scattered to the
winds. Everybody knew or guessed that the
Colonial wanted to sell its business because it
had been struck by somebody’s overdraft. The
sale didn’t save Ward from exposure ; in fact,
whatever the intention might be, the actual re-
sult was that it rather hurried on the exposure
by winding up the Colonial a year or so earlier
than might otherwise have happened. The
Government couldn’t well state in advance that
the Colonial wanted to sell because it was prac-
tically ruined, largely through the overdraft of
Treasurer Ward’s co„ ; while the sale was uncom-
pleted, it could hardly blast other people’s pro-
perty on the strength of information which was
more or less confidential. Apparently the whole
theory is that it shouldn’t have made a pur-
chase which has turned out very well, and
should have let the Colonial make a disastrous
smash, or should have allowed its business to
be absorbed by some foreign institution, simply
because Treasurer Ward owed it a lot of
money. Whether there was any ulterior motive
or not, the transaction was apparently con-
ducted on absolutely honest lines, and the
Colonial Bank squabble is only another evidence
of the small-mindedness and parochial character
of Maoriland politics.

Another movement, supported by Melb. Age,
has been begun to secure the coining in Aus-
tralia of all silver and bronze called for in
Australian currency. Nowadays the right is
worth having ; last year the Mint made a profit
of 117'73 per cent, on the silver coined, said
profit reaching for the year J>476,866. Half-
promises have hitherto been made ; but at that
the matter stands. The grounds taken by the
Imperial bosses are chiefly these : —Silver isn’t
a coin ;it is a token. It cannot be held as a
reserve; hence it would be dangerous to coin
beyond requirements. The Bank of England,
having its finger on the financial pulse of the
kingdom, alone knows when silver tokens are
required, and on its representation alone are
any minted. By the way, the silver minting is
pretty frequently done away from the Mint
altogether. Also by the way, there is but one
British Mint in the world ; all the rest, in
India, Australia, and elsewhere, are merely
branches of it. In Australia, silver-distribu-
tion is arranged by the Colonial Treasurers, and
not by the banks.
‘ Harry Monck,” to The Bulletin :
Although this constant yabber about Kanaka slavery in
Queensland is in some few instances not far from truth, it
is still greatly exaggerated, in the interests of a body of
men who wish for a monopolv of the islands for their own
purposes. Five years as a Govt, agent in the South Seas
convinced me that slavery and depopulation are carried
out in a most systematic manner on the islands, without
the “ boys ’ leaving their native shores. One instance :
Roats went ashore in answer to a signal-smoke. I took
off two boys, explained agreement, and signed them on
as recruits. Following morning comes a letter from mis-
sionary, demanding boys back, as I had taken them with-
out his, their parents’, or their own permission. As this
amounted to a direct charge of kidnapping, I replied that
I would retain boys, and lay his letter before Govt, on hiy
return. On investigation in Queensland, the boy's said
they had worked for missionary long periods—one over a
year and only received a few sticks of tobacco for ser-
vices. These boys thoroughly understood their Queens-
land agreement, and were only anxious to get out of mis-
sionary clutches, and gain some recompense for their work.
Again, if this slavery exists in Q., how account for the con-
stant return thither of old hands from the islands ? I have
had as many as 30 old hands amongst 70 recruits. Have
also had in one trip seven boys return at once after being
up to their villages seeing their relatives and giving away
their boxes. There is, no doubt, a high Kanaka death-
rate in Queensland, but if a census could be taken and a
death-rate struck on the missionary islands, the figures
would surprise church-goers. Two reasons for "this.
First, the missionary' has not sufficient confidence in the
God he preaches to believe that all things are for the
best, but at once proceeds to put his alleged converts
into clothes—men, shirt and trousers ; women, a sort of
dressing-gown. Latter arrangement probably from doubt
of his own innate purity in so hot a climate. The effects,
however, are disastrous to his disciples, as they never
remove the togs till they fall off (take ’em as part of the
Gospel), turning in after tropical rains and fishing on the
reefs, wringing wet, to sleep in the hot ashes strewn over
the floors of the village houses. Pneumonia, rheumatism,
and consumption are natural results. Second cause
of depopulation per missionary is that islands like
Aoba, Malo and Santo in the New Hebrides are simply
immense brothels, frequented by trading vessels and
other craft with usual results of disease and death. The
labor vessels’ crews are not offenders to any extent in
this way. The heavy bond entered into by ship-owners
against illegal traffic with natives, the sharp look-out of
the Govt, agent, and the knowledge by the crew that dis-
covery means barring-out from the trade, act as sufficient
deterrents in the majority of cases. Those islands which
are not yet missionary-ridden, and where a white man
interfering with a native woman is liable to be shot, or
tomahawked quick and lively, are not, I venture to say,
losing much population, though there may be recruiting
for Queensland going on. I think I have advanced enough
to prove that Queensland is not responsible for all the
slavery and depopulation of the South Seas. That the
boys are well looked-after in Queensland the recent en-
deavor to shift the Polynesian Inspector in Bundaberg
will prove. Fact is, there has been too much talk by
missionaries and their supporters about slavery' in
Queensland and consequent depopulation of islands, and
too little talk (of the right kind) about a body of men
whose hypocritical prudery and insane methods are
jeopardising the lives of hundreds annually in the name
of Christianity. If the pagans must be christianized, let
them be inoculated in the nude, and, if this is more
than missionary virtue can stand—well, why mission-
aries at all?

Apropos of The Bulletin’s recent statement
that the constantly bragged-about “influx”
into N.S.W. from the adjacent Protectionist
provinces is all a myth, an infuriated cor-
respondent writes to state that this paper is a
liar, and that something awful will happen to
it when it dies. By way of reply to this unduly
excited person, it tenders the following figures :
The N.S. W. statistics give no details of arrivals
or departures by sea from or to the other pro-
vinces, these being lumped in with the influx
from Europe, Asia, Africa, and America; but
it seems a fair thing to assume that the arrivals
and departures by sea will be in about the same
proportion as those overland. As regards the
overland movement, the three adjacent pro-
vinces—Victoria, S.A., and Queensland —are
reckoned in together, so it is necessary to take
them all in one lot, with the following result,
so far back as the information goes :
Arrivals Departures
Overland. Overland.
1891 ... 50,775 49,685 Gain 1090
1892 ... 62,050 62,734 Loss 684
1893 ... 45,175 49,207 „ 4032
1894 ... 42,809 45,442 „ 2633
1895 ... 52,795 57,125 „ 4330
1896 ... 68,860 57,690 Gain 1170
312,464 321,883 Loss 9419
These are the Government Statistician’s figures,
and the Registrar-General agrees with him
except as regards 1896, in which year the latter
authority declares N.S.W. lost 1801 people in-
stead of gaining 1170. But, even on the most
favorable computation, the figures are very routrli
upon the old, dreary, pig headed lie about
the “ influx ” of people from the adjacent pro-
vinces to escape from the horrors of Protection
and enjoy the blessed sunshine of Fiee-raid.
The Shoddy press of Sydney has apparently
entered into a tacit conspiracy to bolster up the
Foreign-trade system by large, copious, off-
hand statements about the wondrous prosperity
of the province. Among its pet fictions are the
Treasury surplus which the State Statistician
persistently shows as a chronic deficit ; the pro-
fitable condition of the N.S.W. railways, des-
pite the fact that the Government Auditor
shows a huge deficit against them—the largest
save one in the Seven Provinces, and one which
runs even the largest one very close ; the in-
creased revenue, which is steadily declining ;
the influx of population from the adjacent pro-
vinces, which pans out in cold figures as above ;
the steady growth of the capital, which has
13,600 less inhabitants than it had two years
ago, and a good many other things. The Free-
trade press of N.S.W. is a great deal too much
like the Chinaman, who has spent 3000 years in
considering how much greater and wiser and
more enlightened and civilised he is than any-
body else in the whole world, and who has been
left behind while he was wrapped in considera-
tion.
Brisbane Worker wickedly relates that a
letter, addressed, “Leader of Opposition—Parlia-
ment House, Brisbane,” couldn’t find a receiver
the other day.
The battle of ’9B still rages with un-
diminished force in Sydney, and the peculiarity of
it is that here, as in the “ ould dart” itself, we
have the local M'Carthyites, the local Healyites,
and the local church-party at loggerheads. The
church-party want the Irish Rebellion of 1708 to
be “ commemorated ” in the orthodox manner, the
proceeds to go towards erecting an altar in St.
Mary’s ; the M'Carthyites want Irishmen, mostly
Catholics, to “commemorate” in a moderately
sympathetic manner the efforts of misguided
patriots, and devote the proceeds of the com-
memoration, also the proceeds of St. Pat. ’s Day,
towards a Celtic Cross at Waverley ; the Healyites
maintain that it is necessary to justify '9B as a
constitutionally-proper movement, so I hat citizens
of all nationalities, classes and creeds u ho are free
to admire true patriotism, no matter by whom
shown, should be invited to “celebrate” the event

At Sydney Royal George Rignold—who
came back rather unexpectedly —has been running
“ Tommy Atkins ” with less good fortune than
that vigorous drama deserves. The point about
“Atkins ’’ which appeals to the writer’s soul is
Diver’s wicked captain, with three wives and a
scheme for marrying a fourth. And he likes
Diver especially where he goads his second un-
wedded wife to suicide, and then thoughtfully
retires so that she may drown herself without
being embarrassed by his presence. He feels that
the lady wants to drown herself, and that the river
is handy, and that he is in the way, so he remarks
that it is a nice, wet river, and that the lady will
make a beautiful corpse, and steps aside. No lady
who really wants to drown herself cares to do it
when there is a man looking, for she is liable to
come up ungracefully feet-first several times before
she is quite dead. “ Atkins ”is a realistic drama,
partly because the wicked Diver doesn’t repent
in his last moments, but dies full of gunshot and
blanky; and because the hard-hearted father
never relents at all, but tells his erring daughter
to drag her illicit infant to the ends of the earth,
and his last hope is that she will be
wet and miserable all her life; also be-
cause the curate jumps on his black coat
and enlists; while the good, mild young
man gradually falls into gin and begins to come
home incoherently at a late hour, with a lump of
mud the size of an eagle on the tails of his moral
black coat, and ask passers-by to lend him a
fresh-laid keyhole so that he can get in. Taking
one consideration with another, “ Tommy Atkins”
is a good deal out of the ordinary dramatic rut,
which is a valuable feature in its character. One
of the good points about it is Miss Lilian
Wheeler’s rendering of the bad captain’s second
wife, and one of the worst is George Rignold’s
abandonment of his old part to take up
that of the curate, formerly played by Pliinmer.
Rignold can’t look in the least like a young,
fresh curate, while Plimmer did.

Too late for notice in this issue ‘ Man to
Man,” a drama with a disastrous railway col-
lision in it, was to be produced at the Royal ;
particulars next week.
** * *
To-morrow (Friday) night King Hedley’s
wild Amurrikin horse will fall into the tank at the
Lyceum for the last time. His departure will be
regretted by many, for he was an honest, con-
scientious horse, and he went in with a mighty
splash, while King Hedley hung on to the broken
bridge with one hand, and fired at Green Bear, or
Pale Dog, or some other Indian, with the other.
There was a whole lot of hair-raising Indian in the
“ Prairie King,” and the air was full of scalp, and
Maud Williamson, in her male hunting suit, was
a very nice spectacle, and greatly run after by
Pale Cat and Blue Horse and other red men, who
wanted her to add to their harems. The fact that
she was nearly drowned in the tank the first night,
and had to be fished out, pallid and insensible,
with her wet brown hair in her mouth, helped to
advertise the drama considerably. Also, there is
room to say some kind things about Ethel
Grey’s Mexican adventuress, who wore the huge
feathered hat of a sinful life, and was somehow
or other in alliance with Pallid Mule, the Indian, in
his designs on the scalp of the King whose horse
fell into the tank.

Grattan Riggs, an almost-forgotten hero
of ye olden time, who was much in favor with
a bygone generation—the one that burst for its
many sins and drifted into gaol or the soup-
kitchen in 1893—is due at the Lyceum on
Saturday, when “ The Irish Detective” will be re-
vived. Riggs was a broguey man of might when
Australia used to know him, and as the Irish
drama has had a blessed rest of late years there
ought to be a show for both of them, if they
don’t stay too long.
** * *
Sydney Palace, which has many strange
openings and shuttings, and whose gilded portal
bangs on the heels of one disastrous enterprise
after another in amazingly quick succession, is to
try its luck again on Saturday. It starts with a
new musical comedy, of which Hoyt, of “China-
town ” celebrity, is part author, called “ Binks,
the Photographer,” and the co. includes George
Lauri, Marietta Nash, Addie Conyers, and other
good names. Therefore, if the palatial gate bangs
on the sudden exit of another frost, the chances
are that it will be “ Binks ” and not the company
that is to blame. Probably the ill-luck of the
Palace is only based on the fact that there is far
more, show in Sydney now than a very poor and
hollow city can support. Sydney shows are
divided into three classes at present: those where
business is moderate, those where it is bad, and
those where it is simply awful. One house where
it was worse than awful closed some time ago.
** * *
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, the haggard
waif with the dreadful coff is nearing his end —
in fact he is booked to cough his very last
to-night (Thursday). Taking one consideration
with another, his lingering lung has lasted longer
than this paper expected. When it first heard
him, a good nwiy weeks ago, it diagnosed him as
a dreadfully bad case, and reckoned he would
bark himself into the cemetery within seven
days, and the fact that he only expects to blow
off the last fragment of his lung to-night shows
great endurance. The Bulletin will regret this
fateful melo-shriek, for the sake of Lily
Titheradge’s fine rendering of the other vago-
bond—not the one with the expiring lung. Miss
Lily makes a nice, healthy, clever boy—a round-
faced, ordinary boy, who looks real; and the
stage boy who is a girl very seldom looks par-
ticularly real. Also it wili regret it for the
sake of the company in general, which is a
remarkably good company, and it even has a
certain sorrow at parting with the boy-girl with
the blighted lung. He looks so spectral, and
there is such a tremendous bark inside such a
very small and hazy boy, that it suggests a lion
running wild in a paper bag, and the writer has
dropped in many a night with a half-formed
expectation that the boy would burst, and the
cough come out and rush about loose on the stage.
But somehow it never happened.
« » » *
Her Majesty’s will be closed on Friday
while the management gets its superfluous clothes
off and makes ready for a great sprint with “ A
Royal Divorce” on Saturday. Napoleon will be
played as heretofore by Julius Knight, the man
who was falsely accused of having legs that were
not absolutely straight when he was an Early
Pagan in the “Sign of the Gross.” It is antici-
pated that the view of Napoleon’s motley army
trailing horribly homeward through the snows on
the frozen road from Moscow, and dropping its
toes on the road, will be a valuable hint for people
who think of going to Klondyke this winter.
Otherwise the “Royal Divorce’’ is mainly his-
tory gone mad and wild discrepancy in uniform.

The Biograpli co., which Harry Rickards
first presented at Sydney Palace, and then at the
Criterion, and which has latterly been crowded
into the Tivoli along with the regular Tivoli show,
departs this week. Still there will be enough
talent left at the latter house to keep the pro-
gramme going as usual.
* * * *
Elsie Lander, with her “Demon Gold”
company, opens at Brisbane Royal, on the 26th,
with “ Kitty, the Queen of the Mines.” In
America this piece is stated to be drawing crowded
houses—in what part of America The Bulletin
knoweth not, neither has it any idea as to the size
of the house that is alleged to be crowded, and it
knows absolutely nothing about the circumstances
of the case. Therefore the above statement may
be taken either fresh or corned. Anyhow, there
is much thrill and shock in “ Kitty,” and the co.
includes some names that the public seems to have
heard before.
* * * *
The Melb. show market is somewhat de-
pressed since the races came to an end and the
cricket-match went along to Sydney. Public
taste having grown tired and critical, “The Gay
Parisienne ” will run for only one more week, and
not several more weeks, at the Princess’s. Some
of the incidents between the songs fall very
heavily upon the tired population, especially the
mock-trial incident, which is about the saddest
specimen of libretto that ever gained admittance
to the first act of a financial success. If it were
not an essential feature of the plot the manage-
ment would, no doubt, cutout the mock trial, and
fill the gap with ballet, or any other airy irrele-
vancy, in which case “The Gay Parisienne”
might just as well be played backwards on alter-
nate evenings. The performers continue to do
their best for this fragile musical farce, and the
announcement of last nights excites new interest
in the dresses, and scenery, and general fittings of
a payable concern.
* * * *
At Melb. Royal, the bill seems to undergo
a more or less decided change every Saturday.
The present drama is “ Arrah-na-Pogue,” which,
in its old age, depends a good deal upon Maggie
Moore’s broad, effective treatment of “ Wearing
of the Green.” All the other points of Bouei-
cault’s long-lived narrative have lost their early
freshness. The heroic rebel who lurks in the hay-
loft, and the gallant O’Grady, and the crouching
informer, and the finest pisantry in the wurrld
are all of them less new and original than they
used to be. Likewise the bloodthirsty British
major, and the broth of a bhoy who would lay
down his life for the young master, and Patsey,
and Tim, and the faction-fight, are institutions
that begin to pall upon representatives of the
press as time rolls on. But “ The Wearing of the
Green ” has the same old thrill in it when Maggie
Moore turns her soul full on at the meter, and for
the sake of that traysonable ballad-singer The
Bulletin looks kindly at “ Arrah-no-PogUe,” not-
withstanding sundry shortcomings in the tail-end
of the production.
* * * *
At the Opera House somebody, no doubt,
will be coming along to console people for the tem-
porary loss of Wootwell, a joyous, unconventional
humorist, who constructs absurd songs to suit
himself, and is altogether amusing, as a rule. The
vertical pole people depart from Australia this
week, leaving a space for the “ Matchless Luci-
fers.” Silence reigns once more at the Alexandra,
and the Bell Ringers have duly retired from the
Athenseum Hall with a profit, but Cosgrove’s
hopeless co. still struggles along at the Cambridge
for want of something better to do elsewhere.
* * * *
It appears that the Gladstone Wright
Concert Direction, or bureau, or whatever the
Grand Old Man’s distant relative may call him-
self in his business capacity, has secured the Xmas
holiday dates at Melb. Exhibition Building, and
intends to fix up some concerts on a scale of un-
rivalled, &c., &c. The Xmas dates have, of late
years, always been plums for W. J. Turner, who
gave very respectable concerts in a rather rough
style. If the new management wants to shine
it had better start by scrubbing the floor and
putting a little bit of frill on the proceedings.
* * **
Melb. Bijou—as was stated in last week’s
Bulletin —will re-open on Saturday with a
Rickards entertainment differing in character
from the perennial show at the Opera House.
Several of the names on the bill, including the
Biograph, are quite new to Melbourne, whilst
some of the others, such as Phil Newbury and
Miss Lilian Tree, are dear to memory. Also, the
prices are popular, and seeing that the Bijou is
the best of ‘‘pitches ” for a variety-cwm-concert
eo., the season should hum.
At Poverty Point.
“ Colborne-Baber, who has had a few good chances in
London, pines for the sun of Sydney,” writes a Bulletin
correspondent from London. “ Lardelli seems to be
doing better since he moved to Eastbourne, where he has
the advantage of family connections. Beatrice Griffiths
played for Hugo Gorlitz, at Steinway Hall, to-day (8/10,97),
which means that there is a likelihood of her meeting
Paderewski—now shorn of his locks.”
“Ada Crossley sang in ‘ Elijah,’at the opening of the
great Birmingham Musical Festival, on Tuesday last,”
writes a Bulletin correspondent by last mail, “ the soul-
ful Wagnerian, Madame Marie Brema, singing second to
the Gippslander. Albani, Edward Lloyd, and Andrew
Black were the other principals. Twenty-four critics and
hundreds of musical enthusiasts went down from London
for the occasion, and from the press Ada got stacks of
praise. Hundreds of people were unable to secure seats
for ‘ Elijah,’ no less than 120 applicants being ‘ out’ at the
first ballot for places. Albani, who embraced the Cross-
ley at the Chelsea Barracks Colonial Concert, a couple of
months ago, followed that overture by an offer for the
Canadian’s Australia tour. A.C. wasn’t ‘ taking any,’ and
prefers the prospect of doing Australia ‘on her own.’ She
went to Paris for her Birmingham Festival frocks, and
looked truly chic in them.”
Kowalski is back in London after a successful concert-
tour in France. There is a possibility of his returning to
Australia in two years. He is now engaged on a comic
opera on a Greek subject, with a French libretto.
Flora Graupner, under the gn y skies of London, is not
recognisable as the mercurial little fairy of Austral comic
opera. The Bulletin regrets to hear Flora seems in-
clined to melancholy.
While Melba tours the English provinces her young
sister remains in Paris to learn French. The brother,
Ernest Mitchell, is studying composition in Paris with
Joachim, the phenomenal voice not having come up to
anticipation. Joachim has a niece in London who devotes
herself to German diction, and at her Tuesdays during
the season one meets crowds of Australians.
From London : “Mrs. Potterand Kyrle live in a charm-
ing place, Blenheim House, St. John’s Wood, where they
are ‘at home ’ every Sunday afternoon. Even before the
most intimate friends they address each other as ‘ Mrs.
Potter’ and ‘Mr. Bellew.’ The latter’s father was in-
cumbent of St. Mark’s Church, which stands quite near
to their Abbey Road home. At the present moment Cora
is about equally dividing her interest between the London
critics —who were really nice to her—and the fluctuations
in the Mt. Lyell market. She bought Mount Lyells at
£6.”
Bertha Rossow gets a show at the first of Vert’s three
morning-concerts at St. James’s Hall. If they go, Vert
will inaugurate a series in opposition to Boosey, who trod
on his corns. The rival contraltos, Ada Crossley and
Clara Butt, sing together at the first of the new Boosev
Ballad concerts.
Notes and small change, from an Australian globe-
trotter : “ Tom Haydon, for so many years secretary of the
V.R.C. is writing a book entitled ‘ Sporting Reminis-
cences ’ for Bliss, Sands and Co., who are so satisfied with
the advance sheets they have paid a good price down.
The old-’un is going strong, and is as popular as ever.
Miss Ethel is not at present too well, the monotony and
whirl of two much ‘ Circus Girl ’ easily accounts for that.
The much-aspersed Australian ‘ ham-fat ’ A. G. Paulton
has done well in his first engagement—‘La Perichole’—
being hailed as ‘ a clever young actor,’ though it is to be
hoped his success will not depopulate Poverty Point.
Miss Pattie Browne, in ‘ White Heather,’ at Drury Lane,
does well, and, with all respect to an English provincial
paper, looks well. The ‘ atrocious rag,’ with more
audacity than decency, says, ‘ In the cycling scene Miss
Pattie B. wears a rational suit of white serge, and looks
extremely nice in it so long as she stands up wit h her face
to the audience. But any change of position seems fatal
to grace.’ Which means— — ”
Mascagni, composer of “ Cavalleria Rusticana,” lately
made a more or less genuine attempt to commit suicide.
His one famous opera, created him the hero of the hour ;
then came comparative failures and loss of celebrity, and
the genius who had been happy enough as an unknown
struggler, began to think that life wasn’t worth living.
Business at London Duke of York’s has been improving,
The Bulletin hears. After the first week Musgrove de-
cided to sell the lease, but matters changed for the better
in a day or two, and he refused the offer and pluckily
resolved to hold on. As far as “ Francillon ” goes, it is to
the play, not the players, that the London people object.
Some members of the cast are decidedly antagonistic to
Mrs. Potter, for all that.
Tom Fitzgerald, of circus fame, told a friend of
the writer's last week that his firm had cleared over £BOOO
by their show in the West, during the last five months.
Henry Bracy starts the “ Beggar Student ” at Bendigo,
under the MacMahon management, and is going to run a
season of provincial opera. Bracy is a good actor and a
good singer, and looks gorgeous in his Polish togs, but
owing to something—probably the want of hard business
instinct—his own attempts at management didn’t make
him absolutely a billionaire. In fact rumor has it that it
only required six men to carry the profits home after his
Melbourne season.
The marks of the feet of the critics are deep on the
otherwise beautiful cuticle of Mrs. 8.-Potter. William
Archer said the nastiest things possible. Then A. B.
Walkley in the Speaker : “ She gives us a mincing,
affected minx without a shed of dignity, or any sign by
which Francillon is to be distinguished from the very
type of woman for whom she was deserted by her hus-
band. She talks of her matronly instincts, but we notice
the audacity of her dicolletage.” Likewise George Ber-
nard Shaw in the Sat. Review : “ She seems, as far as I
can judge, congenitally incapable of a genuine impersona-
tion. But she has coached herself into a capital imitation
of a real French actress playing the part, which she
thoroughly understands. Saving one or two lapses into
clowning for provincial laughs, her performance is not a
bad specimen of manufactured acting.”
“ ‘ A Marriage of Convenience,’ at Haymarket Theatre,
is a most, effective little play, with excellent situations,
bright dialogue, and picturesque dresses (period, Louis
Quinze),” writes a Bulletin man from London. “ The
story turns on the parties to a mariage de convenance
falling in love with each other after marriage. There are
but two women in it, played by Winifred Emery and
Adrienne Dairolles, the former a consummate comedienne,
and the latter a clever French soubrette, who speaks
English very well. Mr. Cyril Maude is a comedian who
would be appreciated in Australia—quiet, refined, yet
effective to the last degree. The theatre is perfect,
orchestra hidden, yet perfectly audible; no horrible
tuning of instruments ; at the appointed hour the music
just begins; no bells rung, or beams bumped on the floor
—when the music ends the curtain simply goes up, and
the play starts ; programmes free, no shrill-voiced people
selling ‘book-o’-th’-something-or-other.’ Altogether no
friction or nerve worry. It was delightful.”
An Australian Abroad : “ Met Ellen Terry at Boulogne,
the other day, in a cab, with a great poke bonnet, hu ,|r e
goggles on her eyes (she suffers terribly with her eyes,
poor thing), and a gigantic cauliflower in her hand, which
she was taking back to Folkestone with her. She was over
for a day’s rest while the company was at Eastbourne.
Premier Reid slangwhanged Lyne for
taking advice on the Financial Statement from an
outside financial authority: “ Why did you not
go to the Auditor-General instead of to this
precious city-accountant?” yelled the new P.O.
But, only a Parliament or so ago, Reid presented
to the House a statement from three private
bankers, supposed to be corroborative of one of
his previous financial statements; and, when
asked why he had not used the services of Govern-
ment officials, retorted that he took the course any
honorable man should take.
Louis Staunton, of Penge mystery (alleged
woman-starving) notoriety, having completed his
20 years imprisonment, is coming to Australia
under his own name, because lie says he has
nothing whatever to hide or to be ashamed of.
The omission from Sydney Daily Tele-
graph of any report of the now-celebrated Naran-
dera child-flogging case, was, it now transpires,
caused by the negligence of their local correspon-
dent, with whose services, The Bulletin is in-
formed, the paper has dispensed.
The vital point in the amended regulations
for prevention of smuggling and illegal whisky
milling in N.S.W. is that, whereas the informer
had formerly to depend for reward upon a share of
any money-penalty that might be paid, he will
now, in addition, be secure of a fixed remunera-
tion, even where the offender elects to take it out.
The alteration should be a death-blow to the
private still.
The present session of Bananaland Parlia-
ment has been about the dullest on record —even
after making allowance for the antics of Mat.
Battersby. Government supporters outside com-
plain of the masterly inactivity of the Tozer
regime ; Labor-men and democrats growl because
they never seem to get any “ forrarder ”; and the
public at large wants to know what harm would
be done if the Palaver House were shut up alto-
gether.
Explorer Ernest Giles, wlio died the other
day at Coolgardie in very poor circumstances, is
—so the telegraph-man alleges—to have a costly
State funeral. When he was alive, the same
W.A. Government gave him a billet in an office
at =£lso a year—equal to about 355. a week in
Sydney or Melbourne. The S.A. Government
went one better, and gave him nothing at all, yet
Giles did a lot to open up these two provinces in
the old days.
The Maoriland Old Age Pension scheme is
getting fairly afloat. By way of a beginning, the
Government proposes to grant an allowance of
<£lB a year to the venerable inhabitant of 65 or
upwards whose income is less than £36 per
annum. It is a very small beginning certainly,
but better things may come of it later on, and
meanwhile his 30s. per month will enable the very
ancient patriarch to die a little more decently
than heretofore.
With reference to a paragraph in our issue
of October 16, relating to the marriage of Mr.
Muddit Allie, a Hindoo licensed hawker, well and
favorably known in the Moama district of N.S. W.,
The Bulletin learns with regret that certain
statements therein contained are totally incorrect.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Muddit Allie was married
by a Church of England clergyman at Rochester '
(Vic.), and his honeymoon was spent at the resi-
dence of a respected citizen of Carlton (Vic.). The
statement regarding police enquiries is quite un-
true. Mr. Muddit Allie has been a resident of
N.S. Wales for upwards of six years, and The
Bulletin is assured that both in business and
privately he bears an irreproachable reputation.
N.S.W. Marine Board decides that Piggy
had to save the Kameruka passengers because the
skipper was drunk; and that officer and another
—who is alleged not to have taken proper steps
to save the vessel—are called upon to show cause,
&c. Considering that, if the other officer had
bearded the captain, Things would have Hap-
pened—possibly he would have lost his billet—that
individual seems to have been in a mighty tight
place. It’s the story of the lost victoria
over again—a cat jumping to perdition while the
mice ponder how on earth to hang the bell round
her neck. Incidentally the Marine Board—not
reformed yet, by the way—“deprecated” the
look-out man being taken away to get ashes up!
If the Marine Board is really as green as it looks,
it probably does not know that there is hardly one
small steamer on the coast whose look-out man is
where he ought to be all the year round and all
night through.
The principal Yic. missionary of the Bible-
in-Schools party invariably informs his audience
of flabby pietists that the reason why it would be
“most unfair” to leave the Bible question to a
referendum is that “we have not time to educate
the people up to our standard of thought.” Then
the dear brethren, with the soulful desire for
things spiritual gleaming in their eyes, and a yearn-
ing for the next bun-struggle gnawing at their
innards, whack the floor hard with the gamp of
faith in token of approval. Yet it is difficult to
see what the bun-crowd has to complain of. It
had the people educated up to its standard for
many years, and it foolishly let them slide down
again—or slide up, whichever it may be. And, as
to not having time to educate them up again, it
has all the time there is. And if all the time
God has made isn’t time enough for it, how much
time does it want ?

The slump in the N.S.W. revenue goes on con-
tinuously. For October the receipts were £704,285, or
a fall of £54,382 as compared with Oc f ., 1896. For the
first four months of the present financial year the re-
venue was £2,819,458 or £220,640 less than the revenue
for the four corresponding- months of last year. Premier
Reid estimated that this year’s revenue would be £40,000
more than last year's, and as a-third of the year is now
past, and instead of an increase there is a huge drop, the
Treasury has a lot of leeway to make up. The expendi-
ture up to date is £3,221,984, so the deficit is already
£402,526. Last year at the same date the deficit was only
£262,368, so in this respect also things are a lot worse
than they were in 1896. The 1896 revenue was less than
that for 1895 mainly through the abolition of Customs
duties, which at least furnished a decent explanation of
that particular falling-off. The 1897 revenue is so
far less than that for 1896 because there is a
slump in income - tax, customs, railway revenue,
tramway revenue, land revenue, school fees, water
and sewerage receipts, and miscellaneous takings—in
fact, there is a drop almost everywhere signify-
ing all-round depression. Under these painful conditions
the affable bungler who promised that his Freetrade
policy would make N.S.W. jolly and fat is engaged in
desperate efforts to avert yet another deficit. New
taxation on a large scale is promised, and the old policy
of charging ordinary expenditure to loans i 3 going ahead
more vigorously than ever. The outlay charged against
revenue in the last four months is £80,482 less than that
for the corresponding four months of 1896, and the out-
lay charged against loan funds is £88,706 more. The
beautiful similarity of these two sums is interesting. In all
these provinces there is no law to define what may or
may not be legally charged to loans; an unscrupulous
Treasurer with a good majority behind him may debit
any darned thing he likes to posterity so as to make his
accounts look decently square. And G. Reid is a genius
at this sort of work.

The Reid Government proposes to economise
some more by hacking another slice off the road and
bridge vote. The following are the amounts paid out of
revenue by various recent Governments under this head ;
1890 Parkes ... £805,309
1891 „ ... 997,678
1892 Dibbs ... 889,633
1893 „ ... 706,563
1894-5 (1| year) Reid £830,654, or
per annum ... 553,770
1896 „ ... 666,863
1897 (estimate) ~ ... 550,000
The saving is partly effected by letting things slide and
mostly by shunting expenditure into loan account.
Premier Reid had the gall to bitterly accuse his predeces-
sor of starving the road and bridge vote to make a bogus
surplus. Yet, no one of late years ever starved this vote
as Reid himself has done. As a rule, when Reid accuses
anybody of doing anything it is a fair assumption that the
other fellow didn’t do it and that Reid did it himself.

The splendid upward movement in the Victorian
revenue struck a very bad snag in October. For the first
quarter of the financial year the income was £39,857
ahead of the corresponding quarter of 1896. Then
October showed a fall of £46,525 as compared with
October, 1896, which leaves Turner £6668 worse for the
four months than he was at the same date 12 months ago.
That sound in the distance like a stampede of wild oxen
is the Knight of St. Hilda jumping on the glossy hat he
bought in London.
* * * *
Last year Premier Turner gave notice of his
intention to convert £2,250,000 of Victorian 4 per cent,
stock into 3 per cents., thus saving £ 22,500 a year inter-
est. All of it save £120,000 worth has since been con-
verted, and, by way of raising the money to pay off
this little remnant of the old stock, Turner proposes
to float a loan of £120,000 in Melbourne at 3 per cent,
with a minimum, it is alleged, of £lO2 10s. If he succeeds
it will be a great operation ; no Government has ever .yet
got over £lOO for 3 per cent, stock in Australia, and very
few have got that. Still, as the Vic. 3 per cents, are now
selling at £lO3 10s. in Melbourne (now-a-days one must
have a heap of money to be able with perfect safety to
cease work) it seems certain that there will be no diffi-
culty in getting £lo2los. for the new issue. Most of the
Victorian 4 per cents, were floated in the days of Duncan
Gillies’s boom, and the biggest part of them, unluckily,
don’t fall due till between 1913 and 1920. Considering
that the money could be got now at 3 per cent, if these
awful securities were only convertible, this is a truly
pleasant thing to look forward to. Victoria now pays on
its whole public debt £430,000 a year more than the pre-
sent market rate—which is a considerable price to pay for
defunct booms.
* * * •
The Vic. State Land Bank’s latest issue of 3 per
cent, bonds ( £18,100) only induced the public to subscribe
£775, the Savings Bank, as usual, taking the balance at
par. Evidently there is something wrong with the
arrangements. The Government’s 3 per cent, securities
are worth £lO3 10s. in the open market; the 3 per cents,
of the State Land Bank, which should be about as good
security, are almost unsaleable at £lOO. Probably the
whole trouble lies in the fact that the latter are repayable
at any time, while the former have a fixed currency. The
public doesn’t yearn after an investment which is liable
to hand the money back at any moment. By-and-bye
though the date is still far ahead—the Savings Bank will
have taken all the Land Bank bonds it can hold, and then
it will be absolutely necessary to give the latter a fixed
currency of 20 years or so to induce the public to put its
money in them.

Queensland revenue for October (.£279,225) was
£12,619 less than that for Oct., 1896, and for the four
months of the financial year that have already elapsed
the receipts are fully £86,000 less than for the corres-
ponding four months of 1896. Consequently, things look
very, very blue for the Nelson-Byrnes-Tozer combination
and the worst-mortgaged of all the Seven Provinces
appears to be slithering rapidly to perdition.
* * * *
Tasmania’s revenue for October (£88,051) is an
increase of £8044 on that for Oct., 1896, and, with 10
months of the financial year gone, the receipts are now
£32,380 better than they were at the same date last year.
Westralia’s revenue for October (=£219,706) is
£35,040 more than for Oct., last year. Up to the end of
Sept., there was a decline of £25,821, but the unexpected
boom of October leaves things £9219 better for the four
months.
• • * •
The boom in A. J.S. Bank shares departed al-
most as suddenly as it arrived. In August, these shares
(£7 10s., paid up) sold at 2s. 9d. In October they hustled
up gaily to Bs. 9d. and by the 15th November they were
quoted sellers, ss. ; buyers, 3s. 6d. At the latter date, 4J
months of the half-year were gone, and about that time a
vague impression generally gets loose in the atmosphere
as to how the balance-sheet is going to turn out. The
.mpression for the moment is, apparently, that it will
turn out not too well. As The Bulletin pointed out last
half-year, when the appalling loss of £53,000 was an-
nounced, the reduction of deposit interest wasn’t nearly
sufficient to cover the gap, and the only things which
seemed likely to put the A. J.S. straight were some good
seasons, good wool prices, a revival of business, and a
general looking up of things. And, judging by that
usually reliable barometer, the State revenue, instead of
looking up things are, so far, remaining down “ some-
thing awful.”

Premier Nelson has taken decisive action in the
matter of the Q.N.B. report and the Gentleman Who is
Away. The investigation committee-men mildly pro-
posed that the Government should give them £2OOO or
£3OOO so that they might take a trip to Europe and per-
sonally examine MTlwraith in his flowery haunt at
Heidelberg, the matter being indefinitely hung up mean-
while. _ Nelson instead got a resolution through the
House indemnif3’ing the committee from any legal conse-
quences which might ensue through the fury of the
Gentleman Who Is Away or any other person, and
directed it to send in its report straightway, merely
indicating what passages were to be taken with a grain
of salt pending any possible explanations from the
eminent and wrathful absentee in Germany. So there
should be some light upon the Q.N.B. mystery shortly.

The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. made a profit
of £85,301 for the half-year just ended, which is about its
usual figure, and pays away £85,100 in a 10 per cent,
dividend. All the same, there seems to be some bad
trouble ahead for this big' and hitherto prosperous con-
cern. It reckons that its N.S.W. business will close in
1899, as by that time the progressive reduction of the
sugar-duty will have about extinguished the cornstalk
cane industry. Then it will have to sell its N.S.W. mills
and land for what they will fetch, and remove its
machinery, or, if that weighty property won’t stand the
cost of taking down, freight, and re-erection, sell the
latter for old metal; and the chairman alleges that the
loss will be something like £450,000. As the co. has only
£419,000 of reserves with which to meet this loss,
it seems likely to make a big inroad on capital,
and if Chairman Knox is really serious in his estimate,
the Colonial Sugar Co. needs to cut its dividend down to
7 per cent, or less—s per cent, would be better—and start
preparing for the wrath to come. For a co. which sees
all its reserves and apparently part of its capital on the
verge of going bung to pay away practically all its profits
in a 10 per cent, dividend looks like raging insanity.
The United Insurance Co. (Sydney) shows a
profit of £9952 for the year ending 30th Sept., as against
£11,466 last year and £10,668 in 1895, so, though the profit
is very handsome, it is hardly so good as it used to be. A
12J£ per cent, dividend absorbs £8528 ; £lOOO is added to
reserve, making it £54,000 ; and the remainder, with the
previous balance, leaves £10,576 to carry forward. The
United has also a re-insurance reserve of £12,500 ; a re-
serve of £2OOO for equalisation of dividends ; and one of
£lO,OOO to cover possible depreciation of investments,
making £89,076 of accumulations in all; and its solidity
seems beyond all question.

The Householders’ Co-operative Stores, Limited,
now being floated in Sydney, should fill a big want. The
city has already one prosperous co-operative institution,
the Civil Service society, but it deals almost solely in
eatables and drinkables. The new concern is to include
not only these but also meat, fowl, fruit, the unobtrusive
cauliflower, pastry, crockery, cutlery, bedsteads and
bedding, linen, coal and wood, tobacco, music, &c., and
to be, as nearly as possible, a universal providery. It
has secured a huge, six-storey warehouse adjacent to
Sydney G.P.0., and the only thing required to make it a
very huge success is good management and a reasonable
amount of luck.

The Sydney Lager-bier Brewing Co. Limited
(capital £80,000) expects to be in full blast during the ensu-
ing hot weather. The co. will no doubt have the blessing of
the other breweries, but its promoters look to finding a
field of their own in a huge family trade, instead of cut-
throating with the “tangle” factories. The new beer,
for which there is surely a huge opening, will contain no
more than 3.10 percent, alcohol, and will be sold bottled
at about 6s. per doz.; in small barrels fitted with syphons
it will be vended at about 6s. per 2L(gals.

Melb.’s Manchester-lane is distraught with a
huge supposed Customs fraud. Such a wide frontier line
of judgment is necessarily allowed to officials that there
is a perpetual fight between softgoods houses to steal a
point without actual dishonesty, the exact range of which
is most difficult to define. Much depends on valuation
and tricky invoicing. An official may possibly be in the
swim, as alleged at present, but consider how difficult is
appraising when a bonnet may be worth two guineas this
summer and 2s. the next. Look again at the advantage
gained by a firm that sneaks in a big line and spreads it,
at a cutting price, all over Victoria with its commercial
travellers.

A certain business man had the misfortune, a
few years ago, to be robbed of £4Boin gold and notes, the
proceeds of the sale of his stock to a stranger whom he
had met casually in the street, but whose name or address
he could not recollect. The poor victim, of course, had
to meet his creditors, who accepted 2s. 6d. in the £. How
misfortune runs in some families is shown by the afore-
said victim’s brother having been robbed lately of
£260 in almost the same way, and his brother-in-law, the
day afUr, having been burned out and his books and cash
destroyed entirely. Their unfortunate coincidences are
arousing much sympathy in certain circles, and it is
anticipated that something practical will be done for the
two unfortunate creditors at the meetings this week.

Dominion James’s disinclination to file his
shovel led to a warrant of attachment for contempt being
issued last week. The £l7 creditor refused settlement of
his claim in full, and fainted in court when the warrant
was issued. There seems to be a great deal more in
James’s coyness and his bitter attack on the Judge, than
meets the eye. The real facts of the case would make
interesting reading indeed.
Yvon ‘N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley, in
reply to a deputation the other day, said that he was in
favor of shortening- the time allowed for pleading in
actions for debt and simple contract, but did not approve
of verifying pleas on oath. Of course, the adoption of
the latter course would mean the abolition of the present
technical system of common-law pleading now obsolete in
England and in all the Australias but N.S.W., which
stands alone in its adherence to this absurdity of the
past. The difference between the old system and the new
is simply that in the latter a man may state his cause of
action or his defence fully and in plain language ; and it
is a plan which, in N.S.W. Equity Court, has always
worked satisfactorily. Under the other you must couch
your claim in highly technical formulae—in which, if you
make the slightest error, you are liable to be bowled over
by a demurrer or something. Also, your pleas or answers
to the declaration must strictly conform to artificial and
antiquated rules. Instead of saying what you have got to
say in short, you must answer non-assumpsit, nunqvam
indebitatus, or some such impossible gibberish. N.S.W.
is only behind England and the other Australias in
this important matter because she has not yet got rid
of the superstition that law can’t be good unless it’s unin-
telligible.”

Genial “Jacob,” the stalwart Dane who fell

house when the boyish exchange-clerks entered with their
bags, not to escape again till everything was balanced.
The lads, impatient to get away, often tried to slip past,
but the door-keeper was a match for any number of them,
and in consequence had come to be regarded by budding
bankers as something of a Herculean hero.

The American-cwm-French silvermen’s proposals
to England looked cheeky enough ; but no doubt much
reliance was placed on the unrest in India. At the
middle of August London Daily Telesrapii, apropos
something else altogether, said : —“ Amongst some of the
most loyal and influential of our Indian subjects there is
a very strong feeling of dissatisfaction resulting from the
persistent fall in the price of the metal in which the
savings of the people are invested. . . We as a nation
cannot afford to ignore the fact that the native losses,
with silver at its present depreciated level, must be enor-
mous, and that discontent was bound to show itself in the
country sooner or later. The wonder is that it has not
maJ° itself evident before.”
Klondyke perjury from London papers (which
for once are more sensational than the ’Murkan): —“ The
town (Dawson city) is horribly dirty, and typhoid pre-
vails. The doctors are kept busy’; they charge £4O

W. H. Clarke, described as “a prominent busi-

estimated. Roads now closed for six months.” Also, G.
R. Fearb.v, the well-remembered Coolgardie mining man,
is back from ’Murka, though he didn’t go to the new
rush. But he says he saw parcels of from 101 b. to 301 b.
weight, which, like other Canadian gold, was worth only
about £2 14s. per oz., as it carried much silver.

The day is coming evidently when “ baby
batteries will no longer monkey with the mother-lode ”in
Cobar, and Premier Reid’s statement that there is plenty
of local capital awaiting investment in N.S.W. mines will
be verified or disproved. The prospectus of the Cobar
Chesney Copper and Gold Mining Co. shows that a work-
ing capital of £65,000 will be knocked out of a total
capital of £200,000, of which £lOO,OOO is offered for sub-
scription in Australia. This mine, Melbourne-managed
for the past eight years, has been a frost to the extent of
some £25,000 having been dribbled away without any
results, save to leave the property in some sort of shape
for the future proprietors. The recognition that that
which Callahan, general manager of Lake View Consols,
called “ the mother-lode of N.S.W. ” is a huge gold and
copper lode underlying gold-bearing gossan, and that
these distinct classes of ore should be treated together by
smelting is a radical departure from the old system of tin-
pot batteries alone. Trewenack’s (of Lake George) report
is very sanguine, and is, perhaps, the more reliable in
that he and W. J. Collins, late manager of the Wentworth
Proprietary, made an unsuccessful effort to secure the
property Randolph Adams, late of the Sulphide Cor-
poration’s Broken Hill Central mine, is equally certain of
future profits. Thomas Longworth, one of the successful
tributors of the Great Cobar mine, and the manager of
that property, is convinced that the Chesney lode is the
same as that he is so successfully working, and predicts a
successful future if properly handled. Louis Janin, jr.,
who has made several examinations, predicts that a profit
of £90,000 a year will be earned on the scheme proposed.
The prospectus of this company occupies page 28 of this
week’s Bulletin.

N.S.W. Premier Reid has got into a tight
corner by saying N.S.W. mines were independent of
British capital, that for good mines plenty of money was
available within the province, and that they all knew the
sort of mines usually floated in London as well as the sort
of men who generally took them there. A wild whoop has
gone up from the N.S.W. Chamber of Mines, and several
Bull representatives are shrieking' for retractation,
an( * other things from the Premier. That part
of the Premier’s declaration referring to men and mines
is gospel truth, and in accord with what The Bulletin
has preached for years. If the Premier will promise to
make use of it for the good of the mining industry, the
writer will furnish him with a list of N.S.W. mines floated
in London, also of the bounders who floated them. Alto-
gether some hundreds of thousands were paid in cash to
the promoters ; hundreds of thousands of working capital
have since been spent in machinery and development on
the mines, but not one of this list, ever paid a shilling in
divs., and several have long been closed down. Others
are languishing from the want of gold in them-or in
London. One or two of the promoters are dead, others
w ■ en " a ' e( l ' n the business ; none are in gaol.
JN.b. YV. is not alone in the business of taking Bull down
with mines whenever an opportunity offers. Victoria,
Queensland, Maoriland, and, above all, Westralia, have
done likewise. S.A.—not so much, not having had a
chance. And as long as Bull is willing- to be swindled
Australia will remain loyal. The National Anthem—
please.

Gundagai (N.S.W.) :—“ Machinery totalling
about 300 tons is coming by special train from Victoria
for Booth s United gold-mines. It was recently placed
on the Melb. market, when all the shares were taken up
in a few hours. It is now understood that an offer has
been cabled from London offering £60,000 cash and
60,000 fully-paid shares for the property as it now stands,
with £20,000 working capital.” If so, N.S.W. mining is
looking up in London, with a vengeance.
Watch for a movement in B.H. Norths —not
immediately, perhaps, but shortly. The theory that the
mine gets the continuation of the Junction shoot is being
promulgated again, and there is talk of a new deep shaft
being put down to tap it.

paying ore; recent prospecting hasn’t helped it on much.
The workings in this mine are, measured along the out-
crop, a mile and five chains from Block 12 of the
B. Prop., where the fire is ; yet. the South men were, in
the first week in November, driven out of the deep work-
ing's by a heavy flow of water, which it must be sup-
posed comes from the floods still being poured on the fire
which was “ practically out” two months ago. Certainly
the fire isn’t gaining; but it is still costing a pretty penny
to keep it under control.

N.S.W. Govt. Geologist Pittman, before W.A.
Mining Commission : He had no doubt the supplv of water
in the mines would diminish. The experience of all mining
districts pointed to that. He did not think there was the
faintest possibility of an artesian supply. He considered
the Kalgoorlie lodes were really auriferous dvkes, but he
was distinctly favorable to the opinion that they would
live in depth. From samples of Kanowna cement he had
seen in Sydney, he then thought it was sedimentary rock
or desert sandstone, but, since inspecting the deposit, he
admitted that he was quite wrong. It was a mineral de-
posit, and there was a great probability that large deposits
of deep alluvial gold would be found in the near future
about the fields. The prospectors, so far, had only
scratched over the surface—had been working false-
bottoms, in fact—and he would be greatly surprised if the
finding of deep-leads at Kanowna was not repeated in
other places, for there they had the facts and evidence of
deep alluvial mining.

Kalgoorlie wire: “Rumored that a very rich
strike has been made at Reison’s Reward, one of the Pad-
dington Consols mines floated by Mr. Kaufman. No
official information is available, but it is said that the lode
is rich in free gold, besides massive sulphides. Mr.
Kaufman’s luck is so good that the Wealth of Nations is
now a rich mine, but without water.” When were the
public ever told that the Wealth of Expectations was any-
thing else but a marvellously rich mine? Why lias it
been made poor—to attribute' its richness to Kaufman's
luck? Surely if Kaufman’s luck puts gold in all the
mines he handles it ought not to stop at water ; hence
the writer now expects to hear that the Wealth of Nations
has been flooded to such an extent as to wash all the ore
away, leaving nothing but the pure gold behind, and to
hear the incident attributed to Kaufman’s luck.

The Coolgardie correspondent of the Mining
Standard “ Bayley’s Consols battery starts this week,
with a large supply of payable ore in sight. This mine
should give its holders good returns before Christmas.”
Yes! Under 7dwt,s. to the ton. “Londonderry: With a
good supply of water and plenty of batterv-power, it will
yet give a good return to the holders.” Hitherto, there
has been an idea that a supply of gold was wanted to give
a good return to the holders, inasmuch as it takes a
10,000 oz. cake to pay one little shilling div. ! “ The White
Feather Reward has cleaned 430 tons, giving a return of
2400 z. With a strong body of stone and the new battery
almost ready, this mine will soon be among the dividend-
payers.” Great Scott! It has been crushing over two
years, and failing to pay divs. on l£oz. stone, of which it
crushed many hundreds of tons. How is it going to pay
at SOZ. ? “ The Golden Bar still continues the same con-
sistent returns.” Then follows an apology for avery poor
return. Calls are the most consistent thing about the
Golden Bar. There are other similar pars., but enough
have been quoted to show how well-trained this gent, is to
represent a mining journal.

Declared by a Westralian paper that there are

Wigs or no wigs is likely soon to be a
keenly-debated question in N.S.W. Supreme
Court. One Judge has said that he will go in his
own hair while the hot weather lasts, and the
example is sure to be followed by a batch of coun-
sel. “But,” asks another Judge, “ where will
the innovation stop?” The cautious man has
evidently been terrified by a glimpse of the Full
Court sitting in its undershirt.

The difference of opinion among N.S.W.
Judges as to whether they can, under the local
law, hear divorce cases in camera, or with such
studied pre-arrangements as amount to in camera,
will get an airing soon, as the so : divorced wife of
an influential politician has determined to apply
for alimony, holding that the court proceedings
were null and void and that her status as wife is
still legally unimpaired.
CRICKET IN CHURCH.
(In some of the Anglican churches about Sydney the numbers of the hymns are displayed in large figures
on cards on the wall.)
TOM (just awaking from, a mild night mare in which he dreams that the Australian XI. are
playing All England XI., and that six of them are out for Iff —to his wife): “Ah,
that’s better! Who made the 112, my dear —Gregory or Giffen?”
Were a public register (similar to that
which records the names of the regular police)
kept of the names of the informers in the secret
pay of the Vic. detectives, not a few fashionable
gentlemen in society, who are supposed to have
“ private means,” would lack the many invitations
to dances, &c., with which they are now favored.

A certain private lady detective, in answer
to an advt. a little while ago, called upon a lady,
who offered her liberal terms to watch her hus-
band and find out why he did not come home very
regularly. The next morning the d., as instructed,
waited near the lady’s house to identify the man
she was to watch. That job was never completed,
inasmuch as a moment’s view of the hubby re-
vealed to the d. the fact that he was the gentleman
under whose protection the lady d. was then living
and had been living for a year.

Member : “ The decadence of certain
bong-tong Melb. public-schools was strikingly illus-
trated at the England v. Vic. match, when the
members’-reserve was infested with a swarm of
youths from the ‘ highest-class ’ schools. The
blasphemous and bestial yarns and conversation of
most of them —particularly of one gang who sat in
the pavilion taking little or no notice of the play-
shocked and disgusted all within reach of their
loud and unlovely voices. And they wore the
colors of their several schools, and bellowed out
teachers’names, in order, presumably, to advertise
their superior education ! ”

One Australian Governor bars races and
the theatre—his penchant is concerts of the
“ Messiah ” order. H.E. and family roll up re-
ligiously to orchestral shows- and though they
“ never part,” they are always saluted with “ God
Save the Queen ’’—the audience standing like
dumb-dog sycophants. Not content with this,
“ Govt. House ” had the front to ask the manage-
ment recently if it could arrange for the audience,
at the conclusion of the show, to remain seated
while the Governor and suite passed out. There
is, however, a limit to all things human—and the
management said No.

“ The Australian ‘ Naicest ’ will, no doubt,
ere this have copied the latest London society
expression ‘Rather fun,’” writes a Bulletin
scribe from the Big Smoke. “It is in general
use here, and seems to have ousted ‘ Quaite so ! ’
from the field. Instead of saying ‘Quite so’ you
simply say, ‘ That was rather fun,’ or ‘ That will
be rather fun,’ pronounced ‘ Rahthah fen,’ of
course. It embraces almost as wide a region of
meaning as a French shrug, and implies all sorts of
praise of various divergent events. For instance,
a concert, a ball, a cricket-match, a divorce-case, a
bicycle-accident, a picnic, a continental tour, a
supper after the theatre, a new play, nay, a pro-
posal to do anything, or a description of anything
done might all be ‘ Rahthah fen ! ’ ”

“ Excessive zeal ” is what a Sydney magis-
trate calls the systematic police-perjury which
charges nearly all the drunks brought before him
with having been also “ disorderly.” The chief
desire of the experienced toper is to get home as
unostentatiously as possible, and, the more
“ tanked ” he is, the less capable he is of statutory
“ disorder ” ; but, as he is also the less capable of
remembering afterwards what actually took place,
the “ disorder ” charge has hitherto been a soft
thing for the false-swearing copman. It may be
true, as a Sydney police-officer retorted the other
day, that there are “not so many policemen in
gaol as lawyers ” —but what about the ought-to-be ?

In a certain N.S.W. township the office of
coroner became vacant through removal to another
district of the P.M. (who had theretofore per-
formed the duty). The P.M., thinking that the
billet would not be unacceptable to a smart young
townsman whom fortune had not been treating
too kindly, offered to recommend him to the
authorities, and did so. When the matter came
before the bench of magistrates, only this one
nomination had been received, but one J.P., a
business rival of the nominee, raised objections to
the appointment of such a YOUNG man, and one
who was not a magistrate. The other beaks said

gallons of beer, a case of whisky, ditto of brandy,
and so forth, to the tune of d;2l in all. A., who
was with the vice-regal party, chuckled to him-
self at the lovely investment he had made with
that trout, but when he got home he nearly

Ballarat puts forward a loud claim as the
site for the Federal capital. Ballarat is a hand-
some, healthy town, and the abundance of lamp-
posts in the main streets increases its suitableness
as a legislative centre. People who have seen
politicians returning late from banquets will
readily understand. Those numerous Ballarat
statues are not without their advantages, too, as
was illustrated by the case of a Melb. man of some
note on the occasion of a vice-regal visit to the
garden city. The metropolitan personage was
seen wandering from statue to statue in the early
moon-lit hours, and, when interviewed by a sym-
pathetic policeman, was affectionately embracing
the feet of the poet Burns. “ Never met sush a
sochiable lot of (hie !) fellrsh in me life (hie !);
never ! ” he said as the law gently led him away.

Dear Bulletin. —“ What we
eat! ” Down Belmore Markets, last
Saturday morning, I noticed a Chi-
naman sitting on a heap of cabbagee
—nothing between his clothing and
the vegetables. When the Chow is
driving to market, he invariably sits
on the cabbagee, with—perhaps—a
sugar-bag between his dirty nether-
garments and the provender. Also,
on a North Sydney boat, one day, I
saw a Chow breathing on apples
and then polishing them with a
dirty rag. The shine produced on
the apples hawked by Dagoes in
the parks is also due to saliva and
elbow-grease. The common white
inan is too beastly lazy to spit on
his apples and polish ’em with his
handkerchief.—D.
Re “ What we eat,” a story is
going round the English press.
Two workmen meet. “What are
you goin’ to have for dinner a
Sunday, Bill?” “ Dunno ; missus
alius looks after that.” “What do
you say to a nice bit o’ pork ? ” “O,
I dessay we might.” “Well, now,
we’re goin’ to kill our pig, an’ I’ll
sell you a loin cheap.” “ All right,”
said Bill, “send it over.” Satur-
day night came, but no pork, so Bill
sent his son over for it. When he re-
turned, without the meat, “Where’s
the loin of pork ? ” said his father.
“ Can’t have it,” returned the boy;
“ they ain’t goin’ to kill the pig,
’cos he’s gettin’ better.”

Presbyterian General Assembly abuses the

Mayor M‘Eacharn, of Melb., astonishes

penny. “Aw! what’s this?” “Rebate,

quantities.” “Aw, I see—you’re a wag.

A popular Sydney medico, noted
for his good nature, was a little too kind-
hearted a few nights ago. Returning
homeward, near midnight, he encountered
a month-married friend, who had been
imbibing. Knowing where he lived, the
doctor guided him home, and rang the
bell. The door at once flew open, and a
white-robed figure clutched the benedict,
shook him, and dragged him inside. The
doctor waited to see no more, but turned
away. Half-way down the street, a clatter
drew his attention once more, and he
beheld his friend, shot forth catapult-
fashion, and land in a heap on the pave-
ment. When he bent over the sobered
wreck, it looked up at him and gasped,
“Wrong house—don’t live here —moved

Melb. : “A young lady, just mar-

and bacon-curing. She was mainly in-
strumental in building the finest local
church, known as ‘the cathedral.’ A
preacher was got one Sunday morning
quite ignorant about the pork business of
the locality. He dilated on the miracle of
the devils being driven into the herd of
swine, and justified it because of the
diseases engendered by pork-eating.”

Normanton (N.Q.) Circuit Court
was adjourned recently to enable a Croy-
don solicitor to attend and defend certain
aboriginals accused of murder. Solicitor,
however, didn’t arrive—the Crown fee was
too small to attract one. Mr. Justice
Power didn’t think much of solicitors who
would not defend men tried for their lives.
Considered “the profession was getting
low when it was reduced to a monetary
one.” This was really fine! But why
shouldn’t the Crown pay a decent fee in
tsuch’ cases?

An enterprising thief actually stole a law-
yer’s boots from under the solicitors’-table in Melb.
City Court the other day. The lawyer had taken
his hoof-covers off to ventilate his corns, and when
he wanted them they were gone. The Buli.etin
has no sympathy with the sufferer ; the ordinary
layman who dared to take off his boots in Mr.
Panton’s court would get two years for contempt.
The “ explanation ” of his conduct, which
Bairnsdale schoolmaster Langier gave to Yic.
Public Service Board was very funny reading at
Melb. City court last week and even the highly
expurgated edition published in the dailies had its
humorous aspect. In it Mrs. Langier asserted
that the girl be is now charging with perjury was
just the sort of character he wished to incorporate
in a book he contemplated writing, and, on his
realising this, he set about to “study” the young
lady, which he did by moonlight in a paddock,
where, so he said, she frequently made
attacks on the virtue of the said Langier. But
Langier pursued his investigations purely in
a scientific spirit, and the fifth act
was never played ; although Langier naively
remarks that “everything else” took place
between them. The strangest revelation of
all was that Mrs. Langier, the wife of the
schoolmaster, was kept fully posted by her hus-
band as to the progress of her husband’s “ psycho-
logical studies,” and apparently made no demur
through alleged faith in Langier. She did, in-
deed, on one occasion pen a note to the torrid
girl threatening divorce against her husband, and
mentioning that “ the moon had disclosed the pre-
vious night’s studies ”to her enquiring eye. She
added that her husband had made a confession,
full and particular, if not true, for she re-
peated details of a most complete character and
told the young lady that she was welcome to
her husband’s heart and hand “both of which had
been much polluted during the past six or seven
months.” Mrs. Langier added that “ I will never
lower myself to be associated with one who be-
lieves that variety is the spice of life.” The last
day the case was heard this letter was just being
questioned upon when Langier stepped behind the
witness and ordered her to be careful. P. M.
Panton promptly sent him to gaol for 24 hours for
contempt, and a long argument followed as to
whether the case should go on and the sentence
date from the rising of the court. Just in the
middle an indiscreet individual arrived and men-
tioned that Ranjitsinhji was batting, and the
court was adjourned in 1 l-ssec. The girl was
able to prove by the evidence of the two medical
witnesses that her virtue survived all the con-
tention.
• • * «
This case recalls an old comedy, named
“ The Dramatist.” Yapid, the hero, gets into all
sorts of feminine intrigues, to obtain pabulum for
waiting. _ The young lady thought Mr. Langier
was making love, while he was really only conduct-
ing experiments. When he got to, say, the 17th
chapter of his novel, “Innocent Adultery,” or
whatever it was, he found his physiology ran
short. Lord Nozoo had got the bewitching Mrs.
Jelly bag into the Park, among the ornate
aristocratic benches, but somehow the writer
had not the hang. So. in a perfectly innocent,
and merely Marcus-Superbus - and - Mercia way,
just stage fashion, he had to lead his lady-model,
his fellow-school-teacher, beneath the red gums,
stringy-barks, or whatever happened to be there-
abouts, and talk some stage-love, with a trifle of
stage-pawing, after which he would rush off to his
desk and scribble away with all the fury of a
Zolaa. But the poor actress in the concern took
it for genuine. The novelist said to himself :“ I
must go out with the model to-day and get the
correct physiological relation of Lord Nozoo’s arm
to Mrs. Jellybag’s waist. Then the phenomena of
the kiss. Let me see. Does the wicked earl im-
plant it on the mouth, the cheek, or the neck ?
Does the lady-novelist similarly experiment on the
male bird ? ”

Henniker Heaton’s proposal to travel the
feawlinies with a team of British M.P. cricketers
has a decidedly himperial appearance on close
inspection. The team will, in the first place,
assert the greatness of the “dear old mother
country ” by wallopping their Canadian and Aus-
tralian opponents in one innings, more likely than
not. Also, they will probably promote further
“loyalty” by the splendor of their clothes and
mannahs, and every time the captain of the dis-
tinguished visitors returns thanks or proposes the
health of the beaten team, he will lay himself out
to tighten those silken bonds. Moreover, the
triumphs of the All-Hingland Parliamentary
Eleven will furnish another Tory argument against
payment of members, and we will be treated to
invidious comparisons between the successful ex-
Etonian bowler who sits in the House of Commons

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, November 16, 1897.
Mr Dear Mtee—
Mrs. David, wife of the coral-boring Professor,
interestingly lectured the Victoria Salon on
Thursday afternoon on her adventures in the
Pacific Isles, dwelling particularly on dress, love,
and cookery among the Ellice Islanders. She
brought with her many examples of native gar-
ments —the whole wardrobe was easily carried in
a small hand-basket—and exhibited her little
daughter as a living picture “ faa Funafuti.”
(For fear any reader should feel shocked at such
goings-on at a ladies’ club, I hasten to add that
Miss David is only seven.) The “reform dress,”
a hideous print “ lava lava ” or kilt, and large
square bib back and front, is a lamentable descent
in beauty from the pre-missionary flower-and-leaf
garlands. Mrs. D’s audience laughed over a
specimen of a fashionable island hat—the first
missionary told his female flock to cover their
heads in church, so they all copied Mrs. Mis-
sionary’s best tile, and the unlovely style with
variations still prevails. When a girl falls in love
in the Ellice Group, she doesn’t let concealment
prey on her dusky cheek, but tells her love by
shaking a lighted torch over her victim’s back and
literally scorching him with passion’s fires ; or else
she coyly shies cocoanuts at his head. Two
students accompanying the scientific party were
the objects of such pointed attentions from native
belles that all the scientists passed one lively
week dodging flying cocoanuts. Funafuti girls
can aim straight. Infanticide is almost as common
as it is in civilised Sydney, but is practised by
system, every second child being destroyed. The
primitive Malthusianism arose from a fear that
the food-supply wouldn’t support a rapidly grow-
ing population.
They say the earl—the bogus Hardwicke—
became engaged to a certain squatter’s daughter
on the strength of his blue blood. When the
downfall came some kind friend rang up the
lady’s family to ask if congratulations were to be
offered on the felicitous event. And a loud “No ”
thundered through the ’phone like the report of
the one o’clock gun at Dawes Battery.
Many wheel women pedalled themselves on to
the crieket-match. Spinning along the road they
didn’t, as a rule, look lovely. Bikeresses don’t
beauty much in costume. They flash past shop-
windows too quickly to be able to see their reflec-
tions. The shop-window is the pedestrian woman’s
best friend, and helps materially to keep her tidy.
Another reason for the cycling dress being still a
mere compromise with ugliness is that you can’t
sit still on your machine in front of a looking-
glass and get a back view in a hand-mirror. If
that oould be accomplished almost every wheel-
woman would jump off her jigger with a yell of
despair. For it is the back view that is so
appalling. Up-to-date woman is decidedly not
made for the machine, and there is money await-
ing the inventive person who will make a machine
to fit the woman. Two wheels, a pair of tongs, a
stony-hearted saddle, and an onion-net—combined
—can’t ever be fixed up into an ideal car of Venus.
Members of the unlucky “ Bunch of Keys ”
touring co. were in town for a few days before
leaving for Newcastle. The ladies were all worked-
up to hysterical pitch, and the men depressed.
The trip was a long drawn-out chapter of acci-
dents. A tragic incident happened the day before
the fire at Bourke ; the co., which had put up at a
hotel on the river bank, saw a boat containing five
persons capsize before their eyes; four were
rescued with difficulty, but the fifth, a girl of 19,
was caught by a snag which had to be dynamited
before the body was recovered. Next night the
theatre was burnt down, the men’s dressing-rooms
suffering most. G. Lauri and W. Gourlay lost
much property, and the latter had the coat partly
burnt off his back ; the remains of the garment he
keeps as a souvenir. Next afternoon, having
moved on to their next town with a faked variety
show to fill in advertised dates with, they had
another fire-alarm—the hotel outhouses were des-
troyed. At Orange, through the upsetting of a
kerosene-lamp behind the scenes just before the
curtain rose, they had scare No. 3. At Dubbo
they arrived too late to play. From Orange to
Bathurst they travelled by a goods-train, which
crawled and shunted and kept the travellers grill-
ing in the fierce heat all day. Last horror of all,
Mrs. Lauri and Miss Gourlay had as companion
in the sleeper from Albury an invalid being taken
by her husband and nurse to a Sydney hospital,
and the poor creature’s moans kept them sympa-
thetically awake all through the last wretched
night of their ill-fated tour. Business was good
through it all.
Two well-known Australian surnames figure in
recent mail-news. Capt. R. C. Stephen, son of
Mr. Sept. Stephen, M.L.C., of Sydney, was
married in London on Sept. 29th to Miss Edith
Mary Osborne, of Elsternwick, Melb. Our Naicest
people, through intermarriage, will soon become
one vast family party.
This cricket-adoring population turned out in
thousands for the first day of “ the match,” and
on Saturday there was standing-room only (and
not much of that) in all the reserves and stands.
The back of the new ladies’ stand was fringed five
deep and even the little side balconies, from which
nothing can be seen, and all the stairs were masses
of muslins and millinery. Two records were put
up during the game: the first day’s temperature
topped the Nov. heat average, the second day had
the largest “gate” recorded at S.C.C. There
was no promenading on Saturday. Early comers
who had secured seats wisely sat in them all the
time, and went without afternoon-tea rather than
lose their places ; or else they employed obliging
men of their party as tea-room scouts, who darted
about in the crowd doing balancing-acts with full
tea-cups and piles of cake. It was worth the
money to see the crowd, and thousands of women
went out solely for that purpose, or else to behold
“Ranji.” Feminine interest in the players was
certainly absorbed by that well-boomed alien.
His every catch was applauded from the ladies’
reserves, and when he went to keep the wicket,
kid gloves were split in enthusiasm. Any merely
white player might crouch behind the sticks with-
out a hand-clap, but Ranji, “ the Prince,” was the
hero of the day with the title-worshipping woman-
kind. On .Saturday it was a cruel disappointment
to his admirers that his batting career was over
before lunch, and he was behind the scenes all the
afternoon. The men went out to see cricket, the
women to see each other and Ranji. By-the-
way, “ the Prince ” is the only player who doesn’t
turn up his sleeves. I wonder why 1
. The big-hat nuisance was as annoying in the
tightly-packed stand as it is in theatres. I was
amused at one woman, who was loudly denouncing
an “ Ich dien ” bunch of plumes on a cart-wheel
of white straw, which blocked up the view in
front of her, while the grumbler herself had on
her own head a funnel of pink ribbon, with chiffon
puffing out of it like smoke, which effectually
eclipsed the whole game from the man just behind
her. On the front lawn seat a scarlet parasol
glared and blotted out the universe to a large and
irritating throng of baek-seaters, who murmured
angrily about the lady “ with the umbreileru p, ”
until someone.remonstrated, and the bull-enrager
came down with an irate snap. The Governor’s
pen was filled every day, but sacredly curtained
off.above the railing ; all one could see were the
twin points of Capt. Fielden’s moustache, a healthy
fruit-orchard on the hat of Mrs. Sketfington-Smyth
(how Thackeray would have loved that name!), and
a pair of soiled lavender gloves waved by Hon.
Dorothy Brand in the background. Aides Free-
man-Thomas and Shaftesbury came overland for
the match, at which they wore straw hats sporting
the Australian colors. Aides, luckier than abo-
rigines, are railway dead-heads all the time, and
travel on the nod even when they go a-pleasuring.
On Monday, one of the sights of the stand was
Jakoff Hambourg industriously acting waiter, and
carrying tea to a whole ladies’ school, while the
fickle damsels looked over the top of their deposed
idol’s head to gaze at Ranji.
The Cri. was crowded on Monday night, when
the pupils of Miss Dunn, of Petersham, took the
stage, and gave an exhibition of fancy dancing in
aid of the Lewisham hospital. The juveniles did
all their steps and whirlings with great accuracy,
and the audience applauded enthusiastically!
I er *J. a P s the quaintest item of the evening was
the Lancers by a troupe of performing babies, who
toddled through all the manoeuvres without a
single breakdown—more than can be said of most
sets of Lancers at an adult ball. Miss Dunn’s
rose ballet was a prettily-posed arrangement of
small children in the background, while energetic
infants of a larger growth skipped in the lime-
light. The. children stepped out in all the dancing
in such a lively way, and entered into the spirit
of the thing so thoroughly, that it wouldn’t be
surprising if an 'epidemic of cellar-flaps, cart-
wheels and hand-springs were to attack the youth
of this city. Mr. Hawthorne, M.L.A., sponsored
the show and spoke a piece, remarking that the
juvenile dancers will probably whirl again for
charity in the suburbs.
Mrs. H. Booth (wife of the Harmy Com-
mandant) is banging the big drum in Sydney on
behalf of the saffron-haired brigade. Her method
is the “sisterly-sensational.” All patronising and
stand-off-for-I-am-holier-than-thou ” schemes of
reaching “ the fallen ” are strictly tabooed. It is
worth remarking that this up-to-date hail-fellow-
well-met-slap-on-the-back style of Salvation was
invented and used with immense success by
Mrs. H. Booth’s really grand and brainy mother-
in-law— the Mrs. Booth (the “General” is only
her widower). The best description of Mrs.
Booth s style of dealing with London street-
walkers is written by an authoress whose
book is a sealed volume to the Respectable.
It shows that Mrs. B. had that intuitive
gift of sympathy which amounted to genius. Her
followers copy her ; the big drum and the glaring
ad. and the sympathetic tea-fight remain, but
genius is incommunicable.
A correspondent writes noting some mistakes
in my account of the Limerick family. The
family tree of that aristocratic house was, it
seems, never transplanted in Victoria, the second
Lari of L. being in N.S.W., where he served Gov.
Bourke in a clerical capacity, and in Norfolk
Island where his son, the lately-deceased Earl,
was born in ’44. This son was an earlier “ Aus-
tralian contribution to the House of Lords ” than
the newly-ennobled Egmont, as his turn came in
66, on his brother’s death ; as an English peer he
sat as Baron Toxford (a baron is two rungs lower
in the social ladder than an earl); a younger
brother of his, Mr. E. S. Pery, is now settled in
N.b.W. Another county of Limerick family,
that of “ Guillamore,” was in Australia at one
time very much down on its luck. The late Paget
S.tandish O’Grady (4th Viscount), before he got his
title, was driving bullocks in Victoria in 1860.
The air is full. of rumors concerning the
morals of a very high, titled, Sydney personage
who is reported to have got himself into trouble
over the charming wife of a wealthy Sydney resi-
dent,. and will, it is said, play a very prominent
part in some divorce proceedings. Fabulous sums
are mentioned as having been offered by him to
square things, but, so far, it is stated, the
impugned person is not to be “squared.” Now,
I have it on the best authority that the whole
story is a malicious lie—originated, no doubt, by
certain dear friends of the lady, who is now
travelling with her husband and is on the best of
terms with l\im.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“At last week’s tea-drinking at the Austral
Salon, the hostess (Mrs. Theo. Hagens) entered a
protest against the way in which Salonites who
entertain at the above fashionable coterie waste
their substance in riotous cream-cakes and soft-
drinks. Mrs. A. gives an ‘afternoon,’ and pro-
vides hot-house flowers and printed tinted pro-
grammes ; Mrs. 8., in her turn, must go one
better, and so turns on an expensive caterer and
hired performers; consequently the impecunious
Mrs. G. retires abashed, and shunts her turn alto-
gether, and the long-suffering committee have to
stand tea all round on the off-Monday. Ever
since the Salon started, the determination of one
woman to outshine another has been the rock
ahead in the club’s course. Why not make a rule
limiting outlay—as is done at political elections —
and thus make the result of the struggle depend on
Taste, and not on Cash ?
“The Gay Parisienne No. 2, Ada Reeve, has
some new and original frocks which don’t quite
come up to the glitter of those of Ada No. 1. The
first-act fascination consists of rose-pink chiffon
and rapturous brocade ; another is gaily striped
like a sugar-stick ; the third unbuttons behind sud-
denly and mysteriously, and Julie Bon-bon emerges
as a‘coon’ in white with scarlet sash, and sings
the great hit of the piece, ‘ Susie Toosie,’ a haunt-
ing, tuneful ditty in the minor, miles ahead of the
ordinary, inevitable ‘ coon ’-song. Why must
there always be a love-lorn black-boy in every
show, now-a-days ? Comparing the two Gay
Parisiennes—they are very much alike—A.
Willoughby was the more ‘gay,’ but A. Reeve is
the more ‘ Parisienne.’
It must be remembered that Ada 11. created
the part, whilst Ada Willoughby just copied and
improved upon the business of Ada 11. The “Gay
Parisienne ” was much observed at the Anglo-
Ranji Victorian Cricket Match in a blue gown
with terraces of biscuit-colored lace running down
it, a blue hat with a paddock of cornflowers in it,
and a blue silk parasol. The shrug of the shoulders
acquired for the purposes of the part has developed
into a mannerism. Ada shrugged all over the
grand stand reserve.
“Compare dear little Julie Bon-bon and her
Frenchy skirts (at the Princess) to the bloomered
Mayor’s daughters, shapely ankles and all, and
confess that old mother Eve chose wisely, when
confronted with the responsibility of fixing femi-
nine fashions for all eternity, she preferred petti-
coats to pants. Of course, there are skirts and
skirts, and, for that matter, pants and pants.
Place before your mind’s eye, for instance, a
clothes’-line, grotesque with bifurcated flannelette
monstrosities, and at the same time recall Julie
Bon-bon in a whirling upheaval of black and
cerise. Alas, sisters ! between such as these there
is a great gulf fixed. Somehow, Mons. Auguste
at the Princess makes one think of a Jap. more
than of a Parisian; but Japs, are called the
Frenchmen of the East, aren’t they ? So no doubt
the family likeness is O K.
“At time of writing, Melb. girls were still cricket
mad. Thanks to glorious weather, the M.C.C.
grounds really looked gayer, more frilly and
feminine, on match-days, than Flemington of
late. For that matter, lots of race-clothes cropped
up again, beautified by sunshine, which showed
up the colors, flushed the wearers’ cheeks, and
brought out the coy tints of their hair. Besides,
feminine, cricket-enthusiasts—as a class, pretty
young girls, daintily rather than magnificently
dressed—are fully as ornamental as your typical
she race-goer, the smart society matron, strident
of voice as costly of toilette. Needless to mention
the hero of the hour! The local ‘Nicest,’ bless
you, are not half democratic enough to copy
English crowds in pet-naming their idol ‘ Ranjy.’
You hear ‘the Prince’ on one side, and ‘the
Black Prince' on t’other, till you feel bored.
“ Why do women go to a cricket-match ? Fifty
per cent., go to see the sights, and as every second
woman is a ‘sight’ in the eyes of her critical
sister, all are gratified. The other 50 per cent, go
to be seen by the cricketers. The attendance of
women at the M.C.C. ground during the four
days of the big match was enormous, and the
cackle ! —it would have savaged a penguin, and
that is the most patient and philosophical creature
I know of. After a casual survey of a non-
descript flannel-clad figure at the other end of the
ground: ‘ ls that the Prince? Isn’t he nice?’
‘ Yes, dear, there is something different about
him. Blood dors make a difference, you know.’
And it was Harry Trott after all! Later on :
‘My ! isn’t that a little fellow at the sticks now ?
Does he countone, I wonder?’ Wouldn’t Graham
feel pleased ? Again, when Ranji. was batting :
‘ Fancy the dear Prince playing all those men by
himself ! ’ ‘Yes, awfully clever, isn’t he ? ’ Then
of the umpire : ‘ Oh, that poor man in the white
coat; he has been fielding all day.’ ‘ I wish the
Prince would do some of his tricks.’ There was a
continuous prattle of artless gabble more or less
akin to the above all day and every day, and on
the third day tired Man went with his ears bulging
wadding.
“ ‘Cricket spreads ’ were a feature of the meet-
ing. Promoters seat scores of acquaintances side
by side so as to be on hand later on to discuss
befrilled poultry and strawberries and cream. But
to pic-nickers in full war-paint, what is lunch
without a table? Not a bad line, sometimes, to
lounge on the grass in a washing frock eating
sandwiches and drinking Billy tea. It needs
nerve, however, to sit bolt upright on a tight-
packed bench wrestling with jointless ehicken-
bones, stiff sugar-tongs, blunt fruit-knives, Sec.,
swept fore and aft by the critical glances of
peckish outsiders, while spilt fruit-salad and ex-
plosive ginger-beer go hugger-muggering all over
your best things.
“ Among the many ‘Naicest’ left out of the
Brassey ball, the maddest probably is an all-im-
portant dowager who has lately enlivened her
home by the society of thickly-gilt young persons
anxious to be introduced into the Inner Circle.
Her first charge speedily bestowed herself and
nuggets on a scion of a tony local clan. A suc-
cessor was promptly placed in the bride-elect’s
vacated shoes by trustees able and willing to pay
for the chaperone’s good offices, and boundlessly
trustful of her social omnipotence. Then
descended that bolt from the blue on the heiress
and her surprised clan.
t “ Elocutioniste Nellie Veitch, lately back from
’Ome primed with new professional and dress
notions, tripped round the Salon on last re-
ception day, pretty as a picture, in white Eton
costume, blue vest, and headpiece of bright
turquoise straw. Miss Louie Morell, smart
in her Flemington get-up of pink and black
muslin with Toreador to match, gave samples
of her vocal quality, and the Summerhayes
sisters duetted agreeably as usual on violin
and piano. The young Bananalander, 1 Syd-
ney M. Sharwood,’ now Cambridge fresh-man
whose prize long-jump and hammer-throwing
were recently chronicled by cable, is ‘MacShar-
wood,’ old Brisbane Grammar-school boy and only
brother of pretty Mrs. Steve Fairbairn, of Melb.
Young Sharwood and his sister, the ethereal belle
aforesaid, who looks literally sylph-like by con-
trast with her tall, sinewy, swarthy husband (one
of the ‘ handsome Fairbairns ’ and himself a Can-
tab athlete in his day), are natives of the hottest
district of Central Queensland.
“The Southern dailies which predicted a mar-
vellous meteoric shower for Saturday last, are re-
sponsible for the shocking midnight row between
two St. Kilda families, whose respective sons’
and daughters’ extraordinary method of viewing
the heavens after 12 o’clock was misunderstood
by the parents.
“The Age is annoyed with Lord Richard Neville.
That long, lean streak of aristocratic good gracious
wouldn’t let Syme’s weekly Leader do what it
liked in the way of illustrating the fancy dress
ball, so it is writ of him : ‘Lord Richard Neville,
it seems, entertains extraordinary ideas as to
the duties pertaining to the position of the
Governor’s private secretary.’ But Dicky is
never tired of telling people that he was once
secretary to Lord Cranbrooke what time that
nonentity was Lord President of the Council,
so (he thinks) he knows all about it. Besides,
if Richard Plantagenet Neville, with a pedigree
as long as his legs, is to be talked to by a man
with an inky finger, what is the world coming
to ?
“ A local paper describes the Government House
costume-ball as ‘ a well-bred crush ’! It certainly
was a crush.
“Dr. Hilda Gamble, M. 8., 8.5., of
Melbourne University, will, on 17th Nov., be
wedded to Dr. James B. Buchanan, of Collins-
street, Melbourne. Miss Freda was the first
woman resident medical officer in Melb. Hospital,
likewise foundress of the Queen’s Hospital for
Women, where women are doctored by women,
and base bipeds in trousers are anathema.
“ The guns of the disbanded Rupertswood bat-
tery are now placed one on each side of ‘ Cliveden’
street-door. ‘ Our bruised arms hung up for monu-
ments.’ How the new wine of sassiety loves to
pour itself into the old bottles of aristocratic
customs—and it keeps tame spiders to spin cob-
webs round the bottles too, as a guarantee of good
faith.
“ Melb. City Council is going to by-law the
flower-selling youths off the streets. These have
been numerous, but little or no nuisance this
spring ; and the cause of the crusade is, of course,
the reasonableness of their tariff compared with
that of the swell ‘By Appointment ’ shops. It’s
all the difference between Id. and 6d. for a button-
hole, 3d. and Is. or Is. 6d. for a bunch, with
quantity and quality in favor of the kerb.
“ A successful actor, at present in our midst,
ascribes his nether loveliness to a youthful diet of
brose and haggis. Yes, like nearly everyone who
noses his way to the front, Adonis turns out to
be one of Rab Tamson’s bairns. Years ago he
tried his prentice hand on Australian audiences,
but he was less brawboned then and, small as was
his r6le, he failei to find favor with local lessees
and managers. Now his ex-employers, the planets
of other times, have paled, and the star of the
glum Scotch lad of yesteryear ‘ twinkles like a
diamond in the sky. ’
“ Gov. Brassey edits the paste-cutting-book
dept, at Government House. References to him-
self are marked by a menial. The Old Man
of the Sea goes through them, and puts in a
heap those he desires to have preserved. A
glance at this book gives the impression that
people love and adore His Ex., for the shy
references to vice-regal ‘ closeness ’ and prosiness
which find their way into certain papers have no
place there : such things form an apocrypha ; the
true gospels are the gushy and obsequious bits.
Gov. Hopetoun used to put all sorts into his book.
He rather liked stories—and particularly pictures
—against himself, being a good-humored chappie.
“ The present inmates of Govt. House (includ-
ing Capt. Wallington, gazing aloofly from the
background) have souvenired the current gala by
a huge group photo, as libellous, in print at all
events, as pictorial productions of the wholesale
type usually are. Lady Brassey in the near dis-
tance bends over her child, as broad as it’s long,
in a white smock. His Ex., cross-eyed for the
time being, also guards the innocent, while
amiable, peaee-at-any-price Gov. Hampden, dan-
dles Freeman-Thomas, junr., on his fatherly knee
hard by. Most of the other ladies involved are
represented as minus waist, and the men’s
moustaches and eyebrows (but not their ears) have
got lost somewhere in the process.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
Chief Justice Sam Griffith has just com-
pleted his codification of Q. Criminal Law. A big
job—and performed, they say, well. Griffith, in
his preface, professes himself surprised that this
great branch of law “ has not been reduced to
writing in such a form that any intelligent person
can understand it.” What a sentiment to emanate
from lips forensic!

in more or less voluntary diocesan gifts.
There was much anticipatory licking of
lips in Sydney Hebrew circles when it was
rumored that a certain undischarged bankrupt,
who had “ got into ” them for a round sum, was
Mi the list of beneficiaries in a very “big” will.
But all the gladness passed out of Judah when it
transpired that it was the bankrupt’s wife who
was the legatee.
The absence of com-
petitive feeling in local
newsgetting is a point in
connection with the Syd-
ney press which strikes
journalists acquainted with
the fierce press rivalries
elsewhere. For instance,
it is on record that a new
leporter not long from
Maoriland happened on a
piece of specially i m portant
information whilst doing
“Government rounds, ” and
published it. Next morn-
ing his editor, noticing that
the item was not in the
rival paper, sent for the er-
porter and said in a tone
that contained more of sor-

While military medico
Williams, of N.S.W. Per-
manent Force, was so-
journing with Learmonth,
of Groongal, he deter-
mined to take the tusks
of a huge wild boar that
was known to be on Old
Br ingagee, and sallied
forth one morning to the
fray, with his host, both
armed with freshly-shar.
pened harpoons mounted
mi poles. While engaged
in sticking less important
pigs, they got separated,
and Dr. Williams sud-
denly found himself con-
fronted by the big beast
he was in search of, which
went for him vigorously
on the spot. The fright-
ened horse jumped about
•ill the burly surgeon
dropped his lance, and
things were beginning to
look very serious when Mr.
Learmonth dashed up and
fclled the brute with a thrust behind the shoulder.

What a catastrophe for Sydney’s most
gildrd sanctuary, St. Marks, Darling Point, if,
say, Peter Buggins or John Snooks had been the

label!—and said to belong to a really good man.
There lives at Pitt Town on the Hawkes-
bury (N.S.W.) a lady, Mrs. Horton, now 97 years
old, who, as a child, came to N.S. Wales with
Gov. Macquarie in H.M.S. “Hindostan.”
HARRY PICKER (alias “ the Earl of Haru-

Many years ago a leading Melb. morning
paper imported an editor—clever, but impetuous.
And he was not an abstainer from the Fiend. He
closed up a brief but brilliant career by writing an
article in which he dealt with the views of Dr.
Cairns, head of the Presbyterian kirk, in relation
to Cremorne Gardens, then run by George Coppin.
It was hot. And it wound up thus: “For our-
selves, we would sooner go to hell with George
Coppin than go to glory with Dr. Cairns.” He
went ’Ome shortly after.
The rich man Payne, who recently died at
Melbourne, was once travelling in a railway-
carriage in which Aspinall, Ireland and Dawson,
barristers, were also passengers. Payne carried in
his hand a bag of shrimps. He fell asleep.
Aspinall annexed the shrimps, and he and his
companions ate them—putting the heads and tails
back into the bag. At the end of the journey
Pay ne awoke, and took up the bag, looked into it,
and said, with a glance around : “Lawyersagain !
Nothing left but the shells ! ”
VISITOR: “ What are these , my man? ”
Gardener: “ Taters !”

King O’Malley has been giving S.A. jour-
nalists a spell of late, but he woke up the other
day. Said the “Lightnin’ Streak” in S.A.
Assembly:—“ I ask the House not to act like
midnight, skulking, famished, Texas prairie dogs,
barking at the imaginary ghosts of their departed
ancestors.” Which recalls Paddy Coglin, a long-
since deceased S.A. orator, and very fond of jaw-
breakers. One hot night while S.A. Assembly
-was debating a dry-hash Bill, Coglin suddenly
rose. “Mr. Speaker ! This noble measure needs
seriously meditative cogitation ! We must place
all the comprehensive arguments in juxtaposi
position ! ” Members sat amazed.
The long-sustained campaign in favor of
the claim of William Cresswell, so-called, to the
Tichborne baronetcy, is said to derive its going
power and justification from the fact that a will of
Cresswell’s, antedating his lunatic period, is in
existence and favors several influential private
persons. Aha!
Efforts are at work to induce Cardinal
Moran to accept an official position in N.S.W.
Local Option League. Some years ago he was
formally offered the vice-presidency of that body,
but now even the presidency is at his option.

bottle of holy water between them !
The “Vagabond’s” tombstone in Melb.
Cemetei’y was “ unveiled ” last week, and the re-
sult proved creditable to the industry of Mrs. Tom
Kennedy. This busy little woman first started
the idea that Julian Thomas would appreciate a
memorial over his grave, whereas it probably
makes the deceased journalist very tired.
G. Gibson Millar, the Australian million-
aire contractor, who revisits Australia per
“ Ophir ” has had two cabins knocked into one so
that his voyage may be more agreeable (writes
a Bulletin correspondent from London). He
says he has been suffering dreadfully from aortal
aneurism. His friends say it’s imagination, but,
anyhow, he looks very ill.
The late Johnny Sheehan, of Maoriland,
was credited with a sincere and Catholic (but not
Roman Catholic) admiration for the ladies of the
Maori race. At one of his meetings he was
heckled about his supposititious amours. “Turn
out the dug,” yelled Chairman Brodie, pointing to
the interrupter. “ He’s not a dog,” said Sheehan
with twinkling eye, “ he’s only a bit of a wag.”
Reading Gavan Duffy’s
articles in the Dublin Free
man’s Journal, the writer
is reminded that he was
once sent to Creswick to re-
port a speech by O’Shanassy
—then in Duffy’s Ministry.
It was a time of great politi-
cal agitation. The young
Democracy was feeling its
feet, and kicking—much to
the enragement and indig-
nation of the oligarchy of
the day. The speech in
question was of the highest
importance ; so that, when
the reporter got to Creswick
and found that the meeting
was over, he began to think
out the philosophy of suicide.
The other scribes had got
down their reports, and
grinned, of course. Reporters had
no mercy on each other in those
days. However, there was “ a show
for it.” Drinking down a soul-stiffener
of brandy, the scribe walked boldly
into big John’s bedroom. The great man
was asleep and snoring. The reporter awoke
him—by prodding the bed with a stick. He
sat up suddenly, and revealed a broad bosom of
long black hair that would not have shamed
a gorilla. Then the explanation and appeal.
“ Well, now, if that isn’t cool! ” said John ;
“but go ahead.” And then and there he re-
delivered his speech with such emphasis and energy
that he had an audience in the passage outside
drawn from every part of the hotel. “There ye
are, ye parseverin’ young divil,” said he ; “ be off
wid ye.” And that speech, when published, was
the boss speech—longer, better argued and con-
structed, and bristling with points that the other
fellows hadn’t got hold of. Big John explained
this by pointing out that he had “ slept on it.”
G.A.C. : Ernest Giles was the best pastoral
prospector that ever tramped round Australia,
but he never was a mining prospector or fossicker ;
hence the failure of his W. A. expedition.
One night “ Old Jack ” Robertson entered
Sam. Bennett’s office and slated the journalist in
characteristic style because of some remarks that
had appeared in the Empire that day. After
about five minutes of snort and scorching phrases
he turned on his heel and walked away. “ Well!”
exclaimed Bennett, taking off his spectacles and
turning to the writer, “ would anybody suppose
that man owes me a hundred pounds ! ” He lived
to get over his astonishment.
“ During the Autumn Newmarket meet-
ing,” writes The Bulletin’s London correspond-
ent, “ Mrs. Langtry was not permitted to enter
the club enclosure, thanks to steward Weatherby’s
influence, until Albert Edward interfered for an
explanation of her absence. The reply of the
stewards did not satisfy this staunch sticker-up
for his old friends, and he insisted on the old-time
Lily being invited to enter at once. The belle,
however, rang out a note of scorn and declined to
do so until requested in person by Lord Marsh,
when she, gracious in triumph, consented—and
the wigs of the female wire-workers shivered on
the green. ”
During last general election in Maoriland
a fierce battle was waged in one of the Southern
electorates. It was fought between an old Parlia-
mentary hand who had the support of Bung and
the Pagans generally, and a pious young man of
Highland ancestry, the bright, particular star of
the Cold Water and Bible - thumping cranks.
“Mac,” though blessed with many “saxpences,”
worthily upholds the economical traditions of his
forbears. His enemies say he would go to a pub.,
order a room, have a wash, take his lunch from
his bag and eat it, drink some water, and leave
the publican— his blessing. And that good young
man still wonders why he didn’t get in. The
aggregate beer-curse that was thrown after him
by the publicans of his electorate would have sunk
an apostle.
Geoffrey Eagar, at one time a figure in
N.S.W. Assembly, once referred to old Jack
Robertson’s taste for whisky. “We all have our
likes and dislikes in these matters,” retorted
Jack. “/ like a glass of grog—the hon. member
doesn’t. He finds his solace in sucking-pig and
cabbage.” Eagar, a teetotaller, had the reputation
(like so many of the “ temperance ” brigade) of
being a huge eater.
At the recent celebration of the golden
wedding of the Prussian chief executioner (heads-
man) there was a festive gathering of man-
butchers from all parts of Germany, and the
Emperor was on hand, as usual, not only with the
inevitable congratulations but with a “Jubilee
marriage medal.” Which surely ought to cause a
bad slump in the value of William the Mounte-
bank’s felicitations.
John Charles Crook Strange, who died at
Arncliffe (N.S.W.), the other day, was the
younger son of Frederick Strange, the Australian
explorer and naturalist of some 50 years ago.
Frederick Strange christened Mt. Stanley and
Mt. Acheron (M.L.) in 1849, the former after the
Bishop of Norwich, a friend of his. Soon after he
was killed by the blacks off the North Queensland
coast. His widow still lives and is a resident of
Sydney.
Kangaroo: “Met H. G. Wells, novelist
of the weird, the other day. A small, quiet man,
with spectacles; full of questions, incessant,
irritating questions on all sorts of Australian
subjects ; an insatiable, ‘ rapaciouS greed for in-
formation. Amongst his friends he is known for
his caricatures, and, had he failed as a novelist,
could easily have made a reputation as a ‘ black-
and-white ’ man. His drawing is admirable, and
his subjects as various as his ideas for novels.”
LEGAL INTRICACIES.
THE J.P.: “It is plain from the ividence that you
did not sthrike Constable Lowney; but you
would have done so if you was there. I
sintince you to fourteen days for being an
accomplice. ”
“ A Christian policeman does more real
good than any other member of the community,”
says Superintendent Read, of N.S.W. Police.
The Super, files his own bill for piety and police-
manship. He was the religious man of the 40
Londoners who emigrated from England to be a
nucleus for the N.S.W. force, and for close on 40
years he has supported his consistently pious repu-
tation.
Many jingles of PhilipD. Lorinier, who died
at Rook wood Asylum last week, are sung in shear-
ing-sheds and other way-back parts of Australia.
One reason for this is that he liked to pick some
melody in use and write his words into it. Lori-
mer really loved Nature. At one time he took up
his abode in a cave in the Blue Mountains so that
he might uninterruptedly commune with her, but
hunger and rheumatism drove him out.
Tom Garrett, old Jack Robertson’s hench-
man and once N.S.W. Minister for Lands, was an
effective speaker. But he sometimes fell into
inept illustration. “1 don’t value the slander a
hair of the Speaker’s wig ! ” he once exclaimed
with a fist-bang on the table. “ Ordah ! Ordah ! ”
cried Arnold, the Speaker. “I desiah to remind
the honorable membah that the Speakah does not
wear a wig, but his own haiah. At the same, time,
the honorable membah must know that he refers
to a symbol of authority and dignity in a very
offensive and derogatory mannah ! ” Arnold was
drowned in a flood of the Hunter. He was a fine
fellow.
Apropos the Lucknow strike and the pro-
posed searching of employes as they left the mine,
who searches Manager Lock when he leaves the
mine? The spectacle of G. Warnford Look in a
nude State, having his clothes “shook” by the
company’s auditor to see if any gold would drop
out of them, Would be highly edifying. The argu-
ment that Mr. Lock's position places him above
suspicion is beside the question ; so also is the fact
that he is a man of high personal character.
The Vegetarian newspaper (London)

The first man lynched in California was
an ex-convict constable from Tasmania. I re-
cently spent an evening with an old Queenslander
who knew him, and was present when he was
handed. His name was Jenkins, and before
leaving Tasmania he induced a ticket-of-leave
man to give him his money to invest. This man
was to be removed as a stowaway on board a brig
bound for ’Frisco. Jenkins got rid of the stow-
away by showing him to the water-police when
they came on board to make the final search ! A
large part of the trust-money was spent by
Jenkins on opossum-rugs, which my informant
saw in Jenkins’s shop in ’Frisco. Jenkins was
caught “red-handed” robbing a warehouse, and
the mob hoisted him two hours afterwards. There
was a Rhadamanthine spirit of justice in that
rough tribunal of diggers. They offered to value
his property, and give him the price of it and a pas-
sage anywhere he pleased, if he would reveal his
accomplices. Jenkins thought they were joking,
and said they “ could have his property for hang-
ing him ! ” The mob then offered him a chance
to make a will, and undertook to see it faithfully
administered. This offer was also declined, and
the order being given to “run him up,” he was
hoisted accordingly on or abou<b the 14th of March,
1850.

Some time ago a citizen of a Q. coast-town
entered the shop of a local bookseller, who showed
him some old books that had been stowed away
on one of the top shelves. One of these books was
devoted to “Prominent American Criminals,”
and contained a lot of photographs—among others
a faithful picture of the local doctor ! Here,
indeed, was a discovery. An investigation by the
Medical Board followed, with the discovery that
the “ doctor ” had got in on a dead man’s diploma.
When the Board confronted him with the photo-
graph he coolly observed, “ Oh, ye 3 ; a cousin of
mine who closely resembles me! Damn that
fellow, he’s always getting me into trouble ! ”
Later on he disappeared trackless into the blue
immensity, to be finally heard of in the South as
“ medical adviser” to a firm of quacks.

The prevalent advent in Queensland of
unexpected surprise-party babies is easily ex-
plained by ascientific factor of which the long-
eared multitude seems to live in Bceotian ignor-
ance. I refer to parthenogenesis. In partheno-
genesis we behold a brief return of the uni-sexual
period, or the union of both sexes in one, a pheno-
menon still witnessed in snails, worms, ascidians,
and many plants. Hence innocent virgins be-
coming innocent mothers to the astonishment of
the credulous ignorant, and the scandal of malig-
nant prudery. Any person who ignores this ex-
planation must be classed amongst those one-eyed
sceptics who are a blighting curse in all ages of
mankind. t t t 9

I n the days when Lieut. Bligh s native
police were hunting the blacks in the streets of
Maryborough, Q., and shooting them in the river
from the principal wharf, a half-dozen of the
fugitives took refuge in a loft over Norton and
Brown’s store. They crawled in there unseen by
anybody, and remained until near daylight. In
that loft at the time were ten barrels of blasting-
powder ! Next morning the storekeeper saw
where the blacks had been striking matches and
knocking the'Ved-hot ashes out of their pipes on
the ends of the powder-barrels. When this bo-
came known all the residents who lived close tc
the store retired to wipe off a cold perspiration !

When the Queensland Agricultural De-

knot atend to my wants and send moar rashans

Scene, a town west of Rockhampton. A
j a dy who had successfully run a shanty for about
two years was captured at last and brought into
town on a spring-cart, accompanied by all her
confiscated liquor. The case was tried before two
local squatters to whom the priestess of Bacchus
had been like “ Spain’s dark glancing daughters—
angelically kind.” The Bench sternly observed
that justice must be done though the heavens fell;
also, that sly-grog selling was assuming gigantic
proportions and must be stamped out with a strong
loot. To emphasise the Rhadamanthine severity
of their intention the Bench fined the lady two
dozen of beer, and acquitted her without any extra
stain on her character. At nine o’clock that night
one 0 f the two magistrates rapped gently at the
alab walls of the lady’s boudoir according to
special invitation. The lady whispered through
a crevice asking him to “call a little later when
the other visitor was gone ! ” The “other visitor ”
wa s the other half of the Bench ! The second
gentlemen retired to meditate on the deplorable
uncertainty of all human calculations where a
woman is concerned, and firmly resolved also to
make the fine not two dozen of beer but three
months’ hard on the next occasion. As I have
this narrative from the favored visitor himself its
authenticity is guaranteed.

Three weeks ago, a Hibernian policeman,

A Smile across
the Shoulder
FOR THE BULLETIN
I strike my flag to Maud
When the mashing spirit moves her
A fickle little fraud
Her treatment of me proves her.
The one day blowing hot
The next day blowing colder,
But she lands me on the spot
With that smile across the shoulder —
Deadly Maud,
With her smile across the shoulder.
Her form lacks supple grace,
Nor is stately as Diana’s ;
She’s freckled on the face
And vulgar in her manners;
No syren of the town
Hath an eye that’s any bolder,
Yet she brings her pigeon down
With a smile across the shoulder—•
Tricky Maud,
With a smile across the shoulder.
The earnest, honest gaze
Of young and artless Beauty
Whioh walks in Virtue’s ways
Obedient to duty,
Stirs not my passion-fire
Whose embers merely smoulder,
Till I’m quickened to desire
By that smile across the shoulder —
Sad to say,
Just a smile across the shoulder.
Though freely I assert,
In stern, emphatic diction,
Disliking for a flirt
The statement is a fiction.
I look at Maud, and long
In tight embrace to hold her,
When she comes it very strong
With her smile across her shoulder—
I’m undone
By that smile across the shoulder.
I used to like them coy
In days, ah, long departed,
When I was but a boy,
And somewhat simple-hearted ;
But now I’m tough and stout—
Turned fifty, maybe older —
The girl who’d lay me out
Needs to fire aoross her shoulder.
That’s a fact —
She must smile across her shoulder.

Chairman Krichauff, of S.A. Agricultural
Bureau, finds that the best trap for codlin moths
is a pickle-bottle containing a quarter of a pint of
syrup and a tablespoonful of boiled apples or apple
jelly, suspended on the slant on trees. The moths,
attracted by the smell of the apple pulp, get stuck
in the syrup, and there depart this life.
Grainger, M.L.A. (South Australia): —
“Not one of the W.C.T.U. deputation which
lately waited on the Premier to demand the
abolition of gambling would have refused a ticket
in Tattersall’s sweep if it were offered to her free.”
Which is probably true, if the ticket was offered
to her when the other W.C.T.U. female wasn’t
looking.
A recent investigation shows that of 335
girls, with degrees from Girton College, 123 are
teachers, 2 are missionaries, 4 are medical
students, 6 are dead, and the rest are living at
home, dependent on either parents or husbands.
Again, from the matrimonial point of view, out of
79 Girton girls who graduated with honors in
mathematics, only 6 are married; of 97 with
classical honors, only 10 are married ; of 47 with
honors in natural science, only 7 are married.
The numbers at Newnham have very similar pro-
portions. Evidently, the base British male taketh
not the blue-stocking to his bosom with much
fervor.
Mr. Frank Senior, who has been chemist
to the N.S. Wales Governors for many years past,
has conferred a blessing upon the citizens of his
country by discovering a wonderful cure for head-
ache. The new remedy cures instantaneously, is
very palatable, and perfectly harmless to both
ladies and gentlemen. Moreover, it is perfectly
effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-
ache may be. This cure, the result of years of
experience, can be had in 3 sizes, by post 1/4, 2/6,
3/8. Senior, chemist, George-street, Sydney.*
The same old story. A young Melbourne
woman came home to her mother, the other day,
with a damaged countenance and a wound in the
back of her head, and a graphic account of how
she had been outraged by three young men in a
right-of-way. The police were appealed to, and
the “ victim ” conducted them to the scene of the
assault. Subsequently she furnished a full de-
scription of the Missing Three, and yet the police
were not astonished w'hen a Melb. Hospital
doctor, having examined the “victim,” declared
she was telling lies. The doctor’s report appears
to have scared the lady, for she presently admitted
that she had been telling lies. The excuse of vir-
ginal hysteria couldn’t be put forward in this ease,
seeing that the fair tarradiddler was a divorced
wife.
Be Moonblindness : Dr. Bull (Norsk
Magazin for Lagevidenskaben, No. 6, 1896 ;
Deutsoh Medizinal Zeitung, Aug. 19, 1897)
relates the case of a sailor, previously healthy,
who, together with two comrades, had to sleep all
night on the ship’s deck, off the coast of Hon-
duras, in bright moonlight. When they awoke
early in the morning not one of them could dis-
tinguish the ship’s yards, and they could hardly
make out her bridge. This state of things con-
tinued for two months without interruption, when
the man who was the subject of Dr. Bull’s
observation lost sight of the other two sailors. On
his return to Europe the man consulted a
physician in Kronstadt, who prescribed cod-liver
oil. He thought his vision improved a little after
that. It was not until seven years later that Bull
saw him. There was then slight conjunctivitis,
and the whole visible surface of each lens showed
numerous little points that were bluish-white by
reflected light. Besides, there were fine stripes
radiating from the centre of the lens. Bull is con-
vinced that the impairment of vision was occa-
sioned by the moonlight.—X.Z.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

A Miner ;
Let me draw your attention to the fact that prisoners
have to pay their own fares from Coolgardie to Fremantle;
distance a trifle short of 400 miles. Case in point: A
few weeks ago a young man who had been sentenced at
Coolgardie to three months’ imprisonment, was informed
by the police sergeant that the cost of his conveyance to
Fremantle would be deducted from the moneys belonging
to him, then in police possession, although, as far as I am
aware, there had been no order made to that effect by
the court. The necessary £1 17s. 6d. was accordingly
deducted from the money which the prisoner had directed
to be handed over to a friend. Perhaps it was right that
he should pay for his transit, but that he should have to
do so at the option of the police is another beautiful
sample of Westralian justice.
In Paris, any suspected food or drink-
article can be analysed at the expense of the
municipality, which will further, if necessary,
prosecute the offender, who, upon conviction, is
not only liable to imprisonment, but may be com-
Eelled thereafter to exhibit in his window and on
is shop-door for a longer or shorter period, a sign
“ Convicted of Adulteration.” The huckster sym-
pathies are too strong in British communities to
admit of so salutary and logical a style of dealing
with dishonest tradesmen. “A nation of shop-
keepers.”
If some of the Bismarckian anecdotes are
true, the “man of blood and iron” will be noted
in history for the things he said, rather than the
things ho did. One yarn has it that old Emperor
William, taking a long ride with his faithful
Chancellor, was somewhat irritated at his com-
plaining of fatigue. “How is it, Prince, that I,
an older man than you, am not nearly so soon
knocked up ?” asked the Kaiser. And Bismarck
answered, “ Ah, sire, the rider lasts longer than
the horse.” The sole authority for this story
would be Bismarck, anyway, and he probably
didn’t get off the epigram on the spur of the
moment. He only thought of it afterwards. Or
perhaps another fellow had the idea. A Chan-
cellor who has made history gets many plums of
speech put into his mouth by newspaper para-
graphists.
A Parmer’s Plain Letter.
North Laen, via Minyip, V.,
July 27, 1897.
“It gives me pleasure to testify to the efficacy
of Warner’s Safe Rheumatic Cure. Some years
ago I was afflicted with rheumatics in the legs,
which rendered me totally unable to do my work.
For six years I suffered in this way. during which
time I was under seven different doctors, but
without receiving any benefit. The flesh wasted
away from the legs; while the toes and ankles
were swollen to a most abnormal size. In my
extremity I was induced to try Warner’s Safe
Rheumatic Cure. I used in all twenty-one
bottles, but long before I had taken that quantity
I was greatly relieved, and that amount of medi-
cine did what all else I had tried had failed to do,
and lam cured as a result. I can now do my
work, and am a wonder to those who knew me
during my years of suffering.”

Japs and North Australian Pearls.
A w*LL-informed N. Queenslander Bends The
Bulletin some loose-talk about pearl-shelling :
According to Govt. Resident Douglas, the diving fatal-
ities up at Thursday Island occur principally among
Japanese boat-owners.” This means that the Japs, form
syndicates, who rent boats from white storekeepers, who
call themselves shellers, but stay ashore, and every man-
Jap. on board each boat dives, whether he is a practised
diver or not. As each boat takes out only one diver s
license, the Japs, thus have a big pull on the whites who
dive for themselves. A diver can t keep below water for
very long, but has to come up to rest; much also depend-
ing on the state of the tide and weather. The Japs,
simply work all round ; as soon as one diver is pulled up,
another jumps into the dress and goes down They have
a corslet with a double arrangement to fit differently-
sized helmets, and they thus continually cheat the reve-
nue by working with unlicensed drvers.
What makes detection of this evasion difficult is that
each Jap. is more like every other Jap. thi J n “ e 18 “f 6
himself. They are worse than the collectively undis-
tinguishable Chinaman in this respect. An aiteration is
proposed to be made in the law, under whioh each diver s
license will contain a personal description of the licensee
—“ color,” “ color of hair,” apparent age to date, height,
distinguishing marks, eto., but the versatile dap. will
“ get there just the same.” Every Jap. is of the same
color as every other ; every Jap. has black hair, etc.
* * * *
Jap. divers risk their lives carelessly, partly because of
their fatalistic temperament and partly because they are
paid by results. The vogue is to ship these boat-renters
as “ shilling-a-month ” seamen, and give them a percent-
age of the value of the yield. Japs, will go down into SO
fathoms (!), and say nothing about it. So will Manilla
men, but these only stay down a few minutes and are very
careful, few deaths occurring among them. If a Jap. is
taxed with having been deep diving, he will strenuously
deny it, unless caucfht on the spot, and will Bwe ®£ by
his ‘gods that he has not been down more than 18
fathoms or so.
* * * *
Should the inspector of fisheries raid a boat while at
work, the diver who is hauled up will swear until his
brown face becomes white that he is the very Yokohama
to whom the inspector issued the license, and “ the devil
a bit of know will the inspector know, you know. Be-
sides, they are not so easily caught. For instance, when
they are on the raid for pearl-stealing—everybody who
gets the chance steals pearls in Torres Straits they have
a look-out man perched at the masthead, and if any
strange sail comes in sight they up-anchor and away.
* * * *
Pearl-stealing, in some of its phases, is a fine art. The
ordinary method is for the diver to raise small shell, that
is, shell under the legal size-limit, which used to be 6m.
but is now Bin. across the nacre—that generally gives an
outside measurement of 6Jrf>in. These shells are ripped
open and fossicked for pearls and then thrown over-
board, as they would be condemned by the Customs in-
spector ashore. White divers tell how they find lots
of “dead shell” thus destroyed at the bottom
on the pearl-oyster beds. Fine pearls are got m
small shells, though how many is kept dark for obvious
reasons. Stephen Pack, a scientific expert, who has been
engaged by James Clark and Co. to try and “cultivate
the pearl oyster, tells how he has found a good-sized
pearl in a shell only an inch in diameter ! G. Smith, a
practical sLJller in the same firm, declares that he found
a pearl worth £lOO in a shell under the 5-inch limit, and
a £2OO pearl in one a little over six inches. These
instances illustrate the incentive there is on the part of
wages-men to look for illicit perquisites. Pace says that
the pearl grows with the growth of the shell ; on the other
hand, a practical diver declares that oysters vomit the
pearls that grow too big and annoy them. It is remark-
able how dense is the ignorance, even among scientists,
of the habits and life of the pearl-oyster, but Jambs Clark
and Co. have agreed to give Pace £lOOO a year for three
years to try and succeed in cultivation.
Every pearling boat, and every man on board, and his
traps, are searched for illicitly-obtained pearls directly
they come ashore. But the searching is a farce. There
is nothing easier to be done than to hide a pearl except,
perhaps, the ease of selling it, although pearl-buyers have
to be licensed. Everybody on Thursday Island buys
pearls; everybody sells them; therefore everybody is a
wilful law-breaker. An agitation is now afoot that pearl-
dealing licenses should be abolished, as the law is held in
utter contempt. A license is £lO, and runs for a year
only. The futility of searching on shore suspected pearl-
stealers was illustrated by a witness, Hudson, before the
Q. Pearl Fisheries Commission a month or two ago ; he
told the Commission of a man who was “ known to have
pearls with him n being searched at the landing-place,
and how all his traps were ransacked, without result. The
E earls were all the time concealed in the soap with which
e was washing his hands !
• * * *
One of the dodges of pearl-shelling wages-men to get at
pearls without destroying the shell in cases where there
are no pearls, is to leave the shell exposed to the sun for
an hour or two. Then the oyster gapes and they examine
him. If he has a pearl, he has to be ripped and cast
overboard; if not, a bucket of water is thrown over him
In company with his mates, and he closes up again all
right. There is also said to be a practice among the more
artistic pearl-seekers, of not only exposing the shell to
the sun, but, if the oyster is obstinate in respect of his
calipers faculty, of tickling him at the mouth with a
stick, which seldom fails to make him yawn ! This state-
ment is, probably, somewhat of an exaggeration.
• • * *
It is, however, a curious fact, as regards Torres Straits
pearl-shelling, that few or no pearls are found in shell
raised by wages-men—that is, by Japs, and other colored
crews who go out alone ; but that pearls are plentifully
found in shell raised by white divers who do their own
diving ! If the boat-owner goes out by accident with his
diver, it is an observed phenomenon that the shell raised
contains many and fine pearls. As a fact in submarine
natural history, this deserves to be noted by scientists !
* * * *
The Japs, are getting the pearl-shelling industry of
Torres Straits pretty well into their own hands. There
are now only three or four white divers on Thursday
Island. Colored men superseded them, and Japs. squeezed
out the rest of the colored men. Three large firms do
nothing else in the shelling line beyond renting boats to
Japs., and getting round the law by shipping the crews
on the nominal wage of a shilling a month. They thus
run no risk and make big profits, but are surely giving
away the industry to the “ little brown man.” An attempt
is to be made to knock on the head this Ailling-a-month
artifice, and to conserve the fisheries to Queensland’s own
people, by legislating that no aliens shall be permitted to
own licensed boats or rent them, and that whites who
hire out boats to aliens shall be liable to penalties ; also,
that the wages paid to crews shall be set down in the
shipping articles. Aboriginal natives are to be allowed to
fish, license free, in their own boats and in their own
waters, but are to be restricted from working without
licenses for white employers. The Queensland Govt, has
recently made a treaty with Japan, under which the Jap.
Govt, has promised to discourage emigration to Queens-
land, and is trying to turn it towards Brazil and Mexico.
* * * *
The slave-trade shoots out a tentacle from the pearl-
fishing entity. Polynesians are actually indented—boat-
owners deny that their system is “ indenting,” but it is
practically nothing else—from Sydney and “ the islands,”
under no obligation on the part of their employers to
return them to the port of shipment or anywhere else.
There is no restraint on this, as the “boys” are not
actually “ engaged ” until they arrive at Thursday Island
—a somewhat barefaced method of cheating the law.
Thursday Island is now a pestiferous distributing centre
for Japs, who drift in crowds along the Queensland coast,
and bob up serenely in all parts of Australia. There is at
present not one naturalised Jap. on the Island; there
have been two—one returned to Japan and the other
went to Port Darwin, the other open back-door of Aus-
tralia for colored aliens. Not a Jap., therefore, has a
vote; yet the pearl-shelling industry is now being run
chiefly for the Jap.’s benefit, except in the cases of the
few big firms who make the “ little brown man " their
wealth-finder.

Mac. : Please don’t call it “ the Alfred Hos-
pital, Sydney.” Call it the Alexander Hospital—that is to
say, the Sandy Hospital. Eh, mon ! . Wesley: That
wasn’t what decided the jury’s verdict. The pair
earnestly contended that they weren’t on over-friendly
terms ; but one witness swore that, as they left a certain
restaurant, she flicked the crumbs off his waistcoat. The
Court at once concluded that she was deeply interested
in him H.O.R. : Thin little hair-oiled incident
Memo : On the contrary, it is pointed out that the con-
tributions of rich Catholic laymen to the Melb. St. Pat-
rick’s are very much behindhand, and that the priest-
hood and the poor have mainly furnished the money
Pat : The reason why lawyers and clergymen mostly
shave is that they want to show that they can manage
their mouths. It takes a very expert liar to manage his
mouth in public, and the act of clean-shaving (or monkey-
shaving) is a sort of Declaration of Ability An Aus-
tralian : Mere abuse—also you have put nine lies into
seven lines. Will print your letter in full if you dare to
sign it with your own name E. Sims: Yes, as Smith
continued to occupy the land he is liable for the rent at
the rate fixed in the lease W.H.Y. : Divorce item good

drawn .... Harry Monck: Please send exact address
J.F. : Anyhow, we aren’t going to help a poisonous black-
mailer who lives on the game A.W. : We have reason
to believe that that modest self-advertising newspaper-
proprietor is a duke in disguise Mundic: But, then,
you rarely get any real humor, and never any wit at all,
out of the grinning man. He is only a joyous ass, full of
the delight of living. The humorist is a solemn-looking
man with a liver Another: Oh, yes; the Windeyer
subject is threadbare ; but the late Judge’s praises are
still being chanted in the most Respectable section of
the daily press True Charity : Sydney Charity Organi-
sation Society consists of a limited number of more or less
well-to-do people who provide its funds. And, as they
voluntarily provide its funds, we suppose they ought to
be free to do as they like with those funds, provided
they don’t make themselves a nuisance Eucalypt:
Sorry quite off our track .... Native Dog: And native
doggerel J. Reklaw : Considerable “go,” but educa-
tional handicap too heavy Alex. K. : Same old dying
swagman-—same old buried past—same old everything !
Epsilon : Hardly point enough J. : Joke micro-
scopic.... E.B. : None up. Karri : Moss-grown antiquity. ..
Wilkins: On the flimsy side O.J.H. : “Cycle”—tyre
blown-out 1 J.H.B. : Strongly suspect you perpetrated
the thing yourself; don’t matter much who the culprit is,
in any case F. Mostyn : “Perused” accordingly—but
neither used nor “abused.” Verb. Sap. : No, thanks.
It’s “Gen. De B.” you’ve got hold of, anyhow—not
“Madame Angot.” H.C.: He isn’t deservedly popular,
and he didn’t have the Speakership bestowed on him. As
for his owing a milk-bill—why, he probably owes dozens
of ’em. Your yarns are very soft and foolish ; also, your
statements are incorrect HughM‘C.: “ Maysie ” is too
direct Klepto : Yes, but you must be a little less
sweeping- and reckless Dinks : You are right. The
mistake was copied from a “ History of the Meib. Cup,”
in which Silvermine was twice described as a grey horse.
H. Monck : Note posted A. M‘K.: Acceptable
A. J. 8.: Glad to hear from you. Memo, posted. R. J.E.:

—first ball! Dingo: Dreadful tangle Bray: No
edge to it L.M.D.: “Unanswered” begins well, but
peters-out rapidly Maori: “Ruby” bit off-color.
Some of other items usable J. Ruble : “ Financed,”
without form and void Rubyard : Good I—but imita-
tions not in our line. SB : Starts off well, but never
gets anywhere Zadig : Witnesses’ oaths are sometimes
worthless, sometimes binding. The law is justified in
considering half-a-loaf better than no bread. No argu-
ment serves except that of experience, applied to expe-
diency ; j'ou can’t generalise from your own feelings
W. H. M‘C.: Many thanks Z.: This paper rolls as few
logs as possible.... Flute : Have mislaid vour address.
Kindly re-supply Pom Pom : Memo, posted C.C. :
Thb Bulletin doesn’t know Suffleld or any of his people

of this paper has ever even seen Suffield. Until his trial,
we never even heard of him ... G. Goodland : Author Dr.
Bernardi, Chicago. Try G. Robertson and Co. Sydney. ..
T.D. : Safe to predict that the medical Mac under dis-
cussion will fully realise the delicacy of his position
directly he comes face to face with his regiment of re-
bellious undergrade H.0.M.: “Waiting” is but be-
ginners’ work. Suppose you work off your crudity on the
local paper ! Darragh : Gnce more, good “ fact” isn’t
necessarily good fiction Karl Osb. : Merely young
Nulla : Plenty of crude force—and that’s all at present.
Try and train your young elephant J.A.H. (M.L.) :

haven’t Lex (Tenterfleld) : Tame C.H.S. : Declined.
.Fairplay: What is the Tasmania disaster fund to
which you allege s.s. providores will not permit men to
contribute because originated by a union? J.L.K. :
Rhymes must be based on common-sense. What has
“ the First Eternal Cause ” to do with the Genesis “ in-
crease and multiply ” text —penned by who knows what
Jewish fabulist ? J.G. (Q.): Received Jan. : Wants
novelty and force Anti-S. (M.L.): Grievance best
ventilated locally J.D. : Well, what if the prize Tas-
manian beauty is in a private bar ? Bar’s all the better,
and it doesn’t follow she’s any the worse Quhair : You
speak truly—“the N.S.W. Government are in favor of
Federation, only no intelligent person believes it.”
H.H. : Indictment looks too comprehensive. For in-
stance, the statement that every second girl in Queens-
land country towns is an unmarried mother doesn’t
square at all with the illegitimacy records M.M. : You
say your poem “has not appeared in any newspaper,”
and we trust that it may continue that way French
Maid : Sketch not up to mark True Believer : Joke hot
quite so new as it might be Eucalyptus : A tremend-
ously learned disquisition on the great unfathomable
Dunaget: The iocal editor’s wisdom in rejecting your

print the first sentence of your tale : “ In the front
parlor, bleak and bare, of a four-roomed cottage in a
quiet, soporific little village in the county of Kent, sat
Rose Starling, a strikingly handsome woman of the
peasant class, gifted with a splendidly symmetrical, if not
altogether graceful, figure and a pair of brilliant black
eyes which seemed capable of either good or evil in no
Bmalle degree ; she appeared to be waiting for some one
whom she is more than anxious to see as is soon attested
by the sound of a horse’s steps pulling up at the very door
and the appearance of a pale, blast-looking man with an
habitually languid air, who, however, appears slightly
perturbed at the present moment as he advances and ;
clasps the woman is his slight, sinewy arms.” We now go :
out for a well-earned drink .T.C.D. : Received ;
Cornstalk : Thanks Mendo : The oft-repeated cry that
Supreme Court Judges are badly-paid because successful
barristers made more than they do in certain years, is
largely traceable to the unconsidered fact that the barris-
ters’ guild, out of which Judges are taken, holds its doors
so tightly closed against what should be legitimate com-
petition for the doing of legal work. The large incomes
certain barristers make would not fall to them with an
open or fairly-open Bar. Many of the best-paying cases
would receive, truly and in popular estimation, as good
treatment in the hands not now allowed to compete. But
it is alongside the incomes of these best-paid barristers
that Judges’ salaries are placed by those who cry out on
the latter’s behalf.

SOME SYDNEY MATTERS.


Apropos Col. Home’s report on the unre-
liableness of the western (N.S.W.) rivers,
ties indubitably show that reliableness has
been increasing in late years. The stocking
of the country first by cattle and then by sheep
has solidified the porous surface; sheep-pads
leading generally down to water, have served
as the beginnings of small streams, and cart-tracks
(also generally leading down to water and espeoi-
ally towards the sometimes navigable rivers} have
been, in course of time, turned into larger streams,
all adding to the flow of water from the country.
The average height of the Australian Rifles
(N S W.) is sft. as against the Imperial In-
fantry average of sft. 6Jin. The tallest N.S.W.
warriors are the Irish Rifles, who average-like
the Royal Irish Constabulary—sft. BJm.

and removes it in the early stages.)
USE ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT.’
It Is Pleasant, Cooling, Soothing, Health-Giving, Refreshing and Invigorating.
YOU CANNOT OVERSTATE ITS GREAT VALUE IN KEEPING THE BLOOD PURE AND FREE FROM DISEASE.
“AS an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO’S ‘FRUIT
SALT,’ I have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO’S 'FRUIT SALT' he now ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it, about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.— I remain, yours faith-
fully, J. W. Neil." —( From the late Rev. W. Neil, Holy Trinity Church, North Shields.)
HEADACHE and Disordered Stomach.— “ After suffering for nearly
two and a half years from SEVERE HEADACHE and DISORDERED
STOMACH, and after trying almost everything, and spending much money, with-
out finding any benefit, I was recommended by a friend to try ENO’S ' FRUIT
SALT,’ and, before I had finished one bottle I found it doing me a GREAT DEAL
of GOOD, and now lam RESTORED to MY USUAL HEALTH; and others I
know that have tried it have NOT ENJOYED such GOOD HEALTH for years.
— Yours most truly, Robert Humphreys, Post Office, Barrasford."
The effect of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ on any DISORDERED and FEVERISH
condition is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE’S OWN REMEDY
and an UNSURPASSED ONE.
CAUTION. —Examine each Bottle, and see CAPSULE is marked ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT.’’
Without it, you have been imposed on by a WORTH LESS imitation. Prepared only by

POLITICAL
POINTS
Two politicians that the Vic. Bible-in-
schools crowd tried their hardest to wreck at the
recent election were Higgins and Gillies, and
their return was an awful smite on the nose for the
godly.
Ed. Bulletin, —The “ interesting prayer ”
you quote from Q. Wokkeb as being used by
Speaker Cowley to open every sitting of Q. Beg.
Assembly, is the prayer always used in the
Anglican Church all over the world, while Parlia-
ment is sitting. But Cowley should leave it
alone. —D.
A N.Q. town —democratic, of course.
Prominent residents (also democrats) lease their
f round to Chows for fruit and vegetable gardens.
! very body deals with the Chows, until an anti-
alien fury seizes the place, and the residents show
their disgust by dealing with John as before —but
refusing to pay him.
THE WAY TO GO.
STRANGER (to Cocky): “ Could you tell me the way to Thargorumbeburrah"?
COOKY : “ I can that 1 Yer go beyant there, thro’ the fince end down the lane
till yer come to where a house wus; but there's no sign there now.
Then through the scrub and over the ridge and you’ll hear a dawg
bark, and you’re there—if yer don’t yer lost, by jabers!”
Premier Kingston’s Gaining Suppression
Bill will probably be killed by its friends in S.A.
Assembly. Some holy members want to include
the suppression of the totalisator, and other drastic
provisions. 36 members —out of 54 —spoke on the
second reading !
Apparently the Tasmanian Ministry has
struggled through its troubles, and will go on
gridironing the West with syndicate railways a
little longer. Still, the defection of Attorney-
General Clark is a heavy loss, and if Clark—the
brightest man of a dull team —goes definitely into
Opposition with a vigorous policy the days of the
Braddon-Fysh Govt, will probably be few and
troubled.
The Glenelg railway, the only private line
in S.A., will probably be shortly acquired by the
Government. A. 3. \V. Government is beginning
to contemplate the purchase of the Moama-Demli-
quin line, and has just acquired the Rosehiil line.
The Great Southern, in Westralia, has also just
become State property, and, in one way and
another, private railway biz. is fast becoming
extinct in Australia.
An interesting law-point cropped up re a
forfeited deposit at the East Gippsland (Vic.)
election. Four garnishee claims to the ±5O were
put in by creditors of the unhappy candidate, and
one claimant argued that he was entitled to first
cut at the cake, inasmuch as he had a Supreme
Court judgment to go upon, whilst the other
creditors were merely third-rate applicants from
Petty Sessions. Whichever way they settled it,
there was not so much as a crumb of the fatty
left for the hungry Turner Govt.
Victoria was kind to Premier Turner.
Observe that, immediately upon returning to their
provinces with their new honors, Whiteway (New-
foundland) and Escombe (Natal) were defeated.
A high southern official to The Bulletin
from London : ,
I have had much consideration shown me here by
reason of my official position, but, speaking generally,
Australians are somewhat at a discount. It is a curious
thing, but I have not met more than two persons here
who profess liberal opinions, nor did I meet more than
three persons in Ireland who professed to be Home-rulers.
This does not mean that there are no Liberals or Home-
rulers, but it is not the lot of the ordinary visitor to find
them out. The Jingo feeling is excessively strong and
will lead to war one of these fine days.
Down in Albury (N.S.W.) district land
which the squatter bought or dummied not so
long ago from an easy-going Government at 20s.
or 255. an acre is now being let out by him to
agriculturists at as much as 10s. an acre per
annum. It was the huge Riverina pastoral estates
which Reid’s Land for Closer Settlement Bill was
allegedly intended to break up, and a decent
measure, without the fish-like odour of corruption
which hung about that bygone scheme, might
have done a lot of good down there.
N.S.W. country paper :
Currently reported in Sydney that Mr. Want will re-
sign the office of Attorney-General and that Lands
Minister Carruthers will take his place. If so, it will be
the first time in the history of N.S.W. that a solicitor has
been permanently appointed to the position of Attorney-
General, an office which, as it confers the leadership of
the Bar, is usually held by a member of the long-robed
branch of the legal profession.
Which is an error. James Martin (afterwards
Chief Justice) was a solicitor when first appointed
Attorney-General by Cowper in 1856.
Billy Maloney,
Yic. M.L.A., threa-
tens the introduction
of a Referendum Bill
at an early date, and
already is heard the
Tory cry against the
measure, instancing
the recent decision of
the people of Greece
to make war against
Turkey. Well, the
object of the referen-
dum is to give the
people of a country
what they want. The
Greeks wanted war,
and they got it.
Melbourne : Let
us rip out this word
Charity, and substi-
tute something like
Public Duty. Sweep
away all the humbug
of the religious side-
show, the pretence
under which the fats
of the Cloth get ob-
liquely subsidised.
The Rev. Mr. Treble-
chin gets his .£lO a
week because of the
gre-a-t work he does
among the poor, and
that same moan
about the poor is al-
ways the most effec-
tive mode of raising
the shekels. Now is
the time for Victoria
to show that Maori-
land cannot take the
lead in every great
movement of the irre-
sistible tide of State
Socialism.”
Although the erst-
while stalwart John
M‘Elhone is sadly
fain to admit that his
body isn’t strong
enough to let him again contest Fitzroy (Sydney)
electorate, warrior Chapman has the temerity to
think that his mind is equal to the task.
Premier Seddon made a wise departure
this session by simply dumping his printed
financial statement on the table of Maoriland
Parliament without reading it, and supplying
each member with a copy to digest at his leisure.
It saved two hours of dreary, hoarse stumbling
through a document which every member has to
read over for himself in any case before he can
remember what it is about.
The rumours of a big loan to be floated in
Maoriland this year have faded away. Still,
Seddon is dabbling in a small way with the un-
olean thing, and proposes to float a little quarter-
million—±2oo,ooo for railways and £50,000 for
education. The railway idea might possibly be
excused as a “ permanent and reproductive work,
but the idea of charging the education of this
generation to posterity is unvarnished swindle.
Australian papers are quoting, with the
remnants of their Jubilee enthusiasm, the latest
almighty say-so of cock-sure Kipling :
For the white man to explain that he is loyal is about
as unnecessary as for a respectable woman to volunteer
the fact that she is chaste.
Without a hard-and-fast definition of loyalty this
assertion is about as lucid as a sneeze. If Kip.
means by loyalty the first dictionary meaning,
“ devotion to a sovereign,” he is simply cheeky,
with the impudence of a boss prophet—he is a
self-constituted Moses slithering down the moun-
tain of his own conceit with the eleventh com-
mandment under his arm.
AT HER WORD.
“ Gam now, Bull Head, ma sea yer ’ave ter gimme
'arf yer bread."
BULL HEAD: “ Naw, won't. Yer jest said yer
wished yer was dead—and bread's ther staff
er life.”
Fitzgerald, M.L.C. (Vic.), who has been
’Ome, says Premier Turner has broken with the
Labor-party, because he finds after his Jubilee
visit that he has now two reputations to maintain
—one in England and one in Australia. But no
Australian politician has ever succeeded in main-
taining two reputations. It is much more than
enough for the average parliamentarian to main-
tain one. .
Queensland proposes to go into the r ede-
ration movement with the proviso that the
Kanaka Parliament shall have power to refuse to
submit the proposed Constitution to the people, if
it is one of which the Nelson-Tozer majority dis-
approves. The people who tried so hard to drag
the Piebald Land into the movement have done
Federation a bad turn. That province, with its
strictly Fat Man franchise, will almost certainly
send a crowd of Tories to the Melbourne Conven-
tion, to combine with the Westralian and Tas-
manian fossils in voting down every progressive
idea. Then having helped to spoil the prospects
of the other provinces, it will probably stand out
itself and cackle sardonically in the distance.
In 1894 Maoriland had 25,851 persons em
ployed in factories; in 1895, 29,879 ; in 1896
32,387; in 1897, 36,918. This is by far the largest
and steadiest increase in the Seven Provinces, and
Maoriland, in proportion to population, is now
the boss manufacturing state of Australasia. It
has attained this position almost at one jump
since it began to go in for “ advanced and
“grandmotherly” legislation—to regulate hours
of labor, enforce weekly half-holidays, look after
the sanitary condition of factories and workshops,
and generally harry the miserable employer off his
head and drive capital out of the country. _ Also,
it has got there under one of the most rigid pro-
tective systems in the Seven 7 /ovinces.
NO WASTE AND A GREAT WANT .
MAOK STIGGINS: “I gave you money yesterday,
my friend. Waste not, want not.”
TRAVELLER : “ But I swear I didn’t waste a drop,
mister, an’ no mam could want a drink more’n
I do this morning.”
Ed. Bulletin, —Speaker Cowley’s daily
prayer in Bananaland Parliament is a practical
bar to acceptance of the Speakership by scrupulous
persons outside the Anglican pale. Its arrogant
reference to “ Thy Church ” might, of course, be
construed by each sect (bar the R.C.’s) into a
special mention of its particular Holy of Holies,
but how are we to manage when we come down to
the sparse Swedenborgians, “ Beardies,” and the
“ other denominations ” of about one adherent or
less? Mention of “Our most blessed Lord and
Saviour, ” would surely stick in the
gullet of a Jew or Unitarian Speaker. Yet we
find persons of all creeds daily content to overlook
these insults so long as they are able to draw the
perquisites. —T.D.
The fact that a man like Graham Berry
worked close on 20 years without payment as a
member of Parliament, and took the risk of work-
ing all his life without payment, while fighting for
payment for his successors, should count for some-
thing in the discussion of his claims to a Parlia-
mentary allowance in his sere and yellow-leaf.
‘ ‘ There will be children in Hell for the
loss of whose souls this House will be responsible,”
Labor-member Price told S.A. Assembly the other
day in re the recent decision to charge all children
Is. a week for their schooling after they had
passed the compulsory standard, even though they
get there at 10 years old. Those whose parents
cannot afford to pay are forced on to the streets.
Dear Bulletin, The prevailing mis-
sionary zeal demonstrates that, though the
orthodox have practically long since abandoned
Christianity, they still consider it good enough for
the Chinese, Hindus, South Sea islanders and so
forth. No doubt there is wisdom in teaching
these inferior races to turn the other cheek ; also,
to lay up their treasure in heaven only, to forgive
their European enemies, to hand over their goods
after thev have been despoiled of their land, to
lend without interest to the European borrower,
and, in fact, to become good “ Christians ” all
round. The missionaries also have served their
purpose in facilitating the European conquest of
these countries, just as the overthrow of Rome by
the barbarians was materially aided by the pre-
vious introduction of Christianity to Italy.—
Democrat.
Britishah : “ Mr. Ranjitsinhji properly
sticks up for his fellow-subjects of Her Imperial
Majesty the Kaiser-i-Hind, in Australiah. He does
not bully, but takes the lofty stand which every
advocate of the English connexion is bound to
assume. Houng Eat and Sam Kee are aliens, who
may be legislated against anyhow, but Ghollah
and Chundah, as Imperial Britons, possess as muoh
right to have free course and be glorified in Aus-
traliah as anyone from England —that is to say, on
the assumption that Australiah belongs to England.
My gorge rises at the disgraceful way in which
Beak Panton, of Melb., hectors the hawker
Afghan, Sikh, or Pathan. Lo, the poor Indian !
Our flesh and blood. Anyone would think he was
Bill Sikhs, instead of a glorious tawny Tommy
Atkins, who has borne our magnificent colors in
the Panjab. Ranji will do incalculable good by
sticking to his new text. ”
Premier Kingston’s S.A. Gambling Sup-
pression Bill is a beautifully comprehensive slab
of moral snuffle. Penalty for betting with a
person under 21, fine of from =£lo to .£lOO or
imprisonment up to six months. Receiving money
for betting purposes from persons under 21, fine
of from £2O to ,£lOO, or same term of imprison-
ment. Promoting sweeps, =£loo or six months.
Being a private totalisator-agenr, .£2O to £lOO or
six months. And the Bill also gives the police
Eower to forcibly enter and search suspected
ouses and arrest suspected persons without war-
rant, and they may impound any articles sup-
posed to be used for gambling purposes, the onus
being laid on the accused to prove that they are not
so used. Which tremendous clause would pro-
bably justify them in seizing the table and leaving
the family to eat its meals on the mantelpiece,
till it could satisfactorily demonstrate that the
impounded piece of furniture was not habitually
used for playing penny-nap upon.
S.S. : “Sickening to bear the yapping
and snarling of some of the Melb. ’trades
Hall councillors and certain Labor mem-
bers at the heels of Trenwith. Bilious
spite is apparently the one motive —spite
that is the outcome of envy, selfishness,
and narrow political creeds. Trenwith
has climbed patiently and laboriously,
he has been true to the principles he
has professed, but because he can find
no policy in fish-market vituperation
and melodramatic posing for the delec-
tation of the ‘ push,’ he is hissed as a
traitor, and hounded as an enemy to
the Labor cause. It is counted
against him with fine scorn that
he aspires to office. How could he
serve his party better ? What could
Ballance have done for Democracy
in Maoriland as the leader of a mere
faction ? It is Trenwith’s game to
play for office, and whilst he re-
mains what he is in heart every
Radical should help him on.
Meanwhile, his enemies evinoe
their loyalty to the working-man by pulling
hideous faces at the bourgeoisie. Labor may have
a score of men who will abuse the enemy for
one who will use him.”
Premier Reid’s straight and honest and
strictly truthful statement that N.S.W. doesn’t
need foreign mining-capital has brought down a
perfect shriek of obloquy on his capacious head.
About 47 people rose simultaneously to ask how,
in the name of heaven, N.S.W. could work its
mines unless they were owned and managed by J.
Bull and the dividends went to England, and
what might not happen to the helpless Cornstalk
mining infant unless he was held up by the British
investor. The Bulletin opines that the Corn-
stalk, unless he is a hopeless fool, or a cretin, or
something of the kind, could struggle through on
his own, just as the mining men of Bendigo, Bal-
larat, Gympie, Charters Towers, and other places
did for so many years with good results. If the
people of N.S.W., after 60 years’ experience, don t
know how to run their own mines, then it is time
they were compelled to learn, and so long as they
lean in abject weakness on Bull or any other out-
sider they never will learn.

Attention is drawn in the advertising
columns to the fact that the financial year of the
A.M.P. Society is drawing to a close, and that the
date when the usual yearly investigation of its
affairs and distribution of its surplus will be made
is at hand. Intending assurers are reminded that
a bonus for the year 1897 will be allotted to every
participating policy effected not later than the 31st
December next. The amount of cash bonus dis-
tributed amongst the participating policy-holders
for the single year 1896 was no less a sum than
.£428,797. Persons who wish to avail themselves
of the benefits which membership of this well-
known society confers, and who desire to become
participants in the profit earned in the current
year, will do well to make application at the Head
Office, or any of the District Offices, or consult

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The result of the Sandhurst Cup race, run Nov.
24, is likely to be very much under the influence of Tatt’s
sweep on the event.
r • • • •
W. R. Wilson has won a number of big races,
but his bad luck with good horses is proverbial. They
seem to go wrong in the feet, or the temper, and the only
St. Alban’s “ crack ” that has “ trained on ” of late years
is the expatriated Norman. At the present time backers
are cursing the waywardness of Manfred and Majestic,
and wondering whether Aurum’s cracked hoof will soon
go wrong altogether.

At a recent Australian race-meeting widespread
surprise was expressed at the continual companionship
throughout the day of the judge and a big owner, inside
the box as well as outside. Some of the decisions also
caused much astonishment. It was a nice, bright day,
and clearer still was the fact that the judge enjoyed
being in the sun. The big owner and his particular pals
didn’t do too badly on that day, either.

Bookmakers are honest, in that they scorn to
dissemble their awful prosperity. The impoverished
punter has the real state of affairs thrust under his notice.
The fingers that grab his “quid” are heavy with expen-
sive rings ; the voice that calls the odds is lubricated with
champagne in public places. The blessed Truth stares
the punter in the face. On the Monday afternoon pre-
vious to Melb. Cup, bookmakers Sam Allen and Charley
Westbrook rode around the Collins-street Block on a
couple of tall horses, the observed of all observers.

Bathurst, last week, gave trotting one of the
few shows it gets in N.S.W. Mr. Buekland was repre-
sented by Cling and Burlington, Junior; Dr. Slate by
Narragarisett and Silver Cloud ; Mr. Fitzgerald by Huon,
Junior, and Lady Nutwood; and Mr. Knight had as sole
representative Harold 8., a rather slab-sided Childe
Harold horse, who has been raced for a couple of seasons
without success, being looked upon as a bit of an outlaw.
The fine little track on the Bathurst Show Ground was in
tip-top order, and Harold B. won the three minutes trot,
the 2.45 trot, and the exhibition for speed, style and
action ; in the latter rattling off half-a-mile in lntin.
18sec., and fairly distancing Dr. Side's Silver Cloud.
Harold B. moves more like Fritz than any other horse in N.S.
Wales, and Knight deserves much credit for his handling
of the horse, which, before it fell into his hands, had
beaten every man who had sat behind it. The Handicap
was won by Lady Nutwood, but the handicapping was so
bad that it robbed the event of all interest. The Maiden
Trot fell to Burlington, Junior, an enormous pacing
stallion by Burlington 8., and he ran the final heat in
2min. 47sec. » -

At a recent race-meeting for the benefit of
Kiama R.C. Church, Father Heydon’s horse, Turko, fell
and badly injured his jockey, hight O’Dwyer. Lot more
give-and-take about R.C.-ism, after all, than about any
other sect. Imagination can’t possibly run to “ the Rev.
Duncan M‘Parritch’s horse, Tonald, ridden by Sandy
Buchanan.” at,
* * * *
It was understood, at time of writing, that a
“ further enquiry” into the Parthenopseus scandal would
end in bookmaker Sam Allen giving tha V.R.C. a sworn
declaration that he didn’t back old Par. for the Final
Handicap, but merely saved it in his volume. Why not
call upon the Ring in general to state who did pile the
money on the horse when he won ? And how about the
Spring Handicap, for which Parthenopseus started at an
outside price and ran “ nowhere ” —did Samuel and
partner Arnfield, save their horse on that occasion ?
• * * *
The public should be grieved to hear that Mr.
Forrester was laid £3OOO to nothing against Gaulus by the
drawer of the horse in Tatt.’s big sweep. Any one of us
might happen to draw a horse in a Cup sweep, and the
horse might win—and why, in the name of Turf Morality,
should we be expected to pay Bill Forrester, or anybody
else, £3OOO in consideration of his good luck ? The con-
ditions of these big handicaps are not properly stated in
the Racing Calendar. It ought to be duly set forth that
the Melb. Cup has £3OOO added by the V.R.C., and several
other thousands added, under pressure of fear, by holders
of sweep tickets.

An impromptu set-to between a couple of pugs
took place in a Melb. pub. last week, consequent upon one
splitting the other’s lip open while his hands were in his
pockets. An adjournment was made to the nearest ring,
where a sharp knuckle-fight under otherwise Queensberry
rules occurred. The battle consisted principally of the
man with the split lip belting hunks off the aggressor—
who has by farthebiggerreputation.andwhoultimatelygot
out of a nasty hole by remarking that it wasn’t his game
to fight for fame. The other reminded him that he
should have thought of that when he started the row, and
proceeded to give it to him “ lying down,” the upshot
being an agreement to settle the question with gloves at
an early date. The prospect of an honest go, with bad
blood between the parties, ought to raise a crowd big
enough to fill the Exhibition.
* * * *
On the handicaps Walne and Kellow should
have splendid chances in this year’s Austral, and it would
be no surprise if the first and second prizes of ’97 went to
the same men as those of ’96. The men have reversed
marks this time, Kellow having 30yds. and Walne 20yds.
start from Englishman Barden on scratch. Ahead there
are such men as Tebbutt, Reynolds, Porta, Middleton,
and Walker on 40yds., so that there is first-class pacing
at their disposal. The enormous number of entries also
have scattered a number of riders on every mark, so that
in no heat will there be a break of more than 15yds.
Barden’s chance on a flat grass track is very uncertain,
but on recent form Walne holds Englishman Green safe
on the same mark. Judging by the finish in the five-mile
race at Melb. Hibernian sports last week, it is doubtful if
he does Kellow, and of the cracks entered these two seem
to have the best chance.
Both the five and ten-mile scratch races at the
Hibernian sports aforesaid fell to Walne, though Kellow
was beaten by only a tire in the shorter distance, in addi-
tion to which he protested vainly against interference on
the part of the Bananalander. The ten-mile race was
noticeable for the run-away conduct of Johnstone
“ No. 1,” who headed the field by 100yds. on two or three
occasions. In the final rush Megson came round.on the
outside to smother the field, but Walne carried too many
guns, and finished a length ahead, with Kellow third.
The cycle racing at St. Kilda,;iast Saturday,
was remarkable principally for the return to form of Ken.
Lewis, who, keeping to the training and dodging the
asthma, smothered Walne, Megson and Kellow in the
run home of the Five Mile scratch. In the mile event he
also ran well, finishing third to Walne and Kellow s first
and second. Walne seemed wanting in strength, and
was all out in the finishes of both races as well as in the
Pursuit Race, where he failed to come any nearer than
third. Megson and Kellow' are riding splendidly, but
they seem to have lost their old trackmanship, both
allowing themselves to get into execrable positions at
critical moments. Jackson, the Newhaven of the last
Austral, rode very well, coming second in the Pursuit
Race.
The Pursuit Race was the first, and is probably
the last, of the sort Melb. will ever see, for it was duller
than a yacht-race. Eight men (all the tip-toppers, with
the exception of the Englishmen, who were in Adelaide)
started at intervals around the track, and dropped out
one by one when overhauled, until only Hunt, Jackson,
and Walne were left in. Jackson was coming strongly on
Hunt when the bell rang for the expiration of the 7min.,
leaving the Maorilander the winner with 2 miles 1648yd5.,
and Jackson 198yds. behind.
The handicap races were notable for the splen-
did finishes, eight men finishing within a blanket’s length
in one heat, and the times put up. The middle-markers
did best, and the big race fell to O. Lober —over 200 in
the two-mile event, which he turned off in 4min. 29sec.,
or equal time to Kellow'’s Austral.
* * * *
Wally Kux, the Melb. road-cyclist, broke the
Adelaide-to-Melb. record, last week, in a characteristically
German manner. Kux made out a schedule of all the
townships on the route, with Snell’s time at each,
knocking a few minutes off every one, and timed him-
self to reach Melb. in 52 hours. So carefully did this
stolid Teuton adhere to his arrangement that he arrived
at the G.P.O. in 51hrs. 48min. and some odd secs., and
that after taking tw'O hours’ sleep he had not provided
for. Kux, on arrival, pedalled straight to the German
Club, where a select crowd of fellow-countrymen toasted
him with lager and sang “In der Schmertz” in chorus
until breakfast-time. Snell's previous record stood at
61hrs., and Kux’s before that at 69hrs. Snell is now pre-
paring t.o vanquish his vanquisher, and apparently the
game will continue ad infinitum.

“Oarsman” to The Bulletin The N.S.W.
Rowing Association, in presenting the “ Pennant ” with
the “ flag” (indicating the premiership of ’97), decided to
hold a dinner in celebration of the affair. Not a single
man was invited to attend this function—the winners of
the championships being required to pay in order to re-
ceive the trophy which they had won I This strikes me
as an absurdity previously unheard-of in any branch
of sport. The “crew” had resolved, in order to dis-
courage such paltriness, not to attend the dinner, and
only on the advice of the Sydney Rowing Club Committee,
which held a meeting on the subject, did they buy tickets
for the affair, which took place at Aarons’ Exchange
Hotel last Saturdav evening.
* " * * »
Stoddart, in the match with Vic., was not even
a suggestion of the batsman he used to be.
A nauseating feature of the England v. Victoria
match was the tendency of a section of the crowd to
yell itself hoarse every time Ranjitsinhji touched the
ball in the fipld. Soft ’uns that the average small boy,
playing with a kerosene-tin wicket, could take with ease
were made the subject of fulsome applause and cries of
“ What a wrist he has I” “ Wonderful 1” &c.
* * * *
The crowd can’t complain of Storer as a show-
man. He appears to revel in unnecessary work behind
the wickets, and he chases the ball whenever he has a
chance to get there half a second sooner than another
man. Also, in batting he is ever on the alert to steal a
run. A fearless, aggressive-nosed, quick-witted fellow,
who will probably “ come off ” more frequently than any
of his mates. The new men among the English pros, are
mostly fair-haired, Hirst being quite the typical Anglo-
Saxon —short and thick, with a pair of “ beautiful blue
eyes,” and the covert glances that, as a rule, fetch
responsive dittos from womankind.
* * » •
Acritioof the English men’s Vic. “order of going”
might want to know why shouldn’t the sturdily self-confi-
dent Storer be a first-man in—that is, when Stoddart wins
the toss? Storer is a rugged, rapid, and fairly safe batsman
who puts the ball in all sorts of places, and, to an outsider,
it seems that a run-getting wicket-keeper should always
open the proceedings, in order that he may have all pos-
sible chance of a long rest before putting the gloves on.
By the same token, he should be reserved for a middle
place in the second innings. Hayward and Stoddart,
judging from their form at Adelaide and Melbourne, will
seldom prove useful batsmen “ on the pinch.”
If the general opinion of Hinglish barrackers
were taken.it would be found in favor of reserving Stoddy
and the Surrey man—cramped beginners both of them—
for the time when the attack has lost some of its original
keenness. A Bulletin correspondent from Adelaide
classed Hayward as the soundest bat in the team, although
he made only 6 runs. His Melbourne results were 7 and 5,
made in an unhappy, over-anxious manner which pre-
pared the crowd for his downfall on each oc-
casion. Cricket prophecies re new men on strange
wickets are dangerous things to attempt, any-
way. The present writer merely predicts a huge
financial success for the Stoddartian tour, weather
permitting. The Englishmen-cam-Ranji promise to
play a lively game, and when they happen to get
plenty of luck they will make a fine scoring display.

Worrall’s 83 runs, in the second innings of Vic.
v. Stoddarc’s Eleven, were scored at the rate of somewhat
less than 20 to the hour. It’s a poor show for the multi-
tude when a batsman gets “ set ” to such an awfully slow
tune. They might as well have Alick Bannerinan back
again.
* * • *
Scraps of feminine cricketology in M.C.G. re-
serve at England-Vic. match. “ That man in the white
coat and dark trousers is Stoddart, dear.” It was
Crockett, the umpire. “ You see they have to hit the
ball up and down between the goal-posts.” “ Why do
they say a man is ‘ run out ’ when he walks out ?” “ Oh,
the batsman gets them (the bowling-screens) moved to
show where he wants to hit to, and then the fielders have
to stand away from them.” “ Isn’t Storer cunning 1 He
sits right down on his heels so that the wicket will protect
his face.”
* * • »
Dear Bulletin, — lie bowler Jones, you say
“ nearly every bowler whose action has been questioned
in past days had a slow delivery.” True. And many
cricket-lovers in Melbourne are asking “ What about
‘Micky’ Roche’s action, especially when he’s putting in a
slow one?” Several times during the recent match with
Stoddart’s team it was, to put it mildly, suspicious.
There was a final jerk of a bent arm which made the de-
livery, at least, open to doubt. We saw it from many
angles, and with and without glasses. Roche is again an
M.C.C. pro. while here, umpire Phillips an ex-M.C.C.
pro., and umpire Crockett a present M.C.C. pro. Did
any of the visiting team think in silence ? Has anyone
an opinion to offer? Isthe “ clever throw” creeping in?—
Bails.
* * * *
When Giffen’s Australian team went to the
West last year the players—most of them Australian
Eleven men—agreed upon a fixed amount they were each
to demand this year in the Stoddart matches, but it is
stated that some of the men, when separately interviewed
by Wardill, went back on their confreres. This is one of
the items in George Giffen’s comprehensive grievance.
* * * *
The glorious uncertainty of cricket—and um-
pires: In the England v. N.S.W. match Iredale was
caught behind wickets off a ball which he afterwards
admitted having just touched, but was given “ not out.”
His dismissal was from an l.b.w. appeal, confirmed by the
umpire, when he really played the ball on to his pad.
• • • *
The N.S.W. men should undoubtedly have made
more of their chance on the first day of the match with
the Stoddartians. They had the bowling beaten, the
wicket was very fast, and boundary hits came easily, and
yet they made only 303 runs. The visitors’rate of scoring
next day was nearly 30 per cent, faster.
• • • •
The fact of young Trumper being sent first to
the wickets in the Sydney match against the Englishmen
caused much argument in cricketing circles. Many
thought it a grave error of judgment to send the lad in
first; others were of opinion that it was better for him
to go in and have it over than to sit and wait for his turn.
A vexed question is—Should veteran Garrett
now stand down for younger men, despite his fine second
innings? Unfortunately, Garrett is one of the selection
committee, and his playing only bears out The Bulletin’s
old contention that no probable player should have a
place on a selection committee. “No man is a competent
judge in his own cause.”
From all accounts, it was touch and go as to the
inclusion of Donnan, whose 104 pulled N.S.W.’s first
innings out of the fire.
The spectacle of the crowd cheering Ranjit-
sinhji is deplorable. The unfortunate “ prince ” cannot
show himself, or do anything, or do nothing without the
crowd applauding. Really, does not the Australian
crowd deserve the contempt that the Englishmen feel in
their hearts for it ?
Not alone in the Trumper incident was Gar-
rett’s captainship provocative of endless criticism. Some
people said his captaining was as bad as his catching ; but
this probably goes too far. The biggest howls certainly
arose from duffers who couldn’t have done half as well;
but a knowledge of that fact—if they know it —made no
difference to the crowd. There’s no medium in a cricket
critic who has backed his judgment with a shilling at the
gates ; and he makes no allowance for weather, or luck,
or the chapter of accidents. Play is either “ brilliant ”or
“ rotten "—mostly rotten. And one miss wipes out the
memory of a hundred well-fought matches.
Friday’s play left N.S.W. at 5 wickets for 303.
By this time every man in Australia but the lonely bush-
man sitting down to damper and spotted ‘‘goanna”
knows that the next 5 wickets added only 8
runs. For the collapse the weather—and the bats-
men—accounted. The rained -on pitch was tricky ;
the bowlers were fresh ; and down went the wickets.
Richardson’s third ball delivered Kelly into Storer’s
hands ; Coningham—O Pyjamaland I—retired for 0 with
a gentle tip to the bowler; Mackenzie’s wicket suddenly
lay down, and refused to get up again ; a black arm ex-
tended like a semaphore and clutched Garrett; and
Howell allowed M’Kibbin to carry out his bat. Half the
Eleven lay peacefully under wet turf, with a neat little
tablet erected to their memory by Hearn e and Richard-
son.
The Englishmen, who had fielded anyhow and
nohow, and bowled for the most part merely somehow,
did rather better with the bat. Their innings totalled
335, or 24 more than the local men made. M’Laren’s
slashing 142 was its feature, and when Iredale at last held
him relief shone visibly on every perspiring N.S.W. figure-
head. McKibbin’s bowling was worse than Noble’s, and
Noble’s was none too good ; Howell and colt Trumper—
who dismissed Hayward with a splendid catch —got little
show and none respectively. Storer played a good 84.
N.S.W. did worse second innings than first, and
could only tot up 260; whereupon the Englishmen came
with a rush and carried off the match by eight wickets.
Ranji. gave a taste of his quality for the first time in Aus-
tralia and made 112 (not out). The wicket played more
like a billiard-table than a cricket-pitch, and when Ranji.
and Maclaren got together they simply beat the bowling,
Maclaren running up his even hundred before Noble
knocked his wicket down. Mason joined the Indian,
but only scored four when Noble found his weak spot.
Hayward then took a hand with Ranji. and the pair
played out the game in the interests of the durned
Britisher as aforesaid. Ranji. played a faultless innings,
and justified the hatsful of gate-money he has drawn to
the ground.

Ballina, Thursday.—An inquest was held yesterday at
Rous on the body of a man named Johnson, who commit-
ted suicide by cutting his throat to-day.
When it was proposed, in a certain N.S. W.
town, to buy a chandelier for the Town Hall, the
Teutonic Mayor said : “ Veil, here ve haf a biano,
und ve can’t afford to keep any von to blay it; zo,
if ve puy von zhantelier, who vill blay dat ? ”
i Dear Bulletin, — lie filthy dairies, etc.
Have you ever seen a cream-separator cleaned
after it has been running an hour or two? On
opening, the plates are covered and the bowl filled
with a horrid greenish-grey slimy mass which the
creamery-manager usually feeds to hiss poultry,
who eat it greedily. Under the private dairy
system of non-separated cream, most of this filth
goes into the butter ; which doubtless accounts for
so many bucolics preferring dairy-made to factory
butter. —F.C.
Panton, P.M., in declaring that a wife’s
adultery does not exempt a husband from pay-
ment of maintenance, has raised an outburst of
dissent among Melbourne lawyers. Yet he is
right, and has the Vic. Full Court with him. By
a decision not a year old the tribunal named de-
cided that a man is liable to a maintenance order
until divorced, but, at the same time, it reduced
an order for 7s. 6d. a week, made at North Melb.
police court, to a farthing a week. The gleeful
defendant rolled up to court and, planking down
a shilling on the clerk’s desk, said “Here’s just
about a year in advance.”
Premier Kingston, as the result of recent
deputations from the W.C.T.U., &e., recently in-
troduced a drastic liquor bill into S. A. Assembly.
Any person now found in an hotel on Sunday un-
less a lodger or a traveller is “ deemed to have
committed an offence,” so that the pious Adelaide
citizen who steps into the vestry of a pub. to
ascertain the whereabouts of the nearest church is
deemed to be intoxicated and riotous, and may be
arrested by the nearest policeman. The police
can also enter a pub., search it, and arrest every
person therein at any time without a warrant.
Apparently the only device left to the Adelaide
man with a dark-brown Sunday-morning taste in
his mouth is to enter a pub. and search it with a
policeman, and arrest the nearest bottle of beer on
suspicion of felony.
“ 6 x 8 ” on an industrial subject :
Dear Bulletin, —Do you know what “ etc.” stands for
in the following sort of daily-paper advts. : “ Wanted,
youth for station, to milk, ride, etc., ss. a week.” For
the edification of Westward-bound Sydney youths, I’ll
tell you. This kind of much-advertised-for youth does
little riding or milking on a station. He might have to
milk an ancient cow or two, and once a day ride a more
ancient station crock to run ’em in. His main five-
shillings’ worth consists of “ etc.,” viz., getting up at day-
break (4 a.m. in the summer-time), cutting kindle-wood
for house and kitchen, lighting two or three fires, shining
from six to a dozen pairs of boots, peeling potatoes, clean-
ing knives and forks and all brass-work about the home-
stead, and feeding fowls, pigs, dogs, and pet sheep. After
breakfast, his day’s work of “ etc.” begins in real earnest.
He has to clean the verandah and yards and lawns ; then
wash a buggy or two, grease a few sets of harness and two
or three saddles ; and, if he’s smart, he might get a spell
before dinner, i.e., nursing a baby or wheeling a peram-
bulator about. After dinner, he helps the cook washing
up, cleans some more knives and forks, and passes time
till evening by cutting and carting wood, weeding the
garden, watering flowers, hunting for hen-eggs, grooming
ladies’ hacks, unpacking stores, killing sheep, and pump-
ing and carting water for the laundress. After tea, more
washing-up, taking clothes off the line, or perhaps turning
a mangle for an hour or two.

It affords me very great pleasure to hear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured

THIS Company is being formed for the purpose
of acquiring the property of the Cobar
Mining Company, No Liability, comprising the
following leases on the Cobar Goldfield :
aggregating a total of
98 acres O rood 38 perches,
also, a Freehold grant of 100 acres, adjoining the
above-mentioned leases, favorable for a mill-site,
and containing a dam capable of holding about
three million gallons of water. The purchase also
embraces the plant and machinery now on the
mine, including three batteries, each of five head
of stampers, a Huntingdon mill, together with
pumps, boilers, engines, &c.
The object of the Company will be to work the
large auriferous and cupriferous deposits contained
in the leases on an extensive and scientific system,
to which purpose the works and machinery neces-
sary will be erected. The property has been care-
fully examined by a number of the most competent
experts in Australia, who are unanimous in their
appreciation of the intrinsic merit of the mine, as
will be seen from their reports hereto appended.
The main lode of the mine, which has been well
described in the past by no less an authority than
Mr. H. C. Callahan, manager of the Lake View
Consols Mine at Kalgoorlie, as “ the Mother Lode
of New South Wales,” is one of the largest in
Australia. Under the old company it was worked
for gold, no copper having appeared on the sur-
face, whilst the gossany slates were richly
auriferous.
With depth, however, occurred a change in the
character of the ore, the gold becoming asso-
ciated with copper and other metals, from which
it could not be readily separated and extracted by
amalgamation. The New Company will, there-
fore, treat the ore on an entirely different prin-
ciple, and, under advice of the most capable
metallurgists, the whole system of extraction will
be altered. The ore will be smelted ; and the
working capital has been calculated with a view
to the erection of electrolytic works, should the
management deem them advisable.
The success of another property upon the same
lode, the Great Cobar Copper Mine, is a fitting
standard for comparison. That mine has a
remarkable historical, as well as geological, simi-
larity to the Cobar Chesney. Both on the same
lode, in one of the most gifted of the mining dis-
tricts of the colony, they had previously been
closed down, after years of comparatively ineffec-
tive working, for identical reasons—the heavy cost
of treatment, the paucity of general facilities, and
the enormous expense of transporation prior to
the construction of the railway. The loss of the
gold values in the Great Cobar, owing to the high
proportion of copper, and the refractory nature of
the ore in the Cobar Chesney, were the immediate
causes for suspending work in the mines. The
former has since been reopened on behalf of the
tributors with immense success.
The reports which, with plans and sections,
accompany the prospectus, are the expression of
seven of the most careful and capable mining
managers, engineers, and metallurgists available
in Australia, and that they are unanimous in
their appreciation places beyond doubt the in-
trinsic value of the mine. The authors of the re-
ports are :
Mr. William H. Trewenack, General Manager
of the Lake George United Mines, New South
Wales.
Mr. Louis Janin, Junior, author of “ Amal-
gamation of Free Milling Gold Ores,” and other
mining works, one of the discoverers of the
Cyanide Process, and whose metallurgical and
mining work in America has placed him in the
same rank as Dr. Peters, Junior, to whom the
present position of Mt. Lyell mine is largely due.
Mr. Thomas Longworth, General Manager of
the Great Cobar Copper Mine, New South Wales.
Mr. Randolph Adams, late Manager of the>
Broken Hill Central Mine, and well-known Copper
Mining Expert of America.
Mu. J. E. O’Gorman, formerly of the State
Mining Bureau of California, and General
Manager of the Cobar Gold Mines, Limited.
Mr. G. A. Stockfkld, one of the pioneers of
Western Australia, and recently leader of a
mining expedition through South Africa, in con-
nection with the British South Africa Chartered
Company.
Captain Henry Cock, formerly manager of
copper mines in Cornwall, and of gold mines in
Bendigo.
Reports.
Mr. WM. H. TREWENACK, Manager of the
Lake George Mines, Limited, writes: —Some months
back I made an exhaustive examination of the
property, not with a view of making a report for
flotation purposes, but to assure myself of the
value or otherwise of the mineral deposits within
the Company’s property. Its surface indications
are strongly marked, inasmuch as they are gos-
sany, having a long length and great width. The
gossany ores were worked for free gold formerly
by the Company, then by tributors, and the
average recovered value from data furnished me
was equal to 7dwts. gold per ton. This, however,
did not represent the true value of the ore won
from the several shoots of ore followed down, for
I made a complete sampling of the tailings at the
mill, the assays from which were certainly astonish-
ing. Apparently the recovery had not been more
than CO to 65 per cent, of the absolute value of the
ore. I consider there are large quantities of this
class of ore, and immense reserves of lower grade
still left standing in the upper workings of the
mine. Since no copper or excess iron are shown
in the upper workings, the most suitable means of
recovery should be —(Ist) by milling the crude
stone through a modern American type mill;
(2nd) the tailings should then be subjected to
Cyanidation.
At 150 ft. from the surface I noticed stains of
copper shown in the form of carbonates. Seeing
this led me still further in my pursuits, and red
oxides were then noticed. At 260 ft., or there-
abouts, ohalcopyrite, coated with rich black sul-
phides, were seen, assaying high for both copper
and gold. At 360 ft. a crosscut was run west ex-
posing a vein 32ft. to 34ft. in width, carrying on
an an average 5 per cent, copper and 3rlwts. to
4dwts. gold per ton. A large portion of this vein
matter can be easily and cheaply dressed by con-
centration. The more massive sulphide portion
can be broken down at the point of the pick, and
so be sent to the blast furnaces direct, thereby
saving handling and further surface costs. The
concentrated portions can be put in such a form
that no one need have fear of meeting with any
blast furnace difficulties, and the ore can be so
regulated by concentration, that—after some little
experience has been gained by the millmen —suffi-
cient silica shall be left in the ore to form its own
silicious flux for the furnace work.
Taking into consideration the enormous width
of the lode formation, length of ore body shown,
and the important change that has taken place in
the deep workings of the property, copper ore
having been developed in payable quantities asso-
ciated with gold, one could come to no other con-
clusion than that the Chesney Mine will become
one of the largest and constant producers within
the Cobar district. To gain this object, however,
shaft-sinking and general exploration work should
be pushed ahead as fast as possible. The owners
need have no fear of the ore bodies in the deeper
workings. The gold will carry down in the
copper ore, and in all probability these ores will
become more massive as depth is attained. With
good economical management, and with skill
shown in the metallurgical treatment of the ore,
this mine can be made to pay handsomely from
the start of operations.
The Mine, 3rd November, 1897.
Mr. LOUIS JANIN, Jun., Mining Engineer
•and Metallurgist, reports as follows :—I may pre-
face my report by saying that I am highly pleased
with the prospects of this mine, particularly with
its resources as a copper-mine. I am fully of
opinion that this property will be one of the first
three Copper-Gold Mines of New South Wales, if
taken over by a Company which cah supply the
necessary large working capital and worked under
intelligent management.
That the Chesney Mine was not recognised to
be a copper mine at its start is not difficult to see.
In many mining districts, to which the Cobar
District is no exception, several classes of ore
occur, each on its own horizontal plane, and each
to a certain more or less defined depth. In the
case of the Great Cobar Copper Mine, which is
nearly 200 ft. lower than the Chesney Mine, the
soft gossans were eroded, leaving the rich car-
bonate ore belonging to the second zone exposed
on the surface. The Chesney Mine still has these
gossans, which, as in the case of the Cobar Gold
Mines Limited, Fort Bourke Mine, show no
copper for a considerable depth.
As in the Great Cobar Mine, the vein in the
Chesney is wide, but of varying width. These
walls will average over 100 ft. apart. At the No.
3 Shaft the width between these limits is over
200 ft., with auriferous gossan exposed on the sur-
face, over 150 ft. in width. These gossans have
been cut at the 100 ft. level 115 ft. wide. At the
No. 1 Main Shaft the lode is 87ft. wide. Of
course, in such large ore bodies masses of mullock
or waste rock are bound to occur, but, with due
allowance for this, these ore bodies remain among
the greatest I have seen in copper-bearing lodes.
The Great Cobar Mine shows over 75ft. of solid
ore in its 540 ft. level, and, judging from the sur-
face and underground developments of the
Chesney, there will be a greater width of lode at
the same level in the latter mine. I have no
doubt that these deposits will be worked eventu-
ally to great depths.
The treatment of this class of ore is simple, but
requires intelligent and trained management.
If we assume that one ton of each of the samples,
most carefully taken by myself, and assayed under
my direction, were smelted together without re-
gard to fluxes, the results would be as follows -.

or 3oz. ldwt. 18grs. per ton of copper. The
average assay is 3'Gdwts. per ton of ore.
The Great Cobar Copper Mine worked by
tributors treated in the past year, approximately,
69,000 tons of ore were smelted for, approximately,
2700 tons of copper. The gross profits for the
period are estimated at =892,000. The average
assay for gold in the Chesney is approximately the
same as in the Cobar Copper Mine.
I estimate the cost of producing a ton of electro-
lytic copper, and landing it in London, is =835185.,
from which must be deducted the value of the gold
contents of the copper bars which will be saved in
U,H making a net cost of
A 24 10s. bd. I have allowed 12s. a ton for mining •
this is an outside estimate.
The Detailed Estimate is as Follows :
Cost of mining and hand-sorting 25 tons of ore
At 12s. ... ... _ £l5 0
Cost of smelting 15 tons of ore, including heap-
roasting ... ... ... * 10 10
Cost of Bessemerising 2J tons of matte 4 4
Transportation of black copper to Lithgow o 14
Electrolysis of black copper at Lithgow 2 10
Commission, freights, &c., to London 3 0
Total cost of electrolytic bars £35 is 0
From which must be deducted the value of the
separated gold extracted from 15 tons of ore
each containing 3'6dwts. ... ’ 11 7 6
£24 10s. 6d.
I have calculated the expenses at a maximum
and results at a minimum.
At the present market price of copper, if the
mine is worked on a scale of 2000 tons a week, as
is proposed, these figures mean an annual profit of
=£90,000. With skilled management and the large
working capital which will be supplied, I feel
quite confident that my estimate will prove not to
be exaggerated.
Having all these facts under consideration, I
have no hesitation in recommending the Cobar
Chesney Mine as a most valuable property, with
very great potentialities.
Mr. RANDOLPH ADAMS reports :—Viewing
the property in general, I should say the future
policy should be to treat the mine as a sulphide
copper mine carrying gold, the latter metal being
extracted with copper as a base. This appears
clearly proven by the smelting work on the Cobar
Copper Mine, as now carried out. In this mine,
below the sulphide zone, the ore bodies are open
from 40 to 100 ft. in width, in clean, massive sul-
phide of iron, carrying sulphide of copper and a
little gold throughout. The presence of iron in
large quantities allows a general blending of
gossans, carbonate ore, and sulphides, forming a
mixture most readily and cheajjly reduced by
ordinary shaft furnace smelting.
The alterations shown in the Cobar mine from
gossans to carbonate ore, and finally to massive
sulphide, are precisely duplicated in the Chesney
mine.
The mine, even as at present developed, I con-
sider a most valuable and legitimate mining pro-
position, although the past work is really only
superficial so far as proving the mine is concerned.
If the deeper work is carried out there is an ■
assurance of adding quickly to the value of the
property, not only by proving sulphide deposits,
but by furnishing a general combination of sul-
phide and oxidised ores, more economically treated
than could be done with the present exposed
reserves.
The great width of the deposit is proven both at
the surface and at all the levels so far opened.
The enclosing slate country is very regular in
formation, and carries the lode with a very slight
deviation from the vertical, so there is little ques-
tion of it being permanent in depth.
Mr. Thomas Longworth, manager of the
Great Cobar Company, asserts the opinion that
the Chesney lode “is the same lode as that run-
ning through the Great Cobar Copper Mining
Company, which is known as the eastern lode.
The probabilities are that at a greater depth this
ore body will make into a solid body of iron
pyrites, carrying good copper.”
Mr J. F. O’Gorman, manager of the Cobar
Gold Mines, Ltd., says :—The width of vein at
the 350 ft. level is 35ft., all payable, and a first-
class concentrating and smelting ore of higher
grade than in the Cobar mine. Below the mill, in
a flat, are 30,000 tons of railings that will average
Bdwts. These are a valuable asset to the mine.
Mr. Gerhard A. Stockfeld points out, “as a
fact worth serious consideration, that the Cobar
Chesney Mine stands at present in a very similar
position to that occupied within the last few years
by several of the most prominent copper mines of
Australia, such as the Cobar Copper Mining Com-
pany, the Lake George, and others, which, by
dint of the application of superior knowledge of
their requirements, combined with the expendi-
ture of sufficient capital to properly develop and
equip them in such a manner as to render
them capable of yielding an enormous output,
have, from being almost unpayable and abandoned
properties, taken a place among the copper mines
of the world, which, to the public at large, has
come as a gigantic surprise. That the Chesney
Mine is fit to rank with those above-mentioned is
a question long settled in the minds of those who
have thoroughly studied it, and that it will even-
tually do so is also equally certain, and I can con-
fidently recommend the Mine as offering every
chance of success. ”
Mr. Henry Cock asserts :—“ The ore bodies are
simply enormous. It is the largest gold and
copper lode I have seen in Australia. In size and
continuity it much resembles the great silver lode
of Broken Hill. Its size is subject to considerable
variation, but, comparatively speaking, it is a big
lode even in its smallest part. I have no doubt
whatever that it is the same lode as that worked
by the Great Cobar Mine, and that the point of
dislocation will be found by later developments/ 1

Tales of the convict system, by
Pbic® Wabung ; Is. 3d. posted.
Writes “ Gumleaf ” :—
Ed. Bulletin, —The parsonic grip on the throat of civi-
lisation relaxes slowly but surely. I have been taking-
notes at various religious gatherings in Melbourne lately,
and at every one of them heard some pitiful wail about
decreasing attendance and the diminishing amounts
which the threat of everlasting damnation can wring out
of those who do attend. Those anfflinic creatures, the
Christian Endeavorer creatures, bemoan with sickly voice
the loss of the male element from the matrimonial agency
known to them as the “ C.E.” Same lament ran through
proceedings of Anglican Synod and Congregational Union.
All afraid of Marcus Clarke’s “Civilisation without
Delusion.” But education will be too strong for the par-
sonic delusion, as it has been for the witch and wizard
delusion. Dr. Bevan, in his address on “ Religious
thought in England,” altogether burked this question,
except insofar as he admitted that everywhere gatherings
of a religious character have a larger proportion of the
feminine element than the masculine, which fact he
attempted to account for by the astounding crammer
that such is always the case in “gatherings of a more
intellectual character.”
It looks as if success at last awaits the
ceaseless efforts of devoted Mme. Dreyfus to estab-
lish her husband’s innocence of vending military
secrets to Germany. An impression prevails
that the unfortunate artillery-captain was made a
scapegoat for some influential person ; but, whether
or not, it is certain that if his wife hadn’t
; gallantly tackled on his behalf Tsar, Kaiser, and
Pope, Dreyfus would have been allowed to rot out
the short remainder of bis life in the cruellest !
durance on earth—the Cayenne convict-hell.
They were two gallant Permanent Artil'
j lerymen who had been spending a pleasant after-
! noon in Sydney and were now on their way back
to the defence station at Middle Head. They
walked unsteadily on, and sat down obtrusively
at the extreme end of the boat. One was a small
chap, with a warlike air and a very red nose.
He had just had enough grog to make him argu-
mentati ve, and was becoming quite eloquent on the
subject of defence. His mate, a long, sleepy-look-
ing individual, was in a different stage of drunken-
ness, and he sat down in a hog-like manner and
refused to be drawn into any argument. The
little fellow started about the Russians. “Sup-
pose,” said he, “that I wus the General and that
you wus a captain under me, and the Russians
wus coming up the coast in big ships to take
Sydney. Suppose I sed to you ‘ Captain, there’s
2000 men. You’ve got to lick those beggars—fire
low and knock ’em out or any other way ’—-What
would yer do? Would yer let ’em come into the
’arbour ’ere, or would yer let ’em go down to
Bot’ny and land there ? Now which ’d yer do ? ”
“ I’d let ’em do what they damn well pleased,”
growled the Captain. “ Well! Yes ! that’s not
’er bad move,” said the little ’un, loftily. “But
suppose yer was Captain again, and I wus over
yer.” The Captain grunted. “Suppose I wus
the General,” continued the diminutive would-be
commander, “and I sed to yer, ‘Look ’ere, Cap-
tain. There’s the Russians out there and you’ve
got to keep them outside those heads—I’ old you
responsible for the safety of this ’ere ’arbour.’
Wot would you do then ? ” The Captain thumped
the seat savagely with his fist. “I’d tell yer to go
and get d” he yelled. The General suddenly
lost confidence in himself as a commander.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty of breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate r, ,ief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a com-
plete cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and
irritation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic.
No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning,
a dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is
certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful,
and shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—
Yours truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“After suffering from Asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne's Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which
was in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not
had the slightest return of it. The Medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.
—ALEX. J. ANDERSON, Geelong', Victoria.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-

The Klondike Miner’s Evensong.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
* “Old Man” Eli’s claim (No. 17, or “Dollar-to-the-
Pan ”) on Hunker’s Creek, in the Klondike region. Six
o’clock of an evening, last August, when the sun—con-
cealed for all the rest of the day behind encircling snow-
capped hills —is at last seen in the western outlet of the
canon—the signal for the miners to knock off for supper,
which is generally digested—and it takes a lot of that —
over a game of poker or pedro.
We rustle an’ cuss an’ shiver
Twelve hours of a cheerless day,
Till the sun has struck the river,
And we sling our picks away ;
And up from the shafts we tumble
An’ rub from our han’s the dirt ;
I never hear no man grumble
When it’s time to dry his shirt!
Why—talk o’ the Forty-niner !
His work, alongside this,
Was Sambo a-kissin’ Dinah,
When Dinah calls the kiss !
If his leads ran topsy-turvy,
Our gravel’s fruz’ right through !
We’ve to wrestle with the scurvy—
He’d wholesome greens to chew !
But set the fire a-crackle,
An’ bile tea-leaves fer tea !
Weak tea and cussed hard tack’ll
Still make a meal fer me 1
But gosh ! If I ain’t mistaken,
Pard’s down to something there;
Ain’t that the smell o’ bacon,
That perfumes all the air ?
An’ now, as the ole camp-kettle
Is coolin’ —l git warm !
Them sizzlin’ rashers settle
On my “ rock ” in fust-class form.
Here’s Jake from the deep-down level—
How do ? Jake winks an eye—
Holds up his han’—the devil 1
If it ain’t a bottle o’ rye I
So kick the fire up, hearty !
An’ Joe, pull out the deck !
What I drop to this card-party
Won’t be paid with no blamed cheque !
Fer back o’ the ole man’s bunker
There’s a bean-bag full o’ gold—
Gold ! Here’s good health to Hunker—
There’s more down there in the cold !
This camp is an Eldorado,
But—what’s in a golden name ?
’Tis a valley still o’ the shadow,
If God don’t mark our game ;
Fer I tell ye straight an’ truly
(An’ face it, boys, we must!)
If the boat is late nex’ July,
We’ll have to grub on dust!
An’ then, where we worked, a-shiver,
Deep down from the eye o’ day,
The moon ’ll wink on the river,
An’ the lispin’ waves ’ll say :
“ Them boys is a-sleepin’ steady ;
They are millionaires, but they,
Havin’ banked their piles already,
Can’t tote their banks away ! ”
So put up the cards, you sinners !
An’ down on yer knees, jest so !
An’ pray fer yer gol’-darned dinners,
A-squattin’ there in a row !
Fer I tell ye straight an’ truly,
If the ice shud walk out slow,
An’ the boats ain’t up in July,
’Frisco’s not where you will go !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Db. Gallipot, the other day, wrote what he reck-
lessly considered a snappy article, and sent it
along to the Byalong Free and Independent.
The editor saw at a glance it would make up
about three columns, looked at the signature,
thankfully put his scissors down and pushed the
paste-pot further out of his way. He didn’t have
time to read it, unless he sacrificed his customary
afternoon doze in the office chair. In next issue
appeared the long rigmarole under the headingof—
Grave and Gay.
SARCASM AND SATIRE LET LOOSE.
By Charles Gallipot, M.B.
People couldn’t well help noticing the huge slab of
waste ink, occupying nearly half of the back page.
Some imagined it about one thing and others took
it for something else, but no one read it, and
everyone congratulated the doctor so warmly that
he really wished he had taken up literature in-
stead of medicine as a profession. There were a
few who waded in and wrestled with the first
paragraph or two, but an unfortunate impression
existed that the article was a medical treatise or
something of the sort. Consequently the pearls
of satire, which occurred in the third column,
were entirely lost.
Jonks, the banker, whose eye that morning
caught the word “grave” on top of the page,
jumped to the conclusion that it must be a protest
against the disgraceful sanitary condition of the
town. He met the doctor in the street and con-
gratulated him on his “public spiritedness.”
“ Give it ’em hot, Doc. ; wake ’em up. The town’s
worse than a blooming stinkpot! ” The doctor
smiled inanely and wondered what the devil Jonks
meant, anyhow ; but thought it some slangy ex-
pression of approval.
After dinner the doctor awaited some comment
on his literary efforts from Mrs. Gallipot, but the
difficulty of making the waistband of the doctor’s
evening trousers ever meet again was troubling her
sorely, and her thoughts were far away. So he
mentioned the subject himself.
“ What did you think of it, Annie ? ” he asked.
“It was very interesting indeed, dear; but
what was it about ? ”
“What was it about?” he scowled; “didn’t
you read it ? ”
“ Yes, dear, of course ; but I wanted you to ex-
plain it,” she said pleasantly, with a kindly smile.
“ ‘ Explain it ’ ! Devils and thunderstorms 1
There were three whole columns of explanation,
and you ask a silly question like that! ”
“ There you go, losing your temper again because
I only wanted to know what you meant.”
“ What I meant! ”
“ Yes, dear, why did you write it ? It was very
clever; but you know how silly I am. I didn’t
quite follow it, you know. You said something
about hotels and" barmaids and ballet-girls, and in
the next column you mentioned Mr. Gladstone.
What was that for? I didn’t know he was a
publican or an actor. I got quite mixed. I’m
awfully silly, I know. You never trouble to
explain things to me ”
The doctor, on the border-land of insanity, was
plucking his hair out by the roots, when the
patient’s bell rung, and he bounded out of the room
with a demoniac expression on his face.
Mrs. Gallipot thinks the doctor is becoming
more irritable every day.”
Harper’s Weekly depicts Bull with a
Jubilee nightmare of an Indian cobra.
The Salvation Army gets madder as it
gets further West. Out Barcoo way red-shirted
dervishes have taken to masquerading in the
names of prominent politicians and others. Thus
you will be noisily invited by a “ Lord Caring-
ton ” or a “ Chicago Dibbs ” to “do a volley,” or
will be regaled with the life history—the crimes
especially—of “His Nibs Jersey.” Poke-bonneted
women strive to similarly entertain under. the
assumed names of the female leaders of society,
and the most plain and ordinary and yellow poke-
bonnetted female of the lot would as soon call
herself Sarah Bernhardt as anything else. There
is no sense of incongruity about the woman who
struggles heavenward with a straw coal-scuttle on
her head and a discordant top-note in her mouth.
Whom the Gods Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Once, when canvassing for a sewing-machinefirm.
I called at a house in a Melbourne suburb. The
lady of the house—a pretty girl of 22 or 23
answered the door.
No, she didn’t want a sewing-machine ; she had
one already. But—it was out of order; did Ido
repairs? I would be glad to have a look at it and
let her know what could be done.
And as I took the machine to pieces I was all
the while watching the girl’s face, fascinated by
its look of pure, complete happiness.
I mentioned her husband, asking if he were a
mechanic, and the lovelight in her eyes was
glorious to see ; then she blushed a rosy red, and
replied, “0 yes, Dick can do almost anything.”
Finally, when I could find no more excuse for
watching the happy face, I took away a broken
cogwheel, promising to bring a duplicate the
following week.
That day week, looking over the morning paper,
I was surprised to see that “Dick” —whose full
name and address corresponded with that in my
book —had been arrested for bigamy, at the
instance of his first wife. Curious, and somewhat
anxious, to see how the little woman would take
it, I approached the house slowly ; but I need not
have worried, for I found all the blinds down, and
neighbors whispering volubly about the villainy of
men.
“ Pretty ” was dead !
Some people have all the luck.

The Commercial Travellers’ Association of
N.S.W. has an organ, the Commercial, which,
under the literary guidance of P. J. Holdsworth,
heroically endeavors to etherealize, by means of
learned dissertations on Shakespeare and so on,
the drummer’s sordid and unlovely soul. Let not
Holdsworth cast thus his pearls. Wanted —a

—that he is usually mean. Now, he isn’t. Writer
has known a Chow fruit-vendor, to whom half a
Western town was indebted for supplies, and
John never sued a man. T’other day, Shing Kee,
of Townsville, instructed solicitor Jarvis to take
proceedings, on behalf of Whay Kong, against a
certain Caucasian, for assault. Shing Kee not
only paid counsel’s fee, but also handed final costs
of J 62 Bs. Bd. to hospital. And Townsville identi-
ties swear such a thing hasn’t been done by a
European in the memory of man.

Mr. Hutchinson, of King-street, Newcastle, chemist and
druggist, was called on by a representative of a Sydney paper to get
some information regarding his marvellous recovery from a long and
severe illness. Mr. Hutchinson said, in answer to our inquiry, that
he was fifty-two years of age in January last, and that during the
last nine years he had been a great sufferer from liver trouble, which
got so bad that his skin became perfectly yellow, and he was so weak
that he could scarcely walk. He suffered also from terrible pains in
the shoulders, and had awful splitting headaches. At times he would
become terribly depressed in spirits, and felt that he was at death’s
door. Mr. Hutchinson continued this way for years, and, notwith-
standing the fact that he tried every possible remedy, and consulted
the best physicians in Australia, he continued to get worse, until in
desperation, hearing of the marvellous cures that Gould’s Tiny Tonic
Puls had wrought in others, he decided to give them a trial. The
fetter written by Mr. Hutchinson himself reads as follows:

The King of Carabas.
[FOR THE BOLLETIN.]
■‘Wanted—a truthful epitaph for defunct royalty.”—
Morrison Davidson.
And so the King of Carabas is dead,
Bewept by other kings and queens in dozens;
In grief profound the nation bows its head,
And pensions off his five-and-forty cousins,
While Sorrow slowly beats her muffled drum,
And bids the people weep in slimy lane and slum.
He loved not much, but many. In his day,
I rom high-born damsels down to Sue and Sally,
He ran the gamut in his princely way,
And knew each shapely ankle in the ballet ;
His judgment was superb on waists and wine,
Tiie dainty “ fatted calf ” he deemed a thing divine.
He loved the turf, and all the band of Sport
Revered him as of festive life the patron ;
For much he lingered round each gay resort
And scandalised each pious ancient matron.
The Course and all its crew he made a Regal Ring,
Among the jocks he rose—aye, every inch a king !
He laughed at learning, but he lived for Art;
There was no man in all that mighty nation
Could better judge how tailor did his part,
Or fold a tie so sweetly on occasion ;
Was none could half so deftly wield a cue,
Or read in Beauty’s blush if Beauty painted true.
How free he was from pride ! He once confessed
To break the bars of rank was his ambition,
And therefore he preferred plebeians blest
With surplus cash to any poor patrician;
“ I owe my people love ! ” his polished accents
fell—
(How much he owed in coin no soul could ever
tell).
And so the King of Carabas is dead
And grief has rent the great heart of the nation,
And sundry butchers bitter tears have shed,
And paupers weep in endless desolation ;
While fellow Regal Vultures wail the Thing
That one time wore a crown and called itself a
King.
Q-
P. LUFTIG.
“ Werrimee,” to The Bulletin :
A few days before Onepah (N.S.W.) shed cut-out, the
Ooss went round collecting money for Tibooburra hospital.
Everybody gave something except the three men at the
wool-table. They had subscribed at Whittabrunah, and
refused to part a second time within the month. Where-
upon the boss told ’em straight that he intended to join
those squatters who were organising to make it compul-
sory for every man in work to subscribe a certain amount
to the local hospital. This cuts two ways. A man may
be in a shed only long enough to earn 'his subscription,
and be sent on the track the worse for his labor in vain,
or he may work a week in one shed, a week in another,
and so on ; to fork out at each place for the local institu-
tion. The practice is fast becoming universal ; and the
“ reference ” or “ character ” of the future, to be of value,
must set forth in effect the important essential—“ Liberal
subscriber to the local hospital” (“as enforced by P.U.
regulations ” need not be added).

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Into the deserted waiting-room, where the
evening shadows were deepening, a woman came
with a slow, uneven footstep. She was the last
patient but one, and even as she crossed the
threshold she heard the door of the doctor’s con-
sulting-room close behind the final case for the
day, and knew that she had already faded out of
the busy man’s mind.
She was only one of many, and her case was not
even an individual one. Daily such conditions as
hers came under the doctor’s notice, and he for-
got her before she had passed out into the hall.
Her fine grey eyes were dazed ; her beautiful
mouth, made to curve so graciously, drooped with
the flabby movement with which great misery
alters the firmest, sweetest lips.
In that little room down the passage a hard
blow had fallen on her, and she sank trembling
into a chair and held her hands to her eyes.
Dream-buds, so tenderly, so carefully loved and
nurtured, had been shrivelled to death in a bitter
wind. Fair-winged hopes were dashed to the
ground, their wings broken, and all flying stopped
for ever. In a word, she had been told she could
never be a mother.
And at home —that fair home of hers —was the
husband, who had often dreamed away to her long-
iupfly °f the little fair-faced child with shining
hair, and eyes of the purest blue who was to walk
beside him some day, and whisper to him tender
child-things with her hand in his.
“ It must be a little girl.”
How often he had said it !
“A little girl, because she will be like you.”
And they had even talked about her name—this
little being whose coming had never been heralded.
The mother called her Star-Baby; the father, little
Annie, for that was the mother’s name, and there
was none better.
And, had there been anyone to listen, he would
have thought their child was already with them, a
real, living little one. Their lips were always
lingering round its name. . . . “I must bring the
little one something in my pocket to-night.” . . .
“ We must never let little Annie pull the cat’s
whiskers, as these children are doing.” . . . “I
should like to buy baby a doll’s perambulator,
like that little girl’s.”
And sometimes the mother would go on tiptoe
to the bedside, and bend down and whisper, “ She
is fast asleep.” And the father, not to be outdone
in this fond, foolish, primeval tenderness, would
say, “I think I hear her calling ‘Daddy,’” and
he would come back presently and say, “ The little
girl was frightened of the dark.”
Father ! Mother ! Never, never could it be.
Her heart sickened at the thought of her hus-
band. To her a grief, a sadness that would
shadow all her life. To him it would be an
anguish that would turn all his future into dead-
sea fruit.
He was a man born to be a father. Every
child loved him and came slowly, hesitatingly as
children will, but always surely, to his side. Ho
had the indescribable art of making conversation
with children. He talked to them as if they were
as old as he, and that is what wins the little
hearts.
They had been married now two years, and for
one the world had held no one but themselves—
he for her only, she for God in him. It was in
the second year she learned of his longing for a
httle life he would love to join to theirs.
Then all the latent motherhood in her sprang to
flame, and burnt with a bright, ever-deepening
glow that sent a warmth over heart and brain,
and changed the.whole aspect of life. Self began
to dwindle, dwindle. The rush of love flowed
over everything that had life—her plants and
flowers, and birds and dogs;—the mystery of
their birth awoke strange thrills in her heart,
and their helplessness brought the wonderful
hud of maternity into fuller, lovelier bloom. Out
of love sprang love, and all the waifs and strays of
the world were touched with this tide of mother
tenderness. She could hardly believe it was she,
herself, who felt so. She had never known that
she would care for children. Every woman loves
to hold a baby and kiss the helpless hands and
feet, and that was all the extent of her love for
children until now.
And now it was all over.
* * * *
“ I saw a tiny thing to-day just like little
Annie,” he was saying.
They were sitting alone on their verandah that
looked over a rose-garden towards the sea. Dusk
was falling, and here and there the light of a
coasting steamer gleamed far out on the Pacific.
Dkl you, dear ? ” she forced herself to answer.
A week, and she had not told him. A subtle
change had come over the brightness of her face ;
depths of her eyes lurked weariness.
( l Her father was a working man.”
You were glad of that; you were able to give
her one of your endless pennies.”
“ You’re a witch. I own I never see these
little things without wanting to give them some-
thing, and she was so tiny, and had just her fair
curls.
For they had often looked, in dreams, on the
face of their little one ; they knew every line and
curve, every light and shade of the little features.
He came and flung himself at her side, and
leaned his head against her knee. He reached up
for her hand, and brought it to lay on his head.
“Big Annie,” he whispered.
“Yes,” she whispered back to him, and tried to
keep the pain out of her voice.
“Do you know what I was thinking? . . . Hove
you—truest, dearest woman—l love you. ... You
seem to me to be more and more beautiful every
day. . . . But sometimes, girl, sometimes we are
a little lonely. . . . We are not enough for each
other. I look forward and see a time when we
might—might care for each other a little less, and
then a little less. . . . But the time will never
come. . . . That is why I want the little one so
much. Did I hurt you?”
“ A little. . . . You might tire of me—might
love me less.”
“Never, never. It is impossible. But it must
be born in me to love a child, and I am stunted
until then. Then I shall love you doubly, trebly,
a hundred thousand times more dearly.”
“But they say,” she murmured—and this was
the poor little one straw she had been clinging to
so desperately the whole week past—“ they say
that a childless man and woman love each other
more dearly than those who are fathers and
mothers. Their love retains its early freshness—
is a truer comradeship. They are all in all to
each other, for there is no one to divide their
hearts with.”
“ That may be true of some, not of us—not of
you, not of me. She will - be the great, enduring,
eternal bond, the only bond that can never
weaken.”
Like a child himself, he whispered against her
knee that he longed so for the little arms to be
round his neck, for the little cheek to be against
his ; that he yearned to carry her about from room
to room in his arms, to buy her dollies, and
little baby toys. . . .
She thought her heart would break.
* * * *
To the old pain, the week-old pain, that
seemed to have begun whole centuries before, there
was now a new one added. He could contemplate
the time when he might tire of her.
Next, the pain would come when he had tired of
her.
V Tired of her ” was an ugly phrase. It was not
quite what he meant. She knew he was hers in
some stronger bond than charm or beauty.
But the atmosphere of his love would soon be
too still and silent for him ; the beauty of it would
jar when the longing for the little arm was strong
on him. Then he would look at her critically,
coldly, and wonder why her presence there no
longer filled the rooms with radiance and a sense
of rest.
Day by day she lost her brightness, her quick
capacity for laughter and warm responsiveness.
Thought ' grew leaden with turning round and
round in the one small place. There were cruel
moments when her secret bit her like the Spartan’s
fox, but she smiled and forced herself to play her
part—-the part that must inevitably be disclosed
some day as hollow.
She forced herself to wander with him through
all his tender imaginings; she made herself respond
to every scheme for the little one’s happiness.
“When she. is old enough we will take her to
Italy, to Paris. How old ought she to be?”
“We will take her when she is eight.”
Life altered again. A new revolution, and she
saw that for herself she could bow to this blow,
and some day even kiss the hand that dealt it.
Her eyes had been opened, and selfishness, which
is blindness, never could return. The mother-love
that had been given to her so lavishly need never
be wasted while the world stretched out around
her, hungering everywhere for love.
But her husband had gathered the little one in
his arms so often that he almost believed she was
there, blue-eved and sunny-haired, with a mouth
like a clover for sweetness. To know that such a
child was never to be born to them would be more
bitter than to have Death take her from his arms.
Down she went to the brink of the grave, p’ay-
ing the part gaily, tenderly all the while. Won-
dering with him how soon the good God would let
them know of little Annie’s coming, whispering to
his whisper that the cling of the little arms was
the sweetest thing in all the world.
And only on the grave’s brink, with Death
staring like a hungry wolf into her face, and her
heart too torn and wounded almost to resist, she
told him.
“There can never be any little Annie.”
And she told him she had known it many
months. Told him the knowledge, and the
thought of the chasm that was to divide their
lives, had been slowly killing her. Everything she
laid bare to him, all her pitiful little mockeries,
her tender, sad deceits.
Then she was ready to turn away and die. But
the hungry wolf had seen the agony on the man’s
face, and fled, knowing its time was not yet.
There, at her side, was the child for whom her
mother-love might flow, this broken-hearted man,
her husband !

East London, Cape Colony, So. Africa,
July 11, 1896.
‘‘Shortly after leaving Johannesburg, where we had resided several
years, I contracted a fever, which left me in a very weak state. I was a
long time without any improvement, and none of the various remedies I
tried, under the doctor’s direction, did me any good. My husband finally
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, which cured several acquaintances
of oms who had suffered from impoverished blood and general debility. I
theiefore began to take the Sarsaparilla, and its good influence was soon
apparent. Within less than a month I was as well as ever, and could eat
and sleep like a child. Gratefully yours,
Tjt,y Forbes
Mr. Henry lorbes writes in confirmation of his wife’s testimony, and
adds that he had suffered from dyspepsia and loss of appetite, and that he
was cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

Beecham’s Music Books are lithographed from well-engraved plates on stout paper,
and edited by an eminent professor of music, thus guaranteeing perfect accuracy. Each
volume contains thirty different pieces of Music, either old gems, or some of the most
popular songs of the day, some of which being published at 25., have been included at
considerable cost. The Songs have all the original Syphonies and Pianoforte accompani-
ments in full. During the year 1896 no less than ONE MILLION of these books were

called for was published in Volume 7 so far back as 1894.
Volume 11 and the preceding 10 Volumes can be obtained from most newsagents and booksellers in
Australia at TWOPENCE per Volume.
