MALTHOID is displacing ': old-fashioned

Nevinson on Freedom
So much journalese masquerades as Litera-
ture, gilt-edged and solemnly bound, that
one is glad to have preserved in covers a
little of the literature which often appears
in newspapers. A writer like H. W. Nevin-
aon, whose Essays in Freedom (Duckworth)
have been gathered from the Nation and
other journals, brings wide knowledge and
a literary instinct to the treatment of a great
variety of subjects, and the results are worth
more than the moment’s notice by the news-
paper reader. In the first place the subjects
are generally of permanent interest. It
would be difficult for the most gifted writer
to make enduring articles out of Wade or
Willie Kelly, for the subjects are ephemeral.
They may, however, have a chance of being
“immortalised in a footnote ” by some his-
torian, or of being embalmed in the amber of
the satirist. The difference between these
essays and ordinary journalism resides mainly
in the fact that they were written, not
because the subjects had to be treated, but
because the author felt strongly impelled to
write about them. Nevinson is not by any
means a “ literary person,” fastidious about
form. In his essay on “ The Crowd Profane ”
he refers to a number of great writers who have
powerfully influenced the crowd, and says
that there appears to be in all of them “a
certain genial carelessness, a vehement exu-
berance, a regardlessness of criticism, an
impetuosity that is often outrageous.” He
thinks the merely literary man is in danger
of losing touch with life ; the dirty world
offends him and drives him into retire-
ment to write for “ the elect.” The imme-
diate influence of such writers is therefore
negligible.
If you wish nowadays to drive a poignant insult
into anyone’s heart, call him “a literary man.”....
Many years ago Mr. Balfour was engaged in a
political controversy with an opponent whom he
could not confute by any argument. “I knew
Mr. So-and-so as a writer of verse,” he said, and
no further argument was needod. The whole
British nation felt at once that an opponent who
wrote verse could not be considered seriously.
When Mr. Oscar Browning was standing for
Brixton and had just been defeated, a woman in
the crowd put her head into his carriage window,
and after accusing him of every natural and un-
natural crime, flung at him the final taunt of
“Poet!” Her mistake was uncultured, but her
triumph oyer the vanquished complete.
Keen interest in the world and its ways
he found in George, Meredith when an old
man, and a freshness about his books as of
to-day. Whereas Swinburne suffered the
penalty of aloofness ; being, in the latter
part of his life, one who pursued heauty in
far-off scenes and times and became deaf and
blind to present things.
There have been two test questions for lovers of
liberty in our day and country—the misgovern-
ment of Ireland and the extinction of the South
African Republics. That the poet of “Songs
before Sunrise,” and the pleader for the Man-
chester Fenians of 1867, should have been blind
and deaf to the struggle for freedom when it lay
close before his feet and was not yet/illumined by
distant time or the glamor of great names and
picturesque adventures, is a more direct sign of
some flaw in his art and method than all the
laughter and absurdity and tragedy into which
the “ aesthetic movement ” sank at last.
All that Nevinson urges in favor of purpose
in literature has been better said by Bernard
O’Dowd in that fiery pamphlet, Poetry Mili-
tant; but in a gossipy article on favorite
books he very sensibly puts the case of those
who, like himself, love literature but fear its
paralysing fascinations :
If they mix largely with action and with interests
not concerned with literature at all, they will find
their craving and their power of enjoyment only-
increased. Yet, perhaps, that is really the best
thing they can do. A'ction gives a penetrating
insight into the value of words, and, after all, it is
better to be wildly drunk with thought or beauty
at rare intervals than to go fuddling oneself day
and night in the tap-room of a library. So if ever
I had a holiday, and felt the craving for literature,
I should try to get hold of a book that would keep
me alert with new spiritual adventures and intoxi-
cated with new perceptions as with new wine.
A large number of these essays are con-
cerned with literature, from the dramas of
iEschylus and the poetry of Milton down to
Elizabeth Robins’ play, “Votes for Women.”
It is always, however, the literary expression
of the spirit of Freedom which has attracted
him ; for his knowledge of life has taught
him to fill what is often an empty word with
immense significance.
I can form no vivid conception of Freedom
apart from what I have seen. To me the word
conveys nothing as a Natural Right, nothing as
an abstract idea, and nothing as a syfnbolic
woman with wings blowing a trumpet into the ears
of marble captives, decoratively asleep in chains.
I have learnt the reality of the thing only from
the misery of its opposite.
The essays are uneven, as most collected
essays are. Some similes are frequently
repeated—like the upas tree in Coleridge.
But on the whole the quality is line, and the
book is worth reading and keeping.
Hewlett on the Free Life
The slight sketch of Sen house, the Gentle-
man Gipsy, which Hewlett gave in Hcilfvxty
Souse made one wish for more. In that
story Senhouse did not moralise very much
—he only outlined his philosophy and came
in effectively at the end to carry off the girl
whose adventures filled the major portion of
the book. Open Country (Lockley Library)
describes Senhouse at an earlier period when
he lived the Simple Life in its most austere
form, and met Sanchia, an English incarna-
tion of the chaste Huntress, Artemis—the
divinity to whom Hewlett has already devoted
a volume of poems. Here Senhouse explains
how he, the son of a wealthy colliery pro-
prietor, came to live a free life, close to
Nature like Thoreau and a vagrant like
Borrow. But here he moralises too much
and loses the girl.
After wandering in Europe, earning his
own living as he went, he returned to Eng-
land, where he made as much as ss. a week
by his paintings, and found it sufficient for
his wants. It was while painting one day
that he first had sight of Sanchia, then at
the innocent and impressionable age of 20.
She, unaware of his presence, had ventured
barelegged into a pool to rid it of duckweed.
When he came forward to offer help, her
complete unconsciousness of the dazzling
legs proved her of the company of Artemis.
“ The artist in our friend admii'ed, and the
man was stirred. He dated his subjection
from that moment.”
Sanchia is unusually innocent for her age
and position ; but that may be given in.
She is captivated by the Gipsy, not physi-
cally—as lie discovers—but intellectually.
He instructs her in first principles, nourishes
her love of beauty in Nature and art, and
opens vistas befoi'e her budding mind.
When she goes away lie writes her letters,
tremendous in length 1 and weighty with the
philosophy of “Poverty, Temperance and
Simplicity.” “Chuck everything,” lie, says,
in effect, “especially property and the 39
Articles, live on vegetables and water,
and sleep under the sky—if you want
to be free.” His principal business was to
sow flowering plants all over England.
“England a garden and Englishmen the
gardeners,” he exclaims in one letter. “ I’ll
die for that war-shout. Isn’t it finer than
your all red map, Kipling, Henley and Co. ? ”
The letters take up a large part of the book,
and are virtually a treatise on the free life.
You may, as Hewlett says, skip them with-
out impairing the story. And the story is
a good one, the members of Sanchia’s family
are particularly well drawn and the style is
Hewlett’s best Meredithian. But the con-
clusion, which justifies the sub-title, “a
comedy with a sting,” is dependent upon the
letters. So if you want the full value of the
story you must also read Hewlett on first
principles. And it is worth reading,
W
Ethel Turner’s latest —Fugitives from For-
tune (Sydney Book Club)—also touches
the “Driven back to Eden” theme,
in a pleasant fashion. But here the
man who fled with his family from his
millions in America and leads the simple life
at a place called Byrock (29 miles from
Sydney, N.S.W.) finds the system break
dowxi. He would insist on all his children
wearing plain white garments, and never
allowed from the, inborn hankering of the
daughters for lace petticoats and colored
things. A young barrister helps to demolish
the old man’s notions, and all ends happily
in a return to civilisation.
A Struggle for Freedom
W. G. Spence’s solid volume, Australia’s
Awakening (Worker office), does not purport
to be a history of the Labor movement in
Australia, but “ Thirty Years in the Life of
an Australian Agitator.” Nevertheless, it
is a very full account of the beginnings of
the Trades Union organisation, the entrance
of Labor into politics, and the history of
the Labor party in each of these States up to
the present time : together with a statement
of the influence of the Labor party upon legis-
lation and its aims for the future. Spence’s
30 years as an agitator happen to be syn-
chronous with the growth of the present
powerful Labor organisations from a very
modest origin. He acted as midwife to the
Movement, looked after the infant, and now
blissfully contemplates its sturdy propor-
tions. His first-hand knowledge gives him
authority to speak about it, and if his
literary gifts are not great he has the
virtues of sincerity, clearness and accuracy.
Wherever we have tested his statements
we have found them correct, and his book
will prove of great value for many years to
come as a work of reference. There is no
other book of the kind. itoydhouse and
Taperell published a useful little book on
The Labor Party in N.S. W. not long after
that party came into political existence ; and
Victor Clark, the Commissioner from Wash-
ington D.C., wrote a criticism of The Labor
Movement in Australasia, which tried to
be impartial, and succeeded in being dull.
Spence’s book covers the whole ground,
so far as the Commonwealth is concerned.
The story of the difficulties in the way of a
union organiser, the heroism of the rank
and file (especially in the country), and the
lies and subterfuges of the capitalists, make
interesting reading. It is the record of a long
series of battles which have been won by
Labor, even when, at the moment, Labor
seemed to lose. Mixed with the story is a
good deal of propaganda matter and fatherly
advice to young agitators. , Spence knows
the wisdom of the soft answer that turneth
away prosecution, knows that guile is often
more successful than force ; and even if you
have right on your side a good bluff has a
better chance of winning.
Of course, Australia's Atvakening is an ex-
parto statement of Labor’s case. It does not
say what Labor in Politics has omitted to do
which it might have done, nor what things
have been done which ought not to have
been done. There is no attempt to meet
the criticism of the State Labor parties by
this paper, summarised in a leader on “The
Queensland Election and Some Side Issues ”
(14/10/’O9). But for what there is we are
thankful. Spence, the Nestor of Australian
Labor politicians, has given great pains to
the compilation of a much-needed history,
and long after Australia is wide awake it will
remember him gratefully.
The Sonnets of Douglas
Everybody knows, by repute, Lord Alfred
Bruce Douglas ; if they do not, then it is not
his fault. His voice is very loud now in
England, and, assisted by Crankey Crosland,
he is reminding the intellectual and aristo-
cratic folk of things no gentleman would
dare make them recall. His organ, The
Academy, has one excellent principle (and a
number of others badly carried out), and it
is a careful consideration of modern verse.
To show that he is not all blatherskite,
Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas has published
another small book of sonnets, and a book of
beautiful sonnets it is. Anticipating silence
on the part of the papers, and. crude notices
by ignorant reviewers, Lord Alfred Bruce
Douglas bade his henchman, T. W. H. Cros-
land, write a note at the back of the book,
where the said henchman remarks “that
several of these sonnets are as fine as the
best in the language.” As a matter of
fact, the sonnets are not great with
emotional fire or with deep thought, but
are written with a delicate and beauti-
ful facility. The second sonnet in the book
(To Olive) appears to us to be a sort of para-
phrase of Shakespeare’s Sonnet XXX
(“ When to the sessions of sweet silent
thought ”). The preordination idea of the
third sonnet to Olive (who is, as you all
know, Mrs. Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas),
beginning “Long, long ago you lived in
Italy,” is a rather worn-out idea. Henley
used it in his book of “ Echoes ” (“ I was a
king in Babylon, and you were a Christian
slave ”) ; and Stephen Phillips makes Paolo
say, in the fourth act of “Paolo and Fran-
cesca,” “ Did I not sing to you in Babylon ?”
There are 19 sonnets iu the book, and five
of them have an octave rhyme in “ess” ;
four of the five use “distress”; three use
“dress,” and two “press”; and in one of
them milord endeavors to satisfy our ear
by rhyming an affix “less” with another
affix “less.” This is just pointed out to
show that, though his lordship may cavil at
other people’s technique, he is not techni-
cally perfect himself. The following is the
best sonnet in the book,:
THE GREEN RIVER.
I know a green grass path that leaves the field,
And, like a running river, winds along
Into a leafy wood where is no throng
Of birds at noon-day, and no soft throats yield
Their music to the moon. The place is sealed,
An unclaimed sovereignty of voiceless song,
And all the unravished silences belong
To some sweet singer lost or unrevealed.
So is my soul become a silent place.
Oh, may I wake from this uneasy night
To find a voice of music manifold.
Let it be shape of sorrow with wan face,
Or Love that swoons on sleep, or else delight
That is as wide-eyed as a marigold.
Wallace Irwin’s Letters of a Japanese
Schoolboy (Dymock’s) are amusing enough
for an idle hour ; but they read better when
they appeared separately in Collier’s Weekly.
If you have not met Hashimuru Togo before,
it is worth while getting the book and read-
ing a little of him at a time. Too much of
this kind of thing palls :
Hello, thank you ! Give me to telephone 3C04
Spiritland, please ! Yes, sir! Hello —it—is Hon.
Win. Shakespeare residing there to talk ? Thank
you again ! Is them you, Mr. Shakespeare? One
question to reply for Japanese boy, please. Who
wrote them trajick of Julius Caesar? Hon. Ber-
nard Shaw?—No? — He improve it, you say ? Oh,
them ain’t no news ! Hon. Shaw know that
already.
Anstey’s Baboo Jabberjee, 8.A., suffered
from the same complaint.
—
Douglas Sladen, with his usual energy, follows
hot foot upon the track of Caine’s White Prophet
with a novel called The Tragedy of the Pyramids,
intended as a defence of the British army in
Egypt. If Caine needed a counterblast, Sladen is
the man for him. The Manxman has the satis-
faction of knowing that he is fighting with an
equal.
As an author, Theodore Martin died long ago,
and had been decently forgotten when the news
of his death came. Born 1816, his best work was
in the Bon Gaultier Ballads, written in conjunction
with Aytoun, and some fair translations of Horace,
Schiller, etc. He also wrote ads. for Pears’ Soap,
and a Biography of Albert the Goodie-Goodie.
Dead, also—G. Manville Fenn, an undistin-
guished writer of books which are given to kids at
Christmas, but which are never bought by boys
themselves.
WHAT THE DEVIL SAID.
It was the night time, God the Father Good.
Weary of praises, on a sudden stood
Up from His throne and leaned upon the sky,
For He had heard a sound, a little cry, -I
Thin as a whisper climbing up the steep.
And so He looked to where the Earth asleep
Rocked with the Moon, He saw the whirling sea
Swing round the world with surgent energy,
Tangling the Moonlight in its netted foam,
And nearer where the white and fretted dome
Of the ice-capped Pole spun back a larded ray
To whistling stars, bright as a wizard’s day.
But these He passed with eyes intently wide,
Till closer still the mountains He espied
Squatting tremendous on the broad-back’d Earth ;
Each nursing twenty rivers at a birth.
And then minutely sought He, for the cry
Had climbed the slant of space so hugely high.
He found it in a ditch outside a town,
A tattered, hungry woman crouching down
By a dead babe—so there was nought to do,
For what is done is done, and back He drew
Sad to His heaven of ivory and gold ;
And as He sat, all suddenly there rolled,
From where the woman wept upon the sod,
Satan’s deep voice, “O, thou unhappy God !”
James Stephens (in the Nation).

WHY BE BALDP
An Invitation to You to Prove the Efficacy of Harlene Free of Cost
UNIVERSAL HARLENE HAIR DRILL.
" Harlene Hair-Drill " is now the vogue.
“ Harlene Hair-Drill ” is not a mysterious
process. It is a scientific method of treat*
ing the scalp. It is, of course, the un-
healthy scalp that causes the hair to fall
out or become weak, dry, or brittle.
The scalp requires loosening, so that the
blood may circulate treely and generously
feed the roots of the hair and distribute
health. Why should men be bald and
women lose that rich blessing which is
their birthright—their beautiful, profuse
hair?
Messrs. Edwards, the proprietors of the
famous “ Harlene,’’ which has lor so many
years done a great deal to check the alarm-
ing increase of baldness, and to check hair
troubles generally, desire to spare no ex-
pense to convince the public that Edwards'
“ Harlene-for-the-Hair ” can do what they
claim for it; with this object in view they
are distributing a free outfit sufficient for
one week’s trial.
The outfit comprises:—
(1) An instruction hook that fully de-
scribes the nature of the hair and the cause
of hair troubles. It is illustrated and will be
found not only interesting, but instructive.
It fully explains the “ Harlene Hair-Drill,”
and the instructions are simple and concise.
(2) A Trial Bottle ot Harlene. This trial
bottle contains sufficient Harlene for the
scalp and hair to carry out the week’s hair
drill with thoroughness.
Iteinember this is a free trial. The outfit
will be sent on receipt of the coupon below.
Three penny stamps must be euclosed for
postage, although, if the package is called
for, there will ho no charge whatever.
Further supplies of Harlene may be
obtained from all chemists at Is., 2s. 6d.,
and 4s. fid. per bottle, or will be sent on receipt
of J ’ostal Order; which must i neludecarriage)
from the offices of Edwards’ Harlene Com-
pany, 9b-9fi, High liolboru, Eoudou,
England.
To Messrs. EDWARDS’ HARLENE Co.,
95 & 96, High Holborn, London, England.
Sirs,—l desire to try your otter of one
week's “ liariene Hair-Drill,” and accept
your free trial offer of instruction and supply
of “ Harlene.'’

No Home Should

Mr. J. BLACKMORE, the well=known Sydney unbeaten athlete
and pugilist, speaks of this splendid invigorating medicine thus
“ Gentlemen.—My opinion of your medicine, ‘Clements Tonic,’ as an invlgorator
for the nerves, for creating appetite and vital strength, is that it is unequalled. I
sneak from practical experience, for I have almost an unbeaten record, and several
times whilst training for my ring battles, most critical unless in the pink of con-
dition I have judiciously used it with gratifying results, it preserves stamina, In-
crease’s nerve-strength and confidence, and is Invaluable to all men, especially athletes.
I recommend it because I know Its health value, and of all medicines, at times necessary
to take, I regard It as the best for the nerves and blood.”
Witness—F, Fowler, J.P. (Signed) J. BLACKMORE.
All chemists and storekeepers sell Clements Tonic, price 2s. 3d. and 3s. 9d. per
bottle. It is invaluable for all workers, athletes, housewives and business men.
For the creating of rich, good blood, making the nerves as strong as steel,
keeping the stomach healthy, the appetite keen, athletes can rely upon it.
It never fails as a restorative agent of sound health.

James Connors, Pennant
Hills, N.S.W., aged 14, had
become very thin and pale,
and was troubled with a
severe cough
His mother writes (August
1908) that
“After taking SCOTT’S Emul-
sion for a short time he began
Steadily to improve. He looked
much brighter, his appetite
was better, and he had gained
about 7 pounds in weight, in
addition to which the cough
had almost gone. Now he is
quite well and strong, and in
better health than ever before.”
Tliis sort of recovery has
convinced multitudes of pa-
rents. of the superiority of
Emulsion
whose purity and strength pro-
vide a cure when everything
else and every other emulsion
prove insufficient. Every atom
of SCOTT’S digests and it
grows so upon the palate that
. young people come to regard
it not as a medicine but as
a treat.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Angel Jones’ Experience.
I was a man of influence on earth,
Respectable—aye, eminently so;
An enemy to all unseemly mirth.
And hoped, of course, to go where good men go.
Thus when I died I carried quite a swag
Of virtues, testimonials and “sich’'
Away with me ; but there ! I need not brag.
For I was known as pious, strict —and rich.
What then my terror (you will sympathise)
When, chucking down the lot at Peter’s door,
There lay before my horror-stricken eves
A little, quite-forgotten sin of yore.
It was what you might call an— er—romance ;
The foolish boy, the customary girl,
And—well, a lot of other things, perchance
A kiss, a vow, a letter and a curl.
You take my word, I felt a trifle bad !
But only for a moment; for the load
Of charitable deeds and thoughts I had
Would surely hide that painful episode.
And with a smirk of smug expectancy
I started to explain about my life,
My contributions to the local see,
My record, my relations and my wife.
But may I never ! if the grim old Saint
Did not stand by, and calmly sneered and
poohed,
“Are ye not satisfied?” And, “No, I ain’t!
He coolly said ; which I considered rude.
At last I flourished the certificate
Our bishop sent me (you remember it ?).
And do you think that pass improved my fate ?
Well, let me tell yo’u—not a tiny bit!
Fact, I was fairly beat, and wondering if
I had perhaps mistaken the address.
I glanced below, and caught the faintest whiff
Of beastly sulphur. Fancy my distress !
When suddenly the Saint began to grin,
And in a condescending sort of way
Stretched out his hand and lugged that wretched
■ sin
Into the glare of open, naked day.
All hope is lost. I groaned with trembling lip ;
And watching with the courage of despair
The Saint’s inspection of that luckless slip,
I noticed all at once a change of air.
A laugh rang forth, a portal swung ajar !
A blinding flood of golden light ahead !
A strain of song—and then a Voice afar
That spoke to me ; and this is what it said :
“I shall forgive your virtues, Pharisee,
Even that diocesan reference,
All for the sake that ONCK you worshipped Me,
Not in the letter, but the spirit’s sense ! ”
STEFAN VON KOTZE.
Emu Bay.
Early morning, and the shadows scarcely lifted
from the deep;
Purple veils of dark still linger on the misty trail
of night;
Silence on the dark-spread waters, earth that stirs
from drowsy sleep,
With the grey shapes of the headlands touched
with gleams of tender light,
Past the yellow curve of beaches and the hills that
face the dawn ;
And away,
Flushing cleft and cliff and gully, fairy glen and
sloping lawn.
Early morn of early summer on the blue of Emu
Biy.
Still more' vivid grows the glory in the pathway
of the east,
Splendid out across the waters shines the gre it
sun’s path of gold,
Deeper pink on flushing hills grown paler with
the light increased.
Pearl and amethyst turned crimson, set in shining
manifol d ;
And the dark rocks boldly standing where the
wavelets sighing low
Melt in spray.
’Tis but a storied picture from the Book of Long
Ago,
When the sweet November morning broke in gold
o’er Emu Bay.
See! the grey is swiftly deep’ning into dusk
across the waves;
The waters all are hushed and still, the beaches
growing dim ;
A pure splendor of white starlight all the blue of
Heaven laves,
And the hills have sunk to slumber with the late
bird’s ev’ning hymn.
Now, shyly do the lights begin to twinkle in the
town,
And the flowery scents of summer hang like in-
cense in the air,
And the day
Has died behind the blue hills on a cloud-draped
crimson bier,
And the silent night is dreaming on the dark of
Emu Bay.
I see the dark hills ’gainst the stars, the quiet,
heaving sea,
The white road in the gloaming leading downward
to the town,
The red light on the waters by the little hidden
quay,
The white massed garden blossoms and the hedges
low and brown.
All unseen upon the curving beach the soft waves
murmur low,
Aye and aye,
Oh ! I see this dusky picture from the Book of
Long Ago,
When the stars are backward gleaming from the
blue of Emu Bay.

THE N.S.W. RAILWAY SYSTEM AS AN
INCENTIVE TO SECESSION.
The block of traffic on the N.S.W. State railways
grows worse, if the language used by producers
and consignees is any criterion, and vague things
are said in all manner of quarters about “vigorous
measures.” The favorite remedy mentioned—in
fact, almost the only one mentioned either by the
Government or by the people who clamor exceed-
ingly on theGovernment’sdoor-mat—istheduplica-
tion of the railway lines between Sydney and New-
castle in the north, Sydney and Bathurst in the
west, and Sydney and Goulburn in the south.
These items will cost several millions, but it is
reckoned that the great scheme of dx-agging to
Sydney all the trade gathered by 3624 miles of
lailway from the face of 310,372 square miles
of country can’t be carried out otherwise.
And even the wildest applicant seems, in
a general way, to take it for granted
that all the trade of N.S.W. must go to Sydney or
else not go at all—that it would be uncanonical
and sacrilegious to send it to any other port, even
to any other N.S.W. port —so it would appear that
these costly duplications are inevitable. There
may be suspicions in certain quarters that they
are premature and nil at the traffic doesn’t really
call for them—or wouldn’t call for them if it was
worked on saner lines—but such ideas are mere
heterodoxy. Still there are countries which carry
far more tonnage per inhabitant with only a quarter
as much railway per inhabitant to carry it on,
and yet they have no congestion, no block, no huge
losses through sheep and cattle and wool and
wheat and other produce being left behind, and
they have no need to load themselves, yet awhile,
with a heavy debt for duplications. But these
countries make it a fixed rule to rush the goods for
export to the nearest port which is big enough to
take in the right size in ships. If there are five
good ports scattered along their coast they believe
in using them all—not in needlessly wearing out
their rails and their rolling stock, and burning
hundreds of thousands of tons of needless coai,
and paying gigantic sums in needless wages, and
charging huge sums in needless freight, to drag
all the trade to one town down in the south-east
corner of the State. This congestion policy causes
the last section of the l-ailway line to be so
crowded that it is necessary to spend millions on
duplications which the traffic shouldn’t really call
for till another 20 years are past, and in the mean-
time the congestion method leaves large masses of
goods behind to rot and perish. The people who
shove through on an average seven or eight times
the N.S.W. traffic per mile of line without
turning a hair don’t work in that fashion.
* * * *
If the N.S.W. Government ciiose to build about
20 miles of railway in the right spot it could end
practically the whole congestion trouble for many
years to come. All the pretence that it is a dis-
tracted Ministry doing its best in the face of a
very grave emergency is sheer hypocrisy. All its
professions of sympathy with the producer are
bogus and sham and fraudulent. Twenty miles
of railway, a few wharves and sheds, a customs
house on the beach, and an honest system of rail-
way rates would enable the export and import
trade of all the northern railway districts to be
dealt with at Port Stephens, a
splendid harbor a few miles north
of Newcastle; and straightway
one-third of the load which Sydney
has to carry would be gone. The
profit to the State would be very
large. It would pro-bably gain a
lot in freights, for the trade that
is now left behind by the wayside
because the congested lines can’t
carry it would be saved, and the
new faculties would create new
settlement and new business. The
State would avoid the waste of
large sums in coal, wages and wear
and tear by cutting many miles
off the average railway journey. It would
save the price of much new rolling-stock, for
two trains that don’t get blocked and delayed
by having to struggle over a final 100 miles of
in tensely-congested railway can do as much ser-
vice as three or four which have to perform that
feat. It would save, for quite a number of years,
the cost of many miles of duplication. Further,
N.S.W. would have a new city as an asset—it is a
fool of a country which deliberately throws away
cities—and, in consequence, it would have a
stupendous increase of land values for the State
to tax. But, so far from proposing to divert the
trade of the existing northern railways to Port
Stephens, the North Coast line, now under con-
struction, is made to take a detour in order to
avoid that large and useful harbor. It does this
so as to force the traffic of another 300-odd
miles of railway on to the hopelessly-over-
crowded track which leads to Sydney. The
new line follows the coast closely till it
gets near to Port Stephens, and then it does
a long and costly sweep inland in order to dodge
it. Certainly it touches the coast at Fermnount
and Coff’s Harbor, far north ; but then Fern-
mount and Coff’s Harbor are small places, only
fitted to take in the little coasting vessels that
discharge their cargoes at Sydney. Fernmount
and Coff’s Harbor are things that the Congested
Population party can’t object to ; but it is con-
sidered worth the spending of large sums of money
in order to avoid the big port where great oversea
steamers might load and unload. It is the sort
of fool’s trick which is calculated to make the
angels weep, and a Government which squanders
the public money on that kind of swindle is a
mere fraud and hypocrite when it declares that
it is animated by a sincere desire to help the
troubled producer.
* * * »
Again, a main line from Goulburn to Jervis
Bay, if built and managed with an honest inten-
tion of making Jervis Bay a great port, would
relieve the insane rush of traffic that comes upon
Sydney from the south and south-west. And
when the line to Bombala is finished it only needs
a few miles further extension to open up Two-
fold Bay and give further relief. These works
would end all questions about duplicating rail-
ways until the traffic had at least doubled;
they would wholly remove the congestion
which makes so much trouble; they would supply
N.S.W. with two new cities in addition to the
new city on Port Stephens; and they would save
hundreds of thousands of pounds in the cost of
needless railway haulage and maintenance and
sundries. Also they would enable thousands of
new settlers to get their produce to a profitable
market, whereas at present the few existing
outside settlers sometimes have to see their
produce rot because the railways can’t carry it to
Sydney, and at other times they have to pay the
value of about half their crops in order to get the
other half dragged over needless hundreds of miles
to the octopus city. The trouble is now affect-
ing the manufacturer as well as the settler.
Recently the cement works at Portland
(N.S.W.) had to discharge 20 men, though they
would much rather have engaged 20 extra men,
the fact being that the paralysed railway system
couldn’t get the product away, and there was no
profit in heaping up dead stock at the works.
The N.S.W. Government is now constructing,
oris about to construct, fully 540 miles of new
railway, all of which miles are to pour their traffic
into Sydney, often dragging it at great cost past
first-class harbors on the way, and thus make the
trouble worse. This sort of folly leads to curious
results and side issues. In the first place, as the
lines spread out and increase, it takes less and
less trade to make the same amount of congestion;
in other words, 40 small or half-loaded trains con-
verging from 40 branches on to one line can make
vastly more trouble than 20 large or fully-loaded
trains doing the same thing from 20 branches.
Distance counts for as much as weight, and when
it is remembered that the average distance that
each ton of hay, straw or chaff had to be hauled in
1883 was 77 miles and that in 1908 it was 187 miles
it i 3 plain that one ton can make more congestion
now than two could in 1883. Another result of the
construction of new lines in the coastal districts,
all pointing towards Sydney, is that they
block the traffic of the far-out country railways
and make these far-out railways unprofitable.
There are remote N.S.W. lines which were worth
building a dozen years ago, but which seem only
worth tearing up now ; and part at least of the
reason for this deterioration is that the block
between them and Sydney—the only port with
which they are allowed to trade —grows con-
stantly worse. Here is a two years’ record on a
few of the far-out railways of N.S.W. :

Tne two big Riverina lines—Narrandera-Hay and
Narrandera-Finley—with their joint loss of
£48,910, are shocking examples. Yet just along-
side them the little privately-owned Deniliquin-
Moama railway made a profit of £6021 (over 6 per
cent, on its cost), and part at least of the reason
for this difference is that the little private line
takes the shortest possible route to the nearest
port and thus makes business, while the State line
takes the longest and dearest route to a port 250
needless extra miles away and thu3 kills busi-
ness. There is really very little use in'building
lines in the remote parts of N.S.W. if their
chance of doing any good depends entirely on the
capacity of the single railway which runs through
the bottle-neck at the entrance to the Sydney
peninsula. Even the proposal to duplicate the
principal railways at great cost for some distance
north, west and south of Sydney won’t meet the
case. The traffic from the new lines now in hand
will probably eat up the extra accommoda-
tion. And even if the lines close to Sydney were
duplicated six times over, it would make no differ-
ence in the fact that Bombala is within 40 miles
of a first-class N.S.W. port with which it isn’t
allowed to communicate, and that it is proposed
to make it pay railway freight for 318 miles to
AUSTRALIAN RAILWAY BUILDING.
N.S.W. has a splendid deep water harbor at
Port Stephens which could accommodate all the
export and import trade of the northern half of
the State and thus relieve the congestion at Sydney
and on the railways around it. Port Stephens
has to be kept shut up in the interests of the con-
gestion policy, so the northern railways pass it a
few miles away , and the new North Coast line
takes a costly detour in order to avoid it.
Sydney, where the port is no better for its pur-
poses—to say nothing of tne fact that Sydney is
300 miles farther from Europe, where its wool and
wheat have to go. This sort of business pays
nobody. For the year ended June, 1000, the
N.S.W. railways earned less profit for every mile
run than they have done since 1904. And at the
same time the area under crop in N.S.W. in 1909
was 125,000 acres less than in 1900. The increas-
ing difficulty of reaching a market must be at least
partly responsible for this lamentable position of
things.
* * * *
The inevitable result of the N.S.W. Congestion
Policy is secession. There would probably have
been secession before this time but for the fact
that the person of British descent is slow and
patient, long-suffering and not easily moved to
wrath. Consider the situation of the southern
part of N.S.W. —say the area from Shoalhaven
to the junction of the Murrumbidgee and the
Murray, or from Shoalhaven to the S.A. border—
if it set up for itself. It has already got railway
connection with Sydney, so that port is secured to
it. By building about a dozen miles of cheap
railway from Finley to Tocumwal, and another
short cheap section from Finley to Deniliquin,
it could get the connections with Melbourne
which the N.S.W. Government denies it,
and thus have the run of a port and a great
market that are about 250 miles nearer to it than
Sydney is. It could join on to other Victorian
railways at Mildtira, Swan Hill and Koondrook,
and thus connect its farthest-western section
with the big adjacent city, whereas now that far-
western section has no connection with any city.
It is too remote to allow of any possibility of a
railway to Sydney that will pay expenses, and the
Government at Sydney won’t allow it to connect
with Victoria ; so, to all intents and purposes, it
might as well be in the middle of Sahara. These
suggested lines would also give the new State access
in half a dozen places to the Murray, from which
it is now almost entirely cut off, and thereby it
would have cheap river connection with South
Australia. On the east it could build a short line
to its own natural port at Twofold Bay, access to
which is rigorously prohibited by the Sydney
Government, and then it would have its own
outlet to America, Asia and Europe, and the big
liners would call in amid great enthusiasm and
depart with popular applause. And if a railway
were built to Twofold Bay the trade of eastern
Gippsland, which is now shut up and isolated and
dead, would also find an outlet there, to the great
profit of the new State. The State would ha.ve
its own bank (the Bank of Riverina), its own in-
surance companies and its own trustee companies.
Wagga, its capital, would have 100,000 people
instead of the 5000 or so that it boasts at present.
These are some of the things that might be if
commerce were allowed to take its natural course,
yet they don’t nearly exhaust the list. But
N.S.W. is run to a great extent on the lines which
burst up the Spanish Empire in olden days. Spain
insisted that its colonies should trade only with
Spain, and that their ships should unload only at
Cadiz. Sydney insists that the outlying parts of
its great territory shall trade only with Sydney,
and that their railway trucks shall be unloaded
exclusively at Darling Harbor. The principle is
the same, and if the principle isn’t altered the
result will almost certainly be the same.
THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY
AND THE PROPOSED EASTERN DE-
VIATION.
The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill drags
slowly through the legislative halls of Parliament.
As it drags, the clamor of the State representa-
tives, each demanding that the transcontinental
line shall go, if possible, through his bit of ground,
grows more virulent, and the member for Aus-
tralia—the one who tries to think for the whole
continent—is conspicuous by his absence as per
usual. The habit of dividing the business of the
country into water-tight compartments leads to
everything being done on small parish principles.
In the matter of the Federal capital, there are the
five States which don’t really care because the
capital can’t be in their territory. In the case of
the Port Darwin railway there are the two
States—Tasmania and Westralia —which don’t
care a straw because the line won’t go
through their territory, and the other State —
Victoria —which doesn’t care much, because,
even if the line is diverted into the eastern
States and joins on to the Victorian system at
Swan Hill or some such place, there will be no
money spent on new railway-building within its
borders. In the affair of the equally urgent and
equally important line to Perth, there are the
four States —Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria and
Tasmania—which can’t see that it matters much,
because the work lies outside their State jurisdic-
tion. This watertight compartment policy doesn’t
make for large ideas, and yet a community with
such a large country as Australia might almost as
well have no ideas at all if it hasn’t large ones.
* * • *
Even an enlightened selfishness should make
the remotest States take a deep interest in
the Territory question. The offer now before
Parliament is that the whole Territory shall be
handed over to the Commonwealth at the mere
price of its debt, that a railway shall be con-
structed through the centre of it, that the S.
Australian railroad from Port Augusta northward
shall be sold to the Commonwealth, and that the
Commonwealth shall have its own southern sea-
outlet at Port Augusta. In other words, it is
proposed that there shall be, right across the con- i
tinent, a uniform-gauge railway, fit to carry express
traffic, and that every inch of it shall be the com-
mon property of Westralia, S. Australia, Tas- 1
mania, Victoria, N.S.W. and Queensland. The
port at the north is to be the common property of
these States; likewise the port at the south. The
line is to open up and make profitable 523,620
square miles of country which will be the common
property of these States —that is to say, that Tas-
mania’s interest in it on a population basis will
represent an area almost as large as Tasmania,
itself. The profits of the land and the rail-
way will belong to the six States, and even if-'
the average Tasmanian or Victorian never sees,
his great asset the asset will be there all the same.
It is absolutely necessary, in order to connect thes
Territory with the more settled parts of Austra-
lia, to carry a railroad through one State or
another, but so long as the least possible extent of
the line lies outside the Federal area, and it is
Federal property all the way, and there is a
Federal port at each end, and the profits are all
Federal property, the best has been done to con-
serve the interests of the six Federal partners.
• • * *
The eastern deviation idea is the direct con-
trary of all this. The line will be vastly longer
and consequently more expensive ; even to carry
it from Port Darwin to Rockhampton, away up in
Central Queensland, means covering more mileage
as the crow flies than the whole distance across
the continent from Port Darwin to Port Augusta.
And to connect with Brisbane, Sydney and Mel-
bourne the distances will be very much greater.
The deviation will leave most of the Territory—
which is to be the common property of Westralia, ,
S.A., Tasmania, Victoria, N.S.W. and Queens-
land-undeveloped to the general loss, and
yet the bill which the States must meet for
railway-building will be much larger. Instead of
the least possible extent of the line running
through State territory the largest possible extent
of it will run through State territory—and very
dry State territory at that. In fact, it will be
essentially a State line, yet the States —Queens-
land and N.S.W. —which propose that the biggest
part of the line should be diverted through their
country don’t offer to pay for the extra and need-
less mileage within their borders. Nor do they
offer to sell any of their State lines to the Common-
wealth and give it a port, as S.A. does, so that the*
line and the profits may be Federal property from i
sea to sea. Apparently the idea is that the'
Federal line shall end in the wilderness of no-
where in particular, and the State lines shall filb
in the rest of the communication—in other words,,
that the Federal line shall be a mere feeder of the-
State lines. Nothing is said about any provision
for a uniform gauge from sea to sea ; in fact, as
the Commonwealth won’t own the deviated line
from sea to sea it is difficult to imagine how pro-
vision can be made for a uniform gauge.
• * * *
The proposed deviation through the eastern
States will bring Sydney no nearer to Port
Darwin than the straight line ; the differ-
ence will be that by the deviation N.S.W.
will only have to build, at its own expense,
about 120 miles of iron road from Bourke to the.
Queensland border, whereas to connect with the.-
straight Port Darwin-Port Augusta line it will
have to build about 340 miles at its own cost
via Broken Hill. The eastern deviation will
bring Melbourne no closer to Port Darwin than
would the straight track; its advantage will
be that the eastern route will directly connect
Broken Hill and western N.S.W. in general with
Melbourne, and bring some of their trade there.
The eastern deviation will bring Tasmania no
nearer to Port Darwin than the straight line ;
the difference will be that the Hobart person,
who wants to try his fortune in the Territory
will go, in one case, by Melbourne and Adelaide,
and in the other he will go at greater length by-


Melbourne and Broken Hill. And the eastern
deviation will make both Adelaide and Perth
more remote from the Territory than by the
straight cheap road.
* * * *
The advocates of the eastern deviation all say,
for very shame’s sake, that “South Australia
must be treated liberally.” S.A. took over the
administration of the Territory when ic was aban-
doned by N.S.W. and Queensland and was in
danger of becoming a nigger-infested appanage of
India or some such place. The principal con-
dition which the British Government imposed as
the price of the definite cession of the Territory to
Australia was the building of a railway from
Adelaide to the northern coast. The most profit-
less section of that compulsory line —the one
through the desert—is already built, and if the
Commonwealth proposes to take over the northern
province and construct a new and wholly different
line through a larger and more remarkable desert
further east, it is admitted that it must offer S.A.
some compensation for the work already done.
Therefore, if one takes the case as it affects Tas-
mania—that being a State which neither trans-
continental railway will traverse, and which can,
therefore, take an unbiassed view of the case—
this is how the Island will be affected if the
eastern deviation is adopted :
(1) It will be brought no nearer to the Territory ; in
fact, it may find itself rather further away.
(2) It will have to pay more as its share of the cost of
the new railway, for the line will be longer and more ex-
pensive.
(3) It will have to pay its share towards the proposed
“liberal treatment” of S.A. for the abandonment of the
partly finished line to Oodnadatta.
(4) It will have an interest in the port at one end of the
line only instead of in the port at each end.
(5) Instead of having an interest in a Federal line
which runs from sea to sea, it will only have an interest in
a Federal line which starts from the sea and ends in a dry
wilderness. The rest of the track and the profits will be
State property'.
(6) Instead of the Territory, of which about one-twenty-
second part will belong to Tasmania, being opened up by
the railway through its whole length, so as to turn it into
a paying asset for Tasmania’s profit, the eastern devia-
tion will cut across a corner of it, and spend the rest of
its energy in opening up the eastern States—partly at
Tasmania’s expense.
That is how the eastern deviation will affect Tas-
mania. Its effect on Westralia and S.A. will be
worse. Its effect on Victoria will be just the
same, barring the one compensating fact that it
may bring a certain amount of the Broken Hill
trade to Melbourne. Its effect on N.S.W.
won’t be widely different. In fact, when
the mileage is carefully measured it is difficult to
see that the proposed eastern deviation will
profit anybody outside Queensland. And if the
deviation happens to be connected with the port
at the mouth of the Macarthur River, in the
eastern part of the Territory and on the western
side of the Gulf of Carpentaria, it might be rather
a dreadful surprise to Queensland than a benefit.
For in that case it would probably take the trade
of Cloncurry and Longreaeh to the Macarthur,
and leave Queensland with nothing for its pains
but a fairly large element of astonishment and a
stomach filled with the east wind.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Capital with an Alleged Rainfall of
47 Inches.
The struggle to fix the Australian capital at Yass-
berra, where it will be within the business radius
of the Sydney morning papers, is naturally an
effort which has a lot of influence behind it. It
not only has the influence of the Sydney morning
papers behind it, but it has also the influence of
all those N.S.W. politicians who feel that their
political existence depends to a great extent on
the support and approval of the Sydney morn-
ing papers. And as most of the politician g
from the other States ceased to take any
very active interest - in the matter when
Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, S.A., the
Northern Territory and Westralia were all
disqualified as possible sites for the capital, the
matter was mostly left, so far as any real fighting
went, to those N.S.W. politicians who feared to
offend the Sydney morning papers; though one or
two outsiders departed from the usual habit of
indifference and took sides in one cause or another.
About the most remarkable of these is Senator
Russell of S.A., whose frenzy for Canberra has
led him into some remarkable statements. The
following, which appeared last Thursday in a
Sydney daily paper, is a fair sample :
Senator W. Russell (S.A.) championed the claims of
Yass-Canberrn. He had visited the district on several
occasions, and was still of opinion that it was the right
place for the Federal capital. The rainfall in the catch-
ment area of the Cotter River averaged 38 inches—in 1906
47 inches were recorded. He wished to do his duty con-
scientiously, and would vote for the Bill; but, first of all,
he desired to make a certainty that the water supply was
adequate. He had seen the Cotter River, and it seemed
to be about as wide as the Torrens. The lowest rainfall
was 24.5 inches.
It seems natural to inquire where Senator
Russell got these figures. He doesn’t appear to
have explained. There are four meteorological
stations close around the Canberra capital site
and around the Cotter River, and the rainfalls of
these four places are recorded in the N.S.W.
“Statistical Register.” They are Cooma, Quean-
beyan, Yass and Lake George. In the “ Statisti-
cal Register” for 1907 (the latest issue) the
following figures are given ;
Lowest year’s Highest year’s
Rainfall in Rainfall in
inches. inches.
Cooma .... 13 16
Lake George 19 29
Queanbeyan .. 11 25
Yass 13 28
Also the Federal Government Meteorologist re-
ports that the average rainfall of the Canberra
district is 23in. Therefore it is natural that one
should ask Senator Russell, of S.A., where he
found his average of 38in. rainfall on Cotter Creek,
and where he discovered the alleged 47in. rainfall
of 1906. No such figures appear in the N.S.W.
official statistics. They don’t appeal: in any
official statistics. They are flatly contradicted by
all the published statistics. There is no ex-
planation as to where the so-called figures were
published, as to who invented them, or as to why
they weren’t invented earlier ; and no one seems
to explain what person named Smith or Biuggs
measured the alleged downpour, and whether he
did it with a kerosene tin or a flower-pot. Yass-
berra, in fact, seems to be wrapped in mystery all
round. It is a place where some strange hole-
and-corner business is always happening, and
where amazing rainfalls and water supplies that
can’t be discovered in any official records are
always taking place, and where big rivers that
aren’t marked on any map or mentioned in
Statistician Knibbs’ huge list of rivers are always
being discovered. It is a pity that this curiously
furtive Federal capital doesn’t come out from its
cavern and declare itself more openly.
The Patent Law.
The Foreign-trader’s alarm lest anything should
be manufactured here really amounts to a disease.
It has been proposed that Australia should fall in
line with Britain and most other civilised lands
by enacting that no patent shall hold good in this
country unless the holder arranges, within a
reasonable time, to manufacture the patented
article here, or allows some one else to manu-
facture it on reasonable terms. The multipli-
cation of patents renders some such law abso-
lutely necessary. A patentee is a monopolist. If
a man invents a thing which is so far and away
the best of its kind that a country must use it or
be industrially left behind, he becomes a person
of great power. For instance, if he produced a
new cotton-spinning device which reduced ex-
penses one-half, and patented it in every country,
and then sold his rights for a fabulous sum to
(say) the German Government, and the new holder
was allowed to supply or refuse to supply the
new machinery at pleasure—well, by refusing, it
could transfer all the British and French and
U.S. cotton industry to Germany, and shut up
Lancashire, and make Manchester a waste.
Obviously, to recognise patent rights to that
extent would be absurd, but that sort of thing
was already happening on a small scale ; hence
the new British law, which has already led to the
establishment of a swarm of fresh industries in
the Bull country. But Senator Pulsford and
the S. M. Herald have both implored Australia
not to follow suit. The possibility of Australia
getting some new industries seems to strike them
both as a shocking thing. They say we have so
small a population that in many cases it wouldn’t
pay to make the patented article here, though they
quite fail to mention what valuable article it is of
which so little is used that a population of about
4J millions can’t support even one workshop, or
what article it is that is manufactured on such an
enormous scale that unless at least 5,000,000
people are supplied from one workshop the
place will be run at a loss. A great
yearning to know the name of that article fills
this paper’s soul, but it doesn’t really believe that
there is any such article ; on the appearance of
things the only trouble with old Pulsford and
the aged Herald is their terror lest Australia
shall make things for itself, and thereby damage
their god, the importer. Pulsford’s other great
argument is that if Australia adopts the proposed
patent law, all the other British colonies may
follow suit, and when St. Helena, St. Lucia and
Malta, for instance, insist on every patentee
putting up a local factory the position will be
absurd and ridiculous. But on the same basis it
is strictly logical to point out that it was an insane
proceeding for Pulsford’s State to build 3400
miles of railway, for all the British colonies might
follow suit, and to put 3400 miles of railway on to
the Falkland Isles would lead to the engine fall-
ing into the sea. And the folly of having any
such paper as the S. M. Herald becomes
plain to the meanest intelligence, for every
British colony might do likewise, and the
Rock of Gibraltar (two square miles) couldn’t
possibly provide advertisements and circulation
for another S. M. Herald: In fact, it seems that
Australia should have left almost everything
undone that it has done, lest every other British
dependency should insist on doing the same, for
there is hardly one of our institutions that would
fit, say, Labuan (30 square miles). Labuan
divided into six federated States, with six capitals,
and a Senate, and adult suffrage, and a Rabbit
Act, and six land laws, and Local Govern-
ment, and a Barren Jack reservoir, and a Han-
sard, would be a spectacle for the dogs. Why
didn’t Pulsford realise the danger earlier ? Even
now they may be introducing Queensland’s Prickly
Pear law in Beluchistan, and trying to lay 400
miles of waterpipe amid the swamps of the,&iger
in imitation of the Kalgoorlie water scheme, and
if these things happen all is indeed lost.
A Curse from the Stock Exchange.
This attempt to drag everything into Sydney is
having its inevitable result—not only a block or
dead-lock on the railways, but a growing curse at
the system of State ownership and control. “In
proportion to size of territory, production, trade
and wealth,” says a Sydney Stock Exchange
circular, “ there is probably no other fully
civilised country so backward as N. S. Wales.
That our railways are unequal to the
needs and requirements of the country is
due entirely to our system of State railway
monopoly.” As a matter of fact, N. S. Wales is
one of the most heavily-railwayed countries in the
world ; moreover, the proportion of railway to
population has increased enormously during the
last few years. In 1880 there was one mile of
railway to every 881 people; at the end of last
year there was one mile to every 456. France even
now has only one mile to every 1587, Germany
one to every 1721, and Great Britain one to every
1912. Spain, Russia, Italy, Japan, India and other
countries have much less railway accommodation
—Japan has only one mile to every 9910 people.
Also, in proportion to area, N. S. Wales is heavily
railwayed. Canada has one mile of line to every
168 sq. miles of territory ; Russia one to every
212 ; but N. S. Wales has one to every 89. These
are comparisons that can be made definitely. But
“production,” “trade” and “ wealth ” are matters
largely of guesswork ; and the common plan of
lumping exports and imports and calling it
“trade” is ridiculous. Still, even on these
“ trade” figures, N. S. Wales has one mile of rail-
way for every £22,700 of “ trade,” while
Great Britain has only one for every £46,450. It
is one thing, however, to be heavily railwayed
and another to be well railwayed. If N. S.
Wales had compelled the big lazy landlord
to make room for the small energetic settler it
wouldn’t have seen its expensive railways run-
ning for hundreds of miles through country from
which it gets no traffic except a few bales of wool;
and if the crowd which has been responsible for
this lunacy hadn’t also struggled to drag every-
thing to or through Sydney, the country
wouldn’t have seen millions wasted in rail-
ways that crawl unnecessary hundreds of miles
to the bloated city instead of making a bee-line for
the nearest outport. So N. S. Wales isn’t as well
supplied with railways as it ought to be, in spite
of the fact that already every 456 people have to
carry the interest-burden of one mile of line,
while in Great Britain that much weight has
only to be borne by 1912 people. But in-
stead of cursing “our system of State
railway monopoly” for the shortcomings, the
Antl-Sosh crowd ought to heave all its curses
at itself for having stood in the way of a progres-
sive land-tax, and for having been the head and
tail and most of the middle of the gang whose
object in life has been to further bloat an already
over-bloated city.
.Vfc
Certain Laborites and. Their Contempt for
the People.
The Yassberra Federal capital site struggles
along in the Senate by small majorities; last
week it just escaped being thrown into the scrap-
heap by two votes. It is expected to do better in
the Reps.—in fact, its passage there is supposed
to be easily assured. After that—well, after that,
it will still be competent for the country to reject
the whole political swindle at the general election
and to send the gang of political swindlers who
engineered the job back into oblivion ; but un-
fortunately, in the absence of a referendum,
it is difficult for the country to clearly express
its views. The Yassberra business has been,
from first to last, a high-handed attempt
to prevent the people having any effective voice
in their own affairs. The original selection of a
capital was made in 1904. The people had a
chance to announce their approval or disapproval,
so far as anything can be definitely announced at
a general election, in 1906, and apparently they
approved—at least they showed no definite sign
to the contrary. Yassberra wasn’t even men-
tioned to the people then; in fact the place
wasn’t invented in those days. Then after a
long series of intrigues the Congested Population
Party came temporarily on top, and the new site,
about which the people had never been consulted,
got a small major.ty. Straightway there was a
frenzied hurry to get it fixed beyond recall —if such
a thing were possible—before the people could
have a say. The fact that the Tory crowd was in
that movement is nothing, for the Tory can never
quite realise that the people should have a say in
anything; but the fact that certain Labor men,
who profess to believe in the self-governing
rights of the people and in the referen-
dum and so forth, did their utmost also to
deprive the people of any effective voice
in one of the greatest questions which can ever
come before the Federal Parliament was an act of
common, sordid, disgraceful backyard treachery
which should be remembered against them to the
last day of their lives. The most utterly shame-
less of these apostates was W. M. Hughes, who
openly clamored for a hasty settlement lest the
people should have an opportunity to condemn the
whole wretched job— Hughes, who said that
“the special circumstances which made for the
selection of Yass-Uanberra might never occur
again ” (in other words, that the electors, if they
weren’t muzzled, might never let these circum-
stances occur again), and demanded that the
business should be rushed through without wait-
ing for a referendum or an election or any
other expression of the popular will. Other
Labor members who have a tine old Tory con-
tempt, when it suits them, for the referendum
and the popular will are J. C. Watson and
Senator Russell of S.A.; and there are
a few more whose names will probably
appear when the division is taken in the
House of Reps. Every democratic elector
should make a note of these members who have
turned dog in such a brazen fashion on the first
principle of democracy, and should write that note
large and nail it up conspicuously. Men of
that kind are not the sort that any democrat
should vote for. They are unsafe. The next
time they are struck by the complete
unimportance of the people they may curtail
the franchise suddenly between elections, or
abolish the White Australia policy, or some trifle
of that sort. In a sense, the people are wholly, at
the mercy of their members. At any ordinary
general election these times colored immigration
is no more mentioned than Yassberra was in
1906, for the White Australia policy is regarded
as a thing which hardly needs mentioning now.
Yet it would only require a few people like
Hughes, Russell and J. C. Watson to turn their
coats, and there might be 100,000 Chinese or
Hindus in Australia before another election gave
the people a chance to say things. In that case
also the matter might be hurried on because, to
paraphrase the words of W. M. Hughes, “the
special circumstances which made for colored
immigration might not occur again.”
The Bank Clerk.
The N.S. W. Clerks’ Union has been saying things
—and saying them none too soon—about the
wretchedly-paid bank clerk, an individual who
has probably' a worse outlook than any other
equally well-dressed and shiny-hatted person in
the Commonwealth. His life, as a general thing,
is genteel poverty before he marries and genteel
starvation after he marries. Among the rank
and file of the banking profession an average rise
of 100 per cent, wouldn’t be too much to meet the
case. Certainly a large proportion of banks, as
matters stand at present, can't afford to pay
double the present salaries; but it is mainly’
waste, muddle and incompetence which create
the impossibility. The bank clerk is the victim
partly of greed and partly of insane competi-
tion. In quite small, ordinary towns, where
the business could support two well-paid
bank managers, two well-paid staffs of clerks
and the rent of two offices, there are four
office rents to pay, four ill-paid managers,
and four hungry and wretched staffs. The story
of the A. J.S. Bank might be cited as a case in
point. In its roaring days its great ambition was
apparently to run level with the far bigger and
more solid Commercial of Sydney. The Com-
mercial spread pretty recklessly in those
times, and whenever it went to a new town-
ship the A.J.S. was apt to do likewise.
What were called “ banking facilities ” sim-
ply rained on the small towns 20 years ago.
The clerks in the less fortunate and more bubbly
institutions had to be ill-paid, for the business
wouldn’t stand good salaries; though even if it
could have stood good salaries the clerks would
almost certainly have been ill-paid just the same.
The shareholders didn’t make very much real
profit even with all the poor payment. These
were the days when a mouldering little town like
Mittagonghad three banks, and Penrith had three,
and other places.were likewise, and when almost ipiy
kind of business was taken because the superfluous
institutions had to do something to justify their
existence. When the smash came branch banks
were closed wholesale, officials were discharged in
droves, and salaries were cut still lower to make
up for past losses. The bank clerk’s luck has
been out in good times and in bad. So wretched
is his pay that rigid restrictions are made to pre-
vent him marrying and helping along the birth-
rate till he has reached an almost impossible
salary, because, if he married at a reasonable
age, the burden of a wife and family would drive
him to embezzlement. No parson, preaching
about “Race Suicide,” has, to The Bulletin’s
knowledge, alluded to this aspect of the case ; yet
the evil is so gigantic that in one big head office
there are said to be only three clerks who are
qualified by their salaries to marry. When a
large bank runs its affairs on an average salary list
of £217 per annum for each office—head office and
branches all included —the fair inference is l that
not more than one in 50 of its officials can possibly
get a wage at which even a highly economical
form of matrimony is possible. For all this
misery there is only one possible remedy
—to materially increase salaries on plain
Wages Board principles and let the manage-
ments adjust themselves to the new conditions.
It is no more impossible in their case than in that
of the manufacturers who also assured the world at
large, when Wages Boards were first invented,
that the results would be blank ruin. In fact,
that remark about blank ruin may be taken as read
in all such cases.
♦
The Possible Exodus of Holman.
“ Henry Horsecollar ” speaks:—
State-member Holman, of N.S.W., has broadly inti-
mated that if the Labor party carries the principle of
compulsory education much further he will leave his old
political associates for good and all. At present this
country has compulsory grammar and history and
geography, and even to some extent compulsory gym-
nastics and physical training. Now it is proposed to
compulsorily teach shooting and military drill, and
Holman reckons that if this education business doesn’t
stop it is time for a pale, serious lawyer to quit. After
all, it might not be a bad thing for the party if he did
quit. Speaking seriously, it is difficult to imagine
any progressive party that wouldn’t be the better
for losing Holman. He is hopelessly Conservative
and unprogressive, though he mistakes himself
for an advanced Liberal. He is crowded with old
book-learning taken out of the text-books of his
student days—crowded so full that he hasn’t room
for a new idea. Holman is badly afflicted with the
English superstition—the old Podsnap variety of English.
He is firmly convinced that Freetrade is the right thing
because it is English, and that no Englishman would
stand “food-taxes.” It is no use to turn up last year’s
official records, and show that the Englishman does stand
food-taxes, for Holman has read in the old books that
Freetrade is the absolute opposite of food-taxation. He
is convinced, because he has read it in the literature of
Podsnap, that comp jlsorv military training leads to war,
that it (combined with Protection) has loaded “conti-
nental nations” with imposts from which happy England is
exempt, and that it is a ruinous proceeding which takes
the people away from productive work. And it isn’t the
least use to show Holman that Britain has more wars
than any other European State; that it is, per head, with
one possible exception, the most heavily-taxed country
in Europe; that it charges the community more
per head under its tariff alone than the Unitedi
States, and more than any other European coun-
try, barring perhaps France; that it has almost the
biggest military and naval expenditure bill in all the
world, and that its voluntary military and naval system
keeps more men permanently away from reproductive
work than the universal military education method of
most of the despised and contemned Continental nations.
These are the facts of to-day, and are not to be found in
the old, unchangeable Freetrade text-books. Holman
never seems to realise that the world keeps moving, and
that the ideas which seemed to be immovably based on the
circumstances of 1870 may be hopelessly burst on the evi-
dence of the circumstances of 1909. He wrote once, I
observed, to The Bulletin to point out that the stupend-
ous emigration from Germany proved that Protection was
disastrous in its effects. Of course, German emigra-
tion has almost wholly ceased under Protection,
but Holman was back 40 years or so among the
figures of Germany’s dead old Freetrade past. He
didn’t know that things had changed; he didn’t
know that they could change. In Australian politics he
seemingly doesn’t know that a new Power has arisen in
the Pacific, and that our old safe isolation is gone. He
doesn’t know that with the rise of Germany the old safe
reliance on Britain isn’t what it was. He hardly knows
yet that Federation has happened. He is a State-Frighter
of the narrowest sect of the Pharisees—the old Cabbage
Tree Mob of the ’6o’s and ’7o’s—the people who believed
that N.S. W. was all Australia, and that Sydney was all
N.S. VV. He is not an Australian, and never will be one ;
he is not a New South Waler : he is merely a Sydneyite
and mostly a cityite—his political sympathies, though he
probably doesn’t know it, hardly extend as far as Botany.
A youngish, very-old man, with an ill-fitting varnish of
new Democracy, is William Holman—brilliant and alert,
but narrow to an almost incredible degree except where
the L„< ty programme compels him to widen out, in theory
at all events. And now he thinks of leaving the
Labor party because he believes he sees in it a
leaning towards compulsory military education. He is
doubtless aware that the right to call out the adult male
population in time of great national danger is regarded
as the absolute prerogative of every Government, but he
holds that if the Australian has to go out he should, in
the blessed name of Liberty, go out untrained and un-
armed like a sheep to the slaughter, for that theory is to
be found in some of the venerable tomes that Holman has
in his head. A look at the outer world and at the circum-
stances of the hour might tend to create a doubt upon
the accuracy of this view, but Holmax either never looks
at the outer world or looks at it with an eye which sees*
nothing.

When night is on the deep
The Light throws out its arm
To shield the crews that sleep
And keep them from all harm ;
But all the ships pass by
The empty harbor mouth
To prosper ports that lie
To Northward and to South.
The children of the Light
That like bright Knowledge beams,
Watch ever from the height
The ships that pass like dreams
For ever past the Bay,
And wonder where they go.
(The cities far away
The children do not know.)
The brilliant, wheeling Light,
The dark and idle Bay,
The lone, surf-haunted night,.
The long and careless day,
This is the children’s life
Above the restless sea,
While cities in hot strife
Blot out their destiny.
The empty harbor waits
Before the thriving lands ;
While by its open gates
Commerce with greedy hands
Between the rivals steers
The riches that by right
•Should build a city’s piers
Below the lonely Light.
But there no city rears
Its towers unto the skies;
There Desolation stares
With wild and vacant eyes;
No temples, schools or marts
Are seen. ’Tis but a rude
Prison for brains and hearts,
That surf-bound solitude.
The white arm of the Light
Flies seaward to the Ships,
And sweeps the heaving night
For Knowledge—but it slips
For ever out of reach.
Now answer! Cannot we
Learn from —if we can’t teach —
These children by the sea ?

In pursuance of the Closer Settlement policy of
the N.S.W. Government, another estate has been mopped
up ; this time the Ooreen and Back Paddock portions of
the Gunatnbil Estate, in the Corowa district, about 18 to
40 miles from the town of the same name. It has been
divided into 63 farms, of an average area of 615 acres,
worth, roughly, £2456, in a district well suited to growing
wheat, oats, vines and fruit trees. All portions of the
estate are well within the radius of the Murray River irri-
gation scheme. The terms are 5 per cent, deposit on the
capital value (which includes the improvements), and the
balance payable by yearly instalments of 5 per cent., in-
cluding principal and interest at 4 per gent. The rainfall
is about 18 inches ; 23 of the 63 farms already contain
tanks, and all are fairly free from rabbits.*
There is no finer cigar than that made of the
tobacco grown in the Philippine Islands. He who has
not enjoyed the flavor of a good Manila cheroot has not
yet learned to live. He has merely existed. But when
one remembers that Manila cigars are made by nearly
naked women in factories which are not under the super-
vision of any Government inspectors to ensure cleanliness,
it is apt to spoil the enjoyment of the Manila. The States
Tobacco Co., an Australian concern which has its fac-
tories in Australia, has determined that the white Aus-
tralian shall have a good Manila eig'ar that is beyond all
reproach, made by a clean Australian in a clean,
wholesome Australian factory, "under the juris-
diction of clean Australian factory legislation. So
the superintendent of the co. hied him away to
Manila, and spent much time hovering around the
factories where the reeking Filipino makes the smokes
of the connoisseurs. He went, he saw, he noted, and en-
gaged four of the best Filipino cigar-makers to aid in
instructing the Australian workers how to make the
various shapes peculiar to the real Manila. Then he came
back, bringing with him, not only the four cigar-makers,
but 100,0001 b. of Manila leaf from the famous Isabella
district, which corresponds to the Old Belt in Virginia.
This is easily the largest purchase of cigar leaf ever made
on Australian account. So henceforth the Australian who
wants to smoke Manila cigars made in Australia should be
careful to inquire for “ The Gem of the East,” and then
he will know he has got the best Manila in the world.*

The “ Two Party System ” Again Disgraces
Itself.
A courLE of smashing' arguments against the out-
of-date two-party form of government materialised
last week ; and they were voiced, oddly enough,
by the identical Sydney papers which laud this
bit of political foolishness most enthusiastically.
Seven weeks ago a general election occurred in
Tasmania. Elliott Lewis formed a Fused Ad-
ministration, and a cry went up in Tory circles
that, henceforth, everything in the Apple Garden
was going to be lovely owing to “ the establish-
ment of a rational two-party system on the Eng-
lish model.” Then Ewing seceshed from the
Lewis party, and Jack? Evans and others found
themselves in disagreement with its financial pro-
posals, and as an immediate result the Lewis
Ministry burst with a loud report, and in the
pained words of S. M. Herald (20/10/’O9) :
It may be, now, that Tasmania will have to go through
another general election before she reaches solid ground
again.
The Herald in deploring this happening unlooses
a lot of froth about the “ party disloyalty” which
brought about so disgraceful a state of things.
However, what the Herald terms “party dis-
loyalty” may be described with equal, not to say
mor#, justice as “adherence to principle.” If
Evans and the rest disapprove of Lewis’s
finance, what law of ethics counsels them to be
liars and say they approve of it? Neither in
Tasmania or any other civilised part of
the world, these days, is it possible to
get together a dozen thinking men who
agree on all political subjects. To take a case in
point, the Freetrade anti-Socialist is liable to
be a convinced anti-Defenceite. The Cabinet
wherein he earns his comfortable remuneration is
impelled by the force of public opinion to go back
on its previously expressed views as to the advan-
tage of retaining the volunteer system and intro-
duce a Universal Military Training Bill. The
Freetrade anti-Socialist is straightway faced with
the alternatives of either being a liar and turning
what he has been wont to call “militarist,” or
being honest at the cost of smashing up the
Ministry, throwing his party out of office, putting
the country to the expense of a general election,
losing his own salary, maddening his party news-
papers, and generally playing Hades with the
established order of events. All this uproar
bitterness, dishonesty and needless expenditure
of cash might be averted by the adoption of the
Elective Ministry arrangement, and that is the
only way, under present conditions, that these
undesirable things are going to be averted. Yet
another aspect of the two-party idiocy was pre-
sented by the Sydney Telegraph (21/10/’O9) in a
leader entitled “Abusing the Public Patience.”
The article had reference to the notorious difficulty
private M’s.P. have with their Bills ; and the
urgent matters on which' private members are
so often driven, in desperation, to attempt to
legislate. Thus ingenuously, in the above regard,
did the Telegraph give the two-party show
away:—
Many of these so-called private Bills affect large public
interests. Before certain works can be started it may be
necessary to get an Act passed, but the prospect of doing
so is so dispiriting that men who would embark in enter-
prises employing labor and developing the country often
turn away, and so great opportunities are unused.
Matters of very grave importance, as affecting the social
life of the community, are also frequently the subject of
attempted legislation by private members, but failure
awaits them from the same cause. The Government of
the day is hampered by the necessity of keeping its party
always solid, which only permits it to deal with a limited
number of questions, so that certain Bills, which a
majority of the House, IP IT COULD GET AT THEM
FREE PROM PARTY ENTANGLEMENTS, might be
willing to pass, can never be passed unless taken up by
.private members.
Here is a frank admission that one of the effects
•of the vaunted two-party system is to prevent the
public from getting the sole thing, that it pays its
representatives to give it—namely beneficial laws.
It is a confession that Ministries under the exist-
ing arrangement provide the country not with
the measures the country needs, but only with
the ones that are not calculated to imperil the
existence of the party. In short, the in-
terests of the nation go by the board
that the party may flourish, and that those
holding Ministerial jobs in it may draw their
screws with regularity and despatch. If Aus-
tralia’s only aim in enduring the expense of two
Federal Houses and 12 State ones is to provide
jobs for a horde of temporising opportunists who,
eight times out of ten, are only game to do the
things, legislatively speaking, which don’t matter,
ic will continue in the old ruck. But if it wants

frenzy of disapprobation or approval, as the case
may be—that is to say, the sort that are best
worth while—it will adopt the Elective Ministry

The Vic. Railways Standing Committee has re-
ported officially on the much-discussed railway
across the Western plains; and recommends that
a line, 100 miles long, be built from Maroona (on
the Ararat-Hamilton line, just against Ararat) to
Gheringhap (close to Geelong). This line, for fully
90 miles, will go through nothing but big stations,
the holdings of the western sheep kings, almost
the whole of which are fit for closer settlement.
Here and there a few blocks have been sold to
farmers, who are growing wheat; but the bulk of
the land is still as God made it, or almost so.
Wherever this line passes, and for at least 10
miles on either side of it, the land will get an
added value of from £1 10s. to £3 per acre. So,
in fear and trembling, the standing committee re-
commends its construction :
Conditionally on those whose land will be enhanced in
value by the construction of the railway handing over to
the Government, free of charge, the land required for
railway purposes. . . .
Also—
Conditionally that, in the event of the railway . . . not
earning an annual revenue of £23,000 during a period of
20 years from the date of the opening of the line, those
whose laud will be enhanced in value . . . shall be rated
on the acreage basis. .. so as to make good any deficiency
in the £23,000.
It is a fairly cheap proposition for the big land-
lord. The hundred miles of railway is estimated
to cost £418,270. If it adds, on an average, £2
per acre to the value of the land for three miles
on each side of it—and it will probably add that
value for 10 miles instead of three—it will make
the landlord a present, at the country’s expense,
of £772,000. And he is requested to promise that
if the line doesn’t earn £460,000 in the first 20
years he will make up the difference. The differ-
ence will probably be nil, or Bd., or somethin#
like that; but even if it is the whole £400,000, the
landlord will still be £312,000 in pocket. In fact,
he will be a lot more than that in pocket, for the
£772,000 will happen now, and the payment of the
Bd. or £460,000 or whatever it is, will be spread
over 20 years, O yes, the landlord is all right!

Newcastle is decked out these days with placards
announcing that the Sydney morning papers will
shortly begin to arrive earlier than they used to.
For a long time the Sydney morning papers have
been of opinion that the Railway Commissioners
should provide a very early train to Newcastle—
even one so early that, if the Sydney papers went
by it, they would arrive in time to cut into the
circulation of the local morning paper in the coal
city. Now it is always difficult for a Commis-
sioner to kick long and hard against the city press
in a supremely centralised State like N.S.W.—
especially a Commissioner who has had the worst
kind of luck with his McMylek hoist, and who is
in great trouble because of the block on his rail-
ways. These things are calculated to give him
the tired feeling. Certainly the very early
train hasn’t been forthcoming, but there is
to be an earlier one than of old. And
probably the very early train will come later on,
for it is the business of the State railways to
bring everything to Sydney and to supply the
country with everything from Sydney. So, when
there is a prosperous paper anywhere within 100
or 200 miles of Sydney, it becomes the obvious
duty of the Railway Department to start a train
so early at the public expense, and run it so
furiously at the public cost, that the Sydney
dailies may get to the scene of action in time to
compete on level terms against that local paper.
For the existence of any prosperous local paper
within easy reach of Sydney is a sin against the
doctrine of centralisation, and if the Railway
Commissioner doesn’t recognise that fact, he has
obviously failed to grasp the true inwardness of
the centralisation policy, and ought to have the
thing explained to him.
As The Bulletin goes to press comes the glad
news that that eternal litigant, Premier and
Attorney-General Wade, has fallen in again.
One Giddy put in 30 years’ service in the N.S.W.
railways. When he retired he was supposed to
be entitled in the usual way to a month’s pay for
each year of service. But on some obscure tech-
nical point he was offered instead a month’s pay
for each of the first. 20 years of his service
(£454 in all), and in place of the £l4O due on
account of the remaining years the Ministry insult-
ingly offered him 7d. Now the Full Court has
decided that the Wade Government’s law is bad
once more, and judgment has been given against
it for the entire amount. It looks a shockingly
mean and petty-minddd case such as only a shock-
ingly mean and small-souled Government would
be capable of.

If the Tory crowd in Victoria doesn’t stop crying
over the “ poor farmer,” his crops will rot before
long. It is Murray’s proposed land-tax that has
started the downpour. The poor farmer is going
to be ruined. Of course, there is an exemption,
so that the poor farmer will either have to pay
nothingat all orelse very little; but Mr. Employers’
Federation Blackwood told the Treasurer the
other day that the financial institution which
holds the mortgage will tell the poor farmer to
pay up; so the poor farmer will be hurt
even though the tax may not touch him
directly. This point is liable to cause the
poor farmer some concern. But he really
needn’t worry. If the private Cohen won’t
keep his mortgage going, the public Cohen
will. And, moreover, if the overlooked State
Land Bank takes over the mortgage it will prob-
ably charge him less interest. So the poor farmer
can go on eating his pumpkin pie in peace. With
the State Land Bank waiting for customers in the
background, the “financial institutions” are not
at all likely to empty him out, and if they did
they would very likely be doing him a good turn.

“The Bells,” the hallowed old drama
made famous by dead Henry Irving, as revived
at Sydney Palace suffers somewhat bv the scratch
scenery provided by the management ; but, as the
play has only a matinee lien on the stage, an ela-
borate setting is perhaps out of the question.
E. Hoggan-Armadale, a well-seasoned and robust
English actor, grapples with the part of Mathias,
which, according to the programme, he has played
for 800 or 8000 nights in Great Britain. As the
impoverished young Mathias, the overseas player
is at a disadvantage by reason of his years—for he
is something over 21. The 10 years’ interval
which elapses between Act 1 and the pro-
logue wherein he murders the travelling Jew,
brings him to the haunted, grev-haired stage,
and as the haggard Mathias who hears
the jingling of ghostly sleigh-bells and dreams of
vengeance until he goes mad, E. Hoggan-
Armadale does his heavy scoring with a generous
old-school hand. But he is more effective in the
occasional quiet passages; one or two of his
minor-key speeches—more particularly that to his
prospective son-in-law—are excellently rendered.
Miss Nellie Fergnsson is more successful as Mar-
garet the young wife than as Margaret the
matron ; Kenneth Hunter makes a satisfactory
Christian and bears his uniform and testimonials
bravely; Reginald Goode, as M. Bussey, the
young but villainous landlord who would turn his
tenants out in the snow, is more Goode than
Bussey ; his unlawful suggestions to Margaret are
voiced in the gentlest tones, and he flinches as he
utters them. When he is ordered out by the over-
heated Mathias he goes gladly, with a half-hearted
show of baffled fury. This player is plainly an
incurable hero. The Father Herman of J. P.
O'Neill raises the question: What proportion of
the population of Alsace-Lorraine is of Irish
descent? At times this scribe trembled lest he
should invite poor, haunted Mathias to join him
in a jig or to help him sing “The Wearin’ of the
Green.’’ Mr. O’Neill has a cheerful habit of
almost singing his lines, and what in another
would be merely a plain invitation to have a
drink with him becomes a loud aria with trills in
the middle of it. Most of the other parts are
fairly done, and on the whole it has to be
admitted that the old story is moderately well
presented.

Sydney Palace will get its divorce from
the Wrong Man after the performance on Friday
night, October 29. On Saturday evening the
public will be invited to shed tears over “ East
Lynne” at popular prices. The woman who
feels inclined for an emotional bolt, or who has
grief to spare, need not weep alone if she can
contain herself until Saturday, October 30. And
after that there are five more nights when Woe
will prevail, and the damp handkerchief of Sor-
row and Bereavement be welcomed at the box-
office.

Of all the modern English dramas “A
Village Priest ” breathes most of the remorseless
spirit of ancient Greek tragedy. The Wheel of
Fate is shown in all its inexorableness, and the
Sin that started with an almost imperceptible
homicide goes rolling amok down the years, and
spreading as it rolls and cursing at large as it
spreads. As the abbe says, “The thing goes on.”
It goes till it even crashes up against the awful
impervious respectability of the stodgy widow
D’Arcay. There it stops ; even Fate is shattered
“THE BELLE OF NEW YORK ” AT
SYDNEY HER MAJESTY’S.
Four humorists — Nable, Percy, Lissant and Leslie.
against the invincible complacency of the
fat old lady who stands behind her barri-
cade of platitude and defies, quite uncon-
sciously, God, Man, Devil and Circumstance.
“ The Priest ” is always an intellectual treat, but
with Titheradge in the name part and Cyril
Mackay as Armand D’Arcay, it is a snack for the
immortals. The show is materially helped out by
Miss Griniston and Miss Murray as the Comtesse
and Marguerite de Tremeillan, respectively. As
Jeanne, the convict’s daughter, Ethel Warwick
has not much chance, but her last moan as the
curtain comes down and her father goes back to
prison to save the feelings of a stolid old lady is a
fine effort. Miss Murray has a profile which,
when backed with hair done in Grecian style, is
going to do a lot of damage in this world, and her
acting is in keeping with her profile. Miss Grim-
ston’s efforts to make herself appear somewhat old
and somewhat withered are the weakest part of her
performance. Writer lastsaw “The Priest” played
with Brough as Jean Torquenie and Joseph Carne
as the abbe. Titheradge makes the abbe much
more shabby—he is almost squalid as compared
with the impersonation of Carne. But he has an
excuse. The Church in France has struck a
mountain of trouble and lost much revenue since
the days of Carne; wherefore the abbe’s clothes
are naturally somewhat more rusty and his head-
gear faded. But there is a simplicity about
Titheradge’s character that was. not in that of
Carne —a simplicity that well becomes this kindly
old man, who is an honorable gentleman first
and a priest afterwards. Whereas Carne made
him a man of much reserve strength, Titheradge
makes him a tottering ancient, strong only in his
determination to do the right thing. “How will
the dear old thing live?” anguished a young
matron at Sydney Royal on Saturday, when Tith.
announced the fact that he had left the Church.
Nobody was worried about the future of Carne’s
abbe. He was quite able to take care of himself.
Miss Temple’s rendering of Madame D’Arcay is
hard to comment on. If she tries to make the"old
lady the incarnation of Stodge, her purpose is
fully attained.
** * *
On Saturday there will be a new drama at
the Royal—“ The Cheat,” for the first time in
Australia. It probably has some reference to the
miserably short odds which Moss Palestine is
offering on the stiff horse for the Cup. So
Diogenes of this paper will take his lantern and
go out in search of a dishonest man, and find him
without any difficulty.

The “Belle of New York” still rings
vigorously at Her Majesty’s (Sydney). All other
bells—including the dinner-bell, the cow-bell, the
church-bell, and the bell which starts Johnson’s
train—have long since taken a back seat. They
are things of no account, and there is nothing in
them, though if they were turned upside down
they might be useful to hold beer. It is difficult
to say exactly what it is that has made
this musical comedy so much more dur-
able than other plays of its kind and
day and generation—plays which started with
equally bright hopes, and are now lying dead by
“THE BELLS” AT SYDNEY PALACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The prologue shows the Inn on Christmas Eve ;
Outside a paper storm of torn MS.
Is raging. One could easily believe
Some godlike editor was in distress.
Of course, ’tis but the snow provided by
The faithful management; but one and all,
As quarto sheets come drifting from the sky,
Express the wish that they had torn it small.
The young wife of Mathias—he who keeps
The Inn—is moaning sadly o’er her child—
A doll —that in the old wood cradle sleeps
All heedless of the paper storm so wild.
Three thousand francs they must have, else within
Some days they will be cast out in the snow
By him that owns the pub—a man of sin
Who yearned to be the good wife’s noble beau
In times gone by. So much we understand
From his fierce lines when he strides in and taunts
The wretched girl, and makes some underhand
Proposals. But a dim suspicion haunts
The minds of all who listen that he can’t
Mean what he says, for oh ! his voice is mild
As that of any gentle maiden aunt,
And who by maiden aunts was e’er beguiled?
Still, the good wife uprises in hot wrath
And orders him to quit. Then in his arms
He clasps her, and Mathias hurries forth
From the dark wings. (Excursions and alarms).
Repulsed, the villain-landlord staggers out
Into the paper night, leaving in peace
The couple who agree there’s little doubt
They’ll homeless be when run out is the lease.
Later, the sound of silver sleigh-bells breaks
In on their counsels, and an ancient Jew
Arrives with blessings, and of food partakes
Whilst frenziedly Mathias eyes the few
Bags of red gold the careless Jew has cast
Down by his plate, and broods upon his need,
Till he decides the scratch meal is the last
The Jew will ever take. To fetch,his steed
He hurries forth. The Jew, who’s overheard
The dull, financial wailings of the two,
Leaves money with a note. (’Tis most absurd
When you remember he’s a Polish Jew.)
And then Mathias, with a madman’s eye,
Comes in and says the horse is at the door ;
The venerable Jew bids him good-bye,
Departs—and is not heard of any more.
Somewhere off-stage poor wild Mathias snares
The Jew and kills him with the household axe ;
Then to the kiln across the snow he bears
The corse. (The paper snow wipes out his tracks.)
The body safely burnt, homeward he hies
Laden with gold; and straight his joyful wife
Waves the Jew’s gift before his bulging eyes
And thereby curdles all his after life.
That is the prologue. Afterwards two acts
Of wild remorse and ghostly sleigh-bells bear
The slayer’s head towards earth. (In furtive tracts
I’ve read of murderers opprest with care
But feel inclined to doubt if it be so ;
Or else why should the morning papers tell
The public—which seems gratified to know—
“ The murderer slept soundly in his cell”?)
But a grim dream, wherein a travelling quack
Draws from his close-shut lips the story dread,
Tortures his sleep behind a wall of sack.
He wakes and, ’fore the family, falls dead.
The thing most wonderful about the show
Was how Annette —a dainty girl was she—
Developed and grew up from what I know
In Act I. was a doll at one-and-three.

the wayside so far back that the remains can only
be descried with a telescope. The haunting music
may have something to do with it; but then
other plays also contain music that haunts,
and this one also contains a good deal that
doesn’t haunt. The Polite Lunatic may be
partly responsible, but the present writer
lias seen plays in which all the members of the
company were obviously lunatics, and the author
was plainly deranged, and the management was
clearly off its head else it would never have staged
the thing, and the audience was so mad that it
wanted its money back ; yet, despite all these
polite and impolite lunatics, the plays didn’t
last. The two men from Portugal may help,
but living as it does in a neighborhood where
the abounding fish-shops, fruit-shops and monkey-
shops seem to be kept by all manner of
Dagoes, this paper has doubts about the value and
durability of any Dago. On the whole, it reckons
that Ichabod Bronson is the influence that makes
for longevity. That tremendous and crane-like
person looks immortal to a reasonable extent.
He is the sort of character who “will live for ever
up to a certain point, and even when he dies he
will only be moderately dead, and he will never
be buried to excess, in a manner of speaking.

Oscar Asche will varnish or dado himself
a pale black on Saturday, and will take his hostile
expression out of the wardrobe and put it on; and
Lily Bravton will suddenly remain her natural
color, and the two of them will play “Othello”
for a limited row of nights. The awful lesson
re the evils of being the childless wife of a bad-
tempered nigger is to start at 7.50, so as
to give it an extra 10 minutes to soak in.
All good White Australians are cordially invited
to attend, and not to weep, for Desdemona’s death
was a blessing in disguise. It made a White
Venice possible. She didn’t survive long enough
to leave a piebald family behind her, and her fate
was a warning which the saddened maids of
Venice took to heart. They buried her with
tombstones at her head and feet, and then went
out and married white men, and nobody with a
countenance like a large polished boot ever led the
armies of the half-drowned republic again.

Sydney’s Bijou Picture Palace is under-
going enlargement and extension ; but neverthe-
less the management contrives to present the
regular programme on a proper time-table. One
film throws a weird light on the possibilities of
fate. A nicely-dressed gentleman and charming
lady stand by a boxed-in sort of arrangement,
which is discovered to contain eggs. Later on,
the drawers which contained eggs are discovered
to be full of chickens, and the lady can be seen
saying most distinctly, “The darlings!” And
the darlings are nurtured, fostered with tender
care, dosed with medicine to keep off diseases,
fed, petted and brought to maturity. And then
there flashes red on to the screen the vision of
Hell—the shooting flames, the turning spit, the
basting fat. It makes one shudder. What
are we being kept for? At the Glaciarium West
is showing pictures of pigeons, pouters, angels,
tumblers and all the rest of them. Spain, where the
revolution sizzles and the ghost of Ferrer haunts
the mighty, reels past, a gigantic panorama of
sierra.and plain, ancient hamlet and modern city
—beautiful but horribly insanitary. At the
Lyceum Spencer is now giving Shackleton’s
films in with the ordinary picture show ;
and the place is crammed in consequence.
Duplicate films are also being shown in Mel-
bourne Town Hall, and great is the rush to
see. One point about these pictures is their evi-
dent genuineness. Had there been any fake
there would have been more hairbreadth escapes;
but they bear the stamp of authenticity all over
them. The rest of the programme is made up in
true Spencerian style. Cowboys chase alleged
murderers after the manner of the cowboys, and iin
Indian love story suggests that the Yankee did
not make for any more romance when he displaced
his copper-colored brother.

Sydney Tivoli sat up and began to
take notice and nourishment on Satur-
day evening last, when the trio of Trapnell
Sisters and their gentle brother George
somersaulted on to the bill. The Trapnells
have broken the ice of dulness which h d
become rather thick at the Riekardian establish-
ment. A large proportion of H. Rickards’ latter
importations have been acrobats; but the four
Trapnells compare favorably even with the whirl-
ing Arabs of some months back. Their per-
formance is novel and smart, and itisreceived with
gratitude for the rest of the programme has few
gleams. Brown and Robinson, the bricklayer-
laborer pair, still persist in singing at the har-
monium instead of building the music warehouse ;
and the Two Bells, Irving Sayles and Fred Bluett
supply moderately refreshing turns. Ronald
George, the young instrumentalist, departs at the
end of the week, and with him go Blake and
Granby. The bill will then either have to lean
up against something fresh or holler for help.

In the round of plays presented at Ade-
laide Royal by the Allan Hamilton Co., “A
Message from Mars ” shines out like a gold tooth
in a nigger’s mouth, and General Desire has
shown his good taste in obtaining several extra
performances of it. It gives George Cross a
chance to be some other sort of hero. The Con-
servatorium is losing Miss Hack, after long years
of teaching the S.A. girl to sing; her farewell
concerts have been the scene of remarkable de-
monstrations. Arthur Otto has also been fare-
welled. (He is going to Europe. She is only
going to marry.) At the Empire are Frank King
and Lucy Lavinia. Other things are mostly
Race Shows by day and Pictures by night.

“ The Flood Tide ” is making ample
amends for “The Great Rescue ” at the Kings
(Melb.). In some respects this story of the bogus
Denny Thompson and the wealthy crank from
Chili is the best of the Drury Lane dramas Bland
Holt has conferred upon Australia. It is
humorous. It gives a nasty smack to Britain’s
military snobocracy ; but is otherwise destitute of
uneasy virtue in its moral teaching. The climax
is wildly original; the tragic episode of the Flood
has a droll centre-piece ; the side-lights bring
cvnical reflections with them, and a lot of
human interest attaches to the horse-race scene,
which is a specially important consideration
just now. The drama, to be sure, goes
far beyond the limits of the company’s acting
capacity, and the performance looks woefully crude
in many places; but the action is so rapid that
the gravest causes for critical complaint can be
dismissed with a smile.
Bland Holt has somewhat improved his
rough caricature of the principal character ; like-
wise Mrs. Bland, as the level-headed Polly who
pulls the strings of his fraud in the interests
of her genial old dad. Styan, on the other
hand, has grown careless in his handling of
the boozy man from Chili. Maxwell ap-
pears to great advantage in comparison
with a job lot of brother officahs. Brown is the
same old sport as before. Miss Ireland wears the
white wig of a blameful life as the highly unscru-
pulous Baroness, whilst Miss Pollock walks
jauntily and unfeelingly through the interesting
part of the Baroness’s daughter, formerly played
by Miss Ireland aforesaid. Another lady—Miss
Dale—is amateurish in a sentimental part, and
there are about 40 minor characters whose names
are recorded in oases of programme amidst an
awful desert of advertisements. In the scenic
department the horse race and the rising of the
waters are only two of numerous moving inci-
dents. “The Flood Tide” is full enough of
entertaining matter to keep business brisk at the
King’s until further notice.
“THE CATCH OF THE SEASON” AT
HER MAJESTY’S, MELBOURNE.
D. B. O'Connor
(Lord Dundreary).
Andrew Higginson
(Duke of St.
Jermyns).
“The Merry Widow” is to occur once
more at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) on Saturday, the
dainty 7 eccentricity of “ The Catch of the Season ”
being deemed not quite the cheese—not suffi-
ciently pungent in flavor—for Cup time audiences.
The Widow on this occasion is to be Miss
Florence Young, for that virile songstress has
recovered from her motor mishap, and will re-
appear like a Florence refreshed by con valescence.
However, the Widow and her proverbial Hat
have still two nights to wait before bursting into
notice. And those people who have held aloof
from “The Catch” would do well to abandon
their aloofness and seize one or other of the
remaining opportunities by its forelock.

The revival of “ Cinderella” at the Royal
supplies about as much novelty as was required to
bring Melbourne back to its old allegiance. The
songs are new without exception—or with one
exception, the personality of Thorley is at least
different from that of the effeminate young man
who played the Prince’s valet a while ago, and
the dances of Tom Payne and Miss Perrin have
been reconstructed. The antics of Thomas, always
an extraordinary feature of the panto., are, in
their latest developments, acutely remarkable.
Also his burlesque of the Apache dance with Miss
Perrin as a sweet girl-bloke who grabs him by the
neckcloth and pulls him about, seems to go one
better than previous burlesques of the same un-
godly pastime. Miss Daisy Belmore looms
heavily in the part of Cinderella’s largest step-
sister, where a more mellow-toned lady used to
roam ; but Cromwell, Brett, Miss Meredro and
Miss Lincoln stand where they have ever stood,
and the spectacle in general, is unchanged, save
for a fresh infusion of limelight or a more tender
expression in the front row of the ballet.

There are times when the Princess’s
awakens from its slumber and shrieks for patron-
age. Another of those periods is about to begin.
Derby night is to bring Nellie Stewart and cq.
back to the acclamations of Melbourne; and the
first item in a list of revivals will be “Sweet
Kitty Bellairs.” On Wednesday of next week
Sweet Kitty converts herself into Sweet Nell, and
on the Saturday following the same lady, having
dropped some of her self-respect at the Court of
King Charles, will defy the eternal proprieties in
the character of Zaza.

Wirth’s Circus continues in strong demand
in Melbourne, especially on Saturday nights,
and the roar of the odorous menagerie is
loud in the land. Also the Skating Rink,
next door to the tent, is haunted by a
multitude of restless citizens; and the Pic-
ture shows thereabouts are prospering as usual.
The Circus doesn’t need to call special attention
to its pitch nowadays. Great streams of humanity
flow in that direction from force of habit, and cir-
cumstances are widening the streams.

Melba’s second concert at Melbourne
Exhibition Building proved a brilliantly memor-
able climax to her long-drawn-out tour. The
crowd was even bigger than on the previous
Saturday, when the chairs in the reserve were
less closely packed. The orchestra put in some
better work. Una Bourne, at the piano, surpassed
herself, under the inspiration of the fact that
it was her birthday. Ranalow (for the first
time in Melbourne) rose to a comparatively
giddy height of popularity with his warble of
Stanford’s sea song, “ The Old Superb,” supported
by the male chorus of the Philharmonic Society.
And Melba, her bodice a blaze of diamonds and
emeralds, was the Queen of Song in her most regal
mood. Rossini’s “ Inflammatus,” of course,
brought down the dome, in a showman way of
speaking ; but it is not as a high C
vocalist piercing a grand musical din that
Melba is at her very best. She sang Massenet’s
“ Sevillana,”and the passionate “ Preghiera” from
“LaTosca.” Her duet with the flute in “Lo! Hear
the gentle lark ” was a pure delight. The critical
ear may detect here and there a speck on the
pearly surface of Melba’s voice. It is a little less
supremely beautiful than it was, but the com-
bined effect of voice, singing and singer thrilled
the multitude on Saturday. After the city has
recovered from its Cup fever, Melba will give a
concert in aid of Lady Dudley’s “ district nursing
extension ” scheme. This is dated for Monday,
November 15.
** * *
Amy Castles is to give concerts at Mel-
bourne Town Hall on Thursday and Saturday of
Cup week. She also will sing the “Inflammatus,”
with the Vic. Festival Choir in chorus, and Peter
Dawspn and tenor Nicol will be the other soloists,
as before. When these two carnival concerts are
disposed of, the Castles starts her Victorian coun-
try tour.

Olympia, the large iron structure that
forms a forefront to Wirths’ Park (Melbourne), is
to break out again as a Picture house. Its innards
have been removed and replaced with other
fittings that will considerably enhance the value
of the building for cinematograph displays. The
man behind the machine is Mr. King, who will
project the films upon the sheet by means of a
tidv-sized engine. The show is announced to open
on Saturday night next.

The arrival of Captain Winston’s educated
Sea Lions is bound to quicken the slackened pulse
of business at the Opera House. On their first
appearance last Saturday the uncanny creatures
were said to be feeling the effects of a long train
journey from Sydney, yet they went through their
duties in almost their best manner. Performing
animals as a rule invite the sympathy of thoughtful
citizens. A dog on his hind legs or a cat
standing on her head is a joyless quadruped ;
but a sea lion revelling in his natural sense of how
to balance something on his nose is a legitimate
matter for amazement. The clever Australian
Wheelers are cycling some more at the Opera
House, also Walter Emerson is revealing his
abnormal height, and colored brother Johnson is
behaving much the same as Irving Sayles. Gwen-
nie Hasto dances rather cleverly, and Bertha
Stuart gives strange renderings of familiar ballads.
Bertha, however, is about to sob herself to another
State, and Franco Piper, a juggling banjoist,
will join the programme when she has gone.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ D.” : I see that J.C. W. has engaged Charles Wyndham
for a season in Australia. He will, no doubt, have a suc-
cess of curiosity, but I warrant that that is all he will
have. As with women, so with actors ; if we have loved
them when they were young and beautiful, we go on in
the old w r ay, more or less, when they are aged and worn
and tired. Londoners have known Wyndham all their
lives. I don’t suppose there is any regular playgoer
of Bullopolis who hasn’t seen Wyndham’s “ David Gar-
rick ” half a dozen times at the least. Londoners never
tire of “ David Garrick ” with Wyndham in the name
part. “Garrick” is to Wyndham’s Co what “ The Belle
of New York ” is to a musical comedy combination—-a
thing to be revived when business gets slack, and an ab-
solutely certain draw whenever and wherever it is staged.
But Australians will see Wyndham play this romantic
role stripped of the glamor of years. They will see an
old, old man (6S and beyond his years), with a face fur-
rowed with a thousand wrinkles and the gait and voice of
patriarchy (excuse the word —I made it myself). He
doesn’t convince any more as the debonair, chivalrous
young mime who made a public exhibition of him
self to prove his great love. Wyndham plays
middle-aged characters incomparably—cynical, genial,
good-hearted worldlings with stacks of excellent advice
to offer those of the company who meditate a false social
step. In speeches of admonition to these foolish ones his
curious booming voice is heard to great advantage.
Mostly, in the pieces he affects, he winds up, after spill-
ing much wise counsel upon the bowed heads of all
parties, by himself marrying the most attractive female
present. But he is now too advanced in years even for
an impersonator of middle life, and the portrayal of
extreme age is out of his line. As aforesaid, I don’t think
those Australians who haven’t known him in his prime
will be much impressed with Wyndham for all his newly-
garnered knighthood.
“ Ita”: On 15/10/’O9 at Melb. Waxworks, Sacco Homann
began his fast of 53 days “ in defence of certain theories
and for the honor of holding the world’s fasting record.”
The honor he can have if it gives him any joy to be classed
with the club-swinging and piano-playing fiends. But I
should like to know what the “certain theories” are.
Mr. Homann is shut up in a glass case with 40 dozen spa.
Does he want to prove that if a man always carries 40
dozen spa he needn’t fear starvation, even if he gets
bushed in the wilds of Woollomooloo or Collingwood for
seven weeks? It seems a silly theory for a man to shut
himself up in a glass case. Besides, if has to load
Matilda with a glass case in addition to 40 dozen spa the
lady will be very liable to burst and hit the theory in a
vital place.
“ Vulcan ”: Interesting to note, in connection with
Lily Brayton’s appearance in “ As You Like It,” that a
popular vote taken by Clement Scott’s Freelance
placed the lady as the best Rosalind on the English stage
by a majority of 55,000 odd votes. She was elected the
best Juliet by another big majority.
A watchman at Wonderland City, Bondi, writes in
bitter protest against the par. of “ Canopus ” (14/10/’O9),
wherein Bilanderson’s place of entertainment by the sea
is described as “a gone-bung amusement resort.”
William’s employee explains that the city' 'vhich he
guards is not dead but sleeping. In one respect it resem-
bles the bear of the uttermost North —it hibernates
during the winter months. “Canopus” is urged to pay
his shilling like a man on December 24 next and pass
within the City gates, and then he will see such things in
the merry-go-round, switchback, scenic railway, katzen-
jammer castle, roller skating, haunted swing and other
lines as will convince him that when he said this vital
resort was a corpse he was screaming up the wrong tree.
“E.M.K.”: Re the business done by the J.C.W. firm
in M.L. “Spot Light” avers that that sound combination
is fairly tearing money from Ward’s subjects, and that I
am, therefore, wrong in saying things theatrical are dull
in the land. I will put just one query to “ Spot Light ”
in this connection. If there is any money-tearing in pro-
gress, why did the Firm try, by public advertisement
and priv itely, to sell a comprehensive tour of the islands,
also seasons in Auckland and elsewhere ? It is a financial
axiom that obtains in stage, as in other matters, that a man
rarely sells the thing he is making big money by.
Randal, of the Clarke, Meynell and Gunn co., claims to
have shed his appendix in record time. He played in
“ Tne Hypocrites ” at Adelaide, went into hospital there,
had the encumbrance removed, and was only a fortnight
to the bad when he rejoined the co. at Kalgoorlie.
•John Gunn, theatrical manager, who died so unex-
pectedly in a Sydney private hospital, was the son of
J. Gunn, who, with his brother Michael, erected the
Gaiety Theatre in South King, off Grafton, street,
Dublin, in 1871. The original of the family was an organ
and piano tuner in Clare-street, close to Merrion-square,
Dublin ; and the female founder of the fortunes of the
house carried on the business of a “Parisian stay and
corset maker ” in the same building. That was in the ’4O s
of last, century. Some years ago a peculiar accident hap-
pened in Dublin, in which one of the Gunns (writer thinks
the father of the just dead John) lost his life. A 'bus-
horse jibbed. Then it backed furiously and shoved the
’bus and the rest of the team into a canal, and some of
the passengers perished miserably, the vehicle being end-
up with the door jammed in the mud at the canal
bottom.
“ Hiphen ”: An amalgamation, trust, combine, or
amicable arrangement of some sort has been arrived at 1 y
tbe Clarke-Meynell-Gunn firm, Williamson and B’l Ander-
son, whereby, instead of flying at each others’ throats,
they agree to browse peaceably side by' side on the green
herbage of the public. The principal reason for this is
the extravagant bidding for plays by one firm against the
other in London. Also, three panto, shows threatened to
eventuate in Melbourne at Christmas. Now, there’ll he
only one—-at Her Majesty’s ; the Royal will have the
Asches, while B’l Anderson’s threatened panto, will be
abandoned, and the hero will be unjustly accused as
usual.
“ Vulcan If Williamson carries out his threat to im-
port Beerbohm Tree and Charles Wyndham en bloc next
year, this country 7 will be invited to enthuse something
extra over two middling mummers at the fag-end of their
days. Writer has his doubts about it generally enthusing
worth tuppence. At their best, both actors stood above
the ruck simply because of the distance between the pass-
ably 7 good and the unrelievedly bad, and they became
“great ” almost solely from the fact that their own measure
was the only measure with which to measure them. Things
have improved considerably since then, but not before
Tree and Wyndham had safely reached the top step.
As with the late Irving in the last decade of his life, they
have become a sort of British institution, like Paunch or
Cobdenism, and now sustain their popularity by lavish ex-
penditure on spectacular effects. The great British pub io
now, therefore, places them beside the Bible (English
version), the Cons’tution, and the Englishman’s Tub ; and
all doubts are blasphemy.
“S.S.”: How much talent does an ordinary brunette
need to equalise the pull that a bunch of fair hair and a
blue eye give to a true blonde?
The success of Miss Essie Perrin,
with “ The ’Ook of ’Olland ”
co., is a strong demonstration
of the value of a fair com-
plexion and a heap of pale-
yellow native wool. This
young lady is a first favorite,
and vet her talents are dis-
tinctly on the mild side. She
sings infrequently and indiffer-
ently. She dances just nicely,
without a trace of the devil-
ment that gives the necessary
lilt and lift to good dancing.
Yet she is an accepted type
of ingenuous, blonde, British
beauty, much in demand for
stage consumption, and the
public has whooped her up,
while remaining dumb to
the superior merits of girls
with brown and black tresses.
Of bourse it is possible for
any girl to be fair nowa-
nights, cut the peroxided
brunette can never get
the lustrous effect of the
blonde who couldn’t help
it.

H. R. Roberts is to play the chief character in Jerome’s
“ The Passing of the Third-Floor Back.” The character
in question is the Redeem r in a boarding-house—or so it
was universally diagnosed when Forbes Robertson played
it in London recently. Roberts’air of placid saintliness
is held to render him particularly fitted for a r6le whose
ideal exponent could only be found by going out of the
ranks of mummerdoni and impressing the services of
novelist Hall Caine.

“0.K.”: In its “Personal Items” of
Sept. 16th issue, The Bulletin announced the
decease of William Henry Boussarde, aged 89,
“ the oldest advance agent and theatrical manager
in the Commonwealth.” Since then Boussarde
must have grown weary of death. It palled on
him, apparently. Anyway, he is still about, and
the other Wednesday afternoon, when he toddled
into the D.U. at Melbourne Opera House, manager
Fred Ayden expostulated with the old chap for
leaving his coffin on a windy day. This was
Boussarde’s first news of his own death. In fact, he
was surprised to hear The Bulletin had buried
him. Boussarde, at 90, is still keeping abreast of
Harry Lyons (also of Melbourne just now), his
rival ancient in theatrical annals. But whereas
Lyons wears the disguise of middle age, the resur-
rected Boussarde owns up to his years.

See where little Willie stands
By the monkeys’ cage':
Keep an eye on Willie’s hands,
M irk the monkeys’ rage.
Hark ! a yell to raise the dead.
Willie’s new straw hat
Snatched is from his little head.
Swiftly plait by plait
His incarcerated friends
Shred the tile like flax ;
Willie’s love for monkeys ends
f In a shower of smacks.
Unto where the llama lives
Willie’s led. Grave, tall,
Calm and bland the llama gives
Confidence to all.
Wherefore Willie with a stick
Prods the creature’s frame,
Likewise hits it with a brick —
All in friendship’s name.
Straight the llama —courteous, he,
Full of old world grace—
Gazing downwards, absently,
Spits in Willie’s face.
As, with anguished sob and pant,
Willie’s madly run
To be cleansed, the elephant
Commandeers his bun.

Willie leaves the Zoo. ;
Loving dumb things more and more—
Worshipped by them too.

A FATLTNG BUSINESS.
FEGAN : "And how’s business , Casey?”
CASEY : “ Rotten, Fegan. You see she’s gettin’ so
damn ould.”
This recent advertisement represents the
ill-gotten half-crown of the S. M. Herald :
MOHAMAD SHAH— MORLEY.— October 15, 1909, at the
residence of the bride, according to Mohammedan,
rites, Mohamad Shah to Lizzie Morley.
There is, unfortunately, no law as yet whereby
the people who thus adulterate the blood of the
white race can be gaoled; but it is to be hoped
that the S. M. Herald has at least the grace to
be ashamed of that half-crown, and to take it
home surreptitiously by a back street.
N.S.W.’s Wade Govern-
ment has decided to send a re-
presentative to Yankee Presi-
dent Taft’s stocktaking of the
world’s natural resources. The
TJ.S. has turned most of its
silent leafy forests into roll-
top desks and yellow jour-
nals, while its iron has been
transformed into railroads and
dyspeptic millionaires. The
wealth with which’’ Nature
stuffed its pockets before it
started out in life is visibly
diminishing, and in its middle
age it finds that it has been
considerable of a spendthrift.
So it is anxious to see what
the other countries have got,
and G. Wade’s representative
will attend with a catalogue
of the Ma State’s Heaven-
sent possessions in his tail-
pocket. The Bulletin is not
sure whether China is to be
represented at the congress.
No one knows exactly what
natural wealth China pos-
sesses; but it has been as-
serted that, in one province
alone, there is enough good
steaming coal to supply the
demand of the whole world
for 4000 years—that is, sup-
posing China complies with
the demand of the world
when the world yells in its
ear that it is out of the sub-
stance. Of course there is no
dead certainty that it will do
so if exhausted Western civi-
lisation is ever forced to ap-
peal either for coal or any-
thing else. By that time the
white man may not be in a
position to talk loudly about
the open door and such mat-
ters, and China may not be
disposed to furnish foreign
fleets with the fuel neces-
sary to enable them to scoot
upon the Chow seas and boss the Chow
roost. To-day the rest of the world is raging
round its doors like a herd of demented bag-
men and demanding admittance for its finished
iron, steel and wood products ; but China goes on
calmly raising vegetables and visiting its relations
on the family wheelbarrow. This chronic con-
servation of natural resources may mean nothing
or it may mean that China is destined to make a
sprint at the finish when the rest of the earth’s
crust is bald of timber and empty of minerals.
In the old age of the world, China may stand re-
vealed as the thrifty Dragon who went slow and
saved up his natural resources by wheelbarrowing
sedately about instead of rushing everywhere in
steel railway trains, and by reading Confucius
instead of Hall Caine and Marie Corelli.
“ 0.,” in reply :
In Tun Bulletin of 7/10/’O9 “Canopus” makes some
rather uncomplimentary remarks about the attendants at
Sydney Museum.
I’m an attendant, and I know “ Canopus ” and hun-
dreds of things like “ Canopus.” They come here and
expect me—a poorly paid attendant—to be a biologist
and zoologist and geologist and Heaven knows what. Yet
when they go into a court of justice they don’t expect the
cop or tipstaff to know the law. If they’re after law,
they interview an old gent with horsehair on his head.'
And when they go to church they don’t ask the verger
for theology. Then why don’t they go to the fountain heads
when they come to the Museum? There are Hedley and
liainbow and Thorpe, with half the alphabet after each
of their names. Then there’s the latest arrival, Hall-
man, B.Sc. of the Sydney University, one of the smartest
young scientists in Australia. These gentlemen and
others give lectures at 10.30 o’clock on Saturday morn-
ings. I told “Canopus” that, but he would persist in
talking to me. I suspected something, and looked round
quick, and caught a man who appeared to be a mate of
“ Canopus” clearing out with the skeleton of the whale
under his arm.
With regard to the stuffed rhinoceros (for whose safety
I am responsible) as many attempts have been made to
steal that bulky specimen as to steal the crown jewels of
England.
“Canopus ” also talks about the attendants at the Art
Gallery. Now, if he really expects an attendant to be an
artist of the first water, he has less savee than a spherical
picture ora spiritual unicorn.
The next time he calls at the Museum I’ll sool the pen-
guins on to him, and let the preserved dragon off the chain.
* * * *
The Bulletin believes that the man who
sends this is more or less of a liar :
Since the Chief Commissioner of Police advised Mel-
bourne suburban residents that a good watchdogis cheaper
and more effective than a policeman, the price of live
dog s meat, especially with a bark in it, has risen so high
in the markets that frankfort and saveloy manufacturers
are at their wit’s end to satisfy the demands of
ravenous racecourse punters. The writer knows for
a fact that at least two leading manufacturers
have been compelled to use beef and mutton.
Dogs, which have hitherto been the unconsidered
perquisite of the official metropolitan dog-catcher,
are now worth much gold, and private practitioners in
the dog-snatching profession are buying Queen Anne
residences. Anything that can chuck a bark louder than
a cough is priceless. Last Saturday, in the course of
conversation with a leading racehorse owner, who retired
about three weeks ago from the dog-snavelling business,
he informed me that he contemplates removing his eldest
son from his theological studies in order that he mav de-
vote himself entirely to following up his father’s late'pro-
fession ; and it is well known that at least three barristers
in Melbourne have left the law, bought a lump of liver
at the end of a string and gone dog-lifting.
A DEAL OF HONOR.
LUCY (passionately): " If you thought that, why
did you marry me?”
HAROLD (gloomily): “ ’Twas a bet!”
J. W. McLachlan, the strange pietist
whom Gippsiand North recently unloaded on the
Victorian Assembly, has stepped serenely for-
ward with yet another measure for the improve-
ment of his fellow-man’s morals. It is in the
form of an amendment of the Crimes Act.
If it becomes law any male who is intimate
with a girl under 20 years of age shall,
unless he marries her within eight months
of the offence, be liable to three years’
penal servitude. An exception is made in
the case of youths or men discovered con-
sorting with acknowledged daughters of Rahab.
It is an enactment calculated to fill the Vic. gaols
up nicely, and with an interesting assortment of
the guilty and the innocent. The blackmailing
female who is not technically Rahab but as near
to being her as not to matter, will here find an
engine of profit ready to her hand. There is
nothing easier to allege than this kind of miscon-
duct, and nothing harder to disprove ; and where
the allegator is young, fair and a female there are
few charges that a male jury credits more readily.
One effect of the passing into law of such
insane legislation as J. W. McLachlan favors
must be the stoppage, in great part, of
harmless, friendly, social intercourse between
the sexes. The lone man will flee like mad from
railway carriages, rooms, houses, beaches, woods
and so on, the moment a lone woman materialises.
Youthful males of a cautious disposition will start
to jib violently at the ancient practice of seeing
young women home. Country walks, wherein
man and maid collaborate, will take on a new
aspect of peril for the man. Maidservants will
be at a discount in homes which shelter bachelors.
The trouble-prospect that opens out is simply
illimitable. One benefit and one alone, so far as
the writer can see, will be conferred on the com-
munity if the proposed amendment is carried.
The mostly-blackmailing breach-of-promise action
will become less frequent. No threat of an action
for breach will be half so efficacious as the threat
which McLachlan seeks to place in the mouth of
her who is after either matrimony or cash.
• * • *
The shrieks of Peary become a trifle less
deafening these days. Peary’s strong point was
that the Eskimo who accompanied Dr. Cook
denied that the doctor had been at the Pole or
anywhere near it. The weak point in this story
was that the Eskimo didn’t call on the New York
papers and say this ; Commander Peary called
and said that the Eskimo said it. A good many
people had begun to think that Peary was wild
enough to say that almost anybody said almost
anything, and they felt that they would rather hear
from the Eskimo through some other source.
Now Knud Rasmussen, a Polar traveller and the
chief authority on the language of the blubber-
eating people, has gone to Greenland and inter-
viewed the Eskimo, and he reckons that their
evidence shows that Cook did reach the Pole. So
the doctor’s stock keeps looking up, while Peary in
the background kicks up a dust of adjectives with
both feet.
The masterly dead silence of the Victorian
police on the subject of crime is giving the re-
porters a little extra trouble and affording con-
siderable amusement to the people at large. The
Department of O’Callaghan has put up such an
astoundinglv bad record within the last two or
three years that it became plain something would
have to be done. The reports in the newspapers
showed that Victoria was a sort of picnic ground
for criminals of all descriptions, and the average
Victorian was tired to death of reading that the
footprints of the murderer on the ceiling were all
that the police had captured. The obvious remedy
was a thorough overhaul and reorganisation of the
entire force ; but the Bent Government was in
power, and Bent was too busy buying land. So the
Master Mind evolved the great idea of withholding
news of crimes from the reporters. Where there
was a corpse and much blood it was impossible to
keep the intelligence from the public; but the lesser
bloodless crimes were wrapped in official secrecy
by men with large feet, and it was fondly but
fatuously hoped that people would gradually get
the idea that crime was practically extinct owing
to the genius of the Department of O’Callaghan.
Of course, as might have been foreseen, the news-
paper men managed to get hold of the criminal news
all the same, and the great idea was killed stone
dead in infancy. But O'Callaghan still sits up in
Russell-street in a mute condition, and the absurd
ukase remains unrepealed.

Hawthorn (Vic.) has a municipal council
after Gregory Wade’s own heart. A while back,
through its neglect of a drain, oneof its ratepayers
took it to Court and recovered damages. The
council then entered on a long course of appeals
right up to the Privy Council, the sole result of
which was a whole mountain range of Costs. But
that didn’t cure it. Recently it perceived a
ratepayer—a co-operative brick co. —creating a
smoke nuisance, so it ordered the co. to quit
making bricks altogether. Though it had power
to regulate the industry, it had none to prohibit,
so the co. appealed. The case got as far as the
High Court this time, with the custotnary result;
and the co.’s bill of Costs has just been handed to
the council to liquidate—£2Bo, to wit. The coun-
cil’s own bill has yet to be met, and the ratepayers
are talking firmly to their representatives, and
asking them whether they have got a son-in-law
in the Costs business, or whether it is just merelj'
cussed ness.
Victoria’s honorarium still indulges his
deep-rooted aversion to the Minimum Wage law
by fining offenders the minimum whenever there
isn’t a P.M. alongside him to correct his re-
actionary tendencies. The other day a P’ran
man-milliner was convicted of paying two em-
ployees 7s. 6d. a week each when the Law had
fixed their wages at 20s. and 10s. respectively.
He had been, in effect, robbing these two persons
of 15s. a week—probably for months. Yet the shop-
keepers on the Bench reckoned a ss. fine in each
case was a fair thing. Now what sort of a penalty
would those same magistrates
think a fair thing for a woman
who went into that shop
and annexed a 15s. hat
every week ? And
how many hats
would she annex
before seeing
the inside of
Pentridge ?

In binding accused over to appear for sentence when
called upon, Judge Murray said “As to these marriage
shops, where people are married at so much per head, I
will not sav anything ; much has alreadv been said by the
Supreme Court Judges about them, if I did add any-
thing, I would speak strongly ; so much so, in fact, that
my language would, perhaps, be too strong for a Court.”—
Daily Paper.
Suppose he spoke ! Suppose he lit a match
And, taking off his wig, applied the flame
With trembling fingers to the horsehair thatch
Until the thing a blazing mass became !
And then suppose he flung it at the Court,
And with a virtuous, judicial snort,
Suppose he spoke !
What would he say? What batteries of speech
Would open fire upon the shuddering globe?
What she'ls of thought would whistle, burst and
screech ;
And would his sanctified, judicial robe
Burst into flame as hotter grew his wrath,
And would red cinders and black smoke fly forth?
Or would he choke
And gurgle like a flooded watercourse,
As words like logs between his learn6d teeth
Piled up and jammed until, with one loud, hoarse
Ejaculation pumped up from beneath,
He shot them out to crush, and maim and slay
The consciences of folk who run awav
And buy a ring?
My word 1 it makes you wince to think what he
Might do if he put on his kicking boots,
And charged full speed right at the diction’ry,
H'd tear the blessed thing up by the roots !
And afterwards he’d gallop round and hit
Each mother’s son of us with junks of it !
The mad typhoon
That takes the tropic forest by the hair
Would b ! dead slow compared to him if he
Cast off restraint and slithered down the stair
Of his great eminence to earth where we
C-awl round and prattle ! What man could outlast
The blist’ring horror of the slightest blast
Of that simoon ?
Good Lord ! we’d rock upon our heels and toes
And fall down on the desert’s face. The sand
Would pile about us till at length it rose
Above our bodies. Then on every hand
A stillness dead would come upon the place
Till from the waste One raised a blistered face
And wailed “ Whaffor ! ”
Then out of Space a Voice judicial might
Vouchsafe to answer: “ With these few remarks
I will resume—although I have not quite
Completed my discourse on love in parks
And so forth. But I trust that what I’ve said
Will be reported by the press and read.

HUSBAND (emphatically): “I can. It was at a

Another champion tired man has been
picked up on the Adelaide to Melbourne railway,
near Horsham. He was a drover, and, being very
weary, lay down for a snooze on the railway
track. Then the Adelaide express came along—
and he is still resting.
The death of Elsie Sigel,
the pretty girl “ missionary ”
of New York’s Chinatown,
has made a notable slump in
the preaching business.
When Miss Sigel’s naked
body was found doubled up
in a box on the premises of
a Chow who is still at large,
she was at first hailed as a
martyr. ■ Then her love-
letters were unearthed, and
people awoke to the fact
that she was merely one of
a band of girl missionaries
whose “mission” was a
cover for a particularly
dreadful form of Asiatic im-
morality, and that her
death had come to pass
UCittu uau oouiv w'
because she abandoned
one Chow lover for an-
other—in short, that she
had been practically torn
to pieces between the
two Asiatic lovers. At
this stage of affairs the
martyr aspect of things
slumped. For a while
after Elsie Sigel’s death
a few girls kept up
the pretence of going
heroically into the
haunts of the heath-
en to save his soul,
and dispense the
Word, and scatter
the Bread of Life.
But the police be-
gan to tell so
many unpleasant
truths that even
the most hardened
young saint among
the m presently
gave it up. Cer-
tain of the older
women, some of
whom were real
saints, still stuck to
the work, but when the
beautiful church of sincere
Chinese oonvei - found that the
pretty young gir.s weren’t coming
any more it revolted, and threw off
its Christianity, and jeered at the Scriptures,
and threatened the elderly missioners with
violence if they didn’t get out. So they got
out, and Chinatown rubbed off its bogus Christian
varnish and went back undisguisecfly to Joss.
Things were possibly hurried upa little by a casual
sort of a row at Hull (Massachusetts). At that place
there were also certain good people who took an
interest in the Chinaman’s soul, and thus an
intimacy sprung up between the yellow and the
white, and one result was a picnic at which the
converted Ah Sin was present in force. But ap-
parently Ah Sin realised that, after the New
York revelations, the game was nearly up, so he
let himself loose in a last great burst. As a con-
sequence, 36 white girls were found, partly
drugged and partly drunk, on an island along
with a very considerable number of Chinamen,
and the U.S. decided that it had found still
another reason why the yellow man must go.

“ Jareel ” speaks :
What a muddled mind the parson displays, as a general
thing, when he gets on his legs in public! Yet it is
natural that he should do so, considering that he spends
about three parts of his waking hours colloguing with
children, old women and male Rechabites. That sort of
mental exercise is enough to render anyone inarticulate.
Rev. Charles Matthews, as well-meaning a young man as
ever went soul-salvaging, gave a dreary exhibition
last week of the cloth’s tendency in the direction of
meaningless verbiage. According to the cablegram he
said that: —
“The woman voter in Australia hail neither advanced
nor retarded reform.... Her often pathetic belief in the
idfeal of home, however, had kept Australian Socialism
sane, and will yet prove a safeguard against doctrines
which menace family life and religion.”
What does it all signify'? Used Australian Socialism to
be insane or to tend that way ? If so, why did Rev.
Ohas. Matthews barrack for it from public balconies
and other high and often egg-haunted places when he
was in Australia? If the woman voter here has had no
reforming influence, one way or the other, how comes it
that she has availed to modify the alleged lunacy of the
indigenous brand of Socialism? How, in any case, is her
“ belief” in the “ ideal obthe home ” calculated tp affect
Australian Socialism, or any other policy, and why
is this belief of hers “often pathetic”? What are the
local doctrines which menace “ family life and religion,”
and require to be leaped upon and rendered innocuous by
“pathetic” female “beliefs in ideals.” Where do the
doctrines live? What State or city harbors them,
and why haven’t their lairs been condemned by the
inspector of nuisances for the district which they in-
fest? And what is the “ ideal of home,” anyhow? Home
regarded as a hollow place to eat in is understandable
enough, but the “ ideal ”is vague and intangible. Then,
according to Mr. Matthews’ clerical brethren out here,
woman is really a childless person practising race suicide
in a flat or doing mixed bathing in a brief costume at
Bondi, and the two pictures don’t agree somehow. In
fact, nothing agrees somehow.

Fat Man may still find a difficulty in
dodging the Undesirable Immigrants Act of the
Heavenly Commonwealth, but lie’s all right when
it’s a question of getting into the front seats of the
earthly tabernacle. Next month, there are to be
gay doings when imported Anglican Archbishop
Wright is to be dumped into his stall at St.
Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, and the faithful are
generously invited to apply for tickets (free) to
see the process. And when the faithful do apply
as aforesaid, they receive a reply stating that the
tickets will be forwarded “ if available,” the reply
being added to a form of receipt for subscriptions
to the cathedral. It’s a million to one that, if the
faithful don’t take the gentle hint and send a
cheque along, the tickets will not be available.
As Holy Writ hath it: “I came not to call
the scutn, but the wealthy lower orders, to enter
into the presence of his Grace the Lord Arch-
bishop.”
BRINGING DISCREDIT ON THE PARTY.
MAUDIE: “Hoi’ up, can’t yer (hie) Muriel?
People’ll be thinkin yer (hie) drunk.”
Pretty well every measure passed nowadays
dealing with the dishonest tricks of “commercial
men’’ emphasises the need for providing plain
bleak “jug” as the penalty for this brand of la,w-
breaking. When Premier Murray passed his
Chaff Adulteration Act, a few; months back, the
usual yell was heard declaring that it would
hamper trade and cripple Private Enter-
prise ; but now that the Act has been in
operation a while things are seen to be
different. Last week a deputation repre-
senting a majority of the chaff-dealers of
Melbourne called on the Minister of Agri-
culture and asked him to enforce the Act
more vigorously. Their reasons were in-
teresting. They had tried to act honestly,
and they found it had paid. They had
put a pure article on the market, and
they had found their customers counter-
manding previous orders for the “mixed”
article. Also they were winning back the
export trade they had lost, and were get-
ting a better name outside the State. It
was Sitate regulation and Government in-
terference, and they liked it and wanted
more of it. But there was a minority that
was intent on swindling the public, which
minority still continued the old dodges of
selling a mixture of a little hay and a.
lot of straw cut up small, and this minority
was not only robbing unsophisticated cus-
tomers, but was trying to undo all the good
tlie honest dealers were doing for themselves
and the State. So they wanted the swindle
squelched. The Minister promised to prose-
cute ; but he didn’t seem sanguine of the
efficacy of the fines that could be imposed. And
that is just where the plain gaol remedy would
come iii. A £lO fine is a trifle to a man with a
£lO,OOO swindle; but a month’s hard labor is a
different affair ; and when the second or third
conviction entails 12 months’ enclosure, the cul-
prit usually alters his point of view.

“ Amos M.” : In the “ General News ” of
Sydney Telegraph I recently disinterred a para-
graph which ridiculed a confused constable, who
stated in the witness box that he didn’t know on
what day of the week Good Friday or Easter
Monday fell this year. If that inaccurate paper
will turn up its issue of October G and look under
the same heading, it will find the following, and
then it can sack itself: —
The holidays that are by statute celebrated on the days
they fall on, or, if on Sunday, on the following day, are
New Year’s Day, Christmas and Boxing Days, Anniver-
sary Day, Good Friday and Easter Saturday and
Monday.
Ed. VII. ’s approaching anniversary recalls
the fact that the heartiest birthday of the kind
which Australia has seen was probably that of
1810. George 111. was King then, and Lachlan
Macquarie was Governor. Government House was
decorated witli greenery, and oranges were inter-
woven with the vegetation until the place looked
like an orange grove. The chain gangs had a day off
and the colony kept holiday. A vast crowd was
invited to Government House, and 80 or 90 sat
down to dinner. Mr. Robinson composed and
recited an ode of stupendous length, and contain-
ing many allusions to the status of the guests.
Behold where Mercy’s genuine fruits appear
Formed by contrition’s hand and fostered here,
said Robinson, with a graceful sweep of his arm
which seemed to embrace all present, and the
men whose sentences had expired and who vvere
then making money applauded joyfully. l'he
Governor, supported and aided by Mr. Robinson,
proposed 19 toasts —including Wellington, the
Archbishop of Canterbury and other notables so
the company had 19 drinks. In degenerate modern
days it would only have about three. Robinsons
ode was printed in the Gazette, and below it was
a notice of the birth of a little Robinson.
Altogether it was a crowded week for Robinson.
“P. Melon”: I found this in my daily
paper recently :
Sir A. Oonan Doyle has published a powerful
indictment of Belgian misrule and atrocities in
the C nitto Free State and is heading a move-
ment for mass meetings for the purpose of
forcing the British Government to take de-
cisive action.
It is the sort of thing that makes mo
tired. While Britain was trailing its
flag in the mud of S’Africa, while women
and children were passing out like
flies in Kitchener’s concentration camps, while
Boer homesteads were lying waste and Boer
fathers and sons lying dead or dying broadcast
all that a few Jew-British syndicates might snare
big dividends, Doyle was hard at it justifying the
infamy in his epic, “ The Great Bouth African
War.” For that- masterpiece of “patriotic'
misrepresentation he was flung a knighthood.
Seemingly he pines for further distinction. It is
well known, and has been for many months, that
much the same .Tew-British speculators who
interested themselves in the Band a decade ago
have now got their predatory eyes on the Con-
go. Belgium is weak. The speculators reckon,
with some show of reason, that if the
little Continental nation won’t grant them
the commercial concessions they want,
it may he made to by the mailed fist of
Britain. Of course, the first step in the
direction of getting the fist in question into work-
ing order is to stir up a quantity of snuffling in-
dignation in the U.K. anent the alleged atrocities
and misrule that characterise the desired land.
That scheme worked well in S’Africa, and it is
going to do the same in the Congo district if those
concerned can manage it. As to the iniquities
alleged against the Belgians in tropic Africa, I
discredit them almost entirely. I lived among
these people for three years, and a milder, more
forbearing lot I never met. To the typical
Briton the mote in his neighbor’s eye ever assumes
the proportions of a locomotive or an Alp, while
the extensive beam in his own dwindles to vanish-

torture and iniquity in one big drapery Dobson sin

than in all the Belgian Congo. It amounts to a
tragedy that a writer of Conan Doyle s calibre

Valley, hill and river
’Neath the wide-spread wings
Silent flow for ever
As my flier swings
Over sunlit pastures
And wide, golden fields,
Where the great cloud-shadows
Glide like 'phantom shields.
In the sky’s blue silence
Hear my motor’s song !
Like a gun it clatters
As I sweep along ;
Hear the fierce, low purring
Of the driven blades
In this deep air-ocean
As the sunlight fades !
Since the dawn I’ve travelled
With the autumn wind,
Now the sunset ruddy
Dies the hills behind ;
But I still sweep onward
In my lonely flight
While the world to stillness
Sinks before the night.
Silver stars above me—
Golden lights below,
And the motor crackling
As through Space I go ;
High aboge strange cities,
Little do I heed
Of Life’s distant troubles
In this dream of speed.
While I steer in silence
Underneath the moon,
Clearly I remember
Things that passed at noon ;
Startled Shouts of farmers
Working,’midst the hay,
As I skimmed above them
On my tireless way.
Now the air grows colder,
And I think I feel
With a gloved forefinger
Dew upon the steel;
I am numbed and dreaming.
Let me think 1 Have I
Fifteen hours been floating
In this empty sky ?
Faint and far the earth-sounds
On my dreams intrude ;
That’s eleven chiming
In the solitude.
One note trembles to me,
But ten others drown
In the dark air currents
O’er the sunken town.
I am lost in darkness,
And an ecstasy
Born of Space and Freedom
Fills the heart of me 1
. Yes, I shall remember—
Earth above my head—
How I flew unhindered
Over quick and dead !

Under the scared heading, “A Tiger in a
Fog,” the Sydney Telegraph (13/10/’O9) published
an excited message from Jamberoo (N.S. W.). It
appears that a man of Jamberoo lately reported
having seen a full-grown tiger, and Jamberoo has
been looking and waiting for the beast ever since.
On Tuesday, October 12, two Jamberooers were
working on a mountain road in a fog when a series
of loud, indignant roars close handy jarred on
their ears and urged them to fly. Being unarmed,
the two Jambrutes flew. It would be a terrible
thing if someone had sewed some striped football
jerseys on a calf and had taken a day off for the
purpose of roaripg terribly in the wilderness.
The jersey dodge was successfully worked some
time ago by a country jester of 9. Australia, and
some gay spirit of Jamberoo may have imitated
the idea. The manufacture of an Australian bush
tiger must be a joyous and stirring performance—
especially when the perspiring tiger-maker runs
the bodkin into the calf’s stummick, and the
lantern gets kicked 1 over by the maddened child
of the cow.
TOO SUDDEN.
" Beggin yer pardon, boss, ’ow far am I from the
nearest pub!"
" Good gracious, why there's one just opposite!"
“ But that's the one I've just left."
“Wang’’draws on his memory for facts
about dogs : .
The most marvellous escape from death 1 ever saw was
that of a fox terrier I once possessed. Foxy was lying
curled up alongside a huge dead gum tree, while I was
digging post-holes near by. There was a strong wind
blowing at the time, and suddenly a great hollow branch
broke off high up, and came hurtling down, endways,
straight for the dog. I shrieked a warning; but I
was too late. The branch buried' itself a couple of
feet in the ground, apparently driving my tyke in-
to the soil beneath it. Presently', to my astonishment
(this is a fact, blokes), I heard him howling in the interior
of the hollow branch. It had dropped clean around him,
like a barrel. I chopped him out, and he had only a bit
of a scar on the back of his neck to show for his narrow
escape. There was another dog I knew—but, no, I’ll
give some other liar a chance.
“Harry J.,” on leatherheads :
There are exceptions to the general bush rule that the
unwhiskered are lacking in taste and talent for blas-
phemy. Take birds, for instance, and in so doing pay-
particular attention to leatherheads, which are noto-
riously free from face herbage. Why the alternative name
of these sin-stained fowl should be friar-birds passes my
comprehension. It is a libel, by implication, on a
respectable body of clerics. Are friars persistent, open
and unashamed purveyors of bad language? Do they
howl horrible oaths in our open spaces regardless of the
decencies, and passing cows and things? Certainly not.
Yet such conduct is, in the case of leatherheads, so com-
mon as to amount to a chronic habit. Some months ago,
whilst travelling a dreary stock route in the North-West,
I squatted myself ’neath the bee-laden branches of a
friendly old box-tree. Presently I noticed a bevy—or,
perhaps, I should rather say a push—of leatherheads
advancing noisily. The members of it were discussing
poison-carts. As they settled over my head, the conver-
sation was in full blast. I have listened to some chat

calculated to paralyse Sunday-schools, and provoke wide-
spread breaches of law and order in my time. During a
varied career it has been my lot to take part in the
capacity of bottle-holder in a Backblocks sectarian con-
troversy ; to stand in close proximity to a promiment
N.S.W. anti-gambling M.L.A. what time the Oup horse
which he had backed was beaten by a short nose;
also I have seen a heavily-whiskered pastoralist
drop and break the only bottle of whisky within
a radius of 20 miles, and I have been forced to
hearken to his commen ts on the occurrence. The leather-
heads’ efforts surpassed all the above in flavor, fruitiness
and virulence. Besides the astounding wealth of lan-
guage and the ingenious diversity of the blasphemies
which they screamed forth, there was a passion and a
force which I have never heard attained by mere humans.
Other curSers whom I have encountered were mostly solo
performers. Leatherheads do their blaspheming in a
deafening chorus. There is a sameness about the human
curser, however hair-covered; the leatherhead never
repeats itself, though it may have had a clean shave that
very morning. In this field of enterprise there is nothing
to touch the leatherhead : Dowie and certain of the
Prophets and early Christian Fathers were his only peers,
and they, alas ! are dead.

The Australian ornithologists, meeting in
Adelaide, have been engaged in robbing the
cuckoo of its claim to intelligence. There has
been a kind of idea that the bird always laid its
eggs in the nest of some species with eggs of a
similar marking, so as to aid deception. She
doesn’t do anything of the kind, says the associa-
tion, speaking officially. She slops her eggs
about anywhere, even in nests that can’t hold the
young bird when grown a bit. She even billets
her grub-eating offspring on birds that would
never think of feeding it with anything but grain,
and so it perishes miserably. In fact, the cuckoo,
long admitted to be a knave, is now written down
a fool as well.

“ Waltz ” writes about an animal which he
may have invented for all this paper knows to the
contrary
Let the eastern gohanha experts hush their chatter
while I talk to them about the western article. The
largest survivor of the antediluvian reptilian monsters
that crawls the earth is undoubtedly the Westralian
bungarra, which reaches a length of 14ft. At first sight
it can almost be mistaken for a young crocodile. It has
always been the staple food of the blacks, who learn to
track it from infancy. When run to earth the blacks will
take hours in digging it out, and then roast it in their
usual manner among the ashes. Its flesh is firm and
white, resembling that of a flathead. Fried in dripping
it makes a good feed. Fried in butter, with pepper and Lea
and Perrins’ added, it makes a man smack his lips for nine
days. A 14-foot bungarra is as big round the chest as a
year-old child, and steaks can be cut off his tail as large
as schnapper or jewfish steak. His top bark is plated
with heavy scaly armor, and: he is brown in color with
yellowish-white stripes, lighter colored belly and striped
legs. A Sierra Nevada runs from the head along
the spine, tapering off at the tail. He is easily'
tracked by his wallowing gait and short steps;
small bushes are trampled on and stones knocked aside
in his path. Bungarra can get a move on when pursued.
His favorite haunts are the enormous excavations of the
boody rat, or in rock crevices. His principal diet now is
rabbit, especially the young, as the rabbits find ready-
made warrens in the boody holes. Opened a 12-footer,
and found stomach to contain 22 lately-bo-rn rabbits un-
digested, several pounds-weight of centipedes, numerous
scorpions, feathers galore, and bones of a young emu.
Best method of catching is by a strong gin trap
securely fastened with a chain at the entrance to a bur-
row. Bungarra is fond of visiting camp-fires at night,
and will steal pannikins, spoons and bright articles. The
“ hens ” lay nine eggs at a sitting equal in size to a fowl’s
egg.. Should this meet the eye of Paddy Doyle, Ntd
Keenan, Doc Silbey', or any of the old Widgeemoola hands
they could all bear me out about the tremendous bun-
garra that resided at Emu Rocks on the old Widgie-road.
He always visited our camp-fires for scraps, and was well
known and respected on that track. He measured 13ft. ;
we several times had the tape over him to settle argu-
ments.
S. C. O. Jessop writes from “ the Edge ” :
I have just been looking at 1000 head of fat bullocks.
When they have a mile spread on them in the early morn-
ing, in grass up to their briskets, they present a fine
spectacle. They feed so earnestly one would think that
grass had not passed down their throats for days. It is
too cold now for flies, else 1000 tails would be waving to
and fro in the brisk southerly. They are from the
Northern Territory, and are going “inside” for sale. I
am reminded of Kipling’s soldiers: “Pore beggars,
they’ll never see ’ome.” Well, the owners don’t breed
them to stay at home—with fats £9 a head.
There’s not a poley in the mob. Two thousand horns
glisten when the bullocks stand and gaze curiously at a
passing camel-train. Long after the desert beasts pass
the cattle lift their glistening noses up in the air, and
sniff uneasily, for the camels must remind them of the
well-oiled myalls, who sometimes spear them from the
lignum when they go to drink. Cattle have good
memories.
There is not a bad-colored beast in the lot. They con-
sist mostly of reds, roans, red-and-whites and whites.
Having filled themselves now, the leaders lope lazily along
in strings, only to be steadied by the ever-watchful
drover, who turns them back gently before the body of
the cattle begins moving.
One seldom hears a good stockman use a whip. Only
newchums and woolly-stockmen ( i.e., sheep-men) use the
whip as a plaything. One loud crack on a cold morning
is sometimes sufficient to cause a thousand restive
“ hornies” to stop feeding and to walk, walk, walk. If
they start that, then the luckless person who was the
cause of it is reminded of his foolishness all day, and
occasionally all through the trip.
It’s not always easy to steady a big mob and make them
feed again. The leaders may be blocked, but the reap
guard marches stolidly along and pushes through what
were the leaders till the whole column is once more
moving. Of course, they can be stopped. They can be
“rung” and worried into a confused mass; but that’s
bad droving.
Ah well, they’re going to market, 1800 miles away. I
look wistfully at the dwindling cloud of dust which hides
my mates, and heave a sigh. - I must stay.

“ Bilbax ” describes a State funeral on the
tinfields: —
Three days’ tramp from Coen, where I had worked d
duffer and “ bust,” landed me at the Excelsior Camp,
where five 0 x B’s and a bough shed, dotted on the red
ribs of a desolate ridge, mark the humblS beginnings of
one of those thriving and populous towns that will deco*
rate our happy land so soon as we get rid of the Labor
party and give Capital a chance to develop our great
natural resources by private blanky enterprise. Four
miners sat under the shed. From their bowed shoulders
and the angle at which their elbows were extended I
divined that “ dinner was now on,” and presently I had
accepted a hearty invitation to “ cut in.”
“Is there a chance of anything here?” I asked. “Yes,
there’s a ten-bob job for you if you know the ashes-to-
ashes patter.” They explained that Battling Joe, two
miles out, had dropped dead yesterday' and would be
buried to-day. Young Bob Benson had gone out with
the tip-dray to bring in the corpse. Before we had
finished our meal we heard the rattle of the approaching
dray. A choked exclamation of “ Spare me days,
boys! What’s this?” brought us to our feet to get a
view. “ It’s old Joe driving his own blanky hearse, and
I’ll swear I see him a stiff’un yesterday. There ain’t
nobody else here got a blue-and-white shirt but Joe.”
The nearer approach of the dray relieved the excite-
ment. It was Bob, all right, and he cheerfully explained
when he pulled up. “ Yairs, ’twus a better shirt nur
mine. Pity ter bury it. So I swapped ’im. I’m goin’ on.
Youse blokes kin ketch up.”
We leisurely finished dinner, but we didn’t “ketch up.”
We met the dray coming back.
“ Cripes ! ye’re slow,’’said Bob. “I wuzzent goin’ter
wait all day for yeh, so I buried him meself.”
“ How did you lower the coffin in ?”
“Backed up and tipped it in, o’ course,” said Bob.
“But it’s orl right. He earn’t get out, don’t you fear.
He’s wrong side up.”
Thus was I robbed of a much-needed 10 bob, and, what
hurt me nearly as much, a chance that I had often de-
sired. For I believe I could deliver an impressive and
improving funeral oration.
“ Boh ” : Young women visitors are “ off”
in one of the new cocky districts of Westralia. A
married couple tookiup land, and then the wife
got the lonely germ badly. She yearned to have
heart-to-heart talks about two-and-elevenpenny
bargains ; so the dearest friend was invited on the
scene. She arrived, gushed over the two-year-old
son of the house, exhibited all her frocks, talked
herself red in the face and then she got the lonely
germ. To fill in time the visiting lady offered to
take out the afternoon tea to the men, who were
“ scrubbing” assisted by a nigger or two. She was
started off, armed with two willie-cans filled with
afternoon tea and buttered scones. She followed
the track for a while, when it suddenly struck
her that she had gone a long way and that she
felt lonely ; so she made a remark that sounded
like “coo-ee” very badly done, and one of the
black assistants jumped out almost from under
her feet. With a wild yell she ran—and ran and
van. Hours later the scrub-cutting husband
arrived home, growling like Father Bear for his
afternoon tea. Then the pantomime started.
First the husband had to ride 30 miles for a
trooper and black tracker. Then he and
his brother tramped round that tract of
country all night. Then they separated and went
in different directions. In the middle of the
next night the husband crawled home on his hands
and knees, his boots in rags. Somewhere the
following morning the dead-beat brother got as
far as the gate. They had to carry him in and put
him to bed. Then the next afternoon the trooper
and the black tracker got back to the happy
home. So a fresh search party started out, and
that afternoon they found the lady. She was
seated on a log eating the last of the scones. In
all her fright she - had stuck to the willie-cans,
and hadn’t been very frightened, because she
knew they would find her. But the hostess who
had two sick men to look after, and the men who
had lost two days’ work, and the trooper who had
put off his wedding to find 9, strange woman, all
took a different view, of the situation.
LOGIC.
THE RIDER: “ Well, I reckon a man's belter off if he settles down."
THE TRAVELLER: “ Well, I dunno. If a man settles down he's got ter settle up, and if a bloke
settles up he hasn't money enough to settle down, so what's (t cove to do?"
THE WRITING ON THE DOOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A hard old rusticated clam
Was bound’ry-rider Slimy Sara.
He lived alone
On Mumblebone,
An’ couldn’t read or even tell
A T from L.
As his pet name insinuates,
He wasn’t one as speculates
In soap an’ scent,
Or ever went
To any superfine shivoo,
Like me an’ you.
Well, this ’ere Sam one day returned
To where his humble camp-fire burned,
An’ found some talk,
In glarin’ chalk,
So big it spread from top to floor,
Writ on his door.
Some urgent message from the boss,
He thought it was, an’ at a loss
What else to do,
He turned him to
An’ took that door, with many, twinges,
Off its hinges.
With utmbst care he gripped it, and
Five miles he humped it Overland,
'Cross stony hills,
O’er ruts an’rills,
Now on his back, now on his head,
To have it read.
He stood i t Up in Murphy's bar,
And shearer-men fronl near and far.
Drew round to see
What; it might be.
As Murphy, pullin’ at his chin,
Read with a grin :
“ Old Slimy Sam of Mumblebone
'S the dirtiest beggar ever known.”
My eye ! when it
Had soaked'a bit.
That party felt so mighty sore
He smashed the door.

0, sweet is the sound of the ag6d farm-fowl
As she cackles down-creek in the heat ;
And dulcet.the drone of the cow on the prowl,
Mooching- by on her musical beat;
O, wild the unrest in the rollicking breeze
When a blazer rrtars out o’ the north—
When the parrokeets raise a wild cry in the trees
And the. roof-iron flaps backward and forth.
0, lovely the crimson and chrome of the sky
When the dawn-birds begin to give tongue.
Ah, me ! For the gleam in young beauty’s blue eye
When we wander farm-maidens aniong !
0, the noise when the skeeters rise up from the,pool
By the farmer-bloke’s blessed abode,
And the shrieks wheh the snakes near the skimtriing-pans
cool
Make Mary jump out o’ the road !
Far, far is the sound of j;he city from us
In this haunt of the cpw; and the duck.
And the wild morning magpie, all language and: fuss,
Concerning the grubs he has struck. 1
Then hear the rude song o’ the famier-man’s boy
As he chases the cows to the bail,
And the noise, up above; of the jaekass, all joy,
As the milk rattles into the pail! •• ,•

“ Dagon,” about a pub and some bones
Leaving Melbourne by its main nor’-west entrance, the
Mount Alexander (old name for Castlemaine) Road, and
following this highway for about 17 miles, you come to a
peculiar and dreary spot, redolent with old-time
memories. It is where the road crosses the Saltwater
River. The stream runs at the bottom of a ravine, with
bleak, stony sides, suggesting a Scotch glen in mid-
winter. Down this steep place winds the road until a
small flat, about six acres in extent, is'reached. On this
flat and alongside the river bank still stands the moul-
dering remains of the old “Oat and Fiddle Inn,” kept
during the height of the digging days by V Tulip ”
Wright, an old Port Arthur Vandemonian—one of
Price’s men,” who, when his time expired, moved to
Victoria, and was celebrated there as a thief-taker, and
later as a property-owner. He possessed houses in
Wright’s-lane, Little Bourke-street West.
The old hostelry was situated in an ideal place for a
pub, for, being at the bottom of the ravine, it was natural
for the teamster to have a spell there before tackling the
long hill in front. There still remains an immense pile'of
bottles in the garden at the back of this place, and the
sandstone steps of the old bar are worn into deep grooves,
as from the hoofs of multitudes.
A lot of lucky diggers disappeared hereabouts, and
there is still alive an ancient servitor of the dead-and-
gone pub—himself a lag, and one of Price’s flock —who is
reputed to tell weird stories as to their vanishment.
A relative of mine was engineer to Sunbury shire (1872),
and when his men were digging holes for the piers of the
new stone bridge they discovered a large quantity of
human bones. I have handled a portion of a human skull
in vself from these excavations. The common explanation
is that they were the bones of diggers who, after being
hocussed at the Oat and Fiddle Inn, were led down to'
the ferryboat, and in midstream robbed, knocked on the
head, and thrown overboard. Public-house methods’
were loose in these days, and such horrors as keeping the
bar open after-hours and Sunday-trading were quite
common—to say nothing of worse things than these.
* * * *
From “ Mallarapponie ” :
The Bulletin (16/9/’O9) makes allusion to such persons
as extra tall dwarfs and very short giants, though it
appears to entertain considerable doubt as to the exist-
ence of the same. I arise to remark that such persons
do exist. I have met them.
“Stump” Hagan was an opal-gouger down at Sand-
stone, and he measured sft. in his hoof-gear. He was a
curtailed sort of little man was Stumpy ; but the main
deformity in his growth was his legs. Bodily speaking,
he was designed for a six-footer.
Then there was “Long” Stevens, the tall cattleman
from Merlin’s. Stevens’ build was remarkable insomuch
as he resembled that curious fowl, the stilt. His alleged
elevation was something over a fathom in his bald feet,
but had the length of his understandings been in propor-
tion to his spine, he must have measured a good deal less.
One evening we were carousing at Nulty’s pub down
at Wild Oat, and both “Stump” Hagan and “ th’ Long
’Un ” were there. Hagan was the sort of man that didn’t
drink grog—he fairly rushed it. Anyhow, early in the
evening he accidentally drank Stevens’ beer—at least, he
said it was an accident. But Stevens became annoyed,
and made some bitter remarks about “ hums.” “ Stump ”
took the bitterness to heart and offered “ ter give th’
long cow a fly fer it.”
“Gam,” muttered the good-natured Stevens, “I’d
hate ter ’ave ter ’it such a little cove as you.”
That made Stumpy furious. Out of the profanity of
his language we discerned declamations to the effect that
he was"a bigger blankv man than Stevens.
The long cattleman remarked “ Garn 1 ” again and
smiled disinterestedly.
Then the opal-gouger flourished a clenched fist under
the cattleman’s proboscis and fairly howled.
“ I’m a taller blankv man than you sittin’ down, yer
blanky long cow ! ”
“ Betcher 1 ” drawled the long ’un, lounging against the
bar.
Hagan was forcibly cooled down, and level money was
put up—£l each.
A slab stool was placed in position, and the tall stock-
man first took his seat, sitting bolt upright against the
bar door. We scratched his sitting elevation on the
door post with a corkscrew, and then the gouger took
his seat. Stumpy squatted like a Hindu idol while we
scribed the height of his skull on the woodwork, and
when he arose it was found he had topped the cattle-
man’s altitude by a good inch. When the rest of us re-
tired for the night we left the tall dwarf and the short
giant fraternising at obtuse angles to the bar and hitting
successive long beers to leg with great energy.
WARM.
THE SEEDY ONE: "Say, Guv’nor, there's a fly on yer nose!"
OLD PARTY: “ Wot the devil has that to do with you?"
THE SEEDY ONE: “ Nothin' , nothin’l Only I thought it would get its wings scorched!”
“ Edyson ” : I see that Albert Spicer, the
British commercial person, concerned himself
somewhat with our birth-rate problem, and made
the,very luminous suggestion that the Australian
baby crop would, in • all probability, be improved
if motherhood’ were a more honored institution.
His notion of jthe proper method of glorifying
motherhood; was “ a badge of honor ” for mothers
Of large families. • The exquisite notion that the
birth-rate would be boosted if the mother of ten
were made a sort of K.C.M.G. displays an in-
genuous type of mind one would scarcely have
expected to discover in big trade. But Albert is
not original. The idea has been put into execu-
tion to my own knowledge. Thai lon, who was
chief engineer on a poultry-run outside Geelong,
and had a reputation for his diverting moral
kinks, tried out the Spicer theory years ago.
When we visited his hen farm I noticed that one
proud barndoor fowl was strutting about, with a
dazzling pewter medal hung on her crop.
“What’s that for?” Tasked. Thallon answered
behind his hand. “ That’s a
medal for egg-laying,”
he said. “I give it
to the hen that scores
highest for the month.
You’d be surprised to
see how it encourages
them.”
Peary, the man who
lost his temper looking
for the North Pole, made
one discovery whilst
among the ice—he ob-
tained some information
regarding the Devil’s wife.
Most people were under
the impression that the Devil
was single ; but, according to Peary,
the two Eskimo who travelled with
him, on their return to camp, yelled
and danced and ascribed their fast
progress to the fact that the Devil was
asleep or having trouble with the
partner of his flames and ashes. How
the small, oily man, whose life is one
long freeze, managed to get hold of
the picturesque idea of the Devil’s
missus is a blank, cold mystery. It
may be that having to stay at home
for six months at a stretch in his ice
wigwam has made him feel bitter
towards the sex. The stale blubber and
the stale arguments and the yelling of
the baby must get terribly trying after about
the fourth month. The only possible outlet for
temper is to rush round to the back of the mansion
and kick the family bear hard. When you come
to reckon things up, the Eskimo has as good an
excuse as anyone for thinking the Devil is
married.

THE SINGING SOLITUDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When, in dim lights, you wend along
ways of Narbethong,
You’ll hear a quavering elegy,
A quaint, elusive threnody,
A changing, echoing forest song
Sung in the hidden umbrages.
For there, when all the world’s asleep,
The lonely fells and gullies steep
Ring loud with native minstrelsy ;
Like beating wings of melody
It swells and dies down valleys deep
In evanescent cadences.
The trees are pillars in vast halls
Through which some tuneful spirit calls
Some ancient mystic monody ;
And out of night’s immensity
The wandering moonlight frets, and falls
On aisles in chequered traceries.
Out of abysses, wells and rings
No human music born of strings
Of harp, or flute, or psaltery,
Of shawm, or lute, or cymbalry ;
But some aerial being sings
Of dim eternal mysteries.
When, in dim lights, you pass along
The singing fells of Narbethong,
Give ear to that strange monody,
That weird elusive melody—
The echoing, changing forest song
Sung in the hidden umbrages ! ,

When one thinks of the fact that not
millions, but milliards, of microbes and bacteria
•—of which this actual photograph of a minute
drop of tooth moisture forms a specimen—are
living in a neglected mouth, it seems nothing
less than disgusting to allow such destruction
to continue in our mouths and teeth.
It is simply incredible that there still exist
many educated people who refuse to realise
that it is an
absolute ne-
cessity not
only for the
preservation
of the teeth,
but also for
the general
health, to
take regular
care of the
mouth and
teeth.
Odol arrests
most thoroughly and effectively all fer-
mentation and decomposition in the mouth.
Everyone who uses Odol regularly every day
insures the greatest protection for his teeth
and mouth that scientific discovery has up to
the present time made possible.
This liquid antiseptic dentifrice is daily used
by thousands of doctors and dentists them-
selves.*

J. B. Watson, the Bendigo mining mag-
nate, died in 1889, leaving about £500,000 worth
of property which, according to his will, was to
be hoarded up for 20 years and then realised and
divided. Owing to the financial storm that blew
in 1893 the fortune hasn’t accumulated as was
expected; still it has borne up fairly well. The
old man’s pile got a casual mention in court the
other day, when our expensive friend Gentleman
One hired his costly friend with the brief in his
hand and the traces of the dead horse on his head
to ask for “ directions.”
NO WONDER!
No less than three-quarters of an hour behind time the
Sydney express, with the New South Wales Parliament-
ary team on board, arrived at the Spencer-street station.
—Recent News Item.
Last week saw the end of the beginning of
a new sect in Sydney. When Tremayne Dunstan
oarnea financial cropper at the Pitt-street Congre-
gational Church—“ Mr. James’” church, where
the S. M. Hekald’s young men used to graduate
in holiness —he set up a tabernacle of his own,
and called it “the Whitefield Church,” one
Whitefield having been a mighty preacher in
Wesley’s day. Between times the “church”
made a precarious living as a marriage-shop; but
finally T. Dunstan (the gentleman who expressed
the pious wish that The Bulletin office would be
the first place in Sydney that a Japanese bomb
would drop on) moved on to some other stand,
whereupon “the Whitefield Church” fell into
other hands, and last week it straggled back into
the Congregational fold.
x Mrs. Waterhouse, who died at Hawthorn
(Melbourne), recently, was the widow of Rev.
Joseph Waterhouse, at one time in business at
Adelaide, who was drowned in the wreck of the
Tararua on the Maoriland coast in 1881. He was
induced to join the ministry by Rev. .T. Draper,
who was drowned when the London sank in the
Bay of Biscay in 1866. Clerics seem to be a
drownable lot.
Australia’s old cursory acquaintance, Wil-
bur Glenn Voliva, formerly “Elijah” Dowie’s
chief apostle in these parts, has blasted his way
into gaol at last. It was a small matter of defa-
mation somewhere in Illinois, and the Court said
gaol in default of the payment of a 10,000-dollar
judgment. Voliva’s remarks are not recorded ;
but at latest the successor to the prophet had
started to do the six months.
“R.,” from Melbourne :
The faculty of clearing the House by speech is a gift*
like music or a talent for absorbing, unharmed, vast
quantities of beer. In the Reps, the three leading ex-
ponents of this quality are Crouch, Willy Kelly, and King
O’Malley. Crouch is unpopular personally. He has at
one time or another got many members’ backs up by his
harsh, sly and unconscionable methods. There are quite
a number of men who consider they have been let in poli-
tically in some small (but none the less exasperating)
fashion by the man with the doubled-up name. So
whether Crouch has something to say, or whether he has
nothing, the House empties like a punctured billy the
moment he rises.
Willy Kell}' aspires to a mastership in the way of flouts
and jeers. About once in 18 months he gets rid of a pal-
pably pre-considered impromptu that is worth a mild
smile of approfiation. But mostly he gibes with a heavy
hand, and in the polysyllabic phrasing of a Danvell
O’Connor. Willy never uses a word of one syllable
if a longer one is available, and he won’t use
a longer one if he can find a longest one.
He does these things with the elaborate man-
ner of the Prime Minister of drama. And as he
appears to know nothing, or as near nothing as not to
matter, has no ideas beyond those he culls from his daily
Argus or Sydney Telegraph, and is invariably from 18 to
27 miles behind the legislative’bus of the moment, his
orations make for dulness. Kelly drives his fellow-
members forth because be bores them, and in despite of
their better feelings. Personally, he is well enough liked
and esteemed as an amiable youngster of the harmless
order. Of late he has become dejected over the recep-
tions accorded his'speechifyings, and has lapsed into more
or less gloomy silence. And the House is the fuller for it.
King O’Malley, with his hat, his awful voice, his wild
whirling geyser of verbiage, ever ready to be exploded all
over the heads of the people’s elect, is a different proposi-
tion altogether. Crouch and Kelly merely weary their
associates. King O’Malley renders them murderous and
suicidal. He takes rank with Jawbone Neild as the Com-
monwealth’s leading political posturer. All the world
dislikes a posturer—most of all when he is a talkative
posturer. In the present state of our criminal law it is
inadmissible to silence such folk with guns, and as the
Reps, are, on the whole, a law-abiding lot, they take a
firm hold on their emotions when the wild man from Tas-
mania starts, and break for the outer air. There are other
Parliamentary bores. Johnson of Lang acts on the
House like some overproof soporic ; the snarls of Joe
Cook are unpleasing to its collective ear ; Bruce Smith’s
platitudes tire members, though respect for their utterer’s
sincerity makes them conceal the fact to a certain extent.
But the three weariers of the flesh and spirit enumerated
above stand at the head of their class. They are top-
notchers—true champs at the gentle art of House-
clearing.
Sydney papers the other day, noticing the
death of Mrs. H. H. Kater at the age of 89,
stated that the lady was sister of the “first
Attorney-General, Mr. J. B. Darvall, who was
appointed in 1857.” The daily papers’ history is
astray. Mr. Saxe Bannister was the first Attorney-
General, appointed in April, 1824. That, of
course, was before Responsible
Government. When that happened
William Manning was first Attorney-
General ; and Mr. Darvall did not
become Attorney-General until May,
1857, in the Parker Ministry—the
third under Responsible Govern-
ment. He was Solicitor-General in
the first, or Donaldson Ministry,
and for a time also in the third.
Mr. Saxe Bannister, the pioneer in
the law business, fought a bloodless
duel with a brother barrister, Dr.
Wardell, in October, 182(5, and re-
tired from the Attorney-Generalship about the
same time.
An old N.S.W. Pfess Gallery scribe on
the idiosyncrasies of Alf Edden, the strong man
of the N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor party:—
There is probably more individuality in Alfred Edden
than in any dozen members of the N.S.W. Assembly.
From the coalpits of England he emigrated to the
collieries of Newcastle. He is broad-shouldered and
stout-limbed, and only his snow-white hair and iron-grey
moustache convince you that he is no longer young. He
is as athletic as Tommy Burns, with a rich olive complexion
and a robust, ringing voice. He first entered the
Assembly for Northumberland over 18 years ago, and has
held Kahibah since the Redistribution (July 17, 1894). It
would be easier to lift Nobby’s, at the entrance to the
Hunter River, than to shift Edden from Kahibah. He
made an impression with his maiden speech in the House in
Macquarie-street, andhe hasdeepenedthatimpression ever
since. Had he belonged to any other party but cold-shaded
Labor he would have been Minister for Mines long ago.
Had he been less robust, audacious and decisive he might
have been considered sufficiently “ safe ” to lead Labor
in Parliament. There is, strangely enough, an idea in
N.S.W. Parliamentary Labor circles that the leader must
be possessed of Sunday-school traditions, as witness
Joseph Cook and James McGowen. That’s possibly why
Labor, after 18 j'ears in Ma State politics, is least success-
ful in pursuit of power, with the exception of Labor in
Victoria. Edden might have improved the pace if
placed in the lead —and there’s more Parliamentary
wisdom in Edden than in the collective Wade Cabinet-
eers. Generous instincts and family responsibilities
have kept him in the financial position of his
least lucky fellow coalminers, and he has never
been able to gratify a natural desire to revisit the
English coal pit in which he was an apprentice, and to
mingle once more with his “townies.” A few years ago
he lamented that he had never been able to spare £lOO
for that trip. W. P. Crick, then new to office, happened
to hear of Edden’s ungratified wish, and he filled in
and signed a cheque for £lOO. “Here, Alf. This will
see you through. See your people and come back to
bury your old bones with us.” Alf modestly demurred.
Crick insisted. “ No, Billy,” said Edden, next day, with
a lump in his throat, “I can’t cash this. It wouldn’t be
right. My party is supporting - your Government. A
wrong construction would be placed on your kindness.
Take it/old man, and my thanks all the same.” “Well,
give it to the missus for a new dress and a bit on my
horse,” and Crick walked off. In the presence of some of
his colleagues Alf Edden committed the cheque to the
flames, and thereby destroyed his only chance of revisit-
ing England.
Sid Long is another art-bird who medi-
tates a Bullward flight. He hasn’t been doing so
much work lately as was expected of him, and
has given up to the laborious and thankless job
of teaching the time and energy and talent that
were meant for Art. But now he is gathering up
his tooth-brushes and other utensils, and is going
down into the country for a spell of landscape-
painting. Next year he will come back to Sydney
like an elephant refreshed, and with a cubit or two
added to his stature round the waist. Then he
will exhibit his pictures and take his ticket for
Bull-parts and Europe generally.
MATTHEWS, M.H.R. FOR “ THE PORT,”
MELBOURNE.
Clement Giles, the Adelaide man who has
done most to build up the biggest thing in the
way of farmers’co-operative societies in Australia,
threw up the job of managing-director the other
day, and went to England to represent the con-
cern there. Most of Giles’ work for the society
has been done in the last 14 years, during which
period the members have increased from a few
hundreds to about 5000. This year the concern
expects to handle about 4,000,000 bushels of wheat,
besides wool and other stuff ; a big lot of it goes
to the co operative mills run by the big wholesale
co-operative societies in Bull’s Country. Before
Giles took to co-operating he was squatting ; but
the usual drought happened. There was luck in
that particular drought for the S. Australian
farmer—it has saved him from the exactions of
many a middleman since then.
They have discovered a new method of
dealing with militant Laborites in the Cold Land.
They make them knights. Two
years ago, William Crossman
was a stonemason of Cardiff,
and in between whiles he re-
presented, in the Labor interest,
a ward in the local city council
and for so doing was paid a
salary by his party. Ned VII.
came along, and before the
wretched Crossman knew what
was happening, he was knighted.
It ruined him. Last month the
Cardiff Trades Council told
Crossman that it didn’t want a
rep. who bore the stigma of a
knighthood, and it called on Wil-
liam to terminate his agreement
as a Labor Councillor at the end
of the current year. William
complied sadly, but without
argument. He appreciated the
justice of his colleagues’ atti-
tude. Now William is out of
the Labor movement and ad-
dresses his energies exclusively
to stonemasonry. Meanwhile Laborites m a score
of centres are watching the movements of Ed.
VII. with feverish anxiety. They realise that he
may be a fairly ruinous monarch to meet.
E. D. Williams, one of the founders of
the big Castlemaine (Vic.) Woollen Mills, and for
a long time past the managing director, died sud-
denly on October 17. He arrived in Parliament in
James Beef Patterson’s day, after the “retrench-
ment dissolution,” when the ex-butcher said he was
going to cut the civil service to the bone if it
didn’t watch out. (Patterson was a retrencher all
through ; “ I call that a dashed blanky waste,” he
said once when he inspected a slaughter-house
and saw the blood being allowed to run
down the gutter.) Patterson and Gordon had
represented Castlemaine, and it was thought
that Gordon would just squeeze through, carry-
ing the Premier in on his back. But instead
of carrying Patterson in, Gordon couldn’t get in
himself. Williams was first, Patterson second.
This was the first election in which the Vic. Labor
party succeeded in making a decent show. A
year or two afterwards J. B. Patterson died, and
Lawson took his seat. Then, when Castlemaine
electorate was altered and one member was taken
away, Williams decided that he had quite enough
to do with his woollen factory and his mines, so
he left Lawson in undisturbed possession.
Ic is not generally known that Henry
Parkes had, or thought he had, a second Christian
name—Faulconbridge, alleged to be his mothers
maiden name. In a letter to his sister, from
Sydney (Sept. 22, 1840), the future Premier signed
himself “Henry F. Parkes.” A family explana-
tion is that he only thought of adopting Faulcon-
bridge, and finally dissuaded himself. In that
letter he wrote :
I am now in a position which promises not only to pro-
vide me comfortable bread, but to enable me to save a
little money. You have doubtless heard of such gentle-
men as Customs House officers, whose business it is to
catch smugglers, seize contraband goods, etc. Your
humble servant is one of these. I spend most of my time
on board ships, where I have a good deal of time to write
poetry —I have enough already to fill a book, most of
which has been published in a Sydney newspaper. But I
intend to apply some of this waste time to bet. er pur-
pose—that of writing a series of letters to you and other
dear friends in England, descriptive of this country.
The spectacle of Parkes pursuing contraband and
poetry at the same time must have been thrilling.
“Henry Horsecollar ” writes:—
The statement that the deceased theatrical manager,
John Gunn, made his first stage appearance in a piece called
“ The Birthplace of Podgers ” awakens one of these vague
memories that are like the bright ideas we have w’hen we
are just waking up in the morning. There never was any
person named Podgers—such a thing is impossible, just
as it is impossible to be Bodgers and difficult to be Rogers
—but when an old Londoner hunts away back among the
hazy tombstones of memory he finds at last that it is
Mrs. Prodgers he is thinking of. It seems impossible to
be Prodgers, yet the deed was achieved. Mrs. Giacometti
(pronounced “ Jackometti ”) Prodgers was the terror and
misery of London cabmen in the days of my boyhood.
They fled from her as from a pestilence or a mad dog, and
she ran after them and had them hauled up for scattering
into the dim distance when she had signified, by holding
up her umbrella, that she required their services. The only
time the affluent Mrs. Prodgers ever paid the legal fare was
when cab 193,472 had fled from her signal, and she had con-
trived to hire cab 274,391 and go in pursuit. If the second
cab got close enough up to the first cab to enable Mrs.
Prodgers to identify it for purposes of prosecution, she
was so pleased that she sometimes paid cab 274,391 its
legal fare, but not a penny over. More often she paid
6d. or nothing, and then the police court proceedings
consisted of Mrs. Prodgers prosecuting one cab, and
another cab prosecuting Mrs. Prodgers. She was always
being prosecuted by cabs. Cabmen regarded her as
the Devil. She would drive four miles and worry the
driver on the way with 27 different and contradictory in-
structions. Then she would alight and, with a queenly
air, tender the jehti tid. or so. Language had not the
slightest effect on Mrs. Prodgers; besides the cabby
seldom got a chance to use any. The lady’s capacity for
alighting within 2ft. of a policeman was something
wonderful, and with the officer of the law on the
spot the cabby dared not say 1 per cent, of what
he wanted to for fear of prejudicing his case.
Even if there was no policeman on the spot
when Mrs. Prodgers got out of the cab, one was
sure to arrive in a minute or two ; a sorb of wireless tele-
graphy seemed to convey the news that Mrs. Prodgers
was getting out of a cab. The cabby never asked her
name and address when she tendered him the fid. (some-
times she didn’t tender anything); the man who didn’t
know Mrs. Prodgers was unfit to drive a cab in London.
His horse could have told him her name and habit-
ation. The lady herself never used language to
the cabby: she only looked at him like Moses
looking at pork. No rows were ever conducted with more
decorum than those between Mrs. Prodgers and the cab-
men ; she was cold and calm, and he was suffocated by his
feelings and by the knowledge that he was up against an
enemy who knew all the points of the game. In court
the cabby got his legal fare—it was astonishing how
small the legal fare was when Mrs. Prodgers had had
the distance measured and all the by-laws looked
up ; and other penurious clients made a note of the
points she elicited, and preserved the note for future
reference. Cabby also got the smallest possible amount
for lost time. The costs Mrs. Prodgers paid cheerfully.
Then she would pass a friendly compliment with the
magistrate and go forth to hire another cab. It is in-
teresting to learn that the late John Gunn made his
theatrical beginnings in “The Birthplace of Podgers.”
If the London cabbies could have found out the birth-
place of Mrs. Prodgers they would have gone there in
force and burned the place to the ground.
THE POINT OF VIEW.
He said he had seen Yass-Canberra, and he regarded it
as a very desirable site. When remonstrated with, Sena-
tor Russell turned the attack by reminding his fellow-
Senators that that day he was celebrating his 77th birth-
day.—A Senate debate item from Argus.
ANCIENT AND SELFISH M.P. : "'Earens , fancy
growlin’ about this! Where could yer find
a nicer an' drier place t' be planted than ’ere?”
A venerable reminder of the early days
passed out at Bathurst (N.S.W.) last week, when
Alexander Septimus Piper died. He was son of
Captain John Piper, of the old Rum-selling Corps,
who became Naval Officer or Collector of Cus-
toms, and he was born at Point Piper (Sydney) in
1824. His mother was a Miss Sheares, whom his
father married at Norfolk Island. Captain Piper,
when he left the public service, settled at Alloway
Bank, near Bathurst, in 1830. He originally came
from Ayrshire. A brother, Henry Piper, still
lives at Bathurst. The name will not die out, as
Alexander Septimus Piper has left over half a
hundred Pipers behind him.
LADY DUDLEY SERVES TEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The rector asked Lady Dudley to say a few words, after
she had taken her place as a volunteer to hand tea
f“ Never did tea taste better ,” said one of the Usuals, who
absorbed two cupfuls from the white hands of the
Government House chatelaine). —Australian Star.
The Usual swoons with delight—
Swoons helplessly, wholly away ;
The Universe glows with a light
Unearthly and weird, yet gay ;
And all things are shining and bright
As the midst of a midsummer day.
Aloft, in the shuddering trees,
The sparrows and other winged fry
Are dumb with astonishment. These
Are disorganised sorely ; they fly
With none of their old pristine ease
And a stunned sort of look in the eye.
On sidewalks, in streets and in trams
Men pause with their hands to their brows;
They're wild with amaze. Telegrams
Flash over the wires as the hows
And the whys of the ease, amid damns,
Are frenziedly canvassed. The cows
Desist from revolving the cud.
And lean, in a stupefied state.
On fences, their fainting forms stud,
Each paling and railing- and gate ;
Some even lie down in the mud,
Where they die at a terrible rate.
The restaurants echo with screams
Of protest and agonised rage ;
For mutton like fried bacon seems,
And fish tastes like onions and sage.
The waiters suggest folks in dreams
Or lunatics pent in a cage.
And ever the cause of it all—
The Usual—amid the remains
Of her tea-cup lies flat in the hall
Where she first knew the pleasures and pains—
The miraculous things that befall—
When mere Us-u-als meet Chatelaines.

Eighteen months ago this bank started an officers’ provi-
dent or pension fund with a grant of £lO,OOO. As that
was a pretty large special vote, it is shown in the fore-
going table. In each of the last two half-years a vote of
£lOOO has gone to the same fund ; but these amounts
have been deducted from profits, being regarded, in fact,
as working expenses. The half-year hasn’t been as profit-
able as most half-years have been lately. Gross profits
have been slightly less, because by recent defalcations
the bank lost £3599 ; and current expenses have also been
considerably heavier. It may be that, to explain the
increase in expenses, the bank has been smitten in its
conscience and has given its clerks a rise all round ; it may
be that it has been spending a lot of money to find out
if there are any more deficiencies on the premises ; or it
may be that repairs or something of the sort have been
heavier than usual. Anyhow, calculated on capital and
reserves, net profits have lately moved this way :
Mar., 1906.. £7 7 11 p.c. Mar., 1908.. £8 7 2 p.c.
Sept., 1906.. 7 6 9 „ Sept., 1908.. 719 3 „
Mar., 1907.. 8 3 8,, Mar., 1909.. 8 0 7 „
Sept., 1907.. 7 2 4,, Sept., 1909.. 614 8 „
For the last three half-years £lOOO has been debited
against profits to cover what may be regarded as the
ordinary vote to the provident fund. Taking into
account the fact that for every £1 of its own money the bank
has the use Of £5 Bs. of the public’s money held on
deposit alone, and taking further into account that the
bank has less than 29 percent, of its liabilities held in coin
and liquid securities, the above figures relating to profits
are by no means high. In fact, they might reasonably be
expected to be higher. One can’t, however, tell
from looking at the outside why profits are small.
Assets may be over-valued, or there may be unpro-
ductive accounts in the books ; and a manager may be
using up undisclosed profits to write down over-vaiued
items. Or, on the other hand, a manager may come to
the conclusion that, just as bad debts have been made in
the past, so some must be made in the present; and he
may be providing for them beforehand—which is a very
wise thing to do, though there are some managers who
are not able to do it, being still too busy wiping out the
sins of their predecessors to attend to any that they may
be committing themselves.
The Colonial’s balance-sheets provide food for
these comparisons:—

Considering that it was born in 1888, just when a whole
lot of financial youngsters caught an epidemic which was
fatal to many of them a few years later, this bank got
through its troubles very well ; it certainly wrote off half
its paid capital, reducing it to £150,000, and knocked off
dividends for a few years. Then, with very good and
influential city backing, it proceeded to push out; and it
is still pushing. Little by little more capital has been got
in by the issue of another 150,000 shares, and handy-
sized premiums on some of these new shares have also
been passed to reserves. To-day, therefore, the capital
is the old £300,000 ; but nowadays it is in 300,000 shares
paid to £1 and liable for another £3. In running the eye
down the column headed profits, this increase of capital
must be kept in mind. As a matter of fact, things
haven’t been quite so good lately as they were. Cal-
culated on the basis of capital and reserves combined,
recent profits have been as follows:
Mar., 1906 .. £8 9 9 p.c. Mar., 1908 .. £9 9 9 p.c.

It is still a very satisfactory result; and it will look
more satisfactory still if nothing has to be written off in
the next few years in order to wipe out losses made
through advancing too liberally in these times of high
prices. This particular bank hasn’t, however, lost its
head and rushed its advances along at great speed.
Though it has £lOO,OOO more capital than it had 12
months ago it has less money out in advances. This
shows that movement and some others

The very big increase in liquid assets has been partly due
to the new capital, but mainly to a big addition to the
interest-bearing deposits, this bank having snared about
£300,000 of the last State loan ; but that Won’t last long.
Probably the Royal didn't really want the money;
still, for one of the smaller banks that has
yet to do some struggling to reach the top, it
was a very good advt. Having all this money on hand
the cash position is very strong ; liquid assets are equal
to 54 per cent, of the total liabilities. It is a virtue, of
course ; but it is quite likely that the bank would very
willingly get rid of some of it if the management could
meet a few satisfactory borrowers.

The Queensland banks, all of them frightfully hard-hit 17
years ago, have battled their way through splendidly. Of
course, Queensland’s natural powers of picking itself up
are very great ; but, apart from that, all the banks up
that way had an almost complete clearing out after the
troubles ; and the new men didn’t think it necessary
to say that the old men had made merely small
mistakes of no consequence. Instead, they told the
shareholders that things were wretchedly bad, and that
the managements would have to keep their nose to the
grindstone for years in order to pull things through.
Starting off on that basis nobody was surprised when
divs. were not paid, and when they did start again share-
holders were grateful even for small ones. And mean-
time, knowing that a return of the public’s full confidence
was what they needed more than anything else, this and
other Queensland banks adopted 'a policy of great
caution. Even now, when it can say that it is
pretty well out of the wood, this bank has 48
per cent, of its liabilities represented by liquid
assets ; and it has not got even the full amount of
its deposits let out in shrinkable advances. If the
advances were only worth 12s. in the £ it could still pay
all its debts. This is a very strong position, and it ought
to secure the confidence which the bank evidently aims
at getting ; and it knows that when a bank gets that,
prosperity and fat dividends are within reach.
But with this policy one has to wait for the fat
dividends. So far the results have been rather poor.
Profits calculated on capital and reserves have lately
been :
Dec., 1905 .. £3 15 7 p.c. Dec., 1907 .. £4 12 7 p.c.
June, 1906 .. 316 4 „ Sept., 1908 .. 411 9 ~
Dec., 1906 ~ 4 211 ~ Mar., 1909 .. 4 9 6,,
June, 1907 .. 4 5 6,, Sept., 1909 .. 4 8 3 „
It is possible, of course, that more or less profit has been
made which has not been disclosed—profit which has
gone to write down over-valued assets ; in other words,
undisclosed profits may have been used to writeoff old un-
disclosed losses. How much more of this there is to do
isn’t made known ; but, accepting the accounts as merely
a general indication of the trend of things, it may appa-
rently be taken for granted that, in the opinion of the
management, things are steadily improving. Re-
cently either it has been much easier for the
bank to get deposits, or it has pursued them
more energetically. Anyway, it has largely increased
its holding. As for instance: —

But the advances have actually shrunk—a rather remark-
able thing; in view of the progress Queensland is making.
It is pretty clear that the Royal of the North reckons it
has made enough losses for one short lifetime ; and it
sniffs a risk now at a very great distance. But that sort
of thing can be carried too far. It is all right to make
sure that you are not taking the wrong vehicle ; but there
is such a thing as missing the right 'bus through hesi-
tating too long on the sidewalk.

There are no flies in this beer. All that has any similarity
to a fly is an insect that floats on the top of the assets
side of the balance-sheet—a small insect labelled “Good-
will.” Nobody who only knows what the published
accounts tell him knows the exact size of this insect; but
the chances are that he isn’t at all prodigious. The
directors have, in fact, obviously done so much hard
writing down that it is almost inconceivable that they
have neglected this item; and it is probable that it is
kept there largely for exhibition purposes—just to sug-
gest to the Cold Tea campaigner that beer profits are not
so gaudy as some people think, and that it takes many,
many weary years for even a very successful beer co. to
wipe out the paper asset with which it started. At any
rate, even though the goodwill insect is still there, this
table shows how liquid assets have accumulated in the
past nine years :
Sept., 1900. Sept., 1909.
Liquid assets ..£127,453 £312,916 Inc. £185,463
Stock .. .. 51,582 138,444 Inc. 86,862
Book debts.. .. 210,037 190,009 Dec. 20,028

Less debts to public 10,938 23,195 Inc. 12,257
£378,134 £618,174 Inc. £240,040
So, besides paying its dividend, and paying for any new
plant and properties that it may have acquired, the co.
in nine years has put by the comfortable little lot of
£240,040. Nominally, it is true, “properties, goodwill
and plant” don’t stand for as much as they did in 1900.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the co. owns less
properties and plant; it may only mean that it has used
profits to write them down to cover depreciation, etc.
Some of this writing-down is admitted ; the usual thing
is £5OOO a half-year, but that is only for plant and ma-
chinery. Various items have moved as follows this cen-
tury
1900. 1908. 1909.

Now, “ the necessity for extensions in order to cope with
the increasing demand for Australian beer has had the
consideration of the directors for some time past; they
therefore have acquired a large area of land in the close
vicinity of the Kent brewery, upon which new buildings
are in course of erection. These will be fitted with a
duplicate plant and utilised without delay.” Evidently
the directors don’t take a gloomy view of the beer out-
look. Still, though the beer outlook may not be gloomy,
it is highly probable that the number of licensed premises
will go on shrinking ; and that will mean more depre-
ciation and more writing-down. Apart from that general
brewery risk, this co.’s position is, to all appearances, re-
markably sound.

When they are not counting up hogsheads the people re-
sponsible for these accounts are evidently studying' the
Old Scripture, and they frame their subsequent remarks
on the model of the stories of Jonah’s fish and Lot’s lady,
which are not to be taken too literally. For many years
the alleged profits maintained a miraculous uniformity ;
but a few years ago they gave up that habit. Apparently
they are throughout to be taken merely as a hint. In
that case it seems (1) that there is a great deal of
writing off to be done ; (2) that in 1906 trade im-
proved very much, and was even better the next year,
but has now eased off considerably. How much more
writing off has to be done can’t be even guessed at. The
co., which began by paying far too much for goodwill,
subsequently paid far too much for properties ; but how
much goodwill stands for isn’t mentioned—these direc-
tors have the lumping disease pretty badly. Still in the
past nine years £24,000 has been written off out of pro-
fits ; and that ought to mean that £24,000 of cash or
substantial assets has taken the place of paper, or it may
be that £24,000 of debt has been paid off. In either
case the co. ought to be (say) £llOO a year better off than
it was 10 years ago. So far as they are itemised, the past
year’s accounts compare with some of their predecessors
like this:—

Expenses (including pro-
vision for bad debts) .. 48,623 39,618 36,389
Considerable purchases of property or plant or both have
been made during the year ; but fortunately this has
been managed practically without increasing the debt
owing to the public, which isn’t now very large, though
it might be smaller. Ttie capital is £250,000 and the
resen es are supposed to be £49,332. The return of only
4 per cent, suggests that there not only are no reserves
at all, but that there is a big hole in the capital. If the
reserves were written off and the shares were written
down to 155., £111,832 could come off the assets; and
even that would allow for writing down all shrinkable
assets by one-third. If more than that has to be written
off, then the co. had better give up the idea of writing it
off out of profits, and instead proceed to clean things up
by writing off reserves and readjusting the capital
account.

The foregoing table shows the proceedings of the society
since the cleaning-up. At that time the assets were
worth £180,876, according to the books. According to a
new valuation, however, they were only worth £118,151.
The capital was therefore written down. To simplify
matters, two-fifths of it was wiped out, which, after writ-
ing down the assets, left £10,532 over to go to a con-
tingency fund to provide for repairs, further losses on
sales, etc. The valuators took a gloomy view of the situ-
ation, as it turns out; and, instead of there being further
losses, some of the written-off capital has been
coming back in the shape of profits on sales. This,
of course, has swollen the current profits, and has made
the history of the last few years look better than it really
has been—assuming that the full current profits from
other sources have been stated. The fact that the profit
on sales always nowadays comes out at round figures
suggests that the society is holding some sort of inner
reserve, upon which it is drawing ; but what the size of
this reserve may be there is no telling from the accounts.
As properties have been realised advances have been
made, as the following comparison shows :
1899. 1907. 1908. 1909.
Capital .. ..£98,150 £97,523 £96,387 £96,361
Deposits .. .. 2,997 21,936 22,427 22,644

Advances .. .. 40,510 127,952 138,271 138,408
Other assets .. 5,172 1,329 258 1,720
The rents from properties in possession totalled £3900 ;
and as that is equal to about llj per cent, on the average
book value of the properties held during the year, it is
pretty clear that the book value is exceedingly low ; and
further surpluses may be expected from sales. But those
surpluses can’t go on for ever; more than half the fore-
closures have already been got rid of. Further, as the pro-
perties are sold, more and more of the- beautiful 114 per
cent, return disappears. At the same time it is worth noting
that never since 1899 has the dividend absorbed the whole
of the profit from ordinary business, so that the whole of
the surpluses from sales, and more, has gone to reserves.
The advances are a profitable lot also, bringing in over
8 percent, as an average; but no accounts have yet been
invented which can tell what proportion of the securities
that are lodged against advances will fall into the mort-
gagees’ hands, and what losses will be made over them.
As the figures stand they are all very enticing ; it doesn’t
often happen that a co. can show such results unless it
takes on much heavier liabilities than this co. is doing.
For the total debts of all kinds are equal to only a shade
over one-half of the capital.

The original concern was the Newcastle Permanent In-
vestment and Building Society. In 1895 it viewed its
assets and found that they were mostly foreclosed proper-
ties, and that the building society part of the business had
dropped down an abandoned shaft somewhere. So the
next year this building and investment co. was formed.
The assets were re-valued, and on that re-valuation a large
proportion of the capital was turned over to a contingency
fund, which was designed to fill up the gap between the
book values of properties and the prices they would prob-
ably bring. Ten years ago the foreclosures (book value)
were £108,576; the contingency fund at that time was
£47,222. The foreclosures stand now at £61,090, and the
contingency fund is £40,413. So £47,486 of properties,
plus any that may have fallen in meantime, have been
got rid of at a loss of £6809, which is a long way better
than had been provided for, assuming; that what has been
got rid of is a fair sample of the whole. As the old pro-
perties have been realised others have been bought; and
the position now compares with the past like this :
1899. 1907. 1908. 1909.
Deposits .. £21,373 £9,683 £12,893 £18,622
Other debts .. 549 276 588 299
Advances .. 36,836 20,142 26,585 40,816
Foreclosures .. 108,576 66,785 64,729 61,090
Other property 5,682 52,684 53,732 54,057
Liquid assets .. 9,761 8,707 7,016 2,001
Lately, it will be noticed, the advance business has in-
creased considerably ; part of this is most likely in con-
nection with properties sold on terms. The properties,
including foreclosures, during the past year brought in
£6453, or a shade over 01 per cent., after paying rates
and repairs. Judging by that, one wouldn’t say
that the foreclosures in hand were very seriously
overvalued ; if they are, the other properties must be a
very profitable lot. The strength of the co. lies in the
fact that the capital of the old society was written down
very severely, and a great deal of it which was transferred
to the contingency fund was not lost, after all; so that
what appeared to be the exceedingly doubtful reserves
with which the co. started look now as if they were to a
great extent genuine reserves. There is an insect in the
ointment, no doubt; though it is a port, Newcastle is
also a mining centre, and the property and rent values in
even the best of mining centres are liable to severe bumps.

along- with the East Greta railway ; and the railway is a
tidy little asset in itself. It will be noticed that the half-
year’s dividend and the amount written off absorb every
pound of the half-year’s profit, leaving nothing whatever
for reserves. Under ordinary circumstances that wouldn’t
look good. But there is some sort of suspicion that this
co.’s accounts might be made to look better if the
directors felt that way. Thus £1630 is shown as written
off-—£lsoo off plant and £l3O off house property. But
£3421 is already written off for depreciation of plant,
etc., and charged direct to profit and loss; and the
same thing has been going on for some years. Con-
sidering that the co. is maintaining a big output
of coal, and that the coal which has been dug out once
can’t be dug out twice, a solid allowance for depreciation
is no doubt called for. Probably thisco. doesn’t write oft
too much. But it is certain lhat a good many other cos.
write off much less. The co. now shows for the first time
an issue of £28,000 worth of debentures. Apparently
these have been issued to secure an overdraft; and the
small additions that have been made lately to the liabili-
ties have probably been due to the extension of the rail-
way. Additions to the mine plant, etc., have been mostly
paid for out of profits which have been written off against
depreciation. The financial position on Sept. 30 was that
the co. owed £44,963, while its liquid assets (including
stores and coal in transit) totalled £35,512. It is a case in
which the position is only seen indistinctly through a
heavy fog ; but there is very little doubt that, besides
having two of the best coal properties in the Maitland
district, the co. has a money-spinner in its railway, while
its surface rights are increasing in value.

This co. has had a lot worse luck than it deserved. It
started with too little capital—because it couldn’t get
more at the time—and when it simply had to get more
the money had to be bought. Still the issue of 20,844 £1
pref. shares has cleared away a lot of debt ; and on
September 30 the co. owed only £2500 on debentures,
plus £4964 on overdraft. When the coal trade was brisk
the co. had a fire on hand and had to seal up part of the
mine ; and that has always been more or less of a trouble
since. Now, when the mine could stand a good output,
the market is slack ; and that means broken time and
high costs. The co.’s neighbor works what is known as
the East Greta lower seam, a fine 12ft. body. To reach
this seam this co. has been boring off and on for 18
months, but can’t strike it; it got sandstone below the
top seam, but it can’t get the lower seam. Apart from
anything spent on development, and charged up to
capital account, recent resu ts have been :
Mar., 1906 .. Loss £132 Mar., 1908 .. Prof. £BB6
5ept.,1906.. Prof. 144 5ept.,1908.. ~ 2245
Mar., 1907 .. Loss 376 Mar., 1909 .. Loss 583
Sept., 1907.. Prof. 1867 Sept., 1909.. „ 1220
The position, therefore, is that after working about seven
years, and taking out about £160,000 worth of coal, the
co. has put £16,765 more into the mine, to meet working
expenses, than it has taken out of it; and nothing what-
ever has been written off for depreciation, notwithstanding
the extraction of all this mineral. Also £25,821 has been
put into plant, and nothing has been written off that for
depreciation either. If the co. could find a big lower seam
the development and plant might be worth the money ;
if the big lower seam can’t be found, and the life of the
mine is therefore much more limited, the cost of develop-
ment and plant ought to be written off much more
rapidly, and they are in that case already worth a good
deal less than they have cost the co. Coal shares are put
in the investment section on the stock lists ; but this is a
case where the future is as uncertain as that of almost
any copper mine.
* • * *
Just when metal people were saying that
Christmas would see lead at £l4, and that the worst of
the copper situation had been passed, the Bank of Eng-
land rate went up rapidly to 5 per cent., and the German
rate had previously firmed. That meant much dearer
money, and a bigger cost to finance stocks of metal or
anything else ; and the markets of all kinds promptly
sagged. The Broken Hill market had got the bit in its
teeth and was bolting ; and this steadier will give people
time to wonder what sort of fools they were beginning to
make of themselves. So far the zinc convention has
managed to keep up the price of spelter. If that market
should fail, there would be a frightful clatter.

The reconstruction of the Australian News-
paper Co. (Sydney), the publisher of the Star and the
Sunday Sun, is under weigh. The original co. was in
40,000 shares. When that capital was all absorbed, 12,500
preference shares were issued ; and on June 30 last,
£16,079 was also secured to the bank and other creditors
by debentures. The proposal now is to form a co. in
100,000 shares as follows
To holders of ordinaries .. ~ ~ 16,000
To holders of pref. shares 10,000
To the public 34,000

The Callow Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
fine wet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to be screened.
The machine is fully protected by patent rights. For
further particulars apply to the Austral Otis Engineering
Co., of Hanna Street, South Melbourne. This firm are the

That would mean that ordinaries would get two shares
for every five now held, and prefs. would get four for
every five now held. If the scheme goes through, the new
issue of 34,000 shares will carry a 6 per cent, preference,
and will rank with the ordinaries for any dividend pay-
able in excess of 6 per cent. They will be preferent as to
capital as well as to dividends; and in view of the niuch-
improved prospects of the two papers they should be

There are only two States now which have more
than one Savings Bank —Tasmania and N. S. Wales. All
the other States have one apiece. During the last few
months a system of inter-State transfers was arranged
which enables depositors to pass money from one
State to another. Only Tasmania is barred from this
arrangement. In N. S. Wales it can be done through the
Government Savings Bank, but not through what is
known as the “ Barrack-street Bank ” —the Savings Bank
of N. S. Wales: the bank which the State ought to take
over, seeing that it would admittedly be expected to go
to its rescue if anything happened, just as it had to go m
George Dibbs’s davs. No doubt the fact that the other
N.S.W. bank—the'State Bank—has fixed up a treaty of
reciprocity with the savings banks of the other States
will turn depositors towards it; and that may presently
bring the “ Barrack-street Bank ” to its bearings.

Silver keeps at a low price, and Australian lead
and copper mines help to supply a reason—a vast quan-
tity of the white metal is now produced as a by -product.
During 12 months, Chillagoe sent away 756,0000 z. silver,
contained in 6763 tons lead and 2966 tons copper, or
rather more than 80oz. per ton of base metal. Mount
Lyell in 12 months sends away, approximately, 640,0000 z.
silver, contained in 8400 tons copper. The last monthly
production was 655 tons copper, containing 53,8040 z.,
which gave the rather unusual return of 82oz. per ton.
Hitherto Broken Hill has only recovered about half the
silver in concentrating the crude ore to a payable grade
for the lead smelter to handle; but now the zinc works
are recovering much of that metal, which has been
accumulating on the tailings dumps. Looking at the
world’s production of silver, it seems probable that the
average silver contents in base metal in America is even
more than it is here.

Broken Hill Junction North had £6770 to credit
of profit and loss account six months ago, and the total is
now £16,002; so, after writing £7589 off plant to cover
depreciation, theco. is £9232 to the good on the half-year.
The amount written off in the 12 months is equal to 15
per cent., which looks a lot, but is not excessive. So far
as the mill plant is concerned, 20 per cent, isn’t too much
to wipe out every year ; for, especially when working on
stuff like the Junction North’s rhodonite ore, the life of
some of the parts only runs to months, instead of years.
If the co. could reach the end of its capital expenditure
it would promptly pay fairly solid divs. But the call for
new plant, or for the remodelling of the old plant, has
been incessant. Therefore, though a net profit of £9232
is shown for the past half-year, the co.’s finances are not
that much forrarder. The position on March 31 was :
Liquid assets. —Concentrates .. £7,604
Sundry debtors .. 5,113
Cash balances .. 2,763
Total .. £15,480
Liabilities.—Sundry creditors ~ 8,247
Surplus liquid assets .. £7,233
And on Sept. 30 the position was:—
Liquid assets. —Concentrates .. £3,654
Sundry debtors .. 11,950
Cash balances .. 9,121
Total .. .. £24,725
Liabilities.—Sundry creditors .. 8,891
Surplus liquid assets.. £15,834
That is a distinct improvement : after paying for plant
alterations or renewals and some additions, the co. is
thus £B6Ol to the good, whereas in the previous half-
year, though a net profit of £9752 was shown, the finances
went £2651 to the bad. As remarked just now, almost
everything depends on the amount which the co. feels
called on to spend on plant. If it can keep the total
down to about £7500 a half-year, then, on the last six
months’ experiences, and even with the past six months’
low prices, there is an easy shilling a share (£9000) per
half-year ; and every £1 over £l3 ior lead is worth another
9d. per share.

The De Bavay zinc people have called in
Bewick, Moreing and Co. to report on their probable
profits. It is a curious position, because 8., M. and Co.
are general managers of the Zinc Corporation, the other
big Broken Hill zinc concern. However, neither of them
love the Sulphide Corporation, which is some sort of a
bond ; and on account of the European Zinc Convention
there isn’t much rivalry between zinc producers anyhow.
By about April next the De Bavay Co. expects to be
handling at the rate of 300,000 tons of zinc tailings per
annum ; and the output is expected to reach 100,000 tons
of spelter concentrates, worth at least 40per cent. Upon an
output of from 90,000 tons to 100,000 tons 8., M. and Co.
estimate a profit of from £109,000 to £120,000, taking
spelter at £2l. At £22 the profit should, they say, be
from £123,000 to £136,000.
If there is this profit in it for the De Bavay Co.,
the outlook is pleasant for the B. H. South Co. The
South is to supply the De Bavay Co. with most of its
tailings ; and the South must get the same amount as the
De Bavay makes in profit. First the South gets 3s. 6d.
per ton ; then the De Bavay Co. pays its costs out of the
proceeds ; then it pays itself 3s. 6d. per ton of tailings;
and the balance it whacks with the South Co. So each
co. puts precisely the same amount into its pouch, so far,
of course, as the South’s tailings are concerned.
Whether spelter can be kept at or past £2l is
another matter. In 1895 it was down as low as £l4 155.;
even last year it touched £l7 17s. 6d. The Zinc Conven-
tion may work wonders. But it would be a lot easier for
a combine to work wonders if there wasn’t this huge out-
put of new metal coming on to the market.
» * * *
The acid-oil flotation process, which is respon-
sible for all this new output of zinc, has hitherto been
applicable only to certain classes of ore ; but the experi-
ments of E. J. Horwood, the B. H. Prop.'s Broken Hill
manager, promise to sweep in much more material.
Hitherto his tests have been in the laboratory ; but bulk
parcels of Broken Hill slimes and complex Tasmanian
sulphides have been sent to Bendigo School of Mines for
treatment by the Horwood method. On Tuesday
word came from there that from both of these
materials a high-grade zinc concentrate was being
won, with a satisfactory extraction. If costs are
all right this will be very good news for the B. H. Prop,
(vvhich has the slimes nuisances on a large scale), and
probably better news still for the West Coast of Tas-
mania. And the silver-lead-zinc section of the West
Coast of Tasmania wants all the good news it can get
just now.
The Commonwealth Oil Corporation is said to
have secured its new plaster of £300,000 of 6 per cent,
convertible debenture stock, and the prospectus of the
new issue has reached The Bulletin. The 0.0.0.’s
capital is now thus:
Preferred ordinary shares .. .. £500,000
Deferred ordinary shares .. .. 225,007
First debentures 150,000
6 per cent, convertible debentures.. 300,000
Total £1,175,007
At present £lOO,OOO 6 per cent, convertible debentures
and £74,993 deferred ordinary shares are reserved. Of
the £836,324 of capital already expended £321,483 is
debited to original properties at cost, and £92,422 for the
concern of the N.S.VV. Shale and Oil Co., which was
probably not worth anything like that mone3'. The
balance (£422,419) has been spent on works and develop-
ment as follows:
Development, prospecting and surveying .. £71,271
Plant and machinery; buildings, stores, main-
tenance, etc 67,892
Kailway and rolling stock .. .. .. 169,603
Applied to the general purposes of the c 0.... 113,653
Total £422,419
Nothing could be more magnificent than the fine
and haughty way the appropriations of these large
amounts are lumped together. The £113,653 “ applied
to the general purposes of the co.” are as mysterious as
the fate of the Waratah.
The second mortgage issue is a dear one too :
£260,000 of the £300,000 has been underwritten at 5J per
cent, commission, and the underwriters have a call on
deferred ordinaries at par to the extent of 30 per cent, of
their underwriting. So £16,500 goes in commissions
alone ; and as the new stock bears 6 per cent, interest,
the 0.0. C. cannot be too cheerfully regarded even by
the people who are so deeply in it that they must either
smile and part up or die.

There is a very restless feeling|among Newcastle
(N.S. W.) coal miners just now ; and anything may happen
before long. The miners always have enough grievances
to hang a strike on ; and, whether a strike happens or not
is therefore mainly a matter of the local feeling, or temper,
or whatever you like to call it. Just at present, the temper
is such that a very little would cause trouble ; but a
decision to maintain the present 11s. a ton selling rate
for another year will go a long way towards averting it.
The owners’ federation now has that matter under con-
sideration ; and a change from the present price isn’t
likely.

Vegetable Creek, the New England (N.S.W.)
deep-lead tin show in which Adelaide is interested, has
had a disappointment; the shaft didn’t bottom on wash.
They must now drive for the gutter, which of course
wouldn’t be a serious matter if the co. could .be quite sure
that its shaft is good enough to stand much racketing.
But it can’t be at all sure of that.

Main Ridge Deep Lead, Rockley (N.S.W.), is
developing a run of cement wash covered with basalt.
Drives into the hill have opened up a run of about 100 ft.
of washdirt. The cement is generally about 2ft. thick,
and dish prospects are said to show from Sdwt. to lOdwt.
to the load. The ridge should pay all right if it has 2ft.
of joz. dirt for any considerable distance.

J. E. Carne, assistant Government Geologist
(N.S.W.), has been out West looking at the Euriowie and
Waukaroo tinflelds ; but he doesn’t think much of them.
The shoots are too short and irregular. The one property
in whose favor he is inclined to make an exception is the
Kantappa.
The Harden (N.S.W.) will be worth watching .
for a few weeks. During the last day or two the lode has
been tapped in the crosscut from the bottom level
(600 ft.). So far nothing is known about it except that
the drill borings show it, where tapped, to be very poor,
worth only ss. per ton. (Holes were kept ahead of the
working face, because a heavy flow of water was ex-
pected.) On the data obtained from the upper levels
payable ore was not looked for at the point where
the crosscut was planned to strike the lode :
and a drive east will be put in at once in search of the
shoot of richer stone. The result of this driving will be
of much importance, because ore from this level will
before many months be relied upon to supply the new
mill, which has just been given a successful trial run. If
things don’t turn out as well as they should at 600 ft,,
another crosscut and drive will be put in at 720 ft.; the
shaft is already deep enough for that, purpose. As, hovv-
ever, the lode has been picked up within 18in. of where it
was expected at 600 ft., there is more reason than ever to
expect that the pay shoot will also be picked up by driv-
ing east at that level just as it has been at the levels above.

Cheerful excerpt from Treasurer’s Moore’s
budget speech (VV.A.): “Developments have shown that
our mines live and retain high values at depth. Many of
the old districts which previously seemed abandoned
have shown renewed activity, and many new discoveries
have been made which considerably enlarge our known
auriferous belt. ... I have previously quoted a few of the
ore reserves of several of our mines, and I think I am
justified in again drawing attention to the wealth and the
prosperity of certain holdings, omitting for obvious
reasons the names of the companies. No. 1 has an ore
reserve of 731,426 tons, being seven years’ supply at the
present rate of output, and is estimated to contain
£2,500,000 worth of gold. No. 2 has a reserve of
510,000 tons, being four years’ supply, and estimated
to contain £1,055,409 worth of gold. No. 3 has
a reserve of 430,414 tons, being four years’ supply, and
estimated to contain 10‘21dwt. of gold per ton. No. 4
has a reserve of 1,055,409 tons, being four years’ supply,
and estimated to contain £2,500,000 worth of gold.
These figures, combined with the fact that, although
only a young mining country, lodes of value and width
have been located at over 2300 ft. deep, speak volumes.”
No doubt they do ; but why not go further and squarely
face the fact that without these four mines, which are
getting poorer and not richer, the industry would look
very sickly? Also, why throw so much limelight on the
alleged renewed activity in mining, and keep in the
pitch-dark background the fact that, despite the “ new
discoveries” and the enlargement of “the auriferous
belt,” etc., the gold yield is steadily decreasing? It is
this refusal to squarely face facts which has led to
Westralia having had six deficits in succession.

The options held by 8., M. and Co. over the
Frasers group of mines at Southern Cross (W.A.) are for
the London and Australian Exploration Co. Some dia-
mond drilling and other prospecting is to be done, and if
sufficient inducement offers, it is intended to equip and
work the properties on a big low-grade scale. In addition
to these and other options, the Exploration Co. holds
big interests in the Lancefield and Northern mines,
and it also has a big block of Great Fitzroy shares.

The prospect of Boulder Main Reef (W.A.)
getting the extension of the Boulder shoot at 3000 ft. has
more than once been viewed with doubt on this page, and
now the local paper sorrowfully admits that, as the work
done in the present bottom level (2350 ft.) shows that the
shoot makes no attempt to bridge the 1000 ft. or so
between the present end of payable values and the
“Reef’s” boundary, the chance of the latter property
getting the shoot at the depth mentioned isn’t enhanced.
In view of this admission it looks as if an amalgamation
with Chaffers is the only thing that will save the co.,
as it won’t be an easy matter to coax shareholders to
respond to a further assessment sufficient to pay off Lionel
Robinson’s mortgage of £7OOO and provide enough work-
ing capital to go deeper.
* * * *
Lewis Aarons is in the West busy fixing up the
amalgamation of Chaffers and the Boulder Main Reef.
The idea is that the new Chaffers Co. should be in
750,000 shares, of which the main reef should take two
for every three now held, and the balance of 141,000
should be held in reserve, and passed out as money is
wanted. The cheerful feature about Aarons’ scheme is
that he doesn’t propose to assess the present shareholders.
“Pindan”: Out beyond Menzies and Davy-
hurst, in the North Coolgardie district (W.A.), several
big parcels of stone have been treated for 15, 17 and
18dwt. respectively. One lot of 400 tons, crushed at a
State battery, returned a clear profit of £750. This rep-
resented the work of four men for eight,weeks. Yet the
show was rejected after being under option for several
months. Of course, working miners have no guinea pigs
to support, neither have they a horde of experts, clerks
and typists on the premises. At Meekatharra, Sand-
stone, Magnet and all over the Westralian fields, pro-
spectors no longer chase after the company shark and the
promoter of syndicates with pocket-worn specimens, but
set to work with pick and gad. The State batteries
enable them to prove the actual value of their shows
without all the fanciful assays and other frillings of the
professional brass-plated crowd who control so many of
the big mines throughout Australia. For the courageous
prospector, with pluck and some experience of mulga and
spinifex life, there is no finer field than Westralia. Divi-
dends may fall off so far as the big mines are concerned,
but the actual workers will probably go on getting more
and more.

Stannary Hills (Q.), which reconstructed in
October, 1908, issues accounts for the period to the end
of July. The nine months have been spent mainly in
getting things ready for a fresh start. A new shaft had
to be sunk at the Ivanhoe, the mill had to be recon-
structed, and other big work done. Exclusive of £2165
spent on the new shaft, and other amounts charged up to
capital, the expenditure was £18,052 more than the
receipts. Interest is a heavy item ; and the company’s
Oohen looks in regularly, whether the mill is producing
or not. The bill for the nine months was £4453.
The trouble consists of £7470 of 10 per cent,
debenture stock, £63,850 of 6 per cent, ditto, and
£14,416 of loans; besides that the co. owed
£4870 on July 31. There are 650,000 shares, but they
have been written down to 2s. 6d., of which 6d. has not
yet been called up. Of the shares 100,000 are preference.
Even though the new mill should earn a profit of £2500
per month—and that is about the most sanguine estimate
yet made—there is a lot to do before shareholders, and
especially holders of ordinaries, can get a bit. They may,
no doubt, come in before the debentures are all paid off ;
but the 10 per cents, will surely be wiped out first, and
then a sinking fund will be called for on the balance. The
future certainly isn’t as black as it was once; but
whether the shareholders will ever get their money back
is still by no means certain. Besides the mine the co.
has an asset in the train way, which has been written down
to £50,529 ; but in the nine months there was only a
balance of £34 on the tramway account, after crediting it
with £607 for company’s own traffic, and without debit-
ing any interest to it.
The 0.K., in North Queensland, has now a
strike on hand ; or if it isn’t a strike it’s a lockout. The
men wanted a little more to come their way; and
the co. thereupon paid off all hands. Looked at from the
shareholders’ point of view, the smelter should have been
shut down long ago ; but it doesn’t suit anybody’s book
to have the mine closed down also.

New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers, will
have its new air-compressor at work shortly, and develop-
ment work should then be quicker, and the output larger.
The extension of No. 2 east towards the Brilliant boundary
is a bit of interesting prospecting. There is a slide or
crosscourse somewhere ahead of No. 2 level; but it is
argued by the hopeful punter that, because the Brilliant
reef made again on the western side of the slide, the Day
Dawn has also a good chance of struggling to life again on
the eastern side, in the Brilliant P.C., or (at a deeper
level) in the Brilliant Block. Nevertheless, Charters
Towers is looking rather anxiously at the little quartz
vein called a Day Dawn as it comes along eastward. For
though it is quite true that the Brilliant reef did make
again after the slide came in, the Freehold was never able
to pay a dividend out of it.
« • * *
East Mexican, Charters Towers, has fixed up
its little difficulty about boundary rights with its neigh-
bor, the New Brilliant Freehold, and is by this time proba-
bly busy breaking down some of the good stone left at the
end of No. 6 level. Nobody knows how far this body of
stone will keep parallel to the boundary, which runs east
and west, because the reef has sometimes a slight trend
north of east. Still the prospect of getting another good
crushing has put more hope into this venture.
* * * *
Pfeiffer’s Day Dawn has had a good breaking
down at No. 9 footwall level, and hopes are held out that
the stone will extend upwards towards the winze from
No. 4, which also located good stone. Simultaneous dis-
coveries on the footwall reef gave Pfeiffer’s a good rise in
front of a 3d. call. Prospects have been indifferent on
both hanging wall and footwall sections of this reef ; but
another deep level is about to be explored, and as the
stone in both reefs carries mineral, there is certainly some-
thing to gamble on.

According to a report furnished by the Queens-
land Mines Department, 379,650 tons of ore were smelted
within the State last year, and only 21,004 tons were ex-
ported. The latter included 11,000 tons gold concen-
trates, 4500 tons copper ore, and 2000 tons lead ore.
Smelting and realisation charges eat a big hole in the
cake, even after the ore has been put on a railway truck
or planked down on the wharf. With total deductions
amounting to from £6 to £8 per ton, there is mighty little
chance of a big export trade in crude ore and concen-
trates, because the ore has to be phenomenally rich to
Stand such heavy costs. Results seem to be about the
same whether ore is sent to a local smelter or exported to
'N.S.W. or Europe; but deductions vary with the state
of the metal market and with the quantity of zinc or
arsenic in the stuff. One curious feature of Queensland’s
trade in minerals is that Stannary Hills sends its black
tjn concentrates to Singapore, in the Malay States. An
export tax on black tin from Singapore has helped the
lbcal tin smelter, so the Chow capitalist is able to import
Queensland tin ore, although right at Stannary’s back
door the Irvinebank tin smelter is in full blast, and the
quality of Australian tin is so good that it commands a
premium. # # *
Long Tunnel (Vic.) on September 30 stood like
this: Liquid assets, £17,476, apart from percentages held
back on mining contracts, etc. ; liabilities, £1489 ; sur-
plus, £15,987. Out of that a dividend of Is. was paid this
month—£l2oo. The half-year’s profits were £3441, of
which £3OO went as a final subsidy to the Moe-Walhalla
railway. The co. is already getting some benefit from
this work ; and the line will be finished right through by
the end of the year. Of the liquid assets, £14,000 is
bottled up in the reserve fund ; and in view of the look
of things in the bottom levels, the shareholders probably
feel pleased now that the directors had the pluck to hang
on to that much.

The Vic. Government has decided to go straight
ahead with the Bill authorising it to do everything and
anything that may be necessary to enable it to work a
State coal mine on the new Powlett River field. The State
ishanging on to 20 square milesof thatcoalcountryforits
own purposes, and, unless the experts’ arithmetic is all
out, there are 30,000,000 tons in that little lot. And
there is room for S. Australia, too, the Victorian
Government remarks. S. Aus. had an idea of spend-
ing about £200,000 in opening up a mine on the Maitland
field (N.S.W.); the Victorian Government suggests that
it should come in at Powlett, where the sinking is, say,
only 400 ft., as against 1400 ft. at East Maitland, and the
train haulage only about 11 miles. The royalty men-
tioned is from 2d. to Is. per ton. The Victorian Govern-
ment wants about 400,000 tons a year for its railways,
etc. ; Si Aus. wants about 160,000 tons for its railways ;
and its tramways and other public services could take
another 150,000 tons or more.

From an ex-Australian in S’Africa: “J. C.
Watson is understood to have secured a dredging claim
on the Limpopo River, 100 miles from Petersburg, in a
wild and almost inaccessible part of the country. He
acquired this proposition from a syndicate in Durban.
This syndicate never saw the show itself, but sent an
honest man to work it with niggers; and after four
months’ trial and the recovery of 7oz. of gold at a cost of
about £2OO, the man got disgusted and threw the job up.
Some members of the syndicate tried to unload shares in
town (Durban), but the public sniffed, and passed. The
sluicing claim is known as the Thabina mynpacht. I
can’t imagine how Mr. Watson came to purchase this
show, for there are far better ones obtainable by anyone
who wishes to peg a mynpacht for 100 miles above this
ground on the Limpopo River.” Still, before the Aus-
tralian public will be asked to speak it will have a report
from P. N. Tewksbury; and he probably knows more
about dredging ground than even the honest gentleman
who worked it for the Jew syndicate.

The Blythe River Iron Mines, Ltd., which owns
a splendid deposit of iron on the Tasmanian coast, is still
busy doing nothing. The idea originally was to put up
furnaces and other mill plant near Sydney, but the idea
has been hung up for nine years. “ There is very little
to say,” the directors report, “as we are still waiting
until a favorable opportunity arises for taking decisive
action.” The co., which is in 500,000 shares, nearly all of
them issued to the old syndicate which owned the pro-
perty, still has £5071 in hand ; and the interest on that
amount pays about half the expenses.

WHEN THE HAIR FALLS OUT—
You probably do not begin to worry about it at once.
It is only after you have noticed that it has o-rowri
appreciably thinner that you think it is high time that
something must be done to correct the trouble.
Have you tried many advertised remedies without food
results ? Nearly everybody has. Those so-called cure-all
remedies are useless, sometimes even injurious ; and you
need individual treatment, not necessarily expensive.
This is an extract from one patient’s letter :
“I have finished the preparations for my hair. Since
using them, two months only, my hair has improved
considerably in every way. It has grown two inches
longer, and has now a splendid gloss.' Also, it has got
much thicker.”—G. D. Denman.

Robur! Robur!! Robur!!!

A
WOMEN’S
LETTERS
Sydney, October 26, 1909.
My Dear Arint,—
“Lend us your aid,” said the women of Sydney
to visiting High Churchman Woolcombe, and he
replied in effect, “Lend me your ears.” And
behold the Women Society, political and working,
went forth to the Sydney Town Hall and lent
all its ears as commanded. It hasted in mul-
titudes to hear the counsel of the prophet;
with its enchantments and the sorceries that it had
practised from its youth, it hurried, saying, “I
am, and none else beside me.” Many were dis-
mayed, especially the mothers of the more youthful
virgins, for word had gone forth from the pub-
lishers to the populace that no man save he that
was to speak should pass within lest he be turned
back greatly ashamed. As the Biblical style is a
little trying to one used to plain Australian, I will
now drop it and proceed to assurances that men
and youths might have been present at the
address without the faintest embarrassment to
themselves or their feminines.
Lady Chelmsford introduced "My friend, Mr.
Woolcombe,” in a few well-chosen cooings, and
then sank into a velvet chair facing the 3000-
odd audience. Behind, or flanking her, were
the Simpson lady, Mrs. Allen Taylor, Mrs.
H. H. Dangar, Mrs. Monty Severn, and
about a hundred other women of more
or less importance. If anyone really expected
an address beginning “My dear Sisters, let us
first consider the evils of tight-lacing, the doubt-
fulness of the decollete Direotoire, and the danger
of the moonlit, sequestered place,” she was dis-
appointed. Mr. Woolcombe has a voice that
annihilates distance—the distance inside the
Town Hall. He spoke a common-sense,
popular form of counsel—spoke it fervently
and with emphasis. The engaged girl might
induce her affianced one to turn his eyes
from the scratching board to eternity instead of
joining him in senseless frivolity. The enormous
influence of the woman . . . he quoted historical
instances. But the major portion of his exordium
was directed to mothers in relation to their sons.
The pathetic anecdote was frequent; so were the
tears it called forth. Ninety per cent, of the
audience was worker manual worker at
that, if appearance counted—so it took com-
placently the speaker’s entreaty not to continue
to lead “a butterfly existence.” The meal un-
shared was food unblest; they hoard in vain what
love should spend ; self-ease was pain ; their only
rest was labor for a worthy end. A toil that gains
with what it yields, and scatters to its own in-
crease, and hears while sowing outward fields the
harvest song of inward peace.
That’s the gist of what he said, only he didn’t
rhyme it. Then damsels took up a collection
amounting, in (mainly) threepenny bits, to
£55 15s. sd. Several yims were sung. Lady
Chelmsford drove off with her attendant lancer
clattering behind, Mrs. Mayoress Taylor honked
away in a dark-bodied car with red-running gear,
and the other “ butterflies ” flew their many ways.
I have heard a good many sermons in my time.
Most of them, I am bound to own, conveyed little
to me. They didn’t so much leave me cold as
puzzled. The normal cleric has a mystifying way
of flooding his subject with words and words and
then more words till the waters of obscurity rise
around it and hide it from the view of all who are
not inspired. This is the sort of spiritual good
cheer I have had handed out to me from a thousand
pulpits:—
Ah ! brethren, but the Lesson to be learned, the car-
dinal, heaven-sent Lesson, is that tiie Spirit is not so
much of the Word as the Word of the Spirit. How many
of us is accorded the grace to go away into the silences,
the lone, vast places of earth, and brood upon that mighty
thought? How many of us have what I may venture to
call the moral intrepidity to emulate the Forerunner,
and retire to the desert where the flesh-pots are not and
naught but locusts and frogs abide, there to cope unaided
with the legions of the Lost? Alas ! not many, I fear me
much, in these materialistic times. No, brethren, we
prefer the gay lights of the tea-shops, the tram-rides, the
visits to waxworks and picture shows ; and as we flutter
our little hour, like wayward moths around these the
candles of our desire, the great basic truths of the Gospel
are relegated to oblivion, and the Spirit which is of the
Word and yet is not the Word nor in any way connected
with the Word is suffered to mingle and commingle.
And so on. I have listened dazedly to reams and
reams of this sort of thing. I well-nigh burst my
intellect trying to resolve what it was all about,
and failed every time. Yet in pews all round me
were folk, no cleverer-looking than myself, who
raised their eyes and hands admiringly at the
finish and murmured “lovely,” “sweet” and
other words of praise.
Mr. Woolcombe is staying with the Chelmsfords
at Cranbrook, and is saving souls in bundles.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly organised a garden f§te last
week in aid of All Saints’ Church, Woollahra, and
it transpired on Wednesday, on the grounds of the
Glenyarrah home. On the same afternoon another
of these entertainments was raging at Llandilo,
Strathfield, the abiding-place of the Sydney
Joneses. It is assumed that the recrudescence of
the garden or lawn f6te idea had its origin in the
“ Belle of New York” revival, wherein it will be
remembered all hands finish up at one of these
revels. For hours Double Bay trams and Strath-
field trains bore away citizenesses (and here and
there a citizen) who looked more or less like
Queens of comic opera, Blinky Bills, Mamie
Clancys, and others whom we have come to re-
gard as typical lawn filters, and with them were
small, stout, exasperated children, and in the
children’s hands were clasped trumpets and toy
bears and so forth, the products of the stalls.
The Glenyarrah show realised over £lOO, and the
Llandilo one (it was in aid of the Queen Yic.
Home for Consumptives) a few pounds less.
What a horror the young bride of the present
day has for whiskerings ! King Alfonso of Spain,
while in Madrid during the recent troubles, grew
a luxuriant set of “side-levers ” —or, as Mr. Frank
Richardson, the prominent English whisker-
expert, has it, “ let-us-prays.” When thev had
bourgeoned to the full, he hastened to San
Sebastian and displayed his new possessions to
Queen Ena. She immediately covered her baby’s
eyes, rang for the infant’s attendant and had it re-
moved, and then opened outon her disfigured spouse
in such fashion that he tore in disorder to the bath-
room and mowed off every vestige of the herbage.
A few generations ago the humble little wife—the
one who sat fashioning samplers in anticipation of
the return of her lord—would have well-nigh
swooned with joy at the thought that he was to
bring home with him a full rich crop of whiskers.
Who does not recall the continual references of
heroines of fiction, about Thackeray’s time, to So
and So’s “divine,” “delicious” and “superb”
whiskers? Now any trace of face-grass renders
the young husband a by-word. Who shall explain
these things? Alfonso wanted to argue that it
tended to make him look “like an Admiral.”
“Like a butler,” said the Queen, acidly. It was
at this stage of the discussion that the King left
for the bathroom.
Dear smiling George Reid attends kirk not
quite so often as he might, but he is known to be
a son of, and sympathetic with, the Manse. So the
Moderator of the Presbyterian Assembly, noticing
him among the spectators the other day, cordially
invited him to step up and speak a piece. George
at once complied, but modestly, and as though
stung by conscience-pangs, declared himself
unworthy of the honor and half sobbed out-
artful old comedian that he is—something about
the return of the Prqdigal Son. But, ye ken, it
possibly wasna the Prodigal Son at all of whom
the rev. Moderator bethought himself on espying
amongst his audience the plenteous adiposity of
George. It may only have been the fatted calf.
Still, as usual, the plausible’George made the very
best of the situation.
“Never miss a meal, rqy friends,” counselled
George aforesaid at a recent meeting of the
N.S.W. Optimists’ League. Seeing which, a pes-
simistic Broken Bay fisherman sent him a gigantic
fat schnapper. The deceased fish, explained the
sender, had been a member of the Broken Bay
Optimists’ League, and its fine condition bore wit-
ness that it had acted upon George’s ad vice ; in
fact, not missing its last meal (squid bait and a
big hook) had been its undoing. In the circum-
stances reverent burial was besought of Mr. Reid
for the corpse of his dpluded scaly disciple.
George wrote back saying that the remains had
had “a most enjoyable funeral.”
Curious to what an extent the fiction about Mr.
Dan O’Connor’s marriage to a foreign countess is
accepted as fact by a lot of Sydneysiders. Old
Father Time is still the unmarried widower he
was when he left us. Some of his friends in
London must have invented the countess for
Australian consumption. And she has been ex-
tensively consumed.
Last week the Horticultural Society held a
rose show at St. James’ Hall. Roses, masses
of lilac, lily of the valley and sweet pea—
the visitors were like to die of them in
aromatic pain, like one of Poet Pope’s ladies.
But in spite of the show being labelled a Rose
Meeting a bench of the ne>v amaryllis dominated
the hall. This gorgeous, bold-looking flower,
blood-red or streaked with yellow, is a hybrid,
and is at home to its adorers under the generic
title of hippeastrum.
Miss Kate Hay, a step-sister of the late Dr.
John Hay of Coolangatta* was the prettiest ivory
satin charmeuse bride of last week, or, for that
matter, of last year. She wedded Dr. T. G.
Crowley, of Melbourne, at St. Stephen’s Church,
and, after the latest thing in receptions had been
held by her mother at the Australia, the bride got
herself into a prune, braided tailor-made, and the
happy twain (she and her bridegroom, not she and
the tailor-made) went off to the Mountains.
The Crowley-Hay nuptials occurred quietly at
the Phillip-street place of worship of the bride,
last week. The groom is an R.C. and the bride a
Presbyterian. The lofty attitude of the Church
which Dill lives to assail was responsible for a
priest losing the wedding-fee, in this case. In de-
ference to the rigid rules pf her future spouse’s
faith, the lady had agreed to be married in his
church, and so on. Straightway uprose a cleric
who said that that wouldn’t suffice 5 she must
also turn Catholic. It was more than any normal
man of spirit could endure, and in firm though
courteous terms the prelate was urged to go away
and play. This attitude of the R.C. Church in
regard to mixed marriages seems to be getting
distinctly over the odds, and is well calculated
to drive even the ultra-devotional to Primitive
Baptistry or some other weird faith.
Afterwards the extensive Hay clan and its
friends gathered at the Australia and congratu-
lated the newlyweds with all their might. Still
later a chosen few turned up in boxes and stalls at
“The Belle of New York,” the young women of
the party looking festive with bouquets and such-
like matrimonial emblems. The happy pair
left during the afternoon for the Port Hack-
ing residence of the Arthur All—, that is
to say they motored for their honeymoon to the
Blue Mountains. The punt man at Tom Ugly’s
Point, the Rockdale policeman who streaks after
scorching motorists on a bicycle with his red hair
streaming in the breeze, the centenarian parrot
that curses dodderingly in his pub by the sea, and
other old-established landmarks familiar to
society brides and ’grooms are aghast at the
almost revolutionary originality of the pair in
giving the National Park site the go-by, and the
Mayor and aldermen of Warumbul are talking
heatedly of demanding back the district’s Dread-
nought money by way of protest.
Captain Verney, the prospective bridegroom of
the hour, leaves for Melbourne on Friday with
Lord Chelmsford, and there proposes to abide for
a space and to participate in ceremonies not un-
connected with the worship of the fetich Horse or
Prad. He is to be back in Sydney on the 10th
November, for on the 11th he will enter into an
honorable undertaking to pay for a lady’s clothes
all the days of her life. Lord Dick Nevill, an old
friend of the Walker family, will accompany the
young man on his pilgrimage Sydneywards.
Cuppers who have gone to the Southern capital
from Sydney include Mrs, Gordon Wesehe, Mrs,
Edwin Ryrie, Mrs, P. Morton, Mrs. Ewan
Fraser, Mrs. Donald Maclntyre, the Littles of
Craignish, Mrs. A. Weston, the J. C. William-
sons (who have now a house at Aspendale) and the
fighting Tommy Burnses. Your Akenehi goes
down on the coming Saturday.
Bird-man Colin de Fries, brought hither by the
Taits to fly a Wright machine, is mentioned as
due in Sydney early next month by the Orontes.
He was at the Australia a few months ago
answering questions about flying, music and
waltzing, and few knew he had dashed back
Londonward. He is .to make his first skyward
movement in Sydney, and his friends hope be
won’t be nicknamed, as was Latham, the “ May-
fly.”
Contralto Kate Rooney pauses awhile for a rest
in this cit}' of the waters. She has been leading
the complex life while on tour, as witness her
hand: —“ We’ve been riding camels at Bourke,
eating delicious oranges at Pera Bore, investigat-
ing copper ore down in the earth’s innards at
Cobar, saying ‘ How marvellous ! ’ and * Good
gracious ! ’ at sight of the rich gold at Canbelego,
assisting at the final drilling of the new artesian
bore (2270 ft.) at Coonamble, shearing sheep (2|d.
a sheep) at Sunnyridge, and I’m making a gieat
collection of sketches of Western types.” For the
rest the returned warbler has been guest of honor
at many stations, engaged in snowballing at Man-
durama, celebrated the somethingth anniversary
of her marriage with a banquet sprung on her by
her company, and gave successful concerts all the
way. These songsters do seem to crowd their'
hours with play and labor.
The Hat, like the eternal feminine with which
it is associated, is of perennial interest. A girl
who wishes she had ten heads so that she could wear
ten hats, all masterpieces, tells me she has been
to “The Belle of New York,” and that the only
interesting circumstances in the production are
the hats of some of the principals. Miss
Lottie Sargent’s potais (potai is Maori for hat)
are (1) a violet one—a mass of lilac, with
pink, mauve and cream roses, and a spray of
mauve wheat; (2) a white straw with cream net
on the crown and two big, extra-crushed pink
roses and a blue bow. Miss Stirling, the Cora
Angelique of “ The Belle,” has a large white bat
with white feathers, gold tissue ribbon and a
frisky gold tassel. A pot-shaped black hat with
three ostrich plumes and a wide, flat bow of old
rose and mole velvet also falls to Miss Stirling’s
share.
At a recent big first night, five ex-actresses who
came here as strangers, and presently annexed
affluent Australians in matrimony, were seated in
a front row of the stalls. To the local girl they
were terrible examples of the danger of harboring
the attractive alien.
Miss Nora Long, the Maoriland soprano men-
tioned Jin my last letter as having taken a two
years’ engagement as first singer at the Grand
Opera House at Nice, will make her debut there as
Juliet next month. She has taken the name
of D’Argiel. So when you read of the triumphs
of Nora D’Argiel you’ll know her for the tall thin
girl who used to lift her high soprano in Sydney.
Report says she has developed as well physically
as songfully. She will sing three nights and a
matinee weekly. Her operatic work leaves her
free to accept private engagements, but she has
had to sign a contract not to sing under 20
guineas ah engagement. For the rest, her frocks
are dreams and their prices are nightmares.
I threw up my lucky ha’penny to decide whether
I should go to Melbourne to see Henley on the
Yarra or stop for the “Julius Caesar ” recital at
the Town Hall. The coin, after rising to a height
of 400 ft., fell for Shakspeare, and now, after the
recital, I am infinitely obliged to it. I did not
previously know that the Romans shook arms,
not hands. With a fine, wide, generous move-
ment of the right fore limb the meeting
senators grasp each other between the elbow
and the wrist (the arm is, of course, bare under
the toga), give a perceptible shake and release the
clasp slowly, almost reluctantly. The weediest
man amongst the senators looked majestic in his
scarlet-bordered cream toga. One thought the
garment white until Miss Lily Brayton, as
Portia Brutus, appeared in her snow-white nightie
and proved the contrast. The modernity, or rather
sameness, of human nature, too, is scally waggishly
brought home to us when the Roman populace,
the “rude mechanicals,” cheek the senators. The
cobbler barracks the clean-shaven cream and
crimson soldier-lawmakers just as “Ginger ” from
Leichhardt or Redfern might guy Senator Walker
and ask him where he got that hat. And the
Roman senator gets angry very much after the
manner of a dignified Australian senator, only to
the.former the barracker is “Thou saucy varlet.”
Mark Antony is the champion Yes-No of his-
tory. That speech of his over the imperial-purpled
dead body of Caesar proves it.
What singular forethought on Oscar Asche’s
part to include so many Roman-nosed men ! I
never saw such a collection of aristocratic
Caesarian noses, conks or beaks. It was re-
marked on the first night of the Asehe co.’s
appearance here, but the aquilines show up
against the blue-black velvet of the forum
with greater significance in the Roman play.
Arid they “go well” with the ennobling
toga. It may be that Asche selected so many
eagle beaks as contrasts to his own short, strong,
bull-dog organ. In spite of that and with his
locomotive-fender jaw he, as Brutus, really looked
what Antony called him—the noblest Roman of
them all. And his tread was planet-shaking.
The co, isthereby invited to do it again.
Mosman, that water-roundaged suburb that
lies opposite Sydney, has aspirations. The
chiefest (Sbaksperian term) of these is to play
the part of Buda to the Pesth of Sydney. The day
is not far distant when Dr. Arthur, its politi-
cal representative (provided he still holds that
qualification), will arise in Council to move that
the twin cities’ names be connected by a hyphen,
or a bridge—Mosman-Sydnev. Half, the Sydney-
siders who get married go to live at Mosman
(worse luck !). Every place where, five years ago,
flourished the flannel flower is now disfigured with
the jerry-builder’s red cottages; story-writers are
laying the scenes of their tales at Mosman, and
every night in the week there’s a something of Itn*
portance on at its town hall—either a hall, or bazaar
or an operatic performance. Last Saturday this
ambitious suburb held its inaugural flower and
Vegetable show. All the produce came from the
gardens of local residents, There was a cabbage
that Would have brought tears of envy to the eyes
of a vegetable John. There was also a flower
hat that Flora herself might wear when
a-visiting amongst the other goddesses. The
crown was fashioned of white carnations,
and the remainder of the surface was
mostly pale yellow rosebuds. A cluster of
pale pink buds nodded at the left side, but the
sweetest, cutest part of the fragrant confection
was the under-side of the brim. Ivy leaves, sewn
■overlapping-wise, it was. And only the possible
danger of intrusive acquaintances corning up to
smell my hat prevents me making and wearing
its like. Think of being able to wear a fresh hat
every morning—seven hats a week.
You can’t be born respectably in Sydney
unless you are born in the Herald at half a
crown. To get married in Sydney without a
two-and-sixpenny hand in the game being taken
bv the Herald is merely to live without benefit
of clergy ; and to die in Sydney without dying in
the Herald is practically to remain unburied.
No merely ordinary citizen can reasonably hope
to have a respectable funeral unless it’s adver-
tised in the Herald about eight times. On two
succeeding days recently I saw in the Fairfax
paper 16 advts. relating to one funeral and 14
referring to another. For a long while the
management apparently put its foot down on
matrimonial advts., but they are again coming
along beautifully. Saturday before last two
young ladies advertised for “ two elderly gents, of
means, view mat.” On the other hand, the Tele-
graph seems to specialise a good deal in houses,
wooden and qtherwise. Thus, you advertise your
wooden house in the Telegraph as a matter of
course, and your wooden overcoat in the other
paper.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

AS A WOMAN TREATETH HER COMPLEXION, SO IT IS
THE ADVICE OF A WELL-KNOWN STAGE BEADTY.
THIS is the story of a girl from Bendigo. She had
ambition, talent and beauty. Wider horizons
lured her on. It seems only a very short while
since she joined London’s multitudinous ranks
of the aspiring, but already this statuesque Bendigo
girl, Miss Alice Crawford, thanks to her charming per-
sonality, which makes her a splendid subject for the
artist’s fancy, has been winning increasing fame with
each passing theatrical season. As by her admirable
and successful acting she has gained plaudits and
undeniable appreciation, so she now bids fair to gain
the thanks and gratitude of many Englishwomen for
having pointed out to them the infallible means for the
preservation of Complexion-Beauty. In a letter repro-
duced on this page, she says of Valaze Skin-Food and
Beautifier :
“ Valaze has done my skin such a lot of good. No
one knoivs better than yourself how much an actress’s
complexion must sufter through the exacting require-
ments of her calling. Your Skin-food, Valaze, does
precisely what the skin requires ; it preserves its tone,
whiteness and clearness as no other preparation has
done.”
Miss Crawford then continues :
“ When I have said that I have only vaguely hinted
at the true pleasure, satisfaction and benefit which I
derive from it. All actresses should use it daily.”
These words, coming from an actress blessed with
such charm as is Miss Crawford’s happy possession, are
well worth pondering, because there are none quicker
to realise than stage-folk that while talent is a great
thing, mental equipment and true artistic Came iff
are most valuable possessions, physical ‘nkth'active'ness'
frequently finds them wanting when weighed with them
in the balance. .
To command success you must look it.
Miss Crawford’s letter is of further interest, because
it illustrates so well.the satisfaction one feels when one
has obtained the best in any one thing.
Valaze ACTS on the skin, seeking out the deepest
layers, the deepest tissues, the deepest cells, and there
works like Nature works, thoroughly and surely, for
skin health, purity, color, freshness, for skin beauty in
every sense.
The skin that feeds on Valaze can bear the brunt of
all climate condifiohs, of all moods of weather, of heat
and of cold, of atmosphere dry and damp.
The Valaze? complexion knows no speck or freckle,
as the Valaze skin knows no line or crowsfoot.
Valaze-nourished tissues are never depressed. A
Valaze face never looks tired. Valaze is, indeed, the
apex in complexion requisites.

MISS ALICE CRAWFORD.
The price of Valaze is 3s. 6d., 6s. 6d. a jar, 6d.
postage.
My book, “Beauty in the Making,” which forms
the most scientific discussion on the subject of the care
and treatment of the complexion, can be obtained free
on application, enclosing threepence for postage. It
furnishes details of other complexion preparations
which I have brought with me from my home-town,
Vienna, and from Russia. These are all intended for
home treatment, and serve for every imaginable re-
quirement of the complexion.
These specialties have been tested under every clime.
I have studied their action on the skin in the tropical
heat of Australasia and India, in the moderate zones of
Central Europe, in the cold latitudes of Canada and St.
Petersburg, and under the uncertain and variable con-
ditions of England.
The names and prices of some of them are :
Nouvena Poudre, a “fat ” powder for dry and normal
skins. This powder is the only preparation of its kind
known which is a skin food as well ; 25., 3s. and ss.
Valaze Herbal Powder, for greasy skins ; 25., 3s. and
ss. Yalaze Complexion Soap, made of rare herbs and
almonds; pure, wholesome, economical; lasts for several
months ; 2s. a cake. Dr. Lykuski’s Yalaze Blackhead
and Open Pore Cure vanishes every trace of these dis-
figurements, and is an unfailing specialty for coarse
and greasy skins. It closes unduly open pores,
and refines the skin texture ; 2s. lOd. posted. A
preparation which, in the words of a grateful
London client, well known for beauty, “brings the
fires of youth back to the face,” is the "Valaze
Liquidine. It dispels undue redness of nose and
face, and prevents blackheads and pimples by acting
directly on the pores, and freeing them of waste matter,
grease and dirt, which clog them, so that the breath-
ing of the skin remains unimpeded, and circulation is
improved; Bs. 6d. a bottle. Valaze Lip Lustre, for
dull, blanched lips ; biting and wetting will not displace
the coloring it imparts ; 2s. 6d. and 3s.
To ensure the promptest attention, all orders, re-
quests for information and applications for appointment
should be addressed to my Yalaze Institute, 158
Pitt Street, Sydney; 274 a Collins Street, Melbourne ;
and at Wellington and London.

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture of the most desirable Motor Tyres—and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,” and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to be certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 25, 1909.
My Dear Yarrik,—
Henley is growing into a wonderful affair. It
develops characteristics individual enough to give
distinction to an unborrowed name, despite the
wild endeavors of the hawty committee in the
direction of purely English lines, don’t you
know. Saturday was a brilliant blue day,
and the crowds —seething, good-tempered, holi-
day-making crowds—drifted in a peculiar free
atmosphere of their own—not only in the
extensive, expensive enclosures, but' over the
bridge and round the avenues and into every nook
and cranny for quite a mile in many directions.
The lawns along the banks at the back of the
river—if a river has a back—and the shrubby
grass plots of Alexandra Avenue that curves
beyond, made holiday places for holiday-frocked
people. Motors by the hundred had much ado to
toot and honk their way to the “Reserve En-
trance.” The houseboats have been pushed
farther still down stream until they touch
Blunder’s Ferry—a pretty spot on the much-
maligned Yarra, at the foot of the Botanical
Gardens. The two-and one-shilling entrance fees
charged at the enclosure go to the improvement
of the Yarra banks, as do the rents charged for
houseboat room. There is little to mock at now
in the Yarra banks, once so bare and ugly.
Yet Henley has only existed for five
seasons. Such a change, niv countrymen !
Australian Henley No. 1 showed a few excited
races, a goodly crowd, and a smattering of mangy
houseboats (i.e., coal barges half disguised with
flowers and “art” muslin) huddled in a bend of
the river. Now the houseboats are a blaze of
competitive splendor. Even little dinky rowing
boats are deliberate schemes of color, and there
are more motor launches than Melbourne thought
of a year or two back. Nowadays, too, the crowd
on the banks makes it a Cup day. Every feminine,
whether she thinks in hundreds of pounds or in
shillings, studies out a Henley dress and hat.
Everything was so much larger than even last
year’s largeness that tile committee got hot and
red-faced and lost its temper before the show got
going. Even when the Excellencies were arriving
at their own particular dog-box things were in
such a fluster that the Union Jack got hoisted
wrong side up, and the poor Lion, standing on
his head, kicked indignantly in the north wind
until he was turned right side up. There were
some special and altogether swagger lunches on
the houseboats, engineered for the Very Few.
The gaud-Mayor was so pleased at his re-election
that his boat flamed in a spree-like red—or
perhaps the scarlet betokened his military rank.
Anyhow it was a hideous battle-cry of color in the
heat of the day, but it blazed with good red
electric effect in the night. The Commercial
Travellers were also stridently red. The Aus-
tralian Club lay low in pale modest blue,
with a shady bungalow roof that matched
the sky. The Alexandra Puss Club waved glory
green pennants, but the boat was unhappy under
its bilious greenery-yallery paint. The Athenaeum
Club had, as usual, the largest boat—a big, solid
Great Eastern, with winch decks turned into
ferny corners, and its beaming solid comfortable
hosts gave all the pretty girls the Henley of their
lives. Then this club was thoughtful enough to
spread crimson felt for the showing up of dainty
frocks and shoes. Besides companion ladders
fore and aft, there were gangways to port and
starboard—one to the bank, t’other to the river—
and the clubbers had engaged motor launches so
that they could show their guests the rest of the
Yarra. Incidentally, the master-man of the
launches cursed deeply and softly and continuously
as he came backwards and forwards among the
moths and butterflies of small craft that hung to
the moorings. This club had much of the fat of
the entertaining. Masked singers came aboard
and warbled to the accompaniment of an
orchestra. The pretty Winter Garden girls en-
gineered the pink ice and the strawberry.
The slick white Gadfly—the swiftest motor-
launch here—tabooed womankind and ran only
flannelled masculine creatures. A Peter Pan set
of pirates flung skull and crossbones to the wind.
Theatrical folk were restricted to day-time
parade. Melba motored down early and left very
early to be rested for her concert. In spite of the
Henley crush there were still people left in Mel-
bourne, and they rushed, in the heat and dust of
the afternoon, to secure front seats that night. A
huge multitude stood outside the Exhibition for
hours, each with a heated two-and-sixpence held
in a feverish hand. Mrs. Bland Holt ap-
peared ac the King’s on Saturday night. She
took her Henley (with Blan’olt himself) at
lunch-time on the Athenaeum Club craft. Dainty
Fan Dango, in white with a juvenile blue sash,
put in the afternoon there. Pantomime Boy
Meredro, in the cutest thing in linen, showed her
dimples all day.
The Savage Club stands frigidly aloof from the
line of boats. It has its own special bit of lawn
and puts up its canvas mia-mia barricaded and
bristling with awful weapons and gruesome
scalps.
To the veriest few is Henley a race. An occa-
sional shouting and a glimpse of fleeting colored
rowing togs distract the girl on the bank for an
odd moment or so. But the oarsmen themselves
say this year was a racing year. The rule of the
river was so stringent that they even had room to
row. Some artistic gazers murmured that things
were more picturesque in the days when any sort
of old craft rambled any old where on the course.
Until the new rule was made as one of the
statutes of the Medes and Persians, oarsmen
bucked at training. Aforetime the racers were
half their time swimming out of the river, drag-
ing their boats behind them and cursing because
they had to dock for repairs, while lunatics in a
flower barge, who knew no more of rowing than
they did of the Boots of Perdition, guffawed and
giggled at their mishap. This time there was a
straight course, good racing and not one upset.
From this time on there is likely to be a zest in
the training—a prospect of a good strong pull and
fairplay.
A beautiful sight at Henley was blase Guy
Madden, girl-less, reposing like Nero in the
cushioned bows of a boat and looking gloomily on
the fields of femininity; while Willy Kelly
perched like a sparrow on the stern, showing a
glimpse of the power and the glory of his scarlet
socks. Between the two beauties was one fat
man doing all the rowing and perspiring like
Hotness.
To-day, in Collins-street, I saw a motor-car
chock-a-block with chimney-pot hats—new shining
tunnel-hats with men under them. It was an open
motor, and the frock-coated men sat on each other,
so great was the company of these shining
angelic beings. They were Governors, swarming
into the city even as the bookie swarms—for the
races. It was a beautiful sight. Some of the
company may have been gentlemen helps, but
their hats shone with even more radiance than the
Governors’. Really, the hat of an aide-de-camp is
as the sun in its zenith, or like broken bottles in a
summer noon. In fact, were it not a busy day,
poetry would well up at the very thought of these
heavenly tiles. An A.D.C.’s hat is his badge
—more so even than blue or purple lapels.
He is never without it. A mere Gover-
nor may occasionally relapse into a squashy
lid when there are not too many people looking,
but the aide — never. There is a belief suddenly
borne in on me that the crush hat—that
swaggah opera concern—originated as a nightcap
for gentlemen helps. The poor things were not
allowed to sleep without their tall hats in case of
fire or earthquake. It would not be the thing
for the Governor to escape unless “accompanied
by Secretary Inkpot or Captain Horsemar.ne.”
Probably they used their second-best hats for
bedtime, and one night, in the sleeplessness of
horrible discomfort, a brilliant A.D.C. evolved the
happy soup-plate crush hat. Ever after aides
slept in opera hats, except (by law) on moonlight
nights because then the dull shineless surface
would be apparent. Dear Yarrie, do you ever
contemplate the ghastly horror of living for ever in
a high hat? When the Governor stalks abroad,
the earliest up must be the A.D.C., to precede
his Excellent steps. That same aide has
sat up far into the night, poring over
time-tables and mind-racking figures. Then
during the day if hitches occur (horrible animals,
hitches), the aide must pacify the brutes. Also
he has to guide the troubled footsteps of the
besieged Gov. on to the next oyster to be opened.
He has to be at his elbow with his speech notes.
What a catastrophe if the Governor began to
speech his Norman Lindsay show talk to the
Neglected Children’s Aid Society, or his remarks
for the Epileptics to the Alexandra Club.
Poor aides !—first up, last to bed, working all
the time, ever stepping lightly upon eggs, and
trying not to break the bruised reed of conversa-
tion. Here and now I start a society for the Aid
of Aides.
The Caf4 Chantant in aid of the Melbourne
District Nursing Society that gathered at St.
Kilda Town Hall on Thursday last, might have
been a select Government House shivoo for the
multitudinousness of the Somebodies who all
rolled up at 2s. a head. Governors and people
were scattered about like ordinary mortals. The
quiet little Miss Bosanquet palled all the evening
with Miss Stuart-Monteith, the red-haired visitor
at Stonington. The Wrixon dame and the
Madden throng and the gaud Mayoress all bol-
stered up the seats nearest to the Excellent Lady.
Railway Tait and Mrs. Tait beamed on the
tableaux which held their Winnie-girl—a very
pretty picture, by the way. Mrs. Justice Isaacs
and Mrs. Tatham, who had worked like niggers to
secretary the show, gazed overall with the anxious
eyes of generals. Marjorie Isaacs led a Gotten-
berg crowd in Berlin-on-the-Spree, and blushed
every time she tossed her trousered leg over a
cane. The other trousered, blue-jumpered crew
were the two Robb girls, Miss Atherton, a
McEvoy maiden and Nancy Grice. “ Trally ”
Foster, that beauteous singing man, duetted with
the Emmerton daughter in a “Girl Behind the
Counter ” encounter. The Maddens made things
hum, and put a finger into ’most everything.
Ruby of the Dimples posed in a lover-like picture
with Keith Anthony, who was able to give his
profile its due in the limelight. Ptg 0 y Hammond.-
Clegg and Miss de Grut had practised for weeks
at the Greenaway girl dance, with Tom Payne of
the big head coaching them. They were quite
pleased with the result—as well as the
practice. Another Miss Ham-and-Clegg posed
as a pretty Merry Widow (tableau), with Norman
Hodges bending unhappily to the picture, as if
Danilo were suddenly attacked with colic,
Beatrice Madden sang a sweet little song while
the light was resting. In one living picture
Murie Huon hung rather large nude feet out of a
moon hammock and turned a pretty profile to the
house. Mrs. Harry Cornish, in a certain amount of
raiment, sat on a bough in the limelight. They had
set husband Henry at the door taking tickets, so
he couldn’t rush the platform with a glare
and an overcoat. The pretty O’Hara colleens and
Winnie Tait and half a hundred other damsels
sold the expensive strawberry and the sly-faced
ice and every other marketable thing they could
carry on ribboned trays. An occasional make-
believe maid tilted her coffee tray over unhappy
Chantant listeners under stress of ardent admira-
tion from johnnies struggling in the crowd. Then
she pouted because people who got their cafe on
the neck objected to pay half a crown for the
honor.
The Naval and Military Club is gathering
ammunition and making every preparation for a
ball in the Town Hall that is to knock things sky-
high. Fireworks and a burning kerosene stove
would be tame to the blaze of this gorgeous ’op
which is to prance on Friday—the night before
Derby day.
The Carmichaels invite a rehearsal of race
frocks—otherwise a garden party—on Monday,
November 1, at Stonington, where is a beautiful
garden, all roses and terraced lawns and faint
fragrances.
Australians are a big-breathing crowd—they
like space. Girls have just as free-handed a way
of lumping luggage, grabbing a suit-case and
dashing abroad as have the men. A flutter of a
handkerchief, and a girl is-off for a year’s spin
round the globe. The younger of the Holme
Rennie girls is back after tossing about in
a White Star liner on the homeward track
of the ill-fated Waratah. The weather was curious
and the sea surging and angry. Several times the
crowd was battened down. One lady carefully
dressed herself for the expected drowning, and
remarked that she would like to “meet her
Maker in white.” She said it in the same solemn
voice that she might use in discussing her Cup
dress. Another dame put on her oldest petticoat
in order to save her good silk one. Are men
built like that, I wonder? Is there any record of
a male having put on his best frock-coat and his
tallest hat as the ship went down ?
Gold-gilt Sternberg, of Bendigo and of the
’Ouse, gave his one ewe lamb away in marriage
last week to Mr. Cohen, who is also gilt-edged.
Miss Sternberg was one of the smartest of the
smart Bendigo maidens who trip to this town
from the golden city. She has also tripped over
plenty of the stepping-stones of the globe,
and has not long returned from the land
of the Rising- Sun, where the Monkey shines
in the East. The wedding was at the Grand Hotel,
Melbourne, and was quite a small family affair
of a double dozen guests. Dorothy Sternberg, a
young cousin, came to hold the gloves and other
necessary superfluities of the bride while the ring
was rung. Everybody partied at Her Majesty’s
in the evening for “The Catch of the Season,”
and returned for an extra special supper in the
private supper-room of the Grand. The hilarious
noise of departing motors and fleeing guests died
away at 3 a. rn.
The Collins-street Smiths —£.£., Mrs. £.£. and
Miss £ouise—landed back at the grey ancestral
humpy last week after a long and elaborate earth-
journey with a few sea trips between. The Parisian
dresses that will appear in Race week are just
jumping from their oilcloth travelling boxes in
excitement.
Picture shows are becoming a plague—like
rabbits and grasshoppers and starlings. People
are sending invitations from The Studio at Otway
Forest (turn to the south, and it’s the last gum tree
on the left), or planted in One Tree Gully. These
places are comparatively get-at-able. Bu t one genius
has the gall to invite people to Orrong-road,
Malvern—the place where the new electric tram
does not go, and which still boasts ’buses and
other prehistoric animals in its wilds.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide town :
It was a white-satined Excellency, with diamond tiara
surmounting her silvei’-grey locks, who beckoned the
world in and shook it by the hand at the Residence, the
other evening. The ostensible purpose of the revel was
to be kind to the Commerce delegates ; and, though they
had been rushed about the harbor all day, they bore up
man- and womanfully. The one available vice-regal
daughter was also white-and-silver clad ; and Mrs. Albion
Tolley, an inveterate Parisian frocker, wore a white-satin
Directoire robe. The Way dame wore pale-pink satin and
rose point; Mrs. Mayfield was in black sequined chiffon
and silk; and Mrs. Attorney-General Mitchell in silver
tissue with a black lace over-dress.
On Saturday, with Jupiter Pumphandle toiling away
again for all he was worth, Kensington Gardens were
opened by the Governor. We are proud of our gardens
in Adelaide, and this one is going to make us prouder. It
consists of 40 acres of what is known as Pile’s Paddock, a
picturesque patch sprinkled with great old gums, cud-
dled together at the foot of the hills. It has been a
favorite picnic ground for over 40 years, and now it has
been handed to the Tramways Trust to be made
into a public park, with an electric car service
running into the middle of it. The authorities
had an idea of making a kind of garden (or paddock)
party of the function ; but, as heretofore mentioned,
Jupiter Tankhandle had other plans. The flags which
marked the park boundaries drooped like depressed wash-
ing in the rain ; the people followed suit; and the only
solace was a marquee which protected the afternoon tea
and the gilded bun. And while the rain rained his Ex.
planted a tree and bade the crowd go home and do
likewise.
The Melbourne express the other day deposited here
14 trunks of frocks and sweet Marie Narelle. But she was
also a fleet Marie, and rushed on to Westralia the same
day, after making promise to burst into an Adelaide
season in a month or two.
Those entertaining Frenchwomen, Mrs. Mouchette and
Mrs. Lion, are having an exhibition of pictures, minia-
tures, old tapestries, engravings and china, at their
studio this week, and their Excellencies and society gene-
rally are flocking along to admire and buy. The studio is
an artistic oasis on the top of Steamship Build-
ings, managed by charming and interesting dames
who have a dovecote up in the middle of the hills, with a
beauteous garden where all the birds of the air are taught
to regard themselves as landed proprietors and have
crumbs distributed among them three times a day. The
studio in town is to be given up at the end of this year,
and Mrs. Mouchette and her sister are going to stay in
the garden to see that their bird friends are polite at their
meals and don’t eat their peas with the gridiron.
A special train took his Excellence and daughter Alicia
to Mount Gambier last week. The other twin, whose
name is Beatrice (they were called A and B instead of
M and N), has been wearing her prettiest chiffons and
smiles for the benefit of the eastern States. But on
Tuesday she came back to us to help her mother cope
with the rush of rose shows, garden revels and other
floricultural items.
Rose shows were littered all over last week. On Tues-
day one happened in the Unley Town Hall, where her
Ex. praised its complexion, and asked it to consider itself
opened. On Wednesday there was another at Norwood,
which defied the world to prove that it wasn’t the finest
rose-show on earth. Lady Bosanquet made more sooth-
ing remarks here ; the available daughter had gone over
in the morning to decide sundry weighty matters about
prize dinner-tables and bouquets. But that didn’t end
it. On Thursday the Adelaide roses met in the Town
Hall. Her Excellence this time was helped by the Way
dame to bear the responsibility of judging. And the
matter didn’t finish even there. On Saturday St. Peters
caught the prevailing fever, and showed off at the local
hall all the afternoon and evening.
All this floriculture reminds me that an Adelaide scribe,
Mr. J. M. Black, has just published a book on “The
Naturalised Flora of South Australia.” He is a front
lamp of the Field Naturalists, Botanical Society, and all
the other bodies that are privileged to call the Gompho-
carpus arborescentt, and the Barnyardius marigoldium
by their unchristian names. And he has illustrated the
book with 300 drawings. Mr. Black mixes botany and
languages, but is a delightful man nevertheless. His
sister is the widow of the late d’Oyley Carte.
The Commerce delegates, or rather their three avail-
able wives—Mrs. Ayrton, Mrs. Ives and Mrs. Barrow —
conspired together last week at the South Australian.
The result' was an impromptu reception to those people
who have been showing them the country with so much
vigor and vim. They stuck 40,000 roses in the hair of the
reception room, ordered in ices, and Adelaide sent some
of its best frocks to complete the picture. Mrs. Barrow
had some Limerick lace' on a navy frock for which I
would have become a burglar but for the sake of
the family. Mrs. Ives wore a pretty garment of a
pineapple tint, and Mrs. Ayrton a bright blue
shimmer)' frock and rose-wreathed hat. There were
two Mueeke girls, one nut-brown and the other grey-
clad. Mrs. Arnold Davey, in Directoire embroidered
chiffons and blue-plumed hat, the George Deans’ daugh-
ter in navy shantung and with a big black hat on her fair
locks, the G. F. Clelands, John Hills, Prossers and Chas.
Goodes all assisted in the distribution of tea and compli-
ments.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
Interesting to know how many of the finest
complexions that will brave the elements and
charm the eye at Flemington, this Cup time, owe
a touch of supernatural charm to Valaze. The
Valaze establishment in Melbourne is said to be
the Mecca of all smart women from the country
who come up for the races. That it is the favorite
place of worship for local feminine loveliness
seems to go without saying. Everybody
who is anybody must be either “finished off”
at the temple of toilet mysteries itself or
supplied with the essentials for home treat-
ment. The fact is admitted, but of direct
evidence in support thereof there is nothing
to swear by. Valaze never gives itself away, so
to speak. What complexion could have been
more irreproachable than that of Helena Rubin-
stein (now Mrs. Titus), who introduced the “skin-
food” to Australia and is at present presiding over
her Valaze Salon in London ? The same note of
interrogation applies to the serenely pale face of
Cesca Rubinstein, her sister, manageress of the
rooms in Melbourne. One looks for signs of
make-up in the beauty of Miss Cesca, but finds no
suggestion of art. Her assistants —the sweet girl
graduates— are equally innocent of embellish-
ment, as far as the inquiring eye can discover.
Yet it is assumed to be there. The sceptic who
makes these remarks has come to the conclusion
that in the matter of Valaze use is second nature.
Bob Hodge, the new member for Burnett,
used to be member for Rosewood. Five years ago
he was defeated, went to the Kilkivan district,
became a publican, sold out lately for £2OOO and
£6 a week for 10 years, contested the seat and
won. Go into a pub, young man—but go behind
the bar.

SCIENCE SPEAKS.
In the treatment of any wound or sore, you
must not disregard the facts revealed by
scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanently it is essentia] to cleanse the affected
tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while allaying all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies thoroughly.
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wounds, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases in cases of long standing.
This famous Ointment is now manufactured in
Australia, and will b * sent post paid to any
address upon receipt of price—3/6.
Please note— Chase’s Universal Ointment is
always supplied in glass jars to avoid contact
with metal.

Helps for Pale Weak Languid
People,

A Treatment to Restore the
Blood supply that has
been very successful.
There is only this to tell people who are pale,
weak and bloodless. You are pale and weak
because you haven’t enough blood, and you won’t
he better until your blood supply is increased.
You shouldn’t lose time in increasing your blood
snpplv, for people who neglect anaemia are often
the ones who slip into a decline. Further when
you have increased your blood supply you can
reasonably expect to have a good color, to have
lost that tired, weary, breathless feeling, to have
a. good appetite and to get good nourishment from
your food. Probably you know all this.
Now to get more hlood. If you have ever heard
of anything that will make new blood and bring
buoyant happy health quicker than Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, take it. We have never ; we even
haven’t heard of anything half so good. They are
scientifically compounded for the very purpose,
and how well they do their work the hundreds of
cures of anaemia in Australia bear out. The
following case is a fair sample of what they do.
“ I was always inclined to delicacy as a young
girl, and after marriage I became anaemic,” said
Mrs. Arthur Whitmore, 70 Sewell Street, East
Fremantle. “ I couldn’t get my strength up after
my little boy was born. My appetite was very
poor and I dare not take meat. I lived mostly on
milk foods. I lost all rnv color. My face got
sallow. I only fancied pickles, lemons and vine-
gar; as to raw rice, I’d eat handfuls of it. It was
no use saying these things were bad for me ; I
fairly craved for them. I fell away in flesh and
got pitiably thin. My feet and hands were
always cold, and if I stood long on my feet my
ankles would swell up. Often I’d get up in the
morning and feel so heavy and dizzy that I knew
a violent, splitting headache was coming on
and would last all day, so I would have to go and
lie down, not bearing anyone to speak or make a
noise. I never felt well, especially in the fore part
of the day. I’d wonder how I was going to get
through my housework. It was as much as I could
do sometimes to lift a broom. My limbs seemed
to have no strength in them. It was as if they
were bending under me. I had so little strength
that I’d often faint straight off and go down flat.
I went to the doctor and he said that I was run
down. I took some bottles of medicine, but got
no relief. I was ailing about eight months when
I started Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. From the
first rny health began to return. I gradually lost
the craving for vinegar and starch, and regained
the desire for wholesome food, and soon I was
eating quite heartily. I felt my blood getting
much richer and the color returned to my face.
The difference two boxes made was wonderful.
The price is 2s. 9d. per box, (> boxes 15s. 3d.,
and if you have trouble in getting them, send a
postal note for the amount to the Dr. Williams’
Medicine Co. of Australasia, Ltd., Sydney, and
they will be sent post free by return mail.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
SPITE.
Don’t think that your tax will burst up the big estates;
the chances are that once the tax is imposed the owners
will hang on to their land tighter than ever, if only to
spite those who put on the ta x.—Carlisle in his speech
against the proposed Vic. land-tax.
The most gigantic trust or combine ever
heard of is said to be forming in the U.S., the idea
being to secure a monopoly of water-power over
the whole Uncle Sam territory. The Foreign-
trader always says that trusts are caused wholly
by Protection, so presumably his remedy in this
case will be to take the duty off water and import
it freely in kegs.
Even the potato is crying aloud for unifica-
tion and reconstruction. Though the different
State Ministers lately came to ap agreement
regarding Irish blight and the transportation of
spuds from suspected districts in other States, the
compact has not been kept, for Ma State sjf ill refuses
admission to clean potatoes from her neighbors,
though lots of her own tubers are blighted. Now
Victoria threatens to retaliate by prohibiting the
importation of tomatoes from Ma if they come
from blighted districts—and it is pretty certain
that they mostly will come from blighted districts.
So long as affected districts are quarantined, it is
difficult to see what a State boundary has to do
with the matter. It was to do away with these
absurd discriminations that Australia federated ;
but a swarm of State insects are busy trying to
block progress in that direction, and—worse still
—Australia lets them do it.
Sydney Telegraph barks with ferocity at
the revived N. : .W. Freetrade League. Itshould,
if it had any r ipect for principle, be beside the
League, or somewhere near, taking its share of
the eggs of public derision ; but that’s not its
way. Instead it calls the League bogus, a sham,
a soi-disant Freetrade body, and all the other
offensive names which perverts sling at their old
comrades. N.S.W. has gone ahead so vigorously
under Protection that the Freetrade banner
becomes very heavy to carry these days—it feels
as if it had a corpse on the top of the staff, or
something like that—and only a very hardened
enthusiast would drag the discredited old luggage
around.
Lands Minister McKenzie (Vic.) sent some
of his constituents home, the other day, feeling as
though iced frogs were skating down their spines.
Said McKenzie:—
He had noticed that municipal councils were “ instruct-
ing-” their members to vote against the Bill. But many
of the councillors were large landholders, and if his
Government were defeated over this matter it would go
out. Then they would probably get a Labor Government
with a far more drastic measure. Country land-holder
and city property-owner were both squealing ; but land
taxation had to come no matter who was in power.
The biggest development that British in-
dustries have experienced of late has arisen through
high-handed Protection. A little over a year ago
an Act was passed which set forth that every
foreigner who patented a new invention in the
United Kingdom must manufacture the patented
article in the United Kingdom to meet the local
demand, or else have his patent revoked. So,
under compulsion, 24 great new industries have
been established in England alone during a single
year. It is good business, but it is mighty bad
Freetrade.
“S.R.” discourses oil guns :
After accepting a tender for an up-to-date small-arms
plant, the Australian Defence Department has made what
looks like a bad mistake : it is having the machinery
adapted to the Enfield standard ; and the Enfield is not
the best rifle to be had these days. There is no comfort
in the statement that the new weapons will be sounder
and better finished than those at present supplied. The
type does not compare favorably with most of the well-
known makes. The Mark 111. Lee-Enfield short rifle—
the baptismal name of the new slayer—is not even equal
to the old pattern Lee-Enfield. For long range shooting,
the rifleman has no hesitation in choosing the older gun.
After the last meeting at Bisley the British War Office
received an awful roasting over the Mark 111., and the
only retort it could make was to point to the two lonely
successes scored by the gun. Unfortunately for the
W. 0., both the wins were scored over short distances, so
they weren’t much support to the argument. It was also
alleged at the time against the Mark 111. that the breech
mechanism was too weak for a military weapon, and a
long controversy in the papers dug up the interesting
fact that the cordite charge for the regulation ball car-
tridge had been reduced. Before that cat rushed out of
the official sack, a lot of shooters had been complaining
of inferior ammunition. The Canadian Ross gun, at the
same meeting, was praised by an enormous proportion of
the shots present. The standardisation of weapons isn’t
going to be of much use to the Australian forces if
Britain is to set an inferior standard. It would be a
darned sight better for this country to invent something
for itself, like the gentle Kanuck, or even to slavishly
imitate one of the really first-class shooting irons. I
don’t see any advantage in standing shoulder to shoulder
with Ma, if Ma is going to totter along in the rear of the
procession.
Any old rags ? Britain, the boss shoddy
shop of the world, is a steady buyer. In the
last three years Australia has sent J. Bull £51,485
worth of its cast-off socks and pensioned under-
clothes and other such trifles. It sends Bull 20
times more rags than it does rum ; in fact, in most
years it sends him more rags than dried fruit, of
which this country ough t to be producing thousands
of tons; and for every £1 he pays Australia for
jams and jellies the rag bill is just over £5O.
But an even more amazing thing is that,
while J. Bull is a steady importer of Aus-
tralia’s old clo’es, Australia now and again
imports a few sacks full from Bull—pro-
bably the same old clo’es, worn a few
weeks in a London slum, and then stuffed
into another bag and sent back this way
again. Still, compared with the rags that
Australia sends father Bull, Australia’s im-
ports are very small, never amounting to more
than a few hundred pounds’ worth a year.
Almost everywhere the miner is the re-
liable democrat. In the Queensland elections
every gold-mining district voted Labor Straight-
Charters Towers, Gympie, Mount Morgan, Croy-
don, Clermont, Thornborough and Georgetown.
Andy Dawson, Queensland's first Labor Premier,
was a goldfields man. Earle, Tasmania’s first
Labor Premier, is a miner. Jack Verran, S.
Australia’s Labor party leader, represents the
Moonta men. Bach, of Westralia, represents
Brown Hill, another mining camp. And still, in
spite of all that and a great deal more, the first
line of this par must have its “almost ” ; for the
Lithgow (N.S.W.) coalfield for years sent Joe
Cook to the House, and is now represented by the
Foreign-trader Bowden, apparently on the prin-
eiple that the less coal the Australian miner has to
supply to Australian factories the better.
Wilks, M.H.R., of Dailey (N.S.W.), used
to claim that he was an enthusiastic Foreign-
trader and Shoddyist, and on the strength of his
more-or-less gospel oath to that effect got the im-
porters’ vote at last election. But Balmain,
which is part of Wilks’ electorate, is the
home of certain industries, and when it came
to applying the glorious doctrine of Cobden
to those particular industries Wilks heaved the
glorious doctrine into Darling Harbor, and
reached out for all the Protection he could get.
Naturally the Cobdenites said that sort of thing
wasn’t Freetrade, and now the Sydney Freetrade
League proposes to put up a candidate against
Freetectionist Wilks. So between Laborist
Howe, who pushed him hard at last election and
has been on his trail ever since, and the Freetrade
League’s candidate, and a possible selected
“ Liberal ” candidate (because Wilks hasn’t been
too nice to the Fusion of late), William of Derry
should have a busy time ahead.
Jabez Coon, M.H.R. (Vic.), is acquiring
some importance as a temperance advocate. Jabe
now proposes the insertion of a clause in the
Defence Bill to provide that “no intoxicating or
spirituous liquors shall be used or sold at any
naval or military canteen, camp, fort or post.”
Evidently he has been basking in the shade of
Sammy Mauger, and wants the Commonwealth
army to fight and “swear terribly ”on water. Is
there any record of a teetotal army doing great
things except when it was drunk with fanaticism?
Or a vegetarian army ? Ora fish-eating army ?
IN ADELAIDE.
THE HUMORIST : “ Why all this fuss about wood-
blocking our streets? Why, if our Legisla-
tive Councillors would put their heads to-
gether the thing would be done."
Representative Bamford proposes a couple
of quaint amendments to the Defence Bill—one
that qualified male electors under 50 years of age
who fail to vote shall he liable to serve in the
Citizen Forces without pay ; and the other that
healthy males between 28 and 55, marriageable
but unmarried, shall also serve gratis for l(i days
per annum. They are cheerful propositions, and
both aim the brick where something hard
and sudden is called for; but they have this
objection, that they make the Defence Force a
means of punishment. And that is about the last
idea that this country ought to encourage.
Hutchison (S.A.) made a commendable
effort, t’other day, to deprive the Commonwealth
citizen forces of a bit of frill. During the con-
sideration of the Defence Bill in committee he
moved :
(a) The citizen forces shall be instructed only in those
duties that are required of them in war ; (6) there shall
be no military funerals in uniform except on active ser-
vice or in the case of those who have been on active ser-
vice ; (c) military uniforms shall be of one character only
as prescribed, and shall be worn only on parade or other
military duty ; uniforms shall be supplied free of charge
to all ranks, including officers ; (d) the system of military
salutes shall be reduced to the simplest form for military
discipline.
He, didn’t carry his point, but the proposal was a
monument of common-sense all the same.
N.S.W. Treasurer Twaddell told the
National Rifle Association banqueters the other
night that he was really anxious about the stra-
tegical position of Australia: —
One of the weakest spots in Australia was the Northern
Territory. It was so far away, and it had so few people.
Railway connection with the north was imperative. A
line should be constructed from Bourke to Cunnainulla,
and thence via Lougreach, Winton and Cloncurry to Pine
Creek, the southern terminus of the railway to Palmer-
ston. This was a great national work. Until this was
done Australia was in a weak strategical position.
Yet let no bad-minded person insinuate that
Twaddell is barracking for the round-about,
expensive, semi-coastal, largely-desert railway,
instead of the straight, all-Federal line from
Port Augusta to Port Darwin, in order to drag
the Northern Territory’s trade to Sydney. ’Twere
an unworthy thought! Twaddell wasn’t thinking
of his Congestion Policy at all. He was only
worried about the large interests of Australia.
AUSTRALIA OR MISTER WADE?

with Mr. Wade.

HIS EMPLOYER: “Hi, Deakin! Who th ’ L are
you paid t’ work for? ”
“Jean Sibi ” gives back-talk to the legal
profession :
Costs had an invigorating experience one day lately.
There was some small discussion as to the distribution of
a large estate, and eight ordinary barristers and three
K.C.’s, instructed by about a borough of solicitors, col-
lected to guard the various interests concerned. It is not
often that the Vic. Practice Court beholds so many Gents
doing nothin#- in particular with such success, and it is
less often that the old place displays such an air of queer
activity. It had that curious, animated appearance that
a street might have if a blind man dropped a ha’penny
and a herd of Armenians helped him to look for it.
The Federal Home Affairs Department
recently gave a local industry a chance of showing
what it could do, and it responded promptly y
doing the imported article brown. Heretoror ,
the padlocks for ballot-boxes have been importe
at a cost of 4s. (id. each, but a Tasmanian nrm
lately offered to turn out a similar article tor
3s. lid., and scooped the order for 6000 locks.
Yet Protection, according to the Freetrade
fanatics, “bolsters up local monopolies at public
expense.”
Melbourne Age lately published some
figures demonstrating how the Victorian
country shires batten on the city tax-
payer. Taking a bunch of shires, it
showed that their municipal valuations
are, on an average, 48 per cent., and in
some particularly horrible cases 80 to JO
per cent, below those of the Victorian
Water Supply Commission. Hence, when
they levy a feeble nominal rate of about Is.
in the £, as they generally do, they are
actually levying a much feebler rate of
a very few coppers in the £ on the
proper valuation. Of course they are
unable to support themselves by their
own taxation, and have to come cadging
to the Government whenever they want
money. They are always wanting and
always cadging, and a complacent Gov-
ernment is always ready to oblige. This
year the Weary Ministry has earmarked
something over £300,000 to give them,
and talks about it as if it were a right
honorable deed instead of a prodigious
public larceny.
A dead set is being made in Adelaide
against the train running down King William-
street, and the Labor members are seeking to
oust it in favor of the electric tram. The on-
slaught casts a bright blue light upon the anomalous
fact that Railway-Commissioner Moncrieff is a,lso
Chairman of the Tramway Trust. He is fighting
himself vigorously, and giving himself much
anxiety in both capacities over this matter.

So long as the Country will stand for it, and the
Treasurer’s hand is strong ;
They never do anything foolish —nay, nor anything
hasty-like,
And they’ll probably bumble along like this till the
Country goes on strike.
They browse all day in the sun, their hoofs in the good
green Guv’ment grass,
And they pay small heed to the flight of time as the
beautiful moments pass;
They bask in the salary sunshine still, and they munch
green stalks at will,
For life is short, though sweet, and it’s well to take one’s
Guv’ment fill.
They’ve nibbled for months on the lotus flats, where the
fodder is sweet and long,
And the loud, wild cry of the Country comes to their ears
like a midge’s song.
"Vet who in the world will blame them now for taking
their Guv’ment whacks,
If the Country’s getting theirdoom prepared in the shape
of a sharpened axe?
They live their lives in a waking dream, and their days
go by like smoke ;
The Guv’ment lolls on the sward and loafs like a common
or garden bloke ;
There’s little to chain the wandering thought, these
warm kind dreamy days
When the Guv’ment senses the Truth of Things through a
blithering blissful haze,
And the call o’ the country’s hardly heard at the Com-
monwealth duty-works,
Where the Guv’ment'boss in the grateful shade of his
Guv’ment caucus lurks...
The drowsy day and the lazy day—they pass, and the day
draws nigh,
When down to the slaying the Land will come, red wrath
in its terrible eye!
VICTORIA.

NOTIONS
Now that a single line of railway has been laid
from South Kensington to the Melbourne City Abattoirs,
which are close to the southern boundary of theFleming-
t.on racecourse, a new way of conveying the people to the
Cup and other V.R.C. race meetings comes into sight.
Thousands of flatites could be carried by this new route,
if only there were a double line, and this would relieve
the frightfully congested traffic by the ordinary route on
the days of the big horse gambles.
The “ open ” appearance of the Melbourne Cup
at time of writing is indicated by the unlawful betting-
lists quotations which are not 'published in the daily
press. Bookmakers offer a price “bar five,” the five
oarred ones being Trafalgar, Alawa, Pendil, Post Town
and Prince Foote. The temptation to back one’s fancy
before the V.R.C. meeting has started is not very
strong. It were better, perhaps, to wait until
the day, and then risk an investment in the
light of Derby Day revelations and latest whispers
from the blessed stables. Probably the aspect of the
situation will be greatly changed on Saturday. The Mel-
bourne Stakes, the Derby, and even the Hotham Handi-
cap may have luminous results. Meanwhile the Cup
looks as open as it was last year, when Lord Nolan, the
winner, went out at 16 to 1, and the average starting
price of the three placed horses was 27 to 1.
How about the three-year-olds of this season ?
They have made no show at all in the big handicaps
thus far. Compared with their elders, the youngsters—
bar one—are cutting a great lack of ice in public estima-
tion. The one exception, of course, is Prince Foote, the
little bay with three white feet and a singularly piebald
nozzle, who won th.e Sydney Derby in brilliant style, after
being frequently blocked. The exact measure of Prince
Foote’s excellence could be more easily gauged if the other
three-year-olds had done anything worth mentioning.
They certainly haven’t. Patronatus, who ran second to
the little champion in the Derby at Randwick, disgraced
himself in subsequent races. Danilo (third in the Derby)
was nowhere in the Metropolitan. The Racing Calendar
shows no reason why By Play should not be Prince Foote’s'
most formidable opponent among the youngsters, and
should the favorite get invalided by bis cracked hoof the
present writer'would as soon back By Play for the Derby
oil Saturday as any of the others. 'However, assuming
that the flaw in the favorite’s understanding 1 is not so
very serious after all, the tip for the V.R.C. Derby is
Prince Foote, By Play and Danilo, in that order. If
the race be fast and the placed horses finish
fairly close together, all three of them should have
a chance in the Cup. If this writer were bound to select
two likely Derby horses for the Cup a week prior to the
event, he would take Prince Foote and By Play. The
former is already handicapped with 7st. 91b., a Derby
winner’s weight; the latter stands at 6st. illb. Con-
sidering the difference in the Cup weights of the three-
year-olds, together with the fact that a Derby winner has
to carry 7st. 91b., it is absolutely impossible to say which
of them will be the most promising chance next Tuesday'.
Patronatus, for instance, is in the Cup at 6st. 71b. Should
he run Prince Foote to a head in the Derby, he will in the
Cup have a stone the best of the weights, after allowing
21b. for the head defeat. Punters are bound to remember
that it was the light weight which accounted for Lord
Nolan’s victory last year.
In considering the Cup, the least prosy plan is
to set up a number of names as skittles, ere proceeding
to knock most of them over, and to do this without
stating any reasons why the names of other probable
starters are not set up at all. The Bulletin field includes
Trafalgar, Alawa, Lord Nolan, Post Town, Pendil, King’s
Cross, Artillerie, Ungarie, Blue Book, Prince Foote,
Flavinius, Flavel, D'unolly, Knox, Didus, Delaware,
Trelo Vouni, By Play, and the three horses placed
in the Derby', if two of them be not already named.
Lord Nolan is pitted in general reasoning against Pendil.
Both are small horses with heavy burdens. The former
could make no impression on Trafalgar in their two races
at Randwiek recently 7. On paper he has no chance to
beat the big chestnut at even weights (9st. lib.), whereas
Pendil, with Sst. 101 b., has a chance. Over goes Lord
Nolan therefore. Pendil is one of the few approved
stayers in the field. He would have won the Caulfield
Cup had the distance been 40yds. longer. He will meet
Blue Book on better terms over a course half a mile longer
than Caulfield Cup. Blue Book doesn’t look equal to a
two-mile journey, nor did he run like a genuine stayer the
other Saturday. Over goes Blue Book. Probably the
fragile Artillerie will outlast Mr. Williamson’s gigantic
steed at Flemington. Ungarie and Didus are a somewhat
difficult pair to discuss rationally'. The latter was not
suspected of stamina until he ran third in last Sydney
Cup to Trafalgar and Ungarie. He has been specially'
reserved for the Melbourne Cup and heavily backed.
His friends have great hopes; his enemies sum him up as
a leggy brute who is bound to be beaten by Ungarie and
others. Seeing that Ungarie is a better-looking horse,
‘•with a lot of the Trenton about him,” and is, in fact,
the best handicapped one in the race on his form with
Trafalgar last year this scribe favors the idea that he will
beat Didus again. So over goes Didus, along with
Flavinius, Flavel and Knox, who are doubtful stayers.
Knox, with his light weight, is bound to run very
prominently most of the time, all the same.
Of the rank outsiders that might turn up trumps,
Dunolly, half brother to Aurum and Auraria, is bred to
stay ; likewise Trelo Vouni, the good-looking 6-year-old
that ran fourth in Caulfield Cup and second in Moonee
Valley Cup last Saturday. Delaware’s claims to
consideration are a light weight and a capacity to
stay. He ran third to Lord Nolan and Tulkeroo
last year; but he is a bit more aged and not quite
so lightly weighted this year. Over goes Delaware. The
writer prefers King’s Cross, though it is not yet clear that
the son of Grafton and Crossfire can go a full two miles.
But King’s Cross stayed well enough to win the
V.R.C. Handicap (If miles) last November, and on that
form he is well handicapped at Bst. 31b. He should be
taken in any small lot to beat the field.
Now, without knocking down all the other
names the writer will reduce his fancies to six, viz.,
Trafalgar, Alawa, Pendil, King’s Cross, Ungarie,
and Prince Foote (or any three-year-old that looks better
than he on paper after the Derby). Of the top weights,
Alawa should beat Trafalgar if he can stay the full two
miles, but even if he beats him in the Melbourne Stakes
on Saturday the stamina of Alawa will not be
proved. On the other hand, should Trafalgar win the
Stakes, he will look certain to beat Alawa and Pendil in
the Cup. But to swear by Trafalgar without having “a
bit ”on Ungarie were absurd. The latter has run but one
race over two miles, and that was the best race of his life
thus far. Let,the tip then be —
Trafalgar .. .. ]
Ungarie .. .. .. ..2
Pendil 3
King’s Cross 4

Sydney Telegraph found another grievance
last week, and wailed thusly : “Queensland newspapers,
circulating in N.S.W., contain the ruling odds on the
Melbourne Cup. It is an offence for the papers pub-
lished in this State to print them.” Well, it was the work
of the Telegraph’s own pet Government; and it is in-
deed pleasing to find that its support to Jeremiah Wade
has rebounded and banged it on its owrf bullion.
T§e fees that the jockey receives paled into
insignificance when the racing chauffeur appeared on the
scene, but the motor man who bounds along the earth at
the rate of 100 or so miles per hour has in his turn sur-
rendered pride of costliness to the aeroplaner who soars
over it. The flying man demands and receives anything
from £lOOO to £2OOO per week for the actual aviation, and
then scoops in fancy fees for delivering lectures on how it
feels to fly. At Blackpool (England) this week, Lieu-
tenant Latham staggered along at the rate of five miles
an hour against a gale blowing at the rate of 40; and
then with a sudden swerve he mounted the blast and
flashed along at the rate of 90 miles an hour. When he
comes to tell how he felt during that amazing soar—that
cannon-ball flight—people will climb over each other to
get seats ;mnd probably come away disappointed when
they hear that, unless he looked at the earth below 7 , he
felt as though he w'ere quite still. It is doubtful even if
a glance at where he came from gave him much idea of
speed. He w'ould probably still feel that he was standing
still and that the earth had broken from its moorings and
bolted. The appearance of the Baroness de la Roche
at Chalons (France), w'here she flew over the big military
camp, suggests that the aeroplanist’s high fees will not
last long, \yherever the woman can butt in, the rate of
remuneration soon falls.

If there is one thing that the Automobile Asso-
ciation of Australia has set its face against it is the
road hog—the reckless criminal u'ho dashes headlong-
over country roads regardless of his own and everyone
else’s life. The other day a periodical entitled The
Motor in Australia made a bad blunder by publishing a
map of Sydney and its environs, showing the exact
locality of the 17 police traps which exist in and around
Sydney to catch road hogs. This sort of thing is
most deplorable. It is either a tacit accusation
that all the Sydney motorists are criminals or an
admission that The Motor in Australia is not in
sympathy with the action of the police in trying
to make the roads safe. Anyhow, it is calculated
to do motorists harm by bringing them into evil repute.
According to a recent decision in England it is illegal to
publish warnings to motorists as to where they may ex-
pect to find police traps. The traps are for the detection
of the guilty, and to publish their whereabouts is held
in England to be interfering with a police officer in the
execution of his duty. The Motor in Australia w ill be
well advised if it drops the publication of maps to assist
road hogs to escape detection.

Unless the übiquitous George Whatmore comes
along with one of those much-talked-of flyers he is always
threatening to produce, it looks as though the next race
in Sydney waters for the Australasian Motor Boat
Championship will be a walk over for Arthur Davies in
the Fairbanks. Victoria has frankly admitted that it has
nothing to hurl against the cedar boat, and Maoriland
will not compete even if it has anything that has a show.
So by all appearances the thing is a foregone conclusion.
There is a whisper that Whatniore is building a dark
horse—something unique that will astonish the natives ;
but ever since that alleged hydroplane the public is some-
what inclined to shake its leg when Whatmore talks
darkly in hidden meanings. The reason why it shakes
its leg is that it wants to see if Whatmore is hanging on
to the end of it.

Long and McLoughlin, the invading Yankees
who are after the Davis Cup, will arrive in Sydney by the
Aorangi on or about November 2. They' will streak on to
see Melbourne Gup, as their countrymen did on the last
occasion, after which they will settle down to three weeks’
hard practice, and on Nov. 26 commence the struggle for
the Cup at Sydney.
* * * * ■*
Apparently Maoriland has gone mad on scull-
ing. Auckland, Wanganui and Foxton all talk of
arranging big handicaps, with prizes which will make it
worth the while of any good sculler to trip along. If
the boom that is apparently coming but redeems half the
promise of its making, there will be a mighty exodus
from Australia very shortly.
But while Maoriland is howling of what it is
going to do, Perth is quietly’ negotiating for a race be-
tween Pearce and Day on the Swan River. Pearce’s re-
sponse is modest enough (a purse of £2OO and £25 for ex-
penses), and Day is hardly likely' to say’ anything more
exorbitant. So that match can be considered almost a
certainty.

The team sent to Brisbane by the N.S.W.
Cyclists’ Union to compete at the championships meeting
is a fairly strong one, consisting of P. Mutton, Cutliffe
and P. Shepherd. On form they should come back
loaded up with pewter and household furniture.

Munroe, who put up the fastest time in the
Warrnambool (Vic.) ride is a mere slip, weighing 81st.
He is only 21 years of age, and has already put up’an
amazing record of 20 fastest times, three firsts, 15 seconds
and nine thirds since 1906, when he started racing. He
was born at Warrnambool, within 20yds. of the starting
point of the great W.-M. ride.

N.S.W. League of Swimmers is bobbing up in
a style which is very disconcerting to the amateur body’.
Seven clubs are launched, also three ladies’ clubs are
affiliated ; and as each club records a good membership,
the struggles for the enclosures during the season pro-
mise to be interesting. The League opens with a gala on
November 10, when an inter-club handicap with a prize
of £5 and a gold medal will be dangled. The League is
promising its patrons big prize-money; and the Amateur
Swimming Ass. is consequently squatting around with its
head in vinegar.

The Oodnadatta to Adelaide homing pigeon-
race—subsidised (mildly) by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, with a view to possible helpfulness in war-time—
produced what is said to be a world’s record. There
were 281 starters, and the first bird was in his loft in
Southwark (an Adelaide suburb) in 7hrs. 49min. 46sec.
This means nearly’ a mile and a quarter, a minute for the
whole 644 miles.

A. B. Postle, the speedy Australian profes-
sional footrunner, met an unexpected reverse at
Wigan (Britain) this week. He was racing a Yankee
named llolway over 120yds., and bad the ’Murkan appa-
rently dead to the world. Apparently the Yankee ex-
ploded a tin of Chicago sausages under his heels, or some-
thing ; anyhow, with a sudden bound and spurt that, in
his apparent condition, seemed impossible, he passed
Postle and beat him by 18in. This ability to suddenly
sprint is the feature of the Yankee-manufactured sports-
man, and suggests that the Yankee methods of training
are superior. As the Yankee shows no objection to steal-
ing our patents, there seems to be no valid reason why
the Australian should not steal the Yankee’s training
methods. It isn’t much of a revenge, but still it is better
than nothing.

A feature of Melbourne Pennant cricket on
Saturday was the batting of Warne, of Carlton. Warne,
who smacked up 133 against University in the previous
match, this time knocked up 113 not-out against East
Melbourne, with the result that Carlton’s tally now
shows 246 for three wickets. Richmond compiled 158
against Fitzroy’, mostly by the unexpected scintillation of
a generally tired tail, and ’Roy responded softly with two
for 13. P’ran dismissed South Melbourne for 221, and then
occupied the crease long enough to wallop up six without
the loss of a single stick. Melbourne is graciously excused
for allowing University to* total 239, for it is evex*ywhere
admitted that the present Melbourne team is made up of
flannelled fools from assorted epochs. North Melbourne
is also pardoned for whacking up 257 for eight wickets
against such an amiable team as Northcote ; while Essen-
don’s generosity to Collingwood is cordially admired. It
permitted ’Wood to make 217, and as it has replied with
two wickets for four runs as a start, it evidently intends
that ’Wood shall win the match.
* * * *
Saturday saw the commencement of the third
round of Sydney first-grade cricket. It was the day of
the bat, and the posters of evening announced heavy-
scoring. Barnes, of Redfern, made 105 against Middle
Harbor; Johnston, of Gordon, totalled 103 ; but this was
easily surpassed by his club mate, Maclean, who carried
his bat against Petersham for 120. The boss batsman of
the day, however, was Pite, of Sydney, who smashed and
drove and slashed and banged till the figures stood at
137, and then Norman Deane clean bowled him. The
same bowler also got Pite’s colleague, Collins,
who had made 101 against North Sydney. Sydney’s
effort was a mighty one—3B6 runs for four wickets—and
was easily the best of the day. Gordon made 324 for six
wickets, Redfern totted up 305 for the whole innings,
Burwood had 203, and Paddington 174. Practically the
only bowler who illuminated the gloom was Connolly’, of
Central Cumberland, who took six Burwood wickets for
59 runs, although Norman Deane also did things. Only
four Sydney wickets fell. Two of them were caught by
Clarke off Deane, one was bowled directly by Deane, and
the other was caught by Deane off Proctor. So it will be
seen that Deane was in evidence.

Victor Trumpet, who seems to be developing a
habit of opening his head, howls that the trip to Britain
was a frost. Gross receipts, he says, will reach £13,500,
of which the Board of Control will take £1238, general
exes. £6OOO, .with a balance to each pla.ver of, roughly’,
about £392, out of which each man will have to pay his
laundry, etc. If What Trumper say’s of the exes, is true,
some inquiry should be held. In 1896, with 14 players,
the bills reached only 7 £3229, and the players drew about
£6OO each. Anyhow, what is wrong with the £392 ? How
many of the XI. would have made that sum in the same
time had they stayed in Australia and toiled?

The Victorian Cricket Ass. has once again
elected Peter McAlister as sole selector of the State team.
Mac., who doubtless does his best, has only one pair of
eyes, and therefore fails to note many things. The Ass.
yvould have been better advised to make the committee a
band of three or more.

C. G. Macartney, returning from his Austra-
lian XI. ramblings, goes to Otago (M.L.) as coach to the
local Cricket Association. There is more horse-sense in
the choice than in persevering with the foolish idea of
importing a player from England. C. Wordsworth (of
Sydney) also took up the “coach” position at Otago
recently.
When Squires bumped Lang at Me d j y
Cyclorama building- on Monday night, it was *
believed for a while that “ Boshter Bill' had at
back his lost punch. Before the fight it was n g
Lang ; but after the first few rounds they were s ,
odds on Squires. William S. was fighting a great ,
leading magnificently, and landing freely .j
siderable steam on William L. At the 19th round itse
impossible that he could be beaten, and offers of 111 t
on him found no takers. The market was talking
vengeance. He had been braced up with oxygen l
17th department of the struggle, and seemed capaD
going on for quite a long while. And then the rui
effect that follows the use of dopes was seen, i
beginning of the 20th round he suddenly fizzled •
He collapsed utterly, and while he tried to recover n *
self he was uppercut on the mouth, concussed in
stomach, and banged over the head. William S. trie
clinch, but William L. stood off and uppercut him twi •
Down went Squires and another count out saw his iat
effort fail. All the same, Lang was unusually lucky, ri
Squires really recovered his lost punch there we
half a dozen times when Lang was done and should h
been outed. In Squires’ corner Tahmmy Burns bellowed C
him to go in and finish his reeling opponent; but eitn
the gong went or Squires failed to get enough steam into
the attempted coup de grace. The present champion or
Australia owes his retention of the title to the fact that
his opponent didn’t know how to follow up his oppor-
tunity and finish him off.

Champion pug Jack Johnson is indulging in a
scrap in the law courts. When he was at Salt Lake City,
recently, one of his white minions engaged rooms at a
high-class hotel for “ Mr. and Mrs. Johnson,” while the
champion and his spouse went along to where the cullud
population gave him a royal welcome. When the last
beaker was empty and dry and the night was far
advanced, Johnson and his missus tooted up to the door
of the pub, where the landlord barred the way. He had
understood that the rooms had been taken for white
people, and his hotel never catered for colored pussons
under any circumstances. To admit them meant that
every white person would march out in the morning, and
Johnson must go elsewhere. Johnson did. He drove to
the police station, but the Mormon John Dunns declined
to interfere, and where Johnson put in the night is not
known. Next day he started an action, claiming $25,000
damages.

Young Tom Turner, a recent graduate from the
novice ranks, proved his mettle against Bob Greenshields
in a 20-round contest at Ballarat the other night. The
public brought much grist to the “ mill,” and the plugging
apprentice waded in to remove the scalp of his experi-
enced opponent. But Greenshields is a recognised expert
who has dealt, more or less successfully, with the best
Australia has made in his class, and he succeeded in keep-
ing out of the way of Turner’s vigorous belts and biffs,
although he quite failed to make the youngster look cheap
and easy at any stage of the game. Greenshields won on
points. The fact that he did not succeed in stopping
Turner is a badge of honor for the boy who was nominally
defeated.

The coming month will complete the cycle of 21
years since the advent of the Dunlop pneumatic tyre.
And what changes it has wrought 1 Writer can remember
roaming round Maoriland on a solid-tyred high machine,
and being acclaimed as something a little less than a god,
only to have jeers flung at him six months later when he
visited the same locality on what was then termed a
“ safety ” —the thing was regarded as “ effeminate ”
also on solid tyres. In those days a machine had to
weigh at least 351 b. to stand the strain and shock the
solid tyres were unable to absorb. Then one day came a
stranger on a weird-looking contraption that seemed to
have rims as large as a buggy wheel; and he bounded as
no other bikist ever bounded before. He explained it
was a pneumatic tyre, and it was called the “Boothroyd
Scorcher,” but he said it had a habit of coming off,
and he was going in for one called “the Dunlop”
which was fastened to the rim of the machineby cemented
cloth. We were interested. Then came another strang r,
fresh from Britain, and his machine had the Clincher
tyre. He was booking orders, and he went away from
the' country town with a full book. Then the Dunlop
arrived at last. It is still here. Boothroyd Scorchers,
Clinchers, Raleighs and the rest have all gone. No one
hears of them now—they are like Nineveh and Tyre, and
also John Brown.
MORNING GALLOPS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The middle grass track was rather holding this morn-
ing, though several fast gallops were recorded.—Train-
ing note.
Oh 1 the gallops !
Morning gallops !
Those fast, press-recorded gallops 1
Oh ! what does the punter profit from the gallops in the
dawn ?
When the fav’rites and outsiders
With their flogging, spurring riders
Thunder past the staring grandstand and the packed and
anxious lawn ;
And a thing that couldn’t gallop worth a tinker’s in the
morning
Is seen coming up like blazes on the outside of the field,
Casting dirt on odds-on chances and their jockeys’ silk
adorning
With the flying clod of insult which the flying hoof doth
yield.
Oh 1 the gallops 1
Early gallops !
Those exciting, misty gallops !
You remember them with curses when you see the
fav’rite flag,
And the rank outsider flying
By his side while he is trying
Like a plucky, beaten equine to break from the rival nag ;
’Twas the fav’rite did the gallops in the dark and frostt'
morning,
And he split the precious seconds into fragments with his
heels ;
But that blanky Cold Molasses that was frozen with his
scorning,
Melts away in front and beats him to the Ring’s trium-
phant squeals.
Oh ! the gallops !
Fatal gallops!
Oh 1 put not thy trust in gallops,
I 1 or the stop-watch is a mocker and the training track a
snare !
’Tis the race, O gentle backer,
Where the pace is made a cracker—
'Tis the race that tells the story when the dust clouds fill
the air!
Then the silken jackets streaming past the batteries of
glasses
Show the morning stop-watch winner toiling madly in
the ruck,
And he’s still right in amongst it when the storm of
horseflesh passes
Where the boxed-in judge is waiting. Then you mutter,
"Just my luck t"
Oh 1 the gallops !
Morning gallops !
Do you read about the gallops?
Tell me, friend, are you a student of the cinders and the
tan?
Do you carefully remember
In October and November,
When Disaster and Delusion were amongst the “ also
ran ” ?
Do you strew their hopeless furlongs with the cash for
which you sweated ?
Do you cry aloud in anger when they’re given too much
weight ?
If you do, O simple Punter, it is much to be regretted,
Eor you’re doing your fast gallop towards the Old-Age
Pension fate.

Sydney Daily Whiskeks bristled with
surprise the other morning regarding “Alderman
Meagher’s peculiar statements of the effects of
‘golden ointment’ in ‘ chloroforming ’ municipal
representatives of the city in relation to certain
contracts,” and, when it had closed the window
on its beard to keep it out of the ink,
it said that the whole thing was “an
interesting mystery anyhow, and ought to be
cleared up.” But why does the Telegraph itself
not findjout the answers to the string of questions
it emptied into the four winds of King-street as to
who was chloroformed and gold-filled, and why,
and wherefore, and whaffor? Does it ex-
pect the ointment-smeared aldermen to leave
their cards, or that Richard Denis will de-
posit the heads of the grafters on the office-
counter ? Probably Richard wondered what
had fallen on him when he saw his golden grease
statement in the Stak, because he had made his
references at what was supposed to he a private,
meeting of the King division of the P.L.L. The
advertisement that Richard sought was from
quite a different medium than the newspapers,
but it so happened that a pressman mistook the
door of the hall for the back entrance to a pub,
and walked in to purchase a hot pie. When he;
recovered from the shock of his mistake, he found
.the noble Roman making his oration. Next day
the noble Roman was the shocked person, and
after that the learned Dr. Ward of the Telegraph
was shocked, and the public was shocked, and
things in general were shocked.

Continental Square Tread Tyres
The new season’s Model de Course Square Tread Tyres are now here, and in the
quality of fabric, quality of rubber, and quality of workmanship are ahead of any
other tyre in the world.
The new “ Square Tread ” is the ideal tyre for touring purposes, and not
only contains a higher grade of rubber, but is heavier in weight than any similar
tyre known to the motoring world.
Continental Three-Rib Tyres
The new Continental three-rib Tyres mark a new standard of excellence in non-
skids, and in a series of severe tests on Australian roads have given the fullest
satisfaction.
The quality of rubber, the workmanship, the hard wearing qualities of these
tyres are giving satisfaction to every motorist who is using them.
These tyres carry the most liberal of all guarantees —the guarantee of
complete satisfaction.

AT THE ANTARCTIC.
Commander E. H. Shackleton, R.N., states:
“ We used Plasmon preparations continually during: the
National Antarctic Expedition, and one of our sledging
parties practically lived on Plasmon.”
Mr. Douglas Mawson, lecturer of Adelaide University, says:
“Of all the foods, the Plasmon foods were used mostly—
Plasmon Biscuits, Plasmon Cocoa, and Plasmon"itself.
Dr. Marshall, Medical Officer of the Expedition, states :
“ Plasmon Biscuits and Plasmon Cocoa were of tremendous
value.”
Plasmon is an unequalled NERVE & BRAIN FOOD, con-
taining the Organic SALTS and PHOSPHORUS of MILK.

The Dr. J. A. Sherman Method
Will Cure Your Rupture!
For your own sake and for the sake of those dependent on you,
you should make an earnest effort to overcome that terrible rupture.
To let it take its course is to run thfe risk of more severe affliction and
possibly premature death.
The Dr. J. A. Sherman Method has cured hundreds of severe
ruptures, even in people of advanced age, and your case is not without
hope. Read what one man says about the treatment :
Porthmear House, Walnut Avenue, Ashburton, N.Z.,
January 26th, 1909.
Dear Sir,
Just a line to tell you that I went to the doctor the other day to set
examined for life insurance, and, of course, he had to examine the rupture.
He said it was perfectly sound, but, owing' to insurance rules, I would have
to wear the appliance a little longer yet. Thanks to Dr. Sherman’s Treatment,
I feel as sound and strong there now as I do in any other part of my body.
I remain, dear sir, yours respectfully,
PHILLIP CHOAK.
Consultations are free, and we will he glad to give you very
definite proof of the efficacy of the treatment. Country sufferers
should take a day or two off and arrange a visit. If you cannot call
send for two books containing details and proof of the Sherman Method.
HOURS: —Daily (Sundays excepted), 10 a.m. to 12 noon ; 2 p.m. to

Business. Robbery, etc.
A Portarlington (Vic.) fisherman netted ]os.
for a week’s work in catching and marketing: over 20
baskets of fish. It was such a herring-gutted return that
the fisherman decided to trawl the mystery on his own
account. He hadn’t grot far before he learnt that one
day, when fish was abundant, only 10 baskets were put up
for auction out of 185 that came in. The rest were put in
the cool stores, and at a later favorable opportunity were
unloaded at from 10s. to 14s. apiece. As his fish were
amongst these stored lots, the Portarlington man natu-
rally expected a decent return; but this is where the
auctioneer came in. He was not only an auctioneer, but
a dealer. He had bought the whole consignment at an
average of 25., and of course he collared the proceeds
when they realised 10s. or 14s. ; so he merely paid the
fisherman' 2s. per basket, less commission, freight,
cartage, dues, etc. The fisherman dropped his inquiries
just there and had a conversation with a lawyer ; but the
lawyer assured him that the Melbourne councillors and
the seven aldermen had already investigated the mat-
ter and found that the market methods were the very
acme of excellence, and it really wasn’t any use talking
Law on the subject.
• ■* • *
“Anti Melbourne has now an “ice manu-
facturers’ association,” which, if it isn’t a ring, or trust,
or combine, or other swindle of the sort, is at any rate
one of those “horrible understandings” which squeeze
the public just as dry. It’s a wonderful business, this ice-
making, if its “properly handled”—that is to say, if the
public is parcelled out like so many lambs to the various
butchers. A ton of water is worth 3d., yet the lowest
that the ring permits ice to be sold at is 255. net per ton, at
the works, and only at that price to a few individuals called
“ vendors.” Other people pay 355. to 40s. net. Car-
riage is extra. Now, the'value of the plant in an ice
wbrks is not more than in a saw mill, flour mill, engi-
neers’shop, foundry, or many another industry capable
of turning over the same amount of money annually:
also the wages paid are not so good, and the number of
employees is much smaller. Yet look at the relative cost
of the raw material to the manufactured product. Then
bear in mind that the ice factory runs seven days a
week and 24 hours a day, just like the interest on a
mortgage. It is a matter of common knowledge that in
Melbourne all the ice works are extending their plants,
although they had a “bad summer.” But 1 wouldn’t
mind that if, with very few exceptions, they didn’t im-
port nearly all their machines, although there are works
in Australia turning out plant quite as good, and for the
same purpose. It may be a shade dearer ; but who can
wonder at that when the workmen’s cost of living is put
up by such “ horrible understandings ” as this ? And, of
murse, it isn’t the only one. In fact, the “ Ice Manufac-
turers’Association ” has a twin-brother who looks after
the frozen meat trade, and keeps our own beef and
mutton prices high by glutting the foreign markets.
Bowen (Queensland) fruit growers are out after
Bowen shipper, as a test, split his weekly consignment
into two lots of 33 cases each. And although th fru
each lot wag exactly the same, one agent returned -s. 6d.
a case, and the other Is. 3d. The agent who sent ■ g
the low-priced
agent complained that the consignment was over-npe and
wet. The complaint was accompanied by a fervent op
W
ripeness aiid wetness. The Bowen Fruit-growers’ Asso-
ciation now reckons that if other North Bananaland fruit-
growers combine with them in sending a trustworthy
checktnan to watch the slippery agent, there 1
good margin out of the savings, even after paying i/iie
checkinan’s hotel and cigar expenses.

The practical purchased the Australian Alliance
Assurance Office by the London and Lancashire is calcu-
lated t 0 make the former’s employees think deeply over
their p 0S jtj O n. The Alliance has always been reputed a
liberal employer, but the London and Lancashire has
successfully resisted any aspersion of the sort. It is said
that its lavishness might excite a Chow to envy, but
this writer has never got any Chow’s opinion on the
smhippt Tn short amon"’ insurance men generally, tne
L and L. is described as a poor employer. Possibly the
a.. A. men have nothing to fear in the way of the sack, or
any sudden amputation of their respectable salaries : but
they can probably expect to gaze at their occasional
increments without being dazzled by their brilliance.
And when they pass out the L. and L. will most likely
regret their loss with something like this: —
p , „„
"YyANTED a hoy for 'csurari handwriting
school preferred. Applj f ‘ fe
to Bountiful.
which may sound like sarcasm, bub isn’t intended to
he. The London and Lancashire does not mind employ,
j n g- a hoy now and again, and indeed usually prefers him
t 0 a baby in arms.

‘ Ivin man s Man : lin going to be rather open
to the chaff bestowed on beermaker Nick Fitzgerald,
when he said that Australia’s great need was a nice light
ale. The problem now is to get beef to Europe. It is
Australia’s misfortune that we cannot do it unless, we
freeze it. We are just a. little outside the zone or radius,
The Argentine sends chilled beef to London. The United
States can send any quantity. We cannot send a single
cargo. An Australian in London goes into ecstasies over
the grand English beef, and is coolly told it is from
Chicago or La Plata. The best is, of course, sent alive. A
Briton never sings “ Oh, the Old English Roast Mutton!”
Beef, beef, all the time. Get Australian beef there, and
it is one step towards solving the Northern Territory
problem. That territory can carry two million bullocks
and ten million sheep, in addition to its more powerful
virtues in cotton, coffee, sugar, rice, etc. Get beef to
England, and Australia can be bulloclced to its utmost
capacity. The beef man’s mouth waters as he sees the
careless way in which sheep carcases are tossed about at
Sydney or Melbourne wharves and London docks. Beef
is the delicate article—not to be frozen like mutton, only
chilled. I have not the slightest doubt that the problem
will be solved. Lookback to the troubles and triumphs
of Mort, and take heart to try and try again.
RUNNING THE CUTTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The position of the Dominion is entirely different.—
Maoriland press item.
We are different and very much superior—
Oh, the spuds in our yard grow green—
The prospect that allures is much cheerier
As long as J. Ward can raise a bean.
We’re not drunk yet, though getting beerier,
While Cohen fills ’em up and isn’t mean.
Yes, decidedly prosperity will come again—
Oh, the spuds in our yard grow high—
And whenever our affairs are looking rum again
We’ll face them with a Dreadnought eye,
Send Ward to the British pub to bum again
When the credit and the cash run dry.
He will always run the cutter to the Jew again—
Oh, our spuds in the dew are wet! —
He is always very ready to renew again
Any pleasant little circumstance of debt.
We will borrow, borrow, borrow till all’s blue again ;
We’re superior and different, you bet !

The popularity of the BEALE PIANO is strongly evidenced by the fact that our factory output
is Three of these splendid instruments every four hours, and their High Quality is attested by the awards
of four separate juries and the Grand Jury of the Eranco-British Exhibition, London, 1908, of the
GRAND PR/TX for tonal quality and general excellence -
DIPLOME y D’ HONNEUR for iron and steel work, having special regard
to the Beale-Vader Patent Steel tuning system which is used
exclusively in our Pianos, and is beyond comparison superior to
the wooden system of imported Pianos.
TWO GOLD MEDALS for excellence of workmanship and perfection of
organisation for the production of the Beale Pianos.
There are more than 12,000 Beale Pianos in use, and the demand for them continues without abatement.
Indeed we are at present making very large additions of buildings and plant to our Eactorv to enable us
to more fully cope with the development of our business. These facts are positive assurance to intending
buyers that our Pianos are of high quality throughout, and will give entire satisfaction. We have the
written testimony of thousands of customers in proof of that, and the abovementioned awards are the
crowning endorsement of such testimony.
Before deciding to buy, call and see the Pianos in our Showrooms, or if that is not convenient, write
to us for one of our Catalogues, showing the Pianos in their natural colors, and we shall immediately
post it to you. We supply our Pianos on easy terms where desired, and take old Pianos in part
payment at a fair valuation.

ril HE grass grows green on the Plains of
Peace, and the breeze goes gently by,
And the boss o’ the plains goes drowsing
around with content in his full, fat eye.
The sheep says “ Ma-a-a ! ” on the Plains of Pence,
in a manner serene and kind,
For the tucker is plentiful all around, and there’s
nought to distract its mind ;
And the boss sits down, when the evening comes,
to a pipe in his old armchair.
And his heart rejoiceth, his soul is glad, and he
knoweth no want nor care ;
lor the sunshine blesses the owner’s toil, and the
profits come sure and soon
On the Plains of Peace, where the sheep and the
boss are the lords of the golden noon.
The grass grows green on the Plains of Peace—
and there ought to be men there, too ;
There ought to be men, and the sounds of toil and
a township or two on view,
And there ought to be women and kids about—
these certainly should abound
In the land of promises unperformed, in the places
of peace profound ;
Not peace and sheep, but men and noise, and
ploughs on the Plains of Peace,
And a fair, square deal for the cheap, plain hand
and his cheap, plain elbow-grease ;
Vnd the farmer must some day plant his hoofs
where at present the farmer’s not,
On the Plains of Peace where the sheep is god.
“To Hell with the farmers ! ” What .?
The boss of his own sheep-universe is great on
the Plains of Peace,
And he spends his days in a slow, calm, sure pur-
suit of the golden fleece ;
The boss of a hundred thousand sheep, and of
laborers nine or ten,
He suffers from plain, swelled head, and feels a
prince among mere paid men ;
And night after night far jumbucks bleat, and the
noise of them fills the earth,
And the boss lies warm in his lavendered sheets
and calculates what they’re worth ;
And there’s hard, cheap toil for the few that toil,
and gold for the few that don’t,
On the Plains of Peace where the big boss might
do wonderful things—but won’t !

Some Absurd Matrimonial Complications.
lhe case of Mrs. Jones, who might really be
Payne, or who might be partly Jones and partly
ij yne ’ arose laist w «ek in Queensland. It was an
old, old trouble, or' the tail-end of one. Thirty-
six years ago Catherine Kiley married Edward
Payne in N.S.W, Twenty-eight years ago she
got a decree nisi— which is usually half a divorce
—against him in Queensland ; but she never
applied for the decree absolute, which is usually
Hie other half of the divorce.
Tn *s seems to have left her
half-Payne. Twenty-four
years ago, the lady who was
apparently half-Payne mar-
ried Reuben Jones. Appar-
ently something happened
to Jones, for one year ago he
applied in N.S.W. to have
his marriage declared null
and void, on the ground
that Mrs. Jones was really
Mrs. Payne, and had been
so. all along. He won his
case, and the lady became
Mrs. Payne again—in
N.S.W. anyhow. Then she
fled to Queensland, and
asked for a decree absolute
to finish her unfinished
divorce of 28 years ago,
and she got that. It would
seem that in Queensland
the decree absolute isn’t so
necessary as in some other
places, and the Queensland
Court was willing to regard
it as the mere formal completion
of a matter which had, even 28
years ago, been complete enough to
answer all the reasonable requirements
of Jones. Having thus, in 1909, got her
Queensland divorce of 1881 made com-
plete and regular, the lady is nowin a
position to he legally married —or to have
been legally married—to Reuben Jones
in N.S.W. in 1885, but how far that
affects the circumstance that her marriage
with Jones was annulled in N.S.W. in
1908 it is hard to say, Apparently in
N.S.W. the lady isn't married at all, the
N.S.W. view being that her marriage with
P ly.rie was annul <1 inßnsbanein 1909,, and thatshe
was never really married to Jones at any time. In
Queensland the law holds that she is married to
.tones; ,that she was sufficiently divorced from
Payne in 1881 to enable her to legally wed Jones
in 1885 ; and that the cancellation of the Jones
marriage in N.S.W. is null and void. Being Mrs.
Jones in one State and not in the other, her
status, if she sat on the allegedly rabbit-proof
border fence, is a difficult question. Her status
in Victoria or Westralia is also a difficult ques-
tion. Plainly it is time the Commonwealth took
over the whole marriage and divorce business, so
that a person will either be wholly Jones or not
Jones at all. Meanwhile any correspondence
intended for this lady had better be addressed to
“Mrs. Partly-Jones.”

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, October 23, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
There seems some chance of our getting a full-
fledged Governor to ourselves again. Sir William
Macgregor and Lady Mac and certain members of
the family are afloat upon the Orsova, which is
due to tie up at Pinkenba on December 2. As his
Ex. has a well-developed taste for Papuan heat
he will probably feel good here, and wear his sun
hat with a rakish air. Lieut, the Hon. H. R.
Scarlet (whose name suggests a Past, but who is
probably merely a member of the Baron Abinger
brood) has been selected to wear a white-fronted
suit and be bored in general.
What a terrible tale is that which was hurled at
the Pioneer Club women by the Courier this
week. According to that biased publication, the
Pioneers’ hilarity completely upset, and other-
wise interfered with, the enjoyment of some 30
plumbers who were holding a smoke gathering on
the lower floor of the Eschenhagen Cafe. Now to
my personal knowledge there are hundreds of
otherwise peaceable citizens all over the
civilised world who simply ache to dis-
concert even one plumber, having
suffered untold misery at the hands
of the whole plumb tribe ; so to
get nigh two-score of them in
one room and make them all
miserable for two hours is
a feat. Bricklayers, car-
penter s, stonemasons,
blacksmiths and the like
are brethren ; but the
plumber, the pawnbroker
and the undertaker are
outside the pale, or ought
to be. Never yet did I
have a water-pipe repaired
by a plumber who didn’t
leave a worse leak behind
Inin. Now I get any unavoidable plumbing done
by a shoemaker and a broken-down actor, and the
results are satisfactory.
After all this exordium I learn with grief that
the Pioneers didn’t harass any plumbers. First
of all, the Pioneers hadn’t any music to annoy
plumbers, with ; second, there were no plumbers
there to be annoyed. The gathering was a birth-
day party.
A closer acquaintance with the Widow Beilairs
brings out strongly the fine work of Miss Eosslyn
Vane ;is the weepful Julia, and Mr. Conway
Wingfield as O’Hara. The former further im-
proved this pleasant impression in “Sweet Nell ”
as the Lady Olivia. King Charles 11., in the
person of Mr. Claude King, fell off his horse, or.
as he modestly put it during a brief explanation
in the first interval, he dismounted hurriedly on
top of a stone. The result was a strained ankle, a
limp, and a pain in the high-heeled shoe.
Touching the stage, the Lang-Meason lady
writes me from the wilds of Bundaberg to say
that Walter Bentley’s northern barnstorm has
been successful, and that “Hamlet” has got
through without a scratch. The co. strikes this
city for exactly two hours on Thursday on its
tumultuous way south.
The Day and Knight co. also drops a line from
a town called Timaru, in the Lord’s Own Place.
Its members seem impressed by the talkative-
ness of the legislators, and by the character of the
tea supplied by that verbose body on the day when
the laundry opened for soiled” political finery.

and declined. The money was strong upon Cribb,
of the coal-mining Bundamba electorate, while
Petrie, Forsyth, the recovered Tolmie, and Mac-
artney were all howling. To give the thing away
was to make at least half a dozen enemies, so the
Kid has decided to leave well alone, and the work
is to be divided between Barnes and Appel. Some
people say that the reason the chief Kid is steer-
ing so clear of making appointments is that he is
out on a little matter of the kind for himself in
London town, though it seems an unreasoning sort
of a reason.

These are the remains. It is through, this district

The sad news comes from the Great Fog that
Mrs. George Warry, who, as Miss Lizzie Heal,
was so well known in social circles here, lies ill in
a London hospital, with very little hopes of ulti-
mate recovery. The Warrys have been honey-
mooning for the last five months.
The Milk Institute is in the mud as regards
funds, and the worried committee finds itself con-
fronted with a monthly deficit of something like
£2O. Now the Institute, the last legacy of Lady
Chelmsford, is doing good work. According to a
prominent physician, it is saving more lives than
any hospital. Yet the municipal body is evidently
satisfied to see it break down rather than supply
the £240 to set it on its legs again. In Melbourne
the municipal folk shell out twice as much.
The rush of immigrants to this State is becoming
awful, and very soon the place will be as the turret

Italian, and the accumulated aroma of sourkrout,
garlic, green soup, vodka and macaroni beats the
band.-
The city fathers have passed the sketch plans
of the Town Hall after much vituperation, and
unless there is another row inside of seven weeks
there is imminent danger of the foundation stone
being laid with the name of a defeated candidate,
Thos. Wilson, thereon.
Sincerely yours,
MARIO.
The other day the newly elected member
for Fassifern (Q.), Arnold Wienholt, staggered his
constituents by presenting one year’s Parlia-
mentary salary, £3OO, to a local hospital. A wild
ptean of jubilation rang through the Queensland
press. For many years the Weinholt Estates Co.
held the Marvvale and Fassifern stations back
from settlement, and thereby retarded the pro-
gress of two most important districts for the best
part of a generation. Recently a paternal Govern-
ment purchased Mary vale at a generous figure, and
that estate was immediately bought up at prices
ranging from £3 to £l3 per acre. Recently also
Fassifern was cut up and went off like hot cakes.
It is thus quite understandable how Wienholt can
afford to give £3OO to a local hospital. The piti-
ful part of the business is that the local farmers
imagine they’ve struck a Peabody in the politician
who has just handed over the paltriest fraction of
the wealth the Wienholt Co. levied as a toll
on the industry of Southern Queensland. It is
alleged that the donor above mentioned does not
believe in payment of members —hence the gift of
£3OO, But surely the man who buys popularity
with £3OO of his Parliamentary salary is using the
money of the State for his own advantage just as
much as the man who spends it on beef and clothes
and bread and butter. If a candidate for Parlia-
mentary honors made a donation of £3OO to some
institution in his constituency a week before the
election a very harsh term might be applied to
the proceeding, and yet the donating of the sum a
week after the last election and three years before
the next one may be done with the same intention
and may have the very same effect.
When Lennon won the Herbert seat from
Cowley, three years ago, it was put down as an
accident; and, partly because he has dodged about
a good deal, it was reckoned that he wouldn’t stay
long in Herbert. Yet he put up a good fight this
time, and hung on. Thirty years or so back young
Lennon was handing out groceries in a Stawell
(Vie.) store. Then he wanted to sample Mel-
bourne, and got a billet in the Mines Department,
Brough Smyth was the fierce old tyrant there—
Smyth, whose bitter tongue was known to make
grown men weep, and who drove even a
Government department to such fierce revolt at
last that he had to be suspended in order to avert,
a general stoppage—and when the historiealinquiry
came along, Lennon was one of the witnesses who
damned him. After that he joined the
Bank of Australasia. E. S. Parkes was
superintendent then —just about the ablest
banker and the greatest autocrat who ever
sat in a general-manager’s chair in Australia.
Parkes, who was killed afterwards in the Windsor
railway accident, had most of his officers crouch-
ing to him, and despised them when they did it.
Lennon didn’t, so the “old man” picked him
out to open up business at Townsville. From the
bank he passed over to Burns, Philp, but he
quitted that, of course, before he burst forth as a
Laborite. When his party ‘‘ arrives ” the finan-
cial experience of Lennon, ex-bank manager and
ex-bank director, ought to come in handy.


MODEL FARMS AND SUGAR.
A wonderful sugarcane district— Marburg—exists
within a few miles of Brisbane.
There the hill tops are covered with flourishing
cane, above the level of the frosts.
'The forest giants are being displaced by the thick

Young cane is seen growing amongst the stumps
of the newly-cut trees.
tn this district the traveller will find a flourishing
settlement of thrifty Germans, who are
fortunate in having chosen one of the

•rOKTUNES IN SUGAR.—V.
A. GLANCE at the kind
of country available in
Queensland, and the inducements to cane plant-
ers. Take Rosewood and Fassifern, in Southern
Queensland. At Marburg, near the main line
connecting Brisbane and Sydney, a sugar mill has
been in existence for 15 years. Started as a
private concern, it is now owned by the Marburg
Sugar Company, and it has been fitted with the
latest machinery and appliances. It has a capacity
for crushing and treating 1200 tons of cane per
week. The district around Rosewood is devoted
to mixed farming. Coffee flourishes there.
Dairying is the backbone of the place, and cane
growing can be advantageously combined with
dairying, as the tops of the cane make good fodder
for cattle. On this piece of Queensland’s territory,
which a few years ago was covered by the primeval
jungle, the land is employed all the year round in
raising alternate crops—grapes, maize, lucerne,
oats, potatoes, cotton, sugarcane ; and these are
, combined with bee culture, grazing and a timber
- industry. The material and productive side is
, the one which naturally appeals to the prospective
I emigrant. But much could be written upon tne
tbeautiful scenery of this district, its rolling hills
. and distant mountains, its patches of forest, left
: standing picturesquely when the scrub was
‘“banished” More, too, could be written about
tthe climate, the beautiful mildness of the
winter, which makes all the sugar regions, from
smith to north, health resorts for Sydney, Mel-
bourne and Tasmanian
folk in the bleak south-
ern days.
I was through this
district in June last,
having been taken
through by Mr. Denis
Keogh, member for the
district in the Queens-
land Parliament. After
leaving Ipswich we soon
found ourselves among
the picturesque farms
of the German settlers
of Marburg. The day
was clear with soft
sunshine over every-
thing — and we were
snugly wrapped up in thick overcoats for the pur-
pose of accommodating ourselves to the “ unen-
durable heat ” of Queensland. A lovely cold
•breeze blew in our faces. Its effect was perceptible
,jn the nice complexions of the children and the
-women. On either side of the road were beautiful
ifarms, showing maize and lucerne side by side,
with occasionally a pumpkin patch, the deep
yellow of the ripened rinds of the pumpkin gourds
(contrasting with the light yellow of the sugar
rat toons and the green stalks of the young corn.
Hear the dam which was constructed to supply
Ithe surrounding district we found the Public
School, and at our request the teacher made the
scholars troop out into the sunshine to have their
photographs taken. A fine, sturdy, happy-looking
lot of children they were—boys and girls; and if
the future of Australia is dependent upon its
Ibirth rate, it can be safely said that so far as the
Marburg district is concerned that future is
perfectly safe.
All round us were undulating hills, and as we
looked -westward were the dark-blue peaks of the
Main Range, with Cunningham’s Gap clearly dis-
tinguishable from the neighboring gorges. In this
district the sugar is grown on the hill-sides to
.escape the frost. In the very centre of things is
the mill, and above on the crest of the hill is
the residence of Mr. Gibson, the manager of the
anill. From the verandah of the Gibsons’ house a
•magnificent view of the surrounding country may
Hje obtained. Hot far from this point a branch

and the ships. One of the striking scenic features
of the district is Tallegalla Hill, on the summit of
which two fig trees have been left standing.
These constitute a landmark for miles and miles
around. The soil is rich, and is capable of grow-
ing anything. So far as the intrinsic beauty of
the landscape is concerned, I have never seen
anything to excel it in the landscapes of Britain,
France, Germany or Austria, Passing along the
toad we met the pastor and his wife in a good,
substantial buggy ; and, further on, the typical
German waggons, with their ribbed sides, aniid
the other surroundings, reminded me of certain
parts of Westphalia or the Valley of the Drave in
Austria.
We find another typical sugar region in the
Mackay District, at the other extreme of the
great State—in North Queensland. This area
also offers a hearty welcome to the man or the
family who come along and take up sugar-growing.
The anxiety of the present settler is to have his
district developed. The more new-comers of the
right sort, the better for him ; and he knows this,
and is prepared to do everything to make the
emigrant comfortable, not, as he avows, from any
sentimental or philanthropic motives, but
out of pure business reasons. The spirit of
the dwellers in this district is expressed in these
words :
Our people have a splendid
district, which they wish to
see developed to its utmost
capacity; and they invite
intending settlers in Queens-
land to come along and
throw in their lot with
them and share and share
alike the glorious inherit-
ance which the pioneers of
the district discovered for
them.
There are in this dis-
trict 142 square miles
of Crown lands open
to selection at an aver-
age price of 15s. per
acre. There is the
chance for the man of
small capital; and when
this quantum is taken up, more will be
available. “ This,” says an official pub-
lication, “is all on the coast side of the
range, and varies in distance from town from
27 to 45 miles. Much of the land is within easy
access of the tramlines belonging to the various
sugar mills in the district. A new road, recently
constructed to the Eungella Tableland, has made
accessible large quantities of merchantable tim-
bers and acres of rich Crown land.” In this
region, too, dairying could be made to flourish
exceedingly; but King Butter gives way to
King Sugar in this royaume, for the latter
is monarch; and it says much for the
attractiveness and for the lucrative nature
of cane-planting that dairying is neglected.
Later on, doubtless, these two, with other
sources of wealth, will be developed side by
side.
Another phase of the ad vantages of this district
is pointed out in these words :
There are 10 large sugar factories actively operating,
with capacities from 4000 to 8000 tons sugar, most of
them controlling steam tramway systems totalling 200
miles in length. It is worthy of note that of the
11 mills built in various parts of (Queensland bv Gov-
ernment loan money, one of the Mack ay Central
Mills—the Racecourse—was the first, to repay in
full, out of its profits, the amount borrowed for
its construction.
In 1907 this district
produced 41.430 tons
of sugar from a thou-
sand farms, and upon
this tVie bounty from
the Federal Govern-
ment amounted to
£122,590 in that year.
To produce this
amount of sugar
350.432 tons of cane
were raised, and the
average price paid
the farmer for the
cane was 12s. fld. per
ton, equal to £219,020.
The value of the
sugar produced in this one district alone in
the year was £580,738.' The official guide-book
makes this significant statement :
The half-million pounds’ worth of sugar, equalling a pro-
ducing value of £5OO per farm, was the product of a
thousand farmers, fully three-fourths of whom came to
the district as agricultural laborers.
And not only is the immense area of Crown
land referred to above available, but private
estates which have been used for grazing and
other purposes, or have lain idle, have been
cut up, and can be had by the small
capitalist at from 15s. to as high as £l2
per acre. Enough has been said to outline
the prospects of the settler in this, which
will some day be one of the richest of the staple
industries of Queensland. If wool is in universal
demand to-day, so is sugar. If dairying can make
the fortune of a nation as well as the individual,
so can sugar. Not only is it the primary pro-
ducer who is benefited by the growth of a great
industry like this, suited to the climate and the
soil of a vast territory. Here again in this, as in
the other industries described, the workers, the
tradespeople, the hundred and one enter-
prises which depend upon the establish-
ment and successful maintenance of a great
national industry, are benefited, and through
all the veins of the nation’s industrial
life the wealth created in the sugar in-
dustry pulsates, and the results are woven in
the web and woof of the material and com-
mercial development of the State and Common-
wealth.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
CATARRH is inflammation of the lining-
membrane of the nose and adjoining-
passages. If this inflammation is not ar-
rested it invades the passages which lead
from the nose to the head, ears, throat and
lungs. It injures the sight and hearing,
destroys the sense of taste and smell, ren-
ders the breath offensive, breaks down
the affected tissues, and consumes the
nasal cartilages. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and stomach, causes
dyspepsia, also consumption. Do you
want relief and cure? If so, try our
great remedy.

Melba . Theatrical posters are often unconsciously
humorous. A case in point is the old familiar one,
“See Charles Warner in Drink." A well-known Ander-
sonian melodrama is “The Price of Sin.” The bills
usually read : “ The Price of Sin—3s., 2s. and Is.” Some-'
what similar was the poster of another Andersonian pro-
duction which the writer saw in Perth, with Walter
Dagleish as juvenile lead. The hoarding's were gay with
the legend “ Why Woman Sins—See Walter Dagleish
at Her Majesty’s Theatre.” Way back in the ’eighties an
American actress named Louise Pomeroy was starring
in Melbourne, the late Herbert Flemming being in her com-
pany. Louise was a heavy (in every sense) tragedienne—
a leg’lllar Dreadnought of the boards. One of her stock
pieces was “ Led Astray,” and the posters thereof were
the standing joke of Melbourne in those days. And no
wonder, for they ran—“ Louise Pomeroy—Led Astray
for One Night only." J
“P.Q.”: Asa frequenter of biograph shows, I derive
almost as much interest from the comments of my fellow
regulars as from the pictures. The other night, at
West’s, I recognised among the suitors for a millionaire’s
daughter a tall, gaily-caparisoned youth who had the
previous week appeared as the villain in a case of
attempted suicide, supervening on seduction under
aggravated circumstances. I wasn’t the only one who
recognised him. “See that feller,” observed a factory-
gul behind me, ‘ that’s the same one ! I’d swear to him
out of er dozen 1 Ido ’ope ’e don’t marry ’er ! It was ’im
that treated that girl somethin’shockin’. You remember!

the identification, and gradually others did.
Ihat s nil 1 ” came from the rear. “ 1 know ’im ! ’E’s
a . , . <!( , )W ’ a , n ’ 110 '"‘stake ! ” The story was gradually
unfolded, apd the erstwhile scoundrel played the hero’s
strenuous part, knocking down presumptuous persons
saving the heroine’s life, rescuing little children from
beneath motor cars, and paying the rent for needy
washerwomen. In the end, he carried off the millionaire’s
daughter by a masterpiece df gallantry. But the audience
didnt enthuse to any extent ; the psychology of the
traducers sudden conversion was too much for it.
“A.D.”: “Harrison O.’s” item (19/S/’O9) recalls to
mind an hilarious incident in the tour of that wild
and woolly tragedian, Bandmann, who bounded across
the Australian theatrical landscape a few decades ago.
A Danish Ha.mlet was right enough, but a Danish Macbeth,
who said, Leadt on, Mactuff, undt tamdt pe he who
hrst cries holdt, enuff," and rent his kjlts in the effort
wouldn t gee at all. Hence the tour was a record at
ghastly failure. The Herr and his wife comprised the
whole outfit when he reached the little town of Glad-
stone (Queensland), and the memory of his first glad
night is still treasured by old-timers. The Town Hall
with its packing case stage, was the one show place of the
town that should have been the capital of North Australia,
but isri t. There were no dressing-rooms attached, and
mummers had to hire the reading-room of the equally
miniature School of Arts. But cash was short with the
Herr, so he improvised a dres-ing-room right in the fore-
front of the OP. wing. It was a very midget changing-
place, and a sheet screened the Herr from the audience
In one of lus quick-change impersonations Bandmann,had
to haul off a pair of silken tights. But he was large and
bullc.i, and the lights were very tight indeed. With his
back to the audience, he was hopping frantically on one i
leg, and wrestling like a Viking with the obdurate cos-
tume when he collided.with the sheet. Alas ! that sheet,
was not a fixture, and a perfect hurricane of ribald
applause greeted the appearance of a large, unclothed
perspiring rear section of the Herr before the footlights’
The show ran for three nights, and every cowboy for
miles tolled up thinking this particular scene was part of
the business. That was the most successful night in the
.Whole of.Bandmann’s disSstrous tour.

“Melb.” : Argus correspondents have of late been ex-
panding upon the history of local playhouse building
and, of course, there is some mixing up/The first theatre
was a bunk named the Victoria, in Bourke-street, near
h e Bull and Mouth. Next came a little playhouse called
the Adelplu, I‘linders-lane, between Elizabeth and Queen
streets. The Queen’s Theatre, owned by J. T Smith
seven times Mayor, opened in 1845, Tinder Nesbitt.’
Three months afterwards Coppin’s company came there
from Launceston. A star tragedian of the Queen’s was
Morton King subsequently auctioneer, magistrate and
legislator. His real name was Mark Last. He had been
a Sydney timber merchant, but took to the boards in the
other way. No new theatres came till 1855, when there
were three—the Royal, Olympic and Astley’s. The Royal
was built by John Black, a carried. The Olympic of iron
was brought by Coppin from England in the steamer
Argo. Brooke followed, in the steamer Pacific.
He opened at the Queen’s. The Olympic opened
with wizard Jacobs. G. B. VV. Lewis lost £30,000
over Astleys. It opened as a circus. There had
already been two large circuses. Noble’s opened
on the north-west corner of Bourke and Sprinv
streets. It was a canvas place, afterwards turned into
wood. Rowe’s circus came from San Francisco, and
opened on the corner of Lonsdale and Stephen streets
Coppin erected the Olympic on the same site. Astlev’s
was turned into the Royal Amphitheatre, for drama.
Next, Alex. Henderson, from Bendigo, named it the
Princess Theatre. It was all wood. Rowe came back
from V/aliforma and built a new theatre in 1858 the
American Hippodrome, extending from the back of the
Theatre Ro\al to the hospital. Afterwards it was called
the Prince of Wales Theatre and the Lyceum. The next
new theatre was Coppin’s little Pantheon, Oremorne
Gardens. He also built the Havmarket, 1862. Then came

The Milk Foods closely approximate in composition to
lliuman Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant.
They are as' easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns-
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Allenburys" Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
only being necessary.
The “Allenburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

One method of aoolving Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.
//
DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses ofMen and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
ney Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation,
Disorders etc., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electnci y,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin’S Electric Belt, gives to every |»rt
of the P body—as it travels over the nerves—strength and vitality, and quick y
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system-not enough electricity to keep up your
nerve force-and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak

A Maorilandeb has been cursing that country
before he quits it for Queensland
Everything- is exported, to the cost of those who are in
poor circumstances, and their name is legion. One can
buy Maoriland mutton in London cheaper than her.e. .
Well, the Maoriland Government alone has bor-
rowed £69,000,000, and the local governing bodies
have borrowed £12,000,600, and everybody else
has borrowed just about every penny he has been
able to raise ; and the bulk of all the borrowings
has been from Bull Cohen. All this debt carries
interest, and Maoriland has to export things
to pay the interest. It doesn’t matter what the
market may be like on the other side. Even if
Maoriland mutton only fetched Id. per lb. in
London, Maoriland would still have to send it
away and sell it for Id. All the difference the
low price would make would be that M.L. would
have to send away more mutton, and that would
make the price lower in London. And through
sending away more mutton to London there
would be less mutton left in Maoriland, and that
would make the price higher in Maoriland. It is
only a question of getting deep enough into debt,
and Maoriland will have to toil 16 hours out of
the 24 at raising and exporting mutton and selling
it for Id. per lb. in,London, while the Maorilander
himself, because all his decent mutton has gone
to London’s overstocked market,, pays lOd. per lb.
for his o'wn scarce old chop in Wellington or
Auckland.

THE WEIGHT QUESTION.
In the weight of a bicycle there exists a point where safety is assured. Every ounce beyond
that point is superfluous and means wasted energy. Every ounce of that superfluous weight cut on
means increased ease of propulsion. In a bicycle built of
GENUINE B.S.A. FITTINGS
the point of safety is assured —not by a clumsy addition of weight, but by the usr||rf the
finest material the world produces, by the knowledge of the most expert designers, and
by the most scientific methods of manufacture known to-day.
Thus are secured the three essentials—Strength, Lightness, Speed. The fourth essen-
tial equally important—is Suitability, and this can be secured by having your new bicycle
built to your order to suit yourself.

Epitaph.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
W W HY stand the dockyards silent !
f/jfy/' What ails the yards of Tyne ?
r r Is Sunderland a graveyard? Where's
Greenock of lang-syne,
And all the railway depdts and all the cars in
line ?■”
And heard ye not the story ; or is it that ye dream,
Ye Engineers and Stokers who thus astounded
seem—
In nineteen hundred (sometime) the world had
done with steam !
They tried it down in Egypt, three thousand
years ago,
That kettle-boiling method, but found it crude
and slow;
Just ear marked its invention, and left the matter
so;
Until a Gaelic person, once-glorified, named
Watts,
Sate mooning o’er his parritch and contemplating
pots:
And so achieved distinction and burned himself
in spots.
And Stephenson and Fulton, with engineers a
score,
Perfected water boilers, till all the wide world
o’er
The potent white steam clouded, red glowed the
furnace door.
And so, a passing epoch, it reigned, this New
World Power ;
A tyrant and a. master, a rank, exotic flower
On weeds of Exploitation, that flourished for an
hour.
It ’slaved the toiling legions, it held the Earth in
thrall ;
It narrowed down the Distance; yea, by its
mighty call,
The Fashion of the Ages was changed for good
and all.
It brought the hosts to battle, it drove the fleets
to fight;
On steel and iron altars, year-long, by day and
night,
Pale, sooty priests of Progress, its pale fires kept
alight;
That all the world might worship with Body,
Brains and Soul,
In use and constant service ; give fealty and toll
Unto this new-born Offspring, of Water—wed to
Coal.
And Lo ! in nineteen-sometime, one Smith, a
hermit-hatter,
The Universal-Boiler Age to Hades swift did
scatter,
By finding how to draw direct its energy from
matter!
Thus motors now, on rail-less roads, and airships
overhead,
From storage cells of Native Force at intervals are
fed—
And Smith in half a decade slew the Great Steam
Fetich dead ;
Turned turbines into ancient freaks, made rail-
roads seem a jest;
Converted boilers into junk, and simply left, the
rest
As potent as a catapult, compared to Armstrong's
best.
“Six-penn’orth of atomic force, please sir,” the
youthful Turk
Or Mongol at the counter cries these days with
easy smirk —
“Our airship came uncharged last night, and
father’s late for work.”
One generator to a shire, one station to a town,
Whence light and energy with ease, on wires are
measured down,
To run a mill or light a church a month for half-a-
crown;
Of course it changed the world at once—a Cheap
and Noiseless Force
That did away with smoke and smell, and waste
and clamor hoarse
Of engines that to-day appear so clumsy, old
and coarse.
VICTORIA, 1950, A.D.
E. J. BRADY.
A House of Insults.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A DOOR banged like the brazen Gates
of Doom, and a loud, indignant wailing
floated up the stairs to where three hag-
gard men played cards by moonlight.
“ Never hare I been so insulted in my life before !
Never!” It rang out like the howl of a muezzin
calling the faithful to prayer, and even the far-off
sound of the cat leaping on the kitchen-table in
search of nourishment went unheeded in the
shuddering silence that tiptoed in the
footprints of the last word.
“ And in my own house, too /” Again the dismal
voice below rang out, calling the attention of
whatever gods were on duty to the outrage.
“Your deal,” said the man without a collar,
throwing down the greasy cards.
“ Never have I been so insulted before! Never ! ”
The little man with sideboards stopped suddenly
in his dealing and said, fervently, “ I wish to G-d
I hadn’t asked her for that candle ! ” Then he
finished dealing, and all three took up their cards
and examined them.
“ Pass ! ” said the man with the benevolent grey
beard.
“ Pass ! ”
“ Pass ! ”
The man without a collar put his knife in the
kitty to mark the double-header, and took up the
cards for another deal.
“ Never have I been so insulted in my life /”
“ I’ll go three.”
“ Four,” muttered the dealer.
“ I pass ! ”
“ And in my own house, too! ”
The little man with sideboards dashed down his
cards with sheeplike fury. “I won't stand it!”
he shouted. “ I'll go down and tell her I won’t
stand it! ” He rose, and edging past the other
two went down the stairs into the utter darkness.
The pair of players, listening intently, could hear
the shuffle of his slippers on each step and his
slithering progress along the tattered linoleum of
the hall. Then there was a sound of timid knock-
ing and his lost voice crying, *'■* Now ! now ! Mrs.
Fadstitch ! ”
Never have I been so insulted in my life!”
From behind the distant door the lament of the
landlady sounded defiantly.
‘‘Now, now, Mrs. Fadstitch ! This won’t do
at all ! ”
“ And — in — my — own—house !”
“Mrs. Fadstitch! I won’t put up with this
sort of thing !”
Silence.
‘‘Now, now, Mrs. Fadstitch !”
Then the two listeners upstairs heard the ex-
plosive sound of a door opened suddenly from
within, and a loud angry voice trumpeted, “So
it’s uou, is it?”
“Yes,” replied the voice of the courageous
sheep. “I’ve come down to tell you I won’t
stand it ! ”
“ HOW—DARE—YOU ! ”
“The mere fact of a person asking for a
candle ”
“ What! Another candle ! ”
“ asking for a candle, Mrs. Fadstitch ”
“ Do you mean to tell me you have the imperti-
nence to stand there and ask me— ME ! —for
another candle?”
“Calm yourself, my dear madam. I didn’t
ask ”
“Never have I been so insulted in my
LIFE ! ”
“Now, now, Mrs. Fadstitch !”
“ And—in—my—own— house ! ”
“ Tut— tut, now ! ” In.a soothing tone.
“ How dare you say that to me ! ’’
“Mrs. Fadstitch, you must control yourself !”
“ How dare you tell me I must control
myself!”
“ Let us be reasonable, Mrs. Fadstitch ! ”
“ It is like your impertinence to say so ! ”
“Now, my dear madam ”
“Never have I been so insulted in my
LIFE ! ”
“Oh! Damn it all !” shouted the small man
hopelessly. The two above heard him slither a
step or two towards the stair when, with renewed
energy and Asiatic enthusiasm, the landlady’s
voice chanted, “Cursing—and—swearing—and—
demanding—candles—right—and—left ? ”
“ I only asked for one! ” shouted the sheep.
“Never have I been”
The little man pattered furiously upstairs and
burst in upon the awe-stricken pair.
“ I won’t stand it! ” he yelled. “I won’t stand
any more of it ! ” He sat on the edge of the bed
and mopped his brow.
“Cursing and candles and card-playing for
MONEY WHILE I SIT DOWN HERE AND STARVE ! ”
added the Voice triumphantly.
The man with the benevolent beard stumbled
out to the stair-rail and shouted down “Nobody
here has got any money ! ”
“Don’t I know it!” intoned the dark land-
lady. “ Haven’t I been robbed and insulted all my
life!”
“ Well, nobody here’s got a d d penny ! ”
“For three blessed weeks you idle men have
been playing cards for money in my house ! ”
“ Well, nobody’s got any money ! ”
“ And burning my candles”
“ You will be paid in due ”
“When are you three idle men going to stop
playing cards for money?”
“I tell you we’re not playing cards for money
at all ! We’re playing in a quiet gentlemanly way
to pass the hours until such time as we can obtain
remunerative employment.”
Answered the Voice, “I’ve been robbed and in-
sulted and trampled on by boarders all my life,
and nobody that ever lived under my roof ever
had a penny, or did any work, or wanted to ! ”
Hoarse with suppressed fury, the man with the
benevolent beard shouted back, “You will be
paid in full in due course!” With which
characteristic remark he resigned his share in the
discussion, and, returning from the lobby, sat
down and stroked his flowing whiskers in gloomy
silence.
The man without a collar, who had been aim-
lessly shuffling the cards from one hand to the
other, said miserably, “ Now you’ve offended her !
What’s the good of being insulting to the woman?”
The man with the benevolent beard turned on
him angrily. “Well,” he sneered “why don’t
you go down and pacify her, instead of skulking
up here in the dark? Why don’t you go down
and talk to her in an easy, gentlemanly fashion,
eh?”
The man with the cards shuffled his feet and
muttered angrily to himself.
“ Because you’re afraid, my dear sir ! Afraid /”
“No,” sighed tlie other, “I’m only ashamed.
I wouldn’t be, though, if I had any money.”
“Bah !” hissed the man with the benevolent
beard. “Who would be afraid or ashamed if he
had money ? But why be a skulking coward
because you don’t happen to have it?”
“ I’m not a skulking coward ! ”
“ You are, my dear sir—you arc!”
“Why? Because I haven’t got the face to go
down and ask the wretched woman for a candle ! ”
“You were ready enough to sit by the candle
if Flidger or I could get it, though.”
“ I know I was. But ”
"Well, what do you call that ? ”
“I call it pride, d——n you—proper pride.”
“Bah !”
The little man burst passionately into the argu-
ment. “ PRIDE !” he shouted. “Do you think
you’ve got all the pride in the house? Hasn’t
anybody else got any? Now I see why I’ve
always got to go and ask for candles. I thought
it was only your d d laziness, when all the
time it was just to save your rotten pride ! What
about MY pride?”
“Yes,” boomed the man with the beard,
fiercely, “and what about mine, confound you?
Three times within the last week, when it" was
your turn to go down and ask for candles, have I
gone and humiliated myself to that lodging-house
woman, and been insulted with my poverty to
save the dignity—God help us !—of a d d
barnstormer ! ”
The actor flung down the cards at the insult and
waved his clenched fist in the air. “By Heaven! ”
he hissed, “ this is too much ! ”
“No, by the lord Harry, it’s not! I’ve had
enough of your mountebank tricks, and if I were
a younger man I’d knock you down. You’re a
scoundrel, sir! ” He thrust his fiercely-wagging
beard within a foot of the furious actor’s face, and
the actor, with his open hand, pushed furiously at
the mass of whiskers and knocked the man they
were attached to over on the floor.

ACCIDENTS will happen even in
the best=regu!ated families.
Healthy youngsters seem to be
always “in the wars”; house=
work abounds with mishaps for
busy wives and harassed mothers ;
and the bread=winner often returns
from work with a more or less serious
injury. Just what every home needs
is Zam=Buk. A pot and a bandage on
a handy shelf, where they are handy for
instant use, save untold pain, time and
money.
When the little one runs in from his play with a wry face and smarting, dirt-
filled scrape on his knee, simply wash the part and smear with Zam-Buk. When
father cuts or scrapes his hand, the handy pot of Zam-Buk again meets the
emergency, and the housewife or mother continually finds it a real friend in need
for the burns she receives while cooking, the scalds of a washing-day, or the
knocks and bruises of dusting.
Children like Zam-Buk because it is cooling, soothing and pleasant. Their
elders value it still more highly because it is also antiseptic and a powerful
germicide, preventing poisoning, festering and disease; because it is a natural
skin-repairer, growing new tissue in Nature’s way ; and because it is good for the
tenderest skin. Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk a daily need, therefore “keep
Zam-Buk handy ” is a sound home motto.
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
CUTS, BRUISES and SORES.
Mr. J. Turnbull, of 29 Shemel Street,
Waterloo, Sydney, says.: “I am a
carpenter by occupation, and am con-
stantly knocking my hands about. Cement
and lime get into the cuts and sores, causing
them to fester, and, if neglected, would
necessitate my leaving off work. Prompt
application of Zarn-Uuk, however, gives
instant relief. My children have also found
Zam-Buk invaluable for burns, cuts, bruises
and chicken-pock sores, allaying the irrita-
tion and inflammation of the latter com-
plaint in a very short time.”
Zam-Buk is invaluable for
oczema, uioers, ringworm,
bad legs, rashes, erup-
tions, pimples, sores,
and ail injured and
diseased conditions of the
skin and tissue. Of ail
chemists and stores at 1/6
and 3/6 per pot (3/6 holds
nearly four times the 1/6),
or from the Zam-Buk Co.,
39 Pitt Street, Sydney.
A MOTHER’S PRAISE.
Mrs. Jones, who resides at Albert
Park, Hartley District, Lithgow,
N.S.W., says: “Zarn-Buk is,theever-
ready healer in my home for cuts, burns,
bruises, scalds, sores, chafed hands and other
troubles, and I have found nothing- to equal
it. I have tried many other so-called healers
from time to time, but found none to com-
pare with Zatn-Buk. No mother should be
without a pot handy in the home for use on
the children, as they are always hurting-
themselves one way and another, and Zam-
Buk conies in very useful.” t

“You villain ! Help. Flidger ! Help me up!
Old man as I am, I’ll thrash him ! ”
Little Flidger rushed to the assistance of the
man who called himself old but was only middle-
aged and lazy, and the terrified actor, with a back-
ward hunted look, ran out through the doorwav,
scrambled madly up the stairs, and, falling into
his room, banged and locked the door.
'•Where’s the d d scoundrel, Flidger?
Where is he ? I’ll flog him for this. He sha’n’t
escape me—-old man as I am!”
“No, no, Mr. Bodger ! You mustn’t! He
will apologise—he must apologise ! ” The little
man danced about in an ecstasy of fear.
"Apologies won’t do me, Flidger! I’ll drag
him out and thrash him within an inch of his life!
111 flog him ! Where is the scoundrel?”
“Hes in his room, Mr. Bodger. But I beg
you ”
“111 have him out, Flidger? I’ll drag him out
and flog him ! Come with me.” He stumped
heavily out with a great show of determination
and ferocity, and the little man followed, pluck-
ing at his arm and begging him not to do unvthing
rash.
They stamped up the stairs—or Bodger stamped
and Flidger crept—to the actor’s room, and there
bodger pounded on the door, and informed the
shivering inmate in a loud voice that he intended
to thrash him.
Up the stairs floated one of the landlady’s
public soliloquies. “Gaming and cursing and
candles to no end won’t satisfy them. Now
they’re going to insult me in tnv own house
by murdering each other. Oh ! they ought to be
ashamed of,themselves !.”
The magnificent and awe-inspiring Bodger
waved his whiskers over the stair-rail and shouted,
“Not murder, ma’am. I’m only just about to
thrash a scoundrel.”
“ Are you going to insult me in my own house
by thrashing scoundrels in it? ”
“He struck me, Mrs. Fadstitch ! He knocked
me down like a ninepin, and I’m going to flog the
-ooundrel ! ’’
“Do you think my house is fit for nothing but
flogging scoundrels in ?”
“ But he struck me, ma’am! He knocked me
down like a blackguard !”
“ And what else are you fit for but to be knocked
down like a blackguard ? I’ve been in this house
thirty years next week, and nkveu have I been so
insulted as I have been to-night! Never! And
in my own house, too /”
Before the amazed Bodger could think of a
suitable reply, there came a most furious bang-
ing at the street door. It continued until the
distraught landlady went and opened. Then
there was a whispered conversation and two
shrieks and an indignant roar from Bodger of,
“God bless my soul, if the woman isn’t kissing a
coal-heaver ! ”
The landlady in the midst of her transports,
looked up from the shoulder of the mean-looking,
weedy and dirty man she was embracing, and
sobbed, “It’s me beautiful son come back from
the sea with a fortune, and I’m going to throw up
all me boarders and live like a perfect lady for
ever—you see if I don’t ! ”
Bodger, staring and enraged, came down a step
or two and held up one hand like a bishop pro-
nouncing a jjenediction. “Woman!” he roared,
“ this is not a play! Release that man and let
him bring in his coal !”
But the hysterical landlady only clung closer to
the mean-looking, under-sized man and wailed.
It’s me beautiful son ! It’s me beautiful son ! ”
Bodger turned furiously on Flidger, who was
cowering behind, and cried passionately, “Are
we a parcel of d d actors, or are we not ? This
is the sort of cursed thing that only happens in
the third act! It isn’t real! It’s a d—d bit of
acting!” Then to the landlady, “Put that man
out! ”
But the landlady cried out again, “It’s me
beautiful son come home with a fortune.”
Bodger wheeled on the miserable Flidger and
roared at him, “D’ye hear that? She says the
coal man’s her beautiful son and that he’s come
back from the sea with a fortune. The dirty
blackguard! If a son of mine came back to me
like that and told me he’d made his fortune, I’d
flog him within an inch of his life ! You hear
me ! I’d Jlog him ! ”
At that, the alleged coal man sulkily disengaged
himself from the landlady’s embrace and slouched
meanly to the foot of the stair. “ I’m er son, I
tell yer,” he whined. “ I’m ’er son, an’ I’ve made
me fortin’.”
“You’re not!” yelled Bodger. “You’re a
filthy ruffian, and you’re acting ! I know it’s all
d——d acting !”
“It’s true, I tell yer ! ” growled the man.
“It’s lies !” yelled Bodger. “It couldn’t be
true. Good God ! d’ye think I'm mad? You’re
too dirty to be anything but a coalheaver. I tell
you you’re a dirty coalheaver, and that you’re
acting.”
“Oh, am I!” snarled the man. “ Well, look
at this —an’ this!” As he spoke, he drew from
his pocket two chamois-leather bags, and, calling
to the tearful landlady to hold up her dirty apron,
emptied a heap of gold coins into it with a rush.
“ Oh, me beautiful son ! ” wailed the, landlady,
doing a sort of waltz with her laden apron heid
out in front of her, while the dirty son caught up
handfuls of the gold and let it trickle through his
fingers.
Bodger flung out an accusing arm. “More of
your d——d acting !” he roared. “ It’s stage money
it isn’t real. It’s all d d acting!” He turned
round to Flidger and howled: “ Haul out that
acting criminal from upstairs, and let us have him
down to help them.” '
“You come ’ere and see f’r yerself if it ain’t
reel!” growled v fhe, man; and Bodger went down
like a man in a dream and saw that he spoke the
truth.
Instantly he turned to Flidger and yelled,
“ He’s robbed a bank! He’s robbed a bank, by
the Lord, and we’ll all be in gaol in the morning !
Let’s get out, Flidger, before the police get us!
It’s a den of thieves and actors, and if we’re
found here we’ll get ten years apiece and a Hog-
ging—and serve usd d well right ! Where’s my
hat?”
Then the wizened man stepped in front of the
perfectly insane Bodger and yelled, “ Don’t yer
b’leeve me now'! Don’t yer b’leeve I’m ’erson nor
nothin ’ ? ”
And Bodger howled back, “NO, you black-
guard ! 1 don’t, and I won’t believe anything
about you ! I know you’re a dirty ruffian and
that you’re acting and that you’ve robbed a bank.
And if you try to tell me any more lies or act to
me, I’ll give you a d d good flogging ! Out of
my way, you ruffiau !” He stormed past the man
and the slowly-collapsing landlady who held a
fortune in her apron, and Flidger, with a battered
straw hat on his head and bearing an ancient bell-
topper and a large knobby stick in his arms,
followed him down the hall and out of the house.
Outside, Bodger assumed and
the stick, and they linked arms and walked away
together into the night, Bodger—who had been
thrown completely off his mental bslmce—gesti-
culating with the enormous stick and giving five
thousand different reasons why it must be all lies
and acting'.
And, back in the house the}' had left so vio-
lently, the landlady was sitting dazed in the
middle of her own grimy and insulted hall, sur-
rounded by gold pieces, while her unheroic-look-
ing son told her—in remarkably bad grammar-
how, after many patient years “puttin’ in,” he
had at last drawn the third horse.
KODAK,
Art.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN a land that ye may know of rose a strong,
determined foe of
Cant and Maunder, aged Shoddy, and the
Ancient Rot of years ;
Published large defiant verses, dragging dead
things to their hearses—
But alas! his views were Modern, so his efforts
met with sneers !
Came the Critics, animated with conceptions anti-
quated.
Fillet! with vast respect for Mummy and the Cere-
ments of the Tomb ;
His were thoughts men needed badly—but his
works they pondered sadly,
And pronounced with solemn unction certain
heavy words of doom !
“ Sir,” they said, “ your verseful vigor may appea 1
to smith and digger,
And we hear you’re making money and are quoted
in the mart;
But alas ! you do not write of things the Dead
Men did indite of—
And you flout the ancient canons, and we fear it
isn’t Art! ”
Then the writer, being cheerful, thought to
please these parties tearful,
So he ceased to rail at Maunder and to scoff at
gods of Cant;
Ceased his writing altogether—straightway
slipped his poet’s tether,
And commenced to splash on canvas like a festive
elephant! -
Smith the gloomy, Jones the sweater—folk who
bowed ’neath custom’s fetter—
These he pictured, these he painted, likewise
laborers at toil ;
Parsons monkey-lipped and doleful—these in
manner strong and soulful
Were depicted true to pattern, both in crayons
and in oil !
Pompous folk—yea, men Right-Thinking; curate-
creatures sadly slinking—
These as well the painter wrought on; bishops,
too, and fat Jay Pees ;
Flunkeys sleek and choir-girls smirking, loafers
idle, strong men working—
Such he pictured as he saw them, then he said :
“Just look at these !”
So the Critics came in dozens—dreary folk, yea,
parsons’ cousins—
And they gazed upon his paintings, whilst their
jaws in horror fell ;
“Sir,” they gasped, “these things are awful—we
must have them made unlawful.
You have wrecked the Arch-Commandment—you
have dared the truth to tell !
“ It is true, the world may buy them—sinful folk
may gladly eye them
Men, alas ! are full of badness and the globe is
paved with woe ;
But these pictures will not do, sir; you have
chosen subjects new, sir,
And the M isters did nbt do so in the sacred Long
Ago !
“We, the Critics, rise to warn you, righteous folk
will surely scorn you.
Bishop Smith will preach about it; Deacon Jones
the prayer will start;
You have scoffed at old Tradition, and at persons
of position—
You may sell your wicked pictures, but we say it
isn’t Art! ”
So the painter dropped his palette, and he seized
the sculptor’s mallet.
“I will sculp,” said he, “some subjects that these
folk will surely hail ;
Drunken monarehs. Justice sleeping, Envy base
and Malice creeping—
And the dead man on the gallows, and the convict
in the gaol! ”
Then once more the Critics hied them to his
workshop, and decried them—
“lt is vain!” they said; “lie's Modern, as we
wrote long years before ;
!Tis the same audacious scoffer—yea, no praise
have we to offer,
For such themes are most improper, and these
sculptures we deplore !
“You must bow to old Tradition—to Cellini and
to Titian—
You have written, sculped and painted ; heed
these words that we impart;
Try the old romantic themes, sir—dreatn the
ancient, fusty dreams, sir—
All these works of yours are Modern, and we say
it isn’t Art! ”
But the Painter-Sculptor-Writer said: “Col-
lective Blatherskiter,
You are ignorant and foolish, and no more I’ll
strive to please ;
You have made a joss, of Mummy—yea, have
raised a futile durum}',
Now I rise to wreck your idol and your Old
Tradition wheeze !
“With the eras Art advances—you are lost in
ancient trances.
Ye are brooding over Maunder, over aged things
and slow.
All the men whereof ye prated in their day were
execrated—
They were Modern then, and rebels— hang the
sacred Long Ago!”

“Four years ago I had to stop shearing, as I suffered
so with rheumatism, caused by the damp sheep. As the
liniments and medicines I tried
did me no good, I thought seri-
ously of going to the hospital,
but was induced to try Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. From the first bot-
tle I began to get better. I took
seven bottles in all, and I now am
free from pain, and can eat and
sleep grandly. I feel like a new
man.” A . H. Watson,
Gawler, S. A.
