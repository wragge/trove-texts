The Red Page
Books About India
Henry Bruce, who writes novels about
India, might be a bigger novelist if his
works had a little more beginning, weren’t
so short of plot, design and middle, and
were less lacking in end. For anyone who
has even skirmished through the country
must get the impression that he knows it
as Dickens knew London. The Residency,
The Eurasian and The Song of Surrender
are tales of a huge land of ghosts, make-
believe, of arrogance, of exclusiveness, of
caste, of disillusionment, weariness, vanity,
of all the things that made Solomon tired
in his old age.
There is nothing much wrong with the
climate of India, which is in the same lati-
tudes at one end as North Queensland,
while the other end corresponds with the
best and most habitable part of the United
States —nothing wrong except the breath and
the habits and tlfe sanitation of 320,000,000
colored people, accumulated for 320,000
years. They didn’t ask the white folk to
come there, aiid they don’t, as a rule, ask
him to stay ; so he remains apart as a pom-
pous, suffering, self-made, self-sacrificing
martyr or hermit. But he doesn’t remain
longer than he can help. He says that
India is a very bad hotel, a caravanserai,
which, under his intrusive management, is
unfit for a European to live in, and every-
body’s ambition is to get away and retire
on a pension.
The Englishman is supposed by a polite
fiction to be in India to teach the native
the art of self-government. When he first
went there hardly anybody in England ex-
cept the peerage and landed aristocracy had
any share in the government. India gov-
erned itself, in .some sort of fashion, before
England was born. The Native States,
which comprise more than one-third of what
is India on the map, still govern themselves
with a certain amount of British inter-
ference. When the Indian becomes too
rampant in the matter of self-government he
is regarded as a traitor of the deepest dye,
just a.s if he was a MacMurrogli or Mac-
Potheen of Connaught.
Henry Bruce has very little to say of the
Roman Catholic missionaries. Being celi-
bates they are outside the struggles of the
minor clerics who want to get their wives
and offspring into official society, even
though it be only the society of the Resi-
dency at Dogpore. The Anglicans are pre-
sented as men who went to India for no
special reason except that they happened to
go. They mostly had no enthusiasm to
begin with, and speedily lost even that.
They are presented as a narrow clique, in
which each parson keeps his inferior strictly
in his place, and they pass on the unpleasant-
ness till the avalanche falls on the native
preacher. He is a poor, dry thing who
quitted one of the minor and least-considered
castes for Christianity, and is half-inclined
to wish he were back if return was possible,
for he often finds caste more galling in the
new life than the old. His salary, which
can hardly be said to exist, is always being
docked Is. 4d. for alleged misconduct, and
he illegally uses the dry river bed as a vege-
table garden to raise money for the repair
of his surplice. He ropes in a convert now
and then, always of a poor class, for the
high-toned Hindus are never converted, and
his superiors don’t thank him for it.
Bruce draws clerics of many sorts—
“ Francis Bombay,” the “chameleon bishop,”
with a disagreeable voice and eczema; the
athletic parson, who debates as to the
shortest time in which the service can be
put through without irreverence; and the
examining parsons, who decide that a cer-
tain young cleric who is “bad form” shall
not pass for promotion, he being an indi-
vidual who should be put down. There is
hardly .one quite wholesome character in ' the
list. “The Residency” tolerates the higher
clergy and ignores most of the others. It
regards them as anomalous. They are sup-
posed to preach a gospel of equality and
brotherhood, but if they seriously attempted
to do it “The Residency” w T ould have to
deal with them for stirring up sedition.
“The Residency” has anomalies of its
own. It has to keep the native princes and
potentates contented, if it can. It has to
convince them of the sublime justice and
complete desirability of British rule, if it
can. It has to make it clear to them at the
same time that they are such unutterable
dirt that for one of them to marry even nn
ordinary sort of white girl is profanation,
and to think of her is almost profanation—
if they can. One otherwise successful and
v„ery high white official whom Bruce depicts
fails to draw the line with sufficient strict-
ness, and is murdered by a shambling half-
caste who has been foiled in his attempt
to adopt him as a father. The only strenu-
ous moment of the shambler’s life is when
he turns the carving-knife in the wound he
has made in the official neck. Another Resi-
dent, who draws the line rather rigidly,
spends his last days going round on all
fours and gibbering. This is the result of
datura administered in his liquor by the order
of a prince at whom he had snorted a trifle
too hard. Apparently there is a medium in
these things. Both troubles are connected
with a half-caste Christian girl, who solves
the problem by turning plain nigger.
Henry Bruce doesn’t seem to have any
military or other enthusiasm. about India.
He doesn’t Kipple. He doesn’t seem to
regard the British rule as in the least de-
gree permanent, and yet he doesn’t take
the-' trouble to argue that it isn’t. He
rather regards India as a habit. And he
depicts the British in India as rather drab-
colored and disagreeable—about the smallest
aristocracy on earth and the most ferociously
exclusive one, seeing that the lower herd
can’t be promoted into it by any process,
save bleaching; with no roots in the land,
it being a mere passing show of hotel-
dwellers ; and driven to scandal and gossip
and chronicles of small beer, just as St.
Simon Stylites may have been driven to
crochet or tatting on top of his pillar. It
keeps up with difficulty the fiction that the
native is loyal, even devoted, to the sys-
tem it stands for; or, rather, it lets the
fiction keen itself up. It is a makeshift
order of things—a sort of brief Manchu
episode passing over another China. The
Turk in Europe, even in his best days, fur-
nished his houses skimpily through the
instinct at the bottom of his soul that he
was only a lodger, and the white man in
India does the same.

Why Not an Anthology of Brag?
Bragi was the god of poetry among the
forefathers of the Anglo-Saxons, and there is
more than a decent chance that the English
word “brag” is identic# with the older
Word “bragr,” which meant song. For the
songs which went up in the camp of Ilengist
and Cerdic were mostly brag, judging by
samples which "have come down to us from a
later date. Anglo-Saxon verse of the earlier
sort' consisted mostly of short alliterative
barks. There was no rhyme, no exact rhythm,
no trace of anything we mean by poetry
to-day, but there was brag and lots of it.
This is the sort of thing to which Alfred
might have tuned his harp in the Danish
camp:—
Sons of the south land,
Swaddled in sunshine,
Smart in the saddle,
Took to the Turkish
Hosts beyond Hebron,
Hacked them and hewed them,
Harried them horribly.
Drove them Damaseuswards,
Broke them like black beetles
Bashed by the guns!
That singing of that sort should be called
brag is not remarkable; and singing of that
sort having been called brag, it is not re-
markable that a lot of other even less musi-
cal utterances should be called brag in
memory of it.
English poetry has gone a long way since
it left its alliterative yelpings, caught the
spirit of Greece and Rome, tempered it with
Celtic fire and imagination and worked at
the wonderful blend in the light of wider
knowledge and with the aid of a more and
more elastic language. Milton has sung of
Lycidas and Keats of the nightingale and
Burns of love and Tennyson of tears ; and
there has been a new magic that was not
Greek and not Celtic, and which yet had in
it something Greek and Celtic and above all
Anglo-Saxon. For the foundation language
persists in spite of all blendings and sweet-
enings and even by some strange paradox
provides a lot of the sweetening itself for
the general mixture. But something else
persists too; and Bragi has still his follow-
ing. The pages of English literature pro-
vide most memorable examples of pure
brag; and in these days of many anthologies
there is a fine task for some earnest and
laborious person in gathering together these
samples of English boasting in order that
they may be recognised as still having a
definite place in our scheme of song. Here
are a few random examples to start with:
Come the three corners of the world in arms,
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue
If England to itself do rest but true.
— Shakspeare.
My noble task
Of which all Europe rings from side to side.
— Hilton.
He who in concert with an earthly string
Of Britain’s acts would sing,
He with enraptured voice will tell
Of One whose spirit no reverse could quell ;
Of One that ’mid the failing never failed.
. — Wordsworth.
Fir’d at the sound, my genius spreads' her wing,
And flies where Britain courts the western spring....
Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,
I see the lords of human kind pass by.
— Goldsmith.
Thine island loves thee well, thou famous man,
The greatest sailor since oiir world began.
Now, to the roll of muffled drums, .
To thee the greatest soldier comes.
— Tennyson.
The meteor flag of England
Shall yet terrific burn.
— Campbell.
The nations not so blest as thee
Must in their turn to tyrants fall,
Whilst thou shalt flourish great and free
The dread and envy of them all.
Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves !
Britons never shall be slaves.
— Thomson.
But a mightier power, my England !
Is' in that name of thine,
To strike the fire from every heart
Along the banner’d line.
— Hemans.
.... Whom the roar of Hougoumont
Left mightiest of all peoples under Heaven.
— Tennyson.
Regions Caesar never knew
Thy posterity shall sway,
Where his eagles never flew,
None invincible as they.
— Cowper.
This is only a small beginning. The whole
of Henley's “England” should be included
and thousands of lines in modern writers
suggest themselves. Kipling would yield
about a gross of quotations of the very sort
of stuff that is essential “bragr”; Newbolf
would supply about a score; and even
Browning and Swinburne would be repre-
sented in the anthology. A small section
could be kept for the Australians and one
(in proportion a little larger) for the Maori-
landers.
C.O.M.
Impressions (Mostly Faint)
H. Y. Braddon’s business as Common-
wealth Commissioner in the U.S.A. was to
make friends, and in American Impressions
(Angus and Robertson) his inclination is
to keep them. There is much pleasantly-
written description; and while many cases
are lucidly stated, Mr. Braddon generally
shows a good deal of ingenuity in evading a
verdict. Still there are some inescapable
conclusions; and there are others which the
reader cannot escape. No chapter throws
more light on the difficulties which the
Administration has faced during the past six
years than the one headed “Racial.” And
none is more suggestive of the difficulties
that are yet to be faced. For instance:—
One estimate put the number of people of foreign
parentage at one in seven....A coal-mine owner
told me that he had to put up notices in some 15
languages... .Before the war the patriotic American

This Week’s Toilet Hints
INTERESTING SELECTIONS FROM THE WORLD'S SMARTEST BEAUTY
ARTICLES—SIMPLE RECIPES MOST EFFECTIVE.
HOW TO DISCARD AN UNSIGHTLY
COMPLEXON.
“Toilet Club Notes.”
How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexion in the mirror, “If I
could only tear off this old skin !” And, do
you know, it is now possible to do that very
thing? Not to actually remove the entire
skin all of a sudden; that would be too
heroic a method and painful, too, I imagine.
The worn-out cuticle comes off in such tiny
particles, and so gradually—requiring about
ten days to complete, the transformation—it
doesn’t hurt a bit. Day by day the beautiful
complexion underneath comes forth. Mar-*
vellous! No matter how muddy, rough,
blotchy or aged your complexion, you can
surely discard it by this simple process.
Just get some ordinary mereolised wax at
your chemist’s, apply nightly like cold cream,
washing it off in the mornings.
WHY HAVE GREY HAIR
When a simple, old-fashioned and harmless recipe
will correct it?
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age : —that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate of tammalite and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few nights
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nOr greasy, and has given perfect
satisfaction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
A STRANGE SHAMPOO.
“Cosy Cornei* Chats.”
* * * I was much interested to learn
from this young woman with the beautiful
glossy hair that she never washes it with
soap or artificial shampoo powders. Instead
she makes her own shampoo by dissolving a
teaspoonful of stallax granules in a cup of
hot water. “I make my chemist get the
stallax for me,” said she. “It comes only
in sealed packages, enough to make up
twenty-five or thirty individual shampoos,
and it smells so good I could almost eat it.”
Certainlv this little lady’s hair did look
wonderful even if she has strange ideas of a
shampoo. I am tempted to try the plan
myself.
BLACKHEADS INSTANTLY GO.
The new spark!ins; face-bath treatment givt3
instant relief.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to- obtain some tablets
of stymol from the chemist, drop one into
a glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores im-
mediately contract to normal and the greasi-
ness disappears, leaving the skin smooth,
soft and cool 'and free from blemish. But
to make sure that this desirable result is
permanent, it is advisable to repeat the
treatment several times at intervals of say
about four or five days.
IS POWDER NECESSARY?
“Practical Suggestions.”
I say emphatically. No! There is a simple
lotion which can be easily and cheaply made
at home, and it is at the same time both
effective and beneficial to the complexion.
CleminiCfe is a splendid substitute for face
powder, which is at the bottom of many
complexion troubles. Get about an ounce
from the chemist, and dissolve in four table-
spoonfuls of water. The result is a fine
clear liquid, which instantly gives the face,
neck or arms that peach-like bloom of
perfect health. There is nothing to equal
it for greasy skins, and the result lasts all
day long under the most trying conditions. [2

CORNS POSITIVELY CURED
by the use of a remedy so well known that it
has become a household word for the removal
of Corns old and young—hard or soft, and
that remedy is A’CORN SILK, which
removes the worst corn in a few days, and the
sufferer is free from pain. It is* a certain
cure —it kills them. It is a painless cure—
you don’t feel them going. It is a speedy cure

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Problem.
Last night, thinking much of the wonder
Of life, with its shadow that mars
Its sunshine, and all of its problems,
I walked in the light of the stars;
A mist from the moist lands came creeping.
As stealthy its coming as sleep;
Far-searching the Darkness I quested.
I sounded the fathomless Deep.
My fancy, high-soaring, adventured
To where the stars dwindle and wane.
Yet ever, wing-weary, it faltered.
And ever it quested in vain.
Thus thwarted, thus beaten, I fronted
The Vast, the Unknown, the Sublime;
No answer had space to my question.
No answer, no comfort had Time.
I said, “Are we fated to perish
And pass, like the bird and the beast ?”
And then a clear wind, ere the dawning,
Came out of the gates of the East:
Before it the mist on the waters
Was lifted, and, vanishing, swirled ;
Green-gleaming the Dawn lit the heavens.
And God surely breathed on His world.
And now. with the pines like lit torches.
The sea singing low to the shore,
A bird on a branch making music,
I trouble, I question no more;
The problems that fronted and vexed me
With night and its shadows depart.
And Dawn, with its message of courage
And comfort, rekindles my heart.
I see, sailing on in the distance,
The mist and the darkness withdrawn,
A ship standing up on the skyline,
Clear-cut in the light of the Dawn ;
I know not its name or its nation.
Nor where its far journey shall cease.
Sufficient for me is the vision—
Sail on, for my heart is at peace!

RODERIC QUINN.
The White Ship.
Here’s a very lovely thing
Drowsing by the dusty quay.
Whiter than a gannet’s wing
Flecked across a noisy sea;
Let us hold it wonder-eyed,
Joying in her quiet charm—
Lift of bow and sweep of side,
Curving like a maiden’s arm.
Girl, I’ve seen the merry ships
Dancing lightly on their toes.
With a white laugh on their lips
When the grey nor’-easter blows;
Seen the green sea swinging past,
Seething to the summer gale,
When the amber lift of mast
Flashes into happy sail.
Dearer now to me by far
Shines this placid ship of white.
With a single sapphire star
Held within her topsail-height;
Sweet to me her pearly gleams
Answered on the water’s face,
Moving to her quiet dreams,
Catching all her fragile grace.
Timid Evening stoops to hide
Scarp of street and thrusting tower,
All the singing waterside
Hushes to the wistful hour;
All the strong songs of the day
In the ears of night are caught.
Lest Romance should miss her way,
Lest the brain should lose the thought.
Dearest, we may wander wide
To the lilt of life aloof;
Pallid Reason, sombre-eyed,
Flushes at the final proof—
Beauty is a word from God
Flashed across the teeming spheres.
Shining where the nations plod
Heavy-burdened down the years.
Sweetheart, let us softly bide
With a smile upon the lip,
While the gentle harbor-tide
’round the cradled ship;
Warmth of waist and touch of hand.
Moon-white cheek against my cheek.
And my heart will understand
More than ever tongue could speak.

Penitence.
In the .street when the night is all honeyed
and deep,
And the stars are a -soft golden mist
That is dotted with eyes that deliciously
peep
At my soul as I pass, and I don’t feel like
sleep,
I loiter and sigh.
As the girls murmur by.
With a lift of the chin and a glance of the
eye,
The girls that I nevet have kissed.
Oh, I chide myself then for the things left
undone,
For my terrible sins of omission.
And I know r all is vanity under the sun
And the moon (for the moon is another bad
one),
And I, w'orn and flighty,
Pray hard to the mighty
Consoler who pities men, wise Aphrodite.
To mark my despairing contrition.
Then the girls that I never have kissed
gather round,
And a music flutes up from the South.
Thus it happens—but you'll have guessed
that, I’ll be bound —
It happens that ere I dare dream what I’ve
found
Soft fingers touch mine,
Touch and cling and entwine,
While an exquisite glamor thrills through me
like wine.
And two lips pucker up to my month.
* ♦ * *
Oh. you owls, you poor owds. do you know
What you've missed
By neglecting the girls that yon never have
kissed?

HILL’S WAY OF DOING THINGS—
AND ANOTHER WAY.
The misfortunes of war left the Old Man
in London a heavy , debtor to outside capi-
talists, his foreign liabilities being about
£1,278,000,000. This sort of thing hasn’t
happened to J. Bull since the pre-Eliza-
bethan days, when he used to owe money to
the Hanseatic League. The amount, accord-
ing to Australian ideas, is a mere joke. This
country, with about one-ninth the population
of the British Isles, owes fully one-third as
much abroad in its public capacity. That
is to say, it carries three times as much
foreign debt per head. And what, it owes
privately is mere guesswork, but the guesses
are immense. Australia hasn’t even the
excuse that it borrowed abroad, as J. Bull
did. under pressure of war, for most of its
foreign debt was a peace burden incurred
because a loafing and inflated generation
refused to pay taxes. At the time its earliest
foreign debt was incurred Australia paid
neither land tax, income tax, excise duties
nor legacy duties, and it didn’t even put a
stamp on a cheque or receipt. It borrowed
to preserve that blessed immunity. British
statesmen regard foreign debt as a disaster
and a disgrace, so this year the surplus of
£164,000.000 is to be applied towards reduc-
ing outside obligations. To get its surplus
the country dragged itself through the Val-
ley of the Shadow of Death or something
like it. The revenue, almost entirely from
taxation, was pushed up to £29 per inhabi-
tant —over 10s. per week for every man.
woman and child, and over £2 a week for
every family of four. And that was in ■
tion to local taxation on a scale which Aus-
tralia doesn’t even begin to imagine; for in
Britain roads, charities, nolice and schools
are local burdens, and the poorest tenant
pays taxes which often nearly equal his rent.
In Australia, with State and Federal taxes
running to about £7 10s. per head per
annum, and local rates that are infinitesi-
mal, all this seems incredible. Yet the Old
Man in Ixmdon proposes to raise more
taxes and pay off £300,000,000 of his foreign
debt next year. In fact, he aims at wiping
it off by four annual instalments and get-
ting rid of the curse. Lightly-taxed Aus-
tralia (almost a/itaxed Australia, according
to British ideas, and so far as its working
classes are concerned) reverses the process.
Federal Treasurer Watt and State Minister
Theodore and Robinson have fled to Eng-
lend simultaneously to see about getting
more deeply into foreign debt. Six Agents-
General and a High Commissioner are per-
manently in London on the same business.
And the biggest city in Australia is in a
heated tangle about a scheme for finding a
new creditor in the United States —the coun-
try whose mortgage J. Bull is paying off
with so much effort.
Theoretically Australia, which expects to
have about £5 per head of loan money com-
ing in next year while. Britain expects to
have £6 per head of repayment money going
out, ought to be the happier country while
the razzle lasts, and the country with more
to spend. Looking at places like Broken
Hill, where no work has been done for a
year, it seems only like the more demoralised
country. The question of the moment is
whether Britain, with its ideas of solvency,
is the worst fool in the world, or whether
Australia is not only the worst fool but the
worst profligate. They represent the two
extremes, and the verdict of experience is
against Australia. People, and parties and
countries have come to great, trouble by
being in debt, but those which have met
disaster through not owing money are rare.
In any case, Britain, if it finds it has made a
mistake by getting out of debt, can easily
get in again ; but if Australia has made a
mistake by owing and loafing and drifting,
there is no easy way out. Incidentally, it
is a remarkable fact that while Australia
has many rabid admirers or professed
admirers of British ways and institutions,
there isn’t a single politician big enough to
he noticeable who urges the adoption of the
one feature of British policy which British
statesmen are sure about. Every kind of
British Government is agreed upon it; and
though the ambition to pay off the public
debt in peace time has never been quite
realised because peace times weren’t, long
enough, neither Sisyphus nor Bruce’s
spider returned to his job with more per-
sistence.
The Bulletin will not believe that the
majority of the people of Australia realise
that the repudiation of our national debt is
seriously contemplated and seriously pos-
sible. There is, however, a party which is
repudiatory, frankly or otherwise. It includes
anarchists, extremists, cranks, miscellaneous
foreigners and a crowd which for one rea-
son or another doesn’t put Australia first or
even the Empire first. There are more of
these than it is cheerful to think of. And
they don’t all wear straws in their hair.
Archbishop Mannix, who presumably repre-
sents something besides himself, struck a
keynote wheu he said it was his business to
make all possible trouble in Australia as
well as elsewhere, so that Britain might he
compelled to loose its disastrous hold upon
Ireland. In that view Australia isn’t a
country with a future of its own and rights
of its own. It is merely a bit of English
property which can be legitimately laid
waste, like a police barracks in Galway,
as part of the campaign for Irish independ-
ence; and repudiation of the debt, because
it is largely held in England, would be a
natural part of the wastage. A score of
other sections are interested in repudiation,
some because they naturally approve of
smash, others because the idea of robbing
the rich is always popular. There is another
large body which says that we shall repudi-
ate because we must. Thousands of foolish
politicians and others are unintentionally—
as well as intentionally—adding to this
body. The country is full of strange patriots
who preach to the Australian worker that:
he is the poorer, most heavily taxed and
most misfortunate creature on earth—natu-
rally the sort who will have to go insolvent.
*'#*•*
And what are the people who would hang
their heads in shame at the first hint of
national default and repudiation—what are
they doing? For the most party they are
making repudiation easy. They are playing
into the hands of the enemies of Australia
They are piling up debts representing loans
spent on extravagances and on hopeless
public undertakings. Some drift towards
national insolvency while professing honesty;
some are the poor catspaws of more cunning
and far-sighted and mischievous >r
Between these sections Australia’s finan-
cial breakage threatens—partly because it
owes so much and part.lv because it is urged
to be so sorry for itself for having to work
from Mondays till Fridays.
MAN’S ETERNAL DESTINY.
“What, good would any change do unless the
results were improved production and better quality?
If no profit were made, the men would be no better
off financially.” —G. D. Dei, PRAT before the Coal-min-
ing Commission.
The humanitarians start always on the
assumption that by a sudden and tremendous
change in their country’s economic system
the “wage-slaves’’, may both earn more
money and do less work, and that they can
achieve the desired ends by no other means.
The pronhets are of the same type in every
generation—eager young people who have
not yet known disillusion and who possess a
gift for burning speech, pins a proportion
of older men and women who for the most
part are more or less cynically living on
the game of unrest. All their proposals,
whether good or bad, are met in a spirit of
dull, sodden hostility by the trouble-makers
at the other end of the financial scale; and
so the cause of violence is greatly assisted.
Before the world-war the thing to save *Fe
wage-slaves was State Socialism. The
Australian unionist who went abroad found
the doctrine in operation everywhere. The
State not only provided transport and post
and telegraph services, hut boots, hats, socks,
shaving materials and «]] other necessaries ;
it paid the doctor's bill when a man went
to hosnifci. and bnrwd Hib fr»e of ohnvcre
when he died. And, finally, being logical in
its paternalism, it allowed no one to write
or speak publicly in criticism of its efforts.
The insane wastefulness of the system, the
openings which it provided for boodling of
all descriptions, and the petty tyrannies
exercised by the officials who spawned on
every side caused a sharp revulsion of senti-
ment. Many thousands unfairly estimated
State control by their experiences in mili-
tary ordnance stores, or by the spectacle of
countless unused shells at £3 17s. 6d. each
lying about in the Flanders mud, and turned
elsewhere for social salvation.
* * * *
The most conspicuous economic fashions of
the moment amongst the uplifters av*;: (1)
Straight-out confiscation of all capil il, (2)
resumption of capital at a fair price, fol-
lowed by (a) Sovietism, (b) national
guilds. The extremists who advocate these
changes claim, as the Fabian Socialists did
for their policy, that if they are effectuated
the worker ■will toil less for more money.
Their extremist opponents argue, mere or
less irrelevantly, that such schemes repre-
sent bloodshed and rapine, the smashing of
the marriage tie and the triumph of atheism.
The real test is the one put by G. D. Del-
prat, viz., the world and human nature being
constituted as they are, have the different
proposals any hope of material success on
the basis advocated? Direct confiscation is
a weapon directed at the vitals of the democ-
racy. If Brown, the rich man, is to be
expropriated, what security of tenure is left
to Smith, who has saved just enough to
keep him in his old age and who owns the
cottage in which he lives? The reply that
the State will look after both is not likely
to be any more satisfactory to Smith than
to Brown. It is a matter of the way human
beings are built. Even in Russia there has
been —of late, at any rate —no expropria-
tion of capital on the lines advocated by cer-
tain wild people here. The palaces and
estates which have been seized by the Gov-
ernment were the property of Ozarist out-
laws who have fled. Those capitalists—and
they represent a tremendous proportion of
moneyed Russians —who swallowed Leninism
are living idly on the income of their rents
or investments as before. Practically their
only disability is that as non-workers they
are disfranchised. (On this point see
Larry’s Unc Legislation Communiste.) The
alternative to a course which at least
90 per cent, of Australians would jib at on
ethical grounds is resumption at a price.
The workers, through their Government, will
in that case burden themselves with the
colossal debt necessitated by the buying out
of all the station-owners, storekeepers,
manufacturers and so on in the Common-
wealth. The people among whom this vast
sum is divided may either hire new wage-
slaves with it to minister to them here, or,
worse, remove it from the country alto-
gether. They will probably withdraw their
expert knowledge from the businesses in
Which they no longer have a financial in-
terest ; they will certainly withdraw much
of their enthusiasm. Where is the profit
going to come from, in the circumstances,
that will give the communists at work in
the different concerns bigger wages and
shorter hours than are to be got under the
existing system? Recent developments in
Russia supply the answer. In the early
days of Sovietism—which, in itself, is no-
thing more immoral and bloody-minded than
sectional administration, by the workers in-
terested, of farming districts and town busi-
nesses—production fell off. The industrial-
ists and the peasants, believing the fairy-
tale that the world can keep its head above
water without hard work, went so luxuri-
ously slow that factories which had been
prosperous showed a loss and farms began
to go out of cultivation. Under private
enterprise it would have been the funeral
of nobody but the loafer and those who had
the misfortune to be their employers. Under
Sovietism it amounted to a betrayal of the
rest of the people. . The recalcitrants were
called before the official Czars who have
replaced the deposed Czar —some sort of
Czar being a necessity in every civilised
country—and they were instructed to pull
themselves together. Strikes followed in a
number of industries. The strike-leaders were
dealt with by the Red Guards —described
the other day by General Denikin, who
should know, as “the most disciplined fight-
ing force in Europe”—and their measures
were effective. Larky, the French jurist,
who has just returned from a ten-months’
tour of Russia, estimates the working week
there now at 60 hours. The national gran-
aries are “bursting,” as Lloyd George
remarked some months ago, and no one would
go hungry if transport could only be restored
to normal; industrial production is satis-
factory, though at one time many great fae-
tories were shut up for various reasons; the
educational system has been tremendously
improved ; and, the Church having been dis-
established, the churches are naturally doing
better than ever. But no millennium has
arrived as regards either surcease from toil,
or greatly increased remuneration for the
work done. Lenin and his colleagues have
accepted the great truth that money is
merely a token signifying the sweat of either
the brain or the body, and that the printing-
presses or the mints cannot supply a sub-
stitute.
Guild Socialism is the alternative to the
anarchic communism of the original Soviet
system, and Russia is evidently struggling
with a form of it to-day. Under it. the State,
as represented by a dictator of the Lenin
type, is supreme. The uational industries
are partitioned out into guilds. The dicta-
tor and his colleagues (operating under
some such alias as. the “State,” or. as in
Russia, “the proletariat”) fix the hours of
labor, the rates of pay and the penalties for
“offences against the proletariat”—for
example, loafing on the job, striking, or
inciting others to strike. Skilled labor is
paid more than unskilled ; and the suecialist,
whether he happens to be a great doctor or
a popular actor, is remunerated more or
less as he would be under the capitalist sys-
tem. And particular attention is paid to
the arts and to education. Wh»n this
arrangement is analysed it is found to be
very much the same iu all the essentials as
tvrofit-sharing unde" the terms set out in the
Whitley Report. There is an objection, how-
ever. to the, latter scheme in the eyes of the
passionate youths, and their, in many in-
stances. fraudulent elders, who thither about
the need for bringing closer the revolutionary
“day.” There 4 s no grateful of
hate about Whitleyism. It doesn’t. Harmonise
with red ties, and oratory about capitalistic
gore, and the rest of the fustian which is
so popular amongst the brethren of revolt.
If the workers combmed they could get a
large share in the profits of the paying con-
cerns of this country in * addition to their
wages. They are being asked instead to
begin by an upheaval which must destroy
many industries and disorganise the whole
life-rhythm of the community. Production
being restored, it is claimed that the profits
of the pre-revolutionary concerns—in many
cases without the expert help of those who
created them —will be great enough to sup-
ply every employee with plenty of money
and plenty of leisure. It went down, for a
while, with the half-savage illiterates of
Russia; but as an argument directed at
educated White Australians it amounts to
an insult.
PLAIN ENGLISH.

No More Notes.
President Wilson passes off the stage ol'
international politics. He has intimated that
he will write no more notes to the Powers
of Europe, but will take a back seat and
be a reproachful back number. He will be
a skeleton absent from the feast and a ghost
that won’t walk, nor will his country be
represented like Banquo’s spectre on the
League of Nations. But though he is gone
from the international stage, the muddle that
he did lives after him. The eminently un-
satisfactory character of the Peace Treaty
was a concession to the incessant wagging
of his jaws and a higli price reluctantly
paid for support that never came. As the
prime mover in the Treaty and the repiv
scntative of the one defaulter from the
Treaty, he occupies the rare position of tin
man who deserted his wife before marriage.
Whether Wilson, now described as a very
sick and broken and melancholy man who
still refuses to abdicate, was quite compos
mentis at the time of his visit to Europe,
or whether Napoleonic imaginings drove him
partly off his base, is a matter for conjec-
ture. A man of unquestionably high prin-
ciples, he nevertheless certainly used his
position to play a confidence-trick upon the
nations of the earth. An outstanding feature
of the U.S. is that the Senate rejects well-nigh
every treaty almost as a matter of course.
Possibly this is to remind the President that
he is only a temporary worm, after all, or
possibly it is to give the one-third a chance
to be nasty and hostile. Whatever the rea-
son, Treaty-day is the minority’s one day
out. Sometimes the minority, having kicked
the Chief Magistrate pro forma and on prin-
ciple, changes its view next session and
adopts the treaty. But Wilson, whose
party had just been defeated at the polls,
going to Europe as a self-appointed plenipo-
tentiary with personally-selected colleagues
all from the discredited crowd, hadn’t the
vestige of a show from the first of getting
the Senate to agree with him. Yet if the
Allies had told him that he was a fraud, all
Yankeedom would probably have rallied
around him and made trouble for the Allies.
So they put up as best they could with the
lean man’s scorn and contumely. Thus he
gained the Iluns an easy treaty. He gained
them time to recuperate. He turned the
League of Nations into a joke—the poor
joke which makes a bride deserted at the
altar more grotesque than the spinster who
didn’t go to the altar. He demoralised such
of the League as remains. It might have
been, so far as the Great Powers went, a
vigorous Council of Four, but the long dwell-
ing of the unburied corpse of the fifth on
tlie premises paralysed its energies. So
Germany makes a truculent demand for a
new treaty. _ So there has even been coolness
between Britain and France. So there is
an obvious case of cold feet in Italy. The
interminable worry of the icicle from Wash-
ington has chilled all the old enthusiasms.
To what extent his nation will suffer in repu-
tation through his action remains to be seen.
It can, of course, stand by and laugh, if it
pleases, at the chaos which its President has
caused. It can, if it pleases, stand back
and laugh that its more than figurehead
should have been so trusted, should have been
so deferred to. But in that case, remem-
bering why he was deferred to, it is question-
able whether it will ever again command
not merely the confidence and respect of the
nations but even the full confidence of its
own best statesmen.

“Bending” a Railway.
A casual Parliamentary mention of the
north-to-south railway across Australia
Jdie S. M. Hekald to an article
(lb/4/ 20) which was a whole essay on the
low’ grade of political morality that prevails
in the over-bloated cities. Some samples:—
The Commonwealth is definitely pledged to build
a line; the agreement is embodied in the Federal
Act by which the Northern Territory was taken over
from South Australia in 1911. But the Act does
not specify the period within which the Common-
wealth must redeem its promise, nor does it pro-
vide for any particular route No doubt such a
line would do much to open up the Territory, but
at the best it would probably be long before it
became a paying proposition. Certainly this con-
summation would be still further postponed... .if
the “direct route’’ (that is to say, the one origin-
ally chosen by South Australia) were adopted. It
is now widely admitted that IB’ and when, the north-
south line is built it should be taken very much
to the east of the original survey, bending to the
borders of Queensland and New South Wales so
that it could link up with extensions of the exist-
ing western lines in those States... .The country to
be traversed is said to be quite as good as that
under the alternative scheme, while, instead of all
traffic to and from Darwin having to go round In
Adelaide, there would be direct communication with
Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane, Newcastle and
Sydney.
Anfi so on through much elaborate shuffle
and side-stepping. And this is the other or
Australian side of the case which the
Herald ignores :—•
There was no date fixed for the completion of
the transcontinental railway any more than there
was for the establishment of a Federal capital in
N. S. Wales, though the Herald and its kind arc
fond of calling any delay about the latter a “breach
of faith.” But S. Aus. handed over 523,090 square
miles, including much good, well-watered land ami
over 600 miles of railway and various other works
in return for two things—relief from a very small
debt and, what was much more important, the com-
pletion of the railway. In tact, it was to be a
land-grant railway, and the Commonwealth has got
the grant. To keep it without payment is robbery.


INCREASE IN PRICE.
The cost of printing paper being now
seven times greater than it was before
the war, THE BULLETIN regrets that
it is impossible to any longer publish
at the old price. On and after May 6,
1920, the price per copy will be NINE-
PENCE.
Subscriptions payable in advance will
be:—

Subscriptions which have not expired
by May 6, 1920, will, of course, con-
tinue at the old rate.
As soon as ever circumstances allow,
the old rates will be restored.
On the other hand, N. S. Wales gave only 940
square miles in consideration of getting a capi
So far a vast amount more has been spent
the capital than on the railway. Aet the lai way
is waited to shorten the journey from one sice o
Australia to the other by between 2000 anti ■
miles and save vast expense, while the ledeial capi-
tal at Canberra won’t save any expense or shorten
the road to anywhere. Also the railway is u-antec
for defence, and Canberra isn’t.
The proposed “bending” of the railway towards
(many propose to bend it into) N. S. Wales and
Queensland isn’t a scheme to carry it into
better country. The Herald only alleges that
the land on the new and longer route “very much
to the east” of the “direct route” is said to be as
good as on the older and shorter one. There is
desert to be crossed in each ease, but the bend will
make more desert to be crossed. The desert section
isn't expected to pay; therefore, the more desert the
worse the prospects.
Also, it is a childish misrepresentation to say
that the “bending” process “very much to the east ’
of the “direct route” will make it unnecessary for
all trade “to go round by Adelaide.” No known
inhabitant of any registered lunatic asylum in this
country proposed that all trade should go round by
Adelaide. It was always understood that the States,
when they felt inclined, would extend their lines
and join on.
So one question is whether the Commonwealth
will build the shortest and cheapest and most direct
line with the money of all Australia and let the
eastern States join on to it at their own cost, or
whether the Federal line will go “bending” at
increased cost and sacrifice of the advantage of
brevity in order to meet the lines from Townsville
and Rockhampton and other places which ought to
come to it. In other words, whether the Common-
wealth will do railway building for rich and greedy
States or let them do their own.
And another question is whether the Federal rail-
way, built with the money of all Australia, will
stick closely to its original purpose of opening up
and improving the Federal territory, which is the
property of all Australia, or go on a circumbendibus
eastward to improve the property of rich and greedy
States and thereby abandon its own business.
If N. S. Wales, the place which the Herald
is, of course, thinking about, is to get any
special advantage by the proposed breaking
or “bending” of faith with S. Aus., it will
be necessary to abandon almost wholly the
completed southern section of the north and
south railway (nearly 500 miles) and start
anew line to go north-east, then north,
then north-westerly. It would add perhaps
(500 or 1000 miles to the length of the com-
pleted line, and would, after all, only
straddle the driest and most hopeless corner
of the Ma State. In fact, there is very
little for Ma in the proposed swindle except
the pleasure of being nasty and un-Austra-
lian and blocking the progress of the great
Federal possession because the Northern
Territory isn’t in N. S. Wales, and the
gratification of that craze which demands
that everything shall come to Our State
whether it is of the slightest use there or
not. Further, there may be—apparently is
—the idea that, through much quibbling and
postponement, the work to which the Com-
monwealth’s honor is pledged, and which the
country’s safety and progress demand, and
for which South Australia paid so heavily,
will be abandoned altogether, even though
that course would he shamefully unpatriotic
and fraudulent.
Is the Army Reserve to Go?
The Defence Department refrains from
contradicting the widespread rumor that
“the Army Reserve scheme, which was started
shortly after the first members of the A.I.F.
began to return to Australia, is not to be
proceeded with”; though Ministers have
been several times invited to do so. The
Reserve idea struck this paper as fishy
when it was first put forward: if it is to
be now abandoned the thing will stand out
as a political manoeuvre of a particularly
discreditable kind. When the fit members
of the A.I.F. began to pour back to Aus-
tralia at the end of 1918 the Government
was faced with the problem of making use
of those officers and n.c.o.’s who had shown
brilliant capacity in the field. To scrap them
seemed insanely wasteful, the Common-
wealth being still alive to the horrible perils
of military inefficiency and unpreparedness.
But only a small proportion could be
absorbed into the C.M.F. without an amend-
ment of the Defence Act. Under the Act
promotion in the C.M.F. has to be got from
the ranks of the trainees. In other words,
the only A.I.F. men available for the Citi-
zen Forces were those who had been in the
< J.M.F. before embarkation for the Front;
and even they reverted, on return, to their
old rank. Thus the late Colonel Marks
would have been a C.M.F. lieutenant at the
time of his heroic death had he stayed in
the C.M.F. There was no room in the Per-
manent Forces for ex-A.I.F. men who had
not been regulars before enlistment. Or, to
put it more accurately, the pushing-in of
qualified men with active-service experience
would have involved the departure of num-
bers with no experience of modern warfare
—nor, in many cases, of ancient warfare
either. The great aim of all Governments
when general elections are imminent is to
do as little as possible and so avoid recrim-
ination. The Hughes Administration did
not want to amend the Defence Act in such
a way as to permit the appointment of ex-
A.I.F. officers and n.c.o.’s to the C.M.F.,
since that might have annoyed the senior
trainees; and it was taking no chances in
the matter of re-casting the Permanent
Army system. So, with the apparent object
of blanketing the inevitable demand for
such changes, the Army Reserve scheme was
put forward. The returning Diggers were
soothed, not to say flattered, with the assur-
ance that the Reserve was to be Australia’s
first line of defence. Doubts appeared when
the fact leaked out that it was proposed to
have less than a week’s training per year.
However, many keen young soldiers looked
on that provision as easily alterable, and
jumped in with enthusiasm. The obvious
thing for the Government to do in the
interests of military efficiency was to put
the most brilliant of the returned men who
were available either on to the A. and I.
staff or into responsible positions in C.M.F.
units, after altering the Defence Act in
such a wav as to make it legally possible.
But as military efficiency came a long way
after political necessity during most of last
year, the Reserve arrangement was persisted
in. Sine* 1 its chief organiser and Dte haad.
Colonel Kenneth Mackay. has just been
demobilised, there seems little doubt that
it is doomed. It has served its purpose,
and it will be nearly three years before the
country can register its opinion of the
authors of the trick.

The Law and Politics.
The Sydney daily press mentioned last week
that as a consequence of Mr. Holman’s
application for silk, at least four members of
the N.S.W. Bar will now apply to the Attor-
ney-General to make then K.C.’s. This pro-
cedure is known as crowding out the inter-
loper. During most of his strenuous life
Holman has been working, according to his
lights, in the service of the State. He left
the party where all his prospects of political
advancement lay on the Conscription issue;
and since then he has represented in the
Assembly the cause which is favored by a
vast majority of the barristers. His profes-
sion now hands him the usual reward. Judge
Cohen encountered the same spirit in the
same quarter when he went on the N. S.
Wales District Court Bench. It will not
be suggested by any reasonable person that
either Coiien or Holman is lacking in
ability. Litigants are likely to be as well-
served behind the ex-Premier as they are
being served before the ex-Speaker. The
opposition to the ex-polißcian is simply a
crude form of Union exclusiveness. There
are several stock adjurations amongst “right-
thinking people.” and one in most frequent
use is: “Men of brains and education must
be encouraged to enter Parliament.” The
advantage that the community would derive
from such encouragement does not call for
argument-. A large part of Australia’s pre-
sent troubles arises from a preponderance of
the other sort in its Legislatures. There is
no need, for the purposes of the present
discussion, to establish that Cohen and Hol-
man are priceless statesmen. They are no-
thing of the sort. But they are forceful
men of a high order of intelligence; and
it is desirable to attract more of their type
to public life. What prospect is there of
doing it if the great professions are to be
allowed to virtually boycott capable members
solely because they have served in Parlia-
ment? It is a question that bodies snob as
the Bar Association and the Incorporated
Law Institute might consider in the interests
of their own good repute, to make no men-
tion of the public good.

A Minister of Courtship.
To tbe baby bonus, which is an old Federal
institution now, N, S. Wales has added a
Minister of Motherhood and appointed to the
job Gregory McGirr, who isn’t a mother
and is never likely to be one. When he and
the Under-Secretary for Obstetrics have got
into their stride it will only require a
Minister of Courtship to make things fairly
complete., though there may also be room
for a Minister of Obsequies. It is really
a question whether the Storey Government
isn’t a shade too motherly. The Premier
complains bitterly that before he had been
in office much more than a week people
were complaining bitterly because he hadn’t
done things. In reality people were com-
plaining that, after promising to do in red-
hot haste two lifetimes of work, his utter-
ances were mostly a tired man’s warning
that people mustn’t expect much; in fact,
that in the circumstances they should
expect next to nothing. The tiredest of pre-
vious Premiei-s never started quite so early
to warn the State that he mustn’t be bustled.
Yet, according to his own account, Stqrey
has been busy. He has been overhauling
old collections of papers in Holman’s old
room. They include various U.S. State laws
about providing seats for female employees
(it seems hardly necessary to go across the
Pacific for advice on that subject) ; about
the payment of mothers’ pensions; about un-
sexing the feeble-minded ; and a lot of similar
matters. While he pondered over the foreign
papers and theories there are things right
here that don’t require pondering, but do call
for action. One concerns certain unfinished
railways which have been falling into decay,
eating up interest and earning nothing for
as much as five years because imported
materials haven’t come to hand and may not
come to hand even at a ruinous price for
another five years. Then the steel works at
Newcastle are in difficulties because the
steamers that serve them have a bad habit of
going aground in the neglected harbor. Also
the northern part of the State wants to
separate, yet the North Coast railway con-
nection is still forgotten. The Storey Ministry
came in with every chance that its I'fe might
be short. If its days were numbered that was
more reason to leave behind it the record
of a vigorous policy on the big brass and
iron things than to spend its brief span read-
ing up stories of unpleasant things that
some Yankee States are said to do to the
feeble-minded. The things that scientific
men would do to the feeble-minded are well
enough known without the head of a Cabinet
of 13, including a Minister for Mother-
hood, poring over them as his first duty.
After so many years in Parliament the Pre-
mier ought at least to have a fully-prepared
plan of what should be done about the
big things, and so should the Caucus. The
demand is more for a Tubal Cain than a
Sairet Gamp Ministry. Even if Storey
mixed the two and made it a Tubal G>mp
Ministry there would be less to complain
about; but it seems all Gamp. The appoint-
ment of a Minister of Courtship would cer-
tainly round it off.
The Eternal Irish Problem.
Dear Bulletin, —Recent events, including
the Derry riots, at which the parties threw
the famous old walls at each other for seven
days and nights, make me more than ever
convinced that England can’t both keep Ire-
land and save its soul. So I present my
remedy again:—
(1) To recognise the Irish Republic.
(2) To remove all Protestants and others who
desire to leave. The Republic to buy such property
as they can’t take with them at arbitration rates—
mostly with bonds, of course. (There are only
1,100,000 Protestants, including Jews and atheists,
and before the war Britain used to move 370,000
outward passengers yearly, making this a 36-morths
job. During the war it got accustomed to shifting
millions.)
(3) To recognise all Irishmen in the British
Empire as unnaturalised aliens and subjects of the
Irish Republic. They would nave no votes, no
seats in Parliament or any other public body, and
no liability for * naval or military service. Those
who applied for naturalisation and offered to abjure
the Republic would, of course, have their cases con-
sidered.
(4) To remove from the Empire and send back
to Ireland a sufficient number of Irish to make room
for the population returning from Ireland. In fact,
to make an amicable exchange of people. Probably
Ireland as a comparatively empty country would
take two or three for one. The Irish going home
would be compensated for their immovable property
out of the bonds issued by the Republic for property
left behind by the retiring Britishers. As it is
only a ferry trip between the countries it is probable
that this years surplus (£164,000,000) would far
more than pay for the double removal.
(5) After that, any difficulties which arose between
the two States would be settled in the regular way
—by arbitration if possible, the League of Nations
helping, and failing that by mutual blockade, bom-
bardment and other acts of war.
When Derry, quoted ad nauseam as the
stronghold of Union.sm, Protestantism and
Dutchwilliamism, puts up such a rousing
fight against the proposal to include it in a
separate Ulster (or, rather, part-of-Ulster)
Home Rule province, it doesn’t look as if
Lloyd George’s scheme of pacification is
any more pacific than its unfortunate pre-
decessors. Anyhow, if the Irish are as unfit
for self-government as some English people
imagine, then the results of the establish-
ment of the Republic would clear England
of much old aspersion, and England would
have the satisfaction of seeing the new State
get, at its own hands, all it deserved. That
idea should appeal to English Toryism. One
thing more seems certain. If war did at
any time break out with the new State,
Britain would never so far lose its temper
as to annex it again. Once is enough.—
Yours faithfully, James Edmond.
A Proposal to Subsidise Strikes.
Last week a Mrs. McNamara, the wife of
a Sydney laborer, giving evidence before a
basic wage inquiry, said: —
My husband gets £4 per week when in steady
work. Because of the strike last year we didn’t
average £2 per week.
After this witness had left the box
Mr. Foster, appearing for the Federated Unions,
said that he proposed to call evidence to show that
the basic wage of £3 17s. was grossly inadequate
to provide even a suggestion of comfort. The
evidence would disclose that to have a reasonable
standard of comfort a family of a husband, wife and
three children must have at least £7 to £8 per
week.
Mrs. McNamara’s evidence had disclosed an
appalling state of affairs. Two children slept
with her and her husband in-the same bed;
they had only a blanket and sheet to cover
them; their food was insufficient, and they
were in debt. On the following day the De-
fence Department issued its revised schedule
of military pay. A gunner or private will
begin at £3 a week, which includes all allow-
ances. Married men are to get a bonus of
(is. a week. The soldiers don’t regard it
as regal munificence, but, on the whole, as
their quarters and uniforms are cheap, they
are satisfied. Unless something unprece-
dented happens to the cost of living they
anticipate being able to rub along in reason-
able comfort. They have an advantage, to
begin with, over the McNamaras, inasmuch
as in their industry there are no strikes.
Their weekly pay is never halved. Mr.
Foster, of the Federated Unions, evidently
agrees that something equivalent to the £4
weekly, which is about what the soldier’s job
is worth, is a fair thing for unskilled labor.
There are two methods by which it can be
arrived at in what may be called the rest-
less industries —(1) by abandoning the
chronic strike foolishness; (2) bv doubling
all wages. Mr. Foster pays his humble
tribute to the plasticity of the basic-wage
fixers of N. S. Wales by calling for the
second arrangement. If the whole of N. S.
Wales proceeded on the assumption that
everyone was to go on strike during three
days of every week and get paid for the six
days, then the principle rniriit be equity
even if it wasn’t good economics. But
there is an enormous class which, like the
soldiers, is not in a position to strike. The
laborer who is paid double wages on the
assumption that half of them will be for-
feited to the holiday spirit scores over the
non-striker in all sorts of ways. He
either rests, to the advantage of his health ;
or he assists the family exchequer by going
fishing or engaging in some other more or
less remunerative line of sport. But what-
ever he does the cost of living must rush
upwards, to the detriment of the unfortunate
who does not devote half his time to loafing.
Mr. Justice Higgins.
The other day Higgins. J., was told by
the manager of a big Melbourne timber yard
that during the last few years there had been
a “noticeable showing down by employees”;
and the truth of it is as well known as
the G.P.O. clock. But having obtained this
statement of a notorious fact from Walter
Moore, of the yard aforementioned, his in-
tensely legal-minded Honor suggested that
the witness must be a liar, conscious or
otherwise, and he gave a reason why he
doubted, or professed to doubt, the employer’s
allegation. Hear him :
Mr. Justice Higgins remarked that so far every
allegation made to him in regard to slowing down
had evaporated on investigation. The waterside
workers were said to have unloaded fewer tons per
man in a given period than formerly. It turned out
that now the ships were larger and the holds deeper,
and the men had to carry the goods a longer dis-
tance. The manager of a shipping company ad-
mitted that there was no slowing down, having regard
to those facts.
Whether the unnamed shipping manager made
his admission under a pers’stent Higgins
cross-examination, for the sake of peace and
quietness in court, his Honor did not say.
Or whether the shipping manager and him-
self worked out their complicated question
on paper in court, and proved the answer to
their mutual satisfaction, his Honor did not
say. Nor did he instance any other of the
“every allegation made to him” which had
“evaporated on investigation.” Nothing indeed
is certain except that the comparison be-
tween the go-slow of timber-workers in an
unchanged yard and the go-slow of water-
side workers in unloading different ships
under altered conditions was a false comnari-
son to draw. Any man of business looking
for truth would have dismissed it as valueless.
The go-slow policy is preached by Labor
spokesmen, practised by their dupes, and
deplored by all the community—save Justice
Higgins. If his Honor hears of a reduc-
tion in the output per man at boot fac-
tories, hat mills or Government workshops
he doesn’t believe it—it will surely “evapo-
rate on investigation.” He is probably pre-
pared to argue that the loss of house-produc-
tion through a policy of no Saturday work
in the building trade would evaporate on in-
vestigation. In thus casting doubt, not to
say flat denial, on the reality of ea’ canny
in labor-union circles Justice Higgins is a
mischievous person. The puffed-up pedant
in a high position of trust always is a mis-

The Public’s Eye.
“Macquarie Street” on ophthalmic quacks:
At Mudgee (N.S.W.) John Joseph Watson, of
Coogee, trading as Dr. J. ,T. Itoss, has been fined
£■so for representing himself to be a doctor; and
on a charge of indecently assaulting a married
woman whom he was treating for eye trouble, he
was committed for trial. This man’s doings I de-
scribed for The Bulletin about a year ago in an
article on “The Public’s Eye”—an article which, by
the way, excited so much interest in the Victorian
capital that two 'vituperative replies appeared in
the same issue of the Australian Manufacturing
Jewellers, Watchmakers and Opticians' Gazette.
At this time “Dr. J. J. Ross,’’ who gave an address
at Coogee, had been taking big fees in the Forbes
district by pretending to cure cataract without opera-
tion, his modus operandi being the same as that
followed in the cities by chemists who are in search
of an ad., and who do not know, or don’t care,
about the harm likely to result to the patient.
The travelling quack’s practice in general is to
dilate the patient’s pupils with atropine, collect the
fee and move on. The drug enables the sufferer
from senile cataract to see a bit better for a time.
For this reason. The opacity in the lens is at first
central, the peripheral portions remaining fairly
clear. When the pupil is dilated by placing a few
drops of a solution of atropine in the eye, light
reaches the interior of the eye through the peri-
pheral parts of the lens; so the magic cure is at
once explained, and the improvement lasts just long-
enough to enable the ophthalniological experimental-
ist to get away with the plunder.
These scamps, who call themselves doctors, bring
the profession into disrepute in the country districts ;
and that frequently means that the disheartened
patient, feeling that nothing can be done for him,
submits to suffering and inconvenience which might
be quite avoidable. And obviously there is an
economic side to that; for the efficiency of the
patient is reduced and his value to the nation dis-
counted. So the matter is one of far more than
unfair competition rvith the qualified and registered
doctor, as the public too often assumes.

“Babee” : The Northern Territory will soon
be a place prohibited to all except million-
aires. I got my last bushel of wheat for
10s. 6d. My next bushel will cost me 18s.
6d. Potatoes are 7d. per lb., self-raising
flour 3s. per bag (51b.), tinned fruit 2s. per
tin, milk Is. Id. per tin, and other necessaries
in proportion. Part of the reason for the
rise in prices is that wages are enormous,
for the big wage and little work worm
has infected the wage workers of the Terri-
tory badly. One wharfie got his fortnightly
pay envelope - last week with £7B in it. And
even at £S per day wharfies deliberately
indulge in a go-slow policy for no other
reason than that “Vestey’s have plenty of
money and can afford to pay.” No wonder
the firm is sick of it all. It treated the
mfen well. They got meat at old. per lb.,
they had cool, airy barracks built for them:
they got shower-baths, electric light, wash-
ing troughs and good messrooms. Cool and
airy houses were built, with rents running
from 15s. to 255. These houses were better
than men can rent in Darwin for £2 per
week. A store was stocked with goods at
less than Darwin rates; there were tennis
courts and a swimming-bath, and the meat-
works were fitted with the latest and most-
improved machinery. Vestey’s proved that,
given proper conditions white men could
work as easilv and as comfortably in Dar-
win (which is the hottest part of the N.T.)
as anywhere else in Australia. But they
nave been treated so badly that other com-
panies will avoid Darwin. They will give
as their reason that the place is unlit for
white laborers, whereas the truth will be
that the average white laborer who is avail-
able is not fit for the country. Some day
the white Australian will wake up and
realise what a fool he has been. And the
white labor-leader of the South will have
to carry a large part of the responsibility for
the national tragedy that threatens, because
it is his foolish talk that these Northerners
have put into practice.

When there is a suspicion in his Honor’s
mind that the proposed divorce may please
both parties, instead of only one, the whole
thing becomes a sort of Machiavellian con-
spiracy or a Bolshevik plot, and has to be
squashed at once. It is a curious state of
affairs. No doubt the law as it stands,
with its holy horror of what it calls collu-
sion and its desperate fear of meeting the
wishes of both parties to the marriage con-
tract. is being correctly interpreted; but it
is a mad law. It might be frank about it
and call itself a measure for the multipli-
cation of illegitimate children and to popu-
larise abortion.
A bitter protest has been raised at Gharle-
ville. in a pastoral district 480 miles west
of Brisbane, about the dilapidated beef sup-
plied from the metropolis per medium of the
State butchery, and the complaint is bitterest
from the hospital. There are about 200,000
bullocks on the Government stations, but
live bullock has been fetching as much as
(Id. and Bd. per lb., horns and all, in the
Brisbane market, so the Government beasts
are sold to Private Enterprise there, or pos-

vate Enterprise meat cos. at 3d. to 34d.

has made animals rather scarce and very
poor, and many of them are inaccessible

in addition, the Government herds are not,
available to supply the shops (they are
almost the only beasts in Queensland which
are not available), because to sell them al
shop prices,would burst the stations, and to
charge them at market prices would burst
the shops—well, naturally there are diffi-
culties. Minister Hunter, who founded the
Government meat business, was a successful
business man in private life. Possibly be-
cause he foresaw trouble he appointed him-

ness. with an alleged profit on the stations
which sell their goods at top prices to Pri-

“T.W.W.”: Speaking at an A.N.A. ban-
quet a few weeks ago Pearce said there was
no need to go outside Australia for military
advice. Here is what Pearce actually did
a few days afterwards. Storeman Harring-
ton, of the Ordnance Branch. Adelaide, and
storeman Jack, of the same branch, Perth,
served throughout the war. .Tack rose to
the rank of major. Harrington to the rank
of captain. Their advancement was gained
for service in the field. Subsequent to the
signing of the Armistice both officers took
several courses of technical instruction in
England and France with a view to making
themselves valuable in the Australian Ord-
nance Service. They returned to Australia
a few weeks ago and -were offered the store-
man job they held on enlistment (salary
about £IBO per annum) or nothing. With
much disgust they accepted the latter. At
the same time Pearce was asking an ex-
Tommy n.e.o. in London, who had never
seen Australia, whether he would accept a
position in Australia with a commencing
salary of £250 per annum. Pearce, it
appears, was impressed with what the ex-
Tommy n.e.o. showed him at his depot in
England. Now what is the A.N.A. going to
do about it?
From a trustworthy man in the North: —
Bight through the North there is widespread dis-
satisfaction with the recently-enacted Queensland
Aborigines ordinance. We who are entirely dis-
interested know that to put the native into European
houses is to study neither his comfort nor his well-
being, and equally pernicious are most of the pro-
visions concerning the amounts of “white-man”
clothing to be provided. From the point of view of
health alone these rules are most unwise, as those who
have dealings with the natives in New Guinea and the
islands know. Scarcely less dangerous is the com-
pulsory holding back of three-fourths of Binghi'S
earnings, said amount to be handed to the Government.
The consequence of this apparently-wise provision
for teaching thrift is that, having little cash to
spend, Buyout runs into debt wdth the Chow store-
keeper at Burketown or Thursday Island, or wherever
he may be, and in the end, when he gets his money,
has to pay about four times the fair thing for
whatever he has bought, in addition to being in-
vited to spend tfcg surplus on women, grog or opium.
In the case of girls in service, they seek to get
ready money to spend by other and worse means. Thus
the law for the blacks’ protection is defeating itself.
“Expert Too” : Telegraphists are daily
handling traffic that is from 12 to 14 hours
on its journey from .sender to addressee. It
is quite true that telegraph business has in-
creased, hut not abnormally, and cer-
tainly not beyond the capacity of the lines
already in existence. It is all a matter of
management and skill in applying mechan-
ism. Much of our trouble arises from lack
of responsibility. Nobody can be called
to account if a telegram is held up on its
journey ovei’night; and if it never gets to
its destination the most you can expect is
a refund of your 9d. We must have close
on 15,000 miles of lines in use to-day, fully
half of which cannot pay the interest on
cost. These non-payable lines may be
termed “feeding” circuits for the main lines
joining the larger cities and centres of dis-
tribution. It is on these main circuits that
delay occurs, and it arises from many causes.
In the first place the wires are not sus-
pended on sufficiently substantial supports
to withstand ordinary bad weather. And
in the case of interruption we are not prompt
enough with the repair gang. In the second
place, we do not take any steps to accelerate
the flow of traffic when there is congestion
from interrupted circuits or other cause. A
Wheatstone transmitter is capable of a
speed varying from 40 up to 300 words per
minute. But to get the highest possible
efficiency, skill in management and mechani-
cal adjustment and arrangement are neces-
sary. Our managers and engineers have no
time for this fine point. They are re-

quired to devote 99 per cent, of their brains
to routine clerical work and officialism. And
the final result is that the public arrives at
its destination before the telegram it sent to
announce its departure.
“Spare Corporal” : The Red Cross Industries,
started for the employment of incapacitated
men, include toy-making, basket-making and
weaving, and are a complete success; so
much so that the employees, who are guaran-
teed a minimum wage but are paid by re-
sults, can make and are making as much as
£8 and £9 per week. Yet to get employ-
ment in the industries a Digger has to be
declared, after examination by the doctor,
unfit for his pre-war occupation and for
any ordinary employment. The industries
are to a considerable extent self-supporting.
They would have remained unstarted but
that the desire to do something for war-
wasted soldiers prompted enterprise; and
their success surely indicates that if some
enterprise were shown in organising indus-
tries for soldiers who are not incapacitated,
but are out of work, it would have good
results.
“Working Girl”: One way they have of
(not) dealing with V.I). in Victoria. The
departmental medical officers recently ex-
amined a suburban school. Certain scholars
showing “symptoms of what might be V.D.
were excluded until such time as they should
be healthy again. There, so far as Red-
tape was concerned, the matter ended. But
when one of the school staff arrived home
to dinner and found that one of the excluded
children was a boy living in the same
boarding-house as herself, her hair stood on
end. The parents being out, the boy was
haled off to the nearest doctor, who pro-
nounced him a case of Y.D. More devils
to pay! The occupants of the house bed
to consult their different medical advisers
and find out where they stood. In their
absence the case and his parents discreetly
flitted. iNow a dozen ultra-respectable but
much-rattled citizens are demanding of
each other and of all they meet why the de-
partmental M.O.’s are not given authority
to consign affected children to some institu-
tion set aside for the purpose.
There are still cranks in Australia who
imagine that vast compulsory issues of paper
money can be made without the thing taking
its revenge by depreciating —which means
sending up the cost of living. One of them.
Senator Gardiner, wants to issue 30 to 40
million more notes. Comparing 1913 with
recent figures Britain increased its note
issue by 244 per cent., and prices went up
257 per cent. Germany increased its issue
by 875 per cent., and prices went up
1000 per cent. Austria increased its issue
by 3900 per cent., and prices rose 4000
per cent. As for Russia, it went the limit:
the figures of its note issue are out of
sight, and a recent Australian visitor found
tea selling in Petrograd at £6O per lb. Even
the worst of these issues is “secured on all
the public and private assets of the coun-
try,” as the cant phrase goes, yet the increase
of prices was faster than the increase of
paper wealth every time. Senator Gardi-
ner’s proposed compulsory addition of about
£35,000,000 of unwanted paper to a stock
which is already over the mark wouldn't
make Australia a farthing richer. What it
would do would be to make every pound
earned by every one of Gardiner’s consti-
tuents worth only about 18s. or perhaps less.
“Moresby”: Does the Australian elector
ever think of his disfranchised brethren in
Papua in connection with the high cost of
living? The Australian in Papua has no say
in either Australian or Papuan affairs; he is
resident in democratic Australia’s first over-
sea territory, and for trying to develop a
brown man’s country into a home for good
White Australians his mates in Australia
deprive him of his birthright—the franchise.
And to further express their gratitude they
treat Papuan produce in a similar manner
to the produce of Java and Japan. To pro-
vide further inducement to intending settlers,
in Papua the local Government imposes a
tariff of from 10 to 25 p.c. on imports from
Australia. Surely these tariffs, levied by
one part of the Commonwealth against
another, are entirely anti-Federal, not to
say foolish! Why should we Australians
who live in an Australian territory be penal-
ised for buying Australian produce any more
than any other Australian? And if Aus-
tralia is "going to benefit by having a tropical
territory, why penalise itself by charging
duty against our products? What justifica-
tion is there for putting us on a different
footing from the Northern Territory? If the
legislator in Melbourne replies that we have
a colored population, I respond that the
Northern Territory has a colored population,
too. and works some of its meat-growing
runs with them exclusively. But you don t
think of barring N.T. beef on that account.
The House Famine Creators’ Union was
formally sued in a Sydney court on the plea
that its" resolve to reduce the supply of houses
hv refusing to work or let any of its mates
work on Saturday amounted technically to
a strike. In the debate a great deal was
said about “fixing the week’s work” at 48
or 44 or 40 hours. This is putting the
cart previous to the horse. There is no
overwhelming reason why the week’s work,
in return for a certain fixed wage, shouldn't
tie 40 hours, or even 30 hours as demanded
by the strikers of Broken Hill, provided men
are allowed to do two weeks’ work in
the seven days and to get 400 per cent, more
wages. There is plenty of work waiting to
be done. Australia provides itself witli a
sufficiency of hardly anything save wheat,
wool, butter and meat. The demand put
forward by the Brickleavers’ Union and other
bodies for a 40-hour week is really a demand
for 128 hours’ stoppage, and the stoppage
being a great deal the bigger and the more
compulsory of the two, and being more-
over whole-souled and genuine and undeni-
able while the work may be slipshod and
sluggish, it is the stoppage that should lx l
featured and have the name-part in the
proceedings.
Among the things that the new Ma State
(Government has found out is that 23 far-
mers at Penrith are being put off their hold-
ings, the latter being compulsorily pur-
chased, in order to make room for 50 re-
turned soldiers. The story is probably
true: that sort of thing has been happening
all over Australia. In this case it is said
that the men who are being put off. though
mostly experienced, have had as much as
they could do to make a living; so appa-
rently the idea is that inexperienced men can
make a living on half the old men’s area.
The chances are that production will largely
decrease, but the bill for the land, and for
the returned soldiers’ sustenance while they
were discovering that the job won’t support
them, will remain. Meantime in cities
which grow wool right up to their back-
door a decent suit of clothes costs £lO or
£l2, and tweed is so scarce that when a man
has a little he is rushed by buyers. Nothing
is clearer than that Australia needs more
woollen goods of dozens of sorts; and to
find room for a man at making woollens a
more experienced man wouldn't have to be
pushed out. It is the same with a hundred
other lines; but the State can’t raise a
thought beyond “putting men on the land”
—even if it has to throw some more experi-
enced men off the land to do it.
“Spare Corporal”: Many of the thousand
or more ex-I)iggers who are said to be
stranded in Britain are victims of Britain's
own repatriation activities; and, to a large
extent, their stranding is their own fault.
While the war was raging men who had t"
be released from military service because of
unfitness were rushed by employers in Eng-
land. Jobs were plentiful, girls were kind,
and the A.I.F. man saw a chance of having
a glorious time on the reputation of himself
and his cobbers. The A.I.F. authorities did
all they could to discourage the tendency to
ask for discharge in England, and before
granting it made the dischargees sign a
document relinquishing all claim on the
Commonwealth. Of course, when the de-
mobilisation of the British Army came, tin*
onus of finding work for the Tommies return-
ing to civil life was upon the employers:
and as, even at the best, there were not
enough jobs to go round, the temporary
Australian who imagined he was permanent
has had to go.
“3004”: At first sight “Ex-Dig’s” claim
(B. l/4/’2O) that the Repat. Department
ought to be made an open door to the Com-
monwealth service looks reasonable; but it
disregards one important factor. The Re
patriators did not pass a qualifying exam.
It' they are to be admitted without competi-
tive exam., they should come after fat
returned soldiers who were in the service
when they enlisted, and (b) soldiers who
. have entered the service by exam, since their
return. Otherwise we shall be faced with
the possibility of various “spare parts'
from the Repat. coming into the fourth and
higher classes of the Commonwealth service
(so as to retain something like their present
status and salary) over the heads of the men
who also fought and who have a qualification
Which the Repats, don’t possess.


Empire Defence and the Safety of Australia.
Mr. Amery, TJnder-Secretary for the
Colonics, in giving an outline of the naval
defence proposals for the Empire, stated that
it had been decided to adopt “a new system,
consisting of a defensive chain, of which
each link will he primarily equipped to sus-
tain its own defence
Naval Defence is, to Australia, of grave importance, and calls
for preparedness with ships of war, guns and munitions.
Australia cannot risk her safety by dependence upon others
to supply her needs in these directions. The facilities for
their manufacture in case of necessity must be established
here. This makes essential the development, on a sound
basis, of the
Australian Iron
and Steel Industry
apart altogether from the economic aspect of the question.

POLITICA
POINTS
From the Federal Gallery: —
Fissures in the Country party are becoming notice-
able, and the independent manner is visibly waning
in places where strong individual opinions were
looked for. The other night an amendment by Parker
Moloney aimed against the duplication of pensions
departments under the Repatriation Bill should have
commanded the unanimous support of Cocky, merely
on the ground of the economy he was elected to
achieve; but Jowett and Prowse deserted and just
saved the Government from an embarrassing defeat.
Probably the two will try to justify their votes in
caucus, but they have plainly shaken ' the party’s
solidarity and created a precedent for other Hay-
seeds to follow. The Government is not surprised:
the most cynical member of the present Administra-
tion says that the Labor bogey is a good-enough
weapon to belt Cocky into any frame of mind. Old
hands already predict that in a few months the
Corner will explode from dissension, and that the
Nationalists will proceed to swallow the fragments.
One of the first things the Storey Govern-
ment did was to instruct its Attorney-
General McTiernan to find out whether
Davey Hall was made fast in his Agent-
General’s job for a term of years. The
youthful McTiernan called in two learned
brothers, and apparently the advice was that
David, though a lawyer and member of a
Cabinet which was mostly lawyer, had gone
off without being well clamped to the job. So
it lias been decided to recall him (he hadn’t
then passed America) ; but whether it is to
tell him that he hasn’t got the job or to
instruct him in what his duties are now that
he has a Labor Ministry to represent isn’t
yet clear. Probably Ministers won’t know
themselves till they see David’s hand. If
they decide that Hall shouldn’t have been
appointed by a Government that was on the
point of making an appeal to the people,
they will still have an awkward hurdle to
face; for if, as Storey says, the Govern-
ment must wait to do things until it gets
a majority, and as Dooley talks of another
appeal to the people, it doesn’t seem as if
the present Government has any more right
to send a man to London for a fixed term
than the old one had.
X. S. Wales’s new Chief Secretary Dooley
comports himself like a fierce undertaker —
a mixture of fire and misery. “I believe,”
said he at a recent function, “that the people
of Australia to-day are in as bad a state as
any country in the world.” There are some
pretty miserable countries —Armenia, for
instance. And if Dooley’s State is as bad
after 20 years of one-adult-one-vote in
Federal matters, and 27 years of one-man-
one-vote in its own matters, and six Federal
Labor Ministries and six consecutive years
of Labor Government in Sydney, and the
Labor machine and caucus and the Trades
Hall and the Worker —well, Dooley had
better give up hope and tie a volume of
Hansard to himself and cast his sorrows
into deep water. Why struggle against
Fate and bash one’s head against the inevit-
able for a mere £l5OO or so per annum?
Every day Premier Storey throws out a
pearl. The other morning it was this: —
The employers make the mistake of trying to
speed lip the individual workman. This makes every
worker suspicious of his fellow, creates dissension
and paves the way for strikes. Has it never occurred
to the employers that they might be able to get the
increased production they want by entering into a
collective agreement with the men?
Yes, it has occurred to them often. Only
just before Storey spoke, for instance, Tees-
dale Smith bad tried to enter into a collective
agreement with the men on numerous big
jobs. To get the increased he
bad offered three-fourths of the profit from
the job, while he stood all the risk of a
loss. And the Labor Council advised the
unions to have nothing to do with the
scheme. Premier. Storey ought to have
talked plain Australian to that council and
those unions, but he didn’t, The working
man doesn’t want to do wrong. He is as
honest as the employer. If he is so often
utterly wrong it is because the men who
ought to guide him are concerned only to
tell him what it will pay them to tell him
and confirm him in his wrong opinions.
An importer, giving evidence before the
Fair Profits Commission in Melbourne, said
that he acquired a lot of Australian tweed
at 6s. 6d. per yard and was rushed with
an offer of 16s. 9d. Evidently there is a
big local demand to be filled. The Repat-
riation Department might consider advanc-
ing money to put men on looms instead of
on land. There is more in it. Nobody who
buys wheat at ss. per bushel is rushed with
an offer of 13s.
The usual unemployed deputation waited
on N.S.W. Minister Cann even before he
had hung up his hat in his new office.
(Owing to the Broken Hill strike, which has
affected 100,000 people for a year, and the
seamen’s strike and the marine engineers’
strike and the drought and the importation
of everything, unemployed are fairly plenti-
ful.) Mr. Cann said ‘‘the idea was to con-
struct reproductive works” —the kind that
will pay 6 per cent, interest and working
expenses. The Bulletin here suggests one
reproductive work which won’t cost 6 per
cent. Last year Australia exported
£31,479,990 worth of greasy wool, half of it
from Cann’s State, which meant that
N.S.W. paid freight needlessly on about
40,000 tons of valuable dirt and lost the
dirt. Let us wash the stuff. It is a job

that comes every year, while building the
line to Rabbitburgh only happens once, and
is liable to be a grief ever after.
The unscientific, farcical inquiries into
basic wages and the like go on, wasting
money and doing far more harm than good.
Last week in a Sydney inquiry a witness, a
clerk, living in a two-roomed flat, testified
that he “required,” amongst other things,
three hats per annum, “one at 255. and two
at a guinea each.” He may. It is possible
to imagine men who need new hats every
week in order to keep their self-respect above
water. But if the witnesses are not fairly
typical they are valueless; and so is the
social survey which is based on such absurd,
haphazard evidence.
Queensland’s new law fixes Fair Rents
at not more than they were on October 1,
1919, and not more than 10 p.c. of the value
of the property. Government securities, carry-
ing certain exemptions from taxation, can
now be bought to yield 6J or p.c. So if a
man prefers to buy house property for let-
ting purnoses there is a margin of about 3i
p.c. to cover local rates, taxes and repairs',
loss by emptiness, bad tenants, riot, fire or
flood, and personal injury while trying to col-
lect the money; also to pay for a new build-
ing when the old one wears out, becomes
obsolete or is eaten by white ants. If the
Government was borrowing at 4 p.c. the Fail-
Rents might be tempting. As it is some
people will prefer Government securities.
And other people will have to doss under
trees.
Seeing that the new Government is going
to hold another inquiry re the Sydney
I.WAV. prisoners, why not give all prisoners
a new trial? There are plenty who haven’t
had half so many trials as the I.W.W. men.
Though they may not be bad enough to excite
the same sympathy, it is wrong and a mere
popularity-hunting dodge to make fish of one
and flesh of the other.
The Defence Department is simply not
honest with the public. Recently, in reply
to a public outcry against the d'israting of
officers who had won distinction in the field,
it explained certain changes which it said
had been made, and proceeded:—
A Duntroon graduate who left Australia as a
lieutenant and became a lieut.-colonel in the A.I.F.
will thus automatically become a brevet-major, his
substantive rank being that of captain.
First, the impression is given that a Dun-
trooner was permitted to become a lieut.-
colonel in the A.I.F. It is notorious, how-
ever, that an order was issued that no Dun-
trooner, no matter how brilliant and capable,
should be promoted beyond major. Second,
instead of these officers becoming captains
and brevet-majors •‘automatically,” at least
one-half of the first-year men are still
lieutenants. What confidence can the public
give to an administration capable of such
misrepresentations ?
If Australia wants to get the full benefit
of the increase of production which every-
body prattles about it will probablv have to
drown the Controller of Shipp iig first.
Heaven only knows why there should be any
controller of shipping; but there is, though
apparently the only effect (besides supply-
ing a few people with lucrative jobs) is to
make chaos of the whole export business.
Though ships have been going away with
space unfilled, goods of Australian produc-
tion have been lying on Australian wharves
for as much as 12 weeks awaiting shipment;
and though the shipping offices say they
could handle the stuff all right the controller
stands in the way—not deliberately, of
course, but just because his department is
inept and chaotic. One result is that a
market for Australian goods is being lost;
for naturally buyers will refuse to look this
way if they can’t tell to within six months
or so when the goods they have bought are
going to arrive. So bad has the position
become that shippers have actually nego-
tiated to send stuff to Batavia, to be sent
on thence by Dutch liners to Europe.
The old Stinking-Fish nuisance used to be
a Tory, but that dreary and limited person,
having said all he could think of and a great
many things besides his prayers, has prac-
tically dropped out exhausted. The union
secretary has taken his place. One of the
brand in Perth has been writing to Eng-
land warning white British workers from
coming here, as work is scarce and the place
isn’t fit for them. A country with less than
two people to the square mile—the secre-
tary’s own State has one to 3£ square miles
—must be an awful desert and a misman-
aged one at that if it can’t hold a few
more, and a place which imports £90,000,000
worth of goods in a year certainly seems
to have £90,000,000 of possible work lying
about.
Geo.. Swinburne, alleged Protectionist, one
of Victoria’s Electricity Commissioners,
when asked how long it might be before Mel-
bourne wquld be able to buy brow n -coal
briquettes from the Morwell deposits, said
‘‘two years, because the plant cannot be
obtained from abroad yet.” It is of no con-
sequence that there are engineering firms
in Australia eager to build the plant here
and set it going inside 12 month's; and as
for plans, the Commissioners already have
them, and a model of a Hun briquetting
outfit as well. Why not go the whole hog
and import briquettes? There would be no
pretence of Protection about that, anyway.
Australia ought to be getting pretty sick
of Royal Commissions. At the best they
were, as a rule, only stalls—a nand.v way of
keeping the public quiet. Now tliev don’t
even do that. In S. Aus., which has the
habit badly, it seemed as though it might be
due to the other habit of appointing a mere
magistrate to do the job; but
in N. S. Wales, where the conviction of the
I.W.W. incendiaries was referred to one of
the most trusted of Supreme Court Judges,
the only people who weren’t already con-
vinced that the men had had a fair trial
remain unconvinced, and the Storey Govern-
ment has invited Ewing, one of the newest
of Judges from the smallest of the States, to
sit in judgment on liis elder, bigger brother.
Apparently Storey picked on Ewing because
he opened the recent Commission in Darwin
in his shirt-sleeves.
“D.J.”: Some time ago the Queensland
Government threatened to take another
referendum on the question of abolishing tne
House of Old Ideas. Each member of the
Assembly (72) was voted £2OO to pay his
campaign bills. The ’flu arrived just then,
and the whole business was dropped. But
members hung on to the £2OO all the same.
The steamer Roggeveen, for Java ports,
took SO cases of macaroni. This is a local
manufacture which owes everything to the
war, and yet should have been an established
industry in this wheat-producing country
long since. Imports of macaroni, often
weevily or ranc.d, were a regular feature
of Australian pre-war trade, and as the
stuff - came from cheap-labor countries, a local
product never had a chance. Now, though
it is confined to a few firms, the busi-
ness is full of motor-cars. In Melbourne
the Rinaldi family, formerly of Daylesford.
has made a mountain of trade out of its
pre-war macaroni mole-hill, and others have
also taken substantial profits, with satisfac-
tion to all parties but the importing agents.
Still, while printing such suggestive informa-
tion as that relating to the Roggeveen’s cargo,
the Argus continues crazily to advocate the
abolition of any form of continued Protec-
tion for war-fostered enterprises.
The Labor Call, Melbourne, has printed
without comment the following excerpt from
the epistle to the Ephesians:—
Let him that stole steal no more; hot rather
let him labor, working with his hand the thing
that is good, that he may have whereof to give to
him that hath need.
It is good of the Call to remind the Satur-
day-loafing builder of the urgent need of
more dwellings.
From another old Victorian political hand:
Re “Talk of the Vie. State Lobbies” (B. 15/4/’2O).
Frequenters of the lobbies during recess are few, and
their opinion is not representative. As to the sug-
gestion that Mackinnon might become leader, he
would be acceptable to but few. Peacock can have
the leadership if he have courage and independence.
But he mustn't be saddled with McLeod and Living-
stone. Any reconstruction will have decided oppo-
sition. Country members are especially alert just
now, and they do not look upon the Lawson com-
bination with a kindly eye. With Robinson, Clarke
and McWhae in the Leg. Council and McPherson
and Mackinnon in the Assembly, the opinion held
is that city influences and the Melbourne Club
already have too great a pull over the Government.
The strong belief of the Farmers’ Union that Hut-
chinson, Campbell and Pennington will be thrown at
the general elections further weakens respect for
Lawson and his team. The feeling throughout the
country districts is in favor of a new administration.
Sydney Corporation, which has a very
healthy debt already, is floundering with a
big loan it is trying to contract in
the United States. In London, where the
education rate alone goes as high as 2s. in
the £1 of rental value, and police, lunatics
and other charges which are not local here
run things up till one London borough
(Poplar) had to sky its separate charges
to 13s. 7d. in the £l, with the county rate
on top of that, borrowing for public works
may be necessary. With half these figures
Sydney should be out of debt and have at
least two harbor bridges paid for, and be
clearing the debt off a municipal tramway
system. The North might not feel so angry
and secessionist about paying for the gay
metropolis if the gay metropolis paid for
itself.
The new State of Armidale, which is
being made out of the northern part of
N.S.W., expects to start its career with a
population of 450,000. It will thus have a
better claim to individuality than any other
State commenced with. N. S. Wales had
about 270.000 people when its first Respon-
sible Ministry took office : Victoria, 347,000;
South Aus., 100.000; Tasmania, 70,000;
Queensland, 28,000; Westralia (it didn’t be-
come Responsible till 1890), 48,500. Pro-
bably Armidale will have a few more people
than it expects, foi- it seems doubtful whether
the scheme of taking over a rich triangle
(Newcastle to Goodooga) and not taking the
burden of the barren land behind will pass
muster. A great deal depends on whether
the Separationists, when they hold their
convention, will have the courage to go the
wiiole. hog, and draft a Constitution and
establish a Government. Some apologetic
brethren say that Armidale won’t go in for
unconstitutional measures, but as the Con-
stitution doesn’t provide any measures, what
else can Armidale do?
A DIRGE OF DEPARTING SENATORS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"One-half of the Senate will retire on June 30,
and the places of many of the old members will
be taken by new men who defeated them at the
last general election.”
The seats are plush, the soft lights glow,
The President upon us beams,
But all the time our sad souls know
There is an end to days of dreams —
Into the night we all must go.
We dwell in some grey world apart;
Feeling Oblivion by our side,
Our tongues have lost their cunning art,
Much longer here we may not bide;
The bailiff sits in every heart.
The thread is lost, the bubble burst,
The scheme of life fast fades away;
We tread in fear like men accursed,
And dread each naked, shameless day
Which shouts: “He comes—July the First 1”

Probably no bank iu the world has ever been
conducted as this one is: it has no board of
directors and is virtually under the sole com-
mand of its Cabinet-appointed Governor,
Denison Miller, who from comparative ob-
scurity as chief-inspector of the Bank of
X. S, Wales has in a very few years become
the most talked-of and most powerful banker
iu the Commonwealth. Every other bank
management is obliged to report regularly
to its shareholders, and though every man,
woman and child in the Commonwealth has a
proprietary interest in the business which
Denison Miller runs, they learn practically
nothing about its affairs. All the Act requires
is the regular presentation of balance-sheets,
hall-marked by the Auditor-General. Since
this high dignitary has complete powers
under the Act to inspect and audit, the bank’s
live million-odd constituents can rest assured
that the accounts presented are all they pur-
port to be. Still, Denison Miller is missing
the finest opportunity that ever came a
banker’s way. Probably about one in 100
of the proprietors of his concern understand
thie first principles of banking, and the 09
know less of how closely inter-related are the
affairs of the banks and of the continent.
The average bank chairman’s address is a
dull affair, which views current events mostly
as they affect vested interests. Denison
Miller has the chance of enlightening the
uninitiated into the mysteries of his big
figures, and, since he is free of political con-
trol, he has also the still greater opportunity
of leading the Australian public along the
path of sane finance. During recent years
many English and American banks have
adopted the plan of publishing a quarterly
review of national and private financial
operations. A regular review of the affairs
of the Commonwealth by Denison Miller,
with, perhaps, Statistician Knibbs in col-
laboration, would be of incalculable value.
If there is any complaint to be made
concerning the Commonwealth Bank it
is this lack of information concern-
ing its operations, particularly during such
an abnormal period as w T e are at present
passing through. The huge movements in
the _ assets during the past short term
of six months are alone very good reasons
why a little information should be forth-
coming :

The Commonwealth Bank is, of course, quite
unlike any other Australian bank, for it
holds the whole of the Federal Government’s
loose cash, and is banker also for three State
Governments, and the operations of the
former Are. so large that violent fluctuations
in the aggregate figures are to be expected.
The other side of the balance-sheet is much
less informative than most other banks’
accounts: apart from its own funds (accumu-
lated profits) there are only three ‘ entries,
Government and private deposits being
piled in one heap. The comparison of the
figures is taken back to 1014 to show the
remarkable growth since the opening of the
war:—

Deposits, etc. £4,559,264 £43,672,183 £39,330,772

Accumulated profits Nil* 1,922,970 2,363,500
£36,996.
So far as its earnings are concerned the
management could not say less: one line
merely states that net profits were so-and-so,
that is all —the profits of the trading
and savings departments being lumped.
Though the Auditor-General usually says
very little about the operations, in his
latest report he did show that of the
£1,922,970 profits accumulated to June 30
last, £196,438 had been contributed by the
Savings branch. The figures are worth a
place here: —

1919 .. .. 734,597 112,347
From the foregoing it will be seen that
Australia’s most important bank is also its
most silent bank; and it should not be so.
Unlike the privately-owned concerns, the
Commonwealth Bank has nothing to fear
from fully detailing its operations. On the
other hand, it has much to gain by a state-
ment of its activities —of the services, for
instance, which it performed on behalf of the
Commonwealth Government and its people
during the war period. Little has been
said, either, of what it is doing in other
directions —of how it is giving friendly and
other non-profit societies savings bank in-
terest on their funds and permitting them
the full use of cheque-bank facilities, and
soon.
It is even less talkative about future
policy. It has grown iu a very few years
from a baby into a huge concern with over
2.} millions of funds, and it is going to grow
very much larger. With the war out of the
way, Denison Miller now lias an opportunity
of giving some attention to the expanding of
its activities. Apparently he decided long
ago that it would be poor business from
the point of view of the Commonwealth gen-
erally to add to the number of banks chasing
business outside the metropolitan areas, and
that the better plan would be to try to absorb
concerns already widely established. As
The Bulletin mentioned a few’ weeks ago,
one such absorption has been under discus-
sion, and it is now understood that arrange-
ments have been finalised for taking over
the Commercial of Tasmania. One much
larger deal is talked of, and it would not be
surprising to find one of the widely-connected
Melbourne concerns bought out. It would
be even less surprising to find the Common-
wealth’s coat-of-anns over the Westralian
Bank’s door one day. Meantime the Fisher
Government’s original scheme of taking over,
the State savings banks is being proceeded
with, the Queensland institution being the
latest to be brought into the fold.

Wunderlich, Ltd., manufacturers of ceil-
ing and roofing materials, etc. Apparently
the co. paid £64,289 for goodwill, and later
items brought the total to £65,702, at w’hich
figure it now stands. In the following table
goodwill is not reckoned as an asset:—

During the past 12 months over £120,000 of
new capital was got in, and though an
amount equal to only half of it received a
full 10 p.c. for the year, that rate of dividend
absorbed practically all of the visible pro-
fits. Of course the management did not have
the use of the new funds for anything like
the whole of the period, but to pay 7 p.c. to
the prefs. and 10 p.c. to ordinaries will hence-
forth call for £35,600, so there will need to
be a spring in visible profits to manage that.
Conditions in the building trade are so ab-
normal. and the future so obscure, that it
certainly would not be safe to regard 10 p.c.
as assured. Prices are getting further and
further beyond the reach of the average man
who wants to sit under his own Wunderlich
roof; and with first mortgages threatening
to cost 7 p.c. or more, the opportunities of
even the spec, builder who requires only
.small deposits from purchasers do not look
too promising. The unexpected may happen,
hut it does seem too much to expect the sub-
urban building boom to be maintained in
the face of (1) continually increasing prices
of materials; (2) insufficient—and, con-
sequently. costly—labor ; (3) dearer money;
14) inflated land values; and (5) the prob-
lems w’hich will arise from our desperately
tangled finance. On the other hand, so many
concerns have done well out of the war, and
the tariff has given others an incentive to
hit out, that, perhaps, city-building and fac-
tory operations may not be affected to any
great extent. But one aspect, of the Wunder-
lich business which must not be overlooked is
that, despite the- large additional funds got
in and the wide expansion of interests during
recent years, net profits are not nearly so
good as they used to be. There is no denying,
of course, that the co. has so far had a very
successful career: for, after fairly good divs.
have been paid, in a dozen years the £05,702
of capital formerly represented by goodwill
has been replaced by something more tangible,
and, in addition, £58,000 of reserves have
been piled up. Latest disclosed results, how-
ever, are the more disappointing because dur-
ing the co.’s previous financial year, three
established businesses —Durabestos, Ltd..
Wunderlich and Steelart, Ltd., and Grant
and Cocks, Ltd. —were taken under the
Wunderlich wing, but their operations have
so far had a very' mild effect on disclosed
earnings.
In one respect the introductory table does
not present the profits position quite fairly.
Some years ago the Wuhderlichs decided to
introduce an employees’ profit-sharing scheme
into their business, and these appropriations
have been made to provide what are termed
“staff partners’ certificates” and to pay divs.
and bonuses thereon :
1915 .. £465. I 1918 .. £2328
1910 .. 800 | 1919 .. 7215
1917 .. 977 | 1920 .. 2450
But even adding these amounts to the figures
shown in the first table, recent performances
have not been so good as those of six years
or so ago, particularly when the additional
capital put into the business and the sub-
stantial surplus profits accumulated are
taken into consideration. One effect of the
latest funds has been a big reduction in
liabilities: —

Since 1912 £217,075 of capital has been
called in. Of this £98,309 has gone into pro-
perty and £74,906 into plant; while stocks
have grown by £80,420 and book debts by
£28,377. Whether assets arc conservatively
valued or otherwise is. not hinted at in the
accounts. Also all depreciation allowances
are made in the dark, one line in the accounts
alone giving what the directors consider to
be the net profits for any year, If more
than ample is being written off assets, then
actual results may have been better than
those admitted ; but there is nothing in the
reports to suggest that that has happened.

the labelling of reserves as nominal. Though
the co. recently closed its 32nd year, it has
been only during the past seven that any
attempt has been made to write down the
intangible goodwill asset. Originally it
stood in the books at £60,000, but, with the
striking off of the latest £2500, it has now
been got down to £5OOO. The £55,000 of
profits which has been used to reduce good-
will is included in the written-off column
above, but besides this amount other ap-
propriations for depreciation of leaseholds
and rolling-stock are also included. In fact,
as the movement of the reserves indicates,
practically all surplus profit after paying
dividends lias been used to write down vari-
ous assets during recent years. Before dis-
closing latest profits—which provided £2500
to reduce goodwill. £750 against leaseholds
and £4OOO for writing off plant—£l3,s27 had
already been laid out on plant and rolling-
stock repairs, in buildings and to provide
for doubtful debts. Though nominal re-
serves have shown very small growth over
many years, the co.’s position has been
strongly reinforced. Taking the £60,000
of goodwill into consideration, the 1912
balance-sheet showed that £lO,OOO of the
quarter-million paid capital was represented
by nothing more tangible than goodwill.
Now, however, the whole of the capital is
represented by substantial assets, and there
is £49,602 of true reserves besides. That
is. provided the value of fixed assets is all
the management claims after deducting what
has been set aside for depreciation. _ The
£49,602 of reserves does not include £57,050
shown as a special freehold depreciation re-
serve. Ten years ago the hook value of
fixed assets, less depreciation reserve, was
£429,862; at the latest balance £360.170.
Meantime, the co. has put up a good per-
formance in building up its liquid assets,
and at the same time reducing its liabili-
ties :
1910. 1915. 1920.
Assets apart from fixed
assets .. .. £57,141 £143,683 £153,243
Liabilities .. .. 232,136 240,828 193,290
Excess liabilities .. £174,995 £97,145 £40,053
An improvement of £134,942 is something to
be proud of, for though debts are still heavy
(£150,000 is owing on debentures and £42,970
on sundry trading accounts) the co. is now in
the position of being able to meet all but
£40,000 of its liabilities with its stock, book
debts, cash and investments.
As the first column in the introductory
table shows, trading has not been nearly so
profitable since war troubles intervened. But
South Australia and the Barrier (which this
co. moistens) were having a boom time six
and seven years ago, and these conditions
helped the How of beer. The middle State,
however, was the first to set out to win tin-
war with six o'clock closing, and that and
other troubles promptly put an end to the
co.’s good run. Since then additional excise
duties have been levied, costs have all the
time, been on the increase, and profit-earning
in breweries throughout the Commonwealth
has become more and more difficult. Never-
theless, though the Broken Hill strike re-
sulted in that branch of the South Alls.
Brewery showing a loss for the first time in
its history, the co. had a remarkably good
run during the past 12 months, and disclosed
profits were slightly better than in any year
since the war. If profits can be maintained
at their present level there will lie a handy
margin over and above 10 p.e. dividend dis-
tributions. But much depends on how South
Aus. comes through the difficult years ahead
and what tin- State decides to do with its
liquor problem. If it were not for tin- wine
industry South Australia could see its duty
clearer. Hardly anywhere else in the world,
perhaps nowhere, is the mostly-teetotal
Methodist Conference so great a power. But
the State is also a frugal soul, and it will
think hard before it destroys the value of its
33,000 acres of vines—as much, approxi-
mately, as all the other States have put to-
gether.

liothwell’s, Ltd., marks its coming-of-age by
a record profit. But it did not have to be
unusually pushful to attain that, for selling-
conditions have been so favorable that
records show up in practically every fresh
balance-sheet which reaches The Bulletin
from such cos. With tens of thousands of
Diggers collecting their deferred pay and
hastening into civvies, and the public gener-
ally making a splash with its own lOU.
these cos. could not help doing very well.
The chief trouble has been to secure stocks.
Notwithstanding the further increased cost
of goods the book value of Rothwell stocks
at January 31 last was smaller than 12
months previously. Funds being insufficient
to keep the shelves fully stocked, and the
whole of the authorised capital having been
got in, the directors some time ago secured
shareholders' consent to increase nominal
capital to £75,000. For a start 20,000
new £1 shares are to be issued, but £lO,OOO
of reserves is to be distributed as a bonus
which will be used to make this issue paid
to 10s. before calling upon the shareholders
to put up any cash.
This co. lias not expanded nearly so rapidly
as many others in the same business; still
by restricting divs. to 8 p.e. it has been got
into a fairly comfortable position:—

has been a visible improvement of £2764.


The advantage of having battery charging current
on tap in the home garage is now within the reach
of every motorist. The G.li. Mercury Arc Batten-
Charger makes any ordinary lighting circuit a source
of energy for starting, lighting, and ignition bat-
teries. Its cost is a mere trifle compared with the
convenience and economy of home charging. An
overnight boosting charge every few weeks will not
only increase the efficiency of a batterv, but will
also lengthen the life of the plates. 'You should

During its 41 years this Maoriland drug
co. has developed a very extensive business,
but its expansion during the past 10 years
has been as great as in the previous 30.
l*riQr to 1911 paid capital had long been
around £200,000. Since then a further
£187,705 has been got in from shareholders,
and with the assistance of these new funds
and the surplus profits kept in the business
the P. and L. figures have galloped ahead
in this way :
Gross Profits. Expenses.
1910 .. .. £63,034 £36,426
1916 .. .. 67,094 43,635
1916 .. .. 74,934 50,204
1917 .. .. 93,363 67,777
1918 .. .. 107,237 77,571
1919 .. .. 120,532 87,011
1920 . . .. 139,909 100,098
Gross profits have thus doubled in five years.
Quite likely the co. has done better dur.ng
recent years than its figures have admitted,
for, having been caught napping in the long-
ago with over-valued stocks, the management
has lately taken no risks with its expensive
purchases, and has provided a substantial
reserve to meet any slump. Besides clipping
something from gross profits for this pur-
pose, cuts are also made for depreciation of
plant and buildings. No hint is given of
the extent of these allowances. However,
the co. did so very well last year that net
profits were ample to provide 10 p.c. on a
much-enlarged capital and then leave a sub-
stantial surplus for reserves. A considerable
amount of the new capital got in is being
put into chemical fertiliser works, an enter-
prise which the management hopes will begin
to earn its bit towards the end of the cur-
rent financial year. Some of the new funds
had not been called for at the balance, and
had been put out within easy reach to earn
something until required. Hence the big
expansion of the “Cash, etc.,” item in the
following comparison :
1910. 1914. 1919. 1920.
Capital .. £200,000 £263,656 £299,925 £367,140
Liabilities . . 59,442 54,082 84,692 76,650

Cash, etc. .. 4,373 22,120 71,843 133,976
Since 1910 £167,140 of new capital has been
got in and £20,625 by way of share pre-
miums. Liabilities have meantime grown
by £17,208. Over the same period the book
value of stock has expanded £39,252. _ fac-
tories now stand in the books at £36,921
more, book debts are £51,770 more, and
cash and investments have grown by
£129,603; the book value of all assets
having thus advanced well over a quarter-
million. Deducting tlie additional share capi-
tal and other money put into the business,
the balance-sheets show that the co.’s posi-
tion as at January 31 last had been improved
by over £52,000 in 10 years. Dividends over
the same period averaged almost 74 p.c. p.a.

Ivabell Mockbell, who has for years been
extending a coffee connection in Sydney and
has developed a roll-and-coffee quick-lunch
business, is passing the thing over to a co.
Mockbell’s, Ltd., is to have a capital of
£20,000, half offered for subscription. The
vendor takes the remaining 10.000 fully-paids
and £5OOO cash. This £15,000 is being paid
for the following assets: plant and furni-
ture, £8356; stock (landed cost), £3900;
leases and goodwill, £2744. The present
value of the six leases is not given; but
the vendor states that for one alone he has
been offered a thousand. Average net pro-
fits for the past three years are eiven as
£2057, the 1919 profits being £2805. No
doubt H.C.L. helped recent figures; but if
anything like this can be maintained with
the assistance of the additional £5OOO which
will be put into the business if the issue
is fully subscribed, 10 p.c. on the £20,000
of capital would be easy; and for the first
four years the public’s shares are to have
alO p.c. preference. With the £5OOO of cash
available, the co. intends to open in Mel-
bourne.
A £50,000 co. has been formed in Hobart
to set up a sewing-machine factory. Henry
(Jam) Jones and VV. 51. Williams, M.L.C.,
are prominent in the venture, and the man
behind the treadle is G. T. Wilson, whose
Melbourne plant is to be acquired by the co-
for 5000 fully paids, £2500 cash and £5OOO
worth of fuliy-paids ‘’on certain conditions
being fulfilled.” Wilson told the inaugural
meeting that sewing-machines now selling for
£lO could be made locally for less than £5.
It was also stated that the Commonwealth’s
consumption of sewing-machines is 50,000 a
year.

“Hustler”: The troubles of the Emu Bay
Railway (Tas.) will be added to next year
when the Waratah-Wynyard main road will
be completed, thus permitting motor-traffic
to compete. Several motor cos. are already
weighing the prospects, and one proposes to
establish a service from Waratah to the
coast (2i hours) to connect with the mid-
day train to Launceston’. As now run, the
privately-owned railway necessitates an
over-night stay at Burnie, but the motor-
service will make it possible to get to Laun-
ceston and back (IUU miles) in two days
less than at present. The motor cos. fur-
ther reckon that they will be able to carry
passengers for not more than the present
combined rail and hotel costs. Considerable
goods traffic is also likely to take to the
roads. Waratah, which has long been dis-
satisfied with the wretched rail service
and the heavy charges, will in particular
welcome the competition.

The hunt for oil in the Commonwealth is
livening up again. The Federal Govern-
ment’s expensive and unsatisfactory proceed-
ings in Papua are to come to a close, and
the Anglo-Persian Co. (which is largely
the British Government) will attend to the
search for gushers there. The Common-
wealth Government has decided to back the
enterprise up to £50,000. There is also a
likelihood that the reported find's neo,. (Je.
ton, Penrith and Richmond (N.S.W.) will
also have the attention of me -uigio-i ers.un
Co.’s experts, and N.S.W. Premier John
Storey has promised to co-operate in any
attempt to locate oil in payable quantities.
The Anglo-Persian crowd is also reported to
have decided to have a look over the Latrobe
(Tas.) shale-oil deposits. Meantime, a new
little co. of 50 £lO shares, the West Aus-
tralian Oil Prospecting Co., is being formed
to send a party from Wyndham, on the far
nor’-west coast, into the Northern Terri-
tory to try to locate a “reported find of
oil discovered by blacks.” They are a plucky
crowd who would go oil-hunting on infor-
mation of that sort.

“G. Arden Hill”: N. S. Wales colliery
managers have been having a gala time at
the Coal Commission lately. According to
their observations coal-miners are fair devils.
They refuse to sweat at their work; they
come out of the pit as clean as they went in;
they demand compensation for working defi-
cient places when it is they who are defi-
cient ; they are afraid to have their places
tested by competent men; they refuse to
take the advice of officials as to how they
should work the seam; they stop the pits
on the least provocation; they spend their
leisure in shying stones at empty houses and
otherwise damaging the cos.’ property and so
forth. If may be said at once that the con-
tract system under which the men work at
present is a solid safeguard against loafing
or malingering, inasmuch as it encourages
rivalry among the men. They do their best
to go one better than the other fellow. If
not, why do the cos. kick up such a hubbub
wffien it is proposed to abolish the system?
One manager stated that his pit had been
laid idle five days because of a dispute re
the allocation of working-places for old men
and the payment to them of the minimum
of 16s. 3d. per shift. If he paid this amount,
he said, it would mean the raising of the
standard throughout the pit. Well, these
old men are entitled to this minimum
by the award, and morally they are
more entitled to preferential treatment
and full wages than the younger workers,
because it was they who pioneered
the industry in the early days by work-
ing underground 12 hours daily. The hew-
ing rate was small in those days and trade
intermittent, and these old warriors had a
hard row to hoe in rearing their families.
They are certainly entitled to some con-
sideration now that the industry is buoyant.
But the talk about infirmity doesn’t ring
true. If a man is nimble enough to walk
two or three miles up the mountain-slopes
of Illawarra, and then two or three miles
underground in a stooped position and bur-
dened with picks, drills, tucker-tin, water-
bottle, explosives, etc., he is vigorous enough
to get coal. It is l’eally hard work to get
to work in some of the N.S.W. South Coast
mines.
From a Bulletin man: —
I visited lit. Monger (W.A.) ior a second time
the other day, but except tor a little digging here
end there and the adding of a square mhe or so to
the area pegged, the field bad changed little since
I raw it in February. Of the scores and scores of
persons and half-dozen or more cos. holding leases,
few have done more than pick a bit of the surface,
and on most of the holdings nothing appears to have
been done at all. The best of the shows seem to be
the Mt. Monger Proprietary on the north and the
Lass o’ Gowrie on the south end of the field. Both,
however, are still only prospects, and their chances
of permanency are hotly disputed. The field has
many experts puzzled. The fact remains that there
is gold showing in several shows, and pending
development it is impossible to say what is going
to happen. One thing is apparent, though: of the
hundred or more leases pegged on the field only a
small percentage have any prospects.
* ■* * *
Westralian Mines Minister Scaddan had
a look at Mt. Monger recently, and though
he admitted that "developments are insuin-
cient to permit one to express a definite
opinion,” he proceeded to play into the hands
of boomsters Dy describing tne field as "the
best thing he had seen outside Ivalgoorlie.”
He talked, too, of loaming as a “new method
of prospecting.” But there is nothing new
about loaming; prospectors employed the
method in Y'ictoria 40 years ago, and during
the past decade or two it has proved won-
derfully successful on Westralian goldfields
where the ore deposits are deep-seated and
do not outcrop.
* * * *
Several Westralian mines are on the verge
of shutting down for want of labor. There
is a great scarcity of men on all fields, and
the pinch is being felt much more at Ival-
goorlie than elsewhere. Scores of meu are
leaving the deep workings to grub about
the surface or sink prospecting shafts on
Hampton Plains and other rejuvenated fields.
Hobart building employees are not bother-
ing about a demand for a shorter working
week :, they find their weeks too short
already.. This is due to a scarcity of
cement. Although the building trade in
Hobart is having the greatest boom in its
history, brickies, laborers and so on are
working only about half-time. Yet in
several parts of Tasmania there are huge
deposits of limestone which have been
tested, and the tests show that the best
cement could be produced there. Works
Minister Hayes says that, if Private Enter-
prise (which, as a rule, doesn’t go more than
about 15dwt. of real enterprise to the ton)
doesn’t get to work on the manufacture of
cement locally, the Government will have to,
not only to assist in overcoming the house
famine, but also to ensure supplies for the
big hydro-electric works which are about to
be begun.

Imoortant developments are proposed on
the Heemskirk (Tas.) iron deposits by the
C. and G. Hoskins Co., of Lithgow
(N.S.W.). Geologist Reid estimates
3.500,000 tons of magnetite in sight that will
grade 65 to 70 p.c. iron. It is proposed to
open the deposits on a fairly large scale,
shipping the ore to N. S. Wales for smelt-
ing. In all probability a branch line will be
run from the Eden siding on the Government
line to Strahan, about 13 miles. Zeehan-
ites would prefer to see the Comstock 2ft.
tramway extended to this iron proposition and
the Federation tin-mine, so that the trade
would flow through the silver city, but the
standard gauge from Eden easily makes
that the best business proposition.

Mt. Lyell is now opening the No. 6 ore
bench in the open-cut of the Lyell Comstock
mine at a depth of 230 ft. This ore and
a small tonnage of low-grade stuff from the
North Mt. Lyell provide the feed for
the flotation-plant. Tas. Government
geologist Hills is now investigating the
Lyell district ore deposits, and expects to
be through with the task in about six
months.
The Speck’s new Governor should be
popular in the mining districts. He was
chasing wolfram on the shoulders of Ben
Lomond 25 years ago. It will probably
interest him to know that his old mine, the
Storey’s Creek of to-day, is said to have
distributed £40,000 among its five owners
last year.

The Electrolytic Zinc Co. is getting ready
to handle big traffic at its Risdon (Tas.i
zinc works. Plans have been approved for
a wharf SOO feet long and with 48 feet
of water alongside. As there is 60 or 70
feet of water from the mouth of the Der-
went right up to Risdon, anything afloat
will be able to go up to the wharf, and
deep-sea vessels will be able to load zinc
and other stuff direct from the works.

From Darwin: The previously-reported
rich tin find, about 35 miles from Pine Creek,
which aroused great excitement in the Ter-
ritory and caused practically everyone to
leave the. Creek and surrounding stations, is
not nearly so good as it was at first reported
to be. Values and quantities have faded
away on investigation; nevertheless, it does
seem lively that something worth while has
been unearthed.

Oil-production in the New Plymouth dis-
trict (M.L.) is not very profitable, so Tar-
anaki Oil Wells is going out of business.
The country in that volcanic belt is too
disturbed to promise financial success.
Kecent work on the titaniferous iron
sands of new Plymouth (M.L.) suggests that
profit might be made by briquetting and
using a liot-blast furnace. These sands
extend for 300 miles along the coast, and
have a remarkably even iron content of 30
p.e. Sand dunes at New r Plymouth run as
high as 00 p.c. iron and 15 p.c. titanium,
and as geologists aver the quantity of sand
is yearly being increased, the proposition
contains immense possibilities. Arrange-
ments have been completed with an English
co. for the establishment of an electrical
furnace at Parapara, another Maoriland
iron deposit. The ore available is large, and
is reported to average 73 p.c. iron oxide.

“Dido”: The story about Holroyd who
“passed” the .soup recalls one of Madden.
While on circuit he went into a prosperous-
looking barbery. He sat a moment looking
at the paper: then, just when an onerative
had crooked a
finger a t h i m.
his friend was
surprised t o
note that the
Chief arose and
fl ed. Outside,
“What is the
matter —■ for-
g e t some-
thing!” asked
the frie n d.
“Oh, no,” re-
plied John, “I
remember very
well. But if
you’d hear d
what that
barber said to
me when I sen-
tenced him to
five years in
Ballarat you
wouldn’t be sur-
prised a t m y
trying another
establishment.”
W.J. SOW DEN,
of the Adelaide
Register, who
had a 62nd
birthday this
week.
From a Federal smoke-room: —
A Tait concert team could be recruited from
the Labor party alone. Makin, who unseated Archi-
bald for Hindmarsh (S.A.), has a pleasing warble;
and we could overcome part of the sugar shortage
with Cunningham’s syrupy ballads. Cunningham’s
voice is often heard in the lobbies, but the big
fellow is restful compared with Moses Gabb. Gabb’s
voice was trained on hymn tunes, but he can give
a secular song of pathos that will start a profiteer
hunting for liis hanky. Jim Page used to roar in
the fullness of a contented heart, but now he can
only spare the breath for a whistle that sometimes
gets stranded among the top notes. The best enter-
tainer either the House or the Labor party ever
had was the lately-sacked Finlayson. Looking at
Finlayson’s dour countenance, one would never
realise that he could deliver a cheerful Lauder ditty
with the laughter and mellow music of the com-
edian himseli.
In its 54 years the N. S. Wales Leg.
Assembly has had 15 Speakers—nine laymen
and six lawyers. The first four were
laymen, the last three lawyers. William
McCourt, a printer, had the longest reign—
-10 years three months.
According to the Rev. Ninian Melville,
who was Archie Peake’s friend and spiritual
pastor, the late S. Aus. Premier thrice
declined a knighthood.
Obit, William Crane, Australia's G.O.M.
of chess, aged 69. He won the champion-
ship in 1887 from representatives of all the
States and Maoriland, and was unbeatable
for many years, until Jacobson defeated him.
In his younger days he was a notable
cricketer; and he likewise was an expert
judge of dogs and poultry. He earned his
crust on the literary staff of the S. M.
Herald, which he served for 36 years.
Through the death of Frank Cullen The
Bulletin last week lost the best foreman-
printer in Australia. He came across from
the Government Printing Office just upon
40 years ago, and to him, especially in the
early days of “process” illustration. The
Bulletin was largely indebted for the high
quality of its work. To his technical skill
was added a cheerful disposition which was
a great aid in .smoothing out whatever dif-
ficulties arose in his department. He was
66 at the end.
John Estell, Minister for Works in the
Ma State’s new Labor
Cabinet, is the oldest
man of the crowd in
point of years and
Parliamentary ser-
vice. Elected in 1901,
after two years’ mem-
bership of the Upper
House, the northern
miners have seen to it
that he has had a suc-
cession of easy wins
ever since. Premier
John Storey was
elected at the same
time, but at the 1904
elections he was
dropped for three
years. Estell had a
period as Minister for
Labor in the Labor
Government that
broke on the conscrip-
tion rock. Having
spent his best years in
rough company he de-
veloped such an elo-
que n 11 y expressive
way of calling a spade
a shovel that
the Governor almost allowed him to swear
himself in as Minister.
Tom Burgan, just dead at 83, was one of
Adelaide’s most prominent educationists in
his day. All his life was given to school-
mastering. except for the inevitable trip to
the Victorian gold rush in the eighteen-
fifties and a prospecting trip in the N.T.
later. He carried on with such success a
school founded by his father that he was
made inspector of South Aus. State schools.
His best day came in 1896, when the im-
mensely-efficient Hartley was killed in a
bicycle "accident, and three men were appointed
to do his work as head of the Education
Department. Burgan was one of the three.
Of course there is no significance about
it; but I. A, Bernstein, the new chief Rabbi
at Adelaide (in succession to the patriarch
Boas), was educated at a Scotch College.
He was born in Ballarat, trained in Victoria,
and is the first Australian-born Rabbi to
become “first minister” of an Australia capi-
tal-city synagogue.
Alexander Perceval Matheson (and don’t
forget the second e in Perceval), a former
Westralian Senator, became a baronet the
other day, succeeding his half-brother, the
second baronet, who didn’t marry till he
was just on 60 and left no child. The head
of the Matheson elan had to scratch for it
for many years, but things looked up about
a hundred years ago, and the estate is
pretty well gilded now.
Died, very suddenly, on April 23, one de
Brandt, of S’Africa, who was stranded in
Melbourne by the war. It was his father
who made great sacrifices in Vienna to
establish Socialism, and he was one of its
earliest spokesmen there 35 years ago. He
spent nearly all of a great fortune in estab-
lishing newspapers and forming parties, but
he saw little results for his money. The
son married a concert-singer, who may now
let Australians hear her voice.
Time is working great changes in Chief
Justice Irvine. Seventeen years ago, as a
politician, he proposed to charge fees to
senior pupils in the Vic. State schools. At
the “commencement” ceremony last week he
chanced his constitutional position as Lieut.-
Gov. and advocated a free University.
They were everywhere—in France and
Palestine; signalling in Mesopotamia: in
Persia; on the Indian frontiers; at Mur-
mansk ; in the German African colonies;
giving a hand in S’America; assisting the
Serbians; helping the L T .S.A. to make up its
mind. And now Captain E. J. Head, of
Bombala (N.S.W.), has returned to Eng-
land from the job of being chief flying in-
structor with Denikin’s Russian forces.
“Bouragi”: Those people who have been
talking about putting Judge Murray, of
Papua, forcibly on board the next Sydney-
bound steamer are taking a ri k. Murray
is about seven feet high, mostly piano wire
and whipcord, and always fit. At Oxford
lie was unbeatable in the heavyweight box-
ing events against Cambridge, and is a cham-
pion fencer in addition. Altogether, I’d
rather take on Governor David on, of N. S.
Wales, in spite of his athletic feats as men-
tioned to the press by himself.
Price Weir, Colonel of the 10th and leader
of South Australians at the Landing, has
been appointed president of Adelaide A'.
Emma.
The Manufacturers’ Congress of Australia,
meeting in Adelaide, has appointed J. A.
Harper president of the Federal body.
Harper has been in Australia since 1875,
spending the first part of the time in Queens-
land and the latter half in Adelaide. He is
managing director of the National Clothing
Co.
Dr. Stanislaus Emil Antony Zichy Woin-
arski, dead at Wood’s Point (Vic.), had car-
SUITABLY RECEIVEIL
“The Labor Government would see that the Prince
of Wales was suitably received during his visit in
New South Wales.” —Premier John Storey.
“Glad to meet you, Teddy! Cumanava-
drink!”
ried his load for 03 years. A Melbourne
Grammar boy, he left there to take medicine
at the local Uni., and graduated in 1879-80.
Later he settled with an additional M.R.C.S.
(Eng.) and F.R.C.S. (Ireland) at Ballarat,
where he remained until seven years ago,
when ill-health compelled him to retire. The
Vic. Judge Woinarski is a younger brother.
To the white man who knows how to look
after himself Papua is quite a salubrious
country. Chief medical-officer Strong, after
a visit to England, is about to return to his
job at Port Moresby. His tropical record
is that he has never had to take to his bed
through sickness at any time during 16
years’ service.
Dr. E. E. Morris, who returned from
active service a few months ago to take
up his old job of head of the Mental Dis-
eases Hospital at New Norfolk (Tas.), has
been made Chief Health Officer of the Speck.
Since Dr. Park resigned, more than 15 months
ago, there has been an acting C.H.0., the
Government obligingly keeping the job open
till Morris could return from the war. No-
body growls about that except those doctors
who went to the trouble of forwarding appli-
cations, with testimonials, unaware that the
advt. was only a formality.
Hibbert Newton, Clerk of the Vic. Parlia-
ments, has just finished 40 years in the ser-
vice. He began in the Registrar-General’s
office, and after four years was transferred
to the Assembly staff. Climbing was slow
till the Federal Parliament raised another
ladder for some of those in front of him.
Then he reached the top rung. The Magni-
ficent McCall, who runs the Uppali House,
had a similar long wait till the Impossible
Jenkins was shunted. Newton got the han-
kering for the political atmosphere from his
dad, another Hibbert Newton, who was
P.M.G. in the Nicholson Ministry in 1860.
Two of the courteous Clerk’s sons were war-
surgeons.
Maxwell, M.H.R., explained the other day
how he missed making a fortune at Broken
Hill. He was boundary-riding on Mount
Gipps station, near the Hill; but, finding
the job too arduous,
he made for Mel-
bourne just before
the station-hands dis-
covered the Mint and
cut it up into syndi-
cate shares. As a
young briefless bar-
rister Maxwell,
accompanied by two
others, spent a holi-
day as an amateur
nigger-minstrel in the
country. After audit-
ing the accounts for
the tour they declared
a profit of 2s. 9d.
And just then they got
a claim for 2s. 9d. on
account of damage
done to a chair in the
course of a burlesque
political speech.
MeARTHUR, lately
lifted to the Bench of
the Supreme Court of
Vic .
Another record? Schoolmaster John
Waterman spent the whole of his pedagogic
career of over 40 years in Balmain (Syd-
ney) ; was never late for toil, and never lost
a day—even for a stop-work meeting. I’re-
mier John Storey is one of his former pupils.
“Albatross” sees a schoolmate off: —
My first acquaintance with that good fellow the
late Claude Marquet was at school in his (and my)
native town, Wallaroo (S.A.) ; and I still have a
water-color which he painted at the age of 14. It
is a good likeness of the old Black Diamond barque
Verulain. I won it as first prize in a model-yacht
race in the days when I was only playing at being
a shipmaster. Claude presented the first prize, and
as his boat ran second he received from me a box of
cheap paints as second prize, and seemed quite
pleased with it. Marquet started life as a comp,
on the Wallaroo Times, an ultra-respectable print
run by a lovable pair o’ Scawtch brithers, Andra
and Dawvid Taylor. Thence he drifted on to Adelaide
Lantern, vice another Wallarooite, Alf Levido, as
cartoonist. But, tiring of poor pay and having no
honor in his own country, he migrated to N.S.W.,
which has now claimed him for good.
Mrs. Scott Griffiths, the best womau-
debater for the Socialist party in Australia,
goes back to the U.S.A. next month. Born
in Texas in the early ’seventies, she is a
Scotch-French mixture, and wasn’t out of
her teens when she roamed over her State
talking politics, and especially prohibition
—“an early indiscretion,” she explains.
Then she read Law at Texas University,
became a law reporter, and started off on a
world tour to chase fame. She caught a
husband instead, in Fiji, in ’97, and, though
a tireless worker for her party, has had
time to have 10 children. She has been
writing “ever since she can remember,” con-
fesses that so far she hasn’t written any-
thing worth while, but hopes to yet. In
Brisbane, where she has lived for some time,
she pushes the Girls’ Labor Club, is a small,
spare bumi'e of energy, hasn’t enough
female vanity to fill a thimble, but is a
remarkable woman for many better reasons
than that.
There are several things to the credit of
Colonel J. 11. Bruclie, the new commandant
of N. S. Wales. He made his military start
as a full private in the senior cadets, and as
the son of a small tradesman at North Mel-
bourne he had a hard fight against social
influences.
Down in South Yarra, the first suburb
of Melbourne to be built, lives, in a little
shady street between the tramways and the
Yarra, a tall, quiet man whose name is
Horne, and who earns a living by buying
and selling house-property. He is Aus-
tralian-bred, but remembers his father long
ago hearing from “Home” that a cousin had
joined the Royal Artillery. Nearly 40 years
have rolled, and that cousin is now General
Lord Horne, who earned his title and a nice
little income in the Flanders fights.
“0.K.”: Dr. Billy Maloney has only to
wait and most of his “wild ideas” become so
tame that they are adopted into the family.
The initiative and referendum was one of
the children of the little doc. 25 years ago.
He proposed it to the Vic. State Parliament
in 1895. With the Women’s Suffrage motion
which he proposed in 1890, Maloney and his
seconder (Major Smith) were only IS years
ahead of the time. Victorian women got
the vote in 1908. And with his plea for the
legitimation of children not begotten under
the marriage law Maloney was only 13 years
before the event, for he introduced it to the
Vic. State Leg. Assembly in 1890, and had
the satisfaction of seeing a bill through the
Commonwealth Parliament in 1903.
THE WAR-WINNER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When war came up with awful eyes,
Big Mary Binge arose,
And drove Ben off to fierce emprise,
With bitter word and blows.
While Ben fought there in trenches to I,
His missus here arose to howl
Of Empire woes, and every roar
She knew must help to win the war.
She spent Ben’s hard-earned oof, and when
He’d done a doughty deed,
She swelled her bulk before all men,
And talked about “the breed.”
She said the end could not arrive
While one fell Hun was left alive.
“The whole foul brood,” she said, “must go,”
And swiped tlic air a fearful Mow.
When Ben came home his Mary grim
Took all the people’s cheers,
And in the car she smothered him.
These days he scarce appears—
She’s always standing just before,
Explaining how we won the war ;
Bill gained some fame, one of the best —
She wears his medals on her chest!

“Spare Corp.”: It -was the things that
didn’t happen when Mars was King that
were the most wonderful. A moment came
when it seemed that I would have to tackle
on my own a bunch of Huns who -were
looming out of the mist towards the shell-
hole where I was on O.P. in front of our
outpost. I was already fingering the bomb
with which I intended to commence the
tackling, when suddenly the Huns deflected
their course and left me alone. In the ner-
vous relaxation that followed I (I don’t know
why) unscrewed the base plug and got one of
the shocks of my life—the bomb upon which
I was relying to confuse a whole bunch of
Huns, if they came too near (it was not my
business to expose the location of the O.P.
if they didn’t), was not detonated! And
the other bombs on the post were duds also.
Directly relief came the matter was reported
and two dozen undetonated bombs were found
in our trench. As we relied upon stopping
a Hun rush with the Millses, we would have
been well and truly trapped if a solid attack
had been made —-as it was made the _ next
morning—especially as there w r as practically
no wire out, the position being a new one.
The death-trap bombs had been handed
over with the position when we took charge,
though of course our O.C. was responsible
for not examining them.
“0.L.”: The attitude of Melbourne Uni.
authorities towards the students continues
school ma’amish. At the annual commence-
ment. when mamma came to see her William
take his degree, she found herself shepherded
into a small pen at the rear of the hall, while
the principal seats were occupied by persons
having no personal interest in the proceed-
ings except as participators in a social
event. Undergrads., to the expressed disap-
pointment of C.J. Irvine, who presided, were
conspicuous by their absence. The Univer-
sity should be a popular institution ; but it
is not, the fact being largely due to the
insufferable self-complacency of the Biir
Hoods who run the show along the same old
narrow groove.
* # * #
“Nap”: The most extraordinary bit of
circumnavigation done by any bullet I ever
heard of occurred three weeks after the
Landing. My cobber Jennie, of South A us.,
was about to expend a round, when one
arrived from his right front. The visitor
passed through two fingers of the left hand
aud the furniture of the rifle. Then it car-
ried on, ploughing a shallow furrow through
the lower part of the palm, forearm, upper
arm (just above the elbow) and side (near
the lower rib). There it: exploded a clip
of ammunition in the pouch, which sideshow
Jennie described later as “like a. kick from
a vin blonk.” He was back again three
weeks later looking for Jaeko with the
dressing still on.
“Learned Junior”: The spectacle of Prime
Minister Hughes undergoing cross-exam ina-
tion with the tongue of woman-
barrister Joan Lazarus drew a
full house to the Second Civil
Court in Melbourne. Half of
Selborne Chambers looked in at
the performance, and standing-
room was in request. What
Hughes thought of it could only
be surmised. For most of the
time he was leaning forward in
the witness-box, his elbow on the
rail, and two long fingers support-
ing his chin. His attitude was
one of much gravity, tempered
with some surprise at the position
in which a man may find him-
self. To the young bewigged and
high-eomplexioned lady who asked
him whether he hadn’t “sup-
pressed” something or other in the
Ozanne case, he returned a medi-
tative “No” and a .shake of the
head that had more than a hint of
reproach about it. To most of
the other questions he said “I do
not know” or “I cannot remem-
ber.” Though the lady barrister
got little change, she was neither
embarrassed nor disconcerted.
Her high-pitched voice never
wavered. She did not so
much as adjust her wig, or
call for a glass of water, or
pat her back hair, or fumble
with the papers in front of her. The
junior Bar, while of course satisfied that
it could have done the job better, admitted
that it might have been done worse.
A medical contributor dashes our hopes of
a sprightly old age :
When a newspaper reporter who knows nothing
of the subject “writes up” a scientific discovery
Truth puts up the shutters and goes home. Take
the recent “thyroid” discoveries, for instance. The
important thing about them is that an American
chemist has succeeded in manufacturing synthetically
a substance which before was only available by
making an extract of an actual thyroid gland. The
thyroid gland secretes a substance which is poured
into the blood and helps the natural functions of the
body. The American has manufactured this sub-
stance from inorganic matter and called it thy-
roxin ; and a biologist has used this thyroxin to
make tadpoles into frogs in a shorter time than is
natural. No particulars are available as to how
long the “young old” frogs lived after their coming
of age, or if they enjoyed it ; but it is claimed that
thyroxin will make people live for ever, or some-
thing like that. Sheer nonsense, of course. This
is what really would happen. When a thyroid gland
is over-stimulated from any cause, it pours out an
extra amount of its secretion into the blood, and
the possessor of the gland suffers from an exophthal-
mic goitre, having swollen, protruding eyeballs,
tremulous hands, sweaty skin, and a heart beating
19 to - the dozen. This is exactly what would hap-
pen if a healthy person took too much thyroxin. He
THE NEW(DE) RICH.
would give himself a goitre. This is not a theoreti-
cal statement. There is plenty of evidence behind
it. In the disease called myxeedema the exact oppo-
site of exophthalmic goitre is the case. The thyroid
gland does not, through some cause or other, give
forth enough secretion, and the affected person be-
comes dull and languid, with dry skin and hair that
falls out. These cases are fed on thyroid extract
and their condition improves. If they are given too
much, however, they suffer from the toxic symptoms
of an exophthalmic goitre. Even more readily would
a normal person develop goitre if fed on thyroid
extract or thyroxin. If this substance is put on the
patent-medicine market, claiming to prolong life,
restore beauty and youth, etc., I can see the pro-
fession having the time of its life treating an epi-
demic of quack-made goitre.

“Cal”: “Dial Sight’s” shell-burst (B.
15/4/’2O), with 15 killed outright, was a
minor one. At El Arish a Hun laid an egg-
on a party of Gyppo laborers; 28 were killed
outright, one lived a few minutes, and a
stream of walking-wounded made towards the
dressing-station. That night Taubes raided
again and, though the only casualty was a
Gyppo who was smothered when his dug-
out. in a sandhill, caved in, the frayed nerves
of the Gyppos were not equal to any further
shocks, and when dawn broke they were
reported 10 miles back and making for the
Canal and a quiet life. The desert railway
was held up for a fortnight unr,il fresh
gangs were drafted from Egypt, and even
then our ’planes kept up a constant patrol
to inspire confidence. (We hadn’t any con-
fidence in them at that time, but the Gyppos,
knowing nothing, bad.) That bomb had
more than a shambles to its credit.

The prevalent profiteering habit or disease
or crime has appeared in a new form in Mel-
bourne. A common or vociferous milk-oh,
being sent out daily with 212 quarts to
deliver, manipulated the measure so deftly
that by serving each customer short he
“saved” 50 quarts which he sold to another
dairyman. Before handing him “three
months, sentence suspended during good
behavior,” the Court asked if the man had
been dismissed. It was assured that he
was still in charge of his round, the other 50
or 60 employees having threatened to strike
if he were not reinstated. There is a Milk
Carters’ Union in Melbourne, and it would
be as well if it did something sudden; because
if the strike weapon is to be used to back up
and shield the robbery of citizens and the
starvation of infants, it won’t be long before
strikes are made criminal.
“Tom W.”: The talk of big bags by one
shell recalls the bad luck of the 14th Bat-
talion at Allonville, the home of the Three
Star Hennesseys. This was reckoned a
pretty safe possie, so scattering precautions
were not adopted, two companies being
billeted together in a big granary. Date
one night the Hun got to work with a new
h.-v. gun supposed to be a captured British
6in. Two successive shots obtained direct
hits on the granary. The 14th marched into
the line next night 130 men short. It had
spent the morning burying 30 of its cobbers
and patching up another hundred, 12 of
whom never saw Aussie again.

“Dolphin”: This isn’t the first time a
British prince has been to Honolulu; the
last time the voyage was made from Sydney.
It came about this way. When, in 1814, a
British man-of-war called the Cherub blew
into Hawaii- —or the Sandwich Islands, as
they were called then —King Tamehameha
I. asked if he could not have one of the
American vessels which the Cherub had
made prize. Captain Tucker was sending his
prizes to Valparaiso, and he reported the
King’s desire when he reached Portsmouth. So
Governor Macquarie was asked if he could
turn out a schooner at Sydney and send her
up to Hawaii. Macquarie, writing on March
18, 1816, said that he would get on the job
as soon as the Government brig, then on
the slips (the Harriet), was launched, and
would send the .schooner up to Hawaii as
soon as she was ready. The schooner, Prince
Regent, of 40 tons, was launched at Sydney
on April 7, 1819, and sailed from Port Jack-
son in company with the Mermaid, and in
charge of Captain J. R. Kent, on October
16, 1821. Tamehameha I. was dead by that
time, but his son, of the same name, re-
ceived the schooner all right, and in his
thankfulness was moved to remark in a
letter that he placed all his islands under
the protection of his Britannic Majesty.
According Turnbull, the Hawaiians made
voyages in their locally-built craft as far as
the coast of California. He speculates,
strange as it seems now, on the chances of
their becoming the chief sea-power in the
Pacific. It seemed in those days a lot more
likely that they would annex California
than that California would ever annex them.
For long after that a big proportion of the
South Sea whalers had Hawaiians in their
METEOROLOGICAL.
“Darling, you alone reign in my heart! With
you by my side I could weather any
storm. You are the sunshine of my ”

report ?”
crews, and they made very fine boatmen.
There were Hawaiians even amongst the
sealers in Bass Straits and in the bay
whaling camps on the east coast of the
Speck. One of them, Mammoa, was killed
by the Oyster Bay abos. at Grindstone Bay
in 1824.

Augustus was a naval man —his second name was
Brown.
He longed to meet a girl of ample means and
settle down.
Dot was a moneyed maiden who aspired to he

Of one who wore gold epaulettes and led a sailor’s

The dear old sentimental Herald brought to Dot’s

Lieutenant Brown, R.N. The lady found him
“simply sweet.”
All Edgeclift' praised his uniform. His dancing was
admired
By folks on Bellevue Hill itself! What more could

“Quite nice,” he heard, “but re/./ No! No!
Emphatically not!”
It was the Fleet Commander’s voice. His words
referred to Dot.
Augustus went on dec!;, by overwhelming sorrow

“Our dream must end,” he sighfd, “my boyish

That very night Dot wrote to him, in accents of
disdain:
“You are not ref.,’ her letter ran. “Don’t call

A note from Brown crossed tiers that night in
which he pointed out
That they must part. “You know,” he wrote, “the

“Teller” on the transfer of money:—
Non-negotiable cheques have been under discussion
before the Chief Justice in Sydney; and ’s Honor
has been making a valiant effort to arrive at the
practice with a view, probably, to see if he could
square the law with it. It is agreed among the big
banks, whatever may be the law on the subject, that
a bank should be very careful about cashing a cheque
lor Smith if it has been drawn by Brown and made
payable to the order of Jones, even though Jones’s
name is on the back of it. In most banks such a
cheque has to go to the accountant, who will Want to
have Jones’s endorsement verified and to know how
Smith comes to have the paper in his possession.
Smith might have stolen it; the endorsement may

“ Girlie , you ARE wearing your gown low."
"Yes, dear, it’s the height of fashion."
be a forgery. Much faith is put in the mere making
of a cheque payable to order. Banks know that,
and therefore struggle to protect themselves (they
being liable if they are negligent) and their cus-
tomers. What, then, can be done for safety suppose
you want to send a cheque to Smith, of Tibooburra?
The best plan, if you are in the habit of sending
remittances to Smith, is to find out his bank. Say
it is the A.B.C. Then you make the cheque payable
to the Australian Bank of Commerce, Tibooburra,
and either cross it “Credit account William Smith”
or draw it “Australian Bank of Commerce for credit
of Wm. Smith.” The man who can make much dis-
honest use of that cheque if it falls into his hands
en route almost deserves the money.
POSITION VACANT.

“Dusty Folio”: What astonishing dis-
coveries the railway-carriage cleaner makes !
One lately found a bundle of old V.D.L.
documents in a train that had been running
between Melbourne and Albury; and, handed
to me for an opinion, they lifted me back
in 10 minutes into the heart of “the sys-
tem.” Here, for instance, is a receipt for
40s. given by Steven Appleton who had got
the money for helping to run
down Martin Cash, the escaped-
convict bushranger. But a
grimmer document is the record
of William Vickers, who was
tried at Chester in 1842 for
stealing a coat, and arrived at
Hobart Town in 1843. In
September, 1845. he tried to ab-
scond, and was given six months’
hard labor'; and from then on
lie was up against it hard. By
1850 he had qualified for 12
months in chains at Port
Arthur, and before that was
over he had been given four
months’ solitary in the “new
cells” (presumably those of the
Cascades) for being absent from
work without leave. By this
time he seems to have been
quite mad; on October 10,
1850, he was awarded 14 days
in the cells for tearing his
trousers, and on November 18
of the same year two months
for tearing up his shirt. So
it went on for years, irons and
lashes, lashes and irons, until
in 1852 he got 14 days' cells for
the crime of sleeping in church.
A couple of times this year he
contrived to get hold of tobacco ;
the first time he was let off
with 50 lashes and six days in
the cells, but the second cost
three months’ cells. After that
there was four months’ more
cells, and then silence. There
is a companion piece to this giving the
record of a woman convict, a “plain cook
and housemaid,” transported from Liverpool
to Hobart Town in 1832 for stealing 16
sovereigns; and she had nearly as much
of Hell as Vickers had.

The chief pride and joy of a little Tassy
town, as presented on local postcards, is a
new wooden Methodist church with emblem-
atic windows. They are shaped like key-
holes. Even the doorways follow that
pattern. So the edifice looks like a sermon
on the text: “Thou God seest me.”

he lobbed in a V.A.D. Hospital at
VVnnbledon. Did Bluey roar? Not on your
lile. He found everything good-o—nurses,
tucker and all—and promptly dug-in. Three
months later he confided he was doing a little
lead-swinging—that the “joint” was too
good to leave. He even
refused the offer of a
couple of Brads. “I’m
set,” he said, “making
five and six dieeners n

1844, which discusses,

“Sehoolma’am”: I had been telling my
class that human hair often grows after its
owner’s de'ath, and that in cases where
coffins had been opened some time after
burial the corpse had been found to have
grown a prolific crop. The youngsters, as
usual, were invited to comment on the les-
son, and after a few commonplace remarks
from others Bob piped up: “Oh, Miss D ,

can have been in as many alarms and excursions as
the Mobile Artillery Brigade I commanded for 34
years, or they wouldn’t argue about people’s religious
beliefs in connection with the A.I.F. The
Jews didn’t start that argument. (2) The
statement made by “Michael” anent the Jew-
ish battalion is wrong. I declined considera-
tion for a similar appointment. Lieut.-Col.
Margolin, D. 5.0., a Westralian Jew in the A.1.F.,
commanded an East End battalion in Palestine. Pat-
terson was chosen in preference to the Chosen be-
cause of his special knowledge of country and lan-
guage. (3) The East End uneducated Jews who tried
to dodge conscription were at least no worse than
the Australians who stayed at home and voted
against conscription. (4) lam an Australian of the

People in that area only wanted to know if a man

his affair and had no bearing on his usefulness. If
everyone acted that way here a lot of very good
people would be less excited and more friendly, to
everyone’s advantage.

“The Oldest Inhabitant” revels: —
The Old White Hart, at the top of Big Bourke-
street, which it is said a syndicate hopes to amalga-
mate with the neighboring Grand, is perhaps the most
historic shingle in Melbourne, Scott’s and Menzies’
not excepted. At the fifth Melbourne land sale,
held in Sydney on April 11, 1839, ex-Army offi-
cer P. L. Campbell, Police Magistrate at Parra-
matta and later at Maitland, bought the corner,
with other lots, for about half a guinea a foot.
The old house, when I first dropped in 63 years ago,
was a small, white-washed pub, with shop-windowed
bar. The door was on the angle, over which was
a small iron balcony, from which many an old-time
politician harangued the people. The license dated
from the ’forties; the house was recognised as “the
first and last”—the first that travellers from the
Plenty met on reaching town and the last on the
homeward trip. I think Henry Lineham was the
earliest licensee. On New Year’s Day, 1850—70
years ago—sports were held in the vacant ground
opposite, now occupied by the Houses of Parliament;
there were foot-races, pig racing, greasy pole, quoits
and skittles, and “the old English game of football.”
When Separation came, and Port Phillip made way
for Victoria, the old inn exhibited a transparency of
her Majesty, on the throne, assenting to the Separa-
tion Act. A Mr. Coleman succeeded Lineham, and
then came the most noted of the licensees, th<
Flanners. On the opposite corner was the Salic
de Valentino, the corner later occupied by the
political tailor, “Mint Sauce’’ Jones. Adjoining the
old White Hart, and presently absorbed in the new
house, was the book store of H. T. Dwight, who
had a stock of 30,000 second-hand volun.es, which
took three weeks to sell by auction after his death.
A very big bar trade was done in the old inn on a
night in August, 1860. The usual democratic meet-
ing had been held in the Eastern Market. A politi-
cal crisis was on and the meeting in a body proceeded
to Parliament House and threatened to break things.
Dr. Eades, the Mayor, read the Riot Act —anjl
promptly a riot ensued. The police took part in
the mclfe, and there was a great rush to the White
Hart. I was of the number. Not much blood
was shed, but next day an Act was passed through
all stages in both Houses prohibiting political meet-
ings within a radius of a quarter of a mile of
Parliament House. This covered the Eastern or
Paddy’s Market, and of course the White Hart
premises.

“Peter” : I can remember barrister George
Maxwell, as a political aspirant
more than 25 years ago striding in to request
dad’s vote. Dad refused, like Crom-
well repelling the crown, and I felt that his
attitude demanded explanation. “Vote
for him!” roared dad when I asked for par-
ticulars. “Why, he’s mixed up with mur-
derers and thieves.” “But he only defends
them in the courts,” I said. “Yes,” came
triumphantly from the empurpled counten-
ance, “and he hasn’t got a word for them
outside. A man who hasn’t got the courage
of his convictions doesn’t get a vote from
me!”

looking forward to the time when one of
his Johns will win a world’s championship.
Meanwhile J. Hop, having cultivated the
graces, will be in a position to deal with
the local malefactor who betrays a desire
to mix it after falling into the hands of
the police. Furthermore, the intended
reforms will greatly facilitate the chances
the Johns have of wrapping their clutches
about the nimble thief. In despair of run-
ning a man down, the police now resort to
the practice of shooting him down, a wholl'
unsatisfactory process that tends to abolish
the wholesome custom of trial before execu-
tion. The Vic. police at present are ill-
conditioned, and need a severe course of nth-

THE PERILS OF THE PRINCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“The knowledge that Prince Edward has made a
point of dancing with working-class girls as well
as with the daughters of the rich and great will
ensure keen competition for his Highness’s favor
on the floors of Melbourne ballrooms.” —Melbourne
paper.
It was a spacious hall, and gay with bloom and
many lights,
And maidens sweet and matrons suave in meteoric
flights
Across the polished floor were shot in mazes of the
dance,
/ind every woman strove to catch the Prince’s
lightest glance.
The girls were ranged along the walls in dazzling
garments clad,
Their hair in wondrous fashions wreathed ; expectant-
eyed and glad
They followed every move he made, and trembled
when it seemed
That for a tick the Royal orb upon their beauty
beamed.
They wore strange jewels to enhance the wonder of
their dress;
Their diamonds were throwing out bright signals
of distress.
Their cheeks, more red than ever cheek of woman
was before,
Like flags flapped signs to Edward as he paced
the throbbing floor.
They wriggled in their seats; and fair, gesticulat-
ing hands
Wagged fans as ragged castaway on far unpeopled
sands
May wildly motion when he sees above the sealinc
dim
The shape of some rare vessel that salvation is
to him.
The hour grew late. A fever took possession of
their eyes.
’Twas something kin to blank despair. With low,
impassioned cries,
And rushing simultaneous, they fell upon the Prince.
Apart from small mementoes nought’s been seen of
Edward since.

“Wop ’: T nm one of a party of returned
optimists engaged prospecting certain allotted areas
in the N. Territory. On failing to discover a for-
tune on the Alligator and Katherine river areas we
were ordered south to the Fitzmaurice, and had very
little time in which to effect the move before the
heavy rains were due. In order to assist in getting
our six months’ supplies landed on the scene and
under cover before the rain-merchant officially opened
the wet season and made tra.eiling impossible, we
decided on mustering a mob of bucks and gins for
packing purposes. Loading the abos. with from 50
to 80 pounds’ weight each, we completed 150 miles
of extremely rough going in less than three days.
During the last day of the stroll one of the gins
took advantage of the three hours’ rest at mid-day
- o become the mother of twins. The family selected
the stronger one, the other being knocked on the
head with a lump of granite, after which the mother
proceeded to dispose of the remains in a specially-
constructed crematorium, which, if unconventional,
was certainly of original and effective design. On
being informed of the facts, I opened court and
prepared to hand out justice in the most approved
style, until the accused met me with the following-
defence: “Me no plenty strong plielluh, no can
givem tucker two phellah piccaninny. More better
one phellah grow up b-i-g phellah than two phellah
grow up all same kangaroo-rat." These Northern
native women have children without any apparent in-
convenience or concern. The brunette just referred
to refused to remain behind when the mid-day rest
was concluded, and became highly vituperative when
I instructed another gin to relieve her of her 501 b.
load, which she insisted upon retaining, and carried
it into camp that night in addition to the picca-
ninny.

“A.W.D.”: “Senex” (B. 1 S/3 '2Ol men-
tions the phenomenon of springs breaking out after
considerable spells of dry weather. The occurrence
was noted all along the Barwon (N.S.W.) from above
Walgett to below Brewarrina, after more than a year's
drought, in 1903. 1, in common no doubt with other
leading scientists, was frequently asked for an
explanation. Here is mine. The shrinkage of the
soil, marked by extensive chasms, reduces the resist-
ance, and allows the water underneath to rise to
the surface. In every case coming under my own
observation, where tested, water was obtainable at
a reasonable depth, not usually greater than 120 ft.
“Billy B.”: Recent Abo. writers who
have been putting their affidavit to the statement
that Australian black children are as bright at
their school lessons as the white pfellers, ale
echoing the Sydney Gazette of April 17, 1819. In
reporting the annual schools’
(white and black) examina-
tion at Parramatta, which
was conducted simultaneously,
the Gazette stated that
“prizes were prepared for
distribution among such of
the children as should be
found to excel in the early
rudiments of education, moral
and religious, and it is not
less strange than pleasing to
remark, in answer to an
erroneous opinion which had
long prevailed with many,
viz., that the aborigines of
the country were insusceptible
of any mental improvement
which would qualify them for
the purposes of civilised asso-
ciation, that a black girl of
1 4 years of age, between three
and four years in the school,
bore away the second prize.”
There’s a legend that an abo.
lad was taken to England by
a well-ofT white man, edu-
cated at good schools and
passed the law r exams. With
the idea uppermost that he would be of great
value as a defender of the rights of his race he was
returned to Australia, and in six months he had
gone bush!

“Albatross”: During my stay in “German”
New Guinea many people wondered why I didn’t
contract malaria; and when I explained the reason
the}' would hardly believe me. I was convalescent
from rheumatic fever and was sharing a room in a
hotel with a Hun. One morning, as I reclined in a
chair, a green lizard blew in and stopped at my
feet, gazing up at me with beady, inquisitive eyes.
1 flung it a few dead flies from the window-sill, which
were gobbled up greedily and the lizard departed.
Next morning 1 was surprised to see the reptile
come in again, making unmistakable demands for
kaikai. This was the beginning of a fast friendship
which the lizard cemented by crawling up my leg
and into my hand. I called him Hindenburg out of
respect for my German room-mate. My reptile con-
temporary was intensely jealous of me, and would
spit venom at anyone who came near me. He was
invaluable as a watch-dog, and used to perch on mv
forehead at night, whilst I was asleep, keeping a
sharp look-out for insects. It was all over with
any mosquito, germ-carrying or not, that came
within hailing distance of me. Hindenburg was the
best preventive measure I ever adopted.

“Tultul”: It’s quite true that the Sepik
River(N.G.)savages barter painted human skulls. I have
been with two expeditions up the river, and I found
the natives eager to exchange a skull for a toma-
hawk. They were not keen to swap for anything
else. In 1916 an ordinance was passed prohibiting
the purchase of skulls, as, owing to the demand, our
enterprising cannibal relative was collecting the heads
of living natives to carry on with.
Billy T. : Raff, a sandy man of medium
height, with an expression of settled ferocity,
entered the little pub at Twoup just after the arrival
0‘ fhe midday train. He hurled his luggage into
a corner of the bar-parlor, scowled hideouslv at
Barney, and demanded a room for one night. There
was that about Mr. Raff which implied that if he
could not have the room he would not think twite
about slitting a throat or two. After he had had
his dinner, which he ate much as if it had been

that’s no good to me. Sure with about
ten pints I OWN the blanky country."
an enemy and he a bigoted South Sea cannibal, Raff
took out a murderous-looking revolver, and <om-
meneed cleaning it with his handkerchief. “You
have a feller named Colson livin’ in Twoup, haven’t
you?” he asked. Barney admitted it with some
reluctance, not caring to facilitate homicidal action.
Raff produced a huge clasp knife and felt its edge.
“Where’s he livin’?” he demanded. “The white
place near the gate-house,” Barney replied. “Bui
what’s he bin doin'?” “The white place near the
gate-house?” Raff repeated with grim significance.
“1 s'pose you happen to know there’s a tall fair
woman livin’ with him as Mrs. Colson?” Barney
nodded. “She is middlin’ tall and sorter fair,” he
admitted. Raff took up. his stick, an implement
like a nullah. “I’m goin’ to look Colson up,” he
said; “fellers like him has got to be taught what
it means takin’ away other men’s wives.” “Then
you’ll be stayin’ a fortni’t,” said Barney. “One
night 1” said Raff, and went off in the direction of
the gate-house. Barney snatched up his hat and.
made a beeline for the police-station. He had
some little difficulty in locating Constable Mooney,
and when he returned Raff was back from his bloody
work, and shut in his room. Barney knocked softly.
“I couldn’t get the police in time to stop you,” he
said in a tone of great commiseration, “but I have
the doctor. He is here,” “Bring him in,” said
Raff faintly. “And, landlord, I will be stayin’ a
month.” “I knew you would,” answered Barney.
I know Colson well. One time I had a little
trouble with him myself.”

“Xallah Dooh”: Have seen beri-beri near
Darwin. West from Rum Jungle some of the abos. had
got in the way of going to Bert Smitheram at
Muekinbar. His cure was sliced raw potatoes, washed
down with vinegar. A week generally put them on
the road to recovery. Christmas, 1915, was a bad
time on the Roper River, Mataranka way. Floods cut
off fresh supplies, and sufferers blamed the two-
years-old flour they had to use. They had little
else for a consul ruble time. Have seen beri-beri,
too, south of the Rankine. Lack of fresh vegetables
is blamed for it there. Certainly most sufferers
recover after a good go at green stuff.
“Jack Beer”: “Bouragi” (B. 11/12/H9 —
you’ve only just arrived at my outpost) has
•evidently moved in very low-class cannibalistic
circles, since he reports that saltiness is attributed
to the flesh of the white man. A dear old friend
of mine from the Baining District (New Britain),
who is now too dentally fragile to tackle anything
tougher than well-stewed young baby, assures me
there is no kaikai to surpass “missinairy”—
“Popey,” for choice! In the early days, he was
regretfully unable to deny, several juicy morsels
were eaten very soon after their arrival, and much
water was then required to stop the raging of
thirst. Later research showed that, after a few
months on a modified native diet, the white man’s
unpleasant saline qualities entirely disappeared, and
the season was well and truly declared open for
his special benefit. When you come to think of
it this explains a whole lot, doesn’t it?

“Cerboyrie : Disciples of Malthus could

chiefly between the

about. Consider this. Some years ago a Monaro
(N.S.W.) breaker, W. E. Smith, rode 100 roughs in
a day, and he mounted them without saddle or bridle.
This is authentic, man and money in case of a
wager to be found at the Swag and Saddle, Hawkes-

Bega, and the brumbies came from the vicinity of
the Snowy River, so they were no sloths. Met
Smith a few weeks ago. He hardly remembered

about, anyhow.” he drawled.

The purple-blooming pawpaw, yielding perfume in

Droops in the drowsy, murmuring - dark. A solitary

Peers through the leafy curtain where I wait my

Inhaling tropic incense from hibiscus-orchards far.
All the spicy air is smelling
Of a myriad budlets swelling,
And the night is filled with music where the bull-

For a draught of the elixir at Love’s fountain to be

Little one, my heart is burning
To express its utter yearning
While the peanut-bird entrances us with soul-
uplifting sound!
Come sit with me and sigh with me in a corner still

“S. Magnum”: “Jim Carew” (B. l/4/’2O)
slants to know a simple method of distinguishing,
without having recourse to chemicals, alluvial till
from “mineral” of kindred aspect. Tell him to pin
his faith to “streaks.” Best' results: are obtained
by drawing the mineral across a piece of unglazed
porcelain. A more primitive method is ,to scratch
the metal with a knife-blade and rub the resultant
powder on white paper. Characteristic streak-
optained by above methods: hematite, all varieties,"
blood-red; cinnabar, scarlet;' gold, vellow; copper
pyrites, greenish-black; antimony, lead-grey; molyb
denite, greenish-black. Tinstone is easily distin-
guished by its pale greyish-white appearance when
powdered. Wolfram gives a dark reddish-brown.
Iron ores - may sometimes be mistaken for tin, but
they always give a dark red to blackish streak.

Cyril Surcingle” : Another great horseman
was the late Peter Mclntyre, of Western Diftrict‘(Vic.).
When Peter was breaking for my grandfather he
used neither spurs, blows nor harsh language. Horses
instinctively trusted him. I have seen him put an
unbroken colt in a yard 90ft. square and catch,
saddle and bridle him without the slightest resent-
ment beyond the ordinary shiver of the colt at the
strange feeling of the harness. Peter would walk
slowly to the colt, talking softly and, upon reaching
it, fondle it with his hands, gradually increasing
the pressure on the animal’s back’ until ultimately he
was astride without saddle. It was a strange trick of
tate that ended Peter. He was riding over some
rough country when his horse put its foot in a
rabbit-hole, threw him and broke his neck.
REARED ON IT.
THE LADY: "Do you think it in quite healthy
to carry those pups about in the billy
you boil your tea in?”
THE WHALEK: “Bless me soul, lady, they’re
beggars for teal”
“A Jay Dee”: We reckoned that the mos-
quitoes about the camp were the limit, but the black
boy rectified our judgment when he returned from
his search for the horses. “Can’t find ’em, boss,’’
he explained; “can’t hear-em bells. Plurry ’skeeters
make ’em too much row-.’’
QUITE TRUE THIS TIME.
LOWLY: "So our friend Curly is retiring
from business!”
LOFTY : “Oh, Eve heard him say that before."
LOWLY: “Yes, but a Judge lias said it this
time.”
"Osprey”: My cannibal pal ruefully ate
a plate of rice and “bulumacow” (tinned m6at) and
discoursed: "Solomoni [Solomon Islands] boy he
top much fat sM~ti game uala [crocodile] ;
white man too much salt; Kong-kong
[Chinese] he bes’ one kaikai [food] —all-a
same nanny-goat. ’Spose I like eat-em
one fellow-man, I go walk about look out
alonga one fellow Kong-kong, bee-eoz he
nice one. Got-em plenty glavy.” My old
pal advises any person contemplating a
menu of European to roast or bake the
flesh. Boiling, he says, destroys the flavor.
Each joint should be carefully wrapped
in banana-leaves, placed on the heated
stones, trimmings of vegetables grouped
around, and the whole covered with more
leaves and hot stones until there is at
least a layer of six inches thick between
the meat and the air. The heat is all
retained inside the mound, and the flesh is
cooked in its natural juices. Three hours
is about the usual time a stone-oven takes
to cook the meal. Along the Owen Stanley
Range (Papua) and in' the great deltas of
the Gulf of Papua the eating of human
flesh was a favorite pastime, but now that
Guv’ment has decreed an. unending close
season for this form of game the art of
cannibalism is rapidly becoming forgotten.
The most relished cuts, according to my
authority, were the breasts of a young
gip I, a rib roast, a foot and the fore-arm.
The first-pamed tit-bit was often the
cause of the premature decease of some
guest who too forcibly urged his claim to
this coveted portion of tile roast. But
what epicure wouldn’t risk his life for the tickling
of his palate?
I 'U.P.”; In the Gascoyne country*of West-
ralia E. Byers lately secured 234 kangaroos in one
week off a square mile of country. In this district
squatters are not troubled with rabbits, but they
reckon the made-in-Australia animal compares
favorably with anything imported for getting rid
of young grass.
"Joe Collins”: "Bad Australian" (B.
8/4/’2O) is unduly optimistic in regard to the
ravages of wombats.
Although there is no
need for great alarm,
vet the ’bats greatly
minimise the effective-
ness of rabbit-proof
fences. He is .wrong,
too, when he says
that the raider is al-
ways located within a
few hundred yards of
the scene of his de-
structive operations.
Especially during
times of drought, they
wander for miles. Nor
can I agree with “Bad
Australian’s” method of
destruction. These
animals have the habit
of breaking through
a fence whenever they
come to it, even
though it be only a
few feet from where
they had previously
made an opening.
Therefore, while a pit
might account for one
or two who happen
to follow the pa i, a
dozen holes may be
made elsewhere. Bet-
ter to make sure of
the nuisances and
attack them in their
lairs. This is a
method I have used
and seen used by
neighbors with great
effect. Enlarge the
mouth of the burrow
so as to hold a fair
amount of wood; then
light a lire. Any rab-
bit-burrows or spider-
holes which are con-
nected with the main
burrow will now be
detected by the smoke
issuing out of them
and should he sealed
up. If one is missed
it will spoil the job.
When the fire Inis
burned down, push the
remains of it well
into the burrow, throw
in some more wood
and cover over with
a good layer of soil
well pressed down. The
first fire warms the
air in the burrow and prepares the way for the
second, which, after being sealed, burns up the
oxygen and the wombat suffocates.
* Mr * *
. “Nalla Dooh” f The natives of the Admi-
ralty Islands, Bismarck Archipelago and New Britain
boil young taro leaves and various other plants with
fish, rice or taro. One plant is very aromatic, and
only a few leaves are used. Most of these native
vegetables, cooked in European style, are palatable.
The tender.-shoots from the chilli-pepper bush boiled
jn cocoanut milk are OK. I have never seen the
home-made salt mentioned by “Talifarta,” but have
often seen the hill people of the Malala district,
Kaiser Wilhelmsland, trading taro, yams, sago and
sugar-cane for bamboos full of salt water. More
than once I have gone to the water-bamboos in a
hastily-deserted hill village and found salt water in
them. Some of these places were a long way inland,
and it must have been a wearisome trek for the
women carrying the full bamboos.
* * * *
“Jacket*’: Talking about the red spider’s
bite and the difficulty of counteracting it. I hap-
pened to squash a big tarantula while yarning to
an old Chinese fossicker. I asked him if he was
frightened of the hairy pests. “No,” he said, “me
no flightened spider. I tellee you how curem spi'
bite. Catchem flowl, stickem egg-hole on bite,
holdem on fi’ minutes. If spider led [red] on back
catchem ’nother flowl, holdem on fi’ more minutes.
That curem.” “What about the chook, Jimmy?”
I asked. “Huh, no matter flowl; he die sure.”
“G.” : Like Binghi, the New Guinea gentle-
man doesn’t burn himself and the scenery with Jap
matches. Sometimes in camp when there is nothing
much doing the N.G. boy's will make fire just to kill
time. These are : some of the methods I’ve seen:—
(1) A log of sandalwood Is split and a wedge in-
serted to keep the crack open. Some dried fungus
(cowdung will do) is sprinkled in the crack, which
is then sawn crossways rapidly with another piece
of sandalwood, the sawing piece being held so that
the palms are downward and outward. The fire is
usually produced when the cut is about one-eighth
of an inch deep. This method belongs to West
Bananaland.
(2) The whirling stick is fashionable about Cape
York. A small piece of wood is placed on a woom-
erah laid on the ground. The operator’s foot then
holds both firmly in position. The point of a stick
about 2Jft. long is rested in a depression, and the
fire-maker whirls the perpendicular stick rapidly
between his palms by rubbing. First tiny flame is
due in about 40 seconds.
(3) If the suburbanite can’t raise a blaze that way
he may try the lawyer-cane trick. The Papuan
mountaineer wears lengths of it coiled bracelet-wise
on his arm. When it is time to light up, your boy
takes a length off his arm and produces from his
girdle a scrap of “native cloth” (paper inulberry-
bark from inner lining of the tree),’ puts the kind-
ling in a cleft stick, places the stick on the ground,
and plants his foot firmly on it. Then he runs the
length of vine across the cleft and works it rapidly
backwards and forwards. Sparks are flying in about
30 seconds. By that time the vine is' about frayed
through and burnt black.
“Luluai”: “McNorth’.s” interesting par.
(B. 25/9/’l9) re Saibais native school impels me to
quote Joseph, an indentured native of Tornleo Island,
late German New Guinea. During German time
Joseph was employed as typist and general office-
boy at the Residency. He rattled the keys for
four years, but, for various reasons, was deposed at
the inception of British occupation. To-day lie

“Hay”: “Zanthus” (B. l/4/’2O) re-
marked that the name of “croweater” sticks to
the South Australian because the early settlers filled
rp with crows when tucker was short. Let me cor-
rect him. My father was one of the earliest settlers,
and he told me that he first heard the name at
Forest Creek diggings. It was started by one of
the intrepid overlanders, who declared that his
party travelled as the crow flew and lived on crows
to keep themselves from starving. The settlers from
the first never needed to go short of kangaroo meat.

is bordering on insanity through cockroaches dis-
puting possession of his premises with him. Here
is a dinkum ’roach eradicator. Mix a tablespoonful
of borax with a half-pound of oatmeal or anything
else the pests eat freely, and spread it along their
tracks. Keep the free lunch going for abo\it a
week. Shortly afterwards a new invasion may be
expected, ; These come , from the eggs left by the
vanquished army. Pass the bobix to these, and there-
after all will be peace.
“G.”: I know New Guinea well, but Rooke
Island is the only place I struck where circumcision
was universal. Once on my travels I met a brown
eunuch of about 40. He was the butt of his vil-
lage, and had charge of the women working in tin
sago. The gossips told me he had been emasculated
by his mother, though they couldn’t tell me what
grudge she had against society.
“Zanthus”: When the British abandoned
the old settlement at Raffles Bay (N.T.) in August,
1829, and left the North completely deserted until
Port Essington was occupied a few years later, two
convicts took to the bush and stayed behind, accord-
ing to Dr. T. B. Wilson, who was there at the time.
According to some others who cleared out but came
back before the ships left, their idea waß to wait
till the Macassar proas came dpwn trepanging, and
then get clear out of Australia with the Malays;
but no one seems to know whether it came off.
Another curious stray who blew into Port Raffles
while it was still occupied was a more-or*less Portu-
guese from Madras, Paul de Sois. He was brought
along in 1827 by the schooner Mary Elizabeth, which
had picked him up at Cape Flinders after he bad
lived for seven years with the natives. He and two

but the others died. Paul was nearly as dark in
color as the abos. themselves, and they treated him
very well, giving him a wife and other luxuries. In
fact, they were so fond of him that he had a job
to get away from them. He was sent back to
Madras, where he settled down in the bosom of his
family.

A Plain
Fact!
was apparently under the impression that as soon
as the foreigner landed on American soil some
subtle alchemy worked in his soul and converted
him there and then into a citizen imbued with the
admirable principles of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. The American now knows better.
But Mr. Brtuldon does not always face the
difficulties which he has himself admitted.
Thus:—
President Wilson, to secure the adoption of the
League of .Nations by the United States, has bigger
obstacles than mere personal animosities to sur-
mount. First there is the strong Washington tradi-
tion: to keep clear of European entanglements. A
doctrine which had everything to commend it 125
years ago, as wise guidance for a small population
of 13 struggling States, still remains potent under
totally different conditions. Whether 48 States,
with their financial and commercial ramifications all
over the world, should still cling to the tradition
is matter for grave consideration. A great people
of 107,000,000 can hardly to-day keep entirely aloof
from the troubles of a sick world. They must be
prepared for strong remedial action. Later on the
American will see his duty with a wider horizon.
Yes; but, as in that coal-mine, with 17 dif-
ferent pairs of eyes. A League of Nations
that purred peace was all very nice and
beautiful. It was when “the American”
reflected that the beast must also have claws
and be prepared to use them if it was to be
worth having that trouble arose among a
polyglot people; for the claw would have
to be used against one or more of the nations
whose language was spoken in that mine.
And that difficulty is not going to “vanish
with yesterday’s morning mists,” as this
optimist prophesies, though, with luck, the
time no doubt will come when the descend-
ants of the polyglots will make a fairly
homogeneous nation.
The Genius of George Moore
A lady wrote: “George Moore doesn’t
kiss, and tells.” She was a good critic, and
she gave him somewhere about his true
literary place ; but she persisted in rubbing
in his bad manners, as all his other critics.
Hence that good sentence in her paper stays
in my memory, from which her name and
the rest of her critique has gone. So she
didn’t do so much better than the other
critics, although she knew a good deal more
about her job.
Ilis manners are shockingly bad, of course.
If he could look at himself with a clear eye,
sloughing for a moment his skin of absorbed
egoism, he would be the first to say so.
Apart from that, which I really don’t think
is important, he writes a limpid prose of
such a simple, vibrant beauty as would make
him readers in a shocked and terrified nun-
nery, and glad readers.
As most pathfinders, Moore didn’t get a
fair deal. Nearly 40 years ago, when he
was looking at painting in Paris from the
aristocratic angle, the estate from which his
income was drawn became comparatively
non-productive. That was a fair enough
deal; no grown-up artist will complain »of
necessity being made his chief weapon. But
the date of the lucky accident puts Moore
back into the drear, domestic idealism of the
Victorian era at its worst; and Moore is the
creator of naturalism in modern English
letters. Which made his fight a heavy and
arduous one, and no doubt contributed largely
to his determination at all costs to shock
them: and to their determination that, what-
ever the evidence or the cost, he should he
called a shocking person and nothing else.
Moore is Irish; and for some years he had
a very good time with them.
His* first book. “Les Confessions d‘ un
Jeune llomme Anglais,” appeared in a Pans
newspaper. His French could hardly be as
good as his English, but it is very smooth
and natural, easv and unaffected. The frank,
self-revelation of the unattractive, sensuous,
rather dilettante young man made its
Parisian artistic hit before it nearly killed
them in London in comfortable expressive
English prose. “Esther Waters” and “A
Mummer’s Wife” cut the dilettante out of
the make-up entirely, and started the habit
of calling spades spades. They were depress-
ing spades—kitchen-maids and horseracing,
strolling actresses and beer, seamy and ter-
ribly natural and tragic. Not fair reflec-
tions of life, inasmuch as they dealt too per-
sistently with the darkness of its material
quality, equally persistently standing out of
the light of its lantern of ideal, which makes
the combination of the two possible. But
good books, nevertheless; powerful and grim,
interesting for all their falseness of angle.
“Evelyn Innes” and its sequel adjusted the
angle more correctly; some clean, bright
places were discovered on the spade, and the
steady necessity of shocking them was being
slowly worn out by the spirit that was the
real George Moore.
“The Lake,” “The Untilled Field” and
“Muslin” can be bracketed together. I think,
as rather disappointing steps on the way—
not disappointing from the point of view
of the novel-readers, but from that of the
George Moore readers. Whatever setbacks
these in their patience suffered, however,
were made good to them a hundredfold in
“Memoirs of My Dead Life.” Here was
the first confirmation of their faith. The
savage criticisms, the childish animus of the
voices in the horror-stricken city, had no
power against work like that. The book
makes a record of events, important and
unimportant, in Moore’s past. There was
plenty for London to weep for. plenty of bad
manners; but. at last, it didn’t matter a
rap. Here was Moore walking again the
paths he had trod in his youth, still unat-
tractive and conceited, but putting the very
spirit of his thoughts upon his paper in
singing liquid prose as easy as a robin’s
voice. Again and again I have read the
book, to be rewarded always, first as last,
by the same glow of fervent admiration of
the quintessential art of expression. The
things that are distasteful in the work, the
sensuality, the nature of some of the epi-
sodes of Moore’s past, can no more destroy
the book’s value as literature than the
critics’ frantic warnings could. It is no
students’ book ; it is not a “popular” book,
notwithstanding much of its contents; it is
a book for everyone, and for .literature. If
everyone is a bit young when he reads of
Doris and -the other women, it is a pity, I
suppose; but can't everyone pick up a dozen
Dorises on any bookstall? And, if he is
after Dorises, hadn’t he better get them
good? They might tempt him to turn the
pages and read “Spring in Normandy" and
“Resurgam,” forgetting very soon all about
Dorises and other unimportant things.
Nothing in the world interests Moore half
as much as Moore does. That is not such
bad manners in a book as in a room ; most
hooks are about the author. In the “Hail
and Farewell” trilogy, the A re. Salve and
1 ale, Moore goes on talking about him.
Riper and firmer than the "Memoirs.” the
books reveal more strongly the unattractive
qualities already established, but speaking
of them as literature I am holding back all
the superlatives and enthusiastic Avords I
ever heard. The vitality, the pulsing truth
of every musical thought are the robin’s
again, coming out of Moore’s mind upon his
paper as easily as that bird sings. In the
trilogy and the “Memoirs.” I have the un-
deniable truth of his mind. I am satisfied
that this is George Moore, expressed to me
without charm or artistry, or any ideal
tricks, and yet- embodying all the ideal that
has ever made sunshine, and life and
laughter and death, out of black and white.
He sits in his room in Ely-place in Dublin,
and as the years pass before him he writes
them down, clearly and truly. At times he
goes out of his room, and touches the fringe
of the Celtic renaissance; consorts with
Yeats, Edward Martin. “A.E..” Douglas
Hyde. and the other shadows that
the years bring; but it is all nothing
to him. In some of the years he writes
“Lewis Seymour and Some Women,” and
a book made out of the Gospels, and what
not; but that, too, is all nothing to him.
He is George Moore, unpopular, spiteful,
growing less likeable as the years go by;
and his business in the world is the writing
of George Moore. In these four beautiful
books he has done that to date for me. I
don't like him —lots of him I hate —but his
good song of himself, his waking and falling
asleep, his pain and his triviality, his shock-
ing bad manners, I keep as the best four
examples in my craft and language that a
living man has given me.
Hilary Lofting.
The Purple Land We Lost
For various reasons, of which the scarcity
of a knowledge of Spanish is one, Australia
knows very little about its neighbors across
the Pacific in South America. English his-
torians, too, have consistently overlooked
the remarkable narrowness with which Eng-
land missed playing there a great part for
good or ill. They have treated Sir Hume
Popham’s successful expedition from Cape-
town to Buenos Ayres in 180(5 and the sub-
sequent failure of General Whitelocke, if
they have mentioned these things at all, as
mere episodes. It has beep left for a U.S.A.
historian, William Spence Robertson, in his
new Rise of the Spanish-A inerican Republics,
to show how the South Pacific might well have
become a British lake if things had gone
a little differently just over a century ago.
As early as 1790 Francisco dc Miranda,
the Venezuelan patriot—or adventurer,
according to your point of view—had inter-
ested William Pitt in plans for overthrowing
the rule of Spain in America. (Incidentally
Miranda suggested in 1797 the cutting of
a canal across the isthmus of Panama.) A
draft of a proclamation setting up a pro-
visional local government to replace the
Spanish regime was found amongst Pitt's
papers later. Miranda had also ideas for
a union of the Anglo-Saxon race; at least
he urged that Britain and the United
States should join in freeing Spanish-
Ameriea and be rewarded by trade and other
concessions and form a Britisli-pa/i-Ameri-
can League. Popham was one of those who
became interested in Miranda’s projects,
which he kept pushing before British Min-
isters off and on for 20 years. He came
nearest to getting something done in June.
1808, when it was decided to send Sir Arthur
Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington,
with 10,000 soldiers, to help execute Miran-
designs. The troops were collected
at Cork, Ireland, and a fleet was gathered
there; and then suddenly it was decided to
divert Wellesley and his men to fight Napo-
leon in Spain. Twenty-seven years later
AYellington wrote :
I think I never had a, more difficult business than
when the Government bade me tell Miranda that we
would have nothing to do with his plan.
One part of Miranda’s reply when he was
told was possibly true enough. He said:
What grieves me is that there never was
such an opportunity thrown away.” W.
H. Hudson once wrote a storv about Uru-
guay with the sub-title “The Purple Land
That England Lost,” and remarked in his
preface that most people had forgotten that
she ever had it. But if this expedition had
sailed it might have led to British influence
being established throughout Spanish-
America. That the time was ripe for throw-
ing off the rule of Spain the events of the
next dozen years showed clearly. With
Britain established in Australia on one side
of the Pacific and in South America on the
other well, how would historv have been
Avritten?
It was, by the way. during the years when
England was at war with Spain and Mi-
randa was pressing his vast designs that
Campbell and other privateers and buccaneers
sailing out of Sydney did their bit to singe
the King of Spain’s beard by raids on the
I aeific coast of South America.
The Inky Way
“The Religious Editor” on the other fel-
low’s books:—
I caught a visitor at it the other night. AVhile
he talked to me he was taking stock of my book-
shelves. “Yes,” I said, “that’s your coov of ‘ln
a Canoe Through Greenland.’ I haven’t found time
to read it yet. Chances are I never will read it.
But if you don’t mind I’ll keep it there just as a
reminder of you.” He was inclined to make a fuss
about it, and tried to get it back by telling me
that he had promised to lend it to another chap.
But I’m too old a borrower to be taken in with
that sort of stuff. I used to have a conscience
about books, but something has killed the nerve.
My wife, like a tidy soul, frets if Smith has a
couple of books of mine; but I try to restrain her,
because so long as I feel that Smith has some of my
property I can face the world and Jones, two of
whose volumes PTace my shelves. At times I’ve
thought of putting a curtain in front of my loan
collection, just to keep the attention of my visitors
from wandering; but, after all, that wouldn’t be a
fair thing—they couldn’t see that their property was
still safe. And what if 1 do forget to return
Jones’s books, or if Smith goes away and takes my
property with him? NVhat more pleasant memorial
can a man have than a book with his name in it
standing oil his friend’s shelves? In after years
1 open Jones’s l.ook and idly wonder where and how
he is. Smith, 1 hope, will do the same for me.
But there is an elephant in the ointment when the
cherished autographed book I lent Smith years before
comes back to me, “with com pliments,” from the
secondhand department of some bookselling house, or
some friend drops in and says he “picked up” a book
of mine for 2d. Before my book (with me in it)
could be “picked up” it must have been dropped—
and I hate being dropped and rescued by a third
person for 2d. Rather than this I would reform
my habits and start returning books in the old-
fashioned way.
The Ballad of a Poet’s Pen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The singer’s goods were seized for debt
At springtime of the year;
The singer’s pen, with rhyming wet,
Lay by the auctioneer.
And, clowning like a goose's foal,
Or chicken of the ass,
The auctioneer, with bumble soul.
Brought all his quips to grass.
1 ween lie was a weary wight,
And ragged at the mouth,
Who toiled for mirth, in mirth’s despite,
Like penguins of the South.
A waddle-jest to sell a chair,
A flounder-thought to clear
The thing they call a duchess pair
When washerqueens arc near.
The sweat upon his hasty nose
In beaded bubbles shone,
The while in agony uprose
Ilis “Going! Going! Gone!”
Five shillings for an idle clock—•
A table sold for ten ;
And then, bv its grey feather lock,
He seized the singer’s pen.
He led it rudclv through the air,
Intent with mirth to kill
The haggling caution and the care
That kept the buyers still.
He held it up. “Lot fifty-nine!
What offers? See it flame!
The splendid instrument divine
. That made a poet’s name!”
Thin was the giggle round his knees,
Like rat-scorn of a hen;
And, as it died into a wheeze,
Fire stirred within the pen.
It found a soul; mesmeric force
Moved in its draggled plume;
It, knew its purpose and its course;
Its magic burst in bloom.
“What offers?” One said “Half a crown.’
“Four shillings!” “Five!” “Six!” “Eight!”
The clamorous voices rose to drown
The mirth that came too late.
A Jew that looked like Shylock’s ghost
To judgment come afresh
Raised o'er the shilling-brawling host
Three pounds of nasal flesh.
“Ten pounds I bid!” The auctioneer
In sheer surprise turned green.
“Twelve!” roared a voice made round by beer.
The Hebrew lisped “Fifteen!”
It reached the hundred in three bids ;
The room grew mad with sound.
The thunder of the yobs and vids
Clashed upward pound on pound.
The auctioneer pulled off his shirt;
He fought with blistered breath.
Come wrath, come doom, howe’er it hurt,
Men sought that prize or death.
Up. up to realms of high finance
The furious storm arose;
One Israelite was seen to dance
So hard he burst his nose.
The Hallelujah chorus blent
AVith German hymns of hate
AVas like the awful sound that rent
The quiet of the State.
The Minister for Public Health
Rushed headlong down the street
A I'd brought three-quarters of his wealth
The sudden call to meet.
The Governor with wonder saw
The passing of the throng:
And. closing his remarks with “Haw!”
Brought all his suite along.
And fishermen and draper kings
And simple folk in drink
Shot towards the mart as if on springs
To act ere they could think.
The bid barrage, the thunderous yell
Seemed to the auctioneer
As when the Tower of Babel fell
On Nimrod’s purple ear.
Yet manfully he stood his ground
Till few could nod or speak,
And in an awful lapse of sound
He heard the million squeak.
A syndicate in concert cried—-
One thin, victorious yell—
The auctioneer, exhausted, died
■lust as his hammer fell.
One million pounds! The joyous quill,
Its fount of magic spent.
Ruffled its hot triumphant frill
And sighed in deep content.
And somewhere, in a sad retreat,
They found the singer hid
And brought and offered at his feet
The remnant of the bid.
The sixty pounds of debt were paid,
He stood sublime and free;
For every daylight ghost was laid
To all eternity.
He read the cheque with quiet eyes.
“At length,” said he, “do men
Begin to somewhat realise
The value of my pen.”

“Weasel”: The fact that ‘‘prime red fish”
is £GOO a ton on the China market has given
a fillip to the Northern Territory’s oldest
industry, the collecting of trepang, which
the Macassar Malays carried on long before
there was any white settlement. Prepara-
tions are being made at Darwin to shake
up trepanning, which lias not been very
brisk for some time. On their side the
Thursday Island trepangers have been mak-
ing pots of money.
“Hamer”: In a complex civilisation
there is no knowing who may be hit by a
stone thrown at random. A dejected Sydney
vendor of prawns has just confided to me
that the raising of beer a penny a glass lias
put him on the rocks. In normal times his
customers are mainly people elated by a
few glasses. But the beer-increase has cre-
ated a partial strike; and the prawn-seller
weeps that people who formerly paused by
his basket now pass by disdainfully.
“Widgee”: As to the value of blue-gum,
some of. which served for (54 years in a
N. S. Wales Railway Department waggon
(B. l/4/’2O), I know of one young sawm Her
who, having done remarkably well in selling
building-sizes of hardwood, with blue-gum
"on the side” for coachbuilders, has recently
ceased turning out building-timbers and is
going in entirely for the blue-gum trade,
with highly satisfactory results and pros-
pects. Australian timbers only need ad-
vertisement —and conservation.
■***■*
“Tiger”; At Exeter, on, the West Tamar
(Tas.), three business men —butcher, baker
and storekeeper—have an arrangement
between themselves for the taking and deli-
very of orders round the large Orcharding
and farming districts which they serve. The
grocer has carrier-pigeons, which he takes out
oti the rounds for orders for the three turns.
When the released birds arrive with the
orders, the goods are put up and delivered
by the butcher or baker within a few hours.
In this way they supply about 10 different
settlements along the Tamar without loss of
time or duplication of running. It is, I
think, the only case on record in Australia
of business being accelerated by the use of
pigeons.
“0.K,”: There is such a boom in silver
that crown pieces issued in commemoration
of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee are worth about
30 p.c. more than face value as mere pieces
of metal, and the first mintage of Australian
silver, bearing the image of the late Edward,
would be worth preserving for its silver’s
sake if one could be sure of .silver keeping its
present value, apart from the rising market
that collectors are making for it. This King
Edward issue amounted to only £40,000, and
was not enough to meet the demands of the
world’s great army of coin collectors. Their
expensive pastime was interrupted by the
war, but is now going stronger than ever,
and every enthusiast wants at least one
specimen of Australia’s first silver mintage.
* * * *
“Murkah”: Thanks to the enterprise of
one firm, there is no need to go outside
Australia for ship-wireless machinery of any
kind. From the whirling motor that pro-
vides the right brand of “juice” to the aerial,
and, on the receiving side, from the “sky-
wires,” through the ultra-sensitive audion
detector to the telephones, with their 1000-
feet of hair-fine wire, the gear is manufac-
tured in Australia. The most meritorious
performance is the receiving set. I lately
served two years-odd with the R.A.N. Radio
Service. Therefore I know what I'm talk-
ing about when I say that the Navy Depart-
ment, which leans on the Yank for detect-
ing instruments, has nothing to compare wit If
this Australian-made receiver. From a
national point of view leaning on the
foreigner is poor patriotism in any circum-
stances. Going to him for an article of
wliic-h a better sample is produced at your
own door is some brand of lunacy.
“Sixo”: Re “Dilly Flower” (B. l/4/’2O)
and the prospects of the bee industry in
Aussie. Bees have a utility over and above
their production of honey and wax, and it
is being exploited to .an increasing extent in
more up-to-date countries. After Fritz had
won the war I had an opportunity of visit-
ing the United States, and found the bee
employed on almost every fruit farm. The
American fruitgrower calculates that by en-
suring fertilisation of practically every blos-
som bees increase his fruit crop by at least
100 per cent. They are very extensively used
in the cranberry orchards, where their aid is
held to have trebled the crops. Here in
Aussie they should do even better, as climatic
conditions are much more suitable, and they
should be a paying proposition for the
oichardist, even if the honey return was
trifling. With honey, like all other food-
stuffs; at gyeatly-enhanced prices, and wax
increasing in value almost daily, the bee
should be a much more constant lodger in
our orchards than it is.

I wonder- what he thought of it —
If his pale wraith got in the way

There his linoleum lies in rolls.
And someone shouts of “seven pound ten."
These stolid “envelopes of souls”
Are, first of all, plain business men,

While he had cash, declared him “white.”
And now the friendship’s at an end.

Westralia’s one and only sculptor, Peter
Porcelli, who has executed most of the mem-
orial statues in and around Perth, is now on
his biggest job. He has been commissioned
to sculp a 30ft. obelisk in memory oi
Guildford men killed in action. Porcelli’s
most notable works to date are the statues
of Alex. Forrest and C. Y. O Connor.
Red-tape excelled itself the other day
when a Customs official collected lbs. Uk as
dutv on a Military Medal won by an officer
who had died abroad, prooably classing it
as personal apparel n.e.i. ihen superior
authorities spoiled the record by saying that
it was all a mistake and handing back the
10s. 6d. The genius who made the charge
was well in line with the Darwin official
who wanted to search Ross Smith s aero-
plane for contraband.
“0.L.”: No profiteer is more rapacious
than the small one. Owing to the. scarcity
of coal, Melbourne’s cement supplies have
of late been painfully short, to the embar-
rassment of many housebuilders and contrac-
tors. Dealers holding a few bags of cement
soon raised their prices until the top notch
was reached at lbs. .Yet, at the time that
such suoplies were being sold to builders in
urgent need of a little lot of cement to finish
off fireplaces, coppers and so on, cement-
manufacturing firms were selling their
reserves at 7s. bd. and Bs. a bag, and these
were very high rates.
“Toby C.”: The Abedesa recently left
Darwin for London via southern ports with
a cargo of 1500 tons of frozen beef from
Yestey’s. A gang of 04 wharfies handled the
produce at the waterside, and each man re-
ceived £lOl for his share in the job. They
worked 13 shifts but were paid for 17 of
12 hours. Another gang of SO men who
handled the cargo at Vestey’s works drew
the same sum as the wharfies. The men who
handled another meat-boat a few days previ-
ously drew £l7 per man for a 48-hour shift.
Yestey’s paid out £15,000 on the two boats.
Darwin is a costly port these times: goods
landed there cost more to remove from the
wharf to the bond store 400yds. away than
they cost to bring from Sydney to the wharf-
side ! It is reported that may not
operate again for three years.
The new 4 r ic. executive of the A.L.P. is
as mixed a mob as you could muster any-
where. John Barnes, who as a Senator
sympathised with Bolshevism, is president.
Hogan, M.L.A., is a vice-president, and
McNamara, M.L.C.. is a member of the com-
mittee, with Slater, M.L.A., who carried a
stretcher in Flanders. Another ex-soldier
is lawyer Richard (’vouch, the ex-Liberal
ex-M.H.R. Two women arc in the crowd —
Mary John Grant, who at the Federal elec-
tions was refused endorsement as a Labor
candidate for Kooyong, and Mrs. Felstead.
The others include T. C. Carey, who has
made more unsuccessful attempts to reach
Parliament than any other member; Ivatz-
and-feathers ; Scullin, ex-M.H.R.; and lawyer
Maurice Blackburn, ex-M.L.A.; with a few
old-stagers in Holloway. Bennett and Gill.
“Bad Australian” holds a review: —
Although 1 have never met the Prince of Wales
I have consorted with potentates of some tonnage
in my time.
1 had a nodding' acquaintance with General Pando,
who was a ruler of sorts, and I had the palabra
with Pedro Montt, of Chile, on divers occasions,
notably when I was commissioned to fire off a con-
gratulatory address to him on the inauguration of
a public work which at the time was regarded as
of great importance to Chilian interests. My Spanish
was rather rocky, but I tackled the job in the
Australian way. However, I had no need for worry,
as by the time my piece was due most of the
distinyuidos present, being unused to the altitude
at which the function was held (about 10,000 ft.
above sea-level), were overcome by mountain sick-
ness or the wine or the grub or all combined. At
the close of the proceedings the military band which
accompanied the Presidential party, after playing
the National Hymn, tackled “Gorsave” out of com-
pliment to the money behind the job, but collapsed
before they were half-way through, one of the musi-
cians getting iTi his breathless comment as he doubled
up: “Caramba, seiiores! These English are a hard
crowd, but their Himno Nacional —what thing so
barbarous ?”
Then there was Henry of Prussia, whom I escorted
on a railway journey across the Andes. He was
exceedingly affable and rather English in his manner,
and more like a human being than a Prince.
Although he didn’t seem to worry about the scenery
or the great natural resources of the region, he
was greatly interested in the rolling stock. At one
station his curiosity led him to borrow a suit of
“blues” and go under an engine of English make
Which had superseded a German type previously
used on the line. He talked like a book on
mechanical engineering and the relative merits and
demerits of British and German machinery.
Teddy Roosevelt was on my list, too. Teddy
was due at our pueblo after crossing the mountains
from Chile, on his way to discover that “new
river in Brazil, and I went along to say “howdy
before the official reception by the Gobernador of
the Province. About 200 of the Governor’s half-
breed, tin-waistcoated, cut-throat escuadron were
drawn tip outside the station, but the head serang
himself was considerably overdue. However, at last,
old Gallo del Monte arrived, apologised profusely
for the delay, and fired off the usual florid speech.
Teddy hopped into the official coach, the tin waist-
coats shook themselves into shape, the band struck
up the National Hymn and the procession got under
way amid yells of “Viva los Estados Unidos. Viva
Roos-e-fcl! Viva el Tedi!”
Then there was the Duke of Orleans, who with luck
might have been a potentate and who, though of
no great weight, had a certain interest for Aus-
tralians.
And Garry 1., who claimed to be “King all about
the plurrv Burnett” away back in the last cen-
tury. Garry was hardworking, intelligent and fairly
honest and reliable as kings go, and although he
was frequently drunk and belted his consorts with
a club. I never heard that he had openly repudiated
any of them.
But the most picturesque potentate of the crowd
was Jacques Lebaudy, “Emperor of the Sahara.'
who once put it to me over a glass of pisco in a
pulperia, away up in the Andes, that I should “get
togezzer a few hondred of your frien’s, zose Chilian
bandidos,” while he found “ze maehine-gon, ze
rifle an’ ze ozzer sings.” We were then to invade
Bolivia and “w'at you call raise Hell.” Jack was
to be “ze Presidente” and “you, Henree, you will
be my chief Ministro an’ mak’ ze good tarn wiz
your bandidos.” I advised him to send for someone
else, whereupon he cursed me in four different lan-
guages and went out to rake up another chief fili-
buster and form his provisional government.


Probably there are no people who
eat to such excess as the Aus-
tralians. From early in the morn-
ing till late at night they are eating
and drinking. Nature cannot stand such a strain,
and consequently unless he?p is given injurious effects
follow, too numerous to mention here but well known
to most people. You are told to eat anything, and
as much as you like so long as you take some brand
of digestive tablet afterwards. It cannot be done;
Nature can only carry just so much and no more
unless effective assistance is given. In Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills a remedy is at hand that will
effectively assist Nature to carry excessive burdens,
and in a natural way assist in the digestion and
assimilation of food. No one is recommended to
over-eat, but if they do and have recourse at once to
a dose of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, then soon
the digestive system will be in perfect order, and
can be kept right if care is exercised regarding the
quantity of food, and a Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pill is taken occasionally.

“Sixenate” : The man who runs the Em-

“Rusty” Tom Richards, one time amongst
the best of football forwards in Australia.
Leading the pack in France with the Ist
Battalion he scored an M.C. and his

which blew him up in April, 1918.
Alex. W. R. James, of the Ist Battalion
Rifle Brigade, Woolwich fEng.), writes
from Mesopotamia begging The Bulletin

world.” His father (who also belonged to

used to live in Summer Hill, Sydney ; and
it is of this family that information is
sought.

woman will collect his half-guinea.
‘•Hugh Stone”: In Wellington (M.L.) the
other day the last call came to Aubrey
Douglas, an old-time Australian burnt-cork
artist, best known for his “Whistling Coon.”
When the minstrel business began to leak a
quarter of a century ago, Aubrey and his
wife did the shearing-sheds in the back coun-
try of the Ma State, and then went to M.L.
with a travelling waxwork show. When
death knocked he was scene-shifting at the
Grand Opera House.
The Fates are grim jesters. A Geelong
young woman was admitted to hospital suf-
fering from what was supposed to he appen-
dicitis. When examination was made a
piece of a broken penholder was found to
have pierced the peritoneum, and to be still
in her body. The case was hopeless, and
she died. It was then disclosed that the
girl had had one child, and, fearing another
was coining, had taken steps to prevent it.
But the medical examination showed that
there were no indications of pregnancy:
she had killed herself without cause.
“Smike”: Melbourne is changing hands at
towering prices. Twenty-five feet three inches
of frontage, carrying a three-storey building,
at 48-50 Elizabeth-street, brought £lOOO a
foot, and another three-storey place on 16ft.
of ground at 67 Swans.ton-street was
auctioned for £18,050, or about £ll2B per
foot. Higher up, at 163-5 Swanston-street,
a three-storey cafe, with a frontage of 32ft..
was hammered up to £37,168, and caught £l6O
more a foot than an adjoining block sold a
few weeks back. This land is almost next
door to the large Swanston and Little Col-
lins-street corner which Charles Swanston
acquired for £3O at the land sale in June,
1837.
“Murkah”: It seems odd, but it is a fact,
that the qualities which enabled “Mulga’s”
champion horse-tailer (B. 25/3/’2O) to pick
his own bells from among the jangle of
scores would also have made him a topnotch
wireless operator. In spite of many alleged
mechanical aids to prevent interference,
dozens of signals besides those required are
always audible in the receiving telephones,
particularly in crowded areas like the Eng-
lish Channel and off New York. Every wire-
less set has its own note; and if it w’asn’t
for the ability of the human ear to tune
itself to these trifling differences of pitch
and other characteristics, and follow’ them
through the maze, wireless telegraphy w’ould
be almost an impossibility.
“Goldarn”: There’s a strong strain .of
poetry in the Yank. It doesn’t show until
he sees dahlers spouting up out of the
earth; then he bursts into song. Hogtown,
a beautifully-named Texan place, lately
found that it w r as sitting on oil. Now
everybody’s rich, and a Cosmopolitan man
w’ent down to do a prose poem about the
new millionaires of Dpsdemona. (They
changed Hogtowm’s name w r hen they became
rich.) One verse :
Old man Duke, who has more oil-wells now
than his dog has fleas, bought himself a new
waggon and grabbed off a twelve-dollar-a-day boom-
job of hauling oil-rig stuff. He simply couldn’t
stand to see a Job like that going to waste, 12 dollars
being more than he’d ever been able to earn in a
whole week before God came down and put His
arm around that part of Texas.
I like that image of God putting His arm
around Desdemona (late Hogtown) and
slily filling its pockets with genuine green-
backs. It throws a new’ light on the phrase
“Almighty Dollar.”
“Awaruite”: The Bulletin (8/4/’2O), in
dealing with the Boers and their discontent,
hasn’t covered all the ground. In Oom
Paul’s time a high Protective tariff was in
operation, particularly dealing with food-
stuffs that could be produced there. This
tariff made farming and allied industries
profitable to the Boer landholders, and kept
them and their sons employed at w’hat they
are most suited for. British administration
after the war abolished this protection,
which, as foreseen by the London Jew’s,
forced the Boers to come in and w’orlc in the
mines, an occupation for w’hich they are
unfitted. To-day the cos. employ hundreds
of these men as learners on machines at ss.
per day. and when the probationary period
is over fire them off. The intense hatred
of the Boer for the cynical superiority of
the Englishman, combined with starvation
wages paid to their sons in the “sure-death
atmosphere” of the Rand mines, is keeping
up a bar that w'ill never be broken down
w’hde the gold and the Peruvian type of Jew
last.

Benger’s Food differs from all others because it contains

This means much, because the inability to digest milk—
and only by proper digestion is its nourishment obtained
-is very common. Always use
ã
Food
for backward Infants, Invalids, and Aged persons because
evm the weakliest among these obtain the full benefit of
the milk, and all enjoy and thrive upon it.

Dodge Brothers Will
Continue Same Policies.
Letter read at Chicago Meeting refers to
Continuation of Ideals as Tribute to Late
President.
Definite assurance that there would be no
change in the policies of Dodge Brothers.
Detroit, automobile manufacturers, as a
result of the recent death of John F. Dodge,
president, was given to dealers at a meet-
ing in the Blaekstone Hotel, in Chicago,
during the automobile show there. January
2S. The assurance came in the form of a
letter addressed to the dealers by Horace
E. Dodge, now at the head of the business,
and read at the meeting by George C.
Hubbs. assistant general sales manager. The
letter follows:—
"I regret exceedingly that I cannot
be with you this afternoon to person-
ally express my own and my brother’s
appreciation of your work during the
past year, but on account of my recent
illness I am obliged to forego that
pleasure.
The late Mr. John F. Dodge.
"1 do wish, however, to as strongly
as possible impress upon each one
of you that my brother and I have
thoroughly appreciated the loyal
•support you have given Dodge
Brothers during the past year.
“The passing of my dear brother,
Mr. John F. Dodge, is to me, person-
ally, a loss so great that I hesitate
to look forward to the years without
his companionship, our lives having
been, as you all know, practically
inseparable since our childhood.
“I have the same pride in the ac-
complishments of Dodge Brothers
that inspired him, and I feel that we
can pay no greater tribute to his
memory than to carry forward the
plans and aspirations which he and
myself had for the future of the busi-
ness.
"The business will be conducted in
the future exactly as it has been in
the past—the same principles of
honor, honesty and integrity that
dominated his life will continue to
dominate the business of Dodge
Brothers. There will be no. change,
and you can safely make your plans
for the future in reliance upon the
same whole-hearted support of Dodge
Brothers that has been given to you in
the past.”
The Standardised Motors, Limited,
dealers in N.S.W. for Dodge Brothers
Motor Cars, are fully appreciative of the
value of following Dodge Brothers’ policy,
and to that end they have incorporated into
their selling methods the various ideas sub-
mitted to them by their Principals from
time to time.

“His Little Widows” at Melbourne Tivoli
is the story of a Wild Cat specialist, Pete
Lloyd, who, being left- 3,000,000 dollars by
a Mormon uncle, drifts into polygamy as
a condition of his inheritance. Uncle’s 11
widows have to be taken with the coin,
and a tumultuous amount of female besets
the lad ; but he proves a desperately callow
partner, whilst the wives seem to be in
hard training for a game of postman’s
knock. Only one of l.is belongings, bluff
and buxom Lucinda, shows even a moderate
yearning for his company; two others, Anna-
belle and Marilla, go so far as to cut him
out of their visiting hours and indulge in
torpid canoodle with his pals Jack Gray-
son and Biff Hale. These two and Pete
have the biggest share of the conversation,
and generally contribute a tootle to the
musical numbers, but they are as artistically
incomplete as the barebacked Venuses whose
expensive stockings flare in the farground.
The best of the three is Hugh Steyne, who
is cast as Riff Hale, but speedily dis-
closes that Biff is a nom-de-gloom. llis
rather fragile cheerfulness is less mournful
than the girlish futility of William Valen-
tine, who, as Jack Grayson, merely wears
the illegitimate babe of a Charlie Chaplin
moustache and provides an outing for two
or three exquisite suits. Pete is played
by a buzzing new arrival who calls himself
London, but who, judged by his queer collec-
tion of faces, might well restrict it to Seven
Dials. Vera Pearce lends affluent contours
to the role of Blanche Hale, and occasionally
her pleasing voice adorns the tale, but her
part is small, about 1-candle power. Marie
La Varre has a listless billet as a Mormon
lady touched by the inconspicuous romance
proffered in the toothy grin of Hugh Steyne.
Muriel Cathcart is likewise doomed to sleep-
ing sickness as the mortgagee of young
Valentine’s emotions. Kitty Barlowe, a
super-Juno, is another example of talent
overwhelmed by tonnage. As Lucinda her
voice is packed with languid contentment,
but her manner doesn’t realise half her amor-
ous intention. Lawrence Hardinge, as a
Mormon elder, leads a black, brooding, side-
whiskered chorus, made more menacing by
brollies and high stovepipe hats. The scenery
is bright enough to fit the story, and the
dressing is excellent, especially in Act 1,
where the frocks gambol up the major scale
of yellow, running through all the notes of
canary and topaz to a deafening shrill of
orange in alt.

wash-tub, on the
pirate ship, or knit-
ting primly in the
side-car of a motor-
cycle that won’t go but merely explodes, has
Jack Cannot (Mr. Hubbard) as chief assist-
ant. Les Coney, an Indian colonel tempo-
rarily crazed with rage, bursts into the Hub-
bards’ panto, laundry to complain about the
way liis shirt has been starched at the wrong
end. He is felled with an axe by Mr. Hub-
bard, who then produces a notebook and
carefully records the dazed customer’s com-
plaint—the one about the washing. Prin-
cipal-boy Marjorie Carlisle, in “By the
Camp Fire,” is the sort of coon-song Aus-
tralian bushman who would divert the
Prince more than any kangaroo hunt. She
does her pioneering in extremely short pants
and long hose of russet-brown, high-heeled
shoes, a red shirt blouse and a slouch hat
rakishly' tilted—the sort of Christopher
Columbus you can see any day the other
side of Wonnaminta if you drink the right
quantity of the right poison. Ethel Walker
glitters like a walking wedding-cake as the
Fairy Queen, and her voice commands atten-
tion. Elsie Parkes solo-dances joyously, and
Kelso Henderson has a busy evening, first
as Elsie’s partner and then as the sole sup-
port of Daisy Yates in some modern acro-
batic dances. Moon and Morris earn their
salaries and something over in a capitally-
dressed and made-up Mutt and Jeff act with
a dancing finale. There is a sort of costume
cyclone blowing all the time, and the stage
staff is kept on the jump with 18 changes
of W. and J. Rowell scenery. Robert Keers
is a busy orchestral chief, and ballet mis-
tress Alice Pax-kes deserved her first-night
“call.”

“The Digger-Pierrots,” now at Sydney
Royal under J,C.W. management, are a
cheery lot of young Maoriland soldiers who
have 10 of their total parade force of 21 in

sight of the uniformed bands puts the audi-
ence in an indulgent mood, and the light

in a friendly spirit. It is about best-
amateur standard. The co.’s “leading lady”
is Stanley Lawson, programmed as of the

G. P. Hanna gives a clever imitation of an
old Scotch minister, Laslett Exton tenors
little love-songs sweetly, and a male quar-
tette looks as holy as a country-church choir
while solemnly imitating banjoes.
The Mermaid Play Society’s production of
“The Winter’s Tale,” at Melba Hall, Mel-
bourne, last week, was most attractive when
Isabel Handley held the stage. Miss Hand-
ley’s Perdita was charmingly unaffected and
was free from the suggestion of elocutionary
pedantry noticeable in the work of Carrie
Haase as Hermione. Miss Haase acted
with becoming composure, but she had the
air of reciting the Bard’s English for the
pleasure of giving her voice a night out.
Miss Quong’s Paulina w r as strongly pic-
tured, but in Paulina’s famous snort at
Leontes she had an emotional orgy that
recalled the tragedy queen of a bygone age.
Miss Quong’s audible gasps in the scene
imply that she hasn’t the breath for denuncia-
tion at a very fast tempo. Westley
Wright, as Leontes, was wrapped in indif-
ferent gloom, and the feature of N. F. Mit-
chell’s Polixenes was his idea of conveying
devilish debonairness with a stiff, jaunty mo.
and a light “Ha. ha!” F. B. Nicholls (Flori-
zel), Stewart Macky (Cleomenes) and D.
W. Burbidge (Antigonous) histrionically
sagged superfluous on the stage, and the
tasteful style of Malcolm Skurrie as Camillo
was a welcome relief from the ineptitude of
other amateurs in much bigger parts. W.
G. Southwell’s Old Shepherd was also pretty
good, and Arthur Goodsall, as Time, the
Chorus, had the diction of an artist. The
only unhappy incidental was Hermione’s
dummy baby, which was occasionally treated
like a parcel, amid the irreverent giggles of
numerous schoolgirls and the anguished
frowns of the Bardolaters present.
“The Sleeping Beauty,” now on view at
Sydney Criterion, is proving alihost un-
cannily popular with many N. S. Wales
unionists. Asked by the management to
provide a scientific explanation of the plieno-
menon, Prof. Mammoth Hibrow, the emi-
nent industrial psychologist, at once replied:
“There is an inalienable tendency in human-
ity to flock to those spectacles which evoke
in the bosoms of the onlookers emotions of
sympathy or keen approval. The Criterion
provides a sight unique hitherto in the
annals, of Labor —that of an employee who
sleeps for 100 years, and gets paid for it.
Granted that” “Cut it out,” interrupted
the management understandingly, and led the
way to the refreshment bureau.

Lyceum and Lyric set about answering the
large starry note of interrogation plucked at
by ghost hands that has been appearing in
the papers for weeks past. They answer it
in the Scotch way by propounding another
riddle. In fact, Griffiths has got together
such a string of leading questions that the
picture resolves itself into a sort of arraign-
ment of the Almighty. Lillian Gish and
Robert Harron play lead. Under the same
roofs “The Grey Wolf’s Ghost” makes a
striking d6but in a lynching act. Ilaymarket
and Globe present Wm. Hart as Buckskin
Hamilton, a guide on the Santa Fe trail, who
has fallen in love with the sister of the card
cheat , who has murdered his beloved young
brother. Olive Thomas gets into a suit
of dungarees, calls herself Flotsam, and
lives in a lighthouse with the express pur-
pose of marrying a Prince—not one of
the poor, royal, two-a-penny sort, but a
real dream prince. Of course the charming
and cultured young man turns up and car-
ries Flotsam into a life of riches and ease.
This is at the Strand and Empress. Mary
Miles Minter makes an attractive entrance
at the Lyric as .Joan Hope, whose clad is
a chewing-gum king.
Another Melbourne picture-show :
A. E. Newbury, exhibiting 91 canvases at Melbourne
Athenaeum, impresses one with the. sincerity and mod-
esty with which he paints easy everyday scenes.
His attitude to Nature is very near to Corot’s, and in
instances his effects are almost Corotesque. But, then,
every painter who relies on a normal vision and an
unpretentious palette is bound sooner or later to pro-
duce a like result. -Truth is beauty always, and the
implacable veracity of Newbury’s pictures has a
curious charm after several wearying shows wherein
only the performer’s training was aching for expres-
sion. Newbury has no time for “compositions” or
the sun-kissed fancies that libel the clarity of Aus-
tralian daylight. He takes a tree, a bit of road or
a formal evening in the country, and puts it down
with a punctilious regard for tone and proportion
that gives him a faithful likeness of the thing- he
sees. This is Art without humbug or technical glow,
and yet, practised with Newbury’s pertinacious energy,
it has an. ingratiating quality. There are some sub-
jects like “Strathmore Lake, Mt. Maeedon,” and
“Lengthening Shadows” (No. 10), that are calculated
to creep into the affections of the hardest-bitten
veteran of the schools. That local picture-buyers
appreciate the work is revealed by the handsome
sales at prices that, in the cases of “Strathmore
Lake” and some other canvases, undervalue the
artist’s achievement.

In “The Lesson,” at Melbourne Majestic
this week, Constance Talmadge is showing
that Love is not blind, but merely short-
sighted. It is a plain tale of swift marriage
and disillusionment, but Connie’s personal
sparkle brightens the dreariest stretches of
the story. In “Jaques of the Silver North”
Mitchell Lewis gets on happily in the
Canadian backwoods on a modicum of com-
fort and civilisation. But he has a girl to
absorb his attention, and his honorable
regard for the damsel reveals how chivalry
can bloom like a magnolia in the roughest
soil. At Hoyt’s Theda Bara in “What Men
Require” is flooring Prussian officers with
her fatal beauty, and nearly stops Luden-
dorff from losing the war. Theda’s rivals
in fascination this week are Billie Burke
as “The Misleading Widow,” and Peggy
Hyland, who guards a circus cash-box in
“The Merry Go Round.”
Thirteen weeks of “Kissing Time” have
gone by at Melbourne Majesty’s, and
people are still breathlessly waiting for fur-
ther particulars of the episode between
Colonel Bollinger and Lucienne Touquet in
the railway carriage. According to Lucienne
(Maude Fane) she merely behaved like a
sister, whereas the Colonel suggests that
she was a sister of mercy who absent-
mindedly left her pretty head on his chest
Whatever the true facts, the Colonel looks
as if his version might not be far wrong
Indeed, since Arthur Stigant resumed the
job in the train, the warrior looks the irre-
sistible devil whom a modest maiden would
order to the dog-box without the slightest
other provocation.

Notable features in the crowded run of
musical comedy at Adelaide Royal are the
great personal popularity of Frith, the
dancing of Madge Elliott (mostly with
Ritchards or Hooker as partner), and the
steady advance of Grace Lavers. It is
easy to catalogue Grace’s deficiencies, but
she has something of the .attraction, defying
analysis, of old-time Connie Gilchrist.
Countess of Orkney. Willoughby and Marie
Eaton had better chances in “High Jinks’"
at the close; Field Fisher and Greene and
Harry Wotton were always reliable. “On
Our Selection” is coming in at the Tivoli,
with Duggan as Dad. The Majestic has
a good mixed bill, particularly strong at the
moment on the musical side. Pictures are
mostly “intense.” Wondergraph combines
Bill Hart with the gloomy “Woman Thou
Gavest Me” of Hall Caine, which the pub-
lic clearly likes. West’s, where good music
is now a feature by day as well as by
night, has a strong seal-of-the-confessional
drama, “The Victim,” a Catholic Art Asso-
ciation production; also Norma Talmadge
in “The Isle of Conquest,” on that always-
popular theme, a man and a girl on an
island. »
Good concerts have lately been frequent
in Adelaide. Brewster Jones, conductor and
composer, has started Saturday pops with
his orchestra at the Town Hall, and the
public follows him avidly from Sullivan to
Wagner, and thence to “1812.” Maude
Puddy had a Town Hall piano recital, Paul
Howard is giving a whole series of them,
and the Conservatorium responds with con-
certs of various kinds. As a side-line the
old pay-office on North Terrace has opened,
under the management of Eslick. as a
dance “palace.” The first night was given
for the Boy Scout funds, under the most
influential patronage possible. Madge
Elliott came on from the Royal to climb a
ladder at £5 bids from the public for every
rung, and there was a brisk interchange
of streamers and confetti. Adelaide revels
with difficulty, but it gave a fair imitation
of a carnival that night.
Busk-whackers and others who hold £5O

dry sheepskins are warned under various

The tar-boiler leaked badly at the joints, the engine-bed
was cracked in a number of places, and a segment was broken
from the cup wheel. All were saved from the scrap-heap and
made strong as new by Oxy-Acetylene Welding under the
expert supervision of Messrs. Welding and Cutting, Ltd., of
Bathurst Street, Sydney. All joints in the boiler were closed
up, the engine-bed was made strong as new, and a new section
was made and welded into the cup wheel.
An Oxy-Acetylene Welding Outfit proves invaluable to
engineering works, factories, sheet-metal shops, garages, etc.,
wherever metal goods are made or repaired. The perfect
fusion of two metal parts by the powerful Oxy-Acetylene
flame guarantees better, quicker and cheaper repairs than any
other method.
The new COMOX Outfits with Interchangeable Heads
are of special interest to a shop which uses an outfit continu-

“Xorbell”: Allan Wilkie talks of coming
back to Australia in three months, after a
year’s strenuous money-making in Maorilaud.
His latest and most lucrative thriller is
“The Luck of the Navy.”
“Orb”: Most critics thought George Itig-
nold was at his romantically-juvenile best
as William in “Black-eyed Susan,” and
George concurred. William has no other
name in the play, and, acting on this, Clifton
Alderson decided to give Rignold a jolt one
night. Alderson was the presiding admiral
in the court-martial scene. “Wlmt’s your
name?” he demanded. “William, sir,” an-
swered Rignold, according to script. “Yes,
yes !” retorted the admiral unexpectedly, “but
what’s your other name? You must be Wil-
liam Somebody?” Rignold’s eye glittered
as he answered, quietly, “William Anson.”
But he had more than that to say to the
improvising admiral when he came off.

“0.K.”: The preposterous chuck-and-
smash melodramietta that John Lawson
brought from England with him was not
always the poor business proposition it has
looked at Melbourne Princess’s. Twenty
years ago, when Lawson was young and
active, he used to put “Humanity” through
for all it was worth as a sensational piece
of destruction. When the stage Jew and
Gentile started to throw things at one an-
other they were almost as sure of their
moves as a couple of expert jugglers "feed-
ing" one another with clubs. Also they were
quick about it. It then seemed to be by
accident rather than design that the Gentile
was in front of a mirror when the infuriated
Hebrew hurled a lamp at his head, which
the Gentile adroitly ducked —and so forth.
Their respective chucks had all the appear-
ance of being intended to do a mischief to
the man, whereas in the slow and labored
interchange of throws at the Princess’s every-
body could perceive that the deadly foes
were trying to do all possible damage to the
glassware .while carefully avoiding any dam-
age to themselves. The deliberateness of
their performance was pathetic to anyone
who had formerly seen Lawson, in the same
absurd playlet, get an audience ns excited
as though the entertainment was a rousing
give-and-take scrap with the gloves.
“Harrison 0.”: On the programme at Mel-
bourne King’s “Tiger Rose” is described as
the “Great Belasco Play,” and in smaller
type it is men-
tioned that the
mere author was
Willard Mack. By
what process does
Mack’s brain-child
become the off-
spring of the

forth as the gifted managements that “pre-
sent” their plays, and the still more gifted
people who have the brain-racking job of
ordering the canvas and carpets for their
original production.
“Hamfat”: Polite vaudeville becomes very
polite with a parson on the boards.
The effect of Frank Gorman upon the rest of
the programme is noticeable at Fuller’s
show: the rich-colored gags that will obtrude
in the best-managed variety entertainments
have hidden themselves out of sight of the
sky-pilot entertainer. Is it that the other
performers are reluctant to shock the parson ?
Or is there a managerial anticipation that
the billing of the clergyman will attract
churchy people, not usually attendants at
’alls, who may become regular patrons? Any-
way, the show doesn’t suffer from the absence
of hot stuff.
“J.F.H.”: There is a movement to still
further increase prices of admission in
London. In some places stalls have already
been advanced from 10s. 6d. to 12s. Gd.
and dress-circle seats from 7s. 6d. to 9s.
Managers declare that under present condi-
tions they must play to 90 p'.c. of their
capacity every night of the week to pay cur-
rent expenses. The new standard contract
for actors and actresses and the revised rates
of pay for stage-hands have intensified the
difficulty. Provincial tours, which formerly
compensated for London losses, have also
been hard hit by difficulties of locomotion and
high rates and charges everywhere.
“Old Pot”: John F. Sheridan (the Widow
O’Brien) met John Daly, the A.J.C. handi-
capper. “Hullo,” said Johnny, “still stopping
horses from winning?” It appealed to John
as a neat definition of his job. Sheridan’s
first co., which appeared here in the middle
’eighties, was his best. It included the
inimitable Bella (May Livingstone), Dun-
bar, and the man with the enormous mous-
tache, James A. Meade. Meade was an actor
of parts, for he later played Dr. Ceneri in
George Rignold’s “Called Back,” and he was
the priest in George Darrell’s “Soggarth.”
Meade, in the latter, had to sacrifice his
wonderful mo., although he pleaded hard to
be allowed to soap it down. That was the
practice adopted by Alfred Dampier and so
well was it done that the presence of hair
could not be detected. G. S. Titheradge was
another who declined to remove his mo. until
the old firm of Williamson, Garner and Mus-
grove virtually shaved him. He had stuck
to the hair to hide that twist of the mouth
which subsequently proved a gold-mine to
him in comedy parts.
“0.K.”: “8.1. D.” (B. 15/4/'2O) com-
plains that Harry Iv. Eustace’s lecture on
African jungle life is poor entertainment
compared with his pictures, and that “his
puns are wearying.” This comes of expect-
ing a notable explorer and hunter to be a
brilliant raconteur. Had the complainant
any recollections of H. M. Stanley he would
have regarded Eustace as a measure of com-
pensation for the lecturer whom the late
li. S. Smythe put on the platform long be-
fore moving pictures were dreamed of. The
Yankee lecturer bored us to death. Eus-
tace is more or less interesting from the time
he gets going in the jungle, and many of
his pictures, although poor as . specimens of.
up-to-date photography, are thrilling sug-
gestions of the photographer's hunting
exploits. As for his wearying puns (there
are only two or three of them), he excuses
them on the assumption that they serve as
comic relief in an instructive discourse,
which is perhaps a too-flattering view to
take of the feeble jests.
“Fax”: Who says that all the situations
in “Tilly of Bloomsbury” are painful? Why.
in the situations at the end of the Ist and
3rd acts human nature is idealised. Connie,
championing Tilly “because she likes her,”
is a vision of sweet girl-character—a beauti-
fully incredible example of uncattishness.
Connie and Dickey have been great pals,
and Dickey’s mother is bent on making them
man and wife; nevertheless when the boy
introduces ineligible Tilly into the paternal
mansion as the little girl of his heart, Connie
at once warms to the stranger, and finds
delight in making her look pretty. Not a
suspicion of jealousy, spite or injured vanity
about Connie! She’s just about the sweetest
story ever told —with an emphasis on the
“story.” And the devotion of Dickey to
Tilly! Cynicism shakes its head, but remains
respectfully silent in the presence of this
gentle, matter-of-fact presentation of love’s
young dream. If the scenes between the
love-struck pair were not truly poetical, in
spite of their uncongenial surroundings, the
acting of Frank Freeman and Dorothy Man-
ville couldn’t be so near perfection.
“Old Pot”: “Plain Bill” Holloway, like
Premier John Storey, was a boilermaker.
Brother Charlie was a “snob,” as a boot-
maker was usually called in the early days.
“Bill” was the greater actor: he once stepped
into Irving’s shoes.
“P.”: “T. 0.1.” (B. 8/4/'2O), challeng-
ing “Hugh Stone’s” memory re Maggie
Moore’s first Sydney appearance, says:
“There was not a vestige of a tombstone left
in the George-street cemetery in 1870.” Well,
another Old Inhabitant declares that in 1870
he played cricket in the cemetery, using for
wicket a tombstone, of which several were
pile< against the fence. Presumably these
were stones left stranded after the coffins
had been removed.
“T. 0.1.”: Dolly Green, the Dolores Drum-
mond of “J.F.H.” (B. 22/4/’2O), was born
Feb. 3, 1838, and has, therefore, turned into
her 83rd year. I saw Dolly in the late ’fifties
as member of a co. at the old Princess’s, Mel-
bourne, supporting Mary Provost in “Cam-
ille” and other plays. Her first appearance
as an actress is said to have been at the old
“Iron Pot,” in Lonsdale-street, in 1856; and
once, ’tis said, she appeared as Desdemona
to the Othello of G. V. Brooke. Her dramatic
home in my young days was the old Prin-
cess’s. Her husband was a law clerk seldom
seen near the theatre. Some years ago she
returned to Australia with a monologue,
but it did not catch on. Though perhaps
the oldest she is not the last living actress
of the G. Y. Brooke era. Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis (Rose Edouin) is also in London;
Mrs. L. L. Lewis (Rosa Dunn) is in Paris;
Mrs. Arrowsmith Ryan (mother-in-law of
Randolph Bedford, widow of William Ryan,
a heavy man who frequently understudied
Brooke) is in Australia. Mrs. Ryan appeared
on the stage as Miss Montrose.
“Widower II.” : Isn’t “M. 8.” rather over-
doing it when he speaks (B. 15/4/’2O) of
Theodore Leonard being a London star? The
matter is not of Imperial importance, but
with a fairly comprehensive knowledge of
the West End stage for the last 20 years
I can’t recall the comedian’s name being ele-
vated to stellar rank, and I would like to
know when and where it happened. Certainly
it didn’t happen in the “Merry Widow,” in
which “M. 8.” remembers Leonard playing
with Lily Elsie. Lily was, of course, the
star of that Daly’s' show, and Joseph Coyne
and Georae Graves were the minor constella-
tions. Where did Theodore come in?
“Chev”: Died recently, within a few days
of each other, the gifted and genial Irish-
man, Dr. Houston Collisson, and Percy
French, his lifelong friend and musical colla-
borator. Their best-known work was the
very popular “Mountains of Mourne.” Dr.
Collisson was in harness to the last; on the
evening before he died he eove a concert at
Hawarden to discharged soldiers.
“E.T.” : Apropos Seymour Hicks and hi«
singing of “Her Golden Hair Was Hang-
ing,” etc., mentioned by “C. Qekney” (B.
22/4/’2O), the volatile mummer tells a yarn
in his autobiography published a decade ago.
“The Sleeping
Beauty," at Sydney
Criterion.
Mrs. Spoopendke
(Marriott Edgar)
recites “ Pussy’s
Xmas.”
One Monday night
at the Gaiety ("on
a Monday the
show ladies always
talked more than
on any other night
in the week”) one
lovely lady who
was an incorrigible
chatterer “was re-
lating some experi-
ences so loudly
as I sang that she
knocked all the
words out of my
head. I deter-
mined to give her
a lesson, so said to
Ivan Caryll (who
was conducting),
‘One moment.’ and
the band stopped
suddenly. I turned
to her of the wag-
ging tongue and
said, ‘Dear lady,
will you finish
your story or shall
I finish my songV’
Not in the least
taken aback, she
stepped down to
my side and said.
‘Do you know,
dearie, it’s a mat-
ter of the utmost
indifference to me
what you do.’ ” The little scene went bet-
ter with the audience than any gag that
Hicks ever annexed.
“T. D. Emdee”: The experiment of the
local panto did not end with “Matsa” in
1897. A year or two later Bernard Espi-
nasse, the “house”-author for the Firm, wrote
“Australis.” Although this was not the suc-
cess of either “Djiu Djin” or “Matsa,” it
had quite a decent run. In it Espinasse pre-
dicted wireless telephony and commercial
aviation. It suffered from the lack of
comedy, this being Espinasse’s weak point.
Nearly all his work was set in a minor key
the man himself being neurasthenic. He
needed silence, and did his writing while
others slept.
“C. Ockney”: London Gaiety wanted Con-
nie Ediss for her old part in “The Shop
Girl,” but Connie wasn’t anxious to cross
over from the Criterion, where she has a
congenial role in “Lord Richard in the
I'antry” with Cyril Maude. So the chance
fell to May Beatty, the comely M.L. girl
who started with the Pollards, and, after a
few years on Australian boards, went to
England. She married Teddy Lauri, also
well remembered here ; and the two ap-
peared in various musical plays together.
She was left a widow a couple of years ago.
“Ancient Prompter”: “Old Pot’s” inquiry
(B. 15/4/’2O) reminds me that there was a
well-known mummer in England in the
’eighties named J. (otherwise “Jack”)
Rosier. He may have paid Australia a visit,
orobably with Marie de Grey or some such
lady star. I admit that that would hardly
account for “Joseph Rosier” or “J. Rosier”
being of general use as a “till-up” for a
“double” in various local day-bills. Still,
it’s a coincidence, and probably the custom
arose through the individual in question not
putting in an appearance when his name was
in the bill. I remember that happening on
more than one occasion. Theatrical cus-
toms die hard. Old members of F. R. Ben-
son’s company, from Oscar Asche down, will
tell you of a performer whose name has
appeared on countless Shakspearean pro-
grammes but has never been seen in the
flesh. He (or it) is “Mr. Walter Plinge.’ -
who has frequently been down to play
“doubles” in various Bensonian productions
on the same evening at theatres hundreds
of miles apart. I think it will be found
that Plinge was a member; of Asche’s crowd
when he toured Australia. He would be
still on Benson’s bills in England at the
same time.
“Bell” : “Harrison O.” will be getting him;
self disliked if lie calls the “Tiger Rose”
noise-makers “supers” (B. 15/4/’2O). The
making of stage noise “effects” is the duty
of the property-man and his myrmidons, who
belong to another union, and rather look
down on supers and other mere actors.
“Orb”: Gus Neville, referred to recently
as the long-distance hero who kept on being
virtuous in a different bellowdrama each
week for four years, has a clever girl.
Dorothy, dancing in the J.C.W. panto at
Sydney Criterion.
“Cheese” (London) : Saw Rosina Buck-
man the other night. You would not know
her. She is now a great singer—the greatest
Australasia has ever produced. Take three
of the fattest soprani you ever saw play Car-
men, add them together, and multiply by five,
and you will have some idea of the buxom
Buckman.
THE DOORKEEPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Deceased was doorkeeper at two local theatres
for over 30 years.” —From a recent obituary.
I am the keeper of the door,
The Peter at his gate below ;
I block the deadheads sternly or
Admit the chosen to the show.
I've seen these actor fellows come,
And strut the boards and smirk and bob,
And disappear, and I am dumb,
About my gifts the bill is mum,
But, as you see, I hold my job.
They’re all alike upon the stage;
Alike they posture and they blow, -
And have their bursts of joy and rage.
I’ve seen enough, I ought to know.
If you, like me, for thirty years
Of art an awful surfeit had,
You’d wonder how one ever cares
To come in here of nights. It bears
My tenet out —we all are mad.
The actors bring the people in;
It’s half my game to keep them out.
I can’t expect great fame to win—
The press won’t put my name about -
But, all the same, my part I play,
And, disregarded, do not fret.
The people throw me no bouquet.
But there are compensations—they
Have thrown no turnips either yet!
VICTORIA.
STARGAZER.

Apparently the demand of the Common-
wealth Taxation Commissioner for a percentage from
the tote on the ground that it is a lottery was just
a long shot —if that Sort of thing comes off once im
20 times the Department gains, though it is doubtful
whether Federation does. The tax would have just about
killed the tote unless the bookmaker was abolished.
But the latter reform would have to be carried
out in a serious spirit. At present in N. S. Wales,
and especially in Sydney, sly betting-shops are com-
moner than sly grog-shops in a prohibition country.
Many are in the heart of the city, and everyone with
any knowledge of its life knows them and their
tie-diamonded proprietors. If Ike were abolished on
all raceconses, and if at the same time the police
raided the big betting-shops with anything like the
enthusiasm they display in the case of two-up and
fan-tan v aools, that section of the community which
must gamble would be driven to patronise the tote
at any price. Some advantages that will immediately
occur to most people are: (1) a number of able-
bodied citizens would be freed to engage in productive
work ; (2) some would stop betting, being unable to
go racing or to find trustworthy commission-workers :
(2) the Federal revenue would be vastly swelled,
and by those who are in the best position to swell
it. The people who control the race-clubs could
in conjunction with the Government bring about
this desirable change in a very few days if they
wished. There is certainly no better method of
helping the tote.
* ♦ * #
Adelaide racing is very clean, so a
■sensation has been caused by the wiping-out for a
year of C. A. Northway (trainer) and H. Redden
(jockey) oyer the running of Yoopina at a Tatter-
sail’s meeting. She is an inconsistent mare, and
local sporting writers agree that the action is
harsh—unless the stipes (Hogan. Clem Hill and Tom
Wigley) know more than the public; and they
shouldn’t. Still, there has been no appeal.
Vincent Zed. Adelaide's wealthy unknown
who bought all contractor Timms’s big string of
racehorses, just for the sake of a new sensation,
nearly a year ago, bad the poorest luck with them,
winning only two events, both on the Port course.
The other day things swung round, and, on the same
track, he took three races in one day. One of them
went to Green Cap (imp.), which landed the
Adelaide Cup for Timms in 1917, had won nothing
since, and is now talked about for the coming meet-
ings, with only Bst. lib. in the Cup close at hand.
He had fist. 51b. when he won. Zed now talks of
going in for breeding- on a generous scale.
South Aus. thinks it has an uncom-
mon two-year-old in Hesso, and now begins to
wonder whether Earl Simon is not as good. This
colt, which has already been seen on Melbourne
tracks, lately carried lOst. at Port Adelaide, and
beat Avery (late of Sydney) easily. He should
meet Hesso in the S. A. Stakes at Morphettville in
May. Sydney Kidman bred Turn (Sir Simon —Four-
some).
* * *
Sydney Page, one of the Speck's oldest
racing identities, passed the post in Hobart on April
22. Veai’s ago he bred some of the Island's best
racers —Music, The Queen and others —and ran
horses for a time in co. with the late Charles Agnew.
After giving up ownership he became starter for the
Tas. Racing Club, and held the job almost as long
as anybody can remember. His brother Alf (the
Jt.L.C.) was handicapper for the same club until
Anno Domini beckoned him a few years ago.
“Old Sport”: John Storey was concerned
about the Federal tote tax, but it would have hit the
public and the race clubs harder than the Treasury
ol' X. S. Wales. Nominally 11 per cent, is deduct ed
front tote investments; actually it is more, as the
fractions mean another 2 per cent. The non-pro-
prietary clubs grab them, but in the case of the
proprietary bodies the amount goes to the Treasurer.
The pony clubs protect their patrons better than the
registered proprietary cos., as they pay 3d. in a
dividend, while the A.-T.C. and kindred bodies pay
nothing less than fid. The Queensland totes pay out
the lot. The Canterbury Park dub, smarting be-
cause of the Treasury grab, let the cat out of the
bag. It was shown that in a turn-over of
£(16.210 10s. the Government received £llO6
12s. lOd. in fractions. Boiled down the Treasury’s
share of the loot was £5835, while the dub, after
paying all expenses, including interest on the cost
of buildings, got £348.
* * * *
Abbeville, who won the second division
of the Trial Stakes at Pt. Adelaide and paid the
nice little dividend of £7l 17s. for a pound, was
bred and is owned by Alby Rankin, of the S.A. South-
east. He is a Digger, and named his horse on
account of the good time he and his cobbers had
at Abbeville. Most of the £l7 10s. placed in the
tote on the horse came from soldiers. A few days
before the race Rankin married a daughter of
Albion Tolley, so the stake comes as a handy little
wedding present.

At the recent Port Adelaide meeting the
first and third places in the Paddington Handicap
were filled by Green Cap and Prince Bardolph, who
ran second and first in the Sydney Cup of 1916, a
year when “class” was wanting in the field. Tliut
same Port meeting was a lovely advt. for the tote
on its own, not the machine in unfair competition
with bawling bookies. Listen to the results of a

“Trot”: The yaru about Artilleryman
having gone stale doesn’t
impress me. He didn’t
look like a stale horse at
Randwick the other day
nor run like one. And, in
any case, when did the
staleness begin ? Before
he was beaten by Millieme
or after the Cup ? When he
went out in the Leger the
stable was so unconvinced
of his staleness that it
laid long odds on him.
Two days later it backed
him so heavily in the Cup
that he went from 20’s to
o’s in a few hours. And
his staleness was so hidden
from the people he lives
with that on the third day
they wouldn’t believe it
was possible for him to
miss the all-aged stakes.
Artilleryman had not done
an excessive amount of
racing. Far from it.
Compared with Sydney
Damsel and Mt. Frisco,
which finished first and
third in the Doncaster, lie
has been resting.
CHAS. B. KELLOW.
Tic. racehorse-owner
and good sport.
I. arramatta : Consider the variegated
career of Kybas, Tasmania’s Arsenal gelding, now
hoary with age! For years he ran among- the un-
registered brigade as Kalnuck, and accounted for
over 20 races, all distances, under heavv welter
weights, flat and hurdles. When not on the track
he was odd-jobbing in the plough or the wood- and
water-cart at Avoca, where the son of Goldsbrough
sired, him. Another little specialty of his was
running tandem up the mountain "slopes of Ben
Lomond and returning, in the lead, the driver dis-
pensing with the reins! He was picked up a few
months since by returned-soldier Woods at about the
value of the given-in racing gear. Entering the
registered forces, and worked by the new owner over
the timber, he has become a real pay streak. In
six starts he has only once been out of place money.
He led off with a win; his next was a dead heat—
the jockey dropped the whip just when one tickle
was wanted from it. Then, at Hobart, over a short
jumping course, and only half-ready (he was recover-
ing from a cold), he took second money to a good
one in Bellenza. His next run was in the jumpers’
Hat at Mowbray. The distance (ljm.) was much
too short—which sounds quaint in these days of
five- and six-furlong flutters. Then on Easter Mon-
day he fairly bounded in for Tassy’s big money,
the 3 J-mile Steeplechase, at Deloraine, in record
time for the course. To prove it was no fluke he
saddled up next day in the Meander Steeple and
bossed his field over a shorter distance, coming home
alone, with his teeth exposed—grinning and enjoy-
ing it. Future plans are said to include the big
Flemington jumps; but I would like him younger
for this job. Still, should he cross the straits, Mel-
bourne will see something choice in the-air which
will recall Lizette and some of the other old-timers
who made the hard-doing regulars draw the wind
through their lips at the length of take-off. I am
not out tipping a winner, but I’ll chance this: if
the old grey great-grandson of Kelpie lands in his
recent trim, any horse ahead of him at the finish
of the voyage will be tearing up the record tor the
last mile, if not for the full distance.
From a report of a Tasmanian race meet-
ing on Easter Monday:—
“At the far turn the mare was well ahead, and
before the straight was reached was out half a
dozen lengths. In the run home she slackened her
pace in a remarkable manner, and was beaten by
a head.”
In these cases it is not so much the jockey who is
caught napping as the stewards who are caught
winking.

While Amythas is said to have no peer at
w.f.a. in M.L. over two miles, Arrowsmith is con-
sidered to be unrivalled over half that distance.
The two met in the Awapuni Gold Cup (lj mile,
w.f.a.) at Palmerston North, and the Demosthenes
gelding was all out to win from the imported son
of Chaucer; Vagabond third. Gloaming, who is
now himself again, would make matters exciting
for all three over a mile and a half.

Sydney Damsel’s half-brother, The Whalan,
won a Third Division Handicap at Albion Park
(Q.) on Saturday, being followed home by the
unlucky Maori Lady. The Purse was a contest
between the short-priced favorite John Syce and
Major Shannon; the latter went down though in
receipt of 181 b. Buranda took the Plate, the con-
sistent Sir Cyrus never getting an opening.
The Cardinal Beaufort gelding Bed Car-
dinal had an easy win, at a short price, in the
Autumn Handicap at Newcastle (N.S.W.) on Satur-
day. Posiastre, the second choice, ran a bad last:
lie usually finishes there or thereabouts when most
fancied. The crack C'oalopolis jockey, Mahoney,
was on three winners at the meeting.
Mabu, who holds the two-mile hurdle
record, was unlucky to lose the Khartoum Hurdle
at the V.A.T.C. meeting on Saturday. Reid fell
off when all seemed over bar collecting.
Arthur Bishop, flyweight champion of
Wales, took the knock at Sydney Stadium on Satur-
day night. The tragedy befel in the 17th round,
and the agent of destruction was the rapidly-
improving Jerry Sullivan. Arthur is a tall, thin
hoy (no longer a flyweight, by the wav: lie tipped
the beam for the contest at Bst. 311 b.), who appears
to have been taught well and to have then for-
gotten most of his lessons. Many of his right
swings were so w ;, d that they moved a not-ungenerous
crowd to ribak. mirth. Sullivan—a couple of
pounds heavier and about half a foot shorter—
bored in from the jump and gave the visitor no
peace. The Australian was winning on points by
several miles when Bishop left himself open. Sulli-
van promptly crossed to the jaw and the display
concluded.

“O. Blin’’: It had gouc six rounds, and
Dynamite Smith was still warily attempting to do
mischief to his adversary. Betino Briggs was equally
cautious—it really seemed a contest in mutual
evasiveness—and the chances of seeing any real
damage done faded with every clap of the gong.
The crowd, derisively blasphemous at first, event-
ually grew silent for the want of further ammunition;
hut at the end of the eighth section a youth advanced
to tlie ropes and brought the synod to a finish.
“’Ere.” he said, handing each a cow bell, “’ang
these round yer necks in case yer lose one ernuther.”
There was an unusual finish to a
recent fight at Port Pirie (S.A.) between the light-
weight pets of that place and neighboring Port
Augusta, Zubrinich and Dienhoff. It was a willing go,
and /üb. showed clever foot-work ; hut during some
fierce exchanges in the sixth round he overdid it,
stepping back into the ropes and slipping right
through them. He landed with one foot on the
floor of the hall and one still on the ring-side, and
he was strained as to have to give up the fight.
The total destruction by fire last week of
the Rose Ray (Sydney) Golf Club building merely
anticipated a job which the house-breakers were to
have effected in a few years’ time. The member-
ship list, and the standard of comfort, not to say
luxury, of the members had long outgrown the
wooden shack which was considered palatial 10
years ago. The committee proposes now to spend
£50,000 on an edifice which should be the finest
thing in its line in Australia. But in the year or
more of its building, regular patrons will be in
a bad way for accommodation. The flames had
hardly got hold of the roof before all rents of suit-
able club premises in and around Rose Bay went
up 50 per cent.

S. A. Football League seems determined
to have a lawyer in its chair. J. R. Anderson,
K. 0., ruled till his death; then Cleland, K.C., came
and lately retired on account of pressure of busi-
ness. Now O. C. Kingston’s last partner, A. J.
McLachlan (who is due for the next K.C.), has
taken the job, and he has the determined character
necessary to make a success of it

A section of Sydney Uni. has entered for
N. S. Wales Rugby League premiership, and on
Saturday three teams turned out for practice matches.
Queensland Uni. has also thrown in its lot with the
League, and favors inter-State ’Varsity matches .under
the XIII code. Tears ago N. S. Wales Sporting
Federation decided that amateurs playing Rugby
League forfeited their status; but since then M.L.
amateurism has permitted George Davidson (who
will probably trip to the Olympic Games) to plav
League, and the Australasian A.A.A. has accepted
his entry in the championships.

The A.I.F. athletes lost to The Best by
225 to 31 j points at Sydney on Saturday. The
honors, however, were with the Diggers: out of
nine events they were first in five. The balance was
made up in placings. The best performers w*ere
W. H. Hutton (A.1.F.), first in 440yds. (55sec.) and
880yds. (2min. 9sec.) and third in 100yds.; and
Winter (A.1.F.), first in hop, step and jump
(461 t. 11m.), second in high jump (sft. 4in.), and
third in broad jump (20ft. 94in.). In the broad
jump “Slip” Carr (A.1.F.) put up a great leap of
21ft. 7|iri., thereby defeating Australian champion
R. .T. Honnor (Rest). On behalf of The Rest,
sprinter W. W. Hunt had an easy victory in the
100yds. (10 l-ssee.), K. B. Fraser wasn’t extended
in the 120yds. hurdles (17sec.). and O. Nothling’s
javelin throw (145 ft. 71in.) was 26ft. l(Hin. ahead
of the next competitor. N. S. Wales A.A.A. saw the
programme through.
T. S. Hewitt, who will represent Aus-
tralia in the Marathon at Antwerp, ran 20 miles m
2h. llmin. 3sec. at Melbourne last week. Marathon
conditions were observed. It was 2min.

1908.

The inter-collegiate sports in Adelaide
were a good thing this year for St. Peter’s, 72
points to Prince Alfred’s 39. And this, although
the one outstanding Saint, Cocks, supposed to have
hurdles, steeple and both jumps in his pocket, re-
vived an old knee trouble when winning the hurdle*,
and was not r- 'e to compete further. Gray won
both long jump and steeple for Prince’s; and these
were the only two senior events which that side
did win. Chief interest centred in the Old Bovs’
events. The quarter was won by C. E. Pellew, the
A.I.F. cricketer, but his younger brother, L.Y.,
took the hundred and hurdles.

Vic. senior cadet championship sports meet
ing came off at Melbourne Cricket Ground last Satur-
day afternoon, in conjunction with the presentation
of 1914-10 stars to the Anzacs. It proved, inter
alia, that the training areas which contain tin
public schools have all the pull. Every individual
win went to Wesley, Scotch, Grammar or Xavier:
while in the tug-of-war the area taking in Scotch
College simply walked away from the rest. B. t .
Melville (Scotch) got the decision from K. F. Nor-
man (Wesley) by inches in the 100yds.: he cut
it out in 10 3-ssec. R. L. Almond (Scotch) hit the
tape in the 120yds. hurdles (time 161 sec.), while the
second man was negotiating the last jump. K. F.
Norman won the 220yds. by a street. In the mile
walk 25 faced the starter and provided one of the
“goes” of the day. E. Gault (Wesley) beat E. Don-
nelly to the tape by inches. Time, Sinin. lOlsee.
The mile saw G. Anderson, a youngster who "runs
with one of the harrier clubs, record 4min. 571 sec.,
with a bare yard to spare from .T. K. O’Driscoll," who
made an impression at a recent combined Christian
Bros.’ colleges sports. The race produced the
star finish of the meeting-, the list lap being fought
out all the way. Every battalion in the State sent
reps., though it must have- discouraged some of the
youngsters to find themselves up against such cracks
as Almond (hurdles and broad jump), Duigan (high
jump), and the sprinters from the big schools.

Wests, last season’s runners-up in Sydney
grade cricket, went, one better this year. On the
other hand, Paddington have fallen from top of the
list to sixth, where they lie side by side with Peter-
sham and Waverley. Central Cumberland had no
difficulty in retaining the position they held in
1918-19: dead last.
Uni. were wholly unable to score the outright win
over Wests which alone would have robbed the latter
of the Premiership. Their batsmen were held up
badly by Dive—-who was given his chance after the
others had failed—and it was by painfully-slow
cricket that the side scraped together 185 —79
runs worse than the enemy effort. Rock did best
for the students: his 86 was full of merit, albeit
made rather crudely. West’s fielding was as keen
as ’Varsity’s, which is high praise.
A. Punch (North Sydney) led the batting averages
with 63.61 for 827 runs. He also topped the score
in 1917-18 with 750, averaging 57.69. A long way
behind Warren Bardsley’s 1145 averaging 104.09
(1918-19) and “Sunny Jim” Mackay’-s 1041 averaging
104.10 (1905*6). O. Asher (Sydney) took most
wickets (63), with E. Trenerry (Uni.) next (61).
C. G. Macartney (Gordon) —who only played half
the season—had the. best figures (46 at 10.41), with
C. lielleway (43 at 12.35) next in order. “Bosey”
Mailey’s 102 at 14.04 (1915-16) are the best figures
on the book.

Harry Musgrove, recalling liis century
against an English cricket team (B. 15/4/’2O).
mentions that it was the first 100 made against
England by an Australian in Australia “at the
first time of asking.” Other Australian bats had
reached three figures in earlier battles with J.
Bull, but Henry was the first to do it in his
initial encounter with John.
Owing to increased steamer fares and
heavier hotel and other charges, the Marvlebone
Cricket Club will demand a bigger guarantee for the
team it talks of sending to Australia in two or three
months. This means enlarged prices of admission,
and the Australian Board of Control is considering
the prospects with some misgiving, as the expected
appearance of practically unknown names among the
Englishmen will vastly affect the team’s drawing
power. Another trouble that is looming is the choice
of a skipper for the Australian side. Armstrong's
chances are not rosy, and it is quite likelv that the
post will be offered to Collins, late of the A.I.F.
The A.I.F. cricketers tip Spooner of Lancashire to
lead the English Eleven if it comes.
Maorilaud sculling champion Hadfield
easily won the Petone Challenge Cup in choppv
water at Wellington the other day. His splendid
watermanship pulled him through. Hadfield, who
defeated Felton for the Diggers’ championship in
France, is booked for the Olympic Games.
Sydney pennant bowls (metropolitan sec-
tion) semi-finals ended on Saturday, when Ashfield
defeated Waverley by 98 —91 and Mosman over-
whelmed Burwood by 113—100. B. Smith (Mos-
man) made the noise of the afternoon by a great
rink win of 41-22. In the final Ashfield demolished
Mosman at Randwick by 124-72.

“Forward”: If an English soccer team
comes to Australia in the winter as an outcome
of the present negotiations, the play will be an
eye-opener. _ The dribbling game is sensational in
England this season, and enormous gates are being
recorded in the three principal League series and in
the cup ties. For the final, to be played at Chelsea
this time, owing to military objections to Crvsta)
Palace, the admission has been fixed at from' 3s.
to 21s. The attendance is to be limited to 90,000
iot safety and comfort.
BE A SPORT!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“If Mr. George Fuller goes on much longer with
these rather cumbrous and certainly unsportsman-
like sneers and fleers against the new Government,
lie will help to discredit not the new Government,
but his own party. The public of New South Wales
is, amongst other qualities, a sporting public. It
recognises that Mr. George Fuller’s tactics are not
sporting, and that the game he is playing is not
cricket.”—Sun'.
Do not nag at Mr. Storey ;
Do not criticise or chide.
Do not level insults hoary
That would penetrate the hide
Of a rhino, or a hippo.,
Or an importuning Gyppo.
Play the game.
Do not blame
In a carping, captious fashion;
Or display unseemly passion.
Rather help him, in a manly and self-sacrificing way,
To retain the job from which he flung you out the
other day.
When the press inquires your notion
Of his efforts up to date,
Make no mannerless commotion ;
Show no crude and boorish hate.
Answer brightly: “Boys, by thunder,
As a statesman lie’s a wonder!
If he goes
Heaven knows
What the State will do withoqt him.”
If you sneer at him, or flout him,
Or endeavor to discredit him in anybody’s eyes,
\ on will cause the ire of ev’ry decent local sport to
ri e.
And when scandals start arriving,
As they're bound in time to do,
And his enemies are striving
To down him as he did you,
Stand forth fearlessly beside him
And to those who would deride him
Loudly cry:
“It’s a lie!
Cease to talk such rot unvarnished:
Storey’s honor is untarnished.”
Some may say your mental issue is conspicuously
short;
On the other hand, his friends will all agree that
you’re a sport.

Official preparations for the visit are on
a very much more limited scale than those
of 19 years ago when the Prince’s pa and
ma were coming. T. G. Watson, then
Assistant-Clerk of the Assembly, had a big
staff working night and day; and the
whiskered Jenkins had another contingent
of clerks running a separate show for the
Commonwealth. This time Sam Whitehead
seems to be the only State man doing any-
thing. General White, who is managing
things for the Commonwealth, has a small
staff at Vic. Barracks; and there are also
a press committee to advise on certain mat-
ters, and a group of citizens to arrange for
treats for the sailormen on the Renown and
Australian warships. Meantime the dailies
are working overtime to pump up enthusi-
asm. They are probably doing more harm
than good to the cause which brings the
heir to the Throne this way. Still they
needn’t worry about the visit being a “popu-
lar” frost. The crowds will turn up all
right.
There has been a deafening fuss about
the printing of programmes, proclamations,
menus, etc., to do with the visit of the
Prince. For the motto on the crest of the
Prince of Wales the Hunnish “Ich Dien”
had been printed, and then somebody said
it should have been the English “I -serve.”
The G.-G., away in Sydney, lost sleep over
the matter. Telegrams flashed across the
map, and cables flickered to England. Print-
ing troubles and the cost of Bristol board
were beginning to make the matter serious,
when word came from headquarters that,
though the family’s name had been altered
in proper form from Wettin to Windsor, the
Prince’s motto remained the same old
Hun —though, of course, there is always the
handy explanation that it is merely a German
corruption of something Welsh. Which is
highly probable. For the more loyal some
British people professed to be the more
they favored the foreigner, whether in art,
commerce or society.
The little debs, are in an awful flurry
about the Mayoral Ball. They have a prac-
tice set moving and cannot get definite
information about the big revel. If the
Mayoral Ball falls through, can they find
another opening through which to deb.?
Federal Parliament House is to be illumi-
nated in a new way for the Prineelet’s visit.
Electric lights, backed by reflectors, will
be set un in bunches in the gardens on each
side and on roofs opposite, whilst others will
he attached to the ornamental lamp-posts in
front of the House. Thus will the building
be bathed in silver and made like a palace
in a pantomime. Apart from its effect, it
is alleged that the new system has the virtue
of economy compared with the old fashion of
picking out the building’s contours with
hundreds of small lamps.
The ball for the Women’s Hospital is
definitely pinned down to May 31. The
Prince is to dance, and the tickets range
from two guineas a seat for mere lookers-
on in the balcony to five guineas for a bit
of dancing-floor space and a chance to bump
the young man in a jazz.
The Hobart banqueters whisper that a
Melbourne caterer is to be imported for their
Ministerial dinner to the Prince. The
Speck always regards Melbourne as a sort
of Paris.
On the Thursday of his Melbourne visit
the Prince will be wheeled away from the
masses to the powdered bosom of Toorak.
The sheep kings will feed H.R.H. at the Mel-
bourne Club before he is convoyed to the St.
Kilda Town Hall to jazz with the 82 matrons.
One wearily wonders if Mrs. and Miss Toorak
will strike young Edward as being more pat-
rician than the guests at the civic party.
Probably not. The vice-regal Fergusons will
hostess two shows. People are burning to
know how they are to be graded socially.
Where are those vast democratic assemblies
the young visitor asked for? If he is here
to strengthen the silken bonds the organisers
of these receptions are rather queering the
young man’s wicket.
The estimable Captain H. H. Share has
brought a knighthood into the Bridges
family. He married a daughter of the
late Admiral when he was a Government
House private sec., on leave from the
Navy. He was with Jellicoe on the post-
war naval tour, and that was the last lap
in the effort which won him the K.B E.
No enthusiasm has been shown up to the
present regarding the proposal to establish
a national memorial to Alfred Deakin, who
was broken on the wheel of public service.
Premier Lawson has had a talk with George
Moir, chief president of the A.N.A., and
with other public men, and all that is known
is that the matter has been deferred for the
present.
Deniliquin cut out its annual picnic race-
meeting during the war, but made up for
the break this April. Melbourne packed its
best frocks and hurried to Deniliquin and
the homesteads about until the hens started
to roost early in order to make sure of
their sleeping quarters. There were club
luncheons and teas at the races, and the
usual welter of dinner dances among the
house-parties. Deniliquin forgot the
drought and put up a pink silk marquee for
the Race Club Ball. Then the Clive Fairbairns
borrowed the pink silk shed for their dance
on one night, and the Hunter Pattersons
booked it for another. The Hoskings
joined in by lending their garden for the
staging of the ballroom. Joyce Landale,
a Hosking niece, made a treble debut
—she was at the three dances. The Leigh
Falkiners had a house-party. Edna Army-
tage and some Baillieux and Fairbairns
bundled in there. Mrs. Hunter Landale was
also a busy hostess for the week. She had
Clive Armytage, Marcia Falconer, Fluffie
Cox and Estelle Simson from Melbourne,
and the Staughtons and Millears also
crowded in. The Hunter Pattersons like-
wise sacrificed the usual peace of their
home to the race invasion and rejoicings.
Governor Allardyce, just arrived in the
Speck with his cocked hat under his arm,
sprang a neat surprise on Hobart. It
expected a widowed Excellency, when be-
hold ! the man arrived with a new wife
and a stepson! Stepson had been scheduled
as private secretary.
Mrs. Bob Knox, who lately acquired
Greenknowe, Toorak, from Mrs. John San-
derson, poured tea and other nourishment
into a couple of hundred guests at a house-
warming. Mrs. Knox hostessed in dark-
blue satin with bands of mole fur, and her
sister, Mrs. George Landale, in brilliant
maize georgette, looked like an answer to
“What Will the Harvest Be?”
Big Colonel Tim Mdnerney has just con-
cluded an armistice with his old enemy the
gout, and when he can get a buyer for
his two-decker house in South Yarra, will
convoy his yellow-haired wife back to her
native England. Flapper daughter Aileen,
who is bent on a ’Varsity career, and her
small brother will be left at school under
the watchful eye of their devoted lawyer-
uncle, Dr. Mdnerney.
Wallscourt Kelly, nephew of mining-man
Bowes Kelly, is off to India to rejoin his
regiment, which is stationed on the North-
West Frontier. Lieut. Kelly left school to
go to the war. He was captain of Gee-
long Grammar in 1915.
Eileen Good’s perseverance has brought
her the diploma of architecture from the
Melbourne Uni. She is the first woman to
win the prize, and is one of the very few
—women or men—
who have gained
honors in the geology
of building stone,
which is part of the
architectural course.
Eileen has had a
thorough training for
her job. After leaving-
the High School she
was articled for four
years, and in her
spare time burrowed
into the mysteries of
architecture and
building construction
at the Working
Men’s College. Here
she made a reputa-
tion for originality
and abounding know-
ledge, and did big things in the annual exams.
Nowadays she feels competent to plan any-
thing from a cottage to a cathedral, though
if you want to give her a commission she
would be glad if you’d make it a cathedral.
It would please her reverend dad, who has
been long toiling at St. Jude’s, Carlton.
Mrs. Syd Sands gave a big tea-party at
Menzies’ last week. It was a hurried call
of her Melbourne friends for farewells. The
Sands go to Fremantle by train and catch a
liner for the Continent and England. In
France they will visit some of the mem-
bers of the French Mission whom Colonel
Syd piloted around Australia. They are
to have a couple of months in Holland, too.
Esther Crawcour has been here from Syd-
ney and has bagged her M.A.; the ’Varsity
allowed it to be credited to her in her
maiden name. Her married name is some-
thing unpronounceably foreign. She mar-
ried an Austrian diamond merchant, and fell
on bad times.
Mayoress Stein is following a precedent
of Lady Stanley in having parties exclu-
aively tot press-people. Lady Stanley always
insisted on tier poor Governor com-
ing In to band around tbe tea and
cake, and be waa like a big embar-
rassed schoolboy at the job. The
Mayoral party was out of town. Gaud
Mayor Aikman ow T ns an old home and many
acres at Mount Martha, one of the beauty
spots about the bay. He also owns a turkey
run and a fleet of motors. The head chauf-
feur, the two Aikman sons and a selection
of Town Hall officials ran the cars from
town to the Mount. The head cook col-
laborated with the fattest turkeys and con-
cocted a dinner fit for Shakspeares and Mil-
tons. Afterwards the town-bound press-
men and women wandered about, viewed the
beautiful beach, had more food, billiards and
speeches, and motored back to town in the
night. Mayor Aikman made speeches about
the beauties of the Australian coast, and sug-
gested taking the press people another time
right round the peninsula. That was the
late Kitchener’s particular haunt. Aikman
was at one with Kitchener in his opinion
that views are to be had there not to be
rivalled anywhere in the world.
Nora Clench
(Mrs. Arthur
Streeton), who
smiled into the
camera of Nancy
Weir, is a famous
violinist. She was
a pupil of Joachim,
and in a book about
that distinguished
musician’s life she is
named as one of his
four best pupils.
She was leader of
that Nora Clench
Quartet which had
a habit of playing
before crowned heads
until the heads com-
menced toppling off
their thrones. Dur-
ing the war she utilised her talent to draw
in Red Cross funds. Her visit to Australia
is a quite private one; she is merely accom-
panying (without music) her famous artist-
husband and their young son. An Irish
girl, this is her first glimpse of the best side
of the world.
Mayor Aikman’s son Ray has just saunt-
ered home from the wars. The rich young
man made an interlude by dodging around
America on the way. His pal in this stroll
was Jack Griffiths, the Australian impres-
ario. They came back together, and now
Griffiths is trying to book dates for a couple
of stars. But it is easier to find a needle
in hay than unbooked halls or theatres in this
country.
An unassuming, big, soldierly man, with
a fixed idea that the country came first in
war-time, was Colonel Duncan McLeish, of
Murrindindi station, Yea, who passed out
at a private hospital at Brighton. He had
command of the first Vic. contingent that
went to S’Afriea, in October, 1899, was
right through the campaign, and got a
C.M.G. He was in Egypt with the Remount
Unit during the late war and had a C.B.E
tacked on for his services, but that trip
shattered his health. Those who raised
their hats as the gun-carriage bearing
McLeish’s coffin rolled on felt that they
were paying the last tribute to a dinlyun
soldier-man.
Veteran motorist Sydney Stott, senior
vice-president of the R.A.C.V., is taking
Dr. Weigall’s place as president, vveigall,
who saw the war through as chief of the
volunteer-service for meeting returning
troops, is withdrawing from the chair because
he reckons it is time somebody else had a
turn. Stott’s career, as a motorist dates
back to the time when there were as.many
steam motor-cars in Melbourne as in-
ternal-combustion sorts.
John Madden’s widow is back in Aus-
tralia after a very-fleeting taste of the dis-
comforts of the Old World. She made her
first appearance at ’Varsity Commencement
where John was wont to make flowery
speeches in his Chancellor days. Mrs. Pat
Osborne came over from N. S. Wales to
meet her mother.
Alderman Hitchcock, who is the Anthony
Hordern and incidentally Mayor of Gee-
long, will probably get a handle to his name
after Edward scampers through. Melbourne
can’t have everything. The Pivot narrowly
missed being the capital. It sulked and then
got sleepy, but it woke up a few years ago,
and, roiling up its shirt sleeves, has been
doing things. Hitchcock is a pillar of
Methodism, but mixes good manners with
zeal.
Miss Seide, a large, handsome lady of
considerable tonnage in sassiety, had an
exciting time with a burglar at Toorak last
week. The burglar gms old-fashioned, and
crept into her bedroom with a lighted taper
instead of a flashing torch. The lady
screamed and bounded at the intruder, who
took a flying leap through the window. The
taper fired the curtains, and in the commo-
tion the man escaped.
A cheque for £282 has been handed over
to the Children’s Hospital, the amount gar-
nered out of the welter of the Dazzle Ball
at St. Kilda on March 5. The Fairbairns
were the leading spirits.
. Melbourne penwomen and other friends
of Mrs. M. Forrest, the Brisbane writing
lady, have been sending her sincere notes of
sympathy. Mrs. Forrest has had nearlj
two years of distressing illness, and she had
just got to the point of recovery when she
was able to take her aged mother out for
the little jaunts she loved; and then the old
lady, moving out of doors alone and stepping
off a footpath to avoid some building opera-
tions, was knocked down by a tramcar and
died within three hours.
From Sister Adelaide :
Our Gallery has bought another Streeton, to hang
below his old trees-refleeted-in-water, ‘‘Blue and
Gold.” (There is a brilliant third one in the
Gallery at present, of Sydney Harbor seen from
Cremome; but that is merely lent by Barr Smith.)
The new purchase is “Australia Felix,” a misty
long-distance view of Mount Mucedon. It date'
from 1907, and has been shown in both Royal
Academy of London and Salon of Paris.
There was a fashionable wedding at Christ Church,
Claremont (W.A.), the other evening, when Connie,
eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F. O. Gaze, of Clare-
mont, married Charles, son of the late also-Chark-
Moore, the tnan who passed on to his son huge
fluff businesses in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth,
Mother came from Toorak, and a large number of
relatives went across from the Eastern States to
the ceremony.
Adelaide has grown up to think its design is per-
fection, so citizens got a shock the other day when
the Government town-planner had his say. The
system of straight streets and right-angled junctions
is the oldest in history. Its origin is deeply rooted in
Chinese civilisations, sacred cities being planned in
accordance with astronomical law, which required the
streets to run north, east, south and west. But the
town-planner hints, in view of our hot winds from the
north and disagreeable breezes from the east, that
Colonel Light didn’t know his job when he intro-
duced the Chinese system here.
An engagement notable in the Hebraic
world is that of Wilma Cohen (who flats
with father and mother at swanky St. Leon-
ards) to Major Frank Bevy, son of the late
Waldemar Bevy, of Bendigo.
Eileen Marriot-Watson, daughter of a
well-known departed parson, has said “Yes”
to Colin Beith, a South Australian, nowa-
days of Fiji.
The Mavis Thiel-Gordon Chirnside baby-
daughter has started her trousseau already.
She had not been in this jazzed world more
than a week when uncle Russell Chirnside
sent her a perfectly matched string of pearls.
The butter-factory De Booses bad a
golden wedding last week at Euroa, of
which hamlet they are the pioneers. The
neighborhood threw gifts and good words at
them, and hoped they would see the cen-
tury in double harness.
Tourist bureaus in this country are State-
bound. They have only frayed scraps of
information to impart about a sister State.
For instance, some travellers searched Mel-
bourne last week for a time-table of South
Aus. railways. The Victorian office pro-
duced a moth-eaten publication three years
old and washed its hands of the matter.
The strangers, who wished to motor from a
Victorian dead end to a S. Aus. railway con-
nection, were forced to proceed in the dark.
South Aus. might take notice and send
over some literature.
However, three years seems to be as
nothing in the eyes of a tourist bureau.
Road maps are often older than that, and a
traveller reads “Road bad” where a brand-
new’ track has long since Deen laid. In the
same way N. S. Wales is primed with in-
formation of a coast route as far as Eden,
and Vic. is voluminous about the route from
Melbourne to Genoa, on the boundary. But
both bureaus lapse into vague generalities
about the connecting strip between Eden.
and Genoa.
For the first time Vic. State scho_ols have
had a Shakspeare Day. It happened on Fri-
day. The kiddies liked it so well, especi-
ally the scenes from plays, that they don’t
mind the order to make the commemoration
annual. Frank Tate, the director, an autho-
rity on William’s comedies, is responsible.
To make it clear to British aspirants for
the £5OOO a year railway job that a man of
parts was being sought. Arthur Robinson,
Attorney-General, talking in London, said
that it was necessary to unite to the civility
of a counter-jumper the dignity of a Cabinet
Minister, the resource of a canvasser, the
sociability of a club secretary, and the
expert knowledge of the heads of all branches
of a great railway system. Sam Barnes, the
Railway Minister, thinks Robinson did pretty
well, but omitted to mention that the chosen
one needs also the hide of a rhinoceros.
Apropos a recent mention of a decoration
having been awarded to a chef in the A.I.F.
(it was for sticking to his job in a hot spot),
there are 18 cooks and stewards at the Aus-
tralian submarine base, and they’ve got two
dozen ribbons among them.

From

STU[?]
A sky all ragged cloud-banners, from which
sharp spatters of icy rain fell at intervals
a sodden Domain and a line of Moreton
Bays trying their best to temper the blast
to the Anzaes own people who had followed
the procession in their thousands and stood
pressed against the barriers watching the
>O.l s swing into line for the memorial ser-
\K.e. Many of those watchers never again
to see their boy who had slipped down in
f w^,i dawn \ ng t^ > the waiting transport
in Woolloomooloo Bay. Lone Pine and
Quinns Post and the cemeteries in France
have laid their covering of decent mould over
the strong, brave limbs; but it was the
ghostly army ot glorious youth that drew
the mothers and fathers out in the rain and
the wind to honor the Boy’s colors. It
W i BS ~i ßoys °l the Dardanelles” the bands
played as the navy blue and leaf-brown
figures swung to their appointed places, and
it was to the beat of muffled drums that the
colors, streaming gloriously against the grey-
ness of the day, were assembled. But it
was to the opening hymn that the soldier’s
widow, her mouth a little wryed by the bit-
terness of things, listened, eyeing meanwhile
ittleS fin , children the stockingless
little gid of 10 shivering m the wind, against
which her print frock was as so much tissue.
Boys came in the Red Cross cars and lorries
filling each watcher with the golden memory

After the service Birdwood, begirt with
stalwart generals and well-groomed aides
and accoinpamed by “Fighting Mac,” made
r S vh A* An?ac tea *Party, at the Sol-
diers Club. Of course the boys were there
in battalions to greet him, standing on the
pavement, lining the vestibule, or ascend-
ing and descending the stairs as busy as the
angels in the pictures of Jacob’s ladder. A
!® wreath was h ! mg on the bottom post
of the banisters, and flags and flowers were
everywhere. Presently came Birdy on his way
to the tea-dnnking, led by Dr. Mary Booth
in his wake the stalwart generals. Sud-
fcv l ye . fell J u P° n a young man i;n a
1)1 ack felt hat and he stopped to exchange
a i?ff, etl . ng - 4 nd the young man in smart
soldiei tones Yes, sir’d, and No, sir’d, him
but otherwise took it as one pal to another!
in tact, if there was any shyness it was
on Birdy s side. But the Club is really too
small to entertain in. Poor old Biljjim’s
share ot the party generally consists of
standing in large, patient blocks in the pas-
sages outside the doors; and, after all, it’s
his own club!
The Army nurses turned out in great
toiee to the Cavell House garden party for
Birdwood; somebody whispered there were
of the blue-grey uniforms. Here and
there a sister staying at the Home added a
touch of color in the crimson of the Netley
After y° u bad shaken hands with
Mrs. Shaw and Matron Grey you walked
tniough the garden, past a lawn mushroomed
with tea tables, past the gabled, green-
embowered house, down to the tennis-court
where nurses and Birdwood, the advisory
committee and the house committee, with
dozens of Y.A.D.’s, made one big smile. Lady
Helen, m grey cloth and a feathered hat,
h k ad torn herself from the Infants’ Home at
Ash held at half-time, and for the rest of
the afternoon their Exes, walked the Cavell
House grounds. The Birdwood lady, in navy
and white foulard, seemed glad of the re-
spite from speeches.
Commandant Mrs. Chris. Bennett was
there, openly adored by her V.A.’s. Mrs
Toohey, who represents the Red Cross on
the committee, looked in and had a word
or two with 11. Y. Braddon. Mrs. Hugh
Dixson carried some priceless furs. Mrs.
Cecil Hordern and Gladys Owen and Mrs.
Uichard Meares were among other good
workers present. New State-Commandant
Bruche brought his tall, slight wife. Matron
Willow, the first matron of this nurses’ rest-
home, came in a black silk check dress.
Eileen Reece and Ethel Davey and the
simhng Stevens sisters, who have V.A.’d at
Cavell House since its very beginning, were
among the Marthas seeing to everything.
Many of the war sisters had got into
civvies, and. gloved and veiled and silken-
clocked, looked as though they had never
even seen a swab. One, in the most grace-
ful black rig-out, presented the latest thing
in Paris silhouettes; another, tall and slim,
was all embroidered muslin and wide Leg-
horn hat, with its brim floppy under the
weight of cabbage roses. But even the fluf-
fiest proudly displayed her war-service
badge, of which the price is beyond rubies
and pearls. Dr. Mary Booth was there, and
the Fiaschi couple, and Theo Cowan seeing
that every nurse within coo-ee had her ration
of sweets.
The house itself is a pleasant place of
panelled rooms and hallways, and at un-
expected turnings the light comes mellowed
through stained-glass windows. There are
mauve rooms and pink rooms and yellow
rooms, and for the party gorgeous and
radiant flowers glowed their life away
everywhere.
The War Chest and the Australian Com-
forts Fund had its cheerio for Birdwood
last week. It started in the Town Hall,
packed with strong battalions of women-
folk, carrying tiny flags to wave in the in-
tervals of the Commissioners’ speeches. In
the foreground sat the men who had busied
themselves with Comforts matters; the
women who had given time and thought,
and in many cases health, to keep the chest
filled and brimming-over were in the back
seats near the organ—and in "all the speeches
Mrs. Antill-Sargood’s name was never once
mentioned, and the Town Hall is still rock-
ing with the rustles of indignant woman-
kind. Another lady was mentioned by the
General in speaking of Aussie smokes, and
that was Miss Lucy Hinton. But, alas,
she’s no Australian belle —which, of course,
the General, not being a smoker, couldn’t
be expected to know.
From the Town Hall the Comforts
Funders went to the Australia, where the
General and Lady Birdwood, she in navy and
white frocking, shook more hands in the
shadow of palms. 11. Y. Braddon and Wood-
burn, of Victoria, were the General’s body-
guard. There were colonels and majors
wherever the eye could rest, and in a place
of honor sat Charley Oakes, who handles
this State’s invitation-end of the Royal
visitation. Precious few, if any, of the local
women war-chesters swallowed the oysters;
but there were five women-representatives
from the other States, chaperoned by Mrs.
Anderson, of Queensland. There were so
many people to talk that the guest had
to leave the lunchers to hurl the last of
the speeches in one another’s, teeth while
he fled to the Cavell House garden party.
Here is the good-looking wife of Com-
mander Glossop, who was one of the
MacPhillamys o f
Bathurst. Until last
week Mrs. Glossop
was president of the
Friendly Union of
Sailors’ Wives; she
succeeded Miss Hen-
derson in presiding
over the Naval
House functions.
Now she is off to
London, the Navy
having need of her
Commander nearer
home. (His ship
caught and sank the
Emden, you remem-
ber.) Mrs. Glos-
sop. as you can see
from this May
Moore photograph,
has a fine profile, and owns a pretty choice
in millinery.
The Women Painters got together from
the surf and the mountain-top and held their
first Bohemian night of the season at their
rooms. The social committee, which nearly
swallowed the art side of the club last year,
color tubes and all, has melted away under
the hot indignation poured out by artists in
revolt, and this year it is a purged and
shriven club that flings wide its doors. Mrs.
Sherwood came into town from a painting
holiday and flung a pretty wrap in emerald-
green tones over her black frock. President
of the Club Mrs. Earp wore black and gold
and brought a gentle-looking daughter in
pink. Betty Solomon wore a blue scarf and
a black frock, and Mrs. Rix Nicholas a
dress all silver and lavender puffs, a wonder-
ful lavender scarf, and a high and wide tor-
toise-shell comb to hold up her back hair.
The guest of the evening was Marjory Flook,
who uncorked a fiddle that has had four
years polish laid on it by the London
Academy. Esther wears a soulful expres-
sion and fuzzy hair, and her accompaniments
are played by sister Zelma. Other intervals
were filled by Miss Herd’s sweet, rather-
plaintive voice. The Club proposes having a
monthly talk on art, and good friend Julian
Ashton has promised to set the ball rolling
in May.
A number of well-known Sydney people
now in England, who would not believe that
the Prince could leave for Australia as soon
as he did. have failed to get passages on any
ot the fashionable liners. People now arriv-
ing booked early in November last, and many
as far back as August and September. Dis-
tracted at the prospect of missing the Royal
visit, the marooned loyalists offered them-
selves to those humbler shipping cos. which
feature ap “all one class” method of travel.
In vain! These lines proved to be as heavily
booked up as the others. Several people who
unwarily left Australia only the other day and
others who never come near the place under
ordinary circumstances, are now on their
way with tickets which they have bought at
a heavy premium from those who booked
last year, but proved willing to forego a
view of Edward for a satisfactory
consideration.
From the S. M. Herald :
Owing to the death of Lord Henry Hanghton Rey-
nolds, heir to the Earl of Ducie, Mr. B. B. Moreton,
M.L.C., becomes heir to the earldom.
There is no such style as “Lord Henry Rey-
nolds.” Deceased was Lord Moreton, at
one time a Liberal M.P. Berkeley Moreton,
who succeeds his nephew as heir to the
Ducie Earldom, has lived in Queensland’s
pestilential climate for 65 years, and is now
86. He entered Parliament in 1870, and
married Miss Kent, daughter of a Grown
Lands Commissioner, when he 'was 28. She
is still alive.
Gladys Verona is
the girl who was
specially engaged by
the Williamson
Grand Opera people
to sing Gilda in
“Rigoletto.” She has
a clear, strong
soprano, which
Roland Foster is get-
ting ready to send to
London. Add to this
youth, and health and
slimness, with a will
to succeed, and you
are looking at the
Gilda of future
Grand Opera
seasons.
Neotsfield, where the G.-G. has been stay-
ing, is one of N.S.W.’s show squattages. It
belongs to R. H. Dangar, whose wife was
one of the very “horsey” Dowlings. Her
father was regarded as the best four-in-hand
whip in Australia to the day of his death,
and she maintains the family tradition in
this respect.
A lady whose gentle hand helped to alle* 1
viate the sick-bed sufferings of thousands of
people whom she never saw crossed the
boundary when Mrs. Bessie Simpson—
“ Sister Bessie” in all the hospitals—died
at Marrickville. She arrived in Australia
from St. Thomas’s Hospital, London, to
organise the first nurses’ training school in
Sydney, 51 years ago, and is responsible
for the establishment of a system which has
equipped thousands of nurses. After several
years at the Sydney Hospital she became
matron at Gladesvilie, retired when 65, and
lived to be 83.
Deep sympathy is felt for Miss O’Keeffe,
the fashion autocrat of David ■ Jones’s, who
has lost her mother. Some time ago Mrs.
O’Keeffe broke her hip. She apparently
recovered, but a clot of blood formed, and
it caused her death last week. Old Albury
residents will remember her as Mrs. Richard
O’Keeffe, well known in that district 30 years
ago.
A big fight was put up last week for
the returned doctor, and most of the hon.
appointments at Prince Alfred went to him;
also he displaced a couple of men who were
on the staff during the war. Dr. Marjory
Little, who did bacteriological work with the
R.a.M.C.. having previously done three
years at the Lister Institute, was elected hon.
bacteriologist Soon she’ll take up practice
in Macouarie-street as a pathologist. Her
father, Dr. Little, who practised for many
years in Bananaland, then retired and settled
in Sydney, died the other day, while Marjory
was on her way home.
Mrs. F. J. Sheppard and daughter Helen
will be back in Sydney next month from the
Cold Country, where they have been doing
their bit in canteen and office. Mr. Shep-
pard, who drove a motor-lorry, and son John,
who served first in the infantry and then in
the Flying Corps, returned to Sydney the
other day. When the family went on war-
work Sheppard sold his station, Mooren, and
now he’s faced with the task of looking for
a home.
Obituary: June 9. 1920, T. Hat. Esq., aged
326. The dailies didn’t report the demise
that way. Then said: “At receptions on
arrival [of the Prince] or for the proces-
sion, official dress or morning dress (taU
hat optional) or lounge suit if desired.”
But it amounts to the same thing.
The last of the Beethoven Recitals was
given to a Conservatorium lined and packed
with enthusiasts, and Verbrugghen made his
first public bow as Chevalier of the Order
of Leopold. The “King Stephen Overture”
made a successful bid for popular favor, but
it was all hats off to the No. 9 Symphony.
Mrs. Verbrugehen. Dulcie Huxtable, Romani
and George English divided the solo parts
of the “Ode to Joy,” and the choir lifted
up a harmonious voice. Some night, with-
out a doubt, Conservatorium and Verbrug-
ghen will be blown clean to the stare bv
the hurricanes of applause into which th*
tempestuous music-lover flings hand and sole’
Lois Windeyer, daughter of the K.C., is
foing out after her own bread and butter
.he will earn it by running a taxi around
Double Bay and Darling Point. Lois, who
did motor-driving in France and in Eng-
land, is quite voung, and very attractive
in her driving outfit.
The cab horses had their show under th-
chaperonage of the S.P.C.A last week
coquetting with the judges in front of the
Art Gallery. The apple of Paris finally fell
to the beauty: owned by J. Colby. But while
they are about it, why doesn’t the S.PC \
inquire into the case of the placid old ek
phant at the Zoo, who works even on the
Saturday half-holiday, while her brother
luxuriates in a bad temper and a Rajah -
palace on the hillside?
A pretty wedding (among the w'eek’s ava-
lanche of almond-icing and white satin 1 was
Dorothy Craig, eldest daughter of
the Taylor Craigs, of Darlinghurst, to ex-
soldier Hector McLeod. Rev. J. Calder,
w r ho was chaplain to the ’groom’s battalion'
came from Forbes to take a part. Soft white
satin embroidered in pearls formed the pretty
and simple wedding frock that carried a
train from the shoulders; and the veil was
of Limerick lace. Three bridesmaids in jade
green and silver, carrying purple and green
posies (the colors of Hector’s Division)
helped the charming effect; and the Hotei
Mansions provided the eata.bles.
Lister Lister’s exhibition at Anthony Hor-
derns is still attracting a stream of admirers.
The cheapest bit on the programme is a cor-
ner of Glenbrook. which you can buy for
eight guineas. After that you pay anything
from 10 to 100 guineas. The hundred-guinea
oil-color is a charming and decent-sized hold-
ing on Nepean. “The Old Gum’’ and
Irees lhat Shimmer Through the Haze’’
are other pleasures of the show.
Surgeon Taylor Young, who has been
away on active service since the first sound
of the drums, is back, glad to drop the
Colonel and be plain Doctor. His wife and
a few r members of his family are sharing the
Wentworth with him.
Composer Arthur Benjamin was fortu-
nate in securing Arthur Appleby to sing his
group of songs at his recital last week: the
compositions proved of great interest t"
the platoon of lads and lasses who are going
to evolve into the Sullivans and Brahmses
of Australia. Franck and Chopin and
Debussy found a place on the programme,
and the young man proved conclusively
that he knew every axiom of musfcianly
Euclid.
From three to five on Wednesdays and
Fridays is jazzing time at the Voiuntarv
Workers’ Cafe, Elizabeth-street. Even
jazz you dance at the Cafe helps to build a
soldier’s home.
Mrs. McSwinney, who arrived on the
Orvieto, was Mrs. Alf Marks when she was
last in Sydney. Theo Marks's popular
brother got pneumonia while doing special
constable T s work in England early in th-
war and died very suddenly. Their only off-
spring, a tall, fair girl with a wonderful
skin, married Major Bertie Watson shortly
after the Armistice. He is a youn" squatter
who had a distinguished career in the A.I.F.
Amongst those yet to return is Lionel Law-
son, the boy violinist, whose art is known in
London as well as in Sydney. He is now
a lieutenant in the Royal Air Force. Whilst
training in Egypt he delighted several audi-
ences at Cairo and Heliopolis with his fiddle.
He was accompanied by Keith Barry, who
had the ’Varsity organ here prior to enlist-
ing. The staff got to hear of the concerts,
mostly impromptu affairs, and offered the
two Australians the job of selecting three
other artists and forming a concert party to
tour the Eastern front. But the boys both
explained that that wasn’t what they'd come
over to do, and declined with thanks. Law-
son expects to be back in June.
A pathetic fragment from Germany tells
of the wife of a professor who apologised
for a naked ottoman by saying that she
could not afford to buy clothes for the girls
at the prices ruling for materials, so she
had used the ottoman cover. Well, Heaven
knows that clothes are sky-high in Australia;
so there are prospects of reading in the
Herald that Mrs. Choyce-Cutte made a
graceful appearance in a hearthrug, and
while blanket effects were common, prob-
ably all were eclipsed by a quaint design in
variegated dish-towels worn by Mrs. Tom
Hopper.
The Union Club is grimly facing the fact
that it is down to a few dozen cases of vint-
age champagne. And at a time when the
approaching festivities will put as severe a
strain on the club’s cellar as it has known
in a quarter of a century! Good foreign
champagne is now almost unprocurable:
America is absorbing all that the Russian
plutocrats used to take and as much mor<-
as France will send. It seems the psycho-
logical moment for the great Australian clubs
to begin laying in stocks of Australian cham-
pagne. Not a bottle of it has been drunk
at the Union Club up to the present.

CORSETS and LINGERIE
for HOT CLIMATES.
Madame Sou in lias been able to solve a
long-standing difficulty of well-gowned ladies
residing in hot countries. She has produced
corsets and belts that are perfectly com-
fortable when worn in the most trying heat,
which at the same time have lost nothing of
the unmistakably Parisian style that marks
every creation of Madame Soum.
Corset belts and bust bodices are rust-
less and washable and very comfortable in
travel. They have patented unbreakable
bones. Made of a special material they
retain their shape until absolutely worn out.
Madame Soum makes a specialty of dainty
lingerie, blouses, dresses in the lightest and airiest
materials for tropical climates.

Ulsterman: You complain that to call
Carson “a rebel” is to use the language of "an
insh agitator.” He organised an army of rebellion
against the Home Rule Act of 1914, which is part
and pafeel of Britain’s Statute Law. That he failed
to bring about civil war was no fault of his. Here is
the law on the point as laid down by Lord Justice
O'Connor in August of last year, the accused men
being Sinn/Fein farmers: “The offence is complete
if preparations are made for rebellion or warfare,
even though that rebellion or warfare never takes
place, and is not intended to take place until and un-
less a certain contingency which may or may not
happen does happen.” If Carson, on that showing,
isn’t as much a rebel as any Sinn Feiner, then the
English language has no meaning.... Cud.yewa: It
is a good yarn ; but it has the Old Age pension. .. .
C.P.: Apparently there’s a case. But you don't
make your proposal clear. .. .N.A.0.: “Baby” and
“Vow” not up. ... J.H.W.: Not enough there, and
the verse doesn’t make much of what there i 5....
L.C.R.: Thin as a motherless foal in the haggard
wind of autumn.... L.t.'.M.: Bad verse. Yes, of
course, God decreed the profiteer and all the rest;
lint He also decreed that he should hang at a lamp-
pn.-t if anybody could catch him and was bold
enough to pull the rope. In fact, the “afflictions
placed on man” are fair things to share round....
Michael M.: One stirring stanza: —
The drunken husband lurched about the room
Hitting his wife with a big iron spoon.
She yelled out “Murder! Help! Police! You Wretch!”
And to her aid her cries a man did fetch.
He stood aghast, till the spoon his head flew past
And then he cried, “My God! that this should never
be,
I’d sooner throw myself into the dark, blue sea.”
He seized the brute by the throat,
And in the struggle tore off half his coat.
... .Cix: “Lantana” not up. . . .P.D.P.: Doesn't strike
us E.8.M.A.: Heavy and commonplace. ... Lufra :
Yon begin your long love poem:—
A heart once wounded undergoes a change
Which may or may not be
A fixed mutation.
To which we venture to reply:—
A Bulletin which printed tilings like that
Would turn into a corpse—
A fixed mutation.
. ...J.H.: “Night Wisdom” misses. .. .L. 0.5.: The
usual yarn... .R.J.8.: You kept the verses out of
sight for a year. Continue the good work. Let them
rest for 75... .F.M.C.: You describe it as “trash
that rhymes in places.” Just that... .JI.C.J.L.:
Verse doesn't carry it.... J.F.N.: Nothing in it....
Bill L.: “Quest” doesn’t do it. ... H.H.A.: Bury it:
and don’t ask us to the funeral.... Valkyrie: Why
don’t you read the paper?.-.. .R.S.Y.S. : “Slippin’ ”
is about as cheerful as the things one thinks of at
3 a.m D.L.S.: Verse bumps all over the place.
....Arthur S.: The same old idea, and pretty
poorly presented. .. .A.E.G.: Nothing there... .Mary
C.: The pictures arc better than the verse that
frames them. .. .G.W.F.: You mean well; so we
won’t say anything about the verse O.H.
(Adelaide): A little promise in it. .. .F.F.L.: Not
up, and not much in our line... .Trev: Very poor
verse M.S.: “Riversdale Road” won’t carry you
into The B E.R.A.: Shocking 0.C.R.: Poor
and about nothing much.... Berwyn: Very lumpy.
. ...W.S.W.: Not for us. .. .S.R.L.: The verse
doesn’t strike us. It’s an old theme in a common-
place setting... .Darby: Dreary. .. .L.M.D.: Not up.
.. . .N.C.M.: Some of it nearly, but the verse doesn’t
get to anything; and it isn’t clever enough to be
cheerful nothing W.F.F.: Australia claimed
£464,000,000 from the not-so-badly-beaten-as-it-
ought-to-have-been enemy—£364,ooo,ooo war expen-
diture and £100,000,000 cost of pensions capitalised.
It was awarded £100,000,000, payable in 30 years
—and a lot of things happen in 30 years. The
most Hughes, who was chairman of the British Re-
paration Committee, has of late had any early hope
of getting is a trifle over £5,000,000. That, he
has said, may come next year.. . .E.C.8.: No use.
yarn —.F.G.E.: Horrible yarn and impossible situa-
tion. .. .F.8.G.: Don’t care for it. That metre is
in itself a parody... .L.B. (Brisbane): Poor verse.
.... S.P.: “Desecration” is nearly as bad as it
could be... .G.H.8.: Even as grovel verse it grovels
a bit too low E.A.C.: Beautiful copy, but that’s
the best that can be said. .. .P.M.: Commonplace,
and doesn't get to anything.. . .1.P.: Don’t remember
“Council,” but “Leper” has neither force nor beauty.
... .O.F. (Lakemba) : Very far off. ... A.E.R.: Not
well enough done....W.H. (Palmerston N.) : As far
as we can read the pencil scrawl it is hopeless.. .. .
Oliver B.: The “Memoriam” verses -stand first in
their class:—
...P.P.P.P.: Don't, like your pimple. It's clumsy
fake.. .-L.R.C.: You’ve a good way to go....A.6.
(Cairns): Sorry. Nothing, in the verses that any
girl of 17 mightn’t write.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
IV. V.: See what you can do with India ink and
Bristol board... .C.G.: La Belle France is cock-
eyed. Draw with more care and try to beat the
stodge out of your cartoons. .. .T.S.M.: The champion
racehorse in the distance looks like a sausage on
legs...,Lea: There’s always a market here for ideas
that will illustrate. They’re worth from ,>*. to a
pound.... R.M.M.: The drawing doesn’t amount to
anything, but if you invented the name of Mrs.
Gubgub you deserve a vote of thanks Bottom
Bung: Good try. Study and try again.... Inglis A.:
Received one court scene. Where's the joke?....
E.P.: Don't want picture of prosperous butcher
engaging a small ape as errand boy... . .J.P., .Tun.:
You scratch feebly... .T.F. : Too small and wooden.
To loose one so fond and true,
His place ’twill be hard to fill ;
Done his best for all he knew,
No more will he instill.
• His memory will be everlasting,
His acts of loyal and generous;
Never once thought of backing,
But stuck to righteous.
Fought for the love, his countn 's sake,
'He died at the helm.
Put his heart and soul at stake,
He sought all to whelm.
For one who stood the greatest of test,
May he quietly ever vest,
With our blessing ever blest,
Lying snug in his little nest.

The Mother of this Sturdy
Young Rexona Boy writes:—
I have been using Rexona Soap on my
little boy Ronald’s hair ever since his birth,
and he is now two years old. lam simply
delighted, how lovely Rexona Soap ha's
made his hair. I have seven children, ami
the hair of all the others is straight.
Ronald’s hair is so soft and fluffy and curly
that all the neighbors ask me what I do to
make it so. I simply tell them, I wash it
with Rexona Soap.
There is nothing like Rexona Soap, I think.
I tell my friends to try it too, and they will
soon think as I do. lam sending you a
picture of Ronald, for he is a real Rexona
boy. and simply loves Rexona Soap.

The Rexona habit results in health and beauty, and once formed will never lie

There are two Rexona habits—that of using Rexona Ointment to heal all Injuries

pure with a delicately-scented and medicated soap. Rexona Ointment and Rexona Soap

I,4 OLDIER, soldier, where have you
been ?”
“Playing at battle out ou the green,
till, mother, the men marched left and right.
And the little white corporal led the tight.
Come out and see how the wounded lie
And the dead men stare on the round, blue
sky.
For my side won and Billy's went down
In their khaki caps and muskets brown !”
She kissed the tip of the small, snub nose,
And pinched the cheek like a fresh pink rose.
“Poor mother is weary,” she said, “to-day.
Get nursie to go and watch you play.”
'Soldier, soldier, where have you been?"
“Killing a man I have never seen.
Oh, woman, the paint on our toys was red.
And the bullets of play were made of lead.
Go out and look where the crosses stare
I.ike a crowd of ghosts on the sightless air.
For the little white corporal led men well
As he did when Billy's tin army fell!”
She looked at the lawn where her dead sods'
sons
Still played at war with their wooden guns.
“Poor mother is weary,” she wept, “to-day.”
And the phantom fathers watched the play.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
k LL day long the wind had howled
•-% around the schoolroom where, with
other country boys and girls, Tim
Maughan was imprisoned. It was the longest
day the boy could remember —from eight
o’clock, when his mother had walked with
him to the paddock-gate. She had kissed
him almost sadly, he’ thought, while she kept
him behind his little brothers and sisters
and had put into his hands her birthday pre-
sent—his dead father’s watch.
"You are 13 to-day, my son; soon the
years will make you a man. Do not forget
that your mother looks to you.”
She turned and was gone before he had
seen the tears that streamed from her eyes.
And a new-born shyness made him incap-
able of running back after her as he would
have done only a month ago. Instead, he
put the watch unexamined into his pocket
and joined the other children.
Only when they were nearing the school-
house did he lag behind, and, sheltered by
an old tree, take out his treasure. He set it
at the right time and wound it up; then
slipped it again into his breast pocket, and
when the slow hours ivere almost intolerable
the touch of it comforted him. Now at last
school was over, and he was able to slip
away, on the excuse that he must get in
the cows and do the evening milking.
Over the hills he plodded, a little sturdy
figure, his head a trifle bent the better to
meet the cutting wind; his eyes unheedful
of the shadows creeping along the grass;
in his head but one thought, that he must
do something. Why he did not know. But
the watch in the depths of his pocket brought
desire into his heart. A feeling, half-
exultation, half-terror, possessed him as he
said over and over again, “Thirteen to-day,
a man soon!” Involuntarily he shrugged
his thin shoulders, and clenched his hard,
work-soiled hands.
The sight of the cows brought him to his
everyday senses, and his brain turned
eagerly' to the problem of earning more
money.
When he got to the sliprails leading to the
cowvard his mother was there ready to milk
half" and half with him. But he pushed her
outside and said, while his face flushed, “No,
not to-night, mother; let me do them all. I
won’t be tired —please.”
The mother, by the miracle of mother-
hood, understood, and went off quietly to
the house. The milking took a long time,
but the doing of it brought strength to the
sturdy back and arms. How tired he was
he did not know, for mental exaltation was
over him as he walked into the farm kitchen.
He ate a big meal—“a man’s meal,” his
mother said, as she cut him extra pieces of
bread and butter, and added cold meat,
something he had never had before with his
supper.
When the meal was over the other child-
ren were washed before the log fire and put
to bed, and he sat in the big rocking-chair
and watched her in the light of the home-
made candles.
While she worked she talked, at first
jerkily, but the quick appreciation of his
upturned face gave her confidence and she
soon became more expansive. He had heard
the story often enough : the father a lonely
exile from the books and studies he loved,
eating out his heart in a country parsonage;
his death from consumption, making all the
sacrifices of ambitions and loneliness seem
no- worth the while; and the rest he knew.
But to-night his eyes rested on a box at
ti e end of the living-room. It had not been
there before. The mother explained. They
draeeed it before the fire to open it.
“His books, my son. I can think of
nothing else he would want you to know more
than these. Your schooldays must soon be
over, but these will help you. You can get
them when you want them ; n this box. but
I’ll hide it from the children under the
dresser.”
They dragged it back again: but before
it was closed the boy shyly took at random
two books, chosen perhaps because of their
newer binding, whose red was still warm
in the candlelight. Then he kissed his
mother good-night, and. taking his candle,
went to his little camp-bed in a room off
the living-room—really only a pantry, but
given to him to mark his dignity as the
eldest son of his mother.
Night after night he read h' c bo-W until
his mother playfully commented on the ex-
penditure of candles. Then he tucked a book
under his coat when he went to school, and
read as he brought the cows home at sunset.
And as he read the world of low-growing
hills and cows and milking grew dim. and
the arenas where old-time warriors fought
were vividly before his eyes. Especially did
the stories of old pagan days lire his. blood,
and the boyish knees that had never willingly
bent before the shadowy God of the little
country chapel led him eagerly to the drip-
ping altar of the gods that asked so much
but were a present aid to the people who
bowed the knee to them.
In his boy's mind the dull world faded
at a point just beyond the horizon. Beyond
was the world his father had loved, where
men strove for the mastery over each other
and the dreary virtues of the farmers were
forgotten. So he dreamed on, and in his
dream-world fauns, nymphs, gods and men
were his familiars. But it was a fighting
world, and now each night his arms were
stout enough to milk all the cows, for in
the gloaming as he milked he could dream
the great dreams of the world outside.
Even his sturdy efforts did not make the
winter easier, and day by day the mother
watched her resources grow less. One
night she walked down to meet him as he
came out of the cowyard, and taking the
heavy bucket from him emptied the last
lot of milk into the cans on the pantry
shelf. Then she gave him supper and told
him the children were in bed. He knew
that meant something serious, and, supper
over, he went to his old place beside the fire.
She did not get up to do the dishes, but
leaned over him, her arm on his shoulder.
“My son, Graham is opening a store at
the station. He came to-day to offer you
10 shillings a week. The money would
help us—and he would give us our clothes
cheaper for it.”
They neither of them spoke for a time.
Then he asked: “When do I begin?”
The mother slid to her knees and tried to
take him in her arms; but he got up and
said manfully: “It’s a good chance, Mum —
don’t you worry.” Then he went out and she
forbore to call him back.
He walked till he reached a patch of moon-
light on the crest of a little hill far enough
away to shut out the light of the kitchen.
He knew that his mother was thinking of the
shortening of his school days, but for him
that meant nothing. He had found a new
school beside which the other was nothing.
He felt a little depressed with the import-
ance of the decision, as he had on his thir-
teenth birthday; but now his books had
taught him an outlet. He had been half-
unconscious of the passing of childhood ; to
the coming of manhood he was keenly,
joyously alive. But to-night the stories
from his books and the misty moonlight came
between him and the prosaic world.
Suddenly he saw something move iu a
stump near by. He was on the alert at
once, and tiptoed over to it. It was just the
last flicker of a stump that was being burnt
out; he realised at once that if the work
was to be done properly the fire must be
kept going, and he searched around for dry
sticks.
As he built up the fire he remembered the
story he had last read —of the soldier who
had burned the letters from the girl in Gaul
and sacrificed to his dead youth. A half sob
of pity rose in his throat; for the first time
he saw the store as a continuation of the
prison the village school had been. Slowly
he walked over the hill, heading towards the
kitchen light, and as he went the moonlight
worked fantastic dreams in his brain. He
crept into his little room, took his shang-
hai, his few bits of string and iron, the odds
and ends from which poverty’s child fashions
his playthings. Then, catching sight of
the cage that held his two white mice, he
snatched it up as he went quickly but silently
into the white night, stopping only once to
make sure that his penknife was in his
pocket.
Over the hill he fled to the stump now
burning brightly. He piled it with twigs
till he could feel the heat of the flames
three feet away. Then he knelt before it,
and slowly threw his treasures one after
another into the flames. As they were
burnt his eyes grew bright and he ’glanced
hurriedly round him, as though fearful of
surprise. In his excitement he hardly knew
which he feared most —a human footfall or a
faun’s step. But the night was gathering
dark and the moon was setting. Nothing
but the roaring of the wind came to his ears.
He bared the blade of his penknife, felt
its edge and drew the cage to him. The
two mice crowded to the door of the cage,
and as he opened it one ran out up his
sleeve. He shut the door abruptly on the
other, and took Whitey from the cover of
his sleeve and laid him on the ground, and
struck through his heart with all the fierce-
ness of a savage. The mouse quivered and
stretched out dead.
The boy’s face went white, but he reso-
lutely opened the cage, took out Melisande
and the penknife came down again in
fierce determination. But he had to try
a second time, while the slight sounds of
protest sounded in his ears like shrieks
from a siren.
This time he aimed true.
When his hands felt steady he took the
two treasures of his childhood and laid
them on the glowing stump. The rising wind
made moaning among the trees that swayed
towards him. The whole hill seemed to be
full of strange music, and in his heart the
pain of parting from something, he knew
not what, brought hard sobs to his throat.
As the mice burnt the flame leaped up.
and as he lifted his tear-stained face he
saw the leaden ring Whitey had worn on
its left foot —it had taken much making.
He snatched at it as the flames showed it
clearly, and drew back his burnt hand with
a sharp cry of pain.
He lay on the grass looking at the stars
that came out lazily till the air worked on
his burnt hand, and the pain became hard
to bear. Then he picked himself up and
went home over the hill, taking the empty
cage and his blood-stained penknife, the
last trophies of his youth,
The mother was at the gate with a lan-
tern.
“I was coming for you. my son. I
thought”—•— She caught sight of the cage.

WONDERFUL ZAM-BUK HEALING.
What a blessing Zam-Buk is in the home—how remarkably soothing, wonderfully healing and
powerfully antiseptic are the virtues of this g:eat natural Healer—is strikingly illustrated in t e
case of Mrs. Ellen McCormack, of 30 Egan Street, Newtown, Sydney, who writes:
The Zam-Buk Co.,
Dear Sirs, .
Twelve months ago I burnt my left knee through my clothes catching fire. The flam3s
ate into the flesh and the burns festered and became greatly inflamed, and blood-poison set
in. My leg became in a frightful condition, and it swelled up from the knee to the thigh. I went
into a hospital, and, after being unsuccessfully treated for months in the ward, I was turned out
incurable, and I thought I would be crippled for life. The pain was dreadful, and I suffered night
and day. Sleep was out of the question, and I would toss about from side to side in great agony.
Doctors were consulted and all sorts of o ntments were tried, but the leg seemed to get worse.
I was in despair as to being cured, but mv husb and recommended me to try Zam-Buk. 1 did so,
knowing it was good, but did not think it would be so healing in this instance. Therefore, you
cam imagine how pleased and surprised I was to realise that it did me good from the first appli-
cation. I continued for about two pots, and it was almost incredible how quickly all the inflam-
mation subsided; the matter was drawn out, an d, after two weeks’ treatment, my leg was cured.
Another instance of Zam-Buk’s value wa» when I was one day chopping wood at Cowra,
where we were living. A piece of wood stru :k me on the ankle, and the leg became poisoned.
Two holes formed in it, and I consulted chem'st and doctor, but all sorts of treatments proved
unavailing. It was at my husband’s request I was induced to again fall back on Zam-Buk, and I
did so after two or three months unsuccessful treatment with other remedies. The leg in this
instance also was cured after being laid up for two months prior to using Zam-iiuk, but after
Zam-Buk was used the leg healed and soon became well.

“I don’t want white miee any more—
and the others would forget to feed them.”
Her heart was heavy with the cares of
to-day and yesterday, and she only nodded
in assent. She, too. was beginning to feel
that time was passing for him.
But by the kitchen light she saw his
drawn face, and the tightly clenched hands
and ran for remedies. As she applied oil
and flour she looked into his eyes, but lie
would not meet her questionings and in
silence held up his face to kiss her good-
night.
“Is that all, my son?” she said gently as
she took his face in her hands and kissed
his tight-drawn lips.
All the child iu him craved for the refuge
of her arms, the peace of her bosom, but
the man’s lips whispered harshly “That’s
all,” as he drew himself away and reached
for liis candle.
GLADYS TAYLOR HAIN.
Drought.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE was a very ordinary man, differing
not at all from many others equally
prosperous, equally sleek, sitting in
office chairs in various parts of the city.
The clerks had gone home, and in a
few minutes he would be on liis way
to dinner. It was his practice at such
times to lean back comfortably and sur-
vey the events of the day—why it was
that this customer had failed, what was
the cause of the success of that; perhaps
sometimes to trace back the history of his
growing power to the days when he had
first arrived and put his savings into this
venture.
He .thought of these things now. It was
pleasant to reflect that it was all one’s own
doing—the successful sales of stock, the
balance always on the right side. Yes, and
the hard work! He could feel with his finger
the long, thin edge of the scar running
from the corner of his eye to the chin,
the scar which had been left by the
falling branch of a tree out there on his
land. That must have been 20 years ago
now. What fools these Westerners were!
Why did they not sell out and come to the
cities, where they might see things, count
for something, acquire wealth and power?
They were all improvident, too —always
borrowing money, never saving.
He picked up a letter from his desk and
read it for the third time. Here was con-
firmation of his thoughts. This was one of
the improvident lot; and, because the
writer happened to be an old neighbor of his,
successful in the days when he had been at
the beginning of things, the letter had a
savor and a smack all its own. The big man
and the little man! He had been the little
man. Now the positions were reversed, and
he was being asked for time.
Well, lie would not give time. The power
to refuse was his. That wai it—power,
power!
Twenty years is quite a long time iu a
man’s life; long enough to forget little acts
of kindness. He had been young then, and
afterwards —the city. There are so many
things to think about in the city, and the
getting of money is not the least of them. No,
this man should feel his power. To-morrow
he would go out and inspect so that he might
have a grasp of the situation when he re-
turned and made arrangements for a sale.
lie got up out of his chair, put the letter
on a file, and went home.
* * * *
On the edge of a dreary plain, without
water, without grass, burnt and scorched
and seared, where the sun’s rays struck and
struck again like a fiery sword wielded by
giant hands from out a pitiless sky, and the
cracks in the baked earth grinned and gib-
bered like twisted mouths crying in torment
for water, stood two men. the very
antithesis one of the other; efficiency and
inefficiency, weakness and strength. Yet
it all lay in the setting of the picture. The
fat man did not fit into the landscape, the
other did.
“Where are your stock?” said the fat
man.
The lines on his companion’s face
deepened; the grim lips became grimmer.
“Stock?” lie said. “I have no stock. They
died weeks ago. I thought I told you that
in my letter.”
The fat man did not see the look that
came into the other’s eyes; he was busy
calculating possibilities—how much of bis
money would he be able to save from this
wreck? When lie turned to speak again the
devil that had looked forth for an instant
was gone, and lie saw only the patient, tired
expression that had been on the face of his
companion ever since liis arrival.
“I suppose you realise,” said he, “that
I can’t give you time. You are all the
same —never saving, never putting by for
a drought.”
“I knew what you would say,” said the
other. “That is why I brought you here.
But there is one thing more I want you to
see before you go.”
Together they walked through a patch of
scrub and out on to the edge of wliat had
once been a swamp. Four or five crows
flew up and away. From the green slime,
festering and rotting in the sun, protruded
the head and neck of some beast —a head
without eyes.
The city man had enough. He turned
to speak to his companion ; but he had gone.
It was as if he had never been there. There
was the edge of the scrub just behind ; here
was the half-dried mud at his feet; and
death looked out from the sockets of those
sightless eyes—looked out and grinned.
A strange little cold shiver ran down the
man’s back. He was not exactly afraid.
Doubtless he had been absorbed in what he
had seen and had not noticed the other’s
disappearance. He would, of course, be
back in a minute or two. Meanwhile this
was not the pleasantest place to wait in.
He walked back towards the trees and sat
down on a log. A great black crow with
beak agape, the thick glossy feathers of
its throat rising and falling as it breathed,
looked sideways at him out of a dead tree.
It was not till half an hour had gone that
fear came. It was not till he had walked
up and down the edge of the scrub and
shouted himself hoarse that the fat man
realised what had happened—knew that he
was alone in unfamiliar country, without
water and far from help; remembered the
little peculiarities of his companion’s ways,
the word here, the word there. “That is
why I brought you here.” It all came to
him now', the diabolical meaning of it. He
set out in the direction v'hence they had
come. He forgot that his long years of city
life had robbed him of initiative and cour-
age —that if he had been a bushman once
he w’as one no longer.
All through the heat of the day he
struggled on. One of the ends of his starched
collar had come adrift and hung down over
his shoulder, a limp, sweat-drenched, ludi-
crous tiling. On his left foot was a tan
shoe scratched out of all semblance to its
original fashionable neatness. The other
foot was clothed only in the remains of a
sock, through wdiich poked a torn and bleed-
ing great-toe. It seemed to him that he had
been walking all his life. The sun struck
down on his head and upon the double roll
of fat on the back of his neck, and the white,
hot glare from the dry bed of a rocky creek
down which he blindly staggered tortured
his eyes. lie walked in a daze, knowing
nothing save the horror of bis sufferings.
It was strange the little tilings that wor-
ried him, the trifling matters that were of
no importance. There were these clothes
now; there was something wrong about liis
clothes. He had not yet decided what it
was; but he knew that there was some-
thing out of place, incongruous.
Every now and then lie stopped and wiped
the sweat from his face with his coat sleeve.
It was a tweed coat with checks. He never
remembered seeing such a coat before. And
that shoe. He tried to remember where he
had got it and what had become of the
other one. Red ants crawled upon his toe.
There were three of them ; he counted them
carefully lest he should be mistaken. Then
lie wiped them off against a stone and re-
sumed his interminable journey.
It was late in the afternoon that the
vision came to him —the presentation in
concrete form of all that was evil and hor-
rible. He walked up towards a patch of
stunted bushes at the head of a gully that
ran away towards scattered clumps of grass-
trees in the distance. He had no idea in
what direction he was going. He stumbled
on, pausing now and then to listen to the
whir of the cicadas, army answering army
across the gully, the very spirit of drought
and heat. A champing, grunting sound came
from in front. The man looked up aud saw
a black, gaunt thing with little, bloodshot
eyes, from which the spirit of ferocity and
all wickedness shot forth; a great, gaunt,
slab-sided wild pig. an old emaciated sow
from the thorny wilderness out beyond, and,
below her, w T hat was left of a dead ewe.
The beast lifted her head and looked at
the intruder. A thin trickle of obscenity
dripped and stopped and dripped again from
the corner of her mouth to the dust of the
cattle-pad on which she stood; and, as if
to emphasise the horror, a lamb nuzzled
against the belly of the she-devil, this mur-
derer of its mother.
The man did not know what happened
after that. He lied through the bush. lie
passed dead beasts on his way. The taint
and smell of death was everywhere.
In the evening he reached a house and
went in ; but there was no one there. He
wondered where the occupants had gone.
The place seemed strangely familiar; but the
silence worried him. He lifted his head to
listen. There was no sound; only, from
far away, the liowl of a dingo, one of the
legions that came down out of the great
silences of the back country in times such as
these to worry and to kill. A beetle flew iu at
the broken window and landed with a crash
against the wall. The man started at the
sound: was the loneliness driving him mad?
Strange fancies took possession of him. This
was bis house. Those starving brutes out
there were his sheep. If the rain came lie
might still save something, always provided
that lie was given time, that they were merci-
ful to him down there in the city.
He fell on his knees, his fat soft knees,
in the checked trousers, and there, in the
dust of the floor, lie tried to pray. But
the grim, black thing rose up and mouthed
at him. and he went out into the night and
cried aloud to the empty spaces, shrieked
and cried and sobbed to the blinking stars.
He was found next morning and taken
back to the city; but the letter lying on
the top of his file of correspondence was
never answered.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Hero there is quiet: not a wind, a-stir
With summer, whispers in the shadowy
glade,
And in the cool of many a beeehen shade
The silent leaves await their gatherer.
No bird sings now', nor any golden bee
Wakes the still twilight with his drowsy
hum ;
That I might think the very night was dumb
With some strange presence passing ecstasy.
Here there is quiet: yet the earth is red
With blood that clamors upward to the
light.
The world is making moan above its dead.
Beneath, unfathomable fires are bright;
Life throngs about me, and above my head
Abysmal stars swirl onward through the
night.

REFRIGERATING AND
ICE-MAKING MACHINERY.
While the Greatest* Selling factor in our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN UUNNING —which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal'for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.” Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of your
plant, not only ro accomplish a given result, but to do so with
an initial expenditure and maintenance cost!* Our extensive
experience we place at your service.

A Valve that Stays Tight—The “EVERLASTING” VALVE.
WHEN responsible engineers after testing an article adopt it as standard for every service
for which it is suitable, specify it in their specifications, recommend it to other engineers,
and have nothing but praise for it, the article must possess great intrinsic merit. That
is what has happened to the “Everlasting” Leak-proof Valve, and that is why this Valve is specified
by the Commonwealth for their new steamers, by the New South Wales Railways for all new
Locomotives, by such large , users as The Broken Hill Proprietary, the Colonial Sugar Refining
Co., G. & C. Hoskins Ltd., by innumerable smaller concerns, and by shipping companies. For
a particular service one shipping company, after testing every other valve without getting one
to stand more than a few months, tried an “Everlasting”; after 12 months’ service it has
mmimmeiw
just been taken out for examination and found to be as sound and tight as the day it was put in.
The Everlasting Valve is not cheap to buy, but it is remarkably cheap to use, for it never leaks and never wears out,
It is made in all sizes and all kinds of metal of the best quality material, and by highly-skilled mechanics, and is
the only truly self-grinding valve extant.
