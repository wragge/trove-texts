SATURDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1892.
Neild, M.P., and the Bar Sinister.
The approbation which the Legislative
Assembly of New South Wales stamped upon
the bill submitted to it providing for the
legitimatisation of children born out of wed-
lock on the subsequent marriage of their
parents, marks a tendency of feeling towards
the removal of disabilities radically unjust.
The distinction which at the present time
exists between children born out of wedlock
and those born after marriage is insusceptible
of any moral defence, so far as the children
themselves are concerned. It is based in
part upon grounds of convenience, in part on
grounds of superstition, and in part on
grounds of arrogance. But as none of these
foundations are solid enough to bear investi-
gation, it is pretended, as is usual under such
circumstances, that there are other and more
substantial foundations for the prevalent
practice. The sacred name of Morality is
dragged into the question, just as Liberty is
used as (he excuse for oppression. The influ-
ence of elevated example bears heavily on the
subject. So long as monarchs are hereditary,
it is important that there should be no doubt
respecting the person entitled to succession
to a throne. The history of Oriental nations,
where marital connections are loosely de-
fined, furnishes abundant examples of civil
wars, conspiracies, assassinations, and devas-
tations, consequent upon rival heirs to
thrones. And where there is, even in
the humbler ranks, any considerable
estate or property to succeed to, a
similar, although not so powerful neces-
sity exists for a clear legal definition of
heirship. In the case of sovereigns, even
among what are termed Christian nations,
and in modern times, this necessity has
occasioned, and still occasions, the gravest
inconveniences. The real essence of here-
dity is displaced by a spurious substitute.
If heredity has any genuine claims it is on
the supposition that the great qualities of a
great ancestor are transmitted to his progeny.
But the science of physiology shows that from
one sire there may proceed very different
offspring, differing in the degree in which
they inherit the qualities of that parent,
according to conditions attached to the cir-
cumstances of their procreation. The
natural law and the artificial law are per-
petually in antagonism. The bastard child
is, as regards monarchs, generally the natur-
ally legitimate one, and the legal offspring
illicit. That is to say, the former is begotten
in consequence of a genuine inclination, the
latter in cold obedience to a political obliga-
tion.
# # *
It would serve the purpose*just as well were
the first son of every sovereign recognised as
the heir to the Crown. In fact, any son, first
or second, by mistress or by wife, provided
only the rule were fixed, explicit, and in-
vested with the currency of unchallenged
and prevailing acceptation and recognition.
The natural law applicable to people
of ordinary condition is that every child
is as much entitled to the protection
of a father as any other child. The
question 'of succession to property is
obscured by a complete tangle of com-
plications resulting from corrupted social
conditions. Justly regarded, no man should
have great accumulations, and no child is
entitled to wealth unearned by him or her.
The natural title is simply to subsistence
during infancy and until the vigour requisite
for self-support is attained. The whole
question has been grievously beclouded by
the manifold confusions introduced by
policy, property, priests, and pride. If the
object were to assist a higher morality, the
recognition of the first-born, without respect
to wedlock, would best serve the purpose.
The pitiful imitative servility of peoples
leads them to follow the example of their
princes and nobles. Among princes and
nobles the distinction between legiti-
mate and illegitimate heirs notoriously
induces a prevalent-—not an occasional—
defiance of those alleged obligations which
their priests constantly impose upon the
vulgar. Almost every male Sovereign Prince
in Europe has his morganatic wife, as well
as his legitimate spouse. As generally the
morganatic wife has been the first, it is she
and her children who are, according to the
religious rule, lawful, and the State wife and
offspring are the mistress and the bastards.
* * *
Such a law as the New South Wales
Assembly adopted by a second reading,
could consequently not be entertained for a
moment in Great Britain or any other
monarchical country. It would, in the
absence of George lll.’s Royal Marriages
Act, or some similar enactment, restraining,
denying, and vitiating the sacramental effect
of the marriage ceremony, as that Act does,
affect the succession to the throne. Under
its provisions George IV. might have, in-
stead of dying childless, gone through the
ceremony of marriage on his death-bed with
one of the mothers of his numerous illegiti-
mate offspring. His brother and successor,
William IV., although he likewise had a
large family by Mrs. Jordan, could not have
equally made one of them heir to the throne,
because his childless wife, Queen Adelaide,
survived him. These instances are cited
with the purpose of presenting in high
relief the fact that the prevailing system,
which stamps with ignominy from the hour
of birth all children born of unions not
recognised by statute, is founded, not upon
morality, but in antagonism to it. Morality
is subordinated to mere convenience, and
what is merely inconvenient is branded as
immoral. The sacrament of marriage, in
the case of a member of the British Royal
Family, is no protection against concubinage
and bastardy to the wife and the children of
such a marriage, unless the union has been
authorised by the reigning sovereign. The
Church may declare a prince or a princess
the spouse of a woman or a man, yet, despite
the sanction of the priest, the wife or the
husband so wedded are in the eyes of the
law and of society, merely the concubine or
the lover, and the children are bastards. In
consequence of this, it is lawful for the
prince or the princess so wedded at the altar
to marry again, if the consent of the sove-
reign be obtained, and that later union,
sheer bigamy although it be, is recognised as
moral, and the offspring therefrom are
capable of inheriting the throne.
* * *
It is vain for British subjects, in view of
these facts, to apply to the question of
legitimacy arguments derived either from
sacerdotalism or from conventional morality.
These grounds having been deliberately set
aside by the Head of the Church, by the
chief priests of the State religion, and by the
Legislature, cease to be available. The ques-
tion has been reduced to one of convenience.
But the principles of justice which comprise
the real morality are superior alike to mere
convenience and to convention. The rights
of children, begotten without consent of
their own and without conceivable sin of
theirs, are as much the concern of justice as
the rights of any other human beings. That
any such children should be pursued through
life with infamy not incurred by any act of
theirs, and by deprivation of the share in
inheritance which the very blood which
courses through their veins entitles them to,
is inconsistent with justice. Every effort
which may be made to remove that injustice
is therefore creditable to those who partici-
pate in it. The bill which has passed its
second reading in New South Wales,
although necessarily only partial in its pur-
poses, is one which redounds to the credit of
its author, Mr. J. 0. Neild, and to that of
the community in which it has found so
much acceptance. Although it purports only
to legitimatise children of parents who marry
subsequent to their birth, and leaves for the
present unrecognised children equally entitled
to the consideration of society—those whose
parents are never disposed or never enabled
to wed—it moves in the direction of reform-
ing an unjustifiable wrong.
* * *
It may be —it probably is—true that
legalisation will not suffice to altogether re-
move the social stigma, yet the tendency must
work in that way. Social customs are slow
to influence, but they are not adamantine.
They move, even if the momentary rate of
their progression be imperceptible. It is
not very important that blind slaves of social
custom plead that the legitimatisation of such
children may lead to disputes in matters of
succession and even to impostures. There
are impostures which are due to the existing
law and customs, just as grievous, and, per-
haps, as frequent. The hard and fast
recognition as legitimate offspring of the
husband, of every child born of a wife
under couverture imposes numerous spurious
heirs upon society. No hard and fast rule
can regulate such matters with certainty.
The only thing that is certain is that every
child has a father and mother, and that
morally- we say morally—it is proper that
the laws should recognise the rights of help-
less children to participation in the provision
made by parents for the children they beget.
The Bill now in question might be improved
were it to affirm that every child born of a
woman should share in her separate estate,
in the event of her dying intestate. But a
valuable step will have been gained if it be
carried into law even with its present limited
proposal that children begotten of unmarried
parents shall be legitimatised in the event of
the subsequent marriage of those parents.
Wanted—A Democratic Daily Paper.
A great —possibly the great—weakness of the
Australian Democratic party is the want of a
vigorous city daily to represent its views and
disseminate its opinions. At the present
moment there is not one paper in Australia—
we doubt if there is one in any part of the
world—which even remotely resembles the
article required. The want cannot be supplied
by any ordinary weekly newspaper, for the
public insists on getting its supply of news
daily—or oftener ; and along with the news it
gets the lies and misrepresentations of the
capitalistic proprietary, so that the work of a
democratic weekly is chiefly to counteract, to
the best of its ability, the insidious falsehoods
which have soaked into the public intelligence
during the seven previous days. Still less can
it be supplied by any of the labour organa, for
they appeal only to the class which is already
converted to democratic views, and—simply
because they are labelled as labour organs—are
unread by the class from which the democracy
wants to make converts. The sort of publi-
cation required is one which, like the Age,
Daily Telegraph, or Courier, has command
of all the sources of information in the five
continents, and can supply to the full
the public craving for knowledge of all
current events, and which, at the same
time, will present that information from a
Democratic point of view instead of from an
exclusively Conservative standpoint. News is
an indispensable commodity, like tea or tobacco
or any other article of merchandise which is
sold by the alleged lb., and when the buyer of
this indispensable commodity is compelled to
take along with it the interested representa-
tions, or misrepresentations, of one political
party, that party obviously has a unique oppor-
tunity for making converts. The situation
would be just the same if the Catholic Church
controlled the entire water-supply of Melbourne
or Sydney, and with every bucket-full that was
delivered gave an impassioned exhortation in
support of its own doctrines. Almost every-
body ends by believing, more or less, if he only
hears one side of the case often enough, and
never, by any chance, hears the other side.
# « *
Not only is there no powerful Democratic
daily paper in Australia, but there is no pre-
sent prospect of any such paper coming into
existence. Many Australian dailies have
started as Democratic organs, but one of two
alternative fates always swallowed them up—
either they remained poor and Democratic and
“ went broke,” or else they prospered and grew
rich and were Democratic no longer. The pro-
cess of conversion was always the same. The
radical paper denounced land monopoly till the
proprietor grow wealthy enough out of the
profits of his denunciation to buy an estate of
his own, and then it cursed all land reformers
with a great curse, and urged that they should
be suppressed as enemies of the State. It
opposed usury until the proprietor became the
owner of many bank shares, and wanted 25 pet
cent, dividends. It objected to the grinding
down of wages to starvation point till the time
came when the owner had many employes and
wanted to grind them down for his own profit.
It supported unionism till the fat man ..I the
head of affairs found that the use of cheap
blackleg labour made a great difference in the
annual dividend. It advocated Republicanism
till the boss became a “ representative citizen,”
and had the entree of Government House, and
obtained admission to “ loyal ” and aristocratic
circles, and saw a possible title looming in the
distance. When these things come to the
newspaper proprietor his Democratic journal
becomes coarsely and brutally Conservative,
and the organ of the People turns traitor just
at the time when the support and assistance of
the People has placed it in a position to -advo-
cate their cause to advantage. And when
these things do not come, the Democratic paper
goes bankrupt. There is an end to the popular
organ in either case.
# * *
Having prospered and turned renegade, the
successful paper becomes a mighty power
in the cause of Property. It and the others
of its kind have control, to all intents and
purposes, of the Parliamentary reports,
for the official Hansard is read by no one,
and it either omits all speeches which tell
powerfully in support of any Democratic
principle, or else it carefully leaves out all the
facts and publishes nothing but an incoherent
jumble, after which it comments strongly on
the imbecility and folly of the speakers, and
refers to its own lying report for confirmation.
It elaborately polishes up the orations delivered
in the Conservative interest, and converts the
shapeless maunderings of some wheezy imbecile
into a powerful and effective deliverance. It
enlarges every meeting of 40 or 50 obscure
bigots into a great and influential demonstra-
tion, and planes down the largest Democratic
gathering into an assemblage of 12 or 13 brutal
anarchists, or else briefly alludes to it as a
“ riot.” It publishes enthusiastic letters—
written in the office signed “Pro Bono
Publico ” in defence of its own views, and
smothers the answers thereto in the waste-
paper basket, thereby leaving the impression
that the assertions of its alleged correspondents
were unanswerable. It suppresses the names
of bankrupts, drunks, brutal assault offenders,
seducers, and divorces belonging to the
party of Property, and publishes in large
type those who belong to the party
of Labour. When an inebriated workman
throws a brick in the course of a public-
house disturbance it invariably heads the
report, “Outrage by a Unionist,” until it
creates an impression that trades unionism is
synonymous with outrages ; when a wealthy
and heartless swindler is sent to gaol for some
callous fraud in connection with a bogus bank it
never, by any chance, heads the report, “ Con-
viction of a Capitalist,” or, “Inhumanity by a
member of the Employers’ Union,” so the fact
that capitalism and robbery arc equally
synonymous is entirely overlooked. It distorts
or invents cablegrams in support of its own
party, and suppresses those which tend to cast
discredit on that party. And, in addition to
all this, it supplies public opinion ready made
in its leading articles, which are often marvels
of ingenious falsehood, garbled statistics, lying
inferences, and facts which never took place.
There is hardly an enterprise on earth which
requires more capital than the establishment of
a large daily paper, and as the natural corollary,
the daily paper is a capitalistic monopoly of
the most incurable type.
« * #
There is a divinity which hedges in the big
city paper, compared to which that which
hedges in a king is a small affair and of no
account. Very few people even realise that the
average paper, apart from mere news, is only
an epitome of one man’s opinions—that the
man whose opinions it expresses is, in
most cases, only a successful advertising
agent—and that the views of a successful
advertising agent are of no more value to any-
one save himself than those of a prosperous
sewing - machine importer or time - payment
furniture man. A daily journal grows rich, not
on its circulation, but on its advertisements ;
therefore, the pushing tradesman who has the
purely bagman instinct of getting advertise-
ments is the most successful newspaper pro-
prietor, while the mere literary genius is almost
always a failure, inasmuch as he doesn’t get
advertisements. And the printed sentiments of
the bagman who calls himself a Gazette or an
Advertiser, are not one whit more pure or
unselfish than those of the bagman who simply
calls himself John Smith. But the world
listens to the bagman who calls himself a
Gazette, and learns, through ceaseless itera-
tion, to regard him as a political authority, and
the free press of the nineteenth century is
merely the aggregate assertions of many bag-
men, each of whom has his own axe to grind,
and the whirring of the grindstone is what goes
by the name of journalistic literature.
* * •
The demand for a consistently radical daily
paper in, at least, one of the great Australian
cities is sufficiently apparent ; unfortunately,
the difficulties in the way of its establishment
are equally conspicuous. A large capital is re-
quired ; something like £20,000 is probably not
an excessive estimate, even under the most
extremely favourable circumstances, and more
than one Australian daily absorbed three or
four times that amount before it became
a dividend-paying property. This sum could
certainly be raised by the labour unions,
but even then the difficulties are only begin-
ning. If the paper is owned by the unions its
influence would be enormously diminished by
that very circumstance. That dull, ox-eyed
thing known as the general public seldom re-
cognises that the great city daily is inevitably
the organ of Capital simply because no one can
own such a property without being a capitalist;
but it would probably be sufficiently intelligent
to recognise the obvious fact that a paper
owned by the labour unions must be the dis-
tinctive organ of Labour. Therefore, while
failing to perceive that the existing papers
must lie in the interests of Conservatism, it
would give the new journal all possible credit
for lying in the interests of Democracy.


Further, a paper run by the unions would have
some thousands of masters, and in the multi-
tude of masters there is ruin ; unless its control
were entirely vested in a small council,.and then
it would probably degenerate, as things are now
managed, into a means of booming the members
of the council into Parliament. It would be in
danger of becoming blindly partisan and thereby
losing all influence outside a very narrow circle.
The capitalistic print which is controlled by
one master generally gets up some shadow of a
reputation for independence by occasionally
condemning its own party on some trivial point,
but the radical organ which had some thousands
of bosses would have to support its party
through thick and thin, else some of its
many conductors would insist on calling it to
account. Also, the editorship would probably
go to the most vociferous delegate in the
unions, and the loudest stump-orator would
be entrusted with the business management,
and the result would be financial disaster. And
if, as an alternative system, the enterprise were
started by a company, the capital of which was
subscribed among the unionists, then the shares
would gradually drift into the hands of specu-
lative capitalists, and under their control the
new Democratic organ would sink into the same
Conservative rut as those which went before it.
Also, as a final alternative, if it were owned by
a single proprietor, it would either remain
Democratic and die of poverty, or else prosper
and become an agency for promoting the private
interests of the bloated sweater whose cogno-
men was on the imprint.
# * *
These area few —only a few—of the difficul-
ties in the way of creating a daily paper which
would be the distinctive organ of the people,
instead of merely that of bricks and mortar,
and banks, and bulky overdrafts, and secret
compositions of one-halfpenny in the £, and
similar forms of Capital. Another, and
probably a more effective device would
he to buy up gradually and silently—if
the virtue" of silence is not alto-
gether extinct in the Democratic councils—a
commanding interest in one of the journals
already existing, and thus acquire control of a
paper whose machinery is already in full
working order. But, in any case, the fact
remains that a radical daily print is the greatest
want of the Democratic party in Australia, and
until they possess one their progress will be
slow and exceedingly difficult. The capitalistic
press is just such an incubus as was the
mediaeval Church —as intolerant, as overbear-
ing, as unprogressive, and fully as arrogant in
its assertion of its own infallibility. In the old
days the Church owned the souls of the people;
in'the present age the daily press does its
utmost to own them instead. The change is
doubtless for the better, but it is not very
much for the better. If the mediaeval Church
had been quoted on the stock exchange, and
had thus been amenable, even in the smallest
degree, to public opinion, there would be prac-
tically nothing to choose between the two insti-
tutions.

Twin Horrors: The Australian and the
Chinaman.
The two appended horrors reached this office
o.i the same day. They both relate to the
administration of justice ; one, from the Twen-
tieth Century, is a picture of Chinese justice
as dealt out by the governing leper intheFlowery
Land ; the other, From two Melbourne papers—
the Standard and Herald —is the Australian
article in all its purity. We tossed up to see
which should go first, and the Chinese horror
won
Ih3 judges were mild, good-looking men in the prime
of life. The one who directed the tortures had one of
the most benignant faces I have ever seen. His voice was
low, soft, sweet, and kind, and, when ordering the tor-
tures, sounded like a benediction. When I came in, a
pirate who refused to testify was undergoing torture.
His back and loins were one mass of putrid, foetid sores,
the result of the beatings he had received in the lower
courts through which he had passed. His arms were
tightly corded to the transverse beam of a cross, his
knees resting on the stone floor. A heavy bamboo pole
was laid across his legs, between the calves and the knees.
In this position two heavy soldiers teetered across his
legs, one on each end of the pole; at each teeter the
cords, the flesh, and the bones would crunch, and
wring unwilling moans and cries of agony from the
tortured criminal. It was horrible, it was sickening,
to see the anguished sweat roll from him; to see every
muscle and each fibre of his naked, mangled body quiver
with the hideous pain. He endured this fiendish torture
for half an hour, when his dank head fell helplessly on his
corded arm. He had become insensible and was released
not in mercy, but to save his strength to suffer another
time. He never spoke. He received no sympathy, even
from the coolies who carried him off ; I noticed one of
them angrily jerk at his cue, to straighten up his insen-
sible head. The Judges smiled, smoked, and drank their
tea. Another witness was suspended from a horizontal
bar by his big toes and thumbs. He hung but a short
time when he signified his willingness to testify. He
threw himself abjectly on his face before the judges, but
his answers did not suit them, and he was seized again,
stretched out on his back, and beaten on the shin
bones with bamboos. When questioned again he was
caught tripping, and the angelic-faced judge coomgly
ordered him twenty blows on the mouth with the
leather paddle. Instantly his arms were seized
behind him and twisted, his cue grasped by another
attendant to hold his head in position, while the soldier
with the paddle administered ten resounding blows on
each side of the mouth, at every blow calling off the
number with the voice of a stentor. The witness was now
unable to testify ; his mouth was a swollen and bleeding
mass, the blood trickling down his neck and breast. In
this garb of woe he was led off with a chain around his
neck. The whole affair was indescribably slimy and cold-
blooded, and impressed me like a hideous nightmare
dream of the Inquisition. I next visited a prison. When
I stepped inside the barred door, the interior was so dark
that at first I could see nothing, and the stench was all
but intolerable. As I recovered myself, and my eyes
gradually became accustomed to the darkness, I grew
conscious of swarms of spectres with famine-stricken
features, their necks encircled by large board collars,
about three feet square, thrusting their grimy, skinny
arms through the iron bars, soliciting alms in whispers
that sounded like the hissing of a myriad of serpents.
The floor and only bedding of this dolesome realm of
darkness was damp, filth-envenomed straw, while along
the roof, bloated, hideous spiders crawled ghoul-like, with
hairy, uncanny feet.
The Australian horror comes next; it is a
picture of “ flogging day ” at Pentridge prison.
The Standard man remarks that he was
“ privileged ”to be present. Some people have
curious ideas about privilege. He explains
that in exercising his blessed privilege he found
it advisable to stand close to the wall else “ the
blood-sodden tails of the instrument ” might
have got into his eye. And after these and a
few other preliminaries, which are much the
same in both papers, we get right down to the
horror i« all its nakedness :
At the first stroke he groaned and shivered, and the
severity of the infliction was such as to draw blood. His
groans and appeals for mercy and to the medical officer
to stay the punishment were something terrible to listen
to, even by those acci stomed to such scenes. At the
truth stroke the prisoner showed signs of collapsing, and
the medical officer slopped the flogging and instructed
the hospital warder to give him a drink of water. The
order was obeyed, but the man could scarcely swallow it.
A few seconds and the signal was given by the medical
officer to “go on with the punishment.” On his being
released the man was unable to stand, and fell across
the breast-plate of the triangles, the blood flowing
copiously down his back. Jones, assisted by some of the
warders, held him up, and the wet clolh was placed On
his shoulders, but he was so faint and weak that he had
to be assisted to his cell, where he swooned away. . .
A hoarse howl of pain and anguish issued from the lips as
Barker’s punishment started. The fellow struggled
frightfully in the toils. He screamed and squirmed as the
lash did its work, raising at every fall nine corrugated
welts, that sent a thrill of agony through his half-
suspended frame. Alternately he asked for pity and
prayed for breath. He implored the angels to interfere
on his behalf, but the angels heard not his prayer.
“ Fifteen,” called the warder. “How many?” shouted
the victim, momentarily recovering himself. “ Five
more, Oh God!” and he resigned himself to the worst.
When he was released a cool wet rag was placed upon his
blood-stained shoulders, and picking up his arrow-branded
garments he made off to his cell like a whipped cur. . .
Ryan’s turn came next, The body hangs limply by the
wrists, the toes barely touching the ground. The “ cat ”
had hardly whistled through the air till the fellow’s
resolve failed him. The first cut brought a piercing
scream of anguish. The skin was tender and seemed to
frizzle up at each successive blow like a burnt shaving.
At last the blood of the guilty wretch began to trickle
from the opening wounds, and as he writhed and prayed,
the untiring hand behind kept at its work. “Is there no
justice on earth, Oh 1 Lord?” the sufferer demanded, but
the only answer was another cut. “God pity me, a
suffering innocent,” he called aloud piteously, “ is there
no mercy?” Then, almost exhausted, he rested his face
upon his arm and sank his teeth deeply into his own flesh
that he might the better resist the falling blows. Only
15 ! To him they seemed a thousand, and a year in
falling.
And so on. There they are, the Pagan horror
and the Christian horror side by side. One is
about as good as another. You pay your money
and take your horror.
The Confidence Trick.
The other night, Sir Bryan O’Loghlen
agitated the disreputable Legislative Assembly
of Victoria by moving that the present Govern-
ment does not possess the confidence of the
House. The same idea has been aired several
times during the present session—aired, indeed,
until it is too dry for further discussion—and
at the end of each wasted period of crisis the
“ins” have remained as much in, whilst
Gillies has remained as much “out” as ever.
O’Loghlen’s motion resulted in nothing save a
further unnecessary proof that thepresent House
is a den of corruption, whose confidence no
high-minded Ministry could expect to possess
for a single hour. It is an unblushing fact that
the cardinal sin of the Shiels Government—
the sin which has damaged the credit of Aus-
tralia at large, and done a lasting mischief to
Victoria in particular—ranks as a redeeming
virtue amongst the Parliamentary mob. The
country despises Shiels for his folly in having
allowed himself to be annexed by Graham
Berry, and thus practically incapacitated from
prosecuting the openly-accused persons with
whose alleged rascality the name of Berry is
so awkwardly entangled. In all matters per-
taining to Matthew Davies the Government
has lost the confidence of everybody except the
House, but in other respects the Government
seems to be trying to do its duty with sufficient
seriousness of purpose. Therefore, decent,
thinking people outside are not sorry to see the
present disgraceful state of affairs continued
in preference to another state which
would probably be still more disgraceful.
The “ out ” gang are as deep in the Daviesian
mire as the “Crown” itself, and until they
declare themselves in favour of an honest pro-
secution policy there can be no tittle of reason
for wishing them success in any of their periodi-
cal attacks upon the Treasury benches. Shiels
and Berry are at least prepared to tax and
retrench at a time when taxation and re-
trenchment are absolutely necessary. The
other people could only make matters worse by
doing exactly the opposite if they got the
chance. Duncan Gillies, as a restorer of the
public finances, is certainly not the thing to be
desired, whilst Duncan, if a defender of cronk
balance-sheets, couldn’t possibly prove more
zealous and reliable than the briefless barrister
who now encourages Matthew Davies to keep
his pecker up. So the House rejected the
O’Loghlen motion by a fair working majority.
Had Shiels evinced any symptoms of institut-
ing criminal proceedings against Davies and
his tentacles—a possibility not to be entertained
so long as Berry sticks to office—he might
have suffered a defeat last week. Shiels is
still sound on the great Davies question, how-
ever, and the House believes in the old proverb
that it’s best to leave bad alone.
The Glorious Gag.
Frederic Harrison, the Positivist apostle,
does some straight talking in a late Fort-
nightly on the Irish Home Rule Bill. Ihe
article is as brilliant as it is chock-full of sense.
A long time ago, when the English Government
were inventing all sorts of patent improvements
in the closure system in order to gag down the
onposition to the Coercion Bill, Parnell cyni-
cally thanked them for perfecting a weapon
which the Home Rule party would find handy
when it was their turn to shoot. It is their
turn now, and Harrison points out what a
useful little implement the gag is. Without it
the Home Rule majority of only 40 would be
helpless. But with it, this is what they can do.
Brin" in the Bill; give six weeks to consider it;
then°four nights for the second reading debate,
and three weeks for committee, with the closure
chopping down like a guillotine every
hour. If amendments multiply obstructively,
closure them. No compromise, no mangling the
scheme ; the bill, the whole bill, and nothing
but the bill. Make it part of the Liberal pro-
gramme that rejection of the bill by the Lords
will be followed by a movement for the sup-
pression of the Lords. Send it back after each
rejection, without debate ; and after each
rejection strike out such clauses as may be
specially designed for the advantage of the
Lords and their friends. Finally, if necessary,
swamp the House with new peers ; march
them in like a regiment of life-guards to vole
for the bill. And if the Queen refuses to create
the peers, then the nation, thundering at the
door of the House of Lords, will simply have
to turn their attention to another place. “We
must one day,” says Harrison, “ get rid of the
whole of the idiotic gold-stick and court-dress
business—send them to Madame Jussauds
waxwork show.” This is refreshing reading,
and it is good for us in Australia to keep in
mind that the gag will be much appreciated
when the capitalistic ring in the Legislature is
only the turbulent and braggard minority that
it already is outside.
The Case of the Port Glasgow.
The case of the crew of the Port Glasgow, a
vessel which recently arrived in Sydney under
very peculiar circumstances, is another evidence
of the strabismussed law which is served out to
the seafaring community. According to the
statements of the second and third mates, the
cook and carpenter', and the entire crew-, Cap-
tain M'Kinnon, who commanded the vessel,
was accustomed, whenever bad weathet
came on, to bolt for a place of refuge
down below until the storm was over.
In other words, the accusation brought
against him by the ship’s company is that
he abandoned his post under circumstances
of extreme danger, and that his incapacity or
cowardice, or something else made it absolutely
necessary to supersede him in order to prevent
the Port Glasgow taking a short cut to the
bottom. He was practically deposed from his
command accordingly, and we have before us
the admitted fact that all the officers save one
joined in the movement. On arriving in
Sydney, the crew and officers, with the
exception of the first mate as above-men-
tioned. lodged a complaint against the cap-
tain, and the matter is to be “ inquired
into.” Also, the captain lodged a complaint
against them, and they were promptly sentenced
by Magistrate Smithers to a month’s gaol for
“ disobedience to orders.” T he case, therefore,
stands thus : The man who is accused by 16
witnesses of a particularly gross offence is at
liberty, while the 16 men who are accused by
one witness —himself under suspicion—of a
comparatively small offence, committed, as they
allege, to provide for the safety of their own
lives and to preserve a valuable vessel from
destruction, are sent to prison. The charge
against the captain was the one first advanced,
and yet the law, instead of dealing with it
first, allows that officer, on the strength of his
own bald and unsupported declaration that the
said charge is unfounded, to arrest all the
witnesses against him and put them out
of the way in a prison, Having thus de-
cided, in effect, that the crew’s charge is al-
together groundless, the courts, when they are
fully rested, are going to inquire into it, and
resolve whether the captain was sober enough
to give the orders which the crew is alleged to
have disobeyed, whether these orders were not
of such a character that obedience to them
would have caused the loss of the ship and all
on board, and whether the crew and the
officers who took part with them, did not
really, by their “ disobedience,” save their
commander from destruction ; but meanwhile
Smithers, P.M., settles the whole case on his
own authority, by sending all the witnesses for
the prosecution to the lockup as common
criminals. If the case had not been a nautical
one, and the witnesses for the prosecution had
been “influential citizens” instead of a crowd
of humble sailors—say, if the case had been
that of Abigail awaiting trial, and Magistrate
Smithers had gaoled all the Crown witnesses
for perjury, on Abigail’s unsupported evidence,
before the trial came on—what, we wonder,
would have happened to Smithers, P.M. ?
Yet the two cases would be exactly similar.
The crew of the Port Glasgow undertake to
swear that the captain’s conduct made their
action absolutely necessary, and the magistrate
decides in advance that that evidence is false,
and acts accordingly. Surely the Minister of
Justice will interfere, pending a full enquiry
by the Marine Board.
That great and good man, W. L. Abbott*
writes: —
The bogus-bank cases and the Broken Hill cases stand
on the same ground, and should be dealt with in the
same way. Heavy sentences have been inflicted in the
public interest to put an end to public evils, and the evil
inflicted on the community by the illegal actions of the
unionist conspirators is more far-reaching and damaging
than that inflicted by the bogus bank-conspirators.
Financiers of the Abbott brand, you see, don’t
lose their money in scaly little banks like
Abigail’s, so they can afford to look on institu-
tions of that kind with a forbearing eye. And
in the bright lexicon of Capital it is more sinful
to try to prevent a big silver company breaking
its agreement for its own profit than it is to
get, by prayer and false pretences, the last
crust of the widow on deposit at 10 percent.,
and then swindle her out of both it and the
percentage.
A few weeks ago (in its issue of loth October),
The Bulletin urged upon the Australian labour
unions the advisability of establishing co-opera-
tive farms, where the distressed unionist, while
waiting for better times, could always obtain food
and shelter for himself and family, and possibly
a small Avage, in exchange for his labour. Such
an enterprise, it was pointed out, Avould not
only be self-supporting, but, under anything
like sane management, would yield a handsome
profit to the union funds, while it Avould stop
the perpetual and ruinous drain in support of
strikers and locked-out or unemployed unionists.
Since the publication of that article, I he
Bulletin learns, on good authority, that the
Salvationists in Victoria are already doing, for
the cdory of the big drum and General Booth,
what the workers will not do in their own
interest. The Salvation farm at Pakenham
takes in the unemployed in the sacred name of
charity and works him about 12 hours per
diem for all he is worth. He gets no wages
the first month —nothing but a hard corner to
sleep in and his food, which consists chiefly
of bread and treacle and hallelujah. r l he
second month he gets 2s. a \yeek, and
after that, by industry, strict sobriety and
prayer, he may rise through slow grada-
tions till he reaches the maximum of os. a.
m eek —out of which he is expected to con-
tribute something to the plate. This proceeding
is called “charity.” The profits which, under
this system of cheap Chinese labour, are large,
will probably go in the end towards swamping
the Australian labour-market with “ reformed”
and diseased criminals in red shirts ; and the
workers, despite their 12 hours per day and
their Kanaka wages, are paupers in their own
eyes and in the eyes of the people who take
them in. Why have the unions not sufficient
'energy or Originality to start a dozen —or fifty—
such farms, and provide for their own unem-
ployed-, and be their own sweaters, and abolish
the “ charitable ” element hi the business, and
annex the profits themselves '! The Salva-
tionists have intelligence enough to run the
Enterprise at a profit; do the unions seriously
assert that they have less intelligence and
coherence than the fanatics who plough thtough
the grime at the tails of the hook-nosed Booth?
The Argus reviews the four great Australian
strikes with a bald partiality calculated to
deceive nobody. It shows that in each instance
the men struck because they were too pros-
perous and happyj and because they had too
little to do and the principles of unionism were
too generously recognised by their placable
masters. The four strikes have been won by
combined capital assisted by the perennial
blackleg, and the Argus parades its moral: —
If the unions so widen their basis as to allow all workers
to join they will never again he able to assert such extra-
vagant claims as they have done in the past; if they do
not, it matters little what their pretensions may be, for
they will never he able to maintain them.
So the fat man is comforted—he is safe in either
extremity. But the Argus ignores the after-
math, or fails to see that these conquests have
bred in the men of labour a bitterness that
promises more for genuine reform than did all
the strikes, and is a greater menace to the
“ rights ” of capital than the extremest tenets
of the unions. The employers, not content
with victory, must get up on the barn and crow,
and point to “ the shaved and cropped and
ironed ” Sleath. They have almost succeeded
in convincing the workers of the hopelessness
of fighting on the old lines. Above all things,
capital should have striven to keep labour from
annexing its pet particular weapons —“law n
order,” that is law to order.
.*— '
The case of John Hurley, ex-M.P., accused
and acquitted of conspiracy in connection with
the Australian Banking Co., may be that of
any other N.S. W. citizen charged with a
criminal offence. The preliminary proceedings
at the Water Police Court lasted eleven days,
except on two or three of which the accused
were relegated to a small, bare cell during the
court’s meal-interval. Lunch was sent by
friends, but the officials withheld knives, forks
and spoons ; so defendants sat on the cell-floor
and ate with their fingers. Fresh bail was
demanded daily; one afternoon bail for Mr,
Hurley was by mischance not forthcoming ;
he was put into Black Maria with several
dirty, drunken, cursing hags, and conveyed to
Darlinghurst prison, where he was at once
divested of all valuables, including bis studs
and sleeve-links ; even his eyeglasses and pocket
handkerchief were taken, and he was forced
into a scalding bath, He passed the first
night in a bitterly cold cell, and next morning
he had a severe cold. Notwithstanding, he was
stripped, photographed, examined—ordered to
open his mouth so that the officials might count-
his “ tayth,” At certain tiroes he was placed
in the gaol-yard with the convicted prisoners,
and the distress he thereby suffered was aggra-
vated by further official insult. “Hurley,
stand upright !” “ Take your hands out of your
pockets!” “ Salute the Governor!” In address-
ing the jury he complained of the gaol treat-
ment, and contended that no man should be
disgraced and humiliated prior to conviction.
The Judge and Crown Prosecutor sympathised
with him and promised investigation. On 18th
October he forwarded a written complaint to
the Minister for Justice. He has not received
a reply, but has learnt privately that an official
enquiry was held, and that his allegations were
denied. He says he can prove them at a sworn
enquiry.

Dear Bulletin, —Considering the great dis’
tress at present existing in all parts o 1
Australia, and the vast numbers of men unem’
ployed, I would suggest that a system of State’
aided emigration to England should be adopted
as the best available remedy. In that country
nearly half the arable land is out of cultivation,
and consequently there should be a good open-
ing for the submerged tenth of Australia to
settle there. The climate is bearable, aud the
so il_ U nlike the deserts of interior Australia—
is exceedingly fertile. If the British Govern-
ment were approached on the subject it might
possibly be willing to allot much of the
country now lying idle to Australian settlers.
At all events, it should do so, for England
owes Australia a vast debt of gratitude, inas-
much as this country has paid a heavy rate of
interest on great sums of British money, which
might otherwise have lain idle, and has served
as a refuge for much British human rubbish,
and has cheerfully paid large salaries to many
impecunious and useless British officials, who
might otherwise have been reduced to serious
straits. If the Government won’t take the
matter un, I would suggest that General Booth
should be approached on the subject.—Yours,
etc,, T.S. __________ ____________
O'Loghlen’s judgeship would be the worst

The “ English Rose,” which was staged
on Saturday at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), is a new
and somewhat hazardous departure in Irish
drama. The base informer has been omitted, and
when the community gets its second wind the
probabilities are that it will resent the loss of
that old-established family iniquity. All the
other materials which make up the Irish drama
are present, but they can’t compensate for the
loss of the informer. The decayed Irish gentle-
man, whose pedigree descends all the way from
King Nial of the Showers or King Malaehi
O’Grady of the olden time, and who used to
own all the land forninst Ballydobbin, is
there ; so is the Sassenach who now holds
the estate and overshadows the ruined towers
of The OTlooligau, and the praste, and the
wicked agent who is short in his cash, and the
drunken squireen, and the Sassenach’s daughter
who is in love with the Irish gintleman’s son—the
latter being a high-spirited being who seemingly
does nothing except stay around and occasionally
lament the decadence of his race, and the
“ natural ” —the inspired idiot who infests every
Irish drama and bowls out the informer or the
agent, generally with the assistance of the man
who keeps the shebeen. And, these elements being
present, it is only necessary to mention that the
Sassenach is shot by the squireen
at the instance of the agent,
and the son of the decayed
Irish gentleman is found guilty
of the crime, and the squireen
imparts the horror to the
praste under seal of confession,
and the prisoner is rescued
by the peasanthry, and after-
wards run down by the wicked
agent, but the latter is bowled
out at the last moment by the
“ natural ” and the broguey
policeman, and arrested in a
bell-topper amid the yells of a
community which is behind
with its rint. There is a con-
siderable sameness about Irish
drama.

Mr. Lionel Rignold, cousin
to our own George, plays the
incongruous element in . the
show, in the shape of a red-
headed welsher from London,
a hack villain with a game-
leg and a shapeless, slab coun-
tenance, who acts as under-
study to the agent. The new-
comer makes this person a
ruffian of much humour, with
a raucous chuckle, and a mouth
that turns sideways towards his
ear —a mixtureof cabman, coster-
monger, tout, spieler, general
horsey man, inflamed gutter-
snipe, and leary cove generally.
On Saturday he took the house
by storm, nevertheless The
Bulletin suspends its judgment.
The Cockney variety of humour
is somewhat hackneyed and
mechanical, and the present
scribe wants to see cousin
Lionel in a character that isn’t
quite so much overdone
before it states definitely that that gentleman
is the equal of brother Bill. Mr. Walter Howe,
as the Irish hero, is not specially brilliant; and
Mr. Cosgrove is a feeble and unconvincing agent
—an individual who tries to be a fiend and only
succeeds in being thin scoundrelgaff, or weak
villain and ginger-beer. Ihe other parts an ley
are many-are all well filled, Messrs. Sass (as the
praste), Cathoart, and Sweeney being particularly
good. Eight beautifully artistic scenes y
Goatcher, Brunton and Hennings, and a steeple-
chase in which two horses gal op recklessly across
the stage are memorable features. Also, Misses-
Henrietta Vatson and Hilda . pong, as the ns
girl and the English one respectively are suf-
ficient incentives tc> hi gamy. Nevertheless when
the author makes the atter offer to die for her
rival, he strikes a feeble and ineffective note.
There are women in plenty who will die for
another ; what we want to find is the woman who
will lend her best umbrella to her rival and go
home with a coptnte heart in the ram.

The tank-devil and submarine conundrum
at Fillis’ Circus, perhaps the most enjoyable
circus Australia has eyer seen, grows mpre
unaccountable as the days roll on. This
mystic personage has taken of late to smoking
under water, and when he sits placidly soak-
ing at the bottom of his tank with his burn-
nig cigar in lus mouth, and grins through the
glass at the audience, lie is a weird what-is-it
and a human cuttle-fish. He also snuffs under
water, and when he has taken several pinches in
his grotto lie generally starts to sneeze furiously
and blows his secluded haunt into foam. he
and the two girls diye down together and
play cards at the gyeen and tile it sea-bottom,
and the professor, apparently, stacks th,e card--,'
or else plants the ace under the sea-weed,
or hides the right bower behind a fish—anyhow,
he always seems to win. And when he plays that
ace lie shakes all over with silent laughter, and
the spectacle of this sodden gnome convulsed with
mirth in the depths of his tank is a solemn affair,
and suggestive of an octopus swindling a crab
down a hundred fathoms deep. The Bulletin
has a fixed conviction that the Professor doesn’t
play a square game in the tank, but as hardly
anybody plays a square game in these days, this
is a mere detail.

JohnGourlay has revived “Milky White,”
at Sydney Garrick, and as there is a good deal of
humour in the tale of the deaf and cantankerous
cowkeeper it will probably last the week.
Also, he has fixed up an after-piece entitled “ The
Belles of the Kitchen,” which is based on the fact
that the family being from home the chief flunkey
and his subordinates take to private theatricals
with hideous results. The most prominent parts
in the performance are allotted to Messrs. Baxter
and Walton, and Miss Flora Hastings as
James, Muggins and Mary Hann, but
The Bulletin’s sympathies are all with
Bella (played by Miss Amy Gourlay), a hard-
driven under-housemaid in a brown frock, who
doesn’t get a decent show anywbere except when
she is allowed to hold up a saucepan to represent
the rising moon in “Romeo and Juliet.” Some
good music comes in here and there, and Miss
Marie Dunoon distinguishes herself by appearing
in about the most abbreviated frock on record,
and a gratifying pair of red stockings. The
season closes this week, and Mr. Gourlay
announces on the bill that he doesn’t want any
benefit. He is the only manager in Australia
who isn’t looking for a benefit these times.

orcheg * tra di , scard ed their fiddles in order to hand
up tokens of esteem with streamers attached. A
p£ tti or a Bernhardt seldom gets a greater night
fc than was enjoyed by M rs. B. last week, nor
did eyer ft theatrical demonstration have a truer
ri of enthusiasm . Whe n the time came for
Pu « veS; q -0 ., to present a glittering diamond star
to “Squire Kate”—-viz., at the conclusion of
Pinero’s play—the whole of the assembled com-
pany might have buried themselves in sweet
things from the florists’shops. Certainly the dis-
play of roses, lilies, and carnations represented
more than .£50,000 at the current fashionable
“composition” rate of one farthing in the thick
’un. It was a touching spectacle when considered
in relation to the financial fakements of several
prominent creatures amongst the audience, who
shouted “ bravo !” oblivious of the fact that they
ought to be languishing in gapl. Purves delivered
an eloquent, honest oration in praise of the lead-
ing lady, telling hey that she had improved
steadily, apd made a name by degree's. Mrs.
Brough, in her turn, didn’t forget to remember
that fortune had been kind to her natural talent
by giving her those opportunities which, by the
way, not every manager’s wife could have turned
to such good account. Both speeches rose above
the benefit average in sincerity and sense, and the
public, who bad expected an interesting occasion,
were not disappointed.
mm*
The appointing of Purves, Q.C., to do the
honours at Mrs. Brough’s benefit was decidedly
significant. Two years ago, there would have
been a mob of representative blatherskites to the
fore. At the present moment, none of the old
gang can face a theatre full of people without fear
of being saluted with howls, so the uninvolved
Purves, supported by the Napoleonic-looking
surgeon Fitzgerald, was deputed to see the function
through.

“A White Lie,” by Sydney Grundy, has
been produced at Melbourne Bijou with the usual
complete success, but its nights will not be long
in the pretty little theatre. This theatrical com-
position wanders about into several keys, with no
clearly defined purpose. There are insuperable
difficulties in the way of discovering which por-
tions of the narrative ought to be taken seriously,
also, the general bewilderment is aggravated 6y
the casual introduction of a tough, inhuman
infant. At the outset, this juvenile promises to
loom large in the midst of maudlin sentiment, hut
presently the little lamb fades into obscurity, and
the plot takes a serio-comic turn, in quite another
direction. A would-be seducer of matrimonial
innocence makes a bold show of front teeth during
the first mile and a half of the journey, after
which he bolts off the course and goeth
no man knows whither. As a social profligate
he is a delusion and a sham, Two married
women in turn seem to tremble in his amorous
presence, yet at the end it transpires that he
wasn’t of the least consequence. Indeed, one of
the aforesaid wives seem never to have been afraid
of the machiavellian johnnie at all, a fact that
doesn’t accord with her agony of mind when her
husband leaves her in charge of their wooden
offspring for a few weeks. “ Come back soon —
O ! come back soon ! ” wails the weeping matron.
Seeing that her George is simply running across
to New York on business, there can be but one
explanation of this wild distress. The lady
ostensibly doubts her ability to hold out against
a long siege by the ill-fated dude. Fond and
clever wives don’t object, without good reason,
to a brief absence of the “ old man ” on a money-
making mission. Aw contraire they like it. Then
why does Mrs. Brough—being devoted to her
stage husband, and callous to the charms of Cates,
the Evil One —attach such tragic significance
to the Mur’kan journey ? Her emotion is
utterly irrelevant to the other events. Either
there must be something wrong with Grundy’s
play, or with the Bijou interpretation of it—-
probably the latter. Mrs. Brough has performed
many of Mrs. Kendal’s characters, but never
before has this winning-wayed actress fallen so
far short of the original. She is nice as the senti-
mental wife, and again nice as the sprightly,
ready-witted grass-widow, and that is all. Her
character doesn’t hang together. She changes her
disposition while the curtain is down between the
first and second acts, and loses, so to speak, the
run of herself behind the scenes. Miss Emma
Temple, as the other married lady, fails to explain
many things, and Cates is only coherent when he
takes up his hat and quits the garish scene. Two
angry men are fossicking after their helpmates in

Titheradge is at home in the old, old part of the
superficially careless husband who goes to sleep on
the sofa and takes care to wake up at the right
time ; but Cecil Ward, as the husband who goes
away to New York, is decidedly out of form.
Probably “A White Lie” will need to be re-
placed by “A Village Priest,” or some other
popular revival before the next issue of The
Bulletin gives this breathing world a fresh fillip.

The Gaiety Company have reached their
last week but one at Melbourne Princess’, and
“ Miss Esmeralda” meets the eternal want. Com-
parisons between the “Miss Esmeralda” of now
and five years ago are not as odious as might he
imagined. Lonnen is the wildest of monks, with
a large fund of energy and a bright display of
humour, which is more various than usual. More-
over, he fias dropped the coster of yore, and sub-
stitutes for that ancient friend a just passable
imitation of the Australian larrikin who sings an
original song with a catchy refrain. Any attempt
on the part of Gaiety burlesque to strike a new
idea deserves earnest encouragement. Bert
Haslem makes a good Hunchback, less agile
than Fred. Storey, but more tuneful and
intense. Courtneidge, Miss Alice Lethbridge,
the volcanic Leamar, Harry Gribbon and some
Others take part in the general triumph, and the
ladies who represent legs, pure and simple, give
ample satisfaction in that respect. Katherine
Foote, the tall, dark creature, disappoints the
public once again by not doing anything, so the
last hope of detecting one grain of meaning in
this special attraction from Europe has now been
abandoned. Katherine was evidently engaged to
do nothing, and she has carried out her contract
to the letter. Miss Clara tylerivale lent a flavour
of novelty to the name part for a week, but
Marion Hood was announced to entirely recover
from her severe illness by last Monday night,
wherefore Marion is now (we presume) appearing
as the one golden link uniting the past and
present of this expensive show.

The Royal was open last Saturday for the
occasion of George Ireland’s benefit, when
“ Clytie ” appealed to the sympathies of a woe-
fully meagre audience. Candour compels one to
admit that “ Clytie ” presents the appearance of
being a painful proceeding at any time. This
time it was unduly harrowing and full of excep-
tional shocks. A gleam of sunshine, in the form
of Miss Harrie Ireland, relieved the horrors of her
father’s benefit, and as an advertisement of this
pretty girl’s ability “Clytie” was not given in
vain.
mm*
The Argus, it seems, discovered that “ the
principal interest in the performance was created
by the first appearance of Miss Harrie Ireland,
who in the title-rdKe exhibited such histrionic
powers that should she be looking forward to a
stage career it must he pronounced one of great
promise. ’ For a debutante she achieved a sur-
prising success.” Veiy kind and encouraging of
that pompous publication to an actress who lias
taken Myra Kemble’s place in comedy (on tour),
and whose delightful playing in “The Bells of
Haselmere,” a few weeks ago, at the same theatre,
had moved The Bulletin to hail her as a rising
star.

Kelly, the manager for Grace Hawthorne, says a London
paper, is eminently proud of the title of champion liar,
“ There are,” he says, “ but three genuine liars extant.
John Rogers is one, and I am the other two.”
When Miss Sedohr Rhodes was being “boomed” at
such a rate before the production of “Incognita,” Horace
Sedger, having heard her rehearse, foresaw that she
would be a failure, and asked Nellie Stewart to alternate
the part with her; but Nellie, says The Bulletin’s cor-
respondent, would have none of it, Aut Ccesar aut
Nullus. It is pretty well known that Miss Rhodes or her
friends have a share in the “ Incognita” venture, andit is
said that Mrs. Bonanza Mackay is one of those who put
up money. Americans do stick to each other. By the
way, Miss Rhodes has a particularly long neck, and some
one has sa d that this accounts for her voice being lost on
the way out.
The position occupied by a certain Sydney musical
critic in dissecting the performances of Organist Wiegand
is pretty well on all-fours with that occupied by Parkes in
the book wherein he attacks the hated rival who now sits
in the seat which the old man thinks bis own by prescrip-
tive right.
A bogus proprietor advertised, in Melbourne, for a
crowd of young ladies for a circus. He got them, or at
all events, their clothes, and made off with their boxes of
effects. Spiegelberg, in Schiller’s “Rauber,” tells magni-
ficently of how they stole all the clothes out of the nuns’
bedrooms, and then roused the convent with an alarm of
fire. How would it be if they robbed the wardrobe of the
Melbourne Princess’s during a performance of “ Esmer-
alda ? ”
Melbourne papers gush a good deal about Lonnen’S
personification of the larrikin in “Miss Esmeralda.”
Lonnen does not personify the larrikin- he is merely-
giving the coster in a “ seemore ” and a “ stiff-rimmer.”
Melbourne Exhibition trustees, after witnessing the
spectacle of two or three teams of women dragging each
other to rags in the tug-of-war business, decided that no
tug shoujd be allowed to last longer than nine minutes.
Considering that a woman, or a man either, can get in-
curable injuries in those insane hauling contests inside of
CO seconds, if he or she only drags hard enough, this
resolution isn’t quite so humane as it looks.
London Figaro relieves its dreary paragraphs with
little pen-and-ink portraits of the kind usually described
as “clever.” That is to say the sketches have an air of
being peculiarly truthful unless you happen to know the
persons they are intended to represent. A striking, free-
drawn “ portrait ” of G. W. Anson appeared in Figaro
the other week, and not one Australian theatre-goer in
ten thousand could ever hope to detect a shadow of a
resemblance between G.W.A. and his “ likeness!”
Mrs. Avins, several times mistakenly obituarised, really
figures at last in the Melbourne mortuary advertisements.
Fifty years ago, a tolerably' popular actress, she was a
repertoire of memories about stage history. “ Boy, thou
hadst a father,” says Shallow to Silence, but sometimes
we forget it.
Mrs. Bernard-Beere says that “ actors in Australia are
more widely experienced than those of the old country,”
which really' means that they- have to work harder than
people who play the same characters for six months at a
stretch in London. Mrs. B. B. was comparing old stagers
like Janies Cathcart and Teddy' Royce with such take-it-
easy gentlemen as Herbert Standing and Marius, neither
of whom is now capable of learning the words of a long-
part within a fortnight.
Marshall Hall, the crank apostle of classical music in
Melbourne, has been crushed in one act by the re-publica-
tion of a Musical Times notice. Marshall Hall cursed
Australia from the giddy' elevation of “a musician accus-
tomed to European artistic circles.” Nowit appears that
a first performance of Marshall Hall music in London was
regarded as a ghastly joke, and however much this
raging professor may have been accustomed to artistic
circles in the “ old world,” the said circles never became
accustomed to the discordance of strange noises which
represents his inspired conception of perfect harmony-.
After these cruel revelations we may expect to hear that
Marshall is tired of living in a heathen land, and yearns
to carry culchaw to some other continent.

Nothing has been heard lately about George Rignold
and brother Bill’s claim to the big Rignault estate (Eng.),
concerning which the papers had so much to say some
time ago. If The Bulletin remembers rightly, there was
a baronetcy hanging to the property, which the vile
usurper, whom George was going to law with, had taken
to himself when he seized the ancestral abode and the
deer-park. George threatened to turn the legal limelight
on these doings, and make the wrongful heir “git” to
slow music at the end of the fifteenth act. The Bulletin
pines to know'.
We hear from London that Willie Wilde hopes to make
his bow to an Australian public as a lecturer under the
aegis of the Much-Travelled. Willie, by the way, and his
missus are now tw-o. The promises made at the altar
have not been fulfilled, so far as cash is concerned.
Courtice Pounds has left D’O.vley Carte, who pays
badly, and is a hard task master. " For years he paid
Grossmith only 20 guineas a week ; then George went
into the entertainment line on his own account, and has
pocketed nearly £40,000 clear since. £4O a week would
have kept him at the Savoy. Such is luck.
A London correspondent to The Bulletin : A man who
knows all about such things tells me that it is true exor-
bitant salaries are signed for by managers employing in-
different actors and actresses,"and appear in the w'eekly
pay-sheet, but, as a fact, it is in many' cases under-
stood that the sum set down is never handed over, as
a separate memo is signed accepting a smaller screw. The
fairy tales put about as to So-and-so getting a huge salary
are merely by way- of advt., or to enable the actress, or
actor, or singer, as the case may be, to get better terms
from some unsophisticated Australian or American
manager—if such a being exists.
Robert Cunningham, brother of “Brains” C., of the
Argus, has been on tour in England as principal tenor in
the “ Sultan of Mocha,” in wdiich he has made a big
artistic success. He has a fine voice and has taken much
pains to cultivate it. He meditates bringing a concert co.
to Australia, which would include Belle Cole, But all
depends on the Much-Travelled.

In a Maoriland capital, an amateur opera co. had been
organised, and “ Pinafore ” was the piece. The town
resounded \yitb solos and choruses. From the counting-
house and the coal-cellar came the piercing strains.
Among these who bad it badly was the choir of the chief
church. One day, the minister and the choir stood by a
yawning grave, prepared for the mortal clay of a much-
respected member of the kirk session. The minister was
visibly moved, and, as a big lump rose in his throat, he
said, “ We shall miss our brother from his usual haunts.”
“ And so will his sisters and ids cousins and his aunts,
his sisters and his cousins, whom he reckons up by
dozens, and his aunts.” And as the choir fished up their
insensible pastor from the yawning chasm, it suddenly
dawned on them, that they had mistaken the voice of

shot another dead, during “ La Traviata,” and it was over

Greer shot Soudry and Mrs. Greer, during the “Hugue-

In another portion of this issue will be found a portrait
of Miss Bella Bashall, who has been specially engaged by
Mr. Coppin to perform the Serpentine Dance at Melbourne
Theatre Royal during the pantomime season. Miss
Bashall is the daughter of the late Joseph Bashall, an
English comedian, and is a of the stage, she
having played child-parts at the age of five years. She
has approvedly appeared in various roles in the English,
Scottish, and Irish provinces, and will be remembered as
having made a great success at Sydney Garrick of the
Serpentine Dance, which she introduced to Australia.
■ Bland Holt’s company had a good season at Newcastle,
where it was disbanded. Two people have won their

energetic representative.
At the recent Goulburn (N.S. IV.) rose-show, there was a
beauty which attracted the attention of all the florists
present, but it was unnamed, and nobody seemed
able to classify it. When the general attention was drawn
to some other part of the show, a demure maiden hung
upon its stay-stick a paper bearing the legend—“Ta-ra-
ra-boom-de-ay !” When the gardeners trooped back the
grave-eyed maid watched them eagerly transfer the
“name” to their pocket-books, one of them observing
that it was “ probably Greek,” and that he’d order some
“cuttings of it at once from Sydney.”

A Sydney newspaper man was stopped at the door of a
theatre the other night by a new doorkeeper who didn’t
recognise him. He stated that he was Mr. ,of the
Howler, but the official was still uncertain and wanted
proof, so he felt in all his pockets for a card, and dis-
covered to his disgust that he had come out without one.
But he found documentary evidence of another kind, and
when the doorkeeper had inspected a pawn-ticket which
set forth that Mr. , of the Howler, had left hiswatch-
chain with one Isaac Moses as security for an advance of
305., he passed the applicant in without further objection.
Titheradge, according to a Victorian paper, is an
enthusiastic sportsman, though he doesn’t often hit the
object he aims at. Once he and a well-known cricketer
went out shooting, and both fired at the same bird. The
bird fell, and before picking it up they stopped to quarrel
violently as to which of them killed it. After arguing in
a cold puddle for a quarter of an hour they finally decided
to toss for it, so Titheradge threw up a sovereign and it
never came down again. They both groped for it among
the slush for nearly half an hour, and at the end of that
time the cricketer told Titheradge he had better take the
dashed bird and be done with it. By this time, however,
they had both forgotten where the bird fell; they spent
the rest of the morning looking for it, but it never turned
up. Titheradge isn’t a lucky sportsman, evidently.
A Yankee negro showman swallows indiscriminately old
shoe-soles, charcoal, coal, the “wicks” of electric arc
lights, bits of smashed crockery, clay pipes, &c. Next he
takes the chimney of a lighted paraffin lamp and starts
chewing it hot, like a lolly-stick, after which he drinks up
all the paraffin in the lamp. Then he takes off shoes and
socks and dances a weird fandango round a stage strewn
with broken bottles and smashed china.

“In every American oily I visited,” says Max 0 RelP
“somebody would drive me round the localities where
the rich men lived. Then he would tell me their bio-

lost them. Then he went to Chicago, made 500,000

made 1 000,000 dollars, and lost them. I always stopped
him there.” says Max. “I would say: ‘ Show- me a
Frenchman who ever made one dollar and didn t keep
hold of it for ever afterwards.’ They had all been at work
all their lives making millions of dollars and losing them,
and they all had an initial in the middle of their names.
We wonder if Max ever heard the story of the American

BJ6 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, Nov. 30, 1892,
Mv Dear Moorabinda, —
Gossip about the past-and-gone banquet to Lord
Precedence Scott and the reception to Lady Scott hints
at the latter function not being so lively as it might have
been. There was only a pinch of guests, and these
showed such decided signs of wanting to go away after
half-an-hour, that members of the committee were heard
imploring people not to leave before eleven 1 Indeed, so
visible was the boiling spirit that one or two of the most
deeply bored ladies who were determined to make off
were caught ere they could get to the door and bribed by
the promise (ultimately fulfilled, too) of a bottle of fizz to
take home with them, if they’d only see it out! The real
cause of the depressing turn things took was that the
conversazione guests were the outward and visible results
of “ Two ladies’ tickets with ever3' banquet ticket,” and
didn’t know one another from Eve; and as no well-
regulated woman sister in a low-cut dress ever dreams of
chumming in with a sister to whom she hasn’t dealt
pasteboard, the proceedings, tho’ dignified, were ex-
tremely flat.
Lord Charles Scott’s speech at the banquet was long
enough to fatigue his feet as well as his throat—but, yet,
there were many things he didn’t say. It’s all very well
to talk about the navy protecting the poor planter and
rushing to exterminate belligerent black men, but what
we want to know is the reason why Her Majesty’s ships
always have sealed orders or something for Melbourne at
Cup time? and for Hobart or Maoriland when the weather
gets hot ? Also, why naval officers never pay admittance
at charity balls, and never contribute their whack to the
expenses of any subscription party they are asked to join
in ? However, I suppose the Admiral inferred all that
when he spoke of the navy as “ police on the Australian
seas.” Your average policeman, I'm told, always knows
where to go for his cold meat—to put it in graceful
metaphor.
Ere Admiral Scott vanishes finally over the misty deep,
it should be said that he deserves to be the most popular
of all sailors with Australian womankind. “The wisest
thing I ever did was to marry an Australian lady,” said
he at his farewell banquet. The women should promote
a testimonial and send it after him.
Evidently all the hooked-nosed, pince-nez’d Duchesses,
and so on, who make perilous voyage in a padded P. & 0.
boat to this land of outer social darkness, have taken
back glowing accounts to their foggy little isle —or else
they regard us as an entertaining menagerie that is really
quite worth the trouble of going to see. There must be
something engaging about Australasia for the old
nobility,” because where we used to have one in every 10
years, we now get regular consignments.
It’s well that Australian Governois get better paid than
of yore, for they have to stand the strain of all those
itinerant grandees—a strain unknown to the satraps of
fifty years ago. Viewing the steady stream of lords j
duchesses, and even princes, who come at their own
sweet wills, but with the fullest intention of boarding
round at the various Government-houses, one feels sorry
that Tasmanian Parliament declined to add £SOO to
their Governor’s £3OOO. These musings are induced by
the fact that the double-barrelled Duchess of Buckingham
and Chandos has got to Melbourne, and intends “doing ”
us thoroughly. In one way, mind you, the old nobility
did a rash thing in ever letting us see any of them.
While they kept away we thought duchesses and mar-
chionesses were all beauty and Paris raiment, but when
they started dumping four portmanteaux and a parrot
down on our wharves, and generally revealing themselves
to be fat old parties with holland dust-cloaks and green
goggles, we lost faith in their picturesqueness. Since our
“attention has been drawn” to the nobility, we have
regarded the society novel as more than ever a work of
fiction.
“Silver King,” at Her Majesty’s, came to the end of
pay-dirt last week, but while his honoured shadow is still
distinct I want to remonstrate with Miss Watson for
wearing a dark underskirt beneath the artistic yellow tea-
gown which used to look so effective against Handsome
George’s lavender race-suit. The effect was as if she had
sat in a coal-bin and then put her frock on {inside out.
Women who affect filmy fabrics can’t be too nice about
the colour of their underwear, but I think that stuffs
unlined come under the heading of “ what not to wear.”
I lately drifted in the wake of a block belle who had on an
airy, transparent, white gown. Her corsets (I know only
women read these remarks) were grey and her under-
bodice reached only a little way below her arms so as not
to interfere with the waist-line. It (the under-bodice) was
tucked three deep round the gunwale and finished with a
row of red, buttonhole embroidery, and above that her
pink back shone with veiled radiance. No, I didn’t assist
at her toilet. I saw it all through her unlined muslin
blouse as she billowed down the street!
Sydney Womanhood Suffrage League has regained the
confidence so rudely shaken by its inauspicious encounter
with Sir George Dibbs, and has once more taken the
floor in the interests of poor, weak woman. It held a
public meeting the other evening, when many astonishing
remarks were made. For instance, one M.P. rose and
ambiguously stated that “ woman had never produced a
Shakespeare or a Mozart or a Handel! lam only a
blushing spinster, cowering behind a gauze fan, but still
I really have had a mamma, and it is merely blind,
idiotic prejudice to say that woman had no say in the
production of Shakespeare, Mozart, and Handel aforesaid.
But a still more surprising statement was that women
“ had refined the stage!” Every well-dressed, minoingly-
mouthed actress brings a certain amount of surface
refinement with her, of course, but you’-ve only (o scratch
the polish, after all. Outward niceness and cold-blooded
suggestion are quite a possible pair, and in stage plays-
especially the society play—it’s the lady in the long
frock and the diamonds whose postures and veiled utter-
ances make you blush up to your scalp if you’re not quite
broken to the cool methods of the star performer. And
does the ingenuous M.P. who made the astonishing dis-
covery really think that the gold-washed, rouge-stained,
eye-blackened ogler on the front row, who takes off as
much as she dares, and fills in the rest of the picture with
meaning side-glances into the stage-boxes—does he really
think that she has a “ refining influence ?”
After this, I shall never give anyone my photo. A
certain well-known teacher of music, in a Southern city,
would beg and implore his friends and pupils to be
photographed (cabinet size) for his sake, and they would
save up and elaborately posture for a pretty picture,
which they would pay for, and bring to him in triumph.
One day a male called and asked the professor to go for a
walk. That genius consented, but, on assuming his
boots, a sixpence-sized hole was discovered underneath.
Without a moment’s hesitation the professor took a
cabinet photo, from his huge stack, cut it down to the
shape of his sole, and fitted it in. “ That’s What I got
’em for,” said he, in answer to the other’s gasp of aston-
ishment—“l use ’em in wet weather, too. They’re as
good as cork soles in a pair of leaky boots 1 ”
Talking about photos. A Sydney youth who jilted a
confiding girl to whom he had vowed eternal love, could
hardly have felt remorse for his cruelty when he got his
numerous photos back from his revengeful ex-darling.
Every one of them had its eyes gouged out, and inked
black horns projecting from its head. Then he wrote
back and said that she must consider herself lucky to
miss marrying the devil.
That was quite a Oleopatra-ish episode at Government
House the other day, when Lady Jersey perfumed a
handkerchief with scent projected from the venom-fangs
of a “snake.” Naturalist Bray is responsible for the
complete success of the achievement— the first of its kind
in the world. Another illustration of what may happen
to a Countess in Australia.
In the new magazine, the Antipodean, we are to have
three portraits of Sydney society belles —presumably
queen roses of the local rosebud garden of girls. Now,
there are a lot more than three pretty girls in Sydney,
and the girls who are left out can console themselves by
reflecting that the belle who gets printed as such is more
often than not a well-gilded, well-groomed individual who
takes an artistic photograph in which the freckles don’t
show, nor the size of her feet, and somebody sends it to
the editor With her “ inkum ” written large across one
corner. Though, mind you, I don’t mean to infer in
advance that the Antipodean’s apples of discord— l mean
photographs—aren’t perfect Venuses chosen purely on
their profiles.
“An Observer” (feminine) enquired the other day in a
Sydney paper whether chivalry wasn’t dead and whether
men w<ren’t turning into positive brutes? She com-
plained of not having a chair handed to her when she was
applying somewhere for a billet, and of being left pro-
miscuously in a passage, and she ended her rather fretful
epistle with the query: “Is chivalry dead, or is it a
thing of the past for women to expect courtesy and pro-
tection from the stronger sex?”
My personal view is that since woman has been agitat-
ing for equal rights with men and discussing him on
platforms as a miserable object who couldn’t come in out
of the wet without her assistance, it seems highly
probable that chivalry has given up the ghost. Men
don’t set chairs for one another, and smirk at one another,
and if woman is going to pretend to equality with
them she must learn to hang by her elbows, and chew'
tobacco while she is waiting for jobs, and not expect
fauteuils and flattery. The w’orst part of it is that only
one raging female in a hundred goes for Women’s Bights,
but as she makes more row about it than the other ninety-
nine put together, the result is—well, the question, “Is
chivalry dead? ”
> The most artistic figures in the “ English Bose,” at Her
Majesty’s, were Harry Shine, in a ragged red waistcoat
(with other portions of apparel, of course) and his eyes
beautifully worked up, and Miss Watson, in russet rags
for the most part, except an Erin-go-bragh sort of gown
in the first act which didn’t become her so well. Pretty
Hilda Spong (whose charms are too diminutive to be felt
in a big theatre) sported rather a dolly pink frock in the
first act, but out a neat figure in the inevitable riding-
habit, without which no Irish drama is complete. It is
never cleared up, by the way, why Miss S. goes out on a
gee-gee but comes home on a jaunting-car. The inference i 8
that even a horse wants to get rid of the stage heroine.
In the last acts Miss Spong looked duly pathetic in
stylish mourning, and she didn’t wear white hose with it,
as* Mary Kingsley did when she played the part. The
actress who wears light stockings with inky robes always
makes you anticipate a lightning change to a bridal array
later. Mr. Lionel Bignold’s clever facial get-up as
Nicodemus pointed the moral that he will never be
confounded with handsome cousin George—not on the
stafe. at any rate—but Sass, in an unwonted clean shave,
as The village priest, was a thing of radiant linen and
beauty, and only once put up his hand to fondle the
vanished mustivey.
From Messrs. Edwards, Dunlop and Cos. I have received
a collection of exquisite Xmas souvenirs. A particularly
artistic thing is a russet-covered ’9B almanac with silver
chains to suspend it by, and inside dreamy quotations
from O. Wendell Holmes set in a framework of gem-like
pictures. A novelty in booklets is “Sally in our Alley,”
illustrated, and with words and music at the end; and
even the nil admirari Australian child should rouse in
the presence of the “ Book of Nursery Khyines.” All
these elegant superfluities are English—Australia has yet
to learn how to work up a dainty Xmas “ card.” A few
seedy flannel-flowers gummed unevenly on a bit of paste-
board glaringly out of plumb—or a dismal photo, of Cow
Flat with a “ Merry Xmas.” done darkly in one corner, is
as far as we have got at present.
I went to a Turkish bath the other day, and heard the
twelve-slone charmers solemnly discuss, one with the
other the dissolving of their generous proportions. Some
of them talked as if they left three pounds of fat behind
them after every encounter with the hot scrubbing-brush.
The little public of the bath see no appreciable difference
in her but Juno vows the tape meets easily where it
wouldn’t before, and the scrubbing-woman hypocritically
acquiesces with professional enthusiasm. It struck me
that it must be an awful thing to be Beauty-washer at a
Turkish bath, and to be confronted with a forty-two-moh-
waisted Little Buttercup, who “ complains to the manage-
ment ”if she isn’t pared down to forty in one tubbing I
Yours affectionately,

Duncan Gillies takes a melancholy interest
in those fine statues in Ballarat Gardens. The
late George Russell Thomson was “mates” with
Gillies on the goldfields in tlie long ago, and, when
dying, he sent for his former chum, then Premier,
to come and see him. But Gillies was very
busy just then and, not thinking Thomson’s
illness was so serious, omitted to keep the
appointment. Result, that, in Thomson’s will, the
=£sooo originally intended for Gillies and the
£5OO intended for the Gardens changed places,
and Duncan had the ghastly pleasure, in the name
of his dead friend, of presenting the statues,
purchased, as it were, at his own expense, to the
people of Ballarat. How Thomson’s ghost must
have grinned—for even a Scotch ghost has humour.
It transpires that Mr. Whippingdale John-
son, the “zealous” special magistrate sent from

receiving (besides his £B6O a year, regular salary)
£2 a day, or £l4 a week, extra, with all his
“actual travelling and hotel expenses paid.'”'
Which, in a roundabout way, recalls the fact that
the present writer was once an officer in an Aus-
tralian public department where his official salary
was only £lOO a year, with £4O forage allowance,
but, being the pet protege of a Minister, he was
placed to do work which allowed him to charge
“ex.’s.” These amounted in six months to over
£4OO, which were duly paid on voucher. Then,,
unfortunately, a political crisis was precipitated',
his Government was turned out, and he was sent
back to his minor billet at £8 6s, Bd. a month,
phis £lo' a quarter.
“OH DON’T TOUCH ME t DON’T COME
NEAR ME!"
These words were uttered with a howl—almost a>
yell. Yet the boy to whom they were addressed,
wasn’t within 10 feet of the howler, and wouldn’t-
have come closer for bis life. The scene was a big
business office in New York, and the howler was.
the chief man in it. He owned the concern, and*
was very rich, and a decent fellow enough. But
sometimes he would break out like that, and howl
as though he had just discovered a fire in a>
powder-mill. You could hear him from the base-
ment to the roof. What was the matter with
him? Temporary insanity ? Not quite, but some-
thing nearly as bad. He had an acute attack of
gout in his toe, and at those solemn crises he-
couldn’t bear the sight of even a shadow moving:
in his direction. Ask somebody who has the gout-
how it feels. Fancy a blacksmith twisting your
toe with hot pincers while a shoemaker is thrust-
ing: a-bradawl through your knee-joint. That’s a>
littlb like it.
Well,, there are things not so bad as gout, yet
they make us touchy enough. Here comes a man,
for instance, who says, “ Everything now was a
trouble to me.” What should he talk that way
for ?._ Why should everything have been a trouble-
to him ? There is an old saying that while we-
can’t keep the crows from flying, we needn’t let-
them-make nests in our hair. That’s good sense*
But it’s-easy to give advice and to quote proverbss.

Now., the foundation of all feeling and pain is-
the nerves. An hour or two of toothache is a.
lesson, on the nervous system. But there are-
diseases (or one disease anyhow) in which all the

andisound. The mind is on the look-out for evil
—the man is-depressed and afraid. Every word,
means mischief, and every bush hides an enemy.

Ex-Freetrade-Secretary Pulsford issues a
long and bitter wail in Sydney Echo to the effect
that the accursed M'Kinley tariff has reduced the
price of wheat in New York to the Joweht figu r.

all out of Harrison’s logic.’’ Pu'sford lives as a
rule, by demonstrating that 1 rotection is bail
because it raises the price of food, but now and
then, to rest his intellect, he goes in for showing
that it is bad because it lowers the price of food
instead.
The enormous mortality among the (Queens-
land Kanaka slaves is largely due to the change
from a vegetable and fruit diet to salt beef and
damper. Men, who are mere walking skeletons,
refuse this food with loathing and beseech the
overseers for cocoa-nut! cocoa-nut!! Attei
work many drag their weary bones to the beach
for shell-fish. Many grow too weak to walk
back, and the overseers have to turn out and
fetch them home in the plantation drags; the
sick niggers are then known to be within measur-
able distance of manuring the cane-brake.

Out of fourteen capitalistic associations
invited by the N.S.W. Council of Arbitration to

Union flatly refused to send representatives ; the

In Cornwall (Eng.) it is quite usual to
grant leases of property for the term of a royal

these illustrious creatures have pegged out, the
pub. will “fall in” to the ground landlord.
There’s a good deal of mild excitement about this

Sydney. Fancy buying a six-room villa for as

A few long-headed “heroes of civilisation,”
taking time by the forelock, bought up all the
then available grave-lots in the fashionable
Waverley (Sydney) cemetery, and are now adver-
tising the same for sale at boom prices. Brutal

grave !

So many real and quasi swells have married
in Australia that their English connections, no
matter how remote, are inundated with visitors
from the Kavvlinies who claim relationship on the
strength of these matrimonial adventures. It has
become such a bore, writes The Bulletin s London
correspondent, that a member of one well-known
family vows he will have inscribed on his lodge-
gates, “No member of this family has ever
married an Australian.”

One night lately, some
Sydney amateur fishermen
killed' a big tiger-shark,
weighted the “body” with
stones, and sank it in a pro-
minent civil servant’s private
bathing-house. Early next
day the C.S., a portly and
dignified personage, went for
hisdip, took a header, landed
ded against the shark -and
then, in the costume of Adam
before the fall, aflfrightediy
tore up the lawn, rushed
through the house, and had
three fitsin quick succession
in the backyard, to the
horror of his female servants
—two of whom went into
hysterics, while the third
climbed the back-fence and
made for the Home of Hope
for the Friend less and Fallen.
The head of a department is
now laid up, suffering from
severe shock, while two
general servants, discharged
without “characters,” talk
of gettinga Select Committee

awful conduct of one of the

Piety has received a great shock in Sydney
junior banking circles. Some of the big banks
have ukased that no clerk may leave the bank
premises during luncheon-hour without special
permission. The young officials have been attend-
ing mid-day open-air gospel-meetings, and almost
invariably returning late to the temples of Mam-
mon. The cold-eyed bank-directors of to-day
recognise that, in the long run, obtrusive godliness
rarely balances its cash.

H.E. Lord Glasgow visited Christchurch
(M.L.) on November 3 and was given the moat
“skimpy” reception on record. No band, no
bouquets—in fact, nothing that cost money. The
Mayor made a show of himself. At the luncheon
given by the city councillors, in proposing the
Governor’s health, he said, with his guest along-
side him, that “as all wanted to get away” he
would only make a short speech ! After lunch he
actually asked the Earl “ what he thought of the
feed !” Glasgow, in responding to his “health,”
chaffed the Mayor exquisitely for his tact, and
genius for organisation. Aristocratic Christchurch
feels much humbled by the whole affair.

Dr. W. Maloney, M.L. A. for West Mel-
bourne, spent his honeymoon in Adelaide, and his
pretty wife caused quite a sensation when she
appeared in the Speaker’s gallery of the local
Assembly. Much interest was taken in a loving
interlude, during which the democratic doctor was
digging a speck of dust out of the bridal eye with
the corner of a silk handkerchief, and there
seemed to be an inclination to adjourn the House
in order that members might assist in the opera-
tion.

A Sydney official, with a proverbially well-
waxed moustache, met with sad misfortune during
a recent trip to Samoa. One night cockroaches ate

Sydney with a sprouting crop which only now
approaches adolescence.
Fat-man Bevill, of N.S. Wales L.V. cor-

when writing his tale, “The Paying out of Con-

crest,” when we know that in the birth of male
and female twins the female is always a non-

The foundation - stone of an
Anglican Church was to be laid at
Goodwood, S. A., with much ceremony.
Of course, the local papers for that
date had to be buried according to
custom. But that morning’s S.A.
Register contained a portrait of R.C.
Bishop Reynolds, and the orthodox
Anglican felt that it would never do
to have a Papist’s “ counterfeit pre-
sentment ” beneath the foundations of
a church, whose parent, in its native
lair, is “ by Law Established.” Visions
of earthquakes and wall-topplings, to
say nothing of miraculous appearances
of Scarlet Ladies, Virgins, Magdalenes,
and Archangels made the English
parson shiver. So he snipped out of
the paper the Papistical portrait and
buried the mutilated Register along
with the other records ! Thus is his-
tory made.

“The Little Doctor ” (Maloney,
M.L.A.) is as a father to his West
Melbourne constituents. He had some
of them in the Strangers’ Gallery
during the last (before we went to
press) want-of-confidence debate in
the Victorian Assembly. Seats were
scarce, and the little Doctor was asked
if it would be safe to leave them during
the dinner - hour. “No! no! it
wouldn’t,” replied the good-natured
little man; “stay here and I’ll
bring you in some buns.” And he
did.
Why are the papers so careful to mention,
when any poor person is killed or found dead, that
the body wap “well-nourished”? It isn’t an
interesting item. They never mention, when an
emperor dies, that he seemed to be _ well-
nourished.” And they only throw in this item in
the case of a dead person, and never—or hardly
ever—allude to it while the corpse is still alive.
1 [qw would it read in the Parliamentary reports,
for instance ; “ Mr. Reid, who seemed to be well-
nourished, moved an amendment ” ? If the pre-
s mt writer is found lying dead anywhere, and any
I taper mentions that he appeared to be well-
nourished, his ghost will haunt that office and
make a noise there like saucepans falling down a
lift.

Dear Bulletin, — Last year, on the Thom-
son (W.Q.), the river had been “up” for a few
days, and when the waters subsided, the body of
a luckless traveller was found right on the road.
Two policemen went out to bury the body, which
was much decomposed. After a short discussion
the officers decided to dig the grave close along-
side the poor clay, which they did ; then, getting
two long saplings, they gently lowered it over the
side ; then the earth was shovelled in, and all was
over. . . . No weird jackasses, no wattles,
no sobbing requiems—only the deep and hearty
curses of the bullocky as the front wheels of his
waggon go down to the nave in the bushman s
last bed. —Yours, etc., L.H.

Dunedin (M.L.) is in a blue funk. Butler,
gaoled years ago for arson after being acquitted of
the mysterious murder of the Dewar family, will
be let loose again soon. He threatened to ‘ be
even ” with his jurors and others if he ever came
out, and he’s quite capable of keeping his word.
He conducted his own defence—and made a speech
from the dock which, for acuteness and eloquence,
has never been approached by any man pleading
his own cause in an Australasian court.

The Victorian National Gallery students
exhibition is just opened at Melbourne. As usual,
the feature is the horribly plain woman model
reproduced in multiform shapes. One critic
declares she was suffering from jaundice,
and her skin-discolorations are faithfully repro-
duced. The trustees ransack Melbourne to dis-
cover something formless —a woman without a
face, a clothes-horse, a frame. And it is indis-
pensable she should be the mother of about
seventeen children.

N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley, delivering
the Full Court’s judgment re John Parker,
ex parte the Law Institute, acted his burlesque
part very well indeed. John Parker, who had
posed as a legal reform agent, was accused of
having drawn up legal documents for a fee on
behalf of a widow. It was clear that Parker had
drawn up the documents, but it was not proved
that he had charged for so doing. This is how
the Chief Justice perorated (S. M. Herald
report) ;
Though the Law Institute were perfectly right in
bringing this matin before the Court, still there was not
sufficient evidence to bring the respondent within the
section, or to justify the Court in acting upon it. There-
fore the Court did not award any punishment against
respondent, and the rule would be discharged upon
respondent paying all the costs.
In other words, the Court found Parker not guilty
and undeserving of punishment, but winked the
other eye and saddled him with costs! What a
shameless trades-union is the Law ?

Already come the small tales of the
Queensland slave-trade. It is told of the black-
birder Ariel, how two “boys” were landed as
“ returns ” thirty miles from their own home, and
had to pay toll heavily out of their possessions in
order to safely pass through the intervening tribes.
MISS BELLA BASHALL.
The Ariel “agent” is safe enough, because the
captain told the “boys” that the, wind was not
favourable for Sah Sun Bay (their destination),
and offered them the alternative of remaining on
board. So that the “boys” went of their own
choice, and everything is goodly. A few months
back a “ return ” was landed at Weasisi, Tanna,
of his own choice, he belonging to a neighbouring
village. Within an hour (tells the chronicler) he
was murdered for a cannibal feast, although thei’e
was a missionary living at the place. A Pentecost
native shot dead Edward Pasnin, a British ship-
owner, flying the French flag and recruiting
between the islands, Captain Jumeree, the master
of the Constantine (Pasnin’s cutter), and two
Polynesians —for the same neglect in respect of
being landed at “home.” Another “boy” very
nearly cooked the goose of Queensland Govern-
ment Agent Hammond, of the blackbirder
Lochiel. He chased Hammond ah over the ship,
knifing him as they ran. The official excuse is
that the “boy” was cranky. The whole slave-
trade is cranky, and is working up slowly but
perceptibly to what ex-Wilberforce Griffith, the
present Minister for kidnapping, once declared
“surpassed the blackest annals of the African
slave-trade.”

Ravenswood (N.Q,) hospital has the hor-
rible pre eminence of showing the highest ratio of
mortality among Australian hospitals. Its death-
record is 100 per cent.! The average number of
patient is 1. And he died the other day. The
startled committee held a special meeting to con-
sider the position. One man insisted on knowing
what all the sick in the hospital died of. The
Chairman: “The report does not exactly state
that lie died of malarial fever; but it states that
he was treated for malarial fever.” Neat.

Who will not agree to seek them through his country-

Who has made a god to worship in the image Qt his

Speaker Bent and his co-trustee, £ £
Smith, have given parliamentary testimony to the
perfect decorum of the ladies’ tug-of-war at Mel-
bourne Exhibition Building. Having heard
rumours to the prejudice of the tug from other
ladies—who didn’t, as it happened, dispel their
suspicions by a personal enquiry into the enter-
tainment, Bent and Smith went down to see for
themselves. Furthermore, they invited a party
of senators to assist them in searching for im-
propriety, and the result was eminently satis-
factory. The ladies overtaxed their strength while
tugging on the first night, but otherwise the
diversion was chaste and beautiful. £ £ Smith,
it seems, kept his ears open to detect any sound of
bad language, and was delighted by the altogether
elegant conversation of the fair performers. They
restricted themselves to such observations as, “I
am very fatigued,” or, “ How strange one feels
with all those dreadful men staring so.” Alto-
gether, it was a most respectable evening’s amuse-
ment, and both Bent and Smith solemnly assured
the House that nothing of the sort should occur
again :
Some of the results of the Sydney baby-
sensation. The time was night, and the place
Redfern railway-station. Two women had just
arrived by train, and hailed “ a ’ansom.” One of
them carried a parcel, badly disguised in brown
paper. The other one took her seat and said, in a
low, mysterious whisper, “’And it Inn.” Her
companion handed it in, and by the- lamplight the
cabman noticed two small, white legs sticking out
of the paper. He got off Ids perch in short order.
“■Come outer me keb,” he said, excitedly, “ Come
outer me bloomin'keb.” They came out andstoodon
the pavement with the brown paper parcel, and the
legs sticking out of it as a silent evidence that a
tragedy had been perpetrated. “Perleece !” said
the cabby in a stentorian voice, and a constable
and a big crowd promptly loomed up through the
mist. Then the Jehu explained in a hoarse tone
of voice that there was a dead hmfunt in that ’ere
parcel, and the officer seized the package with the
strong arm of the law and found that it contained
a sucking-pig, the pale and chubby hams of which
had been mistaken for the deceased cherub s legs.
The story closes with a cabman vanishing at a
tremendous bat into the darkness, and two women
and a pig blushing on the pavement.

During the coroner’s inquiry into the
Sydney baby-farming cases Mrs. Makin became
frenzied over the evidence given by one of her
daughters, and solemnly invoked the wrath of
Heaven boiling hot upon her head. A week later
the girl broke out unaccountably in blisters, and
had to be treated at the hospital, ihatisthe
sort of ourBe for us . one that takes the skin right
off your enemy’s nose. Cursing is practically a
lost art. Deeming had some slight idea of rudi-
mentary anathema—he was acquainted with the
raw material of cursing—but his curse is working
ou( . ver y s l OV vly. The modern curse, as a rule, is
no ~ 00( j except f n the case of a man who is just
to be hanged . When he curses the Judge
b) court, somehow the Judge generally dies at an
early date thereafter. Curses are ho good unless
they are made to measure; the slop-built sort
is practically useless. The best kind are ma le by
piounding toads with dead men’s bones at full
moon, or else by mashing serpents underneath
a gallows. Then the meat should be boiled, and
the soup thrown over the left shoulder at mid-
night on to the grave of a thankless child,

At the Sydney baby-farming inquest last
Friday the Coroner called on the father and
mother of one of the dead infants, and solemnly
asked the jury to consider, after examining and
pulling their skull-thatch, whether two persons
with hair like theirs would be likely to have a
child whose hair would correspond with the sam-
pie then before the Court. This is a novel method
of constructing evidence. Some day another
coroner will carry the system a little further, and
will ask a jmy to seriously consider whether a
P erson w ,th feet like the defendant could be
reasonably supposed to have married into a family

MOTTO : “See the Pale Martyr.”
N.B.: The motto is supposed to refer not to Parkes but to
some creditor of his.
whose teeth resembled those of the deceased, of
whether the back-hair of the remains were incom-

played solely for the benefit of the Evening Baby-
market and its loathsome contemporaries.

The Newcastle (N.S.W.) hospital dispute,
involving as it does the rights of patients and the
status of the governing body of the institution, is
of more than local interest. So far as the outside
world can seeitis the democratic principle asserting
itself, through the action of the medical superin-
tendent, against the old-world medical etiquette.
The matter calls for an official enquiry and the
examination of witnesses on oath.
A tale of Queensland
hospitality. It was a
blazing day in Brisbane,
and an exhausted little
woman who tried to live,
or exist, by canvassing
for time-payment sewing
machines, had been plod-
ding through the streets
all day with no success.
She canvassed one sun-
struck terrace after an-
other, and put her baking
head in at doors where
the paint was blistering
off with the heat, but
no one in all Brisbane
seemed to want
machine. At last, in a
half-fainting condition,
she called on a kindly-
looking matron and tried
to trade with her, as
usual with no success.
But her obvious weari-
ness seemed to strike the
good old soul, and just
as the visitor was going
out of the gate she was
called back. “I s’pose
there isn’t very much
in your business these
times?” said the old
lady kindly. The de-
jected canvasser admitted
that there wasn’t indeed.
“ P'raps you’d like to
step in and have a cup
of tea?” continued the
good Samaritan with
motherly sympathy in
her eyes, and the parched
canvasser said that she
would, and prepared to
step in. “ Well,” said
the good old lady medita-
tively, “my fire’s out
just now, or else I’d make
you a cup. Good after-
noon.” And with that
the door closed, and a
haggard little woman,
whom the mention of tea
had made six times
thirstier than she was
before, went out into
the street again and
wondered.
At a Northern N.S.W. District Court the
defendant, an inveterate “kite-flyer,” was under

Judge) suavely : ‘‘You have given bills for every-
thing. You are, it seems to me, following in the
footsteps of Mr. Micawber.” Defendant (emphati-
cally and with much indignation): “ That s not
true, sir. I don’t know this Micawber, never saw
him in my life.” Even the court-bailiff laughed,

Gov. Hopetoun, “ during his recent trip
through Gippsland, wore the costume t f a bush-

It is no simple matter to state in terms at a’l
precise what forces are directly connected with the
production of hale and happy old age. More
certainly is involved in the process than mere
strength of constitution. Healthy surroundings,
contentment, and active, temperate and regular
habits are most valuable aids. Hard work, so
long, at least, as it is not carried beyond the limit
necessary to permit of the timely repair of worn
tissues, is not only harmless, but a conducive
circumstance. It is, in fact, by living as far as
possible a life in accordance with natural law that
we may expect to reap the appropriate result in
its prolongation. Great care should be taken to
protect the system against the changes which
disease makes therein. Coming misery casts its
shadows before it, and intimates its approach
by various signs, as a feeling of general weakness,
neuralgic pains, nervous headaches and rising of
sour wind from the stomach, backache and lum-
bago, failure of virility, and gradual diminution of
mental power, and similar symptoms. These all
tend to show that general debility is increasing in
the patient’s system. Such persons should take
notice of the experience of Captain P. Connelly,
20 Elliott-street, Balmain, Sydney, New South
Wales, who writes Three months ago my wife,
55 years of age, was confined to her bed, unable to
move. I called in Dr.- , of Balmain, who
pronounced the case as hopeless, and beyond all
human skill, it being a general breaking-up of the
system. He further told me she was in a high
state of fever (what kind he did not state). Her
temperature was 105. She was quite unconscious,
and apparently not far from her end. She re-
mained under his treatment for about ten days,
during which time she took the medicine be
prescribed without the least improvement. On
his third visit he again pronounced the ease as
hopeless, and told me to give no medicine, but
plenty of nourishment, and if I liked I could call
in another medical man. I could see my wife
rapidly sinking, and having heard of Clements
Tonic, I determined to try it. I purchased a
bottle from Mr.—, chemist, of Balmain.
When the doctor paid his fourth visit I had given
her three doses, and noticed a decided improve-
ment. When the doctor saw my wife he told me
that, wonderful to say, she was better, and he
repeated his former statement, and told me not to
be astonished if she died at any moment. I told
him what I had been giving her, and he said it
was no use giving it. I persevered with Clements
Tonic, and the fourth large bottle completely
restored her to health. She is now able to go
about as well as ever, and do her own house-
work; in fact, she has since attended to her
daughter and niece through their confinements,
and nursed a friend through typhoid fever. I
feel so thankful to you for your Clements Tonic
that I should be acting ungratefully if I did not
acknowledge the wonderful cure your Clements
Tonic has made. I may say that in every case I
advise people to try it, it has had the same effect.
I am well known in Balmain, holding as I do
several medals from the Royal Humane Society
for saving life. Anyone wishing to see me per-
sonally and ask me about Clements Tonic can
always find me at the above address.—l remain,
yours faithfully, Capt. P. Connelly, 20 Elliott-

A TALK OF THE TOG OF WAR.
Jemima was a “creature” (as the term is understood
By petticoated angels who are scrupulously good),
But now she is a lady, 0 ! a perfect lady, tor
She figured on the platform in that ladies’ tug-of-w'ar,
Jemima (so ’tis whispered) used to get upon the loose ;
Her mother often told her she was going to the doose.
She wasn’t altogether quite a darling to adore
Till someone came and booked her for the ladies’ tug-of-
war.
A change came o’er Jemima; she grew singularly staid -
She practised all the virtues of a fashionable maid ;
She left off eating onions steeped in vinegar galore,
The night she started training for the ladies’ tug-of-war.
It came upon the neighbours with a paralysing shook
To hear as how Jemima had been doin’ of the Block ;
And the urchins of the alley cried emphatically—“ Gor !
Bull yer ’ats orf to a leddy in the leddies’ tug-of-war !”
An air of calm refinement took possession of her face,
She didn’t run on errands with her bustle out of place.
She solemnly retracted all the wicked words she’d swore
Before she was promoted to that ladies’ tug-of-war.
Have you ever seen a lily all its petals fair unfold,
Disclosing in the centre graceful thingummies of gold,
Which you never had suspected to he hidden there before?
Thus Jemima was affected by the ladies’ tug-of-war.
The beauties of her nature came a-bursting into view ;
She went and found salvation in the corner of a pew,
And knelt to ask forgiveness, till her marrowbones were
sore,
In order to be fitted for the ladies’ tug-of-war.
The night of the performance found Jemima on the job,
Her back-hair neatly fastened in a natty little knob ;
The perspiration trickled out of every blessed pore,
And she fainted like a lady in the ladies’ tug-of-war.
Should you run against Jemima (who is not at all a
myth—
Her certificate of morals bears the signature of Smith)
Do not make the least allusion to her giddy days of yore ;
Bhe is settled down and married since the ladies’ tug-of-
war.
The member for Bangwhangy (he was sitting close to
Bent), , .
Being smitten by her muscles, begged her relatives con-
sent , ,
To offer his addresses ; and that ardent bachelor
Found a missus in Jemima at the ladies’ tug-of-war.
The wedding-l>ells rang gladly on a recent summer’s day,
And good old Duncan Gillies gave the happy man away ;
A wreath of orange-blossoms on her brow Jemima wore,
And the bridesmaids were selected from the ladies’ tug-
of-war.
Even the stupid stats
Stuck up in the sky—
Seeing the human farce,
Wink the other eye.
His boots were patent-leather, and the leggings
drawn above
Were of stuff that only lordships can afford,
His shirt was gay, his riding trousers fitted like a
glove,
And were fashioned from the latest thing in
cord.
The noble bush man rode a gentle, flock-bed kind
of moke,
And he didn’t foot a hundred yards together.
“ Where’s yer bloomin’ blanky bluey ?" scoffed a
ribald rural bloke.
Answered Hopey : “Do you weali them this
hot weathah ?”

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
WENTWORTH FALLS.
'THIS MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACRES has been
surveyed bv Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydney, into 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
Residential Blocks to 10J Acres, situate only 500 yards
from the WENTWORTH PALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of R. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger on the Great Western railway.
When the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may be safely described as
The Madeira of the Blue Mountains,
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing purity of the fmountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
is well described by the poet, viz.: —
The waratah, all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
Shines through the clustering ferns ;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
Falls in soft showers, its deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know?
’Tis the charming Estate of Fontainebleau !
The Blaxland Road is now being made from the Railway
fence, and, as it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be without exception the finest
Carriage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the most elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls —far and away
superior to the land on the other side of the line. The
picturesque views and the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Dairy Farms,
for which Nature seems to have intended it.
&W" Early Buyers will do well to secure their Lots at
once, as they are likely to largely advance in value. The
terms are liberal, to suit all buyers. For lithos., and all
particulars, apply to the Proprietor—

E. Jones, formerly a Barrier cricketer, now
playing with South Adelaide, has caused a sensation by
his fast bowling—perhaps the quickest in Australia. He

Singapore, that most remarkable instance of a
good horse gone wrong, died the other day. Singapore
took the A. J.O. Derby of ’B9 for Mr. James White, and a
few days later the three-year-old won a nine-furlong
handicap with a brilliant rush, giving 471bs. to the second
horse. Then Singapore became first favourite for Mel-
bourne Cup, and lost the means of raising a gallop ever
again. Either he had strained a back sinew, or got the
rheumatism, or something. Anyway, Singapore never
won another race, or got near to winning one. Matt.
O’Shanassy bought him, and this light of other days was
allowed to run and get beaten, until people had almost

with the news that Singapore was suffering from a

Hickey’s showing with Jim Richardson at

nicety with the right and brought him down plump.
Hickey repeated the performance several times, and it
was only Richardson’s indomitable pluck that enabled
him to face the music for round three. Hickey threw
away his golden opportunity' by not following up his
beaten opponent, and as Richardson gained strength he
commenced to knock Hickey about, and by round five it
was any man’s battle. Rounds seven and eight saw
Hickey a beaten man, and only police intervention robbed
Richardson of a hard-earned victory.

Dear Bulletin, —I am prepared to prove that
two-thirds of the playing members of a certain leading
Melbourne football-club are professional bummers, men
who are never known to earn an honest penny all the
year round, who loaf on the charity of the club, a real
dead-beat “push,” a trained troupe of beer-drainers
whose sole purpose in life appears to be hanging around a
certain hotel in Spencer-street, swallowing half-pints.
The very flesh on their bones does not belong to them,

The Victorian Treasurer refuses to allow 50 tons

W. J. Wilson, the well-known scenic
artist and formerly lessee of Sydney Garrick, is
getting up an art-union to dispose of a large
number of original paintings. The collection is
on view in the Imperial Arcade, near the Garrick,

conducted under the auspices of a number of well-
known gentlemen, and should prove a genuine
success.
The prospectus of the Broken Hill Work-
men’s Provident Co-operative Association,
Limited, has been printed and circulated. Its
object is to carry on the co-operative store
that formed such a noticeable background in the
recent strike. A central store will be established
and departments added to it as means will allow.
It will manufacture or import articles of food and
clothing, domestic utensils, and tools of handi-
crafts and agriculture. A tract of land is to be
taken up as a combined farm and sanatorium for
sick or disabled shareholders and employes. The
working hours of employes are to be limited to
48 per week, with three weeks’ holiday every
year. One per cent, of the profits is to be reserved
for founding a library and recreation-room for the
benefit of shareholders and employes. The
remaining profits will either go to a reserve-fund
or be distributed in bonuses. Every shareholder
must be a unionist, or a member of a unionist’s
family, and each can only hold one share.
The venerable Parkes, or somebody, as a
practical joke, has persuaded the Sydney Daily
Telegraph to publish the full text of a slushful
letter alleged to have been received by Parkes
from George Jacob Holyoake, the alleged owner
of the Reasoner— whatever that is in the world’s
waste-paper basket—and who, with a “John
Hornblower, of Melbourne”—mighty anonymity !
—and a “ Dr. Hollick, of New York ” —also illus-
triously unknown —are said to have been boys
together “in Birmingham more than 60 years
ago.” Here are patches of this doubtful epistle :
Your great friend, Lord Tennyson, has died in the
moonlight glory. . . Now I know it was your poem
whose power and passion reverberate still in my mind, as
it did when Hornblower first read it to me fifty years ago.
. . Of all the public men of my time I know no speaker
who could write your poems, nor any poet who could
make your speeches.
This is very ambiguous, either the lowest drift
mud of greasy flattery, or the most incisive irony.
You name Charles Pemberton [again the world is ignor-
antly adrift!] whom no lecturer has excelled. You, I,
Hornblower and Dr Hollick, of New York, still live, who
were entranced by his fervour. Of all the Birmingham
(Brummagem is probably meant) men of my time, you
have attained the highest distinction.
Again—
Ever and ever and hereafter if it can be arranged—
Yours, George Jacob Holyoake.
Soardom of peacockery ! If this be a genuine
letter, and Parkes can contentedly sneak it into
publicity and watch for effects, it is the very senility
of craokbrained vanity, and the Old Man ought
to be tenderly warded in a Benevolent Asylum for
Dodderers. But the document smells fishy. Twig
the names —Holyoake, Hornblower, Hollick ! or,
as Parkes would say, ’Olyoake, ’Ornblower,
’Ollhick.

•gEAUTIFUL SPRING
At this season of the year Nature puts on a new garb,
and there is a general all-round exhilaration. Upon the
human system this sudden change has very marked
effects, and great care is necessary in keeping all the
machinery of the body in good working order. No piece
of mechanism will of its own accord, always run freely,
but must have constant attention, and as a lubricant is to
an engine so is “ Karana ” to an individual. At no time
of the year are there so many petty ailments as during
spring tid", and the system requires good overhauling.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert has found that Karana is the
required tonic, and it is recommended as a faithful friend
to all persons. A cheerful disposition is assured to all
those who partake of this splendid remedy.

known or respected woman in Hawkes Bay than Sister
Mary Joseph, nor one whose efforts for the relief of the
suffering sick have been more successful. During her
long stay in this colony (over 30 years) Sister Mary Joseph
has devoted herself to the discovery and uiilisation of the
medicinal virtues with which our New Zealand flora is so
lavishly endowed. The result of her research s lias been
so successful that hundreds of families in Hawkes Bay
have had reason to bless Sister Mary Joseph’s long stay in
this province. Her remedies ultimately achieved a more
than local fame, not only in this colony, hut also in Aus-
tralia, and at last the demand for them so increased that
it became necessary for a business firm to take the matter

The Deniliquenfc (N.8.W.) jury is a trifle
penitent.
Caroline Bay, Tiraaru (M.L.) is called by
the Maoris Te Upokoaterakaitanweke. That’s
all.
A man who was shot at in Melbourne, the
other day, “seemed considerably annoyed
according to the local Herald.
Thousands of “native bears” are being
destroyed in the neighbourhood of Warwick (Q.),
and there is danger all over Australia, oh account
of the present high value of “bear” skins, that
this marsupial may speedily become extinct.
The Australian, it is alleged, cannot under-
stand the simplest proposition, unless his accus-
tomed blastiferous adjective is inserted to eluci-
date it. He can’t understand a fact, but a gory
fact is quite within his mental grasp. In support
of this assertion someone quotes a dialogue* said
to have been overheard at a recent political meet-
ing : “ I say, Bill, what is this ’ere One-man-one-
vote ?” “ Oh, it’s jest one blanky man one blanky
blank vote, don’t you see?” And then Bill realised
the situation. He couldn’t understand it before,
but when the “ blanky ” was put in a light
dawned on him. If this story isn’t true it ought
to be.
Concentrated Sunshine.
Concentrated sunshine is acknowledged vo be
Nature’s great remedy for all the ills that human
flesh is heir to* In no part of the world is the
remedy, in rays pure and serene, more freely
lavished than in New Zealand. The sunshine
playing on a clear, salubrious atmosphere has left
its impression on the fauna and flora of the colony.
The extinct moa, and wondrous coal deposits, pro-
claim the natural wealth of old New Zealand.
The muscular Maori and the splendid forests
survive. From these forests Mother Mary Aubert
has compounded several important remedies, and
we recommend the announcements elsewhere to
the perusal not simply of the sick, but of those in
health. “A stitch in time saves nine” applies to
the healing art more than to less important matters.
Mother Mary Aubert's New Zealand Remedies
are preventive as well as curative. When the first
symptoms of sickness appear, their power, in
cutting short the attack by rousing dormant
organs and functions to activity, is said to be
remarkable. Insidious ailments resemble the
burglar, but these remedies promptly applied give
the alarm and make him decamp. There is no
quackery about them, they are not foreign com-
pounds of which people know nothing, and which
may be pernicious, but they are the pure products
of New Zealand sunshine distilled through the
vegetable kingdom. Better than all, their
character has been proved, for they have been well
tested, and the best proof of their merits is that
their sale is rapidly increasing.
Auckland Star, May 7, 1892.
MOTHER AUBERT’S REMEDIES.
In these days of patent medicines it requires
that certificates of excellence should be signed by
the names of persons of standing in the com-
munity. The herbal remedies put up by the
Rev. Mother Mary Joseph Aubert, of Jerusalem,
Wanganui River, have already been highly spoken
of, and elsewhere will be seen an advertisement
which publishes in full the testimony of such
eminent personages as Lord Onslow, Bishop
Grimes, of Christchurch, Bishop Redwood, of
Wellington, and, passing from pulpit to stage,
Mr. Walter Bentley. The latter acknowledges
the wonderful result to his voice from using
MARUPA.
Another nreparation designated
KARANA
Is said to be equal to combating most of the ills of
life, and restores a broken-down constitution. It
is a vegetable tonic, pleasant to take, and by no
means hurtful in its action.
Obtainable everywhere.
It has been said “ many a time and oft ” that
no prophet hath honour in his own country, but
experience has not proved that this statement is
invariably correct. For instance, was Beacons-
field without honour ? Is Gladstone without
honour ? Is H. M. Stanley without honour ? Is
Bismarck, the “man of blood and iron,” without
honour?—he has now, alas ! somewhat fallen from
his former high estate, but still he has honour !
Coming nearer home, are Mr. Ballance, Sir Robert
Stout, Sir John Hall, or Mr. Rolleston, without
honour? No, none of these are without honour,
and rightly so, too, for all have some qualities
deserving of the highest commendation. But the
person entitled to the highest honour, esteem, and
respect is he who endeavours to alleviate in some
measure the sufferings of mankind. Such an one
is Mother Mary Joseph Aubert, the discoverer of
the now famous Aubert Remedies, “Paramo,”
“Karana,” “Natanata,” and “Marupa.” There
are many who scoff at what are called “ patent
medicines,” but let it be remembered that there
are patent medicines and patent medicines. The
Aubert Remedies are the theme of universal praise
—and why ? Because they are not mere quack
decoctions, but are pure herbal medicines prepared
solely from New Zealand plants, the medicinal
values of which, for various complaints, have been
accurately ascertained after years of patient and
laborious research. Not only in New Zealand but
in Australia has the fame of these preparations
become universally known, and it is confidently
asserted that no medicines have achieved such
instantaneous success as the Aubert Remedies.
A N.Q. bullocky had been “pitching’’
about a certain dry stage over which he had

ITHOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 515 George Street,
, Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, do hereby
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows : —
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “ UNIVERSAL ALFALINE
PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since. , r
THE ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
betrue ‘ • THOS. MUDIMAN.

always feel grateful to you, and will always recommend your
remedies to my friends, and I am willing at any time to
be interviewed by any person who doubts this Testimonial.

me of a terrible complaint after the doctors gave me up,
and, although it is four years since, I am as well as ever. 1
shall recommend your remedies to all. —Yours gratefully, R.
Albury, 01 Washington-st., Sydney.
Herr Rassmussen—I am pleased to inform you that your
Alfaline Remedies acted most wonderful in my case. I consider
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely sub-
stantiated, both in my case and in several of my family and acquaint-
ances to whom I have recommended their use. I consider they
are far more efficacious than any remedy yet brought before
the public, and the Victorians will be pleased when they hear
that you have established a Depot at 150 Bourke-street, Mel-
bourne.— Edward Drew, Storekeeper, 51 Barkly-st, Ballarat.

doctors failed to do him any good.— John F. Anderson, Port

mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.’’—Sydney Evening

Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe.
He has devoted a life- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi)
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There’s a fellow on the station
(He dropped in on a call,
Just casual—to stay a pleasant week),
He’s a banker’s near relation,
Strongly built, and very tall,
Not altogether destitute of cheek ;
He’s a decent judge of whisky,
And the hardest-working youth
Who ever played at polo on a cob;
His anecdotes are risky,
And, to tell the honest truth,
He’s waiting here until he gets a job.
He’s waiting, as I mention,
And whene’er he says his prayers,
Which he doesn’t do as frequently as some,
And I fear that his intention
Isn’t quite so good as theirs—
For he prays to God the work may never come.
He marches with the banner
Of the noble unemployed,
He mixes with the fashionable mob,
But while he’s got a tanner
He scorns to be decoyed
Where there’s any chance that lie may get a job.
He’s an excellent musician.
And the song that suits him best,
“ Old Stumpy,” is a masterpiece of art;
’Tis a splendid composition
As he chucks it off his chest,
Though there’s something of a hitch about the
start.
He’s an artist, too, in colours,
For he painted up the boat.
You wonder—but he did, so help me bob,
And all the champion scullers,
When once he gets afloat,
Couldn’t catch him—if they offered him a job.
He’s very unpretending,
Most affable and kind,
He’ll take a whisky any time it suits ;
Extremely condescending,
He really does not mind,
He’ll even, when it’s muddy, wear your boots.
Some think he isn’t clever,
But it’s my distinct belief
That there’s much more than they fancy in his nob.
But he’s travelling on the “ never ”
And will surely die of grief
On the day when he’s compelled to take a job.
BAROROFT H. BOAKE.
Aucassin’s Choice.
In the old French story of “Aucassin and Nicolette,”
date 1130 a.d., recently done into English prose by Bour-
dillon, are told the loves of Aucassin, a great lord’s son,
and a beautiful slave girl, Nicolette, which by the opposi-
tion of Aucassin’s relatives are made much less pleasant
for them than they' might be. One day a friend of the
family reminds Aucassin that, by the ecclesiastical law,
he who marries a slave cannot go to Paradise. To him in
the forceful language of the period Aucassin replies some-
thing in this wise
To paradise ! There go these puling priests,
And halt old men, all mortified and maimed,
Who go about more filthy than the beasts
For sake of holiness, nor are ashamed,
Who hope thereby a mansion in the skies
To earn, and lay up store of heavenly wealth,
Who, with God’s goodness all before their eyes,
Despise His water, ruining their health.
Thither go they who day and night do cower
By altars, and by dead bones in a crypt,
Who fondly think to God they give each hour
From which all joyaunce have they vilely ript,
Who know not eovetise, and yet do covet
The right to say what folk in Heaven shall live;
Who preach of lowlihood, but little love it,
Who preach of charity, but little give.
Yea : these be they that enter Paradise,
These hermits hungry, monks with clouted
frocks,
And naked folk and shoeless, food for lice
Which traverse visibly their matted locks ;
And they who garments change not, but the same
Will wear till they unto them like a skin
Do stick. What wonder they be sore and lame !
Where these do go would I not enter in !
But rather unto hell I fain would go,
For thither fares the glad and goodly clerk,
Brave knights who fell ’mid many a swashing
blow,
When swordstroke rang on helmet and hauberk.
There go men noble, who our earthly joys
Contemn not, nor in sadness spend their lives,
To whom the world’s no prison that annoys,
To whom its pleasures are not galling gyves.
And thither pass the ladies fair and free
And courteous, with red lips and golden hair,
Who have two loves—aye, or even three! —
And other noble company and rare.
These be the folk that I would rather see ;
With these, O croaker, would I liefly go !
If Nicolette I wed, then must this be,
Sayst thou ? I’m doubly blest, friend. Be it so !
STEELE GREY.
A man under ari’est, in Japan, for theft,
cut off the arresting constable’s head, and
endeavoured to escape. The constable is not
expected to recover.
The late Rev. Dr. Nish was once bailed
up by aS.A. Customs official, who enquired if he
had any articles of Victorian manufacture in his
possession. The doctor replied in the affirmative,
and being asked what they were he said, “Only
a few old sermons. ”
Horrible—but possibly unintentional-
libel from the Cooktown (Q.) Courier: “His
Excellency Sir W. M'Gregor’s watch and other
trifles were recovered from the natives at Chan-
cellor Bav (New Guinea), which was stolen from
him when there some months ago by the officers
and crew of the Lizard, assisted by Magistrate
Henry, stationed at Samarai.” The omnipotent
comma, again!

‘‘ My son has heed badly afflicted
with a fearful and threatening cough
for several months, and after trying
several prescriptions from physicians
which failed to relieve him; he has
been perfectly restored by the use of
two bottles of Bo-
schee’s German Syr-
up; I can recom-
mend it withbut
hesitation.” Chronic
severe, deep-seated coughs like this
are as severe tests as a remedy can
be subjected to. It is for these long-
standing cases that Boschee’s Get l

Many others afflicted as this lad
was, will do well to make a note of
this.

Premier Shiels, short-sighted as usual, didn’t

only make matters worse. In Hingland they naturally

When the cheque was presented it was dishonoured. He

We trust that the democratic section of the

When the big breakaway occurred at the Spa-
Jessep dam (Shoalhaven, N.S.W) the water was backed up
many miles in the creek, and was 30ft. deep at the bank
at the time Of collapse—when away went a year’s supply
through the channel, some 70ft. wide. The break
Occurred a few hours after some of the big Melbourne
shareholders had champaghed over the hews “dam
ilearlv full.” Undismayed by the wire, “ dam burst, the
directors engaged the ex-Surveyor-6eneral of Victoria to
remedy the breach. He advised bags filled with Clay.
Of these 20,000 were forwarded, and already they have
been placed in position—ls at the bottom, and tapering
away to a single bag at the top.
The cost of repairing will be something like
£2OOO. When full, the Spa-Jessep dam will be one of the
biggest, if not the largest, mining dam in the world. It
will be 17 miles long, and, in one place, three miles wide.
Allowing for evaporation and the use of 9,000,000 gallons

machinery capable of lifting 4,500,000 gallons a day is

Two miners, Beagly and Gibson, have crushed
22 tons for 1430z5., at Drake, N.S.W., and in the ridiculous
excitement of the moment the newspaper corres-
pondent says: “The field is now one of the best
n N.5.W.,” which is saying, very little —much
ess, probably, than he intended. He also declares
that the reef is 3ft. thick—in which case, if it is not a
patch, there should be nothing to prevent their crushing
ten times the amount of stone. The mountain from
which the crushing was taken is called Carington, and
the number of openings in it reminds the visitor of the
yawning ex-Governor. There are a number of claims all
over the hill, which has been distinguished by a number
of rich surface crushings and disgraced by a far greater
number of poor ones. The reefs, mostly ill-defined, run
in various directions. About the best show a PP% r '
ently is Marker's, where there is a well-defined bfltiy
of stone, 150 tons of which is now going through. Baraer
has shown great pluck in the manner in which he has
opened up his mine before crushing.

bute its comparative prosperity to the Barrier fields.

in this claim during the last three years, principally in

all-round tribute fail, it is easy to predict that the mine
will be abandoned and the plant sacrificed. There was
never anything in the surface-workings of the claim to

In the early days, some of the most lively spots
in Victoria were Guildford, Kangaroo, Vaughan, etc.
For many years past these places, where lots of gold
was won, have been silent as cemeteries : chiefly through
want Of water to treat big areas o'f dirt. Things have
altered now-; water can he brought for hundreds instead
of thousands, and a dozen ‘men are cutting a four-mile
race to bring water on to “ Pennyweight Hill,” where a
body of wash exists from 40 to 70 ft. in depth—to shift it,
the work of years. The party claim that their property
carries a little gold from top to bottom, and that 4d. per
load would, with hydraulic assistance, pay wages ; but
the stuff looks good enough for a shilling per load.
Twenty years ago, this hill was reckoned to be the best
for a sluicing claim in the district, yet until now water
has not been brought in, and now the ‘then lessees
have, after tramping all over Australia, returned With
reliable mates to shift the hill. About Xmas time should

Dear Bulletin,—ln a recent issue, describing
the Catherine Reef, at Eaglehawk (Vic.), you mention
that as high as 33 per cent, has been paid by tributors for a
piece of ground, as if that were unexampled among high
rates. The North Birmingham, at Steiglitz (Vic.), has
been opened up by tributors who prospected through
hard country and got the reef, giving 20 per cent, tribute
to the co. The reef went about 5 ozs., but it being small
(some 8 to 12in. wide) they just cleared wages. Their
time expiring, the 00. has obligingly offered it now at
50 per cent, tribute to 2 ozs.! and 70 percent, over 2 ozs.!
—the tributors to find blasting material, and pay for
hauling and crushing; yet even at that price some
tributors are taking it. Times must be bad indeed. This
percentage, I fancy, puts up a record, and reflects more
credit on the directors than it does on those who accepted
the terms.—Trirutor, Vic. Which only shows that every
miner is a gambler at heart. “Hope burns eternal.”

Dear Bulletin, —The North Phoenix gold-mine
(Gympie, Q.) has a record hard to beat. It has been
working for 16 or 17 years and paying dividends regularly
every three weeks for about 15 years. No investor ever
lost money by buying into it. The price of shares gradu-
ally rose to £lO, and more gradually fell to present price,
about £2. Buyers at the maximum, who are now holders,
have received a handsome profit. It is the only mine 1
know of the shares in which were not boomed beyond
their value at any time. It was taken up by miners who
worked in the mine and formed their own directorate.
Shortly alter gold was struck dividends as higli as
Bs. were paid. That could not be helped as only rich ore
was in view ; but as soon as the mine was opened out and
poorer ore could be raised the dividends were reduced to
35., which were paid regularly for several years.; then
2s. 6d., then 25., and so on gradually until they are now
reduced to 6d. A better or more honestly worked mine
was never opened in Australia. The original shareholders
were satisfied with and proud of their property, developed
hy the labour of their own hands. The original directors
retain their shares to this day. William Smyth, M.L.A.
for Gympie, was the first manager and largest share-
holder. For the past fourteen years it lias been managed
by George Argo. An inspection of the underground
workings would impress anyone with what ability and
judgment the work has been done. Some years ago it
was decided to make the shaft three-chambered. Argo
put the additional chamber down 400 ft., through hard
rock, without stopping the regular work of the mine in
the other chambers of the shaft for a single shift, and
without the slightest mishap. The directors and manager
deserve credit for their honourable conduct in the manage-
ment. Many a time they could have declared a 10s. div,
in place of 29. 6d., sold at enhanced price, and bought in
again at the reduced value certain to follow on the divs.
Neman ever cursed the North Phoenix. Of bow many
gold mines can that be said?— Anon.

FUNNY IRISH BLUNDERS.
The native of the Green Isle who said, “It’s
a great comfort to be left alone when your
sweetheart is with you,” and the Irish auctioneer
who, while praising some goods he was offering
for sale, exclaimed, “ These are just the things I
should like to buy for my wife if she were a-
widow,” made very witty bulls. Equally good,
but even more complicated, was that perpetrated
by the exile in America, who pathetically ex-
pressed himself thus : “ Sure an’ if I live till I die,
an’ God knows whether I will or not, I’ll visit
ould Oireland afore I lave Pbiladelfy.” A funnier
blunder still, was that made by a new-cbum
Hibernian, who was a passenger by the Southern
Express the other night. He alighted, with other
thirsty souls, at Mittagong, but lingered at the
bar, over his favourite nectar, longer than he
should, and only regained the platform in time te
see the tail-lights of the train by which lie intended
to have journeyed, receding from his view. For
a moment he was dumb with astonishment, and
then collecting all the energy and presence of
mind he was capable of exerting, he cried, “Hould
on there, ye blatherin’ engine; faix, there’s a,inan
on board of yo that’s left behind ! ” ' These
stories have all the true Irish ring about
them, and call up memories of the Irishman
who complained to his physician that he
“gave him so many drugs he was sick a long
time after he got well.” No one who has used
St. Jacobs Oil can make a similar complaint to
that; it never causes a man to “feel sick after he
is well,” St. Jacobs Oil is an external remedy
for the absolute cure of pain, and it leaves no ill
effects behind. After using it tlm rheumatic
patient leaves his bed, or throws away hjs crutches
and begins life again a new man. Hear what Mr.
E. W. Kirby, of Mort-street, Balmain, says about
it“ | wse St. Jacobs Oil for rheumatism, and
do not know what I should do without it. The
kind of work I am engaged in compels me to be
out in all weathers, and I often have to remain i»
wet clothes for hours together. The result is that
I get rheumatism badly in my back at times. I
find there is nothing equal to St. Jacobs Oil for
shifting it, and putting me all right again. Both
my wife and I look upon it as a real blessing,’
The voluntary testimony of thousands of snob
witnesses proves, that this marvellous remedy
possesses the confidence of all classes of the
community.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The face was 200 feet high. Fifteen heads of
water from a l|in. pipe, backed by a pressure of
200 yards, were how playing against the wash.
The ground was fairly rich. Butin dry weather
the water-supply was limited, and at such times
desperate efforts were needed to provide a dividend.
Theii the men were driven right up to the dan-
gerous wall. Many a time have I seen them run
for their liVes arid refuse to return. The directors
” sacked” as the matiager advised. At thetwenty-
irst inqriest the jury added a rider recommending
-hat dne man should do nothing but watch. At
;lie twenty-fifth they suggested the advisability of
iroviding him with a whistle.
, It had been raining the day before. It was
now ten o’clock. The manager was leaning
thoughtfully against the pipe, and from iris point
of Vantage surveyed operations. He seemed in a
strangely reflective mood this day. Anxiously he
scanned tlie face. Twice he ordered the men to
fall back., Okef and over again He consulted his
Watch; THeri lie abandoned hhriself to fevferie.

His thoughts went back to His school-days as
eye Rill ripon Heinrich, then at work in the
claim. They had grown up together. They had
dome but together. They had played cards in
company. Worse they had been rivals for
Christina’s dimpled hand. Henry got her aftef a
fierce struggle. Now, strange irony, he was
Henry’s boss; and he held in His hands the life
rind bread o‘f that unfortunate; Victory is the
bait that ensures defeat oftimes.
* * *
The manager was troubled. As he once more
gazed (ipon the face, a tiny bit bf earth fell from
a narrow ledge, 50ft. up. Should he sound the
alarm ? Ere he had decided, it flaked; A long,
narrow slice of about twelve tons peeled off,
and crirled downwards like a flash. It was a
whip of earth* It took Henry like a lasso;
from the hips down, and the result Was the
same as if you had placed the poor wretch Upon
an anvil, and pounded the lower portion of his
body into a jelly_ with sledge-hammers; His
massive form was limp enough now.
He was taken to the hospital. Boy as I was, I
noticed his hand clawing at his broken back. I
saw the curious light of madness in his beautiful,
blue eyes. I listened to his babble as he told his
mates to boil the billy and stop the Water. His
long yellow beard waved like a banner of distress.
I heard the screams of a broken-hearted wife as I
rushed away from the windows,
* « #
Of course, there were not wanting those who
said that the manager was not sorry. The directors
resolved unanimously to tie whistles round each
workman’s neck at the Co. ’s expense.
Time has rolled on. The butcher’s shop still
pays dividends, but the manager is single yet. Gall
and honey, soda and acid, each human life finds
its only pleasure in imagination. There is nothing

him asking permission to have a look at his beeches
—but it looked like “ breeches.” “ I don’t know
that there is anything the matter with them,”
wrote the Duke in reply, “ but you can judge for
yourself. I will send my valet with them.”
“ When the Last Bell Rings.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Have you ever watched the people
Who are gathered on the sward,
For some cup or famous steeple ?,
an anxious, sordid horde
Cluster round each equine lord
When the last bell rings !
What a mad, discordant chorus
Floats above the trampled way,
Harsh as though hell’s roof were porous,
And the demons, as they play,
Shouted “Six to one I’ll lay 1”
As the last bell rings.
How the ringmen deftly juggle
With thp surging, fatuous crowd,
In that space before the struggle
When they weave the fav’rite’s shroud,
Mid their clamour long and loud,
As the last bell rings.
What a hoisting into saddles
And a gathering of reins ;
As each horseman lightly straddles
Glossy skin, and net-like veins,
All undimmed with foam, or stains,
When the last bell rings.
Watching them, I often wonder,
As they step towards the gate
(Through the blatant Ring’s hoarse thunder),
Do they deem that in the straight,
Wealth and ruin some await,
When the last bell rings ?
Yet, it matters not, for horses
Are unlike their masters, men r
They know naught of crooked courses.
Owners wield the scratching pen,
Trainers stop their fleetness, when
The last bell rings.
Plungers, keen on “getting level,”
On some “ wonder ” pile their gold,
Yet the layers fairly revel,
For “ the wonder ” has been sold,
And the jockey will be told
When the last bell rings.
If you want a view of Hades
With its sin, but not its heat,
Graced by brass-band, bars, and ladies,
And a Governor and suite,
Rand wick should be hard to beat
When the last bell rings.
KENNETH MACKAY.
Out of nearly 8000 murderers in the
United States last year, over 20 per cent, were
total abstainers. The teetotaller, inflamed by
tracts and maddened by ginger-beer, is a fearsome
being when he starts to run amok.
Ex-Attorney-Gelleral Rutledge (Q.) was
originally a Methodist parson. He says that when
on one he married a couple, the groom
handed him a <HS-note, out of which he gave him
change. To his disgust he found, next day,
that the girl was under age, that the bridegroom
was already a married man, and (worst of all)
that the bank-note was a forgery.

After the Viaticum.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Yoil have done what is best for my soul’s last
flight,
But one pain gnaws at my weak heart yet;
Since I looked the last on my youth’s delight
Fifty red summers have risen and set.
“ The things of the world,” you may shake your
head —
You are skilled in the things of Heaven—What!
The fires in my shrunken veins are dead
Long ago—how long I have even forgot.
It is Love, the purest, I speak of now.
Do you see this tress from her young gold head?
I cut it one night from the queenly brow,
When she and I and the world were dead.
By the side of mine, how young it seems !
By the side of mine, the gold and the grey,
Yet, Father, in our time of dreams
These hairs were young together ; the grey
Were brown and alive with light like the gold,
Yet you see what the world has done to mine.
When we meet to-day, she young, I old,
How shall she say, “lam thine, you mine ?
And if she waits at the great gold gate
And looks at each guest with her starry eyes,
How shall she know me, coming so late, _
And coming at last in an old man’s guise?
• •••**
I think God mated us from the first,
When His fiat through virgin space was hurled,
Ere the first fish swam, or the first grain burst
From the uncouth breast of the steaming world.
But Death was stronger and tore her away,
Before I had more than kissed her mouth—
In the place you think I am going to-day
Shall I meet her and quench my soul’s long
drouth ?
You see, when Death made her sweet eyes mist
She whispered me, “ Dear, well meet again
Now, tell me, was that an idle tryst,
And have I waited so long in vain ?
“ I think too much of a human love,”
Well, if I am wrong then you may be right,
But if Heaven is Heaven, and God’s above,
She will keep her tryst with me to-night.
Sydney.
P. E. QUINN.
A sign of the times is a little English
volume of poetry by the Evening Man, who thus
laVenderises a title which does not sound so plea-
sant, He goes about, at a very late hour, sitting
on a square iron cart, in London. He writes a
solemn poem on the horizontal souls —the millions
asleep! Another is on one of his craft who
fainted in Rimmel’s perfumery. Driving his
“ well-replete ” cart, in the dark hour before dawn
adown a “populous gorge” in one of the thick
aristocratic suburbs, with a perceptible aroma of
Araby the Blest from the flower gardens, the
Evening Man thought out his Lines to Millicent,
his one fair daughter, whom he “ folds in his fond
embrace.” He also has an Ode to the Turkish
Bath.
The constable recently bitten by the leper
Joe, at Geraldton, Q., has developed siloh un-
favourable symptoms that he has been forwarded
to Brisbane for treatment.
Home-ruler Healy once convulsed the
Commons (where you aren’t supposed ever to open
your mouth save by command of one of the whips)
by his persistent attempts to speak. The subject
under discussion was pigs, and Healy, after many
turbulent attempts to be heard, roared, “Sir, I say!
Damn it, sir! if there’s anything I do know any-
thing about, it is pigs, sir ! ” and, amidst roars of
laughter, he went right ahead.
Dear Bulletin, —ln reply to “The
Orphan’s ” question : “If a snake be held up by
the tail, has it power to turn upwards as far as
the hand so as to bite?” just let me say that no
one, except a gentle idiot with a burning wish to
be instantly and effectively bitten, would hold any
snake in such a manner; and this rule applies to
any snake, from the largest Pseudechis down to a
ten-inch Vermicella. Just let “The Orphan” try
it.—Yours, H. J. M‘Oooey. Burragorang, 10th
Nov.
“ The original deed of conveyance ” of the
site of Duttigalla from Jagga-Jagga and other
chiefs to John Batman, was lately advertised for
sale by a London bookseller at .£25. A palpable
absurdity ! The original is in Dr. Bride’s safe at
Melbourne Public Library. The London docu-
ment is not even a duplicate, but may possibly be
a copy. The duplicate was destroyed by J. F.
Gellibrand, legal adviser of the Settlement
Association (afterwards lost with Hesse, near
Birregurra, Vic., while exploring), in a fit of
rage at learning of Governor Bourke’s refusal
to recognise the conveyance as valid. Gellibrand
was a great man in some respects, but fearfully
passionate. It was his temper that provoked the
fight with Alfred Stephen, and it is known that
his obstinacy drove him to continue on his fatal
expedition, when Hesse would have returned.
She was a caution, must have been that
“girl in the Karpathians not born 25 years
before—to travel alone in boy’s clothes, women’s
head-gear, hairpins, &0., no shoes or socks, sleep
out at night in the hay-shed along with the coach-
man, instead of in the house; smoke cigars and
“ shout ” for all hands at the Ideal pub, taking
care, by the way, td give them only beer—not
schnapps—so as to prolong the happy state of
getting drunk. Fairly strong as a modern sensa-
tionalist, but tame alongside of the climax wherein
these facts are chronicled and published in 300
well-worded pages of drivel—composed partly of
descriptions of the number of times she took off
her shirt to “shake out the insects ” —and of
several pages of the various diseases brought to
their native villages by young soldiers who have
served three years in the Austrian army on sd.
per day—and from whom it is naively stated
“ immorality ’’can only be expected because they
don’t know what morality means, as every man
lives with his own or “someone else’s wife.”
What a prize London Society must have in this
“ girl of the Karpathians” not born 25 years ago !
Two islands named Shandygaff and Porter-
gaff are offered for sale at the next Queensland
Government land-sales. They must have been
christened when Perkins was Minister of Lands.
According to the Tasmanian Democrat
a man was lately forced to go as bailiff into a
house because he had the bailiffs in at his own.
He then shared his fees with the people he was
levying on.
Down around Albury these flood times,
some farmers, who are Victorian citizens over-
night, are N.S.W. citizens in the morning. So
far, the luck of exchange is in favour of N.S.W.,
and promises to heap up on that side in the near
future.
Particulars given by the N.Y. Herald
respecting the “ Damn Chicago ” trouble between
Sir George Dibbs and Colonel Campbell, are in-
tended to be favourable to Campbell, but rather
serve to extenuate Dibbs’ explosion. The N.Y.
Herald says that Colonel Campbell is “ the
mildest of men under ordinary circumstances, but
has inherited some of the combative temperament
of his father, Bishop Campbell.” That explains a
lot. The military man, the Colonel, was of a
lamblike disposition, but when the blood of the
old Bishop was stirred up in him he would fight
the Devil.
Hobart possesses a “cure” in “Blind
Aliek,” the premier bottle-gatherer. Totally blind
from birth, Alick drives about the city, collects his
bottles, and with his wares drives hard bargains
with the dealers. He can tell a brandy-bottle—
when brandy is in it—from one that contains
“ soft stuff,” and he can give “ the stuff ” its name
every time. He can drive straight to any pub in
the city, and is a keen j udge of the characters he
meets in his rounds. Like the blind woodcutter
of Lefroy, he often drives a mile or two out of the
city to cut firewood and cart it in. “ Couldn’t
see any better, old woman,” is his invariable
answer if his aged mother grumbles at the quality
of the wood. ~He has a keen appreciation of
feminine society, and is very fickle in his wooing.
*• Oh, she’s a much nicer looking gal than the last
one,” he will reply when “chaffed” about his
latest conquest.
The projected revival of whaling in these
waters suggests to a correspondent the enquiry,
“ What has become 6f the Emily Downing, one of
Alexander M‘Gregor’s (of Hobart) old whaling
fleet?” Built for the Imperial Government in
1842, by convicts at Port Arthur* she was origin-
ally named the Lady Franklin, and was employed
as a transport between Hobart and Tasman’s
Peninsula, and Tasmania and Norfolk Island.
In December, 1853, while on a trip to the “Hell
of the Waters ” she was seized by convicts, and
the story of her subsequent adventures will shortly
be told by “Price Waning” from details fur-
nished by a soldier of the guard, Captain
Welletts, who was in command of the vessel, and
one of the convicts concerned in the emeute.
Marcus Clarke, in “His Natural Life,” artisti-
cally wrecks the vessel, but, as a fact, she was, on
the cessation of transportation, sold by the Go-
vernment to Downing and De Giares, joint-
adventurers in whaling, who re-named her the
Emily Downing. In the Sixties “old Aleck”
bought her, and she made some of the most pro-
fitable voyages ever run by a locally-owned craft.
The Warden Death.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“An inquest was held yesterday on the body of Williatr
Dyson* miner, who, after a continued run of ill-fortune,
suicided by shooting. The jury returned the usual
verdict.”— Barrier Paper.
Years I have mined life’s barren lands,
And little save sorrow the clean-up yields,
But the Warden Death has placed in my hands
A Miner’s Right to eternal fields.
Shallow the sinking to reach the bed,
Six by two is the statute ground,
And never a fee is paid by the dead
After the Warden has made his round.
Should I reject the boon he gives,
Scorn, when we meet, I would see in his eyes ;
For a tenure uncertain is his who lives,
And a claim unjumpable his who dies.
Broken Hill.
CHAS. A. CAMERON.
Madame Carnot smokes cigarettes.
Three-fourths of the hotels in England
belong to brewers. It wouldn’t be worth while
calling a man a romancer if he said that all tho
Sydney pubs, belong to them.
“News,” according to editor Cockerell,
late of the New York World, “is any hitherto
imprinted occurrence which involves a violation
of the Ten Commandments.” Anybody who has
a better definition than that will please send it
along.
William Miles has been shot at Albany
(W.A.) by a Chinaman named Patrick Brown.
Also, another Chow has opened a hash-establish-
ment at Wellington (ALL.),, and calls it the
Caledonian boarding-house. This is too much.
Anatole France, in a new volume of
essays, has an odd one. He depicts Pilatb, in old
age, gouty, at the seaside resort of Raise, where a
debauched venerable comes to enquire about Mary
Magdalen, but Pontius remembers scarcely aught
—even aboitt the Messiah.
The London Times has taken to eulogising
Daniel O’Connell, the Irish liberator, and it
intimates that if the blatant, murderous Home
Ruler of to-day were only like that great and
good man of old, the Irish cause would prosper, and
even the Times would smile upon it. Fifty-five
years ago, that paper published a poem about
O’Connell, which started thus :
Scum condensed of Irish bog!
Ruffian, coward, demagogue!
Boundless liar, base detractor !
Nurse of murders, treason’s factor !
The Tory paper always tries to get up a bogus
aspect of Liberalism by cheering for the patriot
who is dead, and damning the patriot who is
alive. In another half-century the Times will be
rising to point out that it is only because the
Radicals of 1942 are not like that pure and lofty
hero Parnell, that it doesn’t rise and take them to
its bosom with enthusiasm.
