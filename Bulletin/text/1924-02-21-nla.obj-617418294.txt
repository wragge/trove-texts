P GYPTI AN History records the popular beverage
known as Beer was brewed the first time in Thebes
about 1525 8.C., in the reign of Amenophis I. of
Dynasty XVIII. This gentleman reigned some years
before the once again famous Tutankhamen.

Do try to visualise the first brew-house, and compare
it with the equipment of the modern Brewery produc-
ing STAG LAGER, which is brewed from the purest
ingredients and matured in GLASS-LINED tanks.
Shakspeare makes Macbeth say in one of his convivial moods:
“Now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both!” These
words should be appreciated every day when lunching or dining,
when the zest of the meal is enhanced by a glass of STAG LAGER.

The Red Page
Possessed of Devils
The mysterious death of Aylmer Jorkins
created an extraordinary sensation at the
time. He died in circumstances that pro-
voked public amazement \ and kept medical
men in stupefied discussion for months.
Apparently he had in some manner blown
up ; but, though doctors in relays inspected
the body, and a detective with a trained
scent for explosives pinned his nose to the
corpse, Jorkins’s strangely rent stomach,
with its curious resemblance to a mouth
opening in a bellow of laughter, remained
a challenge to science. I alone can explain
his death. I was there when the awful
event happened.
I first met him at the premidre of that
voluble musical comedy, “Sweet, Swishy
Susie,” which he had to commend in cere-
monious platitudes for the Daily Swindle.
We were introduced by a mutual acquaint-
ance, and I became immediately interested
in his personality. He was one of those
pale, faraway men —a dreamer whose only
solace is himself. He hated the theatre, he
said. He detested the cowardly collabora-
tion of dressmakers, scene-painters and
musical jinglers trying to make obvious the
rakings of manicure parlors and beauty com-
petitions. He disapproved of a thousand
other things, and put his views with a mis-
anthropic saturninity. I think he liked me
from the first, because he took me early
into his confidence, gradually opening the
doors to the recesses of his reticence until
one evening he told me his disturbing secret.
After the theatre we had been walking
through the streets in a mellow glow of
reminiscence, and, coming to his door, where
we usually parted, he swung on me and said
nervously: “Come in, old man. There is
something I want to tell you.” Surprisedly
I assented, and followed him upstairs to his
room, where there were the usual signs of
a preoccupied tenant. He cleared away
some of the disorder, sat me in a chair, took
the bed and opened with the remark: “Old
chap, I am beset by devils.” He saw the
inquiry framing in my startled eyes, and
without more ado he plunged on:
“Yes, I am beset by devils. Almost every
night for the past three months I have been
possessed by literary phantoms which hold
the pen in my fingers and set me writing
in the way their own thoughts run. I am
unable to escape, unable to offer an effective
resistance. The first oue was Henry James.
Knowing me as an admirer, he seized me
when I was on the point of starting a novel.
There was no apparition, no visible evi-
dence of his presence, but I suddenly felt
that I had been coated over with some cold,
glutinous substance, and that my hands had
lost their function. I saw my right hand,
defiant of remonstrance, trace slowly, in a
delicate script, words that would never be
my own. When he left me after an hour or
more, I was as one who had been drained of
all volition, and I stared blankly at a sheet
of manuscript which I would like you to
read.”
He rummaged in a drawer /of his table
and produced the following:—
In the sedateness of her suave surrender, Miriam
had immeasurably achieved the not quite complex,
if not quite simple, success of exposing with a grace,
that bordered as little on gravity as it was removed
from the abyss of self-sufficiency, the somewhat
pardonable pretence of Cedric’s affectionate gestures
in endeavoring to maintain, with a high and mighty
air, the dominance of a personality dismissing the
lowly in favor of the ineffable. She experienced the
congestion of thoughts and feelings; she had held
a white flag in the breach of her reserve when he
had come, like a veritable Crusader for the last
gallant assault ; but in the gathering brightness of
a nonchalance, that had surged over her, triumphantly
endowing her with a felicity that was beyond her
computation, whilst armoring her for the sweetest
passions of a well-found life, she assured herself that
the abundant opportunities for communion would be
fruitful of fortuitous disintegrations of pusillanimity
deadened, and vain glory denied, in the solemnifying
education of two twin minds.
Knowing nothing of Henry James, I
observed, “How like James!” and handed
the paper back.
“Yes,” Jorkins continued, “that’s James.
He pestered me over a month, sometimes
talking, sometimes writing, ever lofty and
tortuous. But one night he left me abruptly,
and I became aware of a new ghost which
had a faint odor of a scented cigarette. As
soon as the dim, golden voice began, I knew
it was Oscar Wilde. He had several con-
versations with me. He told me that all
writing was tedious. Even his own was use-
less because it conferred on him the stigma
of intelligence, and he wished to be regarded
as an Englishman of leisure. Talking of
modern writers, he assured me that Arnold
Bennett made a man slipping on a banana-
skin loom up like a railway accident or a
Cabinet crisis. He further declared that
Wells was an industrious fossicker in the
rag-and-bone tip of discarded philosophies,
and that Bernard Shaw had made it his pain-
ful duty to transform the First of April
into the Fifth of November and vice versa.
Wilde also took my hand in his and wrote
the opening of a preposterous story com-
mencing with the words: ‘The bad die young.
The good remain to make life unbearable
to the simple-minded!’ Wilde was a per-
fumed tyrant—but there was worse to come!
See here”—and Jorkins tossed over a frag-
ment written in this wise:—
He swung her to his saddle-bow, his red eyes
aslant, for she was a puissant maid and the desired
of Aquitaine. He went on into the forest, a valiant
knight, and the place where his body was found is
marked “X” in the accompanying photograph.
“That’s quaint, isn’t it?” he remarked.
“Yes, astounding,” I admitted.
“Well, listen,” spoke Jorkins in a voice
growing deeper with perturbation. “After
Wilde left I had a visit from Maurice Hew-
lett. He was a dignified if jealous master,
and he set me on a tale to be called ‘The
Red Heart of Aquitaine.’ However, he had
hardly penned the first sentence before I was
conscious of a monstrous internal commo-
tion, and I beheld my hand shaping in a
sort of shrill caligraphy: ‘The place where
his body teas found is marlced “X ” in the
accompanying photograph .’
“Do you know what has happened?” he
whispered with a shudder. “I have swal-
lowed Lord Northcliffe!”
“Swallowed Northcliffe?” I echoed incre-
dulously.
“Yes. Disdaining a mere external posses-
sion like the others, he leapt into my inside
in a brutal desire for my soul. For five
nights he has been struggling to make it
his, but sooner than yield to that yellow
journalist I will suffer any torture he may
devise.”
I got up to leave. Jorkins was clearly
mad.
“Don’t go, don’t go,” he begged. “Don t
leave me.” The wretched writer seemed
torn with internal dissensions. He twiddled
and writhed, his mouth gibbering incoher-
encies, his eyes glistening, while he spun
and spun with a sickening momentum. I
strove to hold him, but he was wrenched
out of my grasp, and I was hurled to the
wall dazed and bleeding. While I was trying
to get erect the end came. Jorkins’s eyes
stood out of his head as if to measure fully
some approaching terror. His waistcoat,
billowing oddly in a fashion I could not
fathom, suddenly ripped open, and in the
last haze preceding unconsciousness I saw
the scatter of entrails, I felt a rush of wind,
and heard a chant of unearthly merriment.”
When I came to Jorkins was dead. His
stomach had been burst open by the trium-
phant Northcliffe. Also there was further
suggestive evidence of Northcliffe’s victory.
On the ceiling was a stain in the shape of
a seraph at prayer. I knew it was poor
Jorkins’s soul.
It was yellow'.

Zarathustra
In a recent Red Page article Mr. Adrian
Lawlor, who appears to be one of the fathers
and confessors of the anti-Christian faith,
suggests, by way of antidote to the poison
of Christian morality, that Nietzsche should
be exhibited when the Australian youth lias
arrived at the age of 18, and before his
native Immoralism has been utterly sapped
and destroyed. It is a good suggestion from
the Zarathustrian point of view; but there
are difficulties. Would Mr. Lawlor exhibit
Nietzsche neat or dilute? If neat, which
Nietzsche? It has been calculated that there
are 32 of them —-one, that is, for every point
of the ethical compass. But, indeed, _ this
was a work of supererogation. “This thinker
needs no one to confute him; he suffices to
that end himself.” Thus spake Zarathustra.
The difficulty of the mere understanding of
Nietzsche is very serious—not, perhaps, for
persons of Mr. Lawlor’s intellectual stature,
but for us others. A case in point. Iloff-
ding, the German philosopher, and the
Danish man of letters, Georg Brandes, car-
ried on for years a controversial war about
Nietzsche. Year in, year out they differed
diametrically as to what the true meaning
was on every point of the ethic of super-
mania that came up for discussion —with
one exception. This single point about
which they could agree was that Nietzsche
most certainly opposed eudaemonism. It
was afterwards shown to the satisfaction
of both, as Iloffding tells us, that he was an
enthusiastic eudaemonist. But had they got
the whole truth then ? I trow not: he was
both opponent and supporter, and 30 other
things as well. The Australian youth may
well be excused if he should boggle at the
thought of plunging into a philosophic pit
from which Hdffding and Brandes were, with
the best illwill in the world, unable to extri-
cate each other.
But, as if intellectual obstacles to the pro-
pagation of the faith were not enough, the
pious anti-Christian is brought to utter
shame by the fact that Nietzsche allowed
his own conduct in private life to be gov-
erned, even to the point of asceticism, by
the Christian ethic. Somewhere —I think it
is in “Ecce Homo” —Nietzsche asserts that
he was an atheist even in infancy—an in-
born, instinctive atheist. No idea of God
had ever for a single instant polluted his
mind. Here we see the danger of taking
your Nietzsche neat. For, in actual fact,
the young Zarathustra was no atheist. He
was a pious, God-fearing, little German boy,
a model, as he continued to be through life,
of “the Christian vices” —charity, chastity,
honesty, truthfulness, temperance to the
pussyfoot point, and all the rest. He was
called by his schoolmates “the little min-
ister” ; and he seems to have had even the
power to work miracles upon them, inas-
much as obscene and coarse language and
jokes were repressed in his presence. Later,
when he and his most intimate youthful
friend, Dcussen, received their first Com-
munion; both were overcome by a feeling of
holiness and ecstasy. Nietzsche was then
about 17. At 20 he matriculated at Bonn
as a student in divinity and philosophy. He
made a gallant attempt to live up to the
beer and brawls and duels of his fellow-
students, but soon found himself heartily
sick of them, and made no bones about avow-
ing it. Once he even allowed himself to
be persuaded to visit a house of questionable
character. His gorge rose at the mere "sight
of the place and the people there. He
turned away, and left incontinently—and
continent. Professor Deussen says of him,
“Mulierem nunquam attigit”; and, though
no one but a German professor would be
guileless enough to make such a statement
dogmatically about the morals of another
man, it was probably true not only at that
time but throughout Nietzsche’s life. After
1879 he became a chronic invalid in body,
and, as I think, in mind, wandering from
place to place in Germany, Switzerland and
Italy in a futile search for relief from eye-
strain and agonising headaches. In the
early days of January, 1889, he had an
apoplectic seizure. From this he woke hope-
lessly insane. His reason was never re-
stored, and lie died in 1900. The Italian
peasants, who came to know Nietzsche well,
used to speak of him as il santo (the saint),
and il piccolo santo (the little saint), and
they were right. Nietzsche was a Christian
saint gone wrong. He had much more in
common with Savonarola than with Csesare
Borgia, one of his “immortally healthy, im-

mortally cheerful and well-constituted"
supermen. .„ .
Max Nordau was, as I think, right in say-
ing that Nietzsche’s mind was never normal;
and I believe that, after 1879, in his books,
and even in his private letters, there are
signs of mental trouble. It seems probable
that he was definitely insane, with intervals,
during the first four months of the last half
of 18S8 —that is, while writing “The Case
of Wagner,” “The Twilight of the Idols,_
“Dionysos Dithyrambs” and “The Anti-
Christ” —and certain that he was so after
the middle of October, when he began work
on the autobiographical “Ecce Homo.” I
venture the opinion that not a single alienist
now living will say that this book was written
by a sane man. Take the opening sen-
tences on the very first page:—
The happiness of mj r existence, its unique charac-
ter perhaps, consists in its fatefulness; to speak in
a riddle, as my own father lam already dead, as
my own mother I still live and grow old. This
double origin, taken as it were from the highest and
lowest rungs of the ladder of life, at once a
decadent and a beginning, this, if anything, explains
that neutrality, that freedom from partisanship in
regard to the general problem of existence, which
perhaps distinguishes me. To the first indications
of ascending or of descending life my nostrils are
more sensitive than those of any man that ever
lived.
This excerpt gives but a poor idea of the
matter and manner of “Ecce Homo.” Yet
Georg Brandes calls it a work of surpass-
ing greatness, and nearly all the biographers
aver that it is as sanely and coherently
written as any of Nietzsche’s other books.
If so, so much the worse for the other books.
For not only is there internal evidence of
megalomania on every page, but a piece of
external evidence came to light in l.)14
which, if credible, is conclusive. In that
year Frau Forster Nietzsche, who thereto-
fore had been vehement for the sanity and
sanctity of the whole Nietzsche canon, stated
iu the Berliner Tageblatt that when writ-
ing “Ecce Homo” her brother was out ot
his mind.
HENRY MOLONY.
The Blessed Word Mespot
According to Jack Lindsay (B. 31/1/24),
when an animal (in this case the ordinary
human being) becomes “refined,” he will
“turn with a snarl on all that defines an
active condition of beauty”—the Lindsay
definition of beauty, that is. Worse still,
the creature is likely to become irrespon-
sible and to return to the blood lusts ol
the jungle from which it has so lately
escaped. To an unenlightened Philistine it
would seem merely reasonable to keep the
savage beast, fortunately so far tamed and
restrained, away from the rich and luscious
feasts which the Lindsay school spreads so
enticingly before the world’s view. buch
well-cooked and nicely-served dietary, accom-
panied by appropriate music, can only be
lit for ripe minds that have winged their
flight beyond poor civilisation, and have
reached a sphere insulated from any cor-
rupting influences. As Mr. Lindsay insists,
they must in this remarkable flight have
reached heights whence tenderness, goodwill
and generosity can be regarded from such an
elevation that they reveal themselves as
attributes meriting only the utmost con-
tempt. To those god-like minds there seems
to come no realisation of pain, sickness or
death. Kindly, sympathetic feelings to-
wards these facets of life, which cannot be
evaded, are regarded scornfully as “drawing-
room” sentimentalities. Red Blood and
White Flesh, “breasts like ivory fruits,
appear to be the sole provender_ on which
they train themselves for the exercise of pens,
pencils and ink. . .
But what are' they really striving for.' 1
What is the driving force? What is the
dominant idea? “Passion” is so deified in
the Lindsay mind that it seems a contradic-
tion in terms to ask some member of the
tribe for a dispassionate explanation. If
the Lindsay viewpoint is entirely personal,
why thrust it so persistently on an unsym-
pathetic and mostly mud-fishy world? If it
is propaganda, what exactly do they want
to bring about? In the chaos of wild abstrac-
tions, “Beauty,” “Truth,” “Passion,” “Life”
appear to be the catchwords. They seem
to a mere Philistine to be used rather as
punctuation marks than as actual words, or
at best to possess in the Lindsay psychology
the same soothing sense of comprehensive-
ness that the blessed word Mesopotamia held
in the mind of the godly old lady. Have
the Lindsays any new definition of them?
Is there any coherent or explainable plan or
objective in the Lindsayan frenzy of words,
in the dazzling display of Piccadilly ladies
with a smirk, in the demons and sprites and
deformed apes and other decadent appendages
which disfigure the exquisite and beautiful
craftsmanship of the greatest Lindsay of them
all? In the Lindsayan scheme —if scheme it
be—there is a monotonous reiteration of one
theme and in one key only. No gentler
gradations, none of the subtler light and
play of tenderness, of sweetness, of nobility ;
no flowers or trees are recognised except as
a background for “Passion.” A remark by
Mrs. Ponderevo in “Tono Bungay” floats dis-
respectfully into one’s mind: “Old passion’s
all very well, George, in its way—hut this
is old nonsense.” Is it a crime in Lind-
sayan eyes to hold the view that in this
wide world there are other objects of graci-
ousness and charm which transcend even the
appeal of a beautifully proportioned form?
Are we Philistines to be damned inevitably
and eternally if we feel bored by an ever-
lasting procession of unclothed ladies?
Nature may abhor a vacuum, but poor
humanity expresses its abhorrence of a sur-
feit in the concise phrase, “Fed up.” Is
one ever allowed to feel fed up with the
Lindsayan insistance on the merits of the
female chest, ivory fruits and all?
From logical questioning I have come
down to a craving for information. Can
anyone explain?
R. DARTLE.
Two Heretics of St. Venus
I am sorry if I seemed to infer (“Venus
and the Primitive Beast,” R.P. 31/l/’24)
that there was anything personal in David
McKee Wright’s emotion towards myself or
any of the anthologists. I was analysing
Wright as the creature of a universal emo-
tion, his hostility as the outburst of a sub-
conscious strata of rage against all in the
chords.
anthology that moved towards passionate
beauty. That sex is the crux here must not
be taken to mean that there is
material for art. Macbeth, Tu
“Ulysses,” Wagner’s Siegfried Idyll and
Beethoven’s “Third Symphony would be
sufficient to refute any such assumption, mtt
since Art is the power to give dynamic form
to sensation, Love with its eternal variation
emotion and gesture, the inexhaustible imi * y
of the embrace which produces lute, must
be the central profundity of uH P° etr y , T -,
said nothing of “sweet, cleanly things,
they only exist under the sincerity ot se -
knowledge. I said that all abstract emo-
tions represented the animal’s sense ot a need
for pacification, of escape from the menace
of his blood. Therefore, those who seek
abstract emotions are those who need to
escape all that stirs too strongly.
As to my never having seen Titian s Danae,
it is pure cant to assert that a good repro-
duction of a picture (incomparably nearer
to the original than any gramophone record
to its) cannot fulfil the purpose of giving
one the completed emotion of that picture.
Since it is the mental impulse recorded in
paint that is sought (something basic, not
in the paint itself, but in the defined forms),
then a mental stimulus can be drawn from
the reproduction that will serve almost as
well as that from the original. I have never
seen any Titian originals. Does that mean
that the very real sense of beauty and joy
that stands for Titian in my mind has no
existence? Only the utmost pedantry could
argue thus.-
McKee Wright, however, has the honesty
to pdt his name to his utterances. The per-
son writing under the pseudonym Henri
Singemoine” (R.P. same ,'ssue) may
have chosen that name from a sub-
conscious sense of its fitness. ( Singemoine =
Monkey-monk), for he combines a simian
attitude to life with moral hatred. I hardly
like even to touch this mind, so unclean is
it. What can be said to the man who
thinks instinctively of the Marquis de Sade
when he meets the term “dreams of desire !
This is what is called psycho-analytically the
Association Test. What possible connection
can that feeble fury of the neurotic animal
in the last gasps of its vitality, Sadism,
have to do with the projection of a gay
image of beauty? That he shamelessly in-
troduces a miserable imbecile like. Puddifoot
in order to awake popular prejudice and
make a disingenuous effort to dirty my
words, leaves me speechless. Can he really
believe that the automatic aberrations of a
moron have any relation whatever to the dis-
ciplined power to react to an “emotion ot
loveliness”? Does he really think that
Sappho, Praxiteles, Titian, Shakspeare,
Rubens. Burns, Byron. Beethoven, Wagner
and Rodin (to take only the most signifi-
cant names) were “weaklings,” liable at any
moment to commit rape? The achievements
of Shakspeare, Beethoven and Wagner,, more
than any others, show the preoccupation ot
the creative mind with the laughing dance ot
naked girls, the throbbing ecstasy that sweeps
through life to find
The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch
Which hurts and is desired.
Here is the emotion of loveliness I intended.
If McKee Wright insists on applying it to
a mythological caveman or to the mastodon,
and “H.S.” to whatever disgusting and fur-
tive images spring »ip in his mind whenever
the word sex is mentioned, it is not my
fault. That they cannot conceive of desire
and beauty except in terms of frenzied bru-
tality and savagery is also not my fault.
Still, however appalling is the thought that
one must offer one’s work to a world made
up of monkeys and ttionks, one can always
thank the gods for that immortal figure ot
courage, Beethoven, and take the revenge on
man of listening to a few of his annihilating
JACK LINDSAY.
Three Works of Art
London lias the softness of a ruby: it
glows. Paris flashes and glitters: it is
hard like a diamond. Paris is all sparkle
and gaiety: it is swift-moving, unsympa-
thetic; it is for the lifeful and the young.
London is slower and softer: it has a sug-
gestion of almost surly friendliness about
it • it is a city more for the middle-aged.
In’ Paris the visibility is wonderful. The
Arc de Triomphe seems close upon you, until
you start to walk towards it. In London
the Nelson monument seems miles away, and
you are surprised how quickly you cotne to
it The murkiness in the atmosphere softens
the outlines of the old smoke-blackened
buildings, makes feathery the trees in the
parks, and throws a softening halo about
the street lights when night comes down.
Whenever I think of Paris now I see the
brilliantly-lighted cafes on the streets, and
the eye-catching advertisements of flowing
liciuid gold, and the Opera House illuminated
by violet flood-lights, and the myriads of
black, glaring-eyed motor-cars hasting down
the shining, wind-swept, brilliantly-lighted
boulevards. And by day there are the
multi-colored newspaper kiosks beneath the
trees in front of the cafes, and the green
trams, and the rumbling, green, blunt-snouted
’buses, and the Seine with its huge barges
and fussy steamboats and Corot trees in the
distance, and men of all ages fishing from
its banks with ridiculously long rods for
ridiculously small fish; and ever the Eiffel
Tower in the distance, and the Arc de
Triomphe down at the end of those converg-
ing rows of trees that line the Avenue des
Champs-Elysees. .
But whenever I think of Pans there are
three things that stand out in my mind be-
fore all the others. The brilliant city only
serves as a background for them. They are
the Venus de Milo standing against the black
background down at the end of that passage
in the Louvre; Rodin’s “Le Penseur,” grey-
green beneath the young trees in the garden
of the Rodin Museum; and the little blue
and ruby rose-window high up in the shadows
of the roof of Notre Dame.
Notre Dame is a very grey church, a
church of shadows, and the grey columns
holding up the roof in it are tremendously
suggestive of a mysterious forest where all
manner of strange beyond-folk abide. Notre
Dame has a truly religious atmosphere about
it that, to my mind, the more ornate, solidly-
built Church of the Madeleine totally lacks.
And that little blue and ruby rose-window
glowing down from the roof shadows of Notre
Dame is like a rich and very beautiful jewel
“Le Penseur” used to sit crouched up on
his pedestal before the Pantheon, but he has
been moved, and is now in the garden of
the Rodin Museum. And there he certainly
seems far more at home. There were no
cities in the world when that primitive man
first fell into that attitude. It is man start-
ing to think, and a great anguish is upon
him, the anguish that has driven him to
think. Hitherto sufficient and totally trusted,
action has now for the first time wholly
failed. Man has been thinking ever since—
thinking and thinking and thinking.
That beautiful Venus is thinking, too. I
have gazed upon her for hours trying to
fathom her mystery. She has in a very
marked degree that essential quality that
great Art shares with greater Nature —that
elusive suggestiveness that calls you on and
on and will not allow you to approach too
near. You see between the trees the beauti-
ful blue of the valley, and you go down
through the trees to get into closer touch
with that blue, and it has gone. It is the
same with the smile of the Monna Lisa.
Study and analyse that first impression
you take of the Venus de Milo, and it lias
gone too. All you know is that there is a
suggestion of infinite sadness about the beau-
tiful, graceful thing. It seems as if this
woman has known the greatest tragedy that
can be known, and survived, and now watches
with just a faint little passing interest —
possibly some small children at play.
It seems a far cry from the. Venus de Milo
to the “Miserere” from “II Trovatore,” but
both these works of art seem to suggest much
the same thing. They both take one down
with their sadness to the greatest depths to
which human emotions can sink, so that the
better will be revealed the heights to which
those human emotions may rise.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
A Satchel of Books
Devil Dare, by Alfred Ollivant (Heinemann).
Hectic novel of the Napoleonic period. In one
badly-contrived scene Boney lands surreptitiously on
the English coast and talks absurdly to an impossible
traitor.
The Thing at Their Heels, by Harrington Hext
(Thornton Buttenvorth). Ingenious mystery-yarn
relative to a vast British estate. There are four
thrilling murders, a natural death, and a confession
which is a real surprise.
The American Mercury. The first issue is less
concerned with letters than J. C. Squire’s famous
London publication is. George Jean Nathan and 11.
L. Mencken, the editors, are cosmopolitans with a
lively interest in the social, political and artistic
life of Europe, and their predilections are reflected
in their magazine. James Branch Cabell, Theodore
Dreiser and other front-rank American writers are
contributors.
The New Arabian Nights, by R. L. Stevenson.
The Tusitala edition of the works of Robert Louis
Stevenson will run, when complete, to 35 volumes
at 2s. 6d. apiece. Each booklet is to be prefaced
by hitherto undisclosed details of the writer’s life,
contributed by relations and friends. Thus Volume
1., which contains “The New Arabian Nights,” dis-
closes that London, a weekly of the ’nineties in
which these stories originally appeared, was often
written entirely by W. E. Henley, the editor, and
Stevenson. It died a little later for lack of readers.
Kings of Arabia, by Colonel Jacob (Mills and
Boon). The author has been First Assistant to
the Resident of Aden and chief political adviser on
S -W. Arabia to Lord Allenby. His book says little
about the kings of the desolate region he knows so
we ll—an illiterate and barbaric lot, with a few
exceptions—but a great deal about British methods
of handling Arabs; and he offers many suggestions
as to how those methods might, be bettered.
Amongst other things this discursive and charmingly-
written volume is a fairly comprehensive history o.
Aden from its capture by Captain Haines
Indian Navy, in 1839, to the present day.
The Peaks of Simla, by Rose Wilder Lane (Chap-
man and Dodd). A first-hand account of life among
the Albanians, the remarkable people who for 20
centuries have held their hills against success c
hordes of invaders. “Up in those mountains, says
one of Miss Lane’s friends, a day s
here, the people are living as they lived before t
Greeks or the Romans or the Slavs were hea •
There are prehistoric cities up there. So the tau}
goes to the mountains and runs into a blood
and other interesting local phenomena.
Political Crime , by W. G. Carlton Hall. A short
elucidation of the laws of treason, treason felon?,
misprision of treason, and allied offences. ine
writer concludes that, “under present conditions,
prosecutions for treason felony, seditious conspiracy,
seditious libel and the like do very little good anil
a good deal of actual harm.” lie suggests that
“all statutes dealing with directly political offences
be drastically revised, and the bulk of them re-
pealed,” and that the State should lay itself out
to penalise those “who planned and instigated the
rising, while themselves remaining safely in the
background, rather than their dupes, often meie
bovs, whom chance happens to bring into such a
position that they can be proved to have fired a
fatal shot.” This is sound in equity and logic.
The Treason Felony Act was really out of date when
it was passed 70-odd years ago.
The House of Youth, by Maude Radford Warren
(Roberts and Mullens). An American “society
yarn. The chief pre-occupation of the young people
is hootch. The millionaire hero is introduced at
a dance showing his friends something new in
pocket-flasks:—
“ ‘Pitch your gaze hither,’ Blaine said; ‘nifty
little trick, eh ? You see this ornamental design m
the corner? Twist ’er off and you’re all ready for
a quick nip.’ ”
Blaine is too drunk to face the altar on the day fixed
for his wedding with Gorinna (a convincingly-drawn
neurotic —all charm and irresponsibility), and she
is arrested with a party of inebriates in a bootleg
raid. After many trials and tribulations they are
married and proceed to Europe, where they sober
up and engage in relief work. This appears to be
the chief moral of the story—that prohibition
America is the home of futility and drunkenness, and
that spiritual salvation must be sought outside it.
By Tigris and Euphrates, by E. S. Stevens (Hurst
and Blackett). The authoress describes the strange
and fertile land where numerous irreconcilable sects
pother over their dogmas whilst the new Iraq Gov-
ernment struggles to bring them together in some
form of political union. But it seems a hopeless
task. The vague word “Mohammedan” covers over
70 sorts of Dissenters. Then there are the Chris-
tians, Jews, Chaldeans, Yazidis (Devil-worshippers)
and various outsiders to add to the uproar. The
two most prominent parties among the followers of
the Prophet are the Sunnis and the Shiahs, and
the cleavage between them, originating in the mists
of legend, has gradually widened with the centuries
until they remain unanimous only about the virtues
of the Koran. There are over a million of each
crowd in Mesopotamia, and the benevolent British
control strives to keep them at peace, where the
previous master, the Turk, maintained his authority
by Orientalising the Hapsburg motto of “Divide et
impera.” Miss Stevens comes to the conclusion that
to give the country self-government in such condi-
tions would be to invite trouble. Even the best
educated of the natives are absurdly ignorant of
Western methods and habits of thought. She cites
the case of a well-born and courteous Baghdadi
who was one of the first to have the electric light
put in his house, but complained that it was a
nuisance because the man who had made the con-
nections had turned on the light and had forgotten
to come back and switch it off. It had never
occurred to him to touch the button at his bedside,
and so he had painfully endured the glare for several
weeks.

Wo/se/ey Suspension
the finest ever embodied in a motor car.
There is no record of a broken spring on a 7, 10, Ilf or
15 h.p. WOLSELEY. The arrangement of the springs
is such that severe road shocks do not commence at
the stiffest and strongest point of the spring and travel
to its weakest point where a fracture is occasioned,
but, because in the WOLSELEY this process is in-
verted, the shock is eliminated long before a vital part
can be reached.
distinguished by British reliability in
every detail of its construction.
Aside from its beauty and com-
fort, you enjoy in the Wolseley
the assurance that every graceful
line, every point of excellent finish
is the outward expression of a
great underlying strength, a won-
derful fund of reserve power.
The Wolseley is British from one
end to the other. Its main con-
struction is of Vickers’ world-
famous steels—frames, axles and
springs. The engine, gears, etc.,
are also made from the same fine
Sheffield steel.
The electrical equipment is by one
of Vickers subsidiary companies,
while the accessories and tyres are
also British.
Thus in choosing the Wolseley
you know you are securing
a car in which you can repose
the utmost confidence—t h e
car of wonderful endurance
that has been aptly termed
“England’s Brilliant Masterpiece.”

CpRACTICALLY every discriminating woman would prefer to wear Pure
Silk Hose, but in the past not every woman has been able to afford its
cost. To-day, this latter condition has ceased to exist, for in producing
Sylk-Arto Hose, Bond’s Chemists have once and for all bridged the £ap
between the natural feminine desire for Pure Silk Hose and the limited
purchasing power of the average feminine purse.
Yet even this does not tell the full story
of the service that Bond’s Chemists have
rendered to the feminine community, for
not only does SYLK-ARTO make available
the benefts of Pure Silk Hose at a cost
over the counter that not long since would
have been considered impossibly low; but
its Capacity for Wear is such that
SYLK-ARTO actually represents MUCH
Greater Value than its price would
seem to indicate.
SYLK-ARTO derives its truly remarkable
qualities and attractions from the special
thread used in its manufacture. c Z3he dis-
tinctive characteristic of this Thread, is
that it is a PURE SILK Thread, which,
at the same time, possesses the lustrous
sheen which is the most attractive feature
of the highest-grade artificial silk. It
is also capable of surviving a “breaking-
strain” test that would spell disaster to
ordinary Silk or Artificial Silk Thread.
You will certainly decide that wearing Silk Hose every day is a luxury 3

Restlessness.
Dear heart, if life were one long summer’s
day,
If life were naught but dreams and poesy,
Then love in chains were well content to stay,
The while Ambition drowned in ecstasy.
But summer dies, the rose’s bloom is shed;
And love grows weary of the arms that
cling—
Weary of kissing, though warm lips be red,
Craving some bolder, nexv adventuring.
Let me but walk alone a little space
To strive and conquer in the world of men,
To meet the great life-chances face to face —
Then, wearied, come into your arms again.
QUEENSLAND.

Destined Ways.
We boast of roads that we shape and tread;
But, whether we like it or no,
We take the roads that were made for us
Long ages and ages ago.
We are no more than the silver hordes
That, called by the tide, move forth
From sheltered waters and follow the coast
North ever and ever north.
The winds may howl and the seas may rage
And fishermen take their toll,
Yet ever and ever by reef and dune,
Shoal follows the track of shoal.
No hand may stay them but that strange hand
That marked their path through the sea
Ere man knew wisdom and laughed to scorn
The puzzle of Destiny.
The strong man’s will is a mighty power
That battles to good through ill;
When age creeps on and the flesh grows
weak,
Where then is the strong man’s will?
We are no more than the wild black swans
That fly when the world's at rest —
A trailing flock ’neath a crescent moon—
West ever and ever west.
No hand may stay them but that strange
hand
That marked their course in the air,
Ere man, at the birth of time, was born
To sorrow and toil and care.
We boast of roads that our own selves build ;
But whether xve like it or no,
We take the x-oads that were built for us
Long ages and ages ago.

The Foam-kiss.
The white wings dip to the wet sand-floor,
Full-toned in the voice of the sea;
But I dare not walk by the weed-strewn
shore
Lest the deep should cry to me.
I dare not stay where the spent waves kiss
And spread in a smother of foam;
For the wind-brought white might leave its
kiss
And call me home and home.
The frail balls dance when the breezes blow,
Pearl-pale in a quivering throng.
Where the currents curl and the sea-grapes
grow
I shall hear a ceaseless song:
“Oh, little wild heart of the sea, come home!
Come home to the wind and the tide!
Hear how the grey gulls call from the foam ,
And high green crests they ride!
“Oh, little wild heart, you’ve been long away.
Come back with your straight black hair
And your sunburnt cheeks that are salt with
spray
And your sea-drowned eyes a-stare!”
Oh, turn my face to the farthest lijlL
High up where the great clouds pass,
Where the noons are gold and the grey dusks
spill
Their pools of pearl on the grass !
I would have done with the crusted keel,
The wrack and the spume and reek;
Yet where’er I go I shall always feel
The kiss of foam on my cheek.
And never shall I slip past the reach
Of the wave and the swift-turned wing ;
I shall hear the moan of some storm-lashed
beach
And a ghost-voice whispering:
“Oh, little wild heart, come home to the sea!
The pale hands curl from the foam
And the torn kelp kisses the bare brown
knee—
Little wild heart, come home, come home!
VICTORIA.

The New Things.
Black trees against the yellow skies
And a ghost of a star;
The world is filled with sweet surprise
That such things are!
A moon under a black cloud
Anri a threat of thunder;
The winds pause, hushed and cowed,
Full of wonder.
Fresh as a rose that opened at night
To the murmur of dew
Is the moment winged for a sudden flight,
Flashing and new.
When I shall weary to look on your eyes
And the wonder they hold,
Let the day go with its last surprise—
I shall be old.

ESSEX
SIX
The
Worlds
New
Masterpiece
What people want to know concerning the latest HUDSON Product.
The LAYMAN.
The new Essex Six, a liigh-efficieney
light-weight (approx. 1 ton) machine, which
supersedes the Essex Four, surpasses all
expectations as an attractive car for Aus-
tralian owners. Its new motor, which is
tremendously powerful, is exceptionally
economical in the use of fuel—that it will
do twenty-four miles per gallon is a very
conservative statement. The engine, whilst
it retains many of the features which did so
much to establish the Avonderful reputation
of the Essex Four in the past, has been de-
signed more on the principles of its big
brother, the Hudson Super Six. This “Six”
continues the qualities of efficiency and relia-
bility that are known to 135,000 oAvners of
Essex “Fours,” Avhilst, through the improve-
ments to its motor, it gives that smoothness
of performance formerly only associated
Avith largest and most costly cars.
The car provides comfortable accommoda-
tion for fixe passengers. The seats are wide,
deep and restful, and leg-room in both front
and rear compartments is ample. The springs
are now longer, and minimise surface
inequalities to such an extent that riding at
high speeds on rough roads is possible with-
out any appreciable loss of comfort. The
special manner in which the chassis is de-
signed gives an exceptionally loav centre of
gravity, and makes the new Essex possibly
the safest car on the road to-day. As oilers
are fitted, the car can be completely lubri-
cated with an oil-can, in a very few minutes,
and the filling of messy grease-cups and pres-
sure grease-guns is dispensed with. Accessi-
bility is an outstanding feature of the car.
Cord tyres, 31in. x 3fin., are supplied, the
spare at the rear. The petrol tank, Avhich
is also at the back of the car, holds 8 gallons,
and the filler is very accessible, being situ-
ated on the right side of the tank.
Equipment includes spare rim, tyre and tube and
full kit of tools, radiator shutters, Boyce moto-
meter, speedometer, thief-proof lock, cowl ventilator
and numerous other advantages that will irresis-
tibly appeal to the purchaser, as well as the car’s
nimble ease of operation.
Summed up, the Essex Six is poAverful and fast,
light and economical, simple to maintain and
delightfully easy to handle.
The ENTHUSIAST.
The 6-cylinder Essex has a bore and stroke
of 2£in. x 4in., and is designed on the most
modern lines. Its R.A.C. rated horse-power
is 16.5, but at 3300 revolutions per minute
it will develop over 50 brake-horsepower;
Hudson patented scientific balancing makes
this possible.
The tremendous reserve of power and the
high revolutions make speeds in the vicinity
of 60 miles per hour attainable, and the stan-
dard gear ratio of 5.6 to 1 gives top-gear
efficiency and swift pick-up in traffic to a
degree that will satisfy the most exacting
champion of flexibility.
The clutch is the well-known Hudson cork-
insert multiple disc-in-oil type, and the
gearset has three forward speeds and reverse.
The long semi-elliptic springs and. the low
centre of gravity and consequent freedom
from side sway, combine in enabling the car
to cling to the roadway, so that the superior
driver can safely gratify his tastes for high
speeds and fast cornering, even on rough sur-
faces. The car steers with exceptional ease,
in fact, almost like a bicycle.
The brakes are particularly efficient, act-
ing on the 14-Jin. drums on rear wheels. The
entire electrical system is American Bosch.
The wheels are wood, or wire at extra cost,
and the wheel-base is 110 J inches. A
feature of the car is its lowness, the top of
the hood being only sft. 10Jin. above the
ground, and the frame members are only
19 inches above the ground, and this lowness
greatly enhances the car’s appearance; at
the same time the road clearance is all that
could be desired.
In designing this car the makers have
regarded carefully the present-day condi-
tions, when so many owners are enthusiasts
who attend to their own cars, consequently
accessibility and convenience have been
attained in the mechanical parts to a very
marked degree.
The ENGINEER.
Most certainly the trained mind will recog-
nise to the greatest extent the remarkable
excellence of the ESSEX SIX. Engineers
will appreciate the high mechanical prin-
ciples nsed throughout the chassis. They
will perceive the marvellous manner in which
the design lends itself to successful quantity
production; how parts have been turned out
by .automatic machines that ordinarily would
have required hand work entailing greater
expense and less accuracy. There is no
wasted time or labor on the ESSEX SlX—
the result of recent complete reorganisation
of the HUDSON Factory, which made it the
world’s most modern and advanced automo-
bile works.
The engine is L-liead type, piston displace-
ment 130 cubic inches. Compression is
moderate. Suspension at 4 points. Pistons
are split-skirt type of lynite, 3-l/16in. in
length, with three rings above wrist-pins.
Connecting rods are I-beam drop-forgings.
Crankshaft is the HUDSON patent counter-
balance design, 2-Jin. diameter. Three main
bearings, IJin., If in. and If in. in length.
Combustion chambers are carried! in the
detachable cylinder head, and are of tapered
section, with their highest point above the
valve chamber.
The camshaft is driven by Morse adjust-
able silent chain 1 Jin. in width. Valves
have roller tappets, and are interchangeable.
The roller guides and pins are manufactured
to fine limits, being ground all over. The
flywheel is a plain steel disc fin. thick, with
starting-gear teeth cut directly into it.
Lubrication is circulating splash system. Pump
designed to deliver correct quantity of oil in rela-
tion to engine speed.
Carburetter is of special HUDSON design, very
accessible. Cooling by tliermo-syplion. Fan is
pressed steel with four blades. Gear case is
aluminium. Hotchkiss drive. Tubular propeller
shaft with two Spicer universal joints. Semi-
floating rear axle mounted on Timken bearings
throughout, fully adjustable.
Steering is by worm and full worm wheel, is fully
adjustable and very accessible. Springs semi-
elliptic—front 36in. long, rear 55in. long. The
rear springs are set in towards the front, and are
outside the frame members, which arc 28in. apart
and parallel. Frame has live cross members.
Body is mounted outside the frame on six brackets,
which is one of the factors which contribute to the
lowness of the car.

PAYING OFF UNCLE SAM.
It has been mentioned in an informal way
that the United States might be willing to
settle some outstanding war accounts by
taking territory instead of cash. The
matter is still quite unofficial at time of
writing, but the terms mentioned are such
that the willingness will probably be taken
for granted. France possesses eight islands
and some islets in the West Indies, small
but prosperous and a relic of vanished glory
in those parts. It also owes the United
States some £500,000,000 of money, for the
U.S. fought with dollars for a full year be-
fore it began to fight with soldiers. It has
had no luck in collecting, and it has no
visible idea of going to war to collect; but
it is allegedly prepared to take the islands
and call the account square. And if Britain
is impressed by this precedent and will trans-
fer Jamaica, its most imposing possession in
the Indies, it is said that Uncle is prepared
to pay the debt that John Bull has also
so far failed to collect from France, which
presumably means that he will write that
amount (some £600,000,000) off the debt
which Britain owes to Uncle. Whether it
will prove that the proposed cession will
include the scattered Bahamas is uncertain,
but this is probable. There are some hun-
dreds of thousands of Bahamas, and they
amount, all told, to one-sixth the area of
Tasmania; but in the way of blockade-
running, everyday smuggling and bootlegging
on the high seas they are blamed for more
than their size would indicate. Should it
be possible for these deals to come off, every
European Power would be removed from
that end of the U.S. coast, and the little islets
further south might fall in later, when an-
other page was turned in the chapter of
accidents.
The price suggested for what are, after
all, some very minute scraps of territory
may seem large. No one doubts that Britain
intends to pay its debt to its rather exacting
American creditor in full; but Britain has
acquired, for the first time, a Government
with projects of land nationalisation, levies
on capital and other proceedings which are
apt to interfere with the due payment of
debts. Very few war debts, the U.S. may
also remember, whether they are called in-
demnities or by any other name, ever are
paid in full —it might be said that they never
are, unless the creditor takes possession of
the debtor’s estate as security. Something
goes wrong so regularly, and the date of
Judgment l>ay is so uncertain, that the final
instalment, due 62 years ahead, may be re-
garded as hardly worth counting on. An imme-
diate archipelago might, then, seem to Uncle
Sam to be worth more than a very remote
instalment. Suppose, further, that two-
thirds or more of the British debt was paid
in islands, the result would be that Britain
would be on its feet sooner; and if it still
adhered to its Freetrade policy, then Uncle
would proceed to get his sacrificed money
back by the sale of many more Ford cars
and such-like than he could hope to sell to
a deeply-embarrassed customer. In fact, the
financial relief which would accrue to the
Old Man in London might- prevent him turn-
ing Protectionist; and his turning would be
bad for the trade in Ford cars. Apart from
these considerations, a large section in the
United States is passionately desirous of
seeing every European flag removed from
the two American continents and their
vicinity. Then the U.S.A. would be supreme
arbiter from end to end, and the chance of
European Powers fighting out their quarrels
on its doorstep would be eliminated, save
for that casual page in the chapter of acci-
dents which no one can eliminate. Especi-
ally it dislikes European flags near the
approaches to the Panama Canal, and it has
a rooted objection to Crown colonies, which
are apt to connote European garrisons. It
is just conceivable that a self-governing
Dominion, through the peaceful penetration
of United States citizens, trusts, dollars
and baked beans, might decide to change its
habits, and be permitted to do so. But the
Crown colony, assuming the Crown to be
haughty and unapproachable, is different.
* * 4 *
The famous Monkoe doctrine merely set
forth that more European rulers must not
come to America as rulers over new Euro-
pean provinces. It did not say that those
already on the spot must go; but, then, the
United States was a very small and weak
proposition in Monroe’s time, which was
1817-25, and its army had backslidden
and hadn't been trained in the latest devices
of war. Nor was its navy like that of to-
day, which boasts 33 super-ships, of
1,117,000 tons, and with 340 battle guns,
against Britain’s 32 ships, 808.000 tons, and
a mere 284 guns. Further, its biggest gun
didn’t outrange the Britisher's biggest by
21 miles, as it does at present. In fact, the
United States of Monroe’s day wasn’t at all
like the existing one—a Republic which in-
vented disarmament and a League of
'Nations, yet contrived to avoid one and keep
out of the other. Still, the President of
1817-25 certainly meant, even with his
small resources, to give Europe notice to
leave, and it has been leaving, as occasion
served, ever since. Russia and Spain made
two conspicuous departures. and even
Britain, which once owneSf-fee West down
to the Spanish border in California, isn’t
the American territorial magnate it imagined
itself in earlier days. A gallant effort at
advanced Monroeism happened when it was
proposed that Canada and Newfoundland
might be ceded bodily to Uncle, to make up
for the depredations (in 1862-63-64) of three
small Confederate cruisers which the British
Government should have detained but
didn't, missing the 'bus by 24 hours.
* -* * *
Any idea of a cession is probably based,
apart from the massive character of the
U.S. armaments and the luck Uncle has had
in all previous disputes, on the supposedly
yielding and benevolent character of Liberal-
Labor politicians. Egypt, after being rehabi-
litated, has been abandoned, and has promptly
set up a strenuously anti-Ifritish Govern-
ment. Ireland has been made practically
free of the Empire, which retains, however,
the obligation to defend it. This was such
an obvious concession to force that a
Republic with 33 first-class warships and
340 battle guns, some of them carrying
34,500 yards, may be excused for regarding
it as a sign of weakness. The new Indian
Parliament is demanding something very
like a separate India, and the Governor of
an autonomous isle of 28,717 acres, situated
off the English coast and named after a good
milch cow. has resigned because the islanders
consistently refuse to, offer a trifle towards
the bill for the war. An empire of such
experiences, it may be argued, ought not to
mind the sacrifice of a fragmentary archi-
pelago. It would lose a fair number of
niggers, but the United States would gain
them, and somebody (probably an enemy)
once said that the U.S. deserves all the
niggers that come its way. There would
be no great loss of trade, for, thanks to
John Bull’s Freetrade policy, his uncle
has practically all the trade already.
THE KIND-HEARTED LAWYER-
POLITICIAN.
The kind-hearted lawyers sit in their musty
chambers, devouring statistical tables and
blue-books, and accumulating masses of ill-
digested information about calories, kilo-
calories, man-units, higher co-efficients
and the Lord knows what else. Then one
glad day the Big Idea comes to them, and
they propagate it with an almost religious
devotion, having the tenacity of their caste,
its talent for special pleading and its inability
to see more than one side of a case. Thus
a Beeby goes into N. S. Wales politics,
arrives in the Ministry, becomes-a Judge of
the Arbitration Court and president of the
Board of Trade. Desirous of making every-
one happy by short cuts, he knocks four
hours off the working week. The theory
is that struggling N. S. Wales industries
can produce as much in 44 hours as long-
established foreign competitors m 54 hours
or even 60, statutory holidays (14 per
annum in N. S. Wales, as against four
or five in the foreign countries) being
left out of the argument. It is a beautiful
theory, no doubt, but in the process of test-
ing it thousands of workmen lost their Jons,
and industries have been in an unsettled
condition ever since. Thus, also, a I idding-
ton reaches the fringe of politics and is
made chairman of a Basic Wage Commis-
sion, this being one of Hughes’s vote-catch-
ing devices at the 1919 election. The 1 id-
dington Commission reports that the cost ot
maintaining a family of five (man, wife and
three children under 14 years) “according
to reasonable standards of comfort” is 15
16s. a week. Straightway the unions demand
this wage for every male employee in Aus-
tralia ; they point out truly that in the N. S.
Wales basic-wage law, introduced by a Gov-
ernment in which the benevolent. Beeby was
a shining light, no distinction is made be-
tween married and single men. But there
are a million male employees in. the. Com-
monwealth, and it would take £301,600,000
in the first year (and, of course, a lot more
later to cover the certain increase in prices)
to pay them each £5 16s. a week. And tne
total production in 1919-20, an exceptionally
good year, was worth only £348,183,000, of
which amount £149,824,000 was exported in
exchange for foreign goods, and to pay the
interest on the foreign debt. The total pro-
duction for the 10 years prior to the Pin-
dington report averaged £246,319,000 per
annum. Therefore the demand of the unions,
as regards that miraculous first year, was for
55 millions more than the average annual
output of wealth (S3|- millions more than
was produced in the last pre-war year),
leaving nothing for farmers, pastoralists,
manufacturers or employers in general, no-
thing for female employees, contractors or
professional men not in receipt of salaries,
nothing for maintenance of governing insti-
tutions or interest on the public debt.
* * * *
But the good Piddington protests that
he has been misunderstood. He never sug-
gested that every male employee should get
£5 16s. a week; that was to be the wage only
of the married worker with three children.
Those with more children would receive more
money ; those with fewer children less money ;
those without children less still. Mr. Pid-
dington proposes that £4 a week should be
given to the bachelor and the childless Bene-
dick, £4 12s. to the man with one child,
£5 4s. to the father of two children, and
so on. there being an addition of 12s. a week
for each child. Thus an industrious fellow
on the £4 mark, and no prospect of a rise,
might find himself toiling alongside a 50
p.c. inferior workman in receipt of £8 4s.
or more. Were that method of remuneration
in force—if one can imagine it operating—
there would be a vast migration of capable
and ambitious young operatives to foreign
parts where men are paid according to their
ability as workers, not tlieir success as breed-
ers ; and the country would suffer accord-
ingly. Work would decline in quality and
wealth in quantity; there would be wide-
spread bankruptcy and unemployment; if the
process of degeneracy wasn’t arrested in
time, by restoration of the incentive to excel,
Australia would become a G 3 nation rotten-
ripe for conquest. It is proposed to get the
child-endowment money by taxing employers
at the rate of £27 18s. per annum for
every man on the pay-roll. Nothing is said
about the enormous expense and worry in-
volved in preparing returns relative to a
million employees, many of whom never stay
long in one job. in calculating how much
is due to the Treasury, in making about
20,000.000 payments in the course of a year
to nearly 400,000 beneficiaries, and the rest.
Mr. Piddington is rather weak on finance.
He asserts that his scheme could be applied
to 40,000 Commonwealth employees (there
were 41.620 at the latest enumeration) for
an additional cost in the first year of
£1,424,000, every penny of which, of course,
would have to be found by the taxpayer,
whose burden is already as great as he can'
bear. But for every man in the Common-
wealth service five or six are employed by
the State Governments. There are 100,090'
in the six Railway Departments alone. To
extend the scheme to these men would take
another three or four millions per annum, and
necessitate thumping increases in fares that'
are high enough, and in freights that in many
instances are too high.
Kind-hearted political lawyers have had
a lot to do with the making of revolutions.
The time comes, however, when they recoil in
horror from the crowd whose hopes they have
excited; then they are denounced as re-
actionaries and executed with swiftness and
enthusiasm. That was the fate of many of
the kind-hearted political lawyers in the
French National Assembly, notably Bar-
ba roux, Brissot, Buzot, Danton, Des-
moulins and Vergniaud.
THE IRREGULAR LINE.
When Persia and the Greek States met in
the last test at Platea, Amompharetus, the
leader of a Spartan battalion, nearly de-
stroyed the Greek chances of victory by
refusing to fall back into line with the main
army. On the ground that it was disgrace
to Sparta to retreat before any foe, Amom-
pharetus was determined to hold his ground,
and was actually left by the army, isolated
and beyond reach of aid, in the middle of
the plain, until by some caprice which his-
tory does not explain he suddenly changed
his mind and went after his retreating
countrymen. The action of Amompharetus,
though it came near to handing over Europe
to the Asiatic, was due to an exaggerated
sentiment of honor. In the affairs of men,
however, there has always been a tendency
for small advanced forces to be lost because
they are out of touch with the great human
force behind them, not because of any in-
herent qualities making for., destruction in
themselves. Where isolated examples of fine
culture met barbaric hordes, they were always
doomed; where an exceptional salient of
thought projected too far out into the terri-
tory of ignorance, its failure was practically
certain ; where a great man saw human pos-
sibilities far beyond the reach of the minds
of other men of his time, he was generally
treated as mad —sometimes killed as danger-
ous. All the social conventions are part of
a system which is almost militauy in its
regulations and forms; and the conventions
in the mass represent a sort of battle line.
It is never very safe to linger in the no-
man’s land in front, much less to go out
exploring in the enemy’s territory. For the
theory of the conventions is that they are
made for general defence against an enemy
of disorder which is too strong for the indi-
vidual to fight alone. The mass of men in
the line may be interested in the convention
breaker, but he has henceforth no settled
place in the ranks of order.
But it is in the march of that great in-
definite thing called world-progress that the
irregularities of the line have counted most.
Take the case of China, about which a
Peking contributor is writing to-day. Beau-
tiful buildings, fine gardens, the intense love
of books and of. thought, a strange but won-
derfully attractive art which touched every
manufacture and gave a charm to all the
ordinary things of life —these existed in China
right back to the dawn of history. Other
lovely things went with them. Every Chinese
story and legend reveals little amenities and
graces of life which denote a people of
delicate habit and gentle thought. The China
of two thousand years ago was, in fact, a
China of over-refinement, a China seeking
always the simplicities of life and passion-
ately devoted to all the forms of quiet beauty.
Though close to the soil and maintaining
always a pride in industry, China marched
too far ahead of the main army of the
wmrld’s progress. From love of peace the
Chinese easily moved to the thought of despis-
ing the soldier. Poems exist, written about
the time of the struggle between Rome ami
Carthage, which show that military affairs
were already held in contempt beside the Yel-
low River at that remote date. The Chinese
salient in the human line was indeed so
large that it looked to these adventurers of
higher thought as if it occupied the whole
world ; and then the Tartars swept over the
land. Those invasions practically destroyed
the salient. Chinese progress ceased; Chinese
culture turned back upon itself and took
bizarre and sometimes unpleasant shapes;
the imitator became more than the artist,
the eccentricity more than the direct and
forceful movement. The fall of Egypt, of
Greece, of Rome and of the Saracen empires
wmre all due to similar cause; but with the
difference that, while China remained mark-
ing time, the others were practically swept
out of existence.

' The world’s chief danger to-day lies in the
same direction. The salients of the world’s
thought are pushed out far beyond the main
line of advance and are in deadly danger of
being cut off. It is true that we are not
in immediate danger of any large aggrega-
tions of savage men over-running our so-
called civilisation. Our dangers are rather
within the boundaries of civilisation itself;
our savage hordes are mostly within the
great cities. While men of great mental
energy have pushed out salients of thought
in every realm of human knowledge, the
great mass of the people have not moved at
all. Study the conditions of late Stone-age
life as revealed by the archaeologist, and it
is plain that the majority of the world's
people are in essentials living the same kind
of life. They do mechanical tasks which are
guided by other minds and which, beyond their
own very narrow portion of the job, they do
not understand at all. In their own time
and freed from the restraints of master
minds they possess little, if anything, worth
while which the Stone-age people missed. All
that the age of iron means to them person-
ally is a knife of steel to cut up their food
instead of a knife of stone. They may travel
by mechanical means over great portions of
the earth, and sec and feel less than the
Stone-age man saw and felt in a three days’
journey on foot. They may spell out the
daily newspaper, and feed their minds less
than the Stone-age man fed his from a talk
with a traveller from a distant tribe. It is
here that the real danger lies. The world
may not be called to wait while the Sou-
danese native and the Nigerian black come
up in the race, but it may be called to wait
while John Smith andp Ivan Ivanovitch
lift themselves beyond their primal ideas and
primitive culture. Brute force unbacked
by reason has to be reckoned with unless a
means can be found of keeping force always
at the command of intellect. The present
attempts to lift the world by general pri-
mary education promise well, but they have
not yet given much in the way of results:
nor have the people who hold the power of
the world’s wealth done much to fortify the
position of learning. Compare the earnings
of the world’s greatest teachers with those
of the world’s most successful traders, and
it at once becomes evident that the great
money interests are not definitely on the side
of intellectual progress. Everywhere the
salients are in extreme danger.
In the revolutionary changes which are
taking place the question forces, itself
strongly upon us whether the world is to go
back from its advanced positions and
straighten the line or attempt to bring the
rank and file up to the farthest points
attained. To do the latter something more
than a mechanically perfect system is re-
quired. It is the world’s goodwill towards
learning that is most needed. The world
must honor its foremost minds in a w r ay that
makes the emulation of their achievements
the first of human aims. Knowledge is not
a sacred thing in the eyes of the multitude.
The man of science, the philosopher, the
inventor, the poet, the artist and the scholar
are all made jests of common vaudeville.
Only the dull and commonplace are not re-
garded as ridiculous. Let the kings of mind
be kings indeed and the whole aspect of
world affairs changes. A new aristocracy of
acknowledged intellect is the natural pro-
gression to meet modern requirements.
CHINA’S DRIFT TO DISASTER.
Letters are coming into the various Lega-
tions in Peking telling of the increasing hos-
tility toward foreigners, and warning that,
unless some steps are taken to offset this,
the missionaries, engineers and trade emis-
saries will have to come into the treaty
ports or risk being slain any day. It is not
only the activity of the bandits and the rob-
bers that causes apprehension; there is a


general feeling among the people that the
foreigners are responsible for the present
state of affairs in China, which is admittedly
worse than at any previous time in the his-
tory of the republic. It is the belief of
■many Europeans competent to form judg-
ments that conditions will continue on their
downward trend until there will occur in
some part; of China such ad outrage as will
make impossible the employment of peaceful
measures and compel a punitive expedition.
In my travels about China I meet people of all
nationalities who express themselves on this
subject, and many of these also have written
to their Ministers. Some of them suggest
remedies, not all the same, but for the most
part that concerted action of some kind is
necessary. The decision of the American
Government to send additional gunboats and
a squadron of five airplanes to reinforce
the Asiatic fleet is regarded not as a step
towards a remedy, but merely as a measure
of defence.
Of course, all Chinese are not hostile to
the foreigners ; many rather, like them. Yet,
as in the case of the Boxer rising, the mul-
titude may be easily inflamed against them.
This is, in fact, a favorite trick of the
Chinese politician, who, finding himself get-
ting into hot water, turns attention from
himself and directs the hostility against
someone else. It was the corrupt following
of the Empress Dowager who turned the
mind of the people from Peking and towards
the foreigner, and thus brought about the
Boxer rising—of which, by the way, the
Legations had full warning. They have
warnings again to-day ; but they simply sigh,
think of the unfinished war in Europe, and
say: “What can we do? We are too busy
with the labor unrest at home and with
the manoeuvring in Europe to pay any atten-
tion to the wails from China.”
Just as the Boxer rising was due to the
foment for the overthrow of the Manchu
dynasty, so the condition of affairs in China
to-day is the prelude to the collapse Of the
Republic. It cannot last. It never has
been a real republic. There is no popular
support behind it. It is maintained only
by arms, and where these arms do not pene-
trate the voice of Peking is ignored. It is
a corrupt voice at best. To keep the minds
of the people off the real causes of the pre-
sent situation their eyes are being turned in
another direction.
Most of the money that now comes to
Peking spells corruption at the source. The
commanders of the swollen armies in the
provinces are told they must collect the
money for their support locally. In many
cases what money is sent from Peking is
pocketed by the commanders and their
friends, and the heads of the local garrisons
are told to shift for themselves. In numer-
ous provinces the taxes have been collected
three years in advance ; in others the farmers
have been forced to plant poppy because of
the heavy tax collected in the form of a fine.
And in addition there are collected various
sorts of local levies from the merchants and
householders, through the guilds and the
Chambers of Commerce. The Legations have
ample evidence of this ; even the mission pro-
perties have been assessed, in direct viola-
tion of the treaties.
Xow that matters have got to the breaking-
point, and the people, ever living on the brink
of starvation, are about to be pushed over,
the blame is being laid at the door of the
foreigner. When the small shopkeeper or
the house-owner protests against the fre-
quency of the levies, the agent of the cor-
ruptionist sent out to rob the people makes
this reply or a variation of it: “It is the
foreign devil who forces us to this. He
takes all our revenue from the Customs ; he
takes what he wants of our salt revenues,
and he leaves us nothing for our domestic
uses.” Such subtle arguments are under-
mining, slowly but steadily, all respect for
foreigners.
Banditry in China, which is worse than
it ever was, is a result not so much of mili-
tarism as of greed. The large armies were
not built up through military necessities.
Armies were recruited, many of them largely
on paper, and fictitious pay-rolls were
sent to Peking, the money being pocketed by
the unscrupulous leaders. From time to
time, as exigencies required, men were re-
cruited, or (more often) impressed for ser-
vice, in order that the padded pay-roll might
be justified. Then, the exigency having
passed, as suddenly these armies were dis-
missed, in companies and in whole regiments.
Sometimes the soldiers deserted in bodies
because they had not been paid. They were
far from home and family. The only re-
course was to remain together and turn to
banditry. Now, in several provinces, as
many as 3000 are gathered under one leader-
ship, with numerous bands of 500 to 1000,
raiding the country, taking a toll of lives —
the lives of foreigners included—and utterly
beyond control of Peking or the local autho-
rities. And because of the pressure put
upon the Government by the foreign Powers
when a national is killed, captured, outraged
or robbed, the people have been compelled
through contributions and enforced collec-
tions to pay heavy tribute. Yet this money
is not paid to the Government concerned.
Chiefly it is “graft.” Although heavy dam-
ages were demanded for the release of the
Lincheng captives, and much money was
collected by the Shantung authorities from
the people, not one cent has been paid to
the victims or their families. The people
do not know this; they know only that they
have paid. And so when they hear of in-
creased pressure by the foreign Powers, or
of further retention of funds for foreign
compensation, they more and more turn
against foreigners. As for the bandits, they
know no foreign Government can take direct
action, and so they find foreigners the best
weapons to hold over Peking. Worst of all,
the practice is progressive.
In its present manifestation the republic
in China is as great a failure as the Manchu
dynasty in its last days, and that is due
solely to the riot of corruption. The republic
is heading for disaster. Armed foreign inter-
vention is unthinkable. Subjugation of
China by military force is an impossibility.
Observers who have been in China for many
years, but who have no selfish motives, and
are opposed to further seizures of land or
additional burdens upon an already robbed
people, believe the inevitable foreign inter-
vention must take the form of an inter-
national regency. How concord of the
Powers can be obtained in the face of the
fire smouldering in Europe not one of these
obsexwers is able to venture a guess. It is
suggested that one nation might do it alone,
acting, it may be, in defiance of, but in the
interest of, all other nations. There is only
one nation that might do it. Yet it has not
the incentive, because it is so insular. The
United States is idealistic, but is even more
isolated than China. The Administration
that would suggest such a step for the benefit
of China would go down to defeat in a whirl-
wind of ballots. In all this discussion Japan
is not mentioned. She has a policy of watch-
ful waiting.
Yet a benevolent regency would not be re-
pelled, but would be welcomed by China. It
would, however, have to be a regency of iron
courage and steel resolution. It would have
to begin with a clean sweep in Peking, and
then, backed by a strong army of Chinese,
set out to bring, one by one, the provinces
and their leaders back to the fold, insisting
only upon honest and conscientious govern-
ment, a government set up at the end of an
aven .e lined with the heads of corrupt
officials. It would be a long avenue
in most provinces, but an impressive
warning to the new officials marching up it
to assume charge. The avenue of Peking
would have to begin at the nearest seashore,
at Taku, where the armed foreigners landed
in 1900 and on a previous occasion. Yet
it is all a long way off. Many more foreign-
ers will first be killed,
Peking.
CHARLES DAILEY.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Shop Opens for Business.
The new British Prime Minister is rather
lofty in his attitude when he points out that
not even the first signs of the cataclysm
which was to accompany the Labor policy
have shown themselves yet, and in congratu-
lating the level-headed people who refused to
be scared. Really there has been little time;
also there has been little Labor policy and
plenty of assurance that there will be little;
and even an ordinary person isn’t alarmed
at the sight of a fierce and bounding savage
if reliably assured that he is only a Sunday-
school teacher dressed and painted to look
the part. After March 31 (John Bull be-
gins his financial year on All Pools’ Day)
it will be necessary to make a new start with
a complete policy; but no one expects any-
thing hugely picturesque even then. It is
hard to see how there can be. Yet interest-
ing events are looked for. In the policy out-
line which the new Prime Minister supplied
to Parliament, he stated, with large philan-
thropy, that the Government aimed to “build
£5OO houses to be let at a rental of 9s. per
week, including rates.” The local rates
(payable by the occupier) in the 28
boroughs which, added to the city itself,
make up Greater London, range from 10s. 2d.
in the £ to 235. in the £. The smaller
figure would leave only about 4s. lid. per
week for rent, and the larger figure would
leave nothing at all. Further, wdiile only 9s.
per week gross is to be collected, on a 5 per
cent, basis the £9OO house would cost more
like 14s. per week in interest, repairs, depre-
ciation, insurance, management, vanishing
tenants and periodical lack of tenants. As
the policy is a large one, running to 100,000
houses the first year and 200,000 per year
afterwards, the anticipated drain on the
Treasury is tremendous. The greatest efforts
at official house-building in Britain so far
were 86,700 houses in 1921 and 88,900 in
1922, and this moderate effort cost many
fortunes. But Lloyd George had a gener-
ous disregard for cost, and apparently the
present incumbent is similarly constructed.
A less definite item of the policy is to pro-
vide employment (apart from house-building
out of loans, for men are not all house-
builders) by sticking to the methods under
which all the horrors of unemployment came
about. The levy on capital and the nation-
alisation of land and industries would have
been at least pig-headed attempts to deal
with the evil, but they have been postponed
to the year a.d. 19??. The Government’s one
vigorous step, so far, has been to restore the
right to levy unlimited local taxation for
alms-giving purposes to the Poplar Board
of Guardians, a Bolshevik body which put
up the “unemployed” dole to the level, or
above the level, of the average local wage,
wherefore the lot of the man who hadn’t the
luck to be out of work became hard, and his
rates were more than double his rent.
Macdonald’s predecessor had found a way to
limit these gyrations, but the limit is now
annulled. Items lower on the programme in-
clude some price-fixing and the doing of some-
thing to the “profiteer”; also it urges exten-
sion of the apprenticeship system. It seems a
jest—all the Prime Minister’s eulogists have
dwelt so much on his open-handedness to
homeless dogs and cats that no one likes to
employ the term “heartless” in his case. The
British shipbuilders and engineers, especi-
ally those of the Clyde (to quote only one
case), are known as the best in the world.
Yet their lives are now a long, hard struggle
to get away to some Protectionist country.
A recent London Daily Mail jeremiad put
it:—
Unemployment is appallingly extensive here, while
it is non-existent in the United States —whither some
of our best men have gone—and in Germany
While our trade languishes, machines and tools
are imported at prices below those which are quoted
by British firms.
Many of the best men are gone. And among
those who remain the proportion out of work
by recent figures was 222 per thousand. And
the proposed remedy is to make more
engineers! The new Government, with six
peers at one end and Jack Jones’s wild
communists at the other, and Ramsay
Macdonald balanced delicately on a plati-
tude in the middle, looks a monstrous futility.

Only 160 Days without a Wash.
The Federal Treasurer set no standard of
dazzling ambition when he suggested that
Australia should decide to keep its debt,
State and Federal, at the existing level,
which is £l6O per head, and swear off en-
largement. Every time the population is
increased to the net extent of a penniless
infant or impecunious “pommy,” another
£l6O is to be borrowed, but no more. Owing
that amount, and struggling periodically
round to the squalid pawnshop to see if
Isaac Tiieeeball will renew “der dicket.”
is thus to be the normal condition of this
bright young land. A nation with no higher
aims than that is almost better dead. Its
first object in life should be to get the
liability down to £6O per head, and its next
to get rid of the £6O; and a small terrace
of reasons can be adduced in support of this
view:—
If Australia, by any possibility, decided to act
like the converted woman of sin, who said that,
though she didn’t expect to be improved by con-
version, she wouldn’t get any worse than she was n
her unregenerate days, it still couldn’t stop there.
If the next war found the debt, as Eaiile Pao:;
suggests, still at £l6O per inhabitant, the said
disturbance would probably put the figure up to
£250, and the extra £9O would cost 10 or 12
per cent, because of the rotten position that the
nation started from. Then the next Treasurer would
propose reforming some more, and putting in the peg
at £250.
A debt of £l6O per head, face value, may be any
amount in reality. In one recent year, for instance,
the debt on the Federal railways was nominally
about £10,000,000, that being the cost price of a
litter of -perishable assets. It was really more like
£20,000,000, the difference being the annual loss
capitalised.
Then £l6O per head is an absurd amount to owe
for assets (even if there were anything like enough
assets) that will almost certainly go out of date.
Wireless telegraphy and telephony are obvious facts,
motors are already largely used in place of rail-
ways, and the “cargo plane” is already carrying
loads in Europe.
Further, some of the States (Westralia especially)
are far beyond the £l6O mark already, and as their
State debts are growing much faster than the Federal
Treasurer reduces their Federal debts, that gentle-
man is merely talking to the winds unless he has
a plan on hand.
Plans that will meet the case are difficult to
arrive at, but not impossible. New States,
when any are formed, might have elaborate
loan restrictions put in their Constitutions.
Old States which are more or less on the
rocks and come round for aid should get it —
on condition that they put their finances
under Federal control until their debts are
materially reduced. In other words, a
benevolent receiver should be put in. The
Commonwealth should refuse absolutely to
lend any more money to States merely to
keep the public-works or land-settlement
boom going, and should concentrate on two
matters. The first is to provide, so far as
possible, for its own liabilities, which tend
to fall due in inconvenient masses at incon-
venient times. The second is to create, by
taxation if necessary, the solid sinking funds
against the State debts which the States so
consistently fail to provide themselves.
Nothing would tend more to establish a
community of interest than for the Federal
tax-gatherer to come around and collect
from the State people, who are equally its
own people, the insurance premium against
their own extravagance. But as a pre-
liminary to any material reform it is neces-
sary to get a new point of view, the point
being that debt, like dirt, is Avliolly objection-
able, even if occasionally unavoidable for a
time, and that to owe only £l6O is no more
creditable, save in a strictly comparative
way, than to have been only 160 days with-
out a wash.

The Child in the Dock.
Recently two boys of 15 were brought be-
fore the Court in Adelaide and confessed to
seven or eight small burglaries. Evidence
was given of their good character ordinarily,
and Dr. Ramsay Smith was put in the box
to give “psychological evidence.” The effect
was to exclude them from “the criminal
type,” and to attribute their misdoings to
a misdirection of youthful energy which had
not an outlet in proper mental employment
and physical recreation. They were ordered
to be under supervision of officers of the
State Children’s Council until they are 18.
The fact which the case stresses is the im-
mense change that has come about in the
attitude of society toward the wrongdoer. We
have just completed a century since one of
the greatest reforms in English criminal law
was carried into effect through the efforts,
primarily, of Sir Samuel Romilly and Sir
James Mackintosh, and with the sympathy
of Sir Robert Peel, who wms Home Secre-
tary at the time. In 1823 five statutes
exempting from capital punishment about
100 felonies v r ere passed through Parlia-
ment —and, it is recorded, “without a dis-
sentient voice.” Other reforms followed
until in 1861 only four crimes in England
remained punishable by death. At the close
of last century, when the administration of
old age pensions in N. S. Wales w r as in the
hands of the then colony, a man aged 82
presented himself as an applicant for a
pension. His case made-a link between the
old view of crime and its punishment and
the now prevailing one. He came to this
country in 1843, in a convict ship, and under
sentence of transportation for having stolen
a watch. On the same ship was a boy 14
years of age, sentenced to seven years’ trans-
portation for having stolen a butcher’s knife
valued at fourpence; also another lad sen-
tenced to the same period for shooting and
appropriating rabbits. The old man did
four years “on the roads,” was then assigned
to a master, obtained his freedom, and lived
an honest life for many years. Then he
lapsed. He stole ten pounds, was found out
and sent to trial. The police have a long
memory, stimulated by carefully-kept records,
but it did not reach back to the beginning
of this old man’s history. lie was found
guilty, sentenced and then released as a
first offender. Compare the cases of the
two lads in Adelaide with those of the two
boys transported along with this old man.
The change in the point of view of crime and
its punishment is accentuated by the psycholo-
gist in the box. In early days religion
and the law, closely associated, found justi-
fication for punishment in the doctrine of
revenge. It was the vengeance of society
visited on the violator of its laws. It was
not till the middle of the 18th century that
any other concept found favor. Then Bec-
carta promulgated a theory that influenced,
if it did not wholly supersede, the ancient
tenet. This theory was that by punishing
the offender society defended itself, having
regard to the common interest. From ven-
geance the change was to defence. It was
not till much later that the idea of reforma-
tion being associated with punishment was
conceived. On the lines of this association
a vast deal of work has been done. In the
United States it has received almost its com-
plete extension from the date of the founda-
tion of the Elmira Institution to the present
day. The psychologist now comes on the
scene to carry us a step further. His appear-
ance in the court at Adelaide is not remark-
able in itself. He is an important officer,
though seldom seen by the public, in the
Children’s Court in N. S. Wales. When a
juvenile offender is brought before that tri-
bunal the magistrate is handed a card. From
it he learns the results of the physiological
and the psychological examination of the
child before him made by a medical expert.
The psychological examination is based on
Binet’s test —a simple form of mental analy-
sis devised by the French expert. The magis-
trate, reading this card, gets an idea of
what the boy’s physical and mental environ-
ment has been—apart from any elements of
heredity; perhaps a drunken father, a men-
tally defective mother. It is helpful for him
to know that the boy is, say, anaemic, ill-nur-
tured. and, though 14 years of age, has, it
may be, only the mental development of a
normal boy of nine years. He is thus set
thinking of the lad not as an object on which
society will visit vengeance, or from which
it will defend itself, but as a bit of humanity
to be analysed, and for which, on the result
of the analysis, an appropriate environment
may, if possible, be found. An American
writer, with 40 years’ experience drawn
from the practice of his profession in court,
declares that by far the larger proportion of
the population of prisons is made up of the
insane, feeble-minded persons, morons, defec-
tives or victims of diseases that seriously
influence conduct. We. as well as they, are
the products of heredity and environment.
The one cannot be changed ; the other can.
“In the past and present.” says this writer,
“the world has sought to adjust heredity to
environment. The problem of the future in
dealing with crime will be to adjust environ-
ment to heredity.”
♦
The Personal Touch for Migration.
Cripfs Clark talks with knowledge:—
The best migration officer we can have in England
is the man who started from scratch as a selector
in our Backblocks. He could tell the tale to pros-
pective migrants of how he had carved a home out
of the bush, how he had seen his tent give place to
a bark hut, and the hut to a neat homestead, sur-
rounded by garden and orchard. He could paint
the picture of pioneering as it should be painted,
not as it is so often depicted in humorous cartoons
and on the stage, where some mythical Dad and
Mum and their family are represented as semi-
idiots whose knockabout act among the cows and
pigs raises laughter in the cities and scorn in the
bush.
There is hard work in the bush, but there is
romance too, and that makes no small appeal to the
British youth, who by heredity is a coloniser, and
yearns for the free life offered by the big open spaces
of Australia. No amount of official literature giving
statistics of our primary products and the vast
areas of bush waiting to be transformed into pros-
perous farms, and handed over a mahogany counter
by a languid clerk who wouldn’t recognise a farm
if he saw one, can stir the imagination of possible
migrants like the personal experiences of the man
who has been there —a man who can explain how,
from scaring crows on an English farm for 2s. 6d.
per week, he rose to be the owner of a prosperous
estate in Australia. To the prospective migrant
he is Success personified. Such a man —and there
are plenty of them here —would imbue thousands of
young Britishers with the ambition to come over
here and do likewise. It is the personal touch that
does the trick; it carries conviction, and only the
man who has had experience of what he is talking
about can apply it. The pity of it is that there
is no one at Australia House, from the heads to
the office-boy, who has any practical knowledge that
would be of use to a British farmer with capital,
or a youngster with nothing but his hands, who
wished to settle on our lands. For influencing
British farmers to guide their steps this way we
must have them talked to by men who have suc-
ceeded as farmers.
An illustration. A friend of mine was, many
years ago, unconsciously the means of adding a
dozen or more likely young men to the population
of N. S. Wales. In our youth my friend and I
were both apprenticed to the sea; but he had left
his ship in Newcastle. Some years after, when
he had settled on the land and married, he noticed
in a paper that his old ship was loading in Sydney.
He travelled down from the North-West to have a
look at her. He made friends with the captain
on his first visit, and frequently dined aboard of her.
He chatted with the officers and apprentices, telling
them his various experiences up country—how he
had worked on a sheep-station until he had saved
enough money to take up a. block of land; how he
had prospered as his land and stock increased.
They r were all mightily interested, and asked many
questions about the prospects and conditions of life
in the bush, which he was pleased to answer. When
he came down to see the skipper off on his return
voyage, he found the old man in a very bad humor.
Asked the reason, the skipper explained that half
of his crew —all young men—had deserted, and the
rest would have followed if he had not hauled off
from the wharf. “It’s all your fault,” he added,
“for spinning those d —d cuffers about life in the
bush. They all knew that you had been an apprentice
on this hooker, and that you have made stacks of
Australia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where the wild grass blows she lies
Strong and brown beneath blue skies.
Golden-lashed, her eyes of fire
Flock with dreams of full desire.
Sometimes I have seen her rise
From her ease-green paradise; -
Slowly with seductive hand
Scattering seeds upon the land.
Languidly she rests again
While the warm sun plumps the grain;
And by surf-mad beach and bay
All her health-pink children play.
Where the Avild grass dies she stands,
Thin and brown with freckled hands,
Lean as hunger, gaunt as pain,
Waiting for the lost, cool rain.
Sometimes I have watched her go
Through the burnt fields to and fro,
Bitter-lipped, grey eyes grief-dry,
Listening for a sick child’s cry!
Just a woman, sullen, lone,
Teeth set, ploughing dust and stone,
Till a grim God. proud as she,
Spills His tears’ fertility.

money out here, and so they didn’t see why they
couldn’t do the same.” No doubt the skipper
summed up the matter correctly, for, although the
crew had made several voyages to Sydney, the men
had never thought of remaining in Australia until my
friend fired their imagination with his personal experi-
ences in search of fortune. He had been just a sailor
like themselves, therefore the same road was open
to them. It was the personal touch, and the moral
of this reminiscence applied to our migration schemes
sticks out like a jib-boom.

The Basic Issue.
The prohibition campaign is at the moment
more active in N. S. Wales than in any
other Australian State, but there is a dead
silence on the only real issue of practical
politics. The whole world knows that drink,
like women, horses and other good things,
has ruined thousands, and that, unless totally
exterminated, it will ruin other thousands.
War, the weather, motoring, aviation, reli-
gion, polar exploration, card-playing, the
old-age habit and ten thousand more fixed
institutions figure in the same category.
What is required of N. S. Wales prohibi-
tionists is that they should put aside their
irrelevant examples of social misfits who have
been slain or impoverished by alcohol, and
point out how alcohol is to be prohibited in
their State if authority is given for the
experiment. A recent cable mentioned that
one General Butler, of Philadelphia, had
“evolved something unusual” :
Policemen are stationed in the precincts of every
so-called “near-beer parlor.” These policemen enter
with customers and see with what the latter are
served. There are 26 of these parlors in one of
the busiest sections of the city, and each has patrol-
men before it.
These steps have had to be taken in one of
the chief cities of a country which has been
throwing all its naval and military resources
on the side of enforcement for several years.
Despite which :
The firm of Wile, Sons and Co., which has been
in business for 50 years, announces that it is re-
turning Scotch whisky valued at 1,000,000 dollars
to Glasgow on account of being unable to compete
with U.S. bootleggers’ prices.
The horrible stuff which is pouring into the
country is indicated by a recent leading
article in the New York Sunday American :
Bootleg whisky, the corruption of officials and
public disregard for law and Constitution have put
triple on an organised gigantically profitable basis.
Hundreds of millions a year that once went to the
Government as a tax on the regulated trade in
alcohol now go into the pockets of criminals. And
in place of the old whisky, which was bad enough,
the people buy from the bootleg king and his hench-
men a whisky that has all the evil effects of the
old whisky with new 7 dangers added. In the old
times a bottle of whisky a day would, in course of
time, destroy a man ; in this day one single bottle
of bootleg whisky may kill half a dJzen in an
hour. And undern , 'ath the fabric of our civilisation
there has been built up a whisky hell, a dominion
of darkness and crime, on such a scale of organisa-
tion as has never before been dreamed of.
What prospect has N. S. Wales —debt-bur-
dened, under-policed and without hope of
naval or military help—of improving on this
state of affairs? And unless there is a de-
monstrable prospect of success, what justi-
fication have N. S. Wales’s prohibitionists
for working to substitute the bootleg busi-
ness, with its attendant evils, for those
liquor reforms which are showing increas-
ingly good results outside the U.S.A., and
in Australia as conspicuously as anywhere?

A cable from London, though iti lacks some-
thing in clearness, says Westralia’s Ministry
has arranged with the British Government
“to settle 6000 British farmers and 60,000
migrants in five years,” the migrants being,
presumably, incipient farmers of one sort
or another. The cablegram adds: “The
State will be guaranteed by the British
Government to the extent of £250 against
loss in advances to settlers” —which sug-
gests that the Ramsay Macdonald combina-
tion has an easily-bitten ear. Westralia
certainly has got a fair amount of extra
land nominally under crop since 1919. But,
curiously enough, the entire Westralian area
said to be in cultivation in 1922 was less
than that of 1916 and 1917, so it seems
like a case of getting migrants and losing
them, and getting more migrants and maybe
losing them. A manufacturing population
sticks, and so does an agricultural population
which works for a local market; but the job
of growing vegetables for remote popula-
tions has too many ups and downs. The
three States which have the smallest pro-
portion of their population engaged in fac-
tories are Tasmania (475 out of each 10,000
inhabitants), Westralia (544) and Queens-
land (553). And, significantly, they are the
three States where the financial situation is
worst. But the cultivation of a manufac-
turing population is an intricate matter,
while anybody with a lot of borrowed money
can put anybody else “on the land.”

Dear Bulletin, —The fact that Randolph
Bedford (B. 27/12/’23) found a disease
called “Kidmanism” battening on his elec-
torate of Warrego casts rather a reflection
on J. 11. Coyne, who sat for many years
for the rabbit-nibbled principality. And the
fact that Coyne was Minister for Lands
during most of the time only makes his crime
the more heinous. Coyne, however, has re-
cently gone up to a seat on the Land Court;
and that fact adds to the interest which
back-country Queenslanders take in the pros-
pect of huge areas of high-class grazing
lands being thrown open for closer settle-
ment in the near future. Labor-in-Parlia-
ment is scratching its head and wondering
what it is going to do about it. Many of
the old pastoral leases will shortly expire—
fall dead in a heap, so to say—and a good
deal of speculation is going on as to what
will happen to the corpse. Labor in land
administration has set its face consistently
in the past against closer settlement in die
western areas (Bedford’s areas). It was
Coyne’s voice that early in the piece called
attention to a danger that certainly looks
genuine enough from a Labor standpoint.
The gist of it is this—that every selector
of grazing lands who becomes possessed of
what is regarded as “a living area” in the
West (that is to say, a grass-patch of from
10,0€0 to 20,000 acres in extent) must of
necessity become an employer of labor to do
his shearing, and his fencing, and his . dam-
sinking ; and the finding has been, almost
without exception, that in a short time, no
matter how good a Labor man he was in
the past, his interests become those of the
employing class, and himself usually a mem-
ber of the P.U. Coyne voiced the danger
when he asked : “In those working-men’s elec-
torates of the West, where we are now safe
LOADED.
and strong, shall we be mad enough to
commit political suicide?” The impression,
therefore, at the present moment is that, in
due course, should a Labor Government be
in power when the present pastoral leases
fall in, no difficulty will be met by the big
squatters in obtaining some kind of renewal.
Kidmanism may be a blight, as Bedford
says, but it has mostly grown to the dimen-
sions it has under the administration that
Bedford supports.—Yours, etc., 7PN.

Dear Bulletin, —The practically unani-
mous decision of the Government to proceed
with the construction of Canberra is likely
to be fraught with grave consequences to the
people of Australia. The world outlook has
radically changed since the “vision splendid”
of a capital city was born in the
aesthetic mind of some forgotten dreamer.
The great likelihood of the abandon-
ment of the Singapore Base project is
of vital concern to us, and menaces
our very existence. It is the sacred duty of
the Government to take immediate steps to
furnish adequate protection for its citizens
by the provision of necessary bases, arsenals
and, to a lesser extent, land defences. The
absence of these precautions, history teaches
us, has inevitably compassed the destruction
of defaulting nations in the past. How many
of us Australians realise that we are faced
with the great crisis of our nationhood?
Certainly not the Government, which, with
the failure of the last loan fresh in memory,
with the recent warning of General Monash
spoken direct to the people of Australia,
with the speeches of Earl Beatty and Ins
co-advisers at the Imperial Conference still
ringing in our ears, in cold blood proposes
to commit our country to the expenditure
of un-numbered millions (which must be
borrowed at an exorbitant rate) in the con-
struction of a Dream City. What shall it
profit us if we gain such a thing and lose
Australia? —Yours, etc., C. N. S.
*
From a mission-house in the Argentine:—
Australia has gone far ahead in the 30 years since
I left it, but it is still far behind us over here in
some things. For instance, I read in The Bulletin
of July 19, under the heading “Chaos in the Mar-
riage Market,” something that makes me think you
could take a leaf out of Arg( ntina’s book in regard
to marriage laws. Here, though we have a State
church, all marriages of rich and poor, aristocrats
and plebs., have to be celebrated at the Registro
Civil, before an official appointed for that purpose.
No clergyman—parson, priest, or rabbi —has the right
to marry. After the wedding has been celebrated,
before witnesses, at the Registry, and only at the
Registry, the clergyman may bless or consecrate the
union; but he must have the Registrar’s certificate
before him. The Civil Marriage is the only lawful
marriage, and the law punishes with fine and im-
prisonment any clergyman of any denomination who
performs a wedding ceremony before the contracting
parties have complied with the law referring to
Civil Marriage. Should any clergyman denounce the
Civil Marriage, and in any way try to belittle it,
the law can, and will, make things very uncomfort-
able for him. But, as a matter of fact, he doesn’t.
The law works with the utmost smoothness.

“Sobretodo” : Randolph Bedford asks (B.
31/l/’24) why his proposals that the Austra-
lian Governments should start direct retail
trading in meat, etc., in the U.S.A. are impos-
sible, and alleges that American law does not
forbid the establishment of foreign Govern-
ment undertakings on American soil. In
reply I do assure Mr. Bedford that no
foreign Government may establish or control,
in the name of the Government, any such
shops, warehouses, etc., as he suggests, within
the territorial jurisdiction of the United
States, without the consent of the Govern-
ment ; and I have the very highest authority
for saying that such consent would represent
a surrender of the sovereign rights of the Gov-
ernment of the United States. Mr. Bed-
ford proceeds to pass lightly over the
problem of the American food trusts; but
the idea of these corporations remaining
passive while we enter the lists against
them is not easily imagined, whether inland
transportation is negligible or not. As for
Government trading, with past experiences
to guide us it would be unreasonable to fore-
cast success along the lines mentioned ; the
optimism of the most unabashed socialist
would be liable to stagger under the burden.
Now that we have formally exchanged com-
pliments, I wish to express agreement with
Mr. Bedford’s proposition to cut out prefer-
ence—at least to whittle it down to the
amount John Bull gives us; but there
appears no motive for throwing Australia
into the arms of Uncle Sam. We would do
better to copy that gentleman’s example and
make our own land self-supporting.

Scott Fell and the Commonwealth have
won the second round of the fight with the
Limerick S. S. Co. over the requisitioning
of ships in wartime. The plaintiffs alleged
a fraudulent conspiracy between the defen-
dants and the Broken Hill cos. to use the
powers under the Act, not for any military
or naval purpose, but to serve the private
interests of Scott Fell and the B. 11. cos.
A jury, sitting with the Chief Justice, found
for the Limerick Co. The N. S. Wales Full
Court has reversed that finding: it could dis-
cover nothing in the evidence to support any
suggestion of conspiracy. As one Judge put
it in effect, both Scott Fell and the Lim-
erick Co. were out to make money; but that,
it was held, did not prove that there w r as a
conspiracy between the Commonwealth offi-
cials and Scott Fell. The case will now
go on to the Privy Council.

“Capricorn” : Because the A.W.U. award
exempts the employer of foreign labor of the
same nationality as himself, the Austra-
lian sugar grower in the districts between
Townsville and Mossman (where 37.7 per
cent, of last year’s crop was grown) is being
pushed out by Mussolini’s subjects. A
tribe of industrial inspectors watch the Aus-
tralian grower for failure to observe exact-
ing awards that his Italian competitor may
snap his fingers at; yet both collect the same
price for their cane. The Director of Sugar
Experiment Stations finished up his report
for last year by discounting the statements
made from time to time regarding the flood-
ing of the sugar industry by Italians; then,
unfortunately for his argument, he gave
figures which showed that sugar farmers up
that way were 33 per cent, foreign and cane-
eutfers 65 per cent, foreign:—

Totalling them up there are 1668 Britishers

latter. The Director claims that the in-
dustry is less than 10 per cent, foreign : but
merely claiming it will not help Australians.
—:
A parson who, after a dozen years in Aus-
tralia, last year returned to England, writes:
I often had doubts with regard to White Aus-
tralia. “Look at Africa,” I said to myself. Well,
I have been looking at it again. There is limitless
colored labor for cheap development, but along
with it an extraordinary lack of white enterprise.
The black man’s labor has dulled the white man’s
brain. It has robbed him of inventiveness. Further,
I reason thus: How is it that a well-favored coun-
try, half the distance from England that Australia
is, “colonised” for a considerably longer period, can
only show a white population cne-third that of
Australia ? So I make my belated confession of
faith in White Australia. If Australia, for the
sake of an ideal of righteousness, can invest nearly
500 millions and much blood on behalf of posterity,
can she not, for the ideal of racial purity, put up
with the expense of white development of her re-
sources ? And in the long run she will find that
she has chosen the part of the truest economy.
Don’t the relative positions of Australia and S.
Africa already prove it ?
*
“G.R.” : One instance of the way in which
Australia leans on John Bull is furnished
by the survey of our coasts and territorial
waters by the Admiralty at the cost of the
British taxpayer. Recently the Port Lyttel-
ton, an Australian-owned steamer, grounded
badly at the entrance to the Tamar River
in the Speck. At the inquiry it was elicited
that the chart in use at the time was 40
years old and did not disclose the danger
on which the ship came to grief. The Marine
Board of Launceston, instead of doing the
job for which it taxes all shipping entering
the port, “approached” the Minister of De-
fence. And Bowden, at his wits’ end to
know what to do, immediately cabled the
Director of the Naval Department asking
him to ascertain what the actual position
is. The actual position is this. The Marine
Board of Launceston wants the entrance to
its port surveyed at the cost of the British
taxpayer, who maintains an expensive survey
ship in Australian waters to do what Aus-
tralian authorities should do themselves, j-his
ship is H.M.S. Fantome, shortly to be re-
placed by H.M.S. Herald, now on her way.
She cost John Bull £95,000.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
This financial year Victoria proposes to
get through £10,242,000 of borrowed money
—£5,000,000 for railways, electricity and
water supply, which have at least a tangible
look, and the rest for oddments, including
the reconstruction of Pentridge Gaol for the
accommodation of posterity. And the inter-
est will be 6 per cent, or more. The average
scatterment of loan funds is now 7 12 times
that of the 20 years before 1911, and it is
nearly six times that of 1918. The Lawson
Government went mad in 1920, for no better
visible reason than that the disease had
become the fashion, and it has had no lucid
interval since.
Westralian Agent-General Colebatcli de-
livered a lecture in London the other day, in
which he told how Premier Mitchell, when
Minister of Agriculture 14 years ago, com-
menced “the first large-scale experiment of
placing comparatively inexperienced men on
virgin land in untried localities.” And, w r ith
a very few exceptions, he said, these men
w r ere now 7 prosperous farmers. Whereupon
many kind things wrnre said, and everybody’s
back was slapped. It is depressing to look
at figures after a shivoo like that. Westralia,
brought in 22,077 assisted “migrants” in
the 10 years 1912-21. In much the same 10
years (April 1911 to April 1921) the State
gained 45,754 new inhabitants in Perth, and
4345 outside Perth—so,o99 in ail. So the
whole new country population w 7 as not one-
fifth the number of assisted “migrants”
alone. .
The British dockers’ strike is the sort of
embarrassment that is extra-liable to come
to a Labor Government. A Bonar Law or
a Baldwin Cabinet would gain kudos if it
found a w 7 ay to put down a big strike. A
Macdonald Government may lose its job
if it doesn’t help one along. Therefore a
friend is more liable to be troubled this way
than an enemy. Last year the union leaders
agreed to a reduction of Is. per day, having
been convinced that the state of trade made
it inevitable. This year the employers
offered to restore the lost bob. but the' de-
mand was for 25., and on that being refused
120,000 men left work in one act. Wild
statements are made as to the profits of
the shipping cos. What Australia knows
best is the financial doings of its Common-
wealth line, and that concern can’t afford
to pay dockers an extra Is. per month, let
alone per day.
J. A. Harper, Liberal member for East
Torrens, has struck his name off the party
list of candidates, because he “cannot con-
scientiously support the action of the Bar-
well Government in placing an order with
America for upwards of £750,000 worth of
rolling-stock without making any serious
effort to keep portion of it in South Aus.”
Barwell, replying with the petula-nce that
has grown upon him, declares that his
Liberal Federation can get along without
Harper, and that, in a sense, is true.
Whether the Liberal Federation can get
along without the feeling which impelled
Harper to withdraw his candidature and
which animates countless other Australians
—the feeling that it is endangering the
national safety to depend on foreigners for
goods, such as railway material, which can
be made in Australia and are part of its
equipment against invasion—is another and
more important question which will be an-
swered when Barwell goes to the country.
From a cabled interview with the idealistic
British Prime Minister :
He regretfully admitted that warlike elements
were gaining ground in Germany, and was of
opinion that we had not used the best means to
support the moral elite in Germany.... The good
elements in German/ must be strengthened. The
imperialistic and bellicose ideas of the junkers must
be eradicated. France and Britain must co-operate
... .to eradicate everything bad in Europe.
No larger dream was ever dreamt than this
of a bright time coming when there shall be
a new/ junker and a new earth ; and the pic-
ture of France and Britain jointly removing
all sin from Europe would almost make small
devils weep.
The feelers throwm out to discover it
Britain would cede some West Indian islands
to the United States in part settlement of
sundry financial problems has moved the
new Prime Minister to say mildly that Bri-
tain has no intention of ceding anything. It
may acquire an intention, but it has none
THE THINKER.
“When asked what he proposed to do in regard to the admittedly unsatisfactory political situation,
Premier Lawson replied that he had nothing to say, except that he was thinking hard."
THE MAN IN THE STREET: “Don't you find it very dull sitting here in this muddle and
doing nothing?”
L AWSON: “Oh no, not at all. Like the bloke in The Bulletin, sometimes I sits and
thinks, and sometimes I just sits.”
at present. In these matters Uncle Sam
possibly owns the evil eye—things cer-
tainly come his way. At one time John Bull
considered that he owned all the Pacific coast
as far south as California. But the U.S.
•suddenly demanded everything as far north
as latitude 47deg. 40min. Britain went to
arbitration, and lost, even up to latitude 49.
Later there was a dispute about the extent
of the U.S. claims, as purchaser from Russia,
on half the remaining Canadian west coast.
Some ancient Russian map was the alleged
authority. In referring the matter to a
joint commission no disguise was made of
the fact that the U.S. half of it had its deci-
sion ready in its pocket. “Arbitrate as
much as you like,” said the President
breezily, “but there’s the map.” And Britain
naturally lost again. What would happen if
Uncle, as the heir of Spain in the West In-
dies (since the war of 1898), claimed the old
Spanish islands in a general fashion, and at
the same time offered to pay, and simultane-
ously clutched his sword?
The engineering and shipbuilding union
represents about the biggest and most highly-
skilled business which Britain possesses, and
its situation is described as “a tragedy ”
But Prime Minister Macdonald has a great
relief measure in view—a scheme to pro-
vide 120,000 Government houses the first
year and 200,000 a year afterwards. It
should brighten life considerably —especially
if the workless unemployed engineer and
shipbuilder can eat bricks and clothe his
wife in plaster.
Two or three hundred coke-workers have
thrown two or three thousand other work-
ers out of a job: they have driven orders
for at least 9000 tons of coke away from
Australia, and have shut down most of Hos-
kins’s works at Lithgow and numerous
smaller foundries, etc., elsewhere. Though
arbitration is the law of the land and is sup-
posed to be the Labor policy, they stubbornly
refuse to arbitrate, and so far no trades
hall or labor federation has attempted to
discipline them. Class consciousness means,
apparently, that you must be unconscious
of any crime or stupidity committed by your
own class.
Having cogitated for two months on the
Select Committee's report, Vic. Premier Law-
son has asked the Mayor of Melbourne to
convene a conference of metropolitan muni-
cipal councils to ascertain whether they are
in favor of buying out the gas company, lie
is willing to have controlling and borrowing-
powers vested in a body representing the
municipalities if they will to take on the
ownership. The Select Committee suggested
that the Metropolitan Board of Works or
something on the lines of the Electricity
Trust might meet the case. On present ap-
pearances, however, the municipalities will
tell Lawson to go ahead with a bill fixing
a minimum quality (probably on a heating
test) and a sliding scale of prices and divi-
dends.
The N.S.W. Government has just owned
up to a cheerful bit of brigandage. Imme-
diately the Government proclaims its intern
tion to acquire property for any public pur-
pose, it takes all rent or other revenue, and
allows the owner 4 p.c. on its valuation.
Sometimes the sale isn’t finalised for a year;
and though the Government may be drawing
10 p.c., it hangs on to all but 4 p.c. Tackled
on the question, Premier Fuller confessed,
apparently without a blush, that the rate
used to be 6 p.c. but was reduced to 4 p.c.
the better to “bring the owners to terms.”
The admitted intention being to squeeze the
owner into accepting the Government’s offer,
why not squeeze hard and make the interest
1 p.c.?
A “Political Point” last week prodded Dr.
Stopford, N. S. Wales M.L.A., where he
didn’t deserve it. It accused him of favor-
ing the lash for the sub-normal (in certain
cases of assault), the knife for the normal.
Actually Dr. Stopford suggests surgery for
the sub-normal —either that or segregation for
life. Apparently it is the normal who are
to get the lash, though it isn’t obvious how
Authority is going to sort out the two lots.
There is a growing belief in Westralia
that another Labor Government will arrive
in that country after the general election
next month. The Jarrah State is divided
into 50 electoral districts, and on the one-
vote-one-value principle each district (taking
the latest figures available) should have 3392
electors. But 002 electors return a Labor
member in Cue, 053 in Leonora, 708 in Yil-
garn, 1000 in Magnet, 1042 in Murchison
and 1109 in Coolgardie. Moreover, Mt. Mar-
garet (448 electors) and Menzies (449)
were Labor pocket-boroughs till the con-
scription split, and one is sure to be re-
gained, if not both. In a country where
340,000 people are spread over 975,920 square
miles, a strict application of the one-vote-
one-value principle is, of course, impossible,
but a scheme of redistribution such as the
last Labor Government introduced (and
dropped) in 1913 would have deprived the
A.L.P. of five seats. By not passing a
Redistribution Bill when he had the numbers
Premier Mitchell presented Labor with these
five seats. The indications are that he will
regret it.
On the same day last week it was an-
nounced that India and S’Africa had given
out big contracts for railway material, and
that Germany had secured them both. The
Briton wasn’t within 23 per cent, of the Ilun
price. Yet the Rammac Government thinks
it can keep control of its home market with-
out Protection. Some British unemployment
figures are available to July, 1923. In the
tobacco industry 267 employees per 1000
were out of work; in engineering and ship-
building 222; and in pottery 171.
Few men know the world better than J. H.
Curie, who wrote “The Shadow Show”
and “This World of Ours.” Of Singapore
he says: “It is the most strategic site in all
the seven seas.” And that was written ten
years ago. One “objection” to it for naval-
base purposes is that it is near passages
and islands. As a matter of fact, most of
Britain’s great naval victories have been
fought near islands and narrow passages.
Brest, Quiberon Bay, Copenhagen and the
Nile, with the many encounters in the West
Indies and off the Dutch coast, were all
amongst islands or - shoals. Even in the
last war the battles were Heligoland, Dogger
Bank, Cocos, Falkland Islands, Jutland,
Zeebrugge and Ostend; while the bases were
Scapa, Rosyth, Dover and Kiel. Even St.
Vincent and Trafalgar depended on the Strait
of Gibraltar.
On an industrial innovation:—
In spite of strenuous opposition from the
union, the N.S.W. Board of Trade has granted the
Broken Hill Prop, permission to train 15 adults as
bricklayers, the only reservation being that they
shall be near the apprenticeship age. The Master-
builders’ Association has also obtained the right to
train three over-age apprentices. Although the
number of men is small, a big principle is involved
which the unions will fight hard wherever they see
a chance of fighting successfully. At the Lithgow
ironworks the brickies went on strike rather than
allow improvers to be employed, although full wages
were offered. The opposition to the Broken Hill
Prop.’s claim was based on a suspicion that the 00.
wanted men for a special class of work and would leave
them uninstructed in other branches of the trade.
Australia has a dismal surplus of “laborers,” and
now that the bottom has fallen out of the loan
market it will have to grapple seriously with the
job of making skilled workers of the young ones.
But the training should be such as to summarily
dispose of the contention that there is an insidious
design to turn out a multitude of inferior crafts-
men, useful only for wage-reducing purposes.
A year or so ago, when the A.W.U. was
extorting one of its periodical levies for the
Sydney daily that never comes out, it was
here mildly suggested that the money in
sight might be more fruitfully invested in a
sheep-station, since the union knew some-
thing about sheep. Sydney Worker took
nearly a page to say that the suggestion was
beneath contempt. The following is from
the same paper’s report of the recent A.W.U.
Convention :
Mr. Foster, manager of Labor Papers, Ltd., said
that the loss on the Hobart World last year (the
A.W.U. has been financing the Hobart World) was
£BOOO. This included £2OOO interest on the
accumulated losses; these, according to another dele-
gate, amounted to £31,000 Mr. Cahill said that.
the A.W.U. organisers and others had had to put up
with all sorts of abuse in collecting the levy during
the past two or three years, and after all their hard
work they found the directors deliberately throwing
the money away. it was decided that the World
“be placed in the hands of selling agents forth-
with.”
The deliberations were brightened by refer-
ences to “treachery,” “another dead horse,”
“dingoes,” “putting the boot in,” “a stink
in the nostrils” and “blackmailing unionists
for the ten-bob levy.” They all came from
gents, who believe most fervently, or say
they do, in the socialisation of industries.
WHAT WOMEN WANT.
The Bulletin
“The Manchester Guardian says that Conserva-
tive headquarters are urging local branches to select
younger candidates, preferably between 25 and 30,
as women voters show preference for such.”
lie’s handicapped at last, there’s no gainsaying,
When for elections up the numbers go,
The gent, whose locks are whitening or greying
And round whose eyes has trod “the hateful crow.”
Time was when wit and wisdom were credentials,
When eloquence would keep M.P.’s afloat,
But clearly these are not the first essentials
Now Phyllis has the vote.
Wisdom and width still go too oft together,
Just as in Tony Weller’s day (and case) ;
And more and more it seems a question whether
They’ll carry the appeal of youthful grace
Upon the hustings where the gas-lamps glisten,
Or in the halls by stamping bluchers shook,
When only half the voters come to listen —
The other half to look.
Can shoulders bent and corrugated forehead
Divert for long the favor of the fair
From faces smooth, complexions fresh and florid,
White, gleaming teeth and sleek or curly hair?
Youth will be served —and will have youth to serve
her;
For all she cares, when once she’s picked her horse,
Experience, logic, fluency and fervor
May finish down the course.
Now that for votes no more need woman hunger,
Whom would she have her claims and aims to
voice ?
Well, don’t forget she’d like her spokesmen younger,
Chaps in their radiant twenties still —for choice.
Platforms and creeds may doubtfully arrest her,
But never will she hesitate a jiff
Between a blithe Adonis and a Nestor
Encumbered with a ziff.

Ten years ago Daily Telegraph shares
were at fancy prices ; handsome profits were
being earned, and besides paying regular
324 p.c. divs. the directors each year ladled
out bonus scrip. Between 1900-13 £162,358
was distributed in divs., £133,566 of earn-
ing: made during that period were capi-
talised. and £38,298 was visibly added to
reserves. Under the wild delusion that the
annual shower of bonus scrip would continue
indefinitely, 10 years ago the shares (then
£3.0 fully-paids) were bought at £65. Since
then only one transfer of reserves lias been
made (in 1919), and three-fifths even of
that lot came from surpluses stored away
during the period when annual bonus issues
were the custom. Last year’s 10 p.c. div.
gave the buyer at £65 only a trifle more than
2 p.c. on his investment, even allowing for
the 1919 free shares. Investors who were
misled by the annual scrip-bonuses into buy-
ing at stiff: prices may be excused if they
regard the blue light, which the D.T. now
nightly displays on the tower of its premises,
as a symbol of the color of their duck. To
old hands the 10 p.c. rate is, of course, giving
an excellent return ; but even they must be
perturbed when considering the narrow
margin of surplus profit and the serious de-
cline of earnings in recent years.
For the eight years to 1915 net profits
averaged almost £46.900 p.a. The average
for 1915-23 was £33.300. Last year’s profits
were £13,085 less than the 1907-15 average,
and that decline meant 3.3 p.c. on paid capi-
tal. , Earnings have been erratic in recent
years, partly because of abnormal conditions;
for instance, the slenderness of 1922 earn-
ings was due to the necessity for writing
£18,130 off paper stocks to bring values
down to market level. However, the D.T.
has other troubles besides high production
costs. The directors have been experiment-
ing. A few years ago they imported D. D.
Braham from England to succeed Dr. Ward
as editor; a couple of years ago Farmer
Whyte . took the editor’s chair; now ex-
S. M. Herald editor T. W. Ileney takes
charge. This newest appointment is a com-
pliment to a veteran, but in face of the com-
petition of the Guardian and the Laror
Daily (the almost defunct Daily Mail
resuscitated under A.L.P. control), the re-
capturing of ground lost by the D.T. is
hardly a job for a veteran who never dis-
tinguished himself particularly on the news
side—and news never counted for more in a
newspaper than it does to-day. Concurrently
R. W. Robson, who succeeded Watkin Wynne
as g.-m., lias dropped out to represent the
D.T. in London. Shareholders are taking
a livelier interest; on this occasion, the
three retiring directors are opposed by three
other shareholders. Incidentally, during the
past 12 months the co. lost by death its old
chairman and vice-chairman, Henry Gorman
and Randal Carey ; and Robt. Sands, another
old-timer on the board, retired.
The great financial strength reached by the
co. in its prosperous years is still maintained.
At December 31 outside liabilities amounted
to only £5358, and on the other side were
Government securities, bank shares, fixed de-
posits and cash totalling £88,784. Book
debts totted up £49,264, and stocks of paper,
etc., were valued at £28,214. The King-
street building, constructed in days when
costs were low, has a book value of approxi-
mately £185,000. Lately the directors have
been considering whether it would not pay
better to shift the plant and machinery to a
less expensive locality, and remodel the pre-
sent premises to give maximum rentals... With,
that object in view, they have purchased a
site near the Central Railway Station, and
are seeking shareholders’ permission to pro-
ceed with the erection of buildings. It is
a scheme that calls for a lot of chewing over.

Squatting Investment had another year
better than the average, but as in the pre-
vious one earnings were assisted by Bawra.
Interests in that Association were not taken
in with assets, so the liquidation of certifi-
cates and shares has put large sums into
Profit and Loss. Last year £4OlO flowed
in in that way. but before arriving at the
profits in the table £BOOO for f.uture taxation
was charged against earnings, besides the
£6OBl taken by assessments during the
period. Improved wool prices meant a lot
to the co.; the year's clip gave 1587 bales
of greasy wool and 14 bales of scoured, and
1545 of the greasy realised £50,670. live-
stock contributed £0648. The 10 p.c. distri-
buted was not all dividend, however; share-
holders were told to regard two-thirds of it
a “bonus” representing a return of capi-
tal. Since 1912 17s. per 70s. share paid to
60s. has been returned in this way, and 11
years ago the directors announced that when
the bonuses amounted to 10s. per share “the
necessary steps would be taken to reduce the
capital accordingly.” Final approval was
given by the Court only this year, and the
co. has been given the power to write off the
uncalled liability of 10s. per share, and to
reduce the 60s. paids to 30s. The reason
for this adjustment is that the Squatting
Investment’s 1018 sq. miles of Western
Queensland is held under lease with only
about 11 years to run. Instead of writing
down book values from time to time and
creating a sinking fund for the protection
of capital, the directors adopted the prac-
tice of distributing cash whenever possible
by way of “bonuses.”
In view of the proposed writing down of
shares by 305., against 17s. actually returned
since the directors’ first announcement of
their intention to write down capital, it is
not clear how the co.’s position will be
altered by the reconstruction. At December
31 cash and War Loan (£10.000) totted up
£46,083. Deducting the final div. and
“bonus,” £21,749 was left, and that was
£13,215 more than all outside liabilities, in-
cluding £BOOO taxation provision. The cash
surplus represented only 2s. 9d. per share,
so the co. is not in the position to refund
in cash much of the 13s. difference between
the amount per share to be written off and
the actual payments made. Assuming that
no cash is paid out in the reconstruction the
effect will be as follows. Capital will be
£146.002, in 97,335 30s. shares fully-paid.
Liquid assets will be made up of £13,215
surplus of cash and Government securities
over and above liabilities, £9893 of book
debts, £5418 of plant and stores, £1644 un-
sold clip (conservatively valued), and live-
stock with a book value of £49,786. also a
conservative figure, because stock-taking was
made on the basis of the depressed values of
12 months previously. All these items tot
up £79,956. But in addition the co. holds
8038 Bawra Is. shares, worth about
£4700 in the market, after the recent
distribution of -9s. per share (£3617).
Accepting these valuations, approximately
£57,000 of capital will be represented by
leases which will expire in 11 years, and by
improvements to the properties in which the
co. may hold tenant-right, and which may
be worth something even if the leases are
not renewed. About 18s. per 30s.
share will be represented by the book
value of more or less liquid assets,
and that will leave 12s. more for
the management to find within 11 years
after paying divs. Everything, of course,
depends upon the seasons and markets
experienced during that period, and finally
on what happens to the leases. The buyer
who has been offering 28s. in the market
lately looks as though he has hopes of re-
newal, and he has failed to attract a seller
at that price.

Latest disclosed profits were much better
than the average, of recent years, but rela-
tively poorer than those of a few years ago.
Much additional capital is, however, at work
now; hence, while last year’s profits barely
sufficed to pay 8 p.c., smaller ones paid 10
p.c. a few years ago. The slackness of tlie
frozen-meat export trade —-the co. has a lot
of capital tied up in refrigerating works
has been chiefly responsible for keeping earn-
ings down, and the milk trade is also
more difficult than it used to be. For several
years price-fixing and drought troubles re-
stricted earnings in that branch, and lately
competition has been fierce. Making allow-
ances for the poorer returns from handling
two of its big lines, the co. has done well
to earn 8 p.c. divs.; they have been possible
because the management developed other
interests, ice-making in particular. When
the meat-export trade revives and milk flows
easier, better profits can be expected; but it
always has been a business °f . U P S
downs, and the only satisfactory view of re-
sults is to be got by averaging them over
a period of years.
The published accounts are not informa-
tive ; they do not show how earnings are
derived, one entry alone stating the “net
profit” after unspecified amounts have been
written off for depreciation, bad debts, etc.
On the published figures the co. is £852
poorer than it was four years ago, after
paying an average of 84 p.c. p.a. on capital
—a capital which has been increased to
permit the purchase of the freehold of works-
sites and of additional machinery and plant.
Actual results, however, depend on how
appropriations for specific reserves compare
with positive requirements. In three years
paid capital has moved from £182,514 to
£253,901, and the following table shows how
the new funds have been put to work, and
also gives comparisons over eight years :

nevertheless, continue to hold Commonwealth
securities with a book value of £28,966, and
that gilt-edged stuff, stocks and book debts
totted up £123,756, which was nearly £24,000
more than all outside liabilities.

Just prior to the closing of the 1022 accounts
tliis co.'was successful in an application for
permission to shelter under the wing of the N.
S. Wales Gas Act. This virtually placed it on
an S p.c. basis, because, provided the co.
conforms to the various regulations of the
Act, the; directors can always seek a re-
adjustment of the “standard price” to give
that div. rate if working costs become oppres-
sive. The form of the accounts has been
altered to comply with "the requirements of
the Act, and are consequently presented in
much greater detail. The figures in the
table are the net profits, the appropriations
for depreciation and “special purposes”
allowed by the Act not having been taken
into account. Cos. are permitted to charge
up to 34 p.c. p.a. on the total outlay on
assets employed in manufacturing and dis-
tributing gas, and the total .of the fund at
any time must not exceed 10 p.c. During
the past 12 months this Manly gasworks
took £4322 for the depreciation reserve, com-
pared with £3260 for the previous year, but
though that larger allowance partly
accounted for the shrinking of profits, addi-
tional working costs were the principal cause.
Here are figures for the two years:—
„ 1922. 1923.

Gas sales .. £53,581 £53,549
Residuals, etc.. . 5,620 8,232
Total .. £59,201 £61,781

Distribution .. 7,040 5,154
Taxes and rents 1,964 2,217
Management .. 3,636 4,785
£46,423 £49,367
The improved return from residuals appears
to have saved the position. As it was, the
net profit fell £1474 short of the 8 p.c. div..
and the carry-forward balance dwindled to
£734.
The co.’s field was cut into last year by
electricity ousting gas for street-lighting, but
the Manly district is developing so rapidly
that increased private consumption counter-
balanced that loss. The rapid development
of the enterprise is shown by the following
comparisons for five-year periods :

to increase nominal capital to £200,000 by
creating 80,000 new shares.

£30,000 of capital returned.
Vale of Clwydd colliery has been better than
most gold-mines. Three issues of gift scrip
were made between 1913-21, £15,000 worth
being.passed out on each occasion; and that
made the 10 to 20 p.c. div. something very
glittersome indeed. In the past 12 months
shareholders struck another bonanza. Be-
sides getting dividends equal to 35 p.c. on
original capital, they had 6s. Bd. per share
promised to them, ostensibly as a return of
capital; but owing to delays caused by legal
processes this money did not come to them
till after the year closed. This comparison
of the . liquid position over 10 years shows
how cash surpluses accumulated
Dec., ' Dec., June, Dec.,
1913. 1922. 1923. 1923.
Liquid assets . . £23,424 £68,975 £75,254 £75,744
Liabilities. . . . 1,108 779 1,841 2,570
Surplus . . £22,316 £68,196 £73,413.£73,174
Between 1913-1923 £91,500 of divs. were
paid .on £45,000 of cash-paid capital, and
meanwhile £50,858 was added to the surplus
of liquid assets over and above all outside
liabilities. At December 31 last £28,628 was
held in cash and £30,229 in public securities
and other investments, so the £30,000 return
of capital in January was easily found. Ex-
tracting that sum and the half-year’s div.
from the accumulations, the co.’s position
was still much like Gibraltar’s; the liquid
surplus then amounted to £36,424, which was
equal to Bs. Id. per share fully paid to 13s. 4d.
The figures in the introductory table do
not disclose the full extent of the riches
which have poured out, because profits dis-
played there are only the earnings announced
by the directors plus additions to visible re-
serves, and do not include the regular appro-
priations for depreciation. Obviously more
than was actually required under that head
was laid aside. But the investor should not
be misled into believing that the co. can con-
tinue indefinitely to produce similar hand-
some returns. The co.’s Lithgow mine is
a steadily wasting asset, and the future of
the business depends on the extent of seams
still available in the 1000 acres of freehold
and 941 acres of leasehold controlled by the
co., on its ability to find new coal properties,
on future markets for the fuel and on labor
conditions. As to that future, points to be
taken into account are that the railways, by
far the biggest users of Western coal, may
develop their own properties (certainly will
under a Labor Government) ; on the other
hand, it is possible that the extension of the
rail to Broken Hill will give the Western
mines a new customer. In any case, all ex-
cept ss. 3d. per share is now represented by
assets apart from the mine and its equip-
ment ; and, to fully protect capital against
the time when the colliery ceases operations,
only £24,000 has to be recovered after pay-
ing divs. and maintaining machinery and
plant in good running order. Divs. of 10 p.c.
p.a. wfill in future require £3OOO per half-
year. and allowing for the loss of interest on
the £30,000 returned to shareholders recent
performances suggest that under existing
trading conditions no difficulty should be ex-
perienced in paying that rate. The market,
however, evidently expects big things of Vale
of Clwydd; 225. 6d. is being offered for the
13s. 4d. share, and at that figure colliery
and equipment are valued at approximately

£65,000. Ten p.e. divs. would return only
6 p.c. on that market price. But it is signi-
ficant that the last distribution was not at
so much p.c.: it was “Is. 6d. per share.”
And even “Is. per share” per half-year means
15 p.c. p.a. on the reduced capital, or slightly
under 9 p.c. on the market price.
Feldlieim, Gottlielf, Ltd., merchants, of
Sydney, have decided that they are no longer
.able to conduct their affairs successfully, and
are therefore offering the assets as a whole
■or in parcels to the highest bidders. The
business has been established more than half
a century, but the old principals do not
now figure in it; the present co. took over
in September, 1910, and there are 80 share-
holders, including the Dixson Trust (VVm.
Dixson is the co.’s chairman). It began
by paying £20.000 for goodwill, but that item
and the preliminary expenses account were
struck out in 1914 by writing 4s. off each
of the 130,000 £l-paid ordinaries. Paid
capital is now £110,500, including £6500 pf
0 p.c. prefs. During the boom war-years
the co. appeared to be making excellent
profits: £8864 for the year ended May, 1917,
was followed by £20,168 for 1918, £13.883
for 1919, and £22,736 for 1920. The direc-
tors distributed only 71 p.c. p.a. in the three
good years, and by 1920 they thought they
had accumulated £37,000-odd of surplus
profits. For the 1921 financial year the
accounts disclosed a profit of £3758. and
only the prefs. received a div.; for 1922 and
1923 losses of £30,937 and £21,226 were re-
corded and no divs. whatever were paid. At
May 31 last all visible reserves had disap-
peared and Profit and Loss was £21,226 to
the bad. A directors’ report issued in
■October last declared that profit-earning had
improved and that prospects were brighter.
ithin a few months, however, accountants
Smith and Johnson were called in to examine
the patient, and last week shareholders, hav-
ing been convinced that the co., “by reason
■of its liabilities, could not continue busi-
ness,” took the final plunge and appointed the
investigating. accountants liquidators.
One trouble has been over-dependence on
outsiders to finance operations; at May 31
last, against £110,500 of paid capital, the
management owed £148,109 to trading credi-
tors, the bank and other financiers (includ-
ing some of the shareholders), and there was
a blister of £64,000 on the elaborate ware-
house which was erected ‘seven years ago.
It is the old, old story; funds are always at
command while a business prospers, but the
moment the tide runs out creditors are liable
to demand their money in a .hurry. This
embarrassment has been directly responsible
for Fddheim, Gottlielfs downfall, but in
addition trading operations have been so
unsatisfactory that there was little prospect
of raising the fixed capital necessary to sat-
isfy creditors and resuscitate the business,
for that state of affairs the management can-
not plead that it has been entirely the vic-
tim of circumstances over which 'it had no
control.
Creditors are assured payment in full,
but how shareholders will fare in the liquida-
tion is not clear. The appreciation of city
property values will probably save them
trom a severe loss: a recent valuation by
riardie and Gorman places the value of the
warehouse at £lOO.OOO. which is £26 649
more than its book value. Whether there
will be a buyer at that figure—which, bv the
way, more than covers the I’, and L. debit—
may be another matter. For the rest, every-
thing depends on prices realised on stocks
m a forced sale. A preliminary estimate by
the liquidators of stocks of hardware, glass-
ware. stationery, patent medicines, tobacco
supplies, jewellery, electron! ate. snorting
goods, toys, etc., runs into £153.000. Tenders
are to be called when stocktaking has been
completed.
Geologist E. C. St. Smith, now g.-m. of
Mt. Isa, Ltd., arrived on the field last week,
and his job is to get shafts down immedi-
ately. Estimates of probable ore reserves
are large, even on surface evidence. A dozen
11 tb. 100 ft. will show whether
the big advance in shares is warranted. Even
that shallow depth should show great fe-
serves, so wide is the ore-bearing belt.
A hether Mt. Isa will be another Broken Hill
cannot be apparent for a year or two yet,
although the optimists already think it' is.
A±t. Isa, Ltd., has £40,000 to spend on pros-
pecting work, and this will mainly go into
shallow shafts and connections, with per-
haps a couple down to 500 ft. to give some
clue to probabilities at depth.
The second Mt. Isa float, the Proprietary,
went off in a few hours: the 80,000 shares
oi os. each were more than doubly subscribed,
lhe co. has been formed to acquire “options
m purchase over the following leases: Even
Break, Out on Her Own. Durban Angel,
- t. Argyle and Ibus. The option-sellers
receive 60.000 fully-paids and £2500 cash,
biit the purchase of options and properties
2 ™ n “to £41.250—£15,000 in shares
and the balance in cash. Several of the
blocks have excellent prospects; and if they
develop satisfactorily there will probably be
off-shoot cos., the leases not being contiguous.
Lauder has stopped work at its Orallo (Q.)
bore, and is waiting for casing, some of which
will have to come from the U.S.A. Share-
holders are thus likely to have a consider-
ably longer wait than the five weeks pre-
dicted to see whether a “well” will be brought
in. C. F. V. Jackson and L. C. Ball officially
visited the bore a fortnight ago and procured
samples. As Minister Jones broadcasted D,
C. Milsom’s statement without any official
corroboration, the publication of the officials'
conclusions should not be withheld from the
public a day longer than is necessary.
Coastal Oil Concessions has been dogged
by hard luck in its boring campaign at
Tewantin (Q.). The first bore was aban-
doned on account of heavy water; the pre-
sent one has just struck a tremendous arte-
sian gusher at about 120 ft.. and outside
advice is being called in to endeavor to shut
off the deluge. H. I. Jensen thinks there
are possibilities of oil supplies in the ter-
tiaries at Tewantin, but the basin is a small
one and is reckoned to bottom at about 800 ft.
The stopes in the Eclipse mine, Brook-
field (Q.), are looking fairly well: in several
Sin. of mineralised quartz is showing. Owing
to the number of veins, the workings rather
resemble a rabbit warren at present. The
principal development has been an Bft. forma-
tion carrying a foot of quartz on the foot-
wall, Him on the hanging wall and Bin.
in the centre. This is well worth driving on,
but so far no definite statement of values
can be arrived at: here and there the foot-
wall ore runs into ounces, but the veins have
not been properly sampled yet. It is doubt-
ful whether it will pay to work the whole
bang lot, as is at present suggested. The
new Ross mill has been given a run.
Kan own a Red Hill (W.A.) is adding its
bit to Dorrie Doolette’s reputation as a mine-
selector. It has given a profit of £2S7G from
the rich shoots opened up at 03ft., 23!)0oz.
having been squeezed from 2142 tons. The
co. had £5367 cash in hand at the balance,
so some shareholders have been hopeful of
a div. But William Orr, one of the sit-
tight brigade, is on the Board, and he has
probably got Tom Birkbeck and Doolette
into his way of thinking i-especting the pur-
chase of a compression plant to replace the
present dependence on the North White
Feather for power. The div. outlook is,
therefore, misty. Besides, Doolette wants
the Ivanowna reef tested to 60ft., and cash
is needed for the work.
* * * *
A recent Mines Department report dis-
closes why Brown’s Reward (W.A.) left
Yalgoo and took an option at Kalgoorlie.
The few rich patches in Reward pinched
out at shallow depths, and efforts to pick
them up again were unsuccessful. Other
rich shoots may be found near the surface,
but it is considered unlikely that the mine
will ever produce much payable ore.
A Perth syndicate has optioned the May
Queen, Southern Cross. For 15 years the
owners have worked a narrow 50z.-vein, fol-
lowing it to a depth of about 200 ft.
Lloyd George (W.A.) is now run by five
tributors, the co. confining its own attention
to the sands. A six weeks’ run on 1650 tons
gave £547 worth of gold, and the tributors
crushed 303_tons ore from above the 100 ft.
level for 187 (oz. They are also prospecting
from the south winze at 160 ft. in the hope
of locating the ore-body which somersaulted
and then disappeared thereabouts. The
Lloyd George has been Westralia’s worst
disappointment since the Hampton Plains
collapse.
* * *
Langi Logan South. Ararat (Vic.),
started life as a lusty spender by prodding
around in the shallow w r ashes. Only when
New Langi had pumped an ocean of water
out of the Langi gutter did it descend to the
main lead, and there calls have been
soaked up. Now a brain-wave has hit Pea-
cock’s staff; it believes that, despite all opera-
tions, the tributary worked through the
Cathcart Central mine to the New Langi
gutter and cleaned up into the New Langi
is not the Cathcart lead. So South Langi
is out with a circular announcing that the
mine is to be re-opened and a rise put up to
catch that elusive Pimpernel. This might be
an attractive go had the lower reaches of the
Cathcart gutter inside the Cathcart Central
boundary given good stuff. Instead, gold
was_ scarce there, and it was not seen again
until in the vicinity of the junctioning of
the tributary with the main lead. New Langi
is getting some gold on high ground, but not
enough to give divs.; so on the score of its
gold return there is no justification for re-
opening the South. The fizzle over Duke
Extended and high-level washes should be
too recent to be forgotten.
Alex. Peacock’s office has a move on over the
South Durham (Vic.). This sliindicat went
to the rescue of Ballarat deep-lead mining as
the result of prospecting done on the old
Durham lead, which bottomed on a nugget
or two. Boring has been carried out to de-
fine the course of the gutter, and the cry is
that the prospects from the bore justify'the
formation of a co. in 50.000 10s. shares. The
boring done means nothing more than that
a lead exists, and too much value should not
be placed on a sample from the drill. How-
ever, the new co. is full of faith.
* * * *
South New Moon, Bendigo, must have spent
several thousands in the pursuit of that will-
o'-the-wisp, “good gold in the bottotp of the
level."’ In this case it is the 1780 ft. level.
In a similar chase last year Bird’s Reef spent
a small fortune on equipping and on baling
for several months. Finances suddenly failed
just as the mine, was unwatered, and before
a shot was put into the allegedly auriferous
stone. In the South Moon the story was
backed by an affidavit and other evidence of
sincere belief. When the 1780 ft. level was
reached after months of baling, everything
was found as described-—with one exception;
the gold vvas not “good.” There is gold, but
so far it is not payable. However, further
work may uncover a reward for the co.’s
pluck.
W. G. Gillett’s attempt to infuse life into
the Peak Mines, Cobar (N.S.W.), having
failed, . the Alan Davis stable is giving the
proposition attention. Of the 800,000 con-
tribs. about 30.000 have been applied for at
JSpbar, and, (Sydney interests are negotiating
the balance. The SO acres to be taken over
include the pick of the Peak area.
If optimism alone counted, manager
McWilliams, of Carter’s Hill, Rockloy
(N.S.W.), is stabling a sure winner.
The “best development to date” has again
occurred, a couple of shots into the reef at
No. 2 level having disclosed “strong colors
of gold in a 24ft. reef of improved quality,”
So far there is no news from the battery.
* * * *
Acting on the advice of 0. Lonsdale Smith,
who recently took charge, Dumbrell’s Bygoo,
Ardlethan (N.S.W.), is issuing 50,000 profs,
of 2s. each, payable by threepenny instal-
ments. The cash is required to locate ore
shoots, and put the battery into working con-
dition.

North Mt. Farrell (Tas.) won £1457 profit
for the first half of last year from 9330 tons
ore, and £5674 from 10,220 tons during the
six months to December. Of course, the
lead-market boom was responsible. This is
how costs worked out: £lB.ooo was spent
to win and treat 10.220 tons in the second
term, and £13,400 to handle 9330 tons in
the first half. Smelting and realisation
charges were £13,400 against £10.940. The
10,220 tons gave a marketable product of
1458 tons, but not a whisper is given of the
grade, either of the ore or of the concen-
trates ; consequently, it is impossible to tell
whether mill work is good or bad. No. 7
level north has drifted out of the barren
patch, and 40ft. of good-grade ore has been
driven on. South, at 212 ft. poor stuff stopped
the drive, but a winze indicates average-
grade ore underfoot. Because of the fault-
ing in the stopes at No. 6, ore reserves run
into about 20.000 tons; 7760 tons are above
No. 6, and 11.250 above No. 7. with a pro-
bable patch of 1400 tons at the north end
of No. 6. North Farrell is no bigger than
it was six months ago, and it must hustle
with shaft-sinking if reserves are to hold.
Financially tilings could hardly help being
better with a boom market for mine products.
At the balance cash totted up £3483. and
marketable ore on hand was valued at. £7737.
“Mining Engineer” in reply :
“Talpa,” (B. 7/ 2/ ’24) perverts my meaning. All
seepages of oil, of course, are not sure indications
of a big oil supply, any more than the presence of
gold in some of the Bondi sandstones is an induce-
ment to bore for goldmines in the Hawkesbury
sandstones indiscriminately. But seepages of oil or
other recognised tangible oil signs must be a better
warrant for boring than no oil or sign of oil.
The accidental finds in the Commodore Rivadavia
(Argentine) and other districts is surely no argu-
ment in favor of blind stabbing. Anyway, it took
15 years for the Commodore Rivadavia section to
develop up to the 2,000,000-barrel mark in 1922.
“Talpa” knows without my telling him that repu-
table oil-geologists put the odds at *l5O to 1 for
successful “wild catting,” eveti in well-known oil
districts. How much greater must the odds be in
unknown areas in the Commonwealth!
The pools mentioned in Texas were lucky tosses.
The Electra pool is reasonably close to the great
Burkburnett pool, and finds there probably did not
surprise the experts. The Signal Hill find in the
Eos Angeles district was lucky “wild catting,” but
it was within shooting distance of a long-known
oil-field, Los Angeles. The Eldorado pool, too, was
in a State which is a fairly large producer. Cali-
fornia, about which Van der Leek lays down con-
ditions, produced 139,000,000 barrels in 1922. No
cne will dispute his opinion on an oil district like
California, but in the Commonwealth we have no
•Signal Hills to dogmatise about—not yet.
Once oil is found in Australia and we get data
as to its occurrence, then those with money to burn
may go “wild catting” with a shade of reason in
their favor. Meanwhile I prefer to stand pat on
oil seepages and other signs.

“Hamer”: What in the average novel
would be the last chapter has been written
in a romance which began in Sydney 30
years ago. That was a time of roses for a
pair of youthful sweethearts —until the girl
attended a lecture which contained one
of the early blasts on the question of
eugenics. A serious girl, she went home
thinking of a brother who was fighting a
losiivt battle with consumption, and of an
uncle who had died of the same disease; and
the result was an announcement that she
intended never to marry. For five years her
lover waited, hoping she would change her
mind; then they drifted apart. But they
never went quite out of touch, although they
have mostly been at opposite ends of the
earth. Eventually they met again in Aus-
tralia, and the lady yielded to persuasion.
Their marriage caused surprise and some
smiling amongst people who knew’ nothing of
the history of the case; those who did
know something of it rightly opined that the
spinster considered herself to have readied
an age vdien the eugenics spectre could be
disregarded. And now the whisper passes
amongst some amazed friends that this con-
viction was premature.
“Topee”: Although I have been in more
than one campaign, the horrors of warfare
were never brought home more vividly than
when I read in the daily-paper cables of
February 11 that Mr. Bruce, while visiting
another spot in the Dardanelles, not far
from the Lancashire landing, “recalled that
here during the war he ran out of tooth-
paste, and for three days was compelled to
use tobacco-ash.” The item reminded me
of a story, current in my boyhood, about a
namesake of our Prime Minister who did
his bit before Sebastopol in 1855-56. The
dialogue that told of his sufferings ran some-
thing like this: “Did you know Bruce of
Ours?” “No, wdiat of him?” “The poor
deah fellow had to eat goats’ flesh in the
Cwimea !”• “Good God! Did he daie?”
“Oh, of course he daied!”
“T e P a n a” :
Part of my job
with the Raraton-
gan soldiers -who
passed through
Sydney in 1917
was to question
recruits in regard
to family matters.
Somebody had told
the boys that the
missus was due for
three bob, and each
child for Is. 6d. a
day, separation
allowance. The
consequence was
that of 135 exam-
ined I found all
w T ere married, and
that families
ranged in numbers
from eight to four-
teen. It the state-
ments made to me
could have been
substantiated,
Raratonga would
have ranked as the
most prolific part
of the British Em-
pire. Unfortu-
nately, later inves-
tigations (on the
spot) disclosed
that the majority
had claimed children who —-in the local
phrase—“belongum other fellow.”

On going to Hell, from the Bar table: —
Recently a child of “tender years” was called as
a witness in a Sydney police court and the magis-
trate, in the usual course, examined the yotmgster as
to his knowledge of an oath and what would happen
to him if he told a lie. The youthful witness
answered promptly “Go to Hell, sir.” This is
almost invariably the answer of the child. if,
however, he is not drilled beforehand, anl says
“Don’t know,’’ he may still be examined, if the
magistrate be satisfied that he understands the duty
of speaking the truth. The test is not severe; as a
rule the answer shows on the surface. In a country
court lately a “pommy” was put in the box and under-
went the usual examination. He was rather at sea in
his theology, being wholly unacquainted with the
Devil. “Well,” said the P.M., “have you ever heard
of God?” At this the witness brightened up. “Yes,
sir,” he replied. “And where, my lad —at Sundav-
LOVE ALL.
“I thought you would only talk to clever women?"
“Oh, I’m not fussy. To tell the truth, I never notice much differ-
ence between them and the other sort.”
school ?” The youngster shook his head vigorously.
“No, in England, sir.” In old and more leisurely
times, a Judge—if it were apparent that the ignorance
arose from neglect and was not due to extreme
youth—would adjourn the ease to permit of the
child receiving instruction as to the nature of an
oath and having his religious education furbished
up. There is no age limit. Any child at any age
may give evidence. He becomes incompetent only
if shown to be of such “tender years” that he has
not sufficient intelligence to testify cr has not a
proper appreciation of truthful speaking. In an
ancient case a child of eight years was duly sworn,
but that being ..a ~,case in which an • unfortunate old
woman was charged with witchcraft, perhaps the
Judge thought a little testimony one way or the
other wouldn’t matter. There was such a strong
public sentiment on the subject of witches that you
could back the .finding of the jury with absolute
certainty.

“Smike” : I gather that to give all-round
satisfaction the Melbourne War Memorial
must be a cross between a pyramid, a tower
and a pagoda, built on a spherical, octagonal
base with seven elliptical corners, and sug-
gesting the architectural styles of Greece,
Carthage, Moscow and Siam in its columns,
fountains and other outworks. It should
also represent the sentiment of war, the
spirit of peace, dignified mourning with a
dash of glory, and typify that restless repose
that has made us Australians what we are
to be. In order to gratify the utilitarians,
who want it to do something towards its
keep, it should have a basement divided into
a shine-parlor, a casualty ward, a creche
and an ice-cream kior-k. All available niches
might be occupied by busts of Lloyd George
and other war-winners, and the evening press
should lend some of its seaside beauties to
pose as Charity, Justice. Love and Sacrifice.
Other aesthetic ideas will no doubt be pro-
posed and adopted as time goes on. and
inevitably room must be made for Melba’s
carillon of bells. But the greatest trouble
will be finding something suitable to crown
the mass. Whether it should be a kooka-
burra picking out the eye of a decayed eagle,
or Hughes as a statue of Liberty with an
eternal light in his brow, one cannot say
for the present. Personally. I favor Hughes.
He -would add to the daring simplicity of
the whole conception.
“H.E.R.”: To a lady friend the fond
mother recited the virtues of her young
hopeful, who was busy turning the water-tap
on and off. “I- believe Jimmy will be an
engineer,” she said: “he can’t see a tap hut
he must turn it on.” Jimmy’s juvenile
traits were certainly indicative —he is now
the best barman in Westralia.
“G.R.”: Both Canada and the United
States are becoming exercised about the ulti-
mate ownership of certain lands which may
be found in the unexplored Beaufort Sea,
between Alaska and the North Pole. The
Canadian Government is despatching the
steamer Franklin to try to ascertain it there
is anv available terra firm a worth bagging,
and Uncle Sam projects an expedition in
two or three
months’ time with
the giant airship
Shenandoah, _ half
a dozen ’planes
and a depot ship.
Norway is also in
the field ; Captain
Amundsen, in addi-
tion to sending
Nansen’s old Fram
drifting across the
Pole, will make a
second attempt to
fly from Spitzber-
gen to Alaska.
Meantime Britain,
U.S.A. and Russia
all claim Wrangell
Island, on the
north coast of
Siberia. This deso-
late spot is on the
Polar air-route
across the Top of
the World, which
is much shorter
than any other
route around the
globe. Stefansson,
the Canadian ex-
plorer, is so con-
vinced of its ulti-
mate value as an
aerodrome that he
i s touring the
Empire to get
people interested,
and will shortly
arrive in Austra-
lia. Recently Bri-
tain has been do-
ing a little quiet
annexation in the
South Polar re-
gio n s, having
handed over the
Ross Dependency
to Maoriland. It
includes the Ross
Sea, where M.L. is consequently getting a
royalty on every barrel of whale-oil won by
Norwegians.

“Howitzer”: I know of one Digger who
discovered his double under embarrassing
circumstances. He was on Blighty leave,
and after a hectic time regained his senses
on a comfortable bed in a nice room. He
was trying to solve the mystery when a
woman with two kiddies entered and begged
of him to rest a bit longer. Then to his
amazement she instructed one of the nip-
pers to run around to the pub and get daddy
a bottle. He started to wake up then. The
woman was quite satisfied, apparently, that
he was her husband, who had gone to Aus-
tralia three years previously and vanished.
HE JUST KICKED.
“Did Archie go down on his knees when he
asked you for my hand, papa?”
“I didn't notice where he lobbed.”
All liis eloquence failed to shake her con-
viction, so he suggested that she should accom-
pany him to headquarters, where he could
prove his identity. The strangest part of
the story is the sequel. On their way to
Horseferry-road headquarters the real hus-
band -was accidentally encountered amongst
a crowd of furlough Diggers who w T ere
awaiting their passes in the big court-
yard. After a second of doubt, the woman
claimed No. 2 as the right party. No. 2
didn’t deny anything, and seemed rather
pleased than othei’wise at the reunion.

THE NEWEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This moment all the smartest folk
Must dance the new step, Lizard Wiggle;
So pretty elbows thrust and poke,
So pretty shoulders writhe and wriggle.
Our trousered partners twisting squirm
In abandon post-Victorian,
Owning man is but a worm,
Or at best some kind of saurian.
’Tis one more name —a good name, too—
To gather in the curious hoard
Culled all haphazard from the Zoo
And from the casualty ward:
The Lame Duck and the Camel Walk,
The Dawdle and the Conger Curl,
The Stagger, Toddle, Ostrich Stalk,
The Hesitation and the Swirl.
The Bunny Hug has passed away ;
The Fox was out when nights were murky;
The Turkey Trot has had its day;
The Fox has gobbled up the Turkey.
Now even the Fox trots jealously
Before the Lizard Wiggle flying,
As all old fogeys grieve to see —
“Oh, for the good old Waltz !” they’re sighing.
But Waltz and Polka and Quadrille
Were “gamesome chits” that in their prime
Made W. Henley feel quite ill
Until he wrote a prayer in rhyme:
“Muse of the many-twinkling hose,
Terpsichore, 0 teach your pets
The charm that shines, the grace that glows
In Gigues, Gavottes and Minuets t”
Still gran’s great-gran, with powdered hair,
Upon the dowager’s sofa sitting,
Once watched with unadmiring stare
The youngsters Minuet-wise flitting.
“How bold of foot and bold of face
They sweep all etiquette before ’em!
Give me the Galliard’s sober grace,
The stately Saraband’s decorum !
“The Pavan, now, was soft and sad,
A measure fit for decent days,
When men and maids had not gone mad
To follow up the latest craze.
In saucy Gigues they jerk like frogs,
Or ape-like caper hand in hand—-
The country’s going to the dogs
Since no one treads a Saraband.”
Yet old men said the Pavan grave
Was copied from a peacock’s prancing.
Galliard or Sarabands —saints save
Its devotees from critics’ glancing!
HE STILL OBSERVES ONE RULE.
“I hear Jim has lost all his good manners since he married Marie.”
“Not quite all of them. F’rinst ance, he still always leaves the
table feeling that he could eat a bit more.”
For when, in time of ruffs and swords,
The Earl of Essex led the revel,
’Twas dubbed—so written word records—
“A dance invented by the Devil.”
When David danced before the ark
Be sure that greybeards in the crowd
New-fangled steps were quick to mark,
And screwed their noses, muttering loud
The ancient Hebrew for “Bad egg!”
With other epithets amiss—
“ Maybe he turns a nimble leg ;
His father never danced like this!”
So little molehills of young fun ,
Sour age finds mountains for removal;
There’s nothing new beneath the sun
Save old eternal Disapproval.
Thus, under time’s sardonic laws,
Staid cat to offspring cuffed and bitten:
“I’ll teach you to control j our paws!
Not thus I played when I was kitten!”
No doubt when cave-men gave a ball
Their pride was to be “latest cry.”
An ex-bear’s den their supper hall,
Where juicy meat was red and high;
And there was marrow in the bones
For all the Most Exclusive—but
“Just watch that girl!” hissed chaperons,
“See where she has her wolf-skin cut!
“Observe her knees and arms outflung!
This new step is a scandalous matter.
We danced not so when I was young
In good old days.” So ran the chatter
That drove the damsel’s parent wild
Until he threatened: “Something big’ll
Hit you over the head, my child,
If you don’t drop that Lizard Wiggle!”

“Business”: “Ingomar’s” par. (B.
24/1/24) reminds me of another music mer-
chant who came off on top. A piano was
delivered under the instalment plan. Pay-
ments fell into arrear, and the firm in-
structed its solicitors to take the usual steps
to recover the instrument. A zealous
articled clerk, seething with newly-acquired
knowledge, was sent to the house, and, after
gaining admittance incog., lie let in two
hefty carriers to remove the goods. Just
as they were setting to work the landlord’s
agent arrived. He had a judgment for
unpaid rent, and was in search of valuables
upon which to distrain. One of the first
things he cast covetous eyes on was the
piano. The clerk thought quickly. The
thing was certainly seizable until he got
it off the premises ; but articles actually in
use are exempt from distress. He there-
fore cut short the argument by starting up
“Bananas” over the keys. And while he
played, his henchmen slowly carried off the
instrument.

Les Robinson’s Fable of the Humorist
and the Sad Man:—
One day a professional humorist accosted a sad
man who was whiling away time by weeping copi-
ously.
After scalding the humorist’s palm with a half-
ounce tear, the sad man commenced to lapse into
still further paroxysms of tearfulness ; but the humor-
ist stopped him by dropping a handful of road metal
down the back of his neck.
When he had thanked him for his interference,
and had finished commenting on the curious kinds of
blanky weather they were having, the sad man mis-
took it for his duty to inform the humorist, with
every sign of enthusiasm, that he had that morning
married a widow, crippled, penniless and the mother
of a large family of young children.
“This banquet of luck, my friend,” said the sad
man with a lugubrious endeavor to seem cheerful,
“has overwhelmed me, as you see. We had a splen-
did honeymoon at the ninepenny pictures. '
“Your weekly wage, bonehead, is still the irredu-
cible minimum, is it not?” inquired the humorist.
“Things are much too good to last,” said the sad
man, funereally joyful. “The minimum has not
been reduced for several weeks.”
Without waiting to hear any more, or to ask ior
permission, the humorist stripped off the sad man’s
mournful attire and donned it himself, dressing the
sad man in his own fantastic apparel. Then, assuming
a melancholy expression, he said: “My unique friend,
up till now I believed myself a humorist, but it
has flashed upon me that, compared with you, I do
not know my trade. You are the humorist and I
am but a sad mistake, after all.”
“Phthisis” : One of the reasons why T.B.s
will not enter a State institution was illus-
trated last week when the patients at Water-
fall (N.S.W.) went on strike against the food.
At all these places the contract for supplies
goes to the lowest tenderer., It follows that
foodstuffs, while wholesome enough, are the
cheapest offered; they are cooked in large
quantities and served in the plainest way.
Yet t.b.’s, from the very nature of the dis-
ease, have poor appetites and weak diges-
tions ; they require dainty and appetising
dishes if they are to eat sufficient to fortify
HE KNEW WHO THE SECOND ONE WAS.
THE FORTUNE-TELLER: “You are married. I see the lady’s
husband. He is a poor, weak, conceited thing, almost an
imbecile. Now, I see her married again. He is handsome,
noble, magnificent.”
THE CLIENT: “But stop, stop! My wife never told me she was
a widow!”
themselves against their ailment. In fact,
to give them a chance of recovering they
must have better and more varied food than
healthy people. Only a private sanatorium
will supply this, and, apart from the charges,
such places are hard to find. The one licensed
private establishment on the Blue Moun-
tains (N.S.W.) lately more than doubled its
accommodation by taking in a former Red'
Cross home next door. Every bed was occu-
pied in a week.
“Wingy”: “777” (B. 17/l/’24) says that
the unique honor with which the French
buried Baron von Richtofen, the German
Ace, was in marked contrast to the Huns’
tribute to those superb airmen, Guynemer
and Ball, both of whom, he adds, were
brought down in No Man’s Land by enemy
fire so destructive that it left 110 trace of
either man or machine. May I place it on
NOTHING IF NOT OBLIGING.
CLAUIUS: “Sir, I love your daughter; I cannot live without her.”
M ONEYBAGS: “Which one?”
C LAUDIUS: “Really, old top, I’ll leave that to you.”
record that, with regard to Guynemer, anyhow,
this statement is at variance with the account
of the burial of one of France’s most famous
flying men published in the Little Paper,
which was issued as a supplement to MY
Magazine? According to this authority, the
Germans gave Guynemer quite as notable a
funeral as the French gave Von Richtofen.
What is more, they sent an invitation to the
French aviation corps to come and assist,
guaranteeing them complete security and
absolute liberty of passage for the purpose,
with the result that 15 French aviators tra-
versed the enemy lines and were present at
the interment. After the ceremony they
found their machines had been refilled with
petrol and prepared for the return journey.
“Ex-Dig.”: Some war-time problems
apparently still remain unsolved. The other
day a Sydney
magistrate had be-
fore him two ex-
Diggers who had
been fighting in
George-street. The
original argument,
it was elicited in
evidence, began
over the proper
pronunciation of
“Ypres.” In France
the Diggers and
Tommies called it
all sorts of things,
from “Ipps” to
“Vipers.” I once
endeavored to find
out what French
people call it from
the lady of an
estaminet, but all
I could get from
her was a “Oui,
M’sieur” to every-
thing I suggested.
“Well, then, is it
‘Mulligatawny’?” I
asked at last. “It
is whatever M’sieur
pleases,” she de-
clared politely. It
struck me even
then that if people
on the spot were
prepared to be
so tolerant, there
was no need for Diggers to quarrel about it.
“0.K.”: A message to the effect that the
town coxmcillors of Macclesfield (Eng.) have
decided by 16 votes to 4 to open their meet-
ings with prayer reminds me. In my hot
rebellious youth I had something to do with
Macclesfield silk weavers, who mostly pro-
fessed their piety in a broad Cheshire sing-
song. One of these rugged producers of silk
was having his attention drawn to the num-
her of blemishes in a piece of his goods. Then
the Macclesfield man gazed reprovingly at
his admonisher, saying, “Nothing on this
earth is pur-fect. We sure not pur-fect, and
we are God’s harndi-worlk.”
* * * #•
“A.L.”: “Cartot” (B. 7/2/’24) contends
that there is evidence to show (1) that
malaria is not indigenous to New Guinea
and tlie Bismarck
Archipelago. and
(2) that it has
not existed very
long in those parts,
otherwise the
natives would
have become im-
mune, instead of
being more suscep-
tible to the disease
than whites, I
don’t know where
to find such evi-
dence. Although
the calentures and
other strange ills
suffered by voyag-
ers, and referred
to by Hakluyt.
Pnrchas and
others, are never
specifically named,
malaria must have
fou n d a place
amongst them; I
cannot conceive of
anyone doubting it
who has a know-
ledge of the treat-
ment of the dis-
ease. With regard
to “C artot’ s”
assertion about the
sufferings of
natives from
malaria, I can
only say that for
four years I was
in charge of native
hospitals in New
Guinea. There
were sometimes
more than 300
patients under my
care, but I seldom
saw a case of
mtllaria, and never one that required more
than a couple of days’ treatment.
“Ivip”: Like “Tarago” (B. 7/2/’24) I can
recall a German whose hatred of us lasted
as long as life itself. After a strenuous hop-
over at Passchendaele we were consolidating
our position during that period of quiet
which precedes a counter-attack, when the
loud moaning of a wounded Hun lying in a
shell-hole close by became unendurable, and
I left the trench with a tot of rum for the
sufferer. On reaching the shell-hole I saw
from the jagged wound in his chest that the
huge, bullet-headed feldwebel was pretty far
gone. Indicating my friendly intention, I
knelt down beside him. His eyes lit up with
a look of hatred that is scorched in my brain.
Gasping out curses he flung out his arms
wildly , and sought to grapple me with his
bloody hands. But his efforts had cost him
all his remaining strength, and he fell back
dead against the wall of the shell-hole.
“Te Pana”: Varying environment is mak-
ing it impossible to believe that the Maori
is one Maori. In the Hawkes Bay district,
where he is the big landlord, he is develop-
ing into a lazy, T.8.-ridden w’eakling, with
billiards, flash clothes and motor-cars tak-
ing the place of the old tribal gods. In
Urewera, Poverty Bay and the King Coun-
try, bushwhacking is keeping him thriving
and healthy. At Rotorua and Taupo the
tourist business has killed any idea of work
in him, and in these parts he has degener-
ated into a professional cadger. It has been
left to a remnant of the Ngapuhi tribe in
the far north of Auckland to preserve the
best of the racial characteristics. The
country is practically bare of everything
but kauri gum, and as it is necessary to dig
like the devil to get it, the people keep
themselves fit. They are mostly silent and
self-respectful and deeply religious; and it
is not likely that intercourse with the
pakeha will affect their simple mode of liv-
ing for years to come. Unless some unsus-
pected disaster happens, they can be backed
to outlive any other Maori tribe.
“8.V.E.” : Germans weren’t the only ones
occasionally found refusing to forgive their
enemies with their latest breath. Just be-
fore we bumped the Iluns out of Bretonneux
we came on a Digger who seemed to be try-
ing to bite a lump out of a black pineapple.
As we got closer he staggered to his feet,
swung his arm in- a half-circle, and launched
a Mills bomb, out of which he had been pull-
ing the pin with his teeth. It fell in a shell-
hole, and -we buried four victims later on.
The Digger had his left arm shattered at
the elbow, and three holes in his back; he
only lived long enough to tell us the “cows
surrendered, but plugged me w T hen I was
off my guard.”
“O.P.II.”: When put up to propose the
toast of “The Press” at a dinner to Helen
Jerome 20 years ago, Alfred Deakin in a
burst of confidence expressed his dread of
“those dangerous reporters who detect the
real answer behind the evasive one which
responsible Ministers find it necessary to
give occasionally.” Perhaps one of this
“dangerous” type was doing the Vie. Supreme
Court when Justice Weigall was made to say
that he was “amazed” at the time a. will
case w T as taking. Next day ’S’onor said lie
had used the word “dismayed,” which was
“entirely different,” and conveyed no sugges-
tion of reproach. When taken to task tor
referring to the “luminous pages of Gibbon,”
Brinsley Sheridan, with a twinkle, whispered
that “voluminous” was the word intended,
but that the “vo” must have got strangled.
Both of these cases suggest that there is
much to be said for Duncan Gillies’s
advice to colleagues: “Whatever you do don’t
explain.”
“Coot’’: Victoria’s oldest ecclesiastical
building is Christ Church, Geelong, built 80
years ago. During some recent repairs to
the tower, a 70-year-old deed of grant was
discovered, under which the then Governor
of N. S. Wales (Sir Charles Fitzroy) con-
veyed to Nicholas Alexander Fenwick,
Edward Brown Addis, William Roadknight,
Frederick Champion and Charles Sladen the
allotment on which the building is erected.
The consideration was that they paid a
farthing a year, if demanded. The parch-
ment is almost as good as new.

“F.A.” on some signboards at the war:—
Half-way up the first big sap dug on.Anzac, there
used to be a notice written in blue crayon on a piece
of packing case. The spot, in Monash Gully, was a
favored objective for Jacky’s snipers, and the sign read:
“Duck your nut —by order of Fray Bentos.” Going
through Bapaume I saw a notice written in tar on
the wall of a shattered building setting forth in drip-
ping letters the approximate distance from a well-
advertised Sydney tea-shop. There .used to be a Hun
dump at a place called Sanger’s Circus, half-way
between Mametz and Le Saars, which presently came
into possession of the Tommies ; but the Hun notice
board remained and upon it a large paper pro-
clamation printed in Teuton. Alongside this was
written: “Diggers are strictly forbidden to discuss
the contents of this notice with anyone—Chinese
laborers excepted.” In a possie near Warlanc-ourt
there used to be a rectangular periscope jambed in
between sandbags and never moved. Just alongside
the eye aperture somebody had scrawled on a piece
of cardboard: “Continuous pictures from 6 a.m. to
6 p.m. Wonderful scenic views—No actors or
actresses.” Most Diggers will remember the un-

The old system of giving any vacant judge-
ship in S. Aus. to the Attorney-General of
the moment is now obsolete; and Barwcil’s
only hesitation over filling the seat of the
late Judge Gordon was between several
K.C.’s, all good. Probably one or two lead-
ers of the Bar declined the appointment,
which now falls to T. J. N. Napier, at 41.
He came from England at 16, with his
father. Dr. Leith Napier, was articled to
C. C. Kingston, practised with A. J. McLach-
lan (Kingston’s last partner), and in 1917
joined the firm of Glynn, Parsons and
McEwin. Since then John Baker (son of
R. C. Baker, the old-time politician) has
also joined the group, and Parsons has been
made a Judge.
The Farmers’ Union sees rare political
promise in Murray Bourchier, member tor
Goulburn Valley in the Vie. Assembly. Bour-
chier is one of the irreconcilables who object
to any alliance with the Lawson Cabinet,
and his voice will probably be heard in favor
of a separation at the conference in Bendigo.
A combative young man with a strong trench
face, he finished a long spell at the war as
a colonel, a C.M.G. and a D.S.O.
U.S.A., tired of spending vast sums on a
helicopter which wouldn’t rise, has consigned
the thing to a Museum and refused to have
anything more to do with the idea. Louis

cil of the N.S.W. Amateur Swimming
Association, who is to manage Austra-
lia's Olympic team in Paris.
learned his business, has advanced suffici-
ently with his machine to have it ready for
outdoor tests. Brennan, now in his 73rd
year, first won the confidence of the British
Government when he took to England the
torpedo which he built in a Yarra-side work-
shop. Then he came along with the gyro-
scopic monorail, and recently lie has intro-
duced the gyroscopic principle into the sta-
tionary and hovering helicopter with con-
siderable success. At the Admiralty the old
boy has a free hand. His great rival was
Hiram Maxim, who used to be as keen as
Brennan on the helicopter. At 84, however,
Hiram prefers to watch Louis.
McDonald, M.H.R., who has been a sick
man ever since he left the Speaker’s chair, is
off to England, hoping to find some-
thing to soothe his troubled nerves.
Another man in need of a trip is
McDonald’s old friend Jimmy Matthews.
A nervous complaint which has gone to his
legs has deprived the erstwhile champion of
the proletariat of a lot of his vigor, lie now
sits out a debate in which aforetime he would
have joined, and on the re-opening of Par-
liament next month will have a specially
made cushion at his back.
Rolf Boldrewood’s old estate at Preston
(Vic.) is being subdivided for suburban,
settlement. Instead of calling streets by the
names of town councillors and the like,
Authority in this case has labelled them with
the names of Australian writers. Hence
Preston is to have a Lawson-street, an
O’Dowd-street, a Dennis-street, a MeCrae-
street, and so forth.

State Parlia-
ment.
C. E. Mcrrett, President of Vic. Royal
Agricultural Society and head of the Liberal
Union, was farewelled the other day, as he is
going on a seven-months’ trip to Europe.
When the south-eastern province had a
chance to return him to the Dreary House
it didn’t, so lie has had to be content with
minor activities—if anything can really be
minor to private membership of the Uppah
Chambali. Mcrrett is a much better hand
at getting things done than talking about
them, and consequently doesn’t make a good
politician. He has the manner of an amiable
Kentucky colonel. And, by the same token,
he is a retired or reserve-force colonel, too.
Among those injured in a recent Sydney
motor smash was Jack Talbot, who had
the limelight full upon him during the sit-
tings of the N.S.W. Wheat Commission.
He got mixed up in business with George-
son. and, according to the evidence, scattered
lordly sums in a lordly manner. A popular
man with a husky voice, Talbot, once an
A.W.U. organiser, never entertained any
illusions about politics, his outlook upon life
being quite cynical: but a reputation for
sticking to his friends and a large capacity
for underground engineering gave him a hold
on the Labor movement, which he still re-
tains to some extent.
Ex-Treasurer McPherson is flitting abroad
again on private business next month. As a
Vic. general election will be held before he
can return, lie is consulting his supporters
as to the best thing to do about his seat—
whether to let them try to win it for him in
his absence (as they did in 1921) or let
Swinburne, the former holder, or somebody
else have it. Haw-Hawthorn’s Parliamen-
tary representatives are great trippers. This
will be McPherson’s fourth sea voyage since
he has been in the House; Merritt and
Edgar, the Uppah Chambali members, are
just back from expanding themselves in
Europe: and Bent had to rake England to
find Swinburne in order to offer him a port-
folio.
Mrs. James Benson, for whom it was
claimed that she was the oldest mother of
a Digger, died at Adelong (N.S.W.) the
other day, in her 91st year. She hailed from
Ireland, and reached Adelong 70 years ago.
Although her three sons had long passed
their youth, one of them joined the first
contingent to leave the southern town, and
was supposed to have been killed; but he
turned up 18 months after the conclusion of
the war. He had been a prisoner, and was
forgotten in the early exchanges.
Technically Vic. Premier Lawson is a pub.
proprietor. The Colonial Mutual Life Co.,
of which he is a director, holds the freehold
of the Union Club Hotel in Melbourne. The
property was offered for sale the other day,
but the reserve w T as not reached.
Sam Barnes, who, as Minister for Rail-
ways in the first Lawson Ministry (1918-25),
carried through the negotiations and then the
legislation for the Riverina lines and border
bridges, sails next month for a glimpse of
Ms native Cornwall. If there is no redistri-
bution of Assembly scats he is safe for Wal-
lialla, but if new boundaries are fixed he
may have to do some canvassing.
The fierce light which beats upon a
church when it celebrates its centenary has
been throwing some rays upon Verger Lewis,
of St. James’s, Sydney. His grandmother
and grandfather were married there; so were
his wife’s three aunts. His father and his
uncle were baptised there, and his brother-
in-law7 is the grandson of the first verger.
A war-time echo was heard in Gilgandra
(N.S.W.) the other day, when A. H. Miller,
giving up his business interests in the town
with the intention of settling at Willoughby
(Sydney), w r as farewelled. It was Miller
who conceived the “March to Enlist" idea,
and was responsible for the route-march of
“the Coo-ees,” who started from Gilgandra
in 1915 and had become a small battalion
by the time Sydney was reached.
Binnawee, at Mudgee (N.S.W.), has
changed hands, George Stewart, the late
owner, selling to Dr. Laster. The
property, originally known as Green
Swamp, was a grant to Henry Cox,
son of William Cox, the man who built the
Great Western-road, in Macnuarie’s time.
It has remained in the family for three
generations; George Stewart, the late-owner,
married Fanny Eliza, a grand-daughter of
Henry Cox. On the property are fruit-
trees planted by the first settlers and still
bearing excellent fruit.
The job of Chief Officer of Health in
S.A., vacant by the retirement of Dr. Thomas
Borthwick, goes to Dr. Angas Johnson, who
lias been chairman of Adelaide City Council’s
Board of Health for about 14 years. John-
son is 50, took his degree in Melbourne at
the time of the Adelaide “hospital trouble”
30 years ago, and got experience later in
London, Germany and the Pasteur Institute
in Paris.
Three solid Conservative-Liberals—Camp-
bell McArthur, of Camperdown ; H. N. Beggs,
of Glentliompson; and M. Saltau, a former
Warrnambool merchant, are out for the
Western Province seat in the Vic. Uppah
Chambali, given up by Walter Manifold.
McArthur had a brief innings in the Assem-
bly (1900-02). Like Beggs, he is a
squatter. Saltau is chairman of the Chari-
ties Board, and may have some pull w’th
the householders in the big towns and with
such cockies as have bothered to get their
names on the roll.
“O.P.II.”: Faced with strong Labor oppo-
sition, Dave Smith, Liberal member for Ben-
digo West in Vic. Assembly, is not a certain
starter at next general election. He was
formerly a Laborite. and, as Hon. Minister
in the short-lived Elmslie Ministry (Decem-
ber, 1913), led the House while the no-con-
fjdetice motion, tabled by Willie Watt, was
being debated, as the salaried Labor Minis-
ters could not enter the House because at
that period they had to be re-elected as mem-
bers on taking office. Smith proved a sur-
prise packet, displaying unsuspected ability
and resource, and made Watt and his friends
feel that they had behaved like poor sports
in not waiting till Elmslie could get back
on the Treasury benches. Smith broke with
Labor a few years ago and won the Bendigo
West seat afresh, first as an Independent
Laborite and then as a Liberal. But dearer
to him than any political label is Cold Tea.
Some Impertinences from the Gallery:—
The most rapid speaker in the Speck’s Assembly is
Jim Hurst, Government whip. The most deliberate
is Franks, of the Cocky party. Hurst whip excited
goes off like several packets of crackers. Franks
chants liis sad dirge in unrelenting monotone. The
dandy is Eccles Snowden, though ex-Federal Minister
Jensen and ex-soldier Marriott also occasionally
exhibit flashes of passionate socks. Minister Belton
is the only man of the 30 who scorns a necktie.
He wears whiskers. Belton and Shoobridge (now
78) are the only two who don’t let their chins go
about naked. The best-behaved young man in debate
is Campbell, of the Cocky party. He is also one of
three who would have difficulty in winning a genuine
Ugly Man competition. Blind ex-sohlier Marriott
and George Becker are the others. Franks, Hobbs
and Cleary belong to the Purely Picturesque class
—a class which in' hides the Disraeli-visaged Piggott,
and of which the silver-crowned O’Keefe is the < hi-'f-
tain. The cleverest all-round man is Premier Lyons.
He is brilliant in debate and keen at the Committee
table. Attorney-General Ogilvie, the only lawyer
in the Assembly, also shows great ability, but, so
far, has not succeeded in impressing onlookers with
the notion that he is really earnest. But he is
young yet, and certainly looks like a potential
weight-carrier in politics. The biggest man, physi-
cally, is Jensen; the smallest (since Speaker Evans
is apparently growing) is ex-Premier Lee. The
latter is the most frequent speaker on the Opposition
side; he was so long Premier that he probably finds
it hard to realise that he is now at liberty to rest
his free-swinging jaw. The baldest member —an
honor that former-Speaker Woods wore as a shining
halo for more than a decade—is now Blyth, of
Wilmot. The shrewdest political engineer, outside
Ministers, is the veteran Alex. Hean, with Speaker
Kvans running close on his quarter and Alex. Marshall.
SEYMOUR HICKS , actor, and author of 56
plays and several hooks, arrives in Mel-
bourne from London.
Chairman of Committees, not far behind. Marshall
is perhaps the best-read man. The best business men
on view seem to be Opposition-leader Newton,
Labor-man Sheridan, Grant (of Murdoch and Co.),
ex-Mayor Snowden, and perhaps Jensen. The wealth-
iest are probably Jensen, Grant, Hobbs, Snowden and
Ogilvie, though this is, a matter diffic ult to judge
accurately from the Press Gallery. The quaintest
speaker and most amusing (and best liked) of the
30 is farmer-member Peter Murdoch.
The new secretary to S. A. Law Society—
C A. Edmunds having resigned after 10
years of it —is G. S. Reed, a Digger, who was
associate to the C.«T. and latterly junior part-
ner in the law firm of McLaclilan and Reed.
W. A. B. Greaves, referred to recently
as a 95-year-old officer of the N.S.W. His-
torical Society, has other activities still. He
has been a steward of the R.A.S. in the cattle
section for most of a century, and was once
more re-elected this year, the Society con-
sidering that he is far too young to retire yet.
William Ferguson Massey has been plas-
tered with more names by the irreverent
multitude than any other Australasian poli-
■ tician. In his earlier political days he was
“Farmer Bill" ; just before coming into office
in 1912 he was “Stonewall" : a few months
after lie carried his no-confidence vote the
people hailed him as “Big Bill"; as the
years passed he was “Old Bill." In the
Auckland province lie was “Pukekolie,”
which gave way to “Pukewilliani." To-day
he is either just plain “Bill" or “Bluff Bill."
Sydney Olivier, one of the three new Labor
peers, was a pioneer of Socialism in England.
He was one of the inner group of the Fabian
Society in its early days, the others being
Bernard Shaw 7 , Sidney \Vebb. Hubert Bland
and Annie Besant; lie contributed to the
“Fabian Essays,” and was secretary of the
society for four years (1886-90), Olivier
was a Bohemian in those days, but he
steadied down as he rose to the top of the
civil service, eventually becoming Governor
of Jamaica. He has written much in prose
and a little in verse, his best in the latter
line being “To a Revolutionary Poet,” in-
cluded in H. S. Salt’s anthology. “Songs of
Freedom." Both Webb and Olivier are still
close friends of Bernard Shaw 7.
From an old “roundsman”: —
Passing the late Tom Bent’s house the other
day I could not help contrasting his status from lie
inkslinger’s point of view with that of the present
Vic. Premier. When Bent was laid up with his
second-last serious illness, a team of reporters went
down to see him every day. It was a great break
in the monotony for Tummas, and he interviewed the
news-hunters much more than they skimmed him,
though in the end he generally gave them something
that set people chattering. Once, inspired by Under-
Treasurer Minogue, he suggested a naval programme
that made the hesitating Federal Government of the
day fairly mad because it had to follow on lie
lines he sketched. I can’t imagine Lawson being
either thus sought or, if sought, making the call
worth whue, m similar circumstances.
THE CAPTAIN’S LOVE-WHISPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In the Sydney Sun ‘Cremornite’ complains that
the captains of boats who have made their homes in
his suburb announce the return of their vessels by
‘a loud and long blast of welcome, lasting well nigh
from Bradley’s to Pinchgut. This is a signal 1o
their home-folks, and a sign of affection particularly
meritorious in seamen, but extremely annoying to the
residents.’ ”
When the skipper, home returning,
Love within his bosom burning,
Sees his home-lamp blink its greeting from the hill,
Ev’ry whistle he sets tooting
Till the uproar of their hooting
All the deepest nooks of silence seem to fill.
Not an echo in the subbub
But awakes to help the hubbub ;
Ev’ry house dog barks an answer to the din,
While each rooster, rising proudly,
To the challenge answers loudly,
And a thousand sleepers help with words of sin.
You may learn to really like it,
If you live just where you strike it,
And you’ll gently think, when Bedlam kills your
rest,
“ ’Tis a sea-bird home returning,
Love within his bosom burning.
Passing up a tender whisper to his nest.'

ABORIGINALITES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES - LINSEED OIL
“F.A.” : Talk of equestrian acrobatics (B.
31/l/’24) reminds me of an incident I saw in the
railway yards at Alexandria in December, 1914.
Men were busy discharging G.S. waggons of equip-
ment into railway trucks, when two horses attached
to a Tommy vehicle took fright and started cn a
mad gallop through the yards. Half a dozen troopers
of the First Australian Light Horse were despatching
stuff to Cairo from a waggon which stood in the
path of the runaways. There was only one man on
the A.I.F. vehicle, and he was on top of the load.
The other Diggers, noticing the bolt, shouted to the
occupant of the waggon to hop it. The advice was
accepted, hut not in the way intended; for as the
runaways approached, the frightened prads swerved
just enough to clear the standing waggon, and the
Digger took a flying leap from the top of the load
on to the back of the near-sider, and in 20 yards
had the pair on their haunches. This horseman was
no stunt rider from a buckjumping show. He was
a teat-puller from the Shoalhaven (N.S.W.).
“Tauwarra”: I met a Hanuabada (Port
Moresby) nig. the other day resplendent in the
yellow-braided blue-serge uniform of the medical-
officer’s staff. He gravely informed me that he was
"boy b’long dog-eater” now.
* * * *
“Fisho”: If “Jesmond” (B. 31/l/’24)
had to earn his living at fishing he would do it
in any wind. The general opinion that there are
no bites when an easterly wind is blowing is just
as ridiculous as the
superstition that fish
caught in moon-
light go bad. I
catch fish in all winds
and weathers, daylight,
starlight anl moon-
light. On January 30,
with an easterly blow-
ing all day and evening,
I hooked 45 whiting
and 701 b. weight of
snapper; and on Feb-
ruary 1, with an
easteily blowing all
day, 1 caught 60 whit-
ing and 901 b. of snapper
(one 241 b.). I would
have had a better haul
on the latter occasion
but for a terrific blow
from the east about
8.30 p.m., which
forced me to up anchor
and get for my life.
Incidentally, last week
my cheque for fish was
£l6 10s., and that for
the week before £l5
10s. They would have
been much more but
for the sharks (water),
who compel us to shift
all the time from
place to place. If
“Jesmond” would like
to test the veracity of
these statements, he
can meet me in any
wind about a mile and
a half south-east of
the South Channel
Light, Port Phillip
Bay. Identification
marks: White 18-
footer ; red nose and
florid face, with mut-
ton-chop whiskers.
“The Rumpus”.: For long-distance coo-ees
I’ll place my singlet on that of an old Binghi in
tne nor’-west of W.A. Between Ashburton Downs
station and the Top Camp (now deserted), on the
Ashburton River, is a table-top hill alongside which
the road runs. I was prospecting fully five miles
from the track while I waited for the station wag-
gonette, and for a plug of tobacco the old buck
promised to let me know of the vehicle’s arrival
in good time, which he did. Over the five miles
I distinctly heard his cry from the roof of the big
hill. It was not the usual coo-ee of a native, hut a
far more piercing noise-arrow.
“Jimmy Possum”: Waybackers now and
again show a certain amount of originality in
giving travellers and thoughtless neighbors a hint.
F’rinstance, a cocky in Bananaland, tired of pump-

ing water for all and sundry, had the following
posted up at his watering-trough:—
To Straying Wayfarers and Others.
To water your horse
You’re welcome of course,
And drink till it gives you a pain;
But don’t forget this,
Whether Mr. or Miss,
To pump the trough full up again.
My kiddies are tough—
They’re made of good stuff —
But work quite enough they’ve to do
Without pumping for strays
That come from all ways
And thoughtless damn blighters like you.
Cocky now grins as he watches from the comfort of
his verandah-chair the “thoughtless damn blighters"
dismount from their horses or vehicles, and, after
a glance towards the house, fill the trough to over-
flowing.

Some birth-rate boosters
“Spadger”: “Howitzer” (B. 17/l/’24) doesn’t
know much of swallow lore if he is surprised at
a pair rearing twn batches of youngsters in three
months. My swallows invariably bring up three
families, and if anything happens to the eggs or
young birds the parents build and produce more eggs
—I have known them do it as many as five times.
Usually there is a complete spring-cleaning when the
fledgling's are old enough to look after themselves;
the n?st is re-lined and patched with new mud on
the outside till it is as good as ever. At time of
writing there’s a queer sight to be seen in my
laundry every evening. A. pair built a nest on the
lintel above the door, and in it sits the mother bird
cn her third lot of eggs, while six youngsters —the
cats got two of the first hatching—nestle close to-
gether on the wood beside her.
“L.S.C.”: I don’t know about swallows, but last
year a pair of willie-wagtails built their home in
our shed at about the end of August, and three
eggs were laid. Only two young ones came out.
After about two weeks, apparently disgusted with
their first attempt, they decided to try again, and
three more eggs were laid. This time they hatched
and reared three young ones. Seemingly they were
pleased with their success, for another batch was
laid and three more young were reared —a total
of eight young from nine eggs, which isn’t a bad
performance. Next season 1 m going to enter the
busy little hen in the egg-laying competition.
“Pantagruel”: Another instance of fish
from the clouds happened at Loekrose (Q. ) just
recently. After a heavy rainstorm, a high ridge
was found to be shimmering with fish of all sizes up
to 3 sin. in length. They were alive, and some were
swimming about quite energetically in the pools -
left by the rain. The storm apparently kept within
narrow limits, as the paddock in which the fish were
found received 4-Jin., while not more than a mile
away only 50 points fell. Some children gathered
two kerosene-tins full of the fish and placed them
in a dam in an adjacent paddock, where they are now
apparently doing well.
“Dr. Nil” : Most people call it “cray” fish,
but it should properly be “craw.” “Craw” means
“crop,” and the crustacean in question has a “craw”
or crop in which it grinds its dinner.
“Golub” : “Cardinal’s” lately promul-
gated idea that his piglets died through imbibing
venom with the milk of the sow after she had been
bitten by a snake is out of the question, because a
full-grown pig is protected over the whole of its body
by a thick layer, of non-vascular fat, through which
snake-venom could not find its way into the blood-
stream. Moreover, if venom had got as far as the
blood, it would most likely have killed the sow. For
the same reason the suggestion that the young pigs
were starved to death through snake-venom causing
the sow’s mammary glands to stop secreting is also
ruled out. It does not follow that the presence of
the snake in the pen had anything to do with either
the sow’s sickness or the, demise of the family—-
both might have been due to some other cause alto-
gether. There is an idea prevalent in the bush
that adult pigs have a physiological immunity to
snake-venom; but research has shown that there is
nothing in this. The only protection the pig has
is that thick fat-layer; and this, all things con-
sidered, is efficient enough.
“Amapu”: Re bad “breaking” being re-
sponsible for buclcjumpers. The best horse-breaker
ever in this part of the world (M.L.) was a German
named Lichtwark. He wrote a book called “Educat-
ing the Young Horse,” which ever}' breaker should
read. He declared that no horse is naturally vicious,
and held that if a prad is prevented from buck-
ing while being broken in it will never buck after-
wards. Lichtwark invented a system of tackle oy
means of which he got one hind leg off the ground
• —tied to another rope round the animal’s neck.
In such a position a horse is helpless. Jump on
him, saddle him, bang .tins round him, dust him
with a piece of canvas —do anything you like.
Repeat the dose a few times, and the horse will
then be as quiet on four legs as he was on three.
Lichtwark spent most of his time in Maoriland, but
he made one or two trips to Australia, where he
taciued and cured by his system some pretty hard
cases in the buckjumping line.
“Ah Poo”: Fencing-wire has long been
known as the cockies’ friend, but a Nathalia (Vic.)
farmer has found a use for it unheard of before. He
was bitten on the leg by a snake, whereupon his
mate tied a ligature of fencing-wire round the affected
leg, and hurried him to the doctor. He was nearly
asleep on arrival, but is all right now.

“Pat Bushie” : I know nothing about the
fruitfulness of swallows (B. 17/l/’24), but surely
this is a fowlyard record. On 10/10/’23 a muscovy
duck of mine hatched her first clutch of ducklings.
SUCH A GENEROUS OLD
GENTLEMAN.
MR. WOOP WOOP ( returning in a hurry
from the street): “Heigh, missy! You
didn’t ’appen to find a couple uv fivers
under me piller, did yer?”
HOUSEMAID: “Oh, yessir, thank you) sir.
An’ I ’ope yer bed waz comfortable,
sir."
Three days later she started laying again. On
Boxing Day 12 young ducklings arrived from a
setting of 13 eggs, and 10 are still doing well.
The lady has left the youngsters and is moulting
now, so there won’t be a “hat trick.”
AFTER THE SPREE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the shearing cheque is finished and the publi-
can goes crook,
All the friends we had diminished, till the last one
takes his hook,
Then we grin—what good in sighing!—and the
swag’s upon our back ;
Though at times wc think we’re dying, there is no
cure like the track.
Yes, we spend our hard-earned money—we’re a mil-
lionaire a day—-
And the girls with lips of honey in our arms a
moment stay.
But the busliman’s not a shirker —that’s a game for
city curs—
There is room here for a worker; so we take cn
cutting burrs.
P’raps you landed on the river with intentions very
good ;
For that last spree made you shiver—too much
booze, too little food —
And you’ve sworn off all the drinking, mean to eat
this last cheque out.
But a thirst along comes slinking—yes, you’re on
another bout,
And you call Tom, Dick and Harry to the bar where
you are king;
But the money will not tarry—up again the swag
you sling.
For you cannot change your habits: when chequed
up you always fall ;
But there’s plenty dough in rabbits, and they’re
waiting for us all.
To the city you are tripping with a roll that bulges
out;
And you say you won’t be slipping, strangers shall
not hear you shout.
But the city is deceiving. You are footsore and so
dry;
SORTING THEM OUT.
“Ez it you or your little Loin sister that’s ’ome ill in bed, my dear?”
“My sister, of course."
“Note, ilia’s ’zackly what I thought, awnly you’re s’much alike
I wadden ’ardly sure.”
Just one drink and you’ll be leaving—to that roll
you say good-bye.
Yes, you’ll find it quickly dwindles, with the girls
and “heads” you meet,
When they work their little swindles and they throw
you in the street.
Though your head is feeling dizzy, to the bush your
fancies run;
For the blowfly’s getting busy and there’s crutching
to be done.
In a dreary spot you’re dwelling, waiting for the
coach to town ;
In the roadside pub they’re yelling, drinking mugs
of liquid brown.
And the publican just beckons, shouts one pot of
foaming beer;
When your score next day he reckons there’s another
cheque gone queer.
All those empty bottles foisted in your room while
you’re asleep
Mean that bluey must be hoisted. You are feeling
very cheap.
But you needn’t mind, old chappy; there is work
and work to spare.
Come and join a gang, be happy, you can start
in cutting pear !
So we won’t vote prohibition, though we’re some-
times on the square;
We’ve so often tried contrition, but at last we do
not care.
There is always some work waiting when we’ve
finished up a spree;
So it’s no use wowsers prating to the likes of you
and me.
In a drought we go scrub-lopping, fixing fences in a
flood ;
And there’s always briar-chopping, when your best
pub name is Muu.
While the brown, cool beer is brewing, past a pub
I’ll never slink—
Phew! The sun is hot and stewing! Come on in
anaveadrink !
N.s.w.

A boresome subject:—
“.Tarrah”: “Wink” asks (B. 10/l/’24) if snakes
can make gimlets of themselves. One dav in the
hills east of Manjunup (W.A.) I saw about one
toot of brown snake’s tail sticking out of some
gravel. \V atching it for a minute or two I noticed
a sinuous movement, and soon saw that the visible
portion of the tail was gradually growing less. At
the spot dirt and gravel had been washed into a
hole where a stump had been burnt out, and there
was about 3in. of loose gravel on the top. Dis-
mounting I tapped the wriggler with a stick, and
immediately it began to back-pedal with corybantic
gyrations. When it got right out there was no hole
to be seen. As the mouse-catcher was 3ft. long it
must have possessed the propensities of an auger
to screw itself 2ft. into that ground.
“Kagar”: A snake does not “build its nest.”
When it feels the want of a home it just takes the
nearest hole of suitable size it comes across. If
the place happens to be empty, all the better; if
occupied, well, the occupier doesn’t stop to argue,
but makes tracks via the back door and leaves the
usurper in possession. By the way, a snake seldom
takes up quarters in a hole that has no back door;
this may account for its preference for rats’ and
rabbits’ burrows. My attention was first drawn to
this tact by an old bush-hand who saw me standing
over a small hole down which T’d seen a wriggler
vanish. He called, “Look out behind yer,” and on
turning I discovered the business end of the snake
coming out from another hole, not 2ft. from where
I was standing.
“Spenner”: As the scales prevent backward motion,
it is impossible for a snake to dig its own hole.
For the same reason it’s a very hazardous proposi-
tion for him to poke his nose into one already dug.
If there isn’t sufficient room inside for him to turn
he is trapped. A couple of weeks ago there was a
great commotion among my fowls down at the hay-
stack. Upon investigation I discovered about 4ft.
of snake violently flogging the atmosphere. The
business end was down a mouse-hole. I mutilated
the visible portion, but failed in an attempt to
OLD SONGS RESUNG—“HAIL, SMILING MORN!"
“Whose rosy fingers ope the gates,” etc.
drag the reptile out. Upon digging it up I was
surprised to find only about 6in. underground. A
pile of loose earth separated the head from a mouse.
I wonder if a snake often makes such' a bloomer ?
“Jesmond”: If snakes do make gimlets of them-
selves, how do they close up the hole again? While
digging post-holes a few weeks ago, I unearthed
a 4ft. black snake. The nest was about 2ft. down,
out I could not find out how he got there. There
was certainly no opening to the surface. The ground
was black sand with a good sole of grass, so there
v °U* have been some surface indication if a burrow
had fallen in. On the face of it he must have been
there a long time, but he was far from being dopey,
tor he nearly put me in hospital.
KEEPING HIM AMUSED.
MRS. HAYSEED: “Where’s the new hand?”
MR. HAYSEED: “It’s his day orff, so I sent ’im inter town with a load of pumpkins.”
“Spenner” : Some of the great gums along
the Murray still bear' scars where Binghi in the ol<l
time removed the bark from an “elbow” for a
canoe. 1 can imagine the difficulties of getting the
bark off; but can any Abo. explain how the huge
sheet was brought 30ft. or 40ft. to the ground with-
out disaster ?
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: When sugar was milled
at Yeppoon (Q.) we found the surplus molasses a
great asset in dry seasons. My brother and I used
to cut down prickly-pear with a Kanaka’s cane-knil'e,
boil the stuff with water and a gallon or so o!
molasses, and feed our cattle. They never asked
what else was cn the menu. One night our pet
Strawberry smelt out the barrel,
which was kept under the house, and
managed to draw the plug. Our
house was built on a rise, and in
about half an hour the black ooze
came slowly down the hard earth
until a lake of it was available for
the kine. They wired in and finally
lay down in it. Next morning they
were patched and smeared all over
with the sticky stuff, which had picked
up and clung to every bit. of dry grass
and cow-dung that they had lain in;
and they were attended by millions of
flies. We drove the mob into the
Pacific and kept , them there until the
waves had washed them clean. For
a couple of days the cows ate nothing,
but their yield of milk was as rich
as Henry Ford, and their output as
prolific.
“Werrimee”: A notable mem-
ber of the Wooroowoolgcn (N.S.W.)
blacks was old Kyan, who had been
hamstrung in her giddy youth by a
revengeful husband, and had to get
about on hands and knees. She was
fond of fishing, and as she could not
go very far from camp, the other
blacks allowed her sole piscatorial
rights in the nearest stretch of river
water. One evening two white boys
were setting duck lines just below
the camp. Old Kyan crept on to
them, and tumbled them over a steep
bank into the river. When ah angry
parent remonstrated with her, she
said that little bit of river belonged
to her and they were poaching. An-
other evening she caught the boys
swimming there and threw clods and
sticks at them till they left. Again
interviewed, she said they were frightening her fish
away, and added: “Them pfeller got plenty good leg
to walkabout.”
* * * *
“8.V.E!.”; I can testify that the kingfish
is a lubricated streak of sea-lightning. While one
of Streeter’s pearling schooners was at anchor off
Beagle Bay in 1907, a kingfish leaped from the water
15 feet off the port side, amidship. It struck the
mainmast 17 feet above the deck, somersaulted on
to the hatchway, missing our Jap cook by a hair,
and then flipped itself over the rail. I agree w’ith
“Broome” (B. 10/l/’24) as to the kingy being
great eating. We used to catch them by simply
towing a No. 16 line with a frayed piece of canvas
attached to the hook. The trouble came when haul-
ing them in; as gallant fighters they’re in a class
of their own.
“Two Seas” : A Surry Hills pioneer tells
a yarn in a Sydney paper about a thief who hid his
plunder in the bark of a sapling, and, returning
some years later, had to climb 30ft. up the tree
to recover it. This explains why- surveyors have to
carry extension ladders when they require to verify
marks cut on trees at boundary corners by their
predecessors. In Gippsland, where the trees carry
things up at an abnormal speed, a man charged
with trespass pleaded that the board nailed to the
tree warning trespassers had reached such an alti-
tude that it couldn’t be read without the aid of
a good telescope. A city bloke once told Dad that
on Surry Hills one had to be careful about climbing
trees, as they grew so rapidly that they went up
faster than one could climb down, and boys had
only been saved from starving up a tree by ring-
barking the vegetable.
“Pulganbar”: “Pat Bushie’s” cocky who
transported to safety 800 marooned sheep in flood-
time (B. 24/l/’24) can’t beat a Woodfordleigh
(N.S.W.) cowman who, in the 1920 Clarence River
flood, had 17 poddies marooned on low-lying land.
The dogs were sent across to drive the young ’uns
through the shallow flood-waters, but the move was
unsuccessful, so Cocky stripped off and carried the
poddies, singly, on his shoulders. The only injury
sustained was a lacerated back caused by the kicks
he got. Each of the 17 trips was an exciting epi-
sode because of floating logs, etc., on which were
numerous reptiles. On one occasion a green snake
entwined itself arbund the cocky’s leg! I saw the
whole performance.
“H.L.N.”: I can’t raise much .enthusiasm
over “F. Clinton’s” suggestion (B. 24/l/’24) that
we should try to induce our so-called native fruits
to develop into something fit for table use. The
varieties that grow on poor and worthless soils,
such as the native cherry, geebung, five-corner and
groundberry, are so utterly contemptible as fruit
that “F.C.” might as well suggest an attempt to
improve the breed of rats up to the standard or
sucking-pig. In any case a practical difficulty exists
m the fact that the poor country flora resents any
attempt at cultivation. This njay be due to the
fact that its prolific flowering arises from Nature’s
attempt to forestall the immense waste that is bound
to occur when the seed falls on barren ground. Such
flora is best left to fulfil the purpose for which it : s
suited—to gratify the eye by draping our rocky hill-
slopes and rugged gullies. Considered as fruit I
pin my faith to pears and orchard cherries as against
super-geebungs or other improved aboriginil vege-
tables that “F. Clinton” might dream of evolving.
“Two Seas” : I agree with the man who
told “Lindesay” C B. 31/l/’24) that putting up 80
fencing posts is a good day’s work, and I’m not
surprised that he deserted his beer when “Lindesav”
mentioned a Westralian champion who put up 200
in a day—beer that can put up a record like that
is best left alone. I have £lOO, or anv part of it,
that says there is no man in Australia or elsewhere
who can put up, on his own, 200 posts that conform
with the usual specifications for fencing- and are
rammed firmly enough for the rabbits to scratch
themselves against. Incidentally, for the slow record
this will take some beating. Two men once took a
contract near Goulburn' (N.S.VV.) to put up posts
at 3d. each. For the first week they averaged 11 per
day. There was no second week, as the cocky
reckoned that he would have to replace the first
mile before the last mile was up.
“Truthful James”: Recently in the Kow-
mung River, near Yerranderie (N.S.W.), we harpooned
an eel 29in. in length. Its innards contained a 26in.
black snake. Within 50yds. of the spot we killed
a 34in. snake in the act of swallowing a 16in.
eel. During the disembowelling we left our kit, one
fox- and two rabbit-skins on the river-bank, and
on our return the skins had disappeared. Suspicion
rested on a corpulent goanna, which we shot and
operated upon. His inner shrine contained the miss-
ing skins, an enamelled mug 3in. in diameter, a
pocket-knife with corkscrew attached, and one No. 8
rubber boot. Joe Deacon, manager of the Wonga
mines, did the slaying and post-mortems. As soon
as the measurements were checked we cleared. The
neighborhood didn’t seem safe.
"Tamornie” : Suppose I shall be called a
liar for saying so; but still, in and around the
Talasea district headquarters, New Britain, the
jungle-fowl, instead of building mounds of rubbish
for the purpose of incubating their eggs, burrow
into banks in places where the ground is heated by
underground streams of hot water. About 25 miles
to the north is v "a crater, and so many fowls make
use of the warm ground in the vicinity that natives
travel long distances to collect the eggs from the
burrows.
“H.L.H.” : Walking along the creek-bank
the other day 1 came upon a green snake about
<>ft. long and outed him with the only weapon I
had a flat file. Noticing a pronounced bulge under
his waistcoat, I opened him up with the small end
of the file. The bulge was a frog, and as I turned
it over I ■ noticed it still lived. I cleaned it
a bit and then it sat up and wiped the slime
out of its eyes while getting its second wind. Pre-
sently it spied a pool close handy and left without
even thanking me. I’ll bet it’s the narrowest squeik
he ever had. One of his mates was a section lower
down; but it was no use trying first aid on him—
he was beyond recall.
“Te Kurri’s” little lecture:—
Many cases of cruelty to horses are due more to
ignorance and thoughtlessness than to a desire to
be cruel. A common example is that of bridles
being adjusted too tightly, sometimes, perhaps, having
been taken off the head of a smaller animal and
placed on that of one far bigger without any length-
ening of the check-straps, the result being that the
horse’s mouth is drawn upwards with the greatest
tension, and after an hour or two the pain must be
almost unendurable. The same thing applies to
throat-straps, which are often so tightened up as
to become literally what some people call them—
choke-straps. A frequent cause of misery to drav-
horses is the great weight which some ignorant or
Careless drivers cause the shatter to uphold with
■u S kkek while the dray is being loaded, owing to
the fact that the front part of the dray is loaded
first instead of the weight being distributed over
the vehicle. The use of propsticks under the shafts
would obviate this, but some drivers are too careless
or lazy to put. them down, and some drays are with-
out them. A man who carted the beer to our
local hotel always unloaded the back barrels without
displacing any from the front, so that often for a
few minutes five or six barrels, weighing’ perhaps
10cWt. or 12cwt., were left in the front. When this
was pointed out to him he said that as it was only
for a few minutes he had not bothered letting his
propsticks down or unloading some weight from the
front, forgetting that those were minutes of agony
to his horse. The worst case I have noted occurred

on the farm of a barbarian. He was driving three
good draughts in the binder, and when he pulled up
I noticed the flies swarming round the mouth of each
animal. Investigation showed large swellings through
which the bits were slowly cutting, which they
could not fail to do, being braced up as tight as a
girth on a buckjumper. I commenced to undo one
winker-strap to slacken it, but was ordered to leave
it alone, as the horses did not turn properly unless
the winkers were tight. 1 tried to convince the
Hun that he was wrong, but without avail. That
was two weeks ago, and the same team is still
working in the same way.
THE MAN IN THE MOON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There s an old, blind blaekfellow lives in the moon—
All by himself in the cold, white moon.
He’s grown so old that he needs no food,
So old that he’ll never die.
But by his wurly are still some spears ;
And faint, far sounds from the earth he hears
As the moon swims over the midnight ways.
He thinks again of his hunting days.
He cannot see how the waters gleam,
But he hears aloft the wood-duck scream,
He hears the plover cry.
He feels the wind of the stiff, black wings,
As down to the south the leader swings
And the great black swans go by.
' ivoolyn! Koolyn !” he hears them call,
“Koolyn! Koolyn!” rn> to another.
“How -.far is the water, sister? brother?”
And i.* thin, sad echoes fall.
“nuk-buk ! Buk-buk!” cries the little owl,
The ranges ring to a long, wild howl ;
And peeping out of a high tree-nook
The soft, bright eyes of Karamook—
Little, grey Karamook, nibbling leaves
Stare and stare at the blind old man
Sitting above in Meniyan—
White Meniyan, the moon.

FOUR-WAY FURNACE
WILTON PATENT FORCED-DRAUGHT FURNACE GRATE
that is guaranteed to give equal static pressure throughout the length
of grate. Can be installed in any type of boiler in a few hours.
Thirty-four Furnaces installed at Metropolitan Colliery Co.
15,000 working to-day throughout the World.
The Wilton patent forced-draught furnace is the latest and most up-
to-date practice for the economical and efficient burning of low-grade,
inferior fuels for the utilisation of all classes of combustible material in
the boiler furnace, and is so designed as to occupy the least possible space,
leaving the maximum combustion area, with the result of increased heating
surface and increased steaming capacity. Highest thermal efficiency
guaranteed.
The air pressure is equalised throughout the entire length of the
grate.
The initial cost of the furnace is low, and maintenance practically
nil. It is guaranteed to BURN SLACK COAL, DUFF, TOWN REFUSE,
TRADE REFUSE, COKE BREEZE, PEAT AND LIGNITE, and, in fact.
anything that contains carbon,
hydrogen or sulphur, thereby
effecting considerable saving where
the fuel normally used was good
coal.
We are prepared to instal these
furnaces on a guarantee and approval
basis.

Finished design of a Destructor by The Furnace and Power Plant Construction
ACTING UNDER SOLE LICENSE for Australia and New Zealand
for the New Destructor Co., Pershore, England, comprising the amalgama-
tion of Horsfall and Hughes Sterling, the Furnace and Power Plant
Construction Co. (Aust.), Ltd., claim that their destructors are the only
ones in the world which have true balance draught system with mechanical
elimination of smoke and dust from flue gas.
We are prepared to submit schemes for any size of plant to deal
with all kinds of refuse, complete with accessory machinery manufactured
in Australia, buildings, chimney shaft, etc., as well as Screening Plant,
Plant for utilisation of clinker produced, to turn same into carpeting
for road surfacing or otherwise.
FORCED DRAUGHT. —The air required, which is preheated, for
forced draught in connection with the burning of refuse of all kinds, and
the best method of creating such draught, has been made the subject of
special study, and, depending upon local conditions and requirements,
we can either put forward forced draught by means of fans—either engine
driven, motor driven, or belt driven—or forced draught by means either
of silent steam-jet draught with patent compartment grades which ensure
equal static pressure throughout the grate.
Our modern system of steam-jet draught is now one of the most
economical in the market, and in connection with any destructor plant of
old pattern, we are able to show an immense saving by the adoption of
modern apparatus such as we now supply.
One of the great advantages of our system is that each cell grate hai
its entirely separate control for the supply of steam to create the draught
required, and in this manner there is no waste of steam when any
particular furnace is either out of use, or is being clinkered.
BUILDING WORK. —This is carried out under our own skilled
foremen by directly-employed labor drawn as far as possible from the
near vicinity of the contract.
DESIGNS. —We are always prepared to supply the preliminary
drawings and estimates, so often necessary to lay before any Council
requiring a Refuse-disposal Plant. These will be supplied free with all
necessary details, and the services of our Engineers are at all times avail-
able to discuss the suggestions put forward. Our Engineers are all of
ripe experience as regards furnace work, and consequently our designs
may be confidently accepted as sound modern practice.
RECONSTRUCTIONS AND REPAIRS. —We are prepared to
examine, report upon, and tender for all kinds of repairs and the
reconstruction of existing Refuse-disposal Plants, the examination being
carried out by a competent engineer of wide experience, ensuring sound
and lasting results if the work is entrusted to us.
TROPICAL AND SEMI-TROPICAL REFUSE.— We have special-
ised in the design of plants for dealing with the refuse of tropical and
semi-tropical districts, and shall be pleased to supply drawings on receipt
of particulars.
SMALL DISPOSAL PLANTS. —We have special standard self-
contained plants for dealing with refuse from small Towns, Camps,
Hospitals and other Institutions, Works and the like
STEAM RAISING. —Our plants can be arranged in conjunction
with any type of boiler with a view to obtaining the maximum amount o
steam power available for the destruction of the refuse, the quantity of
the steam produced being dependent upon the calorific value of the
refuse to be destroyed.
We guarantee that the thermal efficiency of our destructor-plants is
second to none.
SANITARY RESULTS. —Our chief aim is to ensure a high
temperature in the combustion chamber at all times, and thus by proper
regulation of the air supply to ensure complete combustion of the gases,
and thus prevent the emission of any foul products of combustion from
the chimney shaft.
The “Horsfall” Patent Steam-raising Destructor (Front or Back
Feed) for Colliery and Factory Rubbish has been specially designed for
raising steam, without smoke or nuisance, from very low-grade fuel, such
as washery sludge, coke refuse, factory rubbish, etc.
Since an evaporation of 1 lb. of water to 1 lb. of fuel is sufficient in
most cases to pay working costs, it is evident that in thousands of cases
a heavy saving can be effected by burning-up low-class fuels on the
premises where they are produced, and so saving the value of coal and
cost of tipping rubbish, burning pit hills, etc. That this fact is now
becoming generally recognised is shown by the large number of inquiries
and orders received for plant of this description.
Heavily stayed and lined with ( the best quality of firebrick, the
“Horsfall” Furnace is provided with forced draught on the fan or steam-
jet system. A special feature is the hot-blast arrangement, and the
furnace doors, grate bars, etc., are very carefully designed and
constructed to suit the requirements of the case.
This furnace can be supplied to any class or size of boiler.

The first public function to be handled by
the new Governor will be the annual meet-
ing of the Benevolent Society on the 29tli,
the day after his arrival. It will be held,
as usual, in the grounds of the Royal Hos-
pital for Women.
The City Fathers have voted the Mayor
an extra £3OOO for the entertainment of the
British Fleet. Besides the official capers
there’s to be a big dance affair at the Rose
Bay Golf Club; and the committee of the
ball for the Deaf and Dumb promise that the
Town Hall will scintillate with gold braid
and brassoed buttons—the new Viking and
his lady have promised to be present.
Another bud of the peerage is on her way
to Australia. She is Lady Gloria Fane,
and report says she is leaving the ancestral
halls to take a course of singing lessons from
Melba. The lass is only 21, is the younger
sister of Lord Westmorland and was beaten
in the race for professional fame by her step-
mother, Catherine Countess of Westmorland,
a contralto who last year made her first
public appearance at a National Sunday
League concert; afterwards the Coliseum
gave the titled one an engagement. Gloria’s
real mother was a sister of that Lord Ross-
lyn who was once an aide in Australia.
But this tide of peers and peeresses sweep-
ing up jobs threatens to swamp the honest
workingman’s children. And more than jobs.
How many millionaires’ daughters have netted
royalties and near-royalties this last two
years. Uncertain of the crowns, these latter
go full-speed ahead after the half-crowns.
Unless they are mentally deficient or hope-
lessly homely, the stage and the films supply
others of them with incomes. So far, how-
ever, the struggle has been mainly to get
money for the sons. But it will be the
daughters’ turn next. Then the sixpenny
bar, the next-best matrimonial market to the
stage, will be no longer secure. In a very
few years Bung may be advertising “Only
titled barmaids need apply.”
The Opera House ran up the “house full”
sign at the matinee for Prince Alfred’s. The
guinea seats supported masses of expensive
summer frocking, and a box on the right
hand shrined knight Owen Cox and his
niece Miss Bonsor, the balance being sus-
tained by Gladys Moncrieff and her hus-
band on the other side. Gladys wore a three-
piece black marocain with Egyptian illumina-
tions on its top section, and one of those
coquettish little waist-length capes. She
topped this with black satin millinery of
the inverted-bowl variety that carried a pink
rose on its brim. Gladys, though advertised
to give a song, didn’t oblige, but helped
Andrew Higginson to auction gollywogs and
perfumes. Irene Vanbrugh, in a duck of a
lace dress, deep ivory in tone, and a hat
which a bird-of-Paradise had taken for a
Celestial perch, played upon her listeners’
hearts with “The Barrel Organ,” a mono-
logue that had much to do with Kew in lilac-
time, a sparkling fire of runs and chords
being supplied by accompanist Mary McCor-
mack. Dot Boucicault got a great hand for
his R.L.S. “Plots for Plays.” But Pharus
the Egyptian romped home first favorite. In
two seconds he had the most conservative
Darling Pointer stripping off her 50-button
white kids to try the finger-nail friction cure
for the blues and falling hair. Owen Cox
testified his faith in his own coming Samson
growth by investing in a sporty flame-
colored crin. hat, knocked down to him by
Gladys Moncrieff for £2 12s. 6d. Lorna
and Toots Pounds, Nellie Kolle, Jen Latona
and the Havana Band were other sparklers
on a programme all gems. The hospital nets
over £6OO from the afternoon.
Queensland Insurance Co.’s general man-
ager, Alexander Me Vernon, and his popu-
lar wife go to the south of Europe by the
Mooltan. They drop off to notice how Mus-
solini runs things; then London claims them.
Norway, Ireland and the Continent again
will see them before they sail for America
by _ the Aquitania, the floating palace on
which the traveller has to walk some miles
to catch a glimpse of the ocean wave. Mrs.
Me Vernon leaves her beloved garden at
Bellevue Hill to the care of niece Essie Bray,
who is also to see that the ice-chest is in
order against the liomc-coming in the hot
days of next December.
Two things the Queensland Co.’s insurance
wizard allows himself to be rather proud of.'
He was one of tlie first life-savers on the
Sydney beaches, and he was among the first
if not the very first in Sydney to employ a
woman typist in his office.
Even in farewell parties the sterner stuff
gets the handsome deal. Take the Denison
couple, who also go by the Mooltan. Last
week the lady had a Mizpah bun and a cup
of home-brew from the Royal Colonial Insti-
tute teapot, to help her remember the over-
flowing hearts of Australia ; but for the mere
man of the combination a whole lunch was
spread at the Australia by the Fellows and
Associates of the Bligh-street institution.
No doubt Eve took the first bite of the
apple. But 10 chances to one it was the
only mouthful she got.
Ruth Cansdell, eldest daughter of the late
Gordon Cansdell and Mrs. Cansdell, is going
to marry Stewart Wells, of Worthing
(Eng. ). Ruth is a grand-daughter of the
late Judge Cansdell, and reckons the Deloittes
among her uncles and her cousins.
Lesley Reading, of Darling Point, is enjoy-
ing the benefits of travel. While touring she
met Noel Heath, of Melbourne, and Cupid
did the rest. The engagement is announced,
and the wedding fixed for an early date.
The Wedding March pealed through St.
Philip's for another pretty bride and her
’groom last week. This time the principals
were Laurel Scott, of Dulwich Hill, and her
ex-soldier, Henry Jackson, of Cremorne. The
bridal finery was of ivory brocade and silver
lace, with a pearl-embroidered train of cloth
of silver, over which tulle veiling curled and
swayed like a mountain mist. There were
two youthful matrons of honor in luscious
pink and gold frocking : two bridesmaids in
turquoise blue and gold, and a train-bearer
in ivory georgettes and pink rosebuds. These
sartorial glories were supported by four
’groomsmen. The cake was cut amid jazz
and fizz at the Cavalier, where the bride’s
mother hostessed in handsome frocking of
grey that carried heavy embroideries of steel
and cherry.
Kenneth Gordon, of Glen Alpine, Werris
Creek, joined the ranks of the benedicts last
week at St. John’s, Ashfield, the home suburb
of the bride, pretty Edith Wilkinson. The
’groom is the eldest son of J. S. Gordon, a
well-known North-West pastoralist, and is
one of the two Gordon boys who were in-
terned for four long years in Ruhleben Camp.
His sister Kathleen is one of the many who
are leaving for England by the Mooltan.
The latest undertaking of the Red Cross
is a children’s home on the Mountains. Mrs.
Mackinnon put the project before a meeting
of office-bearers and friends of the Red Cross
in the Assembly Hall of the Education De-
partment last week, when it transpired that
Eadith Walker was the good fairy who had
conjured up the house of health. She is
lending her house, Slmna, at Leura; but
cheques for upkeep will be welcomed. Mrs.
Mitchell, well known for her after-care work,
will be in charge, with a detachment of Blue-
Mountain V.A.’s to assist. Dr. Dick (Rand-
wick) has promised to examine the small
guests for Shuna, so that nothing “catching”
will pass the threshold. Incidentally, the
Junior Red Cross Pageant will happen at
the Town Hall on May 19 and 20. The
new Viking and his lady are booked for the
opening, and the G.-G. Forsters for the
second night.
Another voyager by the Mooltan will be
Florence Fox-Benson, who has been con-
nected with journalism in Sydney for the
past 16 years.
Her first
efforts ap-
peared in Fair
I J LAY, for
many years
.she was on
the staff of
the T E le-
graph, and
she has done a
great deal of
free- lancing.
Her brother
Frank was
with TH e
Bulletin and
the Lone
Hand before
he went to
London to
take up the
news-e d i t o r-
ship of the
Morning
Post. Mr. Benson, who accompanies his
wife, will lecture on Australia at Wembley
Park during the Exhibition.
The list of givers to the Dame Margaret
Testimonial (it mounted to a neat little
£1600) has been bound in Madonna-blue
leather, with a tiny gold map of Australia
in each corner ill a setting of turquoise and
jade; and the edges are tooled heavily in
gold. A. pity such a handsome shrine should
hold so little. Wal Taylor’s hands fashioned
it.
May Matthews had her final farewell tea-
drinking on Friday, when the rose-decorated
drawung-room of the Carlton smelled like
the Valley of Sliaron or a box of compressed
bath salts. Mrs. J. A. Wilson hostessed this
event in leaf-green frocking, and contrived
a successful Ave and Vale duet, for with
one hand she greeted a vivacious English
actress, Ethel Newman, all grey georgettes
and black hat, while with the other she
waved a good-bye to brown-hatted May. Inky
Wayfarers were scattered through the assem-
bly ; and to them the departing guest made a
very pretty speech into which she managed
to pack thanks for personal favors, a re-
minder that much of the welfare of humanity
lay within their fountain-pens, and a more-
than-hint that the Australian journalist was
second to none.
England having capriciously turned cold
on the old dear, St. Valentine had almost
determined to become a naturalised American
citizen, when Stewart Dawson stepped for-
ward and suggested that he might become
an Aussie instead. So the Ambassadors
was turned into a temple of bleeding hearts
and rosy garlands on the eve of the Senti-
mental Saint’s day, and Sydney kept vigil
in the subterranean marble halls. Hearts
and Darts were everywhere. Hearts—
fatty, degenerate hearts—of red, red roses
pierced with silver arrows swooned on each
table. Strings of hearts like some sort of new
smallgoods dangled everywhere. There was
some handsome and exotic frocking among
the aisles, the most noted being that of Miss
Bonsor and Mrs. Otter. Heads that had
been shingled and heads that needed thatch-
ing bent at an inflammable closeness, while
to lowered lights a male voice poured out
the impassioned query“ Will You Be My
Valentine?”
Not many artists can say they’ve helped
to make the way easy for the salesman of
beads and calico. Here’s the exception. He
is Ellis Silas, and May Moore’s camera has
reproduced the
Spanish look
of him. The
young man’s
journals of life
in the Trobri-
ands have been
bought by the
Mitchell
Library, and
are now free
to students of
Island lore,
The artist,
who was, in
all, three
years studying
and painting
brown brother
and amber sis-
ter, has learned
to speak the
language flu-
ently. Not the
least p a r t,
therefore, of the new Mitchell Library pur-
chase is the glossary of native words and
phrases. Four colorful drawings go with
the journals.
There’s to be a garden fete at the end of
the month for the Mater Hospital in North
Sydney. It’s to have a real garden atmo-
sphere, for the stalls and tea-tent will be
pitched in the pretty old grounds surround-
ing the private wing. That untiring worker,
Mrs. Leahy, is president.
Those two pretty creatures Peggy and
Lena Chisholm are now starring in America.
The girls, who went as chicks from their
Northern Rivers home, having won Royal
Academy scholarships for the violin and
piano, have not been back to Australia for
nearly 10 years. But there’s talk of the
two coming home in 1925.
Those cheery Vagabonds, who run miracu-
lously successful comedies that never seem
to cost anything, are raising the wind again,
this time in the interests of the Red Cross
Auxiliary, whose workers are moving from
Jamieson-street to Rose Hall, Darlingliurst.
The money-box lias a hollow sound, and it’s
the object of the Vagabonds to feed it. Ber-
nard Parry’s “Purse Strings” is the money-
spinner which Will weave on April 6 at St.
James’s Hall.
Mrs. Caroline Chisholm is not the only
heroine of that name. Take the case of Mrs.
Chisholm, who looks after the post office at
Mount Darragh, on top of the coast range
in the far south-east of N. S. Wales. When
she first went there, 18 years ago, the place
was a mass of timber and scrub. There
was a track of sorts from Catlicart, seven
miles away, and she walked in, carrying her
baby, no other means of locomotion being
possible. Later, in order to give the kids
of the place some education, she drove the
school van into Catlicart for seven years in
all weathers, along what was called by cour-
tesy a road.
Mrs. Katherine 1 Beau) Burdekin is not
letting her pen rust since her return to
England. She has written a mediaeval
play, “Morgan le Fay,” which that very
critical body the Royal Academy Dramatic
Art Society liked well enough to produce
last month. The well-known actress Mrs.
Laura Cowie played lead.
The delayed appearance of a recent bride was
owing to some absent-minded person forget-
ting to instruct the car to call back for the
principal lady. But a taxi-driver tells a
story of a last week’s bride who kept her
’groom waiting an hour and a half. When
the car unloaded its freight of satin and tulle
veilings the demented husband-to-be was)
feverishly pacing up and down the pavement
outside the fashionable church, his gloves
split between the fingers, their wrenched-
off buttons crunched into powder, while
scouting parties of guests were stationed at
different corners along the bridal route. The
orange-blossomed personage who had caused
the upheaval remarked pleasantly, “Afraid
I’m a bit late, but hired cars can’t be de-
pended on.” “And,” the taxi-driver con-
cludes with bitterness, “me waiting outside
that blessed girl’s door for 90 minutes by me
wrist-watch!”
Whatever excuses did our lagging sisters
make in pre-motoring days? For there seem
to have been even worse delays then. Don’t
you remember (of course, you don’t, not
being your own grandma) Phil May’s draw-
ing of the distracted ’groom waiting on the
church steps and the crowd of smah boys
who tried to cheer him with the reflection
that perhaps there hadn’t been an accident,
after all—perhaps she’d merely thought
better of it?
Sydney’s old friends, the American Con-
sular Nortons, dropped into San Francisco
from Canada the other day, and there linked
up with veteran Frank Coffee. This brought
back so many happy memories of Australia
that New Year’s Day was largely spent writ-
ing to wish the friends they left behind them
a happy half-century.
Enterprising Leslie Macpherson has pasted
her name on 179 Rue de Courcelles, Paris,
and undertakes to help sister and brother
Aussies who don’t know their way about the
gay city.
A Brisbane postscript
Sir Matthew, after inspecting the apples at Stan-
thorpe, presided at a Council meeting in Toowoomba,
lunched with the City Fathers there, and thin
moved on to .Ipswich, where he spoke before the
Royal Geographies and opened the additions to the
local Tech., timing his return to Brisbane for the
Theatre Royal’s opening night with the Reynolds-de
Tisne, co. in “Twelfth Night.”
The Press Institute farewelled Tom Heney and
his wife at its annual meeting on Valentine’s Day.
The Ritz was the scene of operations, and there
were many laudatory speeches, Spencer Browne, Nor-
man White, E. E. Edwards, Pat Leahy and C. E.
Sligo taking a voice in the matter. The presentation
of a gold-mounted smokers’ outfit rounded off the
afternoon. Pat Leahy is the new president of the
Institute, and J. H. Lewis takes over the office if
hon. sec. Among those who clapped hands and
partook of tea and cakes were the Percy Rears,
the Lavises and Taylors, Mrs. Forrest and the
Sligo, Arundel and Spencer Browne ladies, S.
Nally (who is just off to U.S.A. on publicity work),
F. J. Bryan, W. H. Smith and Rupert Felsted. Dr.
Ward and “Gossip” started the Institute in Brisbane
a few years ago, and it has eaten many lunches and
drunk many cups of tea in distinguished company
since then.
Henry Tryon, whose years outnumber three-seore-
and-ten, and who was the victim of a brutal assault
by roughs when walking on a lonely road a few
weeks ago, is just out of hospital and struggling
back to his job in the entomological section of
the Agricultural Department, leaning on a stick,
with his good looks at least unimpaired, though he
fears his health has been permanently affected. He
has had messages of sympathy from many parts of
the world and all over Australia. His attackers—
who are still at large—have let it be known that
they “mistook him for someone else.”
The Bellevue looked very smart for Mrs. Wallis
Hoare’s luncheon to Nancy Macnaughton, who will
be Mrs. Baring Gould before this gets into print.
Pale blue water-lilies surrounding a lake, with yards
of lavender tulle, made exquisitely cool-looking decora-
tions for the party. Amongst those who admired
them were the A. H. Whittingham, Alan Jeffray
and McNab ladies, Nancy’s handsome mother, Mar-
jorie Byram, Mollie Brenan and Elma White.
Mauve and pink asters expressed their delight in
welcoming the N. S. Wales and Vic. swimmers at
the suggestion of the Q. Ladies’ Amateur Swimmers
Assoc. Frank de Little’s wife and Mrs. Fry held out
the hand of greeting; and Mrs. Chambers answered
for N.S.W., while Mrs. Marston said “Thank you’
for Victoria. And Dobby’s band played prettily.
Alan Shannon, of Wyalla and Saltbush Park, has
persuaded “Pete” (Irene May) Lodge, of Jackroyd,
Rockhampton, formerly of Melbourne, to accept the
sparkling ring which leads to the plain gold band.
Adare, New Farm, was the scene of a tea to
Mrs. J. N. Devoy, when Mrs. Stewart gathered two
or three together to farewell the intending voyager.
Mrs. Stanley Chapman was also bidden adieu at a
bridge party organised by Mrs. E. A. Cullen. Then
Gladys Pollard, who is off by the Osterley, had
several valedictory shivoos. One was given by her
sister, the wife of Dr. Robertson; a dinner was
staged by the Espie Dods pair at the Bellevue, and
there was another big tea-drinking at Palma Rosa
whereat the Cannans, Brenans, Gilbert Lees, Hal
fords, Markses and Bruches, Mrs. Frank Corrie and
Dr. Lilian Cooper were among the farewellers.

At the investiture function staged in the
Government House ballroom the other after-
noon, the crude daylight and day-time tailor-
ings collided violently with the picturesque
side of a ceremonial which is a survival of
the age of chivalry and satin suitings. Both
Federal and State Exes, and their united
staffs gladdened the dais with a dazzle of
gold and silver lace. Lady Forster looked,
of course, nice, but yet modern, in cinnamon-
brown georgette, whose sleeves Hashed gold-
en ly. The Countess Stradbroke trailed mediae-
val draperies of brown silk, embossed with
gold, under a bronze picture-liat coroneted
with gold leaves. Ex-State Treasurer William
McPherson, Hugh Denison and Statistician
George Knibbs were gingerly flat-sworded on
either shoulder by the G.-G. and told
to “Rise, Sir Knight.” Colonel Tim
Mclnerney, who worried through the trying
ordeal without having joined in the morning
rehearsal, got through quite nicely, but over-
looked obeisances both in the advance
and the retreat. His little lot was an
Auxiliary Forces medal. Premier Lawson
and Willie Watt were posted on one side of
the vice-regal elevation, and Government
House relatives and visitors were stationed
round the room. Lady Dunleath flew blue
ostrich plumes on the fawn hat which topped
her fawn hangings; Lady Ellen Lambert, in
blue and white patterned foulard, also .sup-
ported a feathery hat; and Lady Pat Black-
wood and Mrs. Pitt Rivers were rival studies
in mauve silk with flower-trimmed lids. The
two Stradbroke daughters were there with
Hester Fhillimore. Littleton Groom stood
to attention near the vice-regal Presence, but,
contrary to expectation, was not called on
to step up for his knightly emblems. Walter
Manifold drifted in, looking surprisingly fit
after many weeks on the sick-list. The cere-
mony was agreeably followed by afternoon
tea in the buffet, and their Exes, shook hands
with the hungry as they filed in.
The vice-regal Stradbrokes are much con-
cerned about things that have been said
of their daughter Pleasance, and are offi-
cially “contradicting” the false statements,
without pausing to explain what the false
statements were; wherefore half the popula-
tion is burying its nose in the files of the
Victorian press in a palpitating search after
the story.
Saturday’s race crowd was steeped in
bewilderment when it found the Caulfield
stands still in the throes of enlargement and
repair. And it was a crowd, though very
poorly sprinkled with petticoats. Anyway,
the uprooted terrace put a stopper on any
attempt at dress parade. With the whole
available ground space littered with humans,
it would have been as easy to locate a pal
in a footer scrum as to spy out the best-
known on the course. The few who were
sighted had mostly come in inconspicuous
suitings. Several women defied the moist
heat with fur wraps—in fact, one heroic
soul went so far as to swelter under a seal-
skin cloak of an expensiveness which in
cooler circumstances would have driven the
others of her sex to furious envy.
Dr. Charlie Ryan, who is sheltering at the
Melbourne Club until he dumps his kit on
an outward-bound P. and O. boat, was in
the stand, and Justice Schutt, lately back
from a Colombo trip, was there with friends.
Ella Guthrie turned up in black, but her
sister, Mrs. Philip Russell, scratched for
the event in order to keep an eye on her
husband, who has fallen on the sick-list.
Clive Leonard’s fair-haired wife sat in the
committee pen under a rose-colored hat sup-
porting pink ribbon flowers on its brim. The
James Grice daughter, Mrs. Alec Howatson,
cheered a black frock with a royal purple
hat, one end of its silken swathe tickling her
left ear. Mrs. Norman Falkiner, who has
now assumed a girlish slimness, was neatly
tailored in grey tweed, and thatched her
brown head with a little pull-on hat of
purple. Commodore Hyde’s wife was simi-

Prominent Catholic laymen are asking
each other in whispers whether it is certain
that Archbishop Mannix will return from
Maoriland, whither he went to take part in
the celebration of the jubilee of Archbish.
Redwood. They have heard a rumor that he
may slip off via America; but they are scep-
tical, partly because they don’t want to be-
lieve, and partly because they see difficulties
in the way of his taking at least one of two
bigger jobs that may become vacant overseas.
The Women’s Automobile Club tapped its
new season’s brew of tea-and-music before
a bumper house. The visiting opera-P'rince
Oblensky, Dawn Assheton and Alex. Wright
were chief lions, while Dolly Stewart and
Victor Baxter—the youthful tenor whose
voice is to get its chance in small parts in
the forthcoming opera productions—headed
the group of singing stars. The club presi-
dent, Mrs. H. M. Robertson, who engineered
the musical menu, hostessed in a myrtle
green silk gown with a mammoth ribbon
bow athwart her white straw hat, and she
received stalwart support from Mrs. J. H.
Rhodes (vice-president), in navy blue mavo-
cain with red embellishments and a blue hat
speared through with a scarlet dagger, and
hon. sec. Esme Allee, who wore Paisley
effects under black millinery. In the gather-
ing were Mrs. Max Trytliall, who convoyed
the Prince, the John Tait and Springthorpe
dames, and Kathleen Malone. The room
looked as if a patch of the Bush had been
transplanted therein with its wealth of scar-
let gum blossom and eucalyptus leaves.
Confetti is being ordered in for the wed-
ding of Gwen Dundas and Jim McCaul. He
and two brothers came down from their rub-
ber plantations in the Malay States to cool
off for six months in their native Australia,
and he met Gwendoline a few weeks back
at a little dance-party given by Yvonne
Deschamps. In less than a fortnight he had
won the lass, and after the Voice has
Breathed, as it will do some time this month,
he will carry her off to liis Malayan fastness.
Inky Wayfarers packed the upper dining-
room at Anzac House .on Thursday for
the A.J.A. lunch to Dame Nellie, who came
with Henry Russell, Phil Finklestein and
her new personal sec., a rosy-cheeked young
penman named Beverley Nicholls, who nas
been using his nib with the Northcliffe press.
The Dame rushed in revealing frankly eeri e
silk upholstery with a darker floral note
and a flat brown toque with brown veil.
Mrs. Serjeant White, the woman member
of the Vic. Council, welcomed the guest in
brown tailorings and handed her a little
pink-and-blue posy. The gathering was a
cheery affair. The Ideal A.J.A. president
opened up a short interval of talk with a
neat little verbal bouquet for the Dame, who,
pleading a sore throat, confined her response
to inviting the assembled writers to plump
for her October concert for limbless soldiers
as they never plumped before. The opera,
she declared, did not matter —the concert
was the thing. After the last crumbs had been
swallowed the leading lady rushed off again,
distributing handshakes :on her way.
In his speech Henry Russell let the guests
into one guilty secret blotting his profes-
sional past. The scanty booking for one of
his opera seasons drove him to state that
Maeterlinck was crossing the Herring Pond
to. be present at the first night and did not
wish to be interviewed on his arrival. The
reporters rose to the bait and flocked to all
incoming liners. Finally Henry rushed a
man ashore disguised as the great author,
and an interviewer initiated into the secret
met him at one of the big hotels. The pub-
licity gained thereby assured the opera
crowded houses. Maeterlinck had, of course,
been warned of the stunt beforehand. Rus-
sell further remarked that if Melba would
only shoot at him the success of the season
here would be assured. La, la! So much
for art!
Dolly Stewart, composer, entertainer • and
pianist, pictured herewith by Ruskin, is off
to try her luck under the Stars and Stripes.
On Monday next the Melbourne Town Hall
will house a farewell complimentary concert
engineered for
her benefit by
a big group of
citizens, headed
by the George
Tallis dame,
T. Rya n.
M.L.A., and
others. Several
of her compo-
sitions will be
aired, includ-
ing two song

the first time.
Mynd e 1 1 e

lend hand or voice to the programme and, as
Dolly Stewart devoted much time and energy
to patriotic causes during the war and has
never hesitated to answer the call of charity
since, there is sure to be a fat “house.”
Carmen Pinschof, who married the tall
and military-looking Arthur Harris —remem-
bered in Melbourne as a social light and
amateur actor —has settled down with ner
man in Batavia, where he is commander-in-
chief of the Nestles Food Co. Carmen has
given up her operatic ambitions to reign as
the domestic queen of an ex-residency which
is floored with marble and has several rooms
big enough to stage a coronation. She doesn't
like the climate, but cool storage and abund-
ance of servants at cut rates —a star Chinese
cook can be had for a pound a week —enable
her to smile at the worst the wet bulb can
produce.
The Reggie Wilmots have sold their
roomy old Brighton home, Boort, which has
sheltered four generations of the family, to
settle at Mont Albert. This uprooting fol-
lows on the illness of the youngest daughter,
who has been ordered a long tonic of mountain
breezes. Dad is known to tlie man-in-the-
styeet as “Old Boy,” his pen-name as a
sporting writer. He further uses ink as
sec. of the Old Melburnians and also of the
Melbourne Athemeum. One daughter fol-
lows his steps along the Inky Way, and
chronicles the sporting activities of the vari-
ous girls’ schools for the Australasian.

larat band conductor. No one was more sur-
prised than Alec Wright himself when lie
struck success as a grand-opera artist,
although he had got some good stage experi-
ence as understudy with the J. C. W. Comics,
and even played Bcppo in “Maid of the
Mountains” on tour. Up to four and a hair
years back the young man—lie confesses to
25 —earned his crust on his dad’s farm at
Smeaton.
Mrs. Teddy Dyson, just back from her
Ceylon trip, and her sister Mrs. Russell-
Jackson, with a return ticket to Maoriland
and Honolulu in her kit-bag, combined to
stage a welcome-farewell tea at Menzies’ a
few days ago. The cups, mustering nearly
half a hundred strong, rattled at the end of
the lounge, which had been roped in for the
event. Mrs. Teddy, dimpled engagingly under
a dashing red liat, which surmounted rosy
embroidered bangings, while her sister sup-
ported full-skirted silk suggestive of creamed
strawberries, and a becoming hat.
On the following afternoon the pair were
again caught in a whirl of how-dye-do’s and
good-byes at a similar frivol in the same
spot, the hostesses this time being the James
Angus, E. V. Richardson, Hidgcock and Hil-
yard matrons. The sister-guests w r ere half-
submerged in floral trophies, and the tea-
table was flowered over with pink carnations.
Mrs. Ross, wife of the Canadian Commis-
sioner—they are off next month for a nine-
months’ trip to their native land —came in
for a share of the au revoir wishes. So did
Mrs. Sep Power.
The E. W. Outhwaites’ elder daughter
Helen, who has just engaged herself to
Alastair Gray, son of the Scotclibyterian
Girls’ College head, was principal girl at a
bridge-playing hostessed by Mrs. Ben Boothby
and daughter Marjorie at their Malvern
home the other afternoon. Mrs. Ben smiled
her welcomes in navy blue, while Marjorie
radiated in jade-green georgette dashed with
Oriental embroidery and sported green roses
on her big black hatbrim. The bride-elect
was in navy marocain topped off with a
droopy grey hat. •
At the Princess’s Theatre, a few nights ago,
after the ordinary show, the Fuller brothers
and Hugh Ward staged a dance party in
honor of the newly-arrived Seymour Hicks
pair. The thing, which was splendidly pro-
duced, popped off with cocktails in the
foyer, and ended with supper somewhere
about 3 o’ the morning. The foxtrotters
were mostly of the profesh, but the Gaud
Mayor and Mrs. Brunton, the civic Jeffries,
the Crespins and a group of other outsiders
had been asked in. And—please howl it
gently—one or two wore there who had not
been invited. Seymour Hicks, as dapper, if
not so springy, as in his days,
and Ellaline Terris-llicks. undulating in sea-
green velvet which broke into a silvery wave
at the hem. supped at a round table with
Hugh Ward and his wife, who was hand-
somely upholstered in black satin foamed
over with lace. Barbara Hoffe, the
new leading lady, is a beautiful young
person, who came with her Welsh Guards
husband, Captain Oaksliott. She was in
pink georgette roped in at the hip-line with
silken flowers. Betty Hicks sparkled in
crystal-beaded tulle over a white satin
sheathing. Lady Pat Blackwood was there
m black drapings anchored with coral and
jet emplacements. Mamie Watson danced in
pale yellow; Grade Lavers, convoyed by
fiance King Baillieu, supported jade green
satin flounced with silver lace; the John
1' tuler daughter, Phyllis, dimpled in rosy
crepe de Chine; and Dorothy Brunton spread
full skirts of silver lace under a silver
straight-jacket.
Authoress Kathleen Watson Dearden sig-
nals from Brisbane that daughter Irma is
preparing to leave the family roof-tree at
the instigation of Rupert Flower, the only
son of the late John Henry Flower. After
the orange-blossom ceremony the pair will
settle in Maoriland. Little Irma’s age still
ran in single figures when her parents trans-
ported her and schoolboy brother Charlie—
he afterwards took to the stage—to Queens-
land ; but she has tripped back on several
occasions to stay with her childhood chums,
the Geoff. Symes’ elder girls, Mardi and
Hilaria.
May Cox, the winsome officer in charge of
the Education Department's patriotic activi-
ties for nine strenuous years, not to mention
her regular job of swimming supervisor for
the State, has had to acknowledge at last
that there must come an end to too-hard
work and heavy responsibility. Under medical
advice the young organiser is to make a trip
to the Cold Country in search of health.
During the war neuritis put her right hand
out of action, and her doctor ordered a com-
plete rest. “I’ll learn to write and type
with my left hand,” laughed the plucky
patriot, and stuck to her job of raising hun-
dreds of thousands of pounds for the fighting
men. When peace came she was plunged
into home-building for down-and-out soldiers,
and perpetual interviews by soldiers in
trouble, and she kept hard at it until family
bereavement came as the last straw.
On Valentine’s Day, ’64, Tait Russell met
a shy young woman at the altar of St.
John’s, Ballarat East, and the Rev. Duncan
Fraser said the words necessary to make
them man and wife. Last week they had a
diamond wedding at Upper Hawthorn, and
congratulations from two sons, one daughter,
a dozen grand-cliildren and no end of friends
were lavished on them. In ’52, a year after
the discovery of gold, Tait Russell came in
the clipper Aberdeen on her frnst voyage to
Melbourne. Boort was the home of the
family for many years after it had turned
its back on Ballarat.
A little gossip from Adelaide:—
Maude Priest is back from overseas with sketches
in plenty, and the diploma and membership certificate
of the British Water-color Society in her luggage.
Most of her time was spent studying in Paris and
London, with some sketching tours in Normandy,
Belgium and Cornwall by the way.
The engagement of the week is that of birdman
Keith Smith and Mrs. Anita Crawford, daughter of
Lieut-Col. and Mrs. D. H. Smith, of Norwood. She
settled herself down in London a year or so ago as
buyer for a big drapery firm here, and he’s at the
moment with Vickers.
A meeting in the Mayor’s parlor . set on foot
a scheme to buttress the finances of our hospitals.
The suggestion is for a three-days’ effort every
year-—on Friday in the country, on Saturday
at places of amusement and sports, and on Sunday
in the churches. The committee that is to run
the scheme includes two well-tried war-workers —
Mrs. Wallington and Mrs. Ernest Good (by the way,
the marriage of the second Good twin to Keith
Angas is fixed for April) ; and there’ll be representa-
tives of the Boards of the hospitals concerned.
A carnival to launch an appeal for funds for ex-
tending the nursing sisters’ hospital ,in North Adel-
aide struck a gusty night that ended in violent
rain-squalls, and effectually damped the ardor of
buyers and sellers. However, it was a three-days’
affair, so there was time to make up some of the
lost ground.
All S. Australia is sympathising with Langdon
Bonython: his wife, for many years past an invalid,
died within the week. In the days when she actively
heiped her husband in his good works she assisted
to found the District Trained Nurses’ Society, and
she was for 20 years a member of the State Children’s
Council and a keen supporter of the Kindergarten
Union. Under her will the District Trained
Nurses’ Society and the Kindergarten each get
£2OO, and the Y.W.C.A. and the Pirie-street Dorcas
Society £lOO each.
Lady Bridges has gone to Melbourne; she will
spend most of her time with Melba at Coombe
Cottage.
The Amateurs’ Meeting and a perfect day took
everyone who isn’t at the seaside or the hills to the
Cheltenham races, and incidentally produced some
smarter frocking than a race-meeting has seen here
for a long time. White with flashes of vivid
green, mastic embroidered with more green, and a
golden brown marocain topped with a hat to match
beplumed with more green, were among the most
arresting rig-outs, and a couple of striped silks on
two of the youngest set were a triumph of line and
simplicity.

CONVERSION and REDEMPTION of
WAR GRATUITY BONDS.
We gratefully acknowledged the sacrifices and the services of
our soldiers by issuing bonds, and now the time has come when
payment must be arranged for. The operation is a large one, and
the Government asks for the support of the people in carrying it
through.
The Government appeals to all those holders of bonds who
do not urgently need cash to leave the money with the Treasury
for a further period, and the Government cadis for subscriptions in
cash from the general public in order that those bondholders who
do not convert into the new loan may be paid off.
Interest at the rate of 6 per cent, is offered on this new loan.
That rate is a very good one.
The new loam will be repayable in 3 or 5 or 10 years, at the
option of the subscriber, that option to be exercised now.
Prospectuses and forms will be available at all Banks and
Post Offices. In the meantime, new subscriptions will be received
by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. A deposit of 5 per
cent, or any higher percentage will be accepted, and the
Government will pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent, on the
deposit as from the date when it is made. Interest will be subject
to Commonwealth taxation, but WILL BE FREE OF STATE
INCOME TAXES.

Fight that Film
That’s what keeps your teeth so cloudy
Do you know that dentists all the world
over now advise a new method of teeth
cleaning ? And that millions of people now
use it ? It combats the film —those dingy
coats, the cause of most tooth troubles.
This offers you a io-Day test, and we urge
that you accept it.
Means added beauty
Teeth are clouded by a film —that vis-
cous film you feel. Much of it resists the
tooth brush, clings and stays. Then it
forms dingy coats, and teeth lose their
lustre.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the acid
in contact with the teeth to cause decay. It
breeds millions of germs, and they, with
tartar, are the chief cause of pyorrhea. Very
few people, in the old days, escaped
troubles caused by film.
Protect the Enamel
Pcpsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use
a film combatant which contains
harsh grit.
Made in Australia
mmmmmmmm mi m MARK jg
TRADE
The New-Day Dentifrice.
A scientific tooth paste based on modern
research, now advised by leading dentists
the world over. Two sizes.
Price: 2/- and 1/3
Now they fight it
Dental science, after long research, has
found two ways to fight that film. One acts
to disintegrate the film at all stages of for-
mation. The other removes it without
harmful scouring.
A new-type tooth paste has been created
to apply those methods daily. The name is
Pepsodent. Careful people of some fifty
nations now use it, largely by dental advice.
Some old mistakes
Old ways of teeth cleaning reduced the
alkalinity of the saliva. They reduced its
starch digestant. And those are the factors
on which Nature depends to fight acids
and starch deposits. Pepsodent multiplies
that alkalinity, multiplies that starch diges-
tant. So every use gives manifold power to
these protective agents.
These things mean a new dental era.
They mean much to you and yours. So
we urge you to prove them out.

Note how clean the teeth feel after using.

appear. This test will be a revelation to

what an important part hose plays in our industries.
In every direction Dunlop special hoses have to be made
for special purposes, each being different in construction,
thickness, strength, pliability, etc. We illustrate a variety of
D
that are daily rendering economical service—doing their work
silently and satisfactorily at the minimum cost. In mining
centres air hose is used for drilling machines, working up to a
pressure of 20001b5., whilst the hose used on hydraulic machines
is built to withstand a pressure of 30001bs. Steam hose has to be
constructed to withstand the burning effect on the inner rubber
wall of hose. Delivery hose is used for conducting water, under
moderate pressure, on railways and steamships, for horticultural
purposes, &c., &c. In pumping plants, tanneries, breweries,
irrigation work, and for mining and dredging, suction hoses are
essential, and are constructed so that there is no contraction of
sides of hose during suction operations. In breweries and
wineries a variety of hoses are used for conducting beer,
wine, &c., and have to be constructed with special inside rubber
walls to prevent damaging the taste of the liquor. Again, special
hoses are used for paint spraying, conducting oil, acid, and other
materials deleterious to rubber. The largest users of hose in this
country are the various Railway departments— the Westinghouse
brake air hose and vacuum air brake hose being essential to the
braking systems in operation on our railways, and upon which
the safety of the travelling public and railway transport depend.
Many of the above hoses have to be constructed with a covering of
flat or round wire, or woven cotton, to withstand abrasion in use.
All these hoses call for the highest quality of materials and
special construction, and in this direction “Dunlop” Hoses have
won a fine reputation for dependability and economical service.
Another important factor is that, bung made in Australia
they are free from perish and can be made without delay
to suit the requirements of every branch of industry. We have
an Illustrated Booklet that fully covers these hoses, and shall
be pleased to mail a copy to users of industrial hoses.

Koyal Thought’s victory in the Oakleigk
Plate was a coup tnat should nave been mole gener-
ally expected. The engagement of Prank Dempsey
to ride the eolt was an open confession of the staoie s
confidence, and of Dempsey’s endorsement of its
views. The son of Malt King, although not thrown
into the handicap, was in receipt of a stone, all but
a pound, from (Quintus, whilst some other sprinters of
the same age were giving A. li. Tyson’s three-year-old
a few pounds more. Ail things considered, 33 to 1
was a generous starting price for Royal Thought,
whose jockey snatched the race from (Quintus wnen
victory for the Eceles colors looked almost assured.
It was an unsatisfactory race for punters. The start
was delayed some minutes by the fractiousness of
Bathos and others; the going was a bit heavy, and
neither Heroic nor Tittle )■ lower could get away from
the field as was expected. The first five horses —
Royal Thought, Quintus, Parr, Braehead and Whittier
—are all in the Newmarket, and perhaps f air, a
good-looking English four-year-old, who appears to
be improving with work, will do best along the
Flemington straight. It was only in the last 100yds.
that Farr came right into the picture, and he ran
past Whittier and Braehead to finish third, a neck
behind Quintus.
Accarak’s win in the Bond Cup (12 furlongs)
gives him a great chance for the Australian Cup,
despite the penalty. Berrinbo’s third was also im-
pressive, and it may be that the hurdle-racing son
of Ritualist will stay the 2£ miles at Flemington
better than Chaffey’s horse. All the same, Accarak
is a striking contradiction of the theory that the
Wooraks lack stamina.
Lightsome, a full sister to Gloaming (still winning
in M.L.), got home in the two-year-old sprint, her
first appearance with the colors up. Nevertheless the
defeat of Kaiwarra, by only a few inches, when the
colt was giving her 191 b., didn’t suggest an immedi-
ately brilliant future for the stylish filly. Her
chance of staying the Futurity Stakes course next
Saturday is almost negligible. On what was seen
in the St. George’s Stakes the Futurity should be a
pretty good thing for The Hawk, who has been taken
out of the Newmarket. The Maorilander won in bril-
liant style from Polytheist and trusty Wynette, who
never tires of showing what a good thing she was
for last Caulfield Cup. Crowdennis revealed his
speed for a few furlongs before his condition, seem-
i ugly, found him out, whilst Back wood ran con-
spicuously badly throughout. Certainly there was no
support for Baekwood, but if this exhibition was
in accordance with the present condition of the dis-
appointing English horse, what chance can he possibly
have of winning an Australian Cup a fortnight later?
For that matter the performance of El Dorado in the
Bond Cup was discouraging, whilst the figuring of
Havhope among the also-rans caused punters to
wonder once again whether Samuel Hordern’s pretty
little imported mare is ever going to earn oats on
the racecourse.
Prince Bardolph’s brother, Barosea, much
brighter in appearance than the ragged animal that
raced at Christmas time, made a one-horse affair
of the 11-furlongs Warwick Handicap at Randwiek
on Saturday. Murky Night was favorite, but little
r lelder couldn’t induce the handsome imported horse
to do his best, and two third-raters, Carmray and
Lien Song, were in the places, though neither ever
looked like overhauling the flying leader. Barosea
went out at 10 to 1 (he paid £5 Is. 6d. for 10s.
on the three-divs. machine), and was the third out-
sider to gratify Dynamiteodds. One of the others
—John Brown’s two-year-old Leslie Wallace —was
or 25 to 1, no takers, in the ring, but a' few speckers
collected a £lO 6s. dividend cn the tote. An
aristocratic chestnut by Wallace Isinglass—Countess

was reached he cleared out from the big field
(there were 24 starters), and won by five lengths
in uncommonly fast time —lmin. 7ssec. for the
furlongs. Hitherto the progeny of Wallace Isinglass
have done little good over a distance, but this fellow
may conceivably furnish into a Derby colt.
“0.K.”: The tape-measure notwithstand-
ing, results of races along the “straight six” at
Flemington continue to suggest that horses which draw
high numbers have an advantage over those travelling
on the more beaten tracks. The Stcndish Handicap
flutter on January 1 was another triumph for the
under-the-judge’s-box division. On paper there is
nothing in the draw for positions when*the course is
broad, and straight, but to punters in general the
gees on the side nearest the lawn seem to finish with
a greater rattle than those on the far side, next to
the Flat. Perhaps the going is firmer from the time
when they enter the course proper. It is hard to
see how the V.R.C. can assure as good going on the
much-used side of the track as on the side which
is hardly used at all except in 6-furlong races. On
wet days the cut-up condition of the turf by the
inside rails is glaringly apparent. When three or
four of the slickest sprinters draw, each of them, an
“over-20” marble, the winner is pretty certain to
finish under the judge’s box. Starting prices on
the Newmarket are influenced by the marbles, especi-
ally if there be a lot of rain about. A natural
straightgoer, like old Blue Cross, must necessarily
have a fair advantage over such as incline to bear
out, or bear in, or wobble; for one of these, of
course, a position next to the rails is a great
straightener. The best of luck in the draw is that
of the highest-numbered horse whose only weakness
is a disposition to bear towards his right,' where the
rails keep him from following his bent.
“Fax”: The highest aggregate of weight
ever placed in a Newmarket was in Cetigne’s year
(1918), when the winner and runner-up carried 9st.,
and the third horse humped 9st. 71b. But in a
general way weight tells considerably in the un-
ceasing struggle of the sprinters. Seven-stun-eight
is the lightest winning weight registered in the last
10 years, but the history of the helter-skelter records
nothing higher than Soultline’s 9st. 111 b. in 1909,
and Soultline took 3!sec. longer over the job than
Sunburst last year. On figures it is safest to look
for a Newmarket winner among the 7-stoners. In
the Australian Cup the topweights have been clean
out of it for the past 10 years. The highest to be
placed was Wishing Cap, a plodder, who' ran second
two years running, with 7st. 91b. and Bst. 51b.
respectively. In the 2}-miles handicap the odds
are heavily in favor of the 7-stoners. Prophets who
give a good show to The Rover, because he is a
great stayer, seem to forget that he had only 7st.
21b. aboard when he ran away with the race three
years ago. Nowadays the ones that might possibly
bear a big burden to the fore are usually kept back
for Sydney Cup.
“Mel”: “We don’t get the skinners now
that we used to get in the old days,” said the
bookie regretfully. “I was fieldin’ on the flat at
Flemington the day John White’s Chester won the
Derby (he won the Cup, too, you remember). A
mate and I put a fiver
each into the bag, and
that kept us going all
through the meetin’.
Ette de Mestre had a
colt named Vulcan in
the Maribyrnong Plate.
Somehow or other,
Vulcan’s name was left
off the card. They
knew all about it in-
side, and Vulcan was
well in the bettin’;
but on the flat we
didn’t know it was in
the race. There was a
big field —about 27 or
28, I think ; and when
Vulcan rolled home we
had the whole bagful
to ourselves. Of
course, it was all
silver bettin’, and
small stuff at that;
but the skinner was
worth about 15 quid to
us. Money from home.”
MOON, prominent
cross-country
jockey.
The Hobart Cup, like the bauble at Laun-
ceston, was won this year by an old stager that
used to run with indifferent success at Randwick
—in this case, Llanthony, by Land of Song—Mar-
celle. Carrying Bst. 101 b. "he gave a stone and
a beating to Royal Mattan, and returned his backers
£6 16s. 6d. for every 10s. staked; Sverre, with the
welter w r eight of 9st. 91b., was third. Llanthony’s
best performance in Sydney was a close second to
the ill-fated Furious in a mile handicap at Warwick
Farm. He was a pretty good horse that day.
“Yet”: A race meeting at Dereel (Vic.)
was dragged out for two hours beyond schedule
time so as to give the refreshment booth a chance.
The last event was run off at 7.30 p.m., amidst
the bottled-up indignation of those who hadn’t
wanted more beer.
* * * *
Money for the expenses of the Olympic
Games team has been rolling in briskly the last
week or two. N. S. Wales, which was very back-
ward until recently, has now reached its quota
(£4000), and if other States put on a spurt the
full amount of £ 10,000 should be collected. In the
past, for one reason and another, Australia has never
been adequately' represented at these Games, which,
in normal times, are held every fourth year in a
representative city. This year it has material for
a first-class combination. Barring accidents, Carr
will take no end of beating in the 100 and 200
metres. At Gothenburg last year he ran 100 metres
in 10 9-10 sec. and 200 in 21 9-10 sec
and 7-10seC. faster respectively than the winning-
times at Antwerp in 1920 and London in 1908.
Dr. Honner’s broad jump at Hobart (23ft. 9in.)
was 3Jin. better than the winning effort at Antwerp.
A. W. Winter’s best hop, step and jump (49ft.
8-Jin.) has never been equalled at the Games. Weis-
muller can probably swim a furlcng faster tlian
Charlton, but it is doubtful if anyone breathing will
defeat the “Uo.v” at 440 yards, 880 yards and a
mile. The A.I.P. crew showed that Australian
oarsmen can hold their own with the best in Europe,
and Bull is the sort of sculler who might do any-
thing. And there is Braneourt, the heavyweight
boxer. He is tall and heavy enough to punch his
way through a forest of opponents.
“Percy Pawnticket”: Olympic Fund officials ' in
Sydney are, wondering how to class a tattered old
gentleman who called to see them when the campaign
for the N.S.W. quota was young —whether as a
plain joker or a solemn person with no sense of
humor. He spoke with a fine enthusiasm about
sport and “the Reputation of this Commonwealth,”
and said that the Great Heart of the" Sporting Public
(his style of oratory makes capitals necessary)
would see that Australia was represented at the
Games. “Five Thousand Pounds is hardly worth
talking about,” he declared. “I will show you a way
in which all difficulties can be overcome.” The
officials began taxing their wits to recall if any
Sydney millionaire looked as though his clothes had
come from a second-hand shop. “I am prepared,”
he continued, in his grand manner, “to give three-
pence, if you can induce 400,000 others to do like-
wise. That makes threepence over the £5OOO
required.” Then he stalked out of the office with
the air of one who has made his country’s honor
safe, having left a grocer’s bill to indicate his
address.
In the 1360-yards championship of Aus-
tralia, at St. Kilda (Vic.) baths, Beaurepaire beat
Borg by a yard in 18min. 8 3-ssec. —rather slow
time. The competitors turned on a rope instead
of wood or stone; but for that the Swede, as
“Bogey” manfully admitted, would have been a
comfortable winner, as he lost about two yards at
each of the 13 turns. However, the old champion
proved that there is still a kick in him when the
conditions are to his liking. He is not as good as
he was when he beat Harris and Langer over the
same stretch, of water, but that is hardly to be
expected ; it is just on 16 years since he carried off
the 220 yards, 440 yards, half-mile and mile cham-
pionships of England. In a keenly-contested race
for the Vic. breast-stroke title, Les Uren beat
Soussari, the Queenslander, by a touch —a capital
performance, for Soussari is undoubtedly a good man.
* * * *
With Anderson out of the home team, and
O’Hara Wood, Mclnnes, Hawkes and Miss Boyd miss-
ing from the Victorians, the N. S. Wales L.T.A.
charged 6s. for a reserved seat at the inter-State
tennis match, and 4s. for an “unreserved.” It was
extortion in cold blood. Lawn tennis is now played
by thousands of young office-workers to whom every
shilling is a consideration. A wise management
would have some regard for these small-salaried
colts and fillies, move especially as the N.S.W. Cricket
Association asks only 3s. and Is. 6d. for inter-State
and Test matches alike. But the controlling bodies
in at least two States ■ have become demoralised by
Davis Cup profits, and the game is now of less
importance than the “gate.” In point of fact, the
entertainment provided at the White City would
have been dear at 2s. and Is. It would be a compli-
ment to some of the visitors to call them third-
raters, and Patterson was rarely at his top. He and
Schlesinger were beaten in the doubles by Kalms
and J. Willard, and the N. S. Wales representatives
triumphed easily—the men by 15 rubbers to 6;
the women by 11 to 1.
“15-30”: Patterson must have been very much
off his game when he had to fight hard for the
decision against the miniature Willard. In Melbourne
I saw Willard pushed to five sets by a comparative
second-rater, after the latter had emerged from a
gruelling doubles match on the same day. The
little Ma Stater has more heart than talent, and his
lack of a first-rate equipment of strokes will never
be overcome whilst he depends on his active legs to
get him out of awkward situations. All these colts
rely too much cn speed, to the detriment of place-
playing. Their service degenerates into a routine
of a fairly fast first ball without much guile about
jt, followed by a sickly second that calls for instant
punishment. In the ground play they are merely
content to keep the ball in motion, using up their
wind instead of practising to catch their oppenmt
with the unexpected shot, which is always more than
a point winner, because it affects the enemy’s morale.
Brookes is now regarded as a back number, but I
invite these youngsters to consider the methods by
which the champion rose to fame. His dictum that
a well-placed ball is worth a thousand brainless
slogs is sound enough for any ambitious beginner
to follow.
* * * *
Against the advice of its selectors, Norman
Brookes, R. V. Thomas and T. H. Hicks, the
council of the A.L.T.A. has decided to send Patter-
son, O’Hara Wood, Schlesinger and Kalms on another
hopeless Davis Cup mission. Anderson can’t go
and Brookes isn't keen on playing in doubles with-
out J.O. as a partner; Hawkes and Mclnnes are
also unavailable. This pursuit of the Davis Cup has
become a means of collecting fat dividends and,
incidentally, of withdrawing four able-bodied young
men from their presumably useful occupations and
keeping them unemployed for nearly half the year.
Far better sportsmanship would have been shown
by cutting out the Davis Cup business for one year
and sending two or three cracks to France as part
of the Olympic Games contingent. But the tennis
authorities fell heavily on that proposal. There
will be no distribution of profits at Paris.

If Les Murray (M.L.) hadn’t been mnscle-
bound, and if Earl France (U.S.A.) had had another
month’s training, and if the Yank had ever learned
to box, and if he hadn’t twisted an ankle in the
sixth round, the crowd at the Sydney Stadium on
Saturday might have seen a mill that was worth
the money. As it was, except for a spasm of fight-
ing in the third, when France looked like stopping
his man, the thing was tedious, and the American
was the only one in the hall who looked disappointed
when the referee disqualified him for going down
without a blow. It was bad policy to match t-vo
strangers in a strange land. Murray should have been
pitted against Demskv or -the younger Uren, and
France might have been kept on ice for a few weeks
longer. He can evidently fight a bit, although he
can’t box.
* * * *
“Trevedee”: Two regular patrons of the
ten-bob seats at Melbourne Stadium haven’t seen a
fight for years. They are stone blind. All the
same, their yells of encouragement or reproof to
the combatants (“The left, lad.... Don’t hang on
. . . .Get him with the right”) are as loud as those
of any brace of one-eyed barrackers in the building.
“Elgar” : I had an idea of taking up golf
as a hobby till I inspected the Elsternwick (Vic.)
club’s new links at Heatherton. The links consist of
147 acres of heath and'scrub just east of the Consump-
tive Sanatorium and behind the Benevolent Asylum,
and cost close cn £BO an acre. About 25 men are
engaged in getting the ground ready, planting buffalo
grass and constructing bunkers, putties, mashies and
cockieleekies —I think that is what you call them.
A mile of 4in. main is to be laid from the B. of
Works’ Moorabbin main, the links are to be threaded
with 2in. pipes and the clubhouse (there is to be
a supervisor’s cottage also) will cost £5OOO. The
entrance fee is a mere £lOO, and the subscription
£2O per annum. I am sticking to ping-pong.
ELLIS, the Vic. wicket-Keeper. He played
a fine innings at Adelaide.
Ponsford’s sequence of big scores was
broken in the second Vic.-S.A. match at Adelaide,
where Heath, the left-hander, got him for a “blob.”
But Woodful (62), Willis' (61), Hartkopf (99), Liddi-
cutt (73) and Ellis, the wicketkeeper (94), rose to
the occasion, and an innings much interrupted by
rain (the wicket played easily on the whole) closed
for 454. Arthur Richardson (32), Murray (23),
and Pritchard (43 n. 0.) gave the Croweaters a pretty
good start, but they were poorly supported, and the
side drifted into a hopeless plight.
A. V. Haddrick, formerly an umpire in
inter-State matches, lias published an analysis of
Adelaide batsmen, which shows that there are only
five possessing “sound defence, which is. the basis
of a class batsman.” The others, he says, are all
attack, which is good enough against the weak local
bowling, but fails when something better is met.
His “class” batsmen are, besides the two Richardsons,
Rundell and Dolling (both in the veteran stage,
though still very useful), and J. T. Murray. The
last-named, who first played for S.A. in 1912, and
was a member of the A.I.P. XI in England, is having
a great season with the bat, and his bowling has
come along astonishingly of late.
* * * *
“Trekle” : Northcote (Vie), with Hartkopf,
Carroll, Yeomans, Woodbury, Gibaud, and others,
had an excellent batting side, but badly needed
bowlers to rest Harty and Woodbury. To strengthen
this department they gave Charlesworth a chance to
send down thunderbolts, and straightway he justi-
fied his inclusion by making, in three hits, 70,
against Essendon ; 40 not out, against Collingwood ;
and 138 not out against South Melbourne—average
248. Also, he took 5 S. Melb. wickets for 19. He
is a recruit from the Police team and could fight
heavyweight. But he is on the wrong side of 30,
unfortunately.
“Tren” : Frank Tarrant, the Victorian who
went to England about 20 years ago a moderate
cricketer, and became the best all-rounder in the
land, is home again and will play a match or two
for Collingwood. Now 43, and out of the game
since the beginning of the war, he is not likely to
pick up his best form, but with Middlesex he was
a giant. From 1907 to 1914 —eight consecutive
seasons —he made 1000 runs and took 100 wickets, his
best figures being 183 wickets in 1907 and 2030
runs in 1911. In 1907 he returned to Melbourne
for a few months, and, pressed into the Victorian
team, made 107 against South Aus. and 206 against
N. S. Wales. As a bowler, however, he was un-
successful ; the hard wiekets did not suit him.
* * * «
“Centurion”: “Sammas” tells a story (B.
14/2/’24) of an umpire who gave a batsman out
as the result of a rotten bit of trickery on the
wicket-keeper’s part. That umpire should have had
his ticket cancelled. It is a fundamental rule of
the game that a batsman in such circumstances
shall be ruled not out. I once played in Brisbane
against a stumper whose practice was to indulge
in loud and unceasing criticism of the striker’s
play. My batting partner, stung to exasperation,
woodened the offender with his bat. The fielding
side conceded that he had received ample provoca-
tion and nothing more was heard of the matter. The
’keeper, a one-time inter-State man, did not appear
for his club again.
“J.H.” (London) : F. T. Mann having
proved a dismal failure, there is a move to appoint
A. E. R. Gilligan, Cambridge and Sussex, captain
of All England. To attain this position you must,
of course, be a Gentleman. Were Percy Fender a
Gentleman he would have succeeded Douglas long
ago. But he happens to be merely a gentleman,
meaning that he is not in the inner circle of English
cricket aristocracy; therefore the old fogeys who
run the M.O.C. won’t have him on their minds. All
the same, Gilligan would fill the bill very well.
He is a magnificent fieldsman, a first-class fast bowler
and a solid bat, with a habit of getting runs when
they are needed. Best of all, he is a very good
fellow.
* * * *
“Loud”: A new way of scoring at bil-
liards has been tried in a match between Newman
and Tothill. The break which a player may hope
to make when in form is carefully calculated ; when
he reaches it, he scores 1, and stops. In this case
Newman was assessed at 200, and Tothill at 125.
The sporting writers almost unanimously poke fun
at the idea, as discouraging consistency.' The un-
certain player scores occasional points, while (for
instance) Newman’s steady piling up of 150 or ISO
goes without any reward whatever.
THE LURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The A.L.T.A. Council has decided at the last
moment to send a team to compete for the Davis
Cup. It is recognised that without Anderson its
chances of success are negligible, but the gate money
will be substantial.”
Off to the Land of Hooch, devoted band,
The home of shoe-peg oats and Yankee Doodle!
Scant chance of bringing back the Cup you stand
But still with any luck you ought to land
A goodly wad of boodle.
The champ, who might have put the team atop
Declines to shed his counter cuff's and collars.
Achilles-like he sulks, his tent a shop.
What odds? Albeit the Cup you may not cop
There still remain the dollars.
Think of the grounds your enterprise will pack,
The swaying stands where sports and patriots
mingle
To see their Tilden smash, their Johnson smack.
Why should you mind being walloped when your
whack
Is waiting of the jingle?
Is any trophy more than glittering trash ?
Mere laurel crowns will fade, however bosker,
Fame’s guerdons turn inexorably to ash;
The one exception is the ready cash,
The jack, the dough, the “Oscar.”
Forth then, O gallant four, and may the ” fates
Smile on you when confronting Yankee spankers!
What use conjecturing whether glory waits,
’Tis surely more material that the gates
Are certain to be bankers.

Adelaide Register has been taking a census. John

lin 65, and Caleb Page 67. All are still at work.
“My grandfather lived his life on the river Murray
in Victoria, South Australia.” —A serious character
in the new Eden Phillpotts novel, “The Red Red-
mayne,s.”
“F.L.H.”: The latest quarry of the U.S.A. book
collector is any early Mormon record. A recent
New York sale brought into notice a rarity entitled
“Proclamation! To the People of the Coasts and
Islands of the Pacific.” It was the first literary
effort of the Latter Day Saints in Australia, and
was published in Sydney in 1851. The 16-page
booklet cost its purchaser 410 dollars.
After 45 years on the Maryborough (Q.)
Chronicle, George Roberts has retired. He joined
the staff at 14, was editor at 26 and retained the
job until the other day. His chair goes to E. J.
Hatton, tlie local rep. of the Brisbane Courier, an
energetic person of 35, w T ho has been either president
or sec. of almost every Maryborough institution, has
stood twice for Parliament w'ithout getting within
sight of the top of the poll, and after being wounded
with the A.1.F., has worked well for his old mates
as district president of the returned Diggers’ league.
“Rex”: I made my worst blunder when I was
sub-editor of a N.S.W. provincial daily. A cable-
gram came through starting off: “Wreck Scilly
Bishop Lighthouse launched lifeboats thrilling
scenes rescue.” Of course every schoolboy knows
(or should) that Bishop Lighthouse is a fixture on
a rock off the Scilly Isles, but I took it to be an
ecclesiastic in gaiters and wrote up the message
accordingly, heading it-. “A Brave Bishop—Helps
to Save Shipwrecked Crew-.” The sub. of our reptile
contemporary was a Cornisliman, who knew all about
Bishop Lighthouse, and he didn’t forget to let me
know about it, too.
“Flicker”: The difference between “Catholic” and
“Roman Catholic” has recently been impressed on
Adelaide Advertiser. Canon Wise, of St. George’s,
highest of the High Church party in S. Aus., had a
number of visiting clergymen at his church, and
one “Father” Barclay lectured on “The Appeal of
the Catholic Faith against the Protestant Religion.”
The lecturer asserted, among other things, that the
Catholic faith appealed to people in a way that
Protestantism could never hope to do, and con-
cluded by looking forward to the time when “the
wnole world would be Catholic.” Unfortunately for
the Advertiser, the reporter or sub-editor or some-
one put “Roman” before every one of the rev.
gentleman’s “Catholics,” and the fat was in the fire.
The error was corrected in wild haste next morning,
but the Nonconformists and Low Churchmen are more
than ever convinced that Canon Wise -is really a
Jesuit, while the local R.C.’s are beaming at him in
a fraternal fashion. Every paper should have a
Religious Editor. Or two if it wants diversion.
“J.H.” (London) : One of the first results of the
new Rothermere-Beaverbrook Press Combine will
be a new London evening newspaper controlled and
run by the Unionist Party. Until Hulton took the
cash for it, the Evening Standard stood strongly
for the Conservatives. Now, with Beaverbrook con-
trolling 51 per cent, of it, and Rothermere 49 per
cent., nobody knows what it stands for, beyond that
it is fiercely anti-Baldwin. Fleet-street has it that
Beaverbrook hates Baldwin because the Prime Mini-
ster, refusing to follow the late Bonar Law’s lead,
firmly declined to allow Beaverbrook to act as
adviser-in-chief in the composition of his Cabinet,
while Rothermere hates him, not only because he has
declined to “take his hat off to France,” but also
because he has been coldly unresponsive to the
claims of Esmond Harmsworth (Rothermere’s heir)
to an under-secretaryship. Beaverbrook was going
to Australia and Japan this winter; but apparently
the political upset has changed his plans. At any
rate, he is booked now for southern U.S.A,
THE GREAT GOD PAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The great god Pan, reputed dead,
Has from his ancient homeland fled,
Disgusted, maybe, with the tricks
Of modern Dago politics.
Now Norman Lindsay and his elan
Have in our bush discovered Pan;
Though ordinary folk, alack,
Know but one Pan, and he is black.
But Pan, the Pommy, Norman swears,
The bush with wombats gaily shares.
He has forgot his ancient Greek;
The god our language now must speak.
He can be spied on any day,
According to the sleuth, MeCrae.
The great god Pan is dead? Not he!
His photograph in print you see!
In etching and in rhyme he comes,
This Dago god beneath the gums ;
And with him in his bacchanal
Come dryads, nymphs and centaurs all—•
Yes, Norman Lindsay clearly sees
This alien host beneath the trees;
The sacred precincts of the gum
Are littered up with foreign scum!
Remittance gods and satyrs shipped
To exile ’neath the eucalypt,
And niughty nymphs the bush invade,
And Bacchus roysters in the glade,
Despite the kookaburra’s laugh,
Imported wine they gaily quaff....
Away with all this Dago rout,
And let our Aussie gods come out!
For no intruding gods we need ;
Our centaurs and our nymphs we breed ;
And long our dryads we have known,
Delightful nymphs, and all home-grown !
Indigenous is every one,
i. ith fervent worship of our sun.
You poets, open purblind eyes—
Our nymphs and dryads recognise!
Our nymphs each lunch-hour you may meet
In laughing groups in every street,
Gay nymphs in flimsy garments clad,
No thicker than the Greek cn'-s had,
These flapper nymphs so sweetly slim
And brown of face and long of limb,
With chatter high and childish jests,
And budding and innocuous breasts!
If centaurs you would see, MeCrae,
You'll come across them every da.v.
An Aussie mounted on his horse
Is but a centaur proud, of course.
Go, draw him, Norman Lindsay, please!
There are few centaurs such as these!
.' nd write songs to the centaur-bloke,
The lean Australian on his moke!
God Pan is easily in reach:
Just take a trip to Manly beach.
It will indeed be very odd
If you don’t recognise this god.
Ah, blind is he who careless cons
This statue made of sun-kissed bronze!
No godhead do you see in him,
This big life-saver chap called Jim?
So, poet, artist, you must give
Glad thanks that here our own gods lice,
Where centaurs gallop ’neath the trees,
And Pitt-street has its deities,
And all the land is over-run
With ancient worship of the sun,
Where street and strand are sacred, trod
By lissom nymph and surfing god !

“Othello,” at Melbourne King’s, judging
from a bewildering advt. in the local dailies,
is likely to keep Oscar Asche blacking his
face for longer than the 12 nights originally
promised, yet the indefiniteness of the new
announcement seems to leave the manage-
ment at liberty to alter its arrangements
before Saturday. Anyhow, “Othello” has
awakened Melbourne’s literary susceptibili-
ties, and the old, old story of how Desde-
mona fell victim to a mixed marriage is
getting the attention it deserves. The per-
formance, as a whole, may be most pleasing
to the youthful population that has grown
up since Asche first staged the tragedy in
Australia, but to the world that remembers
the same Moor as a lighter weight there is
much interest in noting not only some differ-
ences in production but also a considerable
gain of strength in the interpretation of the
name-part. Increased experience waits upon
increased bulk in Oscar Othello’s manner
of addressing the Senate and listening to
lago. Also he falls dead with a more pio-
found thud than of old, after uttering his
last dying speech and confession with a
world of despairing grief. His death scene
is a thrilling effort in histrionics. The sin-
cerity with which he calls himself names
commends him to one’s best commiseration,
although his murderous outbreak of jealousy
has previously persuaded all thinking per-
sons that the Moor is a noisy argument in
favor of the White Australia policy.

“Aladdin” is to-night (Thursday), after
which Ada Reeve and the rest of the panto'
Will go touring. Ada, out of the bill some
time last week, was equal to two re-appear-
arices last Saturday. With the panto, off

the Palace this Saturday. A new’ and beau-
teous leading lady and twm other strangers
from London will be included in an other-
wise Australian comedy company, and the
opening piece will be “The Man in Dress
Clothes.”
“Sally” stays at Melbourne Royal for her
last nights instead of shifting to Her
Majesty’s in accordance with previous state-
ments. ’ This is “Sally’s” 15th month, it
seems. In searching for reasons for the
exceptional popularity of a conventional
musical comedy, it is only fair to look tor
human interest in the furious German gentle-
man who identifies Sally at the garden fete
as his long-lost dish-washer, and denounces
the Russian prince as the rottenest waiter
his restaurant ever knew. Audiences love
a morsel of unexpected melodrama, and the
furious, foreigner in this case is so intensely
melodramatic that he cannot hold himself
upright. He bows his head, as it were, to’
the storm of his own indignation.
At Melbourne Princess’s the boys are still
mad about Nellie, the daughter of officer
Kelly. Moreover, that pure-minded offspring
of a cheery old police-inspector continues to
prefer her faithful bloke to a highly respect-
able young millionaire. The story of “Little
Nellie Kelly” lays much flattering unction
to the soul of womankind. Not an easy
story to swallow, it is sweetly ticklesome to
the feminine palate. And there are other
things in “Nellie” than the plot. There’s a
chorus that never grows weary and a June
Roberts who has danced her way into as
many hearts as Mamie Watson has smiled
herself into.
Hoyt’s have unleashed “Penrod and Sam”
in Melbourne this week, and the joyous yarn
is a pleasure to see. The nippers who play
the name-parts have the air of spontaneously
enjoying the frolic. There is also some
humor in “Out of Luck,” the yarn of a cow-
puncher who joined the Navy to dodge an
expected charge of homicide. At the Gaiety
“A Chapter in Her Life” lays bare two
human hearts, and shows that both are 24-
carat. At the Majestic the female who tries
to make a man of her husband is becoming
a lntbit. The latest missionary effort is put
up by a gorgeously-gowned lady in “The
Truth About Wives.” A bootlegger’s certi-
ficate of character should be handed to the
supporting fiction, “Lily of the Alley,”
wherein a lydy with a drunken father chances
marriage with a lad who has also been the
last out at closing time. At the Britannia
the multitude sees the twilight of an oid
idol in Matheson Lang playing Dick Turpin.
Talc powder and lip salve are heavily re-
quisitioned by the party of sirens in “The
Daring Years” at the Melba. Mildred Harris
is the worceau of the bill, embellished by
artistic dressing.
“Mis’ Nell o’ New Orleans” came across
to Sydney Criterion on Saturday: and an
entertaining person she proved to be in the
pretty bubble that Lawrence Eyre has blown
about her and her heartache of 25 years ago.
Romance is the strong flavor of the story,
with Tragedy whirled from his sinister stroke
by Comedy in Columbine skirts —Comedy
with Just the suspicion of tears to make
her eyes the brighter. To understand the
play you must see Irene Vanbrugh as Nell
Daventry, the whimsical, big-hearted, clever
woman that 25 years have made rtl the slip
of a girl whom Georges Durant (C. M. Hal-
lard) jilted almost at the altar-steps. Dion
Boucicault, very likeable as Pere Clement,
is a gentle background for the Nell who
in her exile in Paris has learned to treat
every man as a hassock. Janet Eccles’s
Delphine is a stilted lass, and Martin
Walker, the fickle young lover, is a heavy-
weight Felix Durant.
At Her Majesty’s, Sydney, the Russia of
comic opera continues to provide a dazzling
background for “Sybil”—a Muscovy of grand
dukes and Guardsmen that “Ouida” might
have drawn, and beauteous ladies, alternately
clad in daintiest silks and heaviest furs, who
burst into song at every opportunity. Gladys
Moncrieff leads the furry choir; and Arthur
Stigant and Leslie Holland are most enter-
taining asses.
Emelie Polini as “De Luxe Annie” is de-
livering the goods at Sydney Royal to those
wdio like to get their teeth into something'
more substantial than musical revues and
bedroom plays. There are few actresses
nowadays with the Polini capacity for tense
emotion; and Frank Harvey’s work is always
conscientious and thorough.
Ivelleway and C-o. are the newcomers to
Sydney Tivoli, and put the violin to many
hitherto unknown uses. Their last bit,
“Alcoholic Blues,” in which neither artists
nor scenery can stand plumb, is as welcome
as a spring of iced lager in a dry land. Will
Hay and his pupils continue on their ento-
mological excursion; Jen Latona has some
new songs, and Chinko and Kaufman a box
of new juggling tricks. The McLeans are
still on their graceful rounds; and King
Henry VIII. divulges further matrimonial
secrets.
Francis X. Bushman, screen idol of the
misty past, has come back to Sliadowland.
At Sydney Lyceum, with Beverly Bane, his
wife, playing offsider, he appears in
“Modern Marriage,” a twisted structure on
jerry-laid foundations. The fill-up, “Lost
in a Big City,” advertises the importance of
a street directory. “Salomy Jane,” whom
the Globe harbors, is the sweetest bit of
fluff on a California gold-rush, and is there-
fore nat’rally able to keep the horny hands
of the rough miners off her beloved one.
Even the George-street trams that rattle past
Hoyt’s front door fall into silence when
“Thundering Dawn” is upon the calico. In
an effort to save his insolvent dad from
payin- out a farthing in the pound, the hero
follows the gleam of the almighty dollar to
faraway lands, where a native lass who
stands in his way is wiped out by a provi-
dential tidal wave. “Her Reputation,
Hoyt’s other magnet, gives yellow journal-
ism a rap. The Strand is offering a pair

of average-quality pictures, and the Crystal
Palace has “The White Rose” nodding in
the breeze from the electric fans—all about
a sanctimonious young man who did one of
the many things he ought not to have done,
and then turned his starched collar back to
front.
Two good shows in Adelaide have come
to an end. One was in the open air at
Austral Gardens, unkindly treated by the
coolest summer within the Oldest Inhabi-
tant’s memory. The Williamsonian open-
air show, at the Exhibition Gardens, con-
tinues joyfully. The other discontinued show
is Nellie Bramley’s, after a long season at
the Royal. She ended with an evening made
up of bits from “The Misleading Lady,”
“Madame X” and “Fair and Warmer,” dis-
playing the versatility which has been a fea-
ture of her season. Another stock co. re-
opens the Prince of Wales; Allan Wilkie,
with strong local backing, starts his Shaks-
peare season with the seldom-seen “Winter's
Tale.” Through all these changes, the
Majestic keeps on with a good variety show,
of which Rice and Elmar, bounding on the
trampoline, are now strengthening the ath-
letic side. In pictures Wallace Beery, at
West’s, shows Richard of the Lion-heart the
gross feeder and herd-doer which that hero
of romance probably was in real life; the
York has a well-hidden murder mysteiy,
“The Acquittal,” with a shipwreck to fol-
low- ; and Gloria Swanson, at Wondergraph,
as Bluebeard’s eighth wife, deserves to be
smacked, but is hugged instead —which is
the way of the world.
❖ >'fi *
Septimus Power’s mural tribute to the
Anzac spirit is fitted over the entrance to
the Technological Museum on the first floor
of_ the Melbourne National Gallery, where it
will miss 75 per cent, of the attention it
deserves. The position is obscure and badly
lit, while the heavy ornamental top-piece
of the Museum doorway has left the artist
a fragment of w-all space about lOin. deep
for an undecided panel, depicting two aero-
planes, which tries to bridge the pictorial
gulf between the right and left wings of the
decoration. However, inspecting the whole
from the centre of the Library stairway
opposite, one feels that Power has filled his
huge canvas with warlike interest without
losing the effect of a memorial design. In
the left section foreground Diggers are fill-
ing a huge camouflaged howitzer with mes-
sages of condolence for the faraway Hun.
Behind, the ruins of Ypres stand up in pale
sunlight, and a tank, attended by dim khaki
figures, is going out for a morning walk,
while the middle distance is devoted to a
peaceful string of Indian lancers headed by
a personage in a red staff cap. The other
side is less significant in the force of con-
trast. The foreground is covered by a party
of the Light Horse coming down a slope, and
two Cameliers in profile stand silhouetted
against the barren cliffs and rolling sand of
the Palestine desert. Here the artist’s
ability as an animal painter is most pro-
nounced, and the care-free nature of the Aus
tralians is illustrated by their easy, undis-
ciplined manner in the saddle. The only-
faults of drawing are visible in the anatomy
of a couple of gunners on the other side, and
considering that Power worked without
models, his achievement is brilliant.
From Gatesliead-on-Tyne, England:—
All the Diggers haven’t gone home. Eight of
them are touring the provincial halls with an all-
Australian revue titled “Issues.” Burlesque is their
strong suit, and the show is going well everywhere.

The Rouge-et-Noirs, whom many Australians will

not treated her as kindly as “Bulloak” (B.
7/2/’24) imagines. I saw her at the Edin-
burgh Empire last year. She is a giant com-
pared with that Tivoli midget, June Mills,
and she looks all her years. But she couldn't
give the Empire audience enough of “Sally
in Our Alley” and “Pucker Up and Smile.”
“Te Babarantiko” : American crockery and
glassware are frail things compared with the
American face. When some dashing female
heaves stone jars and similar utensils at the
heads of the villains attacking the hero, these
missiles invariably burst into small pieces
—in the pictures. On the other hand, in
almost any cinema-show you may see
Yankee candidates for some lady’s favor
chucking each other about like gutta-percha
balls, and wrecking every stick of furniture
on each other’s heads. The other night 1
saw the hero punch his opponent up some
steps, across a verandah, through a closed
door and head over heels into the midst of
the party given in honor of the lady for
whom the battle was fought. Yet when the
mill was over the chap who had received
most of the gunfire was still on deck preen-
ing himself for another dose, without a
dent in his face and with merely an artisti-
cally disarranged forelock.
“Hamfat” : James Beattie Fitzgerald, men-
tioned in late P.P. pars, once made a bit of
a rise by being associated with a theatrical
failure. The co.—a large one —had struggled
into Wellington (M.L.), and the nefarious
principals set it rehearsing new plays as
though a fresh start was in prospect, mean-
ing all the while to levant to Sydney. But
when their boat was well at sea, and they
were congratulating themselves on the suc-
cess of their plans, Fite was dug up by the
purser. He had stolen on board and gone
to sleep in a cabin empty of luggage. “See
the manager, my boy,” said Fitz in his grand
manner when asked for the ticket. The
manager denied that he knoo the feller or
anything about him. “Conduct me to the
villain,” roared Fite when the purser re-
appeared. Conducted he was, and eloquently

he denounced the faithless manager, who re-
peated that the actor was an utter stranger
—one, he added unpleasantly, who would be
all the better for a bath. The dispute at-
tracted other actors who chanced to be on
board. These were able to testify that they
had known Fite as a member of the busted
co. for months. - What is more, they took up
a collection which left the descendant of
Brian Boru £27 in credit after his passage
money and bar bill during the voyage had
been paid.

The "FACE POWDER
de Luxe"
“Royce Rolls”: O. Asche’s “Othello,” at
Melbourne King’s, differs from his original
Australian presentation in one vital particu-
lar. In the first version the Duke of Venice
and his Senators were ranged along the wall
on the prompt side, with the result that the
audience had a magnificent profile view of
the robust Moor speaking directly to the
“grave and reverend signiors.” In the pre-
sent instance the Duke sits on a throne in
mid-stage facing the auditorium, whilst the
Senators are ranged along each side, the re-
sult being that Asclie must sometimes turn
his back on the Duke in order to give the im-
pression of orr>ting to the assemblage. Inci-
dentally, also, the people in front see a good
deal of his dorsal regions when he is address-
ing the Duke. The murder of Desdemona is
as impressive as before, but it has been
robbed of its barbaric thrill by the conceal-
ment of the dagger which finishes off the
lady. Ten or more years ago a less robust
Asche used to stand over his moribund fiame
and slowly unsheath a curved and sinister
wmapon, the action being so realistic that a
shudder became vocalised into an unmistak-
able “Ugh!” every night it was done.
“Orb”: “Thersites” (B. 27/12/’23) stated
that Oscar Asche turned his back on the
Duke in “Othello.” That statement Mr.
Asche vehemently denied, being loyally sup-
ported by his Grace. Melbourne Argus
now attests (11/2/’24) that Oscar Othello’s
“speech to the ‘most potent, grave and rever-
end signiors’ is delivered almost entirely with
his back to the Duke.” Strangely enough,
the actor-manager has omitted to give the
Argus man the Lie Direct, a distinction
that belongs to “Thersites,” although he
occupied several inches of Argus space in
explaining to a correspondent why he stabs
Desdemona instead of smothering her.
“Plasmon” : Melba is to be Desdemona in
the production of “Othello” by her Grand
Opera Co. It may be argued whether a lady
verging on the sixties, and spacious to boot,
will content the eye in the Shakspearean
tragedy, even if the ear has nothing to com-
plain about. The physical qualities of an
opera singer are not to be ignored. Try to
visualise a sawn-off Italian tenor playing
Samson alongside a six-foot Delilah. Melba is
to do Carmen also—another questionable
decision. She certainly won’t be the baggage
that Calve presented—the Carmen that ex-
torted the unwilling admiration of Bernard
Shaw.
“0.K.”: Seymour Hicks candidly told
Melbourne’s Gaud Mayor that it was unpre-
cedented in his experience for an actor to
receive a civic welcome—another way of
saying that Australian theatrical managers
have Australian officialdom by the wool.
And it is true. Nowhere else' do high offi-
cials so cheapen themselves. Harry Lauder,
on his first visit to this country, remarked
that much fuss had been made of him in
America, but in the matter of public demon-
stration Australia took the cake.
“Thcrsites”: In a Sydney Sun interview
with Seymour Hicks —it came from Adel-
aide—the sprightly mummer was made to say
that he had drawn some good royalties for
melodramas “from the late Bland Holt.” I
had a letter from Bland recently, and he
dated it from an address no more remote
than Sunning Hill, Kew, Victoria. Hicks
opens in “The Man in Dress Clothes,” but.
he will probably do the “Christmas Carol”
in which he lias played Scrooge nearly 2000
times. Dan Leno used to tell a yarn of
Hicks’s Scrooge. A play was being selected
for Princess Maud’s birthday festivities, and
Scrooge was mentioned. “Ah,” said the
Duke of Fife, “Scrooge is funny, of course;
but we want something to make the children
laugh. What about Dan Leno?”
“Jamwood”: The Firm has sent another
contract over the water to Muriel Starr,
who will presumably take Emelie Polini’s
place in the company now appearing at Syd-
ney Royal. It will be Muriel’s third visit
to the Commonwealth. She has really done
more acting in this country than in her own:
she was little more than a novice when she
arrived in 1913 to play Margaret Taylor in
“Within the Law” and Jacqueline in
“Madame N.” In America her radiance was
dimmed by that of Frances Grant Starr, a
sister, I am told, and a very accomplished
actress in stock companies. Muriel married
an alert young man who affected green hats
and tight trousers (he was startlingly thin)
and travelled for chewing-gum. Why is it
that drummers are so successful with
actresses? One who did the altar-walk with
another Williamson luminary peddled pills.
MORE BARBAROUS.
NOSARIT: “The picture you sent atony for that art exhibition
a couple of weeks ago—did they hang it well?”
MAHLSTICK: “Hang it! Old man.—they lynched it!”
Line from Norman Campbell:—
“0. Blin” says (B. 14/2/’24) that Allan AVilkie
played Othello as a “burnt-cork counterfeit” which
reminded him of a nig-ger minstrel. Oddly enough, I
visited AVilkie in his dressing-room during a per-
formance of “Othello” to try to cadge from him
some of the light umber coloring which he used
for the Moor, and which seemed to withstand per-
spiration ; I wanted it for a Hindu character in a
Tivoli dramatic sketch I was perdoocing. AVilkie
told me that in Asia —particularly Ceylon—where
the niggers loved “Othello” because the leading man
was colored, their only complaint was that he wasn’t
black enough.
From Piccadilly Circus :
Joe Coyne is likely to have a part in a new
musical play to be produced at the Empire—
“Bamboula,” by Arthur AVimperis and Harry M.
Vernon. He is contemplating a second Australian
tour.
The Evening Standard asserts that “Australia has
been a fortunate place for many British players of
late.” Irene Vanbrugh and Gertrude Elliott “have
each had something like a triumphal progress,” and
Ascbe “scored an unmistakable success in ‘lris.’ ”
All this under the heading “Land of Fortune.”
Reviewing the new productions in 1923, the Daily
Telegraph gives pride of place to Flecker’s delight-
ful Oriental fantasy, “Hassan.” “Its great popular
success,” the reviewer unkindly adds, “shows that
the public can appreciate genuine beauty even after
three years of ‘Chu Chin Chow.’ ” .
■l. B. Fagan’s stage version of “Treasure Island”
is back in London for its second Christmas
season and is drawing crowded audiences, as indeed
it has been doing throughout the year in the pro-
vinces. Bourchier’s Long John Silver continues to
be the outstanding feature. Bourchier says that
both Henry Irving and Tree wanted the story drama-
tised, feeling that there was a play in it, but they
were dissuaded by their professional advisers, who
assured them that a piece without a heroine would
not stand the ghost of a chance in London. Fagan
and Bourchier are making these experts look foolish.
Bernard Shaw’s “Saint Joan” has been produced in
New York, and some of the critics hail it as his
greatest achievement. The performance extends over
four hours, but according to one account the first-
night audience didn’t notice the flight of time,
being “enthralled.”
“Pedro”: Being older than “Bulloak” fB.
7/2/'24), I recall Florrie Forde when she
was in a variety show given nightly, about
1891, in the big basement under the Arcadia
Arcade, Sydney, where later Joynton Smith
had a sodawater factory. Hiscocks was
billed as director of the human menagerie
in which Florrie and other semi-amateurs
pranced about singing “You should see me
dance the polka,” and giving a show of limb
which was considered very satisfying in those
days. Looking at her ample embonpoint
now, it is interesting to reflect that Florrie
was then supposed to be a t.b. and only on
earth for a short visit.
“Royce Rolls”: Freak productions of
Shakspeare seem to be commoner in America
than anywhere else, in Laurence Hutton’s
“Curiosities of the American Stage” quite
a crowd of female Hamlets are listed. One
of them, Charlotte Cushman, had a singular
fondness for male impersonation. Being
somewhat masculine, she did Romeo and
Cardinal Wolsey in addition to the Dane,
and the commen-
tator alleges that
she was as con-
vincing in the red
robes of the Car-
dinal as she was
under the high
stomacher of Cath-
erine of Aragon,
which she had pre-
viously played with
magnificent pathos.
A performance of
“As You Like It”
at Palmer’s
Theatre, New
York, in 1893, was
undertaken entirely
by the unfair sex :
a lusty young
Venus, Marion
Abbott, was
Charles the Wrest-
ler. Probably
there are many
American play-
goers who remem-
ber Edwin Booth
spoiling the peace
of mind of Othello
in English, whilst
the darkie roared
his jealousy in the
boiling Italian of
Salvini. But the
maddest jest of the
lot was the benefit
to George Rignold
at Booth’s
Theatre, New
York, in 1877,
when the beau-
teous hero acted
Romeo to seven
different Juliets,
the actress being
changed every
time Miss Capulet
took the stage.
Among the stars who appeared on the occa-
sion were the celebrated Adelaide Neilson
and the no less significant Fanny Davenport.
“Lond.” : Charles Walenn, the Gilbert-and-
Sullivan humorist well known in Australia
(his brother Gerald, the violinist, has just
been acquired by Sydney Conservatorium),
is playing lead in “The Private Secretary,”
revived as usual in London for Christmas.
“Charley’s Aunt” has also come back —it
spends all the rest of the year touring the
“provinces.” “When Knights were Boid”
has joined this hardy-annual list.
“Darlinghurst” : Norman Barrington, who
came to Australia with Lcyland Hodgson,
the Fuller-Ward baritone, and played char-
acter parts with Clay Smith and Lee White,
may be seen shortly in a J.C.W. production.
Barrington, a Londoner, served during the
Tigris campaign as a captain in the Somerset
Light Infantry. After the Mesopotamia
business he was a military magistrate in
Baroda, territory of the stout Gaekwar who
omitted to make the customary obeisance
at King George’s Durbar in 1911 (he pleaded
that he had housemaid’s knee, or something
of the sort), and has never been quite for-
given, even though one of his names is Sam.
That is to say, Sam Sher Bahadur, Farzand-i-
Khas-i-Dowlat-I-Inglishia.
“Hamer” : Bathurst lost its quaintest in-
habitant when Phil Creith died there at 71
a while back. Known to every travelling
showman as ‘ Gobo,” he had been Bathurst's
bellman for over 40 years, and had a stand-
ing challenge to the world to bell-ring all-
comers for £5O a-side. While “Maori Jack,”
of Orange, who made similar claims, was
alive, the pair used to breathe challenges at
one another, assisted by theatrical people
and travellers, who had the legs of the quaint
characters well extended. Once "Gobo w T as
taken by a travelling show to Orange and
sent out to announce its presence; where-
upon Maori Jack, bursting with indignation,
gave it an additional free ad. by going out
with his bell to exhort Orange not to patron-
ise a show that imported a foreign bellringer.
The pair were brought together in an alleged
“championship contest” by a crowd of jokers,
who found joy in their exasperation as each
match was solemnly proclaimed a draw.
Maori Jack was an ex-pug., and died some
years ago.
“P.X.” : A new book of "Idioms and Idio-
matic Phrases,” just published by Funk and
VVagnalls (New York), hasn’t any doubt
about the origin of “getting the bird.” It
quotes the London Graphic of April 10,
1886: “To be goosed, or, as it is sometimes
phrased, to get the big bird, is occasionally
a tribute to the actor's power of representing
villainy; but more often is disagreeably sug-
gestive of a failure to please.” Incidentally,
the editors quote “Spirit of the Times,” pub-
lished at Philadelphia, in 1842: "Chippen-
dale slept in the watch-house. Chippendale
is certainly a bird” — i.e., a peculiar or re-
markable person. The wan-d forgot to have
that meaning for over half a century, and
remembered it again only lately.
“Fax”: Among theatrical events which
are solemnly predicted and which never come
to pass is the removal of “Sally” to Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, after a long run at
the Royal. It was announced recently
under the heading “Sally’s New r Home.”
The lucky musical comedy was to be shifted
to Her Majesty’s on February 23, while
Grossmith filled the gap at the Royal. Two
or three days later J.C.W. discovered that
Maoriland was waiting for “Sally,” and
therefore she must remain at the Royal
another three weeks before leaving Mel-
bourne for good, while Grossmith did his
farewells at Her Majesty’s. Nowadays a
journal that publishes theatrical announce-
ments is kept busy contradicting them.
There is such a struggle after “publicity"
that those responsible for it drop in a few
lines to complaisant papers at the first men-
tion of a change. f Newspapers wouldn’t
allow themselves to be trifled with by ordi-
nary people. But rules made for ordinary
people don’t apply to showmen,
“Second Murderer”: While waiting for
the curtain to go up on “Rockets” I counted
the mentions on the programme of horn a
and Toots P'ounds. Lorn a was referred to
eight times, Toots ten times and the two
in association eight times—-261b. on a thrip-
penny programme. Their frocks, I w T as told,
came from Bond-street, London ; their hats
from London and Paris; their hosiery from
London; and their shoes from London and
Paris. The tailoring was from the Strand,
London; the uniforms from London; the
jazz and effects from London; luminous
effects from Paris. The girls themselves
came from Australia. But why drag Aus-
tralia in? The programme didn’t.
“B.”: One of the features of Flecker's
“Hassan” in London is a dance by a member
of the numerous Kelleway family. The dancer
is known to the clan as “Babe,” and as Leon
Jenkowski collaborated with Ivy Shilling in
Britain and America. Another sprightly
brother is the partner of Lydia Carne in the
London halls, and still another, Alex., who
had warbled in revues with George Robey in
the Smoke, has been collecting a good salary
from Harry Musgrove, jun. And there is
Cecil Kelleway, who was introduced to Aus-
tralia in “The Little Whopper,” which died
young, and who remained to give the country
a taste of his humor as Uncle Mathieu in an
Anglicised musical version of a French night
out, and in numerous other parts. Cecil is
the eldest of the brethren.
“Xamilc” : Discussion of what may happen
to persons during trances (B. 10/l/'24)
reminds me of a sleeping beauty I was
privileged to view at Charleville (Q.) Show.
Patrons entered a tent where a damsel osten-
sibly slumbered upon a couch, over which
a mosquito-net was tightly stretched. She
was glad in flesh-colored overall tights rein-
forced by a spray of artificial red roses at
the low-cut corsage, and a shawl carelessly
arranged where it would best placate the
censor. The gentleman who took our shil-
lings at the door assured us that she had
been asleep for three years. However, the
celerity with which the lady assumed a sit-
ting posture when a sozzled young grazier
cut the mosquito-net and pressed the point
of his penknife against her thigh was amaz-
ing, and the proficiency of her vocabulary
still compels my admiration. The last I
saw of the entertainment was a blasphemous
“spruiker,” assisted by the beauty, very
wide awake and clad in a red dressing-gown,
hurling tent, couch and general effects on to
a waggonette preparatory to lighting out for
greener fields.
THE TOMTIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The war has left us, with few exceptions, a
rising generation of players with the technique of
tomtits, and a belief that they are perfectly equipped
simply because they are photographed once a week,
play indifferent golf during the day, and jazz per-
fectly at a supper-club.” —Seymour Hicks, m
“ Difficulties” his book.
. Strutter, whom I heave a book at,
Mark the information it conveys.
Flappers deem you good to look at,
Sentimental matrons voice your praise;
But your Seymour you trepan not—
He perceives the desolating fact;
Like a bard whose verses scan not,
Such you seem to me, for know, young man, you
cannot
Act!
Or the links your perfect knickers
Lend a kind of glory to your putts,
Though the impish caddie snickers,
Certain that you cannot golf for nuts;
Alcohol, in mug or rummer,
You, m3 r buck, absorb uncommon well;
And at jazzing you’re a hummer,
But (O shade of Kean!), regarded as a mummer —
Hell!
What avails the art of steering
Lumps of joy through fashionable hops,
If you set the critics jeering,
And the play incontinently flops ?
Dear to Gertie and Augusta
(Though a source of worry to the pit)—
“Sweet” as to Catullus his venusta
Sirmio —you are (theatrically) just a
Tit!

Combining flexibility and fleetness, power efficiency with dependability the new
CASE engine achieves what has hitherto been deemed impossible. Because of the
high standard of quality and workmanship 55 horsepower is economically delivered,
smoothly and without effort. Sturdy crankshaft bearings and good balance ensure
the elimination of critical speed vibration.
On all roads and grades smooth yet positive application of power is easily effected with the CASE-
built Multiple Dry Disc Clutch. This clutch is at least thirty per cent, oversize compared with
the average unit used in cars of equal power and weight. Gears may be shifted noiselessly and
the car put in motion without disturbing jerks. The large bearing surfaces of the eight gear type
plates, separated by heavy non-burn faces, ensure noiseless operation. The chassis of the
CASE Model Xis replete with many improved features. The sturdy frame completely protects
the body and power units from deflection and is calculated to give one hundred thousand miles
of severe service without showing signs of weakness.

Mombak: The tides of blood are again running
strong:—
The burglar softly crept,
On to the verandah he stept;
He went to the window which he undid
With a jemmy, which he hid ;
He dropped through the window, filled his bag
With so many things that it made it sag ;
Greedy for more, he pushed them down,
A spoon slipped through with a clattering sound ;
He stooped to pick it up, slipped with a crash
On to a table which he did smash.
The owner, waking from a pleasant dream
By hearing his wife shrilly scream,
He rushed through the door, revolver in paw,
Switched on the light, and the burglar he saw.
“Up with your hands, dishonest brute,
If you hesitate I’ll shoot.”
Trapped in that room, what should he do,
But stoop and throw an old shoe?
Ouick cn its heels came his bowie knife.
True to an inch, it took his life.

something, hut falls down before it gets out an
intelligent remark.... S.T. (Annandale) : Poor

Bellerive: Your idyllic mood is charming:—
Dilapidated old pants,
You’re beyond repair ;
Through calm and storm
Like a board you did wear;
Made of tough cloth,
For work and its strain,
You cost me a pound
And I can’t complain:
Too bursted and rent
For needle and thread,
You’ve* got to come down ,
From "the nail in the shed;
Out into the lane
Old pants you must go,

The ring yarn is ingenious enough, but not convinc-

’gainst my heart once more will lay” is the most
remarkable we have found at the close of any sonnet.

enough done. . . .L.E.J.: The publication has been
dead some years. But, frankly, it is still no deader

“N’lmporte”: It’s profitless to argue as to
who first discerned Queensland’s cotton pos-
sibilities. But here is an extract from Wals-
ford’s “Men of the Time” (1862 edition) :
“Sir George Bowen was appointed in 1859
Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of
the new Colony of Queensland, in Australia,
a district considerably to the north of Syd-
ney, and capable of becoming a great field
for the growing of cotton.”
“Top Rail”: Travelling to the N.S.W.
North Coast the other day I was tortured
throughout the trip by an atrocious picture
framed partly at my expense, and hung in
the carriage to assist tourists to appreciate
Australia. It was a photo of a stretch of
barren, rutted' road, with five cows, rears to
the camera, breaking the local council’s laws
by living in the ‘long paddock.” Why are
these ridiculous pictures hung in most of
our trains to depress travellers and dis-
courage tourists? On the Tweed or any
other of the coastal rivers there is enough
scenic magic to enchant every railway car-
riage in the country. It will stay there, too,
while the Commissioners send out photo-
graphers who appear to regard the stern of
a cow as beautiful or interesting.

Do you know that in less than ten minutes
you can double the beauty of your hair? It be-
comes light, wavy, fluffy, abundant and appears
as soft, lustrous and charming as anyone could
desire, after a simple wash with Rexona Soap.
A delightful surprise awaits those whose hair has
been neglected, or is scraggy, dry, brittle or thin.
Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust,
dirt or excess oil, and in a few moments you have
doubled the beauty of your hair. Rexona Soap
dissolves every particle of dandruff, cleanses,
purifies and invigorates the scalp, for ever stop-
ping itching and falling hair. If you care to have
pretty hair, and lots of it, get a tablet of Rexona
Soap to-day.
Shampoo it with
Rexona Soap
To shampoo or wash the hair with Rexona
Soap is an easy task, but the results are startling.
It leaves the hair in such a beautiful condition, the
scalp perfectly clean and wholesome. The hair
becomes light and fluffy, waving
about the face in abundance, as
beautiful hair should always
appear. Rexona Soap leaves a
delicate perfume, invigorating the
roots of the hair, which prevents
greyness. A few shampoos with
Rexona Soap effectively removes
every trace of dandruff or loose
and falling hair. Ladies who use
it for the hair say that Rexona
Soap is far better than any of the
so-called hair tonics.

Insects are
Unpleasant
Company—
\
they are not particular
whether they tease the
cat, torment the baby, or
bite father.
Insects are not fussy about their
habits or their place of abode.
They revel in filth, and, for the
good of mankind, such dissemi-
nators of disease should be
mercilessly destroyed; and the
easiest and surest way is by the
use of
Kruses
Insecticide
The beauty about this remarkable
destructor of noxious insects is
that it is quite harmless to poultry
and domestic pets, but with Fleas,
Flies, Ants, Bugs, Cockroaches,
Mosquitoes, Moths, etc,, one puff
means sudden death.
One tin of the genuine Kruse’s
Insecticide, intelligently used, vyill
keep a house free from Insects
for months. It is the most
economical and effective exter-
minator of insect pests obtainable.
Insist on getting the original and
genuine Kruse’s—lt never fails.

“C.G.”: A new industry has sprung into
existence in Queensland, following the Pear
Commission’s report—pear poisoners are at
work in practically every part of the State
where the pest grows. Some of them are
experts, and some of them are brums who
had previously never seen a pear poisoned in
their lives. But they are all earning some-
thing, and some are making good money. To
judge from the advertisements in western
papers there are still chances galore for men
who are willing to tackle the job.

“Adelaide”: Some of our leading book-
shops are readjusting themselves. Harvey
took over from Wigg and Son in Bundle-
street two years ago, when that firm (mostly
Davidsons —there has not been a Wigg in it
for years) decided to concentrate on whole-
sale stationery. Harvey is now handing over
to Cole’s Book Arcade (really the brothers
Beck), who move in from the other side of
the street. Also Rigby’s (which is now,
as a fact, J. M. Bath) retires from King
William-street into a warehouse behind
which Sandford and Co.’s produce store used
to be.
* * * *
“Sturt” : Just half a century ago the City
Council of Adelaide leased out all the acre
on which the Town Hall stands except that
required for the building itself. The lease
of the hotel on the south side ended long ago;
the rest has only just run out. Way (after-
wards Chief Justice), Arthur Blyth (after-
wards Agent-General) and Henry Scott
built Eagle Chambers and Gladstone Cham-
bers on the Pirie-street corner; and this
valuable property now automatically be-
comes the Corporation’s.
* * * *
“H.M.” : Near Barrington Tops (N.S.W.),
a place which is being assiduously boomed as
a tourist resort, lives an unusual kind of
artist. He works in wood mosaic, producing
inlaid table-tops, sticks and other articles
from native timbers. Life-like representa-
tions of birds arc included in his handiwork.
The old chap has been discovered by one or
two city firms, which retail his work, but no
inducement has succeeded in luring him from
his bush home. He never allows anyone to
see him in the intricate phases of his work,
and only recently has he adopted an ap-
prentice—his nephew. A bygone N.S.W.
Governor gave him commissions, and the
King has specimens of his work.
“B. Y. Law”: “0.K.” (B. 10/l/’24) is
quite right in his statement that an English
chocolate firm about to begin operations in
Australia got its manufacturing machinery
in free of duty, but his next remark that an
Australian manufacturer of the same commo-
dity would certainly have to pay duty had he
imported British machinery suggests that
he has not read the Custom.; Tariff. Neither
manufacturer would pay duty if the
machinery was of U.K. origin, and entered as
such. Tariff Item 174 deals with “machines,
machine tools and appliances, as prescribed
by departmental by-laws,” and the rates are
free (U.K.) and 10 per cent, (general).
Most of the manufacturing machinery which
comes overseas to Australia is admitted by
the Customs under this item.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: Deep down in the cellar
of a Brisbane bonded store are a number
of drums containing 919 gallons of vodka.
The stuff was landed many years ago to tne
•order of several naturalised Russians, who
still had a hankering after their national
spirit, but they jibbed at the stiff duty—43s.
per gallon. Since then the stuff has lain
untouched, with every opportunity of be-
coming matured and mellow. The other day
the Customs people decided to try to sell
it, together with various other things on
which duty was payable. Owing to the size
of the containers it was impossible to bring
all the vodka to the sale, but a sample bottle
and a glass were there for anybody wishing
to taste the stuff. There were several Rus-
sians present, but not a single person came
forward to test the liquor, nor were ariy
bids received for it. Another attempt is to
be made to dispose of the spirit, but it is
unlikely that anyone will be willing to pay
the required duty, which is just under £2OOO,
and the chances are that in the end it will
be poured into the sea.
THE MILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Beside the road to lvurrawang,
Deserted now, and still,
With broken doors and ruined walls
There stands an ivied mill.
Past use, its years of service done,
It drowses in the heat;
To it no more bronzed farmers come
'With sacks of golden wheat.
Gone are the four winds of the world
That stooped to give it power
To grind its stores of gracious grain
To soft and silken flour.
No more, rich-nurtured, round about
Wheat crops grow clean and high ;
The ploughed lands now are pasture lands —
Green-grassed the furrows lie.
No more, da}' long, at harvest time,
The millstones turn wind-sped,
To fill red ovens, near and far,
With fragrant loaves of bread.
Beside the road to Kurrawang
One sees, in its decay,
That man and all things made by man
Are doomed to pass away.
Grist only, grist and nothing more,
Are deed and dream renowned;
And turning them to flower-like dust
The mills of Time go round.

About 1730, when the
famous Captain John
Crichton, late of the
11 Greys,” was over 80
years of age, he was
often seen on the arm
of Dean Swift. It was
he who persuaded this
worthy old soldier to
write his most interesting
memoirs, which were
published in 1731.
THE Cigarette which bears the name of the famous
"GREYS” regiment has made, and sustains, a
reputation among cigarettes that is second to
none for wholesomeness, purity and fragrance. It is
par excellence the comforting cigarette.

To gather the children around and listen to them singing
the nursery rhymes so dear to their hearts—to watch them dancing
with the sheer joy of being alive, inspired by the lilting strains of
a well-known dance piece—perhaps a hymn tune or a good-night
lullaby, and then—to happy dreams.
What unalloyed pleasure a
PALING
PLAYER PIANO
will bring to everyone who comes
witbin its charmed circle !
Father, stirred by youthful memories, sings a favorite song to
an accompaniment played on the Player Piano in such perfect tune
and with encouraging stimulus that he is pleasantly surprised to
find he “doesn’t sing such a bad song”—then one or two pieces
—a popular melody—and the evening has slipped by. Mother,
who has been listening and happily working, finds the monotony
of sewing temporarily lifted.
THIS IS NOT A FANCIFUL PICTURE

J. L. RAITH, Hon. Promoter,
495 a George Street, Sydney, N.S.W.
You might want their help to-morrow.
The new Inspector of Mines in S.A. is
John L. Pearson, latterly underground man-
ager at Wallaroo, with a wide experience of
silver at Broken Hill, of gold at Kalgoorlie
and Menzies, and of the red metal with the
Queensland Copper Co.
“H.K.”: Recent Bulletin mention of
H.M.S. Buffalo —the vessel that brought
South Australia's first Governor, Hindmarsh
—recalls that Glenelg’s mayoral chair is made
out of timber taken from the old cratt. lhe
landing was at Glenelg—then Holdfast Bay.
“F.G.S.” : Mention of banker H. L. Heron
(B. 24/l/’24) reminds me of his battered
son “Birdie,” who was a captain in my
battalion in the Big Scrap. He collected
an assortment of wounds and lost an ®y. e
on the Peninsula, and fought with the 59th
in France with a glass substitute.
“J.E.C.”: If a Tom Creer, mining man,
died in Adelaide the other day (B. 31/l/’24),
then there were two of his name and occupa-
tion. Our Tom Creer, aged 62, passed out
in St. John of God Hospital, Kalgoorlie, on
Jan. 21 —a man greatly respected in mining
circles, and manager of the Golden Hope at
the time of his death.
“Senojo”: An Adelaide electrician shook
hands with 15,000 volts that should not have
been on the circuit. He survived the intro-
duction ; but three of his fingers were welded
together. Surgical carpenters Successfully
separated one of them, but the other two
defied all their efforts. To-day the double
finger is in good working order and helps
to drive a Ford.
“Yarrum”: The most piece of
land in the now thriving town of Wollongong
(N.S.W.) —three acres in the very heart of
it—was bought in the early ’sixties from a
party named Taylor for a bottle of rum.
The vendor was the father of “Mulga” Tay-
lor, present Speaker of the W.A. Assembly.
I never heard how Taylor acquired.the land,
but it may have been for half a bottle.
“Cinquanteneuvifeme”: “G.R.” states (B.
24/l/’24) the most a very skilful diver
can remain under water without mechanical
means of respiration is four minutes. Four
minutes may be a man’s limit if he has to
work below water; but a few days ago, in
the swimming and diving championships at
Melbourne City Baths, Lola Scott remained
under water 4min. 35sec., and then only
came to the surface when a messenger was
sent down to her, apprehension being felt
for her safety.
“R.F.K.F.” hitches up his pants: —
Conor O’Brien’s 15,000-mile cruise from Dublin
to Melbourne in his 40-foot yawl has conferred on
him the press title of “a modern Cook.” Actually
his Seahorse is only one thirty-third of the tonnage
of the converted Whitby collier which Captain Cook
renamed the Endeavour in 1770. The Mayflower
waS only about half the Endeavour’s tonnage; and
of the three vessels that carried the Columbus party
across the Atlantic, the biggest (and only decked
one) was 63 feet from stem to stern. The 64-ton
motor-boat Speejacks, which made Australia part of
its world itinerary a couple of years ago, was sft.
longer than Columbus’s flagship.
“Pollio”: Sorry for “Cartot” (B.
24/l/’24), but the Emden was in the Lad-
rones. She escorted Yon Spee’s supply-ships
from Kiaotchaou to Pagan Island meet
the big cruisers, and was then detached with
orders to do just what she did do —barring
the final fight. “Cartot’s” trouble is that
he assumes the veracity of her first lieu-
tenant, who —as may be seen from his
account of the Sydney-Emden fight—was a
vigorous but extremely crude liar. As a
matter of fact, the noon position of the
Emden is known for every day of her cruise
from China to the Cocos.
“Rice” : In a shed in an Adelaide suburb,
George Sneyd, whose name is attached to
a saddle with a world-wide reputation, is
now trying to turn out the perfect article.
When he was in business at Mount Gambier
he received orders from England, India,
S.-W. Africa, and all parts of Australasia,
and since his retirement a couple of years
ago, at 71, he has been working on the new
bit of mounted equipment. The main idea
he embodies in it is in regard to the knee-
pads, or rather the absence of them, the
rider gripping with the inner part of the
leg just above the knee.
“H. Hardupp” : The monotony of the Syd-
ney bakers’ strike, which has been dragging
on for weeks (although nobody is going short
of bread and unionists are delivering most
of it), has been broken by a proposal to run
a co-operative bakery. It is the union’s own
fault that it does not possess one 15 years
old. In 190 S the Labor Council, then as
strong for voluntary co-operation as it is for
communism now, proposed to start a sheaf
of co-operative enterprises, beginning with a
grocery. Representatives of the dough-
punching trade demanded that a bakery
should be the first venture, and the council
gave them its blessing. Matters looked to be
shaping well, and there were hopes of get-
ting a Government building at Dawes Point
rent free, when the doughies made, a fresh
demand —“no machine baking.” This meant
putting such a handicap on. the undertaking
that the council dropped it, and it has re-
mained dropped.
“F.A.” passes through some old toll-gates:
A deputation to N.S.W. Premier Fuller has sug-
gested that to maintain the road over the Blue Moun-
tains (N.S.W.) the old toll system might be re-
introduced. The actual construction of the. road
over a century ago was a record in speed. The
labor was supplied by convicts in response to
a promise of emancipation for all who should be there
when the job was through. The gangs built the
track from Penrith to Bathurst in a shade under
six months; it was open for traffic in the middle
of January, 1815, the toll system providing the
revenue for maintenance. It fell into disrepair,
however, in the ’forties, and it required the forma-
tion of the Department of Roads in 1857 to secure
attention for this main artery. The opening of
the railway to Bathurst in ’76 dealt it a heavier
blow. In 1864 the freight per road had been reduced
to 74d. per ton-mile, but the railway soon cut
this "down to 3d. and to less than 2d. ten years
later. This was responsible for the transformation
of the western road from a commercial highway
into a tourist track. After the abolition of che
toll system in 1877, nobody bothered much about
the old path; even now apparently no one cares
much about it except motorists and the western
communities who are using it increasingly for goods-
haulage on account of the tremendous increase in
railway charges.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM type of singleness.
Dazzling breasts that never bless
With their bared surrendering
Amorous strengths that man may bring
To their conquest. They are free
As two wild white mares may be—
Two young mares that scream and rear
Should a stallion draw a-near —
Fierce as panthers, fair as doves,
Spurning yoke and curb of loves.
Loins and thighs and knees of snow
Never stress of love shall know.
As far mountain snows that lie
’Gainst a pallid, holy sky
By a fainting wanderer seen
From a midnight-dark ravine,
Spur his thirst and hurt his soul,
So I stand, the hopeless goal
Of the finite world’s desire.
All the flowers of noonday’s fire
Fade before my sovereign white
(Hueless hue of death’s delight).
Tallest lilies round my knees
In their pallor seem to freeze.
’Neath my huntress-sandalled feet
Bruis&d roses yield their sweet,
Like crushed hearts that redly wet
Love’s bare feet upon them set.
Am I crueller than love,
I, the god no prayer can move,
I. the buried fountain sealed,
I, the beauty unrevealed,
I, the vase of unlipped wine,
I, the never-entered shrine,
I. the smooth, unridden steed,
I. the untrodden mountain-mead
Thick with starry, virgin flowers.
Where the footless cliff uptowers?
Love’s keen feet are bloody-red ;
Round the fervent marriage-bed
Taloned roses, vine on vine,
Like fanged and lovely serpents twine —•
A bed of tears and fever-drouth,
Striving limbs and sobbing mouth,
Famished flame and slain desire,
And the muted Orphic lyre.
Have I offered bitter bread?
Though your hungers are unfed,
Though my feet you still pursue
Through the glimmering leagues of dew,
Wonder is the wood before you,
Beauty is the planet o’er you.
Only to Endymion dead
Did I bow my long-tressed head,
Sealed his eyelids with the kiss
Of inviolate Artemis.
I. the immortal dream that flies
Ever from life-dazzled eyes,
I, the joy forever sought,
I. the quarry never caught—•
Silver bird or pallid fawn
Fleeing through the dews of dawn—
I. the snow-white heart of heat
Where all colors fuse and meet;
I. the death wherein is life,
I. th’ unshaken core of strife —
When you grasp me, Hunter-soul,
God-like, you have grasped the whole!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MAJOR MORISSETT ruled at New-
castle in the year 1825, and did it
with a rod of iron.
Out towards the Coal Island (Nobby’s)
the breakwater was crawling, slowly
and painfully, across the little, turbulent,
tide-swept strait that formerly separated the
lump of sedimentary rock and coal-strata
from the mainland of Australia. Unhappy
men, driven like cattle.by brutal overseers —
who had no alternative but to be so under the
brutality of the most inhumane penal system
the British Empire has known—labored to
their loins in water, whilst they filled up the
insatiable sea with great fragments of rock
blasted from the hillside upon whose summit
Fort Scratchley stands to-day. Like beasts
they lived, and like beasts they died, and
those who survived seldom got anything out
of their subsequent careers but beastliness
and misery. It was a strong man indeed
who could come through that fierce ordeal
and retain in his composition the elements
of decency and self-respect.
The coalmines were worked by gangs of
convicts whose lot was little better than that
of their fellows upon the breakwater. Up
the river, and along the banks of the Pater-
son and the Williams, assigned servants and
ticket-of-leave men were fast exterminating

aa ™ly a stick remains to-day.
harming and grazing had extended far up
tne river, almost to the pass across the Liver-
Fj o', 0 ', Langes above Murrurundi, but nearly
all the labor of it was done by prisoners, or
those who had been prisoners. The free man
was an aristocrat, or one of that sturdy yeo-
man class which such wise visionaries as Dr.
mng had already recognised as constituting
ie only means by which the real pioneering
ot Australasia was to be accomplished. The
convict was a serf, a chattel, a thing of less
account than the herds and flocks to whose

■ tlements along the waterways in his

un the trinnirlis 6 k awa e barge were set
gles, and the Major would inquire
at the farms along the river if there were
any who might be supposed to require the
discipline of the lash. If there were —-and
there generally were—they werh brought
aboard, stripped of their shirts and admon-
ished by the flagellator. A bucket or two
of water splashed over the bloody planking
of the great boat, and she was ready to be
propelled by her crew of galley-slaves to the
next establishment up-stream where the privi-
leges of similar execution were to be prof-
fered. In her stern was a roomy cabin for
the Commandant, and for’ard of it sat a
corporal’s guard of soldiers, with loaded
muskets, who acted as escort and police force.
The Coal River district was a stern and
drastic and damnable place a century ago—
a place of little pity and little probity
amongst either its rulers or its citizens.
And yet Newcastle was, in those days as
it is in these, a very beautiful place, and of
many charms. To you who hurry by its
waterfront in railway-trains it may have the
sordid appearance of a great seaport whose
principal export is coal, and whose citizens
are mainly concerned with delving in black
pits, or cheating the mariners who come to
it from all the world. But ascend the hills
behind it to the southward, and you will be
struck by the amazing beauty of the scenery
that lies on every liafid.
To the northward the long curve of Stock-
ton Beach reaches nearly to Port Stephens,
twenty miles away. Opal mountains lie
behind the flat expanse of wooded littoral.
To the west the mining villages, half hidden
by a haze of smoke, stretch over valleys and
ridges in a fashion not unpicturesque. and
behind them are woods and other distant
blue mountains. To the south the serrated
coastline is very beautiful. And eastward
lies the vast curve of a blue segment of the
vastest ocean in the world.
Prom the high point where the Obelisk
stands to-day a young man in the uniform
of a subaltern officer of H.M. 3rd Regiment
of Foot —the famous Buffs —gazed down at
a schooner out to seaward, rolling lazily in
the blue radiance of a sunlit sea. And from
her poop a girl in a white muslin dress
looked up at the land, and speculated
vaguely as to what fashion of life might be
hers when she had stepped ashore in what
she had heard was the most severe and primi-
tive of all the settlements in Australia.
Ahead, two or three points on the port bow,
the high pile of the Coal Island stood up,
off the land, out of the blue waters. The
steeple of Christ Church reared itself, against
the cloudless blue sky of a perfect summer
afternoon, above the green-crested, rugged
cliffs abeam. Far away to the north the
wide sweep of the land, curving north-
easterly, stretched away to Morn a Point, on
this side of Port Stephens. It was a peace-
ful, beautiful scene, and the girl could not
believe that the horrors and hardships she
had been told of really existed behind so
much loveliness.
She was a pretty girl, fair-haired and
dainty, with brave, blue eyes, a determined
little chin, and a way of looking at the
world that gave that much maligned planet
ground for supposing that she admired it
truly. Fanny Allingham did, indeed, admire
the world she looked upon ; but of all the
men and women who populated it she most
admired the young officer o'’ L he Buffs who
was at that moment gazing down upon the
vessel that bore her to him as a bride. She
admired him nearly as much as he admired
himself. Which, though extremely satisfac-
tory to Lieut. John Palmer Cashman, was
not, in some ways, altogether good fortune.
* * * *
Up the river at the Green Hills —that
long stretch of ridge at either end of which
stand to-day the old-time towns of Morpeth
and Bast Maitland —Lieut, and Mrs. Cash-
man were preparing to embark upon the brig
Hunter’s Pride for the voyage down the
river to Newcastle. They had been upon
a belated honeymoon trip, that was three
months’ overdue, and had been staying at
the station of Dr. Comins, R.N., a retired
surgeon-superintendent of convict transports,
who had received from the Government a
grant of 1500 acres in the vicinity of the
Morpeth end of the ridge. He had named
it Comins Hall, and the square stone house,
with its walled courtyard, still stands where
he built it in 1830. The house, however,
which he occupied when the Cashmans
visited him at the beginning of _’26 was a
roomy, slab-walled cottage, having a wide
verandah —with the little apartments at
either end so characteristic of early colonial
architecture—that looked out upon the river,
the wide flats upon its further side still
densely timbered, and the distant blue ranges
to the north-west.
The Hunter’s Pride was a neat brig _of
about 60 tons, commanded by a Cornish
mariner who had been transported many
years before for too obvious indulgence in the
old national pastime of _ wrecking passing
ships by means of deceptive lights on shore
with an eye to profitable loot. His down-
fall had been an East Indiaman. and the
governor and • directors of the Honorable
East India Company had pursued him, with
vindictive frightfulness, even to the very
steps of the gallows itself. That he had
not ascended that unpleasant platform was
only due to the fact that he had once saved
the" captain of a man-o’-war from drowning
in Falmouth Bay. He was a fine seaman,
and every inch of the coast of New South
Wales was familiar to him. Particularly
did he know the Hunter, haying come there
originally with Lieut. Grant in H.M.S. Lady
Nelson, when the first survey of the river
was made.
At the turn of the tide the Hunter’s Pride
dropped away from her moorings into mid-
stream, being given a push off with long
poles by Dr. Comins’s men, and at 2 o’clock
in the afternoon the voyage to Newcastle
was begun.
“My man,” said Mr. Cashman, somewhat
pompously and patronisingly, to the master
of the brig, as she slowly floated under light
sail down the river, “at what hour do you
anticipate we shall reach King’s Town to-
morrow? I am anxious to reach the settle-
ment as soon as may be.”
Mr. Jan Pentreath slowly revolved the
spokes of the wheel and shifted liis quid of
tobacco from the port to starboard side of
his mahogany face. He spat over his shoul-
der into the brig’s wake, and then replied

Making You Old ?
Is a dull, nerve-racking backache wearing you out —
making you feel years older than you are? Do you find
it hard to keep going—impossible to be happy or
enjoy work? It’s time, then, you looked to your kidneys.
A cold, chill or overwork may have weakened the kidneys
and brought on that nagging backache and those sharp,
piercing pains. You may have headaches, dizzy spells
and annoying kidney irregularities. Don’t wait until the
trouble becomes serious. Take things easier for awhile,
and strengthen the weakened kidneys with Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands.
They should help you. Ask your neighbor!
Mrs. E. Wilkinson, 29 Campbell Street, St. Peters, Sydney,
says:—“For some time I suffered agony from lumbago-like pains
across the small of my back. These pains prevented me from
bending or getting proper rest at night, and seriously hampered me
when attending to my household duties. Sometimes I was so bad
that I could hardly move, and if I tried to get about the house the
pain was almost unbearable. After trying all sorts of remedies
without success, Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under
my notice, so I got some, and they did me good almost at once.
After taking two bottles of these pills I was ever so much better,
and eight bottles completely cured me. That was twelve months
ago, and I have been well ever since. 1 always keep a bottle of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills in the house and take a dose
occasionally, and they keep me in splendid health.”
Ten years later Mrs. Wilkinson says:—“l have been free from
backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me eleven
years ago.”

Mr. A. B. Cowell, Sutherland Street, Mascot, Sydney, says:
“Some months ago I was suddenly seized with a terrific pain across
my back, just above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought
at first it would, but, on the contrary, it got worse, and I was soon
so bad that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled,
and even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain.. I
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in fact no position
was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected, being thick
and cloudy with a red sediment. I tried different remedies, but
they gave me no relief whatever. One day a friend suggested I
should take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and it proved, to be
good advice, too, for three bottles cured me completely., driving the
pain out of my back, regulating the secretions and banishing every
other distressing symptom of kidney disorder. I feel splendid now,
and my recovery is due solely to Doan’s Backache Kidney I ills.

with much dignity of the peculiar Cornish
sort:
“Cap’n Pentreath, if ’ee plaizes, Mister
Lootenant. Cap’n. Us’ll be to King’s Town,
so be as Gawd do plaize, on th’ half-ebb to-
morry marnin’. So be as Gawd doan’t plaize,
’twill be on th’ next tide follyin’. If Gawd
doan’t plaize then, us’ll be to King’s Town
in Gawd’s own time —an’ when that’ll be
Gawd on’y knows.”
Mr. Casliman stared angrily at the im-
passive face of the master of the brig with-
out remark, tucked his wife’s arm beneath
his own, and with a flushed face paced down
the deck towards the brig’s waist.
“Infernal impudence!” he muttered. “I
shall write to Dr. Comins to have the fellow
taught his place. Disgraceful insolence!
The fellow should be flogged.”
“My dear Jack,” laughed his pretty wife
up at him, “don’t be such a bear! You
know your tone wasn’t a bit nice. The
Doctor told me he thought very highly of
Captain Pentreath. He came here in Gover-
nor King’s time, and has been free for years.
You trod upon his toes by calling him ‘my
man,’ and he naturally resented it.”
“My dear,” said the gallant officer a little
huffily, “pray do not meddle in matters that
do not concern you.”
The young wife sighed softly. It had not
taken her long to learn that most idols—
even those that are most beloved —may have
feet of clay.
There is scarcely to be found a prettier
stretch of river scenery anywhere to-day
than along that 40 miles of the Hunter.
Wide plains reach back from the low banks
of rich chocolate soil, verdant with cultiva-
tion, to the distant hills and azure ranges,
and the whole course of the run presents
a series of pictures charming in their fresh
peacefulness and pastoral loveliness. A cen-
tury ago the river wound its course through
dense forests of eucalyptus, or between long
stretches of dark mangrove; but it was even
then a voyage of many interests and much
beauty.
They drifted pleasantly with the tide,
with, for the most part, the light nor’-easter
favorable to their progress. Soon after dark
the moon rose, and soon after moon-rise
came disaster. It came at about the place
where to-day the colliers land at Hexham.
Here it was that the Hunter’s Pride fouled
the branches of a sunken tree brought down
by the last flood, swung into the bank and
stuck fast in the mud.
“What is this, sir?” demanded Mr. Cash-
man angrily of the master, after he had
made his way aft from the little cabin, or
deck-house, amidships, which were Dr.
Comins’s own quarters, and were at present
occupied by the subaltern officer and his
wife. “I demand to know what this means!”
“This be th’ south bank o’ th’ river,
Mister Lootenant,” drawled Captain Jan,
“an’ it do mean ns be stuck i’ th’ mud, an’
must stay here till nex’ tide do float us
off.”
“Disgraceful!” ejaculated Mr. Cashman,
when, without any warning, an unexpected
and disco?icerting thing happened that cut
short his expostulations.
With a yell and a rush a number of dark
figures sprang down from the bank on to
the brig’s deck, hustled the. crew of six men
and a boy into the fo’c’s’le, seized the master
and bound him to the rail, and knocked
Lieut. John Palmer Cashman incontinently
upon the head before he had time to draw
his sword or fire a pistol. In less than five
minutes the Hunter’s Pride was in the
possession of a gang of runaway convicts
and all aboard her were prisoners themselves
in the hands of men who harbored many
grudges against all she represented.
Up on the heights to the southward of the
little settlement at Newcastle dawn was
breaking as two persons, a man and a
woman, mounted on horseback, rode slowly
to the summit of, the hill whence Lieut.
Cashman had . looked out for the coming of
his bride-to-be three months before. A few
stars still shone high in the dark dome of the
heavens, and the wide semi-circle of the sea,
curving from above Port Stephens to meet
the coast far to the southward, was as yet
a cold blue-grey. But already the east was
lightening into a pale yellow, cocks were
crowing down in the town, and the birth of
the new day was close at hand. They drew
rein at the top of the hill, and gazed out
upon the ever fresh miracle of the dawn
for a silent minute or two. Presently the
man’s voice—a pleasant and well modulated
one, with something in it that contradicted
the roughness of his appearance —broke in
upon the stillness of the awakening world.
“Well, Fanny,” he said, turning to his
companion, and stretching out an arm in the
direction of the placid river’s mouth, “here
we are. There’s the settlement down there,
and ’tis up in these Windy Hills—though
they’re still enough now—that our roads
must part again. Tell me, is their diver-
gence nothing to you?”
Mrs. Cashman turned her pretty head, and
looked with tear-dimmed eyes into the face of
the man beside her. They were well mounted,
and the wide skirts of her light summer
gown made an effective riding habit. He
was a young, athletic, good-looking man, with
a yellow beard and a deeply-tanned com-
plexion, out of whose face steady, resolute,
sad eyes gazed longingly at the woman sitting
droopingly and dejectedly on the back of the
horse on his off-side. He put out a brown
hand and laid it over hers —a movement
which she seemed to neither resist nor resent.
A sob shook her voice as she answered him.
“Oh, Paul,” she said in a low, unhappy
tone, “you know it is. You must know it is.
God knows, ’tis more than I' can bear. I
cannot think of your going back —to such a
life —with those wild men. Such a terrible
life! A hunted outlaw’s, with every honest
man’s hand against you, and a reward upon
your head. As if you were really a bad
man! God—’tis awful to think about it!”
She turned her eyes seaward and gazed
upon the orange glory that was spreading
high into the heavens. The stars had dis-
appeared. He said nothing, but let his hand
rest on hers. In a little while she turned
to him again with wistful eyes.
“Paul, dear, I know I have no claim upon
you, after the way I treated you four years
ago, at Tonbridge Wells. But will you not
do something for my sake—and for your
own? And for your mother’s? And for
God’s,” she added in a whisper. “Oh, how
I blame myself!” she sobbed. “A silly girk
who didn’t know her own heart. ’Twas I
who sent you to this. ’Tis all my fault. My
fault, my fault.” she repeated, rocking gently
on the side-saddle in the passion of her grief.
His hand tightened over hers as he replied.
“No. no, Fanny. Not your fault at all.
All mine. A d—d young fool, who hadn’t
the courage to face what better men before
him have had to face. When I took the road
—turned highwayman —and held up the
Dover mail, ’twas in a silly mood of mock
heroics over your rejection of me that would
disgrace a sentimental schoolboy. A child-
ish, pettish piece of perverseness that has
given me more shame to think upon than
anything I have ever had to endure in this
cursed country of slaves and tyrants. Lord,
what a young ass I was ! ’Twas all my fault.
I should have had more manhood. But
what is it you’d have me do? You know
there’s nought I wouldn’t do for you.”
“ ’Tis to give up this bushranging life,
Paul dear—to come in and surrender your-
self to Major Morissett. I do not believe
lie’s so hard a man as they say, though”—
she gave a little shudder as she qualified her
faith in the Commandant’s gentleness —-
“though I’ve seen things myself. But lie’s
always very good to me. I would plead with
him on your behalf. Oh, promise me you
will come into King’s Town, Paul dear.
’Twill make me so much happier. You can
outlive your punishments, whatever they may
prove to be. Will you not come in—for my
sake?”
The rising sun was turning the masses of
her fair hair into cobwebs of spun gold when
he looked at her, sadly and grimly. He
laughed—a low, mirthless laugh—as he
spoke, shaking his head slowly.
“It cannot be that, Fanny. Even the life
that I am leading now is better than no life
at all. I once committed moral suicide.
’Twould be but the other sort were I to do
as you suggest, and surrender myself down in
the town yonder. They would hang me for
last night’s affair with Dr. Comins’s brig.
Even if that had not happened, they would
flog me almost to death for having absconded
—and most likely ship me off to Norfolk
Island, which is said to be even a worse
place than this. No, no—l have made my
bed, and I must lie upon it. So we must
part here. It has been something to be with
you even these few hours of the night. ’Twill
always be my sweetest memory of life in
New South Wales.”
He lifted her hand to his bearded lips, and
'kissed it. Then he reined back his horse,
turned his head, and rode slowly down the
hill. She looked after him for a few moments
in tearful silence. Then her red lips set, her
determined little chin tilted upward in the
slightest degree, and she called to him.
“Paul, Paul —wait for me. I’m coming
too.”
Captain John Palmer Cashman is recorded,
in the register of St. Luke’s Church of Eng-
land at Liverpool in New South Wales, as
having been married, in the year 1829, to
Bella, eldest daughter of Thomas Grimes,
Esquire, of Narellan, spinster. He is de-
scribed as a widower, though there were
then living two people in the south of France
who could better have described him as a
bigamist. However, they never troubled to
do so, and none of the present-day descen-
dants of Major Casliman, late of Mulgoa,
are aware that there really should exist, in
their heraldic device, the bar sinister.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rriHE ocean centaurs prance,
Lit with wild radiance
Like laughter’s face!
Nor reeking why nor how
I, too, am happy now
A little space.
The green and golden land
Curves out on either hand
To clasp the sea.
Here for one hour it seems
Life merges with its dreams
And bids them be.
For nights that pined star-pent
In weary discontent
And hopeless feud
Comes with glad recompense
This exquisite, dear sense
Of joy renewed.
She dreams, herself a dream,
Foam-cradled, gleam on gleam—
Sea-trancfed Dawn!
Above her, drenched in light,
Cloud kerchiefs fold, foam-white
With lace and lawn.
The crying gulls dip low;
In measure soft and slow
The dim pines sway.
Sea-washed from pain and stress,
Life holds no bitterness,
No grief to-day.
One sail fades sunward, kissed
With wraiths of opal mist—
One sail of fire
Flees, questing evermore
Some far and fabled shore
Of heart’s desire.
That bourne has nearer gleams
This hour than e’er in dreams
I saw it shine.
As this rose-perfect hour
I gather like a flower
And make it mine.
And turning, heart of me,
From incandescent sea
And flaming skies,
I see dawn golden-bright
Love’s matchless wonderlight
Within your eyes.
