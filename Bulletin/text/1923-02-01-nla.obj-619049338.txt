Nationality in Art
A visiting artist lately told a Melbourne
interviewer that Australian art tended to
become too narrow and provincial, but that
a better state of affairs might be brought
about if more of the younger men could get
away to the art centres of Europe. This
advice, if followed, would soon deprive the
country of any artistic talent it might have;
the future Australian art would be produced
in Chelsea or Fulham, for there would be no
artists left in Australia except those who
were too poor or stupid to get away. But
in any case our visitor’s views on this
matter are heretical. They would be true
only if Australia were some outlying bar-
baric province without any intellectual life,
without art, or even the prospect of it, a
territory meant simply for the production of
wheat and wool, and not a real country with
a delinite character of its own.
I would not suggest that it is necessarily
harmful for a young artist to spend some
time in Chelsea or the Boul’ Mich’, to study
the masterpieces in the Louvre and the
National -Gallery, and to become acquainted
with the latest phases, even the most eccen-
tric experiments, of European art. Just in
the same way it may be useful for a young
writer to go to the University and learn
something of the classics and philosophy.
But, at best, this is merely a matter of
scholarship which belongs to the student
period. Many of the Old Masters whom we
are urged to emulate were content to remain
in the country where they were born. Bach
did very well in a small German town. Rem-
brandt managed to produce masterpieces
without spending his youth in Italy. It cer-
tainly seems a paradoxical position that if
Australia is ever to have any art, it is go-
ing to come from some other country.
I remember the first time I met the Irish
dramatist J. M. Synge, who was interested
in the problem of art "and nationality. I
had lived for some mouths in the Latin
Quarter, near the big studio of Meldrum and
Alston, where an astonishing variety of
students used often to meet. I loved
Paris—-the cafes, the cabarets, the theatres
and restaurants, the violent arguments,
the brilliant scenes, the late walks
down the hill, from Montmartre. Australia
appeared to be a far-off land, sometimes
alluring, but rather vague and empty. How
was it possible to make any literature about
people who knew nothing except how to
drive cattle and shear sheep? Lawson was
writing short stories about them, but I
didn’t think much of Lawson then. lie
hadn’t enough style for my taste. Art was
something more refined than that, an elegant,
fantastic thing, like a Conder fan, or an
Oscar, Wilde play about cultivated people
who spoke in epigrams. Synge had lived
for some years in Paris and spoke the lan-
guage like a Frenchman. He always liked
Paris and French life; but when I expected
dim to sympathise with my unfortunate posi-
tion of being an outer barbarian, an Austra-
lian, he gave me a little advice which was the
last thing I wanted to hear at that time.
“You must get away from Paris,” he said.
“The young men who want to do anything
are all trying to get away from Paris.”
le despised anything abstract and cos-
mopolitan, and thought every country had
ts own material for literature. He was
interested in the little I could tell him of
the life, of the bush, and said that it was better
to write about that than about ballet girls.
W. B. Yeats, who was gathering his forces
together to build up a real Irish literature
and drama, said the same thing. “Keep
within your own borders!” were his exact
words, “The Greeks, the only perfect artists
we know, always kept within their own bor-
ders.” The Irish writers, who belonged to a
small country themselves, were more sympa-
thetic with Australian aspirations than the
English, who were politely sceptical about
anything more important than frozen mutton
ever coming out of one of their own colonies.
Art. unlike science, is national, not cos-
mopolitan. Physics and chemistry may be
the same everywhere, but music and paint-
ing are not, for they are the expression of
the personality of ' a race and country.
Havelock Ellis said long ago that only
what was national in art ever became inter-
national; and recently, in reference to the
latest developments of the Russian ballet,
which seemed to be losing something of its
true national character, Middleton Murry
remarked that, in becoming more cosmopoli-
tan, it had become less universal. The history
of the Russian opera affords a good example
of the different points of view. Glinka,
who is considered the founder of modern
Russian music, was at the Opera House in
Milan one night, listening to its clever but
superficial melodies. A young man of the
world, rich, cultured, gifted, he w r as idling
among the cities of Europe, when suddenly
the thought came to him that this was not
life, that there was no future here. The
music bored him, for he felt that Russia
had something truer and better to say.
He returned home and began his origi-
nal work that helped to clear the way
for his successors. The later school of com-
posers, such as Borodin, Moussorgsky and
Rimsky-Ivorsakoff, succeeded in producing
an opera which was genuinely national in
spirit, and neither Wagnerian nor Italian.
For many years they were regarded as un-
important, even in Russia, and were quite
unknown abroad. The imported Italian
opera was the fashion, and the Russian
works were played only in drawing-rooms.
Rubinstein, the famous virtuoso, thought
perhaps there might be something in this
nationalism, and composed an opera of his
own. a composite affair, partly Russian and
partly German and cosmopolitan. I forget
whetlmr it was a success or not; hut, in
any case, nobody wants to hean it nowa-
days or any similar works, while all coun-
tries are still interested in Borodin’s
“Prince Ivor” and Moussorgsky’s “Boris
Godounov.” What is meant by cosmopoli-
tanism or universalism is sometimes nothing
but provincialism in disguise. It is provin-
cial to have no standards, no taste, no ideas,
but to accept without thought whatever
comes from abroad. For years Australia
accepted any conventional Royal Aeademy
picture as the last word in painting.
Such pot-boiling stood above criticism.
and was regarded as beyond the reach
of any Australian till Streeton and Lam-
bert were hung in the Salon and Academy.
In matters of art, France is the most
national, and least provincial, of countries.
It accepts no outside standards, and is
always more concerned with what it can
do itself than with what other people are
doing.
Haddon Chambers and Bertram Mnc-
kennal, who left Australia to better them-
selves, can hardly be held up as models un-
less we accept tile doctrine that Australian
artists, unlike all others, must live aw ay
from their own country. Mackennal is
a conventional sculptor, with a reputation
confined to official circles. His mission
seems to be to do all the dull jobs that are
well paid, but that nobody takes the faintest
interest in. Haddon Chambers was of the
same type. He wrote a well-made play, just
a shade inferior to Pinero, and with the
same attitude to life. It should be possible
to do as well as Mackennal or Haddon
Chambers without having to live in May-
fair or Bloomsbury.

The Maori Wars
From whatever point the “wars” which
raged between Maori and pakcha during
about 30 years in the middle of last century
are contemplated, it is impossible to avoid
tin* conclusion that they were discreditable
to the wh.te man. All the lcoreros and
shootings boil down to a phrase. The Maori
was fighting to defend liis home and the land
of his fathers; the pakcha, an invader, to
dispossess the local inhabitant. And through
the smoke of these wars, waged by land-grab-
bers and native owners, the figures of those
old-time Maoris loom to-day as warriors of
renown and sturdy patriots. They fought
bravely, but knuckled down in the end to a
compromise that left them with some of
their country and all of their pride.
They were simple souls in many ways,
those lithe, bush-bred Maoris. Colonel 11.
S. Bates, then an ensign, left a manuscript
account of the hand-to-hand fight which
followed the assault delivered by the Manio-
poto and Atiawa against the entrenched Bri-
tish troops at liuirangi (near Waitara).
An incident: —
Among their wounded was a youth of striking
aspect. His long' black hair and regular features
would have made him appear effeminate but for
the length of limb and splendid muscular develop-
ment which caught the eye even as lie lay on the
ground looking like a dusky Antinous. One of the
65th Royal Irish had heard him groan and was
trying to make him drink from a canteen. I recog-
nised that the wounded lad was moaning “Kai
naranga.” meaning desire to be raised up. A small
red mark on his chest showed that a bullet had pene-
trated a lung, the bleeding from which was probably
choking him. So, kneeling down, I raised him
gently and supported him in a sitting position.
“It is well,” he whispered with a smile; but the
blood gushed from his mouth and he fell back into
my arms. After a little he rallied and I heard
him pantingly endeavor to repeat the Maori render-
ing of the Lord’s Prayer.. . .“Mtirua o matov ham.”
So far he got (“Forgive us our trespasses”) in an
agonised and almost inaudible whisper. Then the
blood poured from his mouth again and the w.-.ght
I supported became very heavy. 'Slowly 1 laid mm
down, and I am hot ashamed to say that my eyes
grew dim as I thought how desolate some heart in
the far Waikato would be when the morning's work
was known.
The history of the campaigns Is now told
for the first time in consecutive form, the
historian being James Cowan. There wusi no
one in Maoriland more competent to under-
take the work than he. Born on the banks
of the placid little I’unia River, almost on the
spot where Rewi Maniopoto put tip his memor-
able resistance behind the earthworks of
Orakau, Mr. Cowan has an unrivalled know-
ledge of the terrain and of the people, both
Maori and pakeha, who carried on the long
series of fights. From his own unique col-
lection of material and the enormous mass of
printed and manuscript records available to
the student, he has written a story which
wall become a text-book.
Mr. Cowan divides his work into two sec-
tions, the first volume dealing with the dis-
turbances from Ileke’s outbreak at Korora-
reka in 1845 to the end of the Kingite war
20 years later; the second volume with the
Hauhau campaigns of ’O4-72. To Maori-
landers familiar in some measure with the
general tradition and the localities mentioned
the volumes'will be absorbingly interesting,
for Mr. CoWan has done bis job particularly
well. Of course, in view of the modern
developments of war, it is a little quaint to
refer to the transactions in Maoriland as
“wars” at all. Rather were they in the
aggregate a sequence of guerilla harryings,
in which the combatants fought with the
desperate intensity of cavemen. Before the
end arrived the parties had a healthy re-
spect for each other. The first idiotic idea
that a company of British redcoats could
march from end to end of the country carry-
ing all before it' was exterminated. The
Ngapuhi, who hurled back assaulting columns
of the finest British troops at Ohaeawai.
well knew that in the end they could not
hope to prevail: and the redcoat who saw
women and children facing death in be-
leaguered redoubts, choosing to die with their
men rather than surrender, first marvelled
at the devotion of such a race, and then
came to love them for their savage chivalry.
Very truly Mr. Cowan, in briefly summing
up. says that had the Maori possessed any
political organisation beyond the tribal, or
had a military genius like Te Kooti led the
tribes in the earlier disturbances, they would
have kept the islands indefinitely. (The Sew

paigns and’ the Pioneering Period. 2 vols.,

sion,” without possessing anything resembling
the brilliant eruptions of poetic vitality that
relieve the barrenness of Wordsworth’s
longer works.
“The Torch-bearers” consists of a pro-
logue and an epilogue, with six versified
encyclopaedia articles on the great astronomi-
cal discoveries in between. The lives, be-
liefs and methods of Copernicus, Tycho
Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and the
two Ilerschels are described with an adher-
ence to fact that would do credit to a bio-
grapher, but seem strangely out of place in
poetry. Most of the poem is little more
than journalism in verse. This, from the
part of the poem dealing with Tycho Brahe,
is typical:—
All his gold he spent;
But Denmark had a prince in those great days ;
And in his brain the dreams of Tycho Brahe
Kindled a thirst for glory. So he made
Tycho the Lord of sundry lands and rents,
And keeper of the chapel where the kings
Of Oldenburg were buried ; for he said
“To whom could all these kings entrust their bones
More fitly than to him who read the stars,
And though a mortal, knew immortal laws;
Arid paced, at night, the silent halls of Heaven!”
The last two lines would have to be much
less commonplace than they are to atone for
the previous ten, which are innocent of a
single imaginative thought. Most of the
book is like this; but some lines, such as
those in which Kepler is supposed to make
known to Wotton his discoveries concern-
ing the behavior of the planets, touch the
verge of the ludicrous: —
1 found....
... .that although their speed from point to point
Appeared to change, their radii always moved
Through equal fields of space in equal times.
There are, of course, comparatively effective
passages scattered through the poem; but
they are not strong enough to counterbalance
the enormous weight of prosaism with which
the work is encumbered. In his preface,
Noyes says that his object is to bring out
the poetic significance of the “great
moments” of science, in which the truth first
flashed through the minds of the famous dis-
coverers. If he had really followed out this
idea, he would, judging by a few isolated
passages in which genuine poetic feeling is
expressed, have had some chance of producing
a readable book. If he had confined himself
to describing the visions and emotions of
the great discoverers in their sublime
moments, and disregarded their means and
methods and the scientific formulae to which
they adhered, he might have given the
romantic aspect of science an effective
poetical embodiment. As it is, “The Torch-
bearers” is an unwholesome mixture of
science and poetry, possessing, true to its
hybrid nature, the vices of both and the vir-
tues of neither.
The interspread lvrics are, in some degree,
a relieving feature, “the Shepherdess of the
Sea” being about the best. One stanza is
rather striking:—
Then waves like flocks of silver sheep
Come rustling inland from the deep,
And into rambling valleys press
Behind their heavenly shepherdess.
You cannot see them? Lift your eyes
And see their mistress in the skies.
K. M.
Ghosts
You miss nearly half the pleasure of life
if you can’t see ghosts. The world is full
of them, but they are, for most of us, thickest
in the little kingdom which is the cradle of
our literature and of our fathers.
As you step out of Australia House to
walk up Fleet-street, a romping crowd of
them come to meet you on the jangle of the
bells of St. Clement’s—ghosts of bygone
years, mostly with grubby hands and soiled
knees to their breeches. They carry you
on to two island churches, round wh ch
surges the traffic of the Strand. In the first of
these tabernacles you meet old Izaak Walton
with a misty copy of his “Compleat Angler” :
at the other, half-hiding a brass-plate fixed
to a seat in the gallery, you see the
bulky, bulbous wraith of Dr. Samuel John-
son, and hear him grunting disapproval of
whoever is in the pulpit. On your left, a
little further on, is another church where
Richardson went, it may be for quiet to
work out his plots; but Oliver Goldsmith
chose better when he turned to the right
and strayed into the Middle Temple. Not
a hundred yards from the roar and racket
of the Strand you can find almost perfect,
peace beneath the old trees of Pump Court;
and then you can pass round Temple Church
and see a gay old ghost pacing the slab
under which Oliver lies. Or if you turn
out of the Strand to the left instead, a
bearded wraith will go with you, and D ckens
will lead you to the Old Curiosity Shop,
now a mite among big warehouses —-almost
at the back of the magnificent Opera House
that Hammerstein built in the new Kings-
wav, where no ghost at all walked for so
long. Pass up Fleet-street, with ink-stained
ghosts in every alley, past Ludgate and St.
Paul’s, with ghosts more blood-stained than
ink-stained in the crypt, and you get to “the
Bank” where, in the multitude of bell-top-
pered messengers, you don’t expect to find
many Red Page wraiths. Yet, come a few
yards along Cornliill, and just opposite the
Union Bank of Australia you will find
Thomas Gray sitting on the steps of a
broker’s office: he has come back to his birth-
place to write the “Elegy in a Country
Churchyard.” Eondon doesn’t label many
such places; but you will find another right
at the far end of the city. “Benjamin
Disraeli, author,” it says, lived there —
you will find it as you try to pick your way
from the Museum, a great haunt of ghosts
and Americans, to the little Poetry Book-
shop in its little back street.
Disraeli’s choice was better when he went
to Dorking to write “Coningsby.” That an-
cient village, like so much of Surrey and its
neighbor Kent, is full of. ghosts. Tony
Weller lived at a coaching inn in North-
street. The Evelyns are squires of the neigh-
borhood : one of them wrote the Diary that
used to be on all bookshelves. Keats and
Sheridan were charmed by Dorking’s quiet
beauty. Lord Nelson brought Lady Hamil-
ton to Burford Bridge, a mile or so along
the Guildford-road, to bid her good-bye in
the garden of a hotel where you may sit and
have 4 o’clock tea of bread and butter and
watercress. They had told me about George
Meredith, too, and I wanted to see if his
ghost was comfortable. It is sad to relate
that the local car-driver didn’t know Mere-
dith —never heard tell of him. But we found
him hovering around a sun-dial on the lawn
of a square, two-storeyed, vine-covered house
at the foot of Box Hill with a sort of de-
tached bungalow or summer-house, where he
did his writing. They buried him in the
village churchyard alongside.
I can more easily believe that Meredith
had his desk there than that Wordsworth
used the Poet’s Chair near Grasmere, an
uncomfortable perch overlooking the lake.
His birthplace was at Cockermouth, another
solid old square building, closed to visitors,
to the great disgust of the American tourist,
who dearly loves to see the very spot whereon
the infant who lived to greatness made his
first astonished squeak. Robert Southeys
old home, now “a school for young ladies,
is handier to Keswick. Shelley lived near
by, but the villager knows nothing about
him. He wasn’t, like Southey, for 40 years
a highly respectable resident of the village,
as the square-topped tomb tells you the
Laureate was. Incidentally, we can dismiss
the new-fangled notion of calling him
“Suthey.” The village has known the fami y
from the days of the Oldest Inhabitant s
father, and it calls him the old ‘‘Southey ’ to
a man. Very rich in ghosts is this watery
part of England. On the way to hear for
yourself how the waters come down at
Lodore —if it is a warm day you will find
it very considerate of them to come down
in the back yard of a comfortable hotel
you will see a John Ruskin monument along-
side beautiful Derwentwater; Friar’s Crag
they call it, and a visit to this spot was the
first thing in his life that Ruskin could re-
member. It was a fine site to choose for
a memorial. The Scotch, who in such mat-
ters choose well, couldn’t have done better.
Two of theirs in particular I recall. One
is to Duncan Bail Mclntyre, on the summit
of the wildest countrv that looks down Loch
Awe, where, if the weather favors you, you
may find surelv the most wonderful reflec-
tions in the world. Duncan Ban was the
singer and the historian of those, parts. Ihe
other looks out upon Loch Leven, and is to
“Nether Lochaber,” the poet and philosopher
of Ballachulish and thereabouts—thereabout
being chiefly Glencoe; and if nobody else
sees ghosts there, surely the Campbells do.
The ghost I seemed to get most intimate
with was Sir Walter Scott’s. We spent lialf-
an-hour together wandering around the Wav-
erley novelist’s old workroom _at Abbotsford,
a room lined with books, with a staircase
leading up to a gallery lined with more books,
a door in one end opening into his bedroom.
Perhaps there was a catalogue; but I didn t
see it, nor any sign of a settled plan in the
arrangement of the volumes. While I was
wondering how a busy man could make good
use of his authorities if he didn’t know where
to instantly find them, the ghost beckoned me
into the library. More pretentious this, wtk
presentation writing-desks and so on, the
shelves holding an extraordinary number of
books in French and German, the former
especially: the novelist’s wife was I rench.
Elsewhere a great collection of junk: one
room given up entirely to arms of one sort
and another. Among them Rob Roys gun;
but I fancied I saw the ghost wink, ana I
have a suspicion that he doesn t really be-
lieve the rogue ever owned a gun
so good. Perhaps it is as well that Scott
was never able to realise how involved his
financial affairs were after the smash ot the
publishing-house which he had backed. He
left Abbotsford, but no money to maintain
it Of Els two sons one, w T ho was doing well
in the army, died on his way home from
India. The other “died abroad” —it is left
at that. The present possessors descend from
a daughter: they are not affluent; part of
the house is generally let; and enough for
unkeep and perhaps a little over comes from
the shillings of a steady stream of visitors,
in these days largely American.
S. H. P.
How Times Change!
I don’t know how it happens that I have
never joined the A.J.A., because I approve
of reasonable unionism and have always
been on the edge of doing it. I think, in-
deed, that if Australian authors ever began
to take their interests seriously the Authors’
Section of the A.J.A. might do much gen-
uinely good work. At present, copyright, so
far as it affects the writing fellows, is a
farce. Some of us make a fuss when an
American hog pirates our matter, but to
the little multitudinous swine of Australia
we are amazingly indifferent. A man sells
matter to a paper, but his copyright is his
own. Any other paper that steals the stuff and
republishes it infringes his copyright. But
though there are many papers m Australia
that fill a large part of their issues with
stolen matter, such thieves are apparently
never brought to book. If a writer went
into one of their dens and took a guinea
from the till, they rvould be mightily outraged
and aggrieved; but they take countless
guineas from the writers’ pockets, and still
escape gaol. Why? Perhaps the A.J.A. can
tell us why?
For the rest, times have changed in
journalism, and I cannot see that the A.J.A.
has changed them for the better. Original
writers are no better paid than they were
when I trailed round at the heels of Dr.
Talmage 30 years ago, and it is much
more difficult to sell good stuff, because the
papers, conducted by young men who regard
the A.J.A. as a bonzer institution, have
formed an awful appetite for bad stuff, and
in many cases don’t know good stuff when
they see it. I have failed to discover that
the A.J.A. is in the least incensed or per-
turbed about this. If I were to collect and
publish now a scrapbook, fairly representa-
tive of some of the tosh certain Sydney
papers are publishing, those papers would
have me up for libel. But 30 years ago
the papers published surprisingly little tosh.
When I joined the S. M. Herald —a paper
which I cordially respect and trust still,
despite its old-ladyisms—l found myself
among men who cared for good literature,
who could talk wisely and aptly about real
things, and who could in every case write
at least creditably. The same conditions
held when I was for a short and volcanic
period with the Daily Telegraph. There
were a dozen men on the staff who could
and did write jolly good stuff. Books and
theatres were admirably done. The
ephemeral descriptive writing was of a gen-
eral quality never attained now. And in
a crowd of good reporters, all real fellows,
Percy Hunter was the best and most re-
sourceful reporter I had ever met, or ever
have met since. What has become of the
old spirit? God alone knows. I know that
the A.J.A., with the best intentions, has
been partly responsible for the disappear-
ance of it. In those old days, if a man was
worth his pay, he was, as the times went,
paid well. If he was npt worth his pay,
he was not employed. And that kept him
always rather keen on doing the best work
that was in him.
When I went to Brisbane in ’97 it was
much the same. A finer lot of men never
made common cause than those of the
Courier staff, and they were all men of the
bygone age when all could at least write
English when they lett school.
That is why I think that the Authors’
Section of the A.J.A. might even yet do
something for journalism. I know that the
job of doing anything must be terribly hard,
because so many of the present-day reporters
who have never written anything worth a
damn have no ambition to write and no
definite ideas or ideals about writing. In the
old days, when any man in a newspaper-office
wrote well and won recognition, every other
fellow' in the office rejoiced in his success.
Times have changed. In 1923 the average
fellows would do all that lay in their power
to boycott and belittle the good man. In the
old days the reporters’ room was the en-
trance-way to journalism ; now it is a place
where a number of good chaps, quite re-
spectable and inoffensive otherwise, drudge
at a trade for which they are not in the
least enthusiastic. I have listened lately
to a lot of comments by average drudges on
young men of promise coming on, and
almost invariably there has been sortie sneer,
some slur, some mean insinuation. What’s
wrong with us?
I have hea.rd the women blamed. People
have said to me that the craft has not
been improved by the women now compet-
ing in it. That is rubbish. I have not
the slightest hesitation in expressing my
conviction that the average woman in Aus-
tralian journalism to-day is a better
journalist, certainly a better writer, than the
average man; and I’m willing to lay my
head that she knows at least a hundred
per cent, more about books and the things
that interest intelligent and thoughtful
people. I know that at times she blunders,
whooping into dogmatic statements in the
realm of criticism that make her absurd;
but that, after all, is only because she has
not discretion to match her very genuine
enthusiasm. Discretion is a niggardly
quality, in any case. One thing I love the
newspaper-women of Sydney for is that
they do not take Ausiralian-women writers
of the fashionable sort at their faked pub-
licity-valuation. I saw the other day in a
Sydney newspaner a statement that Miss
Ethel Turner (I forget her married name)
is the foremost Australian woman-writer.
What could be more preposterous than that?
It is so preposterous that I am sure no
new'spaper-woman wrote it.
FRANK MORTON.
A Satchel of Books
Fra aments of Life, bv Margaret Wynne Nevinson
(George Allen and Unwin). Soft, pappy fragments
these, and hardly worth sweeping together.
The Sundowner, by B. P. Robin (S-P-C- K )- T^ s
Bush Brother of Hughenden can write, as Ins c e
scription of the Lawn Hill homestead testifies and
he has humor; but his material is thru, and .ie
might easily have drawn a more attractive pictuie .

Frank of Freedom Hill, by Samuel A. Derieus
(, Doubleday, Page). Frank is a red Irish sette .
and, though you may not go on believing ha
the things you’re told he and his friends dtd, yoi
will probably be ready to swallow it all while
you are reading this fascinating dog'-boolc.
The Wounded Name, by D. K. Broster (John
Murray), is a capital story of “The Hundred Dai's
of 1815.” The scene opens m England but is
rapidly transferred to France. It is a tale o
fighting and love and high adventure of the type
of which Stanley Weyman has hitherto been the
most popular exponent, and it is not praising it
overmuch to doubt if Weyman has written much
that is better. There is love in it, of course, but in
the passionate devotion of one man to another there
is a love passing the love of woman.
A Fardel of Epigrams (Oxford Press) is a handy
little collection of mordant witticisims drawn mainly
from the Neo-Latin and French epigrammatists ot
the 15th-l7th centuries, done into English by * • • •
Barnard, a Doctor of Literature, who also supplies
some useful notes. A sample suggested by Madame
Deshouti£res (1694);
The Birth of Love.
To Adam Eve had slyly wagered kisses three
That God would never miss an apple from the tree;
She lost, but pay withheld, and made a great ado:
The first he had to snatch, she gave the other two.
Mateship with Birds, by A. 11. Chisholm (Whit-
combe and Tombs). A delighful volume ot gossip
about Australian birds written by a man who knows
a nil loves them, who can view them with a scienti-
fically observant eye and talk of them with the
lyricism of a. poet. The book is compact with
facts, some old, some new, but all set forth in a
way that lifts it clear of dry-as-dust and imports
into it something of the real spirit of the bush.
A notable feature is the fine series of photographs
with which it is illustrated. Some of them are
eloquent monuments to the patience of the camera-
man —as, for instance, that of a yellow robin feed-
ing his mate as she sits on the nest. Others
are equally eloquent of what can be achieved in
the way of gaining the confidence of wild things.
A couple of these —one showing a bird contentedly
brooding on her nest while two urchins squat a
foot or so from her, and a second showing the snub-
nose of an infant within a few inches of another
bird similarly engaged—are nothing short of amaz-
ing. The book, which, by-the-vvav, is well indexed
and finishes with a list of scientific names for the
benefit of those who want to know that the satin
bower-bird is Ptilonorhpnchus holosericeus, should
find its way to the shelves of all who regard
. with any interest at all the birds of the eastern
half of the continent.
“S.T.S.”: If Inge, of London, takes the trouble
to read his stuff as syndicated in the world’s press,
he is likely to say something unclerical over the
opinion that one prominent Australian daily attri-
butes to him on clerical morals. Protesting against
an incident in Walpole’s new novel “The Cathedral,”
the Dean asserted that “99 clergymen out of 100
are no more likely to commit adultery than to
commit burglary.” The paper in question cynically
left out the “no”! In the Middle Ages, or there-
abouts, an Oxford printer omitted a negative, with
a similar context, in the 7th Commandment. The
result is eagerly sought after by collectors as “The
Wicked Bible.” The printer had one of his ears
cut off to teach him to be more careful, as well as
having to pay a grievous fine; but nobody seems
to bother about slack proof-reading to-day.

LION “Brand”
ENGINE
PACKING
—recognised throughout
the world as the best and
most reliable that has
ever been produced.
For most classes of engineering, where ordinary pack-
ing is quite unsuitable or otherwise unreliable, Lion
brand has been proved to give the highest satisfaction.
It reduces friction to a minimum: its durability is
remarkable; and it keeps the gland perfectly tight
even under the most unfavorable conditions.
For years it has been adopted and used with satisfac-
tion by the Government Railways, Tramways, and
leading Steamship Companies. Block Packing,
Expanding Packing or Automatic Pump Packing—all
obtainable in “Lion” brand.
“HUILE-D- ——
MOTOR Cylinder OIL
“Huile-D” Motor Cylinder Oil has been unsurpassed
for more than 20 years in its work of overcoming
Friction and Heat.
It has exceptional qualities for a perfect flow of pdwer
to the engine at all times. By reason of its unusually
high “flash point’’ “Huile-D” is capable of withstand-
ing terrific heat without carbonising, and is also particu-
larly suitable for working under forced feed.
Truly a remarkable oil for engines susceptible to
sooting plugs or carbon. Sold by all good garages,
or direct from us.
STOPSKAL
BOILER COMPOUND
-—the guaranteed remedy and preventive of Scale, Oil,
Grease and Pitting or Corrosion in Steam Boilers.
Stopskal means an all-time full-power output from
boilers —no laying off. Coal bills cut 1 0 per cent.
SAVES FUEL, as it keeps all sediment off the plates
and tubes.
SAVES REPAIRS, as the boiler is protected with a
glazed surface.
“STOPSKAL” does not
contain acid, caustic soda,
arsenic, malt, eucalyptus,
phosphorus, potasn, etc.
Price 2/6 per lb. (lib.
makes 1 gal. of Stopskal
boiler fluid).
ADAMITE
ASBESTOS
PACKING
Adamite Asbestos Pack-
ing is totally different and
superior to any rubber
sheet packing. Adamite is
a highly compressed Jointing with a foundation of
genuine asbestos; consequently it withstands the
greatest heat because it cannot char or burn. It cannot
blow out if properly packed, and neither will it
expand with pressure. We unhesitatingly recommend
this jointing in preference to all others of similar
construction. Sold in sheets 40in. square, from 1 -64 in.
thickness, upwards.
ADAMSOLINE —
GEAR COMPOUND
With this scientifically-compounded lubricant in your
gear-box you are always certain of quiet, pleasurable
motoring. No noisy gears, no hard changing—the
gear teeth engage and disengage silently and smoothly.
Adamsoline cannot be squeezed out from the gears,
and it adheres to the face of the metal without the
“tackiness” customary to ordinary lubricants. Equally
effective in the differential, as centrifugal force cannot
throw it from the pinion or crown wheel teeth.

The City.
The street went by on leather and on wheels,
Only the stones were motionless and
brown ;
And in the caves of the high cliffs of town
I ean pens were moving at the fretful heels
Of the black figures that in jigs and reels
Danced out a balance or came trooping
down
To see a venture or a profit drown
In shallow ink that whispers and reveals.
Books heavy with the challenges of fate!
The trivial clerkship keeps the world in
breath
Where the high cliffs are closed against the
noon
Of the great sun, the singing counters hate.
Life flutters; but the walls are walls of
death
Reared in the ancient sorrow of the moon.

The Shrine.
It is the mystic home of mysteries,
Pamela’s garden, and a guarded shrine,
For here are sentinels of sombre pine,
And here are walls of languid lilac-trees
That bend and sway, a-drone with drowsy
bees;
And here, a chalice for the sacred wine,
A lily-cup that I on bended knees
May offer, humbly, as to one divine.
Lilies alone were offering fit and meet
For this most cold and most unchanging
star—
Ah, Galatea’s heart were warmer far!
Though gold and gems be piled around her
feet,
Ponnies and roses—fiery-hearted, sweet —
She will not stoop to where her lovers are

Last Lights.
Beauty at last must die,
And my youth, as I wander
Down the rough path of my days, halts
wearily.
Is there, should it still endure,
A light out yonder,
Luring it on to a rest that is final and sure,
When the last of my journeys is trod,
In the bosom of God?
Light gleaming there in the darkness, light
sweet and clear-streaming,
Out past the wreck of my dreams.
Strengthen my heart till I reach you, dear
light gently beaming!
Often it seems
That my strength must go out in the night,
In the night that is black with my sorrow,
Often it seems that I cannot hold on till
the morrow....
Stay ye my feet as they stumble, and keep
me from falling.
Tender and exquisite light,
Dear light palely calling!

A breeze has come to the pines,
Whispering soft and low
Under the midnight stars
Things that the pines would knpw.
Out of the sea it comes,
Over the flying foam,
Bringing them from afar
News of their island home.
“Pines on the heath,” it says,
“Growing in ordered lines,
Far is your native isle,
Sad are your sister-pines.
“Ever and ever they moan,
Tossing their plumes on high,
Mourning for ye, their kin,
Under an alien sky.
“Now is their voice a dirge,
Now ’tis a requiem—
‘Wind of they sea,’ they say,
‘Carry our grief to them.’
“South towards the sun they gaze,
Dreaming for ever of ye;
Lone is their little isle,
Set in the washing sea.”
Up from the midnight deep,
Racing over the foam,
A breeze has come to the pines.
Bringing them news from home.
Crests in the starlit gloom,
Roots in the alien sand,
Weary of exile all.
Lone in the night they stand.

THE LEVELLING-DOWN SYSTEM.
In Sydney nowadays, when a eitizen adver-
tises that he wants a man to distribute hand-
bills or potter about a pitcher-theatre, a
policeman is detached to form the appli-
cants into a queue. But along with the sad-
dening over-supply of the kind of laborer
who can "turn his hand to anything,” there
is a chronic deficiency of workmen who have
learned to handle tools with average skill.
So serious is the shortage in the building
trade that the Master Builders’ Association
has adopted a scheme of intensive training
under which it is proposed to turn out brick-
layers and the like in 13 weeks, the asso-
ciation paying all expenses. A point in.
favor of the experiment is that it will save
a few score young men, perhaps a few hun-
dreds, from drifting into dead-end occupa-
tions. Obvious objections are that it is
apt to produce inferior workmen and pro-
voke industrial disputes. In any case, the
thing can only be a palliative, and not much
of a palliative at that. Until a permanent
solution of the apprenticeship problem is
arrived at, better results are likely to flow
from the actions of unions like the Mel-
bourne plasterers, who are starting to train
youngsters on the union’s own account and
at its own cost.
• » * *
The plasterers’ proposal is an incident in
a controversy started by two or three Mel-
bourne builders who declared that the unions
didn t cave a dump whether their members
were skilled or not, and that the class of
labor available was never scarcer or poorer
than at present. The union’s retort is certainly
a welcome change from that favored by the
Sydney Labor Council, which exclaims on
such occasions tLat it defies the bourgeois
oppressor; also, that property is robbery,
that the workers should go forward, having
nothing to lose but their chains, and that
there will be no scarcity of labor when the
Revolution arrives. Another pertinent con-
tribution to the Melbourne argument was
made by John Dias, secretary of the Car-
penters and Joiners. After a few remarks
about the need for compulsory training of
apprentices, since “no nation can be great
or prosperous without an abundance of
trained artisans,” Dias said i
There is another aspect of the matter which
should receive serious consideration, and that is
the meagre rate of payment for skilled artisans as
compared with laborers, which has been the cause
of manv going to work outside the building industry.
On many building works to-aay the builders’ labor-
ers are being paid an equal, and in some cases a
higher, rate than carpenters. As a general rule in
Victoria tile unskilled laborer gets about SO per
cent, of the wages paid to artisans, and they work
the same hours. In the United States laborers
get about 40 per cent, of artisans’ wages, and
generally work longer hours.
The last statement is supported by an article
in the Saturday Evening Post, of Nov.
11. Reviewing the conditions in 41 U.S.
towns, ranging in population from 7500 to
160,000, Edwakd Mott Woolley wrote:—
The average pay for carpenters in the 41 cities
is 6.63 for an eight-hour day, but running
around 7.20 dollars in many cities. Masons show
an average of 8.26 dollars a day; plumbers, 8.16
dollars; skilled machinists. 6.46 dollars; machine
tenders, 4.32 dollars; truck-drivers, 4.26 dollars.
Laborers, excluding extremely low instances in the
South, average 3.13 dollars.
This naturally suggests comparisons between
American and Australian rates of pay. As
far as trained workmen are concerned, the
comparisons are greatly to Australia’s dis-
advantage, even when allowance has been
made for the fact that the cost of living is
steeper in Uncle’s country. As regards the
rewards for skilled and unskilled labor, Mr.
Dias has stated the position correctly. Also
his generalisation is true of the other five
States as well as Victoria. There is no
appreciable difference between the bulk of
a stonemason’s pay envelope and that of a
billiard-marker’s. The man who drives a
locomotive engine, and has thousands of lives
under his care, gets little more than the
person who cleans the carriages when the
train is back in the yard. A carpenter,
whom it takes seven years to learn his trade
thoroughly, and who is obliged to purchase
an expensive outfit of tools before he can
start, is no better off than a corporation
scavenger, a timekeeper on a Government
dirt-job, or a steward on an Australian
steamer—indeed, it is a standing grievance
among the officers on Australian steamers
that, with tips thrown in, the stewards make
more than they do. And it is just as re-
munerative to pull beer for a living as to
belt iron or steel. When the Newcastle
(N.S.W.) steelworks were on the point of
closing down, the Sydney barmen and bar-
maids put in a claim for wages higher than
those paid by the Broken Hill Prop, to any
class of employees except fitters.
# #
It is all part of the levelling-down system
which has been fastened on the country
since the rulers thereof became infected with
the socialist heresy and the people accepted
its implications. The same principle is at
work in the grossly overmanned Government
departments, where smirking Tadpoles and
Tapers, who owe their absurd positions to
the favor of some Minister, are paid on a
princely scale, while highly-accomplished
scientists, whose work is of the utmost import-
ance to the Commonwealth, receive salaries
that a self-respecting wharf-laborer (the
highest-waged toiler in Australia when times
are good on the wharves) would scorn. One
of the two parties into which Australia’s
Parliaments are normally divided champions
the levelling-down principle, the other party
passively approves of it, mean emplovers
profit by it, or think they do, and arbitra-
tion judges give it the force of law. Hence the
vanishing apprentice, the persistent short-
age of craftsmen and the steady decline in
the quality of the work performed. Australia
has set the unskilled laborer on a pedestal.
It borrows prodigiously to provide him with
more or less futile jobs, and keeps on bor-
rowing to inflate his wages. In a country
so deluded there is no encouragement for a
boy to learn a trade and not much incentive
for a man to stay in one.
WHY LAND SETTLEMENT FAILS.
The proposed new system of land settle-
ment in N. S. Wales appears to be really
the old one, with much the same frauds
whooping it up as a fresh .revelation. The
Closer Settlement Act of 1901, ditto of
1904, ditto of 1907 and of 1909, and minor
enactments, together with the Federal
graduated land-tax and sundries, have been
and still are at work. When the Storey -
Dooley Government arrived and invented
land settlement over again, a law authoris-
ing the State to resume any property of
more than 20,000 acres had been in full
bloom for 13 years. Last year 1,200,867
acres of Crown land were “settled,” which
looked like an addition of 35 per cent, to
the wheat area, and this sort of thing hap-
pens annually. But for some reason there
is a steady tendency to sell out or just drop
out. Recent official reports of the progress
of the Ma State are interesting in this con-
nection. Here are some :

1921 25,780 10,661
1922 (prelim, estimate) 23,600 .
And these were strenuous years, when the
talk of “settling people on the land” was
louder than ever before, and the borrowings
for the purpose of “developing the country”
were beyond all previous imagining. About
£80,000,000 of new debt was incurred in
the acquisition of some 140,000 population
that wasn’t purely city population, for the
hardy bushmen of Auburn, Bankstown,
Granville, Lidcombe, Parramatta, Hornsby,
\\ arrmgah and Newcastle can hardly be
called country population, though they are
reckoned as such. That meant a new lia-
bility of over £571 per hardy settler. In
the same xieriod of close settlement at Rand-
wick and intense culture at YVoollakra, the
annual interest bill of N. S. Wales (almost
all of it interest on “development” borrow-
ings) rose from £3,5.00,000 to £8,300,000
partly, it is ti-ue, because the State credit
shrivelled, the rate of interest on the entire
debt rising from £3 10s. 6d. per cent, to
£5 Is. 3d. per cent, inside 10 years, and
£5 ss. per cent, is in sight.
* * * *
It being thus quite evident that “settle-
ment schemes” have produced no settlement
worth mentioning, notwithstanding the ex-
penditure of many millions of borrowed
money, it ought to be obvious that before any
further measures of the same sort are
adopted an inquiry should be made into the
causes of past failure. The Fuller Gov-
ernment pronoses nothing that other Govern-
ments have not proposed; so if the same
causes are operative now, there will inevit-
ably be the same failure. The Bulletin
does not know all the causes of failure; but
it thinks it knows some of them, as follows:
(1) Wrong people have been put on the land. The
inexperienced man has been flung on to a “farm”
of his own—mostly it has been only 'some of the raw
materials out of which a farm might be made—and
r.ine times out of ten he has failed. A man who
knew nothing of brewing would also make a failure
if lie were thrown on to a city block and told to
build a brewery and make a million out of it. And
it is very doubtful whether a course at an agricul-
tural college or experimental farm is of itself suffici-
ent for the settler; anyway, a year or two spent as
a worker or share man on a farm run by an old
hand at the business does even the agricultural-
college student no harm. Without that training
failure is almost certain.
(2) Most “settlers” have had insufficient capital.
There arc very few districts in N. S. Wales, and not
many elsewhere in Australia, where the wheat cocky
is not liable to be hit by a drought in his first year,
and sometimes in his first two years. He will almost
for certain be hit by one or two before he is well
on his feet. We have put men on the land with
either no money at all or only a few pounds, and
we have mostly taken the little they had by way of
“deposit.” They have gone under at the first stroke
of misfortune.
(3) V»e have sent out right men with wrong
ideas. This is especially true of settlers from over-
seas. Not only is cockying hard work, but it is
chockful of disappointments. A man may—probably
will, if he is the right stamp, and is in the right
place have a tidy bank balance and perhaps a
“tin Lizzie” in 20 years; but that will be only as
the result of half-a-dozen or less extra-good years.
Half of the other 14 (or more) probably won’t give
the family bread-and-dripping; and if the dis-
appointments crowd in early, the man who doesn’t
know about them' will most likely take a job tram-
driving in the city.
(4) The fad of some politicians for giving leases
“perpetual” or otherwise—instead of freehold, has
stopped many a man from getting financial help
when it was necessary to enable him to tide over one
of the dry times.
(5) The vote-hungry politician in and out of the
unions has pushed up the wages for unskilled labor
until the cost of building and running railways
has made fares and freights staggering; and the
cocky has suffered most from that, as well as through
having to pay excessively for his own unskilled or
little-skilled labor and for all other services.
(6) Afraid of vested interests, Governments have
done little or nothing to promote co-operation among
cockles, so they have had to pay through the nose
for everything.
(7) The farmer has been able to make little or
nothing out of the sidelines—eggs, etc.—that ought
to have paid the grocery bill, because there have
been no big towns handy, the one-big-city curse
having eaten up the country towns. And that is
mostly a matter of manipulating railway routes and
chaiges; and that in its turn has been made pos-
sible by allowing one overgrown city to practically
rule the vast territory within the boundaries of each
present State. There is no hope for much improve-
ment except in subdivision.
A dozen or a hundred other things have
helped to clear the land of settlers as fast
as the politicians have settled them, and
sometimes faster; and unless the causes are
removed Fuller’s soheme will have the same
results. In fact, it may have rather worse
results than some others, because it will
piobably lead to the pushing off of experi-
enced men who are making good use of
country and the arrival of inexperienced and
weakiy-hnanced men who will not only make
poor use of it but probably turn it "into a
pest-distributing centre as well.
THE PERIL OF THE MAXIMALIST.
Never within the memory of living man has
class-hatred been so general as it is to-day
On its banishment—or, anyhow, diminution
—the prosperity of every country largely de-
pends; yet in many countries it is growing
at such a pace as to threaten their civilisa-
tions, and in none is it being fought as
most other deadly diseases are. The pheno-
menon known as “unrest” is produced to an
extent in British communities by several fac-
tors poverty, a suspicion that corruption
exists in high places, the spectacle of vast
wealth indecently paraded. But all these
factors operated before the war; and cer-
tainly there was no such unrest then as
there is now. What is it that has happened
meantime to intensify the trouble’
*** ' *
One feature that distinguished the war-
period in English-speaking nations was the
chance it gave certain political adventurers
to interfere with the people’s hard-won liber-
ties—a chance which they eagerly took, and
which some of them are still exploiting. Aus-
trail a, for example, was afflicted by W. M.
Hughes. It is doubtful if in this country
12.000 miles from the centre of the conflict
the War Precautions Act was needed at all.
It is certain that, owing to the way in wh ch
the measure was administered, it did far more
harm than good to the Imperial cause. Apart
from the action of the censorslrp in blanket-
ing discussion in Australia of facts wh’ch
were common knowledge, and which were
actually being discussed in Britain (the
shell-shortage, for example 1, there was a con-
tinual reaching-put after fresh powers.
Hughes used Sec. 51 of the Constitution
(the one that allows laws to be made for
“the military and naval defence of the Com-
monwealth”) to put a number of Acts on the
Statute Book which the people had never,
in their worst nightmares, dreamed of see ng
there. The Unlawful Association Act was
a sample. A woman was proceeded against
under it for smashing a window. The argu-
ment was that the smashing of windows in
war-time might “hamper, or dislocate the
work of effectively prosecuting the war,” and
the High Court was constrained to admit
that it might. So, for that matter, might
drinking beer or objecting to governmental
extravagance, or raising the sectarian issue
or doing any otic of a million other things.
The effect of such interpretations was to
transform Australia into a nation of slaves.
Some people like being slaves, others lack
the intelligence to know when they are slaves,
hut a proportion of the residue invariably
get nasty; and the longer the enslavement
persists, and the less justification there is
for it, the more restive and unpleasant they
become.
* * * *
The natural reaction against Hughesism
is Bolshevism. It always has been so back
through the great modern revolutions in
Russia and France to the earliest of the
Roman slave revolts. That Australia did not
suffer in this way was no tribute to W. M.
Hughes, but rather to the solid qualities of
the people and to their high educational
standard. Elsewhere there has been trouble,
varying according as the people concerned
are literate and law-abiding or otherwise.
Only last June in the U.S.A. —which has
always known Czarism of one sort and an-
other, and which had a particularly stiff dose
from the time it entered the war—sooo
miners broke loose in Illinois, and beat to
death or cut to pieces 50 of the opposition,
in addition to severely wounding many hun-
dreds. In Italy the uplicavalists took charge
shortly after the Armistice, and, though the
tally of deaths was small, that was not the
fault of the Red leaders. The industries
of the country were in many cases handed
over to the proletariat, whose members satis-
fied themselves by killing the business in-
stead of the owner. And just as Hughesism
produces Bolshevism, so Bolshevism produces
another instalment of Hughesism. It is
understood that Russia under the Lenin
regime is now learning that the dictatorship
of the bourgeoisie (there is not a single mem-
ber of the proletariat in high office in Russia
to-day) can be just as tyrannous as Czarism.
But the information from Russia is still of
a misty and unreliable nature. Italy and
the U.S.A. afford quite sufficient proof of
the calamities that are liable to descend upon
a nation when the politicians start monkey-
ing with its freedom. In Italy, Mussolini,
after quelling Socialism and disloyalty by
means of cudgels and castor oil, is safely in
the saddle, there to remain till the Bolsheviks
get their heads up again. And, according to
a message from the Rome correspondent of
London Daily Chronicle, “the general
atmosphere is unhealthy” :
As an instance he points out that 60,000 railway-
men are being dismissed, and that the Government
is retaining only the Paseisti. The Government’s
only fate for the men dismissed is emigration. Mus-
solini is reducing Parliament to the status of the
helpless Reichstag under the Kaiser, and it is now
a mere debating society.
In the U.S., in addition to the Ku Klux
Klansmen, who are impartially hanging and
burning blacks and whites, Socialists and
non-Socialistie enemies and trade rivals of
leading Klansmen, Citizens’ Committees are
“being widely formed.” One of these organi-
sations at Harrison, according to a cable
(21/l/’2B), assumed control of 200,000 free
and enlightened American citizens.
A press correspondent declares that in addition to
a man being hanged, 30 men have been tied up and
severely lashed, while 400 men and women have been
driven from their homes. The citizens elected what
was tantamount to a Soviet Government, and ignored
the regular courts and police.
* * * *
The first lesson to be deduced from these
developments is that no one section of any
community can have all the liberty all the
time. In Australia W. M. Hughes, think-
ing to benefit his wealthy admirers, strained
the War Precautions Act to its limit, till
the outcry grew unbearable, and he then
passed a War Precautions Act Amendment
Act which, in many respects, was more
drastic than the original. This has made
Labor sullen and distrustful, to the detriment
of the employing classes and the nation at
large. Mussolini is no friend of the more
affluent Italian classes, any more than the
organisers of Committees and the
like in the U.S.A. are the friends of the
Yankee capitalists. In the long run such
people _ are of value only to agitators and
anarchists. And that being so, they are, of
course, the deadliest foes of the unfortunate
“average man”—-the type who lacks the
money to shift himself and his family from
the scene of a revolution, and the capacity
to put up an effective lone fight for his
household goods. The most gratifying fea-
ture about the fall of W. M. Hughes is
that it was brought about by the best
elements on his own side of the political
fence. Under his arrogant absolutism there
could onlv have been friction between the
classes. With him out of the way, the Com-
monwealth may get back to the freedom
and constitutionalism it enjoyed before the
war, when the Maximalist, whether he
waved a red flag or a national one, was
pretty generally recognised for the public
danger he was and is.
FASCISM IN EAST AND WEST.
It wns in the fertile brain of D’Annunzio
that Fascism first took shape. Distracted
Europe was a fit theme for a poet—especi-
ally a decadent one—and if he could sing his
dirge or epic or epithalamium in men instead
of metre, so much the more magnificent. But
every artist is an adapter, and D’Annunzio
went for his inspiration to the Treaty of
Versailles. There force sat enshrined in
ponderous platitudes. D’Annunzio lyric-
ised his dull model and seized Fiume. His
followers wore black shirts in token of mourn-
ing for Italia Irredenta, and soon their black
caps with black tassels began to appear in
every city. Pension landladies, faithful mir-
rors of bourgeois opinion, breathed their
name with timid approval. Having settled
the international problem by seizing Fiume,
the Fascists turned their attention to domes-
tic matters. Italian labor, exhausted by
the strain of the war and condemned,
as the lire deteriorated on the foreign ex-
changes. to a lower and lower standard of


had got no comfort from the spectacle
of constitutional government as played
at Rome, and was seeking redress in strikes,
which are a European form of non-violent
non-co-operation. Strikes begat governmental
and, lacking the restraint of
Gandhi’s disciples, the strikers replied with
counter-violence. Into this argument the
Fascists threw themselves with lyric ardor,
as the covert tools of the vested interests. It
was regrettable, of course, said my landlady,
stroking her fat arms, that they should fire
on a Sunday-school picnic in mistake for a
meeting of Communists; but what would you?
These Bolshevists had brought it on them-
selves, and if the Government would not help
us we must help ourselves.
In Florence the ex-treasurer of the Bristol
Labor party, an Oxonian who was occupied
in translating Greek hexameters into English
verse, gave me an academic picture of the
. struggle, and through him I arranged to meet
the secretary of a trades union, a waiter in a
Florentine hotel; but he did not keep the
appointment, and, when I went to find out
out why, I learnt he was in prison. It was
very difficult to get at the true position.
The growing power of the Fascisti made
plain speaking dangerous, and, in any case,
the foreign tourist, carried by railway from
one little oasis of cosmopolitan luxury to
another, lives in a fool’s paradise, tended by
sycophantic hirelings of no discernible
nationality or allegiance.
In Rome Palm Sunday sent all the world
to St. Peter’s. Rome was full of pilgrims
from every country: Bulgarian monks and
their acolytes, Chinese seminarists, Austra-
lian bishops and negro priests. Inside St.
Peter’s the confessors sat in their little
boxes marked with all the languages of
Europe and hung out their fishing-rods, like
anglers for souls, while the people came and
went in little shoals from Calabrian and
Sicilian villages. I went to a public audi-
ence with the Pope, and with a hundred
others knelt and kissed his ring and watched
his tiny figure, too small even for the
smallest of the three sets of robes which are
kept in readiness for new popes, moving
against a background of huge Renaissance
canvases, of nymphs disguised as Madonnas
and Greek heroes as St. Sebastians, while
the gorgeous scarlet cardinals and the ornate
officers of the Swiss guard, dressed as
cavalrymen, but condemned only to mount
the gigantic stairs of the Vatican, stood in
a statuesque group at the end of the room.
In the heavy scented twilight behind the
great felted doors of the innumerable
basilica;, opening out of the street full of
motor-cars and hurrying citizens into dim
pools of silence, one could forget that Italy
liad any problems not mentioned in the
Pope’s encyclical.
Finally I went to San Remo, that Eden
of wealthy valetudinarians, where the great
ones of the earth were assembling to discuss
the Treaty of Versailles, and to settle the
destinies of Europe. Warships lay out in the
and hundreds of gendarmes, in Napole-
onic cocked hats and white gloves, strolled
in couples about the streets, plucking roses
from the hedgerows. The debilitated treaty
was installed in the Villa Devachan, where,
under the prophylactic shade of a magnifi-
cent Australian blue-gum, the chief attend-
ants gathered round its bedside.
Lloyd George, suave, smiling and oppor-
tunist; Nitti, fat, smiling and idealistic;
Millerand, small, grey and sombre —these
three little elderly men sat down together
to solve the immediate problems of distracted
Europe, while the press correspondents, the
unconsidered guardians of the public con-
science, stood about the entrance gates
under the suspicious eyes of the sentries,
and the Yugo-Slav commission, the Armenian
committee, the Belgian, French, Italian and
delegations, unofficial delegates from
rebel Korean associations, looked at askance
by the representatives of their Japanese
masters, and Americans with watching briefs,
thronged the casino and the boulevards in
their myriad plumage, all aware of their
own futility, but determined to sell their
leisure as dearly as possible. And outside
this glittering pale ruled over by its tem-
porary Tsars, the sullen strikers hung about
the street corners, the patrols cantered over
the cobbled stones of the cities, agenis-pro-
cocateurs threw bombs into crowds, and
Black Shirts bludgeoned the wrong people.
Italy presented a strange picture of a disin-
tegrating civilisation, in which force, as a
method, of government and of obtaining
social justice, was steadily gaining prestige.
The process has continued, and to-day Fas-
cism sits enthroned, as God’s anointed.
Between Alessandria, in Bologna. Nnd
Guru ka Bagh, in India, is all the distance
between the psychology of East and West.
Everybody knows what is happening at Ales-
sandria. There the black-shirted followers
of the ex-Soeialist Mussolini are banishing
crime and drunkenness by means of cudgels
and eastor-oil. We are not so well acquainted
with what is happening at Guru ka Bagh.
and if the spectators who have described it
were not of quite unimpeachable integrity
we might find difficulty in believing it. The
Guru ka Bagh is a stretch of land a few
hundred acres in extent attached to a small
Sikh gurdwara or shrine about 10 miles from
Amritzar, the scene of the massacre.
The shrine has been for generations
under the management of hereditary trustees
known as Mahants. These Mahants are
suspected by the Sikh community of mis-
applying the revenues of the shrines and
tolerating idolatrous Hindu rites repugnant
to the Sikh religion. A recent religious re-
vival brought into existence the sect of the
Akalis, who are pledged to the purification
of the gurdwaras. The Akalis succeeded in
ousting the Mahant of Guru ka Bagh, but
although he was prepared to give up the
shrine he refused to surrender the land
attached to it, which he claimed as his own
private property. The Akalis, however, in-
sisted on claiming the timber on it. and pro-
ceeded to cut down the trees. They were
arrested and imprisoned. More trees were
cut down and more Akalis arrested. The
Akalis are non-co-operators and followers of
Gandhi. Therefore they are unable to offer
violence in the pursuance of their aims. This
is how the struggle has developed, and unless
some change, has occurred this is apparently
how it is still going on. Every day a jathi
consisting of a hundred Akali volunteers
starts from the Akali headquarters at the
Golden Temple, at Amritzar, followed by a
squadron of motor ambulances manned by
Sikh doctors and boy scouts, and marches
towards the Guru ka Bagh, They nave taken
a Vow that they will use no violence, but
will reach their objective or return senseless.
The dedicated hundred are composed of all
classes, well-to-do shopkeepers, small farm-
ers, returned soldiers, greybeards and young-
sters. About seven miles from the city, at
a little bridge, the disciples of non-violence
meet the majesty of the law, in the shape of
about 18 native policemen and a young Eng-
lish police-officer. The law is armed with
the regulation police lathi, a five-and-a-half
foot brass-shod pole; the non-co-operators
are armed with the determination to become
bloodied martyrs, and with nothing else. The
English police-officer calls upon the jathi to
halt; the jathi marches on. The officer then
commands his men to strike, and the heavy
lathis rise and fall. Before they have time
to strike a second time the whole jathi is
sitting on the ground, except for eight or ten
who are lying senseless. The casualties are
taken away on stretchers, and the survivors
rise once more to their feet. Once more the
lathis rise and fall, and another baker’s
dozen lie prone upon the ground. This
extraordinary routine is continued until the
entire hundred self-constituted martyrs are
effectually disposed of.
The following day a fresh hundred dis-
ciplined fanatics set out from the Golden
Temple at Amritzar for the little bridge on
the route to Guru ka Bagh. The English
eye-witness of this amazing quarrel says that
the day on which he watched was the tenth
in succession on which a jathi had been dis-
persed by this process of disablement. Pro-
bably, if there are any Akalis left, the pro-
cess is still going on. Naturally, the English
officer did not like his job, nor did his men
like it any better, but they have to obey
orders. The authorities do not like the job,
but the law must be upheld. Apparently
there is no authority in India wise enough
or sufficiently freed from official shackles to
judge the matter on its merits and make a
tactful solution. If the Sikhs could only
be tempted into using violence, violence could
be used in return, and in such a game govern-
ments generally score a temporary victory.
But the Sikhs are faithful to their pledge.
They use no arms, they suffer death and dis-
ablement without retaliation. If the police
decided to refrain from force and held hands
all round the Guru ka Bagh the Sikhs would
simply walk through them. So that, until the
Courts can find tifhe to try the case, there is
apparently no alternative before the admin-
istration but to use methods which make
even the executive officer deputed to carry
them out want: to go to the side of the road
and vomit. In the meantime non-co-opera-
tion is piling up a mighty pantheon of mar-
tyrs for future Indian patriots to emulate
or extol.
The English onlooker is scrupulously fair
to the authorities. Given the present situa-
tion, he cannot see how they could act in
any other way. But how has it come about
that a civilised government finds itself in
such a grotesque predicament? It is be-
cause it has lost the confidence of the people.
Useless to tell the Sikh community to be
patient, to await the processes of the law
and the decision of the white man’s court.
They remember Amritzar and refuse to be
comforted. Force begets force, and because
its latent manifestation in India is in the
shape of a moral idea and not a crude dis-
nla.v of bomb-throwing and assassination, it
is nil.the more effective.
Between the loin-clothed fanatics of Guru
ka Bagh and the melodramatic wowsers of
Alessandria there is this much in common,
that they both despise social justice fash-
ioned by generations of unimaginative citi-
zens, and seek more spectacular solutions;
and it is. perhaps, a symptom of Europe’s
disease that Mussolini, the apostle and
organiser of force, should be Premier of
Italy, while Gandhi, the preacher of non-
violence and the power of moral suasion,
should be languishing in prison.
FENG-SHUL
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mediocrities and Humbugs.
One undesirable effect of the party system,
in its present state of development, is that
the Prime Minister is bound to be either a
bit of a fool or a bit of a knave. There
is no room for a leader who scorns under-
ground engineering and trickery as a, means
of reaching the top, and who refuses to palter
with his convictions when he gets there. In
this way, ever since the Reid-McLean com-
pact, if not earlier, the Prime Ministers of
Australia have usually been mediocrities or
humbugs, selectod for one of those very rea-
sons. And it 7 is pretty obvious that his-
tory is going to repeat itself. The choice has
appeared to lie lately between P'ratten, busy
and ambitious, who has not disclosed strong
views on any big question; Bruce, young
and inexperienced and suspected of being-
under the domination of W. M. Huhges ; and
Earle Page, wlo is overshadowed for leader-
ship and resource even by some of the
Agrarians. Many of those who wdll take
their seats in the new Parliament as rank-
ers are more capable than any of the pos-
sible choices, yet they will be lucky if they
rise to minor office. The sort of Prime Min-
ister that is required may be gauged by the
sort of situation he will be called on to face.
If he belonga to the Country party he will
he against arbitration; he will be a Free-
trader—or, anyhow, in favor of lowered
duties on agricultural implements—a New
Stater and a decentralisations generally.
The Nationalists are pledged to uphold arbi-
tration and high tarimsm, and most of them
are strong supporters of the Bloated City.
The Laborijtes are with the Nationalists on
the tariff (and arbitration issues, and with
the agriculturists, in many cases, as to the
desirability of New States. An honest
Prime Minister, with his convictions burn-
ing in hife bosom like a white flame, would
not be a T ble to carry on under such circum-
stances )for a week. So what the country
will get„ if it isn’t afflicted with another
£lOO,OOO (or thereabouts) election, will be
a tempnriser, a Freetrader-Protectionist or
Millions! Club-decentraliser, one who will do
nothing, but explain eloquently that nothing
can be'done. Under the elective Ministry
system- the party curse would presumably
be gradually eliminated. From then on-
wards Prime Ministers would tend to be
elected on their statesmanlike qualities, or,
at the worst, there would be a far greater
likelihood of it than under the present
arrangement. And every fresh measure that
came before the House would be treated on
its merits, so that Laborites and Agricul-
turists (say) might vote for a new State,
and Agriculturists and Nationalists for more
efficient defence without putting legislators
and citizens to the worry and expense of
another election. It is a device designed
to get business done cheaply: the party
system is an expensive way of indefinitely
holding up every controversial measure.
•
The Rise of Million Town.
An official estimate has it that the popula-
tion of the metropolitan area of Sydney, Aus-
tralasia’s greatest city, was 950,660 at the
close of the year. Possibly a revised esti-
mate will make it more than that, for if it
is only 950,000 the greatest city has hardly
been swelling with its wonted velocity. The
population of Greater Sydney is set down at
1,050,000. Greater Sydney is only a geo-
graphical expression as yet, but it stands for
the area which will probably be placed under
the control of the Greater Sydney Council,
or Sydney County Council, when that august
body eventuates. (The writer of this, at
the request of a forgotten Government,
drafted a municipal constitution for Greater
Sydney some 25 years ago, and, as with the
harbor bridge and the uniform railway gauge,
the wonderful vitality of the thing keeps it
still alive.) So this city, capital of a State
with only about 2,160,000 people, is gradu-
ally overhauling Rio de Janeiro, the great
tropical metropolis which started 250 years
earlier, and which is the political centre for
a population of 31,000,000. As it has
been decided to dismantle Rio as Brazil’s
Federal capital, and create a new Canberra
at Goyaz, inland and closer to the equator,
and as the place never was a State capital,
the progress of Sydney’s rival may slow off,
and in a few more years Sydney may take the
lead. Then there will be no agglomeration
of houses and humans south of the line that
can beat the N. S. Wales metropolis save
Buenos Ayres, the over-bloated centre of a
republic with a population of some 9,000,000.
Provided the loans hold out, there is no
visible reason why Sydney should not chase
this last lone rival with a light heart and a
flowing sail. Though little more than an
infant, it has left behind it hardened com-
petitors all the way from Quito to Concep-
cion, and from the African lakes to the Cape
of Good Hope. Certainly there is lack of
any corresponding growth in the country
adjacent to Australia’s newly-acquired Mil-
lion Town, but it is a hungry soul who
expects everything at once. The drop from
the Commonwealth’s biggest capital to the
biggest town which has to exist on its merits,
by plain toil, and not as a centre of patron-
age, political intrigue and loan money, would
be considered dizzy and neck-breaking in
other lands. The decline is from Greater
Sydney, with 1,050,000 inhabitants, or Plain
Sydney, with 950,000, to Greater Newcastle
with 86,255, Broken Hill (26,337) and Ben-
digo (25,693). But mining towns like the
last three are hardly inside the argument.
They exist contrary to the fixed policy of the
politicians, because mines are among the few
things that can’t be shifted to any capital
city. The towns that depend on them are
ephemeral concerns, however, and at some
near or far date they may be relied on to
cease disfiguring the landscape. Leaving out
mining towns there is nothing save five other
State capitals between Sydney, with 950,000
or 1,050,000 population, whichever way one
likes to put it, and Launceston (Tasmania)
with 24,318, followed by Rockhampton (Cen-
tral Queensland) with 24,182. They are
both seaports, but, not being in the metropo-
lis line of business, it hasn’t been considered
worth while to spend much on their develop-
ment. Rockhampton is Sydney without the
advantages of being a seat of government,
or of possessing vast loans and pre-
meditated congestion. Sydney is Rock-
hampton with these advantages. In the
first nine months of 1922 (the statistics
go no further as yet) 9740 new buildings
were put up in N. S. Wales. Of these 6972
were in Greater Sydney—the area which has
become Million Town. Another 553 were in
Newcastle and suburbs. That left 2185 for
the rest of the State —the vast region in
which is all the pother about “decentralisa-
tion,” and “settlement,” and the “breaking
up of big estates.” The amount borrowed
during the past 11 years for the purpose of
promoting the development of the rest of the
State in one way or another, for all loans
are supposed to point that way, has been
over £85,000,000. It has produced Million
Town, if it has done nothing else. So when
Sydney passes Rio (founded in 1531), and
begins to race Buenos Ayres (founded in
1535) for the population stakes of the
Southern Hemisphere, there is every reason to
be hopeful about the result. There are cer-
tainly six cities in the globe with more inhabi-
tants that the whole of N. S. Wales- —nearly
four times as many in one case—but then
“the whole of N. S. Wales” isn’t the matter
in debate. By concentrating the public ener-
gies on Million Town the result has been
achieved that that city has passed Rome,
Madrid, Cairo, Alexandria, Naples, and all
manner of historical places with names that
are as old as the hills. The aim of its
backers seems to be to make it resemble an
immense new tenement-house on the edge of
a deserted plain, and by the present look of
things they are succeeding.
The Countless Yankee Politician.
Uncle Samuel, the really rather humorless
person in the bird-of-freeclom pants and the
two-gallon hat, has announced that Britain
must pay in full the debt it incurred to him
when it was out in the tented field helping
to save civilisation and he was in the
tainted counting-house making money out of
the ruin thereof. The announcement may
seem a trifle superfluous, seeing that old
John Bull, whatever his failings, always
has paid, and has undertaken to do it this
time also. Even when he made a bad bar-
gain he never repudiated, after the fashion
of some of the States of the Union which
“ran a moist pen slick through everything
. and started fresh,” when the wild and woolly
administration of the post-war days made
their obligations irksome. Further, the
United Samuel has declined flatly to accept
3 per cent, interest while Bull’s debt exists,
not. because he scorns to take advantage ol'
the distress of an ally and brother, but be-
cause it isn’t enough. Also, he is reported
to have refused to take the British West
Indies in settlement, though there is no
record of the islands having been offered. Yet
it is understood that a large U.S. partv (.but
perhaps not yet a large enough party ) badly
wants these Indies. This party includes
the common or garden type of oversea
empire-builders, who want to pursue the
good work which began with the acquisition
of Alaska in 18(57, and was followed up with
Hawaii (1898), Porto Rico and Guam
(1898), the Philippines (1899), the Danish
Indies (1916) and bits of Samoa (sundry
dates). Then the liquorites and Pussy-
footers are said to be interested, either out
of a desire to cut off the rum supply at the
roots or a craving to secure the source of
that nourishing drink, the national stomach
being fed up with assorted brands. Per-
haps both ideas are involved, this being a
world of mixed motives. In addition there
are disappointed place-hunters and jobless
politicians who yearn for new worlds to
exploit. In “God’s Own Country” 7964
legislators legislate as a steady thing— 96
Federal Senators, 435 Federal Representa-
tives, 1772 State Senators and 5661 State
Representatives. This is taking no account
of 24 partially-frozen members at Juneau
(Alaska), 45 (not frozen) at Honolulu
(Hawaii), 50 in Porto Rico, 33 in the
Virgin Islands and 115 in the Philippines.
So the entire political army of the republic
numbers 8231 on a peace footing. Aus-
tralia musters 649 law-makers of all sorts,
which isn’t half so bad as most people have
been taught to imagine. Australia has
only 90 members in its biggest Cham-
ber (for 2,150,000 people), so we have no
such freaks as New Hampshire .(U.S.).
which has 443,083 inhabitants. 9341 sq.
miles (a little more than one-third the area
of Tasmania), and 422 paid members in its
State Lower House. On the same popula-
tion basis Sydney alone would elect about
950 members to Macquarie-street. Two
small States, out of the 48 which make up
Uncle Sam’s republic, actually elect 680
politicians to their Lower Houses alone.
They are New Hampshire and Connecticut,
and the two combined measure 14,345 sq.
miles. The real point at issue, however, is
that a country which had 8231 successful
candidates at last election is always liable
to have 16,462, or even 41,155, defeated
ones, all in search of fresh openings. So
if the British West Indies could be added
to the great Uncle Sam empire, willing poli-
tical toilers in abundance would be available
for digging up the new field of usefulness.
Whether our Uncle, craving for more terri-
tory, craving for the return of all his dollars
with the highest legal rate of interest,' but
not craving to add largely to his stock of
niggers or half-breeds, would be willing to
frankly accept Canada in settlement of his
bill is a matter for interesting conjecture.
What J. Bull, in London, would frankly
remark if the proposition was put before
him is another topic for deep reflection. And
there is victual for purely abstract specula-
tion in the thought that difficulties may keep
rising about the date of repayment, which
Uncle wants to be sooner than convenient,
and the rate of interest, which he desires
to fix so high as to be dashed inconvenient.
Beyond that is the possibility that the Bol-
shevik volcano or some other public crater
may blaze up, and make any kind of pay-
ment or repayment a matter of the very
indeterminate future. Then, perhaps, among
the 8231 politicians some (or many) may
be found to propose that the Republic should
take temporary and quite friendly possession
of Canada as* security, there being no de-
fensible frontier most of the way, but only
a streak laid on a flat immensity. No one
has ever seen our Uncle contemplating the
possible loss of a thousand millions or so
sterling, so no one can tell what the madden-
ing effect might be.

Freedom of Conscience.
Several Presbyterian clergymen in N. S.
Wales have been telling what they believe to
be the truth about the Bible, much to the
annoyance of the less enlightened. The Rev.
John Edwards, ex-Moderator, remarked: —
To treat the Bible as if it were the last word
in revelation, or, indeed, as if it contained within
its covers the only and entire revelation which
God has vouchsafed to man, is ethically repugnant.
Take, for example, the New Testament. Its respect-
ive writers did not ever dream that they were all
collaborating in the production of an infallible,
divine text book.
Also, the Rev. T. Jamieson Williams, of
Manly, said: —
The Bible was, and is, primarily a Jewish com-
pilation. Its value for us does not consist in wrench-
ing sundry texts from its pages and quoting them
indiscriminately, as if we were the people for whom
the writers penned their books, but in a sane attempt
to grasp and apply precisely the same principles
of honesty and sincerity which the writers of the
Bible themselves exemplified.
It is a cheering thing to the layman to read
this sort of thing, not only because it indi-
cates the strides some churches are making
in culture and tolerance, but also because
the fact that it is possible for such views to
be expressed publicly constitutes a proof
that Australia is not quite such a shackled
country as the persistence of a number of
war-regulations over four years after the
finish of the fighting might lead foreigners
to believe. Strictly speaking, these clergy-
men are liable to be prosecuted under the
Blasphemy Laws, which impose severe penal-
ties for those who question the infallibility
of the Scriptures. (For that matter, in
England, only last year, one Gott actually
was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to
nine months’ imprisonment under one archaic
measure.) From time to time —and more
particularly when a general election or row
within a Party is in progress—politicians
of a certain stamp seek to make capital by
discovering blasphemy and sedition in Social-
ist Sunday-schools or elsewhere, upon which
they proclaim their intention to take dras-
tic action. In the same spirit the politicians
of a few centuries earlier proceeded against
those allegedly dangerous characters who
denied the existence of a personal devil,
horns, tail and all. while earlier still the
Pagan rulers dealt severely with those
Christians who derided the national religion
and its gods. The essential difference be-
tween blasphemy and sedition,’ in the legal
sense, is that one is a criticism of Church,

the other of State; one of the nation’s
methods of worship, the other of its methods
of government. It has been recognised for
years by most people that so long as criti-
cism does not go far enough in either direc-
tion to endanger the peace it can do no
harm. If it is captious or futile it must
fail in its object, but where it is sound it is
bound to do good, because nothing is so
salutary as the truth. The right principle is
that any free citizen should be allowed to
assail whatever dogma, belief or law he
chooses, and where he thinks a wrong exists
strive to have it reformed. He may deny the
infallibility of the Bible, like the Rev. John
Edwards, but so long as he refrains from
interfering with those who affirm that the
Bible is infallible he should be immune. He
may deny that W. M. Hughes is a trust-
worthy Prime Minister, and provided he re-
frains from libel he should not be exposed to
the danger of anything in the nature of a Use
majeste prosecution. He may teach that, in
the sight of Heaven, civil marriage is no
marriage, and divorce a farce, but only if he
publishes the charge that individual citizens
are “living in sin’’ should he be open to pun-
ishment. The attempt to deny any of these
elemental rights by legislation has always
led to conscientious objectors, martyrdom
in one form or another, and eventual failure ;
and there, is little likelihood that things will
be any different in modern Australia.
The Proof of the Pudding.
There are Reds, extremists, where drink
is the issue, as in politics, religion and all
else. In Australia the chief enemies of the
wine industry are rabid alcoholists at one
end and rabid teetotallers at the other. These
people hurl masses of figures and contra-
dictory opinions at one another, with the
result that the impartial citizen is bewil-
dered. One type finds it easy to believe in
such, heroic adventures in reform as com-
munism—and prohibition; another is just
as sincere on the question of the divine right
of kings—and the claim of King Booze to
rule. On which side should the moderate
man, the sort who in politics believes in
constitutional methods, throw his weight?
The Yankees are aiming at a change calling
for a moral effort no less stupendous than
that which would be required to induce the
100 million inhabitants of the Republic to
share their possessions one with the other.
Most of the Australian States are making
no attempt to reach the terrific altitude of
sobriety which is the objective of Uncle
Samuel. Take Christmas, the period of
saturnalia which modern civilisation has
borrowed from the ancient pagan, and com-
pare the casualties in, say, N. S. Wales,
which, on the figures, is a more inebriated
State than Victoria, with those of prohibi-
tionist. America. In Sydney the police courts
were singularly free from Christmastide and
New Year “drunk and disorderly” cases.
Hundreds of thousands of town and country
people revelled at Manly during the week,
and, all told, one man was killed in a brawl,
said to have been inspired by drink. The
backblocks were soberer than the city, judg-
ing by the work imposed on the country
courts. In the U.S., according to the cables,
while Christmas was comparatively sober,
the New Year celebrations were deplorable
in both country and city.
In New York two men were killed and 18 wounded
during indiscriminate shooting in welcoming the
New Year. Seventy arrests were made of violators
of prohibition, and 57 arrests of hoodlums and
intoxicated persons. There were 18 cases of serious
alcoholism, and 15 serious automobile accidents.
The police made an heroic effort to stop drinking
in restaurants and thousands of outlying places
where celebrations were expected to be held.
Washington saw 170 persons arrested for intoxica-
tion, and at St. Louis three persons were seriously
wounded when the celebrants turned upon the
prohibition officers.
In other words, moderation has shown more
satisfactory results than extremism. Lenin,
after causing enormous bloodshed in an
heroic effort to impose communism, has gone
back to the capitalist system, which is the
constitutionalism of economists. Is it un-
reasonable to assume that, after a similar
effort to impose the despotism of prohibition,
the Yanks will get back to “constitutional-
ism” in drink reform?
In Defence of Hughes.
By “Henry Horsecollar” :
Apropos “Australia’s Seventeenth Century Prime
Minister’’ (B. 18/l/’23), I agree. unanimously save
as regards the action of Hughes in sounding Piuding-
ton, before making him a Federal judge, as to whether
his opinions were of the Federal or the anti-Federal and
State Fright order. In fact, Hughes’s action in
this matter represented almost the only thing which
Hughes ever said or did that I don’t thoroughly
object to. There are plenty of precedents. To
quote one: South Aus. began with one judge, Benja-
min Boothby, who had been appointed by letters
patent under the Great Seal of the Province. This
harmless and purely accidental frill so turned
Benjamin’s head that, as he wept over his grievances
in later years, the tears ran down his back. When
the Province acquired three judges, and Benjamin
wasn’t the Chief,' he took to explaining that he
was the only genuine article in the lot, the others
lacking his peculiar form of appointment. When
the Full Court sat he made preliminary snorts, sniffs
and protests against the presence of his learned,
but bogus, brethren. If I remember rightly, he
once acquitted the whole batch of prisoners without
trial because some harmless preliminary document
was signed, not by him, but by a bogus brother.
He died quarrelling to the last. Since then (.1
have this on dubious authority) when a new judge
is required in South Aus. the selected man is always
taken aside and asked: “Are you at all like Benjamin
Boothby?’’ If he says he is the offer is off.
Much the same thing happens at the election of
a Pope, who is a judge of the church in a world-
wide sense. (The Papacy isn’t hereditary, as some
people imagine.) When any cardinal is mentioned
as a possible choice for the supreme office he is
called upon to state that he is a Roman Catholic.
If he proves to be, say, a Baptist, his chances
end right there. Archbishops and bishops of all
denominations, who all exercise certain judicial func-
tions inside their church, have their opinions
similarly inspected.
I suppose the oath of office is also designed to
find out the applicant’s views—to discover whether,
if the case was so evenly balanced that his Honor’s
personal feelings had a chance to come in, his
leanings would be towards the Commonwealth or
towards the Communist push which takes its instruc-
tions from Moscow. Further, if Piddinqton had
been raised to the bench on a private issue— e.g.,
that he might approve, if necessary, of Hughes’s
mysterious gift of £25,000 —he would have been in
the same street as the English Chief Justice Hyde,
who was elevated to approve of Charles I. receiving
such gifts from his grateful subjects, and taking
them by violence if not offered.
But some things I do not understand, and I
would buy drinks for any man who could furnish a
satisfactory explanation. Why did Hughes so hunger
CUTTING OUT THE LUXURIES.
"The Dircctor of Naval Intelligence has announced that the battle-cruiser Australia, the light
cryuser Sydney, nine destroyers , six submarines, three sloops and other R.A.N. ships are to be paid off
“Sorry to lose you, lad, but with seven Governors and 14 sets of legislators and other
things of that hind to support, we can't run to superfluities."
and thirst to have Piddington on the instant, that
he cabled by deputy to him in Egypt, and thus put
things on record, when he might have breathed in
his ear on his return? Why as an alternative didn’t
he cable himself under the name of Smith, and have
no third party in the case? Why, if the appointment
couldn’t wait, didn’t he remember that there were
eligible barristers besides Piddington, to be seen
at any moment out of his window, whose views were
known, or were capable of being ascertained over
a cold soda by any diplomatic emissary? Why was
he so anxious for a judge who would help to restore
to the Commonwealth a power which Chief Justice
Griffith had ruled out, when the powers that
Griffith hadn’t ruled out left him quite cold? Also
whence came his later dislike for his pure but
ponderous Piddington? Hughes is a peevish mystery,
and does few things like other men. He even
falls off a horse in a fashion of his own.
The Double Moral Standard.
Dear B., —Although Kvloman is compara-
tively free, competes equally with men in
most occupations, and drives him out of
many, she still suffers from one bitter griev-
ance^ —that when she marries her husband
expects her to be virgin, yet does not admit
that she has the same rights as regards
himself. It is undeniable that sometimes
immorality on the part of a young man
may lead to horrible consequences to his
perfectly innocent bride; Ettie Rout has
done her part in rubbing that home in the
teeth of all the wowsers. To that extent,
if no other, woman is perfectly justified in
expecting to find her husband as pure as
herself. It is not jealousy that impels her,
nor even personal desire—though many edu-
cated women, especially in older countries,
get over the difficulty by satisfying their
passions, under the guise of “friendship,”
without the marriage ceremony until some-
one arrives with whom they could honestly
like to spend a lifetime. If we consider
what morals really are one expects to find
the woman’s point of view ultimately
established. Morals are a result of evolution
which has been found best fitted for the
survival of the race. The moral standard
is constantly changing; it has appreciably
changed within living memory—certainly
within the last century. Evolution in race-
morals is largely being carried on by speech ;
and as women are so much more fluent than
men, it is only natural that their point of
view is slowly being adopted by everyone.
When we gave up the right of private ven-
geance, substituting for it the rule of law
and universal suffrage, we unconsciously
took a great step towards the real rule of
woman. Even now men never exert them-
selves seriously in a direct physical contest
with women—biological instinct prevents
them, though they call it chivalry, courtesy,
politeness. Similarly, one expects that men
will ultimately surrender their sexual priv-
ileges—privileges that women cloak under
the euphemisms of “living their own lives,”
“seeing life whole,” and similar periphrases.
Everybody knows what these mean, though
nobody likes to express them in cold-blooded
English; that delicacy is a measure of the
victory that woman has already won. The
next step will be a definite adoption of the
equal moral standard. Men will console
themselves for giving up their privileges by
saying that they are induced to do so by
pity, chivalry—even perhaps by morality;
but the real reason will be the influence of
woman’s agile tongue. Biologically one does
things without knowing why they are done ;
thus children desire sugar without knowing
that sugar is the thing that is best for them
biologically, as a rule. And men will ulti-
mately consent to endure the physical mis-
ery and desire that so many women have
to suffer to-day in the unconscious endeavor
to preserve the ascendancy of the human race.
If an equal moral standard is the best thing
for mankind—and that idea is more and more
strongly held by both sexes —then un-
doubtedly it will be universally accepted; it
will be woman’s tongue that shall have con-
quered,, though we may not know it. The
race will be exceedingly unhappy until man’s
physiology changes to suit the new call upon
it, but ultimately both men and women wall
be happier and the race better fitted to
survive.—Roderick Hythe.

Dear Bulletin, —“N. Kayess” errs in as-
serting (“Our Hoarded Gold,” B. 16/11/’22)
that the Bank of England “lacks tangible
‘Quid for quid’ backing for its notes.” Last
week’s cable report showed that there was
held, against an issue of 144 millions, a
reserve in gold coin and bullion of
millions, or 87 per cent., the difference being
made up by millions’ worth of Govern-
ment and other securities. In pre-war times,
the issue of millions had at its back the
same 18-J millions of securities and 34 mil-
lions in coin and bullion, about 6*5 per cent.
The S per cent., mentioned by “N.K.,” of
bullion reserves in the British Treasury., is
held, not against “bank -notes,” but against
the Treasury notes, or “Bradburys,” issued
to replace the gold circulating in Britain before
the war. “N.K.” may deplore the seeming loss
on reserves of coin and bullion, but it
is a paradox of banking that the average
depositor is far more concerned about the
proportion of gold assets, which earn no-
thing, than about the various securities on
which most of the deposits are lent to earn
interest to their owners and a profit to the
lending corporation.—Yours, etc., J.A.H.
“H.H.”: The abandonment of the Roma
(Q.) oil bore (at least it was an oil bore, all
except the oil I signifies the end of a hole
which was old enough to be an institution,
and dilatory enough to be one of our
great natural resources. The district is sup-
posed to be the most promising in Australia,
and there was promise enough, but no per-
formance. Still, the Federal Government
has offered £50,000 reward for the discovery
of a real oil-field. This isn’t much in one
sense, for the finder of a robust oil-field
would probably be a millionaire and able
to scoff at £50,000, but as ground-bait for the
flotation of hypothetical oil-shows, shares in
which can be sold to the common or garden
mug, it has its uses. If the British Gov-
ernment offered £50,000 for the discovery of
a permanent goldfield in Ireland, that would
also have its uses. Even a big reward for
the finding of the buried treasure of the
buccaneer Smith, whose date, location and
existence are alike uncertain, would pro-
mote the formation of syndicates. Mean-
while the first factor in the case is that this
pathetically dependent country buys about
30,000,000 gallons of petrol yearly from
abroad, and its oil bill was close on £7,000,000
in 1921-22. The second factor is that the
country produces already over 1,000,000
gallons of power alcohol, which is better
and cheaper than Yankee petrol, from sugar
refuse, and getting on for twice as much
benzol from coal tar. This may not be
much as yet, but it is a great deal more
than the country has got out of speculative
holes, put down on the chance of striking a
gush of oil, or a pirate’s millions, or a Mel-
bourne Cup winner, and it shows the way.
Probably it is another case of plain hard
graft being the road out of the trouble.

Dear Bulletin, —In the tornado of misin-
formation, the Queensland cotton farmer was
informed that he should ratoon his last year’s
crop and break new ground for this year’s
sowing. He did. He abandoned pine-
apples, which were selling in Rockhamp-
ton last year at 3s. per dozen, and are scarce
now (imported) at 10s. He chased Straw-
berry off the immediate premises to the
outer pastures. He banished the unmelodi-
ous pig and the inartistic pumpkin, and
sowed cotton. Meanwhile, the ratoon plants
prospered and the continued drought frizzled
off such early seedlings as showed. Early
this year Craweord Vaughan’s Associa-
tion, which takes all the cotton purchased from
the farmer by the Government, suggested to
the grower that it would be a good thing to
grow all seed cotton. But as the represen-
tative of the guarantor preached the gospel
of the ratoon, no one stopped grubbing out
stumps long enough to take notice. In Octo-
ber last, some members of the British Cot-
ton Delegation burst over the horizon, saw
the ratoon crop, and never stopped denounc-
ing it until they fell off the conti-
nent on the Perth side on their way
home. Whereupon Theodore and co.
awakened suddenly, withdrew the subsidy,
disowned their expert, and filled the cotton
areas with enraged whiskers and foaming
farmers. The position now is that Craw-
ford Vaughan’s association loses nothing
by the deals, as the Queensland Government
protects it by paying on a standard of cotton
that was not promulgated until the farmer
was committed —at great cost —to this year’s
ratoons. The Theodore Government loses
nothing whatever excepting such confidence
as the farmers were misguided enough to
repose in it. The only loser is the farmer.
—Yours, Cleveland.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Australia—Commonwealth and States —
has a little matter of £170,000,000 to find
during this and the next couple of years. Of
course the money will be found: you can find
men to back the most hopeless-looking crock
in a race —it is all a question of the price
offered. The position with regard to these
renewals is that Australia has pledged itself
to pay this money, so, in the absence of sink-
ing funds, it simply has to borrow, and
when a person simply has to borrow or go
broke, the lender is complete boss of the
situation. It will mean at least £1,700,000
added to our annual interest bill; and that
is something over 255. to be paid by every
household. And not so much as a hank oi
twine to show for it.
A happy madness has come on the State
loan-mongers of Australia. Westralia,
which owed £124 odd per inhabitant 18
months ago (peace debt only), and naturally
owes more now, proposes to spend over
£4,000,000 more debt this year—say another
£l2 per head. N.S.W. has borrowed
£4,000,000 and the Premier is on his way
to look for £10,000,000. It was mentioned
prior to the £4,000,000 event that Ma owed
£180,000,000, and there have been remarks
about a liability of £10,000,000 to the Com-
monwealth, “not yet brought into account.”
So suspicions are entertained that Ma
really is in debt for Two Hundred Millions.
When the belated figures to June, 1921, were
published, Westralia and Queensland had
attained the pomp of owing more than £lOO
per head, and S. Australia has got there
since. If the Federal debt is added the
Westralians are past the £2OO-per-head
mark, and still booming along. Politicians
are judged by results, and if there is
sufficient loan money with which to buy re-
sults how can anyone prevent results? A
mere eleven years ago a show of prosperity
was kept up for £8,000,000 per annum.
Eleven years hence the hectic flush which
passes for national health may require
£60,000,000 of lOU money to keep it
burning.
In the early days of the Commonwealth,
when George * Turner steered the cash-box,
letter-postage was Id. and new works were
paid for out of revenue. There have been
various Treasurers since then, and various
Postmasters-General, including the bard
Webster, and things have changed. Postage
is 2d., and the vear’s postal surplus runs
to about £1,200.000, but, it being mostly
wanted for baby bonus, as much as
£3,000,000 is borrowed in a year for postal
and telegraph works, and the bonused baby
is left to pay the interest.
In their Anniversary Day heroics the Sydney
papers always dwell on the wonderful pro-
gress of the still more wonderful harbor they
dwell beside. For a change next year they
might buy three-penn’orth of ashes and
sitting among them reflect upon what has
happened to the other ports of N. S. Wales.
The State counts seven harbors apart from
Sydney, Newcastle and Ivembla (the. last
created for the loading of South Coast coal),
which are supposed to do a business in inter-
state and foreign shipping. They range
from Bailina in the north to Eden in the
south, and they are all old-established
centres. This is their record in recent
years: —
Shipping Entered and Cleared at Seven
N S.W. Ports.
1911.. 243,193 tons 1 1917.. 140,163 tons
1912.. 212,113 „ i 1918.. 42,949 „
1913.. 194,716 ~ I 1919.. 27,919 „
1914.. 111,188 ~ | 1920.. 29,395 „
1915.. 180,701 „ | 1921.. 24,273 „
1916.. 178,569 „ |
If the holiday-making citizen of N.S.W.
further takes into account the decline in
country-town factories, the drop since 1917
in the cultivated area, and the fact that the
census showed between one-third and one-
half of the country shires and municipalities
to be going through a steady process of de-
population, he may begin to fancy that Ma
used to be a more enterprising and pioneer-
ing, and above all a more self-reliant, female
than she is now.
To help the Premier of N.S.W. on his
loanward way, it was announced lately with
a great roar that for a grazing block of 1160
acres near Armidale there were 1061 appli-
cants. This was held to call for the imme-
diate finding, regardless of cost and at the
charge of posterity, of 1,229,600 acres for
the disappointed 1060, even if other people
had to be pushed off that they might go on.
The Bulletin is almost tired of throwing
the dead cat of scorn at such figures. The
land was valued at the very low figure of £2
per acre, and was offered for 15 years cer-
tain at 31 per cent, on that sum—probably

1 per cent, or less on its real value. It was
natural that, where the matter attracted
attention, men, women, boys, girls _ and dogs
should apply, and that whole families should
have a shot at the bargain. When anybody
offers to lend much money or money’s worth
for 15 years, with a prospect of renewal, at
1 or 14 per cent., he ought to get more than
1061 applicants, unless he has struck a dull
market and a sticky wicket. Even a mis-
anthrope who hated land so much that he
habitually slept on a raft anchored outside
the three-mile limit might strain a point and
come ashore for the occasion.
At Rockhampton (Q.) last week a lot
of State Nationalists and a few Cocky mem-
bers like Elphinstone and Peterson, the
quick-change artists, agreed to form what
they call a United party, and offered the
leadership to- Tom Glasgow. Tom, who
commanded the First Division in 1918, and
became a Senator next year, replied that
he'would think it over. Thereupon Vowles,
the Agrarian leader, genially intimated that
his party would be all the sweeter for the
secession of the gents, who have joined
the U.P., and while the tempest is raging
Theodore may decide that it is a good time
for a general election. Manifestly thte
Rockhampton delegates should not have com-
mitted themselves until the Commonwealth
Gnats and Cockies had completed their
negotiations in Melbourne. But there has
always been a plentiful lack of brains among
the anti-Theodore forces in Queensland.
From a Gallery man: —
The Melbourne papers are chiding Watt for his
aloofness. But he isn’t a Nationalist any longer,
and sheer pride prevents him following Latham into
the Cocky caucus, where, for the time being at
least, he would have to play the kettledrum or the
triangle in an orchestra conducted by Earle Page.
Watt simply realises that he will have better chances
later than, he has at present. He is, therefore, in
no hurry to become Prime Minister, and actually
has been so attentive to his private business that
he has hardly given the matter a thought.
Queensland Minister Coyne issues an
assurance that there is not the least fear
of the Labor Government losing the number
of its mess at the coming State election,
even though the party made a rotten show
in Federal elections in Queensland. In
other words: “You can trust us to win at
an election we manage ourselves, however
poor our luck may be at one we don’t
manage ourselves.” For the State election
of 1918 89.221 voters were discovered
more than the Federal authorities could
unearth; and apparently the Government
knows what sort of voters they are.
The defeat of both the Minister for
Defence and the Assistant-Minister for
Repatriation must make the Repatriation
Commissioners thank their lucky stars they
haven’t to face a similar ordeal.
Mentioned in the W.A. Assembly the other
day that W. N. Hedges, a former M.H.R.
and “the biggest farmer in the State,” had
been expelled from the Primary Producers’
Association for contesting Fremantle last
month (there was no C.P. candidate) as
“the nominee of another political party.”
Why Hedges wasn’t expelled before or ren-
dered ineligible for P.P.A. membership for
contesting the Swan twice against a direct
C.P. nominee wasn’t stated, nor why Cocky
members are allowed to sit with Nationalist
colleagues in the State Government. In any
case, to make acceptance of a certain politi-
cal creed a sine qua non of membership ot a
farmers’ association is the rankest of
bigotry.
A sort of inter-State jealousy has been
revived by the scuffle for .the Prime Minis-
ter’s billet. The Melbourne press, which is
favorable to Bruce and would holler for
Watt if he were available, was shocked to
discover a “Sydney movement on behalf
of Fl atten; and the Age solemnly warned
the conspirators that they would have to
fight Victoria for it. Of course, the real
trouble is that Pratten, who is strongly
supported by Austin Chapman, is suspected
of a readiness to further the latter’s gaudy
dreams of development at Canberra. Herein
lies a situation that Hughes may yet exploit.
If he showed a disposition to shy at further
expense on the Capital for the present, the
Melbourne papers would try to forgive him
for some of the. nasty things they have said
about him.
So many costly defeats have been suffered
by the A.W.U. since its general executive
dropped arbitration for direct action that
the latest annual conference was a melan-
choly business. As soon as the preliminaries
were over the delegates resolved that the
lawless strike against the Powers award
could consider itself called off, and. that
members of the union should be graciously
permitted to barber sheep next season at
award rates. Considering that the strike
collapsed months ago otving to thousands of
shearers accepting the Powers terms and
refusing to renew their union tickets, the
call in e-off and the permission were gloomily
superfluous. It was also decided that the
union would henceforth cleave like an oyster
to arbitration, as in the days of Spence and
Macdonell. But the effect would be more
impressive if what is left of the central
branch, in which the last and looniest
A.W.U. strike started, hadn’t re-elected the
same old gang of city ward-bosses to mis-
manage its affairs.
N.S.W. Minister Ball proposes to brighten
up the Railway Department. There is to
be one manager less, or six more, and some
of them are to be “departmental heads”
instead of Commissioners, and things are to
be “re-organised.” But as the management
won’t have control of the railway-building
job, and won’t have power to veto proposed
lines that haven’t a chance of paying unless
built out of revenue, and won’t be able to
insist on the construction of lines that it
knows will pay, the old shirt will simply
have a new tail, and the new tail looks
familiar. .
The Fuller Government’s heroic scheme to
“settle the land” and, incidentally, the other
political party recalls another heroic effort
of 62 years ago. John Robertson threw
practically all N. S. Wales, surveyed or not,
squatters’ lands included, open to small agri-
cultural settlers in areas of from 40 to 320
acres. He and others “settled” 23£ million
acres under this Act, and there has been
enormous settlement under other Acts. And
now there are 4i million acres, all told,
under crop in the entire State. Any fool
can “settle” people on the land. It takes
something better to put people there so that
they won’t immediately become unsettled
again.
“Lou”: An engineer in charge of a Queens-
land railway-construction job had all
arrangements made to close down for the
Christmas suspension on December 15. But
that chanced to be the day before the Federal
election, and orders came from Brisbane to
keep going until the 18th. To make assur-
ance doubly sure the navvies’ train was can-
celled so that they . couldn't get away. It
meant about 600 votes for the Labor man
and three days’ pay for a dim resemblance
to work. And the joke was on the Labor
wirepullers, after all, for although their
nominee polled a majority in that part of the
electorate for the first time, he failed to get
in. But the poor old public had to stand the
racket, as always.
Preferential voting may have one good
effect, so far as the Senate, at any rate, is
concerned—it may make some of the elected
men take more interest in their job. Before
the new system was introduced the lazy man
said: “What’s the use of doing anything?
As long as I’m a good party man, and win
the nomination, I’ll get in, if my party’s
on top, whether I do anything or not; if
it’s not on top. anything I do won’t save me.”
Rut it is different now, as Josiah Thomas,
for instance, discovered. Thousands of elec-
tors are not absolute slaves of party, and
Thomas hadn’t done enough to make even
the anti-Laborites among those thousands
trouble much where they put him on their
preference lists.

THE NEW PATRIOTISM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Persistence by France in the present policy of
armed burglary may lead to national disaster.’
Typical comment on the French effort to collect
nome of the German debt.
Dip your badge, Digger, try to hide that limp
When Loyalists start talking of the French:
Proclaim that Jacques was but a bragging pimp,
A small mean thief unfit to hold a trench
Against bold Fritz. When Fritz is praised, agree:
Forget Jacques helped to keep our Empire free.
You saw the ravaged places of the Somme,
The gracious churches ruined and defiled,
The homes in chaos —all the martyrdom
The French endured while cloistered Prussia
smiled.
These others didn’t, and the war is done:
Cheer for the chap they used to call a Hun!
When in the filthy Flanders ftime you lay
Waiting for zero-hour, and all it meant,
You thought the Germans would be made to pay:
“We’U search them,” cried Lloyd George, the
eloquent,
“For every sou.” But now the loyal know
That only burgling criminals talk so.
Forget the crape-clad women that you saw
(Not crape, but cr6pe de Chine is now the wear).
Forget the memories, that sear and gnaw
Of good friends gone. We must not malice
bear.
It is disloyal now the tradesmen say
That loyalty to swindled France won’t pay.

In pref. and ordinary divs. Dalgety’s dis-
tributed £175,000 to shareholders for the
year ended June 30 last, the ordinary div.
rate being lifted to 15 p.c. again. But the
accounts show that only £94,579 of that was
earned by regular trading during the period.
It was a “year unusually varied in its char-
acter,” says the directors’ report. One un-
usual happening was that the co. had in-
duced the British Treasury to refund no less
than £158,210 “excess profit dutv.” A sub-
stantial portion of it was taken to provide
a shareholders’ banquet. In addition, £20,000
of profit flowed into general reserves from
the sale of unspecified securities. After
paying divs., voting £lO,OOO to the staff
provident fund (making it £151,000) and
writing down premises another £20,000, the
fioul settling left reserves visibly larger by
£<><,7B9 on the year. The period was,
adniittedly, troublesome in many respects:
the markets for most lines in' which the
co. trades on an extensive scale were erratic,
Prices low and costs of handling high. The
Australian business was better than in the
previous year, but the Maoriland end had
not recovered to any extent. This shows
how some Dalgety figures have moved since
the boom year:—
„ „ 1920. 1921. 1922.

Taxes . . . . 186,241 134,858 204,015
Total outgoings .. £664,721 £548,562 £681,081
Gross profits are those disclosed after pro-
viding for contingencies, and, for the past
two years, after clipping allowances for de-
preciation.
The building up of large internal reserves
to protect the co. against all manner of pos-
sible troubles has been the feature of Dal-
gety accounts for many years. Supporting
the paid capital of 1| million—a million
in ordinaries and 4-million in 5 p.c. prefs.
—there are visible reserves of £1.101,901.
In addition, there are very large internal
reserves, some of which are made visible
without the application of X-rays. For in-
stance. the reserve fund investments of
£970,000 are public securities with an aggre-
gate face value of £1,269,540, almost
£300,000 having been written off. Some of
these stocks do not mature for nearly 40
years, and, unless the co. is compelled to
market them, individual parcels as they
mature will be the source of considerable
profit from time to time during that period.
On promises the co. has spent altogether
almost £790,000. yet they now have a book
value of only £225,000. During the past
10 years no less than £355,000 of profit has
been taken to reduce the book value of this
asset. No doubt, the more “perishable” lines,
such as advances, have also received the atten-
tion of the management. Those in respect
of land and station properties have probably
received very close scrutiny in recent years
owing to the inflated values at which many
of them were sold during the war boom,
particularly in Maoriland. In all respects,
Dalgety’s is a powerfully-built concern. It
was so strengthened in the war years that
probably nothing short of a national dis-
aster could now shake its foundations.
Besides the H million of capital and
£1.101,901 of visible reserves at w r ork, the
co. also has the use of large borrowed capi-
tal which it tied to the business in davs
when money was cheap. One lot of £1,725,544
of perpetual stock carries only 4 p.c. p.a.;
tor term debentures the management has had
to pay up to 64 p.c. during recent years.
Altogether Dalgety’s has £2,600,000 of
outside money. The next table shows the
rates which it pays for its borrowed capital
and also compares balance-sheet movements

The feature of recent years has been the
steady accumulation of public securities
and other liquid assets. Fourteen years ago,
prior to the raising of the half-million of
5 p.c. pref. capita], and when visible reserves
were three-quarters of a million smaller
than they now are, the co. had advances
on land, stations, stock, wool and other pro-
duce with a book value of £7,380,494, com-
pared with £3,826,569 at the latest balance.
Of the 1922 balance-sheet total of £8,409,477
no less than 3 J millions was in cash
and written-down public securities. In
its fat old age the co. appears to have
been seeking safety-first investments. Per-
haps, later on, when the Commonwealth has
quite recovered from the depression which
followed the war boom, Dalgety’s will re-
gain confidence and employ more of its funds
in assisting to finance the areas which pro-
vide its bread-and-butter.

The Hotel Sydney was an Arthur Rickard
enterprise: construction began just before
the war, on a strip of 50-year leasehold land
acquired from the City Council. The ven-
dors of the transferred leasehold received
the only ordinaries issued (£5000), but later
on they put up £lO,OOO more. The co. de-
pended on 8 p.c. cum. prefs. to meet build-
ers’ bills. Insufficient funds were forthcom-
ing, so the directors had to seek other assist-
ance—by debentures, overdraft, etc. Nowa-
days the co. is almost entirely an Arthur
Rickard Extended subsidiary: a couple of
years ago that co., which w r as already in-
terested in the ordinaries through another
subsidiary, exchanged two of its 7| p.c. cum.
prefs. for each Hotel Sydney 8 p.c. pref.
eligible for 10 p.c. Though ‘it is still an
independent co., Central Railway Palace
Buildings, Ltd., is part and parcel of the
Arthur Rickard Extended Co., and its affairs
must be considered in relationship to that
concern.
The Hotel Sydney has proved a very pro-
fitable venture. For the two years since
payment of divs. began 10 p.c. p.a. has been
paid on prefs. and for 18 months distribu-
tions on ordinaries have averaged slightly
more than 30 p.c. p.a. Though most of this
cash is going to the parent co., and that co.
may set aside a substantial amount in its
reserves, the hotel would be a sounder sub-
sidiary for the Arthur Rickard stable if more'
of its profits accumulated under its own
roof. Only a trifling £216 had been left
with it after the recent distributions. Should
the hotel experience a setback —and the best-
managed hotels have their lean years—it
has no reserves to see it through its troubles.
And that, in turn, would make the Rickard
Extended’s affairs less comfortable than they
would otherwise be. During the past six
months 5195 new prefs. were taken up, and
since 1916. when liabilities were at their
highest, the balance-sheet position has
altered in this way :

Assuming that earnings have lately been on
the scale of those for the October half, after
the div. had been paid at the end of December
the excess of liabilities over liquid assets was
probably about £33,000 and total liabilities
probably exceeded £40,000. This was mostly
overdraft, secured by mortgage debenture at
the Commonwealth Bank. That is not the
soundest method of financing an hotel enter-
prise, particularly one which distributes

There is a lot of sound Scotch caution about
the Mosgiel Woollen Factory, of Dunedin.
Over the dozen years covered by the intro-
ductory table paid capital has remained sta-
tionary at £83,457. and while earnings have
permitted the elevation of the div. rate from
6 p.e. to 11 p.e. visible reserves have ex-
panded £30,000 after setting aside £lO,OOO
for a fund for the benefit of incapacitated
employees. But the table does not give a
complete record of performances. A feature
of it is the large amount written off, and
this comparison of balance-sheet figures
helps to throw additional light on happenings
during the dozen years since 1910:
1910. 1915. 1921. 1922.
Liabilities.. . . £18,953 £12,345 £28,999 £29,438

Book debts .. 8,605 10,293 31,9.10 27,828
Cash, etc... .. 208 2,308 47,234 61,012
In 1910 the mill had a book value of £61,644.
Since then £47,810 has been spent on addi-
tions and replacements, but the writing down
has been so hard that the book value of
land, buildings and machinery at the latest
balance was only £41,356. An examination
of the liquid position shows in another way
how the co/s position has improved. At
the 1910 balance the book value of stocks,
book debts, etc., exceeded all liabilities by
£34,669; in October last the liquid surplus
was £100,095. So ih 12 years, after making
all necessary plant replacements, installing
additional machinery and paying good aver-
age divs., the liquid surplus improved £65,426.
When the latest accounts were made up
there was £25,607 of cash on hand and
£34,655 of Government securities. This
great strength has been developed by the
directors having adopted a conservative
policy when dealing with the handsome earn-
ings of the boom period. Instead of paying
large divs. or capitalising reserves they
gave first thought to assuring the co.’s
future. With plant written down hard and
large reserves supporting capital, the out-
look for the Mosgiel mill is bright. Share-
holders could have been excused if they had
taken a larger cut out of profits. The 6
and 7 p.e. divs. which were paid prior to
the war were mild returns, and, going back
still further, for the six years to 1909 they
had averaged only 4 p.e. p.a. However, the
co. is now in a position to develop its busi-
ness along sound lines, and shareholders
should be rewarded for their self-denial
during the abnormal period. 'The next com-
parison shows that, despite the troubled
times Maoriland has been experiencing, the
Mosgiel mill output has been giving larger
gross profits than in the boom years:—

The Speck State insurance office closed its
second year at .Tune 30 with an income for
the period almost half as large again as for
the first 12 months. It is transacting fire,
accident and marine business, but the former
is easily its biggest line. Of gross premiums
of £20,553. fire policies contributed £16,279,
accident £4050 and marine £224. The asso-
ciated underwriters have not taken the Gov-
ernment enterprise into the re-insurance fold
with any enthusiasm. General-manager E.
A. Reid naturally does not care to expose
his business and the Treasury to undue risk,
and last year used £6057 of premiums to
lay-off risks with other offices. In return
these offices responded with only £1822 of
their premiums. Hence this kick in the
g.-m.’s annual report:—
This position would not exist it’ insurance cos. met
their reciprocity* obligations before placing’ their sur-
pluses with outside treaty offices. No private insur-
ance co. would tolerate' such a heavy loss on re-
insurances, and, failing local reciprocity, would at
the earliest moment seek treaty arrangements. This
state of affairs is very much regretted, and other
arrangements on a more equitable basis will have to
be made. As a matter of fact, some of the Austra-
lian and New Zealand cos. do make an effort to
respond, but many of the British cos. make no attempt
to do so. If other and better arrangements are
made, then the insurance cos. in Tasmania will only
have themselves to blame.
The same stupid policy was adopted by
“vested interests” towards other Government
and co-operative offices in other States. In
most cases satisfactory treaty arrangements
were made overseas, and the efforts to stifle
the competition entirely failed. In view of
what has happened in Queensland, the pri-
vate offices in Tas. are ill-advised to con-
tinue a boycott of the Government venture.
The Tas. office’s underwriting record for
its two years has been as follows:—-

The Act made £20,000 available as capital
for the Department, but a temporary loan
of £750 was all that was required to estab-
lish the business, and that advance was re-
paid during the first year. There are now
reserves totalling £6776, £4842 of which is
set aside for unexpired risks (= 34.5 p.c. of
last year’s. premiums) and the balance
(£1934) is in a general reserve. The whole
of the costs of establishment in Hobart and
Launceston, furniture, equipment and a
motor-cycle have been met out of revenue,
and no portion of them figure among the
assets. At June 30 the balance-sheet total
was £7412: £5OOO in Tas. inscribed stock:
£1485 of cash and accrued interest; and
£927 of outstanding premiums.

The Fourth Victoria has been expanding in
great style. In the. early war years it pro-
ceeded very cautiously and allowed its busi-
ness to shrink. But gradually the manage-
ment regained confidence, and when other
sources of mortgage advances failed —owing
chiefly to heavy Government borrowings—
and unprecedented demands were made on
the building societies, it went in search of
additional funds to enable it to take advan-
tage of the exceptional new-business oppor-
tunities. The figures on both sides of the
balance-sheet have since grown rapidly.
Here are comparisons going back five years:
1917. 1920. 1921. '1922.

Since 1917 so much new business has been
written that, notwithstanding the repayments
of principal during the period, advances have
moved from £440,137 to £941,180, a net
increase of more than half a million in five
years. No new fixed capital was got in to
provide the funds necessary for the expansion,
but at October 31 £184,356 more had been
raised by issues of terminating shares and
£176.752 additional deposits were in the co.’s
care. Since the latest balance the directors
have offered 34,521 permanent shares of £5
each at a premium of £1 to take the place
of the terminating scrip maturing, and the
issue has been fully subscribed. Conse-
quently, there have lately been big changes
in the relationship of funds permanently
attached to the business and those on hand
for limited periods.
Though, owing to the flood of applications
for loans, managements have been in a posi-
tion to select their risks, the Fourth Vic. has
shown considerable pluck in writing so
much new business during a period
when building costs have been high,
labor and money dear, and values
generally more or less inflated. Unless con-
servative valuations have been made and
wide margins allowed, dangers would lurk in
new advances in the event of a slump. This
co. should not be caught in this way: it had
a gruelling once before, and the directors say
that they have “not lost sight” of the ab-
normal conditions. Also, one of the directors
is actuary E. J. Stock, general-manager of
the National Mutual Life, who has had many
years’ experience of weighing risks and

Incidentally, the Fourth Vic. discloses that
its £940.000 of loans is distributed over 2.>00-
odd borrowers, an average of less than £4OO
each.
This is not the first occasion on which the
management of this building society has dis-
played confidence in the future while others
have been nervous. The society survived
the ’nineties trouble less damaged than most,
and later decided to adopt some of the crip-
ples. It took over what was left of the
Lygon, Premier, South Melbourne, City of
Prahran, Planet, Economic and Melbourne
Permanent, and found the cleaning-up very
profitable when values recovered and old
properties were marketed. The last of the old
foreclosures was unloaded a couple of years
ago, and to support fixed and terminating
capital totalling £300,700, at October 31 there
were visible reserves of £163,000-<>dd. That
explains how the society has managed to pay
10 p.c. to shareholders and still have sub-
stantial surpluses for reserves. _ At the
balance depositors and other creditors had
their £508,390 supported by assets with a
book value of almost a million.

On the strength of bullish official reports
Mutooroo shares have soared. First report
on the new find at Transville (W.A.) stated
that the lode was 60ft. wide, 300 ft. long and
worth 35dwt. Later official reports inti-
mated there was good reason to believe the
formation between the two quartz lodes
would merge into one ore body, the lodes
being 6ft. and 4ft. wide and 16ft. apart.
Later again an official announcement was
made in effect that the manager believed
both ore bodies would merge into one make
of stone. There is much difference between
the formation 16ft. wide (and presumably
the lodes also) merging into one ore body,
and the two quartz lodes becoming one make
of stone. Country rock showing on sur-
face is porphyry, and that rock, when asso-
ciated with gold-bearing ore bodies at Hamp-
ton Plains, led anywhere but to dividends.
Possibly at the new find it will turn out
better. Meanwhile, there are three shafts
down to 10ft. on ore of reported width of stt.
and average value 35dwt. This comprises
all the work done to date. In these cir-
cumstances, buyers at present prices are tak-
ing considerable prospective ore reserves for
granted. Old Hampton Plains cos., such
as Lanarkshire, North West, Golden Vic-
tory and Hansel Mundy, have secured
options over areas adjoining or near the
new find, and as a result shares in those
concerns have had marked rises. Nothing
of note has so far been disclosed outside
Mutooroo blocks, but a mild boom is in full
swing, and if further developments be dis-
closed or even reported, it is hard to say
where it will stop.
* * * *
The Empire Syndicate, a Perth concern,
continues to disclose good developments on
the leases it has secured under option at
Sandstone. The lode is now 6ft. wide, value
2oz. Similar values have been obtained on
a lease a mile distant, and this is also
secured to the syndicate. If such develop-
ments go down to 100 ft., the find will look
about the best that has been made in West-
ralia for some years.
* * * *
Lancefield, at Laverton (W.A.), has been
purchased, lock, stock and barrel, by for-
ward, Down and Co., of Adelaide. Twenty-
odd years ago this show was floated by
Hoover and others as a “really big thing.
The shoot was long and wide, and the gold
was there, but production costs were P r0 ~
hibitive. After two fruitless reconstructions
a syndicate of Kalgoorlie mine managers took
it in hand and made money for a time but
ultimately an unsympathetic arbitration
award froze them out also.
Ingliston, Meekatharra (W.A.) has
stopped for want of funds. Already the
vendors have made considerable cash
advances, and the co. will most likely re-
construct to raise £lO,OOO for deepening the
main shaft. Eighteen months ago a promis-
ing ore body was disclosed between 43<tt.
and 487 ft., but, instead of continuing shatt-
sinking, the co. made the fatal mistake or
exhausting ore reserves above the latter
depth. This policy has naturally brought
it to a dead-end. On results achieved above
500 ft., the prospects don’t dazzle this paper.
Shareholders in Daisy Queen, late Hamp-
ton Daisy, have been loyal in the matter
of calls. The mine is at Lawlers, 80 miles
from railhead, and, after a big expenditure
in development and equipment, no ore re-
serves are exposed to justify the hope that
the mine will become a steady dividend-
naver. The reef is small, ground hard, and
average gold content of ore not high (about
13dwt.). If shareholders demanded closer
estimates of reserves, such disappointments
as have attended operations at Ingliston and
Daisy Queen would not be so frequent.
Brown’s Reward (W.A.) continues a
mvstery. With little ore exposed, it was
sold to Connor for £2500. Connor passed it
on to Brown’s Reward for £lO,OOO plus
40,000 fully-paid shares. The co. is now
milling 250 tons, and although the crushing
is almost completed not a word has been
divulged as to the size of the yield. Judged
by reported assays from developments, it
should be a good one; if not, buyers at 10s.
6d. will conclude —various things.
* * * *
Retaliation Reward (W.A.), which has
sunk two shafts 130 ft. apart to a depth
of 40ft., is now connecting them by a drive
on the lode. Unless some improvement is
disclosed in the drive, as compared with the
bottom of shafts, it will appear that the good
values met with during the early stages of
sinking are not going to be deep-seated.

The Queensland Government has decided
not to establish a State coal-mine at lujune
Creek, near Roma, and part of the area
thrown open has been taken by an Ipswich
syndicate, which is opening up one of the
seams. The only demand of any note is
from the Railway Department, and it uses
only about 15,000 tons annually at the Roma
and other western depots. Considerable bor-
ing has been done under the supervision of
Dr. Jensen, and a couple of workable seams
which may average 3ft. or 4ft. have been
located alongside the railway.
* * • *
Another discovery of cobalt has been made
at Cloncurry (Q.) in the direction of Mt
Cuthbert, seven miles west of Narraku
Siding. A shaft has been sunk 52ft. and a
crosscut at the bottom proved a formation
10ft. wide, of which 3ft. is expected to bulk
11 p.c., an exceptionally high figure. The
lode occurs on the contact of a large diorite
dyke and schist, and in that respect is iden-
tical with the Mt. Cobalt lode near Selwyn,
about 120 miles further south. The latter
is easily the most important cobalt lode
found to date in Australia, and high-grade ore
was shipped all last year to Europe, while
about £BO,OOO was spent on the concentrat-
ing plant and water supply. A large ton-
nage of high-grade concentrates should be
available for shipment this year.

The Billy Hughes, Normanby (Q-), is
in trouble, and is offering 50,000 reserve
shares (55.) to shareholders in lid. calls.
The last six months’ work has not turned
out well; only 75 tons are at present avail-
able for crushing. The 10-head battery, with
concentrating and cyaniding plant, is up,
but there is not nearly enough ore in view
to keep it employed, and the directors pro-
pose to spend £lOOO in finding some. The
Mines Department is being asked to subsi-
dise the call. There are prospects in the
winze on the 50ft. level, with a reef
wide which assayed 21oz. in the bottom.
The crosscut from the main shaft disclosed
a 20ft. formation, carrying sdwt., but this
will be no good unless they strike the reef
on the hanging wall.

Returns from Anakie (Q.) show an in-
crease in the turnover of sapphires. There
was practically no business in October, but
the November return jumped to 18l2oz.
f£3539), and December to 7150 z. (£1955).
The best blues are averaging £5 10s. an oz.,
but the bulk of the output is machine stone,
worth 4s. or ss. The market is unstable,
and the field still in the throes of depres-
sion.

The Vulcan, Irvinebank (N.Q.L has im-
proved, owing to a strike in the 560 ft. stope
off the intermediate level. All holes bored
there sample w r ell, according to the man-
ager. But this page wants details as to
the length the bores are in ore, and as to
the assay values. The last prospecting cam-
paign of the co. located small, rich •‘hoots,
and they could hardly have missed any-
thing big.

L. C. Ball, of the Queensland Geological
Survey, thinks Gympie may shine again. He
has been working out the stratigraphy and
faulting of an area around the Great North-
ern, and has concluded that a wedge of
Upper Gympie beds has been forced across
the auriferous belt between the Lady Mary
and Peter and Paul crosscourses, and that
under these the plumbago beds and the
auriferous slates should be found. This has
been an unsuspected hypothesis, and the
ground here has never been explored to any
depth. Ball describes it as a neglected sec-
tion, and further geological work will be
done on it. For the present diamond-drilling
is recommended at the Great Northern
Extended and the Lady Mary Leasehold W
shaft. At the former another 200 ft. should
bring in plumbago and the first bed of slate
somewhere about 550 ft. He thinks it quite
possible and even likely that this corner
of the field may yet prove as wealth-produc-
tive as any of the deeper ground south-
wards. It looks the best chance of a revival
that Gvmpie has seen for a decade. No. 4
North Phoenix erushings have given a fillip
to the prospecting craze, so the time is ripe
for carrying out the drilling suggested.
* * * *
The south-west corner of Stanthorpe dis-
tinct is supplying all of Queensland’s outnut
of white arsenic, the Jibbenbar State mine,
the Sundown and the Beecroft being all
there. For December the State mine turned
out 50 tons, bringing the quarter s return
up to 147 tons from 1500 tons ore treated.
The retail price has been reduced to £42. The
Sundown, mine and works, run by Arsenic,
Ltd., has had an unsatisfactory spin lately
owing to trouble with the plant, but the
mine looks well. A few years back it was
worked solely for tin, and was very rich.
The ore is a rather unusual mixture of tin-
stone, mispickel and copper pyrites. Now
the by-products are tin and copper, and
combined are worth nearly as much as the
arsenic. The Beecroft will be treating ore
shortly. O. C. Roberts, Ltd., has put up a
plant at Wallangarra.

Mines Minister Jones has beer*, handing
out subsidies to try to resurrect Croydon
(Q.). He visited the field last November
and handed out £5OO to reopen the Wara-
tah and get a battery up. The Waratah
South came in for £2OO. Croydon’s main
hopes are centred on the Iguana Consols, on
which a pot of cash went into an elaborate
four-chambered shaft, down 340 ft. As usual,
funds ran out when the job was half-done,
and the Minister is being asked to help to
get the shaft down to TlOft., at which depth
boring has indicated that the Iguana reef
will be hit. It is probable that a small pros-
pecting shaft will finish the journey to see
whether the reef is worth while.

The expensive Lady Jane at Mungana
(N.Q.), which is to be the successor of the
Einasleigh State Mine, has been put in shape
to a depth of 300 ft. and the upper levels
clejaned up. Thev expect to be on payable
ore at 310 ft. There was no question as
to the richness of the lode when the mine
was closed down after the fire, but it is very
debatable whether it is going to turn out
profitable at the present price of copper,
plus the heavy water they strike in the lime-
stone formation.
* * * *
New Blue, Bendigo, put up its record
last week with 7070 z. from 640 tons. The
mine is looking well, particularly in the
1600 ft. level south, where very rich ore is
being mined 12ft. wide from the eastern
side stopes; this run may eventually make
over to the centre formation, known as the
North Blue reef. These -workings, which
are 300 ft. from the boundary, make South
Blue look good.
* * * *
For months past The Bulletin has
tipped that Ulster (Bendigo) had a big
chance. Last week it was stated that there
was a steady improvement in the values of
the lode driven north at the 1600 ft. The
latest is that the lode has become very r'ch.
In less than a fortnight shares have jumped
over 500 p.c. This development ought to
lead to resumption of prospecting in the
Londonderry.

Bendigo Amalgamated having discontinued
mining work, the principal areas having
been transferred to “pups,” it is proposed
to make a return of capital. In a few weeks
a distribution of Is. per share will be an-
nounced. It is anticipated that there will
be about 3s. 9d. per share to divide, and
this will be spread over about two years.

Broken Hill Prop, will probably take
advantage of the earliest propitious oppor-
tunity to make an issue of shares to provide
means for steel-works extensions, and,
probably, for the initial work on the exten-
sive coal-land at. Maitland recently acquired.
As to future working of coal properties,
there is difference of opinion among the con-
trolling powers as to whether this shall be
undertaken by the present co., or be trans-
ferred to a subsidiary.

Experts who have examined the Verdun,
at Dark Corner (N.S.W.), are doubtful
whether the gold occurrence is in a true
■lode formation. It is assumed that it. is
merely a local “bunch,” but it is a very rich
one. The district has been noted for its
rich patches, and for many years had the
Paddy Lackey, which was worked with con-
tinuous success to about 700 ft. by a private
co. Taken over then by an English co., it
shared the fate of dozens of others and
became merely a memory.

Federation tin, Heemskirk, got on the
rocks so fast when tin slumped that it has
taken 25 months to screw a report out of
its officials. J. B. Lewis resigned as consult-
ing engineer; legal-manager Stringer cut his
own screw in halves ; the Board dropped fees
after June, 1021 : Alec Campbell drifted off
the Board ; 40,000 shares went back to the
co. As luck would have it the battery bought
from the Tasmanian Co. was paid for before
the smash of the metal market, so the for-
feitures are rather a blessing—with tin up
they are available to raise funds to bring
the battery on to the mine and set it going.
J. B. Lewis got everything ship-shape before
he left, so the craft is ready for final equip-
ment. Work appears to have corrected some
of the excess in ore estimates. Lewis’s final
report is that the cutting of the main lode
in the Long Tunnel added a block of 300.000
tons of “proved ore” to reserves. By punch-
ing into the Big Trench lode he can promise
to keep the battery going for years from
these workings alone. What is not told is
the essential: What are the average tin
contents of the ore? Until that is known
Federation cannot be measured up.

George Klug is back, but his stay is not
for long, for he goes to sit where Hoover and
Loring have sat, in New Babylon, as one
of the heads of 8., M. and Go. No need
exists to-day for so big a gun in Melbourne,
and it should be a distinct advantage to the
firm to have such a fascinator as Klug to
tone down the Moreing acerbity. No one
knows all that this very capable Australian
has done for the Zinc Corporation, for the
British Broken and for Port line. As he
won't blow his own horn and loves to shove
his selections on, he has the goodwill of all.
Everyone will miss him, but none will be-
grudge him his advancement.

Whaley, in the south-east of S.A., having
given it out that he is on the right track for
oil, the Mt. Gambier Associated Oil show
near by is pushing down its bore. . Depth
now is 1550 ft.—a lot below the horizon at
which old geologists said that oil could now.
The bore at present is in sandy brown shales
with waterworn particles of quartz up to
half-inch in size. The theory is that the
rounded sand is of an age that favors the
borer. It’s an ill bore that doesn t show
some “promising indications.”

The crushings from Queensland goldfields
during January should give 1923 a big start
on recent years. Normanby battery was to
come in with its initial run on Frederick
ore, and, although it will be nothing sensa-
tional, its output was zero last year. No. 4
North Phoenix, at Gympie, has a crushing
ready to put through its own battery just
erected. The Mount Coolon Co. has just,
cleaned up over 300 tons. The Coolon field
is pretty certain to beat all its past records
this year. But, so far, Queensland is the
only State that looks like showing a marked
recovery. _

gold for 1022 are 79.3320 z., valued at
£336,980. This is 40,591 oz. better than
1921. but Mt Morgan, which worked from
April to December, provided 49,5730 z. That
shows what mites the other fields have be-
come. Mt. Morgan shares have hardened,
and the omens point to this mine working
throughout the current year.

PEAPES' "WARREGO"
the Countryman's Shirt.
The immense popularity of I’eapes’
“Warrego” Shirt with men w T ho work
out of doors is due to its comfort, con-
venience, durability and splendid
washing qualities.
It does not, however, need washing
frequently, as it is made in blue, fawn
or grey pinhead designs that do not
readily soil.
It has two handy pockets with
button-down flaps and collar to button
down at peaks, and is strongly setvn
and reinforced.
Price 10/6 each.
Peapes pay postage.

LEPIT—An Actual
Breath of the Delightful
Blooms of Sunny Italy.
Almost every woman has heard of Italy’s famous
flowers —has scented in imagination their alluring
fragrance. But no longer are Fior di Notte (Flowers
of the Night). Ninfea (Lilies of the Water), Olea
Fragrans, Acacia, Cyclamen, Origanum, Mimosa,
etc., exotic fragrances to be just “imagined.” Lepit
makes them actually a reality, because Lepit Per-
fumes are the real extracts of these flowers.
Try a Face Cream and Powder of the same fra-
grance as your Lepit Perfume. They’re exquisite.

"and it's

WIMBLE'S INKS”
“10-2-4” : In my opinion a Heraldry course
should be made compulsory in all Austra-
lian schools, in default of legislation putting
remittance-men on the list of prohibited im-
migrants. Much bitterness of spirit and re-
crimination, as well as a considerable
amount of hard cash, might thereby be saved.
The reflection is inspired by the fact that
some days ago the Sydney dailies, with a
single exception, starred a social item about
one “Mr. Robert Mouutbatten (cousin of
Lord Louis Mountbatten).” The idiocy of
this item lay in the facts that the name
“Mountbatten” is only an alias, and that
those who were authorised to adopt it five
and a half years ago are definitely limited in
number. When the war began there were
two Battenberg families in England. Prince
Louis had two sons—George, who was in
these waters on the New Zealand just be-
fore the war, and Louis, of the Renown.
Prince Louis’s brother, Henry, was killed
in Ashanti in 1896, and he left two sons,
Leopold (who died of phlebitis) and Alex-
ander. In the middle of 1917 Prince Louis
HIS OWN FUNERAL.
“I am going to marry your daughter, sir.”
“Well, you needn’t come to me for sympathy. I have
troubles enough of my own.”
was made an English marquess and given
permission to Anglicise his German title into
Mountbatten (his sons ranking accordingly),
while Alexander, as Prince Henry’s heir,
was also created a marquess, and his brother
became Lord Leopold Mountbatten. In no
conceivable circumstances, therefore, could
Lord Louis yet have an adult commoner for
a cousin, much less an adult commoner
named Mountbatten. Manly, by the w r ay,
where Lord Louis’s alleged relative operated,
is a well-known stamping-ground for young
Englishmen of title whose names and mili-
tary decorations are not to be found in any
reference book. There is romance in the
air of the place, and it appears to have a
deteriorating effect on the inhabitants’ brains.
* * * *
“Thorold”: Everybody’s having a cut at
Malapropisms, and here’s mine. Adjutanting
at Kasr-el-Nil barracks, Cairo, during the
influenza boom and the push past Jerusalem,
I had to provide funerals for some hundreds
who were out of reach of their units. A
grim old sergeant, whose civil job was mor-
tuary attendant at Leicester Infirmary, Eng-
land, was fixing up the gloomy details. I
glanced through his records one day to find
a score of his cases where “cause of death
was given as “malingering malaria.”
* * * *
“A.P.8.”: Despite “Randolph Rentless”
(B. 11/l/’23) sharp juveniles don’t always
fulfil the promise of their youth. Brown and
Smith were two of my boyhood’s friends.
Their respective fathers were the local bank
manager and the local doctor. A grant had
been made available in our village, the centre
of a large fruit-growing district, for the pur-
pose of exterminating flying-foxes, and the
production of a pair of their feet at the bank
entitled the bearer to a bonus of threepence.
After business hours the manager would bury
the smellful takings of the day in his garden.
His son always noted the spot, exhumed the
claws each night, sorted out the best-pre-
served, and handed the same to young Smith,
who rolled up next morning with his trophies
and made hefty gaps in the funds. As he
possessed an old muzzle-loader, the little
game was never exposed, and by the time
the grant ran out the pair had cut up £2O
between them. No doubt those hoys should
have become Sussex-street egg-manipulators
or ended in gaol, but both are toiling hard
at the singularly unremunerative job ol
preaching the gospel.
« * * *
“Sucre”: llow’s this for the limit in hard
luck? Private Graham, A.1.F., was shot
through the head in France; then, patched
up, he took on flying, and fell out of an
aeroplane, breaking his back in two places.
He was shipped to the Anzac Hostel, Kan-
garoo Point (Q.), completely paralysed. Re-
cently, while being: taken out of bed, his
leg got caught in the framework, and was
broken. Yet there was one compensation
this time; being paralysed he felt no pain.
*** ■ *
“Tupu”: Recently the district nurse re-
ceived a call to the whare of an Austrian
gumdigger, near Ohaeawai (M.L.), to
assist at the arrival of the 12th nipper.
After it was all over, and the nurse was
preparing to depart, the proud father grasped
her hand, thanked her profusely, and wound
up with, “And where will you be this time
next year?”
“Wilfrido”: Maoriland can show a recent
case of a drunken motorist,- who left his
victim alone and drove on,
being, found guilty of man-
slaughter and then allowed
to come under the provi-
sions of the First Offenders
Probation Act 1920. Con-
trast the decision with one
given in another M.L. mag-
istrates’ court shortly after-
wards. A baker’s driver
met some friends as lie was
returning to the stables
after the day’s round. He
had a number of drinks,
with the result that he be-
came reliant upon Dobbin
to find the way home. The
police collared him, and he
was charged with being;
drunk while in charge of a
horse and cart. He re-
ceived a fortnight’s hard
with the option. I do not
suggest prejudice, but I do
. declare this: In the one
case the Law said, “Here’s
a wealthy man who has
accidentally killed someone.
Well, that might happen to
anyone who owns a motor”;
while in the other the atti-
tude was, “Here’s an em-
ployee found drunk and in
such a state that he might
kill somebody. Bakers simply
must not take this risk, and
if they do they must suffer
the consequences.” I don’t
know whether Courts that
do this sort of thing are
paid bv Lenin and Trotsky. They certainly
are the best apostles of Bolshevism we have.
«- * *
“P.X.”: European nations haven’t the
money to do for their battered soldiers what
Australia has borrowed to do, but they show
them a number of little kindnesses that we
don’t. In the hotels, instead of dipping
your hand into the match-holder and taking
as many lights as you want, you are liable
to find a cabinet of match-boxes and a slot
for a coin that Will go to the support of
some distressed soldiers’ fund, though, in
England, the Barnardo Homes are the big-
gest money-raisers in this way. In France
—the south especially—the hotels don’t
hand out stationery in the old lordly way
either; for 30 centimes you get a packet,
the proceeds of the sale going to the
mutilees of the war. And in the first-class
compartment of a French tram —most of
the trams run to two classes —you are warned
that you sit in certain select places at
your own risk; they are reserved for
mutilees and you must give up the seat if
any one of them comes in to claim it.

“Morob” considers the Chow: —
“Medea,” who asserts (B. 18/l/’23) that
Chinese go to Fiji, amass £lOO there, and
then move on to Australia or Maoriland, is
about 22 years behind the times. The Australian Alien
Immigration Restriction Act (1901) absolutely shuts
out Wun Lung. In pre-Federation days he could
SET.
"Yes: my wife is the dearest little woman on
earth.”
“Indeed , and what, then, am I?
“Oh, you — you're the most expensive”
get into N. S. Wales and some other States by
paying a poll-tax of £lOO. Nowadays, when a
Chink who was in Australia prior to 1901 wants
to visit his native land, he is given an exemption
certificate, which secures his re-entry when he, comes
back. As the majority of such “tourists” are
pretty old, with no intention of returning to Aus-
tralia, a great trade used to be done in these certifi-
cates in Shanghai and Hong Kong, until the Federal
Government bethought itself of the finger-print sys-
tem. At present, few Chinese evade the immigra-
tion barrier except such as can sneak into the
inadequately-guarded North, or the occasional one
who deserts from a ship and evades capture. It
ia probably true that there are more Chinese here
than there should be, considering that none are sup-
posed to have come in since 190.1, and that many
must have died or left in that period; but it is
doubtful if the excess is enough to do any economic
damage.

“L.E.” : Arthur Streeton urges. Melbourne
not to condemn too hastily the £30,000 Van
Eyck if at first sight it appears dark. He
blames our “dismal gallery,” with its bad
lighting, bald walls and dreary corridors,
for certain other fine pictures going down
at least 50 per cent, in their appearance.
The artist’s criticism is just. Melbourne
needs a new gallery. At present the. pic-
tures are hung anyhow; and the public is
not altogether to blame for its supposed
indifference to many so-called masterpieces.
But, after all, have we so many master-
pieces? We have works by Watteau, Gains-
borough, Reynolds, Raeburn, Turner and
other famous men, but few indeed could
be called good examples. We could hardly
expect the very finest works of these
Masters; but at least we want something
characteristic, not a collection of great
men’s failures. What idea would we have of
Shelley or Wordsworth if we had only
“Queen Mab” or “Peter Bell”? We are get-
ting more than our fair share of the
“Peter Bells” and “Queen Mabs” of paint-
ing.
* * * *
“Coot”: Mildura (Vic.) claims the Aus-
tralian record in 1922 for the “right class
of immigrant.” The birth registrations aver-
aged 36.83 per 1000, which is practically
50 per cent, better than the aggregate figures
for the Commonwealth. A baby was born
last year for every 28 people in the irriga-
tion district. And there were more than
four times as many births as deaths.
“Howitzer” : Amazing impersonations hap-
pened frequently during the war, but for
sheer audacity I always remember this.
Bluey, during the course of a good time
A.W.L. in Cairo, stole a major’s outfit from
the mess in a camp at Zeitoun. The clobber
proving an excellent fit, he picked up a pal
and transformed him by a similar method
into a captain. The two warriors proceeded
to Shepheard’s in the borrowed plumes. After
hectic days they were arrested for assaulting
a brother majah in the hotel lounge. The
amazing facts were elucidated at the subse-
quent court-martial, which further ascer-
tained that the interesting pair had repre-
sented themselves as pay-officers for a base
detail camp near Cairo, and drawn the
camp’s fortnightly pay, over £lOOO. They
got off lightly with three years’ apiece.
“F. Clinton”: All have heard of the
catacombs of ancient Rome, but how many
know of the catacombs
of old Sydney ? When
Thomas Holt built The
Warren, overlooking
Cook’s River, not far
from where Temne now
stands, he provided his
own grave, and saw to it,
too, that his family was
not neglected. Just above
his picturesque boathouse
and close to the present
pipe bridge was a shal-
low cave. Here he builded.
A low wall holds in a
pathway which winds
down to the cave, and
this wall hides the cata-
combs from the view of
those below the path.
Neither Thomas Holt
nor any member of his
family was ever planted
there. But it was used
once, for all that. Years
after he had left the pro-
perty and departed for
the Cold Country, the
Carmelite nuns —a closed
order —took over The
Warren as a nunnery;
and on the death of one
of their number the sisters had her
bones laid on one of the shelves.
The local bumbles, however, objected,
and the body was removed. Now
broken masonry at the entrance to the cell
and the blank space in the wall where a tab-
let was fastened are all that remain to
indicate that the quaint graveyard was ever
used.
„ * * *
“X2X” : During the past year or so, that
potential scourge of Northern Australia,
hookworm, has been appearing on the Clar-
ence River (N.S.W.). A recent examina-
tion of school-children revealed several cases.
Where the sanitary arrangements are primi-
tive, as they are nearly everywhere on the
N.S.W. North Coast, the tiny worm, Anlcyl-
stoma duodenale, gets into the soil, and, once
established, is not easily eradicated. It
enters the human body through the soft skin
MORE EXPENSE.
GERTIE : “Poor woman —I think divorce
ought to be made easier!”
BERTIE : “Lord save us—no. Look at Mrs.
Brown. Three divorces and four mar-
riages. And each time I’ve had to part
up a wedding present.”
that covers the arch of the foot, and in a dis-
trict like the Clarence River it is hard to
keep children from going barefooted through-
out the greater part of the year. The first
way to attack the parasite should be through
an educative campaign directed at children
and parents, impressing on them, to begin
with, that A. duodcnale is helpless against
a shod foot.

FEBRUARY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A red, dull, purple haze that lingers still
Proclaims the way the fierce December went
In sudden wrath, with awesome flames bespent,
As if on blood some savage gorged his fill.
Lean January, like a vulture shrill,
Soared o’er the waste on evil missions bent,
And, at the dried creek, flapped her wings and
sent
A shower of sullen sparks across the hill.
Now, dazed, we watch the skies and almost pray,
We are so sick of fiery red and black,
j'rown desolation stares from every side,
And there is not one day one does not say,
“Come, February, take the bridle track,
And through the land your wild, wet horses ride!”

A note from a librarian:—
Though fines are imposed for wilful damage to
lending-library books, the culprit has first to be
caught. This isn’t always easy, for the damage
may have been committed four or five borrowers
back. And, generally, the subscriber can’t swear
one way or the other—one rarely keeps the book
always in one’s own hands. An old lady who
brought in a book from which the illustrations had
been removed said that, certainly, her maid had
“artistic tastes” and had been known to cut out the
pictures from a book. When asked was it not her
daughter, “Thank God, no!” replied the dame with
dignity, “my daughter has no artistic tastes.”

“Sucre”: “Anaf’s” reflection (B. 18/l/’23)
on the execution of female murderers, here
and abroad, takes me back to June 13, 1887,
when Ellen Thompson and John Harrison
were hanged in Boggo-road gaol, S. Bris-
bane, .for the murder of William Thompson,
the former’s husband, near Port Douglas
(N.Q.), nine months earlier. There were
resemblances, to the recent Bywater-Thomp-
son horror, but there were differences, too.
When the woman, a frail creature, dis-
appeared down the trap, it was with the
cry, “Oh, my poor children! Take care of
them.” Harrison sank through the same
aperture half-an-hour later in silence.
Thompson was the last female to hang in
Queensland.

“Lex”: Sydney’s new Metropolitan S.-M.
Peisley has introduced another wholesome
departure from custom. It is illegal for the

police to cross-question arrested persons
without warning them beforehand of the
possible results of any confidences they may
make. But as nine people out of ten are
more garrulous when arrested (unless they
happen to be experienced criminals) tlmn
at most other times, the law is constantly
broken in the interests of what the con-
stables miscall “justice.” Lately a police-
man appeared before Peisley with a sheaf of
evidence obtained in this way from a woman
to support a charge of larceny, and to his
astonishment had it ruled out. The con-

stable had grown so used to disregarding the
law that he didn’t recognise it. There is
another reform which this unconventional
magistrate might initiate in his jurisdiction
with advantage, and that is the abolition
of the present police-court practice of assum-
ing every accused person to be guilty.
Granted that the business of these congested
courts has to be put through with despatch,
and granted further that an enormous per-
centage of those placed in the dock are
guilty, it yet remains a blot on our system
that' the police are invariably believed,
though usually, where the reputation of a
rich man is in question and experienced
counsel participates, the police are shown to
be more concerned at that stage about get-
ting a conviction than exposing the whole
of the facts.

“0.P.”: A famous Ballarat Methodist
church, which links up with the gold-rush
days, has been converted by the School of
Mines into a fine museum. Most of the
well-known preachers of an earlier time —
Watsford, Ivelynack, Bickford, Dare and
others —thumped its pulpit, and the old
church never knew what it was to suffer
from empty pews. The present generation
dozes more comfortably in the largest
Methodist church in the Commonwealth, a
few yards further down Lydiard-street,
where there has recently beep erected a
memorial window which challenges com pan-
son with anything of the kind in Australia.

“L.S.”: Picking up Burke’s “Colonial
Gentry,” a gorgeous work now long out of
print and full of the glories of dazzling people
who are described as “Jones, of Sydney and
Wollongong,” or “Smith, of Melbourne and
Widgeegoara,” I could find only one single
wight with sufficient courage to break
through the father-to-son tradition which so
cramped the style of his fellow-climbers.
Here is his dignified version:—
Lineage.
Mr. comes ot a. very ancient .Jewish
family, being a Cohen, which gives him an undis-
puted genealogy of some 3400 years.
“Gaza”: On these hot days a teacher
friend of ipine psychologically modifies the
temperature of his class. He says: “When
the boys are languid, a song about the ocean
or river freshens them up like a swim. And
in winter, when their teeth are chatter-
ing, a few rounds of ‘Home to dinner, hear
the bell. Bacon and potatoes all done well,’
soon gives them a ruddy glow.”
* * * *
“Yardley*: Some recent charges against
the stewards of a Commonwealth ship by
lady passengers recall the judgment of an
Indian court. A century of usage per-
mitted “Father Neptune” to come aboard
and “shave,” with various unpleasant
accompaniments, voyagers who were cross-
ing the equator for the first time. Eventu-
ally a joke grew into an abuse, and a»
unpopular passenger fared badly ■when the
custom of the sea licensed the crew to pay
off old scores. At last a victim sought
protection of the ship’s master, only to be
laughed at. Upon arrival at Bombay he
took legal action. The judges ignored the
plea of custom, and damages were assessed
at a figure which laid a blighting hand upon
the time-honored usage of the seas.
“X2X” : It is a curious fact that for some
years past typhoid fever has beeu decreasing
along the eastern slope of Australia, despite
the fact that iu this area there are many
populous towns without a decent sanitary
system or anything like one. One explana-
tion offered is that the conclusion of the
war put back into civil life many men who
had been inoculated against typhoid; but
this would not account for the slackening off
of the disease amongst women and children.
It is more likely the operation of a slowly-
working, natural immunity in a certain area,
which encourages the hope that typhoid may
ultimately be stamped out in Australia. Sucii
a phenomenon has happened with other
diseases in other quarters of the world.

“Bouragi” on Papuan progress:
Some time ago I wrote in bitterness of spirit on
the modern swank which has led Papua to employ
a white hangman. But that, it seems, is only the
beginning. In the latest Papuan Courier I find
a Port Moresby man advertising motor-cars and
giving a ’phone number! Another firm advertises
“gents’ knitted ties.” When I knew this establish-
ment the only haberdashery it featured was white
(■and not too white at that) pants. Another concern
offers cheese. The only cheese we got in my day
was a potted American article that advertised itself.
Onoe, when a travelling Australian Senator visited
me, I carelessly banged down a new pot of this
delicacy in front of him on the table. The lid flew
off with a bang and hit the rafters, and though the
Senator had sat on several Royal Commissions the
bouquet was a bit too thick, even for him. There’s
no doubt about it —Papua moves.

“Batman” : There is a man I meet on a
purely business footing whom, until yester-
day, I always regarded with some amuse-
ment and contempt. He seemed to be too
greatly interested in his clothes, was always
over-dressed, wore socks that screamed for
derision. What changed my opinion was his
unaffected and hearty greeting of a sweat-
grimed and unshaven man who was driving
a trolly past where we stood. “Know him?”
I asked. “Know him !” reiterated my dressy
friend joyfully. “Why, I cleaned his boots
for him in France!” His carter friend had
been a major in the A.I.F. and the other,
of course, was his batman.

“Donalbain” goes back 110 years:—
N. S. Wales was threatened with a Yankee invasion
long before pugs, pictures and chewing-gum began
to drift across the Pacific. Early in 1813, during
the last war between Britain and the U.S., the
Yankee frigate Essex rounded Cape Horn and began
to make hay of the British whalers in the Pacific.
According to information given to the British
authorities by Jorgen Jorgenson, who knew a lot
about that sort of thing, two French frigates were
to have crept out of Brest and joined the Essex at
the Falkland Islands. In fact, Jorgenson says that
they did get out, but were wrecked near Cadiz. Any-
way, they never joined the Essex, and the latter did
not try by herself the plan, mooted 10 years before by
Peron, of a landing in Broken Bay and an advance
on Sydney. Instead, her captain, David Porter,
built a fort on the Marquesas, and, with that as a
base, captured 17 British whaling vessels. Most of
the prizes were burnt, but the Seringapatam, cap-
tured off the Galapagos on July 13, 1813, was fitted
out with 22 guns for use as an auxiliary raider. On
May 6, 1813, she was lying off the fort, when 14
British seamen took advantage of the absence of
the Essex to rise and overpower the American prize-
masters. They spiked the guns of the fort and got
clear away in the Seringapatam. Is one of them
knew anything about navigation. But they reached
Sydney, where Joseph Underwood, acting on their
behalf, annlied to Judg'c Bent to have the recaptuied
ship declared a lawful prize. Bent referred it to
the British Admiralty Court, and the 11 heroes, with
that veterun sea-dog Kbor Bunker as captain, sailed
her to London. As for the Essex, her run was cut
short. She met the British cruiser Cherub off Val-
paraiso, and the Cherub came out on top.

“T. 0.1.” punctures some gory traditions:
Blood-and-thunder fiction dies hard on the Blue
Mountains, where the legend still flourishes that the
Govett, of Govett’s Leap, was a bushranger escaping
from police pursuit. As a matter of fact he was
one of Thos. Mitchell’s early surveyors; but most
ef the motor-men and vehicle-drivers stick to the
fiction as being more exhilarating. Again, King’s
Cave, at Linden, is described as the mountain
home of a bushranger named King, and close by
on the railway-line is a headstone to the memory
of Constable John Dunn, who, visitors are told, was
shot dead by King in 1838. There was no such
bushranger at that period ; Lieut. Cadell and 50 men
were then encamped here guarding a road-makiug-
gang of convicts. Again, Bull’s camp is frequently
referred to as the sometime station of the “most
cruel and bloody” commandant on the mountains
Actually, Capt. Bull, of the 99tli, was a most
humane man, who, after being commandant from
1842 to ’4B, became first gold-commissioner in
Victoria, and held office for years at Castlemaine.
He died at Goulburn in his 95th year.

“Moe’s” terra incognita :
There is scope for an aerial explorer in the great
Kunai Plateau, on the north-eastern side of New
Guinea. In one place, it extends for over 100 miles
without so much as a goat-path leading up to it
from the country below. Naturally, there are all
sorts of stories about the place, some holding that
it is inhabited by natives who have never descended
to the lower grounds, and that these natives are the
pigmy tribes whose existence has from time to time
been reported and scoffed at. It is certain that
natives do live on the top of the plateau, for from
points high up in the'surrounding country the smoke
of camp-fires has been seen, although long-range
telescopes have failed to pick out those who made
them. Some nine years ago, the Germans, then
owners of the territory, decided to attempt the
exploration of the plateau and the country on the
far side of it by means of an airship. But war
wrecked the scheme, and nothing in that direction
has since been attempted.
POUPETTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met Poupettc in a cabaret
When in Paris I chanced to be;
I caught the glint of those eyes of grey—
What havoc they worked on me!
She smiled at me through a veil of smoke,
A smile to lure a saint;
The dormant spirit within me woke
And I cast to the winds restraint.
Though her greeting was just a quiet “bon soir,”
Prom the lilt of the voice 1 knew
She wouldn’t be wishing me “au revoir”
Till the rest of my leave was through.
That furlough flew like a haunted ’plane
Through fleecy clouds of fun;
Then down to bloomin’ earth again,
And back to strafe the Hun.
“My big Australian, come again,’’
She said. We kissed good-bye.
I watched her from the moving train.
The glint had left her eye.
It’s five long years since I saw Poupette
Where are-lights gleam and glow—
It takes a bunch of cash to get
To there from Dorrigo.
Yet I sometimes dream about Poupettc,
Recalling her dainty charm.
It was quite all right for a maisonette —
But how would it go on a farm ?

F. M. Dickenson steps out of the Broken
Hill Brop.’s secretaryship. Assistant-sec.
Campbell being ill, Frank Mitchell goes into
Dickenson’s chair. Dickenson left the office
once before when (1. D. Meudell enticed him to
get busy on the Stock Exchange in the height
of the silver boom. As the atmosphere wasn’t
congenial, he didn’t refuse an inducement to
go back. He saw many big jobs through for
the Prop, in the old days of “the three D.’s”
Darling, Delprat and Dickenson. The first
is dead. No. 2 is out of the co., and now No. 3
has retired. Iron and steel finance and war
anxieties and post-war labor worries would
wear out stronger-framed men than Dicken-
son. Mitchell, who succeeds him, was Del-
prat’s secretary at Broken Hill. The change-
over to irdn-making brought him to Mel-
bourne. Tpence he went to Newcastle as
assistant-manager. Ilis smile, like Dicken-
son’s, is a possession ; and at dodging cor-
ners he can slip into his predecessor’s mantle
without leaving a wrinkle on it.
“Corn-Crake” : An amazing victory in the
English elections was that of Sidney Webb
Jor Seaham Harbor in Durham. He won
against a Conservative and a Liberal, with a
majority of 11,888 votes in a poll of 20,203
the biggest thing that ever happened to a
Labor candidate; and he had never contested
a seat before. He is 07, was one of the
founders of the
Fabian Society,
has an alarming
record for work,
and always calls
himself a Social-
ist. An authority
on social matters,
Webb will be able
to supply chapter
and verse to the
Labor party, which
will find out its
weaknesses in the
House very quickly.
It is a pity that
his age will pre-
vent his carrying
on the job of
Mentor to Labor
for very long. His
wife, by the way,
is the daughter of
a great railway
magnate.
H. L. COLLINS,
captain of the
N. S. Wales
Cricket XI.
As N.S.W. Director of Education, Peter
rfoard was right-hand man to seven Minis*
ters, and _all of them—James, Beebv,
U Gonor, Carmichael, Griffith, Mutch and
Bruntnell are still alive. The other day
they got together gnd presented Board with
an illuminated address—a unique memento
for him to take into retirement.
“Schnorrer”: Max Nordau, who died the
other day at 74, suffered curiously at the
hands of Fate. He was a Jew inclining
towards agnosticism when the promulgations
of Dr. Herzl, which started the Zionist move-
ment, awakened his enthusiasm for his own
race; and it was admitted by Herzl and
others that but for Nordau the movement
could never have won through. Yet at a
Zionist ball in Paris in 1903 a fanatical Yid
bred two shots at him, believing that his
willingness to accept East African land from
the British Government for a Jewish settle-
ment was an abandonment of the Palestine
objective. Again, though born in Budapest,
he lived from 1880 until 1914 in Paris, and
was considerably French in his outlook and
sympathies; yet when the war came he was
exiled (he went to Spain) and his property
was confiscated. He was practically starving
at the finish, in spite of being recognised as
one of the outstanding leaders and benefac-
tors of the world’s wealthiest race.
H Among the new members in the House of
Reps, about the youngest is F. M. Forde,
who bumped Higgs out of his Capricornia
seat. Though he has had a fair spell in
the Bananaland Parliament, Forde is still
in his twenties, and in appearance recalls
the juvenile Corboy, whose chorister-like
tones were heard in the Reps, when he fol-
lowed Bigjohn Forrest as member for Swan.
Another comparative youngster is Roland
Green, who scored the sensational victory
over Massy Greene. He is a slight, brown-
faced Anzac, with a good head, and it is
plain that, if his political qualifications
were small, his affable manner and lost leg
would win him hundreds of votes. But the
calibre of the man is shown in his regrets
that his war-loss gave him a sentimental
advantage over his opponent in an electorate
where regard for the Digger runs high.
Harry B. Friend, chief of Federal Han-
sard staff, is due for retirement about June,
and as his deputy, Lumsden, was farewelled
a few weeks back, Robinson and Admans,
who are apparently next in the line of suc-
cession, should enjoy unprecedented promo-
tions. Friend is the patriarch of Hansard
men. and is the founder of a system of re-
porting which has been largely imitated in
the British, Canadian and S’African Parlia-
ments. lie first practised shorthand in the
N.S.W. Parliament about 50 years ago, a”d
at the beginning of Federation the late Toby
Barton commissioned him to recruit a Han-
sard squad for the Commonwealth.
“Gallery” sounds a warning:—
Pressmen will have to be careful in dealing with
the new House of Reps. There are now a couple of
Camerons, Donald Charles and Malcolm Duncan, tlie
latter the successor to old John Livingston for Barker
(S.A.), and apparently they are two of a kind, like
Frederick Henry Francis, of Henty, and Josiah Ditto, of
Moreton (Q.). A pair of Rileys, the veteran Edward
and his son Edward Charles, will deliver duets in
the Labor caucus, where there will also be a McDon-
ald duo—ex-Speaker Charles and Frederick Albeit,
who wrested Barton from Hector Lamond. But
while Albert Ernest Green, of lvalgoorlie, will spruik
for the Bowyang party, Roland Frederick Herbert of the
same name, who defeated Massy Greene in Richmond
(N.S.W.), will say his little bit for Cocky. There
are further pitfalls in Maloney and Moloney, Mann
and Manning—the new members for Perth and
Macquarie (N.S.W.)—and Sydney Lane Gardner, the
choice of Robertson (N.S.W.), mustn’t be mistaken
for the ancient “Jupp.” Also, there are obvious
reasons why John Grant Duncan-Hughes, who outed
the ancient Story in Boothb.v (S.A.), must never
be published without his hyphen.
“Inanga”: Robert Stout, Chief Justice of
Maoriland, who has retired from the Chan-
cellorship of Wellington University, after
20 years’ service, has perhaps glimpsed the
shimmer of old Time’s scythe. Stout is a
Shetland Islander, who emigrated to M.L. in
his barefooted youth, studied, became first a
teacher and then a lawyer. He got into
Parliament; was a member of Hori Grey’s
one and only Ministry about 45 years ago ;
disappeared in the cyclone that struck the
Old Man ; came back in the Vogel revival of
1884, and emerged from the grand Ministry
m6l6e of that year—three Cabinets in about
as many weeks —as Premier, Vogel being
Treasurer, “with precedence.” Out again in
the second cyclone, about ’BB, and except for
another spasm in Parliament stayed out
until he was made C.J. Not a great lawyer,
but a slashing advocate and diabolical cross-
examiner.
John Hammer, of Adelaide, is inclined
to think his secretaryship of the East
End Market Co., held for 45 years, is an
Australian record. He has just given it up,
at close on 82, and his son Harry takes it
over.
‘Lexite”: An undoubted centenarian is
Airs. Agnes Mailler, of Waverlev (N.S.W.).
She is now in her 103rd year. It is 70
years since she arrived in N. S. Wales with
her husband, Capt. Robert Mailler, who ran
mails between Australia and Maoriland under
contract until his ship was wrecked.
Vic. provincial fire-fighters of to-day and
yesterday are mourning Joseph Nesbit
Stevens, sec. of the Country Board, who
passed out the other day. He had a long
innings as the Fitzgibbon of the Board, and
was more than half-way through the seven-
ties when he got the last call.
xr r?V>' : 9' Latham, recently elected
M.H.R. for Ivooyong (Vic.), in addition to
putting up a brilliant record at Melbourne
V arsity, in his younger days fought a great
fight against a distressing lingual malady;
and did it to such purpose that he can now
more than hold his own as a talker.
John Mackenzie, who went west in Wan-
gaehu (M.L.) recently, at 74, stepped
a | a ° re J?. orn * he 4« ra in Wellington in
185... With his family he crossed the Rimu-
takas to the Wairarapa, where he became a
big landowner. His specialties were light
horses and pure-bred Hereford cattle; but
he was one of the best all-round judges of
stock in the Dominion.
When the last N.S.W. State election left
Simon Hickey without a seat it did a good
turn to Australian industry. Hickey, who
while in Parliament ran a small manufac-
turing business, has now established, at Red-
fern, the Australian Silk Mills—the only silk
factory in the Southern Hemisphere; and he
is optimistic about making a very live thing
of it. Incidentally, the industry, when it
develops, will mean pocket-money for those
who make silk-worm culture a hobby.
Pea-Eye : “The Deacon” is wrong in
saying that a papal consistory “is held only
in donkey s years.” The old practice has passed
out, and to-day they meet any old time at
the Pope s wish. It was the intention of
the present occupant of “the Fisherman’s
throne to raise to the purple Mgr. Munde-
lem. Archbishop of Chicago, and-Mgr. Hayes.
Archbishop of New York, at the last con-
sistory, but their appointment was postponed
until the consistory, to be held next year
8o Archbish. Kelly still has a chance of get-
ting the pink hat and the cardinal’s rins at
an early date.
“Coot” : Travancore, Henry Madden’s resi-
dence at Flemington (Vic.), recently sold
to a golf club, was built by that remarkable
experimentalist, Hugh Glass, in the early
’sixties, it was then known as Flemington
House. Glass had water reticulated all over
the 100-odd acres, and experimented with
an amazing range of imported and indigenous
vegetables. He tried cotton, tea, coffee,
rice, guavas, bananas, pineapples, sugar-
cane and nardoo. He also imported camels
(later used by Howitt’s expedition that
sought for traces of Burke and Wills),
angora goats, deer,
mule s, ostriches
and 50 llamas from
Valparaiso (re-
leased in the
Dividing Range!'.,
Californian quail,
thrushes, black-
birds, pheasants,
guinea-fowl and
peacocks. The fine
aviary that housed
his songsters is
still in use at the
Melbourne Zoo.
He further special-
ised in imported
horses, sheep and
cattle, and was
also one of the
founders of the
fa m ous Tabilk
vineyard.
CHARLIE
WILSON, Parlia-
mentary Librarian,
Maoriland.
From Wm. McJaimet (Warracknabeal) :
Re the voyage of the death-ship Ticonderoga in
1852 (B. 11/l/’23). The writer of the par. says
there were 500 emigrants on board; but I have
records to show there were 811 passengers, and a
crew of very nearly 200, making about 1000 souls
all told. Besides those mentioned as survivors
there are Ewen Cameron, of Inverlochy, Balranald
(N.S.W.) and myself.
The scrapping of the old bell-punches used
by the conductors on the Melbourne trams
has brought to light the fact that for 38
years one woman has succeeded in keeping
a secret. The punches have been in use
since 1885, and during the whole period
Miss Purcell has been in charge of the
“punch" room. From time to time she has
altered the conbination controlling the open-
ing mechanism and revealed the new arrange-
ment to the other two in the secret —the
manager and a mechanic.
Theodore Fink, chairman of Melbourne
Herald, is going for a trip to the Cold Land
shortly. Guy Innes, who is to take charge
of the cabling at the London end. will, there-
fore, see something of him at the outset of
the fight with the evening Sun. Fink was
in the Vic. Assembly for 10 years (1894-
1904), and an Hon. Minister in the McLean
Cabinet for a fortnight in ’99. As chair-
man of an Education (University) Commis-
sion, the Assembly handed him a vote of
thanks at the bar of the House a little over
18 years ago.
Peter Molloy, recently dead in Adelaide
after an appendicitis operation, went into
the Black Watch as a boy in Scotland, and
served under Kitchener in the Soudan, and
Redvers Buller in S’Africa. When he
was all dressed up his chest was like a
second-hand ironmongery. But all his fight-
ing left him fit, and he came to the Broken
Hill mines in 1912. When the Big War
began he was 50, but he went into it with
four of his sons. He had dared Fate too
long, however, and on Gallipoli he got in-
juries w T hich ultimately cost him both legs
and one arm.
“J.H.” (London) : An Australian who has
made good in spite of the Harley-street. haut
monde, which frowns on intruders from over-
seas t with new theories about tuberculosis,
is W. Camac Wilkinson, M.D., formerly lec-
turer at Sydney ’Varsity and a keen mem-
ber of the old Zingari Cricket Club. He
has his headquarters in fashionable Upper
Wimpole-street, and is a big man on “T. 8.”
and its allied diseases. Wilkinson often
writes pithy articles for the Evening
Standard, and, like most Australians who
have made good in the Big Smoke, is always
ready to lend a helping hand to fellow-
countrymen pushing a pen here for their
living. Prof. Grafton Elliott Smith and
Prof. Gilbert-Murray are two others equally
considerate and accessible. Wilkinson is a
sworn foe of the Spahlinger treatment, and
is now writing a weighty tome in assault of
it.
“Graeme”: Parson Fox, of Manly, near
Brisbane, has six sons and two daughters,
all of whom have taken degrees in medicine
at Edinburgh ’Varsity. R. B. Walker, an
Anglican shepherd now rat Bundaberg, has
seven sons, every one of whom is an M.A.
of Oxford.
A BALLAD OF POSSIBLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Liberal Union, while warmly approving Mr.
Hughes’s removal, is by no means enamored of Mr.
Bruce.”— Age.
“If the Nationalists consider Mr. Page unaccept-
able, there may be a move in favor of Mr. Pratten.”
■—Sydney Telegraph.
“Mr. Watt is still a possibility.” —Any paper.
Though done is the Billywog’s dash,
It wouldn’t be safe to deduce
That those who have settled his hash
Are ardent admirers of Bruce.
The prophets are daily diffuse
And wordy in airing their views;
But, oh! ’tis a question abstruse:
For whom is the mantle of Hughes?
What name shall be next in the book
Of Barton and Deakin and Reid,
And Watson and Fisher and Cook,
And, longest of all in the lead,
The seventh, whose doom was decreed
When, pet of the gents who refuse
Their names, he was five-figure-fee'd ?
But who’s the successor of Hughes?
There's Bruce; he's an echo, no more,
Of the joss to be jettisoned. Page?
Is he skilled in political lore
Or in counsel sufficiently sage
For the taste of the Argus and Age,
The Herald, the Sun or the News?
Could be stand unperturbed on the stage
In the limelight that beat upon Hughes ?
What of Pratten ? He’s shrewd and has weight,
Some argue, and tactical skill.
No telling he mightn’t be 8
On the role of P.M.’s if he will.
It isn’t a pound to a pill
That the hat and the cloak and the shoes
lie couldn’t efficiently fill
When they’re dragged from the carcase of Hughes.
There’s a horse that no watchers remark
On the tracks where competitors trot,
He is most unmistakably dark
And the chance that the animal’s got
Is a difficult thing to allot
In the absence of definite clues,
But you might have a ticket on Watt
In the race for succession to Hughes.
Envoy,
There’s Treasurer Bruce or there’s Page,
There’s Watt or there’s Pratten to choose,
Where pundits and punters engage
In picking the sequel to Hughes.

“Bouragi”: “Dia Qara” (B. 11/l/’23),
in discussing- the Papuan collectors of skulls, doesn’t
mention the methods of the Binandele and other
tribes between the N.E. coast and the headwaters of
the Kumusi and Mamba rivers. These connoisseurs,
having picked the skulls white, used to hang them
in the dead branches of a tree, specially ring-
barked for the purpose, in the middle of their
villages. Through the branches and among the
skulls were thrust the long poles on which the
dead and living captives were carried back to the
raiders’ villages. These people were a sociable and
domestic folk, and loved to eat their meals in the
bosom of the family, so to speak. For this reason
they preferred to capture prisoners alive, or partly
so. It distance and weather permitted, they also

ing-weather the corpses were cut up and eaten, <r
taken home in neat little cooked joints, wrapped in
banana-leaf and tied with fibre. Many an old
Yodda hand will remember the trees with the skulls
and the dozens of bristling poles in the upper
Ivumusi villages. Those poles, with their blood-
stained bark and the half-untied bonds still cling-
ing to them, always seemed to mo more sinister
than the skulls.

"Golub”: White-bellied snakes are com-
paratively common, there being a whole variety of
the bla<k snake (Pseudechis porphy'riacvs) with the
bleached tummy, though the white is only a strip
along the belly itself, and cannot usually be seen
from above. But some months ago a black snake,
killed on the banks of Nerang Creek, near South-
port (Q.), had the white extending from the belly
up both sides to a point which left the edges cf
the coloration separated by 6nly about an inch
or so. The effect was that of a white snake with
a black strip down its back from nose to tail :
but there was no doubt that the specimen did belong
to the classification P. porphyriacus.
"Sir Spoil” : Scott turned up at Hudson’s
place the other day and found the old man sitting
on a log down by the cultivation paddock. With
his head in his hands he was gazing fixedly at tue
ground and muttering, "I’ll learn ’im, the blasted
cow —yes, I’ll learn ’im.” It looked like another
row between old Hudson and Fuller, who lived cn
the opposite side of the creek, but Scott didn’t in-
quire. “Very hot to-day,” he remarked. Hudson
slowly raised his glance. “Yes —and serve ’im
dam’ well right if it was twice as ’ot. I’ll learn
'im!” “Oh, get out,” said Scott, cheerily. “I didn’t
come to hear your troubles; I came to see if I
could borrow your bull.” “My bull, is it? Well,
’e’s in the pound,” grunted the old man. “Some
more of Fuller’s dirty work?” ventured Scott. “Naw.
I did it: tneself.” “Good Lord! What for?” “What
for! Why, the baldy-faced blank gets into the
paddick this mornin’ an’ ’elps ’isself ter my corn!”

“Mulligan”: My experience, gained in the
far-west and nor’-west of Queensland, has taught
me that cattle will not camp contentedly on a hard
or stony camp, no matter how tired they may be
(“Gilgi,” B. 4/l/’23). In the first place, cattle,
when walking on hard, level ground, make a very
loud rattle with their cloven hoofs, and those that
may be disposed to sleep, on hearing this rattle, are
at once up and doing. In the second place—well,
the drover who can talk a mob of cattle into oamp
itig contentedly on stones must be on very good
terms with his mob. I’ve always picked a soft .and
uneven camp when possible, because when a bullock
gets up and has a walk about on a soft camp lie
doesn’t disturb his mates, and if none follows him
lie goes back to bunk, conforming to the will 0 ;
the majority. But there’s a vast difference between
a mob of mixed cattle mustered and camped on
the station for the first night, and a mob of (all)
bullocks that has been on the road for some time.
In the case of the former, mothers are searching for
their offspring, Jocks for their Jills, and sundry
other cobbers that they have been parted from, perhaps
for the first time in their lives—with the result that
every experienced stockman expects and seeks to
meet with a double or treble watch. In the case
of an all-bullock mob well on the road, I have
seen 808 of ’em that had had sufficient food and
water during the day string on to oamp and lie
down within their accustomed distance of the
camp-fire without any help from the drovers. As
for lighted lanterns encircling the camp, no one
but a Pitt-street pen-drover would mention such a
ridiculous thing in connection with Western Queens-
land cattle. Anyhow, how are you going to trans-
port the lanterns, fuel and poles, seeing that in this
region carts are never used with travelling stock?
* * * *
“Te Wliare”: The curious musk-duck
(Biziura lobata) lays only two eggs, while others
of the tribe lay from 8 to 10 in a clutch, or even
more. This peculiarity, of course,
accounts for the comparative scarcity
of the musk-duck. The last pair of
eggs I saw were taken long ago from
a South Coast (N.S.W.) lagoon. They
were very large compared with those
of the black-duck,, teal, etc., and very
rounded in shape. The musk-duck
was once fairly common in that
quarter, but it is how scarce. Some
years ago I saw four couples on a
large reedy swamp near Tilba, and
there used to be odd pairs on secluded
waterhol.es far up the Bombala River.
A good observer says that the musk-
duck, when its lagoon or lake, or
whatever its watery home may be,
is beginning to dry up, starves itself
down to a light weight so that it
can. take the air with its rudimentary
pinions. He says the little grebe (or
diver ), rarely seen on the wing,
does ditto. However, I think both
musk-duck and grebe, though unwill-
ing aviators, are capable of shifting
whenever they like without taking a
course of antifat. I’ve seen over 40
gun-scared grebe shift hurriedly from
a lake to a river about two miles
away. They didn’t wait to grow
poor. Also, when a big isolated sur-
face pool was left by a flood in this
(South Coast, N.S.W.) district, it is
remarkable with what,celerity a couple
of score of little grebe appeared on
it. And they hadn’t walked there.
Yerae : ‘Pinnacle’s” unconscious drover
(B 21/12/’22) reminds me of the case of George
SSv rof m n r ' getter at Peterson ’ s “wrnm, Kil
larnej (Q,). One .morning, in 1911, a falling tree
stnick another, and a limb broke off and hit him.

could not speak, and died four days afterwards
without having uttered a word!

"J.L.T.” : Re “S.S.” (B. 28/12/’22) on
children and snakes. When my uncle was a chile
of five he used to take his bowl of bread-and-milk
out into the yard, and consume it upon a wood-pile.
When asked what the attraction of the wood-r.de
was he replied: “My pussy lives down there, and
every tunc I take a spoonful of bread and milk I give
pussy one.” As there were several cats about the
place not much notice was takeu of the remark
Then, one day, when the toddler and his mother
were in the dairy, a couple of small snakes
across the floor, much to the delight of the youngster,
SO WHAT COULD WE DO WITH FATHER ?

SECOND DITTO: "Well, it'd be 'ardly fair on the old man . 'E's sixty-nine, and the wool-
shed leaks.”
who cried: “Look at the little pussies.” That gave
the show away, and when the man of the house
returned he scattered the woodheap, and under
it found a black snake nearly 6ft. long and of
unusual girth. It was promptly killed amid the
tearful protestations of the little lad who had for
so long shared his bread and milk with it.
•** * *
“Jimmy Possum” : Such incidents as that
told by “Big Spider” (B. 30/11/’22), about a
native-bear getting on its feet and starting for a
gum-tiee when it was half skinned, are, unfortu-
nately, only too common when prices fir pelts are
high and there is much competition among skin-
collectors. In years gone by I had frequently to
remonstrate with thoughtless whirlwind scalpers,
whose habit it was to drag the pelt off shot native-
bears before they had ceased to breathe. I know
of one case in which some youths, after shooting
and skinning a bear, threw the body against the foot
of a tree. Returning about an hour later, they
were horrified at seeing the unfortunate creature—
which had been shot through the head—sitting up
and feebly attempting to climb the tree. They
were humane enough hurriedly to knock the poor
devil on the head, and make sure of its despatch
by throwing its battered and bleeding body into a
tidal creek nearby.
* * * •
Parawa”: “Allbut’s” small shrub (B.
■l/l/’23) with the curative sap, about Wyong and
Gosford (N.S.W.), seems to have a first cousin up in
the western division of New Guinea. There the
weed is a trifle more hefty, averaging something
like 10ft. in height; but the leaves are green all
right, the blossoms are a dull red, and the sap
in the stem is thick, white and milky, and possesses
similar curative properties. The * New Guinea
natives keep a supply and use it as an ointment for
spreading over pimples, rashes and other skin-
troubles, and at times cover the mess with a wad
of crushed leaves of the same vegetable. I don’t
know the name of the shrub—the natives call it
something that sounds like “kududugege”—but if
“Allbut” gives particulars re shape of leaf and the
class of seed, some one of the Council might be
able to put us wise.
* * ■* •
‘Roback” : The native of mandated New
Guinea is a simple soul, and always ready to fall in
with the wishes of his native master. On our
plantation the boss admonished a youngster for his
seeming neglect of a brood of ducklings in his
charge, and explained that, for their age, they
should be much bigger. Next day when making a
tour of the farm-yard the planter discovered several
of the ducklets with their little toes pointing sky-
ward. Inquiring into their demise he was informed
by the diminutive coon: “Before,' alle time me givim
this fella pato [duck] plenty kai-kai; he no savee
big fella quick. Me like he big fella quick. Now
me eatehim pump belong wheelwheel [bicycle] •
now me pumpim strong fella too much— now hr

“Rhino”: If “Kas Kas” (B. 2/11/’22)
wants to keep bis dogs to himself I would advise
him to see that the Kanakas never get a chance to
handle them. There is a reason why a dog handled
by Kanakas will leave a white man, but “K.K.” will
need, to go to one of the old hands in the islands
to be told about it. Personally I never allow a
Kanaka to have anything to do with my dogs—
to either handle or feed them. Once you let the
niggers have anything to do with them, the do-s
are of very little use to you afterwards.
“Ragar”: The recent lightning-stroke in
loowoomba (Q r ), which is said to have boiled the
water in a 2000-gallon tank, must have been an
old-inaa flash—if there was much water there
at the time. Two thousand gallons take a lot of
boiling. Lightning seems to be attracted in some
way by water tanks, especially when elevated on
high supports. I had the sheet-iron top of a
similar-sized tank ripped in halves, and the tank
slewed half round at the same time by a flash. The
tank was only about one-third full at the hue, but
it didn’t boil, as far as 1 could see. bp north,
awhile ago, a newly-erected tank, standing on four
10ft. posts, was half filled by a slight fall of rain
on the Monday, and emptied the next day through
lightning knocking the bottom out of it. As all
the water went to waste while we were sheltering
in the house, I’m unable to say whether that boiled
either.
* * * *
“Lytron”: An incident at Lake Hind-
marsh (Vic.) the other day emphasised how typical is
Percy Leason’s art. Mr. Cocky had spotted a
hive of bees in the topmost limb of a tree on
the banks of the lake. Although the tree wasn’t
of great height, the trunk afforded no foothold, so
the bewhiskered one (escorted by his family and
a neighbor) brought a rope and threw it over
the limb. Settled in a loop in one end, and
armed with an axe, he got the family to haul
him up. They pulled with a will, and he was
gradually drawn higher and higher, until the dis-
tance between himself and the ground became dis-
turbing. Then came a swaying of the rope and he
dropped the hatchet. “Look out—the axe!” he

yelled. Those below didn’t need a second warning:
consequently the axe struck mother earth exactly
two seconds before Ziff did. To mention bees
in that locality now T would be just committing
suicide.

“FY7”: I’m inclined to agree with
“Gazeeka” (B. 11/l/’23) that the bronzewing
pigeon (scrub, not crested) is the fastest flier
of all. If there is a speedier, I would tip the
beautiful little pigmy-goose, which, after being
missed down the line, goes past the next gun with
the throttle full open. As to the pace of
kangaroos, also referred to by “Gazeeka,” I have
never seen a really big old-man who could extend
a moderately fast dog. The red-kangaroo doe —
she is usually blue, by-the-way—is, on the other
hand, esteemed the fastest thing going among
Westerners who keep a kangaroo-dog or two.
* if * #
“Simon II.”: “Ur. Nil” (B. 11/l/’23)
mentions Physignathus lesuerii- —known to common
blokes like myself as the water-lizard. This reptile
is the friendliest of his tribe. I went a-fishing r.n
the Gwydir (N.S.W.) recently, and, having tossed the
lines in, I was settling myself comfortably, when, on
glancing at the water, I found that both scarlet-
painted floats had vanished. I hauled excitedly at
first one line, then the other, but only gathered in
a lot of slack. It was then I saw my floats well
ashore, with two small lizards making gallant efforts
to bring them still further inland. I tossed the
lines out afresh, but the moment the floats hit
the water the lizards swam out and brought them
ashore again. After this performance had been
repeated a couple of times, I took the floats off,
whereat the little retrievers looked very unhappy,
and took up a position of expectancy a cduple of
feet away until lunch-time. 1 gave them a piece
of bread each, which they ate eagerly enough, then
some scraps of corned-beef, and finally some cake.
We were getting quite well acquainted, when Ma
Lizard arrived. She was a bit suspicious, but
several varieties of food were accepted and we
became friends, and she spent the rest of the after-
noon with us. Ma taped about 2ft. 6in., and the
youngsters about Bin. I couldn’t find one of the
floats when I left, so 1 presume the nippers took
it as a souvenir.
HE WANTED THE SINK.
WOOP WOOP (staying in city hotel for the first time): “Say,
young feller, where’s the kitchen?”
ASTONISHED WAITER : “What do you want the kitchen for?”
Woop Woop : “Want ter wash meself, o’ course.”
“Machete”: “V.C.’s” advice to “Jimmy
Trousers” (B. 4/l/’23), to use wood-ashes as a
substitute for soap, has the imprimatur of history.
As far as can be gathered, soap is only about 500
years old and is said to have been invented by
Italians, a people who have grown to hate it. The
ancient civilisations used oils for cleansing their
bodies, and for washing clothes used “lye” made
from soaking wood-ashes in water. To this was
often added an ammoniacal liquid which is not,
nowadays, held in high estimation. In the Middle
Ages it was carefully conserved in special vessels,
and in these all clothing to be washed was steeped
before going to the “lye.” Whenever I read of the
Middle Ages, the Courts of Love, the jongleurs and
the jousts my mind always trips over those medi-
eval slop pails.

“Murkah” : I don’t see any trace of mental
heredity in the fact that a sheep-pup chased fowls.
If sheep-pups learnt their biz as easily as “Picko”
(B. 4/l/’23) alleges, there would be no reason for
the laborious training that goes on. And well-trained
pups wouldn’t fetch such fancy prices. It is a
notorious fact that sheep-pups, however well-bred,
removed from sheep environment in their early
stages cannot afterwards be trained. Environment
is everything. How could it be otherwise? Put
the best-bred sheep-pup in the land in a rabbit
pack, and what happens? He chases rabbits —a thing
a properly-brought-up pup wouldn’t dream of doing.
* * * #
“Wild Oat”: The beetles complained of
by “Double Disc” (B. 11/l/’23) are one of the free
gifts donated by Dame Nature every Christmas. And
anyone in possession of a pepper-tree will have more
than his share of the pests. A good way to get
rid of them is to build a fowl-run beneath the tree,
and every morn at daybreak shake the branches
vigorously. The hens will do the rest. A light
over water at night will also entice them to their
doom.
* * * *
“F. Clinton”: We were surveying a big
block in rough country, and one corner was located
high up a steep ridge that was terraced with low cliffs.
A hard-bitten old chap started out to stidk a peg
in this corner. The last hundred feet or so was
a deuce of a climb, but steadily and laboriously
he crawled and clambered up with the peg, stopping
now and again to take breath and swear. He had
arrived at a point about 30ft. from the corner
when both strength and patience petered out. Clutch-
ing a tuft of grass with his left hand to steady
himself, he raised the peg in his right hand, and,
without troubling to take aim, hurled it in the
direction of the corner. “Blast you, stop there,”
he roared; “I’m damned sure I can’t reach you,
and I’ll take mv blankv oath nobodv else ever
will!”
* * * *
“Jobber” : Among the sugar-cane in North
Queensland there grows a 3mall shrub known as “Cydra-
cusia” (I don’t know if that’s the botanical name,
or a local one; nor whether the spelling is right.)
We could always tell, by watching this plant, when
it was mid-day, for as sure as 12 o’clock came round
the petals would slowly open, and they would go to
by-by again at sunset. What do the learned coun-
cillors know about it?

“R la ino” : Re
swamp cancer i n
horses (B. 19/10/’22).
The disease is very
prevalent here in the
Solomon Islands; many
horses on Guadalcanar
Island contract it if
they are allowed to
run in the ivory-nut
swamps at all. But
I don’t think with
“Borom” that a leech
is the carrier, as I’ve
never seen one in these
swamps. As to treat-
ment, this has proved
very successful: When
the disease first shows,
clip the hair from
round the ulcer and
wash well with a 5
per cent, solution of
carbolic acid, then ap-
ply an ointment of
loz. lead acetate, foz.
zinc sulphate, and
loz. copper sulphate
mixed to a paste with
pure water. (I have
used a paste of Bor-
deaux mixture and
water when I have not
had the other stuff on
hand, and it has turned
out well.) I also give
a drench made up of
1$ drams iodide of
potassium in one pint
of wa t e er. This
should be given daily
till iodism sets in,
after which the drench
should be discontinued
for about 10 days, and
then given again, if
necessary. The horse
should, of course, be
kept away from the
swamp while this treat-
ment is being given,
and afterwards, too, if possible.

V ery H 'L' a tSftal
to a mere mudpool, a number of small black-bream
vvere taken from it- They had> rio doubt> been left
there by a big flood of a year ago. Although sea-
mullet and estuary perch (Australian bass) grow
to full size and wax fat in lagoons and ponds near
coastal rivers, I had not previously been aware
that black-bream could exist for long in fresh water.
Another fish which homes healthily in such stagnant
waters is the spiky and poisonous bullrout, first
cousin of the dangerous fortescue. Flathead, how-
ever, soon turn white bellies skyward when the water
becomes merely brackish.
THE DIPLOMAT.
THE UNBELIEVER: “What do you do with all the fish you catch?”
THE FISH LIAR: “Take ’em home. But don't mention them big
ones I’ve been telling you about to the wife, or she’ll think
I’m keeping another cat.”
“Roback” (Papua) : The native never
uses the word “broke” in his pidgin English. It’s
always the Australian expression “blankied-up.”
This is apt to be embarrassing to the newly-arrived
woman from south. For months before my wife
came up I schooled my houseboy to substitute
“broke” for the other. All went well for a week
after her arrival; then one night the newly-wed wife
of the missionary was my guest. About half-way
through dinner there was a terrific crash in the cook
house, and immediately a very frightened Papuan
appeared in the doorway with “Taubada, altogether
plate belong soup he blankied-up!” “What!” I
admonished. “Altogether plate belong soup he
blankied-up.” Whereat I roared “What!” Then
light dawmed in his quaking brain. “Aw Orise,”
he groaned, “me forget, he no blankied-up—he
broke.”
* * # *
“Merrigal”: Gatke, a pioneer in the study
of bird migration, believed that the little Arctic
blue-throat ( Cyanecula suecica ) could leave Africa
at dusk and land at 1800-miles-distant Heligoland
nine hours later. He also calculated that curlew’s,
godwits and plovers crossed from that island to
the oyster-beds four miles to the east in one minute.
A carrier-pigeon has been timed to fly at 55 miles
an hour for four consecutive hours, while it is
recorded in the “Homing Fanciers’ Annual” (1892)
that one had flitted 82 miles at the rate of VI
miles an hour. Yet another one is credited with
having flown from the Seilly Isles to its box in
Wiltshire, a matter of 215 miles, in a dot over
four hours. A pheasant has been clocked to do 57,
a duck 47, a starling 45 and a skylark 25 miles an
hour. A swallow, taken from Roubaix to Paris (160
miles) and liberated, made its home loft in 90
minutes. Incidentally, a swift is speedier than a
swallow; and —this is the point for “Gazeeka”
iB. 11/l/’23) —according to birdologists, wild pigeons
probably don’t fly any faster than domesticated ones.
* * # »
“C 2” (M.L.) : Re “Centre’s” vegetable
shikker (B. 21/12/’22). The Old Whiskers he mentions
is probably a Russian. In Siberia, a similar species
of fungus ( Amanita muscaria ) is used either for a
mild jag or to get a bend on for a week. Used in
soups, etc., it acts as a gentle reviver; but to get
more action the tippler rolls his dose and swallows
it whole. If chewed, it is said to disorder the
stomach. One or two small fungi give a rosy
view for a whole day. The effect, which is increased
if water be taken shortly afterwards, comes on in
the course of an hour or two. The Siberian brand
of solid lightning produces wrong impressions as
to size and distance, and makes a small stick look
as large as a trunk of a large tree. But tell
“Centre” to go carefully in N. S. Wales, as most
dead-timber fungi there have a very deadly kick.
Incidentally, I’m wondering now if the fungus here
in Maoriland which is bought up by the Chinese
has a mild shikker in it.
“Simon II.” : “Zanthus” (B. 11/l/’23)
asks is there any evidence that our coastal abos. were
ever cannibals? Well, they were —but not usually
from choice, except in N.Q., when a stray Chinaman
could be bagged. The northern abo., coastal or
inland, considered a
Chinaman very t good
kai-kai. When I was a
youngster in the Wide
Bay district, 40 years
ago the coastal tribe
(Noosa), whose diet
consisted mainly of
fish, had an agreement
with the Wide Bay
tribe IBoonara) to tra-
verse the latter’s terri-
tory in order to reach
the bunya scrubs on
the Black Snake range
to get a feast of the
bunya nut. This feast-
time usually lasted
about three weeks,
after which the lean,
fish-fed coasters would
return very pot-bellied
and exuding oil at
every pore. For tra-
versing the Boonara
territory the Noosas
had to pay a tribute
in the way of shell
ornaments and weapons,
and it was laid down
that they should not
kill any game as they
went. As the coast
blacks moved en masse,
taking every last aged,
sick and helpless picca-
ninny with them, their
progress was slow and
provisioning was a ser-
ious matter, especially
as the Boonaras enforced
their game laws by
flanking the visitors
with troops of fighting
men. So, before leav-
ing their stamping
ground, the elders of
the Noosa tribe would
select certain members
of their flock to be
killed and eaten in
order to avoid famine
en route. Their choice
was usually confined to women and female
children. Many, grim episodes resulted from this
law' —which was one of necessity—but I never heard
that they practised cannibalism from choice.

Some domesticated brolgas :—•
“Valomae”: Tell “Malokihi” (B. 4/l/’23), who
wants to hear of a pet native-companion, that the
McPaul family, Pittsworth (Q.), had a tame one
for years, and although it sometimes spent the
daytime in the company of other brolgas it in-
variably returned home at night. It eventually
stopped ■ a charge of shot from the gun of a
neighboring cocky, who found it helping itself to
his corn-crop.
“Madk”: In Narrandera (N. 9.W.), about 25
years ago, a native-companion used to follow a
wooden-legged man to work every day. It was in
an argument with a couple of greyhound-dogs
that he passed out.
“Trevdee”: A northern Victorian for years had
two brolgas stalking about the house, and they’d
follow him like dogs. A snake killed one, and
only a few’ months back the other died of old age—•
he was close on 30. People miss the latter fellow,
GUILEFUL CHARLIE.
STATION HAND (sampling newchum): “ ’N’
did they duck you when you crossed the
line?”
NEWCHUM : “Oh, we didn't cwoss the
Equator — we — ah—in fact —I took a
boat that went the othah way wound!”
for, whenever a change in the weather was approath-
ingj he always warned them with a series of loud
shrieks.
“M. Magee”: The only pet native-companion I
ever saw was at the shearers’ quarters, Coongoola
station, Cunnamulla (Q.), about 10 years ago. It
was very pugnacious and easily held its own among
the dogs and cats; also it was a decided menace to
any children who ventured within 50 yards of it.
MOUNTAIN BUSUFIRES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now like a giant blister of dark blood
The summer sun floats in a smoky sky.
Brown leaves across the ashy valleys scud,
And not a vagrant bird is left to crj-.
Hell festers far down there —a solemn sight
For eyes red-rimmed and sleepless from the strain
Of watching for the spark that vet may light
The little homestead with a flame’s red stain.
Sinister troops parade the dewless west,
Wraiths, demon-fanged and companies of ill.
And, as the sick, hot day departs for rest,
Night waves her dreadful torch on every hill.

The weather for the second day of the
Anniversary A.J.C. meeting was a Scotch
haggis of cloud and sun, with a leak threat-
ening every moment. A stiff, cold breeze
blew unceasingly across the stands, but the
betting-ring, where the children of the
Chosen stood about naively introducing
themselves by their first names to the
stranger, was peaceful and sunny, so that
the fur-coat or heavy tailorings that meant
comfort while the race was on became un-
bearably stuffy Avhile the lady inside stood
watching the numbers go up. The meet-
ing was not an upper-crust mannequin
parade, although a lot of society swish
tucked itself within the Official Stand. Coats
and skirts swing back into their own ; some
in heather mixture and Harris tweed were
of the strictly Nonconformist cut beloved
of Maoriland and the shooting-boxes of
Scotland (the last according to the English
illustrated^), but most of them conveyed a
hint of frivolity in Oriental embroideries or
shiny nail-heads, or braidings carried out
in complicated designs calculated to send
anyone with a temperature into a wild de-
lirium.
The vice-regals gave the glad eye from
the official pew; her Ex. in navy with
beaver accessories and a close-fitting flower
turban. Navy blue also enfolded Mrs. Swin-
son and Mrs. Hugh Denison, who were of
the Government House party. Mrs. Ernest
Watt’s tweed suit opened coyly over a
canary-colored waistcoat, and the Lough-
borough lady upheld the peerage in a black-
and-white tailored outfit topped by a close-
fitting black hat that wore a gardenia in
its ear. Rita Buckland moored her Kitty
Bellairs chin by the inevitable strap, and
was clothed otherwise in flimsy blue and
furs. Her willow-pattern sister, Mrs. Clay-
ton, was in some slim widths of Avindow-
curtain material, golden in tone; she was
high as to collar and very long as to ear-
rings. Mrs. Tony Hordern’s handsome ta lor-
ings were colorful with embroideries. Mrs.
Norman Pilcher covered apricot georgettes
with a musquash coat. Mrs. Magney brought
daughter Linda in rose-pinlc velour, and Mrs.
Langton picked out mastic charmeuse with
tufts of green as emerald as the rain-
drenched grass on the lawn ; the Knox lady
faced the weather in sapphire-toned maro-
cain, and Mrs. Colin Stephen chose the
safety of navy-blue plumage. An honorable
mention might be gi\ r en to the lawms —they
looked radiant after the’ir drunken night.
And no doubt if the poetic punter had time
to tune her ear she’d have heard a lark sing-
ing in the blue; but competition was so
keen the poor thing had all she could do to
save herself a feather to fly home with.
Earl Ducie, known to Bananalanders as
B. P. Moreton, M.L.C., has found the
rigors of London’s winter too much for his
Australian blood. Tired of being anchored
to a roaring fire almost ever since he opened
the front door of Talworth Castle and
pushed his carpet-bags under the family
bed, he and his daughter, Lady Beatrice
Moreton, are taking an early boat back to
Australia. Lord Moreton, his eldest son,
will be “overseer” of things during the
Earl’s absence, which is likely to be for the
term of his natural life.— —'
Commodore Melvor Edwards and his
pretty wife are openly bewailing the lot
r that takes them from Australia. They love
our way of life and the long months of
sunshine ; and, most of all, they love Austra-
lia for making their rather delicate boy so
healthy and brown. He’s taller than his
mother now, and can swim and ride like a
real Aussie fellow. Mrs. Edwards gives her
final party to the Sailors’ Wives and Mothers
at Tresco on the seventh.
From Washington, U.S.A., comes news of
the marriage of Marcus B. Matson to Car-
men Jerome, daughter of Bulletin irerse-
writer Helen Jerome. Helen, who has been
among the Stars and Stripes for a year or
so, recently received some flattering publicity
as a song-writer.
Marjorie Pain (whose father was Dr.
Maynard Pain, of Sydney and Cairo) and
Charles Noel Young, of Bundaberg (Q.)
chose the picturesque Church of St. John’s
Darlinghurst, for the scene of their knot-
tying last week. Padre Kenneth Pain, the
bride’s uncle, made Marjorie and her young
man husband and wife, and was given due
assistance in a fully choral service. The
bride wore ivory satin and Brussels lace;
five young things, symphonies in pale blue
and white, attended the bridal draperies;
and the bridegroom staggered through with
three (only) supports. Mother spread the
Avedding feast at the Waratah.
_ St. Philip’s, on Church Hill, lit up one
night last week for the marriage of Colleen
Taylor, one-time of Queensland, but now at
Elizabeth Bay, to Lieut. “Evie” Lascelles,
R.F.C., of Proserpine (Q.). Canon Belling-
ham was 0.C., and the dark-haired bride,
who wore a frock of ivory morocain with
georgette side-trimmings, was followed by
sister Edna in a soft-pink satin outfit.
Bride’s mother subsequently dispensed wed-
ding food and jazz at the Wentworth.
The Dame Margaret Appeal for the Raw-
son Institute had, up to tne end of last year,
realised over four thousand pounds. With
the exception of some small cheques, £l5O
from M_rs. Hugh Denison and the Orient S.S.
Co.’s £5OO, the total was really netted in a
few months from entertainments ; so the sec-
retaries and organisers should feel a right-
eous glow,. and can truly take to themselves
the flattering words spoken at Government
House last week.
St. Vincent’s nightingales gave their
yearly at-home one night last week, and
the top end of Victoria-street was thick with
cars, ancient and modern, for the meds. of
Sydney turn up in force to this flutter. For
its ninth birthday the party had hung out a
special line of electrics and Chinese lan-
terns, and the effect was particularly cheery
in the quadrangle of the Nurses’ Home,
where the songandance was held. The doc-
tors’ ballet, led by Mrs. Furlong (she was
Sister Alice McElhone), ought to be engaged
by the Firm to brighten up one of its pan-
tomimes. The classic outline of some of
those young medicine-men would make the
Eve. Greys or the Margaret Leahys put in
a bit of overtime to keep their places in the
Venus de Milo class.
The surfing girl left the Bondi tram at
the top of Darlinghurst. Opposite St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital she saw a fruit-hawker and
a cartload of peaches. Stepping over the
mermaid requested a dozen ; “Your very best,
for a sick friend.” The old man dropped'
the fruit with sympathetic interest into the
paper-bag. “An’ tell me now, Miss, is it in
hospital your friend is?” “She is, poor
soul,” murmured the girl. “Mebbe, now,
it’s in this very St. Vincent’s she’s lying?”
“Yes,” nodded the girl. “Well, well. An’
tell me, now. is it serious sick she is?” “Yes,
indeed,” said the mermaid, driven from one
lie to another. The old man pocketed the
2s. slowly, and still more sloAvly looked for
the 6d. change, shaking his head sorroAV-
fully. “ ’Tis a hard world, Miss, an’ the
suffering in it beyond belief. Would you
credit it, now, that you’re the twelfth cus-
tomer I’ve had this very morning buying
peaches for a friend that’s lying close to
death in that very St. Vincent’s opposite?”
The mermaid said she was in a hurry, and
he needn’t bother about the change.
The usual plutocratic upholstery of
Anthony Horderns’ Art Gallery has given
place the last week
to islands of cane
chairs, with an
occasional oasis of
grass mats. This is
t o surround the
Ellis Silas show
with the correct
atmosphere of tro-
pic freedom from
the conventions.
Ellis Silas, who has
been up among the
coral reefs—h i s
headquarters were
the Trobriand
Islands dropped
into Sydney a week
or so ago with a
cargo of trop'c
color, dazzling opal-
escent seas, slender
palms quivering with sunlit winds, and
a coppery belle or two to supply human
interest. He really meant to take the whole
kit on to England, but was persuaded to
unveil them in the big Ilaymarket gallery.
That many of these highly-keyed riots of
color will never leave Australia is our gain.
Ellis is a slim, dark young man, an ex-
warrior and a jazz glutton.
The Playhouse in Castlereagli-street will
no longer harbor the Repertory produc-
tions. The Conservatorium is booked for
the society’s next show, and this should
give the Repertorians (has a fossilised
sound, somehow) a chance to spread in the
matter of membership, as the Con. holds
twice as many as the Lit-tle Theatre. One
trouble is going to be the extra labor attached
to dismantling the sets at the end of each
play, and remaking the first set just before
each performance, as the rules of the Con.
require. But the special Marcel over the
Society’s high brow is its new club in Bligli-
street. near the Royal Colonial Institute.
The old Elizabeth-street place was right in
the Friday-night shopping centre, just down
from Liverpool-street.
Miss J* M. Jopling, of Sydney Public
Library and vice-president of the women’s
section of the Public Service Association,
has flitted off on a year’s tour of the United
States, where she intends studying library
work. A presentation travelling-cushion
will soften the rigors of her trip.
Lute Drummond goes off by the Orsova
with two pretty flapper nieces in tow—Fay
and Ruth Ainsworth. Mrs. George Taylor
gives them a send-off party on the seventh,
and for the past fortnight the three have
been bombarded with farewell lunches and
teas. The trio will travel in Norway and
Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, Switzer-
land and Spain, and intend coming back
by America; and that’s something like a
trip! Lute carries a mountain of introduc-
tions to near-royalties, almost-anarchists,
Lords and Commons, and to everybody of
note that she does not already know- in Lon-
don’s singing world. Stella George, of Neu-
tral Bay, goes wflth them.
You never can tell where a girl will take
you. Now, there is H. E. Pratten, who has
been a possible Prime Minister any time the
last three weeks. He was running a little
printery when, through marriage, he became
deeply involved in
jam. From jam it
seems only a step to
tin. Mr. Pratten
took it, and that
gave him enough
money to let himself
settle down comfort-
ably in politics.
Queerly enough,
there was an earlier
almost-parallel case.
G. B. Edwards, hav-
ing married into the
Peacock family, left
his little country
printery to go into
the jam business, and
a few years later
was first Federal
member for South
Sydney. An accident robbed the country of
his solid services many years too soon. The
picture with this is May Moore’s latest of
Mr. Pratten.
Other travellers by the big liner will be
David Jones’s Miss O’Keeffe {she goes off
to the high altars of Fashion in Paris) and
the,, T. J. Daltons. But they go only as
far as Colombo, where they will meet and
turn back with Mark Sheldon’s lady.
Artist Elioth Gruner is going away to
Europe. He has packed his last tube of
color, and is now sitting back to enjoy the
parties that are being given him every day
of the week. The Cavalier Club is making
him the guest of honor at its next monthly
dinner, and, with unbelievable generosity,
each member, after he has paid 13s. 6d. for
his own consumption, is chucking in a
half-dollar for a presentation.
It was the rouseabout at an up-country
pub who gave Gruner the highest unsolicited
testimonial on record. Syd Smith had gone
up to do a week-end’s sketching, and while
he was roughing in the old barn the odd-job
man engaged him in friendly chat. “Know
a chap in Sydney called Gruner?’’ he ques-
tioned. Syd admitted the crime. “Well,
Gruner an’ a lot of other chaps come up here
a few weeks ago, paintin’.” “Um-m.” re-
turned Syd. “ ’E’s a nice chap, that Gruner
never asked ter have his boots cleaned
once. I reckon he was the best artist of the
bunch,” Syd nodded abstractedly. The
rouseabout gave Syd’s old barn a cold once-
over and spat into the arid soil. “Don’t
know that he ain’t the best artist in the
world!” he added.
. The late Mrs. . Ellis Rowan’s vast collec-
tion of flower-paintings has been the centre
of a violent storm. The Commonwealth
Government decided that the 900-odd records
of Australian and Papuan wild-flowers must
be bought, but left the price open. The sum
asked is £lO,OOO. “Ten thousand pounds
for. the work of one woman !” chorused the
artists. “And she not even in the front
rank! Who wants a thousand pictures from
one brush?” But of course this isn’t a
matter of art at all. It is a matter of
science. The Sydney Art Gallery has three
of. Mrs. Rowan’s water-colors, and that is
quite enough. But the botanists have their
collections, too; and Mrs. Rowan’s lot should
go with them. Certainly nobody else is
ever likely to do the work which the remark-
able little explorer did. Not one artist in
a hundred could. Nor one explorer in a
thousand.
Anybody who has seen Ada Reeve (and
who hasn’t?) dashing gaily and youthfully
about in “Spangles” can hardly realise she’s
a grandmother twice over—once to daughter
Goodie MacGillicuddy’s little son, and now
to Mrs. Wainwright’s brand-new baby. Ada,
who is now Mrs. Wilfrid Cotton, kicked off
as Mrs. Bert Gilbert, and the girls are two
of the foursome who were the joint posses-
sion of Ada and her once-famous scarecrow
dancer. The Gilbert-Reeve matrimonial
knot was sundered about 15 years back, and
the little Gilberts passed into tbe custody
of the present Mrs. Cotton, who looks as if
she will be still on the theatrical deck when
the future matrimonial entanglements of
baby Wainwright conspire to make her a
great-grandmother.
Blanche D’Alpuget, who has driven her
pen in the interests of nearly every news-
paper of note in Sydney, joined the Tele-
graph last week as editor of its Woman’s
Page. Blanche started out by writing short
stories, and was persuaded "into her first
“daily” job by J. D. Fitzgerald, who had
been a literary godfather to her from her
school days. During the last dread months
of his losing fight against disease, it was
to her that J.D. read the first draft of his
novel, “The Ring Valley.”
An enlarged photo of Mrs. Edith Cowan,
M.L.A., now hangs in Perth'Public Library
commemorating the election of the first
woman to an Australian Parliament. When
the picture was formally handed to the trus-
tees the other day, the political dame forth-
rightly declared that it flattered her. If she ever
had had any illusions about her appearance,
she said, they were shattered long ago by a
small daughter, who confided, “Mother, father
says you were the prettiest girl he ever saw
when you were 17. But, mother, it can’t
be true!” Premier Jimmy Mitchell re-
marked at the presentation function, “Per-
haps there will be _ other ladies in Parlia-
ment” ; then his chivalry slipped a cog and
he murmured, “but I hope they’ll be young
ones.” West Perth’s chosen cheerily pro-
mised to do all she could to get a few
younger ones in; but she wouldn’t help any
under 40. And every grizzled M.P present
simply loved the flattery.
After 23 years of it Joseph Massey has
resigned the job of juggling the stops of the
organ at St. Andrew’s Cathedral. He is
now 69, and started handling organs, with a
touch that foretold the master, in the Mud-
gee Presbyterian Church when he was 15.
If only he had kept count of the times he has
heard the Voice breathe o’er Eden at
Sassiety weddings!
Louise Wilson, daughter of Prof. “Jumbo”
Wilson, of Cambridge and late of Sydney
[Varsity, is one of the few women architects
in Scotland—if she isn’t the only one. Word
comes that she is “finishing up” with Edin-
burgh’s best-known firm, and feels very Aus-
tralian and very lonely in an office entirely
staffed by men.
Another note from England :* —
Miss. Crichton-Imrie, who used to gather all stray
Australians in London into her little cafe in Dover-
street, and feed them on passion-fruit and pine-
apple, orange and banana butter, has transferred her
activities, at the request of Agent-General Connolly,
to the Black Swan Cafe, in Savoy-street, and here
she is carrying on her self-imposed task of boosting
Australia’s products. Black linen tablecloths, witli
orange borders and centre-pieces, cover the little
tables, laid with yellow-rimmed white china, adorned
with the black swan that is the W.A. emblem. The
Crichton-Imrie is a rare plucked ’un, and Aus-
tralia ought to be grateful to her.
Mrs. Aubrey Withers, president of the
Lyceum Club, has issued cards for the first
Lyceum gathering of the year. The Women’s
Service Club in Hunter-street will give it
shelter, for the Lyceum has now no resting
place it can call its own.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Save for a little luncheon to the widow of John
Swinnerton-Dyer, who in life wore Baronet after his
name, Sir Matt, has apparently been taking a
breather from the social surge. ‘ The Swinnerton-
Dyer lady had been visiting some of the clan in
Wcstralia, and passed through on the Houtman,
bound for Java and Malaya. To meet her, Mrs.
Glynn-Connolly and Victor Bell, of Coochin, were
bidden to the vice-regal board.
Singer Norah Halford gave a jazz at Montpelier
the other night, when mauve and pink asters, pink
gerberas, and a wondrous pink Japanese umbrella
scattering gay balloons cheered up the scenery.
Among the last of the farewells to the Sagers—
who have really gone now —was a party hostessed by
Mrs. Curr, at Lennon’s, whereat a basket of asters
was handed to Mrs. Sager in a roomful of those
many-hued blooms.
Mrs. Hector Henderson filled her home with flowers
and song in honor of Lily Svensen, who herself
helped to make the music, with Hilda Forth and
Doreen Morgan.
“Bobs” Ricardo, who is the daughter of Mrs.
Arthur Street, of Sydney, announces her engagement
to Adolph Feez’s son, Cecil Molle. Mrs. Street was
a Thompson, of Brisbane, and her first husband was
Col. Ricardo. “Bob’s” real names are—Graeme
Douglas!
The W.C.T.U. delegates are in our midst, advising
Melisande not to drink too deep. At a welcome to
Mrs. Carvosso and Miss G. M. Bailey—ba'ck from
Philadelphia in the morning—bouquets, both verbal
and vegetable, were handed round.
Exquisite wild flowers were gathered round South-
port way to scent the summer air at Marjorie McCon-
nel’s supper at the Eastern tea-rooms. Col. and Mrs
Cameron, the Percy Harts, William Crombies and
Haymens, Mary Grant and Belle Sword were bidden
to sniff them.
Southport beat a visiting team at cricket the next
day. In the visitors’ team was Joshua, son of the
late “Joey” Bell. Mrs. J. T. Bell, the Tom Spencers,
and Mrs. Duckett White were among those who came
to see.

Permanent Hair Waving
Accentuates Attractiveness
The many advantages of softly waved hair are
too obvious to need much commendation. To
the smart woman, so important a part does it
play in her coiffure, that it has become quite a x
fashionable craze. Farmer’s use a special, per-
manent Kair waving process which produces
exquisite waves that remain the same even
after shampooing, and does not in any way
effect the growth, or destroy the natural sheen.
Appointments may be booked by personal
application in the Hairdressing Salon, Third

The d.c. attendance at the Royal on Satur-
day recalled old first-night times: the most
dressy and notable of _ theatre-goers in town
had booked for the circle in preference to
the front stalls. The beautiful show which
was staged under Oscar Asche’s commands
is even finer than “Maid of the Mountains,”
and a little distance probably lends en-
enactment to the view. So it was as well
that three of the four boxes (one never
counts the top-shelf) had managerial critics.
John Tait and party looked gravely down
from one pen, and the Tallises faced them.
Below his knighted chieftain sat the Wen-
mans with the pretty young Carlyon girl,
Mr. Wenman having a sharp professional
eye for Aschiatic tricks of stage management.
Between acts the word went round that a
Spanish wrap worn by Gladys Moncrieff in
the first scene was the same that Josie Col-
lins wore at her first appearance as “a
Southern maid” in London. May Beatty
had sent it round to Gladys late in the after-
noon, wishing her all the luck she wished
herself. Flowers and fuss at the finish lost
a little effect from the lateness of the hour.
Plebeians with trains and tramcars to catch
had to get away, but the large motahed sec-
tion stayed to make a brave noise.
Pam and Sheila, the Digby babies, are
being packed off round the Cape in care of
nursie; but Lord Digby and his brilliant
lady will have a long wander before making
for their Dorset home. They have left for
Maoriland, and propose to look in at China,
Japan and America before pulling up at
their English front door.
Prince Bertie will get a rise of £3OO a
week when he marries. His present pocket-
money is £lO,OOO a year, and this allow-
ance is to be increased to £25,000, so’s he
can uphold his position as a married Duke
°f York. Added to this, he has chosen a
girl who is rich enough to buy her own
cigarettes. Perhaps, after all, the £25,000
?rr/ ear r is not Pocket-money, but a screw.
When Lady Betty was being interviewed she
naively remarked that she “supposed they
would live in London, as Bertie must be
near his work.” The bewildered pressman
never thought of finding out just what
“work’ Bertie did,, and whether he intended
to live near a “tube” or take a ’bus of a
morning. Bettikins simply wallowed in
interviews during the first few days of her
engagement, but she must have chattered
too freely, for tsreSs' ‘ talks were suddenly
shut down. Some Wallington in the back-
ground evidently murmured “Better not.”
Melba has now her very own perch in
London. She has bought a house in Mans-
field-street, Cavendish-square, and intends
to establish herself there this month. By
the way, the Dame doesn’t miss many points
in advertising. She blew along to Covent
Garden Theatre the other morning to gloat
over the queue waiting for gallery seats. The
patient prospective gods cheered the diva as
she walked along the line, chatting with
some and passing out photographs to others.
Since the Opposition got in its broadside
that no Imperial appointee, however exalted,
was required to represent the State in Lon-
don, we have not heard any more about the
Stradbroke “special mission” to London. His
Ex. will now probably carry out his original
intention of looking after his private affairs
when he goes for his trip, and do it without
pay.
Gregory Ivanofif, lately appointed to the
teaching staff at Melbourne ’Varsity, is a
cousin of the Cherniavsky trio. Gregory
s p ec *^* ses on the fiddle, like cousin Leo of
the less pronounceable name, and, like
Leo and other musical Russians, he is
almost as sane as a bank manager. The
Albert-street Conservatorium is likewise pro-
vided with a new violin expert, Gertrude
Healy being the lady in the case. Gertrude
takes her bow as “principal study teacher,”
so will not, one supposes, be worried by
having to teach the very young idea how to
scrape catgut.
The Henry Butler widow, who is off for a
trip to Lunnon shortly, has split up her
immense Brighton dwelling into a series of
gorgeous flats. A large enough section has
been retained to house the plate, motor-cars
and antiques upon which, during his lifetime
with the Sargood firm, her late husband so
strenuously lavished his cash. Mrs. Butler,
by the way, is one of the few wealthy Mel-
bournites to employ a girl-chauffeur.
The ranks of truly-distinguished Toorak-
ites are about to be swelled by constitution-
alist John Quick, who is satiated with the
whirl of life at Bendigo. S’John has a wide
circle of friends in Melbourne, and even by
the Yarraside his years of retirement are not
likely to be lonely.
The death of Corporal L. Iredale, A.1.F.,
removes one of the gamest Anzacs who sur-
vived the Peninsula. He escaped with two
wounds, one in the thigh, the other through
both shoulders, and it was the latter which
baffled the best treatment obtainable and fin-
ished him in the Caulfield Military Hospital
last week. He had 16 operations, and on the
word of the doctor he must have suffered
continuous weakness and pain. Yet, with
all his disabilities, he studied at the Mel-
bourne Uni. for a degree in Electrical Engin-
eering, several times abandoning his books
temporarily for the operating table, and
then, after his manyth convalescence, return-
ing to resume where he had left off. His
16th encounter with the surgeons occurred
just after the exam., but, though his spirit
was indomitable, liis system wasn’t strong
enough to let him learn the result.
Dr. Mackeddie has roped in a locum to
keep things going while he and his wife visit
ms native Fog. Umpteen years back Mac-
keddie, then a new-chum schoolmastering for
a crust, contracted a yearning to switch over
to the doctoring profession, and he topped
off long days of teaching with even longer
nights of learning, until he had cleared the
last of his medical hurdles.
In her blue Guide trappings, Miss Robin-
son, the personable young damsel who has
been brought overseas to act as mainspring
of the Girl Guide toy, might be mistaken for
a she-policeman on a more elaborate scale,
bhe is now beating up reinforcements among
the factory ’ands —gives them lunch-hour
intervals of stump oratory, while they quiz
her accent, her cocked hat and the hang of her
blue tailorings. The movement, it seems, was
an effort to tame the after-war girl, who
had joyously kicked off her petties and gone
male in her brother’s pants and waistcoats,
lhank Heaven, we have none of that brand
here to be leg-roped! The Guide stunt offers
no fresh thrill to the factory flapper (already
hedged in with clubs, for her mental, moral
and physical uplift)—none, at any rate, save
the uniform; and that will only add to the
hideous cost of living.
The Ken Brodribb widow, who, with her
two unmarried daughters, was dodging the
English chills by visiting Monte Carlo
passed out suddenly the other day She was
a sister of the late Richard Casey, whose
widow left Australia a month or two ago to
trip abroad with her sister-in-law and nieces.
This is a Ruskin photo of Isabelle Bredin,
who gets a full share of the local musical
limelight as a dramatic soprano and teacher.
Her own fine voice has been polished by
years of study, first at home, then abroad,
winding up with
the great Randaeg-
ger in Milan. It was
after a brief but suc-
cessful flash in
grand opera in
America that Isa-
belle Bredin came
and squatted at Too-
rak; and she has
had a stage built,
whereon her pupils
can study opera
roles. Incidentally,
the fair Isabelle is
about to seal a mat-
rimonial contract
with one George Fair-
bairn. He is not
the Toorak Senator,
so be careful how
you address your congratulations.
\erna Johnson had a sad but exciting ex-
perience the other day after a motor jaunt
to the western coast, so the story goes. The
day was warm, the sea looked invitingly at
Verna and her companion, and they left the
car on the cliff whilst they went down for
a swim. It was the high-bred car that the
heiress had so lately brought with her across
the seas. Trusting to its good behavior, they
forgot to put the full stop on, and it seems
that a wind blowing off the cliff noticed
their forgetfulness. The first thing they saw
from down on the sea-level was the costly
vehicle coming after them.
Ur. Margaret McLorinan, of Collins-
street, was fined £3 the other day for driving
her car on the wrong side of St. Kilda-road.
The lady, when interviewed by Robert, said:
“It is my business to save as much time
as possible.” The same “life or death” ex-
cuse was lately advanced by a male medico
when he was summoned for too-fast motor-
ing. The idea that a furiously-driven car
is more likely _to kill, a.wayfarer than the
doc. occupant is to cure his patient, never
occurs to your medical egoist.
Sam Mackay, who has made a plucky
fight against accident and ill-health, is again
taking a live interest in his horses, and is
adding to his string.
The name Cavendish cropped up so often
recently in polite Sassiety that the Very
Naicest had their chance. “Cov-endish,”
murmured Miss Much Travelled over her
Spode teacup. Miss Stay-at-Home pricked
up her ears—then she Cov-endished all over
her next tea-party. And so it goes on travel-
ling—though a mere man declares that
smokers who use that old brand continue to
pronounce it exactly as it is spelt.
Melbourne will miss the gentle Goll and
his powerful interpretations of Beethoven
and Chopin during the next 12 months. Hav-
ing been granted long leave by the ’Varsity
Council, he and his wife are off for a lazy
holiday abroad. The Mayor gave him a civic
farewell on Thursday morning, at which
Prof. Allen, representing the Council, waxed
enthusiastic over Goll’s good deeds in Mel-
bourne’s musical world.
. Herewith Theyre Weigall, K.C., who has
Dust been sentenced to 12 months on the
bench, as understudy to Leo Cussen, who is
wandering overseas.
He is the eldest of
five brainy brothers,
all “Old Melbur-
nians,” and in the
professional lime-
light. Reggie, Gerald
and Albert sport
medical brass-plates,
and Willie is a solici-
tor. Theyre, who is
keen on sport, is
president of the
Lawn Tennis Asso-
ciation, and up till
last year was one of
the wise men on the
council of his old
school. In his
leisure moments he
woos the literary
muse, and prose and verse from his
pen have appeared in the weekly
press. His son and heir, Theyre, developed
the writing complaint in a more virulent
form, and recently cut adrift from the
Herald to join the staff of the London
Daily Mail. The young man’s mother
has just steamed off to establish her off-
spring in the Fog, and to renew acquaint-
ance with her own folk, whom she has not
seen since landing in the Speck umpteen
years back, with her late vice-regal father,
Sir Robert Hamilton.
Sydney artist Charlie Bryant—he of the
spotted tie—is to do some War Museum
paintings in ex-German New Guinea. He
is to be in Rabaul in September, so that the
conditions may be climatically the same as
they were when our boys made their entry.
Apparently historic scenes are to be recon-
structed. But it is rather late in the day
for that, since all the militarv atmosphere
has melted, and the artist wiil need to do
considerable digging to get the dinlcum oil.
Most of the officers and men who belonged
to that time are scattered over the globe—
he could find many of them in Australia.
Since the war days there has arisen in
Rabaul a people who knew not Fritz, and
they won’t be able to do much to help a
man chasing elusive history with a mahl-
stick.
The Johanna Hop idea is very modern
and up-to-date, but many years ago iVfel-
bourne had a perfect policewoman who had
no official title and created the job for her-
self. Miss Sutherland, that magnificent Scot
who became famous for the care of “un-
wanted Australians,” was in the real sense a
policewoman. The Force consulted her in
most of the women “cases,” and it always
got fine, blunt, straight-from-the-shoulder
advice on the best course of procedure. The
gaunt woman with the big heart understood
her weaker sisters in a way that is given
to few, aud puzzled John Hops depended in
a wholesome way on her word.
W. H. Edgar, Chairman of Committees of
the Uppah Chambah, is, with his wife, leav-
ing by the Macedonia on Feb. 3 for a trip
to the Cold Land. 1
The spirit of goodwill was encouraged by
an unusual event at a seaside resort during
the holidays. A waitress at a fashionable
pub took ill, and two nurses, who happened
to be on the premises, were suddenly bidden
to help a young Australian into the world.
The unhappy mother hadn’t a garment or
any other necessaries for the infant, but
that was soon remedied by the houseful of
guests. _ The hat was sent round and came
back brimming with enough to provide the
girl and her offspring with a handsome outfit
and a bit over. Baby is doing well, and its
parent has been made to feel that the world
isn’t such a bad place, after all.
One of the few genuine fragments of the
original Blarney Stone is embedded between
the blocks of the tower-top at violinist Harold
Harvie’s Yarra Glen week-endery. The chip,
handed down from another generation with
a certificate of dinkumness, is placed about
four feet below the coping of the tower-roof,
so that anybody wishing to kiss it has to
be suspended from aloft by his pals—or her
pals, as the case may be —after the tradi-
tional fashion of saluting the parent stone
in Ireland.
The wife of a Melbourne turfite went
away to the Riverina. for a holiday, leaving
her cheque-provider alone in the house Mrs.
Rumor, in a letter to the tripper, hinted that
the boss was brightening up the empty home
with a flaring henna-beauty of expensive
habits. There was no train back to Mel-
bourne within what the wife considered a
reasonable time, so she simply hired a car
and set off on a 200-odd mile run home.
Hub., with a still empty house on his hands
and nobody at all on his vacant knee,
astoundedly met wifie on the doorstep, while
the car-driver awaited his cheque. The fact
that Mrs. Rumor had spoken a vain thing is
now causing the hasty one to suffer from
a grievously-slashed dress-allowance.
Gran’ma Argus is an ascetic old thing.
In earlier days ladies with big gardens and
comfortable homes usually had a few bottles
of “cordials” on their shelves, a habit im-
ported from the self-contained farmsteads of
Britain. But Gran’ma, recently asked bow
to make cherry brandy and home-made
wines, “preferred not to give recipes for
alcoholic drinks.” This in a galloping age
wherein the native-born grand-dam, upon
whose approval the Argus depends, thinks
nothing of dropping in somewhere mid-
mornimr for a Martini and a cigarette.
Melbourne is still gasping over the news
that, at Newcastle (N.S.W.), the other day,
a man who stripped himself naked as he
swam saved a man and woman from drown-
ing. The thing is unbelievable. It simply
could not be done off any of our bay
beaches. If a man attempted it he’d be
nabbed by 15 bobbies, and there’d be a fat
mayor sitting on his chest reading the Riot
Act long before he got to his undershirt.
Melbourne’s wowsery worry about clothes-
for-bathers has reached the limit of old-
maidishness. At Williamstown the regula-
tions now insist on not only a bathing-gown
but a kilt as well, even for men. It only
remains for some Bumble to come along and
see a kilt clinging clammily to somebody’s
legs and we’ll be ordered into crinolines.
Melbourne’s seaside subbubs concentrate so
much on clothes that they have no time to
think of decency in dressing-sheds. A
bather in the existing sheds has no more
privacy than a goldfish. And, on a hot,
crowded night, the Black Hole of Calcutta
would be airy by comparison. The bathers,
shooed from any shrub shelter along the
beach, surge into these inadequate sheds and
find no room, no showers, no wading pool to
cleanse their feet of sand —only dripping
gowns, damp flesh, soggy language and wet
sand.
Talking of Melbourne’s Botanical Gar-
dens, planned to appear twice as spacious as
they really are, the revisiting Cooper, whom
Sydney lured from the curatorship of Alex-
andra-avenue to supervise parks and gardens
in the warmer city, suggested the making of
a motor-drive around the Botanical within
the gates, because, he said, motorists outside
the gates get no chance of seeing that every-
thing in the garden’s lovely. Perish the sug-
gestion. Every inch of room in the Botani-
cal should be kept sacred to beautification
purposes. A motor-drive is a hard, unpic-
turesque thing, troubled with an incidental
sm<?ll which is not healthy for vegetable
growth. Besides, the intrusion would not
stop at an all-round-the-ring motor track,
where small kiddies might find destruction.
It would be followed by a central drive, in-
troducing more dust, danger, busted-tyre
alarums, and unbotanical smell.
A little gossip from Adelaide: —
At time of writing' Clare is packed for its annual
polo tournament. Settlement has boomed there-
abouts lately, and in addition to such old-established
families as the Hawkers and Angases there is a big
sprinkling of newcomers —Colleys and Ayerses and
Woods and the rest, most of them more concerned with
vines than sheep, but none the less keen poloists. The
surrounding districts spilled in their populace too—
Barritts and Murrays and Keyneses, the C.H. and
Ronald Angases, Warnes and Gordon Law-Smiths—
and the town contingent included the C. T. Brays,
Crawfords, Fred Porters, C. J. Coles, Cudmores,
etc. A Victorian, Joan Stawell, annexed the ladies’
flag and barrel race (Mrs. Edward Hawker was a
Stawell), and other feminine prize-winners were
Mrs. Gordon Law-Smith and Miss Birks.
By the way, the C. H. Angases are among the
innumerable S. Australians who’ve booked pas-
sages for England; wherefore he has resigned from
the oouncil of the Royal Agricultural Society—a seat
he has held since ’B9.
Meanwhile Glenelg is having its little jamboree,
and is turning itself into a Chinese village for a
week or so, with the idea of wiping off the £l5OO
still wanted towards the £5OOO for the soldiers’
memorial hall.
The estate of Mrs. Roy Taylor, who died whilst
on a trip to England with her husband, has been
sworn at £ 32,000-odd.
The Victor Hugo and its belongings left us with
lamentations on both sides, more or less adequately
expressed in the usual speeches, and vouched for
by 80 of the sailors in a special letter of
thanks to Consul Frank Moulden and his lady. Inci-
dentally, 9000 gallons of S. Australian wine have
gone with the cruiser—all from one vineyard near
Rowland’s Flat.
An American firm has bought the copyright of
two of Edith Aird’s Songs. Any amateur mummer
in this village can testify to her knack for versify-
ing and play-writing, and when a local musician
showed some of her /work to a New York publishing
co., last year, it was promptly annexed.

There was lusty hooting at Randwick
when the Maoriland-bred mare Radiant Light, owned
by A. P. Wade and ridden by P. Brown, streaked
past the judge’s box lengths ahead of Master Cagou
and Wildun in the Anniversary Handicap. Six
days before, after drifting curiously in the betting
on the January Handicap, she had finished third-last
in a strung-out field. With two more furlongs to
travel her chance of turning the tables on Perora-
tion, the unpenalised January winner, in the Anni-
versary looked as remote as Hughes’s prospect
of leading a Cocky Cabinet, but somebody must
have backed her, for the bookmakers refused to
lay more than sevens. After Myamley and Brilliant
Sunshine had been indulged with the lead, and Wil-
dun’s jockey had ridden him into the ground, the
mare bade the field good-bye at the distance and
won with her mouth open. It was an astonishing
performance in the circumstances, and the cause of
the sudden improvement is being investigated by
the stewards.
A day after the Anniversary fixture the A.J.C.
held its first meeting at Warwick Farm. There
was nothing remarkable about the racing, which
was confined to second- and third-raters, but the
crowd was the largest ever seen at the Farm and
the volume of machine-betting' beat all previous
totals out of sight. When the scheme of improve-
ments has been carried out, Warwick Farm will be
another Caulfield. And then there will be no justi-
heation for the existence of seedy places like Moore-
held or Canterbury Park or the direful pony courses.
* * * *
"C.D.” “Bunty” Brown, who rode Radi-
Light in the Anniversary Handicap, is about
the tallest jockey in the business. Once when Brown
was weighing-in after a successful ride, a fellow-
norseman remarked or, his unusual height. “Yes,”
another youth, “if ‘Bunty* grows much longer
they*ll have to run him in divisions.’*
* * * *
“Lexite” : My neighbor in the tram which
took me to the Sydney Cricket Ground on Anniver-
sary Day had been looking upon the ale when it
was pale, and thought his seat was a sleeping-
berth. Arrived at my destination, I woke him up
ana set him on the right road for the gate. Later
on he lurched into the grandstand, and seeming to
recall my face insisted upon shaking hands with
me and asking about the wife and family. There-
upon he went to sleep again. The shout of the
crowd when Macartney caught Hartkopf woke him up.
He looked round in a wild, puzzled fashion. “Hey,
cobber,” he said, “was that the finish of the Handi-
cap? What won?” It took some time to convince
him that he had come to the wrong shop. “Cripes,”
he said, “I came out to put a tenner on Radiant
Light.”
The Newmarket Handicap pro-
blem has been made a little less difficult by the sale
of Rostrum for the Indian market. Eric Connolly
entered three likely ones—Rostrum, Sunburst and
Polytheist—and, having- been second and first in two
Newmarket attempts, Rostrum was bound to be
a fancied candidate, provided the handicapper gave
him any sort of a chance. The trouble in judging
E.C.’s trio was that two of them had already
shown first-class sprinting form, whilst the other is
an unbeaten colt, thus far. To be sure, Polytheist
ran in only two races last season, and has been
kept in the dark ever since, but the glamor of “an
unbeaten three-year-old” envelops the son of Poly-
melus and Cranbrook, and because his form doesn’t
reveal how good the colt may be, he gets credit,
probably, for being 50 per cent, better than he is.
A more bewildering haze of uncertainty surrounds
some entrants for Autumn meetings that may emerge
Scobie’s stable. The imported Hayhope and
Stnlhnglee were each of them winners in England at
two and three years respectively, since when they have
been getting acclimatised in Melbourne without giving
any indication as to whether the change of climate
has agreed with them. Imported Scorpius, from
W estralia, is also lodged in S'cobie’s stable. In this
case the difficulty is to guess (1) whether his recent
performances in the West were the best the English-
man is likely to do, and (2) how much value should
be placed on that form now Scorpius haTs come out
of the West.
The return match between Victoria and
N. S. Wales was played with rare keenness, and the
gates on Friday and Saturday were the highest
in the history of the Sheffield Shield competition.
At the end of the first day’s play the Victorians
looked pretty sure to retain the trophy. They bad
lost five wickets for 320, which would have been
at least 350 if the outfield hadn’t been dead.
Ryder (71), Park (65 mo.), Hartkopf (63), Rans-
ford (40), and Willis (24 n. 0.) made the bowl-
ing look simple. Nor did the general opinion change
when the other five wickets fell in 43 minutes for
32, Scott finishing up with 3 for 83 and Mailey
with 3 for 95. For Bardsley, Andrews, Taylor and
Kelleway went cheaply, and five first-class men were
out for 164. But Collins (102), Macartney (65),
Kippax (197) and Hendry (93) saved the side.
Collins batted coolly and confidently for 212 minutes,
and fell to a catch behind the wickets —his one
faulty stroke—when dog-tired. Kippax was tenth
man out —he was caught at point off Liddicut when
trying to force the pace—and his great innings,
which lasted 319 minutes, was in every respect
worthy of Trumper, on whom the youngster has
modelled his delightful style. And Hendry, by help-
ing Kippax to put on 168 for the seventh wicket,
assisted to pluck victory from the jaws of defeat.
The innings closed for 560, Ryder (3 for 103) and
Wallace (3 for 104) securing the best of a bad lot
of averages. Before the disastrous third day was
over, Victoria had lost Woodfull (24), Ransford
(36), Park and Mayne, who failed in both knocks,
for 88, Scott getting three of them cheaply. Mailey
(5 for 73) and Oldfield, the wicket-keeper, com-
pleted the job on Tuesday morning, and N. S.
Wales won by an innings and 28 runs. Except in
outfielding, where Ransford and Woodfull were
supreme, they beat the visitors in every department
of the game.
Kippax plays for Waverley, and has been in
wonderful form this year. Against South Aus-
tralia he scored 170 in Adelaide and 51 in Sydney;
and Victoria’s bowling he belted for 68 and 5 in
Melbourne and 197 in Sydney—49l runs, averag-
ing 98.2. In premiership games, Kippax has made
288 runs, averaging 72; and against Maclaren’s
XI he contributed 34 and 14. In Sydney grade
cricket last year his total of runs was 497, and
his average 55.22. Alan’s only trip outside Aus-
tralia was with Ransford’s XI to M.L. in 1920-21 ;
he was sixth on the honor list with 415 runs,
averaging 34.58. If he is still available when (Le
next Australian XI is picked, nothing short of
an earthquake should keep him out of it.
IT. L. HENDRY, the N.S.W. all-rounder.
He made a sparkling 93 at a critical
stage of the match against Victoria.
Adelaide club cricket has been made more
interesting by East Torrens losing a match. It had not
previously lost one this season, or last. E.T. is the
old Norwood club, the home of Giffen and Lyons
long ago. (The name is so valued that in foot-
ball the district is still allowed to call itself Nor-
wood.) Shortly before the war it had all the Hills
and the Chamberlains, also Crawford, Mayne and
Whitty. Losing them, it has built up another team
locally, almost unbeatable. It has put into the
S.A. XI (out of the present players alone) Arthur
Richardson and Morton (the tempted of South Mel-
bourne), Murray and Stirling (of the A.I.F. XT)
Loveridge, Middleton, Rymil] and Schultz. The
recent beating was administered by Sturt, which nad
not won a match from East Torrens since before the
war. It was mainly due to the batting of Gould
and the bowling of Townsend—himself an E T
player till last season.
S.A. Cricket Association has decided that
Arthur Richardson, though approaching the veteran
stage, is too valuable an asset to be allowed to
leave. So to keep him in Adelaide it will make up
the difference between what he gets from his iob
in the Waterworks Department and what South
Melbourne offered him. In return he will do some
coaching.
- * * *
“Croweater”: It was the S.A,C.A.’s own
fault that Morton, the fast bowler, went to South
Melbourne (B 25/l/’23). He was a country
player when his form attracted notice, but promises
to find him a job in Adelaide were not fulfilled. He
tried for numerous positions, but for six months he
was out of work, the S.A.C.A. being quite content
to do nothing _ for him. Then South Melbourne
ottered him a job which would enable him to con-
tiiiue in the game, on which he is exceptionally
(\ een > a nd » quite naturally, he accepted it. Clearly,
the Adelaide authorities are close-fisted and too
slow to catch caterpillars, but it is no use blamino-
the astute South Melbourne crowd.

Tren : A great North Melbourne cricket-
ing' family are the Carltons. Pour of them, Will,
•Jack, Alf and Tom, have represented Victoria in
inter-state matches. On January 13 they had a
wonderful day, for old Will, playing for North Mel-
bourne seconds against University seconds, got 6
wickets for 1 run; Jack, for Brunswick seconds
against Kew seconds, took 5 for 41; and Tom, for
Aorth Melbourne against Uni., bagged 8 for 55.
lom was twelfth man for Victoria in the
match against N. S. Wales. In 1920, against
r.- ?• Males, m Sydney, he took 3 for
, 140 ' r ‘ innings of 521, and with the bat
aiera ed 45. In the same year he played against
the A.I.F. team, taking 2 for 42 in an' innings of
311, and averaging with the bat 40. Tom, who has
been coaching Maorilanders for a couple of years,
is a left-hander who can keep a length, while turn-
lng them a bit and varying his pitch, pace and
flight, but is not likely to do anvthing wonderful
unless conditions favor him. On a bad wicket he
might go through any team.

In a special handicap at Sydney Cricket
?nn U 2 d 0n Saturday “Slip” Carr was clocked to run
100yds. on the grass in 9 4-ssee. Carr didn’t get up
top speed over the first 25yds., and thousands would
have bet that he hadn’t broken even time, but three
A.A.A. officials certify that he equalled the Austral-
asian record established by the late Billy Macpher-
son at Auckland in 1891. Carr, a splendidly-built
young fellow, is indisputably the fastest Australian
sprinter since Donaldson, who has a record of 9§sec
on a prepared track, and twice did 9 3-ssec. on the
grass. But the Sydney man will have to be at his
top to beat the American Kirksey, who ran an even-
time hundred nine days after he landed from Van-
couver, and the Maorilander Traeev, who, receiving
/jy, from Kirkse y in a furlong race at Wellington
(M.U.), led him home by 2yds. in 22sec. flat.

“Winkle”: Allow me to finish the feud I
began with my contention that Ilartkopf is the
tmest all-rounder that ever passed through a
v«* ,P ub , hc school. Dr. Park or Carl Willis, also
old Wesley boys, would have cut a better figure
than any of the four mentioned by “Azrim ” but
these, briefly, are Hartkopf’s claims. As a boy
at Scotch College, he won the athletic supremacy
tor his age four years running. Then in 190 S
became tiack champion. Next vear he won

which he did not start. A fortnight later he

100 wickets and scored 1000 runs in each of his

one of the tennis four in 1907-08-09. In 1910 he

The 3tatemen t that “Australia
isn™ 5 v ? ars for an °tber Barney Ivieran” (B
18/1/ 28) is unjust to the Victorian, Frank Beaure-
paire. Beaurepaire gained his first Australian title
m the year Charlton was born. No other Austra-
lian swimmer has won so many championships or
placed so manv records in the book. And his times
tor 440yds., 1360yd5., 1760yd5., 1000 metres and 1500
metres were all made in 1921—11 years after he
returned from Europe the acknowledged world’s cham-
pmn. I class Beaurepaire as the greatest swimmer
Australia has produced. Against Ross, at Adelaide,
ho chipped a junk off the world’s record for 1000
metres, reducing it to 14-.31. At Honolulu, in
May, 1921, he reduced his time for 1000 metres,
and the world’s records for 1500 metres and the
mile, in the one swim, unpaeed. The Hawaiian
Association passed these as world’s records, but they
had to be forwarded to the International Swimming-
Federation, through the Athletic Union of America,
which endorsed the papers “made in tidal water,”
and the International Federation did not pass them.
But Beaurepaire swam under precisely the same
conditions as Ivahanamoku when he established his
world’s record of 53 4-ssec. for the 100yds., and
the Hawaiian Association is insisting on recognition
of Bogey’s great feat.

lii these dull times Sydney Stadium’s best
box-olfice attraction is George Mendies, boss of the
flyweight division. On Saturday the little Portu-
guese-Australian gave away nearly a stone and
administered a beating to Les Waters in 20 rounds
of brilliant boxing.
Using his weight for
all it was worth,
Waters did the better
work in the early
rounds, but when the
referee stopped the
rough stuff Mendies
prevailed. He dropped
the bigger lad with a
well-timed left in the
15th, but rallying
strongly in the next
round, Waters knocked
the little ’un through
the ropes. However,
Mendies came back and
got all over his man.
He was indisputably
master in the 18th and
19th, and Waters was
a well-beaten bantam
in the 20th, but strug-
gled on gamely till
the bell.

In the difficult art of sailing a boat m
squally weather Chris Garland, owner of Mele
Bilo, has few equals. This was demonstrated to
the satisfaction of Brisbane sportsmen in an event-
ful handicap, sailed under boisterous conditions
over the Hamilton-Boggy Creek course, the
AVestralian victory being due to the sterling skill
and watermanship of Garland and his men. But,
in the race for the championship and the Mark
Foy Cup, the Perth boat had to strike her colors
to the Queenslanders Vision and Vione, and to
Kismet, one of the Sydney representatives. In the
first of the three tests Vione had beaten Vision
by a second. But in Saturday’s struggle Vision
rounded the Boggy Creek buoy XOsec. ahead, and,
although Vione’s skipper, Watts, made desperate
attempts to reduce the margin, and almost drew
level at one stage, Vision was 6sec. to the good
at the finish, with Kismet four minutes further away
and Mele Bilo two minutes behind Kismet. The
winner is owned and skippered by C, Clark, who
handled her admirably.

It was raining briskly in Sydney and
blowing hard from the south when Anniversary
Day dawned, but the clouds cleared away, the wind
moderated, and those who watched the annual
regatta, from steamers, yachts and motor-boats, saw
seme exhilarating sport. There were two races for
18ft. boats, one of which went to W. Edney’s Swas-
tika, and the other to W. Fisher’s Australia, which
had finished third in the contest that Swastika won.
W. Rayment’s Snowdrop lifted the cruisers’ handi-
cap, .T. Palmer’s Aoma landed first prize in the all-
yachts, and W. E. Arnott’s Nettle beat five others,
including the G.-G.’s Corella, in the 21ft. restricted
class. It was Nettle’s seventh success this season,
and she has since added to her astonishing
achievements by winning a severe ocean race from
start to finish. The water was too choppy for the
oarsmen, heavy-service boats excepted, and their part
of the programme was carried out on the Lane
Cove River next day. Mosman were far and away
the best among the senior fours, and Balmain col-
lected the maiden and junior events. And a
promising debut was made by C. Lorrimer, a 17-
year-old Leichhardt lad, in the single sculls. He
had 20see. start from A. G. Bull, who owns the
Australian title, and sculled home four lengths to
the good in 6min. 49sec.
* * * *
The metropolitan crews hadn’t it all their
own way at the Upper Yarra regatta. Ballarat City
won the maiden eights and the lightweight maiden
fours, and Sandhurst annexed the maiden pairs and
fours. Albert Park prevailed in the senior fours
after an exciting race with Mercantile in the second
heat, and in the last scramble with Melbourne. The
senior sculls was a disappointment; Barton, the
Richmond crack, led most of the way from Cam-
bridge, the Sandhurst hope, but was disqualified on
a protest for fouling.

“Baseline” : I should like to know the
name of the dealer in sporting-goods who supplied
“F. Clinton” (B. 25/l/’23) with an “inferior”
tennis-racquet for a fiver. That price will secure
about the best produced by any reputable maker,
and if it doesn’t give first-class service, “Clintor,”
or anyone else, wouldn’t require a squad of
police to get his money back. But good racquets
are obtainable at a much smaller figure. I am
still using a weapon which cost me 455. five years ago
—the present cost is about 10s. more—and I’ve
played with it in all weathers without having it
restrung. Tennis balls are certainly expensive
but I don’t know any manufacturer who is getting
wealthy by “exploiting the names of prominent
players, as “F. Clinton” expresses it. Tennis-
players know perfectly well that the name of a
champion on a racquet is no more guarantee of its
superiority than the patronymic of some English
pro. on a cricket bat. B
THE WATCHERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When Gordon’s score gradually approached that
of Petersham, male onlookers went for a walk in
an attempt to settle their nerves. Some ladies shut
their eyes as the bowler was about to deliver the
ball, and relied on their hearing sense to tell them
whether the ball hit the bat or the wicket.” — C. O.
Macartney in Sydney News.
The Sydneyite views placidly the frantic feints and
shifts
Which Billy Hughes employs to mitigate his pain-
ful end:
The pleading Hughesite eyes and the imploring hands
he lifts
Provoke no more than yawns from those who to
his case attend.
But when the lads of Petersham and Gordon take
the field,
And when the smitten ball towards the distant
picket flies,
Stern men, before whose brain and brawn the Kaiser’s
legions reeled,
Grow weak, and gentle women are constrained to
veil their eyes.
The folks who look to Moscow fill the air with
dreadful threats,
The point is made that anarchy, red anarchy, is
near:
Pale wowsers from the U.S.A. rebuke the local Wets,
The Wets reply, but neither earns so much as one
round cheer.
Impassive culm pervades the land until to Petersham
A Gordon wicket falls; then instantly excited cries
Are heard, and males yell, “Bonzer”; or, contrari-
wise, “Oh, damn 1 ”
And women find the strain too much, and cover
up their eyes.
I.et Frenchmen strive to squeeze the blood from bone-
dry German stones;
Let Ireland still in Irish gore wade daily ankle-
deep,
While children, starved and fatherless, proclaim with
feeble moans
That though the food they need is dear, their
health and lives are cheap.
The patrons of the cricket ground on all this wrath
and woe
Can gaze and feel no sentiment save cold, aloof
surprise.
Nations may fall: it’s only when the batsmen start
to go
That men on hill and 'Stand collapse, and women
hide their eyes.

To Avoid Sickness.
To avoid and to overcome sickness of all
kinds, watch your bowels. Don’t allow old
fermenting food to stay in them for days,
but get it out.
If your stomach is disordered, or your
bowels constipated, if you feel sluggish,
dizzy or bilious, get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets at once.
They act directly upon the liver, regulate
the bowels, invigorate the stomach, cleanse
the system. The result is a relish for food,
increased strength and a clear head.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are good for con-
stipation, sour stomach and gases on the
stomach. A single dose often relieves these
troubles.
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strength-
en them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
have none of the sickening qualities of pills,
and do not produce an unpleasant effect.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be
due to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many folks who always feel tired and only
"half alive” will be surprised how much
better they will feel when they get rid of this
matter which has been poisoning their system
for days.
Nervousness, sleeplessness and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poison-
ing of the system through poisons left in the
bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness,
so-called weak and fluttering heart, are often
caused by pressure of gas in the intestines—
this gas may originate from decaying food in
the system.
A man is seldom sick when his bowels are
regular, and never well when they are
irregular. Bear this in mind and take
Chamberlain's Tablets as occasion may
require. There is nothing better. They
are mild and gentle in their action and
pleasant to take.
• Old Age.
Old age as it comes in the orderly process
of nature is a beautiful and majestic thing.
It stands for experience, knowledge, wisdom,
counsel. That is old age as it should be,
but old age as it often is means poor digestion,
torpid bowels, a sluggish liver and a general
feeling of ill health, despondency and mi'ery.
This in almost every instance is wholly
unnecessary. One of Chamberlain’s Tablets
taken immediately after supper will improve
the digestion, tone up the liver and regulate
the bowels. That feeling of despondency
will give way to one of hope and good cheer.

CHAMBERLAIN’S TABLETS are
an ideal preparation for relieving
Boils. Pimples and blood disorders.
They cleanse the stomach and liver,
thus purifying the blood. An occasional
dose of Chamberlain’s Tablets will
prevent a recurrence of the Boils.
If you wish to try before you buy, send
your address and twopence for postage to
Chamber lain’s Ltd., 520 Riley St., Sydney, N.S.W.
Children’s Ailments.
Children, like adults, are subject to
disorders of the stomach, liver and oowels,
and many of the apparently alarming ailments
of childhood are due to these causes.
Constipation is a common trouble among
children and is often the cause of seeming
stupidity at lessons and also of many an
exhibition of temper.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable for
■children. They are pleasant and safe to take
and absolutely without harsh effect.
Half a Tablet is sufficient for children from
six to twelve: for children under six, one-third
of a Tablet will have the desired effect.
If your child is bilious, if its appetite is
poor and variable, if it is fretful and
nattering, restless in its sleep, you may be
sure that its stomach is out of order and a
few doses of’ Chamberlain’s Tablets will
quickly set it right.

Five Hours on its Own Momentum
—An Achievement Possible only with Ball Bearings.
Five hours of motion without power! Unbelievable —but neverthe-
less an actual fact, as demonstrated by this fly-wheel type alternator
which revolved on its own momentum for five hours.
Four SKF-marked self-aligning ball bearings are used to support the
revolving parts running at 500 r.p.m., and weighing 44,000 pounds.
You can imagine the amount of energy which the use of ball bearings, as compared with
plain bearings, saves in the course of a year in any plant. Since the saving in each machine
is added to that of the others, the total is no mean quantity, and represents a substantial
increase in plant efficiency and a worth-while economy.
hen self-aligning ball bearings are used friction is practically eliminated and marked economies effected as
well in lubrication and maintenance. See that your electrical machinery is ball-bearing equipped.

THE INKY WAY.
“J.H.” (London) : As foreshadowed some weeks ago,
Wickham-Steed has received his conge from the
Times editorship, and the paper may be expected
•to revert to its sound, steady policy of pre-North-
cliffe days. Geoffrey Dawson, the new editor, was
in command from 1912 to 1919, in which year,
refusing- to be made a Northcliffe doormat, he
resigned. He is a Fellow of All Souls’, Oxford, was
editor of the Johannesburg Star for five years, and
before that was in the Colonial Office, closely'
associated with Lord Milner. Dawson lacks Steed’s
“brilliance,” but has ten times more ballast. He
vas, and will be again, a great editor.
“J.H.” (London) : A feature of the personnel of
the newly-elected House of Commons is the number
of “pukka”, journalists represented. “Tay Pay ’
(O’Connor) heads a list which includes diehard
Ronald McNeill, formerly editor of the St. James's
Gazette ; Sir Thomas Bennett, editor and chief
proprietor of the Times of India ; Percy Hurd, of
the Outlook ; Patrick Hastings, K.C., who was a
navvy before he travelled the Inky Way; Sydney
Webb and E. D. Morel, the pacifist; and F. Martin
and J. D. Cassels, both formerly “subs” on the
Morning Post,
“E”: The suggestion of a Lawson prize for litera-
ture, something like the Archibald prize for paint-
ing, has precedent, if nothing else, to recommend it.
The Prix Goncourt in France has a fine record, a
number of famous works having secured the award.
The last prize was won by a negro novel, “Batouala,”
by Rene Maran. Tchekhof once won the Poushkin
prize in Russia. In England the Hawthornden prize
is given for works of imaginative literature, the
last two winners being John Freeman and Edmund
Blunden. Australia is a sporting country; and one
interest in a Lawson prize would be the controversial
battle it would arouse. 1 doubt if it would do
much good ; for everybody' who didn’t get the prize
would challenge the decision. Yet it might justify
itself, whatever the value of the actual award, if
it did something to create a more intelligent appre-
ciation of literature.
The little Australian Museum Magazine keeps well
up to. its average with interesting and widely-rang-
ing nature notes in the January issue. Opals,
palolo worms, some little penguins that
invaded civilisation, a visit to Lake Eyre and a
naturalist’s sojourn in the Chichester Valley are
among the things dealt with in eommendably under-
standable language; and, as usual, the illustrations
'are many and good.
“Adelaide”: That par (B. 28/12/’22) about The
Bulletin reaching Auckland on the Monday after
its publication, and “crawling down” to Wellington
on the Thursday after that, starts a topic of great
general interest to contributors. The red
cover. goes everywhere, and by a Variety
of conveyances. Somebody might write a
poem about it. It gets to Melbourne on Thursday
morning, then darts off at a'/ number of tan-;
gents. For instance, it gets to Wentworth, on
the Darling, by train and motor, on Saturday. It
reaches Adelaide on Friday morning. Still carrying
on west, it strikes lvalgoorlie on Tuesday morning
and Perth on Wednesday', a week from the start.
If it tackles the north line that should go to
Darwin but doesn’t, it gets to the end of the rails,
at Oodnadatta, on the following Friday' night—
with luck; without luck, it may be just a fort-
night later! But when does it strike Dunedin ? And
Thursday Island? And Darwin?
“Roneo”-: Bernard Cronin, who has lately sold
the serial rights of another yarn, “Salvage,” to
Stead’s Review, gets a pat on the back from Mel-
bourne Herald, which remarks that “if more people
could be found with faith in Australian work, the
lot of the local novelist would be lighter.” This
will doubtless give great joy to Cronin, who, though
on the HERALD-staff, hasn’t yet induced the journal
to print one of his yarns. Nor, apparently, has any
other local serialist. The Fink ’Un is a home for
the Great Unknown among imported tale-tellers, and
probably' wouldn’t like to mention what it pays for
the shockers.
“II Pappagallo”: Wandering round a second-hand
bookshop the other evening I bought, for three-
pence, a copy of a little grey book, “Pert and
Do!” published at the Dawn office by its authoress,
Louisa Lawson. It is rather a pathetic production
as literature, though typographically excellent, but
it has a singular, ghostly flavoring of Henry,
Louisa’s son, about it. One feels, wading through
it, that Henry is alway's lurking in the background
somewhere.
“What the old lady wanted to die for” (says the
hero, on the first page) “is a mystery to me. She
had an easy billet, had her own way mostly—fed
me how she liked and dosed me when she pleased,,
and I never so much as asked her what for; and
then . she leaves me shabbily after all, without
giving me the usual week’s notice even. By gum!
Poor old woman! I do miss her, though”....
That little extract alone suggests to me either
that .Henry- Lawson had a hand in the composition
of his mother’s work or that she was the main
influence in the formation of his early style.
“O. P. Hand” : It is just on 33 years since I first
met W. P. Little, who passed out the other day. He
was then musical critic and general staff-man •in
Melbourne Evening Standard, and wore a superior
air that matched his silk hat, and—if I remember
rightly—monocle. Also, he carried a fine tenor voice
about with him. When the Standard was swallowed
by the Herald, Little drifted on to the provincial
press, and for a few years had a paper at Kyneton
(the Independent). The light faded when he was
at Castlemaine, and he went back to Stratford, his
home village, to take the long, long rest. There
are few left of the Standard staff of 33 years ago.
“Pat Bushie” gives a friendly word of advice to
aspiring freelances :
Type all MSS, two or three spaces between lines,
and keep a carbon copy. When anything is published
cheek the print with your copy. This gives you a
chance to get the paper’s style. Also it lessens
considerably the “par-doctor’s” task, saves much of
his time, and, what is perhaps even more important,
ensures increased consideration for your efforts.
“Splinter”: I enter the toast to the press for the
prize awarded in Class A, Mockeries and Absurdities.
I’ll swear it was introduced by some aldermanie
boozer whose alcoholised soul was revolted at the
thought of the dregs in the glasses being wasted.
It means nothing. It is unto the banquet what “God
Save the King” is to the movies—-a somewhat tire-
some way of say-ing “The show is now over.”
“Te Whare”: In addition to the deluge of books
imported duty-free from England and Ameirca, which
tends to swamp the Australian author, he has an-
other serious disadvantage to contend with, i.e.,
there are no great libraries in Melbourne or Sydney,
such as Smith’s and Mudie’s in London. In England,
the orders for popular books given by such institu-
tions largely- help to defray the cost of printing.
Another, but less heavy, stone on the Australian
author’s chest is the surplus stock from London,
which finds its way here. I have seen cloth-
bound novels, the produce of a celebrated London
publisher, and issued originally (pre-war) at 3s.
6d. each, offered by a well-known Sydney bookselling
firm at Is. They were brand new. Bargain catalogues
from Mudie’s and Smith’s usually contain plenty of
such tack (i.e., “new remainders”), including both
fiction and miscellaneous literature. S'o far as the
Federal and the various State Legislatures are con-
cerned, the existence of Australian authors (who
publish here) is recognised -only in two ways, (1)
the Federal Government bags a free copy of each
book for the Parliamentary Library in Melbourne—no
matter in what State it is published ; (2) the State
Government bags another free copy for its Public
Library—both requisitions being precedent to the
granting of copyright in the book. As has already
been pointed out, the Australian writer is practically
the only producer not protected by a duty on the
imported article.

AN ASTOUNDING ACHIEVEMENT.—Experts said it was impossible
for a stock model light American car to even complete such a rim between
Sydney and Melbourne; but ESSEX did it —69 minutes under the record
time, made by a much higher-priced car —averaging over 37 miles per hour.
CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE
IS THE SECRET OF
ESSEX SUCCESS
Since the inception of the ESSEX, four years ago, its record has been one
of constant success. In competition work ESSEX has been the car pre-
dominant in the 4-cylinder field. But even greater than this is the way it
has established itself as a firm favorite with its owners —for all ESSEX
owners are satisfied owners.
Buy an ESSEX and secure the advantages of its ordinary good
qualities that may be found in other cars —PLUS the super-
performance and super-stamina which events have proved are
possessed only by the ESSEX.

What compels admiration in “A Southern
Maid,” at Melbourne Royal, is the produc-
tion—the blending and contrasts of colors
in dresses and background; the grouping
and locating of the figures; in short, the
stage picture. You go away from the per-
formance remembering many pictures, especi-
ally, perhaps, the gaudily-gowned party from
the yacht seated at a long table in Stigant’s
restaurant, whilst the Vendetta party stands
in shadow in the near foreground, at the
side, glowering at Gladys Moncrieff’s in-
credible affection for her new victim. The
music, rather respectable than charming, is
satisfactory; the tall figures and the acting
of Gladys Moncrieff, Clajude Flemming and
Worster, and, in a minor degree, of Chis-
holm (serenader and chief-assistant ven-
“ CINDERELLA ,” AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Champion-jumper James Teddy.
dettist), are highly effective, but thp story
itself has no realistic force. There are great
scenic moments in the romantic opera, but
no moments of striking human interest. The
vendetta cuts no ice in thoughtful estima-
tion. The love affairs are simply stagey.
The comedy relief, tending to bring the
tragic vendetta and its chieftain into open
ridicule, clashes with the opera’s serious in-
terests, so to speak. . The party from the
yacht works automatically (though the best
joke in the show is supplied by an unim-
portant Gussie, who begs the vendetta con-
spirators to maintain their attitudes a jiff
while he takes a snapshot), and the finale
suggests that the librettist, having got him-
self tied up, had to despairingly summon the
comic hotelkeeper to cut him loose. Admir-
able work by Gladys Moncrieff will be most
talked of. In a part that suits her per-
sonality, she acts with sincerity and grace,
while her singing voice on Saturday sounded
nearly smooth as ever at the outset, and
quite as good at the finish. Her enuncia-
tion of words has hardly improved. Gladys
sings for sound mainly, with less regard for
the meaning of the song. Flemming’s suc-
cess is scored in an easier part, whereas
there is some subtle art in Howett-Worster’s
dealing with the vendetta difficulty. Stigant
is pungently funny at first, but the
last act gets him down. Mione Stewart
and Nell Payne do their small bits
neatly, and Purdell, lately from England, is
colorless and nimble in a poor character.
* ¥ * *
“The Flaw,” by Adelaide-girl Doris Eger-
ton Jones, in collaboration with Emelie
Polini, introduced to the world for the first
time on Saturday night at Sydney Criterion,
proved a disappointment, principally because
of the melodramatic loud-pedal which
drowned the natural and human touch with
which Doris Egerton every now and again
played her characters. The idea of the plot,
we are told, was Emelie Polini’s; the build-
ing-up was done by the writing-woman. As
Miss Polini is of the emotional school, she
sees uothing incongruous in the peace of
an Englishman’s ancestral home being
blasted on an average twice every half-hour
by devastating willie-willies of passion—
willie-willies of such fervor that anyone of
them would disrupt an ordinary household
for ever. Again, being a head-liner, Miss
Polini may have forgotten how to judge a
play from out-front; she wants to see the
star in splendid action or hear the star tear
the agony of tense situations into bleeding
ribbons of vibrant notes and fling them into
the front teeth of the gallery girl. On the
other hand, “The Flaw” has the smooth dove-
tailing of sound craftsmanship. Its dia-
logue, though not over-brilliant, is the sort
of conversation that families do hold. Its
situations, though entirely unoriginal, are
gripping, never drawn-out, and end on “slap-
bang” curtains. Although this method of
“bringing down the rag” may be considered
old-fashioned, yet there is no surer way of
nailing an audience to its seat.
* * * *
The story revolves around Richard Craig
(Frank Harvey), an inventor on the verge
of a nervous break-down, and his wife, Lady
Anne (Emelie Polipi). Richard’s nerves
have become so frayed in his tussle with the
elusive little screw that is to make aero-
planing easy that the doctor-friend (Ivay
Souper) warns the titled wife that
any kind of shock or excitement may result
in her husband’s brain running loose for tin
rest of his days. Therefore, when Anne’s
first husband, Pemberton Dacre (Mayne Lin-
ton), whom she, Richard and all her family
friends had believed killed in the war, arrives
on the scene, she consents to give him the
combination of a safe (standing for purposes
of concealment in the front hall), in which
her husband’s aeroplane plans are hidden,
rather than shock Richard by letting him
know that she had made the very natural
war-time mistake of mislaying husband
No. 1. Dacre is murdered, of course,
in the act of getting off with the plans, and
after that the fun lies in guessing who fired
the fatal shot.
* * * #
Frank Harvey, as the nerve-ridden, shaky
inventor carries the play along with his
masterly interpretation of an unlovely part.
His work is a fine piece of observation. Miss
Polini’s work is just as good as it was in
any parts for which Sydney has hitherto
acclaimed her —as awe-inspiring as : a
Rotorua geyser in her emotional outbursts,
and just as uninteresting when out of action.
The difference is that the part of Lady Anne
holds no light and shade. It is a boiling-over
from her first sighful entrance. Kay Souper
as Dr. Cleghorn Lee and Ethel Morrison as
his wife supply acting as soothing to the eye
and ear as velvet pile is to the foot that
has been treading on coir-matting. Mildred
Oottell as Marian Dacre, the lady crook,
manages to etch her three seconds’ worth of
poignant acting into the heart and brain of
the onlooker. The rest of a good cast
includes Nancye Stewart as the French maid,
and Kenneth Brampton as the intelligent
detective who doesn’t know everything, while
Sheila Helpman is that striking anomaly, a
lovable stage child.

The screening in natural colors of “The
Great Adventure,” at Sydney Crystal Palace,
marks a new era in the dicker business, and
there are quite a number of reasons why this
English production should be the best-
patronised film of the week and of some
weeks to come. The subject is of
the romantic days of Charles 11. and
Nell Gwynne. The artistry of Lady
Diana Manners, as the heroine, is going to
increase unemployment among Amurkan
female face-contortionists. The Lyceum
seasons its celluloid offerings with a vaude-
ville act. Charles Ray, in a “boiled-shirt”
drama, and Earle Williams, in a comedy, are
the screen draws; while J. H. Wakefield, of
“The Peep Show,” supplies a musical enter-
tainment. ‘“While Satan Sleeps,” at the
Strand, Jack Holt and Fritzi Brunette
indulge in a jamboree on the tiles; and
although Rudolph Valentino kills uncount-
able bulls a week in. “Blood and Sand” at
the Globe, the price of rumpsteak and
mincemeat is just as high as ever.
* * *
“Dick Whittington,” at Melbourne Palace,
has strengthened the Fullers’ pride in their
conviction that they can’t go wrong with a
panto. The prosperous undertaking has
slackened not at all, thus far. The panto,
takes its pitcher to the well twice every dav
and the well is always running a banker,
which is better than having a banker to
run your well.

“Cairo,” which limits its matinees to
Wednesdays in an ordinary way, has lately
lost the services of Miss Hilliard as Oscar
Asche’s daughter. But the show bears its
anguish without a wince.

Products, at Melbourne Exhibition Building,

At Melbourne Tivoli a programme that
stars Lola and Senia, the dancers, is strong-
est in The Gladiators turn. The two strong
men. with their artistic style and fixings,
would maintain the mighty dignity of the
“turn” to the end if they preserved silence
instead of having something to say to one
another ere they go. Fine feats of muscle
should be left to speak for themselves.
** * *
Clothes make the man in “While Satan
Sleeps,” at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week.
A crook, who breaks from gaol, disguises
himself as a parson, and the effect of the
uniform is to start him on a violent moral
crusade, cleaning up dance-halls and other
wicked places in the gunpowdery Yankee
manner. On the same screen Rudolph Valen-
tino and Mae Murray are pictorially mated
in “The Delicious Little Devil.” The Majes-
tic is screening an impersonally conducted
run round Paris which reveals all that the
good tourist ought to know.
s'; *
At Sydney Tivoli last Saturday English
comedian G. P. Huntley, here again after a
spell of many years, appeared in a sketch
entitled “Selling a Pup.” It is one of those
exasperating turns that rely more upon
mathematical entanglements than unvar-
nished humor; and Sydney looks forward to
seeirv him in a better show. Hector
St. Clair’s catgut scratching is but a sideline
to his quips and patter, much of which is
very delicate. He is easily put up with. And
there are others.

The Adelaide summer has been behaving
very well, on the whole, but big shows keep
away on past experience. So there is a
warm welcome at the re-opened Roval for
Nellie Bramley’s co. in revivals of f.a.q.
plays. The lady has greatly improved in her
art, and “Within the Law” gives her wide
opportunities. Ethel Bashford is the slangy
apprentice to cash-extortion, Fitzherbert the
well-meaning Joe Carson, and Guy Hastings
the boss policeman. The Variety show at
the Majestic has brisked itself ~up with
And ale’s Circus and the baboon comedian,
while at the Prince of Wales’s a juvenile
panto, is promised. In onen-air shows the
competition is keen, Huxham’s Serenaders
on one side of North-terrace now having
Claude Dumpier in opposition on the other.
Adelaide finds there is room for both.
A SOUTHERN MAID.
i n the town of Santiago, where the ballet skirts
are red,
And men and women mostly wear a ’kerchief round
the head ;
Where Coleman paints the orange groves, and dirt
is picturesque,
Ai d the scene when curtain rises has a touch of
Arabesque
(.It’s an Oscar Asche production of the slow siesta
time),
And the farcical ridiculous gets mixed with the
sublime—
In the town of Santiago you will meet a Southern
Maid
Whose dark eyes arc so deadly that she doesn’t
need the blade
Carried always in her bosom when she’s out upon
thp mash,
lor her glances, like her dagger, have a bright and
sudden flash—
In that town of Santiago
Where a Southern Maid will far go
If a lover likes to let her,
Lo! the operatic plot
Introduces a vendetta
Just on purpose to upset her—
A preposterous vendetta
'Gainst a johnnie from a yot.
Well, the johnnie’s Howett-Worster, whilst the
maiden is Moncrieff,
And the silly old vendetta nearly bringeth both to
grief;
Its leader’s name is Flemming, and his other name
is Claude,
A compound of the swaggerer, the ruffian and
fraud.
He means to marry Gladys whom the johnnie came
to woo,
So he chills her to the marrow when he tells
her what to do,
Which is—Kill the British blighter, on her Dad’s
vendetta oath.
But to perpetrate the murder she is naturally loath,
And she hopes to save the bacon of her gilded
foreign friend
M hen the unexpected Stigant brings her trouble
to an end.
Yes, he does; and what is better,
There’s an end to that vendetta,
For they scare the hearty bluffer
Who before had scared the lot;
But this questionable Suffer
For his conduct doesn’t Suffer
When the lady chucks the duffer
For the chappie witli the yot.
“CAIRO," AT HER MAJESTY'S,
MELBOURNE.
Oscar Asdic as the richest merchant on earth,
owning thousands of castles and wives,
and the icily Chinaman who never tells
a lie.
And why she forms a passion
In this operatic fashion,
And why the craven Stigant turns up valiant at
the last,
And whether brother Flemming
Is a “cow” beyond condemning,
Or a man who makes things merry where his Cuban
lot is cast;
And how his scowling set-a
Can-a live without vendetta,
And many another question, which arose and was
forgot,
Will never get an answer
From this wondering romancer;
Enough that Gladys Moncrieff marries Worster and
the yot.

Bernard Shaw writes from England :
The only serious attempt to mob a performance
of my plays during the war was made at Liverpool
by a University professor, who wrote to the papers
and denounced me as a traitor and what not. His
supporters hung banners out over the gallery rail
and so forth. The result was 16 curtain calls
for the performers and the total collapse of the
demonstrators. My meetings were always crowded,
without a note of opposition. I daresay there were
people who were afraid to have me on their plat-
forms or in their theatres; and I gather that this
has been the case in Australia. But as far as
the positive cases were concerned, I might have been
Lloyd George. The truth is, nothing that I have
ever done has put up my stocks as much as the
line I took during the war. I had to get a
printed form of acknowledgment for the resolutions
passed all over the country thanking me for “Com-
monsense about the War.” Everything I said
turned out to be true so rapidly that the Times
and the Morning Post were presently shrieking
what I had been soberly stating. Some of the things
I did were secret service and could not be made
known, but this helped to confuse, and to some
extent to infuriate, my opponents, who could not
make out why I was treated all through by the
authorities as persona grata, and actually invited to
the Front by the Commander-in-Chief!
There is some talk of Shaw’s “Pygmalion,”
a play with the London street-arab of the
female gender as heroine, being produced on
the Australian stage shortly.
“0.K.”: Jean Gerardy, the Belgian ’cel-
list, is nearly due to revisit Australia, after
a lapse of 20 years. The Wizard of the
’Cello, as we called him, is now stated to
have been only in
his teens when last
we saw him, but,
if so, lie was the
most matured
specimen of hand-
some early youth
that memory (can
recall. As a mat-
ter of fact, young
Gerardy made two
trips to Australia,
first when Olive
Kingston was en-
gaged as vocalist
for the recitals,
and next —a year
or so later —when
h e brought a n
operatic soprano
named Alexia Gif-
fard, who was a
fair startler rather
than a striking-
success. None of
Gerardy’s hearers
can have forgotten
the long forelock
that fell over his
eyes as he bent to
the big fiddle, and
the amorous feel-
ing he put into his
Mel. Ward in “The
O'Brien Girl," at
Melbourne Princess's.
thrilling “K6ve d Amour.
“10-2-4”: I went recently to the much-
boomed “Nanook of the North.” One saw
Nanook, an Eskimo hunter, spearing sal-
mon. As each salmon was caught Nanook
buried his teeth in the back of the fish’s
head, and then raised his bloody face with
a wolfish smile. A star item is the harpoon-
ing of a walrus. After the wretched beast
has been dragged ashore Nanook sharpens
his knife significantly and grips the animal’s
throat. “Nanook cannot wait,” explains the
sheet. The engaging creature is next pre-
sented carving bleeding chunks out of the
carcase and pushing the pieces into his
mouth. At the end of the feast he licks the
blood gracefully from either side of his vast
knife. One sees him approaching his traps.
He plunges head-downwards into a hole in
the snow and emerges with a tiny white fox.
Again that horrible grin. The fox is held
up writhing in his murderous hands. At
that stage I am bound to admit I left, hav-
ing had a surfeit of horrors. What I want
to know is why the authorities here ever
passed such an abominable incitement to
brutality. There is only one country that
I can think of in which it is fit to be shown,
and that is the one in which it was filmed.
“Ganesha”: For the worst-written play
since Wilson Barrett I nominate “Cairo.”
sentence in it appears to be an error
of judgment. For stilted phrases, bogus
romance and unconvincing local color it
can hold its own with such stupendous ab-
surdities as “The Sign of the Cross” and
“The Christian King.” Asehe’s Moslems
come out of cheap magazines, and have the
feminist sentiments, not of Baghdad or Cairo,
hut of Maida Vale. And never before have
such Chinese appeared on any stage.
“Cairo” is supposed to be a tragedy, but it
is only a tragedy in the sense that the Gov-
ernment exacts amusement-tax from those
who pay to see the unutterable thing.
“L.E.”: When Hugh J. Ward first came
to Australia with “A Trip to Chinatown”
he had already played about 400 parts, rang-
ing as high as Shakspeare and as low as
nigger-minstrel farce. Once he took 82
parts in 85 weeks —important parts in seri-
ous drama with a company that was quite
first-class. Later he went to London, and for
a characteristic performance at Drury-lane
he received a letter of appreciation from
W. S. Gilbert, who was notoriously hard to
please. Whether Ward will reform the Aus-
tralian theatre or drift with the financial
tide like the rest remains to be seen; but
his record of real work gives him the right
to speak with an authority that few impres-
arios possess.
“Santander”: The trouble with the
“orgy” in “Cairo” at Melbourne Majesty’s
is that about half-an-acre of cuddle is
crowded into a few square feet. As a re-
sult the display of limbs is so swiftly oblit-
erated by the curtain that the connoisseur
hasn’t time to run his eye over the delect-
able details. How much better would the
tableau have been if Asche had strewn the
stairway with half-a-dozen prize nymphs,
picked for their choiceness of contour, and
left the rest of the story to be told with a
rag or two of torn costume, a discarded
goblet, and, perhaps, the smouldering rem-
nant of a torch! The massed revellers in
the present picture are too carefully
arranged, too compact, and—if you must
have it —too neat in their attire, to sug-
gest that they have been through a hot time
on Sardanapalian lines. Moreover, the
idea of them all roosting on a stairway is
too absurd.
“Orb” : But when did Charles Arnold do
the “smalls” (B. 25/l/’23) ? Bendigo, Bal-
larat and Castlemaine, with perhaps a reck-
less dash to Echuca before going back to
the Melbourne Princess’s, was about all L. J.
Lohr or Alec Cowan, who mostly piloted
Arnold, would adventure. Musgrove was a
pioneer. His itinerary with Nellie Stewart,
Harcourt Beatty, and a strong co., included
Balclutha, Hokitika, Blenheim, Greytown,
Dannevirke, Paeroa and Rotorua (M.L.) ;

The profits of the tour I don’t know, though
£5OOO has been mentioned. But the real
bushwhacker is a rare theatrical bird. Dan
Barry was indisputably the king of the Out-
back stage. He played everywhere and paid
everywhere, a unique distinction.
“T.W.”: There’s still much doubt in Aus-
tralian managerial minds whether “The Beg-
gar’s Opera” would get past the chronic
wowseritis of Melbourne and some other
cities, but London is to see “Polly,” Gay’s
other opera,, at the Ivingsway, simultane-
ously with the parent show, which is still
going too strongly to warrant withdrawal.
“Polly” contains 71 contemporary tunes and
snatches of melody, the shortest only four
bars long. Some are too tropical and others
too sentimental for modern presentation, but
50 of the tunes figure in the version pre-
pared by Frederic Austin.
Norbell” also samples Chinese drama :
“F.S.’s” description of a play in China reminds
me. In 1896 I was with the Alfred Danipier co. at
Townsville (Q.), and after we had jerked “Hamlet,”
most of us went to the opposition show, which
happened to be a Chinese production. We approached
the front-of-the-house manager, looking for the
usual “professional courtesy,” but he emphatically
“no sharbeed” deadheads. We urged that we
belonged “allee same Mister Dampier—playum
‘Hamlet,’ j r ou savee?” He remained cold. Then
Tommy Cosgrove had a brain-wave. “We belonga
circus,” he said. That blessed word was the
open sesame, and we were given front seats. The
play was conducted just as “F.S.” describes, and
the male leading lady looked lovely. The orchestra
sat on the floor, along the back of the stage. They
were a mixed lot. Some were dressed in Oriental
finery; some were just dingy vegetable Johns in
slop suits. The property-man strolled on and off
with his props as required, smoking a cigarette.
When a wire-whiskered person committed suicide
props, nonchalantly dragged him off R. by the heels.
A mounted courier also appealed to us. He came
on astride his prancing steed and caracoled all over
the place, his thoroughbred being a length of
clothes-prop. It was a great show. We left about
1 a.m., when they started a new act. A juvenile
lead had just been born, the auspicious event taking
place in full view of the audience, which comprised
a houseful of male Sum Kum Soons only.
“D.”: The obesity of the prima donna is
a familiar convention, but I never heard it
stressed more bitterly than when Mame, the
feminine end of an atrocious Yankee song-
and-patter team, was encountered by Steve,
the complementary half, after a separation,
during which the lady had put on weight.
“Gee, Marne,” he protested, “yew bin booze-
hoistin’, or livin’ on nutrudge, or what?
Doggone it, goil, yew look as if you’d walked
right outer a grand-opera cast!”
“Nero” : When I was a youngster—eheu!
it was in the ’seventies —.Kate Santley,
whose death was reported the other day, was
about the most beautiful and popular
burlesque actress in London. Her photo-
graphs, sandwiched between those' of Maude
Branscombe and handsome H. B. Conway,
were in all the shop-windows. For years she
was the reigning attraction at the Alhambra,
showing in such pieces as “La Belle
MINNIE HOOPER ,
Hugh J. Ward’s
ballet mistress.
Helen” and “The Black Crook” (in which,
by-the-way, Fred Leslie made his first ap-
pearance), and only once was her position
threatened. That was when Rose Bell came
over from Paris and knocked the Cockneys all
of a heap. For weeks the audiences were
divided into Bellites and Santleyites, and the
war didn’t cease until the two actresses
tripped to the footlights and kissed affection-
ately amidst a tempest of applause. In after
years Miss Santley became the proprietress
of the little Royalty Theatre in Dean-street,
Soho; it was said to have been given her
by Sergeant Ballantine, counsel for the
Tiehborne claimant.
“L.H.P.”: Add to “Norbell’s” list of
“O’Brien” pieces (B. 11/l/’23) the two-act
romantic opera. “Shamus O’Brien,” music
by Villiers Stanford, libretto by G. H. Jes-
sop. Produced in 1896 at the London Opera
Comique, it had a capital run, and a tour of
the provinces followed. Jessop’s work was
founded on Sheridan Le Fanu’s poem, and
Stanford drew his inspiration from the melo-
dies and rhythms of his native Ireland. Many
pi’os. have expressed surprise that the tune-
ful “Shamus” has never reached Australia.
“Park Royal”: “Our Boys,” li. J. Byron’s
once-famous farce, was revived in Melbourne
recently by amateurs. It is old-fashioned
now, and its punning humor has grown tire-
some, but in its day it enjoyed a tremendous
vogue. In London it ran for 1362 nights;
there were no matinees then. Kate Bishop,
Marie Lohr’s mother, was the original Violet
Melrose.
“Thor”: It is Australia’s knighted Stoll,
and not the astounding lady who calls her-,
self Madame Lily Payling, who has taken
over Covent Garden on a long lease. But
Stoll has no scheme as rash as Lily’s well-
advertised but unconsummated aspiration of
keeping the grand-opera lamp burning. A
revue. “You’d Be Surprised,” is to take
the boards there, with George Robey as
Caruso’s successor. The title, as least, is
apt.
“Fax”: There is more than meets the eye
in an announcement that the ground off St.
Kilda-road which Wirth Bros, lease from
the Vic. Lands Department is to be re-con-
verted into an amusement park. Round-
abouts, swings and other “Paddy’s market”
attractions are projected, and will serve as
extra “draws” for the skating-rink and
dancing-hall which are always there, and
for the Olympia and Hippodrome which are
only sometimes open, and to one of which
Beaumont Smith is about to bring a show.
The scheme will popularise a deserted thor-
oughfare ; and if the Melbourne climate will
only withdraw its strange animosity to out-
door amusements after sunset, the park in
its -new clothes should flourish exceedingly.
“Lexite”: Bandmaster Fred Haines, who
has been adjudicating at the N. S. Wales
band contests in Sydney, and is to go over
as judge in the forthcoming tests in Maori-
land, is master of the Imperial Military
Band and the Police ditto, the two crack
noise-making bodies of Sydney. He was 15
years with the Life Guards, and an adjudi-
cator at contests all over England ; yet for
years in Australia he missed success. He
reckoned in those days that no musician
could succeed here unless he had a German
name, and freakishly, to test it, applied for
a conductorskip as Fritz Heintz. He got
the job; but before he could explain, the war
came; and when they re-formed "Herr
Heintz” was politely told that there was no-
thing doing.
“Old’un”: Years ago, when the rampings
of Bob Ingersoll were still read, a dramatic
critic wrote enthusiastically that Bignold’s
Mephistopkeles was a tine, jocular, greasy
customer, quite in the lugoldsby manner. The
Scotchman who was then in front of _ the
house for George It. reproached the writer.
.‘‘l don’t think Mr. Itignold will be very
pleased with that notice of yours,” he said
sententiously. "Why . not?” asked the d.c.
"Because,” replied Mac, “you say it’s an
Ingoldsby devil; and that’ll offend all the
religious people. You ought to know as well
as I do that Bob Ingoldsby’s always making
speeches against the Bible!”
“O. P. Hand”: Will Whitburn, a veteran
of the trotting game and a great nigger-
minstrel comedian in his day, was, 30 years
ago, a star at the old Victoria Hall, Bourlte-
street. The night the three Railway Com-
missioners, Speight, Ford and Green, were
suspended—that was in March, 1892 —
Graham, Outtrim and Peacock, three mem-
bers of the Shiels Cabinet, which did the
suspending, sought surcease of strife at the
Vic. Tickled by Whitburn’s fun, Alec Pea-
cock, who was then, as he is now, Min-
ister of Education, grinned boisterously—
so much so that Will came right to the edge
of the stage and begged him not to com-
pete so openly with the “You
may put me out of a job,” added Will.
“F.A.”: Mummers known in Australia
weren’t hard to find abroad during the Big
Fracas. In Piccadilly I met Langford
Kirby, in the uniform of a special cop, and
Hugh Buckler, then a lieut. in a Tommy
formation. At Portsmouth I dropped into
a theatre where a “smalls” co. was playing
“The Kodak Girl.” The principal comedian
was Surrey, of the original cast of “The
Orchid” in Sydney. A month later, in the
Salv’army coffee-stall at Dickebusch (Belg.),
a little one-pipper gave me a “hoy” as 1
moved in out of the rain and. the falling
debris. He was about as high as the counter
and sported pincenez. It was Fred Wright,
whom Australia, knew as Timothy Gibbs in
“Our Miss Gibbs.” He belonged to the
Middlesex regiment. In the winter of 1917
I got a lift in an ambulance along the Albert-
Amiens-road. The driver was Helen Sterling,
one of the imported show girls in “Come
Over Here.”
“The Deacon”: My friend Howler has
just scored the one success of his life. He
was admitted to one of the big hospitals
suffering from an argument with a refrac-
tory kerbstone, when he was—well, n»ot
quite steady. All went well till evening,
when he awoke to double consciousness—
physical first and psychical afterwards. For
the first time he played to a full house, and
had it hanging on his lips, absorbed and
fascinated. The patients, helpless for the
most part, were thrilled with his declama-
tory periods, his passionate impersonation
“ CINDERELLA ,”
AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Gus Bluett
as Capers.
of a murderer. The climax came when he
began to seek the axe from behind the door.
The night-sister by this time was almost as
scared as the patients. (Certainly Howler
had smelt strongly of assorted liquors when
brought in earlier.) When he began to talk
of all evidenee of his crime being concealed
in a neighboring limekiln, the matron
thought it time to acquaint the John on
night duty adjacent, and when the latter
presently reported at the police station that
a raving hospital patient was giving details
of a lately-committed crime, the patrol
turned out. Upon Howler sobering down
next day he was handcuffed. It took him
all his time to convince the sergeant that
he had merely been rendering the piece that
made Henry Irving famous —the murder
scene from “The Bells.”

“The Seething Star” is not for us. “Pioneers” goes
too thinly. .. .V.D. (Manly): Not quite well enough
done. .. .Joseph M.: Begins badly and ends on a
halting line; also the pretended rhyme “seething”-
“weaving” is very evil J.H. (Q.).: Don’t, like
“Flotsam”... .Achel W.: All work published in this
paper is paid for, and what we want is stated in
every issue. We don’t want “A Reverie”.... Kat :
“The Sea of Life” has an original swoosh and
sparkle:—
The Master conceived a soul,
Incased it with strife.
Charged a dynamo from - a live wire.
Then I became a whole,
And a participator in the game of life.
To win merit is my only desire.
Love maelstrom sucked me down with selfishness,
And the froth marred my sight. But for the Master’s
sake,
With fervid hope, and heart all a-quiver,
I blindly struck out till I reached the rapidness 1
That eased my heart that sorely did ache,
For the soul 1 wanted duly to deliver.
E.L.P.: Not much more attractive than the
ragged scrap of paper it is typed on with boot-
blacking... .John B.: “Judgment” hardly in our
line... .1.M.D.: “The White Wife” is a border-line
subject; and as it strained at the metre it fell over
on the wrong side K.R.M.H.: “Adventure”
shouldn’t ride on a trotting draught-horse.... Don
Three: Not quite.... Irene C.: • Nothing in it
R.D.F.: The “Butcher-Bird” doesn’t do it.... Harriet
L.: Too little meat.... F.C.C.F.: In the 557th
attempt try to write naturally... .J.M. (Artlington):
An old, old yarn approached in a tedious way....
J.R.K.: Thin, old idea in poor verse. .. .W.1I.11.:
Terrible. .. .G.G.R.: They don’t ravish our “silken
ears”.... I.C. (Hawthorn) : Absolutely empty....
W.E.8.: “Brindle” doesn’t convince.... Hesperian:
Wooden. . . .C.R.H.: By using 50 words instead of
one you contrive to make a dull story infinitely
dreary.... Mac.: Begins poorly, ends horribly....
H.M. J.: Both miss.... Arbeep: Too slight.;. ..King
li.: The bells don’t ring much of a tune. .. .P.8.P.:
No use just slopping down words. .. .N.H. (South
Brisbane): The lady who tells a man to take up
his swag and walk is hardly likely to say “Go
and seek thy way at dawn”... .S.C.G.: It repeats
what scores of others have written and does it
poorly... .R.A.S.: Not good enough. .. . J.W. (North
Sydney): When eight out of 24 lines consist only
of the words “O cockatoo” it is surely up to the
bird to at least look pleasant...-Maynree: Point
too small. .. .King Bolt: Not enough in it....
R.F.S.: Only great skill could have made that sub-
ject workable; and if you had the great skill you
wouldn’t have bothered.... Kathleen D.: No use....
Athos: Not nearly... .Neville R.: Pretty, but too
slight... .Con C.: No good at a 11... .H.D.8.: The
verse is as mysterious as the 0rb.... Herbert W.:
The arrows are bound to miss if you shoot them
that way... .A.A.D.: Remark that your love sang
last night to the accompaniment of “ocean’s roar”
didn’t thrill us... .May L.: No use here... ,W T .C,
(Tallangatta): Poor stuff without humor....
Carremumbola: Gentle cow-like verse... .H.R.M.: The
“maiden effort” is very tired... .H.E.P.8.: Too
much of it and too many flounders.... Zabut: Not
strong enough for the 10ad... .J.H.N. (Prahran) :
The kind of fooling practised by very young school-
boys ....Bellerive: The “umbrella” lyric has the true
fervor: —
For fresh open-air in
The shade 1 will lie;
From the din of the traffic,
My umbrella and I;
I love the cool breath
Of the soft-fanning breeze.
The flutter and trill of
The birds in the trees ;
I jot down a rhyme in
My small pocket-book.
From the glare of the sun
In a nice shady nook;
When angry clouds gather
And darken the sky.
We wade through the pelter,
My umbrella and I.
. ...W.P. (Mildura): They must have more in them
than that. .. .Jimmy T.: It rattled our teeth out
. ...M.P.S.: “Auto-Suggestion” hasn't enough point
... .Deirdre: “Night on the Express” doesn’t con-
vince. .. .F.G.G., J.J.C. and Rosa R.: Not good
enough.... Gaz.: Wooden verse with words nailed
loosely on to hold it together. .. .E.M.E.: “The
Musician” can’t join the orchestra.... Saaedi: Has
points, but not enough of them... .Patient: Described
rather too often... .Jimmy Trousers: An unexciting
burglar... .Gee Bung: Too loose and rugged... .Sadie
U.: Don’t care for the story; verse very woolly
and tangled... .A.R. (Wellington): The dream idea
spoiled it; but it hadn’t quite the touch for a lie
of that size.... Faillite: That sort of humor is
best left to the “pitchers” P.H.C.: The Gordon
examples are hardly brilliant; and your own lines
voice commonplaces.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.McD.R.: A bit wooden yet; and those solid
blacks look suspiciously like shirking penwork....
E.T.A.: Doesn’t get past... .F.S.: Your energy is
more admirable than your art... .H.A.R.: May use
as suggestion.... 0.F.: Ansemic little thing in blue
ink passed peacefully away L.P.8.: Both duds.
....F.L.D.: Scrapped as per instructions. .. .R.W.M.:
Not a hope.... A.V.G.: Weak joke and horribly stiff
drawing.... H.C.: Holding one for inquest L.C.C.:
Those are not Australian types; and the gag is old.
. ...T.H.: Still below the mark... .8.L.: Terrible.
... .K.A.: Hopelessly blobby... .L.A.: Not worth
space.

Excerpt from the Glasgow llerald,
being a criticism by Sir Robert Bruce,
one of the best-known music critics
in the Old Country:
“Vasa Prihoda, the violinist, has recorded two attractive numbers;
Waltz of Dvorak and Humoreska of Kocian, to piano accompaniment
(Re-Creation No. 80681). These are without doubt the most com-
plete reproductions of violin playing that we have heard, the violin
tone being given out with all its subtleties of quality, while the
accompaniment is admirably balanced with it. We received from
this record all the pleasure of an actual performance.”

DO YOU LOVE GOOD FURNITURE? Then seeing
these nobly distinctive cabinets is a pleasure you
certainly owe yourself. Their old-world grace, their
beautiful workmanship, their purity of design are
exquisite expressions of the best age of furniture-making.
Console arid upright cabinets—there are fourteen of
these models—each one a masterpiece of true and honest
craftsmanship.
DO YOU LOVE GOOD MUSIC? Then you will be
attracted by Mr. Edison’s wonderful art—which has
produced an instrument which sings so perfectly that its
singing cannot be detected from that of living artists.
You may doubt this statement —but you owe it to your-
self to be convinced.
May we have the pleasure?

Jackeroo”: It is reported that two of the
largest cattle-stations in the Maranoa dis-
trict (Q.), Abbieglassie and Maranoa Downs,
are about to stock up with sheep. Verily
the cattle industry is in a bad way, and some
ot the beef barons can’t even raise a saueal
now.
* * * *
“El Verdugo” : I cannot share the simple
faith of “Min Yip,” who (B. 11/l/’23) tells
us that the Japanese are buying expensive
stud sheep in Australia, merely to take to
a land where a poisonous weed will kill
them off. Unfortunately for us, Japan’s
wool-growing industry is to be located, not
m Nippon itself, but in Manchuria, where it
will have ample room.
* * * *
“Stony”: In a discussion on the respec-
tive commercial merits of motor-cars and
horses, old Bill got off the remark which
seems worth recording. “Anyway,” he said,
it s a moral there’s more paid-fer ’orses on
tJi track to-day than paid-fer motors.” It
would be interesting to have the proportion
ot buyers who crash after taking over their
buses on a 10 per cent, deposit.
* * * *
“D.F.”: Another of our great natural
resources developed of late has been the
palm. Round Tuggerah Lake
(N.b.VY.) thousands of them have been cut
down in order to send the leaves to Japan,
where they are used for making mats. No
doubt of the manufactured articles are
imported into Australia. It is lucky that
there is someone to make them for us.
Otherwise we might be driven to do it our-
selves.

' 7 ’t 7- The taxi side-car made its appear-
ance m England some time ago, and Bir-
mingham has now a number of them. They
are natty little vehicles, hooded in much like
a hansom cab, and have been found specially
suitable for men who have to make numer-
ous calls and don’t want to waste time
over it: for the bike and side-car can push
through traffic blocks which hang up the
more lumbering vehicle. And, of course, they
are cheaper; apart from the saving in wear
and tear they can do 50 miles on a gallon of
petrol. Men with service badges drive most
of them.

Randolph Rentless” on automatic lifts:
...” , e , thousands of people who use automatic
lilts daily only a fraction know the essential
principles; and it is no wonder that accidents are
frequent. In Melbourne, recently, a man’s head
was almost severed from his body by an automatic
which started to descend to a lower floor while the
door was still open. Of course, an automatic lift
is theoretically incapable of moving when the door
is open but no machinery is infallible. The best
safeguards against accident are: (1) to see that
the lift is plumb with the floor before any attempt
ib made to alight; and (2) to move in and out
quickly. The man who lingers arguing in the door
of an automatic lift is taking chances.

Uramao”: With the railways in a de-
mo fife ?, nanc, 1 ® 1 mess iri M -L., a statement
It Ut un! e P° llC e court in Auckland sounds
9 u eer. The practice of the Department, it
is learned, has been to destroy all old tar-
!ftW S -t a i ther tlu \ n S ? U them -’ The reason
is that it becomes harder to trace stolen tar-
paulins if others are sold. To suggest that
a font Department might device “ml
method of branding in order that farmers
might buy these useful articles after the
railways have no further use for them would
Ro doubt be regarded as an impertinence.
Everybody knows that for the same reason
horse-breeders never sell any horses—they
shoot them. •’

Borom”: Touching the electric culture of
plants, some tomatoes recently grown near
Uiafton (N.S.W.) are powerful testimony
to the process. ■ One plant, after the’ seeds
had been electrified for only a few minutes
produced four tomatoes whose average weight
Mas ISoz., and whose bulk made broomstick
supports necessary. Moreover, the period
required for the plant to arrive at maturity
was considerably shortened. In the case of
radishes which have been treated, the young
plants have appeared above the ground with-
in _4 hours, and have been ready for eating
m five days. The process is simple, and
consists merely of first moistening the seeds
by immersing them in water for a few hours
and then subjecting them to a current of
t 2 r so from an ordinary coil for
from 20 minutes jto half-an-hour. ‘
m mi n j D Baffin” It is not only butter that
comes down m price as it approaches Mel-
bomme <B 11/1/-23) I haTe to pny „ b “ t
is. od, a lb. for locally-made cheese, which
is sold in Melbourne for 10d. or lid. Bacon
potatoes, wheat, mutton, beef, etc., all pro-
duced locally, are dearer here than when they
are hauled over the 220 miles of rail to the
mty by the Yarra. We have a local butter-
factory. When I asked my grocer why our
butter was dearer here than in Melbourne
( ° r t ! or matter of that, in England) he
explained that he had to pay more. It seems
he, as a director of the butter factory, helps
to fix the local price. Then, as a shareholder,
he votes himself a dividend accordingly The
other local produce he doesn’t mind paving
more for, because the vendors “take it out”
in goods. He gets his profit both ways

“Jackeroo”: Now that rain has fallen in
the Centra! West (Queensland) some won-
derful deals in sheep are being talked about
as showing the fickleness of fortune One
selector took a mob of 1600 ewes from the
Barcoo to the Lower Thomson, and then
in sheer disgust at the dry tracks sold them
to another selector at Is. Od. per head. Rain
fell immediately after, and now those sheep
are worth 30s. a nob. Another chap
reached Longreach with 3000 ewes and
shore them there. He had no chance of
getting any further, so rather than destroy
the wretched animals he gave them awaV
to a selector who carried them on to his
oron n ato i h j Th f roci Pimit can now muster
2500 buckshee sheep, worth close on £4OOO
Another grazing selector gambled on a drop
of ram and bought 7000 ewes at 7s. 6d ner
head. As a bandicoot couldn’t get a decent
feed on Ins selection, he turned his purchases

late years are showing an increasing tend-
ency to become forgotten, whereas some of
those who have failed in the competition
have done conspicuously good work. Two
« St A? C ? S are the late Hu « h Ramsay
and WV B Mclnnes. Both failed miserably
to catch the judge’s eye, yet Ramsav entered
a * gr f a , t career, and Mclnnes has collared
the Archibald prize two years in succession.
Mr. Ocky”: Harry Shugg, the youthful
genius who leads the Malvern (Vic.) Tram-
ways Land and for whom a world tour is
planned, first used the baton at Geelong,
where he lilted the Harbor Trust Band from
obscurity to the championship at Ballarat.
Before that he had assisted the St. Augus-
tine s Orphanage (Geelong) Band in its
Ballarat triumphs. Percy Jones, a mere
boy, was then the conductor, and his brilliant
successor, Leslie Hoffman, a playing mem-
ber These three comparative youngsters
all have remarkable records. Hoffman has
won the big championship at Ballarat with
Augustine s lads, Jones has done it with
st - Augustine’s and the Geelong Municipal,
and ohugg with the Geelong Harbor Trust
as well as the Malvern Tramways bands.
Rill Rowyang ’: Passed out at Proserpine
(N.Q.) the other day, Charles Beveridge
Waite, aged 72. He. arrived from England
m early <, sixties, and settled on Cadaga
and Coondara stations. Later he bought
land on the Proserpine River, and estab-
lished Crystal Brook station. When Toll
was murdered by the blacks at the Goose
Lagoons. Waite followed the murderers over
then unknown country and captured them •
and when C. Bradley, of Mount Dryander,
was lost in the bush and collared by'blacks’
Waite chased them to the mouth of the Pro-
serpine River, and as the niggers were about
to escape in canoes he persuaded them to
release their captive. Few pioneers knew
Binghi better. Billy Waite took his name
from the deceased, who befriended the half-
caste buckjump riding champion from bov-
hood.
Mrs. Andrew Glencross, who failed in her
attempt to enter the Reps., for Herity
(vie.), has somewhat downheartedly stated
her intention of abandoning politics' for the
future, except as a general supporter of
True-bluism. Yet there should be room in
Parliament for a woman with (1) sufficient
ability to arrange a sd. milk-supply for Mel-
bourne house-wives, without sweating the
consumer, while the Milk Ring steadfastly
kept its retail price at 7c1.; (2) enough per-
sonality to incur the active dislike of Billy
Hughes, both before and after he jumped
into the anti-Labor pastures, which he has
found so succulent; and (3) such a plat-
form manner and vocabulary as to make a
double name for herself in politics-4she
having been, as Eleanor Cameron, the Best-
known Liberal lady-battler of her day.
“Iford”: A par. (B. 11/l/’23) notes that
Fremantle and Kalgoorlie have both‘ sent
\ ictorian-born lawmakers to the Hons# y»f
R r G )S - But why single William Watson and
lexas Green out for notice of origin?
Gregory (Swan) is certainly another Vic-
torian product, and so, I believe, is Maim
(Perth). W.A.’s fifth Rep., Provvse (For-
rest), is a New South Welshman, ' in fact
there isn’t a real Groper* in
Westralia’s whole contribution of 11 to the
Federal Parliament, excepting onlv Senator
Drake-Brockman. who came to light at
Busselton some 40 years ago. As for the
House of Reps., the only native-born West
Australians who were ever returned to that
were a couple of the ground-floor contribu-
tions. Elias Solomon, who sat one term for
Fremantle, and Bigjohn Forrest. And
Drake-Brockman is so far the onlv Senator
who sprang, in a manner of speaking, from
the soil that he represents. Possibly W.A.
would have fewer grievances against the
Commonwealth than it parades to-day if it
hadn't so consistently relied on dutlanders to
express its views.

Be a Rexona Girl!
It Means Health and Beauty.
MISS MADGE ELLIOTT,
-a Beautiful Rexona Gi rl -
Rexona Girls are more numerous every
day, and one of the most charming is Miss
Madge Elliott, of the J. C. Williamson Co.,
Ltd. Miss Elliott uses only Rexona Soap
for her Skin and Hair.
She writes us as follows: —
“Add me to your Rexona Club,
please. If anyone deserves election
i do, for I use nothing but Rexona
Soap for my bath, my complexion
and my hair. If I knock myself in
hurrying on or off the stage, or get
a little stiff, I use Rexona. It is
worth its weight in gold in one’s
medicine chest. Please notify me
when elected.”
Rexona Soap Gives Natural
Beauty to Skin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair, which cannot he imitated, can be obtained
by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not assert
this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such Soaps can only cleanse; they
cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing,
healing, antiseptic balsams as Rexona,
the Rapid Healer, the value of which in
the treatment of skin affections is known
throughout the world. Simply use Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or
twice a day, and see if it does not quickly
soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen the
tendency to pimples, and leave the com-
plexion clear, fresh and velvety.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DEATH, on a life that’s nearly run,
His warning shade is flinging,
But, walking sadly in the sun,
I heard a blackbird singing,
And like a dream my trouble passed,
And I, a lad, was going
Lightfoot o’er hillsides tender grassed
And sweet with clover blowing.
Christ, but how clear each well-known tone
Rang out! Each trill and quiver!
I caught the tender fragrance blown
From white thorns o’er the river,
I heard the rustle of the grass,
Green leaf to leaf replying;
And the wind rushing up. the pass
And down the valley dying.
The very breath of vanished youth
Stirred my old heart to sorrow
Till I was sick with love and ruth.
What signifies to-morrow
When life is bitter on my lips,
And all my soul is aching
To see o’er grassy swells and dips
Those clear May mornings breaking t
And Norah Whiles my heart’s been sore
When, o’er two oceans ringing,
I’ve seemed to catch your voice, asthore,
Sweet as a blackbird’s singing;
’Tis round me now and draws me on .
Soft sigh ! Long-silenced laughter .
Who would have thought when you were gone
That I’d live so long after !
And what are Heaven and .Hell, at all?
Grim seed of careless sowing.
’Tis davs gone by that I recall
When, barefoot, I’d be going,
A happy lad, to meet my love
These are the Heaven I m craving ,
If it be sin, then God above
Knows I am long past saving;
VICTORIA.

The Voice.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE afternoon, about two years after
her marriage, Mary Gaunt was over-
come by unreasoning panic.
She was sitting on the verandah after-
three hours spent m transcribing the short
hand script that her husband had written the
night before. As she looked lazily at
thp water of the Cove throwing into hard
relief every brilliant detail of the flame-trees
below, she tried to tell herself that her fears
were foolish. The candid serenity of the
scene before her seemed to deny b>
solid reality the mere possibility ot any-
thing dreadful. She tried to shake olt hei
feeling by thinking about Johns novel. H_ s
work as a journalist had given lnm a wide
experience of police courts, and this had
helped to intensify his long-standing interest
in obscure criminal types, and m the quee
twists of evil minds. His library consisted
largely of books on abnormal psychology, on
criminology and on the history of the eaily
convict days. His novel was a presentation
of the spiritual degradation of a convict
“sent out” for some mean crime in an Eng-
lish slum, and as day by day she had copied
Ins work she had begun herseli to experience
a fascinated interest in this horrible dissec-
tion of evil. . „
But it was only this afternoon that a
hundred disquieting little things had sprung
into her mind. It seemed that in some man-
ner John had been changing as he progressed
with the story. He wrote every night m his
study—alone, for he could not bear interrup-
tion. In the beginning he had joined her
after an hour or so. But as he became more
and more engrossed he gave up this practice.
He kept coming home earlier and earlier,
and could scarcely wait to finish dinner before
hurrying away to his writing. fehe realised
with a shiver that thinking about the book
did not remove her sense of fear. The book
was bound up with her fear. Besides, that
fear was not for herself; it was for him.
She thought of the weariness that was evi-
dent in his every movement, of his morose
thoughtfulness, of the many little signs, of
strain, to which she could not help but give
a disturbing significance. .
She told herself, again and again, that she
was foolish, that there was nothing to fear,
that the book would soon be finished. xet
somehow she remained unconvinced.
John Gaunt, stepping , on the grass as he
came round the house, did not note the trouble
in her eyes. He saw only the loosely-bunched
mass of bronze-colored hair, the delicate skin
on her hands and face, and the dark beauty
of her eyes. But the adored sight did not
banish his own air of tense restraint.
“Let’s have dinner soon, dear, he said.
“I want to get on with the book.” ,
“Why not take a rest to-night? You re
overdoing it.”
“I’m not. And, anyhow, I can t help it.
You don’t understand. I can’t get the in-
fernal thing out of my-head.”
“Try, John. It’s unhealthy. Try.
“Don’t say any more just now, Mary,” he
interrupted. “Give me a few more nights
and I swear I’ll let up. I feel I will be
able to then.”
With a sigh she led the way inside. _
Throughout the meal she tried to interest
him, and" he tried to be interested. But he
could not. It was a relief to both when he
rose and left the table. And yet she saw
him go out with a trepidation she could not
restrain, a trepidation which increased as the
twilight faded, and the night hours passed.
The silence of the little house oppressed her
horribly. She was frightened, and she did
not know what she feared.

almost of inertia, but for the vivid depth of
his eyes His interests were remarkably
diverse. lie was a chess-player of ability, and
something of an expert in pawn endings; he
had followed the development of the heavier-
than-air flving machine from the experiments
of the ear.lv pioneers to the latest wireless-
controlled 'Fokker ’planes; he could amuse
himself with a piano: he had made a
thorough study of the Mathematical Theory
of Probability, and had even spent some
months in consulting the files of old news-
papers in an endeavor to apply the principles
of mathematics to the problem of winning on
racecourses, though he had never been to a
race meeting in his life. In short, he was
possessed of that restless curiosity which is
associated rather with youth than with
middle age. He would suddenly decide to
explore some new thing, and would at once
do so with terrifying thoroughness and in-
tensity. In this way he had become attracted
to the investigation of those dangerous secrets
which enshroud the fate of Man, when he has
passed from his mysterious early habita-
tion to one yet more mysterious.
Small powers of divination were required
to tell hill now that Mary Gaunt was in
grave trouble.
“What is it?” he asked. “Anything
wrong with John?”
“Oh, Doctor, I’m terribly afraid. Some-
thing is happening to him. I have seen —
and heard things Oh ! help me, only you
can help me.”
“Tell me about it. Sit down.” . .
“Last night,” she said, “he started writing
very early. He told me not to wait up
for him.' About 10 o’clock I left the work
I had been doing to go to bed, and as I
passed his room I heard a voice in it. 1
stopped to listen. The maid had gone out
for the evening, and there was no one but
ourselves in the house. I waited in the
hall, my heart throbbing, throbbing. The
Voice came low, insistent, continuous. It
was like a sick moaning of hurried words.
I could not hear what it said, but it seemed
to me to go on softly, and without a break.
I cannot say how hideously unnatural it
was.... The nausea that came over me .arose,
perhaps, out of my fears; but, oh, Doctor, I
cannot help feeling even now that the sound
was vicious, disgusting in itself. I don’t
know how I managed to nerve myself to it,
but I felt that I simply had to open the
door, and see for myself, and I did. John
was sitting, writing at his table. You know
he only uses a desk-light, and the room was
dim. I could not see at first. Oh, how can
I tell you? How can I tell you?”
The doctor’s hand, gentle and soothing,
held one of her arms. “Go on,” he said.
“John was sitting at his table, writing at
a terrific rate. I looked at his face. It
was drawn, terribly drawn. His mouth was
open, his lips were sagging, his eyes were
heavy, his cheeks deathly pale. I have never
seen him look like it before. I have never
seen anyone look like it. He did not hear
me. Without thinking I moved over to
him and put my hand on his shoulder. At
that moment I saw a man standing beside
him, on his right, opposite me. Somehow
I was so terrified that I did not notice that
the voice was still to be heard. It had not
stopped all the time. I remember thinking
first that John should introduce his visitor
to me—a silly thing to come into my head just
then, but I had a feeling right at the back
in my mind that I must cling to something
ordinary and simple. Then I noticed the
peculiar dress the man wore. I thought,
when I realised that he had on a scarlet
jacket with brass buttons, that he was in
masquerade. He was dressed like a soldier
in the pictures of the early days. His
hair was cut peculiarly, so that it came
down before his ears, and he had a beard.
He was leaning towards John, murmuring
quickly into his ear, and John seemed to
be writing dowm what he heard. All this
I noticed in the first few seconds. I could
hear the words plainly now —strange words
they were: English, but an unfamiliar Eng-
lish. But I did not have time to think. I
did not take in the words. I looked at the
man; I saw the frightful expression of
malevolence on his face, his wicked mouth
and cruel eyes—and then I must have
moved slightly, for I saw him sideways, and
I saw that he had no back. He was only a
shell —a mask. In front the thing looked
like a man : I could see plainly that it was
like the model of a man—a hollow model
with only a front. Inside_ the shell where
there should have been his body and his
head there was nothing. It was only a living
mask. And it was talking, talking quickly,
monotonously. I screamed “John! ’ and cov-
ered my eyes with my hands.
“And then it was just as if nothing had
happened. The thing disappeared in a tiny-
instant. One moment I was looking at it,
the next I was looking at the bookcase. John
put down his pen and turned to me. He
seemed tired, and that was all. His face
had lost its looseness. It was firm and
clear. He appeared bewildered to find me there.
“‘I didn’t hear you come in. child,’ be
said. I could only say ‘Oh, John!’ and
almost fell, but he stood up quickly and
held me. The touch of his arms brought me
to myself, made me realise that I was in the
familiar, everyday world I knew, and that
there was nothing to be feared. He put
aside his work, and came upstairs with me.
He could not understand what was the
matter, and I did not tell him. I feljj that
I had been mistaken, that I had had a hor-
rible vision. But. oh, Doctor, I have not
been able to throw off the feeling that I made
no mistake. Tell me, did I dream it all?
Did I really hear the voice and see the
creature? Or is my brain going?”
“Now, now, child, this won’t do,” the doc-
tor said ouietly. “You must not get foolish
ideas into your head. Normal people have
hallucinations far oftener than the world
thinks. Besides,” he added softly, almost
to himself, “who knows? It may be —I have
seen stranger things. Mary, my dear, invite
me to dinner to-night, and I may be able to
help you.” . .
“Oh, Doctor, it is good of you. And you
don’t think me quite mad?”
“Of course I don’t. Now, run along and
stop worrying. Your fears are baseless.”
But when she had gone he remained for a
time, looking straight ahead, and seeing
nothing. At last he rose.
“I wonder Is it possible?” he said to
himself.
They talked of anything but the book dur-
ing dinner, and John seemed brighter under
the influence of the strange little doctor’s
banter than he had been for weeks. But he
would not wait to smoke or have his coffee.
He left Mary to entertain their friend with
excuses which the latter cut short,
“Go away,” he said; “I don’t want to nip
a work.of genius in the bud.”

LOSS OF HAND SAVED.
Writing from 46 East Street, Valley, Brisbane, Mrs.
. ■ E ‘ Kuskopf says‘Whilst working in Sydney my
husband got one of his hands fast in some machinery
and the top of a finger was torn right off. After hospital
treatment, the wound apparently healed, but only to break
out again soon after. Blood-poison soon developed, and the
whole hand was terribly discolored and inflamed, whilst the
finger kept on discharging matter. We dreaded amputation, yet
f™ med una voidable until we began to use Zam-Buk V J
The Zam-Buk treatment proved wonderfully effective and trradu..
ally all poisonous matter and discoloration was drawn away, and the
inflammation completely subdued. As my husband had been off work
seven weeks, you can imagine our gratitude to Zam-Buk for its wonderful
healing. Ultimately it effected a perfect cure.” r

tiouble exists, in preference to ordinary soaps.

Buk Medicinal Soap will be found most sooth-
ing, and is an invaluable “aid” to the Zam-Buk
treatment. 1/- per tablet of all Chemists, or

h or a couple of hours Mary and the doctor
taiired. He exerted himself to take her
thoughts from the apprehension which he
Knew to be creeping over her. Suddenly he
leaiised that she was listening for some-
thing. She was paying no attention to
linn, but was straining her ears to catch a
voice that she shrank from hearing, a voice
that would hurt her, but which she must
hear, if it was to be heard.
on lightly, but he was speaking
with his lips only. The darkness had iso-
lated the little house and its three occupants,
it seemed almost tangible, as though some
Visibie black wall had shut them off from the
rest of humankind.
He decided suddenly what to do.
_ Let ** S° to him,” he said. She rose at
once. They walked softly along the dim hall,
lit only by a low electric globe until they came
to John s door. They stood there together, the
octor s hand on the girl’s arm, listening.
1 hey must have been like that, silent, im-
movable for quite two minutes. Then he
heard the voice. He pressed her arm
n- j she ■ looked at him he nodded
ms head, with a grave confident half-
smile, to show that he had heard and was
not afraid. The voice came whining through
the door, sickening, inhuman, cruel. Its sound
was a concentration of passionate evil, the
essence of everything bestial and lewd. It
came in a series of waves, like some foul
enveloping fluid. The doctor felt the girl
shiver slightly She was icy cold. He had
to steel himself against the nausea that the
noise produced in him.
With a sudden, decisive movement he re-
leased her arm, grasped the handle of the
door and flung it open. The volume of sound
Irom the room increased as the obstructing
wood swung away, and they found themselves
staring, horrified, into the room.
An enormous figure of a man, well over
S^ X iJ 11 ? 11 : stood against the table. He
vaa clothed m the brilliant uniform of an
18th-century soldier. He seemed to be look-
up® straight at the man and the woman in
the doorway, but the doctor felt that he did
not see them. His voice kept sweeping to-
wards them; they could see his mouth
moving horribly; his bearded face had an ex-
pression of awful concentration, as though
he were straining violently at something.
Suddenly the doctor realised that this figure
was growing. It was filling out. the contour
was becoming firmer, the tenuous hands more
solid. The doctor’s glance shot from the
other to John. Mary must have looked at
him at the same moment.
Doctor! she screamed. “He’s shrivelling
U vP‘ ' i-\ and , a scarcely perceptible sigh
she slid to the carpet. The doctor stumbled
into the room, one thought alone hammering
in his brain. Almost automatically, he
touched the switch and the room was flooded
with a clear white light.
'. Doctor Page flicked the ash from his
cigar, bo absorbed were the three men who
had been listening to him that they moved
forward with a common impulse to do the
same. The doctor continued his story.
-A-t the very moment that she screamed,
the pen dropped from Gaunt’s emaciated
fingers, no longer strong enough to hold it,
though they twitched slightly as though still
in the act of writing. True enough, the man
was visibly shrinking, as the figure of the
soldier grew. His eyelids fell loosely half
over his eyes, in which the dim spirit of life
scaicely dickered; his body was already
too small for his clothes; his face was
strangely hollowed, and his lips had become
two narrow scarlet bands. He was fragile
umecognisable. . . . ITrom his ear there
ran a horrid thick grey thread into the body
of the soldier. It was flaccid and puisat-
mg. ihe apparition was drawing the very
stuff of life from the unfortunate man at the
table; it was sucking from him a visible
and tangible form to body forth its evil
stran 8e thing was, too, that
the Voice continued to issue uncannily from
its lips. But if was the thread that gave
me the truth. I realised that it was an
uncommon sort of materialisation. I
thought of the light—Gaunt worked always
in a reddish light, as I told you—and as
soon as the idea of a materialisation took
hold of me I knew what to do. No material-
ised form can exist in a white light. To
speak frankly, I don’t know how I got to it
but I stumbled to the switch, turned on the
light and knew that he was saved. It was
a very slow dematerialisation—the material-
isation had progressed to an amazing
extent. I suppose it took quite three
minutes. The throbbing of the cord stopped
as the light sprang up, then it reversed its
direction, and I saw a look of mad frus-
trated terror come over the face of the
gigantic figure, as it slowly pulsed back to the
body of its companion. It was a weird
spectacle. At one moment Gaunt was being
sapped of his life to build up a ghastly mon-
strosity ; in the next he was looking at me
with weary but quite normal eyes, and ask-
ing what on earth I meant by interrupting
him. Then he saw his wife on the floor
ne f.r tae oor ’ turned to pick her up.
It was a queer affair altogether. Very
queer. Genuine materialisations under the
most favorable circumstances are extremely
rare. There are probably not more than
three or four genuine ‘mediums’ alive to-
day who can produce them. John Gaunt is
one. Clearly he had become so com-
pletely absorbed in his man—a convict, who
on his release, joined the army—and had so
thoroughly steeped himself in the period of
which he was writing, that his whole being
was thrown into the task of projecting the
man as he imagined him. I haven’t the
faintest idea of the process by which the
materialisation takes place, though as you
may know I have given a great deal of time
to the study of such phenomena. I can only
express it by saying that his impulse to
realise the criminal as thoroughly as if he
had been a living man was so overwhelmingly
powerful that it used the mysterious mech-
anism of the materialising power to embody
him. Gaunt can be said to have actually
brought his fiction to life—very nearly at
the cost of his own In some way, the
thing must have had a rudimentary sort of
consciousness, of g very low but powerful
a fl such discarnate beings, it
would have been endowed with a horrible
tenacity in its search for expression in bodily

Man Overboard.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE were hove-to off Cape Leeuwin in
a howling gale, and had passed
a bad night dodging the green
seas that surged over our bows, sweeping
the ship’s deck-furniture against a break of
the poop with generally a few of us mixed
with it.
The starboard watch was making its way
cautiously, between seas, to the galley, just
about daybreak, for a drink of something
“wet and warm.” Our black “doctor” called
it “kawffee.” Suddenly from aloft came a
scream of “Man overboard !”
It came from little Sweeney, who had
gone upstairs to secure a bit of the mizzen
to’gal’n’s’l that had blown adrift from the
gasket during the night. We looked aloft
and saw him standing on the yard gesticu-
lating excitedly and pointing at some object
away astern.
The “old man” was below quietly balling
off his arrears of sleep, but the second mate,
a peppery little Welshman named Thomas,
who had, from the mizzen rigging, caught a
glimpse through his glasses of the figure
of a man with arm upraised against a cloud
of albatrosses, as he rose on the crest of
a huge wave, yelled to the watch : “Volun-
teers for the lifeboat, lay aft! Hurry up,
me lads, or the bloody birds will have the
eyes out of him.”
There was a rush for the boat. Of course,
as usual on a ship carrying no passengers,
we had no boat-davits shipped, but carried
the boats lashed, keel uppermost, to the skids
on the main deck. But little Thomas was
equal to the emergency. Bending the to’gal-
lant halliards on to the bow, and the stay-
sail halliards to the stern of the lifeboat, he
and his crew had it swung over the side
and away before we had time to inquire the
name of the man in the water.
The noise over his head had at length
aroused the “old man”—a big, dour Scot
from Aberdeen, The mate, who had been
called to relieve the second mate, bumped
against him on the companion-ladder.
“Just coming to call you, sir,” he splut-
tered breathlessly. “Man overboard —life-
boat with four hands—-second mate in charge
—gone to pick him up.”
“How did it happen, and who is over-
board?” asked the skipper calmly.
“Don’t know yet, sir,” replied the mate. “No
time to inquire, but the poor devil is having
a bad time with the birds, whoever he is.”
The old man glared aloft at the men
perched in the mizzen rigging who were
shouting excitedly as they watched for their
mates in the boat to heave into sight on the
crest of the waves.
“Come down all except one hand to watch
the boat!” he shouted. Then, turning to the
mate, “Muster the hands and find out who
is missing,”
Ehe men were already “standing by” at
the break o the poop, and the mate, after
calling the roll, turned to the skipper with
a puzzled expression, and exclaimed: “All
hands accounted for, sir. The man out
there must have fallen from the steamer that
passed us last night.”
The old man’s forcible opinion of this
solution of the mystery was interrupted by
a hail from aloft: "On deck there! They’ve
picked him up, sir!”
Half-an-hour later, the gale having mod-
erated, the Highland Chief manoeuvred close
to windward of the boat, which approached
slowly in the “smooth” made by the oil-bags
hung over her bows. As soon as the boat
was within hailing distance, the old man
roared through his trumpet: “Is he alive?”
Faintly against the wind came the reply
from the second mate : “No, sir.”
“What the devil does he mean, then, by
cringing a corpse aboard?” growled the old
man. Then, turning to the mate, he added:
"Pass the word along for the sail-maker to
get out some old canvas and scrap-iron. We
g ! ye le h°°r chap a decent burial.”
Ihe boat was soon alongside where a tackle
had been rove to hoist the body aboard. The
second mate and two of his crew shinned up
the Jacob’s ladder, leaving two hands in
the boat to fend her off and hook the falls
for hoisting.
The mate, leaning over the side, stared
hard at something wrapped in a sail that
lay across the thwarts. He shifted his gaze
to the men’s faces, and then turned to the
little Welshman. “What’s the joke?” he in-
quired sharply. “What are you all looking
so-—- pleased about?”
“It’s the chief we’ve picked up,” the other
whispered as the skipper descended the poop-
ladder and came towards them with the red
ensign in one hand, and an ancient prayer-
book in the other. The little group awaiting
him noticed that he had shipped his black
go-ashore hard-hitter and tail-coat for the
ceremony. Just then the corpse was swayed*
unboard from the boat and dropped with a
most irreverent bump upon the deck.
The second mate swore fiercely at the men
who had let it go. “What are you doing,
you d—d fools, are you trying to break his
sword arm?”
. "Eh, what’s this?” cried the skipper, peer-
thing the men were uncovering.
"It’s the old chief,” replied the second
mate. “Must have got pounded off by the
heavy seas we took aboard last night.”
The old man gazed indignantly at the ship-
builder’s idea of a Highland Chief in full
regalia, and then turned wrathfully to the
little Welshman. “And you risk a good boat
and four men’s lives for a joke like this!” he
cried. “Man, I’ll log ye for it!”
But the mate intervened. “Not much joke
about it. sir. I thought it was a man, and
so would you if you had seen it floating on
its back with its arm up, and I doubt' if Mr.
Williams saw any joke when he found he
had been chasing a wooden image.”
"Ah, weel,” replied the skipper, his anger
softened by the reflection that a new figure-
head would have cost him a heap of siller.
“Tell the carpenter to fix him up again as
soon as possible; we’ll hae no luck till the
old chief is pointing our course again.”
