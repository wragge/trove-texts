Libel law.
Although (he ruling of Judge Innfs in the
ease of “the money-lending messenger”
against the Herald is a welcome evidence
of His Honor’s eon ver-
siou to a system more
in harmony with Bri-
tish justice lhau had
heretofore been ap-
proved by himself and
bis brother Judges, its
immediate effect is
simply to make the
law of libel iu this
country more uncer-
tain lhau ever. His
Honor distinctly re-
versed bis owu ru iug
iu the case of Ander-
son versus Fairfax.
This reversal was, we
consider, very much iu
lavourof public inti r-
ests. But if successive
judgments or dine-
iions can be eoutra-
dictory on two occa-
sions, they can cmi-
tiuue to be contradic-
tory. No oue cau be
sure that the next lime
the law of libel is laid
down by oue of our
Judges, there will not
lie a return to the
system which Judge
Innes so unexpectedly
abandoned. The “glo-
rious uncertainty of
the law ” has been sub-
stituted for distinctly
bad law, and that is all
that has been gained,
bet us see how it
stands now. la The
Bulletin of June 30,
*83> we mentioned that
‘ iu the (Jlontaif-BuL-
tfixiN case, it was ex-
pressly uiged by the
pountgi f or the pro-
prietors of Cioutarf
that me whole leiior
of a journal and any
part of the contents
of any of its numbers,
present or past, might
Be taken into consi-
deration as affording
a test by which to

cular article. The pre-
Sir VVil-
Liam Manning, was at

*llK the Chief Jusdce
before giving a ruling

lor tiHed by consnlta-
u °h with Sir Jam s
Martin, he ruled Unit

Perilous of the paper
w 88 admissible, as
light upon
e spirit in wbi, ti it was conducted. This
Panels as a precedent; or, rather, it so stood
t'd the other day. but Sir George Innes
Inst as explicitly jultd to tlie contrary in
* s addre.-s to the jury in the Anderson
tase * Ri* Honor s owu words, as reported,
are:—
I must tell you th„t you must not go by
liberal character ot the paper. What you
have to consider is the character of this particular
article. And, on the other hand, if a paper were
to be charged with libel, and come article were
given in evidence as a proof of that charge, the
article itstif not being libeilour, then though it be
hrouuht against them that they a>-e constantly pub-
lishir g libels, and that the general evidence is that
the paper is a scurrilous proiuction, that cannot
be any proof that that particular article was libel-
lous. So, in this matter, the evidence that this
paper is generally conducted on the most cautious
lines possible in no way entitles them to immunity
when they do—by whatever moans it miy come
about-publish a defamatory article.”
These comparisons were induced by the
rulings iu the case of Anderson versus
Fairfax. Oh the same occasion. Sir George
Innes instructed the jury as follows
“The question is. Are these statements true?
Are these unhappy hoys the means of Retainer a
Rood Income from the public «nd Ri vinR Anderson
a certain hold upon ft valuable property—thus
attributing to him dishon°st motives —and were
the boys worked for long houn daily at The
severest manual toil, underfed, ordinary educa-
tion and religious teaching alike neglected, and
enjoying none of the pi iy or amu ement necessary
at their age? Nov, are these things true or not ?
Are they made out to your satisfaction ?”
Ami again : —
“If this artiel? had contented itself with saying
things of that kind, pointing out these matters
which you may take to have been oro\ ed, and if
these fac's, having been proved, (here had been
the strongest, the most trenchant, the most severe
comment and criticism upon the way in which this
institution was conducted, i. obody could have
found any fault with it. it would have been the
right unquestionably, and perhaps it would have
been the duty, of a journal such as this to point
these things out. But what is complained of here?
Mr. Owen says he does not object to general ob-
servations. What he says is: ‘ They have charged
us here with various things to which I have ad-
verted Lucre in detail. We say they are untrue;
we say (hey are eminently calculate! to do us
injury.’ ”
With reference to which the Judge went on
to remark:—
“That is the way the plaintiff presents his case,
and it is for you to say whether these charges are
proved. Some of them may have been proved, and,
as I paid before, the thing Ins been subjected—and
justly—to very strong animadversion and con-
demnation on many points. But it is for you to
say whether these things are proved, and if they
are not preyed, then the plaintiff is entitled to a
verdict at your hands*
with such damages a%
under all the circum-
stances of the ci s*, you
may think juslititble.”
And, once more re-
ferring to the different
charges:—
“If you think they ha\ e
not been substantiated, if
you think one or more if
them are of sufficient im-
portance to be taken into
consideration as serious
charges, then the plain-
tiffs are entitled to a ver-
dict with such damages as
you may think proper.”
it is true that Sir
George Innes subse-
quently, in conse-
quence of cj'nmeiits
made by the Press,
denied that these ex-
pressions had cor-
rectly louveyed his
meaning. Even then
he seems to have beeu
disposed to “come
round.” His Honor
remarked: —
“ I did not tell the jury
that the article must be
shown to bo true ‘in
every particular,’ but
that all the statements
declared on, which in
their opinion had not
been proved and con-
veyed serious defamatory
charges, must be proved
to be true in order to en-
title the defendants to a
verdict.”
It is clear, however,
from the forgoing quo-
tations, that His Ho-
nor did instruct the
jury iu the sense he
denied ; and his sum-
ming iu this recent
ease proves that his
dispositions were cer-
tainly shifting. His
summing on this occa-
sion is precisely in the
spirit which 1 he Bul-
letin blamed him in
tire earlier case for not
adopting. That is to
say, it is in accord
with the Bins laid
down by the Lord
Chief Justice of Eng-
land, and which Sir
James Martin round-
ly repudiated. Sir
James, it will be re-
membered, expressed
himself veiy super-
ciliously respecting
the legal acumen of
the Lord Chief Jus-
tice, and didn’t think
much of his decisions. Sir George Innes
seemed to have, in his earlier summings,
heei; considerably influenced by l-'e views
of the Chief Justice. His recent conversion
is apparently an exercise of independent
judgment, which may involve a reversal of
his ruling the Hrst time Sir James Martin
presides at a libel trial. We place beside
each other passages from Sir George's latest
summing and from an article in The Bulue>*

'Tin commenting on the contrary ruling in
Anderson’s ease in 1883: —
Thk Bulletin, June,
188S.
“ It is at least quite un-
disputed that His Honor,
whatever he may have
meant to leave unsaid,
did not at any period of
his summing Instruct
thejurythat they should
take a broad view of the
representations in the
article, weigh and con-
sider the general pur-
port, and the ultimate
effect from the stand-
point as claimed by the
defendants, and not de-
nied to them, of public
benefit. Sir George as-
suredly did not instruct
the jury that they were
not to split straws and
grope among technicali-
ties and petty details,
but to decide whether,
viewing all the matters
comprehensively and in
their mutual inter-rela-
tions, the article had
done the State good ser-
vice j or that the In-
jury, due to the unsus-
tained fractions of its
representations.infl icted
upon the plaintiffs had
been so considerable as
to outweigh the propor-
tion of benefit conferred
upon the community at
large. And if represen-
tations made in good
faith, without malice,
and with honest purpose,
and, broadly speaking,
accurate, should contain
a minute infusion of al-
legations not absolutely
correct, it is distinctly
for the Interest of the
community that the re-
presentations should bo
regarded as a whole, and
a liberal appreciation of
their general import be
permitted. It is obvi-
ously not possible for
any public writer, how-
ever excellent his inten-
tions, and however clear
his faculties, to assure
himself beyond chance
of error on every detail
in all cases. A reason-
able latitude of infer-
ence must be conceded;
otherwise, to describe or
comment upon any
wrong will be to court a
penalty for trying to do
the State a service. ’
Sir George Innes,
Sept., 1884.
“And so long as truth
in the statement of facts
was adhered to, the sub-
stantial broad truth
even though in some
small matters of detail
there was an absence of
absolute accuracy—and
In the comments upon
these facts the writer
confined himself to fair,
reasonable, and honest
comment under the cir-
cumstances — to com-
ment which fairly and
legitimately arose out of
the facts — the writer
was not subject to an
action for libel, nor was
the publisher, no matter
how severe the animad-
version, nor how tren-
chant the comment, nor
how unqualified the
condemnation.
Was this substantially a
truthful account of the
circumstances of the
case, and in this case,
where the truth might
in their opinion be de-
parted from, did the
paragraph transgress
the bounds of fair and
legitimate comment*
and narrative of the his-
tory of the case ?’’
There we have the most charming harmony.
But the question is, how long will that har-
mony be maintained ? The next ruling may
“let down the pegs that make this music,”
although Bench and Bulletin are “well
tuned now.” Uncertainty is nearly as had
as oppressiveness, in the administration of
laws. We should counsel the legislature to
take this latest ruling as the basis for a
declaratory Act, and so eliminate the un-
certainty on.oe for all. And, while their
attention Is engaged with the subject, they
might consider other bearings on the libel
laws.
« • •
Mr. O’Brien, M.P., is “ have ”
Mr. Crown-Solicitor Bolton for the amount
of the libel verdict given in the latter’s
favour by a “perfectly impartial jury” in
the Orange town of Belfast. In other words,
Mr. O’Bbien intends to free himself from
liability by bankruptcy, as he cannot pay.
What a pity for the “constituted authori-
ties ” of the modern Sodom and Gomorrah
that the case couldn’t have been tried in
New South Wales, where Bolton, if unable
to squeeze out his coin in the Insolvency
Court, could, after putting the carcase of
his debtor into gaol for a year, have held
O’Brien as his bondsman for ever! They
have gone back in civilisation in England.
In New South Wales, on the other hand, the
44 proper representatives ” who still control
the current of what is ironically called justice
strenuously maintain the libel laws enacted
here in the days when it was necessary that
the adulterine children of Royal bastards
and the profligate irresponsible penny Nebos
who ruled with cat and gallows in the name
of their relative, His Glorious Majesty the
Defender of the Faith, should have ample
means at their disposal for protecting them-
selves from the awkward effects of the
truth being told. Even in Ireland, a
man who sues a man civilly for libel cannot
of his own motion imprison him. He may, if
he chooses, proceed against him also crimin-
ally, and, if the jury And defendant guilty,
then it is for the Judge—who even in Ireland
rarely makes political speeches from the
Bench, and never publicly endorses the
spirit of the existing libel law—to flne him
or to send him to gaol, as he deems fit. In
New South Wales, one is liable not only to
criminal prosecution and fine or imprison-
ment (or flne and imprisonment) in respect
to a criminal charge of libel, but he may,
after having been sentenced to imprison-
ment on such a charge, have to go to gaol
for another year in default of paying a ver-
dict gained, or costs incurred, by his pro-
secutor in a civil suit subsequently insti-
tuted against him.
<* • •
Should plaintiff, however, lose his case, he
need pay nothing, for he can become
insolvent and laugh at the defendant,
and he cannot be sent to gaol. With
him it’s “heads 1 win, tails you lose.”
In Great Britain, imprisonment for debt
having been abolished, there is no longer
j imprisonment for non-payment of libel
damages. It is for the Crown to
judge whether or not an alleged libeller
deserves to be put on his trial criminally,
and exposed to the chance of being sent to
gaol by the Judge. But in New South
Wales, where still are fondly kept alive the
murderous traditions of the convict days,
any scoundrel who on a mere technicality
gains a civil verdict against a journalist for
libel not only has the body of that journalist
delivered over to him for twelve months,
but is thereafter allowed to follow him up
to the day that the defendant is screwed
down in his coffin, on which article
he is permitted to levy an attachment.
In other words, suppose a man is found
guilty of a criminal libel in the Supreme
Court of N.S.W., he may be sentenced to
(say) six, three, or two months’ imprison-
ment, less or more, or he may be merely
lined; but should he, in a civil action with
regard to the same alleged libel, be mulct in
one farthing damages and some costs which
he cannot pay, then he goes to gaol for
twelve months and'become a bondsman for
ever, as insolvency will not relieve him from
liability. Thus, the Judge who, in the name
of society at largo, condemns a man for libel,
ling your fellow-citizen, may only put him
in gaol; but the gainer of the civil verdict,
who puts him into gaol, not impartially
and on public grounds, as in the case of the
Judge, but merely for the purposes of his
private vengeance, is allowed to incarcerate
him for twelve months, to say nothing of the
legalpowers which he subsequently exercises
over him and any property he may acquire
thereafter. In one case, the defendent pre-
sumably goes to prison because the Court has
not thought that his case can be met by a
fine; in the-other, he goes to Darliughurst
because he is poor. His revengeful
judgment creditor can send him to gaol for
a year in a case where an ostensibly impar-
tial fudge, by whom he has already been
tried and sentenced, has considered he
would be sufficiently punished by an hour’s
imprisonment.
• » •
This state of things is worthy of Abyssi
nia, where they cut steaks from living
cattle; it also reminds one of the Chinese
system, under which a pauperised debtor
is handed over, not to justice, but to his
creditors, Avho are allowed to “take it
out” of him by plucking off his finger-nails
or gouging out his eyes. It is a state of
things admirably characteristic of the legal
system which practically allowed no counsel
to a Frenchman who could speak no
English, and was on trial for his life;
and which hanged him in the face of a
formidable doubt as to his guilt. Of
course the legal authorities will tell you
that a man is rarely or ever prosecuted
civilly and criminally in New South Wales
for libel. The Attorney-General, they will
point out, does not grant his fiat for a crimi-
nal prosecution in any case where the de-
fendant is worth legal powder and shot.
Then, we reply, a rich and pecuniarily re-
sponsible defendant has in that case an
advantage as compared with a defendant
who is notoriously moneyless. A libel for
which a man is put in gaol, civilly, for a
year, may not be worth an hour’s imprison-
ment. On the other hand, it may be deserv-
ing of five years. Should not the power of
imprisoning be in the hands of the Judges
alone, and not in the hands of the prosecu-
tor, who is sworn to vengeance? Why
should not the widow who has been swin-
dled be placed in as good a position as
that of the man who has been libelled?
That is to say. why should she not, after
she has got her enemy convicted at the
the criminal sessions and sent to gaol, be able
when he comes out to put him in prison again
for twelve months should he fail to satisfy
her demand for the restitution of her money ?
In New South Wales the journalist is held by
the law to have a lower status than tue house-
breaker or horse-thief. The horse-thief who
has ruined himself by committing a erime >
and then getting into the hands of the
lawyers, is only tried and sentenced once j
for the same offence, and when he comes
out of gaol he can obtain his insolvency
certificate. The journalist cannot. ;And the
reason is that a large section of the “ first
family” ruling powers would far rather see
this land infested by hereditary congenial
protdjcs in the shape of privileged scoundr els
of ail sorts, from the undetected burglar to
the unprincipled seducer and therich fraud-
ulent insolvent, than allow any newspaper
the chance of telling the truth or of getting
a lair trial. Is character in New South Wales
so much better and more valuable than
character in any other English-speaking
country ? or, is it worse ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Pop-shop’s Parson.
The money-changers were once kicked out of the
temple, but that was long ago. Tom Cannon, the
jockey, is patron of a living in the Church of Eng.
land, and so is Attenborough the well-known
London pawnbroker, who is now a millionaire, for
he has been lending at all sorts of per-centages,
during many years past, £100,000 which was left
him ny his “ uncle.” Attenborough, who has
pawnshops all over London, owns the freehold of
the historic Catesby Abbey, in Northamptonshire,
and has in his hands the power of appointing the
local parson—which privilege appears to have
fallen into his possession, not as an unredeemed
pledge, but as a straight matter of purchase, with
money made out of the hypothecated portraits of
people's ancestors, and out of “ popped ” waist-
coats and “spouted ” shawls. Delightful, isn't it?
Jult to think the “Book,” which, as Pastor
Auden and all the Protestant-Hall and Protestant
Standard gentry tell us, is “ The Secret of Eng-
land’s Greatness,” being expounded by some
wretched clergyman with a long family whose
necessities are so great that he has had to pawn his
Geneva watch for seven and sixpence—and in so
doing has made the acquaintance of mine uncle.
No usurer, the Bible tells us, “ shall enter into the
kingdom of Heaven.” Shan’t he ? George At-
tenborough and Aaron Waxman will see to
that, and so will the bondholders who are trying
to screw the last drop of blood out of the
Egyptian fellaheen. We have at last succeeded in
bringing religion to a convenient and practical
form. The clergyman may now write his sermon
“ against ” usury upon the backs of disused pawn-
tickets in the “ private office ” of his patron and
master the local Mr. David Henry, ard the organ
will peal to an accompaniment of jingling sove-
reigns in the capacious pocket of the 1400-per-
shenting Mr. MXrks Hermann. But now that the
Established Church of England is distinctly under
the “patronage” of an avowed pawnbroker who
hangs out his gilt “ three [to one ” in half the
streets of London, there may be at least an out-
side chance of the many hundreds and thousands
of money-changers who have long been masquerad-
ing in the front pews as uncanonised saints and
wingless angers, coming out of their shells. They
may now, perhaps, be emboldened to tell the res*’
of the congregation that they are prr-pared with
their own fingers to lend the filthy lucre at 60 per
cent, on promissory notes at three months, renew-
able at 25 per cent, quarterly additional, and se-
cured by bills of sale. For this reason, we are
rather glad to see the three balls hanging out from
the Church-door at last. But hasn’t the time
arrived for another Reformation ?
Barmaids.
A few people may possibly still remember that in
Sydney, two or three years ago, a young gentle-
man who used to pose as a poet, and who is popu-
larly supposed to have parted with much coin of
the realm in vainly endeavouring to make his
numerous publications “ gee,” tried to “ reform it
altogether ” by proposing the abolition of bar-
maids. Well, this young gentleman is himself now
practically abolished, yet the barmaids go on—pro-
bably for ever. But the mantle of the barmaid-
extinguisher appears to have fallen on the editor
of the Sydney Liberal, who will perhaps be
pleased to hear that a doleful jeremiad lately pub-
lished in his paper on the Hebe question has been
reprinted in the London Echo. In the galimathlas
referred to, it is stated that, “ owing to the large
preponderance of the male over the female ele-
ment in N.8.W., the barmaids soon get married”
(which is but a half truth, for the man who writes
this has been served with drinks by the same
pretty girls for years and years), and that “ the
bad ante-natal influences exercised over the chil-
dren of such mothers cannot too deeply be de-
plored.” We are not going to argue the bar-
maid question now, nor do we feel inclined
to say whether, in our opinion, it would
be better were whisky publicly dispensed by men
alone. We emphatically decline to unbosom
ourselves as to whether, did Nellie preside
over a whisky-mill at one corner and the editor
of the Liberal rule an opposition pub. equally
adjacent to this office, we’d patronise the little
woman who smiles—oh I so sweetly—when we
(and, alas I all others) enter the bar, and who
makes such wry faces as she squeezes the lemon —
or deliberately go across the way to be fascinated
by our learned brother in spectacles. Lots of
fellows—“squattahs” from Australia—used to
stand in front of Spiers and Pond’s Criterion bar,
and tell to Hebe wondrous stories of the wealth
and beauty of the land of the kangaroo. But,
now that Hebe has seen it all in print for herself—
now that she has learnt on the authority of the
Sydney Liberal, price twopence, backed up by
the London Echo, price one halfpenny, that she
can go from London, where she gets ten shillings a
week and is not allowed to shake hands with any-
body across the bar to Australia, where wages are at
least a pound, and where she can kiss Jumbuck,
Esq. (from the Barcoo) behind the bar Alter—
where, also, she is bound to get a husband soon,
who will discuss the subject of ante-natal in-
Auences with the editor of the Liberal— why,
under all these circumstances, can anyone reason-
ably expect anything but the arrival in Sydney of
Hebe from the Criterion, and Hebe from the
Horseshoe, and Hebe from the Caf<5 Monico, as
soon [as they can get their clothes ready ? The
editor of the Liberal is solely responsible for the
forthcoming invasion of the Queen City of the
South by London barmaids, who will, so says tho
Agent-General, all be provided with letters of in-
troduction to the gentleman who has, across
twelve or fourteen thousand miles of ocean, so
adroitly thrown them a “ fetching ” bait.
Australian Fervour.
“ Jn the fervour of its religious communities, in
the devotednees of its clergy, the piety and gene-
rosity of its faithful children, Australia,” said
Archbishop Mohan, “ yields in nothing to the
mother country at home.” If we assume that a
residence of two weeks, and with a constant sur-
rounding of men who flatter, and whose whole life
is mixed up in Church matters, is a sufficient time

to enable Dr. Moran to arrive at an estimate of
the enthusiasm of the laity and the “ devotedness’>
of the clergy, then his comparison of the state of
things here renders the state of things at home in-
telligible. As a matter of fact, we, who have lived
here most of our lives, know no distinction what-
ever in our dealings between Catholic and Protes*
tant. Iu the cricket-held, or in the lodging-
house, nine out of ten young Australians do
not know nor care to what Church another
belongs. “Fervour” in such matters is not only
not known, but is, to most, unintelligible, or
reckoned a species of cracked-brained ness. The
Australian takes no more interest in the points of
difference of religious belief between Churches,
or their old feuds with one another, than he does
in the wars of the Hottentots. A glance at an
ordinary congregation shows a preponderance of
old people and women—the former attending
because they have been accustomed to it, and the
latter to a great extent from a love of display.
The younger people are in the parks, or on the
harbour. It is idle to put down this state of things
to secular education; for it obtains equally as weli
amongst those who have been brought up in the
sectarian schools. Nor can it be said that it is
accompanied by a morality in any way inferior to
the older generation. The “fervour,” the “de-
votedness,” and the “ piety,” Dr. Moran will find,
are directed to other objects than the ecclesiastical
ones of any Church.
The Government Railway Policy.
The map which we print in another page will give
at a glance a better idea ot what the new lines
proposed by the Government really are than
would pagss of descriptive writing. It cannot be
denied that the Government scheme looks very
rational as mapped. That is to say, the net-work
principle—the idea of bringing every part of the
territory within reasonable distance of a railway—
is fairly adhered to. There are, of course, a
variety of serious considerations, non-attention
to any one ot which might render the apparent
comprehensiveness of the “net-work” system
delusive. The plan of the Russian Czar of
drawing a straight line with a ruler between two
localities would look better on the map than any
curved or crooked line, and yet migat be the most
ruinous folly. The character of country to be
traversed, the gradients Involved, the possible
amount of traffic to be carried or of production to
be stimulated, are more important than directness
of routes. We may presume that these and kin-
dred subjects will be thoroughly studied by the
Legislature before the Government proposals are
finally sifted and adopted, modified, or rejected-
The scheme submitted is one of magnificent pro-
portions, and, coupled as it is with a project of
borrowing of unprecedented magnitude, must be
accepted as indicative of a strong and bold grasp
on the part of the Ministry. In this respect, the
country is scarcely likely to be better served. The
largeness of the proposed borrowing appears not
to have dismayed the constituencies. There is a
MiCAWBER-iike complacency evinced in this re-
spect b/ the public. The resources of the colony
probably will justify this confident attitude. And
if this be the case under existing conditions, con-
ceive what it might have been had the Govern-
ment been still more “ comprehensive ” in
their; conceptions and more bold in their policy.
Let the reader imagine what might have been
done in the way of railway construction with
borrowed money, had the Government of this
colony evolved a plan in which the land system
railway construction, and immigration, were
mutually interdependent. Let us suppose that
along everj projected line of railway, settlement
reserves had been instituted, either
on the leasing system, or for alienation to oc-
cupying settlers only, while simultaneously
a stream of population was drawn to the
country. If leasing were the plan adopted,
the increment of values given to the lands served
by the railways would have been not merely avail-
able to pay the interest, but ample to provide a
sinking fund to repay the capital cost; while
settlement and population planted everywhere
along the course of the lines, would furnish busi-
ness to make the railways themselves profitable.
By absolute alienations less would be accomplished
as to recoupment of the public creditors, and there
might be danger as at present of the land falling
into few hands, thus affecting by absence of popu-
lation, the profitableness of the railways. By the
Present haphazard j system, which provides no
harmony .between railway c nstruction,;iand alien-
ation, and settlement of population, not one of
these advantages Is secured. We believe that,
notwithstanding this, the colony will be able to
hear the burdens, disposed though they be so as to
be least easily borne. But the power of the colony
to sustain such a load is not more an evidence of
ita enormous economic strength than it is a testi-
mony against the short-sighted plans which fail to
make the best of the natural opportunities ready
to the hand of the statesman who “ is not yet”!
| he verdict of the Coroner’s jury, relative to the
' oath by poison of Mrs. Payne, will not, we be-
leve > be endorsed by public opinion. It is possible
at the jurymen were unconsciouslv influenced
y circumstances which could not affect persons
y 0 merely read the evidence. There may have
cn that in the demeanour of witnesses which
° ured the impressions of the jury. But, so far
be facts elicited by evidence at the enquiry are
oncerned, foundation for the positive terms of
e ver dict is sought in vain. That there were in-
■ P ‘cable circumstances, is true. But inexplicable
cmnstances are not necessarily suspicious ones.
e .® re Waa one special fact brought out by the
Mr 6 p° e ’ nam ely, that the strychnine which killed
' " Ay ne had been purchased by herself. And
t^e re Were facts, essential we think for justifying
Ver dict given, which were emphatically not
ab led - That is to say, there was an entire
an ence evidence, or even of presumption, that
Sof Per8 ° n a motive for killing Mrs. Payne.
4n ar 8,8 the evidence went, it did not appear that
who° ne Wou^d he beneficially t fleeted by her death
an by any theory be supposed to have had
th e p P° rt unity of administering the poison. On
a bsen 6r and ’ there was an apparently equal
have 08 °^. any reason why Mrs. Paynk should
the ( j Coailll *tted suicide. Disoassionately reviewed,
11 t of the evidence, as a whole, appears to
point directly to accidentarself-poisoning; and we
cannot avoid the conclusion that, in returning a
verdict that Mrs. Payne was poisoned by some
person unknown, the jury went outside the evi-
dence, and permitted their minds to be swayed by
indefinite and practically unsupported impres-
sions.
The Tichborne-Orton-Creswell Mystery.
On our front page, to-day, we reproduce the
portraits of the two Ortons and the lunatic known
as Creswell, whom they claim to be their brother
Arthur Orton, in whose name the TDhborne
Claimant is now serving the last few weeks of
his two cumulative sentences of seven years each.
To the foregoing portraits we have added those of
the Claimant himself, and of Thomas Creswell,
who on his part claims to have recognised the
alleged Orton—the lunatic known as Creswell—
as being really and truly his brother William.
Thus, our readers have placed before them in one
group all the parties in this extraordinary ques-
tion of identity, and can form their own opinions
as to family resemblances. For our own part, long
and close study of the live likenesses nas sug-
gested one idea. It seems to us that the so-called
William Creswell, although not strikingly resem-
bling any of the other parties, is more like the
Ortons than he is to Thomas Creswell. Also, that
the Claimant is more like Thomas Creswell taan
be is like the Ortons. The Tichborne case in
all its developments has long since exhausted
people’s faculty for astonishment. It seems to be
generally admitted that the so-called William
Creswelli(the lunatic) and Arthur Orton were ac-
quainted with one another, and that their careers
had crossed, and even had been mixed up in a sort
of mist. Now, how would it be for a fresh com-
plication, if the clue supplied by the likenesses
were foilowed up, and it were discovered that the
Claimant is neither Sir Roger Tichborne nor
Arthur Orton.? Suppose that the Claimant shouid
be William Creswell,'and the so-called William
Creswell should be Arthur Orton I

VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Hymn to Humbug.
VERSES UNTO VICE.
( Continued .)
When Mudgee Taylor heard the Veteran’s praise,
He pondered o’er his own peculiar ways;
And, in replying, in a timorous strain,
Confessed he’d sinned, and meant to sin again;
But, vowing from his course he ne’er would
budge,
Said “Let Posterity my actions judge
Implying other times his sins would crown
With Patriot’s name and Senator’s renown.
Plainly he showed his unavailing rage
On this perverted and misjudging age;
And deep the censure he thus cast on thoso
Who now combine his efforts to oppose;
And this the constant burden of his song:
“ I act aright, all other men are wrong I ”
And shall Posterity thus eulogise
What seems but vicious madness in our eyes ?
Shall other ages revel In those scenes
Close following on that banquet of sardines ?
Or other times, when blasphemy’s more rare.
Extol that imprecation, “ Damn the Chair ?"
f such does happen, then the course of Time
Shall elevate the low to the sublime,
And seat some men, whom Humbug calls his own,
With white-washed name, on Virtue’s lofty
throne;
Or with the laurel and the bay adorn
Those whom their fellow-men received with
scorn.
Then, Davis will be called beneficent,
For lending cash at sixty-six per cent.:
And deemed a worthy servant of the State,
And qualified in Council to debate,
Because he tried young Bayliss to relieve
By selling off his goods on Christmas Eve;
And Ormiston will surely earn some praise,
Because he helped the generous loan to raise.
Then, too, John Davies will be counted free
From all things that disgrace a C.M.u.
And pliant Stuart, by a judgment kind.
Will be extolled for his decided mind;
Whilst to oblivion then will haste the tale
Of how he collared lands for coal and shale.
And, M’Elhone, how high thy name shall standi
Renowned for classic lore and manner bland;
Noted for moderation in debate,
And from corruption most immaculate.
Then, Holborow, a generous race shall yield
Praise to thy conduct in the ’Ouse and field;
And Sladeu’s ghost a ghastly ode shall write
To prove thy valour in the deathless fight;
Benignant ages on thy name shall smile,
And hail thee as the “ Saviour of Argyle.”
And, Mudgee David, those two generous days,
For deep consistency shall sing thy praise;
Shall tell how good Sir John e’er strove to teach
Truest morality, by act and speech;
And, strong in Virtue’s all-prevailing force.
He strove to silence language wrong or coarse.
But, if such laurels shall adorn these men,
What will be thought of Bright and Gladstone
then !
If such be; heroes, Beaconsfleld shall fade,
With all his deeds, to dark Oblivion's shade;
And Henry George’s Land Conversion scheme
Be lost in Lethe’s ever silent stream.
Just so via Parson's style) we dare to say,
When Bright. and Gladstone’s fame shall pass
away,
When Beaconfleld on memory has no claim.
And Lethe’s waves roll over Bismarck’s fame;
When dark forgetfulness enfolds these men
Taylor shall be admired— but not till then.
Thou, who art Mudgee’s chief and constant pride,
Must still exhibit genius misapplied;
Still must we see thy native vehemence
So ill employed, because thy common sense
Does not avail to curb thy impetuous pace;
So every effort ends but in disgrace
If thou wouidst now thy speech just moderate;
Strive to reform, not overturn, the State;
And try for those dark evils to prescribe
Which, with thy pen, so well thou canst de-
scribe—
Then may thy genius earn the just applause,
When it shall serve to make, not break, our laws.
Then next we see, adorned with Humbug's dras 3 ,
A host of small “Apostles of the Press,”
Who, with their ‘ rags.” where every line’s mis-
spelt,
Start to supply a “ want that’s long been felt.”
Their opening issue yells for Liberty—
Succeeding issues whine for £ s. d.
Show forth in print each township episode.
And keep a comer for the bellrngn’s ode;
And with such care describe the six-legged calf
That all can tell his place is on the staff.
Tis strange to note what petty things engage
The writer’s effort in the weekly page;
But still the “ boss ” stays on, till money fails.
And then goes back to splitting posts and rails.
Small is the harm these little “ rags ” can do—
Small is their influence, their readers few—
When, for the axe “ the staff ” has laid aside
His pen, few know another “ rag ” has died.
But who can read, without a rising blush
Of shame, that daily hash of moral slush.
Where every vice that e’er disgraced mankind,
And all the smut that charms a filthy mind,
Combine, with some poor fallen woman’s tale.
To gain the shameless print a greater sale ?
As to the Gardens birds of various sort,
From many lands, we carefully transport
To deck its grounds, and please the eager eye
With brilliant plumes our own land ean’t supply.
So this production, in its varied page.
Exhibits muck from every land and age.
And joins with a divorce from Baltimore
Police Court depositions from North Shore;
Shows how a Dublin man deceived his wife'.
And prints the records of a Savage life.
London and Paris, Rome and Darling-street
Must all subscribe to fill the ghastly sheet:
And scavenging is done with so much care,
That penny woith of filth is always there.

To join with them in marriage tie.

England’s braves -to Bill M'Murdo, whom Forhe?,
in another part of his screed on the British Volun-
teer. calls “ Sir ‘ Montague’ M'Murdo.” Well, one
of Mac’s names is Montague; but he never used to
sport it, preferring his first and far more Christian
name of Bill. If it be true that of late he has gone
in for that measly pretentious “Montague” (which
always makes us think of Tigg and Manning and
Levy), all we can say is that the last state of the
man is a doosid sight worse than tho first, when
there were no frills about Napier’s Mac.
Rough upon rats is old man John Bright,
the Quaker tribune, and here’s what he recently
said touching one species of the vermin: “The
peers of England have entered the temple of
honour, not through the door of merit, but
through the sepulchres of their ancestors. They
are no better than their fathers, and some aro
worse. They are the spawn of the blunders, the
wars, and the corruption of the dark ages of our
history, and their privileges have produced
nothing but ignorance and arrogance.” There
are several other things also, but John’s' breath
ran short just here, and he had to reluctantly step
back and sample the contents of a new filter.
NEVER!
So! Faded from that room, sweet Perce —
That room which thou didst so adorn—
And, oh, Adonis, what is worse,
Of all thy little power shorn!
It cannot be—they must retract:
The earth revolves, and Lucas sacked!
A thousand times, oh, Percy, No!
Why, we would just as lief believe
That rose-buds grew in Arctic snow.
As thou, of all, should, Lucas, leave!
But, if you must, why make them pay;
Your dad, dear boy, can show the way.
A well-known gentleman wasn’t invited
to Prince Leopold's funeral; but, not to be licked,
he donned the regulation garb; and. being known by
the palace officials, was let in. Being caught sight
of and recognised by Ponsonby Fane, an effort was
made to get him out; but it was found to be im-
practicable! When the show was over, the unin-
vited guest duly seated himself in the special
train; but there Royal vengeance overtook him,
as he was “ billed ” out by the police. People
have tried to palm Heaton off on us as the hero of
this yarn ; but we know better. Henniker
wouldn’t have gone without a ticket. He'd have
bought one. And how many second sons of noble
lords would have b?en glad to part with their
pasteboard for a twenty.
Mr. Anthony Hordern, who may be termed
the railway-king of Western Australia, has just
arrived in Sydney from that colony, having ob-
tained the contract for the construction of the
Beverly-Albany railway, as he returns to Eng-
land to commence operations almost immediately,
his stay in Sydney will be of the shortest. Mr. Hor-
dern's scheme is certainly a gigantic one, embrac-
ing as it does the construction of 300 miles of rail-
way-providing steamers to bring out not only the
materials, hut the manual labour and implements,
as well as the population to occupy and cultivate
the land contiguous to the railway. To ordinary
mindsjthe scheme seems Utopian limits magnitude,
but what capital combined with Mr. Hordern’s
peculiar energy will do remains to be seen.
An anti-flogging meeting was recently
convened in Newcastle, and it was to be conducted
by “Mr. Norton of the Evening News,” the
gentleman whose fiery eloquence caused so much
“ astonishment and admiration ” at the Mercantile
Rowing Club banquet. It seems, however, that
the orator, for some reason or other, never turned
up, and alter waiting for a short while, the meet-
ing cursed Itself away. A local organ re this
matter, has the following:—“We had the pleasure
of being introduced to this so-cailed representa-
tlve of the E. News, and must say that his method
or fulfilling the mission he visited Newcastle for,
neither redounds to the credit of that journal or
himself.” Cela (Upend. Perhaps Alfred’s delegate
couldn’t attend. No Italics, as this Is a square par.
“Sir Thomas M‘H wraith,” says the Mary-
nOROTJOH Chronicle. “does not come back as
the heroic martyr to some great principle. His
six months’ absence is a very ordinary matter in-
deed, and he does not appear to have attempted
anything ‘noble’ during his tour.” When we
consider that our own Premier is back with us
again, that he was “noble” during tho whole of
his tour, that he made money as well as speeches,
and that he brought back a settled determination
to meddle no more with the Government of this
colony, we hug ourselves to think how green with
envy Queensland must be at our lot. His absence
was for us, and himself, no “ very ordinary ”
matter, indeed. He does come back “ a heroic
martyr to a great principle;” he has attempted
something noble—for once in his life. He has
agreed to let us ruin ourselves in our own way.
Glory to Sir Henry. He has found out when we
had enough of him.
There has been a funny case up at Gun-
dagai, and, as you might imagine, little Baley was
the defendant. Benson, a storekeeper there, it
seems sold W. H. L. some goods, and Bailey had,
of course, a contra for advertising. Well, Benson
and Bailey have a row, and Benson goes for the
Little Busy in the District Court there. The only
witness called was old Elworthy, who deposed that
he considered Bailey's charge of 10s. a column ex-
cessive, and that he only charged 3s. lOd. per
column in his paper, and had done so for 35 years.
If this, be true, the total advertising value of the
Gundaqai Goose would, supposing it were all ad-
vertisements, only amount to some £6 per issue.
Mr. Elworthy does not deny this; but he retorts
on Bailey, charging that modern Junius with hav-
ing "gone after” an advertisement for 3s. lOd. a
column, which he did not succeed In getting. Wa
have always longed to possess a country paper.
Now we absolutely yearn for one.
The Chctrch of England Record has re-
published Walker’s “ Recantation;” and it is very
funny. He is really a most musical lyre. He says
“ No newspaper, no seance, no friend, no spiritist
ever said that he was not c mtrolled, therefore they
are responsible.” Now, one paper did—the Free-
man’s Journal That paper bowled Thomas out
decisively, but Bowie Wilson (rest his feet!) was
making too much money out of the young fellow
at that time, and his influence was great with the
reporters. The Spiritualistic “push ” got hold of
Jimmy H , of the News, and converted him en-
lir ly to th-dr views. The first stance was held at
Captain Edwards' house in Bunt-street, and there
Walker delivered a lecture “under the influence
and in a trance.” A glowing report in the news
followed, and then the trance-lecturer commenced
to blink weekly at the Theatre Royal. When
James and Thomas meet on the fashionable pro-
menades, now, James angrily snuffs up the city
dust, while Walker becomes all of a sudden deeply
interested in the “skyline’s blue-burnished resist-
ance.”
The O’Donovan, who had telegraphed about
a million words re the Most llav. Dr. Moran to the
Freeman, dashed up, covered with dust, in a cab
the other day. He had been dreaming all the way
along in the train of the reception he’d have at the
hands of his confreres, and half expected to hear
the German band playing “ See, the conquering
hero comes,” in York-street. Leaping out of the
vehicle, he started back in surprise. The door was
closed, and on the step was a little boy sucking a
“lolly-stick." “HulloI” cried the O’Donovan.
“ Hullo I ’’ repeated the urchin. “ Why, where
have they gone?” “Home,” replied the imp.
“ Where do you live?” enquired the O’D. “Next
door," said the boy. “ And don’t you know me ? ”
enquired the special correspondent of the Free-
man. “No, I don’t,” said the youth emphatkul y.
What I shrieked the O’D.—“live next door, and
don t know me I And this,” he sobbed softly to
the cabman, “is my welcome home.” It was
Saturday morning, and they hadn’t given him ten
minutes grace. The holy staff had all gone to the
races! Our little joke.
Awkward! Why there’s no word in all
the bright lexicon of the English language that
can come within cooey of justice to the subject
hehearsal was late, and as the two divas hopped
into a tram, Hopped down on their seats like snow-
flakes on the bosom of a lake, the first lady pet-
tishly observed aloud that “you never can see a
cabby when you want one; but, however, a tram
,, e of the horrid crush, was better than no-
thing. She was a sweet, gushing thing of about
thirty summers, and Solomon’s best wife was
never arrayed as she was, nor smelt half so sweetly
either. Lying carelessly on her lap was a beautiful
morocco cylindrical case, on which the word
‘music’’ was stamped in largo gilt letters. The
car was well filled at the time, and the ladies were
the attraction of all eyes, when a clumsy galoot
stepping out accidentally knocked the music-roll
on the floor. Then there went a yell of laughter
up from that end of the tram that made the welkin
plug its ears with wool to stop the replication of
the sounds, for the dainty morocco had burst and
the contents, which strewed the oar, turned out to
be two pig's feet, about a yard of “polony,” three
rolls, and a quart-bottle of that Olympian nectar
known as “ wollop.” The ladies loft the car—and
their music, too—at that crossing.
Charles Bright says of Stout, the Free-
thinking New Zealand ex-Premier (an ugly phrase
but we have no better handy!) that “one of the
grandest traits in Stout’s character Is his prodi-
gious industry and capacity for prolonged work.
It la no uncommon event for him to be engaged"
all day In court In an intricate case, then to snatch
an hour for some meeting as director in a mercan-
tile association, preside after the evening meal at a
school committee or friendly society gathering
and coming home after ten, be followed in an
hour by a printer’s emissary to receive a hastily,
written leading article for some newspaper.” And
this is a grand trait, is it ? No wonder that we have
to read such slovenly argument and slip-shod
grammar in the leading articles of the daily papers
if many of them are written after this fashion.
We have no belief in this hasty writing—this
“ dashing-off.” There are some men who can do it
sometimes, but not often. But this is not the chief
objection we have to make with regard to Mr
Bright’s conception of a grand trait in character*
We say it is no grand trait in the character of any
man of great ability for good—Mr. Bright himself,
for Instance—to fritter himself away on a number
of small things. If he can do one great thing well
and as no other can, then o’ God's name let him do
it and leave the little things to little men who can
do them as well as he. But —as though we cared
for anything!
Have we seen Dr. Moran ? The question
makes us smile. At a rough guess, we have seen
something like 45,000 exact representations of His
Brace in the pages of our wonderfully and fear-
fully illustrated exchanges; and as each dazzling
daub represents a totally different style of man,
we naturally conclude the new arrival must be a
Protean sort of prelate, who has a fresh face and
form for every paper-stainer who calls round to
caricature him. in the Freeman we find a very
much Milesian style of party—one who evidently
has a “ fut av his own ” and the strength of will to
put it firmly down; but the c’rect card in the
Distress represents a one-eyed man who is suffer-
ing from the very worst type of small pox. The
Down and Gumtree has apparently touched up
an old plate of Li Hung, the Chinese ambassador,
In his official robes, and by substituting a cross for
a dragon and letting out the tucks in both ears,
Alfred has succeeded in giving us a chef-d'oeuvre
which, although not quite so phenomenally repul-
sive as the general run of his “ picture,” is yet vhe
enough to justify a jury in bringing lie a verdict of
justihable nomicide in case the subject of the
blood-curdling sketch burst in the brandy-and-
water-colour artis ’s skull with a meat-axe. The
Illustrated News gives us something in a “more
condoling vein,” as bully Bottom would say; but
the Mail’s pictorial libel represents the face of a
man who had evidently glutted his vengeince on
someone and had still two or three gluts on his
hands to spare. Yes, we have ssen Dr. Mho-nut -
and now we want a rest.
Persons who are addicted to the ele-
vating pastime of “booting” their unsuspecting
fellow-men, would do well to pause in their wild
enthusiasm for the noble sport, and sit down in a
cold spot and ponder over the fate of one Mr.
James Rodda, of Auckland. From the evidence
before the court, it appears that a Mr. Thomas
Buckman, of the same citv. told a few friends that
he was intensely surprised to find them associating
with a person of such shady antecedents as Mr,
James Rodda; and. this being told to that facetious
gentleman, he smiled sweetly, rubbed his hand
ominously round the toes of his No 9’s, and plea-
santly observed that he’d surprise Mr. Buckman a
trifle more before the golden sun had sunk to
rest. Shortly after this, Mr. Buckman happened
to be down at the Queen-street wharf stooping
over to examine some cargo just landed, when
Mr. Rodda tripped gaily along, and, balancing him-
self on his left foot, he got the right into a nice,
graceful swing, and then lifted Mr. Buckman
clean into the waters of the New Zealander’s lovely
harbour. This was capital fun for Mr. Rodda,
but it was nearly death to Mr. Buckman, who
struck his head against a collier's stern as fami-
liarly as if it had been the bosom of a long lost,
strawberry-tattooed brother. Be ng hoisted out
and hung across a fence to dry, Mr. Buckman
recovered, and, taking the law on Mr. Rodda, he
carefully stuck that gentleman for £150 damages.
As the part'es left the court, Mr. Buckman struck
an attitude, and requestol Mr. Rodda to take the •
worth of another century or so out of his un-
guarded person, but James was either too full of
kicking, or too short of ca h, as he positively de-
clined to go on again at anything like the price he
paid for his last enjoyment. According to the
rules of football, therefore, Mr. Buckman has nil
the best of the game as yet, he having scored a
goal to his opponent's “on© behind.”
The Siamese - tw’mship of saints being
broken, and Sankey dead. Moody alone remains to
a benighted world. But before leaving for a
belter, Sankey seems to have willed over to Moody
the power that was his (Sankey’s) own. Yes.—
For probably this good holy man,
Though now in a world of bliss.
Still likes to know that the dollars go
To the Holy Ring in this.
And this esprit de corps—or “corpse,” should we
rather say — was very creditable 10 and qi’ite
characteristic of Mr. Sankey. But the bereaved
Moody ;has made the ’ business boom in higher
circles. He is patronised by the nobility and gen-
tility in these virtuous days. What is the conse-
quence? Goes ho go oh thundering against vice
in high places, equally as in low ? Does he lash
the.poor with wnips, but the rich with scor-
pions? Is he mad, do you think? No, he B
not mad, and he does none of these tthluas-
He talks with vague eloquence about sin In the
abstract—which means sin among the Orinoco
Indians and the Ancient Egypiians, when it means
anything—and “never mentions Hell to ears
polite.” And. when interviewed by a representa-
tive of the Pall Mall Gaz&tte lately, the saintly
man informed thatgu leless journalist that “Lon-
don is the most religious city in the world.” The
hasty reader might object to this, and say that
recent statistics prove quite the contrary -that
they prove d r jnk, debauchery, fornication, adul-
tery, and every species of crime and devilry to pe
on the increase in London every season. Well-
But what have these things to do with the ques-
tion ? By saying that London is the mo t religious
city in the world Mr. Moody simply means that
London is the pity of the world in which he has
made the most money, and that he is too much oi
a blessed saint to be such a cursed simpleton as to
go and say anything to offend the people amongst
whom he was making his fortune. We consider
Mr. Moody to be a very virtuous man; and we
only wish that, when the play begins to pah 0“
him, he would adopt us, and such a pair of 1°° 8 ®
legs as we two would then shake over Europe
would simply turn the devil into a devotee through
sheer hopelessness of rivalry.

At a recent meeting, “ General” Soothsaid
that “ salvation, the remedy for all the wants, woes,
and miseries of the human race, was just as good
to look at in a red jersey as in a black coat-just as
good with a band as with a fine organ—just
as good with a lively as with a funereal tune. The
Salvation Arm.y had hhen more blessed by God
thail othbi' religious dtgatliZatlonS lot hundreds of
years.” Well, supposing that salvation, in the
“General’s” own words, is as good in one coat as
in another, where is the necessity for choosing the
red one, unless for the purpose of startling and
offending those who prefer the black ?
Bennet Burleigh, the war correspondent,
in his book on desert warfare, when referring to
the Soudan campaign, comments upon the poor
quality of the steel wrought into cutlasses and
bayonets for the soldiers. “ If these weapons
(says he) touched a bone, they bent like hoop-iron,
without piercing the body of the Arabs. Their
spears and swords, sharp a« razors, cut, as I saw
scores of them do, through hone, sinew, and every
obstacle, without turning the edge of the weapon.
But then the Arabs are not supplied with weapons
by an army contractor. When they reach the
pitch of civilization which the possession of army
contractors supplies, they too will have hoop-iron
cutlasses, and shoddy uniforms, and all the rest of
those military luxuries with which Tommy Atkins
is so painfully familiar. V
For some time past we have regularly for-
warded copies of The Bulletin to the Benevolent
Asylum, Dunwieh, Queensland, in the hope that
wo were thereby doing some little good in the way
of alleviating tne sorrows of those suffering from
the greatest of all afflictions. That our Idea was
sound miy he seen by a sentence from a letter
written by one of the patients, which says: “All
in our ward are totally blind, and the only thing
that brings a little life into us is to listen to the
paper which is read to us every morning.” Com-
plaint is now made, however, that of late the
paper has never reached the blind ward. We can
oniv say that it has been sent as usual, addressed
to the librarian, but marked “for the use of the
inmates;” and if any of the officials connected
with the establishment are appropriating it, they
are committing an act of gross injustice to the
unfortunates under their care, and also to our-
selves. Dictim sapientt gat est—or, in other words,
“nuff sed,”
Simultaneously with the resuscitation of
the Tichborne mystery by the proceedings rela-
lative to Creswell, comes a fresh crop of yarns
about long-lost ber-uthers and wandering heirs,
first; there is the New Zealand small-debts bailiff,
■frUo i§ bow tbf Lbrd and was badly licked, with the
tough fide tif thfe eifector’S tohgtles, ’tfhSn, on his
noble origin being dlsbotered; the fdadle§ of
his district rah him as a candidate for the House
of Representatives at the recent election. Then
comes Cave, of Bundaberg (Q.), whose Claims to be
recognised as Earl of Newburgh the English
Courts will shortly have to decide. The usual
uotiCe has been served on the tenants on the New-
burgh estates — for which overhaul your ‘’Ten
Thousand a Tear.” Cave is a gentleman, and a
t'erjr good fellow. He Used to be in tne Queeus-
Jabd Civil ServicC; a in the Works De-
partment, but having too mbch “go” in him to
fossilise in the official CaverbS, he Struck out
for himself, and is now b wine and spirit
merchant at Bundaberg. Then, next on the
list. “Some months ago a digger, Who gate the
name of Stanley, was admitted to the Hokitika
Hospital in a state of extreme illness and iibpecu-
niosity. In spite of the care of the doctors and
nurses; his state of healtn did not improve for a
long time, and when he was in a fit state to leave
he reg.ettod that he was unable to pay for the
tnbdidai attendance and board, and requested that
the bill for the athount should be forwarded to his
felatiVo bud friend, the Harl of Derby. Ihe secre-
tary of tho institution, efeeing that the Ilian wao of
gbod birth and education, but with aomC miSgiV-
ingsasto the Ksult, bested the bill to England.
By the return mail came a cheque for the amount;
The digger is ?t present in the Kanieri district.”
And, according to an English paper, another
“ poor relation,” at present in New Zealand is Sir
Charles Burdett, who, when Inst heard of, was act-
ing as cook to some labourers engaged in draining
the swamps ot the Waikato River. Sir Charles, it
appears, has descended to his present position
owing to a little failing which is prevalent among
Cooks. 'J he “swampsrs ” do not altogether appre-
ciate the baronet's efforts in the cu 1 inary ait, and
wlmn their viands are not to their taste he is re-
primanded in true Colonial fashion. Had it not
been for his unpleasant habits. Sir Charles might
at this tiloment haVo been occupying a distin-
guished position at home.
Michael tiavitt is a staunch and Uncom-
promising advocate of Henry George s land
nationalisation scheme, and he is not
regarded with a fraternal feeling by Messrs. Par-
nell and Biggar, who still would perpetuate the
rotten system of landlordism in Ireland, but under
a different name. A great demonstration of the
Nationalists was held on the 10th of August at
Monaghan, to which Mes rs. Davitt and Biggar
were Invited to deliver addresses, but the latter
wrote to the committee asking whether Mr. Davltt
had intimated his intention of being present, and
if so that he (Biggar) would notattend, winding up
his note thus:—“I so much disapprove ot bis
(Davitt's) opinions on the subject of land nationali-
sation, and of his conduct in other respects, that I
will not bear the responsibility of countenancing
him in any way.” And this is Davitt’s scathing
reply:—“Not for worlds would I allow my he-
terodoxy on the social problem of the day or
* my personal conduct in other respects ’ to
come between the wind and the nobility of
Mr. Biggar’s personality. For it is meet that
the atmosphere of such a paragon of righte-
ousne-s should not be contaminated by the
breath of land nationalisation, or a character so
stainless be even troubled with the suspicion of
a dangerous proximity to one of moral direliction.
Therefore, I will not withhold the hon. gentleman
from the Monaghan meeting. I might have sum-
moned up a lit- - ie of a by-gone fortitude with
* hich to confront the sentence of my political ex-
communication at the hands of so august an
authority on economic science, had the ex cathedra
pronouncement not been accompanied by the
virtuous reprobation of the ex-Parisian gallant
and mashing gay deceiver, Cavan’s Conquering
* Joe ;’ but 1 am now, alas, bereft of that consola-
tion which sustained a belief in my own virtue
before the awful mandate of St. Joseph Biggar
was spoken. Land nationalisation is no morel
Peace to thy philanthropic spirit, Henry George 1
No more shall laieser faire philosophy contend
against thy propositions, or landlord conscience
tremble at the future which thou hast foretold.
Joe Biggar has passed sentence upon thee; and
thus, as the unorthodox Atlantic consented to roll
bmk its troublesome waves in obedience to the
efforts of good old Dame Partington, who ‘re-
fused to bear the responsibility ot countenancing
it in any way,’ so will the tide of ‘the land for the
people’ recede, and the hopes of its advocates
vanish into thin sir, before the solemn and irre-
vocable condemnation of Joseph Gilles Biggar.”
Bravo! Michael; in faot, as they say in the ould
sod, “Glory to yer finger, Mick.”
Master Thomas Rooney, a Sydney public-
school boy of 14 summers, is a young gentleman
who bids tair to speedily acquire rank and fame, if
he is not untimely cut off by a heavy frost. On
last Monday week, this extremely piomising son
•ot the soil landed in Melbourne per steamer Bunin-
yong, and calling round'at the Great Britain Hotel,
told the landlord to “ fix him up proper,” as he had
lust arrived from Sydney to recruit lus shattered
nealtb, and see what sort ot a durned little village
Melbourne was, as he thought of giving up the
demn’d gay life he had been living, and intended
to settle down and steady himself till Christmas.
On the Thursday following, he was interviewed by
a detective, who found him reading, not a Bible,
as a good little public school boy should, but a
thrilling account of the “ Life and adventures of
j' ed Kelly,” or the “ Gory General of the Great
Lienrowan Guleh.” The detective, it appears, called
f- und in re a little matter of £300 worth of jewel-
lery which had mysteriously disappeared from the
residence of Mr. Thomas Alderson, of this city,
about the same time as that gentleman's hopeful
young brother in-law, MasterThomas Rooney, did.
with the customary nonchalance and gang froid of
the heroes of our three-for-a-shllling novels.
Master Rooney observe!, “Oh. it’s you, is it?
Detun'd annoying, this I was just doing a coml
portable read when you disturned me.” On the
thiet-taker becoming more communicative as
to the object of nis visit, Thomas Rooney
strode the usual three paces to the right,
iQi-ee paces to the lift, stopped short, and.
stnuing his noble brow, exclaimed: “Ah, ha I
rate f r ° W ns on Fernandez Filippo de Proiseant at
last, hut though caitiff slaves nis body bind, his
Proud haughty soul shall ne er be conquered.”
And then, taking a big “chaw ” of taffy, which
ior stomachic reasons he used instead of tobacco,
Master de Frniseant Rooney calmly observed :
i ou know why I did it. Becaus® my sister, with
wnom I was staying, accused me of having tam
P^ r ®? with my little niece. I was innocent, and
th V r e acc usatlon preyed on my mind so muon
mat I cannot hold mys«if accountable tor my
actions. I was quite beside myself and went to
nr? ?* ster ’ 8 drawer and took the jewellery.” Nothing
could exceed the coolness and cunning of this
> oung scamp. It appears that he knew mat pawn-
vT’"er8 are not allowed to take in pledges from
coiidren, and he forged some orders from imagin-
ary persons, authorising him to do the delicate
imi' 1 ®? 9 of pledging certain articles, The greater
the stolen jewellery was found upon him,

Moik 0 diamond pins had also been realised on in

hkndy.) ifre.ODl? tofehtion him to introduce a
little story. Long figo. ifi the palmy past, when we
shimmered nightly at the thCatfefi, wo w»nt to see
the Professor. There was with us fihotnet repre-
sentative of the Fourth Estate—now In the la
ebriates Retreat, we believe. When we took our
seats we were joined by a third journalist, who has
since risen to the topmost pinnacle of tame in the
produce-reporting branch of our glorious pro-
fession, and who was, even then, oppressed with
the Idea of his dawning greatness. Well—but we
must first tell you ths method of the Professor. It
was simply to ask A Humber of persons, male and
femdle, to tome up on the platform and have their
Characters redd, and their abilities assessed—to the
Intense delight Of those Who were wi§e enough to
remain in tnei# seats. The subjects operated on
were requested to walk up and down the platform
two or three times in their natural manner—the
result being, of course, that all of them, as by
instaut consent, immediately emancipated them-
selves from their previous peculiarities for that
occasion only, and walked like nothing that wains
on two legs. Their countenances, too, before ex-
pressite of some trleams of intellect, changed into
sodp-Ilkg stolidity— cakes of soap without even a
label! Yet,- froifi these feeble materials the Pro-
fessor boldly evolved the most majestic conclu-
sions One man especially* we remember, whose
physiognomy Would hate Stamped him, to any
ordinary Intellect, as the proprietor of a rat-pit,
was gravely introduced to the audience as a born
philosopher of the most extraord nary calibre. It
subsequently turned out that he was a cu p-and-ball
tosser when he was not engaged in a nine-pin
alley. And yet, perhaps, the Professor was not so
far out, after all. We cannot think, however, that
he was so happy in the case of another man with a
towering pyramidal forehead, when he said that
that forehead contained more veneration for law,
and refereace fof feigning authority, than all the
rest of the foreheads on the platform put to-
gether, considering that we had seen with our
own eyes, only the Sunday before, the owner of
that very forehead creeping out of the back-door
of a hotel with a Jug under his coat. Hardly, and -
[And what ? What In anathema has this got to do
with the story?—EP. H.j l he story, then, if you
must have it. It struck our friend, now In spirit-
less seclusion, and ourselves [who seem to be
on the fair way for it I — Ed. B.] that It
would be a good thing If a representative of the
Press were to go up with the next lot on the plat-
form and see Into the rights of the affair in tl e
Interests of the public. It did not, curiously
enough strike us that it would be altogether so
good a thing for either of us to go. One was too
modest (the present writer), the other too famous
already (the gentleman in retirement). So, of
course, upon the third devolved the g ory. And
he was nowise loth; the dauntless density that has
carried him unscathed through the vegetable wit
of many a produce market since then was his
friend in this case. Besides, he was a believer in
the Professor. He considered the character-read-
ing of the Professor genuine. So, nodding to us
with the air of a man whotil It #oilld not be safb
tor any man* even a Professor, to trine with, he
stalked Upon the stage like Ajax into the lists,
surveyed the audience for a moment with a stucco
affectation of calm calculated to throw the boys in
the back seats, who could not get at him, into a
state bordering on frenzy: and then, with a grand
acceptation of the littleness of modern life, took a
chair with the rest of the victims. One by one
these unfortunates were fl'ed out, made to go
through their paces, pronounced updn, and
back to their places in the bodS- 1 df the hall in a
state of gibbering imbecility. All the time these
mattyrdoms — awlully excruciating fcenes—were
(tping on, the Glory of the Vegetable Market sat
placidly in his seat. We could almost see his lips
moving to this tune; “These were but a poor lot
—wait till he comes to me I” Evidently he expected
the Professor to start with surprise on coming to
him and perhaps even to exclaim with a rapturous
sigh, “Ah-h! That brow! Those temples I That
tout ensemble! Here is intellect! for you* gentle- ■
men! Here is versatility and grace! This la a i
great journalist, gentlemen; I see It In his eye.
The eye never deceives!'’ But It did not turn out
that way. The Professor, after he had finished
with the others, was about to go on with some
other part of the entertainment, apparently for-
getting that there was yet somebody to deal with.
This was the cruellest cut. However, just in time
the great phrenologist saw his mistake and, turn-
ing round, said in an impatient way, “Now you,
young fellow, hurry up-can’t keep the audience
waiting for you.” At this we saw the angry Hush
mount to the highest pinnacles of “ that brow,” but
the Pride of the Pumpkin-Stall disdained to make
further sign. Evidently, thought he, he does not
recognise me yet. Therefore he walked out con-
fidently on the stage before the eyes of all, and
up and down it to order. But the same mys-
terious thirst to be unnatural, which had so sud-
denly seized upon the others, seized upon him
also. He walked down the stage like a panto-
mime policeman; he walked up it like a dancing
boar. He pranced like a centaur, and wobbled
like a duck. In the course of that brief, but ever-
memorable parade, he imitated the manner of pro-
gress of everything, except the human form, that
had motion in the heavens above, the earth be-
neath, or the waters under tha earth The
audience were frantic with deliprht. The Pro-
fessor then stopped him, and lookiiig at him with
one eye, and at the now quietly-e xpectant crowd
with the other, said: —“ Well, I have seen you
walk, I have heard you talk, I have looked at your
head, I have looked at you feet; I would rather
give my opinion of you to your friends. Go I”
And he went. But before he came down we had
was too much for even us. We met him
though, some time after, deep in atumip. Among
other by-the-ways, we happened to say “Very
clever man, that Professor tfimoal ” “ He clever'”
was the reply, “ you know his head I—well, look at
this turnip.” And with these terrible words he
drove his teeth half way through the top of the
bwede, and tore out a piece as large as a man’s fist
We shuddered and thought ot Ugolino left

Cheap Gas for every
Country Town.
There is no doubting the fact that science has
completely mastered the work of producing gas
without the use of coals. And it produces gas
brighter, cleaner, and for Inland towns cheaper
and safer, than the ordinary coal gas; so that the
value of this practical discovery to country people
Is very great. The new patent, which has been
strongly and unanimously recommended, is the
Needles Patent, which can be applied so as to
meet the requirements of only a small house, or
enlarged to meet the wants of a town. For the in-
troduction of this splendid invention the Austra-
lian public are indebted to Messrs. H. T. Smith and
Co., 43 Sussex-street, Sydney. The Needles Patent
has been submitted to every kind of test, and is
nowin use in several large hotels, halls, private
mansions, &o., all over the Australian colonies, ihe
universal experience being one of extreme satis-
faction. In and about the suburbs of Sydney,
there are several large private houses equipped
with the Needles Patent in preference to the coal.
The whole thing is very inexpensive, and in opera-
tion is far cheaper with regard to illuminating
power than kerosene, with none of its disagree-
able odours and none of its risks. When fixed in
position (the whole thing is portable), the gas
supply can be arranged by a boy; there is no wear
or tear—all that is required is a supply of the in-
gredient or gasoline which stands at from 2s. 6d to
is. per gallon. The gasoline at 2s. 6d. is for the
Needles Patents. There is not a resident in the in-
terior who once seeing the whole thing at work
would not Immediately become a purchaser.
Messrs. Smith and Co. have just imported a small,
effective and cheap gas engine, of 2-man power and
upwards, which they place tree on board train or
eteamer, with all gas-making apparatus, for £80.
This engine will make its own gas, drive a printing
press, lathe, cornshellcr, or haycutter. sausage
machine, Ac, and provide enough gas for 500 lights.
The cost of production of gas in under 7s. 6d- per
100) ft. Hand-power g«s apparatus to provide 20
or 500 lights ar« at the one price£25upwards. Here
is a testimonial from a well-known Sydney man
who preferred the Needles Gas to any other :—
Botany, July 25,1884.
Messrs. H. T. Smith and Co.,
43 Sussex-street, Sydney.
Gentlemen,— With reference to your memo, re
the “Meedles” Gas Apparatus, I beg to say that,
having had it in constant use for the last four
years, I have found it all that can be desired in the
wav of a brilliant clear light, free from all noxious
and offensive smells; and the surprisingly easy
mode of manufacture makes it a most valuable
adjunct. I have upwards of 200 lights, and since
you attached the small gas-engine it is so simple
that anyone can start the engine when lighting up,
and make the gas as it is used. Can be seen at
work, and burning any evening at Sir Joseph
Banks Hotel, Botany.—Yours truly,
FRANK SMITH.
At the Mudgee railway celebration, the banquet
hall and ball-room were brilliantly lighted by the
Needles Patent Gas, the work being superintended
by Mr. H. T. Smith himself. The results were per-
fectly astonishing.— Argus.

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist’s art. It looks like
gold, it is as heavy as gold, and itia more enduring.
None but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by the severest tests. Ornaments made
from this new composition are equal in design and
general appearance to those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe of
the Cost of the genuine goods.
Remember that wo do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is anything but a composition of pure metals*
but we do affirm that it is so perfect an imitation
of the s tor line - gold as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of it may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. So perfect is it, and so
large has our trad? become, that jewellers through-
out the colonies r,re complaining of the dullness
in trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their own customers. But as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
be sent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt ef
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE.
Should you be dissatisfied with your Investment
after inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where mails are few, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured—we
will return the money, deducting only the trifle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the articles not retained. Fair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and send in your
order for what you may require.
N.B —We find that, through an error on the part
of the manufacturers, we are overstocked with
Brooches, and for the purpose of making a rapid
clearance of that line of Goods, we will send to
any customer (post free, if at a distance) on receipt
of Five Shillings (5s.), a really exquisite Oriental
Gold Brooch, equal in design, finish, and appear-
ance to a Five Guinea Brooch of the sterling metal.
This offer holds good for a few weeks only, and is
made as much for the purpose of advertising our
Oriental Jewellery by sample as for any other
reason ; for the Brooches will keep, and they are
of the latest design. “To see is to want, is a
saying so applicable to our goods, that it pays us,
in the long run, to forward to any person a sample
Brooch at cost price. Examine our catalogue, and
write to us or cail on us for what you may desire.

With a melting modestly characteristic of
all that is theatrical, Mr. Luscombe Searelle’s
“Estrella”—produced at the Theatre Royal on
Saturday last, in the presence of a gigantic audi-
ence—was styled in the advertisements “ the most
successful comic opera of the time.” We sampled
this work of Mr. Searelle’s with more, perhaps,
than our usual care—partly because wo wished to
behold “the most successful comic opera of the
time,” and partly because we burned with anxiety
to hang upon the dulcet notes of Signor Carlo
Modini, who had “just arrived from Italy ” under
—we quote the play-bill—arrangement (sic) to
Messrs. Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove, and
who had, so to speak, the scent of his native maca-
roni still upon him.
• • •
“Estrella,” as we have it, so captivated
Mr. Garner when scintillating in “ the great city,”
that he purchased (presumedly for millions) the
Australian right of that production ; and, not
content with this brilliant managerial feat, char-
tered the gifted composer of the work to travel
hither and conduct it. So far as wo are concerned,
we are very glad to see Mr. Luscombe Searelle:
for one reason, because we are glad to see nearly
everybody (such is the largeness of our heart), ex-
cepting, perhaps, the party who calls for the water-
rate; but chiefly, we really think, because he is
the part author and the whole composer of “ the
most successful comic opera of the time.” It had
been thought by many that Mr. Garner would
have secured the right of such inferior produc-
tions as “ lolanthe,” for instance, or the “Princess
Ida;” but we are convinced all thinking persons
will agree with us when we state that it would
have been barely possible for even so experienced
a judge of the works of modern maestri to have
secured for a gushingly grateful country more
than “the most successful comic opera of the
time.”
• • •
“Estrella,” to us, and we say this apolo-
getically, is strangely suggestive of hash, and the
plays of Walter Reynolds. It reminds us—and not
altogether unpleasantly, mind you—of so many
things. And this may be said equally of the plot
and of the music score. The opera is indeed a
musical mosaic, not unskilfully constructed, of
"Barbe Bleue,” “Girolid,” “Tambour Major,”
“Olivette,” and “ Madame Favart.” Mr. Walter
Parke was, we believe, chiefly known to fame
(prior to the writing of “ Estrella ”) through be-
ing part author of “Les Manteaux Noirs. But
the fierce thirst for glory was, apparently, upon
him, and his fame has, as our readers, are now
aware, culminated in evolving the libretto of “the
most successful comic opera of the time.” This
noble work (conducted by the composer) was first
produced with Camille Dubois—that giddy divorcee
-in the title role, at the Novelty Theatre, London.
The plot of “ Estrella ” has been so abundantly set
forth in the Sydney Morning Herald—a journal,
we believe, published somewhere in the neighbour-
hood of this office—that it does not behove us so
much to enlarge upon the fable as to analyse its
interpretation. We must not invent facta with
regard to this piece—we must simply chronicle
circumstances—but, we think, it will be permitted
to us to state that had the trifling works quoted
above never have been written, Mr. Walter Par re
would not, in all probability, have grown big with
and been delivered of “ Estrella.” The cast of the
piece is a small one, and whimsically it may be
given as follows:—
Count Pomposi di Yesuvio, a Vene-
tian General betrothed to Estreila
: Capitaine de Merimac Kelly
Phylloxera, an impoverished Vine-
grower, father of Estrella: Rocoo J. Wallace
The Doge of Venice, a model of jus-
tice and dignity: Le Roi Bobeche P. Day
Signor Lorenzo, a young advocate
in lovewith Estrella: Prince Fri-
tellini Carlo Modini
Giovanni Tommaso, major-domo to
the Count: Coquelicot J. Forde
Notary: Gobo W. Forde
Estrella: Olivette Nellie Stewart
Tartarella, mother to Estrella, a
strong-minded woman : Madame
Lambertucchio Miss Santley
Brigetta, companion to Estrella, in
love with the Count: Fiametta F. Liddiard
The pirates, etc., by the Corsairs from
ana the “ Conspirators' Chorus.”
* * *
But, although the family likeness common
to all comic operas of recent date is thus recognis-
able, the arrangement of the plot is not without a
certain freshness. If Mr. Walter Parke has stolen,
88 h 88 stolen apnreciatively; and a comic opera
which combines the best effects and characters of
mose we have mentioned with equally felicitous
leatures of its own, could scarcely tail to have
attractions. Mr. Searelle, too, has done much to
put a distinct colour upon the libretto. His muse
~ everywhere melodious and in several move-
ments a distinct originality of theme is evolved,
me orchestration, also, is skilful and highlv effec-
tive. In the production of his opera, Mr. Searelle
“extremely fortunately circumstanced He has
uaa heaps of money spent upon him, and is fairly
uappy in fii s cast—the low comedy element being
paenomenally strong. And, what is still more in
p 8 , favour, consists in the fact that the role of
ryrelja (though somewhat sketchy and indefinite
dramatic conception) appears to suit Miss
tn» 6 Stewart better than anything she has done
or some time; and certainly better than any of
moso parts into which sh<i has been pitchforked
j y indulgent management, only to find herself
p'i nem hopelessly and painfully overweighted.
rp«r ap8 ’ .however. Miss Stewart’s unwonted suc-
tho t “ is occasion was in some measure due to
naL g ory she felt at being entrusted with the
ame-part in the “ most successful comic opera of
pme. ’ Mr. Searelle has provided her with
s ’~ e delightfully melodious airs, and her share in
duets with Signor Modini is equally felici-

the top as possible, the lions form a circle round

That’s just how the Theatre Royal audience be-
haved to Mr. Day, only when he tumbled down
they didn’t eat him, although they opened their
mouths quite wide enough. Now, when wo
tumbled down off our tree, the lions ate us up at

Mr. Wallace worked very hard to make
something out of Phylloxera; and it is but fair to
set down that his clowning was provocative of
some merriment. But everything Mr. John Wal-
lace has done in this piece he has done in other
pieces that have preceded it; and perhaps that is
the reason why his most outrageous efforts in
dance and by-play, conjured up within our souls
feelings of undiluted melancholy. Mr. John Ford
helped along with a major-domo's part; and a Mr.
W. Ford extracted some fun out of a not very
notable notary. A “Miss Santley’' (whoever she
may be) was boisterous as a shrewish mother, but
appeared to appeal for favour almost exclusively
to the groundlings. Miss Fanny Liddlard, in this
opera, is awarded a shadowy part, labelled “ Bri-
getta, companion to Estrella;” but her business
is so sketchy and vague in its conception by
Mr. Parke that the young lady has no chance
whatever of making a hit, though she looks charm-
ing as usual, and enslaves an avant scene box full
of whiskers, as is her nightly wont.
* * *
The scenery is pretty, and, in fact, the
staging of the piece is [altogether admirable, and
each time the curtain rose on a fresh set the
audience clamoured for Mr. Hennings with as
much vigour as was evinced on an historical
occasion, when an artist named Barabbas
was desired by an appreciative multitude.
On the first night it is evident that some mis-
creant must have been playing larks with the pro-
perty-man’s ball of twine, for all of a sudden all
the gondolas sank with singular unanimity to the
bottom of the Adriatic. They, however, bobbed
up serenely a few minutes later, though there was
an ubiquitousness (can you say this ?) about the
craft that was distressing to the soul of the lover
of the unities. The house was crowded. We could
have wished, however, that a gentleman at the
back of us could have found it convenient to leave
his hiccup behind him at the races.
* * *
“ Estrella ” has distinctly “ caught on,”
and has run to crowded and hilarious houses so
far. Consequently, it is to run the remaining three
weeks of the opera season.
* * * «
It must have been rather disappointing to
Mr. D’Orsay Ogden, after engaging “a grand
chorus of forty voices” (you will notice that a
theatre chorus always consists of “forty voices!”
—this by the way) to have to represent his “ great
moral lesson” at the Gaiety, “A Bit of Blue
Ribbon,” in the presence of a slender audience.
And the more so as Mr. Ogden had secured the ser-
vices of “that talented young actor. Mr. Fred.
Meredith,” In addition to which Miss Ellen Fergus
Ogden was announced to make in this “ farciful
(sic), sensational, temperance drama,” her dihut in
Sydney. But, as the old lady says in the novel,
‘ We cannot toujours have what we voulez.” Mr.
Ogden, doubtless, thinks it is very hard that tne
people won’t come to see him get very drunk in
the first act, and become impossibly sober in the
third, and to listen to Salvation Army hymns with-
out the humorous addition of the big drum oblioa-
to; but it has probably not occurred to that
gentleman that the play-going public has been
over-dosed with “ moral lessons ” of late, and that
but little sympathy now remains for the man who
gets drunk at the expense of his friends one day
and ‘ whips the cat ” the next at his own.
* * *
“Hair” Bandmann dosed us with this kind
of drama until we wished him more violently dead
than usual, though “The Woman of the People ”
had, putting aside its clap-trap, many things to
recommend it. The acting of the company was,
with a few exceptions, first-class, though, cer-
tainly, Daniel was without the advantage of having
specially engaged that talented young actor, Mr.
Fred Meredith.” We thought when the greatest
actor in the world shook the dust off his buskins,
when leaving this city “for ever,” that we were
free from a further infliction of the same class of
dramatic jumble; but we were doomed to be de-
ceived. Hardly were we lulled into forgetfulness
of the struggles of “Murry” and “Baretrong,”
hardly had we pitched with anathemas into the
abyss of forgetfulness all recollection of the wiles
of “ Rummy ” and the villainy of “ Happyany,”
than Arthur Vivian swoops down upon us and
resurrects all these semi-forgotten phantoms.
Once again have we to sit out “The Woman of the
Stokehole” (or whatever it is), and behold the
“talented young American actress” (raised in
Wellington), Miss Helen—no Nellies, mind you, in
“ A Great Moral Lesson 11”—moan as Marie, Arthur
Yivian writhe as and the “talented young
actor” (now specially engaged), “Mr. Fred. Mere-
dith,” bore you as Bertrand; and notwithstanding
that this gorgeous performance was promptly
whistled away into the provinces by an indignant
public, Mr. Ogden beards us once again with a
similar entertainment,
* * *
“A Bit of Blue Ribbon ” is an “agony”
play of the most advanced description, and the
management, doubtless, in producing it (and going
to the length of “specially engaging that talented
young actor, Mr. Fred. Meredith ”) contemplated
catching the Temperance portion of the populace.
Mr. Ogden, however, reckoned (in a double sense)
without his host, not considering, possibly in his
philanthropical desire to morally instruct the
people, that there is implanted in the hi easts of
the teetotallers a dogged (and virtuous) aversion
to “ parting their ochre ” at the pay-hole. The
pecuniary success, therefore, of Mr. Ogdon’s ven-
ture is so far considerably hampered by limits, and
we sincerely wish he had “put up the stuff”
for something of a more promising description.
From the shortness of its cast, “ A IBit of Blue
Ribbon” has evidently been compiled for the
“ road a conjecture which causes us to heartily
pray that it may take to the road as soon as pos-
sible—and get lost. But, though the piece is not cal-
culated to attract the 3d. drink crowd there is much
merit in some of the acting—D’Orsay Ogden dis-
playing good colour in [his interpretation of
Donald M’Gregor, who is our old friend Baretrong
feebly disguised as a Scotchman. Of Mrs. Ellen
F. Ogden we must also say many good things, that
lady evincing histrionic ability of a very high
order. It seems a pity, indeed, that, considering
how hard up the Australian stage is for “leading
ladies,” Mrs. O. does not go into stock, and show
them what she can do in a sensible piece and a big
theatre.
• ♦ •
We see that the company produce “ Oliver
Twist” next Saturday, in which D’Orsay Ogden
has made a great hit as Fagin. Mrs. O. is sure to
be good as Nancy; and it is a blood-curdling busi-
ness. The absence, in this drama, of the chorus of
40 voices will, doubtless, prove an additional at-
traction. We wonder, by the way, who will repre-
sent that good boy Oliver, who was a “ prig ” in
one sense but not in another.
* » «
It seems that Dan Barry’s company was in
Grenfell lately, and from Grenfell “ K.P.” sends us
the following epigram, in which E.P. is decidedly
E.P.: —
“In days of trouble many years ago.
When Saxon soil was trod by Norman foe.
The mace, the club, and dull two- handled sword
Lay prone the enemy upon the sward:
But gentler grown, in this more pliant age,
We fight our battles now upon the stage—
And, when we would poetic justice deal.
We kill the Norman now with Nita Steele.”
Nita Steelo and Norman are members of Dan’s
company, and play Florence O’Carolan and J. E.
Redmond, M.P., respectively, in “C. S. Parnell’s
patriotic drama, ‘Shamrock Green.’” Oh, and to
answer a correspondent on a theatrical matter, wo
may state that the last we heard of the Lyons
Tourist Party they were in India, and that Miss
Nina Tulloch was certainly of the company. And,
o wind up, b r f ure and don’t forget that to-morrow
(Friday) night is Billy Bent’s “ ben.”—this would
make an attractive “streamer.” William Horace
works hard for the public, and has pleasantly
fooled you to the top of himself for many a long
year. All the available talent is going to appear
| or Billy, so we hope there will be a big rollup.
In three months William goes to “ Murker,” when
doubtless he will be found frequently “ on the
corner.” Oh, and talking of America, the N.Y.
Herald says that Mary Anderson is going to join
the Carmelite nuns. But, enough of Mary for the
nuns—we mean, nonce. Our troubles, anyway.
* * * *
Madame Woody ear’s Equesquiriculum has
—this is a sporting age, confound itl—become
w tll-set ” in Belmore Park; and consequently
Madame (bless her I) is having a good innings. She
is, therefore, not likely (to continue in this con-
temptible style) to be “stumped ” at an early date.
Since last week the redoubtable Robert Taylor has
taken the management, and now the ring presents
a truly kaleidoscopic appearance. Mr. T. wears a
magnificent uniform, with brilliant blue facings,
and the biggest streak of bullion down the side of
ms pants that his military tailor could fix there.
He is gilt-buttoned, be-jewelled, and hair-oiled to
that extent that the moment he enters every boy
present mentally vows that he will burgle the gold-
embroidery shop and be a circus-director—or die.
Not to be beaten by this gorgeous apparition. Pro-
fessor Sylvester dons a rig which would cast that
of a Cent-garde into the shade. The distinguishing
colour of his lappels is pink, and in the matter of
golden laco he is a perfect glow-worm. To gaze
upon the sheen of his white waistcoat is “alone
worth the price of admission; ” and there is a
whisper in equestrian circles that several Circas-
sian slaves are employed prior to his retiring to
rest, putting his beard in curl-paper.

The Donald Dinnie week concluded on
Monday night; and we are rather glad of this, be-
cause Donald is rather a bore, and painfully sug-
gestive, from his costume, of the snuff-shop. The
effect of Donald’s performance on us is to
lash us into a paroxysm of fury. For all we
care, Donald Dinnie’s 5001b. dumb-bell might
be stuffed with sawdust; and while he is exerting
himself with his Brobdignagian hammer, we al-
ways discover ourselves musingly wishing that he
would swallow it, take a pinch of snuff, and ex-
Slre. On Monday night Donald marched in about
alf-past eight, preceded by a piper and followed
by two other chieftains, who had apparently de-
serted their pedestals under cover of the darkness.
Dinnie is a fine-looking giant—being, in fact, a
man of remarkable thighs; and this may account,
in soma degree, for his popularity with the ladles!
Popularity with the ladies, by the bye, when
partaken of in moderation, is well enough.
The Rum says: “Hanlan’s advice to all who
wish to excel in athletic sports is, ‘ Keep
away from intoxicating liquors and tobacco.’ r ’
This makes us inclined to ask, with the disap-
pointed opera bouffe duchess, “Is that all?”
Dinnie, however, gives you the idea of a man who
takes very great care of himself; and it is reported
that where he boards they always keep the caul-
dron on, and have a sheep ready to drop in as occa-
sion may require.
• • •
F- The other portion of the performance is
of a high-class character, the bamboo business of
Cooma Kltchi beingincomprehensinle. One of the
most entertaining features, though, is the band,
who give you “ Annie Laurie ” in a succession of
demonsic blasts nightly, looking aloft in their red
coats like avenging demons—which, indeed, they
are. The Equesquiriculum moves into the suburbs
shortly, but, prior to its departure, Madame is
going to produce “The Liverpool Steeplechase”
on a scale of magnificence (sans doute) never be-
fore attempted. No one really should neglect to
go to the Circus while it is still here—if only for
this reason : one of their principal performers is
a prince in his own country, and his name is
Bungeroo.
* * * *
Last week we had “Moths,” by Leopold
Jordon, at the Gaiety. This week we have “ Moths,”
by H. Hamilton, Esq., at the Opera House. In
fact, the city stands a fair chance of being’ pretty
well supplied with moths before the present season
is oyer. We went to the Opera House on Monday
night, for we had seen Leopold Jordan’s adapta-
tion of the famous novel, and liked it. Of course,
wo wanted to see what a man like Hamilton could
do that Leopold had not done, Leopold assured us
that he could prove his adaptation was made be-
fore Hamilton’s. We believe this. They are not a
bit alike—not even a little bit. One thing is very
evident, also, which is that neither has stolen from
toe other. Leopold wouldn’t “ cadge,” of course;
but there’s no telling what Hamilton might
have done had he been given a chance to lay ruth-
less hands upon the work of Leopold. Had he
been an editor, now but, no; we will not call up
reminiscences of Spring poetry and the like, al-
though it is true that a waste-basket has its uses.Z

Miss de Grey Iplayed the heroine, Yere
Herbert. For this the author ought to thank her,
for she played it admirably and threw an
amount of feeling into the lines that fairly chained
and riveted the audience to her. We have not
always been exactly well pleased with Mi?s de
Grey’s acting, but as Vere Herbert she has our
undivided admiration. And let us tell you, too,
that this is the only character in which she has
looked really beautiful. She has looked pretty
enough in others, but as Vere she is simply beauti-
ful. We say this “ without fear of punishment or
hope of reward.” We’ve been attending the Free-
thought Convention. If you find any of our ideas
a little loose and wobbling, you’ll know what to
lay it to. Maggie Knight played this character for
Leopold Jordon, but—much as we love Maggie,
much as we’ve been loving her for all these years,
and much as we want to love her through the
years to come—we can’t compare her acting io
that of Miss de Grey. Anyway, comparisons are
odious, and, in the grammar of human anatomy,
we’re not in the comparative mood or degree or
something to-day, and don’t want to set a couple
of stage favourites to pulling hair.

Mr, A. T. Hilton’s Prince Zouroff was a
very clever representation of the part. He looked
the rough Russian fiend his linos made him out to
be. Bach time when the man beside us nudged us in
the ribs to keep us from snoring, we took a fresh
look at him and the Irish within us (we prefer
Scotch as a rule, hut there was none open) began
to assert itself. Then we vowed to bring a bouquet
loaded with dynamite next time and blow the head
of Prince Zour—off. Morton Selton took the part
of Correze, the opera-singer. If he had taken it to
New Guinea, we should have been better suited.
We thought Wybert Reeve was a failure as Correze,
and so he was; but he wasn’t the great, big, Mud-
gee-extension, underground-railway, Sir-Henry-
Parkes failure that Mort. Selton succeeded in
making of himself. Mr. Matt. Brodie, who played
at the Duke of Mull, was as uninteresting as a dead
kangaroo with its tail cut off. We don’t know
where Mr. Brodie learned to act; in fact, we don’t
believe he ever learned anywhere. If he did, we
would advise him to get as far away from that
school as he can and attend another—say, in Green-
land. The Esquimaux might teach him something.
Evidently the white people can’t.

Mr. Hamilton—better than any other Eng-
lish dramatist that we know of who has tried it—
has succeeded in reproducing an American female
character without scandalously over-doing the
manner of speech peculiar to the Down-Bast
Yankee. And yet Fuschia Leach (Miss Carrie
btewart) has some absurdly ridiculouslinestoread,
the like of which were never heard in America or
any where else, except on the stage or in a lunatic
asylum. Carrie Stewart looked about as much
like an American heiress as wo do in a bath-tub,

The Harmy recently had a “Hallelujah
Breakfast.” Says the Captlng in charge:—“On
Sunday, at 6.30 a.m., we went for a march before
we got our breakfast. People couldn’t make it
out. neither could the devil. There were 106 round
Father’s table for a hallelujah breakfast. The
table was spread with good things, the Bread of
Life in the centre, and was adorned with flowers—
the Lily of the Valley, the Rose of Sharon.” We
expect what surprised the poor devil met was
when he witnessed |tho “ wolfing.” A hallelujah
breakfast consists of new bread plastered with in-
different butter, eighteenpenny tea, and steak
which is convertible, at pleasure, into policemen’s
staves. Men and women snap up these viands in
large blocks, and, as in the case of the steamboat

We wonder whom his choice will fall upon this
time. Not “ W.” again, we suppose; though, from
the descriptive manner in which he accepted that
“good cigar,” we should say he would be great at
describing how the murderous shells, humming
through the air, fell crashing upon the doomed
city. Perhaps the Boss intends to go himself. Aha!
that would be good news, indeed! We can imagine
some of the first slip of his first despatch;—“'l he

Just now on account of cattle being allowed to go
through the streets. And only a short while ago
certain cows paid a visit to the graveyard, which
has been the cause (or should we say the cows!) of
a good deal of bitterness among the religious
bodies in Kempsey. It seems the cows went in to
mourn over the wrong denomination (they were
Wesleyan cows, we believe, but we don’t know
which sect owned the lot in which they were
caught), and the members of that denomination
naturally took it as a reflection upon their de-
ceased relatives—in other words, implying they
were calves. All this seems to us very foolish,
and we think missionaries should be sent to the
cows at once. Missionaries all know how to milk
their congregations.

“German Syrup.”—No other medicine in
the world has ever given such a test of its cura-

three years two million four hundred thousand
small bottles of this medicine were distributed
free of charge by Druggists in the United States of
America to those afflicted with Consumption,
Asthma, Croup, severe Coughs, Pneumonia, and
other diseases of the throat and lungs, giving the
afflicted undeniable proof that German Syrup will
cure them. The result has been that Druggists in
every town and village in civilized countries are
recommending it to their customers. Go to your
Druggist and ask what they know about it. Sample
Bottles 6d. Regular size, 3s. 6d. Three doses wil

This Is the usual formula of the farmer when
he comes Into a country newspaper office and

acknowledges the fact after this fashion;—“Mr.
Woodward, who keeps over 300 laying hens, sent
us four eggs, weighing over fourteen ounces. The
best part of the business is that those sent by Mr.
Woodward were to be sampled.” The tone of
triumph in this last sentence Is sorrowfully sug-

as playfulness, of these concluding words: “ Per-

It was in the Protestant Standard office,
and Zachary Barry was cutting out of the home
news scathers for the Scarlet Lady, in the shape of
items about censer-boys seeing the error of their
ways, and Jesuits’ parrots renouncing Rome, when
his eye lit on this paralyser: “ Lord Petre will take
his seat in the House of Lords during the Autumn
session. He will be the first Bonian Catholic priest
who has sat there since the Reformation.” “ Carry
me out,” said Zachary, In a feeble gasp; “I have
lived long enough. Boy!” An inkstalned youth
answered the summons, and, handing him a roll of
manuscript, Zachary covered his head with a dust-
cloth, and, pointing to his heart, cried In a hollow
voice, “ Strike! strike, boy, and do not fear I I
have done with the world!” But, as th© boy did
not strike, Zachary took the cloth from his head
again, and wiped his forehead with It. The cynical
eye of the youth was on him, however, and he
blushed—that reverend man —with confusion.
“Get out,” he growled, at last, “and bring me In

Seven Horns.” Which was all very well as a cover
for his retreat; but, as sure as Zachary Barry lives’

They had an elocutionary tournament at
Maitland a few days ago It was a cultured affair.
One of the pieces delivered was the oration of
Marc Antony over the dead body of Caesar. Here
we quote from the local paper:—“Mr. Lewis fol-
lowed. This gentleman evidently believes in real-
ism in art, for he brought out with him a large
railway rug, to which, on coming to the lines
‘ you all do know this mantle,’ he pointed with
solemn gesture.” This is delicious. Mr. Lewis is a
humourist of the first order. The first order of
humourists is chiefly composed of dead-house
keepers and drag manipulators. But this incident,
in its magnificent recklessness of anachronism, re-
minds us of one very similar which we saw in our
silad days. It was at an amateur theatrical per-
formance, and the company were playing “ Julius
Caesar.” They were chiefly young grocers and
d rapers with more of a turn for histrionics than for
history. For Instance their togas—bed-sheets—
were embellished on the back with large red
crosses, which gave the Idea that the wearers
hid been hired to walk about the town
advertising the Red Cross Jam Preserving
Company. The glory of the performance,
however, was the get-up of the youth who
played Caesar. He was a red-headed softgoods-
raan, and strode up to the base of Pompey’s statue
enveloped In majestic gloom and the red-cross
toga of the time. When he took his place at the
pedestal of the statue, and the dread moment
arrived when he was to die, the full force of his
gigantic joke burst upon us. He was bare-legged
from the middle of the thigh to the knee, and
from that down his legs were cased in Wellington
boots! He was'stabhed In seventeen places, and
died In his boots like a man and a Roman. But it
was too much, even for that unsophisticated auli-
enee. When his supposed dead body was humped
round again to be orated over by Marc Antony,
somebody throw an egg and hit it in the eye,
whereupon the corpse of mighty Csesar got up,
aad, shaking its fist at the audience, said it “would
be d-d if it would be made a target for them,”
and strode off in sullen gloom—which, of course,
h ur at up thd show, and the curtain was rung down
under a.destmotive fire of oranges, and amid a
noorm of yells. But, for all that, we should like
to gaze once upon Mr. Lewis and his railway rug.
Still, we nre in no hurry; It will be t-lnae enough
wh. n he is stuffed.

The Port Douglas (Q.) Times says sugges-
tively:—“Inspector Carr has come back from his
mixtion of vengeance. We do not think that the
settlers of the Daintree district will be troubled
again for some time to come, Mr. Carr having
tnoroughly dispersed the myalls.” Wo should like
to get some details about the Carr process of
myall dispersement.
We see that the old joke about Potiphar
has turned up again, after having been buried,
amid the execrations of an infuriated populace, in
the reign of George II. It has been resuscitated
by Alfred. Though, perhaps, it may not he new,
even to him, he would doubtless appreciate any
Pleasantry that was popular during the reign of
the House of Handover.
Quite true. “ It is pleasing to see,” says a
contemporary, “ that journalistic enterprise is go-
ing ahead in the far interior.” So it is. We have
heard hotel-keepers make the same remark many
a time when journalistic enterprise has gone ahead
in the shape of an apparition with a type-stick
and a billy-can black with age and crime, which it
had feebly offered as a substitute in payment for
two days’ board and a bottle of rum,
A Melbourne paper says a tremendous
stampede was caused around Creswiok by the
report that a lion of unnatural fierceness had
broken loose from the circus there and was kill-
ing everything in his way. Also, that people were
so afraid th <t they went to their work with loaded
guns on their shoulders. Also, that “the terrible
lion turned out to be a greyhound dog with a
cloth on.” Terrible lion I Terrible lyin’.
Listen! A Domain orator said, a Sunday
or two ago, that the Democratic Alliance would
be reformed on such a basis that neither Sir Henry
Parkes, David Buchanan, nor the gates of hell
could shake It. Can you guess it? No! Well,
now! Why, of course he meant that the Alliance
would be reformed on the basis of Nothing. We
should like to see what could shake that. Who
would care to, anyhow ? There are no river front-
ages in it.
“Look here! ” said Alfred to his manager
one day last week, and then he pointed to the fol-
lowing paragraph:—" Mr. Barnes’ microtome, sug-
gested by Messrs. Caldwell and Threfeld’s auto-
matic microtome, can cut sections the 6000th of an
inch In thickpees.” “Send for It at once!” said
Alfred. “ Why? ” enquired the manager, in a
tone of respectful surprise, “Why?” replied
Alfred, biting his thumb and glaring at the
manager, “ why, to cut the expenses down finer,
of course! ”
This item is for the ladies’ column. It is
from a country paper: “A fight took ulaoe towards
the finish of the fancy dress ball at Narrabri, and
one gentleman went home with a pair of black
eyes.” Quite chivalrous, Isn’t it ? It Is a pity that
these sort of things do not occur more frequently
at fashionable affairs In Sydney. But, when we
come to think of it, we blush to admit that we
ourselves have gone home with a pair of black
eyes from a ball before now. They belonged to
another person, however. It all depends upon that,
dear girls.
To show how some men esteem brazen
assertion above knowledge, we have an instance
of a N.S. Wales politician, whose strong suit Is
finance, and whoso reported speeches bristle with
figures. List to this. He had occasion to ex-
pound his views on great loans not long ago, and
got his calculations printed. He continually reads
decimals this way: 4’5, or4 7, or 5 3 per cent, are,
respectively, 4 and a fifth, 4 and a seventh, and
5 and a third I Here’s a man to aspire to a Trea-
surership, if you like.
Julian Thomas arrived at Wentwoiththe
other day, and some of the residents gave him a
banquet. This was very nice of them, and very
nice for Julian, and very nice for everybody.
Only the chairman, we think, was too grasping
He said in his speech at the conclusion that he
“regretted that similar gatherings were not more
frequent in Wentworth. That is, in other words,
he yearned for more Julians to feast. Well, he had
a greater appetite for glory than we had. One
Julian was enough for us. But then we are modest,
which, perhaps, makes all the difference.
The Bathurst Social Club have carried it
by one vote that “ the pen has been more instru-
mental in promoting the greatness of the British
Empire than the sword. When we remember
that Charles White, and Gloster Searle White, and
Dan Mayne, and Rae are all wielding pens In
Bathurst, we have no fear now of the disruption
of the Empire at this end, and would gladly see our
swords beaten into magnum-bonums and for-
warded to those mighty champions. It Is for this
reason we would look upon the abolition of the
defence vote with profound equanimity.
The Jews have just celebrated the Rosh
Oshosbono. Hushl hush I O, no—[None of that

fitted up for Adam, the descendants of Abraham,
and to contain John Davies, and gentlemen who
lend at 1700 per cent, to the Marcus Clarkes of the
Gentiles. We throw over geological cavils at such
a solemn time, and congratulate the earth on Its
antiquity, and the Jewish race cn its vitality; and,
to show our bona fldes, are quite prepared to sign
any number of bonds tor cash down on bills due
at the Rosh Osb-what-d’you-call-lt, when the year
11,388 comes round. We will positively not plead
for a renewal. Bat. alas, we may bo dead before

There is a sombre splendour about the
Cooktown Independent which has a wierd fas-
cination for us at all times. We may say that we
are most affected by It when the subject is foot-
bridges, or stray goats, or the great question of
“the dredge.” Listen to this about the latter;—
“We have no hesitation in denouncing the diver-
sion of the dredge to Townsville as an act contrary
to reason, justice, and honour.” There is courage
for you! There is dauntless chivalry I There is—
but, stay 1 May there not be some personal motive
under this fine language? Is it not possible—we

Horace Bent, “the Australian humourist and
comedian,” takes a benefit, to which his friends
are invited, at the usual prices per head. We
don’t know what Horace Is taking this benefit for,
but we imagine It’s for his health. It needs some

Thursday night was taken up with song
and smoke by the Metropolitan Liedertafel. The
old Masonic Hall was crowded, and the emphatic
way in which middle-aged, thin-haired, subdued-
looking men pounded the floor and rapped the seats
showed that years of domestic repression were
unable to entirely smother the buoyant demon-
strativeness of long ago. The persons of the
singers loomed large and Indistinct through the
haze of tobacco-smoke enveloping them Hallo-
well was there, and In fine fettle. He gave us,
among other things, the evergreen “Simon the
Cellarer’’ —that friend of our youth, who has done
more for the cause of Bacchus than all the scrib-
blers, from Anacreon to Tom Moore. There is an
E in “Simon”—whether above or below the lino
oretraddlelogs on it, we are unable to say just now
—and Hallewell trolled it out so effectively and re-
sonantly as to make those of us, who never got be-
low F sharp, anxious to rise In a body and destroy
him. Mr. Kodd, a tenor of the robust school, gave
“ My sweetheart when a boy,” and gave it wefl. It
is a suggestive song. Women at 30, It Is said, like
men at 40. It may be so: we cannot say. What
we can say Is that boys at 14 get hopelessly mashed
on women of 26 to 30. We were so ourselves; and
when, one day, a tall cavalry-man with blonde
moustache and sawdustbrains dropped down upon
our peaceful village and robbed us of our love, we
—but, enough. Mr. Plnsutl was well received. So
was M'Mahon, whose tone and tongueing on the
cornet filled a long-felt want. Some part-songs
were given by the members in a manner credit-
able to themselves and their Instructor, Herr
Ai P©n. The Herr accompanied during the even-
ing. The entertainment marked the close of the
Metropolitan Lledertafel’s first year's existence—
so, with a hearty “ good speed" on our lips, we
wandered into the night air, ricocheted off a Sal-
vationists’ meeting, and sidled home.
In spite of determined opposition, Rad-
cliff and Blta filled the old Masonic Hall on Friday.
The rain was the opposition. The programme was
varied In some particulars, but there was no vari-
ation in the applause. It was just as deafening as
ever. While Madame was giving the “Carnival
of Vensle” you could have hoard the friction of a
sunbeam. When she was done you couldn’t have
heard a bullock-driver’s oath. And Radclitf?
Well, we intend to hear him once more before we
launch out into a treatise on the flute and flute-
players from the time of Tubal Cain.

Remenj, the great Hungarian violinist,
who is regarded as not yielding the position of the
world’s best violinist even to Joachim, passed
through Sydney this week, and was for severs!
days the guest of Max Vogrich. for whoso talent
Remenj has the highest estimation. He says that
Australians have not realised the sort of musician
they possess in Vogrich. At a llttie recital in a
private circle a few nights ago, the two at lists co-
operated, and kept a number of connoisseurs en-
tranced for several hours. In several pieces,
Remenj literally “ played ” the music; in a
mfnuetto of Mozarts, especially, tacitly chal-
lenging Vogrich to a game of musical romps,
to which the latter responded with quick and
able appreciation, the great violinist’s tour
de caprice being watched by the other artist
with keen enjoyment, and retorted with charming
Aplomb. Nothing resembling this bit oi musical
gaiety has ever, so far as we know, been attempted
In public. Remenj says that among living pianists,
Vogrich is, besides Liszt, the only one whom he
has found capable of entering extempore into this
musical caprice, and responding with his instru-
ment to the va ru ries committed by himself on the
violin. Rube 1 ‘tcin could, when prepared and on
his guard, cate , on; but when taken off-hand, he
lost the run o f be humour, and his share of the
extemporization was not maintained.

And left her In a corner:

Talking of little Warner, we wonder when he is

with, when the glory of being her equestrian cava-
lier was only to last one season ? Oh, and Jessie

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS
Tom Ray, of Ulverstone, has again cleared
13ft. with the pole.
Nearly £100 was subscribed for the Ken
professionals who played against Australia at Can
terbury.
Two gentlemen met. One remarked to
the other, “ That looks an A1 dog of yours.’
“ Not at all, he’s not Al; he’s K9.”
“Roadster,” in the Australasian, speaks
very highly of the Sydney Bicycle Club, which, he
says, is the richest in the colonies.
The fastest 5-mile record for sculling is
Hanlan’s 3Jmin. rowed alone. The fastes
for a race, Josh Ward’s 35min. lOsec.
The championship of the Portsmouth
ladies’ swimming club has been won oy a fair crea-
ture who swam 88 yards in Imin. 13sec.
A match for the benefit of George Avery
an old Blackburn rover, “ who is going to Austra-
lia,” has been played at Blackburn, England.
The battered bit of red leather which de-
feated the Australians at Canterbury, has been
encircled by a silver band and presented to Lady
Harris.
A 32-lb. wild-oat was pitted against three
bull-dogs in succession, at Coal Valley, W.Va., on
2nd August, and killed them in llmln., 7min., and
13mln. respectively.
At Camus Rectory, near Strabane, eleven
ladles have played a cricket match against eleven
gentlemen. The former used bats, and the latter
broomsticks. The ladies won by one wicket.
A race for 2000 dollars “was rowed by
Teenier and Wallace Ross, on the East River, New
York; and after a desperate race, the dollars were
pursed by Teemer, who won by half a length only
The Norman Bicycle Club (Vic.), in their
coming races have made it compulsory for riders
to wear white pants, aud cap ana jacket of ditfer-
oat colours—such as yellow jacket and black cap,
tor instance.
At a dog-fight for 2500 dollars and gate-
money, at Long Island City, one dog killed the
other after two hours’ fighting; and, on a second
pair being put into the pit, one was taken out dead
in fifty minutes.
John Dempsey and George Fulljames
fought with skin gloves for 2000 dollars. Twenty-
two rounds were got through in 38 minutes,
Dempsey winning from the start. Youth and
weight must be served.
F. Archer heads the list of winning jockeys
this English racing season with 170 firsts out of 378
mounts; next in order come C. Wood, 84 out of
320; 8. Loates, 51 out of 281; T. Cannon, 40 out of
149; J. Osborne, 34 out of 140.
At the Australia v. All England match,
five shillings was charged at the stand for a seat
on a hard form without any back, and without any
covering from a scorching sun. The charge for a
covered stand was ten shillings.
“Ignoramus” wrote to the DaIlt News,
recommending (1) that fresh wickets be provided
for each innings, (3) the institution of four-day
matches in cases of national importance, and f3)
the commencement of play at 10 a.m.
Sam Yates, on behalf of the employees of
the Bun paper, on July 32nd, presentee Harry
Taxter, its superintendent, with a set of fishing
tackle valued at 100 dollars. We wonder if he will
ever land 100 cents worth of fish with it.
Sir Modred’s dam is expected shortly to
foal to Apremont, and there is now at Middle Park
a very handsome yearling daughter of hers by
Apremont. To the latter Welcome Jack's
dam, Miss Flat, foaled a filly a few days back.

“To ‘the Surrey Crowd.’
“Shame, Sirs I When victory fails to crown our
banner-,
Bad cricket is not mended by bad manners! ”
Mr. Lueker, of Melbourne, is credited with
having laid wagers on the Melbourne Cup amount-
ing to £21,000. He made 31 wagers, eacb £1000, lay-
ing from 1000 to 30 down to 1000 to 1. He mignt
make a pile at it, but it is hard to see where it is to
come in.
We have a “ dark ’un ” who can pull Beach
anyway, for anything, from an obliterated postage
stamp up to a million sterling. We know you
won't spoil the plant if we tell you his name, so
here goes to let you into a certainty—it’s “John
Detble.”
“ Pendragon” writes in the Referee that
Myers, the American amateur, who is alleged to
have run 440 yards at Birmingham In 48 3-5soc., can
have from him an/ amount of money he and his
party like, from £1 to £1000 that he cannot repeat
the record in question.
Mr. E. Q. Griffith, one of the oldest of New
Zealand sportsmen, and the importer of, amongst
other animals, Sir Modred’s dam Idalla, and Som-
nus’s dam Hammock, has started an agency at
Christchurch for the sale and purchase of tho-
roughbred horses and mares.
At Bally haunis racecourse (Ballyhaunis is
In county Mayo), recently, a circumstance almost
phenomenal in racing and chasing annals occurred
In a mare and her colt each winning races at t e
same meeting. '1 he mare was Dame Durden, the
colt Crichton, and they are the property of Captain
Boycott, the original ooycottee.
The only 60-inch rider in Melbourne came
a “ howler,” the other day, and, when spitting
out tho broken pieces of pipe-stem that had lodged
half-way down his throat, was sympathised with
by a bystander, who remarked, "Be gad! you
take it mighty aisy, spitting out yer teeth with
divll a wince; y’re a plucky lad, by my sowl.”
The American horse Parole has at last
retired from the turf, after a long and successful
career, during which he twice visited England.
He was nine successive years on th« turf, crossing
the Atlantic twice, and started in 130 races, of
which ho won 59, was second in 23, third in 14, and
unplaced in 28—winning $82,233 for bis enterprising
owner.
Private A. Robertson, 1st Scottish Rifles,
won the rifle championship of the British Army
at Wimbledon, with a total score of 115 points at
200, 500, 800, and 1000 yards.
At the Crystal Palace on 6th August, H.
J. Webb, of the London Tricycle Club, rode 100
miles in 6h. 43min. on a tricycle, beating all
previous records from 25 miles upwards.
No match has yet been made between the
aquatic terrors of the Lands and Treasury. The
backers of the “Jungle” (the money representa-
tive) completely crushed their earthy opponents
by the amount of their challenge. The reason of
their confidence is that the “Jungle” is in grand
condition from doing six hou-s a day pulling a go-
cart with a 20-inch-square baby in it.
Jamieson, the home champion in the Cum-
berland and Westmoreland style of wrestling, is a
man of immense muscular strength. He weighs
over 18st„ and is so powerful in the arms that he
can lay down any ordinary man just by drawing
him in to him; and men who have had the pleasure
of a hug from him say that he could crush in the
ribs, like a bear, if he chose to exert his full power.
Brain’s 100 against Australia in the Glou-
cestershire match was the tenth hundred hit olf
our men’s bowling as against two hundreds made
for them this season. However, it must not be
forgotten that in the match just referred to the
Australians had, in Gloucestershire’s second in-
nings, a wet ball to bowl and field—a serious dis-
advantage.
Fishermen in America are cursing their
want of luck this season, and put it all down to tho
number of actors, variety and legitimate, who are
bobbing for what they can get, their own business
having come to an end earlier this year than usual.
Most of these actors, in their inexperience, have
been baiting with custard rolls and ice-creams, and
have completely vitiated the taste of the average
fish.
Archer reported Morgan for foul riding in
one of the races at Kempton (Eng.), and the latter
jockey, on being brought before Lord Alington,
Sir P. Johnstone, and Lord Marcus Beresford, was
let off with a reprimand. Archer himself has ere
now got home under most desperate circumstances,
and there are plenty of racegoers who look upon
him as one of the last to think of the means so the
desired end be obtained.
Thus the Wobi/d :—“ The names that have
been mentioned in connection with the team to
visit Australia at the end of our season ought not
to give satisfaction. It is essentially a Players
team, and therefore, the two gentlemen who are
to be included, as is stated, are out of place.
Whilst so much is said in England about money
being tho object of the Antipodean cricketers, we
should be doubly careful ourselves.”
In the last international match the Eng-
lishmen scored faster than the Australians. It is
worthy of note, among the] many singular things
that this match has shown us, that all through the
England innings there was a left-handed batsman
at one end. Scotton went in first, and was out
ninth, and on his retirement Peate joined Bead.
This was a circumstance, if not withoutprecedent,
at any rate, almost unexampled in recent years.
John Wilson has a circus performance afr
the Westminster Aquarium, London, where he
makes a speciality of bucking and high-jumping
Australian hordes. It speaks volumes, by the way,
for the “Health” Exhibition, that that show
should have so interfered with the attendance at
the Aquarium, where the Phrynes and Aspasias of
London ordinarily congregate, that the Aquarium
directors, for the first time during years, should
find themselves unable to declare a dividend.
We have it on good authority that there is
at the present time, in the police force of Sydney,
a man who should be able to put down, Cumber-
land style, any man to be found in the colonies.
He ranked high in the old country, but does not
care to make a splash here until he finds a foe and
money worth tackling. Could not something be
done to bring Blackburn and him together ? The
gate-money tor a real good match would be
worth something considerable. It would be a
“ throw ” in for the man who won.
Despite the wind, that tried to extract
amusement from turning important garments
inside out, the Moonee Valley races passed olf suc-
cessfully on Saturday. The course is a small one,
but is very neat, well laid out, and looked after.
There were six events, and money was free, the
favourites as a rule justifying the trust reposed in
them. In the Steeplechase, Mr. Martin’s Alhambra,
a promising young horse, fell and broke his back;
on the metropolitan courses it is generally the
“ backers ” who fall and get broke.
The cyclists’ camp recently held at HarroJ
gate, was, judging from the tricycllst’s accouqt, a
signal success. Fifty-four tents were erected.
Various were the titles assigned by the occupants
to their domiciles. There was the “Swe»t P
Villa;” two thistles were planted outside, and a
very small turf into which were stuck two dilapi-
dated roses forming the garden, rbove which
figured a gigantic inscription: “Please to keep off
the grass,” “ Do not pluck the flowers.”
This is almost equal to a snake story“ A
young man bathing in a creek below Moncton,
N.B., was chased to land by a shark three to four
feet long. A stick being thrust towards it, the
fish seized it in its teeth, when it was drawn upon
the beach and killed.” Now we don’t feel sur-
prised at even a shark taking a stick in his drop of
water, but what we do stick at is the shark hold-
ing on to the stick until he was hauled out of the
briny for one of the fellows to stick; but, then,
we are such sticklers for truth, you know.
At the annual meeting of the members of
the Warwick Cricket Club, Mr. H. H. Hiddlestone
carried away the President's trophy for the highest
batting average; his figures amounted to 37 7 for
all match's. Mr. James Kellick’s trophy for high-
est individual score, and Mr. J. Cullen's for highest
aggregate score, both fell to Mr. A. Gregory. Mr.
J. Davis was the recipient of Mr. D. Oirllvle's prize
for the greatest number of double-figure scores.
Mr. D. Ogllvie carried off both Club and President’s
trophies for best bowling average; and Mr. W. J.
Clarke’s trophy for best fieldsman was awarded to
Mr. J. Rigg.
At Southampton they have a lovely ceme-
tery surrounded by a delightful racecourse, and in
old days the blending of the Burial Service with
“The field a pony” was, if not pretty, at least
effective. But all things have ah end, and when
at the funeral of a most charming lady, when
every head !was bowed with trrief and sobs rent
the air, the chief mourner and widower was seen
to solemnly climb over the cemetery rails and
baggie >yi{.p $ bookmaker for 5 to 4, when that
worthy would only offer evens, Southampton
arose as one man and put a stop to that merry
meeting'.
Here’s a chance for some of our all-round
men to pick up a soft £500. Mr. Wallace Rodgers,
in the Spouting LifB of 12th August) says "he
would like to make one match before he retires
from athletic circles, and is willing to shoot at 100
pigeons, play 1000 up at English billiards, and swim
half a mile in open water (sea for preference)
against any amateur or professional) for a oup
and a bet, if desired, of not more than £500. If

ment for the colonies.
It has always been a puzzle to properly
handicap the contestants in a tea-kettle race, which
is one between steam yachts. The latest system
devised Is this. The velocity of a steam yacht is
assumed to be as the cube root of the quotient of
the product of the area of her grate surface, and
the constant due to the character of combustion
divided by the cube root of the square of her
gross tonnage, and subtracted from the number of
firemen scalded or ruptured. This method is so
simp'e that a child can calculate to a fraction what
the Ena can allow Potts and Paul’s iron horse-
trouglj with the stove-pipe in it.
In the first innings of Gloucester in a match
against Notts, commenced on July 31, Shaw took
eight wickets for 29 runs. He was in particularly
11 e form with the ball, and besides achieving the
hat trick by sending back Townsend, Painter, and
Page with consecutive balls, he nearly repeated
the feat in dismissing Fairbanks, Boughton. and
Francis with four successive balls. The veteran
Norts bowler’s analysis tor the innings—eight
wickets at a cost of three and five-eighth runs per
wicket—can worthily be placed beside many of
his other phenomenal exhibitions. In the second
innings he again performed the hat trick.
The exhibition of trotting-horses at Moore
Park drew together a good attendance, considering
the day of the week. The style shown by the
horses satisfied most persons, and therois no doubt
that the promotion of trotting is a step in the right
direction. If a horse is not good enough for
racing, he is good enough for work, and that is
more than can be said of nags bred for galloping—
ai a rule, they are useless weeds, fit only for the
one thing, that is, to carry a light weight for a
short distance. Another benefit of the trotter is
that hie owner can get some use and amusement
out of him when not engaged in actual racing
work.
The Melbourne Cricket Club have held
their annual meeting, and presented a very credit-
able account of this year s work. The roll con-
tains now 1673 members. The net receipts for the
year were £4529 10s. lOd. Some reverses were ex-
perienced, the burning of the grand stand affect-
ing the intentions of the Club considerably. A
resolution was adopted at the meeting authorizing
a loan of £10.000 to be raised for the new grand
stand and other improvements. During the year,
the senior eleven of the Club plaved 47 matches,
with a result of 18 wins and 23 draws; and the
junior eleven played 66 matches, with 31 wins and
24 draws.
When Kaiser Wilhelm goes on a “sport-
ing ” expedition, the guests are carefully selected,
their capacity for riding or shooting being entirely
secondary to their place in the order of preced-
ence, or in the service of the Crown. Everything
is regulated by precedent, and the directing func-
tionary knows at least the correct number of birds
or beasts which ought to fall to the share of each
person present. Hence—owing to the discipline
which controls everything in Deutschland—it in-
* ariably happens that the Kaiser is most success-
ful in bringing down game, and the other great
personages lucky in something like a ratio to
their rank.
The annual contest for the English long-
distance swimming championship (course, from
Putney Bridge to Charing Cross Railway-bridge,
5-Mmdes), took place on 9th August, and attracted
seven competitors—amongst whom were Itter, the
holder, A. F. Bettinson, and G. Bell, who had all
distinguished themselves in previous contests. So
far as the expected tight between the holder and
Boll was concerned, the spectators were in no way
disappointed. Both men swam splendidly. Boll
avenged his defeat of last year. His fine stamina
enabled him to keep in front of liter nearly all the
way. Winner’s time, 1 hour lOmin. Itter was
59sec. behind.
A most remarkable accident occurred to
Shawer’s horse Haddington, by imp. Hadding-
ton out of Prairie, Flame who, while running in a
mile-heat race at Grass Valley, California, on July
5th, brose both his hind legs at the pasterns,
through making too short a turn; and the poor
brute stood on the stumps until shot. This re-
minds us of h still more remarkable case that
occurred in New South Wales. A young fellow
was can ering along slowly on a soft, level piece of
road, when he found his horse go suddenly lame,
and on jumping off to see what was the matter,
was astounded to And that the cannon bone of the
hear fore leg had broken.
Jack Bourke, of England, had four rounds,
Queensberry rules, with Mike Cleary, the contes-
tmts to divide the gate money. The place was not
crowded, as it was reported that the slogging was
not for “ blood ” but for science only, and as no
great damage was done, it looks as if they were
right in their conjectures. Anyhow, Bourke
proved himself far and away the best man, playing
all over Cleary like a hall-storm. Cleary tried hat d
to get his heavy right in, but was stopped easily
by Bourke, who only used his left for hitting—in
fact, he was so superior that Cleary seemed quite
cowed. Old England is still able to produce a good
'un, even if she cannot reach quite to the top of
the tree.
Billy Madden, proprietor of Madden’s
Athletic Hall, New York, has announced that he
will give five handsome gold medals for the ama-
teur boxing champions ac different weights. The
affair is open to all amateurs, no entrance fee
charged, and Charles Mitchell will act as referee.
Lightweights not over 1401b.; middle-weights not
over 1581b.; heavy-weights will be shakebags, no
limit. The affair will be conducted under exactly
the same rules as those employed by Madden in
England, when Mitchell won tbe championship. A
number of pros, will also oblige. We should like
to see our amateur who made such a show of the
pros, during the Miller-Foley combination take a
hand in this little deal.
The North Bendigo cricket club met one
night last week, and gave them'selvFs nwav in the
direction, of big potatoes. The glorification was
I P°£ without cause, however, as their first eleven
naa only one defeat chalked up against It for the
last year. Among the new rules they drew up at
the meeting was one whldh regulates the number
of ladies each member may bring with Him to the
grand-stand. Owing to the exigencies of shtlcei
the number is fixed at two. This decision mat-
meet the oifflculty, but we think a surer principle
to go upon would have been that of measurement.
Obviously, all ladles are not equally—. But.
better give the new rule a trial. This would not
have suited Brigham Young.
The Jackson and Farnan affair ended in a

An excellent case of “the biter bit” oo
curred at a country town, some little time since
a butcher backed a man to run another for <£ao!
and, as he was known to have little or no chance
of course any amount of money was about to lay
against him. The smart butcher then squared the
opposition ped., and got over £300 on his man i but,
k® k.Pew there would be a row and cries ot
swindle, refused to lay a penny unless tha
money was down. This was done, and-ohl crUel
rate—the other man ran square , winning by any
distance [as he Hiked. Harry Rickards’ “Mad
Butcher was nothing to our lively friend’s per-
formance. The ped., however, made himself scarce
as soon as possible, for fear he might be cut out of
iuiur6 events.
wi ? d * u P made of a glove-
fight between J. P. Cow, of Denver, and G. A.
Morrison, of Leadvllie, for the championship of
Colorado. There were about 300 present, and the
fighting was very rough. Clow at last began to
get the best, of It, and Morrison hung on his neck,
and refusing to let go, got some terrible uppei?
onH 9 +t rom A ® cene of confusion ensued,
and the crowd rushed the ring; one man struck
Clow over the ropes, and got it on the nose in re-
turn. Some of Clow’s friends then attacked him.
and a regular free fight ensued, and Sheriff Graham
and his force of men at last got things quiet. The
tmng would have been a regular slaughtering
match, had not the sheriff disarmed all the specta*
tors before he allowed the fight to begin.

with our present cowardly style of mobbing and

honourably according to recognised rules would

Several of the Australian team are now
strange to say, rather in love with W. G. Grace’
who, for apparently well-defined reasons, has been
by no means popular in the past. Thev sav that
they like W.G. better than anyone they have met
in England; that he is a keen sportsman, but a fair
and most manly antagonist, and one who only
needs to be known well to be thoroughly admired
Hut thisdidn't prevent Murdoch. Spoil, Bleckham’
and several others getting out of their little beds at
tho Tavistock Hotel early on the morning of the
third day of the big All-England match to prav
that there might be a deucedly damp wicket—not
too damp, however, for gate-money—for “tho
Doctor and their other English friends. Spoil
and Palmer, in particular, made their orisons most
devoutly on this head, but the prayers of the
wicked availeth not.
While the Hon. Alfred Lyttelton was en-
gaged in the exhilarating task of fielding against
Murdoch and M’Donnell, on the first day of the
last great All-Rnaiand match, an individual rr-
speotably-attlred, with an elaborate brown mous-
tache, called at his residence, saying that he had
just come from Mr. Lyttelton’s chambers at the
toe Temple, and that as Mr. !>• bad been summoned
from the cricket field to £0 down to West Sussex
for the purpose of making a gentleman’s will, he
wanted bis great coat and umbrella at once. After
some hesitation, the servant gave up those articles
to him, whereupon, armed with Mr. Lyttelton’s
coat and gingham, he proceeded to Lord Harris’
house, and succeeded, under another pretext in
obtaining possession of a coat of hislordshlp’s of a
more sporting character. “ It his hard.” writes Mr
Lyttelton, “ that our households should be strip-
ped while we toll, In however humble an arena,
for the nation.” ’
All boating men will be glad to hear that
our old friend, Will. Johnson, the late owner of
Lizzie, is once more restored to hi« usual health.
Mr. Johnson had a very severe attack of paralysis
in the right arm, but a trip into the country has
put him all straight again. We hope to see him in
command of a good boat soon, as he is too constant
and valuabie a man to drop out of aquatics. And,
by the bye, wc see that a young daughter of his,
not yet 16 years of age, has done a first-class llke-
nessof Beach. The picture Is 1 fe-size, and is un-
mistakable—the determined look and stolid face
being well defined. The drawing Is one any ama-
teur might bo proud of, and when it is known that
the young lady has never even seen Beach, it is the
more seeing creditable she has succeeded so well
with nothing to guide her but a small photo. We
also notice that Mr. Johnson's son, 9 years, won a
silver cross ftt his school sports for a race run by
boys under 11 years of age.
Years ago a very shrewd personage was
travelling in a railway carriage, and as the train
sped on to the race meeting for which the travellers
were bound, he, with much apparent carelessness,
played with the tassel of the window-blind.
Alter a time he ceased; but presently the conver-
sation turned-perhaps he turned it-to carriage-
fittings, and he expressed a wonder as to the
number of threads in a tassel. Various guesses
length he made a bet on tho
subject. He was prepared to take odds he could
guess, or at least nearer than anyone present;
and, money being staked, he guessed that there
were twenty-one. “Under twenty, certainly," a
man opposite declared, and on this more bets were
made. When counted, it appeared that there were
nineteen. The first speculator had, In fact, care-
fully counted, and the second, suspecting the trick,
bad, when observed, dissembled, and with eouai
care cut off a couple of the threads.
Donald Dinnie has been giving it rather
roughiy to Miller in the Australasian; he says:
lor athletic contests throughout the world,
records show that I have won over 7500 contests,
and the Professor cannot give records of gaining
one-twentiuth of that number. I will wrestle, lift
hlfi 11 w d3e^i 9 ’i/^L I l ov, l heavy and light hammers, put
heavy and light stones, throw half-cwts., toss the
caber, dance, play fbe violin, run and leap; lam
prepared, by a substantial deposit in your hands,
to match any man breathing at either of the eight
contests singly. Some athletes depend more on
newspapers for their name than on the perform-
ances they accomplish. I have been now 31 years
before the public as an athlete, but in Great
Britain athletes get up their names only by deeds,
and not by meanly courting the press for flatter-
ing reports of their performances. In conclusion,
i®* me state that my money is still waiting to back
Mr. Thomas or myself to wrestle any man in Aus-
tralia lor any reasonable sum.- Yours, &c., Donald
DINNIK.
Summing things up, in a king article, the
Standard coolly says that “ average English bats-
men are the equals, If not the superiors, ot any
pic/fed players who can be sent from Australia;”

bowling, together with a Verve, decisiveness, and

promptltude in fielding is due to the Australians;
that the typical English bowler, say Peate, while
mechanically perfect, yet “lacks the art to con-
ceal art,” and puzzle the batsman as to ihe inten-
tion of the delivery; while the ileal bowler,
“Spofforth, seems to have this control of appear-
ances -it is impossible to tell by his action or ex-
pression what ho means to do, or how he means
to do it.” Which, we hope, is not intended to con-
vey the vile insinuation that “ Spoff's ” face is
vacant and expressionless. “ Palmer excels them
all in one important particular; he is that is to
say, one of the few men who can bowl with a break
from the on and a break from the off, it being
common with him to send a ball on the leg that
will break on the wicket. This perfection of skill,
reducing cricket to the exactness of feneing or
billiards, is the result only of cultivation such as
our Australian cousins have evidently brought to
bear on the game.”
Gall! At the “Old Stagers” amateur
theatricals, held at Canterbury during the cricket
week, our dear friend. Lord Harris, came forward,
while over his head a red banner, with the word
“ Invicta ” inscribed en it, was held by two of his
eompanions in the field, and delivered a few lines,
concluding—
“ Farewell, Australia! Now we've fairly licked her,
Bhe’U bear us witness, Kent is still * Invicta ’.”
Then there was sung a song—
“All hall who enter here,
The gallant Kentish crew;
They’ve got the bats, they’ve got the fields,
They’ve got the bowlers, too;
The match of ’84
Has wiped out ’83,
And Kent has proved that she can beat Australia.”
A day or two later, the ’ead of the ’Ouse of ’Arris
was on view at Kennlngton Oval, flielding for
Murdoch, M'Donnell, and Scott, in the All-England
match. “ ’Off's yer poor feet, my lud ? ”
The following statement of the batting
and bowling averages of the Australian Eleven in
England are compiled from all matches played up
to and Inclusive of the last match v. All-England:—
* Bowled 114 no-balls. + Bowled 4 no-balls and 1

“Pendragon” writes, apropos of the row
at the Australian's v. Players’ match “I have
reason to know that an account, more or less
coloured, was wired away at once to Australia, in
the interests of those who thirst to repay the Eng-
lish Press for what it said about the ‘ larrikin
outrage’ upon some members of a team which
visited Australia a few years ago. Let us hope this
account did not state that the demonstration was
directed wholly and solely against the Australian
cricketers. That, as everybody knows who knows
anything about Oval arrangements, it certainly
was not. It was not directed against anybody in
particular; if there was any direct feeling shown,
it was shown, and that most decidedly, against the
Surrey executive Professionals
though the Australians be, and amateurs as the
Surrey Clubmen are by virtue of their being
Surrey Clubmen, we do not find that the Austra-
lians have been allowed any pecuniary advantage
in the dealings which have taken place between
them. Nor can any one else who has had business
relations with the Surrey Club conscientiously say
that its executive is ever prepared to lose sight of
the main chance, or give up its hold on the loaves
and fishes. O, yes; the secretary ordered that no
money should be taken at the gates after the ad-
journment tor luncheon on the 1st inst. I have
received what purports to be a piece «f evidence
as to this order, and so shall be glad to know from
the secretary himself whether it was sent out be-
fore the trouble began, or was merely one of the
results of the trouble. There is unfortunately no
reason to doubt that the desire for gate-money is
far too widespread among athetic clubs generally,
and is, in a variety of ways, singularly destructive
of the true sportsmanlike spirit.”
In view of the fact that the London Press,
to a paper, stated on the day before the match that
the English team was a thoroughly representative
One, and that the home side should win, the follow-
ing letter—a fair specimen of much current litera-
ture on the subject—addressed to the Morning
Post, will be read with interest. The Italics are
ours:—“ If England had had a proper representa-
tive eleven, we should have either won the match
or made it a draw considerably in our favour. The
worst choice in such a match was Lyttelton. How
can he be in form, scarcely having pl'yed for two
years, and sitting in the vitiated atmosphere of the
Law Courts nearly all the year? He, unfortunate! v.
gave Murdoch a life at 46, which cost us nearly 170
runs. Bherwin would h <ve taken the opportunity
easily. Why are not cricketers taught the art of
catching and fielding? This would be quite as
valuable as so oyer-much batting at the nets. Had
our men held the catches given them, wo should
have won at least five or six matches from the
Australians that we have lost. Why are not the
representative, elevens of All-England selected by
a proper committee, and not left to three men, as
was the case in the last match-viz., to two of the
Walkers and a Mr. Burbidge? Lord Harris never
ought to have played. We throw our matches
away by sheer mismanagement. This one hears on
all sides—Yours, &c., Fair Play.” The ingenu-
ous writer forgets that he can’t eat his cake and
have it, too. Lyttelton’s bowling was most ;effec-
tive, even if his fielding wasn’t perfect. Ho got
four wickets for about 30 runs, whereas the other
six wickets cost 530 runs or thereabouts. England
had her best men, otherwise she’d have been licked
into a cocked hat. You can’t get more than eleven
men into a team it’s all very fine to talk about
the advantage enjoyed by the Australians in play-
ing together so continuously; but, suppose Mur-
doch had had all the talent of the colonu-s to pick
from as he went along during the tour, what could
he not have done at times when several of his men
were stale and not fit to play for sour apples ?
Murdoch’s score in the last great match
was the highest ever totalled in a contest of similar
importance. So far as can be made out, the Aus-
tralians, goaded on by the plentiful crop of news-
paper sneers, had made up their minds to polish
off John Bub decisively; while Grace, Harris, and
Co. had sworn by ah the gods that they’d wipe the
floor with the carcase of the Australian kangaroo.
Biackham, when met on the day before the match
and asked “ how things were going to go ?” said,
‘we’ll give them an almighty hiding if we have
anything like fair luck. We always lick ’em at the
Oval.” When interrogated as to “ Why at the
Oval?” the great wicket-keeper could only say
that the surroundings of the place seemed to suit
him and his colleagues better than the rose-scented
atmosphere of Lord’s. “ Yes,” repeated Black-
ham, screwing up one eye, “ I know we shall lick
’em at the Oval.” It is no secret that, notwith-
standing the prevalence of such delicate atten-
tions as the supply of hot-house grapes and soda
and “ fizz ” ad lib on big match-days—just think
of Midwinter dealing with an old-china plate of
hot-house grapes!—most of the members of the
team don’t now-a-days feel by any means at home
in England. They have all come to be regarded as
professional cricketers in the English sense of the
term, and there is consequently a lack of those
domestic hospitalities which in days of yore did so
much to make things pleasant all round. The big
match was a crucial one—for, had our men not
done something huge, they would for ever have
lost their reputation, and been condescendingly
spoken of by such blue-blooded rags as the
Standard and Globe as “ a—aw—fair game for a
- aw—country team.” In fact, the former paper
even now cannot conceal its mortification at the
exhibition made by Murdoch, M’Donnell, and Scott
of the English bowling, for it coolly remarks that
“such performances go far towards reinstating the
Australian Eleven as a first-class team!” Aw! The
London papers, as a whole, did their level best to
prove that the “draw,” far from being a moral
defeat, was really a victory for England; but the
Daily News, which, taken all round, is more im-
partial than its fellows, alludes in a sub-article to
the “cricketers of England (an England far from
merry, alas! after this affsvir of the Australians!)”
In New York the “great” six-day walking
match has been brought to an end. It was at first
intended for a trial of endurance between Charles
Rowell, the English walker, and Patrick Fitzger-
ald, an Irishman by birth, and an alderman by pro-
fession in the little town of Long Island.’city, near
New York. But a dozen men finally entered, and
public interest was greatly excited, especially as
Rowell, who had been announced as a sure and
easy * inner, was passed by his chief rival midway
in the race, then came within a few miles of over-
taking him, and was at last beaten by only eight
miles The Irishman made the remarkable record
of 610 miles, as follows: First day, 136; second, 100;
third, 110; fourth, 111%; fifth, 88%: sixth, 73%. His
best previous record was made in 1881, and was 583
miles in six days. He has also a record for short-
distance running of 11 miles in 59min. 50%sec., the
beat in the States. He is an odd-looking, ill-built,
round-shouldered, and stooping fellow, 38 years
old, and weighing before the race 1651b. One of
the competitors was a young Indian from the Far
West, a finely-made half-savage, with every ap-
pearance of strength, whose confidence in his own
powers was great. But he almost at once dropped
to the tail of the string of walkers, and gave out
long „efore the close.
The members of the Sydney Amateur
Canvas Dingy Club held their opening seance at
Ciomorne, on Saturday last. Notwithstanding the
inclemency and uncertainty of the weather, they
and their friends mustered to the number of about
eighty. The steamer Prince of Wales carried the
visitors, the bulk of the members going over in
their own canvas bags. The commodore, like
other great men, scorned to be in time, so kept all
hands waiting for a solid hour. Among the boats
present we noticed Olivette, Latona, Maggie,
Fedora, E-tella, Grand Flaneur, CarloUa, Raven,
Undine and Ettle. On taking our seats at the
groaning table, we thought the captain of the
German warship had been secured for chairman,
and had come in full uniform, bar the swabs. On
a second glance, however, we discovered that the
elaborate uniform clothed the sylph-like form of
J. J. Richardson, Esq., who is not only commander
but absolute owner of a perfect fleet of sailing and
steam vessels. The dinner was a great success,
and after the speech-making a very nice finish was
made by the presentation of a neat address and
massive diamond locket to Mr. Herbert Downs,
the hard-working hon. sec. Some of the sailors are
wonderful trenchermen—one lad was shovelling in
the prog with a broad-bladed knife, which he filled
from point to handle. If he can only bail out as
skilfully, there is no dingy in the hart our that
would fill under him.
On 11th August, the day that the great
Australia v. All-England match commenced, the
weather in London was desperately hot. The chief
end of the average man was to sit down and drink
something with ice in it. Sunstrokes were plenti-
ful, yet at the Oval black belltoppers and black
coats were de rigueur- for “ all Englishmen believe
that perspiration and respectability are synonym-
ous terms.” Thethermometer wont up to 150 deg.,
and in the city was seen the curious spectacle of
cartloads of Japanese fans being retailed along the
sidewalks at a penny each. The universal feeling
waa one of—
“ Adduxere sitim tempora Verglli.”
Longing for liquids both laymen and clergy lie.
Off to the shores of the rhythmical surge ’ll I,
Bi caking so dreamily, lazily, dlrgily.
Free from the strife of tongues, never a word
shall I
Utter, but list to the sea-skimming bird shall I.
Oft from the green depths all gleaming emerge
fresh fruits, and on cieara, and on curds
Dream of romances that never occurr’d shall I;
Then back refreshed to the brain-working herd
shall X.
On the first two days of the match, 28,903 persons
paid for admission, £1445 being taken at the gates;
in addition, the pavilion was packed. The gate
money was divided equally between the Aus-
tralians and the Surrey Club, the latter taking all
receipts for reserved stands and enclosures. The
wickets of the Australians, whose gigantic innings
lasted just nine and a-half hours, fell thus:—One
for 15. two for 158, three for 365, four for 433, five
for 454, six for 494, seven for 532, eight for 545, and
nine for 549. Thus 417 of the 551 runs were made
between the fall of the first and fourth wickets,
and runs came almost at the rate of one a minute.
Eight Australians were caught out, and the only
time the wicket was hit in the two days was when
Bpofforth was bowled by a lob. Strangely enough,
Spotforth’s wicket fell to Lyttelton, to whom the
“Demon” returned the compliment in the En-
glishmen’s innings. There have been three occa-
sions in a first-rate match in which three individual
scores of over 100 have been made. The first of
these was at Sydney, in an intercolonial match,
when the N.S.W Eleven scored 775—Murdoch, Gar-
rett, and Jones being the men who reached three
figures. The other two occasions were both this
year—one when the M.C.C. beat Australia at Lord’s
and W. G. Grace, A. G. Steel, and Barnes were the
successful batsmen; and the other at Cambridge
for Yorkshire against the University, when Hall,
Bates, and Grimshaw each scored over 100. On
each of these occasions, however, the three 100’s
were not all made in one day; and the peculiarity
of the cricket of 11th August—the thing which dis-
tinguishes it over every other—is that three indi-
vidual scores of over 100 runs each were made in
one and the same day. It is further without pre-
cedent that three of the first four names on the
batting order should each have over 100 runs
against them, and that, while the second wicket
added 143 to the total, the third should have earned
205 runs more, and still be intact.
The Trappist monks have opened a branch
of their famous monastery in Ireland. The order
lead a very queer kind of life. Rising at two
o’clock every morning, winter and summer, they
pray In their church till half-past three. Their
outdoor work begins with the earliest light. Their
food consists of vegetables dressed without oil or
butter, and followed only by a little fruit. Their
supper consists of bread and water. Their bed i
a straw pallet, with one hard coverlet. We sup-
pose that, as the members of this particular
branch are Irish, they are potato-1 rappists.
Now we begin to understand why Henry
George did not see his way to visit the Australian
Colonies for the propagation of his Land Nationali-
sation theories. He has evidently been reading the
reports which appear in the country press of the
local debating societies; and, finding how easily
those brilliant debaters knock the bottom out of
his best arguments, he wisely determined to con-
fine his teachings to the benighted people of Great
Britain and America. We say wisely, advisedly,
for have not the profound thinkers of Corowa
tackled the question of “ Freehold property in
land” (vide Corowa Distress) ? and after strug-
gling heroically with that mighty problem, they
have decided by a majority of one in a thin house
that Mr. Georye knows no more about the subject
than a hen would hold in her shut fist. True, the
Irrepressible and eloquent Clayton held up his end
of the stick gamely on behalf of the absent
reformer; but what show had ho against the cul-
tured Jenson, the erudite Oswald, or the learned
Holman ? None whatever; and, consequently, the
matter is settled at once and for ever. We feel
that the country is safe so long as the Corowa
debating society keeps its head cool, but we
tremble for the consequences should it be other-
wise.

There was a very large attendance at the
Railway Ball on Friday. It was clear the promo-
ters made a mistake in not having the Exhibition
Building, as in previous years, instead of the new
Masonic Hall. This latter was not nearly large
enough, and the result was that the committee
had to close the doors against some who wanted
to come at the last moment, to prevent those in-
side from being too crowded. It is impossible to
guess beforehand how many people will come to a
nail. But this railway ball has become so popular
that numbers of outsiders desire to attend it, to
enjoy a Jolly dance, in addition to the large
patronage it receives from the department, and
in future the Exhibition can be safely taken.
With the Increased attendance, the committee
In no way relax their vigilance of manage-
ment, and on Friday night the most watch-
ful care was given to every detail. The only
real defect was having to trudge up to the sky-
high supper-room every time one wanted refresh-
ment; and by the time a man had escorted four-
teen successive ladles up and down, the climbing
began to get rather monotonous. The fault, of
course, was not the committee’s, but that of the
building. It might be possible, when there is an
extra large ball, to have the two cloak-rooms on
either side of the entrance door used as. supper-
rooms. The masters of ceremonies wore Messrs.
W. H. Chandler, D. M’Qrath, and 8. Stanton, and
though only amateurs, they were quite efficient.
Messrs. W. G. Pearce and M, J. Daley, the joint
secretaries, lent every assistance. Callaghan pro-
vided supper, and the Young Australian band
served up the music capitally. To show that they
keep up to the times, they gave a very pretty new
waltz Jfrom the “Merry Duchess.” There was a
Hanlan schottlshe ; but Beach does not seem
to have permeated the ballroom to any extent as
yet. The number of Redfern girls present at the
Dali proved wh«t an influence the railway young
men exert in their own district. One of them was
a charming little short-hair from Castlereagh-
street, with one of the prettiest dresses there-a
pink satin with pearled collar, and soft pink skirt.
Another was from Goold-street, most prettily
dressed in the fancy character of Rowena, from
the “Merry Duchess;” and a third was a “son-
sie ” Highland Lassie, full of dancing and spirit.
The most conspicuous dress in the room was worn
by a very tall blonde—cerise satin bodice, and
skirt of cerise tarletan, the scallops edged with
black laco and caught up with sprays of silver
leaves. Some ladies said there was too much
colour; but they were most likely jealous because
the dress was so stylishly made. A little blonde
from Woolloomooloo danced gracefully in her
heliotrope satin and white lace, and was very
fair and piquant. A married lady, tall and
fair, wore a fine black broche and silk,
trimmed with much fruit; and another tall fair
girl In black grenadine, • dged with terra cotta
lace, looked as if she is single at present—but she
shouldn’t remain so long. In claret skirt and
white muslin, with a sauoy-looklng hat, was a par-
ticularly pretty German Peasant; a Daughter of
the Regiment was neat and fascinating, and Nancy
Lees were present in shoals. An excellent brunette
dancer wore a most dainty dress of ivory figured
silk and ostrich feathers just tinged with colour,
the skirt of spotted muslin in small flounces. An-
other good dancer, named after the queen of
flowers, wore a corded silk of orange colour, which
trailed very far behind—in fact, it was a “ special
train.” A substantial lady wore a maroon satin
and fine white lace trimming, which looked well,
with a wreath of chenille fluffs; and a dress that
manifested good taste was or black velvet and silk,
edged with broad white lace, the front of bodice
having two broad facings of the, same; and it suited
the handsome wearer. An old gold satin redlngote,
low and sleeveless, with a white veiling skirt In
long pleats, secured a meed of admiration. There
was some merit in a blue sateen theatre bodice
and draping over a veiling skirt of smoke colour;
and some beauty in a rich broche of eau de Nile,
with revers and trimmings of gold plush; and a
decided amount of style in a ruby broche bodice
and train, with be utiful ai r cot silk skirt covered
with net and caught up with ruby cresc.-ntsf v ery
rich was a Matron's blue satin diess a perfect bed
of pearls and blue daisies to match, ami worn with
a blue wreath. Rosebud was « utile brunette, in
neat white veiling edged with apricot, and dotted
with buds all over. From Gcorgc-street we»t
oime a fair girl in a pleasing heliotrope satin
bodice, with a drape of the satin across ter white
muslin skirt, Some of the fancy chaiucteis were
interesting; and others comical. Cards was good
Lizzie Stofel a fat and merry girl: a blue h-.y
jockey was busy keeping a red girl jockey caitat-
ing round; and an Amazon protected heroin t
by silver paper armour that you could stick a ul
pin through. A dazzling dancer was in navy-b.
livened with white braid and pearls, and carriea a
drum on her dress. By putting it under, she might
have produced a very fashionable figure. At half-
past four there was a great rush for cloaks. The
gratitude of a suffering community will fall on the
man who can invent a satisfactory cloak scheme.
• * *
A most pleasant social outing took place
on Saturday afternoon to mark the opening of the
sailing season by the Sydney Amateur Canvas
Dingy Club. The members invited a number of
friends to a skim round the harbour, and then to
dinner at Cremorne at 4 o’clock, the whole com-
pany being photographed before sitting down.
About 60 were present, and the guests wore cer-
tainly surprised at the liberal hospitality of the
young club. The dinner, catered by Moon, was
equal to the efforts of the fashionable city pur-
veyors. It was “ scoffed’’—that’s the brief of
“ done ample justice to.” Mr. J. J. Richardson,
chairman, proposed the “ Queen;” Commodore H.
Harding proposed the “Patron and Senior Offi-
cers;” and Mr. Milson, the “Other Officers of the
Club,” Mr. F. M’Donnell responding. Mr. G
Hellings toasted the “Guests” humorously, re-
marking that some people might try to look
down on the Canvas Dingy men, and call
them “ rag-boat owners,” but, perhaps, after all,
they could teach some people how to sail a boat,
and give them lessons In behaviour as well. Mr.
J. R. Love replied, speaking most highly of the
skill and pluck of the club: he had often thought
the flotillas of small craft on the harbour things
of beauty, and from the way he had seen them
handled that day they seemed almost things of
life. Success to the 8.A.C.D. Club was given by
Mr. J. R. Drewett, and replied to by Mr. Herbert
Downs. Other clubs was given by Mr. G. Snow,
and answered by Mr. J. M. Curtis; and the ladles
were next toasted, with a hope that on the club’s
next gathering they might be present. Mr. J.
M’Donald responded for the fair, alleging that
“taking ladles all round” It would be hard to
praise them too much. The laughter and cheer*
from the Canvas Dingy men seemed to indicate
that that particular way of taking the ladies just
met their ideas. Lastly, an address and gold locket
set with a splendid diamond were presented by the
grateful members to their hon. sec , Mr. Herbert
Downs, for his zealous exertions, and then the
crews took to their dlngies, and the visitors to the
Prince of Wales, and reached Sydney at dusk,
• •
A programme of twenty events was pro-
vided for the Church of England Grammar School
sports, and as nearly forty persons gave prizes or
other donations, the young athletes were pretty
liberally rewarded for their efforts. There were
very large entries, a very m xed band in attend-
ance, and a number of enthusi -stic boys permeat-
ing the grand-stand who m de a babel of noise
quite disproportionate to their size. The meeting,
it should also be observed, enjoyed the distinction
of being under the patronage I the most reverend
the Primate. Wo are obliged to contess that we
got so interested in the small boys’ struggles,
especially in the three-legged rac°. that we for-
g t tn look for the Bishop. But If the head of
l|io Church was not t’lere, there >vere i-.isut,

Those beings without whom man's life
All sombre shade is;
That sex who all description mocks,
Who blast our hearts and darn our socks—

We mean—the ladles.
We bless those small athletic boys—
Yes, bless them all, despite their noise—
For they did bring them.
What though the Bishop wasn’t there?
Oh, hang — no, bless him! we don’t care,
So long as those sweet church belles were;
Who wouldn’t ring them ?
Two pretty sisters were escorted to and fro many
times by a tall walker, and their navy-blue and
Galatea-strlpe dresses were just as natty as any
pretty face would need. A little thing sparkled in
a fungus-brown cashmere Mary Anderson of the
neatest kind, with ribbon trimmings of satin to
match. A rather peculiar but effective combina-
tion was a plain dark red skirt topped with bodice
and draperies of the whitey-green of a dried leaf.
One of the noticeably good toilets was a small
bodice of warm fawn-coloured cashmere, and a
skirt of greenish-black satin in tabs alternately
long and short, ended with pompons, fawn show-
ing at edge. A grey satin was severely plain, both
body and skirt being drawn in long loose folds
with a few tucks—no waistband of any kind being
visible. A nun’s-velling the colour of mown hay
was tasteful, set off with maroon. Perhaps as nice
as any was a navy-blue dress with hair Hues of
white round the hem; cuffs, belt, and collar
marked with the same; and on the left hip draped
a broad band of soft white fabric. And exceed-
ingly neat was a rich brown cashmere and drap-
Ings with a velvet skirt of Japan brown in organ
pleats, plastron of the velvet; and parasol and hat
to match. Two pinks were as patent as one poppy
in a cornfield. What we liked best were not
fashionable drosses at all. They were two dull
greens made to fit close to the shape—with neither
crinolines nor “Jets”—very simply draped with
long pointed aprons nearly to the hem. They
were not stylish - judged by the present excrescent
fashion; they were rational, natural, and womanly
dresses, with no prominent foolishness about
them, and, with the plainest black gloves and
parasols in keeping, we liked them. There I

Once more into the breach, dear friends;
or, strictly speaking, into a pair of them—to do
honour to the Masons’ ball. We generally go to a
Masons’ ball with a feeling of apprehension;
there’s a weight at our hearts caused by the con-
stant dropping of weights on our toes. And there
seems no weighto escape. When a Mason drops
his foot on ours, there seems to be real masonry
there. You see, we write in a spirit of levity.
Ihe fact is, we have been to the ball of the Lodge
Sydney Tarbolton, and hive just got home with-
out being maimed, lamed, or blamed by anyone.
This is so unusual that it has made us elated. We
bad a rea good time among the chief Masons, and
we found no sorrow about Murrow and no masher
about Washer, which two euphoniously named
gentlemen were the active managers of the ball.
Everything was so cheerful; it’s so nice to get
home whole and unhurt, that—
To-night we’re gay—Pegasus’ cart
No funeral hearse is;
We feel like taking in good part
The smallest mercies;
Our head’s as light as is our heart,
Or as our verse is.
With Sydney girls we danced to-night—
And none are dearer—
We flew round with a fairy light,
We were her steerer;
Each whirl with our sweet satellite
Brought heaven nearer.
You guess, perhaps, we’ve lost our head,
Or something near it;
Or looked upon the wine when red;
You needn’t fear it—
We danced, as Allen P. has said,
“With spring and spirit.”
That’s all I We merely danced In tune
A little caper;
Our head’s as clear as is the moon
From any vapour;
W e didn’t—there, now 1—even spoon—
We’re " on the paper.”
We considerthls self-denying conduct all the more
creditable, as the amount of flirting material
available was immense. Numbers of really nice
girls, with all the advantages of youth and skit-
tlahuess, were flitting in every direction; and,
as the music was good, and there was plenty of
room, what more could a human man want?
Programmes were well designed, one leaf contain-
ing a full list of the Masonic stewards of the lodge,
but the cards happened to be so very flimsy that
they split almost as a touch. The first thing most
ye pie did was to tear off this particular leaf as
superfluous, and the consequence was that very
soon the stewards like Sennacherib’s host, “ lay
withered ani strewn” all over the floor. Messrs.
H. V. Martd m and H. Murrow were M.’s C., and in
addition to .ne Lodge officers, we saw among visi-
tors tue W.M. of the Jttobert Burns Lodge, E C. t
Mr. jifti .iitou jacob, and the W.M. of the Sir Coiln
Campb« I Lodge, 8.C., Mr. Baird. Of the ladles at-
tached to Masons—at least, we hope they are at-
tached to them—one married lady wore a very rich
and handsome dress: it was claret satin with a
trimming of gold-patterned claret that looked just
like chain mall. It would certainly chain most
males with admiration. Another lady, exceedingly
tall, looked elegant in a black dress with half
sleeves, pink feathers anc gloves. A third married
lady wore a crushed flower-pot coloured dress of
groat richness, set off wl.h fine white lace, and
looked stately. Mrs. Martin’s dress was sumptuous,
the bodice and waterfall were of peacock blue satin,
edged all round with peacock eyes; the skirt was
cream satin, in broad pleats, richly decked with
lace, white beading, and bunches of berries and
leaves. Miss Arrowsmltb, whose name suggests
the cupid darts she was shooting all the evening,
looked gentle and good in black and sunflowers;
and Miss Croft nice in shaded flounces of cerise
satin. A very fashionable costume was gracefully
worn by Mrs, Hourigan - ivurv satin sleeveless
bodice and bouffant train, with a skirt of blue
satin, enriched with fans of eidelweiss lace and
pearls, a breadth of the blue being also 1st in the
front of bodice. A blue veiling dress garbed a
y«ung lady who had an owl slant; tigwlse on her
bosom. An owl is always wise, whatever position
he is in; but he is particularly wise when he
chooses such a nice perch. Mrs. Welsh was charm-
ingly pretty in white veiling, with rich, chestnut-
hued collar and trimmings. Quietly aimring was
Miss ttae, a slim and graceful girl, in pink, who
had to catch the last train to Granville -one of the
brightest rays of the evening. Miss Celia Ger-
ard, of North Shore, in pink, was one of those
pretty maidens who would cella fate in no time.
One really enchanting dress was of pale primrose
satin, beautifully fitted and bunched; only we lost
interest in the lady after seeing another fellow
kiss her. As he didn’t make any secret of it, we
don’t. Besides, there was a tirst-rate supper, and
we think people ought to be satisfied with that
without wanting ali sorts of V;r its. A tall bru-
nette showed to adva. . jo in wcite grass cloth,
garlanded with rich rti. holly h.< ks. Miss Edeson
was an attraetive partun m ciu*red strawberry
satin and white lace; Miss Gralutn delightfully
neat and cool in white inoitimuslii) and pink roses,
nice enough to India the feelings c» sensitive youth:
and Mrs. Moody wore a beau i:l u. r lack satin decked
with white ostrich plumes, thar moved a source of
many admiring remarks O . < e many others,
time forbids a descrip'e, i : ► • >
One there is still in our memory caught.
And, though time is brief and our life but a
span,
We really must mention so dainty a sort—
So dear, yet seductive, a sort to man;
In satin and veiling so white and neat,
A perfect chef-d’oeuvre in Nature's plan,
A nice little thing, with a face all sweet.
And feet like the feathers that tipp'd her fan.

Mr. C. J. Graham and hiswife, of Orange,
Invited a number of friends to a celebration on
the 23rd ultimo, In the Oddfellows’ Hall. Ladles
kindly presided In turns at the piano, and drew
music from It which beat the local band just as
wholly as Orpheus oould beat an Italian organist.
They kept it up for nine blissful hours. Ladles
were in the majority, and some, but for a few in-
defatigable and large-minded of the panted (and
panting) sex, might, have graced the wall, or re-
lieved the refreshment table of its groaning load.
Of these generous and active gentlemen, the host,
the C.P.S., and a visitor from the new railway line
were conspicuous. The fair were in excellent
spirits, the gentlemen a leetle lazy. Unfortu-
nately, there are so few single ones in Orange, that
they are spoiled. As to the ladles—a vision in blue
captivated several hearts (no, not hearts, they re
not fashionable among men—say their!*'vanities );
but her elder sister in black eclipsed her, looking
lovely in a costume of mauve and white, with a
Kly irresistible head. A representative of Camp-
town, in pale pink, looked admirable; and the
ghter of a Sydney solicitor combined pink
toiltt and great agreeableness. Miss Kite, in
cream, monopolised the minds of several; as did
Miss Bella M‘Kay, in white, to which her raven hair
afforded a pretty contrast. Two blondes in pale-
blue shared, perhaps, the pride of place—one being
local, the other from Darlinghurst. Married ladies
made a pleasing muster; but everyone knows bow
easily they can get cheques from their husbands,
while single girls are mostly dependent on Pa’s
weakness, Ma’s generosity, or the simplicity of
some manageable brother for the wherewithal to
adorn themselves. Beauty unadorned is out of
fashion now. Among the mure conspicuous were
Mesdames Moulder, Kearney, Hutchinson, Elwin,
and the hostess, who, with Mr. G., made the party
“ gee ” right merrily.
* ♦ *
The property-holders oan well afford to he
Jubilant over the opening of the South Coast rail-
way, and they are going to make the celebration
one worthy of the event. There will be a regatta
on George's River, commencing at 11 o’clock on
the 15th October, a banquet at Rust’s Hotel, Sand-
ringham, at 1, and a trip up the river in the after-
nooa. At Hurstville, there will be a banquet on
the opening day, and a grand ball on the following
evening, when the City Band will provide music.
The attractiveness of the programme has already
decided a great many metropolitans to join in the
festive hubbub.

On the 34th September, a wedding of in-
terest took place at St. Luke’s, Burwood, which
church was thronged. Canon Moreton then and
there joined Mr. William Small, of Melbourne, to
Miss Annie Beaumont, who wore an elaborate
toilet of cream satin, with appropriate deckings,
and whose papa lives at Prestlelgh, Redmyre—a
fentleman in the building line, rich, and respected
y ail who know him. While being launched on
the matrimonial sea, for, as the humorous Hood
hath it, “fortunes fair or fatal,’’ the bride was
supported by live bridesmaids in the usual array
and armed with full-sized bouquets—Misses Mud-
dle, Small (bridegroom’s sister), B. Muddle, Geddes,
and E. Geddes; and Mrs. Beaumont was appropri-
ately arrayed in purplo satin with black silk, and
wreathed in smiles. At the wedding-breakfast,
provided by Correy in first-class style, there were
speeches, laughter, and applause, and Mr. and Mrs.
Small left by the afternoon train for Mount Vic-
toria, amid a shower of good wishes and rice. In
the evening there was a party in the fine ballroom
attached to Prestlelgh, which a number of friends
enjoyed highly.
* * v
At St. Paul’s, Redfern, Mr. J. G. Primrose,
son of ex-Mayor Primrose of Windsor, was married
to Miss Caroline Alice Wilson, youngest daughter
of Mr. H. Wilson, 40 years resident in Goulburn.
There were s'x bridesmaids—Misses Henrietta and
Matilda Wilson (in ruby velvet petticoats with tops
made in ballet fashion of cream nun’s veiling, and
pretty white straw Battenburg hats faced with
ruby velvet, and carrying baskets of damask and
Gloire-de-Dijon roses with ribbons corresponding
to dresses), Evelyn and Georgina Primrose (in
similar style dresses in white and heliotrope), and
Emeline and Amelia Cleary (two small girls from
Goulburn, in cream nun’s veiling and lace, with
blue sashes). The young and attractive bride,
looking innocent, was attired in petticoat of crepe
de obene, with flounces of point d’Alenyon, and
body and train of rich satin de Lyon trimmed with
trails of bridal flowers. The mother of the bride
looked well in black grosgrain silk trimmed with
broobe and Spanish lace, cream bonnet and gloves.
Alter the interesting ceremony, the bridal party
drove to Mr. Prank Smith’s, at Botany, and par-
took of a champagne luncheon. Returning to the
Glebe Town Hall, a large number of friends sat to
the dejeuner supplied in fine style by Edwards, of
the Glebe, Mr. P. J. Wilson taking the chair, and
Mr. Chamberlain (best man) the vice-chair.
Numerous toasts gave excuse for uncorking num-
berless bottles of the amber fizz; and at 9 o’clock
about 40 couples began dancing to the music of
De Groen’s string band. Three sisters from Glebe
Point, dressed respectively in cream, blue, and
sea-green satin, looked nice. Mrs. Cleary, the
bride’s sister from Goulburn, wore black grosgrain
and broche; and a Kingston lady shone in blue
veiling and satin. Devonshlre-street was repre-
sented by charming damsels in deep-flounced
white linen, tucked and laced in front with sea-
green ribbon, and by a dress of drab crepe-de-
ohene, trimmed with coral-pink ribbon velvet,
t hree William-street sisters were attractive as to
dancing and cress; and two cousins of the bride-
groom, from Regent-street, noticeable for excel-
lent dancing. Pleasuie reigned till an early hour
of the morning, when the happy couple left for
their new home at Parramatta.

Petersham is animated with a bazaar,
which was opened on Monday by the Hon. Alex-
ander Stuart. A cumber of ladles and gentlemen
were on the platform, which was blue-carpeted
and flower-edged for the occasion, and Mr. Stuart
made a little speech with a few graceful turns in
it. He observed that objections were sometimes
raised against bazaars for church purposes; but s >
long as people could not be got to do that which
they ought to do, otherwise, it seemed necessary
to get at them by these insidious means. He com-
plimented the promoters on the original character
they had infused into their entertainment, and on
concluding, Miss Jeanie Cameron was led on to
present the Premier with a bouquet of flowers,
and was at once rewarded with a kiss. It was, of
course, a platonioal kiss, Miss Jeanie beinga minute
maiden of about five. Everj thing was nattily ar-
ranged the affair combining conversazione and con-
cert with nazaar, and Messrs. W. Munro and A. J.
Arndell spared no pains to make it complete. All
the exhibits would take fartoo long to enumerate;
science and art were aided by beauty, and all pre-
sented in most attractive forms. There are three
principal stalls: “ Bcclesla,” draped In red, is kept
cy Mrs. Paton, the minister’s wife; “Forget-me-
not,” strikingly tasteful, in light blue, by Mrs.
M’Call; and,the “Mla-mia” is under Mrs. Came-
ron. Miss Blphlnstone runs the Christmas tree;
Mrs. Dowe, the refreshment counter; andanum
ber of ensnaring girls run the young gentlemen
round the room, and press them. Press them to
buy flowers and things they don’t want. There
are, and will be, concerts every evening; also
competitions in handiwork, floral skill, &c; to-
night, electroplating and gildiqg will be carried on
by Jackson Brothers, and visitors are invited to
bring anything they like to be electroplated
while they watch. A really beautiful exhibi-
tion is made by Searle and Son-a complete
dinner table, with floral decorations. There
is the white cloth, glittering with plate, cut-
lery and glassware, and in the centre is an
eight-pointed star of flowers, a yard across; the
base is a row of geranium flowers, then a row of
white roses, and pink and white azaleas follow in
rows, crowned with ferns and other greenery, the
whole forming a solid bank of flowers, exquisitely
pretty. At each end there are solid hearts formed
of other flowers. Even the glasses are all fern
marked, and the spoons and forks of floral pattern
to correspond, it is the work of Mr. Yates. Mr.
H. Corbett controls the electricity; and a large
astronomical telescope is in full operation. That
curious mechanism, the calculating machine, is
shown. The bazaar will bo open till Saturday, and
a very pleasant visit can be made to the Petersham
Town Hall these moonlight evenings.

Last week, the St. Leonard’s School of
Arts was Immensely crowded for three nights, at
the bazaar and wild-tlower (as well as garden-
flower) show. Sir Henry did not show up to open It,
as expected; but B. 8. Holtermann was there and
made a speech, which was more fun. A newspaper
called the Bazaar Chronicle, was issued regu-
larly. and musical selections were given from the
platform by many obliging volunteers. Besides,
the North Shore Band played outside. A wax-
worKshow had a certain degree of merit, and the
money results (which go to Wesleyan funds) were
satisfactory.
♦ ♦ *
The bazaar mania is again prevalent, and
the Masons are having a grand affair in their new
hall, Castleregh-street. Lord Augustus opened it
with due pomp at noon on Monday last, and very
astutely escaped the wheedling of the beautiful
young ladies at the stalls by donating a lump sum,
on the clear understanding that he was not to be
persecuted with raffle lists. His Excellency knew
that if they put his name down, he would have to
send the private secretary every night to see what
he had won, and as there are Hocks of fair women
there, heaven knows what time the P.S. would
get homo every morning. Hanlan was busy giv-
ing prizes to the Grammar School boys, or he
would have helped open the bazaar. Jennie Lee,
however, went, and was last seen burying her
suede gloves up to the dimpled elbow in the lucky
bran tub in search of sequestered treasures at a
shilling per dip. Beautiful music is given every
night, and a fine view is getable from the gallery.
Speaking financially, the gallery is the only safe
place. Refreshments are recherclU. and Quong
Tart’s tea is there as a matter of course. It would
be interesting to know if the world could get on
without it—or him. On Monday night he was one
of the beauties of Nature, covered with flowers,
and loaded with small things pressed upon him
by the Masonic charmers. The general character
of the goods displayed seems more useful than
usual, and the prices not particularly exorbitant.
At the same time, if a buyer is “ soft” the sales-
bolles don’t lose sight of the fact. The largest
stalls, prominent in the centre, are the South
Coast, under Mrs. H. J. Tarrant; and the Leinster
Marine opposite, under Mrs. Hunt. The other
holders are Mesdames Starkey, Araess, Burne,
Browne, Wills, Coulter, Weekes, Cloudy, Cunning-
ham, Carrie k, Neble, and Bsperson, assisted by
parties of skirmishing young ladies. Some very
valuable gifts have been presented. Space, this
week, prevents a mention of the many pretty
toilettes to be seen, which were well worth notice;
and, after all, the best way is to go and see them.
The ladies won’t mind.

Urana Oddfellows had a good ball in the
new Mechanics’ Institute, roughly finished for the
event. Culley's music, and Mrs. Campbell’s supper
were provided, and the hearty festivity ended at
diybreak — A N.S.W. Order of Rechabites was
inaugurated last week, and on Thursday a dinner
celebrated their start, in the Protestant Hall.
There were no intoxicants, and no toasts, but It
was a capital affair. There should be more of the
sort—On October 10, the ladies who have been to
the Petersham socials give the gentlemen a return
dance. It is to be nicely arranged, and a few extra
tickets only will be issued to f riends, as the ladies
are determined to have it comfortable The date
of the Mayor’s ball was unfortunately mis-prlntcd
last woek. It is the 15th October The Socials’
ball at Nithsdale this Friday is going to be a really
good affair. Mr. W. Dickson, hon. sec., reports
everything smooth, and all ready. Dancing starts
8.45 p.m. ..We shall have something social anent

MATHEWS OF MALOGA
HIS BOOK.
We have been a good many things in our
time. We have edited “an influential journal,”
started to “supply a long-felt want;” we have
bossed a Minstrel show (of elegant lady and gen-
tlemen performers); we have published an elegant
volume of poems (with a portrait—not a bit like us
—on the title-page, of ourselves, in spectacles);
and we have, at a similar period of our career,
been boot-japanner to a boarding-school which
declined to receive into its scholastic bosom a iy
young lady whose father was lower In the social
scale thin the tripe-trade. We subsisted on the
“ corn-cure ” for a considerable time; and, it can-
not be denied, until we were so unceasingly
“ moved on ” by the constabulary that we became
a species of “ Wandering Jew,” that we relin-
quished a chance of becoming gradually affluent
by means of our “Great Bonanza.” We have
always, indeed, striven to earn the maximun of
money at the minimum of work; but, strange
to say, it never occurred to us until lately
that a good line for a permanent “stretch off”
would be the establishing either of an ArtizanV
College or an Aboriginal Mission School. We re-
gret this in our sober moments, because we con-
sider that pureness of mind and an Industrious
attention dally to the cooking of our “little eights,”
would have eminently qualified us for the post
which (dropping for obvious reasons the Artizans’
College) Mr. Daniel Mathews now so admirably
fills at Maloga.
♦ * *
We have before us the “Book of Daniel,”
which betrays, notwithstanding all that “paw
man’s ” trials, an infinite superiority of style. Mr.
Mathews’ work is at times majestic, frequently
pathetic, and continuously interesting. Mr. Ma-
thews commences by saying: “ Fifteen profess to
be Christians, mostly women, but their lives do not
at all times harmonise with their professions."
Which would seem to be a bit of a damper; but it
will be seen later how the truly great and good
man overcomes all trivial difficulties, and is, at the
present time, still Monarch of Maloga, enveloped
In a mantle or native blanket and surrounded by a
halo ot ration sugar.
* * *
In an “Address to the Young of Aus-
tralia,” which forms a kind of preface to the
Gospel according to Daniel, he says, with a touch
of humour for which we are thankful to him—“I
could describe to you the misery; and wickedness
of the lives of the poor blacks before we get them.
Their history is a black one. ... ; ” and we
shall see as we go on the magnificent reform which
Mr. Mathews effects in their moral (if not physical,
condition at his soul-curing stockade on the Mur-
ray. Mr. Mathews (who can’t resist his little joke)
has, it would seem, every sympathy with the Mis-
sion which boards, lodges, and buggy-drives him
with such astonishing comnleteness. Listen to
this burst of indignation:—“I think the story of
the barbarities perpetrated upon the aborigines of
Australia forms one of the darkest pages in the
history of Great Britain, in respect to her colonial
possessions.” The pamphlet is full of pleasant and
sympathetic details. For instance, on April 22nd,
Jacob and Kosey Dickson were married. They
wont into Echuoa to get the knot tied; there
being, according to the rev. author, “ some wisdom
in Jacob's haste." On the same day, we grieve to
learn, that amidst the festivities occasioned by the
solemn ceremony chronicled above, a slight contre-
temps occurred. Says Daniel :—“ A Maitland
black woman—Lizzie Boney—got in a fearful rage
with me about nothing I was glad when
her passion cooled down, which it did in the even-
ing. She said she was quick-tempered, and was
sorry. 1 quite agreed with her about hertemper.”
In the final period is embodied that species of
quiet sarcasm for which rev. gentlemen of all de-
nominations have been for ever famous. Again
the Apostle of Maloga is tried; but, as it will be
seen, he is (with the aid of Divine Providence)
equal to the occasion. Read: —“ Another trouble-
some couple are Martin and Matilda Simpson, for-
merly of the Coranderrk Government Aboriginal
Station, in Victoria. They quite wore out my
patience with their drinki .g and quarrelsome be-
haviour, 1 wrote for a railway pass for them to
return to Coranderrk, and sent them away as
speedily as possible.” To the sceptical, Martin and
Matilda’s unruly habits might be thought to consti-
tute a reason for keeping the couple within the
holy precincts of the Mission until they had
tumbled into the fountain or something; but it
was tor Daniel to know best. Still staggering
under the weight of his Cross, Mr. Mathews has,
on May 8th, “ to chastise two big girls— Edie and
Bertha—for speaking insultingly to Mrs. Mathews.”
They, we learn, however, “ bore the punishment
well,” which is consoling to reflect upon; though
it would be interesting to learn what particular
clause in the Aborigines Protection Act empowers
even such a gleaming apostle as Daniel “ to chastise
two big girls.”
* • •
On May 20th, Mr. Mathews, in the exercise
of his judgment, gave, hesayo, two women “per-
mission to go over to the Goulburn River, two
miles away, In order to fish. While engaged in this
work, an evil-disposed white man took advantage
of,” etc,; a condition of things which grieved the
worthy man to the heart. More annoyance occurs
just as Daniel may have been said to have sponged
away the final tear caused by the giddy conduct of
the wicked white man. He says: “The men and
women are very demanding upon me for my own
horses and conveyance to take their sick to a
doctor. I never refuse when It does not interfere
with my regular days for going into town.” This
conduct is really too bad altogether, and for all the
more reason when it is considered that the mission
was set up partly for Daniel’s comfort and profit-
spiritual profit, of course. It appears, however,
that Edie is very queer, and that Harriet Oney Is
rapidly fading away. Probably, however, Mr.
Mathews, in declining to allow of any interference
with his “ regular days of going into town ” was not
mot by the blacks with that spirit of resignation
which might have been expected, when the righte-
ous resolution of such a good man was In ques-
tion ; for we read lower down that “some of the
senior girls are very rough with their tongues.”
The mission gets £75 in two days, and with tears of
ioy the Rev. Daniel ejaculates, “In some way or
other the Lord does provide.” Next day, however,
we have the good man “ praying to the Lord to
send us timber,” and Bertha Murrl is sent into
Bchuca Hospital, bad with pneumonia. “Her
mother,”says Daniel, piously “died of consumption
six years ago, so we are somewhat concerned for Ber-
tha.” Our italics, of course. We are told also that
“ Lotty, Harriet Oney’s sister, and Richard, are
both affected with consumption, ’ and further, in
the pastor’s own words, "I took Richard Reeve in.
Poor lad 1 the doctor pronounces it a hopeless case
of phthisis.” Then, on the next page, " Letty
departed this life yesterday. We buried her this
afternoon:” and we are also told that Harriet
Oney is “ like a skeleton,” and the poor girl “dies
peacefully ” lathe next par.
• • •
Provisions then get short; and the result
of this may be gleaned by the following: “Sep-
tember 1st, 1883.—Not much meat for the people.
They all seem to be getting disorganised. A grow-
ing dissatisfaction and disaffection is manifest.
. . . Their confidence in us as their old friends
[n’and guardians is rapidly waning, and we feel
distressed and discomfited thereat. . . . Sep-
tember llth.—The women and girls become un-
manageable. They refuse to work for Mrs.
Mathews notwithstanding all our kindness, love,
and attention. They became Insolent and dis-
obedient.” But, suddenly comes the silver lining—
“Thank the Lord I at this time we are bountifully
supplied with food. . . .” Now, all goes on
smoothly for a while (presumably as Jong as the
new supply of groceries lasts), when “ the girls
become intensely imolent ” again, and “ two had
... a fight. Jealousy was the cause of this!"
Humph I Then the cross of the worthy pastor
appears suddenly to develop into a perfect Fost-
offlee Scaffolding, for the good missionary writes:
“ At this time, malignant charges were in circula-
tion within the limits of the Mission, reflecting
upon ray moral character, and, although not
definite in their representation, were not the
less damaging. ’ However, in spite of these
bitter and envenomed darts of the sceptical,
Daniel (with a resignation which does him credit)
“felt nerved to go on in the strength of the Lord,
and meet any trouble that might follow in its
track ”; a determination, of course, which nothing
connected with this venal earth could have as-
sisted him in arriving at! On Nov. 8th, “funds
are low,” but on th® 9th they have a picnic, the
men getting “ kangaroos and hares”; but on the
23rd the worthy gentlemen’s heart “felt faint and
sick,” because short commons loomed in the dis-
tance; but this catastrophe was again averted by
£141 being paid into the till on the next day.
“Praise the Lord I” Mrs. Mathews then “leaves
for Melbourne, for a little rest and change,” poor
ladyl
• • *
Affairs appear to run smoother at this
period, and one of the blacks—Edgar—is very
much saved, indeed. He says, at the prayer-meet-
ing : “ I feel sorry for what I used to say against
Mr. and Mrs. Mathews, and the prayers. I used to
think it wore out my trousers to pray so much.
But I praise God now I can pray.” We presume
now, therefore, that he prays without his trousers.
Another valuable testimony is that of Lizzie Jack-
son. She is so much affected by Mr. Mathews’ elo-
quence, that she says; “ As soon as the service was
over, I went to Mr. Mathews as quick as I could.
I was in such a hurry that I knocked down two or
three children on the way.” Rosey is in a similarly
satisfactory condition. Listen to her: “He helps
me in my work. I used to only sweep out the
middle of my room, now I sweep out the
corners. I want to please Jesus in everything.”
We learn that the printing of this noble addition
to the literature of our country costs £8, while the
sale of the reports, last year, realized the gorgeous
sum of two shillings. The receipts of the current
year (in cash alone) were £1621 18s. while the
institution received gifts, in kind, innumerable.
One item reads—“one parcel clothes—an unknown
friend ’’—which, we trust, is not a misprint for an
unknown father. Mr. Mathews concludes with
the following cheerful admission: “Although we
have been nearly ten years entirely engaged in
this work, we teel that scarcely anything has been
done towards evangelizing the scattered tribes of
this unfortunate people.”
• « •
We wanted neither a pastor nor a ghost to
tell us this; and shall expect, at the end ot another
twenty years, to hear precisely the same admission.
Daniel ought to know—as very likely he does, by
this time—that the blacks don’t want his religion.
All they require of him is beef and tobacco, with-
out the trouble of having to work for It. Now,
what does Mr. Daniel Mathews require ? Eh ?
The advent of the Adblong Arcadian
(our little joke, Mr. Groves) has given a,fillip to
bush journalism down South, This is how the
Spencerian Groves Hatters his esteemed (?) contem-
poraryRefutation.—We note that a despicable
pdnt in Gundagai has copied a portion of a letter
which appeared in our journal commenting on a
contemporary, and has made it anpear as coming
from ourselves. In doing so it merely employs
one of those audacious misrepresentations without
which scarcely a paragraph in its columns is com-
plete.” Whoopi Let loose the dogs of war. &c.
Let’s see: doesn't the fiery Bailey still wield the
facile pen in Gundagai, or has his revolver been
permanently damaged ? We pause for a reply.
While giving utterance to a wail of undis-
guised sorrow over the want of railway commu-
nication with the outside world, the editor of the
Adeuono Argus grows feebly f mny, and even-
tually blossoms out into a humourist of no mean
order—that is. of the Peter Campbellian order.
Listen“ By the way, the need of speedier transit
than we now possess is daily felt by our community.
This great want is sapping our social institutions,
retarding commercial transactions, and threaten-
ing to stop the growth of our population. In proof
of these assertions, we may state that a youthful
and blooming lady, while surveying a portion of
her bridal robe, gravely informed her anxious lover
that their marriage could not take place until the
train arrived at Adelong.” Well, after all, we
should expect to find an addlepate in Adelong.
What is known in England as “the Chelsea
Mystery,” has been solved, Mrs. Timms, the woman
who was believed to have been “put out of the
way ” by her fashionably-dressed sister, Mrs.
Baker (who is in custody charged with committing
a forgery by which she obtained the property of
the missing woman I, having been found in a work-
house. There are plenty of rich men's wives and
plenty of rich women's husbands now lying in the
wards of workhouses. Not.long ago in one of the
infirmary wards there was a woman whose husband
had an income of over eight thousand a year. She
was fished out of the Thames, and sent to the
workhouse by the magistrate because she refused
to give a name. She stopped there and lived a
pauper life, letting her husband believe she was
dead rather than go back to him. In one county
lunatic asylum there are now the imbecile sons of
a wealthy manufacturer, a man whose name is a
household word. In another there was till re-
cently a clergyman whose son had held a rich liv-
ing for years. When the poor old fellow died, his
reverend son did not even come to claim the body
and bury it. The funeral took place at the expense
of the rates, and the mourners were the officials of
the asylum.
Vernon Lee, in her “Studies of the An-
tique and the Medlasval In the Renaissance,” says
that the real basis and background of fact for all
the romantic veneering of the troubadour gush-
ing was a state of chronic adultery; it was always
some great lord’s lady round whom gently nur-
tured knights were philandering, and she was
allowed and even bound by the code of the time
to be not too chastely irresponsive to one or other
of them. Hence the approved love of the Middle
Age was simply fidelity in adultery.
France is about to dispose of her Crown
jewels. In 1793 the regalia of the Crown was
stolen. Napoleon I. set to work to re-amass a
Crown Jewellery, and, by one means and another,
purchase and violence, he and the Bourbon
Princes had raised the total value of the Imperial
gems in 1833 to about a million sterling. The bril-
liants which glittered last upon the forehead of
the lovely consort of Napoleon may next flash
among the fantastic head-gear of the wife of an
Australian mutton-millionaire or of a Californian
belle.
In England, a Baptist parson was sued by
a solicitor for libel. It was alleged that defendant,
while reading the Scripture lessons, quoted ftom
Mark xii; 40, “Which devour widows’ houses, and
for a pretence make long prayers; these shall re-
ceive greater damnation,” and it was asserted that
the rev. gentleman emphasized the words so as to
make them applicable to the plaintiff, who, with
his family, was present. Defendant denied the
the libel and pleaded justification, citing the names
of four widows whose property he alleged plaintiff
had “devoured.” Ultimately, the case was
“squared.” In Australia, fortunately, we have
no solicitors who go about like roaring lions, seek-
ing widows to devour.
In Great Britain the number of physicians
and surgeons virtually stands still. The increase
of the medical profession during the last decade
has been less than 3 per cent. Dr. Ward Richard-
son, the temperance enthusiast, says this is because
doctors, in consequence of the improvement in the
national health wrought by the teetotal move-
ment, have found their occupation gone. But, as
the lawyers have Increased 13 per cent., It is quite
clear that teetotallsm has not decreased litigation,
which is, perhaps, even a worse evil than drunken-
ness. Musicians and actors have increased to three
times the extent of the lawyers, and an addition of
45 per cent, has been made to the ranks of the den-
tists in ten years. Teetotalism, therefore, doesn’t
prevent people from wearing out their teeth.
In England, now, when a well-educated
man finds himself on a lee-shore, he gets into a
railway carriage, blows his brains out with a pistol,
and goes on travelling through the Valley of
Shadows behind a ghostly engine. And when a
man who is not well educated, and who has been
fonder of beer than of work, gets hard-ftp, he first
kisses and then kills his wife, and at once proceeds
to cut the heads off her six little children with the
family bread-knife.
A boy of 16 years has been charged in
London with attempted suicide. He had been
found in a cellar half hanging from the ceiling
by a rope tied round his neck; his feet touched
the ground, but he was leaning backwards, sup-
ported by the rope, quite insensible, and black
in the face. Accused explained that he had been
reading “Jack Sheppard,” and he bad also seen
Sictures of men being hanged in the Police Neavs;
e thought he would try the hangman’s knot, but
it slipped and strangled him. This is a queer world.
Had we an opportunity, we should watch the career
of this young man with much interest. Will he be
hanged, or will he develop into a hangman ?
Truth remarks that the idea of a husband
obtaining pecuniary damages for the misconduct
of his wife is of very questionable morality. If
the “ co.” d serves to be fined, then the fine ought
to go into the public exchequer. Such, however,
is not the opinion of all husbands; and a case will,
after the vacation, make its appearance In the
Divorce Court, in which the damages laid against
the co-respondent are £40,000—the largest sum ever
claimed. The respondent has been married over
thirty years, and the "co.” is an M.P. of a certain
age, better known in the financial than in the
political world. “If I had any advice to tender to
these middle-aged people, it would be to wash
their dirty linen at home,” says Labouchere. But
just think of what an ideal condition society will
be in when the man who makes money In the public
Courts out of his wife’s shame will hand it over to
the exchequer, or to charity, or do anything but
button it up in his pocket until his next honey-
moon comes round 1
St. Jude’s, Dural, was built some forty
years back, but its consecration, horrtbile dictu,
was overlooked; consequently, all services there-
in performed during its two-score years of uncon-
secrated existence Tacked that mystical something
whiuu ioimai episcopal beuediptiou confers. Dr.
Barry has, however, made things O.K., so far a£
the future is concerned. Whether a bishop's con-
secratory powers have a retrospective effect is a
point that is agitating Dural. One couple, whose
marriage didn’t turn out for better, attribute thb
trouble to the lack of the before-mentioned mys-
tical something, and are anxious to know (as theV
have heard that there is no wrong but what has a
remedy) agaimt whom to institute proceedings to
recover damages—whether the representatives of
Bishop Broughton, the trustees of the church, or
the present Primate. As theological casuistry is
not in our line, we pass the conundrum along to
Charles Campbell and Dr. Beatty.
The Chinese Government have explained
that their declaration of war was “informal,” and
so the French, who deny that they are at war with
China, but just practising a bit, will say, “All
right, let’s begin afresh. We are both mistaken.
Make out your bill against us, and send it in. We
shall also feel obliged by a prompt settlement of
the enclosed.

The wearing of powdered hair and liveries
is a badge of servitude, and should bo resisted by
all white men. Of course, it may be argued that
powdering a man’s hair only makes him whiter.
And the utilisation of members of the human race
for the carrying of “ sandwich ” advertising boards
should be put down with a strong hand. It is less
disgraceful and derogatory to hungry manhood to
openly steal bread than to earn it by carrying
about a poster-boat d. The sandwich-man says, in
effect: “The man who employs me would stick his
bills on a post, if he could get the post to walk
about. But he can’t, and therefore I, who have
legs and have had the breath of life breathed into
me by the Almighty, am able to boast that I am,
tor advertising purposes, better than a post.” In
London, our correspondent the other day saw a
procession of 24 sandwich-men branded on one
side: “ Scott’s oyster-rooms—real Dutch natives ”;
in front was the legend; “Mr'. Attwood’s office.
Private inquiries made in divorce and suspected
persons watched, on reasonable terms.” It struck
our representative that, as the injured husband is
always the last to hear about the little game, any-
one desirous of giving a straight hint to a friend
that his wife was, in the words of Mr. Solomon,
“ carrying on,” could have done so in a gentle and
effective way by marching up the aforesaid de-
tachment of four-and-twehtv “ sandwlchers ” to
the friend’s residence, and drilling them in front
of the breakfast room window while the injured,
but theretofore unsuspecting,husband was munch-
ing his fried sole.
Persons who scoff at “ Britain’s bulwark ’ ’
—as the Bible is sometimes facetiously called—and
who positively refuse to believe that the world is
flat, although Job made special mention of the
“four corners thereof,” during that social little
conversazione he held on the dung-hill with his
three “jolly-dog” companions, would do well to
have a care, lest the grin cometh upon the wrong
side of thc-ir cachinatory apparatus. Day after
day, the history of the “ B.B.” repeats itself in the
most unmistakeable manner possible. For ex-
ample, Kina David once declared he had suddenly
discovered that “a horse is a vain thing for
safety,” and many a man who had put up his chips
on The Broker for the next Victorian Derby must
have jumped to the same conclusion when the
colt was scratched last week, although sound In
wind and limb, and running bravely. Then, again,
who does not remember the story of the Jewish
land agent, Ananias, by name, who was struck
dead for telling an Evenoozer to the chief of the
original twelve apostles. Something similar hap-
pened a few days ago in Melbourne, when James
Aitken was cut off in the flower of his youth, at
the untimely age of 80 years, in the Salvation Army
Barracks. James, it appears, had listened with ail
the attention of a man who had paid for a front
seat, and wanted to secure the worth of his money,
to a certain Captlng’s oration on the hope beyond
the grave, and on its close he arose and observed,
“ them's my sentiments to aty-ty.” After this, he
shouted Hallerlooyur, declared he was saved, and
then dropped down dead at the Captlng’s sacred
No. nines. Apropos of the Harmy across the
border, we regret to say another good man has
gone wrong—in fact, he has gone to gaol. “ Happy
Bob ” is the slider from grace this time, and it
appears he was found in Bridge-street, Ballarat,
a few days ago, so immoderately full of the spirit,
that he was stacking all his robes of grace in a
heap on the pathway, by way of preparing to do
an open air can-can in the costume of Adam be-
fore the fall. On the arrival ot the Philistines,
Roberto Felix showed fight, and it took the com-
bined efforts of 18 feet 3 inches of the “ foorce ” to
get the “darbies" on his wrists, and wheel him off
on a fruit-truck to the interior darkness of the
lock-up. This is sad; for, although Bob subse-
quently attempted to justify himself by pointing
out that even Peter was imprisoned and flogged,
still it wasn’t, as one of Bob’s congregation ob-
served, “fur fillin' up his tank wld tangle, an*
makin’ a hass ov ’imself on th* public pathway.”

MONEY AND TIME SAVED.
Messrs, thomas henderson and co.,
Agricultural Machinists, of 89, 91, 95 Eliza-
beth-street North, Melbourne, furnish us with
the following combined statements received from
some of their employes, under date 26th January.
1884 Mr. William Downes says ; “ With pleasure
1 bear testimony to the efficacy of St. Jacobs Oil
as a household remedy. One application I have
found to totally remove the pain and marks of a
severe bruise, and 1 believe it to be an Invaluable
remedy for sprains. Since experiencing its good
qualities I have recommended it to several friends
tor neuralgia, soreness of chest, &c , and in every
instance it has given i eliof.” Mr. w, A. M'Horg,
accountant, contributes the following statement:
“ I sprained my ankle very badly. I tried the
efficacy of St. Jacobs Oil. My ankle was greatly
swollen and painful, but after the first application
the swelling had sensioly decreased and the feeling
of stiffness entirely gone out of my leg ; In fact,
a week’s dally application of the Oil effected a
complete cure, and I had not to remain away a
tingle day frombusln.ss (A friend of mine, afte
seeing my ankle, prophesied three weeks’ deten-
tion at home) I believe the Oil to have great
curative power for sprains, and that it possesses
the properties c.aimed for it.” Mr. R. W. Johnson,
fitter, sprained his ankle severely. He? applied St.
Jacobs Oil with the most beneficial results. In lets
than a week it has made a perfect cure, and be
was not absent from work for a single day. He
has also used it for toothache, which it cured
almost at once. He recommends it to all sufferers.
Mr. John MTntyre, carpenter, in our employ,
speaks of its virtue. . . . Having sustained a
severe fall on my back, I was, through the injury,
half paralysed, 1 tried St. Jacobs Oil, and after
using two bottles I found much relief. My arms,
which I could not raise above my head after the
fall, I can now use freely, and can go about my
work as well as ever. 1 look upon the Oil as a
most valuable medicine.

M. E. Benjamin, Ksq., of the firm of Messrs.
Hart and Benjamin, solicitors and Commissioners
for Australasian Colonies and New Zealand, make
the following statement“ Pacific Chambers,
60 Collins-street \V est, Melbourne, 11th December
1883—Messrs. Elliott Bros.—Dear Sirs, 1 have
much pleasure in testifying to the remedial effects
of St. Jacobs Oil. 1 have used it in a case of a

curative qualities.
J. R. CHAPMAN.

1 suffered every morning for years from head-
aches : vour brush relieves them at once. I heartily recom-
mend it. MORRIS FRANKLIN.
From the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Wife suffered for years from headaches; your brush cured them at _
once : it has also cured several friends. I use it to remove dandruff »
it works like a charm. My wife was getting bald ; it stopped the fall-
ing hair, and made a now growth.
GEO. THORNBURG, Little Rook, Ark.
Made of Pure Bristles, not Wires, Elegantly
Carved, and Unbreakable.
Each Hair Brush has the same elegant
‘ jn, and contains, the same electro*
magnetic power, the difference being
only in the size. Each fa handsomely boxed
accompanied by w, silver-plated compass,
by which its power can always be tested.
They have *won their way to royal favor
in England, being cordially indorsed
by the Prince and'Princess of Wales,
used by the'. King of Holland and
Prince Bismark. and written upon
by the Rt. Hon.W. Gladstone, and
are nowbrought tothe notice of the
Australian public. They cure
by natural means-will always do
good, never harm, and are a
remcdylaating for many years
They should be used daily in
place ;of the ordinary hair
brush.
From
Rev. Dr. Bridgeman,
Brooklyn.
Gentlemen, — I have
never before given a tes-
L timonial,but am willing
to encourage the use of
an honest remedy. I
1 am so pleasedwith your
| hair brush that 1 deem
1 it my duty to write you
1 recommending it most
1 cordially. My hair,
1 about a year since,
commenced falling
out, and I was rapid-
ly becoming bald ;
hut, since using the
brush, a thick growth
of hair has made its
appearance, quite
equal to that which I
had previous to its
falling out. I have
tried other remedies
but without success.
After this remarkable
result I purchased one
for my wife, who has
been a great sufferer
from headache, and she
finds it a prompt and
infallible remedy.

A squatter went into Farmer’s and asked
fora pair of gloves. The attendant, wearied out
with trying to fit an ordinary glove on to the
gigantic paw, gave up in despair. “ But what am
I to do ? ” asked the man of wool, looking dis-
mally at his great, rel, knuckly prehensors;
•‘what am I to do ; I’m going amongst nobby
people, and I can't go with paws like that r
“ What's the matter ? ” asked the shop-walker.

please,” said the shop-walker. The squatter
spread them out beseechingly, and the shop-
walker leaned against the counter tor support.

Judging from appearances, Caledonia,
stern and wild, seems to be slowly but surely going
off her chump. First of all, Sir 'Bnry. by means
of his honeyed-tongued eloquence and captivating
looks, succeeds in persuading some of the canniest
of her sons to risk a cool million lor so in a neat ,
little thing of hit own; and now, from Goulburn
comes a tale of a soft-headed Scot who, meeting
with a downy colonial, the other day, asked,
“ Goln’ ta doo it, Jim ?” “ Not much.’ replied the
other; “but s’pose we go in here and have a shil-
lin’ shake, loser shouts.” No sooner said than
done. The publican and a friend stood in also,
and the heathen cornstalk, whispering to the boot,
observed, “Put a bob iu for me, an’ we 11 save
stakes." This the guileless Sandy did, and the
worthy pair threw seventeen each. The bar-
keeper was stuck, and the colonial, reaching over,
coolly observed, “ I’ll take my bob, as we saved
stakes,” and then, quietly pocketim- the coin
which he never put in, he drank his beer and lett.
Shortly after this, Sandy detected his mistake,
and, in wild anxiety to recover the shilling (which,
by the way, he didn’t) he actually-forgot to have
his own drink.
Here is the sort of caution we like. Says
the Brisbane correspondent of the Rockhampton
Bulletin: “Well, a certain captain of a certs in
ship in a certain service has for long been desper-
ately in love with a charming damselof a Southern
city.” At the same time, we thinks ho treads on
dangerous ground. Let him hear the words of a
veteran journal that has suffered and bled tor libel.
We once called things by the right names, and had
to go to gaol for it. But an examnle will best
illustrate our meaning here. Supposing we knew
how the above scandal arose, we should go at it this
way; “A navigator, who is reputed to have ex-
isted on a portion of the earth's surface, and who
is more than suspected of having once sailed the
high seas in a capacity not unconnected with the
command of an apparatus for cleaving the waves,
and which {constituted one of a line, the reputed
proprietorship of which may or may not be a
matter for comment, betrayed symptoms of feel-
ings not altogether disconnected with sentiments
to which the bosom of youth is not entirely a
stranger. In other words-to be specific—he teit
not altogether indifferent to the charms of one of
a sex to which wo need not particularly refer. The
residence of the charmer in question might be
hinted at as being situated in a city nearer the
South Pole than to the North. Well, this jolly sea-
dog, whose name was—” (Here pause; you have
said enough).
A hundred years henca, the educated Aus-
tralian or Englishman—and we suppose that all
white men under the British flag will then be edu-
cated—who peruses the musty records of our
Courts of Law will wonder at the savagery of
what Mr. O’Ryan terms “ this so-called nineteenth
century.” In the case at Stafford assizes, in which
the daughter of a farmer sued another farmer s
son for £6000 for breach of promise, and recovered
£2000, it appeared that the “ defendant, when first
he asked for the girl’s hand, had been cautioned
that he would have to ne straightforward as he
appeared disposed to wander from flower to
flower.” (Laughter ) He thereupon vowed eternal
fidelity, but in a little while his fiancee found it
necessary to tell him that his conduct was not such
as to allow of a serious engagement between them;
in reply to this, however, ho wrote, asking that
by-goues should be bv-gones, and plaintively add-
ing: “Give me one more chauce before you throw
yourself away, and don’t think me an unhonour-
able young man, as you told me I was.” (Great
laughter ) Shortly afterwards, defendant, who
had inherited £00 000, went to Birmingham to
undergo an operation which deprived him of a
considerable part of one ihigh-bone While he
was in hospital, plaintiff, In reply to a letter he had
written, asking that she “she should stick to her
word,” said, “ i should consider it wrong to think
111 of anyone because of deformity of body, but we
can all of us improve our minds, which is of much
greater importance. It is the mind that makes the
man.” (Laughter). But when defendant got well,
he cooled off again, and when his prospective
mother-in-law asked him to a Christmas party,
and the bride-elect enclosed with the invitation a
tender note from her own fair self, saying that
“ her happiness solely depended upon him, he
visited their house and Idly excused himself from
attending the entertainment. On the day of the
party, plaintiff’s lather went over to see defendant,
and found him engaged in the genteel sport of rat-
shooting. (Laughter). He also found that de-
fendant was on the point of being engaged to
another young lady. The plaintiff, a rather attrac-
tive girl, “ gave her eyi 4 ence in a somewhat
broken voice, and burst lute tears on leaving the
witness-box.” They always do. Here’s another typi-
cal instance of our breach of promise sys;em. It
actually came out in evidence that defendant’s
constitution was utterly bad, that he was suffering
from necrosis consequent on his general condition
of health, that inflammation of the thigh-bone had
frequently recurred, and that, medically, it would
have been very imprudent for him to marry. No
doubt he was a very shabby young man. But the
fact remains that the parents of the girl, or the
girl herself, were apparently determined to have
him, healthy or moribund, necrosis or no necrosis
thigh-bone or no thigh-bone. Supposing he had
had no thigh-bone and no £60,000—what then I
And would the girl have been so firm in her belief
that “ the mind makes the man ” had he suddenly
lost £45,000 or £60,000 of his fortune ? The system
under which damages are pocketed by any woman
who has been so fortunate as to escape the disas-
trous consequences of fulfilling a marriage oo. -
tract, entered into by her with her eyes wide open,
with a man who has neither a heart nor a thigh-
bone—a man unsound to the very core and marrow
—is a disgrace to civilisation and an insult to the
Intelligence of the age. It is no argument In this
ease to say that the man deserves punishment tor
not sticking to his shameful bargain. That a man
physically so constituted should even promise to
marry is bad enough; that he should bo permitted
(not to say encouraged or forced) to carry out his
promise, would be infamous. The girl has clutched
her gold. Perhaps she is the comparatively inno-
cent party in this barter of health and beauty lor
doath ana dross—in this abortive parental truckle
wherein, for a certain amount of cash down,
hills carrying heavy Interest would be given, pay -
able by herself in long years of gilded misery; and
payable, too, perhaps, by her children in the gaol.
In the lunatic asvlum, or iu the pothouse, whither

only compensation tairly earned by any lather
who professes to feel hurt, at his daughter not
having been mated to a man saturated with some-
thing very closely approximating to “ king’s evil,”
is a flogging. Defendant should certainly be pun-
ished—but the fine exacted should go, not to ap-
peuse the greed of a disappointed fortune-huntress
and her grasping friends, but for the benefit of
society at large, which is outraged by anyone of
education who dares to act on the illogical and
unwarrantable assumption that the very laws
which, as is known by every farmer’s yokel,
govern the hereditary transmission of health and
disease in horses, sheep, and cattle, do not equally
apply to man. The tribunals of the land ordinarily
give no relief to the man or woman who makes a
fradulent contract. And would not such a mar-
riage contract have been a fraud, not alone upon
the woman, but, through her children, upon all
society? The example of even the hideous case
of Lord and Lady Colin Campbell is lost upon
mercenary parents—
“ For honoured well are charms to sell,
If priests the selling do.”

NEVER previously did any piano win such a hold
on the public as the Mignon has done since
its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
done their level best to rival us—blazoning forth
their bald -imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result hare they to show,
excepting to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Interior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales of the Mignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies—in Victoria and New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the tar north of Queens-
land ; in Now Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON

AYER’S PILLS
A largo proportion of the diseases which
cause human suffering result from derange-
ment of the stomach, bowels, and liver.
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills act directly upon
these organs, and are especially designed to
cure the diseases caused by their derange-
ment, including Constipation, Indiges-
tion, Dyspepsia, Headache, Dysentery,
and a host of other ailments, for all of
which they are a safe, sure, prompt, and
pleasant remedy. The extensive use of these
Pills by eminent physicians in regular prac-
tice, shows unmistakably the estimation in
which they are held by the medical profes-
sion.
These Pills are compounded of vegetable
substances only, and are absolutely free from
calomel or any other injurious ingredient.
A Sufferer from Headache writes;
“Ayer’s Pills are invaluable tome, and
are my constant companion. 1 have been
a severe sufferer from Headache, and your
Pills are the only thing I could look to
for relief. One dose will quickly move my
bowels and free my head from pain. They
are the most effective and the easiest physic
I have ever found. It is a pleasure to me to
speak in their praise, and 1 always do so
when occasion offers.
W. L. Page, of W. L. Page & Bro.”
Franklin St., Richmond,Va., June 3,1882.
“I have used Ayer’s Pills in number-
less instances as recommended by you, and
have never known them to fail to accomplish
the desired result. We constantly keep them
on hand at our home, and prize them as a
pleasant, safe, and reliable family medicine,
FOR DYSPEPSIA they are invaluable.
J. T. Hayes.”
Mexia, Texas, June 17, 1882.
The Rev, Francis B. Harlowe, writing
from Atlanta, Ga., says: “ For some years
past I have been subject to constipation,
from which, in spite of the use of medi-
cines of various kinds, 1 suffered increasing
inconvenience, until some months ago I
began taking Ayer’s Pills. They have
entirely corrected the costive habit, and
have vastly improved my general health.”
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills correct irregu-
larities of the bowels, stimulate the appe-
tite and digestion, and by their prompt and
thorough action give tone and vigor to the
whole physical economy.

A PRETTY FACE.
What la more to be desired by a young lady than
a beautiful, clear complexion? She may have
wealth, education, and all the accomplishments
which will fit her to be an ornament to society
but if she have a sallow countenance, and her face
be covered with pimples, it will avail but little.
Let her remove the cause of all this disfigurement
by the use of Emil Frese’s Hamburg Tea, and eur
word for it she will soon find her beauty fully
restored. A young lady in one of our pro-
HAMBURG minent institutions of learning, who
was a great favourite, not only
TEA. among her classmates but with all
the faculty, was obliged to give up
HAMBURG her studies and return home seriously
111. Chronic nervous sick headache,
TEA. accompanied by impaired digestion,
by which the circulation and nutrl-
HAMBURG tion of the brain was impaired,
rendered her very miserable. A
TEA. physician was called, who, apparently
not understanding the nature of h*r
HAMBURG ailment, failed to afford relief A
TBA. friend who had been similarly affile-*
ted, and found immediate relief by
HAMBURG using Emil Frese’s Hamburg Tea,
recommended the same to her. She
TEA. made trial of it, and, to her great
joy, found a decided improvement as
HAMBURG the result. After a few days’use of
this popular remedy, she was fully
TBA. restored.
A marvel of the age* It Is impos-
HAMBURG sible to say too much in praise of that
d oM 8fcandard remedy, Emil
TEA. Frese’s Hamburg Tea, and no house-
hold should be without it. It pre-
HAMBURG vents, as well as cures, skin diseases,
travel, affected liver, headache, nan-

tion, fevers, sleeplessness, lassitude,

ROUND CAPE HORN.
We did not sail through the Summer seas
of the route via the Cape of Good Hope, but round
Cape Horn, which is accounted somewhat dan-
gerous in the Summer. The ice then breaks up in
the Polar regions, and drifts Northward in huge,
glittering masses, which tower at times hundreds
of feet out of the water, and appal the passenger
who, after listening to the weird tales of death
associated with these glassy floating islands, looks
upon them for the first time. Once, when a ship
left port never to return, people ascribed its disap-
pearance to pirates. But the days pf piracy m
Austral seas have gone with those of the! lying
Dutchman, the spectral ship of old Vanderdecken,
and its grisly crew, “ to look upon whose fleshless
heads was death”—with the times in which the
superstitious sailor refused to sail on Friday, and
in which the British flag held not yet supremacy
in the Spanish Main. From Sydney to Cape Horn
is a distance of 5800 miles; and, after passing the
coast of New Zealand, 1203 miles from yourport of
departure, you meet with no land save The An-
tipodes ” (a cluster of rocky Islets rising abruptly
out of the sea), until you reach the iron-bound
locality of Patagonia, about the inhabitants of
which little is known save that they are most en-
thusiastic cannibals.
♦ * *
At least, one or two vessels sailing between
England and Australia disappear annually, and no
word of them ever again reaches shore. They
strike icebergs in the gloom of night or fog, and
go down like the plummet of a sounding-line, send-
ing all hands to “ the beautiful bright veiled world
where the glad ghosts meet.” I remember several
Anglo-Australian vessels which have mysteriously
disappeared-among them, during the last few
years, the Loch Maree, Loch Fyne, .and Strath-
neven. The captain of the latter, who was a good
sailor and a brave man, once told, at Soowens
caf<5, Sydney, how he had found himself embayed
by night, with two other ships, in what subse-
quently proved to be a huge horseshoe-shaped
iceberg. There was no turning back—behind him
was a fierce gale. He steered north—and met ice.
North-east—ice again. South-east—moi e ice.
Death stared him in the face. The passengers
shrieked—their wails, he said, sounded in his ears
as a funeral-knell. But, when all hope had been
abandoned, one of the crew saw in the berg a dark
spot which, the captain thought, might be an
opening. And he steered for it, and passed safely
through—though, as the ship glided between the
horrid cliffs of glass, pieces of ice dropped upon
the deck from a hundred feet above the masts.
The other two vessels struck and went down, and
will not be heard of more till the sea gives up
Its dead. Next voyage the Strathneven and Its
captain left harbour never to return. Perhaps
this time she struck a small piece of drift ice below
the water-line, and went down—or it may have
happened that, when only too late, the captain
and his men heard the sea-waves breaking on
some Icy cliff of doom.
• • •
In daylight, a great iceberg affords an in-
expressibly beautiful spectacle. It moves almost
imperceptibly with the wind and current, and
often gives you the impression that one of those
lovely white and fleecy clouds you see on an
autumn evening 1 , when the gold ©f the dead sum-
mer vainly struggles with the wintry grey of the
fall of the year, had been taken down and set on
edge, and was being drawn before you as in the
panorama of a dream. But if even on a dim day,
beneath a leaden sky, the iceberg is an enchanting
sight, what shall one say when, his faculties in-
vigorated and his sense of enjoying all that is fas-
cinating in nature quickened by the piercing
breezes of the South, he sees it in the cold and
quiet moonlight, or in ** starshine dream-laden,”
bathed in translucent rays, which glitter and
shimmer on its minarets of diamond 8 , on its fluted
columns and cliffs of burnished silver, and on its
unattainable mountain sidings, which, like gigantic
tracts of uncut opal, show nero and there trans-
oient gleams of burning red and blue, and which
here and there are sombre as the grave, black as
the gloomy abysses on which Its frozen pinnacles
majestically look down 1

Icebergs as large as the island of St. Helena
have been met with in these seas. They slowly
drift up from the desolate Antarctic regions, from
the dark and mysterious Victoria Land, where ex-
ists nor vegetation nor terrestrial quadruped, and
whose frowning coast-line of lofty mountains
covered with eternal snow is fringed by a perpen-
dicular frozen barrier 150 feet high—an apparently
endless unbroken line of icy wall. We of Aus-
tralia sometimes long to see that unknown country
“where the pelican builds her nest”—a country
that has, in my mind, long been associated with
the idea of Utopia, and in which may now, per-
chance, bo settled the long-lost Leichhardt. In
Victoria Land, mayhap, the solitary sea-bird which
has, three thousand miles from the nearest land
inhabitable of man, followed our ship for days,
first saw light—the light it may have been of the
stately giant Erebus, 12,100 feet above sea-level,
which vomits forth a torrent of fire beside which
the display of Etna would be insignificant and
which sheds its lurid gleams upon ice-cliffs that
were of immeasurable antiquity a hundred ages
ere the Pyramids were built. An ancient and
strong-minded lady passenger had been trying all
day to catch that magnificent albatross with hook
and line. But “pretty cocky” won’t bite. The
lady explains that she wants its splendid breast
“for a muff.” What cares she for the frown of
that eccentric old German sailor, who sees in the
albatross a re-incarnation of the soul of some de-
parted seaman and wistfully gazes southward to-
wards the land where the angelic form that now
encases the spirit of his dead brother has squatted
on blue ice-cliffs beneath Mount Terror, and gazed
upon manifestations of the Aurora-Australis more
glorious than any yet vouchsafed to the sight of
mortal man ? The lady is practical. She is a
boarding-house keeper, and cannot comprehend
why the bird should soar towards heaven, instead
of descending to her little lump of pork. Perhaps
she also wonders whether the albatross would
make good hush, and whether the boarders would
know the difference.
* * •
That is the second stage of the journey.
Long ere you reach Cape Horn you nave left
behind you everything, save the Southern cross,
which directly reminds you of Australia. Most of
the birds have gone, and almost the only evidences
of life now seen on the ocean are the spout of an
occassional whale, and the much less frequent
a» ; rlal circling of a “ molly-hawk.” The departure
of the birds seems to have dated from the time at
which the now murky sky ceased to flush at sun-
set, or to recall in any sense, the splendid pageants
of our tranquil tropic evenings. The thermo-
meter is below freezing point, and the fog at short
intervals so dense that you can see nothing three
ship’s lengths ahead. Very different, this, from
my remembrances of the warm evenings in “the
long wash of Australasian seas,” when one stood on
deck and watched the rapid gliding of the nuge
phosphorescent bubbles in the wake of the ship—
bubiiles. blue, sometimes, as the cloudless icy sky
of the Queensland uplands on a winter’s night-
bubbles which look as the shells of bubbles of tar
or of aniline dye would look were they filled with
sulphur smoke and hurried past on the pearly foam
beneath the glare of the electric light. 1 had seen
much phosphorescent water, but never as it was
there presented to me—m the shape of huge flakes
like the flakes of floating lire that career along
running water into which bitumen flows from a
burning warehouse.
* « «
And when your imagination is excited
rather by the sounds you hear than by the sights
you see—on a dark night, when the swell comes
up astern, and the wind whistles through the rig-
ging, and the ship rolls and heaves uneasily—you
may, as the desultory clanking of the iron chain
upon the iron mast falls upon your listening ear,
hear the din of the ghostly boiler-makers, who, at
fitful intervals mockingly hammer the sides of
iron ships that have gone down into the awful
depths of ocean with many sailor-men. When the
captain’s little daughter, in “the wreck of the
Hesperus,” heard the church-bells ng her father
said it was “ a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast.
Not so here, for ever and anon is borne to the
listening landsman the faint clangour of the bells
that ring in Dreamland, whose echoes float upon
the winds that blow from the Pole, and are lost
among the wave-crests. You hear cathedral
chimes upon the ohurohless deep, and listen to the
sound of oars in seas where no rowers row_
J.F.A.
“Snakes,” of the Barooo, is a man who, in
his time, has played many parts. His latest dart is
steering souls along the narrow path which leads
to glory, and warning the unregenerate that, un-
less they repent, and do penance for their past
sins, they’ll speedily find themselves dpio* ppr-
poise-like fiip-flapsln the boiling brimstone lake,
while thousands of playful little devils dance glee-
fully round the banks Jobbing harpoons into their
ribs, or blowing the stuffing out of their ‘innards
with nail-kegs full of nltro-glyoerine and dyna-
mite. “Snakes” now holds forth up Brisbane
way on odd Sunday evenings, and, on a recent
occasion, wound up a terribly hot and heavy dis-
course in these burning words: “And the Lord
will come upon you suddenly like a thief in the
night, and there’ll be no mistake about th way
He’ll root you round when He does come.
“Snakes” evidently believes he is well posted in
matters concerning the general business of the
Day of Judgment.
It was Patrick and Bridget’s day out on
the glorious 8th instant, and whether the boarders
liked it or not, cold wether and potted fish were
the staple dishes on many a hash-house table on
that eventful morn. Rushing down to the kitchen
in breathless haste to ascertain why the matitunal
muffins were not forthcoming, the landlady of a
Surry Hills caravanserai found her kitchen goddess
perched, half-dressed, before a cracked looking-
glass-one side of her mouth filled with a plait of
hair, and the other with a heap of pins, whilst her
hands were actively engaged plastering the roof
of her head with Liraburger cheese pomatum. A
sharp remonstrance from the landlady of course
followed; the only effect being to cause Bridget t®
half choke with (rage, and pins, and hair, as she
yelled, “Is it me y r d be afther axin’ t’ cook th
brekflsht an’ our shwate Docthur Mhoron cumin
ap th’ harbur now ? G’long out ov dat 1 Shure Oi
wudn’t looahe th’ furst soight ov me Bishop fur all

“ Oh that men should put an enemy
into their mouths to steal their brains away!” That
kind of sentiment is good enough for Brother
Booth, mind you—though he needn’t be afraid of
the consequences, for obvious reasons. But here’s
a shocking example from Bligh, wherever the
eternal Hades Bligh is:—“The proprietor of the
Telegraph Hotel (Mr. Geo. McHugh) lately visited
the metropolis in order to replenish his stock
which arrived in town last week, and judging from
the samples we have been invited to taste, we do
not hesitate in saying his liquors, etc., are pure
and unblemished.” Pure and unblemished I we
should say they scorched all the way down. For,
I further on, the editor of the Watchman sends a
patriotic t hrill through every native-born youth
and maiden by the announcement that “TheAustra-
lian (sic) Government has decided to despatch four
cruisers round the world with the object of seek-
ing openings for trade. One of the vessels will
visit Australia and the Pacific Islands ” And
again, with that thorough knowledge of Anglo-
Australian politics, for which the bush editor is
justly renowned, he lets his readers into the se
orets of State, thusly:—“It is rumoured that
Mr. Service, the Premier of V ictorla, has dismissed
Cashel Hely (sic) from the secretarship (sic) to the
Agent-General for Victoria, owing, it is alleged to
Hely'8 (sic) collusion with the Home Rule member
of the House of Commons over the question of a
protectorate in New Guinea ” Yet the leaders of
democratic thought almost howl their heads off in
their efforts to let a suffering public know that
the country is being ruined by assisted immigra-
tion and Chinese cheap labour, while the erstwhile
honest tank-sinker unostentatiously seats himself
In the editorial chair and gouges out reliable infor-
mation pro bono publici), never thinking for a
moment that there are still fences to be erected,
and gum trees are patiently awaiting the ase to
be laid to their roots, 1
The lines upon which “Antipodes” has
written “The Revelations of Common Sense”
(London: E. W. Allen, 1884) are admirable, and if
the execution of the work were only equal to its
leading idea—that of holding up a mirror to cleri-
calism; from the standpoint of a Providential
Theism—it would bo a book that should go tar.
But the good plan is worked out so
prosaicly as to damn all chances of the Revel
tions ” being a success. Having adopted the form
of a dialogue between an Anglican vicar aud an
unoxthodox individual styled Common
“Antipodes” ought to have seen to It that the
Vicar wasn’t drawn as a mere lr ?Lfe
so has he been drawn— absolutely without a single
word to say for hi as self—which makes the victory
over him by his antagonist so easy as to be worth
next to nothing. Indeed, pity, is excited in the
reader’s mind for the poor cleric, who is hardly
ever allowed to get a word in edgeways. oom-
mon Sense” goes on pouring out a stream or
Coleridgean talk anent Cosmogony, Miracles,
Kindergarten, Instinct, Vaccination, Marriage,
Lies, Sunday, Popery, Wesleyans, Metaphysics,
Hell, the Devil, and a whole host of similar sud-
jects, beneath the floods of which the Vicar is
literally asphyxiated. No doubt coramon sense s
the basis of all this talk; but it .s commcm sense
dililted with a deal too much water, and without
e’er a squeeze of lemon. Boiled down, so far as the
sermons of “Common Sense ” are concerned, and
with the Vicar’s part re-written, so as to make
him to some extent worthy of a fpeman s steel,
the book would be what its author intended It to
be-a telling argument that Theology is not Re-
ligion; as it is, the merit of the idea Is choked by
the abundance of husk with which the sound grain
is mingled. Had only as much skill been shown
by “Antipodes” in the dressing up a8 ,i n h „hc
original conception of his subject, he w ohld ha\ e
hit the white. Still, inasmuch as his work is cal-
culated to be seminal to some extent, a measure
of forgiveness miy be accorded its imperfections
of form, since, as Pope says,
“ Of the two, less dangerous is th’ offence )(
To tire the patience than mislead the sense
but tire the patience these “Revelations”:most
certainly do. It is, however, their sole dement.
The “Wild West” is the title of a novel
show which has the New Yorkers by the wool to-
day, and which professes to bo an exhibition of
life on the border, its pastimes, and its dangers. A
gentleman who rejoices in the title of Buffalo Bill
runs the bl/.., and amongst the rest of his very
much mixed performers are bona fi.de representa-
tives of the Pawnee, Sioux, and Omaha “ luguns
—all members ot unfriendly tribes when at. borne,
but who have for the present agreed to bury the
hatchet in order to scoop in the almighty di-.llar,
and enable themselves to have at least one good
howlintr tear before the Great Spirit calls lor a
personal audit of their sc-lping stewardship.
Everyone who takes partin this sensational shivoo
has had the experience he illustrates-" bin thar
himself," as the proprietor puts it—from Buffalo
William down to the man who chows the meat tor
the Indian’s pemmican sausage. The whole of the
company pig together on the show-ground, and a
curious mixture of civilisation and savag ry is
occasionally seen when an Indian squaw is dis-
I covered hauling on a pair of gold-clocked, navy-
blue stockings; or Buck Taylor, the King of the
Cow-boys —a rough-looking Hercules, six feet
three in his vamps, wearing long, thickly-populated
curls reaching to his shoulders, and a beard about
half a life-time old-is found dickering with an
ice-cream cart driver for another “ pint o yellow
snow-juice.” The first thing a cowboy is taught
to do is to throw the tangling lasso, and it is no-
thing strange, we believe, to And the crowing cow-
infant lassoing the maternal breast with a strand
pulled out of his cow-parent’s bcot-lace. Aston-
ishing tales are told of the deeds done with the
snaky line by the cow-boys when on a Jamberoo;
and amongst these is a story of Buck Taylor s, to
the effect that a select crowd of these ox-enoour-
agers, having driven their cattle into a certain
Western town, paid a visit to the gallery of the
local theatre, and amused themselves by lassoing
the ballet-girls as they slung their saltatory appa-
ratus round the stage. Just as a Blanche de Polo-
tiers. or a Nellie St. Clair, would point her toes
seductively at the roof, “ swoosh ” would go a cow-
boy’s lasso, and down the fair nymph would come
on her back in a style calculated to “bust the
boards, and then away she would sail in the air
like a pawnbroker’s guardian angel trying to get
into heaven backwards. After half-a-dozen or so
of the affrighted Taglionis had gone up to glory, a
cry of “ Shame ” and “ Chuck ’em out” arose; the
cow-boys pulled out their llre-lrons, and half-an-
hour after this the theatre looked like a gigantic
collander caught in a tropical hailstorm, and the
happy old coroner of the town stood on his head
for joy at the thoughts of the coming harvest.
The “Wild West”—to use an Alfredism—“takes
well.”
On 30th July, at Brooklyn Gaol, Jefferson
a negro murderer, who was about to be hanged,
requested and obtained an audience of the repre-
sentatives of the Press, of whom some fifteen wei e
present. Before the conference commenced, the
prisoner turned to the Under-Sheriff and said, with
great nonchalance, “ Won’t you send me a box of
cigars? I would like to give these gentlemen
some; I want to return good for evil as well as I
can, although I suppose it will be a great surprise
to them.” The cigars were brought, after which
Jefferson had a free talk. The substance of his
remarks was that ho had not been dealt fairly with
by the newspapers, but that, as he had now ex-
perienced a great change of mind, he would refrain
from saying some things on that head which he
intended to say. He also wanted to say something
about capital punishment, but since he had be-
come a changed man he thought it would be just
as well to say nothing about it. Then, turning to
the Sheriff, he asked if it was true that the sur-
geons were going to cut up his body after he was
dead, as he had seen something of that kind in the
papers. The Sheriff reminded him that, at his own
request, the doctors had promised to examine his
brain. “That is all right,” he added; ‘but, if
they examine my head, that is no reason why they
should cut up my whole body.” Jefferson was
then “launched into eternity.” This is as it should
be. When we hang a man, we do it good-naturedly
and not out of revenge. We hang him merely
because he can’t agree to any reasonable extent
with the great majority of society; and, as when
he is about to be “turned off” we have clearly
got the upper hand of him, we should make
things as pleasant as possible for our enemy m his
last moments. When, therefore, Mr. Charlie
Cowper and his assistants next give a seance on
the gallows at Darlinghurst we shall expect to see
the culprit allowed every chance of writing to the
newspapers, and talking to the reporters, and
banding round a tortoiseshell cigar-case bearing
his monogram in silver, and discussing the volume
on capital punishment written by the 1 Ublic
Librarian at Hobart. Some people may feel in-
clined to laugh at this style of execution. We, on
our part, consider it an exceedingly gentlemanly
entertainment.
