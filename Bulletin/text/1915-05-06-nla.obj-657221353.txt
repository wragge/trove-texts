Hope—Even for Wives
It is to you, wives, that W. L. George
brings joyful tidings. There is hope for
you, even though you’re married, even
though you’re happily married. You fall in
love, marry, get through the wearying busi-
ness of having children as quickly as you
can, nurse your small family, grow accus-
tomed to your husband, settle placidly down,
and then If you’ve married well, if there
is plenty of money and your husband be-
haves, you begin to find that the zest has
gone out of your lives. Your husband is
husband, not lover; he is busy, interested
in his work; you are sufficiently well off
not to have all your time taken up in the
nursery; you can hire competent nurses,
governesses; and you find that your chil-
dren are growing up, growing away from
you—every mother’s tragedy. What is
there left for you to do, still triumphantly
in your early thirties? Here comes W. L.
George, with his good news. Though
Nature has made your figure slightly
matronly, she does not mean to discard you
altogether. There is a second blooming for
you all. It has not the glorious excitement
of your first blooming, but it is indubitably
another flowering of your soul and body.
So W. L. George, author of The Making
of an Englishman and that rather naughty
A Bed of Roses, titles his latest and finest
work The Second Blooming (Unwin, per
Dymock’s Library). It is a book that, dedi-
cated to Wells, equals Wells for modern
interest. In this book W. L. George has
made good his claim to be henceforth
reckoned among the first living English
novelists. And among other things W. L.
George is the London correspondent of the
Dunedin (M.L.) Evening Star.
Jt
Like May Sinclair, W. L. George tells
the story of three sisters. They are all
happily married: their husbands are dull
but faithful —perhaps it would be better to
say faithful because dull. “It’s a large
family,” their mother used to say, “but the
girls will marry.” That signified the satis-
factory end of all daughters: they married,
had children and kept on being married.
Mary married and had children; she kept
on having children. Clara married a rising
M.P. and became the perfect member’s wife.
She found in politics and His Career the
excitement she had begun to miss in Him.
And Grace woke up from marriage. She
discovered one day that she could not recall
the shape of her husband’s nose. She had
seen it too often. (By the way, can you,,
off-hand, remember the shape of your hus-
band’s nose? If you honestly can’t, it’s a
Sign.... There are flowers that bloom in
the Autumn, also.) “Grace knew that,
somehow, for three months, she had been
analysing him, herself, their relation, with-
out arriving at anything more definite than
that her individuality was disentangling
itself from the quality which is marriage.”
She felt rather angry with Mary, because
Mary was so soddenly content with babies
and with preparing for more babies. She
called Mary “Queen Bee.” Grace began to
think that her life wasn’t Life. (That’s
another Sign, ladies.) Certainly, Edward
was trying: Edward was always so arch,
and would call her “Gracie-Bracie.” Though
there was a time when Grace had thrilled
at that absurd lover’s name.
Grace woke up—to Clothes. She “went
in” for Clothes, and she liked the sensation.
But the clothes were not for Edward, for he
had turned from the lover into the: husband.
That creature so like man and yet so dif-
ferent, wiA her long hair, her softness, with
the queer., quick, humid gleam in her eyes
when she looked at him; that creature of
unaccountable impulses, so prone to lie, and
so ready to give her life for a man. so vain
and so egotistic, and yet so thankful for a
kind word that creature has lost its mys-
tery, and the man has turned away. He is
not a man any more, but a husband; he has
become what all husbands become.
And, with this new restlessness on her,
this instinctive seeking for distraction, Grace
found that men were beginning to look at
her —differently. “She was shocked, but
thrilled.” And then, “Grace was accosted
by a man in Kensington High-street.” An
extraordinary man —the trouble in novels is
that the man is always extraordinary;
whereas in life the sort'of man who tries to
“pick up” respectable girls is quite suburban.
Of course he found out whom she was, and
contrived, rather cleverly, to be introduced
to. her. He was an expert in the art of
“picking up.” He told Grace that it was
splendid fun, chasing women. He explained
that it was an art. In his case, “none but
the respectable need apply.” Once again
Grace was shocked, but thrilled. (That’s
another Sign, ladies.)
Grace talks it over with her sister.
“Perhaps there’s only one thing for us to
do: to get a man. And when we’ve got him
we’re done, unless we’re poor, and have to
do some really necessary things: cooking and
washing the baby, cleaning the steps, all
that!.... We’re not strong enough to cook
and clean—it’s been bred out of us. Ana we
have never learnt the piano or how to deco-
rate. We were taught to strum and to
daub. We’ve just got to go and find some-
thing else.”
“What else?’’ asked Clara. "Children, I
suppose ?”
“No, children are the best drug in the
world for married women, but still only a
drug. It’s the real things, the real adven-
tures, we want....” She remembered
Fenor’s words: “We men, we’ve got all the
adventures: war, politics, business. But for
a woman there’s only the adventure of love.”
Her marriage adventure was over. Her
children had grown out of the need of her.
There was only one other adventure left.
He took her to his flat. Grace was a Puri-
tan : she didn’t acquiesce easily. She was
shocked, but thrilled. For a woman who
is a mother doesn’t stop being a woman
when she’s a mother.
So for three years Grace bloomed again,
with Fenor—and her husband never knew.
In the meantime the two other married sis-
ters bloomed, too. Clara fell in love with
a political association that she had to nurse
and lavish all her mother’s care upon. Mary
periodically fell in love with a new baby,
her only drug.
A dangerous book, ladies. A novel that
should be burnt by the common hangman
employed by happily-married men. But, no!
W, L. George does not stop at the erotics:
he goes grimly on. He reminds us of the
people who get married for love, and what
happens to them after. This illicit affair
of Grace’s became, in three years, so like
marriage that it had few of its merits, while
it had to face most of its perils. It had to
end, like everything else, like marriage.
Suppose she and Fenor cleared?
They could make only a life similar to the
one she had lived with Edward; they could
not maintain the one she had led with Fenor,
the secret, passionate, dangerous life.
She would only exchange one respectability
for another respectability. . . .If they had
come together in the flush of youth they
might have managed to preserve for a while,
not their passion—for that was impossible—
but something precious, to preserve it a little
longer than she had preserved it with Ed-
ward. But they knew that they could not
have saved it for ever —saved it from the
preoccupations of children, money, society,
rates, wine bi 115....
So the petals begin to fall from the rose
that had blossomed for the second time,
even as they had fallen a decade before.
And Grace closes that wonderful affair, and
her husband never knows. And the three
saddened sisters recognise frankly that their
second blooming is over. Each in her
way had blossomed: there was, really, very
little to choose between the three methods.
The main thing was that they had blossomed
again. They had their memories, and their
memories made their hope; they remembered
their old happinesses. If you take marriage
that way, there’s hope—even for wives.
Fiction
Space, as the human mind knows it, has
only three dimensions. Things have length,
breadth and thickness; and there are
only three directions in which a body may
move—north or south, east or west, or up or
down. But the question has worried mathe-
matical minds as to whether there might not
be more than three dimensions in space. Why
shouldn’t there be a fourth dimension? Or
even a fifth....an rath dimension? Why
should we be confined to just three dimen-
sions? Or is it that there are more dimen-
sions, and our minds cannot conceive them?
A fourth dimension, if it existed as a pro-
perty of the universe, would solve so many
questions—the appearance of spooks, for in-
stance. A spook who had the use of the
highway of the fourth dimension could appear
and disappear at his ease. All he need do
to disappear would be to step out into the
fourth dimension, leaving nothing behind in
the only three dimensions we comprehend.
He would simply have vanished; he coiild
remain safely hidden from us in the inacces-
sible fourth dimension, and. reappear at any
other place by simply materialising into our
space of three dimensions. You can see how
indispensable a fourth dimension is for
spooks and spiritualists and other important
people like that.
Gerald Grogan is the first novelist to util-
ise the fourth dimension in fiction. Very
handy it is, too. A Drop in Infinity (Lane)
introduces us to a mad scientist who has
discovered a method, connected with metal
plates, electricity and a long-drawn-out note
on a violin, by which he can send himself or
anybody else into the fourth dimension. He
had gone by this means to another world —
surprisingly like this world, but uninhabited,
and he conceived the idea of peopling that
planet with selected individuals from this
world. The hero and the heroine are by this
means precipitated into infinity, and come to
earth on another earth. With the few
articles that the operator had allowed them
to take with them they manage to survive
and build up the beginnings of a civilisation.
From time to time other chance inhabitants
arrive—a prostitute, a Cockney pawn-brok-
er’s assistant, a Swedish officer, and, finally,
the passengers and crew of a yacht—with
the yacht complete. They colonise the new
world, and we leave them a happy and
thriving community.
But Gerald Grogan, while displaying a
delightful fancy in his plot, peters out when
he has to descend to details. Instead of
making his new world, as Wells would have
done, something utterly unlike this world,
lie merely contrives an identical world with
a few minor alterations. So the novel re-
mains in the class of the adventure story of
the unpopulated island, a Swiss Family Rob-
inson. After the clever details of the vari-
ous drops in infinity the novel is a disap-
pointment. The Fourth Dimension Novel
has yet to be written.
Edna Ferber, whose name one enthusi-
astic U.S. critic spoke of “ednaferberating
down the ages,” is one of the few U.S.
humorists whose humor will stand trans-
planting to Australia. Her business stories,
Roast Beef, Medium and Personality Plus
(Stokes, per W. Dymock, Sydney), dealing
with the experiences of that female
“drummer,” Emma McChesney, and her son,
are slick, clever and o’henryish. In fact,
one may adopt the evolutionary scheme of
Edna Ferber and state that though her
stories are not “as slick as a lightning-rod
agent,” nor “as smooth as an automobile
salesman,” his legitimate successor in slick-
ness, they are “as alert as an advertising
-expert.” For Mrs. McChesney’s son goes
into the advertising business- —-the only busi-
ness in the world of which the U.S. citizen
has made a success. In fact, advertising is
the sole national industry of the Neutrited
States. And Edna Ferber naturally glori-
fies, almost deifies, the craft, or graft, of
advertising. To her the advertising agent
is the only romantic and glorious being left
in the Last of the Neutrals. And she
does it very well. But underneath her slick-
ness there is, as in Stephen Leacock and
in O. Henry, the necessary human note.
Gilbert Cannan is the best English
exponent of the Blurred Novel. Young
Earnest, “the romance of a bad start in
life” (Bell, per Dymock’s Library), is his
latest blur. The story is extremely interest-
ing, but the reader has all through the
exasperated desire to know what the author
is “getting at.” Cannan is a writer of
whom fine things are always being ex-
pected ; with each succeeding novel he
seems to become more coherent; but he has
not yet the literary lucidity of, say, W. L.
George. Cannan is a grim realist; but he is
temperamentally incapable of stressing his
meaning, of making any of his books a work
of art. Probably that is the last thing
Cannan intends to do. He seems deter-
mined merely to set down certain things, to
place before you certain characters, and
to leave it at that. “That,” he would say,
“is Life, inconclusive, exasperating, futile.
Well,'that’s what I want you to see.”
His “Young Earnest” is a young man
who fails to get to grips with life. He
begins ivhat looks like a brilliant scholastic
career by becoming a lecturer in a provin-
cial university, marries, or is married by, a
bright young woman, and leaves her —
apparently because she wanted to be loved
more than he was physically able to love.
He finds his way to London, becomes a taxi-
driver, lives with a poor, ignorant girl who
works in a factory, finds that she is going
to have a child, leaves her, and falls in love
with a girl-friend of his youth. For the
coming child he takes no ethical responsi-
bility.
“I will not be used for a creation in
which I know no joy. I will not. cloak
brute creation with a seeming joy distilled
by mind and time and custom. I will not
be used up and broken and cover indecency
with false decency, nor be comforted with
the life that has stolen my own. My life
shall give fife, and for the giving have only
the more to give. That which I have done
with the spirit not awakened in me is done
and no longer a part of me. That which
the spirit does in me lives on for ever and
ever.”
His friend tells him what precisely is
wrong with him. “You are out for the
grand passion. It doesn’t happen more than
about once in 200 years. Why? I don’t
know. It depends on two people, you see,
and I suppose two first-rate people don’t
often meet. The rest of us lie about our
love-affairs to make them tolerable....
Life’s too serious for you. You are in-
capable of & love affair without an attempt
to make it a spiritual thing. Where we
get excited you get exalted, which is in-
fernally bad luck on the average woman.”
“Young Earnest’s” wife is quite satisfied
to be a married woman without a husband.
She finds it more exciting. And, the fac-
tory girl having gone to Canada, there is
no obstacle against the lovers being united.
A woman friend disposes of the marriage
question.
“Marriage? Neither of you has a scrap
of conventional religion. You can’t pos-
sibly be worried by scruples. Really the
marriage laws of this country are in such
a mess that it has become almost a duty
for decent people to transgress them. They
won’t be altered in our time, so there is
nothing for it but to disregard them. You
have quite enough real difficulties to face
without troubling yourselves about arti-
ficial ones. A few virtuous people won’t
know you? What are they to you or you
to them?”
There! That’s Gilbert Cannan.
A Truth (London) literary competition
has “placed,” as the three most charming
heroines in fiction (by living English
authors), Hardy’s Tess, Mrs. Barclay’s Jane
(The Rosary), and Barrie’s Lady Babbie.
Nobody voted for just those three, but that is
what the whole big vote boiled down to.
Another plebiscite decided, irreverently, the
three stodgiest poems in the language. They
are now settled as being: Spencer’s Fdere
Queene, Thomson’s Seasons, and Words-
worth’s Excursion.
The Love-Letter
The one literary composition that is in-
adequately represented in literature is the
love-letter. A love-letter should be, could
conceivably be, a perfect and satisfying
thing. Even when badly written it has been
known to fulfil its purpose, which is the
highly important job of conveying to an
individual of one sex the love of an indivi-
dual of the other sex. But the perfect love-
letter, which will do this useful service in
the most convincing way, has not yet ap-
peared in print. Of course, by exposing to
the gaze of outsiders what is meant only
for one pair of eyes, and necessarily pre-
judiced eyes, the love-letter loses something
of its delicate charm. Its public,is private.
Yet the appeal of the perfect love-letter
should be as universal as the appeal of the
perfect pearl or the perfect poem.
There are only four ways by means of
which the inherent sacredness of a love-
letter is desecrated for the public. Printed
love-letters are: (1) written by authors,
with a view to their subsequent publication;
(2) deliberately “faked” by authors; (3)
written by authors and palmed off on their
readers as the productions of their heroes
or heroines ; (4) produced in court.
The Browning Love-Letters are the most
famous example of the “written for publica-
tion” lqve-letter. They are also, and because
so, the dullest love-letters on record. They
belong to the class of love-letter stigmatised
by W. L. George as “the published volumes
of love-letters —passionate, lyrical, inter-
minable love-letters, exhausting all the
resources of hyperbole, glowing with meta-
phors, full of sumptuous adjectives.” The
Lo've-Letters of an Englishwoman are, or
were, the best known example of the spuri-
ous class. In the first place, they were not
written by a woman; in the second place,
they are not lore-letters ; and, in the third
place, it is extremely doubtful whether an
Englishwoman could write a love-letter.
The letters quoted by fiction-writers are
equally unsatisfactory: the novelist cannot
help making his heroine literary. Such
letters are as grammatical as they are grace-
ful ; their passion is as correct as their
punctuation. The letters produced in
divorce or breach-of-promise cases are much
nearer the real thing. They are written
by mere human beings in love, not literary
persons whose job it is to write about love.
Yet; the real love-letters do not find their
way into the papers. Exhibit A is seldom
a simple love-letter, which meaning nothing
contrives to mean everything—to the right
recipient. Exhibit A is usually selected,
not for its beauty, but because it contains
a definite statement needed to convince a
jury.
Thus the author of the most beautiful
thing in the world has probably never found
his or her talent recognised. He or she
writes the perfect love-letter, unconscious
of its value to literature, happy only in the
hope that it will convey to its recipient some
warmth from the charmed tumult in the
heart of the writer. It is possible that in
Australia there lives, unknown, the writer
of the perfect love-letter. If so, no lure of
a guinea will snare him or her into the glare
of publicity; but this page blatantly does
offer that sordid lure. Love-letters should
be. addressed to this page, but not written to
this page, because this page is married.
(Though there are married love-letters, too.)
But, barring this page, your love-letter can
be written to any one of your lovers, it can
be a proposal or a mere joffer to meet him
or her on Friday evening at the Manly
wharf, it can break off your engagement or
make up a quarrel: all it need do is to con-
vey your love in a letter. And. coming down
to details, the best love-letter is more likely
to be short than long; for the purpose of this
competition it should be printable without
the necessity of calling in the censor, and it
must reach this page by June 10. 1915.

The Round Table for March. 2s. 6d., is
packed with war articles. The editors
plead for a conference with the Dominions
in view of a complete Empire discussion
of peace-terms. An interesting, article dis-
cusses “Nietzsche and the ‘Culture-State’ ”;
and an historical article finds in the rejec-
tion of democracy by Germany and Aus-
tria in the years 1848-70. the fundamental
origin of the war. The Australasian sec-
tion discusses Australian public and private
finance in war-time, and naval defence and
the general election in Maoriland.
A chatty account of Australians in Action

Rifle And Pistol Cartridges
When you buy rifle and pistol cartridges you want
them to be sure-fire and accurate, and to have the
proper speed and penetration—qualities which are all
essential for good shooting. There is nothing in the
appearance of a cartridge that indicates whether
it does or does not possess these qualities, for the
elements that make them cannot be seen. Therefore
when buying you have to rely upon reputation.
Winchester Rifle and Pistol Cartridges enjoy the
highest reputation the world over for quality and
reliability. When you buy, if you will insist upon hav-
ing Winchester make you can feel confident of getting
cartridges which are sure to give the fullest measure of
shooting satisfaction. Look for the Won the box. It is

What was

We know now. Rome wouldn’t
have burned, and all would have
been happier, if he had had
Cockle’s Pills.
The same internal reasons
that made him cheerful or
depressed are the reasons
that make you cheerful or
depressed. If your diges-
tion is faulty, if wastes
and poisons accumulate
in the system, your outlook
on life becomes poisoned
too. All gloomy and
vindictive people are con-
stipated. Poor old Nero
might have been as cheery
and kindly as you are, if he
could have had —as easily
as you can get them —

The Great, Harmless Pain Killer.
UNTIL the advent of Kephaldol there had
been no certain and reliable remedy for
the lumbago sufferer. Those afflicted
know the agouy that this complaint can cause,
and are only too well acquainted with the violent
Lumbago
symp t o m s of
which it is charac-
teristic —stiffening
of the back—impossibility of making the
slightest movement without absolute agony,
enforced rest and immobility, etc.
Kephaldol is the doctors’ remedy. It was
discovered by a noted doctor —is used by doctors
-—prescribed by doctors —and most enthusiasti-
cally endorsed by doctors. It cures Lumbago.

TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harm-
less, vegetable remedy that will make the
user of tobacco in any form absolutely aban-
don the habit for good. It not destroys the
craving, the desire, the appetite for tobacco,
but restores to health the entire nervous sys-
tem, and aids Nature in entirely eliminating
from the system the Nicotine Poison of
Tobacco.

Black Swans.
Above the quiet bushland shines
The moon in azure skies,
To light the winding river-lines
Where mists of evening rise,
To bid the night-jar fly again
And wake the dreaming owl,
To stir the love of lake and fen
In wandering water-fowl.
And the black swans are soaring up,
Boaring up, in the moonlight.
Their hungry pinions, beating fast,
Wake the wind to a whistling blast —
The black swans are sweeping up,
Leaping up, in the moonlight.
The moonlight tells of mystery,
Of other worlds afar,
Of waters near the moonlit sea
Where dreaming shadows are;
A wander-call the moonlight speaks,
And, answering, they rise
From long lagoons and lazy creeks
To wing across the skies.
Oh ! the black swans are flying high,
Flying uy, in the moonlight;
From inland stream and billabong
To lakes they love they sweep along—
The black swans are flying fast,
Flying fast, in the moonlight.
The rushes whisper, with the trees,
By waters warm and brown ;
There comes a throbbing on the breeze
Of wide wings sweeping down.
A laggard cries, the leader calls,
And, circling as they fly,
An avalanche of blackness falls
From out the moonlit sky.
And the black swans are winging down,
Swinging down, in the moonlight;
With levelled neck and whistling wing
And coal-black plumage glistening,
The black swans are flashing down,
Splashing down, in the moonlight.

Apprehension.
As I walk along the street,
Fearful of each step I take,
How the buildings, menace-eyed,
Glower down from either side ;
Murky clouds roll overhead,
As I walk along the street,
Fearful of the folk I meet.
“Fool,” I whisper to my fears,
“This is just a busy town,
These are merely common people,
That a bank and that t steeple ;
Eyeless buildings cannot frown !”
So I tell my vapid fears,
Heritaged from out the years.
How the devils smile within,
Knowing more than logic may ;
“This is Hell and you are haunted !”
So they tease me ; yet. undaunted,
I make answer: “Smile away,
Gibe and chuckle, leer and grin,
I’m your better and I’ll win !”
So I do my daily drudge,
Trafficking with merchant fools,
Heart-sick of it all, and yet
Glimpsing now some minaret,
Purple dome and golden tower,
Futured in some happy hour.
Bah. the wisdom of the schools !
Be the Vision clear or smudge.
He foredooms it ——let Him judge !

Renunciation.
She had no offering for her King
Of gems or gold ;
She could not proffer anything,
Of worth untold ;
For what could any woman bring
So poor and old?
She gave her boy so true and brave,
Her only son ;
She spake not of the gift she gave
To anyone;
He found death and a foreign grave,
“For Duty done.”
She held no grudge against her God ;
She made no prayer;
She bent her back beneath the rod
Of pain and care —
She chose the path her son had trod
And found it fair.

A. HAMILTON RENTOUL.
How Sweet She Lies,
How sweet slie lies! Her dark, crisp curls
All tumbled round her soft, white 1 row,
Her red lips parted! Is she false?
I needs must love her anyhow !
She vows her truth; and truth she looks,
A sight so beautiful to see
That for the sake of it I wish
Her vows forever true might be.
Her fair, white bosom lifts and falls,
Half showing through her slumber dress,
Till I am giddy with the thought
Of owning so much loveliness.
What if her words are merely words?
Is not a pleasant blindness wise?
I only know she says she loves
And, if ’tis false, how sweet she lies!

THE MASTER ISSUE.
The ball of diversion is still rolling with
cheerfulness all over Australia. As Joseph
Cook put it in Parliament, “the war has
not clone us so much damage as the
drought.” The nation refuses to be down-
hearted. The Autumn races in Sydney
allured crowds of about 30,000 a day, and
arrangements are already in train in Mel-
bourne for the jumping events of the winter.
The tennis tournaments have been quite
successful, though a few of the leading
players were inconsiderately away at the
Front. The N. S. Wales Football League
has asked Maoriland to send a team over in
June. The cricket season —the bloodiest in
the history of the ancient game—closed a
few days ago in a blaze of glory. The
theatres are full. Eddie McGoobty is
returning. The Night Club has made a
start. On the social side about the only
indications of a murderous war in progress
are a toning-down of the dance and dinner-
giving habit on the part of salaried officials
and a tendency among Governors to join
the King in a lemonade.
Meanwhile Germany, though it isn’t going
to win, is still in a good position to win. It
has annexed practically the whole of Bel-
gium and has made one of the richest parts
of France its province. It isn’t “broke,”
as was generally claimed some months ago.
Considering the matter in cold reason, it is
hard to see how it could be “broke.” It
has been toiling for half a century—by
means of high tariffs, a policy of insisting
that every mark of German money shall be
invested, where possible, in Germany, and
by other like devices —to render itself self-
supporting. There seems to be ground for
hope that it is short of petrol and rubber;
but' even this may be one of optimism’s
glozing tales. Anyhow, it was stated casu-
ally in the Australian press the other day
that the largest motor-car exhibition on
record had just been opened in Berlin. The
alleged dearth of copper, on which a certain
amount of reliance was placed by the Allies
at the beginning of the war, doesn’t seem to
be much of a dearth; in fact, there are
growing suspicions that the alleged shortage
is a delusion. Added to Germany’s own
natural resources and to the resources
which Teuton caution and foresight inspired
it to amass from abroad before the war,
there are all the gold and food, the arms
and transport vehicles, the stock and drinks,
the drugs and necessaries and luxuries
which it is in a position to steal from its
Belgian and French victims and buy from
greedy neutrals. The German army may
presently be belted out of the fortified posi-
tions which it is sitting behind in Flanders,
on the Aisne and in the Argonne. The
Generals of the Allies say it can be, provided
certain conditions are fulfilled. But, then,
no man would be a_General if he didn’t feel
confident, under favorable circumstances, of
doing the work required of him. Press and
politicians generally refrain from dwelling
on points like these. They prefer to stress
in accents of aloof contempt the growing
inefficiency of the German soldier —his ten-
dency to be middle-aged and fat, or young
and inexperienced ; his hatred of his officers ;
the ill-feeling that is alleged, on no dis-
coverable authority, to exist between the
German and Austrian armies; the ruined
state of the Austrian forces; the futility of
the German navy; the uselessness of Zep-
pelins ; the inferiority of the German air-
men, cavalry and guns; the ridiculously bad
shooting of the Teuton infantry; the miser-
able state of the cavalry and artillery
horses; the underfed condition of the
soldiers; and the rotten morale which is
disclosed by the statements of prisoners to
their captors. Thousands believe this non-
sense ; and the result is that condition of
joyous irresponsibility mentioned above, and
a tendency to measure the horrors of Arma-
geddon by the standard of a local drought.
It seems advisable, therefore, to say again
that the abomination of desolation will have
arrived, so far as every self-respecting in-
habitant of the British Empire is con-
cerned, if Germany merely does well enough
to secure favorable peace terms. The issue
for us is a far bigger one than territory or
indemnities. There are numberless cases
where the material injury suffered by the
beaten party has been of little consequence.
Spain probably gained in a money sense
when it lost the care of Cuba and its
chronically insurgent semi-savages to the
U.S.A. Russia felt its defeat by Japan
hardly at all in a financial way. After 1870
France paid the biggest indemnity that the
world had known, and within 20 years was
again the richest nation in Europe. But
though it was rich in gold it was poorer by
an asset which is priceless. It is the
devastation of a nation’s prestige that
causes the lasting agony.
For many a year now the British
Empire has been cock of the world’s
walk. It has struck reverses, as every
game and persistent fighter must; but it
has never failed in the long run, and no
invasive foot has in modern days pol-
luted its shores or those of its dominions.
The Britisher of to day, whether he i? Eng-
lish or Irish, Australian or Canadian, is on
much the same footing as the Roman citizen
was in the time of Augustus. The fact that
he has held the distinction so long that he
has almost forgotten its worth has nothing
to do with the case. A rival to the title
has been doggedly pushing to the front in
the last quarter of a. century. This war in
which so much of the civilised world is
engaged is in its essence a death-struggle
b»tween' Britain and Germany, chiefly because
they are the only two nations that stand on
the one hand to lose, and, 1 -on the other, to
gain, the greatest thing of all. One of them
will emerge wi-th the palm. And it is the
palm that matters. Those who cannot realise
the pitiful position of the loser need only
consider the Frenchman as he was before
he knew invasion and defeat, and as he was
a year ago. Before 1870 he was among the
earth’s proudest citizens, and he had reason
to be. His country could not be invaded; —
or he thought it could not be. In the memory
of Frenchmen still living, France had stood
against the world and made a good job of it,
too. The dash and skill of her troops were
the admiration of Europe, and the nation
took the fact so much for granted that French
citizens rarely referred to it. They might
boast about many things—their language,
their literature, and their Art —but as regards
supremacy in the battlefield, that was too
obvious ! When the earth rose up and fell
about his ears, the Frenchman had suddenly
to readjust his whole attitude towards life-
He had to modify his nature and change his
habits; to put a guard on his tongue and
revise his national songs; to cease talking
of “glory,” and dream, instead, of rehabilita-
tion—or revenge. Where he used to be free-
handed—feeling that, by virtue of the Army,
his country had the world at its feet —he
became nenurious, as men are whose confi-
dence in their capacity to command what
they want has been shaken. There is real
pathos in a study of the difference between
the spirit in which the French went to war
last August and that in which they rushed
to it a century ago. The change represents
45 years of the worst sort of humiliation
that a proud people can suffer; and the
alchemist was Defeat. It is this possibility
that Australians, in common with other
Britishers, are viewing with cheerful care-
lessness to-day. No one will pretend that
the British Empire can be wiped out. Such
things do not happen. The enemy may gain
a sort of a win, and yet be as poor by com-
parison with Britain, a decade lienee, as he
was before the war. But if that happens
no Australian or Scotsman or South African
or other white inhabitant of the Empire
will be able to again hold his'head high in
the company of a German. Our drama, our
poetry, our songs, and our proverbs will
need to be recast as a prophylactic against
(he justifiable deris'on of the foreigner. The
racial pride which has become a part of all
but the utter degenerates amongst us will
have to be laid as.cte ; and the operation will
hurt. The avoidance of the possibility of
such a horror is worth many race-meetings
and several football matches. It is worth
every saermee and every effort that a people
can make.
THE AXE THAT LABOR WON’T USE.
The advantage of doing things twice over to
obtain a single result is not clear to the
average citizen. To have a house built by a
crowd of workmen responsible to the owner
and then have it pulled to pieces and recon-
structed by another crowd who may or may
not have learned their trade, but who in any
case recognise no responsibility to the person
for whom the place is being built, would be
regarded as an insane proceeding. Yet this
is exactly what is done in the legislation
of every State in Australia. The Parlia-
ment which sits in Sydney, for example,
is formed on the model of one which grew up
or tumbled together at Westminster, and the
prominent feature of the British institution
is its habit of making laws twice over before
the King is asked to sanction them. Britain
has an excuse for this. There was a time
when the King was absolute maker of all
laws; but in the process of the years this
monarchical power came to be tempered by
the recognition of the rights of the big
landed proprietors or peers to have a say
in the conduct of the national business.
Then the people rose and clamored to get
their fingers in the pie, and at last the Com-
mons were allowed their own elective assem-
bly, in which, as long as they pleased the
King, they could talk to their heart’s con-
tent, and even propose measures and pass
Bills. But it would never have done to let
the Commons have a free hand. The work
they did must be done over again by the
Beers before it was presented to the King,
or thrown out altogether if it looked dan-
gerous to the interests of hereditary
authority. Thus the people were given the
appearance of power, and the glorious British
Constitution came to be a beacon-light of
progress—the sort of progress that doesn’t
get forward, but always feels that it could
if it wanted to. Gradually the Commons
have acquired some real power and their
House has become the source of all the most
important British legislation; but the double
form of the Legislature remains when its
original meaning has passed away. Of this
double Legislature the Parliaments of N. S.
Wales and the other States are more or less
faithful copies. The imagination of the
framers of new Constitutions could never get
the length of breaking away from old forms,
and so an Upper House, as it is humorously
called, was provided in countries where such
a Chamber could have no meaning, purpose
or utility. Thus the legislation of N. S.
Wales must be passed twice over because
centuries ago the King and hereditary nobles
were afraid of putting any real power in the
hands of the people.
* * * *
It sometimes happens that the clumsiest
accidental contrivances of the past acquire
a kind of usefulness which was never in-
tended. The monarchical system, which is
a standing contradiction of democracy, has
in certain cases been found to work better
in connection with democracy than other
systems which look much nearer to the ideal
thing; and even an arbitrary Court of
Equity may broaden down into something
that in days of up-to-date legislation people
can hardly do without. There are any
number of apologists and special pleaders for
an Upper House who argue that that, too,
still has its uses. It is claimed that a
Legislative Council, such as we know the
thing in every State, prevents hasty legisla-
tion and acts as a check upon the too-
enthusiastic representatives of the people.
The plain answer is that the legislative
machinery of the Lower House is so heavy,
cumbersome and tedious that if it does not
serve as a check upon haste a repetition of
the long process of law-making by another
body of men will not do it either. As a plain
fact, based on actual experience, the most
crude and ill-digested measures can and do
get through both Chambers, while things
that are of real urgency, and which should
be placed upon the statute-book with all
speed, are held up and delayed, and, if they
become law at all, do so at last only in a
mangled and distorted form. Again, there
are people who assert that the very
fact of the Upper Chamber representing no-
body gives it a special value in that its
members look at matters with unprejudiced
eyes. But experience has wrecked this argu-
ment also. The people who are appointed
to legislate without being responsible to the
electors are not unrepresentative. They
represent their own interests, their own
associates in life and work, and their legis-
lative power gives an undue advantage to
certain sections of the community and strikes
at the very root of democracy. To sum up
the position of the Upper Chambers through-
out Australia, they are at best useless and
at worst an expensive nuisance. .
All this is generally admitted, and in New
South Wales has become axiomatic among
the supporters of the party that has been
several years in cower. The Labor organisa-
tions one and all are opposed to the Legis-
lative Council, and have decided upon its
abolition; but the thing remains and is per-
petually being added to. Several sessions
ago the P.L.L. Conference gave its Minis-
terial representatives direct orders to go out
with an axe and chop the thing down root
and branch, and those orders have been re-
peated. But the moment the Conference is
over the persons who have been told to get
to work at the destruction mislay their tools,
or forget their directions, or merely wink
and make a speech about establishing a State
laundry or something. A year ago the direc-
tions of the Conference were so explicit that
the Government was actually instructed as
to how it should abolish the Council. All
that is being done is to increase it in size by
the appointment of new members. More-
over, there is not the slightest indication that
Holman really cherishes anything but good
will towards the Legislative Council. He
assured the P.L.L Conference that if it were
the last act of his political life he would keep
his promise by appointing to the Upper
Chamber a certain unnamed person who was
opposed to him politically, but had done
something for the Labor party. Is it to be
believed that Holman would take such a tre-
mendous stand about “rewarding” a man
with a job that was to be brought to an end
as quickly as his Ministry could accomplish
it? The whole affair has become pure
farce and has helped to heap on the Labor
party the mountain of discredit under which
it is now buried. Labor, with the best in-
tentions, set out as a party to smash party
and create a real democracy. It has failed.
Instead of destroying party it has been
caught in the wheels of the old, out-of-date
machine. But the larger movement towards
a fuller democracy cannot long be delayed.
The abolition of the Legislative Council and
of other obsolete and useless things is not
likely to become an accomplished fact until
party government is itself destroyed; for it
is party government alone that has use for
these things.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The World’s Rouseabout.
Tiie first section of the Inter-State Commis-
sion’s report on the tariff was published last
week. It is a depressing effort. According
to the Commission “it is impossible to antici-
pate that the remarkable progress of manu-
facturing industries in the last five years can
long continue in the same ratio.” Also “it
cannot be anticipated that in the open mar-
kets of the world Australia can successfully
compete with the manufactured products of
cheap labor.” And, finally, “fortunately
Australia is offered the possibility of un-
limited expansion in agricultural, mining and
pastoral industries.” It is like a whiff from
the old, dead days when Freetrade was an
issue in Federal politics, and the theory was
prevalent in Conservative quarters that for
Australia to aspire to produce anything but
sheep and hides was not only presumptuous
impudence but also a form of disloyalty to
the Motherland. Why in the name of blither
can’t Australia hope to go on progressing as
a manufacturing country? Germany, with
huge war taxes and few natural advantages,
has been doing it for half a century; the
U.S.A., with huge Trust taxes and natural
advantages which, at the best, are no greater
than those of Australia, is still doing it.
Why must this country always be the world’s
handy man and rouseabout? Why can’t it
summon up the nerve to accept its obvious
destiny? Far from being satisfied with the
miserable progress which it has made of
recent years, Australia, if it hopes to live
nationally, will shortly have to set itself a
considerably higher industrial standard. The
measure of what it ought to be making at
this time of day is, roughly, the amount of
manufactured goods which it has been import-
ing from abroad. In particular, that im-
ported stuff which has been made up—occa-
sionally on a union wages basis, more often
by sweated labor —from local raw products.
Boots are easy to make, yet in 1912 we
imported boots and shoes to the value of
£138,915 from the U.S.A., and sent _ that
country hides and skins worth £45S,935. In
that year we bought apparel and textiles as
follows: From Germany, £1,915,135; from
France, £932,607; from Belgium, £254,697;
from China, £133,854 ; from Japan, £484,449 ;
from Switzerland. £S65,265. In the same
year we sent to Germany alone wool to the
value of £5,050,974. Australia spends a
good deal of its life exporting coal,
timber, zinc and lead concentrates, copper
and other ores, and all the neces-
sary materials for clothing, feeding,
housing and burying itself. And it puts in
most of the rest of its existence dragging back
the goods, at vast expense, in the form of
such things as shirts, blouses, tinned meats,
hearses, coffin-handles, motor-cars, girders,
furniture, dried fish, preserved milk, mouse-
traps and matches. It is a horrible thing
for a country which has, at election after
election, declared loudly for Protection, to be
told by a responsible body of investigators
that the home production business has, if
anything, been overdone ; that Australia must
expect to import more than ever in the
future; and that the cheap foreigner is an
unbeatable trade enemy. The cheering fea-
tures of the situation are the facts that the
Inter-State Commission doesn’t voice the sen-
timent of Australia, and that Parliament
knows it. Even if the worst happens, and
Parliament turns out not to know it now,
the electors are not likely to leave members
in error for many more years.

Fiscal Archaeologists Go Delving in the
Tomb.
Obiter dicta by the Inter-State Commission
in its report to the Federal Parliament: —
It seems hardlv reasonable that common-place in-
dustries, employing the poorest of labor, at the poor-
est rates of wages, should receive as much assistance
as, and at times greater assistance than, many
industries of supreme importance which employ the
highest skilled labor on articles of intricate work-
manship.
Why? It is the industry struggling along in
mean obscurity for which protection against
a foreign competitor is most urgently needed.
The Yard.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The small gains of the Allies are not without their
significance. —Daily paper.
We gained a yard. The foeman somehow
blundered.
We saw the chance and made him yield
us ground.
And at the close of day we grimly wondered
What blows we needs must strike till
peace was found.
We gained a yard; and in our ragged files
Remained the hope to win four hundred
miles!
We gained a mile. The plan concealed and
cherished
By those strong leaders at whose- word we
fought
Matured in deeds. War-shattered columns
perished,
And through the storm a thing of praise we
wrought.
We gained a mile, but every yard was red
With our best blood and carpeted with dead.
We gained a yard—a mile —a league. And
onward
We pressed unflinching at the foeman's
heel.
Weary of heart and hand, but facing dawn-
ward
We compassed victory with flame and
steel;
Till ruin, working at our strong behest,
Wrought surest peace and bade the nations
rest.
We gained a yard, and in that bitter gaining
Our best and bravest at the onset fell;
Where shards of pain from iron throats were
raining
They died, and none could tell them it
was well.
But we who lived till the last trumpet call
Knew that the yard they gained was key to
all.

Two examples of industry may be taken for
purposes of illustration —the manufacture of
pants and of locomotives. Pants are distinctly
commonplace things —two cylinders of
tweed, some buttons and thread. Locomo-
tives are intricate affairs requiring a nice
adjustment of many parts in order that the
assembled whole may work effectively. Yet
pants, commonplace though _ they may be,
are of an importance challenging even that of
the other affair produced by “the highest
skilled labor.” Men, according to the custom
of the time, must be concealed in trousers
before they can either build engines or ride
in trains ; and the makers of pants have for
a long while been regarded as entitled to pro-
tection in their industry against the garment
of exotic birth. If they had not they would
be eking out a miserable existence in insani-
tary dens, vainly offering the product of their
labor at the doors of warehouses filled to
the roof with leg coverings from Hamburg
and The Bowery. In that case the makei's
of this novel fiscal principle would insist
upon them either remaining in their wretched
indigence, or taking to the manufacture of
electrical devices for synchronising clocks —
which would, of course, be both humorous and
disastrous. Asa matter of fact, it is the
commonplace industries that require the most
watchful care from framers of a tariff, for
these are the industries which yield the
largest volume of goods required by the com-
munity, feel the greatest pressure from out-
side competition, and offer the widest field
for the employment of labor. The whimsical
idea put forward by the Commissioners is
really the enunciation of a well-known and
long-ago-played-out CouoEN-ist doctrine. If
the tariff were swept away, and our ports
opened to free bombardment by over-sea
manufactures, all Australian manufacturing
industries would collapse, such workers as
were employed being only kept from starva-
tion by accepting the microscopic wages cur-
rent at Rotterdam and Madras. How would
the Commissioners’ dogma apply to such a
situation? All industries being then poor
and miserable, it would, according to this re-
markable proposition, be “hardly reasonable”
to make them anything else. If the people
wanted work, they could easily turn to and
become makers of, say, mathematical instru-
ments and volatile gases. It is not along
these grotesque lines that Australia has
directed Parliament to get busy : nor was it
for a futile digging up of skeletons, long
grown mouldy, that the Inter-State Commis-
sion draws its screw. By the way, what
was the Commission appointed for?
In the Name of Justice —likewise
Empire.
The Commonwealth Government’s investiga-
tion into the hair-raising charges aimed
by Anstey, M.P., at the officers and men
—officers especially—of the Rabaul contin-
gent is “to be begun as soon as possible,
and carried through to the end whether
pleasant or bitter.” What now chiefly con-
cerns the Commonwealth, both in the inter-
ests of the country and of the accused, is
that the latter shall get a fair deal. They
must be given every chance to clear them-
selves if they are innocent, and they must
be given rational sentences if they turn out
to be guilty. The way to achieve neither of
these ends is to hand them over to a military
tribunal. McWilliams, M.P., scenting from
afar, apparently, the possibility of a civil
inquiry, said challengingly to the Assistant
Defence Minister: “I suppose that among
your officers you have some who will see
that justice is done.” To which Jensen
replied eagerly: “Hear! Hear! We have
not got so low that that cannot be claimed.”
They were both talking irrelevantly. The
moral elevation of the commissioned section
of the army has little to do with the case.
The typical officer’s incapacity to handle an
affair of this sort is a matter of lack of
training first, and of certain congenital
disabilities afterwards. There are not many
professional duties which call for so much
steady practice as the eliciting of evidence ;
the admission of what is fair testimony, and
the rejection of what is not; the welding of
the result into a coherent whole in the form
of an impartial summing up; and finally
and most vital of all, the passing, if the
need arises, of a sentence which is neither
vindictive nor over-lenient. An amateur
will not expect, unless he is a megalo-
maniac, to make a decent hand of such a
job. And of all amateurs the soldier is
probably the most inherently incompetent.
As regards the issue raised by Anstey, a
professional soldier could no more bring an
open and unbiased frame of mind to it
than a surgeon could bring a cool head and
a steady hand to a serious operation on one
of his own children. An officer would be
something more than human if he were not
keenly anxious that the accused of his own
rank should establish their innocence: and,
in the event of their failing to do so, he
would not be a soldier if he refrained from
taking a furiously exaggerated view of
their guilt. The officer is well enough to
mete out punishment for military offences;
but at handling the complicated system
which centuries of experience have shown
to be the fairest and best for determining
the guilt or otherwise of persons accused of
civil offences, he is necessarily a child. If
the Government wants an outbreak of irrele-
vant mud-slinging, followed, probably, by a
glaring miscarriage of justice, it will hand
this case over to the inexperienced conduct
of the army; if, on the other hand, it wants
a neat, brisk, workmanlike investigation, con-
ducted on expert lines, it will call in one cr
more Supreme Court Judges. That, besides
more certainly securing justice in this par-
ticular case, would give prospective expedi-
tionaries more confidence than they could
have if they believed themselves liable to be
tried for civil offences, of which they might
be wholly innocent, by men whose training,
so far from being in the law, actually un-
fitted them for exercising judicial functions.
Freetrade on its Last Legs.
The most audaciously “British” argument
ever uttered against Protection came from
Sir Alfred Moritz Mond, when the national
dyeworks proposal was discussed in the
House of Commons. Mond told the House
he was dead against any such scheme,, and
wouldn’t put a penny into it, seeing that the
Germans hereafter might get within the
British “Protection ring” and “establish
works to compete with us in England.” Now,
this is just what Dr. Ludwig Mond did in
Freetrade Britain long ago. Old-man Lud-
wig came to England and established there
the Bbunner and Mond works, which now
employ thousands of Britons. The object
of Protection anywhere is to establish local
industries for the employment of local labor,
and in order to make the country as far as
possible a self-supporting world unto itself.
And this is without immediate regard for the
nationality of the boss of the works. There
is not one very old-established industry in
Britain that wasn’t introduced by aliens in
the historic past. No matter where an in-
dustry may spring from, its nationality is
ultimately determined by its position and its
workers. Assuming that dye-works in
Britain will be set up by German capitalists,
and will thrive under Protective legislation,
they will not become less British in the future
than the Brunner and Mond business, any-
how. Yet Alfred Moritz Mond, M.P., pro-
tests against the proposed manufacture of
dyes in England on the ground that, if the
industry be protected, it will cause dyes to
be manufactured locally by Germans who
hitherto have manufactured them in Ger-
many. Under the Freetrade system all the
dyes used in Britain were made in Germany;
therefore Moritz Mond denounces, in the
sacred name of Patriotism, a scheme for get-
ting those dyes made in Britain! The atti-
tude of this typical Freetrader and Privy
Councillor would be absurdly humorous if his
name were Benjamin Brown. It makes
one think harder seeing that his name is
Moritz Mond, and his father was Ludwig.
The Hospital Saturday Fraud.
If there is one thing more than another
which should not be left to the chance
generosity of the public in the streets it is
the care of the sick. The first asset of any
State is the health of its people, and the first
call upon the public purse should be for the
upkeep of the hospitals by whose means
disease is kept in check and the ailing por-
tion of the community cured or relieved. But
N. S. Wales goes on in the old, slipshod
way, and the State steadily sidesteps its
duty. This might seem strange in the light
of the fact that a Labor Government is in
office; but it is not strange to those who
have traced the course of that Government
from the time it got there. Fat is still
master of the situation. To support and
equip the hospitals from State funds would
mean taxation equitably collected; to leave
the hospitals mainly to chance coins collected
by the smile-power of girls in the street is
to put the chief burden upon those least able
to pay. The disgrace of the thing is hidden
under the cloak of charity, and Sydney toler-
ates the iniquity and nuisance on the ground
that it is “for a good cause.” If the sweet
young things who rattle the boxes in the
street could be made to see that in doing so
they are parties to a swindle, it might rob
them of some of their enthusiasm. But how
can they be made to understand while the
respectable fathers and uncles of some of
them, in the interests of their bank accounts,
encourage them to bandy doubtful jests with
baldheads and sell their smiles at the street
corners? Many, of course, engaged in the
disreputable business are the daughters
merely of grocers and land agents, but Jane
Smith, despite the growth of democracy, will
still follow Evangeline Fitzboodle and
thus fashion works to defeat decency. Some
day a Government will gaol without distinc-
tion all women soliciting alms in the public
streets. But by that time the rich will be
paying their fair share towards the upkeep
of the hospitals, and won’t send their daugh-
ters out to cadge.

Sawbones and His Patient and the Bill.
“Nil,” who goes out calling with a stetho-
scope, has been irritated by reading some-
where or other that “the poor widow’s pit-
tance was eaten up by medical expenses” :
Of the working population 90 per cent, belong to
some lodge. A lodge is an association formed lor
the purpose of getting cheap doctoring. It gets it.
A man and his wife and any possible number of
children under 16 years old pay 255. a year for
medical attendance on the lot, including medicines
and appliances. All fractures and dislocations have
to be attended to and minor surgical operations per-
formed for this sum. For a confinement the fee is
£2 25., or the lady goes into a lying-in home. In
any case, the Commonwealth gives her £5 ss. The
public hospitals (where no one pays anything), the
babies’ hospitals (where there are no fees), appear
to be forgotten by writers of fiction about “doctors’
fees.” We doctors make a living, of sorts, out of the
people who have a little proper pride and decline to
tap the public pocket for things they can afford to
buy with cash. Those people who are honestly
unable to pay are provided for better than any-
where else in the world. I’m sick of hearing about
“doctor’s fees.”
Which is all very well in its way, but
doesn’t cover all the ground. Generally
speaking, the medical profession in Aus-
tralia has as much to be thankful for as
those people referred to by “Nil” as being
“provided for better than anywhere else in
the world’ 1 ; for where else do the rank and
file of physicians and surgeons browse on
more succulent pastures? The financial re-
turn to practitioners of medicine is not on
the average less than to men in other pro-
fessions. It is perhaps greater—and rightly
so. In individual cases it is certainly very
much greater. And if it be true that the
lodge system is abused, it is also true that,
without some such system, even more of
the community than at present would rely
on cheap quacks for advice, and be hustled
over the Styx by those conscienceless
harpies. There are the further considera-
tions that the ledge patient frequently
gets much less than he pays for, and that
the citizen of average earnings who sum-
mons a medical man does so at the peril of
being grossly overcharged if he is not a
member of a lodge. No body of men do
more for nothing than doctors, as a class;
yet in spite of that there are none who will
blister a patient with a larger bill for trifling
service. The existence of lodges is the
direct consequence of this. Between a per-
son without a bean and a man in ordinary
circumstances the medical profession draws
the distinction that the former should be
admitted to a public hospital free, but that
the other is doing something outrageous if he
seeks by private or State co-operation to get
service, not gratis, but at a rate in reason-
able relation to his ability to pay. Much
of the trouble would of course be got over
if the State took a larger hand in the affairs
of the profession and of the management of
hospitals. If there were establishments
where wharf laborers could obtain treatment
for gout, and clerks for muscles strained by
lifting ledgers—where the parting, with an
appendix might be accomplished in appro-
priate privacy—all on the basis of moderate
charges, there would be less grumbling by
medical men and fewer “wealthy” members of
friendly societies. For in the main those
bodies are now composed of people whose
membership represents a fair attempt to
secure protection at a point where experi-
ence shows it to be badly needed.
Little Bethel’s Admiration of Defence.
“Quill,” who every day finds his morning
newspaper sprinkled with fiercely-worded
resolutions about the war passed by Baptist
Unions and Methodist Conferences and
Kirk Presbyteries:—
What has happened to make these pious Peace
people barrack so furiously for defence —of Bel-
gium? How reconcile, except by assuming original
insincerity, those anti-defence resolutions of a year
or so ago with applause to-day of the gallantly
futile resistance offered by Belgium? It was the
idea of saving Australia from ever suffering the
agonies of Belgium that gave birth to the Common-
wealth scheme of preparing for defence against
assault. That defence can only be made on the basis
of material strength. An enemy would think twice
of visiting a country where the population lurks
round the beach ready to stick him with a bayonet,
but wouldn’t think at all if he knew the only oppo-
sition likely to be met with was a hymn of hate or
a resolution of remonstrance. One Baptist Union
has just been “applauding the action of the brave
Belgians in holding inviolate their chief national
treasure —ran untarnished escutcheon.” In one sense,
quite right and a hopeful indication of repentance in
Little Bethel. In another sense, hopeless bathos.
Supposing Australia stood naked to the world—she
does, unhappily, in part—and the conqueror’s foot
came down and some of the population were fight-
ing, ragged and verminous, with their backs to the
wall away in the West, while the remainder were
reduced tc the plight of starving crows, what would
be the use of resolutions about escutcheons passed
by people who had preached Against the manhood
getting ready to repel such a calamity ? Is it not a
fact that Belgium is in the soup to-day because she
listened to the guttural voice of the pacifist who
charmed her fears away? That had the manhood of
Belgium stood ready to fight they would not have
been attacked? That, what is of more importance
than her escutcheon being inviolate, her women
would have been inviolate, too? Therefore I appeal
to these Unions and Conferences of Presbyteries to
come down from their perch and tell the people of
Australia to take to heart the lessons of to-day and
stand firm in their determination not to allow on
the soil of their country a repetition of the tragic
history of tom and bleeding Belgium. Or are they
going to join the pious editor in a variation of his
creed: “I do believe in fightin’ hard —as far away
as Europe is” ?
The Race Destiny of New Guinea and
Thereabouts.
“Lagani-Namo” corrects some mile-a-minute
observers: —
Since Australia wrested various islands in the
mid-Pacific from Bill 11. a number of those who
assisted in the operation, with a few months experi-
ence of the conditions of the new lands under the
worst of conditions, have opined that “they are not suit-
able for occupation by a white race.” It looks like
an excuse to absolve those responsible for an excessive
sick-list. Unfortunately there is not a sufficient per-
spective of statistics, but such medical and other
reports as are available go towards refuting the
irresponsible and unauthoritative allegations of the
casual soldier, or tourist. Dr. Goldsmith, formerly
Chief Medical Officer of Papua, reported: “Though
we have maladies common to all tropical climates,
we have escaped such diseases as typhoid and scarlet
fevers, measles and diphtheria—always present in
temperate regions. Malaria here is usually of the
benign type, and the seasoned colonist pays little
more attention to an attack than an ordinary indivi-
dual does to a cold in the head.” His successor
corroborates his views: “I ant of opinion that the
general health of New Guinea compares favorably
with other tropical countries. Port Moresby and
Samarai have more healthy climates than most N.
Queensland coastal towns.” “The European mortality
of New Guinea compared with other tropical lands
is low,” another medical officer reported. During
the last five years, out of an average population of
1076, there was a death-rate of 9.93 per 1000, which
is very low, even for a temperate climate. Com-
pare other countries during 1912: The Common-
wealth, 11.2 per 1000; England and Wales, 14.6;
Prussia, 17.3; Jamaica, 22.1 ; Ceylon, 32.8. Of the
50 European deaths in Papua during five years the
bogey malaria was responsible for five, blackwater
for three, accidents for four, constitutional disease
for 25, and dysentery for 13, mostly infants and
aged men. A Gazette published under the authority
of Colonel Holmes, as Administrator of the late Ger-
man possessions, draws attention to the low marriage
and birth rates. But the specially awkward circum-
stances of these pioneering outposts must be taken
into consideration before attributing any discrepancies
in such statistics to the insalubrity of climatic con-
ditions. Out of a total male population of 1163 in
“German New Guinea” only 147 are married —and
there are but 140 children of these marriages. “This
conspicuous disproportion,” says the Gazette, “dees
not exactly support the idea of these Pacific Islands
being congenial to the white race.” Now, apart from
the few opportunities offering for marriage, seeing
that four-fifths of the single women there are mis-
sionaries vowed to celibacy, the young man who
gets to these places is essentially an adventurer who,
even if he ever marries, doesn’t anchor himself until
he is well into middle age. But, though he doesn’t ■
marry, the hordes of half-caste youngsters being
fostered at such mission-stations as Yule Island,
Herbertshoe and elsewhere are indubitable (if unedi-
fying) evidence that the climate hasn’t sterilised
him. Physically and mentally, children born in
these islands compare favorably with those of the
temperate climes, and, given equal opportunities,
develop as well. There is a prevailing notion that
fever and ague will always be recurring to anyone
who has ever had malaria. This is utterly falla-
cious. There are missionaries who have lived in
New Guinea for from 10 to 20 years without a holi-
day, and who haven’t had any fever since their fifth
year. I haven't had any during the last five years.
Asa matter of fact, malaria nowadays is only in-
convenient, and the only dangerous fever in the
tropical Pacific is developed with a corkscrew.
The appeal that is being made to the Eng-
lish population to “follow the King” might
well be turned into an exhortation to them
to “follow Australia”; for, in spite of the
bellowing of wowsers and the theatrical reso-
lutions of bishops and imported Governors to
banish beer from their households, the people
of the Commonwealth are the most sober
white nation on earth. This is how the con-
sumption of wine, beer and spirits per head
of population in several countries works out
in gallons, according to the reliable Knibbs :
Britain, 27; Germany, 25 - v Australia, 14.
Therefore, when the local water-waggon con-
ductor rises up anywhere in Australia and
summons the community to climb up
on the box seat because the King wants
them there, he should be told that
the King has merely climbed up along-
side Australia, which has been on the box
seat all the time. What George V. is up
against is a combination of circumstances
having no place in this part of the world.
The appeal of the Crown is not addressed to
a well-fed, open-air-living people, who, in the
mass, consume small quantities of very light
liquor; but is made on behalf of ill-nourished
millions who wallow in booze of high-alco-
holic voltage, with disastrous results (o their
mental fibre and physical efficiency. The
two Iv’s are not addressing themselves to this
country. They have no need to.
“Anti-Paeisite” : Reference in a recent
Bulletin to the practices of the lower
class of agents in selling businesses and
partnerships, directs timely attention to one
of the most glaring swindles carried on in
our cities. Inquiries made in Melbourne
by the writer, who was anxious to purchase
a business, or an interest in one, brought
him into contact with several of the gentry
living on the game, and revealed that; the
bulk of the “businesses” and “partnerships”
advertised as “sound” exist only in the
minds of the agents. The skilful advertise-
ments are framed to trap the unwary. Cases
brought before the Courts in Victoria by
deluded purchasers seeking to recover money
they paid on agents’ misrepresentations in-
variably end in the defendants’ favor. The
agents are too clever for the silly coots who
think they are going to get for £SO a busi-
ness yielding £lO per week profit. Efforts to
expose the machinations through the columns
of the daily press have proved fruitless,
presumably because of the grist which the
several columns of advts. bring to the mill.
The only means of exposing the swindle is
by the appointment of a Royal Commission.
The results would be startling.
4, :
About the most humiliating confession that
a chairman ever had to make to his share-
holders came from W. M. llyndman, of the
Broken Hill North, last week
If the Port Pirie smelters had not been in exist-
ence, the whole of the Broken Hill mines would have
been forced to close down at the outbreak of the
war. It was, therefore, the duty, as it was to the
interest, of the North Cos. to maintain the smelters
as an insurance against such a calamity ever occur-
rirg.
And that doesn’t disclose the whole of the
ignominy of the position in which this and
three-fourths of the Broken Ilill cos. find
themselves. For the sake of an immediate
extra profit of a few pence per ton they not
only weakened Australia by robbing it of
the job of smelting its own ores, but they
gave the job to Germany, and, by providing
it with work and handing over the control
of the metals to it, they did it enormous
service in building up its fighting strength.
For 20 years these unpatriotic cos. have
been thus supplying Germany with bullets
to butcher the British Empire and imperil
civilisation; and the very same class will
do it again the week after war is over if
they are not stopped, first, by prohibitive
import duties and, second, by export duties
on raw products or some other equal device.
Export duties may have their disadvantages;
but a lot of other things have still greater
disadvantages.

From a cocky who is growing wheat and
young Australians: —
If the Ma State’s new Minister for Agriculture
wants to do something of real value for his friends
in the country he might turn his own and the
Education Department’s attention to the Outback sub-
sidised school. The encouragement that isn’t offered
to qualified teachers to take on the job, and the
amount that isn't taught to the pupils, is marvellous.
If a district thinks it can support a school, several
of the parents jointly apply for a subsidy. When the
application is granted the cocky-parents look for a
teacher. If they can’t lay their hands on anyone in
the district to take on the job the Government sup-
plies a list of persons available, and the cockies shut
their eyes and select one. When the teacher arrives
—-usually a girl who doesn’t know anything about
either teaching or the country —she is billeted on to a
neighboring cocky, who is paid usually 15s. a week
(supplied by the parents) for her board and lodging.
Incidentally, the cocky’s idea of what is reasonable
board and lodging is a bit different from the young
lady’s. The school, nine times out of 10, is any-
thing but weather-proof—mostly slapped-up in a
hurry by the parents, .who are r.ot builders —and for
the job of laboring therein at the infant mind the
teacher receives £5 per head per annum for anything
up to 10 pupils. For any number over 10 she gets
nothing. Thus her maximum screw is £SO per
annum. A couple of months is usually sufficient; then
she clears out, and the school is shut down for six
months while another is making up her mind to
hurry along and get rich. The new victim has to go
through it all again. So do her scholars. Mean-
while the city is being loaded up with high schools
and educational reforms —the cocky's youngster is as
neglected as he was 25 years ago.

HOW TO MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW
LONG AND BEAUTIFUL.
If y°u want to make your hair soft, fluffy,
thick, lustrous and luxuriant, here is a
simple five-minute daily home treatment
which is certainly worthy of a trial. Pre-
pare some hair tonic by mixing together 3oz.
Bay Rum, loz. Lavona de Composee, and i
drachm of Menthol Crystals, adding a little
of your favorite perfume. Apply the tonic
thus made freely to the hair, rubbing it well
into the roots with the finger-tips, and then
brush vigorously for a few minutes, using a
medium stiff brush. This will not only make
the hair bright and beautiful, but will eradi-
cate scurf and dandruff and stop the hair
falling out. In fact, within only a few days
it will be found that an entirely new growth
of soft, downy hair has been produced.
The remarkable hair-growing and beauti-
fying properties of this fine hair tonic have
so often been demonstrated that we are not
surprised to learn that leading chemists
everywhere are now supplying the completed
article, put up ready for use in convenient
sprinkler-topped bottles, under the name of
Lavona Hair Tonic; and the manufacturers
are showing their confidence in its unusual
merits by authorising any chemist to give
with each bottle a signed personal guaran-
tee of satisfaction or money back.*
has practically left us without an indus-
trial reserve. So we can’t send the factory
soldier who keeps the field soldier going;
and the war will drag on longer in conse-
quence, and more brave men’s lives will be
lost. How completely the curse of shiftless-
ness has come home to roost!

Defence Department Administration.
That acute business man, R. McC. Ander-
son, who was commissioned to make an in-
quiry into the financial management of the
Defence Department, says that the military
authorities are very bad business organisers.
That and most of the rest of what he says
does not come as a surprise to those who
have had dealings with these people. On the
financial administration, presided over by the
autocratic Finance Member of the Military
Board, the Commissioner jumps with both
feet. His report is that the branch is “in a
disorganised, dissatisfied and unhealthy con-
dition.” The Ordnance branch has had the
assistance for some time past of Army Ser-
vice Corps officers specially imported from
England for the purpose of remodelling and
altering its structure; but they do not seem
to have effected much or anything. Indeed,
the condition of this and other branches
obliges the Commissioner to animadvert
generally on the importing disease as it ap-
plies to this Department. The strictures
will come as balm to the Australian officer.
The foreign article has always been a bitter
pill for him to swallow; and Kirkpatrick,
who was brought in ostensibly to carry out
Lord Kitchener’s scheme, was the bitterest
pill of all. Besides being an importation
himself, he provided good jobs for his impor-
tations, to the exclusion of the native pro-
duct, and he left unregretted and
without one good word for the Aus-
tralians who had worked for him.
While he was here he achieved noth-
ing of consequence in return for his very
comfortable salary—except perhaps that
through him Australia lost that capable
leader of men, General Gordon. This officer’s
case was typical and illuminative. Millen,
whose Government loved the imported man,
gave him his conge. But, being no further
away than Colombo, on his way to England,
when war broke out, he ventured again to
offer his services. Millen curtly cabled that
he was not required. The War Office, on his
arrival in London, however, snapped him up
and gave him a brigade, and it is on the
cards that he will have a division and a step
in rank before long, if he has not already
got it. It is heart-breaking to the Australian
officer to find the few plums of his profession
falling into the mouths of outsiders when
there are insiders available. And unquestion-
ably they have been, and still are, available;
for every job that has been given to an
Imperial officer there could be found here
Australian officers more capable, more ex-
perienced, and (what is all important) with
a knowledge of local conditions and the Aus-
tralian soldier.
Bill and Jim Fix Bayonets at Last.
Last week Australia began to follow the war
news with a different kind of interest. The
struggle suddenly became intimate and per-
sonal, for Bill and Jim and the rest of
them had landed on European soil and were
at grips with the. enemy. The forcing of
the Dardanelles, hitherto regarded as some-
thing spectacular and remote, was at once
transformed into an enterprise to be watched
with anxiety and hope—with the trepidation
made, inevitable by the lurking knowledge
that in the trenches of the Gallipoli penin-
sula many of our lads would find soldiers’
graves. Their landing appears to have
been effectively carried out, and in the sub-
sequent fighting the troops bore themselves
with steadiness and courage. The avail-
able particulars are of the scrappiest nature,
and even these have been grudgingly re-
leased. At. the time of writing casualty
lists are dribbling into the newspapers; but
whether the losses among Australian and
Maoriland troops have been heavy, moderate
or trifling, not a word is forthcoming. This
discloses a shocking ineptitude somewhere.
Minister for Defence Pearce has promised
to make representations to the War Office
on the subject, with the purpose of altering
a deplorable system, under which the fictions
of the Turk are given more prompt circu-
lation than British despatches on which
reasonable reliance may be placed. Mean-
while the effort to hack and blast a way
through to Constantinople is proceeding;
and as. resistance from great numbers of
Turks is certain, the Australians are likely
to have some stirring experiences. In
Flanders the position shows little altera-
tion, though a fierce struggle was being waged
a day or so ago for possession of trenches
occupied by the Huns, after gallantly poison-
ing the Allied troops on the northern sector
of the trench line. German troops are re-
ported to have appeared in the Baltic pro-
vinces of Russia, the Grand Duke Nicho-
las is still slowly pushing the Austrians off
the Carpathians, and troops are mobilising
on the Italian-Austrian frontier. The
usual stories have been published about Ger
many calling up her last reserves, and beinj
short of sausage or something, but all thesi
may be put aside for attention when th<
general position gives them an air of greate:
authenticity.

“The Man Who Stayed At Home” is a
genuinely entertaining polite bellowdrama,
specially made in time of war for patriotic
playgoers. If there are any spies left in
Sydney it will make them hop with rage,
for their stage imitators are prize lunatics
and mention of the Iron Cross gets the loud
laugh of scorn. It is said that a lot of the
real spies now in England are fools and
bunglers and are despised by the police. If
they are anything like the Sydney Royal
variety the Empire is quite safe. The spies
who operate the crackling wireless in the
chimney of the English seaside boarding-
house, where the Stay-at-Home giggled away
his days and cleaned his pipe with his pre-
sentation white feather are supposed to be
extra-dangerous. Nevertheless, they make
all the old mistakes, and the spruce young
Admiralty traitor even forgets his own
loaded automatic when, 10 minutes before
the end, he succeeds in bailing up the idiot-
diplomatist and getting his unloaded re-
volver from him. Even when the spy-
waiter’s Berlin-bound carrier pigeon is shot
by the diplo-idiot with his walking-stick
airgun, the spy-asses leave him unmurdered
and his room unsearched. They don’t even
upend him to see if anything incriminating
will fall out of his pockets. Under the
circumstances, what can the Fatherland’s
lurking submarines do but go under to the
British cruisers that have been called up
to attend to the job? As well as the chim-
ney wireless that crackles like sheet-tin
when all the boarders are abed, there is a
dictophone in a cigar box which is left on
tables and carried round casually amongst
the spies by the diplo-idiot and his hand-
some lady-assistant, whose splendid board-
ing-house gowns would get her closely
watched even in a first-class hotel. The
attempted pathos of the play is that the
cheerful spy-catcher who uses the white
feather for pipe-cleaning purposes may not
explain to his pained and wondering girl
why he isn’t at the Front. He isn’t
allowed, like the ’tec in a bygone Willie
Collier farce, to rush in saying, “I’m a
secret service man! Don’t tell anybody,
will you?” He is only allowed to hint it
to his sweet, innocent girleen in a loud,
obvious way when his plans are maturing.
Of course, all the dangerous characters are
arrested, at the finish, while the bomb that

Frank Harvey, as the Man —a deliciously
fat part—gives a good imitation of the well-
bred, conventional stage idiot. He is in-
dined to overdo the silly laugh that goes
with the character, but is otherwise up to
sample. Eily Malyon courageously makes
herself look dowdy and sallow as an embit-
tered German old-maid governess, who does
her feeble best for the Fatherland with a
harbor sketch-book. She is incisive and
natural. Leslie Victor this time is a vici-
ous light-weight waiter with ambitions to be
a real murderer of men. Cyril Mackay is
a little heavy as the young Admiralty traitor;
Arthur Cornell, pursuing his special line of
business, supplies an amusing study of an
explosive old J.P.; Lizette Parkes is charm-
ingly dainty as his daughter and the diplo.
idiot’s devoted little girl; and Emma Temple
looks far too good-natured and comfortable
to be the murderous she-German she is cast
for. Violet Paget is decorative as the dip.’s
lady assistant; Martin Lewis is suitably
commonplace as the loyal young English
volunteer; and Dorothy Cumming, the sweet
and undiscriminating distributer of white
feathers, disappoints everybody by not mak-
ing a second appearance and looking foolish.

All attempts on the part of General
Satiety to dislodge the pantomime from its

Sydney, have failed. Arthur Stigant and

“Too Much Johnson” will leave nobody
lamenting when it is removed from the
Palace (Sydney) by Allen Doone on Fri-
day. The following night “The Parish
Priest” will be revived. It will last for six
nights, and then another new piece is to be
tried out —“O’Shea, the Rogue.” With
that the season will close ; Doone will
descend upon Maoriland, and E. J. Carroll
will move Graham Moffat into the Palace
with “A Scrape of the Pen.”

The Tivoli threatens to boom mightily
next week with three stars of over-the-aver-
age candle-power. Julius Knight will ap-
pear for one week, for the benefit of the
Belgian Day Fund, to which he will donate
all his screw; J. J. Corbett will remain on
the pay-list; and Nella Webb will re-appear.
The Bulletin suggests that Nella, who on
her last visit just about broke the Australian
record for farewell performances, begin right
away and catalogue her first performance
Farewell Season No. 1. This would simplify
matters and might help her to add to her
own figures of a year or so back.
Sydney's Salon de Luxe commenced
business for the season at the old stand at
the ankle of William-street on Saturday
night in the presence of a fashionable rag-
time congregation. Deacon J. C. Bendrodt
conducted the service. The Revival gather-
ings will be continued regularly, and ham,
oysters, pickles and other fruits of the sea-
son will be provided for sinners who do the
right thing by the offertory.

Arnold Bennett’s “The Great Adventure”
is the longest and one of the most amusing
productions of the Melbourne Reper-
tory Theatre up to date. As a
dramatised variation of the author’s
clever novel, “Buried Alive,” it seems
comparatively weak and unconvincing
in the first act, where the famous artist gets
rushed into taking the identity of his dying
vaiet, but comparatively strong in the clos-
ing scenes, where the hero’s identity is in-
geniously re-established without resort to
legal proceedings, as in the novel. Even on
the cramped stage of the Athenaeum Hall
the comedy is broadly effective most of the
time, although the lay-out and furnishings in
two of the scenes are conspicuously inade-
quate. Staged in a theatre, with a few im-
provements in the cast, “The Great Adven-
ture” should go quite as well as “The Doc-
tor’s Dilemma” and “Man and Superman,”
which have been about the happiest of full-
sized Repertory shows thus far.
* * * *
For no apparent reason the names of the
characters in the novel are changed in the
comedy, Priam Faryll,. the painter, is con-
verted into Ilam Carve. Leek, the valet, is
presented in his original moribund condition
as Albert Shawn. Alice Challice, the cheer-
ful, soothing, matter-of-fact widow to whom
the eccentric genius turns for matrimonial
comfort and seclusion, is Janet Cannot in
her dramatised form. And so forth. Gre-
gan McMahon and his amateur associates
mostly make a good job of their tasks. Him-
self, admirably disguised as usual, gets fairly
inside the character of the man whose
natural aversion to the social inconveniences
ot notoriety, allied to a craving for the
simple domestic life that he has never
experienced, leads him into an absurd
predicament. Whilst his deceased valet
sleeps the sleep of the vulgar under
a epitaph in Westminster, the
real Maginnis is relishing four meals
a day in a suburban London villa, tended
by a nice, squeezable matron who accepts his
statements of personal fact as harmless hal-
lucinations. McMahon suggests the painter
and the man. He warms to his part as he
goes along, and slips easily into audaciously
cheerful cynicism in the final act, which runs
on Bernard Shaw lines. Miss Allie Robson
is very likable in the grateful part of Janet,
a trifle too festive and refined, but effective
enough in every situation. Miss Tuson is
quite the right sort of girl to realise the
gushful Honoria Looe, and she acts intelli-
gently. The last act brings Helton Daniell
into striking evidence as the tall, tactful lord
wko es things pleasant; and among the
other Repertorians the best suited are Hugh
Rose, g. Halroyd, Newson, Atherton, Cun-
mnghame and Miss Betty Baker.

“The Trojan Women,” translated from the
Greek by Gilbert Murray—brother of Aus-
tralia s representative in Papua—and
musicked by Marshall Hall, is the Reper-
tory bill for Saturday and two nights
next week. An orchestra of 50 and more
will assist the familiar legendary characters
thiough their stately lines and poses, and
the incidental women of Troy are expected
to lend a lot of picturesque charm to a bald,
impressive narrative.

«T> At j ll * s Melbl R °y al . the success of Niblo in
Broadway Jones” is not affected by his
own shortcomings as an actor at the begin-
ning of the piece, or by the painful mushiness
of its sentiment at the finish. Niblo when
he first arrives is supposed to be too drunk
to know Cambourne when he talks to him,
although C.ambourne’s nose is one in a thou-
sand- The time is 5 a.m., and Niblo’s state
ot alleged inebriety is said to be only one
m an unbroken series of extravagant jags,
yet lie looks as irreproachably trim as a
draper s assistant, and his endeavor to seem
unsober wouldn’t deceive a policeman. As
tor his final dissertation on the wonders of
Broadway, it sounds like a parody on Tup-
per’s Proverbial Philosophy. With eyes gaz-
ing entranced into vacancy and voice tuned
to soliloquatic strains, Niblo informs Miss
Bennett that Broadway is a wondrous
thoroughfare, where millionaires wear shabby
hats, whilst poor men wear new bell-toppers •
where good women have bad colds and bad
women have good bank balanceswhere
young men grow old, and old men grow
queiulous, etc., And poor ATiss B. is ex-
pected to stare at these strings of platitudes
as though they were pearls.

War was declared between Danubia and
Carpathia at Melbourne Princess’s on Satur-
day, and when this edition went to press the
decrepit army of the former was smiting the
enemy hard on the rear and providing over-
time for burial parties. Relations between
the two States had been previously strained
by the efforts of the traitorous Baron Strel-
sau to push the reigning boss of Carpathia
on to the empty throne of Danubia. Car-
pathia is actually feeling his way to the
vacancy with a liberal expenditure of back-
sheesh and poison, when George Cross digs
up the solitary feminine survivor of the
Danubian dynasty and plants the crown on
her royal head. Thereupon the foiled candi-
date offers the lady his fingers in wedlock,
“THE GREAT
ADVENTURE ,”

and when she haughtily declines the dishonor
he orders his cannons to press his suit with
all the vigor that they can command. George
Cross then becomes the Joffre of his country ;
leading his legions to sanguinary victories, he
finishes up by marrying his grateful Queen.
This is a bare outline of “From Convent to
Throne,” whereof Cross is a rather portly
detail, suffering numerous imaginary wounds
through intruding his circumference into the
fray. That the wicked Prince of Carpathia
is also a plump and rounded scoundrel is
John Kirby’s unavoidable error. On the
other hand, Miss Remee is underweight for
the r6le of the Queen, and rarely emerges
from uninteresting fiapperhood. Ronald
Riley’s incisiveness scores in the foolish
character of Strelsau, and Fred Kehoe makes
the most of Simon the woodcutter. There
are numerous others in the cast, but the
only ones calling for remark are Miss Oriel
Hotson, a long-haired mystery in faded finery,
and Miss Nell Holroyd, a weird case of a
humorist rising on stepping-stones of giggle.
The Melb. Tivoli programme contains the
same people as before plus Thorne and Leo-
pold, a couple who put more voice and
variety into their proceedings than the
boosted Dooley and Sales. _ The “famous
specialty” of these two is said to be entitled
“That’s Silly,” but it ought to be called
“Unmitigated Bluff.” Its main strength is
in the ability of Dooley to keep a section of
the audience amused by his confident manner
of making witless remarks in hoarse accents.
Then the little lady, who has a sustained
giggle or chuckle, and a voice like a cry of
pain, brings her complete self-satisfaction to
bear on the turn, and they talk foolish duets
and dally with inane personal gags for the
space of fully 20 minutes. Truly there is
nothing in the wire-drawn item save the
easy assurance of its performers. They pro-
vide an object-lesson in vaudeville art. Hav-
ing practised this precious specialty until
they knew it backwards years ago, no doubt,
Dooley and Sales must have lost all incen-
tive to work. They don’t need to think of
work. Now the versatile George Mozart, on
the other hand, is apt to work a little too
strenuously for his living.
The Strollers are near the end of their

Of a Melbourne art show: —
The Vic. artists are making their annual spread of
net to catch the picture-buyer. Harley Griffiths
hangs the most pleasing portrait, depicting a white-
frocked miss whom the unchivalrous realist has con-
demned to crow’s feet in early life. Max Meldrum’s
“Black Veil” discloses a well-painted smile deriving
small enjoyment from its funereal surroundings.
“The Blonde,” by Clewin Harcourt, shows the artist
recording the obvious with the painstaking accuracy
of a police-court reporter. Miss Teague’s “Queen
Elizabeth,” blazing with old gold and ancient jewel-
lery, looks like the effort of a short-sighted anti-
quarian, but the same lady’s “Andante” is a more
tasteful achievement in the modern manner. In
Miss Cumbrae Stewart’s “Madre,” a weak, in-
conclusive background throws an old lady in
lavender into dowdy' relief. As regards 1 Leslie
Wilkie’s pallid charmers, they ought to be told some
risque stories to bring the color to their cheeks.
W. B. Mclnnes is good in “A Virgin Bush,” but in
his Oriental sketch, “The Eye of the Needle,” he
flourishes a flamboyant art that seems like a cannon
challenging argument. Percy Leason appears to have
lost his bearings in “The Explorers,” but Crozier has
caught some of the bush atmosphere in his various
sketches ; and Harry B. Harrison, in .“The Road
Menders,” has succeeded in his light and shadow
contrasts. “Victi Invicti,” by Ivan A. Rosenblum,
demonstrates that the artist is still barking his shins
on the allegorical, and a lady named Yandell is
trying to find a market for crypts and Botticelli
maidens. Among the various other exhibits, Shir-
low’s etchings and Nicholls Anderson’s “Macedon”
deserve mention with approval; and Shearsby’s irides-
cent seascapes reveal improvement, though a sensi-
tive critic still requires to approach them in a pair
of winkers. One might also mention Albert Enes,
who furnishes some genuinely artistic impressions of
hazy green pastures and nebulous sheep.
Adelaide Repertory Theatre earned some
needed money for expenses by playing a
Schnitzler series to a paying audience. It
was an entirely unconventional evening,
presenting the affairs of the amorous
“Anatol” with Emily the intense, Mimi the
greedy and rather common, and Lona the
crockery-smasher; also, by way of a subtle
change, his dialogue with the virtuous young-
matron who candidly regrets that she is
too great a coward to be as happy as they.
As the second and third of these, Ivy Stacey
and Beryl Kook chiefly scored, possibly
through having more chance of action; in
their cases, too, there was the great help
of the supporting Max, played with a light
but sardonic touch by Ray Walsh. Anatol,
consistent only in inconsistency, used to
be more Viennese in the hands of Royston
Marcus, but the breezy and natural manner
of Douglas Walsh suits the character ad-
mirably.

Adelaide Tivoli has broken out into a
Follies season —of old friends, mostly—
with Jack Cannot prominent. Variety is
his fitting place. The assertive manner
which used to delay the traffic of the stage
is here a valuable asset, and he keeps the
show brisk. At the King’s, where Carrie
Moore had been greatly popular, a plucky
venture is beginning—a pantomime that is
a tight fit for the pretty little house. Ed-
ward Reeves has recited for hungry Bel-
gium, and various people have sung or
played for it. Wondergraph has a picture
of three generations of soldiers, a strong
recruiting film. West’s at last shows the
much-boomed “Cabiria,” full of gore, but
a real play, by a known author. The in-
telligent picture patron tends more and
more to demand something definite, which
one can remember having seen, instead of a
casual assortment.
The death of “Jimmy” MacMahon last
week occurred while brother Charles was in
Sydney preparing the plans for another
MacMahon melodramatic co. to tour Aus-
tralia and Maoriland. “From Mill Girl to

and others, will lead the way.

“THE GREAT
ADVENTURE ,”
AT MELB.
REPERTORY
THEATRE.
—the Empire—announced last week “with
great pleasure” that “owing to the war”
prices are to come down. It didn’t mention
which war.
Clara Butt —Madame Butt-Rumford now,
if you please—has reported the results of
her concert campaign in England for the
war funds. Twenty-five concerts have
enabled her to hand over £7OOO to various
charitable activities, the Queen’s Work for
Women Fund receiving the biggest slice —
£l7OO. “Amazing,” says the London Daily
Telegraph, which acclaims Mrs. Rumford
as the nation’s champion lady hustler in the
cause. The man who has ideas of that sort
when Melba is in the field will next report
the successful chase and capture of a whale
by an iceberg.
“Jape”: The adventures of the Nellie
Stewart company in Maoriland have ranged
from grave to gay. At Wellington Harry
Roberts’s nose commenced to bleed just as
he was making his first entrance as John
Manners in “Dorothy o’ the Hall,” and,
despite furious plugging and plumbing, the
leak refused to terminate. Therefore John
Manners made love to dear Dorothy with a
handkerchief to his nose, and when one piece
of linen became thoroughly incarnadined,
Roberts would sidle over to the wings and
get a fresh rag.
“0.K.” : “Billy” Williams, vaudeville
songster, died in England the other day after
a surgical operation. Australian-born, he
was originally a J. C. Williamson chorister.
Then he started in business for himself at the
halls, went to London, and was already
the “famous ‘Billy’ Williams” when he re-
turned to Australia for a season under
Rickards engagement. The gallery boys loved
him, but a lot of other people only forgave his
“humor” for the sake of his tuneful voice
and happy disposition. “Billy” was never
stationary. He walked to and fro clad in
ornate tailorings, sniggering and singing
songs more or less banal, with always - a
popular chorus attached. The vitality of the
man must have been the secret of his excep-
tional success. Rest his soul!
“Haresfoot”: Lately-dead Mrs. Bernard
Beere first came into notice with Comyns
Carr’s adaptation of Hardy’s “Far From
the Madding Crowd.” With the novelist’s
approval, this was sent to managers Hare
and Kendal, at the St. James’s. They
declined it. Very soon afterwards they
produced “The Squire,” by Pinero. Comyns
indignantly declared that this was an im-
pudent plagiarism from his drama, with
the very same central incident. Pinero as
indignantly denied having seen Carr’s piece.
The infuriated Carr put money in his purse,
and with it produced “Far From the Mad-
ding Crowd” —at the Globe, if I remember
aright. In it Mrs. Beere was triumphant
as Bathsheba Everdene, equalling Mrs.
Kendal as the Squire, or more properly
Squiress, essentially the same character. I
don’t remember Mrs. Beere acting it here,
but have an idea that it was acted by others.
After *“Far From the Madding Crowd,” Mrs/
Beere did well as “Fedora” with the Ban-
crofts, and thus settled into her stride.
“L.H.P.”: Jimmy MacMahon’s death re-
calls the fine work he did in Maoriland ’way
back in the ’Bo’s, when, in conjunction with
George Leitch, he ran a stock dramatic co.
They put up “The Silver King,” with F. C.
Appleton as the King, Maggie Knight as
Nellie Denver, Harry Jewett as “The Spi-
der,” and Leitch as Jaikes. Subsequently
Leitch produced a version of “The Private
Secretary,” under the tile of “The Libra-
rian,” the source of both being a well-known
German play. Later in the year (1885)
MacMahon and Leitch starred Dion Bouci-
cault and Louise Thorndyke in “The Shau-
ghraun,” “Arrah-na-Pogue,” “Kerry,” “The
Colleen Bawn,” and “The Jilt,” with Apple-
ton, Madge Herrick, Robert Vernon, Frank
Gerald and Kate Douglas in the co. In 1888
they introduced “Harbor Lights” and “Hu-
man Nature” to Maoriland. Leitch was a
splendid Tom Dossitor in the first-named
play. “For the Term of Ills Natural Life”
and “The Pearl Divers” were other notable
productions. When MacMahon put up “For
the Term of His Natural Life” in Hobart,
he sent out all the supers, dressed as con-
victs, in charge of two garbed as warders.
It hurt the old town and led to unusual
activity on the part of the police. But
Jimmy had got his ad. by that time.
George Wirth gives Toby a send-off: —
Toby, our big elephant, that died at the Circus
last Thursday, was known as an “outlaw” for many
years. The animal had killed two men before we
bought her, and one after, besides crippling several
others. She objected to be dictated to except by
Captain Burrows, who had bossed her for over 25
years. He could do anything with her ; she was as
docile in his hands as a kitten. She would also do
anything, within reason, for other members of the
company, unless they offended her or tried to “show
off” to bystanders. Then she would toss the offender
aside, gently or roughly, as the case demanded. She
never forgot a wrong. An engineer on a coastal
steamer played a practical joke on her during a
voyage from Brisbane to Rockhampton by throwing
her an orange with the inside stuffed with cayenne
pepper. Toby promptly picked it up and crunched
it in her mouth; then instantly let out a terrific
trumpeting. No one could make out what the
hubbub was about —except the engineer, who laughed
heartily at the success of his joke. The incident was
forgotten by all except Toby. On the return trip,
a fortnight or so later, the engineer, having to pass
the elephants to get to his cabin, was suddenly
picked up bodily in the lady’s trunk and hurled sea-
ward. He would have gone overboard had it not been
for the riggings. When he was raised off the deck
his ribs were crushed. He admitted that it was his
own fault. We wouldn’t have taken £lOOO for
Toby. She was the handiest of the herd.
Manager Courtneidge, thinking the time
unripe for another expensive venture in
musical comedy, recently revived “The Tales
of Hoffman” at the Shaftesbury (Loud.),
with the idea of giving the war-gloomed
population something not too serious yet not
too frivolous. Two members of the original
Quinlan co.- —John Harrison and Samuell —
were engaged.
(Continued on page 42.)
The Federal Reps. liked Maloney’s
amendment to the War Precautions Bill so
well that on reappearing last week it was
agreed to practically without discussion.
In its new form the Bill, instead of giving
the military power to try and imprison
any citizen of the Commonwealth, follovvs
the less objectionable course of giving it
that power over only alien enemies and per-
sons subject to the Defence Act. Yet even this
seems unnecessary. The business of mili-
tary officers is to fight, and the less their
time is taken up with duties of a judicial
character, which they are quite unfitted to
perform, the more likely they are to satis-
factorily do the work they are trained and
paid for.
“Personnel” : The powers given to General
Bridges, who commands the Australian
Expeditionaries in Turkey, are so exten-
sive and arbitrary that interested people
are beginning to ask questions about
them. Bridges has under his direct
command a division of Australians.
But there are ten thousand Austra-
lians out of the division who are not
under his command ; yet he is the only per-
son authorised by the Commonwealth to
make promotion for all Australians. So,
if the G.O.C. Army Corps (General Bird-
wood) wants to promote an officer directly
under another G.0.C., he must actually
obtain the authority of General Bridges to
sanction the promotion. Bridges can also
send back to Australia any officer without
trial or explanation, which is an unheard-of
power to give anyone.
HIS FAT PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mogg was the very fattest pro.
That I have seen attempt to act;
It is not that his head was so,
But Mogg weighed twenty stone, I know,
And as Horatio, in fact,
He filled the part until it cracked.
The actor-manager who played
The Prince with swathes of fat was graced.
In purple robes and gems arrayed,
At a rough estimate he weighed
Good sixteen stone. In corsets laced
He had some semblance of a waist.
I sympathised; but Mogg said: “Nay,
I owe much to my bulk of limb ;
That I have got a job to-day
Is due to the amount I weigh—-
It is the leading actor’s whim
That I am making him look slim.”

IRRESISTIBLE LOGIC.
THE BOY: “Yer ’urting me!”
M UM: “Mum wouldn't hurt you for the world."
THE BOY: “How could you wouldn’t when y’are?”
“Pliax”: The S. M. Herald wrote last
week of the French soldiers advancing on
the Yser Canal “chanting the hymn which
has so often signalled the victory of the
French Republic over an invader.” The
Marseillaise has never yet signalled the vic-
tory of France over an invader. When
Rouget de Lille first rendered it at an even-
ing party given by the Mayor of Strassburg,
France was a monarchy and at peace. With
the death of Louis XVI. and the arming of
Europe against the revolutionists came civil
war. The frontiers were threatened after
the Gironde fell, but were not invaded.
Frenchmen never dreamed of fighting in
their own territory under Napoleon. In
July. IS7O, the unthinkable happened, and
France (which, by the way, was then an
Empire) found itself marching for the first
time against an invader. But the Marseil-
laise was not sung as a signal of victory or
anything else. There was hardly time to
sing; and, anyhow, there were no victories
worth mentioning. By September Louis
Napoleon was in the hands of the Germans.
By October Metz had fallen, and the war
was virtually over. Not till the Germans
who now occupy so much of the North of
France are driven out and over the Rhine
will France’s national hymn signalise the
defeat of an invader.
After close on three years’ steady
thought, the Sydney City Council con-
ceived a bright idea. It had long noted that
the city patrolmen got hardly any convic-
tions—that shop-touts never touted and hogs
rarely spat on footpaths in their presence.
The Council finally reasoned that the phe-
nomenon might have something to do with
their employees’ uniforms. A master
logician among them pointed out that the
burglar notoriously desists from burgling
when ho sees the police approaching, and
that it might be the same in civic affairs.
Half convinced, yet doubting still, the local
Fathers decided to take a chance. The out-
come was not merely a defeat for Misde-
meanor ; it was a debacle. In the glowing
words of the General commanding the
Health Committee :
For the fortnight ended April 12, whilst the patrol-
men were uniformed, 17 persons were reported for
throwing litter on the streets; three for sweeping
litter from premises; and three for illegal bill-post-
ing. For the following fortnight, the officials being
then in private clothes, 56 individuals were reported
for throwing litter on the streets ; 12 for sweeping
litter from premises; six for expectorating on the
footways; and two for illegal bill-posting.
This definitely establishes the correctness
of the theory that policemen who go about
their business quietly are of more use than
those who sound rattles to let malefactors
know they are coming.
SELF-DENIAL.

I’ve given them to the starvin’ Belgians.”

I see by the cables that Hartmann’s Weilerkopf
was taken by the French, retaken by the Germans,
and taken yet again by the French last week. This
experience appears to be chronic with Hartmann’s
property, which must be in a hopelessly chaotic state
by now. In common with other war-experts, I know
nothing of the Weilerkopf estate except that it is
on a hill. I had never heard of it before the war
began. I didn’t even know it was a salient. I will
go further and own that I had no idea what a salient
was. In fact, such was my besotted ignorance, that
I couldn’t have defined, offhand, a point d’appui.
However, that is all over and done with.
To return to the Weilerkopf property. I never
learn that it has had a fresh piece knocked off it, or
another hole drilled in it, without involuntarily con-
juring up a mental picture of its distracted owner.
Sometimes I vision him as a mild old German mug,
who had the doomed place lumbered on to him by one
of the local “heads.” I see him sitting over his beer
in his pleasant home in Dresden. It is 1913, and he
has no idea that war is coming. Enter von Blut-
wurst, who has just had it direct from the Imperial
stable that Der Tag has been fixed for the ensuing
summer. He explains to Hartmann that his family
seat, one of the nicest little country places between
Berlin and Paris, is on the market. Airy position ;
superb view; clay subsoil-; hot and cold water laid
on right through the house ; modern sanitation ; four
magnificent tennis courts, all of reinforced concrete
six feet deep; the lodge gates, within gunshot of a
railway—and all for a cash figure whose moderation
makes the simple old man gasp.
The kaleidoscope changes, and the Weilerkopf has
been Hartmann’s for some months. On the tennis
courts are the 4.7 guns for which they were built.
The house looks as if it had been through a mangle.
The adjacent railway is a wreck. The clay subsoil is
full of corpses. A French shell sings up out of the
summer morning mist, its time-fuze set to a nicety ;
there is a roar and a howl, and the entire sanitary
service of the mansion and 14 Uhlans are blown to
perdition. And amid it all Hartmann crouches in the
semi-security of a distant valley and watches through
a telescope, and tells himself bitterly that he might
have known there was a catch of some sort in the
deal.
Again, I picture Hartmann as a Yid money-lender
who has foreclosed on the Weilerkopf estate to satisfy
a mortgage in regard to which the borrower—a young
man about the Court at Potsdam—-suddenly became
inexplicably indifferent. Hartmann was proud of his
new home. He had just settled down there, and in-
stalled a couple of gilded lions on the front steps, and
turned one of the tennis-courts into a pool-room, and
asked Biedermann, and Heuptfeldt and several more
sporting Sheenies, together with a proper leavening of
Teuton Goyishers, down for the eleventh day of Rosh
Hoshonah. He had just done these things when the
war started. And then suddenly he understood about
the mortgage, and an enraged Hebrew tore wildly
down the hill which he had so lately acquired, and
fell into the valley below, and ran so fast and per-
sistently that the noise of the cannonading' presently
faded from his ears.
“Jeames” and the fambly’s fortunes: —
Apparently Lord Crichton, of the Royal Horse
Guards, who was reported' to have been captured at
Mons, never became Earl of Erne. A cable suggests
that he was killed, after all, before his father died.
The heir is his son, aged about eight. The war will
do a lot to rehabilitate the fortunes of families like
this one, which, while rich according to ordinary
standards, has endless drains on its finances in normal
times. To begin with, all need for entertaining is
gone. The younger sons are either at the Front and
costing little, or getting killed and costing less. The
girls do not need ball-dresses or Goodwood frocks
or trips to Paris or Cairo, because it is the vogue
to stay at home and knit. In pre-war Society in
England the family which economised was lost. Now
lavishness is regarded as bad form. Meanwhile, the
rents are coming to hand as freely as ever. So,
though heirs are disappearing right and left, the
wolf is being hunted from many a noble doorstep,
and mortgage-clouds are lifting which a year ago
seemed fixtures but for the grace of a millionaire
marriage in the family.
When the Victorian irrigation supplies re-
cently ran out, cockydom started squealing
and yelling about giving up the irrigation
blocks in disgust. Attracted by the noise, a
number of land-hungry persons hurried along
to take up the derelict land the squeakers
vowed was worthless. The local official
whose duty it is to take land-seekers around
lost no time in introducing the visitors to the
discontented inhabitants, but nary one of
them would sell —even at his own price. One
of the would-be settlers is a Britisher who
is married to a Belgian. When his farm on
the Belgian frontier began to grow a harvest
of lead and dead lie brought his family to
Australia. lie reckons Victoria, with its
drought, is a glimpse of Paradise after the
taste of Hell he got when the Huns arrived
at the garden gate. Others keen to step in
where the average overseas man says he can-
not make a living are residents of the dry-
farming districts, who reckon that half a gill
of water is better than a dry dam.
THE CLOTHES WE MISSED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Colored clothes for men would have been the thing
this season but for the war. —American magazine.
The guns that rend the European sky
Have kept us black or drab or darkly blue ;
We still may flaunt a green and purple tie,
But coats and trousers wear the sombre hue
Of smoke and roiling war clouds and the gloom
That shadows nations when the great guns boom.
Had Germany withheld her murderous horde,
And kept her sword preserved in vaseline,
To what resplendent colors had we soared,
llow silken gay our manly backs had been —
Yes, through the Kaiser’s noisy game we missed
Cuffs of embroidered scarlet at the wrist!
Like peacocks roosting upon rainbow bends
Our bright male world had filled the thronging
street.
A saffron coat with frilled magenta ends,
And grass-green pants red flounced about the feet
Had been a very modest kind of wear
To grace a bank stool or an office chair.
The man of fashion then had been arrayed
In cloak of tangerine with silver lined,
His turquoise vest made bright with crimson braid,
Ilis shell-pink trousers purple-slashed behind,
And on his head a hat of emerald hue
Trimmed with red poppies and a scarf of blue.
But war foredoomed the promise bright and gay ;
The radiant male is but a clothier’s dream ;
We brush anew the coats of yesterday,
And wonder just how shabby they may seem ;
We hide the patch that Mary deftly sews,
And go in trembling—wondering if it shows.

TO REMEDY THINNESS AND
IMPROVE THE FIGURE.
Ladies who are thin, scraggy and angular,
and lacking in that full, well-rounded devel-
opment which adds so much to any woman’s
charms may accomplish wonders in the way
of putting on flesh, filling up hollow cheeks,
necks and shoulders, and developing the
figure generally hy giving a little attention
to the nervous system. When the nerves are
weak the stomach and other vital organs are
the first to suffer The food eaten is not con-
verted into flesh, and you become thin,
scraggy, anaemic, run-down and despondent.
The seat of trouble is the nerves, which
direct and control the work of the stomach
and liver. They must be strengthened by a
proper nerve food, and you can obtain noth-
ing better for the purpose than Phormoid, a
highly concentrated food product sold by all
chemists. Eat one Phormoid tablet before
meals, and note much better you will
feel after the first day. Weigh yourself when
you start and again at the end of the first
week. You should have gained about 21b. at
the very least.
Caution to Ladies. —Thin ladies who ob-
ject to an increased bust development should
not take Phormoid, as it generally develops
the bust from three to four inches in a few
weeks.*

“De Yid”: In every war there is rape;
but probably never before now lias the offence
been not only condoned but officially sanc-
tioned, The desire to quickly repopulate
conquered territory is probably at the root of
the sanction. Germany is prodigal of men
in all its battles, and to counteract the inevit-
able loss German soldiers were urged to take
brides before they left for the Front. These
marriages were known as “war-marriages,”
and the brides wore rings of iron in place of
the customary gold. In some instances the
ceremony was celebrated over batches of
couples. The result is that to-day there are
thousands of expectant mothers in Germany.
Even when hard put to it to feed its popula-
tion, the Empire of the Hun was always
rapacious for man-babies. The “wish of the
Empress,” publicly expressed in the news-
papers some years ago, is famous. _lt stated
her royal belief that “all girls, married or not,
should enjoy the great and sacred privilege
of motherhood,” and she hoped mistresses
would not enforce too rigid a discipline on
their servant maids. This may, perhaps,
account for tbe Hun proverb that
where there is a servant there are
two mistresses. Illegitimacy has for
very many years been commoner in Ger-
many than anywhere else in Europe,
except Austria. The rate is more than
three times higher than in Britain —seven
times higher than in Ireland. Such things
explain it.

“Bloggs” : It is the perfectly insane that
happens. According to a cable last week —
Moss, the owner of an old manor house at Chiswick
(London), which was raided by the police some time
ago, and where £lOO,OOO worth of stolen art trea-
sures were recovered, has been sentenced to three
years’ imprisonment. The occupier of the house was
engaged in the muffin business.
Moss; an old manor-house at Chiswick,
which is a genteel river suburb on the west
side of London; £lOO,OOO worth of stolen
art treasures (it took one of the city’s great-
est houses to contain the Wallace Collec-
tion, which was valued at little more than a
million) ; and the place in the possession of
a muffin man! About 1 lie same time that
Moss was being sentenced in London Alma
Victoria Thomas, aged 19, was petitioning
in Perth for a separation from her sep-
tuagenarian Joseph. They had given each
other the glad eye in a train. Within 10
minutes he had proposed to her. A couple
of days later they were married. The day
after he took her rings and most of her
clothes, accused her of misconduct with a

fell in. If a novelist wrote such things he
would be called mad; but a reporter can

variably far dottier than Romance. _

cold feet and rheuma-

a long line of desk-

which will only bfe

mandant comes along.
In another part of
the enclosure half a

to salute. Now an
Expeditionary friend
tells me that the offi-
cers of our business-
like foreign legions

like the men by way
of deluding the hos-
tile sniper; also that
any fool-private who
dares to salute and

An amateur “honorarium,” if one may put
it so, happened in Caulfield (Vic.) Court
lately, in a case in which Bobkins charged
Smithlank with language. It appeared that
in the course of conversation Smithlank swore
at Bobkins, of which lapse the latter in-
formed the law, and a summons duly issued.
But before the mandate reached Smithlank
he called on Bobkins and regretted his re-
marks. Bobkins accepted the apologies, but,
as a corrective, “fined” Smithlank 50s. for
the Belgian Fund. Smithlank paid. After
that, the summons arrived, and the humor-
less beaks, instead of jumping on Bobkins
for usurping their functions, “touched”
Smithlank for another 40s. Smithlank is now
considering the case. Should he go for Bob-
kins for compounding a felony, or should he
charge him with levying fines by false pre-
tences, or some other difficult and irregular
misdemeanor? In any case, there are points
about Bobkins’s manoeuvre, and some of the
exploiters of that charity which covers a
multitude of sins might follow it up.

In Sydney a doctor left his car outside
his chambers. Half a dozen young men
came along, more or less sober, took the
vehicle and knocked £lOO off the value of it,
were arrested, tried before Judge Murray,
and discharged, on the ground that they
hadn’t intended to “steal.” So, until the
law is amended—an unlikely contingency,
inasmuch as this state of affairs has existed
in N. S. Wales ever since motor-cars came
into use—the citizen who wants a day’s
outing has merely to commandeer the first
car that strikes his fancy and flit. Where a
man commits what is virtually a crime,
while keeping within the actual letter of
the law, it is usual to get at him from
another angle, so to speak. Thus the
poisoner Dean, having been acquitted on
the capital charge, could not again be pro-
ceeded against—on that charge. The Crown
evened things up by seeing that he served a
life sentence for perjury. In England un-
sober youths who collar strange cars are
charged with the theft of the petrol or lubri-
cating oil, and the magistrate grades his
sentence by a consideration of the damage
done to the vehicle. _ Unless the law in Aus-
tralia acts along similar lines, the country
is likely soon to be full of flying cars, in-
differently driven, and frantic owners talking
assault. It is a weird anomaly that the
very class of property which is‘most liable
to be depreciated by unskilful handling
should be virtually at -the disposal of the
first drunken rioter who conceives the idea
of making use of it.
A Dr. Demck is conducting a Chew-Your-
Food crusade in Berlin. Ilis mission is to
teach the Germans to grind their fodder
thoroughly in order to get the maximum of
nutriment from every grain.
The robbery at Melbourne, when
thieves got away with £4OO worth of
loose change belonging to the Eight Hours’
Demonstration, is only remarkable because a
robbery at a Tracies Ilall is rare, though
Trades Hall are cribs well worth cracking.
When a big union meets not only do numbers
of members pay in coin, but shop stewards
and delegates bring large collections, and
the lot is piled in the safe until next day.
The Sydney Eight Hours’ Committee every
year appoints several delegates as watchmen
to look after the prizes and keen an eye on
the premises generally; but the Melbourne
authorities seem to have relied on the idea
that a robbery of their coin was prohibited
by the rules of the Burglars’ Union.

A little bit of historic Sydney was sold
recently by a city firm. It is in Pitt-street,
on the northern corner of Rowe-street, origin-
ally known as Brougham-place—part of an
original grant to George Grossley, an expatri-
ated attorney, who, during the days of the
Bligh trouble, was legal adviser to the Gov-
ernor. Crossley was an English attorney
transported for a quaint bit of perjury. He
had sworn that a will was signed while the
testator had life in him; but “the life,” it
turned out, was a living fly inserted in the
dead man’s mouth by George Crossley. Lord
Ellenborough, who passed sentence of trans-
portation for life, said that the profession
was well rid of so acute a member.
THE TURKEY TROT.

culous claims as to the successes they have won over

A Melbourne drunk excused his condition
to a Richmond court the other morning.
“It’s all because of my sympathy for the
poor Belgians,” he said. “I made a solemn
promise that for every drink I took I’d give
a penny to Mrs. Smith’s relief fund, and,
gentlemen, I can’t be mean about it.”
The riotous conduct of memLers of the
Transvaal Scottish Regiment was investi-
gated by a Court at Jewhannesburg the other
day. The kilties implicated were Barney
Cohen, Abe Kupelusnick and Isaac Lipmann.,

like the Black Yatch.
In vain the rules are written,
Too late the frugal view,

Much more than she can chew.
KISSING THE LADY HELP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I do rot care for a chorus girl and bottles of foaming
fizz ;
I get my fun with the homely joys, for it’s there
the real fun is ;
No champagne suppers and cabs for me. I like to get
warmed with beer
And go home cheaply by tram or train with a smug,
contented leer —-
Straight home to the plain domestic joys that are to
be had for nix,
Away from expensive barmaids’ smiles that are dearer
than two-and-six.
I find life sweet if I am allowed, without a protest-
ing yelp,
To come home tight on Saturday night, and kiss the
lady-help.
Though wowser neighbors may frown and peer beyond
the backyard fence,
I think her giggles and shrieks are grand, arid every-
thing immense ;
We chase each other around the house, and trample
the cabbage-heds ;
We rush about at a furious pace like two professional
peds ;
And when she grabs me or I grab her, my word,
you should hear us shriek !
(Of course, it isn’t an every-night joke—it happens
but once a week ;
For I, as you know, am a moral man, and not an
immoral whelp
Who would basely seek, seven nights a week, to kiss
the ladv-help.)

Governor Liverpool, of Maoriland, will
take his 45th helping of happy returns of
the day this month. He has crowded a
good deal of business, etc., into his years.
After Eton he went to Sandhurst
and, from there, became a major in
the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort’s Own).
Then he was appointed gentleman-help
to Ihe Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and
later became Colonel in the Btli Bat-
talion London Regiment. When Bro.

prior to being exported to Maoriland in

has been a busy man.
C. 11. Nash, the eloquent Canon who was
the hero or victim of the famous row with
Archbishop Clarke, has decided to quit the
Anglicans and join the Congregationalists.
It is most likely that he will detect a call
from Prahran. Nash was one of the best
speakers the Church of England posssessed in
Vic., and for some time after the rumpus
with Clarke toiled as Archdeacon to the
Bishop of Sale.
Dr. 11. C. Barclay, of Waimate (M.L.),
was lately in England era route to France
as a Major in the R.A.M.C. He was holi-
daying in Japan in August when the fire
broke out. Joining the Russian Red Cross,
he was attached to the hospital of the Stli

after the surrender of the Austrians. In
the hospital there he had men from nearly

son of a parson, Dr. Barclay is already tired
of peace, and hopes to find a little excite-
ment in France. lie is about 50 and was

A cheerful old warrior saluted a Ballarat
Bench lately, after the British success at
Neuve Capelle—Michael Alexander Car-
michael, Crimean veteran, and allegedly
“one of the six hundred.” He is 88 years
old, six feet straight, and would shoulder a
rifle again if the army would take him.
Sydney Conservatorium of Music (which
owes its being to the fact that the State
Ministry, having taken Government House
from the Commonwealth, had to find
some use for the stables) is importing a
Belgian—Henry , Verbruggen—as director.
It is something of a coincidence that the
first big man imported by the city of Syd-
ney to tame its vast Town Hall organ was
a Belgian, too —Wiegaud. “Society” found
him a disappointment—partly because he
would keep ducks where his front garden
ought to be. Musically Sydney owed to him
“The Sausage Gavotte.” Dedicated to an
alderman-butcher who criticised his pro-
grammes, this masterpiece followed the dog
from its despairing yelp in the street to the
frying-pan.
Charles I. of England has been canonised.
This is the first Saint in the world’s history
who assumed the alias of Brown. He stayed
in Paris on his way to Madrid in IG2B as
“Mr. Brown”—a precedent which has been
followed by many another worthy Scot since
his day. He was also one of the most
persistent liars to get a place in the
Calendar of Saints. Furthermore, no
saint ever needed money quite so badly or
employed so many devices to get it. He knew
the pawnshops of his period like a modern
State Treasurer. lie becomes a Saint pro-
bably on the ground that he died a martyr
for the Anglican faith. Gladstone and
other great Churchmen held that had he
stooped to be a 17th century wowser he
would have saved his life at the expense of
Episcopalism. Low Churchmen have always
claimed, on the other hand, that, for at least
a dozen years, he was at heart a Papist.
Percy Bigwood is reported to have died
in Egypt. He made a stir in Australia
half a dozen years ago. Coming to Sydney
he fell in love with Carrie Moore, the
actress. It was whispered that he already
had a family; but it presently transpired
that at any rate he wasn’t married. Percy
and Carrie had a mucli-talked-of wedding.
Then, all his money being gone, he settled
down philosophically to live on her earn-
ings. This would not have mattered so
much if it hadn’t cost him so much to
live. There was a considerable-sized rift
in the matrimonial lute of recent years, and
few were sorry (barring possibly his. credi-
tors) when he heard the Empire calling.
“Sr”: Solly, M.L.A., Chairman of Vic-
toria’s Housing Commission, ought to know
the essentials of his inquiry. I remember
calling on him while he still hammered at
his bootmaker’s bench. He and his family
tenanted a three-roomed crib, with a front-
age of 16ft. A gutter made the side entrance.
The backyard was 19 x 14 feet. The rose
tree and the wood stack took up the bulk of
the “grounds.” The eldest boy had to hold
the dog out in the side lane whilst the wood
was chopped. One time he betrayed his
trust and the dog was cut up. The rent
Solly toiled to pay for all these inconveni-
ences was 10s. a week. There is one earnest
reformer on that Commission, anyway.
Melbourne City Council has a good work-
ing musician in its present specialist, Dr.
W. G. Price, who gets wonderful results
out of the Town Hall organ—a terrific and
somewhat ungainly instrument when the
city organist first took it on, but now fairly
broken to harness and capable of unex-
pected greatness. The present expert was
brought from Ireland to conquer and cor-
rect a perverse organ that had broken the
spirit of several operatives, and to make
the free public recitals pleasing in the ears
of the multitude. Ilesults have been emi-
nently satisfactory; the instrument that
was once stigmatised “tinpot” is now a
good deal more like a celestial choir, and
at the Doctor’s midday recitals (without
fee, if not without Price) big crowds of
attentive business men assimilate cheese
sandwiches and Bach with increasing satis-
faction. Price has, in fact, become one of
the biggest musical influences in Melbourne
to-day—an artist much heard, but little
heard of.
“Fingl'ass” takes a look backwards: —
I see in the papers that George H. Levers, a Mel-
bourne City Councillor, has been “60 years in the
colony.” When I arrived in 1866 the Levers family
were already well known at Carlton, which was not
the big place it is now. The patriarch of the elan
was built on a large scale, emitted a strong accent,
and was always found beneath a white belltopper. tie
tried to get into Parliament, but couldn’t. Son Wil-
liam, however, got there later, and also into the
City Council. He was a bit of an actor was William.
I saw him once at the old Princess’s. But lie died
young, and the old man took his seat in the Council
and sat on it for five and twenty years. Then George
having grown up followed, and is there yet.
A. W. STYLES, the new Chief Secretary
of S. Australia.
“J.B.’s” farewell: —
Gone from the Sunshine, James McMahon, dead at
Sydney on April 30. He was one of the best-known
of Australia's theatrical managers, one of the family
of brothers who enterprised in all branches of
the business in most parts of the world —from
Mrs. Scott Siddons in Europe and America
to Blondin in Australia; from John L. Sullivan to
Johnnie Sheridan,
lie was a friend of
Rajahs and stage-
hands ; knew the
peasant of Switzer-
land, the coolie of
Shanghai, Henare
in his pa in Maori-
land, the stage-
door keeper in
London, Paris, New
York anywhere.
He had many trea-
sures. But I think
he prized above all
others an author’s
copy of “Tom Saw-
yer,” given him by
his friend Mark
Twain. He was
widely-read, clear-
visioned in his
estimate of the
thousands of nota-
ble people he had
made acquaintance
with, and liberal
to a fault that was
one of his many
virtues. For the
last several years he
had attended to the
Sydney end of the
family’s theatrical
affairs, and his
hand was at the
lever until the
lung trouble closed
in sharply and
ended things.
J. D. FITZ-
GERALD, the
new representa-
tive of the Gov-
ernment in the
A.S.W. Leg.
Council.
This is told of a Great Voice. The Voice
arrived at a big hotel in a provincial town
where a concert was being held. At the
same hotel was a dyspeptic drummer with
no soul for music. Early on the first morn-
ing of its stay the Voice was up, exercising
its chords, and other occupants of the pre-
mises were getting for nix what .soulful
people had often paid great prices to hear.
Suddenly there came a thumping on the
door of the room within which the Voice
was exercising itself over the high jump, and
the coarse tones of the drummer echoed
through the hotel. “For God's sake, don’t
you start that, ma’am!” said the commer-
cial pagan. “We get enough of that from
the housemaids!”
Chief Justice Way, of South Aus., who
has been acting as Lieutenant-Gov. during
his Ex. Galway’s absence, has administered
the Government longer than any actual
Governor. Next year he will have been
Chief Justice for 40 years, and at inter-
vals he has kept the nest warm for
Musgrave, Cairns, Jervois, Robinson, Kin-
tore, Buxton, Tennyspn, Le Hunte.
Bosanquet and Galway. The various
periods total nearly seven years. On
one early occasion it fell to him to dis-
solve the Parliament in which he had him-
self sat —as Attorney-General, before going
on to the Bench. As he once said in a
speech, Oliver Cromwell is the only other
person in history known to have done it.
Sinclair Maclagan, who commanded the
Third Infantry Brigade, which bore the
brunt of the Australians’ first action in the
Dardanelles, was chief drill-instructor at
Duntroon Military College last year. A
Scot by birth, lie is the only professional
soldier with the Australian Expeditionary
Force in charge of a brigade. The two
other brigade commanders are by profession
lawyers—ll. N. MeLaurin, son of the late
Dr. McLaurin (N.S.W.) ; and J. W. McC’ay,
one-time Australia s .Minister for Defence
(1904-5).
‘Chasuble’’: More interesting to me than
any clergy tales are the fragmentary records
of the pioneer lay preachers on the goldfields.
Sanderson, of Geelong, gave the first sermon
at Ballarat, in the open air, on Sunday, Sep-
tember 29. INo 1. For a Ballarat “tea-meeting”
soon afterwards the butter cost Gs. a lb. :
milk, os. Gd. a quart: bread, ss. a 41b. loaf;
currants. 2s. (id. lb. The most famous miner
preachers were Jimmy Jeffrey and Tom
Pybus. Shirley Baker, afterwards lord of
Tonga, was at Castlemaine. Little Raston.
who had been wrecked first on the coast of
Ireland and then on that of Brazil, would
walk his IS miles on Sunday and preach
three times. Symons, at Forest Creek, put
up his own chapel of slabs, with bark and
canvas roof. But these two were “regulars.”
THE PEACEMAKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Finally, peace is assured and guaranteed by Ger-
niany’s power on sea and land, by the German
people in arms.
—The Kaiser, at Strasburg, on August 29, 1908.
“Peace is assured,” he said ;
“Our mild, large armies stand
As calm as cows when fed ;
The spikes upon their head
Will guard the sea and land.
(You Prussian blokes keep mum!
Don’t scare them with the drum —
“The Day” will surely come.)
“We do not mean to fight,
Our guns are but for show.
Wild war shall never blight
Our record pure and white—■
I, Wilhelm, tell you so.
(They’ll find oat soon enough.
This talk is Just the stuff.
Arm, while I work the bluff!)
“Lie down, good folk, and sleep,
I watch above your rest;
My ships are on the deep,
But though they cost a heap,
I bought them but for jest.
(Their sleep we will not rob;
They’ll rest, I bet a bob,
When we get on the job.)
“The eagle is a bird,
Domestic, kind and tame—
Your fears are most absurd.
You take a Kaiser’s word,
Peace is my solid aim.
(That makes it clear as mud—
All doubt nipped in the bud.
Keep mum and dream, of — blood!”)

That lifts the Insurance Fund of the Ordi-
nary department up to £32,649,58!); and on
top of that there are the Industrial Fund,
£582,167; and the Investment Fund,
£58,218 —a poor reserve to guarantee any
sort of securities running to over thirty
millions. What great obligations have been
accepted by the Society on behalf of the
holders of the 300,218 policies in the Ordi-
nary and the 121,055 in the Industrial
department may be judged by the fact that
the money which must be invested on their
behalf is almost 50 p.c. greater than the
aggregate of the paid capital of all the
banks in Australasia, and within a million
or two of their combined capital and
reserves.
It was the tremendous power in the
hands of men who had other peoples’ mil-
lions to play with which led to the insur-
ance ferment in the United States six or
eight years ago. But here is another in-
stance in which that dreadful beast Social-
ism does us a good turn. In the U.S.A.
railways and most other public utilities ate
owned by cos. whose bonds arc on the
market; and they provide most of the in-
vestments of big trusts like insurance cos.
In Australia Socialism gives the public
utilities over to the State, which issues its
own bonds, secured on the common revenues.
This enormously simplifies investment, and
makes it practically impossible for an Aus-
tralian insurance office to become the
danger that a' great one can be in the
U.S.A. The next table shows how the
A.M.P.’s huge funds are invested, with a
comparison to illustrate the way the tide
runs:—
1904. 1914.
Loans on mortgage.. .. 45.9 p.c. 37.4 p.c.
Public securities . . . . 24.9 ~ 39.6 ~
Premises . . . . .. 1.7 ~ 1.8 ~
Foreclosures .. .. .. 2.5 ~ 0.1 ~
Loans on policies . . . . 21.0 ~ 17.0 ~
Other assets .. .. 4.0 ~ 4.1 ~
In most respects that is a very fine table.
Essential No. 1 in a life office is the safe
investment of the funds. Of purchasable
investments public securities are the safest
of all; for the simple reason that two sticks
arc stronger than one. Loans on policies
are. also very safe. The Society, in fact,
doesn’t lend more than it owes; and you
can’t get further on velvet than that. But
it is bad to see these heavy loans on
policies, all the same. The worst insurance
is the mortgaged insurance—the policy
which you took out for your own or your
wife’s protection, and which you divert
from that purpose to protect somebody else.
Many a man who would be horrified if he
thought some moan skunk would come
round by and bye and rob liis widow’s purse
has little compunction about robbing his
own widow’s purse in advance. The in-
crease in the holding of public securities,
the remarkably small holding of foreclosed
properties, the small percentage of funds
sunk in office premises, etc., and the reduc-
tion of the loans-on-policies item are all
good features.
The A.M.P. has made such a specialty
of bonuses that the Australian insurer usu-
ally asks about them first thing. -Yet Ihe
size of a bonus tells him nothing. An in-
surance office is a shop which sells certain
goods. When you go down the street and
see in a snide tailor’s a card on a pair of
pants with “355.” marked out and “Reduced
to 355.” written on it, you know that the
tailor put on the extra 20s. merely to knock
it off again. An insurance office can do
the same thing: it can make bonuses look
tremendously impressive by the simple pro-
cess of charging stiff premiums. And it can
do that pretty safely, because the average
fool, while lie is always prepared to com-
pare bonuses, very rarely thinks of compar-
ing premiums. Even if lie did he would
have to watch for a few things that might
quite upset his calculations. One office, for
instance, takes a man at “next birthday”:
another quotes at “nearest birthday.” Tak-
ing at 39} years of age an endowment
policy payable at 50, the difference between
“nearest birthday” and “next birthday”
would mean close-up £1 p.c. a year in the
premium. In short, bonuses are not every-
thing. and neither are premiums. What
you want to know, after being satisfied of
security, is the not cost of the insurance.
The net cost is determined by the expense
rate, the interest earnings and the mortality
experience. These next figures show what
the A.M.P.’s exes, were p.c. of total in-
come :—■
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1903 ..£8 17 0 p.e. | 1909 ..£8 12 11 p.c.

1908 . . 819 6 ~ | 1911 .. 815 5 „
That is a very excellent showing. But the
figure for lhe past year wouldn’t be as good
as that if the eo. had got as much new busi-
ness as it had written in recent years.
Assuming that the old or renewal business
cost 7 p.c. and single-premium business 8
p.c., then :—•

1914 .. 2,421,995 219,570 367,601 89.6 ~
Still, considering drought and war. the
figures, whichever way you look at them,
are astonishingly good. And for the past
year they are all the better because the exes,
include a bonus of £9283 to officers and
agents. As to the second big factor in
producing bonuses :
Interest Realised on Aveiiaue Funds.
1903 ..£4 810 p.c. | 1909 ..£4 9 8 p.c.

1907 . . 4 911 „ 1913 .. 411 8 „
1908 .. 4 9 4 ~ | 1914 .. 412 10 „
That is good. And it will be better yet.
The improvement shown during the last
four or five years is in part a set-off against
the. recent higher level of prices in general
which produced a higher expense rate. And
the most recent jump in earnings will more
or less counterbalance the untimely claims
that will come in on account of the war.
Bluntly, the war will probably quite pay
for itself so far as the A.M.P. is concerned.
As expense rates and interest earnings
have improved, bonuses, always good, have
got better: —
1888-1893 (boom 3'ears) .. 40.3 p.c. of premiums
1893-1898 34.1*
1898-1903 .. .. .. 34,8

1910 38.4
1911 38.5 „
1912 38.5 „
1913 .. 39.1 ~
1914 39.6
Lor the past year they won’t work out quite
so well. The cash bonus divided in 1914
was £1,084,840. For the past year
£1,020.189 is divisible; and no doubt there
will be more policies to divide the amount
amongst. But not much if any of the pro-
bable small reduction in bonus rate is due
to poorer aggregate results. The office has
been gradually reducing the assumed interest
earnings. If you undertook 10 years ago to
pay a man £5OO in 20 years, plainly you
must have more in hand now if you assume
that the money is only going to earn 8 p.c.
than if you assumed it was going to earn
4.p.c. The compound interest on £lOOO at
•* P-c- would be £843 in 10 years; at 4 p.c.
it _ would be £4BO. When, therefore, an
office assumes a lower rate of interest than
it has assumed hitherto, it must have more
in hand in order to produce the same result
in a given number of years ; and the extra
funds can only be got in hand by hanging
on to some of the surplus which would
otherwise be divisible as bonus. This year
another lot of policies, hitherto on a 84 p.c.
basis, have been put on the 3 p.c. mark;
and that meant collaring £142,131 of the
surplus to make the necessary increase of
reserves-—the shop name for the funds which
have been accumulated towards paying the
policy when it becomes due. While the
immediate effect of this is to reduce the
bonus, the ultimate effect is to increase it
gradually, because of the wider margin
between, the assumed rate and the actual
earnings. That is. of course, if the actual
interest earnings are maintained.

But there is such a great difference between
the £B2 ISs. p.c. of the Industrial and the
£8 15s. of the Ordinary that nobody who
has an Industrial policy and can see his
way clear to transfer to the Ordinary should
hesitate a day. Of every £1 the Ordinary
policy-holder pays in, 2s. 9d. goes now in
exes. Of every £1 the Industrial policy-
holder pays in. 6s. (id. goes that way. It is
remarkably little for an Industrial depart-
ment ; yet the prudent Industrial policy-
holder will see the advantage of going over
to the other branch and getting in extra
insurance the 3s. 9d. in the £ which he now
wastes in agents’ shoe-leather.

A and E. Ellis, Ltd., was constituted in
3!>07. and on a capital of £25,000 the co.
worked the Nambucca and Bellinger mills,
ran a timber yard at I'yrmont, and was
interested in yards at Homebush and Manly.
In 1912 the co., which up to then consisted
mostly of the two Ellises, who were the sole
directors, decided to launch out, and to pro-
vide the means the capital was increased to
£75,000. The whole of the extra £50,000
has since been subscribed and paid, evi-
dently at par. A storage depot, with saw-
mill, joinery works, etc., was built on land
acquired at Ehr's Point, Sydney, and con-
nected up with rail; the Bawley Point mill
co. and other interests were bought out, and
the mosquito fleet was added to. A good
deal of attention was given to the retail
trade; and between that and contracts
entered into with the N.S.W. Works Depart-
ment and the Commonwealth for hardwood
and Oregon, the co. has thus far been able
to give a highly satisfactory account of itself.
The past half-year naturally doesn’t show
up as well as its predecessors, taking into
account the larger capital now employed;
nevertheless the directors say: “A large
number of contracts are still in hand, while
the State and Commonwealth Government
departments continue to order largely.” The
dividend for the past year was 73 p.c.
rnfortunately i| is not possible for Ibis
paper to take so cheerful a view of the
future. The borrowing boom out of which
this co., like other timber-suppliers, has been
making such solid profits, cannot last much
longer: it is, in fact, only continued now
partly by the grace of the hard-pressed
British Government (which intimates that
the assistance cannot be continuous), and
partly by the N.S.W. Government embracing
a foreign contractor who promises to help
raise the wind. The next swing of the pen-
dulum must be to the Slump side of the
clock, so far as buildings and works con-
struction are concerned. That will not
only mean less orders, but also lower prices
owing to fierce # v* competition; and it is a
question whether the much-increased costs,
especially for timber-getting and on the
timber boats, will instantly adjust them-
selves to the changed conditions. One thing
in the co.’s favor, in view of the slacker
times ahead, is the comparatively small lia-
bilities ; on all accounts they amount to
£21.729, and against that there is over
£30.000 in stocks and book-debts—much of
the latter (£13,827) no doubt due by Gov-
ernments. The directors’ claim that depre-
ciation has been amply provided for through-
out; but the amounts written off profit on
that account are not ascertainable. Apart
from that the accounts and directors’ state-
ments are almost model documents.

The Victorian farmer’s luck has been clean
out. In a year when he might have made
a nice bit —albeit out of other people’s mis-
fortunes —his crops were a blank, not to
say blanky, failure. Not only has he
nothing to sell, hut he must buy seed wheat,
and in most cases horse-feed, at fabulous
prices, to see his working stock through
this sowing. And that doesn’t end liis
troubles; for owing to the dry summer he
has been able to do no fallowing to speak
of, so that he won’t get the full benefit out
of the extra-good prices that promise next
year; while a good deal of the seed that
lias been sown is ’‘malting” and rotting
owing to the wretched rains that have come
so far this autumn. The National is to a
great extent a country bank; and because
the country has done badly in Victoria and
South Aus. the National has not done as
well as usual. Certainly the interest on
the mortgage runs on whether the crop
fails or not; but exchanges and other earn-
ings have been lost. Besides, deposits are
dearer, and though rates for some accom-
modation have been put up. others can’t be.
Taxes have also taken out a bigger bite;
and the bite is going to be bigger" still. In
the circumstances it is more to the credit of
the bank to show a shrinkage of profit than
it would be to show an increase.
The available funds to work with have
been a bit less too: —

One of course doesn’t like to see decreases
all down the column like that; but. let
there be no doubt about it. this isn’t the
bank's fault —it is Australia’s. This coun-
try has borrowed so riotously and at the
same time it imports so prodigally that even
in average seasons it has all its work cut out
to export enough produce to pay the bill for
the interest and tin 1 imported goods. When
the seasons are poor, if the balance is not
maintained by lessening imports, the foreign
bill can be met in only two ways—by flying
more kites abroad (which means getting
deeper in the mess) or exporting gold.
The worst sufferer must be the local bor-
rower. The shareholder and the depositor
are all right—for the present, anyway. In
1912 internal reserves were disclosed and
transferred to the formal Reserve Fund, and
that indicated that there wasn’t an asset
which even looked to the management as
though it needed writing down. It can be
assumed that, at that date, all the assets
were worth 20s. in the £. and that there was
a bit over for contingencies. No doubt
there has been some shrinkage since then :
but not enough to make much of a hole in
the £572,895 of visible reserves which safe-
guard the shareholders’ capital. Their prin-
cipal doesn’t therefore call for worry. As
for the interest return, the present 7 p.c.
dividend requires £52.437, and even with
the diminished profit shown there is £24,787
over for the half-year. That is a comfort-
able margin. As for depositors, they can
figure it out that the bank has cash and
liquid assets representing just over 40 p.c.
of all its liabilities, and £9,300.000 of other
assets to pay the other £7,210.000 of debt:
and having let those calculations soak in.
creditors can turn over and go to sleep.

The reserves disclosed last year are grateful
and comforting now. Possibly if general-
manager Wilson had been in Wicked Willie’s
confidence he would have kept them up his
sleeve; but having no such privilege he
shook them down, which was an intimation
that, after looking at his hand, he was satis-
fied he couid win without them. It meant as
plainly as a management could say it that all
the securities had been overhauled, and there
weren’t any which looked like making a bad
debt for the bank. That was a splendid
start for a war. At the best of times a
war causes enough depreciation of securi-
ties for a bank to provide for without hav-
ing any anterior troubles. True, if things
go on as they are going now, we in Australia
will not suffer any stunning bump. If we
had had a good season we should have been
very flourishing indeed, in spite of the
dislocation of the wool and metal markets.
But the bill will come in by and bye ; and
when it does it is going to keep our noses to
the grindstone. To what extent the banks
will suffer isn’t yet certain. A lot will depend
upon the kind of taxes imposed. It is quite
possible that banks may still flourish. The
nation will have to struggle for a big turn-
over ; and it is from a customer's turnover
rather than from what he has left when he
has paid his taxes and other debts, that a
bank’s earnings are derived.
This bank isn’t so much a rural institu-
tion as most of them, which explains some
of these figures

The Royal owes £2,550,708, and it holds a
substantial 41 p.c. of it liquid—more than
enough to meet any sudden demand that is
at all likely. Against the £1.173,251 of
debt which isn’t represented by liquid assets
it has £1,722,912 of non-liquid assets; and
that is a splendid margin, especially in view

Twelve months ago The Bulletin invited
investors to ask themselves why they were
then giving £65 for the £lO shares in this
co. The commonest answer would have been
that it had paid people in the past to do it.
No doubt. For instance, if a man in 1904
had given £6O for liis shares, and had hung
on to all the bonus shares that had come
afterwards, the 124 p.c. div. alone would
last year have been worth to him 54 p.c. on
his investment, and he would have the value
of the year's bonus shares to the good. But
it was only on the assumption that bonuses
would continue that any such quotation as
£65 was justified. It was then figured 'out
here that there would have to be a bonus of
one share in 10 every year for the next nine
years to procure the investor at £65 a return
of 4 p.c.. assuming the 124 p.c. div. to con-
tinue. It was added that any such distribu-
tion was most unlikely, as there were limits
to the earning capacity of a newspaper, and
competition that was looming ahead wouldn’t

do either the D.T. or the 5.M.11. any good.
The competition hasn t arrived , but it -
only choked off for a while by a war which is
no good to the co. either. After one war is
finished another will start so far as the 1 .1-
is concerned. .
Meantime, though in the first seven
months of last year business boomed in byci-
ii(>v, the co. shows a protit so much shrunken
that there wasn’t enough to safely provide
for any bonus at all for 1914. Moreover, it
isn’t any use issuing bonus shares it you
can’t pay the dividend on them; and it
looks at present as if the co. can’t yet pay
dividend on a very much bigger capital than
it has already. If the capital were 50 per
cent, bigger than it is now, last year’s profit
wouldn’t have been sufficient to pay the usual
IL>! p. c . Take the biggest profit made dur-
ing the recent boom period—£s6,B92. It
would eat up all of it to pay a 12-1 p.c. div.
on £455,000. The present capital is
£266,031. If things kept as good as they
were when they were at their best a while
ago, the co. could thus pay 124 p.c. on halt
as much again as its present capital; but
it isn’t safe to assume that things will get
back to their best for a long while to come,
and when they get back there will be three
morning papers to share whatever’s going for
breakfast. At the present price of some-
where around £3O the investor gets 4 p.c.
and a fraction that doesn’t matter; for the
other 2 p.c. which he ought to be getting
lie must bank the hope that some day he
will receive another little lot of bonus shares.
They will come, most likely. If three years
hence he gets one in 10, and can then still
get £3O a pliare, the bonus will, be equal
to 34 p.c. p.a. Four years hence it will be
worth 24 p.c. Five years, 2 p.c. In other
words, if he is prepared to back the co. to
pay 124 p.c. divs., and give him a bonus of
one share in 10 within the next five years,
he can get a return of 6 p.c. by buying at
£30 —provided, of course, he can then sell
his bonus share for £3O. But if he has lo
wait more than five years, the investment
return is under 6 p.c.
During the past year the co. has been
building new offices, and at Dec. 31 had
£72.000 sunk in the land and uncompleted
premises. That means idle money. Prob-
ably the co.’s income was reduced by £3OOO
on this account. The capital and reserves
—together £369,508, exclusive of fund to
amortise leaseholds —are practically all re-
presented by this property a- d by deposits,
stock and plant (written down severely).
That means about £l4 per share for which
there is solid security. The. balance of the
purchase money must be debited to Faith.

Circular issued last week by the Insur-

Negotiations are in progress between the directors
and a large, influential investment co. having in-
terests in all States of the Commonwealth desirous of
an interest in the capital of this co. Although no
contract has vet been entered into 1 have every belief
that proposals will come before shareholders at an
early date for their approval.
The co. with which the 1.0. A. is negotiat-
ing is understood to be Howard Smith's. It
proposes to take up the unissued shares and
give the 1.0. A. the insurance business, of the
cos. which it controls. These cos. include
Australian Steamships, Ltd., whose connec-
tion alone is very important.

The co. is beginning to feel the benefit of a
wave of energy which came over it recently
and caused it to erect new and improved
plant. The result is that sales for the
year amounted to £10,863, as compared with
£9789 for 1913-14. And sales of £lO,OOO
on a paid capital of £25,316, with no bor-
rowed money in plant, speaks well for
someone or other. Ample allowance is usu-
ally made for depreciation, and for 1913-14,
besides the usual £lOOO, a further £BOO was
taken from the Contingency Fund, and used
to write down plant. For the past year
another £lOOO goes in the same direction,
and profits are shown in the table minus
that amount. If the current wear and tear
actually calls for this drastic writing-oil of
profits, then obviously the 10 p.c. div. isn t
being earned and should not be paid. l>ut
there seems at least a sizeable doubt whether
the plant is losing value as rapidly as all
that. .
* * *
The new co. to take over and run the
Broken Hill Prop.’s smelting works at Port
Birie (S.A.) is to have a capital ot
£750,000, of which £600.000 is to be issued
at once, and the other little bit held in
reserve in case other cos. should want to
come in. Fach of the three co-operating
cos.—the P>. 11. Prop., B. 11. South and
P>. 11. North —is to take £200,000 of the
capital. The B. 11. Prop, takes its whack
of shares in part payment. onotiun
£250,000 it gets in money. Ihe iT.D.t)
thus provided pays for the works. , f
etc., will be paid for in cash at an agreed
valuation. The new co. is to have tne
right to take the whole of the output of th
three cos. for 50 years, which is looking wel
ahead. If the works can t handle all that
is offered they will take from each a quan-
tity proportioned to its output. An exc l
tion is made with regard to zinc conce -
trates. The spelter plant at 1 °rt 111
is capable of producing only about I<»U tom
of metal a week —a mere flea bite compai e
with the total quantity in the concentrates
which the three cos. could furnish and th
Broken Hill Prop, will have the right to
supply the lot —for some years, at any rate.
But that really doesn’t matter to the other
two cos., because they have contracts with
zinc-treatment cos. —the Zinc Corporation
and De Bavay’s—under which the latter
take all their zinc output.
The new co. is not going to declare big
dividends. It will work on the same prin-
ciple as the little butter factories, lixing a
price for supplies which will yield an assured
5 or 0 p.c. on capital plus contribution to a
renewal fund, and anything that is over will
be passed back in the shape of a bonus to
suppliers.
The two cos. which will have to raise
£200,000 apiece do not propose to issue new
shares. The money will come from an issue
of 0 p.c. debentures. Each co. will
take power to issue £250,000. This will
give a reserve of £50,000. The directors
will be Bowes Kelly and Duncan Mcbryde.
of the B. 11. Prop.; F. C. Howard, long the
managing director of the B. 11. South ; and
W. E. Baillieu and W. S. Robinson, who
are interested in both the North and the
South.
The debentures to be sold by the B. 11.
South and B. 11. North will have a currency
of 15 years, will carry (> p.c. interest, and
will be issued at 07. There has been a large
demand for underwriting —larger, in fact,
than the people who have the business in
hand can supply.
The B. IT. Prop, has no doubt done good
business in getting rid of the works. It is
not able to fully supply them from its own
mine now ; and in a very lew years it would
be still more at the mercy of outside sup-
pliers—chiefly the South and North. Hence
it was suggested in Melbourne that the
latter two concerns ought to hold oft for a
while and then squeeze. That might have
been “smart”; and again it might have
been too “smart.” General-manager Del-
prat probably wasn't a philanthropist when
early in the war he advised his co. to accept
concentrates from the other two big mines
—nowadays bigger mines, in fact, than the
P, II Prop.—and treat them on joint
account. But even if he had this co-opera-
tive undertaking then in his mind, his co.
would certainly be justified, if the other
cos. hadn’t now come in. to turn them down
and thus probably block their market for
the rest of the war. For while they can
get a market for a very fair quantity of
Fead and a practically unlimited quantity
of silver, they would have the utmost diffi-
culty in getting any market at all for silver-
load concentrates. That of course is their
own fault, seeing that thev have been un-
patriotic enough through all Ihese years to
steadily build up what amounts to a Ger-
man monopoly in silver-lead as well as zinc
smelting.
Syd Smith, once Minister of Mines in
N. S. Wales, is local director of the
Mouramba —the old Nynmgee copper show,
referred to last week as tipped to make an
early start. Last week lie got a cable
from London authorising him to go ahead;
and the manager, C. 11. Hansen, has been
in Sydney making necessary arrangements.
The old Mount Hope, too, though not so
close up to resumption, is now in the hands
of people who have strong hopes. Aiidley
Smith gave it a thorough overhaul a little
while ago, and found it a 5 p.c., proposition
outside the pay limit with copper at an
average price and so much haulage to do,
but the starting of the railway from Con-
dobolin towards Broken Hill has com-
pletely changed the outlook.
* * *
Carpathia directors have been up having
their annual look at the mine and the mill
at Barmedman. Consulting-engineer New-
man’s soul has been troubled by the £.->OOO
or so of recoverable tin in the tailings
dumps, and a thousand or thereabouts will
go in plant extensions to get it out. No
changes of any consequence were autho-
rised” so far as the mine is concerned:
tl ings are going along nicely there.
* -* * *
Magnus has retired from the job of
general manager of Mount Morgan, which
he had made a very prickly one, and A. A.
Boyd is acting. Magnus was hopeless, not
of course because lie didn’t know enough
about metallurgy, but simply because he
could rarely see merit or virtue in Aus-
tralians. He came to Australia from the
U.S.A. to manage the refinery at Port
Kembla (N.S.W.), and it wasn’t long be-
fore the union officials used numbers to
denote their strikes. He went on to Morgan
when the treatment troubles were supposed
to have got Captain Richard down and
beaten him. Unfortunately he antagonised
those who might have made things possible
for him ; and when, in view of the conclu-
sion of his agreement in August, he sug-
gested that £OOOO a year and the usual
perks.—house, lighting, etc. —was a fair
thing, the directors and he differed. At his
own request they released him at the end
of April. Boyd, who is appointed acting
g.m., went north as mining manager, and
lately has been “superintendent.” He was
a colliery manager when over 20 years ago
the Broken Hill Prop, decided that that was
the training which ought to be of most value
in handling the very wide Broken Hill lode.
He did excellent work there, and later on
as manager of the Wallsend. In the biggest
law action fought between Broken Hill cos.
—B. 11. Junction v. Junction North—he
was one of the two experts on the Junction
side: and his performance in the box added
to his reputation.
* * * *
Nothing definite has yet been received, in
Brisbane regarding the Lakekamu dredging-
proposition, in which Capt. Richard, late of
Mount Morgan, and his friends are inter-
ested, and which T. W. Horton and J. O.
Armstrong went to Papua to test; but there
is understood to be something radically
wrong with it.
}!j * * *
Little St. Mungo Copper, Cloneurry, has
got to work again and is on another patch
of its beautiful stuff. For April it pro-
duced 200 tons, worth £2OOO. There was a
profit of (say) £llOO in that little lot.
* * * *
.T. Uriel, manager of Al, Gaffney’s (Vic.),
sickened the Melbourne bears the other day
by reporting a clean-up of ISOOoz. from 600
tons, “including accumulated specimens.”
The co. out of the ISOOoz. pays a dividend
and bonus of 3s. per share. As the Board is
turning 14090 z. reserve gold into Australian
notes or a bank credit, a dividend equalisa-
tion reserve of over £6OOO also springs up
ready for future service. The doubtful point
in ail this is, not that Uriel should have had
on April 10 an amalgam reserve to yield
14090 z., but that the Board on April 2N
should only “understand” that that nest-egg
was derived from a reserve held back from
month to month for equalisation purposes.
The floors in the mountain dykes are paste
at one time and jewels at another, so Al
could get a patch in hand very quickly and
lose it as rapidly. But the bobbery kicked
up some time back over mines holding
“banks” of any kind made the market very
sniffy over this fresh outbreak of the custom.
What is wanted is that the Board should say
why. if Uriel reported the lodging of UOOoz.
on April 10, it didn’t post the fact in the
vestibule beside the other yields.
E. J. Hartley, of the Duke and Main
Leads, Maryborough (Vic.), is troubled
over the claim of Victorian miners for a big-
increase in wages. He threatens that il
they get it his mine will shut down. If ii
does the miners had better snap up the claim,
for, although only half worked out. it has
added £339,000 to the gold yield of the State
and paid £62,000 in dividends. The co. last
six months averaged nearly lodwt. per
fathom —21dwt. more than in the previous
term. After following a narrow vein of gold
in the gutter for 2000 ft., the co. seems to
find the shoot not only widening but increas-
ing in value. This is at the northern end
of the claim. So even if the western end is
poor there should be a nice bit of profit to
collect out of the northern block, and it
won’t be the new wages that will stop the
plant.
¥r * * *
Victoria United has seen £6OO 000 of gold
tickled out of the Ballarat East reefs and
indicators. It strayed at times near the call
line, but generally managed to break into a
bit of profitable stuff before the banker got
too pressing. Last half-year saw the aver-
age grade of quartz below 4dwt. Prospect-
ing at 1200 ft. and 1300 ft. disclosed only ro..d
metal, and at last calls had to come. These
shook up the bull crowd, and Victoria United
for a while looked like crumpling up. Since
then cash has rolled into the office till another
try is to be made, this time in formations at
1600 ft. This work will be deep mining for
Ballarat East. If a bit of luck should come
to the old claim, other mines on the line may
pluck up courage to resume.
* « * * *
South Australia’s new Minister for
Mines Blundell, zealous for knowledge of
his department, projects a visit to the
South-East to look into the prospects of pet-
roleum. It will be a look-in with a layman’s
eve; but better an honest layman than a
crafty bishop. It will be next to useless,
though, if the layman be accompanied by any
official negative and prompted to believe
without evidence in the gloomy pessimist
Wade. Meantime J. T. Whaley, of the
Ocean Oil. Ltd., states publicly that, so far,
the log of his Kingston well is in fiat contra-
diction of Dr. Wade’s publication.
“U.1.A.V.” : Lots of reasons are given for
the decay of mining, and one more won’t tip
the load over. Guinea-pig directors are a
curse in Victoria. Each legal manager’s
office has its tame director, trained to
fetch and carry, sign cheques and cancel
scrip, use the seal or the rubber stamp
deftly, pass accounts or “see” the bank
manager. Sometimes the g.p. visits the mine
to save the chairman or the legal manager
the trouble, and then he draws travelling-
expenses on the higher scale. The guinea-
pig director rarely knows anything about
mining, so he sits mute at meetings—except
when the chairman asks: “Is it your pleas-
ure, gentlemen, that these minutes be con-
firmed?” and then lie roars as loudly as a
sucking pig, “Aye.” When proxies have to
be collected to cover up something shady, the
g.p. is sent out on secret service to inter-
view shareholders. For doing this effec-
tively he secures his seat on the Board and
his right to grab at the silver which is
placed in a kitty on the table at each meet-
ing. Woe betide Mr. (I. I’ig if he lie five
minutes late at the meeting. His share is
already safely planted in the waistcoats of
his colleagues. But he never is late. It
wouldn’t be playing the guinea pigs’ game
if he were.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, May 3, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Neither Governor Stanley—a sporting
individual —nor the vice-regal Galway took
any evening duds with them on their recent
tour with Host Strickland. They were out
for ease and information, and speeches were,
like swallow-tails, cut out of the menu.
Soft shirts and sac suits and general hilarity
—in spite of their “Follow the King” soft
drinks—trimmed the holiday. At Canberra
iliey found just sufficient water to quench
their thirst. But Albury, in the throes of a
rainless season, was panic-stricken when
three Governors and their retinue rushed the
drinking fountains that, in the long ago,
dribbled Archdeacon Boyce’s favorite liquor.
An unreliable rumor says that the Cocked
Hat thirst has drained the Murray to its
last pint.
When the touring Governors got to Can-
berra they expected to say “How do?” to
G.-G. Ferguson. But the Scotch bird had
flown to some adjacent rookery, and Mrs.
Miller, wife of the local administrator, had
only three cups of tea to pour out.
Aide Mulholland, who shadows the steps
of Governor Galway, in South Aus., is a
genial young Irishman and a younger son of
Baron Dunleath, who shoots over 15,000
acres in County Down. The Gentleman
Help, who answers to the name of Jack,
had a chilly time about the feet during his
recent N. S. Wales scamper with their Exes.
As he was much too long for most up-country
beds, he was usually discovered by a pal in
the morning hanging his toes out in a hard
frost over the bottom rail.
The Navy, or what is left of it here, is more
or less indignant at having its presence for-
gotten by the purveyors of official feasts.
Captain Henderson, It.N., in charge of Gar-
den Island, is so shy in social matters that
I fancy he had to burst through the crowd to
get near the saluting base at the big khaki
display 10 days ago. Commander Robins,
R.N., now in charge of the Tingira, had to
ask for a permit to be present. At the
Mayoral spread to inter-State Governors,
never a naval tar quenched his thirst in the
Town Hall. No doubt the apparent slight
is quite inadvertent, and due to the popular
belief that anyone who wears R.N. as a tail
to his name is somewhere else on active ser-
vice.
Perhaps secretary Boose, of the Royal
Colonial Institute, was nearly killed with the
hospitality that Australians poured into him
during his recent visit:. Anyhow, he has to
recuperate, and Sir Harry Wilson is in his
chair. Sir Harry is the handy man who
has done all kinds of odd jobs for John Bull
—-from Colonial Secretary in the Orange
River Colony to smoothing out the wrinkles
in the matter of Mixed Marriages in Malta
many years ago.
Norman C. Lockhart, the debonair
Crown Law officer who had a jaunt to Eng-
land as adviser to counsel in the Privy
Council appeal re Government House, has
not returned to his base. Landing soon
after the outbreak of Germanic murder,
Lockhart, having helped to win the case,
volunteered his aid in outing the sausage-
king. When last heard of he was busy
somewhere in France.
Christchurch, Maoriland’s pancake city,
was a long time showing its gratitude to "a
little woman who has done a lot of humani-
tarian work for it. But a Harvest Festival
the other day in aid of the Belgians gave
an opportunity which it seized. x\ Queen
of the Festival contest was organised ; and
Nurse Maude, who has given the biggest
part of her life to nursing the poor, and
was the first to do something practical to
combat consumption in Maoriland, was
made a winner with 291,440 votes ('they
cost 2d. each), and a majority over the
next best of 22,949. The ' total poll was
1.083,1n.->. and the financial scoop for Bel-
-520. When the crowd of about
40,000 heard the result it proceeded to show
joy in 40.000 different ways, and the
little nurse discovered what her neighbors
thought of her.
Delfosse Badgery. the Australian airman
who has been flying over Sydnev and sub-
urbia during the past few months, has
tucked his feet under his machine, and
buzzed rather dejectedly from the hangar
at Concord to his home at Moss Yale
Badsrer.v hoped for a flying match with Hart
or Marduel; in fact, a race from Penrith to
Sydney was wrangled over for a while. But
nothing came of the challenges. Still that
didn’t hurt so much as the refusal of the
Defence Department to take him with the
Australian troops as their angel.
Brian Osborne, reported killed in the
earlier stages of the Ypres carnage, was a
grandson of the late Henry Osborne, of
Marshall Mount, Illawarra. The numerous
clan that has so many flocks and herds in
this State has given several sons to the
Front. Brian was in the 15th Hussars.
The frankly-hideous building into which
the old Government House stables have been
transformed is to be christened “Gonserva-
torium of Music” this week. Governor
Strickland names the new baby on May 6.
The authorities w T ho snatched the shabby-pic-
turesque mews ought to have seen that a pile
worthy of this magnificent site and ' this
esthetic purpose was added to the decorative
vista of the Botanic Gardens. Instead, the
whole effect is paltry. A suburban-villa slate
roof, with a small pepper-pot turret, sur-
mounts walls where writhing black lines
(presumably electric sparks bottled up) lie
under the three inches or so of eaves. The
Gothic survival —the old castellated outer
wall—with a fresh smear of paint, is a comic
relief to the Merely Mary Ann appearance of
the new interior. In this Chalet de Car-
michael Amy Castles is to sing at the font
for the first time since the war sent her
this way.
The Bush Book Club gurgled with enthusi-
asm the other afternoon under the sub-regal
roof. Lady Edeline held the fort at the far
end of the room, and the company, with the
westering sun in its eyes, tried to give a
name to the speakers. Mrs. David made the
most clear-cut remarks, and heartily
thumped any person present or absent who
regarded the Club as a luxury to be foregone
during the war. The strenuous lion, treas-
urer, Mrs. Margaret Rutter, briefly recorded
the trifling expense that enables the club to
transport reading matter to Bullocky Bill,
c/o the Sunset. Miss Dorothea Mackellar
goaded the committee to fresh efforts by allud-
ing to almanacs and elderly time-tables as
the chief mental sustenance of Outback
humpies. Mrs. Aubrey Withers, in black
and white stripes and a magpie toque, added
her testimony.
Help d’Apice guided the company to its
seats, and official secretary Budge (a pressed
man, torn from reams of blue paper) navi-
gated our Best People to the refreshment
buffet. Mrs. Harry Finn, Miss Birch and
the gentle Strickland girls assisted to feed
the always-hungry herd. Miss Margaret
Windeyer distributed leaflets to convert
doubters. The tall Miss Trouton, in purple
and fine muslin, who packs up small libraries
for the Bush, and does it just for love, rested
from her labors to applaud the platform per-
formances of the party.
The appointment of a Belgian-born natur-
alised British subject as Conservatorium
Director ought to fit the times. And since
he has been picked by such noted musicians
as Elgar, Landon Ronald, Sir Hubert Parry
and Sir Alex. McKenzie, Henry Verbruggen
ought also to know his business. He has
spent the last 20 years on British soil, and
plays the fiddle for choice.
What happened somewhere else won’t,
therefore, be at all likely to happen
at the Sydney Conservatorium. The
Professor in that case was a very
bald German with very bald opinions
about the vast superiority of the Prussian
over the miserably flaccid Pritish. . The
students stood it as long as.they could : then,
the sneers and gibes getting past enduring,
they caught the eagle in his cage and painted
the Union Jack upon his billiard-ball
pate. He put up with it as though he knew
he deserved it. Then a youngster took
up the Professor’s fiddle and started to
scrape “Rule Britannia” from it. “Ach,
nein, nein, nein!” he cried then. “Any-
thing you like to me, but do not touch
my feedle.” Of course the Head Serang was
a volcano of indignation. As soon as the
story reached his ears he rang up the Pro-
fessor with apologies. “I do not know vot
you say,” said the Professor. The Head
Serang went into details and more apologies.
The only reply he got was : “Ye will say it
never happened.” And. officially, it never
did.
The Belgian Consul —a steadv slogger at
these affairs —will open a garden festival in
the grounds of Heidelburg, Wollstonecraft,
on May 15. for his bruised compatriots. The
name recalls another “war” item of the
week: the employees of the Frankfurt
Sausage Co. met to cheer one of their num-
ber who was going to the Front and to drop
something worth having into his pocket.
Dr. Phipps, of Mosman, and his smart
little missus have left the leafy suburb, after
farewell handshakes from innumerable
friends. A conversazione in the local Town
Barn was the excuse for a crowded rally. He
goes to the Big Fight, with the rank of major
in the A.M.O. ; while she stays with a sister
in England.
Philip Linton, son of the very gentle shep-
herd who_ was the first Bishop of Riverina,
recently joined the great majority. He is
at Singapore nowadays, and there a few
weeks ago led Muriel Wright to the altar
rails. The girl hails from Ceylon.
Kathleen Garvan, the darlc-eyed eldest
daughter of the late J. P. Garvan, was
quietly wed to Fulke Ivnatchbull Prideaux-
Brune, of Cornwall, the other day. The
big poloist, J. J. Garvan, handed his sister
over to her young man under the maternal
roof. The moon is passing in Victoria.
The Art students are going to repeat their
gorgeous tableaux, “The Awakening of Aus-
tralia,” in the Repertory Theatre on Alay
15. This time it is to help the Soldiers’
Club. By way of an improvement, the
notion of having Australia, in the person
of a plump damsel, squirming outside the
drop-curtain might be reconsidered. She
was certainly out of the way of the scene-
shifter’s boots, but otherwise was an awk-
ward figure, having no special connection
with the scenes behind. “The Dying
Gladiator” has kindly arranged to fix his
limbs this time behind a non-transparent
curtain.
George Vivers, the Kings Plains
squatter, and his lovely Mrs. George, are
domiciled in town for the winter. They
have been here and there all the summer,
with surfing at Manly and Bondi as part
of their efforts to slay time.
Mrs. J. Gilruth, wife of the N.T. Admin-
istrator, left with a young daughter for
Darwin, in the Montoro. The times are
out of joint for much social junketting, but
the departing visitors drank a few cups of
more or less ceremonial tea in Sydney.
Gwendoline Nicklin, a Watson’s Bay
damsel, passed under the usual avenue of
steel after saying “I will” to a Tasmanian,
Lieut. G. P. Meredith, who later on sets out
for the scrimmage. The red carpet was laid
at St. James’s Church, and four brides-
maidens pattered up and down it in pursuit
of the bridal train. Pretty Poppy Braby,
another Watson’s Bay girl, was included in
this bunch of buds, who were decked out in
deep buttercup frocks, with very saucy black
hats perched sideways on the head.
Mrs. B. It. Wise has booked her passage to
London by the Mooltan, sailing on May 15.
This looks as if one family, at any rate,
thinks it knows who the next Agent-General
for N.S.W. is to be. Son Tony has arrived
from • Calcutta, where he has been with a
shipping firm. He travels with mamma to
England.
At its recent garden fete the Waitara
Foundling Home was able to record a de-
creasing death rate ; and Mrs. John Toohey
and Miss Egan were patted by Dr. Watkins
for their efforts to add to the comforts of the
youngsters. Governor Strickland, who opened
the rally, was followed by Aide Pasco, R.N.,
the latest addition to the Help Department.
There are all sorts of ways of doing it.
Mrs. Schute got up a raffle for the usual
Belgian Fund, the prize a gemmed ring
given by Mrs. Maeneill Simpson. Mrs.
Fred Pope now flashes it on her finger,
and the fund is the richer by £56.
Lady Edeline is giving an afternoon
party—just a small-and-early wartime
function —for the politician-ladies who are
bringing their husbands to the Premiers’
Conference.. Friday is the time appointed.
About 20 wives are shaking out their finery
for the spread. Governor Strickland gives
the men a mid-day snack in his city lair.
This fortifies them, on May 5, for the offi-
cial opening of the conference an hour
later.
The local restaurant-keeper who has just
fed (for love) a large proportion of the 5000
Hospital collectors is inclined to jib at having
his premises invaded by the healthy hordes
who stick up the city on Belgian Day. Mr.
Arthur Upjohn (Hoffnung’s Chambers) is
therefore organising relief works. Any
housewife who feels disposed to help feed a
lady pirate for one day wflll kindly tell him
what she can contribute to the Town Hall
depot on that occasion—anything, it may
be, from a tea-urn to a few T buns.
The mere husband has some reason to
tremble. Woman is not only tearing her
best rings off her finger points, but she is
recklessly pulling down pictures, taking up
the new mats, and giving half her clothing
(the outer half, such as coney-seal coats)
to the Belgian committee, for auction,
mostly, on May 14.
The Austral String Quartet is only giving
two chamber concerts this season, owing to
the hazy condition of the musical atmosphere
since the enemy pulled on his war togs. After
deducting actual expenses, the profits of
each performance will be thrown into the
Belgian cap. Director Cyril Monk and
scores of other local music-makers can only
possess their bows and fiddles in patience till
Peace blows in.
On Hospital Saturday lady highwaymen
fell upon the plain citizen and relieved him
of well over £lO.OOO. Clubs, offices, theatres
and ferryboats were besieged with collectors.
As usual, the ’rangers didn’t trouble to stick
up their own sex. Women have been gener-
ous and consistent supporters of every war
fund since the trouble began. But money is
not everything. The average girl is out as
well for the annual fun of raiding Man, and
answering his jovial banter. So the petti-
coat passes unchallenged.
The straw-hat brigade loitered round the
Bank of N. S. Wales to throw chippy re-
marks and soulful glances as Beauty sped
past on high-heeled shoes to deliver the
goods. Inside, pallid young men, who had
given up their half-day to lock up the coin,
were distracted by the honeyed smiles of the
conspirators—but they went on counting just
the same. Mrs. .John Ivain gathered over
£OO at the Exchange corner. Matron Creal
(Sydney Hospital) handsomely beat that by
bushrangina about £l5O a little farther on.
Another good stand. King and Castlereagh
streets, brought in £74, with Miss Lawrence
behind the box. Matron Macgregor (Alex-
andra Hospital) boxed another £<() near the
Station, and Matron Beatty (Royal Hospital
for Women) raised the same amount some-
where else. The Nightingales put up a great
light for cash, and the conquering Cap was
übiquitous.
Hugh Ward has been offered the organised
efforts of the Hospital Saturday raiders for
his part of the Belgian Day attack on your
last threepence. May 14 is fixed for these
hostilities.
The horticultural Miss Brace, formerly of
Glen Innes, recently offered her services in
any capacity to help the Red Cross in
France. Lately she was working for Jean
Jacques in a movable French canteen —a
cross between a travelling kitchen and a
perambulating medical chest.
Melba’s forthcoming concert for Poland is
keeping John Lemmone’s nose to the musical
triangle. Offers of help will have to be
removed by contract before the programme is
reduced to reasonable size.
The English Senefelder Club’s litho-
graphs are now on view in Anthony Hor-
derns’ Fine Art Gallery.
The Polish matinde in the Little Theatre
packed that small edifice to its doorstep.
French Consul Chayet, persistent in good
works, took a front chair between Mrs.
George Earp and Mrs. Neville Mayman.
Belgian Consul Watteeuw, who suffers
from his own popularity, flitted from
society flower to bud in the intervals of a
mixed programme. Neville Mayman auc-
tioned a collection of goods that looked as
though they had been raided from the
tramways’ lost property office. Miss Lottie
Gilbert bid highest for a cushion with the
white fowl of Poland painted in the middle.
Mrs. McMurray got two of J. B. Godson’s
water-colors. George Earp, M.L.C., an
easy victim at these affairs, got aw, with
a flag, a picture or two, and a few* other
goods. He only just escaped some home-
made jam by a shilling or so.
The list of Belgian fetes is as long as
your arm, but they all contrive to rake in
shekels. _ Mrs. Hugh Mclntosh is mothering
an affair of the kind on May 11. Its
address is the Mclntosh chalet, Darling
Point.
The tall, experienced Sister Bennett, for
years over the surgical ward in the North
Sydney Hospital, has left for the war zone.
She is a sister of Dr. Agnes Bennett, now.
on her way to the same address.
For those who feel inclined to hop, skip
and jump the Salon de Luxe caters as hand-
somely as it did in the piping times of
peace. Manager Bendrodt is in his old
stand at the top of the marble steps, and will
throw out, with the utmost courtesy, any-
thing that isn’t quite respectable. There was
a big roll-up at Saturday night’s opening of
the season, though local Society had gone to
a first-night show at the Royal. Besides, it
is alleged to have partly pledged itself not
to dance in public again till it does a two-step
for joy over Wilhelm’s final overthrow. Still,
even now the tango girl can apparently rely
on a fair selection of very young sprigs or
elderly beaux. Conductor Billy Romaine is
again in charge of a first-class orchestra.
Nelson Illingworth’s pupils are going to
attack operatic tunes in the Repertory
Theatre on May S and 40. The proceeds
will buy a bone for Belgium’s empty cup-
board.
The Lane Cove centre of the Girls’ Guild
gave a brown-paper parcel auction party the
other evening. This was a kind of charity
gamble. The bidders brought the hammer
down on things disguised in wrapping paper.
Mrs. John Fell was in charge of the meet-
ing, which collected £lOO. Of this, £9O goes
to the Belgian Babies. The Guild retains
10 per cent, out of its innumerable patriotic
efforts to keep itself afloat till the Wilhelm
storm is over.
Police women are suggested for the metro-
politan circuit. Chief Secretary Black ap-
proaches the subject—which is explosive—
with care, and already sees an elephant in
the path. The notion of applying the
feminine paw to softly persuade women
blacksliders to keep the peace is not to be
scoffed at. But the riddle is how to get some-
thing in skirts that is as strong as a
brewer’s horse and yet as gentle as a
kitten.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

“Weak, Anaemic,
“Nervy,” “Run-down”
Get well the “Wincarnis” way- —the quick, sure and safe way to new and
vigorous health. It is the Quick way —because the benefit begins from the firs!
wineglassful, and increases with every additional wineglassful. The Sure waj
—because it has given new health and new life to countless thousands oi
sufferers. And because it is recommended by over 10,000 Doctors. The Safe
way—because it contains no drugs. The first effect of “Wincarnis” is an
immediate stimulation and invigoration of the whole system. This is followed
by an actual up-building of bodily vigor—an up-building that you can feel —and
which gives you more strength and vitality than vou had before. And each
succeeding wineglassful of “Wincarnis” creates still more strength and
still more vitality, until soon your whole body thrills with new health and new
life. Then you can stop taking “Wincarnis.”
But you can still eniov to the full the glorious new health it has given you.
That is where

proves itself of enormous advantage over drugs and drugged wines. Drugs
stimulate, it is true, but it is false stimulation. And drugs make you feel worse
afterwards, because they depress the heart. Read what Mr. Edmunds says: —
“Dear Sirs, —I am delighted with the new health your world-famed
AATnearnis’ has given me. I have had such a busy season that I got ‘run-
down.’ I was intensely weak, and quickly got exhausted. I was induced to
take a wine tonic, which unfortunately made me feel worse than ever. I
discovered afterwards that it contained drugs. So I quickly gave it up and
tried AAuncarnis’ instead. And it is wonderful how speedily AAuncarnis’ has
made me feel a different being. It seemed to put new life into me. I should
never have believed that anything could do me so much good, or do it as quickly
as AYincarnis' has done. I only wish I had tried it before.—Yorvrs faithfully,
“A. S. EDMUNDS, 8-12 Selwyn Road, Cliftonville.”
So you see that the health that “AYincarnis” gives is real and lasting health.
That is the health you want if .you suffer from Anaemia, Weakness, Nerves,
Sleeplessness, Exhaustion, Indigestion, or if you are “Run-down.” And it is
real and lasting health that “AYincarnis” offers you. AA r ill you try just one
bottle?
Begin to get well TO-DAY.
“AYincarnis” is made in England by COLEMAN & CO., Ltd., Wincarnis AYorks,
Norwich. You can buy “AYincarnis” from any AYine Merchant, Licensed
Chemist, or-Orocer, but if you experience any difficulty in obtaining it write

My Dear Yarrie,—,
I have just tottered wearily home from
attending my Ssth charitable auction since
the outbreak of war. Willie Watt played
the leading role. He is a good auctioneer;
in fact, there was a distinct feeling that if
lie chucked politics and took to the ros-
tram for good the nation would be the
gainer. His wife, a fair vision in blue,
stood at his elbow and smiled helpfully,
One item was a parasol 120 years old. Pic-
tore a gamp that Ims survived the assaults
of 120 winters! And then, if you are
anxious to be dazed some more, picture the
artificer who was responsible for it, and
the family which handed it down from
mother to daughter. It was a quaint affair
of brown silk and fringe, only about 12
inches in width, and modelled on the lines
of a motor parasol. Some bride of 120 years
ago is said to have used it on her sunny
nodding d&.Y* J. J. Watson bought it. lie
nlso save some prize pheasants to the
( a use. Ihe latter had to be taken on trust
by the bidders—they were far too nervous
fj' a ll' on a public auction-block. About
»°0 people squeezed into the AA inter Garden
and crushed the Belgian red yellow and
black-red roses and were led by girls
decorated with Belgian flag skirts.
Captain Waters will not hurl himself at
Germany for some time to come, after all.
He was separated from his horse the other
day. Result, a broken arm and many
bruises. The horse escaped unhurt.
Simon Fraser the Younger, who married
Billie Hammond-Clegg a year ago, is off.
He loaves with the next motor-corps.

Melba s voice on luesday was hauntingly
sad. She had suffered severe personal loss
twice within a little while by death. Or
perhaps she was merely tired from hawk-
ing round tickets. Anyhow, the effect was
as of one in great trouble. It reminded
me of the first Patriotic Concert, in the
Auditorium. When that night she sang
“Louise” she was a prima donna inspired,
Few people in the house knew “Louise”—
which is written round the love of Paris.
When Melba first sang it to Melbourne the
Germans were advancing on Paris like a
whirlwind, and the wonderful city seemed
doomed. The singer gave the song with
all her heart in her great voice, and the
people, not even realising what she was
singing, got on their seats and yelled their
applause. She left the platform crying
real tears—tears of grief for Paris. The
other night she was at her emotional best
in the “Forest” song. In the heart of the
songstress “something stirred,” and the
audience heard more than the note of a
bird.
The great concert was stuffed with money
and woodenheads—a different thing from
deadheads. Moneyed people had been
easily cajoled into buying tickets, but they
came without music in their souls. Many
of them- apparently did not know Yankee
Doodle from a Bach prelude, and I expect
they were silently and fervently wishing
for the little ragtime which never came,
You can always tell musical people at a
concert. The men bring goloshes and urn-
brellas and the women wear “clouds”
—invaluable for keeping the hair in
order when the wild suburban blast tears
round the edge of the tram and fills the
landscape with flying dust and newspapers,
Musical people are also particularly strong
on spectacles. But, as I say, there were
liardly any of them present, the chill, hard
seats which they usually affected being
monopolised by the ornately garmented
folks who go to musical comedies in motor-
carg>
„ , rn
Belgian flags were everywhere. Two
electrically-lit firescreens of flags stood
on the platform, and behind them was
the white-clad chorus. The organ opened
the programme, and brought in a
painfuliy Sunday-morning atmosphere. Just
as I was beginning to ponder deso-
lately on my sins and the Hereafter Melba
entered like a dazzling flame, and I cheered
up. Diamonds lit up her hair like a chan-
delier; also they hung round her neck in
ropes. There was a great band of them,
like a Royal order, strapped round her
shoulder and waist As a prominent local
Imperialist sitting behind me remarked to
his wife, Ach Gretchen, it vos vorth the
money to see the joolery alone.’
A composite brigade from both Govern-
ment Houses occupied the customary
salient bang in front of the main army of
concert-goers. They also were well sup-
plied with precious stones, and their various
beads of hair were nicely brushed. Among
them—be still, beating heart!—was the
Rajah of Pudukota, darkly beautiful in the
costume of a butler. There were St. Kilda
lcnuts all over the cheaper seats with more
jewellery (real and imitation) to the square
inch than he had all over him. Such is the
unobtrusiveness of the great!
It took 20 minutes to hand up Melba’s
first lot of bouquets. A touch of romance
was suggested by the fact that she hung
° n to a tiny posy of hyacinths and dropped
everything else like a bag of flour or a cask
of molasses on the stage. Suddenly a girl
squealed ecstatically. She s got mine. In
} ow !, r tones came from her lady-friend near
b - v the one w °rd Liai ‘ ! And then silence,
A very small violinist who looked like a
black ant struggling with a grain of rice
created what I may call a furore. “000,
the dear!” “The perfectly sweet darling!”
“The lore!” “Genius, of course!” You
heard the elevated criticisms on every side.
They could tell he was a Genius, lie wore
a sailor suit and socks,
Lemmone played an inspired little thing
0 f his own on his flexible flute, quite orig-
inal and most melodious,
Parker scared the wits out of the un-
musical crowd by beginning with some
“Ring” Wagner. However, to the general
relief he didn’t persist,
The programme-sellers were some of our

course there were, embarrassed little giggles
and cries of “Ai’m soooo sorry” and “How
quite too foooolish of me,” and through it
all the waiting ushers stood and grew
blacker and blacker in the face with fury.
One particularly envious menial also got
purple, and I fancy I detected a shade d
blue in his countenance. lie was more like
a chameleon than an usher at times,

in peace and allowed to perform their
national dances in fancy costumes and raise
pigs without hindrance, and just as we were
beginning to absorb information of a useful
nature in large masses, someone said wildly
“Where’s the tea?” As a matter of fact,
there wasn’t any. The tea-money had been
set aside for the starving Belgians. Then
the full force of the . war was suddenly
brought home to us.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Galways are back at Government House for
the winter. No doubt they are thankful ; for lied
Cross and other work has compelled them to spend
a lot of time on the road between Norton’s Summit
and town. They can settle down now to do their
chores in comparative comfort.
Mrs. Goldsmith, whose medico husband was a mem-
ber of the first Expeditionary Force, has been doing
hospital work in England since the war broke out,
and has now gone to the Front to organise clubs for
British soldiers in France.
Mrs. Herbert Woodham (she was a Beresf'ord) is
here from Rangoon on a visit.
Professor Henderson’s third and last war lecture
was listened to by Lady Galway and as many of the
populace as the Town Hall would hold. There are
rumors that he is to be implored to repeat the
series.
Details of the death of Major Clough are to hand.
He was on active service in France when he became
seriously ill, and heart failure was the final cause
of death. He got his majority in October of last
year, though he was only 2S.
Prince Alfred won the inter-college sports this
year by 82 points to 29. Lady Galway, who was
there with Miss D’Erlanger and Miss Macaulay,
handed out the prizes at the end of the afternoon.
T. S. O’Halloran, S.M., who was 80 a few days
ago, has been in this State since he was about three.
His father was Major O’Halloran, the early settler
who gave his name to O’Halloran llill. lie went
from the Treasury to the National Bank, and in ’74,
after getting the managership of the Strathalbyn
branch, began his work as an S.M. He knew Pirie
in the early days, when street improvement was a dream,
and high, mud-proof hoots were among the neces-
saries of life, the streets being inches thick in either
slush or dust. He was on the West Coast years
before its possibilities were realised, and saw land
near Port Lincoln sold at 2s. 6d. and 3s. a block.
He is still in harness as an S.M., and is an earnest
worker on behalf of the Consumptive Home.
The agitation in favor of women police looks like
succeeding. One of the few objectors is Salvation
Army Hay. Still, even he reckons it may be worth
trying.
Just died at Woodville, John Norton, R.N., who
joined the Navy in ’O3, and was with the Baltic Fleet
during the Russian War of ’54 and ’55. Under
McClintock he went to the Arctic in search of the
John Franklin expedition, and in the Egyptian War
Of ’B2 he was on the flagship of Admiral Seymour
during the bombardment of Alexandria. It was he
who with the late Capt. Walcot, R.N., fitted out and
brought the Protector to South Aus. in ’B4. His sou
is paymaster of the Sydney.
On Saturday afternoon there was a func-
tion (brace yourself for a shock, my dear)
that had nothing to do with the war. It
was in aid of the St. Kilda-road Deaf and
Dumb Institution. Mrs. Quinnell was secre-
tary for the affair, and the Maddens pushed
it along. The programmes were sold, not
by garrulous Sassiety flappers, but by dumb
boys with appealing eyes and a dexterous
method of plying their wares. They oper-
ated all along the drive, and did good busi-
ness. John Madden had a lot to
say, and despite the fierceness of the
sun’s rays, he took off his hat to
say it. The action amounted to cruelty
to bald heads. A discreet treasurer
disappeared indoors and arrived with a
large gamp, which he held over the august
skull somewhat as a brown maiden would
hold the long-handled ostrich feather palm-
fans over the Queen of Sheba.
The Madden dame, looking pale and
handsome, stood behind her -spouse. Her
bonnet was wreathed with red roses, and
her five-kilted skirt was advaneedly
fashionable. The high steps showed
off the masterpiece in a satisfactory
way. The .Mayoress took bright-blue glace
silk and yellow flowers on to a higher step,
and Mrs. Quinnell put a neat white and
black stripe into the picture. A big, fair
woman with a booming contralto voice stood
on the highest step of all, just at the porch,
and sang about Australia’s martial valor.
The Public, clutching the latest “extraor-
dinary” with a list of killed and wounded
Australians, listened rather tearfully.
After this the party stepped down from
the heights and were shown a tent bazaar-
stall full of mcldes and tomato sauce,
pumpkins and Turks’ caps. Dumb people
offered raffle tickets and talkative people
ran fortune-telling shops and ice-cream
stands and the usual Fancy Work stall.
Frank Mason, son of ex-Speaker Mason,
is to wed Miss Gertrude Hoban, daughter
of the late squatter Hoban, of Tirana, River-
ina. She has been living of late with
brother James, of Goulburn.
Cecil Bowes Kelly, the 11-year-old mem-
ber of the Kelly gang of mining magnates,
fell off a tram last week and damaged him-
self considerably. It was purely accidental
and not a plot to divert the limelight from
hi? elder brother Moncton —the one who is
shortly leaving to be a Turkey-gobbler.
Mrs. Arthur Staughton is at the humble
• —though unthatched —Winter-Irvine cot at
Malvern. Her husband is away braving
the horrors of Timor in quest of oil where-
with to buy his family more motor-cars and
diamonds and other necessary commodities.
Louise Mack is on her way back to Aus-
tralia (she means to lecture about Belgium),
and journalist Amy Mack Harrison may
also return presently. She has not cap-
tured London nor has London captured
her.
I hear that Marie Corelli is writing a
life of Shakspeare. As you know, She lives
at Stratford-on-Avon, and so has the local
atmosphere to a nicety. Arthur Severn,
the artist (a relative, by the way, of
“Monty” Severn, who is known wherever
the social flag waves in Australia), is illus-
trating the work. lie says he is only get-
ting 1000 guineas for it. hut that may be
the family modesty. The friend who gar-
nered these facts for me says that Marie
rakes The Bulletin fore and aft weekly,
and has her walls furnished with original
drawings by Norman Lindsay and other
Australian black-and-whiters.
Old King Cole, of the Book Arcade, who
rarely attends a shivoo these times, made
one of a wedding party at the Savoy last
week, llis son, Yal Cole, had just got mar-
ried to Miss McTavisli. The Arcadian king
gave something more than his benediction
to the happy pair. He gave a house at
Moonee Ponds, where they will abide after
the honeymoon. There are 42 rooms in the
domicile, which is much more than -Mr.
and Mrs. Yal can possibly want at present.
Fisclier-Sabell has arrived. Marshall Hall
heralded .or advance-agented him with rhap-
sodies about his “relaxation method.” It
is supposed to convert vocalists into Melbas
and Carusos as rapidly as shots are tired
from a Maxim gun. He looks like Wotan
out of training. It may be that on the
voyage to Australia he made a mistake and
applied his method to his figure instead of
to his voice.
Harold Colonna, the stout but lovely tenor
whom we knew as Hal Cohen, is a father.
His wife presented him with a daughter
last month. It was lucky for the Hermans,
as Hal —I mean Harold—had intended going
to the Front. Now, of course, he has to
put a curb on his martial fury.
Marie Hall is going back to London.
There’s so much more chance to found a
new religion, or a new method of doing
something in Europe. What else is money
for V
The Woodward sisters (no, they are no I
Tivoli stars, but Bendigo nurses) are off to
London to help with the Australian field
hospital. The ancient mining town has
been heaping nuggets and other appropriate
farewell gifts upon them.
Mrs. Armstrong, wife of the gaitered digni-
tary who attends to Wangaratta’s spiritual
needs, is here in a private hospital with a
broken ankle. So you see Bishops’ wives
have their troubles, after all.
Lady Stanley motored to Trinity College
Hostel on Thursday last and unveiled a por-
trait of Janet Lady Clarke, who founded the
place. It is by Fred McCubbin, and hangs
in the dining-room.
A permanent Jumble Shop has arrived al
Commerce House, Flinders-street. Jumbles
will be available every Monday, Wednesday
and Friday afternoon from 2..‘>0 to f>, dur-
ing the whole of May and June. Sassiety
women of unimpeachable position will ex-
tract the public’s money, and everu penny is
to go lo the Belgians. Everything in the
place (from musical instruments and incu-
bators, to cakes and ale) has been given free,
so there should be some bargains about.
A number of Federal politicians, headed
by Prime Minister Fisher, tore themselves
away from their country’s business on
Saturday afternoon and played bowls
against the St. Kilda club. George Turner,
who was once a politician and is still a
bcwler, welcomed them, and play was in-
dulged in steadily between refreshments.
Bowls is not a very spectacular game, but
it is more thrilling than cricket, and seems
to just fit Mr. Fisher’s size in dignity. Two
Cabinet Ministers had tea at my table, and
I watched them closely. But they did noth-
ing unusual. They held their cup and
saucer in their left hand and their cream
puff in their right, and ate with their
mouths. Neither attempted to eat with his
ears. They were so nice and tame that
nobody meeting them for the first time
would suspect that they were only waiting
for their chance to destroy the Marriage
Tie.
Molly Carew is to be married to a doctor
named Smith. The thing would look like a
form of plagiarism, so often has it been
done before, were he not a native of Shel-
ton, Stoke-on-Trent. This supplies that
touch of the unusual which is needed to
relieve the situation. You will remember
that she became a professional musician a
few years ago, despite the fact that her
people were in the softgoods line and hence
affluent.
Miss Bateman, of Melbourne, is illus-
trating what women can do for the Bel-
gians -or any other victims of German
mania. She has put up a pair of diamond
earrings—on view at Kozminski’s—to be
raffled for at a shilling a chance for the
benefit of the fund. The single stones are
said to be worth £lOO each, and they look
it. Any number of women, who can afford
shillings for tickets, possess valuable bits of
jewellery which they profess to be tired of.
They might contribute thousands of pounds
in all to the Funds by taking in one
another’s raffles, so to speak.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“Te f’abarantlko”: The Chow’s straw

used by the same class of people in Japan as rain
and snow coats, with hats to match; but it makes
me fatigued to hear it glorified as ag-ainst the com-
mon-sense oilskin. I have a vivid recollection of a
crowd of longshore coolies discharging a cargo of
coal to the arsenal on the Yang-tze-kiang, a few
weeks after the China-Jap war broke out, in a spell
of very wet and very raw weather. When waiting for
lighters the steaming, semi-decayed scarecrows passed
the time pleasantly and industriously (a Chow is
that if he is anything) picking Norfolk Howards off
each other's envelopes and setting them adrift on

overlanding. That’s a wire-netting fence. They put
their heads through the mesh and perish, owing to
their inability or disinclination to back out. There
are two things that no man has seen —the good time
that’s coming and the turtle that will go astern.

“The Bantam’’: Along the channel
country near Echuca (Vic.), where drought has been
wiping out the flocks, the bone-gatherer is abroad.
For the asking he can have the perishing beasts, and
he generally reaches for them while they have strength
enough to walk to a convenient spot to be dealt
with. The manure-dealer is also reaping a gruesome
harvest. Thousands of jumbueks will accompany
next season’s sowings into the sod. Verily, all flesh
is grass—or its equivalent !

“Eddyson” : “There’s manny a fine ghost
in Bungaree, let me tell yeh,” said Flynn. “The
Colemans was livin’ at Bungaree a year, maybe,
when first public inthrest, accompanied wid ar-rgu-
mint, was ’roused be the goin’s on in their house iv
nights. Coleman is a tall, calm man ordin’ry, ’n’
Ann Coleman hersilf is wan iv thim weemin’ looks
ez if they was made in a basin, ’n’ never disposed t’
trouble her fat at all, sleepin’ ’r wakin’. ’Tis
onusual ’n' startlin’ t’ hear high oaths, ’iT cries iv
anguish, ’n’ the smashin’ iv chiny, ’u’ other indica-
tions iv hostilities ’n’ dissension coinin’ frim tile pro-
perty iv a woman wouldn’t get up t.’ t’row a boot
et a cat, ’n’ a man is gentle-spoken aven wid a
cow. ’Tis goin’ on a month, ’n’ the neighbors is
makin discreet reference t’ Ned Coleman ’n’ invitin’
the confidence iv herself consarnin’ the racket ’n’ the
ividint dishtruction iv property, but herself is
turnin’ the conversation t’ trivyill mathers alwuz, ’n’
himself is sayin’ the sun's perticlder war-rm fer the
time iv the year. One night, howsomever, Misthress
Coleman comes driftin’ into Walsh’s kitchen, boldin’
her ear. ‘An’ will yeh lave me be the shmolderin’
fire,’ sez she, ‘a whoile?’ ‘Yer ear’s hurted, ma’am,’
sez Mrs. Walsh. ‘lt is that, but not mor-rtal.’ ‘An’
there s big noise iv callin’ ’n’ smashin’ in yer house
beyant, ma’am?’ ‘Tbrue, there is. ’Tis Ned ’n’ me
mother. Ye’ll not hade them at all, will yeh, but
git t’ yer bed again kindly, an’ lave me be the fire,
where I’ll sit till all’s still.’ Mrs. Walsh left her
there, an’ the riot went on a half-hour more.
Another night late Misthress Coleman come ag’in.
tis disprit sorry I am t’ inthrude on yeh, ma’am,’
she sez; ‘but yill hear Ned an’ me mother is at ’it,’
sez she. ‘An’ when thim two gets dishputin’ ’tis a
wise coorse t,’ lave them the house t’ thimsilves.
They nade it! Mrs. Walsh is willin’ t’ give shelther,
but is consumed intire wid the curiousness. ‘But,
ma am,’ sez she, ‘why are ye doin’ nothin’ t’ put
an end t’ the great, ondecent quarrelsomeness ?’ ‘ ’Tis
nothin I can do at all, laments Mrs. Coleman ;
‘nothin’ never ’r ever. When Ned an’ his ma-in-
law gets goin’ on their old disagreements the Devil
himsilf would fare bad bechune thim.’ Mrs. Walsh
is afther tell in’ all thim developmints t’ the neigh-
bors, an’ the wonther’s grown triminjis, becaze
there’s no mother-in-law annywhere a body kin see.
Whin the Colemins kim t’ Bungaree no ould woman
was, wid the luggage, ’n’ none has bin seen since.
‘ ’N’ where are yeh keepin’ yer ould mither-in-law,
Coleman? sez Ryan wun day, ‘D'veh pack her to
a cupboard, ’r tie her t’ the bed, ’r what?’ Coleman
stands up, sthraight, an’ tall, an' impressive. ‘An’
go t’ Hell, Don Ryan!’ sez he. So the domestic
varyance continues et Coleman's a good six months,
an’ the mystery iv it have got all in a shtatc iv
dishturbance bortherin’ on madness. Then comes
the night when Ann Coleman totters to Walsh’s
kitchen wid her head broke elane across wid a
stool, an’ Weedin’ profuse. ‘ 'Tis Ned an’ me ma
ag’in,’ sez she. ‘I was took wid the sate he troo,
an’ would yeh tie me poor head up kindly?’ “’Tis
a thriminjis hit,’ sez Mrs. Walsh, ‘an’ I’d have Con-
shtable ITooley see to it. ’Tis a question fer the
law wid a crack that size lengthways in yer head,
ma’am.’ But Ann Coleman will not hear iv it. ‘Me
man is as kind a one as breathes air,’ sez she. ‘An’
’twas not for me but for me ma, an’ I was not
quick. Bein slow, ’tis me own fault, in a manner
iv speakin’. Ned never did get on wid his ma-in-
law. They was quarr’lin’ ’n’ quarr’lin’ day ’n’
night when we lived et Wallace, away.’ Mrs. Walsh
shtopped washin’ an’ tidyin’ up the hurted head of
her. ‘Ye 11 not till me that tale anny more,’ sez
she. ‘Becaze why—l’m not believin’ a wor-rd iv it.
There’s no mother-in-law in yer house at all.’ ‘Yer
wrong, ma’am,’ sez Mrs. Coleman. ‘Thin how comes
no wan iver sees her or hears her?’ ‘I don’t see her
nor hear her misilf. On’y, Ned sees ’n’ hears her,
n the why of it I’ll tell yeh in confidence, Mrs.
Walsh. ’ Tis becaze she’s dead!’ ‘Dead!’ squeals
Mrs. Walsh. Ann nods her head. ‘Dead!’ she sez.
‘Dead these five years gone, but never so dead she
can resist from interferin’ in family mathers.’ Mrs
Coleman sighed deeply. ‘Ned is long-forbearin’,’ sez
she, ‘but ye know what mothers-in-law ar-rc!’ ”
“Bill Mickory”: I and many other con-
firmed bushmen in Western Queensland, having
noticed dead eoolibali up to about 18in. in diameter
standing with their trunks submerged in water in
the middle of permanent waterholes, hereby call ten-
ders for some information thereon. Along the Lebine
Creek, out from Cunnamulla, there is a dimple,
never known to be less than 11 mile long, and always
a swim for a bullock for the last 37 years, which
has dead trees standing in about 15ft. of water. I
want to know how they got there. Only two reasons
occur to me, both of which seem very improbable:
(1) A drought of severity never yet experienced in
Australia, extending over some years; (2) compara-
tively sudden change in rainfall.
A RELIGION EXPLAINED.
LEEDLE IKE: “Aindt dey curious people,
farder, doze Parsees!”
BIG Ik E: " Vy is dot, my poy?”
LEEDLE IkE : “Dey vorship fire.”
BIG I KE: “Dot is all righd. Of course dey vos all veil insuret.”
“Florence” : The ways they have in south-
ern Maoriland. Campbell MePheerson was tali, raw-
boned and freckled, with the stiff red hair that har-
monises with such ugliness, but with blue eyes that
were like jewels astray in a barnyard. Perhaps it
was the gladness of his eye that won the favor of
Nancy. But Campbell was a son with a due rever-
ence for his father, and when one winter’s night in
the kitchen he won a whispered “Yes,” Campbell,
with streaming kilts, bolted for home on the instant,
his bonnet still on the door swinging open behind
him. A minute or two later, rushing into his father’s
kitchen, where the old man was furtively drinking
something hot with the parson, he shouted: “She’ll
ha’ me father —shall I ring her?” “Nancy, ye
mean?” asked the old man. “Yes, father.” “Oh,
aye!” said father. Then Campbell sprinted back
across the paddock to where that other door still stood
ajar, produced something in gold from his waistcoat
pocket, and Nancy was duly “ringed.” then they
sat down together, had a place of parritch, and a
tune or two on the bagpipes.
THE WORST HAD
HAPPENED.
J.P.: “ You're discharged."
DUSTBIN DAVE: “Wil An' after the cops
'as given me a barf! Blimey, I might's
well stop now!”
“Lou”: Australia’s best burning wood is
the Bananaland stinking gidya, adjectived because the
foliage hums in wet weather. There are two brands
—pink and red. They are found mostly in the north-
west, and both burn bright, long, hot and to a fine
clean white ash. This is the stuff to pop a damper
into. The tree wouldn’t shade a bookmaker’s con-
science, but it would steady those Gippsland cheese-
wood axemen.
“Pick”: Another relation of “Boronia’s”
cobbler and “Tridit’s” bullrout is the fortescue,
found in the rocky shallows and among the oyster-
beds of coastal lakes. He resembles a granny-shark
in shape, and, like most rock-fish, his color harmo-
nises with the mud or sand upon which he camps, so
that he is very hard to see. Although rarely more
than three inches' long, he can lift the unsuspecting
fisher or oysterman who planks down a bare foot
upon his spiky back with the force of an 80-ton gun
or thereabouts. Those who have fully appreciated
his sting declare there is no cessation of the madden-
ing pain until the next turn of the tide. A similar
belief is held regarding a puncture from the sting-
ray. I knew a cove who did half of six weeks on
crutches as an after-result of a prod from a
fortescue.
* * * •
“Vegetarian”: Along the Papuan littoral
the colored folk have a great fall-back food in times
of drought in the fruit or seed of the red man-
grove, which is collected by the women and turned
into quite acceptable ballast for
their tired husbands and energetic
children. The young green pods
are first of all soaked for a
couple of days in the sea, then
shredded into a sort of oakum,
and after another prolonged soak-
ing in sea water are cooked by
boiling in two waters. The soak-
ing is to remove the poisonous
juices, mostly some sort of tannic
acid. After the final boiling there
remains a messy substance not un-
like vermicelli, with a mixture of
cornflour to thicken it. Another
stand-by, when the inadequate and
badly-planted gardens fail, is the
common sea urchin. This, also,
is hunted down and bagged by the
long-suffering females and turned
into a relish for the mangrove
custard. Seaweeds of sorts are also put into the
pot, as well as starfish, sea spiders and other marine
fantods.

“Bruni” : I found myself in tie Hobart
Domain listening to a soul-saver clad in a rusty
flogger and a black eye. In explanation of the murky
eye he opened his discourse this way: “Friends, you
see this! laying a podgy finger on the purple patch.
Delighted answers in the affirmative from the crowd.
I will tell you how I got it,” he proceeded. “On
lhuisday I took a ton of wood to Newtown, and,
after unloading it, started to sow the good seed.
I was jeered at, and one hardened sinner struck me
in the eye with a potato. It was a cruel blow, but
in the face of adversity I could bless the Lord that
my erring brother had not thrown a brick.”

THE BELLE OF STRINGYBARK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our belle was not as other belles; a freckled face
had she,
But there was always sunshine in her eyes,
Except, of course, at night-time, when, you take it
straight from me,
They mirrored all the planets in the skies.
Her dress was quite audacious —her father’s pants
would do !
I guess she never wore a gown of silk.
But she was wire and whipcord—real Australian
through ar.d through—•
And you should see her bail the cows and milk!
She wasn't sweet and dainty in your pampered city
way,
She didnA frisk and frolic like a lamb ;
She had her own opinions ; yes, and, when she said
her say,
She wasn’t over-backward with a “damn.”
But, oh! her lure for lovers! There was honey in
her voice
When honeyed words were called for. But, of course,
They were not always called for in the yakker of
her choice —-
And couldn’t she just harness up a horse!
Her hair was not the city sort, all built up in a
pile;
It hung about her shoulders anyhow,
And though your modes be pretty—well, (hey hardly
are the style
In a yard that’s full of mud and muck—and cow!
But at the old bush dances, in the wattled shearing
sheds,
I’ve seen that self-same, wild, disordered hair
Turn fellows who were cynics completely off their
heads—■
And couldn’t she just ride the bucking mare!
Her boots—well, I have seen her wear a pair of
brother Bill’s
(And brother Bill was over six-feet tall).
And you should see her wheeling wild-eved cattle in
the hills,
And riding where another’s horse would fall!
And if I ever missed my hat (you know the old
bush sort,
With sweat beneath the band, and flapping rim),
I knew that she was wearing it—for use, and not for
sport—-
Down where the freckled mermaids used to swim.
She wasn t saint and sugar, in sedate proportions
mixed
(<)ur love would all have vanished if she were!);
But when water needed carting, or fencing got
unfixed,
’Twas safe to bet your life that Nell was there.
She wasn’t quite a, scholar, though I swear she
scratched her name
One day upon a tree, and spelt it right;
But when the cask was empty, and her father never
came,
She's gone and killed a sheep by candle-light!
I wonder where is Nellie now. She seemed a trifle
sweet
On Sandy Doyle, who lived at Hollow Log.
(I mind old Sandy riding in the rain and in the
heat,
His old bay neddy followed by a dog.)
But Sandy was a backward cuss, and didn’t make
the pace,
Perchance because he didn't have the knack ;
And I wonder, and I wonder, when I think of Nellie’s
face,
If he’s still as lorn and lonely—riding back.

BEAUTY DOCTOR TELLS
SECRET.
A Beauty Doctor Gives Simple Recipe
to Darken Grey Hair and Promote
Its Growth.
Miss Alice Whitney, a well-known beauty
doctor, recently made the following state-
ment : “Anyone can prepare a simple mix-
ture at home, at very little cost, that will
darken grey hair, promote its growth and
make it soft and glossy. To half a pint of
water add loz. of bay rum, a small box of
Orlex Compound and ioz. of glycerine. These
ingredients can be bought at any chemist’s at
very little cost. Apply to the hair twice a
week until the desired shade is obtained.
This will make a grey-liaired person look
20 years younger. It is also fine to pro-
mote the growth of the hair, relieve itch-
ing and scalp troubles, and is excellent for
dandruff and falling hair.” 110

“Ibis”: Bush chimneys take many shapes.
A square iron tank with one side knocked out is
popular as a fireplace. The side with the manhole
is put nearest the clouds, and the smoke exits, more
or less, through this opening. I’ve seen chimneys
made of oil-drums set end to end, so as to make a
kind of ship’s funnel ; of wooden irrigation flume
with the open side boarded in ; and one made of bran
bags stretched on a sapling framework. Rut the
most picturesque chimney T know is on the Com-
boyne tableland (N.S.W.), where a selector has built
his hut with one end against the butt of a hollow-
tree. The fireplace is an opening- cut into the foot
of the herb. An oblong branch shooting out almost
at right angles to the trunk has been used as part
of the ridge-pole of the dwelling. The smoke finds
its way out through knot-holes and broken branch
sockets all the way up the stem.
MEMORIES.
HE: “And has my lovey ever felt like this
before?"
HIS LOVEY (the pub lean's daughter): “Not
since I was a weeny child and used to sit
on puppa's hogsheads.”
“F.A.W.” : O’Donnell had the bad luck to
lose a hand, and 1 went to condole with him. “Any-
way,” I urged cheerfully, “it’s a blessing it wasn’t
jour right hand.” “That’s the curse av it,” an-
swered he. “For ut was in me left hand was all me
fortune—a big legacy an’ a long life, an’ a journey
by sea. ’ I gathered he had recently consulted a
palmist who found all this cheerfulness on his left
hand. Now the paw and its prophetic marks were
gone. His wailing followed me to the gate. “Och,
wirra, wirra! The grand legacy, an’ me long life,
an’ the journey by sea—all gone, all gone!”
“Kodak”: I think it is time the facts (in-
vented bv myself) of the Boojums’ final separation
were made known. When Boojum accidentally
became aware that Mrs. Boojnm was another’s, and
that he was merely the official bill-payer, he laid bis
plans. He had a sense of humor, and a maddening
capacity for taking pains, and he spread himself over
this job. It was to be in the nature of a send-off
to Mrs. B. and her gentleman friend, both of whom
were apparently well satisfied with the existing
arrangement. The Boojums’ neighbors didn’t know
anything until the very moment the magazine ex-
ploded. It was 10 o'clock on Tuesday (Boojum’s
lodge night) when there was a startling bang from
the bottom of the Boojums’ garden and a flaming
firework bomb whirled into the air, to burst in a
cascade of brilliant white stars. As the neighbors
rushed to windows, balconies and gates, a flight of
rockets tore aloft and woke up the dark skies some
more. Then, from a second-storey window on the
opposite side of the street, a powerful searchlight
flooded the front of the Boojum house with white
rays, while three others at different points did the
same for the three other sides of the house. Just
about then a traitorous hand switched on all the
electrics in the Boojum mansion and set the gramo-
phone howling a ragtime song, while a hitherto con-
cealed brass band marched out of the tennis court
playing “This Is the Life for Me.” The only inter-
ruptions were the upward rushes of the rockets, the
cheers of the watching thousands and the deafening
explosions of the bombs. Just when the band was
about played out five motor-loads of male choristers
drew up in front of the house and sang “Sleep,
Beloved, Sleep,” while a set piece of firework on the
lorry behind them flamed and crackled till it formed
the word “WELCOME.” The performance had been
scheduled to stop here; but the onlookers, who had
mistaken it for a silver-wedding celebration and been
worked up to a tremendous pitch of enthusiasm,
swarmed round the front fence and poured into the
garden shouting “Speech! Speech!” They got no
speech ; but Mrs. Boojum at length appeared on the
balcony and had a most convincing fit of hysterics,
while a shadowy male figure in the background re-
peatedly called everybody and everything “Dddd—d
cowardly curs!” Then the gathering silently dis-
persed, the expiring fireworks flickered out, the
gramophone ran down, and there was nothing left but
a woman's wild sobbing and the smoke of expended
gunpowder.
“The Reefer”: “Outcast” (B. 25/3/T5)
doesn’t believe that our discolored brethren of the
South Seas are intentionally cruel. Well, 1 do. At
Kirema (Papua) one afternoon 1 was trying to doze,
but couldn’t on account of the yelling of natives in
the village adjacent. I turned out and investigated.
About 50 young bucks, clad in a full suit of cocoanut
oil, and with their hair bedecked with frangipanni and
hibiscus blossoms, were assembled in a circle. Inside
this circle were two big pigs lying trussed on the
sand. Standing astride them were two natives
pressing arrows into the animals’ lungs and working
them round and round. The struggles and squeals of
the pigs upended my hair. Every now and then
one of the laughing-, boisterous onlookers would rush
in and pound the victims with his feet or fists to add
to their agony. AA hen I took a hand and went
baresark myself, it seemed extremely likely that I
would be treated as the pigs were. Again, at Motu-
Motu, the nigs, had caught a 12ft. crocodile nap-
ping. AY hen I happened along there were three stout
poles across him on which
a number of the popula-
tion sat pinning the big
rate to the sand. They
nail a slit in his belly
about a foot long, through
which they had tugged
some yards of his interior.
A blood-bespattered, gor-
illa-like old man holding
the mess in his hands
pranced and capered to
the screaming enjoyment
of the concourse. A final
instance. The Samoan
evangelist at Moviavi,
knowing my weakness for
boiled chicken, got his
most useful pupil to pre-
pare a pullet. After ex-
changing greetings on his
front verandah we mean-
dered to the back, where
his wife, surrounded by a
crowd of pot-bellied Pap-
uan youngsters, sat pluck-
ing my fowl alive. Notic-
ing my amazment he ex-
plained: “Oh, feather he
come out very good s’posc fowl he no dead. But
s'pose he dead, feather he altogether too strong.”
He chuckled as though it was a prime joke when I
explained to his flock my disapproval of the custom.
“Eon”: Some rare specimens come along
the dusty Mallee tracks at times. A cove went
leisurely past one day with his swag in an oil-
drum, which had a handle on it like a lawn-mower.
Another had his knot in an iron wheelbarrow. But
ihe one tore madly past on a scorching day in patent-
leather dancing pumps, dungarees, stiff "shirt, cuffs
flying loose, no coat, vest or hat, a loaf of dodger
under one wing, and a double-barrelled gun under
the other. I think he was racing a cloud of “pinkie”
jim-jams for a wager.
“Pink”; When our race club called for
applications for the position of starter one came from
a man who wrote that, although he had held office as
starter at only one small race-meeting, he had several
times acted as M.C. at balls in his district. He
reckoned that starting darnces and starting horse-
races were about the same thing. Perhaps he was
right, but the committee did not chance it.
THE KNOCK-OUT.
BENNO: “Wot ! That the tom yer goin' ter marry —that!”
B ILLO: “Yes; wot's wrong wiv her?”
BENNO: “Wrong wiv her! Why , she's LAME!”
BILLO: “Well, yer don't suppose I want ’er fer racin', do yer?”
“Silas Snell”: The Wesleyan Chapel at
Waddy was the sanctuary in which I received my
religious education. The good men of the chapel
were as eager for “attractions” as any theatrical
management, and Happy Bastow was always wel-
come. Happy Bastow came out from Ballarat. He
was what might fairly be called the leading com-
edian of a score of Methodist churches in the Ballarat
district. Happy was a tall, thin, lugubrious Cornish-
man, a stonebreaker by profession, but a mighty
mover in prayer and a very popular eccentric on the
platform. Wherever Happy Bastow was billed to
appear the chapel filled to the doors, and great work
was supposed to be doing. His prayers were wholly
ungrammatical, and were given with a bovine roaring
that shifted the shingles of the little chapel. Nobody
understood them, but many a sinner plunged in the
fountain, awed into repentance by the terrific yells
of the inspired stonebreaker. Not praying, however,
but the giving out and singing of hymns was Happy
Bastow’s big pull. Happy sang the hymns to any old
tune that came into his head, and after singing the
chorus would break into a sort of shuffling dance
after the manner of the serio-comic of his day and
generation. At one big revival meeting his prayers
ami his great song-and-dance turn prostrated a whole
chapelful of good Cornish Christians in something
like a grand unanimous fit of holiness. Then Happy
went forth, overcome, and stole all the handiest hats
hanging in the porch. There had been mysterious
shortages of hats at dozens of Happy Bastow's meet-
ings, and no one had dreamed of accusing the wild
revivalist; but this act of vandalism led to a search
of Happy’s three-roomed house at Sebastopol and an
amazing discovery. Two rooms of the three were
packed with stolen hats. There were hundreds of
them, and now the awful truth was known —Bastow
had become a revivalist only because of the opportu-
nities it gave him for stealing hats. He had a mania
for hats. When being tried in the Ballarat Police
Court Happy put up a great speech for the defence
after the manner of one of his rafter-shifting exhor-
tations. And he might have got off only unfortu-
nately while he was asserting his innocence with
greatest ardor and most holy vehemence a police-
sergeant’s cap fell out of his coat.
“\Y a.vback”: We had been cursing,
abundantly and with the earnestness due to a just
cause, a plague of mice. All manner of traps we
could contrive had failed to be of any assistance
until one morning Bill found two little devils in
the honey-pot. He was just going to say something
vulgar when his face lighted up, and he said
Hoo-blankv-ray !” instead. “Three or four inches of
honey in a kerosene-tin,” he explained, “will settle
the purple blighters.” It did. lYe had that plague
broken up in a week.

IN A DEVIL OF A HURRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Sunny Plains we missed a dray,
And, two miles further on,
I heard the driver softly say :
“I thought that we were gone!”
The motor purred, the cool wind hummed,
The rustling road-grit flew ;
Through muddy pools we splashed and slummed,
For we were over-due.
A country woman shelling peas
Looked up—and we were past!
A swaggie lying at his ease
Howled from a glade, well-grassed.
Some children cheered us from a fence ;
An old man, lone and sad,
Stared at the passing car immense
As though he thought 11s mad.
Past houses of a slower age
With tlireat’ning hoots we fled ;
Another town, another stage,
Of our fierce journey dead !
For those who sanely went a-foot
It was a Sunday's stroll
From where we gave our last loud hoot
To save our petrol soul.
Our eyes were on the road ahead ;
Our hands our hat-brims held ;
The stones beneath our hot wheels sped ;
The wind with fury yelled.
Life stood aghast as we roared by,
And free birds .sought the heath;
But on a hill, close to the sky,
A graveyard showed its teeth.
We left it like the other things;
It swept behind —away !
And we whirled on with Frenzy’s wings
The further miles to slay.
But, ’midst the pines, upon the hill,
I dreamed 1 saw a wreath
Bearing a card: “At last he's still —-
This speed-hog underneath!’’

THE Overland is a car of remark-
able safeness and endurance
because it has extraordinary
strength in every part.
We supply forgings in the Overland
at many points where castings are
used in other cars. Forgings are
stronger and lighter. They cost the
average smaller manufacturer so
much more that he cannot afford to
use them. They cost us no more
because we make so many Overland
cars that we can afford to own and
operate our own drop forging plant.
In many cars the front axle is made
of two pieces, welded together. The
front axle of the Overland is drop
forged from a single piece. This
greatly increases strength.
In like manner, the Overland is
designed and built throughout to
withstand greater strains than it will
ever receive. It is not an “assembled”
car, made of parts built by various
other manufacturers. Almost every
part of the Overland is built by
The Willys-Overland Company. Its
strength and unusual endurance have
been amply proved by years of use
on the worst of roads.
The Overland is on display at the
local show-rooms.

Why Sore Throat is so Prevalent.
THESE three striking illustra-
tions reveal at once the reason
why Sore Throat, in all its varied,
painful and depressing forms, in-
cluding Tonsillitis, is so common
a complaint; how it may be readily
cured, on the one hand, and effec-
tually prevented on the other.
Sore Throat and Tonsillitis,
with other infectious diseases, like
Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, Measles,
Mumps, Whooping-cough and
Consumption, are due to germs.
These float in the air, settle and
develop in the throat. In vigorous
health, they are destroyed by the
blood. If, however, the individual
is below par the blood is not able
to contend against the rapidity
with which the germs multiply,
and he gets the disease whose
germs he has inhaled.
o
During the winter disease-germs
are particularly prevalent, for the
weather conditions are then most
favourable to their growth. People
with Sore Throat and Tonsillitis ;
those sickening for the diseases
already mentioned, and convales-
cents from them, are constantly
passing through the streets, and
going to theatres, music-halls, con-
certs, and other public gatherings.
Not only do they exhale germs
which infect the air, but they carry
a great deal of dust with them.
The dust particles, like the sooty
particles in fogs, act as rafts to
float the germs into the throat.
It is obvious, therefore, that these
germs must be destroyed to prevent
them destroying us.
Their enormous number is sug-
gested by Figs, i and 2.
Fig. i represents a microscope
plate which was exposed for a short
time to the air and afterwards kept
for two days at the temperature of
M

Fig. 2. How dust germs develop in two days.
Fig. 3. How Formamint prevents any development of air and dust germs.
the human body. The white dots
represent the growth of colonies of
germs, seen under the microscope.
Bach dot contains thousands of
germs.
Big. 2 is a similar plate exposed
to fine dust and treated in the same
way. The colonies of germs car-
ried by it are seen as the white
patches on the plate, the blurred
and fainter markings being the
particles of dust themselves.
Fig. 3 is a similarly-exposed
plate which was previously dis-
infected with saliva containing
Wulfing’s Formamint, the pleasant-
tasti ng throat tablet which a
physician, writing in one of the
leading medical periodicals, re-
cently declared was “ Unquestion-
ably the germ-destroyer of the
age.” The power of Wulfing’s
Formamint is adequately proved
by the fact that neither from the
air nor from the dust were any
germs able to develop. In other
words, Formamint completely
killed all the germs. It is, there-
fore, a trustworthy cure for Sore
Throat, and a complete preventive
of diseases whose germs multiply
in the throat.
The highest medical testimony
endorses these statements of the
efficacy of the preparation. The
Chief Medical Officer of one of
our largest Infectious Diseases’
Hospitals states in one of the
leading medical journals, “ I
have never had Sore Throat myself
since I began to use Wulfing’s
Fonnamiut, although I suffered
periodically before.”
Another physician writes in the
Practitioner : “ Having tried all
the British Pharmacopoeia
lozenges, and most of the well-
known proprietary antiseptic
lozenges, I have become reduced
to one, and one only (for sore
throat), namely, Formamint.”
Over ten thousand doctors have
also written describing the re-
markable results they have ob-
tained in curing the various forms
of Sore Throat and Tonsillitis, and
preventing the diseases mentioned
above, by Wulfing’s Formamint.
Of all Chemists, price 2/6d. per
bottle. All imitations of Forma-
mint are worthless. Insist on
having Wulfing’s Formamint.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“N’importe”: Next to Port Said, where
change of a sovereign is likely to include any
coin current from Lapland to Macquarie
Island, Papeete is the dead end. There,
in the small retail trade, prices are quoted
in American currency, payment accepted
from travellers in British gold or silver, and
the change handed back in French coinage.
It takes some quick thinking to ascertain
how one stands at the end of a transaction.
Recently a Jew bought an article from a
Chow shop at Papeete for four dollars, ten-
dered a sovereign, and received five francs
change. Strange as it may sound, the Jew
explained that the Chow had given him back
too much money, that, four dollars was
Ids. Sd., and that the change should be only
3s. 4d., while he had been given the equiva-
lent of 4s. lie concluded by pushing over
Bd. in English coinage. The Chow, recog-
nising that the age of miracles is not yet
past, bowed to a higher wisdom and took the
cash. On another occasion a party of eight
went for a motor drive which cost six dollars.
The treasurer, whose strong point was not
finance, gave the chauffeur two sovereigns
and received back 20 francs. With a worried
look he proceded to collect each man’s share.
The first two were dead easy, for they paid
3f.75 each. No. 3, for himself and
two others, threw half a sovereign on the
table and grabbed 1f.25 out of kitty.
The treasurer now appeared really anxious.
No. G weighed in a dollar, and levied on the
pool for 1f.25 also. Cold sweat broke, out
on the treasurer’s forehead. No. 7, desiring
to clear out his odd cash, threw in a florin.
50 centimes, 1 dime and a threepenny-bit.
Then the treasurer fainted.
* * * *
“Petrian”: How is it that the average
Australian Billjim so seldom goes into the
business of manufacturing pants? The
other day the Commonwealth called for
tenders to cover Tommy Kangaroo’s legs.
Here are the names of some of the tenderers
to whom contracts were given: Sprecker-
man; Cohen and Sons; Karpinsky and
Freedman; Z. J. Jacobs; S. Weingott and
Sons ; G. Lotze ; Goldstein Bros.; Hofren ;
S. Steigrad; Gruntner and Heifer; W.
Jacobs : F. Goldstein ; Abraham and Sons ;
,T. Papier. Anyone not in the know might
think that Moses had been calling for ten-
ders to clothe the army of Israel.
* * * *
That quaint Victorian burlesque, the
Burnley egg-laying competition, closed the
other day with great feather-flapping be-
cause of five world’s records. The eggs
laid by tbe six winning ladies totalled 1699
—almost exactly seven eggs per duchess
every nine days—and they were worth, at
Is. 2d. per dozen. £8 ss. 2d. The records
reflect great credit on the Australian hen,
but what availeth the achievement when
wheat is Bs. (id. a bushel and it costs 7s. Gd.
to bring a fowl from the egg to the table?
What would be really interesting would be
a record of the number of chooks that have
had their necks screwed lately because they
wouldn’t lay 19 eggs in seven days and find
their own tucker.
* * * *
“Rita S.”: About the only venture that
is paying in the Northern Vic. irrigation
latitudes just now is the ostrich farm at
Bamawm. The big birds were brought by
special train from Coonamble, were given
a rest and feed at Wodonga, and arrived in
great form. When unloaded at Strathallan,
near Echuca, a number of the fowls upheld
their reputation for cussedness by bolting
down the steep banks of the Campaspe and
swimming the stream, instead of footing it
comfortably over the bridge. Now they are
justifying their presence in the lucerne pas-
tures by producing fine plumes, which bring
a better price than the South African orna-
ments do. Despite war, drought and other
troubles, there is a keen demand for the
feathers. There are about 350 ostriches on
the lucerne at Bamawm, but no chickens
were hatched last season, owing to a likely
shortage of provender. The eggs went to
the Echuca pastry cooks, who used the con-
tents, and returned the shells to the farm,
whence they passed to Melbourne to be made
into curios.
“Sero”: Of course, Australians are no
use when you can import a foreigner, but
sometimes you just have to take what you
can get. Eighteen months ago the Goff’s
Harbor (N.S.W.) Butter Co. got hold of a
native-born youngster named Bennett, yet
in his twenties. At that time the factory
was in debt, but the Australian sapling has
shifted the curse, and the other day
a 0 per cent, dividend was paid. At
the recent show at Sydney he secured
first prize of £50 against all comers
in the continuous judging class, easily
the most important event in the but-
ter line. He also secured the Coastal
Farmers’ special prize for tin* greatest
aggregate number of points in all classes of
butter.
“Hamer”: Another anti-Australian super-
stition has gone by the board. On the
N.S.W. North Coast the local hoop-pine is
now being largely used for making butter-
boxes. It would have been used long ago,
but as something must be found to discredit
any Australian article the superstition was
spread that the local pine tainted the butter.
So the foolish business of importing wood
for butter-boxes flourished until, with proper
seasoning of tin; wood, the alleged
taint was found to he a myth. Now a
sawmill is employing a hundred men on
the Richmond River turning out these
boxes.
#. * * *
“Moana”: “Milo” (B. 11/3/T5) asserts
that a factory at Byron Bay (N.S.W.) is
the only one in the world where a milk by-
product is utilised for the purpose of making
casein. Wrong. At Edendale (M.L.) a
big, modern factory is turning out vast
quantities of sugar of milk as well as the
stuff mentioned by “Milo.” Fortunately for
this factory it doesn t have to de P®“ £
the demand for casein from Hogmany, to
sugar of milk is its long suit and it reaps
rich harvest through the price of tins con
modity having soared owing to tbe ‘
The bluenoses round Edendale don t "a
much. First they make the mffk into
cheese Then they run the whey througn
separators and extract the small percentage
„f cream remaining, and this is made in
butter. Then what is left is piped to £
sugar of milk and casein works, and about
all that escapes from there is aroma.

A pretty London actress, Dorothy Fun-
ston, now playing “The Country Girl” at
Daly’s Theatre, has got damages from a
dentist who exhibited her picture under two
aspects—“ Before” and “After.” The first
showed her glum and toothless, the second
cheerful and with perfect ivorms. The
defence was that there was nothing defama-
tory, but the jury said there was £3O worth.

anything extravagant. #

was a popular passenger ship during the

THE CLIMAX OF HORROR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The market for rabbits was dull, with prices tend-
ing towards easiness. —Market report.
It was a very dreadful night. The thunder boomed
and rolled,
And lightning lit the room as Jones his drab life-
story told.
Smith’s eggs were ageing in his shop, for nothing
had been sold.
I do not know how I escaped, but from that room
I fled
Through hissing sheets of rain that dashed on my
defenceless head ;
My breath was burning in my throat —my wet boots
felt like lead.
A wet policeman ran with me through that terrific
gale;
His nose was ruddy as port wine, but oh ! his face
was pale;
His coat of rubber flapped behind just like a mer-
man’s tail.
He asked me, as we rushed and splashed, what ship
had come to wreck,
And who it was who volunteered to chop away the
deck ?
Before I’d time to answer him he fell and broke his
neck.
I sprinted past the sprawling corpse, and never
turned my head...
Hops when alive don’t int’rest me —I cannot hear
them dead.
I might have asked It, “Are you hurt?’’ but I
rushed on instead.
At last behind the sheets of rain I saw a tall church
loom,
And with the wild, wet, sobbing wind I heard an
organ boom.
I hoped within to hear a Man discourse of death and
doom.
The altar candles burned like stars; the black roof-
shadows hung
Like great extinguishers of stone on mighty cables
swung.
A curate like an ant on end piped with a honeyed
tongue.
The tiny curate squeaked of Hell like any fireside
mouse,
While winds of God pursued their tails around His
mighty house,
And 'midst the pendant shadows organ echoes held
carouse.
The organ music roared and flamed, cascaded, burst
and groaned,
And in the pulpit something white of Hell’s red
gladness moaned ;
It was as if a bee his small opinions telephoned.
Just when for that small curate-thing I’d grown
a splendid hate,
And, shiv’ring, hoped to see it dashed beneath some
shadow-weight,
A drifting shadow thrust beneath my frozen nose —
the plate !!....
Was it only the draught, or did somebody hiss:
“There’s nothing at all about rabbits in this!”
N.S.W.
THE RELIGIOUS EDITOR.
TAKING THE ODDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Amongst those who enlisted yesterday was a V
maker. —News 'ltem.
Tie went with us, but at the Front
His instincts rose once more,.
And in the hail of speeding death
He took the odds of war.
He’d lay the odds on everything;
On every trench we took
And every day’s account of loss
The beggar made his book.
When in a rush upon the foe
A comrade earthward reeled,
He shouted: “Evens he is killed;
And four to one the field.’-’
He gives the odds on shot and shell,
And yells as great bombs fall:
“It’s three to two the next kills five,
And twenties none at all!”
And every time I spot a foe,
And raise my blooming gun,
I hear that raucous voice remark:
“I’m laying two to one!”

for they are numbered among the many children
that were treated with Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy last winter.
You know this is a most marvellous remedy
for coughs, colds, croup, whooping cough,
influenza and bronchitis and I expect to treat
thousands of children with it this winter, and
grown folks too.
Mv advice to you is not to wait until your
children, or you yourself are stricken down by
one of these dreadful complaints but get a
bottle of Chamberlain s Cough Remedy now and
keep it handy. You know the old saying - ™

ANY WOMAN who lacks good bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfedt appear-
ance. Nack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks, and “salt-cellars” quickly take from a woman

ce\ e opment is concerned, but science has found a way to correct your deficiency. Kven though you
iave nevei been full-bosomed, and though you have been attenuated all your life, if you suffer from
/no wasting disease, your bosom can be fully developed and your weight increased to normal.

DR. FARRIERE’S FRESH-POOD is totally
harmless in every respect. Its efficacy is beyond
question, and its use is no demand upon the subject’s
time. Many cases have gained up to six pounds a
week, and an increase in bust measurement up to
eight and ten inches is possible. Flesh-Food offers
relief and development to the thousands of chronically
thin women who have despaired of ever possessing a
presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food-
treatment that adds weight and permanent develop-
ment to attenuated women. Guarantee given in every
case accepted.

POINTS
HIS LATEST ROLE.
In Beilin and Westphalia all kitchen garbage is
collected by the authorities, and some journals sug-
gest that this should be done throughout Germany.
— Cable.
BOTTLE-O B ILL: “Any rags, any bottles, any
bones for the Faderland?"
A Vic. Minister lately proposed a sub-
stantial rise in the screw of a prominent
civil servant. “The man never did any-
thing,” said a plain supporter. “Perlians
not,” answered the Minister. “But remem-
ber how long he has been doing it!”
A total of 12.455 persons were received
into N. S. Wales gaols last year, of whom
0299 got there for non-payment of fines.
Thus more than half were gaoled, not be-
cause they were dangers to society, or in
need of restraint and reformation, but be-
en use. of their poverty; and that half does
not include, apparently, the people who
went in for ordinary debt. The same or a
worse average is reported year after year.
A. civilised, or even a sensible, community
might reasonably be expected to want to
keep its capable workers out of gaols, where
they cost the State f 1 a week each; but
the Law still lias a mania for rushing the
poor into a cell. It will take years to
cure it of the disease; meantime, this coun-
try, being just now too hard up to enter-
tain unnecessary guests, the effects might
at least be modified by the simple device of
giving the prisoner longer to pay his fine.
CONSUL!ING THE BOSS ABOUT IT.
Amsterdam, Wednesday.—The Turkish Council of
Ministers has asked the Sultan to accept the title of
“Ghazi,” or conqueror.— Cable.
The action taken by the Federal Council
of Labor to convert itself into a Federal
Labor Council is something more than a
juggle with words: it is a recognition of the
federal! sation of unionism. The Federal
Council was a body which met annually, as
a rule, but might be specially called together,
and it was composed of delegates elected by
the Labor Councils in each State. The pro-
posal now is to extend its constitution to
allow of the direct affiliation of unions which,
owing to their inter-State character, have lost
interest in the State Councils. If the move-
ment manages to get past the ,State frights
feeling that still lingers amongst some union-
ists, it means placing at the head of affairs
a Federal Council, beside which the State
Councils will presently be small pumpkins.
“The Looker-on” : When I saw the bush-
men -adding past I remembered the adver-
tisement the papers print when squatters
want “married couples” to look after their
sheep and keep the food bills down. I
suppose quite a lot of these sturdy fighting
men were “encumbrances” in the grand old
days ?
The men at Cockatoo Island and else-
where who demand extra pay for working
on holidays to save the Empire ought of
course to be ashamed of themselves; but
they shouldn’t be any more ashamed than
the very fat steamship owners who are
also supposed to be helping to save the
Empire. A statement of the money which
some of these people are getting for the
use of their arks would take the tax-
payers’ breath away if alongside it were
printed another statement showing the
average earnings of the same arks even in
the thriving two years before the war. In
consequence of the blood-money the owners
are extracting from the nation, the charge
for private services has also been pushed
up outrageously; so it probably isn’t too
much to say that, outside one or two mail-
carrying lines, the ocean-going ship is on
the average making twice the money it
was before the Empire was fighting for its
life. Men in the business who have some
scruples left declare that, at the rate some
vessels have bled the nation lately, they
would earn net within two years as much
as they cost.. This is a scandal beside
which the action of workmen in asking an
extra shilling or so a day is a trifling
misbehavior. If it continues there will be
some more Kitchener Socialism presently.
The pathetic wail of an Australian
woman who wants to walk in the path of
patriotism:—
Until the outbreak of the war, from the time these
legs of mine were seven years old, their clothing has
borne the stamp, “Made in Germany.” Now, when
I have abjured the Hun and all his works, and ask
for Australian stockings, the shopwalker loftily re-
marks that if I don't like German goods—“bought
before the war, madam, of course” —he can supply
something very tasteful “from America” ; but as for
Australian-made stockings—well, really, they are not
made here; and, in any case, you know —and so on.
What am I to do about it?
In the great crisis about stockings now
confronting them, the women of Australia
can do great service to the cause of
national industry. They should first sternly
decline to buy, borrow or mend an im-
ported stocking of any kind, and then
decide, according to individual choice,
whether to knit their own stockings,
revive the fashion of the Roman matron
and go without, or take to putties.
When the N.S.W. Government, instead of
building locally the trawlers required for its
“cheap fish” enterprise, hurriedly ordered
the purchase (with p.n.’s) of several craft
in England, the excuse put forward was that
all the arrangements in connection with the
scheme were in a state of great complete-
ness, and any delay in getting the ships
would lead to much embarrassment. Two
of the imported trawlers having now
transpired, it turns out that no arrange-
ments had been made pending their arrival.
The Government didn’t know last week
where the receiving depot was, the manner
of using up by-products had not been deter-
mined, and the problem associated with
establishing a cannery still awaited atten-
tion. “All this,” observed George Black,
who holds the portfolio of Chief Fisherman,
“is in _ the lap of the gods.” It would be
impossible for him to more clearly indict
the Government of having not only broken
a Labor principle, but of having done it
under the cloak of a false pretence.
When Jack Scaddan (W.A.) threw off his
swag and camped at Melbourne the other day
he didn't feel as joyful as usual. The in-
fluenza microbe had managed to get hold of
“Happy” during the long tramp east, and
when he reached the Yarra he decided to
remain in his blankets for a week or so.
Having fixed his mate up comfortably close
to the tea and damper, Tommy Walker, Jack’s
Attorney-General, hoisted Matilda, and was
last heard of making good time towards the
N.S.W. border, heavily weighted with statis-
tics about Westralia’s loans and the losses
on “Happy’s” enterprises. Tommy will,
therefore, be his State’s solitary representa-
tive at the Premiers’ Conference.
A CHANGE OF BRAND.
A little label bearing in very small type, “Made in
Germany,” formerly adorned the packet. Now the words
article, in the same packet, bears the words “Made
in Holland.” —B. 29/4/’15.
DER A RDIST: “ Peaudiful! Und mil der
assistance of der tarn-fool Ausdralian tariff
I vos trade mine surplus sdock mit dot
country."
Wild words by Senator de Lai'gie:—
If therefore. . . .it will be necessary to pass the
Referenda this session.
If any attempt of the sort is made it is as
much doomed as was the last effort made
apart from a general election. There
is only one thing to save it —com-
pulsory voting. And the Liberals could
hardly object to that, as they claimed,
when the Referenda nearly succeeded two
years ago, that the threatened calamity was
due to apathy on the part of those who were
hostile to it.
HOW HE MANAGED IT.
“I quite approve of this temperance movement
— I've cut liquor out of my household."
"Yes, but what do you do when you want a
drink? ”
"Well, you see, I’M living at the Club."
What an utterly busted authority Richard
Ccbden is, to be sure, on commercial ques-
tions ! Consider this :
There is a vague apprehension of danger to our
shores experienced by some writers, who would not
feel safe unless with the assurance that the ports
of England contained shins of war ready at all times
to repel an attempt at invasion. This feeling arises
from a narrow and imperfect knowledge of human
nature.
And it has now been established that the
only thing that saved England from inva-
sion and the British Empire from probable
destruction eight months ago was “a
narrow and imperfect knowledge of human
nature” on the part of Winston Churchill,
which impelled him to mobilise the fleet
before Germany could get busy.
“8.J.”: A few weeks ago I bought a
large wall map of Germany, for which I
paid 15s. The other day I asked for a
similar one of Australia, and the price men-
tioned was 18s. 6d. “Whaffor?” I demanded
in clear, ringing tones, and was told that
there is a 271 per cent, import duty on
Australian maps, while all others are
allowed in free. Apparently it was
thought that the duty would encourage
local map-makers ; but, in view of the lim-
ited local demand, how could even one firm
thrive by manufacturing maps of only one
country, in competition with the cheap
labor of Europe? The reasonable course
would be to place a duty on all imported
maps; and since it will probably be 1927
before the Inter-State Commission reaches
this item. I hereby suggest that the said
duty be imposed at once.
THE HYMN OF ASPHYXI-HATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gott spake the word: “Do thou thy worst.”
We shouted “War!” and got in first;
Unfriendly nations vainly curst
The ultimatum
We thrust upon the Belgians weak
Who braved our might, Gott d —n their cheek!
Our Kultur being quite unique
We murdered babes ; on maidens meek
A holy vengeance did we wreak;
Then started, in a joyous freak,
To mutilate ’em.
Gott said: “Break all the war-time rules
Which Hague Conventions made for fools;
Your learned men from German schools
Repudiate ’em.”
The Allies played the simple game,
Expecting us to do the same ;
But we, who have an end and aim,
By any means will kill and maim.
Let them who thwart us bear the blame.
A right divine we proudly claim
To seize the blind, the halt, the lame
And flagellate ’em.
Our gallant Dreadnoughts float at ease,
Avoiding battle and the breeze.
We scorn the British on the seas—-
Aeh! how we hate ’em.
This order Gott in Himmel gave
To Tirpitz, bravest of the brave:
“Rule thou the unseen underwave.”
Our submarines still play the knave;
The sea-bed is their pirate cave.
What matter though the nations rave?
No merchant crews shall Germans save,
But to a damp and silent grave
Just destinate ’em.
And Gott said: “From the higher air
Drop- bombs on London’s city fair ;
Kill tens of thousands toiling there—
Exterminate 'em.
Give British captives special Hell.
Aye, do your worst, and do it well!
Slaughter the wounded where they fell,
No shocking tales can dead men tell
IVho roam in fields of asphodel.
And if your sulphureted shell,
From guns that boom a parting knell,
The foemen’s spirit cannot quell,
Or stop their forward rush pellmell,
Cast to the wind your floating spell
And kill them with the deadly smell
Of gases which the chemists sell—
Asphyxiate ’em.”

Sing bey ! for the joys of the buffer State !
Sing ho! for its mad delights!
Where murder stalks till the day is late,
And arson illumes the nights.
Where the onlooker suddenly falls apart,
As he’s sliced in two with an axe:
And fires are foddered with works of art
While the dead are burned in stacks.
Where convents burst into sheets of flame,
And Virtue flees for its life;
And burglary’s merely a parlor game,
And torture and rape are rife.
Though no place ever was heard of yet
To match it for thrill and glow,
I find at last, to my great regret,
My nerves are starting to go.
Thev don't quite follow the notion there.
They look on me as a freak.
But I've taken a ticket and paid my-fare,
And I'm off elsewhere next week.

THE “Ensignette” is a tiny, Daylight-loading Camera, made to
take Roll-films. Full-sized postcard pictures can be made
from “Ensignette” negatives by using the special printing
box instead of an ordinary frame. It means that one can produce
full-sized postcard pictures with a camera that slips into the vest
pocket, a camera that .you can carry on every occasion, and one that
will never be in the way. v
. Fhe ‘Ensignette” is built of metal, and measures, when closed,
3sin. x Isin. x ijin. it has a good lens, with adjustable diaphragm
openings F/11, F/16, and • F/22. There is a self-contained,
brilliant view-finder and a new Everset Instantaneous and Time
Shutter.
The No. 2 Model is a little bigger, but it will easily fit the
waistcoat pocket.
An “Ensignette,” which can be stowed away in a tunic pocket
or strapped to a belt, is the one and only camera that is really
strong, easy to load, and useful under all circumstances. Every-
thing else is too big or too bothersome. Besides, the “Ensignette”
is British made.

WHAT DYSPEPTICS SHOULD EAT.
A PHYSICIAN’S ADVICE.
“Indigestion and practically all forms of
stomach trouble are, nine times out of 10.
due to acidity; therefore stomach sufferers
should, whenever possible, avoid eating food
that is acid in its nature, l or which by
chemical action in the stomach develops
acidity. Unfortunately, such a rule elimi-
nates most foods which are pleasant to the
taste as well as those which are rich in
blood, flesh and nerve building properties.
This is the reason why dyspeptics and
stomach sufferers are usually so thin, emaci-
ated and lacking in that vital energy which
can only come from a well-fed body. For
the benefit of those sufferers who have been
obliged to exclude from their diet all starchy,
sweet or fatty food, and are trying to keep
up a miserable existence on gluten products,
I would suggest that you should try a meal
of any food or foods which you may like in
moderate amount, taking immediately after-
wards half a teaspoonful of bisurated mag-
nesia in a little hot or cold water. This
will neutralise any acid which may be pre-
sent, or which may be formed, and instead
of the usual feeling of uneasiness and ful-
ness, you will find that your food agrees
with you perfectly. Bisurated magnesia is
doubtless the best food corrective and antacid
known. It is not a medicine, and has no
direct action on the stomach; but by neu-
tralising the acidity of the food contents,
and thus removing the source of the acid
irritation which inflames the delicate
stomach lining, it does more than could pos-
sibly be done by any drug or medicine. _ As
a physician I believe in the use of medicine
whenever necessary, but I must admit that I
cannot see the sense of dosing an inflamed
and irritated stomach with drugs instead of
getting rid of the acid —the cause of all the
trouble. Get a little bisurated magnesia
from your chemist, eat what you want at
your next meal, take some of the bisurated
magnesia as directed above, and see if I hi
not right.”*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
A fine athlete went to rest when Private
i’om Whyte was killed in action at the Dardanelles.
Inter-State rowing courses knew him well, and his
stroking of several of the S.A. representative shells
earned him admiration amongst men who knew a
sculler when they saw one. In addition to rowing,
he shone at lacrosse, and was one of the best of the
State’s players. #
Adelaide’s fine old sports patron, Edwin
Smith, loses a grandson to the Turks —the first S.
Aus. officer to go down. lie was a son of the old
gentleman’s only son Talbot —one of two of that
family who went to the war.
N. S. Wales Rugby Union is keeping
an honors list upon which are recorded the names
of the men who have buckled on armor for the wars.
Eo far, about 500 names have been inscribed, and
returns have yet to come in from 30 or 40 clubs.
Football got a start in Sydney on Satur-
day ; but, as was to be expected in the circumstances,
there was little dash amongst the players, and about
an equal amount of enthusiasm on the banks where
the wild barracker blows. The Rugby amateurs, who
have steadily horned into the Great Scrum, are this
season not playing for keeps. Competitions may be
said to be off, and club matches of a more or less
desultory nature will be the programme. The Rugby
League, on the other hand, sees no reason why it
should nojt shake as much life into the season as condi-
tions will permit. On this point it lias already
fallen foul of a section of public opinion, and is likely,
to fall foul of more as battle misfortune affects the
people in its vicinity.
A good deal of misguided opinion regarding sport
and the war has been expressed. There is no sound
reason why the fields should be closed while athletes
who are not at the Front—and herds of -them cannot
go to the Front any more than mobs of those who are
yelping at them can go—sit down with long faces and
help to make up a down-liearted congregation. There's
an hour for mourning and an hour , for tears, but
there’s also an hour for bucking-up and belting de-
spondency to leg. ' Another point is that if the
field games are to be robbed of their interest streams
of people will be digressed on Saturday afternoons
into the far less wholesome pubs. Someone asks:
What about the theatres? If the sports, grounds are
denounced as an appeal to the careless or the heart-
less, what about musical comedy arid vaudeville and
the circus? In any case, if the crowds could he
diverted to the theatres the next cry would be “Shut
the theatres!” That would leave tlie pubs, unless the
pubs are to be closed, too. Admitting all as evils
(which The Bulletin does not), the athletic sports
seem the least.
At the same time, the Rugby League would stand in
a better light if it set apart most of its takings, bar
fair expenses, to the Patriotic Funds. The small
amount which it has made up its mind to hand over
from the gate of representative matches, phis a trifle
from individual clubs and officials, is not sufficient to
ward off a charge of playing the game for the boodle
there is in it.
The Rugby Union game should pet a lift
this year into favor hv means of the matches plaved
between a soldiers’ 15 and the district 15 that has
the bye. Last Saturday the Randwick team beat
one from Liverpool camp by 24 points to six points.
It looks worse than it was. Anyhow, Liverpool camp
was primed with excitement. None of the other
four senior games provided scintillating spectacles,
hut the war-weakened teams have not yet recuperated
and got into trim.
*• -X- * *
That football still has a firm grip on
public favor, at least in Melbourne, was shown by
Saturday’s attendances, particularly at South Mel-
bourne, where the locals met Carlton in front of about.
20,000 people. Though the red and whites pulled
up towards the finish, when the blues eased off, they
were never in the hunt, the Northerners being
faster, surer and more systematic. South is relying
too much on proved veterans, who know all the
points, but cannot live alongside well-trained young-
sters. Carlton won by 60 points to 47. St. Kilda,
at Geelong, achieved a. considerable feat in running
the Sleepy Hollow to within two points—s 4 to 56
on the latter’s own ground. ’Wood went to Rich-
mond and handed out an even more frightful wallop-
ing than was administered to Essendon last week, 83
points to 30 being the measure. ’Roy downed Mel-
bourne by 101 points to 56, which was not unex-
pected. #
Only one Vic. Association game promised
excitement, that between North and ’Town, and the
5000 or 6000 spectators got their fill of it. The
teams were level till near the close, when North
rushed a couple of goals and won by 12 points—s 2
to ’Town’s 40.

M. H. Marsh met A. B. Jones in the singles final, and
won 3 —6, 6 —4, 6—4, o—6, 6 —4. This is Marsh’s
first win, and he thus gains a trophy, donated by him-
self as president of the;. Tennis Association and pre-
sented by his wife. glories and. Weight took the
doubles championship, iJones and Miss Stewart the
mixed doubles, and Miss’Stewart the lady’s champion-
ship.. The ladies’ doubles is still undecided, and no
one will drop dead of surprise if Miss Stewart gets
it as well. . A,

For the Adelaide Cup (run on May 10)
a good string of Melbourne horses seems likely to
go across. Last year saw a record field of 27, and
precisely that number stood the final acceptance this
time. Jolly Beggar (9st. 121 b.), Sylvanmore, Bon
Ton and Orvieto head the list. For the Goodwood
six-furlongs, 26 stayed in. Orvieto is in that, too.
lownit has top weight, 9st. 131 b. ; last year’s winner,
Kosai, comes in with a modest Bst. 41b.

Thus Canterbury (M.L.) Times con-
cerning Premier Holman’s (N.S.W.) attitude towards
the tote: —“He was very pronounced in tlie view
that betting was degrading, but though he opposed
the machine not a word fell from him indicative of
desire to banish the parasites who roar the odds
on all racecourses in the metropolitan area. It is
easy enough to understand the attitude of a man who
holds that all betting is immoral, hut it is not easy
to follow the workings of his mind when, after
denouncing the wagering habit, he shows not the
least anxietv that anything effective should be done
to check it.” What! Wasn't he the virtual head
of the Ministry that appointed the Tote Commission,
which was given a tour of Maoriland, among other
places?
Christchurch (M.D.) recently felt cheap
through a rumor getting about that it was going
to lose its pet idol, the mare Warstep, owned by
C. G. Dalgetv, of the Pancake City. Rumor turned
out to be a liar; but the alarm wasn’t quite base-
less. A month ago some sport in Australia cabled
to the owner asking for a price to be placed on
Warstep. Dalgetv replied something about 5000
guineas. Evidently the unspecified gentleman in
Australia fell down dead when he got (he news, for
be hasn’t been heard from since.
So far Warstep has earned £1)280 during
her short career—• £6360 during the present season,
which is Hie largest sum ever bagged by any prad in
one year in Loan Land.
Maoriland speed horses continue to
gallop over Australasian racing records. On top of
Warstep's two-mile record of 3min. 24sec. comes
the effort of Chortle, who reduced the Australasian
lj-mile figures to 2min. 5 l-ssec —one-fifth second
better than Woorak’s effort at Randwick last
October.
Turf nomenclature is a tine art that
owners are i very shy of. The youngsters purchased
at the last yearling sales are now being baptised, and,
so far, little originality has been shown. Most
owners flee to obvious compounds. The Earlston-Lady
San colt lias been named Earlsan; the Mountain
King-Sweetwood colt is Mountwood. The christening
of the son of Comedy King—Key, as Baldpate (“Seven
Keys to Baldpate”), is, beside these, ingenious. So
far, the season hasn’t produced any bookmakers’
horrors such as Pstytyxz, or something like that, under
which a N.S.W. nag staggers.

A. VON
DOUSSA,
Secretary of the
Onkaparinga
Racing Club
(S.A.).
Ilarry Good-
man, one of Maori-
land’s best-known
trainers, weighed
out for the Final
Handicap the other
day after handling
winners and losers
in that country for
4 9 years.; Lo Lou;)
and the great Sir
Modred passed
through his hands,
and when Euroclv-
don won the two
Cups and Derby at
Hiccarton it was
Goodman who lifted
Frank Kingan into
the saddle. Solu-
tion came from
one of Goodman’s
loose boxes to Aus-
tralia to win the
Metropolitan Han-
dicap and miss a
big race at Flem-
ington. The old
man took to horses
shortly after being
born at Adelaide,
68 years ago.
The Turpenite case came to an end in
Hobart last week, when the local P.M. delivered him-
self of an extremely bitter lot of remarks. He said
that he hadn’t the least doubt that Turpenite was
really the mare Harem Skirt, after which the counsel
for the Crown voiced a hearty vote of confidence in
the magistrate’s perception, and intimated that in
his opinion forgery had been committed. The parties
chiefly implicated were a trainer, a bookie’s clerk
and an ex-horseowner. The amount of the stake
was only £35, but in such a case the public, and
not the racing club, would be the mark. Picture the
odds a penciller in the know could lay against the
field if he had it from the stable that one of the
starters was a champion travelling under an alias.
As a prosecution has been promised in connection
with this matter, it is not seemly to say more than
that such mishaps don’t occur under the Tote system.
Although entries are not yet due for the
Melbourne Cup, foolhardy punters are already sugar-
ing the ever-open Bag by backing Wallace Isinglass
for the Derby and Clip double. The animal is
owned by Newcastle coal-baron Brown, and the in-
vested money is alleged to be a “stable” move.

The Australian light-weight wrestling
championship between Shima and McDermott, at
Helensburgh (N.S.W.), ended in a mix-up. Condi-
tions were catch-as-cateh-can, with strangle, full-Nel-
son and toe-holts barred. Three bouts of half an
hour each were resultless ; but in the fourth Shima
upset Mac with an arm and neck holt. The fifth
term had been surging for 22min. when McDermott
forced the Jap. through the ropes, whereupon seconds,
hangers-on and sundry others joined in the mael-
strom. Amid the din, McDermott claimed the match,
and refused to continue; but referee McMillan over-
ruled, and Shima got the swag. A return match
has been arranged to be held in Sydney in the
second week in June.
* * * *
After iong-drawn-out battles the rink
championship has been decided amongst N. S. Wales
bowlers. The final, played on Mosman green, was
between Clayton’s rink, from the Lowlands Club,
Newcastle, and Thorpe’s rink, from the Sydney City
Club. The cards read : —-
L. C.
Colgan, Gilbert, Bell, Clayton 20 ..
Whitehouse, Taft, Anderson, Thorpe .... .. 19
Thus the Northerners won by a point, which is
■ equivalent to a nose. The ensuing cheers and soda
shook the Village.
James W. Coffroth swings his left thus
in San Francisco Bulletin: —“Before I write any
more of world’s champions 1 had better dispose of
Bill Squires, the biggest lemon in ring history. I
handled the worst along with the best of them.
Squires fooled me and all of the wise fellows, for
that matter, because he did not talk. I can truth-
fully state that though I promoted the bout wherein
Tommy Burns put Squires out in a punch, I did not
hear the Australian utter two sentences in all the
time he was preparing for the match. We figured
that a man who did not talk must know that he
‘had something.’ I have no apologies to make for
Squires. The public wanted him, and I brought him
here. When lie was in training everybody said he
was a second Bob Fitzsimmons. And, lo tell the
truth, he did look awfully good. No, I will take that
back about everybody saying Squires was a second
Fitzsimmons; there was one writer, a San Francisco
morning paper man, who, from the moment he first
saw him, said that Squires was a lemon. Squires
received exactly $6060 for taking his punch on the
jaw. Burns got $BOOO, a bet of $5O-00 and a more
or less rightful claim to the world’s heavyweight
championship.” Coffroth doesn't say how much he
got for having Bill's jaw on the premises on that
illustrious occasion.

Peter Newton, old-time boxer, got his
knock-out blow in St. Vincent’s Hospital (Sic.), at
the age of 62, after suffering for some 10 years
from rheumatic gout, lie was a native of Sydney,
and fought his first important match with Frank
Brew in 1872. He won after the 37th round, l’etor
and “Black” Albert fought for two solid hours in
the old Princess’s Theatre just 40 years ago, Newton
having the best of the match, which was stopped by
the police at midnight. Although lie had the
largest amount ever paid for entrance in the old
theatre it is safe to say that Bitton, the promoter,
did not put up more than £6O as prize-money. New-
ton and Larry Foley met at the Athletic Hall,
Bourke-Street, in 1879. It was a memorable match.
The men boxed for 47 rounds, at which stage a police-
inspector stopped the battle.
* * * *
The contest at Sydney Stadium between
Harold Hardwick, ex-amateur champion, and Jeff
Smith, conqueror at different times of both Clabby
and McGooity, was not so much a match as a
massacre. It was a case of Smith first and the
opposition nowhere. At no period of the fight could
one nourish the pleasing delusion that the local
young man had a hope. Perhaps lie is stale; lie has
been boxing’ a lot of late. Perhaps, lie was cowed by
Jeff's tremendous reputation. Anyhow, lie attacked in
a gingerly fashion where a policy of cutting loose,
and banging with both hands, and taking a chance,
and hoping against hope for the best was obviously
the sounder line. And so he was defeated in fully 17
rounds out of 20. Smith confirmed ibis paper in its
previously expressed view regarding his lack of a
punch. Had he possessed such an article Hardwick,
for all his strength and splendid condition (after 15
rounds of hard battling he sat in Jiis corner breath-
ing more gently than the average city man does
after a hurried leap on a tram), would have been
cold meat half-way through the fight. Smith also,
for the first time since he has boxed in Sydney, hit
and held with wearisome persistency. It was the
more irritating in proportion as it was unnecessary.
Both men missed badly—a tribute to each other’s
ability as defensive scrappers. The crowd counted
them out a couple of times, not in any hostile spirit,
but as an indication that it was feeling bored. And
no wonder. It was the dullest of shows. A struggle
between a couple of elderly gentlemen armed with
feather-bolsters could not have been freer from thrill
and incident.

Who would have thought on the his-
toric occasion when Fritz Holland gave Les Darcy a
boxing lesson at Sydney Stadium, and was quite
rightly given the decision, and as a result nearly got
the. building destroyed by an enraged crowd from
Maitland —who would have thought then that in
about a year’s time the N. S. Wales lad would be the
undisputed master of the Yank? Yet so it is. In
Melbourne, on Saturday night, Darcy put it all over
his former conqueror and ended by knocking him out
in the 13th round. Holland is the same game, clever
and experienced boxer as of old. It is Darcy that has
altered. Dave Smith has transformed him, in the
last three months, into an artist whom any high-
placed middleweight in the world would be ‘advised
to side-step.
* * * *
Tammy Burns has been explaining lately
that if be had gone in and hit Brudder Johnson
several good hard swipes at the beginning of that
historic disturbance in Sydney the black would have
turned .yellow and the bacon would have hung in the
white man’s corner. Just so! But as it happened
it wasn’t the clouts the man with the big-
mouth didn’t smite the nigger that decided the thing,
but the lacing administered by Ham to an opponent
who couldn’t hit him once a month. Tamraas ought
to shut his head and sit on it.
The arrival of McGoorty and Dillon will
put life into Australian boxing just where it is
most wanted. The middleweight division badly wants
sorting up, for unless some of this class get their
bearings it looks as if they will find themselves
ancient enough for the old-age pension. Les Darcy,
Jeff Smith and Mick King have been busy not getting
together for quite a long time —so busy, in fact, that
they have all been rushing round to argue the point
with men of inferior ring experience outside their
own weight.
Jimmy Coffey, the American Indian who
came here with a reputation, but hasn’t done much
to justify it, beat Eugene Volaire at the Olympia
(Sydney) Stadium the other night. To put it more
accurately, Volaire was beating Coffey when he
was seized with an attack of furia francese or some-
thing, and began a blind career of fouling, for
which the referee eventually disqualified him. In
justice to the paleface, it may be mentioned that
Coffey’s guard is such that it tends to draw the
enemy’s, body-fire in an illegal direction.

Jimmy Hill beat Wave Geikie for the
featherweight championship of Australia in Brisbane
on Saturday night. ®he winner weighed half a pound
more than his victim. The engagement went the
whole 20 rounds, and the epitaph put on its tomb-
stone was: “Waverley was game, but James knew
too much.”
The recent clash at Timaru (MX.)
between .T. Ladbury (Eng.) and C. Stewart oi
Timaru. for the bantam championship ot I.oun ram
was a disappointing affair. The imported man SCM 1 '
Bst. 51b., and the local one Bst. 41b., so they weie
even enough as far as weight went. But the lot,
lad had no chance. Stewart went down for nine in
the first round, and was finally put to sleep in n
third. This was Ladbury’s first appearance in iou-
land, but he is said to have endured no less than lbu
contests' in the Cold Country, and to have won most
of them,
Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, kept up
its recent boom in athletics by winning the sports
from the rival St. Peter’s very easily. After losing
this event for 13 years out of 15, P.A.C. lias now won
it three years running. There was some all-round
work, one “Prince” winning the high jump and mile,
and another the hundred and steeple ; also, the under-
-10 hundred winner got third in the open event Old-
bovs’ races all went to St. Peter’s, Leslie 11 allmann,
hurdles champion of Australia, doing a beautiful

“Dick” Coombes has been elected presi-
dent of the N.S.IV. Amateur Athletic Association for
the 22nd year. lie is the “old man” in amateur
athletics in the State.
In Sydney premiership cricket last season
29 centuries were scored. W. Bardsley, 140, 126,
115, had the best record. Only four batsmen made
double figures every innings they played. Wall
(Balmain) gathered most wickets —:6S for 747 runs
(average, 10.98), which has only twice been ex-
celled in 21 years. He also bagged most wickets in
a match (14‘for 29—against Middle Harbor). Only
one hat-trick was recorded —.T. Randall, against Cen-
tral Cumberland. O. G. Macartney piled up the
highest aggregate—B24 runs; average, 51.50. This
has been bettered only six times in 19 years. The
highest aggregates in Sydney premiership cricket
since 1893-4 have been scored by V. Trumpet’ (1021
runs; average, 204.20, in 1897-8), and .7. R.
Mackay (1041 runs; average, 104.10, in 1905-6).
The season’s best all-rounder was .1. D. Scott (Peter-
sham) —batting, 307 runs, average 25.68; bowl-
ing, 45 wickets, average 8.60. Batting averages are
on the low side, only eight players getting over 40
runs per innings. Bowling was good: 32 players took
over 20 wickets at an average cost of less than 20.
* * * *
The Westralian cricket season closed
with North Perth on top of the competition table
(32 points); Claremont, second (29); and East
Perth, third (17). West Perth, University, Midland-
Swan and Sub.-Leederville followed in that order.
The feature of the season was the play of Arthur
Christian, the skipper of North Perth. He topped
the aggregate runs (771), headed the averages, made
the most centuries and bagged the greatest number
of wickets (Bft).
* # # »
Bananaland has put up its cricket
shutters with Valley (25 points) taking the premier-
ship from Woolloongabba and University (21 points
each). Toowong seemed to he in the right place at
the tail-end of the list. It played 12 matches, was
defeated in the lot, and scored 6 points.
. * * *
“J.G,”: The only thing I can see that
will brighten up cricket and finish big matches
under the best part of a week would he to make the
batsmen run every time the striker touched a ball.
Then he would cither have to smite hard and go for
his natural, or leave it alone and chance whether it
would bring down the stumps behind him.
Dick Arnst has again retired from the
profession of rowing.
William Peck, an axeman from Tassy,
trimmed up a couple of world’s records in Maori-
land the other day. At Taihape, in the 12in. stand-
ing chop, he finished the job in 23 3-ssec., which is
claimed to be the world’s best. Then, at the Ran-
gataua Axeman’s Carnival, he won the 18in. stand-
ing block chop in 43 3-ssec. This also fractures a
world’s record. At the same meeting two saw ex-
perts, Kennedy and Johansen, in the 18in. two-cut
sawing event, ripped through the work in 88 l-ssec.,
another record for the planet.
The’ South Aus. Motor Cycle Club’s half-
mile road-test was responsible for some high flying.
Thorpe, on an Indian, covered the distance in 26sec.,
equal to 69] m.p.li. ; Cornwell, with a Lewis, left the
half-mile behind in 29 4-ssec.,. and Klose, aided and
abetted by a Douglas, was l-ssec. over the lialf-
minute.

This month, the .‘list, will see the Indiana-
polis (U.S.) “500” motor race whirled off at the
Speedway in that town. It is the richest track race
in the world. Last year the winner, R. Thomas,
covered the 500 miles in 6 hours 3min., and in
prize-money and bonuses lifted £lO,OOO.


What’s Your Chance of Winning a Fight ?
M
Perhaps you’re game, gritty, and of good physique. But still your
chance is mighty small, if you’re up against a skilful boxer.
Just imagine yourself as a skilful boxer —cool, calm and collected —-
using your brains to ‘'draw” your opponent—putting the weight of your
body behind your blows —countering his leads —hitting him where it’s
most effective, until eventually he’s confused and bewildered. You can
then hit him when and where you like.
With such a knowledge you’d have absolute confidence in 3'our ability
to look after yourself. And confidence is three-fourths of winning.
Then, why hesitate to learn the best “moves” of the world’s most famous
boxers, as taught by me?

The Supreme Court in South Aus., in the
course of an alleged trading-witli-the-enemy
case, has been discussing as a side-line an
interesting detail. Britain seems to have
declared war with Germany at 11 p.m. on
August 4. Therefore the whole Empire was
at war after that hour. But that hour
means a time when all Australia is—accord-
ing to its varying longitude—either having-
breakfast or going to business on August 5.
Now, was or was not Australia at war at
midnight—its own midnight, not that of
Greenwich?
“W.A.It.” : The date of the First Trojan
War is lost in antiquity, but there is no
doubt about the date of the East: Trojan
W ar. With the landing of Australian
troops close to tlie site of ancient Troy, and
the strong probability of actual fighting on
the bare plain which is all that is left of
the legend of Helen and Paris and Mene-
laus, that date is 1915. The incursion of
Trooper Billy Kangaroo into ancient history
is the most amazing fact in this war. He
followed Napoleon to Egypt, and soon got
on nodding terms with the Sphinx. Now
lie has hurried to meet Helen. That
complacent lady of the greatest legend in
the world is no doubt eagerly leaning over
the walls of the imperishable city and giv-
ing the glad eye to Trooper Bill. Judging
by her matrimonial record —she had at least
three husbands, and furnished the greatest
society scandal in the ancient world by
eloping with that bright youth Paris —Helen
won’t be offended if Bill does “word” her.

handy, who can and will cure you of your bodily
ailments, and set you on your feet again? That is
the safe, confident kind of feeling you have when
you seek the aid of Margaret Windeyer for relief from
hair and scalp ailments. She is a clever, experi-
enced English woman, who has spent the whole of
her life learning all about hair and scalp troubles, and
so perfect is her thorough, sound, skilled, sensible and
scientific system of hair-culture that she knows from
her long, long experience that there is no case of
falling hair, baldness, dandruff, oily or dry hair,
greyness (mind you, greyness, too) or other hair or
scalp ailment, which she cannot thoroughly and per-
manently cure. And when her treatment has stopped
the falling, banished the dandruff, made your thin,
weak, short, dead, miserable hair grow thick, long,
strong, healthy and beautiful, and brought the lost
color back to every grey thread (no matter how grey
your hair or how long it has been grey), you know
that that is the end of your hair troubles for all time,
because, as the years pass by, your hair cannot go
grey again, for it shall be cured of its greyness.
Nor will your hair do aught but just go on growing
-—growing, growing thicker, longer, healthier and
better month after month. It is far better to seek
the aid of a skilled, experienced hair specialist and
get cured of your hair troubles ONCE AND FOR ALL
than to try this, that and the other thing, and fail so
dismally to do your hair any good.
Consultations are free.
There are private waiting and other rooms for men
folk and for women folk.
Oountrv folk who send a few combings for examina-
tion under the microscope will be written a long-
letter, free of charge, explaining all about their
hair troubles and cost of cure. Enclose Id. stamp for
reply. Margaret-Windeyer’s treatment may be carried
out in your own home if you desire. Her address:

De WITT’S— THE ONLY “PROOF-CURE” FOR
PAINS IN THE BACK
Rheumatism, Lumbago, Stone, Gravel,
and other Kidney & Bladder Troubles.
It seems as though a wave of desolation and destruction is sweep-
ing over the jvhole of Australia. Letters have been received during
the last week from places as far apart as Port Macquarie. N.S.W..
and Fremantle, W.A., as well as hundreds of other smaller towns
and villages in Australia.
Almost every one of these letters asks for
information. Every one of these people writes
asking what is the meaning of these aches
and pains in various parts of the body, which
everybody seems to be suffering from. Other
people are complaining of stiffness of joints
and acute backache, with a nasty taste in the
mouth first thing in the morning, constipa-
tion, puffiuess under the eyes, and a general
feeling of weakness and irritability. In some
cases these pains have become so bad that
they have changed into specific complaints,
such as Rheumatism, Gout, Lumbago,
Sciatica, Cystitis (Inflammation of the Blad-
der), Stone and Gravel. Every one of those
people is the victim of a disease which is
rapidly becoming the curse of the country—
kidney disease.
This fell complaint is carrying on its awful
work in every part of Australia to-day,
and hundreds of people are dying every week
who should be alive and well, if they had only
taken ordinary precautions. Surely the above
is an index as to how serious kidney trouble
is if it is neglected. Finally, it becomes too
late, for kidney disease is often the forerunner
of deadly Bright’s Disease, which, as every-
body knows, is fatal in almost every case.
The greatest and most successful kidney
remedy that has ever been introduced is De
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills. There is a
secret to this wonderful success—the secret
is that these wonderful little pills go right
straight to the very root of the trouble, they
go direct to the kidneys themselves—what is
more, they prove it inside 24 hours—guaran-
teed. And the cost is so small.
A pain “just
as though my
back will
break” means
kidney trouble.

To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind
you must positively get rid of the

pass through the kidneys and the
bladder, and not through the bowels as
most Kidney Pills do. When you see the
Urine change to a muddy bluish color—
a feature which distinguishes De Witt’s
Pills from all others—you know be-
yond all doubt that they have put their
healing touch on the right spot—the
kidneys and the bladder. A wonderful
pill—straight to the kidneys —that is
the reason why De Witt’s give such
amazingly quick relief every time.

every case. Look for that blue color.

This co. is in the pastoral finance business
in the moist Polar end of the South Island
of Maoriland, where cold kills far more
sheep than drought. It is a land where you
are liable to trip over freezing works in the
dark; a land where the returns are so sure
that it isn't difficult to become a squatter
on a small scale if you can satisfy this or
some other co. like it that you know a lot
about stock and have enough money to pay
the commission on a purchase. With a paid
capital of £250.000 and £230,511 of
reserves, this co. has no less than £512,874
out in property advances and £419,454) on
current accounts. The total of these and
all other loans is £970.723. As the co. has
£399,782 of other property, more than two-
thirds of it cash and Stock Exchange in-
vestments, it is plain that it must do a lot
of financing. P>ut it finances, wisely.. Seeing
that the money is nearly all in farming and
live stock securities, which it is. often im-
possible to realise satisfactorily in a
huig’y, it raises by far the greater
part of the money on five-year de-
bentures. That of course doesn’t save it
from the risk of suffering from a general
shrinkage in values, the result possibly of
a fall in meat prices; but there doesn’t seem
much prospect of that. The tendency is
the other way. Still to this paper a further
inflation of Maoriland land values on the
strength of any rise in the value of meat
seems perilous, particularly in view of the
heavy taxation which is inevitably ahead
of all parts of the Empire. As for profits,
this and similar cos. are quite likely to con-
tinue to do very well even during the war.
Europe is hungry for the meat which. their
clients can supply, and by far the biggest
buyers won’t haggle over an eighth : and
what is good for the client is good for the
co. which handles the clients’ produce.

judge for yourself what they are worth)
and £3370 besides, after paying the liabili-
ties. But The Bulletin won’t swear that
you could get £10,082 for the tangible
assets. Nearly half of it is represented by
furniture, plant, fittings and fixtures. ar.l
they are poor things to sell if you have to
sell. There is indifferent security, then, for
the capital. But a wild speculator in these
10s. shares at the market price of about ss.
might fluke a very good return. The capital
is written down to £7OOO, so £7OO a half-
year net profit is equal to 20 p.c. p.a.; and
when assets are written down a bit more,
and costs are reduced (as they no doubt will
be when things straighten themselves out),
there may be sweet pickings for shareholders
who got in at the bottom of the market.
Either that or the debenture-holders will
have put the bailiff in, and the whole thing
will be in the pot.

“Quidam” on an endless topic;—
Re George Blakemore’s recent suggestions for im-
proved mining laws. I can’t see that doing away
with labor conditions would be an advantage. In
fact, his suggested laws would very soon stop mining,
as anyone could hold land for ever on such terms —-
Is. per acre rent and 2s. 6d. per acre per six months
in improvements. Would big English cos. ever let
go of land if they could hold it for a few shillings
per acre? And if a tax is put on profits, how will
that encourage the working of properties? There is
too much of holding areas without working them.
That is the idea we want to discourage, not encour-
age. Take it all round, I think a crowd that now
tackles a show, works it legitimately and gets beaten,
is treated fairly well. I know of one little lot
that spent £BOO or so, and still holds its area after
nine months’ idleness. Also, another that didn’t do
a tap for two years, and then the lessee got two
months to persuade someone else to help him. I
know of another show hung up eight years ago, and
still held. In all these cases the labor conditions
gave a chance of galvanising a quiescent show to
life, or of allowing a more skilled or more affluent
crowd to try to succeed where someone else had
failed. After all, labor conditions are not a cast-
iron feature of the “work it or chuck it” principle
which so clearly distinguishes mining land-tenure from
ordinary land-tenure. Pity is that the same principle
is not applied to all land. Then we wouldn't have
land so dear in an almost uninhabited continent that
most of the few people wandering about can’t gfet
any worth using-. We want to encourage people to
use mining land. Why not, then, give the man or
co. that employs more than the stipulated number
the benefit by granting him automatically a longer
breathing space if he comes to grief, and recognise
expenditure of capital on a lease similarly? Then
the man or co. that employed treble the legal limit,
or spent treble the legal limit of capital, would
automatically acquire a trebly long period in which
to raise further capital, reconstruct, go fishing, or
do any darned thing at all, as compared with the
person or co. that only just observed the legal
requirements.

A Secret that Never Fails to
Grow Hair.”
TOILET TALKS.
DISTRESSING lack of hair will mar
A the most beautiful face, and after all
there is really no need to have poor,or im-
poverished hair if a few common-sense rules
are observed. First of all, hair tonics must
be freshly made in order to obtain the best
results, and thousands of women, and men,
too, are now making up their own lotions
with most satisfactory results. For this
purpose they obtain from the chemist’s one
ounce of boranium and mix this
with i-pint of bay rum. quite a
simple formula, and according to
all accounts remarkably effec-
tive. This simple, home-made
lotion quickly removes all dan-
druff, and creates a growth of
new. healthy hair which will
gladden the heart of any woman.
One word in conclusion. Do
not experiment with your hair,
long suffering though it may be.
Nature will surely revolt if you
continue to subject the hair and
scalp to all kinds of fanci-
ful treatments. Employ a tonic
by all means if such is required,
but, having fyund a satisfactory one, use no
other.
NOW about shampoos. Is it reasonable
to expect that one particular make will
suit everybody? Certainly not. Some folks
have dry and brittle hair, others have tresses
which are excessively greasy. Each requires
a different grade of shampoo, if one is to
obtain the best results. The writer’s notice
was recently brought to a substance called
fHillax. ■which can be obtained from most
I
chemists. It consists of small grannies
which, when mixed with a cup of hot water,
make the most charming mixture imaginable
for shampooing the hair. According to the
quantity used, so the strength is graduated to
suit all conditions. There is one drawback,
however, and that is stallax can only be
obtained in jib. tins, which cost about
half-a-crown, but as this quantity is suffi-
cient to make 25 to 30 shampoos it is
really very economical in the
end. It leaves the hair a little
too wavy and fluffy for some
tastes, but this can always be
avoided by rubbing a little olive
oil on the scalp previous to
its application.
A FEW remarks on face
creams may not be out of
place, and, at the risk of being
put down as a little old-fash-
ioned, my advice on this subject
is to leave well alone. Do not clog
the pores with greasy concoctions
which not only prevent the skin
from performing its proper func-
tions, but usually result in en-
(•enraging a growth of hair on the fact, and
you know very well what that means —disfig-
urement for the rest of your natural clays. If
it is necessary to use an emollient at all, get
some mereolised wax from your chemist and
apply in the usual way. This remarkable
substance seems to absorb the worn and
weatherbeaten outer cuticle, and in a few days’
time the new, healthy skin underneath peeps
forth in all its brilliance, and is, of course,
quite free from imperfection or blemish. (•’!

TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Westralia: If you expected that to be published
you are an incurable optimist. Try to learn some-
thing about drawing. You wouldn’t expect to be a
plumber without learning something of plumbing,
would you? A.M.: Thanks; but the theatrical
caricatures are already attended to.
“J” •' The typical war-prisoner’s tale
grows tiresome. When taken he is always
famished and expectant of death. When
he discovers that he is not to be slaughtered
he is pleased and grateful. Having taken
nourishment he describes the position in his
own lines. The men are sick of the war.
The officers are insufferable. The hardships
are appalling. Cold, hunger and disease are
rife. Profound disappointment inspires the
rank and file inasmuch as Paris was not
taken, as promised, in three months. The
prisoner who speaks at all always talks
stuff like this, and some ass in London
cables it to Australia at great expense, after
which it is starred in the middle pages to
the exclusion, quite possibly, of some really
vital item about (say) a local case of drunk
and disorderly. Every prisoner who desires
to ingratiate himself with his captors
naturally tells them what he thinks they
want to hear. If they seem to yearn for
stories about German inefficiency and lack
of patriotism and courage, he will cheer-
fully deliver the goods whether they are true
or not. The trustworthy man who would
tell the truth whether it was palatable or
not naturally holds his tongue. As a reli-
able guide in regard to what is occurring in
the German army the German prisoner is
about as useful, therefore, as a deaf mute.
But he is much more dangerous, because
he almost certainly deceives some people as
to the size of the job we have in hand.
“Hamer”: It is curious to note how the
reproach about “paid agitators” has lost cur-
rency. In the old days the gibe was scorn-
fully applied to everybody who made him-
self prominent in Labor and union matters.
These days it is only now and again used in
regard to a red-rag orator. Ten years ago,
when its use was common, the strenuous
“paid agitator” who threatened the easy
course of the Tories’ ways was very ill-paid,
if paid at all. The secretary of the F.L.L.
in. Sydney received £l5O a year, and the
chief officer of the Labor Council —the ruling
body of unionism—a similar amount. Three
pounds a week was, in fact, the standard
wage for a union secretary. Some of them
got considerably less. Matters have im-
proved since then. The' secretary of the
Musicians’ Union receives £OOO, and several
bodies give their executive officer £5OO. The
standard is somewhere between £250 and
£800; and the union that gives less than
£4 a week is more or less ashamed of the
fact.
SHIPWRIGHT POINT—TAS.
On the left banks of Huon river
Lay this district of renown,
Where prime apples from its orchards
Are shipped from Hobart Town.
Along the picturesque river shore
Embowered homesteads stand,
With here and there a rustic hut
Quaint relics of the Land.
From the early hour of greyish dawn
Till the sun doth sinketh low
The river shins and sailing crafts
Doth cleareth to and fro.

HIS MASTER’S VOICE’
Announcement.
The Empire calls, not for men alone, but for munitions of war.
The battles of to-day are won as much in the munition factories as on the
fields.
We 'have consequently given over to the National Cause, for the manufac-
ture of much-needed munitions of war, several of our largest “His Master s
Woiicd” factories.
So, therefore, we must crave your indulgence if through this there should
happen to be .a shortage of any of our models.
If your dealer .cannot supply the particular gramophone model you seek, we
would ask you to '.bear with us.
Our operatives are in .the .trenches and on the battleships- our factories aie
at work night and day -producing delicate mechanism for use on tie le o
battle.
Remember that YOU ALSO SERVE who to-day
stand staunch for BRITISH Goods —and BRITISH

at work saving labour and making
money on over 5000 farms scattered
throughout every district of each
Commonwealth State.
The reason for this is the IHC line
provides such a variety of types and
sizes as to enable the farmer to get
just the style and power that will do
most economically the work he needs
done. Not only have 5000 users in
Australia found this to be the case,
but so also have a quarter-of-a-million
other users in all parts of the world.
There is no engine on the market that
is so quickly started—requires so little
attention—does so much work at such
little cost and is so strong and
dependable.
We have an engine for just the work
you want done in one of these types
and sizes:

IN
BANANA LAND
Bananaland, which had solid Protection
in the days before Federation, and thus built
up some sound industries, comes in for the
first order for locomotives for the Trans-
Australian railway. Walkers, of Mary-
borough, have been told to go ahead with
20, half to be delivered at Kalgoorlie and
half at Port Augusta. Martin & Co., of
Gawler (S.A.), submitted the lowest tender,
and are on the spot, as it were; but they
wanted more time and were therefore cut
down to five.
The most remarkable funeral procession
ever seen in Australia proceshed to the
cemetery at Thursday Island the other day.
It didn’t procesh in the ordinary fashion,
certainly, but it got there. Dr. Wassell,
who had been commanding “Thirsty’s” re-
spect for 15 years, had died suddenly; and
practically the wholly weirdly mixed popu-
lation was there in its shirt or without its
shirt to see the last of him. But perhaps
the most amazing feature of it all was that
old hands saw what: they had never seen
before nor ever expected to see —Black
Brother of Australia sobbing.
“Norbell” from Blackall:—
I have just come across from Charleville, pacing
through some of the best pastoral country in
Queensland ; but on the 200-mile track there is
scarcely more grass at present that you’d find in
George-street or Gehenna. The route is dotted with
dead bullocks, dead sheep, dead marines, bones and
petrol tins. Kangaroos, turkeys, emus and galahs are
fairly plentiful, but the few sheep visible are as
poor as Reid’s dry dog. The Barcoo is at its lowest,
and the gauge-posts at the crossings are standing in
dust, yards back from the feeble trickle. Business in
the towns is dead. The shopkeepers lie on then-
counters waiting for the rain to come, much as a city
beerchewer hangs round the 3d. bar waiting for a
springer. Andra Usher’s “little drought” is growing
up.
Bananaland still maintains the two-party
system, but with a difference. The parties
now are the Labor party and its opponents.
The latter consist of a collection of quarrel-
ling bantams. Owing to Denham’s--bad
handling of his party, the “Liberal Leagues”
gradually disbanded, and now candidates, self-
appointed and self-supported, are offering
themselves for slaughter in the following
divisions: Denham Liberals, Country Lib-
erals, National Liberals, Independent Lib-
erals, Appel Liberals or Codlin Moths,
Lackey Liberals, Independent Farmers’
party, and ordinary Independents. Good,
solid borrowers all!
The most hopeless Queensland political
candidate has at least one thing to be thank-
ful for. Eggs are a simply prohibitive price
ia Brisbane just now.
Hugh Macrossan, who was an uncom-
fortable prop of the Denham Government
till recently, now owns that the constitution
of the House of Fossils is a monstrosity and
a reflection on the people, who tolerate it.
But, after all, even that doesn’t go far
enough. It isn’t the constitution that is
wrong. It is the thing’s existence.
Apropos Digby Denham’s proposal to
establish five-year Parliaments, Denham has
been in five Ministries, has been five years
Premier, and won five votes from the “Round
Robiners.” Since he has been in power five
Trusts have entrenched in the State, five of
his followers have deserted, meat is five
pence per half-pound, bread five pence per
loaf, and butter has increased five pence on
normal rates. There are five letters in
Frank and live in Digby, and five in the
name of the seat the Premier is after
(Oxley). And the elections are in the fifth
month of the year. About Ryan’s party—
but there’s 15-2 right off.
Whether Labor will pull off its majority
this election is difficult to forecast, but its
dominance in the metropolitan and subur-
ban area is a certainty. . Merthyr, South
Brisbane and Kurilpa will be lost to the
Liberals, and their prospects in Mary-
borough, Gympie and Mount Morgan are
gloomy.
THE STRIKE.
C HARON: “Hey! You go shiver, or I chuck it. D'ye think I can ferry women and
children across as well as armies? ”
This is the first Queensland State election
for 20 years whereat the bent form and
grizzled locks of A. 11. Barlow have not been
among the select few on Liberal platforms.
As an elecliqn'oering expert, versed in
all the old tricSS, and fertile in new ones,
the Old Hand wals simply unsurpassable.

Villiers Brown, M.L.C., who passed out
a few days ago as the result of a misun-
derstanding with a Toowoomba train, was
a thoroughly" good fellow of incurably Tory
proclivities. He had been storekeeper,
banker and pastoralist in his day—was one
of the founders of the old Northern firm of
Aplin, Brown and Co. —and had represented
Townsville for some years in the Legisla-
tive Assembly. At 72 years he was an
alert, wiry man of winning manners and
spotless integrity.
The Traveller.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She grew from girl to woman grey,
Nor left the place where she was born;
Her lot was toil from day to day—
For this her wedding ring was worn.
If once she dreamed of webs like love,
Her dream had blown with other dust,
As winds the spider-castles move,
And life was fact and love was lust.
The children that her body bore
Were worthy offspring of their sire ;
They loafed and grumbled, brawled and
swore,
Or slept, ale-thick, beside the fire.
She churned and baked and brewed the ale,
Scrubbed floors, nor looked beyond the
town,
Where hung one crazy windmill’s sail
On fields of stubble mapped in brown ;
Beyond the treadmill of her load,
Blank windows of unlifted eyes,
She felt the wonder of a road
That led to alien rainbow skies ;
And sometimes in her patient stare
There lurked the shadow of a laugh,
As though a leashed hope waited there
To start with knapsack and with staff.
They straiked her, corse with tardy ruth,
From knotted hands to swollen feet,
Then paused to marvel at the youth
Which made her face so gay and sweet.
It was as though, by land and sea,
Where radiant birds of venture wing,
Spurning the body’s hostelry,
She had at last gone journeying!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 1, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah,^-
Relatives of officers are, if possible, in-
formed of trouble direct, while wives and
mothers of privates have the news commu-
nicated through the family parson, if there
is one. As a result, women who have men
in the fighting lines now dread the knock of
the sky-pilot only one degree less than a call
from Beelzebub or his foreman Bill.
The King’s representative and his official
half are still going the pace. During the
past few days they attended a skating car-
nival, opened a W.C.T.U. fair—where his
Ex. blandly announced that he wasn’t a
total abstainer, but believed in the Tem-
perance movement —and sat out an orches-
tral concert. To-day he will kick-off at the
big football match in aid of the Patriotic
funds, while her Ladyship is uncorking a
fete in aid of the Belgians.
Lady Goold-Adams has started a Soldiers’
Sock Fund, and already a lot of foot-gloves
and a fair amount of cash have been handed
in. There had been rather a lull in that
particular branch of war industry, but
now one can hardly board a tram without
having a knitting needle inserted in the
drum of one’s ear or thrust into an eye-
ball. But that’s nothing so long as the
boys in the trenches don’t have cold feet.
W. Villiers Brown, M.L.C., who was
badly hurt while trying to board a moving
train at Toowoomba, died on Thursday.
The deadly irony of the thing was that, as
the train was only shunting, and not mov-
ing out to Brisbane, as he thought, there
was no call to take any risks with it.
The local German Hall (or Turnvereinl
still continues on its hospitable way. Of
course, British prisoners interned in Ger-
many are allowed to walk out of the con-
centration camps and spend pleasant social
evenings at the nearest British club; and
could we do less than reciprocate the
courtesy? Knowing how harmless and
kindly the German nation is, it would, in
any case, be an insult to have the place
shut up.
The arrangements for opening the Im-
perial Service Club grow daily nearer to
completion. Treasurer Robertson has
given premises rent free until the war is
over, and now all that remains to be done
is to see about a few improvements with a
hammer and saw and to push in a collec-
tion of furniture. President Whittingham
set a good example by handing over £-5
towards these expenses. By the bye, if
anybody wishes to exasperate Mrs. Little,
the secretary, he or she has merely to hint
that this club is a sort of reformatory for
soldiers. The energetic lady has a boy of
her own at some part of the long Front,
and a suggestion of this kind is calculated
to rouse her to carefully restrained frenzy.
Indeed, even if she didn’t have a son at
the Front such a suggestion would make
her so heated that you could boil a billy of
water on her hat. The club is not a
reformatory; it is a haven of rest and
recreation —a present from Bananaland
citizens to men they are proud of.
The Brisbane Women’s Club got out its
best bib and tucker on Thursday night
to welcome-home its past president, Martha
Burns. She looks very fit and well again,
despite the breakdown that compelled her to
cease nursing wounded soldiers and go cruis-
ing round in search of health. Retailing
some of her experiences she stated that the
proportion of wounded warriors who recover
is amazing and comforting. In the parti-
cular hospital where she was a sister to
the hurt there were 600 from the Marne.
Of these 594 returned to the firing line,
healed.
On Tuesday afternoon the Hamilton
Branch of the Red Cross Society held a
very successful gathering at Mrs. Cecil
Palmer’s pretty home. About 200 of our
Very Naicest rolled up, and played cards
in the name of charity. It’s what the
wowsers call “tainted money,” but you
ought to see the shine it makes when it’s
bringing its load of succor home to the
suffering! There were tea and music and
brightness, and if the boys in khaki were
not spoilt that afternoon —well, I never
saw boys spoilt.
We had a military wedding here one day
last week, when Lieutenant Edward Cos-
tello, who stands 6ft. 3in. in his socks, but
rarely does it in public, was made the happy
possessor of Avon Allan, of Karara.
Lieutenant Costello is a Bananalander.
who, after some practice with the 3rd Light
Horse (Darling Downs), joined the 11th
Light Horse, and is to move out presently
with an axe for somebody who’ll be sorry
he spoke. Chaplains Colonel Cosh and
Captain Gordon did the knot-tying, and
Colonel Grant gave the bride away. Ethel
Allan was the only bridesmaid, Lieutenant
A. S. Nobbs was second-best man, and the
officers of the 11th Light Horse provided
an archway of cutlery.
Grace Wilson, the popular and pretty
matron of Brisbane’s General Hospital, has
discarded her “steady” job and is off to the
war to nurse wounded and sick soldiers.
The drain of war and drought is doing
the seaside resorts round Brisbane no harm.
They are having an unusually protracted
season, and even now, with the autumn well
advanced, you can hear the shrieks of
bathers who, in other and better years,
went further, afield for their annual wash.
Yours affectionately.
AUSTRALIA JANE.
“Itan” : The Hullers and the anti-Hullers
continue to wage war over a cattle-tick
specific. Hull swears by his treatment;
the Stock Department swears at it.
Jealousies are alleged. It would be worth
millions to the State if the treatment is all
that Hull claims. Unbiassed witnesses de-
clare for its virtues; others say the oppo-
site. A sensible Government would deal
with such a situation. Probably that is
why John White is leaving the job for his
successor.
One of the ablest Labor candidates in
Queensland just now is T. L. Jones, who
is opposing Premier Denham. Jones is a
successful business man, a convinced Social-
ist and a keen debater. If he wins he will
bring a hatful of brains into the Asseipbly.
The North isn’t the racketty region it was
in Thaddy O’Kane’s time. Why, at Charters
Towers the other day, a petition was actu-
ally presented to the Mayor praying him to
stop the use of intoxicants at public func-
tions !
Queensland Ministers are a hardy crew.
They are just now bragging about the recent
big increase in railway revenue. They don’t
mention that the so-called increase is mainly
due to the shifting of sheep and cattle in
drought areas—a poor thing to brag about,
and full of future trouble.
Adelaide University promptly replaced
deceased Vice-Chancellor Barlow, LL.D., by
Judge Murray, LL.M. Murray is the first Aus-
tralian-born to hold the' office in South Aus.,
just as he was the first to be made a Judge.
He is a graduate of the local university, with
a Cambridge course added. As The Bulle-
tin has previously remarked, he “has it every
way,” being tall, good-looking and young
(50), with charming manners and heaps of
money. In spite of all which, he is one of
the very few highly-placed South Australians
who would have to pay a Bachelor Tax.

“Billy” Miller, who stepped into the
chasm left in the Australian picture busi-
ness by J. D. Williams, had a theatre in
Gisborne (M.L.) when the club-swinging
and piano-playing cranks were in their
waning glory. One day this telegram burst
upon him: “What will you give me to break
the world’s record for piano-playing in your
theatre Easter week?” Reply: “I will give
you in charge.” That concluded the nego-
tiations.
Something novel in monthly magazines is
the Irvingite, whose first number, price two
shillings, has been published in London.
The idea is to give illustrated instalments of
the career of Henry Irving, or, in the words
of the editor, “a periodical pamphlet devoted
to the records of our greatest actor.” A be-
lated and unpromising project, seeing that
there are already about a dozen books deal-
ing with Irving’s life and times.
From London :
Old Rutland Barrington came out at the Police
Orphanage afternoon and gave the policeman’s song
from “The Pirates of Penzance,” with chorus of real
bobbies. GenCe danced for them, and the whole
show realised £lOOO. Oscar Asche and his wife have
made their first music-hall appearance in a weird onc-
acter that isn’t “Kismet” and yet seems to imitate
it at every turn. Asche gags one enemy, imperson-
ates him, and so gets a chance to kill another —by
throwing him off a house this time. A revival of
Elgar’s “Dream of Gerontius” had Clara Butt as
the Angel—-for the first time. King George made his
first theatre appearance since the war began at a
“School for Scandal” afternoon for the Actors’ Benev-
olent Fund. Tree and Irene Vanbrugh, Fred Terry
and Ainley had the chief parts, but star actors were
crowded into the small ones. Genee took a foot in
the incidental minuet; Irving, Alexander, Bourchier
and Weedon Grossmith walked on in servants’ parts.
Producer, Dion Boucicault; takings, £2300.
“Quill”: Our Austral playwrights are as
unenterprising as the news editors. Here they
are, all of them, piffling about with stuff
that doesn’t matter tuppence to anyone—
the playbuilders grumbling because they
cannot find a market, and the newspapers
chewing their weary political husks with
dull persistence. Meanwhile the Yank-made
play gets away with the local cash, and the
Yank paper shows the world how to reach
the public and hold its ear. Consider two
items of recent Sydney news —one about
a shopgirl drawing the winning horse in a
sweep (first prize £5000), the other about
the housemaid at a pub who found herself
the legatee of £5OO, in consequence of a good
turn done to a boarder sometime in the dis-
tant past. Here you have two splendid
newspaper stories —in Sydney neither got
more than a line or two —and the material
for two plays, with that real heart interest
for which good managers the world over are
feverishly searching. But it’s a - thousand to
one that Australian playwrights will view
both incidents with contemptuous indiffer-
ence as being “beneath their art.” They
don’t know their business. If they did two
brand-new ‘ bellows” would be on the hoard-
ings for next week, and the author requiring
another car.
“Harrison O.”: I recently bestowed my
valued commendation on J. M. Barrie for
having in a volume of plays just issued for
reading adopted the Shaw method of describ-
ing his scenes and characters in a chatty,
amusing .manner. “Mid-Channel” (B.
11/3/T5), shocked to his dear old soul,
shouts, “When a play resembles a novel it
isn’t a play”; though apparently so long as
it resembles a furniture catalogue it is the
real goods. When a play is first staged its
settings are arranged under instructions
from the author, and its characters are given
life by mummers who have the benefit of
the author’s ideas as to what sort of per-
sons they are; but when a play is printed
to be read (and this is the only opportunity
most Australians have of becoming
acquainted with the best dramatic literature
of the day) its author should try to make
its scenes and characters as vivid as they
would be in a theatre. Shaw and Barrie do
not follow the lazy Pinero practice of
addressing two very different audiences in
the same way. Their acting script is couched
in the technical jargon understandable by
actors; but when they issue their plays to
be read they make them readable —which
seems to be a very sensible thing to do. Per-
sonally, if I were buying cow-meat to eat
I should think it of some importance that
it was eatable. If I were buying -it for
shoe-leather, its edibility wouldn’t so much
matter, but I should want other qualities
then.
“Jean Sibi”: “Letusee” (B. 25/3/’l5)
quotes me as saying that “the work of the
decadent Wedekind holds the [German]
theatres with the worst specimens of Wilde’s
work,” and then proceeds to plant his tat-
tered banner on the grave of Oscar and
flourish a bunch of theatrical programmes
in a most threatening manner. If “Letusee”
will refresh his memory on my par., he will
see that his antics are- entirely uncalled for,
inasmuch as I never used the words quoted,
nor did I even mention Wilde as a dramatist,
being particular to refer to him only as the
author of “Dorian Gray.” The sad fact that
“Letusee” has built a par. on a thundering
misrepresentation utterly ruins his argu-
ment and' makes his gushful references to
“Salome” and “La Sainte Courtisane”
merely superfluous noise in a public place.
For his information, however, I might men-
tion that “Salome” was regarded as a
piece d’occasion by Wilde himself, who was
so dissatisfied with his inability to reveal the
tragedy in a Frenchman’s French that he
submitted .the MSS. for revision to two or
three writers, including Adolphe Rette and
the Franco-Yankee, Stuart Merrill, who all
gave up the job in despair. Respecting the
much-admired “La Sainte Courtisane,” it
is described by Wilde’s literary executor,
Robert Ross, as “a fragment,” and is only
an incomplete poetic triviality featuring a
problem which a greater craftsman than
Wilde, Anatole France, treated with a richer
sense of irony in “Thais.” As for the popu-
larity of Wedekind, which “Letusee” tries to
refute, I am supported by Austin Harrison,
an English writer who has lived- years in
Germany, and probably has a wider know-
ledge of the German theatre than “Letusee,”
with all his theatre bills.

BIG BEN

IS
“Big Ben— the clock of the hour”
THE traditional pic-
ture of an alarm
clock is that of a
flimsy looking affair
that either rings like a
fire gong or tinkles while
you sleep on.
And the modern conception
is that of BIG BEN—a watch-
like, sturdy, long-lived sleep-
meter that calls you gradually
but promptly and calls until
you’re wide awake.
Big Ben stands 7 inches tall;
he is mounted in a thin model
case, massive, well poised and
triple plated. His face is frank,
open, easy to read —his keys
large, strong, easy to wind—
his voice clear, sunny, pleasant
to hear. It wakes you just
when you want, and either way
you want —with a continuous
five-minute ring, or with a
half-minute signal every other
minute for all of ten minutes.
Big Ben is made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S.A., by Westclox. His
price is 12/6, postage 1/- extra. If
you cannot find him in your town,
send a money order to the makers’
Australian office, Westclox, cr. King
and Kent Sts., Sydney, They will
have one mailed to you by the
nearest jeweller.

guarantees the excellence and quality.

The Ink Way.
A new name for the journalistic blackleg
—a submarine. ll was used by 1. 11.
Hamer, President of the National (English)
Union of Journalists at Manchester
recently. Hamer was reiterating his pro-
test against the “unprofessional competition
of ministers of religion with professional
journalists.” Submarine is a word that has
been brought into odium by the cowardly use
made of the invisible crawlers. “Our
union,” said Hamer, “means to use its
utmost endeavors to stop submarines of
every kind from preying on our trade.”
The inky way has been in great favor in
Austria. In order to avoid military service
rich youths get themselves appointed war
correspondents. They can thus claim, exemp-
tion from actual fighting, according to law.
Some hard-up Austrian papers have scores
of war correspondents and are having the
time of their life on the monthly fee
charged for a shelter in this new coward’s
castle.

The prize for the quaintest printing shop
on earth might be handed to one on Norfolk
Island run by the headquarters of the
Melanesian Mission. Most of the plant was
rescued from the scrap-heap in Australia
and Maoriland. The staff consists of one
comp., who is also the boss printer and the
bookbinder. Native boys turn the press and
supply the power, but the Compositor
Crusoe does everything else. Of the first
edition of the Prayer Book, running to 305
pages, he has turned off 4000 copies, and of
the second edition, 415 pages. 2000 to date.
The translation of the Old Testament
from Genesis to Esther filled 764 pages,
issued in two volumes. The Holy Scrip-
tures of the Pacific are longer than the
English because they express more primitive
ideas. For example, instead of merely mut-
tering “Hymn 137” when he wants the
brown congregation to sing, the local parson
has to say : “The song which is sung in the
House of God is of the hundreds one, of
the tens three, of the units seven.” How
long it would take a politician to explain
to an audience in Melanesia that he was
going to raise a loan of £22 567.891 to help
develop the great natural resources of the
country the Lord only knows.
“Ipsissima Verba”: If is unusual for a
reporter to be misreported, but that is
what has happened to C. E. W. Bean, Aus-
tralia’s official correspondent with the troops
in Egypt. A Sydney paper clipped from
two Melbourne papers extracts of one of his
communiques without the modifying con-
text, and slapped up its own cross-heads and
sub-heads about the misbehavior of a few of
the soldiers. As an instance of how the
thing was done, the Age used Bean’s own
headings, “Australia’s Fair Fame: A Pass-
ing Cloud.” The Sydney paper ran the two
crossheads into one, and made them read.
“Australia’s Fair Fame a Passing Cloud,”
an entirely different thing.
“Pressbox”: “Dogberry’s” par. (B.
15/4/T5) re the grandeur of suburban beaks
reminds me of Paddy Dwyer, P.M., who
delivers his verdicts in the form of musing
soliloquies. He once asked a reporter why
so little space was given to his ruminations
at Melbourne District Court. “Well, to be
frank,” said the pressman, “we can’t under-
stand you.” “H’m —yes,” said Paddy, “I
see. The fact is I think aloud.” That is
better than thinking silently and speaking
through his whiskers, in the nerve-straining
manner of Cullen. C.J., when deliver-
ing an important N.S.W. Supreme Court
judgment. Judge Hickman Molesworth.
now dead, had a cherubic smile and
a trick of winking at anyone on
whom his eye rested while making
his points. On one occasion lie so mes-
merised Tommy Kelynack, of Melbourne
Herald, by this process, that Tommy
winked appreciatively back, and trembled on
the bririk of a committal for contempt of
court. When Bill Wilks was in the House
of Reps, his most irritating habit was to
look up to the Press Gallery at the end of
every sentence he regarded as striking. The
only visible effect was that the reporters
downed tools until Wilks was silent. The
cruellest thing in press neglect was done by
the Argus some six years ago. on the occa-
sion of a speech by King O’Malley which
occupied 235 minute’s. The paper gave it one
line —“Mr. King O’Malley then spoke for
four hours.”
“11.W.M.”: Among the many things for
which Kaiser Bill will be answerable to pos-
terity will be a tangled c op of war poets.
Recently our baker lost his job ; but, being
a versatile man he slipped into poetry, and
hawked the batch to all his late customers
at Id. per loaf. Have a slice: —
WAKE UP! ME.NT OF ENGLAND.
Men of England, be not lured by the freedom that
is yours.
There’s no mistaking the toasting ’neath their walls,
“To the day” your blood, your children’s blood, till
the blood of England pours
To the River Thames, and the Rhine watch be sung
at St. Paul’s.
Men of British Empire, again we cry “Arouse,”
A demon’s thirst for British blood is unslaked.
Our only reply to a serpent on such a low carouse
Is up, then, like true men, your nation’s life is
staked.
TRUFFLE HUNTERS.
(One sub-editor to another .)
[Fok The Bulletin.]
Like an old hog that roots for truffles, he
Sits at his desk and noses out the pars ;
The papers rustle and his hand I see
Slashing green ink in mighty isobars.
No jeer of mine his glum composure ruffles;
He is a wise old hog out hunting truffles.
Stuck in his sty he tumbles with his snout
The tine rich things that wide Australia sends;
Yet he himself may never once go out
To see just how an alligator bends,
Or niggers dance, or fish-stung men go grey.
Such wild and curious things he “subs” all day.
While carters curse, above the engine’s cough,
1 hear him snuffling in his feeding-trough.
“Root hog or die!” is hard on hogs scot-free.
It’s Hell on indoor hogs like him and me!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Mother’s Favorite.
Foolish mothers dose their babies with home-made concoctions or
something recommended by a neighbor, and perhaps upset the little
stomach and make the baby cross and uncomfortable by this mistaken
economy. Wise mothers do not experiment with untried nostrums, but
depend on a remedy which has been compiled from the scientific pre-
scription of a famous physician, and is designed to cure the cold without
upsetting the digestive organs. Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is this
remedy, and mothers may give it to their babies, secure in the know-
ledge that coughs and colds will no longer rack the little bodies.
Good for all the Family.
For Croup it has the most wonderful results. Whooping Cough is cut short
by (he nse of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery. For all the family ills resulting
from throat, chest or lung complaint, the mother’s resource is Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery.

A Matter of Stars, Cold Tea
and a Gentlemanly God.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Ariadne took to drink
Beside the blue sea,
The large sun, with a golden wink,
Marked that her jar was labelled TEA ;
And this, as certain people think,
Increased her sin amazingly.
And yet she dried her gentle tears
With some large bunches of her hair,
Because in those most simple years
People had nothing much to wear
Except the pink upon their ears
And wrappings of delightful air.
She set the beaker to her lip,
A beaker of artistic style,
And felt the cheerful liquid drip
Through the red opening in her smile;
The lady may have made a slip—
The ancients thought her lapse worth while.
The sun sank westward in the deep
And filled the world with gold and fire ;
The hooded night began to reap
The last bright sheaves of day’s desire.
One shepherd mustered three pale sheep
And soothed their slumbers with his lyre
The lady did not heed such things.
The wine was singing in her blood ;
Her soul had grown wide, feathered wings.
She felt the skies begin to bud
And bloom with star-imaginings
Over the purple darkening flood.
Then strode across the warm, sweet night
A person of a pleasant mien—•
A careless gentleman and white,
Whose brows were chapleted with green ;
He wore his eyes as large and bright
As planets when the moon is lean.
The lady offered him a drink,
Which seemed the proper thing to do;
No kind god-gentleman would think
Of scorning liquid full in view,
Because before the birth of ink
Wine was the noblest thing that grew.
lie drained the ruddy beaker dry
And sat beside her on a stone,
Then as the lady paused to sigh
He set his red lips on her own—
Unless some ancient poets lie,
They were the nicest he had known.
lie lifted up a lazy arm ;
His fingers gripped Heaven’s golden bars.
The small celestials in alarm
Fled earthward in their silver cars.
But, careless of their blame or harm,
He dragged away a bunch of stars.
He set them as a diadem
On Ariadne’s shining head.
The young rays streaming out from them
(flowed on the wine-cup rosy red;
Clustering upon their woman stem
They lighted moths and things to bed.
And there the god and lady stayed
Until the happy sun arose.
The morning waves came in and played
With that bright island’s purple toes;
And when the evening cast a shade
The lovers still were nose to nose.
Twas happy, in that golden time,
They needed nothing then to eat.
Their only garments were the clime,
The wine they drank was red and sweet;
Fife was one modulated rhyme
That tripped on endless, lazy feet.
I wish that I could go and sit
In some nice place above the tide.
And find a large, white shade to fit
The shelf of freestone at my side,
The while I wore some stars that lit
The darkening landscape far and wide.
Perhaps if I should take to drink
And nurse a bottle on my knee,
Nor worry if the sun should wink
Because the thing was labelled TEA,
Some nice, god-gentleman might think
It worth his while to come to me.
N.s.w.
MARY McCOMMONWEALTH.
My Lawsuit.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS annoyed to learn from the groom
that he had taken out the sulky, during my
absence in town, and had accidentally
knocked down an old lady. I was panic-
stricken when there arrived, a week or so
later, a solicitor’s letter demanding, in cour-
teous but firm terms, reparation for the
mental and physical damage incurred by
the victim. I showed the letter to a friend,
and his verdict was gloomy. “A danger-
ous little swine,” he said, referring to the
solicitor. “Your best hope lies in her being
a reputable woman with a certain amount
of means. In that case, she will be satis-
fied with a fair thing—say, fifty.”
It transpired, in due course, that she was
poor but honest; that a doctor had given
her a certificate saying she really was in-
jured ; and that she wanted £5OO.
The groom reeled when I told him the
sum for which I had been made liable by
his negligence. lie claimed that he had
been driving slowly, and on the right side
of the road, that the woman was unsober
at the time of the mishap, and that he was
blameless.
Distracted, I sought a solicitor. Most
people have someone whom they refer to,
lightly, as “my solicitor.” I possessed no
such luxury. On the advice of a neighbor
I went to a youngish man, who, as my friend
put it, was “beginning his career,” and
hence would have plenty of time to attend
to my trouble. He was small and resolute
and intensely busy, and he sat in a tiny
office surrounded by one clerk. When I
entered, the clerk was reading a portion of
the morning paper in the ball, and his
master was to be seen reading the other part
in the office beyond. After waiting about
ten minutes I was ushered into the pre-
sence, and asked, absently, to be seated,
while the solicitor wrestled with a mass of
legal matter. The newspaper had appar-
ently been concealed. Looking up, after a
while, with a work harassed expression of
countenance, he said to his henchman or
A.D.C.: “I have decided to let that Mcßil-
lion trust matter stand over for the pre-
sent. Go carefully through the papers in
Haggis v. the State of Victoria. I may
suggest to counsel the advisability of going
on to the Privy Council. I shall see the
parties in Bunce v. Gonce at 3 p.m. Kindly
telephone them to that effect.” The menial
withdrew reverently, and I was left to lay
my difficulty before the expert.
It might be thought that, in view of the
comparative paltriness of the affair, he
would show a lack of interest. Not so. He
was as absorbed as though I had been one
of the millionaire clients to whom he
appeared to be habituated. His opinion,
delivered after I had told him the groom’s
story, was cheering. “From all I can see,”
he said, “it’s a flagrant try-on—just the sort
of case that scoundrel Bustumme would get
mixed up in.” lie then explained bitterly
that Bustumme was a speculative attorney
—an outcast and an object of abhorrence.
I gathered that a speculative attorney was
a species of legal scab. He cut the Union
rates for law work. It was Bustumme’s
practice, where his client was poor, to take
up the case on the understanding that if he
won the suit he got paid, and a bit over for
the risk, Avliile if he lost he got nothing.
The honest solicitor, I was given to under-
stand, prided himself on the fact that lie
got paid no matter liow rotten his advice
turned out to be.
Gradfleck, my own adviser, left me in no
doubt as to his professional standing, lie
explained that he would need a cheque at
once for out-of-pocket expenses and prelim-
inary fees to counsel. I had not a form
with me, so he produced one of his own, and
mentioned that I could alter the name of
the bank, and so on. I saw quickly that I
was dealing with one of the superior mem-
bers of the profession—an attorney to whom
the application of the reproach “speculative”
would be not merely a misnomer, but an
absurdity.
I have never forgotten, in all the years
that have passed, the whole-souled devotion
with which Gradfleck hurled himself into my
little unpleasantness. The Mcßillions and
the Bunces, and so on, were thrust aside
as though they had never been. At least, I
assume they were, since I heard no more
about them. He was ready to consult with
me by day or by night. He journeyed per-
sonally to the scene of the accident, and
examined the scenery, and interviewed the
neighbors. In this way I came in touch
with James Ilipstitch, who had seen the
mishap from his garden; and I learned of
the existence of Daniel Mclnerney, who was
reported to have said, at the time, that “if
his wife was as drunk as her” (meaning
the injured lady) “lie would belt the life
out of her.” Another authority, /however,
the local barman, averred that Mclnerney’s
fury was directed against my groom, for
running over a sober and respectable woman.
In any event, Mclnerney had left for Ireland
a few days after the accident. The evidence
of James Ilipstitch appeared to be wholly
in our favor. However, he was cautious.
Speaking to Gradfleck privately, and as man
to man, over a friendly beer, he said that
the injured woman was blind drunk and
reeling towards a public-house at the moment
of impact. Pressed to sign a statement he
objected that he had never been mixed up
in a law-case —in fact, had never entered a
court in his life —that he was a respectable
man, who had his good name to consider,
and that he was disinclined, in any event, to
be a party to depriving a possibly estimable
and ill-used lady of her just dues.
“I have sucked him dry,” said my adviser
after about a week, most of which seemed to
have been spent in bars with Ilipstitch. “It
now remains to work up our case in other
directions.”
He decided that Mrs. McCleer, the plain-
tiff, would have to be watched. I asked
why? He answered that it was the usual
thing, and that it might lead to important
disclosures as to her habits of life. I gath-
ered that he suspected her of something—
coining, shop-lifting, dipsomania, or what
not. When I got to know him better I
found that there was no significance in this.
Suspicion was, with him, a habit of mind.
He instinctively suspected all who were
associated with the other side. Despite my
protests he elected, generously, to do the
watching himself, partly, he told me, because
the ordinary private detective does not bring
sufficient mentality to bear on these delicate
jobs, partly because he had nothing much to
do in the evenings, anyhow. On the first
night he watched resultlessly from 7 p.m. till
11, outside Mrs. McCleer’s cottage in Buffer
Terrace, Kitchener-road, Five Dock, and then
learned from a passing policeman that the
lady was spending the night with relatives
in Manly. The policeman happened to be
her nephew. On the next night his quarry
emerged about 8 p.m., and went south. He
followed closely, though hampered by the
press of Friday-night shoppers. After some
hours spent in the making of various pur-
chases she started homewards carrying a
broom, some hat materials, a bag of fruit,
groceries of different sorts, and a brown-
paper parcel which she had called for at a
sweet-shop. By the exercise of a good deal
of ingenuity he managed to bump into her,
his object being to knock the brown-paper
burden out of her hand. He succeeded at
the second attempt, at the same time almost
dashing her under a tram. The suspected
parcel proved to contain a piece of steak,
and as he handed it back to her she said,
infuriatedly, that if there was a constable
about she would give him in charge. He had
not been watching for more than five minutes
on the third night when two men—a son of
Mrs. McCleer and her policeman-nephew—
came out and threatened him with personal
violence, unless he went away. Small results

A golden rule for every home
is Keep Zam-Buk Always
Handy. Don’t run risks by
depending upon common
ointments and salves, the
coarseness of which is a posi-
tive danger. There is only
one Zam-Buk, and it is sold
by all chemists and stores
at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot.
DAILY MISHAPS
K\W
MAKE ZAM-BUK A DAILY NEED.
ACCIDENTS will happen in the best-regulated
families. Healthy youngsters seem to be
always “in the wars.” Housework abounds
with mishaps for busy wives and harassed mothers;
and the bread-winner often returns from work
with a more or less serious injury. Just what
every home needs is Zam-Buk. A pot and a
bandage on a handy shelf, where they are handy
for instant use, save untold pain, time and money.
When the little one runs in from his play with
a wry face, and smarting, dirt-filled scrape on his
knee, simply wash the part and smear with Zam-
Buk. When father cuts or scrapes his hand, the
handy pot of Zam-Buk again meets the emergency,
and the housewife or mother continually finds it
a real friend foi* the burns she receives while cook-
ing, the scalds of a washing day, or the knocks,
etc., of dusting. Children like Zam-Buk because
it is cooling, soothing and pleasant, Their elders
value it still more highly because it is also anti-
septic and a powerful germicide, preventing poison-
ing, festering, and disease; because it is a natural
skin repairer, and because it is good for the
tenderest skin. Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk a
daily need—therefore, keep Zam-Buk handy.
MAN’S POISONED
HAND HEALED.
Mr. J. Vaughan, of 14
Sorrie Street, Balmain,
Sydney, says:—“I sustained a
severe knock on the back of my
left hand. Some dirt got into
the wound, causing my hand to
swell and inflammation to set
in. The pain was terrible.
Being recommended to try Zam-
Buk, I obtained a supply, and,
after bathing the wound, applied
this balm twice daily. In this
way blood-poison was averted,
the inflammation was allayed,,
and the pain arrested. Now
my hand is well once again.”

Mrs. G. Green, of 57
Thomas Street, Camper-
down, Sydney, says“My
little son John upset a kettle of
boiling water over himself, and
was nearly scalded to death.
The flesh presented a red, raw
appearance. We all expected
he would succumb to the fear-
ful injuries, and it is a miracle
that he is alive to-day. For
nine months he was in terrible
agony. The sores from the
scald would not heal. After
being attended to at the hospi-
tal, the doctor recommended a
home treatment of Zam-Buk.
We purchased a supply and con-
tinued with Zam-Buk until the
wounds were completely healed.’’

Anaemia
Frequently Unrecognised
The Importance of its Detection
The Symptoms of Anaemia (Poorness
of Blood) are Difficulty of Breathing, Lack of
Energy, Depression, Pallor, and Exhaustion after
Slight Exertion. Many people fail to recognise
these symptoms of Anaemia— the disease creeps
on, obtains a firm grip of the system and eventually
becomes chronic. If the symptoms are recognised
at the beginning it is a very simple matter to enrich
the blood and so effectually check the disease.
roR Je Hoids
enrich the blood—renew vitality
After taking Iron ‘Jelloids,’ the blood becomes
enriched and strengthened, the distressing symptoms of
Anaemia quickly disappear, giving place to a state of
vigorous health and buoyant spirits.
DR. ANDREW WILSON wrote :—“ It can be definitely stated
“ that Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ constitute the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”

for much trouble and anxiety; but, as be
said, we bad at least established that the
plaintiff was surrounded by violent people
who would stick at little.
He chose, as my counsel, his cousin, whom
be termed “one of our rising juniors,” and
his step-father, “the acknowledged leader of
our Bar.” The junior did the work; the
leader supplied the optimism and the con-
versation. After hearing the K.C.’s opinion
of Mrs. McCleer’s chances, I felt genuinely
sorry for that misguided female. It seemed
she was a Dupe, also a Pawn and a Play-
thing in the hands of conscienceless money-
grabbers—persons who should not be associ-
ated with a profession frequented by high-
minded gentlemen. Her case was hopeless ;
her attorney a rogue; her counsel a vaga-
bond. My junior was less encouraging. He
was a depressed, bilious-looking man with
dirty hands and a general appearance of hav-
ing just emerged from a dust-storm. He
tempered the lire of his leader’s enthusiasm
with gloomy remarks, such as, “When Bus-
tumme goes into a thing there's something
behind it.” Mark my words, they’ve got
something up their sleeves,” and so on. A
Lawsuit resembles Life, inasmuch as in its
beginnings it should be all optimism. A
carping word, a breath of thoughtless criti-
cism, may visit the tender growth with
Death in the form of a pusillanimous settle-
ment. I began dimly to understand, while
listening to my insanitary adviser, the
reasons for the unpopularity of people like
(’assandra and Solomon Eagle. One day
when his depressing innuendoes had become
unendurable, I called-on Gradfleck. and said
frankly that I was ill at ease. He viewed
me with disfavor: “Have I neglected your
suit in any way?” he inquired coldly. I was
bound to admit that he had not. On the
contrary. “Do you doubt the capacity of
counsel, or myself, to handle the matter?”
Having repudiated this idea, I disclosed what
was in my mind. Why should I not go per-
sonally to Mrs. MeCleer, admit that she may
have been inconvenienced by the carelessness
of my employee, and suggest the payment of
a moderate sum —say, £lO0 —in full liquida-
tion of her claims?
Gradfleck leant back in his chair and
laughed the mirthless laugh of one who is
obliged to humor an imbecile. “My dear sir ;
my dear sir,” he said protestingly, and then,
after a pause: “I often think how hopelessly
you laymen would fall in if you attempted to
manage these affairs on our own account.
Apart from the fact that such a step as you
propose would be grossly irregular, it would
also be fatal. I say fatal. It is the very
move that they are manoeuvring for. Throw
up the case, pay the £5OO and Bustumme’s
costs if you will —but the other No, a thou-
sand times No.”
The next day I attended a conference,
mainly to discuss our evidence. James Hip-
stitch had shown a tendency to qualify his
original remarks. He now denied that he
had ever said that Mrs. MeCleer was drunk.
As a matter of fact, he didn’t mind admit-
ting that he had had a few himself that
day. Was asked to leave the bar of the
Iloyal. No, not thrown out, simply asked
civilly to get out, which he did like a gentle-
man. Was unwilling to enter the box for
many reasons. For one thing his past
character. When he said, previously, that
lie had not been in court he was slightly
misrepresenting matters. He had been in-
volved in one or two cases of drunk and
disorderly, and also in an assault matter, in
the course of which he had been threatened
with a committal for perjury.
By the time Hipstitcli’s story was told
my junior counsel was almost cheerful. His
illustrious relative’s chronic smile had, on
the contrary, worn off. He expressed the
view that Hipstitch was a liar and a gaol-
bird, and as such a menace to the side that
called him. “Anyhow,” he remarked some-
what irrelevantly, “the other side won’t
dare to put him in the box. Now how about
this man Maguire?” By Maguire he meant
Mclnerney. He was corrected and told
that this witness was in Ireland. “Wliat
of it?” he asked. “Examine him on com-
mission. Nothing easier.” I listened in a
stunned condition, while they discussed the
advisability of applying to the Supreme
Court for a Commission to examine
Mclnerney, and, if necessary, other wit-
nesses, in Dublin. That is to say, a special
Court was to be constituted on the other
side of the world on the off-chance that this
doubtful wanderer might have something to
say in. our favor. The fact that no one
knew in wliat part of Ireland Mclnerney
was, and that he would, accordingly, have
to be searched for by the police or private
detectives, complicated matters still fur-
ther. Mv advisers, however, were unap-
palled. I longed to rise suddenly and howl
at them that it was my money that was at
stake, but lacked the moral courage. I felt
like one who sees his home being burgled,
but is unable to make any sound. In brief,
I was beginning to entertain doubts.
The K.C. remained as genial and irre-
sponsible as ever. But he persisted in call-
ing Mclnerney “O’Brien” or “Murphy” and
Hipstitch “Smith” or “Whatsisname,” and
in other ways he showed that he had not
attempted to master the details of the case.
My solicitor had lost much of his old resi-
liency and dash, though he was still resolved
to carry the thing through to the bitter
end, “if necessary,” he used to say, throw-
ing his head back and resolutely striking
his desk. “to.the High Court and on to the
Privy Council itself. It is a matter of
principle.” And through it all the haggard
junior seemed to get dustier and drearier
than ever.
It was a great moment for him when he
burst into one of our numerous conferences
(at five guineas a time for the K.C. and
three for himself) and said: “Well, there’s
no need to worry about; that Commission to
Ireland. The other side are applving for it
themselves.” “What!” I cried weakly.
1 They regard Mclnerney as a good witness
for them?” “Invaluable.” he said. “I have
just been talking to Clegg’s greatest friend.”
(Clegg was the disreputable barrister who
had been retained for Mrs. MeCleer.) He
learned a few days later from the same
source that Bustumme possessed the signed
statements of several citizens of repute who
had seen the accident from their villa win-
dows, and that their testimony was damn-
ing. And a day or so after lie stopped me
in the street and mentioned gleefully—if
such a term can be applied to one who
habitually resembled an ill-washed mute —
that Mrs. McCleer had backers who were
prepared to see her “to the highest Courts
of Appeal in the Empire.’' On hearing this
I said: “Will you be frank with me? Things
appear to be getting worse and worse. Have
I any hope of winning at all?” Always,
on such occasions, he retreated into his pro-
fessional armor. I fancy, though he liked
annoying and worrying people much, he
liked his fees even better, lie assured me
earnestly that I had a very fair fighting
chance, and that he merely mentioned cer-
tain doubtful aspects of the case in order
that I should be on my guard.
My courage broke down finally when the
time drew near to “deliver briefs.” This is
one of the solemn moments of a lawsuit.
It is, in many instances, the financial
Rubicon, whose passage may mean either
affluence or insolvency. When briefs are
delivered counsel proceed to “mark them.”
The general engagement begins. Previous
payments become, by comparison, mere
affairs of outposts. I learned this from
an embittered ex-litigant whom I met
casually at lunch. It decided me on a step
which I had for some time been contem-
plating.
1 was extremely nervous on the night
when, directly against the expressed wishes
of my legal advisers, and without their know-
ledge, I went forth to interview Mrs. McCleer
in her humble Five Dock home. She opened
the door herself. A faint aroma suggestive
of a distant brewery accompanied her. Her
manner was friendly, almost affectionate, and
Jj ei ‘ speech fluent to the point of garrulity.
‘‘Sit right down, Mister,” she said pleasantly.
‘I suppose yer come about that there accident
matter what ’as bin a curse an’ an unpleas-
antness to all concerned fer weeks past, and
never would ’av’ been entered into by me
and fambly but for Mr. Bustumme ’earin’ of
the occurrence and callin’ to point out that
you ’avin’ money would never fight, but
would be bound to settle up something ’and-
some to escape trouble and further expense—
’e to take ’arf the proceeds and us to get a
tidy bit to go on with. And now ’ere we
are landed in a lawsoot, and what’s to come
of it all but shame and misery and
our pictures in the papers and questionings
by Judges and lawyers in a Court of Law.
Cord on’y knows. What about a taste of
somethin’?” I drank some beer and she con-
tinued, with a hint of tears in her voice :
“And now my son ’ears from reliable sources,
in fack, from the police themselves, that the
lawyers ’ave got all sorts of people to swear
I was in likker and blast me character before
the world and drag me to England to fight
the case there, and rooin the lot of us ; such
is the power of gold.” She hiccoughed twice
and burst into convulsive sobs. Was this
the coldly resolute woman of affairs that
Gradfleck had pictured for me, the female
Shylock doggedly determined to have her
monetary pound of flesh? I found it hard
to believe my ears. “You misunderstand
the position, Mrs. McCleer,” I said earnestly.
“I have no wish to quarrel, no wish but to
see Justice done —that is, in reason.” “Jus-
tice,” she repeated wildly, and laughed the
wild laugh of one who is not strictly sober.
“Where is yer Justice in rakin’ up the parst
mistakes of famblvs, after running people
down in sulkies, to use against them in
courts of law when the payment of a trifling
sum would at any time see all ’appy and con-
tented as in the oarst and wrongs and in-
sults suffered forgiven and forgotten as
though they ’ad never bin. Where is the
Justice”
I checked her with a firm gesture. “Mrs.
McCleer,” I said, “let us end this unfortunate
affair between ourselves here and now.
Name the minimum sum which yon are pre-
pared to take, and I will see if I can accom-
modate you.”
“Well, I don’t suppose 20 quid ’ud hurt
yer?” she inquired.
I retained just sufficient presence of mind
to say. “Make it 10.”
“Will yer spring 15?” she asked.
And on that basis the matter was ad-
justed.
Gradfleck’s face when I told him of my
performance next morning resembled that of
a father who must smile, though he knows
that his best-loved child has i erished. He
regretted the irregularity of my conduct, but
excused it on the ground flint laymen couldn’t
be expected to know the proper line of action
in such circumstances. He said that I should
have his final account within a few days, and
I left him alone with his grief. The account
arrived next day. Exclusive of the £l5 paid
to Mrs. McCleer my lesson in the unwisdom
of going to law cost me £S4 10s. I have
always considered it cheap at the price.

The
Importance
Of
Efficient
Insulation!
The importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If vou strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall’s
Coverings are fully borne out by actual test, -and, further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
NjfW. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims; The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
