- SUFFERING FROM
BRAIN & NERVE EXHAUSTION,
Any man who in hi? youth has trifled away his vigour
of body, mind, and manhood, should consult PRO-
FESSOR CARL STINKAVAY, the. Eminent Sped list,
in diseases of tlie Genito-Urinary Organs, who is still
treating with the gicatest skill and succcsi all Private,
Nervous, and Clironic Diseases.
Professor STINBWAY’S great success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts : - Ist. That every ease treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines and Electiic
Appliances used are exactly adapted to suit the case,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I SEEK CASES WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, Ac., can
recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in / erson or by letter, which is free).
Professor CARL STINEWAY, who has restored
thousands of sufferers to vigorous manhood
after an other treatment had faded. It makes
no difference what you have taken, or who has
failed to cure you. Cases that / accept for treat-
ment are quickly and permanently cured,
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the pow uof will and action? Are
you subject to loss of memory; have spells of faint-
ing ; fullness of blood n the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful, with your mind continually dwelling
on the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation of
the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, wiry further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single
consultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed
on the way to health strength, aiid vigour?

Registered by the Medical Board of N.S.W. ; Late
House Surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital, London.
Specialist for the Treatment of Diseases
OF THE
Reproductive Organs and Nervous Complaints,
WHY I ADVERTISE.
I advertise because I consider it necessary that people
suffering from Nervous, Sexual and Chronic Complaints,
should be able to ascertain which
DULY-QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS
make these Diseases a speciality, particularly as, under
the present law, any person can call himself Doctor 01
Professor, whether ho is entitled to do so or not; and these
persons exist, chiefly, because Duly Qualified Prac-
titioners have not occupied the field,
Dr. PERRY invites the fullest investigation into his
credentials, and gives his Personal Consideration to
each Case, and in all cases tells the Patient the exact
nature of his complaint, the cost of a cure, and the time
it will take.
Dr. PERRY’S experience in the treatment of these
Diseases has been so varied and extensive, that he is able
to tell absolutely whether the case is curable or not, and
therefore is willing to
Guarantee to CURE EVERY CASE he Undertakes.
VARICOCELE quickly and successfully treated without operation. DIABETES and TUMOURS treated by a
totally new method of Cutaneous Medication,
jpgf" Send for Dr. PERRY’S Work on Diseases of the Reproductive Organs, Diabetes, Tumours, Skin Diseases,
etc., containing many simple directions as to SELF-MANAGEMENT, the observance of which is, in many cases,
sufficient to place the Patient in a healthy state. All who are in any way affected should procure this work, and
thus have the benefit of his advice and experience. FREE ON API’idCATION.

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.—Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

Melbourne have made lightning-like progress, so will

Dr. Gr. H. RAYMOND,
Tub Eminent
Botanic Physician, Specialist & Medical Writer, .
lias commenced Practice in Sydney, after a residence of
four years in Queensland, twelve months in Western Aus-
tralia*'nearly three years in South Australia, and eighteen
months'in,the City of Melbourne.
The latter place Mr. Raymond was compelled to abandon
in consequence of the climate proving detrimental to ins
- health. ,
during-DR. RAYMOND’S' practical experfemsp of nine
rears in Australia he has built, up a reputation un-
approached by any other physician in chronic diseases in
the colonies. Dr. Raymond has, also relieved and cured
patients who had tried’to no avail the so-called leading
medical talent in the world. Proof of,this will be seen in
his valuable.and scientific publications; and Dr. Raymond
would'call the attention of deaf people to Ids latest scien-
tific paper on the “Merits and Demerits of Artificial Ear-
Drums and Electro-Magnetic Treatment.”
DR. RAYMOND would also inform deaf persons that lie
ts the Only AURIST in the British Empire (hat ever
fallacy of sticking ear-drums in the: ear for
cure of deafness ; and, moreover, it is rank quackery for-
any “ Aurhft ” or “Oculist” to induce people to believe
that a mere external remedy will cure a disease, the root
of which lies iu the general constitution.
DR. RAYMOND is a Thorough Physician, as well as a
Specialist ; hence his unrivalled success.

SWOK\ <'KKTiriCATE, —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To 11. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than otic doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

ponsibility. The aim of every Government is
to get through as best it can and bequeath all
its difficulties to the Government that comes
after it, and the object of eA’ery generation of
humanity is to dodge immediate calamity, and
to pass the cataclysm on to the generation
Avhich is to follow. Politics in general is simply
the science of not caring a straw for posterity*
and the world has practised this art so long that
posterity, as a rule, has had a bad time of it*
Everything that is moveable or negotiable has
been traded off at some period or other in the
world’s history, with a joyous disregard for the
fact that the people who are to come have had
no voice in the disposal of their birthright, and
but for the fact that the planet itself is, in a
great measure, a fixture, it Avould most likely
have been sold out of its orbit, and the men of
future ages would have been left with no solid
resting-place or permanent habitation. As it is
the landlord owns the earth, and reluctantly
alhnvs the rest of humanity to walk on it
because there is no other place to put them.
Their presence is objectionable and leads to
the undue Avear and tear of a sphere Avhich is
private property, and if they could be throAvn
into the upper air, and prevented from coming
down again, the advantages would be manifest.
When the statesmen of the past sold or gave
away the earth, they were doubtless aware that
posterity would want some solid substance to
sit down upon, but, as usual, they passed on
the responsibility. The purchasers of the
planet being unable to lift their property and
carry it aAvay with them, and deposit it in a saf 0
place, their position never became absolutely
secure ; but they and their descendants have
camped on top of their goods ever since, and
warned off the rest of humanity. These latter,
of course, have no legal right or licence to be
there at all, for the world avhs practically all
sold before they came, and no man has any
business in a globe which belongs to someone
else ; but, as they cannot be got rid of, the
landlord puts up with their presence and
charges them for standing room. The arrange-
ment is an eminently cumbersome one, but the
man who invented it—Avhoever he might be -
passed it on as a temporary expedient, and it
has been passed on persistently ever since.
# # #
The ingenious speculator Avho first sold the
earth, and the daring financier who first bought
it, are both dead, but their evil deeds live after
them. They Avere mere temporary animals
tAvo commonplace constructions of dust, Avith
no more claim to immortality than the rest of
their kind, but because they were allowed for a
brief space to crawl upon the surface of this
planet they conceived the brilliant idea of claim-
ing possession of it to all eternity, and trading
off the rights of all succeeding generations.
Their title was precisely the same as that of
the fly which, because it was allowed to walk
for a minute, unsquashed, on the bald head of
an emperor, assumes the right to sell that
potentate and all his descendants to another
insect of its own race. But somehow the
human family failed to realise the absurdity
of transient man trading off the infinite.
It allows itself to be fined and imprisoned and
assessed in damages for standing on its own
earth, because some nameless heap of dust
which was buried centuries ago left behind it a
document declaring that it should be so to the
end of time. It grovels to the dead monopolist
as well as to the one who is in the flesh, and it
seems incapable of realising that the earth
belongs only to its living inhabitants, and that
the dead proprietor has no more claim upon it,
and no more Amice in its disposal, than the ass
that was buried yesterday. The human race is
merely a tenant-for-life. Its control over the
earth ends in the grave, and the deceased land-
lord, whatever authority he was alloAved to
claim during his life, can leave none behind
him, for being dead he owns nothing, and own-
ing nothing he can transmit nothing. But by
the insane principle of hereditary right the man
Avho has fooled away his oavii claim to the free
use of the planet which is the common property
of all its inhabitants, is also alloAved to fool away
the claim of all his descendants, and the man
Avho has usurped the earth is allowed not only
to enjoy the fruits of his own brigandage, but
to perpetuate the injustice in his posterity.
The dust of the dead landholder and the dead
coav are undistinguishable, but the one pile of
ashes is nothing, while the other is permitted
even in its grave to steal the common heritage
of humanity through the succeeding ages.
# # #
When the world had once accepted the prin-
ciple that man could put futurity up to auction,
and could lawfully buy-and sell and mortgage
and barter not only his own right to live on
God’s earth but that of all his posterity, it was
soon found that the principle Avas capable of in-
definite expansion. The grand axiom on which
national credit is based is that it is honourable
and lawful for an insane generation to have a
high old time, utterly regardless of conse-
quences, and leave its successors to toil and
starve in their efforts to pay the bill. England
fooled away some £700,000,000 in the attempt
to crush the ueAv-found liberties of France, and
though 80 years have passed since then it is
paying the bill yet, and will probably be still
paying it in the last days of the British empire.
According to the drivel of “hereditary right”
the honour of the nation is pledged to the
liquidation of that stupendous invoice for old-
time bigotry, and on this principle every Go-
vernment, as Avell as every individual, is allowed
to hand down the consequences of its oavii un-
fathomable folly to all time. But the nation
consists of the living, not of the dead, and the
nation which incurred this tremendous liability
is as defunct as that which fought at Salamis.
The men who borrowed these millions pledged
their own honour for their repayment; they
could not pledge the honour of their descendants
for no one can borrow on the personal security
of an unborn race ; and Avhen the deranged
generation which Avhooped for the great French
Avar died out it took its liability along with it
to the other Avorld. The theory that the nation
of to-day must pay for the blood-thirsty
carnival of its forefathers is as hopelessly un-
reasonable as the theory that the citizen of to-
day must go to gaol for the burglary of his de-
ceased progenitor. The men of the nineteenth
century are no more responsible for the deeds
of the men of the eighteenth than they are for
those of the Hittites who reigned at Carchemish.
And as for the venerable plea that the honour
of our ancestors demands the sacrifice, it may
fairly be urged that these same ancestors Avere
somewhat short of honour themselves when
they were aliA-e, and now that they are dead
they haA r e probably gone to a place where the
article would be entirely superfluous. And,
moreover, both nations and Governments have
been so studiously regardless of posterity that
posterity may well be excused if it returns the
sentiment.
# # #
The theory of hereditary right has innumer-
able ramifications. The Australian loyalist
bases his reverence for England on the fact that
his forefathers Avere born there, and lived and
died there, and in the face of this unreasoning
sentiment it is useless to point out that his fore-
fathers arc dead now, and, therefore, it matters
not one iota Avhere they were born ; that they
are decayed and turned to grass and their
alleged souls have departed—it would be in-
A-idious to inquire where ; and that in any case
they were born where they Avere only by acci-
dent and might as reasonably have been born
anyAvhere else. And it is equally useless to
demonstrate that the modern generation of
Englishmen have no claim on him because of his
ancestors, seeing that they neither knew nor
cared for these ancestors, nor did the ancestors
care for them ; and that loyalty to the country
itself is a hollow sentiment for the country is a
mere inanimate arrangement of rocks and mud
and decayed vegetation, and dirt is not in itself
a loveable institution. And not content with
his own baseless adoration, this monotonous
fanatic demands that the Australian nation in
general shall for ever owe a debt of gratitude to
the “Mother Country” for its services in found-
ing this neAV State in the Pacific, quite oblivious
of the fact that Avhatever debt might at one
time have existed the men avlio “ founded ”
these colonics are dead and all but forgotten,
and their sons and successors did not found
Australia (it Avas “ found” by Cook and several
others) and therefore deserve no gratitude,
while the Mother Country itself—the only per-
manent institution in the case—is only a
geological specimen, and never moved from its
station in the far-off North Sea to found any-
thing. But, alas, even grovel is hereditary,
and the man whose remote progenitor was a
large, coarse, ignorant person and much addicted
to beer in a distant land, finds in that circum-
stance a sufficient reason why he should whoop
for evermore on behalf of the country where
that distant relative is buried and forgotten ;
and the man whose great-grandfather stole the
fee-simple of a large patch of land is therefore
entitled to keep on stealing the same land and
to hand down the swindle to future generations;
and the nation whose ancestors spent countless
millions in assault and battery upon ancestors
of some other nation is crippled to all futurity
by an insane effort to pay for the powder that
was exploded and the cannons that were burst
in the far-off ages. All these things are heredi-
tary—in fact, pretty nearly everything in this
world is hereditary excepting brains, which are
an accidental circumstance and of infrequent
occurrence.
* * *
The doctrine of hereditary right is, in short,
an elaborate system by which the world shunts
its debts and responsibilities, its prejudices,
crimes, animosities, and everything else that is
bad, on to posterity. The curse of humanity is
that it ever had any ancestors, and the curse is
intensified by the fact that it chooses to cherish
and perpetuate the memory of these ancestors.
Considering the deeds and character of ancestors
in general, the folly of this proceeding passes
description. The hereditary principle is the
basis of landlordism, for under it men assume
to dispose of the right of other men yet unborn
to use the soil, in defiance of the obvious law
that every generation of humanity has an equal
title to the earth, and that no one can sell the
just claims of posterity any more than he can
sell posterity itself into personal slavery. It is
the basis of monopoly, for by it accumulated
fortunes are passed down from father to son,
and ninety-nine per cent, of mankind are born
to hopeless toil in order that one per cent, may
be born to affluence. It is the corner-stone of
monarchy and aristocracy, for a fatuous world
has taken it for granted, if one man has risen
to power by conspicuous merit or fraud or force
or lying, that it must endure his descendants
for all time, or else get rid of them by violence,
and on the same principle, it might as reason-
ably have resolved that if one man be hanged,
then his descendants should likewise be hanged
till the family becomes extinct. Also, it is the
groundwork of patriotism —that costly and
questionable virtue, which consists chiefly in
plundering another nation for the benefit of our
own, and in embezzling someone else’s country
that our country may grow larger, and in en-
slaving some feeble race in the sacred name of
liberty. The hereditary principle found its
noblest exponent in the old Gothic warrior
who declined to accept the doctrines of Chris-
tianity on the ground that his pagan ancestors
were already in Gehenna, and he preferred to
join them, rather than be solitary and neglected
among the seraphim in Paradise, and three-
fourths of the world stands to-day just where
that Goth did fifteen hundred years ago.
# # #
Some day the world will repudiate the old
debts, the old landlords and land-titles, the
ancient laws and • precedents, the hereditary
monarchs and aristocrats and monopolists, and
all the inherited lumber of antiquity in one
comprehensive act, on the ground that it is
weary to death of its ancestors, and can carry
their burden no longer. It will realise for the
first time that all men are born free and equal—-
that the son of the statesman or the millionaire
must start on precisely the same basis as the
son of the assassin who was hanged, or the
descendant of the outcast who died in the
gutter. It will learn that the offspring of an
illicit amour does not inherit the infamy of his
parents, and that the saint does not hand down
his halo to posterity, and it will abolish the
entire law of inheritance as an old, exploded
superstition. In short, the world will under-
stand at last that its ancestors are dead and
forgotten and turned to grass, and that to
holler for grass is folly, and to fight for grass is
bigotry and ignorance, and to die for grass is
rampant madness, for grass is only hay at the
best, and hay is a common vegetable, which is
sold by the ton, and cut up into chaff, and
given to the cow. And when the world ceases
to scream about its ancestors it will also cease
to cherish the hallowed drivel which these
ancestors left behind them, and it will lose its
reverence for the ancient abuses which it has
valued because they were old and cracked and
decrepid ; and it will give up trying to pass its
responsibilities on to posterity because posterity
will refuse to take them over.
Quack Remedies for Social Ailments.
Economists, who consider that production for
profits’ sake and its concomitant the wage-
system, are unalterably imposed by an immut-
able law of nature on civilised communities,
argue that poverty - also a concomitant of
profit-production may be exorcised by slight
modifications of the relations now existing
between Labour and Capital, petty alterations
in the toiler's domestic economy, or the complete
federation of labour for protective purposes.
These quack remedies for the complete cure of
a disease that is manifest in every fibre of the
social organisation, are known as Profit-sharing,
Voluntai'y Combination, Thrift, Neo-Malthusian-
ism, and Trades-unionism,
# * #
Profit-sharing, at present a much-prescribed
panacea for the abatement of the prevailing
economic war, can only be considered a palliative
of limited application and uncertain duration.
Limited in application, it cannot allay a dis-
content that is well-nigh universal; that its
duration must be uncertain is not less evident,
for in an age of competition, the industry that
is not conducted on expense - minimising
principles, must eventually succumb, simply
because*it can be habitually undersold by the
less benevolent rivals who have also during
commercial crises ampler reserves at command.
Moreover, even should such industries prove
for a time successful, the general desire to enter
heir employ would, most probably, even were
profit-sharing continued, force down wages
until the total earnings of their employes Avere
on an equality with those prevailing elsewhere.
Whilst profit and not use is the incentive to
production, poverty and its attendant evils will
continue to exist, and the division of surplus
values between certain employers and their em-
ployes can do nothing to lighten the burdens
borne by the bulk of the community, or to cool
society’s feverish pulse.
# # #
Voluntarily Co-operation, an Individualistic
remedy, proposes that the workers shall contri-
bute their savings towards a common fund
which they shall then employ as capital and
co-operatively turn to profit. If reform is only
to be attained by such means centuries must
elapse ere it can be brought about. Consider:
in these times of expensive machinery and
gigantic undertakings, how can the slowly
accumulated pence of the workers, whose earn-
ings barely provide necessaries, enable them to
enter into competition with those who have
behind them all that has been expropriated
from labour since Time first was ? Or should
some of these Industrial Partnerships show
signs of making way, monopoly, by combining
to undersell temporarily, could quickly close
every market against them, and then, their
ruin complete, could again restore prices to
their former level. Few T productive co-operative
concerns have been attempted ; the successful
distributive ones have, as a rule, been in reality
joint-stock concerns, existing for the benefit of
certain consumers who are shareholders, and
compelled by competition to remunerate em-
ployes at prevailing rates.
* * #
Then we have the remedies of the penny-wise-
pound-foolish oracles, whose canting apothegms
were embroidered in red wool on the school-
samplers of the last generation. Poverty,
according to them, is caused by the impro-
vidence of the poor, extravagance has been the
bane of the pauper, and riotous living is likely
to impair the patrimony of the babe born in a
workhouse. “ Keep down your family,” they
babble to the wage-drudge; “Be abstemious
and saving, and so you will be happy and pros-
perous.” As if the limitation of one worker’s
family, or ten workers’ families, and the per-
sonal betterment attending thereon, could
ameliorate the condition of the proletary, any
more than the escape of one slave, or ten
slaves, had anything to do with the abolition
of black slavery ; as if the miserable savings
of a poorly-paid, self-abnegating drudge, even
should he crush all the joy out of life, could
ever do more than tide him OAmr the first inevi-
table rainy day. Besides, such individual
advancements are, without doubt, injurious to
workers in the mass, for each secession from the
ranks of the labourers to those of the loungers
increases the burdens of those left struggling in
the mire of wage-servitude. Furthermore, a
universal abstemiousness of toilers, by limiting
demand and therefore lessening production,
would, in time, defeat its own object by de-
priving many economical wage-earners of the
opportunities to labour and consequently to
save. It would also inevitably lower wages,
for the rate of pay in all countries is determined
mainly by the payee’s standard of living, and
the wage-earners, content for a time to live on
rice for their own benefit, would quickly be
forced to subsist on it continuously for the
benefit of monopoly.
* * #
Trades-Unionism has done more to alleviate
the lot of labour than anything under heaven,
and yet it must be admitted that it is only an
expediency, not an all-embracing reform; a
corporation which benefits its members, but
can do little to assist labour in the lump.
Indeed, it has been said that trades-unions have
formed an aristocracy of labour, whose privi-
leges are gained not at the expense of employers
but at that of the consumer and the unskilled,
uncombined toilers outside the guild. ‘ ‘ Con-
sidered as benefit-societies,” says Morrison
Davidson, “in subsidising the man out of
work, they enable wealthy capitalists who
have glutted the market to indulge in luxuries
when they ought to be paying rates. ” There
is much truth in the statement. At present
unions usually fail to obtain recognition of their
claims mainly through the existence of large
numbers of non-unionists whose wants compel
them to accept employment on any terms, under
any conditions. (Nor would the absorption of
all these stragglers into a universal union exor-
cise poverty while monopoly holds the keys to
the storehouses of wealth, for capital—limited
in its operations by artificial bound- .ies—could
not find employment for all, and so the support
of those out of work would fall on the shoulders
of those who were in work, and the aggregate
earnings of wage-workers would not be in-
creased.
* * *
Strikes are in themselves evil, even when
they result in improvement to the position of
the striker, and when monopolists become
thoroughly federated, then such satisfactory
results will be more and more difficult of attain-
ment. In fact, these pacific revolts of labour
will then resemble the attack on a well-
provisioned, armour-plated citadel by a horde of
naked, unarmed savages. Kot only do the civil
forces battle for monopoly, hunger is also on its
side. When sinew meets suet in physical con-
flict the latter must go under, but when starva-
tion is the test, then biceps and bone must
succumb before the life-sustaining, heat-sup-
plying properties of blubber. The “fat lady
of any circus would outlive its “strongman
during a forty days’ fast in any wilderness.
* * *
Therefore, as none of these schemes can
ensure to all men the continuous physical,
mental and moral sustenance necessary to
healthy and intelligent existence, it becomes
evident that quack-doctorings of the sickly
social system can do little or nothing to purge
away the poverty that permeates its every
pore, and it may be justly surmised that nothing
less than a replacement of the artificial system
of production for profit by the natural one of
production for use, can be of universal benefit.
To that goal let us go.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Evolution.”
From the lengthy instalments of David Syme’s
forthcoming book, published periodically in the
Melbourne Aoe, on the above subject, it appears
that the author does not disparage the theory
‘tself but rather the details of its illustration as
1 tehed by Darwinians. ‘‘ Sexual ” or “ natural ”
selection, says Symb, does not produce varia-
tions, but au contraire preserves existing types,
with an increased tendency to atavism in the
offspring, in proportion to the inbred qualifica-
tions of the progenitors. The “struggle for
existence ” admittedly results in the “survival
0 f the fittest,” hujusmodo. There are two
factors concerned in organic modifications : the
external and the internal; but both must co-
operate to produce a permanent change. If a
certain class of organisms be subjected to
variations in their conditions of life in
uniform and prolonged manner, and the
organisms themselves respond by adapting
or adjusting themselves to their environments,
then there will have occurred a constant suc-
cession of favourable variations from which new
species may finally become evolved. Those
organisms which best comply with the exigencies
of their particular surroundings survive longest
under them, and it is immaterial whether this
species of response take the form of effort or
abstinence, positive or negative — i.e., by ex-
pansion, contraction, or fixed inertness. So far
Syme has decidedly struck a new patch and
scored one better than his predecessors, but he
then goes on to say : “ The directing power in
every instance must proceed from the organism
itself, the external conditions being only the
occasion for and not the cause of the variations. ”
phis directing power he declares to Ire indi-
vidual, organic intelligence. The present
writer cannot but admit that he has encountered
worse hypotheses dealing with this most diffi-
cult problem of life, but after grave considera-
tion thereon he would submit the suggestion
that the directing power of existence and the
factor of all its permutations, combinations,
and variations, is the active principle of motion.
This principle in different ratios of acceleration
demonstrates itself as light, heat, sound, gas,
„ross material, vitality, and finally intelligence.
T’lie vibrations of atomic motion seek a uni-
versal equilibrium of rest which, if attained,
would result in the production of a universal
vacuum in nature. All particles possess affi-
nities and antipathies, i. e. , reflex relationships,
and their constantly unsuccessful struggles
create those endless changes which are cease-
lessly in operation, the tokens of which con-
stitute decay, destruction, renovation, and
fruition. Is it not simpler to deny the existence
of any special directing power of evolution
other than that of the interrelative functions of
motion, interacting spontaneously and involun-
tarily according to the exigencies of their sur-
roundings, whence is derived the theory of
perennial evolution and involution ? It would
rather appear probable that the complex
developments of vitality and intelligence are
■products of a simpler principle than that they
should be the factors of them ? But to explain
how the principle of unequal motion primarily
originated and thereby account for that unin-
cluded residuum whereby alone any doctrine
can be positively held proven is as impossible as
it is to satisfy the demands of the irrepressible
questioner who requires for conviction your
fixed date certifying to the commencement and
conclusion of all things in nature.

Two Statues.
Governor Phillip, the commonplace naval
officer who filled the triple office of gaoler, boss
hangman and chief flogger to the infant colony
of Australia is shortly to be honoured with a
statue in Sydney. He was the first pompous
official in the great roll of Australian Bumble-
dom, and his dull name is therefore to be
written large on a massive column in order that
all the world may remember him. His history,
as written by a grovelling pickpocket travelling
under an alias, sets forth the fact that he built
the first gallows and the first gaol, and whaled
the first convict, and looked after the details
of the first execution ever performed on this
continent, and there the record of his good
deeds comes to an end. He was an ordinary
hull-headed officer of the type which prevailed
in the last century—that, and nothing more.
But 1m was the representative of loyalty, and
therefore his parochial individuality is to be
enshrined on a meaningless plug of brass, by a
generation which still worships everything that
bears the stamp of Constituted Authority. Aus-
tralia is nominally the land of a democratic
nation, and whoops copiously for freedom ; and
meanwhile she raises a lying cenotaph to the
gaolor, Phillip, and the patriot Lalor is
already almost lost in oblivion. The proposal
that a monument should be built in honour of
the fiery digger whose gallant but ill-conducted
insurrection practically ended the rule of the
chi officialdom in Victoria fell flat at the very
outset. The dull and pompous ass who governed
the southern colony had for years blocked
the demand for constitutional government, but
the armed rising of the infuriated population at
Ballarat shook his dignity to its foundations, and
he surrendered almost unconditionally lest a
worse thing should befall him. History, that
dreary chronicle of inane monarchs and imbecile
dignitaries, leaves out the name of the insurgent
whose pick and shovel threatened to overset the
' ice-regal throne, and Australia has already for-
gotten that butfor Peter LALORandhis comrades
Victoria might have ranked as a Crown colony ta
this day. He was the only colonist of note who
s hed his blood for the Australian nation, and
almost the only Democrat who refused to grovel
01 ' a title in his old age, but Democracies are
proverbially ungrateful, and ingratitude is the
° ne enduring democratic sentiment in these
colonies, Melbourne has x’aised a stately monii
ment to Cordon, the cranky hired butcher who
massacred the patriots of China, and fooled
away the lives of Egyptian soldiers and Euro-
pean settlers by hi s insane crusade at Khartoum;
bjduey has cumbered her streets with the
statues of Victoria and the dull Genrtan who
shared her throne and drew a. lavish income
from the British taxpayer. Even Daniel
O’Connell has been perpetuated in enduring
bronze by his Australian worshippers, for dis-
tance lends enchantment to the view, and the
Irish patriot, because he is afar off* is of more
account than the Australian patriot who lived
and died in a country which was incapable of
recognising his merit. And so Phillip's statue
is rising, and the memory of the dull official
clod who brought out the human garbage of
England and flung it on these shores will be
enshrined in history through the coming cen-
turies ; while the gallant Peter Lalok, who
built neither gaol nor gallows, has only his
tombstone for his visible monument.

A Rampant Twopenn’orth.
Last week Chief-Justice Higinbotham of Vic-
toria, one of the very few public men in that
colony who has not deserved the infamy of a
K.0.M.G.-ship, sent a donation of £SO to the
Trades Hall funds, and promised a further sum
of £lO weekly, so long as the employers made
conciliation impossible by refusing to hold a
conference except on the assurance of Labour’s
absolute surrender. The terms of his letter made
it plain that his object was not to express any
opinion as to the original justice of the quarrel
on either side, but to protest against the
ferocious cry of “No quarter” which the
monopolists have set up. Notwithstanding
which that infuriated twopenn’orth, the Argus
(of which Mr. Higinbotham was formerly
editor), rises with murder in its eye to dis-
course on the situation :
Chief-Justice Higinbotham has sufficient public con
science to excuse his action on the ground that the
employers have not granted a conference, although he
must know perfectly well that a conference can he held
as soon as the Trades-hall Council chooses to state its
terms definitely or to say in what sense it can ao-,
cept the terms proposed by the other side. But it
is to be regretted that the man who holds the great and
onerous and responsible office of Chief Justice has de-
scended into abetting faction and supporting a class
tyranny. It might have been his place to preside over a
court of conciliation, such as has already been suggested
at the conference between the Broken Hill directors and
miners ; but this is now rendered impossible by the im-
pulsive and foolish action, which means that the Highest
legal authority in the land is an active partisan of one
side. It would have been more becoming to have pointed
out what the law really is, than to have openly encouraged
men who advocate boycotting, and to have assisted a
party that relies upon intimidation. Chief Justice
Higinbotham must be aware that in his position he repre-
sents the public, who by no means sympathise with the
strike, and that it is a most indecent thing for him to
lend himself to any faction.
The solitary redeeming feature about this out-
pouring is that only part of it is lying, the other
part being merely abject hogwash. Just two
weeks ago the Argus denounced Unionism
because it was fatal to Individualism, and now
its shriek is loud and long because Mr. Higin-
botham has asserted his own individual opinion.
Just one week ago it cursed at large on the
subject of Freedom of Contract, and now it piles
up its anathema because the Chief Justice
claims any freedom at all apart from the Argus.
In between these episodes it has exulted in the
brutal insolence of Patterson, and howled with
glee when that bloodless warrior, Price, bade
his rampant militia to ‘ ‘ fire low ”at the
Unionists, and “lay them out,” and the inde-
cent threats and intimidation of these two
public servants were a good and holy thing in
its eyes. But if its bigotry be stupendous, its
incoherence is still more massive. It is no part
of the Chief Justice’s business to arbitrate in
the present quarrel, and whether or not he dis-
qualifies himself for a post which he is under no
obligation to fill, is entirely his own affair. If
the Employers’ Union be willing to grant a con-
ference ‘‘ as soon as the Trades Hall Council
chooses to state its terms definitely,” then that
Union has so disguised its meaning as to prove
that it is unfit to be trusted with'the English
language. And Mr. Higinbotham does not
represent the public ; he represents the law, and
the law represents nothing in particular except
the lawyers ; the men who represent the public
are the members of the Ministry, and the
Ministry, through the medium of Patterson,
has lent itself to the faction of Capital, and is
out looking for gore. And lastly, as the Strike
is a social, and not a legal, difficulty, any Judge
has a full and unquestioned right to take a side
in the discussion if it seems good in his eyes to
do so, and even the Argus is powerless to
deprive him of this privilege.
A New Weapon.
“So long as the world lasts,” said a cheap
modern philosopher, “men will do three things
—make love, make war, and gamble.” But now
and then the world is favoured with some sign
that war is not quite necessarily so enduring as
the other two elements in the great trio of pas-
sions. Man still desires to put a head on his
fellow man with a hungry intensity that knows
no abatement, but the process is growing more
and more expensive and dangerous. Every now
and then some new invention adds a fresh
horror to the game, and the latest weapon—the
gun invented by an Anglo-Frenchman named
Giffard — promises to make it more unprofit-
able than anything yet heard of. And not only
this, but his appalling invention gives to the
solitary individual a power which bids fair to
render monarchy an unsatisfactory speculation.
Every monarchy began as an absolute des-
potism, tempered only by judicious assassina-
tion, but gradually kings and emperors grew
weary of being employed as public targets, and
bit by bit they have surrendered a great part of
their authority, rather than be poisoned and
shot and mangled by the frenzy of their beloved
subjects. But dynamite is uncertain, and the
ordinary gun is clumsy and noisy and treacher-
ous, and it is necessary'to shoot at a potentate
so often to gain the smallest concession that
despotism is dying very hard. The Giffard
rifle promises to revolutionise all this. It is
noiseless and its discharge is without smoke*
There is nothing whatever to betray the where-
abouts of the user, Imt it fills the air with a hail
of bullets streaming forth at the rate of a hun-
dred a minute, and carrying a silent and
invisible death everywhere. The obnoxious Czar
or Kaiser who goes out from his bomb-proof
palace has a secret enemy waiting for him
against which all precaution is useless. There
is no need for elaborate conspiracy or prepara-
tion. All that is required is to bring the
muzzle of the deadly implement to bear and set
it in motion, and the monarch and his guards
are torn and riddled and blown to pieces by a
storm of lead coming from no one knows where.
When once the Gjpfard gun comes into general
tise monarchy has got to go. The reign of force
will be over. It is no longer worth while to be
a Czar with power to knout everybody who is
disaffected, and send him to Siberia afterwards
if any cripple can blow the pompous despot into
cat’s-meat at a long range without the faintest
chance of discovery. It is no use to defy* the
lightning with a bayonet ; and it matters
nothing that the monarch may be surrounded
and defended by a thousand similar weapons
when no one can tell where the invisible death
comes from. Any ordinary measures of defence
against such conditions would be hopeless and
impotent; it would be as profitable to throw a
brick at Providence, or to shoot at an epidemic.
If the new rifle only answers the inventor’s
expectations it will do more to make tyranny
unpopular than a dozen revolutions and a
hundred years of dynamite ; and the best
course which an obnoxious sovereign can take
under such conditions is to seize his harem and
his carpet-bag and quit before a worse thing
befalls him.
Mormon Outcasts.
The President of the Mormons has, says a
cablegram, renounced polygamy on behalf of
his church, and the modern Gentiles are to be
admitted to full rights of citizenship. What
is to be the result to the unwived Mormon
ladies does not seem to be clear, from the bare
statement of facts to hand. Will they be
turned adrift as raddled ewes whom few will
care to acquire as wives? Will they be
retained in the Mormon households as concu-
bines ? Or will they be whitewashed into free
and independent domestic servants to whom
the protection of the law on criminal assaults
will be supplied ? What about the ‘ ‘ sealed
wives ?” The outlook for these poor liberated
women does not seem, on first reflections, to be
a roseate one. Two very open alternatives
seem ready made for them. Either they must
consent to remain with their Mormon hitherto
husbands as chattels of the harem, or—they
must become more desperate chattels still.
Either of these professions would probably
prove more palatable and less heart-wearying
than the strenuous fate of penitent, soiled
doves. In this wholesale abolition of polygamy,
will any scheme of compensation be formulated
for these greatest sufferers by the sudden
wrench from past settled conditions ? Happy
thought ! They might travel the globe in per-
forming troupes, as did the virtuous Fisk
Jubilee Singers, and rake in funds to establish a>
Mormon Divorcees’ Asylum. When the living
race of inmates of such an establishment were
all consigned to the resurrection—at which
there is to be no question of ‘ ‘ Whose husband
is he ?”•—-■the asylum could be opened as a
General Divorcees’ Elysium, the supply for
which could never fail until marriage had been
altogether abolished as a universal failure. We
have not patented these ideas.

The Melbourne police authorities have stated,
in reply to a Government enquiry, that they
are not aware of any recent material increase
in the number of gaming-houses. The daisies
of the field are not more fresh and indecent than
the red-faced bar-loafers who “ make enquiries ”
respecting illegal betting. On such matters as
the Sunday sale of two small oranges to two
small boys, or the disposal, of a glass of stout
three minutes after closing-time, they are chock
full of information received, and the Guy
Fawkes mystery with which they pursue in-
vestigations into those cases is awesome to look
upon. But when five dozen ill-looking blas-
phemers, rigged out in check suits and dia-
monds which proclaim their occupation aloud,
open five dozen new cigar-shops, and plaster
racing telegrams over the windows, and have
their premises invaded by pallid. punters from
morn till night—why, the active and intelligent
D. never surmises anything except that the
retail traffic in tobacco is increasing apace.
Perchance he saunters into a den and hears
somebody ask “What price Carbine?” and
when the glittering proprietor says “ Ten to
one,” he (the guileless D.) concludes that
Carbine is a choice brand of cigars at ten for a
shilling. Perhaps he buys a pound of Carbine
himself, and although the enterprising trades-
man gives him a ticket instead of goods, he
feels sure that it must be the custom of the
trade, and returns to headquarters to write out
a satisfactory report on the invisibility of fresh
gaming-houses.
“ The Hew Utopia ” is the title of an ambitious
pamphlet wherein Alex. W. Johnston, M.A.,
by grafting-free railway carriage for goods and
passengers on to the single-tax, endeavours to
promulgate anew scheme for the abolition of
poverty. In his preface the author argues that
labourers are wrongly styled producers, “ be-
cause the produce of their labour does not
belong to them ; they may never even see it,
and have not responsibilities of any kind in con-
nection with it,” and proceeds to assert that
“ the owner of the product of labour ” is the
real producer. Why the English language
should be perverted for the sake of a puerile
whim, why the, producer of “the produce of
labour ” should be deprived of the title which
all the economists have hitherto described him',
by, is not evident ? One might as well argue that
the consumer is the true producer, for lie, at
least, unlike both labourer and capitalist, is sure to
see the produce lie purchases—unless as short-
sighted as Mr. Johnston ami will be the last
to undertake “its responsibilities.” As for the
author’s main argument, until both land and
capital are nationalised it would be surely
unwise to saddle the community with the
expense of maintaining railways chiefly for the
benefit of those Avho can afford time to traveler
have large quantities of goods requiring con-
veyance from one spot to another. Granted
that it would open up land, increase population
and rural land-values, it Mould seldom enable
“ the sick poor to have the benefit of a change
of air,” and as it is certain that goods M ill not
be cheapened in direct proportion to the amount
saved in freight by the trader, it would result
in the enrichment of the landlord and the pro-
duce-owner at the expense of the already over-
burdened “producer.” Moreover, the compli-
cations which would, without doubt, arise are
bewildering to contemplate.
The New South Wales Blue Book for 18S!I
shows an annual pension-roll of no less than 72(1
persons—not inclusive of retired civil servants
who have drawn gratuities for loss of office".
The largest amount on the annual list is £2620
to ex-Judge and ex-Solicitor-General Sir
William M. Manning (or more than he got
when in full work), and the lowest £l4 18s. 3d.
to a retired trooper, which sum he has carefully
drawn for forty years. Next to him comes Mrs.
Nelson, widow of a constable shot in 1865 at
Collector, near Goulburn, by that bloodthirsty
young ruffian, Dunn. A grateful country allows
this lady the munificent sum of £ls per annum
to solace her for the loss of her bread-winner,
who was assassinated in the execution of his
duty ! The ex-judge and politician gets one
hundred and seventy times as much as the
widow of the slaughtered policeman. After all,
are men and women really made of one uniform
quality of clay ?

Hale the letter-writing population of Sydney
seems seized with the idea that it would be a
good thing if the New South Wales Govern-
ment took advantage of the results of the great
fire and resumed sufficient of the land on which
the now useless buildings stand, to extend Post-
Office-place from Pitt-street to Oastlereagh-
street in a similar fashion to that in which they
acquired the George to Pitt-street portion.
Year by year it becomes evident that some-
thing will have to be done to accommodate the
increasing traffic of Sydney streets, and proba-
bly only those who are interested in the proper-
ties of King, George and Pitt-streets, where
fashionable wares are sold, will oppose the
construction of anew and splendid thorough-
fare (named, say, Parkes-place) extending from
its hub, the Post-Office, to Macquarie-street on
one side, and on the other to the waters of
Darling Harbour. Mayor Burdekin opposes
the scheme on the grounds of expense, but the
experience of other cities —say, for instance,
that of the Edinburgh Corporation in the con-
version of a dirty wynd named St. Mary’s into
a fine wide street —shows that if the matter be
properly managed, not only would the trans-
action prove inexpensive, but it might posi-
tively result in a profitable monetary return to
Government. Let us again annex the unearned
increment.

The carnivorous landlord is organising an in-
surrection in Melbourne. For many years that
city has owned an evil reputation as a region of
open drains, and noxious effluvia, and typhoid,
and diphtheria, and other fatal influences, and
its sewage-system seems to have been planned
and organised by one of those Edters-of-TJncleui i-
Things who did scavenger’s duty at Carthage.
Consequently the surviving ratepayers have at
last resolved to spend five millions on the- estab-
lishment of anew sanitary system, and the
landlords graciously signified their approval
and bade them go ahead. But when it tran-
spired that each proprietor would have to con-
nect his own property with the main drains, at
a cost of £lO for every tenement, the owners of
the city rose unanimously and intimated that
the new sanitary system might boil in Tophet
before they would pay a stiver. If every
tenant likes to look after the drainage
of his own house he may, or if he likes
to take his chance of fever, small-pox,
leprosy, and other things he may do that also ;
in shoit he may pay his rent, and die of any
disease he likes—they are all the same price,
and the landlord isn't particular. But the
cholera may come, and the plague may follow,
and another naked Solomon EAGLE'may pervade
the city and howl about the destruction that is
approaching, so long as the propertied classes
manage to dodge the nightmare of that £lO ;
and if they must pay it they will raise the rent
and extract it out of the tenant, and if they
don’t pay it they will raise the rent all the
same. Other things may ebb and flow with an
uncertain motion, but the sun and the rent
never fail to rise. Only unlike the sun the rent
never sets.

The legal element in the Victorian Assembly—
the party which lies and slanders and heaves
mud for hundred-guinea “ retainers ” and lavish
“ refreshers ” —is resolved to die at its post
rather than that the “Law of Evidence Bill”
should pass. The object of this measure is to
prevent the lawyer discharging gratuitous in-
sults at a witness, and offering offensive and in-
decent insinuations upon matters utterly uncon-
nected with the business before examination.
The successful barrister of the present day
usually owes his greatness to his capacity for
scaring an unhappy testifier into convulsions.
He is a coarse individual with a wild and bilious
eye, and he lives by fixing that infuriated optic
upon a nervous witness—a female preferred,
and discharging offensive questions about her
morals and general character, until she grows
confused and incoherent and hysterical, and her
statements get mixed up beyond all human
credibility. Then he discharges a final
blast of language after her, and dis-
misses her with a conviction in her mind
that she has been swearing promiscuously to
everything under the sun, and has got her
character ruined tor ever in the effort. Neither
the witness nor the witness’s relatives are
allowed to pound a barrister for his gratuitous
offensiveness : he cannot lie sued for libel in his
professional capacity ; and so lie goes unkicked,
unbashed, and unhanged. The object of the flaw
of Evidence Bill is to provide that he shall Keep
strictly to the business in hand, and not go out
of his way to make gross and disgusting insinua-
tions that have uo bearing on the case, and the
legal profession at. large is lighting manfully for
the privilege of making disgusting insinuations
whenever il wants to. It earns its retainer by
rowdyism, and it refresher by gratuitous
larrikinism, and when a barrister is made
amenable to the law of libel when he commits
unnecessary libel, three-fourths of his profes-
sional stock-in-trade will be gone for good.


At Sydney, Thomas Frewen abducted from
her home the wife of one Jamieson,
under, it would appear, circumstances of
inexpressible treachery and meanness. Jamie-
son entered divorce-proceedings, and pend-
ing the trial he had Frewen, who it
was alleged intended to abscond,, locked up
in the debtors’ prison at Darlinghurst. One
day he entered the gaol with a pistol and fired
at Frewen ; for this he was tried at the
Criminal Sessions. The jury found nim “not
guilty, ” on the ground that he was temporarily
insane through trouble when he fired the shots
—a decision which, considering all the circum-
stances, must be regarded as doing substan-
tial justice. This French verdict sets one
speculating. Suppose Jamieson had killed
Frewen instead of missing him, the jury on
the basis of their present verdict, would have
been equally bound to acquit prisoner. But
would they have done so ? Also, suppose the
woman involved had not been Jamieson’s lawful
wife but merely a mistress with whom hehad lived
affectionately for years, would Jamieson have
been then acquitted, or would the Pharisaism
of our social system, denying that a man can
possibly have any righteously sentimental stock
in a woman to whom he is not formally married,
have hanged him as high as Hainan ? We
wonder !

The labour-question stands at last prominently
before Australia. The question is whether at
next general elections the workers will deal with
it as a disorderly rabble, or as a discliplined
force acting under intelligent guidance. The
first step in each province should be the appoint-
ment of an electoral committee and an energetic
paid secretary. The first duty of that secretary
should be to request all persons wishing to con-
test electorates to send in their names. On the
receipt of those names a printed democratic
programme should be issued, and each candi-
date requested to sign it, both for publica-
tion and as a guarantee of good faith.
Selections would then be made, and the
candidates selected would be the only ones
to Receive the support of the workers in
each electorate. The first duty of the demo-
cratic party in Parliament would be to buttress
itself by utterly eliminating the property vote,
and by reforming the Constitution, somewhat,
perhaps, in the direction indicated in a recent
Bulletin leader. The whole movement is one
which no man and no party who have good
causes need be afraid of. Whatever the Single-
tax, Local Option, Freetrade, Protection, and
fco on have to recommend them will stand a far
better chance of being effectually recognised in
a Parliament dominated by labour sympathisers
than in such Parliaments as at present exist,
crowded as they are with the useless, lumber of
dead ages, the palisades of property, and moss-
grown precedents for legalised robbery. ‘ ! Purge

Dear Bulletin, —As my case is, I believe,
up to now (sth Oct.) the only one yet tried under
the Masters* and Servants’ Act for inducing men
to violate their agreements to shear, I send you a
brief account of the affair, for you may otherwise
be prejudiced by garbled accounts of a matter
which, altogether apart from myself, is, I think,
of some wider interest than ordinary police-cases.
I am charged under the 9th section o£ the M. and
S. Act witli having induced one James Ryan, a
Shearer, at Mungadal, to violate his agreement by
leaving his work. There were 29 shearers at
Mungadal, and I am prosecuted separately on
account of each shearer. It was proved that I
did “ call out ” the shearers, and in letters to the
public press defended and advocated that action
in general. Having been convicted by the Magis-
trate, that gentleman sentenced me to pay £5 per
man with costs—the aggregate penalty being
£155 12s. Bd. Seeing that the settlement would
involve a heavy draw on the Union funds I re-
marked that, rather than pay any of the fines I
Would spend the rest of my natural life in
gaol, and that a man might as well go to
bell for ice as come to that court for justice.”
Then “I sentence you to 14 days on each of the
29 charges, the sentences to be cumulative,” said
the magistrate. The other cases, 32 in number,
were for three weeks to allow of the
magisterial decision being argued in the Supreme
Court. I got out of gaol, or kept out by deposit-
ing a cheque for amount of fine and costs pending
the Supreme Court decision. Should that be
against me, I shall certainly elect gaol. Op the
Todgimbie remanded cases 1 was bound over in
one surety of £IOO, and myself £IOO. Now,
Bulletin, do you think it a square thing that a
P.M., whose powers of giving imprisonment
are in ordinary cases so greatly circumscribed,
should be able to incarcerate a man over and
over again for what is substantially and really the
same offence ? Here am I, sentenced to be im-
prisoned for a year and six weeks for conveying
the Union’s message to 29 shearers, whereas I
oould only be imprisoned for 14 days had I con-
veyed it to but one. Suppose I had acted as inter-
mediary between the Union and 1000 shearers, as
plight easily have been the case, I could, accord-
ing to this capitalistic law, have been sent up for
14,000 days—or say nearly 40 years! The N.S.W.
law thus gives the mouthpieces of capital—for
without any personal imputation on the inter-
preter of the law in this case, the magistrates must
certainly be so regarded—power, as it were; to inflict
on a man convicted of stealing one pound sterling a
separate term of imprisonment for every farthing or
fraction of which the pound is composed. As it
as, should I be convicted in the Toogimbie cases I
shall have to serve a year and three months at
least in addition to the year and six weeks I am
already sentenced to undergo.—Yours truly,
Arthur Rae, Hay, N.S.W.
Says the S.M. Herald :
Serious as are the commercial and industrial dangers
with which we are threatened by this protracted strike,
they are by no means the most formidable. Our greatest
peril comes from the intrusion, which is inevitable unless
an end is speedily reached, of the labour struggle into
the field of politics. In one colony where a general
election is now imminent preparations are being made for
ihe formation of a labour party. Can the employers in
this colony doubt that similar preparations are being
made here ? One characteristic of social strife of this
Lind is its extreme bitterness and violence. Nothing is
more certain than that if it is begun the most extreme
and violent men will control the situation.
While laws which, as shown above, punish a work-
man a hundred or a thousand times over for the
same offence remain in force, what can be reason-
ably hoped for but a political labour crusade?

846 Maoquarie-street North, Sydney, October 8, 1890.
My Dear Moorabinda, —
The advent of the tuneful and forty-horse-power-
voieed Mdme. Patey, under the management of Churchill
Otton, at Sydney Centenary Hall, has especially put new
life into that large section of the public which misses its
teeth, and its hair at the top, and looks darkly at songs of
the Tosti order which don’t even give you an outline of
the plot. Madame Patey principally gurgles ballads
where no detail is left out, and the last century people
who are quite sure that “Meet me by moo-oon-li-ight
a-a-lone ” has yet to be beaten sit triumphantly in the
front row while their prophetess gives scope and meaning
to their favourite ditties. Madame Patey is medium-sized
and plump with very black hair and features that the
name of “Rebecca” would fit like a glove, and on her
second appearance wore a handsome dress of primrose-
satin brocade with a long train, the left side of skirt and
bodice being finished with folds of yellow crepe. By the
way, the Patey diamonds (which are not going to turn
out paste like Neruda’s) are most scintillating circum-
stances. Four diamond stars in the hair, a diamond
necklet and pendant, bracelets and brooches, made all the
women sorry that fate hadn’t dowered them with a limit
chest-note. Miss Rossow, the assisting soprano, wore a
black lace dress with angel sleeves. Miss Naylor (who
accompanies right through) wore black velvet and a
bouquet of actonotus. At the second concert the
audience were hysterically enthusiastic, triple recalls
being the order of the evening, and Madame Patey, billed
for three, was forced to contribute double that mystic
number of items.
Referring to music. On a suburban concert programme
the other evening a song by Tosti was erroneously billed
as by “Tolstoi.” It came low on the card, too, but every
woman in the audience (they had all read the “ Kreutzer
Sonata”) was firm in her chair till that was disposed of.
And when it came it was the good old “ For Ever and
For Ever.” Such is life.
The Achurch matinee at Sydney Criterion on 4th inst.
was a sobbing fragment calculated to depress the spirits
of a mute, and if it hadn’t been for the first act of “ Dandy
Dick,” which opened the proceedings in an airy and joyful
manner, there wouldn’t have been one snigger from first
to last—excepting Snazelle’s “Siege of Rochelle ” song,
and Leitch’s evergreen “Good Young Man Who Died.’’
Mrs. Oharrington played two acts of “Camille” and the
last act of the “New Magdalen,” and received an ovation
and several floral offerings, including a bouquet of acto-
notus and a posy of waratahs, There was a crowded,
house, and society was there in her springiest gown
headed by Mrs. Burdekin in cream floral pongee and lace
with front of cream chiffon, small black lace toque with
saffron and crimson roses, small crimson fan.
The Women’s Literary Club, started in Sydney, is. to be
a deep-thinking cogitating gathering given to gloomy
theories and subterranean reasonings. It will discuss for
the benefit of the young and thoughtless, all solemn,
moral works of a solid and nature, and its
conversaziones are to be so erudite that the person who is
hazy on political economy or the moral aspect of free-
trade is advised to remain without. This ia. the goal, of
the Club’s ambition, but unfortunately a, frivolous ele
ment has crept in which makes it difficult of attainment,
and the stony glare of the lady who is dissertating on
John Stuart Mill cannot repress the associate who must
find out whether her next neighbour is dressed in pongee
or satin. At present the raison d’etre of the Literary
Club has become rather, confused, and the only clearly-
expressed decision is that it must never never fall to the
level of the “Austral Salon,” which the litterateuses
regard as a frivolous and meretricious combination to be
passed by on the other side.
Of all the thankless tasks under the sun, selling top-
price tickets for a charity show is the very worst of alh
The rare person who purchases seems to think you are a
thief with the craft of ten Fagins in your smile, and
doesn’t care if you know he does, or else he slaps his
silver down patronisingly and icily says “ Here you are !’’
as if you were to be personally benefited, and it’s hard to
say which is the worse to put up with. Everybody
regards the ticket-hawker with a cold, mistrustful eye
and nobody seems to reflect that she’s not button-holeing
people for herself, but for the sacred cause which begins
at home. Of course there are lots of wiry young women
fond of bouncing up office stairs and bearding defenceless
men in their fastnesses, who sell systematically just to be
a little in evidence, and who enjoy a barney with a nice
young unknown in a high collar, and it’s owing to these
that the genuine ticket-vendor is treated so coolly. I
hear that one audacious young woman actually slipped a
charity ticket down a bank-manager’s spine when she got
tired of hearing him refuse.
Science is a solemn, unapproachable thing which, in-
dividualised, means blue goggles and a cotton umbrella,
and spends 20 years in coming to a long Latin conclusion
about an ordinary matter which was patent in plain
English to the meanest intellect from the beginning. The
latest scientific wild-goose chase is the discovery—re-
ported at length in the S.M. Herald—that colours emit
sound: “ Red in a green light emits loud sound.” Cer-
tainly. A female in a tomato jacket and a pea-green
skirt has always been absolutely deafening at a hundred
yards. “ Every kind of material gives sound in different
colours and utters no sound in others.” Of course ! Red
and black are dumb, but the shriek of red and purple is
audible round the corner. Science is evidently trying to
teach its grandmother.
The formal announcement in the dailies that Lady
Carington refused a farewell ball tendered by the citizens
is now refuted. Lady Carington—amiable martyr
she is ! —has expressed her willingness to go once more
into the breach and to make her farewell appearance, a
t were, and preparations for the Citizens’ ball, to be
holden in Centennial Hall on 30th inst., proceed apace,
under the presidency of Mrs. Burdekin. The proceeds
after all expenses have been paid, will go to the Women’s
College movement, in which Lady Carington is deeply
interested.
An enthusiastic person deeply interested with the
N.S.W. Women’s College idea, publishes a premature
psoan over the refusal by Lady Carington of the
valedictory vice-regal ball and suggests that, instead, a
posse of canvassers should float round with the dreaded
subscription-list and raise a few thousands needed to
establish the College, which could then be called the
“Carington,” and be a lasting memorial, &0., &o. But
I’m afraid that even if disguised as a testimonial to Lady
C. the needed amount couldn’t be squeezed out of an
apathetic public. And if it were, why the College should
then be called, the “Carington Canvassers’ College.”
•A bumptious “musician” whose social aspirations
are well-known, rather overdid it recently. He
was engaged to perform at a private dance, and con.
Siderately brought a male friend with him—probably in
case dancing-men were short. The host didn’t see it in
the same light, and the friend was informally ejected.
His sponsor re\ enged himself by keeping horrible “ time”
for the rest of the programme.
The Women’s College concert, under the direction of
Miss Woolley, in the great hall of Sydney University on
16th inst., will be a high-class undertaking, struggled
through in the presence of Lord and Lady Carington.
The bill will be helped along by the St. Cecilia choir, the
choir and orchestra of the Sydney Liedertafel, and other
artists, and it is just possible the hall will not hold the
attendance.
The Diocesan Church Choir annual festival, to eventu-
ate at St. Andrew’s Cathedral on 30th inst. at 7.30, is to
be very special this year. There will be 300 voices, and
the anthems will be by Haydn, Mendelssohn and Stainer.
The Primate, already irreverently known as “Some More”
Smith, will preside in full w r ar-paint on the harmonious
occasion.
At a final meeting of the committee of the State school
children’s farewell concert to Lord and Lady Carington,
held in the Mayor’s room on 2nd inst., it was decided that
the concert should be held in the Centennial Hall (granted
by the Mayor) on 29th inst., that the Carington children
should receive special invitations to be present, and that
the army of small vocalists shall be distinguished by blue,
red, and yellow-and-blaek rosettes. A proposition to
refresh each infant with a bun in a bag was vetoed, a
commemorative card being deemed sufficient guerdon
for their piping services, to say nothing of it’s being ever
so much cheaper. The proceeds of the concert will go to
the Sick Children’s Hospital.
The latest development of the woman’s rights lady is
that she wants to do the proposing herself, and she yearns
to single-handedly win the youth on whom she has cast her
eye, and pop the question to him in the moonlight and
tenderly press him to name the day in the conservatory;
and otherwise emancipate herself from the horrors of
having to say the “yes” or “no” or “25th of July,
George,” herself. She now' argues that women w 7 ould
stand a better chance of connubial bliss if they clinched
their own bargains, so to speak, but as no man w ould
marry a girl he didn’t fancy just because she asked him
to, just as no girl marries a (poor) lover who doesn’t fill
the bill, the position w'ould remain as it was before.
But, looking at the question all round, it strikes me that
the pansy-blossom of to-day does most of the proposing,
anyhow. See how she stares into his eyes, how' her hand
lingereth on his, how she revels in his dreariest conun
drums and giggles at his weariest witticisms—how plainly
she show's her content to sit in his society till the small
hours, how assiduously she thumps the accompaniments
to his screechy tenor. “ She gives me no encourage,
ment,” wails the unwelcome suitor. But the chosen one
is quite sure that he has only to utter the climactic inter-
rogation “ Will you have me ? ” to see the damsel bustle
into his embrace. In this case, which is, the wooed ? Isn’t
his proposal rather a meaningless jangle of acceptance of
her visible favours ?
One is. almost forced to regret the prevalence of flow ers
just now, since many women aeeip to have (he idea that,
though hat and gloves must be en suite, a “ bunch ” of
flowers can be all the colours of a Japanese fan. They
seem to think that a nosegay of scarlet geranium, goes
with a pink gown or that a bouquet of violets is coquettish
against a scarlet background. Take w'esteria, for example,
made fashionable by vice-regal favour. Its amethyst
blossoms are hung and contrasted with every shade of
fawn possible, and the result is really ugly. Then
buttercups. They were fashionable,, and that was enough
to ensure them a place among the buttons of every
damsel no matter what colour her gown was, or how- they
look against her skin. A, nosegay of flowers can abso-
lutely ruin a get-up, just as it can add to it immeasurably.
How greatly is a mauve gown improved by a cluster of
violets, or a creamy, clinging frock by the addition of a
crimson rose !
The grouping and dressing of “Chilperio” at Sydney
Royal are simply soul-satisfying. As Predegonde, Nellie
Stewart w'ears a simple, though artful, peasant’s dress in
a hue of terra-cotta tied round her willowy frame with a
yard of hemp when first the curtain rises. In Act 2 the
costume is an underdress of white chiffon in accordeon-
pleats with sleeves and novel drapery ending in a large
bow on the left side of pale-blue brocade powdered with
gold flowers, the ends fringed with gold, shoes and hose
en suite. The second gown in this act is in silk primrose
brocade embroidered in gold, split up almost to the hip
on the left side, revealing a shapely limb in flesh-pink
tights showing mistily through a white lace drapery ; leg-
of-mutton sleeves in the brocade and a court train of dull
crimson satin brocaded in pearl-grey and lined with flesh-
pink silk, the edges defined with gold galon. The toilette
is adorned by a plethora of stage jewels. In this act
Aggie Kelton wears a charming dress in eau-de-nil silk in
concertina pleats covered with glittering silver sequins
which form the ZoUave fronts and tiny fetching cap
Lastjy, Miss Stewart wears a jessamine dress, the under
skirt Of tiger-yellow, with an accordeon-pleated skirt in
white crepe falling softly over it, a huge yellow sash
finished with gold galon and, fringe and yellow sleeves
checked with gold tinsel, shoes and hose in yellow, and
diamond ornaments. When the limelight falls on thi 8
toilette in the song and pas seul of the last shriek it
looked especially thrilling. The costumes of the kickists
are very harmonious all through—one ballet in lilac and
white satin and silver sequins reminded one, as they
twirled and twisted, of a host of francisoa blossoms in a
high breeze.
The Woollahra Assembly dance at Need’s on the 3rd
inst. was an enjoyable affair, breaking at the Cinderella
hour. Some of the dresses were good i Mrs. (Dr.
Shewen wore French grey silk and face, Mrs. W. Buoknel]
ivory-white armure and duchesse lace with embossed satin
front, gold and pearl ornaments ; Miss Wilson (Bondi)
pale-pink silk with bbbb bodice and diamonds, Miss
O’Hara white liberty silk, and the amount of button-hole
bouquet eabh man had lavished oii himself gave the scene
the air of a country wedding. The supper table had a
very pretty diagonal design in maiden-hair ferns.
The engagementof Miss Mary Gore-a sister of Mrs. W.
B. Mitchell—to Mr. Holdshjp is announced, the marriage
to take place shortly.
Yours affectionately,

“The Long Strike,” by the late Dion
Boucicault, now running at Her Majesty's- a
play of about 30 years’ standing—affords another
proof of that prolific author’s ability to build an
attractive drama by the aid of powerful dialogue
and sensational situations around a simple or
perhaps, improbable story. Everybody is glad to
see William Rignold once more; his fine character-
performance of the secretive, mind-vexed opera-
tive, Noah Learoyd, is in strong contrast to hi s
natural impersonation of the crusty, prosperous
warm-hearted lawyer, Moneypenny. All the
other parts are well filled. The Jane of Roland
Watts-Phillips is a good performance; Harry
Jewett gives a manly reading of Jem Starkie-
Arthur Greenaway, as the unprincipled mill'
owner, does not give way to his usual tendency to
chant in parts of this character, and is therefore
all right; and “Jack” Sweeney, as Johnny
Reilly the part created by Boucicault—is fitted
to the skin. The realistic scene, in which he
professedly pendant from an upright with other
mails in a post-bag, is swept off by the mail-train
as it thunders by, is sensational enough for any-
thing. Were it not that the strike is at length
beginning to exert an evil influence on things
financial, a long run might be predicted for
Long Strike.”

“Chilperic,” magnificently staged and
accoutred at Sydney Royal—as well, indeed, as
anything of its kind that has preceded it, if not
better—is the badly-told tale of an amorous
monarch, a frail maiden and a complaisant lover
into which all sorts of unneccessary and puruose-
less persons are introduced. " The libretto
bald and pointless, differs from the transla-
tions used here and elsewhere, previously.
The music, by Herve, as a rule bright and
sparkling, lacks uniformity, and fails in some
instances to fit the subject, and the songs, through
defective enunciation, possibly, seldom carry
on the story. The show is of the leg
leggy, and the management evince a determina-
tion to put their best leg foremost by the
engagements of quadrupeds, an indifferently white
horse and a particularly headstrong donkey, to
support the bipeds. The fair manageress as
Fredegonde makes the most of the few shows that
bob about in an ocean of undiluted tommyrot,
and has almost given up that irritating head-
tossing so reminiscent of a horse on a bearing-rein
worried by flies. In the name-part, Woodfield,
who acts with animation, sings acceptably the
Horse and Butterfly songs and in a duet with
Nellie Stewart, but even with a little more voice
he wouldn’t drown the orchestra. Snazelle. one
of four alleged comedians, as Dr. Senna, gets his
first decent vocal show, and “ As a Physician” is
encored nightly. Johnny Gourlay, attired like
Baron Scar pi a and made up like Henry Irving,
whose mannerisms fie imitates, by way of Spanish,
has a horrid lot of gibberish to jabber and
shows to best advantage in a couple of dances,
Of the others Johnny Wallace is persistently
funny at the wrong moment, and George Leitch
got the “bird” on opening night for an atrociously
feeble song, interlarded with vulgarities, which
has since been withdrawn. In small parts Bessie
Royal apd \ era Patey do. not wholly paralyse the
audience; Aggie Kelton and her sister, Belle
Lindsay, are fetching, and Syd. Deane is leaderof
a crowd of Dan-O’Connorish Druids who should
be eliminated, and are introduced merely to sing
choruses more suitable to a serious work. The
feature of the show, artistically considered, is
Gordon’s scenery : ’the woodland scene is lovely,,
thy perspective and colouring of the throne-room
scene admirable, and the tower scene of the last
act, with revolving turret, is also good. The
ballet-dancing, to the tune-of gay Mabille, cancan
melodies, is more than passable. Anyhow, thanks-
to the persistent drilling of Stage-manager Wal-
lace, it is superior to any of the company’s pre-
vious efforts in this line.

After a month’s run, “ Dandy D'.-jk” wilt
be scratched for Sydney Criterion Stakes on
Saturday next, chiefly because the assistance of
Messrs. Cathcayt and Cates is required at the

Spectacles,” which succeeds, is the adaptation
from Labiche and Delacour’s “ Les Petit Oiseaux,”
by Frank Grundy, which has been running for
several months at the London. Garrick.

The best thing to be said in connection
with the Achurch benefit at Sydney Criterion is
that over £l5O remains on the credit side of the
hon. sec.’s accounts. Tep rows of staffs were
filled at circle prices, the circle was full to over-
flowing, and the upper benches fairly filled. The
beneficiary’s “ Camille ” was good, but the voice
was over-vigorous in- the last act, where the
standing-up death apd heavy faff were anything
but natural, though an enthusiast evinced a desire
for its repetition by, yelling “ encore’’most lustily.

Charrington company as soubrette) as Nichette,.

At Sydney Centennial Hall, audiences
have not been what an artist of Madame Patey’s

bility, but the great feature of her vocalisation is.

pathos. Those who attribute the occasional)
failure of visiting artistes to draw great houses to.
the predominance of classical music on their pro-,,
grammes, are robbed of an old wheeze in this in-
stance, for the cantatrice, so , far, has sung only
one aria and five old ballads on each evening, and'
the company have followed suit. However, had)
Madame Patey started to sing nothing but,
classical ditties, it is impossible to say what-
might have happened, A great feature of
the show is the presence of “ special ushers,”

him we sigh for Best. He plays again next Satur-

“Ours,” which attracted the usual crowd
to Melbourne Bijou on Saturday night, is weaker
in plot, character, and dialogue than any other of
Robertson’s successes. Its interest lies nowhere
in particular, and even the glamour of the author’s
graceful style cannot conceal the absurdity of bis
fast act. The heroine is a colourless little tulip,
conveying a general impression that she intends to
throw over her feller in favour of a shrivelled
foreign object, with two coats of whitewash on
his face, until the sound of a drum causes her to
faint out of the difficulty. Then there is a heavy
military father, who sacrifices his domestic peace
rather than hurt the feelings of his aggravating
old hen of a wife. Nobody accepts this noble
warrior as a genuine article, because nobody else
in the world would honor bills forged by his
brother-in-law, merely out of regard for such a
wife. Again, there is the languid Piccadilly idler
who, suddenly awakening to the necessity of having
a great object in life, can think of nothing
greater than a commission in the army. “ Ours ”
is hardly a comedy to ruminate upon with pleasure.
The little, very little taste it leaves on the palate
is not sweet. But being a “good style” affair,
and well suited to the B. and B. company, “Ours”
will appeal mildly to the understanding of all who
haven’t very much to appeal to. Titheradge and
Miss Romer come, perhaps, nearer to perfection
in their parts than anyone else, although Pattie
Browne has never seemed brighter, or less self
conscious. Lyndall, too, is losing some of his air
of having been intended for a curacy, and Emma
Temple, always natural and nice, grows more
effective and stage-filling. G. P. Carey makes
something of Sergeant Jones, and Lawrence is
only a little too a xfnl as the henpecked slaughter-
man, . while Boucioault’s background figure of
the Russian Prince is evidently our old friend
Borowski, escaped from the “ Glass of Fashion,”
The opening scene received what would have been
an encore in the case of a song or dance.

“Maritana,” at Melbourne Royal, may be
summed up in one bitter snort. The company
which Si monsen has gathered together cannot
stand the test of invidious comparison at any
point of the proceedings, and nothing short of the
Bank of England could keep them going for long.
Elsa May’s acting is several degrees less ravishing
than her singing, and if the prima donna con-
sented to let her hearers off with fewer ballads,
they would be grateful for her clemency. Percy
Shannon possesses the qualifications necessary for
a representation of Don Jose in the baek-blocks,
which is more than can be said for some of the
others. Two members of this gloomy constella-
tion made a first appearance in Melbourne on
Saturday. The Lazarillo was a Miss Dora Busch,
who may improve after a severe course of training,
and the Don Csesar turned,up in the raw youthful
person of Jules Simonsen. In a pictorial sense,
young Sinlonsen’s performance of Don Csesar may
bo fairly described as an insult to any civilised
community. The aspirant is a lean, small-sized
boy, whose acting of what is a very difficult
character (as such things go) calls for pity, rather
than auger. That Martin Simonsen’s son knows
how to sing goes without mentioning, but as he
lacks strength of tenor voice at present, and is,
moreover, unable to speak his lines as intelligently
as a parrot, he had better run away and grow, and
practise everything he can think of, not forgetting
deportment, before cutting a pathetic figure in
any more operas. Orchestra and chorus, although
rough and noisy, are the least unsatisfactory
features of a positively hopeless failure. At
time of writing “Maritana” was advertised
to run until Saturday next, when “II Trova-
tore” was to be produced, but Mr. Simonsen
had better buy a new company first. His con-
tempt for press opinion, and his belief in the
ability of the public to know a good entertainment
when they find one, are notorious. After tho
public have stopped away from “Maritana” the
impressario may conclude that this is a bad enter-
tainment. Ridiculously bad, in point of fact.

“London, Day by Day,” has caught on
nicely at the Alexandra, where the first week’s
audiences were, in the advertisement-language,
"prodigious, considering inclement weather.” A
large show like this naturally improves with
repetition, and now it is more than deserving of
the jam so liberally ladled-out last week.

“ Uncle Toni’s Cabin ” will last for another
week, apparently, at the Opera House, but
“Mikado,” which has done big business through-
out, is about to quit the Princess’s in favor of
“La Mascotte,” with Ataggie Moore as the luck-
purveyor. Texas Jack makes his first Melbourne
appearance at the Exhibition to-day (Thursday)
in scenes of “ American Wild Frontier Life.” A
bile hippodrome track has been laid down in the
and there is an impression abroad that
Hwiistou, Son & Lyons intend to make matters
bum with no uncertain sound. At the halls, &c.,
sufficient money keeps steadily rolling in.

An actress took a benefit the other day—

Performance lasted four hours, and the stage-
hands, who had volunteered their services and had
beep -ciO the premises since early morning, got both

booze,” and, like the inferior performers, they had
to refresh themselves with the sounds of popping
corks in the dressing-room where the committee
and swell professionals were regaled.

The Potter-Bellew season at the Adelaide
Royal continues to be exceptionally brilliant, and
the management have nightly to turn crowds away
for want of seating accommodation. “Frou
Frou ” has been followed by “The Lady of
Lyons ” and “Mdlle. de Bressier.” Mrs. Potter’s
gorgeous garments have caused consternation
amongst the fair sex, and unfortunate husbands
have lately been confronted with huge milliners’
bills as a result of an endeavour on the part of
their expensive spouses to live up to the fail-
actress’s standard of clothing. Judging from
productions on view on the block, the local
modiste will not outrival the reputation of the
famous Mr. Worth of Paris. Hugo’s Minstrels,
just strengthened by the appearance of George
Jones, are doing capital business at Garner’s

Lincoln was to play at Terang, but at the last

doors, and (this is where the fun came in) the

more than was received. The doorkeeper, a local
man, had admitted a few on the nod, and these
latter demanded “their money back” as vigor-
ously as the others. None of Frank’s own jokes
are equal to this.

Centennial Hall on Monday evening. Best, the
house-filler, was absent, nevertheless over 2000
people assembled and everyone was delighted,
especially the entrepreneur, who cleared enough to
pay the company’s travelling expenses. Marian
Burton was in grand form, and her fine sym-
pathetic voice never showed to better advantage
than in her oratorio selections. Henry Stock-
well, our leading tenor, was in more robust voice
than we have hitherto heard him,' and Miss
Colbourne-Baber sang with great taste and fresh--

friends and patrons, unable to obtain entrance to her
pupils’ concert, through the ill-advised action of “ some
of those to whom invitations were sent, who thoughtlessly
brought ten, fifteen, and even twenty friends with them,
a circumstance which I could not foresee, and which I
deeply regret.”
Charles Cartwright, an actor of much experience*
especially in “heavies,” comes out as a “star” under
engagement to \V. and G. He brings with him an adap-
tation of “LeDrapeau.”
“P.Q.R.” writes to the Sydney Daily Telegraph
suggesting that the city fathers should provide foot-rests
at the Centennial Hall—a want suggested to him by the
fact that “a lady has been kind enough to place both her
feet on the rung of my chair, and by a species of mind-
reading I could discern her appreciation of the evening’s
performance.” This is mind-reading extraordinary, and
it causes one to have forebodings as to the location of
“ P.Q.R.’s” seat of reason.
There was a splendid house for Mila’s “ben.,”
at Melbourne Bijou, his reception nearly lifted the roof
off, and after he had spoken feelingly of his debts of
gratitude and money to public friends and private
creditors several sympathetic ladies went weeping forth
into the night air. Miln was justified in making special
mention of the “gallery boy, who had ever been his
friend,” for it is no small thing to have brought Shake-
speare home to the hearts of football barrackers.
The Sydney Eight Hours’ Procession this
year numbered fully 16,000 men. At the picnic
not a single act of violence took place, and not a
drunken man was to be seen. So much for the
ruffianism of Australian Trades-Unionism.
The appointment of the Countess of
Jersey to the Governorship of New South Wales
is (says the Dublin Freeman’s Journal) an
experiment for which Salisbury deserves the
gratitude of the advocates of women’s rights. Of
course the Constitution requires that formally the
post should be conferred on the Earl of Jersey.
But everyone knows that for all practical purposes
his better half will be the real ruler of the colony.
Even as a figure-head for State and social occa-
sions, Lord Jersey cannot be regarded as the
ideal thing. He is descended from the bold
bad Duke of Buckingham, and strongly re-
sembles the Rev. Mr. Stiggins, with the
addition of long hay-coloured Dundreary whiskers,
not inaptly termed “weepers.” His manner of
speaking is in accord with his appearance, and
consists of lugubrious drawl. His wife is very
high in the hierarchy of the Primrose League, and
pretty well “bosses” the central organisation,
managing the dames directly, and the knights in-
directly, through her husband. The Jersey family
having the reputation of being rich, the only
possible explanation of the appointment is the
desire of Lady Jersey to exercise her superfluous
energy in some more practical field than is afforded
by the Primrose League. But how will the
colonists like it ?

Her Majesty (yawning). —“ And now, as it is
a wet day and we can’t take the horses out, sup-
pose we talk about some subject that will improve
our minds. I command you, Albert Edward
(looking at theP. of W.) to suggest something.”
The P. of W. (after a mighty mental effort in the
course of which the blood rushes into his head and a
Lord-in-Watting approaches and puts a block of ice
on the back of his neck). —“ The next Derby ? ”
Her Majesty. —“ H’m. No. We are tired of
hearing of it. It seems to me there is nothing
but racing talked about in this family.”
The Duke of Cambridge. —“ Der Army ?”
The younger members of the Royal Family
snigger, and the P. of W. winks slyly at Batten-
berg who sits at the far end of the room twisting
Ids moustache.
Her • Majesty (drily). —“After recent occur-
rences, I think you had better not talk about the
Army, uncle. My grandson, the Emperor William,
tells me that you couldn’t pass an examination for
a corporalship in his Army.”
The Duke of Cambridge (flushing purple ). —
“ Matam, it is a galumny. Vat doos dot arrogant
pqy know about var ? Yen I was in der Crimea
Her Majesty (severely).—“We have heard that
story before, sir. I thought that hallucination
had been dispelled. ”
The Duke of Fife to the P. op W. (in a
whisper). —“ What is the story,-sir?”
The P. of W. (also in a whisper). —“Hasn’t he
told you yet? Perhaps you haven’t been long
enough in the family. Well, t he old fellow has a
craze like that Uncle George
the Fourth had about Water
100, and fancies he led the
Charge of the Light Brigade
at Balaclava. It’s very funny,
but, of course, you won’t
mentionit outside. I wouldn’t
like the comic papers to get
hold of it. We are ridicul-
ous enough as it is.”
The Princess op Wales.
“ The Church, mamma ?’*
Her Majesty (smiling
ruefully). —“ I think we had
better not talk about that
subject either. Although I
am Head of the Church, the
Lord’s Day Observance So-
ciety object to my having
thrown open the East Ter-
race on Sundays for the
people to walk there and
listen to the band playing.
They sent me a letter about
it the other day. Sir Henry
Pym.sonby has it. Ring for
Sir Henry, one of you. ”
Sir Henry enters presently,
with a jicii behind each ear,
receives Her Majesty’s in-
structions, and returns with
the letter.
Her Majesty.— “l’ll only
read you one sentence. The
remainder of the composition
is too dreary. Listen : ‘ The
arranging of attractive
amusements on the Lord’s
Day cannot but hinder the
efforts of Christian persons
to instruct the young and
to win to holiness multitudes
who are ignorant of the
Gospel, and who stand in
sore need of instruction in the truths of God’s
holy word. 5 ”
Princess Louise of Lorne to the P. op W. —
“ I hey’re very hard on the Royal Family. I think
they aim mostly at you, though.”
Her Majesty. —“lsn’t there any other subject
you can suggest?”
The P. of W. (impulsively).— “ The Stage.”
Her Majesty. —“ Albert Edward! Be good
enough to remember where you are.”
The P. op W. —“l ask pardon, mother. I
forgot that you have a prejudice against the
stage. ”
Her Majesty (in a hollow whisper, heard only
by the P, of W.). —“ If I have it is on your
account, unhappy boy.”
* # #
The Duchess of Albany (hesitatingly). —“We
might converse about the famine in Ireland. The
pooali.people must suffer dreadfully.”
Her Majesty (sharply). —“I have done my
<mty. 1 have sent a cheque for £2 2s. out of my
little savings to alleviate the distress. Let us
consider that subject settled, if you please.”
Princess Battenberg. —“lt would, perhaps,,
be more-interesting, mamma, if we spoke about
that old Scotch person near Balmoral to whom
you gave a Bible and a flannel petticoat ?”
Her Majesty (with effusion). —“Dear old
creature ! Yes, we will speak of her. I remember
one morning,” &o.
The P. of W. to Princess Louise.—“ This
will never do. If the Old Lady gets on to that
subject she’ll talk for a week. Suggest something
else, Louise.”
Princess Louise (aloud). —“Whydoesn’t Alfred
tell us something about the Navy? He’s an
Admiral of the Fleet, and outfit to know some-
thing about his profession.”
The P. of W. to the Duke of Fife.— “ Alfred
couldn’t navigate a ferry boat without a sailing
master. Haw ! Haw !”
The Duke op Fife (very faintly.— “ Haw !
Haw!”
Princess Louise. — “He hesitates. Perhaps
he knows more about the fiddle. Let him, then,
hold forth on the fiddle.”
Prince Battenberg.—“ Ja wohl. Let him blay
mit der viddle.”
Princess Battenberg.— “ Be quiet, Bat. Keep
your place.”
The Duke of Edinburgh (sourly). “We
kilow Louise monopolises all the brains of the
family; perhaps she will instruct us concerning
Canada. They adore her in Canada.”
Princess Louise. —“ They didn’t shoot at me,
anyhow, as they did at you in Australia.”
The P. op W.—“ That was an error. They mis-
took him for a wild Duke—wild duck, you know.
Haw ! Haw!”
Her Majesty (severely). —“Albert Edward!
This is not a minstrel entertainment.” Thinks
for a moment, and then continues — “As Aus-
tralia has been mentioned, and I have heard a
good deal of it lately, we will talk about Australia.
What do you know about it, Alfred ? You have
been there.”
The Duke of Edinburgh (still sulky)—“ Yaas,
1 was there. The trip cost me several pounds in
presents I gave away.”
The P. of W.—“ Yaas. You were very free-
handed, I believe. Oarington told me in a letter
I got from him some time ago that at a station he
visited they showed him an aluminium watch with
imitation works and your name and titles upon it,
which you had given to the eldest son when you
were there. They keep it under a glass-case with
a shilling which you gave to the butler when you
left.”
The Duke of Edinburgh. —“ You may sneer as
you like, but the daughters of one wealthy Aus-
tralian —he was a South Australian, if I remember
rightly—thought so much of me that they asked
me to give them my nail-parings to wear in
lockets.”
Her Majesty. “Touching exhibition of
loyalty! You gratified them, of course?”
The Duke of Edinburgh. —“ I did, mother.”
The Duchess of Edinburgh. —“ Idiots !”
THE PROPOSED NEW SYDNEY P.O. CARVINGS.
Princess Louise (suavely) —“Not necessarily,
my dear. No doubt they wanted them to wear as
amulets against Improvidence.”
# * »
Her Majesty. —“ Can you throw any light on
this subject, Albert Edward ?”
The P. of W.—“ The only man, barring Car-
ington, / know in Australians Teddy Davies, and
he says
Her Majesty. —“ And who is the gentleman
you honour by such familiar allusions? An
eminent colonial statesman, I suppose ?”
r The P. of W. ( bashfully) —“No, mother.
Teddy’s a ventriloquist, but we are great friends.
I never do anything of importance without first
consulting Teddy. It was he who advised me not
to go out to Australia a year ago when it was sug- ’
gested that I should go. He said there wasn’t
money enough in the tour just then. But I’m
astonished that you don’t seem to know him.
Her Majesty (sadly) —“ There are times when
I think it almost a pity that you should have been
born a prince, Albert Edward. Your tastes are
deplorably bad, and I am told you are never so
happy as when you are behind the scenes at a
theatre.”
Duke of Connaught (aside)—“ Ballet!”
The P. of W. (lifting his eyebrows) —“What is
that bald man saying?”"
Princess Louise (demurely) —“He says he
would give all the military glory he is ever likely
to gain for a reliable hair-restorer.”
The P. of W.—“ Wants one for nothing, as
usual. It is a way members of this family have.
But (addressing the company) from what I hear it
is quite possible to live in the Australian colonies.
Of course there is no society there, but that isn’t
the fault of the poor colonist. lam told that the
manner in which they fall down and worship
persons of rank is is very funny.”
Her Majesty.— “ Very proper, you mean. Of
course their civilisation is inferior, and they know
it.”
The P. of W. —“ Inferior , mother? They have
the best racecourse in the world. Joe Thompson
told me (pauses suddenly and blushes with con-
fusion) I mean Bishop Moorhouse informed me.”
Her Majesty (austerely) —“That will do,
Albert Edward. Prevarication is unworthy even
of you. I wish to hear nothing more about
racing.”
The P. of W. (sullenly) —“ Well, mother,
Oarington tells me that if it weren’t for the
racing he’d have yawned himself to death out
there years ago. Albert and George were there.
Perhaps they can tell you something about the
place.”
Prince Albert op Wales. —“ Vulgah, vewy.”
Prince George of Wales. —“ They gave a ball
in our honour when we were there.”
Prince A. of W. —“Yaas, and a dweadful wed-
faced man—Mayah of the wetched place, I think
—shook hands with me and said he would nevah
wash his hand again or do any work with it if he
had to see it become slowly pawalysed.”
* # •
Her Majesty (thoughtfully)—“There was a
Colonial Person presented to me some time ago.
He bad a very red face, if I recollect aright.”
Princess Louise. —“Yes, mamma, and red
hands with hair on them, and no finger-nails.”
Her Majesty. —“ Are all Australians like that,
George ?”
Prince G. ofW. (gravely). —“ All distinguished
Australians, grandmamma. But the girls are
jolly. One of them wanted to run away with me.
Hhe said ”
The P. of W. (sternly). —“George, leave the
room !”
Exit P. G, of W. with his tongue in his cheele.
* * *
The Duke of Edinburgh (after a pause).—
“That history-fellow, Froude, has been to the
colonies and written a book about them. He
might know something.”
Princess Louise. —“Poor little Froude! He
wouldn’t know about anything outside of the
Government Houses if he could help it.”
Her Majesty.— “lsn’t there a person in the
Commons whom they call the member for Aus-
tralia ?”
The P, of W.—“Yaas”— (in derision). “He
has been pointed out to me.”
Her Majesty. —“ What sort of person is the
person ?”
The P. of W. shudders and makes a wry face.
O.mnes. —“Ah !”
The P. of W.—“ YaaS ! But some of the
Agents-General are very decent persons in their
station in life and exceedingly loyal, though
terrible bores. If they owned the colonies, mother,
instead of merely representing them, they would
give them to you to-morrow for a stock-farm, or
to present to Battenberg there if you would ask
them to dine hero occasionally and allow them to
sleep over the stables now and then. ”
Her Majesty. —“ I have heard so—but, of
course, there are some things that cannot be done.
The servants would object if I allowed these
persons to come about the place much. 1 believe
they are very fond of titles. Perhaps I may
establish a new Order for their benefit one of these
days.”
Princess Louise. —“ Let it bo a gorgeous one,
then, mamma, with a star as large as a soup-plate
and a ribbon as broad as a sash and of a colour
that will scream at people as they pass. They’ll
call it the Silken Bond that binds the Colonies to
the Empire.”
Her Majesty (settling herself comfortably on her
throne).— “ As none of you seem to know much
about my Australian Colonies, I will tell you what
f have found out about them myself from my
advisers. My subjects there worship me and my
family—it is well they don’t know as much about
some of you as I do—especially my subjects of
Melbourne, in Queensland, who are'more enthu-
siastic than those of Sydney, in South Australia,
and sent a troop of soldiers under the command of
a Mr. Malley, whom I made a Privy Councillor
afterwards, to help my army in the Soudan. They
are all earnest Imperialists, poor things, and are
terribly afraid of being separated from the Crown,
and their great ambition is to have a member of
my family sent out to govern them. They are, of
course, too rude and uncultured now for me to
gratify their desire in that direction, but in the
course of time, when they become more civilised,
I might, if one of you happened to become broken
down in health or mentally indisposed, like our
poor, dear ancestor, George the Third, send him
out to them as a Governor-General, in care of Sir
Henry Parker, or Sharker, who, I am informed
is a leading aboriginal in Adelaide.”
The P. of W.—“ Send Connaught, mother—
Ac s tit for the position without any preparation. ”
The Duke of Connaught.— “l’m not painfully
fat, at any rate, Wales.”
The P. of W.—“ Only in the head, deai
brother—only in the head, and the heat of the
climate might carry away some of that.”
Her Majesty. —“ What is that paper you are
trying to hide, Prince Battenberg ?”
Prince Battenberg.—“The Sydney Bulletin
your Majesty. Louise lent it to me. There’s ■!
funny story in it about Beatrice. ”
Her Majesty (haughtily). —“ Do you subscribe
to this journal, Louise?”
Princess Louise.— “l am its Windsor corres
pondent, mother.”

Another Great Win!
AN INVALID FOR 12 YEARS.
Mrs. Fanny Dent, wife of a gentleman em-
ployed in the Lambton Collieries, kindly allows
us to publish the following facts of her interesting
case and wonderful recovery, which we gather
from her correspondence, and which we shall ba
glad to allow anyone to peruse who wishes to do
so.
Mrs. Dent had been in a state of extreme
debility for twelve years, frequently quite
unable to do any work, the lightest kind causing
great fatigue, with severe pains in the limbs, back
and left side. So severe was the pain that she
would have to sit or lie down frequently. Walk-
ing exercise was very trying and she could only
walk very slowly. She had long seen Clements
Tonic advertised, but like many more people her
husband was prejudiced against “patent medi-
cines,” but (now we use her own words) “I know
someone who had tried Clements Tonic, and 1
decided to get a bottle on the quiet and say
nothing about it if it did me no good. The effect
I thought something wonderful. I felt bettor
after the first dose, and by the time I had taken
half a bottle I was a different woman. My
husband, friends and neighbours soon noticed the
change in me, and they could not make it out. I
had to tell the truth that it was Clements Tonic
that was making me strong, I could not keep the
secret, I was only too glad to give the credit to
Clements Tonic. After finishing the bottle, work
was no trouble to me, but rather a pleasure, and
after doing a heavy day’s washing 1 could go for
a walk instead of having to go to bed, as always
happened before taking Clements Tonic. One of
my neighbours said to me last week, ! Why, Mrs.
Dent, you are doing wonders this week, how is
it you are so strong now ? She knew I had done
more that week than I had been able to do in 12
years before (Aie had known me this time for I
am an old resident of this locality, having lived
here for 15 years.) I replied, "‘Yes, I feel a
wonder to myself, so I’ll tell you the secret, 1
have been taking Clements Tonic, and I cannot
tell you the benefit t have derived from it. You
know' wdiat my sufferings have been and now I
have a genuine taste of good health.’”
Mrs. Dent wrote us those particulars of her
remarkable cure in March. She wisely, however
decided to continue the medicine to “clinch the
cure” as it were. Some time afterwards she
wrote as follows :
Waratah Commonage, N.S.W.
Dear Sir,—lt is with great pleasure that I pen
these few lines. I have been as you know a great
sufferer from weakness and debility for years. I
was under several doctors, but they never did any
good. I despaired of ever being better, but as I
stated in my last letter I saw Clements Tonic
advertised. I tried a bottle and its effect was
something wonderful. I felt better almost imme-
diately, and was a new woman after finishing the
first bottle. Before taking Clements Tonic it was
a great trouble even to do a little house-work, but
after wards my work was a pleasure and my
friends and neighbours were surprised at the
change in me. I cannot say too much in praise ot
it, and can only gratefully describe my case and
strongly advise all who suffer from weakness,
backache, pain in the side, ringing noises in the
cars and shortness of breath to take Clements
Tonic. I feel sure it will do them as much good
as it has done me.
Yours Gratefully,
FANNY DENT.
e have great pleasure in thanking this lady
for allowing us to publish the ease. We constantly
hear of similar ones which people object to have
published through a false delicacy. \Ve only want
to publish them in the interests of suffering
humanity. Surely it is not wrong for people to
acknowledge the genuineness and reliability of an
article, when they have proved it to possess the
properties we claim fur it.

The Guildford (Eng.) Board of Guardians
has resolved that no letter addressed to a pauper
with the title “Mr,” or “Mrs.” on it shall be
delivered until the offending epithet is scored
out. The British citizen, when he is old and hard-
up, must have his letters directed “Pauper Smith,
the Workus.”
Old Johnny Fawkner noticed in Victoria
that the first hot-wind day of the Australian sum-
mer fixes the character of the season. If the
change is rain, rain follows every hot wind ; if a
cool south-wester and no rain, this continues
throughout the summer. The 12th of September
this year was the first hot wind of the season, and
was followed by rain.

It is officially denied that the Duke of

At the inaugural meeting of the N.S.W.
Cornish Association, the other night, the vice-
chairman, by way of giving his land a lift, pointed
out that it had already given birth to thirty-three

most of his audience bowed their heads in
shame.
One of the most striking spectacles known
to science is Explorer Stanley when he sits
down and expectorates for five yards in every

has become a speciality.
Mr. James Torpy, M.P., has been elected
president of the newly-formed Newspaper Press
Association of N.S.W. One of the objects of the

has already grabbed from the taxpayers no less
than three million pounds sterling. Yet the
Duke did not think it his duty to “plant” his
mother.
Alphonse Karr, French novelist, has just
died, aged 82. Most people thought he had long
since joined Moliere, Balzac, and the other great
Frenchmen who occupied the 41st fauteuil amid
the 40 big-wigs of the Academic —that is to say,
were not thought worthy of election in their
life-time. Karr is only remembered for his ex-
quisite conversational wit and his “ Tour Round
My Garden.”
A provincial journal says that bushranger
Thunderbolt, who was supposed to have been shot
by Trooper —now Sub-Inspector—Walker, is not
dead, nor yet doth he sleep, but is alive and well,
and enjoys life as an honest farmer in N.S.W.
The man shot is said to have been a drunken
looney who said he was Thunderbolt out of
bravado, and lost his life for his temerity. In
Darlinghurst gaol doing 15 years, eight of which
have passed by, is Mr. John Thompson, known as
“Thunderbolt’s Boy,” who could, if he chose,
elucidate matters.
The real name of the late Father Damien
was De Yersue. Dr. Hyde, of San Francisco, in
his latest letter returns to the charge, and says
that Damien, “before going to Molokai had
charge of two other parishes, where it is believed
he contracted the disease, and left behind him an
unsavoury reputation. There is no doubt about
his zeal and activity in his work, but the mere
circumstance of his being a leper, or taking up his
residence at the settlement, gives him no claim to
the position assigned him as pre-eminent among
those who have done good to their fellowmen.
Other Catholic priests have had the leprosy and
gone to Molokai, but they could not live with
Damien. They quarrelled, threw stones, and
cursed each other in the public road. Damien
did not die from some fatal development of
leprosy. The immediate cause of his death was
an attack of pneumonia, for which he refused to
take the remedies prescribed by the physician.”

.Reynolds’ proposes to raise a fund to
purchase an annuity of £l5O per annum for John
Burns to enable him to devote his time to the

independent for life.
Mr. W. T. Carter, M.L.A. for Williams-
town, and the perennial president of the Melbourne
“Strike’’mass meetings, was once a preacher of
the Christian gospel—generally interpreted to be
a Gospel of Content. Now, he is an apostle of the
great Gospel of Discontent.
It is said that the Melbourne importers
were so determined to put a stop to the strike as
the only salvation against their ruin that they
brought pressure to bear on the Employers’ Union,
hence the conciliatory tone adopted by the latter
body in the new proposals.
The Austrians are alleged by cable to have
given German Emperor William a triumphal recep-
tion, for no better reason, apparently, than that
William’s grandpa made their country bleed freely
in 1860. There never was any logical way of
accounting for a royal welcome.
One member of the N.S.W. Assembly has
a. Parliamentary vote in each of 27 _ N.S.W.
electorates. That is to say, he is politically, on
the mere basis of his voting power, leaving his
money influence out of the question, 27 times as
powerful as the ordinary labourer.
The Sydney dailies, by way of pointing a
moral, talk of “ the peaceful and proper methods
by which the Eight-hours System was achieved.”
The fact is, of course, that the Eight-hours’ System
is a monument of a long and weary war—of strikes
and boycottings and locks-out in this and older
lands.
Is the Commission appointed to inquire
into the state of the N.S.W. Government offices
working for the information of individual Ministers
or for that of the country ? If for the latter, how
is it that its reports are kept so secret ? Where is
the report, for instance, on the N.S.W. Post-
Office department ?
That excited glazier, Fish, M.P. for
Dunedin (N.Z.), broke out in a new spot lately.
He was just invoking what he called the “ (furse
of the Almighty” on the Railway department
when the Speaker interposed and made him take
it back. After a warm remonstrance Fish sadly
folded up his anathema and carried it down the
street. *
Now listen, ye Sydney Trades-unionists.
Men with bad records have no right to jump into
representative positions, for they transfer the
odium of their record to those whom they repre-
sent. If you must make use of a rogue or a
humbug, don’t advertise him at your own expense.
It is like advertising that you are proud of Having
contracted leprosy.
If the N.S.W. Democratic party are so
foolish as to support any would-be member of
Parliament who more than once a week drunkenly
rolls up the street, hooking at women’s feet with a
crooked walking-stick and smashing men’s Hats
over their eyes, they deserve to die the death.
Let them send to Parliament neither drunkards
nor men with obvious brain-lesions.
Bishop Goe took a milder tone than was
expected, in commending the strike to the notice
of the Victorian Church Assembly, the other day.
Last time he slashed into the London dock
strikers, and groaned over the poor shareholders,
but he democratises visibly, like Hopetoun. Now
he exalts “ free ” labour, and when the next synod
comes round he may be found putting the Rev.
Boycott Blackleg into a white choker.
Let not the workmen of N.S.W. forget
that the leaders of the so-called N.S.V . Freetrade
and Liberal Association, headed by Treasurer
M'Millan, deliberately opposed in conference, the
inclusion in their programme of the One-Man-
One-Vote principle. That fact, which can easily
be verified on reference to the daily-press reports
of this big Freetrade Conference, is an ample test
of the sincerity of the present attitude of the
Parkes Government upon Hie question. |
R. C. Luscombe, writing to the S.M.
Herald, points out that the N.S.W. Freehold
and Pastoral Association—an institution formed
for the purpose of exterminating free-selectprs —
had in their articles of association, six years ago, a
clause reading thus ; “ No shareholder shall be at
liberty to call upon the committee (15) for any
account of their expenditure of the funds of the
association, and the committee may plead this
deed as a bar to any action, suit, claim or demand
which may be made upon them by any share-
holder.” No honest enterprise, argues Luscombe,
would ever confer such powers.
The Melbourne Age fitly describes lawyers
as constituting “the most stringent and unreason-
able Trades-union that was ever formed—a union
that charges an extravagant entrance-fee, boycotts
all non-unionists, keeps up the rate of wages at
the highest possible point, opposes the amalgama-
tion of work, and only abstains from general
strikes because it recognises the danger of allow-
ing society to discover how easily it could dispense
with the services of this particular craft.” The
Age might have added—And which often shame-
lessly and fraudulently pockets and retains the
said highest wages without even pretending to
perform the work for which such wages are
claimed.
Chief Justice Higinbotham having given
£5O to the Victorian strike-fund, and promised to
give £lO a week so long as the Employers’ Union
refuses to meet the workmen in conference, the
Victorian legal profession has, it is rumoured, as
a protest promised to contribute an equal amount
to the Employers’ Union, so long as the Chief
Justice shall continue to support the strike-fund.
But such a donation from the associated lawyers
would not balance that of the Chief Justice, for as
the typical lawyer is undisguisedly the political
enemy of the man who lives by manual labour, his
gift to the top dog would be regarded as a mere
matter of course. The moral effect of Judge
Higinbotham's action would have been the same
had he contributed a sovereign against fifty thou-
sand pounds given by the federated law-sharks.
Mr. Crick, M.P. (N.S.W.), whose wind-
pipe Mr. Hurley, M.P., lately threatened to
“ pull out,” has just—such is the force of bad ex-
ample planted in congenial soil—threatened to
pull out the windpipe of Mr. John Haynes, M.P.
We don’t admire Mr. Haynes’ politics any more
than we admire Mr. Crick’s methods, but as we
are of a sporting disposition we are ready to wager
any moderate amount that Mr. Crick cannot pull
out Mr. Haynes’ windpipe, and we are further
prepared to bet that if these two eminent legis-
lators be looked in a room unaccompanied and
unarmed, to fight to a finish, and one only to come
out alive, the live one will be Mr. Haynes, who,
when he emerges, will be playing “The Wind
Among the Barley,” or some such inspiriting Irish
melody upon the gory trachea of the late Mr.
Crick, M.P. Of course this offer is subject to the
passing of a Crick-Haynes Choking Indemnity
Act, which might or might not receive the joyful
and immediate assent of both Houses and the
Crown.

Society
It is understood that a leading N.S.W.
politician has just been divorced in camera. From
all we have heard he is thoroughly entitled to the
release, and has throughout behaved to his erring
wife in a most generous and manly way. All the
same, it is time that divorces in camera were
abolished, or made universal in the interests of
public morality, which is apt to get badly smirched
by the perusal of the salacious reports lovingly
ladled out by slum-raking afternoon papers. The
class to which John Smith, the blacksmith’s
striker, belongs, are handed over as bound vic-
tims to the press, and if it be a good thing for the
parties divorced and the public that certain cases
should be heard privately then the custom should
be made general; the newspapers being furnished
with no information but the names of those con
cerned and the result of the inquiry.
* * ' «
“Ah,” said a man with wild frenzy in his
eye, as he rushed among the crowd in front of the
Sydney City Bank early on the morning of the
great fire, “ are all the documents safe? ” “ Yes,
thank Heaven,” replied an unctuous director
rolling his fat eyes towards the skies. “ Thank
Satan,” said the frenzied man, “those accursed
bills of mine are not burnt, after all. ”
# * *
The big Sydney fire cost £700,000. It
was well worth the money; for it made people
say nothing about the strike for pretty nearly four
hours.
* * *
Another good point about the Sydney
£700,000 conflagration was the opportunity it
afforded certain Sydney pressmen of smothering
their internal bonfires with a really first-class
article, the salvage Perrier and Jouet of the
Athenaeum Club’s cellar. Which, perhaps,
accounts for the incoherency of some of the next
day’s newspaper reports.
# # #
A mysterious feature of Canngton’s dinner
in Melbourne was the “laughter ” —vulgar, husky
shouting, or sinister sniggering which sur-
rounded Speaker Davies when he made the
absence of his own wife in Hingland an excuse for
deeply sympathising with Lord Hopetoun’s mis-
fortune in having to endure separation from a
Countess who goes thousands of miles to put her
tongue out. For some unfathomable reason the
whole brilliant assemblage treated the domestic
loneliness of Davies as a joke. Gillies supple-
mented his renowned smile with a faint, flickering
wink, and even solemn old Sir Macßain showed
symptoms of wanting to shake his sides. Jaraes
Service allowed one glance of moral merriment to
steal from under his drooping lids, Carington was
visibly agitated in the region of the lower chin,
and Chief Secretary Deakin grinned into his Van-
dyke beard. And all because a knighted land-
boomer and pillar of the Church expressed a sense
of desolation at the temporary absence of his
missus. It was cruel. Nobody except The
Bulletin knows what Davies suffers in secret —
aye, in secret —now that Lady D. has left him to
his own Christian devices.
# # #
Macßain has publicly announced that when
Lord Carington shakes a man’s hand, he takes
hold of it with a living muscle.” We have never
offered our paw to Carington. Had we done so
and then discovered his muscle to be otherwise
than alive we should have recommended brother
Rupert to make the necessary arrangements.
A Living Muscle.
Whene’er the Baron to your hand
A friendly shake is giving,
There’s not a creature in the land
Whose muscle seems more “ living
His palm and fingers are not stiff,
Or clammy, cold or leaden—
In fact, they don’t appear as if
The Baron were a dead ’un.
They firmly close upon your own
And show you that the shaker
Is more than simple clay and bone,
Fit for the undertaker;
But, Goodness knows, with grief and pain
We should go broken-hearted
If that same hand which grabbed Macßain,
Belonged to one departed.
Our dear old England need not fear
With foreign foe to tussle
While she can flash a noble peer
Who has a living muscle ;
Then tell it from the house-tops high,
Proclaim it from church-steeples—
His lordship’s paw, O, ecstacy !
Is just like other people’s— *
Except to the Macßains and sich.
In a late speech Governor Carington indi
cated that the official language used by Australian
politicians was insufficiently courteous and round-
about for English bureaucratic taste. This, we
presume, is merely the result of there being no
squire to exact the bow of the Australian school-
boy. The independence possessed by a people
may in no small degree bo measured by the out-
spokenness of their language. The manly vigour
which characterises American official and business
correspondence is born of a century of kingless
and lordless democracy—of a recognition of the
principle that “all men are born free and equal.”
That vigour and freedom pervade even the adver-
tisements issued by the Yankee proprietor of
“Rough on Rats,” which, like the speeches you
near read by congress-men, seems to have been
written with the two edges of a bowie-knife,
operated by a man with a sinewy wrist instead of
by the trembling quill of a curate who is asking a
bone from the baron who owns a living. When
Australia shall have learnt to say in two columns
what can be said more explicitly in two lines her
men will have fallen to the level of the average
English globe-trotting dude.
# # #
Said Governor Hopetoun at the Caring-
ton dinner at Melbourne the other evening :
If Lord Carington had not proved the success that he
has done, it is probable that I should not be hero along
with my friend, the Governor of South Australia, to
address you to-night. It was a new departure when the
Home Government sent out my honourable friend. Lord
Carington. I think it was regarded as an experiment.
NEMESIS.
SHE: “YOU’VE HAD YOUR FINGERS IN THE JAM AGAIN.”
“IT”: “NOT ME, I TOOK A SPOON.”
(Laughter.) That experiment, however, has succeeded—
(cheers)—not beyond the expectations of those who knew
Lord Carington ; but that experiment has succeeded so
well that her Majesty’s advisers at home have been able
to continue the new order of things, and to send out non-
professional Governors to preside over the destinies of
these colonies. •
After this, the Baron will be known in history as
“ the Successful Experiment.”
* * *
“Sir” M. H. Davies, at the Caringtoniau
banquet last week, said: “I think all of us will
very readily acknowledge that it is a very great
honour for any man to be able to claim descent
from a long line of ancestors who, during the last
ten generations, have been ennobled by their
sovereigns.” “Ennobled by his sovereigns ” was
an unhappy phrase. Banker Smith, the Caring-
tonian ancestor, was, in reality, ennobled by his
“ sovereigns.”
# * #
“Many a groat feast has the statue of Her
Majesty beamed down upon in the Queen’s Hall,
and this was one of the greatest of them all. Lit
up with a magnificent installation of electric light,
the Hall seemed an architectural dream, beautiful
and soft, while all around the table was a bright,
fresh scene of palm-trees and flowers.” This is
the result of letting the Melbourne Standard
send a special reporter to a Caringtoniau “fare
well.” Fancy the old lady’s statue having to beam
upon such a miserable hogwasher !
* # *
That “Rule Britannia” peroration of
Carington’s speech at Melbourne “representa-
tive ” gorge was probably his most exhausting
effort up to date. The Baron, in fact, ran rings
of oratory round every other tightener of the
silken bonds. He arrived at the festive board
primed with bits of Australian history, and bulg-
ing out with references to colonies in general. He
reeled off quotations from Tod and Sir ’Enry
Parkes, and reminded Chief Justice Way of some-
thing that learned banqueter had said about
Governors and such things on a previous occasion.
He dropped into geography and statistics as
though they were turkey and truffles. He was
careful not to overdose the occasion with Imperial
hints and Our Gracious Queen, but he hinted at
the supreme importance of certain Spanish
marriages in 1846, and so gave the profession of
royalty a casual lift as it were. Once the Baron
said something funny, which few of the company
had heard before, and several times he was quite-
as near being funny as could be expected. Finally
the modesty of his lordship calls for favourable
notice. Whilst the rest of them were waggling
about under the influence of Ins eloquence, he sat
back in his chair and yawned as usual. He put
on no airs in the hour of triumph. Somebody
had fixed up the oration, he had spoken it, and
the morning and the evening had brought time a
day’s march nearer “home.” That was enough
for Carington.
* * *
A member of the Union Club, Sydney,
writing to London Hawk, insinuates that “the
best people ” won’t be sorry when Carington has
gone, for “ he is far too easy-going, and by giving
many mixed dinners, incites the local aristocracy
to send 'refusals’ in reply to his social invitations.”
We must partially endorse this complaint. Gov.
Carington is not over-particular in ids company.
He tolerates, for instance, too many of the noble-
men of the Union Club—the visible part of which
lordly institution is, on analysis, found to consist
of 5 per cent, full-grown white man, and 95 per
cent, of boy-snob.

A gilded youth of Melbourne took a young
lady out for a drive on a recent evening, and their
souls communed together in a cab at 2s. Gd. an
hour. They were both of a romantic turn of
mind, and they talked softly together while the
old ramshackle horse tore round the town. By-
and-bye the lady asked permission to kiss his
hand as an expression of her devotion, and he
handed over his paw in order that she might
worship it, and burn incense before it in a manner
of speaking. When she had quite finished he
suddenly observed that the diamond had disap-
peared out of his ring, and in wild consternation
he shook the cab in the vain hope that the jewel
would fall out. It didn’t fall worth a cent, how-
ever ; and then in his despair he dragged the lady
to the police-office and got her shaken officially,
with precisely the same result. Nothing fell out
of her either. Thereupon he entered a formal
charge of feloniously chewing an article of value
off the person of a law-abiding subject contrary to
the peace of the realm, and a duly authorised
official looked into the prisoner’s back tooth to see
if the missing property was there, and found
nothing. Speaking as an expert he suggested that
possibly the lost article had been crunched up
but there was no evidence to that effect, and the
case fell through. Any citizen who has Ids hands
or feet kissed in a cab from this time forth should
take warning by this incident. No doubt the case
may have been one of unjust suspicion, but still
the top of the head is the safest place for a strange
female to pour out her feelings in the dark, for
then she can embezzle nothing but a hat, and that
is an article that can’t be swallowed without serious
injury to the swallower.

Mr Woolf, barrister, eloquently expa-
tiated in Melbourne Criminal Court the other day
on the disgraceful fact that prisoners who may be
innocent are tried in a hideous iron cage, and that
they await trial in a dreary, chilly stone dungeon
beneath the court. And why is this thus? Because
it is just? No ; because it is English.

A London “Society” paper says that—
Sir Henry Normnn will remain to the end of his guber-
natorial term in Queensland, notwithstanding various
absurd rumours to the contrary. He has succeeded in
living well within his income since - he went to Brisbane
although lie must have felt a trifle nervous over the
experiences of his predecessor, the late Sir Anthony
Musgrave—Lady Musgrave having left Brisbane many
thousands out of pocket, after burying her much
lamented husband. The fact really is that the Bris-
bane Government House is a very easj' one to manage
comparatively speaking. Where in Sydney or Mel-
bourne the Governor has, among other things, to keep
the best of wines on tap the whole of the time, the
Queensland srpiattocraey and legislators, in a general
way, prefer something to drink that they ‘-can feel going-
down.” So it happens that where in Melbourne or
.Sydney agues! will get poundsworths of champagne down
his neck at a sitting, the more modest Queenslander will
waddle home from the vice-regal mansion on about
eighteenpennvwcrth of rum or whisky, satisfied with
himself and all the world beside.
Which, being interpreted, means, if it means any-
thing, that Gov. Norman, finding that eighteen-
penn’orth of snake-juice is all you need dole out to
a Bananaman to make him happy, thinks he can
afford to finish his official term.

It was in a barber’s shop in Pitt-street,
Sydney. The barber was out, and a patient, long-
suffering individual, who had taken off his coat
and hat, was sitting with his head against the
wall waiting till some one would come to cut his
hair. Presently, a breathless dude burst in, and
threw himself into a chair, and issued his ukase
that he should be shaved instantly. The other
customer only heaved a long, melancholy sigh and
sat still, and the dude screamed to him to be
dashed quick and attend to his business, Then
the pensive man gathered up himself and his coat-
tabs and walked over to the chair. He fixed the
apron carefully, and remarked that the weather
seemed to be rather backward, and next he hunted
up the lather and began to soap the stranger in a
gradual pensive way, and the man in the chair
observed that he didn’t care a hang about the
weather, and only wanted him to hurry up, Then
he soaped him again, and remarked regretfully
that it looked like rain, and put on his coat, saying
he felt cold, and finally he capsized all the lather
in the dude’s eye, and made a remark about the
strike and, clutching his hat, faded out at the
door. And, as the enraged dude burst out of the
shop and looked up and down the street with his
only serviceable eye in search of his enemy, he
published a sample of elementary and advanced
blasphemy such as no connoisseur in these parts
had heard before.

Apropos to certain things that have lately
come to the knowledge of The Bulletin, it
would urge upon every actress who intends, in
future, visiting “the colonies” with her “hus-
band,” the necessity of providing herself before-
hand with a marriage-certificate. Mona Caird’s
“free contract” style of matrimony is not yet
officially recognised in Australia. The actress,
also, who comes without her husband should have
a divorce-certificate forwarded per first mail, in
order that she may be enabled to espouse the
other fellow .and, thus whitewashed, enter the best
soweiety.

“A new departure in wedding festivities
was lately inaugurated,” says a London paper,
“when a bridal party of large dimensions took
possession of three private boxes at the Empire
Theatre. There were six little bridesmaids in
blue and yellow, and six small groomsmen in
black and white, besides wedding guests in
reckless abundance, and they excited much
curiosity among the audience.” The example is
one for imitation by that large and shameless
brigade which believes that a wedding can’t be
too public. The prospective bridegroom stands
aghast at the thought of becoming part of a show
on his marriage-day, while nearly every woman
who possesses money or is going to marry money,
frantically howls for a public wedding. While
this difference exists between men and women,
the contention that the fair sex is the more modest
one must be regarded as all flam.

The long days of summer have come round
again, bringing with them the church-bazaar
season. Every suburban maiden is now busily
engaged upon some ghastly piece of work which
she will in the near future carry round some hall
for 15 consecutive nights in quest of unwary
wretches who will be compelled to part a shilling
apiece for a chance of winning it. And when
positively the last chance is taken, the hideous
cushion, or plaster-of-paris saint, or whatever it is,
will be raffled and won by a parson with blue
spectacles who is the uncle of the girl who got up
the raffle, and then will generously giveit back to his
niece, and off she will go again. And when thelist
is once more full there will be another raffle, and
this time it will be won by the girl’s maiden aunt
who lives in Jerilderiejor Thargomindah.and whose
name doesn’t appear upon the list at all, and when
the merry raffle begins to pall, “the soinnmg-
jenny ” will be started going by a gentleman in a
white-choker, who will sweep in the shillings of
the ungodly to provide for the outlay on the new'
back verandah to the vicarage, Presbytery or
manse, as the case may be, and then a dozen small
girls with thin legs will amble round the Maypole
to the accompaniment of two German flutes and a

The church at Ravenswood (Q.) is appa-

the pastor’s patience gave out for good and he
briefly informed the congregation that they were
such a miserably hopeless lot, and so utterly in-
capable of improvement, that he had resolved to
give them up as an incurable job, and quit. He
had admonished them off and on for years, and he
might as well have addressed his remarks to the
old hen that was scratching up the graveyard. If
it'were possible for a congregation to repent by
machinery they might possibly improve some day,
but it was quite evident that they weren’t going
to repent by hand-power. The most promising
member of the flock hadn’t thought about his soul
for two years, and the worst one hadn’t got a
soul apparently, and didn't know how to think.
Anyhow, if he fired a gun promiscuously into the
congregation, the chances of hitting a parishioner
who was prepared for death wouldn’t pay for the
wear and tear of the weapon. They wo'Jd now

John Price’s father was not the original
of Maurice Frfere in “ His Natural Life,"
according to those who ought to know. Old
“lags” give the place of honour to a Captain
O’Hara Booth, an officer and a gentleman whose
records harmonise more with the story of Frere
than do those of the murdered tyrant. Price,
however, was brutal enough to have been three
Maurice Freres rolled into one, and his destruc-
tion, at the hands of the wretches over whom he
rode roughshod, was only a question of time.
“They’ll kill you if they get a chance,” was the
remark often made to Price by a subordinate,
who, in due course, saw the gory fulfilment of
his prophecy. He was standing near Price, when
a little batch of convicts rushed up and bashed
the boss to death with stones, whilst his com-
panion was told to keep still and he wouldn’t be
touched. That murder was regarded as an act of
sacred duty to be performed at the first oppor-
tunity. And when some of the men saw an
opportunity they proceeded to “ aim low but
effectively,” and John Price was laid out for good.

“ Colonel ” Barker, who started the Harmy

Salvationist in ten thousand —a veritable Napoleon

hope he will rescue lots of lady passengers from
the naughty, naughty ship’s officers when they get
into the tropics. Which reminds us that the
Harmy might do worse than plant a hallelujah
stewardess on every mail-steamer, all over ,tpe
world, for a restraining influence in a poke-bonnet
is urgently required in all such spheres. Last
week, according to the cable, a young Australian,
lady committed suicide under the delusion that
she had been somebody’s “ victim ” during her
voyage home, but quite a number of girls arrive at
the same conclusion without suffering from any

The express was just starting from Red-
fern railway-station when the last woman, who
always turns up just when it is too late, fled
hysterically along the platform. She had a band-
box and six parcels, and three children, and her
hair was coming down. One of the children was
crying vociferously, and one of them was clutch-
ing a doll, and the third was dishevelled and
sticky owing to a half-eaten bun, and the whole
caravan was waving its umbrella excitedly. The
woman wi’enched open the.door of a first-class
compartment and threw in the infant with the
bun, and then that carriage escaped her and the
offspring and the nourishment rolled gently away.
She tried the door of the next carriage, but it was
fast, so she heaved the band-box in at the window.
She hung on to a third door and burst it open, and
shoved in the vociferous child with the swollen
head, and then she fell off and scampered along
the platform with the rest of the family and the
other six parcels, and could find a footing no-
where. . She split her frock right across the knees
trying vainly to climb into the guard’s van, but
lost her hold and the train glided away, leaving
her behind, red and squashed and delirious. Then
she gathered up the ruins of herself, and went off
to telegraph to the next station for the recovery
and return of an infant with a half-eaten bun, and
a flushed child supposed to be screaming in a
third-compartment, and a band-box. Whether
she recovered them or not nobody knows.

Russia: An Ode.
BY ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE.
[The following bitter attack on the C zar was the cause
of a House of Commons’ debate. One member thought
Swinburne should be restrained from utterances which
might lead to foreign complications, but the Under-
secretary for Foreign Affairs replied that Russia and
Britain combined had not power to silence the poet.
Swinburne is of aristocratic birth and has powerful
friends, so that Government dared not treat him as it
treated the poor Socialist, Johann Most, whom it sent to
gaol for advocating in an obscure paper the killing of the
German Emperor William.]
Out of hell a word comes hissing, dark as doom,
Fierce as fire, and foul as plague-polluted gloom ;
Out of hell wherein the sinless damned endure
More than ever sin conceived of pains impure ;
More than ever ground men’s living souls to dust;
Worse than madness ever dreamed of murderous
lust.
Since the world’s wail first went up from lands and
seas
Ears have heard not, tongues have told not things
like these.
Dante, led by'love’s an.d [hate’s accordant spell
Down the deepest and the loathliest ways of hell,
Where beyond the brook of blood the rain was fire,
Where the scalps were masked with dung more
deep than mire,
Saw not, where the tilth was foulest, and the night
Darkest, depths whose fiends could match the
Muscovite.
Set beside this truth, his deadliest vision seems
Pale and pure and painless as a virgin’s dreams.
Maidens dead beneath the clasping lash, and
wives
Rent with deadlier pangs than death —for shame
‘ survives,
Naked, mad, starved, scourged, spurned, frozen,
fallen, deflowered,
Souls and bodies as by fangs of beast devoured,
Sounds that hell would hear not, sights no thoughts
could shape,
Limbs that feel as flame the ravenous grasp of
rane.
Filth of raging crime and shame that crime enjoys,
Age made one with youth in torture, girls with
boys, t ,
These, and worse, if aught be worse than these 1
things are,
Prove thee regent, Russia—praise thy mercy,
Czar.
Sons of man, men born of women, may we dare
Say they sin, who dare be slain, and dare not
spare ?
They who take their lives in hand and smile on
death,
Holding life as less than sleep’s most fitful breath,
So their life perchance or death may serve and
speed
Faith and hope, that die if dream become not
deed?
Naught is death and naught is life and naught .is
fate
Save for souls that love has clothed with fire of
hate.
These behold them, weigh them, prove them, find
them naught,
Save by light of hope and fire of burning,thought.
M hat though sun be less than storm where these
aspire,
Dawn than lightning, song than thunder, light
than fire ?
IT el p is none in heaven ; hope sees no gentler star:
Earth is hell, and hell bows down before the Czar.
All its monstrous, murderous, lecherous births
acclaim
Him whose empire lives to match its fiery flame.
Nay, perchance at sight or sense of deeds here
done,
Here where men may lift up eyes to greet the sun,
Hell recoils heart-stricken ; horror worse than hell
Darkens earth, and sickens heaven ; life knows the
spell,
Shudders, quails, and sinks-or, filled with fierier
breath,
Rises red in arms devised of darkling death.
Pity mad with passion, anguish mad with shame
Call aloud on justice by her darker name;
Love grows hate for love’s , sake ; life takes death
for guide.
Night hath none but one red star—Tyrannicide.
God or man, be swift; hope sickens with delay :
Smite, and send him howling down his father’s
way!
Pall, O fire of heaven, and smite as fire from hel
Halls wherein men’s torturers, crowned and cower-
ing, dwell!
These that crouch and shrink and shudder, girt
with power—
These that reign, and dare not trust one trembling
hour—
These omnipotent, whom terror curbs and drives —
These whose life reflects in fear their victims’
lives—
These whose breath sheds poison, worse than
plague’s thick breath—
These whose reign is ruin, these whose word is
death,
These w hose will turns heaven to hell, and day to
night,
These, if God’s hand smite not, how shall man’s
not smite?
So from hearts by horror withered as by fire
Surge the strains of unappeasable desire;
Sounds that bid the darkness lighten, lit for
death;
Bid the lips whose breath was doom yield up their
breath ;
Down the way of Czars, awhile in vain deferred,
Bid the Second Alexander light the Third.
How for shame shall men rebuke them ? how
may we
Blame, whose fathers died, and slew, to leave us
free ?
We, though all the world cry 'out upon them,
know,
Were our strife as theirs, we could not but strike
so;
Could not cower, and could not kiss the hands
that smite;
Could not meet them armed in sunlit battle’s
light.
Dark as fear and red as hate though morning rise,
Life it is that conquers : death it is that dies.

dates back to the laying of the first egg, and has
been hatched in every language about every stupid
person who went on his travels. Therefore, it is
somewhat stale, and has no virtue except when a
greater goose than ordinary can be found for re-
setting.

the raven hair, the braids and braceletsswan-like
bosoms, and the necklace, an India in itself, yet dazzling
not the eye like what it circled, the thin robes floating
like clouds ’twixt our gaze and heaven ; the many
twinkling feet so small and sylphlike, suggesting the
more secret symmetry of the fair forms which terminate
so well, still linger in our reporter’s mind, and no doubt
linger in the minds of the other spectators.

strictures on Count Tolstoi:—
Ih controversy most men—and, I think, all women—will

to engage in it. They do not know what is a premise nor
• what is a conclusion. They do not know any better than
to make personal applications of general statements.
They do not refrain from ascription of motive. With a
feeble consciousness of not understanding what has been
said, they make elaborate replies to what has not been
said. As to truth, they frankly, and, I am persuaded,
quite honestly, ignore it. Perhaps they so profoundly
respect it that they will not touch it. Or else they
regard it as too precious to be wasted upon the unworthy.

THIS Company lias been formed to acquire the Letters Patent for New South
Wales of a perfected Postal, Telephonic, and Electric Alarm Pillar, and to
carry into effect an agreement for the Erection of such Pillars in the City and
Suburbs of Sydney,
_ The Invention may be concisely described rts an Ornamental Octagonal Box,
designed to supersede the existing pillars and having the following original
features
1. An ingenioUsly-constrttcted mechanism insuring the letter receptacles
being cleared with greater efficiency and despatch that! is possible under
the present system.
2> A readily-seen dial indicating the times of clearances and, by automatically
registering each collection, affording the means of detection and consequent
prevention of irregular and nnpUnctual service.
8. An electric fire-alarm, placing Within easy reach of every inhabitant direct
communication with the Metropolitan Brigade Stations, and from its
accessibility and immediate action materially lessening the risk of loss and
danger.
4. An electric police-alarm, increasing the efficiency and power of the police
by enabling constables to summon assistance wheiietef and wherever it is
required.
6. Each pillar Will be illuminated at night, and thus add tO the safety of our
streets and crossings ; the light will also serve an important purpose in
indicating the positions of the fire and police alarms.
m
u
Mebhbtaical Ingenuity Us been directed to utilisihg to the htmbst the facilities
ottered by the indispensable letter-box for every public service in which it may be
profitably employed;
The Police, lire, ami Municipal Authorities have fully recognised the advan-
tages of the invention, and have concurred with the Postmaster-General’s decision
to supersede the existing pillars by those of the improved form.
■ a ,consideration for providing ahd maintaining the patented pillars, the
light has been conceded of advertising oh the surface of the boxes and upon the
glass tops for a period of 17 years from March, 1880.
Their use necessitating the placing of letter receptacles in the most prominent
Positions and in the busiest centres, they offer unrivalled advantages as an adver-
tising medium. They Cfinnot but bo constantly before the eyes of the public and
advertisements so conspicuously placed Caniibt fail to arrest attention.
The ereetioh of the pillars will introduce the most novel and unique form of
advertising known in Australia and meet a want hitherto impossible to satisfy.
Ihe glass tops have been designed for the display of advertisements by night, and
trial will prove this a means without parallel for securing wide and universal
publicity.
°ne hundred pillars are now in Course of construction, and the Company is
prepared to submit terms and receive orders at the offices, 108 Pitt-sfcreet, opposite
the General Post-office, Sydney.
fjHE Company, whose' prospectus we publish herewith, are to be congratulated on
being the first (not only in the colonies, but, we understand, in Europe, Asia or
America) to 1 introduce this ingenious and artistic in! vent ion, combining at once a
Postal Pillar Box, Telephone Exchange,
3Poli.ce and Fire Alarm..
In this matter, at all events, Sydney is aheckl of the world. The Pillar is “ octagonal ’*
in shape, and is so constructed that the time of each clearance is automatically regis-
tered by an easily-seen “"Dial” above the Letter Slot, and which, at the same time,
indicates at what hour the next clearance takes place. The Panels are divided into
FOUR TIERS, and the spaces on each are intended for
ADVERTISING PURPOSES,
The following are the dimensions Base, 21 x 10| in.; Body, 31)? x 9 in.; Upper Tier,
14 x 1.0)? in.Olass Top, 24x10 in. All Advertisements will be PAINTED in OIL
COLOURS' in a neat and artistic manner, and the fact that all are subject to the
APPROVAL OF THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL AND THE MAYOR,
will be sufficient guarantee to the public that nothing objectionable will be allowed to
appear. The suggestion by some of the metropolitan Press that these Pillars would
be used; advantage ground for “bill-stickers” is absolutely erroneous, and one that
was never dreamt of by the promoters for an instant. As of necessity these Pillars
must be- placed in the busiest and most accessible positions, their efficacy as advertising
mediums must be at once apparent. The GLASS TOPS will be ILLUMINATED
AT NIGHT for the DISPLAY OF ADVERTISEMENTS—a fact that must increase
the safety of our streets and crossings, and give a ready indication of the position
of the Police and : Fire Alarms.
);(
The ELECTRIC FIRE ALARM
Places every citizen in direct communication with, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade
and from its accessibility and- quick action, materially lessens the risk of loss' And
danger by fire. We, understand Mr. Superintendent Bear highly approves of this
scheme, and is ; anxious tb' have it extended throughout the principal suburbs as soon
as possible; The “ELECTRIC ALARM ” will be hailed with joy by the police, as,
if in need of assistance, the lonely hobby will only have to struggle on to the nearest
pillar-box and! sound the alarm.
The TELEPHONE
Must also prove a great boon, and should be in large demand bv BUSINESS and
PROFESSIONAL MEN in the CITY and SUBURBS, as for a mere nominal sum
each subscriber is entitled to a key. Business people could in this way collect their
suburban orders, instead of the present tedious and expensive method of sending their
Vans round; . A large number of subscriptions may be expected from the ladies, who
can do a large amount of their shopping in this way. They Will also be able to
ascertain in a moment if “hubby” is really working late at the office, has gone to
the club, 01 ill be home to dinner. This should have a good moral effect, and is
sure to bring in a number of subscribers. The Telephone wires connected to the
Pillars are carried underground by “special insulation,” the
Invention of the Managing Director, Mr, J. COLQUHOUN-THOMSON,
we understand. Some of the largest firms in the city have inspected the model of
the Pillar, and have expressed their approval of the medium as a means of obtaining
general publicity throughout the city and suburbs.
, ):(
We have beeil shown a PULRSIZED MODEL (somewhere about Bft. high),
the groundwork from base to upper tier being painted in VERMILLION and best
CARRIAGE VARNISH, while the glass-work on the top presented Art Designs of
a very order. The general appearance, so far from being ah “ unsightly
monstrosity, as asserted in a daily paper, must be considered highly ornamental,
whilst its many ingenious and economical properties must command the admiration
of all, and entitle it to be considered as a decided acquisition to this city and a
monument to the genius of the ifrVentor.
We understand the RATES for ADVERTISING SPADES are MODERATE,
and as people are nowadays always on the look-out for “Novelties,” this medium
should attract a good deal of attention, particularly the displaying of advertisements
in the glass-top at night.
All advertisements Will be kept and maintained in first-class order.
W ith a large capital to work on, it is, we believe, the intention of this Company
to extend their operations to the adjoining colonies. They have also several other
“ unique ” inventions ih embryo, which they intend to spring on the world later oh.
Any further information can be obtained at the Company’s Office, 108 Pitt-street, SYDNEY.

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived diiectly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World,
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim theft every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, it?
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege —the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvat ion, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in w'hich they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pcarl-shellcr of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official—that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

The palace of Midas, the mighty, is founded on

There lie storied the struggles of Labour in a hun-

And its walls throw a growing shadow on the

Where the battle of life is bitter and man seems
his own worst foe.
The cattle of Midas stable ’neath a roof that is
broad and high,
Though the children of Giles lie huddled in a foul
and cheerless stye,
Where the clock of a drear existence is wound up
in one poor room,
And no ray of sunshine pierces the sullen and
settled gloom;
Where every new-comer inherits a future already
damned,
For the ranks of crime are recruited from its file
of hunger-clammed,
And its budding maidens ever are caught in the
panderer’s mesh,
1 When the needs of the poor pay taxes to a Ctesar’s
I lust of flesh.
; See, the sweater’s car flies swiftly, every spoke a
producer’s limb,
And his sparkling gems are mirror’d in the tears
that make serfs’ eyes dim ;
: And the gainers’ robes are empurpled from the

And the flocks of a David are swol’n by the

And the monarch’s cake is moulded from a powder

And the song of his laureate floats on a chorus of

i For the products that toil hath garnered are
trapped by the idler’s net.
Spread everywhere, acres lie waiting the impulse
of fettered hands.
For each footfall of hind and farmer is taxed by

And the whirr of invention lessens the number of

While the plea of each barred-out worker reduces

Wolfe’s Schnapps cheers the mind and body.
A touching story comes to us from Scot-
land of one M'Tavish, whose study of Darwin
convinced him that, with care, any living
organism might be gradually educated to adapt
itself to new environments. He commenced by
experimenting on a herring, which he kept in a
tub of sea-water. He renewed the water daily
for some time, and gradually reduced the quantity
with so little inconvenience to the herring that he
concluded that the fish might in time learn to
breathe air undiluted with water, like the cat and
the man. It turned out as he expected, and the
water was finally turned out of the tub, never to
be replaced. M‘Tavish next removed the fish from
its tub and placed it on the ground, where it
flopped about awkwardly at first, but soon learned
to move freely and rapidly. In a little while the
herring was able to follow its master without
difficulty, and then it became his constant com-
panion about the streets of the city. On a certain
unfortunate day MTavish had occasion to cross a
dilapidated bridge which spanned an arm of the
harbour. The herring corning gracefully along,
heedless of danger, now and again springing at
the ephemera, for which it had acquired an
especial fondness, missed its footing, slipped
through a crack into the water beneath, and was
drowned. Mac. at first was disconsolate, but is
consoling himself by training a flounder to spend
his evenings on roller-skates.

‘The Conventional Lies
of our Civilisation.”
THE ECONOMIC LIE (CONTINUED).—CHAPTER III.
BY MAX MORDAU.
THE first question which arises in our minds as we
look upon this picture of the financial and social
conditions of life, is; must they necessarily re-
main as they are ? Are we confronting the opera-
tions of the unchangeable laws of nature, or the
consequences of man s folly and imbecility ? Why
does a small minority revel in the enjoyment of
every good, in whose production it takes no part ?
Why is a certain class of human beings, consist-
ing of millions, precondemned to hunger and
wretchedness ? This is the most important point
of the problem that is to be solved. The question
is: do the poor starve because the earth does not
produce food in sufficient quantities lor them to
have their share, or because they cannot obtain
possession of what is produced in plenty? We
can exclude the latter alternative from our dis-
cussion. If provisions were produced in ample
abundance with a sufficiency for all, then] the
share which would fall to the poor man and which
he cannot afford to buy, would be left over. Ex-
perience proves that nothing of the kind takes
place. As each year comes around, the entire
harvest of breadstuffs and other food products, is
used up by the time the new harvest is gathered
in. The annual supply of provisions is exhausted
when the new supply pours into the markets,
and yet notrevery individual of the whole human
race has been able to eat his till every day in the
year; no breadstuffs are thrown away from over-
supply and meat never rots for lack of purchasers.
To be sure the rich waste more goods than they
actually require to satisfy the regular require-
ments of the body, but amongst these goods the
most material, provisions, are in the smallest pro-
portion to the rest. The millionaire squanders the
results of man’s labour to gratify his whims, his
love of luxury or his vanity. He throws aside
clothing which is far from being no longer service-
able. He builds houses of unnecessary size and
fills them with superfluous furniture. He takes
men away from useful production and maintains
them in criminal idleness as lackeys and com-
panions, or in serai-occupation as coachmen, body-
servants, &o. But in regard to provisions, he
consumes at the utmost hardly more than four
times what he actually requires to satisfy his
organic wants, even making allowance for the most
wasteful housekeeping. Let us assume that there
are a million of such extravagant beings in the
civilised world; with their families we can
estimate the number at five millions. These five
millions would consume _ provisions sufficient for
twenty millions, so that in addition to their own
natural share they use up that of fifteen million
other human beings. This would only explain the
fact that fifteen millions are entirely deprived of
their share of food, or that thirty millions merely
receive one-half of what they are naturally
entitled to. But the number of those human
beings in Europe alone, who suffer from hunger
and want, can be estimated with certainty at twice
that number—that is, sixty millions. Conse-
quently we must accept the other alternative and
decide that the earth does not produce sufficient
food for all, and hence that a part of the human
race is condemned without mercy to absolute,
physiological want.
# * *
Is this the result of natural causes? Does the
earth produce no more because it is incapable of
producing more? No. It does not give food,
because food is not asked of it. When the science
of economy, created and upheld by Capital, was
confronted by the problem of the disproportion
between the hungry multitudes and the amount of
food-products destined to satisfy their hunger, it
did not torment its thinking faculties very long,
but soon came across an honest fellow named
Malthus who proclaimed without prejudice or
partiality: “The time has come when the earth
is no longer able to support her children.
Therefore we must diminish their number.”
And he preached prudence in marrying
and temperance after marriage but only
for the poor. A trifle more and he would
have advocated the castration of every in-
dividual born without a regular income, and the
re-organisation of humanity upon the pattern of
the societies of ants and bees which have but a
few individuals possessing the power of propagat-
ing their species, while the majority is composed
of sexless individuals who have only the right to
labour for those more completely developed. Such
a condition of affairs could not fail to complete
the happiness of the millionaires. It never
entered the heads of the pious Malthus and his
disciples, to state their principle in a reversed
form : “ The provisions produced by the earth are
not sufficient to support her children. Therefore
we must increase the amount of provisions,” and
yet it seems as if this would be the most natural
remedy for the economic distress. There surely
cannot be any man in existence, in possession of
his reasoning faculties, who would dare to assert
that it is impossible to increase the amount of
agricultural products. If there does exist such a
fool, he can easily be silenced by a few figures.
Europe supports 316 millions of inhabitants upon
an area of 9,710,340 square kilometers; that is,
it supports them aided by the contributions of
provisions it receives from India, southern Africa,
Algeria, North A me ri ca and Australia. Enor-
mous quantities of grain and meat are imported
from these countries into Europe, which sends
them nothing in return, except, perhaps, wines.
And yet with all this stream of food flowing into
the country a considerable portion of the popula-
tion suffers from actual want. Europe as a
whole, thus confesses its incapability of support-
ing 32 human beings on one square kilometer.
But Belgium supports 5,536,000 inhabitants on an
area of 29,455 kilometers, consequently in this
country one kilometer is amply sufficient to
support 200 human beings, a number six times
as large as that which we have found to be the
average for Europe as a whole. If the soil
throughout the whole of Europe were cultivated
like that of Belgium, it could support a population
of 1950 millions much more completely and abund-
antly than the 316 millions it now supports so
poorly. Or if the number of the population
remained the same, each man would have six times
as much food as he could consume. But we are
reminded that Belgium iinports provisions also,
showing that its agricultural products are not
sufficient to feed the nation. Very well, let us
assume that Belgium buys one-quarter of the
provisions it requires in foreign lands. Even pro-
ceeding upon this assumption we find that it
supports 150 inhabitants on each square kilometer,
which figure, applied to Europe, gives us a popu-
lation of 1458 millions which it could support-
more than all mankind now numbers. Let us
take another examples China, without its depen-
dencies, has an area' of 4,024,890 square kilome-
ters, upon which are dwelling 405 millions of
human beings. The square kilometer supports
100 people, and supports them completely, for
China, far from importing provisions, exports
large quantities of rice, preserves, tea, &c.
According to the unanimous testimony of all
travellers in China, hunger and want are only ex-
perienced there in years when the crops fail to
come to maturity. And this famine is only the
result of the undeveloped means of transportation,
not of a deficit in the agricultural products of the
whole Empire. Thus we see that if the soil of
Europe _ were tilled and managed like that of
China, it could support 1000 millions of human
beings, instead of its 316 millions who are so
poorly fed that they are emigrating annually by
hundreds of thousands to other parts of the world.
* * #
Why is not more exacted of the soil when
experience shows that it responds so readily to all
demands made upon it ? Why does not mankind
make the effort to raise agricultural products
sufficient for every human being to have enough
and to spare? Why? Owing to one single reason :
the accumulation of capital has led to a one-sided
and unnatural development of our civilisation.
Civilisation is crowding towards manufactures
and trade all the time, turning its back upon the
production of food. Physiocracy, which teaches
us that the true wealth of a country lies solely in
its agricultural products, has been held up to
ridicule during the last hundred years by the
official science of political economy, which has
condescended so far as to be the court jester of
the present arrangement of the economic world,
founded upon egotism and Capital.
* * *
The son of the soil forsakes his plough, the
freedom of the country and nature and the pure,
abundant sunshine and air, to force his way into
that fatal prison, the factory, and take up his
abode in Some pestilential tenement house in the
big city, in obedience to a kind of suicidal
instinct. The same instinct seems to impel the
human race as a whole, to abandon the food-
producing soil and cast themselves into the slough
of manufacturing industry where they suffocate
and starve. _ The whole genius of mankind, all its
powers of invention, contrivance and investiga-
tion, all its enquiry and experiments, are applied
exclusively to its manufactures. We see the
results: the machines grow more and more
wonderful, the systems of labour more and more
perfect, the production of goods more and more
prolific. But hardly one inventive genius in a
hundred busies himself with the production of
food. If only one half as much study and
ingenuity were applied to this production as to
the industrial arts, physiological want would not
only cease to exist on earth, but would become
absolutely inconceivable. But this branch of
human industry, the most important of all, is the
very one that is neglected to such a degree that
we wring our hands in despair. In the domain of
manufactures we are highly civilised beings, but
in regard to the culture of the soil, we are still in a
barbarism as dark as midnight. We congratulate
ourselves upon our marvellous ingenuity in employ-
ing and rendering valuable by means of our
manufactures the refuse and waste formerly con-
sidered absolutely worthless. But at the same
time, we are allowing the contents of the city
sewers to escape us, without being utilised, and be
emptied into the rivers to pollute them. The sea,
their final destination, does not return in its
fishes and pearls a thousandth part of the value of
what we pour into it. This waste of millions of
tons of the most valuable waste-products is
positively atrocious, and yet it is comical when
we see the anxiety and care with which the tiniest
drop of sulphuric acid is saved and utilised in the
chemical laboratories, and the tearing haste with
which an inventor secures a patent when he has
succeeded in perfecting a process by which the
refuse from some manufacture can be turned to a
profitable account. We boast of having harnessed
the powers of nature, and yet we allow millions of
acres of land to remain barren, although we know
theoretically that there is not a single district that
must of necessity remain a desert. We know
that every kind of soil, even if it consists of iron
shoe-nails or crushed stones, can be made produc-
tive by heat and water, whose application is not
j beyond human power except, perhaps, at the
poles. We point with pride to our coal and copper
mines which are tunneled deep into the earth and
under the ocean, and yet we are not ashamed of
the bare mountain sides above them, from which
man, the same being who has burrowed into their
depths, is unable to produce anything. We can
control the lightning from the' skies, and yet are
not able to procure more than an atom of the
inexhaustible treasures of food that are concealed
in the oceans which deprive us of three-fourths of
the entire globe. How can we explain the fact
that in a period which gives birth to such
mechanical marvels as our labour-saving ap-
pliances and the more delicate tools and instru-
ments capable of such astonishingly minute and
accurate work, we allow swamps, rivers without
fish, uncultivated tracts and waste land, to exist
in the midst of Europe ? How can it be that the
generation after Gauss is so weak in its mathe-
matical faculties, that it does not reckon upon its
fingers how much more expensive it is to supply
the albuminous food needed by the body, by meat
from cattle, which require so much productive
land to be left waste for their pasturage, instead
of by fish, with which the sea is teeming, while it
can be used in no other way, or by poultry, which
do not require large meadows to roam over, and
can be abundantly fed from the refuse of the
kitchen ?
# * *
However, I will not proceed any further into
details. The fact seems to me sufficiently demon-
strated that the cultivation of the soil is the step-
child of our civilisation. It hardly takes one
forward stride where manufactures take a hun-
dred. The only progress realised in the production
of food for mankind during several centuries is the
introduction of the potato into Europe, which
makes it possible for the operative, the proletaire,
to imagine that his hunger is satisfied, when at
the same time his body is slowly starving to death
for want of proper nutriment, while it enables the
capitalist to screw down the wages of his em-
ployes to the lowest possible point. Fruit and
vegetable gardens, mushroom beds, show us what
a wealth of provisions can be produced on the
tiniest scrap of ground. Experience teaches us
that man’s labour, as a general thing, can nowhere
be employed more lucratively than in agriculture.
If a man should work over his field with the
shovel and spade instead of the summary plough,
he would find that a plot of ground of incredibly
small size would be sufficient to support him.
But mankind is suffering for want of food, pro-
visions are growing more and more expensive, and
the wages-receiver must work an increased number
of hours each day to get enough to eat. Nature
shows man that he cannot live apart from her,
without the soil, that he requires the field as the
fish requires water. Man recognises that he sinks
lower and lower when he forsakes the soil, that
the farmer is the only one who remains healthy
and strong, while the city saps the very marrow
in the bones of its inhabitants, rendering them
liable to disease and unfruitful, so that each
family absolutely rots out in two or three genara-
tions. The city would become in a hundred
years an enormous cemetery, without a single
living being within its walls, if it were not for the
fact that there is a constant influx of people from
the country to fill up the ranks left vacant by
death. In spite of their knowledge and appre-
ciation of these facts men continue to abandon the
fruitful fields and flock to the cities, to tear them-
selves away from life and throw themselves into
the arms of death.
* # #
Now the professor of political economy steps up
again and says with an air of bland confidence and
intrepidity that the measure of development to
which the manufacturing industries of a country
have attained, is at the same time, the measure of
its civilisation, and that an advanced stage of
manufactures is a blessing to the nation as it
makes the goods produced so cheap as to be
within the reach of the poorest. This is one of
the most widely spread and most frequently
repeated lies with which Capital seeks to deceive
I
( mankind. A plague upon such cheapness ! It is
a benefit to no one, except perhaps to the manu-
facturer and merchant. We have seen how this
cheapness of the manufactured articles is brought
about: by the competitions between capitals,
carried on at the expense of the operatives, and by
the conscience-less, criminal exhaustion of the
powers of human labour. The factory employe
must be chained to his machine ten, twelve, per-
haps fourteen hours a day, so that cotton cloth
may be sold at this cheap rate. He finds no
opportunity to enjoy even the mere privilege of
living. He spends his life inside the dreary
factory walls, making continually a succession of
identical, automatic movements, as the machine
requires it. He is the sole living being in the
universe who spends the greater part of his life-
time in work contrary to nature, merely to keep
himself alive. Of course the goods decline in
price as the result of such labour. At the same
time they deteriorate in quality. The entire
development of our manufactures tends constantly
towards the substitution of lower grade raw
material for higher grade, and to the employment
of the smallest possible amount of it in the finished
article. Why ? Because the raw material, if of
an organic nature, is derived from the animal or
vegetable kingdoms, and can only be procured for
its actual value in labour, hence it is • expensive.
The earth does not allow herself to be cheated;
she gives cotton and flax, wood and wool, but only
in proportion as she receives the equivalent in
labour and nourishment. The cow and the sheep
cannot be screwed down to nothing; they will
only produce their hides and wool, horns and
hoofs, if they are not properly supplied with food.
Man alone is more stupid than the earth, more
easily imposed on than the cow and the sheep.
He gives up his nerve and muscular strength
without demanding its full value in exchange.
Hence the manufacturer has every reason to be
saving of the expensive raw material, and lavish
of the cheap human labour. He adulterates and
diminishes the quantity of the former, but gives
the finished products a handsome appearance by
laborious or complicated processes of labour, that
is to say, by an unstinted use of human labour.
In the finished piece of calico offered by the
English manufacturer in the market there is the
smallest possible amount of cotton fibre and the
largest possible amount of human labour. The
calico is cheap because the manufacturer is not
obliged to pay his human slaves for their toil as
much as the earth requires for her cotton fibre.
But it is far from necessary that these goods should
be so cheap. Their low price leads to an extrava-
gant use of them. Even the poor people in our
present civilisation, renew their clothing and
household goods oftener than is strictly necessary,
and throw aside articles that could still yield
good service, that in reality do continue to yield
service, as is shown by the great trade in second-
hand clothing, etc., between Europe and the
colonies. At the close of the year the European
has spent the same amount for clothing as he
would have _ spent if the goods had been far
higher in price, for in the latter case, he would
certainly have worn them longer. Thus we see
the practical result of this vaunted lowness of
: prices, the pride of the economic world. It does
not bring any actual relief or saving to the con-
sumer, because the tyrannical custom of lavish
use of the goods keeps pace with it. It is a curse
to the labour that produces the goods because it
diminishes the amount of its earnings more and
more, while compelling it to constantly increasing
exertions. Every individual that does not belong
to the minority of wealthy idlers, is a producer of
some one article and a consumer of others. Hence
the result of the whole vaunted development of
the manufacturing industries in our civilisation,
is nothing more than a mad chase growing wilder
and fiercer every day, in which each participant
is at the same time hunter and hunted, driving
the soul out of the body, and ending in a sudden
collapse with lolling tongue and breath entirely
spent.

The Referee.
With Caulfield Gklifteas Day (Oct. lltll) the
annual racing boom makes a fair start, and the mysterious,
fat-necked man, who has got a “ sure thing for the Cup
concealed about his person-, becomes an object of all-
absorbing interest. The fat-necked man seems to be
scarcer than usual this year, and the most industrious
horse-talker finds it hard to pick up ten straight-tips in
the Course of one working day. “ White’s lot,” alas . are
scattered here and there, to the utter confusion of that
large regiment of punters who for years were content to
back the best of White’s and chance what the other
people knew, even before the weights came out. The
break-up of that successful stable has undoubtedly put
the old followers off their first shots, the Strike has kept
racing quite in the background since Randwick meeting,
and the betting-market, at time of writing, is languidly
waiting for Something to turn up. According to the
newspapers, there are fools who accept 10 to 1 about
either of the two top weights, yet nobody swallows those
alleged transactions .very greedily. But the fact that
Carbine and Melos are nominally favourites serves to
show that no strong fancies, private or public, have made
their appearance on the books. Until something more is
known about the “class” of this season’s three-year-
olds, and the form, improved or otherwise, of the
older horses weighted between, say, 7st. 71b. and
Bst. 91b., it is impossible to think of Carbmt
or Melos as a certainty. A Dunlop or Mentor
at Bst. 31b., or even a Bravo at Bst. 71b. would beat
them. Not until the middle weights are found tc
include no real good horses, w hereby we mean none likely
to be fivers on Cup day, can punters afford to take short
odds about the top weights. There might be a dangerous
old one handicapped at less than “seven-seven,” but no
likely name catches the eye. Only a good horse can win
the Cup, as it is run now-a-days, and a few pounds more
or less off the back of an indifferent one gives it no more
chance of licking champions over two miles than the
receiving of an extra ten points in a hundred gives to the
duffer who meets Jack Roberts at billiards. A brilliant,
very brilliant, youngster can win, even at 7st. 61b., but
there is little encouragement to hack any of the A. J.O.
Derby horses for this race, their close running being fait
evidence against the probability of either coming out as
a Martini-Henry. The real merits of Gibraltar, however,
have yet to be proved. hooking then for a winner
amongst the seasoned horses that have earned a decent
Weight, wfe have not only to choose between Carbine and
Melos, but also to consider how few of the others are
likely to beat them. Better leave the winning question
open for closer analysis in another week or turn, merely
suggesting in the meantime that Merrie England, Sir
William, Sultan, Cardigan, Oakleigh, The Lawyer, Merri-
ment, G’Naroo, Pakeha, Wycombe, Newmaster, Whaka-
wai, Carrington and Titan are, for various reasons,
unlikely to silence either of the great guns.
* * *
The Caulfield Guineas is a “ moral ” for Titan,
In the opinion of Ids owner. Certainly the opinion of the
Sanguine young man, who pays such monstrous sums for
geldings, is not worth very much, hut better authorities
tip Titan to win this mile-race, which gelding Rudolph
ran away with last year.
* # *
Tradition scratched for two Cups. The Bul*
i.etix warned punters not to touch the big disappoint-
ment, some weeks ago, yet he was quite recently reported
to be doing “ splendid work.”
* * *
It is said that Titan has been backed to beat
Gibraltar for a place in the V.R.O. Derby for an even
i>soo °- , * *
There is a difference between the styles in which
racing is Conducted at Randwick and Flemington which
strangely recalls a dispute which once took place in the
amateur athletic world. In London and district races are
run with the right hand inside, in the North and Mid-
lands the style is contrary. Whatever may be the case
with bipeds, the direction should make little difference
with racehorses.
* * *
The betting in London on the Slavin-Jackson
fight is in favour of Slavin. It will he remembered that
Tub Bn.i.KTis was the only paper all along to fancy
Slavic’s chances in such an encounter,
* * #
The present so-called boxing contests are merely
savage prize-fights, and if Slavin and Jackson meet for a
convincing test, and not anerely to scoop gate-money, it
Would he much less hypocritical for them to have it out
in the “good old style‘ —on a raw-meat and grass basis
under London prize-ring rules. We presume that the
Slavin party would he a good deal more eager for this
than Jackson and Co.
# # #
A solicitor asserted, in one of the Melbourne
courts, that the public were “ far more interested in the
Slavin-M'Auhffo fight than in the great strike.” Bosh !
Slavin and his chopping-block didn’t raise the price of gas
and firing, rtor have they ever received instructions toaim
low. Even Peter Jackson has faded out of notice for the
time being,
# . * #
Oracularly says Peter Jackson, who has not
hidden his flOwer-like sweetness under a bushellt’s
all bunkum to talk of born fighters. Many a man who
was horn a fighter died without knowing anything about
it.” Quite right, Peter. But next time throw the senti-
ment off your chest thus
Pull many a gem of purest ray serene
The dark unfathom’d caves of ocean bear ;
Full many a flower was born to blush unseen
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
* # *
The modern prize-fighter seems to pass most of
his time out on hail, and to get his severest punishment
at the hands of the law.
* * *
Slavin and M'Auliffe have been bailed out for
£lO,OOO each, and summons have been issued against the
bettors who were the abettors of the conflict;.
* * *
The average newsnapet man pretends to know
more of law than a Q.C., of medicine than a physician,
&c., &c., but in this respect a sporting reporter beats
them all. He can criticise the riding of Halesor O’Brien,
yet would probably be foolish to trust himself on a nursery-
pony. In Sydney two of the so-called authorities on
pugilism are at daggers drawn, but each runs away when
he accidentally spies the other.

Martin Loughlin, now ih England, has sent over

Davis Dalton, who, it is said, s\Vam the Channel
—though there appears to be strongly-credible evidence
that he did nothing of the kind—is asserted to be a Jew.
A disbeliever in his feat offers him £5O if he will swim
from Blackball Pier to Gravesend—an easy feat for a man
who swam from Boulogne to Hythe.

Lady Carington flies to England oil Ist NoV. Lady
Hopetoun is billed to leave per Victoria on lltb inst.;
Lady Kinlore leaves during October for England, to place
“Inverurie” at the great Public School at Eton. The
desire to spend Xmas “ at Home ” seems to be catching.
Dan O’Connor has evidently not learnt
from experience. The stamp-advertising company
affair should have been a beacon to him in the
Postal Pillar Advertising Com party business.
What the public chiefly resent is the Unnecessary
secrecy surrounding both operations.
The Sydney papers made the very best of
I the Chowder larrikin riot on Eight-Hour Day. A
large number of plates and cups and saucers
appear to have been broken, but judging from the
casualties (consisting chiefly of one cut head and
two or three partially blackened eyes), the affair
seems to have been a storm in a tea-pot.
The new furniture warehouse of Messrs.
Wallach’s, Limited, York-street, is an ornament
to the city, and from an architectural point of
view a most handsome building. The show-
rooms, of which there are about 50, contain every
class of furniture, from “Early English ” to that
of the present period. Since the success achieved
by Messrs. Wallach in the awards secured
at the Intercolonial Exhibition held in Melbourne
in 1888, they have greatly extended their trade,
and have especially increased the manufacture of
high-class furniture in all departments. People
furnishing cannot do better than go and inspect
this magnificent stock.*
Ex-Parson Brentnall must be a weak man
to prosecute for defamation the wharf-labourer
who stood up and bluntly slanged him back in
Brisbane. The daily newspaper over which the
good shepherd presides, did not report the speech
complained of, but it did covertly refer to defen-
dant and his colleagues as ‘‘blatant and bellicose
agitators,” as “men who lived on others,” like-
; wise as “ bloodsuckers and parasites.” If Brent-
nall has been attacked he can surely kick back in
his paper. The man who loses such a golden
opportunity of exhibiting the 40-horse slang power
possessed by every preacher of the Word, doesn’t,
so far as journalism is concerned, know enough to
come in out of the rain.
It is surprising how widely opinions some-
times differ, even in reference to the most import-
ant problems of life. Some persons hold that
physical weakness, as a rule, is associated with
mental power, and that those of powerful physique
are usually of inferior mental capacity ; but, on a
closer observance and more careful study of the
1 subject, we find that these are exceptional cases,
I and that the association of perfect health of body
and mind is the rule. In these days the institution
of health societies are calculated to do an amount
j of good, but the general disregard shown to the
1 advantages living rightly, and the low value
set upon the blessings of health, comes before our
j notice every day. It is pleasing and encouraging
| to find that we have men amongst us who have
1 given much time and earnest attention to the
I subject of prevention and cure of the worst
] diseases that civilised humanity is heir to. Mr.
R,. J. Boulton, chemist, of Bourke-street, Mel-
! bourne, whose advertisement appears in another
j column,' has, after years of study and research,
discovered an inexpensive, speedy, and efficient
! cure for the most distressing diseases, more espe-
cially those of the nervous system. Mr. Ponlton
is successful where others fail, and may be con-
sulted either personally or by letter.*
ANTIPODEAN CLIMATE
MIDWINTER IN JUNE, MIDSUMMER IN DECEMBER
HAVE THEIR BANE AND ANTIDOTE.
The climate of this Australasian oohtinent of
ours, taken as a whole, is well suited to the
Europeans ; it is remarkably healthy, saving such
complaints as are not. generally fatal in their
tendencies, and which in a measure are more or
less common to all climates. Our climate is
peculiar in some tespects ; it is usually very dry,
and subject in summer to hot winds and periodical
droughts, and in winter to heavy rains. The
seasons are the reverse of those in England—
December being midsummer and dune midwinter.
But these conditions of temperature are in a phy-
sical "sense provocative t)f herve troubles from the
■long spells of dry Weather which merge into a
long continuance of wet. In consequence, among
the minor ills which affect the flesh, we have
neuralgia, but the bane has its antidote, as tin-
experiences which follow will show. Mr. Alt'.
May, of Boomanodmaiia, N.S.W., suffered atone
time terribly With neuralgia, and was cured by
St. Jacobs oil. S-cond Officer Win. 11. Hawes,
P.M.S.S. “ City of New York,” says : “ 1 obtained
-astonishing relief from acute neuralgia of the face
by using St. Jacobs oil.” Mr. W. 11. Mathieson,
the well-known coach builder, of Dee-street, In-
vercargill, N.Z-., says ; An apprentice of mine
■was taken ill with neuralgia, and became deliri-
ous. He found relief from one application of fit.
•Jacobs oil.” Mr. William Walker, (Walker,
Lemon, and Co.), 12, Lonsdale-street* Melbourne,
writes; ‘"I suffered from a severe attack of
■ neui-algia—pain intense—and after two applica-
tions of St. Jacobs oil the pain ceased magically,
and has never returned.” The death rate of the
Australasian colonies for 1880 was as follows :
New Zealand 11.46, Western Australia 13.24,
■ Queensland 13.59, Victoria 13.70, South Australia
14.85. New South Wales 15.57, Tasmania 16.12.
The mean of the colonies was 14.01. In England
and Wales the rate on an average of 30 years
appears to be 22.3.
A BROADCAST BLESSING.
The educational force of the Waterbury Watch
lias been felt all over the world. America, Europe,
Asia, Africa and Australasia have shared in its
civilising and encouraging impulse. The peasant
of the Russian Empire, the Kirghis on the steppes
of Asia, the Arab horseman of the desert, and the
Egyptian Fellaheen upon the Nile can, and do,
boast of a timekeeper, which for utility, accuracy,
and rough service is the peer of, and often more
to be relied upon, than any elaborately jewelled
pocket piece carried by .the nobility or richer
classes of their respective countrymen. In Japan,
throughout India, in the forests of Brazil, upon
the plains of Buenos Ayres, and in the furthest
baekbiocks of Australia the Waterbary Watch
has found its way, and wherever the people are
industrious there the Waterbary Watches are
worn ; there the people are becoming more punc-
tual, enterprising and successful.
A MASTER MARINER’S OPINION.
The popular Commander of s.s. Iberia writes as
follows to the Adelaide agent of the Waterbary
Watch Co. ;
“ Pacific Steam Navigation Company’s
“ R.M.S. Iberia,
Adelaide; 12th March, 1890.
“ Dear Sir,—l beg to state that I have carried
with me during the past two years one of the
short-winding Waterbury watches. It has proved
a most reliable timekeeper, and .1 find it most useful
at sea, as moving the hands about does not seem
to affect its accuracy. ; . ; N

THE DIPSOMANIAC.
Colonel North, of nitrate fame, writes a
Bulletin correspondent, in spite of all his
millions, is hardly allowed as yet to rank with the
princes of the financial world, a fact due, pro
bably to the said millions, although real enough at
present, existing entirely in South American
shares, the value of which might at any time be
an unknown quantity. A fat, coarse Yorkshire-
main, with plenty of rough good nature, he has
built himself a huge brick and marble abomination
at Eltham, in Kent, and here he entertains his
city friends and those offshoots of the aristocracy
whose souls hunger after “ information. ” Totally
lacking the insinuating subtility which have
rendered the equally fat Hebrew financiers so dear
to His Royal Highness, there is not much prospect
of the Colonel ever being allowed to air his carcase
to any great extent in the sun of Royalty's smile,
and his efforts at social notoriety will probably be
confined to the turf and the coursing field. When
the Colonel first arrived in London as a millionaire
he had one or two henchmen who knew the ropes,
and who were quite willing to devote their time to
a man who could make their fortune while thev
breakfasted with him. Lord Randolph Churchill
was the chief of them, and of another, Carleton
Blyth, the following good story is told. Going
one day into a hatter’s in Bond-street, Carleton
gave his hat to the assistant to procure another
like it. Standing bareheaded at the counter to
him enters the Bishop of Oxford. “Young man,”
he said, taking off his episcopal beaver, “ have you
a hat like this ? ” Blyth took it, examined it very
carefully, and then returned it to the astonished
prelate with the reply : “No, I haven’t, and if I
had I'll be d ——d if I’d wear it.”
Editor Bulletin.— My case is, I presume,
one of innumerable such cases. I am not an
acknowledged unionist, but still I am one of the
countless thousands of the unenrolled who. when
the time comes, will fall in and instinctively take
our places among those who demand that “ society
shall be re-constructed.” Read this, and tell me
if I have not reasons for hating the employer?
I left school twenty years ago, and as a lad found
employment with my present master, first as
errand-boy, then as assistant, then manager,
handling thousands of pounds annually—some-
times I was left in charge for six months while my
slave-driver “did the continent.” I married, and
now have a wife and three little children to pro-
vide for upon the munificent salary of £3 per
week, an advance to that sum having been given
to me eight years ago. Last week I was informed
by this great man that he intended retiring
from business, and that my services would not
be required at the expiration of his lease. He
lately inherited £70,000, paid nearly £10,000 for a
house, and retires because he is rich; yet I, who
have worked harder for him than he ever did for
himself, and have watched minutely his interests,
after twenty years’ service during which I have
never had a fortnight’s holiday, am coolly told at
a moment’s notice to “look oiit for other employ-
ment. ” Where is a mere clerk to get £3 a week ?
I he best years of life spent in faithfully serving
one employer have thus given me no more claim
on that employer’s consideration than if I were a
man whom he bad picked haphazard a week ago
out of the street. And yet the Employers’ Union
tell you that the workman is a faithless rascal, on
whose honor you cannot depend. What do my
long years of good faith avail me?— An Austra-
lian.
The Roscommon branch of the National

Madame Carette’s book of “Reminiscences

Now, look at the depravity of monarchs, who are
as indifferent as rabbits or cats to all moral
principles of good breeding, The EncyclopcediA
Beitannica tells us, without a shadow of doubt,
that the Count de Moray was illegitimate son of
Napoleon III.’s mother, Hortense, by a Flemish
dandy named Count de Flahaut. Yet Moray,
the bastard brother, was Louis Napoleon’s best
friend, and the Emperor himself was believed to
be the bastard son of Admiral Verhuel.
Mr. George Gill, of Emu Creek, lately
placed some trout-ova in the almost fishless
M‘Donald River, near Armidale, N.S. VV. The
local Express says that large numbers of fish are
now observable in the river, and about 90 were
caught lately on one evening, averaging about
8oz. The head is the head of a trout, and the fish
resembles trout to the belly, but from there to the
tip of the tail it is like an eel, with perfect eel
markings on portions of the skin. There is
no appearance of scales, and this again is eel-like.
The trout-ova, when placed in the river, appears
to have commingled with eel spawn and by a
curious freak of nature to have evolved an
altogether new fish. These fish when cooked are
stated to partake of the character of both eel and
trout.
The fluent and irrepressible Henry Geoi’ge
seldom comes to grief, but he was wrecked once
by the contumely of a coarse, unappreciative
audience. It was in San Francisco, on the famous
4th of July, and the apostle was firing off a great
baritone ovation which covered every subject
from infant damnation upwards. He told the
crowd how their fathers had howled when a tax
was put on their lawful prog, and how they had
been trailed thirteen miles on their ear while re-
sisting the encroachments of the British tyrant.
He spoke wildly about the time when the Ameri-
cans were licked at Bunker’s Hill, and how they
had put up a monument to celebrate the event,
and how Washington had got his hair and ears
full of mud while retreating through six different
States; and then the audience began to scream
with impatience, for the orator had gone on for
two hours and was less than halfway through his
manuscript. Then he deftly skipped a hundred
arid twenty pages and fired off his peroration. - “ A
thousand years hence who will'fight for liberty?’
A thousand years hence who will write for liberty ?
A thousand years hence who will speak for
liberty?” He ffiade an impressive pause there,
and a sad, slow, weary voice replied from the
gallery: “I believe you will, Henry George?”
And amid a fearful shriek of derision the orator
clutched his hat and put his manuscript on his
head by mistake, and escaped down the back-stair.
A Chinaman named Shake Hen has just

The American Vital Statistic authorities
refuse to accept any death-certificate giving as
cause “heart failure.” Such a certificate, they
claim, is a cloak for physicians’ ignorance of the
real cause of death or to cover up the facts. Quito

another But then the trouble is that all the

Tales of “The System.”
No. XIII.—The Wooing of Convict
Denham.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The “Cockney Kinchin” galloped furiously
up Wyhyard-street, Tumut, and flung himself off
his sweating horse at the police gate. Sergeant
Derby drew his six-feet-two of stalwart humanity
from his office-stool and as the Kinchin turned in
at the gate, crossed the verandah of the station-
house to meet that model of precocious thievery,
“Well, Kinchin,” interrogated the Sergeant,
“what’s the trouble; why are you in such a
hurry ?”
“ Oh, sir,” said the Kinchin, excitedly, “ there’s
a break-out at Latohford’s. Sheoak Jim an’ some
others ’as got tight an’ hev’ looked in th’ missus
an’ th’ gals in th’ store-room. I jist ’erd this, so
I saddles th’ mare an’ gallops in.”
“That’s right, Kinchin,” rejoined the sergeant,
taking down as he spoke his shako and pistol-
belts, “you’ve done yourself a good turn to-day,
perhaps. Have all the hands joined in the break-
out?”
“ Most on ’em, Sergeant.”
“ Have they got any shooters ?”
“ Billy the Lag, sir, ’as got an old flippin’-iron—
stole it from th’ stable, an’ I think as he ’as got
some of th’ pepper (powder), too.”
“Ah,” said Sergeant, “that’s bad, Kinchin lad.
When did the bother take place ?”
“Began ’bout three ’ours ago, sir, but I don’t
think as I took more'n an hour an’ a quarter to
come th’ 14 mile, Yer see, I c’u’dn’t get th’ nag
at once.”
“ Well, boy, you must go to Bombowlie for me.
You know my farm ?”
“Yes, sir,” said Kinchin.
“You’ll find Denham—Mister Denham—there.
Tell him to come up to the ford at once; you’re to
Walk here, for you’ll give him the horse. Now,
not a word, mind, to another soul except Denham
about this affair.”
“ Right, sir, I’m mum. I’ve tol’ nobody yet.”
The two separated—the convict youth to pro-
ceed to Bombowlie—the “country” immediately
across the Tumut stream was, and is, so called —
and the* police-officer to the Wool pack Inn, to
order a horse to be saddled for Mrs. Derby. By
the time Derby had done this, ha,d got his own
charger—a gift from Captain Sturt —ready for
the road, and had oommnnicated to his wife that
there was trouble at Hereford Station and she had
better slip on her habit and follow him, Denham
Was at the ford waiting for him. An exquisitely
beautiful spot that crossing-place, as you will
readily perceive if you stand raid-way on the
bridge which now spans the river. No prettier
bit of stream scenery can be viewed anywhere in
New South Wales. A stately reach banked with
willow-withes seems to spring from a sweeping
curve to the northward) where White glints in the
distance tell of a sandy beach, and to the south-
ward, Washes on the right hand groves of a classic
silence and solemnity, and on the left, meadows
and paddocks teeming with all the wealth of a
new land’s fertility .It is beautiful to-day; it
was, if possible, more beautiful on the afternoon
in February, 183—, when Convict Denham gazed
on it while he waited for the Sergeant.
He had been accustomed to delight in that scene
had Convict Denham; to revel in its English
aspect; and to picture himself, with a not irra-
tional fancy, rowing upon that splendid reach
with a swqet-faoed English girl for his companion.
He recalled these “ visions splendid ” as he looked
upon it in its February colouring; but they charmed
him no longer, for they were blurred into impos-
sibility. He looked upon the water and saw out-
lined in its green shimmer two gum-poles lashed
together to form an angle with a third tied to
their other ends as a base-line. To this triangle,
shadowy, but ah! so real —he saW attached by
cords a stripped form — his own!—writhing beneath
the lash. Ever present now to Convict Denham s
eyes was that most detestable of objects ; it had
shut out his view of all other things ; and he ad-
justed his notions of existence to : the very literal
angles of the soourger’s tripod much as a surveyor
bases his measurements to the abstract angles re-
flected by his instrument. Most men would, we
think, rearrange their ideas of life and duty after
being flogged unjustly.*
* * *
The flogging lay but a month back in the
past from the moment we meet Convict Denham
again; but Heavens ! what scenes of agony he
had gone through in the meantime ! Not a moment
of his waking existence since (and he had slept
little) but what he felt again the smart of the lash.
The sop and squelch of the_ blood which had
streamed from his back into his boots as stag-
gered across the police-yard from the “Ilogger’s
Corner ” to the shaded grassplot on which he had
thrown himself down to writhe and moan, and
moan and writhe, sounded incessantly in his ears.
And, as we have already said, his eyes had looked
since through the crossed poles at everything,
every duty, every creature. Put a sixpence close
to the eye, and it shuts out the sun. Place ihe
lash-thong similarly, and it will shut out all else.
And to Denham’s sight there Was now but one
focus—the cracker of whipcord, which was the
symbol of his pain and his humiliation.
The sense of his shame was remorselessly
gripping him while he waited the Sergeant’s
arrival. For the first time, however, since his
scourging, there was a sharp pleasure mixed with
it. He knew what a “break-out” meant, and
the knowledge came to him as a salve.
Convictdom under assignment was liable to
freaks of bloodthirstiness. Convictdom would
recollect and recall its wrongs and its tortures,
and would throw off its cowed demeanour and
submission; and in a horrid frenzy Convictdom
would tell its Masters and Mistresses What it
thought of them. It Would speak through the
agency of a bullet, and would as often as not add
a little emphasis to its remark with the in-
cendiary’s torch. Convictdom, in these efforts
of memory, had a capacity for showing how
dreadful a Thing the System had made of it. For
a downright devilish ingenuity in such circum-
stances you could back Convictdom against the
professor’s of Thuggee themselves. The command
of plenty of “Assigned Labour ” in early colonial
days built Up many a great fortune and permitted
the development of the country in many ways that
would have been impossible at the time had the
“assignment plan” not been in operation.. But
there was an awful Per Contra to the account.
Children ruined physically and morally by the
dreadful companionship ; households destroyed
by the insidious diabolism of crime ; theft and
arson, outrage and murder, made the common-
places of every-day talk ; the tree of wealth and
leisure bringing forth the noxious fruit of
vulgarity and sin instead of refinement and
culture —these formed part of the cost, and i
another portion would be contributed by the ;
“break-outs,” those spasms of recollection by i
which Convictdom would express its appreciation
of the treatment of years in a few lurid-moments
of lust and violence.
With these and such like phenomena of society as
framed by the System, Convict Denham in his
three years of expatriation had become perfectly
familiar, and so direful a change had been wrought
in the man within one short month by the paltry
punishment (as Messieurs the Administrators
deemed it to be) of “a couple of Botany Bay
dozens,” that, formerly zealous for every form of
good, he was now glowing with a fierce pleasure
at the chance that the rumour of a break-out at
Latchford’s would find the woman whose caprice
had subjected him to an infamous torture (as the
subjects of the Administrators regarded it) mur-
dered, or worse than murdered.
# * *
The Sergeant rode down to the ford at a
smart pace. Denham touched his cap as the
officer pulled up on the Bombowlie side of the
“Denham,” questioned Derby, “you’ve heard
the news?” _ ,
“ The Kinchin has told me simply that there s
a break-out —that’s all, except that you wanted
me.” . , ~
“Yes,” said Derby, looking at the other
steaddy, “ I want you to go with me.”
“Why, sir, may I ask!” The blood surged
quickly to Denham’s face, and as suddenly re-
ceded>
“ For several reasons. First, you are the only
man on whom I can rely, within easy calling
distance. Second, that the hands on the station
both feared and respected you when you were
overseer. I will represent the law, but you will
represent both justice and authority- ”
“She whipped my authority out of me,_
sneeringly interrupted Denham, “ and my manli-
ness, too, and with that, my desire to do justice.”
The sergeant held up his hand, and stopped the
rush of the other’s bitter words.
“ Say no more till you’ve heard my third reason,
I want you to go chiefly because I want to save
you from yourself. I hated a man once, and the
hatred was ruining not my life, but his. Then I
saved his life at the risk of my own, and I became
a new man from that hour—all the hate and
miserable passion left me, and left me a stronger
and, I believe, a better man. Come, do the same,
Denham. Save this woman from death, and
worse than death. If you can’t, I can’t. You
know the men thoroughly ; and only since—since
the flogging—have I known how you had influenced
them for the better. On my soul, Denham, I
believe this row is as much to revenge you as any-
thing else. Come, we’ve no time to lose.”
The Sergeant had spoken with an intense
rapidity that could not, however, disguise his
earnestness. His face fell as Denham rejoined,
with a slow precision that seemed cruel when
every moment was precious :
“ I won’t, Sergeant. You talk as though you
were speaking to a man, I’m not a man. Her
whip cut the man’s heart out of me.”
“ For God’s sake, don’t talk like that!’ cried
the Sergeant; “and, for my sake and Mrs.
Derby’s, if not for your own, come, I’ve done my
best to befriend you ”
“ You’ve been the truest friend that man ever
had,” muttered Denham.
r “ And my little woman gave up her friendship
with Kate Latch ford because of her ill-treatment
of you,” Derby went on. “Now, because I ask
you, because my wife would ask you if she was
here, come !”
For answer, Denham gathered up his bridle,
and turned his horse on to the Kiandra track.
Derby, without further words, saw he had gained
his point and, handing the convict a pair of
pistols, spurred his brave nag, Charlie, forward.
The Sergeant placed no exaggerated importance
on the probable value of Denham’s services in the
emergency which had arisen. There were two
ways open to him of subduing an outbreak on a
station in his district—one by tact, the other by
brute force. The latter was this time practically out
of the question. The nearest company of soldiers
was at Yass, and the nearest police-detachment
at Jugiong. Thanks to his justly-exercised
control, the Tumut district was one of the most
orderly in the colony, and first one and then
another of his “free” troopers had been with-
drawn to strengthen the force in other and dis-
turbed sections till he was left without a single
man under his local command except convict-
constables. Those fellows, as a class, were
notoriously unreliable when it came to a bloody
encounter with breakers-out or bushrangers. And,
as to “ free ” men who would prove useful if it
came to rushing a gang of infuriated prisoners,
the township could not boast of too many, and
these could not be taken from their homes. A
successful outbreak at Latch ford’s would spread
the virus of rebellion through the rims surround-
ing the township, and within 24 hours a ring of
flame and outrage might encircle the Settle-
ment. Darbylara, Minglec (Warby’s), Gundagai,
Stuckey’s at Willeplum, Kimo, Nanghas, Kubon-
dere and Jabtree (Ellis’) were all runs “carrying
heavy assigned labour,” and given one successful
revolt, the others almost certainly would be
bitten by the contagion. It was important
indeed, that the mere intimation of the trouble at
Latchford’s should not reach any other station till
it had been suppressed—or was successful—and
this was the reason why Derby had ordered the
“Kinchin” to keep silence. If affairs were
beyond control at Hereford, then he would send
Mrs. Derby —the bravest, most intelligent
messenger who ever crossed country (she would
ride anything anywhere)—with the news to the
next station, and the people there would pass it
on. But the Sergeant hoped there would be no
necessity for that course. The hands at Latch-
ford’s had found their position materially changed
for the worse since Denham’s departute. Denham
had taken so much of the management off Miss
Latchford’s shoulders that she felt unequal to
resuming responsibility immediately after she had
lost his services, and had temporarily appointed a
“ free ” employe to the overseer’s position. This
man knew little of Australian life, but one of the
few pieces of information which he had picked up
, was that the best way to manage Gov’mcnt men
| was to “ keep’em down.” That was a principle
of the System, and his limited acquaintance with
It had created in him a lively admiration of its
wisdom. Installed in power, he had put the
principle into operation and had “kept ’em
i down,” with the satisfactory result of the “ break-
out ” which Derby hoped to suppress by Denham’s
influence with the men rather than by the iron-
hand of the Law.

them out.” On they galloped without interchange
of words. The exercise was doing Denham good.
Pending orders from Sydney as to what was to be
done with him, he had been temporarily assigned
by Derby to Mrs. Derby, who owned a farm at
Bombowlie, and there the interval since the flog-
ging had been spent by the convict in brooding
over his fate. He had not been on horseback
during the month, and now the rapid motion
drove the black blood from his brain, and with it
some of the remembrance of his wrongs. Some,
not all.
They jumped the Been, a rushing torrent
in winter, but now wasted by summer heats
to a mere trickle: they skirted maize-fields,
the gold of whose early-ripening cobs was gleam-
ing amid pendulous leafage; they forced their
way, to shorten the journey, through- reedy
swamps, through clumps of white ■ blossomed
bastard-box, and of wattle with late-lingering
vellow crowns, and through shallow ponds
darkened by dense flocks of black ducks. They
startled the tinkling bell-birds into silence with
the clatter and clash of their rush, and roused the
laughing jackass from his siesta into a derisive
shrieking. A striding group of fat and oily black-
fellows returning from the Bogongs where they
had spent a dozen weeks in collecting and munch-
ing the luscious bugong moth, saluted the sergeant
with a chorus of gutturals ; and a teamster, whose
waggon groaned with wool of a dilatory shearing,
hailed Denham with a shout of sympathetic recog-
nition ; but neither heeded or halted. Now that
they were fairly afoot, both regretted the seeming
waste of time over their preliminary talk; and
each was saving breath and brain for the task of
rescue. It was a question of men’s lives and
women’s honour, and there was no time to be lost.
The horses were both well-blooded, and although
the one ridden by Denham had already done the
journey before that day, it answered as nobly to
its rider’s call as Charlie to the Sergeant’s.
They had both ridden an hour at a fierce pace
when the blue lines of the Bogong hills lost their
curves and their colour, and projected brown
ridges and peaks from the purplish tints; and
awhile later, a long, low-lying mass of whitish
vapour, covering the bottom range, became visible
to the horsemen.
“Smoke!” ejaculated the Sergeant. Denham
nodded. The vapour lay too low for clouds. And
the good horses leapt beneath the deep spurring
from which they had to suffer for the next minute.
A mile-and-a-half from the home paddock they
saw tongues of flame shooting out of the smoke,
and from some rising ground whence the home-
stead buildings could be usually seen by travellers
from Tuniut, the nest of glistening roofs could not
be observed through their murky shroud. Behind
a row of bloodwood trees the Sergeant reined up.
“The thing’s serious, Denham! Now, what’s
to be done ?”
“Let me go ahead, Mr. Derby, and find out
how things are. Seeing me alone the fellows will
not suspect aid, or that I know of the break-out.
You skirt round to the red-gums by the creek, and
I’ll call out or whistle if I want you. If you don’t
hear from me in half-an-hour you’d better come.”
So it was arranged. Denham hid his pistols, and
changed horses with the Sergeant, so that the
hands would not, by seeing him astride of one of
the best station horses, be led to conclude that he
had come out with any special knowledge of the
trouble.
# # *
Five minutes later Denham rode up to the
slip-panel of the home paddock. Half-a-dozen of
the more timid (or more sober) hands had gathered
there, and they hailed him wonderingly as he
took Charlie into their midst. From the enclosure
he could see that the homestead proper and one or
two of the outhouses were in flames,
“What’s up, boys?” he cried. “I saw the
smoke from the hill.”
“ A break-out, Mr. Denham. She-oak Jim an’
Billy th’ Lag got hold of th’ rum, an’ there’s been
th’ devil to pay,” replied two or three together.
“Ah, and where’s Miss —the mistress?”
“ They’ve got her locked up in th’ storeroom —
she an’ th’ gals. An’ ol’ Billy swears she shan’t
come out till she has promised to kiss him an’
Jim. They’re goin’ to smoke her out in ’arf-a-
hour if she don’t give in. An’ if she kisses them,
she’ll hev to kiss all th’ lot.”
“ Are you men in it ?” asked Denham.
“No, we ain’t in it,” said one, “but we’re left
here to get up the horses. I thinks three or four
on’em intend to take to th’ bush.”
“Why are you not trying to save the house or
the women ? Why don’t you get up the horses
and send word to Tumut or to Shelley’s ?”
“ Because,” said the assigned man, doggedly,
“ there are twenty-five or so agen us. An’ Billy
the Lag ’as got a pistol, an’ swears he’ll flip
any’un as interferes. An’ I ’udn’t bother ’bout
if I was you, Mr. Denham—you don’ owe her
nothink.”
“Oh, yes, I do,” said Denham, bitterly; “a
flogging.” The sharpness of his shame prompted
the remark, but the men accepted it as significant
that “ he wouldn’t bother.”
He asked another question or two, and then
told them to stay where they were, while he
would go and see “how things were going.” One
only of the group, a fellow he had found to be
pretty trustworthy, he asked to follow him to take
his horse.
Turning into the stable-yard, he was seen by a
number of the mutinous hands, who, more or less
drunk, had gathered in a knot to watch the pro-
gress of the flames. They greeted him with a cry,
and several of them moved stupidly towards the
storeroom, as though to warn their leaders of his
arri val.
“ Well, boys,” he said as he rode up, “having
some fun, eh?” He spoke with an attempt at
jocularity which would have deceived men who
were not drunk with rum and excitement.
“ Yes, Mr. Denham,” stammered a lifer —“an’
it’s all alon’ of yer.”
“ All along of me, how’s that ?”
“Yy,” muttered the lifer, “we’re revengin’
that there ticklin’ yer got. We ain’t goin’ to hev
no other ov’seer’n yer.”
“That’s it, is it,” said Denham. “Well, I’m
much obliged to you.”
His ready-wittedness saw in the temper of mind
indicated by the men’s attitude to himself an
opportunity for solving the terrible problem as to
how he should restore order.
“ Now, boys, look here; you know I’ve a grudge
against Madam.”
“Yes, yes ! ” roared a dozen voices.
“ I hate her worse than any of you do, for I did
more for her than anyone, and she treated me
'worse, didn’t she? ” lie spoke the truth ; he •''•d
resolved to save her, for all that, if he could.
“That she did ! ” was the chorus.
“Well, now, what do you say to making me your
Captain? You’re in a scrape whatever happens
and Jirn and Billy are not the men to get you out
of it.”
“Yer right, - Mr. Denham,” blurted out the
lifer. “Yer shall be our Cap’n. That’s so, ain’t
it, chummios ?”
The semi-drunken group sent up an erratic
cheer in assent. Denham dismounted, and throw-
ing his rein to the man who had followed him
from the paddock, told him to ride the horse down
to the red-gum clump by the creek.
“You know the nag, boys?” he said, “It’s
Sergeant Derby’s charger—he lent it to me for a
gallop, and I wouldn’t like old Charlie to be
injured, and he’ll get mad if he sees much more of
these flames.”
This was a master-stroke of policy on Denham’s
part, and gave the wretches who surrounded him
the strongest possible evidence of his intention to
help and not to thwart them. Sending away the
horse in charge of one of their number was a good
thing, for it showed Denham was going to stay ;
and their knowledge that the animal was the Ser-
geant’s was re-assuring in the extreme —for it
meant, didn’t it, that Derby was taking it easy in
Tumut, 14 miles away ? So the muddled intel-
lects reasoned. The poor fools could not know,
of course, that Derby was waiting behind the
gums, and would at once understand by the
arrival of his charger that Denham wanted him at
the homestead.
The messenger despatched, Denham proceeded
to make the most of the interval that must elapse
before the Sergeant could arrive. His first care
was to distribute the men. He sent half the
number to the horse-paddock to assist in rounding
up the nags.
“You’ll want a horse apiece, boys,” lie said;
“better get ’em all up at once.”
Others he sent into the stables, harness-room,
and men’s huts to get the harness and saddlery
together. Three —fellows he considered he could
most easily intimidate or persuade—he retained
with him.
“Now, chaps,” he cried to these last, “you'd
better >ome with me to where the She-oak and
Billy are.”
They followed him up to the storeroom —one of
a number of weatherboarded buildings standing
detached fi’om the main structure. A curved
passage connected it with other outbuildings. As
they passed the room which had served him for an
office, a shaft of flame from the fire that was fast
devouring the great house sent a brilliant gleam
through the window.
“ Jake,” exclaimed Denham, “bring me out the
darbies hanging up in that room.”
The man stared in surprise. “Wot for? Yer
ain’t a-goin’ ter play us false ?” he asked, with a
sudden alarm in his tones.
“False! you fool,” rejoined Denham, “why
should I? Don’t you remember Kate Latchford
snapped the bracelets on my wrists with her own
hands? Well, I’m going to return the compli-
ment.”
The three fellows roared with delight, and
Convict Jake rushed into the office - the door had
been previously broken open by the mutineers—
and brought out the hand-cuffs.
“’Ere yer are, Mr. Denham; Lor’, they’ll be
th’ nattiest bracelets madam ever ’ad on ’er. ”
John Denham took them. He’d have given
years of his life, he thought, to have done what he
had told the fellows he proposed doing. But he
never wavered in his resolve to save her.
He was now within a few feet of the storeroom,
and the roar and crackle of the flames becoming
more subdued, as the fire exhausted itself, he
could overhear the blackguardly colloquy of the
ruffians outside the storeroom door.
“So Boss Denham’s there, Bill,” hiccoughed
She-Oak Jim. “ Wonder wot he’s a-doin’ ’ere ?
Put a ’ole in him, Bill, if he bothers ns—yer’ve got
th’ gun.”
“That I will, ” shouted Bill; “but he’s arter
revenge himsel’, I’ll take my davy. He don’ owe
no love to this ’ere jade.”
Denham swung himself into the passage at this
moment, and joined in the talk. “ You’ve just
hit it, Bill,” he said; “I want my revenge, too.
Now, I’m going to lead in this row. All the men
outside have agreed—isn’t that so, chaps ? ” he
turned for corroboration to his three followers.
Jake and the others swore it was so. “The
Boss is cool, Jim,” the former said ; “ and yer
warm an’ tight, yer know, an’ we wan’ a cool ’ed
ter think for us when th’ traps an’ th’ sodgers are
arter us.”
“ Oh,” cried Jim ; “ I’m ’greeable, but look ’ere,
Denham, we’re all a-goin’ to kiss the Missus —we’re
sworn it, an’ we’ll do it. We’re a-goin’ to take th’
Bogong beauty down a peg, ain’t we, Bill, ol’
pal ? ”
Denham intimated that they could do as they
liked with Miss Latchford, “once they got her.”
“ She’s got five minutes more to come out an’
kiss us,” said the blackguard Jim; “an’ then if
she don’t, we’re a-goin to break in, or, if we can’t,
we’ll smoke ’er out. ” ■
“ Well, give her that time,” said Denham, “but
how do you know she hasn’t got through the win-
dow on the other side? Bill, you and Jake had
better go and make sure. You’d better guard
that till I come. We may have to root the Beauty
out of her nest that way. ”
The two convicts unsuspiciously acted on the
hint. Their departure left Denham in company
with the chief scoundrel, Jim, and the other two
hands who had followed him from the yard. One
of the other fellows he commissioned to go to the
horse-paddock with the instruction to bring news
how many horses were in. The other—a stalwart
young Englishman whom he had specially be-
friended when acting as overseer—lie ordered to
stand by the passage entrance, so that if the
women made a rush he could stop them.
“Lor’, yer’ve got a ’ed, Boss,” said Jim. “I
never thort o’ that.” And then the wretch, with
an air of drunken gravity, pulled out a gold watch,
a fragment of the household loot, and, glancing at
it, ejaculated “Time’s up!” and began to beat
with his hands upon the door. “ Time’s up,
Kate, my darling—l wan’ thet kiss —an’ there’s
’nuther friend o’ yourn ’ere’ll take one, too—an’ —”
He had got thus far with his speech when the
butt of one of Denham’s pistols crashed on his
head, and he fell, a senseless heap, against the
door. In a second the “Boss” bad locked the
“darbies ” on to his hands.
Hearing the crash, Steve, the young prisoner
whom he had placed at the end of the passage,
came running up. Denham covered him with his
pistol. “Now, Steve,” he cried to the amazed
and affrighted assigned man, “if you’re wise,
you’ll help me—the police ’ll be here in a few
minutes and the game’ll be up. What do you
say ? ’
Steve, whose heart had not been in the work,
and who had joined in it under coercion, threw
up his hands and stammered out that he would do
as Denham told him.
“ Then, go to the front garden, and when you
see Sergeant Derby send him here.”
Derby coming from the creek would approach
the homestead on the other side from the horse-
paddock and stables, and might thus reach the
storeroom unobserved by the mutinous hands.
Steve ran off, a final caution from Denham fol-
lowing him that if he went to the men instead of
waiting for the Sergeant, one of Denham’s bullets
should be reserved for him. So far the ex-over-
Beer’s plan liad been successful, but every moment
was now doubly precious. If any of the hands
came back from the stables or horse-paddock
before the arrival of the officer the results might
still be disastrous.
He tried to attract the attention of those in the
storeroom. “Miss Latchford, it is I, John
Denham. Sergeant Derby will be here shortly. Be
ready to open the door.”
Thus he spoke, but had to repeat his words.
The women had closed their ears apparently,
doubtless because of the grossness with which
they had been assailed. At last he made them
understand, and from behind the door Denham
heard words which told him he was understood,
and then the noise of the boxes of stores being
removed with which they had barricaded the
entrance. And then there was another sound—
the clatter of hoofs as Derby rode Charlie into the
cobbled yard.
A few hurried words informed Derby of the
position.
“Two men against twenty or thirty would
have been useless, but I have distributed their
force,” said Denham ; and the Sergeant thanked
him heartily.
“We’ll fix Bill,” he said, “and then get Kate
out. She’d be worth a couple of constables if she
had a pistol.”
They went round and “ fixed ” Bill. Bill had
tried to climb to the sill of the storeroom-window,
and had fallen in the attempt. As the rescuers
turned the building he lay on the ground and
was speedily handcuffed. Jake, at the sight of
the Sergeant, went on his knees and begged for-
giveness. This being granted conditionally he
was left to guard Bill, and the Sergeant promised
not to forget him if he was faithful to the
command.
The Sergeant’s well-known voice caused the
women to fling the door open. There were six of
them in the room and Free-Overseer Joynt—the
latter helpless from a wound received in the first
assault of the breakers-out. Miss Latchford was
in their midst, looking little less proud and com-
posed than usual. She greeted Derby with a
brave smile, but there was a quiver in her voice
as she addressed her former manager, that to any-
one who knew her, expressed a volume of emotion.
“You here, John ?” she said —she had never
previously called him by his Christian name—
“l thank you !” Derby interposed that this was
not the time for thanks —they had still to face the
majority of the men. And then she asked for a
pistol. Denham handed her the one taken from
Bill. She wanted to know what she had to do.
Derby told her his idea was that they should lock
up the two ringleaders, Jim and Bill, in the store-
room, with Jake and Steve as a guard, and that
tire three of them—Denham, himself and herself—
should attack the other men. “Three of us
against twenty’s big odds, but they’ve lost their
leaders and we’re armed. And, besides, we’ll be
able to take ’em in two lots, as Denham separated
them.” This was the first intimation that Kate
Latchford had received of Denham's successful
strategy, and she looked at him gratefully. But
he’avoided her glance.
Before another half-hour passed, order reigned
once more on Hereford Station. Three pistol-
barrels confronted the men who wore gathering
the harness, and forced them back into the stables,
where they were doubly-locked in, with ample
leisure to contemplate the futility of human ambi-
tion. And as with the men at the stables,
so with those fellows at the paddock. They had
rounded up a couple of dozen nags and had roped
them to the panels. Visions of “Denham’s
Gang” and of bushranging exploits that would
rival Mike Howe’s and Tallboy’s in brilliancy had
danced before their eyes also ; but the Sergeant’s
voice and protruding pistol, backed up by two
equally-effective arguments controlled by their
mistress and Denham, brought them to their
senses. _
In the evening light, as the last timbers of the
homestead hissed and flickered into glowing
embers, two carts drove Tumutwards from Here-
ford horse-paddock. Mrs. Derby drove the first :
it contained the women-hands and the wounded
overseer. Kate Latchford drove the second,
whose living freight, bound and handcuffed, was
made up by half-a-dozen of the principal muti-
neers.' By the side of the latter cart rode Derby,
with pistoi-arm ready. Denham, aided by Steve,
stopped behind to guard the rest of the breakers-
out.
# # #
The particulars of the break-out above
related are necessary for the understanding of the
sequel. Till the occurrence of the mutiny Miss
Latchford had not seen Denham or the Sergeant’s
wife since that wretched day when she had
driven the former to Tumut to receive his flogging.
Stricken by remorse for her share in that incident,
and by a genuine sorrow that it had deprived her
of the great and esteemed friendship of Mrs.
Derby, she had even more than was usual with
her confined her excursions within the station
boundaries. Consequently she had seen abso-
lutely nothing of Convict Denham or “the little
woman,” and only once had she come into contact
with the Sergeant, who, to tell the truth, intended
to give her a very wide berth indeed, except in
those rare moments when his official duties as
chief police-officer of the district, and as assistant
muster-master of the station, he had to visit
Hereford. But on the night of the break-out she
gladly availed herself of the hospitality tendered
by Mrs. Derby. The little woman was still indis-
posed to forgive the mistress of Hereford, but
when the incendiary blaze had reduced Hereford
homestead to a heap of ashes there was, of course,
nothing to be done but to welcome its owner once
more to her home and heart. So the little woman
thought, and her big husband agreed with her.
And in the quiet of the night, the wealthy and
proud lady sobbed at her penitence on the bosom
of the policeman’s wife.
There was one thing, however, which she did
not tell Mrs. Derby, not even when her friend,
who had learnt the facts from the Sergeant, re-
lated that it was due to Denham’s tact that she,
Kate, had escaped an awful fate.
* * * *
The Sergeant went out with the Police-
Magistrate to Hereford the next morning, and
began an investigation. Denham returned with
him, as all was quiet at the station. At the police-
gate he met with Mrs. Derby. She asked him to
go in to her sitting-room, and wait for her. He
went in—and found Miss Latchford there. He
would have left at once, but she placed herself
before the doorway, and said, humbly: “Den-
ham, John—will you forget and forgive?”
He looked at her amazed. The haughty Miss
Latchford suing for the forgiveness of a convict!
He could not believe his senses, and remained
silent.
“John,” she repeated, “will you not forgive
me ? Do—and come back to the station.”
Then he flamed into bitter speech.
“Oh, Miss Latchford, that’s it, is it? You’ve
missed the poor .convict who served you for three
years more faithfully than a free man would have
done. You’ve discovered your mistake now thp,t
it has cost you five or six thousand pounds—it’ll
cost you that to make good yesterday’s damage,
at least
“Before Heaven, John,” cried the humiliated
girl, “ I had no such thought. I ask you to come
because there is no other way I can do you justice
■ —not because of the profit to myself.”
“Go back—to be flogged for a whim again!
Thank you, madam.” He tried to speak with an
ironical politeness, but he could hot retain his
control. He poured out a stream of lava-like
words that scarred her consciousness as indelibly
as volcanic torrents ridge and rend a fair land-
scape.
“ Go back—to struggle and strive for you—and
to be whipped like a cur —no, not like a cur, for
no man whips his dog as the System whips ns!
Go back—to be the slave of your caprice, and to
have your whims tallied on my flesh by Slyde’s
patent cat ?Go back—to coin money for the
beautiful Miss Latchford, of the Bogongs, and to
be spurned by her foot for four more long years?
Don’t you know, you, who boast of your know-
ledge of the King’s Regulations, who can quote
chapter and verse from that Devil’s Bible, that
you have cancelled my right to a ‘ticket,’ through
your cursed temper—the temper that you in-
herited from your old lag of a father, with his old
lag’s wealth?" Don’t you know I’ve got to serve
my full term now—and serve it as a marked and
flogged man? Don’t you know that—you who
bade the scourger flog the heart out of me as well
as the scarf-skin off my back ?Go back ! Aye, I
will ’’—and he hissed his concluding words with
an intense passion that appalled her—“ I will-
only when I have power to snap the handcuffs
on to your wrist as you snapped them on to mine,
and to flay you with the lash as you flayed me. Go
back I will—then, and not till then !”
She stood for a moment, stupefied by this out-
burst, and her magnificent colour gave place to a
ghostly pallor. Suddenly, she turned and rushed
from the room. It might have been a half-
minute that she was absent, no longer—so brief a
time, that Denham was still in the toils of his
frenzy.
She flung herself at his feet, and held out her
hands which grasped the two things of which he
had spoken. She had brought from the Sergeant’s
office a pair of handcuffs, and the police-scourger’s
cat-o’-nine-tails. • • _
■ “Here,” she cried, with a piteous sob in her
voice,” here—take these—handcuff me, flog me,
humiliate me as you choose, but forgive me !”
“Bah !” he said, after one glance of wonder at
her attitude, “ I was flogged on my bare back !”
For answer, she threw the hideous things down,
and clutched at her dress, as though she would
have torn it open. Then, the modest instincts of
her sex recalled her to herself. She rose,
trembling, and, burying her face in her hands,
stammered, painfully—
“ Come back, John —come back, but not—not
as my servant—but as my—husband !”
# # *
A fearful temptation shaped itself before
Convict Denham as he heard her words. His
heart throbbed to the core with vindictiveness.
What a revenge might be his if he married this
proud suppliant! He didn’t doubt she made the
offer in sincerity —and then to marry her, and
become a free man—for her wealth would purchase
his freedom (such bargains were made daily) to
marry her, and then torture her. All that was
vile, and sordid and sensuous, in his being bid him
say “ yes ”to this strange wooing.
But the sweet girl-face that he has seen reflected,
by the river-ripples in his day-dreams rose with
pure vividness, and hid both the spiritual tempta-
tion, and the actual, breathing form of the beauti-
ful woman—never so beautiful as in her shame—
who thus sought to atone for the wrong she had
wrought him.
So he said, simply, “ Miss Latchford, I couldn t
marry you—if 1 would; for I have a wife in
England,”
If he had known it, he was fully revenged. Kate
Latchford had learnt to love him with all the force
of a rich, undisciplined nature. But only when
she had punished him, had she understood. This
was the thing she had not dared to tell Mrs.
Derby.

As the terms upon which patients are treated, viz.,
NO CURE NO FEE, enables all sufferers to avail
themselves of this remarkable opportunity of
obtaining a speedy and effectual cure. Dr. Jenkins
wishes it to bo distinctly understood that he does
not rely upon the issue of books, more often never
written by the persons whose names they bear, and
are mere traps for the unwary, but honestly and
straightforwardly treats his patients according to
